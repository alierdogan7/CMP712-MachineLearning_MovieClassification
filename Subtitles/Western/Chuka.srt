1
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,843
...and I respectfully submit...

2
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,887
that the devastation
from the attack...

3
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:58,890
on November 17 and 18,
on Fort Clendennon...

4
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,417
commanded by Colonel Stuart Valois...

5
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:08,166
formerly with the Fifth Lancer
Brigade, British Army in India...

6
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,997
being so complete...

7
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,470
even to the poisoning
of the water well...

8
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,269
that the post be abandoned...

9
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:20,470
and no rebuilding and manning
of Clendennon be attempted.

10
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,114
Information gathered from Hanu...

11
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,319
War Chief of the Arapaho war party...

12
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:32,886
captured with his followers,
November 23, 1876...

13
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,624
reveals that plans...

14
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:40,656
for the attack had been under
consideration for several months...

15
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,461
and was motivated by lack of food...

16
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,905
and insufficient
equipment and supplies...

17
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,872
for the Arapahos to
care for themselves.

18
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:56,237
Hanu's story is
substantiated by the fact...

19
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,379
that all food and
stores in the fort...

20
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,678
were found to have been removed...

21
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,451
as well as the guns and ammunition.

22
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,862
The single exception...

23
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,793
being a handgun...

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,525
that was discovered
under the stairwell.

25
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,333
Hanu further states
that the revolver...

26
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,297
belonged to a civilian.

27
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,736
In Hanu's words...

28
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,308
a strange, lone man...

29
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,908
<i>who had ridden in from the north.</i>

30
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,565
- You ladies all right?
- Fine, thank you.

31
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,344
Ladies...

32
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,642
this won't take long at all.
We'll be out of here in...

33
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,196
- You got a crowbar?
- Yeah.

34
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,457
Get it.

35
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,675
Lucky.

36
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,078
I don't know lucky, but
we all ought to be dead.

37
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,386
Why don't we get this wheel on
and get the hell out of here?

38
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,963
Get up in there!

39
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:39,996
Hike!

40
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,926
Open the gates!

41
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,250
- Carry on, Sergeant Hahnsbach.
- Yes, sir!

42
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,319
Carry on, Corporal!

43
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,838
As you were.

44
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,735
- Sir, the sentence has been carried out.
- Very good, Sergeant.

45
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,073
From this point forward...

46
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,944
punishment for desertion will
no longer be by whipping...

47
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,885
but by a firing squad.

48
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,090
- The troop is yours, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

49
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,031
Troop dismissed!

50
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,774
Ladies, welcome to Fort Clendennon.

51
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,248
I am Colonel Valois. This is my
executive officer, Major Benson.

52
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,510
Ladies.

53
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,952
<i>This is Señora Veronica Kleitz...</i>

54
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,919
<i>and that there is
Señorita Helena Chavez.</i>

55
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,987
This is the Colonel.

56
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,799
<i>A deserter, señora, and a thief.</i>

57
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,667
Please don't allow the actions...

58
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,266
and, therefore, the discipline
of one man to disturb you.

59
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,940
In a lifetime, Colonel Valois...

60
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,209
I've learned that one man
is the image of all men.

61
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,909
<i>Have you, señora?</i>

62
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:43,211
And now, perhaps you'd like to freshen
up before continuing your journey.

63
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,847
- Major.
- Colonel?

64
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:48,416
I'm sure you would like to
escort the ladies to my quarters.

65
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,722
Thank you, Colonel.

66
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,422
This way, ladies.

67
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:53,858
Howdy.

68
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,658
She kind of...

69
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,967
cut your water off,
didn't she, Colonel?

70
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,199
You reek of whiskey, Trent.

71
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,967
Not exactly the quality one
looks for in a chief scout.

72
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,011
Who's that?

73
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,684
I don't know.

74
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,514
Looks kind of mean, don't he?

75
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,787
That, sir, is a hired gun...

76
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,159
called Chuka.

77
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,220
Begging your pardon, sir.

78
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,892
What's he doing here, Baldwin?

79
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,095
We met him on the trail, Sergeant.
He helped us with a busted wheel.

80
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,502
Well, that was nice of him, wasn't it?

81
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:39,240
Right about that time, some Indians
come out of the dust and give us a look.

82
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,869
- A look?
- Yep.

83
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,247
You mean they didn't try to stop you?

84
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,580
Nope, just give us a long look.

85
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,247
Well?

86
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:56,624
Well, Hanu. I told you what
I thought a long time ago.

87
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,762
Why don't you ask him? He just
come through his territory.

88
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,568
Maybe he smells better than I do.

89
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,506
That wouldn't be difficult, Trent.

90
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:18,044
Mister, this is the commanding
officer of Fort Clendennon...

91
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,682
Colonel Stuart Valois.

92
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,652
Colonel, I'd like to stay here overnight if
it's all right with you. Any place will do.

93
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,453
Where are you from?

94
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,485
Anywhere I happen to be.

95
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,324
All right, Sergeant.

96
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,161
Did you see anything
unusual on your way in?

97
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:40,537
If you mean that good-looking
young chief, he was pretty unusual.

98
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,131
Yes, I know about him. Anything else?

99
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:48,076
A lot of starving old women,
starving old men, little tiny kids.

100
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,173
They're often hanging around the
fort. We have to run them off.

101
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,276
Why do you run them off? Why
don't you feed them, Colonel?

102
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:58,221
My orders are to see that they move south
to new hunting grounds in the winter...

103
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,780
back north in the summer.

104
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,951
Nothing more, nothing less.

105
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,128
Would you mind standing
up when I'm talking to you?

106
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,535
All right, Colonel.

107
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,573
Thank you.

108
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,276
I've discovered, Mr. Chuka...

109
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,774
that to a savage,
kindness means weakness.

110
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,110
He'll despise you for it.

111
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,316
The moment you turn your
back, he'll put a knife in it.

112
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,087
I offer you that piece
of intelligence, sir.

113
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,654
It might save your life one day.

114
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,061
Colonel...

115
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,962
they're awful hungry out
there, and I think they're mean.

116
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:47,164
And unless you give them food,
or the rifles to hunt their own...

117
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,799
they're going to come
in here and take it.

118
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,868
There's a little piece of intelligence
that might save your life sometime.

119
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,210
Did you see any kind
of a patrol out there?

120
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:59,011
I saw exactly what
I told you, Sergeant.

121
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,114
- Three troopers?
- No.

122
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:07,919
- You mind telling me where I bed down?
- Yes. The stables.

123
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,489
And there'll be no whiskey
drinking or smoking.

124
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,927
- Understand?
- I understand, Sergeant.

125
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,805
He wasn't so mean after all.

126
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,014
What he said made a
lot of sense, Colonel.

127
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,677
- All right, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

128
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,550
My patrol is overdue.

129
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,921
Your stage can't leave
until my scout finds out why.

130
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,322
Yes, sir. I'll get
the ladies' baggage.

131
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,289
- Better get started, Trent.
- Yes, sir. I thought...

132
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,729
I'd just get some chow
and then I'd be on my way.

133
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,100
Don't be too long.

134
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,196
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

135
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,712
If there's anything I can do to
make you ladies comfortable, just...

136
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,751
Just another saddle bum,
looking for a free meal...

137
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,194
and a place to sleep.

138
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,423
Major?

139
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,531
I wouldn't let him hear
you call him no saddle bum.

140
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,094
He's called Chuka, and he's fast...

141
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,804
awful fast.

142
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,477
<i>- Señora?
- Yes?</i>

143
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,412
I'm sorry, but we'll
be here overnight.

144
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,646
Here? I don't understand.

145
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,656
The Colonel won't let
the stage go through...

146
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,022
and I guess he wants you to spend
the night here in his quarters.

147
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,426
Very well. Thank you, gentlemen.

148
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,561
- Major.
- Ladies.

149
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,561
Aunt Veronica?

150
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,405
Do you think there is a danger?

151
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,973
No, I think Colonel Valois
is just being cautious.

152
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,815
Why didn't you say hello to him?

153
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,048
What are you talking about?

154
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,089
Mr. Chuka.

155
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,128
You knew him.

156
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,998
I could tell.

157
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,058
The name is even familiar.

158
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,170
I remember a story
you told me long ago...

159
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,508
<i>about the young man on
your father's rancho.</i>

160
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,908
<i>There were many young
men on my father's rancho.</i>

161
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,652
But now I mustn't think of
young men or talk of them.

162
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,712
I am promised.

163
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,515
You have given your word.

164
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,754
- My father has given his word.
- It's exactly the same thing.

165
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,463
You will do nothing against
your father's wishes.

166
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,336
As long as he keeps his place...

167
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,774
I don't care what his
reputation is as a gunfighter.

168
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,903
- But, sir, this man is a bad...
- At this moment, Sergeant...

169
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,540
I'm more concerned with
an overdue patrol...

170
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:21,313
than I am with a single
gunfighter sleeping in the stables!

171
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,082
Yes, sir.

172
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,253
- Have a drink, Otto.
- Thank you, sir.

173
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,801
What do you make of it?

174
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,563
I don't like it, Colonel.

175
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,869
Neither do I.

176
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,873
Neither does Trent.

177
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,649
I've warned the General at Fort Wallace
half a dozen times. Look at this.

178
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,586
"Hanu wouldn't dare." Or this one...

179
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,181
"It would be suicide for
Hanu to attempt anything...

180
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,218
"with Forts Wallace, Dodge, Hays,
Bascom, and Garland so close."

181
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,591
And this is the best of all.

182
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,537
"Your men could not be
depended upon in a fight."

183
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,707
They'll measure up, sir.

184
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,199
Yes, of course, Sergeant.

185
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,880
- After all, we've trained them,
 haven't we?  - Yes, sir.

186
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:28,650
<i>The ladies, are they quite
comfortable? Señora what's-her-name...</i>

187
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,621
Kleitz, sir. They're
in your quarters, sir.

188
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,283
They're in your quarters.

189
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:37,886
Yes.

190
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,956
I mean, if I send a
dispatch rider for help...

191
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,970
and then Hanu doesn't attack...

192
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,137
Anyway, there's no guaranteeing...

193
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,301
he'll get through if Hanu
is planning something.

194
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,479
I just wish I had a good British
regiment under me instead of these...

195
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,911
Everything will be fine, sir.

196
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,487
Yes, Otto.

197
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,354
I'm sure it will be.

198
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,991
Just one more thing, Sergeant.

199
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,795
As the ladies have to
spend the night here...

200
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,630
I'd like to make things as
pleasant as possible for them.

201
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,967
- How do you mean, sir?
- We'll have a dinner party.

202
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,973
Full complement of
officers, best rations...

203
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,402
and see that the mess waiters
wash their gloves, will you?

204
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,708
Yes, sir. Like old times, sir.

205
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,577
And one more thing.

206
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,145
Ask the gunfighter.

207
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:38,082
- The saddle bum, sir?
- Yes. Mr. Chuka.

208
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,849
He won't exactly grace the table...

209
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,524
but he intrigues me.

210
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,855
I'll invite the ladies myself.

211
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,806
Well, now, take it easy. I'm friendly.

212
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,310
All right, come on out in
the light. Let me see you.

213
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,817
It's you.

214
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,590
Hanu's got me jumping at shadows.

215
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,125
Who are you? What do
you do around here?

216
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,560
Trent.

217
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,063
Post scout.

218
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,759
Kind of late in the day
to be going out, ain't it?

219
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,362
That's what they pay me for, mister.

220
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,108
They pay you enough?

221
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,846
I'm eating regular. How are you doing?

222
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,847
If that satisfies you.

223
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,945
Go on back in your stall
and finish getting drunk.

224
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,546
You got a big mouth for an old man.

225
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,629
Tough, too.

226
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,271
Thanks.

227
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,004
Nobody's got an easy job, Mr. Trent.

228
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,942
I don't know. Pretty good job here.

229
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:19,119
When I get to see what Hanu fixed,
I'll come back to good old Clendennon...

230
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,456
for the winter months and
curl up, nice and toasty...

231
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,894
go down to Mexico for a blowout
every now and then to get a little...

232
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,989
Maybe I'll come with you.

233
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,596
See you when you get back, Mr. Trent.

234
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,271
<i>Adios.</i>

235
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,854
- Open them up.
- Right.

236
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,192
- Well?
- It's good.

237
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,062
Thanks.

238
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,664
Slim.

239
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,398
How long you've been in Clendennon?

240
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,440
After the first month or so, you
forget about time. It's like jail.

241
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:52,142
- You can always bust out of jail,
 can't you?  - No.

242
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:56,085
59 miles north to Granada,
63 south to Stone Creek...

243
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,555
and all of it across hard
land. Then you got him.

244
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:11,067
A soldier deserts, looks bad for a
commanding officer, even at Clendennon.

245
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,229
And that there Hahnsbach...

246
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:17,071
I guess he's the best professional
soldier in the whole world.

247
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:20,873
- Dismiss the troop, Corporal.
- Troop dismissed!

248
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,240
Stack your rifles.

249
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,275
You.

250
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,790
You are talking to me, aren't you?

251
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,418
The Colonel wants you
to have supper with him.

252
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,587
Officers' Mess, 8:00 sharp.

253
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:43,366
Wear a clean shirt, if you've got
one. You'll be dining with ladies.

254
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,269
I'll keep me eye on the Colonel.
He'll teach me how to behave.

255
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,807
And shave, saddle bum!

256
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,021
- Sentry.
- Yes, sir.

257
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,457
I want to know the moment Trent
returns. Pass it on to your relief.

258
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:09,788
Yes, sir.

259
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,460
As you were!

260
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,290
- Yes?
- It's Colonel Valois.

261
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,235
- May I come in, ladies?
- Please do.

262
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,268
It was kind of you, Colonel,
to allow us your quarters.

263
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,334
<i>It's my pleasure, señora.</i>

264
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,139
And, may I add, a very rare one.

265
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,683
Our little American stronghold in the
West is seldom given the opportunity...

266
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:40,748
to offer hospitality to
two such charming ladies.

267
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,292
I hope we haven't inconvenienced you.

268
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:47,957
<i>On the contrary, señora, I was hoping
you would both do me the honor...</i>

269
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,762
of dining with me this evening.

270
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:54,794
If you will, I will be my most unselfish
and allow some of my officers to join us...

271
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,040
and share in my pleasure.

272
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,973
We'll be delighted to.

273
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,306
Thank you, Colonel.

274
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,407
Thank you, ladies.

275
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,719
<i>It's the conversation, señora.</i>

276
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:16,521
Colonel?

277
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,356
The conversation.

278
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,967
It will be wonderful...

279
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,901
to dine...

280
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,233
instead of to feed...

281
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,565
which seems to be the routine...

282
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:35,204
when men in a country
like this are isolated.

283
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,575
I miss the conversation...

284
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,920
and the elegance of
dining in mixed company.

285
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,627
<i>Your presence here
this evening, señora...</i>

286
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,965
will allow me to reach
back to some very...

287
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,529
pleasant memories.

288
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,445
Nobody saw you?

289
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,715
Nobody except old Badger
and Clyde here, and Slim.

290
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,859
- You didn't see anything, did you, Slim?
- Never do.

291
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,734
Friend.

292
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,436
Come on.

293
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,271
Nobody going to hurt you.

294
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,916
Prettier than the last
one, isn't she, Major?

295
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,783
Does she know she's got
to stay here for a while?

296
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,914
Wouldn't be easy getting
in and out of the fort.

297
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,619
She knows. She even
kind of liked the idea.

298
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,190
All right, get out.

299
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:00,859
Yes, sir.

300
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,590
Let's leave the Major to
talk to the Indian, all right?

301
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,932
You might even find out some information
on what's going on, on the outside.

302
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,167
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

303
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,844
<i>- The years have treated you kindly,
 señora.  - Thank you.</i>

304
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,674
I thought you might have forgotten me.

305
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,276
No.

306
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,210
I could never forget you.

307
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:57,647
Did you want to?

308
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,714
<i>I think, if you remember
rightly, I was forced to, señora.</i>

309
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,259
You blame me.

310
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,724
No, I don't blame you.

311
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,163
You were brought up to
do what you were told...

312
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:12,329
<i>and you were told a common gringo Chuka
boy couldn't come up to your level.</i>

313
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,262
You've become quite hard.

314
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:20,708
<i>Since I didn't measure up to
your standard in life, Madama...</i>

315
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,208
I had to find a way to
bring people down to mine.

316
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,842
<i>With your gun, I hear, Señor Chuka.</i>

317
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,213
<i>With my gun, Señora Kleitz.</i>

318
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,384
<i>Señora Kleitz.</i>

319
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,127
You are a vision.

320
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,766
May I have the honor of
escorting you to dinner?

321
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,170
Thank you.

322
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,078
<i>Señor Chuka.</i>

323
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,946
<i>I saw you from the window, when
you said good evening to the Señora.</i>

324
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,509
Now you can say good evening to me.

325
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,455
<i>All right. Good evening, señorita.</i>

326
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,353
Perhaps you will escort
me to the Officers' Mess?

327
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,419
<i>I've never had a pistolero
take me to dinner.</i>

328
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:17,230
<i>Tell me, señor, are
you as bad as they say?</i>

329
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,232
<i>No man is as bad as
they say, señorita.</i>

330
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,904
When we saw you this
morning, where were you going?

331
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,204
Montana.

332
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,203
To kill someone?

333
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:34,384
Señora should've taught you that a little
girl doesn't ask a man so many questions.

334
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,386
<i>The Señora has taught me.</i>

335
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,048
- It's just that I never learn.
- I see.

336
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,384
So I had to take a
detail, a full detail...

337
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,226
to retrieve the lady's
clothing from the Indians.

338
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,628
Major, I suspect you've
been straying from the truth.

339
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,136
<i>Señora, I swear, the gospel truth.</i>

340
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:54,798
<i>Señora.</i>

341
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,936
I daresay that one
night, in years to come...

342
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:05,274
you will remember another strange
night on the American desert...

343
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,784
when you dined at Fort Clendennon.

344
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,978
We will indeed remember it, Colonel.

345
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,716
I truly hope so...

346
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:18,060
because a pleasant evening like
this takes one away from reality.

347
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,954
<i>- Reality?
- Yes, señora.</i>

348
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,161
Reality.

349
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,627
Examine my executive officer...

350
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:31,632
our immensely charming
and witty Major Benson.

351
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,510
He's a well-known
gambler in Army circles.

352
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,014
Many men I know gamble.

353
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,606
<i>Yes, señora...</i>

354
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:43,719
but not quite with
Major Benson's style.

355
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,588
You see, when the Major deals...

356
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,627
cards appear from his
sleeve, from his vest...

357
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,822
from the bottom of the deck.

358
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,655
But never, I might add...

359
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,258
from the top of the deck.

360
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,596
Major Benson...

361
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,339
is a cheat.

362
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,405
<i>Your glass is empty, señora. Orderly!</i>

363
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,911
Yes, sir.

364
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,576
There's nothing so
warming to the soul...

365
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,116
as a glass of good Madeira.

366
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,781
Please allow me.

367
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,585
Indeed, allow our
good doctor the honor.

368
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,160
- Dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

369
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,698
Who is only incidentally, a doctor.

370
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,428
By profession...

371
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,939
he's a coward...

372
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,304
I protest!

373
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:41,209
...who let 36 men die as he slept.

374
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,176
<i>Isn't it fascinating, señora,
what a uniform can conceal?</i>

375
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,550
Please.

376
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:53,746
It becomes even more
fascinating. Sit down, Lieutenant!

377
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,129
<i>What a charming dress, señorita.</i>

378
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,388
Charming dress.

379
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,061
It's the most beautiful color.

380
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,995
Paris, I presume?

381
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:10,301
Lieutenant Daly.

382
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:15,539
Treason.

383
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:20,909
Can you imagine, ladies? Treason.

384
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,448
- Colonel, I resent your remarks.
- Resent?

385
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,457
I merely state the record, Lieutenant.

386
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,458
<i>Señorita, a little sweet liqueur?</i>

387
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,364
I still have a bottle from London.

388
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,991
I was acquitted.

389
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:40,504
They were all court-martialed
and acquitted, of course.

390
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:44,502
- Sir, permission to be excused.
- Permission denied, Captain.

391
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,938
Perhaps you would like to...

392
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,676
tell our guests how you could sleep...

393
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:56,478
as your command was being wiped out.

394
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,315
I hadn't had any sleep in four days.

395
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:07,258
We were hemmed in by the Sioux.
My eyelids felt like lead, and I...

396
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,195
Do go on, Captain.

397
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:14,534
Damn you! It happened just
the way I'm telling you.

398
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,441
Very impressive outburst, Captain.

399
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,603
There's nothing sleepy
about you now, is there?

400
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,476
Sit down!

401
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,248
<i>- I really think...
- Please, señora, please.</i>

402
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,452
You will miss the
climax of our evening.

403
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,394
<i>Our pièce de résistance.</i>

404
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,830
And now to hear from
our other guest...

405
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,425
our gunfighter.

406
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,003
Major, more brandy for Mr. Chuka.

407
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,299
Now, tell me, Mr. Chuka...

408
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,701
how many men...

409
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,938
have you killed?

410
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,650
<i>- I really think it's time...
- Please, señora, please.</i>

411
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:05,212
<i>It is merely dessous des cartes.
Another sip of Madeira and listen.</i>

412
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,779
So sorry, Mr. Chuka.

413
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:10,793
<i>Dessous des cartes means
"a peek beneath the cards."</i>

414
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,026
In French, of course.

415
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,602
I'm so sorry, Colonel.

416
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,606
That means, "peek as much as
you like. I couldn't care less."

417
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,539
In Arapaho, of course.

418
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,337
Very kind of you, Mr. Chuka.

419
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:33,143
Well then, how many
men have you killed?

420
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,613
I stopped counting at 16.

421
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,150
Were they fair fights?

422
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,128
Mr. Chuka!

423
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:53,633
- I said, were they fair fights?
- Fifteen were fair.

424
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:59,534
And what is fair to you, Mr. Chuka?

425
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,679
They were facing me.
They had a chance at me.

426
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,081
And the sixteenth?

427
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,142
I shot him in the back of the head.

428
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,884
But like the doctor here, I can't
prove he stuck a knife in me...

429
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,424
and was stealing my horse.

430
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,960
So if I'd been part of
your little army, Colonel...

431
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,519
they'd have court-martialed
me, too, wouldn't they?

432
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:22,065
I'm very happy you
say that, Mr. Chuka.

433
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,528
What about our colonel, here?

434
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,327
What has he...

435
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,035
- We could've captured them.
- And do what, make them talk?

436
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:03,000
Look at that! That's
an Arapaho dog soldier.

437
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,134
You could tear his heart
out, he'd tell you nothing.

438
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,804
- Sergeant, search the post.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,311
All right, Hannagan. Let's
get them up out of there.

440
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,216
On the double! What
are you men looking at?

441
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,251
You're very proficient
at it, aren't you?

442
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,586
But your time will come, too.

443
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,255
And you'll be just
as dead as this one.

444
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,524
Maybe you before me, Colonel.

445
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:32,128
You're a lucky man. The arrow
wasn't meant for Captain Carrol.

446
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,564
Meaning it was meant for me?

447
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,531
You must be very
disappointed, Mr. Chuka.

448
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:42,238
You drew a lot of blood in there,
Colonel, from men who were your officers.

449
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,712
You sure they're guilty?

450
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:47,615
If there were any doubt, they
would not be at Fort Clendennon.

451
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,444
That sets me to thinking.

452
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,926
What the hell are you doing
here? What's your guilt?

453
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,763
What are you standing around for? Come
on, check that kitchen in there, too.

454
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,201
Hold it, gunfighter.

455
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,467
You may pull a fast gun...

456
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:18,309
but as far as I'm concerned,
you still sleep in the stable.

457
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:22,780
When you speak to the Colonel,
you keep a respectable mouth.

458
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:26,914
He's the commanding officer of
this post, and don't you forget it.

459
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:06,157
Horse without a rider. Open the gates.

460
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,836
Colonel, that's Lou
Trent's horse, sir.

461
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,245
That old beaver would
never lose a horse.

462
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,810
No. I don't think he would.

463
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,049
Look at that, Jake.

464
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:37,321
That's off an Arapaho war bridle,
Colonel. He didn't lose his horse.

465
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,419
They sent it back to you.

466
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,675
With Hanu patrolling our perimeter, we
have to face the reality of the position.

467
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:57,236
I can get neither word
out nor reinforcements in.

468
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:01,273
Now, you're both
experienced with Arapahos...

469
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,378
and sufficiently skilled
to scout in this region.

470
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:08,050
You will each take one trooper
and go into this area here.

471
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:13,453
Penetrate as far as you can for one
hour and then report back to the fort.

472
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,500
I want to know the size and
location of the hostiles...

473
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,831
and their state or
readiness to attack.

474
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,234
Colonel...

475
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,166
this is your fight, not mine.

476
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,205
Mr. Chuka.

477
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,967
Look, I'm not going to ride for you.

478
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:30,273
That's not for you to decide.

479
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:32,076
Like hell it ain't.

480
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,547
I am in command here.

481
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:38,413
I'll just hang back and
protect the women. With you.

482
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,760
You're under arrest.
Major Benson, disarm...

483
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,954
No. He wouldn't do
anything foolish like that.

484
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,759
- Major!
- Don't move!

485
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,527
Don't think.

486
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,231
Just ease off.

487
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:02,173
Colonel, I said I
wouldn't ride for you.

488
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,180
As long as you are on this
post, you will do as I say.

489
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,515
You're exactly right, so
I'll just be on my way.

490
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,986
No one leaves this fort.

491
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,888
I'm going down to the stable,
I'm going to get my horse...

492
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,256
and ride out of here
just like I came in.

493
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:19,592
And I'll kill the first
man who tries to stop me...

494
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:22,894
and I'll get an even half
dozen before you get me.

495
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,794
Now listen to me.

496
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,470
I'll kill him.

497
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:41,408
Now tell him to move, Colonel.

498
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,520
All right, Sergeant.

499
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,578
Chuka.

500
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,184
- You better let me do that.
- I can saddle my own horse.

501
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:22,384
I know, but you'll need both hands
because you got trouble coming.

502
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:25,257
- What are you talking about?
- Big trouble.

503
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,168
Thanks, Jake.

504
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:41,236
- What's this, a farewell delegation?
- Mister...

505
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:44,905
I warned you about being
respectful to the Colonel...

506
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:48,179
but that last bit in his
office just finished it.

507
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,345
Now, these men are my witnesses.

508
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,084
Unarmed, right?

509
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,649
What the hell is this tin-pot Colonel
to you? You got to wet-nurse him?

510
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:57,887
He's...

511
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,893
He's my commanding officer,
and I don't forget it.

512
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:07,092
Now you can pull that gun of
yours and shoot me where I stand...

513
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,805
or defend yourself as best you can...

514
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:13,502
'cause I intend to beat you
into the ground with my fists.

515
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,473
I'm waiting on you.

516
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:19,880
I wouldn't want to keep a busy
man like you waiting, Sergeant.

517
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,779
- Watch the rest of them, Jake.
- Right.

518
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:36,073
I just saw the sergeant spit out
a little bitty piece of tooth.

519
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:38,478
I guess that makes you the winner?

520
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,511
Give me that, Jake.

521
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,894
Is there something I can do?

522
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:05,399
No, I think I've had just
about everything done for me...

523
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:08,467
that could be done the
last couple of minutes.

524
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,121
<i>Señora, tell me.</i>

525
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:25,619
Yes.

526
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,897
That man you married...

527
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,691
did you love him?

528
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,173
- He was a decent person.
- And highborn and rich.

529
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:42,702
Were you in love with him?

530
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,303
No.

531
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,949
I was very unhappy
when you were sent away.

532
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,421
For yourself?

533
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:57,720
For us.

534
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,000
<i>Señora, I'm going to leave
the fort. I'm not coming back.</i>

535
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,308
<i>I think you and the little
señorita should come with me.</i>

536
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:14,708
- Now?
- Now.

537
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,301
Hanu's fighting for survival.

538
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,406
He wants what's in this fort.
The Colonel won't give it to him.

539
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,610
- What should the Colonel do?
- Get everybody out.

540
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:25,177
Leave the buildings, the ammunition,
the food, everything, to the Indians.

541
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:28,156
But that would mean treason
for an officer like the Colonel.

542
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,750
And I'm sure he feels that
we're safer inside the walls.

543
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:34,627
You go along with that, the
authority? The same as years ago, huh?

544
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,833
<i>Señora, there may
not be another chance.</i>

545
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,207
Mr. Chuka.

546
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,804
<i>I'm sorry to interrupt
you. Excuse me, señora.</i>

547
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:58,286
Sergeant Hahnsbach says that you
might scout for us if we paid you.

548
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:02,116
I said that one man might get
past those Arapahos out there...

549
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:05,218
if he's fast enough
with a horse and a gun.

550
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:09,331
All right, I like to be asked.

551
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,759
I'm asking you.

552
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,434
$200.

553
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:21,800
Your pound of flesh will be
waiting for you when you return.

554
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:23,846
Now. Cash on the barrel.

555
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,608
My office in five minutes.

556
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:38,753
We require the signing of a pay
voucher by any civilian employee.

557
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:42,896
If you can't write, just
make your mark. Regulations.

558
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:47,498
- By the book, Colonel?
- Yes, by the book.

559
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:50,272
By the way...

560
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:54,241
- what was that all about?
- What was what all about?

561
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,306
You and Hahnsbach.

562
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,773
Nothing in particular.

563
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:05,016
I gathered as much from the Sergeant.

564
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:21,668
Chuka, the sights are honest.

565
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:25,808
She'll kick like a mule till you
get used to the extra power...

566
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,468
but she'll put it where you want it.

567
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:31,071
I'll leave that cannon to the expert,
Jake. I'll stick with this one.

568
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,638
Mr. Chuka?

569
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,314
Yeah, Mr. Hahnsbach.

570
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:40,149
Good luck.

571
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,356
Open her up.

572
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,925
<i>You're loco.</i>

573
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,167
You're a dead man right now.

574
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:44,434
Shut up. Keep down, just keep down.

575
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,907
You got a long way to crawl.

576
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:48,539
Keep down.

577
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,908
My legs. You better get
out of here while you can.

578
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:56,440
Go on. I got a horse tethered
on the other side of them rocks.

579
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,652
There's one hell of a
lot of them down there.

580
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,858
Yeah, one hell of a lot
of them down there, too.

581
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:11,057
How long you figure before
he's gonna hit the fort?

582
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:13,857
This Hanu, he's some
different kind of Indian.

583
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,223
I think he's through training for war.

584
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,824
I think he'll seal off the
fort in a handful of hours.

585
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:22,133
- He will, will he? Let's get going.
- Why you going back to the fort?

586
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,730
The Colonel paid me just
like he paid you. Come on.

587
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:28,744
<i>Who is it? Who is it
taking you back? The Señora?</i>

588
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:32,370
You got a big mouth for an old
man. Come on, can you make it?

589
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,247
I said I was a little lame, I
didn't say I couldn't make it.

590
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:36,683
You're still tough, too.

591
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:51,759
So just see that that's
done, Major, will you?

592
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,063
Yes, Colonel.

593
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:58,503
Major Benson.

594
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:03,478
I'd like to talk to you for
a minute if I could, sir.

595
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,047
What is it, Spivey?

596
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:10,315
I was just wondering what
you think Hanu's gonna do.

597
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:13,718
You wanted to talk to me to ask
a ridiculous question like that?

598
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,951
Wait a minute.

599
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:20,018
You know you're talking to the boy that
knows that you're no officer and gentleman.

600
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:21,859
You had your money, now shut up.

601
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:26,027
Me and Clyde and Badger have been
working on them barrack bums back there...

602
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,332
- and you wanna know something?
- What?

603
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:32,530
Any one of them, anybody over there...

604
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:35,908
would cut the old Colonel's
throat, just for a chaw of tobacco.

605
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,209
What does that mean?

606
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,040
Well, it means that...

607
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,184
we've kind of been figuring
on taking over the fort here...

608
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,484
lock, stock and whiskey barrel.

609
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,952
That's crazy.

610
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:52,090
No, we just wanna stop all
them poor troopers over there...

611
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:56,495
from being slaughtered by them Arapahos,
that's all. Including ourselves, right?

612
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,661
Promote you to colonel.

613
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:03,698
You can lead us right on out of here,
right down that Glory Road to freedom.

614
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:05,172
Now, how about it?

615
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:07,906
You realize that's mutiny, don't you?

616
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,947
You call it whatever you
want, but you're gonna do it.

617
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:15,978
'Cause if I decide to whisper
into the Colonel's ear...

618
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:20,011
that one of his lily-white officers has
been rolling in the hay with Pocahontas...

619
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:23,320
you're gonna face another
court-martial for damn sure.

620
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,228
You can't afford to
do that now, can you?

621
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:28,627
Especially the way he hates your guts.

622
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,797
Almost as much as you hate his, right?

623
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,563
All right, I'll do it.

624
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,530
But I'm in command.

625
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:41,303
That's fine. That's what
I said, you're the Colonel.

626
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:44,073
All soldiers need somebody
to lead them, anyway.

627
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:49,348
Now you think you can talk Lieutenant
Daly into going along with you?

628
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,553
Maybe. We'll see.

629
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:54,021
All right, you see. But
don't make us wait too long.

630
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,489
Now don't rush me.

631
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,392
I'm gonna do this in
a military fashion.

632
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:02,192
You're gonna do a mutiny
in a military fashion?

633
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:07,195
All right, you do it any way you
want, I don't care, let's just do it.

634
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:15,669
- Sergeant!
- Yes!

635
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:17,770
Two riders, Trent and the gunfighter.

636
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,509
Well, don't just stand
there, open up! Open up!

637
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:38,056
Easy, easy.

638
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,034
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

639
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,196
- In my office.
- Yes, sir.

640
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:44,136
All right.

641
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:06,957
Anything else?

642
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:09,287
There's plenty else.

643
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,767
Hanu was practicing
to attack this post...

644
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:16,532
and he's got tricks up his sleeve
like you wouldn't believe for you.

645
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:20,167
And his dog soldiers are the
best disciplined I've ever seen.

646
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,837
And you ain't got much time, Colonel.

647
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,778
Any chance of cutting our way through?

648
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,345
None.

649
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:36,216
- A rider to Fort Wallace for help?
- No, wouldn't get past the first ridge.

650
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:43,760
You better come up with some
tricks of your own, and fast.

651
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,927
I am forced to remind you
once again, Mr. Chuka...

652
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,597
that I am still in
command of this fort!

653
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:54,166
And I'm forced to remind you, Colonel,
that you're not in command of a fort.

654
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:57,974
You're in command of a
bunch of cavalry foul-ups...

655
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:01,514
and unless you take action, you
got a massacre on your hands.

656
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:05,746
Sergeant.

657
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,786
- Sir.
- Yes, Major?

658
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:13,089
The men are assembled outside.
They wish to speak to you.

659
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:14,686
It's urgent, Colonel.

660
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:23,332
What do you figure that's all about?

661
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:31,638
Attention!

662
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,506
Never mind, Sergeant.

663
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,480
I'm taking over command.

664
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,881
We're not gonna wait
here and get slaughtered.

665
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:41,218
Major Benson...

666
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:44,316
- you will place yourself under arrest.
- I'm taking over command!

667
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:47,089
I said you will place
yourself under arrest.

668
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:48,255
Colonel.

669
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:55,462
Colonel, you might be able to buffalo
these candy-striped officers of yours...

670
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:56,664
but not me.

671
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,638
Spivey, get back in your ranks.

672
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,734
Hanu's coming, Colonel, and
we're getting out of here.

673
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:11,784
Now listen to me.
Listen to me, all of you.

674
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:16,988
You're here at Fort Clendennon
because of some mistake in your past.

675
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:22,495
But whatever you've done before won't
come close to what you're about to do now.

676
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:25,998
We've heard all that before.
I said we're getting out.

677
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:30,869
Now, you can leave, you can run,
but you'll have to kill me first.

678
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:35,338
You are soldiers in
the United States Army!

679
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:38,346
We're the scum of the United
States Army, Colonel...

680
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,678
and so are you, you gutless limey!

681
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:54,452
Well, now I think you
better listen to me.

682
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,757
And you listen and listen good.

683
01:03:57,133 --> 01:04:00,261
I couldn't care less who
you pick as your top dog.

684
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:04,094
But Trent and me saw the whole
of the Arapaho nation out there.

685
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,233
Now unless you stick together
and stop killing each other off...

686
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,210
none of us have got a chance!

687
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:14,810
Attention.

688
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,511
I said, attention!

689
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:21,356
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

690
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,088
Place Major Benson under arrest.

691
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:28,722
Look, I just got through telling
you, you need every man you got.

692
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:36,531
Every man will go to
his post. On the double!

693
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:43,741
- Major Benson.
- Colonel.

694
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:47,677
- Write out a full report and sign it.
- Yes, sir.

695
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:00,886
Did you ever do that before?

696
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:07,125
No, never.

697
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:10,862
Tough the first time, ain't it?

698
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,109
- Corporal Hannagan.
- Yes, sir.

699
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:18,312
Burial detail.

700
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:48,368
<i>Señor Chuka, may I
speak to you a moment?</i>

701
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:50,136
Of course.

702
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:53,339
I want to tell you how sorry I am...

703
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:56,579
that I didn't let you take
us with you when you offered.

704
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:03,487
You see, I have a great
responsibility toward Helena.

705
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:07,124
She's very young and all
of her life ahead of her.

706
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:13,392
I feel you are the only one who
could make it out of here alive.

707
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,272
<i>- Señora, I don't...
- Please, let me finish.</i>

708
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:21,468
Before it's too late, could
you take Helena with you?

709
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,637
<i>Señora, I think it is too late.</i>

710
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:30,780
And if it were possible to take
one person with me, it would be you.

711
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:36,923
If it's too late,
why did you come back?

712
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,219
The money.

713
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:44,558
I see.

714
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,868
No, you don't see.

715
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:53,304
The money meant I wouldn't
have to go to Montana.

716
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:58,937
I thought perhaps I could persuade
you to let me escort you to California.

717
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:05,110
I thought, perhaps, I could
find a way to make myself...

718
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,158
presentable to you.

719
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:16,355
As you said yourself, Mr.
Chuka, now it's too late.

720
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:42,853
<i>Thank you, señora, for
thinking only of me.</i>

721
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:45,821
But how could you be so cold to him?

722
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,887
- He was only trying to tell...
- I do not wish to discuss it.

723
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:50,659
Why are you so offended?

724
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:54,332
<i>Because you know a pistolero
is in love with you?</i>

725
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:58,631
I envy you. I only wish
he felt that way about me.

726
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:01,271
I would know what to do.

727
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:05,202
<i>Go to him, señora.</i>

728
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:10,351
It cannot be.

729
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,236
What exactly you got there, Mr. Trent?

730
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:42,784
Just a little something I got
stashed away for a rainy day.

731
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:44,649
Well, it ain't raining yet.

732
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,080
It will.

733
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:50,187
Just what exactly is that, Mr.
Trent? Is that whiskey or gin?

734
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,227
Tequila. You want a drop?

735
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:08,099
Hey, I said a rainy day, not a flood.

736
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:12,102
Good.

737
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:14,144
You sure you've had enough?

738
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,013
It's good. Thank you.

739
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:26,556
Hey, you know...

740
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,959
<i>an old pistolero got me
started on this stuff.</i>

741
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:34,135
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

742
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:44,069
What the hell's going on here?

743
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:45,975
Scout patrol's returning!

744
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,818
Open the gates!

745
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:58,524
Damn it, I said open
those gates! Colonel!

746
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:01,152
Colonel Valois!

747
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:03,789
The patrol's returning, sir!

748
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,188
What the hell is wrong with
you? Those were our men.

749
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,424
Turn them over and take a good look.

750
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:58,851
How did you know?

751
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:03,149
Last time I saw your scout patrol,
Hanu was using them for target practice.

752
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:04,857
Sorry, Sergeant.

753
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:19,902
Hannagan!

754
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,075
Get rid of them.

755
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:39,490
Well, I told you that Hanu
was a different kind of Indian.

756
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:41,388
He's fancy.

757
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:45,961
Yeah, but the real thing will
come in the black of night, Chuka.

758
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,793
Just like we don't expect, Lou.

759
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,898
Can I have another little...

760
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:54,373
Oh, sure.

761
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:55,702
Thank you.

762
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:02,277
Before we was interrupted, I was telling
you how I got started on that stuff.

763
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,709
 Tequila.
- Yeah.

764
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:06,516
<i>A pistolero down in Mexico
got me started on it.</i>

765
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:11,084
And he was always bragging
to me about a kid...

766
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:16,454
that he'd learned everything he knew
about guns to, and he knew a heap.

767
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:21,097
Kid always worked around chuck
wagons, so they called him Chuka.

768
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,134
Well, what do you know.

769
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:27,672
<i>Well, the pistolero
vamoosed from Mexico...</i>

770
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:31,144
left the kid there and that
spring the kid went on the prod...

771
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:32,544
nobody knew why.

772
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:36,077
If you want somebody killed,
and the price is right...

773
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:39,882
you just call on that kid
and he'd do her. Chuka.

774
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:44,487
Oh, you got a big mouth
for an old man, Lou.

775
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,287
Brings back tender memories, huh?

776
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,326
Yeah.

777
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,838
I guess that's just
the way it had to be.

778
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:13,813
You're making a hell of a lot of
noise with that cannon of yours.

779
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:17,216
- What's going on out there?
- Nothing.

780
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:23,329
That old jaybird Hanu's showing
us nothing but tail feathers.

781
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:25,990
The real attack's gonna come later.

782
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:29,169
- How many of them are there?
- About 20.

783
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:32,506
Are the boys in blue hitting anything?

784
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,508
Yeah. Horses mostly.

785
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,271
It figures.

786
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:39,041
That's one thing I hate
about fighting Indians.

787
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:42,081
The horses killed.

788
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:47,046
- Horses?
- I love horses.

789
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:52,289
Yeah, war scares them.

790
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:55,053
Aggravates the hell out of them.

791
01:13:58,066 --> 01:14:00,034
I wanna get drunk.

792
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:08,937
I'm gonna lie down right here, get
drunk, and I'm gonna sleep it off.

793
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:13,975
Yeah, what is it?

794
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:16,745
You got an extra bottle
of that there tequila?

795
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:18,915
Well, has a dog got fleas?

796
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:20,480
Well...

797
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:24,382
I don't know what I'm
saving it for, anyway.

798
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:38,563
Wake me up when it's time to die.

799
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:41,938
You scared of dying, Lou?

800
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:46,378
Not particularly. It just
comes at an inconvenient time.

801
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,497
Sarge!

802
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:10,964
Trouble.

803
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:25,982
Colonel...

804
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:28,714
we're sealed off, sir.

805
01:15:58,453 --> 01:15:59,977
I got to talk to you.

806
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:05,288
You are obviously quite drunk, Mr.
Chuka, but there's no need to apologize.

807
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,157
I was just having a
little drink myself.

808
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:11,188
I've been drinking for a different
reason, and I've come here for an answer.

809
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:13,200
You've got to make a decision.

810
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:15,828
You gotta get everybody
the hell out of here!

811
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:21,232
And just how the hell would
you suggest I go about that?

812
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:24,211
Make a show you're moving out.

813
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:27,815
Mount up and leave,
peaceful and orderly.

814
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:30,681
And leave what Hanu
wants, food and ammunition.

815
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:35,987
Have a glass of cognac with me, Mr.
Chuka, and don't butt into Army affairs...

816
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:38,185
except, of course, when I pay you.

817
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:43,854
And if my memory serves me correctly,
you were off salary a few hours ago.

818
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:46,833
Listen, I'm gonna convince you...

819
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:50,127
you've got to get out of here!

820
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:54,275
- You know, you do intrigue me,
 Mr. Chuka.  - What?

821
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:57,410
You're so proficient.

822
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:01,746
A fine specimen of the jungle animal!

823
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:05,610
What are you wandering on about?

824
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:09,319
You got a fort full of trouble.
You've got Hanu out there.

825
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:11,253
You've lost six men dead already!

826
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,453
I've seen too many dead men!

827
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:20,749
This place will stink of death tomorrow,
and there is absolutely nothing...

828
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:22,033
... I can do about it.

829
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:24,331
By the book, Mr. Chuka.

830
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:28,499
We will stand and fight and the
outcome is in the hands of God Almighty.

831
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:29,874
By the book?

832
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:33,876
You got a doomed fort and
you still go by the book?

833
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:36,312
And what about the women?

834
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:42,956
There's the point,
Mr. Chuka, the women.

835
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,585
Or rather, should I say...

836
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:50,626
the woman.

837
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:56,303
You have a great need for each other?

838
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:00,002
And I envy you.

839
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:02,743
I envy you more than you know.

840
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:07,644
You're a hell of a lot
drunker than I am, Valois.

841
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:11,745
You asked me once why I'm here.

842
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:15,249
What was my guilt.

843
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:19,124
This is my guilt.

844
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:25,256
The last time I was in
a position like this...

845
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:30,434
while my men fought, I lay dead drunk.

846
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:34,974
I was cashiered from
the British Army...

847
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:37,943
branded a coward.

848
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:48,245
Well, I was young, stupid, but
I don't think I was a coward.

849
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:52,622
And in a few hours...

850
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:56,263
I'm going to find out.

851
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:59,625
Find out some other time.

852
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:02,793
These people don't have to die.

853
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,099
We got to get these women out!

854
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:07,642
I do understand, Mr. Chuka.

855
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,572
You're in love with her, aren't you?

856
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:17,008
I said you're in love
with her, aren't you?

857
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:20,815
All right...

858
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:23,080
I'm in love with her.

859
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:30,688
Then you'll just have to saddle up...

860
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:33,526
<i>and take your señora out of here.</i>

861
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:36,469
Because you know damn well
we wouldn't get through.

862
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,007
Hanu would think we were bringing
the Army from Fort Wallace.

863
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:45,769
Then you'll just have to stay
and fight with us, Chuka...

864
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:48,742
<i>and protect your
señora as best you can.</i>

865
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:52,747
But you can't win!

866
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:56,246
I think I can.

867
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:02,421
I'm sorry we couldn't have
talked longer. You do intrigue me.

868
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:05,761
Dismissed, Mr. Chuka.

869
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,833
You're mad, Valois.

870
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:15,073
You're stark raving mad.

871
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:14,778
Hannagan, it's gonna be light in a little
while. Get everybody to their posts.

872
01:24:14,849 --> 01:24:16,077
Right, Sarge.

873
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,086
You're up early.

874
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:25,451
I always get up early. I
didn't want to miss nothing.

875
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,694
We was just talking about guns, Sarge.

876
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:34,267
Talking about guns?

877
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:38,935
By the way, Baldwin...

878
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:42,539
how high does that cannon
of yours rise on a shot?

879
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:45,973
Only about an inch to 30 yards.

880
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:48,911
Interesting.

881
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,512
- Hey, Sarge.
- Yeah?

882
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:56,350
It ain't like you to be socializing.

883
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:01,617
You're a pretty good cook,
Slim, and I don't bother you.

884
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:04,629
You do your job, and
I'll be doing mine.

885
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:07,025
Yes, sir.

886
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:14,905
Morning.

887
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:17,511
Well! Somebody else up early.

888
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:20,810
Want some nourishment? Give
him some nourishment, Slim.

889
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:23,807
Don't give me that big
mouth this morning, Lou.

890
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:28,116
- I'm just nervous, like the rest of you.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

891
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:32,455
We was just sitting around slugging
coffee, Chuka, and talking about guns.

892
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:35,886
Yeah, Chuka. Why don't
you sit down and talk?

893
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:47,173
I know you gotta deliver that extra
coffee, but I thought maybe we'd chew the...

894
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:49,002
Now, hold it.

895
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:52,008
I ain't interfering,
and I ain't being nasty.

896
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:54,345
Matter of fact...

897
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:58,716
I'd just like to ask a question
that's been kind of bothering me.

898
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:03,390
Just how fast can you
move that weapon of yours?

899
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:08,889
You put tequila in the
Sergeant's coffee, Lou?

900
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:10,394
No.

901
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:13,193
No, I'd like to know. Just how fast?

902
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:15,893
Quicker than you can bat an eye.

903
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:17,738
That's pretty fast.

904
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:19,936
Draw and hit at the same time?

905
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,875
Draw and hit at the
same time accurate.

906
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,374
Now, wait a minute, Chuka.

907
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:30,878
Look, let's just say
we're funning, huh?

908
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:35,779
Let's just see how fast you are.

909
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,288
Draw!

910
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:48,627
Bang.

911
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:53,668
You just got killed, Hahnsbach.

912
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:59,142
Yeah, but I got my question answered.

913
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,617
You know, Sarge, I want
to ask you a question.

914
01:27:04,686 --> 01:27:06,381
And I ain't being nasty, either...

915
01:27:06,454 --> 01:27:07,921
but I wanna know...

916
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:12,122
why do you keep backing
up that colonel of yours?

917
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:15,023
- Well, he is our commanding officer.
- That's not enough.

918
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:17,530
Why do you stick with that idiot?

919
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:25,633
- Don't say that.
- Why, Hahnsbach?

920
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:35,412
He's a good commander. He
knows what the Army's all about.

921
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:36,916
He's educated.

922
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:40,910
He comes from way up there,
you know, them lords and ladies.

923
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:44,481
Well, he knows.

924
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:47,855
I ain't never said anything
to anybody about this before.

925
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:52,030
I got a pretty fair idea of
what's gonna happen today.

926
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:56,666
And I got a pretty fair idea
what we're all gonna be doing.

927
01:27:57,839 --> 01:27:59,466
You listen to me, Slim.

928
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:05,268
You breathe one word of
this, of what I'm saying...

929
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:07,613
and I'll kill you.

930
01:28:23,164 --> 01:28:25,098
We were in the Sudan together.

931
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:29,399
I was just a raw recruit then.

932
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:34,136
Soldiering because that's
what I knew I wanted to do.

933
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:38,674
The Colonel, he was a captain then.

934
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:42,111
We were out on patrol...

935
01:28:43,184 --> 01:28:47,348
and I made a bad mistake...

936
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:50,786
and...

937
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:54,690
Well, anyway...

938
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:57,831
in order to save my life...

939
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:03,096
the Colonel, he got
captured by the natives.

940
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:11,278
And they worked on him
with knives, you know?

941
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:17,582
And when they finished with him...

942
01:29:23,991 --> 01:29:28,928
he wasn't a full, whole man anymore.

943
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:39,204
And he did all that to save me.

944
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:46,007
That's why I'll serve
him as long as I live.

945
01:29:56,524 --> 01:29:58,116
Now do you understand?

946
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:02,054
I understand.

947
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:16,600
Colonel?

948
01:30:18,646 --> 01:30:20,705
Sir?

949
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:32,224
Sir, the men have been
placed, and all's ready, sir.

950
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:36,094
Very good, Otto.

951
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,458
Sir?

952
01:30:41,302 --> 01:30:43,395
Will there be anything else, sir?

953
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:47,500
No thank you, Sergeant.

954
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:42,563
Is there any hope?

955
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:45,465
There's every hope in the world.

956
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:50,630
We found something I've been
searching for all my life.

957
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:53,068
I'm gonna keep it.

958
01:31:57,478 --> 01:31:58,911
Aunt Veronica.

959
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:02,906
Will you hear my
confession now, please?

960
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,187
- Hannagan.
- Yes, sir.

961
01:32:47,261 --> 01:32:49,923
Put two men up on the west wall.

962
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:13,645
Now, listen to me...

963
01:33:14,121 --> 01:33:15,850
and try and understand me.

964
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:18,415
You can get out.

965
01:33:20,661 --> 01:33:22,094
Try and understand.

966
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:26,427
You're one of them. You can get out.

967
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:23,784
Get down and get those horses out of
there! Come on, men. On the double!

968
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:26,782
Get that fire out.
Get those horses out!

969
01:37:31,712 --> 01:37:34,408
It happened too quickly, Chuka.

970
01:37:35,449 --> 01:37:37,417
I didn't have time.

971
01:37:38,552 --> 01:37:39,541
I didn't have...

972
01:38:19,593 --> 01:38:21,390
Come down here!

973
01:39:08,876 --> 01:39:10,138
Colonel.

974
01:43:05,746 --> 01:43:10,649
The owner of the gun has not been
found, nor has his body been identified.

975
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,115
In regard to the request through the
United States Secretary of State...

976
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:19,751
by his Excellency, the
Mexican Ambassador...

977
01:43:19,826 --> 01:43:24,263
for information as to the
whereabouts of the Mexican citizens...

978
01:43:24,331 --> 01:43:27,061
<i>Señora Kleitz and Señorita Chavez...</i>

979
01:43:29,002 --> 01:43:31,732
Hanu remembers two women...

980
01:43:32,272 --> 01:43:35,105
but will give no further information.

981
01:43:36,944 --> 01:43:40,243
But one thing to conclude my report:

982
01:43:41,348 --> 01:43:45,444
We found a freshly finished grave
inside the walls of the fort.

983
01:43:48,255 --> 01:43:51,691
I did not wish to assume
the responsibility...

984
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:55,026
nor commit the sacrilege
of exhumation...

985
01:43:55,929 --> 01:44:00,366
for there's a cross at its
head. It's a very small grave.

986
01:44:01,568 --> 01:44:03,092
Signed...

987
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:07,301
Captain Robert R. Foster, Fourth
Cavalry, United States Army.
