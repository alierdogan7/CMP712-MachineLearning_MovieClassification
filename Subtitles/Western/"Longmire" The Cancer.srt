169
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,666
HENRY: Mathias, I just told
Alma White Hawk...

170
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,931
...that her only grandson
was murdered.

171
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:59,001
That woman does not care about
your pissing match with the sheriff.

172
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,304
She wants to know
what happened to her boy.

173
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,507
If you cannot stand the idea
of cooperating with Walt...

174
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,413
...you think of it as helping her.

175
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:13,451
I'm trying to find a connection
between Freddy and the Mexican cartel.

176
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,084
- Now was Freddy in a gang?
- Not that I know of.

177
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,423
WALT:
What about the cartel?

178
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,088
- Are they operating on the res?
- They were.

179
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,701
- "Were"?
- Growing marijuana on res land.

180
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,302
About 10,000 plants.

181
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,769
- They were growing it here?
MATHIAS: It's good business.

182
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,432
Plant the supply next to the customer,
cut down on transportation costs.

183
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,370
- When'd you find them?
MATHIAS: A month ago.

184
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,606
Arrested five Mexican migrant workers.
Held them for a week.

185
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,012
But the feds never showed up
to take custody...

186
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,348
...because they were focused
on the border. We had to let them go.

187
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,820
You raided a Mexican cartel grow,
never thought to let me know?

188
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:50,451
Problem's contained, sheriff.
Next time, I'll send a smoke signal.

189

WALT: This one of the
Mexicans you released? - No.

This guy, I know him.

191

Found the same one
in a tent at the grow we raided.

192
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:14,719

- Yeah. He's their patron saint.

MATHIAS:
You wanna hear my theory, sheriff?

194
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,726
Cartels use scouts
to find the best place to hide a grow.

195
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,522
Freddy must have been theirs.

196
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,861
After we raided the grow,
cartel got angry at Freddy, killed him.

to Denver and she seemed good.

Why are you asking me
in the past tense?

215
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,271
Oh, no. Was he the Cheyenne kid
they pulled out of the river?

216
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:50,609
- Not they. Me. So you know him?
- Yeah.

217
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,444

00:15:55,621 --> 00:16:00,251

- I was just making sure. Yeah.

220
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,486
For the last eight or nine months,
I got everything from Freddy.

221
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:07,496
He was like Weedmart.
He was making some serious coin too.

222
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,033
I don't know where he was getting
his stuff, but it was nice.

223
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:18,200
It was, like, a relaxed body buzz with an
energetic, yet slightly racy head high.

00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,461
Did Freddy ever mention
any Mexican names?

00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:46,002
Yeah, he talked a couple times
on the phone to a guy...

233
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,139
...some dude he called El Lupo.

...how did we miss that?

00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,587
We didn't miss it.

243
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:43,160
It's not the sheriff's fault
that the tribal police didn't tell him.

244
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,087
Maybe not.

all that Jesus Malverde stuff.

into the Mexicans if it weren't for that.

00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,946
I got my tribe. That's my gang.

259
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,820
And the only gang Freddy White Hawk
was in was, like, National Honor Society.

260
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,551
Freddy was a major pot dealer.
He was printing money.

you guys wouldn't like that.

anything to you?

00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,949
Yeah. It's Mexican for wolf.

00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:18,121
Actually, it's Italian.

Next time, pull from the back.
It's colder.

Mathias used gang members
to raid the cartel grow?

271
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,959
Kind of like what we did in Iraq.
Pay bad guys to fight even worse guys.

272
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,975
Mathias thinks the cartel
was cleaning house after his raid.

273
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,135
Punishing their scout.

274
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,282
But why would the cartel kill
one of their own guys too?

275
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:47,850
Maybe Freddy and Octavio
double-crossed the cartel somehow.

276
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,887
Cheated them out of money.
Stole product.

277
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,114
Or maybe Mathias
ran the drug trade...

278
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,123
...and the cartel was his competition.

279
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,491
That would explain why Mathias
never informed us about his raid.

280
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,155
If Freddy wasn't working
with Mathias or the gangs...

281
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,961
...he certainly worked with someone.
- El Lupo.

Who's El Lupo?

- Ms. Ambrose, can we help you?
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to interrupt.

- It's Lizzie. And I insist.

00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:21,473
Anyway, maybe we could get together
one night for a drink or dinner.

00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,835
Staging a raid
on one of your own grows.

499
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,135
Trying to throw me off.

500
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:21,639
That's smart.

501
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,746
Walt, this is crazy.
You're way out of line here.

502
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:33,221
I saw how much fertilizer
Nomar Vargas was buying...

503
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,723
...I knew there was tons more pot
in these hills.

504
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,361
So you could afford
to sacrifice one grow...

505
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,622
...to make it look like the cartel's work.

506
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:47,564
But you forgot
the Jesus Malverde statue.

507
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,132
All right.

508
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,735
All right, these grows were mine
but I didn't kill Freddy.

509
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,142
He was my friend.

510
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,283
He was my partner.
Look, he knew customers.

511
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,352
After four tours of wandering around...

512
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,580
...pot farms and poppy fields
in Kandahar...

513
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,280
...I knew how
and where to grow.

514
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,287
Then why is he dead, Eli?

515
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,054
Because Freddy underestimated
the enemy, Walt.

516
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:17,565
Look, two days ago, Freddy shows up
at one of my grows with a stranger.

517
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,363
Mexican cartel guy Freddy scouted for,
way back.

518
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,166
Freddy thought he could be a partner.

519
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,209
But this bastard...

520
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,141
No, he tries to buy our business.

521
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,940
When I say no...

522
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:34,573
...this son of a bitch
just shoots Freddy twice in the chest.

523
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,612
Figures I'm just gonna
shit my pants and sell.

524
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:43,059
Well, after being through what I had...
Well, you just react.

525
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,388
- So you killed him?
- Hell, yes.

526
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,999
There's no way that guy was leaving
there alive after executing Freddy.

527
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:57,970
You know, Walt, I was sent to war
to kill my country's enemies over there.

528
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:02,738
Now looks like I'm going to jail
for killing my country's enemies here.

530
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,023

533
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,867
The only way we get out of here
is you taking these cuffs off...

534
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,977
...and giving me my sidearm back.

535
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,137
We've gotta split up
to take them out, Walt.

536
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:58,267
I got enough regrets in my life.
Don't make me add this to the list.

538
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,569
WALT:
Don't move!

539
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:43,503
- You just gonna shoot me in the back?
- I got every right to.

540
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,232
You know
they're gonna keep coming, Walt.

541
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,771
- They're not just gonna give up.
- Neither am I.

542
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,965
Eli, drop the gun!

543
00:40:57,087 --> 00:41:00,079
Where you been, Jamie?
People were worried about you.

544
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:05,285
- I know. I was worried about me.
- We solved Freddy's murder.

545
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:09,024
- The guy who killed him is dead.
- That's what your deputy told me.

546
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,929
Branch?

547
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,363
He say anything else?

548
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,994
He wanted to know
how you and I knew each other.

549
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,505
And what'd you say?

550
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:21,611
I told him we used to play
in the same band.

551
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:40,720
"Now you owe me dinner."
Signed, "Lizzie."

552
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,636
- Who is Lizzie?
- A registered voter.

553
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,664
You see that Freddy's grandma
gets that?
