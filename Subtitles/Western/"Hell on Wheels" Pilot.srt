[Church bells ringing]

00:00:57,202 --> 00:00:59,199
What we did...

00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:05,562
Evil... unspeakable things.

6
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:07,669
You were a soldier.

7
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:11,374
You were
following orders.

8
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:16,147
No.

9
00:01:16,214 --> 00:01:18,568
No, not just orders.

10
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,998
We opened a dark door...
And the devil stepped in.

11
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,546
The only way to
cast out the devil...

12
00:01:28,606 --> 00:01:32,237
Is to confess to God.

13
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:35,407
No.

14
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:38,473
No, I can't, father.

15
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:42,611
Tell me about Meridian.

16
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,249

about Meridian?

The only question
which remains is...

25
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:38,499
Which one of you will join
me in this mad, noble quest?

26
00:03:38,557 --> 00:03:43,854
Who among you will have
to say in years hence

27
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:50,360
that he stood idly by as
this nation became an empire?

28
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:56,879
And who among you will be
able to say he lent a hand

29
00:03:56,961 --> 00:04:01,696
in making manifest our
destiny as a great nation?

30

The faster I shovel,
the faster they eat it up.

34
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:19,883
But it was a truly
inspirational speech.

35
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,906
Twattle and shy, I say.

36
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:25,721

I'm giving you the chance
to get in on the ground floor.

43
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:50,775
So, you'll be
paying yourself

44
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:54,767
to build a railroad with
government subsidies.

45
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:57,111
Now that, my friend,
is inspirational.

46
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,631
Yes, it is, but...

47
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,864
I can't afford these
on a senator's salary.

As head of the

49

I'm sure you will
find a way to pay

50
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:15,387
for them over and over
and over again.

51
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:17,636
Might I ask how many
shares are here?

52
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:19,791
200. I think you'll
find that's fair.

53
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:22,177
400 sounds fairer.

54
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:27,322
Are you trying
to renegotiate a bribe?

55
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:32,297
No. Bribe is such
a dirty word. Hmm?

56
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,011
Why don't you think
on it, doc, hmm?

to vote before the

Oh, 50,000 acres bought
on the cheap, hmm?

What would happen
to the value of that land

61
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:57,648

the railroad around it?

is that he got to heaven

by that conclusion?

his sins.

about his business,

00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:42,440
Whoa! Whoa!

181
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,989
Whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy, boy.

182
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:49,006
** There's 3 gates
in the east **

183
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:52,714
** there's 3 gates
in the west **

184
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:53,988
right here.

185
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,285
** There's 3 gates
in the north **

186
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:57,653
I love the tent.

187
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:58,972
** And there's 3 gates
in the south... **

188
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:00,275
raise the church.

189
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:02,722
In this den
of thieves,

190
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:05,902
I shall build a
house of the lord.

191
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:07,802
You putting up
a church here?

192
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:16,657
What better place to convert
the wicked, sister.

193
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:20,667
** Won't you do
this kind of favor... **

194
00:14:20,748 --> 00:14:22,253
you better keep an eye
on your flock, reverend.

195
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:24,919
We do our own share of
convertin' around here.

196
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,124
** Please tell my mother

197
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:34,462
why have you made
my roads so straight?

198
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:37,194
Are we not in a race
with the central pacific?

199
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:38,850
The central pacific?

200
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:41,507
Those imbeciles
will never make it
out of Sacramento.

201
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:45,989
They're so desperate, I hear
they're hiring chinks.

202
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:56,192
What I was thinking... was
something more like... this.

203
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,024
But we're building
over a flat land,

204
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:02,169
why wouldn't
we make it straight?

205
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:07,210
Why wouldn't we make it
straight he asks?

206
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:09,576
Take a closer look.

207
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:13,550
Uh!

208
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,251
Let me elucidate.

209
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:18,571
In case you haven't
heard, this undertaking

210
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:22,050
is being subsidized by
the enormous teat of
the federal government.

211
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:25,058
This never-ending,
money-gushing nipple

212
00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:28,334
pays me
$16,000 per mile,

213
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:32,514
yet, you build
my road straight!

214
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:34,384
[Groaning]

215
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:39,956
You're fired.
Get out.

216
00:15:41,668 --> 00:15:45,802
I said, get out.

217
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:55,283
You look like
a bright young man.

218
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,553
This land...

219
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:32,830
It's bewitching.

220
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:37,704
It hasn't changed
since Lewis and Clark
first saw it 60 years ago.

221
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:41,150
Do you ever wonder
if our work here will...

222
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:43,635
Will be the ruin
of all of this?

223
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:46,260
Progress comes
with a cost, lily.

224
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:50,454
I just think it's
so much more beautiful
without people.

225
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:52,715
Don't fool yourself.

226
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:54,151
There are plenty
of people here.

227
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:57,342
We're entering
Cheyenne territory.

228
00:16:57,344 --> 00:16:58,712
You do remember
our agreement?

229
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:01,656
You mean our agreement
to regarding

230
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:03,953
my not leaving your side
while you were ill?

231
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:05,192
[Coughs] No.

232
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:06,619
Ahem.

233
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:11,715
I mean, our agreement
that you should go back

234
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,589
to Chicago once we entered
hostile Indian territory.

235
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,103
Yes, my dear, but it was
before you took ill.

236
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,718
Yeah.

237
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,349
I believe our
second agreement
supersedes our first.

238
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,087
Oh, dear God, now you
sound like a lawyer.

239
00:17:26,094 --> 00:17:30,376
If you want me to go
to Chicago... lead the way.

240
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:34,361
I'm not leaving
without you, Robert.

241
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:36,997
Don't tempt me, lily.
I might just do it.

242
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,925
You play me for dumb.

243
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,571
Ahh, you've worked
for this for too long
to go back now.

244
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,297
We've worked at this.

245
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:53,107
This... this would
mean nothing to me

246
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:56,165
if you weren't
here to share it.

247
00:18:03,288 --> 00:18:08,173
Robert Bell, are you hiding
something in your trousers?

248
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,970
It must be all
this fresh air.

249
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:14,261
Mmm.

250
00:18:14,314 --> 00:18:16,987
Mmm. Breathe deeply.

251
00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:02,525
So, uh, how many
slaves did you own?

252
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,153
5 in all.

253
00:19:06,204 --> 00:19:08,360
I had me a small
tobacco farm.

254
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:10,637
Any women?

255
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:13,041
2.

256
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,696
You ever, uh...
Sample the goods?

257
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,234
Uh-uh.
It wasn't like that.

258
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,374
Call.

259
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:33,268
You, uh... bitter that
you had to give up your slaves?

260
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:37,484
I gave them their
freedom a year before
the war started.

261
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,490
Are you serious?

262
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:42,349
I kept them on at wages.

263
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:43,985
Ha ha.

264
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:46,699
You are an odd duck,
Bohannon.

265
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:49,088
I married a northerner.

266
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:52,046
She convinced me
of the evils of slavery.

267
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:57,348
So, you... you
released your slaves,

268
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,166
yet you still
fought in the war.

269
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:00,900
Why?

270
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,593
Honor.

271
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,417
[Chuckles]

272
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:12,259
The southerner
and his honor.

273
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:15,755
Where is your wife now?

274
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,109
She's dead.

275
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:25,607
Did the war take her?

276
00:20:30,436 --> 00:20:32,935
Something like that.

277
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:41,247
[Woman moaning]

278
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:50,571

00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:53,503
Who cares? [Chuckles]

280
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:57,116
I don't want to torment
the poor bastards

281
00:20:57,245 --> 00:20:59,588
out here alone in the
middle of nowhere.

282
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:01,984

Shh.

288

I feel this cough is going
to be the death of me.

289
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:19,632
Nonsense.

290
00:21:19,848 --> 00:21:22,250
Nonsense.

291

to die...

292

don't talk like that.
