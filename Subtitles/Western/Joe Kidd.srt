1
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,400
Got some nice breakfast
for you boys.

2
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,410
Hey, Joe!
Wake up and eat something.

3
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,170
You're gonna appear
before the judge.

4
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,250
He's stinking drunk.

5
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,190
Why you put him in here?
We don't want him.

6
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,160
Güero son of a bitch...

7
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,790
woke us up.
He don't give a damn.

8
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,600
Joe, you hear me?

9
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,130
You're gonna appear
before the judge.

10
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,770
- Bob Mitchell hit me?
- Yup.

11
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,140
- Who else?
- And some others.

12
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,150
It took three of 'em
to get you in here last night.

13
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,650
I'll be back for you.

14
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,940
Smells good, huh?

15
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,310
Güero,
you would like some?

16
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,580
You say,
"Please, Señor Naco."

17
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,020
Say it!

18
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,500
I want to remind you,

19
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,380
we're not suing
anybody yet.

20
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,280
We're here to see if any
of you have a legal claim.

21
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,290
If you do, then a suit will be filed
that you can take to court.

22
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,050
I want you to think
before you act.

23
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:33,690
I don't know whether or not
the land grants you claim to have...

24
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,430
signed by the King of Spain
or the Emperor of Mexico...

25
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,470
are gonna stand up
against the deeds and titles...

26
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,980
on file in
this courthouse.

27
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,750
I do have other
court matters to attend to,

28
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,590
so I'm gonna postpone
these hearings until tomorrow.

29
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,120
Give careful consideration
to what you're doing.

30
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,330
I advise you
to be prudent...

31
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,300
before you take
a legal action...

32
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,330
that's gonna set some
people's teeth on edge.

33
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,160
- Calvin?
- Yo.

34
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,740
Give me Joe Kidd
right now.

35
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,090
Come on, Joe.
They're waitin' on ya.

36
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,780
Hey, güero, want some?

37
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,650
Go ahead, take it.

38
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,230
! Hijole chingado!

39
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,180
You want some?

40
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,130
Calvin, what in the hell's
going on in there?

41
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,800
Nothin'. Boy just
spilled his breakfast.

42
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,010
Shouldn't have
hit me, Bob.

43
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,480
Next time, I'll knock
your damn head off.

44
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,450
Let's go see the judge.

45
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,730
Your Honor, I've got
three warrants on Joe Kidd:

46
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,890
poaching, disorderly,
and resisting arrest.

47
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,960
- You said "poaching"?
- Yes, sir.

48
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,900
A witness saw him carrying a buck
off the Jicarilla reservation.

49
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,270
You arrested a man
for shooting a deer?

50
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,470
I warned him before.
He admits killing it.

51
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,910
- What did you do with this deer?
- I ate him.

52
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,310
You know it's against the law
to hunt on reservation land?

53
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,610
The deer didn't know
where he was,

54
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,780
and I wasn't sure, either.

55
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,620
You plead guilty?

56
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,890
I'm sayin' I shot a mule deer
south of Monero.

57
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,900
That's on the reservation.

58
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,140
I told him he had to pay
a fine and he got nasty.

59
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,440
- That's the disorderly charge?
- No, sir.

60
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,420
On the disorderly, I had to
arrest him for something else.

61
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,350
What?

62
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,120
He was standing out there
and he claimed he was gonna...

63
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,820
urinate over the courthouse.

64
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,460
You do just about whatever
you feel like, is that it?

65
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,900
Anything else?

66
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,070
Yes, there is.

67
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,520
Whether you want
to pay a $10 fine...

68
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,560
or spend 10 days in jail.

69
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,890
I'll take the 10 days.

70
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,360
Your Honor?

71
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,730
This court's adjourned
until 2:00.

72
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,100
You think you're
gonna sit in that jail...

73
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,100
while Calvin waits on you?

74
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,110
You're gonna paint,
scrub floors. I'm gonna...

75
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,880
I want to warn you people you're in
a United States territorial court.

76
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,650
We have listened to you enough.

77
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,070
Now...

78
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,470
Now it is our turn.

79
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,360
When the Anglo first wished
to build a house in Sinola,

80
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,600
he asked permission.
Yes, yes.

81
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,310
The old people, our grandfathers,
say "It is all right.

82
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,780
There is enough land.
Let the Anglo have a home."

83
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,510
Then you build more houses.

84
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,150
You bring in the railroad.

85
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,120
You make the courthouse.

86
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,860
That is when we begin to
hear you say strange things.

87
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,760
Two years ago, we start to
see about our land claims.

88
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,200
We go to the record office
in Santa Fe...

89
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,950
and ask the man for the copies
of our deeds and the titles.

90
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,180
You know what he say?

91
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,450
"We don't have records
like that anymore.

92
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,460
"There was a fire.

93
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,820
All the records
got burned up."

94
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,160
If you feel you have a
legal claim and can prove it...

95
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,220
We've heard all that!

96
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,630
Ricardo.

97
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,570
We let you use our land,
but you wish to steal it all!

98
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,210
Look, mister,
whatever your name is...

99
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,720
I am Luis Chama.

100
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,790
So you're Chama?

101
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,260
I feel you're a lot more
trouble than you're worth.

102
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,270
But I'm still
gonna inform you,

103
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,070
you're committing a criminal offense
before a witness in a court of justice.

104
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,040
That is the word.

105
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,870
Justice!

106
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,210
Later we will have much
time to talk about it.

107
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,340
What are you staring at?

108
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,590
I just want to make sure I remember
your face when you come to trial.

109
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,990
I want to show you something.

110
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,610
Anglos claim
they own all the land now.

111
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,480
Big cattle
and timber companies.

112
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,980
One day,
one day there was a fire.

113
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,720
! Que viva!

114
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,960
Pon el juez en la carreta.

115
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,970
Vamonos.

116
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,370
Stay where you are!
He's going with us.

117
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,100
Talk to him about the law
and the land rights.

118
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,310
What do you want him for?
Take Mitchell.

119
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,480
Mitchell's an expert
on rights.

120
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,930
- Think they'll shoot us?
- Maybe, maybe not.

121
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,370
Luis, he's got the judge!

122
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,170
- Who's with him?
- Joe Kidd. He was in the jail.

123
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,080
I don't care about him.
Get the judge!

124
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,780
I suggest you go right
on out back, Your Honor.

125
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,220
Hello, Joe.
How'd you make out?

126
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,080
I'm not sure yet, Harry.

127
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,850
Ah, güerito,
you're thirsty, huh?

128
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,080
Where is he?

129
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,060
He went home.

130
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:57,030
Naco! Naco!

131
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,430
Your friends
are calling you.

132
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,840
Vamonos, pronto, Naco.

133
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,200
I guess I better go.

134
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,940
I guess so.

135
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,240
- Naco!
- Maybe...

136
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,780
we'll see each other
in jail again, huh?

137
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,940
That's possible.

138
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,350
- Adios.
- Adios.

139
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,650
Naco, vamonos.

140
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,000
Calvin!

141
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,160
Where in the hell
have you been?

142
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,970
They broke those
two fellas out of jail!

143
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,140
- I said, where the hell have you been?
- Locked up.

144
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,610
- Where?
- In jail.

145
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,510
Form a posse!
Get mounted! Get your guns!

146
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,570
Goddamn!

147
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,380
Cheese.

148
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,790
I'll take the posse out.
You stay here.

149
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,960
Try to keep law and order
while I'm gone.

150
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,560
- How are we gonna find him?
- He just left fresh tracks.

151
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,830
They scattered tracks
all over!

152
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,160
How're we gonna know which
ones are Luis Chama's?

153
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,310
He gets up in them mountains,
he'll be home!

154
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,780
Now just a damn minute!

155
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,190
I'm not begging you
to go with me.

156
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,590
You want to sit on
your fat asses while...

157
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,650
that wild son of a bitch
is loose, that's up to you.

158
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,750
If you don't mind him
cutting your fences, running your stock,

159
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,490
that's all right with me,
but get outta the way,

160
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,590
'cause I'm gonna bring back
him or his hair.

161
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,140
Joe, what are you doin'
standing there?

162
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,700
Hmm.

163
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,040
Serving 10 days.

164
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,950
Bob, you know Joe's
the one we need.

165
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,260
You wanna go?

166
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,790
I haven't got anything
against Luis Chama.

167
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,440
Posse couldn't get him.
You think that's gonna work?

168
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,960
Joe, you take your broom,

169
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,820
that shovel, that rake,
and that bucket.

170
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,420
Get over to courthouse square
and pick up everything...

171
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,940
that's not nailed down
or painted.

172
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,210
- Howdy, Mr. Harlan.
- Howdy.

173
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,540
- Go to the Grand Hotel.
- You betcha.

174
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,420
Whoa.

175
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,410
Good morning, Mr. Harlan.

176
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,150
These telegraph messages come in
last night and this morning,

177
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,990
one all the way from Chicago.

178
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,090
Mr. Harlan,
I want you to know...

179
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,430
what a pleasure it is to
have you and your friends.

180
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:46,370
It's been two, three months.
Seems like yesterday. Oh, my, no.

181
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,370
I'm glad you weren't
here yesterday.

182
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,500
I guess you heard about
the excitement we had.

183
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,710
I've reserved the
governor's suite for you...

184
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,340
and two other rooms.
Will that be it?

185
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,330
Mr. Harlan?

186
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,810
I want the whole second floor.

187
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,040
Oh, I've got guests
in the other rooms.

188
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,740
I mean, I don't have
extra space anywhere.

189
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,750
What am I supposed to do?

190
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,380
I can't very well tell them
to get out, can I?

191
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,560
Gimme $10 a head and
I'll throw them out the window.

192
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,930
Say the rooms are spoken for
and there's nothing you can do.

193
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,990
If they give you trouble,
give me a holler.

194
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,100
- What's wrong with saying
the rooms are spoken for?
- Send this out.

195
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,440
Hello, Mr. Harlan.

196
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,240
Ma'am.

197
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,260
Anything I can do for you?

198
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,450
I want to see a man
named Joe Kidd.

199
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,290
Joe Kidd's
locked up in jail.

200
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,520
If he weren't,
I doubt we'd be talking.

201
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,860
You knew we had him
locked up?

202
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,960
I'd like to pay the fine on him.
Send him over to me.

203
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,230
Didn't know he was
a friend of yours.

204
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,470
We'll be on
the second floor.

205
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,970
Joe, Mr. Harlan
wants to see you.

206
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,640
Who?

207
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,240
- Mr. Harlan.
- I don't know the man.

208
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,410
- Do you know his name?
- Never heard of him.

209
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,110
He knows you and
he's paid your fine.

210
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,120
- He wants to see you right now.
- Yeah? Where is he?

211
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,280
Over at the hotel.

212
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,690
- And he's paid my fine, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,700
Well, he can't be all bad.

214
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,990
- Joe Kidd?
- Yeah.

215
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,030
Be with you in a minute.

216
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,990
Hey, aren't you
gonna wait?

217
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,970
You sure don't look
like you're supposed to.

218
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,270
Just how am I
supposed to look?

219
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,540
You're all dressed
like some town dude.

220
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,550
Were you really leavin'?
Not going to wait?

221
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,420
He asked to see me, but if he's busy,
maybe some other time.

222
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,130
You don't know Mr. Harlan
very well, do you?

223
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,410
Is that what you call him?

224
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,780
Mr. Harlan?

225
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,410
I call him Frank,
and a few other things. Why?

226
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,450
Well, you...

227
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,390
don't look like his daughter,

228
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,890
and I don't think
you're his wife.

229
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,090
I'm not his mother,
either.

230
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,870
But you do take care
of him at times?

231
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,180
Ask him, if you'd like.

232
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,880
Or find out for myself?

233
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,390
How long have
they had you locked up?

234
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,020
Two days.

235
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,860
What would you be like
after two months?

236
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,360
We wouldn't even
be talking now.

237
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,160
Mr. Harlan
can see you now.

238
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,970
Mr. Harlan,
Joe Kidd.

239
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,660
Mr. Kidd.
Mr. Joe Kidd.

240
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,040
You come well recommended.

241
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,480
Judge Vince Brennan, 4th Territorial
Court, spoke very highly of you.

242
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,380
Man with the Indian bureau,
name of Wattles,

243
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,480
said you worked up at the
Jicarilla Apache station,

244
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,280
know the mountains and game trails
better than anybody.

245
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,050
You were supplying
their meat for 'em?

246
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,220
Yeah, I worked
for them a few years.

247
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,870
Before that,
I understood you hunted men,

248
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,570
anybody with
a price on his head.

249
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,610
Good at it.

250
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,610
That was a long time ago.

251
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:39,180
You got a one-loop outfit
you work when you're not out hunting.

252
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,420
I get out now and then,
yeah.

253
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,580
We propose to spend a week,
maybe 10 days.

254
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,820
Pay you whatever
your rate is.

255
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,230
A bonus for everything
we shoot worth mounting.

256
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,390
Get us some mule deer,
some elk,

257
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,960
maybe one of them
mountain cats...

258
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,270
if we see one.

259
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,500
You think
this piece of iron...

260
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,080
will stop one of them
big old cats?

261
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,490
I suppose it would,
if he lets you get close enough.

262
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,990
If you get close enough.
hear that, Mingo?

263
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,290
I'd like you to meet
my associates, Mr. Olin Mingo,

264
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,920
Lamarr Sims.

265
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,940
This is Roy Gannon.

266
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,500
These gentlemen are A-1,
first-class hunters.

267
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,440
I'd bet them against
anybody at any distance.

268
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,610
You believe that?

269
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,310
If he says so,
it's all right with me.

270
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,720
Whatever he says,

271
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,720
that's it.

272
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,430
Let me show you
something here, buddy.

273
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,310
Shut the window, Lamarr.

274
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,450
We're gonna need four horses,

275
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,990
which we'll buy off you,
if you want.

276
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,020
Come to your place tomorrow
and start in the morning.

277
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,160
You're asking me
to guide for ya?

278
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,630
What do you think
I've been talking about?

279
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,440
I don't hire out to guide.

280
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,180
Either hunting
for animals or men.

281
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,810
You don't believe
we're after mule deer?

282
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,950
You're after Luis Chama.

283
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,990
Seen through it right away.
You got a keen eye.

284
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,500
It's simple. You deal in land
and he wants to take it away.

285
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,770
If the sheriff here
can't stop him, I will.

286
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,710
I got claim to 935 sections,
nearly 600,000 acres,

287
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,220
and I'm not gonna permit some
sheepherder named Luis Chama...

288
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,410
to get away with
cutting fences...

289
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,400
and stirring up the Mexican population
with talk about land reform.

290
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,400
Nor am I gonna waste time
arguing it in court.

291
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,930
Here it is.

292
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,410
I'll give you...

293
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,500
$500 to help us
track that man.

294
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,520
If it's your shot gets him,
it's all right with me.

295
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,050
$500.
What do you say?

296
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,390
- I already said it.
- Wait a minute, sir.

297
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,790
I paid a fine,
got you out of jail.

298
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,260
If you want
your $10 back,

299
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,230
I'll serve out
the rest of the time.

300
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,860
Ah...

301
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,490
he's going on
a huntin' trip.

302
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,900
I'll be back.

303
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,320
Emilio?
Vita?

304
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,230
Joseph!

305
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,340
Se llevaron a Emilio.
Se llevaron los caballos.

306
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,010
They take him.
They take the horses, too.

307
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,240
- When did this happen?
- This morning.

308
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,280
Emilio say, "Stay home."
And they take him.

309
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,350
There. Arriba.
Up there.

310
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,320
Joseph.

311
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,840
Joseph,
where you been?

312
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,380
Did Chama do this?

313
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,710
With some of his men.

314
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,620
They take some horses
and shoot the rest.

315
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,460
The one say you kill a friend,
so he do this.

316
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,970
Say he's
gonna kill you, too.

317
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,660
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

318
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,060
Come on in.

319
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,540
You want Luis Chama?

320
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,350
Got thinkin' about the money,
did ya? Changed your mind?

321
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,410
- Do you want him?
- I told you the deal.

322
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,980
$500, and I don't care
who pulls the trigger.

323
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,690
The price will be $1,000.

324
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,900
All right.
Anything else?

325
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,800
Nope.

326
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,860
I'll meet you downstairs.

327
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,370
You want something?

328
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,840
You know how many holes
I can put in you with this gun?

329
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:25,400
Lamarr, I got a dollar says
I can break your neck...

330
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,730
before you get that rig
moved a half inch.

331
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,740
Yeah.

332
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,600
Mr. Harlan wants you around.

333
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,740
That's the only reason
I don't plug you right now.

334
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,250
When Mr. Harlan doesn't
want me around anymore,

335
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,760
you let me know, huh, boy?

336
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,140
If I was to say
my prayers, we might get lucky...

337
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,750
and find him sittin' home
waitin' on us, Mingo.

338
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,730
"How do you do, Mr. Chama?
For a dumb-ass sheep dipper,

339
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,420
"you sure been
bothering me.

340
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,930
Causin' all kinds
of discomfort."

341
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,330
There's supposed to be
a road west of here.

342
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,340
We could save some time.

343
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,460
Game doesn't
walk down roads.

344
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,630
We're supposed to be
hunting mule deer.

345
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,640
If we find somebody walking down
the road, which don't seem likely.

346
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,540
Well, we've had company now
for about a mile.

347
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:03,810
- Where at?
- Both sides of us.

348
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,580
- I don't see a goddamn thing. How many?
- Three, maybe more.

349
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,590
- What the hell's going on?
- Keep your mouth shut.

350
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,800
We got people going with us.
Maybe Chama, maybe not.

351
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,240
- I don't see anybody.
- I see 'em, Frank.

352
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,470
You bet.
Right where he said.

353
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,410
I could wing one,
if you wanted to talk to him.

354
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,350
They're not much for
staying hid, are they?

355
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,480
No, they're showing themselves,
showing they don't give a darn.

356
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,990
They know they've
got us outnumbered.

357
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,240
Buenos dias, señor.

358
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,070
Buenos dias.

359
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,210
Nice looking string
you have there.

360
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,220
Still green.
They'll be all right.

361
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,830
- You rope 'em?
- Yeah.

362
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,760
We chased them
three or four days.

363
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,930
You haven't by any chance
seen any elk, have you?

364
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,730
No. Some deer.
You out hunting, eh?

365
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,790
You haven't been home
for a while?

366
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:20,090
No, not for a few days.

367
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,150
You want some game?
Go in the San Juans.

368
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,760
Maybe you get a bear.

369
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,470
My friend, I want
to ask you a question.

370
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,670
I want to ask it
only one time.

371
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,080
Yeah?

372
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,650
Where's Luis Chama?

373
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,120
Luis Chama.
Yeah, I saw him sometime.

374
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,350
Are you looking for him?

375
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,390
Well, we gotta go.

376
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,700
If I see Luis Chama,
I'll tell him you're asking for him.

377
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,360
Vamonos.
Adios.

378
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,310
Mingo,
I want him alive.

379
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,860
I got him through the arm.

380
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:10,300
He must have jumped.
I was aiming for his shoulder.

381
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:15,700
- You say you saw Luis Chama where?
- I don't know anybody that name.

382
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:19,500
We can cut your ears off
if you want.

383
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,610
I don't know him.

384
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,710
We can cut
somethin' else off, too.

385
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,850
Dile, hombre.
? Para qué quieres que te pegue?

386
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:31,390
He says, tell you anything.
Why get chopped up?

387
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,660
Chico, the only way you're gonna stay
alive is if you answer my questions.

388
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,500
You understand that?

389
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,670
I'm asking,
where is Luis Chama?

390
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,210
I don't know him!

391
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,410
Lamarr.

392
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:56,390
I came to hunt Chama,
not kill people in cold blood.

393
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,600
I don't have time
for court hearings.

394
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,270
If these people want to fight me,
I'll blow 'em straight to hell.

395
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,120
Anybody home?

396
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,830
Hello.

397
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,300
Well, well.
Look what I have found.

398
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,250
Evenin'.

399
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,390
Honey, I want
to ask you something.

400
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,260
You know a man
name of Luis Chama?

401
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,530
I know him.

402
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,270
- You see him lately?
- No.

403
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,330
- When was the last time?
- About a week ago.

404
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,430
Are you a friend?

405
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:32,110
- I see him when he goes by here.
- On his way to Arroyo Blanco?

406
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,050
You know where that is?

407
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,980
It's over the pass.

408
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,990
- I don't think he lives there anymore.
- We're friends.

409
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,390
We just want to stop in
and say "hello."

410
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,330
Is that why you have
all those guns?

411
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,360
This is a huntin' trip,
sweetheart.

412
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,830
You gotta have guns.

413
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,340
Ask her how come
she's got so many guns!

414
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,350
They belong to my
father and brother.

415
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,790
Where are they?

416
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,320
They went to see
a man about work.

417
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,660
Leave you here by yourself,
do they?

418
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:08,790
I don't mind being alone
for a few days.

419
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,200
Pretty girl like you
shouldn't be left alone.

420
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:16,430
Maybe we ought to camp here,
if she was to invite us.

421
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,100
- What's your name, honey?
- Helen Sanchez.

422
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,470
Helen, what
would you think...

423
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,100
if we stayed out here
with you tonight?

424
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,660
I think you're going to do
whatever you want.

425
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,810
They'd like
some more coffee.

426
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,120
- Have you told them yet?
- Nope.

427
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,130
Why not?

428
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,340
I didn't figure it was
any of their business really.

429
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,340
But you are with them.

430
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,380
Let's say
I made a poor judgment,

431
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:18,350
but I'm gonna have
to live with it for a while.

432
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,720
When I was in jail there in town,
there was a man named Naco.

433
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,390
He died two days ago.

434
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,390
He shouldn't
have come at me.

435
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,190
But you want Chama,
so you joined them.

436
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,960
Everybody wants Chama.

437
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,670
He's gonna get shot or hanged.
I think he realizes that now.

438
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,110
Some people would give their
lives for what they believe.

439
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,050
Do you understand that?

440
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,990
I guess so, if they want
something bad enough.

441
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,550
No. Even if there's no chance,
but to do it for others...

442
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,360
like a soldier
gives his life.

443
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,540
You don't know Luis Chama!

444
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,440
- Maybe you never met anybody like him.
- Maybe not.

445
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,540
Were you with him
when he came by my place?

446
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,780
Yes, I was there.
You want to kill me, too?

447
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:20,380
- A man named Emilio was with my horses.
- I remember him.

448
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,040
Ramon went back to see
if he was following us.

449
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,370
Ramon, huh?

450
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,050
Next stop,
Bandera Station.

451
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,550
- Isn't anything there but stock pens.
- Wanna bet?

452
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,460
- Mr. Harlan, where you been?
- Took our time...

453
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,210
to give you a chance to rest
from your train ride.

454
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,110
We expected
you'd be here waitin'.

455
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,850
We're here now, Eljay.

456
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,450
Yes, sir. Let's go!
We're ready.

457
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,050
All those guns
to kill one man.

458
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,320
Yeah.
If they find him.

459
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,700
They're all hidin'.
Call everybody out in the street.

460
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,840
All right!
Everybody out in the street!

461
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,970
Hold your fire.
They're way up in those rocks.

462
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,580
Chama?

463
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,660
You hit one of my men,

464
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,300
I'll kill ten
of your people!

465
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,550
Good morning, Padre.
Call all your people out here.

466
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,560
We're gonna hold services
here in the street.

467
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,650
Vengan aqui todos.

468
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:20,200
Bring 'em out,
out in the street!

469
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,530
Vengan tranquilos.
Vengan todos. No tengan miedo.

470
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,630
Vengan sin miedo.
Vengan tranquilos.

471
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,240
Roy?

472
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,670
Now, then,

473
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,000
I don't want to take up
much of your time.

474
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,200
I just want to say...

475
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,410
that we're gonna shoot
five of you if Luis Chama...

476
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,110
don't come down off his mountain
by sunup tomorrow morning!

477
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:13,690
If he don't show by noon,
we shoot five more.

478
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,020
Still doesn't show up
by supper time,

479
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,510
we put five more
against that wall.

480
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,880
Now the next day, if we have to,
we'll start all over again.

481
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,920
Son.

482
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:39,590
- ? Habla usted inglés?
- Si.

483
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,150
- Do you have a horse?
- I have a horse.

484
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,670
I want you to get on your horse
and go upstairs, there,

485
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,700
and ask Luis Chama
if he heard what I said,

486
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:49,740
in case he didn't
understand me.

487
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:52,400
- ? Comprende?
- Si, señor.

488
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,880
Padre, get 'em all
inside the church.

489
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,610
Vamos a la iglesia.

490
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,290
El resto espere en la iglesia
hasta que viene...

491
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,790
o todos estan muertos,
? Comprenden?

492
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,090
Repeat the whole sermon,

493
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,600
in case any of them
American citizens...

494
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,860
don't understand English.

495
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,940
! Oigan, arriba!

496
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:19,100
Si Luis Chama no baja
de la montaña para la mañana...

497
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:22,670
vamos a matar
cinco de ustedes.

498
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:31,480
Si no viene
para mediodia,

499
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,820
mataremos
cinco mas.

500
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:39,360
Y en la tarde, lo mismo.
Mañana lo mismo.

501
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,740
? Comprenden?

502
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,120
Stake out your men, Eljay.

503
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:50,120
Put the horses down at the other end
of town. Leave the saddles on.

504
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,710
Me and the little girl
will bunk in here.

505
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,720
Kidd, you're fired.
Take his gun, Mingo.

506
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,160
Put him in the church.

507
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
Look at him.

508
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,380
Without his gun he looks
like a big, dumb farm boy.

509
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,520
Go ahead, farm boy.
Take your pick.

510
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,150
I know it's
a crappy deal, buddy,

511
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,450
but that's all you got.

512
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,800
What's the matter?
You run out of nerve?

513
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:02,140
Go ahead, grab.

514
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:05,840
'Cause I'm gonna
blow your head off.

515
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,210
I said, make a grab.

516
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,210
Aaah!

517
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,350
Jesus!
That boy don't ever learn.

518
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,790
Well, the fun's over
and he's gone to church.

519
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,620
Tenemos que rezar mucho.

520
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,050
Are you thirsty?

521
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,190
- Yeah. What do you got there?
- Holy water.

522
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:54,200
I've drunk
just about everything else.

523
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:57,100
I might as well
have some holy water.

524
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,740
Today is the feast of
St. James, the apostle,

525
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:04,500
one of the first martyrs.

526
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,670
I will tell the people,
"Pray to him,

527
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,410
for his strength
and courage."

528
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,420
St. James was beheaded
rather than deny his faith.

529
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:17,010
You wouldn't have a gun around here,
would you, Padre?

530
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:27,040
Good time of day, Eljay.

531
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:31,010
Day's work's done,
man's waiting on a good supper.

532
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,860
Open the door, Mick.

533
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:56,510
- What about these people?
Are you gonna feed them?
- Feed 'em.

534
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,020
Roy, let him get some food
for these people in here.

535
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:15,160
! Señora, señora!
Dele comida para la gente.

536
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,700
Hey, Lamarr,
how're you feelin'?

537
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,710
That medicine
easing the pain any?

538
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:30,410
You just keep talkin'.

539
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,420
You'll be spittin' teeth
all night.

540
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,610
That's a high-priced waiter
you got there, Roy.

541
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:01,250
Ha, ha, ha.

542
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,490
You gonna eat all that?

543
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,030
- It's for the glutton outside.
- Oh, yeah.

544
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,030
How's he treatin' you?

545
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,310
We're going to get married.
What the hell do you think?

546
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:22,180
You wouldn't by any chance
have a loaded gun I could use,

547
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,550
would you?

548
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,890
Don't do anything foolish.
Wait for Luis.

549
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,530
I've been wondering about that.

550
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,530
The boy they sent out seems to be
having trouble finding his way back.

551
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,630
- He's hunting for Chama.
- Think so?

552
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:43,640
Luis is up there.
He knows, and he'll come.

553
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,370
With a gun or without one,
but he'll come.

554
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:55,530
I certainly do hope so.

555
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,130
If he doesn't,

556
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,400
he's gonna disappoint
an awful lot of people.

557
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,140
You don't blink soon,
your eyeballs will fall out.

558
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,710
Hey, how 'bout somebody else
comin' up here for a while?

559
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:44,360
You wanna take that,
Lamarr?

560
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,560
Why not?

561
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:24,740
Come on, Lamarr.

562
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:27,040
Let's get up here.

563
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:30,480
When this is over,
we finish it.

564
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,050
From the table where
they put the guns.

565
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:56,410
I don't even
know if it fires.

566
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,420
Don't worry.
It fires.

567
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,310
I have lived here
with my people 33 years.

568
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,450
and this morning,

569
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,550
I can't look in their faces.

570
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,430
I can't bless five of them...

571
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,970
and send them outside.

572
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,020
Well, Padre,

573
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,020
we'll see.

574
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:34,630
- He's dead.
- Yeah, I believe you.

575
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,960
Send up his gun and hat,
will ya?

576
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,530
Hey, Lamarr,
don't you fall asleep up there.

577
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,040
Why don't you go screw yourself?

578
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,370
That sweet boy's
fallen asleep,

579
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,640
or he's fallen
off the tower.

580
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,120
Oh, let him alone.
He's had a bad night.

581
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,030
Let's get five of 'em
out here. Come on.

582
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,770
I want Chama to see the facts of life
starin' him in the face.

583
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:46,290
Roy. Mingo.

584
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,050
You fellas get out
in the field.

585
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:18,420
Get against the rocks
where you can do some good!

586
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,720
There they are, Chama!

587
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:45,720
Are you gonna
come down now?

588
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,660
Chama, you've
got one minute!

589
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:26,770
That's not much of
a shot for you, is it, Mingo?

590
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,010
- It's where you hit 'em.
- I'll pick a spot.

591
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,810
First man, second button.
For six bits.

592
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,080
But you gotta hit the button.

593
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:40,900
For six bits, I'll hit
the second button on both men.

594
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,220
Jesus!

595
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,030
Mingo, shoot two of 'em,
right now.

596
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:05,500
- How're you doing?
- Don't touch it.

597
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:18,750
You would've let them
kill those people.

598
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:20,760
I'm going to tell
you something,

599
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,560
and you must listen
and try and understand.

600
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,700
If our people are killed
for what we are doing,

601
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:31,070
they will become names,
they will live forever.

602
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:34,770
Martyrs? I think we have
enough of them already.

603
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,320
Then why do you want me
to become one?

604
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,410
Listen!

605
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,150
We only win
if I stay alive.

606
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:48,570
If those men kill me now,
who will take my place?

607
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:54,010
Do you understand?

608
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,670
You'd let people die for you?

609
01:05:56,750 --> 01:06:00,440
For themselves.
For what they believe.

610
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,540
They believe in you.

611
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,710
I am telling you how it is.

612
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:08,150
There is no other way!

613
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:10,320
I know another way.

614
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:14,380
Come with me,
back to Sinola.

615
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,260
Give yourself up,
take your chances in court.

616
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:19,890
Stay out of it.

617
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:21,600
You brought me into it...

618
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:23,600
when you stole my horses
and bob-wired my man.

619
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,710
And you killed one of ours.

620
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:30,410
So, you help her. Now we are even.
Go home while you can.

621
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:33,220
He is right.
We must give ourselves up.

622
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:36,020
Don't you see?
There is no other way.

623
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:38,650
I do not care
what you think.

624
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:41,130
I take you along
for cold nights...

625
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,690
and days when there
is nothing to do,

626
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:45,570
not to hear you talk.

627
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:00,880
Harlan!

628
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:04,530
You want Chama?

629
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:08,760
You'll find him
in the Sinola jail.

630
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,930
Let's mount up.

631
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,170
Just like that, huh?

632
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:24,240
Straight up or draped over
the saddle, either one.

633
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,650
What about my men?

634
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:30,120
I don't much care about them.

635
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:33,180
They can come along or stay,
whatever pleases them.

636
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:36,360
Listen to this Anglo
son-of-a-bitch!

637
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,370
Luis, say it,

638
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,710
we throw him off the cliff.

639
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:44,910
No te metas en esto.

640
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:48,080
Bien, que éste
no es el lugar.

641
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:52,590
All right. This isn't the time.
We will settle this later.

642
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:55,860
Vamonos con él.

643
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:58,900
? Pero quién sabe
hasta donde?

644
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,810
The train stop here,
Mr. Harlan?

645
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,890
It'll stop, Eljay.

646
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:28,820
Hold your fire.
They're out of range.

647
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:31,090
No disparen.
Esta muy lejos.

648
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,550
Compadre.

649
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:30,480
There'll be eleven.

650
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:35,580
Hi.

651
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:38,030
Hey, little girl.

652
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,040
Oh. You don't let a person
get a chance to breathe.

653
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:44,100
I'll get you breathing
so you're never gonna stop.

654
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:46,870
- You miss me?
- 'Course I did.

655
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:48,880
- You stayed here in the room?
- I sure did.

656
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:51,980
Like hell you did.

657
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:56,250
Mr. Harlan, ma'am,
how was your huntin' trip?

658
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,020
- Mitchell, how you been?
- Just fine.

659
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:01,490
Someone's gonna bring
Luis Chama in tomorrow,

660
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:05,090
and I want you to
hand him over to me.

661
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:09,100
- What'd you say?
- I want you to hand him over to me.

662
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:13,230
- Mr. Harlan...
- Take a few days off and get drunk!

663
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:16,670
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Go to church and pray...

664
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:20,190
that I don't see you again
'til this is done!

665
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:24,460
Little girl, find some whiskey
and pour me a drink.

666
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,200
Good morning.

667
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:01,010
Let's open up.

668
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,740
- We're closed.
- You're open.

669
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:07,910
We're open.

670
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:59,110
All right, I say Chama
goes to jail, pleads his case.

671
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:01,420
What do you say?

672
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:20,180
Adios, compadres.
Que les vaya bien.

673
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,010
Not you, Ramon.

674
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:26,770
Ramon.

675
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:39,140
Lead off, huh?

676
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:56,360
I figured
we might be too close.

677
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:04,380
Come on in, Kidd.

678
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:06,510
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

679
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:12,050
Hey, Kidd.
Bring Chama over here.

680
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:15,590
Come on in, Kidd.

681
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:51,070
Mitchell!

682
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:53,500
Got a prisoner for ya.

683
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:59,770
Jesus, Joe!

684
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:03,300
Here. Give me some cover.
Start with the hotel.

685
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:53,780
Bob,

686
01:24:53,850 --> 01:24:56,010
get out of here!

687
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:43,770
Good luck.

688
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,130
Well,
that settles that.

689
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,770
Anything
I can do for you, Joe?

690
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:16,210
Come on.

691
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:25,650
Joe, you shouldn't
have done that.

692
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,600
Next time, I'll knock
your damn head off.
