1
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:11,890
Sure itching to use
that thing again, ain’t you?

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,141
Never hurts to be ready.

3
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:21,136
You're always ready. Put it away.
- You’re nervous, Al.

4
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:28,012
I wouldn't be if it wasn't for you.

5
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:31,210
What time are we meeting Barlow?
- Ten o'clock.

6
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:34,435
Ever been to this place, Plainview?

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,090
Nope.

8
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:42,348
Never heard of it.
I doubt it's got a bank. If it does,
it's probably got $1.30 in it.

9
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:47,494
Harvest time. A lot of money
changes hands this time of year.

10
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:54,024
I'm sick of two-bit towns. What's
wrong with places like Abilene?
- Everything.

11
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:01,632
They have a lot of cash to pay the trail drivers.
- That’s just it.
Where there’s cash, there’s guns.

12
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:09,206
We're not exactly amateurs.
- That’s why we’re alive. We’ll stay
that way if we stick to small towns.

13
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:17,821
Your brother's right. Nobody wears
guns in a place like Plainview
except the town marshal.

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,593
Moore, bring up the horses.

15
00:01:27,374 --> 00:01:30,889
We'll look the town over
for five minutes.

16
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,996
If anything looks wrong, we'll leave.

17
00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:20,892
The bank's on the right of the
street. Two people work there -
owner and a teller. No guns.

18
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:23,459
How about the street?
- No guns there either.

19
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:28,966
A bunch of farmers, mostly. They've
got a town marshal, an old timer.

20
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:34,310
How about his gun?
- Couldn't see if he was wearing one.

21
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:39,620
We'll do it the same as always.
Me and Bob work inside.

22
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:00,306
Hey, Hank!

23
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:07,143
Good morning, Doc!
- Ready? Let's get on with it!

24
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:12,206
Morning, Doc, Marshal.
- Cigars here yet?
- Should be this afternoon.

25
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:14,807
You can't rely on anything!

26
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:19,063
A few more hours
without a cigar won't harm you.

27
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:22,699
Don't get philosophic.
You're not that old.

28
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:30,357
The first two cigars
are gonna be given away free.
Pass the word around.

29
00:04:30,392 --> 00:04:32,377
Sure!

30
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:38,823
I'll take the white.
- You had white last time.

31
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:44,501
Do you want 'em?
- No, I don't want 'em.
- Talk, talk, talk!

32
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,151
Martha, good morning to you!
- Coffee's on.

33
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:57,096
Thank you.

34
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:04,021
I'm glad Tim's feeling better.
- Thank you, Jack.
- That's fine.

35
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:12,734
Morning, Jack.
- Morning, Larry. Mr Livingstone.

36
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:17,555
Hello, Jack. How are things going?
- Can’t complain. Still solvent?

37
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:24,575
Thriving.
Keep bringing me money every day
and I might stay in business!

38
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,395
Here you are, Mr Wright.
- Thanks, Larry.

39
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,877
Goodbye, Mr Livingstone.
- See you later, Jack.

40
00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:34,500
Morning, Ellie.

41
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:06,733
Ah! Martha, if I were a younger man
and you weren't already married, I...

42
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,296
Check.

43
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:12,959
Doc, you're not trustworthy.

44
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:15,869
You're a miserable, underhanded...

45
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:21,024
If you can't concentrate, you can't
play. I've told you 100 times!

46
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:26,473
Reminds me of playing the General.

47
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:31,969
What general was that, Doc?
- Robert Edward Lee!

48
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:34,818
It was at Fredericksburg...
- In '62.

49
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:42,464
Right after you drove back the
federals. It was a wintry Saturday
night and... now YOU'RE in check!

50
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,337
Sis, where do you want these?

51
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,624
Oh - over there please Wally.

52
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:03,052
How about this
for the bedroom curtains?
- Fine. There go the profits!

53
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:06,738
I'll get the other two sacks.
- Thank you.

54
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:14,339
Why is it some people can’t carry
on a conversation without shouting?

55
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:22,027
How can a man concentrate with that
cowbell jingling every few seconds?

56
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:27,810
That's why I love to play chess with
you. You're such a good loser!

57
00:07:27,845 --> 00:07:30,835
We'll see who's the good loser!

58
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:39,612
What's the excitement?
- Pop, how’s my credit?

59
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:44,619
Your account's pretty big. Two
afternoons of sweeping the store.

60
00:07:44,654 --> 00:07:47,768
He promised, didn't he?
- Sure he did!

61
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:50,847
Could I charge some candy?
- Sure you can.

62
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:56,422
I want a peppermint stick!
- All right. You all want peppermint sticks?

63
00:07:56,457 --> 00:07:59,978
I want a liquorice whip.
- All right, Joey.

64
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,959
There.

65
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:10,209
Pop, what about Wallboy?
- Almost forgot him, didn't I? Here.

66
00:08:10,244 --> 00:08:12,590
Thanks, Pop!

67
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,537
Come on, Wallboy!

68
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,981
Here you are, Mrs Canfield.

69
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:17,010
Four, five, six dollars
and 75 cents. Thank you, Larry.

70
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:20,629
Hello, Ralph. How are you?

71
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:34,537
Don't move.

72
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:38,064
Except to raise your hands.

73
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:44,551
Move over.

74
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,374
That's enough.

75
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:03,451
Sit still, Mister.
Don’t move at all.

76
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:34,502
That's it.

77
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:28,058
Come on, Al!

78
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:04,970
Dead.

79
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:09,203
Good. They robbed the bank
and they killed Larry.

80
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:12,236
Look! Here's the money,
Mr Livingstone.

81
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:17,129
Nice shooting, George.
- It was Jack's shot that did it.

82
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:20,015
That's right. I saw the whole thing.

83
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,850
Jack took the marshal's gun
and plugged him.

84
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:26,342
Billy, your dad shot a bank bandit!

85
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:27,944
Yeah!

86
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:34,976
Carry him into the jail.
What a shot! It must be 50,
60 yards from the store!

87
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:38,376
I never thought he could
handle a gun like that!

88
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:31,266
Come on - sit down, Martha.

89
00:13:42,496 --> 00:13:47,775
Jack. Jack, you're a hero.
We're in your debt, my friend.

90
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,290
That was a great shot.

91
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:56,255
I missed him three times with
the rifle and I was a lot closer.

92
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:04,174
Wait a minute. I'm glad I got him
but it was just a lucky shot.
I grabbed the marshal's gun and...

93
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:11,357
...put a bullet in him from 70 yards!
That wasn't luck.
It was cool, deliberate shooting.

94
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:18,505
If there were more men like you
and Henderson in the country,
we wouldn't have any outlaws!

95
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,803
"Outlaw shot by local marksman
identified as Alvin Dennis, wanted in Kansas.

96
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:30,334
"Alvin Dennis, wanted in Kansas
for bank robbery and murder,

97
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:36,123
"was shot in Plainview yesterday
after he and his gang
held up the bank.

98
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:41,878
"Witnesses said the first bullet to
hit Dennis was fired by Jack Wright,

99
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:46,068
"owner of the general store,
from almost 100 yards.

100
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:49,959
"George Henderson,
another townsman..."

101
00:14:51,113 --> 00:14:54,822
All right. Let's be going.

102
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:01,665
Where are we going, Bob?
- Plainview.

103
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,023
What for?
- Get us a couple of marksmen.
- What good'll that do?

104
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:10,313
It'll do me a lot of good.

105
00:15:12,722 --> 00:15:15,407
We all feel sorry about Al.

106
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:18,869
Yeah, I can see that!

107
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:21,441
Al knew the chance he was taking.

108
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:23,343
Yeah...

109
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:31,904
He knew the chance he was taking
when he busted you out of jail.

110
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:38,412
I'm not asking any of you to go with me.
He was MY brother, not yours.

111
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:40,714
Wait a minute.

112
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:43,445
We're all going with you.

113
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,458
Sure we are.

114
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:52,537
Bring that paper.

115
00:15:58,268 --> 00:16:01,839
Who's the lucky girl tonight, Wally?
Sally Livingstone again?

116
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:08,495
Sis, I’m surprised at you!
If I saw her tonight as well
as last night, she’d get ideas!

117
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,758
I thought WOMEN were fickle!

118
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,158
Heaven help you if you meet a girl
like Martha. You'll never get away!

119
00:16:16,193 --> 00:16:19,215
As I recall,
you didn't try very hard.

120
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,905
I fought like a tiger!

121
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,036
Why aren't you at the saloon?
- I didn’t think I’d go.

122
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:28,204
You and Mr Henderson
are guests of honour.

123
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:29,665
I know.
- What?

124
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:35,074
Mr Livingstone's getting drinks for
everyone. Speechmaking too, I bet.

125
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:40,448
You'd better get over there. Well,
guess I kept her waiting long enough.

126
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:44,798
She’ll be mad. We can make up. Night.
- Good night, Wally.

127
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:50,466
Is that true? You and George
Henderson guests of honour?

128
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:53,201
Yes, but...
- I think you should go.

129
00:16:53,236 --> 00:17:01,086
I don't feel right about it.
Celebrating because I helped kill a man...
- Don’t be silly.

130
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:07,388
Well, I...
- Every man in town will be there.
They’re proud of you. They should be.

131
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:13,186
Martha, I...
- Come on. I'll have to teach
you how to act like a hero.

132
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:16,415
All right.
- Go on. Have a good time.

133
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,242
I'll try.

134
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:28,727
So I paced it off,
just to convince myself.

135
00:17:28,762 --> 00:17:36,316
From where Jack Wright was
standing to where Alvin Dennis
was leaving town, it was 138 yards.

136
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:42,505
Every time he tells it,
the distance gets farther!

137
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,557
You're very modest, Jack. I think
you boys can count on a good reward.

138
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,919
I sure could use it!

139
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:57,156
Dennis was wanted in Kansas, dead or alive.
I've written to the authorities.
- That’s nice of you.

140
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:04,073
It was my bank they tried to rob!
The least I can do is see you're rewarded!

141
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:08,436
Even if I have to take it
out of my own pocket!

142
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:14,649
Walter! Keep everyone's glass full.
I don't want to see a sober man
by midnight!

143
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:22,241
Drink up! You've earned it!
- I’ve had more tonight
that I usually have in a month.

144
00:18:22,276 --> 00:18:26,729
You can't stay sober at your own
celebration! Come on, drink up!

145
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:30,646
No point in letting it go to waste!

146
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:38,575
Good. Must be at least
six months old!

147
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,924
You drink more than
any three men in town
and I've never seen you drunk.

148
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:48,928
It's an accomplishment,
I'll agree, but a minor one.

149
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:55,198
Not as significant as knocking an outlaw
off a horse at 60, 70 or 100 yards...

150
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:59,566
with a handgun.
- Cut it out. You don’t believe it, do you?

151
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:03,137
No, I don't. But do you?
- How do you mean?

152
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:06,631
What I said.
- You don’t think I believe it?

153
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:13,651
I never shot a six-gun in my life.
I picked it up and pointed it.
Pure blind luck.

154
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,941
Nobody believes it.

155
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:21,630
Keep thinking that way and
you won't get into trouble... I hope.

156
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:25,181
Having a good time, Jack?
I sure am!

157
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:29,312
Let's drink to Plainview,
town of law and order!

158
00:19:33,162 --> 00:19:38,043
Have another, Mister?
They're free tonight.
- Thanks. I will.

159
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:55,456
Listen! In case you've forgotten,
Plainview lost its marshal, God rest his soul.

160
00:19:55,491 --> 00:20:01,360
I nominate to take his place,
the man who used his gun so well,
Jack Wright.

161
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:08,232
Thanks, boys.
Thanks a lot, but I can't do it.

162
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:09,969
I can't handle a gun. That was...

163
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:16,661
I've got a store to run.
That takes all my time.

164
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:22,180
The man I think ought to be marshal
is George Henderson. How about it?

165
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:30,952
Gentlemen, now is as good a time
as any to elect ourselves a marshal.

166
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:35,845
As far as I can tell, practically
every eligible voter in town is here.

167
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,447
Jack Wright declined the job,
so I think we should follow
his suggestion.

168
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:47,648
How about it, George?
Are you willing to serve as marshal?

169
00:20:47,683 --> 00:20:50,639
I am. I'd be mighty proud to.

170
00:20:50,674 --> 00:20:56,579
All those in favour of George
Henderson for marshal, say "aye".

171
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:58,269
Aye!

172
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:01,176
Opposed?...Unanimous!

173
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:04,003
George, you got the job!

174
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:11,365
My first official act is to buy a
round of drinks. Then I'm going home
while I can still ride!

175
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,873
George will make a fine marshal,
don't you think, Doc?

176
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:32,198
Anybody can be a good marshal. Pete
MacKay was a fine one for five years.

177
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:36,767
In all that time,
he never had to use his gun once.

178
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:40,999
Until the day they killed him.

179
00:21:59,433 --> 00:22:03,310
Good night, gentlemen!
- Good night, Doc!

180
00:22:03,345 --> 00:22:08,601
Sure you’re all right, George?
You’re welcome to stay at my place.

181
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:12,471
No, no thanks.
Wife's liable to worry.

182
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:19,947
Besides, I got half a dozen cows to
milk in the morning and they'd be
mighty put out if I didn't show up!

183
00:22:19,982 --> 00:22:23,053
Want me to give you a boost?
- Oh, no.

184
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:31,579
Maybe just a little one.
- Ready, marshal?

185
00:22:31,614 --> 00:22:34,244
Oh... Made it!

186
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:38,795
Come on, Blue. We're going home!
Good night, Jack! Good night!

187
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,635
Night, boys!
- Night, marshal!

188
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:48,913
George is the happiest marshal
we ever had!

189
00:22:48,948 --> 00:22:50,356
Tonight, anyway!

190
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:24,559
Your name Henderson?
- That’s right.

191
00:23:24,594 --> 00:23:28,325
The new marshal -
the fella that shot Alvin Dennis?

192
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:31,482
Yeah.

193
00:23:32,673 --> 00:23:34,504
Who are you?

194
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:37,447
My name's Dennis too.

195
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:44,309
Shots.

196
00:23:46,836 --> 00:23:50,749
Give me the paper.
- What?
- The newspaper!

197
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:55,284
The whole town will be here
any minute!

198
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:22,763
It's George Henderson.

199
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:26,806
He's got at least four slugs in him.

200
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:33,947
Hey, Jack...

201
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:35,684
Jack.

202
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,966
Look at this.

203
00:24:57,466 --> 00:25:00,074
Jack, don't you worry.

204
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:02,623
We're with you, every one of us.

205
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:05,769
Yeah, sure. Sure we are.

206
00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:19,642
Will that be all, Mrs Metcalf?
- That’s all, thank you.

207
00:25:19,677 --> 00:25:22,965
I'll have Wally bring it right over.
- Bye.

208
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:28,004
That looks mighty fine, Bill.

209
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:36,968
How's it coming, Wally?
- Finished. Wire staples, just short of
a keg. Shingle nails, a keg and a half.

210
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:42,319
Fine on everything except tools.
- We could use more wire and staples.

211
00:25:42,354 --> 00:25:46,396
Nearly fence-fixing time.
- I’ll order them in the morning.

212
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:50,049
Will you take Mrs Metcalf's order over?
- All right.

213
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,246
Those windows are clean, Billy.
Why don't you go outside and play?

214
00:26:08,677 --> 00:26:11,151
What's the matter, son?

215
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:15,225
Nothing. I just want
to talk to Pop about something.

216
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:24,465
What is it, Bill?

217
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,393
Pop, I know what happened
to Mr Henderson.

218
00:26:28,428 --> 00:26:32,286
About the newspaper
picture and everything.

219
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:35,943
The Dennis gang did it, didn't they?

220
00:26:35,978 --> 00:26:37,698
Yes.

221
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:40,106
Yes, it looks that way.

222
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:45,204
They're saying that the gang
might come back again... after you.

223
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:48,436
I don't think there's much chance of that.

224
00:26:48,437 --> 00:26:54,410
The men who shot Mr Henderson are
cowards. He was alone, outside of town.

225
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:58,899
We live right here in town. There's
hardly any reason to leave it.

226
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:01,750
We went to the canyon last Sunday.

227
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:07,257
We might give that up for a while.
I've got a lot of work here, anyway.

228
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,093
But... supposing they're not cowards.

229
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:15,316
Suppose... suppose they come back into town...
- They wouldn’t dare.

230
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:18,124
Pop, I'm scared for you.

231
00:27:23,312 --> 00:27:28,488
Most men get scared one time or
another, no matter how old they are.

232
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:33,042
Usually it's for themselves
but sometimes it's for others.

233
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:35,560
It's a very kind thing.

234
00:27:35,595 --> 00:27:39,884
Just remember - we're not alone.
We're part of a community.

235
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,550
And they're all on our side.

236
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:44,681
Here.

237
00:27:47,143 --> 00:27:49,714
It's on the house.

238
00:27:52,427 --> 00:27:57,034
I’m sorry.
- Nothing to be sorry about.
Feel better now?

239
00:27:57,069 --> 00:28:02,609
Yes, but... you should start carrying
a gun. You've got one in that drawer.

240
00:28:02,644 --> 00:28:07,519
It's been in there for years.
I don't think it's ever been fired.

241
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:11,298
Remember this.
I'm a storekeeper, not a gunman.

242
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:16,635
But that shot you made...
- I told you it was just luck. Nothing else.

243
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,296
Now, come on. Run out and play.

244
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:29,887
Pop... do you suppose there'll be
room in this town for another store?

245
00:28:29,922 --> 00:28:34,849
That's what I want to be when
I grow up. A storekeeper like you.

246
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:39,776
I always figured you could have
this one. Will that be all right?

247
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:42,208
Sure! Come on, Wallboy!

248
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:02,827
I still say if they did it
the first time, they'll do it again.

249
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:09,279
You see the Amarillo newspaper?
George Henderson's picture
crossed out and Jack...

250
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:14,635
You sound like my wife.
She can't talk about anything else.

251
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,658
MY wife says we should
take our kids and move away.

252
00:29:18,693 --> 00:29:22,068
Do you think the gang
will come after Wright?

253
00:29:22,103 --> 00:29:25,700
I don't know.
I kind of doubt it, though.

254
00:29:25,735 --> 00:29:29,257
I say it's Wright's problem, not ours.

255
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:33,303
That's not so. He did the town
a favour. It's everybody's problem.

256
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:42,998
Afternoon, gentlemen. Bartender,
some of the coldest beer you've got.

257
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:48,527
Marshal, you're a welcome sight...
providing you're not passing through.

258
00:29:48,562 --> 00:29:51,853
No, I'm not.
I'm here to check on a shooting.

259
00:29:51,888 --> 00:29:56,731
The Dennis gang did it. We'd no
sooner elected Henderson marshal...

260
00:29:56,766 --> 00:30:03,274
We've been expecting them back.
- We're glad to see you, Marshal.
Have another beer.

261
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:06,465
No thanks. Where can I find
your town marshal?

262
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,951
We haven't got one.

263
00:30:08,986 --> 00:30:15,391
The Amarillo office got a letter from
a Mr Livingstone. Is he here?

264
00:30:15,426 --> 00:30:17,628
He's our banker.

265
00:30:17,663 --> 00:30:21,952
I'd better check into the hotel.
- I’ll take you over.

266
00:30:23,164 --> 00:30:30,832
Well, I'll see you later.
I'll tell my wife about this.
Maybe now she'll shut up.

267
00:30:45,488 --> 00:30:47,035
Bob.

268
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:50,790
About time. We've been here
more than a week.

269
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:53,898
What do you say?
- Hi.
- I got some news.

270
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:58,072
Federal marshal's due to leave
Plainview tomorrow.

271
00:30:58,172 --> 00:31:01,263
Sure?
- He's expected in Amarillo tomorrow night.

272
00:31:01,397 --> 00:31:07,437
How'd you find out?
- I walked into his office
and said I was an old friend.

273
00:31:07,472 --> 00:31:12,119
We'll wait an extra day to be sure.
We'll get there at 10...

274
00:31:12,154 --> 00:31:16,767
Get where by 10?
- Plainview. We didn’t finish our business there.

275
00:31:16,802 --> 00:31:19,509
I don't like it.
- Nobody asked you to.

276
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,007
They might be expecting us.

277
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:25,115
More to it than that.
- What do you mean?

278
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:32,636
We've got to get that storekeeper.
He killed your brother
and they've made a hero of him.

279
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:37,555
If we don't keep 'em scared, they'll
take pot shots at us in every town.

280
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,806
They'll do that anyway.
- Not if we keep "em scared enough.

281
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:44,297
We're still sticking our necks out.

282
00:31:44,332 --> 00:31:48,359
If you want a safe job,
take up bookkeeping.

283
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:51,474
It might be easier to do it at night.

284
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,555
All right -
that's the way we'll do it.

285
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:18,924
Hi, Clem. Sorry if I'm late.
- You're not late. What's wrong?

286
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:24,241
The federal marshal's leaving.
- What are you talking about?

287
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:30,715
Livingstone told me this afternoon.
If we talk to him, he might change his mind.

288
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,600
Yeah, yeah, sure. Leaving?
I don't understand it!

289
00:32:42,643 --> 00:32:48,752
Who is it?
- We’d like to talk to you.
It’s Clem Clark and Al Ferguson.

290
00:32:53,613 --> 00:32:58,370
Come in, gentlemen.
- Marshal, we understand you’re leaving.
- Yes.

291
00:32:58,405 --> 00:33:03,088
You can’t!
- I have to. I'm writing the last of my report now.

292
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:09,278
My orders are to return to Amarillo.
- If you have to stay on, that’s up to you.

293
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:12,728
Yes, it is,
but I see no reason to stay.

294
00:33:12,763 --> 00:33:17,316
What about the newspaper the Dennis
gang left? That was a threat.

295
00:33:17,351 --> 00:33:22,796
Threats like that are pretty common,
but they're only to scare people.

296
00:33:22,831 --> 00:33:28,242
They've succeeded in this town.
All the women are scared to death.

297
00:33:29,337 --> 00:33:32,194
They'll get over it.

298
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:35,995
If you don't mind,
I'd like to finish my report.

299
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,044
Look, marshal...

300
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:44,985
would you consider
staying as our town marshal?
We'd pay you more than you get now.

301
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,653
Good night, gentlemen.

302
00:33:47,688 --> 00:33:50,286
...Good night, marshal.

303
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:01,497
Look, marshal, you have to stay
for a while. We need you!

304
00:34:01,532 --> 00:34:06,504
I'm finished. I came to investigate
a shooting and bank hold-up.

305
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:10,074
I've written my report.
Now I must go.

306
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:17,026
You don't understand our situation.
- You’re jittery. So’s everybody else.
You’ll get over it.

307
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:21,676
In two weeks nothing's happened.
I don't think anything will.

308
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:26,292
We need some law enforcement!
- Elect yourself a town marshal.

309
00:34:28,262 --> 00:34:31,356
Goodbye. Thanks for your help.
- Goodbye.

310
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:38,814
Goodbye, Mr Wright.

311
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:45,244
You're leaving?
- Yeah. Good luck.
- You don't think the Dennis gang'll be back?

312
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:51,366
We've looked all over
this part of the country.
I doubt they're even in the state.

313
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:55,517
Take care of yourself.
Give my best to the missus.
- I'll do that.

314
00:35:01,107 --> 00:35:03,632
Bye, marshal!

315
00:35:23,135 --> 00:35:25,673
That's a horse.

316
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:29,326
No, it's a burro.
- What's a burro?

317
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:32,555
It's a... well, it's not a horse.

318
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:36,068
It looks like a horse. Why isn't it?

319
00:35:36,103 --> 00:35:39,385
Because it isn't.
- It's a horse!

320
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,629
I wanna see the horse again!

321
00:35:42,664 --> 00:35:46,852
You kids get ready for bed.
- Let me finish my story!

322
00:35:46,887 --> 00:35:51,041
It's late. Finish it tomorrow.
- Do as you're told, Joey
You too, Cynthia.

323
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:54,489
Good night, sweetie.

324
00:35:56,511 --> 00:35:59,162
Joey, what's a burro?

325
00:36:05,022 --> 00:36:08,244
I hear the federal marshal left today.

326
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:12,329
Yeah. That's right.
- What's going to happen now?

327
00:36:12,364 --> 00:36:15,677
Well... elect a town marshal, I suppose.

328
00:36:15,712 --> 00:36:17,584
Who?

329
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:20,816
I don't know.
We haven't selected one yet.

330
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:23,678
You know no-one will take that job.

331
00:36:23,713 --> 00:36:26,490
Don't worry about it, Em!

332
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:31,235
Where are you going?
- I'm out of tobacco.

333
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,932
Don't go to the store tonight, Clem.

334
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:38,233
Don't be silly! Nothing's
going to happen tonight!

335
00:36:38,268 --> 00:36:41,686
How do you know
those men won't come back?

336
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:46,727
If they were going to, they'd have
done it. It's been over two weeks.

337
00:36:46,762 --> 00:36:50,976
The marshal's been here
all that time. He isn't here now.

338
00:36:51,011 --> 00:36:54,514
Jack Wright and I are friends.
If he's in trouble...

339
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:58,641
Trouble? It isn't just trouble.
He's in danger.

340
00:36:58,676 --> 00:37:03,989
Real danger. So is anyone who's
around him. Can't you see that?

341
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:08,035
You're making more out of this
than it really is.

342
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:14,293
I hope so. But I'm frightened.
I'm frightened for the children and...

343
00:37:14,328 --> 00:37:19,996
if anything happened to you,
I don't know what I'd do.

344
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:22,772
All right, all right.

345
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,514
I won't go to the store.

346
00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:53,376
No mail for you, Doc.
- I wasn’t expecting any.

347
00:37:53,411 --> 00:37:55,938
Paper if you'd like to read it.

348
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,789
You ought to learn to play this game.

349
00:37:58,824 --> 00:38:04,626
I'd like to, some day.
- I’ll give you a lesson.
- Not right now, Doc.

350
00:38:04,661 --> 00:38:08,573
You sure got plenty of time for it.

351
00:38:08,608 --> 00:38:12,094
This place hasn't been
overflowing with business lately.

352
00:38:17,301 --> 00:38:20,142
Hello, Mr Wright.
- Hi, Pop.

353
00:38:20,177 --> 00:38:25,001
Hello. How are you, Cynthia?
- Fine, thank you.
- Business or social?

354
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:29,967
I guess it's both.
I haven't used my credit...

355
00:38:30,002 --> 00:38:34,200
On a day like this, refreshments
are on the house.
- Thanks!

356
00:38:34,235 --> 00:38:36,250
I want a peppermint stick.
- Yes...

357
00:38:36,285 --> 00:38:39,861
Two liquorice sticks.
- Thanks, Mr Wright!

358
00:38:39,896 --> 00:38:43,396
Thought you'd like some coffee.
- Thank you, Martha.

359
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:49,518
I'd rather have a liquorice whip instead.
- Finish the peppermint stick first

360
00:38:49,553 --> 00:38:55,133
Mr Wright, how'd you learn how to
shoot a gun? Did you practise a lot?

361
00:38:55,168 --> 00:39:00,714
I said it was just luck!
- My dad said your dad's
the best shot in town.

362
00:39:00,749 --> 00:39:03,575
Joe! Cynthia! Get home for lunch!

363
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:09,165
But we already had our...
- Don't argue, young man. Come on.

364
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,354
I don't know what's
gotten into these children.
They're so disobedient.

365
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:31,458
Those are the best-behaved children in town.
I've never known them to miss lunch.

366
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:36,072
Always a first time.
- They must have had it. It’s two o’clock.

367
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:41,886
They just finished when I went over
there. What's wrong with Mrs Clark?

368
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:45,357
Nothing. Maybe she forgot.

369
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,757
Hello, folks.

370
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:53,798
Eddie, your mother wants you.
- Why?
- I don't know. Come on.

371
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:56,355
Mom said I don't have to be home...

372
00:39:59,912 --> 00:40:04,064
Take off your coat, Billy.
And hang it up.

373
00:40:06,495 --> 00:40:11,642
This never occurred to me before
but I can understand it very well.

374
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:16,845
Can understand what?
The store’s dangerous, especially for children.

375
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,978
Nonsense. Maybe a couple of women
think so, but they'll get over it.

376
00:40:22,013 --> 00:40:28,509
It isn't just the women. The only
customer we've had in three days is Doc.

377
00:40:28,544 --> 00:40:31,094
I know.

378
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:34,052
Don't worry about losing business.

379
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:41,072
It's the only general store in town.
People will have to come in sooner or later.
- I know.

380
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:44,573
Nice little town we have here, isn't it?

381
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:49,750
If you change your mind about chess,
let me know. I'll be at the saloon.

382
00:40:49,785 --> 00:40:52,245
All right, Doc.

383
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:59,421
Martha! It's the reward money.
$2,500.

384
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:02,177
Nice.

385
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,804
Now, honey...

386
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:11,244
You always find something to worry about.
Well, there's nothing there. Come on.

387
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:13,547
All right, Jack.

388
00:41:13,582 --> 00:41:16,239
I'll take it over to the bank.

389
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:21,337
$2,500. There’s a lot of things
we’ll be able to afford now.

390
00:41:48,521 --> 00:41:50,054
I'll talk to you later.

391
00:41:51,582 --> 00:41:53,570
Hello Jack, how's things?
- Pretty good, Clem.

392
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:57,242
Clem, your kids
were in the store today and...

393
00:42:01,025 --> 00:42:04,099
What got into him?
- Who knows?

394
00:42:04,134 --> 00:42:08,628
Look at this. The state of Kansas
sent me the reward.

395
00:42:08,663 --> 00:42:12,732
That's nice.
...You want to make a deposit?

396
00:42:12,767 --> 00:42:16,801
Sure.
- Bob will take care of it for you.

397
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,820
Here you are, Mr Wright.

398
00:42:30,855 --> 00:42:34,609
Don't you think
I ought to endorse it?

399
00:42:34,644 --> 00:42:37,845
Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't notice.

400
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,026
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
- Thank you...

401
00:43:17,817 --> 00:43:19,853
Hello, Doc.

402
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:38,597
Jack.
- Hello, Al.

403
00:43:38,632 --> 00:43:43,376
I wondered where you were going,
Clem. Must have been thirsty.

404
00:43:43,411 --> 00:43:47,823
I was. Can I buy you a drink, Jack?
- No, thanks.

405
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:52,640
I'll buy the drinks today.
I got the reward money. $2,500.

406
00:43:52,675 --> 00:43:57,423
Set them up for everybody, Walter.
Have one yourself.
- Thanks.

407
00:43:57,458 --> 00:44:00,363
What do you figure on doing with it?

408
00:44:00,398 --> 00:44:05,210
For a long time, I've been thinking
about expanding the store.

409
00:44:05,245 --> 00:44:09,566
I might get some of that new
line of farm machinery.

410
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:13,430
What do you think, Clem?...Mm?

411
00:44:13,465 --> 00:44:16,316
Oh, yeah, sure. Sure, Jack.

412
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:20,861
It’s 2.30. Time sure goes!
I got to be running along.

413
00:44:20,896 --> 00:44:24,415
Thanks for the drink, Jack.
- You’re welcome.

414
00:44:30,476 --> 00:44:31,215
Sorry.
- That’s all right.

415
00:44:50,091 --> 00:44:52,351
Thanks, Jack.

416
00:44:52,386 --> 00:44:57,722
I'll be seeing you.
- Sure you won’t have another?
- I have to get home.

417
00:44:59,216 --> 00:45:01,774
How about some whisky, bartender?

418
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:05,950
Sure, Mister.
- A man gets dried out in this weather.

419
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:11,184
Al?
- Uh-uh.

420
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:19,274
Don't let me keep you if you've got something to do.
- I have things to take care of. Thanks for the drink.

421
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:24,008
Doc...
- My hours are 8.30 to 2.00
unless it's an emergency.

422
00:45:24,043 --> 00:45:26,991
You'd better get out.
- Why?

423
00:45:27,026 --> 00:45:30,917
...My wife will bring
the boy in tomorrow. Bye.

424
00:45:35,919 --> 00:45:41,926
You fellas help yourselves.
Keep track of what you drink and I'll be back.

425
00:45:51,662 --> 00:45:54,201
Howdy.
- Hello.

426
00:45:54,236 --> 00:45:57,069
Everybody sure left all at once.

427
00:45:57,104 --> 00:45:59,636
Yeah... You come from far?

428
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:05,029
All the way from Amarillo. Nice
windy ride, too. Buy you a drink?

429
00:46:05,064 --> 00:46:10,231
I'll buy you one.
Looking for anybody in particular?

430
00:46:10,266 --> 00:46:15,362
Why, no... Should I be?
- I didn’t think you were.

431
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:20,248
Strange little town. If I was
a sensitive man, I’d be insulted.

432
00:46:20,283 --> 00:46:27,291
Everybody leaving when I walk in.
Even the bartender.
You'd think they were scared of me.

433
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,575
They are.

434
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,785
Me? What for?

435
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,883
It's a long story. In the
first place, my name is Wright.

436
00:46:36,918 --> 00:46:40,646
Jack Wright.
- Pleased to meet you. Bob Alexander.

437
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:46,984
Jack Wright. That name sounds familiar.
- It should. I’m a local hero.

438
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:49,672
You don't say?

439
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:56,340
I'm the man who shot the notorious
Alvin Dennis from a distance of half a mile.

440
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:59,020
With a slingshot.

441
00:46:59,055 --> 00:47:04,869
Jack Wright. I read about you in
the Amarillo paper. You really him?

442
00:47:04,904 --> 00:47:08,138
I am.
I've got the reward to prove it.

443
00:47:08,173 --> 00:47:14,681
I see why everybody lit out so fast.
They thought I was one of the Dennis gang.

444
00:47:14,716 --> 00:47:20,326
Well... no sense in hanging around
here. Mighty proud to have met you.

445
00:47:20,361 --> 00:47:23,446
Yeah, run along, out of the line of fire.

446
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:30,899
That's what I'm gonna do.
This ain't my town. What happens
here is none of my business.

447
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:33,194
Good luck, friend.

448
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:48,375
Don't you know it's
dangerous in here, Doc?

449
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,936
Sit down.

450
00:47:56,311 --> 00:48:00,498
Nice town, like you said, Doc.
Nice people.

451
00:48:00,533 --> 00:48:04,986
Same as anywhere, I imagine.
No worse, no better.

452
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:12,359
I don't believe that. What kind
of a country would this be
if people were like this all over?

453
00:48:12,394 --> 00:48:16,341
Maybe you got a point there.
- I don’t understand.

454
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:21,463
I mean... well, look.
Folks came out here from back east.

455
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:26,514
Like my grandfather.
Like a lot of people's grandfathers.

456
00:48:26,549 --> 00:48:32,237
They settled this town way out in
the middle of nowhere and had kids.

457
00:48:32,272 --> 00:48:36,478
But still there weren't
too many people.

458
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:39,396
I mean, everybody knows everybody.

459
00:48:39,431 --> 00:48:43,070
All their problems, worries,
troubles...

460
00:48:43,105 --> 00:48:47,474
Not like in a big city. You know
what I'm trying to say, Doc.

461
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:54,343
Yes, I do.
I mean, take last summer, when the
whole Ferguson family took sick.

462
00:48:54,378 --> 00:49:01,137
We all pitched in. We got his hay in,
milked his cows, got his wheat crop in...

463
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:07,759
Nobody stayed away from his house
because they were afraid
they'd catch the sickness.

464
00:49:07,794 --> 00:49:10,802
I was real proud of Plainview then.

465
00:49:10,837 --> 00:49:13,810
You're not proud of it now?
-No.

466
00:49:13,845 --> 00:49:16,204
Not any more.

467
00:49:19,175 --> 00:49:26,445
Seems to me it’s a lot easier
fighting a danger like this than
a disease nobody can see, but...

468
00:49:29,581 --> 00:49:32,675
I guess the sickness
I got's the worst kind.

469
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,073
No cure for it.

470
00:49:37,011 --> 00:49:39,081
Not here, anyway.

471
00:49:49,428 --> 00:49:54,274
When you came in here
a little while ago, you were mad.

472
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:56,881
But you're not any more.

473
00:49:58,068 --> 00:49:59,781
Jack...

474
00:49:59,816 --> 00:50:01,966
I'm an old man.

475
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:07,123
They say old men are great ones
for giving out advice.

476
00:50:07,894 --> 00:50:10,647
But I haven't got any for you.

477
00:50:10,682 --> 00:50:13,401
But I want to tell you one thing.

478
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:17,351
I like you better...

479
00:50:17,386 --> 00:50:19,734
when you're mad.

480
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:40,718
Did you deposit the cheque?
- Yes.

481
00:51:41,993 --> 00:51:44,567
Took you a long while.

482
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:49,190
After I left, I went to the saloon.
Felt like I needed a drink.

483
00:51:49,225 --> 00:51:55,334
I ran into some friends. Clem Clark,
Al Ferguson, some of the others.

484
00:51:55,369 --> 00:52:00,580
The minute they saw me,
they started edging for the door.

485
00:52:00,615 --> 00:52:03,152
Even the bartender left.

486
00:52:03,187 --> 00:52:10,434
You were right, Martha. Except
for Doc Lacy, everybody is scared
to death to be near me.

487
00:52:17,022 --> 00:52:21,038
Maybe it's like you said -
they'll get over it.

488
00:52:21,073 --> 00:52:23,925
Maybe, Martha. I don't know.

489
00:52:27,423 --> 00:52:29,466
That's some weather we're having!

490
00:52:34,138 --> 00:52:37,255
Anything else I can do, Sis?
- No, thanks.

491
00:52:55,821 --> 00:52:57,812
Thanks, Sis.

492
00:52:57,847 --> 00:52:59,889
Me too.

493
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:04,806
Thanks.

494
00:53:06,385 --> 00:53:09,354
Would you like some more coffee, Jack?

495
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:11,901
No, this is fine, thanks.

496
00:53:11,936 --> 00:53:15,843
Is there any more pie?
- No. Sorry.

497
00:53:15,878 --> 00:53:19,450
Have mine, Billy. I don't want it.
- Thanks, Pop.

498
00:54:17,863 --> 00:54:20,115
I'll get it, Jack.

499
00:54:24,653 --> 00:54:26,691
All right! I'm coming!

500
00:55:18,103 --> 00:55:20,279
Oh, no! Wally!

501
00:55:20,314 --> 00:55:22,455
No, Wally!

502
00:55:28,126 --> 00:55:30,390
Mom. Mom!

503
00:55:55,104 --> 00:56:01,156
Why don't you people go home?
There's nothing any of you can do... now.

504
00:56:17,594 --> 00:56:19,061
Oh!

505
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:27,115
Mom, don't cry!

506
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,347
Don't cry, Mom, please!

507
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:52,421
He was just a boy.
He never did any harm to anyone.

508
00:56:52,456 --> 00:56:55,796
Why did they do it? Why?

509
00:56:57,728 --> 00:57:00,082
Bill...

510
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:03,268
why don't you start
getting ready for bed?

511
00:57:03,303 --> 00:57:05,804
I'll come in a little while.

512
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:13,018
I'll take care of... everything.
If you need me, just call.

513
00:57:13,053 --> 00:57:15,310
You understand?

514
00:57:26,891 --> 00:57:28,784
Jack...

515
00:57:28,819 --> 00:57:31,572
they thought it was you.

516
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,638
I know.

517
00:57:39,675 --> 00:57:44,053
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

518
00:57:44,088 --> 00:57:48,431
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

519
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:52,110
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

520
00:57:52,145 --> 00:57:55,080
He restoreth my soul.

521
00:57:55,115 --> 00:57:59,393
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness, for his name's sake.

522
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:05,548
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

523
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:09,542
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

524
00:58:09,577 --> 00:58:13,501
They rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

525
00:58:15,087 --> 00:58:19,672
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

526
00:58:19,707 --> 00:58:22,615
Thou hast anointed my head with oil.

527
00:58:24,571 --> 00:58:27,594
My cup runneth over.

528
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,985
Surely goodness and mercy

529
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:34,510
shall follow me
all the days of my life

530
00:58:34,545 --> 00:58:38,834
and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord for ever.

531
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,314
Amen.

532
00:58:54,657 --> 00:58:58,230
Any ideas, Doc?
- About what?

533
00:58:58,265 --> 00:59:00,324
Protecting the women and children.

534
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:05,527
And the men?
- I'm serious. We need a marshal.

535
00:59:05,562 --> 00:59:12,468
Well, hire one! Send to Abilene
or Dodge City for a gunman.
Preferably one with two guns.

536
00:59:12,503 --> 00:59:14,006
Or more!

537
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:20,448
We don't want a killer.
- We've got to do something.

538
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,618
No! Look out, Pop!

539
00:59:41,653 --> 00:59:43,614
Look out!

540
00:59:45,134 --> 00:59:47,193
Bill!

541
00:59:47,228 --> 00:59:51,437
Bill, it's all right, son.
It's all right.

542
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:55,740
Bad dream.

543
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:58,710
You're all right now, darling.

544
01:00:32,676 --> 01:00:37,454
I made some coffee a while ago.
Would you like some?
- Yes, please.

545
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,797
We have to leave here, Jack.

546
01:00:52,832 --> 01:00:55,632
Yes... for a while.

547
01:00:58,274 --> 01:01:03,302
Amarillo has good hotels.
Maybe you and Bill would prefer Dallas.

548
01:01:03,337 --> 01:01:05,445
What do you mean?

549
01:01:06,535 --> 01:01:09,095
I can't go with you, Martha.

550
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:11,927
But you can! You must!

551
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:21,169
Sell this place. We’ll go away,
not to Amarillo or Dallas but
to a small town that needs a store.

552
01:01:21,204 --> 01:01:25,667
Maybe we'll go to Oregon or
California. They say the climate...

553
01:01:25,702 --> 01:01:28,708
It's no good, Martha.

554
01:01:28,743 --> 01:01:34,909
You're sending me and Billy away
while you stay and wait for
those men to come back?

555
01:01:34,944 --> 01:01:38,765
What else can I do?
- You’ll be killed!

556
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,612
You don't think our neighbours are
going to do anything to prevent it?

557
01:01:43,647 --> 01:01:48,255
I've got to stay here, Martha.
- Jack, you’re stubborn.

558
01:01:48,256 --> 01:01:54,513
You've always been stubborn but never a fool.
You've never been selfish.

559
01:01:54,548 --> 01:01:57,032
How am I being selfish?

560
01:01:57,067 --> 01:02:02,147
You're only thinking of yourself and
your principles.
- You and Billy...

561
01:02:02,182 --> 01:02:07,228
Me and Billy? Do you care that you
owe it to us to try to stay alive...

562
01:02:07,263 --> 01:02:10,281
instead of committing suicide?

563
01:02:10,316 --> 01:02:15,470
That's what you're doing -
committing suicide for a principle.

564
01:02:15,505 --> 01:02:19,972
I love you more than any principle.
You know that.

565
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:23,102
But can't you see, Martha...

566
01:02:23,137 --> 01:02:31,249
I must defend my - OUR - right
to live decently and honestly
in a place of our own choosing?

567
01:02:31,284 --> 01:02:35,521
If we don't have that,
we don't have any life at all.

568
01:02:35,556 --> 01:02:39,718
Maybe you're right about one thing.
Maybe I AM selfish.

569
01:02:39,753 --> 01:02:44,225
But I'm not going to spend the rest
of my days running away,

570
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:50,233
worrying my family may be killed
any time by a bullet meant for me.

571
01:02:50,268 --> 01:02:54,116
I won't do that, Martha.
I mean it.

572
01:02:59,698 --> 01:03:04,590
I wish I could think of words -
brand new words I've never used -

573
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:07,954
to tell you how very
proud I am of you.

574
01:03:10,006 --> 01:03:15,607
You and Bill can take the stage in the morning.
- We’re not going.

575
01:03:15,642 --> 01:03:17,580
But Martha...
- We’re not leaving.

576
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,512
You can't stay here.
- My place is here with you.

577
01:03:48,404 --> 01:03:50,523
Who is it?

578
01:03:50,558 --> 01:03:52,643
Al Ferguson.

579
01:03:57,579 --> 01:04:00,423
Hi, Al.
- I couldn't sleep.

580
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:02,812
I saw your light.

581
01:04:02,847 --> 01:04:07,599
Sit down.
I’m glad you stopped in. Drink?

582
01:04:07,634 --> 01:04:12,686
No, thanks. Livingstone's back from
Abilene. He stopped by my place.

583
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:19,194
He get somebody?
- No. All he found was a couple
of gunmen who soon lost interest.

584
01:04:19,229 --> 01:04:24,001
Maybe he didn't offer enough money.
- They said it wasn't the salary.

585
01:04:24,036 --> 01:04:27,995
Scared of the Dennis gang.
- They sure are.

586
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:32,724
We've got to find somebody
for that marshal's job!

587
01:04:32,759 --> 01:04:37,235
We'll try Wichita or Dodge City.
We'll find someone.

588
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:41,711
What do we do in the meanwhile?
We need protection now.

589
01:04:41,746 --> 01:04:45,318
Livingstone had some sort
of an idea.

590
01:04:45,353 --> 01:04:49,278
We'll probably have a town
meeting about it tomorrow.

591
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,127
What took you so long?

592
01:05:18,629 --> 01:05:20,995
What's the matter?

593
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:22,422
Here.

594
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,882
We got the wrong man.

595
01:05:34,503 --> 01:05:36,513
YOU got the wrong man.

596
01:05:36,548 --> 01:05:40,668
We'll get the right one this time,
I'll tell you that.

597
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:44,789
Not in the dark.
We're going in the daytime, today,

598
01:05:44,824 --> 01:05:48,032
so everybody can see
what we're doing.

599
01:05:48,067 --> 01:05:53,425
I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna
get him if it's the last thing I do.

600
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:58,450
And he's mine, no matter
what happens - do you understand?

601
01:05:58,485 --> 01:06:00,967
All you have to do is cover me.

602
01:06:01,002 --> 01:06:06,133
We're not leaving
till that storekeeper's guts
have been shot out.

603
01:06:13,158 --> 01:06:16,036
Hello, Miss Clayton.
- Morning.

604
01:06:43,538 --> 01:06:48,054
Where's Jake? We're having a town
meeting at the saloon.

605
01:06:48,089 --> 01:06:51,492
What about?
- Jack Wright.

606
01:06:54,391 --> 01:06:58,669
We're having a town meeting
in 10 minutes over at the saloon.

607
01:07:14,686 --> 01:07:20,113
Did you get the kindling box filled for Mom?
- Yeah. Can I help you here?

608
01:07:20,148 --> 01:07:23,952
You'd better stay in the back,
like I told you.

609
01:07:23,987 --> 01:07:25,483
I wanna stay with you.

610
01:07:26,515 --> 01:07:31,037
There's a meeting of some kind
going on at the saloon.

611
01:07:31,072 --> 01:07:35,515
There is?
- Nobody told you about it
or asked you to come?

612
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:40,226
It doesn't matter.
- Maybe they’re trying to
figure out a way to help.

613
01:07:40,261 --> 01:07:45,076
Yes, that must be it, Jack.
- If it is, we’ll find out soon.

614
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:05,585
Hello, folks.
- Hello, Al.

615
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:11,035
Jack, we'd like to talk to you over
at the saloon if you're not too busy.

616
01:08:13,613 --> 01:08:15,843
I'm not too busy.

617
01:08:26,944 --> 01:08:30,269
Jack, I...
- It’s all right, Al.

618
01:08:30,304 --> 01:08:36,539
No, wait.
Me and my family haven't forgotten
how good you were to us last year.

619
01:08:36,574 --> 01:08:40,359
I always figured
you'd do the same for me.

620
01:08:51,033 --> 01:08:56,721
Jack, I hope you realise there's
nothing personal in what I say.

621
01:08:56,756 --> 01:09:01,120
I'm speaking for everybody
and we're all your friends.

622
01:09:01,155 --> 01:09:06,216
Nobody will ever forget
what you did for Plainview.

623
01:09:06,251 --> 01:09:11,241
But unfortunately it's created
a problem - a big one.

624
01:09:11,276 --> 01:09:16,600
We've been talking about it for some
time and we've come to a decision.

625
01:09:16,635 --> 01:09:21,123
A unanimous decision...
except for one person.

626
01:09:24,061 --> 01:09:27,317
Jack, we have to ask you
to leave Plainview.

627
01:09:27,352 --> 01:09:33,757
The people who want to kill you
will keep trying. We have
wives and children to think about.

628
01:09:33,792 --> 01:09:39,768
Um... if it weren't for them,
it'd be different -
the women and children.

629
01:09:39,803 --> 01:09:45,274
But we can't watch them every
minute and it could happen any time.

630
01:09:45,309 --> 01:09:49,723
I'm sure you understand.
- Sure. I understand.

631
01:09:49,758 --> 01:09:54,604
Now, there's quite a bit of money
here, from all of us.

632
01:09:54,639 --> 01:09:58,109
It's about twice as much
as the store is worth.

633
01:09:58,144 --> 01:10:02,251
If you need more,
we'll see you get it.

634
01:10:02,286 --> 01:10:06,313
Thanks, all of you,
but I won't need it.

635
01:10:06,348 --> 01:10:13,698
We wouldn't ask you to give up
your business without compensation!
- I said I won’t need it...

636
01:10:15,249 --> 01:10:16,976
because I'm not leaving Plainview.

637
01:10:18,266 --> 01:10:23,306
Gentlemen! Let's have order here!
Quiet, please! Everyone!

638
01:10:23,341 --> 01:10:26,898
Sit down. Now, Jack, listen...
- No, you listen.

639
01:10:26,933 --> 01:10:29,833
What I have to say won't take long.

640
01:10:29,868 --> 01:10:33,876
I was born here.
I've lived here all my life.

641
01:10:33,911 --> 01:10:37,779
I used to think it was a good town.
I don't any more.

642
01:10:37,814 --> 01:10:41,180
A town's only as good
as the people in it.

643
01:10:42,346 --> 01:10:48,023
I'm not staying here because
I like it, or because I'm brave.

644
01:10:48,058 --> 01:10:52,526
I'm scared.
I guess you all know what I mean.

645
01:10:52,561 --> 01:10:55,598
Well, I'm more scared
than any of you,

646
01:10:55,633 --> 01:11:00,536
because it's me, my wife or my boy
that's most likely to get shot.

647
01:11:00,571 --> 01:11:03,544
Why? I'll tell you why.

648
01:11:03,579 --> 01:11:08,812
Because as much as you talk about
being good American citizens, you're not.

649
01:11:08,813 --> 01:11:12,767
You had your town meeting here today.

650
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:18,037
You decided to do something
for the community - get rid of me.

651
01:11:18,072 --> 01:11:23,334
You think that'll solve
your biggest problem.
Believe me, it won't.

652
01:11:23,369 --> 01:11:28,559
In this country, the people make
the laws and you're the people.

653
01:11:28,594 --> 01:11:34,408
I don't think one of you'd vote
to make bank robbing
or murder legal.

654
01:11:34,443 --> 01:11:40,223
That's just what you're doing -
making them both legal
without voting.

655
01:11:40,258 --> 01:11:43,271
And you know it.

656
01:11:43,306 --> 01:11:46,527
I said I was more scared
than any of you.

657
01:11:46,562 --> 01:11:53,468
But if you take all your little
fears and put them together,
they're more dangerous than mine.

658
01:11:57,102 --> 01:12:00,054
Jack! Jack! Jack Wright!

659
01:12:00,089 --> 01:12:06,141
Jack! I saw the Dennis gang on their
way here, about half a mile away.

660
01:12:06,176 --> 01:12:10,968
Are you sure it's them?
- Looked like it to me.

661
01:13:29,771 --> 01:13:34,530
I haven't lifted anything heavier
than a whisky bottle in years,
but loan me a gun.

662
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:37,484
No, Doc.
Thanks anyway.

663
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,399
Jack!

664
01:13:42,322 --> 01:13:45,439
Keep Martha and the boy
in back of the store.

665
01:13:51,713 --> 01:13:54,625
Martha, Billy. Come quickly.

666
01:15:37,148 --> 01:15:41,800
Hold it! Drop your guns!
All of you! We're ready to shoot!

667
01:15:41,835 --> 01:15:46,545
Drop your guns and surrender! You're
all covered! Get your hands up!

668
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:50,399
Stay where you are!
We’ve got you covered! Don’t move!

669
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:10,520
Get your hands up!

670
01:16:10,555 --> 01:16:11,592
Up!

671
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:36,674
Thanks, Doc.

672
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:39,856
Get down off those horses!

673
01:17:00,951 --> 01:17:05,013
Jack. The things you told us -
every one of them's true.

674
01:17:05,048 --> 01:17:10,122
We were wrong. We're ashamed.
We'd like to ask you
and your family to forgive us.
