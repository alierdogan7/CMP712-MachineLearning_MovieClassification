1
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,568
You better put on that lamp, too.

2
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,050
$100,000.

3
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,341
You can believe me...

4
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,981
the bank at Daugherty never had
that much cash in its safe at any point.

5
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,150
- Don't worry about it.
- Good night.

6
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,762
- You and Ed, you stay inside.
- All right.

7
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,758
Take it easy, Bill.

8
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:08,858
Hey, Stafford...

9
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,699
send two guards to the back
and put two on Main Street.

10
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,932
- And make it fast.
- Okay.

11
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,112
Close the door.

12
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,294
You enjoy sitting up there and
I'm like a piece of crap in the road?

13
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,098
Scrawny Alley Cat.

14
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,300
Speak right up. I dare you.

15
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,005
Big noise sitting there, aren't you?

16
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,473
And I, Carrincha, I say the Holy Virgin
and all the saints...

17
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,651
they know the truth.

18
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:50,447
That at the Battle of Richmond that
took nine days, I killed how many?

19
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,424
What's the difference? At least 20.

20
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,595
And what do you want?
Don't you believe what I say?

21
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,933
I was a trumpeter in the Seventh Regiment,
that's who.

22
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,097
I could blow up an elephant
with the breath in my body.

23
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,939
But the regiment took my trumpet from me,
I don't know why.

24
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,442
Like my bottle of whiskey.

25
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,578
That Alley Cat up there
thinks they were right.

26
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,509
And all I have left...

27
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,688
was my medal, which I thought was enough
to buy me a bottle.

28
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,183
But they said it was no good.

29
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,055
What are they good for, medals?

30
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,758
In war, they're all compañeros...

31
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,731
then when they get home,
they aren't worth a damn.

32
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,035
Not you, though.

33
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,641
You're a man who knows?

34
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,197
How are you?

35
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,078
Now, watch.

36
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,317
Seven again.

37
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,048
Let's go.

38
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,292
You know what to do. Hurry.

39
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,495
Evening.

40
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,852
Get him out of here.

41
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:49,723
Stafford.

42
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,539
Stafford, Sergeant, where are you?
Milt! Jones!

43
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,913
- Hey, Ed, can you see the others?
- No, not from here.

44
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,684
- Another seven.
- Seven.

45
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,253
Nichols, didn't you lose enough?

46
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,063
Forget it, Nichols, don't bet that.

47
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,466
Make up your mind.

48
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,274
This isn't worth anything.

49
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,352
That's a different thing...

50
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,321
I'll buy it from you
as long as you throw her in, too.

51
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,154
That's a good watch.
I paid a lot of money for it.

52
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,215
Okay.

53
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,097
Sit down.

54
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,129
Sit down and eat.

55
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,538
Your dice are loaded.

56
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,648
Try those.

57
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,799
He told you to eat, didn't he?

58
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,075
Quiet.

59
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,580
- Don't you like music with your supper?
- Just don't try it again.

60
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:32,883
I'm sorry.

61
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,590
Five.

62
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,268
It's your turn, stranger.

63
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,872
You show them, hey, boss?

64
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,673
That's it.

65
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,005
Seven.

66
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,483
- You won.
- Thank you.

67
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,218
He's a friend of mine.
And he's generous, too.

68
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,856
No one can beat him to the draw
with dice or with pistols.

69
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:13,956
At Cuenca one night...

70
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,762
you couldn't see
your hand in front of your face...

71
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,429
- and he got 20 men in ten seconds.
- Liar.

72
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,300
There is nothing to laugh at.

73
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,968
- You're always talking big.
- I'm telling the truth.

74
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,411
Maybe there weren't 20 of them,
but there were at least ten.

75
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,141
If you couldn't see,
how could you count them?

76
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,912
Alley Cat could. He can see in the dark.

77
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,560
Okay...

78
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,470
we did a good job for you, Ferguson.
The wagon's gone already.

79
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,637
The bank...

80
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,080
they killed them...

81
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,575
everybody.

82
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:39,743
The safe...

83
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,020
they took it away.

84
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,480
Get the doctor here right away.

85
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,827
Stand down. Stand down!

86
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,312
Come on, move it.

87
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,945
Calm down.

88
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,814
You can't get in here,
now stand back, everybody.

89
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,446
It's impossible until the sheriff gets here.

90
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:17,983
They did a thorough job.

91
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,615
- Professionals, for sure.
- No doubt about it.

92
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,752
What did you expect them to take?
Small change lying around outside the safe?

93
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,388
I know, but where does that leave all of us?

94
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,856
Get back, all of you.

95
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,727
What is it?

96
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,629
They took the safe. Come in here.

97
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,171
I didn't hear a thing when it happened.

98
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,942
Oh, come on, Jane. Let's take a walk.

99
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,472
You never give a damn about anything,
do you?

100
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,674
And I chose you out of the crowd.

101
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,015
Now, don't take it to heart.
I'm just passing through.

102
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,051
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet, please. I'll explain.

103
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,019
Mulligan, you go to the
commander of the regiment...

104
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,827
and tell Col. Rafferty
to come here to see me immediately.

105
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,733
All right. Look out. Let me through.

106
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,461
We'll need volunteers.

107
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,231
I know.
Harriman's already rounding them up.

108
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,138
If they cross into Mexico, it's over.

109
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,110
Hey, must you call
the Commander of the Regiment in?

110
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,341
- That safe had $100,000 in it.
- It belongs to the Army.

111
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:23,885
Hold it.

112
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,983
Collins, you head for Los Palos.

113
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,358
You others ride with me to the border.

114
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,137
- They cleaned out the bank, Jane?
- Yeah, that's right.

115
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,663
I wish I had the money.
I'd drink whiskey till I drown in it.

116
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,411
Hey, you, on the wagon...

117
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,647
turn back.

118
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,592
There isn't a Winchester going
that can shoot half that distance.

119
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,319
Virginian Brothers.

120
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,985
The greatest acrobats in the world.

121
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,917
In St. Louis, maybe.

122
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:39,614
We have combed the entire place, Colonel.
Not a trace.

123
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,121
I've nothing else
but to notify General Perkins.

124
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,063
Colonel, let me keep looking for them
one more day.

125
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,459
Gentlemen.

126
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,763
Somebody around here lose a safe?

127
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:18,320
They didn't act very friendly
when I told them to bring it back.

128
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,806
All in order, Colonel.

129
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,986
It was a real stroke of luck, Colonel,
getting the safe back.

130
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,129
They're not from these parts.

131
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,328
Hey...

132
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,565
they're from St. Louis.

133
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,506
Sir, you've got a reward coming to you.

134
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,040
Look after him. See about his money.

135
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,359
Here...

136
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,872
you must be thirsty
after all that hard work, right?

137
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,769
A wagon, a two-ton safe?

138
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,540
And seven men? A fine day's work.

139
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,618
First there were seven men,
then seven bodies.

140
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,722
Seven, like on the dice.

141
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,182
Was loading them up any trouble?

142
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,519
I don't like to bury anyone,
but next time I'll lend a hand.

143
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,791
You keep firing and I'll load, okay?

144
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,303
Hey, compadre,
Carrincha isn't afraid of bodies.

145
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,765
I saw lots of them die, those soldiers.
What about that?

146
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:13,010
At Richmond, the battle took nine days
and the army gave me a medal.

147
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,478
What good
do these medals do anyone today?

148
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,375
- Life today is horse droppings.
- You already said that.

149
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,695
- Well, how much do you want?
- You tell me.

150
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,392
$2,000?

151
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,896
$5,000.

152
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,403
All right.

153
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,314
Sgt. Keller will bring you the money.

154
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,775
Hey, you could've got more money
than that.

155
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:58,380
After all you had all their money in
your hands, the whole $100,000.

156
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,652
And Mexico so near, you could be there.

157
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,560
And you bargain like a woman
and end with a lousy $5,000...

158
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,461
selling yourself to the law.

159
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,223
It might be lousy, Carrincha, but it's legal.

160
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,326
Yeah, but if I, just imagine...

161
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:15,701
I plan this robbery, carry it out, get
my money and you come along to stop me.

162
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,874
A knife like that would be better as a friend.

163
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,076
If it's friends you want...

164
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,312
- would you like to have two?
- Two?

165
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,484
Hey, Alley Cat.

166
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,292
Oh, don't you like him?

167
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,231
Hey.

168
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,344
How about that? All right?

169
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:15,955
This way.

170
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,311
Sign here.

171
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:49,395
A new man who blows into town
and already has picked up $5,000...

172
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,692
is interesting.

173
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,233
Number seven.

174
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,642
It's the best in the house. Next door to mine.

175
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,169
- You staying on long?
- Just passing through.

176
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,213
You never know.

177
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,685
You passing through, too?

178
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:14,581
Yeah.

179
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,062
Sabata.

180
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,540
I don't hardly recognize you anymore.

181
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,169
Because of the safe?

182
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,973
And if you were in my shoes,
what would you have done?

183
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,074
Me?

184
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,515
I'd have kept the money.

185
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,359
You were out of tempo.

186
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,536
Stengel, this time you made a mistake.

187
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:45,549
Trying to steal $100,000 from the Army
to buy land...

188
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,912
that the railroad must purchase
to come through.

189
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,150
All because of your greediness
and to satisfy your mania for grandeur...

190
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,725
you took this foolhardy step.

191
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,263
The risk was too great to take.

192
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:06,267
I'm dishonored by all this, of course.
And so is Ferguson.

193
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,431
Aren't you?

194
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,607
All I know is, I'm leaving this town.

195
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,334
No.

196
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,044
The Colonel won't drop this whole thing.
He'll investigate, of course.

197
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,381
And he'll start right at the top.

198
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,587
Just a minute, Judge O'Hara.

199
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,068
You are never leaving Daugherty.

200
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,639
Stengel, don't.

201
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,705
All right.

202
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,313
That's better.

203
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,187
You'll be here with the rest.

204
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,357
- Well, l...
- Oswald...

205
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,123
I want the Virginian Brothers
and their wagon taken care of.

206
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,187
Yeah.

207
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,988
- It didn't go so well, Oswald?
- Bad business.

208
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,219
Which is exactly why I'm here.

209
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,495
- But we did our part like we said.
- Oh, yeah.

210
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,260
Don't worry, my boss always pays up.

211
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,052
- Oswald?
- Yeah.

212
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,922
- Got to get rid of that wagon.
- I sent three men.

213
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,285
They know how to get rid of it.

214
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,531
Hey, what are you thinking so hard about?

215
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,367
A seesaw and an acrobat,
you get into the bank.

216
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,903
- Acrobat?
- The upper window.

217
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,372
You cash the Army reward and get out.
Don't look for trouble.

218
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,238
Those acrobats took part in that robbery.

219
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,744
And then disappeared.

220
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:51,858
Hey.

221
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,341
- Get away from that wagon.
- Who the hell are you?

222
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,538
Could be your pallbearer?

223
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,674
- He's one of Stengel's men.
- That makes it all clear.

224
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,059
Come in.

225
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,044
"All men gifted with superior talent...

226
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,544
"and thus with superior powers...

227
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,283
"must command...

228
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,921
"and use inferior men."

229
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,261
- Well?
- It's all been done.

230
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:31,254
So the Virginian Brothers
and the men from St. Louis are dead.

231
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:37,164
You're the only person
who knows about the robbery.

232
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,167
But are you safe?

233
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,702
I won't talk.

234
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,676
Four chances, Oswald.

235
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,656
Three to depart.

236
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,026
One to stay.

237
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,365
Hey, cut it out, Stengel.

238
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,736
You won't play? You want the alternative.

239
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,801
All right.

240
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,978
You don't really think anyone like you
can put one over on me.

241
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,019
Oswald...

242
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,657
I like living at the peak of excitement.

243
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,924
For life is only worthwhile...

244
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,867
when you can face death
without showing any fear.

245
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,430
In fact, I enjoy it.

246
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,849
600 feet! That's impossible.

247
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,019
A wise man keeps his distance.

248
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,749
Stengel...

249
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,924
that acrobat's wagon
is positive evidence against you.

250
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,591
So if you'd like to have it,
it'll cost you $10,000.

251
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,893
Come here and you'll get them.

252
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,829
I'm coming.

253
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,160
Stengel...

254
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,129
don't try any tricks!

255
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,972
You'll be shooting at the wind!

256
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,808
Don't shoot at ghosts, Stengel.

257
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,917
Don't shoot at the wind!

258
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,802
You shouldn't have done that, Stengel.

259
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,502
Now the price is $20,000.

260
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,590
Hey.

261
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,035
Now where the devil did he go?

262
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,475
There he is.

263
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,984
You really gave them a run for their money.

264
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,656
I haven't budged from here.

265
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,762
You better keep your horse tied up, then.

266
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,362
Or else people might say:

267
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,805
"He's been up,
playing around with his fillies again."

268
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,832
Where're you going now?

269
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,693
To play around.

270
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,034
- Hey, Sabata, the Alley Cat?
- We better be off then.

271
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,632
- I got a feeling he needs us.
- Right.

272
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,071
Alley Cat's done it again.

273
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,312
London, Paris...

274
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,450
I dream about them.

275
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,026
Ever since I was a kid.

276
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,657
And I still do.

277
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,769
A better life...

278
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,210
and money.

279
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:35,474
That's all we need to get us out of here.

280
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,389
Eh, Banjo?

281
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,730
If you'd gotten your hands on that money,
we'd be on our way to Europe now.

282
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:50,324
You and I together.
Always together. Always.

283
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,904
- No!
- Banjo, what's the matter? Are you sick?

284
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,316
- No, it's nothing. I was dreaming.
- Yeah, dreams, dreams.

285
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,783
We're a great pair, you and me.

286
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:14,023
At least I've always got something
I can make money on.

287
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,855
You strumming away on that stupid banjo.

288
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,695
The sun's up.

289
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,308
Where are you going?

290
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,608
Banjo?

291
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,546
See you.

292
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,592
Hi.

293
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,972
Can't tell you like that.

294
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,177
How much is what you want to tell me
gonna cost?

295
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,785
$200.

296
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,696
I had a run-in in Denver
and they're looking for me.

297
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:37,298
That's why I'm here.
I know everything that goes on in this town.

298
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,342
Stengel doesn't want to pay that $20,000.

299
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,944
He doesn't?

300
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,005
How would you know?

301
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,318
Women talk a lot when they're making love.

302
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:56,649
The fact is, not even Judge O'Hara
or Ferguson will pay.

303
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,989
Oh, yeah?

304
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,924
They figure your demands...

305
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,798
are going to go higher and higher.

306
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,835
Like everything that was in that safe,
maybe?

307
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,247
What are you getting at?

308
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,074
I'm not getting at anything. It's your idea.

309
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,354
It's too risky.
And you don't want a partnership.

310
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,384
You owe me $200.

311
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,143
Being around is useful.

312
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,360
Sorry, lady.

313
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:44,253
If Stengel wanted to invite me to supper,
why didn't he come right out and say so?

314
00:45:22,355 --> 00:45:25,085
You are here because that's what I wanted.

315
00:45:25,158 --> 00:45:26,853
Stengel, sit down.

316
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,155
That $20,000 I wanted isn't enough.

317
00:45:39,505 --> 00:45:41,200
I'd like to get a hold of more money.

318
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:47,272
But you won't like it. That's too bad.

319
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:52,441
But business is business.

320
00:45:53,152 --> 00:45:54,813
Now it's $30,000.

321
00:45:54,887 --> 00:45:56,878
$30,000?

322
00:45:58,858 --> 00:46:01,349
But you can buy all of Texas for that.

323
00:46:01,928 --> 00:46:05,364
Well, hardly,
but that does seem to be your intention.

324
00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:12,402
Now, you're obviously interested
in buying land...

325
00:46:12,472 --> 00:46:15,134
that will soon be worth twice as much.

326
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:19,442
Because sooner or later
the railroad will be passing over it.

327
00:46:20,546 --> 00:46:23,811
So, shall we agree the price is settled?

328
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:34,690
It's not worth it, Stengel.

329
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,125
If I don't get out of here alive...

330
00:46:36,195 --> 00:46:38,288
Col. Rafferty will be informed
of everything.

331
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:57,281
Take the $30,000 to Judge O'Hara.

332
00:47:01,287 --> 00:47:03,881
You've got until 8:00 in the morning.

333
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,789
Very generous.

334
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,359
I think so.

335
00:47:24,243 --> 00:47:27,474
You see, Banjo,
I told you not to worry about him.

336
00:47:27,547 --> 00:47:31,176
I know this hombre.
I said he'd be back. Where's my money?

337
00:47:36,155 --> 00:47:38,453
Soon there'll be enough cash for everyone.

338
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:42,184
All I got to do is believe in you, right?

339
00:47:42,261 --> 00:47:44,889
You don't trust Sabata?
What do you think they'll do?

340
00:47:44,964 --> 00:47:47,558
Nothing. I'm waiting.

341
00:48:26,038 --> 00:48:29,474
You better walk
or I may have to pay for your funeral.

342
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,644
The only man who could betray us
to the Army was Oswald...

343
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,187
and he's been eliminated.

344
00:48:42,655 --> 00:48:46,386
No reason to fear anybody.
That man has no proof against us.

345
00:48:46,826 --> 00:48:50,227
You're wrong, Ferguson.
He knows everything about us.

346
00:48:50,296 --> 00:48:52,161
I know what I'm saying.

347
00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:54,756
If he is a government official, then...

348
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,390
He's nothing.

349
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:59,161
He's a drifter who's after our money.

350
00:48:59,405 --> 00:49:01,532
First, $10,000, now $30,000...

351
00:49:03,509 --> 00:49:05,670
It'll cost a lot less to get rid of him.

352
00:49:05,878 --> 00:49:08,108
What we need is somebody
from the outside.

353
00:49:09,515 --> 00:49:11,506
I think I know somebody.

354
00:49:12,184 --> 00:49:13,947
Just the right boy.

355
00:49:29,735 --> 00:49:31,600
Sharkey, you filthy slob.

356
00:49:31,671 --> 00:49:34,663
You answer when your mother calls,
understand?

357
00:49:39,578 --> 00:49:40,806
Sharkey!

358
00:49:45,651 --> 00:49:47,710
Sharkey, how long you gonna wait?

359
00:49:47,787 --> 00:49:49,220
I'm expecting you to get the Mallorys.

360
00:49:49,288 --> 00:49:51,779
You better go out right now
and shoot them, you hear?

361
00:49:51,857 --> 00:49:55,884
They stole your woman, didn't they?
And you don't do nothing about it.

362
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:59,453
Listen to me! This whole business must end
or they'll shoot us.

363
00:49:59,532 --> 00:50:01,466
Well, what are you going to do about it?

364
00:50:01,534 --> 00:50:02,558
Why must I stand here...

365
00:50:02,635 --> 00:50:04,933
But it was you who sold her to the Mallorys.

366
00:50:06,939 --> 00:50:10,238
Ain't that something?
You want to get me arrested?

367
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:15,103
Come on, Ma!

368
00:50:17,917 --> 00:50:19,248
Hey, what is this?

369
00:50:21,253 --> 00:50:23,915
I just have a little job for your son.

370
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,589
I'll do the talking.

371
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,593
What'll you pay the boy?

372
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:32,192
$1,000.

373
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,863
Five hundred now...

374
00:50:35,935 --> 00:50:39,393
and the rest when the job is done.

375
00:50:41,707 --> 00:50:44,073
What are you waiting for? Go on.

376
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:48,876
And come back today.

377
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:52,311
With the money.

378
00:50:52,384 --> 00:50:56,252
Sharkey, word's gotten around
that you've been drinking a lot.

379
00:50:56,989 --> 00:50:59,480
Alcohol can make your hands shaky.

380
00:51:04,196 --> 00:51:06,130
See those twigs? Watch.

381
00:51:13,439 --> 00:51:15,066
One would have been enough.

382
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:19,977
Mister, I must tell you, till you got here
Daugherty was nice and quiet.

383
00:51:20,346 --> 00:51:22,211
The devil rides with you.

384
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:25,250
I alone don't say it. Ask Padre Brown.

385
00:51:25,317 --> 00:51:26,807
Ask the Alley Cat here.

386
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:52,639
Hey, Sabata.

387
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:02,720
When I stop laughing, you're dead.

388
00:52:36,155 --> 00:52:39,488
Like manure, eh?
Makes the grain grow taller, right?

389
00:52:42,027 --> 00:52:43,688
Just a minute, you.

390
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:47,192
Sheriff, I was there.
It was self-defense, I saw it.

391
00:52:47,266 --> 00:52:49,393
Well, you stick around till I need you.

392
00:52:50,502 --> 00:52:52,265
Hey, wait!

393
00:52:53,305 --> 00:52:55,466
I wonder where he'll end up?

394
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:57,866
And where do you come in?

395
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:01,136
I'm on his side. For the moment.

396
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:04,607
I'm waiting.

397
00:53:09,188 --> 00:53:11,588
I curse my mother who bore me,
and my father...

398
00:53:11,657 --> 00:53:13,955
and my brother and my whole family.

399
00:53:16,428 --> 00:53:18,589
How about? I'll throw it in.

400
00:53:20,065 --> 00:53:21,828
I won it at Richmond.

401
00:53:22,434 --> 00:53:24,026
The Battle of the Seven Days.
