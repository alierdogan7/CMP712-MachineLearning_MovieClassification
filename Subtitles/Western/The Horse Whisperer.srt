[ Laughs ]

1496
02:31:43,751 --> 02:31:45,742
Oh.

1497
02:31:52,060 --> 02:31:56,588
- Dad.
- Honey, you were wonderful.

1498
02:32:23,284 --> 02:32:25,616
Hey there. Gettin' ready
to go home, are ya ?

1499
02:32:25,686 --> 02:32:27,916
Mm-hmm. Is Tom around ?

1500
02:32:27,988 --> 02:32:32,925
No, he went to Sheridan to get
some horses. He left last night.

1501
02:32:35,596 --> 02:32:40,363
Um, when's he coming back ?

1502
02:32:40,434 --> 02:32:43,801
Oh, I don't rightly know.

1503
02:32:43,871 --> 02:32:47,136
Let me know when you need
some help loadin' Pilgrim, okay ?

1504
02:32:47,208 --> 02:32:49,972
Yeah.

1505
02:32:56,050 --> 02:32:59,508
- What time's your flight ?
- 12:15.

1506
02:32:59,587 --> 02:33:03,387
Bookers want to leave
for the airport by 9:30.

1507
02:33:03,457 --> 02:33:06,517
Sure you want to
drive Pilgrim back ?

1508
02:33:06,594 --> 02:33:11,622
Well, I already know the way. It's not
like I have a job to rush home to.

1509
02:33:11,699 --> 02:33:15,897
To tell you the truth,
I could use the time alone.

1510
02:33:16,971 --> 02:33:20,168
When you planning to start ?

1511
02:33:20,241 --> 02:33:24,234
Oh, I guess I'll leave
when you and Grace go.

1512
02:33:24,311 --> 02:33:26,973
May I make a suggestion ?

1513
02:33:27,047 --> 02:33:30,312
What ?

1514
02:33:30,384 --> 02:33:32,443
Take your time.

1515
02:33:34,522 --> 02:33:38,458
What's the matter ?
You look like there's something wrong.

1516
02:33:40,494 --> 02:33:43,793
I'll tell you something, Annie.

1517
02:33:43,864 --> 02:33:46,230
I stood there
looking at that horse,

1518
02:33:46,300 --> 02:33:49,428
and I swear I felt like
the same thing was happening to me.

1519
02:33:51,739 --> 02:33:55,140
And I have two choices.

1520
02:33:55,209 --> 02:33:59,873
I can either fight
the way things are...

1521
02:33:59,947 --> 02:34:02,711
or accept them.

1522
02:34:03,784 --> 02:34:07,117
See, um,

1523
02:34:07,188 --> 02:34:10,919
I always knew
I loved you more.

1524
02:34:10,991 --> 02:34:13,585
Didn't bother me.

1525
02:34:13,661 --> 02:34:19,099
I guess I felt kind of lucky,
a little amazed that...

1526
02:34:19,166 --> 02:34:24,695
a woman like you would want
to be with a man like me.

1527
02:34:24,772 --> 02:34:27,832
And I guess I thought
if I could do everything right--

1528
02:34:27,908 --> 02:34:31,344
If I could-- If I was the best husband
I could be, the best father,

1529
02:34:31,412 --> 02:34:35,212
even being a good lawyer only mattered
because of what it meant for us.

1530
02:34:35,282 --> 02:34:39,616
If I could do all that,
it wouldn't make any difference...

1531
02:34:39,687 --> 02:34:43,851
if we loved each other
the same or not.

1532
02:34:43,924 --> 02:34:46,916
I didn't ask for more.

1533
02:34:46,994 --> 02:34:51,090
I told myself
I didn't need any more.

1534
02:34:51,165 --> 02:34:54,657
But...

1535
02:34:54,735 --> 02:35:00,401
the truth is, you don't
know how you feel about me.

1536
02:35:02,176 --> 02:35:06,442
You don't know if you want
a life with me anymore.

1537
02:35:08,949 --> 02:35:13,283
And the truth is...

1538
02:35:13,354 --> 02:35:16,380
I don't want you to come
home until you do know...

1539
02:35:18,792 --> 02:35:20,783
one way or the other.

1540
02:35:21,862 --> 02:35:23,796
Okay ?

1541
02:36:05,639 --> 02:36:08,506
- Thanks, Joe.
- Yep.

1542
02:36:15,950 --> 02:36:19,511
Bye, Annie.
Good luck to ya.

1543
02:36:19,586 --> 02:36:23,989
Thank you.
And you too.

1544
02:36:26,093 --> 02:36:28,391
All right, everybody in.
Frank, we all set ?

1545
02:36:28,462 --> 02:36:30,396
I believe so.

1546
02:36:30,464 --> 02:36:32,432
I can't believe he's
not here to say good-bye.

1547
02:36:32,499 --> 02:36:34,763
[ Frank ] Oh, he probably
got held up is all.

1548
02:36:34,835 --> 02:36:39,636
[ Diane ] No, sweetie, the truth is,
he's not real good at good-byes.

1549
02:36:39,707 --> 02:36:43,643
You know, come to think of it,
not too good at hellos either.

1550
02:36:43,711 --> 02:36:45,838
- You ready ?
- Just a second.

1551
02:36:49,483 --> 02:36:51,883
- Mmm !
- When will you be home ?

1552
02:36:51,952 --> 02:36:55,581
- Oh, in a few days.
- I'll miss you.

1553
02:36:55,656 --> 02:36:58,750
Well, if I get lost, you know
where to send the search party.

1554
02:36:58,826 --> 02:37:02,523
- Could be just about anywhere.

1555
02:37:02,596 --> 02:37:04,689
I'll call you, okay ?

- [ Engine Starts ]
- Bye.

1557
02:37:09,536 --> 02:37:11,470
Bye.

[ Gate Creaks, Closes ]

1559
02:39:43,423 --> 02:39:47,519
He goin' back inside the trailer
or runnin' alongside it ?

1560
02:39:57,771 --> 02:40:00,103
I just wanted to be here
when you left.

1561
02:40:03,076 --> 02:40:05,567
I don't want to leave you.

1562
02:40:05,646 --> 02:40:08,638
I don't want you to.

1563

[ Crying ]
Just a few more days.

1564
02:40:15,355 --> 02:40:19,758
- And then ?
- Oh.

1565
02:40:27,801 --> 02:40:29,735
Why did this happen ?

1566
02:40:32,005 --> 02:40:34,599
I don't ask
those questions, Annie.

1567
02:40:34,675 --> 02:40:36,609
And I didn't ask
to love you, but I do.

1568
02:40:36,677 --> 02:40:41,171
- Oh !
- I'll always have that with me.

1569
02:40:45,185 --> 02:40:47,176
Tom.

1570
02:40:58,165 --> 02:41:02,465
Can we go for
one last ride, hmm ?

1571
02:41:05,272 --> 02:41:10,195
Yeah. I'll saddle 'em up.
