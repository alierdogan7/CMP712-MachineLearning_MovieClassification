It's important.

184
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,571
Right, right, right, because
whatever problem you've got,

185
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,614
it's always the most important
problem in the world.

186

to thank for that.

They didn't kick you out
because of me.

194
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,712
It didn't help that you filed
three formal complaints.

You got forced out by fales,
didn't you?

196
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,843
That shithead
was working narcotics

197
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,104
and saw that dead methhead
as his chance

198
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,640
to force his way
into a better job in homicide.

199
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,103
So, you were still
on the case

200
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,688

was found?

201
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,524
Yeah.

202
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,071
Fales is ambitious,

203
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,399
and I think he's more interested
in closing cases

204
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,154
than solving them
correctly.

205
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,909
I think fales is trying
to railroad an innocent man.

00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,017
I think that's him.

355
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,852
I will get some rope.

356
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,062
Hopefully,
we can lift out the casket.

357
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,656
Walt!

[Siren wailing]

359
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,623
Thank God you're here.

360
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,129
Who are you?

361
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:56,043
Sheriff.
Absaroka county, Wyoming.

362
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,043
I've been chasing this guy
for weeks.

363
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,800
We got a call
from a monitoring company

364
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,803
that one of their guys
skipped parole.

365
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,227
Henry standing bear.
This is him.

366
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,272
This guy's been robbing graves
all over my county for weeks.

367
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,478
Couldn't catch him in the act,
though.

368
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,561
Why does he have
two shovels?

369
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,317
I just asked the smartass
the same question.

370
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,326
You know what he said?

371
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,870
No.

372
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,323
Tell him what you said.

373
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,787
In case
one of them breaks.

374
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,930
Well, I'd be glad
to take him off your hands,

375
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,932
but I could use your help.

376
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,434
With what?

377
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,187
Well, this psychopath
has gotten away

378
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,513
with stealing 10 bodies.

379
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,190
No evidence.

380
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,772
Now, this casket could be
the difference

381
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,604
between him going to jail
and walking free.

382
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,661
Okay, here we go.

[Lid creaks]

386
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,148
Is it in there?

387
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,202
I don't know.
Take a look.

388
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,037
Me?

389
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,659
Okay,
don't take a look.

390
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,832
Go back to prison
for the rest of your life.

391
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,868
I am concerned about
the chain of custody issues

392
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,499
that the prosecution will
bring up in the trial

393
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:57,830
if I were to --
fine.

394
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,465
You're gonna owe me one.

395
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,170
Only if you find
that feather.

396
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,023
[Grunts]

397
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,787
I guess you owe me one.

1, 2, 3.
[Grunts]

399
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:53,386
Given the up-close-and-personal
nature of the murder,

400
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,600
I'd be surprised
if we didn't find

401
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,640
some of David ridges' DNA
on this guy.

402
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,978
Another good reason for me

403
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,393
not to be the one
to touch the body.

404
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,569
Oh, good point.

405
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,858
Hey, sheriff.
Where have you been?

406
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,704
Ferg, where's ridges?

407
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,536
Gone.
Didn't you know?

408
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,745
How can he be gone?

409
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,000
This door's
supposed to be locked.

410
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,331
Yeah,
I think someone picked it.

411
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,622
I just lifted some prints
from the door.

412
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,586
Someone stole a corpse?

413
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,625
I know.
Pretty sick, right?

414
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,715
So, what do you have here?

415
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:32,058
Less than we thought if
we don't get ridges' body back.

Taillight's out.

419
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,224
It wasn't 10 seconds ago.

420
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,185
You mind popping
that trunk?

421
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,639
Yes, I do.

422
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,308
Pop the trunk, Jacob.

423
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,852
What are you expecting
to find back there, moretti?

424
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,812
A dead body?

425
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,898
Yeah, actually.

426
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,867
Someone stole
David ridges' body.

427
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,741
Maybe someone wanting
to destroy evidence.

428
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,370
And you are the only person
outside of our department

429
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,250
who knew David ridges
was dead.

430

Everybody thought
he was dead.

00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,166
You know what I mean.

432
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,962
I don't have to do this,
and yet somehow,

433
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,254
I'm starting to enjoy racking up
the harassment claims

434

against your department.

Step out of the car,
please.

Who else did you tell
about David ridges

00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,001
besides Sam poteet?

we can count on that?

So, what do you think
of the new uniform?

A little overdressed,
truth be told,

453

but I do like
the attitude.

What do you want to do?
I don't know.

Maybe I should get caught up
on what it is you do.

I'm a little shaky
on the details.

458
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,760
All right, we got an empty
office right down the hall.

459

I'll have my girl get you
squared away in there

460

and bring you decks
on all our current projects.

461
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,800
Shouldn't I get to know
past projects, too?

462
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,224
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Good idea.

00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,776
he was wearing
an ankle monitor.

467
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,161
I'll see that the court
is made aware of this

468
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,321
as soon as possible.

473
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,929
Poteet goes to the hospital
and picks a lock?

474
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,012
And gets rid of evidence linking
nighthorse to ridges' crimes.

476
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:46,891
What?

477
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,931
It's Latin
for "produce the body."

478
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,226
I can't prove ridges is the
murderer if I don't have ridges.

479
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,232
So, where would poteet
take him?

480
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:59,283
To Sam poteet and his friends,
David is not a criminal.

481
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,277
He's a warrior.

482
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,992
They will take him
to a battlefield.

00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,031
Do you know which one?

484
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,617
I have a good guess.

485
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,290
Oral tradition says

486
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,998
that the last dog soldier
in this part of the country

487
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,508
fought his last battle
near copley flats.

488

[Singing in native language]

489
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,213
He had five warriors with him.

490
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,725
An army of 100 white men
surrounded them.

491
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,812
They fought to the death.

492
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,276
I think that is where
they will take David.

493
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,904
Sam poteet.

494
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,824
Put him down.

495
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,002
We plan to.
In the earth.

496
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,587
I can't let you do that.

497
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,506
I understand you need
to bury a fallen brother,

498
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,681
and I promise you
I will let you in due time.

499
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,227
But today, I need him.

500
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,670
I can't have that.
Not now.

501
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,209
And you do not need it.

502
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,630
Is that him?

503
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,843
Yeah.
That's a.D.A. Sloan.

505
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,432

00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,789
Mr. Sloan, thank you
for making the trip.

508
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,993
Detective fales, I'm surprised
to see you here.

509
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,036
When I heard
Henry standing bear

510
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,001
was going
to make a statement,

511
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,382
I just couldn't pass up
the opportunity

512
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,713
or one of his burgers.

513
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,174
Sloan: Detective fales
is my chief investigator.

514
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,964
Do you have any objection
to his presence?

515
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,799
No. It's fine.

516
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,565
Why don't you both
sit there?

517
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,154
The sheriff
is gonna join us.

518
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,073
Do you have any objection
to his presence?

519
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,575
Actually --
before you answer that,

520
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,616
I have a confession
of my own to make.

521
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,702
Henry's not making
a statement.

522
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,408
Do you know how long
of a drive we made?

523
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,745
About five hours, give or take.

524
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,879
Why are we here,
miss longmire?

525
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,506
Two weeks ago,
Mr. Sloan said

526
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,043
that he would take
the death penalty off the table

527
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,506
if my client
pled guilty.

528
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:06,921
I'd like to make
a counter offer.

529
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,304
I know you're not
terribly experienced,

530
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,932
but we're not interested
in any counter offer.

531
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,308
I listened to your offer.

532
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,593
The least you can do
is listen to hers.

533
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,014
Fine. What?

534
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,855
We will sign a binding agreement
right here,

535
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,279
stating that we will not bring
a civil suit against your office

536
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:28,234
if you agree to drop all charges
against Henry today.

537
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,069
What universe
are you living in?!

538
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,658
don't get emotional,
Mr. Sloan.

539
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,330
My daughter's
not done talking.

540
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,912
You see, Mr. Sloan,
the Denver police

541
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,921
had key physical evidence
in this case,

542
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,423
and they suppressed it.

543
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,380
Oh, this is
my favorite part.

544
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,714
Excuse me?

545
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,095
The part when the trial date
is so close

546
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,975
and the client is so guilty
that the lawyer just starts

547
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,602
throwing wads of toilet
paper at the ceiling

548
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,388
to see if she can't get one
to stick.

549
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,315
No toilet paper
in this case.

550
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:05,354
Just a feather found in the
victim's mouth and, in fact,

551
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,656
listed on your initial
search warrant.

552
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:11,531
A piece of random garbage
found in a shallow grave!

553
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,321
Shoved so far down
the victim's throat

554
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,746
that it's still there.

555
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,165
Sloan:
That white line?

556
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:28,211
The real thing is with
the corpse in our local morgue.

557
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,299
Cady: Along with the corpse
who put him there --

558
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,839
David ridges.

559
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:36,306
Oh, so, you finally trumped up
an alternate suspect!

560
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,845
Yes,
a man who put a feather

561
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,809
in the bullet wound
of a local deputy

562
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,815
and who very recently
attempted to murder my dad.

563
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,942
We actually have his car
impounded.

564
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:46,903
For a week and a half,

565
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,528
we've had crime-scene techs
from Cheyenne

566
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,531
combing over every inch
of that car.

567
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,866
And guess what?

568
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,830
They found a hair
that matched Miller Beck,

569
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:06,127
and they also found skin under
the fingernails of Mr. Beck

570
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:10,427
that matched the real
murderer -- David ridges.

571
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,504
Miller Beck fought back.

572
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,181
Scratched his assailant.

573
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,138
Walt:
That's a hard detail to miss,

574
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,850
especially for an experienced
detective like Mr. fales,

575
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,811
but when your autopsy
only lasts 14 minutes,

576
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:24,940
you miss a lot.

577
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,773
Cady: Anyway, yeah.

578
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:30,981
We can go to trial,
and all of this will come out,

579
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,238
and you will lose, and reporters
will write stories about it,

580
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,153
and then we'll sue you.

581
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,573
Or you can just drop
the charges today.

582
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,672
Walk me through the whole
feather thing again.

583
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,314
Your support helped Henry
get through this.

584
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,271
And, well, Henry --
Henry should be here very soon.

585
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,197
As you can imagine,

586
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,322
news that all charges
against Henry have been dropped

587
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,909
is both wonderful
and overwhelming.

588
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:26,040
Henry will be here very soon
to celebrate with all of us.

589

590
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,508

the jukebox full of quarters,

591
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,142
so enjoy.

<i>Sorry we're not here
to take your call.</i>

<i>Please leave a message.</i>

to call you back.</i>

603
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:36,922
Well, this is where I said,
"till death do us part."

604
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,179
Nearly screwed my lines up then.

605
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,722
I screwed up a lot of things.

606
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,605
I should have done this
a long time ago.

607
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,276
But I couldn't.

608
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:59,189
I thought if I kept you up there
on the kitchen shelf,

609
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,991
well, you could keep me in line.

610
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,738
[Chuckles]

611
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,825
That didn't work out so well.

612
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,458
So...

613
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,209
I think maybe it's time
to let you go.

614
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,508
Yeah.

615
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,762
[Breathing unevenly]

[ Sobbing ]

617
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:44,302
Sorry, sweetheart.
It's so hard.

618
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:53,728
I know now that Jacob nighthorse
took you from me.

619
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,899
You could probably find a way
to forgive him.

620
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,733
But I can't.

621
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,283
Hope you can find a way
to forgive me, Martha.

622
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:23,421
At least now you don't have
to see what I'm about to do.

623
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:35,182
How you settling in to that job
in the real world?

624
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,596
Everybody's been great.

625
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:38,060
I've just been thinking.

626
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,769
Not too much, I hope.

627

you pay big pines timber

628
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,066

629
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,944

He owns it.

633
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,538
I'm sorry
I brought up work.

634
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:02,838
Your turn.

635
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,879
You said you do
as little business

636
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,590
with nighthorse
as possible.

637
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,430
That seems like
a lot of business.

638
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,471
Pull.

639
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:24,023
Especially when you have
another lumber supplier.

640
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,280
You got something
to ask me, just ask.

641
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,035
I'm just trying
to figure out

642
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:35,785
the exact nature
of your relationship

643
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,915
with a man I thought
was your sworn enemy.

644
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:41,078
Not when it came to getting you
elected sheriff.

645
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,211
What do you mean?

646
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,755
Well, I knew that

647
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:50,338
you wouldn't accept any campaign
money coming from me,

648
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:53,845
so I funneled it through
someone you wouldn't suspect.

649
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,975
Do I hate
the Indian bastard?

650
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,598
Yes.
But he can be useful.

651
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,934
I guess that explains why you
didn't get out of your car

652
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,815
to threaten nighthorse
in that video.

653
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:09,276
'Cause you weren't
really threatening him.

654

You were doing business.

[Chuckles]

00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:24,872
Three years ago, you paid
big pines timber $50,000.

00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,173
What was that for?

659

660
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:33,422
Dad,
that payment happened

661
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,677
the same week
Walt's wife died.

662
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:46,101
I've done a lot of things bad
over the years,

663
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:49,188
but I did every one of them
for our family.

664
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,612
We settled this county,

665
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,565
and we are going to be
the future of it,

666
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,740
whatever it takes.

667
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,909
So, you paid nighthorse,

668
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,664
and he sent ridges
down to Denver?

669
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,575
Nighthorse didn't have
the balls.

670
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:07,918
I paid him to borrow his soldier
just the one time.

671
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,008
No questions asked.

672
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,801
Branch, I did that
for our family.

673
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,427
I did it for you.

674
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:21,060

and you deserved it.
