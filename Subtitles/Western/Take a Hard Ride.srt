1
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,432
Good morning.

2
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:28,277
Good morning, Mr. Garms.

3
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:30,655
After you.

4
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:35,576
Garms!

5
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:41,833
The name is Nesbitt.
You must have the wrong fellow.

6
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:45,920
Oh yeah?

7
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:07,984
We don't care for bounty hunters, Mr.

8
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:11,195
So why don't you just get on your
horse and ride on out?

9
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,658
I don't care what name you call him. Harry
Nesbitt is a good friend of mine.

10
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:19,253
Look, it was along time ago.
I was just a kid.

11
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:20,955
Them days are behind me.

12
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:25,168
I got a whole new life here.
A damn good life.

13
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:27,962
That's just about finished.

14
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:45,599
- They move along good, Mr. Morgan.
- Keep at them.

15
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,919
Hey-up. Hey-up.

16
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:12,770
Hi Kiefer.

17
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,239
So you found them... after all.

18
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:26,617
Yeah. No thanks to you.

19
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:30,204
Sheriff, you knew him?

20
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:34,583
Lots of people around here
thought he was a good man.

21
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:38,379
- A wanted man, that's all that matters.
- To you.

22
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:40,464
To the law.

23
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:46,429
- The law is my business.
- Yeah. But you didn't do it.

24
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:48,973
You don't kill a man for 200 dollars.

25
00:07:49,214 --> 00:07:51,684
Every man has his choice...,
..he made his.

26
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:56,772
One of these days, Kiefer...
...you're gonna go too far.

27
00:07:56,897 --> 00:08:01,485
If I do... it would be for a hell
lot more than this.

28
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,993
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

29
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,002
First time I ever saw you
two move fast.

30
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,923
- What about the bonus?
- You got it.

31
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:25,509
Even though you didn't earn it.

32
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:30,931
- Oh Mr. Pike, Will was really sick.
- Yeah, terrible pain right here.

33
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:32,796
Wouldn't wish it on a rat.

34
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:45,195
Figure .. we deserve a drink too.

35
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:47,698
Well, Pike...

36
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:50,117
Here's to us!

37
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:54,204
My God.. here's to us.

38
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,754
You always knew that we were gonna make it,
Mr. Morgan?

39
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,256
There were times when I wondered.

40
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:09,136
Wondered plenty. Maybe I was
biting off more than I could chew.

41
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,724
- How does it feel to be rich?
- Damned good.

42
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:18,729
But Hell, Pike, this money
is for all of us down in Sonora.

43
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:20,898
We're gonna do things down there.

44
00:09:21,023 --> 00:09:24,360
All those things we have been
talking about all those years.

45
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:28,572
That sounds mighty good to me.

46
00:09:29,907 --> 00:09:34,286
We're gonna make us a place where everybody
can live...

47
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:39,833
...without anybody to tell us
what to think, what to do.

48
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:44,922
A place where a man can be what he is.

49
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,899
Some good folks down in
Sonora, Mr. Morgan.

50
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:55,933
- Best I've ever met.
- Well, Pike, that is your home now.

51
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,770
You're as much a part of the
Morgan ranch as I am.

52
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:07,861
Mrs Linda Morgan, ranch
Dos Rios, Sonora, Mexico.

53
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:13,033
Everything is fine here. Stop.
Coming home with Pike. Stop.

54
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:15,828
Your loving husband, Bob Morgan.

55
00:10:15,953 --> 00:10:18,247
- How long is that going to take?
- Not long at all.

56
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:21,792
She ought to have it in a day or so.

57
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,880
Get this out a soon as you can, will you?

58
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:31,439
- Can we send this right now?
- I will take care of it.

59
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:36,865
- Well, she knows we're headed home now, sir.
- Yeah. Yeah she ought to.

60
00:10:36,963 --> 00:10:39,201
What is it?

61
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:42,280
It must be.. I am little tired.

62
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:46,316
- I'll take you to the hotel.
- No, just give me a minute.

63
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:53,198
Take it easy, Mr. Morgan.

64
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,909
No time, Pike.

65
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,579
You listen.

66
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:04,293
No one but you.. you are gonna
get that money back to the ranch.

67
00:11:04,418 --> 00:11:07,421
All the people are... counting on you.

68
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:10,173
You are going back, Mr. Morgan.

69
00:11:10,924 --> 00:11:13,468
Give me your word, Pike!

70
00:11:14,469 --> 00:11:16,346
Give me your word.

71
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:21,727
No matter what happens... you get that
money back down there.

72
00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:24,813
Everything depends on that.

73
00:11:24,938 --> 00:11:26,857
For everybody.

74
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:30,360
All our plans...

75
00:11:30,944 --> 00:11:33,196
You got my words.

76
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:36,867
- Then I...
- Mr. Morgan?

77
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:32,506
Card?

78
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:48,605
Well, Mister dealer,

79
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:52,859
I certainly would call this a fine hand.

80
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:57,531
Lacking only one thing which, I
trust, you will now deliver unto me.

81
00:12:57,967 --> 00:13:00,617
What the Hell are you talking about?

82
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:03,286
One card, sir.

83
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:07,457
Three.

84
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:10,961
And one for the dealer.

85
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,382
Ah.. one.

86
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:19,052
I believe one of you gentlemen
have the bet.

87
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:22,806
Here's your two. I'll
push you for two more.

88
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:26,092
Your name wouldn't happen to be Pike?

89
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:32,816
I've been called a lot of things, sir
But that ain't one of them.

90
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,319
Thought it might be my lucky day.

91
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:42,033
Do you know that buck that's
driving to Sonora?

92
00:13:42,158 --> 00:13:45,745
The one with 86,000 dollars.

93
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:50,709
You tryin' to tell me that story
about the Morgan payroll is true?

94
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,628
I swear, Mr.
My cousin Billy's seen it.

95
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:56,756
Play the God damn cards.

96
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,677
Excuse me.

97
00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:04,014
The man is anxious to give me his money.

98
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:10,437
If you could beat this hand...
...I'll kiss my nose.

99
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:12,355
Ah...

100
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:14,941
- Snake!
- Snake! Kill it! Kill it!

101
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:23,533
Hey come on. What the Hell's going on?

102
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:28,955
Thought we was playing cards?

103
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:39,841
You was telling us about...
kissing your nose?

104
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,969
You would have to have to beat
a king high straight.

105
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:51,728
I guess you better...
...pucker up, man.

106
00:14:56,441 --> 00:14:58,318
Thank you, gentlemen.

107
00:14:59,353 --> 00:15:04,449
Mister. You're the luckiest man alive.
Or the handiest.

108
00:15:04,574 --> 00:15:07,894
- Keep this for me until I get back.
- Where are you going?

109
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:10,747
Fishing.

110
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:16,479
Hey, boy!

111
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:31,786
All we want is a share. We will leave
you plenty.. how about it?

112
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:35,582
Why draw and die? There
is enough for everyone.

113
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:39,586
It's only money. In Hell...
..it ain’t even yours.

114
00:17:01,774 --> 00:17:03,443
Kill the bastard!

115
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:03,363
Hold it. What the hell are you doin'?

116
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:07,014
What are you shooting at?
Wait until you can see him.

117
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:33,282
Look out! Snakes!

118
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:59,027
A man with a cigar in one hand and
a horse in the other can do you no harm.

119
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:04,847
Seems like those fellas back there had you in
a lot of trouble. Figured I saved your hide.

120
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:08,832
Would have it done anyway. All you do
is you save me some time.

121
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,739
You're welcome I'm sure...

122
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:17,577
My momma always taught me manners.

123
00:19:17,702 --> 00:19:19,787
So. How'd yu do.

124
00:19:19,912 --> 00:19:23,666
- My name: Tyree.
- Tyree.

125
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:27,253
Yeah... I've heard of you.

126
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:33,593
That's all I need.

127
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:42,134
I figured it will take some time
to convince you that point, but...

128
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:46,439
...I'm kinda glad you’d see it right off.

129
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:54,614
All I see is a fast talking nigger..
..In a fancy shirt.

130
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:56,918
That it?

131
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:03,321
Why don't you get back on that horse..
Before your ideas get outta hand?

132
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:05,416
I figuring on getting rich too.

133
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,920
But my momma always taught me
to look ahead.

134
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:13,090
Let's say I killed you... took the money...

135
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:17,929
They would just come looking for me.
But you got the right idea...

136
00:20:18,054 --> 00:20:22,975
...make it to Mexico, spend the
rest of your days spending.

137
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,812
- Is that your proposition?
- You got it.

138
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:30,661
We ride together from here to Mexico.

139
00:20:31,308 --> 00:20:34,356
I protect your tail.. you watch mine.

140
00:20:35,738 --> 00:20:40,159
- And when we get there?
- Once we cross that big river..

141
00:20:40,284 --> 00:20:42,344
...all bets are off.

142
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:46,557
- Why should I trust you anymore than them?
- Because they're dead.

143
00:20:46,682 --> 00:20:48,501
And you wanna stay alive.

144
00:20:58,844 --> 00:21:02,807
Dying is way of life for
some people, Tyree.

145
00:21:02,932 --> 00:21:05,935
Make sure you won't have that problem.

146
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,486
You know something, Pike?

147
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:23,828
We are practically... invisible.

148
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:30,109
I mean everyone is out looking for only one darky.
And now there is two of us.

149
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,044
How are they gonna know you now?

150
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,750
You always carry a pack of snakes with you?

151
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:45,126
- That's a story that have never been told.
- Well I've seen you throw snakes...

152
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:49,581
...but can you shoot?
You'll just have to wait to find out.

153
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:36,859
Seems like... somebody’s gotta move.

154
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,948
Seems like.

155
00:22:43,616 --> 00:22:48,829
Now friend...
..we can't tell which side you're moving on.

156
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:52,458
That one or this one?

157
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,711
I haven't made up my mind yet.

158
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:07,389
You ehh..need any help making up your mind?

159
00:23:12,144 --> 00:23:14,146
Never have.

160
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,737
All right.

161
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:45,177
He seemed to want something more
from you than just money.

162
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:12,496
There are they

163
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:15,457
...lets ride after them!

164
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:09,011
- Well what do you think?
- They have shown the way.

165
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:43,879
I still do not know if you can shoot.

166
00:26:10,864 --> 00:26:13,492
Hey, look at them spurs!

167
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:19,775
Yeah.. these two are shot up pretty bad.

168
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,042
I told you that we were
coming up behind Pike.

169
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:25,754
Yep, , and so were they.
This one was married.

170
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:29,174
Too bad his widow ain’t around.

171
00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:38,684
- Are you a gambling man, Pike?
- I do no gambling.

172
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:56,034
Do you think it's going to be
like that all the way, Pike?

173
00:27:05,544 --> 00:27:09,464
What's wrong? Smell of that
money loosing it sweetness?

174
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:15,012
Ahh. It's getting sweeter all the time.
It's just like with a woman, Pike.

175
00:27:15,137 --> 00:27:18,306
Once you start to like them.,
Always hungry.

176
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:25,163
- How about a cigar?
- I do no smokin', neither.

177
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,430
Tell me something. When I'm not near
are you thinking of keeping all that money?

178
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:38,410
- You mean..eh... splitting with you?
- Now, that ain’t a bad idea.

179
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:40,746
Well, don't get your hopes up.

180
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:46,643
You think about it though, don't you Pike? I
mean it wouldn't be natural if you didn't.

181
00:27:46,668 --> 00:27:48,837
You're the same as me.

182
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:54,676
Maybe... before...
..but..it's different now.

183
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,955
I'm just practicing.

184
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,877
I hope so.

185
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:37,210
Oh my darling, Oh my darling.

186
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:42,849
Oh... my dar..ling... Clementine.

187
00:28:42,974 --> 00:28:47,370
You were gone out... Forever.

188
00:28:47,998 --> 00:28:52,567
Dreadful story, Clementine...

189
00:28:57,948 --> 00:28:59,908
Finished?

190
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:02,994
- I am now.
- Let's go.

191
00:29:03,912 --> 00:29:05,580
Please.

192
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:24,015
What the hell are you doing?

193
00:29:28,853 --> 00:29:31,815
Shit, Mr! We ain't got nothing.

194
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,697
- You rode with Pike?
- Yeah, but wasn't the only ones...

195
00:29:34,822 --> 00:29:37,195
...I mean he was a lot better than us.

196
00:29:37,424 --> 00:29:43,402
- But little eyes like you gotta see a lot.
- We didn't see nothing, Mr., I swear.

197
00:29:43,743 --> 00:29:48,540
- Are you going after Pike too?
- I might be just the one that's gonna kill him.

198
00:29:49,124 --> 00:29:52,127
Pike he don't die so easy.

199
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:58,175
The dead is dead, and that's my problem.
You two are gonna ride with me.

200
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,551
Or?

201
00:30:01,886 --> 00:30:04,306
With him.

202
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:11,855
Hey Pike. You know something?
I've been thinking.

203
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,859
I know why I'm risking my hide.
Why are you doing it?

204
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:20,280
- Because I told Morgan I would.
- You gave your word to a white man?

205
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:23,700
Where I come from that ain’t exactly
binding.

206
00:30:23,825 --> 00:30:26,327
Not even 86,000 dollars worth.

207
00:30:28,163 --> 00:30:31,916
I gave my word... to a man.

208
00:30:58,693 --> 00:31:01,362
Help! Arrrgh!

209
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,878
Let go!

210
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:22,550
Come on. Come on!

211
00:31:33,228 --> 00:31:34,813
Lucas!

212
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:53,873
- Stop it! What more do you want?
- Get her.

213
00:31:53,998 --> 00:31:56,835
- Stop it!
- Hold her tight!

214
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,003
Help! No!

215
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:02,757
Feel like being a gentleman?

216
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,405
This your husband?

217
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:17,498
Where were you headed?

218
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:22,045
To a little town, near the Rio Grande.

219
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,840
We're headed that way you can ride with us

220
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:29,719
I'll round up a couple of horses
for you and your friend.

221
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:35,332
One. He doesn't need.
He was raised by the Tarahuma Indians.

222
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:40,504
Two blacks, a women and
Indian on foot.

223
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:43,524
Don't you think anybody is going to
recognize you, Pike?

224
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:47,661
Now that I know you can shoot, Tyree..
..we won't get no problems.

225
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:52,533
What's your name, amigo?

226
00:33:52,992 --> 00:33:57,789
His name is Kashtok. He can not
speak. He has no tongue.

227
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:04,962
Who did that to him?

228
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:08,716
Men.. like those.

229
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:28,111
We do not need him. We can
can catch up Pike by ourselves.

230
00:34:28,236 --> 00:34:31,322
Bushwhack him and keep all the money.

231
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:38,538
He wouldn't give us much anyway.
This way we got it all.

232
00:34:38,663 --> 00:34:41,749
And spend it before he evens knows it.

233
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:56,764
- You haven't seen a nigger riding by?
- Maybe.

234
00:35:02,937 --> 00:35:04,522
Maybe a couple of them.

235
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:07,525
Is that right?

236
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:12,280
- The man says he seen the big nigger.
- Not far up ahead.

237
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,242
Well... that's fine.

238
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:21,414
- Depends on what you got in mind.
- Sounds like you got something in mind, mister?

239
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:25,751
If you're gonna go riding out after him,
you are gonna be riding with me... or..

240
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:28,421
- Or what?
- Or you ain’t riding at all.

241
00:35:28,546 --> 00:35:32,966
- You got some kind of claim on him?
- You could put that way or put it ..

242
00:35:33,115 --> 00:35:35,276
...any way you want it.
I happened to be first in line.

243
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:38,931
Well, he's is going to move over.

244
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:57,491
Thank you.

245
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:03,664
I mean.. for before... what you did.

246
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,709
"Thank you" is very difficult
for you to say isn't it?

247
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:12,500
I don't think I will
be sorry that I said it.

248
00:36:13,702 --> 00:36:17,261
Well, just thought you might like to talk.

249
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:20,514
That depends about what.

250
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,767
I don't know.

251
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:26,354
I thought it might made you feel better.

252
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:29,523
I came from New Orleans.

253
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:32,607
And before that France.

254
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,180
You know about the crypt in New
Orleans, where the girls are?

255
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:37,907
I was there for three years.

256
00:36:38,032 --> 00:36:43,204
Until Lucas, my husband,
came and brought me away with him.

257
00:36:45,623 --> 00:36:48,584
He was a kind and gentle man.

258
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:52,046
Perhaps you can never
understand, but he did.

259
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:55,299
He never asked me about
what it was like there.

260
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,885
He didn't have to know.

261
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:01,153
Lucas made me feel...

262
00:37:01,772 --> 00:37:04,608
Sometimes... almost believed
that it never happened.

263
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:05,809
Almost?

264
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:09,105
Is that so strange?

265
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,984
It can happen that a man can trust you. With those
you are carrying without being no doubt before.

266
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:17,404
Yeah, I know about that.

267
00:37:18,823 --> 00:37:22,026
When my husband found Kashtok
left to die in the desert,..

268
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:24,931
...he brought him home to care for.

269
00:37:25,538 --> 00:37:27,998
Lucas were that kind of person.

270
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:29,924
Sound like you loved him.

271
00:37:31,669 --> 00:37:33,212
No.

272
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:36,507
That was the only thing I
could not give.

273
00:37:36,632 --> 00:37:40,136
I tried, but it was not there.

274
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:46,642
- Perhaps it is something that I have lost.
- Well..maybe you'll find it again.

275
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,188
Where? Back in the crypts of New Orleans?

276
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:53,733
No.

277
00:37:53,858 --> 00:37:58,529
I am not going to chase rainbows
...as they say in your country.

278
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:01,282
- This ain’t my country.
- No?

279
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:04,785
I was told that you
fought a war about that.

280
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:31,562
What's she say?

281
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:37,318
She said that we won the war.

282
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:42,406
Is that so? Why are they still
shooting at us then?

283
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:46,141
If they ever stopped, I
figured something is wrong.

284
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:57,671
She tell you a sad story?

285
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:00,424
What makes you think so?

286
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:05,179
It kinda figures, Pike.

287
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:10,434
I have known a lot of ladies,
Been to a lot of places.

288
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:14,104
Including New Orleans.

289
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:18,526
Everybody got sad story
in their past.

290
00:39:18,651 --> 00:39:21,320
Some people more that others.

291
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:23,530
It ain’t no different.

292
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:26,867
Don't you ever shut up?

293
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:31,766
Talking makes me feel... I'm alive.

294
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:34,124
Lets me know I'm here.

295
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:40,172
You've always been a loner, Pike?

296
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:44,885
You kinda got that look in your eye,
tells people to stay away.

297
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,306
Depends on people.

298
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:55,562
- You don't like me much do you?
- Oh, I like you, Tyree.

299
00:39:55,905 --> 00:39:59,573
But ain’t you the fella that's
gonna try and kill me

300
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:03,102
...when we cross that river into Mexico?

301
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:09,910
Yep..that's right, Pike.

302
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:17,376
I told you that we ain't gonna
find nothin' else.

303
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:20,212
But you're so Goddamn stubborn!

304
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:23,507
But you'll eat rabbits if you get
hungry enough!

305
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:29,054
- So high and mighty.
- I will eat no skunk.

306
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,976
All you have to do...

307
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:38,752
...is to skin it up, wash it, put it on
the fire, call it " prairie dog."

308
00:40:38,877 --> 00:40:42,484
If we wait for the chicken,
we starve to death.

309
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:45,612
- I told you.. I don't eat no skunk.
- Hold it!

310
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:50,409
- Hands up! Where is it?
- I ain’t got it.

311
00:40:51,504 --> 00:40:53,074
Don't make a move.

312
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,494
There were supposed to be only one of them.

313
00:40:55,877 --> 00:40:59,251
The fact is that we are gonna kill
you both in about 3 seconds from now.

314
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,746
- What for?
- The money you got.

315
00:41:01,881 --> 00:41:07,050
What money? We've got 16 cents between us!
But you are welcome to it all...

316
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:12,898
- Only chicken here!
- Chicken? You son of a bitch!

317
00:41:13,023 --> 00:41:17,868
Skunk is good enough for me,
You got a whole Goddamn chicken.

318
00:41:18,003 --> 00:41:20,147
Hey, neither one of them is him.

319
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:23,150
And I'm expecting to see 86,000 dollars.

320
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:24,526
What?

321
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:28,734
What? You mean there's a nigger
riding around with all that money?

322
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,423
That's right.
Too bad you ain’t him.

323
00:41:31,758 --> 00:41:33,243
Come on, let's go!

324
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:44,880
You dumb bastard! We got
better things to do!

325
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:48,759
86,000 dollars!

326
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:01,230
You see, Mr. Kiefer,
Just like we've been telling you.

327
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:06,819
Old Pike he's been this way.
He didn't take nothing off these fellas.

328
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:09,196
Wouldn't take us long.

329
00:42:16,224 --> 00:42:19,851
Lot of stuff here.
He left it all for us.

330
00:42:20,786 --> 00:42:22,216
Ladies things.

331
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:54,783
When are we gonna get him?

332
00:42:55,826 --> 00:43:00,914
Why hurry? They are only carrying the
money closer to where we can spend it.

333
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,536
Cangey! Look!

334
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,876
Come on!

335
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:17,300
Don't let them get away!

336
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:39,838
Come on! We got them now! If we get
across the bridge, we'll be rich men!

337
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:44,994
They did it! Move your ass!

338
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:57,424
Hey!

339
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:11,104
Come on, give me your foot.
Come on.

340
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:15,284
Hold on.
Do you want me to fall down!

341
00:46:15,887 --> 00:46:17,567
I give you my foot!

342
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:22,991
More..more..
Come on. Hurry!

343
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:24,909
Hurry up, come on!

344
00:46:25,034 --> 00:46:28,246
Hold on to my foot.
Hold on to my foot. Don't let go!

345
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:32,208
Hang on. Up with you. No!

346
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:51,144
You came because God sent you here.

347
00:46:51,853 --> 00:46:55,648
He means for me to ride on this crusade.

348
00:46:56,107 --> 00:47:00,236
It's not money, Kiefer, it's what
they plan to do with it.

349
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:01,946
The Devil's work.

350
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:06,201
Ohh, they claim they will be delivering it,
protecting it for others.

351
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:10,372
But we know, don't we Kiefer?
But that's a lie.

352
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:13,833
This is just a test of your purpose.

353
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:18,421
- Like when I first met you at the end of the war.
- That's right.

354
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:21,966
Then called us marauders then, didn't they?

355
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:25,595
Because we no longer obeyed the rules
of war.

356
00:47:27,388 --> 00:47:31,726
But I knew I... I obeyed the rule
of God.

357
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:37,023
- When I took revenge on His enemies.
- It's coming to you again.

358
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,445
And I hear His call.

359
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,534
Well...

360
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:51,120
Listen to me...

361
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:56,709
Do you drink?

362
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:03,132
Do you chew? (Tobacco)

363
00:48:10,526 --> 00:48:12,558
What about women?

364
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:16,396
- What about them?
- Well you know, do you... eh...?

365
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:21,567
They are... sisters in Christ.

366
00:48:25,738 --> 00:48:27,031
Amen, brother.

367
00:48:27,156 --> 00:48:29,325
- Angel.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:37,542
Sent through the Lord,
His own thunderbolt...

369
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:42,213
He been given into my hands to
smite the unredeemable sinners.

370
00:48:42,338 --> 00:48:44,424
Show him, Angel.

371
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:54,401
They are heathens. Black heathens.

372
00:48:54,638 --> 00:48:58,771
Black is the Devil's colors and they
are riding on the Devil's mission.

373
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,778
Goodbye 86,000 dollars.

374
00:49:05,225 --> 00:49:07,080
And it's all your fault.

375
00:49:07,215 --> 00:49:10,450
Because if you done what I told you...

376
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:15,705
All you know to do is give orders
and complaining.

377
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:19,000
The best way for us to
do is just..separate.

378
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:21,919
Oh wait a minute, Cangey.
Don't be that way.

379
00:49:22,044 --> 00:49:24,047
Hey money isn't everything.

380
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:28,843
Hey listen, Come on you know those two
blankets you wanted? I got them here.

381
00:49:28,968 --> 00:49:30,803
Come on.

382
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:39,395
Look out! Run!

383
00:49:41,147 --> 00:49:45,067
Goddamn, Cangey, they killed us!

384
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:05,254
- The money isn't here.
- What?

385
00:50:10,334 --> 00:50:14,614
They looks like them, but there
ain’t 86,000 dollars.

386
00:50:15,332 --> 00:50:16,898
Maybe it's just a story.

387
00:50:17,023 --> 00:50:20,770
No, it's no story.
Everybody knows about it.

388
00:50:21,771 --> 00:50:26,484
- So where's the money?
- We just been following the wrong ones, that's all.

389
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:30,279
But we've been crossing a lot of trails
all leading to the border.

390
00:50:30,404 --> 00:50:32,615
I figure that's where the money is.

391
00:50:33,088 --> 00:50:35,451
All for the the money.

392
00:50:37,828 --> 00:50:40,832
All of a sudden you got big eyes.

393
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:44,252
And I was just figuring you were different.

394
00:50:44,377 --> 00:50:47,004
Thinking about joining up
with the other side?

395
00:50:47,129 --> 00:50:51,551
- Do you believe I think about that?
- Oh, yeah.

396
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:55,325
I forget about your recent bereavement.

397
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:01,394
I hope I don't mind me saying, but..eh
For a fresh widow and all..

398
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:04,730
...you don't seem too broken up.

399
00:51:05,214 --> 00:51:09,235
You would prefer that I cry?
Is that what you mean?

400
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:15,116
I figured a man should always
have someone to weep over him.

401
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:19,620
- Guess I'm just kinda sentimental.
- Tears are not gonna bring my husband back.

402
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:23,508
No, but they do have sanctimonious way.

403
00:51:23,752 --> 00:51:26,726
My momma always taught me manners.

404
00:51:27,837 --> 00:51:31,048
- He's talking too much.
- It doesn't matter.

405
00:51:31,173 --> 00:51:36,220
Well, I don’t wanna going in an up fit.
,..but he do what he likes.

406
00:51:36,345 --> 00:51:40,182
And you? What do you like?
The money you carry?

407
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:42,727
Well, ehh. I'm just holding it.

408
00:51:42,852 --> 00:51:46,314
For a lot of people down in Sonora.
They worked a lot of years for it.

409
00:51:46,439 --> 00:51:50,026
- Are you are taking it to them?
- That's right.

410
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:52,778
I'm sorry, I didn't understand.

411
00:51:53,529 --> 00:51:59,327
- You are a lucky man.
- Well, It didn't seem that way lately.

412
00:51:59,452 --> 00:52:02,612
You found something worth living for

413
00:52:04,457 --> 00:52:06,042
I envy you.

414
00:52:42,953 --> 00:52:44,663
Come on!

415
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:42,721
Come on. We gotta get closer. Come on!

416
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,824
In the cave!

417
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:22,237
Tyree!

418
00:56:56,684 --> 00:56:57,685
Tyree!

419
00:57:35,704 --> 00:57:36,872
Take this.

420
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,546
See if there's a way out.

421
00:59:40,662 --> 00:59:42,831
Come on! Faster!

422
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:46,167
Faster! Faster!

423
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:14,907
Are you crazy?

424
01:02:43,386 --> 01:02:47,724
Next time you get an idea like that, Pike..
..you keep it to yourself.

425
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:50,268
We made it didn't we?

426
01:02:55,273 --> 01:02:57,191
Let's get out of here.

427
01:04:01,506 --> 01:04:05,218
- Why has she done it?
- Something you'll never understand.

428
01:04:05,343 --> 01:04:08,346
- What did you say to her back there?
- I said nothing.

429
01:04:08,888 --> 01:04:11,812
'Cause she are just looking
for a reason to live.

430
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:15,558
Well, she found one...
.. good enough to die for.

431
01:04:27,824 --> 01:04:30,201
No, no good.

432
01:04:57,645 --> 01:05:00,231
Guess he ain’t no where to go.

433
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:07,530
You haven't come up against them yet.
So you don't know.

434
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:11,742
But I do. Also know what you're after,
Kane.

435
01:05:12,243 --> 01:05:14,370
It's not exactly within the law.

436
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,725
What we are after is none of your business.

437
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:20,305
- Your are not wearing your badge anymore, Kane.
- I don't go anywhere with you.

438
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:21,627
You are damn slight smarter.

439
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:24,130
When did you start sharing your bounty?

440
01:05:24,255 --> 01:05:27,175
This time I'll be making an exception.

441
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:30,803
Sounds like you're the one
that need help, not me.

442
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:35,224
Two niggers and an Indian.
I can handle that myself.

443
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:39,270
I've already buried a dozen
men that said the same thing.

444
01:05:40,021 --> 01:05:43,314
Equal shares to every man
who rides with me.

445
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:46,527
You got a few minutes
to make up your minds.

446
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:50,228
You can't have my men, Kiefer.

447
01:05:51,657 --> 01:05:54,160
That's for them to decide.

448
01:05:54,285 --> 01:05:57,788
It wouldn't be safe to go on without me.

449
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:03,711
- Is that a threat?
- That's a fact.

450
01:06:30,588 --> 01:06:33,783
They shot our wagon to shit...

451
01:06:33,908 --> 01:06:35,576
Goddamn!

452
01:06:39,205 --> 01:06:41,499
Won't you ever get tired?

453
01:06:41,624 --> 01:06:44,544
You never told me about it.

454
01:06:44,669 --> 01:06:48,839
Save your breath, Tyree.
You're gonna need it.

455
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:52,510
We are gonna make it.

456
01:06:56,305 --> 01:06:59,183
Do you hear me? We are gonna make it!

457
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:03,104
Yeah. We... are in the middle of nowhere..

458
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:08,150
Not even a Goddamn horse and he
he says we're gonna make it.

459
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:12,697
You are seeing butterflies.
Women with... laces.

460
01:07:13,698 --> 01:07:14,865
Hey.

461
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:16,784
What?

462
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:18,953
Look. Look!

463
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:09,879
- You son of a bitch!
- The men have a right to decide for themselves, Kane.

464
01:08:10,004 --> 01:08:12,173
They decided to ride with me.

465
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,875
What are you gonna do?

466
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:11,231
I meet up with you in Calvera's camp.

467
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:19,073
Are you sure you don't wanna try some?
I don't chew.

468
01:09:22,368 --> 01:09:25,412
Calvera's camp. Good.

469
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:30,084
Good mexican food.

470
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:52,525
Hey, Chico, how are you doing? You learned
how to handle that buck I got for you?

471
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:53,691
Yes, sir.

472
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,695
Hello, old man.
It's been a long walk, right?

473
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:59,363
Yeah.

474
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:04,643
- Do you have two good horses we could buy?
- At least you can ride them.

475
01:10:14,545 --> 01:10:17,881
Hey, Tyree, there's one for you.

476
01:10:30,978 --> 01:10:35,149
Hey Tyree, I think you better
try that one..

477
01:10:38,444 --> 01:10:42,031
Well, old man, how much are you
gonna charge these two miserable thieves?

478
01:10:42,156 --> 01:10:43,998
They are probably stolen anyway.

479
01:10:44,123 --> 01:10:47,223
Like only a horse thief would know, senor.

480
01:11:04,092 --> 01:11:08,625
- This one needs a shoe. We won't get far that way.
- There is a blacksmith in town.

481
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,059
I'll tend to it myself, Chico.

482
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:12,853
Is there a any place in this
town where we can eat and drink?

483
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:15,606
Only for those who can pay for it.

484
01:11:15,731 --> 01:11:18,711
Well, that ain’t no problem,
just see my friend there.

485
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:39,963
Where the Hell is that
indian going this time?

486
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:40,857
Tequila?

487
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:26,778
- You killed many men with this?
- Only if they shot at me first.

488
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:32,576
- I wish.. I wish I had a gun.
- Why? Who're you gonna shoot?

489
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:38,415
The man who killed my father.

490
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:18,705
What are you doing out here, Chico?

491
01:14:23,043 --> 01:14:25,128
I followed you, senor.

492
01:14:25,486 --> 01:14:27,371
Well, you better be going
back to the house now

493
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:29,516
before you get in trouble
with your grandfather.

494
01:14:29,517 --> 01:14:34,479
He is not my grandfather.
I just work for him. I have no one.

495
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:41,524
It's past your bedtime.

496
01:16:57,405 --> 01:17:01,117
I never remembered you for 10 years, Pike.

497
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:04,412
Well, that took you long enough.

498
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:09,417
- Is all the reason you're here?
- You still a wanted man.

499
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,085
Yeah.

500
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:19,219
- What about the money?
- The money stays here!

501
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:55,296
10 years ago, I would have shot you.

502
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:59,759
But I learned that every man
needs a second chance.

503
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:06,099
- That could be your failing, Pike.
- Could be.

504
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:38,756
- I'm not surprised that you didn't shoot him.
- That would have been kind of difficult.

505
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,597
I pay $ 100 a man.

506
01:19:29,296 --> 01:19:32,018
$ 100 for a two day ride.

507
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:42,028
I'm very busy man.

508
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:49,660
How much money do they have these men?

509
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,871
Enough.

510
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:55,124
Enough...

511
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:57,482
for them...

512
01:19:58,086 --> 01:20:00,226
for you...

513
01:20:01,686 --> 01:20:02,934
and... us?

514
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:08,304
I need a little more.

515
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:13,309
These must very dangerous these men...

516
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:19,649
...if you need so many of us to catch them.

517
01:20:19,774 --> 01:20:22,271
A little challenge for you, isn't it?

518
01:20:22,933 --> 01:20:26,789
You'll get paid. If you do exactly
as I say.

519
01:20:27,084 --> 01:20:29,029
Exactly as you say?

520
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:33,454
- But you guarantee it?
- You got my word.

521
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,612
Pfff... your word!

522
01:20:37,846 --> 01:20:42,964
To us a word is a very valuable thing.

523
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:44,257
Good...

524
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:49,220
I accept your guarantee.

525
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:53,474
We will ride with you and your word.

526
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:55,268
But...

527
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:58,844
If you don't pay us,

528
01:20:59,447 --> 01:21:03,573
Then we'll ride after you.

529
01:22:07,214 --> 01:22:09,175
Did you hear that?

530
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:13,262
Now, he's is gonna give 100
dollars to these Mexicans!

531
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:17,350
We're not any closer to that money
than we started!

532
01:22:17,650 --> 01:22:23,522
Look who's here. No drink, no smoke,
no chew. No sleep?

533
01:22:31,276 --> 01:22:35,785
Someone in the camp!
Mr. Kiefer! Over here!

534
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:14,800
Looks like some kind of work camp.

535
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:18,220
Yeah.

536
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:35,863
I figure this is about as far as we go.

537
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:40,542
Kinda thought you’d remember that.

538
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:44,413
kept the first half of my promise.

539
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:48,375
- Helped you to get here.
- That's right.

540
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,587
And you are planning on
keeping the rest of it, huh?

541
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:58,848
You wouldn’t respect a man who
didn't keep his word now, would you Pike?

542
01:24:58,973 --> 01:25:04,099
After all..you're the man who
gave his word to Morgan?

543
01:25:07,378 --> 01:25:11,190
- ain't you had enough fighting?
- ain't the point.

544
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:15,211
Do it on foot?

545
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:17,655
That's right.

546
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:20,157
We do it on foot.

547
01:25:31,085 --> 01:25:34,820
That's real sneaky, Pike.
Real sneaky.

548
01:25:34,945 --> 01:25:37,633
I never figured you for a low down
trick like that.

549
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:39,898
But I figured you’d.

550
01:26:29,143 --> 01:26:32,938
Fighting you don't please me, Pike.

551
01:26:34,648 --> 01:26:36,775
It's the money I want.

552
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,652
Senor!

553
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,739
Senor! Senor!

554
01:28:57,099 --> 01:29:00,502
Senor! They are coming! They are coming!

555
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:05,549
- Chico, what's wrong?
- Many of them. An army.

556
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:09,594
- Where are they?
- Over there. On the hill.

557
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:47,340
Chico, I want you to ride ahead..

558
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:50,427
Go to Sonora and ask where
Morgan's ranch is. Do you understand?

559
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:53,722
Si, senor. Morgan ranch.
I understand.

560
01:29:54,187 --> 01:29:56,277
What about the men?

561
01:29:56,683 --> 01:30:00,645
I'll take care of men.
I'll catch up with you in a little while.

562
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:04,158
Now, keep on riding no matter what...

563
01:30:04,293 --> 01:30:07,527
...and give no one this money except
Mrs. Morgan.

564
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:09,154
Chico...

565
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:11,448
...you tell her that Pike sent you.

566
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:14,711
I tell her that I said to
give you home.

567
01:30:14,836 --> 01:30:15,808
Si, senor.

568
01:30:15,933 --> 01:30:17,287
Kashtok.

569
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:20,229
You'll go on with him, understand?

570
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:28,819
I want you to take care of him.

571
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:42,062
- You go too.
- I kind of figured doing that any way.

572
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:44,022
Ain't you kinda scared?

573
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,567
I'll take my chances.

574
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,110
Amigo!

575
01:30:53,331 --> 01:30:55,200
G'luck.

576
01:31:49,554 --> 01:31:53,800
Those are the men with the money?
Then why we've stopped?

577
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:56,720
- Not all that simple.
- No?

578
01:31:56,845 --> 01:32:02,142
To me that dosen't look very hard...
...easier than robbing a bank.

579
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:07,138
Lot of dead men thought the same thing.
Move in when I say.

580
01:32:42,809 --> 01:32:46,686
We ain’t gonna see none of that
money the way he's giving it away.

581
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:49,856
Yeah. First there were three of us.
Now there's more than I can count.

582
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:53,985
Remember what he said. Dead is dead.

583
01:32:56,738 --> 01:33:00,158
You ain’t got the guts.

584
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:40,615
Mr. Kiefer?

585
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:43,534
Mr. Kiefer, sir.

586
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:47,789
I heard some talking last night
at Calvera's camp.

587
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:52,961
Something you should... know about.

588
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:56,673
I don't know who was talking.
I could not see his face.

589
01:33:56,798 --> 01:34:01,052
I heard someone said he was
gonna shoot you.

590
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:03,888
Yeah, shoot you.

591
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:07,225
Shoot you in the back.

592
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:25,660
I remember now.

593
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:28,496
It was Dumper.

594
01:34:30,415 --> 01:34:32,500
It was his idea.

595
01:34:34,763 --> 01:34:36,383
I didn't have anything to do with it!

596
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:10,909
I figured you might start worrying.

597
01:35:13,624 --> 01:35:17,378
Oh Hell.. I ain’t figured
you’d give a damn.

598
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:21,716
Then I guess we both were wrong.

599
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:27,972
Amigo...

600
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:31,893
You shouldn't go shoot in the
wrong direction.

601
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:35,396
Those we want are there.

602
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:43,404
Now, senor Kiefer...

603
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:47,200
...I think my men will do it alone.

604
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:48,743
Vamoose!

605
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:51,245
It's too late.

606
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,122
No.

607
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:55,166
Only for you.

608
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:58,002
We don't wait anymore.

609
01:36:07,678 --> 01:36:10,118
- How many do you figure out there?
- Couldn't be more than 40

610
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:13,651
40 against two.
Pretty bad odds.

611
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:20,691
For them.

612
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:40,419
It's shame that you never had any
of my fine cigars from New Orleans.

613
01:36:40,544 --> 01:36:43,047
How come you never tried one before, Pike?

614
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:46,717
Making a round I was doing no smoking.

615
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:52,257
But I guess I will now.

616
01:37:53,288 --> 01:37:56,954
Haul up there, Tyree!
We've got three seconds!

617
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:49,043
Hey, how come you didn't tell me
you couldn't swim?

618
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:52,218
You can't do everything perfect, Pike.

619
01:40:52,343 --> 01:40:55,733
Besides I was just trying to
keep my gun dry.

620
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:01,513
Well...

621
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:06,560
Are you ready to take
this long hard... Walk?
