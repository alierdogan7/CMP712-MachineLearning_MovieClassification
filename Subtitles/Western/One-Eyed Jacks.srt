177

Say, I wonder what happened
to your friend, huh?

178
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:27,829
Well, uh, maybe he goes back
to find the shoes.

179
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,248

she'll get us horses and clothes.

183
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,031
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

184
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:48,952
Well. <i>Vamos para allá.</i>

185
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,640
I've been thinking, amigo,
about this Longworth.

186
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,852
Must be very hard to find him.

187
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,147
It's a very big country.

188
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:20,734
I know all his old stompin' grounds.

189
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,615
Sooner or later I'm gonna find him.

190
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:29,826
Five years we spent in that stinking hole.

191
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,369
'Bout time we live a little.

192
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,165
- What if he's dead?
- Then I'll find him dead.

193
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,753
You could spend the rest of your life
looking for this man.

194
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,882
Let's get going.

195
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:45,509

Oh.

00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:55,115
It's five or six years since I see you.

Hey, what happened to your friend?

247
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:12,048
Well, I don't know.
I kinda lost track of him.

- When was the last time you seen him?
- Not since he was here with you.

249

You remember. When the rurales
came and killed that guy —

250

<i>¡Ay, Chihuahua!</i>

251
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:25,687
Maybe he run back over the border.

<i>- Momentito. Momentito.</i>
- Come on.

263
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:54,674
Don't be doin' her like that.

264
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:02,223
- What'd you just say?
- I said, don't be doin' her like that.

265
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:05,810
You know, I've had just about
enough out of you, jackass.

266
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,454
Well, Harvey Johnson's gonna be
a famous name round these parts.

267
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:29,959
You're gonna get yourself killed
by a fella called Rio.

268
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,303

269
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,890
That ain't him.

270
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,475
It ain't, huh?

271
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,063
I wouldn't want to lose me
a handful of brains tryin' to find out.

272
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,731
Now, would you, Harv?

273
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,904
I don't care if it is him.

274
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,739
(chuckles)

275
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,533
You don't, huh?

276
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,004
My name's Amory. I'd like to
sit down with you and buy you a drink.

277
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,257
Got something I'd like to talk over.

278
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,052
<i>Te veo, guapo.</i>

279
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,348
Mind if I sit down?

280
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:37,402
Oh, don't pay no attention to him.
He's just pumped up a little.

281
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:41,865
You must have heard of me.
Bob Amory?

282
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:44,826
Nope.

283
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:52,500
Well, don't matter anyway.

284
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:55,879
You know what's a real piece of luck?
My running into you like this.

285
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,841
Got a good idea
I'd like to talk to you about.

286
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:06,514
How would you like to get rich
once and for all?

287
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:12,437
You could stand a piece of change,
couldn't you?

288
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,067
You got something to tell me?

289
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:23,448
Fourteen days' ride from here,
there's a town.

290
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:29,162
And in that town
there's the fattest bank you ever saw.

291
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,706
And it ain't nothin' but a cheese box.

292
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,210
What are you telling me all this for?

293
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:39,881
I'm gonna need some help to take that bank.

294
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:42,550
How come you don't do it on your own?

295
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:46,763
Two men ain't enough.

296
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:55,605
I never saw a bank two men couldn't take.

297
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,108
That's true.

298
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:01,361
But this is a little different deal.

299
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:06,407
Word's going around that you're
looking hard for Dad Longworth,

300
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,493
that there's dirt between you.

301
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,871
Now, if that's true,

302
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,457
I can tell you where you can find him.

303
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,003
Want me to keep talkin'?

304
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,467
Mm-hmm.

305
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,930
Now, here's where the fun comes.

306
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,143
And it's gonna tickle you.

307
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,732
The sheriff in that town is Dad Longworth.

309
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,616

310
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,831
Yeah.

311
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:19,105
BOB: Well, there she is.

312
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,566
Monterey, California.

313
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:26,779

just makes me wanna cry.

You go in there and get the rooms.
I'll be back.

322
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,668
Looking for somebody?

323
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:08,381
Looking for Dad Longworth.
Could you tell me where I could find him?

324
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,675
What do you want with him?

325
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:12,343
I wanna see him.

Darling, give me my holster, please.

Well, how you been?

All right.

Nothin'. I was just driftin' through.

I thought I'd look in on you.

How 'bout a drink?

Well.

370
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:41,028
Remember the last time
we had tequila together?

371
00:38:41,112 --> 00:38:45,533
Sure do. That was up on the mountain
when we was hung up there. Remember?

372
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:47,702
- About five years ago.
- That's right.

373
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:50,579
No, just — Yeah, that's right.
It was just under five years.

374
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:56,168
I, uh — I guess you wondered
why I never showed with the horses.

375
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:58,045
Yeah, I thought about it.

376
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,758
Well, you know, knowin'
how you was in them days,

377
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:06,262
I figured you for gettin' drunk
and fallin' down onto some <i>chiquita</i>

378
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:08,848
and losing track of time. (chuckles)

379
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:13,686
No, I didn't forget, kid.

380
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:16,230
But there was nothing I could do.

381
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:19,358
When I got to that little <i>rancho,</i>
there were no horses.

382
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:21,360
That old Mexican couldn't talk American,

383
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:23,362
and when I finally figured out his lingo

384
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:26,741
he was saying that he had sold
the horses a couple of weeks before.

385
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:31,412
The old paint horse I was riding
was pretty done in,

386
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:33,247
but I headed straight for you.

387
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:37,918
When I got to the canyon,
I see rurales all over the place.

388
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:43,007
Well, I — I high-tailed it out of there

389
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:47,386
and got as far as La Quinta
before the horse caved in.

390
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,472
I hid out in a cantina

391
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:53,642
and I gave the bartender some gold
to keep his mouth shut.

392
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:56,729
Well, there wasn't too much of that,
as I recollect it.

393
00:39:56,812 --> 00:40:00,733
There was enough to get me over the border
and all the way here.

394
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,401
Here to Monterey.

395
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:05,988
I figured I'd keep my nose clean
until the —

396
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:12,161
till that, um, fracas down in Mexico
was forgotten.

397
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:15,664
Well, I kept myself clean.

398
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:19,043
Clean enough to be elected sheriff.

399
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:22,963
Knowing me the way I used to be, I...

400
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:25,591
I couldn't blame you for not believing.

401
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:32,098
But if you're looking now
to be satisfied for what I did,

402
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:35,851
I'd be sorry for it, kid.

403
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:40,648
But if that's what you want, just let me know
how and where you want the play.

404
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:43,984
I'll stand up to you.

405
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:48,030
You're gettin' way ahead of yourself, Dad.

406
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:52,576
No need for all that,
'cause nothin' happened to me.

407
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,705
I just fooled around with them dogfaces
till it got dark.

408
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:59,125
Then I went down
and stole the captain's horse.

409
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:02,336
They wasn't about to find me neither.

410
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:06,465
Then after that it was just, you know,

411
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:08,592
rosemary and sweet whiskey and...

412
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:12,346
just whoopin' and yellin'.

413
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,016
You sure that's the straight of it, kid?

414
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:20,146
Well, you know me, Dad.

415
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,148
If I didn't feel right about it,

416
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:24,024
we'd have been out there

417
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:26,819
splatterin' each other
all over that front yard.

418
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:33,242
I admit I was hot about it for a time,
but that's five years ago.

419
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:37,580
A man can't stay angry for five years.

420
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:41,041
Can he?

421
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,639
You know what you're gonna do?

422
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:57,474
No.

423
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:59,810
You're gonna stay to supper.

424
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,355
Well, listen, Dad, I — (clears throat)

425
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:07,234
I tell ya, I was just pokin' through
and thought I'd stop in and say hello.

426
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:11,030
- But it wouldn't look good, me hanging around.
- You let me worry about that.

427
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:13,699
Well, now, you'd better think about it,

428
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:17,328
'cause... I'm still in business.

429
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:21,123
I want you to meet my family anyhow.

430
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,419
- All right.
- Good.

431
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:28,339
Come on.

432
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,178
Maria!

433
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,348
Just a minute, kid.

434
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:40,726
Maria! I want you to meet
an old friend of mine.

435
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:43,437

- DAD: Maria?

436
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,105
(door closes)

437
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:01,830
Hello.

438
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:04,333
Hello.

439
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:06,835
Are you waiting for my father?

440
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:09,463
Yeah.

441
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:12,925
Would you like to sit down?

442
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:15,552
Yes, I — I would, thank you.

443
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:18,305
- Who is he?
- I want you to meet him.

444
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:20,140
Ah. I'm glad you're here.

445
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:24,103
Rio, I want you to meet my entire family.

446
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:25,688
My wife Maria.

447
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:27,815
- How are you?
- Ma'am, it's a pleasure.

448
00:43:27,898 --> 00:43:30,609
- And have you met my stepdaughter?
- Just that little.

449
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:33,779
- Well, this is Louisa, my stepdaughter.
- How do you do?

450
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:36,865
I love her as though
she were my own natural child.

451
00:43:38,534 --> 00:43:40,452
Uh, Rio's staying to supper.

452
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:42,454
Wonderful. We're happy to have you.

453
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:45,457
- Well, I don't want you to do any fussin'.
- Oh, no, there's nothing —

454
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:48,544
No, no, no, no fuss at all.
You wanna wash up?

455
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:51,880
Yeah.

456
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:54,091
Take his hat.

457
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:00,055

DAD: Heavenly father,

459
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:06,729
in thy graciousness thou has seen fit
to grace this table with thy divine bounty.

460
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:10,399
We offer up our humble thanks

461
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:13,319
and ask that you bless this food
to our use

462
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:15,863
and us to thy service.

463
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:20,993
And make us ever mindful of the needs
of others. In Jesus' name. Amen.

464
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:24,621
I never knew you to pray
over the grub before, Dad. Yeah.

465
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:26,665
Have you known each other for a long time?

466
00:44:26,749 --> 00:44:29,376
Oh, yeah. Dad and I go way back.

467
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:33,839
I wasn't anything more than a kid
when Dad picked me up.

468
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:36,800
I have never heard him
talking about you before.

469
00:44:36,884 --> 00:44:39,595
Well, we was kinda hairy in them days.

470
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,639
When he was a bandit, no?

471
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:47,978
That's all right, kid. Everybody here knows
I used to be on the other side of the law.

472
00:44:49,563 --> 00:44:53,192
Yeah, we were a couple of cockleburs, huh?
Had a lot of fun, didn't we?

473
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:55,861
- Always full of laughs, Dad.
- (chuckles)

474
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:01,658
You know, it's a wonder
we didn't get our fool heads shot off.

475
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:04,328
That or wind up in the pen or something.

476
00:45:05,204 --> 00:45:06,330
Lucky.

477
00:45:07,331 --> 00:45:09,208
- Just luck, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

478
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:13,128
Of course, that was a...
that was a long time ago.

479
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:15,798
You were a bank robber, Mr. Rio?

480
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,384
Yes, ma'am.

481
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:20,469
Me and your dad here.

482
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:22,388
But no more.

483
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:23,931
No more.

484
00:45:25,808 --> 00:45:28,102
Will you be in Monterey long?

485
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:33,148
Well, long enough to get my horse shod
and do a couple things.

486
00:45:33,232 --> 00:45:35,317
And after that, where are you going?

487
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:40,030
I don't know, Mrs. Longworth.
I thought I might go up to Oregon.

488
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:44,576
That's awful pretty country up there.
Thought I'd go take a look.

489
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,620
Will you be here for our fiesta?

490
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:50,541
- When is that gonna be?
- Well, tomorrow and tomorrow night.

491
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:53,752
But you will not be able to buy
any shoe for your horse

492
00:45:53,836 --> 00:45:56,046
because everything will be closed.

493
00:45:57,798 --> 00:46:01,260
You mean, the barbershop
and the blacksmith, bank and all?

494
00:46:01,343 --> 00:46:03,053
Bank, everything'll be closed.

495
00:46:03,846 --> 00:46:06,932
Yes, so why don't you stay here?

496
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:09,768
You heard <i>señor.</i> He's going to Oregon.

497
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:14,773
Well, you know, I just could
lay over a day or two.

498
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:19,278
Don't expect too much, kid.
It's just a street dance, that's all.

499
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:22,614
Well, must be enough there
to give a man a laugh.

500
00:46:22,698 --> 00:46:24,700
Then you will stay?

501
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:27,578
Well, from such a lovely young lady

502
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:30,831
I don't know as how I could
rightly refuse an invitation.

503
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,918
(Rio laughing)

504
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:36,628
RIO: Yeah, I'll stay.

505
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:41,717
- (both laughing)
- RIO: Don't tell me they're for real.

506
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,138
RIO: Yeah.

507
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:48,974
Well, I don't know about you, kid,

508
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:51,602
but it's been a great day for me.

509
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:57,816
For five years it's been tearing at me,
and I'm sure glad it's all under the bridge.

510
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:00,736
I'll bet.

511
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:05,991
Good party, Dad.
You tell the missus thanks again for me.

512
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,618
Yes, I will.

513
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,581
Good night, Rio. Thanks for coming.

514
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:14,666
My pleasure, Dad.

00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:08,087
I work for the government.

685
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:10,506
Why did you lie about it?

686
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:13,509
Well, I had to.

687
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:16,846
I was sworn in under oath
not to talk about my job.

688
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,017
Anyhow, I'm going to Oregon tomorrow,
but not just to look around.

689
00:59:21,935 --> 00:59:25,063
I'll be gone as long as four or five months.

690
00:59:26,189 --> 00:59:30,360
You're to come back to Monterey...
sometime?

691
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:33,446
Yeah, I'm hoping to.

692
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:38,701
Miss Louisa, I don't have
much time to court you.

693
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:42,538
And I...

694
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:45,750
I ain't exactly what you'd call
a high-bred gentleman.

695
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:50,630
But before I go I want you to know that
I think you'd make a man a wonderful wife.

696
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:55,551
And I know I ain't got no right
to say this, but...

697
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,849
I want you to wait for me.

698
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:05,144
I don't know what to say.

699
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:08,648
You don't have to say nothin' now.

700
01:00:09,691 --> 01:00:11,943
I was just hoping you'd think about it.

701
01:00:17,115 --> 01:00:20,159
Yes, I will wait for you.

702
01:00:21,369 --> 01:00:24,497
You don't have no idea
how good that makes me feel.

703
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:30,878
I don't have much of anything to give ya.

704
01:00:30,962 --> 01:00:33,256
I don't have no ring or nothin'.

705
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:37,260
All I got is...

706
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:39,554
this necklace here.

707
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:42,974
My mother give this to me
just before she died.

708
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:49,689
And it'd mean an awful lot to me
if you'd wear it while I'm gone.

709
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:05,538
I will very proud to wear it.

710
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:08,351
I will miss you very much.

711
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:10,978
But I will write you every day.

712
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:16,150
Where can I write to you in Oregon?

713
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:25,410
I ain't going to Oregon.

714
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:28,788
But you must go.

715
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:31,165
I don't want to keep you from your work.

716
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:36,963
I don't have no work.

717
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:40,591
I make my living robbing banks.

718
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:44,137
What do you mean?

719
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:48,683
I mean that...

720
01:02:50,017 --> 01:02:53,312
everything I told you about
last night was lies.

721
01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:58,192
You lie?

722
01:03:03,531 --> 01:03:05,032
Yeah.

723
01:03:08,703 --> 01:03:10,371
About everything?

724
01:03:12,623 --> 01:03:14,208
Yeah, just about.

725
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:34,562
But your mother's necklace...

726
01:03:36,898 --> 01:03:38,065
True?

727
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:42,236
I never knew nothin' about my mother.

728
01:03:43,446 --> 01:03:47,283
I bought that thing off a girl
for 25 bucks.

729
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:53,289
Well... (exhales)

730
01:03:55,124 --> 01:03:56,626
That's about it.

731
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:01,672
It ain't gonna help much to say it, but...

732
01:04:02,673 --> 01:04:04,258
I shamed you.

733
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,263
I wish to God I hadn't.

734
01:04:14,644 --> 01:04:16,979
You only shame yourself.

735
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:27,360
- (gasps)
- Scare ya?

736
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:29,362
Out kinda late, huh?

737
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:31,739
What are you doing here?

738
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:34,158
I reckon I know where you been.

739
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:35,743
I was just walking.

740
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:39,997
Let's take a little walk, you and me.

741
01:06:40,081 --> 01:06:42,083
One more ain't gonna make no difference.

742
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:50,174
Get out of my way.

743
01:07:28,129 --> 01:07:29,714
(whispering) Dad.

744
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:31,090
(louder) Dad!

745
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:34,927
It's me, Lon.

746
01:07:52,528 --> 01:07:56,157
Sure am sorry to get you up
this early, Dad.

747
01:08:01,162 --> 01:08:03,164
I hate to tell you this.

748
01:08:04,123 --> 01:08:06,083
She's been out all night.

749
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:08,169
Who?

750
01:08:09,253 --> 01:08:10,713
Louisa.

751
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:12,506
With that Rio fella.

752
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:26,020
How do you know, Lon?

753
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:30,649
I've been round here half the night,
and she just this minute come home.

754
01:08:30,733 --> 01:08:32,818
Looking kinda messy too.

755
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,408
Sure hate to be the one to...
the one to tell you, Dad.

756
01:09:15,611 --> 01:09:17,738
Lon tells me that, uh...

757
01:09:18,989 --> 01:09:20,741
you were out with Rio all night.

758
01:09:20,825 --> 01:09:22,409
Is that true?

759
01:09:25,663 --> 01:09:26,789
No.

760
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:30,292
Then why are you still dressed?
Why hasn't your bed been slept in?

761
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:33,546
Hmm?

762
01:09:33,629 --> 01:09:35,130
(shouts) Answer me!

763
01:09:35,923 --> 01:09:37,424
Were you with him?

764
01:09:38,342 --> 01:09:40,678
Yes, but... but...

765
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:42,471
But what? What? What?

766
01:09:42,555 --> 01:09:45,182
- Nothing happened.
- Don't you lie to me!

767
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:48,477
I'm not lying to you!
We just walked on the beach!

768
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:50,521
- That's all? You just walked on the beach?
- Yes!

769
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:53,274
- We just walked on the beach! I swear that!
- What's the matter?

770
01:09:53,357 --> 01:09:56,193
What's happened here? What is it?

771
01:09:58,195 --> 01:09:59,780
Louisa, what happened?

772
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:06,120
Mother, I want to speak to you
for a moment.

773
01:10:09,999 --> 01:10:11,792
Louisa, what happened?

774
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:16,630
<i>¿Qué hiciste en toda la noche?</i>

775
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:19,133
<i>¿Te pasó algo?</i>

776
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,552
<i>¡Contesta!</i>

777
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:23,679
Mother, I'm waiting!

778
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:41,113
I think she's lying to me,
and I want you to find out.

779
01:10:41,196 --> 01:10:42,531
Louisa would never lie.

780
01:10:43,324 --> 01:10:45,367
I hope you're right.

781
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:59,256
Louisa.

782
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,883
<i>¿Es verdad?</i>

783
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:03,886
<i>¿Te fuiste con él?</i>

784
01:11:09,808 --> 01:11:11,435
<i>¿Por qué, Louisa?</i>

785
01:11:13,187 --> 01:11:14,730
<i>¿Por qué lo hiciste?</i>

786
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,567
<i>Porque yo creí que él me quería.</i>

787
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,695
<i>Y era mentira.</i>

788
01:11:42,174 --> 01:11:44,259
<i>Perdóname, mamá.</i>

789
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:47,763
<i>Perdóname.</i>

790
01:11:49,515 --> 01:11:51,016
<i>Hija.</i>

791
01:11:53,102 --> 01:11:54,728
(door closes)

792
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:03,821
Was she telling the truth?

793
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:08,158
Yes.

794
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:11,662
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

795
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:14,289
But she was out with him all night.

796
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:16,333
She's all right.

797
01:12:18,669 --> 01:12:21,046
You keep her in her room.

798
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:26,260
(door opens, closes)

799
01:12:34,226 --> 01:12:36,854
- HOWARD: My little girl.
- (glass shatters)

800
01:12:36,937 --> 01:12:40,024
(laughing)

801
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,778
(laughing continues)

802
01:12:44,862 --> 01:12:48,240
There you are, gents.
Here's some hot coffee for you.

803
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:51,201
I guess you can use it
after last night, huh?

804
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:54,580
- Oh, what a night.
- (Howard chattering, laughing)

805
01:12:54,663 --> 01:12:56,665
Hey, hombre.

806
01:12:56,749 --> 01:12:59,126
This horse is still fighting for his life.

807
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:01,628
That's what you got
a sharp knife for, friend.

808
01:13:01,712 --> 01:13:03,589
Barney! It's a party.

809
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:06,383
I told you I'll be with you in a minute, Howard.

810
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:07,760
<i>Ay, me duele.</i>

811
01:13:09,595 --> 01:13:13,515
(grunts)
Oh, what a night we had. What a night.

812
01:13:14,725 --> 01:13:17,102
Now what do you want?

813
01:13:17,186 --> 01:13:21,190
We're bone dry. (laughing continues)
So bone dry.

814
01:13:21,273 --> 01:13:24,151
- Give us some more whiskey.
- What do you want to eat?

815
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:26,570
- You got any chili?
- WOMAN: I'm not hungry.

816
01:13:26,653 --> 01:13:29,114
- Take a nice drink for yourself.
- Use this one.

817
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:31,366
- Come on, drink up.
- I don't want any. Please.

818
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:34,203
- Drink up. Be a nice girl.
- The night's over with.

819
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:36,580
Grab the glass. That's it.
Now, come on, drink.

820
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:38,665
- Let's see you drink.
- No, I don't want any.

821
01:13:38,749 --> 01:13:41,794
Why not? Drink, you cow. Come on, drink!

822
01:13:41,877 --> 01:13:43,629
- (gasps)
- Drink it!

823
01:13:43,712 --> 01:13:46,965
That's it. That's the way
you gotta treat them, Barney.

824
01:13:47,049 --> 01:13:49,426
- All right.
- You pay them, they don't wanna eat.

825
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:51,762
- You owe me six bits.
- Wait a minute, Barney.

826
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:55,224
She's gotta have something to eat.
I don't want my little girl to starve.

827
01:13:55,307 --> 01:13:57,684
- Please, I'm sick.
- You gonna eat?

828
01:13:57,768 --> 01:14:00,187
- Go on about your business.
- Come on. Take it easy!

829
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:03,482
Get it out of here! This is a nice place.
What do you think you're doing?

830
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:07,069
You're gonna give me a dollar
so I can pay this man. He's mad at us.

831
01:14:07,152 --> 01:14:11,073
- Please, he's breaking my arm.
- (laughing)

832
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:14,910
- You gonna be good now?
- Will that be all?

833
01:14:14,993 --> 01:14:17,955
- Yeah, just about.
- Thank you very much.

834
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,710
- How are you, sonny boy?
- Good morning.

835
01:14:23,794 --> 01:14:25,754
(grunting)

836
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:28,924
(screams)

837
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,804
You get up, you big tub of guts.

838
01:14:42,271 --> 01:14:44,398
<i>- Con esto lo mato.
- ¡Tú, ya!</i>

839
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:46,483
<i>- ¡Tú quítate de enfrente o te mato!
- ¡Basta ya!</i>

840
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:47,901
<i>¡Suéltame!</i>

841
01:14:47,985 --> 01:14:50,028
<i>¡Quítate tú o te mato a ti también!</i>

842
01:14:50,112 --> 01:14:54,158
<i>¡Los mato! ¡Los mato esta vez! ¡Suelta!</i>

843
01:14:54,241 --> 01:14:56,160
<i>¡Cuidado!</i>

844
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:14,136
If I told him once, I told him a thousand times
something like this was gonna happen.

845
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:18,223
Well, it finally got him.

846
01:15:19,725 --> 01:15:21,727
Mister, you really killed him.

847
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:25,981
I better take care of this.

848
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:29,067
(spits) <i>Bicho abusivo.</i>

849
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,195
<i>Te mataron por fin.</i>

850
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:37,451
<i>¡Suéltame tú también! ¡Suéltame, te digo!</i>

851
01:15:40,162 --> 01:15:42,748
Now what do we do, amigo?

852
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,252
This don't change nothin'.

853
01:15:49,755 --> 01:15:52,591
We just wait for them two

854
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:54,509
and get on with it.

855
01:15:59,556 --> 01:16:01,558
Let's get us a drink.

856
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:15,155
- Hello, kid.
- Good morning, Dad.

857
01:16:20,494 --> 01:16:22,120
How'd it happen?

858
01:16:22,204 --> 01:16:24,790
We took to scuffling,

859
01:16:24,873 --> 01:16:28,502
and he come out from behind there
with that scattergun.

860
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:32,089
- Sounds like him.
- Yeah, he didn't give me no selection.

861
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:38,720
He was always askin' for it.

862
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:43,892
If it hadn't been you, it would have
been somebody else, I guess.

863
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:55,946
Well, better get him out of here.

864
01:16:59,574 --> 01:17:01,910
I'll bring the coroner over.

865
01:17:01,994 --> 01:17:04,997
- You fellas give me a hand.
- Yeah, you bet.

866
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:18,552
Let's put him in the rig.

867
01:17:39,156 --> 01:17:41,325
Kid.

868
01:17:41,408 --> 01:17:44,828
Think it'd be a good idea
if you'd hand over your gun.

869
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:54,004
All right.

870
01:18:08,852 --> 01:18:10,729
Ephraim.

871
01:18:10,812 --> 01:18:12,397
- (gun cocks)
- Yeah.

872
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:16,234
Ace.

873
01:18:19,905 --> 01:18:21,490
Tim.

874
01:18:22,324 --> 01:18:23,950
Lon.

875
01:18:36,296 --> 01:18:37,881
Left hand, kid.

876
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,342
Dump it.

877
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:44,971
(gun clatters on ground)

878
01:18:45,472 --> 01:18:47,557
Lon.

879
01:18:49,351 --> 01:18:50,852
Come on.

880
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:12,582
I warned him not to cause
any trouble around here.

881
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:17,003
But no, kid, you ignored my warning
and went right ahead and killed a man.

882
01:19:17,087 --> 01:19:18,588
Didn't you?

883
01:19:19,673 --> 01:19:21,341
Well,

884
01:19:21,425 --> 01:19:23,427
we don't want his kind around here.

885
01:19:25,846 --> 01:19:28,765
I'm going to teach you a lesson
you'll never forget.

886
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:34,604
(shirt rips)

887
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:40,777
Now, let's see the kind of stuff
you're made of.

888
01:19:40,861 --> 01:19:42,362
(spits)

889
01:19:44,489 --> 01:19:46,450
(clears throat)

890
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:48,952
That's a pretty good start.

891
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:21,693
Look here what's happening to Romeo.

892
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:22,777
(whip cracks)

893
01:20:22,861 --> 01:20:25,530
- Oughta get down there and do something.
- Do something?

894
01:20:25,614 --> 01:20:27,657
- Not this horse.
- (whip cracks)

895
01:20:27,741 --> 01:20:30,702
Enough shotgun down there to start a war.

896
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:35,415
'Sides, it might help him
to get rid of some of that snot nose.

897
01:20:35,499 --> 01:20:38,752
- (whip cracks)
- What's this gonna do about the bank?

898
01:20:38,835 --> 01:20:43,173
Well, we'll just have to kiss that good-bye
for today anyway.

899
01:20:59,606 --> 01:21:01,525
Now what do you say, kid?

900
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:04,736
You better kill me.

901
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,821
- Kill you?
- Yeah.

902
01:21:06,905 --> 01:21:10,200
Nah. No, there's no need for that.

903
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:20,085
- (woman screams)
- (people gasping)

904
01:21:22,671 --> 01:21:24,839
Your gun days are over.

905
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:26,424
Untie him!

906
01:21:26,508 --> 01:21:28,593
Ephraim! Bring the horses here.

907
01:21:43,191 --> 01:21:45,277
Now, I'm letting you go.

908
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:50,282
But if you ever come back here again,
I'll shoot you down like a dog in the street.

909
01:22:03,587 --> 01:22:06,256
All right. That's all. It's all over now.

910
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,842
Go on. Back home!

911
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:34,743
Whew. Man.

912
01:22:34,826 --> 01:22:37,537
Slashed you clear down to the rib bone.

913
01:22:37,621 --> 01:22:39,706
Yeah, we're sure sorry about that, Rio.

914
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:44,252
We got in on the tail end of everything,
and there wasn't nothin' we could do.

915
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:46,087
It's all right, Bob.

916
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:48,798
The place was crawling all over
with deputies.

917
01:22:51,092 --> 01:22:53,345
You know me, Rio.

918
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:58,183
If there was anything I could have done,
I'd been in there like a streak.

919
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:03,563
- I said it's all right, Bob.
- Well, what's it gonna be now?

920
01:23:03,647 --> 01:23:07,150
There's a small fishing village
up the coast a couple of miles.

921
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:09,319
It's called Punta del Diablo.

922
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:11,738
When we get there, what then?

923
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,657
We'll just wait.

924
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:16,910
Just wait.

925
01:23:18,411 --> 01:23:20,413
Think you can make it that far, Rio?

926
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:26,878
Say, they really did mash that hand.

927
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:29,673
Whew.

928
01:23:30,965 --> 01:23:33,093
Looks like it might be all broke up.

929
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:40,684
I guess you won't be doin' no business
with that for quite a spell.

930
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:44,062
Well, there's no need
for you to hang around, Bob.

931
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:45,980
It ain't that, Rio.

932
01:23:46,064 --> 01:23:48,692
It's just that I'm thinking of you,
that's all.

933
01:23:51,361 --> 01:23:53,363
Come on. Let's go.

934
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:19,889
(chattering, laughing)

935
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:25,353
No! (speaking Cantonese)

936
01:24:25,437 --> 01:24:27,522
(horse whinnying)

937
01:24:37,407 --> 01:24:41,286
- What?
- We need some rooms.

938
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:44,164
My friend is sick.

939
01:24:44,998 --> 01:24:46,833
We need a place to stay.

940
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:49,794
- How many rooms?
- Four.

941
01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:56,176
Phew. What is that? Fish?

942
01:24:57,177 --> 01:24:59,179
Somethin' dead.

943
01:25:06,019 --> 01:25:08,521
Hey, where can we get a drink around here?

944
01:25:08,605 --> 01:25:10,440
There.

945
01:25:20,241 --> 01:25:22,160
(water pouring)

946
01:25:44,265 --> 01:25:45,892
Howdy, Miss Louisa.

947
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:47,644
Wait a minute.

948
01:25:47,727 --> 01:25:50,939
Boy, you're just as pretty
as a bird on a limb this morning.

949
01:25:51,773 --> 01:25:54,275
Say, I heard from a friend of yours.

950
01:25:54,359 --> 01:25:57,862
That fella, what's his name? Uh, Rio.

951
01:25:58,655 --> 01:26:00,740
Thought you'd be interested.

952
01:26:00,824 --> 01:26:03,409
Really? What about him?

953
01:26:03,493 --> 01:26:06,454
Nothin'.
He's a-hangin' out down at the point,

954
01:26:06,538 --> 01:26:09,374
lickin' his back.

955
01:26:09,457 --> 01:26:11,543
How would you know?

956
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:14,546
Somebody smelled him, I guess.

957
01:26:46,286 --> 01:26:47,787
Four weeks.

958
01:26:50,123 --> 01:26:52,834
I think the hand is finished, <i>chico.</i>

959
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:55,545
It's not going to get any better.

960
01:26:57,922 --> 01:26:59,924
Let it go.

961
01:27:01,134 --> 01:27:05,513
Let's go back to Morelos
and lay in the sun. (spits)

962
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:08,975
Forget this Longworth.

963
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:10,852
He's not worth it.

964
01:27:10,935 --> 01:27:12,854
Huh? What do you say, amigo?

965
01:27:17,942 --> 01:27:19,944
You must be crazy.

966
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:19,063
Hey.

967
01:29:19,147 --> 01:29:21,065
(gunshot)

968
01:29:21,149 --> 01:29:23,192
(speaking Cantonese)

969
01:29:23,276 --> 01:29:25,778
Take them stinkin' fish out of here.

970
01:29:25,862 --> 01:29:27,697
(gunshot)

971
01:29:32,702 --> 01:29:34,537
I'm through with the fish, Harv.

972
01:29:35,163 --> 01:29:39,417
That, and them damn waves
floppin' in all day long.

973
01:29:41,961 --> 01:29:43,671
(gunshot)

974
01:29:43,755 --> 01:29:47,383
Six weeks in this puke hole,
and listen to him.

975
01:29:50,136 --> 01:29:52,138
That hand ain't gettin' no better.

976
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:53,723
(gunshot)

977
01:29:59,187 --> 01:30:01,022
How's the hand, Rio?

978
01:30:02,607 --> 01:30:04,442
Oh, it's coming.

979
01:30:05,485 --> 01:30:09,363
You know, Rio, I've been wondering
if we oughta lay around here anymore.

980
01:30:09,447 --> 01:30:11,282
Throw me the dipper, Bob.

981
01:30:11,365 --> 01:30:15,328
I've been thinking a lot about
all that kale waitin' in the bank.

982
01:30:15,411 --> 01:30:17,622
How 'bout the dipper, Bob?

983
01:30:19,332 --> 01:30:21,334
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

984
01:30:22,376 --> 01:30:26,672
We're all gonna lay for that sheriff
outside his house some sunup.

985
01:30:26,756 --> 01:30:30,635
Cut him down with scatterguns
and then take that bank.

986
01:30:30,718 --> 01:30:33,054
That's not my style, Bob.

987
01:30:35,556 --> 01:30:37,475
It ain't, huh?

988
01:30:46,067 --> 01:30:50,488
Well, maybe you better change it
'cause your style seems a touch slow to me.

989
01:30:52,782 --> 01:30:55,076
I'm getting tired of listening to that bull.

990
01:30:55,952 --> 01:31:00,331
We rode 900 miles because you were
supposed to be the big man with an iron.

991
01:31:01,332 --> 01:31:04,043
But the way things are going,

992
01:31:04,127 --> 01:31:06,420
I think even I can outpull you now.

993
01:31:07,421 --> 01:31:09,715
Probably could get six into me...

994
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:19,058
before I got that one into you.

995
01:31:21,144 --> 01:31:22,645
Huh, Bob?

996
01:31:26,732 --> 01:31:28,943
<i>¿Qué no piensas levantarte
en toda la mañana, hija?</i>

997
01:31:29,026 --> 01:31:31,737
<i>Son las 8:00 de la mañana.
Ándale, levántate.</i>

998
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:35,116
<i>Hay muchas cosas que hacer.
Mira, toda la casa está tirada y tú aquí.</i>

999
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:36,701
Louisa.

1000
01:31:38,828 --> 01:31:41,038
<i>Louisa, ¿por qué no me contestas?</i>

1001
01:31:54,051 --> 01:31:55,553
Louisa.

1002
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:05,563
Louisa.

1003
01:32:08,065 --> 01:32:09,692
<i>Mamá.</i>

1004
01:32:11,652 --> 01:32:13,738
<i>Voy a tener un hijo.</i>

1005
01:33:11,504 --> 01:33:14,298
<i>Padre nuestro que estás en los cielos,
santificado sea tu nombre.</i>

1006
01:33:14,382 --> 01:33:16,467
<i>Venga a nos tu reino.</i>

1007
01:33:18,594 --> 01:33:20,096
(gunshot)

1008
01:33:26,102 --> 01:33:27,436
(gunshot)

1009
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:32,984
(gunshot)

1010
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:52,086
(horse whinnies)

1011
01:34:16,527 --> 01:34:19,071
- Hello.
- Hello.

1012
01:34:19,155 --> 01:34:20,865
How are you?

1013
01:34:20,948 --> 01:34:22,450
I'm fine.

1014
01:34:23,659 --> 01:34:25,911
Are you all right now?

1015
01:34:25,995 --> 01:34:27,830
Yeah, I'm all right.

1016
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,002
Want to sit down?

1017
01:34:46,599 --> 01:34:49,477
How'd you find me here?

1018
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,937
- Lon told me.
- Lon?

1019
01:34:52,021 --> 01:34:54,023
I don't know how he knows.

1020
01:34:57,568 --> 01:34:59,070
Well...

1021
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:03,741
Don't matter.

1022
01:35:03,824 --> 01:35:06,410
I'll be gettin' outta here pretty quick.

1023
01:35:08,788 --> 01:35:10,790
Where are you going?

1024
01:35:13,834 --> 01:35:17,254
I'll figure that out
when I've finished up with Longworth.

1025
01:35:18,047 --> 01:35:19,548
Finish what?

1026
01:35:21,592 --> 01:35:23,094
I'm gonna kill him.

1027
01:35:25,513 --> 01:35:28,140
You're gonna kill him?

1028
01:35:28,224 --> 01:35:29,725
That's right.

1029
01:35:32,061 --> 01:35:35,689
But why? Just because he whipped you?

1030
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:39,193
Yeah. That, and a couple of other things.

1031
01:35:40,778 --> 01:35:43,614
I know it was a terrible thing,
what he did.

1032
01:35:44,573 --> 01:35:47,618
And I was ashamed for him.

1033
01:35:47,701 --> 01:35:50,579
But those are not reasons
for to kill a man.

1034
01:35:52,498 --> 01:35:53,999
Reasons?

1035
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:57,837
I got reasons.

1036
01:35:59,922 --> 01:36:02,341
I got 1,708 of 'em.

1037
01:36:04,718 --> 01:36:07,596
That's how many days I spent
down in that lead mine

1038
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,598
in the pen in Sonora.

1039
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:16,480
That's how many nights I spent digging
the maggots out of the sores in my ankles,

1040
01:36:16,564 --> 01:36:18,774
with the rats running all over me.

1041
01:36:20,568 --> 01:36:23,654
I laid awake for five years at night,

1042
01:36:23,737 --> 01:36:26,282
listening to men screaming and praying

1043
01:36:26,365 --> 01:36:29,201
while they was getting beat to death.

1044
01:36:29,285 --> 01:36:31,495
I don't understand.

1045
01:36:31,579 --> 01:36:33,205
You don't, huh?

1046
01:36:36,417 --> 01:36:38,711
Well, it ain't hard to understand.

1047
01:36:41,839 --> 01:36:45,718
Five years ago in Mexico,
we was caught on the hill by rurales.

1048
01:36:47,178 --> 01:36:49,221
And he run off to get fresh mounts.

1049
01:36:50,347 --> 01:36:52,349
And he never come back.

1050
01:36:53,934 --> 01:36:58,105
He was the best friend I had,
and he left me there for rot.

1051
01:36:59,064 --> 01:37:01,066
And you know what for?

1052
01:37:02,485 --> 01:37:04,320
Two sacks of gold.

1053
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:13,120
Are you sure he did this?

1054
01:37:13,913 --> 01:37:15,998
Yeah.

1055
01:37:18,459 --> 01:37:20,461
Well, that's my sad tale.

1056
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:26,592
And when it's over,

1057
01:37:28,052 --> 01:37:30,679
I was hopin' you'd come away with me.

1058
01:37:32,556 --> 01:37:34,725
After you murder him?

1059
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:37,978
That ain't murder.

1060
01:37:38,062 --> 01:37:41,565
That's just standin' up,
same as any man would do.

1061
01:37:42,983 --> 01:37:46,946
And you think to kill him
will make you a man?

1062
01:37:47,821 --> 01:37:50,074
I don't know about that.

1063
01:37:50,157 --> 01:37:53,869
But I know that I thought about him
every day for five years.

1064
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:57,331
And that was the only thing
that kept me going.

1065
01:38:00,501 --> 01:38:02,878
Rio.

1066
01:38:02,962 --> 01:38:06,048
There are not many chances in life
to be happy.

1067
01:38:07,049 --> 01:38:09,843
And I think that we have a good one now.

1068
01:38:10,511 --> 01:38:13,556
Won't you try to forget this?

1069
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:15,140
Forget it?

1070
01:38:17,685 --> 01:38:20,104
Not as long as I breathe.

1071
01:38:48,549 --> 01:38:50,050
Rio.

1072
01:39:19,747 --> 01:39:21,707
Rio.

1073
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:24,126
Please.

1074
01:39:24,209 --> 01:39:27,296
Please try to forget this.

1075
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,966
Please just take me with you.

1076
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:34,345
We can be very happy. Can't you forget?

1077
01:39:34,428 --> 01:39:38,057
- Can you forget all —
- I can't. I can't.

1078
01:39:39,141 --> 01:39:42,978
Don't you understand? I can't.
I gotta die to forget that.

1079
01:39:44,146 --> 01:39:45,731
Then...

1080
01:39:46,815 --> 01:39:49,735
I'll be going away too,

1081
01:39:49,818 --> 01:39:53,322
because I don't want to be here
when they bury you.

1082
01:39:55,157 --> 01:39:56,992
I love you.

1083
01:39:58,452 --> 01:40:02,414
I know that, my sweet man.

1084
01:40:02,498 --> 01:40:03,999
I love you.

1085
01:40:11,757 --> 01:40:13,592
Wait a minute.

1086
01:40:15,427 --> 01:40:19,139
You must've had some reason
for comin' all the way down here.

1087
01:40:20,557 --> 01:40:22,309
Yes, I did.

1088
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:26,772
But it doesn't matter now.

1089
01:41:05,853 --> 01:41:08,147
Mr. Modesto,
I'm gonna raise you for a bit.

1090
01:41:08,230 --> 01:41:11,608
Boy, that's — that's too rich
for my blood, Bob.

1091
01:41:11,692 --> 01:41:14,737
- (Bob chuckling)
<i>- Ni yo. ¿Qué? Qué suerte.</i>

1092
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:17,865
Well, now, thanks for the donations, gents.

1093
01:41:17,948 --> 01:41:19,783
(chuckling)

1094
01:41:21,118 --> 01:41:24,955
How 'bout some of your cash there, Romeo?

1095
01:41:28,959 --> 01:41:32,212
Man oughta dig up something
for being around this manure pile.

1096
01:41:32,296 --> 01:41:34,006
Huh, Harv?

1097
01:41:34,089 --> 01:41:35,716
That's right, Bob.

1098
01:41:35,799 --> 01:41:39,219
Maybe the boy's all petered out
from playing on the beach

1099
01:41:39,303 --> 01:41:40,929
with that little jumpin' bean.

1100
01:41:41,013 --> 01:41:44,016
That's right, Bob.
He should have shared with us.

1101
01:41:45,517 --> 01:41:48,812
Get up, you scum-suckin' pig!

1102
01:41:50,105 --> 01:41:51,607
Get up!

1103
01:41:57,404 --> 01:42:00,282
I want you standin' when I open you up.

1104
01:42:01,283 --> 01:42:03,285
Now, get on up.

1105
01:42:09,374 --> 01:42:10,876
Go on.

1106
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,842
You got right on the edge.

1107
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:23,722
You mention her once more,

1108
01:42:23,806 --> 01:42:26,141
and I'm gonna tear your arms out.

1109
01:43:01,718 --> 01:43:04,847
Guess we forget
about the bank tomorrow, huh?

1110
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:08,392
Yeah.

1111
01:43:10,477 --> 01:43:12,312
What are you gonna do now?

1112
01:43:13,939 --> 01:43:17,109
I'll be going in after her in the morning.

1113
01:43:17,985 --> 01:43:19,611
What about Longworth?

1114
01:43:26,285 --> 01:43:29,830
I just pray to God I don't run into him.

1115
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:42,009
You ridin' with us, Modesto?

1116
01:43:42,968 --> 01:43:45,345
I don't know. You going back to Mexico?

1117
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:48,974
I just might.

1118
01:43:50,017 --> 01:43:52,019
What do you think about it, Harv?

1119
01:43:52,102 --> 01:43:53,979
Might as well.

1120
01:43:55,063 --> 01:43:56,690
Nothin' else to do.

1121
01:43:57,482 --> 01:44:01,486
How 'bout your friend? Is he still set
on going in after that female?

1122
01:44:01,570 --> 01:44:04,615
Yeah, I guess so. I don't know.

1123
01:44:04,698 --> 01:44:07,534
- I'm gonna say good-bye. Then we go, huh?
- All right.

1124
01:44:18,629 --> 01:44:20,130
<i>Chico.</i>

1125
01:44:22,049 --> 01:44:23,592
(horse blusters)

1126
01:44:23,675 --> 01:44:26,053
We'll be riding out now.

1127
01:44:26,136 --> 01:44:28,513
I just come to say <i>adios.</i>

1128
01:44:33,310 --> 01:44:36,313
We rode a long way together, buster.

1129
01:44:36,396 --> 01:44:37,898
That's right.

1130
01:44:40,275 --> 01:44:44,071
- You think of me once in a while, no?
- You bet.

1131
01:44:44,154 --> 01:44:46,573
You bet. I'm gonna miss you, <i>frijol.</i>

1132
01:44:48,408 --> 01:44:53,038
Hey, listen, you get tired of around here,
come to Morelos.

1133
01:44:53,121 --> 01:44:55,874
I got a little place down in Tepoztlán.

1134
01:44:55,958 --> 01:45:00,087
It's not much,
<i>pero</i> you can live quiet there, huh?

1135
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:03,048
I might do that, <i>chico.</i>
I just might do that.

1136
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,634
<i>Bueno. Adiós, amigo.</i>

1137
01:45:05,717 --> 01:45:07,511
<i>Adiós,</i> boy.

1138
01:45:07,594 --> 01:45:09,596
You take care now.

1139
01:45:24,444 --> 01:45:26,613
<i>¡Rio! ¡Adiós, amigo!</i>

1140
01:45:26,697 --> 01:45:29,449
<i>¡Que te vaya bien! ¡Cuídate!</i>

1141
01:45:29,533 --> 01:45:31,535
<i>- ¡Adiós!
- ¡Adiós!</i>

1142
01:45:40,627 --> 01:45:42,796
Hey, where you going?
That's the wrong way, no?

1143
01:45:42,879 --> 01:45:44,381
Uh-uh. This way.

1144
01:45:44,464 --> 01:45:47,175
- That's the way to Monterey.
- That's right.

1145
01:45:47,259 --> 01:45:50,095
We're going to take the bank right now.

1146
01:45:50,178 --> 01:45:53,807
- I mean, just the two of you?
- Kind of figured on maybe three.

1147
01:45:55,809 --> 01:45:57,102
You in, or you out?

1148
01:45:57,185 --> 01:45:59,354
Not me. That's no good.

1149
01:45:59,438 --> 01:46:02,607
We go in now, we make a lot
of trouble for Rio, you know?

1150
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:05,110
If we wait, maybe.

1151
01:46:05,193 --> 01:46:07,904
We're all through waiting for Rio.

1152
01:46:09,239 --> 01:46:14,911
No more waitin' and no more takin' that bull,
'cause he ain't the big man no more. I am.

1153
01:46:15,495 --> 01:46:17,956
Now, you comin' or not?

1154
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:20,709
Not me. And neither are you.

1155
01:46:21,877 --> 01:46:24,046
You gonna try to stop me, <i>cholo?</i>

1156
01:46:24,963 --> 01:46:26,757
Yeah, I'm gonna stop you.

1157
01:46:27,466 --> 01:46:31,261
Well, now, Modesto,
I'm — I'm real disappointed,

1158
01:46:31,344 --> 01:46:34,139
you pulled on an old sidekick like that.

1159
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:36,558
You're gonna give Rio time.

1160
01:46:36,641 --> 01:46:38,393
I tell you something.

1161
01:46:38,477 --> 01:46:41,229
One more word out of you,
and I cut you in half.

1162
01:46:41,313 --> 01:46:43,482
One more word, huh?

1163
01:46:47,486 --> 01:46:50,155
Let me see. Maybe I can think of one.

1164
01:46:51,448 --> 01:46:53,450
Yeah, I got one.

1165
01:46:53,533 --> 01:46:56,912
G-R-E-A-S-E-R. Greaser.

1166
01:46:56,995 --> 01:46:59,372
(gun clicking)

1167
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,875
Try it again. (laughing)

1168
01:47:07,005 --> 01:47:10,717
I'm real disappointed in greaseball.
Ain't you, Harv?

1169
01:47:10,801 --> 01:47:12,260
HARVEY: Sure am.

1170
01:47:12,344 --> 01:47:15,180
Maybe this is what you're looking for.

1171
01:47:20,519 --> 01:47:22,854
Eat 'em, greaser.

1172
01:47:30,821 --> 01:47:34,574
- (hammer cocks)
<i>- Malditos.</i> (spits)

1173
01:47:40,872 --> 01:47:42,958
You had a good life, <i>cholo.</i>

1174
01:47:46,711 --> 01:47:48,421
(laughing)

1175
01:47:50,090 --> 01:47:52,008
(horse whinnies)

1176
01:48:21,496 --> 01:48:22,998
Let's go.

1177
01:48:32,716 --> 01:48:35,844
- Wait here. I'll be right back.
- All right.

1178
01:49:03,914 --> 01:49:05,832
Hey, Longworth!

1179
01:49:13,590 --> 01:49:15,258
Longworth?

1180
01:49:17,719 --> 01:49:19,346
Mornin', Sheriff.

1181
01:49:28,563 --> 01:49:30,482
Rio said to tell you wait here.

1182
01:49:32,192 --> 01:49:35,987
- What for?
- Said he was comin' in to kill you.

1183
01:49:37,948 --> 01:49:39,574
You tell him I'm waiting.

1184
01:49:40,784 --> 01:49:43,161
All right. I'll tell him.

1185
01:50:16,695 --> 01:50:19,114
- MAN: Good morning.
- Good morning.

1186
01:50:21,074 --> 01:50:23,535
Hold on. I'll be right with you.

1187
01:50:23,618 --> 01:50:25,120
Deposit?

1188
01:50:26,371 --> 01:50:27,872
Not hardly.

1189
01:50:29,874 --> 01:50:31,793
Where's your hog leg?

1190
01:50:33,336 --> 01:50:35,380
I ain't got none.

1191
01:50:35,463 --> 01:50:37,924
You ain't got none?

1192
01:50:38,008 --> 01:50:39,634
You better dig one up.

1193
01:50:40,844 --> 01:50:42,345
(hammer cocks)

1194
01:50:43,263 --> 01:50:45,098
Right there.

1195
01:50:45,181 --> 01:50:48,184
(chuckling) Pretty fancy.

1196
01:50:50,603 --> 01:50:53,523
Give me the paper. Forget the hard stuff.

1197
01:50:59,112 --> 01:51:01,781
Good morning, Mr. Carvey.
Has my father been here yet?

1198
01:51:01,865 --> 01:51:03,658
He was here a little while ago.

1199
01:51:04,659 --> 01:51:07,704
Now, honey, you're gonna be
a real good little girl, ain't you?

1200
01:51:07,787 --> 01:51:10,915
You're not gonna scream, and you're
not gonna run out of here, are you?

1201
01:51:10,999 --> 01:51:12,000
(quietly) No.

1202
01:51:12,083 --> 01:51:15,754
Then you get over there in the corner,
and sit down, and you won't get hurt.

1203
01:51:15,837 --> 01:51:19,257
Now, you better get busy
or I'll blow your liver out.

1204
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:32,228
That's it.

1205
01:51:36,316 --> 01:51:37,650
I'll take that.

1206
01:51:48,912 --> 01:51:49,912
- (gunshot)
- (screams)

1207
01:51:49,954 --> 01:51:51,414
(gunfire)

1208
01:51:56,586 --> 01:52:00,673
- What do you reckon that was, Lon?
- It ain't the Fourth of July. Let's go.

1209
01:52:02,801 --> 01:52:04,761
Harv.

1210
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:10,517
- MAN: Hey, Barney?
- Yeah.

1211
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,435
- Where's Longworth?
- I don't know.

1212
01:52:12,519 --> 01:52:14,604
- What happened?
- I been shot.

1213
01:52:17,482 --> 01:52:18,983
Whoa!

1214
01:52:19,484 --> 01:52:20,777
- Hi, Sheriff.
- Hello, Dad.

1215
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:24,030
Dad, all hell broke loose back in town.

1216
01:52:24,114 --> 01:52:25,907
They shot up everything.

1217
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:28,827
I run one clean out of town.
I done the best I could.

1218
01:52:28,910 --> 01:52:31,996
- Tell me what happened.
- They held up the bank. That's what happened.

1219
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:34,249
- Who did?
- Rio's bunch.

1220
01:52:34,332 --> 01:52:37,043
The teller got Bob Amory,
and the other one got away.

1221
01:52:37,836 --> 01:52:40,547
They killed the little Ames girl.

1222
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:42,424
What about Rio?

1223
01:52:42,507 --> 01:52:44,551
Didn't see him.

1224
01:52:46,428 --> 01:52:48,263
Smart.

1225
01:52:48,930 --> 01:52:51,474
Thought maybe they got you.
That's why I come out here.

1226
01:52:51,558 --> 01:52:54,602
They got me, all right.
I'll be right back.

1227
01:52:59,441 --> 01:53:02,819
(chattering)

1228
01:53:03,445 --> 01:53:05,280
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1229
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,386
Hold it, Rio.

1230
01:54:11,763 --> 01:54:13,973
Get your hands up slow.

1231
01:54:16,309 --> 01:54:18,394
(chattering)

1232
01:54:22,690 --> 01:54:24,108
MAN: You're all right, Dad!

1233
01:54:24,192 --> 01:54:26,694
CARVEY: Dad, I didn't mean to
take the law into my hands,

1234
01:54:26,778 --> 01:54:28,780
but I did what any person would do.

1235
01:54:28,863 --> 01:54:32,450
MAN #2: Take care of this one, Dad.
I want to fix his wagon.

1236
01:54:32,867 --> 01:54:36,079
(shouting continues)

1237
01:54:44,796 --> 01:54:48,174
- MAN: Take the bucket away.
- RIO: I don't need the bucket. You know that?

1238
01:54:48,258 --> 01:54:50,802
LON: Who'd he ever stand up to later?

1239
01:54:50,885 --> 01:54:52,971
Get up there!

1240
01:54:53,054 --> 01:54:56,808
- Cut that out.
- Shoot. I seen the big whupping you give him.

1241
01:55:05,483 --> 01:55:07,110
- Get him!
- Stop!

1242
01:55:07,193 --> 01:55:09,696
- Get him.
- I'll remember this.

1243
01:55:09,779 --> 01:55:11,739
You'll remember nothing. Now, get back!

1244
01:55:11,823 --> 01:55:13,533
RIO: You're gonna get yours.

1245
01:55:13,616 --> 01:55:15,660
Hear me?

1246
01:55:15,743 --> 01:55:17,370
You'll get him, Lon.

1247
01:55:20,832 --> 01:55:24,669
Oh, no. Come in. Hurry it up.

1248
01:55:27,630 --> 01:55:29,632
Hurry up. Come on. Outside.

1249
01:55:31,134 --> 01:55:32,510
That's all.

1250
01:55:35,221 --> 01:55:37,223
You too, Lon.

1251
01:55:47,609 --> 01:55:49,319
Well, that's it, kid.

1252
01:55:55,867 --> 01:55:58,161
I guess there's nothing more to say.

1253
01:56:07,086 --> 01:56:08,588
Dad.

1254
01:56:10,423 --> 01:56:11,924
Got a minute?

1255
01:56:14,469 --> 01:56:16,095
Sure, kid.

1256
01:56:24,437 --> 01:56:28,983
You know I didn't send Bob Amory
in there to tell you to stay home.

1257
01:56:30,693 --> 01:56:33,488
Well, I could be wrong.

1258
01:56:34,739 --> 01:56:38,326
But then I'm not going to be judging you.
Those folks out there will.

1259
01:56:38,409 --> 01:56:40,244
They'll be your jury.

1260
01:56:41,996 --> 01:56:44,916
You're dying to get me hung, ain't you?

1261
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:47,585
No, kid.

1262
01:56:47,669 --> 01:56:50,380
You've been trying to get yourself hung
for the past ten years,

1263
01:56:50,463 --> 01:56:52,965
and this time
I think you're gonna make it.

1264
01:56:54,092 --> 01:56:56,469
You should have quit when you were ahead.

1265
01:56:59,263 --> 01:57:00,890
Like you, huh?

1266
01:57:02,266 --> 01:57:04,560
Mm-hmm. Like me.

1267
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:09,565
You're a one-eyed jack around here, Dad.

1268
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:13,528
I seen the other side of your face.

1269
01:57:17,323 --> 01:57:20,410
You know where I spent
the last five years?

1270
01:57:26,207 --> 01:57:30,211
Rottin' my guts out
down in that pen in Sonora.

1271
01:57:33,172 --> 01:57:35,258
Now, what you think of that?

1272
01:57:37,927 --> 01:57:40,138
I think you're lying.

1273
01:57:41,764 --> 01:57:44,684
Faster than a dog can trot.

1274
01:57:46,978 --> 01:57:49,897
I am gonna get a trial, ain't I, Dad?

1275
01:57:49,981 --> 01:57:53,651
Oh, sure, kid, sure.
You'll get a fair trial.

1276
01:57:58,114 --> 01:58:02,034
And then I'm gonna hang you, personally.

1277
01:58:23,055 --> 01:58:24,557
Rio?

1278
01:58:27,268 --> 01:58:29,187
I had to come.

1279
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:35,985
I'm glad you did.

1280
01:58:37,236 --> 01:58:39,363
I was kind of hoping you would.

1281
01:58:40,323 --> 01:58:43,701
You're lookin' fine. Just fine.

1282
01:58:45,328 --> 01:58:49,207
Maybe if we had seen each other again,

1283
01:58:49,290 --> 01:58:51,125
you would change your mind.

1284
01:58:52,043 --> 01:58:54,754
Louisa, I wasn't coming in after Dad.

1285
01:58:55,755 --> 01:58:58,633
And I don't know nothin' about that bank.

1286
01:59:01,344 --> 01:59:04,180
I was coming in to take you away with me.

1287
01:59:05,973 --> 01:59:08,601
I was gonna ask you to be my wife.

1288
01:59:08,684 --> 01:59:10,394
It is true?

1289
01:59:11,771 --> 01:59:13,981
I ain't got no time for lyin'.

1290
01:59:16,901 --> 01:59:18,736
Listen to me.

1291
01:59:23,491 --> 01:59:25,701
I want to tell you something.

1292
01:59:29,205 --> 01:59:31,207
I am going to have your baby.

1293
01:59:34,418 --> 01:59:36,796
Why didn't you tell me before?

1294
01:59:36,879 --> 01:59:39,048
Because I was afraid.

1295
01:59:39,924 --> 01:59:42,260
I thought that you don't want.

1296
01:59:42,343 --> 01:59:44,387
No.

1297
01:59:45,096 --> 01:59:47,473
He will be something wonderful...

1298
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:51,352
because he is our love.

1299
01:59:52,228 --> 01:59:54,730
And you will be very proud of him.

1300
01:59:57,775 --> 01:59:59,652
I love you, Louisa.

1301
02:00:01,362 --> 02:00:04,365
I never did get a chance to say it.

1302
02:00:07,034 --> 02:00:09,287
I want you to know something, that...

1303
02:00:11,205 --> 02:00:13,249
I'll be thinking about you tomorrow.

1304
02:00:13,875 --> 02:00:15,501
Don't say that.

1305
02:00:18,337 --> 02:00:20,840
They will listen to you at the trial...

1306
02:00:21,841 --> 02:00:25,511
and they will know that you are innocent.

1307
02:00:25,595 --> 02:00:27,471
But you must believe that.

1308
02:00:28,681 --> 02:00:30,182
You bet.

1309
02:00:32,602 --> 02:00:34,103
LON: All right. Let's go.

1310
02:00:36,314 --> 02:00:37,815
Come on.

1311
02:00:39,775 --> 02:00:42,570
Sorry to have to break up
this little Valentine.

1312
02:00:42,653 --> 02:00:44,363
You heard me.

1313
02:00:52,288 --> 02:00:53,915
Step back.

1314
02:00:54,916 --> 02:00:56,918
Turn around.

1315
02:00:57,001 --> 02:01:00,296
Get ahold of them bars.
Keep your feet back.

1316
02:01:08,012 --> 02:01:10,890
There ain't no call for that, Lon.
What's the matter with you?

1317
02:01:10,973 --> 02:01:13,976
Nothin'. Just sorry the county's
gonna take care of him.

1318
02:01:14,060 --> 02:01:17,688
I'd like to do it myself, with this,

1319
02:01:17,772 --> 02:01:20,900
with both barrels of double-aught shot
about waist high.

1320
02:01:21,484 --> 02:01:22,985
Want to?

1321
02:01:24,862 --> 02:01:27,198
Let's see you pull it, Lon.

1322
02:01:28,491 --> 02:01:29,992
All right.

1323
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:34,956
Go ahead.

1324
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:37,124
Make a try for it.

1325
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,920
There ain't no need for that, Lon.

1326
02:01:41,003 --> 02:01:43,839
All you got to do is just squeeze one off.

1327
02:01:43,923 --> 02:01:47,176
Go on. You're supposed to
have so much guts.

1328
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:50,846
Mm-mmm.

1329
02:01:50,930 --> 02:01:53,557
You're the one with the gut, Lon.

1330
02:02:00,564 --> 02:02:04,318
Second thought, maybe it'd be more fun
to wait till tomorrow.

1331
02:02:05,152 --> 02:02:07,989
How's your face gonna look?

1332
02:02:08,072 --> 02:02:11,450
All turnin' black,

1333
02:02:11,534 --> 02:02:14,328
and your tongue is stickin' out.

1334
02:02:16,038 --> 02:02:18,624
Why don't you just
shut your big mouth, Lon?

1335
02:02:18,708 --> 02:02:21,544
Why don't you tend to your own business?

1336
02:02:29,385 --> 02:02:31,929
You're forgettin' one thing, Lon.

1337
02:02:32,013 --> 02:02:34,306
Yeah? What's that?

1338
02:02:35,349 --> 02:02:37,101
Ain't hung yet.

1339
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:39,770
Yeah, but you will be, brother.

1340
02:02:39,854 --> 02:02:42,565
You ain't gettin' no older than tomorrow.

1341
02:02:44,108 --> 02:02:45,609
Oh, say.

1342
02:02:48,904 --> 02:02:51,782
Let's don't forget about her.

1343
02:02:51,866 --> 02:02:55,619
I'll be taking care of that
before they cut you down.

1344
02:02:56,996 --> 02:02:59,540
- You gob of spit.
- (laughing)

1345
02:03:00,541 --> 02:03:03,169
I sure am, ain't I? (laughing)

1346
02:03:05,504 --> 02:03:07,423
You watch yourself.

1347
02:03:18,976 --> 02:03:21,187
What's the matter? Aren't you hungry?

1348
02:03:23,272 --> 02:03:25,274
What is going to happen to him?

1349
02:03:26,358 --> 02:03:28,360
What's going to happen to who?

1350
02:03:30,529 --> 02:03:32,948
Is he really going to be hanged?

1351
02:03:33,032 --> 02:03:34,575
Oh, of course he is.

1352
02:03:34,658 --> 02:03:37,953
Could it be that you have your own reasons
for wanting him to die?

1353
02:03:38,954 --> 02:03:41,957
No. No reasons at all.

1354
02:03:42,041 --> 02:03:46,462
He just, uh, robbed the bank
and killed a little girl, that's all.

1355
02:03:48,047 --> 02:03:50,174
Why do you ask?

1356
02:03:50,966 --> 02:03:54,470
I hear you might have personal reasons.

1357
02:03:54,553 --> 02:03:56,055
Personal reasons?

1358
02:03:57,598 --> 02:03:59,141
Like what?

1359
02:03:59,225 --> 02:04:04,730
Oh, the story about you run away from him
in Mexico and leave him to die.

1360
02:04:06,232 --> 02:04:08,150
Did you?

1361
02:04:08,234 --> 02:04:09,735
Is this truth?

1362
02:04:11,529 --> 02:04:13,531
I've heard that story.

1363
02:04:15,324 --> 02:04:18,869
- Where did you hear it?
- He told Louisa.

1364
02:04:21,539 --> 02:04:23,249
Smart pup.

1365
02:04:23,874 --> 02:04:26,293
It is the truth?

1366
02:04:26,377 --> 02:04:29,463
The truth? Why, he'd choke on the truth.

1367
02:04:30,256 --> 02:04:32,842
What the hell is the matter with you?

1368
02:04:36,762 --> 02:04:38,597
I will tell you.

1369
02:04:41,559 --> 02:04:43,394
Louisa's going to have his baby.

1370
02:04:51,318 --> 02:04:52,820
Yes.

1371
02:05:00,494 --> 02:05:03,122
Please listen to me.

1372
02:05:03,205 --> 02:05:06,041
You have been good to us,
and I'm grateful.

1373
02:05:06,125 --> 02:05:10,713
But if I talk to you so, it's because
I don't want my daughter to suffer as I did.

1374
02:05:11,714 --> 02:05:14,967
- Then you lied to me that morning.
- Yes, I lied to you, but...

1375
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:18,053
Shut up!

1376
02:05:19,138 --> 02:05:23,434
Is this the thanks I get
for taking you out of the bean fields

1377
02:05:23,517 --> 02:05:25,769
and giving you respectability?

1378
02:05:25,853 --> 02:05:28,814
I gave you the clothes on your back.

1379
02:05:28,898 --> 02:05:30,941
And I gave you a roof over your head.

1380
02:05:31,025 --> 02:05:32,526
And what's more,

1381
02:05:33,903 --> 02:05:36,447
I gave your daughter my name.

1382
02:05:36,530 --> 02:05:38,157
Mine.

1383
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:40,284
When she had none of her own.

1384
02:05:40,367 --> 02:05:42,995
Everything you say is truth.

1385
02:05:44,079 --> 02:05:47,875
But now she needs your help
more than ever.

1386
02:05:47,958 --> 02:05:49,460
Help?

1387
02:05:50,794 --> 02:05:52,713
Yeah.

1388
02:05:52,796 --> 02:05:54,673
I'll help.

1389
02:05:56,675 --> 02:06:00,054
It's taken me five years
to build this decent life.

1390
02:06:00,137 --> 02:06:03,224
- I'm not gonna let him ruin —
- Killing him will not help!

1391
02:06:03,307 --> 02:06:04,934
- Let go my arms.
- Please.

1392
02:06:05,017 --> 02:06:07,102
- Let go of my hand!
- Please!

1393
02:06:11,982 --> 02:06:15,527
- He's guilty, and he's gonna pay.
- Don't lie to me anymore.

1394
02:06:15,611 --> 02:06:19,198
I saw it on your face
since the first day he came here.

1395
02:06:20,407 --> 02:06:23,994
Your hatred is more important to you
than anything,

1396
02:06:24,078 --> 02:06:25,704
including our own lives.

1397
02:06:25,788 --> 02:06:30,000
And you will do anything to hide
that memory of what you did to him,

1398
02:06:30,668 --> 02:06:32,294
even to kill.

1399
02:06:34,129 --> 02:06:37,258
I told you to shut up.

1400
02:06:37,341 --> 02:06:41,053
His execution will be a day earlier.
That's all.

1401
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:47,434
(door opens, closes)

1402
02:06:51,689 --> 02:06:54,984
♪♪ (Lon vocalizing)

1403
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:13,794
What do you think you're doing up here?
Get on back down them stairs.

1404
02:07:13,877 --> 02:07:15,879
I brought him something to eat.

1405
02:07:17,923 --> 02:07:19,591
Tell you what.

1406
02:07:19,675 --> 02:07:24,305
Why don't you just trot on home,
'cause you ain't gonna give him nothin'.

1407
02:07:24,388 --> 02:07:29,059
My father told me to bring this,
and you're supposed to give it to him.

1408
02:07:29,143 --> 02:07:31,812
He never said nothin' to me about it.

1409
02:07:32,479 --> 02:07:36,608
All right. I'll tell him that you refused.

1410
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:42,865
Wait a minute.

1411
02:07:48,412 --> 02:07:50,247
Let me see it.

1412
02:07:57,129 --> 02:08:00,507
- What do you got in here anyhow?
- That's just some stew.

1413
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:04,970
Just take a little peek.

1414
02:08:05,054 --> 02:08:07,306
You're not supposed to touch that.

1415
02:08:28,118 --> 02:08:30,537
- I love you, Rio!
- LON: Come here, you little runt.

1416
02:08:30,621 --> 02:08:33,374
I love you! I love you!

1417
02:08:34,750 --> 02:08:36,960
Now get back!

1418
02:08:37,044 --> 02:08:38,712
Take your hands off her!

1419
02:08:39,797 --> 02:08:41,548
Get your damn hands off her!

1420
02:08:41,632 --> 02:08:43,258
<i>¡Suelta!</i>

1421
02:08:45,761 --> 02:08:49,181
<i>¡Suéltame, animal! ¡Suéltame!</i>

1422
02:08:49,264 --> 02:08:52,142
- I'll stick a fork in you!
<i>- ¡Suelta!</i>

1423
02:08:52,226 --> 02:08:56,021
I'm taking you out of here and let Tim
keep you till your daddy gets back.

1424
02:08:56,105 --> 02:08:58,732
(Lon, Louisa shouting, faint)

1425
02:09:07,366 --> 02:09:09,284
(mutters)

1426
02:11:39,059 --> 02:11:41,395
(door opens, closes)

1427
02:11:44,606 --> 02:11:47,109
(footsteps on stairs)

1428
02:11:54,032 --> 02:11:55,659
That's right, Lon.

1429
02:11:55,742 --> 02:11:57,911
Now, up in here right quick.

1430
02:11:57,995 --> 02:12:01,748
I count eight, and I ain't got them keys,

1431
02:12:01,832 --> 02:12:04,042
I'm gonna take you off at the neck.

1432
02:12:04,126 --> 02:12:05,961
One.

1433
02:12:06,044 --> 02:12:09,423
You ain't about to take my neck off
with that little old popper.

1434
02:12:09,506 --> 02:12:10,841
That's two.

1435
02:12:11,842 --> 02:12:13,635
You'll be lucky if you hit the wall.

1436
02:12:13,719 --> 02:12:15,178
Three.

1437
02:12:17,514 --> 02:12:21,393
I might get shot up a little bit
diving down these stairs,

1438
02:12:21,476 --> 02:12:24,021
but you're gonna hang any way you put it.

1439
02:12:25,147 --> 02:12:27,190
Four.

1440
02:12:27,274 --> 02:12:30,861
- You're runnin' a bluff, and I'm gonna call you.
- Five.

1441
02:12:31,987 --> 02:12:33,905
Go ahead. Try it, Lon.

1442
02:12:34,948 --> 02:12:36,199
Six.

1443
02:12:37,784 --> 02:12:41,246
All I gotta do is duck a little bit,
and you're done.

1444
02:12:42,331 --> 02:12:43,707
Seven.

1445
02:12:47,919 --> 02:12:50,213
- That's eight.
- I'm comin'.

1446
02:12:57,471 --> 02:12:59,306
Open that door.

1447
02:13:00,932 --> 02:13:02,643
Easy now.

1448
02:13:05,937 --> 02:13:08,357
Now turn around
and come in here backwards.

1449
02:13:10,067 --> 02:13:13,862
Step in here.
Left hand. Take that belt off.

1450
02:13:19,242 --> 02:13:21,244
Down on your knees.

1451
02:13:24,331 --> 02:13:27,793
Lookee here, Lon. Wasn't loaded.

1452
02:13:27,876 --> 02:13:29,711
Get back, you.

1453
02:13:33,590 --> 02:13:35,592
Get them keys out.

1454
02:13:40,222 --> 02:13:42,057
Take them chains off.

1455
02:13:46,353 --> 02:13:49,981
- Now —
- Oh, please, God, don't kill me.

1456
02:13:50,065 --> 02:13:53,568
You remember, Lon?
I told you I ain't hung yet.

1457
02:13:53,652 --> 02:13:56,071
- I don't want to die!
- How you gonna look?

1458
02:13:56,154 --> 02:13:58,615
How you gonna look, Lon?

1459
02:13:58,699 --> 02:14:01,993
Kickin' and snappin',
spittin' out your blood.

1460
02:14:02,077 --> 02:14:04,413
- Oh, please, don't kill me. Don't.
- Huh?

1461
02:14:04,496 --> 02:14:06,456
Get on up here.

1462
02:14:07,165 --> 02:14:09,543
Get on up, Lon. Get up!

1463
02:14:13,964 --> 02:14:16,591
Now just turn around and get your turn.

1464
02:15:16,359 --> 02:15:17,861
Don't move.

1465
02:15:21,156 --> 02:15:22,657
Get up.

1466
02:15:23,825 --> 02:15:25,327
Get up.

1467
02:15:38,298 --> 02:15:41,218
You get in there and send me
the best horse you've got, and quick.

1468
02:15:41,301 --> 02:15:43,845
I ain't got any. They're all gone.

1469
02:15:43,929 --> 02:15:46,264
You're gonna die if you're lyin'.

1470
02:15:48,850 --> 02:15:52,562
Get — Turn around, you.
Put your hands down.

1471
02:16:15,877 --> 02:16:17,712
- (grunts)
- (body thuds)

1472
02:16:23,260 --> 02:16:27,097
- McKittrick around?
- No. He's over to the saloon.

1473
02:16:27,180 --> 02:16:28,682
Oh.

1474
02:16:34,271 --> 02:16:37,107
Help! Help, somebody!

1475
02:16:37,190 --> 02:16:39,109
Help! Tim!

1476
02:16:39,192 --> 02:16:41,444
- Get off that horse.
- (woman gasps)

1477
02:16:41,528 --> 02:16:44,447
(Lon shouting) Somebody help!
Help! He's gettin' away!

1478
02:16:44,531 --> 02:16:45,866
Help!

1479
02:16:45,949 --> 02:16:48,702
Dad, it's me up here, Lon!

1480
02:16:50,871 --> 02:16:54,082
- (gunshot)
- (horse whinnies)

1481
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:58,044
- (gunshot)
- (people shouting)

1482
02:17:04,259 --> 02:17:05,969
(gunshot)

1483
02:17:07,220 --> 02:17:09,180
(gunshot)

1484
02:17:49,596 --> 02:17:51,556
You killed Dad!

1485
02:17:52,641 --> 02:17:55,352
It's all over. Wasn't nothin' else to do.

1486
02:17:55,435 --> 02:17:57,187
- Come on.
- No.

1487
02:17:57,270 --> 02:17:59,439
Come on. There's nothin' to do.

1488
02:18:49,948 --> 02:18:51,741
I gotta leave you here, Louisa.

1489
02:18:51,825 --> 02:18:53,994
Yes, you must go now, quickly.

1490
02:18:54,911 --> 02:18:57,956
I want you to tell your mother something.

1491
02:18:58,039 --> 02:19:01,376
I want you to tell her that I tried to run,

1492
02:19:01,459 --> 02:19:04,546
but he didn't give me no chance.

1493
02:19:04,629 --> 02:19:06,423
And tell her I'm —

1494
02:19:07,507 --> 02:19:10,844
Well, just tell her whatever you have to.

1495
02:19:14,764 --> 02:19:16,766
Will you be all right?

1496
02:19:18,059 --> 02:19:19,894
Where can you go now?

1497
02:19:20,603 --> 02:19:23,064
I don't know.

1498
02:19:23,148 --> 02:19:26,443
I'll have to figure that out later.
Maybe Oregon.

1499
02:19:27,610 --> 02:19:30,238
I'll be ridin' for a while anyhow.

1500
02:19:30,321 --> 02:19:34,826
Why don't you go to Mexico?
I could meet you in Sonora in April.

1501
02:19:34,909 --> 02:19:36,536
After my baby comes.

1502
02:19:36,619 --> 02:19:39,039
No, I —

1503
02:19:39,122 --> 02:19:40,874
No.

1504
02:19:40,957 --> 02:19:44,252
They're lookin'
all over hell for me in Mexico.

1505
02:19:44,335 --> 02:19:46,713
That don't matter. Listen.

1506
02:19:46,796 --> 02:19:49,758
You be lookin' for me in the spring.

1507
02:19:49,841 --> 02:19:53,887
One of them dark nights,
you're gonna see a jackass in the window,

1508
02:19:53,970 --> 02:19:56,347
and it's gonna be me.

1509
02:19:57,223 --> 02:19:59,225
Don't worry about it.

1510
02:20:01,227 --> 02:20:02,854
I'll find someplace.

1511
02:20:05,065 --> 02:20:07,525
I better start kickin' now.

1512
02:20:07,609 --> 02:20:09,611
Go. Please, go.

1513
02:20:13,823 --> 02:20:15,450
I love you, Rio.

1514
02:20:18,203 --> 02:20:20,371
Take care of yourself,

1515
02:20:20,455 --> 02:20:23,291
because I'm so afraid to losing you.

1516
02:20:39,224 --> 02:20:41,226
