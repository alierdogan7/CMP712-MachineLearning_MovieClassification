[singing in Spanish]

2
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:13,678
I was 11 years old

3
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:16,942
when general Batista
slaughtered half my village.

4
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,280
I watched him
torture my father

5
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,786
and butcher my mother.

6
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:25,619
The kids that survived,
I took to Juarez.

7
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,092
We roamed the streets
like wolves.

8
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:32,791
I came back the night
of the general's wedding.

9
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,629
Stole his straight razor.

10
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:41,002
The general awoke to the sound
of his own throat being cut.

11
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:45,703
While the general bled,
I sang to him.

12
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:49,543
"'Tis better to whisper
the sun is rising.

13
00:02:49,683 --> 00:02:53,517
'Tis better to whisper
the sun is rising."

[singing in Spanish]

15
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:29,180
There's two kinds of people
in the world, fellas.

16
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,153
There's the wicked...

17
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,423
And the righteous.

18
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:36,495
And it's
the wicked man's job

19
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:39,588
to get
the righteous man's money.

20
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:44,830
This righteous tool here
is used by the wicked

21
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:47,338
to get that money.

22
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:54,006
[speaking Spanish]

23
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:56,082
Sure, they're old.

24
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:57,877
But they shoot true.

25
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:01,385
Now, in the hands of a man
such as Louie Chama, well...

26
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:03,182
it could bring great wealth.

27
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:09,922
- Huh?
[chuckles]

28
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:13,191
You don't fuck
with Louie Chama.

29
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,371

00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:23,271

[gunshot]

41
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:18,464
The last thing Ransom Pride
said to me was,

42
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:22,500
''I was always a lover,
despite the killings.''

43
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:37,773
[laughter]
and indistinct chatter]

44
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:10,144
The body of Ransom Pride
belongs to me.

45
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,744
And I understand there's someone
here who believes otherwise.

46
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:17,755
Mescal?

47
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:20,155
You go on and tell
that broke-dick son of a bitch

48
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,592
he's mistaken.

49
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:28,329
[speaking Spanish]

50
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:32,667
20 pesos,
I stick my dick in you.

51
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:33,704

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,034

56
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:26,754
[grunts]

57
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,724
Hmm.

58
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:31,826
[speaking Spanish]

59
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,511
Your Ransom...

60
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:58,180
he killed a priest.

61
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:04,189
This priest
was my brother by birth.

62
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,094
And although his faith
was misplaced,

63
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,691
he remains my brother
in death.

64
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:11,827
[gunshot]

65
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:19,471
Therefore, the body
of Ransom Pride will be fed

66
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:22,274
to the devil's
black vultures,

67
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:27,718
for there must be
atonement.

68
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,724
He has a brother.

69
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:37,159
So this is your offer?

70
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:38,889
[laughs]

71
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:45,160
A woman willing to buy back
a man's soul...

72
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,074
With the blood
of his brother...

73
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:53,710
Is beyond salvation.

74
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:05,153
The puppies could be
coming out tonight.

75
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:07,818
[slurping]

76
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:10,487
Maybe I should think up
some names for 'em.

77
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:21,731
She's taken to me.

78
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,072
Maybe she thinks
I'm like him.

79
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:32,851
How is it you consider
yourself like Ransom?

80
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:35,919
I'm sorry, Pa.

81
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:37,545
I didn't mean
we're the very same.

82
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,248
I just...

83
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:41,451
- I just think that maybe-
- No, finish what you said.

84
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:42,891
I want to hear
how it is

85
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:45,759
you think
you're like your brother.

86
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,265
Whorin'?

87
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:50,301
Runnin', robbin'?

88
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:57,865
You're right, Pa,
we're nothing alike.

89
00:09:57,977 --> 00:09:59,638
No, you're not alike.

90
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:04,944
And you should
get on your knees

91
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:09,316
and thank the Lord in heaven
you're not like him.

92
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,431
He's coming
to get me, Mama.

93
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:26,129
Hey, Mama.

94
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:29,264
I'm sorry.

She had them pups?

98
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:47,415
She's suffering, Pa.

99
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:50,291
She...
[dog whimpering]

100
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,489
What's wrong
with you?

101
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:54,190
You like to watch
that suffering?

102
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:55,961
What?

103
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:57,626
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.

104
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,761
Come here, sweetie.
Come here, sweetie.

105

- Pa, please, please.
- Come here. Come here.

106
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,702
You know,
what's wrong with you?

107
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:06,209
- Pa.
- Don't you let her suffer.

108
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:07,506
You don't let her-

116
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,636
Where are the dead?

117
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:37,005
I've often wondered.

118
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:41,846
The scripture tells us
where the dead are.

[coughing]

120
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:47,912
Well, see,
my wife...

121
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:59,596
The scripture tells us
what becomes of the dead.

122
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:01,859
all those who go
to their graves unsaved

123
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:03,992
shall know
the torment of hell.

129
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:24,055
Father, I've sinned.

130
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,590
I'm no longer worthy
to be called Thy son.

Don't you dare
quote scripture to me, whore.

00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:37,563

Thessalonians 4:15-1 7.

137
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:48,411
Now, I swore
I'd bury Ransom

138
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:50,709
next to his mother.

139
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:52,284
We owe him.

140
00:12:56,155 --> 00:13:00,387
You owe him, whore.

You listen to me.

145
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:46,161

Oh. Ow.

Oh, no.

150
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,812
No. I'm sorry.

151
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,954
I'll leave. I'll leave.
I'll get out of here.

Sorry about your ma.

154

How did he die?

155
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,611
He got shot.

156
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:10,054
A gun-runnin' deal.

157
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:12,680
Took the first bullet
in the back.

158
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:23,266
This walleyed bastard bitch
claimed the body.

159
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:28,802
There ain't nobody left
but me and you.

160
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:32,536
We'll do this for him.

161
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:35,808
How do we get him back?

162
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:38,473
I got that worked out.

163
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,548
Come on.

164
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:48,252
It's time
you got weaned.

165
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:01,473
This is my father's.

166
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:04,940
Ransom took him
when he left.

167
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:10,071
He should have taken
better care of this horse.

168
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:12,241
Belongs to you now.

169
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:14,649
See that you earn it.

170
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:26,788

Well, well.

Welcome back,
Captain.

183
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:56,446
Or should I say
Reverend?

184
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:59,080
Ransom's whore got him killed
down in Mexico.

185
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:01,955
And now she come back
and took his brother.

The one who killed Edna
when he come out?

187
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:07,459
Graves...

188
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,967
you mention my wife again,

189
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,196
I swear to God,

190
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,535
I'll kill you
with that whore on your lap.

191
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,701
You're the one who put
the blame on him for that.

192
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:24,043
Whore got a name?

193
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:27,752
Yeah.

194
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,915
Juliette Flowers.

195
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:34,651
Goddamn, Captain.

196
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:38,252
I guess she's growing
a conscience.

197
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:41,833
Was a time she'd have
murdered y'all in your sleep.

198
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:46,103
Yeah, in certain parts
of Mexico,

199
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:48,900
they sing corridos
about that half-breed girl.

200
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:50,600
[sighs]
Yeah.

201
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:53,735
[woman singing in Spanish]

202
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:57,805
[gunshot]

203
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:04,619
[breathing heavily]

204
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:07,749
[speaking Spanish]

205
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:11,354
Ain't no place in the world

206
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:13,692
my father hates more
than Mexico.

207
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,132
[woman singing in Spanish]

208
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:19,032
[clicking tongue]

209
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:25,507
Quantrill and bloody Bill said
leave him for dead in Kansas.

210
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:32,214
He was shot up
too bad to ride.

211
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:35,514
What'd I do?

212
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:37,519
Did I leave you, Graves?

213
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:39,556
No.

214
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:41,853
I didn't leave you.

215
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:45,020
Stayed right there
with you.

216
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:47,496
There's a debt here

217
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:50,397
I guess I come to collect.

218
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:52,629
Asking for help...

219
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:55,229
oh, that's
a hard thing to do.

220
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:59,868
I guess you could ask God
to help you.

221
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:05,076
And maybe
the Christ Jesus.

222
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:14,349
I don't need God's help
for this, Graves.

223
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:27,097
I need a son of a bitch.

224
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:30,333
Mr. Graves
wants to see you.

225
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,902
[groaning]

226
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:40,943
Your uncle
has a job for you.

227
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:49,227
Captain, behold
the answer to your prayers.

228
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:51,352
How is it you're
still living, Matthew?

229
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:54,762
You know, you ain't
the only one that Jesus saves.

230
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,131
Matthew was the toughest
son of a bitch.

231
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:04,038
But the meanest
was Early Pride.

232
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:06,441
He had no conscience
whatsoever.

233
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:10,037
[breathing heavily]

234
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,481
God damn it,
you fucking whore.

235
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:15,109
- Who in the hell are you?
- That's my sister's boy.

236
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:17,950
Been here since she passed.

237
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,321
Well, he's disturbing.
I don't like the looks of him.

238
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,587
No, neither do I.

239
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:26,220
Son of a bitch is uglier
than a three-peckered goat.

240
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:28,323
But he don't mind
getting his hands bloody

241
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,764
when a man needs killing.

242
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:31,597
Or a woman.

243
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:34,399
A haIf-breed bitch
name of Juliette Flowers

244
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:36,770
took my boy to Mexico.

245
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:38,740
[chuckling]

246
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:40,505
I-I know her.

247
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:41,840
I know who that is.

248
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:44,142
That's that
Juliette Flowers.

249
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:46,410
She-she-she's that girl-

250
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:48,486
This is kin to you?

251
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:58,259
I don't care
what you do to her.

252
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:06,763
hell, you can stammer her
to death if you want.

253
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:08,100
But you just make sure

254
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:11,005
she ain't breathing
when you finish.

255
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:12,940
Now, get away from me.

256
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:34,991
I heard
he was barely 1 5 years old

257
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:37,694
when he and my uncle rode
into Northfield with McCIuskey.

258
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:40,532
- What, you heard?
- Yeah.

259
00:22:40,673 --> 00:22:42,504
Hell, me and Early was barely
weaned from the tit

260
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:46,008
when we got recruited
by Quantrill.

261
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:47,976
Back then, Shepherd,
he seemed like a man,

262
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,479
but looking at it now, hell,

263
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:51,310
he wasn't much more
than a boy himself.

264
00:22:54,586 --> 00:22:56,520
Well, we killed every man,

265
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:58,418
and we killed every chlid,

266
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:00,354
and we killed
every goddamn dog,

267
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:01,925
and we rode all the women.

268
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:03,551
And when they
couldn't ride no more,

269
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:05,254
we killed them.

270
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:37,290
Reverend's gonna ride down
on us like some kind of hell.

271
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,023
He'll put a strap to me,

272
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:42,100
but he'll kill you.

273
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:43,963
I doubt it.

274
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:47,038
It felt like
he always hated me.

275
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:48,936
'Cause of your mama?

276
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:50,803
It was like I was to blame.

277
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,246
Ransom said
it wasn't my fault.

278
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:02,876
The old man
would get whiskey-ed up

279
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:05,582
and start cussin' me.

280
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,658
Ransom would never let him
lay a hand on me.

281
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,595
After he'd pass out,

282
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:15,427
Ransom would always say,

283
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:17,592
''It ain't your fault.''

284
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:24,306
[chuckles]

285
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:53,628
[woman moaning]

286
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,209
[door clicks open]

287
00:25:16,128 --> 00:25:17,618
Somebody here to see you.

288
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:19,196
Have 'em wait.

289
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:21,663
I'm doing this.

290
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,631
You'll want
to hear this.

291
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:25,327
Now.

292
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,028
Yeah?

293
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:29,970
This man tells me that...

294
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:33,010
Ransom killed a priest
before he died.

295
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:34,578
What?

296
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:36,340
That priest
was the younger brother

297
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:39,541
of a woman they call
Maria la Morena.

298
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:43,314
She kept Ransom's body
in recompense.

299
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:47,586
Apparently,
Juliette Flowers

300
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:51,492
aims to swap out your live boy
for the dead one.

301
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:09,337
[insects chirping]

302
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:17,711
[horse neighing]

303
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,722
Buenos dìas, niña.

304
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:27,024
[speaking Spanish]

305
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:28,565
She's deaf.

306
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,066
She's pretty too.

307
00:26:31,203 --> 00:26:33,899
Dice que es bonita también.

308
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:37,709
[speaking Spanish]

309
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,904
I'll bet
you didn't know,

310
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:45,312
first time they laid eyes
on each other,

311
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,112
when Ransom got throwed
in the same Mexican jall

312
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:50,744
where they was holding
Juliette Flowers.

313
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:52,254
They was fixing
to hang her

314
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:53,949
for gut-stabbing that man

315
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:56,617
beat that whore
to death in Juarez.

316
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:57,956
And Ransom,

317
00:26:58,096 --> 00:26:59,961
Well, he got arrested
for being drunk

318
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:02,589
and pissing
on the statue of some saint.

319
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:04,292
[chuckles]

320
00:27:04,436 --> 00:27:05,767
Hey, when we catch her,

321
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:07,735
don't kill her right away.

322
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,966
Make sure she can't hurt us,
but don't kill her right away.

323
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:12,599
Just...just tie her up.

324
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:14,974
Tie her up
so she can't do nothing.

325
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:18,749
Why weren't you with him?

326
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,943
What the hell of a difference
does that make?

327
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:26,514
He was gonna come back
for you, you know.

328
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:28,819
Yeah, well, he never did.

329
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:30,428
He's supposed to be
looking out for me.

330
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:32,827
Instead, he was running
around Mexico with you.

331
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:56,677
Not now, Ransom.

332
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,628
Show some patience.

333
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:06,357
Patience is a virtue
I do not possess.

334
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:10,400
Yeah, well, you ain't much for
wisdom or temperance, neither.

335
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:27,083
I feel like I'm back in Glory
finishing up his chores.

336
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:28,686
For whatever reason,

337
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,550
he honestly believed
certain tasks were beneath him.

338
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,181
''A man with vision
can't be bothered

339
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:37,318
by pissant detalls.''

340
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,897
How many times
I hear that?

341
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:44,726
That goddamn ranch
in Michoacàn.

342
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,428
Never even been there,

343
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:48,869
but he'd get it in his head
we were gonna get it.

344
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:50,338
When we got it,
he was gonna get you

345
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:52,069
and bring you down here.

346
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:55,744
His pride
wouldn't let him get you

347
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:57,508
when he was hiding out,

348
00:28:57,616 --> 00:28:59,243
sleeping in caves.

349
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:04,283
[exhales]

350
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:07,256
[vehicle approaching]

351
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:11,960
I'll hide the horses.

352
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:44,985
[breathing heavily]

353
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:50,424
You got any whiskey?

354
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,901
[gun cocks]

355
00:29:56,675 --> 00:29:59,075
You got any whiskey?

356
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:10,750
I-I-I tell ya-

357
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:12,824
I'll tell ya
one thing, Matthew.

358
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:16,792
That Ransom Pride
was a lucky son of a bitch.

359
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:19,692
He killed a federal judge
back in Tyler.

360
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,458
He jumped out
a second-story window,

361
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,591
didn't even break his foot.

362
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,135
He was a lucky
son of a bitch.

363
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,760
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

364
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:28,430
Serves him right
for trying to do

365
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,202
a gun-running deal
by hisself.

366
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:33,777
Shouldn't go and do
something like that.

367
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:35,346
Whoa.

368
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,607
What?

369
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:40,685
You think they've been here?
They've been here, haven't they?

370
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:43,185
Hyah, hyah, hyah.

371
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:47,488
Wherever you are,

372
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:50,493
good enough place as any
to start over.

373
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,498
I'm ready to start over.

374
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:06,075
Now, how are you
gonna start over?

375
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:08,338
You ain't even
begun to start.

376
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,574
This is as good
a time as any.

377
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:22,217
If you're gonna
start something,

378
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,726
by God, you ought to...

379
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:29,065
You ought to finish it.
[gasping]

380
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,829
And whatever you do,

381
00:31:31,937 --> 00:31:34,167
it better goddamn
be worth it.

382
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:36,162
[gasping]

383
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:43,211
'Cause when you-

384
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:46,511
when you make an investment,

385
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:48,677
a commitment...

386
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:53,181
You follow through.

387
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,723
You know the difference
between an investment

388
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:04,596
and a commitment?

389
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:07,534
Hmm? Yeah.

390
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:10,437
You take a plate
of ham and eggs.

391
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:13,874
Now, the chicken...

392
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:15,708
is invested.

393
00:32:15,814 --> 00:32:17,577
The pig...

394
00:32:17,716 --> 00:32:18,705
is committed.

395
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:20,478
[snickers]

396
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:22,143
[laughs]

397
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:29,817
[laughter continues]

398
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:38,932
If I had my life
to live over,

399
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:43,268
I would live very, very little
of it the same.

400
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:45,774
When you hear folks say

401
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,243
that they wouldn't change
their life,

402
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:52,077
I think they're either
liars or fools.

403
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:55,152
Life is about learning.

404
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:58,120
And if you respect life

405
00:32:58,256 --> 00:33:00,656
and you learn from it,

406
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:05,786
you would, of course,
not do things the same way.

407
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,329
To start with,

408
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:11,128
if I had my life
to live over,

409
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:14,261
I would never say no
to a woman.

410
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:17,205
And I would do nothing

411
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:19,173
purely for money.

412
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:35,221
If we were to sell
them pistols in Tres Piedras...

413
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,193
How dare you heat me up
for the sole purpose

414
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,299
of selling
some shitty old gun?

415
00:33:43,535 --> 00:33:45,696
We won't be in Tres Piedras
more than a couple of hours.

416
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:47,236
Oh, I ain't going.

417
00:33:47,372 --> 00:33:49,499
Ride in.

418
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:52,235
We do the deal.

419
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:53,537
Then we ride out.

420
00:33:53,678 --> 00:33:55,373
I ain't going.

421
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:56,741
Well, I gave him my word.

422
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:59,748
Yeah, you gave your word
to Louie Chama.

423
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:03,913
You gave him your word
before talking to me.

424
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:16,027
[speaking Spanish]

425
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:17,259
What'd he say?

426
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,199
He wasn't talking to you.

427
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:32,012
Hola, chiquita.

428
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:34,609
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

429
00:34:34,753 --> 00:34:36,050
Huh?

430
00:34:36,187 --> 00:34:39,020
Have you seen
Juliette Flowers?

431
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:42,753
Oh, you're a pretty girl.

432
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,293
Yeah, I know you have,

433
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,294
you little fucking whore.

434
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:47,557
Huh?

435
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,530
You seen her,
you fucking whore?

436
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:51,226
We don't have time

437
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:54,133
for you to go
wetting your pecker.

438
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:56,968
You gonna kill somebody,
you show some goddamn respect.

439
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:01,439
Put your little
pig sticker

440
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:03,706
back in your britches
and remount.

441
00:35:07,786 --> 00:35:09,048
[speaking Spanish]

442
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:16,822
Remount.

443
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:32,501
[speaking Spanish]

444
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:38,905
[gasps]

445
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:57,090
[fire crackling]

446
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:09,879
[footsteps]

447
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:13,006
[wind howling]

448
00:36:15,553 --> 00:36:18,545
[snoring]

449
00:36:20,492 --> 00:36:21,982
[horse whinnies]

450
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:24,117

[wheezing]

455
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,526
[speaking Spanish]

456
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:03,759
[wheezing]

457
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:11,902
Hang on, son.

458
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:13,772
- Hold still.
- What are you doing?

459
00:37:13,912 --> 00:37:15,174
Here.
[knife clicks]

460
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,440
What the hell
are you doing?

461
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:18,776
His windpipe's
crushed.

462
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:20,714
Got to stick this tube
down his throat,

463
00:37:20,852 --> 00:37:23,116
or he'll choke to death
on his own blood.

464
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:24,915
[wheezing]

465
00:37:25,056 --> 00:37:27,286
Hold his head.
Easy, son.

466
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,120
[gasping]

467
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:33,859
[panting]

468
00:37:33,965 --> 00:37:36,729
Hang on, son.
Hang on.

469
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:37,857
[faint squeak]

470
00:37:43,107 --> 00:37:44,540
[coughs]

471
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:46,576
An hour southwest of here,
there's a man.

472
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,145
Now, he ain't exactly
a surgeon,

473
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,908
but he can keep
a rooster allve.

474
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,642
[wheezing]

475
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:55,446
Son, you're gonna
be okay.

476
00:37:55,587 --> 00:37:56,747
You're gonna be
just fine.

477
00:37:56,888 --> 00:37:58,082
Now, I need you
to get to your feet.

478
00:37:58,222 --> 00:37:59,450
Come on.
[grunts]

479
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:01,889
Let's stand.
Stand up.

480
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:05,156
Come on.
You can do it, son.

481
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:09,258
[grunts]

482
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,890
I'll get the horses.

483
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:40,122
[horse whinnies]

484
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:51,334
What the hell you doing?

485
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:53,307
What the hell you want
with that for?

486
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:55,105
Because I want it.

487
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:00,447
And when we kill that whore,

488
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:02,644
I'm gonna cut
something off of her too.

489
00:39:02,787 --> 00:39:04,277
Like hell you will.

490
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:05,822
He said kill her,
that's all.

491
00:39:05,957 --> 00:39:07,481
Didn't say nothin'
about cutting her.

492
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:09,058
You want to make a black ass
fool out of yourself,

493
00:39:09,193 --> 00:39:10,160
you go right ahead.

494
00:39:10,294 --> 00:39:13,229
If you shame me,
I will kill you.

495
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:23,830
[engine idles and stops]

496
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:30,310
This ain't it,
but we got to chance it.

497
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:32,315
The boy's hurtin'.

498
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:48,757
We got a boy out here
tore up bad.

499
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,198
He's in a lot of pain.

500
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:52,859
We have something
for pain.

501
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,918
[weapon clicks]

502
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:10,680
My name is Cerce.

503
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:12,756
And this
is my brother Solomon.

504
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:16,783
He's dying.

505
00:40:22,934 --> 00:40:24,925
[grunts softly]

506
00:41:06,778 --> 00:41:10,475
Now, do you mind
if I inquire

507
00:41:10,615 --> 00:41:13,982
if y'all got
any particular destination,

508
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:18,487
or y'all just wanderin' around
out here?

509
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:20,921
- [urinating]
- Tres Piedras.

510
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:23,926
Every equinox, we are obligated
to make a pilgrimage

511
00:41:24,028 --> 00:41:26,462
to this festering parcel
of land,

512
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:28,326
where we perform

513
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:30,627
for illiterate imbeciles
and pathetic whores,

514
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:33,293
and they mock us.

515
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:34,495
[flies buzzing]

516
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,334
Why?

517
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:38,806
Four 6s beats
Jacks over Queens.

518
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,433
[belt buckle clinks]

519
00:41:42,713 --> 00:41:46,672
You mean somebody won you
in a card game?

520
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:48,877
Maria la Morena.

521
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:54,549
There's a vicious,
hungry evil

522
00:41:54,692 --> 00:41:59,493
feeding on Solomon's poor,
wretched bones.

523
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,498
He'll expire first.

524
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:05,829
Then I will pass away.

525
00:42:07,638 --> 00:42:10,835
And in those last few moments
before I die...

526
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:15,678
For the first time
in my life,

527
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:18,646
I shall be alone.

528
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:37,757
After she died, something dark
and vicious come on him.

529
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:39,199
[gunshot, indistinct shouting]

530
00:42:39,337 --> 00:42:40,998
The old man, he just up
and cracked in two.

531
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:42,697
Son of a bitch
used to take us

532
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,364
to this old prairie dog town
north of Glory

533
00:42:44,508 --> 00:42:45,998
with a couple .22 rifles.

534
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,873
Now, I didn't mind killing
the little critters,

535
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:49,604
but Champ...

536
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:51,237
tore them up
something fierce.

537
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:52,940
[indistinct shouting]

538
00:42:53,084 --> 00:42:56,451
Goddamn,
Champ could shoot.

539
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:16,696
[water running]

540
00:43:19,243 --> 00:43:21,404

it'll be as strangers.

No.

It's worse you're the one
pulled the trigger.

We need to change
your bandages.

You listen to me.

named Shepherd Graves.

the other way around,

through the cracks onto me.

797
01:05:31,307 --> 01:05:35,437
And I hollered out,
''We're down here.''

798
01:05:35,578 --> 01:05:38,206
When they looked down,
Matthew grabbed the hatchet,

swung it at that Yankee,

800
01:05:40,216 --> 01:05:44,084

is letting you live
at Tres Piedras.

819
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:55,681
