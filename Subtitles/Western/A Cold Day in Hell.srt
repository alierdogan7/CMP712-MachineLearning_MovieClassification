00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,792
You must be Rivers.
- That is correct.

7
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,796
Scarsdale said you would come.
This is Jacobs.

8
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:20,737
Maybe he wants to participate.

9
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,241
These days you can earn a lot
If you participate with Scarsdale's men.

10
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,780
That's right.
For us they keep a spot Fri

11
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,615
Why do not you come along?
- There is another way, friend.

12
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:35,287
And what way is that?
- A more secure than yours.

13
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,221
I see you in Paradise Junction.

14
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,344
Your hands where I can see you, son.

15
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:11,522
The money. Now.
- I do not have much money.

16
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:15,720
This is a trading post.
We usually exchange.

17
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:21,396
Listen, kid. you only
one second before I shoot.

18
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:26,098
I suggest you my friend
give all the money that you do have ...

19
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,039
otherwise he is capable of you
to shoot.

20
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,837
If you kill that guy ...

21
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:39,175
it means that I am the mountain
it needs to buy my goods.

22
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,421
I do not want to.

23
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,337
I know you from somewhere?

24
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,173
No.

25
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:22,804
The legend of William Drayton.
The longest shot.

Paradise Junction
Elevation: 1,450 meters

27
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,943
The gallows is effective.

28
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:06,374
Crude, but effective.
- Yes, coarse.

29
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,853
Mr. Scarsdale, do you think
necessary?

30
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:13,057
What if the authorities heard of ...
- I am the authority.

31
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,821
And I intend this
young man as an example ...

32
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,828
to the rest of my men
to clarify ...

33
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,398
that disobedience
not be tolerated.

34
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,297
The sheriff will be there?

35
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,233
Mr. Scarsdale,
may I ask you something?

36
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,038
What's so important
that train?

37
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,414
Are you kidding me?
That train is everything.

38
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,680
You'll see that though Payton is here.
- What did that all by themselves?

39
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,312
Rails and bars, enough for
to proceed with construction.

40
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,413
Plus plenty of drinks for the boys.

41
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,358
Maybe even that glass I
I ordered the window of my bank.

42
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:53,156
You have planned well, huh?
- You bet.

43
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,940
He's just a boy.

44
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,811
Somebody help him.
He's just a boy.

45
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,908
Do this, please, do not.

46
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,118
Let it be known that this man
will hang until death follows it.

47
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,557
No, he's just a boy.

48
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,295
Somebody help him.

49
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,391
Take me in his place.
Please, someone help him.

50
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,994
No.

51
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,039
No.

52
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,919
It's about time.

53
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,622
I'm sorry. Please let me know
if you still need something.

54
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,576
I will.

55
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,368
You have to do something for me, Jack.

56
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,031
I want you to
Scardale's men added.

57
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,074
I need to know what they're up to.

58
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:16,311
That's a tough group.
How far do you want me to go?

59
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,212
What do you mean that?

60
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:22,913
What if they enter the village
and mow down people in cold blood.

61
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,853
Would you think I participate?

62
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:31,328
View from moment to moment.

63
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,490
Of course, when it comes to women
and children, then ...

64
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,999
Really?
- Yes.

65
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:41,402
And what if they were not involved?
Do I murder innocent people?

66
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,839
Of course not.

67
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,243
Try to avoid bloodshed.

68
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:52,875
And, in any case, do not let anyone
you know that the law represents.

69
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:58,048
Because if that happens,
it's done to you.

70
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,682
You told me all that
would not be easy.

71
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:06,460
I have told you.
I changed my mind.
 

72
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,463
Yes, sir?
 

73
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:14,071
Give me a beer.
- No problem.
 

74
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,651
I am tired of the law.
 
74
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,879
So I have my own marshall
hired in my area.

75
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,181
What do you owners
of new taxes?

76
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,784
They accept it,
but they are not happy.

77
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,456
Shut up a minute.
Rivers, come here.

78
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,328
This is my law, Mayor.
May I propose Mr. Rivers.

79
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,866
Are you here?
- No.

80
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,102
Before 3000.
That was the deal.

81
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:58,281
Businessman. I like that.
Come to my office about ten minutes.

82
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,353
I get a drink from you,
Mr. Mayor?

83
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:10,488
Where are the men I hear
to perform?

84
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,087
You're crazy, boy.

85
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,291
Did you all crazy?
How about here?

86
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,878
They are.

87
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,315
All right.
I'm leaving.

88
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,757
I walk out of here.
- Get out.

89
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,996
Tell me, why did you let him live?

90
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,474
He's my brother.

91
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,401
Did you hear, Miss Sophie?
- What then?

92
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,026
The Glutters have gold again
found in the mountains.

93
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:30,267
How many this time?
- Not so much. It is the third time this week.

94
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:34,273
That they keep to themselves but
whether they are overrun by prospectors.

95
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,582
Can you people?

96
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:05,369
Katie, go get fast Claude.
- Yes, ma'am.

97
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,836
It's time you leave.

98
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,842
We've already told you.
We accept Scardale's proposal.

99
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,344
Things are good enough
as they are now.

100
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:47,717
Madam, this is not a peace offering.
and it is certainly not a request.

101
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,254
We're done talking.

102
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,128
What was that all about?
- Do not worry about it.

103
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,905
You know what to do.

104
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,913
Okay, guys,
time for your money.

105
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,053
This does not look good.

106
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,631
Madam, I have told you often said,

107
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,869
it is clear that you do not understand
how much danger you are.

108
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,571
You must get out or die.
 
109
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,240
Do you just not hear me?
 

109
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,750
We accept your bid.
You're not welcome here.
 

110
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,484
Madam, these guys are serious.
 

111
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:03,083
What are you doing?
Murder us all?
 

112
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,168
You come with us.

113
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,362
Afternoon, madam.
 

114
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,402
They killed everyone.
- What?
 

115
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,499
The boy tells what happens
if you're not listening.

116
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,176
You have to leave.
Now.

117
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,408
Cal help me him inside
and then to bring ...

118
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,950
Sheriff All you have to
tell what you saw here.

119
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,986
Yes, ma'am.

120
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:37,145
Quiet, boy.
Take a deep breath.

121
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,013
Why are you so excited?

122
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,451
Miss Savannah told me that
I had to tell ...

123
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,717
just a guy with her
dumped and he was severely wounded.

124
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,452
What do you mean that?

125
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,827
There came a man, kicked him
from his horse and went away.

126
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,560
Who does a guy thing on?

127
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,740
Afternoon, gentlemen.
Can I help you?

128
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:42,771
A few weeks ago, Mr. Scarsdale
you a generous proposal.

129
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:49,650
We were close and we get
for your answer.

130
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:53,657
"Gul" is not the word that
You describe this proposal.

131
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,123
Regardless, this city ...
- Is not for sale.

132
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,861
You see, we own this country.

133
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:06,968
Whose is it?
- From God.

134
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:10,303
The Almighty.

135
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,070
We have nothing but rangers.

136
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:18,381
What my friend is trying to say
Sweetwater is that we ...

137
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:22,977
Scardale's not interested in
proposal, whether good or bad.

138
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,783
I told you this would happen.

139
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,917
Hey, preacher,
you know what is the Apocalypse?

140
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:35,591
Say pastor,
You believe that God is everywhere?

141
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,896
Yeah, sure.

142
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:44,471
We tried.
He's not here when I return.

143
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:48,407
That's what comes at you, minister.
The Apocalypse.

144
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:59,854
What does it mean the Apocalypse?

145
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,927
That is, they come back.

146
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,078
What exactly is your problem?

147
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,877
My problem?

148
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,378
Your methods.

149
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,251
For God's sake.

150
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,290
First ...

151
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:37,385
everyone knows you do not
will fight with those guys.

152
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:41,262
But everyone knows
who they pay.

153
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:46,668
Stallings, I am always
been for you and McHenry.

154
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:50,299
You deserve at least, as much
and with that job as marshal.

155
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,168
That's the point.

156
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,770
You're only half the story.

157
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:01,080
Sometimes this little thing here,
the other half.

158
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:05,356
That is the answer to the equation.
Remember that.

159
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,661
You worry too much.

160
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:14,561
The resistance is limited
and it is weaker by the day.

161
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,568
By the end of the year,
it's all of us.

162
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,132
Of us?
- Yes, of us.

163
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:27,200
I always care for my employees.
You know, Stallings.

164
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:32,711
So you're the accountant, right?
- Right.

165
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:41,183
I hope you are good at your job.
- My finances are my business, Stallings.

166
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,489
You name it, partner.

167
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:57,474
Boy, tell me about the men
who have done this.

168
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,066
Wait a minute.

169
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,772
Boy, I'm a preacher.

170
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,648
Wait. It is no surprise that
neither of you has children.

171
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,482
Honey, are you?

172
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,284
You want something to eat?

173
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:16,225
A lot were just hit ...

174
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,193
murder people.

175
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:22,027
Whatever they were doing,
it did not matter.

176
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,695
They just shot them down.

177
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,774
I was the only one alive
could escape.

178
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,867
What did you just say?

179
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,583
Yes, I'm a bit hungry, ma'am.

180
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,488
We need to find out what we
here to do.

181
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,796
The first thing to do
send a telegram ...

182
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,167
and let people know that ...

183
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,405
Can I help you, miss?
- Yes, my name is Elizabeth Drayton.

184
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,478
I am looking for my father,
William Drayton.

185
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,773
There was a kind of appointment that
the government had with the Indians.

186
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:17,548
They took me away from the trunk and brought
me to an orphanage in Kansas City.

187
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:21,615
But I was happier
the Indians.

188
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:25,560
Elizabeth, you know that your father
You searched for long?

189
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:29,763
I know.
I'm not here because I'm angry.

190
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:34,862
When I found a book in Kansas City,
I knew it was about him.

191
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,635
Just all the way
The story was told.

192
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,302
So I went to all the places
which were mentioned in the book,

193
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,973
such as High Pines Farm.

194
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:47,779
But they were all deserted.

195
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:51,378
I know it's a lot to ask,

196
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,288
do you want me, please, help
my parents to find.

197
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,296
I do not know how you have to say it.

198
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,029
Your mother is deceased.

199
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,271
Please,

200
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,147
tell me that my father
is dead.

201
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:21,777
Please, I'm
half the country and traveled ...

202
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,549
After twelve years ...

203
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:29,423
Elizabeth, we're not
say that your father is dead.

204
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,624
We have your father
a long time not seen.

205
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,597
It has none.

206
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,865
He disappeared after the men
had killed your mother was murdered.

207
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,338
We will help your father
to search.

208
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:47,309
What we should do,
We will find him.

209
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,382
What has happened in Saddle Mountain?

210
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,112
I was not there.

211
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,712
You told me I should not participate
the bloodshed, remember?

212
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,984
Okay, wise guy.

213
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:05,552
What have you heard
On Saddle Mountain?

214
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:12,829
That they killed everyone.

215
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:20,375
Next time you keep only
better, because I have a witness.

216
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,002
Got it?

217
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:31,586
Why should I insinuations
and rumors?

218
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,180
I have a witness.

219
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:46,463
There will be some actions are needed
if you want to keep this issue.

220
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:51,404
I can not if the death penalty
continues to carry out for minor offenses.

221
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,910
You could.
Do you get it?

222
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,813
If you are the only people scared enough
makes them do anything you want.

223
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,283
How else do you think I
gotten the job?

224
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,944
So you're not always been.

225
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,818
I was honored when you asked me
if I wanted to be mayor,

226
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,324
but I have to handle things
as I think it's good.

227
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:11,122
You're doing great.
You're just a little too ...

228
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,595
What?

229
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,861
Fearful, Tether.
You're too afraid.

230
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,430
Yes?

231
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,671
What?
- Payton Timmons, on the train.

232
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,748
Let him.

233
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,410
Good to see you again.

234
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:36,544
Allow me to introduce you to
a good friend and the mayor here.

235
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,213
The Honourable Josiah Tether.

236
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,486
Tether, this is Payton Timmons
of the Central Pacific railroad.

237
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,327
Pleasant.

238
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:48,057
Use this table it and let
I see what you have.

239
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,866
This is called 'The Beast'.

240
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,868
Tell me about 'The Beast'.

241
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,673
She is a slope of four percent
on or off the unit ...

242
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,248
with a load of 110%.

243
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:11,319
The brake horsepower and are
unique in this world.

244
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:15,120
The boiler is double riveted
to the greater pressure to be.

245
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:18,992
This is the key to our
plans into reality.

246
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:22,396
We are already ten years
to a locomotive ...

247
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,266
and this is the best we
ever had.

248
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,268
Yes?
- I must speak Scarsdale.

249
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,864
He's busy.

250
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,374
I.

251
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,138
Gentlemen, this is the gateway to California ...

252
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,845
and it is here for your eyes.

253
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:49,582
Chancellor who wants to see you.

254
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:54,331
Gentlemen, do yourself at home. I must
briefly to talk with these gentlemen.

255
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:59,296
What is it?
- Saddle Mountain is destroyed.

256
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,032
Good.
I knew I could count on you.

257
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,467
Money talks.
- Now we're on the subject ...

258
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,138
Yes, yes.
 

259
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:14,683
I expect the delivery
the locomotive of one week.
 

260
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:20,156
I guess that is enough time
to convince people of Sweetwater?
 

261
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,693
This will be the same
and Saddle Mountain.

262
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,130
Payment in advance ...

263
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,667
and afterwards.

264
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,531
Whatever it takes.

265
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:41,476
This sounds like a great train.
- Is it well.

266
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,774
But this is no ordinary machine.

267
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,443
We estimate that in two weeks
can drive from coast to coast.

268
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:53,389
What can we achieve?
- Everything you want.

269
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,793
I get the feeling that Scarsdale
our underpaid.

270
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,599
I hope not.
For his good.

271
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:11,141
I do not know.
He gave me $ 500.

272
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:15,036
I know what you think.
He spend money just like that,

273
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:19,014
but he knows that he finally
five times as much deserves.

274
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:55,752
I've known these ladies for a long time.
They can perhaps help us.

275
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:11,492
You look lost out.

276
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:15,369
Madam, I am Thomas Kincaid,
the Sheriff of Sweetwater.

277
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:19,773
We look for a friend of ours
who may live in the mountains.

278
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,545
Friend who has a name?
- Yes, ma'am, William Drayton.

279
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:28,719
Does not sound familiar. You know him?
- No.

280
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,920
It is said that he is good
with a gun.

281
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:35,757
Actually, very good with a gun.
- Living high in the mountains.

282
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,452
He's a great shooter.

283
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,622
It is known that he appears
when people are in trouble.

284
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,666
Hopefully they do not intend
to scroll to ride.

285
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:48,632
You can leave those horses are better, unless
They trained for a mountain to climb.

286
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,230
I take care of them.

287
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,736
Then we have to walk.

288
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:58,872
Madam, this should be enough
for the horses to care.

289
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:17,633
Travis, wait. Are you sure
you know where you're going?

290
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:23,329
Come on, Sheriff. I have 2400 km
traveled. We are close.

291
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,147
So's the spirit.

292
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,513
Something is wrong.
- Come on, Travis.

293
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:39,180
Listen.
I hear something.

294
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,772
My friends that would
not really appreciate.

295
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,641
Guys.

296
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,455
I am pastor.
I'm unarmed.

297
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,164
Go ahead, law minister.

298
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:27,931
Put the gun from its holster.
Give it here.

299
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:33,067
We follow you for a while.
Trying to get close enough.

300
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:40,511
And be sure. This is a very
beautiful girl who accompanies you.

301
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,823
What do you want?

302
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:50,189
I think that you two
no longer need

303
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,262
but we take her along.

304
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,663
You stay, at least, life.

305
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,063
That's him.

306
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,467
What the hell are you doing here?

307
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,170
We are looking for you.

308
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:52,182
Daddy?

309
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,425
I love you, Lizzie.

310
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:41,267
Why did you two years
ago so suddenly?

311
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,971
I had gone, Tom.
Bad memories.

312
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,676
Where have you gone?

313
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,987
I lived a while in the mountains.

314
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:08,526
Lived in a while
the Blackfoot tribe.

315
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:12,160
I tried to find a place
where the past I could not find.

316
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,864
The past remains with us, Will.

317
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:20,409
I know.
So I came home.

318
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,510
Why did you find us
when you came back?

319
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:44,061
The unexpected gift
who gives us life.

320
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:53,910
I've never been so happy
I saw someone else.

321
00:36:57,015 --> 00:37:00,842
Will, Scarsdale has the whole
area were taken.

322
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,589
This is no surprise.
He could always smell the money already.

323
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,421
Will, he does not
in a good way.

324
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,985
He takes over the villages.
Lift heavy loads ...

325
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:16,565
and kills those who
There will not want to settle.

326
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:22,804
He is not the type of a murderer.
- He's not the one who kills.

327
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,399
He has an army together
he called "The Company Men 'calls.

328
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,341
They kill for him.

329
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:32,849
Not long ago,
they went to Saddle Mountain.

330
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,351
They killed everyone,
except one boy.

331
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:42,921
Daddy, I want to stay with you
and handle this.

332
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:47,928
Of course you stay with me ...

333
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:51,729
but I said nothing
on this deal.

334
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,805
Will you not help?
You need help.

335
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,964
You're William Drayton.

336
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,244
Those days are over.

337
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:07,749
I just want a normal
life.

338
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,924
Tell me, please ...

339
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:26,197
you're not my daughter
brought to you here ...

340
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,673
so that I can engage in here
and her life is threatened.

341
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,744
No, they ...
- No, I have visited them.

342
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,871
Because I had found.

343
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,479
Where did you get that?

344
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,291
I found it, I ...

345
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,662
It gave me new hope and ...

346
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:59,567
I knew I'd find you
After I had found.

347
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,769
Your mother ...

348
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,397
she made me promise
we just ...

349
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:08,409
would remember the times
we had with you.

350
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:13,481
I could not keep that promise.

351
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:25,160
I had to keep looking.

352
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:31,493
I made up stories about
stray calves.

353
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,769
I was sometimes days.

354
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,474
And when I came back told
I had something about wolves.

355
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,776
God rest her soul.

356
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,852
We did not even calves.

357
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,089
I knew in my heart ...

358
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,195
you were there somewhere.

359
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,495
I learned a lot
while I was away.

360
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:08,402
And I still do everything
Mom taught me and what you have.

361
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:13,534
And I know that the reason
Why I am still alive ...

362
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,612
and why I'm here.

363
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:22,075
And that's why we have these people
should help. You know that.

364
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,959
What should we do?

365
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:43,339
I want moms grave.
 
367
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,443
We do.
 

366
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,777
We do.

367
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,586
If you came to arrest me,
Now you had already shot.

368
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:38,958
I think that I was hoping you
you and your brother had forgotten.

369
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:43,829
I have no hope.
For a long time anymore.

370
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:47,131
I was hoping you
busy.

371
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:50,765
I hear that you are the
who is busy.

372
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,399
How's your brother?

373
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,741
He's dead.
Shot in cold blood.

374
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:01,142
Why I doubt now?

375
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:04,220
Who makes me happy?

376
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:07,422
A man named William Drayton.

377
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,016
Is that so?

378
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,563
As you may have one bitter
feeling left over.

379
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:20,602
Marshall, you start to irritate me.
I have things to do.

380
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:30,136
Your face is on wanted posters
from here to San Fancisco.

381
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:34,775
Whatever you do come here,
that can not erase.

382
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:41,758
I think not.
Good day, marshal.

383
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,069
Have you found who you're looking for?

384
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:02,168
Yes, this is the father of Elizabeth,
William Drayton.

385
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,713
Pleasant, madam.
You may call me Will.

386
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,615
I have a couple of rooms as
what you want to refresh.

387
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,153
Then we finished eating.

388
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:17,484
And this is my newest occupant,
Hunter.

389
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,826
Daddy, I'm going to wash, okay?

390
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,128
That's what I do.

391
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:26,293
That sounds good.

392
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:31,204
Will Hunter is the only
survivor of Saddle Mountain.

393
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,073
You're a brave boy.

394
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:38,913
We'll see you later at dinner.

395
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,683
Thank you.

396
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:57,095
Excuse me,
I have some towels for you.

397
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,795
Does not matter.
Thank you.

398
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,701
And thanks for the room.
I can pay for it.

399
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,967
Need not, Mr. Drayton.
 

400
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:11,236
My name is Will.
 

401
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:28,964
I must warn you. He is strong.
Even this morning.

402
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,897
Be warned.

403
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,708
Sorry, he's really strong. I know.
- No, it's nice.

404
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:48,443
I put a new pot.
- No, it's a good thing.

405
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:56,656
Justin, what did I tell you
about that gun?

406
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,991
Go feed the animals
before dark. Now.

407
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:02,257
I'm sorry.

408
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,170
Would you murder me sometimes, woman?

409
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,385
Excuse me, sir.
- Hey, banker guest.

410
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:39,027
I'm late for a meeting, sir.
- You owe me a fight.

411
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,694
What did you say?

412
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:46,333
Two years ago, probably me
in two shot with a shotgun.

413
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:49,071
It's time for revenge.

414
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:53,115
I am not what you'd call
a gunfighter. I'm unarmed.

415
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:57,948
I challenge you to a duel.

416
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:02,323
How it works.
We are back to back,

417
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:07,159
We put every ten steps,
turn around and shoot.

418
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,596
Go.
 

419
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:14,103
One, two, three, four ...
 

420
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:19,767
five, six, seven, eight, nine ...
 

421
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:26,607
You're lucky but, banker,
that we are on the same side.
 

422
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,615
Remember,

423
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,917
I can, at any time, shoot.

424
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,297
Come inside.

425
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,202
Honey, that you can discard.

426
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,704
I'm here
and I'm not going anywhere.

427
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,436
I know.
I was reading about Mom.

428
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,705
We go to her house.
- I'm ready.

429
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,318
I do not know ...

430
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:45,725
It's okay, Daddy.

431
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,797
You have nothing to say.

432
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:53,633
I wish Travis was here. He was
always been better at this sort of thing.

433
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:41,012
In this regard, we have
been more than patient.

434
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:45,077
Tom, what's the problem?

435
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:48,851
Check it out.
William Drayton if this is not.

436
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:52,122
Did I not tell you
had to find another job?

437
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:54,821
That's what I did.

438
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,166
Same train, different track.

439
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:04,472
Apparently we have a reunion.
- Yes, it is long ago.

440
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,509
We know you?

441
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:11,843
I remember seeing a couple of years
ago, you have helped you in battle.

442
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,315
Maybe that was wrong.

443
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:21,583
Your memory is better than mine,
but I drink a lot.

444
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:25,423
In any case, you have these people
tell them to leave.

445
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:28,861
They have no idea
what's coming.

446
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,236
Tom, what do you do?

447
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:40,104
I think we should do what
good for these people ...

448
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,441
and admit
these bastards.

449
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,445
You pulled rather slowly.
- Did I?

450
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,142
That was your last chance.

451
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:56,459
I remember you were pretty quickly
with that weapon.

452
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:01,190
Is also delayed by the drink?
- There you'll find only one way back.

453
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:26,148
The men are back in Scarsdale.

454
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,889
You have to collect the children.

455
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,825
I must go to Tom.

456
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,092
Why do you use the shotgun?

457
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,658
You have one shot and what do you
do next? Throw it to him?

458
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:44,138
I can shoot with two
a shot. What can I do with that?

459
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,402
Six, one for each bullet.

460
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,173
I try to keep you alive.
I have no use for a dead deputy.

461
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:08,755
Tom, I know I do this
not to say.

462
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:13,859
But collect as many weapons
and ammo if you can find.

463
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:17,336
Remove the people from the street.

464
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,844
You take this side,
I the other.

465
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,343
And Tom ...

466
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:31,852
let me begin.

467
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:14,993
Do not use them unless
you can not otherwise.

468
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:17,566
How do I know when this happens?
- That you know.

469
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:22,400
Until you firing the first shot,
they will not know you're here.

470
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,443
Remember what I taught you?
- Yes.

471
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:40,420
Whatever happens,

472
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:45,157
do not let them come out.

473
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:40,811
Apparently they become smart.

474
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,187
Where do you think you're going?

475
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,357
They're going to need me.

476
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,022
They are all of us need.

477
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,689
No, Mr. Drayton gave you those weapons
to defend the fort.

478
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,858
This is the fort.
You stay here.

479
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:42,561
How is it that when I
you work together, I is full of holes?

480
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:50,038
I go to the cabin.

481
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:54,171
I need to see how
with Elizabeth.

482
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,300
Are you sure it
William Drayton was?

483
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,195
Most definitely.

484
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:45,233
The same William Drayton
two, three years ago?

485
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,803
That's what they say.

486
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,542
We regroup
and still fall once.

487
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:56,635
The train the day after.

488
00:56:56,746 --> 00:57:00,512
All they did was some time
and bought a lot of problems.

489
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:03,347
Okay, listen all.

490
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:05,751
I have $ 3,000 cash ...

491
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:08,756
for those I Will Drayton's
shooting finger brings.

492
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:17,393
$ 3,000.

493
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:23,270
I want you to tell me everything
what you know about that William Drayton.

494
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,898
Drayton is mine.

495
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:29,637
I give you the finger or
when I'm done.

496
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:37,318
I received a message
you wanted to see me. Is that correct?

497
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,321
I want to make clear, Marshall.

498
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:43,881
I reject the methods of Mr. Scarsdale
not good.

499
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,154
Is that so?

500
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,456
Yes, it is.

501
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,999
I've heard that Will Drayton
is back.

502
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,466
That's right.

503
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,403
I've also heard that he was not
on your side.

504
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,277
That's right.

505
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:04,471
There like you do not really
concerned about.

506
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:08,750
Will Drayton is a man.
We collect an army.

507
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,790
Tether, You have too much confidence ...

508
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:18,793
that suggest that peasants
You've put together for.

509
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,725
Gentlemen, your drinks.
 
512
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:25,956
Thank you.
 

510
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:34,043
Why do not you step on your horse
and do not you get out of this town?

511
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,238
That train is coming.
 

512
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:42,877
I want to finish.
That is honorable.

513
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:45,454
Something honorable ...
 
517
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:48,524
You do not for a long time.

514
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:55,996
Kyle, how are
my deputy?

515
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,161
He was twice in the chest
hit, sheriff.

516
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,000
He's dead.

517
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,703
Never thought that the West
still wild.

518
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,040
This is a war ...

519
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,643
to decent,
hardworking people ...

520
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:19,414
by Horace Scarsdale.

521
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:28,856
A few years ago I had
the feeling that I would see him.

522
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,064
I'm just glad your mom
not here to see this.

523
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:42,839
I'm afraid we men
will still look back.

524
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:46,143
I know.
They come back.

525
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,717
And more.

526
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:52,753
Then we can not stop.
- What will we do?

527
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,714
We fight.

528
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:01,121
We do more than that.

529
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:05,229
We attack.
- Attacks? With what?

530
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:10,370
With everything we have.
That's the last thing they expect.

531
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:15,106
You have no ammo
for the gun?

532
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:19,045
Yes, and I'm almost through
my .45 back.

533
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:23,916
Will, I do not much ammunition.
- No problem.

534
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,049
I can use Vetterli,
I suppose.

535
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:31,388
It uses a weird caliber
and it takes one day to make to come.

536
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:36,022
.41? I think I still
two boxes from me.

537
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:40,728
That's about 100 bullets.
It's worth the trip.

538
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:48,236
Most men of Scarsdale
are farmers.

539
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:52,376
Not many of them have
slain for their livelihood.

540
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:57,146
Wade and that arrogant Chancellor ...

541
01:00:57,253 --> 01:01:01,280
do not follow them.

542
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,551
Leave them to me.

543
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,954
Five or six years ago ...

544
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:11,659
I helped some miners buried
who had died looking for gold.

545
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:16,634
The dynamite they used,
is still in the mine.

546
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,264
About 50 to 60 each.

547
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:22,071
Quite old.
Dangerous.

548
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:26,137
So, less than 100 bullets ...

549
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:31,687
Maybe 50 bars of what is now
Pure nitroglycerin is probably ...

550
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:34,086
And fear.

551
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:40,459
Scarsdale's men will not now
so much more to William Drayton record.

552
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:44,490
I doubt it.

553
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:48,434
May I ask why you're so happy?

554
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,665
Flowers.

555
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:53,264
We have many flowers are needed.

556
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,469
That was charming, darling.

557
01:01:57,013 --> 01:02:02,883
Think you a bouquet of flowers
can hit from about 150 meters far?

558
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,820
Yes.
- Good.

559
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:19,567
Travis, as usual
Today you do not fight it.

560
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:24,336
Thou shalt not ...
- I know the story.

561
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:30,003
You have for me
go to Paradise Junction.

562
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:32,740
On exploration.

563
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:38,348
Pay attention to
how the village was built.

564
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,084
I can do.

565
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:46,651
Lizzie and I go back
to the log cabin ...

566
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,993
and get the Vetterli.

567
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,726
We come here tomorrow afternoon
back together.

568
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:03,268
Good morning, gentlemen.

569
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,404
How are you today?

570
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,018
The parish has sent me.

571
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,679
I had to see how
The construction of the church.

572
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:16,287
Become our new pastor?
- Maybe.

573
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:19,821
How long before it is ready?
- Maybe two weeks.

574
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:26,562
The Lord would give people
in the first place to come.

575
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:31,573
Is that Mr. Scarsdale?
- Yes.

576
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:35,706
Another good day, gentlemen.

577
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:08,737
An eagle's nest.

578
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:16,282
Do you feel good about
those men who have hired you?

579
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:19,013
Yes. Is there a problem?

580
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:23,320
What is your goal?
- I do not follow.

581
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:24,484
I am mercenary.

582
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:28,155
I have worked for men
who were worse off than you.

583
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:30,425
But I do not get you informed.

584
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:35,300
The people I used to
've worked for, had a motive.

585
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:40,307
But you, however ...
From you I get no height.

586
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:44,741
Is that a problem?
- Not at all.

587
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:48,838
I'll see how it
the recruitment goes.

588
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:52,250
Miss Savannah?

589
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:56,115
There's someone here for you
- Who?

590
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,193
The law.

591
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,182
So you stay here, huh?

592
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:23,616
I have not come within hearing,
marshall.

593
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:30,591
It's a long, long ago,
Savannah.

594
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,957
That was another life.

595
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:36,859
Yeah, I think so.
Where is Drayton?

596
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:39,365
He's not there.

597
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:44,904
Are you working for Scarsdale,
like the rest?

598
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:49,711
I try to keep quiet.
Keep the peace.

599
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,642
That's what I do.

600
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:57,878
I make peace.

601
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:00,956
His father gave me this piece of tin.

602
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:08,562
It's good to see you.

603
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:26,747
Are there good at that?

604
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:29,215
I did not like
me sneaks so.

605
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:34,117
This is Parker. Who was with us
during the attack on Saddle Mountain.

606
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:37,485
Nice.
- That we should keep.

607
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:40,892
Any of these idiots
can shoot a shotgun.

608
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,794
Remember that.

609
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:45,662
Find out who he is loyal.

610
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:56,301
Will, there's a front man
who is looking for you.

611
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,819
It's not good.

612
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,399
What the hell do you want?

613
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:33,107
Scarsdale gives $ 3,000 to the man
finger brings you shoot back.

614
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:40,413
That will not work.

615
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:44,050
I know that you assume
the best marksman in his ...

616
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:50,258
but how good are you when you
face to face with another?

617
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:06,803
If Scarsdale want to fight,

618
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,749
You can go back and tell him ...

619
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,649
I will come.

620
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:14,879
There will be more to come.

621
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,825
More.

622
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:25,359
Take it a better offer
on that horse.

623
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:29,366
$ 50.
- Is that your best offer?

624
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:32,066
I'm out.
I have nothing.

625
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:35,270
And you?
- Three Kings.

626
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:42,316
If I were you, I might mention
near the redhead continued.

627
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:44,750
Who has herpes.

628
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,482
Really?
- Nice.

629
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,525
Do you speak from experience?
- Yes.

630
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:53,891
So, you're worried
of Scarsdale, huh?

631
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,624
Indeed.

632
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:02,704
It's not good.
- Come on. He pays us.

633
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:06,036
That is much better than
all my previous jobs.

634
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,770
He's right.
He pays us.

635
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:12,837
We have become involved
to what we can.

636
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:19,416
I do not know. Maybe it's
Now you will not moment.

637
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:21,422
Say it.
 
642
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:28,163
What's bothering you?
 

638
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:33,624
The man has a fortune.
 

639
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:36,364
Forget those farmers that we
have recruited.

640
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:42,575
Perhaps it is time
we pay our own collection.

641
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,644
Yes.

642
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,150
Yeah, I got you through.

643
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:52,152
If I did not know better ...

644
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:56,213
I would think you
about the mutiny have.

645
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:01,528
I'll get another bottle.

646
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:05,025
Scarsdale is a bit behind us.

647
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,568
I am not here to kill.

648
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:12,799
I have previously done.
Me it's the money.

649
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:19,247
Horace Scarsdale is smart.

650
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:22,317
He must have foreseen
that we were going to do.

651
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:25,683
You would not say otherwise.

652
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:30,282
A man like Scarsdale
is dangerous.

653
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:41,295
It's a beautiful night.

654
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,664
Right.

655
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:57,715
I heard your man
cavalryman was.

656
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,378
That's right.

657
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:03,788
He died a few years ago.
During the Indian wars.

658
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:09,289
We have purchased
just before he left.

659
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:12,263
He had found it for us.

660
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:18,562
When he'd be back,
we would operate together.

661
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:24,804
When he'd be back,
 

662
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:28,314
and so we found a family.
 

663
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:33,722
But he never came back.
 

664
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:43,357
Will Drayton, I remember you
not so long but ...

665
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:46,366
Do something for me, please.

666
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:54,465
Of course.
- Come back tomorrow, really.

667
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:56,544
You and Elizabeth.

668
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:10,921
Justin, I just thought that I
You have given no birthday present.

669
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,455
Please.
Let not your mother.

670
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:20,501
Wait, do you have someone
kill them?

671
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:23,833
No, it's pure.

672
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,916
Will he talk to you?

673
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:43,754
No, not really.

674
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:49,798
I better go.

675
01:12:56,438 --> 01:13:00,135
Thanks for the food.
It was fun.

676
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,470
I also found.

677
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:04,879
I see you again soon?

678
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:08,377
Sure.

679
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,652
The gun is in the closet.

680
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,862
It had a visor on.

681
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:28,334
This I leave High Pines.

682
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:31,167
It has not helped much.

683
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:33,503
It is heavy.

684
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:13,739
See you on the back
of the church. Forwards.

685
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:20,050
Goddamn, why did
No one woke me up?

686
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,823
Tom, what did you do? You can
hardly move, let alone shoot.

687
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:30,064
It is also my fight.
Will is not alone.

688
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:32,963
He said you had to stay
in case these men back.

689
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:36,662
He said it just me
keep out of trouble.

690
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:40,869
Travis, you said last night no ...

691
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,308
you saw
they recruit more men?

692
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:45,141
Yes.

693
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:48,239
Go to my office
and get some guns and ammunition.

694
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,751
Yes, sir, but we're with you.
- Now.

695
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:58,853
Tom, what are you doing?
- We go to Paradise Junction.

696
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:02,556
Sheriff, there is already a child
involved in this mess.

697
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:07,397
I know and I'll do anything
what I can to protect her.

698
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:46,436
This is a good place.
It is out of the way.

699
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:50,478
As Travis said,
these people do not care ...

700
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:53,070
the construction of the church.

701
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:58,710
Well, I'm going to Scarsdale
proposals.

702
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:03,882
Do you have the gun?

703
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:09,762
So I know my girl.
Okay, come right back to here.

704
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,196
I will.

705
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:17,161
Ms?
- Yes?

706
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:20,139
I want to speak with Mr. Scarsdale,
Please.

707
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:23,211
He's busy.
He comes back immediately.

708
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:33,352
You are about that reality
to see where I told you about.

709
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:35,355
Nothing can stop us, Tether.

710
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:37,516
The engineers hooks all wagons
down there ...

711
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:40,060
and bring the locomotive
come here for the party.

712
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:43,460
That sounds great,
Mr. Scarsdale.

713
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,261
A young lady wants to see you.

714
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:49,132
Mr. Scarsdale,
My father works for you

715
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:50,898
Hello, Miss.

716
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:55,464
I have a great idea how
The village can brighten up for the party.

717
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:57,903
What might that be?

718
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:01,813
I would like to have the buildings in
a bouquet of flowers up the main street.

719
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,975
Excuse me?

720
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:08,650
Flowers.
I picked them myself.

721
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:11,055
How much will it cost me?
- Nothing at all.

722
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:15,986
It has cost me nothing.
And do not worry. I do everything myself.

723
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:18,830
Okay, good.
Thank you.

724
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,959
How old are you, miss?

725
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:25,332
21.
- 21, huh?

726
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,533
A young lady with your assets ...

727
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,874
a great money
In one of my saloon.

728
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:36,408
When you feel good opdirkt,
who knows.

729
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:40,180
Then I might
myself to see you.

730
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,324
Quite a charmer, is not it?

731
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:52,161
Yeah, sorry that he
the wrong side.

732
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:55,895
Otherwise we had such good friends
can be.

733
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:58,931
Justin, come on.

734
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:01,737
I got some chores
in the village to do.

735
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:04,778
Come on.

736
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,314
A little faster.
Come on.

737
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:11,483
Have you had enough of
to cover all the dynamite?

738
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:14,417
You should be.

739
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:21,761
Most importantly,
The dynamite is secure.

740
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,831
If it is not ...

741
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:26,730
then slide it along
down the pole ...

742
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:30,327
and this party started
for all the guests arrive.

743
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:33,930
No problem, I can.

744
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,466
They are beautiful.

745
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:22,919
Okay, there are about eleven.

746
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:34,427
Daddy?
What should I do?

747
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:36,833
Leave.

748
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:40,099
But I can help.

749
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:46,169
You've already helped.

750
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:51,182
Go back to Sweetwater.

751
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:55,886
Savannah say that they have a great time
ready. I will be going hungry.

752
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:04,828
I love you.
- Take care.

753
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,662
Forwards.

754
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:02,939
Chancellot, come on.
It's Drayton.

755
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:10,891
Gentlemen ...

756
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:14,325
I give you this one chance ...

757
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:17,727
to leave the city.

758
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:28,771
I expected that answer.

759
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,252
No.
 

760
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:30,902
Come on, damn it.
 

761
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:36,948
Transferred.
 

762
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:41,384
Listen ...
 
768
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:46,066
Scarsdale is not killed.

763
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:50,030
I know you want it.

764
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:52,971
I know he deserves.

765
01:26:53,074 --> 01:26:54,974
But if you kill him,

766
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:57,101
I can not help you.

767
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:00,780
Do you understand?

768
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:06,420
Still enjoy the rest
of your afternoon.

769
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:25,805
Not a good move.

770
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:36,316
William, what are you doing?

771
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:39,648
Do you think your problems are over
if you kill me?

772
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,051
Hear that?

773
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:48,785
That's the sound progress, Drayton.
The future.

774
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:52,332
Men like you
have settled.

775
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:54,560
No longer needed.

776
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:10,208
I can murder you,
but not.

777
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:30,623
Shelter from the company men
15 km from Paradise Junction

778
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:55,588
Have you seen Rivers?
- No, not lately.

779
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:58,817
I have heard that he
been shot.

780
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:02,722
And Wade?

781
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:08,132
No, but I think he took off
with that woman whom he associated.

782
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:11,205
Gentlemen, come here.

783
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,162
I thought you guys wanted to know.

784
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:40,462
I just sent a telegram
to the U.S. marshal office in Sacramento.

785
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:42,763
I will be there on
a few days ...

786
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:46,169
signing warrants
for William Drayton,

787
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:50,074
and the young lady
who helped him.

788
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:52,579
That was no lady.
 
795
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,843
That's the legal side.
 

789
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:58,578
On the other side of the equation ...
 

790
01:30:58,686 --> 01:31:02,816
I increase my reward
Drayton to $ 25,000.

791
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:05,256
$ 25,000?

792
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:08,157
I've never heard of such a
high rewards heard.

793
01:31:09,764 --> 01:31:12,824
We take Drayton. Maybe
We still need 100 more men,

794
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:14,492
but he will be stopped.

795
01:31:15,036 --> 01:31:17,197
You drive us all killed.

796
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:20,138
If you are not silent,
I make it yourself.

797
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:23,473
The reward ...

798
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:25,773
Dead or alive?

799
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,678
Why would I want him in hell
want to live?

800
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:37,985
Keep your money.
I grab Drayton.

801
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:09,379
You are here for hours.

802
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:14,795
Someone is injured.
They are too long.

803
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:21,263
I had another dream last night.

804
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:24,964
Oh, Lord.
Tell me.

805
01:32:25,072 --> 01:32:28,405
It's ...
I do not want ...

806
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:35,747
All right.
What did you dream?

807
01:32:37,018 --> 01:32:40,920
I dreamed I wandered around.
Aimlessly.

808
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:45,725
I had no home.
Walked from place to place.

809
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:51,493
And all around me were like.

810
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:58,971
Then, on the hill.
On the back,

811
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:01,837
I saw the man above
was responsible.

812
01:33:03,778 --> 01:33:07,681
No.
It was William Drayton.

813
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:27,634
Where are Tom and the boys?

814
01:33:28,669 --> 01:33:31,103
These provide for the horses.

815
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:34,468
You came back.

816
