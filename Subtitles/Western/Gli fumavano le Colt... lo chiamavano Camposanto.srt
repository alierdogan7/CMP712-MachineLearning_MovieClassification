1
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,914
THEY CALL HIM CEMETERY

2
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,632
He's coming, Mister.
He's at the north pass!

3
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,796
One more hour.

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,869
For 15 years. For 15 years
I've been waiting for this day!

5
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,397
- Pedro! Chico!
- Yes, Mister?

6
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,392
How long will it take you
to saddle the horses, damn it?

7
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,755
Well, quite long, Mister.

8
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,154
You're supposed to arrive
at the village before the coach does.

9
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,515
I want my boys to get
some fresh horses.

10
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,068
These are no horses, Mister,
these are devils!

11
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,912
They have to feel
the whip first!

12
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,673
My boys will tame
your devils!

13
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,399
With one hand they'll
show them who's the boss.

14
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,233
- Hey, stay here!
- Go!

15
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,228
Come on!
Let's go, boy!

16
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,076
How will we
recognize them, Mister?

17
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,197
That'll be very easy,
you can't miss them.

18
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,874
They are two strong, young lads
with shoulders that big.

19
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,636
Blue eyes and arms that
could break your horses' neck.

20
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,110
They are two oaks,
two strong Irish oaks!

21
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,556
You know what, George?
I found the virtue...

22
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,394
...of this tobacco:
It eases that horrible stench.

23
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,710
- Do you want some?
- No, thank you.

24
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,589
Oh, beg my pardon, reverend,
I should have offered you some first!

25
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,069
- Would you like some tobacco?
- No, thanks.

26
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,559
May I?

27
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,874
- Please, Madam.
- Thanks.

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,470
I'm not a reverend, even though
we work in the same department:

29
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,676
Them the souls,
me the corpses.

30
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,432
I'm a gravedigger and
I'm going to Arlington...

31
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,080
...to take over my friend
Samuelson's business...

32
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,958
...who's retiring to enjoy
the fruits of his work.

33
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,598
You'll get rich
in two years!

34
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,513
Ah, Arlington you said!
Has there been an epidemic?

35
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,478
Yes! And there still is!
And hopefully it will stay for a while!

36
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,599
- Good grace! What is it?
- Chronical... plumbism!

37
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,996
Now, now, don't cry!

38
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,353
Look... what your
mama's got for you!

39
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,716
That's good, good!

40
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,398
John, take a look around!

41
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,038
They're bristled
with weapons!

42
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,872
Withal, the war's been over
for quite a while now.

43
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,475
But you, my dear little sons,
don't you carry any weapons?

44
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,393
- Absolutely not, Madam!
- Maybe we're the only ones.

45
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,436
- Except for you.
- Oh yes.

46
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,798
But I just don't trust
these modern weapons.

47
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,392
This one belonged to my husband.
He shall rest in peace.

48
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,430
Sure, back then
I was a better shot.

49
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,794
But nowadays,
you know...

50
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,668
...the eyes are a little worse,
the hand shakes a bit.

51
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,113
Will you stop that?

52
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,679
Can't you once keep
your fingers off your guns...

53
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,113
...until we arrived
at the station?

54
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,997
- Are we there yet, boss?
- Almost.

55
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,389
10 minutes until we
change the horses.

56
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,598
Quick stop in Arlington -
that's more healthy for everybody!

57
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,714
Arlington! The lucky ones who
journey on may go for a short walk.

58
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,749
- Look! That must be the two!
- Virgin mother, gigantic oaks.

59
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,400
- Quick, let's go!
- Yes, yes.

60
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,792
Welcome, gentlemen!
I'm Pedro and that's my brother Chico.

61
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,758
We're the employees
of Mr. McIntire.

62
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,718
And who gives a damn?
Get out of the way.

63
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,679
That's not really...

64
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,239
...what I expected, but...
- Hey!

65
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,710
If you don't like
the view, get lost.

66
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,435
Let go! I want to teach him
some manners, these peasants!

67
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,796
That would take too long, George.
I'll take care of that.

68
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,479
- Well? A nice animal, isn't it?
- Well, a nice animal, but too expensive!

69
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,755
- What?
- Good manners are not your strength.

70
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,432
But there's still
some time to learn.

71
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,636
- You think so?
- Yes, I mean you.

72
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,551
There are two ways of teaching
good manners to someone.

73
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,757
But for you, I obviously
have to use the quicker one.

74
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,310
- So?
- So what? Listen, silly billy.

75
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,630
I don't know how you take care
of things where you come from...

76
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,598
...but over here, we do it with this.
- Come on, let him go.

77
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,716
Can't you see
they're two unarmed kids?

78
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,519
Well, but they are some bigmouths.
Give him your gun.

79
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,999
I'll just give him
a tiny scratch.

80
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,718
No, no!
Just a second.

81
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,430
A gentleman can't fight
with a savage.

82
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,717
- We're from Boston.
- Who cares?

83
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,640
Hey, nag!
Get out of the way!

84
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,229
Hey you!

85
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,912
I told you to get lost!

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,878
And yet another master
of good manners.

87
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,355
Are you deaf?
Turn around!

88
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,917
Turn around,
you bastard!

89
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,236
No, my friend.

90
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,073
You don't think you'll
get away with that, do you?

91
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,033
Come on, don't make me beg you!
You're no mama's son.

92
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,156
And you have
a gun, too.

93
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,393
Are you mute?

94
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,948
Let me hear some
or I'll deflate your ass!

95
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,108
Mister?

96
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,956
I'm asking you
to listen to me.

97
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,310
My name is
John McIntire.

98
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,758
Pedro!
They are the oaks.

99
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,673
I have to remark that your
behavior wasn't very polite.

100
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,150
The total opposite, I have to say
that we did not agree with it at all.

101
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,911
Your interference was...
Hey Mister!

102
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,633
Welcome, Masters!

103
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,075
I'm Pedro and this
is my brother Chico.

104
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,674
We're the employees
of your father, Mr. Rhett.

105
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,479
We came to accompany
you to the ranch.

106
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,314
Okay. You can get the bags and
the suitcases, they're on the coach.

107
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,436
- Chico! The luggage!
- Alright.

108
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,956
Just a minute, we have a
surprise for you, Masters!

109
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,118
What kind of place
is this anyway?

110
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,796
These, Masters, are wonderful
full-breds, full of fire.

111
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,279
- Take a look!
- Yes, very nice, Chico...

112
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,998
...but maybe another time.
- But they're for you!

113
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,038
- Your father is sending you them.
- I understand, Chico. Thank you.

114
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,759
- I'm Pedro.
- Alright, Pedro.

115
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,273
Surrender!

116
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,030
Hey come on,
now it's my turn!

117
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,597
- But... that's a proper mania!
- Certainly seems so.

118
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,558
John! I surely hope you're not planning,
to present yourself to our father like that.

119
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,596
- In this condition!
- That would be inexcusable...

120
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,671
- Ah, Pedro!
- But I'm Chico, Master.

121
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,274
- Yes, sure, Chico. We're going to the hotel.
- To the hotel, Master?

122
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,715
- A harborage. Do you know what that is?
- But your father is awaiting...

123
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,360
- To the hotel, Pedro.
- But I'm Chico!

124
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,432
To the hotel, Chico.
You two, wait for us.

125
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,151
They're no oaks, Chico,
they're two blockheads!

126
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,232
And don't you ever shove
your dirty mugs in here again!

127
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,633
Get up, you boozer!
I'm with you in a minute.

128
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,760
And don't you ever show up
here again, understood?

129
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,071
I have the impression that someone
at this table cheats mighty big.

130
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,479
I won't name
any names.

131
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,788
But I swear,
if I catch him cheating...

132
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,110
...I'll also shoot
his good eye away!

133
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,998
- What are you trying to say by that?
- I'll tell you when I caught you.

134
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,595
Hey, hey, let's rather gamble instead.
Deal the cards, buddy.

135
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,592
- Something to drink?
- Beer, my friend, beer.

136
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,556
Here's the first one!

137
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,955
But this time you won't get away
with that little game of yours!

138
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,873
You asked these two bastards
for help! Didn't you?

139
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,430
Come on, boys, stop it,
be good! Be good!

140
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,310
Quit it, stop...

141
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,949
Hey! What the hell?
You're destroying all my stuff!

142
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,873
Damn it!
My beautiful hotel!

143
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,677
- It's enough, I said!
- My goodness!

144
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,315
They don't exactly
follow the boxing rules...

145
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,834
...but these friendly peasants
do have a big temper.

146
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,070
- No, really.
- Look, look at him.

147
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,077
You madmen!
Just go away!

148
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,556
And you!
Come here...

149
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,674
One moment!
Help!

150
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,671
Young gentlemen!
I think we better leave.

151
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,512
Your father is expecting you
and they are starting a brawl!

152
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,636
You're right, Pedro.
I also think our father...

153
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,518
...would not agree with
our presence here at all.

154
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,195
- Daddy!
- Boys, no sentimentalities, alright?

155
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,436
Ah, boys, what a joy.
Finally you're home.

156
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,114
Hey, no
sentimentalities, Dad!

157
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,634
- Your words, you remember?
- Yes, you're right.

158
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,712
How lucky she
would be right now.

159
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,395
- Do you still remember her, John?
- Only very vague, Dad.

160
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,436
You can't remember
her, George.

161
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,159
She left us before
you learned to walk.

162
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,630
Her only wish was to see you
growing up in a different place.

163
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,918
And I fulfilled her wish.
It's been hard, I missed you a lot.

164
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,318
But she was right,
it was better that way.

165
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,391
Chico,
the flowers please.

166
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,639
Thanks, Chico.

167
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,998
Put some on this
grave too, John.

168
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,475
- Who are they, Dad?
- A poor family of pioneers...

169
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,869
...who came here
many years ago.

170
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,439
They were attacked
by bandits.

171
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,670
The wife and the kids
were murdered.

172
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,318
The husband
was wounded.

173
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,916
Your mother came here often
to put flowers on the grave.

174
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,594
- And where is the husband?
- I have no idea.

175
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,956
We cared for him until he recovered
and soon after, he left.

176
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,474
This man had
lost all his faith.

177
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,509
And they say, his gun talks more
and more frequently ever since.

178
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,670
But let's go now, boys.
It is late already.

179
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,072
Tonight, you'll meet the Demorlays,
our neighbors, respectable folks.

180
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,069
Guns and rifles everywhere.
Infants sucking on bullets.

181
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,029
Duels - yes, we had
an eventful arrival.

182
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,319
Yes... this is not Boston, but there's
lots of good people around here as well.

183
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,834
Mister!
There he is...

184
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,108
The collector is here.

185
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,912
- What's so secret?
- I'll explain it to you later.

186
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,595
Mrs. Carmen, may I ask you
to go upstairs for a moment.

187
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,115
- And you, too.
- Yes, Mister.

188
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,395
And now, whatever happens,
stay calm, boys.

189
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,438
- Understood? Stay calm.
- Good day.

190
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,469
- Come with me.
- I'm coming, too.

191
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,597
Then I won't have to
see him once more.

192
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,954
Let's go.

193
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,514
Listen, Pedro!

194
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,750
Your father will
explain it to you.

195
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,071
What's that all about?
Who's that guy?

196
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,795
Look, Mr. John -

197
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,588
...your father didn't
want to tell you...

198
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,557
They battered him
like that!

199
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,756
- Shot him to pieces!
- For God's sake, Pedro!

200
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,958
- Why did they do it? Why?
- I'm Chico, Mister.

201
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,229
Hey you blown-up cock!
Wait a second!

202
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,315
- Are you talking to me, youngster?
- Don't call me youngster!

203
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,559
As you wish, junior.
And now tell me what you're up to.

204
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,392
- But do it quick!
- These are my sons.

205
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,152
They came back home
from the east today.

206
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,913
They don't know anything
about the issue.

207
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,350
- That's better.
- I wouldn't say that!

208
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,590
We demand
an explanation!

209
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,152
You hear that?

210
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,029
Calm.

211
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,794
Stay calm.

212
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,913
You must know, it's not like
it is in the east over here.

213
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,472
This here's a
wild piece of land...

214
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,950
...where only a few
real bright people get by.

215
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,793
Also the breeders,
you know?

216
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,919
There are some thugs
wreaking havoc around here.

217
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,354
Fellas who shoot the cattle,
poison the wells, set houses afire!

218
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,759
Fellas...

219
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,518
...who kill.

220
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,030
But your father and his friends
are lucky enough...

221
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,359
...to have us.

222
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,477
And we -
for a fistful dollars -

223
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,190
...make sure that
those things won't happen.

224
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,999
You can tell your boss
that the party is over.

225
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,752
Oh, excuse me, Mister,
that wasn't on purpose!

226
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,915
You just made a big mistake.
You'll pay for that.

227
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,150
- Kick him out!
- At once!

228
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,072
Here you are, Mister.

229
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,234
- Not on purpose!
- Out with him!

230
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,639
Mister...

231
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,672
Very nice, boys.
Good work.

232
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,440
Forgive me, father, but I couldn't
take that humiliation.

233
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,159
You can't fight anymore,
but we young folks can.

234
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,071
Alright, my son.

235
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,917
The McIntires...

236
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,550
...are back in the ring.

237
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,597
Let's hope that this Toland
won't back out.

238
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,433
If he's like Pedro described him,
then he won't.

239
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,919
Let's go.

240
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,712
- There are the racketeers.
- Quick, George!

241
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,439
Let's try to
reach the house!

242
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,358
So young and so stupid
to think...

243
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,556
...it would save your life
if you came here unarmed.

244
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,596
But your boss
miscalculated a little.

245
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,638
But... Mr. Toland,
we, we're not...

246
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,517
We're the sons of
Rhett McIntire.

247
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,477
The sons of McIntire.

248
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,836
Oh, then you're the ones
who kicked out the collector.

249
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,195
- Yes, that was me.
- Bad move.

250
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,397
You should have shot
him like a jackal.

251
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,072
You can go, boys.

252
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,030
We want to bring back peace
to this piece of land.

253
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,759
And it has to start by
enforcing the law without killing.

254
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,990
- It can't go on like that...
- If you came to me...

255
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,197
...to ask for help then you
made this trip for nothing.

256
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,431
I only know one way to live
in peace around this area.

257
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,396
But Mr. Toland!

258
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,755
You can't hold a gun in your hand
for the rest of your life.

259
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,956
- Join us!
- And what would that be good for?

260
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,510
After the very first shot, you'd
keep on paying just like before.

261
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,592
Boy, they also sent
a collector to me.

262
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,114
Look, he lies over there,
underneath the cross.

263
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,270
Ever since
I have my peace.

264
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,909
Wake up!
This here is the only law.

265
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,436
Fine, I do what I can, judge.
Sure, it's not going well.

266
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,273
The boys are right.
But I'm just a single man...

267
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,113
...all alone against these coyotes.
- Now we're here.

268
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,269
That's right, George!

269
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,511
Son, faith and enthusiasm alone
won't be enough for this.

270
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,273
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.
The people here are scared.

271
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,918
They even come to
these jackals' defense.

272
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,434
That's exactly the point.
We have to convince the people...

273
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,192
...to revolt against
these criminals. United.

274
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,794
Once we are united,
these bandits will tremble with fear.

275
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,233
Without having
to kill someone.

276
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,073
I don't really believe it,
but one can try.

277
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,879
We must, Sir, we must force
these murderers to show themselves.

278
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,154
Fine.

279
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,796
Bring me the culprit
and I will be implacable.

280
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,029
We will.

281
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,554
Even if we have to turn the
whole country upside down.

282
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,672
It's no use, Mister,
we have...

283
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,193
We've been talking to
everyone around here.

284
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,077
But they're slamming
their doors into our faces.

285
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,991
And they also
make strange signs.

286
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,036
- What kind of signs?
- That kind.

287
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,114
They don't talk because
they're afraid of the bandits.

288
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,351
Well. Except for Toland.
And he's violent.

289
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,795
Then we have to
do it on our own.

290
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,513
- Mister, I have an idea!
- He has an idea! Him!

291
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,434
Instead of walking around and
asking questions like some peddler...

292
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,715
...why don't we
look for the collector?

293
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,677
He's right!
If we manage to catch him...

294
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,478
...we could
make him talk!

295
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,154
I hardly believe that
after last time's incident...

296
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,710
...they'll be sending him to us, right?
- Are you looking for me?

297
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,993
I saved you
some efforts.

298
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,993
After all, we still have
a score to settle, right?

299
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,516
I told you from the start
that you'll pay for that!

300
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,718
The river will
make you disappear.

301
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,078
I've always been a friend of
clean work without witnesses.

302
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,272
Get out!

303
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,718
Or do you believe you can
still swim, filled with lead?

304
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,792
One minute.

305
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,711
Hey you, freeze!

306
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,112
- You're talking to me?
- Yeah, you. Get off.

307
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,751
- Put down the belt and come here.
- And why?

308
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,639
Put it down!

309
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,110
Come here and stand
next to the others.

310
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,832
You, get out there!

311
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,077
You don't mind
joining the party, do you?

312
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,354
No.

313
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,829
- But who invited me?
- What do you mean?

314
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,559
That I like
to know my hosts.

315
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,279
And why should you
know our names?

316
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,911
I do have to write something on it -
on your graves, right?

317
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,629
A bad day, right?

318
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,996
Mister, I feel obligated -
I mean, we'd like to, well...

319
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,868
If it causes you that much trouble,
you don't have to thank me.

320
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,475
- I can do it, Mister. I'd love to!
- George!

321
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,869
Mister, it's my duty
to thank you.

322
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,474
But you should know that I don't
approve of your methods.

323
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,313
Of course, everybody may
think what he likes.

324
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,551
- But if I may give you an advice...
- That would be a pleasure, Mister!

325
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,995
I wouldn't run around
naked if I was you.

326
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,470
Something could easily
catch a cold - forever.

327
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,712
This man seems
right to me.

328
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,918
We also have to arm ourselves
if that's a tradition around here.

329
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,960
- We're no killers.
- Why?

330
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,838
Is someone who defends
himself a killer?

331
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,593
He was fast as lightning.
Quick as a viper.

332
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,477
They all pissed
their pants.

333
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,358
But I went to
challenge him in his room!

334
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,797
Jazz, I said, get out of
the door if you got courage!

335
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,118
Hey you, I'm not done yet.
So, he said to me...

336
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,395
Take this bag.

337
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,992
Who, me?

338
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,472
And carry it upstairs.

339
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,069
Me!

340
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,749
- Me...
- Please.

341
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,910
- Me...!
- You what?

342
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,510
I'll take
the bag upstairs.

343
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,591
Fine, I like
helpful people.

344
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,910
- Is my room ready?
- Yes, yes, yes, it's ready, Mister.

345
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,116
- Something to drink for my friend.
- A drink for your friend.

346
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,829
And bring me a bottle
to that table.

347
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,879
There it is.

348
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,397
Only the bottle.

349
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,517
A nice cup if you
allow me the remark!

350
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,079
I do.

351
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,393
It's the only remembrance
of my father.

352
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,077
He was a nobleman or something.
Never met him.

353
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,953
My mother though,
was a little slut.

354
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,070
I'm more like her.

355
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,911
- Give us some good whiskey.
- At once.

356
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,070
- And a deck of cards.
- Okay.

357
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,474
Let's see if there's
a free table.

358
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,871
- Ah, there!
- Very good.

359
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,990
Do you mind if I shake these poor fellas
down of a couple dollars at this table?

360
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,996
If you like, I could
relieve you of some, too.

361
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,512
You see, boys, what only one cup
too much can do to someone?

362
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,433
Let's sit down,
he won't even notice us.

363
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,352
No, my friend,
I don't like that at all.

364
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,398
And I really fancy
a little game right now!

365
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,039
Then we will see
if you like this game.

366
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,598
You're lucky, man.

367
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,399
I don't kill
if I don't profit from it.

368
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,473
That applies to you, too.
Buzz off! The party is over.

369
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,596
Work with
tactfulness, Duke.

370
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,513
But please.
A barbarian without style.

371
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,989
The world
is quite small, right?

372
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,071
Yes, yes. Too small.

373
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,833
Well, then you better
change the spot!

374
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,111
You do know
the rules, don't you?

375
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,273
- Never in pairs at the same feeder.
- Yeah, I know the rule.

376
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,078
But I have to take care
of some things here.

377
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,832
And you know
what it's like in our job:

378
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,388
The customer is king.

379
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,836
- Why don't you change the spot?
- You see...

380
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,639
I also have to take care
of some things here.

381
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,279
- You know how it is.
- May I?

382
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,990
Yes, you're right.
The customer is king.

383
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,032
If that's so...

384
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,313
...there's no other choice.
- I think so, too.

385
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,993
Take your hands down!
You too!

386
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,993
- If you allow?
- I don't allow it!

387
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,991
No, no, no, gentlemen,
I don't allow it!

388
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,753
If you don't mind,
that's on the house!

389
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,077
You'll let me know if you
need some ammunition, alright?

390
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,357
You'll thank me for this,
I'm sure about that!

391
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,637
- See you very soon!
- Bye, see you!

392
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,919
How the hell
do you fix that?

393
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,991
Two beers, please.

394
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,156
Okay. But drink up fast
and listen carefully:

395
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,879
If you never put another foot in
here again, you'd do me a big favor!

396
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,235
You can put your mind at rest,
we only have the best intentions.

397
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,073
One could think
you're afraid of us, aren't you?

398
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,151
In the end, you're friends
with these racketeers.

399
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,071
Me?
I'm friends with everyone.

400
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,516
I say with everyone,
but not with them!

401
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,115
No, I just handle
my own stuff.

402
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,228
- Hey boys!
- Yes?

403
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,518
The price tag.

404
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,151
A nanny.
That's precious.

405
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,879
You, Stranger, are playing
the nanny for these two kiddies.

406
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,794
Duke, did you ever think
about your reputation?

407
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,272
You can't shoot at two kiddies,
as you call them!

408
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,117
Two kiddies who still have the
price tag hanging from their colts.

409
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,758
You're right.

410
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,753
My client
should have told me.

411
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,230
But what should I do now?
I accepted that assignment.

412
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,994
I can hardly wait
for them to grown up.

413
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,275
I, on the contrary,
really like that.

414
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,310
I like watching them
growing up.

415
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,030
- I hope it's not for nothing.
- But no, Mister.

416
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,556
Manuel knew the collector.
He's from our village.

417
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,996
He's the brother of the cousin
of the wife of Pedro's godfather.

418
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,038
No, he's the cousin
of the sister!

419
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,069
That's enough.

420
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,396
They saw you, tramp.
Come down.

421
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,390
Yes, Mister.

422
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,948
But, Mister, I,
I didn't do anything!

423
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,349
I... please, Mister!
But...

424
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,069
We'll take care
of him later. Quick!

425
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,394
When they arrive at the
tree over there, you shoot!

426
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,073
Yes, damn...

427
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,593
Kill them!

428
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,517
Mister, I'd like...
You see, we'd like to...

429
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,795
We'd like to
tell you that...

430
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,154
- You see...
- So?

431
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,959
We're really grateful for everything
you have done for us.

432
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,314
For saving our lives.

433
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,834
And most of all that
you've shown us that you...

434
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,514
...even if you just want
to enforce the law...

435
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,033
...you have
to use a gun.

436
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,839
- We owe you...
- You're up to your neck in shit.

437
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,990
- Isn't it so?
- Yes, yes! That's right, Mister.

438
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,435
- Yes, that's right! But...
- You want to keep your tails up, right?

439
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,272
Right! Even if they
tear us apart!

440
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,635
And you almost
accomplished that.

441
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,551
- Is that all?
- Er, no, in fact...

442
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,790
...we wanted to ask you
to help us a little.

443
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,677
We must learn
to defend ourselves...

444
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,910
...if we want to get out
of that situation.

445
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,195
We do know that you
have no reason to do it.

446
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,759
The bandits
didn't harm you.

447
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,274
Before you speak you should
bite your tongue seven times!

448
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,830
- I just wanted to say...
- I know what you wanted to say.

449
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,397
I'll help you.
But to one condition:

450
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,391
Nobody may
find out about it.

451
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,873
Be quick when you draw.
And precise when you shoot.

452
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,551
Widen your belt a little.
It must sit deeper.

453
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,313
Next to your hand.
Like this.

454
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,719
Alright, Mister.

455
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,109
I'd really love
a sip of coffee, too!

456
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,636
Not during the training.
Only makes you nervous.

457
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,715
And...
never face the sun.

458
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,349
How often did I tell you,
you must have the sun in your back.

459
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,477
So. Come on.
Let's do it, men.

460
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,915
If you keep going like this, boys,
you can only hope...

461
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,468
...that your opponent
will die of fear.

462
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,391
Give me that gun.

463
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,675
It's like a butterfly.

464
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,955
If you squeeze it
too tight, it'll choke.

465
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,759
If you don't hold it
tight enough, it'll fly away.

466
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,989
Clear?

467
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,348
Take one more look at
how to draw and how to aim.

468
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,555
It's quite easy.

469
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,269
You cock while you draw
and shoot while you aim.

470
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,956
Good.
And now you keep trying.

471
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,753
- Like this?
- You take too long, John.

472
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,229
The guy opposing you won't wait
for you until he shoots.

473
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,313
And you, Irishman,
don't pull a show for pretty girls.

474
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,118
It's quite
alright already.

475
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,839
- Can you see this can in the center?
- Yes.

476
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,117
Good.
Imagine, it was a man.

477
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,111
And if you don't
want him to kill you...

478
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,553
...you must think
of three things:

479
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,598
First of all, you mustn't
hate this man.

480
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,194
You just have to try
to shoot him one moment...

481
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,396
...before he shoots you.
- That's very noble, Mister.

482
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,314
No, that's not noble at all.
That's just practical.

483
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,638
Hate paralyzes the reflexes.
It's an advantage for your enemy.

484
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,836
You shoot with the brain first,
then with the gun.

485
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,957
If I shoot him in my mind,
the hand will be quicker.

486
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,871
Quicker than his.
Like that!

487
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,275
You see?
Very simple.

488
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,033
- Simple, he said.
- And now:

489
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,749
Practice, practice
and practice.

490
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,116
Fine, men,
now it's your turn.

491
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,078
- Yes, Mister!
- You, Pedro...

492
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,158
Can you see that can?

493
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,835
- I can see it! I can see it very well!
- Fine. Go ahead.

494
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,353
Shall I shoot?

495
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,069
Now!

496
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,713
No, not like this.

497
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,031
- Try it again, come on.
- I'm sorry, Mister...

498
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,917
...but this is not meant for us.
- That's right!

499
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,434
We're better with these!

500
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,399
Look!

501
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,313
And Pedro is much
better than me, Mister!

502
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,153
- You want to see it?
- No, that's enough.

503
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,155
But you also have to shoot
with guns, like the others.

504
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,357
No, Mister, not with guns.
With these, if there's any need.

505
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,510
They make lots of holes
with one single shot.

506
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,670
- And do you know how to use them?
- Sure, Mister!

507
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,832
Like this and then...

508
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,673
Watch, how it's done.
I'll do it slowly, so you understand.

509
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,634
Clear?

510
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,437
Clear, he asks!

511
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,949
I load these with
a special powder!

512
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,950
I heard about that.
And I hope it's true - for you.

513
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,235
I especially came to this
damned village because of them.

514
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,595
Hey, I advice you
to serve him well.

515
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,989
He's someone who
knows these things.

516
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,109
- Hello, Cobra Ramirez.
- Hello, Stranger.

517
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,314
- You're here because of a job?
- Because of these.

518
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,638
What do you
think of it?

519
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,518
- They're a blast!
- I'd like to try them.

520
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,591
Not with me, I hope.

521
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,349
You're not lucky enough
to be my friend -

522
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,273
...but you're also not that
unlucky to be not.

523
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,438
You're in real good shape, Cobra.
You're one of the great ones.

524
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,751
I already said that in the
saloon yesterday evening.

525
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,717
And I told them
about these, too.

526
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,950
What are these?
Scalps?

527
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,349
So to speak.

528
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,194
When Cobra Ramirez kills someone
he always cuts off a strand of hair...

529
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,558
...to serve the bill, right?
But there's a guy jumping up and he said:

530
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,278
"Then why doesn't he
become a hairdresser...

531
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,237
...instead of a gunslinger?"
- Who?

532
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,996
Ah, don't mind it, Cobra.
Those people are just jealous.

533
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,035
Spit it out.
Tell me who it is!

534
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,879
So!

535
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,432
It was you?

536
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,033
Answer me!
You said it?

537
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,517
For the last time,
did you say it or not?

538
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,670
Listen, I didn't say it.

539
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,593
I don't give a shit about
what my colleagues do.

540
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,399
And now I'd like to drink
my whiskey in peace.

541
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,994
- See you around!
- You're a filthy pig!

542
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,868
- A coward. Scum!
- Yeah, possible.

543
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,477
Listen, would you mind
stepping aside?

544
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,791
I'd like to see if someone else
is standing back there.

545
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,753
Defend yourself!

546
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,629
- Defend yourself, son of a bitch!
- Ah! So you knew her?

547
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,717
The next one will get a
little closer if you don't get up!

548
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,518
Compliments.

549
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,830
You pushed
the right button.

550
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,955
You don't know how much
this cup means to me.

551
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,519
It took you long
enough anyway.

552
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,034
- Would you like one last whiskey?
- No.

553
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,190
Let's do it then?
Where would you like to do it?

554
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,998
I don't care.

555
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,752
Then back there.

556
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,755
We'll shoot
at three, okay?

557
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,230
Step a little back.

558
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,312
That's good.

559
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,435
- Whenever you're ready.
- Okay.

560
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,068
One...

561
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,788
Two...

562
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,995
Three!

563
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,829
Hey.
Where is the Stranger?

564
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,478
He left
all of the sudden.

565
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,916
Almost exactly in the moment
when you, so to speak...

566
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,916
This son of...

567
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,398
A real brother.

568
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,032
- And, did we hit it?
- Did we hit it?

569
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,158
- That was all me!
- No, me, me!

570
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,636
- Mister, once more, okay?
- Okay!

571
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,232
What do you think about
walking two steps with us?

572
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,276
Well, don't you want to know
where we're going, gunslinger?

573
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,271
Over there, at the hills,
we'll kill you!

574
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,510
At the the hills,
you won't kill anybody...

575
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,079
...otherwise, you would have
tried already.

576
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,071
Oh look, your boss is
already waiting for us.

577
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,116
He wants to see me.

578
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,550
Is that supposed to be
the big surprise?

579
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,677
Seems like it wasn't that hard
to catch the Stranger.

580
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,479
As you can see,
you're not irreplaceable.

581
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,113
Good day!

582
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,435
To you too!

583
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,637
I offer you a deal.
A good deal.

584
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,154
I came to think that
it's nonsense...

585
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,390
...to set two of the best shots
in the country on each other.

586
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,118
That's the coalition,
gentlemen.

587
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,668
The coalition!
Right, Stranger?

588
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,230
Fine. I need the both of you.
To punish the rebels.

589
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,072
I know your price,
Stranger.

590
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,037
I'll double it,
triple it!

591
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,599
That's an
interesting offer.

592
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,797
But the thing is,
I already have a client.

593
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,555
And you know what
it's like in our job, Duke:

594
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,835
The customer is king.

595
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,236
- I knew it.
- What do you mean?

596
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,153
If he came,
then because he wanted to.

597
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,150
Stranger! Show us what you got
back there, underneath the blanket!

598
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,268
Stop!

599
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,554
What did I tell you?

600
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,155
He knows the job!
And never betrays a client.

601
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,959
- What does that mean?
- Don't you understand that he has a plan?

602
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,077
Ah, you talk
too much, Duke!

603
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,950
He's making
a monkey out of you.

604
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,828
Well, I'm leaving then -
you'll surely come to visit me again.

605
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,191
And that will cost you
quite something.

606
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,555
Because I'm no
small-time crook.

607
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,070
What 's up? Does shaving against
the grain give you goosebumps?

608
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,470
Okay,
you can go, Duke.

609
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,471
- You're staying a little, huh?
- Sure.

610
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,676
The offer is tempting.

611
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,519
- Does he feel insulted?
- He can go to hell.

612
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,478
- I want to bargain with you.
- Fine.

613
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,393
But I like to look
my client in the face.

614
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,597
You know,
as a guaranty for my pay.

615
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,636
Sounds plausible.

616
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,195
You'll pay for that!

617
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,589
Fortunately, Pedro saw...

618
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,511
...that they took you away!
- Yeah, that was real luck.

619
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,558
- We came exactly in the right moment!
- Very good, exactly in the right moment.

620
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,949
- Just one more second...
- They simply would have killed you...

621
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,075
...like a greenhorn!
- Sure.

622
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,673
Just one more second
and I could have found out...

623
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,038
...who's the boss of the blackmailers!
You damned botchers.

624
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,153
- But we wanted to help you.
- Come on, stop it!

625
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,470
I had enough
of playing your nanny.

626
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,394
The world was already invented
before you two arrived.

627
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,315
And if she's shitty then it's definitely
not you two who will fix her.

628
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,118
Thanks for everything
you have done.

629
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,599
But in future,
we'll make it without you!

630
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,671
We're even, gunslinger!

631
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,711
Attention,
there he comes.

632
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,948
Let's go.

633
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,672
No, no coffins
made to measure.

634
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,439
The tallest of the three
fits in there perfectly.

635
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,080
I just wanted him to
look good, you know?

636
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,197
I don't think that
this still matters to him.

637
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,595
Hello Camposanto!

638
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,717
Did you know that they call you
that around here now, cemetery?

639
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,598
- My compliment.
- You can compliment yourself.

640
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,993
Now your boss won't do
without you anymore.

641
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,993
By the way, thanks for
the collaboration yesterday.

642
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,389
Well, you did that
favor to me.

643
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,474
- Now I'm the only one far and wide.
- Well.

644
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,677
Now you can
make the price.

645
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,630
Look, there's
something big going on.

646
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,234
The breeders allied.

647
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,958
Stranger, may I
ask you a favor?

648
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,917
A... what?

649
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,711
Fa-vo-r.

650
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,918
You had your fun.
Now go and leave the finale up to me.

651
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,228
Do you know
what I mean?

652
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,471
That they'll pay you plenty
if you stay the course, right?

653
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,836
If it matters,
the others count no more.

654
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,391
I have to do my work, Stranger.
Whatever comes my way.

655
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,192
I know, Duke.

656
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,434
But whatever
comes my way -

657
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,556
...I'll make you sweat.

658
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,868
Silence, gentlemen!
Let John McIntire speak.

659
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,235
And why?
Hasn't he caused enough trouble already?

660
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,598
Exactly! Ever since they revolted against
the collectors, they're ruining us all!

661
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,194
They poisoned
the well on my ranch!

662
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,316
Yesterday, they shot
ten of my cows.

663
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,436
And twenty today!
And it's getting worse!

664
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,192
It's all their fault.

665
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,840
Aw, stop it already!
We let them milk us like cows.

666
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,388
They already relieved us
of thousands of dollars!

667
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,313
What's the McIntires fault?
That they made an end to this?

668
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,152
Shut up,
you didn't get it yet!

669
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,150
He's absolutely right!

670
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,595
Seems like he
wants them to kill us all.

671
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,989
- He's right!
- Silence!

672
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,959
Silence! Please.
Gentlemen!

673
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,996
This won't
get us anywhere!

674
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:14,198
We're here to make a decision,
not to fight each other.

675
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,236
Let Toland speak.

676
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,709
Toland, you asked for
this meeting. What now?

677
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,909
Friends.

678
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,595
I'm the first one to respect
the courage of these boys.

679
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,908
Once, I was
courageous, too.

680
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,912
- And you know what I got out of it?
- Yes! Yes! Keep talking!

681
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,911
- Yeah! Keep talking!
- Alright.

682
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,116
And you know why
that happened to me?

683
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,679
Because these
jackals think...

684
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,751
...I'm acting in collusion
with the McIntires.

685
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,910
Listen, boys.
You too, Rhett.

686
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,072
I was always playing tough,
that's true.

687
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,674
But I never stepped
on anyone's feet!

688
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,438
Toland! You know damn well that
my boys acted in everyone's interest.

689
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,432
Maybe.
But now we have to pay for this.

690
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,957
Toland! Toland!

691
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,555
These pigs set the repositories
on your ranch on fire.

692
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,676
- I tried to follow them, but...
- Yeah, sure, Sheriff.

693
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,558
You tried to follow them.
You never succeed beyond trying!

694
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,039
- Am I right?
- Oh yeah?

695
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,635
And I'm supposed to catch
some bullets for you?

696
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,751
The two dollars they pay me
a day aren't worth that.

697
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,596
- Here, take it back.
- Come on, Sheriff, nobody's doubting you.

698
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,955
You better tell us
what happened.

699
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,758
I saw the smoke
and rode there.

700
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,989
There was a
whole bunch of them.

701
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,911
I tried to cut off
their way...

702
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,718
...but they
shot at me.

703
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,995
And then, at the ranch of the McIntires,
they suddenly disappeared.

704
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,877
What are you
implying, Sheriff?

705
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,269
- Stay calm, my son.
- John...

706
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,676
...I'm just saying
what I saw.

707
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,876
I lost their track
on your ranch.

708
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,190
Where, by the way,
nothing ever happened, right?

709
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,589
Exactly! He's the only one
they didn't mess with.

710
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,240
- Don't you think that's strange?
- Silence!

711
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,276
You have to take back
what you just said, right now.

712
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,910
Do you think,
I'm afraid of you, junior?

713
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,673
Well! You're not that brave
when you're facing the bandits.

714
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,113
Did you hear that?

715
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,395
- Now they're calling us cowards!
- Cripes...

716
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,118
Take your hands off!

717
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,508
- Just stay calm!
- Stop it!

718
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,477
- It's enough!
- Will you...

719
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,788
Stop it now!

720
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,350
- You'll wreck my whole place!
- Silence!

721
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,116
Will you stop it!

722
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,794
- What's going on in there?
- A brawl! Let's go!

723
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,838
- That should be better.
- But no. In there, man!

724
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,912
- Do you want to abandon the Masters?
- No!

725
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:37,269
Hey! Where are you going?
This way, coward!

726
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,869
Who's going to repair all this?
Stop it!

727
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,556
- Stop!
- No, please don't, leave that...

728
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,993
No!

729
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,559
Attention!

730
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,393
Damn it, those idiots!

731
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,118
- Hence with it!
- Here he is!

732
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,873
- Not to me!
- I don't want him!

733
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,713
In the name of the law,
stop it!

734
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,872
- Oh, excuse me, my friend!
- You son of a bitch!

735
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,876
My clavus!

736
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,515
Thanks, Dad!

737
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,473
Bravo, Dad!

738
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,310
- Is that yours, by any chance?
- Yeah! But I still have another one.

739
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,117
Thanks, judge!

740
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,474
That's enough now!

741
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,397
Hey! Hey!

742
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,719
Pedro!

743
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,353
- But, who hit me?
- A gringo! But I crushed him.

744
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,317
Ouch, that hurts!

745
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,711
That little blood...

746
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,597
Hey! And?

747
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,758
Yes, John, that's
the Sheriff's saddle.

748
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,910
But are you sure
that you're alright?

749
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,831
- Oh, Mister...
- Ah, Chico!

750
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,390
- I'm Pedro.
- Good, Pedro...

751
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,830
- How much does a saddle like this cost?
- Chin up, John.

752
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,876
We'll go to pick up Daddy
and then we'll go home.

753
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,916
- A nice bath will do you good.
- But, don't you understand...

754
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,309
...what I'm trying to say, wise guy?
How much, Chico?

755
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,719
Pedro...!

756
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,078
- This saddle - well, about 400 dollars.
- 400 dollars...

757
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,196
Listen, George, you're good
at maths, aren't you?

758
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,998
If someone earns
two dollars a day...

759
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,470
...how long will it take him
to afford a saddle like this?

760
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:32,516
But who earns
two dollars a day?

761
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,948
Hello, Sheriff!
How are you?

762
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,273
What do you want?

763
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,158
You didn't wake me up,
to wish me good night, did you?

764
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,116
Do you know
what time it is?

765
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,111
- Yeah, Sheriff, but...
- So get lost and go to bed.

766
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,351
- Yeah, I know, it's just, me and, um...
- You and who?

767
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,953
Spit it out, what the hell
do you want?

768
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:52,112
Well, we've been asking ourselves,
well, how you manage...

769
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,031
How I manage
to do what?

770
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,918
Well, two dollars
aren't that much, I think.

771
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,036
What are you
trying to say?

772
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,871
What does that mean,
two dollars aren't much?

773
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,313
Yes exactly,
that's precious little.

774
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,119
That's why the calculation
didn't work.

775
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,794
Okay, Pedro.
Go to bed...

776
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,996
...and come back tomorrow,
when you've slept out your flush.

777
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,389
It crossed our mind
that you, Mister...

778
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,232
...that you act in collusion
with the bandits.

779
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:18,313
Well, that you are, so to speak,
part of the band.

780
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,279
But what a thought, Pedro.
Is that your personal or...

781
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,998
But yes, yes, yes, Mister,
my very personal!

782
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,277
And that's why you came in the middle
of the night, to tell me that?

783
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,032
- Is that it?
- Of course, Sheriff.

784
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,839
All alone and
in the middle of the night.

785
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,832
Why don't you
come in?

786
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,480
We'll have a little drink and you
tell me some more about your funny idea.

787
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,790
Thank you very much, Sheriff!
Please, after you.

788
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,872
Aw, come on, get in,
don't cause yourself inconvenience.

789
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,875
Hey... Pedro!

790
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,638
I think, you're
a little loco, my friend.

791
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,030
Another hit
and I sure am.

792
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:14,671
How come, you suddenly
forgot your good upbringing?

793
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,228
You wanted to go inside
in front of the gringo?

794
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,313
- Chico! What did you do to him?
- We just exchanged some caresses.

795
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,358
Untie me, boys!
Stop this drunken madman!

796
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,670
You shouldn't have
done that.

797
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,270
Listen, Mister.
I'm just a poor workman.

798
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,918
I can neither
read nor write.

799
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,992
But if I look into the eyes of someone,
I know what's in his heart.

800
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,150
And I'm telling you, that gringo
would have shot me...

801
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,832
...after I told him,
what I think of him.

802
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,512
Don't listen tom him,
he's a liar!

803
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,953
He couldn't shoot me
in the street...

804
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,234
...so he politely invited me
into his house.

805
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,390
You don't believe that a gringo
invites someone like me into his house.

806
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,472
No, those people only need us
to muck out their pig sties.

807
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,915
You don't believe the gibberish
of this unlucky fellow, do you?

808
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,718
Look at him, John.
He's at the end of his ropes.

809
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,518
Let's let them
sort this out their way.

810
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,070
He has no choice, Mister.
If he won't talk -

811
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,549
...I'll kill him!
- You're an American, just like me, son!

812
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,437
You're not going to
allow these dirty savages...

813
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,080
...to lay their hands on me, right?
- He's all yours.

814
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:18,357
You dirty pigs! I want to see you
with folded hands inside a coffin!

815
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,749
Listen closely, Sheriff.

816
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,355
You see these knifes?

817
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,713
I'll pick up one
after another, randomly.

818
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,509
And whenever I count to five
I'll throw one of them in your direction.

819
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,989
One of them
is marked -

820
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:40,959
...and that one will make you
meet your Maker.

821
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:46,831
So, if you're lucky,
you'll live four times until five.

822
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:51,869
If you're not, you'll only
hear me count once.

823
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:52,995
You'll pay for this!

824
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,469
- I'll kill you all!
- Sure, that's what you would do.

825
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,632
You would have done that to them, too.
You would do everything for the money.

826
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,995
- What money?
- You know that very well.

827
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,594
The money you stole from my father
and the other breeders!

828
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,636
We want to know
where you hid it.

829
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,517
I don't know anything!

830
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,313
As you wish.

831
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,919
Chico!

832
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,594
One...

833
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,514
Two...

834
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,716
- Three...
- Stop him!

835
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,199
Four...

836
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,993
Five!

837
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,509
Good grace,
you're damn lucky!

838
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,634
One...

839
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,354
Two...

840
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,868
Three...

841
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,428
Four...

842
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,794
Five!

843
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,835
- So, will you make up your mind?
- I don't know a thing!

844
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,469
- I know nothing! I swear!
- You really are a lucky devil.

845
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,836
Maybe you'll live
once more until five.

846
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,319
- One...
- Yes, it's true!

847
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,152
- Two...
- I'm part of the plot!

848
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,116
Three...

849
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,351
- They made me do it!
- Four... Five!

850
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,635
They would have shot me.
I'm no hero!

851
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,870
I didn't want to die
for two dollars a day!

852
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,589
That's much better, Sheriff.
But there has got to be a boss.

853
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,592
- If you're not it, who is it?
- If I talk, they'll kill me.

854
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,079
But what difference
does it make?

855
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,390
If you don't talk,
Chico will kill you!

856
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,913
Chico!

857
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,231
Hey man!
Your time has come.

858
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,877
No. I don't want to die.
I don't know where the money is!

859
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,154
One...

860
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,798
- Two...
- Stop him!

861
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,359
- Three...
- No!

862
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,113
- Four...
- Stop! I'll talk!

863
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,668
- I'll tell you where the money is.
- So, you're the boss!

864
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,512
Only he would know!

865
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,114
Where did you
hide it, bandit?

866
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,072
Now listen closely.

867
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,355
In the meantime, my men
will have searched for me.

868
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,158
Forward, go!

869
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,669
You don't stand a chance.
They will shoot you like dogs.

870
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,954
A little faster, Mister.

871
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,715
Or the first one who dies
will be a dog with a star.

872
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:14,511
Be sensible for once, boys.
Now you got what you were after!

873
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,512
- Take the money and let me go.
- Sheriff...

874
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,556
...you still didn't
realize that you're...

875
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,278
...not in the position
to make proposals.

876
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,193
Very true, John.
Where is the money?

877
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,718
It's up there.

878
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,633
Help me.

879
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,468
Go!

880
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,632
- Chico! Take care of the Sheriff.
- Trust me, Mister.

881
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,392
I'll take care of him.

882
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,433
Careful, Mister!

883
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,677
- Up!
- Thanks, Mister!

884
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,068
We did it!

885
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,754
Chico!
He's up here!

886
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:28,037
The money, Chico!
We found it!

887
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,997
Thank God!

888
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,829
Damn it,
he outsmarted us!

889
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,069
What are you
doing here?

890
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,390
I told you
not to come here.

891
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,356
Something happened.

892
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,795
Those damned jackanapes
McIntires sniffed everything out.

893
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,950
They thought I was the boss
of the band and tortured me!

894
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,713
Now calm down.
Have a drink.

895
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,034
- Where are the boys?
- I took them to the monastery.

896
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,395
To the monastery!
Are you crazy?

897
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,915
What else should I do?

898
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,877
But I was clever,
they're stuck up there!

899
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,872
- Right next to the money!
- Yes, but they can't get away!

900
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:23,631
Another one.

901
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,633
And we can shut their trap
before they can alert the others.

902
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,595
Tell the Duke he should hold up
the Stranger and everything's fine.

903
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,193
One more, please.

904
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:37,115
By the way, partner, your killer couldn't
manage to lure the McIntires into a trap.

905
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,556
- Don't you think I'm in for a bonus?
- Sure, partner!

906
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,358
Don't like it.

907
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,636
Dead sheriffs aren't my cup of tea.
That's bandits' business.

908
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,712
What? You are telling me this!
A killer!

909
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,756
- A bastard of a killer!
- Sure, but by birth.

910
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,149
Someone like you becomes that
by pulling a heap of trickery.

911
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:07,198
Alright, Duke.
Let's not fight.

912
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,192
- I need you.
- That's better.

913
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:14,034
- But this time, I'll set the price.
- I'll give you another 5,000 dollars.

914
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,680
- But you have to hold up the Stranger.
- But of what use is it to you...

915
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,309
...if I only hold him up for an hour?
- An hour! What does that mean?

916
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,072
You know, the Stranger...

917
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,754
...is a tough case.
- You're a thief, Duke!

918
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:28,196
But of course!
Like any other respectable professional.

919
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,840
10,000. But you have to
hold him up until the crack of dawn.

920
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,559
The crack of dawn?
Crack of dawn is 20,000.

921
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,949
Ten.
That's my final offer.

922
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,669
I don't think your money will be
of much use when you're dead.

923
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,433
Don't you think?
20,000.

924
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,155
Agreed.
Let's go.

925
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,352
In advance, please.

926
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:53,350
Something tells me, as soon as
the work's done, you'll leave for Mexico.

927
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,876
And I don't plan
on running after you.

928
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,671
Do you think the bandits
will come here?

929
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,875
Yes.

930
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,475
You can be sure that the Sheriff
was in a hurry to get them.

931
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,996
Stay calm.
We will defend ourselves.

932
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,548
If only the Stranger
was with us.

933
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,154
- We should have walked back by foot.
- But no, George.

934
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,391
They would have caught us out there
which would have been much worse.

935
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,471
At least,
we have cover.

936
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,756
And also, how should we
have taken Chico with us?

937
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,751
We couldn't have left him behind.
They would have killed him.

938
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,400
Admittedly,
now they'll kill us all.

939
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,594
Chico! Stop clattering your teeth.
You're making me nervous.

940
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:36,874
I'm thirsty.

941
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,316
Have you seen some water
around here, by any chance?

942
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,637
- You're not afraid, are you?
- Um, no!

943
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,438
The Stranger will surely
be here on time.

944
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,080
- Are you sure about that?
- Well, so far, he came every time.

945
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,674
- Nobody notified him, Pedro.
- The other times as well.

946
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,796
That man
needs no notifications.

947
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,189
Nobody can stop him.

948
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,275
- Duke!
- Yes, Stranger!

949
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:29,399
I'm in a hurry, Duke.
I won't be able to stay.

950
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:32,711
Sorry about that, Stranger.
But you won't move a bit.

951
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,917
I'm very sorry, Duke,
but I have to move on.

952
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,152
- I can't hear you.
- Then listen to this.

953
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:50,912
Can't help it, friend.
I can't hear you.

954
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,548
- Did you hear me?
- Of course I heard you!

955
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:36,959
Take a look around.

956
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,873
- Who! Me?
- No! My grandpa! Go!

957
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,952
Take cover!

958
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,274
Go!

959
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,511
Forward!
Fight them back!

960
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,431
Shoot! Shoot!

961
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,636
It's useless.
They're covered in there.

962
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,951
We'll drag them out of there then.
Come with me.

963
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,471
John!
I got him!

964
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:37,076
If you stick your nose out there one
more time, it'll get a nice little scratch.

965
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,913
- John! Give me some bullets, quick!
- I can't, George!

966
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,517
I only have
three shots left.

967
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,359
- Chico! Ammunition!
- I only have these.

968
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,072
- Stranger!
- Yeah?

969
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:43,311
Very nice.
You decided to be good.

970
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,675
Like an angel.

971
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:48,515
A guardian angel, Duke.

972
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,913
Damn...

973
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:26,037
And what now, Duke?
May I go?

974
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,915
Just go, Stranger.

975
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,308
My contract just applies
until dawn.

976
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,030
And the sun is rising.

977
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,591
This is the moment, Fred.

978
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,716
They must have
run out of ammo.

979
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,870
We all shoot at the same time
and then we go!

980
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,951
- Tell the others!
- Alright.

981
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,031
Pedro! The knife.

982
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,959
What are those damned
bastards up to?

983
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,076
Why aren't they
shooting?

984
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,030
Shoot! Shoot!

985
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,118
Give me the bullets!

986
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,231
Attention.
They're coming.

987
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,075
Pretty Irishwoman! John!

988
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,228
Take them.

989
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,833
- That's Toland!
- He mustn't escape!

990
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,832
Hello, folks!

991
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,754
- The Stranger!
- Finally!

992
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:07,154
- Thanks and all that.
- Don't mention it.

993
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,159
Hey Chico!

994
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,908
- I need you for a minute.
- Me?

995
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,313
- Oh, the young Masters...
- Come!

996
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,759
Attention, George!

997
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,950
Nice shot, dear brother.

998
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,152
Where is the Stranger?

999
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,676
Ho! Ha! Mister!

1000
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,992
Chico! We've done it!
We made it!

1001
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,638
- The Stranger!
- Over there.

1002
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,995
Come on! Let's go.

1003
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,790
- Good. Nice work, boys.
- Thanks to you.

1004
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,110
Because once again you arrived
at the right moment, Mister...

1005
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,509
Camposanto, right?
That's what the bandits call you!

1006
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:05,910
- Cemetery! But for them!
- Exactly!

1007
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:10,278
Enough with the
compliments for now, boys.

1008
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,510
You annoy the hell
out of me.

1009
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,193
Get lost now.

1010
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,314
- But Mister, in there is still...
- I know, the breeders' money.

1011
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,789
I'll take that.
For the efforts.

1012
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:27,478
But we risked our lives
to get it back.

1013
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,879
We won't let you take it
away again that easy.

1014
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,679
However, it looks pretty
much like I will keep it.

1015
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,551
Go ahead, pick it up.

1016
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,949
I'll give you one minute
to lop off.

1017
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,959
Mister?

1018
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:58,350
Yes, yes,
that'll be better.

1019
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,910
And don't stop until you reached
your father's house!

1020
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:41,035
Very friendly, Duke.

1021
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,675
But they're
not that heavy.

1022
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:48,311
Oh yes, they are.
Twice as heavy as you might think.

1023
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:53,033
Toland is dead, Duke.
You don't have a contractor.

1024
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,236
You don't have to represent
anyone's interests anymore.

1025
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,437
Maybe not his.
But now I attend to mine.

1026
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:02,069
This money is mine, Duke.

1027
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,275
You may keep the other, friend.
I'm fine with one half.

1028
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,555
No. I don't share.

1029
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:18,438
This stuff caused me
enormous work, understand?

1030
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:21,671
And besides,
I'm too tired to fight.

1031
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,196
But if you downright
force me to...

1032
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:40,351
- I'm pigheaded, Stranger.
- You're too greedy.

1033
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,474
The money you took from Toland
isn't enough for you.

1034
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,313
Money is never enough for me.
I just have too many vices.

1035
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,278
I'll teach you
a little modesty.

1036
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,596
Forlorn hope.

1037
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:01,391
Many have tried that.
And they're dead.

1038
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,110
Do you have
one final wish?

1039
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,394
Yeah.

1040
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,795
I'm out of cigars.

1041
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,071
You want it
with golden handles?

1042
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:36,357
- What, the coffin?
- Of course! I want you to look good.

1043
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,749
You're a professional
with style.

1044
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,753
- When it stops, okay?
- Alright.

1045
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,671
When it stops,
we'll shoot.

1046
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,034
Farewell.

1047
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:38,677
That's the amusing part
of our profession.

1048
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,796
I could have sworn
that you didn't see him.

1049
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,872
I thought
you didn't see him.

1050
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,838
Good!
Then the next time.

1051
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,629
Sometime, we'll have to know
who's the quicker one, right?

1052
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,312
Um, sure.

1053
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:59,473
And maybe then it's about something
more valuable than a few stones.

1054
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,078
A few stones?

1055
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:12,477
But... but where
did all the dough go?

1056
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,118
In there.

1057
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,475
He told me
to hide it in there.

1058
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,949
Lo and behold!
Let's hurry!

1059
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,076
The Duke
could follow us!

1060
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,196
And we took him
for a bandit.

1061
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,919
- What a man.
- He should become supreme sheriff.

1062
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,798
Or even governor!

1063
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,509
Oh, no, Mister George,
that's impossible.

1064
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,919
Governors are all thiefs.

1065
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,395
To rob a colleague -

1066
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,468
...out of sheer
sentimentality!

1067
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,030
- You're the shame of our guild.
- I did tell you though...

1068
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,635
...the old McIntire
once saved my life.

1069
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,870
You risked your life
for this comedy.

1070
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,313
Seems so.

1071
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,152
Where are you
going now?

1072
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,677
Where will I go?
Wherever they pay me!

1073
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:04,470
In Abilaine they're looking for people
who are quick with the colt.

1074
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,519
They want to show
some rustlers the ropes.

1075
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:09,715
You're going there?

1076
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:12,234
Might throw
a glance at it.

1077
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:15,354
Abilaine is
up north, right?

1078
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,233
Hey Duke!

1079
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:31,712
- This way leads south!
- Exactly, brother.

1080
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,473
- If you're heading north...
- The important thing is that you're happy.

1081
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,120
- Concerning the "brother"...
- You just resemble me so much.

1082
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:40,351
You're just like me,
a true son of a bitch!
