Lillian Bell several days ago.

Can you hear me?

We're trying to establish the connection

between the corruption of this railroad

10
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:30,181
and its near total decimation.

understand what happened here.

to know my true self...

Is that anything that Springs up
between you and your woman...

176
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:59,003

wouldn't have come back alive.

00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:33,313
Them some nice shoes.

185
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:37,383
Clean.

186
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:42,185
Think you would've volunteered

187
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:44,421
to go out and scout a thousand Sioux?

188
00:14:46,857 --> 00:14:49,057

189
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:56,630
You riding out to the bridge?

190
00:14:56,665 --> 00:14:59,000
I am.

191
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:02,371
It's quite a milestone for you.

192
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:05,004
It's a milestone for all of us.

193
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,806
Which makes it an ideal time

194
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,575
to talk about your plans for the future.

195
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,941
Shall we?

196
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:28,026
[Chatter in background]

197
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:50,956
Don't you like New York?

198
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,929
I have found it's filled
with women like you.

199
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:56,564
Ohh.

200
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,734
You think
I'm cruel. Hmm?

201
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:06,575
Tell me... what would
you do in my place?

202
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,814
Thomas will write you a check and a letter

203
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:14,648
of introduction to a family
that's desperate for a governess.

204
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,581
A governess?

205
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:21,352
Please try and see this
in a positive light.

206
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,890
It's a respectable family...

207
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:29,229
With plenty of marriageable young men.

208
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:37,566
I'm putting a very bright
future in your hands.

209
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:40,303
Yes, you are.

210
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:42,036
Thank you.

211
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,817
Thank you for being the first one
to take her over, Mr. Bohannon.

212
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,981
There were no other volunteers, skipper.

213
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,782
Well, most folks ain't interested

214
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,650
in being crushed, boiled, or drowned.

215
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:02,318
Good luck, sir.

216
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:03,721

[Metal creaking]

221
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:39,834
It's all right, Mr. Durant.

222
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,174
It's just the wheels bearing to the track.

You did it, ya bastard!

228
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:58,362
All right, all right, all right.

229
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,764
She's not here, Mr. Bohannon.

230
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,734
Good job on the
bridge, Mr. Toole.

231
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:03,869
All right.

232
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,406
Hey, y'all, listen up!

233
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,042
Still got about a day's work ahead of us.

234
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,580
But there's a round
of drinks on Mr. Durant

235
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:12,583
waiting for you at the starlight tonight!

236
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:13,883
Yeah!
All right!

237
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:16,019
Come on, lads!
Back to work!

238
00:20:17,054 --> 00:20:19,123
You're welcome.

239
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:20,959
Don't get cocky.

240
00:20:20,993 --> 00:20:23,426
We are still nowhere
near where we need to be.

241
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,360
How far did you tell the board we were?

242
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:26,695
[Sighs]

243
00:20:26,729 --> 00:20:28,631
Leave the men to their work.

244
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:30,799
Whoa. Easy, easy, easy.

245
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:35,142
We need to talk.

246
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,376
You all right,
Mrs. Bell?

247
00:21:35,747 --> 00:21:37,550
Mr. Ferguson.

248
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:41,855
Yes. I'm just
closing the office.

249
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:47,427
Mr. Durant is down
at the bridge site.

250
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:51,696
Can I help you with something?

251
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,299
No, ma'am.

252
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:55,769
You have a good day.

253
00:21:55,803 --> 00:21:57,469
You, too.

254
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:34,448
It'd be nice to have some real walls,

255
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:37,285
keep out the cold, keep you warm.

256
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:41,652
If your looking for my
husband, he's at work.

257
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:43,619
I know where he at.

258
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,458
Want to have that talk we was
going to have before you left.

259
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:48,949
I've been back a while now,

260
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,830
how come this is the first
time you showed up?

261
00:22:50,864 --> 00:22:53,334
I got a surprise for you.

262
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:57,306
Surprises ain't been good in my experience.

263
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:58,775
This one is good.

264
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,812
For you and the baby.

265
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:05,152
You don't got to worry
about the baby no more.

266
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:08,923
Why you say that?

267
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:12,428
Because it's between me and my husband now.

268
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:15,530
He's got a future on this railroad.

269
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:17,600
I heard you quit.

270
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,405
I'm on my own now.

271
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,076
I built us a house down by the river.

272
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,582
Fresh water, land...

273
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:39,020
Place where the baby can grow up.

274
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:44,560
A good solid floor and freedom...

275
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:48,495
A fireplace that ain't that smoky.

276
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,764
Stop it.

277
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:52,168
All our love can live there.

278
00:23:52,202 --> 00:23:53,535
Can you stop it?

279
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:55,468
That ain't real.

280
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:56,802
Yeah, it is.

281
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,936
No, it ain't.

282
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:02,036
And I got to pretend that that don't exist.

283
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:05,907
Come on. Come on.

284
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:08,406
No, I got mending to do.

285
00:24:10,142 --> 00:24:12,981
Mr. Toole would be real angry
if he knew you were here.

286
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:15,950
You should probably go.

287
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:42,684
How would you like to be a very rich man?

288
00:24:42,718 --> 00:24:45,585
Seen a lot of rich men
end up in shallow graves.

289
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:49,421
When the board arrives, they will see
that I have misled the government

290
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,823
on their behalf. [Sighs]

291
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:53,492
They will move against me.

292
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:57,498
They may even try to have me imprisoned.

293
00:24:57,532 --> 00:25:02,605
The railroad will likely fail and,
well, you'll be out of a job.

294
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:05,008
I've been in worse spots.

295
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:10,014
I am offering you a full partnership...

296
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:14,148
If you will help me convince them

297
00:25:14,182 --> 00:25:16,650
that everything we have
done has been necessary.

298
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:27,131
Now, why would they believe me?

299
00:25:27,165 --> 00:25:32,002
You are an interesting
anomaly, Mr. Bohannon.

300
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:34,604
A gunslinger and an aristocrat.

301
00:25:34,638 --> 00:25:35,905
[Chuckles]

302
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:38,339
Yeah, wouldn't go that
far in either direction.

303
00:25:38,374 --> 00:25:41,908
Look, I am unwell.

304
00:25:41,943 --> 00:25:44,346
I simply need you to back me up.

305
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,180
What if they don't believe me?

306
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:51,922
Well, there's a good chance that
you will share in the blame.

307
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:53,925
And a jail cell.

308
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,561
From the moment you accept my offer,

309
00:25:56,596 --> 00:26:00,166
all your debts owing to me
will be forgiven.

310
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:08,943
All my debts to you were
buried with doc whitehead.

311
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,667
Sign the check.

312
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:34,604
[Sighs] I know her.

313
00:26:34,638 --> 00:26:37,841
She will not leave the railroad.

314
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:41,280
This is the best way
for us to be rid of her.

315
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:42,581
Is it?

316
00:26:42,615 --> 00:26:46,316
Have you done something
you Haven't told me about?

317
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:53,019
I will do this my way if your way fails.

318
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:55,055
Your way.

319
00:26:56,425 --> 00:27:00,528
As long as there's no mess.
Do you assure me?

320
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,966
I'll sign the check...

321
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,238
And then her fate will be
briefly in her hands...

322
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,941
Before it's in mine.

323
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:24,392
[Sighs]

324
00:27:32,873 --> 00:27:37,639
Mr. Durant has offered me a
permanent place with the railroad.

325
00:27:37,673 --> 00:27:40,974
[Chuckles] He, uh...

326
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:43,075
He offered me a partnership.

327
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:46,076
Then it must be your job he's offering me.

It's one of our horses. Shit.

331
00:28:02,195 --> 00:28:05,998
It's too dangerous
for you to be out here now.

332
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,279
I've been thinking about what you said.

333
00:28:19,314 --> 00:28:23,683
About all you have
is your job... and me.

334
00:28:23,717 --> 00:28:26,820
All I have is this railroad and you.

335
00:28:26,854 --> 00:28:29,022
We can build it together.

336
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,956
We already are.

337
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,725
Everything...

338
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,230
Everything to remove the
Durants is in this ledger.

False mileage, skimming
profits, the whole lot.

340

We can do this.

out and has you killed.

I guaran-damn-tee he's
already thought about it.

345
00:28:52,017 --> 00:28:54,554
How do you know?

346
00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:57,387
Like he said,

347
00:28:57,422 --> 00:29:00,558
me and him's different
sides of the same coin.

00:29:00,593 --> 00:29:03,793

00:30:50,263 --> 00:30:54,265
and ship it back east...

366
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,969
Ship it back east if something happens?

367
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:00,276
What kind of happen?

368
00:31:03,512 --> 00:31:07,250
In case I am killed,
Mr. Ferguson.

369
00:31:10,257 --> 00:31:12,190
Why not?

370
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,428
If a white woman dies and
a black man in the stew,

371
00:31:15,462 --> 00:31:16,698
who gonna hang?

372
00:31:16,732 --> 00:31:18,998
I'm just asking you to keep it.

373
00:31:19,032 --> 00:31:20,733
And I'm just saying no.

374
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:23,037
What have I done to offend you?

375
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:30,646
Please? Please?

376
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,386
Get on from here.
You on my property.

377
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,509
This is for Eva.

378
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,316
It's beautiful.

379
00:32:03,618 --> 00:32:05,881
Give me the damn package.

380
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:10,619
Thank you, thank you.

381
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:17,328
[Train whistle blowing]

382
00:32:36,508 --> 00:32:39,479
What's it mean when an
Indian paints hisself white?

383
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,318
Where did you see the white spirit?

384
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:49,356
Down at the gorge.
What's it mean?

385
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:58,263
The Sioux nation
wants everyone here to die.

386
00:32:58,297 --> 00:33:00,198
When?

387
00:33:00,232 --> 00:33:03,670
Soon.

388
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:07,472
It'll be a blood bath.

389
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:14,280
I don't care what happens
to anyone here... but Ruth.

390
00:33:14,314 --> 00:33:16,415
No offense taken.

391
00:33:18,317 --> 00:33:20,653
You've changed,
Mr. Bohannon.

392
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:24,692
Yeah? I'd say it's you.
Take me out there.

393
00:33:27,997 --> 00:33:31,533
If they catch us...
They'll kill you.

394
00:33:32,936 --> 00:33:35,703
Take me out there right now.

395
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,362
You wanted to see me?

396
00:34:05,907 --> 00:34:08,174
It's your take from the saloon.

397
00:34:09,443 --> 00:34:11,242
You were holding out on me.

398
00:34:11,277 --> 00:34:12,543
That's for your own good.

399
00:34:12,577 --> 00:34:15,309
Against the church...
Woman.

400
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,181
Word is you've separated from her, yeah?

401
00:34:19,216 --> 00:34:21,884
Actually, we're closer than ever.

402
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,784
She'll never convert to the faith.

403
00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:26,086
I'm going to convert to hers.

404
00:34:27,187 --> 00:34:29,721
Would you listen to yourself?

405
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:31,822
She's infected your mind.

406
00:34:31,856 --> 00:34:33,490
I thought it through.

407
00:34:33,524 --> 00:34:35,059
That'd kill mum.

408
00:34:35,093 --> 00:34:37,429
You'll burn in hell, Sean.

409
00:34:37,464 --> 00:34:40,828
You're forever cast in the lake of fire.

410
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:42,296
Children's catechism.

411
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,265
It's in the Bible.

412
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,699
I came to America to build

413
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:50,301
a life in this world, not the next.

414
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:54,642
Then I'll have to disown you.

415
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:01,280
Whew.

416
00:35:02,985 --> 00:35:05,421
Do you know who I am?

417
00:35:07,254 --> 00:35:09,288
Your Elam's friend.

418
00:35:09,322 --> 00:35:10,825
I'm his brother.

419
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,127
I'd be that baby's Uncle.

420
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:17,260
I appreciate your thoughts,

421
00:35:17,295 --> 00:35:20,227
but I'm Mrs. Toole
and this is his baby.

422
00:35:20,262 --> 00:35:22,030
If that how you see it,

423
00:35:22,065 --> 00:35:23,901
then you need to talk to Elam,

424
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:26,340
'cause his heart is tearing all apart.

425
00:35:47,297 --> 00:35:50,197
It isn't time for the gathering of tribes.

426
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:51,935
A blood moon is coming.

427
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,836
What's a blood moon?

428
00:35:53,871 --> 00:35:57,139
It's a time for bloodletting...

429
00:35:57,173 --> 00:35:58,874
The settling of scores.

430
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,177
Between who?
The tribes?

431
00:36:01,211 --> 00:36:03,880
They will come against you.

432
00:36:09,822 --> 00:36:11,922
[Yelling in background]

433
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:23,828
I want you to come and tell Durant,

434
00:36:23,863 --> 00:36:26,630
so he don't think I'm crazy.

435
00:36:28,031 --> 00:36:31,369
You'll never see me again.

436
00:36:36,876 --> 00:36:41,310
What did you do after you
discovered the Sioux threat?

437
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,583
Telegraphed the fort
and asked for soldiers.

438
00:36:47,617 --> 00:36:49,916
We sent men and weapons.

439
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:54,685
Yeah, five recruits and a small cannon.
Much obliged.

440
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:06,867
Baptism is a sacramental
cleansing of a life.

441
00:37:06,902 --> 00:37:09,036
Do you understand that?

442
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,905
Of course.

443
00:37:19,214 --> 00:37:24,285
You affirm your love
of God above all things.

444
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:27,016
All people.

445
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:30,450
God should be so lucky.

446
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:34,650
This is serious, Sean.

447
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:38,184
You're going to have to
renounce your faith.

448
00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:44,720
You're going to have
to give up your saloon,

449
00:37:44,755 --> 00:37:47,158
the pleasure house...
And?

450
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:48,792
And...

451
00:37:49,826 --> 00:37:54,364
I just can't believe
you're going to do that.

452
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:58,303
Doesn't your church compel you

453
00:37:58,337 --> 00:38:00,603
to baptize anyone who asks?

454
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:06,107
If you are sincere, Sean.

455
00:38:06,141 --> 00:38:10,073
Does your God allow you
to deny me access to him?

456
00:38:12,478 --> 00:38:14,713
Of course not.

457
00:38:14,747 --> 00:38:16,147
Well...

458
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,960
To the river then.

459
00:39:07,981 --> 00:39:09,949
Is it that ugly?

460
00:39:11,284 --> 00:39:14,886
No... it's beautiful.

461
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:18,026
I knew you'd come around once you saw it...

462
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,961
And saw that I was serious.

463
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:24,295
I'm married, Elam.

464
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:26,830
Don't matter out here.

465
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,507
No...
My husband is, um...

466
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:39,677
He's... he's a good
provider, and, uh...

467
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,882
He's gonna be a good father.

468
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,320
Me, too.

469
00:39:46,355 --> 00:39:47,721
No.

470
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:49,788
Think about it.

471
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:54,028
No, um...

472
00:39:56,832 --> 00:40:01,636
I'll always love you, Elam, but I...

473
00:40:01,671 --> 00:40:04,707
My future is
with Mr. Toole.

474
00:40:06,677 --> 00:40:08,746
You know you don't want that.

475
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,483
It doesn't matter what I want.

476
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:13,753
It's what's best.

477
00:40:16,656 --> 00:40:18,022
Good-bye.

479
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:22,762
Oh, no.

480
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:30,772
I looked all over for ya,

481
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:32,908
prayed to God and Christ you weren't here,

482
00:40:32,942 --> 00:40:36,009
but here you are.

483
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,845
It's not... it's not
what you think.

484
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,814
Steady, Mr. Ferguson!

485
00:40:45,385 --> 00:40:48,189
I thought we were on our way.

486
00:40:49,192 --> 00:40:50,393
We are.

487
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:51,964
God spared me once,

488
00:40:51,998 --> 00:40:56,435
for what...
I thought it was you.

489
00:40:56,469 --> 00:40:59,103
Now I see God is a malicious bastard,

490
00:40:59,137 --> 00:41:01,871
a streak of cruelty as wide as the sky.

491
00:41:01,906 --> 00:41:05,607
No. I came to tell him that it's
over between us, I swear it.

492
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:07,161
I love you, Eva, and you made me think

493
00:41:07,162 --> 00:41:10,278
that you loved me
just a little bit, as well.

494
00:41:10,313 --> 00:41:11,912
I do.

495
00:41:11,947 --> 00:41:14,515
Your heart is for
this black son of a bitch!

496
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,286
Don't, please.

497
00:41:19,422 --> 00:41:21,857
Please.

498
00:41:24,863 --> 00:41:27,165
Forgive me, father.

499
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:36,012
Aah!

501
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:25,153
I'm so sorry.

502
00:42:25,187 --> 00:42:27,261
Thank you.

503

[Coins dropping]

504
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:37,868
Do you renounce the spiritual
forces of wickedness,

505
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:41,204
reject the evil powers of this world,

506
00:42:41,238 --> 00:42:43,805
and repent of your sin?

507
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,910
I do.

508
00:42:46,944 --> 00:42:49,682
Do you accept the freedom and power

509
00:42:49,716 --> 00:42:53,051
God gives you to resist evil

510
00:42:53,085 --> 00:42:56,992
and oppression in whatever
forms they present themselves?

511
00:42:57,027 --> 00:42:59,397
I do.

512
00:43:00,499 --> 00:43:04,068
Do you confess Jesus Christ as your savior

513
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:08,941
and promise to serve him as your lord?

514
00:43:08,975 --> 00:43:11,211
I do.

515
00:43:11,245 --> 00:43:13,181
Wherever
Mr. Gregory Toole is...

516
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:17,216
I'm sure he wishes he hadn't...

517
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,750
He hadn't done what he did.

518
00:43:21,386 --> 00:43:26,186
It's the nature of this place, isn't it?

519

Goes and makes ya do things
that can't be undone.

520
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:38,266
He gave every man a square deal,

521
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,269
he always bought us a fair share of rounds.

522
00:43:42,304 --> 00:43:46,104
He liked to drink...

523
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,476
He loved his wife.

servant into your heart.

Brother Sean... your sins
are washed away.

I thought the lord was going to
send the angel Gabriel himself

Good day, Mr. Durant.

539
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:50,988

an agreement, Mr. Ferguson.

540

This job you need doing...

Cold feet, hmm?

542
00:45:56,591 --> 00:45:58,691
I would've thought...

543
00:45:58,726 --> 00:46:05,163
That you would want to keep your
land, your house, your future...

544
00:46:05,197 --> 00:46:07,730
You said after the bridge...

545

It's time, Mr. Ferguson.

547
00:46:20,204 --> 00:46:22,902
Good boy. Good boy.

"I received your request

"Though I wish I could accommodate
all similar requests,

unless your scout can provide
better intelligence..."

"I'm afraid we can't
accommodate you at this time."

555
00:46:54,821 --> 00:46:57,488
This is some kind of bullshit.

00:46:57,522 --> 00:46:59,658
This is the world we live in.

557
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:02,898
We cannot panic every time
somebody sees an Indian

558
00:47:02,932 --> 00:47:04,801
and bring the work to a halt.

559
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:06,715
Well, guess what? The
men are already spooked.

560
00:47:06,716 --> 00:47:09,038
Damn it!
Thomas...

561
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:12,840

Mr. Ferguson.

566
00:47:38,638 --> 00:47:41,840
Sit down.

567
00:47:47,481 --> 00:47:50,949
Did you change your mind about sending it?

568
00:47:50,983 --> 00:47:54,215

Mr. Durant have it his way,

I'm gonna be shipping it in the morning.

571

You're here to kill me.

572
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:12,939
Mr. Durant
promised me my land

573
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,073
and my house down on the river.

574
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:26,689
My life is worth only a few
acres of river bottom.

575
00:48:26,724 --> 00:48:28,924
It's a nice spot.

576
00:48:31,594 --> 00:48:33,895
How are you going to do it?

577
00:48:33,929 --> 00:48:36,396
Strangle or cut.

578
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:41,062
Probably cut.

579
00:48:56,846 --> 00:48:59,579
You got a reason for me not to?

580
00:49:00,681 --> 00:49:02,115
I don't think you're the person

581

the Durants think you are.

582
00:49:03,886 --> 00:49:06,720
I done my share of killing.

00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:10,690
Not like this.

Mr. Bohannon and I will be
his natural replacements.

How the Durants arrested?

Once that package reaches its destination,

there'll be a warrant
issued for Mr. Durant.

For you, a permanent position
of respect on this railroad.

came to see me last night.

Ah.

601
00:51:20,752 --> 00:51:25,524
Well, you had your chance, Lily.

602
00:51:25,558 --> 00:51:28,730
We asked you to leave town nicely.

603
00:51:32,234 --> 00:51:34,903
I told you already, Thomas.

604
00:51:34,938 --> 00:51:36,741
I won't be pushed out.

[Chuckles]

606
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:43,316
You betrayed me to Bohannon
over pillow talk.

607
00:51:43,351 --> 00:51:47,720
So you decided to have me killed.

608
00:51:47,754 --> 00:51:49,756
It's vulgar, Thomas.

00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,091

I have borne every privation
for this railroad!

another human being,

the hands of your wife...

615
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:06,245
I've even endured your bed!

616
00:52:06,279 --> 00:52:10,617
That, Lily, makes you a whore.

617
00:52:12,053 --> 00:52:15,656
[Sighs] Know then that
when your precious railroad

618
00:52:15,691 --> 00:52:18,025
is ripped from your thick
and grasping fingers

619
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:19,827
that you've been undone by a whore.

620
00:52:19,861 --> 00:52:21,696
Why?

621
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,267
What have you done?

622
00:52:26,503 --> 00:52:30,670
I'll leave you to your work.

When I try to convince them

624
00:52:37,278 --> 00:52:41,448
I was their white spirit...

625
00:52:41,482 --> 00:52:44,957
They stretched me on the ground

626
00:52:44,991 --> 00:52:50,059
and they built small fires upon my body.

No!

I should never have turned
to the... the heathens.

632

You should never have lost
your place in this town.

I have...
I have missed you...

Seeing you by your husband's side.

635
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:20,556
Shh.

636
00:53:20,591 --> 00:53:22,057
I'm here now.

637
00:53:22,091 --> 00:53:25,994
[Muttering] You must leave this place.

638
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:28,531
[Cocks gun] Wait!

639
00:53:28,566 --> 00:53:31,068
Why? Why must I leave, Mr. Gunderson?

Yeah. When's
that going to be?

643
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:45,986
Tomorrow night.

644
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:48,555
Oh, God!

645
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:00,667
There's no need for
that, Mr. Bohannon.

646
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:02,269
Look at him.

647
00:54:02,303 --> 00:54:04,463
I doubt he's even going to
make it through the night.

648
00:54:04,464 --> 00:54:06,237
Friend of yours or not,

649
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:08,339
he's going to hang for
sabotaging the railroad.

650
00:54:08,374 --> 00:54:09,908
I'm putting a guard on him.

651

Hey, you!

654
00:54:29,794 --> 00:54:31,664
Stop! This is not the way.

655
00:54:31,698 --> 00:54:33,018
Son of a bitch tried to kill you?

656
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,166
Stop!

657
00:54:34,201 --> 00:54:35,833
Stop!

658
00:54:35,868 --> 00:54:37,836
You will not kill another man in a rage,

659
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:39,705
I won't have Durant's blood on my hands.

660
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:41,099
Then why the hell did you tell me?

661
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,372
To prove to you finally that he has to go.

662
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:47,713
But not this way.

663
00:54:47,747 --> 00:54:50,847
You and I can build this railroad together.

664
00:54:50,882 --> 00:54:53,685
I've already shipped the ledger.

665
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:56,421
But the board won't take a woman seriously.

666
00:54:56,455 --> 00:54:58,790
I can't do this without you.

667
00:55:03,227 --> 00:55:06,629
And you...

668
00:55:07,931 --> 00:55:13,401
You're better with me, aren't you?

669
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:17,201
Yeah.

670
00:55:18,403 --> 00:55:20,705
I am.

671
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:27,446
I want you on the first
railcar out of here.

672
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,580
You ain't gonna be on it, is you?

673
00:55:29,614 --> 00:55:30,950
No.

674
00:55:30,984 --> 00:55:33,116
Thought so.

675
00:55:35,084 --> 00:55:36,882
Protect our bridge.

676
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:41,089
I'll be here waiting for
you when you get back.

677
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:07,181
You know how to work a Cannon?

678
00:56:07,215 --> 00:56:09,285
Cannon?

679
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:11,721
I seen plenty Cannon work.

680
00:56:11,756 --> 00:56:14,591
You really got one?

681
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:17,896
Mount up, this ain't no place to die.

682
00:56:25,405 --> 00:56:27,840
Thanks for not killin' my lady friend.

683
00:56:27,874 --> 00:56:29,508
You welcome.

684
00:56:29,543 --> 00:56:31,377
Gotta ask you though.

685
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:33,947
Was you ever gonna do it?

686
00:56:33,981 --> 00:56:36,249
You know your Bible?

687
00:56:36,284 --> 00:56:39,184
Some.

688
00:56:39,218 --> 00:56:41,317
You know when the angel came down,

689
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:45,420
grab a hold of Abraham's arm right
before he cut Isaac's neck?

690
00:56:45,454 --> 00:56:46,788
Yeah?

691
00:56:46,822 --> 00:56:48,657
It won't like that.

692
00:56:48,692 --> 00:56:52,394
Almost got my ass shot.

693
00:56:53,729 --> 00:56:56,863
She ain't a woman to be messed with.

694
00:56:56,898 --> 00:56:58,565
True.

695
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:00,032
True, she ain't.

696
00:57:00,066 --> 00:57:02,601
Hmm. Let's do it.

697
00:57:02,636 --> 00:57:04,736
[Clicking]

698
00:57:04,771 --> 00:57:05,756
Ahh.

699
00:57:26,817 --> 00:57:30,286
If I could have a quiet word, please.

[Gasping]

701
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:59,123
My personal ledgers...
How damning are they?

702
00:57:59,157 --> 00:58:05,466
You ask because you have lost them, hmm?

703
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,069
How damning?

704
00:58:08,103 --> 00:58:13,611
How far you are falling, min herrdome.

705
00:58:13,646 --> 00:58:21,250
You may fall through
the floor into hell itself.

706
00:58:21,284 --> 00:58:23,318
[Gasping]

707
00:58:23,353 --> 00:58:30,128
At least a prison in upstate New York.

708
00:58:30,163 --> 00:58:33,866
What am I going to do?

709
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:40,332
You are suffering...
That is good!

710
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:44,738
Suffering builds character.

711
00:58:44,773 --> 00:58:50,109
You will need that during
your incarceration.

712
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:51,478
I will die in prison.

713
00:58:51,513 --> 00:58:56,949
[Gasping] That is not true.

714
00:58:56,984 --> 00:59:00,722
Come... come.

715
00:59:00,756 --> 00:59:03,324
The truth is...

716
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:07,961
You will not die in prison but here.

717
00:59:07,995 --> 00:59:14,867
Soon, in the streets of hell on wheels...

718
00:59:14,901 --> 00:59:16,101

719
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:21,845
Come. Let me
kiss you farewell.

720
00:59:21,879 --> 00:59:24,448
Get your filthy hands off me!

[Gasping]

723
00:59:35,799 --> 00:59:39,470
Was Durant aware of the impending attack?

724
00:59:39,504 --> 00:59:45,111
We did what we could...

725
00:59:45,146 --> 00:59:48,083
Evacuated the women and
children, and we armed the rest.

726
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:50,086
Did Mr. Durant
attempt to flee?

727
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,958
At least not with the women and children.

728
00:59:52,992 --> 00:59:54,227

I learned in the war
to protect strategic assets.

918
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:00,922
The town.

919
01:16:00,957 --> 01:16:03,490
The town ain't nothing but
wood and canvas, replaceable.

920
01:16:03,524 --> 01:16:06,294
And its inhabitants?

921
01:16:08,766 --> 01:16:10,901

Ah. A beautiful
bridge, Mr. Bohannon.

956
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:26,787
An enduring monument to the vision of Mrs.
Lily Bell...

957
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:33,494
And your own myopic
single-mindedness.

958
01:20:33,842 --> 01:20:35,207
[chuckles]

959
01:20:35,327 --> 01:20:38,520
I was surprised that you made it

960
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:40,692
so easy

961
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,552
to take her from you.

962
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:47,703
Thank you.

01:20:48,447 --> 01:20:49,886
It was, uh...

01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:53,063
inexplicably pleasurable...

965
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:01,925
Not as much as it'll be to see you swing.

966
01:21:03,688 --> 01:21:05,003
You evil son of a bitch.

967
01:21:05,338 --> 01:21:08,093

Adieu to you!

Good day!
