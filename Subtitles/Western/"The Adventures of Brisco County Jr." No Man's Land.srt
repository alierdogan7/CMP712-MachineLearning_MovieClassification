1
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,968
- Need a hand?
- Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,705
Daddy, I want my dolly.

3
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,439
Emily, we'll find your dolly; just wait.

4
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,210
What happened?

5
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,582
Three men rode through
here a couple of hours ago.

6
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,951
They looted the town and went on a rampage.

7
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,182
That sounds familiar.

8
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:00,055
- Why is that mister?
- Describe 'em.

9
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,617
They weren't from around here, that's for sure.

10
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:07,029
One of them was big and mean.
The other one was nervous and crazy.

11
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,769
And the third one was a 
long haired son-of-a-buck.

12
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:14,603
- They driving an old wagon?
- That's right, full of loot.

13
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,073
- You know 'em?
- Yeah,

14
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:19,043
been chasing them since they burned 
down an orphanage in Heiler Ben.

15
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,637
They hit four other towns
between here and there.

16
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,715
Then who are they?

17
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,218
Phil, Will and Bill. The Swill brothers.

18
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,054
A good reason why inbreeding is a bad idea.

19
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:34,782
I don't see a badge.
You must be a bounty hunter.

20
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,088
Yeah I am.

21
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:40,690
- These boys got a big price on their heads?
- No, we got a history.

22
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,997
<i>Look out, it's gonna blow!</i>

23
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,201
Emily!

24
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,400
There you are. You're all dirty.

25
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,900
No. Don't. You wait here.

26
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,858
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- I know what you mean.

27
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:41,310
Well Comet, I'd say by these tracks 
that we're only an hour or two behind.



28
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,622
Give or take an hour.

29
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,928
No, I have no idea why 
they turned off the main road.

30
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,362
There's nothing out there for 100 miles.

31
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,406
Bowler! Come in, please, sit down.

32
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,215
- May I get you something?
- Yeah: an explanation.

33
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,254
You're being nice just coz you want somethin'.

34
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,721
- What is it?
- We've got a job for you.

35
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,916
What about Brisco?

36
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,859
I thought he was the official 
Westerfield Club bounty hunter.

37
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:26,365
Brisco's on the trail of Swill brothers.
They hit three of our banks.

38
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:31,059
- Who are you looking for?
- It's not a person. It's an object.

39
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:36,141
And if you recover it, we'll pay you $2000.

40
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,801
Now you're talking. What is it?

41
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,410
It's a classified government secret.

42
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,609
If I tell you,

43
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,585
you must swear never to reveal its existance.

44
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,679
For $2,000, I'll find it.

45
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,681
For $3000, I'll promise not to talk about it.

46
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:58,323
- Alright, $3000.
- Well, let me see it!

47
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,434
What the heck is it?

48
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,366
My employers developed
this vehicle for the army.

49
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,934
It has a tread drive system

50
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,913
that allows it to roll unhindered 
across nearly any terrain.

51
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:20,942
It's armed with a 70mm cannon
of enourmous destructive capabilties

52
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,251
and is protected by 8 inches of steel.

53
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:31,830
Bowler, this mobile battle-wagon
can roll through a bank,

54
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:35,334
the White House
or an entire cavalry division!

55
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,859
There is not a weapon yet invented
that can stop it!

56
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,270
- Then how am I supposed to?
- You can't.

57
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,866
Then what in Sam Hill am I doing here?

58
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:48,141
You can't stop the machine,
but you can stop the driver.

59
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,982
He has to come out eventually.

60
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,419
You want me to track a 
doomsday machine 500 miles,

61
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,148
risking my life and limb,

62
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:01,853
hoping I get lucky and grab the driver
before he takes over the country?

63
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,089
For a measly $3000?

64
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,228
Yes.

65
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,930
You got a deal.

66
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,841
What is it, boy?

67
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,248
Yeah, I hear it too.

68
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,547
Sounds like that wagon is just up ahead.

69
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,623
- Who did the cooking last night?
- Me, I did.

70
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,036
- You bubbling again Will?
- Like a sulpher geyser!

71
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,598
Get me the catalog.
What the hell was it you fixed, Phil?

72
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,907
- Bill found it in the road.
- You're not the cook no more, Phil!

73
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,575
Yes sir, Will.
Thank you for the opportunity.

74
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,356
It might take a while.

75
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,888
Keep an eye out for Gill.

76
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,299
- What did I cook last night?
- Wasn't it a rabbit?

77
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,743
Hard to tell. It was so mangled.

78
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,009
Will ain't going to like you 
messing with his looking glass.

79
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,711
I ain't messing with it.
I'm looking for Gill.

80
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,380
I wonder what Gill's got 
planned that's so important.

81
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,823
It must be pretty big to drag us 
all the way back to our old hideout.

82
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,360
It'll be good to get back to 
that ghost town, huh Bill?

83
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,895
Be able to relax.

84
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,796
Wouldn't have to look over our shoulders.

85
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,766
Well, Phil, I have to admit

86
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:52,134
I kinda enjoyed the past
eight months on the road.

87
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:56,535
The random violence,
and the occasional killing.

88
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,708
And the sudden surprises?

89
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,441
Alright, get your hands up 
and get down off that wagon.

90
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,450
You too. Hands up.

91
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,850
Alright, pull your pants up first,
then get your hands up.

92
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,792
Well, well, well. The Swill brothers.

93
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,967
- Do we know you?
- We've met.

94
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,160
How's that?

95
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,830
I got a bullet in the shoulder
compliments of you boys.

96
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,237
- Who are you?
- Brisco County Junior.

97
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,970
- The son of the famous marshall?
- That's right, Bill.

98
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,137
I'm, Bill. He's Phil.

99
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,008
So I guess that makes you Will.

100
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,016
Looks like the three Swill brothers' 
little Reign of Terror has ended.

101
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,080
- Gill!
- Gill!

102
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,213
Gill?

103
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,071
Hold your fire.

104
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:15,545
How did one lousy tinhorn 
get the drop on all three of you?

105
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,784
Good thing he didn't know 
there were five of us.

106
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,425
There's four of us, Bill.

107
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,757
- Get down there and get him!
- Hold it!

108
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,524
It's Brisco County Junior. 
We gotta make sure we got him.

109
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,158
Forget about him. His horse ran off.

110
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,761
There's nothing out here but dirt and sun,
he's a goner.

111
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,399
Besides, we've got better things to do.

112
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,068
- Is that so?
- That's so.

113
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,511
So, Gill, it's good to see you again.
Whatcha got cookin'?

114
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,245
Moving into the big time.

115
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,447
- How's that?
- You remember our cousin Ed?

116
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,285
The one who married Aunt Miriam?

117
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:54,258
- I thought he married his mother.
- That's what I said.

118
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,189
Until recently, Ed was one
of the army's top test drivers.

119
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,458
The man is fearless.

120
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,796
You have to be fearless to marry your mother.

121
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,425
Get to the point.

122
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,369
Ed was chosen to test
the army's latest weapon.

123
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,671
A machine that every general in the 
world would give his eye teeth for.

124
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,811
Our cousin, Ed, borrowed it.

125
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,341
By the time the sun goes down boys,

126
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,747
we will have in our possession
a mobile battle-wagon.

127
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,353
Now, let's get on into town.

128
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,127
I'm with you Comet.

129
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,234
I just need to get my bearings.

130
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,739
But ... It was ...

131
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,173
Comet?

132
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,878
Brisco.

133
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,593
Thanks for stopping by professor.

134
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,369
That little thing?

135
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,041
This is going to be the 
easiest $3000 I ever made.

136
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,381
Damn!

137
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:19,255
Sounds like the Swills
gave you quite a time back there.

138
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,194
It's a good thing I wasn't the 3:10 to Uma.

139
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,368
Where are we going?

140
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:27,004
Whoa!
Halt!

141
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,870
Hold on there, son.

142
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,809
You took quite a knock 
on the noggin back there.

143
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:37,042
Now, let's see. Hopefully there's a
doctor in the town just up the road here.

144
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,880
- There is no town.
- There is on my map.

145
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,580
You got to have a map like 
that when you're on tour.

146
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,520
That's what I'm doing, Brisco.

147
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,684
Traveling the country,
showing off my invention.

148
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,218
Yep, living off what I earn.
Five cents a ride, it adds up, you know?

149
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,696
Yeah, right.

150
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,530
Now that my fourth wife has left me,
I've given up women all together!

151
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,539
Nothing to hold me back. No regrets.

152
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,307
It's just going to be
Professor Albert Wickwire

153
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,640
and his amazing rocket car!

154
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,879
"No Man's Land."

155
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,753
Interesting.

156
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,992
Well there's something you don't see every day.

157
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,828
Excuse me, ladies.

158
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,132
Can you tell me where I might find a doctor?

159
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,679
I knew I should've learnt German.

160
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,976
Can anybody help me?

161
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,678
I need a doctor for my friend here!

162
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,787
Hold it.

163
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,024
- Are you the doctor?
- No.

164
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,165
But I am in charge of greeting 
new visitors such as yourself.

165
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,227
Didn't you see the sign back there?

166
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,267
Oh! The that said:
"No Man's Land, Keep Out?"

167
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,831
That's right.

168
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,671
No Man's Land?

169
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,739
No... MANS... land...

170
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,216
Oh, my God.

171
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,617
I get it.

172
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,351
No men.

173
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,189
There are no men in this entire town, right?

174
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,525
Get over it and turn around.

175
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,530
You're not welcome here.

176
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,066
What's going on?

177
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,694
Visitor's on the way out.

178
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,864
Sheriff, please.

179
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,964
My friend's hurt his head.

180
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:46,102
He needs a doctor. That's all we want.

181
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,325
Go get the doctor, Casey.
Tell her to meet me at my house.

182
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,765
- You gonna take him in?
- He's hurt, Casey.

183
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,629
Get the doc.

184
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,344
We got an ordinance - no guns in town.

185
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,985
What's this guy's name?

186
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,917
Brisco County Junior.

187
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,443
Brisco. Welcome back.

188
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,848
I gotta get going.

189
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,942
Oh, sorry, Brisco.
You're not going anywhere at the moment.

190
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,686
Where am I?

191
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,316
Well, I've got some pretty 
good news for you on that front.

192
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,155
- What?
- While you were unconscious,

193
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,092
I did a little investigating on my own.

194
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:14,599
You and I are the only 
two men in this entire town.

195
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,236
Ah, you're awake.

196
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,501
Let me check.

197
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,676
Did I miss something?

198
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,943
Five stitches and a little clean-up.

199
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:36,647
- Brisco, meet Jenny Taylor, the sheriff.
- I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

200
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,850
- If you need anything, I'll be downstairs.
- Thank you.

201
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,986
And, Doctor. Sorry. 
I don't remember your name.

202
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,624
- Dr. Quintana, Medicine Woman.
- Right!

203
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,061
So, how's our boy doing, doctor?

204
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,627
<i> Bene, as long as he stays flat on his back.</i>

205
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,366
Not a bad suggestion, 
considering where we are.

206
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:02,867
<i>Si, molto bene.</i>

207
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,440
All you need now is lots of rest.

208
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,417
Well, you don't need me hanging around then.

209
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,317
- Oh, professor?
- Yes?

210
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,285
- Thanks for stopping and helping.
- Oh sure.

211
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,622
- Good luck with your tour.
- Don't be ridiculous Brisco,

212
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,251
I'm not leaving town.

213
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,661
I'm going to stick it out with you, 
as long as it takes.

214
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,096
Then where you going now?

215
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,033
I've been invited to the home of 
the Schwenke sisters

216
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,395
they're tremendous blacksmiths.

217
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,573
And they're very curious about my rocket.

218
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,110
I thought you'd sworn off women?

219
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,308
A man must adapt Brisco.
It's a law of nature.

220
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,012
Adapt or perish.

221
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,189
Variables change. Flux is inevitable.

222
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,818
And I, for one, enjoy flux.

223
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,026
- Pace yourself.
- What?

224
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,800
Oh, yeah. I will.

225
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,431
Doctor.

226
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:07,278
You said it was a ghost town.
You said no-one was going to be here.

227
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,410
- What's going on Will?
- How should I know?

228
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:31,266
- There are people living here.
- So let's relocate them to a six foot hole.

229
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,635
No, let's just take it one step at a time.

230
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,941
I didn't even know there was a town out here.

231
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,008
- And that's the way we like it.
- It used to be a mining town.

232
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:51,385
The silver, she dry up, as the river.
It became a ghost town.

233
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:56,151
Four women heading west found the town. 
They decided to stay and fix it up.

234
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,923
Other women followed.

235
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:02,023
It didn't take long to realize a town 
for women only was a good idea.

236
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,030
I am medicine woman.

237
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,196
But you think I can get a job anywhere else?

238
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,734
It's a man's world out there.

239
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,576
That's about to change.
We're entering a new era.

240
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,478
Tell that to some of the women
who had to drag themselves here.

241
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:21,076
Women here have a chance, and all the jobs.

242
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,348
So what about you?
How'd you end up here?

243
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,230
We all have our reasons.

244
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,535
This is our town! 
What hell are you doing in it?

245
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:41,061
- Tryin' to make an honest livin'!
- Try somewhere else!

246
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,017
Will, you chased every woman outta here,
didn't ya?

247
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,456
Yeah I did.

248
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:09,026
You find out how well armed they are?
Who's in charge?

249
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,705
- How spread out they are?
- They're only women. Who cares?

250
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:16,969
I do.

251
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:20,372
I was running the gang just fine 
while you were off gallivanting.

252
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,676
Gallivanting? Can you spell the word, Will?

253
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,741
Do you know what it means?

254
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,308
Because if you do and you think 
that's what I've been doing,

255
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:31,618
you're even a dumber little
pimple than I thought you were.

256
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,091
Why don't you ask
Phil and Bill and see what they think?

257
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,695
Can't we all just get along?

258
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,398
- What are you doing?
- I can't stay on my back forever.

259
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,532
I wouldn't be rushing it if I were you.

260
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:54,101
Look, I don't know how you feel,

261
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,810
but I'm a lot more comfortable
if I have my gun.

262
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:01,114
And we'd all feel a lot better around 
here if it stayed locked up in my office.

263
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,815
A city ordinance, huh?

264
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,920
You must think we're all crazy 
being out here, don't ya?

265
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,265
No, actually I think what 
you're doing is pretty amazing.

266
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,001
It's a good place to live, Brisco.

267
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,969
No, it's a lot more than that.

268
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,534
It's a group of people trying to make 
a better place for themselves.

269
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,507
There's nothing crazy about that.

270
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,944
You gotta keep trying new things, 
looking over that horizon.

271
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,472
You know there's a whole new era coming?

272
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,479
What are you looking for?

273
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,988
I don't know. But it's out there.

274
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,525
And I'm going to find it.

275
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,789
You really belive that, don't you?

276
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,427
Yes, I do.

277
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,894
What is it, Casey?

278
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,634
Four men just threw me out of my own saloon.

279
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,801
Alright, we'll take care of it.

280
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,411
- So, when's Ed supposed to get here?
- Anytime.

281
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,181
And you're all going to have to lay low 
and behave yourselves until he does.

282
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,879
Excuse me, gentlemen.

283
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,321
Who are you calling a "gentlemen"?

284
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,329
Show a little respect.
That there is the sheriff, Will.

285
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,490
That's right, I am.

286
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,925
And we've got an ordinance in this town boys -

287
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,630
no guns.

288
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,432
No-gun ordinance, huh?

289
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,476
Well, I guess we just better do 
what the lady says.

290
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,958
The truth is, 
we were never much for ordinances.

291
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:03,267
Alright now, move. Guns on the bar, ladies.

292
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,771
Let's go!

293
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,083
That's right.

294
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:22,991
Up against the bar and keep
those hands where I can see 'em.

295
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,772
- So what are we gonna do with 'em?
- I would say anything we want.

296
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,912
Check it out.

297
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,242
There ain't nothing out here.

298
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:26,690
What if one of the locals decides to 
ride out and get the Federal Marshal?

299
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,851
Come on Will, be serious.

300
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,222
You think I'm worried about a miserable Federal Marshal?

301
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,994
- Seems like you should be worried Gill.
- Well I'm not.

302
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,928
Hand me the key.

303
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:42,398
All we need is that wagon, 
and nothing can hurt us.

304
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,767
I hope you know what you're doing, Gill.

305
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,245
Little brother, you worry too much.

306
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,282
Let me pour you a drink.

307
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,694
What we have here?

308
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,106
There's somebody down there!

309
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,455
Let's go!

310
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:22,371
- A town of all women?
- That's Brisco County Junior.

311
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,042
Every gun in town is locked up in that vault?

312
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,205
Yeah, that's what I said.

313
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,542
You've got a spare key, right?

314
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,550
I know a gun free town must seem 
awfully strange to your male ego,

315
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,984
but you'd be surprised how it 
cuts down on bullet wounds.

316
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,783
Good point.

317
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,080
He's unarmed. Why should we worry about him?

318
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:44,094
He's Brisco County Junior, you idiot!
He's smart and he's got guts.

319
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,687
- Find him.
- What the hell's that?

320
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,728
Spread out. Find County.

321
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,364
I'll take care of this.

322
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,138
Hold on there, stranger.

323
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:03,109
- You the sheriff?
- That's what this badge means.

324
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,945
Well sheriff, you got 
a heap of trouble headed your way.

325
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:09,680
- Is that right? What is it?
- Well, I can't tell you.

326
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:14,316
- I thought this place was a ghost town.
- Well, not anymore.

327
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:18,453
You look kinda parched.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

328
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:50,087
You make it sould like the devil 
himself is coming this way.

329
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,423
Might be.

330
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,623
Oh, jeez. Any idea why?

331
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,792
I'm just supposed to find it
and bring it back.

332
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,796
- You got a plan, have ya?
- I'm workin' on one.

333
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,633
All by yourself?

334
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:07,244
- You offering to help?
- Help? No. No.

335
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:11,571
Just seems that one man trying to 
stop three tons of steel might be tough.

336
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:15,085
I don't think I said how much it weighed.

337
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,049
You didn't say it had a 70mm cannon

338
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,024
or tread-track system either, did ya?

339
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,720
No, I don't think I did.

340
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:28,558
Your secret's safe with me.
For a long, long time.

341
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:42,746
Now little lady, I'm here just like 
you to take a nice little hot bath.

342
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,348
If you get any closer and I'll scream.

343
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,217
I like screaming.

344
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:53,857
Don't you worry.
I'll be nice and gentle.

345
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:07,463
- Thanks for your help.
- Happy to oblige.

346
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,269
- Can you handle him?
- I've tied a few knots before.

347
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,276
Hey!

348
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,589
One of them is right behind me. Are we all set?

349
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,561
Almost. Another two meters higher, girls.

350
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,571
Brisco, I'd like you to meet 
the Schwenke sisters.

351
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,130
- Katrina and llsa.
- A pleasure.

352
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,540
I knew I shoulda learned German.

353
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:56,452
- Here he comes.
- Hurry, right this way. Up there, quickly!

354
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,028
You might as well come out,

355
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,502
or I'll just start shooting random-like.

356
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,634
- Now?
- No no no no. He's got to get further in.

357
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,511
I hope you weren't hiding in that hay.

358
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,516
Olly olly oxen free.

359
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,793
- Now?
- Come out, come out, wherever you are.

360
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:43,027
Maybe I'll just have to shoot
your little horsey.

361
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:48,133
- All right, Phil, you got me.
- Come on down from there.

362
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,370
- Now?
- Now!

363
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,673
Well, that seemed to work out quite well.

364
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,844
Yeah, but there's still two of them out there.

365
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,787
I'm thinking of something
that could be quite effective.

366
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:08,883
I need some fishing line,
coat hangers, soap and some cheese.

367
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,723
- Cheese?
- I'm hungry.

368
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,091
The hangers are upstairs.

369
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,565
Professor, you can help me
get the rest of the stuff, okay?

370
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,896
Right-o!

371
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,721
What's taking so long?

372
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,088
What?

373
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,827
I don't know why I 
just didn't burn all this.

374
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:57,202
- Happy memories as John Bly's moll?
- No!

375
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,677
You just wouldn't understand.

376
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,408
John Bly and his gang killed my father.

377
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:07,211
That's all I need to understand.

378
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:21,529
You have every right to hate
anybody connected with John Bly.

379
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,965
I don't hate them,
but I'm gonna bring them all in.

380
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,502
When this is over, you're coming with me.

381
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,540
That's not what your father wanted.

382
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,239
When he caught up with Bly,

383
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,941
I was expecting to be hauled in with the lot.

384
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,681
But your dad just looked at me.

385
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,215
I don't know what it was that he saw.

386
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,050
He told me to run,

387
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:50,424
to get as far away from 
what I'd become as possible.

388
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,258
So I ended up here.

389
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,199
They needed a sheriff 
and I needed a second chance.

390
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,403
One thing my father taught me was that

391
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,133
second chances are hard to come by.

392
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,870
I know. I'm trying hard.

393
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,480
- You know where Bly is?
- No.

394
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:17,177
- Yeah, well, if you see him ...
- You'll be the first to know.

395
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,393
We're two storeys up.

396
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,601
Oh, come on Brisco - 
this is the oldest trick in the book!

397
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,437
Yeah, I know it is.

398
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,656
You think I'm stupid?

399
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,438
Why would I think that you're stupid?

400
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,317
You're a key player, Will.

401
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,756
- Bowler?
- Brisco?

402
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,265
- Drop the guns.
- Don't do it!

403
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,207
We got your brothers, Gill.

404
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,521
- Where are they?
- Outside.

405
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,049
Move.

406
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,666
Where are they?

407
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,783
It looks like it's time to negotiate.

408
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,996
Negotiate that, County.

409
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,202
Say hello to our cousin, Ed!

410
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,568
- What is that thing?
- Your basic mobile battle-wagon.

411
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,433
Socrates hired me to bring it back.

412
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:23,598
- How you gonna do that?
- I have no idea.

413
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,608
I think we better get out of here.

414
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,717
Gilbert!

415
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:46,261
- Where the hell you been, Eddie?
- I came as fast as I could.

416
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:48,554
How's your mother?

417
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,467
What is going on around here?

418
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,739
Well, they got Will and Bill and Phil.

419
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,839
We're going to tear this town 
apart until we get 'em back.

420
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,740
That can easily be arranged.

421
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:26,896
Let's do it.

422
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,172
- That's the future of warfare Bowler.
- It's our present future I'm worried about.

423
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,908
Wait a minute - that's it!

424
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,749
You've got to fight the future 
with the future.

425
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,284
- Huh?
- Come on, we've got to find the professor.

426
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,217
This is our town!

427
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,717
- Get out of here!
- What the ...

428
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,361
We built it with our bare hands!

429
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,724
We made it with our sweat and blood,

430
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,901
and you're not taking it away from us!

431
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,815
Who the hell asked you to do that?

432
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,374
Yeah, well, you're welcome too!

433
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,928
Keep goin'! We gotta get it out in the street.

434
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:13,705
- It's just up the street!
- Okay, turn it around!

435
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,574
Heave!

436
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:21,611
Heave!

437
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:28,750
Keep going!

438
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,294
There! Turn this thing!

439
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,631
A little more!

440
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,611
- Professor?
- It's coming.

441
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,236
I'll get it.

442
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,985
- Professor!
- There, got it.

443
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:58,886
Light the fuse.

444
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,353
Okay, everybody take cover.

445
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,839
Well Brisco, if we're going to do it, let's do it.

446
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,609
- Thanks for the beer.
- Sure.

447
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,877
Ma'am.

448
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,623
- Oh! You are there.
- You ready to hit the road, Professor?

449
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,057
Nope, I'm stayin'.

450
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,597
- My rocket needs a little fixing.
- There ain't nothing left of it.

451
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,292
Ilsa and Katrina think they can
pound it back into shape.

452
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:49,030
Oh yeah? Well, I guess they'd 
know best. Take care professor.

453
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,631
Oh, you count on it. Lord Bowler.

454
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:59,007
- So, you ready?
- Yeah, I just have one stop to make.

455
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,311
Bowler?

456
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:04,013
Don't take all night.
We got a long ride ahead of us.

457
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,786
So, I guess we'll be seeing ya.

458
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,295
Thank you.

459
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,228
Well, my pleasure ma'am. My pleasure.

460
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,281
- Heading out?
- Yep.

461
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,552
Thought we'd get that wagon-load of things

462
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,184
back to the people it belongs to.

463
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:45,956
I'm sure they'll appreciate it.

464
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,760
Oh, and I'll get the Federal Marshal 
out here to pick up the Swills

465
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,027
- just as soon as I can.
- Great.

466
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,565
You know, you got a lot of your dad in you.

467
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,075
- He was a good man, Brisco.
- Yeah.

468
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:05,746
You know I never really knew how 
much I missed him until he was gone.

469
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,383
Thank you.

470
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,922
Hey, if you're ever up in San Francisco ...

471
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,618
I think I'll be sticking around 
here for the time being.

472
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,991
It's a good place to live.

473
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,791
Oh, and when the Schwenkes
are done with the professor,

474
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:28,028
you can send what's left of him
to that address.

475
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,639
Ma'am.
