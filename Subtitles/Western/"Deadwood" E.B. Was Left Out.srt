1
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,167
Did you know this fucking walkway
connected us?

2
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:47,792
Several of your patrons, in different
stages of undress, have illuminated me.

3
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:49,844
What happened there?

4
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,129
Not only was my press disabled,
but my office was ransacked...

5
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:57,597
and faeces mounded in the corner.

6
00:01:58,145 --> 00:02:02,723
A message of objection to my handling
of Yankton's notice on the claims.

7
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:04,934
Posting rather than publishing.

8
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:08,736
The camp's new schoolteacher,
a lovely woman...

9
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:11,818
was so traumatised by what happened
that she left!

10
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:15,024
Cy Tolliver?

11
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:18,995
Who didn't even trouble,
when confronted, to deny it.

12
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:27,794
- Why ain't you up and running again?
- I'm in despair.

13
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:33,678
The physical damage is repairable, but
the psychic wound may be permanent.

14
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:41,385
You ever been beaten, Merrick?

15
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:47,185
Once,
when I thought I had the smallpox...

16
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:50,147
Doc Cochran slapped me in the face.

17
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:57,034
- Stop it, Al.
- Are you dead?

18
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:02,155
Well, I'm in pain,
but no, I'm obviously not dead.

19
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,536
And obviously you didn't fucking die
when the doc slapped you.

20
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:07,786
- No.
- So including last night...

21
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,380
that's three fucking damage incidents
that didn't kill you.

22
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:15,296
Pain or damage don't end the world...

23
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:18,883
or despair, or fucking beatings.

24
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,642
The world ends when you're dead.

25
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:27,182
Until then,
you got more punishment in store.

26
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:31,475
Stand it like a man,
and give some back.

27
00:04:03,227 --> 00:04:06,311
You use pigs, too, Lee,
getting rid of bodies...

28
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:08,769
or some other disposal method?

29
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:15,318
I don't bandy my secrets either.

30
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:29,579
- Joanie.
- Thanks for the loan, Jack.

31
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:30,749
Sure.

32
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:34,087
$100 extra is in the wrap
you'll hurt my feelings not to take.

33
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:52,480
What are you
fucking tipping your hat at?

34
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:56,399
- Like one human being to another.
- Glorified fucking monkey.

35
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,703
Joanie Stubbs.

36
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:08,539
How's things at your place?

37
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,829
- There's just me left.
- I see.

38
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:21,879
Could you tell me
what happened to those girls?

39
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:23,631
All six?

40
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,344
I'm asking after my friend Maddie...

41
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:29,600
and Doris that you sent
to work with us...

42
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:32,890
and an outside whore,
pretty-looking, like a doll.

43
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:35,520
That, far as I know,
when I left Wolcott there last night...

44
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:38,776
to come and get you,
was all three still alive.

45
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:41,484
I'd be curious what happened
to the other three.

46
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:46,070
They're sent away, Cy,
never to return or be a problem.

47
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:51,290
As I won't be either to you or Wolcott.

48
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:57,286
And I ask after Maddie and Doris and
the outside girl, not making a problem...

49
00:05:58,382 --> 00:06:01,798
but if Wolcott killed them, and
there's remains, to see them buried.

50
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:03,842
There's no remains.

51
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:10,966
All right.

52
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:19,812
And you're there now by yourself.
Chez Ami.

53
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:26,074
It's no picnic, is it, honey,
running pussy?

54
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:03,945
- It's E.B., Al.
- Yeah, come in!

55
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:08,445
- Morning, Al.
- Request of the widow Garret, E. B...

56
00:07:09,535 --> 00:07:11,777
that I may be allowed
to pay a call on her.

57
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,069
Today?

58
00:07:13,623 --> 00:07:17,122
- Shall I tell her time is of the essence?
- When ain't it?

59
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:22,958
- I'll aim for early afternoon.
- Stop walking with me, E.B.

60
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:24,163
Yes, of course.

61
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:32,303
And if she pries and pokes
and prods me to elicit your intentions?

62
00:07:32,683 --> 00:07:34,723
Tell her I wouldn't say.

63
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:41,101
- And if she asks me why you wouldn't?
- Say you're a pain in my balls...

64
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:45,355
that can't desist from inquiry
till told to shut his fucking mouth...

65
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:48,197
and act on the task
he was asked to fucking do!

66
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:51,366
Yes, sir. Fine. Thank you.

67
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:10,590
Hello.

68
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:15,755
It was bad. There's three gone.
I know it was bad.

69
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:20,344
If you mean the three I saw off,
I'm certain they're safe.

70
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,348
No, they're dead.

71
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:26,317
- A different three?
- My partner and two girls.

72
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:31,106
- Of what, Miss Stubbs?
- They'd been killed.

73
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:33,947
And she must have come here for that.

74
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:37,532
'Cause she would have shot him
and not been scared.

75
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:40,374
She wasn't scared of any man,
first I ever met.

76
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:42,199
I see.

77
00:08:42,294 --> 00:08:46,374
My mama feared my daddy, and I did,
and my sisters, too.

78
00:08:46,923 --> 00:08:50,090
I never met a girl till Maddie
wasn't afraid of men.

79
00:08:50,468 --> 00:08:52,377
And Maddie's dead now?

80
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,092
And Carrie, her girl she brought...

81
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:58,799
and Doris,
who Cy made come with us to spy.

82
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:02,013
And the place, empty of any sign...

83
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:04,678
that they was ever born
or lived or got killed.

84
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:06,683
- And it was Cy Tolliver killed them?
- No.

85
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:09,693
It was a man named Wolcott
killed them.

86
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:14,023
- That works for George Hearst.
- Why?

87
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:17,409
I don't know that. I'm not a man.

88
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,864
I believe I know Wolcott to look at.

89
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:28,579
This is secret, Charlie.
It's only between us.

90
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:34,511
- I told you as a friend.
- And that's how I heard it.

91
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:40,925
I'm your friend. Don't ever walk past me.

92
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:59,942
- Them chinks ain't pulling, Mr T.
- Even at a dime a fuck.

93
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:02,911
What's been your approach?

94
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:07,658
- Cost, primarily. Inexpensiveness.
- The dime.

95
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,671
I'd go with the strangeness, boys.

96
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,291
Take it head on,
turn it to your fucking advantage.

97
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:21,097
Among humans, for grip,
the Chinawoman's snatch has no peer.

98
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:25,639
In all of nature,
the python is its only rival...

99
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:29,429
though few have lived to tell the tale.

100
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:36,111
We are dwarfs
in the company of a giant.

101
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,657
Mind where you stomp your fucking feet!

102
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:47,707
Are you... Are you addressing me?

103
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:51,579
Too late to catch the one
who taught you your fucking manners!

104
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:54,751
Mr Farnum?

105
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:58,044
A selection of choice humbles
for the little girl.

106
00:11:00,472 --> 00:11:04,339
How adorably she sniffs at
the tang of freshness in the kidneys.

107
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:07,222
We've finished our meal, Mr Farnum.

108
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,397
Mrs Garret. Here.
Mr Swearengen, ma'am...

109
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:21,568
with whom your deceased husband
had acquaintance...

110
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:25,242
though I believe you yourself
did not request an interview.

111
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:33,038
Tell Mr Swearengen
I will receive him at 2:00.

112
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:41,341
- A penny for your thoughts.
- I'm glad to be leaving your company.

113
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,134
And as to the purpose of the meeting?

114
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:50,012
- Didn't Mr Swearengen confide?
- He hasn't been well.

115
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:57,225
That's twice
you've fucking stared at me.

116
00:11:57,319 --> 00:12:00,984
- I feel you breathing on my neck.
- Should I exhale out my ass?

117
00:12:01,073 --> 00:12:03,112
And I believe
you're doing it intentionally.

118
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,403
Why? You think I believe
you're a fucking cunt?

119
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:11,417
If we fight, it won't be a casual matter.

120
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:15,791
Oh. I see you got
your big fucking knife there.

121
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:18,751
And hid somewhere on your persons
you've probably got...

122
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,378
some pussified shooting instrument.

123
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,222
But I am good at first impressions,
and you are a fucking cunt!

124
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,518
And I doubt you've fought many men,
maybe even one.

125
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:34,261
Beat it!

126
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,607
And know how it fucking feels
to be helpless.

127
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,404
And have no one
fucking stick up for you!

128
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:49,451
Come on! Get up!

129
00:13:02,175 --> 00:13:04,298
I'll be at Swearengen's place.

130
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:16,970
Charlie!

131
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:22,901
- What did he do, Charlie?
- Personal fucking business!

132
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:36,493
Bullock stepped in.
Tolliver's still headed towards us.

133
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:37,864
Yeah?

134
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,712
2:00, my hotel, the widow Garret's suite.

135
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:44,046
- What do you know of the fisticuffs?
- Amongst who?

136
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:47,960
Utter and that fella you was sitting with
downstairs the other day.

137
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:49,133
Wolcott?

138
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:51,629
Just now, when I was leaving the hotel...

139
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:55,342
Wolcott had accidentally
stepped on Utter's foot.

140
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,390
If Utter's got corns,
that might could have touched it off.

141
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:00,308
Tolliver wanted to see me.

142
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:02,769
Should I bring him up?

143
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,852
Tell him I'll come down.

144
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:08,279
Charlie Utter drove a wagon
out of camp last night...

145
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:10,524
and that whore
that used to work for Tolliver...

146
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,740
was talking to someone
hidden in the wagon bed.

147
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:15,533
You connect that
with the beating in the thoroughfare?

148
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:18,113
Sooner than on Utter's corns.

149
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:21,583
I will station myself downstairs
as an observer.

150
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,505
Yeah, and I will urinate
before meeting Tolliver...

151
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,543
and I can avoid
your fucking hovering, huh?

152
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:33,425
Take your fucking hands off me
and I'll take it fucking easy!

153
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:34,760
You'll stay put?

154
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:38,843
- Don't fucking order me around!
- I'm taking them off.

155
00:14:45,443 --> 00:14:48,444
And please don't go back outside.

156
00:14:53,618 --> 00:14:54,816
What happened?

157
00:14:58,123 --> 00:15:00,115
Cocksucker stepped on my toe.

158
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:08,256
Moving somewhat rheumatic,
young man.

159
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:11,510
God, he's always dragging
that fucking leg.

160
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,300
Early morning fucking chill.

161
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:16,890
In which our deputy sheriff Utter...

162
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:18,932
just kicked the living crap
out of a citizen.

163
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,177
How does that impinge on men like us?

164
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,054
Man beaten is chief geologist
in the Hearst operation.

165
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:26,857
Hearst of the Comstock.

166
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:28,686
Hadn't you heard at all
they were around?

167
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:31,530
Wrong response, no matter
what the fucking provocation.

168
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:33,823
Amen, brother.

169
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:40,527
How do you suggest we proceed?

170
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:46,374
Maybe convene with Bullock and Utter,
discover the details.

171
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:50,458
Let it be known
that's the wrong ox to gore.

172
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:56,384
I'll put together a sit-down.

173
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,571
What can you tell me, Doctor,
of the man with whom I disagreed?

174
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:19,403
Richardson, who summoned me,
said it was Charlie Utter...

175
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:22,491
used to be
Wild Bill Hickok's best friend.

176
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,320
I see.

177
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,158
Several of your ribs are broken.

178
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:33,083
If you wish to occupy yourself in plaster,
I could make some up.

179
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,834
I'll occupy myself otherwise.

180
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,807
My fee is $3.

181
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,102
Does your path cross Mr Utter's,
Doctor?

182
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:51,357
Sometimes.

183
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,770
You might tell him that I own a letter
said to be his best friend's last.

184
00:16:58,158 --> 00:17:02,487
If he would call on me,
I would consider giving it to him.

185
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:07,368
If I do deliver the message...

186
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:11,582
will there be a renewal of the violence?

187
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:16,333
Oh, I hope not, Doctor.
I didn't do well in the original.

188
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:49,535
- AI. A new suit?
- No.

189
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:53,916
The ruddy health of your complexion
may bring the pattern out differently.

190
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:56,578
- I'll see you to the widow's chambers.
- Go back.

191
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:58,711
Of course.

192
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:02,595
Room 2, on the left.

193
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:09,637
Hearst's man convalesces
just to your right.

194
00:18:10,062 --> 00:18:11,889
One thing at a time, huh?

195
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:23,860
Mr Swearengen.

196
00:18:25,244 --> 00:18:29,989
Mrs Garret. How do you do?
Thanks for seeing me.

197
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:42,754
Will you sit down?

198
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:53,307
Late congratulations
on the claim proving out.

199
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:57,562
I had urged patience on your husband
before he had his mishap.

200
00:18:58,068 --> 00:19:01,602
And yet I've always assumed
after my husband's death...

201
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:05,318
you tried to buy from me
through Mr Farnum.

202
00:19:08,661 --> 00:19:10,453
May I go downstairs?

203
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:14,246
Mr Swearengen's only come to talk,
Sofia.

204
00:19:16,002 --> 00:19:17,627
You read in here.

205
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:31,178
- You frighten her.
- I'll have that effect.

206
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:35,099
I think, specifically,
it was your plotting against her life.

207
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:38,689
- I'd take tea.
- What do you wish to discuss?

208
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:41,807
The child's tutor you recently sacked.

209
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:44,820
- Miss Isringhausen?
- She's a Pinkerton.

210
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,655
- I don't find that credible.
- That's the way they like it.

211
00:19:50,244 --> 00:19:54,705
Your husband's family chartered
the agency to pin his dying on you...

212
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,740
so when you're jailed or hanged,
they can bag your gold.

213
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:02,540
How do you support this contention?

214
00:20:02,631 --> 00:20:05,418
Oh, she's come to me.
Wants to give me money...

215
00:20:06,427 --> 00:20:10,555
to confirm what she says you
confessed, that you hired me to kill him.

216
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,763
- How much have they offered?
- $50,000.

217
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:23,982
And how much do you ask of me
as commission to tell the truth?

218
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:25,729
I don't like the Pinkertons.

219
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,528
They'll muscle for the bosses,
as if the bosses ain't got enough edge...

220
00:20:30,617 --> 00:20:33,155
So you'd side with me on principle?

221
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:37,114
- Now I'll finish my fucking sentence.
- Excuse me.

222
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:42,335
I don't like the Pinkertons.

223
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:44,835
Being the Hearst combine
and their fucking ilk...

224
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:48,588
got their eyes on taking over here,
your staying suits my purpose.

225
00:20:48,677 --> 00:20:51,843
As much as you can,
please minimise your obscenities.

226
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:54,462
Before "ilk."

227
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:57,549
Anyways...

228
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:02,806
those are my prejudices and
personal interests for siding with you.

229
00:21:03,358 --> 00:21:07,023
Also, if you want to match their 50...

230
00:21:08,947 --> 00:21:11,235
that would be
between you and your God.

231
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,955
And what warrant would I have
against repetitions of this interview?

232
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,289
Oh, I'd have them write
their offer out and their terms...

233
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:22,704
and make them sign it.

234
00:21:22,794 --> 00:21:25,367
Pinkerton himself, that cocksucker,
I hate that bastard.

235
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:26,542
Please.

236
00:21:28,925 --> 00:21:34,050
I'd make him write out their offer
with their terms and sign it...

237
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:37,721
and I'd turn the document over to you,
to use as evidence against them...

238
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:39,552
if they ever came against you.

239
00:21:42,939 --> 00:21:44,647
Let me consider.

240
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:52,937
And tell that child no hard feelings.

241
00:21:56,994 --> 00:21:59,034
What tea do you enjoy?

242
00:22:00,081 --> 00:22:02,536
I like that fucking black Darjeeling. Oh.

243
00:22:12,593 --> 00:22:15,629
- Have we a new Pope?
- She's some fuck, E.B.

244
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:21,265
I won't fuck Chinese.
I got a mother living yet.

245
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:23,138
She the jealous type?

246
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:25,893
You can't deny it is off-putting...

247
00:22:26,273 --> 00:22:29,642
how them Chinese girls' quivers
don't run quite plum.

248
00:22:29,735 --> 00:22:31,644
That's a fucking libel and a myth.

249
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:34,480
They'll never get my dime.

250
00:22:34,573 --> 00:22:37,064
Another round, Tom, for the board.

251
00:22:37,618 --> 00:22:39,195
You're past due on three.

252
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:43,497
- There are them as do fuck squaws.
- "Pathfinders," I call them.

253
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:45,873
I call mine "Johnny Roger."

254
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:49,494
You ever hear, Tom,
the Chinese whore...

255
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:54,001
has an ancient way of milking you
of your sorrow...

256
00:22:54,384 --> 00:22:59,093
your loneliness and that awful feeling
of being forsaken.

257
00:23:04,561 --> 00:23:07,052
Seems to me
that'd leave you with nothing.

258
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:15,236
In the thoroughfare this morning...

259
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:18,488
an event transpired
which cannot be repeated.

260
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:23,703
As the apostle had it,
time's past for acting like infants.

261
00:23:24,122 --> 00:23:28,202
I assume Mr Utter was provoked,
yet for the sake of us all...

262
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:32,998
the man that provoked him,
employed by who he is...

263
00:23:33,756 --> 00:23:35,796
cannot be fucking beaten.

264
00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:40,303
- What was the provocation?
- Hearst's man stepped on my foot.

265
00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:44,006
- Stepped on his foot.
- Well maybe, Cy, Mr Utter...

266
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:47,639
would want to tell us about
a wagon drive he took last night...

267
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:50,184
and who was in concealment
at the behest of that whore...

268
00:23:50,273 --> 00:23:54,353
used to work for you and how
the morning's shit-kicking resulted.

269
00:23:55,861 --> 00:23:58,435
The background of the beating
ain't the point...

270
00:23:59,156 --> 00:24:01,279
no more than
the incident's particulars, or...

271
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:05,822
how offensive, if I knew them,
I might find the details personally.

272
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:09,580
The Hearst interest
requires special treatment.

273
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:12,711
Now we can face up to that like men...

274
00:24:12,962 --> 00:24:15,369
or get steamrolled
by the fucking alternative.

275
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:17,085
Which is what?

276
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:19,879
Which is them pissed off
they ain't getting treated special...

277
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:22,638
replacing us that don't
with those who fucking will.

278
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:27,134
Did he condescend, Deputy,
to your yelp of fucking pain?

279
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:30,926
Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ!

280
00:24:31,855 --> 00:24:34,263
I don't care what brought it on.

281
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:37,400
Say it as murder, or more than one.

282
00:24:38,362 --> 00:24:42,691
George Hearst's chief geologist
don't get convicted of any crime...

283
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:45,155
in any court convened by humans.

284
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:49,997
They'll buy the judge, and if they can't,
the jury or witnesses.

285
00:24:50,207 --> 00:24:52,033
If not, they'll start into killing.

286
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,919
What the fuck are we talking about?

287
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:58,464
Why would we want to know?

288
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:01,837
Well, Cy...

289
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,636
all that geologist did
was step on Utter's foot.

290
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:09,718
Are we fucking done here?

291
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,560
Because if you people ain't,
I fucking am!

292
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:26,190
If Hearst's geologist ain't
pursuing remedies, and Utter ain't...

293
00:25:27,368 --> 00:25:29,491
that leaves you speaking for the camp.

294
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:39,624
Adjourned.

295
00:25:44,218 --> 00:25:47,303
- He wants to talk to you.
- Who?

296
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:51,845
- Wolcott.
- We transacted our business.

297
00:25:52,143 --> 00:25:56,140
He says he has Hickok's last letter.

298
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,768
If you see him, he'll give it to you.

299
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:05,233
I hear you say
Wolcott wants to see Utter?

300
00:26:11,245 --> 00:26:12,620
The bald contempt of it.

301
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:15,622
Why not come out five abreast?

302
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:19,742
Cavorting and taunting,
"E.B. Was left out. E.B. Was left out."

303
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:23,126
Cocksuckers. Cuntlickers.

304
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:25,915
Make your filthy gestures.

305
00:26:26,093 --> 00:26:29,296
Public service
was never my primary career.

306
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,637
Two come this way.

307
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:39,896
I only hope, Sheriff, us having
just come to fucking consensus...

308
00:26:39,982 --> 00:26:42,473
you intend no further worrying
on this matter.

309
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:43,766
I don't.

310
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,731
Or, for your own sake,
that you're coming here to fucking eat.

311
00:26:48,115 --> 00:26:50,819
- Gentlemen.
- Farnum.

312
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:54,527
Come from the gathering
of the worthies.

313
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,074
Whatever was purposed
by your get-together at The Gem...

314
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:02,790
I hope came to full fruition.

315
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,201
Thanks.

316
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,049
I believe she's in.

317
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:11,758
As is the child.

318
00:27:11,846 --> 00:27:14,420
Which may confound his intention.

319
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:33,357
Mr Bullock. Please come in.

320
00:27:42,502 --> 00:27:44,827
I apologise for calling unannounced.

321
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:48,876
You find us in only a mild disarray.

322
00:27:49,926 --> 00:27:53,591
Sofia has me for teacher now,
as well as guardian.

323
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:09,068
How are you feeling?

324
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:14,108
Well, thank you,
as I hope you are and your family.

325
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,528
We're all very well.

326
00:28:21,457 --> 00:28:26,617
I feel better, lately, in the afternoons
than in the morning.

327
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:33,170
You find the right time of day
to surprise me.

328
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:40,176
Mr Star, with whom I met yesterday,
was not so fortunate.

329
00:28:40,475 --> 00:28:42,634
Was that a morning meeting?

330
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:44,680
I fell ill at its conclusion...

331
00:28:44,771 --> 00:28:49,101
or, my falling ill
was the conclusion's cause.

332
00:28:50,444 --> 00:28:52,602
We discussed formation of a bank.

333
00:28:52,988 --> 00:28:57,448
It's an excellent idea, and Sol
would be an excellent chief officer.

334
00:28:57,534 --> 00:28:58,862
I'm glad of your opinion.

335
00:28:58,952 --> 00:29:02,997
And generous on your part,
who need not put capital at risk.

336
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:05,576
- Thank you.
- And supportive of the camp...

337
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,410
at a crucial hour of its history.

338
00:29:07,502 --> 00:29:08,877
Thank you very much.

339
00:29:10,505 --> 00:29:12,794
Would it be better for you if I left?

340
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:17,634
- We seem to be conversing amiably.
- I mean the camp.

341
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:22,468
Because I am unwell in the mornings?

342
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:24,678
Would it be easier for you?

343
00:29:30,316 --> 00:29:33,899
Why would your leaving change, in any
material way, my situation?

344
00:29:33,987 --> 00:29:37,486
I mean,
as to your seeing me in the camp...

345
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:40,068
more or less daily...

346
00:29:41,244 --> 00:29:43,367
would you prefer not to?

347
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:48,198
Mr Bullock, if you believe...

348
00:29:48,835 --> 00:29:50,911
the change in my condition...

349
00:29:52,255 --> 00:29:55,006
and the decent concern for others...

350
00:29:55,132 --> 00:29:57,291
we claimed as our purpose
in separating...

351
00:29:57,385 --> 00:30:00,588
dictates now your leaving the camp...

352
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,891
and uprooting your family,
I will not judge your decision.

353
00:30:06,227 --> 00:30:08,800
But, please, do not ask me
to make it for you.

354
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,185
I understand.

355
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:17,485
I do not wish to make things
more difficult for you.

356
00:30:21,784 --> 00:30:23,242
Will you stay?

357
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,536
Will she be certain to know?

358
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:35,004
It becomes you.

359
00:30:41,804 --> 00:30:44,211
I guess my concern is...

360
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,933
why you would invite to come calling,
the man that nearly beat you to death.

361
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:52,604
To know why he did it.

362
00:30:54,775 --> 00:30:58,144
Well, I can save you time with that,
Mr W.

363
00:30:59,154 --> 00:31:02,737
Utter was dismayed
you killed them whores.

364
00:31:03,492 --> 00:31:04,737
Now...

365
00:31:06,828 --> 00:31:08,655
instead of information...

366
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:13,033
would your true goal be...

367
00:31:15,503 --> 00:31:17,330
further rebuke?

368
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:20,960
Getting cuffed around a little more?

369
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,844
Let me hire someone for the job,
'cause Utter's liable to kill you...

370
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,256
- and I don't need you dead.
- Get out.

371
00:31:34,189 --> 00:31:38,020
You are tough to be a friend to.

372
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:41,645
You make a good point.

373
00:31:44,157 --> 00:31:47,158
- Only, one would think as mayor that...
- I don't know, Farnum!

374
00:31:47,326 --> 00:31:49,153
- Well...
- I don't fucking know!

375
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:52,744
By all means, then,
let's just let the matter rest.

376
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:57,871
Go back. Go back!

377
00:32:07,054 --> 00:32:08,798
Much more fucking mobile.

378
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:12,136
What's this about?

379
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:16,093
I'm done at that hardware store with
their fucking harping and badgering.

380
00:32:16,188 --> 00:32:18,181
Who's harping? The Jew?

381
00:32:19,525 --> 00:32:23,060
- Are you making a fucking pun?
- I'm asking a fucking question.

382
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:26,857
The Jew. And fucking Bullock also.

383
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:30,737
I'm erratic with my decimals
and the like.

384
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:33,698
So harping now is a hardship...

385
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:37,039
on the same fucking order
of a boot on your fucking neck?

386
00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:41,745
Do not fucking fault them, Trixie,
for your own fucking fears...

387
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:44,080
of tumbling to something new.

388
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:50,381
Meaning you want me back there,
secreted and listening in.

389
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:54,298
Attentive in particular
to talk of Hearst's geologist.

390
00:33:01,858 --> 00:33:03,898
Mind your fucking decimals.

391
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:16,281
- Charlie Utter didn't happen to look in?
- No.

392
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:22,916
As protective an eye as Charlie has
for that madam, Joanie Stubbs...

393
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:25,293
if all her whores
didn't make it to that wagon...

394
00:33:25,382 --> 00:33:27,623
and that was on Wolcott's account...

395
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:31,006
you could see what ensued
in the thoroughfare.

396
00:33:36,267 --> 00:33:37,809
I saw Mrs Garret.

397
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:41,808
I support your enlisting
in her banking venture.

398
00:33:43,107 --> 00:33:46,025
- Good.
- She is as you thought.

399
00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:47,527
I thought so.

400
00:33:50,865 --> 00:33:53,819
- I'll take the air.
- Don't on my account.

401
00:33:54,702 --> 00:33:58,569
I come to apologise
for my work with the decimals...

402
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,615
and my attitude over my errors.

403
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:05,460
And since I do tend to be prickly
when in the wrong...

404
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:10,089
if you on your part was to realise
Moses did the heavy lifting already...

405
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:12,836
the fucking tablets and so forth.

406
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,926
That might lighten the atmosphere, too.

407
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:23,434
Sure.

408
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:33,320
Guidance for me,
before you turn to your numbers?

409
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:38,200
Tread lightly,
who lives in hope of pussy.

410
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:52,673
- Is that a white male?
- Where?

411
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:57,221
Issued from that Chinee whore-hut
and walking like a man relieved.

412
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:01,216
Well, he is repositioning his Johnson.

413
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,424
Sir!

414
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:06,223
May I and my friend have a moment?

415
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:12,233
We were wondering if...
If you fucked a chink.

416
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:18,318
- What would that be to you?
- Well, they're under our care.

417
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,988
We're their supervisors.

418
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:25,238
Yeah. At a... decent fucking remove.

419
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:28,330
Well, say I did?

420
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:32,173
Well, we'd be eager to know the result.

421
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:36,669
- Was it worth the fucking dime?
- You feel that they were overpriced?

422
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,463
It was well worth the dime.

423
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:43,884
There's a run on from the other side
of camp all the way down the creek.

424
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:48,473
Tallest fucking Chinaman I ever seen
is keeping the line in fucking order.

425
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:50,440
- Really?
- Yeah, well...

426
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:53,983
a lot of fellas, you know,
outpaced by white pussy's price.

427
00:35:55,863 --> 00:36:00,157
- Well, thank you for your time, sir.
- Thank you for that information.

428
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:05,906
Jesus Christ!

429
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:09,284
You know that fucking Chinaman
he made reference to, don't you?

430
00:36:09,669 --> 00:36:13,713
Better suited than us
in every fucking aspect of the task.

431
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:18,634
Fluent in both languages
and don't mind standing in filth.

432
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:23,553
A man, as it happens a rival of mine...

433
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:26,179
learning the secret
of a great man's lieutenant...

434
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,391
would make that lieutenant his slave.

435
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:31,725
My rival knows that expanding
the circle of the informed...

436
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,938
diluting his power,
will confound his intention...

437
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:38,355
so he takes precaution
to be sole sharer of his secret.

438
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,985
And the world being the world...

439
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,620
along comes
a half-assed knight errant...

440
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:51,449
Utter, Hickok's ex-partner...

441
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,416
to put all my rival's plans at risk.

442
00:36:57,174 --> 00:37:00,128
I'd seek audience with Utter,
verify my thinking.

443
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,626
He earns his bread shipping packages.

444
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,299
And as the dimwit nobility
that made him intercede...

445
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,135
may now make him reticent...

446
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:11,686
you, chief, will be my prop and ploy...

447
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:15,140
whilst I seek to draw him out.

448
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,280
I congratulate myself
on having kept you around.

449
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,609
Why make a show of disposing of you,
was my fucking thinking.

450
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:31,289
It's not like we need the storage space.

451
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:35,407
And if there's a chance in 1,000
you people have been praying right...

452
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,334
why get your boss's attention?

453
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:46,257
Anyways, I have no plans
us parting company.

454
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,474
As you will note...

455
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:54,479
I have inscribed no address.

456
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,436
Miss Here-She-Was-
Where's-She-Gone.

457
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,163
What's that to you?

458
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,211
Only I got packages could be halfway...

459
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:21,289
by now to Cheyenne.

460
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,958
What, is it fucking Tuesday already?

461
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,303
It's fucking Thursday, Jane.

462
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:33,593
So I got five days left
before I got to leave.

463
00:38:33,727 --> 00:38:37,179
- No.
- Oh, I see.

464
00:38:41,151 --> 00:38:45,279
- Well, you look your usual piece of shit.
- My, you, Jane...

465
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:49,194
you look like dew on fucking roses.

466
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,782
I woke up on the dirt...

467
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:03,122
in the fucking graveyard...

468
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:07,760
- questioning dusk or dawn.
- It was dusk.

469
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:10,881
I know it was dusk
because it's fucking night now.

470
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:15,560
Fucking bruises everywhere.

471
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:17,680
Dished out by who?

472
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:29,815
It's getting the upper fucking hand
on me, Charlie.

473
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:38,957
- Go on upstairs and clean up.
- Right. Thank you.

474
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:45,165
- Go on up. Hurry up, Christ's sakes.
- All right, Charlie. Thanks.

475
00:39:51,888 --> 00:39:54,889
- Evening.
- I'm fucking closed.

476
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,594
Bankers' hours, huh?

477
00:40:03,733 --> 00:40:05,441
Where is it going anyway?

478
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:09,696
Jesus Christ.

479
00:40:11,616 --> 00:40:14,985
She neglected
to inscribe the destination.

480
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:19,362
Anyways...

481
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:23,448
as far as this morning
in the thoroughfare...

482
00:40:23,544 --> 00:40:27,293
- I'd have done the same fucking thing.
- I'm done fucking talking about it.

483
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:30,916
Don't care who he works for,
thinks he can get away with that.

484
00:40:31,552 --> 00:40:33,960
You give that cocksucker
what he fucking needed.

485
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:37,632
Sick fucking bastard.

486
00:40:39,685 --> 00:40:42,520
I knew when I saw the wagon,
for Christ's sake.

487
00:40:45,524 --> 00:40:48,062
- Poor fucking girl.
- Tolliver's whore.

488
00:40:48,152 --> 00:40:51,271
- Never seen a girl so distraught.
- Wouldn't you be?

489
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:56,024
Being a man,
you believe you've seen your equal.

490
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,570
No, not to that.

491
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,494
She told me, too.

492
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:10,080
- She told you what?
- What she saw.

493
00:41:12,426 --> 00:41:14,667
She didn't see fucking nothing.

494
00:41:14,761 --> 00:41:17,335
No, I don't mean "see"
in the sense of seeing.

495
00:41:18,932 --> 00:41:20,925
Get the fuck away from me.

496
00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:26,726
Yeah, right.
Let me get this address put on.

497
00:41:29,442 --> 00:41:30,771
Evening.

498
00:41:35,156 --> 00:41:37,363
Every fracas ain't a victory, chief.

499
00:41:41,955 --> 00:41:43,069
Al.

500
00:41:44,374 --> 00:41:45,405
Al?

501
00:41:47,085 --> 00:41:49,658
- Why, Al?
- Why, E.B.?

502
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:52,335
Because being present at that meeting
and made as you are...

503
00:41:52,423 --> 00:41:54,665
blackmail would've proved irresistible...

504
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:57,926
and pursuing it
would have gotten you murdered.

505
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:01,467
Thank you, then.
And am I still the mayor?

506
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:05,138
For all of me, in perpetuity.

507
00:42:12,527 --> 00:42:15,646
- Full fucking day, eh, boss?
- They all are.

508
00:42:15,738 --> 00:42:17,814
Still got that package, I see.

509
00:42:17,907 --> 00:42:20,362
Ain't nothing gets by you, Johnny.

510
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:22,574
I'm going to head up to Cheyenne
first thing in the morning.

511
00:42:22,703 --> 00:42:25,621
Don't think
that's the idea anymore, Dan.

512
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:30,287
What happened to Tolliver illustrated...

513
00:42:30,377 --> 00:42:34,838
till the race is fucking finished,
never mark the fucking wager paid.

514
00:42:37,843 --> 00:42:41,757
Wakes up this morning, in bed
with the fucking Hearst combine...

515
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:43,756
knowing he's got us by the balls.

516
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:47,767
Whatever sick fucking business
that geologist has transacted...

517
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:50,934
you can bet he had his wrists in it up...

518
00:42:51,023 --> 00:42:52,398
- Tolliver?
- Tolliver, yeah.

519
00:42:52,483 --> 00:42:54,890
Before, after and
in the fucking middle, too...

520
00:42:54,985 --> 00:42:57,772
thinking he's got the fucking edge,
which is the right fucking move.

521
00:42:57,863 --> 00:43:02,026
Underwriting whatever sick business
that fucking geologist was involved in...

522
00:43:02,117 --> 00:43:06,197
guarantees his fucking position,
but what fucking happens, Dan?

523
00:43:08,582 --> 00:43:11,203
Fucks himself up the ass, Tolliver?

524
00:43:11,293 --> 00:43:14,543
No mean feat,
yet how often we bring it off.

525
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,756
Who impressed me at that meeting
was Bullock...

526
00:43:20,844 --> 00:43:24,343
that avoided putting his pet interests,
innocence, so forth, guilt...

527
00:43:24,431 --> 00:43:28,808
fucking who did what to fucking who,
before the needs of the fucking camp.

528
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,975
It shows fucking progress.
It shows growing maturity...

529
00:43:34,024 --> 00:43:36,775
to what makes
the world's fucking tail wag.

530
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,185
Anyway...

531
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,947
that's why Cheyenne's cancelled.

532
00:43:45,577 --> 00:43:47,616
Well, I figured as much.

533
00:43:49,247 --> 00:43:51,323
You want to fuck me, Jack?

534
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,038
- When haven't I?
- Would you pay?

535
00:43:57,755 --> 00:44:00,329
Can I double your mark
and call it a gift?

536
00:44:00,425 --> 00:44:04,007
- That way I keep my illusions.
- Let me borrow this beauty, Jack.

537
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:08,880
- All yours, boss.
- You seem subdued.

538
00:44:10,017 --> 00:44:11,927
I'm good and fucked up, Cy.

539
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,140
Not nearly as your friend, Mr Wolcott.

540
00:44:17,275 --> 00:44:21,735
His day was busy as his night.
Got his balls beat by Charlie Utter.

541
00:44:24,031 --> 00:44:28,444
Sweetheart, them that's dead is gone.

542
00:44:29,078 --> 00:44:31,154
We give them to God and move on.

543
00:44:31,997 --> 00:44:36,161
Hell, you didn't have to see them.
Fucking throats cut.

544
00:44:38,003 --> 00:44:40,411
You didn't clean up their gore.

545
00:44:40,506 --> 00:44:43,673
Don't tell me you cleaned up
anyone's gore, Cy.

546
00:44:48,514 --> 00:44:52,677
Your friend Maddie's problem,
young lady? Didn't want to get old.

547
00:44:53,977 --> 00:44:56,219
- Well, who the fuck does?
- Shut up, Cy.

548
00:44:56,313 --> 00:44:58,638
But them of us
with stamina and fortitude...

549
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:00,559
don't go searching out some maniac...

550
00:45:00,651 --> 00:45:03,272
with a straight razor
to put us from our fear.

551
00:45:03,362 --> 00:45:04,476
Stop talking.

552
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:08,272
I won't stop talking,
nor show the fucking future my neck.

553
00:45:10,744 --> 00:45:13,365
Nor forbid it in a fucking friend.

554
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:23,661
I propose, instead, you and me,
Miss Stubbs...

555
00:45:24,716 --> 00:45:27,254
wrestle the fucking future to the ground.

556
00:45:27,677 --> 00:45:32,304
We fix your place up, get all new stuff,
open the fuck back up.

557
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:35,056
Knowledge ain't general
what happened there...

558
00:45:35,143 --> 00:45:37,681
and those who know ain't gonna say.

559
00:45:45,737 --> 00:45:48,524
Grant me at least, as your friend...

560
00:45:49,491 --> 00:45:53,275
if we don't partner,
while that maniac is loose in camp...

561
00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:54,994
you'll avoid that fucking place.

562
00:45:57,707 --> 00:46:00,993
Move back here, Joanie,
where I can fucking protect you.

563
00:46:02,337 --> 00:46:03,451
No.

564
00:46:10,261 --> 00:46:14,175
What the fuck did you come here for,
if not to be protected?

565
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:20,434
Don't be like your dead fucking friend,
afraid to face the truth.

566
00:46:22,648 --> 00:46:25,733
I was just looking to turn a trick.

567
00:46:33,117 --> 00:46:34,492
Mr Utter...

568
00:46:36,162 --> 00:46:39,447
you'll agree our shaking hands
would be incongruous?

569
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:43,410
I come for my partner's letter...

570
00:46:43,502 --> 00:46:46,539
which you told Doc Cochran
you would give me.

571
00:46:48,674 --> 00:46:53,003
I can't guarantee it's genuine,
but it has the feel of authenticity...

572
00:46:53,762 --> 00:46:55,885
and it's clear
he would want her to have it.

573
00:46:59,435 --> 00:47:02,186
- To his wife, then.
- Agnes Lake.

574
00:47:06,942 --> 00:47:09,729
Prudence dictates
my requiring in return...

575
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:13,151
your account
of what Miss Stubbs told you.

576
00:47:13,448 --> 00:47:16,615
The prudentest thing you can do
is not name that girl again...

577
00:47:16,702 --> 00:47:18,860
with me in the fucking room.

578
00:47:19,371 --> 00:47:23,997
It was she, this nameless she,
who set you upon me.

579
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:28,625
"Agnes, darling, if such should be
we never meet again...

580
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:34,292
"while firing my last shot, I will gently
breathe the name of my wife Agnes.

581
00:47:35,262 --> 00:47:37,634
"And with wishes even for my enemies...

582
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:41,423
"I will make the plunge
and try to swim to the other shore.

583
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:46,305
"J.B. Hickok, Wild Bill."

584
00:47:46,398 --> 00:47:50,312
You keep this shit up, you're going
to earn a trip out the fucking window.

585
00:47:50,402 --> 00:47:54,233
I am simply asking confirmation
of what you were told, and by whom.

586
00:47:54,322 --> 00:47:57,109
And I'm promising I'll sooner
blow off your fucking head...

587
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,489
and take the fucking letter
from your corpse...

588
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:01,949
- than confide any fucking particulars.
- To me?

589
00:48:02,038 --> 00:48:05,905
To any-fucking-one,
when I give my word I wouldn't.

590
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:14,549
Thank you, Mr Utter.

591
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:18,669
That's what I wanted to know.

592
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:45,954
Open or closed?

593
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,625
Open, please.
