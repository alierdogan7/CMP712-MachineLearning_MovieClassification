1
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,070
- Turn your toes in.
- All right.

2
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,412
Nod your head.

3
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,663
It looks like
Old Sunshine is still champ.

4
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:45,110
So far, no one has ridden him
for the eight second count.

5
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,444
Getting a Brahma bull
to leave isn't easy.

6
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,476
Get off the wall.

7
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:01,751
The first bull rider
is Pascadera's only cowboy...

8
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,956
and the former champion
in this event...

9
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,988
J.R. Bonner.

10
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,998
And he drew for himself

11
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,060
the current champion
Brahma bull...

12
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,005
Buck Roan's Old Sunshine.

13
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,417
And he ain't never been rode.

14
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,479
Hang around, old J.R.

15
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,299
His name's Red Terwiliger,
although a lot of cowboys...

16
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:44,064
are calling him money bags
these days.

17
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,631
Red Terwiliger and his
Brahma bull called Tornado.

18
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,651
Best score on that ride...

19
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,625
75 points
on a maximum score of 100.

20
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,422
That puts Red out in front.

21
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,943
...Rodeo Cowboy Association
and officials...

22
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,648
thank you very much
for coming out.

23
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,349
We hope you've enjoyed it.

24
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,051
Please drive safely,
walk carefully.

25
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,410
Maybe I ought to take up
another line of work.

26
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,008
See you in Prescott, J.R.

27
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,969
Fill it up, sir?

28
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,741
Let me have four gallon.
Make it regular.

29
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,779
Hello.

30
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,013
Howdy.

31
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,259
- Howdy, mister.
- Hi.

32
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,931
Well, she's about
two quarts low.

33
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,371
You want to let me
have that forty weight?

34
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,965
Forty weight? You bet.

35
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,845
- I'll take some of them apples.
- We have some nice, fresh ones.

36
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,472
All right.

37
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,490
That'll be thirty cents.

38
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,565
Thank you.

39
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,998
You bet.

40
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,783
It's 8:45
in the Mile High City.

41
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:43,262
Robert B. Goode here.
You're in tune to KMOT radio.

42
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,287
The temperature
stands at 78 degrees

43
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,390
outside of the studios.

44
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,367
Locally,
up to 40,000 visitors...

45
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,700
- Hi, J.R.
- Hey, how's the bull rider?

46
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,069
Lonesome.

47
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,836
Hey, give him a beer.

48
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,468
Not for long.

49
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,639
Wait till you try
our brand of sunshine.

50
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,735
Come on, boys.
Come and get it.

51
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,243
A little more, Pete,
a little more.

52
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,365
Ace!

53
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,560
Oh, Ace!

54
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,148
Sorry I missed you, Ace.

55
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,541
Have you seen Ace Bonner?

56
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,880
Who?

57
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,682
Ace Bonner!

58
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,382
Never heard of him!

59
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,691
It only costs $5,000, Curly.

60
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,033
I don't need a penny more,
and I wouldn't take it...

61
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,833
if you dropped it
playing solitaire.

62
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,032
I can hit it, boy.

63
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:31,065
Ace, you never missed...

64
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,840
not when it came
to costing me money.

65
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,475
All right, so I never found much
of that Nevada silver.

66
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,611
But, Curly, this time,
I'm talking about Australia...

67
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,985
gold.

68
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:46,150
Dad, Australia's a long reach.

69
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,591
It's too long for me.

70
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,426
But, boy, I've already invested
my last 3,000 in this project.

71
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:54,762
I don't want any part of it...
not a penny of it.

72
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,236
I'm fed up to here
with your schemes.

73
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,363
If you want to stick around
here, that's fine with me.

74
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,466
I'll put you on a weekly
allowance, but that'll be that.

75
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,437
Send his bill to me, Rose.

76
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,385
Well, anyway, honey,
I'm in your hands.

77
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,652
The nurse's best equipment...
her hands and her heart.

78
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,057
My hand on your heart, Rose.

79
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,323
...but first
a word from our sponsor.

80
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,956
Hi, folks, I'm Curly Bonner.

81
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,932
Have I got some news for you.

82
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,231
Neighbors, if you're thinking
about a second home...

83
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,702
or retirement
in the clean air country...

84
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,433
then look no further than my new
mobile home development...

85
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,703
Iocated just east
of Prescott, Arizona...

86
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,039
the Mile High mountain area...

87
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,772
with friendly people waiting
to meet and greet you.

88
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:44,010
Now, come out and visit me
at the Bonner Trading Post.

89
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,928
- Howdy, men.
- Howdy, Buck.

90
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,523
Hi, Buck.

91
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:38,002
Hey, you boys mind getting
down off the fence there?

92
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,134
Thank you.

93
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,376
Hey, Claude, put this old
black hookin' son of a bitch...

94
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,782
in by himself somewhere.

95
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,048
- I'll get him.
- I'll get him.

96
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:03,324
Hey, watch him there.
He'll stick his tongue in you.

97
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,964
Get in there.

98
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,830
Come on, cattle!
Now, now!

99
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,543
Get in there!

100
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,151
Get in there!

101
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,558
What's that black little
orange number?

102
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,720
Just a second. Eleven.

103
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,457
Check.

104
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,459
Thanks.

105
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,058
This is a rough way
to miss a paycheck, J.R.

106
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,501
You'd have to be an idiot
to ride one of them bulls.

107
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,981
Hey, Junior, you got
to watch that old bull.

108
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,651
He's meaner than a snake.

109
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:17,423
Most fellas would like to
trade him off for a hound pup...

110
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,227
and then pay $10
to get the hound pup shot.

111
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,408
Well, good morning, J.R.

112
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,539
J.R., how are you?

113
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,311
- How's everything, Bill?
- Real good.

114
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,113
- Sure glad to see you.
- Nice to see you. Hello.

115
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,517
- When did you get in?
- Last night.

116
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:46,013
We got your entry. Got you down
for the bronc riding...

117
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,083
the bull dogging,
the bull riding...

118
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,287
and the wild cow milking.

119
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,660
You can put my dad's name down
for the wild cow milking...

120
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,823
and I'll do the mugging.

121
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,356
That sounds great. Good to see
you and your dad together again.

122
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,697
Thank you.

123
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,703
- What did that come to, Frances?
- 125.

124
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,433
125 out of 150.

125
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,406
OK, 25,
plus 6, 7, 8, 9...

126
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,315
and 30. And 20 makes 50.
We sure thank you.

127
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,945
Punch all those bulls
in the morning about 10:00.

128
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,217
- I'll be there.
- Real good.

129
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,689
You haven't seen my dad
around, have you?

130
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,021
No, I sure haven't.

131
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,720
I saw Curly yesterday, though.
I bet he'd know where he is.

132
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,455
Much obliged.

133
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,725
- We sure thank you.
- Thank you.

134
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,960
- See you later, now.
- All right.

135
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,041
Yeah, war paint.

136
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,307
Good morning, Red.

137
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,439
J.R.

138
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,575
You got Pontiac
and Chino Valley.

139
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,175
Yep.

140
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,084
Yeah. I didn't see you
around the palace.

141
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,322
I slept outside.

142
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,950
Lend me $15, Red.

143
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,291
You already owe me 25.

144
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,456
Well, that's 40.

145
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,100
You got change?

146
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,897
Well, now, I'll get it.

147
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,702
Hey, come around tonight,
and I'll win that back from you.

148
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,305
Hey, yeah, why don't you
stick around, J.R.?

149
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,043
Are you coming?

150
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,311
I tell you what we could do...

151
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,114
if y'all get your car
and everything...

152
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,419
All right.

153
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,156
See ya.

154
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,226
Big hearted, ain't he?

155
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,629
Yeah, Red.
Heart almost as big as yours.

156
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,901
Hey, York,
Buck Roan still around?

157
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,532
No, he went down to the palace.

158
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,968
Hey, J.R. Hello.

159
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:20,979
- Ben.
- Good to see you.

160
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,981
- Nice to see you.
- Welcome home, J.R.

161
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,243
Good to be home, Del.
Thanks.

162
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,477
First drink's on the house.

163
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,848
Well, that's a change,
isn't it?

164
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,443
Two beers.

165
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,820
Dos cervezas. Yes, ma'am.

166
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,347
Sure been a spell, J.R.

167
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,392
Por mi amigo. Tome mucho.

168
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,563
You betcha.

169
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,000
Hey, you girls.

170
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,903
Will you go home
and get your IDs?

171
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,031
Just go home and get legal,
will you, please?

172
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,269
You always say that, Del.

173
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,972
Yeah, the sweetest things.

174
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,037
See you later.

175
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,638
J.R.

176
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,085
Hello, Homer, Red.

177
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,086
Hi, J.R.

178
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,111
- You want a beer?
- Don't mind if I do.

179
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,919
Why not? I can't dance.

180
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,323
Hey, Buck,
I'll be right there.

181
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,588
I'm not going anywhere.

182
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,495
You ready for another?

183
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,833
Just leave her on the bar.

184
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,528
Del.

185
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,036
Don't you know it?

186
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,800
Fine.

187
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,000
Have a seat. Sit down.

188
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,407
How you feeling?

189
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,175
Not bad. Not bad.

190
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,647
You act like you're hurting.

191
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,013
I'm just fine.

192
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,755
You contracting
the Salinas show, are you...

193
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,222
after you close out here?

194
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,452
Hell, I got to go on
to Cheyenne...

195
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,654
and rest my stock
a little bit.

196
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,731
You looking forward to riding
for your hometown folks?

197
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,703
Yeah. Me and my dad
are gonna be working...

198
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,330
the cow milking together.

199
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,638
Well, that's a pair to draw to.

200
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,974
Well, that's me and Ace,
all right.

201
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,244
Money?

202
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:14,187
Well, money's
nobody's favor, Buck...

203
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,162
but I want to ride that
Sunshine bull of yours again.

204
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,527
The way your luck's running...

205
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,466
you're just liable
to draw him again.

206
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,233
I just don't want to be
counting on my luck.

207
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,797
You know I don't
set the draw, Junior.

208
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:33,004
Now, listen, most cowboys would
pay you to stay off that bull.

209
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,711
I don't suppose you're
thinking about paying me...

210
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,581
to draw him for you, are you?

211
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,645
Well, it's just like I said...

212
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,020
money's nobody's favor.

213
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,189
I'll be damned
if you're not serious.

214
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:54,324
Just one of him and one of me.

215
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,826
Look, Junior,
neither me or my bull...

216
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,429
aim to make a living
off another fella's pride.

217
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,905
Now, you might as well face it.

218
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,467
You're just not the rider
you was a few years back.

219
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,351
I need it, Buck.

220
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,479
It's my hometown.

221
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,682
Talk to him on your time, J.R.

222
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,885
He's on my time now.
Right, Buck?

223
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,896
That's right.
You heard what the man said.

224
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,626
I got to go to work before
somebody else gets his money.

225
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,634
Maybe you'll get lucky
in Salinas, J.R.

226
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,033
Yeah.

227
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,593
- Hey, Red.
- Yeah.

228
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,002
Come on.

229
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,976
I'll ride that bull
for half the prize money.

230
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,410
You sure are
a man of confidence.

231
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,313
And mighty generous, too.

232
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:51,049
That's me, Buck...
just full of confidence.

233
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,148
I'll give you that.

234
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,489
Come on, Buck.
We're all set up.

235
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,529
Deal the cards, boys.

236
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,065
Now, easy, boy.

237
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,760
I'm one of the good guys.

238
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,374
Go ahead.

239
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,072
He's your pa's dog, all right.

240
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:24,513
He'll either shake your hand
or bite it off.

241
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:47,200
Well, let's see.

242
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,763
You're lookin'
just fine, sugar.

243
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,173
Come on, now.

244
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,437
Here, let me have
those tomatoes.

245
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:53,444
Yeah.

246
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,503
You farming now, are you?

247
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,015
Sure as hell am tryin'.

248
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,217
What's the old man's dog
doin' here?

249
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,281
Waitin' on him to get out
of that hospital, that's what.

250
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,194
Well, what's he doing there?

251
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,323
He ran off the Cherry Creek Road
last night.

252
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,265
Was he drinking?

253
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,642
What do you think?
Totalled his truck.

254
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,044
Is he OK?

255
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,547
He's fine.

256
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:34,609
The thing is, the devil
sure takes care of his own.

257
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,314
I went up to the ranch
looking for Ace...

258
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,584
and somebody's turned that place
into a gravel pit.

259
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:41,717
- Did you know that?
- Yeah. Curly.

260
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,494
Ace sold out to him.

261
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:54,998
He got this notion to prospect
for silver up in Tonopah.

262
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:02,945
And then he left
with 15,000 in his jeans.

263
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,846
That's all Curly paid him
for that land, is $15,000?

264
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,411
That's all.

265
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,149
Four sections up there.

266
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,717
I know.

267
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,460
Curly and Ruth still
run that place up the highway?

268
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,873
They're the two busiest people
in this county.

269
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,036
Curly started
a mobile home development...

270
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:36,309
on the ranch right in back
of the trading post.

271
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,975
And he isn't stopping there.

272
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,484
Junior...

273
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,082
where are you going to stop?

274
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:55,024
Well, about that money
I haven't been paying you...

275
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,397
Iooks like there's
gonna continue to be...

276
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,662
an interruption there.

277
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:00,193
Is that what it's called?

278
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,832
A continued interruption?

279
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,775
Well, don't worry about it.
It doesn't matter.

280
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,937
Your brother
is taking care of things.

281
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,547
He's selling this place, is he?

282
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,915
Why not?

283
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,512
Mobile homes
are the thing of the future.

284
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,285
Yeah.

285
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,024
Curly coming to supper tonight?

286
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,655
Yeah.

287
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,792
I think he wants to see you.

288
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,028
OK.

289
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:36,266
You and Ace.

290
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:40,209
Maybe you're the lucky ones,
drifting the way you do.

291
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,974
Maybe.

292
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:56,185
How long you been
keeping boarders, Mom?

293
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,785
A year.

294
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,224
- Where you going?
- I'm going up to the hospital.

295
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,531
Figures.

296
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:09,004
See you tonight.

297
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,526
Is he hurt bad?

298
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,425
I can keep him
off the ceiling...

299
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:36,331
but I can't keep
his hands off me.

300
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,392
Come back in the morning.

301
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,529
He was asking for you.

302
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:48,542
When he wakes up, you tell him
I'm around, would you?

303
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,454
Folks, if you gather around...

304
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,457
I'd like to tell you a few words
about the Reata Rancheros.

305
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:04,154
Now, the Bonner Trading Post
was established in 1955.

306
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,322
It was ten years before
the last clean air in America...

307
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,697
was reportedly seen
in Flagstaff, Arizona.

308
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:12,202
I'm no fancy scientist. I'm just
a United States businessman...

309
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,465
and I'm proud of it.

310
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,664
But I'll guarantee you...

311
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,435
Prescott's air
is as clean or cleaner...

312
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,204
than our illustrious neighbor
to the north.

313
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,542
We have an air-conditioned
chartered bus over here...

314
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:26,243
to take you for a free tour
of the Reata Rancheros.

315
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,444
And we have these lovely
young ladies in hot pants...

316
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:31,421
passing out free maps
and brochures.

317
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,219
You'll find at
the Reata Rancheros...

318
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,488
Come to the bus.
It's about ready to load.

319
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,461
Pick up a brochure
on your way out.

320
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,056
Would you like a cookie
before you leave?

321
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,229
...and total, but I mean total,
electric living.

322
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,862
Now, I hope you enjoy
the free lemonade...

323
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,102
and cookies courtesy of
Curly Bonner's Trading Post.

324
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,738
Bonnie, Toby.
Excuse me, folks.

325
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,514
Step right this way,
ladies and gentlemen...

326
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,179
for a home on the range
retirement...

327
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,314
just ten minutes
from city shopping.

328
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,916
Hey, Junior.
How you doin', boy?

329
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:10,854
Good to see you.

330
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,624
Yeah? Hey, yeah.

331
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,030
How's that rodeo life
been treating you?

332
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:19,867
I got no complaints.
Curly, what are you doin'?

333
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,270
Hey, boy, I'm just making money
hand over fist.

334
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,605
You wait until you see
what I got lined up for you.

335
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,475
Hey, girls,
let's roll 'em, huh?

336
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:28,809
You just gonna love
what's happening here.

337
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:32,009
I'll see you at Mom's tonight.
7:00 dinner, sharp.

338
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,143
Let's go, ladies and gentlemen.

339
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,209
Come on!

340
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,777
Step aboard, folks.
Come on, now.

341
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,880
Everyone, let's go.
The bus is loadin'.

342
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,323
Here you go.
Let me help you there, ma'am.

343
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,826
Come on down the highway

344
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,795
In the twilight of your life

345
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,799
Come and see Reata Rancheros

346
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:52,098
Come and bring your wife

347
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,967
Bring the little children, too

348
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,633
Because when
they've all grown up...

349
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,376
Then with the house gone,
then there's no problem.

350
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,880
Here, things are gonna be better
all the way around.

351
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,975
Mama's going to be living
inside of model home trailers.

352
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,015
Well, Mom can show
the people...

353
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,889
how roomy and comfortable their
lives can be on our Rancheros.

354
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,554
And she can be in charge
of our gift shop.

355
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,187
That would really
give her a chance...

356
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,663
to get rid of
some of these antiques.

357
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:27,504
Mom, do you have to smoke
while you're feeding our baby?

358
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,073
Almost forgot, boys.

359
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,512
Here's a couple of free ones...
best seats in the house.

360
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:42,382
Gee, thanks, Uncle Junior.

361
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,514
Now, you pass your Uncle Junior
those mashed potatoes and gravy.

362
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,895
You get some good draws
for tomorrow, Uncle Junior?

363
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,490
You better believe.

364
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,697
You could ride anything
with hair on it, Uncle Junior.

365
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:03,366
Well, you pays your money,
you takes your chances.

366
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,670
Pass the whiskey.

367
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,734
There never was a horse
that couldn't be rode...

368
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,804
there never was a cowboy
that couldn't be throwed.

369
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,550
Famous old saying, all right.

370
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:16,553
Well, Curly says that
you've seen one rodeo...

371
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,713
you've seen 'em all.

372
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,746
Well, I didn't mean
our rodeo, darling.

373
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,123
That's a part of history.

374
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,493
Well, still, it's just a rodeo.

375
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,455
So, you went to see him?

376
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,980
Yeah.

377
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,797
How much was it that you paid
for the old man's land?

378
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:13,072
15,000. Yeah,
which he proceeded to gamble...

379
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,409
and throw away in Nevada.

380
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,778
But he had to quit
prospecting...

381
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:21,342
twenty feet away from
mother lode, just like always.

382
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,717
It don't seem much.

383
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,187
2,600 acres.

384
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,885
Well, now he's got this scheme
to go to Australia.

385
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,522
Well, why don't you send him?

386
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:34,395
Come on, Junior. I put him
on a weekly allowance...

387
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,559
and that's that,
and I told him so.

388
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,327
You know what I mean?

389
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,302
Yeah.

390
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,073
Why don't you start thinkin'...

391
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:52,878
about your own self
for a change?

392
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,544
You may not know it...

393
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:59,249
but you are in the right place
at the right time. It's here.

394
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,281
It's a regular
land boom, Junior.

395
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,453
Yeah, I saw
your wide open spaces.

396
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,726
You know less about
wide open spaces than I do.

397
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,995
I know it here...
where it is.

398
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,366
You're just some kind
of motel cowboy.

399
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,507
15,000 just seems
a little bit short.

400
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:28,542
15 or 30,000,
he still would've blown it all.

401
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:33,614
Now, he needed the money fast,
and I got it for him. Me.

402
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,293
I just want you to get a grip
on your future.

403
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,169
I want you to come work for me.

404
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,640
You want me to help you
sell the old man's land?

405
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,108
Our land.

406
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,678
Junior...

407
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,183
What a salesman you'd make
for the Rancheros.

408
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,923
Big cowboy like you...

409
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,664
sincere...

410
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,634
and you're genuine
as a sunrise.

411
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,675
Well, there's no point
in foolin' ourselves...

412
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,576
now, is there?
You got to ride.

413
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,274
Giddyap, giddyap. Got to ride.

414
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,520
That's right, Curly.

415
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,252
Salinas, California.

416
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,324
Day after tomorrow.

417
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,358
Will you think on what I said?

418
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,803
I just don't want you
turnin' out like the old man...

419
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:04,975
Curly! Curly,
what's happened?!

420
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,075
My God, you've killed him!

421
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,710
Damn, what a lickin'.

422
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,349
Junior...

423
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,119
Don't say it. I'm goin'.

424
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:17,218
And I'll send somebody over
tomorrow to fix that window.

425
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:20,389
And you take his
damn dog with you!

426
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:22,667
You just can't
walk out of here.

427
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,692
You just can't
walk out of here.

428
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,930
You see my feet on the floor,
don't you, Arlis?

429
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,734
Now watch my legs
make 'em move.

430
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,206
But you're not well enough!

431
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,733
I'm heaven-bound, sweetheart,
but not today.

432
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,040
Get that cleaned up,
will you, please?

433
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,843
Junior was in yesterday,
and he said he was coming back.

434
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:41,215
Well, he'll find me,
or I'll find him.

435
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,514
Bye-bye, sweetheart.

436
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,420
Ace, you get back in this room.
I'll use force if I have to.

437
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,755
You're not leaving
this hospital...

438
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:51,227
no matter what.
Orderly!

439
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,025
Orderly, stop this man!

440
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,395
Stop him!

441
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,161
I don't fight fair, boys!

442
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,031
And you are a fool,
Ace Bonner!

443
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,196
Adios, sweet angel of mercy.

444
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:16,943
Where to?

445
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,581
To the rodeo, partner.
Where the hell else?

446
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,101
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.

447
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,634
Well, do I get that draw,
or don't I?

448
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,274
I been thinkin' on it, Junior.

449
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,122
Kick in the head, Junior.

450
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,623
That's what it's about.

451
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:01,064
You know, Junior, if a man was
going to expand his business...

452
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:04,693
I'm talkin' more shows
and more towns...

453
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,398
he might be interested
in an assistant.

454
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,738
Say, a fella
that'd been around some.

455
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,074
A champion in his day.

456
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,651
Well, I just thought
I'd mention it.

457
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,582
Don't think so, Buck.

458
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,354
You had breakfast?

459
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,696
Nope.

460
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:40,329
How about we go down here and
get a little bread and gravy?

461
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,037
That'll be fine right there.

462
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,618
Keep the change, son.

463
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:05,493
Hey, dog. Where you been?

464
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,824
Stay here, boy.

465
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,898
Hey, you pretty
little girls...

466
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,335
you look like you might've
seen Junior Bonner.

467
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:24,040
No, but I'd be glad
to give him any message...

468
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,309
anytime.

469
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,749
Now, how'd I know
you was gonna say that?

470
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:33,848
Who do you suppose he is?

471
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,883
All those contestants planning
to ride in the parade...

472
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:40,055
please assemble
at the south parking lot.

473
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,078
Come on, come on.

474
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,110
Let's get on the float, OK?

475
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,063
Ace Bonner slept here.

476
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,091
He said he'd find you.

477
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,596
Here you go.

478
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,607
I'll make sure
he takes his medicine.

479
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,311
Hi, Ace.

480
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,790
Hey, Roy.
Are you still livin'?

481
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:44,191
Still around and kickin'.
How you been makin' it?

482
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,354
Better than I deserve.

483
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,988
Goin' down to get
in the big parade?

484
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,225
Don't you know it?

485
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,233
How many we rode in, Roy?

486
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,427
Not enough, Ace.

487
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,464
Not enough
and maybe too many, huh?

488
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,098
Too many, probably.

489
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,868
I wonder if I can hold him off
that first narrow.

490
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,504
I think I got company.

491
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,781
Hey, pretty little girls...

492
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,346
I want you to meet
Mr. Ace Bonner.

493
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,516
- How do you do, Mr. Bonner?
- Howdy.

494
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,086
No. That's me.

495
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,755
You J.R.'s dad?

496
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,664
I used to be. Didn't I, Roy?

497
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,065
That's right.

498
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,930
Come on, let me show you
the way into town.

499
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,495
Afraid we'll get lost?

500
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:29,972
No, I'm afraid
I'm gonna lose you.

501
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,371
- So long, Roy.
- So long, Ace.

502
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,570
No way, not me.

503
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,380
Hey. Johnny Muller.

504
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,053
Where's my horse?

505
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,393
Ace Bonner.

506
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,125
Ace?

507
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,866
You fellas just sit around
and let him take it?

508
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,164
Yeah.

509
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:02,506
Have we got all
our bull riders here?

510
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:04,565
Have we got all
our bull riders here?

511
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,132
'Cause I'm closin' the books.

512
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:07,541
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

513
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,570
OK, well, here's what
we got today for you boys.

514
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,081
OK, Jones...

515
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,350
number 46...

516
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,186
Spike.

517
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:25,218
Tom Acuff. Number 16, Tom...
Tojo.

518
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,162
OK, Jimmy Morgan...

519
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:30,724
number 86... Buttermilk.

520
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,206
Terwiliger,
Red Terwiliger...

521
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,869
number 35...
Thunderbolt.

522
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,673
Thunderbolt?

523
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,612
It's all right, Red.
You'll make him look good.

524
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,911
Just watch it, J.R.,
if you got time.

525
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,883
I got the time.

526
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,848
Bonner...

527
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:56,553
draws number 62,
Sunshine.

528
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:01,092
That's Sunshine
twice in one week, J.R.

529
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,928
I'll buy you some more tape.

530
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,230
- All right, Red.
- Where you goin'?

531
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,669
I gotta go find my dad.
He stole my horse.

532
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:20,048
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Prescott, Arizona...

533
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:22,279
and the 84th annual
Frontier Days celebration...

534
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,288
and the national
Fourth of July parade.

535
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:41,532
The grand marshal
in this Frontier Days parade...

536
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,735
Mr. Casey Tibbs.
How you doing, Casey?

537
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,072
Welcome to Prescott.

538
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,773
There's Ace Bonner.

539
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:54,340
Hi, Ace! Where you been?

540
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,687
Hey, Ace!

541
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:04,421
If you're still on your feet...

542
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,486
remember,
that first dance is mine!

543
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,227
I'll do 'er.

544
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,384
Howdy, folks.

545
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,325
Get your hot dogs,
your hard candy right here...

546
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,955
compliments of yours truly,
Curly Bonner...

547
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,397
from the Reata Rancheros!

548
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:50,164
Get your hot dogs, kids!

549
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,300
Get your hard candy!
That's what it's for!

550
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,209
Prescott's
junior high school band.

551
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:07,587
Seen the old man?

552
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:11,424
Yeah, he's up ahead between
the Indians and the flag.

553
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:14,521
I'm gonna
whip your ass, Junior.

554
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,192
Well, somebody is.

555
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,997
It ain't gonna be
the first time.

556
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,666
Hi, Bonnie.

557
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:25,732
Howdy, J.R.

558
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,710
- How you doin'?
- Fine.

559
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:31,238
Hello, Ruth.

560
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,010
J.R.

561
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,786
You always did love
a parade, Ellie.

562
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,025
You always did
sit a good horse, Ace.

563
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,464
Where'd you steal it?

564
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,853
We'd certainly like to thank...

565
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:47,356
the Air Force band
for being with us today.

566
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:48,824
Ladies and gentlemen...

567
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,458
Hello, cowboy.

568
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,654
I like your horse, Ace.

569
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,621
So do I.

570
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,257
Climb aboard.

571
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,581
Are you sober?

572
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:50,984
I'm as sober
as the day you met me.

573
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,251
I've been tryin'
to find you all day.

574
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,191
I was lookin' for you.
You stole my horse, Ace.

575
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:01,588
Ladies and gentlemen,
Yavapai County's own Ace Bonner!

576
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,563
And, riding with Ace Bonner,
his boy J.R. Bonner...

577
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,036
twice Frontier Days
champion bull rider!

578
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,436
Let's hear it!

579
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:15,100
I got a bottle, Ace.
You want a drink?

580
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,416
Watch them drunken idiots!

581
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:23,476
That's Junior's old man!

582
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,578
Watch out!
Don't run over 'em!

583
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,448
And here's Curly
of Reata Rancheros!

584
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,892
How you doin', Curly?

585
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,867
Ace!

586
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,471
Ace!

587
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,647
Hey, hold on!

588
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,448
What's the matter, son,
don't you like us?

589
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,182
All right, Ace, let me up
in the saddle, damn it.

590
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,587
Come on, you get up here
where you belong!

591
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,286
- No, you ride in the back.
- Mind your dad!

592
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:10,127
Yeah!

593
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,498
Easy!

594
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,841
Great.

595
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:21,972
Come on,
get up here, cowboy.

596
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,344
Get that damn horse
outta my yard!

597
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,010
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

598
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,677
For Christ's sake.
We're goin'.

599
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,850
You're gonna
get us killed, Ace.

600
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,938
Yeah.

601
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:56,571
- I gotta sit down.
- You and me.

602
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,911
Well, you fall off
better than I do.

603
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,284
Yeah.

604
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,987
That's the best ride
I've had...

605
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:10,857
since Christmas Eve
in Tonopah...

606
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,225
and I was snowed in.

607
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:13,320
Bobbie's?

608
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:16,662
Me and the buckeye.
She sends her regards.

609
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:24,170
Oh, yeah.

610
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,938
You ever hear
from Johnny Mars?

611
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,744
Yeah. He's bustin' horses
out of Carlsbad.

612
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:35,580
Still makes the El Paso show.

613
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,417
And Buddy Cox...

614
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,821
always hollered,
"As long as women live...

615
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:42,552
"my name will never die."

616
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,321
Well, he's dead, Dad.

617
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,228
Car crashed between
Abilene and Dallas.

618
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,398
Well, I hear
you're doin' very well.

619
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,097
Where'd you hear that?

620
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,544
Takin' care of Mom, are you?

621
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:04,069
Not much.

622
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:07,140
She's sellin' antiques
out the townhouse.

623
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,549
She's happy.

624
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:11,611
She's livin' right where she
wanted to live all her life...

625
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:15,318
right in the middle
of things.

626
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,054
Curly's gonna sell that house.

627
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:20,562
Put her in a curio shop.

628
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:24,359
Curly's doin' right well.

629
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:29,399
Junior...

630
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:33,298
I'm goin' to Australia.

631
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:36,835
What are you gonna do,
hunt kangaroos?

632
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,814
Gold for the findin',
that's what.

633
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:42,477
150,000 square miles
to prospect.

634
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:46,114
And sheep. Marino.
Finest wool in the world.

635
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,351
I already made
the down payment.

636
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,253
How would you like
to come down there with me?

637
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,324
Hell, I know you can't make it.

638
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,563
Not a big rodeo star.

639
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:05,132
But at least you could
grubstake your dad.

640
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,972
I'd make you
partner number one, Junior.

641
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,106
Partner number one.
What do you say to that?

642
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,445
There's somethin'
I gotta tell you.

643
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,212
No, somethin'
I gotta tell you...

644
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,879
about mining.

645
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,081
There's a lot to learn.

646
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:22,523
Rare metals... big future.

647
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,753
I'm busted, Ace.

648
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:26,785
Of course, you never
tried your hand at prosp...

649
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,902
Busted?

650
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,931
Flatter than a tire.

651
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:44,541
Well, all I need is 5,000.

652
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:47,482
Heh. How about five million?

653
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,427
Well, it's time to go to work.

654
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,240
If you're not too old to rope.

655
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:23,609
I'll do the muggin'.

656
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,409
Got us entered.

657
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:28,611
- Wild cow milkin'?
- You bet.

658
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:29,982
Come on.

659
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,095
Curly paid you the money
for the land, Pop.

660
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,654
What'd you do with it?

661
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:44,258
The honest intentions
of a man...

662
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,234
trying to make money
with money.

663
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:49,067
The unfortunate prey...

664
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:53,405
to the evils of nighttime ladies
and neon lights.

665
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:57,277
But, no, sir,
no matter what he says...

666
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,941
not penny one from Curly
will I take.

667
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:02,607
And I mean that.

668
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:04,950
Because...

669
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,552
Ace, one more parade.

670
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,358
Come ride in
the grand entry with us.

671
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:17,230
Can I steal your horse
again, Junior?

672
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,996
What's mine is yours.

673
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,004
Busted?

674
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:34,776
Opportunity of a lifetime.

675
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,344
Come on, girls.

676
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,288
All bronc riders report...

677
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:43,986
Acuff, Terwiliger,
Carson, and Bonner.

678
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,498
Damn it.

679
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:55,302
Well, if it isn't
Junior Bonner.

680
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:57,568
Hey, folks,
this is Junior Bonner.

681
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,638
Burt Hunsacker.

682
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:03,373
You remember me.

683
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,413
Six years ago,
a little place in Nogales.

684
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:10,009
Right after the Tuscon show?

685
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:12,317
Six years is a long time.

686
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,152
But you're sure
lookin' good, Burt.

687
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:29,435
Here's your grand entry...

688
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:32,600
for this, the 84th annual
Frontier Days Rodeo...

689
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:35,110
the oldest professional rodeo
in America.

690
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,408
It was on July 4th, 1888...

691
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,278
that cowboys
from the surrounding ranches...

692
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,909
first gave as an entertainment
to the people of Prescott...

693
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,851
an exhibition
of ranch activities...

694
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,548
and cowboy sports...

695
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:47,982
Hi, J.R.

696
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,254
The Prescott Frontier Days
celebration...

697
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:57,130
is the original cowboy rodeo
in America...

698
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,157
and in the years since,
it has continued to be...

699
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,864
one of the most honored and
well-known rodeos in America.

700
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,302
Hey, Bill, let me have
that rope, will ya?

701
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,782
I should mention here
that if any of you...

702
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:16,114
were at the big parade
downtown earlier this morning...

703
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:18,382
and are wondering if that fella
in the blue shirt...

704
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:20,480
on the Roan horse
is gonna compete today...

705
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:21,820
I can tell you he will.

706
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,691
Ace Bonner will be a contestant
in today's rodeo.

707
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,321
He's been a part of the rodeo
for 42 years.

708
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:30,389
Now here's the grand marshal
of this year's rodeo...

709
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:34,927
twice world champion,
all-around-cowboy Casey Tibbs.

710
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:36,905
Our rodeo stud contractor...

711
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,931
the man responsible
for all the bucking horses...

712
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,068
steers, and bulls
you're about to see...

713
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:42,236
Buck Roan.

714
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:44,269
Buck Roan of Amarillo, Texas.

715
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,106
And here's a pair of fellas...

716
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,482
who'll be entertaining you
this afternoon...

717
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,248
Tom Lucia...

718
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,152
and joining Tom...

719
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:55,953
the clown bull fighter
from Enid, Oklahoma...

720
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:57,152
Jim Hill.

721
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:58,854
All right, Tom. Hold it.

722
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,227
Better save that
for the Palace bar.

723
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:36,623
All right. There's $5,000
total prize money...

724
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,293
waiting on
these cowboys today...

725
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:40,359
so let's get
to the first event...

726
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,132
saddle bronc riding.

727
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,822
Number three, J.R. Bonner...

728
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:10,519
on a bronc named...

729
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,323
Hold it, J.R.

730
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:15,125
Don't start your ride
till the gate's open.

731
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,925
Get down on it easy, J.R.

732
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:20,837
Don't make no noise
on that gate.

733
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:21,565
Don't make no noise
on that gate.

734
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,075
Don't ask for it. Just...

735
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,738
Put him out, J.R.!

736
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,020
That a boy!
Rake him, rake him! That a boy!

737
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:07,349
A good ride
and a good try, J. R...

738
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:08,748
but a little short.

739
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,253
Let's have a hand
for J.R. Bonner.

740
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:18,022
You know somethin', Ace?

741
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,119
Old Junior's gonna
spoil all my horses...

742
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,961
if he don't quit
blindfoldin' 'em with his ass.

743
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,104
Can't win it that way, J.R.

744
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,303
No, you can't win 'em all,
partner.

745
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:41,078
Good ride. The score
for Bobby Fenly was 62.

746
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:45,045
Steer Wrestling.

747
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:46,884
Here's an event that
requires perfect timing...

748
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:48,652
on a straight run.

749
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:50,420
Bulldogger jumps
from his horse...

750
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:51,949
grabs the steer
by the horns...

751
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,791
stops him,
and puts him down.

752
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,458
That's that.
And as far as I know...

753
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,989
the steer is still runnin'.

754
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:01,902
$850 total first prize money.

755
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,873
J.R. Bonner...

756
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,242
Red Terwiliger
doing the hazing.

757
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,907
Steer number 42.

758
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,816
You're up, J.R.

759
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:26,321
- Ready, J.R.?
- Yep.

760
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,057
You're up.

761
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,389
All right. The boys are ready.

762
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,165
Good time for J.R.

763
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:14,794
A mighty fast time.

764
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:17,738
The best so far today...
8 and 2/10 seconds.

765
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:19,707
8.2 for J.R. Bonner.

766
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:27,573
Now the boys
will switch around...

767
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:30,881
with J.R. Doing the hazing
for Red Terwiliger.

768
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,785
You gonna beat
J.R.'s time, Red?

769
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,949
Steer 38!
Red Terwiliger!

770
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,866
He did it.
Time for Red Terwiliger...

771
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:53,340
6 and 5/10 seconds.

772
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:58,508
Tough luck, cowboy.

773
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:01,778
It happens
all the time, dude.

774
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:03,079
I'll tell you what...

775
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,950
if you were to take
a cattle stampede...

776
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:07,148
and cross it
with a barroom brawl...

777
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,679
you just might come up
with something...

778
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:11,318
resembling our next event...
wild cow milking...

779
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,555
Now, don't you wait
for my loop to settle, Junior.

780
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:15,928
I'm accurate number one,
so the minute I throw...

781
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:17,933
you get your tail
in motion, boy.

782
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:20,299
And then I'll do my thing,
as they say.

783
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:23,169
Before we turn loose
those boys...

784
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,502
we got penned
in that circle over there...

785
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,667
They're the muggers,
and it's the muggers's job...

786
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,506
to hang on
and slow down the cow...

787
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:30,011
while the roper gets down
from his horse...

788
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,513
and handles
the milking chores.

789
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,812
You muggers and ropers remember
whose team it is, won't you?

790
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,044
All right,
turn the cows loose.

791
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:38,519
Here they come.
Rope 'em down.

792
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:06,511
Over here, Junior!
Here's your place.

793
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:09,017
Over here, Ace!
Come on, Ace!

794
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:45,349
That dog bit me again!

795
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,791
Get that dog outta here!

796
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,462
Not our cow, you knothead!

797
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:28,588
Damn it.

798
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:31,031
Get that yellow
son of a bitch outta here.

799
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,237
Come on, Ace!

800
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:37,796
Hang on to her, Junior.
I gotta fill it up again!

801
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:44,109
Gimme another shot at it.

802
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:49,841
- Come on, Ace!
- All right. One more second.

803
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:50,977
OK!

804
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,920
Hey! Hey, look out!

805
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:57,859
- Give me the bottle!
- No, no, no, I got it!

806
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:00,123
Come on, gimme that bottle!
Gimme the bottle!

807
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:01,527
I got it!

808
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:04,624
The winning team is
Rudy Martinez and Ray Poole.

809
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:08,666
Will somebody get
that damn dog?

810
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:19,178
We could've won.

811
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,206
We did, Ace.

812
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,115
How about a special hand now...

813
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:26,178
for the oldest contestant?
Ace Bonner...

814
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,089
Sixty years young
and still going strong.

815
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:32,651
And will somebody get that dog
the hell out of here?

816
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,390
That concludes the first half
of our performance.

817
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:41,767
We're going
to take a break now.

818
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:44,705
See you all back here at 3:30
for the concluding events...

819
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:48,073
in our Fourth of July
Frontier Days Rodeo.

820
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:16,697
So, what happened to her?

821
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:19,503
Just one of those things
you grin at and drink to.

822
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:26,139
Into the mouth
and over the gums...

823
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:28,376
Iook out, stomach,
here she comes.

824
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,919
Lord, but that does heal
the aches of a loser.

825
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:40,127
If this world's
all about winners...

826
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:42,027
what's for the losers?

827
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:44,430
Well, somebody's gotta
hold the horses, Ace.

828
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,061
You're right.

829
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,237
See you fellas later.

830
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:54,708
Now, you're gonna be there...

831
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:56,404
when I deal with that bull
of yours, ain't you, Buck?

832
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:58,913
Yeah, Junior, I'll be there.

833
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,877
Well, don't look at me, boy.

834
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,911
I don't make no decisions
with a drink in my hand.

835
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:08,422
Then you'd better
put that drink down...

836
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:10,015
'cause you've
got company, Ace.

837
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:14,161
He's in the navy now, Elvira.
Just home on leave.

838
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:15,458
That's fine, just fine.

839
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,432
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
I'm in trouble, son.

840
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:20,935
Take a deep seat, Ace.

841
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:22,698
If this is any of your idea...

842
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:24,865
I'll blister your tail
from here to next Wednesday.

843
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:26,704
You're not nervous,
are you, Ace?

844
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:31,205
Hi, Junior!

845
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:32,304
Hi, Grandpa!

846
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,747
How've you been?

847
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:36,546
Come on up here. You, too.

848
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:37,984
Golly, I missed you.

849
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,488
Did you kill any lions?

850
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,251
Did you find any silver?

851
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,287
Hello, Ace.

852
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:48,762
Mrs. Bonner.

853
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:51,694
Lookin' very well.

854
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:54,635
You don't look so bad yourself,
considerin'.

855
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:57,036
Dad, could we have a drink,
please? We're thirsty.

856
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:58,300
Yeah, please, Dad.
We're awful thirsty.

857
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,568
Why, sure you can.

858
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:01,371
We'll all have
ourselves a drink.

859
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:02,536
- Del?
- Yes, sir.

860
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:04,102
Beers all around
for these midgets.

861
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:05,841
Ace, Cokes.

862
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,850
- A round for me and my boys.
- Comin' up.

863
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:11,182
- Ruth?
- No. Beer is fine.

864
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,949
Ellie, I seem to recall...

865
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:15,957
you had an occasional taste
for bourbon whiskey.

866
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:17,788
Didn't think you'd remember.

867
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:19,623
Who could forget?

868
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:25,463
It was a nice float
you had, Curly.

869
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:27,969
Finished second
in the commercial division.

870
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:30,403
Well, second's
better than third.

871
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:35,036
Ellie.

872
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,271
Thanks.

873
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:40,638
This calls for a toast.

874
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,014
We are all together.

875
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,575
You're up, Ace.

876
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:48,187
Well, since I am
top of the pile...

877
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:53,385
to them as has
their roads ahead.

878
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:00,594
Ace?

879
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:02,831
Our dance.

880
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:03,860
Arlis.

881
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:09,943
Well, you all know Arlis here.

882
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:11,605
I've heard the name.

883
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:13,080
Hello, Mrs. Bonner.

884
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:17,611
Our dance, Ace.

885
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:20,019
Didn't you always save
the first dance for Mom, Ace?

886
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:21,750
It's a good idea, Ace.

887
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,623
Boys, times have changed.
I changed them.

888
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,889
Dance with her, Ace.

889
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,739
Sweet combination.

890
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,109
I can't dance
with both of you.

891
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:51,448
Come on, sweetheart,
let's cut it together.

892
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,004
Curly.

893
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,402
Come on, kids.

894
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:28,679
You want a beer, Curly?

895
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,994
Just like old times.

896
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:49,541
Now would you like a beer?

897
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,799
Junior, you're my brother...

898
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,302
and I guess I love you.

899
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:16,827
Well, we're family.

900
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:20,665
I don't care what you do.

901
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:22,836
You can sell one lot
or a hundred lots.

902
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:26,075
I'm just tryin'
to keep us together.

903
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,050
I gotta go down my own road.

904
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,211
What road?

905
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,983
I'm workin'
on my first million...

906
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:36,582
and you're still workin'
on eight seconds.

907
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:44,390
Curly?

908
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,957
Come on.

909
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:47,730
Come on, let's dance.

910
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,619
Here's a little song I wrote
for all the rodeo hands.

911
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,485
It's called "Rodeo Man."

912
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:16,088
I'll be in town
this weekend, honey

913
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,190
Look for me downtown

914
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:21,293
Anytime after
the band starts playin'

915
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:23,236
I'll be around

916
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:25,865
I'll park my two-horse trailer

917
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:27,932
Up at the rodeo grounds

918
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:30,342
Then I'll start roarin'

919
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:32,609
I'm the rodeo man

920
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:39,243
I picked up 35 bucks in Reno

921
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,221
Couldn't get a decent ride

922
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:44,521
But I'll do all right
in the Frontier Days

923
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:46,493
Unless all the good bulls die

924
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:49,088
I was raised
in the town of Prescott

925
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:51,463
I got my home folks
on my side

926
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,695
I'm gonna win top money

927
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:56,670
I'm a rodeo man

928
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:02,335
Gonna enter in the broncs
and the ropin'

929
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:04,504
On Saturday afternoon

930
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:07,447
And the bull ridin'
in the night show

931
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:10,110
While the band plays
a cowboy tune

932
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:12,677
And if I could just
draw me a mean one

933
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:14,348
Then stick on it
just like glue...

934
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:15,913
Champagne.

935
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:17,447
And three double bourbons.

936
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:19,517
I'm a rodeo man

937
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:38,242
When my last ride's over

938
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,840
And my ribs
are all taped down

939
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:43,442
I'll pick up
my top money buckle

940
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:46,045
And, honey,
we'll head for town...

941
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:48,552
Dance with me?

942
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,388
You do dance, don't you?

943
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:56,022
You're a little
out of line, Junior.

944
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:58,726
Not really.

945
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:02,400
I'll dance with him.

946
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:04,632
Yeah!

947
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,769
Hey, how about playin' somethin'
a little bit slower?

948
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:13,479
One dance, Junior.

949
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,312
I can't count much further.

950
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,875
Today I

951
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:20,717
Started lovin' you

952
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,747
Again

953
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:28,361
And I'm right back

954
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:30,159
Where I really
ought to be...

955
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:32,598
Hey, J.R.,
where'd you get the new doll?

956
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:34,966
What you doin', Casey?

957
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:37,972
That's a young filly
I picked up down in Cheyenne.

958
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:41,402
Just long enough

959
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:47,040
To let my heartache mend

960
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:49,448
Then today

961
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:52,749
I started loving you

962
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,154
Again

963
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:10,764
I got over you...

964
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,240
Hey, you mind if I cut in J.R.?

965
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:15,106
Well, I'll tell you
the truth, Red.

966
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:17,373
I kinda do.
Nothin' personal.

967
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:20,745
Well, I hope she treats you
better than Sunshine.

968
01:20:20,782 --> 01:20:22,010
So do I, Red.

969
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,245
Who's the Sunshine
in your life?

970
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:25,947
Just the bull I'll be ridin'.

971
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:49,304
Thank you, J.R.

972
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:53,003
Hi, sweetheart.
Anybody ever tell you...

973
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:54,606
- You get.
- What?

974
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,173
Come on, I mean it.

975
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,690
Red's at it again!

976
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:09,820
Hold it! Hold it down!

977
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,127
You fight like
my old lady, Red!

978
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,793
We can't have no fightin'
around here.

979
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:15,736
Come on, Terwiliger!

980
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:17,067
Watch him, Buck!

981
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:22,367
- What's your name?
- Charmagne.

982
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,047
Why do they call you Junior?

983
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:32,451
Well, I tell you the truth,
I don't know.

984
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:35,718
- It got stuck, huh?
- Yeah.

985
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:37,122
Oh, no!

986
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:39,884
You from Phoenix?

987
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,953
Curly Bonner smacks
the gringos!

988
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:43,828
You work down here, do you?

989
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:45,230
In the bank.

990
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:49,999
It's not very exciting
compared to what you do, is it?

991
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:51,801
Well, not unless
you own the bank.

992
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,982
Misdeal.

993
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,607
My old lady's over there,
you know that?

994
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:34,672
Hey, sweet cheeks!

995
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:36,843
Come on,
let's get out of here!

996
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:38,409
Go on. Get the kids!

997
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:58,265
I watched you today.
You were pretty good.

998
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:00,274
I fall off a lot, don't I?

999
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:08,373
Keep clear, boys.
My dog don't fight fair.

1000
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:13,381
Do you always run
with that crowd?

1001
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:17,790
No. Anyway, it looks like
this crowd may not make it.

1002
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:18,986
No, I don't think so.

1003
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:23,726
Eat it! Eat!

1004
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,271
You got a girl?

1005
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:37,005
Why?

1006
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:38,239
Why not?

1007
01:23:40,982 --> 01:23:42,279
I'm just passing through.

1008
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:45,783
Where to?

1009
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:48,618
I'm goin' up to Salinas,
El Paso, down to Fort Worth.

1010
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:53,020
Just like old times.

1011
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:54,585
Driving cowboy.

1012
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:56,756
Stop it! Stop it!

1013
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:16,610
Better hold up there!

1014
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:30,960
I think it's time to play
something patriotic fellas.

1015
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:32,796
Yeah, hold it, hold it.

1016
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:35,064
Let's do
"The Star Spangled Banner".

1017
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,507
Stop! No! OK? Stop!

1018
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:23,881
Hey, Curtiss,
let's have a drink, huh?

1019
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:26,216
The fightin' excitement's
all over with.

1020
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:30,216
Here we go.

1021
01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:33,450
- Thank you.
- You betcha.

1022
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:34,826
Think I'm feeling
a little better...

1023
01:25:34,863 --> 01:25:36,387
now I'm drinking this beer.

1024
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:39,628
Yeah? What are you chasin'
all the girls for?

1025
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:40,793
I love 'em.

1026
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:45,238
No, no, Del,
it wasn't no bronc, but a bull.

1027
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:47,969
Name of Holy Joe.

1028
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:49,203
You remember him, Roy?

1029
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:50,506
Yeah, I remember him.

1030
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:53,412
Old Holy Joe...
blind in one eye...

1031
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:55,848
meaner than a boot
full of barbed wire.

1032
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,386
He sent a lot of good hands
to church.

1033
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:03,288
Made more than one cowboy
do a little praying.

1034
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:07,158
Well, sir, I wanted to draw
on that bull the whole year.

1035
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:08,787
And don't you know...

1036
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,422
when we got to
the Madison Square Garden...

1037
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:12,763
by God, I got him.

1038
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,994
I told Mr. Jack Dempsey...

1039
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:15,969
in this restaurant
the night before...

1040
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:18,370
we was introduced
as one champ to another...

1041
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:21,603
I told him if he wanted
to see a real fight...

1042
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:26,103
he ought to see me and that bull
go eight seconds.

1043
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:30,049
Well, I rode that bull...

1044
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:32,882
and after eight seconds...

1045
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:36,857
there were
16,423 big city dudes...

1046
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:40,452
standing on their feet
and hollering my name.

1047
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:46,229
That was the last time, though.

1048
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:51,699
Ellie? Excuse me, boys.

1049
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:55,240
Ellie, where you going?

1050
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:00,080
Did you hear me, Ellie?

1051
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:01,809
I asked you
where you were going.

1052
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:04,113
To get some air.

1053
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:06,245
Now, wait on me, honey.

1054
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,720
I want to talk with you.

1055
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,954
By hook or by crook,
I'm going to Australia.

1056
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:17,931
Well, you always were good
at putting distance between us.

1057
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:19,558
Now, look, honey...

1058
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:21,967
don't turn your back on me.

1059
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:25,871
I'm askin', what's a man to do?

1060
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:30,173
Silver all shot to hell,
no more bounty on the lions.

1061
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:34,580
Hey, you know, you could
go down there with me.

1062
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:38,712
Ace, why don't you
just shut up?

1063
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:44,851
She's sure got a case
of the knits, don't she?

1064
01:27:44,892 --> 01:27:46,291
Australia.

1065
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:47,726
Silver in Nevada.

1066
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:49,389
You are a broken record, Ace.

1067
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:50,454
Now, quiet down, honey.

1068
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:52,193
We don't want our wash
hung out in public.

1069
01:27:52,233 --> 01:27:53,860
Why the hell should I be quiet?

1070
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:56,597
- Now, listen, honey...
- You listen...

1071
01:27:56,638 --> 01:27:58,936
'cause I just don't
give a damn anymore.

1072
01:27:58,973 --> 01:28:00,600
As far as I'm concerned...

1073
01:28:00,642 --> 01:28:05,944
you can go to hell
or Australia, but not with me.

1074
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,743
Well, they're both
down under.

1075
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:18,650
Dreams, sweet talk...

1076
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:19,927
that's all you are.

1077
01:28:28,169 --> 01:28:30,501
If you stay with me...

1078
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:32,733
I'll sweeten the dreams, too.

1079
01:28:32,774 --> 01:28:34,765
Remember?

1080
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:51,057
Well, sure as hell,
I had that coming.

1081
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:53,925
You sure as hell did.

1082
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:59,963
But I'm leaving
for good, Ellie...

1083
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,662
and I mean it this time.

1084
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:14,308
Then all we got left is today.

1085
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:18,817
Well, anyway, Ellie...

1086
01:29:21,255 --> 01:29:23,621
you seen one rodeo,
you seen 'em all.

1087
01:29:25,126 --> 01:29:27,287
Yeah. Sure.

1088
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:09,932
The time for Billy Longer
and C.T. Jones...

1089
01:30:09,971 --> 01:30:14,203
16 and 4/10 seconds.
16.4.

1090
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,794
Our next ropers...

1091
01:30:40,835 --> 01:30:42,928
a pair of Casa Grande,
Arizona cowboys...

1092
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:47,270
Jim Carter and Paul Arnold,
looking to beat 16.4.

1093
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:00,320
Bring the bulls on!

1094
01:31:00,354 --> 01:31:04,950
The winning time so far,
15 and 3/10 seconds.

1095
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:09,554
15.3 for Jim Carter
and Paul Arnold.

1096
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:11,394
Get him in there!

1097
01:31:11,432 --> 01:31:13,730
Next up, Bob Malone
of Mayer, Arizona...

1098
01:31:13,768 --> 01:31:16,601
and Al Gardner
of Dewey, Arizona.

1099
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:41,088
Let's go, J.R.

1100
01:31:41,128 --> 01:31:42,595
Our final pair
of ropers in team tying...

1101
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:44,655
Henry Thompson
of Florence, Arizona...

1102
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:46,394
B.W. White of Phoenix.

1103
01:31:56,844 --> 01:31:58,277
Well, you couldn't
make it much closer.

1104
01:31:58,312 --> 01:32:02,339
15 and 4/10 seconds.

1105
01:32:02,383 --> 01:32:04,783
Better pull your hat
down today, pard.

1106
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:08,118
We'll move along to the final
event on today's program...

1107
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:11,921
bull riding, the most
dangerous event in rodeo.

1108
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:13,790
In order to qualify
for prize money...

1109
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:16,626
the cowboy must stay aboard
a twisting half-ton of fury...

1110
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:18,291
for eight seconds.

1111
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:22,526
You know, successful
or thrown in his ride...

1112
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:23,867
the safety
of our bull riders today...

1113
01:32:23,905 --> 01:32:26,772
may well depend on the daring
of our rodeo clowns.

1114
01:32:28,009 --> 01:32:29,408
Scoring in this event
is similar...

1115
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:30,967
to saddle and bareback
bronc riding.

1116
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:33,981
Our 2 judges can score
up to 25 points...

1117
01:32:34,015 --> 01:32:36,677
on the performance
of the bull and the cowboy.

1118
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:41,946
First place money, $950.

1119
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:45,618
OK, the boys in the chutes
say they're ready to go.

1120
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:54,999
Hold on, J.R.!

1121
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:43,880
Well, that's
the luck of the draw, Bob.

1122
01:33:43,918 --> 01:33:47,820
Speaking of luck,
it's J.R. Bonner's luck...

1123
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:50,323
to have drawn the country's
number one bucking bull...

1124
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:53,191
undefeated in 29 rides...

1125
01:33:53,227 --> 01:33:57,061
the 29th of which was,
you guessed it, J.R. Bonner.

1126
01:33:57,098 --> 01:33:59,566
Four days later, right here
in his hometown of Prescott...

1127
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,591
this former
bull riding champion...

1128
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:02,898
is now back
to try Buck Roan's...

1129
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:10,936
Old J.R. Bonner
on Old Sunshine.

1130
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:40,406
Come on!

1131
01:35:10,171 --> 01:35:13,538
How about that ride, folks?
J.R. Has done it.

1132
01:35:13,574 --> 01:35:16,202
He's the first man ever
to ride Old Sunshine...

1133
01:35:16,243 --> 01:35:18,370
and a dandy ride it was.

1134
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:30,051
Well, our rodeo judges
scored 92 points on that ride...

1135
01:35:30,091 --> 01:35:32,321
92 points for J.R. Bonner.

1136
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:37,922
That's going to make him
about $950 richer.

1137
01:35:37,965 --> 01:35:40,229
Folks, that's
the last ride of the day.

1138
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:42,735
- That was a hell of a ride, J.R.
- Well, it's about time.

1139
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,101
This was some way to end...

1140
01:35:44,138 --> 01:35:47,266
the 84th annual
Frontier Days Rodeo.

1141
01:35:47,308 --> 01:35:49,902
I think you'll agree with me
that after 84 years...

1142
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:52,742
they still make cowboys
as tough as they ever did.

1143
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:54,543
We'd like to thank
the Prescott...

1144
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,579
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

1145
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:39,252
Chaparral airlines flight 417
for Phoenix and Tucson...

1146
01:36:39,293 --> 01:36:40,658
is now boarding.

1147
01:36:40,694 --> 01:36:44,790
Passengers holding tickets may
board through gate number five.

1148
01:36:44,832 --> 01:36:46,265
Passengers holding space...

1149
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,996
on the continuation
of flight 417...

1150
01:36:49,036 --> 01:36:50,833
please have your tickets
ready at the gate.

1151
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:52,270
Rodeo time.

1152
01:36:52,306 --> 01:36:54,638
I got to get it
on down the road.

1153
01:36:56,143 --> 01:36:57,542
So long.

1154
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:11,758
Ma?

1155
01:37:15,796 --> 01:37:17,229
Ma?

1156
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:27,162
Junior.

1157
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:33,503
You had to win, didn't you?

1158
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:36,280
Yeah.

1159
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:41,321
So long, Mom.

1160
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:03,999
Hey, Junior! Junior!

1161
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:07,241
Hey, Junior!
Don't you hear me, boy?

1162
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:18,653
I'm sure you're going
to enjoy yourself. Thank you.

1163
01:38:18,692 --> 01:38:19,784
Good morning.

1164
01:38:19,827 --> 01:38:22,295
I'd like a one-way ticket
to Sydney, Australia...

1165
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:23,626
a man and a dog.

1166
01:38:23,664 --> 01:38:24,756
All right.

1167
01:38:38,345 --> 01:38:42,679
Economy will cost you $585...

1168
01:38:42,716 --> 01:38:46,379
and first class is $798...

1169
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:48,183
plus $40 for the animal.

1170
01:38:52,293 --> 01:38:55,660
- Write it first class.
- All right.

1171
01:38:57,031 --> 01:38:59,056
Put that in the name
of Mr. Ace Bonner.

1172
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:03,596
And you can have it delivered
to him at the Palace bar.

1173
01:39:03,637 --> 01:39:05,400
All right.

1174
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:07,669
Here's your money.

1175
01:39:07,708 --> 01:39:10,506
Who shall we say
paid for the ticket?

1176
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:13,308
Tell 'em Junior sent you.
