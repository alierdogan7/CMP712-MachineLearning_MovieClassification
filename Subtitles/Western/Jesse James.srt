1
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:48,816
Now, listen, friend. The railroad's
gonna come right smack through your land

2
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,517
and there ain't a thing you can do to stop it.

3
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:56,041
But, mister, a dollar an acre.
I paid $15 an acre for it.

4
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:59,143
And then there's my home
and the barn and the crop.

5
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:01,212
Take it or leave it, friend.

6
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:04,440
But if you won't sell,
we'll call in the government.

7
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:07,669
They'll confiscate your land
and you'll get nothin'.

8
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,414
But if that's the way you want it...

9
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:15,570
- What'll I do?
- I don't know.

10
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:19,620
- Mister. Mister!
- Here he comes.

11
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,641
- Mister...
- Well?

12
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:25,795
I reckon, if that's the way
they're gonna do it...

13
00:02:25,883 --> 00:02:28,374
Now you're talkin' sense.

14
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:31,481
- Can you write?
- No, sir.

15
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:35,271
Here. Put your mark right there.

16
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:44,192
I'm telling you, lady. If you won't sell,
the government'll take it.

17
00:02:44,283 --> 00:02:46,947
You can save a lot of trouble
by signing now.

18
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:51,543
It's so little - $2 an acre.

19
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:56,192
But if that's the way it is.

20
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:59,416
Don't sign it, Ma. Please don't.
Let's see a lawyer first.

21
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:02,930
- You're wasting your time, son.
- Let's see one anyway, Ma.

22
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:06,637
We can go to town and see Judge Harvey.
He'll tell you what to do.

23
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:10,033
- Wait till you see him. Please.
- Right here, ma'am.

24
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:14,029
I suppose it can't hurt
to talk to somebody first.

25
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:17,584
You don't mind waiting
till tomorrow, do you?

26
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,666
Well, it won't do you any good,
but whatever you say, ma'am.

27
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,233
No hard feelings, son.

28
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:29,862
Why, no, sir.

29
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,978
Tryin' to hold us up?

30
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:37,329
- Tryin' to jack up the price, are you?
- Leave him alone!

31
00:03:37,412 --> 00:03:40,269
No, no, please!
Leave him alone! Don't hurt him!

32
00:03:40,356 --> 00:03:43,546
- I'll sign. I will, right now.
- Don't sign it, Ma.

33
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:46,042
I will.

34
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:48,175
Right there, ma'am.

35
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:00,809
Howdy, bud.

36
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:04,818
Sir?

37
00:04:04,904 --> 00:04:06,673
I just said howdy.

38
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:09,365
Howdy.

39
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,499
- What's your name?
- James. Jesse James.

40
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:18,168
- You own this farm?
- No, but my ma does.

41
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,874
- Where is she?
- Up at the house.

42
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,053
Thanks, bud.

43
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,494
Morning.

44
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:55,071
Good morning, ma'am.

45
00:04:57,374 --> 00:05:00,601
- Are you the lady that owns this farm?
- Yes, I am.

46
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:05,520
My name's Barshee. I'm with the railroad.
We're comin' through this way, you know.

47
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,464
I heard so.

48
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:12,258
I wanna get this deed signed up.
If you'll just put your name right there.

49
00:05:12,347 --> 00:05:14,884
- For nothing?
- No, no.

50
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:18,161
We're payin' $1 an acre,
just like to everybody else.

51
00:05:18,244 --> 00:05:20,543
Everybody's gettin' the same thing.

52
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:23,085
Seems mighty little, don't it?

53
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,574
I can't help that, lady. That's all you'll get,
so you might as well sign up now.

54
00:05:27,656 --> 00:05:30,226
You mean right this minute?

55
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:33,459
Look, lady. We ain't got
all day to hang around here.

56
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:38,501
You either take what I'm offering or you'll
get nothing. We get your land just the same.

57
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:43,871
I wouldn't dream of signing a thing like that
without talking to some lawyer about it.

58
00:05:43,963 --> 00:05:47,218
Are you gonna waste my time
with some jackleg lawyer?

59
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:49,479
Your land's the same as anybody else's.

60
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:54,405
Well, there's no use talking.
I'm not gonna sign that thing right now.

61
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:57,065
Lady, I don't wanna
have any trouble with you.

62
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:01,481
Didn't you hear her say no?
Said she wasn't gonna sign.

63
00:06:01,563 --> 00:06:05,393
- Who are you?
- That's my son, Frank.

64
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:07,969
Well, you're so smart,

65
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,254
how would you like the government
to condemn this land and take it for nothing?

66
00:06:12,335 --> 00:06:14,155
Wouldn't like it.

67
00:06:14,237 --> 00:06:18,510
You better understand that I'm doing you
a favour when I offer a dollar an acre.

68
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:20,685
We don't want no favours.

69
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:25,178
- Maybe you'd like to go to court about it.
- Might at that.

70
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:29,847
Well, you folks have it your own way.

71
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:34,814
All right, son. No hard feelings.

72
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:36,675
Frank!

73
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:41,798
Kinda tricky, ain't you?

74
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,851
Yeah.

75
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:49,150
- Get him, boys.
- No, Frank! Frank!

76
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:51,279
I ain't a-scared.

77
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,010
You ain't gonna all jump on him, are you?

78
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:03,192
Back against the wall, you fellas.
Hands out of your pockets.

79
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:05,500
- Wanna fight him, Frank?
- Frank, don't.

80
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:10,096
- If you keep them others off my back.
- They won't do anything, will you, fellas?

81
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,406
- Jesse, stop him. Stop him.
- Sorry, Ma. He started it.

82
00:07:13,494 --> 00:07:16,684
Please, Jesse. Don't let him.

83
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,228
Frank!

84
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:30,284
Jesse, stop 'em. Stop 'em!

85
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:39,128
He's gonna get hurt.

86
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:50,585
Looks to me like he's got enough.

87
00:07:50,676 --> 00:07:54,299
- Who's next?
- Think you can lick 'em all, Frank?

88
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,742
I'll fight 'em or wrestle 'em one at a time
and pile 'em up under the tree.

89
00:07:58,824 --> 00:08:01,969
You'll do nothing of the kind.
You men, get away from here!

90
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:03,702
Jess!

91
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:07,734
Well, if he ain't the tricky one.

92
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:10,157
Get off this land, all of you!

93
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:13,151
Move along.

94
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:16,177
And jump!

95
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:25,590
But we're still gonna get this land
just the same.

96
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,564
Jesse!

97
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:34,552
- I'm all right, son.
- What happened?

98
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:37,331
- I don't know. It went black...
- Come in the house.

99
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,060
- What happened?
- She fainted.

100
00:08:39,148 --> 00:08:42,534
- I didn't. I just gotta lay down.
- You better get Doc Hall.

101
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,716
Pinkie!

102
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:48,555
- Pinkie!
- Yes, sir?

103
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,256
Get on your mule and go after Doc Hall.

104
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:53,596
- Yes, sir.
- And, Pinkie...

105
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:56,302
Then get to all the farmers
this side of Liberty -

106
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:58,845
Mr Crump, Mr Clayton, Mr Thompson -
all of them.

107
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,707
Tell 'em there's an important meeting
here tonight.

108
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:05,223
- Tell 'em to come without fail.
- Yes, sir.

109
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,648
And furthermore...

110
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,263
if the St Louis Midland

111
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:24,235
don't know the way its agents
are swindlin' the farmers,

112
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,357
it's high time they found out...

113
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:32,475
Comma.

114
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:38,208
...because it's the goldangedest,
dad-blastedest, con-sangedest outrage

115
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:44,583
ever perpetrated on a law-abiding citizenry
in the whole history of the world.

116
00:09:44,673 --> 00:09:47,164
Paragraph.

117
00:09:55,283 --> 00:09:57,776
Trouble, by gravy.

118
00:09:58,718 --> 00:10:00,168
Uncle Rufe...

119
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:04,607
- You want me to take those cusswords out?
- I guess so.

120
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:12,397
You want to swear out warrants
for their arrest?

121
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:16,108
I'm charging Frank and Jesse James
with assault with attempt to murder.

122
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,609
- Too bad they didn't finish it.
- Jesse?

123
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,033
Yes. While my back was turned.

124
00:10:21,124 --> 00:10:23,166
Nice shootin'.

125
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:28,711
If you'll swear in me and my men as deputies,
we won't bother you any more.

126
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,852
We'll bring in these buckaroos ourselves.
Tonight.

127
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:38,061
- It's Jesse. He's in trouble.
- No! What did he do?

128
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:39,734
Uncle Rufe!

129
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:44,120
You know them cusswords I told you
to take out? Put 'em back in.

130
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:50,376
Uncle Rufe! Uncle Rufe!

131
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:54,371
What we gotta do is chip in some money -
whatever we can afford -

132
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,678
and send down to St Louis for a lawyer.

133
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:59,829
We bought our land, built our homes
and raised our crops.

134
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:02,487
If we give 'em up,
we got a right to a fair price.

135
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,904
You're right.

136
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,820
- We don't want any trouble, Jesse.
- Not unless they start it, Ma.

137
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:11,689
We need somebody that knows the law
to tell us how to protect our rights.

138
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,050
- Jesse's right. We need a lawyer.
- Jesse! Frank!

139
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,721
Jesse! Frank!

140
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:22,835
Jesse! Frank!

141
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:27,193
You boys must get outta here. They got
a warrant and they're headed here now.

142
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:30,303
You got to skip out.
I told Pinkie to get your horses ready.

143
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,961
- Nobody going to arrest me.
- I ain't gonna run.

144
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:36,723
- Now, listen...
- Listen to the major, Frank.

145
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:40,840
You ain't got a chance. The St Louis Midland's
got this whole state hogtied.

146
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,086
They got the police, the courts, everything.
A trial now would be ajoke.

147
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:49,076
The railroad has too much at stake
to let two farmer boys bollix things up.

148
00:11:49,162 --> 00:11:51,061
- We can defend ourselves.
- Jesse...

149
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:54,158
- Well, sure, Ma.
- Do what the major says. He's right.

150
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:58,889
You just gotta hide out till I can get the
governor or somebody to give you a fair trial.

151
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:02,068
- If we run away...
- Jesse, please go like the major says.

152
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:06,956
If you don't, it'll mean trouble.
I couldn't stand it. I'm not well enough.

153
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,975
- Massa Frank.
- Please go.

154
00:12:09,064 --> 00:12:12,044
The horses are ready at the back gate.

155
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:15,396
All right, Ma, if it makes you feel better.

156
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:18,222
- Be awful careful, son.
- Don't worry, Ma.

157
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,530
- Take care of him, Frank.
- Yes, Ma.

158
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:23,676
- Bye, Jesse.
- Bye, Frank.

159
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,818
- Goodbye, Ma.
- Pinkie'll know where we are.

160
00:12:30,497 --> 00:12:31,697
Pinkie...

161
00:12:31,788 --> 00:12:34,087
Yes, I knows where it is.

162
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:38,353
Be careful, boys. Be careful.

163
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:58,870
Now, ladies, you all
go down the road a piece and wait.

164
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,179
There's apt to be a fracas here.
Just let us men handle it.

165
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:05,614
Step along. Just get right down there.

166
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,561
Now, men, listen to me.
Let me do all the talkin'.

167
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:15,056
Yes, Major.

168
00:13:15,147 --> 00:13:17,539
Here they come.

169
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:25,873
Evening, gentlemen.

170
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,575
- Where's the James boys?
- We got a warrant.

171
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:31,967
They're gone. And if you want to know
who got 'em away, 'twas me!

172
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:35,408
- Easy, Major.
- Get out of the way.

173
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:39,193
Just a minute, Mr Barshee.
You have my word for it, the boys are gone.

174
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:41,538
Your word...

175
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:45,933
Come out, Frank and Jesse James,
or we'll pull you out.

176
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:50,186
Their mother's sick in bed and her heart
won't stand you mules in the house.

177
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:53,645
- Are you gonna let him make a fool of you?
- He says they ain't there.

178
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:55,789
- They ain't!
- I can find that out.

179
00:13:55,873 --> 00:13:57,966
Lynch! Bring me that mushmelon.

180
00:13:58,055 --> 00:14:01,151
Major!

181
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,439
He's tellin' the truth.

182
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,039
If you ain't out of there in one minute,
I'll blow you out.

183
00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:07,706
Do you think I'm lyin'?

184
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:11,933
Major! They can come in. Let 'em...

185
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:19,283
- Look! There's somebody in there.
- It's their mother, I tell you.

186
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:41,398
There's no use. She's dead.

187
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:45,192
This is bad. Mighty bad.

188
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,708
I'm sure sorry.

189
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:52,462
Well, I'm sorry too.

190
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:57,348
I wasn't talkin' about her. She's gone.

191
00:14:57,432 --> 00:14:59,923
It's you I'm sorry for.

192
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:22,655
Zee!

193
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,860
Frank!

194
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:26,451
- Frank!
- Yeah?

195
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:28,628
- It's Zee.
- Zee?

196
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,169
- I can hardly believe my eyes.
- Zee!

197
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:37,472
- Frank.
- How are you, Zee?

198
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,668
- I've worried so about you all.
- About us?

199
00:15:41,762 --> 00:15:44,697
How's everybody?
How's everything at home? How's Ma?

200
00:15:44,784 --> 00:15:47,197
Jesse...

201
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:49,745
Ma? What happened?

202
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:53,334
Barshee...

203
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:57,930
You mean she's dead?

204
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:03,666
Oh, Jesse...

205
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,975
Well, let's go.

206
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:15,903
Bye, honey.

207
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:18,527
- Jesse, don't you go.
- I've got to.

208
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:20,865
Oh, no, Jesse. Please.

209
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:23,696
I can't help it, Zee. I just got to.

210
00:16:23,777 --> 00:16:26,634
- Let Frank.
- Sorry, honey.

211
00:16:26,758 --> 00:16:28,654
Frank, make him.

212
00:16:28,743 --> 00:16:31,680
- Take care of her.
- What about me?

213
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:34,099
I'm the one he did it to, cos I shot him.

214
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:36,726
Go ahead. If you don't get him, I will.

215
00:16:36,853 --> 00:16:39,065
It might be a long time
before I see you, Zee.

216
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:40,849
I can wait.

217
00:16:40,937 --> 00:16:44,033
- Goodbye, honey.
- Goodbye, Jesse.

218
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:10,655
Just keep anybody
from bothering me, that's all.

219
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,293
Boys, the dust speaks for itself.
I'm used to it.

220
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,698
Keep your hands in sight.

221
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:33,369
Bartender, count three and duck.

222
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:34,702
Yes, sir.

223
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:38,092
Wait a minute, Jesse.
It was an accident, I swear it was.

224
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:39,336
Count.

225
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,285
No, no. I can explain it.
I didn't know she was there, I swear it.

226
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:45,670
Keep your hands in sight. One.

227
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:47,773
No. No! Jesse!

228
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:50,440
Two.

229
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:52,610
Now stand still.

230
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:56,767
One, two, three, four, five.

231
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,603
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- All aboard!

232
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:04,388
All aboard!

233
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:08,842
Hands up!

234
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:12,270
Keep right on driving until I tell you to stop.

235
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,904
- What are you aiming to do, pardner?
- I ain't aiming to do nothin'.

236
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:20,318
- I'm doin' it. I'm holdin' up this train.
- The whole train?

237
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:27,777
Slack up at this next curve. Stop herjust this
side of that clump of trees around the bend.

238
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:30,438
It's your funeral, pardner.

239
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,160
Unhitch it.

240
00:21:59,793 --> 00:22:02,906
If you don't know what this is, folks,
it's a hold-up.

241
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,002
Stay in your seats!
Keep your hands in sight.

242
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,086
And the gent who throwed his pocketbook in
the spittoon will kindly take it out and wipe it.

243
00:22:11,176 --> 00:22:14,639
- No jewellery, folks. Just cash.
- That's every cent I've got.

244
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:17,222
You shouldn't ride on
the St Louis Midland Railroad.

245
00:22:17,313 --> 00:22:19,883
No jewellery, thank you just the same.

246
00:22:19,975 --> 00:22:22,786
That's very nice, sir.
A fine-lookin' pocketbook.

247
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,752
Thank you, lady. Don't forget to sue
the railroad for all you give us,

248
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:29,700
cos it's responsible.
Thank you very kindly, sir.

249
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:33,615
Just drop it in the sack and nobody'll get hurt.
Thank you, brother.

250
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,760
Have your wallets ready.

251
00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:38,585
Thank you, brother. Don't take all day.

252
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:42,257
- Sit down.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you kindly.

253
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:49,759
- You'll hear about this.
- No back talk. Thank you, brother.

254
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:58,807
Everybody sit quiet and nobody'll get hurt.
Let's go. Lights out.

255
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:28,598
Then he stuck a pistol
as big as a cannon right there

256
00:23:28,682 --> 00:23:31,715
and says, "Brother, we want that mail safe."

257
00:23:31,797 --> 00:23:35,490
Where was the protection we're entitled to?
Where was the law?

258
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,863
Just a minute, cap. I'm the law in Liberty.
I don't cover the whole United States.

259
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:44,182
- If you give me a description of these men...
- You know as well as I do who it was.

260
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:48,980
Jesse James. Who else picks on my road?
Who else would have the nerve?

261
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:53,092
Sure it was, but you don't
have to yell about it. I'm not deaf.

262
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,581
What's that?

263
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,081
Look! It's him!

264
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:28,628
- Well, you crazy son of a gun.
- How are you, Major?

265
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,492
You're asking to be caught.
They're looking all over the county for you.

266
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,228
How about a cup of coffee?

267
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:39,727
- The marshal's got 30 men looking for you.
- In all this rain, too. Poor boys.

268
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:43,436
- It's no joke, Jesse.
- It's all right, honey. I won't stay long.

269
00:24:43,526 --> 00:24:48,283
The way I figure it out, as long as they're
out there, in here's the safest place for me.

270
00:24:48,372 --> 00:24:52,440
- Sit down. Leave the man alone.
- But he's taking chances.

271
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:56,639
If I could just think of some way
to let you know how wrong you are.

272
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,708
It's no use, honey. It's like I always told you.

273
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:03,097
I hate the railroads.
And when I hate I have to do something.

274
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:05,272
That's the stuff.

275
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:08,824
People ain't hatin' now
like they used to. They're gettin' soft.

276
00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:12,345
I gotta admit that I like a man
that hates good and hard.

277
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:16,018
It's the lawyers, goldang it,
a-messin' up the whole world.

278
00:25:16,102 --> 00:25:20,170
Ten years ago here in Liberty, we didn't
have no lawyers and we got along fine.

279
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:25,298
A man killed somebody, somebody killed
him, the marshal shot 'em all. That was it.

280
00:25:25,383 --> 00:25:29,821
But look at it today. Here in Liberty we got
hundreds of lawyers, thousands of 'em.

281
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:32,445
As far as the eye can see,
nothin' but lawyers.

282
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,675
Uncle Rufe, there are only
two lawyers in Liberty.

283
00:25:35,806 --> 00:25:40,157
Two? Is that all?
Then they run around too much.

284
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:43,376
Goldang it. I'm gonna write me
an editorial about that.

285
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:45,038
- Roy!
- Yes, sir.

286
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:47,616
Take an editorial on lawyers.

287
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,543
- Liars?
- That'll do. We'll begin easy.

288
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,903
Paragraph.

289
00:25:55,987 --> 00:26:01,507
If we are ever to have
law and order in the West,

290
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:07,208
the first thing we got to do
is take out all the lawyers

291
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:09,827
and shoot 'em down like dogs.

292
00:26:12,815 --> 00:26:13,937
Paragraph.

293
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:17,571
They're bound to get you some day, Jesse.

294
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:27,704
That's why I hate to see you
go out that door.

295
00:26:28,764 --> 00:26:33,037
Because I keep thinking of you
all the time out there in the hills.

296
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,423
Just going on and on to nowhere.

297
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,811
Just trying to keep alive.

298
00:26:39,987 --> 00:26:45,506
And everybody after you,
wanting to kill you to get that money.

299
00:26:45,593 --> 00:26:51,127
And, Jesse, sometimes at night
when it's cold and raining,

300
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,906
I wake up crying,

301
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:58,345
because in a dream
I saw you lying dead in the mud.

302
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:01,048
Oh, Jesse, I'm so scared.

303
00:27:05,815 --> 00:27:10,458
You're the only one that it matters to, Zee,
one way or the other,

304
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:14,482
You're the only one
that means anything to me.

305
00:27:14,574 --> 00:27:18,932
I know it was a fool thing to come here, but...

306
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,449
I never knew how much I did want to see you

307
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:24,577
until I saw you.

308
00:27:30,323 --> 00:27:34,708
...the dad-blamedest outrage ever...

309
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:36,777
How are you, Horace Greeley?

310
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,681
Hello, Will.

311
00:27:40,813 --> 00:27:43,766
- I thought you was...
- I was.

312
00:27:43,848 --> 00:27:47,067
- Is Zee inside?
- Well, she's...

313
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:49,937
- Evening, Zee.
- Evening, Will.

314
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:54,617
- I thought you went out with the posse.
- I did. I just got back.

315
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,793
Did you catch him?

316
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:05,790
This is Mr Howard, Will.
Mr Thomas Howard, an old friend of ours.

317
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:07,976
This is the US marshal, Mr Wright.

318
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:10,920
- How do you do, Mr Howard?
- How do you do?

319
00:28:11,007 --> 00:28:17,100
- Mr Howard's from St Louis.
- Yes? I used to live in St Louis.

320
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:23,118
- What business are you in, Mr Howard?
- Guns. Guns and horses.

321
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,296
Guns and horses, eh?

322
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:29,417
No, we didn't catch him.
You couldn't find a white elephant tonight.

323
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:33,441
Zee used to know Jesse James.
She tell you? They kinda grew up together.

324
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:36,359
She's told me so much
I almost feel I know him myself.

325
00:28:36,446 --> 00:28:38,617
You do?

326
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:42,162
Good biscuits. You make 'em, Zee?

327
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:44,347
Try one, Mr Howard.

328
00:28:48,629 --> 00:28:51,423
I don't mean that we ain't after him.

329
00:28:51,504 --> 00:28:55,536
I'm still a peace officer. If we ever
come on each other in the right place,

330
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:58,554
it's just gonna be me or him -
one or the other.

331
00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:01,052
Yes, I understand.

332
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:05,902
I'm hoping he'll stop messing around
in my district or else keep out of my way,

333
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:09,534
cos it'll save Zee some hurt. Either way.

334
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:13,694
- You know yourjob, I guess.
- I know it and I'm good at it.

335
00:29:13,777 --> 00:29:16,236
I'm just as good at my job as he is at his.

336
00:29:16,324 --> 00:29:20,189
That's why I say the next time
I'll blow his head off or he'll blow mine.

337
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:23,955
I got some business up the road a piece.
Take me about an hour.

338
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,532
- Maybe I'll drop in later if your light's on.
- All right, Will.

339
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:31,453
- Good night, Horace Greeley.
- Good night, Will.

340
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,856
I don't expect I'll be seeing you again.

341
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:39,204
No, I don't expect so.

342
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:42,634
Take care of yourself.

343
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:57,810
- You got a better grade of law here now.
- Don't waste time, Jesse. Go now.

344
00:29:58,828 --> 00:30:01,286
I think I'd better go that way.

345
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:08,757
- Blow out the light. I don't wanna be a target.
- Yes.

346
00:30:16,598 --> 00:30:18,642
All clear.

347
00:30:38,593 --> 00:30:41,163
Is that why you won't marry me?

348
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:46,130
I can't help it, Will.

349
00:30:56,233 --> 00:31:00,174
Well, let's load him on a horse
and take him to town.

350
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:17,662
One of you fellas come and give me a hand.

351
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:20,540
Get back out of the way, you young ones.

352
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:23,283
Get over on the other side.

353
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:26,138
- Is that...
- No, ma'am.

354
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:29,282
We didn't get the jackpot this time.

355
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:34,086
They keep running up that price and one
of Jesse's own men will take a shot at him.

356
00:31:34,182 --> 00:31:41,082
Some of them fellas would scalp
their own ma for a lot less than $5,000.

357
00:31:42,094 --> 00:31:44,251
Let him down on this side.

358
00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:56,848
- Darling...
- Are you really as pretty as I think?

359
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,450
Jesse, read this. Read it.

360
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:06,464
Will arranged it. I asked him to.

361
00:32:07,642 --> 00:32:10,463
- I can't do that, Zee.
- Why not?

362
00:32:11,117 --> 00:32:13,733
I trust Will, but...

363
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:18,621
He's given his word, he's promised.
He'll see that it works out all right.

364
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:20,554
Jesse, listen.

365
00:32:20,687 --> 00:32:24,596
It isn't only now, although that's bad enough.

366
00:32:24,682 --> 00:32:29,226
It's what's going to happen to you.
Inside of you.

367
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:31,410
You understand?

368
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:37,274
I mean... Right now you're a hero to yourself
and a lot of other people too.

369
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:41,263
It's a fight you're in
and it's the railroad that started it.

370
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:44,251
But that's not going to last, Jesse.

371
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:47,046
The more luck you have, the worse you'll get.

372
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:50,142
Shooting and robbing -
it'll get in your blood, Jesse.

373
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:55,590
You'll get like a wolf.
Just doing it because it's your nature.

374
00:32:55,717 --> 00:33:00,158
That'll be your appetite -
for shooting and robbing.

375
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,733
Until something happens to you.

376
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:07,265
And if anything ever happened to you, Jesse,

377
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:10,444
it'd be like it was happening to me too.

378
00:33:11,543 --> 00:33:15,088
Oh, darling, there's only one way out.

379
00:33:15,178 --> 00:33:17,794
Come in. Give up.

380
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:21,589
Let me draw a free breath again.

381
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:33,741
I can't, Zee. I'd go crazy in prison.

382
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,419
I couldn't do it.

383
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:41,245
But if we went away now...

384
00:33:41,337 --> 00:33:44,112
That's all there is to it, Jesse.

385
00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:47,346
Goodbye.

386
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:51,057
- But, Zee, please...
- Good luck.

387
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,344
Zee, you said you'd wait.

388
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:07,970
However long it took.

389
00:34:08,056 --> 00:34:12,972
- Would you marry me now, before?
- Today, if you want me to.

390
00:34:13,062 --> 00:34:16,892
- Then that's the way, I guess.
- The only way.

391
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,842
And then the prodigal son

392
00:34:58,923 --> 00:35:02,064
come home to his ma and pa.

393
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,205
- Welcome, brothers and sister.
- Thank you, sir.

394
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:15,064
Sit down. Just find a seat anywhere.

395
00:35:17,493 --> 00:35:19,457
Could we get hitched?

396
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,126
Married.

397
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:29,844
- You ain't eloping, are you?
- How's that?

398
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:34,162
- No, sir. I'm grown.
- We're in a hurry, if you don't mind.

399
00:35:34,243 --> 00:35:35,283
Your brothers?

400
00:35:35,374 --> 00:35:37,615
- I have no brothers.
- Sorry.

401
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,175
- What's your name, sister?
- Zerelda Cobb.

402
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,637
- And yours, son?
- Jesse Woodson James.

403
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:46,023
Jesse Wood... Jesse James?

404
00:35:46,107 --> 00:35:48,199
- Thank the Lord.
- Sit down.

405
00:35:48,288 --> 00:35:51,340
- Yes, sir. We don't want no trouble.
- Trouble?

406
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:56,404
Why, son, you're as welcome
as rain to the flowers.

407
00:35:56,489 --> 00:36:02,131
Do you realise, boy, that I had
a farm giving 900 bushels of corn

408
00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:04,992
until that railroad had taken it from me?

409
00:36:05,074 --> 00:36:10,687
Why, I'd given up preaching and
was making an honest living off the land

410
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:15,655
until that dad-swinged railroad
swindled me out of my own home.

411
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:19,522
- That's true, Mr James.
- By golly, son!

412
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:22,445
Do you know, I had a big house,

413
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:25,821
two barns, three outhouses,

414
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,428
until that goldanged railroad
hornswoggled me?

415
00:36:30,516 --> 00:36:33,007
- Amen.
- Amen.

416
00:36:33,098 --> 00:36:36,331
All right. We're gathered here

417
00:36:36,453 --> 00:36:40,440
to join Zerelda Cobb
and Jesse Woodson James

418
00:36:40,526 --> 00:36:42,733
in the bonds of holy matrimony...

419
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:52,793
- Howdy, Jesse.
- Howdy, Will.

420
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:59,778
- I guess Zee explained things.
- She said they're willing to go light.

421
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:04,739
They're so glad to get rid of you, they're liable
to make you a conductor on the road.

422
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:08,015
- What do you think I'll get?
- Two, three years.

423
00:37:08,098 --> 00:37:09,980
Maybe five. It won't be much.

424
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:14,746
All they're charging you with is that depot
at Pine Hills that you knocked over.

425
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:17,326
That one they got proof on.

426
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:21,402
I'm much obliged for all you've done, Will.

427
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:23,547
Don't mention it.

428
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:27,548
Shall we go?

429
00:37:47,451 --> 00:37:49,546
Is it all right, Jesse?

430
00:38:06,302 --> 00:38:09,003
- Howdy, Jesse.
- Howdy, Jesse.

431
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:11,868
- Howdy, Jesse.
- Howdy. Judge.

432
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,043
- Jesse.
- Major.

433
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:19,501
- You ain't got no more guns, have you?
- No.

434
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:20,629
All right.

435
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,052
- You're doing the wise thing, son.
- Am I?

436
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:26,720
Judge Mathews is gonna try your case, son.
You can trust him.

437
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,182
I'm aiming to go as light as the law allows.

438
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:32,905
When you come out, the slate will be clean.
The past will be forgotten.

439
00:38:33,032 --> 00:38:36,938
- Thank you, Judge.
- Well, Jesse, if you're ready.

440
00:38:37,027 --> 00:38:38,105
Well, I...

441
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,905
All right, Jesse. Go ahead.

442
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:53,373
- You ain't worried, are you, kid?
- I could do it on my head.

443
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,543
Good boy.

444
00:39:01,446 --> 00:39:05,387
Oh, my darling. My wife.

445
00:39:05,518 --> 00:39:07,572
My husband.

446
00:39:11,056 --> 00:39:13,718
Oh, I'm proud of you, dear.

447
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:16,095
Proud of you.

448
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:20,288
Bye, Zee. Goodbye.

449
00:39:27,924 --> 00:39:30,415
I'll be waiting.

450
00:40:06,157 --> 00:40:08,649
Yes, sir. You can go right in.

451
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,870
Mr James?

452
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:20,151
- I'm Mr McCoy, president of the railroad.
- I know who you are, Mr McCoy.

453
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:25,720
I just want to welcome you and tell you
how glad I am to see you here in jail.

454
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:03,709
- From here...
- What's all this soldier business?

455
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:06,168
This is Mr Wright, the peace officer here.

456
00:41:06,253 --> 00:41:09,189
- Mr Clarke, the state prosecutor.
- How do you do? Well?

457
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:12,149
Well, we're gonna try to hang
our lawless friend.

458
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:16,078
- Before or after the trial?
- The penalty for murder is death, isn't it?

459
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:18,467
- That wasn't the idea.
- The idea?

460
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:21,058
That wasn't the idea you gave me
or James or the girl.

461
00:41:21,149 --> 00:41:22,840
Get this straight, Wright.

462
00:41:22,922 --> 00:41:27,160
When you're dealing with a criminal,
anything goes. Anything to trap him.

463
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:29,415
James is a thief and a murderer.

464
00:41:29,499 --> 00:41:32,282
The most notorious bandit
and outlaw in America.

465
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:37,254
He has burned my property, robbed my trains
and scared people out of riding in my cars.

466
00:41:37,338 --> 00:41:40,398
Three years ago, I swore
he'd hang for what he'd done

467
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,025
and, by the Almighty, he is going to hang.

468
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:48,476
- That ain't the way things are done here.
- You're a peace officer, aren't you?

469
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:50,889
But not a skunk.
You told Judge Mathews?

470
00:41:51,023 --> 00:41:55,296
It won't be necessary, my boy. He's been
superseded by Judge Rankin of St Louis

471
00:41:55,378 --> 00:41:59,208
who's not so sentimental about train robbers.

472
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:02,001
He arrives tonight.
The trial's tomorrow morning.

473
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:04,566
Anything else?

474
00:42:04,657 --> 00:42:06,479
A nice frame, eh?

475
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:11,886
And, Marshal, it might be better for you if you
dropped this role of attorney for the defence

476
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:15,912
- and confined yourself to your duties.
- Who? Me?

477
00:42:16,006 --> 00:42:19,272
- Any interference...
- It ain't me you got to worry about.

478
00:42:19,355 --> 00:42:21,198
What do you mean?

479
00:42:21,297 --> 00:42:24,357
Suppose Jesse don't want to be hanged.

480
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:34,206
Roy! Stop the press!

481
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:37,916
- Take a new editorial on railroad presidents.
- Yes, sir.

482
00:42:38,006 --> 00:42:39,819
Paragraph.

483
00:42:39,909 --> 00:42:43,891
If we are ever to have
law and order in the West,

484
00:42:44,702 --> 00:42:49,664
the first thing we gotta do is take out
all the railroad presidents

485
00:42:49,787 --> 00:42:52,212
and shoot 'em down like dogs. Paragraph.

486
00:42:52,298 --> 00:42:53,746
Where's Zee?

487
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:56,291
- Where you been?
- Up to Pine Ridge. Where's Zee?

488
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,384
- Zee? She's out.
- Out where?

489
00:42:58,468 --> 00:43:01,078
Well, she set out at...

490
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:05,614
I wouldn't want this to go
any further, you understand.

491
00:43:05,696 --> 00:43:06,941
I understand.

492
00:43:07,027 --> 00:43:09,980
- Well, she set out for the hills.
- Alone?

493
00:43:10,062 --> 00:43:12,024
Not exactly alone.

494
00:43:12,113 --> 00:43:18,047
She were being guided by a darkie
named Pinkie on a mule named Stinkie.

495
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,109
I see.

496
00:43:31,495 --> 00:43:33,218
Halt. Who goes there?

497
00:43:33,306 --> 00:43:36,771
- It's me - Pinkie.
- All right, Pinkie. What do you want?

498
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:40,199
- I got a letter here for Mr McCoy.
- Gimme.

499
00:43:41,169 --> 00:43:42,543
A letter for Mr McCoy.

500
00:43:42,626 --> 00:43:45,652
- Is you sure he'll get it, sir?
- He'll get it.

501
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,914
- For Mr McCoy.
- Mr McCoy?

502
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,018
For Mr McCoy.

503
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:55,305
We want the trial to get started
as early as possible.

504
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:02,040
Judge, read that.

505
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:10,809
Listen.

506
00:44:10,888 --> 00:44:12,294
"Mr McCoy."

507
00:44:12,388 --> 00:44:16,487
"If Jesse ain't out ofjail by midnight,
I'm a-comin' in and get him."

508
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:18,629
"Frank James."

509
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:25,906
- Well, that gives us an hour and a half.
- The nerve of him.

510
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:29,729
- What ails you?
- It's this note.

511
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:32,797
- What about it?
- I don't know if you gents know it or not,

512
00:44:32,894 --> 00:44:36,147
but, well, both these James boys does things.

513
00:44:36,236 --> 00:44:40,321
- What are you driving at?
- I've known Frank James a long time

514
00:44:40,402 --> 00:44:43,989
and when he says he aims to do something
he's liable to do it.

515
00:44:44,076 --> 00:44:46,553
Now, what on earth do you think he can do?

516
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:49,322
He says he's gonna take Jesse outta here.

517
00:44:49,402 --> 00:44:54,442
- I wish he'd try it. We'd grab him too.
- Of course we would. You're crazy.

518
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:57,225
He's a mighty set man, Frank is.

519
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,128
Have you heard about this ridiculous note?

520
00:45:13,218 --> 00:45:14,863
The word's got around.

521
00:45:14,951 --> 00:45:17,937
- You mean everybody knows about it?
- Everybody I met.

522
00:45:18,024 --> 00:45:21,325
They all regard it
as a very interesting situation.

523
00:45:21,408 --> 00:45:24,758
Interesting? Why, it's preposterous.

524
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:27,817
What do they think
a few ragged-pants bandits can do?

525
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,754
Don't they know this is a brickjail
surrounded and guarded by US soldiers?

526
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,454
Don't they know we could hold this jail
against an army of outlaws?

527
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:39,930
They do. That's what makes it so interesting.

528
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:44,060
But they know too that both the James boys
are mighty set in their ways.

529
00:45:44,143 --> 00:45:46,067
- Mighty set.
- That's what I said.

530
00:45:46,156 --> 00:45:49,938
Didn't I tell you to shut up?
How many deputies have you got?

531
00:45:50,029 --> 00:45:53,415
Six on call, but I could swear in
as many more as you want.

532
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:57,127
That's it. That's what we'll do.
We won't wait for the rascal.

533
00:45:57,217 --> 00:45:59,630
- We'll go out and get him.
- We could try.

534
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:02,496
You think he'll really come?

535
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:06,208
- Don't you?
- Sure. He wouldn't fool around about this.

536
00:46:06,298 --> 00:46:09,648
- He's probably on his way now.
- Well, let's not waste time.

537
00:46:09,731 --> 00:46:14,727
Swear in some good men. Surround the town.
Tell them to take him dead or alive.

538
00:46:14,817 --> 00:46:17,594
Tell them to shoot first
and ask questions later.

539
00:46:17,681 --> 00:46:21,463
- Tell them...
- Am I telling you how to run your railroad?

540
00:46:21,564 --> 00:46:25,099
- What do you mean?
- Don't try to tell me how to take a man.

541
00:46:25,191 --> 00:46:29,265
Just a minute, Marshal.
Where are you going?

542
00:46:29,338 --> 00:46:32,335
- To swear in some good men.
- Wait. I'll go with you.

543
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:35,363
I'm not a bad hand at picking men myself.

544
00:46:35,451 --> 00:46:37,912
Whatever you say, cap,
is exactly what I'll do.

545
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:40,155
Turn out all your men. Cover the town.

546
00:46:40,245 --> 00:46:45,161
It's an utterly ridiculous situation, but,
by cracky, I'm not going to take any chances.

547
00:46:45,251 --> 00:46:47,184
Mighty, mighty set.

548
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:53,560
Five dollars - one to three, he will.

549
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,539
$10, he won't.

550
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,728
$12 - even money, either way.

551
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,008
I've got $10 - one to five -

552
00:47:02,091 --> 00:47:05,839
that Frank James
will bite Mr McCoy in the leg.

553
00:47:08,252 --> 00:47:11,043
Bartender! Give me that mallet!

554
00:47:14,885 --> 00:47:16,743
Gentlemen!

555
00:47:16,827 --> 00:47:22,511
I want some deputies who've got to be able
to shoot straight the first time, or else.

556
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:25,552
- For Frank?
- For whoever I say.

557
00:47:25,645 --> 00:47:27,710
But if anybody has a mercenary streak,

558
00:47:27,799 --> 00:47:31,547
Mr McCoy is talking about doubling the pot
for whoever rings the bell.

559
00:47:31,634 --> 00:47:33,240
$10,000?

560
00:47:33,325 --> 00:47:36,510
All right, boys. Line up at the bar
so we can look at you.

561
00:47:37,075 --> 00:47:39,946
You and you. Ed, you're all right.
Bill, get over there.

562
00:47:40,033 --> 00:47:42,330
You. You.

563
00:47:42,415 --> 00:47:45,556
And you. You.
Charlie, you're good with a gun.

564
00:47:45,683 --> 00:47:48,246
I don't like him.
What's wrong with the big fella?

565
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,314
- Nothing.
- Then him.

566
00:47:50,403 --> 00:47:53,356
- All right. And you...
- And these two.

567
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:56,612
All right. You're the doctor.

568
00:47:56,704 --> 00:48:00,291
All right, men. Face me,
raise your right hands and take the oath.

569
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:04,893
Up a little higher.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13...

570
00:48:49,671 --> 00:48:52,412
Wild-goose chase.

571
00:48:52,493 --> 00:48:55,754
He won't be able to get into town,
much less this building.

572
00:48:55,834 --> 00:49:00,760
- The whole thing's a bluff.
- Well, it's 12 o'clock. Nothing's happened.

573
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,986
You...

574
00:49:04,076 --> 00:49:07,129
I couldn't help it.
I'm just nervous, that's all.

575
00:49:07,218 --> 00:49:10,006
Frank said he'd give you till 12
to let Jesse out

576
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:12,664
and if he wasn't out by then...

577
00:49:14,248 --> 00:49:16,705
- That's Jesse.
- Well, stop him.

578
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:21,865
I'll stop him, but it won't do no good.
It's dead certain Frank's comin' now.

579
00:49:21,956 --> 00:49:26,121
And Jesse feels him.
That's the way them boys is.

580
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:35,432
No matter what happens tonight,
fire or flood,

581
00:49:35,521 --> 00:49:40,164
I'm going to have that man fired tomorrow.

582
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:52,277
Major! Zee! They got him.

583
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:55,017
- Frank?
- Yeah. They jumped him in the woods.

584
00:49:55,104 --> 00:49:58,005
- Who? Who got him?
- Two of them deputies.

585
00:49:58,087 --> 00:50:02,309
Oh, them goldanged,
dad-blasted, golburned deputies!

586
00:50:02,382 --> 00:50:04,455
- Roy!
- Yes, sir.

587
00:50:10,921 --> 00:50:15,723
I just want to thank the young man for
simplifying one of our worst problems.

588
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:17,900
Take him in there.

589
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:27,185
- I sure am sorry, Frank. Any guns on you?
- I got it.

590
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:31,142
I sure wasn't lookin' for this.
Come on, son.

591
00:50:32,122 --> 00:50:34,208
Frank.

592
00:50:40,114 --> 00:50:42,481
- Sorry.
- It's all right, Marshal.

593
00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:49,508
You understand, this ain't any of my doing.
I just want you and Jesse to know that...

594
00:50:49,594 --> 00:50:53,628
all the honour and credit for this victory
of law and order goes to Mr McCoy.

595
00:50:53,712 --> 00:50:55,284
We understand.

596
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:58,915
- Is that all, Marshal?
- That's all, thank you.

597
00:51:00,097 --> 00:51:04,038
Then get outta here. Get out and stay out.

598
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:07,498
For a peace officer,
your attitude has been incredible.

599
00:51:07,581 --> 00:51:11,912
And make no doubt,
it'll be reported to the governor tomorrow.

600
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,218
So you won't want me any more tonight?

601
00:51:14,302 --> 00:51:17,043
Neither tonight, or any other day or night.

602
00:51:17,124 --> 00:51:19,105
- Is that official?
- It is.

603
00:51:19,188 --> 00:51:22,123
Sorry, Will. We didn't aim
to get you over a barrel.

604
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:23,786
Forget it, son.

605
00:51:23,913 --> 00:51:28,026
I figure that barrel's gonna be
mighty crowded before this night's over.

606
00:51:28,107 --> 00:51:30,189
Good night, everybody.

607
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:34,475
Good night, Marshal.

608
00:51:36,748 --> 00:51:39,728
Pretty smart, aren't you?

609
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:42,548
- You ought not to have done this, Mr McCoy.
- No?

610
00:51:42,635 --> 00:51:46,916
You ought not to have tried to trick Jesse
and me. You oughta have kept your word.

611
00:51:46,998 --> 00:51:50,668
- The way you're gonna keep yours?
- Sir?

612
00:51:50,753 --> 00:51:54,820
Well, you said you were
gonna take Jesse out of here.

613
00:51:54,907 --> 00:51:57,365
But I am.

614
00:52:00,443 --> 00:52:03,425
- Hey, Jesse?
- That you, Frank?

615
00:52:03,507 --> 00:52:06,526
It's me. You all right?

616
00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:10,226
- You're a cool one.
- Gettin' along just fine, Frank.

617
00:52:10,316 --> 00:52:13,634
He'll be glad to see you too.

618
00:52:16,712 --> 00:52:18,481
Lock the door, Tom.

619
00:52:18,563 --> 00:52:21,022
- Soldiers!
- Take it easy, boys.

620
00:52:23,729 --> 00:52:27,399
Now untie me.
No noise, understand?

621
00:52:30,517 --> 00:52:35,181
We don't aim to kill a soul if we can help it,
but the first man that hollers...

622
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:38,538
All you gotta do is to keep your hands up
and your mouth shut.

623
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:41,493
Everything's gonna be all right.

624
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:44,111
You'll never get away with this in the world.

625
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,766
I knowed it and I told you.

626
00:52:50,164 --> 00:52:51,948
Lay down.

627
00:52:55,785 --> 00:52:57,878
Lay down or be shot down.

628
00:53:04,504 --> 00:53:08,538
- What happened?
- Mr McCoy deputised Tom and Hank.

629
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:13,103
- On purpose?
- I guess he didn't have any better sense.

630
00:53:16,524 --> 00:53:21,323
What is this? A game?
Grown men playing on the floor like children.

631
00:53:21,422 --> 00:53:25,498
- Ain't it the truth?
- They wouldn't have it any other way.

632
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:31,214
Remember that?

633
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:39,002
Remember it?

634
00:53:39,139 --> 00:53:42,798
Don't kill me.

635
00:53:43,379 --> 00:53:46,075
I ain't. Not with a gun.

636
00:53:47,332 --> 00:53:51,082
But, brother, I'm gonna worry you to death.

637
00:53:52,418 --> 00:53:53,982
Now chew.

638
00:53:54,922 --> 00:53:58,192
See how it tastes. And swallow.

639
00:53:58,275 --> 00:54:00,732
Chew.

640
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:07,708
- You look like a man that's got good sense.
- Just name it, friend, and I'll do it.

641
00:54:07,796 --> 00:54:13,446
- You'll do it if you don't want to get shot.
- All you gotta do is name it.

642
00:54:14,344 --> 00:54:16,545
Give him a glass of water to wash it down.

643
00:54:16,635 --> 00:54:20,993
Everybody set? Just throw that door open
when I say the word and then step back.

644
00:54:21,081 --> 00:54:23,981
- You don't have to tell me to step back.
- Don't hurt nobody.

645
00:54:24,063 --> 00:54:27,130
We'll throw a few rounds down the street
for the fun of it.

646
00:54:27,218 --> 00:54:29,260
Ready? Open it.

647
00:54:42,514 --> 00:54:45,808
Stop them! Stop them! Hurry!

648
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,653
Get after them!

649
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:53,817
Get after them! Everybody!

650
00:54:59,223 --> 00:55:04,307
- Goodbye, Uncle Rufe.
- Goodbye, honey. I don't blame you.

651
00:55:07,782 --> 00:55:12,013
Jesse played fair.
He did everything he promised.

652
00:55:12,094 --> 00:55:16,495
So you gotta keep your part of the bargain
and stick to him, honey,

653
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:19,773
cos you're the only hope there is for him.

654
00:55:19,856 --> 00:55:22,428
- I'll stick, all right.
- Miss Zee.

655
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,534
Is we got everything?

656
00:55:27,204 --> 00:55:29,742
- I think so, Pinkie.
- Yes, ma'am.

657
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:33,217
- Goodbye, Uncle Rufe.
- Goodbye, honey.

658
00:55:33,341 --> 00:55:35,385
Let's go.

659
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,210
Come on. Play pony express.

660
00:57:17,648 --> 00:57:21,682
Well, I guess they'll be busy there for a while.

661
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:54,055
- Darling...
- Oh, Zee.

662
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:55,948
Oh, darling.

663
00:57:56,035 --> 00:57:58,123
Darling.

664
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:07,042
Just let me look at you.

665
00:58:14,601 --> 00:58:18,925
- You like the curtains?
- They're just as pretty as they can be.

666
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,059
I made them.

667
00:58:23,322 --> 00:58:25,540
My goodness, Zee. I...

668
00:58:25,624 --> 00:58:28,877
I never expected ever to have
a house as nice as this one.

669
00:58:28,979 --> 00:58:30,782
I made that too.

670
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:35,148
"God bless our home." That's better
than you can get in a store, Zee.

671
00:58:35,234 --> 00:58:38,489
- That's a mighty pretty frame too.
- Pinkie made that.

672
00:58:38,578 --> 00:58:41,565
- Good work, Pinkie.
- Thank you, Mr Jesse.

673
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:46,085
It sure is fine, Zee. The whole place.

674
00:58:46,175 --> 00:58:49,119
I'm just as proud of you as I can be.

675
00:58:49,201 --> 00:58:51,291
Giddap.

676
00:59:00,142 --> 00:59:02,185
Hello!

677
00:59:06,959 --> 00:59:09,054
Hello!

678
00:59:11,565 --> 00:59:14,103
- Evening, ma'am.
- Good evening.

679
00:59:14,187 --> 00:59:16,646
Do you know where the Wilsons live?

680
00:59:16,731 --> 00:59:21,311
- About a mile on up the road.
- Thank you, ma'am. Giddap.

681
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:25,924
- Pack.
- Yes, sir.

682
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:28,264
- Jesse...
- Pack. We're leaving.

683
00:59:28,354 --> 00:59:31,979
- But it was only a farmer.
- How do you know?

684
01:00:34,277 --> 01:00:39,637
- How is she, Doc?
- She's weak, of course, which is only...

685
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:43,757
- You're a friend of Mr Howard's, aren't you?
- You might say so.

686
01:00:43,843 --> 01:00:47,108
- Have you any idea where he is?
- He travels a lot.

687
01:00:47,191 --> 01:00:50,534
- Salesman?
- Something like that.

688
01:00:50,626 --> 01:00:56,304
You can tell him from me, any husband who
stays away from a wife at a time like this...

689
01:00:56,405 --> 01:00:58,564
I can't say I've got any use for him.

690
01:00:58,654 --> 01:01:02,518
- There's a lot in what you say.
- You can go up, but don't stay long.

691
01:01:05,802 --> 01:01:11,082
Ain't he the dad-blamedest,
cutest little cuss that ever...

692
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:22,662
Now, honey, you mustn't blame Jesse
for not getting here.

693
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:26,791
Maybe he just couldn't get away and, uh...

694
01:01:26,877 --> 01:01:32,989
- It doesn't matter.
- Honey, you shouldn't feel that way about it.

695
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:38,452
I can't help it. I'm too tired to care.

696
01:01:42,413 --> 01:01:44,985
This is the way it always is.

697
01:01:46,775 --> 01:01:50,766
We live like animals. Scared animals.

698
01:01:52,545 --> 01:01:56,486
We move. We hide.

699
01:01:56,578 --> 01:01:59,964
We don't dare go out.

700
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:06,579
All day and all night we just sit,
scared of a shadow on a window.

701
01:02:08,284 --> 01:02:11,949
Scared of a footstep on a porch.

702
01:02:12,047 --> 01:02:14,617
Scared of a door opening.

703
01:02:16,121 --> 01:02:19,665
And when he's away, it's worse.

704
01:02:19,755 --> 01:02:22,497
All I can think of is, "Is he dead?"

705
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:26,122
"Is he lying dead in the mud in the woods?"

706
01:02:28,915 --> 01:02:31,009
Maybe he's dead now.

707
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,457
Uncle Rufe, I wanna go home.

708
01:02:38,966 --> 01:02:42,796
You're home, Zee.
This is your home - yours and Jesse's.

709
01:02:43,452 --> 01:02:47,520
I mean home with you. Back to Liberty.

710
01:02:48,858 --> 01:02:51,970
- Will you take me?
- But, honey...

711
01:02:52,053 --> 01:02:54,174
Doggone it, I...

712
01:02:54,276 --> 01:02:57,215
But Jesse promised...

713
01:02:57,297 --> 01:03:00,199
Yes, I know.

714
01:03:00,281 --> 01:03:03,824
And I used to believe him.

715
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:07,106
But he'd never change.

716
01:03:07,189 --> 01:03:11,221
Jesse'll be an outlaw as long as he lives.

717
01:03:11,302 --> 01:03:13,795
I know it now.

718
01:03:15,097 --> 01:03:20,218
He's wild, Will.
He's like a horse you can't break.

719
01:03:20,303 --> 01:03:27,801
He's crazy with wildness and there's nothing
you or me or him or anybody can do about it.

720
01:03:29,342 --> 01:03:32,773
That's why all last night I wanted to die.

721
01:03:32,857 --> 01:03:35,642
I prayed and prayed that I'd die.

722
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:40,678
And my baby...
I prayed that he'd die too and end it all.

723
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:50,446
My darling.

724
01:03:50,537 --> 01:03:54,046
Mommy didn't mean that, honey.

725
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:59,619
My precious baby.
Mommy didn't mean that, honey.

726
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:06,597
That's all right, honey.

727
01:04:08,948 --> 01:04:11,018
I'll take you home.

728
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:29,528
Hi, Pinkie. Zee!

729
01:04:29,612 --> 01:04:32,101
- Mr Jesse.
- Yes?

730
01:04:34,296 --> 01:04:36,026
She's gone.

731
01:04:36,108 --> 01:04:38,734
- Gone? Gone where?
- Her and the baby...

732
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,669
- The baby?
- Yes, sir.

733
01:04:40,755 --> 01:04:45,475
- Was she... Were they all right?
- Yes, sir. They's all right, both of 'em.

734
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:50,279
But she gone now. The major come
and took 'em away back to Liberty.

735
01:04:50,363 --> 01:04:54,730
This here's a letter she give me
to give to you, sir.

736
01:05:17,935 --> 01:05:20,028
Poor kid.

737
01:05:21,328 --> 01:05:26,231
I tried to get here, Pinkie, but I just couldn't.
They got after me and...

738
01:05:26,334 --> 01:05:27,704
Did you see him?

739
01:05:27,785 --> 01:05:31,296
Mr Jesse, he's the cutest little old thing
I ever did see.

740
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:35,412
Just a-yellin' and a-hollerin'
so it nearly bust your ears.

741
01:05:35,493 --> 01:05:39,197
I bet he's the loudest-yellin' baby
that ever was born.

742
01:05:39,288 --> 01:05:41,745
- What colour eyes has he got, Pinkie?
- Blue.

743
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:46,348
Great big old blue eyes, big as a saucer,
lookin' right at you, sir.

744
01:05:46,436 --> 01:05:48,811
- Does he look like Zee?
- Like you.

745
01:05:48,896 --> 01:05:52,728
- No...
- He's the spittin' image of you, Mr Jesse.

746
01:05:52,813 --> 01:05:55,875
- Well, I'll be doggone.
- 'Cepting he's bald.

747
01:05:55,957 --> 01:05:58,050
He's bald as a peeled egg.

748
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:02,253
But, my goodness, Mr Jesse,
that sure is one cute little old baby.

749
01:06:02,334 --> 01:06:04,631
I'll be doggone.

750
01:06:04,716 --> 01:06:08,068
Just yell and wave his little old arms.

751
01:06:09,322 --> 01:06:14,283
- Doggone.
- Yes, sir. We's all mighty proud of that baby.

752
01:06:14,368 --> 01:06:18,788
Lord, Lord. I guess we'd better go after them,
Pinkie. When did they leave?

753
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:21,510
- They left Monday.
- On the train?

754
01:06:21,596 --> 01:06:23,810
No, sir. In the major's buggy.

755
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:28,606
Oh. I don't like that. We'll have
some supper, then we'll go after them.

756
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:31,150
- But, Mr Jesse...
- Yes?

757
01:06:31,273 --> 01:06:34,382
I don't know if I'd go after 'em right now.

758
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:35,795
No? Why not?

759
01:06:35,881 --> 01:06:39,711
They got that Mr Wright with them.

760
01:06:39,799 --> 01:06:43,225
- Wright?
- Yes, sir. The police marshal.

761
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:45,608
He come too.

762
01:06:49,566 --> 01:06:52,229
I see.

763
01:06:52,313 --> 01:06:54,880
Never mind the supper, Pinkie.
We'll start now.

764
01:06:54,972 --> 01:06:57,385
You mean after 'em?

765
01:06:57,476 --> 01:06:59,489
Yes, right now.

766
01:07:25,977 --> 01:07:28,434
What did she say about being unhappy?

767
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:31,507
It's just like I told you, Mr Jesse.

768
01:07:31,594 --> 01:07:35,503
She say she scared all the time
and I know she cried a lot.

769
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:38,763
She say she don't know
how she could stand it.

770
01:07:38,896 --> 01:07:40,944
I see.

771
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:52,085
- I guess I can't blame her.
- That's just what she says.

772
01:07:52,176 --> 01:07:54,475
I guess it was pretty bad for her.

773
01:07:55,811 --> 01:07:58,427
Yes, sir, I guess it was.

774
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:07,352
Pinkie, I'm not going any further.

775
01:08:07,434 --> 01:08:10,624
You mean you ain't goin' after 'em?

776
01:08:10,707 --> 01:08:14,169
I've changed my mind. She's right.

777
01:08:14,262 --> 01:08:17,356
There ain't any happiness
to be found with me.

778
01:08:17,444 --> 01:08:21,147
If she can find it at all, it's without me.

779
01:08:21,237 --> 01:08:24,384
- Yes, sir.
- Tell her that.

780
01:08:24,472 --> 01:08:26,680
Tell her I won't bother her any more.

781
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,551
If she can be happy now, I'm glad.

782
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:33,631
Tell her that too.

783
01:08:33,713 --> 01:08:35,806
Yes, sir.

784
01:08:37,065 --> 01:08:39,116
And, Pinkie, tell her...

785
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:42,223
Yes, sir?

786
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:48,933
Tell her not to let the baby know
anything about me. I won't mind.

787
01:09:32,123 --> 01:09:34,666
- Roy!
- Yes, sir.

788
01:09:34,751 --> 01:09:38,279
- Take an editorial on dentists!
- Yes, sir.

789
01:09:39,756 --> 01:09:41,810
Paragraph.

790
01:09:42,865 --> 01:09:47,342
If we are ever to have
law and order in the West,

791
01:09:47,424 --> 01:09:50,122
the first thing we got to do

792
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:54,771
- is take out all the dentists...
- Ding-a-ling! Choo-choo!

793
01:09:54,854 --> 01:09:59,227
Ding-a-ling! Choo-choo!
Get out of the way. Choo-choo!

794
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:01,642
Help! Help! Save me.

795
01:10:01,748 --> 01:10:03,724
Save my life.

796
01:10:03,813 --> 01:10:08,101
And shoot 'em down like dogs.

797
01:10:12,534 --> 01:10:14,627
Save me!

798
01:10:17,002 --> 01:10:19,107
Stop it, both of you. Stop it!

799
01:10:19,194 --> 01:10:21,882
- I...
- Stop it.

800
01:10:22,904 --> 01:10:27,005
- He's worse than the child.
- But they're great fun.

801
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:30,500
- How old is he?
- Just five.

802
01:10:30,582 --> 01:10:33,480
You don't say. Mine's going on three.

803
01:10:33,567 --> 01:10:36,024
Wait a minute.

804
01:10:36,109 --> 01:10:38,680
- Here. Can he have a piece?
- Yes.

805
01:10:43,377 --> 01:10:44,655
Say, "Thank you, sir."

806
01:10:44,746 --> 01:10:47,357
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

807
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,274
- Wonderful child.
- Thank you.

808
01:10:50,355 --> 01:10:53,706
- Are you the editor, sir?
- I am, sir.

809
01:10:53,789 --> 01:10:58,546
- What can I do for you, my friend?
- I want to run this card in your next issue.

810
01:10:58,635 --> 01:11:01,537
"George Remington,
Remington Blueing Company, Philadelphia."

811
01:11:01,627 --> 01:11:04,292
"Now at Dixie Belle Hotel." How much, sir?

812
01:11:04,374 --> 01:11:08,189
I guess about a dollar'll cover it,
Mr Remington.

813
01:11:08,327 --> 01:11:09,602
There you are.

814
01:11:09,694 --> 01:11:12,598
- Thank you, sir.
- And thank you very much. Goodbye.

815
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,917
Goodbye. Roy! Set this...

816
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:16,554
By the way...

817
01:11:16,635 --> 01:11:20,900
Didn't that fella Jesse James
come from somewheres around here?

818
01:11:20,995 --> 01:11:24,061
He did. Why?

819
01:11:24,143 --> 01:11:28,224
I suppose you're protesting against
this amnesty offer by the governor.

820
01:11:28,311 --> 01:11:32,896
- What amnesty offer?
- Haven't you heard?

821
01:11:32,982 --> 01:11:35,361
Well, sir, it's an outrage.

822
01:11:35,446 --> 01:11:39,069
In Jefferson City a friend of mine -
a banker - told me about it.

823
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:43,836
The governor has promised amnesty, a clean
pardon, to any member of the James gang

824
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:47,383
that will kill Jesse.
And that's in addition to the reward.

825
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,739
- Are you sure of that?
- Positive, sir.

826
01:11:49,824 --> 01:11:52,433
But that makes the state a party to murder.

827
01:11:52,525 --> 01:11:57,360
- Exactly what I said.
- Why, the dirty rotten, filthy...

828
01:11:57,450 --> 01:12:01,564
- Thank you, sir. Thank you for the news.
- Not at all, sir. Not at all.

829
01:12:01,645 --> 01:12:04,261
I'll just get it into this week's edition.

830
01:12:04,347 --> 01:12:07,560
- Zee...
- And an editorial!

831
01:12:07,662 --> 01:12:10,278
Please. He might have got it all wrong.

832
01:12:10,364 --> 01:12:15,200
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter to me.
That's all over now.

833
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:18,994
- Roy, you started that editorial on dentists?
- Yes, sir.

834
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:23,762
Change it from dentists to governors and
finish it like last week's one on horse thieves,

835
01:12:23,851 --> 01:12:26,751
except this time it's governors.

836
01:12:41,986 --> 01:12:44,063
Morning.

837
01:12:45,856 --> 01:12:50,362
- Nice day, isn't it?
- I don't wanna buy nothin'.

838
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:55,008
I'm not selling anything.
You're Mrs Bob Ford, aren't you?

839
01:12:57,503 --> 01:13:01,046
I'm Mrs Ford, but iffen it's about my husband
I don't know anything.

840
01:13:01,136 --> 01:13:03,511
I ain't seed him in months.

841
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:08,821
He rid off with them James boys
and I ain't seed hair nor hide of him since.

842
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:12,409
It's not him I was looking for, Mrs Ford.
It's you.

843
01:13:12,493 --> 01:13:17,286
I got this here Liberty paper yesterday and
it's got some news that might interest you.

844
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:20,561
And here's my card.

845
01:13:20,644 --> 01:13:22,731
That's all.

846
01:13:39,133 --> 01:13:41,077
- Here.
- What is it?

847
01:13:41,158 --> 01:13:43,446
You know I can't read.

848
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:55,022
What's it say?

849
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,948
Well?

850
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:24,829
The bank of Northfield, Minnesota,
is the strongest bank in the Northwest.

851
01:14:24,912 --> 01:14:29,343
It's wide open for us.
They've got $50,000 in gold in the safe.

852
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:33,020
All we gotta do is walk in with a shovel
and help ourselves.

853
01:14:33,104 --> 01:14:35,676
So that's what we're gonna do.

854
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:39,311
Well?

855
01:14:41,306 --> 01:14:44,399
Well, as a matter of fact, Jesse...

856
01:14:44,487 --> 01:14:46,864
- Well?
- Well...

857
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:49,069
What is this anyhow?

858
01:14:49,154 --> 01:14:53,444
For more than a month there's been
something funny going on here. What is it?

859
01:14:53,546 --> 01:14:56,198
Well, to tell you the truth, Jesse,

860
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:59,780
we don't exactly know
if we like this idea or not.

861
01:14:59,864 --> 01:15:02,976
For one thing,
that's a mighty strong bank at Northfield

862
01:15:03,058 --> 01:15:05,959
and it's a long ways away.

863
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:08,858
- And for another...
- Go on.

864
01:15:08,945 --> 01:15:15,149
Well, I've been talkin' it over
with some of the boys and...

865
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:18,428
Well, you're taking chances, Jesse,
that we don't like.

866
01:15:18,516 --> 01:15:20,767
I ain't no coward and you know it.

867
01:15:20,857 --> 01:15:25,375
But some of the things you got us into,
it scared the livin' daylights out of me.

868
01:15:25,462 --> 01:15:28,957
- You're takin' too many chances.
- Shut up! Go on.

869
01:15:29,097 --> 01:15:32,030
- We all know you got your troubles...
- Forget that.

870
01:15:32,121 --> 01:15:35,949
Maybe you don't care
if you get shot full of buckshot or not.

871
01:15:36,034 --> 01:15:38,850
But the way we feel about it...

872
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:42,043
We got a lot of respect for you, Jesse,
and you know it.

873
01:15:42,131 --> 01:15:46,655
But the way you're goin' on is just like
you was tryin' to commit suicide.

874
01:15:50,490 --> 01:15:53,553
- Just who do you think you are?
- Listen, Jesse...

875
01:15:53,634 --> 01:15:55,966
Go on. Reach.

876
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:03,444
So you talked things over, did you?

877
01:16:03,524 --> 01:16:06,494
And who are you? The captain of this band?

878
01:16:06,585 --> 01:16:09,340
Who's handling these jobs?
You, me or somebody else?

879
01:16:09,462 --> 01:16:13,050
Well, I'll tell you if you don't know.
It's me. I'm doin' it, see?

880
01:16:13,176 --> 01:16:16,363
And I'll ride up the Capitol steps
if I feel like it.

881
01:16:20,804 --> 01:16:23,866
So you talked it over, huh? Without me.

882
01:16:24,919 --> 01:16:27,081
Well, I don't like it.

883
01:16:27,181 --> 01:16:30,118
And it ain't the way I aim to have things.

884
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:34,723
If that's the way you want it, I give you
leave now - all of you - to talk it over again.

885
01:16:34,811 --> 01:16:37,427
Now... outside.

886
01:16:37,513 --> 01:16:39,685
Go on. Get out!

887
01:16:40,508 --> 01:16:44,455
- Now, listen here, Jesse.
- Yes, and you too.

888
01:16:44,541 --> 01:16:46,875
You talked it over with them.

889
01:16:46,965 --> 01:16:49,820
Think I need you? Any of you?

890
01:16:49,907 --> 01:16:53,247
You think I can't get a thousand men
to come in with Jesse James?

891
01:16:53,330 --> 01:16:56,242
Well, if you don't, you're crazy.
Now get out!

892
01:17:13,924 --> 01:17:16,904
He acts like he's goin' crazy.

893
01:17:16,992 --> 01:17:19,119
He gets worse every day.

894
01:17:19,248 --> 01:17:22,355
I'll kill him for that if it's my last act.

895
01:17:24,248 --> 01:17:28,413
Wait for me down at the creek.
I wanna talk to him.

896
01:17:42,343 --> 01:17:44,476
Well?

897
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:50,086
First, Jesse, I want you to understand
I ain't a-scared of you or your guns.

898
01:17:50,173 --> 01:17:52,999
So if you feel like shooting,
you just start drawing.

899
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:56,466
- I'll start drawing too.
- Is that what you came back to tell me?

900
01:17:56,564 --> 01:17:59,697
No, that's to clear your conscience
if you get ornery.

901
01:17:59,785 --> 01:18:01,644
I'll remember.

902
01:18:01,726 --> 01:18:04,624
What I come back to tell you was,
you're a skunk.

903
01:18:08,219 --> 01:18:09,783
Wanna draw?

904
01:18:11,964 --> 01:18:14,500
Go on.

905
01:18:14,586 --> 01:18:17,538
You're mean, Jesse.
You're gettin' meaner every day.

906
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:21,214
I don't know if you're goin' crazy,
but sometimes it looks like it.

907
01:18:21,298 --> 01:18:24,923
Ever since you come back from St Joe
it's been lookin' like it.

908
01:18:25,013 --> 01:18:26,986
There ain't enough money in the world

909
01:18:27,074 --> 01:18:30,529
to take the chances you've made us take
the last year or two.

910
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:34,657
And you wouldn't be slappin' an old friend
like Tom, and him a slow draw,

911
01:18:34,742 --> 01:18:37,111
if you was in your right mind.

912
01:18:37,194 --> 01:18:40,109
So you're either crazy or you're a skunk.

913
01:18:42,533 --> 01:18:44,910
Go on. Draw if you feel like it.

914
01:18:46,938 --> 01:18:49,021
You go on.

915
01:18:50,496 --> 01:18:55,368
You're my brother, Jesse, my kid brother,
and I reckon I love you.

916
01:18:55,452 --> 01:19:00,602
But it ain't proving anything to let you
get my head blowed off - or your own.

917
01:19:00,693 --> 01:19:05,256
I know how you feel about
what happened after the baby was born.

918
01:19:05,339 --> 01:19:08,230
And I know you don't like
to get talked to this way.

919
01:19:08,316 --> 01:19:13,092
But it's either this or see you
get blammed right outta your pants.

920
01:19:13,176 --> 01:19:17,010
Somebody had to tell you
before it was too late.

921
01:19:18,664 --> 01:19:21,234
So what do you figure
you wanna do about it?

922
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,683
I'm sorry, Frank.

923
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:32,372
Want me to fetch 'em back?

924
01:19:32,455 --> 01:19:35,211
- Can you?
- Sure I can.

925
01:19:35,291 --> 01:19:37,382
Frank...

926
01:19:38,283 --> 01:19:40,413
Much obliged.

927
01:19:40,497 --> 01:19:42,592
You're welcome, kid.

928
01:19:50,389 --> 01:19:51,509
Jesse.

929
01:19:52,851 --> 01:19:55,547
- Bob?
- It's me.

930
01:19:55,635 --> 01:19:57,728
Come in.

931
01:20:01,932 --> 01:20:05,729
- Where's everybody?
- They'll be back after a while.

932
01:20:20,702 --> 01:20:24,883
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

933
01:20:24,967 --> 01:20:27,225
Sit down.

934
01:20:27,318 --> 01:20:29,612
Nothing's the matter.

935
01:20:39,758 --> 01:20:43,263
- I've been to see my wife.
- I know.

936
01:20:50,284 --> 01:20:51,576
- Hi, Bob.
- Hi, fellas.

937
01:20:51,668 --> 01:20:53,072
Hi, Bob.

938
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:56,622
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, Jesse. I understand.

939
01:20:56,712 --> 01:21:02,323
- Northfield's all right with us.
- Good. We'll get going at daylight.

940
01:21:02,411 --> 01:21:05,590
Northfield's 450 miles from here.
We'll make it by Friday.

941
01:21:05,675 --> 01:21:09,705
We'll hole up outside of town
and jump the bank about noon on Saturday.

942
01:21:09,786 --> 01:21:14,098
If it's as rich as they say it is,
why, maybe we can all retire then.

943
01:21:14,177 --> 01:21:16,591
Sound all right to everyone?

944
01:21:16,696 --> 01:21:19,058
That's fine. Very fine.

945
01:21:35,547 --> 01:21:37,638
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

946
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:39,498
- Mr Layworth?
- Over there, sir.

947
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:41,262
Thank you.

948
01:21:44,346 --> 01:21:47,088
Come in.

949
01:21:47,169 --> 01:21:49,661
- Mr Layworth?
- Yes.

950
01:21:53,477 --> 01:21:55,559
My card.

951
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:59,075
I'm glad to meet you, Mr Runyan.

952
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:02,463
- What can I do for you?
- First, read this.

953
01:22:12,596 --> 01:22:14,854
- What does it mean?
- It's the James gang.

954
01:22:14,958 --> 01:22:17,694
- They're on their way here.
- Here?

955
01:22:17,775 --> 01:22:19,952
The James gang?

956
01:22:20,042 --> 01:22:23,497
- The James gang! To rob my bank?
- That's it.

957
01:22:23,585 --> 01:22:27,329
Great thunderin' hallelujah!
That's ruin. They'll take everything.

958
01:22:27,414 --> 01:22:31,196
- I've got $50,000.
- Easy, easy.

959
01:22:31,289 --> 01:22:33,507
There's no danger. Don't you see?

960
01:22:33,591 --> 01:22:35,888
- I'm here.
- But...

961
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:54,072
- Why, Cousin Bushrod.
- Well, if it ain't Cousin Beauregard.

962
01:23:54,157 --> 01:23:57,107
- Howdy, Cousin. How are you?
- Well, I'll be doggone.

963
01:23:57,194 --> 01:23:59,263
I ain't seen you in a coon's age.

964
01:23:59,346 --> 01:24:03,604
Come in the bank. I gotta change some
money. How's Aunt Mary Lou and the twins?

965
01:25:09,444 --> 01:25:11,498
Change this for me, Colonel?

966
01:25:11,587 --> 01:25:14,779
I'll get the money from the safe.
Will you wait, please?

967
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:34,106
- Holy smoke.
- Come on.

968
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:47,031
- Come on, Tom.
- It's no use.

969
01:25:47,122 --> 01:25:49,255
Come on, Jesse.

970
01:27:20,482 --> 01:27:23,098
We gotta keep goin', son. Hold on.

971
01:27:23,184 --> 01:27:26,615
Hold tight, Jesse,
cos there's only one way outta here.

972
01:27:26,699 --> 01:27:28,433
Are you holdin' on?

973
01:27:32,357 --> 01:27:33,721
Giddap!

974
01:27:49,103 --> 01:27:50,746
Jesse.

975
01:27:51,807 --> 01:27:53,900
Jesse.

976
01:28:09,686 --> 01:28:13,552
Hurry up, boys. Hurry up.
He's in here somewhere.

977
01:29:12,946 --> 01:29:17,782
"Of the eight bandits who attempted
the raid on the Northfield bank,

978
01:29:17,873 --> 01:29:20,536
two are dead and four are prisoners,

979
01:29:20,616 --> 01:29:24,524
but of the two leaders
there is less definite news."

980
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:30,054
"Reports yesterday indicated that
Frank James had made good his escape,

981
01:29:30,136 --> 01:29:33,642
but of Jesse James there is no news at all."

982
01:29:33,724 --> 01:29:37,473
"The belief is that he was drowned,

983
01:29:37,561 --> 01:29:43,550
but if he escaped he is thought to be
badly wounded and unable to travel far."

984
01:29:45,896 --> 01:29:50,031
The dad-blasted, goldinged city police.

985
01:29:50,170 --> 01:29:52,257
- Roy!
- Yes, sir?

986
01:29:52,341 --> 01:29:55,770
I'm gonna write me an editorial...

987
01:29:57,107 --> 01:29:59,518
If he escaped...

988
01:30:02,628 --> 01:30:05,738
- You got to stop it, Zee. You've got to.
- I know it.

989
01:30:05,826 --> 01:30:10,742
He ain't the Jesse you knew and loved.
That fella's gone a long time ago.

990
01:30:10,832 --> 01:30:13,735
I could have liked him too,
but not this bad fella.

991
01:30:13,819 --> 01:30:17,325
This one I could...
Well, if I ever come on him again...

992
01:30:17,409 --> 01:30:18,609
If he escaped...

993
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:22,244
Can't you understand, Zee, he's no good?
It's like I told you.

994
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:24,905
Once you let yourself go, you can't stop.

995
01:30:24,997 --> 01:30:28,944
He ain't a knight any more,
fighting a bad railroad. He's a wild animal.

996
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:31,085
You can't love him. Nobody can.

997
01:30:31,179 --> 01:30:35,931
Why, everybody that liked him,
he's done wrong to.

998
01:30:36,019 --> 01:30:39,291
And with his men gone,
he hasn't a friend left.

999
01:30:39,374 --> 01:30:41,750
Not a friend in the world.

1000
01:30:41,835 --> 01:30:44,213
That's right too, isn't it?

1001
01:30:46,718 --> 01:30:49,089
Not a friend in the world.

1002
01:31:09,809 --> 01:31:11,624
Hey, you.

1003
01:31:11,706 --> 01:31:14,234
You. We're here.

1004
01:31:22,002 --> 01:31:23,451
Thank you.

1005
01:31:28,868 --> 01:31:32,692
- Keep your mouth shut.
- Thank you very kindly.

1006
01:31:34,355 --> 01:31:37,257
- Do you think you can make it?
- Yeah.

1007
01:31:40,877 --> 01:31:45,165
- Do you need some help?
- No, I'm all right. You go ahead.

1008
01:31:45,283 --> 01:31:47,341
Giddap.

1009
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:06,425
My poor, poor darling.

1010
01:33:06,508 --> 01:33:08,999
My poor, hurt darling.

1011
01:33:15,027 --> 01:33:19,545
Zee. Is it really you?

1012
01:33:19,633 --> 01:33:22,403
I knew if you could you'd come here.

1013
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:26,363
That's why I came.

1014
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:28,749
I knew you'd come.

1015
01:33:29,791 --> 01:33:32,089
What's left of me.

1016
01:33:33,718 --> 01:33:36,540
But I'll get you well.

1017
01:33:38,206 --> 01:33:40,291
Wait.

1018
01:33:43,530 --> 01:33:47,275
Jesse. Hurry, Pinkie, hurry.

1019
01:34:08,158 --> 01:34:10,638
Well, I'll be doggone.

1020
01:34:19,128 --> 01:34:21,621
It's Daddy, dear.

1021
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:34,429
My son.

1022
01:34:38,341 --> 01:34:44,036
- Mommy.
- Daddy's been hurt, dear, but he'll be all right.

1023
01:34:44,118 --> 01:34:46,414
Well, I'll be doggone.

1024
01:34:50,215 --> 01:34:52,955
Doggone.

1025
01:34:54,168 --> 01:34:57,276
Don't you think he's big for five?

1026
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:07,118
Does he know anything about me yet?

1027
01:35:07,246 --> 01:35:09,937
No. Not yet.

1028
01:35:17,498 --> 01:35:19,562
Oh, Zee...

1029
01:35:20,708 --> 01:35:23,959
Is it too late?

1030
01:35:24,973 --> 01:35:28,722
Could we still go away?

1031
01:35:28,808 --> 01:35:31,265
To California?

1032
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:33,916
No, it isn't too late.

1033
01:35:34,004 --> 01:35:40,045
We'll go just as soon as you get well.
Pinkie's gone to get the doctor now.

1034
01:35:40,131 --> 01:35:43,503
Jesse, I do love you so.

1035
01:36:08,516 --> 01:36:11,751
Jesse. You mustn't do that.

1036
01:36:11,834 --> 01:36:16,397
- Go on, I'm all right.
- But Pinkie'll take care of all that, darling.

1037
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,018
Oh, Zee.

1038
01:36:19,104 --> 01:36:22,488
- Kinda happy, ain't you?
- Aren't you?

1039
01:36:22,577 --> 01:36:27,397
Jesse, if we were just
leaving today, this very hour.

1040
01:36:27,487 --> 01:36:31,520
- Nothing's gonna stop us, honey.
- I hope not.

1041
01:36:33,109 --> 01:36:38,343
But I'm scared, Jesse. I'll be scared
every second until we're on our way.

1042
01:36:39,406 --> 01:36:42,237
Maybe until we get to California.

1043
01:36:42,318 --> 01:36:45,136
Well, we won't have any money, remember.

1044
01:36:45,222 --> 01:36:49,530
- That money I hid in the hills...
- I don't want you to talk about that any more.

1045
01:36:49,618 --> 01:36:52,883
We'll make money.
Money we won't be ashamed of.

1046
01:36:52,966 --> 01:36:57,004
- Well, I wasn't ashamed...
- Now, stop it, I say.

1047
01:36:57,085 --> 01:36:59,463
Mr Howard.

1048
01:36:59,548 --> 01:37:03,297
- Yes?
- There's two gentlemen to see you, sir.

1049
01:37:05,885 --> 01:37:09,677
- What do they want?
- You knows them, sir.

1050
01:37:12,186 --> 01:37:13,715
All right.

1051
01:37:14,604 --> 01:37:16,897
He's human, ain't he?

1052
01:37:22,034 --> 01:37:26,500
- Well, sir. Hello, Bob. How are you?
- All right, I reckon. How are you, Jesse?

1053
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:29,792
I'm toting some lead inside me,
but it doesn't bother me any.

1054
01:37:29,875 --> 01:37:32,975
- This here's my brother, Charlie.
- Hello, Charlie.

1055
01:37:33,057 --> 01:37:35,108
- Pinkie. Some coffee.
- Yes, sir.

1056
01:37:35,197 --> 01:37:36,962
Sit down, Bob.

1057
01:37:39,474 --> 01:37:43,415
- You look like you've come a long way.
- It's hot.

1058
01:37:44,387 --> 01:37:47,414
I escaped. They couldn't hold me.

1059
01:37:47,501 --> 01:37:50,196
Me and two fellas you don't know
jumped over a wall.

1060
01:37:50,277 --> 01:37:53,116
How'd you know where I was?

1061
01:37:53,197 --> 01:37:58,238
We seen Frank. He sent us.
That's what we come to see you about.

1062
01:37:58,323 --> 01:38:00,702
How's Frank? Where is he?

1063
01:38:00,787 --> 01:38:04,698
He's fine. He's up in the hills.

1064
01:38:04,783 --> 01:38:09,262
He's aiming to come down pretty soon.
That's what he wanted us to see you about.

1065
01:38:09,986 --> 01:38:12,081
Jesse!

1066
01:38:14,872 --> 01:38:17,887
- Are you going to be long?
- You remember Bob Ford, honey.

1067
01:38:17,969 --> 01:38:21,895
- That's his brother, Charlie.
- Howdy, Miss Zee.

1068
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:27,318
- Are you going to be long?
- Stop your frettin'. I'll be up in just a minute.

1069
01:38:31,547 --> 01:38:35,860
Frank wanted us to tell you that if you feel
strong enough he wants you to meet him.

1070
01:38:35,945 --> 01:38:38,483
It's the Platte bank.

1071
01:38:38,569 --> 01:38:40,946
No. I'm going to California.

1072
01:38:41,031 --> 01:38:43,774
Frank's mighty anxious.

1073
01:38:43,892 --> 01:38:47,398
- Sorry. My mind's made up.
- There ain't even a marshal in the town.

1074
01:38:47,488 --> 01:38:50,952
There's a farm payroll on the 7th.
Frank's got three men already.

1075
01:38:51,042 --> 01:38:56,245
He don't figure it'll be any trouble at all.
Just walk in and take it.

1076
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:17,311
No.

1077
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:24,132
If you got plenty of money to start
in California, you don't need to think about it.

1078
01:39:24,270 --> 01:39:27,648
But if you was to need a bankroll, why...

1079
01:39:31,407 --> 01:39:35,308
I haven't got much money.
Hardly any money at all.

1080
01:39:47,967 --> 01:39:50,255
What else did Frank say?

1081
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:56,470
He says it's the easiestjob you ever seen.
He says it'll only take a day to look it over.

1082
01:39:56,556 --> 01:40:01,748
Then if you're set on going to the coast
you got some money.

1083
01:40:01,839 --> 01:40:07,576
- Sure could use some money.
- This is just like picking it up off the ground.

1084
01:40:08,830 --> 01:40:11,240
- When did he want to meet me?
- Right away.

1085
01:40:11,332 --> 01:40:15,449
Daddy, Daddy! I wanna come in.

1086
01:40:15,531 --> 01:40:18,798
- I wanna come in.
- He can't go in. He'll spoil our game.

1087
01:40:18,881 --> 01:40:22,020
Come on in, but stop that hollering.

1088
01:40:23,075 --> 01:40:27,438
Frank figures we oughta clear
about two thousand apiece.

1089
01:40:28,691 --> 01:40:31,642
Sure could use $2,000.

1090
01:40:31,725 --> 01:40:34,225
Daddy, Daddy!

1091
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:36,609
Those kids. Just a minute.

1092
01:40:38,383 --> 01:40:41,843
- Excuse me, Mr James.
- Howard.

1093
01:40:41,929 --> 01:40:45,516
Are you gonna walk around outside
with them guns?

1094
01:40:46,811 --> 01:40:48,906
You're right.

1095
01:41:04,181 --> 01:41:08,244
- We didn't hurt him, Mr Howard.
- We just killed him. That's the game.

1096
01:41:08,376 --> 01:41:10,464
He's little. You shouldn't play so rough.

1097
01:41:10,548 --> 01:41:13,979
- But that's the way you play outlaw.
- Jesse James has got to die.

1098
01:41:14,062 --> 01:41:18,638
I'll die, but they stuck me with sticks.
Just shoot me, don't stick me.

1099
01:41:18,748 --> 01:41:20,789
Bang, bang, bang!

1100
01:41:20,874 --> 01:41:24,705
- You're Jesse James. You're dead.
- I'm dead.

1101
01:41:31,991 --> 01:41:34,082
Go home, boys.

1102
01:42:05,530 --> 01:42:08,552
Get him ready.
We're catching the afternoon train.

1103
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:12,408
Pinkie can follow with
whatever we can't carry.

1104
01:42:12,503 --> 01:42:14,600
That suit you?

1105
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:19,423
Oh, thank goodness, Jesse.

1106
01:42:27,415 --> 01:42:30,959
I'm sorry, Bob. Tell Frank
I'll write to him from California.

1107
01:42:31,049 --> 01:42:34,029
- You mean you ain't coming with us?
- That's it.

1108
01:42:34,111 --> 01:42:35,871
What'll Frank say?

1109
01:42:35,959 --> 01:42:39,149
Can't make much difference what he says.
I ain't going to him.

1110
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:40,996
Goodbye, Charlie.

1111
01:42:41,093 --> 01:42:45,452
Goodbye, Bob. I'm sorry you came
all the way up here for nothing.

1112
01:42:45,534 --> 01:42:51,627
- What'll we tell Frank?
- Tell him to join me while the joining's good.

1113
01:42:51,715 --> 01:42:54,409
Oh, Mr Howard, we've got to run

1114
01:42:54,495 --> 01:42:59,295
- For we're going to California
- With a banjo on our knee

1115
01:43:00,511 --> 01:43:03,174
Oh, Zee.

1116
01:43:03,254 --> 01:43:05,829
- Honey, what can I do to help?
- Jesse, that.

1117
01:43:05,916 --> 01:43:08,050
You bet your life. Zee...

1118
01:43:10,202 --> 01:43:15,277
Cos we're going to California
on the train this afternoon

1119
01:43:41,936 --> 01:43:44,020
Jesse!

1120
01:43:48,144 --> 01:43:50,150
Pinkie!

1121
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:53,228
Oh, Jesse...

1122
01:43:54,916 --> 01:43:57,211
Oh, Jesse...

1123
01:43:59,770 --> 01:44:02,150
There ain't no question about it.

1124
01:44:02,246 --> 01:44:07,193
Jesse was an outlaw. A bandit. A criminal.

1125
01:44:08,167 --> 01:44:12,362
Even those that loved him
ain't got no answer to that.

1126
01:44:12,441 --> 01:44:15,024
But we ain't ashamed of him.

1127
01:44:15,107 --> 01:44:20,918
I don't know why, but I don't think
even America is ashamed of Jesse James.

1128
01:44:21,001 --> 01:44:27,907
Maybe it's because he was bold and lawless,
like we all of us like to be sometimes.

1129
01:44:27,988 --> 01:44:31,257
Maybe it's because we understand a little

1130
01:44:31,343 --> 01:44:35,774
that he wasn't altogether to blame
for what his times made him.

1131
01:44:36,469 --> 01:44:41,701
Maybe it's because for ten years
he licked the tar out of five states.

1132
01:44:42,435 --> 01:44:48,449
Or maybe it's because he was so good
at what he was doin'. I don't know.

1133
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:54,147
All I do know is he was one of
the doggonedest, goldingedest,

1134
01:44:54,229 --> 01:44:56,765
dad-blamedest buckaroos

1135
01:44:56,851 --> 01:45:01,528
that ever rode across
these United States of America.

1136
01:45:06,541 --> 01:45:11,053
"In loving remembrance, Jesse W James."

1137
01:45:11,136 --> 01:45:19,256
"Died April 3, 1882,
aged 34 years, 6 months, 28 days."

1138
01:45:19,337 --> 01:45:22,732
"Murdered by a traitor and coward

1139
01:45:22,816 --> 01:45:26,884
whose name is not worthy to appear here."
