[Horn playing "Taps"]

2
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:49,463
[Horses whinnying]

3
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:58,506
Hey! Come out! Come out!

4
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,241
[Indistinct shouting]

5
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,842
[Man] What's the excitement,
soldier?

6
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,444
Fire in the horse corral.

7
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:39,547
- [man] Mind if I take a look?
- Stay where you are, prisoner.

8
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,650
[Man] More of your
southern hospitality.

9
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,372
- Hello.
- Hello.

10
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,973
Your name Whitney Randolph?

11
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,375
Ol' Wiley Whit himself,

12
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,443
The boys in the Harvard
Glee Club used to call me.

13
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:10,844
You lose something?

14
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,446
[Man] Speaking to me?

15
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:16,850
No. No, just still
grumbling to myself.

16
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:20,788
- What do you want?
- Come with me.

17
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,189
Why should I?

18
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,992
The governor of Texas said so.
Does that mean anything?

19
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:28,596
- It most certainly does.
- Then shut up and come on.

20
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,604
- [man] Come on, hurry up.
- [Whitney] I can't
find my shoes.

21
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:39,072
[Man] Never mind
your shoes, come on.

22
00:05:58,826 --> 00:05:59,993
Halt!

23
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,901
[Dogs barking in distance]

24
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,711
- Hello, Peter.
- Why, hello, Mr. Todd.

25
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,980
Would you wake Governor Lubbock
and tell him I'm here, please?

26
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,617
Yes sir, he's up and
expecting you. Come right in.

27
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,920
Good evening.

28
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,725
Don't get up, Governor.

29
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,627
When I can't get up
to greet a friend of mine,

30
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,696
It'll be time to bury me.
How are you, Todd?

31
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,331
- Fine, sir, and you?
- Oh, as well as a man
has a right to be

32
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:39,500
In these trying times.

33
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,868
Glad to see you again,
Mr. Randolph.

34
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,770
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you, sir.

35
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,405
And, uh, thanks
for rescuing me.

36
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,741
You can thank Captain Croyden
of the Rangers.

37
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,377
I did.
He isn't having any.

38
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,146
I, uh... I don't think
he likes my Yankee accent.

39
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,750
Why should I? I'm joining
Hood's Army tomorrow.

40
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,720
[Chuckles] Don't tell me
I was rescued by a Johnny Reb.

41
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,389
Uh, gentlemen, perhaps
it'd be well for all

42
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,725
If we clarify
the atmosphere somewhat.

43
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,094
Thank you, Peter.
Help yourselves, gentlemen.

44
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,797
I take it you haven't told
Captain Croyden why you're here.

45
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:14,034
He didn't ask. He's the most
uncurious man I've ever met.

46
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,869
Governor told me
to get you and I did.

47
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,205
See what I mean?
Just like sending him

48
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,873
To the store
for a bucket of lard.

49
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,009
I think it's time you knew
that Mr. Randolph is from

50
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,945
The Department of Army
Intelligence in Washington.

51
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:29,583
Why be so tactful, Governor?
Come right out with it.

52
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,052
Captain Croyden, sir,

53
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,588
I am a Yankee spy.

54
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,991
Governor,
I never thought...

55
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,227
Oh, don't get
excited, Captain.

56
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,731
Governor Lubbock is a Texan
first, last and always.

57
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:46,934
- And a great one.
- Thank you, Mr. Randolph.

58
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,869
So, before you reach
for that gun, Todd,

59
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,404
Let me add that Mr. Randolph
is not spying on Texas

60
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,407
Or any part
of the Confederacy.

61
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,611
Todd, a week ago,
Mr. Randolph,

62
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,513
By some magic of his own,

63
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,982
Got through our lines
and came to see me.

64
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,152
He told me a story.
I agreed to help him.

65
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:08,155
I furnished him an escort,
they became separated

66
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,959
And Mr. Randolph
was picked up by a patrol
of the Confederate cavalry.

67
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,794
When I learned of it,
I sent for you,

68
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,729
And as usual,
you carried out your orders

69
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,265
With characteristic
speed and dispatch.

70
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:21,268
Speed. He didn't even
give me time to find my boots.

71
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:25,573
Mr. Randolph needs a man
to guide him into Mexico.

72
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,074
You're that man, Todd.

73
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,809
To, uh...

74
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,779
See that I don't fall
in the wrong hands again.

75
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,015
Maybe. Maybe not.

76
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,624
You mind laying your cards
on the table, mister?

77
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,659
Oh, not at all.
Not at all.

78
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,296
Everything above board,
nothing up either sleeve.

79
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,164
Did you ever hear of Juarez?

80
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:55,468
- Heard of him.
- He's a great man. A patriot.

81
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,938
- Nobody's disputin' it.
- The French are.

82
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:02,009
With an army
and by trying to put a ruler
over the Mexican people.

83
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:02,976
Your government...

84
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:06,880
Oh, I beg your pardon,
my government,

85
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,650
Has been shipping guns
and ammunition to Juarez.

86
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,452
The last three months,
we've lost two big shipments.

87
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,323
We've traced them to a town in
northern Mexico called Corrales.

88
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:20,260
A short time ago, a friend
of mine named Brooks went
down there to have a look.

89
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,363
He, um, hasn't come back.

90
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,898
Go on.

91
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:28,702
Brooks got one message through
before he disappeared.

92
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,839
Someone's raising an army
in Corrales.

93
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,774
So?

94
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,109
So it's my job to take up
where he left off.

95
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,946
You'd get me as far
as the border at least.

96
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,490
Governor, I don't like the idea
of playing nurse to a Yank.

97
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,392
Sorry to hear you
say that, Captain.

98
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:56,630
It seems a shame to break up
such a beautiful friendship.

99
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:00,901
- I got a war to fight.
- That's right, Todd, you have.

100
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,036
But you've also got
a duty to Texas.

101
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,806
Well, Texas
comes first, Governor.

102
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:07,607
That's why I'm appealing
to you, Todd.

103
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,510
And why I helped
Mr. Randolph here.

104
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,179
This army is so close
to our border,

105
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,514
It poses a threat
to our safety.

106
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:19,186
If there is danger there,
we must know it and take steps
to meet it.

107
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,854
Will you go?

108
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,162
What size boots
do you wear?

109

along the way *

113
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,279
Mind if I run my gums over it?

114
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,816
Thanks.

115

[Starts playing]

116
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,293
Very superior instrument.

117
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:36,596
Wouldn't mind
owning this myself.

118
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,331
Give you a dollar for it.

119
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,844
Wager for it.

120
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:54,014
With this, uh,
very fine piece of cutlery.

121
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,886
If you were a stranger,
I'd say no, but, uh...

122
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:00,720
Hey, just a minute.

123
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,860
[Whitney gasps]

124
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,731
Well, a man
would be a poor sport

125
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,733
If he didn't give a friend
a chance to get even.

126
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,235
Now, if you'd match
these two objects

127
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:18,638
With something of equal value,
like, say, um...

128
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:23,010
Say like that, uh,
little silver doo-dad
you're wearing there.

129

[Chuckles]

131
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,186
I've been doing some thinking,
Mr. Randolph.

132
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,822
Where I come from,
a man wouldn't think of
bringing up a matter like this,

133
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,825
But, uh...
would your feelings be hurt

134
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,828
If I kinda took a look
at those dice of yours?

135
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,797
I take it you're suspicious,
Mr. Croyden.

136
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,266
Just curious, Mr. Randolph.

137
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,168
Oh, and curious
you should be, sir,

138
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,537

to a northerner.

[Plays tune]

140
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,791
I apologize, Mr. Randolph.

141
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:47,260
Oh, your apology accepted,
Mr. Croyden.

142
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,467
I'm still curious, though.

143
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,436
You must pack
a rabbit's foot
or something.

144
00:13:56,536 --> 00:14:00,240
Just a streak of luck,
it'll run out one of these days.

145
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,410
Oh, Mr. Croyden.

146
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,345
Please be very careful
with that animal.

147
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,680
Remember, I'm just
loaning him to you.

148

[Sighs] Thanks, nurse.

150
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,000
- What for?
- For stopping.

151
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,102
I was about to choke
to death on your dust.

152
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,204
Well, you better take
a quick breather,

153
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,806
We're gonna kick up a lot more
before we cross the border.

154
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,076
There's some people
I don't want to meet up with.

155
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,611
- [Whitney] Such as?
- [Todd] Comanche Indians.

156
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,348
Confederate cavalry
rounding up deserters.

157
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,216
You mean to tell me, sir,
that there's Texans

158
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,352
Who refuse to fight
for their glorious state?

159
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:49,189
Not Texans...
Yanks who came to Texas.

160
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:52,192
I don't mind the Indians,
but Confederate cavalry,

161
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:56,463
I'd have a hard time
explaining what I'm doing
with a Yankee spy.

162
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,765
That's Confederate cavalry.

163
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,267
Let's get out of here.

164
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,328
Don't shoot,
they're friends!

165
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:33,200
You call that friendly?

166
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,916
[Whitney] Phew! Whoa!
They're turning back.

167
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,753
They had to.
That's the Rio Grande.

168
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,556
Ah. That was a close one.

169
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,659
I'd hate to be stopped
by a Texas bullet.

170
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,095
Come on.

171
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,676
Whoa.

172
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,112
[Woman speaking Spanish]

173
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,481
[Man speaking Spanish]

174
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,649
Look at all
that nice, wet water.

175
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:00,019
And look what's sitting in it,
a damsel in distress.

176
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,389
- Shall we, uh...
- [shakes dice]

177
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,757
To see who
rescues her, Mr. Croyden?

178
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:09,229
You can have her, Mr. Randolph,
I'll take the water.

179
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,469
[Man speaking Spanish]

180
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:36,123
On second thought,
I don't think I'll gamble.

181
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,158
I might win.

182
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,594
[Woman] Drop your gun belts.

183
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,801
[Woman] Drop your gun belts.

184
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,107
Drop your gun belts, I said.

185
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,090
Now you may go.

186
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,694
Thanks.

[Speaking Spanish]

190
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:39,952
Just what did she say?
In English.

191
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,321
She thinks we're bandits.

192
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,590
Well, that's
understandable.

193
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,593
But I assure you, senorita,
we are quite harmless.

194
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,163
You are now.

195
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,098
Take yourselves away.
Quick.

196
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,600
You're making a mistake.
You see...

197
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,734
Don't argue with her.

198
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,569
She waits for that army
to fix that carriage,

199
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,471
She'll be in the middle of the
stream for the rest of her life.

200
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,208
Wait.

201
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,376
Perhaps I misjudged you.

202
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,278
You did.

203
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,414
This is wild country.

204
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:08,881
A woman can't take chances.

205
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,617
No, ma'am, she can't.

206
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,552
Neither can a man
without his gun.

207
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,123
Very well, then,
I'll make a bargain.

208
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:19,592
Help us and you can
have your guns back.

209
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,495
Oh, I, uh... I don't know
if we could do that or not.

210
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:25,598
You see, you hurt our feelings
when you didn't trust us.

211
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:29,536
'Course, uh, I can't say
that I blame you when I look
at my partner here.

212
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,804
He's really not as ornery
as he looks, though.

213
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:35,508
He kinda grows on ya,
if you give him time.

214
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:38,845
I haven't that much time.
Is it a bargain?

215
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,447
It's a bargain.

216
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,633
Well, there she is,
good as new.

217
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:03,703
Thank you.
And there's your guns.

218
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,846
- Thanks.
- [Whitney] Come on,
give me a hand.

219
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,448
Coming.

220
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,225
- Wait.
- Yes, ma'am?

221
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,328
I'm on the wrong side
of the stream.

222
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,331
Why, so you are.

223
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:35,502
My mother told me not to
pick up ladies I wasn't
properly introduced to.

224
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,404
My name's Madeline Danzeeger.

225
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:41,874
Madeline.
That's a pretty name.

226
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:46,346
- Almost as pretty as you.
- You say that very gallantly.

227
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,214
Perhaps you'll be
equally gallant

228
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,417
And let me ride your horse
across the stream?

229
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,324
I'll share him with you.

230
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,526
Put your arms around my neck.

231
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,931
Put your foot
in the stirrup.

232
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,937
- Please, they're waiting.
- For what?

233
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,873
- For us.
- Oh.

234
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,678
I'd like to pay you
for your trouble.

235
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,848
That's not necessary.
It's a pleasure.

236
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,284
- That's nice perfume.
- It came from France.

237
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:27,720
If you told me your name,

238
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,656
I'd see that you were rewarded
for your kindness.

239
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:33,726
- Todd.
- Just Todd?

240
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,501
My turn, Mr. Croyden.

241
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,572
Thanks again.

242
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,076
I don't know
as I cared for that.

243
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:52,979
I do all the heavy work
and he gets all the thanks.

244
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,514
[Todd] Grab on.

245
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:05,658
What's in there, rocks?

246
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:09,362
[Whitney] It's light,
compared to the other ones.

247
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,700
Allow me.

248
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,075
Gracias.

249
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,580
Thank you.

250
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,553
I shall cherish this little
token of our meeting

251
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,121
Until my dying day.

252
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,690
Or at least until I reach
the nearest saloon.

253
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,793
You won't have it long,
Corrales is just ahead.

[Speaking Spanish]

255
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,042
I guess it's
the Texan in you.

256
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:59,546
She gives you a smile,
she gives me a peso.

257
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:01,313
That you can spend.

258
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:03,382
Ah, but I'd trade it
for a smile any day.

259
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,184
A woman's smile
is a thing of...

260
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,719
Would you stop gabbing?

261
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,921
I'm trying to
figure something out.

262
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,529
Yeah, I'm trying to figure
something out, too.

263
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,699
How do I get
my horse and guns?

264
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,969
Well, you might try wading.

265
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,463
[Long sigh]

266
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,600
Well, there she is.

267
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,869
Uh-huh. Not the sort of place
I'd choose to live in.

268
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:01,440
[Sniffs] Or die in either,
for that matter.

269
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,576
This spying business,
it, uh...

270
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,578
Wouldn't be dangerous,
would it?

271
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,347
Not a bit. The worst thing
that could happen to you

272
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,550
Is... get killed.

273
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,738
Doesn't look like much
is going on here.

274
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:35,241
Kinda empty.
Hey, where is everybody?

276
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:46,452
She says everybody's
joined the army.

277
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:48,020
Oh.

278
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:56,563
You two figurin'
settling down here?

279
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,397
Any reason why we shouldn't?

280
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,900
Nope, if there's
a reason you should.

281
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,501
We could probably
think of a few,

282
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:05,605
But we'd kind of like to
keep them to ourself.

283
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:07,874
Got any objections?

284
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,876
Nope.

285
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:23,690
[Sighs]

286
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:30,863
- [speaks Spanish]
- Beer.

287
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,870
Well, nurse,

288
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,772
Now that you've delivered me
safely to Corrales,

289
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,541
Sound of wind and limb,
you can scamper back to Texas

290
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,476
And pick up your musket.

291
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:46,646
That's just what
I'm aiming to do.

292
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:50,249
Soon as I wet my whistle
and pick up some grub.

293
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,451
I figure it won't take too long
to lick you fellas,

294
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,889
And I...
I don't wanna miss the fun.

295
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,991
Well, if you feel that you
can spare an hour or two,

296
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:03,329
I might have a message
for you to take back
to Governor Lubbock.

297
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,197
Brooks?

298
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,675
Punching cattle pays good.

299
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:18,110
Or is that too peaceful?

300
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,912
That depends.

301
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,715
- Punching for you?
- Nah.

302
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,784
Basil Danzeeger.

303
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:28,354
- Never heard of him.
- You will.

304
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,757
Stick around long enough.

305
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:37,096
Can't speak for my friend here,
but I might stick around,
after I look your town over.

306
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,832
You know where I can
get a boot repaired?

307
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,734
And a busted holster fixed?

308
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:45,437
There's a boot shop,
zapateria, down the street.

309
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,339
Much obliged.

310
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,841
You don't suppose
he hangs around

311
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,175
Just to pick up
saddle stiffs

312
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:26,112
For this man,
Danzeeger, do you?

313
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:30,049
He may be hiring, but he
ain't looking for cowhands.

314
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,753
You know, nurse, you got the
makings of a first-rate spy.

315

[Speaking Spanish]

316
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,336
The heel to the boot,
she's unstuck.

317
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:54,373
- The... [speaks Spanish]
- Oh. [Speaks Spanish]

318
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:57,176
The heel,
she's unstuck, senor.

319

[Speaking Spanish]

320
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:04,917
Speak Spanish or English.
What do you want?

321
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:25,537
I've lost a heel and my friend
would like to get
a holster fixed.

322
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,473
I am busy.

323
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:33,980
Too busy to talk to a friend
of theirs, Roberto?

324
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:40,820
President Juarez has
a great admiration for
your Abraham Lincoln.

325
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,055
What has that to do with me?

326
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,105
Take off your boot.

327
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:01,974
[Speaks Spanish]

328
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:20,159
What do you want of me,
Senor Randolph?

329
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,994
I'm looking for
a Captain Brooks.

330
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,196
Have you seen or heard
anything of him?

331
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,336
Captain Brooks is dead.

332
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,942
He was dead
when we found him.

333
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:38,377
I put up a cross.
I could do no more.

334
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,012
Thanks.

335
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,281
I do not care to
put up any more crosses,

336
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,683
Or have one put over me.

337
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,418
Nor do I.

338
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,620
Then you must work
with extreme caution.

339
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,523
There's a man named Danzeeger
behind what is going on here.

340
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,294
He has spies everywhere,
mostly renegade Americans.

341
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:56,863
You mean like that fella
at the cantina?

342
00:29:56,963 --> 00:30:00,299
Yes. He watches
the newcomers in town.

343
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,935
What do you know
of this man, Danzeeger?

344
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:05,237
It is rumored that he is
a cashiered German army officer.

345
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,706
But we know
nothing for certain.

346
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,375
Except that he
has plenty of money

347
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,143
With which to pay El Gavilan
and his soldiers.

348
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:14,646
- Who?
- El Gavilan. The Hawk.

349
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,882
That is what
General Liguras,

350
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:18,084
Who leads the army,
calls himself.

351
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:21,954
- And, uh, what of him?
- A poor, misguided fool, senor.

352
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:26,392
In these troublesome times,
any man who can
gather a thousand men

353
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,727
Will call himself a general.

354
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,863
He is, at heart,
a loyal Mexican.

355
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:33,099
Of that I am sure.

356
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:35,101
But he's not
an educated man

357
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:38,237
- and could easily be misled.
- [Whitney] By Danzeeger?

358
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,739
- Who else?
- [hoofbeats approaching]

359
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,841
[Speaking Spanish]

360
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:55,054
There, you see for yourself.
The Hawk returns with
the payroll for his army.

361
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:57,289
There will be dancing
in the streets tonight,

362
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:00,292
As there always is
when the soldiers are paid.

363
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,596
Sit down, please.
They are coming here.

364
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:13,672
Pick up boots for El Gavilan.

365
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:16,108
- They are ready, muchacho?
- They are ready, General.

366
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,478
Pedro, my boots.
[sighs]

367
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,914
[Grunts]

368
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,218
[Loud grunt]

369
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:30,156
Oh! These are the best of all.

370
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,491
You have done well, muchacho.

371
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,060
Pedro.

372
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,164
[Liguras groaning]

373
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:43,202
[Speaks Spanish, laughs]

374
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:50,209
Ah! [Speaks Spanish]

375
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,512
You make another pair for
Liguras right away, eh?

376
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,181
[Speaks Spanish]

377
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,984
The boots.

378
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,952
- You take these.
- [speaks Spanish]

379
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:02,388
Adios, Roberto.

380
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:27,346
Now that General Liguras
is a man of wealth,

381
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,149
He buys a new pair of boots
each month.

382
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:32,284
Well, at least
we know his weakness.

383
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,587
You never can tell when a thing
like that will pay off.

384
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,357
Agreed. What are your plans?

385
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:42,394
I'd like to start with
a visit to Brooks' grave.

386
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:45,031
Meet me a mile south
of town in an hour

387
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,898
And I will take you there.

388
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:48,534
If you need any lodgings,

389
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:51,803
See the good Senora Alvarez
and tell her I sent you.

390
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,472
Thank you, Roberto.

391
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:27,239
We saw the buzzards circling
even before he was dead.
That's how we found him.

392
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:31,377
He spoke more like an
Englishman than an American.

393
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:34,546
A transplanted Englishman,
Roberto.

394
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:37,083
What had they done to him?

395
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:39,651
They tied him
between wild horses.

396
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,587
An old Indian custom.

397
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:44,956
But this was not
the work of Indians.

398
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:47,826
The thongs that tied him
were not deer hide,

399
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:51,130
They were rope.
American rope.

400
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,200
There is no worse torture.

401
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,535
The headlong fight
of wild and broken Mustangs,

402
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:59,571
Pulling at the arms and legs
of the man tied between them,

403
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:03,242
Is more than human courage
can endure.

404
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:04,976
When the arms are pulled
from their sockets...

405
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:06,412
Who did it?

406
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,116
One dares not ask.

407
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:13,252
One can only grope in the dark
for the answer.

408
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,590
I see an army gathering
in the mountains.

409
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:24,963
I see the pockets of honest
field workers turned soldiers
lined with silver.

410
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,567
And I hear a general boast that
he will lead an army into Tejas,

411
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:32,904
When guns and ammunitions
come from Presidente Juarez.

412
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,874
The governor was right.

413
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,576
Do they speak of
this plan openly?

414
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,778
[Roberto] Oh, yes.

415
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,147
Oh...

416
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:45,050
No, there's more to this
than meets the eye.

417
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:48,520
Brooks was not killed
for finding that out.

418
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,291
Juarez has hardly enough
guns and ammunition
to defend himself.

419
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:56,061
Why should he send them
to this... this Liguras?

420
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:58,330
Besides, Juarez is
building for the future,

421
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,500
He's not concerned
with the past.

422
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,869
No. No, my friend,

423
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:06,372
Brooks was not killed
for that.

424
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:08,039
He was killed
for something else.

425
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,477
Agreed, amigo, but no word
comes from Juarez himself.

426
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,379
He is bottled up
by the French,

427
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:16,882
Yet Danzeeger says
he's an agent from Juarez.

428
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,251
I do not believe him.

429
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:23,121
I don't think Brooks
believed him either.

430
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:25,257
That's why they killed him.

431
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:35,501
[Todd] Odd that an
Englishman should be
fighting for your cause.

432
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,536
Not so odd.

433
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,338
"To count the life
of battle good"

434
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:42,441
And dear the land
that gave you birth.

435
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,410
And dearer yet
the brotherhood

436
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,479
"That binds the brave
of all the earth."

437
00:35:56,154 --> 00:36:01,159
Well, you've got
your message, nurse,
you can leave anytime now.

438
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,595
Who said anything
about leaving?

439
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,341
[Mexican music playing]

440
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:57,249
- Tequila.
- [man speaks Spanish]

441
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,327
[Bartender] Gracias.

442
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:32,418
Decide to stick around?

443
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,021
How about your friend?

444
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:38,957
We hit the same trail,

445
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,760
We don't ask each other where
we've been or where we're going.

446
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,962
Or why.

447
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:45,631
A fellow lives longer
that way.

448
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:48,634
He sure does
in this town.

449
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:52,638
Wrap yourself in your
own tarp, I always say.

450
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,679
We've, uh...
met before someplace.

451
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,281
I've been there.

452
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:06,251
- Laredo, maybe?
- Could be.

453
00:38:06,352 --> 00:38:09,655
A man who makes his living with
a rope and a saddle gets around.

454
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:13,291
It's been quite a bunch
of years since I saw ya.

455
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:19,431
What were you saying about
wrapping yourself
in your own tarp?

456
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,933
We were talking.

457
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,002
That's very good,
you're fast.

458
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,937
Now put it back to bed.

459
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,407
In the last couple of years,

460
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:30,442
My shoulders got itchy
around strangers.

461
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,311
Best thing is to stop
being strangers, then.

462
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:34,813
This is Red Hyatt,

463
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:38,917
Does the hiring and firing
for Mr. Danzeeger.

464
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,952
Whatever he's been drinking
for Mr. Hyatt.

465
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:44,322
I might want him
to hire me sometime.

466
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:47,559
Did you, uh,
think of a name maybe?

467
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:52,798
- How about Jones?
- I'm usin' it.

468
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:56,067
- Smith?
- [Red] We got three of 'em.

469
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,337
And I'm Brown.

470
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,208
How about Todd?
Anybody here named Todd?

471
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:06,311
- Todd what?
- Just Todd.

472
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:08,747
My mother was
closed-mouthed, too.

473
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,549
Well...

474
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:12,551
Well, you gentlemen got more
out of him in your first meeting

475
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:17,456
Than I did eating out of
the same frying pan with him
for two weeks.

476
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:20,859
- Nice to know you, Mr. Todd.
- Hello.

477
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,297
Since curiosity seems to be
a disease around these parts,

478
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:28,734
I shall cure it forthwith.

479
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,703
- Mm. I'll have one of these.
- [man speaks Spanish]

480
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,539
My name is Whitney Randolph.

481
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:36,007
I am not seeking occupation
of an outdoor nature

482
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,510
And I frown on the
indiscriminate use of firearms.

483
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:44,616
Gracias. The latter being
the chief reason
for my presence here.

484
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,454
Have you a dice cup, muchacho?

485
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:52,791
Now, anything else, gentlemen,

486
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,761
Before I lure someone
into a game of chance?

487
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:58,564
Is that how
you make your living?

488
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,432
Know a better way, friend?

489
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,568
Yeah, poker.

490
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:03,802
You can play it
sitting down.

491
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,637
Ah, a man after my own heart,

492
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,740
Hating even the slightest
suggestion of exercise.

493
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,975
Dice...

494
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,014
While a
fascinating pastime...

495
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,585
How do you do?

496
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:22,287
Does overdevelop the muscles
of the throwing arm

497
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:24,456
And put calluses on the knees.

498
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:27,826
Now, it, uh, just so happens...

499
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:32,864
No hard feelings, but I
like the cards here better.

500
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:35,333
The backs got prettier
pictures on them.

501
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,903
An art lover appears
in the wilderness.

502
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:39,871
Shall we?

503
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,079
I'll peg you yet.

504
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,517
Keep working on it.

505
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,734
- Hello.
- Hi.

506
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,805
[Hoofbeats approaching]

507
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:30,055
[Woman laughing]

508
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,860
Hello. Remember me?

509
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,563
Without the whiskers, I mean.

510
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:39,631
Yes, of course.

511
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,166
Uh... This is Mr...

512
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:44,335
- Todd's the name.
- Mr. Danzeeger.

513
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,038
I found your daughter sitting
in the middle of a creak

514
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,841
With a broken wheel
on her carriage.

515
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:51,943
Oh?

516
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:55,814
My daughter didn't
mention the incident.

517
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:58,984
Oh, it was nothing, really.
Not worth mentioning.

518
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:02,287
Nevertheless, I'm very happy
to be able to thank Mr., uh...

519
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:03,722
Todd, you said the name was?

520
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,957
[Todd] That's as good as any.
Isn't it?

521
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:08,627
It's as good
or better than most.

522
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,495
You know, there aren't
very many men around here

523
00:42:10,596 --> 00:42:14,265
That I'd care to trust
with my daughter, Mr. Todd.

524
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,501
[Todd] I can understand that.

525
00:42:16,602 --> 00:42:19,170
[Danzeeger] You plan to
stay long in Corrales?

526
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:22,107
If the climate agrees with me.

527
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,442
My health wasn't
too good up north.

528
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,312
- How far north?
- Texas.

529
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:30,716
There's a war on up there.
Or... hadn't you heard?

530
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:33,719
Oh, yes. Yes, I've heard.

531
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:36,154
You, being a peace-loving man,
came to Corrales

532
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:39,457
In preference to, uh,
fighting, is that it?

533
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:43,729
- That's about it.
- I have a number of men
in my employ who, uh,

534
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,731
Feel the same way about it.

535
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:50,068
Perhaps our Mr. Hyatt here can
talk you into working for me?

536
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,838
I think I could be argued
into that without...

537
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:55,774
- too much trouble.
- [Danzeeger] Good.

538
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:58,810
- [speaking Spanish]
- [shouting, cheering]

539
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,993
You will honor me
with a dance?

540
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,162
I'm very sorry,
General, but...

541
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,965
Well, I'm rather tired after
my long trip from Monterrey.

542
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:22,367
Excuse me, won't you?
We were just leaving.

543
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:24,102
[Danzeeger] You understand,
I'm sure, General.

544
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:26,304
Si, I understand.
The lady is tired.

545
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:29,607
- Buenas noches.
- Buenas noches, General.

546
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,209
Guillermo.

547
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:42,420
* Oh, I come from Alabama
with a banjo on my knee *

548
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,225
* I come from Alabama
My true love for to see *

549
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:49,828
* Oh, Susanna...

550
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:54,733
* Oh, Susanna
Don't you cry for...*

551
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,367
[Door opening]

552
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:01,506
Oh, good night,
Senora Alvera.

553
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:05,877
- And, uh, gracias.
- [woman speaks Spanish]

554
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:11,482
I'd have been here sooner,
only my companions
were careful players.

555
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:15,954
They were as reluctant
to part with their words
as they were with their wages.

556
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:21,960
I guess I'd never make
a first-rate spy.

557
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,295
Not good enough
at gambling.

558
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,132
I'll give you another lesson
one of these days.

559
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:30,101
If we're both still
alive and kicking.

560
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:31,703
Somebody...

561
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:36,307
Somebody's playing an
awful rough game up here.

562
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,443
Somebody named Danzeeger?

563
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:44,750
Danzeeger, Liguras,
perhaps both.

564
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:48,954
At any rate, it's Liguras
who winds up with the chips.

565
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:51,923
Did you find out
anything else?

566
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:56,427
Uh-huh. Liguras' force
numbers about 1,500 men,

567
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,363
Most of 'em unarmed.

568
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:03,401
Give these a gentle rinsing,
will you, nursey?

569
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:07,272
And get blood poisoning?

570
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,808
Anything else?

571
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:12,243
Several interesting things.

572
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:15,613
It, uh, took me a little longer
than I expected,

573
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,816
But I finally found out
what I wanted to know.

574
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:19,584
[Sniffs] Roberto was right,

575
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:24,689
Liguras is waiting for guns
and ammunition from Juarez.

576
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:28,894
- Hm. Heliotrope.
- Wait a minute.

577
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:31,029
Didn't you just lose
two big shipments of arms?

578
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:33,865
Didn't you trace them here?
Well...

579
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:36,768
Every once in a while,
you meet a bright Texan.

580
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:38,736
You're right again.

581
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:41,940
Somebody is double-crossing
somebody.

582
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,009
The question is
who's doing it to who?

583
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:48,980
Hm... [tsks] "To whom,"
my uncouth friend, "to whom."

584
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:54,085
Well, I know that I'll lay my
hard-earned pesos on Danzeeger.

585
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,721
What's he doing with
a private army of thugs?

586
00:45:56,822 --> 00:46:00,425
And where does he get the money
to pay Liguras and his soldiers?

587
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:03,995
- Just what is he up to?
- When you find that out,

588
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,465
You'll find out who killed
your friend Brooks. And why.

589
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,669
That's exactly what
I mean, Mr. Croyden.

590
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,872
Eh? What do you say?

591
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:16,441
Shall, uh, we have a look?

592
00:46:18,043 --> 00:46:21,346
I'll cover Danzeeger.
He offered me a job.

593
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,081
Good. I'll take Liguras.

594
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:25,616
Oh, by the way, have you
recalled where Hyatt met you?

595
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:26,985
Yeah. [Chuckles]

596
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:28,453
I got a better memory
than he's got.

597
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:31,389
El Paso bank hold-up.
I threw a slug at him.

598
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,391
He should be packing a piece
of lead in him somewhere.

599
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:36,661
He was, uh,
running away at the time.

600
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:38,096
Oh.

601
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:42,433
Seems to me you're taking
quite a chance, son.

602
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,369
Didn't you say the worst thing
that could happen to you

603
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,804
In the spy business
is getting killed?

604
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:50,575
Ooh. [Groans]

605
00:46:50,675 --> 00:46:52,577
Water. Where's water?

606
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:54,012
Oh, here. I'll get it.

607
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:00,085
Well, give it to me.

608
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:28,179
Keep a straight line.
Keep in formation!

609
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:30,181
At least they make
a frightening noise.

610
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:33,084
They're supposed
to be cavalry men.

611
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,223
[Guns firing]

612
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,715
Mr. Todd,
men come to Corrales

613
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,985
For two reasons.

614
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:08,987
Sometimes they're chased
across the border,

615
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:10,821
These men I can use.

616
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:12,958
Sometimes they're sent
across the border,

617
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:15,060
These men I can't use.

618
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,929
[Chuckles] You should have seen
the chunk of border I crossed.

619
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:21,933
Mm, yes,
perhaps I should have.

620
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:25,971
Listen, mister.
I came here looking for work.

621
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:29,474
All I ask is...
what's the pay?

622
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:32,177
Pay's good.
A man can become rich.

623
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:35,180
That's what this man
would like to become.

624
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,749
No curiosity about
my little army?

625
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:42,887
You want a private army of
your own, that's your business.

626
00:48:42,988 --> 00:48:44,990
You want to hire me, fine.

627
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,924
You don't want to hire me,

628
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:49,494
- that's fine, too.
- [laughs]

629
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,429
I like incurious men.

630
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:54,099
But there are some things
you'll find out.

631
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:57,302
I'm an agent
of the Mexican government.

632
00:48:58,169 --> 00:48:59,337
You don't object to that?

633
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,106
Just as long as
your money's good.

634
00:49:01,206 --> 00:49:02,640
Perhaps you'll
change your mind

635
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,010
When you find
the regular picture.

636
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,649
My orders are to wait until
Texas is left unguarded,

637
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:14,252
Then move in and take over.

638
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:16,154
For who?

639
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,258
Mexico, of course.

640
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:24,895
With, uh, that bunch
I saw out there?

641
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:27,065
They'll serve as scouts
for General Liguras,

642
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,234
- he has 1,500 men.
- You'll need more than that.

643
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:31,302
Believe me,
when the time comes,

644
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:34,205
There'll be many more
than 1,500.

645
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:38,409
Does that set well with you?

646
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:42,980
I still say...
what's the pay?

647
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:45,583
There's more than money in it.
There's land.

648
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:49,754
You have no objections to owning
a piece of Texas, have you?

649
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:51,322
Not if it's a big piece.

650
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:55,993
There are very many acres,
there are very few of us.

651
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:58,596
If I were a curious man,
which I'm not,

652
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,831
I'd wonder what the people
of Texas will be thinking

653
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,468
When you move an army
into their state.

654
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:07,205
They're quite busy at the
moment, fighting a civil war.

655
00:50:07,305 --> 00:50:10,741
Too busy to give
the matter much thought.

656
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,677
I see what you mean.

657
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:17,048
Well, I'll, uh...
put my horse away

658
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:19,584
And stash my gear.

659
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,186
You do that.

660
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,259
[Door closes]

661
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,489
Fancy bunkhouse you got here.

662
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:35,660
We like to make our men
feel at home.

663

[Men shouting in Spanish]

[Speaks Spanish]

665
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,168
I have here a
very fine selection
of merchandise for you.

666
00:52:17,268 --> 00:52:21,606
[Speaks Spanish]
I may enter, yes?

667
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:25,843
No, senor.

Gracias, gracias.

[Speaking Spanish]

673
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,889
Gracias, gracias.

674
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:05,810
[Soft guitar playing]

675
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:37,908
Pretty music, isn't it?

676
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:43,914
Yeah.

677
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:46,050
Woke me up.

678
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:49,920
I wasn't sleeping too good.

679
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,255
Too closed-in up there,

680
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:53,624
I thought maybe I'd
find me a haystack.

681
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:54,925
That so?

682
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:01,198
I don't like
walls and fences.

683
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,869
Too many of 'em in Texas,
that's why I came south.

684
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,871
Maybe I should've
kept going.

685
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:09,039
Oh, we wouldn't want that.

686
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:12,343
- "We?"
- Yeah.

687
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:13,711
Me and Danzeeger.

688
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:16,381
Him for one reason,
me for another.

689
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:17,948
You know, there's something
been worrying me

690
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:22,019
Like a burr in a saddle blanket
worries a horse.

691
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,654
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

692
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:25,423
Where have I seen you before?

693
00:55:25,523 --> 00:55:29,193
I'd like to have you stick
around till I figure it out.

694
00:55:29,293 --> 00:55:32,697
And, uh... Danzeeger?

695
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:35,400
Oh, maybe he just wouldn't
like to lose a good man.

696
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,235
Why don't you ask him?

697
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,837
I will.

698
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:43,173
I know, touchy shoulder.

699
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,309
But don't try to saddle up.

700
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,111
The boys have got orders.

701
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:55,119
Much obliged.

702
00:56:23,347 --> 00:56:26,150
Forgive me for
coming here, I had to.

703
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:29,454
Did you?

704
00:56:29,554 --> 00:56:32,122
I wanted to speak
to you alone.

705
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:36,093
I... I see you're
angry with me.

706
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:38,496
I... I shouldn't have come.

707
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,365
All right, you're here.

708
00:56:41,466 --> 00:56:42,733
What do you want?

709
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,202
That's what I came to ask you.

710
00:56:45,302 --> 00:56:48,305
What are you here for?

711
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,876
- Hyatt put me here.
- No, in Corrales.

712
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:53,678
Why does anyone
come to Corrales?

713
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:55,379
But you're not like the rest.

714
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,214
They're thieves and worse.

715
00:56:57,314 --> 00:57:00,384
They would have robbed a woman
at the stream, a lone woman.

716
00:57:00,485 --> 00:57:02,987
With a rifle in her hand?

717
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:06,857
They would not have
allowed a woman to
go unmolested, Mr. Todd.

718
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:11,061
Maybe I didn't see
anything I wanted.

719
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,732
No.

720
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:18,402
I saw the look in your eyes
when you lifted me
on your horse.

721
00:57:18,503 --> 00:57:21,038
They seemed to like
what they saw.

722
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,544
Why is everybody
watching me?

723
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:28,913
Because they're
afraid of you.

724
00:57:30,515 --> 00:57:33,183
Just as they were afraid
of a man named Brooks.

725
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:37,054
They put him in this room.

726
00:57:40,057 --> 00:57:41,992
What about Brooks?

727
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:44,228
I only know they
were afraid of him,

728
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:45,630
So he was killed.

729
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:48,633
Why are you telling me this?
Why should you?

730
00:57:48,733 --> 00:57:50,835
Yes, why should I?

731
00:57:50,935 --> 00:57:54,572
You're nothing to me.
A man I've known only a moment.

732
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:59,109
There's been too much killing
of innocent people already.

733
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:02,179
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

734
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:04,849
To me or to your father?

735
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:07,918
Look, I took great risk
in coming here, Mr. Todd,

736
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:10,454
- you must believe me.
- Why should I?

737
00:58:10,555 --> 00:58:12,489
I don't know
anything about you.

738
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,659
Except you can tie
a man's stomach in knots

739
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:16,761
And make his tongue feel
as thick as a saddle blanket.

740
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:20,364
- I must go.
- Maybe that's all right,

741
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:22,266
Providing you feel
the same way.

742
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:24,368
You must let me go, Hyatt
is watching you every moment.

743
00:58:24,468 --> 00:58:28,338
He has good reason to, he's
trying to remember something.

744
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:31,141
Like the name
Croyden perhaps?

745
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,344
I heard your friend
mention it at the stream.

746
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:36,480
You've got a good memory.

747
00:58:36,581 --> 00:58:38,749
Go away and I'll forget.

748
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:42,219
Maybe I can make you forget.

749
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:04,308
Would you please...

750
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,878
Help me down?

751
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:19,289
Thank you.

752
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:30,434
Stay close,
I'm going into town.

753
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:32,670
The shoemaker brought word
that Jones is having trouble

754
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:36,974
With some of our men.
I should be back by morning.

Senor, would you mind
tightening my saddle girth?

757
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:58,195
Your friend went to
Liguras' camp two days ago

758
00:59:58,295 --> 01:00:01,866
And he hasn't been seen
or heard of since.

759
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:03,968
Thanks.

760
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:07,237
- All right?
- Gracias, senor.

761
01:00:30,828 --> 01:00:32,262
Hey, put that fire out!

762
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:35,199
Stay away from this building,
you know the orders!

763
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:39,003

get some water up here!

There's somebody in here
and he better come out
with his hands high.

Croyden, Texas Rangers,
El Paso,

my back hurts.

That's a pretty song.

787
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:16,380
It's an old French love song.

788
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,018
- French?
- I learned it at school
in Paris.

789
01:05:21,118 --> 01:05:25,155
It will always
remind me of... someone.

790
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,591
A girl in Texas, perhaps?

791
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:29,726

792
01:05:29,826 --> 01:05:31,828

- No, don't promise.

You'd be foolish
enough to try,

Because, General,
he's found out who we are.

862
01:10:14,278 --> 01:10:17,314
And he thinks
that you oughta know, too.

863
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:20,850
- I hope he's right.
- You're wasting time. Tell him.

864
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:24,354
[Sighs] Well, I have a distinct
feeling that the water's going
to be awfully cold,

865
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:26,623
But, uh, here goes.

866
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:30,394
General, I'm an agent of
the United States government,

867
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:34,498
And, uh, this...
this brash, young
fellow here is a...

868
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:40,003
- He's a Texas Ranger.
- Ranger, eh?

869
01:10:40,103 --> 01:10:41,871
You come to spy on El Gavilan?

870
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:45,809
Well, now, let's not
put it that way, General,
it's just that...

871
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:47,644
Well, when one country
sees a friendly neighbor

872
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,280
Raising an army
on her borders, she...

873
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,115
Well, naturally, she...

874
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:55,218
You can't blame her
for being... curious.

875
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:58,422
So we were sent down here
to see what's going on.

876
01:10:58,522 --> 01:11:01,124
I will tell you
what is going on.

877
01:11:01,224 --> 01:11:02,892
But afterward, you must die.

878
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:06,596
For then you will know
El Gavilan's plans.

879
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:09,165
You still wish to know, senores?

880
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,668
Ah, I see you
do not want to die,

881
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:15,305
But it is no matter,
I tell you all the same.

882
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:18,342
El Gavilan will sweep down
on the Tejanos

883
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:20,444
And take the land, so!

884
01:11:20,544 --> 01:11:22,712
Then he will give it
back to Mexico.

885
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:26,082
Or maybe he will
keep it for Liguras.

886
01:11:26,182 --> 01:11:27,617
Now you know.

887
01:11:27,717 --> 01:11:30,520
And, while the Hawk
is sweeping down on Texas,

888
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,256
Just what do you think
an old bird called the Eagle

889
01:11:33,357 --> 01:11:34,791
Is going to be doing?
Sleeping?

890
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:36,693
Your people are too busy
fighting each other,

891
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,128
They will have
no time for Liguras.

892
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,897
He will fight
and he will win.

893
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:44,668
Or maybe he will die.
It makes no difference.

894
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:47,471
They will celebrate
in the villages.

895
01:11:47,571 --> 01:11:51,541
The people will build
big statues to Juarez.

896
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:55,345
And perhaps they will build
little one for Liguras.

897
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:57,381
Who knows?

898
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:02,686
They don't build statues
to traitors, General,

899
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:07,357
- they hang 'em.
- I, Liguras, a traitor?

900
01:12:07,457 --> 01:12:09,025
[Todd] You will be
if you fight for Danzeeger.

901
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,461
He's an agent
of the French government.

902
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:13,497
Well, so you finally
figured it out, too.

903
01:12:13,597 --> 01:12:14,598
It wasn't too hard.

904
01:12:14,698 --> 01:12:16,533
This is some sort of trick,

905
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:18,001
I do not believe you.

906
01:12:18,101 --> 01:12:20,236
[Whitney] No, General,
it's no trick, it's the truth.

907
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,572
Where do you think Danzeeger
gets the money

908
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,674
That he pays you
and your soldiers?

909
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:27,744
- From Juarez, senor!
- No, General.

910
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:30,179
That money comes from
the French agent in Monterrey.

911
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:34,851
And it's brought
into Corrales by the
beautiful Madeline Danzeeger.

912
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:37,721
Yes. In trunks so heavy

913
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:39,923
That it takes two full-grown
nitwits to help lift them

914
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:44,093
- into a carriage.
- You sure?

915
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:47,397
Just as sure as I am that the
perfume she wears is French.

916
01:12:47,497 --> 01:12:51,668
No! Danzeeger is
a friend to Mexico.

917
01:12:51,768 --> 01:12:55,472
When the guns and ammunition
arrive from Juarez, we march!

918
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:57,641
He has given his word!

919
01:12:57,741 --> 01:13:00,376
The guns are already here,
General.

920
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:02,378
But they're not from Juarez,

921
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:04,481
They're French guns
and stolen American guns

922
01:13:04,581 --> 01:13:06,783
- intended for Juarez.
- You saw them?

923
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:10,654
- Enough to outfit a regiment.
- You're a very big liar, senor.

924
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:14,157
If Danzeeger has guns,
why he don't tell Liguras?

925
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:15,992
Because he's working
for the French!

926
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:18,061
I don't know what, but he's
got some kind of a trap.

927
01:13:18,161 --> 01:13:20,464
When he's ready to spring it,
you'll get your guns,

928
01:13:20,564 --> 01:13:23,199
And you'll be in the trap.

929
01:13:23,299 --> 01:13:25,735
You can prove this, senores?

930
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:32,642
General, you'll have
to take our word.

931
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:36,780
No, no, it's not enough.
I must see proof.

932
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,949
I go to Danzeeger.

933
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:43,487
If what you tell me is true,
I kill him.

934
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:51,160
If what you tell me
is not true, I kill you.

935
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,531
[Liguras speaking Spanish]

936
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:56,900
We can't let Liguras
go with us.

937
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,403
If he gets his hands on those
guns, he'll march right now.

938
01:14:00,504 --> 01:14:02,539
And then it's,
"Look out, Texas."

939
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:04,073
Get one thing straight,

940
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,810
If it wasn't for the girl,
I wouldn't be here.

941
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:09,078
If there's any rough stuff...

942
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:12,248
I have ordered the horses.

943
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:16,319
But first,
senores, we drink.

944
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:20,023
To Presidente Juarez.

945
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:22,258
You love him very much,
don't you, General?

946
01:14:22,358 --> 01:14:24,928
I lay down my life for him.

947
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:26,262
You know, General,

948
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:27,463
If you love him, stay alive.

949
01:14:27,564 --> 01:14:30,466
He needs brave men
like you to, uh...

950
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:31,735
To help fight his enemies.

951
01:14:31,835 --> 01:14:34,604
You do not say
what you mean, Yankee.

952
01:14:35,672 --> 01:14:37,473
You're very smart, General.

953
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:39,242
But Danzeeger is smart, too.

954
01:14:39,342 --> 01:14:42,011
He doesn't want you to know
that he's working
for the French.

955
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:44,748
That's why he had
the man Brooks killed.

956
01:14:44,848 --> 01:14:46,049
If you face him now,
he would lie.

957
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:48,718
He'd even destroy
the proof of his guilt.

958
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:51,454
- What do you want me to do?
- Stay here.

959
01:14:51,555 --> 01:14:53,222
Let us bring
the proof to you.

960
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,592
Then he can't
lie his way out.

961
01:14:57,661 --> 01:15:00,363
It is agreed. I stay here.

962
01:15:00,463 --> 01:15:02,265
And now, senores...

963
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:05,902
To Juarez.

964
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:14,143
And no tricks, Tejano,
my men are everywhere.

965
01:15:15,579 --> 01:15:17,080
Senor...

966
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,049
My boots.

967
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:24,020
Little big, perhaps,
but better than the bare foot.

968
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:26,189
I'm flattered.

Here's the powder,
it's all I could get.

972
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:53,950
It'll be enough.

973
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:57,286
Meet us at Danzeeger's place
tomorrow at 12:00 sharp.

974
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:58,521
And bring Liguras
and his men.

975
01:15:58,622 --> 01:16:00,423
I will be there.
Be careful.

976
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:03,860

1029
01:23:05,948 --> 01:23:07,483
If I have to shoot, I will.

1030
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:09,685
Give me the letter.

1031
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:14,690
[Gun fires]

1032
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:16,159
[Shouts]

1033
01:23:19,028 --> 01:23:20,296
Thank you, my dear.

1034
01:23:20,396 --> 01:23:22,598
You've reestablished
my faith in you somewhat.

1035
01:23:22,698 --> 01:23:25,434
There was a moment or two in
the past few days, I must admit,

1036
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:29,972
I thought I'd lost your
affections to this
charming Texas spy.

1037
01:23:30,073 --> 01:23:31,974
Captain Croyden, my wife.

1038
01:23:32,075 --> 01:23:34,477
- We've met.
- Oh?

1039
01:23:34,577 --> 01:23:37,646
She told you. In that case,
there's nothing more to be said.

1040
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:41,084
- Will you take over, Mr. Hyatt?
- With pleasure.

1041
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,552
All right, Captain Croyden.

1042
01:23:49,925 --> 01:23:51,460
What will they do with him?

1043
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:55,598
I, uh, imagine Mr. Hyatt
has ideas on the subject.

1044
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:05,040
- Thank you.
- Oh, let him go.

1045
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:07,443
Send him to Mexico City
and hold him a prisoner.

1046
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:10,679
You're scarcely in a bargaining
position, my dear.

1047
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:12,515
Please?

1048
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:20,223
Losing one's head in this
business is dangerous enough.

1049
01:24:20,323 --> 01:24:22,758
Losing one's heart is worse.

1050
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,695
I'll see that he's not harmed.

1051
01:24:35,371 --> 01:24:38,541
[Todd grunting, straining]

1052
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,655
Tie him off good.

1053
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:56,725
I don't want him to drag
and get his brains beaten out.

1054
01:25:01,797 --> 01:25:04,133
I want to make sure you know
what's happening to you

1055
01:25:04,233 --> 01:25:06,435
When they pull you to pieces.

1056
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:09,772
You all right down there?

1057
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,175
All ready, Red.

1058
01:25:12,275 --> 01:25:15,344
[Red] Stand clear
when I say go.

1059
01:25:20,483 --> 01:25:22,218
Comfortable, Captain?

1060
01:25:22,318 --> 01:25:24,387
I'm surprised an old
campaigner like yourself

1061
01:25:24,487 --> 01:25:26,054
Should fall for
a woman's smile.

1062
01:25:26,155 --> 01:25:27,990
An old sod. [Tsks]

1063
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:31,627
Well, there seems nothing
left to say but goodbye.

1064
01:25:35,298 --> 01:25:36,732
- [men shouting]
- [gunshots]

1065
01:25:36,832 --> 01:25:38,834
[Men hooting, cheering]

1066
01:25:47,743 --> 01:25:49,178
Whoa!

1067
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,405
Whoa, boy!

1068
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,707
Ho!

1069
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:22,578
Come on!

1070
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:40,563
Hang on, nurse!

1071
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:47,270
If I cut you loose on this
side, can you swing up?

1072
01:26:47,803 --> 01:26:49,572
I'll try.

1073
01:27:02,785 --> 01:27:04,620
Take the knife!

1074
01:27:24,139 --> 01:27:25,908
Whoa.

1075
01:27:26,008 --> 01:27:28,277
Whoa! Steady, boy.

1076
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,754
Whoa, boy.

1077
01:27:42,024 --> 01:27:44,960
Whoa, boy. Steady.

1078
01:27:49,031 --> 01:27:50,433
Hurry, Whit!

1079
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:52,701
[Gunshot]

1080
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:24,600
[Breathing heavily]

1081
01:28:25,267 --> 01:28:26,502
Hello, nurse.

1082
01:28:26,602 --> 01:28:29,004
Shut up and lie still.

1083
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:35,644
Reminds me of the...

1084
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,982
Guy who missed the top step.

1085
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:44,853
Would you mind...

1086
01:28:44,953 --> 01:28:48,691
Straightening out
my legs for me, Mr. Croyden?

1087
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:51,059
Not at all, Mr. Randolph.

1088
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:09,712
- Better?
- Yeah.

1089
01:29:09,812 --> 01:29:10,946
Thanks.

1090
01:29:16,318 --> 01:29:18,387
Wait a minute.

1091
01:29:18,487 --> 01:29:22,157
If I wanted my legs
straightened out,

1092
01:29:22,257 --> 01:29:24,927
Wouldn't I move 'em myself?

1093
01:29:29,264 --> 01:29:31,400
Oh, yeah.

1094
01:29:33,469 --> 01:29:34,837
Yeah.

1095
01:29:42,778 --> 01:29:45,113
I'll try and get
your horse for you.

1096
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:46,314
I don't need a horse.

1097
01:29:46,415 --> 01:29:49,284
I understand...

1098
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,887
We use an entirely
different kind of...

1099
01:29:51,987 --> 01:29:56,792
Transportation
where I'm going.

1100
01:29:58,661 --> 01:30:01,029
If my luck holds out.

1101
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:08,704
Sun's getting kind of high.

1102
01:30:09,705 --> 01:30:11,774
Don't forget, you got a...

1103
01:30:13,809 --> 01:30:16,244
Luncheon date with Liguras.

1104
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:17,946
I know.

1105
01:30:19,515 --> 01:30:21,917
Can I have your guns, Whit?

1106
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,622
Sure, Todd.

1107
01:30:43,506 --> 01:30:45,508
You know something, mister?

1108
01:30:46,675 --> 01:30:49,778
I've changed my mind
about a short war.

1109
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:54,617
It'll take us quite a while
to lick you Yanks.

1110
01:31:14,436 --> 01:31:17,773
- I'll be back as soon as I can.
- Sure.

1111
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:20,776
You know something funny?

1112
01:31:20,876 --> 01:31:24,547
Everything happens to me
with my boots off.

1113
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:02,284
[Danzeeger] The shadow
grows longer, General.

1114
01:32:02,384 --> 01:32:04,352
It's well past noon.

1115
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:09,658
Where are these Americans
who will bring proof
of my disloyalty to Mexico?

1116
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:12,060
Si, muchacho,

1117
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,630
Where are the men who tell
Liguras this wild story

1118
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:16,932
Of hidden guns and ammunition?

1119
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:18,934
Perhaps they were burned
in the storehouse, General.

1120
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:22,738
[Chuckles] I would destroy
valuable powder and weapons?

1121
01:32:22,838 --> 01:32:25,173
[Liguras] You have listened
to the Yankee, Roberto.

1122
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:29,211
If there are guns
I must have proof.
Where is the proof?

1123
01:32:29,311 --> 01:32:32,715
[Danzeeger] There'll be no
proof. The Americans won't come.

1124
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,384
[Liguras] I believe this.

1125
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:39,221
I ask my friend to forgive me.

1126
01:32:39,321 --> 01:32:41,990
No need
of forgiveness, General.

1127
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:44,927
Just take your men
back to camp.

1128
01:32:45,027 --> 01:32:46,328
Si, si.

1129
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:54,402
- [speaking Spanish]
- [speaks Spanish] He comes!

1130
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:56,739
[People chattering]

1131
01:32:58,306 --> 01:33:01,043
Did I not tell you that he
would keep his word, General?

1132
01:33:01,143 --> 01:33:05,681
He comes alone, like a man
who is sick or drunk.

1133
01:33:13,321 --> 01:33:16,725
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,
General, but...

1134
01:33:16,825 --> 01:33:18,661
I was unavoidably detained.

1135
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:22,164
Your friend,
he of the good luck?

1136
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:24,800
His luck ran out today.

1137
01:33:26,635 --> 01:33:28,103
He's dead.

1138
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:33,876
Thanks to him, I'm not.

1139
01:33:33,976 --> 01:33:35,510
You overlooked him, Danzeeger.

1140
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:39,281
Regrettable oversight on the
part of Mr. Hyatt, I assure you.

1141
01:33:39,381 --> 01:33:44,787
Come, Tejano, where's
the proof you promised?

1142
01:33:44,887 --> 01:33:49,591
Last night, I had a paper
in my hands signed by the
French Minister of War.

1143
01:33:49,692 --> 01:33:51,493
It said that Danzeeger
was his agent.

1144
01:33:51,593 --> 01:33:52,627
[Liguras] Well,
the paper, where is it?

1145
01:33:52,728 --> 01:33:55,630
Go on, Captain.
Show it to him!

1146
01:33:55,731 --> 01:33:58,000
- You have it, Tejano?
- No, but I saw it.

1147
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:01,603
That's why I was tied
to wild horses like Brooks.

1148
01:34:01,704 --> 01:34:03,505
He wanted to make sure
I didn't tell you.

1149
01:34:03,605 --> 01:34:06,742
- He's lying.
- The paper said that the money
that pays your troops

1150
01:34:06,842 --> 01:34:08,877
- comes from France.
- It comes from Juarez.

1151
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:12,948
[Todd] Maybe you'll believe
your own countrymen.
Tell him, Roberto.

1152
01:34:13,048 --> 01:34:14,750
Si, what say you, muchacho?

1153
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:16,885
He tells the truth.
These are with the French

1154
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:18,821
Who sent an Austrian
to be our emperor,

1155
01:34:18,921 --> 01:34:20,588
And his wife, a Belgian,
to be our empress.

1156
01:34:20,689 --> 01:34:22,357
Why did you not
tell me this before?

1157
01:34:22,457 --> 01:34:25,794
You were afraid because you
could not prove what you say?

1158
01:34:25,894 --> 01:34:28,030
Would you believe me, General,
if I told you?

1159
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:33,001
- [Danzeeger] Madeline!
- Yes, I take the lady's word.

1160
01:34:34,636 --> 01:34:35,838
The American speaks the truth.

1161
01:34:35,938 --> 01:34:37,773
- Stay out of this.
- No, I won't.

1162
01:34:37,873 --> 01:34:39,607
You promised to let him go.

1163
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:42,044
You and your troops will be
used to stop the Americans

1164
01:34:42,144 --> 01:34:44,279
- if they come to help Juarez.
- Don't listen to her!

1165
01:34:44,379 --> 01:34:47,983
You've got to listen to me.
My husband and I
are agents of the French.

1166
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:51,887
If you seize Texas, you will
take it for France, not Mexico.

1167
01:34:53,756 --> 01:34:55,090
Hurry, Captain!

1168
01:34:56,725 --> 01:34:59,728
- Todd!
- [gunshot]

1169
01:34:59,828 --> 01:35:03,431
Smith, Brown, cover us.

1170
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:08,003
- [Madeline groans]
- [gunfire continues]

1171
01:35:21,483 --> 01:35:24,753
- Take care of her, Roberto.
- I will.

1172
01:35:24,853 --> 01:35:27,122
[Shouts in Spanish]

1173
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:17,539
- Stay with your men!
- [shouts in Spanish]

1174
01:37:06,922 --> 01:37:10,959
Why you stop?
It's almost dark,
he'll get away.

1175
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:21,236
Get up!

1176
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:23,105
Come on, get up!

1177
01:37:51,566 --> 01:37:54,102
- There he is!
- Wait.

1178
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:57,439
Danzeeger!
Can you hear me?

1179
01:37:59,141 --> 01:38:02,377
- I hear you!
- You've got one chance!

1180
01:38:02,477 --> 01:38:03,611
Give up!

1181
01:38:05,113 --> 01:38:08,050
Will Liguras treat me
as a prisoner of war?

1182
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:11,619
Guarantee safe conduct
to Mexico City?

1183
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:15,290
- How about it, General?
- No, senor, he must die.

1184
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:16,824
I make no promise!

1185
01:38:16,925 --> 01:38:18,927
In that case, gentlemen,

1186
01:38:19,027 --> 01:38:20,595
Come and get me!

1187
01:38:33,008 --> 01:38:35,243
You stay here,
amigo, I get him.

1188
01:38:35,343 --> 01:38:37,179
You wouldn't get 50 feet
up that hill, General.

1189
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:40,448
- He'll slip away.
- We'll smoke him out.

1190
01:38:40,548 --> 01:38:43,718
I'll set fire
on the base of the peak
and set the draw here.

1191
01:38:43,818 --> 01:38:46,588
You cover from there
and get him when he comes out.

1192
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:50,558
He must not escape.

1193
01:38:53,828 --> 01:38:56,631
You'll get him, General.
Stay down here.

1194
01:39:04,539 --> 01:39:06,208
[Gunshot]

1195
01:40:10,305 --> 01:40:12,907
Keep your eye on that draw,
General, he'll come out like
a scared jackrabbit.

1196
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:15,210
That's the only way out.

1197
01:40:15,310 --> 01:40:18,046
The horses, senor, they'll
be frightened by the fire.

1198
01:40:18,146 --> 01:40:20,682
You will take
them away, please.

1199
01:40:53,014 --> 01:40:57,185
Liguras? Liguras!
Where are you?

1200
01:40:57,285 --> 01:40:59,954
- Here I am!
- Come back! Come back!

1201
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:01,423
No! No!

1202
01:41:35,723 --> 01:41:37,659
[Gunfire continues]

1203
01:41:58,313 --> 01:42:02,450
[Gunfire]

1204
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:31,546
Poor Liguras,
he could have been a great man.

1205
01:42:32,514 --> 01:42:34,482
He was a patriot.

1206
01:42:35,517 --> 01:42:37,719
Are there any greater?
