00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:48,973
Hold it!

171
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:52,136
Easy, Billy.
We know you're grievin'.

172
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:55,670
- We ain't lookin' for trouble.
- Well, you found it.

173
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:57,807
Next time,
it won't be your hardware.

174
00:08:57,884 --> 00:08:59,749
It'll be your head.

175
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:04,346
Aw, quit shakin', Doc!

176
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:06,119
You made me miss.

177
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:09,127
I'm sorry, Billy.
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:12,187
Set 'em up again, Red Dog.

179
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:14,028
What's up, Ragsdale?

180
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,227
I'd like a little privacy.

181
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:18,327
You, come inside.

182
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:28,778
Wonder what he's gonna do when
he finds out he's got a brother.

183
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:31,908
Don't worry about a brother
that ain't gonna show up.

184
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,111
How's that?

185
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:37,054
Boys, you got a job to do.

186
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:41,259
[Cows mooing]

187
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:44,091
ROXANNE: Marcus, look.
Something's coming.

188
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:46,427
MARCUS: Yeah.
It's a stagecoach.

189
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:48,023
The kind that gets held up.

190
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:49,090
I hope not.

191
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:50,726
Don't worry.

192
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:54,398
That's why the armory
is riding shotgun.

193
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:57,409
Eli, the stagecoach is here!

194
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:00,537
[Whistling]

195
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,046
Yah! Yah! Go on!

196
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:05,983
Get goin', now!
Yah! Yah! Hah!

197
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,815
Come on, now!

198
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,489
Whoa!

199
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:13,650
Hey, you, there.
Shake a leg.

200
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:15,785
We ain't got all day, you...

201
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:22,259
You can take as long
as you want, Billy.

202
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,532
Just say the word,
and you got all day.

203
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:26,697
I beg your pardon?

204
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:29,207
You ain't gonna get
a quarrel outta us.

205
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:31,903
See?
He dropped his gun.

206
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:36,372
Does this stagecoach
go to Bloodshy, please?

207
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:38,349
You bet your sweet life
it does.

208
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:40,283
Anyplace you say.

209
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:42,583
Bloodshy, Carson City,
Timbuktu.

210
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:45,488
You name it,
and that's where we're goin'.

211
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:47,458
We got nothin' but time.

212
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:50,325
There ain't no passengers
to bother ya.

213
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:53,456
I'd be obliged if you could
store that for me, please.

214
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:54,625
Okay.

215
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,464
Thank you.
And that one.

216
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:58,231
I'll be back in a jiffy.

217
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:00,363
You just take your time.

218
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,337
Wild Billy's talkin'
peculiar, ain't he?

219
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:05,343
Probably liquored up
from grievin'.

220
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:07,743
Should we make a run for it?

221
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:09,406
I don't know.

222
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:11,973
He probably got 'em hid
under that coat.

223
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:18,018
Right, driver.
We're all in now.

224
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,558
Yes, sir.

225
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,616
Hooo!
[Whistles] Ho!

226
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:23,525
Let's go!

227
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:25,723
Yah! Yah!
Come on, now!

228
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,697
People sure seem polite
around here.

229
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:32,101
They even call you
by your first name.

230
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:33,866
Even if it's the wrong one.

231
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,135
I've noticed.
‘Billy.’

232
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,437
I wonder why.

233
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,705
Hah hah! Come on, there!
[Whistles]

234
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:41,939
Hah! Get along, there!
Hah!

235
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:43,241
Go on, now!

236
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:46,877
Get along! Hah!
[Whistles]

237
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:50,184
Hey, get outta there!
Ho! Ho!

238
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:51,689
Ho, there!

239
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:55,660
Ho!
Ho, there!

240
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:56,956
Hey, you, there!

241
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,691
Get that thing
outta the way!

242
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:00,932
Sure.

243
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,025
But first we got
a little business.

244
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,399
Boys!

245
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:09,006
We ain't carryin' gold.

246
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:11,236
No, but you got
a passenger we want.

247
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,437
- You want him?
- Good luck.

248
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:14,673
Yeah.

249
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:18,775
I had a feelin'
we might need this.

250
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:23,114
You! Inside!

251
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:25,783
Come on out!
We got a surprise for ya!

252
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:32,226
What's he doin' out here?!

253
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:34,960
Heh. You kinda
took us by surprise.

254
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:37,434
Another one of your jokes,
Billy? Ha ha ha!

255
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,437
[Forced laughter]

256
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:44,876
Guess this one's on us.

257
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:47,811
We come all the way out here
and find out it's you.

258
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,610
I don't know who you are
or who you think I am.

259
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:54,141
But I do know
you shouldn't point that.

260
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,246
It's liable to go off
and hurt somebody.

261
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:00,020
MARCUS: Get down!

262
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,458
- Run for it!
- Out of my way!

263
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:04,996
Move it!
Run!

264
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:09,129
Let's go in the hills!

265
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:11,932
Why, he's crazy!
Let's get outta here!

266
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,642
Wow!

267
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:23,647
That was awful!

268
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:24,944
Did I tell ya?

269
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:28,748
Our first day in the West,
and we've already been held up.

270
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:31,619
We better take
this thing with us.

271
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,353
We don't want it to fall
into the wrong hands.

272
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:40,429
I'm so tired,
I can hardly walk.

273
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,197
Don't worry. When we go through
the Badlands, you'll be running.

274
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,034
We don't run, we walk.
Head high, Brother Marcus.

275
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:50,507
By holding good thoughts and
relying on the power within us,

276
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,100
our burden shall be lifted.

277
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:55,204
Do you remember that prophet
of old, Elijah?

278
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:57,374
A man of righteousness
and goodness.

279
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,281
He was sent
to his final victory,

280
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:02,912
his eternal destination,
in a fiery chariot.

281
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:04,479
WOMAN:
Whoa! Whoa there!

282
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,291
Whoa! Whoa, boy!
Whoa! Whoa, there!

283
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,885
Look out!

284
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:12,861
Are you all right?

285
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:15,992
Yes. These critters seem
to have a mind of their own.

286
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:18,935
What are you doing
in the middle of the road?

287
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:21,064
We were just walking along.

288
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,371
Are you gonna stand there
babbling or help me?

289
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:26,809
We'll help.
Give the lady a hand.

290
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:30,616
The fiery chariot.

291
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:32,583
I imagine
you could use a lift.

292
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,483
Thank you.
Where are you going?

293
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:36,488
As far as Bloodshy.

294
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:38,148
So are we.

295
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,953
First the fiery chariot,

296
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:42,460
and now she's taking us
to Bloodshy.

297
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:45,725
See? You don't have to run
if you listen to Brother Eli.

298
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:46,856
There.

299
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,264
Thank you.

300
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:50,495
Hey, I'm Jenny Willingham.

301
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,333
Are you a dance-hall girl?

302

Marcus.

303
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,337
No, I'm a schoolteacher.

304
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:57,376
How do you do?
I'm Eli Bloodshy.

305
00:14:57,443 --> 00:14:58,501
We're missionaries.

306
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:00,670
That's Roxanne,
and this is Marcus.

307
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:03,113
- Bloodshy, huh?
- It was my father's town.

308
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:06,345
He passed away, but I'm going
to collect my inheritance.

309
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:09,445
Now, am I just gonna
stand here or get that lift?

310
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:32,471
‘Put me down,’ I said!
Put me down!

311
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:45,924
Oh, Mansbridge.

312
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:47,254
Field, sir.

313
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:48,258
Oh, yeah.

314
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:50,557
What can I do for you,
Fieldbridge?

315
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,325
It's Mansfield, sir.

316
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:53,387
Oh, yeah.

317
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:56,560
Well, them English names
are all Greek to me.

318
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:58,929
[Clang]

319
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:00,529
You wanna watch it there?

320
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:04,235
I'll turn your overnight stay
into a life sentence.

321
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,508
You gotta keep your eye on 'em
so they don't fly the coop.

322
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:12,039
We had a little fire in here
thanks to Mr. Wild Billy.

323
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:15,849
One of these days, I'm gonna
put the cuffs on him for good.

324
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,523
If you don't mind, sir,

325
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:21,992
I'm looking
for Mayor Ragsdale.

326
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:23,426
Mr. Bloodshy's will.

327
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:26,988
Well, if it has to do with law,
you came to the right place.

328
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:29,125
It's to be administered
by the mayor.

329
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:30,998
Leave it to me, Mainstream.

330
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:36,798
[Clears throat]

331
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:49,915
Now, you remember
you're on your honor!

332
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,986
‘I, Jasper Bloodshy,
last will and testament,

333
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:59,395
my entire inheritance...’

334
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:00,465
It's a contest.

335
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:01,431
It is?

336
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,831
No, it isn't.

337
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:04,164
It isn't?

338
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:06,864
Not when the other contestant
can't make it.

339
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:08,099
Why can't he make it?

340
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:11,075
Because the poor sucker's
on his way...

341
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:15,806
Sheriff, don't you have
anything better to do?

342
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:16,813
No, not now.

343
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:19,476
Go out and find Wild Billy.

344
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:20,484
Wild Billy?

345
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:22,817
Tell him it's official.
He's rich.

346
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:25,322
Wild Billy?

347
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,222
It's good news, Sheriff.

348
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:29,989
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Good news.

349
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:32,121
Then maybe he won't
want a shoot-out.

350
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:33,426
I'll tell him.

351
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:36,059

ELI: Bloodshy.

00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:50,042
It's my name etched in wood.

358
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,346
So, where will you
be staying?

359
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:56,911
How about the saloon?

360
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:59,048
Children can't stay
at a saloon.

361
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:01,422
Why not? We're used to
places like that.

362
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,928
And there's a lot
of souls to save there.

363
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:06,191
I've made arrangements
at a boardinghouse.

364
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:08,199
I'm sure
they'll have room for you.

365
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:11,168
- Thank you very much.
- A boardinghouse?

366
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:14,070
That's not where all
the shooting and fighting is.

367
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,440
99.9% of all towns in the West
are peaceful little villages

368
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:20,274
where nothing ever happens.

369
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:23,247

out of your head, hmm?

Mr. Bloodshy,
are you all right?

382
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:28,845
I think so, yes.

Thank you.

This is no way

If a man is guilty
of a crime,

402
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,610
he should be judged
in a court of law,

403

Just because
these men are mean,

407
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:52,597
it doesn't mean
they won't listen to reason.

where the sheriff is?

about him bein' a twin.

a little contest involved.

What does it consist of?

523
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,100
Oh, just a little race.

524
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:06,576
[Laughing] Nothin' to be
worried about.

525
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:07,976
You come on now, Eli.

526
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:10,742
Let me show you the town
that your daddy built.

527
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,841
I'll see you later, Billy.

528
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:14,852
A little race, huh?

529
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,718
On the Bloody Bloodshy Trail.

530
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:19,552
Well, if'n I was you boys,

531
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:22,423
I'd get a few bets
down in the big city.

532
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:25,657
That a way, whilst I'm cleanin'
up on the psalm singer,

533
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:27,858
you boys
can be cleanin' out Reno!

534
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:30,401
- Yooooo-hooooo!
- [Gunshots]

535
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:35,664
That's the Bloodshy
Savings Bank.

536
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:37,971
Hasn't been open
since the last robbery.

537
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:40,511
There's not much money
in this town, parson.

538
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:43,047
I thought my father
had considerable wealth.

539
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:45,743
Yes. It's all safe
and sound in my vault there.

540
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:47,751
Don't you worry
about a thing, son.

541
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:50,049
The lunchroom's shot, too?

542
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:53,922
People around here seem to get
what they need in the saloon.

543
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:56,888
So I see.

544
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:58,987
It's the West, you see, son?

545
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:00,724
It's the wild, wild West.

546
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:02,393
Hold it.
He's here.

547
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:03,399
Who?

548
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:05,834
He is.
Rattlesnake.

549
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:08,737
But don't worry.
It's gonna be all right.

550
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:10,468
I got the edge on him.

551
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,169
You do?
Why?

552
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:13,939
Because he's here,

553
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:16,310
and he knows I know
he's here.

554
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:19,976
But he doesn't know I know
he knows I know he's here,

555
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:21,485
but I know.

556
00:27:21,553 --> 00:27:24,317
So I got the edge.

557
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:29,691
Let's leave this
up to the sheriff, son.

558
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:40,530
You're here.
I know you're here.

559
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:42,300
Yeah, I'm here, all right.

560
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:45,275
My sister says
you insulted her.

561
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:48,677
No man insults my sister
and stays alive.

562
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:51,147
Insulted her?
I asked her to marry me.

563
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:53,184
So, she was right.

564
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,776
Get ready to slap leather.

565
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:57,685
Then get ready
to bite the dust.

566
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:59,314
[Laughing]

567
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:02,224
You're fast, Denver,
but not that fast.

568
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:04,194
Nobody's that fast.

569
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:07,754
I didn't get to be the sheriff
of Bloodshy for being slow.

570
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:11,030
Draw and I'll tattoo
your name all over that sheet.

571
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:16,566
You draw and there'll be
another badge on Boot Hill.

572
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:18,973
We'll see about that.

573
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:22,138
At the count of three.

574
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,319
[Chuckling]

575
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:47,097
1.

576
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:48,332
2.

577
00:28:56,381 --> 00:28:58,349
Aah! Oh!

578
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,146
[Chuckling]

579
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:02,778
Whahh!

580
00:29:02,854 --> 00:29:04,788
Uh, uh!

581
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:06,847
It seems what
hasn't been burnt down

582
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,119
has been boarded up.

583
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:09,717
I hope the church survived.

584
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:12,787
No. The church burned down
about six months ago.

585
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:14,388
The church as well?

586
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:16,525
Perhaps I can speak
to your minister.

587
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:20,037
Well, yeah. You probably passed
him on the way into town.

588
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:22,096
All we passed
was a little cemetery.

589
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:26,110
That great big gray tombstone?
That was him.

590
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:28,339
You beginning
to get the picture, boy?

591
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:31,177
It's the classic picture
of a town on its knees.

592
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:33,080
Yes, exactly.
Exactly.

593
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:36,018
Even if you do win that race,
look around you here.

594
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:38,147
- What have you got?
- What have I got?

595
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:41,454
I've got the most marvelous
opportunity a man could have.

596
00:29:41,526 --> 00:29:45,519
Thank you for the most
inspiring walk of my life.

597
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:47,497
What?

598
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:48,794
Jenny?

599
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:50,664
In here.

600
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:53,898
Jenny, fate took us by the hand
when it led us out here.

601
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:56,805
Everywhere you turn,
there's a golden opportunity.

602
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,103
What are you doing?

603
00:29:58,176 --> 00:30:00,269
Packing.
It goes along with leaving.

604
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,006
Which is what
I'm going to do.

605
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,241
But there's a real job
to be done here.

606
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:07,615
What job? The school
burnt down six months ago.

607
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,745
All the more reason
we're needed.

608
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:11,345
To start a fire department?

609
00:30:11,423 --> 00:30:14,085
To build a new church,
to build a new school,

610
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,218
to lift this town
to its feet, Jenny.

611
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:18,728
I believe that destiny
has spoken to us.

612
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:21,789
Did destiny tell you where
the money was coming from?

613
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:24,097
- My inheritance.
- What about the race?

614
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:26,467
The race?
You've heard about that?

615
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:29,166
It's all over town.
The kids told me.

616
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:31,607
Considering the life
my brother's leading,

617
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:33,769
I'll be taking
unfair advantage.

618
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:37,440
You don't think you stand
a chance to win, do you?

619
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:39,848
When you're a missionary
in Philadelphia,

620
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:41,749
you get to be fast on your feet.

621
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,219
How are you in the water?

622
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:46,519
When was the last time
you shot the rapids?

623
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:49,788
And how about the six-up team?
Have you driven one?

624
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:52,728
- I've never driven one.
- Then there's the mountain.

625
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:55,265
Have you ever climbed
straight up 2,000 feet

626
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,200
with razor-sharp rocks
and death at every turn?

627
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,898
Is that what you think
this race is all about?

628
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:01,996
That's it exactly.

629
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:05,236
Half of the people are betting
you won't come out alive.

630
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,402
That's ridiculous.

631
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:10,209
You've been listening to
rumors and a couple of kids.

632
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:12,750
Mayor Ragsdale assures me
it's nothing more

633
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:15,217
than a plain, simple,
ordinary race.

634
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:17,414
You don't believe him,
do you?

635
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:20,014
Of course. He's a fine,
upstanding gentleman.

636
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:21,422
I like that.

637
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:24,018
He's a civic dignitary,
you know.

638
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:26,086
But...

639
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:27,791
Oh.

640
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:31,699
He must not finish
that race,

641
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,238
but you gotta make it
look like an accident.

642
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:36,467
I don't know what
you're head-up about.

643
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:39,533
Ain't no way that city dude
can make that course.

644
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:43,138
Well, there's too much
at stake to take any chances.

645
00:31:43,215 --> 00:31:46,116
There's something about him
that makes me nervous.

646
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:49,915
Do you boys think that
you can handle it this time?

647
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,350
Quit your worrying, Ragsdale.

648
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:55,791
Takin' care of an hombre like
Eli is our meat and potatoes.

649
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,796
Good. I'll have some gravy
for you later.

650
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:05,625
[Sizzling]

651
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:07,797
Dinner in a moment, sir.

652
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:12,036
Try servin' it up here,
you overpaid import!

653
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,270
And close your mouth,

654
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:15,973
less'n you're aimin'
to catch flies.

655
00:32:16,047 --> 00:32:19,710
If I may, sir,
what are you doing up there?

656
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:22,344
I'm spyin' on you,
Mansfield,

657
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,480
to make sure
you delivered the will.

658
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:28,958
Perhaps you were able
to get a glimpse of Master Eli.

659
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:31,791
I would have if'n
you hadn't let me climb up here

660
00:32:31,863 --> 00:32:33,592
without my spyglass.

661
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:35,997
Begging your pardon,
but I wasn't here.

662
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:39,366
That's no excuse,
you lint-headed limey!

663
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:42,838
Now look alive!
I'm comin' down!

664
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:44,568
Very good, sir.

665
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:48,073
Ooh! Ooh!

666
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:51,515
Ooh! Ooh!

667
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:53,278
Are you quite
all right, sir?

668
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:54,784
[Spitting]

669
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:57,185
Now I've had it with you,
Mansfield.

670
00:32:57,255 --> 00:32:58,813
You missed me again,

671
00:32:58,923 --> 00:33:01,687
just like your broken-down neck
did at the gorge.

672
00:33:01,726 --> 00:33:03,489
Accidentally,
I assure you, sir.

673
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:04,550
Bourgeois.

674
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:06,824
If'n you don't kill me
by missin' me,

675
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:09,890
you're gonna get me
with your poison cookin'.

676
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:11,731
Well, the stage
is now set, sir,

677
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:14,670
and we patiently await
the opening curtain.

678
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,934
Don't give me
that highfalutin lingo,

679
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:18,805
you shoddy Shakespeare!

680
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,902
Now, what's my boy look like?

681
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:22,105
As you would say,

682
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,648
‘The spittin' image
of your other son,’ sir.

683
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:26,013
Totin' guns, was he?

684
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:29,349
Yes. Rather a large
rapid-firing one, sir.

685
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:32,015
Another fightin' fool.
Oh, great glory.

686
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,526
I can see a real battle
shapin' up, Mansfield.

687
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:37,254
Under your watchful eye,

688
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:39,991
I'm sure it will be
a marvelous contest.

689
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:41,259
Do sit down, sir.

690
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,664
Oh, thank you kindly.

691
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:44,599
Ah! Ooh!

692
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,328
With you around, Mansfield,

693
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:50,397
my watchful eye may be
the only thing left in my body

694
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:53,137
that ain't broke,
battered, or busted.

695
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:55,043
Revival meeting, ma'am.

696
00:33:55,113 --> 00:33:56,171
A pamphlet, sir?

697
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:59,273
Singin', preachin',
and free soup?

698
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:01,477
- It's homemade.
- Yes.

699
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,386
Free booze, and you might
get yourself a crowd.

700
00:34:04,456 --> 00:34:06,253
But free soup?
[Laughing]

701
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:08,315
Maybe some of the farmers
will come.

702
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:11,089
I sure hope someone does.

703
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:13,630
I hope those gunfighters
don't come.

704
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:15,461
I don't care
what Ragsdale says.

705
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:16,727
If I had my way,

706
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:19,429
that preacher wouldn't make it
to the starting line.

707
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:20,528
They mean Eli.

708
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:22,664
He'd never believe that.

709
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:25,539
He's always looking
at the good side of people.

710
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,976
But while he's looking
at their good side,

711
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:29,980
their bad side's
gonna finish him.

712
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:32,710
What we oughta do
is try to help protect him.

713
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:33,773
Look!

714
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:38,617
Five paces,
we turn and shoot.

715
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,952
Right.

716
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:42,051
What about it?

717
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:44,186
That's a way
to help protect him.

718
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:45,194
How?

719
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:46,958
Just wait.

720
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:48,555
You ready?

721
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:50,692
I'm ready.
You ready?

722
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:52,100
I'm ready.
You ready?

723
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,367
I said I was ready.
You gonna count, count.

724
00:34:56,941 --> 00:34:59,466
All right.
I'm gonna count now.

725
00:35:01,746 --> 00:35:02,940

What are you doing?!

740
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:39,509
Eli needs our help.
They're gonna get him.

741
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:42,576
I don't care. You have
no business playing with guns.

742
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:45,350
- You want me to help unload it?
- Absolutely not.

743
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:47,891
Finish delivering
those pamphlets. Now move.

744
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:51,190
You better be careful, Jenny.
The shotgun's still loaded.

745
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:54,459
Don't you worry about me.
Now, get a move on.

746
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:56,932
- All right.
- Yes'm.

You! You.

753
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:22,386
You almost killed me!

754
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,859
Eli?

755
00:36:23,928 --> 00:36:25,555
Are you crazy?

756
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,655
What are you doing
shooting guns?

757
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:29,859
You don't understand.
Eli, I wasn't...

758
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:31,526
Well, if you wasn't,
who was?

759
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:33,036
The children.

760
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:34,867
Jenny,
don't blame the children.

761
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:37,305
It's bad enough
to twist the truth, Jenny.

762
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:41,573
But to blame two innocent
children for this.

763
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:42,772
I'm shocked.

764
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:44,644

When it comes
to spottin' my son,

767
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:56,220
this has to be
the perfect spot, Mansfield.

768
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:59,093
Innocent children.

769
00:36:59,197 --> 00:37:01,392

770
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:04,694

None of your tricks
this time!

780

On the count of three, draw!

781
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:03,818
Countin' three
is fair by me.

782
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:05,220

- We're gonna be late.
- Jenny, let's go.

791
00:39:32,884 --> 00:39:35,682
What's wrong, Jenny?

792
00:39:35,753 --> 00:39:36,777
Aren't you going?

793
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:38,481
No, I don't think I will.

794
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:41,992
- Eli needs us, Jenny.
- It's his first revival meeting.

795
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:48,891
You'd do anything for him,
wouldn't you?

796
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:51,992
Sure. He's done everything
for us.

797
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,732
Maybe even more than a father
would have done.

798
00:39:56,574 --> 00:39:58,940
You'd like to have a father,
wouldn't you?

799
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,774
More than anything else
in the whole world.

800
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:09,251
Well, maybe I'll bring
some soup down later on.

801
00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:11,886
Come on.

802
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:22,929
No! I tell you,
there is hope!

803
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:24,729
As Solomon
told ancient Israel,

804
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:27,270
the house of the wicked
shall be overthrown,

805
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:30,136
but the tabernacle
of the upright shall flourish.

806
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,609

You nincompoop!

807
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:36,772

Yoooo!

808
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:38,281
Mr. Bloodshy.

809
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:40,840
You better get out
while the gettin's good.

810
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:43,682
The last feller who came here
talkin' tabernacles

811
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:45,086
went out feet first.

812
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:47,056
- You remember that.
- Yeah.

813
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,650
But running away
has never been the solution,

814
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:52,719
not when there are kind,
decent, peaceful people here

815
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:56,426
who want to live in a community
where there's love and goodness.

816
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:59,664
Looks like his brother
and talks like his mother.

817
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:02,569
That poor milksop
stands as much chance out here

818
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:05,474
as a snowflake
in the Sahara.

819
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:07,977
What about my father?
Rest his soul.

820
00:41:08,045 --> 00:41:09,910
He practically
built this town.

821
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:11,380
Practically?!

822
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:15,351
I cleared timber,
drove nails, dug ditches!

823
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:18,946
What am I telling you for?
You English sissy!

824
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:22,015
But then he just sat around,
let it all turn sour,

825
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:23,924
let it fall
into the wrong hands.

826
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:26,429
Now it's a town of gamblin',
gunfightin',

827
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:28,158
hard drinkin',
and fast women.

828
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:30,291
Sounds pretty good to me.

[Chuckling]

830
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:33,960
But if a town changed
for the worse,

831
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:35,938
it could change for the better.

832
00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:39,238
All it needs is faith,
courage, and conviction.

833
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,005
I'm ready to stay right here

834
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:43,945
and help you fight
to get this town back again.

835
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:47,473
Well, I guess he does have
a smidgen of spunk after all,

836
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:49,315
for a prune picker.

837
00:41:49,387 --> 00:41:50,911
- Mr. Bloodshy!
- Yeah? Ooh.

838
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:52,888
I'm afraid
you won't be here long.

839
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:55,289
You ain't gonna finish
that race.

840
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,291
You know why?

841
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,988
Because there isn't
going to be any silly race.

842
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:01,428
What's he mean, no race?

843
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:05,231
If’n he cancels my race,
I'll cancel him!

844
00:42:05,303 --> 00:42:08,431
I'm going across the street now
and talk to my brother.

845
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:11,100
We'll split this inheritance
and use the money

846
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:14,474
to make this a town
worth living in.

847
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:16,479
Behind those guns of his,

848
00:42:16,547 --> 00:42:18,742
there's a fine,
decent human being.

850
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:23,587
Mr. Bloodshy, do you really
believe all that?

851
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:25,679
I certainly do.
Yes.

852
00:42:25,756 --> 00:42:28,350
Well, you're as crazy
as a coot.

Marcus will spread the word.

855
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:37,962

with love and kindness

and join our hands together

874
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:49,439
for the benefit
of the community?

875
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:50,735
You know what I mean?

876
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:53,402
Yeah.
You're a-feared to race me.

877
00:43:53,477 --> 00:43:55,911
Certainly not,
but I think it's silly

878
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,505
for two grown men
to compete with each other.

879
00:43:58,616 --> 00:44:01,517
Now, if'n you don't run
in that race tomorrow,

880
00:44:01,552 --> 00:44:04,419
you're nothin' more
than I thought you was.

881
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:08,015
A yellow-bellied, lily-livered
coward from the city.

882
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:10,117
Now you get outta here

883
00:44:10,194 --> 00:44:13,652
afore I'm obliged
to blow your brains out.

884
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:15,164
[Singing continues]

885
00:44:15,232 --> 00:44:17,632
But we still don't
have this settled.

886
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:21,160
And I'm not leaving here
until we do.

887
00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:23,536
Oh, you're not, huh?

888
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:24,801
[Voice croaks] No.

889
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,775
[Laughter]

890
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:33,007
You ought to be more careful
with that gun.

891
00:44:34,018 --> 00:44:34,950
[Laughter]

892
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:37,715
Say good night
to Brother Eli.

893
00:44:37,788 --> 00:44:40,120
ALL:
Good night, Brother Eli!

894
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:42,455

[Singing continues]

896
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:54,328
Oh, Eli.

897

[Laughter]

898
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:03,471
We'll see you at the race
tomorrow, Brother Eli.

899
00:45:04,148 --> 00:45:07,049
That is, if you can get
your creakin' carcass

900
00:45:07,118 --> 00:45:08,676
to the startin' line.

901
00:45:08,753 --> 00:45:09,742
Whoo-hoo!

902
00:45:12,156 --> 00:45:15,421
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't get away with that!

903
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:16,425
Marcus, stop.

904
00:45:16,494 --> 00:45:18,485
BILLY:
Now you won't have to wash.

905
00:45:18,562 --> 00:45:19,995
[Laughter]

906
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:25,535
When are you gonna realize
they don't want us here?

907
00:45:25,603 --> 00:45:27,537
But we are needed.

908
00:45:27,605 --> 00:45:29,334
Eli, they're against you.

909
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:30,738
All of 'em are.

910
00:45:30,808 --> 00:45:31,832
Just a minute.

911
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:34,537
You haven't lost faith,
have you?

912
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:37,342
- Of course not.
- Not in you.

913
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:57,925
Five mighty tests of courage,
skill, and strength.

914
00:45:58,002 --> 00:45:59,833
Startin' with
the iron donkeys,

915
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:02,998
snortin' little piston-drivin'
steam engines,

916
00:46:03,074 --> 00:46:05,975
and endin' up
with the six-up teams.

917
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:09,035
Wagons pulled
by six powerful horses.

918
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:13,447
You're gonna see fierce,
spirited, untamed, wild-eyed...

919
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:14,916
You lookin' for me?

920
00:46:15,653 --> 00:46:17,814
I'll tend to you later.

921
00:46:17,888 --> 00:46:20,482
[Chuckling]

922
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:25,952
Anyway, folks,
the finish line is in town.

923
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,657
And one more thing.

924
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:30,825
Oh, yeah, I get it. Right.
Be brief.

925
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:33,392
Well, to be brief, folks,

926
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,439
stationed at each
and every point,

927
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:36,905
there will be an official

928
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:39,841
selected by our impartial
race committee

929
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,811
to see that there's
no hanky-pankying going on.

930
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,347
Morning, Oscar.

931
00:46:44,415 --> 00:46:45,575
Snead.

932
00:46:45,649 --> 00:46:49,312
Hey, $5 says the preacher
don't make it to the canoes.

933
00:46:49,386 --> 00:46:51,445
Officials ain't allowed
to make bets.

934
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:52,750
So?

935
00:46:53,557 --> 00:46:54,615
You givin' odds?

936
00:46:54,692 --> 00:46:57,024
You name 'em, you got 'em.

937
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:03,824
Cat's cradles.

938
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:05,664
It better be.

939
00:47:05,736 --> 00:47:07,465
[Groans]

940
00:47:07,538 --> 00:47:09,733
Now, push, Mansfield.

941
00:47:09,807 --> 00:47:12,173
Push. Push.

942
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:14,370
[Grunting]

943
00:47:18,682 --> 00:47:22,049
Ooh, I knew it
in my bones, Mansfield.

944
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:24,053
Fair race, my foot.

945
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:27,557
My boy Eli's gonna need help,
and lots of it.

946
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:28,990
So I best get my tools.

947
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:30,219
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

[Groaning]

949
00:47:35,065 --> 00:47:39,297

[Groaning]

951
00:47:41,038 --> 00:47:42,198
Uh-oh.

952
00:47:42,273 --> 00:47:43,968
- Ooh!
- I'm sorry.

953
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,668
There's one thing for sure.

954
00:47:45,743 --> 00:47:49,611
Master Eli certainly
has a chance with you around.

955
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,978
Sir?

956
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:53,175
Sir?

957
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,742
Oh, sir!

958
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:01,414
Oh, and something else
I forgot.

959
00:48:01,492 --> 00:48:03,858
Before we start the race...

960
00:48:03,928 --> 00:48:05,225
[Laughter]

961
00:48:05,296 --> 00:48:08,197
On second thought,
let's just start the race.

962
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:10,529
Bring up the iron donkeys.

963
00:48:21,478 --> 00:48:23,275
What do you think that means?

964
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:24,905
I don't know.

965
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:37,460
Eli, we got somethin'
for you.

966
00:48:37,528 --> 00:48:38,495
For me?

967
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:40,359
Be careful.
Don't squash it.

968
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:41,762
It's for good luck.

969
00:48:41,832 --> 00:48:43,390
In case you need any.

970
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:52,702

Eli, we know you can win.

973

975
00:49:03,921 --> 00:49:06,389
Do you mind just having
a little faith?

976
00:49:06,457 --> 00:49:10,257
Contestants,
mount your engines!

977
00:49:24,642 --> 00:49:27,338

We both got somethin'
to look forward to.

981
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:36,652

00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,375
Hey, Bloodshy!

1055
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:47,610
Quitters don't run
in our family!

1056
00:56:47,684 --> 00:56:49,652
Yee-aah!

1057
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:54,348
Yah!

1058
00:57:25,055 --> 00:57:26,920
Aaah! Aah!

00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:29,185
[Grunting]

1060
00:57:46,543 --> 00:57:48,602
Wrong way.
Wrong way!

[Panting]

1062
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:10,826
Oh, no.

1063
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:13,768
Oh, no.
Aah! Aah!

1064
00:58:13,837 --> 00:58:16,067
Ohhhh!

1065
00:58:35,492 --> 00:58:36,823
Help!

Aaah!

1070
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:02,543
Looks pretty good for you,
Billy.

1071
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:04,951
Yeah,
and pretty bad for him.

1072
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,280
Hey, look!

1073
00:59:09,392 --> 00:59:12,384
Am I seein'
what I think I'm seein'?

1074
00:59:12,963 --> 00:59:15,397
I coulda told him
this race would get him

1075
00:59:15,465 --> 00:59:17,695
one way or tother.

1076
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,301
[Spits, panting]

1077
00:59:27,811 --> 00:59:30,575
Well, looks like
you might get your chance.

1078
00:59:30,647 --> 00:59:34,014
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

1079
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:37,884
You better get a wiggle on it.
That fella's still a-kickin'.

1080
00:59:37,954 --> 00:59:40,514
Come on, Bucky,
let's help him out.

1081

MANSFIELD:
Has he succeeded, sir?

1082
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:44,785
JASPER: Has he?

1083
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:47,261
I told you that half-drowneded
church mouse

1084
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,264
is sure givin' him
a run for it,

1085
00:59:49,332 --> 00:59:51,266
in spite of them
sabotagin' Sneads.

1086
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:53,632
I daresay the Sneads
aren't bright enough

1087
00:59:53,703 --> 00:59:56,228
to be doing this dastardly deed
on their own.

1088
00:59:56,306 --> 00:59:59,434
I'll do the daresayin'
'round here, Mansfield.

1089
00:59:59,509 --> 01:00:01,272
Oh, very good, sir.

1090
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:04,279
Yeah, I daresay the Sneads
don't seem bright enough

1091
01:00:04,347 --> 01:00:05,439
to be doing this...

1092
01:00:05,515 --> 01:00:06,607
Dastardly.

1093
01:00:06,683 --> 01:00:08,776
...deed by themselves,
Mansfield.

1094
01:00:08,852 --> 01:00:11,184
- Excellent observation, sir.
- Yeah.

1095
01:00:11,254 --> 01:00:12,949
Yeah, we best get into town.

1096
01:00:13,023 --> 01:00:16,288
I got a hunch who the real
schemin' skunk is.

1097
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:17,917
Hop aboard.

1098
01:00:20,363 --> 01:00:21,455
Where am I going now?

1099
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:24,590
Up the mountain, just as soon
as you refresh yourself

1100
01:00:24,668 --> 01:00:25,794
with a little water.

1101
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:26,961
Water?

1102
01:00:27,037 --> 01:00:29,631
I'm a walking sponge
right now.

1103
01:00:29,706 --> 01:00:31,469
And a cold one.

1104
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:34,169
Don't matter.
One of the rules.

1105
01:00:34,244 --> 01:00:36,712
It's for the well-being
of both contestants.

1106
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,749
You saw Wild Billy
take his, didn't you?

1107
01:00:42,052 --> 01:00:44,543
Well, if Billy...

1108
01:00:47,891 --> 01:00:49,518
Mountain water.

1109
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:52,220
[Shivers] I've never...

1110
01:00:52,295 --> 01:00:55,560
I've never tasted water
like this before.

1111
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,092
That's the funniest stuff
I've ever had.

1112
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:03,597
Mmm, mmm.
[Gulps]

1113
01:01:03,673 --> 01:01:06,107
You know, it's...

1114
01:01:06,176 --> 01:01:07,939
It's not bad.

1115
01:01:10,046 --> 01:01:14,779
It certainly
got rid of those shivers.

1116
01:01:14,851 --> 01:01:16,182
[Shivers]

1117
01:01:17,354 --> 01:01:20,619
[Slurring] You know...
I kinda like it.

1118
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:21,850
[Sniffs]

1119
01:01:21,925 --> 01:01:24,519
A man ought to drink water
more often.

1120
01:01:24,594 --> 01:01:27,825
I liked visitin' with you,
but you better catch Billy.

1121
01:01:27,897 --> 01:01:31,560
You gentlemen mind if I take
this little old water jug?

1122
01:01:31,634 --> 01:01:33,465
Why, I think
that'd be all right.

1123
01:01:33,536 --> 01:01:35,265
- Sure.
- Good.

1124
01:01:36,072 --> 01:01:39,132
Hey, mister!
That's not the mountain.

1125
01:01:39,209 --> 01:01:41,268
That's the river.

1126
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:43,107
Oh, that's right, yes.

1127
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:44,976
The mountain
and the river.

1128
01:01:45,048 --> 01:01:46,640
The mountain.

1129
01:01:46,716 --> 01:01:49,276
I'll start right on up.
Yeah.

1130
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:01,588

1132
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:05,597
‘But right behind
Wild Billy.’

[All booing]

1134
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:20,181
You think Eli can win?

1135
01:02:20,683 --> 01:02:22,241
Against a stacked deck?

1136
01:02:26,022 --> 01:02:28,354
We better find out
what they're up to.

1137
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,727
RAGSDALE: If you don't get
that preacher on the mountain,

1138
01:02:39,803 --> 01:02:41,964
make sure you get him
at Devil's Gorge.

1139
01:02:42,038 --> 01:02:43,505
I told you, quit worryin'.

1140
01:02:43,573 --> 01:02:46,406
Ain't no possible way
he can get by the gorge.

1141
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:47,500
That's good.

1142
01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:50,307
All right, here's the gravy
that I promised you.

1143
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,814
After you get rid
of that psalm singer...

1144
01:02:52,882 --> 01:02:55,043
Pay attention!

1145
01:02:55,118 --> 01:02:57,416
We're plannin'
a little dynamite party

1146
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:59,648
for Wild Billy
at Deadman's Pass.

1147
01:02:59,756 --> 01:03:01,724
- Wild Billy?
- Yep.

1148
01:03:01,758 --> 01:03:04,750
You want to get rid
of Wild Billy, too?

1149
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:06,728
I don't know.

1150
01:03:06,796 --> 01:03:09,060
You see,
I've doctored that will.

1151
01:03:09,132 --> 01:03:12,260
You see, if nobody wins,
then the money and the saloon,

1152
01:03:12,335 --> 01:03:16,237
the town goes to the executor
of that will, and that's me.

1153
01:03:16,306 --> 01:03:18,934
Now, you and your brothers,
being my partners,

1154
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:22,444
why, you'll get, uh, uh...

1155

half.

1156
01:03:25,682 --> 01:03:28,276
Well, now do you want
to bump off Wild Billy?

[Laughs evilly]
Does a coyote like to howl?

1158

come down the trail.

1159
01:03:34,557 --> 01:03:35,489
Right there.

1160
01:03:35,558 --> 01:03:37,958
That's where you put
the dynamite, there.

1161
01:03:38,027 --> 01:03:38,959
Got it.

1162
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:40,120
Okay.

1163
01:03:40,196 --> 01:03:42,164
This is gonna be a cinch.

1164
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:43,665
All right, now let's go.

1165
01:03:46,536 --> 01:03:47,560
Come on.

1170

But, sir, there must be
another way of handling this.

1171

Would you take
your hands off... ow!

They're gonna get
Brother Eli!

Good goin', Billy.
You made it.

Well, what did you expect?

you'd be first...

01:18:47,636 --> 01:18:49,604
I got him, Eli!
I got him!

1409
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:50,933
You?
It was Jenny.

1410
01:18:51,006 --> 01:18:53,600
I don't think it was me.
I think it was the...

1411
01:18:53,675 --> 01:18:54,835
Oh, no!

1412
01:19:06,688 --> 01:19:08,952
Uh, I don't know
what that was, folks.

1413
01:19:09,024 --> 01:19:11,424
It could have been thunder.

1414
01:19:11,493 --> 01:19:13,154
But one thing I do know.

1415
01:19:13,228 --> 01:19:16,356
A winner could be coming in
any minute now.

1416
01:19:23,705 --> 01:19:25,002
Oh, Eli.

1417
01:19:25,074 --> 01:19:26,701
I've got to find out.

1418
01:19:52,868 --> 01:19:54,426
Billy!

1419
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:56,061
Billy!

1420
01:20:03,846 --> 01:20:06,041
Billy!

1421
01:20:06,115 --> 01:20:07,776
Billy!

1422
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:09,613
Billy!

1423
01:20:10,652 --> 01:20:14,213
Are you just gonna stand there
caterwaulin' all day?

1424
01:20:15,724 --> 01:20:17,487
Thank heaven you're safe.

1425
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:21,987
I might have knowed it.
Never trust a Bible-banger.

1426
01:20:22,064 --> 01:20:24,430
[Sniffs]
You went and ruined everything.

1427
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,432
What?

1428
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:28,868
The will says,
‘May the best man win.’

1429
01:20:28,937 --> 01:20:32,771
Now I ain't so sure
I am the best man.

1430
01:20:32,841 --> 01:20:34,706
You saved my life!

1431
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:38,507
Now, how am I gonna whip a man
who saves my life?

1432
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:41,310
Billy, Ragsdale set us
both up to be killed,

1433
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:44,250
and he's going to get
all the money if nobody wins.

1434
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:46,446
Ragsdale?

1435
01:20:46,522 --> 01:20:49,355
That snivelin' sneak!

1436
01:20:49,424 --> 01:20:51,358
Then one of us has gotta win.

1437
01:20:51,426 --> 01:20:53,553
[Cheers and applause]

1438
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:57,525
Thank you, Sheriff.
Thank you, thank you, boys.

1439
01:20:57,599 --> 01:21:00,966
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
all my loyal constituents.

1440
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:05,062
Now, then,
as executor of the estate

1441
01:21:05,107 --> 01:21:10,044
of the late, great,
beloved Jasper Bloodshy...

1442
01:21:10,112 --> 01:21:11,374
[Crowd muttering]

1443
01:21:11,446 --> 01:21:15,473
I was fully prepared
to turn over his entire,

1444
01:21:15,551 --> 01:21:19,612
every last cent
of that fortune

1445
01:21:19,688 --> 01:21:22,589
to whichever brother wins,
whichever one comes in.

1446
01:21:22,658 --> 01:21:24,216
[Crowd cheering]

1447
01:21:24,293 --> 01:21:26,056
But, uh...

1448
01:21:26,128 --> 01:21:29,154
Well, it seems to me
that if there is to be a winner,

1449
01:21:29,231 --> 01:21:33,065
he should have been here
a long time ago, hmm?

1450
01:21:33,135 --> 01:21:35,729
Matter of fact,
it has occurred to me,

1451
01:21:35,804 --> 01:21:41,333
as I am sure it has occurred
to each and every one of you,

1452
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:44,777
that some unforeseen,
dire tragedy

1453
01:21:44,846 --> 01:21:48,748
has befallen those two
fine young men, huh?

1454
01:21:48,817 --> 01:21:50,250
[Crowd murmuring]

1455
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:51,479
Let's take him, too.

1456
01:21:51,553 --> 01:21:52,850
No, no, come on.

1457
01:21:52,921 --> 01:21:54,115
However!

1458
01:21:54,189 --> 01:21:58,148
However, there is a, uh,
provision in the will

1459
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:02,060
which states
that if there is no winner,

1460
01:22:02,097 --> 01:22:04,793
then the entire fortune
goes to...

1461
01:22:04,866 --> 01:22:06,527
Rider comin'!

1462
01:22:06,602 --> 01:22:08,399
A rider comin'.

1463
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:10,028
Rider comin'?

1464
01:22:10,105 --> 01:22:12,869
Who is it?
Can you see?

1465
01:22:15,611 --> 01:22:16,771
I don't believe it!

1466
01:22:25,053 --> 01:22:27,044
Are you sure
that's the preacher?

1467
01:22:30,626 --> 01:22:32,025
[Laughs excitedly]

1468
01:22:32,094 --> 01:22:34,756
It's Eli!
He's won!

1469
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:38,693
[Cheering]

1470
01:22:38,767 --> 01:22:40,758
Whoa!

1471
01:22:40,836 --> 01:22:42,736
You're safe!
How's Billy?

1472
01:22:42,804 --> 01:22:44,738
Eli, we knew
you could do it!

1473
01:22:44,806 --> 01:22:46,569
Where's Ragsdale?!

1474
01:22:46,642 --> 01:22:47,939
ROXANNE:
There he goes!

1475
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:50,274
MARCUS: With as much money
as he can get away with.

1476
01:22:50,345 --> 01:22:51,835
Hold it, Ragsdale!

1477
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:53,847
Hyah, hyah!
Go on! Get out of here!

1478
01:22:53,915 --> 01:22:56,679
Move it! Hyah!
Get out of here!

1479
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:02,083
Hey, Eli, you're shootin'
just like Wild Billy.

1480
01:23:02,157 --> 01:23:05,058
Come back here,
you consarn, yellow-bellied,

1481
01:23:05,127 --> 01:23:07,823
lily-livered,
two-timin' polecat!

1482
01:23:07,896 --> 01:23:09,193
Yah!

1483
01:23:09,264 --> 01:23:12,233
Eli isn't Eli.
Eli's Wild Billy.

1484
01:23:12,301 --> 01:23:14,201
Another rider comin'!

1485
01:23:14,269 --> 01:23:16,703
- Which one's this?
- Is it Eli or Billy?

1486
01:23:16,772 --> 01:23:20,003
Now, there's Eli.
I think.

1487
01:23:20,075 --> 01:23:23,101
Brother,
I'd like a word with you.

1488
01:23:28,283 --> 01:23:31,218
I said, ‘Brother,
I'd like a word with you.’

1489
01:23:31,286 --> 01:23:32,947
Later!
Swing me up!

1490
01:23:34,823 --> 01:23:35,881
Aah!

1491
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:40,828
[Laughter]

1492
01:23:53,241 --> 01:23:55,766
I'm ready, Rattlesnake.

1493
01:23:55,844 --> 01:23:57,971
Let's make it clean and fast.

1494
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,914
All right.
We'll count to three.

1495
01:24:04,519 --> 01:24:06,350
I'm gonna get you, Ragsdale!

1496
01:24:11,827 --> 01:24:13,727
Marcus, what are you doing?

1497
01:24:13,795 --> 01:24:14,853
Oh, no!

1498
01:24:16,465 --> 01:24:19,195
Hey, what is this?
Get that off!

1499
01:24:19,768 --> 01:24:22,430
I don't see any way
you can trick me this time.

1500
01:24:22,504 --> 01:24:24,768
[Chuckling]

1501
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,066
1.

1502
01:24:31,012 --> 01:24:32,343
2.

1503
01:24:32,414 --> 01:24:35,440
Get off me!
What is this thing? Get away!

1504
01:24:36,017 --> 01:24:36,779
3.

1505
01:24:36,852 --> 01:24:39,343
Get off!
Get off!

1506
01:24:39,421 --> 01:24:41,184
- Aah!
- Ooh!

1507
01:24:41,256 --> 01:24:42,587
Aah! Aah!

1508
01:24:42,657 --> 01:24:44,090
Hold on!

1509
01:24:47,329 --> 01:24:48,591
Come on, get him!

1510
01:24:48,663 --> 01:24:50,221
Get him, Eli!
He's a crook!

1511
01:24:50,298 --> 01:24:51,788
He's got all the money!

1512
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:54,898
Look out!

1513
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,607
Tarnation!

1514
01:25:04,379 --> 01:25:06,074
Marcus, are you all right?

1515
01:25:06,148 --> 01:25:07,706
That was great!

1516
01:25:07,783 --> 01:25:08,772
What?

1517
01:25:11,953 --> 01:25:13,750
Here he comes, Mansfield!

1518
01:25:13,822 --> 01:25:17,087
The dirty fly
into the spider's web.

1519
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:26,494
Stand back, Mansfield,
and see how the West was won.

1520
01:25:27,135 --> 01:25:28,261
Ehhh! Ooh!

1521
01:25:28,336 --> 01:25:29,894
MANSFIELD: Oh, sir!

1522
01:25:29,971 --> 01:25:31,939
Great jumpin' Jasper's ghost!

1523
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:32,939
Aaah!

1524
01:25:33,008 --> 01:25:33,997
Ohh!

1525
01:25:34,075 --> 01:25:36,236
Aah! It's a ghost!
It's a ghost!

1526
01:25:39,147 --> 01:25:42,014
I can't be seein' this.
I know I'm not seein' this.

1527
01:25:42,083 --> 01:25:44,950
- But get off me!
- Nothing doin', Ragsdale!

1528
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,454
I'm takin' you with me!

1529
01:25:47,522 --> 01:25:50,821
I take everything back!
I'll give you the money back!

1530
01:25:50,892 --> 01:25:52,655
Too late, you whinin' weasel!

1531
01:25:52,727 --> 01:25:54,285
I'll see you in jail

1532
01:25:54,362 --> 01:25:58,765
if it's the last thing
I ever do-o-o!

1533
01:26:01,069 --> 01:26:04,095
It was the old man,
I tell you! I saw him!

1534
01:26:04,172 --> 01:26:07,005
I tell you, it was
the strangest thing I ever saw.

1535
01:26:07,075 --> 01:26:09,236
He came floatin' down
in a white sheet.

1536
01:26:09,311 --> 01:26:12,109
The bats have taken over
the belfry.

1537
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:14,705
You gotta believe me!
Hey, Sheriff!

1538
01:26:14,783 --> 01:26:17,217
Listen, you start that story
one more time,

1539
01:26:17,285 --> 01:26:20,379
there'll be two ghosts,
and you'll be one!

1540
01:26:20,455 --> 01:26:22,150
I'll be late
for that ceremony.

1541
01:26:22,224 --> 01:26:24,385
Deputy, keep an eye
on the prisoners.

1542
01:26:24,459 --> 01:26:26,689
Right, chief.

1543
01:26:26,761 --> 01:26:29,855
Deputy?
You gotta believe me, man!

1544
01:26:29,931 --> 01:26:32,092
[Cheers and applause]

1545
01:26:32,167 --> 01:26:34,397
And so my brother and I
have decided

1546
01:26:34,469 --> 01:26:39,202
to share the money
and use it to make a new town.

1547
01:26:39,274 --> 01:26:40,798
A town
a whole lot different

1548
01:26:40,876 --> 01:26:44,107
than the one
you've been used to.

1549
01:26:44,179 --> 01:26:47,171
And if anybody has
any other ideas,

1550
01:26:47,249 --> 01:26:49,183
they're gonna have to
answer to m...

1551
01:26:49,251 --> 01:26:51,082
[Clears throat]

1552
01:26:51,152 --> 01:26:53,017
My brother, Eli.

1553
01:26:53,088 --> 01:26:54,578
[Laughter]

1554
01:26:54,656 --> 01:26:57,750
It's going to be a town
I hope you'll all be proud of.

1555
01:26:57,859 --> 01:27:00,453
I know I'm going to be proud
of the new church

1556
01:27:00,495 --> 01:27:02,554
and the new school
we're building.

1557
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:07,728
A new school for our children,
yours and mine.

1558
01:27:07,802 --> 01:27:10,498
He means us.
We've got a father.

1559
01:27:10,572 --> 01:27:12,403
And I'll tell you
something else.

1560
01:27:12,474 --> 01:27:15,602
Not only will these children
have the best teacher,

1561
01:27:15,677 --> 01:27:18,441
they'll have the prettiest one
they've ever seen.

1562
01:27:18,513 --> 01:27:20,674
[Laughter and applause]

1563
01:27:20,749 --> 01:27:24,276
Of course, I may be
a little prejudiced.

1564
01:27:24,853 --> 01:27:27,344
I think we're gettin'
a mother, too.

1565
01:27:27,422 --> 01:27:28,787
[Cheering]

1566
01:27:30,492 --> 01:27:32,619
You know,
I can't rightly recollect

1567
01:27:32,694 --> 01:27:34,855
ever seein'
the whole town together

1568
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:38,525
with folks a-smilin' at each
other instead of shootin'.

1569
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,500
[Crowd murmuring
in agreement]

1570
01:27:40,569 --> 01:27:43,436
I think this is a fitting moment
now to pay tribute

1571
01:27:43,505 --> 01:27:45,996
to the one man
who made all this possible.

1572
01:27:46,074 --> 01:27:49,202
Our father, Jasper Bloodshy.

1573
01:27:51,379 --> 01:27:53,472
It's too bad
he couldn't have lived

1574
01:27:53,548 --> 01:27:55,812
to see his last wish come true.

1575
01:27:55,884 --> 01:27:57,010
Amen, brother.

1576
01:27:57,085 --> 01:27:59,144
But if you'll all join in
with me now

1577
01:27:59,254 --> 01:28:01,745
singing ‘Something Good
is Bound to Happen,’

1578
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:03,690
I guarantee
no matter where he is,

1579

1591

Well, sir,
then you might reconsider

1592
01:28:29,084 --> 01:28:30,381
and make an appearance.

1593
01:28:30,452 --> 01:28:33,910
And send the whole town off

01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:37,186
No, I finished what
I set out to do, Mansfield.

01:28:40,395 --> 01:28:43,421
Yeah, to a place I ain't seen
for years, Mansfield.

Now I've straightened out
my sons, Wild Billy and Eli,

I gotta go see

Calico Kate and Wildcat Winnie,
are doin'.

1603

Let's go, Mansfield!

01:28:58,213 --> 01:29:00,181
Very good, sir.
