In the steam room.

183
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:29,920
(Lowered voice) His office sometimes.

184
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:31,755
So you were supposed to
meet at the gym this morning,

185
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:33,323
but Jason never showed up.

186
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:37,560
And that bastard never even
bothered to answer your calls.

187
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:39,662
(Lowered voice) That
must've felt real bad, huh?

188
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:42,331
You gave him eight months of your life.

189
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,834
He promised you everything,
and then he left you cold.

190
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:47,270
So you... 

191
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:48,971
shot his wife.

192
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,806
If you couldn't have him, no one could.

193
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:53,741
Is that right?

194
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:56,478
Yes.

195
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:01,383
Ms. Alvarez,

196
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:03,685
can you remember if Jason
was right or left-handed?

197
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:09,890
Right.

198
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:14,462
(Man) Any idea of a motive?

199
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:17,697
(Reporter shouting at same
time, camera shutters clicking)

200
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:20,967
(Man shouts indistinctly)

201
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:24,170
(Shouting continues)

202
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:29,476
S.A.P.D. has arrested Martina
Alvarez in the shooting of

203
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:32,377
Assistant District
Attorney Heather Endelsohn.

204
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:36,215
Cause of death is a gunshot
to the middle of the chest.

205
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:38,584
So this is wrapped up?

206
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:40,319
(Mouth full) Salazar sure thinks so.

207
00:09:40,386 --> 00:09:43,054
There's nothing that man
likes more than a podium.

208
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:44,823
He is one hell of an investigator.

209
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,658
Alvarez wasn't sleeping with the groom.

210
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:48,126
She's lying.

211
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:50,328
Well, then she just lied her
way into the death penalty.

212
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,330
Her nails were chipped.

213
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:54,031
Is that supposed to break my heart?

214
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:55,433
You don't shoot the wife of your soul mate

215
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,335
without looking like the
one he should've picked.

216
00:09:57,402 --> 00:10:00,238
Salazar has a confession,
and you have chipped nails.

217
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:02,406
Jason Bluford was left-handed.

218
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:05,275
Shooter guessed right-handed.

219
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:06,709
Do I need to tell you
why a woman would know

220
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:08,911
which hand her lover favors?

221
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:11,881
(Salazar speaks indistinctly)

222
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:15,218
I saw fear in her eyes, lieutenant.

223
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:16,486
There's more to this case.

224
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:18,921
Don't burn bridges with S.A.P.D., Molly.

225
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:20,456
They're fully capable of conduct... 

226
00:10:20,524 --> 00:10:22,991
I didn't say they weren't capable.

227
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:25,294
Yes, the groom knew the
shooter. Yes, that is correct.

228
00:10:25,362 --> 00:10:26,495
I just said they're wrong.

229

Come again?

Mom says that's why you
moved back here last June.

You're 9. That's none of your business.

Y'all, this is not my fight.

265
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:05,903
Those girls of yours are way too grown up.

266
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:07,739
I did not wear lip gloss at 14.

was the reason for the meeting?

334

335
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,613

336
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:00,314
15 in 3 counties.

337
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:01,983
But?

338
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:04,318
I'm going back for Alvarez.

339
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,988
Rangers support other agencies
when they lack resources.

340
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:09,256
That's not the case with S.A.P.D.

341
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:10,490
Are you telling me to drop this?

342
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,727
(Sighs) No. I agree with you.

343
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:16,763
- It's odd D.E.A. was dealing with a state prosecutor.
- Mm-hmm.

344
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,498
Find out why.

345
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:20,167
But keep S.A.P.D. in the loop.

346
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:22,735
Yes, sir.

347
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,886
I forgot cream,

348
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:33,424
but I also brought you
some toothpaste and lotion.

349
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:36,960
And there's some... chapstick.

350
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,200

351
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:45,002
I have nothing else to say to you.

352
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,005
S.A.P.D. has charged you
with premeditated murder.

353
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:52,142
And they have plenty of
evidence to support their case.

354
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,015
My training and my instinct

355
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:01,751
tell me that you weren't having
an affair with Justin Bluford.

356
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:05,254
And I'm hoping that you

357
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:06,955
to tell me why you're lying,

358
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:09,224
and the why of it all

359
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:11,693
that might just keep you off death row.

360
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:18,567
I knew what I was doing
when I pulled the trigger.

361
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:21,101
If you were angry and wanted revenge,

362
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,137
why didn't you just shoot him?

363
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:27,642
Because he hurts more alive.

364
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:40,820
It's Jason.

365
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:44,257
You said "Justin" earlier
to see if I would notice.

366
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:45,958

Uh-huh. So that's what last
night was about after all?

419
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,051
(Singsongy) Same as you.

420
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:51,220
No. No, I can separate my ambitions.

(Sighs) Mm.

422
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:54,490
(Grunts) Mm-hmm.

423
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,460
I don't think Martina
Alvarez shot an a.D.A.

424
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,395
- Because she was sleeping with the groom.
- No?

425
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:01,763
And the fact that you were
meeting with the D.A.'s office

426
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,232
tells me that your agency
has an interest in this.

427
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,469
So... tell me what it is.

428
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:12,274
It's not your jurisdiction.

429
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:18,045
It's a case that I've been
building for two years.

430
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:21,382
And I am not gonna cross
contaminate it with the Rangers.

431
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,151
Alvarez didn't shoot an
A.D.A. because she was jealous.

432
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:27,188
My bet? The cartel was involved.

433
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:30,057
So why don't you tell me how
so we can help each other?

434
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,992
Right. So that we can help each other.

435
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,793
Wait. What do I get out of this again?

436
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,195
Federal witness.

437
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:37,430
Really? 'Cause from where I stand,

438
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:40,733
the S.A.P.D. has charged a woman with
premeditated murder... (Zips up dress)

439
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:42,235
And that doesn't relate to the D.E.A.

440
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:44,504
You know it's related.

441
00:20:44,572 --> 00:20:47,840
Well, then why don't you
get me something to prove it?

442
00:20:49,342 --> 00:20:51,410
Shutting me out is a big mistake,

443
00:20:51,478 --> 00:20:53,778
and I'll prove it.

444
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:57,249
- I think Alvarez is working for the cartel.
- No.

445
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:59,284
They hire hit men, not little girls.

446
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:01,587
Yeah, maybe not this time.

447
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:03,021
Maybe they chose Alvarez

448
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:06,224
specifically because of
her proximity to the groom.

449
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,026
And then they could sell
this as a crime of passion.

450
00:21:09,094 --> 00:21:11,829
- Well, then why does Alvarez go along with it?
- I don't know.

451
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,932
But whatever it is, it terrifies her.

452
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,934
More than the death penalty?

453
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:18,102
I don't know why she's so afraid,

454
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,005
but she served her purpose.

455
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,672
S.A.P.D. missed something.

456
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,640
I'm gonna go back to Alvarez's house.

457

513
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,687
I married a man

514
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:45,823
that I thought loved me,

515
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:47,092
deeply.

516
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,129
I was young.

517
00:25:51,197 --> 00:25:52,730
He was... 

518
00:25:57,302 --> 00:25:59,703
(Whispering) he was strong,

519
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,039
and I felt protected,

520
00:26:03,108 --> 00:26:05,242
until one day... (Inhales sharply)

521
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:11,781
he hit me.

522
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:14,317
And then he hit me again

523
00:26:14,384 --> 00:26:15,751
and again.

524
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:24,994
I've never told anyone the truth,

525
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:28,563
and maybe I never will,

526
00:26:28,631 --> 00:26:32,267
because I'm ashamed.

527
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:35,069
I'm ashamed that I didn't have the strength

528
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:38,072
to leave sooner.

529
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:41,676
But I couldn't.

530
00:26:41,744 --> 00:26:43,911
I felt trapped.

531
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:47,181
But, Martina, I was wrong.

532
00:26:50,252 --> 00:26:53,220
(Photos rustle)

533
00:26:53,288 --> 00:26:56,423
Now I'm not here as your friend.

534
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,125
I'm here because you face the death penalty

535
00:26:58,193 --> 00:27:00,460
for a crime you were coerced into doing.

536
00:27:00,528 --> 00:27:05,931
<i>Tell me what happened right
now, and I will find your family.</i>

537
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,569
(Voice breaks) How do you
know they're still alive?

538
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:12,172
I don't.

539
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,907
But if they are,

540
00:27:14,975 --> 00:27:18,177
<i>I will find them and
get them out of Mexico.</i>

541
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:22,581
<i>But you have to tell me
everything that you know now.</i>

542
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:29,154
<i>(Heartbeat thumping)</i>

543
00:27:29,222 --> 00:27:30,389
<i>(Martina) Two men from the cartel</i>

544
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:31,490
<i>broke into my house... </i>

545
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:33,090
(Man shouts indistinctly)

546
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:35,993
<i>And told me they had
kidnapped my little girl... </i>

547
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:37,595
<i>- (Screaming)
- and my mother.</i>

548
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:39,330
(Shouts in Spanish)

549
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:44,468
And the men said they would
kill them if I didn't cooperate.

550
00:27:44,536 --> 00:27:49,239
(Martina and men shouting in Spanish)

551
00:27:49,307 --> 00:27:52,141
(Crying)

552
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,745
<i>They gave me a gun and
told me to go to that church</i>

553
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:58,014
<i>and shoot the bride.</i>

554
00:27:58,082 --> 00:28:02,519
If I did, my mother
and daughter would live.

555
00:28:04,154 --> 00:28:06,322
They took my phone

556
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:10,359
and they called the man.

557
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,628
They made me kill that woman.

558
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:16,131
I had no choice.

559
00:28:21,437 --> 00:28:24,872
Alvarez is willing to testify
against the Nuevo Laredo cartel.

560
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,941
You find that interesting?

561
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,244
I find it suspicious.

562
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:31,646
The cartel kidnapped her mother
and daughter. (Photos rustle)

563
00:28:31,714 --> 00:28:32,913
They used it as leverage

564
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:34,782
to force Alvarez to kill the A.D.A... 

565
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,684
something the cartel doesn't
do unless absolutely necessary.

566
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:40,587
What did the D.A.'s office have?

567
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:42,856
(Sighs)

568
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:44,391
(Lowered voice) Nine months ago,

569
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,293
a woman was stabbed to death
in alamo heights by her husband.

570
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:48,128
He walked.

571
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:49,763
S.A.P.D. didn't have enough to charge him.

572
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,765
I was working with
Endelsohn to reopen the case.

573
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:53,198
Why?

574
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:55,000
So I could use the murder rap to flip him,

575
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:57,202
get him to testify.

576
00:28:57,271 --> 00:29:00,273
He's a big asset to
the Nuevo Laredo cartel.

577
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,040
In what context? Smuggler?

578
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,309
No. No, no, no. He's... 

579
00:29:03,377 --> 00:29:04,843
(Bell dings) (Man) Order ready!

580
00:29:07,347 --> 00:29:08,713
- (Man) Pick it up.
- He works for a trucking company.

581
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:10,848
And they use him to
authenticate the paperwork

582
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,619
to transport about $40
million in contraband a year.

583
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,588
All right, he was worth
protecting, and so they did.

584
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:20,292
They killed a District Attorney.
The cartel will do anything.

585
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,526
Alvarez won't cooperate

586
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,662
unless she sees her
mother and daughter again.

587
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,030
- No.
- (Door bell jingles, door closes)

588
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,832
No. There is no way that
I'm risking my informants

589
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,167
on a raid into Mexico

590
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:32,068
for two people who are
probably already dead.

591
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:34,104
Well, then you don't have a case.

592
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,873
You're insane.

593
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,577
(Door bell jingles)

594
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:43,847
If you help me get these people out,

595
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,882
you have a real shot at
taking down a major ring.

596
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,517
It could be a huge win for you.

597
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:49,651
Yeah? What do you get?

598
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,720
Justice.

599
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:55,257
(Scoffs) Justice doesn't
motivate me in to Mexico.

600
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:56,658
- Dan...
- Molly,

601
00:29:56,726 --> 00:29:58,994
I will not risk agency
assets on soft intel.

602
00:29:59,062 --> 00:30:01,063
Period.

603
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:02,331
There's a good chance

604
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:03,732
Alvarez's mother and
daughter will be killed

605
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,534
because I couldn't let the
case close with S.A.P.D.

606
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:08,636
I can't forgive myself.

607
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:14,575
Dan, I'm asking for your help.

608
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:24,251
We do this, we do it alone.

609
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,787
I'll use one contact.

610
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:29,589
I understand.

611
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:33,894
There's an excellent chance
we're gonna die in Mexico.

612
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,072
We're wasting time.

613
00:30:49,885 --> 00:30:51,319
(Man speaks indistinctly) Pull on up.

614
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:52,854
(Dan) My contacts found them.

615
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:54,621
They're being held outside a rodeo arena

616
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:56,490
the cartel uses to move drugs.

617
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:57,891
(Man) I need to see your I.D.

618
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:59,559
- (Metal clanks)
- (Man) All right, there's two.

619
00:30:59,627 --> 00:31:01,828
(Dan) The plan's to tip the
cartel about a false raid,

620
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:04,164
force them to move out so we can move in.

621
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,877
(Door clanks)

622
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:20,946
<i>Cartel thinks the federales
are planning a raid.</i>

623
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:22,448
It's a false set up,

624
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:25,050
so they move out of the area
where you need to go into.

625
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:27,419
They'll move the drugs.

626
00:31:27,487 --> 00:31:30,322
You wait for snipers on rooftops

627
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,957
here, here, and here

628
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:34,326
to head away from the area

629
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,094
<i>where abuelita y la niña are being held.</i>

630
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,131
(Sighs)

631
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:41,065
Once you see them making a move,

632
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,366
you have about 20 minutes

633
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,835
before they find out the raid was false.

634
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,771
When they get back,

635
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,540
we better be far away.

636
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,442
How long before the raid's tipped?

637
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,145
Three hours.

638
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:02,519
You really play the trumpet?

639
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:04,187
(Chuckles)

640
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,023
Every Tuesday night at
the Continental Club.

641
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,625
(Cell phone vibrates)

642
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:12,195
(Vibrates)

643
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,995
<i>Salud.</i>

646
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:26,841

648
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,488
(Lowered voice) Go. Go.

649

656

(Vehicle approaches)

657
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:11,250
(Dan) Cartel's back.

658
00:33:11,318 --> 00:33:12,919
<i>We gotta go now.</i>

659
00:33:12,987 --> 00:33:14,386
Come here. Come on. Come on.

660
00:33:16,456 --> 00:33:20,258

Uhh!

663
00:33:46,184 --> 00:33:47,118
(Window shatters) (Both) Aah!
