[Background chatter]

183
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:40,548
[Sighs]

184
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:57,595
What type of dressing
are you requiring today?

185
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,564
Business.

186
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:01,098
What type of business
might it be?

187
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:03,900
Railroad, but cut the top
and the overcoat,

188
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:05,869
so I can wear this.
Very good.

189
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:07,470
Maybe an open frock
with a Fuller waist?

190
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:09,772
Sounds right.
Inch or two of the cuff showing,

191
00:17:09,806 --> 00:17:11,373
neat in the pants,
and I dress to the left.

192
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:14,376
[Door bell jingles]

193
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,412
And the gentleman's gentleman?

194
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,982
How come I gotta be
a gentleman's gentleman?

195
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:24,251
Why can't I be
a gentleman plain?

196
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:26,219
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
he's right.

197
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:30,122
War's given the negro the right
to decide what he wants, so...

198
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:33,158
What type of suit
will you have, sir?

199
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:35,493
Let's see.

200
00:17:38,497 --> 00:17:42,032
That one there, I can afford.

201
00:17:49,506 --> 00:17:51,407
Yeah, I like that one.

202
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:53,975
Make that one up for me.

203
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,478
The black man chooses,
and the white man pays.

204
00:17:56,512 --> 00:17:59,413
It's a new reckoning
of the world, Mr. Collier.

205
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:01,148
That it is,
Mr. Bohannon.

206
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:02,616
And you, sir?

207
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,950
What side do you dress on?

208
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:06,986
What you mean
what side I dress on?

209
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:09,455
Psst.
Hey.

210
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,930
Thank you,
Mr. Bohannon.

211
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,798
And when you're hiring men
for your railroad,

212
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,600
don't forget
your Irish kinsmen.

213
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,001
When I land this job,
I'll need two or three.

214
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:26,369
That's for sure.
Hundred?

215
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:28,170
- Thousand.
- Ah.

216
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:29,972
The man you'll need to see
is Three-Piece Duffy

217
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:31,039
down at the Points.

218
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:32,707
He knows all the railroad men.

219
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:35,477
If you're with the Union
Pacific, he'll find ya.

220
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:36,844
He ain't with nobody.

221
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:40,047
He barely with me.

222
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:43,517
Oh, Mr. Bohannon.

223
00:18:44,718 --> 00:18:45,952
Burn it.

224
00:18:45,986 --> 00:18:48,988
But shoot it first.

225
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:06,269
I think I dress to the right.

226
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:11,673
Cullen Bohannon.
The board's expecting me.

227
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,942
Elam Ferguson.

228
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:20,681
This way, sir.

229
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:29,421
Mr. Bohannon.

230
00:19:29,456 --> 00:19:32,090
We appreciate all you've done
for the railroad.

231
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,592
Both Doc Durant
and the late Mrs. Lily Bell

232
00:19:34,627 --> 00:19:37,194
spoke highly of
your achievements and abilities.

233
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:40,597
Let's go to it then.

234
00:19:40,632 --> 00:19:42,832
The job of Chief Engineer
and Senior Vice President

235
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:45,401
of Union Pacific has been
awarded to someone else.

236
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:46,436
Yes, sir.

237
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,503
And I aim for it to be mine

238
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:48,937
before I walk out that door.

239
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:51,773
- What's it a question of?
- Vision.

240
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:53,575
And temperament.

241
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,410
Someone whose pedigree
speaks to getting things done

242
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:01,181
in Washington
as well as out on the plains.

243
00:20:01,215 --> 00:20:05,084
Have you ever been
to Washington, Mr. Bohannon?

244
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,752
I am familiar.

245
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:07,920
Well, then you know

246
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:09,621
that even at the highest levels,

247
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:12,224
it's dog eat dog.

248
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:15,893
This man you hired,
he's a real dog fighter then?

249
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:19,630
He comes
with my personal recommendation.

250
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:21,465
He was the Chief Engineer

251
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:23,700
of the Westwood
and Upclair Railway.

252
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:27,536
Yeah, that sounds like
a Shortline Railroad to me.

253
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:29,938
16 miles, but he oversaw

254
00:20:29,973 --> 00:20:32,040
the building
of two major trestles.

255
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:35,410
Yes, your son-in-law
comes well-appointed.

256
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:36,845
Especially with your new role

257
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:39,514
as Undersecretary
of the Railroad.

258
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:41,383
And he's a veteran.

259
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:45,153
Fought with Black Dave Hunter
on the winning side.

260
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,550
All due respect, I don't
doubt your son-in-law's ability

261
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:58,218
to build pretty Bridges
over stony brook streams,

262
00:20:58,253 --> 00:20:59,219
but that's not
what we're facing

263
00:20:59,253 --> 00:21:03,121
out west at the moment.

264
00:21:03,155 --> 00:21:04,689
Is this the best map you have?

265
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:06,690
- It's current.
- It's not very accurate.

266
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,559
Here's where we are.

267
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:10,294
Plains extend here.

268
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:12,195
Here's the beginning
of the red desert.

269
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,562
Now we'll be good along here.

270
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:15,030
Plenty of grazing
for our feed cattle,

271
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,698
mild weather.

272
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,967
Here's where we start
running out of water.

273
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:24,238
I've drawn up some designs...
For water cars.

274
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:28,375
Here are some designs
for dormitory cars.

275
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,111
Keep the men
out of the elements, healthier,

276
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:33,613
more productive.

277
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:34,781
Who will build these?

278
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,215
We'll build 'em together,

279
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,250
just like we'll build
this railroad.

280
00:21:38,285 --> 00:21:40,319
Now here we start hitting
real Indian country hard.

281
00:21:40,353 --> 00:21:44,590
Shoshone, Crow, Kiowa...
some friendly, some not.

282
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:48,093
Oh, um, your son-in-law,

283
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:52,130
has he ever been
in Indian territory?

284
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:56,801
We've started stockpiling
rail and ties here,

285
00:21:56,835 --> 00:21:58,335
waiting for the Missouri
to thaw.

286
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,571
Mmmm, river's already
breaking up here South.

287
00:22:00,605 --> 00:22:02,272
Saw it myself coming over.

288
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:04,007
Central Pacific
was able to work

289
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,008
through most of the winter.

290
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:07,978
Collis Huntington

291
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:10,246
has put them ahead of schedule.

292
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:12,315
Then the race is on, gentlemen.

293
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:13,983
No time to waste.

294
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:16,686
Now this...

295
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,322
These are plans for organizing
the rail-layers and tie crews.

296
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:21,957
Think we can get
more steel laid.

297
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:24,860
Probably 30% more steel

298
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:27,963
if we follow these regimens.

299
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:30,132
[Men murmuring]

300
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:41,209
Were we to take you on
in some capacity,

301
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:42,977
you'd be paid in U.P. stock.

302
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:45,713
We feel that that would
make your involvement

303
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:48,649
more of a personal investment.

304
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:51,519
Congressman Ames...

305
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:54,822
I'm already more invested
than you'll ever know.

306
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:57,357
There's a lot of graves
along this railroad,

307
00:22:57,392 --> 00:22:59,026
marked and unmarked.

308
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,907
Some I laid to rest myself
and some... time or two.

309
00:23:04,665 --> 00:23:07,834
Point is...

310
00:23:07,868 --> 00:23:12,138
I make no apologies
for my temperament.

311
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:16,476
Mr. Bohannon,
I believe you're bleeding.

312
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,680
Surely not from shaking hands
with a shaving razor.

313
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:22,848
Wolves, actually.

314
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:27,620
The kind that bite.

315
00:23:38,156 --> 00:23:40,191
Why don't you shake hands
with the new Chief Engineer

316
00:23:40,225 --> 00:23:41,559
of the Union Pacific railroad?

317
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:44,562
I'd rather shake hands
with the devil.

318
00:23:44,596 --> 00:23:46,230
You may well
before this is over.

319
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:48,566
You made 'em think
I was your Butler or something?

320
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,567
I did, and it worked.

321
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:52,803
Got the job.

322
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:55,839
Now we got men to hire.
Let's go.

323
00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:59,343
[Men and women shouting]

324
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:08,419
I don't like this at all.

325
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:11,455
Safer back home
with them Indians.

326
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:14,124
Meet me back at the hotel
if we get split up.

327
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,895
I'm on you like a tick.

328
00:24:30,808 --> 00:24:34,811
Show these lads
their place of employ.

329
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:41,785
Caught a musket ball at
a bowery party the other night.

330
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:43,954
It's festering a bit.

331
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:45,956
"Either the ball comes out
or the leg comes off,"

332
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,958
says the barber.

333
00:24:47,992 --> 00:24:50,160
Pardon the smell.

334
00:24:50,194 --> 00:24:51,761
I'm Cullen Bohannon,

335
00:24:51,796 --> 00:24:54,130
- new Chief Engineer of the...
- I know who you are...

336
00:24:54,165 --> 00:24:56,633
And who you're pretending
to be.

337
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,268
No pretense, Mr. Duffy.

338
00:24:58,302 --> 00:25:00,603
- I'm in need of railroad workers.
- I know, I know.

339
00:25:00,638 --> 00:25:02,639
Who the hell do you think
put the last two years

340
00:25:02,673 --> 00:25:04,140
on to Durant's pay but was me?

341
00:25:04,174 --> 00:25:07,844
I was hoping
we could maintain it similar.

342
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:08,945
Pleased with the quality
of men, were ya?

343
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:10,662
For the most part.

344
00:25:10,782 --> 00:25:13,983
[Chuckles]
"For the most part."

345
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:17,253
Thems were the Creme
de La Creme I sent Durant.

346
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:19,956
Not the, uh, consumptive
or the weak-backed.

347
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,358
I winnowed 'em clean.

348
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:24,794
You know why?

349
00:25:24,828 --> 00:25:26,028
Mr. Durant's a fine man.

350
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:30,266
He backs up his word
with solid gold.

351
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,867
Locked away in prison now.

352
00:25:31,902 --> 00:25:33,836
Because of Tatterducks.

353
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,439
They're jealous of his acumen.

354
00:25:37,474 --> 00:25:38,807
The man's a genius.

355
00:25:38,842 --> 00:25:40,309
Wouldn't you agree,
Mr. Bohannon?

356
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:42,444
Well...
reckon even a genius

357
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:46,081
can run afoul of the law,
Mr. Duffy.

358
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,351
$1,000 in gold coins

359
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:52,388
for each lot of 500 men
boarded at the station.

360
00:25:52,422 --> 00:25:55,224
McFee counts 'em for me.

361
00:25:55,258 --> 00:25:57,993
Maybe you can have your nigger
there count 'em for you.

362
00:25:58,027 --> 00:25:59,561
That is, of course,
if he can count

363
00:25:59,596 --> 00:26:01,063
beyond his fingers and toes.

364
00:26:01,097 --> 00:26:02,864
The ones
that fall off the train

365
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:05,367
or that arrive with rigor mortis
are not my concern.

366
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:07,703
It's called attrition,
according to Mr. Durant.

367
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:09,838
Something pretty
you wanna say to me, boy?

368
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:13,041
[Chuckles]
The day it's just me and you

369
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:16,545
is the day
your Irish luck run out.

370
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:17,879
You gonna let your nigger

371
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:19,748
speak to me that way,
Mr. Bohannon?

372
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:21,416
He ain't my nigger.

373
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,817
So when do you think
you'll be able

374
00:26:22,852 --> 00:26:25,920
to send out
the first shipment of men?

375
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:28,757
Let us see your gold.

376
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:32,060
I wouldn't show you how much
money even if I had it on me.

377
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:38,066
So you come around here
wasting my time,

378
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,437
not planning
to commence business?

379
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:44,772
Mr. Durant
would never do that.

380
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:47,575
How much coin
do you have on you?

381
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:50,912
Not enough to trouble you,
Mr. Duffy.

382
00:26:53,982 --> 00:26:56,517
It's no trouble at all, sir.

383
00:26:56,552 --> 00:26:58,219
Whatever you have on you
will recompense me

384
00:26:58,253 --> 00:27:01,222
for speaking with you today.

385
00:27:01,256 --> 00:27:04,125
See, I'm a fine judge
of character, Mr. Bohannon,

386
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,960
and I can tell
you have no interest

387
00:27:05,994 --> 00:27:08,062
in dealing with me
or my enterprise.

388
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:10,097
Now that's the first truth
you spoke since we met.

389
00:27:10,132 --> 00:27:12,633
[Men chuckling]

390
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:16,437
Now me and my friend here,
we're gonna back out slow,

391
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:19,206
and this'll be done.

392
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:20,207
[Trigger cocks]

393
00:27:20,242 --> 00:27:22,977
[Overlapping shouting]

394
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,448
[Gunshots] [Screams]

395
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,324
Boy, don't you ever step
out of line like that again.

396
00:27:37,358 --> 00:27:39,226
Don't go for my gun.

397
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,928
Like to got us killed.

398
00:27:40,962 --> 00:27:44,798
Well, you should
have let me have a gun.

399
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:46,566
My grandpappy
was right about you people.

400
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:49,970
You mean when he owned us?

401
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:51,638
Tore a thousand-acre
plantation out of nothing,

402
00:27:51,673 --> 00:27:52,739
he did.

403
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:53,907
Well, you tell your grandpappy

404
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:55,308
we a free people now.

405
00:27:55,343 --> 00:27:57,010
- You tell him that.
- Free?

406
00:27:57,044 --> 00:28:00,080
Well, shit.

407
00:28:00,114 --> 00:28:01,915
Don't you go telling me
about your freedom, son.

408
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:03,950
I know all about it.

409
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:06,786
I'm the one
that paid full price for.

410
00:28:06,821 --> 00:28:10,490
You may be free, but you sure
as shit ain't my equal.

411
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,127
Take 'em off.

412
00:28:16,297 --> 00:28:20,099
Take 'em off.

413
00:28:20,134 --> 00:28:22,535
[Grunts]

414
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,871
Oh, yeah?

415
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:26,973
All right.

416
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:30,576
[Both grunting]

417
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,386
[Knocks on door]

418
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:43,689
Shh.
Might be the landlady.

419
00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:49,428
Come in.

420
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:56,535
Mr. Beale.

421
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,571
Mr. Bohannon.

422
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,540
Telegram.

423
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,598
Actually,
it's for Mr. Ferguson.

424
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:08,905
Thank you, sir.

425
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:13,152
Yeah, he can read.

426
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:16,688
He's also a free man,
in case you hadn't heard.

427
00:29:18,725 --> 00:29:20,751
Eva had the baby.

428
00:29:20,871 --> 00:29:22,850
Yeah.

429
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,230
What is it?

430
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:28,834
There you go
talking that again.

431
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:30,068
I meant is it a boy or girl?

432
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,337
Don't say.

433
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:35,407
Boy's fine.
Girl's sweet too.

434
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,877
- Just say it's healthy.
He- y.

435
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:43,132
You remember this minute,
all right?

436
00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:48,671
Might only come once.

437
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:54,576
Yes, sir.

438
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:57,579
I got me a baby.
[Chuckles]

439
00:30:31,285 --> 00:30:34,287
I'm sorry
for the things I've done.

440
00:30:37,057 --> 00:30:41,761
And... for the things
I left undone.

441
00:30:48,802 --> 00:30:52,738
Feeling like I bit off
more than I can chew, you know?

442
00:30:52,773 --> 00:30:55,441
[Chuckles]

443
00:30:55,475 --> 00:30:57,810
Course you do.

444
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,482
Take off your gun!

445
00:31:05,652 --> 00:31:09,121
We'll have no guns
in the house of the Lord.

446
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,700
This is not
a shooting gallery, sir.

447
00:31:14,661 --> 00:31:16,562
Reverend Corner.

448
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:18,931
It's me, Cullen Bohannon.

449
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:21,100
You married me
and Mary Elizabeth Tate here

450
00:31:21,134 --> 00:31:23,268
back in '56.

451
00:31:25,705 --> 00:31:27,372
Uh...

452
00:31:30,476 --> 00:31:34,313
We... we don't recognize you.

453
00:31:38,151 --> 00:31:41,687
You're welcome to stay
and pray with us,

454
00:31:41,721 --> 00:31:44,456
but...

455
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,492
You'll have to leave
the guns outside.

456
00:31:57,303 --> 00:32:00,305
Good day to y'all then.

457
00:32:06,178 --> 00:32:08,513
I did
what I was supposed to do.

458
00:32:08,547 --> 00:32:10,014
I voted against Bohannon.

459
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:12,450
Your job was not
to vote against Bohannon.

460
00:32:12,484 --> 00:32:15,019
Your job was to get everyone
else to vote against Bohannon!

461
00:32:15,054 --> 00:32:16,487
He was very compelling.

462
00:32:16,522 --> 00:32:20,358
Well, you tell that
to your constituents

463
00:32:20,392 --> 00:32:23,461
when the Union Pacific
bankrupts your state coffers.

464
00:32:23,495 --> 00:32:25,329
You promised
that wouldn't happen.

465
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:28,232
No

466
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:29,901
[whispers] No.

467
00:32:29,935 --> 00:32:31,969
Not when I could run things

468
00:32:32,004 --> 00:32:35,239
through that cloddish
son-in-law of yours.

469
00:32:35,273 --> 00:32:37,074
[Sighs]

470
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,314
You have got
to get me out of here.

471
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:46,350
Thomas, I don't think
I can get you out of here.

472
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:49,420
We frankly have run out
of friendly judges.

473
00:32:49,454 --> 00:32:51,088
There's always
some new appointee,

474
00:32:51,122 --> 00:32:53,390
some... someone freshly elected,

475
00:32:53,425 --> 00:32:55,159
a holder of a lien,

476
00:32:55,193 --> 00:32:57,261
a witness with a faulty memory.

477
00:32:57,295 --> 00:33:00,664
Perhaps a Peeping Tom
or a chambermaid with a tail.

478
00:33:00,699 --> 00:33:05,602
Now you listen to me,
you pissant!

479
00:33:05,637 --> 00:33:08,405
Your fall
will be far greater than mine

480
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:10,574
if Bohannon is not stopped

481
00:33:10,608 --> 00:33:13,443
and I am
not returned the railroad.

482
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,614
I understand.

483
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,187
Good.

484
00:33:24,222 --> 00:33:26,957
Good.

485
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:29,826
[Crowd chatter]

486
00:33:33,631 --> 00:33:35,565
Looks a lot like
Durant's old car.

487
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,868
It is Durant's old car,
just refurbished.

488
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:41,538
Better sleeping quarters,
heating throughout.

489
00:33:41,572 --> 00:33:43,373
Can we get a cot in here
or something for Mr. Ferguson

490
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:45,208
for the ride back to Omaha?

491
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:48,812
I loaned Mr. Ferguson money
for passage on the negro car.

492
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:56,819
Mr. Huntington.

493
00:33:56,854 --> 00:33:59,655
Collis Huntington,
head of Central Pacific.

494
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,325
Whoa.

495
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:05,661
I'm glad I caught you, sir.
Been wanting to meet you.

496
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:09,165
Especially when I heard
you weren't dead.

497
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,803
Mr. Beale, may I have a moment
with Mr. Bohannon, please?

498
00:34:13,837 --> 00:34:17,006
The package on the desk
contains your issued stock.

499
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,943
Thank you, Mr. Beale.

500
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:32,955
You're being paid in stock

501
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,323
because the Union Pacific's lenders

502
00:34:34,357 --> 00:34:37,359
have closed their books.

503
00:34:40,397 --> 00:34:42,297
Government's guaranteeing us.

504
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:44,666
Government's in chaos.

505
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:46,802
Senate wants to impeach the
president for reconstruction.

506
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:48,505
The house is investigating him

507
00:34:48,538 --> 00:34:50,272
for the assassination
of Lincoln.

508
00:34:50,306 --> 00:34:51,673
There'll be no new vote

509
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,642
on railroad funding
until next session.

510
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:56,345
In short, Mr. Bohannon,
you and your railroad are broke.

511
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:58,347
Got stockpiles in Missouri.

512
00:34:58,381 --> 00:35:00,282
I'll be in Wyoming by fall.

513
00:35:00,316 --> 00:35:03,118
No, you won't, Mr. Bohannon,
regardless of your pace.

514
00:35:03,152 --> 00:35:05,187
I was making 2 mile a day.

515
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:06,721
Sometimes 5
when the work was good.

516
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:08,557
You know
what progress I'm making?

517
00:35:08,591 --> 00:35:10,725
- Hmm?
- 12 a day.

518
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,893
12 miles?

519
00:35:11,928 --> 00:35:14,296
12 inches a day.
[Chuckles]

520
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,298
Through solid granite.

521
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:18,166
Now that may
not sound like much,

522
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,335
but I'm almost
through the sierras.

523
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:23,838
And I just received 5,000 pounds
of Nitroglycerin

524
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:26,508
and 11,000 Chinamen
who do not get sick

525
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,877
and are happy to work
with half pay.

526
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:31,145
Now I am backed
by the Bank of England,

527
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,481
funded by all the tons
of glittering gold

528
00:35:33,515 --> 00:35:35,550
found in the streams
of California.

529
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:37,752
It's the Golden State,
Mr. Bohannon.

530
00:35:37,786 --> 00:35:39,654
Looking forward to meeting you
there at the border then.

531
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:42,156
Oh, you haven't
read the papers, sir.

532
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:43,825
My friends in congress
have just voted

533
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,993
to lift
my building restrictions.

534
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:48,729
Now, once I'm through the
mountains, it's all downhill.

535
00:35:48,764 --> 00:35:50,731
I intend to cross
the California border

536
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:52,834
and be in your camp
before you know it.

537
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:54,936
The stretch between Nebraska
and California is mine.

538
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:59,874
No, sir, it belongs
to whomever can cross it first.

539
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,776
Now, based on your reputation,

540
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,678
I'm offering you a chance
to cross it with me,

541
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,614
but from the west,
and you'll be paid in gold.

542
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:11,118
Not in some worthless paper.

543
00:36:11,153 --> 00:36:14,088
[Chuckles] Huh.

544
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,426
Well, I...
Already gave my word

545
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:21,195
to the gentleman
at Credit Mobilier,

546
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:23,964
and that's about all
I got left, so...

547
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:26,934
[Train rattles]

548
00:36:26,968 --> 00:36:28,969

549
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:35,275
[In distance] Board.

550
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,044
All aboard.

551
00:36:37,078 --> 00:36:40,414
Chicago, Omaha,

552
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,383
and all points west.

553
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:47,054
It was a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Bohannon.

554
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:49,089

555

556
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:53,126
 Hmm.

557
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:09,579
Omaha!
The stop is Omaha.

558
00:37:10,748 --> 00:37:13,149

00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:35,753
Well...
look at you.

562
00:37:35,873 --> 00:37:37,907
How you feeling?

563
00:37:37,941 --> 00:37:40,777
She came out kicking
and tearing.

564
00:37:40,811 --> 00:37:43,446
- She?
- Mm-hmm.

565
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:47,517
Can I see her?

566
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:49,552
Yeah.

567
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:56,325
- She's moving all right.
- [Chuckles]

568
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,362
- You all right?
- Yeah.

569
00:38:12,342 --> 00:38:15,477
You can't tell much
with newborns.

570
00:38:15,512 --> 00:38:18,547
They're all wrinkled up

571
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:21,016
and splotchy-looking.

572
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:25,220
She's beautiful.

573
00:38:29,926 --> 00:38:32,594
Thank you.

574
00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:40,435
She like her daddy.
[Chuckles]

575
00:38:42,772 --> 00:38:45,040
I'm glad you're back.

576
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:54,416
Ladies.

577
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:58,219
Aye, Mr. Bohannon.

578
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:00,255
You look great.
How was New York?

579
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:02,691
It was an open sewer,
Mr. McGinnes.

580
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:04,392
Mm.

581
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:08,096
My new hat don't fit me either.

582
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,998
Welcome back, sir.

583
00:39:10,032 --> 00:39:12,667
We're all very excited about,
um, our new prospects west,

584
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:13,668
aren't we, girls?
Yes.

585
00:39:13,702 --> 00:39:15,336
[All laugh]

586
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:16,771
It'll be a few more days
before we ship out.

587
00:39:16,805 --> 00:39:18,206
We need to collect some crews.

588
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,908
Actually, um...

589
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:24,712
Once the word got back that
you're the new Chief Engineer,

590
00:39:24,747 --> 00:39:26,447
workers started
coming in from all over,

591
00:39:26,482 --> 00:39:29,450
began loading up the trains.

592
00:39:29,485 --> 00:39:31,786
That's a nice vote
of confidence, I would say.

593
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,089
Wouldn't you, Mr. Bohannon?

594
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,559
When do we roll out?

595
00:39:38,594 --> 00:39:41,896
At your leisure and signal.

596
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,931
Sir.

597
00:39:50,672 --> 00:39:52,306
Yes, sir.

598
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,574
Mr. Bohannon.

599
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:54,942
[Laughs]

600
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,377
Freedmen ready to get to work?

601
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:59,113
Hmm, damn lowlife
scrabble hereabouts

602
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,615
taking all our hard-saved
railroad money.

603
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,117
- Mm?
- Mm-hmm.

604
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,385
Treating us like
it's backsliding times.

605
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:05,886
- Mm-mm.
- Yes, sir.

606
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,321
Anywhere but here.

607
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:09,423
- Even Hell On Wheels?
- Hmm.

608
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:12,092
Sound like heaven
when you say it.

609
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:13,794
Don't forget your man
Psalms here when you make

610
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,395

Walking Boss list, huh?

611
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,631
There's a lady
on the cowcatcher, Mr. Bohannon.

612
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,999
Alive or dead?

613
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:23,170
I'm not sure what's going on.

614
00:40:23,204 --> 00:40:25,505
Say, Mr. Bohannon,
is that, um...

615
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,307
Is that Sparky's pipe?

616
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,342
Was.

617
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,981
Ruth?

618
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:41,521
I'm so sorry,
Mr. Bohannon.

619
00:40:41,555 --> 00:40:44,758
I was gathering my thoughts
for a prayer before we set off.

620
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:47,660
[Bell ringing]

622
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,636
You can pray with me
if you want.

623
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:01,174
I'll leave you in charge
of that department.

624
00:41:11,518 --> 00:41:13,719
Heavenly Father,

625
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:16,322
You have given us a vision
of this railroad

626
00:41:16,356 --> 00:41:19,125
which will bind our nation.

627
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:21,627
Lord Christ,
when you came among us,

628
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:23,629
you proclaimed God's Kingdom

629
00:41:23,663 --> 00:41:27,399
in towns and lonely places
such as these.

630
00:41:28,602 --> 00:41:31,403
Grant that your presence
be known

631
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:34,506
as this railroad
is built across this land.

632
00:41:38,778 --> 00:41:42,147
Have mercy on those
who labor on it.

633
00:41:42,182 --> 00:41:45,584
Send us
honest and able leaders.

634
00:41:45,618 --> 00:41:47,820
May peace prevail
with righteousness,

635
00:41:47,854 --> 00:41:51,890
justice with order,
and help us eliminate poverty,

636
00:41:51,925 --> 00:41:54,159
oppression along the way.

637
00:41:54,194 --> 00:41:57,195
And especially eliminate evil.

638
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,008
All this we ask

639
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:12,143
in God's Holy name.

640
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,047
Amen.

641
00:42:44,586 --> 00:42:48,322
[Indistinct chatter]

642
00:42:52,694 --> 00:42:55,462
I see why they call this place
"Hell On Wheels."

643
00:42:55,496 --> 00:42:57,064
Rough men, loose women,

644
00:42:57,098 --> 00:42:59,232
whiskey, sin, and guns.

645
00:42:59,267 --> 00:43:02,035
It ain't
a church social, ma'am.

646
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,670
I'm not sure your bosses
at Credit Mobilier

647
00:43:03,705 --> 00:43:06,707
would want me to put <i>that</i>
in the newspaper.

648
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:09,342
What is it that holds you to
this enterprise, Mr. Bohannon?

649
00:43:09,377 --> 00:43:10,644
Every piece of steel we lay

650
00:43:10,678 --> 00:43:12,646
puts us closer
to somewheres else.

651
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,881
That's about all I can say.

652
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:19,019
So it's more personal
than just laying rail.

653
00:43:19,053 --> 00:43:22,589
You're the writer.
Ho!

654
00:43:22,623 --> 00:43:24,924
Mr. Bohannon,
people of this country

655
00:43:24,959 --> 00:43:28,161
believe the railroad is robbing
the National Treasury.

656
00:43:28,195 --> 00:43:30,530
My job is to dissuade my readers
of that notion.

657
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:33,600
Unfortunately,
our brief interview

658
00:43:33,634 --> 00:43:35,335
was not enough to dissuade me.

659
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:38,104
And it ain't my job
to fix what people think.

660
00:43:38,138 --> 00:43:39,872
In fact, it is.

661
00:43:39,907 --> 00:43:42,208
You are the face of the
Transcontinental Railroad now.

662
00:43:42,242 --> 00:43:44,944
And either this is
a brave and noble endeavor,

663
00:43:44,978 --> 00:43:47,113
or it's Sodom and Gomorrah.

664
00:43:47,147 --> 00:43:50,716
Which is it?

665
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:52,451
The sooner you help me
accurately report

666
00:43:52,486 --> 00:43:53,953
what's going on out here,
the sooner I can leave

667
00:43:53,987 --> 00:43:56,689
and make both our lives
less miserable.

668
00:43:56,723 --> 00:43:58,958
And for the record,
I covered the war '63 to '65.

669
00:43:58,992 --> 00:44:01,427
I know the difference between
hell and a church social.

00:46:01,112 --> 00:46:03,914
How is that any different
from indentured servitude?

712
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:05,983
Union Pacific offers
free rail passage

713
00:46:06,017 --> 00:46:08,018
and a week's wages on arrival.

714
00:46:08,053 --> 00:46:09,720
We got more applicants
than we got work.

715
00:46:09,754 --> 00:46:11,355
Really?

716
00:46:11,389 --> 00:46:14,091
Your idea again?

717
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:18,862
Didn't much care for the labor
bosses I met in New York.

718
00:46:30,141 --> 00:46:31,441
New cemetery runs
from the sawmill

719
00:46:31,476 --> 00:46:33,410
up to the Ridge line.

720
00:46:33,444 --> 00:46:35,178
Ain't a day goes by
we don't put some one or two

721
00:46:35,213 --> 00:46:39,950
in the ground up there,
most from railroad mishaps.

722
00:46:39,984 --> 00:46:42,218
And the others?

723
00:46:42,253 --> 00:46:46,623
Spare time mishaps.

724
00:46:46,657 --> 00:46:51,461
Is that where the fair-haired
maiden of the west is buried?

725
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:57,867
No, she's buried in
a wild flower field she liked.

726
00:46:57,902 --> 00:47:00,536
- Did you know her?
- A bit.

727
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:01,971
Well, you must've known her
better than that

728
00:47:02,006 --> 00:47:04,374
if you knew where she wanted
to be buried.

729
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:05,642
Mrs. Bell should've left
Hell On Wheels

730
00:47:05,676 --> 00:47:07,543
when she had the chance.

731
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:09,979
This ain't no place for a lady,

732
00:47:10,013 --> 00:47:13,316
less'n she's a whore.

733
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,318
I can assure you,
Mr. Bohannon,

734
00:47:15,352 --> 00:47:18,054
I am neither a lady
nor a whore.

735
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:19,622
Figured you'd have to be
a little bit of both

736
00:47:19,656 --> 00:47:21,157
being a newspaper woman.

737
00:47:21,191 --> 00:47:23,059
Get outta here.

738
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:25,394
Huh.

739
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:26,629
You figured wrong.

740
00:47:26,663 --> 00:47:28,764
[Horse neighs]

741
00:47:31,468 --> 00:47:33,903
You Bohannon?

742
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:36,505
I am.

743
00:47:38,675 --> 00:47:40,342
Keep your railroad
off my property.

744
00:47:40,377 --> 00:47:43,379
I won't tell you again.

745
00:47:51,054 --> 00:47:53,589
Where'd they come from?

746
00:47:53,623 --> 00:47:56,458
No idea.

747
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:58,694
Train for Omaha leaves
in an hour.

748
00:47:58,728 --> 00:48:01,730
I expect you won't
wanna miss it.

749
00:48:41,036 --> 00:48:45,907
[Mutters indistinctly]

750
00:48:45,941 --> 00:48:47,709
Howdy.

751
00:48:47,743 --> 00:48:49,877
Who are you?

752
00:48:49,912 --> 00:48:51,512
You come pawin' around
for turmoil,

753
00:48:51,547 --> 00:48:52,580
you best think twice, friend.

754
00:48:52,614 --> 00:48:55,016
This is my office.

755
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:57,418
Mr. Ferguson.

756
00:48:57,452 --> 00:48:59,987
Dick Barlow.
Just arrived from Omaha.

757
00:49:00,022 --> 00:49:03,557
Didn't Mr. Bohannon tell you
to expect me?

758
00:49:03,592 --> 00:49:06,560
No.

759
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:08,863
What you want in here?

760
00:49:08,897 --> 00:49:11,031
Well, I can tell by looking,
you ain't short a hat size,

761
00:49:11,066 --> 00:49:13,400
so I guess you know.

762
00:49:13,435 --> 00:49:16,070
I'm new Chief
of Railroad Police.

763
00:49:16,104 --> 00:49:19,840
You work for me now.

764
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,108
Coffee?

765
00:49:21,142 --> 00:49:23,010
My grandpap taught me
how to make it.

766
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:25,112
The trick is not to over-boil.

767
00:49:25,146 --> 00:49:28,882
And, of course, the sock.

768
00:49:28,917 --> 00:49:30,417
Now, uh, I use a clean one.

769
00:49:30,451 --> 00:49:33,420
But pap swore
the riper the sock,

770
00:49:33,454 --> 00:49:35,789
the richer the brew.

771
00:49:35,823 --> 00:49:39,026
I like a dollop of fresh cream
in mine,

772
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,029
but it ain't real regular
I come across it.

773
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:46,366
And kicking don't get you
nowhere less'n you're a mule.

774
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:50,470
So mostly,
I just take mine black.

775
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:52,272
Mr. Bohannon
ain't said nothing

776
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:55,876
about me working for nobody.

777
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,411
Well, it ain't no good cold now.

778
00:49:58,446 --> 00:50:01,448
Go on.

779
00:50:06,654 --> 00:50:10,590
That's it.

780
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:12,325
Mm.

781
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:14,727
That'll get your hair
out of the butter every time.

782
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,597
[Laughs]

783
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,245
Don't want no trouble.

784
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,581
- Came to talk.
- What about?

785
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:38,317
Think you know.

786
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:51,497
Come ahead.

787
00:51:01,007 --> 00:51:03,027
You survive the war?

788
00:51:05,478 --> 00:51:07,379
- I did.
- You a Johnny Reb?

789
00:51:07,414 --> 00:51:10,649
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I was.

790
00:51:15,722 --> 00:51:17,389
So you know a little
about what it's like,

791
00:51:17,423 --> 00:51:21,026
somebody comes,
takes your land.

792
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,696
Everything I had's been took.

793
00:51:24,731 --> 00:51:27,466
Indians killed my father
and my brother,

794
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,534
his wives and kids.

795
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:32,804
My wives and I,
we buried 'em on the same hill

796
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,241
I pulled our surveyor stakes
out of.

797
00:51:36,275 --> 00:51:38,476
My family bled for this land,
Mr. Bohannon,

798
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:43,081
carved this place out
of a wilderness nobody wanted.

799
00:51:45,551 --> 00:51:48,386
It is
by Heavenly Father's decree

800
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:51,723
that we are here,
and it shall be by His will,

801
00:51:51,757 --> 00:51:53,691
not yours, that we leave.

802
00:51:53,726 --> 00:51:57,529
Even God can't stop
the railroad, Mr. Hatch.

803
00:52:00,432 --> 00:52:02,500
It would destroy all we built,

804
00:52:02,535 --> 00:52:05,570
take away our home.

805
00:52:05,604 --> 00:52:07,372
Mm.

806
00:52:07,406 --> 00:52:09,741
You have my word.

807
00:52:09,775 --> 00:52:11,442
You'll get a square deal.

808
00:52:11,477 --> 00:52:13,511
Now, now,
that's the best I can do.

809
00:52:13,545 --> 00:52:16,247
- Could go around.
- Boy.

810
00:52:16,281 --> 00:52:18,616
Ain't nothin' but wilderness
and Lamonites out here, father.

811
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:20,985
I said that's enough.

812
00:52:33,165 --> 00:52:35,733
You will excuse
my son's manners.

813
00:52:35,767 --> 00:52:39,737
He's got some growing
still to do.

814
00:52:46,645 --> 00:52:50,948
[Sighs]

815
00:52:50,982 --> 00:52:55,652
Tell you what.
Um...

816
00:52:55,687 --> 00:52:58,322
Let me see if my surveyors
can't find a way around.

817
00:52:58,356 --> 00:53:01,225
Now, that...
that's not a promise.

818
00:53:01,259 --> 00:53:03,327
Ift can't be done,
you'll still have to move.

819
00:53:03,361 --> 00:53:08,465
But it don't cost nothing
to try.

820
00:53:11,669 --> 00:53:15,072
Well, a journey
through these lands

821
00:53:15,106 --> 00:53:18,775
at this hour is a foolish one,
Mr. Bohannon.

822
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:21,845
You are welcome to stay
till morning.

823
00:53:21,879 --> 00:53:25,615
Much obliged.

824
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:36,493
[Horse neighs]

825
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:47,170
[Both breathing heavily]

826
00:54:05,522 --> 00:54:06,656
[Clatter]

827
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,492
[Gasps]

828
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:29,308
[Grunting]

829
00:54:29,343 --> 00:54:31,644
Seen me a Mormon man
killed once.

830
00:54:31,678 --> 00:54:34,146
[Grunts] Liberty, Missouri...

831
00:54:34,481 --> 00:54:36,315
During the war.
[Grunts]

832
00:54:36,349 --> 00:54:39,117
As if them white folk didn't
have enough to fight about,

833
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:41,751
county sheriff run him through
with a sword

834
00:54:41,871 --> 00:54:43,388
on account of him
being a "Palgemist."

835
00:54:43,423 --> 00:54:46,158
[Grunts]

836
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:54,361
Yep, they didn't like them
no "Palgemists"

837
00:54:54,481 --> 00:54:55,468
in Liberty, Missouri.

838
00:54:55,588 --> 00:54:57,252
Like they Mormons
didn't like them no negroes.

839
00:54:57,286 --> 00:55:01,723
[Grunts]

840
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:03,925
Yeah.
They a nasty bunch.

841
00:55:03,959 --> 00:55:06,427
[Grunts]

842
00:55:06,462 --> 00:55:08,897
I think
you mean "polygamist."

843
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,332
[Exhales] What'd I say?

844
00:55:11,367 --> 00:55:13,768
"Palgemists."

845
00:55:13,802 --> 00:55:15,069
Well, I knew it was
something like that.

846
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:17,271
Why a man gotta get
hisself killed

847
00:55:17,306 --> 00:55:18,940
over being a polygamist?

848
00:55:18,974 --> 00:55:20,575
It's the custom
of having more than one wife

849
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:21,943
at the same time.

850
00:55:21,977 --> 00:55:23,878
More than one wife, you say?

851
00:55:23,912 --> 00:55:25,846
At the same time?

852
00:55:25,881 --> 00:55:28,816
Well, damn.
No wonder they nasty.

853
00:55:34,556 --> 00:55:36,957
Sand, mud, lime.

854
00:55:36,992 --> 00:55:39,293
Soil like that no good
for the grade, boss.

855
00:55:39,327 --> 00:55:42,296
Take a lot of lumber
to build it.

856
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:44,231
Yeah, rock wall be better,
but that take time

857
00:55:44,266 --> 00:55:46,367
and rock, which we ain't got.

858
00:55:46,401 --> 00:55:48,902
I've surveyed several routes
through here, Mr. Bohannon.

859
00:55:48,937 --> 00:55:51,705
Sand hills stretch at least
a hundred miles to the north.

860
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,440
We'd have to go South
to get around that farm.

861
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,709
- How far?
- 40 mile, maybe more.

862
00:55:55,744 --> 00:55:57,611
40 mile'll put us behind
schedule by five weeks.

863
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,647
Yes, sir.

864
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:07,187
[Bell rings]

865
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,572
I met the new police chief.

866
00:56:25,606 --> 00:56:31,244
You ain't happy,
track runs both ways.

867
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:35,515
[Bell ringing continues]

868
00:56:35,549 --> 00:56:38,017
Where's the livestock?
It's complicated.

869
00:56:38,052 --> 00:56:39,319
Tell you
what's complicated, son.

870
00:56:39,353 --> 00:56:41,688
3,000 hungry men.

871
00:56:41,722 --> 00:56:43,456
What I mean is

872
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:46,826
I've been on the job
for two days.

873
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,995
And deciphering these books
is quite the task.

874
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:50,997
Near as I can tell,

875
00:56:51,031 --> 00:56:52,865
Mr. Durant formed
several companies

876
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,935
to supply livestock
to the railroad.

877
00:56:55,969 --> 00:56:58,104
Now that he's departed,

878
00:56:58,138 --> 00:57:02,175
the contracts
have been canceled.

879
00:57:02,209 --> 00:57:04,277
Then find some other
damn place, Sean.

880
00:57:04,311 --> 00:57:06,112
Council Bluffs, Denver,
shit, Chicago...

881
00:57:06,146 --> 00:57:10,049
I would, um, but it seems
that Mr. Durant has,

882
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:12,718
in addition to canceling
our contracts

883
00:57:12,753 --> 00:57:14,653
with his companies,

884
00:57:14,688 --> 00:57:18,150
cornered the market on livestock
in Omaha as well.

885
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,625
Shit!

886
00:57:19,659 --> 00:57:21,527
Should've killed that son of
a bitch when I had the chance.

887
00:57:21,561 --> 00:57:24,697
May I quote you on that,
Mr. Bohannon?

888
00:57:28,602 --> 00:57:30,502
You don't say nothing to her
about railroad business.

889
00:57:30,537 --> 00:57:33,405
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

890
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,142
- Still here?
- Missed my train.

891
00:57:37,177 --> 00:57:40,412
Don't say I didn't warn you.

892
00:57:45,218 --> 00:57:47,152
[Knock at door]

893
00:57:47,186 --> 00:57:48,854
Oh.

894
00:57:48,888 --> 00:57:51,990
We missed you at services
this morning, Mr. Bohannon.

895
00:57:52,025 --> 00:57:55,160
[Laughs]

896
00:57:55,194 --> 00:57:58,563
Was there something
I can help you with?

897
00:57:58,598 --> 00:58:01,633
Thought I'd look in is all.

898
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:05,904
You gave us a good place...

899
00:58:05,938 --> 00:58:11,776
High, dry ground
upwind of the slaughterhouse.

900
00:58:11,811 --> 00:58:14,679
- Thank you.
- It's good.

901
00:58:14,714 --> 00:58:19,317
It's good for the men, I mean.

902
00:58:22,054 --> 00:58:23,922
And you?

903
00:58:28,294 --> 00:58:30,929
Oh.
Sorry.

904
00:58:30,963 --> 00:58:33,064
Uh...
[Sniffs]

905
00:58:33,098 --> 00:58:36,067
Railroad has to move a family
of homesteaders off their land.

906
00:58:36,101 --> 00:58:40,404
They're digging in.
And, uh, they're Mormon.

907
00:58:40,439 --> 00:58:41,739
I wonder if you've had
any cause to know

908
00:58:41,773 --> 00:58:44,942
what they might be like
as people.

909
00:58:44,977 --> 00:58:46,644
The Latter Day Saints are not

910
00:58:46,678 --> 00:58:49,480
a legitimate Church of Christ.

911
00:58:49,514 --> 00:58:51,549
They treat their women
as slaves.

912
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,551
They take child brides.

913
00:58:53,585 --> 00:58:55,219
They're a violent people.

914
00:58:55,253 --> 00:58:57,254
They'll fight then, you think?

915
00:58:57,289 --> 00:58:59,890
It has been their way.
Yes.

916
00:58:59,925 --> 00:59:02,159
They got children with 'em.

917
00:59:02,194 --> 00:59:04,128
Then you'll find another way.

918
00:59:04,162 --> 00:59:06,931
By God's Grace.

919
00:59:06,965 --> 00:59:11,902
God's been slack
with the Grace of late.

920
00:59:11,937 --> 00:59:16,006
Then show them yours,
Mr. Bohannon.

921
00:59:20,545 --> 00:59:24,348
What I'm proposing is
a major new commercial hub,

922
00:59:24,382 --> 00:59:27,751
the most important railroad city
in the United States.

923
00:59:27,785 --> 00:59:33,357
And it will be right here
in your backyard.

924
00:59:33,391 --> 00:59:36,993
That is literally my backyard.

925
00:59:37,028 --> 00:59:40,931
You see that pretty confluence
of good sweet-water streams?

926
00:59:40,965 --> 00:59:44,434
Well, it ain't much,
but it's on my land.

927
00:59:44,469 --> 00:59:47,337
My husband left me all of this
when he passed in '62.

928
00:59:47,371 --> 00:59:50,040
Well, it may be
your land now, madam.

929
00:59:50,074 --> 00:59:52,108
But the Union Pacific Railroad

930
00:59:52,143 --> 00:59:53,810
will reach it before the year
is out.

931
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:56,813
And, through eminent domain,
they will claim it.

932
00:59:56,847 --> 00:59:58,114
That's against the law.

933
00:59:58,149 --> 00:59:59,282
It <i>is</i> the law.

934
00:59:59,316 --> 01:00:00,950
And by law,

935
01:00:00,985 --> 01:00:03,286
the Union Pacific
is compelled to offer you

936
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,355
a fair market price
for your land,

937
01:00:05,389 --> 01:00:06,723
currently $1.50 an acre.

938
01:00:06,757 --> 01:00:08,458
[Laughter]

939
01:00:08,492 --> 01:00:11,327
- I'd never sell for that.
- And you won't have to.

940
01:00:11,362 --> 01:00:13,196
Because as a representative

941
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:16,332
and major stockholder
of Credit Mobilier,

942
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:20,069
I am prepared
to offer you $100 per acre,

943
01:00:20,104 --> 01:00:24,974
thus waiving eminent domain.

944
01:00:25,008 --> 01:00:27,844
- What's the rub?
- Ah, well...

945
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:30,913
In order to waive
eminent domain,

946
01:00:30,948 --> 01:00:34,083
we must build
a railroad terminus

947
01:00:34,117 --> 01:00:35,918
and a town on the property,

948
01:00:35,952 --> 01:00:37,820
which we will.

949
01:00:37,854 --> 01:00:39,855
Every pound of beef,
every ton of ore,

950
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:42,925
every fruit, vegetable,
every bale of hay

951
01:00:42,959 --> 01:00:45,694
from either side
of the Mississippi

952
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:49,164
must ship through our town.

953
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:52,534
You will become rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

954
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:53,869
Weren't you in jail
just a month ago?

955
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:55,437
- Yes.
- And you're broke,

956
01:00:55,472 --> 01:00:56,438
according to the newspapers.

957
01:00:56,473 --> 01:00:57,773
Flat broke.

958
01:00:57,807 --> 01:00:58,907
Well, how do you expect
to pay us

959
01:00:58,942 --> 01:01:00,109
for our property then?

960
01:01:00,143 --> 01:01:02,578
From construction funds

961
01:01:02,612 --> 01:01:05,214
advanced to me
by the Union Pacific Railroad.

962
01:01:05,248 --> 01:01:07,549
You were kicked off
Union Pacific for stealing.

963
01:01:07,584 --> 01:01:10,085
Union Pacific, Credit Mobilier,

964
01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:13,388
different pockets
to the same pair of pants.

965
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:15,957
When the judge understood that,
I was released.

966
01:01:15,992 --> 01:01:17,893
You're in Omaha now, New York.

967
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:19,461
Money won't buy you
judges here.

968
01:01:19,495 --> 01:01:23,598
Opportunity is a powerful
elixir, Mrs. Palmer.

969
01:01:23,633 --> 01:01:25,467
Right.

970
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:28,403
So you're borrowing money
you don't have

971
01:01:28,437 --> 01:01:30,238
from a company
you don't work for

972
01:01:30,273 --> 01:01:31,906
to buy property
you can't afford

973
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:33,875
to build a city
that doesn't exist.

974
01:01:33,909 --> 01:01:35,276
Spearheading, as it were.

975
01:01:35,311 --> 01:01:38,313
A new way of doing business
in America.

976
01:01:45,955 --> 01:01:47,889
If all difficulties were known

977
01:01:47,923 --> 01:01:50,892
at the outset of a long journey,
Mr. McGinnis,

978
01:01:50,926 --> 01:01:54,929
few of us would ever
embark at all.

980
01:02:04,873 --> 01:02:07,308
Have you got the money?

981
01:02:13,949 --> 01:02:16,584
I'm very uneasy about this.

982
01:02:16,618 --> 01:02:18,419
If Mr. Bohannon finds out...

983
01:02:18,453 --> 01:02:20,588
You are doing nothing wrong.

984
01:02:20,622 --> 01:02:22,790
You are managing
railroad funds,

985
01:02:22,824 --> 01:02:27,127
and you are managing them well.

986
01:02:27,162 --> 01:02:30,164
Have you got
something else for me?

987
01:02:35,036 --> 01:02:38,806
This is the, uh,
telegraph routing code

988
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,675
for the Union Pacific.

989
01:02:41,709 --> 01:02:43,477
You'll be able to eavesdrop

990
01:02:43,511 --> 01:02:46,013
on all of Mr. Bohannon's
business.

991
01:02:46,047 --> 01:02:48,682
Excellent.

992
01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:57,124
Will you be paying
me today, Mr. Durant?

993
01:02:57,158 --> 01:03:01,495
All in due time,
Mr. McGinnis.

994
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:06,233
Oh, don't look so glum.

995
01:03:06,267 --> 01:03:11,371
My current situation
is but a temporary setback.

with a winner.

Not like this.

1008
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:46,572

it'll be your throat!

1064
01:06:51,544 --> 01:06:52,945
Mr. Hatch?

1065
01:06:56,049 --> 01:07:00,252
State your business!

1066
01:07:00,286 --> 01:07:02,954
I'm Dick Barlow,

1068
01:07:08,094 --> 01:07:10,796
Think you know why we're here.

1069
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:14,132
I already told the other one,
we ain't leaving.

1070
01:07:17,136 --> 01:07:19,244
You ain't got any choice.

1071
01:07:19,364 --> 01:07:20,772
That's what
we come to tell you.

1072
01:07:20,806 --> 01:07:23,441
We ain't afraid to fight
for what's ours.

1073
01:07:23,476 --> 01:07:26,945
You best leave
on out of here now.

1074
01:07:26,979 --> 01:07:30,482

ain't gonna get us no...

1075
01:07:30,516 --> 01:07:32,283

[Groans]

1079
01:08:05,951 --> 01:08:07,451
I need 75,000 ties

1080
01:08:07,485 --> 01:08:09,219
delivered 25 miles
beyond the end of the rails

1081
01:08:09,254 --> 01:08:10,587
before the first of the month,

1082
01:08:10,824 --> 01:08:12,022
a hundred barrels
of blasting powder.

1083
01:08:12,057 --> 01:08:13,757
Make sure we got enough
wranglers to tend them cattle

1084
01:08:13,792 --> 01:08:17,027
when they get here...

1085
01:08:17,062 --> 01:08:18,495
from Denver.

1086
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,898
Eva!

1087
01:08:24,736 --> 01:08:26,603
What happened?

1088
01:08:26,638 --> 01:08:28,105
The Mormons shot him.

1089
01:08:28,139 --> 01:08:29,106
Shit.

1090
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,474
Careful, careful.

1091
01:08:30,508 --> 01:08:31,675
I got his legs.

1092
01:08:33,678 --> 01:08:35,045
Eva!

1093
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:37,481
Eva, we need you!

1094
01:08:37,515 --> 01:08:39,316
Elam, the baby!

1095
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:42,152
You're the closest thing
we got to a doctor.

[Baby crying]

1098
01:09:04,542 --> 01:09:05,975
Go get me some onion broth.

1099
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:07,544
You!

1100
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:09,379
Go to the hotel restaurant,

1101
01:09:09,413 --> 01:09:11,414
get me some onion broth now.
Go!

1102
01:09:11,448 --> 01:09:12,582
Was it the old man or the boy?

1103
01:09:12,616 --> 01:09:14,350
I don't know for certain.

1104
01:09:14,385 --> 01:09:16,920
- Certain you don't know.
- Told you I don't know.

1105
01:09:16,954 --> 01:09:18,154
Well, I know for certain
there's a man lying here

1106
01:09:18,188 --> 01:09:19,555
with a bullet in him.

1107
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:20,556
I just told you
I ain't seen him.

1108
01:09:20,591 --> 01:09:23,059
Will you two stop it?

1109
01:09:23,093 --> 01:09:24,260
Shut that baby up.

1110
01:09:24,294 --> 01:09:27,063
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1111
01:09:27,097 --> 01:09:28,431
Here.

1112
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:30,366
Prop him up.

1113
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,767
Get him up.

[Coughing]

1117
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:51,787
Yeah, I can smell the onion
broth through the wound.

1118
01:09:51,822 --> 01:09:53,422
He's gut-shot, Elam.

1119
01:09:53,456 --> 01:09:55,624
He ain't gonna make it.

[Baby crying]

1121
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:59,695
Take that damn baby outside.

1122
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:01,964
No, wait.

1123
01:10:01,998 --> 01:10:05,934
Bring her here.

1124
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:09,238
Bring her over here.
Please.

1125
01:10:09,272 --> 01:10:11,373
Let me see her.

1126
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:14,142
Please let me see her.

1127
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,783
Oh.

1128
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:24,215
[Chuckles]

1129
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:31,927
She's beautiful,
Mr. Ferguson.

1130
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:34,796
Just like you said.

1131
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:08,629
You wanted it.

1132
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,376
Not like this.

1133
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:21,575
Well?

1134
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:35,122
All right.
Telegraph the fort.

1135
01:11:35,156 --> 01:11:37,191
Tell the major we need help
evicting them homesteaders.

1136
01:11:39,661 --> 01:11:41,862
You want a railroad story?

1137
01:11:41,896 --> 01:11:44,531
Follow me.

1138
01:12:23,193 --> 01:12:25,795
Mr. Hatch!

1139
01:12:25,829 --> 01:12:30,433
This is Cullen Bohannon of
the Union Pacific Railroad.

1140
01:12:30,467 --> 01:12:32,802
I have a writ of execution here

1141
01:12:32,836 --> 01:12:36,272
for the killing of
my Chief of Police.

1142
01:12:36,306 --> 01:12:39,141
Come on out.

1143
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,682
You don't, and these soldiers
will burn you out.

1144
01:12:46,716 --> 01:12:48,150
I won't be able to stop them.

1145
01:12:52,022 --> 01:12:54,890
You got one minute,
Mr. Hatch.

1146
01:13:14,811 --> 01:13:19,281
United States Cavalry
was not built for waiting.

1147
01:13:19,315 --> 01:13:22,350
We didn't come here
to kill women and children.

1148
01:13:22,385 --> 01:13:25,854
A disorganized brain
is lacking in moral principles.

1149
01:13:25,888 --> 01:13:27,856
Are you aware of that,
Bohannon?

1150
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:29,524
Not something I ponder nights.

1151
01:13:29,558 --> 01:13:31,326
Moral principles are
the first line of defense

1152
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,895
against criminal behavior.

1153
01:13:33,929 --> 01:13:36,297
You learn
something new every day.

1154
01:13:36,332 --> 01:13:37,899
Without moral principles,

1155
01:13:37,933 --> 01:13:39,968
these Mormons will inevitably
turn to violence

1156
01:13:40,002 --> 01:13:43,571
to solve their problems,
just like the heathens.

1157
01:13:43,606 --> 01:13:46,741
Am I right about that, chief?

1158
01:13:46,775 --> 01:13:49,077
What he talking about?

1159
01:14:07,429 --> 01:14:10,398
Y'all keep your barrels down.

1160
01:14:19,808 --> 01:14:22,676
You and your boys
put your guns down.

1161
01:14:22,711 --> 01:14:25,613
I told you,
stay off my property

1162
01:14:25,647 --> 01:14:27,748
or there'll be hell to pay.

1163
01:14:27,782 --> 01:14:29,450
And I told you if I couldn't
find a way around,

1164
01:14:29,484 --> 01:14:31,418
the U.S. Government would
rightfully claim its land.

1165
01:14:34,122 --> 01:14:37,257
You murdered
my Chief of Police.

1166
01:14:37,292 --> 01:14:39,460
He was trespassing.
He was warned.

1167
01:14:39,494 --> 01:14:41,528
You have to stand accountable.

1168
01:14:41,563 --> 01:14:44,565
I am the priesthood holder
of my family, Mr. Bohannon.

1169
01:14:44,599 --> 01:14:48,802
Without me,
they will not survive.

1170
01:14:48,837 --> 01:14:50,204
You should've thought
about that

1171
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:52,039
before you pulled that trigger.

1172
01:14:52,073 --> 01:14:54,608
They won't survive.

1173
01:14:56,077 --> 01:14:57,444
I'll see to it they get to

1174
01:14:57,478 --> 01:14:59,079
the Mormon settlement
at Fort Smith.

1175
01:14:59,113 --> 01:15:00,914
How's that?

1176
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:55,034
- He done it.
- Father?

1177
01:16:08,915 --> 01:16:11,517
Did you kill that man, son?

1178
01:16:11,551 --> 01:16:12,751
Tell me the truth now.

1179
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:31,570
Yes, sir.

1180
01:16:31,604 --> 01:16:35,774
Mr. Ferguson,
this boy shoot Dick Barlow?

1181
01:16:38,411 --> 01:16:40,011
I ain't sure.

1182
01:16:44,217 --> 01:16:47,252
Good God, man, get on with it.

1183
01:16:47,286 --> 01:16:49,588
You'd have me hang him?

1184
01:16:49,622 --> 01:16:51,389
It's the law, Bohannon.

1185
01:16:51,424 --> 01:16:53,758
You said so yourself, and you
are obliged to uphold it.

1186
01:16:53,793 --> 01:16:57,662
We do not make exceptions
to the law out here.

1187
01:16:57,697 --> 01:16:59,731
You realize he'll hang.

1188
01:16:59,765 --> 01:17:03,068
He's just a boy.

1189
01:17:03,102 --> 01:17:04,435
You're gonna tell me the truth.

1190
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:05,703
I told you the truth!

1191
01:17:05,738 --> 01:17:08,106
Son, you got a different story,

1192
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,575
you best tell me right now.

1193
01:17:15,147 --> 01:17:18,316
He's just a boy.

1194
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:28,793
Not today he ain't.

1195
01:17:28,827 --> 01:17:30,595
All right.

1196
01:17:34,933 --> 01:17:36,968
Father.

1197
01:17:37,002 --> 01:17:38,703
Come here.

1198
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:41,205
- Father!
- Come on, boy.

1199
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:44,175
- Come on.
- Easy.

1200
01:17:46,511 --> 01:17:49,113
Father!

1201
01:17:49,147 --> 01:17:50,814

1202
01:17:50,849 --> 01:17:52,249

as it creeps across the country

when not swinging a hammer
or laying track.

1217
01:19:15,477 --> 01:19:18,813

as little as $3,

who replaced "Doc" Durant

as Chief Engineer of
the Union Pacific Railroad.

1227
01:19:57,352 --> 01:20:02,456
I can tell you he is a man
for whom honor is sacred

1228
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:06,460
and virtue impermanent.

1229
01:20:09,964 --> 01:20:12,966

he calls home,

to build the railroad,
we don't yet know.

1235

been the business

1236

and corrupt.

1237
01:22:53,192 --> 01:22:55,493
You owe me a life

1238
01:22:55,527 --> 01:22:57,862
for the one
you took from me today.

1239
01:23:06,705 --> 01:23:10,374
I suspect our new Chief
Engineer to be neither.
