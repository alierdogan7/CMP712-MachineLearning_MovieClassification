00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,360
[Crack]

2
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
My friend Grey Wolf likes to play tricks.

3
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,880
Next time I kill you.

4
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,320
I'm glad you put it off.

5
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,440
- Any reason for this?
- Because you are here.

6
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,800
I'm here to see your brother.
Red Cloud and I happen to be friends.

7
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,240
[Grey Wolf] There is no friendship between
red man and white. The fight is to the end.

8
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,640
Ride back to your people.
There is no room for you here.

9
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,640
You've grown a big mouth, Grey Wolf.

10
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,520
I didn't come to talk to a big mouth,
I've come to talk to a big man.

11
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,520
- Hello, Red Cloud.
- Johnny Hawks.

12
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,680
- I was told you were dead.
- Somebody lied.

13
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,600
I did a little fighting in the war.

14
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,080
White man against white. We were hoping
you would kill each other off.

15
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,320
- Didn't last that long.
- Too bad.

16
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,520
[Baby cries]

17
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,360
Where are the rest of your people?

18
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,200
Hunting.

19
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,200
Hunting what?

20
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,640
Why are you here?

21
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm on my way to the new fort.

22
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,000
I wanted to say hello to an old friend.

23
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,840
Why are you here?

24
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,840
- There's a wagon train at the fort.
- I know.

25
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,640
Will you let it pass through?

26
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,920
Why not? I am at peace.

27
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,840
- Between killings?
- I kill only those who break my law.

28
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,040
What law is that?

29
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,520
White men must not come into our land
looking for gold.

30
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,800
Gold? I didn't know there was any around.

31
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,920
White men must not come
and trade whiskey for gold.

32
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,960
It takes two to make a trade.

33
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,720
I've punished both.

34
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,400
Come.

35
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,560
- They broke the law.
- They look sorry for it.

36
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,440
I'll help you keep your law.
But we'll punish our own lawbreakers.

37
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
Good.

38
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,920
You believe a man
who has killed so many of us?

39
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,320
He's killed twice as many of mine.

40
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,560
Is the captain of the fort to be trusted?

41
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,080
Come and speak to him.
You two might get along good.

42
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,720
- I will be there tomorrow.
- I'll tell him.

43
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,760
Johnny Hawks.

44
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,960
Not until you have eaten with your friends.

45
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,880
Thanks, Red Cloud, but I think I should...

46
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,640
I am kind of hungry.

47
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,760
Open it.

48
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,520
Looks like gold.

49
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,360
Feels like it.

50
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,440
Tastes like gold. Where does it live?

51
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,480
- I hope you will never learn.
- Why?

52
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,960
It would make me unhappy to see
your hair growing on a stick.

53
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,000
[Chuckles]

54
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,880
Any one of my people
who tells a white man, dies.

55
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,280
But you're rich. Gold will buy horses,
blankets. You're very rich.

56
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,920
Will it bring back the buffalo
your people will kill?

57
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,520
Will it clean the streams your people will
fill with filth as they search for yellow iron?

58
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,560
Will it bring back the beauty of the land?

59
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,560
I'm already rich in the only wealth I want -

60
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,560
that which you see about us.

61
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,320
Think of these things
while you are waiting for sleep.

62
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,520
Are you angry because
I saw you in the water?

63
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,360
I've seen your mother wash you
when you were that high.

64
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,200
I am not that high any more.

65
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,320
No, you're not.

66
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,720
[Mimics owl hooting]

67
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,800
[Hooting continues, faint]

68
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,800
[Hooting]

69
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,280
[Horse neighs]

70
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,880
Go away. No more gold.

71
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,320
No more gold for whiskey. I tell Red Cloud.

72
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,960
[Gunshot]

73
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,160
[Men shouting]

74
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,840
[Dog barking]

75
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,760
- Why are you killing people?
- I didn't kill anybody.

76
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,800
- Who did?
- What's it to you?

77
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,640
Who did?

78
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,200
- Fella named Chivington.
- Where are you from?

79
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,840
The new fort, the wagon train.

80
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,520
- What were you doing here?
- Just doing some night hunting.

81
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,200
- Shooting owls?
- Anything that showed.

82
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,880
Couple of Indians come by,
Chivington gets scared, starts shooting.

83
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,840
Next thing I know,
this redskin here jumps me.

84
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,160
I need this fool for a witness.

85
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,080
- I ask for the prisoner.
- He is my brother's prisoner.

86
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,680
What does that mean?

87
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,200
I gotta fight him for your hide.

88
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,160
- What happens if you lose?
- Then my troubles will be over.

89
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,160
Yours will just begin.

90
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,920
[Horse neighing]

91
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,600
Take the white man and go.

92
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,800
Sure was close, I was kinda worried.
Never was so nervous in my life.

93
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,560
That'll settle your nerves.

94
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,200
- Will you come to the fort?
- I don't know.

95
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,000
The captain will punish
whoever's responsible.

96
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,640
I would like to see white man's justice.

97
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,920
Come to the fort and you'll see it.

98
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,960
I will be there tomorrow.

99
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,760
You got a fair fist, almost took my jaw off.

100
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,480
I realised you were doing it for my good.

101
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,920
Always like to give a stranger
a helping hand.

102
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,320
I appreciate that.

103
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,760
Funny how they enjoy burning men alive.
I don't care for it.

104
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,120
- Better stop shooting night owls.
- What do you mean?

105
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,160
These fell out of your pants.

106
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,800
I got these nuggets in a trade.

107
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,640
Hot lead for gold?

108
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,280
- All right, my partner shot an Indian.
- Willing to tell the fort captain?

109
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,320
That what you want me to do?

110
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,320
Get a lot of gold from the Indians?

111
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,160
At first. But this morning, nothing.

112
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,400
- Wanna try again?
- Uh-uh.

113
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,800
Be easier finding
where the Indians are getting it.

114
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,640
That's why you were soaping up the
big chief. I thought were after the stuff.

115
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,280
Be a shame to burn a smart fella like you.

116
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,240
- You know where it is?
- The gold field? I got a hunch.

117
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,680
You'll need help.
There'll be plenty for both of us.

118
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,120
- What about your partner?
- Chivington?

119
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,800
I ain't particular what happens to him.

120
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,160
My lucky piece. We can go far
with a little luck, partner?

121
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,200
So right... partner.

122
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,840
It's Wes Todd!

123
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,560
Hey, Wes, you're supposed to be dead.

124
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,720
Yeah?

125
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,760
He ain't even wounded.

126
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,200
Disappointed?

127
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,880
Chivington said there was a massacre.

128
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,920
- Who got massacred?
- Him!

129
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,480
I would've, if not for Johnny Hawks here.

130
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,600
Johnny Hawks?
Didn't we hear about you back in Laramie?

131
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,520
- I've been there.
- I'm sure glad to see you here.

132
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,560
How soon will the troops be here?

133
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,840
- Where's, er, Chivington?
- He was in the saloon.

134
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,480
What are you running for?

135
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,360
With the Sioux on the warpath,
I'm staying inside.

136
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,960
We're wasting our time.

137
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,600
Chivington knows where them Indians are.

138
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,720
Captain should wipe 'em out,
every man, woman or child.

139
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,600
Ever do much Indian fighting?

140
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,000
I fought enough Yankees to know
how to deal with any kind of skunk.

141
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,040
We just lost one war,
you want to lose another?

142
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,400
[AII laugh]

143
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,000
Step down off that horse.

144
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,000
Sam, that's Johnny Hawks,
the Indian fighter.

145
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,560
Well, I wouldn't want to harm nobody
that kills Indians.

146
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,360
Hold it, Wes.

147
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,920
[Trader Joe] The captain can't make us
wait here to be massacred, it ain't human.

148
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,520
You gotta remember,
Indians are wild animals -

149
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,760
when they taste blood, you gotta kill 'em.

150
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,880
- Right, Chiv.
- Let me tell you,

151
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,560
when I seen my poor friend Wes
lying dead in a pool of blood,

152
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,840
being scalped in front of my eyes,

153
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,680
I knew what my duty was -

154
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,760
to fight my way out of there,
come to the fort and warn the people.

155
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,280
Give me another drink, Jim.

156
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,680
That's an interesting story. I'd like you
to come and tell it to Captain Trask.

157
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,040
I already told him.

158
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,040
Let's tell it to him again.

159
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,680
I ain't taking orders from strangers.

160
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,560
Maybe an old friend could persuade you.

161
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,000
[Trader Joe] Wes Todd.

162
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,720
I thought you was dead.

163
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,160
Well, I just ain't, Chiv.

164
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,400
I guess he's persuaded.
Let's see the captain.

165
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,200
- What did you hit me for?
- Shut up.

166
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,040
- Play along.
- I don't get this.

167
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,120
When the reinforcements arrive,
we must fight, teach Red Cloud a lesson.

168
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,800
Sir, I agree.

169
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,640
I'm trying to prevent a war, not start one.

170
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,840
Man from Laramie is here. Johnny Hawks.

171
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,440
Send him in.

172
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,120
About time.

173
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,320
- Howdy, Captain.
- Mr Hawks.

174
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,440
- How many men did Laramie send?
- Just me.

175
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,560
One man can't handle an uprising.
I don't care who he is.

176
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,120
What uprising?

177
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,600
A band of Sioux ran amok last night,
scalped one of our men.

178
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,960
- They did?
- Chivington saw it.

179
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,280
He's right outside. Come in.

180
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,480
Take off your hat.

181
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,800
- [Lieutenant Blake] Who's he?
- The man who was scalped.

182
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,400
- What's the meaning of this?
- Well, sir...

183
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,800
Is this the man you said was scalped?

184
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,360
Yes, sir, but I didn't have...

185
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,000
Have they finished the guardhouse yet?

186
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,160
- Just about, sir.
- Lock him up.

187
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,400
Yes, sir.

188
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,880
- I'm glad you weren't scalped.
- Lock him up.

189
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,840
I would've been burned alive
if it weren't for Johnny.

190
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,920
- You were there?
- Thought I'd see the Indians first.

191
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,720
Now you know the trouble we're in.

192
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,760
The trouble's not with the Indians.

193
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,280
It's settlers like Chivington
trading whiskey for gold.

194
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,120
I wish I could get rid of that wagon train.

195
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,040
I was sent to guide them
through the Sioux country.

196
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,680
I can't send women and children out
with Indians on the warpath.

197
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
They're not on the warpath.

198
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,960
Red Cloud wants to
settle things peaceably.

199
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,080
You think we can trust him?

200
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,480
He's worried if he can trust you.

201
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,920
Why?

202
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,760
Any of his people break the law,
Red Cloud puts them to death.

203
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,880
- You want me to hang Chivington?
- We're not Indians, we're civilised.

204
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,320
- But you gotta do something.
- I put Chivington in the guardhouse.

205
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,800
Sure, but don't neglect his partner.

206
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,200
Partner?

207
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,720
He was with him.

208
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,160
Lock him up.

209
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,160
Now, where do you suppose
I can meet Red Cloud?

210
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,720
- Lock this one up too.
- How about right here?

211
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,480
It would be a mistake
to bring the enemy here.

212
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,120
- I agree.
- I disagree. I'll take responsibility.

213
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,920
- But Captain...
- It's all settled.

214
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,160
How long would it take you
to get Red Cloud here?

215
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,760
He's on his way now.

216
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,680
Excuse me.

217
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,480
Wonderful, got it finished just in time.

218
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,720
[Blacksmith hammering]

219
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,440
[Neighing]

220
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,120
- How many Indians you kill?
- Just enough to stay alive.

221
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,200
Russ Jenkins said you killed more Indians
than Davy Crockett.

222
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,360
Ma don't like Indian fighting, says it's silly.

223
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,920
- What's your pa say?
- Ain't got a pa.

224
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,040
- But I got a grandpa.
- What's he say?

225
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,400
He's in Oregon.
Have you got a real Indian arrow?

226
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,560
- Not on me but I'll get you one.
- Off a dead Indian?

227
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,400
- Off a live one, if you don't mind.
- Ah...

228
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,400
Or you can get one yourself tomorrow
from Red Cloud.

229
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,440
- He's coming here?
- That's right.

230
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,280
- Tomorrow?
- That's what I said.

231
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,760
- Smokin' sassafras...
- [Susan] Tommy!

232
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,320
- Where have you been?
- The Indians are coming!

233
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,360
Stop that nonsense. Get down.

234
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,280
They are too.
Johnny Hawks just told me so.

235
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,840
Russ Jenkins! Russ Jenkins!

236
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,520
Russ Jenkins!

237
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,280
So you're the Indian fighter fella.

238
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,520
Why's a man like you scaring
little boys about Indians?

239
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,400
They're coming to sign a peace treaty.

240
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,440
Last treaty didn't do me much good -
my husband died at Vicksburg.

241
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,080
- Sorry to hear it.
- It ain't your fault.

242
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,720
Or is it?

243
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,960
Which side of the war were you on?

244
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,040
- I'm kind of afraid to mention.
- Don't be scared of me.

245
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,080
Care to have supper with us?

246
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Thank you. Won't put you out?

247
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,120
Feeding a man never put me out,
providing he's got an appetite.

248
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,960
Thank you. I got the appetite.

249
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,600
Wash your hands.

250
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,320
[Neighing]

251
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,480
[Military drumming]

252
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,040
Indians!

253
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,800
I can't figure you.
I can't figure Johnny Hawks.

254
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,920
- I can't figure nothing.
- Don't you see what he's doing?

255
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,040
I figure I owe you a bust in the nose.

256
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,680
- Johnny's a smart operator.
- I owe him a bust in the nose too.

257
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,720
He puts over this peace powwow
so he can have the field to himself.

258
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,680
Anybody else goes after gold
gets shot or hung.

259
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,080
That's the way he fixes the peace treaty,

260
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,720
to scare off everybody but Johnny Hawks.

261
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,760
I'm plugging him when I get out of here.

262
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,680
You're plugging nobody till I tell you.

263
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,720
He's our partner.

264
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,880
[Man snoring loudly]

265
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,720
- Shut up.
- [Snorts]

266
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,320
[Snoring]

267
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,240
- Hold it!
- [Resounding boom]

268
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,120
[? Lively music playing]

269
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,400
[Children singing]

270
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,280
[Laughing]

271
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,360
How many apple trees
to an acre in Oregon?

272
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,080
- 500?
- And that ain't counting taters.

273
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,840
They're twice as big
as the ones in Michigan.

274
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,240
? When a captain runs, he's a mastermind

275
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,080
? When a corporal runs,
he's the coward kind

276
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,320
? Though the captain he may drink a lot

277
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,960
? It's the corporal who's a drunken sot... ?

278
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,880
Howdy, Captain.

279
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,600
Susan, if we was to put
our heads together in Oregon,

280
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,040
- we could grow apple trees...
- Terrific.

281
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,400
Susan, there's been nothing like 'em
since the Battle of Shiloh.

282
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,680
Johnny!

283
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,920
Hey, I ain't finished talking yet.

284
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,640
Look at that contrast.
Real black and white.

285
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,320
Notice the grouping. Absolute artistry.

286
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,440
Captain Trask.
Didn't know he was that handsome.

287
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,040
How do you like this one of Red Cloud?

288
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,000
Looks he swallowed a stick.

289
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,000
- I gotta get him one.
- I printed six of each.

290
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,640
Look at that. Absolute art, isn't it?

291
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,880
You can read the buttons on their uniform.

292
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,480
These are going into the history books.

293
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,520
Howdy, Captain.

294
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,640
Come on, Johnny.

295
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,880
Johnny, what's the idea
hiding yourself in the saloon?

296
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,720
You were dancing with another,
I was trying to forget.

297
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,480
Make up for it now.
Come on, Johnny Hawks.

298
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,320
Mom, he shouldn't dance,
he's an Indian fighter.

299
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,280
That's all right, Tommy,
this is a war dance.

300
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,960
- How far will you come with us?
- Up to Shoshone country.

301
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,920
- Be safe to leave us there?
- Shoshones are friendly.

302
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
- But they can be stirred up.
- I'll see to that.

303
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,520
You can hold me tighter,
I ain't made of glass.

304
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,840
Too bad you're getting such a late start.
Quite a brawl last night.

305
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,600
It's all right. We'll make
Spring Rock by sundown.

306
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,520
Todd and Chivington?
What are they doing here?

307
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,440
- Nothing I can do.
- Send them to Laramie for trial.

308
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,520
What good would it do? Wes Todd
changed his story, claims self-defence.

309
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,880
We should shoot 'em now, try 'em later.

310
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,800
- Not while I'm watching.
- You could turn your back.

311
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,640
They'll behave.

312
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,800
If they're seen here again,
I'll turn them over to Red Cloud in person.

313
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,880
You're real generous with
something you don't want. Be seeing you.

314
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,040
[Wes] Thanks for getting us
out of the jailhouse, partner.

315
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,840
Don't thank me. You carry
your luck around your neck.

316
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,080
Could be you're right.
Maybe some of it'll rub off on you.

317
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,880
It might. We're gonna be
real close on this trip.

318
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,560
Me and Wes'll be right behind you.

319
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,400
That's a pleasant thought.

320
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,320
[Briggs] Johnny.

321
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,760
Look at that scenery.

322
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,440
- What's the matter with it?
- Needs photographing.

323
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,480
I like it the way it is.

324
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,840
When I was working for Mr Brady,
photographing the Civil War,

325
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,880
I said to him, Mr Brady...

326
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,920
I always call him mister.

327
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,760
I said, Mr Brady, I'm not a genius like you,

328
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,360
but you're gonna be proud of me cos I'm
gonna photograph the whole Wild West.

329
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,040
Why?

330
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,960
I want everyone to see it.

331
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,920
Why?

332
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,960
When they see it, they'll come, thousands
of them. Isn't that reason enough?

333
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,440
That's reason enough
to bust that camera over your head.

334
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,280
Don't you want to open up
the West to civilisation?

335
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,320
Come here.

336
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,480
Ah, maybe you won't understand this.

337
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,040
To me, the West is like a beautiful woman.

338
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,920
My woman.

339
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,520
I like her the way she is,
I don't want her changed.

340
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,920
I'm jealous, I don't want
to share her with anybody.

341
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,040
Uh-uh.

342
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,080
I'd hate to see her civilised.

343
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,760
Would you rather I didn't take any photos?

344
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,560
If you don't, others will.

345
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,880
It's so beautiful.

346
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,480
Come on, there's plenty more up ahead.

347
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,400
Oh, here, I'll give you a hand.

348
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,240
Come on. Give me your arm.

349
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,480
Angel with us? Come on, let's go.

350
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,520
[Briggs] Come on, Angel.

351
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,120

? There on a beautiful... ?

373
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,800
That's an Indian knife, ain't it?

374
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,160
- Used to be.
- Did you fight for it?

375
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,160
Yep. Quite a tussle.

376
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,280
Tell us. Will you, Johnny? Tell us?

377
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,880
No stories now. You get to bed. Come on.

378
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,720
I don't wanna go to bed.

379
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,760
Good night, Tommy.

380
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,720
In you go. See you tomorrow. [Chuckles]

381
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,720
Think we'll see any Sioux
before we get through?

382
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,760
Hope so. They're good for trading.

383
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,400
Stealing and killing.

384
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,520
No more than most people I know.

385
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,560
- Like Indians, don't you?
- Yeah, I like Indians.

386
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,520
I like whites too.

387
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,640
- Johnny.
- Yeah?

388
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,920
Why don't you come through to Oregon?

389
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,040
What'll I do in Oregon?

390
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,600
It's rich country. Every man's entitled
to 640 acres, free and clear.

391
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,920
- I can't see myself behind a plough.
- Why not?

392
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
- I'm no good at plantin' seeds...
- Why not?

393
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,880
Cos he's a Indian fighter, that's why!

394
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,000
You get back to bed and you stay there.

395
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,600
Boy's getting to be a problem.

396
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,480
You're a fine woman, Susan.
I wish I had half your character.

397
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
I got enough for both of us.

398
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,000
It'd take more than you think. I'm shiftless.

399
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,960
- Training would take care of that.
- It's in my bones.

400
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,480
When I'm supposed to be tending crops,
I'd be off fishing. I'm no good for farming.

401
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,520
Who's talking about farming?

402
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,920
I'd want my husband out shooting and
trapping, bringing home fish and game.

403
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,200
Farming wouldn't hardly interfere.

404
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,040
Some men are
natural born husbands but...

405
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,200
- I just ain't good for that.
- You ain't never tried.

406
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,560
Well... Well, Susan, it hurts me
to own up to this, but...

407
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,480
I ain't fit for marriage.

408
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,640
Sure hate to hear a man run himself down.

409
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,680
I've given it a lot of thought...

410
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,920
Hiya, Will.

411
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,560
Thanks for the apple.

412
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,680
I've got some horse inspecting to do.
See you in the morning.

413
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,600
As the old saying goes,
two's company and three's a crowd.

414
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,240
Should've thought of that
before you came crashing in here.

415
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,080
Susan, any place you are is where I belong.

416
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,560
There's something I'd like to tell you
but I ain't had the chance.

417
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,600
I'm the best apple grower
ever to come out of Michigan.

418
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,240
Hey, that's a big fella.

419
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,240
About six rattles, he must be five feet long.

420
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,000
- What you got?
- Rattler.

421
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,640
I'll show you how to kill a rattlesnake.

422
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,160
[Wes] Hey, Johnny!

423
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,760
[Women screaming]

424
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,040
Blew his head right off.

425
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,080
I told you. That's the best way
to kill a rattler.

426
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,160
Flipped that snake right at him.
What if he'd missed?

427
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,600
No chance.

428
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,320
I never miss a snake.

429
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,600
Tommy, catch.

430
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,920
Thanks, Johnny!
Look, Mom, Johnny killed a rattler.

431
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,000
All right, everybody, let's move on.

432
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,440
[Men] Yah! Yah!

433
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,080
Hey!

434
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,840
- Giddup there!
- Giddup! Yah!

435
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,720
That was a close shave.

436
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,000
But I was ready,
I got good medicine for snakebites.

437
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,440
Hey, you mean I have to go
find another snake?

438
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,680
- What are they palavering about?
- Did you fix it up with Trader Joe?

439
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,400
He'll give us blasting powder, shovels,
everything, for an equal cut.

440
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,720
Too many coming in for an equal cut.

441
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,920
- I don't trust him.
- Who, Trader Joe?

442
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
- No, Johnny Hawks, you meathead.
- Oh.

443
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,280
[Morgan] Mr Hawks!

444
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,320
- Ain't the main trail down there?
- Yep.

445
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,520
Why go this way?
It's a hard pull up them hills.

446
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,000
Think how easy it'll be
sliding down the other side.

447
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,560
That's right in the middle of Sioux country.

448
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,640
- We're friendly with the Sioux.
- Are they friendly with us?

449
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,680
We've got this far, haven't we?

450
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,320
I ain't seen no Indians.

451
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,160
Depends how you look. I've counted 39.

452
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,000
- See that mountain top?
- I see it.

453
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,760
That's six more. That makes 45.

454
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,960
Haw! Get 'em up! Come on!

455
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,960
- Thanks, Johnny.
- What for?

456
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,280
Taking us close to the Indians.
I'll get great pictures.

457
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,920
Glad you're happy. That makes two of us.

458
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,320
Come on, Angel.

459
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,880
How come we're bedding down early?

460
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,760
The horses must be tired.
Uphill all the way.

461
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,160
Ain't the horses give the orders.

462
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,440
Johnny's got a gold bug in his head.

463
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,480
Let's see where it takes him.

464
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:33,040
[Woman screams] Keep your nose out of
here, you Peeping Tom! Some people!

465
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,760
Brought your knife back.

466
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,800
Remember?

467
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,160
Here.

468
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,280
Don't you want it back?

469
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,920
Throw it.

470
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,840
[? Guitar playing]

471
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,920
[Wolf howls]

472
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,400
- He back yet?
- Uh-uh.

473
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,200
You lummox,
how could you let him get away?

474
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,240
How'd I know he'd be so crooked?

475
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,200
He won't dig gold at night.

476
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,240
Might as well be working with a blind man.

477
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,400
We'll follow him tomorrow, won't we?

478
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,840
Just like we was tattooed on him.

479
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,840
Susan, I've been wanting to tell you
about something on my mind.

480
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,560
New kind of fertiliser. Off'n them buffalos.

481
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,160
Oughta be as good as
horse and cow fertiliser, wouldn't you say?

482
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,640
Mom, what's fertiliser?

483
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,080
Something Mr Crabtree has in his mind.

484
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,120
- You finish. It's past your bedtime.
- Ahh...

485
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,640
Indians!

486
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,440
[? Guitar continues]

487
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,320
- Just a minute.
- [? Guitar stops]

488
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,080
- They seem friendly.
- They'll slit our throats.

489
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,120
- They want to trade.
- Don't let them go.

490
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,680
Don't let them inside this wagon circle.

491
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,040
Maybe you're right, Sam.
Build a trading fire outside the circle.

492
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,560
Mom, buy me something from the Indians!

493
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,760
Stay here. They've got mean faces.

494
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,440
It's all right, Susan.
Just act like they was neighbours.

495
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,080
They're here for business.
I'll get my merchandise.

496
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,880
Don't waste no time, they're all cheats.

497
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,600
You fellas want to trade?

498
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,400
[Chatter]

499
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,480
[Woman] Look at the canoes.
[Man] More Indians.

500
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,520
[Woman] They want to trade.

501
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,280
You got beans? You got flour?
You got cloth?

502
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,520
[Man] Nice fresh meat they got.

503
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,440
I'll give you something for these ducks.

504
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
- What do you want?
- Beans.

505
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,480
- You see him?
- Who?

506
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,120
- Our old pal Crazy Bear.
- Who's he?

507
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,040
That's our fella with the gold.

508
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,640
- I'll trade with him.
- No, keep the others busy.

509
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,760
Get ready.

510
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,120

We got beans. That deer for these beans?

Big deer, little beans. No.

522
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,080
That's a pretty necklace.

523
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,360
I don't want a necklace,
I want a bow and arrow. Please, Mama.

It's our old buddy, Crazy Bear.

You give me drink for this?

We ain't trading, Crazy Bear.
We're just having a little party.

- Because I forgot.

- You're white, I'm Indian.

549
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,760
- What's that got to do with it?
- You go away and forget.

550
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,360
- I stay and remember.
- I gotta go.

551
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,040
When the wagons are through, I'll be back.

94 people up a mountain,
two days out of their way, just to see you.

01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,040
- It's too late for that.
- Going back to your Indian friends?

685
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,640
Yes.

686
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,680
- What for?
- To find Todd and Chivington.

687
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,760
- I'm not interested in them.
- That's our only chance.

688
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,920
- Get back to your post.
- There's only one way to survive.

689
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,800
If we hand over the men
who killed Red Cloud's brother...

690
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,440
I don't want to hear your Indian palavering.

691
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,760
You led that wagon train to them,
deserted your post.

692
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,800
You're responsible for what happened.

693
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,520
If any of us get out of this alive,
you'll pay for it, Mr Indian Fighter.

694
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,040
Indian fighter, hell - Indian lover!

695
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,080
Get back to your post.

[Susan] Johnny.

698
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,520
I didn't think anyone was talking to me.

699
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,240
- Sorry what the men did.
- I had it coming.

Russ Jenkins says
we'll be dead by morning.

701
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,480
Don't believe everything he tells you.
You take care of your ma.

702
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,520
- You going away?
- For a while.

703
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,480
- Where are you going?
- Finish a job.

704
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,320
- Make sure you get to Oregon.
- Wish you wouldn't go.

705
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,280
- He wouldn't go unless he had to.
- I don't want him to.

706
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,760
Can't he take us to Oregon
and stay with us?

707
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,640
- I can't, Tommy.
- Why not?

708
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,240
Cos he's an Indian fighter, that's why.

709
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,280
Take good care of your ma.

710
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,920
Johnny.

711
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,520
You'll come through.
You're a hard fella to catch, Johnny Hawks.

712
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,360
Thanks.

713
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,120
Man going over the stockade!

714
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,640
It's Johnny Hawks!

715
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,160
[Blake] Shoot! Shoot him!

716
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,600
[Gunshot]

717
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,160
I knew he was yellow,
running away saving his rotten hide!

718
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,800
- What's going on?
- Johnny Hawks is running off.

719
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,880
Put up that gun.

720
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,680
I warned you a week ago
to get reinforcements.

721
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,120
But you listened to him
saying what fine people Indians are.

722
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:24,160
Now he's leaving us here to die.
We'll all be scalped like Schaeffer!

723
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,920
Sorry, sir.

724
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,200
Johnny.

725
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,960
Onahti, I need your help. Your father's
attacking the fort in the morning.

726
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,560
- You must go.
- We've got to stop the massacre.

727
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,920
- It's too late.
- It can't be.

728
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,040
Take me to where the gold comes from.

729
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,120
You want the gold.

730
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:24,040
No. I want two men who've gone there.
I must hand them to Red Cloud.

731
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,080
- I was warned not to tell.
- Take me.

732
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,560
Onahti, the massacre must be stopped.

733
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,600
Or there'll never be a life for us,

734
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,720
you and me.

735
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,840
Trust me.

736
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,000
I trust you, Johnny.

737
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,640
[Water splashing]

738
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:20,320
- [Chiv] Powder's all in.
- All right, we'll set her off.

739
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,960
[Chiv] How much gold you think is here?

740
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,000
Don't move, Wes. Drop your gun belt.

741
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,600
Thought you might be
here already, partner. What kept you?

742
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,280
I was delayed. A little Indian trouble.

743
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:37,080
- Too bad.
- Left in a hurry, didn't you?

744
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,680
We didn't even have time to say goodbye.

745
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,880
You left something behind.

746
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,560
Grey Wolf was holding that for you.

747
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,560
Put up your gun,
there's plenty here for us all.

748
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:55,080
I'm not here for gold,
just you two nuggets. Come on.

749
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:59,840
Where we going? To the captain to tell him
we shot another Indian in self-defence?

750
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:03,000
I'm gonna let you tell it to Red Cloud.

751
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,680
- Can't do that.
- Oh, yes, I can.

752
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,480
- They'll burn us alive.
- It'll be in a good cause.

753
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,720
I didn't kill him, Wes did.

754
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,560
Keep moving.

755
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:17,400
We're equal partners. If you don't trust us,
we'll give you your share first.

756
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,360
Nothing to worry about.

760

[Hooting]

761
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:53,600
This is the man
who killed your brother Grey Wolf.

762
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,880
- You fought my brother for his life.
- I was wrong.

763
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,000
Take him now and stop the massacre.

764
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,440
Do you think he is worth Grey Wolf?

765
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,640
Johnny, you're a white man.

766
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,520
Don't let them burn me!
Take me to the fort!

767
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,360
Where did you find him?

768
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,080
The place of the yellow iron.

769
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,000
Who took you there?

770
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,280
- I did.
- You?

771
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,800
Yes, Father.

772
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,840
You took the oath of death.

773
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:30,080
Your own daughter. You'd kill her?

774
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,600
Is she any different
than others of my people?

775
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,240
Very different.

776
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:38,280
Because she is, maybe someday there'll be
a lasting peace between our people.

777
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,680
[Wes screams]

778
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:51,080
The others will not die so easily.

779
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,120
My brother will be avenged.

780
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:57,200
If you burn all those at the fort,
will your brother live again?

781
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,240
Will his spirit be happy
that another war has started?

782
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,720
Yes. We will fight to the end.
My brother's cry is now mine.

783
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,720
- We fight to the end.
- The end of the red man.

784
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,840
The white man armies will stamp you out,

785
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,880
build towns on your hunting grounds,

786
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,480
shoot down those who are left
like animals.

787
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,320
Your words do not frighten me.

788
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:20,240
When you make your war, Red Cloud,

789
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,880
tell me, on which side will our son fight?

790
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,200
I'm sure that someday she'll give me a son.

791
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,800
For this will be the long war.

792
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,360
All of us here will have joined your brother

793
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,240
before peace lives again
between red man and white.

794
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,640
Here they come.

795
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,200
[Man] They're turning off.

796
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,040
They're going away!

797
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,160
- Well, I'll be...
- The Indians are leaving!

798
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,000
