00:00:17,595 --> 00:00:20,137
(STEAM LOCOMOTIVE)

2
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:14,165
Esther! Jane-Marie!

3
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,835
Up and dressed.
Come on out now, ladies.

4
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:20,797
- Train ain't due for a damn week.
- Where's Esther?

5
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:23,508
She's busy. She's got an all-nighter.

6
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,636
Oh.

7
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:37,362
Myrtle! Myrtle!

8
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:38,711
MAN: All right, fall in, fall in.

9
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:41,836
Dress up, Madigan. Dress up.

10
00:04:41,837 --> 00:04:45,008
Murphy, dress 'em up. Come along.

11
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,522
- How long you gonna be?
- 20 minutes, half an hour.

12
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:09,239
Howdy do, ma'am?

13
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,074
You could have a lot of fun
out of me, darlin', if you tried.

14
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:17,917
One thing about me, darlin',
I won't go to hell for not tryin'.

15
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,678
Message from Fort Humboldt
for the governor.

16
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:34,347
I'll take it.

17
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:38,017
It's an army transport train.
No civilians on board.

18
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:47,654
Well, well, well. This is
an odd place to settle.

19
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,572
OK, you heard him,
gentlemen. Line it up.

20
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:54,450
- Major Claremont.
- Sergeant, get me Captain Oakland.

21
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:58,666
Fall out the troops for exercise,
but keep them out of those tents.

22
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:01,707
Yes, sir.

23
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:05,628
Now you listen to me.

24
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:09,090
You will remain hard by this train.

25
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:13,852
You ever see an Indian washing?
They're dirty, and they're ignorant.

26
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,730
Major Claremont.

27
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:28,902
- How long will this take?
- As long as necessary, Governor.

28
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:32,113
This train runs on steam.
That requires water.

29
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:34,699
Let's get it done as
quickly as possible.

30
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,040
Of course.

31
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:39,996
All right, fall in.

32
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:43,049
There will be no skylarking...

33
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:47,045
Bellew said you want to see me.

34
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:50,596
Get your cipher book.
See what you can make of this.

35
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:54,719
- It's for the governor.
- It's from the fort.

36
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,223
Maybe it'll tell us what's going on.
Pissant politicians running an army train!

37
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:01,564
Yes, sir.

38
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:07,523
- (CLATTERING/GUSHING)
- You havin' any problems?

39
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:11,653
No. We're just making sure we're
not gonna have any, Lieutenant.

40
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:15,031
- Newell, come with me a minute.
- For what, Captain?

41
00:07:15,032 --> 00:07:18,783
Major gave me a message from
the fort to be deciphered.

42
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,066
Looks like you've got
room for one more.

43
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:53,695
No civilians, except by special
permission from Washington.

44
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:57,532
I'm a deputy US marshal.
Indian agent for the territory.

45
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,492
The governor can tell ya.

46
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:03,496
My orders are to accept no
unauthorized persons on this train.

47
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:07,166
Dr. Molyneux and the Reverend
Peabody are posted to Fort Humboldt.

48
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,837
The young lady is a daughter
of the commandant at the fort.

49
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:13,590
Why do you want to go to Humboldt?

50
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:17,552
Levi Calhoun. He's in custody
up there. I wanna bring him back.

51
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:21,055
- Well, if ever a man deserved to hang...
- And hang he will.

52
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:24,726
The sooner I can get up there,
the sooner he takes the drop.

53
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:27,228
We can have him sent to
you under armed escort.

54
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:29,772
You said that ain't army business.

55
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:32,743
That way or no way.
Good day, Marshal.

56
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:48,249
Major Claremont.
Locomotive's ready, sir.

57
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,294
- Very well, Sergeant. Carry on.
- Major.

58
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:54,880
I can't find Lieutenant
Newell or Captain Oakland.

59
00:08:57,217 --> 00:09:00,219
Corporal said Humboldt's
only two days up the line.

60
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,012
Something funny's goin' on.

61
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,900
Get the hell off here, son.

62
00:09:12,024 --> 00:09:14,108
Wonder why we ain't movin' yet.

63
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:18,158
You sign up yesterday?
Hurry up and wait. Hurry up and wait.

64
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:21,491
Right, I need eight
volunteers right now.

65
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:25,912
You, you, you two. You.
You, Murphy. You too, Rafferty.

66
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:29,040
Here's what I want you to do.
Go up and scour this town.

67
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:33,086
Captain Oakland and Lieutenant Newell
are missin'. See if you can find 'em.

68
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:35,675
Murphy and I will
take the small tent.

69
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:46,224
Well, have you found them?

70
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:49,561
- Not yet.
- Next time bring a nursemaid.

71
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:54,692
- The train cannot be held any longer.
- You expect me to leave my officers?

72
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,860
I'm very sorry. You know
the urgency of our mission.

73
00:09:57,861 --> 00:10:00,905
Just a goddamn minute!
Just once too often, friend.

74
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:03,958
Put the gun away, friend.
What's your problem?

75
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:08,210
Well, Slippery Fingers
here took $120 off of me.

76
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:12,292
- Maybe he's a good poker player.
- Too good to be true.

77
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:14,881
Looks like a pretty fair hand to me.

78
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:21,009
What's your name?

79
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,052
John Deakin.

80
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:25,393
Stand up.

81
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:29,479
I said stand up.

82
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:37,075
- No gun?
- I'm not a man of violence.

83
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:46,166
What's known as playing
it close to the chest!

84
00:10:47,536 --> 00:10:50,920
That's not good enough,
Marshal. Outside.

85
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:57,295
I'm not a man of violence.

86
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:59,380
(WOMEN SCREAM)

87
00:10:59,381 --> 00:11:01,674
- That's enough.
- Not for me it's not!

88
00:11:01,675 --> 00:11:04,217
Marshal, look at this!

89
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:14,477
"Wanted for theft, gambling
debts, arson and murder."

90
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:20,156
"John Murray, alias John
Deakin, alias Hayes."

91
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:23,238
"Former lecturer at the
University of Iowa."

92
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,615
A lecturer in what, Mr. Deakin?

93
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:31,287
- Medicine.
- You don't expect us to believe that?

94
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:33,623
Here. Listen to this.

95
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:35,625
"Convicted of embezzlement."

96
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:41,881
"Trapped in Lake's Crossing, where he
escaped under cover of a fire that he set."

97
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:46,886
The whole town burned down.
Seven people killed.

98
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:50,521
Seven people. My God,
Richard, that's awful.

99
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:54,018
He blew up a wagonload
of explosives in Sharps.

100
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:56,187
It's still not army business.

101
00:11:56,188 --> 00:11:59,983
Those explosives was on the way
to the presidio in San Francisco.

102
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:02,026
That makes it army business.

103
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:06,076
I'm pretty sure Mr. Deakin here's
gonna be my ticket to Humboldt.

104
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:34,350
So the governor here got hold of
some of his friends in Washington,

105
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:37,771
had me appointed Indian
agent for the territory.

106
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:44,193
More ways to pacify Indians
than shooting holes in 'em.

107
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:48,326
PEABODY: But you did that, too.
In the line of duty, of course.

108
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:52,083
Even back in Ohio,
we knew about Nathan Pearce.

109
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:55,663
- Notorious, was I?
- No. Famous is more like it.

110
00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:58,087
"Famous" is a better word, Marshal.

111
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:01,920
I must admire your spunk, young lady.

112
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:04,839
It's not an easy life out here.

113
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,385
How come you're making this trip if no
civilians are supposed to be aboard?

114
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:13,055
Oh, I have friends in high places.

115
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:17,352
Miss Scoville's joining her father,
at his urgent request.

116
00:13:17,353 --> 00:13:21,147
Gentlemen, I have a
hard day tomorrow.

117
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:23,358
At my age, sleep is a necessity.

118
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:27,193
- "A hard day tomorrow"?
- I have to check the medical supplies.

119
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,907
We're cut off from the world now.

120
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:35,040
May I please just know
what in the hell is going on?

121
00:13:37,873 --> 00:13:42,087
Governor, these are all
intelligent people.

122
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:45,967
I think they have a right to know.

123
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:52,057
Dr. Molyneux here is a specialist.

124
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,309
Your troops are not merely relief. They're
replacements for soldiers who've died.

125
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,020
- Died?
- God save us! The Indians.

126
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:05,233
Not Indians. Fort Humboldt is in
the grip of a diphtheria epidemic.

127
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:06,859
Oh, Richard. My father!

128
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,655
We're in daily contact with the fort,
Marica, and your father's fine.

129
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:12,824
Why wasn't I told?

130
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:16,828
Because we might have lost the rest of
your command, not only two officers.

131
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:20,707
- They must have found out.
- Governor, how dare you expose a lady,

132
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:26,170
- all of us, to this dreadful pestilence?
- We have provisions for a month.

133
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:29,757
We'll remain aboard until Dr. Molyneux
pronounces Humboldt clean.

134
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:33,052
He's got as good a chance as
any of catching the diphtheria.

135
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:36,806
I've already had
the disease. I'm immune.

136
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:39,942
- Where'd you catch it?
- In Mexico. Why?

137
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:42,146
Just curious.

138
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:44,772
How many troops are
available for duty?

139
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:47,113
- Gentlemen.
- Doctor.

140
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:50,862
25 out of a garrison of 76.

141
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:55,291
The others are too sick
for duty, or... dead.

142
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:59,203
- White Hand must like that.
- White Hand?

143
00:14:59,204 --> 00:15:02,873
Paiute chief. He needs watchin'.

144
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:07,295
25 men. That's not even
enough for patrols.

145
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:09,635
If you'll excuse me.

146
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:14,851
Marica. Are you all right?

147
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,764
Yes, of course.

148
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:20,307
It's been a long day.

149
00:15:23,979 --> 00:15:26,522
Are you going to leave
him like this all night?

150
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:29,359
I reckon we could turn him
loose in the morning.

151
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,278
By then we'll be in snow country,
and he'll have no place to go.

152
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:38,033
You sure got a mighty poor
choice for your pity, ma'am.

153
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:42,413
Then you make a mighty poor
example of a lawman, Mr. Pearce.

154
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:44,956
A man is innocent
until proved guilty.

155
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:48,338
But you've tried,
convicted and condemned.

156
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:52,760
Show me the law that says you can
treat a man like a wild animal!

157
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:00,742
You frightened me.

158
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:02,785
I'm sorry.

159
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:05,375
I didn't mean to.

160
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:09,038
Aren't you afraid of
someone seeing you?

161
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:13,053
I'm afraid we're not much
of a secret any more.

162
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,972
- Richard.
- Hm?

163
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:21,848
You should have told me about
the epidemic at the fort.

164
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:23,813
Why?

165
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,643
You'd only have worried.

166
00:17:26,644 --> 00:17:29,187
Or are you afraid I might
have deserted, too?

167
00:17:29,188 --> 00:17:32,572
No. No, I'd never think that.

168
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,416
Let's wait until we
get off the train.

169
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:05,498
Can I get you something?
There's some food left.

170
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:08,411
No, thanks.

171
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:11,544
A drink?

172
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,333
That I'll have.

173
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:49,661
Would you untie my legs?

174
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:51,621
Don't be silly.

175
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:55,421
- I won't go anywhere, I promise.
- I'm sure you won't!

176
00:19:56,085 --> 00:19:59,469
I'm all cramped up and I
need the circulation.

177
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,925
I give you my word.

178
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,520
I'll only untie your legs.

179
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:13,518
And if you want to...

180
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,858
hop off the train,

181
00:20:16,272 --> 00:20:18,611
it's a long hop to anywhere.

182
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:21,241
There. Better?

183
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,994
Give me a hand up?

184
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:30,998
Oh, my God!

185
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:33,705
You promised.

186
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:37,375
When a man is a killer, arsonist,
a cheat and a coward,

187
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:41,377
it's hardly surprising if he
turns out to be a liar as well.

188
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:47,053
- Is your mother still alive?
- Yes. But what's that to do with you?

189
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:50,808
- But she's not well.
- How do <i>you</i> know that?

190
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:56,436
Well, if she were, the commander of
the fort would be visited by his wife,

191
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:58,776
and not his daughter.

192
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:03,524
It's strange, you coming out
here with diphtheria around,

193
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,277
and the Indians on the prod.

194
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:11,492
It must have been an urgent
invitation that brought you.

195
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:15,874
But not by letter. Your invitation
came by telegraph, right?

196
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:22,003
- You gonna marry the governor?
- Now, really! This is quite intolerable.

197
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:24,795
Before you leave, tie my hands again.

198
00:21:25,382 --> 00:21:27,889
Not so tightly.

199
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:32,805
Why all this concern
and interest in me?

200
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:36,225
I should have thought you,
Mr. Deakin, had enough worries.

201
00:21:36,226 --> 00:21:38,151
Yes.

202
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:41,029
I have.

203
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:49,535
Thank you.

Have Ferguson ready with his telegraph
equipment when we stop at 7.00.

00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:12,266
- And get Mr. O'Brien.
- Yes, sir.

- Why are we stopping?
- Morning, Governor.

208
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:20,645
My orders are to contact
the fort daily at this hour.

209

I hope you have, uh, no objection.

210

Make it short, please, Major.

Nice fresh air out here, men.
Everybody outside.

214
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:08,484
Come on, get it out
of there, Bennett.

215
00:23:08,485 --> 00:23:12,572
Guard mounts for everybody. Murphy,
you post guards on the other side.

216
00:23:12,573 --> 00:23:18,286
And you, you, you and you,
up on the top. Keep your eyes open.

217
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:22,665
White Hand's around here somewhere,
men, waiting to pounce on you little boys.

218

So stay awake, stay alert,
and keep your iron unbuckled.

219
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:28,588
I'll be right back.

220
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:32,969
I've gotten through to them, Major,
and they've acknowledged.

221
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,345
My regards to Colonel Scoville,

222
00:23:35,346 --> 00:23:39,643

That's the train, Calhoun.
What do I tell 'em?

00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:02,622
How do I know you won't
pull no fancy tricks?

226
00:24:02,623 --> 00:24:05,165
I swear I never would.

As God is my witness, Calhoun,
I'll see you before a firing squad.

232

Don't you give me
no trouble, Colonel.

Major Claremont.

The epidemic's worsened.

236
00:25:08,355 --> 00:25:12,775
- Is there news of my father?
- It has his signature, so he must be fine.

237
00:25:12,776 --> 00:25:15,320
They're asking about
our time of arrival, sir.

238
00:25:15,321 --> 00:25:17,660

239
00:25:18,699 --> 00:25:22,327
With this weather, I guess we'll
be at Breakheart Pass in about...

240
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:24,667
20 hours.

241
00:25:27,082 --> 00:25:30,209
Transmit that. Add my
compliments to Colonel Scoville.

242
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,547
Then get Myrtle City. Request word on
Captain Oakland and Lieutenant Newell.

Yes, sir.

244
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:48,567
- I can't get Myrtle City, Major.
- Keep trying.

245
00:25:59,073 --> 00:26:01,908
- Dead, sir.
- I don't understand how it could've gone.

246
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:04,702
Weather's been good.
It worked yesterday.

247
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:08,455
- Sergeant Bellew, board the troops!
- Yes, sir.

248
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:12,794
Troopers, fall in. Board the train.

249
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:15,964
Murphy, get 'em aboard.
You be sure you take a roll call.

250
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:18,553
I don't wanna leave anybody behind.

251
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:38,653
- Seen Dr. Molyneux this morning?
- No, not yet.

252
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:42,287
- Shall I send for him, Governor?
- No, it isn't necessary.

253
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:50,588
Dr. Molyneux had better adjust to army
schedules. We don't run a restaurant.

254
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:09,851
Dr. Molyneux.

255
00:27:09,852 --> 00:27:12,607
The governor asked for you, sir.

256
00:27:14,732 --> 00:27:17,071
Dr. Molyneux?

257
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:25,370
It looks like some sort of seizure.

258
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:28,542
Apoplexy, I'd say.

259
00:27:28,662 --> 00:27:31,331
You mind if I have a look?

260
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:35,048
- What the devil for?
- I do know something about medicine.

261
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:37,925
Why not, Major?

262
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:40,597
All right.

263
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:52,393
- The skin's broken above the left ear.
- Of course. He fell.

264
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:55,897
- Died before a bruise could form.
- Apoplexy kills instantly.

265
00:27:55,898 --> 00:28:00,278
No, a seizure like that would turn
the lips and the fingers blue.

266
00:28:02,571 --> 00:28:05,073
It's lucky we have the law aboard.

267
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:07,408
Now, what does that mean?

268
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:11,161
There's a puncture. Right there.
Just below the ribs.

269
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:17,085
Looks like somebody knocked him out,
stuck a surgical probe up under his ribs.

270
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:19,628
God save us.

271
00:28:22,841 --> 00:28:26,842
- It's hard to believe.
- The fact is, we have a killer aboard.

272
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,438
Yes, we have.

273
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:48,366
Move it along, men. Murphy,
keep an eye on that detail.

274
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:50,078
I'll check the drivers.

275

Sergeant, as soon as the engineer is
finished, put the men back on the train.

- We've got to move along.
- Yes, sir.

here, keep a sharp lookout.

all day. Get that wood up there.

somethin' about doctoring.

- Yes, sir. Troopers, fall in.

He certainly wouldn't
have jumped off.

01:10:36,584 --> 01:10:38,923
Don't touch that gun.

504
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,681
Hey, point that thing the other way.
I'm just a working stiff.

505
01:10:45,009 --> 01:10:48,594
The major's just in back.
Bring him over here.

506
01:10:53,976 --> 01:10:56,315
Get down.

507
01:11:00,441 --> 01:11:04,690
- Where's your gun?
- I don't have a gun. I'm just the engineer.

508
01:11:07,448 --> 01:11:09,282
- No! No, no, no!
- Jump!

509
01:11:09,283 --> 01:11:10,994
No!

510
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:15,455
- Where's the gun?
- It's... it's in the box.

511
01:11:15,456 --> 01:11:17,380
Underneath the seat.

512
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:27,717
I don't know who you are,
but the law says...

513
01:11:27,718 --> 01:11:30,390
The law's who I am.

514
01:11:33,933 --> 01:11:36,770
Have a look behind that wood.

515
01:12:07,675 --> 01:12:10,927
They got onto something back
there in Myrtle, and died for it.

516
01:12:10,928 --> 01:12:14,561
Then when Jackson the
fireman spotted the bodies,

517
01:12:14,807 --> 01:12:17,432
Banlon threw him off the train.

518
01:12:18,602 --> 01:12:21,144
Are you gonna listen
to this murderer?

519
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:26,192
I looked at Jackson at the bottom of the
trestle... a head wound with a lot of blood.

520
01:12:26,527 --> 01:12:28,778
A dead man doesn't bleed.

521
01:12:28,779 --> 01:12:32,828
You probably hit him with a
wrench before you threw him off.

522
01:12:34,994 --> 01:12:38,871
Before God, Major, I don't
know what he's talking about.

523
01:12:38,872 --> 01:12:41,498
Major, sir, what do I do?

524
01:12:42,376 --> 01:12:46,756
Keep your gun on Banlon.
If he moves, kill him.

525
01:12:49,592 --> 01:12:53,052
We'll have to crawl forward on
the roof and shoot him out.

526
01:12:53,053 --> 01:12:56,347
What for? He's driving us
right where we wanna go.

527
01:12:56,348 --> 01:12:59,058
Well, let's agree that
Deakin is no idiot.

528
01:12:59,059 --> 01:13:01,601
Why is he taking us there?

529
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:05,522
Well, let's get 'er done.

530
01:13:08,027 --> 01:13:11,654
My job was to arrange
a train. I'm no gunman.

531
01:13:11,655 --> 01:13:14,280
Oh, that's true, O'Brien.

532
01:13:15,075 --> 01:13:19,539
But a noose would fit your neck
just as neatly as it would fit ours.

533
01:13:34,303 --> 01:13:36,477
Hey, sonny boy.

534
01:13:37,264 --> 01:13:40,138
Give me the wrench there.

535
01:13:41,435 --> 01:13:45,270
The nut on the brake handle's loose.
Give me the wrench!

536
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:09,466
You know how to run this thing?

537
01:14:09,838 --> 01:14:12,178
I think so.

538
01:14:34,196 --> 01:14:37,165
You suspected everybody else.
Why not me?

539
01:14:38,993 --> 01:14:41,661
Marshal Pearce was our
number one suspect.

540
01:14:41,662 --> 01:14:44,789
You didn't want him on the train.
That put you in the clear.

541
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:47,875
What's ahead of us at the fort?
What's wrong there?

542
01:14:47,876 --> 01:14:50,378
Calhoun's not in custody.

543
01:14:50,379 --> 01:14:54,173
He's probably with White Hand,
and they're in control of the fort.

544
01:14:54,174 --> 01:14:56,134
My God, what for?

545
01:14:56,135 --> 01:15:01,097
Humboldt's a shipping point for all gold
and silver from California and Nevada.

546
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:05,437
That's why everybody's
involved, except the girl.

547
01:15:05,853 --> 01:15:10,481
The Indians want the rifles
and ammunition back there.

548
01:15:10,482 --> 01:15:14,863
I figure they were gonna put the gold
and silver in the coffins and ship it back.

549
01:15:17,573 --> 01:15:22,202
There's a gun lined up on
you gents. Now stop the train.

- You know anything about dynamite?
- Of course.

564

Set this to blow the rails, but don't
light the fuse until I get back.

they're not, he'll think you crossed him.

- Like hell.

568

- You son of a bitch! What's going on?
- A man's aboard. He's got the engine.

- Right.
