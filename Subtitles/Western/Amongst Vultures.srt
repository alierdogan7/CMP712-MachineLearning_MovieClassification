1
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,245
Don't forget, Martha, the North Ranch
gets their food supplies today.

2
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:42,416
You see that the boys don't leave.
- Don't worry. We'll manage.

3
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,587
I sure hope we'll have better luck
with that damn bear. We've got two more.

4
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:50,215
That old bear's long overdue.
- He's a mean one, isn't he?

5
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,928
Be careful. You yourself told me
when they get old they're vicious.

6
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:59,099
With Bob and Winnetou helping me out,
I should manage. Besides,

7
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:03,270
our friend Old Surehand's arriving.
You should be thinking up...

8
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,439
a special meal.

9
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,572
Martin, will you bring back
a bear for me?

10
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:17,326
But it has to be tiny.
- Well, I'll try to find one...

11
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,495
as small as your nose.

12
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,541
Ma.
- Goodbye, son.

13
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,004
Bye-bye! Goodbye, dear.
- Be careful!

14
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,177
We're grateful to the Chief of the Apaches
that he'll help us hunt the bear.

15
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:44,348
Winnetou has discovered tracks.
- Good. Well, what are we waiting for?

16
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:48,518
Are there any signs?
- Impatience's the privilege of the young.

17
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:53,440
I think Martin wants to be back tomorrow.
Our friend Old Surehand's arriving.

18
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:57,611
He's has always helped the Indian.
Winnetou is also his friend.

19
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,116
The bear's cave is over there.
We must leave the horses here.

20
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,707
We'll get him this time.
- Yep!

21
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,762
That's the fifth one this week.
- Here is his track.

22
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,558
Well, it's no use letting the dogs
get tangled up with him.

23
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,699
Yippie!

24
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,465
Indians, chasing those white men!

25
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,633
They're Schoschones.

26
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,613
Tell me, my friend, do you know this man?
- No.

27
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,908
Them Schoschones
could be on the war path.

28
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:12,412
Winnetou knows they are not.
- But they were chasing those white men.

29
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,583
That is one version. But what was it,
we saw? The evil men chasing the good,

30
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,087
or good men chasing the evil?
- Winnetou's right.

31
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,840
I don't know the answer.

32
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,135
The farm!

33
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,482
Martha!

34
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:37,998
Mother!

35
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,549
No.

36
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,763
I've searched all over.

37
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,233
Look at that! You found this here?

38
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,610
Whose is it?

39
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:10,113
Schoschone. But they are friends
to the white man.

40
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,951
Even the white bandits wouldn't do
a thing like this. Are you trying to say

41
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:19,122
the Indians weren't here?
- My Schoschone brothers did not commit

42
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,291
these murders.
- But you...

43
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,086
You, yourself are an Indian.
You are just out to protect...

44
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:29,424
your stinking, heathen brothers?
- You cannot judge, you're lost in grief.

45
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,221
I'm sure of one thing:
I can see the truth! Get out!

46
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:54,866
Winnetou shall find the killer.
You shall see whether he's Indian...

47
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,826
or white.

48
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,256
Father?

49
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,927
You must eat.

50
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,271
Sally?
- Yeah?

51
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,898
You can clear the table.

52
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,110
Mr. Baumann, someone here to see you.

53
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,326
How do you do? Good afternoon.

54
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,543
I'm sorry to disturb you
in your hour of mourning.

55
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,131
But you see,
I witnessed those murders.

56
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,425
Monstrous crime.

57
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,974
You... can tell me
who those murdering varmints were?

58
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,396
Yes. Indians. But, who they were,

59
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,775
I don't know. Schoschones, I think.
I hid during the attack. When you...

60
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,030
appeared with another Indian, I ran away.
It was terrible. I was too frightened,

61
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:19,326
even though I wanted to help them.
But it was more than I could do.

62
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,662
What's your name?
- Reverend Tobias Barton,

63
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,957
Preacher of the Gospel
of the Holy Saints.

64
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:30,462
What are you doing here?
- I was under the impression...

65
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:35,175
that I would be able to stay here
under this roof, before continuing...

66
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,303
on my way to Llano.
- To Llano, eh?

67
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,431
Yes.
- Where'd you put your horse?

68
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:45,060
I'm a humble man. I'm afraid
I've never been on a horse.

69
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,856
Like our Lord I walk the wilderness.

70
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:58,156
Tell me this, then. How do you explain
that leather patch thereon your britches?

71
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,660
These clothes are just hand-me-downs,
young man.

72
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,829
Let him be, son.

73
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,213
No stranger's ever knocked
on our door in vain.

74
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,613
Where's the Boss?
- Waiting for you inside.

75
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,591
Where've you been? Where are the others?
- We had bad luck.

76
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,304
Weller saw the Baumann men riding off.
- So we went to the farm. - You liars!

77
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,475
No!We thought we can grab a little gold.
- The woman and the kid yelled like pigs.

78
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,104
Yeah, we sure shot them up good.
And the Indians saw us.

79
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,774
And that's when Pinky got shot.
- Where's Weller?

80
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,903
Suddenly he wasn't there.
- We've a job! If they decide to...

81
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,949
follow him, do you know what that means?
- Yeah.

82
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,786
Hey, give me a little cloth.
- No bandages. Don't bother.

83
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,334
Joking, ain't you?
- You'll need more than bandages, Jack,

84
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,714
ignoring my orders.

85
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,837
Stewy!You take six men,
and head off the gold traders,

86
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:22,133
before they reach the Baumann's.
Billy, your men will be keeping an eye...

87
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,429
on the farm to see that the Indians
don't meet up with the Baumann's.

88
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:30,725
And see that no message gets through
to Taylorville. Whoever finds Weller...

89
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,977
flattens him.
- No!

90
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,319
Reports to me
where Weller's hiding out. Got it?

91
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,930
Oh!What time is it now, Wabble?
- Just a bit past three.

92
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:13,643
Old Surehand will show up any time, now.
- I can't sit any longer.

93
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,855
Want to go to gallop? That's faster!

94
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,201
Indians!
- I haven't seen one yet. Don't fool me.

95
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,369
Oh no!

96
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:35,540
Sure. They do bird calls to throw us
off guard. Then they sneak up fast,

97
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,168
and before you know it...
I sure wish Old Surehand was here.

98
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,465
Here I am. Do you want me?
- Boy!

99
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,553
Old Surehand!

100
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:52,181
I must say, you had us worried.
I can take it, yeah.

101
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,895
But she was pretty scared.
- Oh, you were the one who was frightened!

102
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:01,065
You weren't frightened? You were the one!
- Well... Miss Annie, Old Surehand.

103
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,151
Hello.
- Miss Annie.

104
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:08,740
I know your father. When I saw you last,
you were... Well, you were a lot smaller!

105
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,578
Why were you late? What kept you?
- Well, Miss Annie's a mite uneasy,

106
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,206
sitting in a saddle.
- I'm happy to meet famous Old Surehand.

107
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,920
Well... I'm Surehand. I don't know
whether I'm famous. If we want to make...

108
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:26,174
Baumann's ranch by nightfall, we'd better
get going. My horse is over here. Come on!

109
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,260
Alright. Dismount!
- What is it?

110
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,804
Stay low!

111
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,264
Beautiful, Old Surehand! Bravo!
- You see...

112
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,435
why he's called Old Surehand?
Never misses!

113
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,357
Wonderful! It's really...

114
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,651
beautiful.

115
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,239
Take it easy, Miss Annie.

116
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,824
Don't feel bad.

117
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,995
Remember, he'd just seen that Old Indian
shot down, right before his eyes.

118
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,081
And he don't like that.

119
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,636
Hey!Winnetou!
- Winnetou!

120
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,351
A real Indian?
- And a true friend.

121
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:13,573
Winnetou is very glad to see Old Surehand,
as well as his companions.

122
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,785
Surehand and his friends are grateful
that our paths cross.

123
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,959
You old scoundrel! How are you?
- Fine.

124
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,130
Miss Annie, I want you to meet my friend
Winnetou, Chief of all the Apaches.

125
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:33,301
Greatest hunter, friend of the white man,
and a great guy. - Hello.

126
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,929
May Winnetou ask to where
Miss Annie is bound? - To Arizona.

127
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,142
Yeah. I'm taking them to Baumann's farm
to rest up for the night.

128
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,645
His wife and daughter...
His farm was attacked...

129
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,941
while Baumann was away.
- Murdered? Did you hear about that?

130
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,402
No.
- Who did it?

131
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,781
The same men who shot down my friend,
over here.

132
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,872
Who is he?
- Oitka-Peteh, Chief of the Schoschones.

133
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,504
We've got somebody watching us, huh?
- I know.

134
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,593
We've got a visitor.
Don't be frightened.

135
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,098
Alright!
You can come out, now.

136
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,564
You should know you're among friends.

137
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,193
Wokadeh knows that Winnetou
and Old Surehand are his friends.

138
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,906
Who murdered your Chief?
- Some white bandits called The Vultures.

139
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,077
Why were they after you?
- They know that we are the only ones...

140
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,705
who saw The Vultures
raid the Baumann ranch. It was them.

141
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,547
Now, Winnetou. We'll go over to Baumann.
He'll need us. - No.

142
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:57,260
I cannot go there again.
The man is so filled with bitterness.

143
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,888
He believes we committed the murder.
- I'll handle him, huh?

144
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,308
We'll go ahead. You come later.
Alright?

145
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,435
So long.

146
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,859
Come on, Miss Annie. Come on, Wabble.
Let's get going.

147
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,421
Here they come!

148
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,049
Ok, boys. Gold traders. On your horses!

149
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:04,493
I'm Judge Leader from St. Louis.
I'm indeed happy to see you, gentlemen.

150
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,664
My companions and I are looking
for the Baumann ranch. We've been told...

151
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,835
that we could buy some supplies there
before we proceed to Llano.

152
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,006
Baumann's ranch? That's not as near
as you think. We're going to a place...

153
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,676
where we can get much better supplies.
- And may we go with you?

154
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,847
Ah, yes. We was just going there.
Why don't you all come along?

155
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:29,018
I know the boys would sure like it.
With our seven guns and yours...

156
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:33,189
nothing bad could happen.
- Good. Thanks very much. I'll ask them.

157
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:36,817
Do you agree that we should join them?
- Yes, we do.

158
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,740
Boys,
I want you to meet our new friends.

159
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,139
Martin!

160
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:13,312
I'm sorry. We've come at a bad time.
Winnetou told me all about it.

161
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,941
If you hadn't, Dad would be upset.
- Where's your father?

162
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,652
He's right inside.

163
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,364
Hello, Martin.

164
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,950
Wabble.

165
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,495
Sorry. This is Miss Annie Dilman.
- How are you? - Pleased to meet you.

166
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:33,666
We're taking her to Arizona, to her father.
- Words of small comfort...

167
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,461
at a time like this, but I'm truly sorry.
- Thanks.

168
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,222
Baumann, how are you feeling?

169
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,267
No use, I'm afraid.

170
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,521
Know who did it?
- No.

171
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,025
Father thinks it was Indians.

172
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,903
The Preacher there
says he saw the whole thing.

173
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,657
Do you know this man?
- No.

174
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:10,911
Sally, take this young lady
to her room, will you?

175
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:15,374
Mr Baumann! Mr Baumann!
Two Indians are coming towards the house!

176
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,216
Take it easy, Baumann!
These two Indians come in peace.

177
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:28,387
They're not coming on my land!
- Hold it! They come under my protection.

178
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,682
I don't care!
They're not staying on my land!

179
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:36,103
Now, look! They're Winnetou and Wokadeh.
Come on! Give me your gun!

180
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:46,655
Winnetou. You wanted to bring me
the murderers of my wife and child, right?

181
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,284
Well, is that them?
- No. But I bring the body of a warrior.

182
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:55,998
The body of the Chief of the Schoschones.
- What do I care? I didn't kill him.

183
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,417
Baumann, you should care who did.

184
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:03,339
Whoever kills an Indian, is no criminal.
- Listen to what Wokadeh tells you!

185
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:07,635
For only he can say
who the murderers were. Speak, Wokadeh!

186
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:12,181
Wokadeh, along with his father,
saw who killed your woman and child.

187
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,393
The Vulture bandits did it.
- You liars!

188
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,480
Don't, father!
- I know you were the ones who did this.

189
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:24,402
I have a man who can swear to it.
- Who is that man?

190
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:28,864
He's a preacher. A religious man.
And you two managed to murder the one man

191
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:33,035
who was probably trying to help.
- He belonged to The Vultures...

192
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,664
and was shot by me.
- I don't believe a word you're saying.

193
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,959
And as for your dead father,
I spit on him.

194
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:46,090
He is full of grief. He's a sick man.
Wokadeh must try to forgive him.

195
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,718
He cannot dare expect a pardon.
He can only pray...

196
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:53,347
to the sacred spirits.

197
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,851
Trouble?

198
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,521
Wokadeh cannot ignore
the Bear Hunter's insult.

199
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,859
The Schoschones will seek their revenge.
Our friend needs help.

200
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:10,072
You must warn him to be careful.
- Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.

201
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,367
You and l,
we'll catch the murderers, huh?

202
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:23,627
Exactly who is that pretty young girl?
- As I told you, her name is Annie Dilman.

203
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,256
And she's going to her father
in Taylorville to deliver...

204
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,510
a nice wad of cash. He's a gold trader.
- I bet carrying that much gold is heavy.

205
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:35,598
She's a strong girl. It's in the belt
around her stomach. - Wabble.

206
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,394
Don't talk such nonsense.

207
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,025
It wasn't nonsense.
- Perhaps you would like me

208
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,820
to accompany the young lady.
She would be quite safe. - Oh, fine!

209
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,532
You mean go with you and walk
all the way to Llano, right?

210
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:59,079
Well, in all humility, I was daring
to hope for a seat on the wagon.

211
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:03,751
You'd better explain yourself a bit more.
- I work for God, you could say.

212
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:07,922
I was sent out West, a religious guide
to a party of pioneers...

213
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,342
who were bound for Llano.

214
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,595
There's no wagon train near here.
- It's...

215
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:19,308
at Whiteshave River.
- Now, what was that name of yours?

216
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,188
Tobias Barton.
- You're sure?

217
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,735
You know, if you had red hair,
I could swear...

218
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,615
you were a horse thief I once knew,
by the name of Stealing Fox.

219
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:38,285
And where is this man now?
- Last I heard, he was caught.

220
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,248
And you know
what happens to horse thieves?

221
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:47,294
May the Lord show mercy to his soul.
- Amen.

222
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:52,758
It's no use. You ain't never going to get
that dress to fit over that money belt.

223
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:56,929
I've got to fit it on. I promised father
I wouldn't take my money belt off.

224
00:25:57,013 --> 00:26:01,100
Either the dress is going to give up
or the belt's going to give up.

225
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:04,186
The belt's going to give up.

226
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,568
I should at least hide it
under the mattress then.

227
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:24,081
Sally, why is that bell ringing?
- It means the men's work day is done.

228
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,878
And coming up, who's that?
- An officer.

229
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,797
I see that.

230
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,595
I went to a big officer's ball
one night last spring.

231
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,432
It was wonderful!
I danced the whole night!

232
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,186
Is Martin a good dancer?
- He's never had no time for such things.

233
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,856
Martin's nice looking.

234
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,027
We're ordered to clean up a criminal gang
called The Vultures who hideout somewhere

235
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,947
between here and Llano.
- That's good news, I'd say.

236
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,451
In mysterious ways
does the Lord attend us.

237
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:04,622
Now, my little band of pioneers
can cross over to Llano unharmed.

238
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,167
You mean the wagon train
that's going to Arizona?

239
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,546
You've heard of them, my son?
- Colonel Harman has ordered us...

240
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,717
to escort them. And we've been alerted.
My squad's going to Whiteshave River.

241
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,346
I expect you know Miss Dilman.
She's from Taylorville, too.

242
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:25,059
No, Sir. I haven't had that pleasure yet.
I've been only two days...

243
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,687
at the post in Taylorville.
- Are you hungry? You wait!

244
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,357
I'll bring you some chicken.
- Alright.

245
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:36,528
Lieutenant, how about a little something
to wet your whistle? Come and sit down!

246
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:40,491
Well, I wouldn't say no to that!
- How about you, Reverend?

247
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,326
No, no. Never.

248
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,459
How about you? Good for the liver,
and it'll help you sleep a lot better.

249
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,240
It's a local specialty.
Hope you enjoy it.

250
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,991
Thanks.

251
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:28,122
Let's drink to you and your men
and hope that you finish off...

252
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,750
those Vultures real quick.
- I'll drink up to that, alright!

253
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,005
Lieutenant? I hope you can tell me news
of Colonel Harmen's children.

254
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,509
The day before my departure
both girls were ill.

255
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:45,848
They were both outdoors on Wednesday.
Their Mother said they're quite well now.

256
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,642
Thanks so much!

257
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,604
That man's a fake!
The Colonel has no children.

258
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:56,984
Besides, for two weeks he hasn't been
in Taylorville. - Are you certain?

259
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,612
Colonel Harmen's my uncle.
- Just have another drink!

260
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,282
No, I'm on my way.
- Lieutenant?

261
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,747
Are you sure you have men
at Whiteshave River?

262
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,500
What do you mean by that?
- You talk about children who don't exist.

263
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:17,129
Maybe you have men who don't exist.
Now, Miss Dilman says...

264
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,758
Harmen hasn't any children
and isn't in Taylorville.

265
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:26,013
Do you doubt me? As an officer
I demand satisfaction for that!

266
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:30,184
If you're an officer, I'd be happy to...
- Gentlemen!We're in a home of sorrow.

267
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:34,354
Listen you! I wish I had time
to give you what's coming to you!

268
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,983
Well, what's stopping you?
- I have to carry out my orders.

269
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,238
Nothing must delay me. But don't you
forget this: We'll meet again!

270
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,699
Say there!

271
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,453
You weren't thinking of using that, right?
- Oh, no. No.

272
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:54,166
That's only my good luck piece.
- That's a right pretty little toy.

273
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,294
It means a lot to me.
- Where did you get it?

274
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,589
I bought it from a trader
about two years ago.

275
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:05,636
Last time I saw that,
it was in possession of a friend of mine.

276
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,264
Sure! Pistols like that are common place.
- Sure. Sure.

277
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,895
But not with the initials W.B.!
W.B. stands for William Bond.

278
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:19,191
You're a thief, my friend!
- Not only a thief, but a murderer!

279
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:23,362
William Bond vanished a little more
than a year ago up in Llano.

280
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,657
He must be the one who killed him!
- Get away!

281
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,202
Keep your hands up there!

282
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:36,208
No tricks, or you're all finished! See?
- Oh, I wouldn't do that.

283
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:41,547
I know one, though. The idea is
that you've got to pull the trigger fast!

284
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,973
Well, it worked!
For one minute I thought that he had me!

285
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:12,452
I'm very sorry, Miss Annie. I don't like
doing that in front of a lady.

286
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:16,081
This young fellow sure was begging
to get himself killed.

287
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,878
It was him or me.
I had no choice but to shoot.

288
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,883
He's dead.
- Naturally!

289
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:30,095
Did you ever hear of Old Surehand
ever missing? - I'll second that.

290
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,522
Horse thief! I'll get him! Don't worry!
- No.

291
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:44,151
No, no. We have that horse
from the phoney officer.

292
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,905
Hey! He left his Bible here!
- He won't miss it.

293
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:52,326
But I've got a note he'll miss.
That man slipped it to him in the Bible.

294
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:59,291
Hey! Come and listen to this:
The Boss wants me to ride with the train.

295
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:03,462
Report back to the hideout.
- That's as phoney as a three dollar bill.

296
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:07,633
They'll lead them folks into some trap.
- That's a long ride to Whiteshave River.

297
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:12,137
If we're to help those people,
we've got to do some thinking.

298
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:16,558
Hey!That's my pal!
That's the old Baumann again!

299
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,976
Come on.

300
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,878
Go on in! Go on!
Look who's here, Boss!

301
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:49,299
Hey, look at that pretty coat!
Hey, does it fit you nice?

302
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:54,554
So you're back. It's about time, you rat!
- It wasn't my fault,

303
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,725
no matter what Fred and Joe say.
Let me see them! I can prove it!

304
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,020
I'm afraid that's not possible.
- But then...

305
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,024
You may be seeing them somewhere else!

306
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:10,195
You should be grateful to me! I told
the Baumann's their farm was attacked...

307
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,198
by Indians. That's all I could do!

308
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,242
Where's Tom?

309
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,706
Speak up, you louse!

310
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,459
He's dead.

311
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:29,589
Tell me who did it.
- Old Surehand.

312
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,386
Tom should have known.
He drew on him.

313
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,391
Old Surehand!

314
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,686
You can't out, draw that one!
- What do we do?

315
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:48,692
What do you mean? Tomorrow you're
at Whiteshave River with the settlers.

316
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:53,447
Both, Stewy and Rod will back you up.
You lead them around the plant of Sierra

317
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:57,617
and divert the whole treck South.
By the next night you should be in Llano.

318
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,246
Put up for the night there.
We'll wait here at White Rock.

319
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,959
Signal me when the time's right.
- Just a minute.

320
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:10,172
Let me tell you some news.
- Tell me. Go ahead.

321
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:16,053
You know who's staying at Baumann's? Boy!
A beautiful girl... with a money belt.

322
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,265
I bet she'd drop it, if we tickled her!

323
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,953
Is the Chief of the Apaches permitted
to interrupt the Schoschones' meeting?

324
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:46,124
The Chief of the Apaches is welcomed
by the Schoschones at any time.

325
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:50,295
What does my brother wish?
- Wokadeh and the elders seek vengeance.

326
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:54,466
The spirits of all my ancestors are
awaiting their vengeance. We shall...

327
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:58,637
uphold our honour when Manitou approves.
- But it can bring war, Wokadeh.

328
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:02,808
Do you propose to start it?
To have all our people shed their blood?

329
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:08,188
True peace can't exist between white men
and us as long as the Bear Hunter lives.

330
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,610
Do you want revenge, Wokadeh?
Then do as I say.

331
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:18,448
Let me ride out until I catch that gang
and you can do far more...

332
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:23,120
to avenge the murder of your Chief.
- Say they're not found? Then what?

333
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,414
Then I shall bring back proof.
I'll return...

334
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,502
when the moon is full, to my friend.

335
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,052
Good fortune attend you.

336
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,742
They could have taken me along.
I can shoot. I'd be a help.

337
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:07,455
That's only for the big girls.
- Don't you think I'm a big girl?

338
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:13,170
That Vulture gang isn't playing.
You just stick around.

339
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:17,340
Why do men think women are helpless?
I'm a great shot!

340
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:28,393
That wasn't it. I wanted to hit...

341
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,730
the other one over there.
- Oh, I see.

342
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,486
Where are you going?
Don't you have anything I can do?

343
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:42,032
Yeah. Go and help Sally darn socks!
- Men!

344
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,003
Help!

345
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,172
Come on!
- Here we go.

346
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:07,390
Quiet down!
- Oh no! Help!

347
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,516
Martin!

348
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,903
Untie the horse! Quick!

349
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,117
Come on!
-Let me go!

350
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,248
Let go, you idiots! Let go!

351
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,423
Take your hands off that girl!

352
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:28,972
You should know how to treat a lady.
Betsy, show her up to her room.

353
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,059
I'm going to the ranch
you kidnapped me from.

354
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,565
You'll get back if you play along with me.
- Come upstairs. You'll be safer there.

355
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,893
You boys behave yourselves.
We've got to act charming.

356
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:27,655
Now, please get out of this room!
- I'll remember the next time.

357
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:31,284
Meanwhile, where's the cash?
- What do you mean, huh?

358
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,453
Take a look!

359
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:38,249
Betsy!
- Hands off, huh?

360
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,674
I think you boys
had better search her. Go on!

361
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,355
Hands up!

362
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,826
Now, get out!

363
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,121
Do you prefer to go on?

364
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:20,291
Don't fool yourself. There's only
one thing that will get you out of here:

365
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,503
the money.
So, you just think it over.

366
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:30,176
She's a wild cat!
- I thought you said she was a lady!

367
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:34,889
Barry, I want you and Jude to ride down
and get the gunpowder. But, hurry.

368
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:39,060
Be back by nightfall when Stewy
gets here with the gold traders.

369
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:43,231
Mick? The girl has a gun. Stay outside.
Keep an eye on her window. But, watch out.

370
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:47,360
She's a pretty good shot.
- Don't worry.

371
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,075
Hi.

372
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,120
Good day.

373
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:49,297
I'm a stranger. Can you help me?
- Go ahead. What is it?

374
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:53,092
Well, I met a man who said
I might sell horses around here.

375
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:57,805
What man was that? Who sent you here?
- A fellow I bumped into at Llano.

376
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,976
Tall, with black hair. But this man
knew a particular kind of buyer...

377
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:06,147
who was what I was looking for.
So, if any of you gentlemen...

378
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,776
are interested...
- You can peddle horses anywhere.

379
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,406
Yeah.
But mine are kind of special horses.

380
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,869
The brands, after all,
are not too clear.

381
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:24,374
Did you bring them with you?
- Do you think I'm crazy?

382
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,087
I'll bring them around in a day or two.
I tie them outside. You'd just untie them.

383
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:32,173
But they're not free!

384
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:38,096
My black-haired friend told me you...
If you like a horse trader like me...

385
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:43,893
if you and the boys would consider having
me as part of your group... Because...

386
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,980
This group is The Vultures?

387
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,568
Mister, you sure are mighty shrew.

388
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:55,572
Yeah. I guess I am.
- Besides stolen horses, what's your game?

389
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,373
Anything else to show me?

390
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,126
Well, not right away.

391
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:16,092
First I'm going to buy all of you
to seal the bargain, right?

392
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,397
Alright! Stop it! Now, cut it out!

393
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:53,087
I'd say that someone didn't hear
your order to cut out that shooting.

394
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,674
Who's in that room, Boss?
- Boss! Boss!

395
00:43:56,759 --> 00:44:00,845
That girl's gone crazy! She's taking
pot-shots at me out of the window.

396
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:05,016
She's driving me out of my mind!
- Who wanted you to use your stupid mind?

397
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,685
I just said, "Hold up outside"!

398
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,591
Stop that! Get back to your post!

399
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,762
Let me have one!

400
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,557
Give me a half.

401
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,939
He's not only a good shot,
he knows his poker!

402
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,150
I'm going to christen him Poker Face!

403
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:04,367
Why not call him by his real name:
Martin Baumann!

404
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,376
You sure of that, now?
- Positive.

405
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,547
I saw him at the farm with the girl.

406
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,217
Well, what do you know?

407
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,431
The son of the Bear Hunter, huh?

408
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:30,893
You won a medal.
- You miss your sweetie, I guess?

409
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:39,902
Stay right where you are, Poker Face.
- I'll just take your gun, Baumann.

410
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,197
I wouldn't want you
to get in any trouble.

411
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,357
String him up, the liar!Take him out!

412
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:24,530
I'm afraid we've arrived here
in the middle of trouble.

413
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,662
Now, what's he done?
- He's a horse thief.

414
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:35,917
One of the Vulture gang.
We just caught him before you arrived.

415
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,589
And these fellows?
- I happen to be a prospector.

416
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,927
George Preston, Sir. And these are
my workers... and they're honest ones.

417
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,431
Have you heard this gentleman accuse you
of being a horse thief?

418
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,897
Listen, boy. You're talking to a judge.
I'm trying to help you.

419
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,526
I'm Judge Leader from St. Louis.
- Don't move!

420
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,031
Stay away from there.

421
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,542
Hello.
- Hi!

422
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,338
So, you've been begging for trouble!

423
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,557
Quiet, everybody! Quiet down, please!

424
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:36,143
There's no defence against thieving
you can offer.

425
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:40,356
I had to come inside here. So I said
I was a horse thief. Then they found out

426
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,442
just who I really was.

427
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:48,906
The Vulture gang? There they are.
- Don't believe that, Sir. He's lying.

428
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,910
Quiet! Silence! I said silence! Now!

429
00:47:56,665 --> 00:48:00,751
I'm sorry. That's an extremely
flimsy story. Who would believe it?

430
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:04,422
There's a very severe penalty
for horse thieves like you.

431
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:11,012
Gentlemen, let's go!

432
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,239
Martin!
- Come on!

433
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,377
Hey! Hey!

434
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,475
Hey! Come on! Hey!

435
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:53,322
Winnetou must go. You must warn
your father to beware of the Schoschones.

436
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,826
They want his death.
Winnetou seeks the murderer.

437
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,246
Come.

438
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,616
What's the matter?

439
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,201
Indians.
- Where?

440
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,747
I don't know.
But, maybe I can spot them.

441
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:59,805
Alright. I'll go ahead.
Don't any of you move now. Don't forget.

442
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,016
You're in charge.
- Ok.

443
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,572
Surehand's going to be so mad.

444
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:43,075
What happened?
- Baumann was took by the Indians.

445
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,871
Well, what the devil were you doing?
- Just standing.

446
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,499
Where are your guns?
- Well...

447
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,379
Come on!

448
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:59,592
You wait, I get you. You'll be sorry.

449
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:14,583
Winnetou did not return.
I went out to find the old Bear Hunter.

450
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:17,419
Manitou wills it so.

451
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:23,342
Did Wokadeh capture the other men?
- No. His friends followed.

452
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:26,011
Our arrows are ready.

453
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,440
Hey.

454
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:46,699
Hey, hey. Look.
- Isn't that Winnetou?

455
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:51,370
We're in luck.
Winnetou's the only one that can help us.

456
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:01,755
Winnetou hails the new Chief
of the Schoschones.

457
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,066
You! Stay here!

458
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,589
It seems the Chief of the Apaches
has second sight, huh?

459
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:47,801
Winnetou knew Old Surehand would try
to free our friend from the Schoschones.

460
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:51,430
You will help me, Winnetou?
- Wokadeh still feels

461
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:55,601
the Bear Hunter should atone.
- I know that. It's no reason for him

462
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:59,229
to be killed for it, though.
- Old Surehand has courage.

463
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:03,525
But planning is the one way to do this.
The moon tonight shines brightly.

464
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:08,113
Then the death watch begins,
and Old Surehand can free his friend.

465
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,699
Good idea.

466
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,767
Did you coyotes decide
how to kill me yet, huh?

467
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:44,024
That's not asking too much, is it?

468
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,866
I mean, a fellow has a right to know
if he's going to be burned or scalped...

469
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:56,078
or whatever else you have in mind.

470
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,003
I'll come back.

471
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,277
There he is.

472
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:38,328
Take it easy, there.
- Chief of the Apaches. Why are you here?

473
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:41,957
I told Old Surehand
just how to get to Wokadeh's tent.

474
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:46,128
Winnetou admires the white man
more than his brothers.

475
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:50,841
Winnetou admires justice. For Old Surehand
merely wishes to ask the Schoschone elders

476
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,470
to stop doing harm.
You have the power to arrange everything.

477
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:58,640
He should be honoured by Wokadeh,
not hunted by your men.

478
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,146
What do you plan to do?

479
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,400
Wokadeh shall not make his decision
as a prisoner.

480
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,949
The pale face shall be my guest.

481
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,164
Come on!

482
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:27,336
Now then, what do we do?
- Don't you know? - We get him out!

483
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,507
Just how are we going to do that
without any guns, you nitwit?

484
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:39,223
Surehand understands Wokadeh's feelings
about the death of his father,

485
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,893
the great Chief. But, we too,
wish to avenge the death

486
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:46,605
of our two white sisters.
Will the brave young warriors...

487
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:51,318
of the Schoschones give us their help?
- It is too late to save the Bear Hunter.

488
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:54,613
I'm sorry
if Old Surehand is disappointed.

489
00:58:55,031 --> 00:59:00,160
Wokadeh's revenge for the insult
that Baumann gave to his dead father...

490
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:04,081
can come later. Will you help us?

491
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,967
They fear their prisoner will be rescued
after the warriors leave.

492
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,640
Do the old warriors wish to insult me?

493
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:26,520
I gave my word. Winnetou tells you
his brother is a fair man.

494
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,550
Wabble!

495
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:02,139
You speak hereof peace!
And you try to fool me!Your men...

496
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:06,393
come to attack!The pale face's tongue
is split like that of a serpent.

497
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:09,688
Wokadeh!
- No! Wokadeh casts out Winnetou!

498
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:14,192
We are no longer brothers! Winnetou lies,
just like the pale face.

499
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:18,363
Winnetou spoke the truth.
The white men thought I was in danger.

500
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:21,450
Too bad for them!
- Alright.

501
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,912
It's for Wokadeh to make a decision.

502
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,753
My life is in Wokadeh's hands.

503
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,845
Manitou shall decide. In our tribe
there are three great marksmen.

504
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:46,016
And each shall shoot an arrow at you,
at will. If you can stop the arrow...

505
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,102
with a bullet, you are free.

506
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:52,439
I accept Manitou's justice.
- And bear in mind,

507
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:56,068
if you hit the warrior
and not his arrow, you will die.

508
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:08,205
You are sending him to his death.
Won't you hear more?

509
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:12,084
The man's our friend.
- Not mine, though.

510
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,339
It was my responsibility.
Let me take his place.

511
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,260
Winnetou, my friend...
This is my affair.

512
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:02,045
Winnetou should have known that his friend
Old Surehand would always hit the mark.

513
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:05,257
But the second one
sure tickled my ribs!Wow!

514
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:10,387
Manitou has spoken. Old Surehand
did not lie. He is at liberty.

515
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:12,973
And we will follow you.

516
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:16,476
Take care of the others, will you?
- Oh, we will.

517
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:20,647
And give Old Wabble a drink.
He sure needs one!

518
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:50,510
We're coming to the Valley of Death.
There are Indian guards...

519
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:54,139
all over the place.
If we don't take this short cut,

520
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:57,183
we'll miss the wagon train.

521
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:49,254
End of the trail, eh?
- You rescue so many girls.

522
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:53,967
Sorry, you weren't satisfied.
- I'm going to miss you!

523
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:21,703
You're packing. Are you getting ready?
- Yes, that's right.

524
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:26,416
My name's Martin Baumann.
I'm looking for my father and his friends.

525
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,587
I was wondering if they were around here.
- Oh, sure, sure. They got here today.

526
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:34,758
They're the ones that'll be guiding us.
- Let me give you a hand. - Thank you.

527
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:38,928
Howdy. Can you tell me where I can find
the men who arrived today?

528
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:42,015
Yeah. Right there.
- Thanks.

529
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,150
Hey!The horse thief!

530
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:57,781
They're not the friends
you're looking for, are they?

531
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:04,454
I'm getting mighty tired of them names!
If you want my identity,

532
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:07,665
just ask the Preacher here.
- l?

533
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:12,170
You say I'm to know?
I never met you before.

534
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,718
How dare you strike this God fearing man!

535
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:23,765
God fearing man? You're mistaken...
- This time you won't escape.

536
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:27,936
Right! He won't be getting away this time.
- You're guilty of horse thieving, and now

537
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:32,107
you do this! I feel I should punish you
according to the law of the people.

538
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:36,361
You can't order the rope for me!
- That's what we do to horse thieves!

539
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:44,452
Mother! Mother!They're going to hang him!
They say he's a horse thief!

540
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:47,205
You sure?
- Yes! I was there!

541
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,418
Stop!

542
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,798
Stop!What do you think you're doing?

543
01:08:57,716 --> 01:09:01,261
Do you think that by hanging
an innocent man you're all safe?

544
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:03,972
My, my!Who is that girl?

545
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:09,644
What's the matter? Afraid to run away?
Has this fake convinced you,

546
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:13,815
Martin deserved that fate?
- No. It was I. Judge George Leader.

547
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:17,986
Your judgment's as false as he is.
To the innocent you offer hanging.

548
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:22,157
And the criminals you let off!
- Didn't your mother teach you respect...

549
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:26,327
for a man of the cloth?
- When you learn the facts I wonder...

550
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:30,498
how much respect you'll show!
He is not a preacher, he's a criminal!

551
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:34,127
Oh Lord, protect this young girl
from the sin of falsehood,

552
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:38,840
for she knows not what she's doing.
You've mistaken me for someone else, dear.

553
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:42,468
I wouldn't forget you.
You ran away from the Baumann ranch.

554
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:46,639
Baumann's ranch? l?
- You ran off in such a hurry...

555
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:50,310
that you forgot your bible!
- I have my bible.

556
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:53,396
Oh? Then bring it out!

557
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,193
Where is it? I put it inside...

558
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:02,822
Disappeared, has it, he says!
- If it fell out of my pocket...

559
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:06,993
I'm going to look for it. Excuse me.
- What are you here for? Why interfere?

560
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:10,496
Only because I wouldn't hang a man
who's innocent.

561
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:15,335
My father in Arizona is proud of me.
- I apologize. I know no one in Arizona.

562
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:18,963
Now, listen! I'm telling you,
that young man over there...

563
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:23,218
is not a horse thief. And that Preacher
is a fake. Well, who do you believe now?

564
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:28,723
Wagon Master Howard, what do we do?

565
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:33,269
I don't know.

566
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:40,652
Might be the chance of an injustice.
If the boy's dead, you can't correct him.

567
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:12,976
It may be the last time we do it.
But let's take them under guard,

568
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:17,188
and the courts can decide when we get them
both to Arizona. - Very good idea.

569
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:21,442
I'll take the boy along in my wagon
and keep an eye on him. - Very well.

570
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:25,655
I wonder if you two would follow up
that suggestion and keep your eye...

571
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,324
on the Reverend, will you?
- Sure thing.

572
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:33,454
Come on, boy! Come along! Come on, folks!
Into your wagons. We're moving.

573
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,131
I...

574
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:07,030
Go on! Go home!

575
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:44,901
Old Surehand! Hey, look!

576
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:49,614
Hello there, buddy.
- What are you doing here? Who are you?

577
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:54,327
You can just put that over there.
This is our friend, Old Surehand.

578
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:57,455
You mean the famous Surehand?
- Yes.

579
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:01,626
It's a pleasure. Where are you taking
your wagon train? - Arizona.

580
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:05,254
Oh, no, sir. You're going
to be ambushed, right at Llano.

581
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:09,425
How do you know that?
How do you know this young man here?

582
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:14,138
Him? He's the son of my old friend,
Baumann. I knew him before he was dry...

583
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:18,309
behind the ears. I wouldn't trust
those men up there because they're going

584
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:22,480
to lead you right to their gang.
- That's a fine trick. And now?

585
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:26,109
Can I rely on your help?
- Sure. On our friends, too.

586
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:29,862
Count me in. I'd like to help.

587
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:35,243
Miss Annie! I'd forgotten all about you!
Gentlemen, we have nothing to worry about!

588
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,288
Come over!

589
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:14,615
The men who defiled these holy graves are
the ones who are guilty of the murders.

590
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,786
Trust in me. You're my brother.
Those are the men that we want.

591
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:24,000
Winnetou swears by the spirit
of your dead father to seek out...

592
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:27,628
these treacherous men
and bring them to Manitou's justice.

593
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:31,382
Manitou gives true words to the Apache.

594
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:40,766
Hand those men their weapons!

595
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,065
And Baumann?

596
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:16,677
He'll stay. Prepare the graveyard!
Manitou now orders us to battle...

597
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:20,932
against the enemies of our people.
Winnetou needs our force.

598
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:50,169
Let's go!

599
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:59,929
Now, did you get all that?
You ride to White Rock and tell Preston...

600
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:03,224
that we strike tonight.
- Why me? Let Rod go.

601
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:07,478
Nothing doing. The Boss wants it this way.
Anyway, Rod's sleeping. Get going!

602
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:11,357
Oh, I get all the dirty work!

603
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:34,213
Hello?

604
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:39,885
Well, well. A pretty girl's always welcome
in my wagon! Come on in!

605
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:44,348
No. Why don't you come out?

606
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,743
Were you asleep?
- Yeah. What is it?

607
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:07,788
Do you want to see something? - Sure.
Come on!

608
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:21,177
Help! Help! Murderers!

609
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:24,680
They're trying to attack!
- Hey, come back here!

610
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:30,895
I'd like to know what's going on!

611
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:35,274
Threatening a Reverend!
I don't understand that!Who are you, sir?

612
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:40,154
My name Surehand.

613
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:46,827
This so called Preacher and those two men
belong to a gang that are going to lead

614
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:50,456
your wagon train into an ambush.
- You're sure of the facts?

615
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:54,502
Yeah, I'm sure.
- Judge! Judge, don't believe him!

616
01:17:55,212 --> 01:18:00,049
Don't listen to a word!
He's a rotten liar! Ask him! Ask him!

617
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:02,510
Shh. You'll wake him.

618
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:08,724
Come here.
- Every word's a lie!

619
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:12,019
He belongs to The Vultures!
- Alright! Move!

620
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:15,564
Well, now.

621
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:21,195
Tell us who this man is.
- This is...

622
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:23,989
Mr Stewart.

623
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,784
Professional guide.

624
01:18:27,577 --> 01:18:31,664
You sanctimonious parson!You tell the man
the truth here before I count to three,

625
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:35,292
or I'll shoot you through the head!
- No! For my sake! Don't!

626
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:39,380
One...
- I...

627
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:43,134
two...

628
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:48,264
He blackmails him into a false statement.
Don't let him get away with that.

629
01:18:56,314 --> 01:19:00,109
No! No! Don't shoot!
I'm going to tell everything!

630
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:02,278
Only don't fire!

631
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:08,659
You were right. The Vultures are waiting
over at Llano. They want to ambush...

632
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:12,163
the train tonight.
They're going to do it tonight!

633
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:19,253
Murderers! I've a good mind
to forget justice and do to you

634
01:19:19,337 --> 01:19:23,507
what you've done to us!
You're to blame for whatever happens!

635
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:27,303
We've got to plan things.

636
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:32,099
We have a plan.
- You want to take him? Go on!

637
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:35,770
Take him, Judge.
- Alright, you! Here, get him out!

638
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,900
Upsi-daisy! There.

639
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,696
Our friend Weller here has an appointment
with the Chief of the gang. He's going...

640
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:49,867
to tell them that it's safe to attack
the wagon train tonight, aren't you?

641
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:54,038
But he's not going to tell them that.
He's going to tell them...

642
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:57,958
it's safe to attack at dawn. No?
- One moment.

643
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:02,379
What's the difference if it's tonight,
or if it's at dawn, Surehand?

644
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,591
With so few men,
how can we withstand...

645
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:10,179
There's more, you see. My friend Winnetou
has promised that he'd meet us at Llano

646
01:20:10,263 --> 01:20:14,433
at dawn with all of the Schoschone.
Then we have nothing to worry about.

647
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:19,188
Hey, Weller, come on!

648
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:25,027
Martin!Thank goodness
I didn't let you hang.

649
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:30,115
You said it!

650
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:50,678
Now, we...
know what we're gonna do,

651
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:54,181
don't we?
- Yeah.

652
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:58,769
Just so that we're sure, you tell me.

653
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:03,858
Well, I tell Preston
that he's not to attack until morning

654
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:08,153
because the trains are very heavily armed
and crawling with soldiers.

655
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:12,741
But when it's dawn the soldiers will be
Leaving the train, and that's when I'll

656
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:14,910
give him the go-ahead.

657
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:16,745
And?

658
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:18,873
And...

659
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:24,336
If I change a word, then you'll shoot me.
- That's good.

660
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:27,506
Really very good.

661
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:29,633
Go!

662
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:38,392
You won't forget, will you?

663
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:40,686
No, no, no. Not a word.

664
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:05,461
Don't worry. It's only Weller.

665
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:12,051
Where's your horse, Weller?
Why come here on foot?

666
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,804
I want to talk to you!
If I took my horse away, they'd...

667
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:19,558
He shits himself again!
- Can we attack?

668
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:24,146
Is tonight's raid safe?
- It's all off for tonight!

669
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:27,483
Nothing you can do.
The cavalry's with them.

670
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:31,612
They're leaving at dawn.
The settlers are armed.

671
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:35,699
Tonight I'll destroy their weapons.
Better start moving tomorrow.

672
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:40,704
Don't make a move tonight!
- Sounds kind of strange. He's gone loco.

673
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:45,876
Why the devil don't you come close?
I'm sick of yelling!

674
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:49,505
No, I have to get back.
They'll be getting suspicious.

675
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:55,469
He's batty!
- Oh, well.

676
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:59,098
At least we can depend on Stewy
to know what he's doing.

677
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:02,851
We'll attack in the morning, then.
Go on, turn in now.

678
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:14,738
Very good. Word perfect.
I'm proud of you!

679
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:23,789
This way.
- Sure.

680
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:44,768
Hey!

681
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,567
Hey, Martin! Here's your father!

682
01:23:52,402 --> 01:23:53,444
Father!

683
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:58,532
Wabble! You old son of a gun!

684
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:03,370
You're kind of late getting here!
- I'm glad that I'm here, anyway!

685
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:07,374
Hey there, Jimmy! Where's Winnetou?
I see you made it!

686
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:11,045
He'll get here soon.
How about The Vultures? Any trouble yet?

687
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:15,215
Nothing but trouble! Do you want to take up
the rear? Make sure they keep up close.

688
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,010
I'll take the wagon.

689
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:20,971
Hello, Miss Annie!

690
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:24,183
Come on, you little shrimp! Up you go!

691
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:32,483
I don't want to help you out of a mess
like that again!You'd get yourself

692
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:35,360
captured by ants if I weren't around.

693
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:39,073
Oh!We're hunting for bandits, eh?
Listen.

694
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,368
If there's any difficulty out,
how about it, eh?

695
01:24:43,536 --> 01:24:46,663
You couldn't hit a house. A big one.

696
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:28,956
Hold it!

697
01:25:35,421 --> 01:25:39,216
I don't see them. Are they in the wagon?
- I told them to ride.

698
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:42,803
Seems to me this job
isn't going at all the way I'd like.

699
01:25:43,429 --> 01:25:47,516
They might have caught Weller tonight.
- We should take a chance.

700
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,687
I don't like that ring they're making.
- There's nothing we can do about it.

701
01:25:51,771 --> 01:25:55,315
They form that ring,
and it'll be too bad. Let's go!

702
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,737
Circle in! Circle in!

703
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,995
Put the horses in the middle! Hurry!
Halt!Turn wagon! Halt!

704
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:21,717
Alright. Now, close up, everybody!
- Get that wagon over here!

705
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:25,888
Now, bring the horses! In the middle!
- Unharness those horses! Come on!

706
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:30,309
Move them inside!
- Tell the men to get underneath!

707
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:37,691
Get ready! They're coming!
- They're coming! Ok, now! Good luck!

708
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:18,065
Hey! Come back! Come back, boy!

709
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:19,691
Come back!

710
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:28,825
What do you think you're doing, huh?
Go on!

711
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:32,829
Mr Baker! I'm coming to help!

712
01:27:41,172 --> 01:27:43,257
Just wait! I'll get one!

713
01:27:56,729 --> 01:28:00,190
Yippee!Three! I got three!

714
01:28:15,915 --> 01:28:18,000
Polish them off, fast!

715
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:14,306
Come on! Stay back!
Get under cover!

716
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:18,477
You told us Winnetou would come here
with the Schoschones by now.

717
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:22,898
We cannot hold out any longer.
You've got to get these people out!

718
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:29,029
No matter what happens,
get them through this.

719
01:29:29,113 --> 01:29:32,282
Promise to... Promise me that...

720
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,472
Indians! Get going!

721
01:30:04,607 --> 01:30:06,691
Come on, Winnetou!

722
01:30:19,038 --> 01:30:21,248
Boy!Are we glad to see you!
- Old Surehand!

723
01:30:21,332 --> 01:30:22,374
Winnetou!

724
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:30,173
Come on!This way.

725
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,765
Weller! Get out of here!
- Go on! Scram!

726
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:08,378
Well, Baumann,
who's winning the game now?

727
01:31:09,505 --> 01:31:13,049
It's not over. See?
- Go and get Surehand. Take him away.

728
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:16,011
Preacher, you're lucky.
- Go on!

729
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,560
Old Surehand!
- What now?

730
01:31:26,522 --> 01:31:30,609
We're holding Martin Baumann.
If you want him back alive,

731
01:31:31,277 --> 01:31:33,778
come and get him. Alone!

732
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:38,909
He's my boy, and I'll go and get him.
- You stay here!You heard what they said.

733
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:43,079
If you go over there, they'll kill him.
It's me they're after.

734
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:47,792
Not alone. Winnetou shall go with you.
- I want you to stay here.

735
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,670
Here.

736
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:56,259
Please, Old Surehand. Please.
- You're kind of fond of him, Miss Annie.

737
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:58,803
I'll bring him back.

738
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:05,769
He'll be here.

739
01:32:06,145 --> 01:32:10,315
I warn you. Make a sound,
and you'll get a bullet through the head.

740
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:19,741
Surehand!

741
01:32:35,174 --> 01:32:39,803
Come out, Surehand! Because, if you don't,
we're going to kill him.

742
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:45,976
Come out!

743
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:50,021
Here I am.

744
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:56,778
Hold it!

745
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:03,785
Now, gentlemen,

746
01:33:05,496 --> 01:33:09,040
put your guns away. Nice and slow.

747
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:13,670
Very good.

748
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,339
Now, raise your hands.

749
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:21,052
Turn around, real easy.

750
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:35,233
When you're ready.

751
01:34:20,613 --> 01:34:21,655
Martin!

752
01:34:22,698 --> 01:34:23,740
Alright.

753
01:34:27,244 --> 01:34:28,286
Martin!

754
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:34,250
Surehand! Drop your gun.
I'm not joking. If you don't,

755
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:38,380
he'll be killed. Drop that rifle.

756
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:41,675
Don't do it, Surehand! Shoot!

757
01:34:43,552 --> 01:34:44,594
No.

758
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:47,722
No, maybe he's not joking.

759
01:34:52,728 --> 01:34:56,398
Come closer. A little bit nearer.

760
01:34:57,566 --> 01:34:59,109
Keep walking.

761
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:02,821
I want you to see his face
when he gets it.

762
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:23,967
Where is he?
- He's alright. There.

763
01:35:25,511 --> 01:35:27,721
Oh, that kid!Thanks.

764
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:32,016
Martin!

765
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:39,274
Winnetou has brought the killer
of your family to you, as he promised.

766
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:42,861
There, on the ground.
- You mean, this man?

767
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:45,196
Yes.

768
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:54,956
His name's Stealing Fox.

769
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:02,547
To hide from the law, he always wore this.

770
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:07,886
Because of his name.

771
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:14,142
Proof is in your son's hands, Bear Hunter.

772
01:36:18,814 --> 01:36:20,356
Her ring.

773
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:26,404
Will that make you admit it?

774
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:29,991
That the Indians did not do it.
- Yeah.

775
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:34,788
Now hatred can be put aside.
We can all be friends again.

776
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:39,167
When I'm not afraid of you.
When you're not afraid of me.

777
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:56,935
Hey!That was one lovely shot.

778
01:36:57,478 --> 01:37:01,105
I learned from you, Professor.
- That thing really works? I thought,

779
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:05,777
you used it just to impress people.
- Why, you can hit someone over the head.

780
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,404
You said it! Come on!

781
01:37:09,532 --> 01:37:13,618
Be seeing you, Baumann. Take it easy.
My regards to your father.

782
01:37:13,702 --> 01:37:17,789
Thank you. I'm going to tell him
the Baumann ranch needs a woman around.

783
01:37:17,873 --> 01:37:21,000
And I know just the one!
- You, huh?

784
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:24,587
Good luck!
- Well, let's go, folks.

785
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:26,548
Goodbye.

786
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:36,224
We must say farewell again.

787
01:37:36,517 --> 01:37:40,186
Winnetou has seen his friend,
Old Surehand, and he is glad.

788
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:43,481
Peace, my old friend,
until we meet next time.

789
01:37:44,066 --> 01:37:47,861
I hope it's soon.
Thanks for everything. Goodbye.

790
01:37:55,286 --> 01:38:00,290
Judge, rest in peace, my friend.
I'll see they get to Arizona. I promise.

791
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:16,180
Alright, now! Let's go! Ride on!

792
01:38:16,849 --> 01:38:18,933
We're going!
- Ride on!
