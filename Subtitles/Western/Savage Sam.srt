    right up here in my head,   

981
01:38:52,891 --> 01:38:55,126
        And one day             
        when he wasn't lookin', 

982
01:38:55,194 --> 01:38:58,729
        Why, I got me a club    
        and I busted it right   
        over his head.          

983
01:38:58,797 --> 01:39:03,534
Then dang them, they threw me   
right in a pond, but I fought   
'em off just the same.          

984
01:39:03,602 --> 01:39:06,871
You know, I never will forget   
the day they killed             
and ate Old Jumper.             

985
01:39:06,939 --> 01:39:11,209
I picked me up a tree branch    
and clubbed the injun right     
over the head and laid him low. 

986
01:39:11,277 --> 01:39:14,379
Then danged if I didn't         
have to fight off               
half a dozen of 'em.            

987
01:39:14,446 --> 01:39:17,047
        I'd have licked 'em too 
        if one of them hadn't-- 

988
01:39:17,115 --> 01:39:19,433
Sure you don't wanna come       
to the ranch and get some grub ?

989
01:39:19,501 --> 01:39:23,170
Nope, I'll just be helpin'

    of 'em I'm beholden.        

992
01:39:32,447 --> 01:39:35,066
It was just somethin'           
that had to be done.            

993
01:39:55,621 --> 01:40:00,491
    It was then and there they  
    decided to make an injun out
    of me, 'cause of my bravery.

994
01:40:00,559 --> 01:40:04,662
