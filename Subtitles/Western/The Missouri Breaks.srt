1
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,902
(man) The first time I saw this country,

2
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:53,952
it had buffalo grass
and bluejoint up to the stirrups.

3
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:58,081
By the second year we had
8,000 Texas half-bred cattle

4
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:03,373
and over 3,500 volumes of
English literature in my library.

5
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:07,378
(man #2) We just cut out
the unbranded stock

6
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:10,550
and divided 'em up between the outfits.

7
00:03:10,683 --> 00:03:14,895
There was no arguin'
over mavericks like today.

8
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:17,346
(man #3) You got it good today.

9
00:03:17,482 --> 00:03:21,776
(man #1) Two per cent annual loss then.
Now it's seven from rustling alone,

10
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:27,775
not to mention winterkill, calving loss,
miring down in the spring.

11
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:35,996
How many are you?

12
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:44,585
Mr Braxton, did you see they sew old boot
tops on the saddle to hold ammunition?

13
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:47,837
Pete, don't pester him
if he doesn't wanna be pestered.

14
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:51,838
Well, it'd just be awful nice
to know the whole story.

15
00:03:52,976 --> 00:03:56,510
Well... it's beautiful country.

16
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,062
Yes, sir. It sure is.

17
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:05,690
You especially feel that now?

18
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:12,317
Yeah.

19
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,336
(singing "Oh, Susannah")

20
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,573
Sh, sh, sh.

21
00:05:05,214 --> 00:05:07,705
(child cries)

22
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:13,303
I sure hope them sportin' ladies
don't get sunburned.

23
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:17,136
I like 'em white as pastry.

24
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:20,809
Ladies.

25
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:35,906
Are we all set here?

26
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:38,492
All set, Pete.

27
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:55,047
Shall we start the horse... or will you?

28
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:58,430
I will, sir.

29
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:35,555
(man) Well, that's one of them.

30
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:43,135
His name was Sandy Chase and he came
here from Rhode Island with the army.

31
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:45,513
He was 24 years old.

32
00:06:48,484 --> 00:06:54,404
We lost seven per cent of stock between
spring and fall last year, to rustlers.

33
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:58,482
You always mention the percentage.
I wonder why you do that.

34
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,823
This is my fourth frontier
and I know how they run.

35
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,791
I was in the California gold fields
before I was 18.

36
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:08,785
I was at the rush at Alder Gulch
and I went to South America.

37
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:12,871
These long ropers in the Missouri Breaks
are a mixed bag.

38
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:15,630
Barbers from Minneapolis,

39
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:21,136
failed grangers, Scandinavian half-breeds,
wolfers and woodcutters,

40
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:25,265
dishonest apprentices,
raftsmen, poisoners.

41
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:29,770
You give them a chance
and they'll waste everything.

42
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:41,154
You're astonished at my arrogance,
at not even having a trial, aren't you?

43
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,952
Then why don't you get over it?

44
00:07:44,082 --> 00:07:48,708
Our situation has become
nearly as bad as it could be.

45
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:53,214
Honey, pull down Tristram Shandy again
for me, would you?

46
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:10,771
Daddy.

47
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:17,611
Excuse me.

48
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:32,583
Come on! Giddap! Yah!

49
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,786
Got the gate.

50
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:24,634
How'd she go, Tom?

51
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:28,217
Everybody else been back a day.

52
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:32,931
Brought in about 14 head
of the first-class order.

53
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:35,188
Yeah.

54
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,315
- Hey.
- Hey.

55
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:42,482
How was Wyoming?

56
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:44,823
It was fine.

57
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:50,907
Spent a couple of days in KC trying to
keep from associating with criminals.

58
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:55,122
Why, they've hit the Union Pacific
down there so many times

59
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:58,919
the place has begun to look like
a lawmen's convention.

60
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,338
They got two Pinkerton in KC

61
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:06,296
and I do believe one of 'em
was the legendary Charlie Siringo.

62
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:10,926
Did he claim to be a border cowboy?

63
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:14,312
Can't remember.
Said he could talk Mexican.

64
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,480
Yeah, that's him.

65
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,309
How'd you know it was a detective?

66
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:25,155
Rancher's wife wanting to go to bed
with him. He kept givin' her a "no".

67
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:27,822
Damned if I can understand that.

68
00:10:27,954 --> 00:10:30,990
- Well, I took care of her, Cal.
- You did that, huh?

69
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:34,623
You're damn sure.
Had a good time too, thank you.

70
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:36,246
Did you?

71
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:41,420
Spent the night in Martinsdale.
Couldn't get no credit at the whorehouse,

72
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,797
so I picked up this chubby little girl
off some sodbuster's outfit.

73
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,385
Yeah... How was she?

74
00:10:52,645 --> 00:10:58,315
About like a Swiss clock. Same exact
movement over and over again.

75
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:01,773
Yeah.

76
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:21,567
- It was Sandy, huh?
- Yeah.

77
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:24,903
Yeah.

78
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:28,707
Sandy's gone. He's dead.

79
00:11:28,832 --> 00:11:33,541
David Braxton's foreman...
What's his name, Cary?

80
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,876
- Pete Marker.
- Pete Marker.

81
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:38,675
...caught him and they hung him.

82
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:42,209
Goddamn it.

83
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:45,679
I knew somebody's bunch
wasn't in that corral.

84
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:51,805
Little Tod was in town.
Everybody was at the hanging.

85
00:11:56,735 --> 00:12:00,269
- How'd Sandy go out?
- Pretty good. Pretty good.

86
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:05,612
They hung him up on a cottonwood,
though, and he sort of...

87
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:10,196
He sort of what?

88
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,204
Sort of strangled for a while.

89
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:18,255
Braxton was there dressed in a suit.

90
00:12:18,381 --> 00:12:21,216
- Lookin' like God.
- Hah!

91
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:27,138
Goddamn.

92
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:30,385
I'll tell you, the first time I met Sandy...

93
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:32,725
Listen at this, now.

94
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:36,223
The first time I met Sandy,
he was rustling on his own.

95
00:12:36,358 --> 00:12:40,402
He had a stolen cavalry pony
and he kept this dog.

96
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:45,526
As soon as he killed a steer, he'd cut
the brand off and feed it to the dog.

97
00:12:45,658 --> 00:12:48,114
He said to get enough
evidence to convict him

98
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:51,162
they'd have to pick through
the dog's shit for a week

99
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:54,160
before they could find the brand.

100
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:07,884
My aunt ran a laundry in St Paul.

101
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:12,724
Got strangled by a Chinaman
while she's washing her dog.

102
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:15,806
It's easy to die. Easy!

103
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:20,434
Well, they sure killed Sandy.

104
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:24,780
He was the only comedian in this outfit.
Every outfit oughta have a comedian.

105
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:28,026
You can't run that many rustled horses
across open ground.

106
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,077
I know I've been saying that.
But you can't.

107
00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:36,827
What do we do, Tom? Open up a stand
and sell stolen horses over the counter?

108
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,578
No. We gotta get a relay ranch
halfway across

109
00:13:40,713 --> 00:13:43,169
so as we got somewheres
to relay 'em at.

110
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:47,677
- That's right.
- That's just really great.

111
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:49,843
Only we ain't got a ranch.

112
00:13:49,973 --> 00:13:53,638
We ain't got no money!
The only horses we got are out there.

113
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:57,184
We can't move them across the breaks
without everybody knowing.

114
00:13:57,313 --> 00:14:00,148
Let's just stick up the NP Railroad
and buy a ranch.

115
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:02,148
Hell, let's rob a bank.

116
00:14:02,277 --> 00:14:06,226
If we're gonna get hung for rustlin' horses,
we oughta be robbin' trains.

117
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:09,318
Why don't you boys join
that Hole-in-the-Wall bunch

118
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,866
and you'll be around people
that think like that?

119
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:24,214
Boy, a couple of years ago they'd have
put Sandy in Red Lodge penitentiary,

120
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,380
weavin' bridles.

121
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:32,800
Seems like there's
something new in the air.

122
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:41,521
I bet you Marker'll bait crows with Sandy
for a week before he'll cut him down.

123
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:45,564
I worked for that son of a bitch once
on the reservation roundup.

124
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:48,447
He will leave Sandy in the trees.

125
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:55,068
When we was fightin' in Kansas,
we had relays all over the damn place.

126
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,956
We relayed a cousin of mine

127
00:14:58,082 --> 00:15:01,582
all the way from Medicine Tree
to the hot springs in New Mexico.

128
00:15:01,711 --> 00:15:03,620
He beat the telegraph.

129
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:08,251
Took the detectives two years to cover
the same ground he'd covered in a week.

130
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:12,596
And when they got there
he was in his grave up on the Chama.

131
00:15:12,722 --> 00:15:17,467
Why was you havin' to move
this cousin around so much?

132
00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:20,271
He did card tricks.

133
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:22,436
I get it.

134
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:29,436
He done a trick for this nigger on
the Chama. The nigger throttled him.

135
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:32,028
Mm-hm. I see.

136
00:15:35,286 --> 00:15:37,777
Say, Cal...

137
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:41,497
Why don't we put that relay
in Braxton's backyard?

138
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:46,627
Yeah.

139
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,132
It beats sendin' three or four horses
at a time out into Kansas.

140
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:55,547
The law there is pretty effective now.

141
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:03,851
I get a kick out of Little Tod.
He says we oughta rob a train.

142
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,318
No...

143
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:14,648
I'm tired, Cal.

144
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:20,242
I'm gonna turn in.
Tomorrow we have a nice day.

145
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,335
Too bad about Sandy.

146
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:56,867
(train whistle)

147
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,790
(cocks gun)

148
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:54,331
All right, move over there. Move, move!

149
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:57,384
I want you to uncouple that car. Hurry up!

150
00:17:57,512 --> 00:18:01,046
I can't do it. I'm not sure I'm able to do it.

151
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:03,305
Just get down there and pull the pin out.

152
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:07,930
- I'm a clerk. I'm not mechanical.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

153
00:18:21,244 --> 00:18:23,035
Whoo-hoo!

154
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:40,174
- Get the money out. What's your name?
- Nelson.

155
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:42,214
Nelson, you do this right,

156
00:18:42,348 --> 00:18:47,259
you can say you've seen Jesse James
and lived to tell the story.

157
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:50,064
You're not Jesse James.

158
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:53,605
You ain't Charlie Siringo.
Just give me the money, Nelson.

159
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:58,112
- I'm not permitted to touch this.
- Gimme the goddamn money.

160
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:04,483
Whoa!

161
00:19:16,716 --> 00:19:17,830
Gee!

162
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:21,881
- Don't start blamin' me.
- I am blamin' you.

163
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,800
This is it on trains. This is it.

164
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:26,213
God Almighty.

165
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,387
This is it. No more trains, Tod.

166
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,723
- I just don't wanna get blamed.
- Sh...

167
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:35,146
We got it! It's all over the place.

168
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:36,984
Yahoo!

169
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:40,436
(Little Tod laughs) We got it.

170
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:46,944
- You need some help?
- Just pick up the money, goddamn it.

171
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,906
Agh!

172
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:55,496
But they're all ones.
Tom, they're all ones.

173
00:19:57,423 --> 00:20:02,050
- Where am I gonna put 'em all?
- I don't wanna hear that now. Just...

174
00:20:04,764 --> 00:20:06,472
Ain't it just terrible?

175
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:11,142
The next time you mention trains,
it's gonna get worse.

176
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:16,140
You boys new at this?

177
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:22,738
Appreciate your concern, Nelson.

178
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:25,941
(laughing)

179
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:27,488
Yahoo!

180
00:20:28,704 --> 00:20:30,946
Let's get every goddamn one up.

181
00:20:31,082 --> 00:20:34,036
Hey, look! There's tens in the water.

182
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:37,003
Get in there, Tod.
Get in the water. Get those tens.

183
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:39,537
Yahoo!

184
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:44,552
(train whistle)

185
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:48,345
Little Tod...

186
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,012
Get out of my way.

187
00:20:57,275 --> 00:21:00,192
Come on. Let's get outta here
with what we got.

188
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:24,174
Mornin', my little darlin'.

189
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:27,884
Hey, Si. We'll see 'em in church.

190
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,765
I think all of you working men and women

191
00:21:35,897 --> 00:21:39,100
have had time now to consider
this case before us.

192
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:42,353
- There's Braxton.
- I have reviewed its details,

193
00:21:42,486 --> 00:21:46,152
and now I feel secure enough
to pronounce sentence.

194
00:21:46,282 --> 00:21:49,651
Subject, of course,
to your scrutiny and support.

195
00:21:49,785 --> 00:21:52,241
(man) Make him confess first.

196
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:55,657
I think the kindest thing
we can do to this bird

197
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,543
is to send him up to the territorial prison.

198
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:03,415
He's been about as cooperative
as any prisoner we've tried around here.

199
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:07,926
- I see no direct call to hang him.
- Don't he look like God?

200
00:22:08,054 --> 00:22:11,470
Who's got an opinion about
how long we might send him up?

201
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,683
- (man) Life is indicated.
- (woman) He'll take anything.

202
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,017
How would 10 to 20 sound to you?

203
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:21,274
Sounds about right to me.
How soon would I be eligible for parole?

204
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,271
- In about two weeks.
- (laughter)

205
00:22:26,697 --> 00:22:30,777
Anything you'd like to say
before we send you to your just deserts?

206
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,401
And if I may speak for the court,

207
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:36,373
we would prefer
that it be something colourful,

208
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:39,665
life on the frontier being what it is.

209
00:22:40,503 --> 00:22:42,542
Just that...

210
00:22:44,674 --> 00:22:50,463
it may seem to you boys
like a hard way to make the papers,

211
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:54,131
but I'm not ashamed of robbing that train,

212
00:22:54,266 --> 00:23:00,636
of blowing bridges, sticking up banks, or
for my careless devil-may-care gunplay.

213
00:23:00,773 --> 00:23:02,433
(laughter)

214
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:06,564
I'm not ashamed of pissing away
the money on hard living either,

215
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:09,815
because I'm that kind of guy.

216
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:13,234
But as a concession to me
for my cooperation,

217
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:17,069
I would like you all
to refer to me from now on

218
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:19,779
as "The Lonesome Kid".

219
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:25,084
Especially in front of outsiders
here in the West.

220
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:31,169
That's enough of that! Let's all go up
to the bar and make fools of ourselves.

221
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:33,343
(music starts)

222
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:48,900
Yahoo!

223
00:23:50,364 --> 00:23:54,693
(Braxton) Whoo! I haven't danced like that
since Chicago.

224
00:23:54,827 --> 00:23:56,535
I'm Tom Logan.

225
00:23:56,662 --> 00:24:03,163
I'd like to congratulate you, sir,
on your treatment of that impostor.

226
00:24:03,294 --> 00:24:05,963
Oh... My daughter, Jane.

227
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:07,464
Hello.

228
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,591
People have told me
I should talk to you, Mr Braxton.

229
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:14,003
I just sold a family implement business
in the Shonkin range

230
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:17,637
and I'm thinkin' of buying a small ranch.

231
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,305
You done so well I'd like
a piece out by you for good luck.

232
00:24:27,151 --> 00:24:30,152
Well... the Cannon Ranch is for sale.

233
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:35,650
Isn't much. Four sections and a cabin.
Pole corrals around it.

234
00:24:35,785 --> 00:24:39,485
But it's well watered,
and pretty fair shelter.

235
00:24:40,623 --> 00:24:44,537
The owner's living in town now.
Has a cooperage at the end of Main,

236
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:46,708
past the livery.

237
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,000
I understand you had
some rustlin' problems.

238
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:53,968
Seven per cent losses per annum.

239
00:24:55,554 --> 00:25:00,893
You should know about that.
First year, that might just break you.

240
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:02,927
Mm...

241
00:25:03,062 --> 00:25:07,106
I understand
you had to hang someone here.

242
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:10,357
I did that.

243
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:13,485
Oh, that's tough.

244
00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:18,191
What was this?
Some kind of a desperado?

245
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:19,702
No.

246
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:24,621
He was a thief, with probably a million
good reasons for being on hard times.

247
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,333
The main thing is that
we put him out of his misery.

248
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,123
Don't you believe
in hangin' thieves, miss?

249
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:37,300
No, sir, I don't. Do you?

250
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:42,341
I surely do. How in the world else
are we gonna have law and order?

251
00:25:44,103 --> 00:25:46,724
Well, what do you know?

252
00:25:46,856 --> 00:25:51,102
Maybe you can buy that Cannon Ranch,
get started in the cattle business.

253
00:25:51,235 --> 00:25:53,311
With your attitude toward human life,

254
00:25:53,445 --> 00:25:56,861
you may yet get to be
one of the barons of this prairie,

255
00:25:56,991 --> 00:26:01,617
and have your picture on page one,
or page three, of the Chicago papers.

256
00:26:01,745 --> 00:26:06,740
And for your birthday you can have
a big barrel of fresh oysters on ice,

257
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:10,458
just the way the other hangmen
up this way do.

258
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:14,380
You sound bitter, lady.

259
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:17,379
You should have seen
that young man's face.

260
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:20,263
- He did not die quickly.
- I don't wanna hear about it.

261
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:23,425
I don't think you can really picture
the man's face.

262
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:26,726
I don't want to hear about it, miss.

263
00:26:28,063 --> 00:26:30,733
Thank you for your information,
Mr Braxton.

264
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:36,197
I'll go over to the cooperage and ask
Mr Cannon about them four sections.

265
00:26:36,322 --> 00:26:38,991
Pleasure to meet you too, miss.

266
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:58,041
Welcome to town, now.

267
00:26:58,177 --> 00:27:01,510
Damn, I feel better now.

268
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:03,678
- Damned if I don't.
- Me too.

269
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:05,847
(thunder)

270
00:27:12,816 --> 00:27:15,438
Oh, God! You didn't cut him down yet.

271
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:17,609
We did! That's...

272
00:27:19,323 --> 00:27:21,150
Whoa!

273
00:27:22,785 --> 00:27:25,951
- Oh...
- Oh, Pete.

274
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,867
My God. They've killed my man.

275
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:38,714
- Si, are we gonna go to that whorehouse?
- Where the hell you clodhoppers been at?

276
00:27:38,842 --> 00:27:42,211
File that. We got it.
Let's go for a ride.

277
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:45,263
I wanna go to a whorehouse,
play cards, get drunk.

278
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:50,136
We can go to the whorehouse later.
Ain't you got no pride of ownership?

279
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:53,722
I buy you a brand-new ranch.
Do you wanna ride out and look at it?

280
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:56,942
Hell, we own it, we can go anytime.
Let's go for a drink.

281
00:27:57,069 --> 00:28:00,319
- Let's play cards...
- Let's go to the whorehouse.

282
00:28:00,447 --> 00:28:04,908
You're gonna have to pick and choose
on that cos the money's about all gone.

283
00:28:05,035 --> 00:28:08,036
- The money can't be gone.
- Well, it is and I'm glad.

284
00:28:08,163 --> 00:28:09,871
- I'm glad too.
- Why?

285
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:11,825
Because robbin' trains is...

286
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:16,502
We start a pattern of robbin' trains
and we're gonna get detectives.

287
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,964
From then, you can back
the calendar down till they hang us.

288
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:22,131
That's why.

289
00:28:26,807 --> 00:28:31,765
I still think we should rob a bank.
Rob trains, rob a bank.

290
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:35,347
- All right, let's go to the whorehouse.
- Mm-mm.

291
00:28:44,742 --> 00:28:46,983
You here for a party?

292
00:28:49,163 --> 00:28:52,532
- That's right.
- What kind of a party?

293
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,709
(sniggering)

294
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,880
Well...

295
00:29:02,885 --> 00:29:05,506
You got any girls?

296
00:29:16,857 --> 00:29:18,897
Go on, Si.

297
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:32,162
The girls here can show you
to the party rooms.

298
00:29:33,374 --> 00:29:35,413
I like them ribbons.

299
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:38,914
Anybody want anything to eat?

300
00:29:40,631 --> 00:29:45,838
Well, is he the one that I want.
You just come right on up here with me.

301
00:29:49,014 --> 00:29:52,134
Where are the chubby ones?
I want a chub...

302
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:54,307
Oh, yeah.

303
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:58,646
Ain't that a match-up?
Ain't that a match-up?

304
00:29:58,774 --> 00:30:01,395
Just like you and your horse, Little Tod.

305
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:18,829
- That one got away!
- You'll pay for that.

306
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:21,796
In my home town,
I'm considered a dangerous person.

307
00:30:21,922 --> 00:30:27,758
Yeah? In your home town a man can get
a bad reputation for smokin' corn silk.

308
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:32,758
Cary'll stay at the breaks,
but somebody must tend this place.

309
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:36,759
I can tell you one damn thing,
it isn't gonna be me.

310
00:30:36,895 --> 00:30:38,520
Agh!

311
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,442
I got you! Told you I was gonna get you,
you son of a bitch.

312
00:30:46,572 --> 00:30:48,611
Here! How about this?

313
00:31:00,752 --> 00:31:03,208
I like this place, Cal.

314
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:07,421
- Yeah.
- I like it quiet.

315
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:09,965
(clattering)

316
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:14,424
Cary, don't throw them tools
down there like that, please.

317
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:19,934
I spent my first 18 years
on one of these goddamn things,

318
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:22,389
workin' for my uncle that raised me.

319
00:31:22,524 --> 00:31:25,062
I worked myself cross-eyed too.

320
00:31:26,403 --> 00:31:31,148
About the only thing I had for distraction
was this dog.

321
00:31:32,117 --> 00:31:35,616
I'd had the dog since it was ten years old.

322
00:31:36,788 --> 00:31:39,624
And he shot it...

323
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:44,292
for stickin' its tongue on a pat of butter.

324
00:31:45,214 --> 00:31:47,705
So I stayed one more night.

325
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,593
And I killed his seed bull,
I rustled every damn horse he had

326
00:31:53,722 --> 00:31:57,767
including a racer that I sold as
a cow pony to an Indian rancher,

327
00:31:57,893 --> 00:32:00,218
and I took the whole damn remuda.

328
00:32:00,354 --> 00:32:03,687
I come within a hair's breadth
of sendin' him to kingdom come.

329
00:32:03,815 --> 00:32:08,857
I was that close to shootin'
that son of a bitch in the brainpan.

330
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:16,192
I never did have that kind of background.

331
00:32:16,328 --> 00:32:20,491
Never had nothin' neither.
My folks always wanted a place.

332
00:32:20,624 --> 00:32:23,874
They was good people,
so I always saw it with their eyes.

333
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:26,244
I can see that.

334
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:32,383
But when you think about it, you wouldn't
want the weight of a damn place like this.

335
00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:38,468
Do you do alterations too, ma'am?

336
00:32:41,603 --> 00:32:43,643
Nope.

337
00:32:45,148 --> 00:32:50,024
And I don't do
your wire-ripped shirts neither.

338
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,529
There you go.

339
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,705
Si, you're beginnin' to sound
like a real old lady.

340
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:03,701
What do you say
we just jump this pissant seamstress?

341
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:07,914
You guys are soon gonna learn
to treat me nice.

342
00:33:08,046 --> 00:33:10,917
- Yahoo!
- Whoa! Watch it!

343
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:12,709
Come on! I'll kill ya.

344
00:33:12,843 --> 00:33:16,212
Everybody's so scared of the Mounties
that nobody even tries.

345
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:18,173
The horses are hardly guarded.

346
00:33:18,307 --> 00:33:23,893
- You talkin' to me about Canada again?
- You're goddamn right I am.

347
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:26,097
Them Mounties scares me, Cal.

348
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:29,730
Hell, they scare everybody.
That's why it'll be so easy.

349
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,066
The Indians won't touch them horses.

350
00:33:32,195 --> 00:33:35,066
We can take all 60 of them ponies
at a walk.

351
00:33:38,702 --> 00:33:41,110
All Canadian government brand?

352
00:33:41,246 --> 00:33:47,201
Until we can get 'em to the breaks for
modification, and then down here to relay.

353
00:33:47,336 --> 00:33:50,420
That doesn't quite
settle it though, does it?

354
00:33:50,547 --> 00:33:53,003
No, it don't.

355
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:57,254
Someone's gonna have to stay here.

356
00:33:57,387 --> 00:34:00,258
Well, it isn't gonna be me.

357
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,683
It's gotta be one of the two of us,
and I'll tell you one thing.

358
00:34:04,811 --> 00:34:08,595
You had all the fun on that train
while I baby-sat these savages.

359
00:34:08,732 --> 00:34:13,145
I'm going to Canada for sure.
That's settled. That's it.

360
00:34:28,335 --> 00:34:30,790
(sighs)

361
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:34,337
I gotta stay on this
goddamn piece of ground.

362
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:37,550
Goddamn! I can't even believe this!

363
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:44,927
That is pitiful.
You assholes will just get lost.

364
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:50,647
- He was the best foreman.
- He was the only foreman I ever had.

365
00:34:50,774 --> 00:34:54,724
- Pete Marker was a hard man.
- He surely was, David.

366
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:59,903
He could break a horse better than
the bronc fighters. He could do every job.

367
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:02,607
He was a great ramrod.

368
00:35:02,744 --> 00:35:07,536
He personified the American West
in the days of its rowdy youth.

369
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:10,121
- Sure did.
- Excuse me.

370
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:04,848
- Lee Clayton.
- Oh, my God, you gave me a scare.

371
00:36:04,973 --> 00:36:09,516
- All I could see was your horse.
- That was all you were meant to see.

372
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,687
Is the owner about?

373
00:36:13,815 --> 00:36:16,520
Who may I say is calling?

374
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:20,020
Lee Clayton. I just said that.

375
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,984
I have a short memory.

376
00:36:27,037 --> 00:36:29,824
Well, I'll tell Daddy that you're here,

377
00:36:29,956 --> 00:36:32,661
and then I can get back
to what I was doing before.

378
00:36:32,793 --> 00:36:38,665
Tell him Lee Clayton from Medicine Hat,
Wyoming. Here on business.

379
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:41,040
- You got it?
- Yes.

380
00:37:00,946 --> 00:37:04,778
- Come in. I've been expecting you.
- Oh, sir.

381
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:08,526
I don't know why it would not
have tired me more than it did,

382
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:14,202
to have travelled all this distance
without more than a catnap.

383
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:17,917
You've a wonderful set of books here, sir.

384
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:20,252
- Yes, I have.
- Truly, truly beautiful.

385
00:37:20,382 --> 00:37:22,588
I don't spend the time with them I should.

386
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:29,965
I'm of the opinion... I would only claim
books that was about right from wrong.

387
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,762
Otherwise how are we to find
our paradise among the stars?

388
00:37:34,896 --> 00:37:36,936
True. Please.

389
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,109
Oh, sir. I'm sorry for your trouble.
I wasn't aware.

390
00:37:43,238 --> 00:37:46,821
Gentlemen, Robert E Lee Clayton.

391
00:37:51,538 --> 00:37:54,029
I understand that you hung a thief

392
00:37:54,165 --> 00:37:59,408
and neglected to find out where they were
caching the stock. How was that?

393
00:37:59,546 --> 00:38:01,788
He didn't wanna talk. He was about to die.

394
00:38:01,923 --> 00:38:05,838
Oh, I see. Then you pampered him.

395
00:38:05,969 --> 00:38:09,005
- No, sir!
- We hung that man.

396
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:12,590
Well, you pampered the man...
you pampered the man,

397
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:17,684
and the result of that
is the loss of this poor man's life!

398
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:21,472
- Please, this is outrageous.
- You, you, you...

399
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:25,144
- (woman screams)
- Take your hands off!

400
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,781
Realise the fact that as a result of that
this poor man has lost his life.

401
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:37,831
If you'd invited me into the neighbourhood
before, it wouldn't have happened.

402
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:40,960
You've got to give me some thoughts.

403
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:46,091
I'm gonna turn my horse out.
Then I'll wash my body.

404
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:52,926
And, miss...
the only thing not on my diet

405
00:38:53,058 --> 00:38:57,435
would be the green top of the beet
and okra.

406
00:38:57,979 --> 00:39:03,649
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me,
but I'm under a severe attack from a tooth.

407
00:39:03,777 --> 00:39:06,612
Sir. Miss.

408
00:39:13,203 --> 00:39:16,073
- Where'd he come from?
- What was all that about?

409
00:39:16,206 --> 00:39:20,618
I got recommendations for this man from
all the Wyoming outfits he's worked for.

410
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:24,038
- I'm assured that he's a top regulator.
- Regulator?

411
00:39:24,172 --> 00:39:28,419
- You mean you asked him up here?
- You're damn right I did.

412
00:39:28,551 --> 00:39:31,802
They killed my ramrod
and I want them to pay for it.

413
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,421
I always wondered
what Lee Clayton looked like.

414
00:39:34,557 --> 00:39:37,428
And smelled like.

415
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,849
I always figured him to be a little fella.

416
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,598
He's supposed to have a Creedmore rifle
he carries as a saddle gun.

417
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:45,975
Supposed to be able
to hit out to 500 yards.

418
00:39:46,111 --> 00:39:48,898
- Oh, Mr Rate. 500 yards...
- I mean it.

419
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:52,197
He never carries a side arm,
so you know he's a dry-gulcher.

420
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:56,026
But he smells like a wet-gulcher
and he dresses like a clown.

421
00:39:56,162 --> 00:39:59,614
He don't have no wife,
but he sure keeps himself spruced up.

422
00:39:59,749 --> 00:40:05,289
Many a rustler has said his prayers when
he got a whiff of them lavender bath salts.

423
00:40:05,422 --> 00:40:08,707
(chattering and laughter continues)

424
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,969
- Daddy, I wanna know how...
- Not now. Shh!

425
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:19,302
- Vern, scat. Out of here.
- You betcha. I will.

426
00:40:19,686 --> 00:40:24,099
- Adios, buddies.
- Send you a postal card from Canada.

427
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:26,688
Cal, why can't I go to Canada?

428
00:40:26,818 --> 00:40:29,487
You gotta tend to the cabin
in the breaks, Cary.

429
00:40:29,612 --> 00:40:34,654
You don't hear Tom complainin'.
See you in a few weeks, Tom.

430
00:40:37,203 --> 00:40:39,243
(horse neighs)

431
00:40:40,206 --> 00:40:44,536
They'll be back, Buck.
Don't you worry about it.

432
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:58,304
Well, by gosh. Good mornin' to you, miss.

433
00:40:58,433 --> 00:41:02,596
Good morning to you, Mr Logan.
You bought this place already, huh?

434
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:04,271
Yes, ma'am.

435
00:41:04,397 --> 00:41:08,858
I guess that kinda
makes us neighbours, doesn't it?

436
00:41:09,944 --> 00:41:14,108
- Where are you headed?
- Oh, I'm gonna go over on the table.

437
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,612
Well, may I accompany you?

438
00:41:16,743 --> 00:41:18,782
No.

439
00:41:18,912 --> 00:41:23,040
- Why not?
- No good reason. I don't want company.

440
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:26,202
Come on. Give me a chance.

441
00:41:26,336 --> 00:41:30,084
Give you a chance.
Give you a chance for what?

442
00:41:30,215 --> 00:41:35,636
Miss, I'm gonna take this opportunity
to be just a little damn bit offended.

443
00:41:35,762 --> 00:41:38,300
Cos if there's anybody in this district

444
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:42,927
who's got a right to think of themselves
as wholesome companionship,

445
00:41:43,061 --> 00:41:45,730
why, it's yours truly.

446
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:55,478
If you're such a wholesome companion,
what were you doing at the whorehouse?

447
00:41:55,615 --> 00:41:57,655
Who in the world told you that?

448
00:41:57,784 --> 00:42:00,951
Mary O'Connell,
that little blonde you paid for.

449
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,285
Well, I hope that's all she told you.

450
00:42:03,414 --> 00:42:06,581
She told me everything.
We're starved for news out here.

451
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:10,956
- All I ever hear about is grass.
- What's the matter with grass?

452
00:42:11,089 --> 00:42:14,624
Samuel Johnson said
"A blade of grass is a blade of grass."

453
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:19,421
- "Tell me about a human being."
- I don't understand that.

454
00:42:19,556 --> 00:42:23,803
It just means that Samuel Johnson
was as bored as I am with nature.

455
00:42:23,935 --> 00:42:26,770
We had a famous painter
out here last year.

456
00:42:26,896 --> 00:42:31,309
That man must have painted ten square
miles of canvas, not one human face.

457
00:42:31,442 --> 00:42:36,603
I wish he'd painted that boy Sandy hangin'
up so decoratively against the mountains.

458
00:42:36,739 --> 00:42:39,112
Because his pink tongue and white face

459
00:42:39,242 --> 00:42:41,947
would have set off
the green of Montana splendidly.

460
00:42:42,078 --> 00:42:47,073
I mean, it would have made the
damnedest bank calendar you ever saw.

461
00:42:48,168 --> 00:42:52,165
Well, you succeeded. This is where
I was coming to and you're still with me.

462
00:42:52,297 --> 00:42:54,752
The persistence
of the young rancher, huh?

463
00:42:54,883 --> 00:42:59,877
- Well, I know what I want is all.
- What do you want?

464
00:43:00,013 --> 00:43:03,097
I mean, I know what it is
when I want something.

465
00:43:03,224 --> 00:43:06,676
- Oh, come on!
- "Oh, come on" what?

466
00:43:06,811 --> 00:43:11,556
- Why don't you just say what you mean?
- This is what I mean.

467
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:15,771
- Do you want me?
- What does that mean?

468
00:43:15,904 --> 00:43:19,107
I mean you're followin' me around.
What you got in mind?

469
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,360
- Me?
- Sexual intercourse?

470
00:43:23,995 --> 00:43:26,201
- Oh, my...
- Well, all right.

471
00:43:26,873 --> 00:43:28,581
All right.

472
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:31,911
Come on. Get down off your horse.

473
00:43:32,045 --> 00:43:36,837
I'm not gonna have any hesitation from
you. Not from a frequenter of whores.

474
00:43:36,966 --> 00:43:39,671
All right, all right. Just back off.

475
00:43:39,802 --> 00:43:42,756
I'm gonna step down at my own speed.

476
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:47,139
All right.

477
00:43:49,145 --> 00:43:54,305
I'm going to lose it right here,
in all these blades of grass.

478
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,815
Do I have to come to you? All right.

479
00:43:57,946 --> 00:44:00,068
- Hold it.
- What?

480
00:44:00,198 --> 00:44:03,068
Who asked you to do all this?

481
00:44:03,201 --> 00:44:06,202
- Well, your entire behaviour...
- Never mind that.

482
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:09,449
I didn't ask you.
You said that you wanted it.

483
00:44:09,582 --> 00:44:12,120
- Well, do you?
- No.

484
00:44:12,252 --> 00:44:16,201
- Well, you're not gonna get it.
- Keep the dang thing. I don't want it.

485
00:44:16,339 --> 00:44:21,048
- I forgot. You do have your whores.
- Sure do. Like 'em too.

486
00:44:21,177 --> 00:44:23,668
I'll tell you something. If you want them...

487
00:44:23,805 --> 00:44:28,431
I keep tellin' ya. I want them a lot.
I don't want you at all.

488
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:30,718
Why are you bein' so mean to me?

489
00:44:30,853 --> 00:44:34,768
People have neglected to tell you
what a nasty little bitch you are,

490
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:37,473
and I'm makin' up for their negligence.

491
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:40,813
I just seem mean.
I'm only being thorough.

492
00:44:46,536 --> 00:44:52,954
If you're gonna start that, I'm gonna go
home and shovel manure on the pansies.

493
00:44:54,669 --> 00:44:58,453
Well, you just wait a minute
because I'm gonna stop.

494
00:45:02,385 --> 00:45:04,508
You gonna talk nice?

495
00:45:04,637 --> 00:45:06,844
I will do my best.

496
00:45:07,557 --> 00:45:09,596
You bastard.

497
00:45:10,727 --> 00:45:14,724
- Can I have a kiss?
- No. I hardly know you.

498
00:45:14,856 --> 00:45:20,728
Why don't we take a walk and talk about
the Wild West and how to get out of it?

499
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:26,444
Well... all right. I can talk about that.

500
00:45:27,702 --> 00:45:30,537
Cal, I forgot how to tie a diamond hitch.

501
00:45:30,663 --> 00:45:33,783
- A squaw hitch is all you need.
- You'll be gone two weeks?

502
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:38,413
Give or take a few days. Cary, you're
gonna move some stock to make way.

503
00:45:38,546 --> 00:45:40,622
- No more than two...
- Or three at a time.

504
00:45:40,757 --> 00:45:44,968
- I've been doin' this for a while.
- I reckon you have. Let's go.

505
00:45:48,139 --> 00:45:50,215
Keep low, boy.

506
00:45:54,479 --> 00:45:56,934
Hell of a damn way to ride off.

507
00:45:59,108 --> 00:46:01,148
(yelling)

508
00:46:02,945 --> 00:46:06,112
- Stay with your horse.
- Get a hold.

509
00:46:06,616 --> 00:46:09,285
Si, stay with your horse! Si!

510
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:12,993
Goddamn it, he knows what he's doing.

511
00:46:14,957 --> 00:46:17,413
Si let go of the rope.

512
00:46:17,543 --> 00:46:19,583
Oh, Jesus.

513
00:46:19,712 --> 00:46:22,084
- Help!
- You're gonna drown!

514
00:46:22,215 --> 00:46:24,456
Help! Get me in.

515
00:46:28,596 --> 00:46:33,388
We did it. We crossed
that son of a bitch, didn't we?

516
00:46:33,518 --> 00:46:37,432
I couldn't swim,
but I was swimmin', right?

517
00:46:39,482 --> 00:46:41,225
I can! I did it!

518
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,932
We deserve a lot of damn credit.

519
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:47,735
We crossed the Mighty Mo
and I want some damn credit.

520
00:46:47,865 --> 00:46:52,658
Supposin' if the catfish
in that son of a bitch could eat a pig.

521
00:46:52,787 --> 00:46:55,242
Or a chicken.

522
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:59,581
Get out.

523
00:47:00,878 --> 00:47:03,334
- Easy, now.
- Tom!

524
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:08,090
Hey, Tom!

525
00:47:09,762 --> 00:47:11,304
Huh?

526
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:14,846
You're the only rancher
who hasn't met the new regulator.

527
00:47:14,976 --> 00:47:17,597
Tom Logan, Robert E Lee Clayton.

528
00:47:17,728 --> 00:47:22,141
It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance, sir.

529
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:25,026
Damn near... sucked my boot off.

530
00:47:26,779 --> 00:47:28,902
Pleasure to meet you.

531
00:47:29,031 --> 00:47:32,447
Regulator - ain't that like a dry-gulcher?

532
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:36,280
That's not the softest term
you could use, I'd say.

533
00:47:36,414 --> 00:47:40,162
Well, a regulator...
Correct me if I'm wrong.

534
00:47:40,793 --> 00:47:43,165
Isn't a regulator one of these boys

535
00:47:43,296 --> 00:47:46,415
that shoots people
and don't never get near 'em?

536
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:48,292
That's it.

537
00:47:51,053 --> 00:47:55,431
Well, what about the binoculars?
What are they for?

538
00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:00,437
Well, I've taken to watchin'
funny-lookin' birds.

539
00:48:01,731 --> 00:48:03,522
I see.

540
00:48:03,649 --> 00:48:05,725
Well, hell, I don't know.

541
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,356
I suppose if you didn't get a way off,
a mile or so to do the job,

542
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,566
you'd just get messy like I done here.

543
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,571
Easy, Tom. Don't let me down.

544
00:48:15,703 --> 00:48:20,032
I've just heard this from all the other
dreamers tryin' to ranch around here.

545
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:26,880
Lee, did you ever hit a man from a mile off
while he was carryin' a pail of water?

546
00:48:27,006 --> 00:48:29,675
A mile, well...

547
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,338
But I don't remember the pail.

548
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:35,089
No, sir.

549
00:48:36,474 --> 00:48:40,518
When you hang a man,
usually he has a chance to talk,

550
00:48:40,645 --> 00:48:43,895
or say goodbye, write a letter...

551
00:48:44,982 --> 00:48:47,769
Besides, a Creedmore...

552
00:48:49,278 --> 00:48:53,608
- It's a Creedmore, isn't it?
- It is a Creedmore, and a beautiful one.

553
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:56,659
Must make a pretty good
mess of a human.

554
00:48:56,786 --> 00:49:00,368
You hit a guy from 500 yards out, say,

555
00:49:00,498 --> 00:49:05,705
why, the suddenness of it, he don't have a
few seconds to make his act of contrition.

556
00:49:05,836 --> 00:49:08,458
And you never have to look him in the eye.

557
00:49:08,589 --> 00:49:11,211
Right there, that makes all the difference.

558
00:49:11,342 --> 00:49:15,422
I would disagree, sir. The thing that
makes all the difference in the world

559
00:49:15,555 --> 00:49:19,884
is the fact that it accomplishes
the task, you see.

560
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,302
This old boy in Wyoming...

561
00:49:23,437 --> 00:49:25,229
Whoa.

562
00:49:26,107 --> 00:49:31,018
This old boy in Wyoming, he sat down
just to pull sandburs out of his trousers,

563
00:49:31,153 --> 00:49:35,566
and his skull suddenly flew into pieces
about the size of your thumbnail.

564
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:40,445
That was the first time
I ever heard the term "regulator".

565
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,079
- That was the first time.
- First time.

566
00:49:47,211 --> 00:49:49,832
What would be your line of work, sir?

567
00:49:49,964 --> 00:49:53,214
I was in the implement business
up in the Shonkin Sag,

568
00:49:53,342 --> 00:49:56,711
but I started back in the ranch
south of here.

569
00:49:57,763 --> 00:50:01,263
You started back in? You was before...?

570
00:50:01,392 --> 00:50:05,805
My family used to have a place,
but when they lost it I hired out.

571
00:50:05,938 --> 00:50:08,014
Oh, I see.

572
00:50:08,149 --> 00:50:12,277
I certainly wish you
good fortune, Mr Logan.

573
00:50:12,403 --> 00:50:14,894
The times are hard on a small operator.

574
00:50:15,031 --> 00:50:16,904
Heyah!

575
00:50:18,868 --> 00:50:21,904
I hope the damn horse thieves
leave you something.

576
00:50:22,038 --> 00:50:25,323
- I hope so too.
- Good day to you, sir.

577
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:27,746
Bye-bye now.

578
00:50:27,877 --> 00:50:31,625
This colt of yours will be all right
if you can find a wet mare.

579
00:50:31,756 --> 00:50:33,795
- Is the mother dead?
- Yeah.

580
00:50:33,924 --> 00:50:37,922
She got bogged down in a mire
about a mile from here.

581
00:50:38,054 --> 00:50:41,838
- See you later, Tom. Thanks.
- All right, Mr Braxton.

582
00:50:41,974 --> 00:50:44,644
Damn those hands of mine.

583
00:50:45,895 --> 00:50:47,934
Good luck, Old Sloppy.

584
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,116
Must have smelled something.

585
00:51:03,245 --> 00:51:08,073
The closer you get towards Canada,
the more things eat your horses.

586
00:51:08,668 --> 00:51:12,712
Probably smelled a bear or a cat
or some damn thing.

587
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:15,543
Either one would go ahead
and eat your horse...

588
00:51:15,674 --> 00:51:17,714
Whoa...

589
00:51:21,472 --> 00:51:26,928
Damn! I don't know why they had
to put Canada way the hell up here.

590
00:51:37,488 --> 00:51:39,860
Well, hello, Jane.

591
00:51:40,991 --> 00:51:43,031
Hello, Tom.

592
00:51:44,286 --> 00:51:46,493
I didn't think I'd find you here.

593
00:51:46,622 --> 00:51:50,702
- Why'd you think that?
- Cos I haven't seen you.

594
00:51:50,835 --> 00:51:55,746
You thought I was gonna
come courtin', didn't ya?

595
00:51:55,881 --> 00:51:58,289
Maybe so. Mm-hm.

596
00:51:58,426 --> 00:52:02,922
You was too harsh to me last time.
I never kick a dead horse, lady.

597
00:52:06,726 --> 00:52:12,312
That sure is some garden you've started
here. Have you had one before?

598
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,307
No. My aunt had one
and I kinda took it over.

599
00:52:17,528 --> 00:52:20,066
I ain't half bad at it though.

600
00:52:20,197 --> 00:52:22,237
(chuckles) No.

601
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:28,536
Why don't you get down off your horse?

602
00:52:28,664 --> 00:52:30,704
I will, thank you.

603
00:52:34,628 --> 00:52:38,756
You're a lot nicer than you was before.
Why is that?

604
00:52:40,551 --> 00:52:45,592
Well, you didn't come courtin' me
like I figured you would, and...

605
00:52:45,723 --> 00:52:47,965
I'm...

606
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,342
You're what?

607
00:52:50,478 --> 00:52:53,728
I'm tryin' to revive your interest.

608
00:52:53,856 --> 00:52:56,525
Oh, yeah?

609
00:52:56,650 --> 00:53:01,396
Well... come here a minute
and I'll show you something.

610
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:08,908
All right.

611
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:11,870
Now lift that up.

612
00:53:16,045 --> 00:53:18,084
(water starts flowing)

613
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:25,550
(Jane laughs)

614
00:53:27,723 --> 00:53:30,890
Close her down. Garden's watered.

615
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:37,100
I admire you.

616
00:53:37,233 --> 00:53:41,776
Come in the house.
I'll make you a cup of chinee tea.

617
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:43,943
Chinese tea?

618
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:58,503
Northern Pacific Railroad.
Where did you get these?

619
00:53:58,629 --> 00:54:00,668
Just souvenirs.

620
00:54:08,472 --> 00:54:10,512
Mm...

621
00:54:11,475 --> 00:54:14,346
How long does the tea take?

622
00:54:14,478 --> 00:54:16,720
Five or ten minutes.

623
00:54:21,485 --> 00:54:23,941
Can I come over there?

624
00:54:27,908 --> 00:54:30,993
I'll come over there if you ask me to.

625
00:54:38,252 --> 00:54:40,659
Let's go over there.

626
00:54:46,802 --> 00:54:49,127
You sure about that?

627
00:54:52,224 --> 00:54:54,264
That's right.

628
00:54:56,437 --> 00:54:59,307
How do you know you're sure about that?

629
00:55:00,441 --> 00:55:02,683
Well, why do you think?

630
00:55:05,154 --> 00:55:09,566
Cos that's the reason why
you come out here in the first place.

631
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,450
That's right.

632
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,245
This here tea's gonna get black as ink.

633
00:55:23,505 --> 00:55:26,791
We'll write somebody a letter with it.

634
00:55:29,553 --> 00:55:32,471
Let's write your father a letter.

635
00:55:32,598 --> 00:55:37,343
Tell him that you're the prisoner
of the chinee tea slavers.

636
00:56:11,553 --> 00:56:14,424
Would you like to do this?

637
00:56:17,101 --> 00:56:20,351
Yeah... I would like to.

638
00:56:21,563 --> 00:56:24,101
That's what I would like to do.

639
00:56:34,034 --> 00:56:36,074
Sorry.

640
00:57:11,321 --> 00:57:13,777
(bird calls)

641
00:57:13,907 --> 00:57:15,947
God.

642
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,485
God, God.

643
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,660
(shrill bird calls)

644
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,960
(mumbles)

645
00:57:32,843 --> 00:57:35,251
Sniper, sniper, sniper.

646
00:57:56,617 --> 00:57:58,942
(whistles imitating bird)

647
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,576
(bugle call)

648
00:58:19,932 --> 00:58:23,135
Goddamn. They're pretty.

649
00:58:23,268 --> 00:58:27,100
Yeah. They're neat
little bastards, ain't they?

650
00:58:28,106 --> 00:58:31,392
(Cal) Oh, boy. There's more of 'em
than I expected.

651
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:35,275
(Little Tod) Yeah. Do you suppose
them catfish ever look up?

652
00:58:35,405 --> 00:58:38,276
- Piss on them.
- From up here?

653
00:58:41,036 --> 00:58:43,076
Sh!

654
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:48,449
Supposed to be
the best police in the world.

655
00:58:48,585 --> 00:58:52,500
- They don't scare me.
- Me neither.

656
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:57,127
Let's take these horses to the home
of the brave and the land of the free.

657
00:58:57,261 --> 00:58:58,459
- Not today.
- What?

658
00:58:58,595 --> 00:59:00,921
Not today!

659
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:03,096
Goddamn.

660
00:59:08,775 --> 00:59:12,855
I'm gonna have an awful lot of
explaining to do when I get home.

661
00:59:12,988 --> 00:59:16,606
But I'm not gonna lie my way
out of this one.

662
00:59:16,741 --> 00:59:18,983
Yes, I am.

663
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,488
- Which one?
- I'm gonna lie my way out of it.

664
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:26,787
- Where'd she go?
- Who?

665
00:59:26,918 --> 00:59:29,789
- Your ma.
- Oh...

666
00:59:29,921 --> 00:59:34,630
Well, she listened very carefully
to my father for about three years,

667
00:59:34,759 --> 00:59:36,337
weighed every word,

668
00:59:36,469 --> 00:59:42,638
and then she up and ran off with the first
unreasonable man that she could find.

669
00:59:42,767 --> 00:59:48,603
Wait a minute. Stop. This is a nice way
to ride, but I know a much better way.

670
00:59:49,774 --> 00:59:52,230
Where are you goin'?

671
00:59:58,533 --> 01:00:00,573
Ooh!

672
01:00:01,786 --> 01:00:05,238
- Well, that is clever.
- Yeah.

673
01:00:05,373 --> 01:00:08,208
Would you say that this is lewd conduct?

674
01:00:09,169 --> 01:00:11,411
Well, I couldn't say for sure.

675
01:00:12,631 --> 01:00:17,091
My father has a library full of law books,
cos he believes in the law.

676
01:00:17,218 --> 01:00:20,801
He says that we haven't got
any law up here yet.

677
01:00:22,224 --> 01:00:24,715
What brings that to your mind?

678
01:00:24,851 --> 01:00:30,640
Because in one of those law books of his,
there's a whole section on lewd conduct.

679
01:00:30,774 --> 01:00:34,688
- What about it?
- It's against the law.

680
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:44,531
Are you an outlaw?

681
01:00:47,666 --> 01:00:54,463
I'm a jackpot rancher with a milk cow and
100 square foot of root vegetables. Why?

682
01:00:54,589 --> 01:00:58,883
- Why do you have so many guns?
- Because I'm a sportsman.

683
01:01:00,637 --> 01:01:03,507
Why do you have a sawed-off shotgun?

684
01:01:04,516 --> 01:01:08,015
Well, because I'm a sawed-off sportsman.

685
01:01:08,144 --> 01:01:10,137
(chuckles)

686
01:01:10,272 --> 01:01:13,522
Well, something has sure
started in my thinking,

687
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:19,106
and I don't know why we should go on
if you're just gonna end up dead.

688
01:01:20,448 --> 01:01:22,737
Whoa.

689
01:01:22,867 --> 01:01:27,660
Can we get down here
for a while and talk?

690
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:32,836
- Yeah. OK.
- You can make it?

691
01:02:05,535 --> 01:02:07,575
(distant singing)

692
01:02:15,545 --> 01:02:19,958
(Mounties) * When the trumpet of the Lord
shall sound and time shall be no more

693
01:02:20,091 --> 01:02:24,006
* And the morning breaks
eternal, bright and fair

694
01:02:24,137 --> 01:02:28,087
* And the chosen ones shall gather
over on the other shore

695
01:02:28,224 --> 01:02:32,352
* And the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

696
01:02:32,479 --> 01:02:36,726
* When the roll is called up yonder

697
01:02:36,858 --> 01:02:41,152
* When the roll is called up yonder...

698
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:45,324
Now they've locked in with Jesus.
Let's do it.

699
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:51,654
- Makes me feel real safe and peaceful.
- Well, that's what Sundays are for.

700
01:03:39,003 --> 01:03:42,419
(Mounties sing
"Bringing In the Sheaves")

701
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,716
For the best police in the world,
Mounties are dumber than sticks.

702
01:04:28,845 --> 01:04:30,422
We just left 'em nothin'.

703
01:04:30,555 --> 01:04:32,761
Ha-ha! Whoo!

704
01:04:38,271 --> 01:04:40,310
(scraping)

705
01:04:52,869 --> 01:04:55,360
Damn.

706
01:04:55,497 --> 01:04:59,280
Shouldn't crawl up on people like that.

707
01:04:59,417 --> 01:05:02,667
Well, I'm not the crawlin' kind.

708
01:05:02,795 --> 01:05:07,623
I was just passin' by and I thought
I'd ask you a question or two.

709
01:05:07,759 --> 01:05:12,136
There was a family of Logans
out of Kaycee, Wyoming.

710
01:05:12,263 --> 01:05:15,632
There was four brothers.
The youngest was a kid named Lonnie.

711
01:05:15,767 --> 01:05:17,925
They was all pretty quick,

712
01:05:18,061 --> 01:05:20,765
except for Lonnie -
he was a fiddle player, and...

713
01:05:20,897 --> 01:05:23,352
They killed him off right quick.

714
01:05:23,483 --> 01:05:27,148
Some of the ranchers had found him
thievin' or something like that.

715
01:05:27,278 --> 01:05:31,940
Anyway, I was wonderin'...
would they be kin to ya?

716
01:05:32,075 --> 01:05:33,948
No. No.

717
01:05:34,077 --> 01:05:38,537
Well, I didn't think so
because you don't carry a gun.

718
01:05:38,665 --> 01:05:40,704
No, I never carry a gun.

719
01:05:43,378 --> 01:05:45,454
I never wear a gun neither.

720
01:05:45,588 --> 01:05:50,215
Oh, once in a while I carry
this little darlin' around.

721
01:05:50,343 --> 01:05:54,804
She's almost like a poem.
You know, it's all hand-done.

722
01:05:54,931 --> 01:05:57,256
Etched, you know, scratched in silver.

723
01:05:57,392 --> 01:06:00,476
Oh, she's a beauty.
Made for the president of Mexico.

724
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:03,011
I diverted it for a hundred-dollar bill.

725
01:06:03,147 --> 01:06:06,018
But it doesn't shoot worth a damn.

726
01:06:07,902 --> 01:06:13,489
Some damn fool came along
and filed off the top of the front sight.

727
01:06:15,994 --> 01:06:19,327
And you have to sort of play with it.

728
01:06:23,585 --> 01:06:25,791
It isn't easy.

729
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,245
Have a look at the rope.

730
01:06:32,635 --> 01:06:34,094
Not bad.

731
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,260
There's one left.

732
01:06:44,689 --> 01:06:46,728
I doubt it.

733
01:07:05,209 --> 01:07:07,249
You're smart.

734
01:07:09,547 --> 01:07:11,587
Farmers ain't smart.

735
01:07:11,716 --> 01:07:15,251
I don't know exactly where you came
from or what you were doing,

736
01:07:15,386 --> 01:07:21,471
but I think you ought to go back to it,
because you can't farm worth spit.

737
01:07:25,438 --> 01:07:29,103
Unless... unless you lost your nerve.

738
01:07:30,109 --> 01:07:34,855
In that case, cabbages
is just what the doctor ordered.

739
01:07:42,038 --> 01:07:45,371
Is your nerve gone?

740
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,955
(sings) Is your nerve gone?

741
01:07:51,547 --> 01:07:53,587
Yah!

742
01:07:56,135 --> 01:07:58,175
Easy, easy!

743
01:08:02,517 --> 01:08:06,217
We're home, boys. We'll bed down soon.

744
01:08:06,354 --> 01:08:09,023
How we gonna get 'em
to swim across the Mighty Mo?

745
01:08:09,148 --> 01:08:12,066
If you can get one or two to go,
they'll all go.

746
01:08:12,193 --> 01:08:15,277
Here's the breaks. Come on!

747
01:08:15,405 --> 01:08:18,156
Back in the USA! What a relief.

748
01:08:22,453 --> 01:08:23,698
Hey!

749
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:26,370
Slow, boys.

750
01:08:28,918 --> 01:08:30,709
(gunshot)

751
01:08:30,837 --> 01:08:32,295
Mounties!

752
01:08:34,215 --> 01:08:36,920
Come on. Let's get outta here.

753
01:08:37,051 --> 01:08:38,925
Get down.

754
01:08:41,305 --> 01:08:43,179
Let's get outta here.

755
01:08:44,976 --> 01:08:47,015
Come on! Yah! Yah!

756
01:08:50,898 --> 01:08:53,021
(gunshot)

757
01:08:55,111 --> 01:08:56,771
Agh!

758
01:09:03,077 --> 01:09:05,117
Let's go! Let's go!

759
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:41,653
Wonder where Little Tod
got himself off to.

760
01:09:43,201 --> 01:09:45,240
I don't know.

761
01:09:46,537 --> 01:09:49,657
I don't know where my finger is either.

762
01:09:50,249 --> 01:09:56,204
Them Mounties... followed us
right into the United States of America,

763
01:09:56,339 --> 01:09:58,378
got their horses back.

764
01:09:59,592 --> 01:10:02,000
It's not even legal!

765
01:10:03,304 --> 01:10:09,508
Tie that hand up and let's move. Maybe
we'll meet Little Tod at the Snake's Cross.

766
01:10:11,437 --> 01:10:13,311
(yells)

767
01:10:31,249 --> 01:10:33,288
(squawks)

768
01:11:34,604 --> 01:11:36,477
Come on.

769
01:11:36,606 --> 01:11:38,645
Come on. Go! Go!

770
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:39,332
Whoa, there.

771
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:41,453
(laughs)

772
01:12:45,174 --> 01:12:48,258
Do you always get off
your horse that way?

773
01:12:50,388 --> 01:12:53,175
I'm not chasin' you.

774
01:12:53,307 --> 01:12:57,720
- Who did you think was after you?
- This is the haunt of thieves and killers.

775
01:12:57,853 --> 01:13:00,095
Oh, shit. Here.

776
01:13:00,898 --> 01:13:06,983
This ain't the haunt of nothin' but
diamondbacks and old farts like me.

777
01:13:07,947 --> 01:13:11,695
- Who are ya?
- My name's Jim Ferguson.

778
01:13:12,702 --> 01:13:15,323
I'm pleased to meet you.
What's your name?

779
01:13:15,454 --> 01:13:17,411
Tod La Frambois.

780
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,579
La Frambois.

781
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,578
- What's your trade, Mr La Frambois?
- Trade?

782
01:13:24,714 --> 01:13:29,091
Well, I been in the...
farm implement business.

783
01:13:29,218 --> 01:13:34,557
Now I'm lookin' to get on with the ranch.
Maybe down around Absaroka.

784
01:13:35,266 --> 01:13:37,721
That'd be over that way.

785
01:13:43,607 --> 01:13:48,020
I tell you what. I got a nice hare
on a stick over here.

786
01:13:50,156 --> 01:13:52,195
Let's go have a bite to eat.

787
01:13:52,324 --> 01:13:54,994
- Well... thank you.
- Come on.

788
01:14:02,543 --> 01:14:04,583
(strums mandolin)

789
01:14:05,963 --> 01:14:11,966
* Life is like a mountain railway

790
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:18,972
* With an engineer that's brave

791
01:14:19,894 --> 01:14:26,513
* We must make this run successful

792
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:33,697
* From the cradle to the grave

793
01:14:33,824 --> 01:14:40,574
* Heed the curves, the fills, the tunnels

794
01:14:40,706 --> 01:14:45,949
* Never falter, never quail

795
01:14:46,086 --> 01:14:47,960
Never quail.

796
01:14:48,088 --> 01:14:54,257
* Keep your hand upon the throttle

797
01:14:54,386 --> 01:15:00,840
* And your eye upon the rail

798
01:15:02,978 --> 01:15:05,220
- Sweet song.
- Yeah.

799
01:15:07,566 --> 01:15:12,940
Do you believe that life is like
a mountain railroad, Mr La Frambois?

800
01:15:14,281 --> 01:15:17,366
All I know, Jim, is that...

801
01:15:17,493 --> 01:15:20,944
life is not like anything I ever seen before.

802
01:15:22,873 --> 01:15:24,913
Yes.

803
01:15:26,961 --> 01:15:32,251
It's really strange runnin' into a preacher
out here, in this hellhole.

804
01:15:32,967 --> 01:15:37,510
I believe that life is
like a mountain railway,

805
01:15:37,638 --> 01:15:41,089
but not for the reasons in the song.

806
01:15:41,934 --> 01:15:44,342
I think life is like a mountain railway

807
01:15:44,478 --> 01:15:49,983
cos you don't have no idea what sleazy
son of a bitch got his hand on the throttle.

808
01:15:50,109 --> 01:15:53,941
That's a real strange attitude
for a preacher.

809
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,691
Yep.

810
01:16:00,828 --> 01:16:03,283
I ain't no preacher.

811
01:16:09,128 --> 01:16:10,919
What do you do?

812
01:16:11,046 --> 01:16:14,961
I'm about a quarter-ass horse thief.

813
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:18,543
Anything to get some grits in my stomach.

814
01:16:18,679 --> 01:16:21,431
Not doin' too good at it neither.

815
01:16:21,557 --> 01:16:24,926
Otherwise I wouldn't be eatin' hare.

816
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:27,516
I'd be in Dodge City,

817
01:16:27,646 --> 01:16:31,478
playin' with them big asses,
drinkin' champagne.

818
01:16:32,693 --> 01:16:34,021
(chuckles)

819
01:16:34,153 --> 01:16:37,688
What about yourself there, Tod?

820
01:16:37,823 --> 01:16:39,816
What do you do?

821
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:45,989
Well, there's really nothin' to say.
I'm a single man. Implement business.

822
01:16:48,459 --> 01:16:52,326
- Where you got this implement business?
- It's in Big Sandy.

823
01:16:52,463 --> 01:16:55,036
No, I mean the Shonkin Sag.

824
01:16:55,174 --> 01:16:57,925
- No, I mean Big Sandy. Big...
- (laughs)

825
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:04,015
I was raised up in Big Sandy.

826
01:17:04,141 --> 01:17:08,470
There ain't a teeny-weeny
implement business in Big Sandy,

827
01:17:08,604 --> 01:17:11,273
and not in Shonkin Sag neither.

828
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:18,686
Mr Ferguson, I'm really grateful to you
for your hospitality and everything,

829
01:17:18,822 --> 01:17:21,942
but my line of work is
none of your damn business.

830
01:17:22,076 --> 01:17:26,654
I'm sorry, Tod. I didn't mean
to get you all riled up like that.

831
01:17:26,789 --> 01:17:29,161
I'll tell you what.

832
01:17:29,291 --> 01:17:34,202
Maybe one of these days, I'll get
a chance to cook your supper for you.

833
01:17:34,338 --> 01:17:37,921
Hah! Hooray for a free dang meal.

834
01:17:40,094 --> 01:17:41,374
Good.

835
01:17:41,512 --> 01:17:43,551
Thank God.

836
01:17:49,228 --> 01:17:51,849
I hope you keep my business
to yourself too.

837
01:17:51,981 --> 01:17:54,269
Hey. You got my word.

838
01:17:55,275 --> 01:17:57,813
That's good enough. (hums)

839
01:18:25,222 --> 01:18:27,760
(snoring)

840
01:18:43,741 --> 01:18:47,110
What the hell's goin' on here?

841
01:18:47,244 --> 01:18:50,993
Goddamn. What the hell's
the matter with you?

842
01:18:51,123 --> 01:18:54,456
Something... I don't know...

843
01:18:54,585 --> 01:18:57,372
Tryin' to get some sleep here.

844
01:19:09,266 --> 01:19:12,635
I want you to cinch up good
on the knot there.

845
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:15,806
- Yeah, I did.
- All right, now don't have fear.

846
01:19:15,939 --> 01:19:18,810
This is the way my daddy taught me, now.

847
01:19:21,278 --> 01:19:24,314
Easy aces, now. Come on.

848
01:19:24,448 --> 01:19:26,690
Come on.

849
01:19:29,495 --> 01:19:33,243
- This is the part I hate. I can't swim a lick.
- Come on.

850
01:19:33,374 --> 01:19:35,413
- What do I do?
- Now slide off.

851
01:19:35,542 --> 01:19:39,243
Slide off. Let her go.
Let the horse go. Don't hold on.

852
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:42,215
- That's it. Now we're doin' it.
- Whoo-hoo!

853
01:19:42,341 --> 01:19:45,010
I got you now.

854
01:19:45,135 --> 01:19:47,175
Damn!

855
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:51,757
- Hell, this is easy.
- Up on that beast now.

856
01:19:53,435 --> 01:19:55,594
You're halfway to the barn now, laddie.

857
01:19:55,729 --> 01:19:58,267
- Halfway.
- Yee-hah!

858
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:01,767
Come on! We've cut that son of a bitch.

859
01:20:03,987 --> 01:20:07,072
We cut that goddamn thing
slicker than butter.

860
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:10,568
Listen, you go on ahead now.

861
01:20:10,702 --> 01:20:13,656
You go on over there
and I'll secure the rope here.

862
01:20:13,789 --> 01:20:16,078
- You got a good hold on that?
- Yeah.

863
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:21,712
You get goin' now, and then you pull me
in case something happens to me.

864
01:20:21,839 --> 01:20:23,878
Yah!

865
01:20:24,716 --> 01:20:26,674
Let her go now.

866
01:20:27,177 --> 01:20:29,217
I don't know about this.

867
01:20:31,765 --> 01:20:34,256
That's it. Go ahead.

868
01:20:34,393 --> 01:20:35,472
In you go.

869
01:20:35,602 --> 01:20:38,224
Damn horse won't swim. Come on.

870
01:20:38,355 --> 01:20:41,142
- Dig your heels in now.
- This isn't bad at all.

871
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:42,389
Yah!

872
01:20:43,277 --> 01:20:45,269
I can't swim. Bring me in.

873
01:20:45,404 --> 01:20:48,321
Now, you dirt turkey,
are you gonna talk to me?

874
01:20:48,449 --> 01:20:51,236
You gonna tell me somethin' now?

875
01:20:51,368 --> 01:20:56,196
Listen, son, you got two choices now.
Drink this muddy son of a bitch,

876
01:20:56,331 --> 01:20:59,285
or tell me about Tom Logan
and your goddamn rustlin'.

877
01:20:59,418 --> 01:21:01,825
You... You son...

878
01:21:01,962 --> 01:21:05,331
- I'm gonna give you one...
- I'm not gonna say anything.

879
01:21:05,466 --> 01:21:07,921
Mr La Frambois, one.

880
01:21:10,637 --> 01:21:11,800
Agh!

881
01:21:22,357 --> 01:21:24,599
Adios, amigo.

882
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:02,310
(neighs)

883
01:22:03,398 --> 01:22:05,474
That's Little Tod's horse.

884
01:22:05,609 --> 01:22:07,851
Damned if it ain't.

885
01:22:12,741 --> 01:22:15,944
What happened?
Did he get bucked off or what?

886
01:22:16,745 --> 01:22:18,785
- I don't know.
- Cal?

887
01:22:22,459 --> 01:22:25,626
- What is it?
- What the hell's goin' on?

888
01:22:25,754 --> 01:22:27,960
Let's get inside.

889
01:22:31,635 --> 01:22:35,549
- What's happening?
- Lee Clayton. Lee Clayton!

890
01:22:39,184 --> 01:22:43,597
Come here, Sandy, old girl.
We're goin' to a picnic.

891
01:22:46,692 --> 01:22:48,731
(Clayton whistling)

892
01:22:50,988 --> 01:22:52,779
He never will close that gate.

893
01:22:52,906 --> 01:22:56,489
It wasn't near as gloomy around here
when we only had rustlers.

894
01:22:56,618 --> 01:23:00,782
Never seen nothin' like him. Come on.

895
01:23:00,914 --> 01:23:04,912
Never thought Mr Braxton
would call in a man like that.

896
01:23:10,048 --> 01:23:12,088
(laughs)

897
01:23:14,928 --> 01:23:18,178
I presume you've had an enlightening trip.

898
01:23:18,307 --> 01:23:20,050
Mm...

899
01:23:21,476 --> 01:23:24,762
Well, what kind of trip did you have?

900
01:23:27,899 --> 01:23:30,437
What did you learn?

901
01:23:30,569 --> 01:23:36,405
Lower your voice. I feel an attack of gas
and that could be perilous to both of us.

902
01:23:36,533 --> 01:23:38,775
(farts) That's good.

903
01:23:42,998 --> 01:23:45,489
What did you learn?

904
01:23:48,211 --> 01:23:52,957
The one man that could have told me
something didn't tell me nothing,

905
01:23:53,091 --> 01:23:56,923
and then he upped and drowned himself
in the Missouri River.

906
01:23:58,722 --> 01:24:01,213
You've got no further
than we did without you.

907
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:05,299
Oh, I can track a bluebottle fly
right up your nose.

908
01:24:05,437 --> 01:24:09,304
And I've taken to trackin'
what people are thinkin'.

909
01:24:09,441 --> 01:24:11,766
Where's your wife?

910
01:24:11,902 --> 01:24:14,571
What has that got to... Damn it!

911
01:24:15,614 --> 01:24:18,069
I detest your impertinence.

912
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:22,826
You stay out of my private life,
you lilac-smellin' son of a bitch.

913
01:24:24,748 --> 01:24:28,366
You ain't the first mental wizard
I ever met, you know.

914
01:24:28,502 --> 01:24:32,036
I've met ranchers, outlaws,
stock detectives

915
01:24:32,172 --> 01:24:36,039
who thought they was
mental wizards like yourself.

916
01:24:36,176 --> 01:24:40,387
There was one thing I could
never understand and that was...

917
01:24:40,514 --> 01:24:43,799
"Why can't they hang on to their women?"

918
01:24:43,934 --> 01:24:47,766
You're beginning to rave.
And you're beginning to bore me.

919
01:24:47,896 --> 01:24:49,972
So you're gonna stop.

920
01:24:50,107 --> 01:24:53,061
You're gonna stop spying on me
and on my family.

921
01:24:53,193 --> 01:24:55,482
You were never hired to do that.

922
01:24:55,612 --> 01:24:58,020
I do not, and Jane does not,

923
01:24:58,156 --> 01:25:01,988
and the dozen dolts who work for me
do not steal horses.

924
01:25:04,121 --> 01:25:07,157
But somebody does, don't he?

925
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:22,260
(hoof beats)

926
01:25:29,563 --> 01:25:33,014
Well, there's a sight for sore eyes.

927
01:25:34,109 --> 01:25:36,018
- Cal!
- Long time, Logan.

928
01:25:36,153 --> 01:25:40,233
Cal, I want you to meet
a good friend of mine. Jane Braxton.

929
01:25:40,365 --> 01:25:43,651
- How do?
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

930
01:25:43,785 --> 01:25:47,119
She was born and bred here, Cal,
and ready for city lights.

931
01:25:47,247 --> 01:25:50,581
Pretty ladies should have what they want.

932
01:25:50,709 --> 01:25:53,994
- How's the ranch comin', Tom?
- You want a tour?

933
01:25:55,547 --> 01:25:58,038
Sure do.

934
01:25:58,175 --> 01:26:00,630
I'll see you later. Bye.

935
01:26:11,271 --> 01:26:14,889
Cal, come on, I'll show you the orchard.
Come on, buddy.

936
01:26:15,025 --> 01:26:18,725
This little bastard was
in sorry shape before I got to it.

937
01:26:18,862 --> 01:26:23,607
These trees wouldn't have turned out
a peck of apples apiece.

938
01:26:23,742 --> 01:26:28,320
No wonder that guy's makin' barrels in
town. He wasn't running this place right.

939
01:26:28,455 --> 01:26:31,372
This tree was all full of scale and blight.

940
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:37,869
These limbs I dug out of here had borers
in 'em and insect eggs all over everything.

941
01:26:38,006 --> 01:26:39,833
It was...

942
01:26:42,344 --> 01:26:45,013
Little Tod didn't come home.

943
01:26:52,896 --> 01:26:55,019
What the hell are you doin'?

944
01:26:55,148 --> 01:27:01,233
What difference does it make whether
blight or borers eat up this whole ranch?

945
01:27:03,615 --> 01:27:06,284
Well, Cal, I just have to say it.

946
01:27:08,537 --> 01:27:11,822
I'd prefer that they didn't ruin the orchard.

947
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:26,466
Poor Little Tod.

948
01:27:44,197 --> 01:27:47,032
Gimme that cartridge.

949
01:27:51,204 --> 01:27:55,416
That girl's old man
hired Lee Clayton, didn't he?

950
01:27:57,586 --> 01:28:00,373
Yeah. He did.

951
01:28:00,505 --> 01:28:04,040
What about her? Where's her husband at?

952
01:28:04,175 --> 01:28:07,675
She don't have a husband.
She don't need one.

953
01:28:07,804 --> 01:28:10,556
She don't need one.

954
01:28:10,682 --> 01:28:14,217
Boy, you're pretty far gone, ain't ya?

955
01:28:14,352 --> 01:28:19,726
- It's the way it happens, isn't it, Cal?
- I wouldn't know.

956
01:28:19,858 --> 01:28:23,606
Not since that dog of mine
put his tongue on the butter.

957
01:28:45,383 --> 01:28:47,423
Where's Lee Clayton? Is he here?

958
01:28:47,552 --> 01:28:51,881
You betcha. Moved right in.
Made himself at home. Boy!

959
01:28:54,893 --> 01:28:56,932
Robert Lee?

960
01:29:10,825 --> 01:29:13,281
(Clayton singing)

961
01:29:21,586 --> 01:29:23,828
Robert Lee.

962
01:29:28,426 --> 01:29:33,551
You know, the old man built this tub
for the old lady, and she ran out on him.

963
01:29:33,682 --> 01:29:36,848
Wasn't that you callin' me out there?

964
01:29:36,976 --> 01:29:39,514
Yes, son. That was me.

965
01:29:39,646 --> 01:29:42,433
There's no way you can win, you know.

966
01:29:42,565 --> 01:29:43,597
What?

967
01:29:43,733 --> 01:29:45,560
- There's no way you can win.
- Win?

968
01:29:45,694 --> 01:29:49,394
It's kin of mine is all
that calls me Robert Lee.

969
01:29:49,531 --> 01:29:51,856
I'm going to bust your fat ass.

970
01:29:53,743 --> 01:29:58,121
How am I to get my nourishment
spending my dinner hour here with you?

971
01:29:58,248 --> 01:30:03,289
You ain't gonna get no nourishment.
You're gonna dry up and blow away.

972
01:30:08,466 --> 01:30:11,136
It just ain't in the cards, angel.

973
01:30:11,261 --> 01:30:14,760
Can't you see that the list
is as long as my arm?

974
01:30:14,889 --> 01:30:17,380
You're under the headin'
of what I do for a livin'.

975
01:30:17,517 --> 01:30:21,811
Now step outside, because
my stomach has commenced to growl.

976
01:30:23,565 --> 01:30:25,604
Are you scared?

977
01:30:27,652 --> 01:30:29,894
Shakin' all over.

978
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:33,315
It's almost like I don't have a prayer.

979
01:30:34,367 --> 01:30:36,905
But I can't lose this appetite.
What ails me?

980
01:30:37,037 --> 01:30:41,829
You're floatin' there in your confirmation
dress waitin' for God to save ya.

981
01:30:41,958 --> 01:30:46,003
Did it ever bother you, sittin' up there
in that cabin drinkin' coffee,

982
01:30:46,129 --> 01:30:50,672
while that fiddler's wife
was screamin' in the Sandwash?

983
01:30:52,552 --> 01:30:56,632
Well, first off... I don't drink coffee.

984
01:30:56,765 --> 01:30:59,765
Now can I climb out?
I'm hungry for my supper.

985
01:30:59,893 --> 01:31:03,143
Where's your Creedmore at, Robert Lee?

986
01:31:03,271 --> 01:31:07,399
Where's your cabbage-shootin' Mexican
pistola with flowers on the handle?

987
01:31:07,525 --> 01:31:10,360
Why don't you go get it?

988
01:31:11,446 --> 01:31:13,984
That settles it.

989
01:31:14,115 --> 01:31:15,989
I'm not that hungry

990
01:31:16,117 --> 01:31:21,028
and I'll stay here till someone fetches me
who cares about my welfare.

991
01:31:21,164 --> 01:31:24,782
- I deplore...
- Get up, you dry-gulchin' piece of slime.

992
01:31:24,918 --> 01:31:27,041
A little bathe in the tub here...

993
01:31:27,170 --> 01:31:28,794
Get up!

994
01:31:29,297 --> 01:31:31,206
Get up!

995
01:31:31,341 --> 01:31:35,552
I want to lie here and lose.
No dinner. No nothing.

996
01:31:41,518 --> 01:31:43,095
Well?

997
01:31:57,951 --> 01:31:58,946
(gunshot)

998
01:31:59,077 --> 01:32:01,698
(water dripping)

999
01:32:08,628 --> 01:32:11,000
My God. You ain't even there.

1000
01:32:37,532 --> 01:32:39,571
Did you kill him?

1001
01:32:39,701 --> 01:32:46,071
No, I just emptied his tub. Somebody's
gonna have to do something about that.

1002
01:33:04,642 --> 01:33:06,682
What's become of Tom?

1003
01:33:08,521 --> 01:33:11,558
- Isn't he on his place?
- No, he's not.

1004
01:33:11,691 --> 01:33:16,317
Well, that's not what I call ranching.
I know what you're driving at.

1005
01:33:16,446 --> 01:33:20,443
All I can tell you is that things have
been nearly as bad as they could be.

1006
01:33:20,575 --> 01:33:24,620
If those two men have reason to look
for one another, I'm not interfering.

1007
01:33:24,746 --> 01:33:27,237
You find Lee Clayton and you stop him.

1008
01:33:27,373 --> 01:33:28,951
No.

1009
01:33:29,083 --> 01:33:31,574
You can't.

1010
01:33:31,711 --> 01:33:33,668
I won't.

1011
01:33:34,464 --> 01:33:37,584
I hope that you choke on that.

1012
01:33:40,345 --> 01:33:43,180
You don't mean that, darling.

1013
01:33:44,349 --> 01:33:46,590
- Vern, scat.
- You betcha.

1014
01:33:47,977 --> 01:33:51,180
I wouldn't have hired Lee
if the rustlers hadn't killed Pete.

1015
01:33:51,314 --> 01:33:54,434
This has nothing to do with Pete,
law, or stealing horses.

1016
01:33:54,567 --> 01:33:57,687
- Then what does it have to do with?
- Tom Logan.

1017
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:00,146
Tom Logan.

1018
01:34:01,282 --> 01:34:06,240
- I never even think about him.
- You can't bear me being with him.

1019
01:34:06,371 --> 01:34:11,911
Now, Daddy, goddamn it.
You find Lee Clayton and you stop him!

1020
01:34:12,043 --> 01:34:16,621
You think I couldn't bear living here alone,
don't you? Start me thinking.

1021
01:34:16,756 --> 01:34:18,796
No... No.

1022
01:34:20,176 --> 01:34:22,797
No, I won't. I won't.

1023
01:34:26,474 --> 01:34:29,641
- (horse snorts)
- (Logan) Whoa, Buck.

1024
01:34:29,769 --> 01:34:32,474
- Oh...
- What the hell are you doin'?

1025
01:34:32,605 --> 01:34:37,979
- Cal's got me lookin' out for Lee Clayton.
- Come on down. Old Buck come up lame.

1026
01:34:38,111 --> 01:34:42,322
Gimme a hand. Goddamn it.
Easy, Buck. Come on now.

1027
01:34:43,157 --> 01:34:47,202
Only goddamn intelligent horse.
Easy, boy.

1028
01:34:48,705 --> 01:34:50,744
I had him.

1029
01:34:56,421 --> 01:35:02,126
You think anybody could do it?
I mean... an ordinary fella?

1030
01:35:06,014 --> 01:35:08,053
I don't know.

1031
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:15,268
Seems like somebody oughta
be able to get the job done.

1032
01:35:15,398 --> 01:35:17,853
Just watch it is all.

1033
01:35:20,862 --> 01:35:23,613
I'll tell you one thing, though.

1034
01:35:24,699 --> 01:35:26,738
Don't start talkin' to him.

1035
01:35:26,868 --> 01:35:30,237
I don't care what the plan is,
as long as you get us outta here.

1036
01:35:30,371 --> 01:35:35,080
That's what I'd like.
Let's just pull our socks up and get out.

1037
01:35:35,209 --> 01:35:37,961
We're gonna hit Braxton.

1038
01:35:38,087 --> 01:35:42,465
We're gonna take everything he's got.
Blooded stock an' all.

1039
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:46,210
- That's the least we can do.
- And maybe flush us a regulator.

1040
01:35:46,345 --> 01:35:49,263
I would love to include the old man.

1041
01:35:49,390 --> 01:35:52,095
A .44-40 in the brain
would be my sentence for him.

1042
01:35:52,226 --> 01:35:55,061
I don't know why you don't want
to go along with that.

1043
01:35:55,188 --> 01:35:56,598
I'd just sooner we didn't.

1044
01:35:56,731 --> 01:36:00,349
I wanna know on what grounds
you don't wanna shoot Braxton!

1045
01:36:00,485 --> 01:36:03,984
We ain't gonna do it
because I said we ain't gonna do it!

1046
01:36:05,948 --> 01:36:08,155
Am I perfectly clear on that, Cal?

1047
01:36:08,284 --> 01:36:10,953
Goddamn it, let's not start that stuff.

1048
01:36:11,079 --> 01:36:14,697
Really, Tom, it's only
gonna wreck the whole job.

1049
01:36:14,832 --> 01:36:16,872
Cal?

1050
01:36:29,806 --> 01:36:33,340
Hey, Woodruff.
Braxton got you nighthawking.

1051
01:36:33,476 --> 01:36:35,931
Mr Logan, what you doin'
out of bed at this hour?

1052
01:36:36,062 --> 01:36:40,688
Lookin' for a better life, Woodruff. What
do you know that's new and exciting?

1053
01:36:40,817 --> 01:36:44,945
- Same old thing.
- What do you got in here?

1054
01:36:45,071 --> 01:36:47,396
Oh...

1055
01:36:47,532 --> 01:36:48,694
37.

1056
01:36:48,825 --> 01:36:51,909
And I got the walkin' horse, but...

1057
01:36:52,995 --> 01:36:56,115
You're gonna take 'em.

1058
01:36:56,249 --> 01:36:59,618
You bet. You wanna get down now?

1059
01:36:59,752 --> 01:37:04,877
And reach me over that bird's head Colt
you got stuck in your shirt there.

1060
01:37:05,007 --> 01:37:08,174
Butt first, if you please, Woodruff.

1061
01:37:26,904 --> 01:37:32,278
- You think you're smart, don't you?
- Well, I ain't dumb and I ain't tied up.

1062
01:37:33,369 --> 01:37:35,575
You just lay on that soft spot.

1063
01:37:35,705 --> 01:37:39,405
- You're slicker than snot on a door knob.
- Thank you, Cary.

1064
01:37:44,547 --> 01:37:46,586
I tell you one goddamn thing.

1065
01:37:46,716 --> 01:37:52,588
Old Braxton's gonna be one
surprised-assed son of a bitch, ain't he?

1066
01:37:54,056 --> 01:37:59,561
I regret Pete Marker wasn't here
to get the news, that sorry bag of shit.

1067
01:37:59,687 --> 01:38:03,222
We'll see him in hell, that son of a bitch.

1068
01:38:03,357 --> 01:38:07,569
Shut up, Si, or you'll push these horses
all the way down to Kansas without us.

1069
01:38:07,695 --> 01:38:11,278
Let's push, boys. I feel eyes all over us.

1070
01:38:32,386 --> 01:38:36,799
That relay ranch is dead.
Anybody got a preferred district?

1071
01:38:36,933 --> 01:38:39,174
- Hellsgate for me.
- Big Hole.

1072
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:42,264
Big Hole. I'll meet you there. Cal?

1073
01:38:43,314 --> 01:38:45,887
Dodge Pole. Shit, that's all that's left.

1074
01:38:46,025 --> 01:38:49,061
- We'll meet back at the old cabin. Cary?
- All right.

1075
01:38:49,195 --> 01:38:53,608
Remember, I wanna get $20 a head
for these or we're doing this job...

1076
01:39:08,214 --> 01:39:12,675
I could have picked off one or two of them
maybe, but we'd have lost the rest.

1077
01:39:12,802 --> 01:39:18,507
Supposin' you had a barn full of nasty
old bats. You wanted to get rid of them.

1078
01:39:18,641 --> 01:39:23,517
The worst thing you could do is just
get your gun and start shootin' around.

1079
01:39:23,646 --> 01:39:25,852
What good would it do you?

1080
01:39:25,982 --> 01:39:29,185
They'd leave and they'd be back
by 7.30 in the morning.

1081
01:39:29,318 --> 01:39:33,530
If you want to get rid of a whole lot
of evil bats, there's only one way.

1082
01:39:33,656 --> 01:39:37,654
And the way is this.
You wait till the dawn comes.

1083
01:39:37,785 --> 01:39:41,368
About 4.30 and you're waitin'
outside by the barrels.

1084
01:39:41,497 --> 01:39:46,159
Then you close the door real quick
and all the bats are inside.

1085
01:39:46,294 --> 01:39:49,912
Then while they're sleepin',
the lovely little sweethearts,

1086
01:39:50,047 --> 01:39:53,499
you have every one of the dirty
little buggers at your mercy.

1087
01:39:53,634 --> 01:39:58,380
- That's the only way you can do it.
- That's all very informative.

1088
01:39:58,514 --> 01:40:00,970
But every horse I own is gone.

1089
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:04,765
The only way you're going
to get paid is if I get them back.

1090
01:40:04,895 --> 01:40:07,386
(laughs) Golly.

1091
01:40:07,523 --> 01:40:10,144
I don't care a damn about that. Come on.

1092
01:40:10,276 --> 01:40:12,315
Always finish the work.

1093
01:40:12,445 --> 01:40:17,237
And... I don't give a damn
whether or not I get paid.

1094
01:40:17,366 --> 01:40:23,451
And, uh... talkin' about horses, I think
I know the horse you're worrying about.

1095
01:40:23,581 --> 01:40:26,582
- He wears a black hat, he's two-legged...
- Shut up.

1096
01:40:26,709 --> 01:40:29,117
..and I think I know
where he stands at stud.

1097
01:40:29,253 --> 01:40:32,005
Shut up! You're out of control.
You're through.

1098
01:40:32,131 --> 01:40:34,456
I want you off the place. Now get!

1099
01:40:34,592 --> 01:40:37,593
Well, it is your place, sir.

1100
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:42,429
But the work is mine
and I'll have the say about that.

1101
01:40:42,558 --> 01:40:43,803
(sings)

1102
01:40:43,934 --> 01:40:46,556
Come on, Jess.
We know when we're not wanted.

1103
01:40:46,687 --> 01:40:49,854
Let's go out to the bat hunt now.

1104
01:40:49,982 --> 01:40:55,522
You lazy no-good bastards, get back
to work or I'll fire every one of you!

1105
01:41:04,497 --> 01:41:06,536
(bird call)

1106
01:41:13,047 --> 01:41:16,001
They call this country Hellsgate.

1107
01:41:18,094 --> 01:41:23,171
When my dad came in here, it was
nothing but a bunch of savage Indians...

1108
01:41:23,307 --> 01:41:25,347
and Jesuits.

1109
01:41:27,603 --> 01:41:33,523
Old Thomas Jefferson said that he was
a warrior so his son could be a farmer,

1110
01:41:33,651 --> 01:41:36,320
so his son could be a poet.

1111
01:41:39,782 --> 01:41:43,910
I raise cattle
so my son can be a merchant,

1112
01:41:44,036 --> 01:41:47,037
so his son can move to Newport,
Rhode Island, buy a sailboat

1113
01:41:47,164 --> 01:41:53,368
and never see one of these bastard-assed
son-of-a-bitchin' mountains again.

1114
01:41:56,424 --> 01:41:58,879
Who was Thomas Jefferson?

1115
01:42:02,012 --> 01:42:04,682
Guy back east.

1116
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:11,227
I'll bet you're about done in.
You had a long day.

1117
01:42:11,355 --> 01:42:13,182
That's true.

1118
01:42:13,315 --> 01:42:15,853
Mother, you wanna show
our boy the bunkhouse?

1119
01:42:15,985 --> 01:42:19,769
Surely. I'll bring him a blanket.

1120
01:42:21,532 --> 01:42:24,284
I'll see you before
you start out in the morning.

1121
01:42:24,410 --> 01:42:26,616
Fine.

1122
01:42:26,746 --> 01:42:29,830
Let me thank you again
for selling me those horses.

1123
01:42:29,957 --> 01:42:31,997
It's my pleasure.

1124
01:42:33,043 --> 01:42:36,578
My compliments to the artist
that changed those brands.

1125
01:42:36,714 --> 01:42:39,003
Was it you?

1126
01:42:40,634 --> 01:42:45,012
I learned it from a nice boy from
Newport, Rhode Island, with no sailboat.

1127
01:42:45,139 --> 01:42:50,595
They hung him in a cottonwood south of
the Shonkin Sag, by the neck, until dead.

1128
01:43:01,989 --> 01:43:04,860
- You've got five minutes.
- OK. Sh.

1129
01:43:06,035 --> 01:43:11,112
Wait. It would help if you got
out of your drawers altogether.

1130
01:43:11,248 --> 01:43:13,157
- No.
- Sh.

1131
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:18,001
- What good is it keepin' them on one leg?
- Why don't you shut up?

1132
01:43:19,089 --> 01:43:22,672
You've only got four of your minutes left.

1133
01:43:25,429 --> 01:43:28,715
Besides, I'm beginning to chafe.

1134
01:43:31,101 --> 01:43:32,928
Agh!

1135
01:43:33,771 --> 01:43:36,013
(screams)

1136
01:43:37,858 --> 01:43:41,726
- Hon? Honey?
- (continues screaming)

1137
01:43:53,165 --> 01:43:55,205
(distant explosion)

1138
01:44:15,563 --> 01:44:18,136
Kid. Hey, kid.

1139
01:44:18,274 --> 01:44:21,310
Here's a buck. Go get me a whiskey
and the rest is yours.

1140
01:44:21,443 --> 01:44:24,978
- Good stuff. Go on. Hurry up.
- (distant explosion)

1141
01:44:28,325 --> 01:44:30,282
Hurry up.

1142
01:44:34,790 --> 01:44:37,198
Thanks.

1143
01:45:01,817 --> 01:45:03,857
Hold these, junior.

1144
01:45:05,863 --> 01:45:09,232
I won't be but a minute,
then we'll go get something to eat.

1145
01:45:19,376 --> 01:45:21,416
Hey!

1146
01:45:25,007 --> 01:45:27,961
Hey! Hey!

1147
01:45:32,723 --> 01:45:34,347
Hey!

1148
01:45:37,645 --> 01:45:39,602
Hey! Hey!

1149
01:45:52,952 --> 01:45:55,822
I ain't got but $54, mister.

1150
01:45:55,954 --> 01:45:59,240
But I want all three horses or nothing.

1151
01:46:01,251 --> 01:46:03,493
What you got to trade?

1152
01:46:05,297 --> 01:46:07,337
A clarinet. (laughs)

1153
01:46:13,472 --> 01:46:16,307
All right, I'll take it.

1154
01:47:03,814 --> 01:47:05,853
(puffing)

1155
01:47:06,859 --> 01:47:08,898
(squeaky notes)

1156
01:47:36,013 --> 01:47:38,883
I can't use it. It looks too tight.

1157
01:47:43,771 --> 01:47:46,937
Here. Let me try it on.

1158
01:47:48,442 --> 01:47:52,025
Put your arm in. You can't tell till it's on.

1159
01:47:52,154 --> 01:47:54,692
Oh, it fits...

1160
01:47:55,324 --> 01:47:57,993
I don't want the goddamn thing.

1161
01:48:42,621 --> 01:48:44,946
(neighing)

1162
01:48:46,458 --> 01:48:48,581
(laughs)

1163
01:49:02,015 --> 01:49:04,055
Smoked meat!

1164
01:49:15,404 --> 01:49:17,895
(groans)

1165
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:25,950
Old smoked meat.

1166
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:35,836
Where's Tom Logan?

1167
01:49:43,932 --> 01:49:47,099
I couldn't get him to come out.

1168
01:49:47,227 --> 01:49:49,267
God!

1169
01:49:52,983 --> 01:49:55,770
Too proud, huh?

1170
01:49:56,737 --> 01:49:58,776
I reckon.

1171
01:50:04,828 --> 01:50:06,702
(crashing)

1172
01:50:08,832 --> 01:50:12,450
I'd like about anything
but getting burned up.

1173
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:30,811
Well, you're about
the last of your kind, old man.

1174
01:50:33,190 --> 01:50:36,475
If I was a better businessman
than I am a manhunter,

1175
01:50:36,610 --> 01:50:39,279
I'd put you in the circus.

1176
01:50:49,206 --> 01:50:54,496
You know, about this time of year -
Indian summer - gettin' there...

1177
01:50:54,628 --> 01:50:57,878
they say you can see
the Star of Bethlehem,

1178
01:50:58,006 --> 01:51:00,711
if you look real good.

1179
01:51:00,842 --> 01:51:06,596
I seen it once or twice. But you gotta look
away and then you gotta look at it, see?

1180
01:51:06,723 --> 01:51:10,555
You gotta look at it
just a minute, like that, see?

1181
01:51:13,021 --> 01:51:15,512
See what I mean?

1182
01:51:39,047 --> 01:51:43,377
Well, old Granny's gettin' tired now.

1183
01:51:52,477 --> 01:51:54,517
(Clayton singing)

1184
01:52:44,654 --> 01:52:46,197
(neighing)

1185
01:52:51,328 --> 01:52:53,367
Cal?

1186
01:52:58,085 --> 01:53:00,124
Si?

1187
01:53:14,434 --> 01:53:17,186
Oh... Oh...

1188
01:53:19,731 --> 01:53:22,103
Oh, my God.

1189
01:54:17,789 --> 01:54:18,904
(kisses)

1190
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:21,080
No. Kiss first.

1191
01:54:22,294 --> 01:54:24,333
Kiss first.

1192
01:54:29,509 --> 01:54:32,261
You have the lips of Salome,

1193
01:54:32,387 --> 01:54:34,843
and the eyes of Cleopatra.

1194
01:54:40,061 --> 01:54:42,101
(humming)

1195
01:54:44,191 --> 01:54:46,017
(plays harmonica)

1196
01:54:47,569 --> 01:54:52,527
I dedicate this song
to the only woman I ever loved.

1197
01:54:55,911 --> 01:54:59,955
I'm too shy to turn around
and say it to your face,

1198
01:55:00,081 --> 01:55:03,166
but I mean it from my heart.

1199
01:55:03,293 --> 01:55:05,582
I don't love you, you harlot.

1200
01:55:05,712 --> 01:55:09,626
I'm not even speaking to you.
Do you know that?

1201
01:55:12,761 --> 01:55:15,466
Come on. Would you?

1202
01:55:17,807 --> 01:55:22,434
That for you, and your disloyalty
and your treachery.

1203
01:55:23,813 --> 01:55:25,853
Dear heart.

1204
01:55:31,071 --> 01:55:33,110
(mumbles)

1205
01:55:40,413 --> 01:55:43,747
Grandma... Grandma.

1206
01:55:47,629 --> 01:55:50,914
Say good night to Granny.

1207
01:55:51,049 --> 01:55:53,801
I'll play you a tune.

1208
01:56:01,268 --> 01:56:03,307
(horse urinates)

1209
01:56:10,944 --> 01:56:14,562
Well, that's a fine thing.

1210
01:56:14,698 --> 01:56:19,194
You've pissed right in the middle
of my love song.

1211
01:56:19,327 --> 01:56:20,323
(laughs)

1212
01:56:20,453 --> 01:56:23,075
God! Pissin' over my song.

1213
01:56:41,725 --> 01:56:43,764
Well...

1214
01:57:10,628 --> 01:57:13,464
(gasps)

1215
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:16,460
(Logan) You know what woke you up?

1216
01:57:18,553 --> 01:57:21,720
Lee, you just had your throat cut.

1217
01:57:52,712 --> 01:57:55,250
(footsteps)

1218
01:58:00,762 --> 01:58:03,051
Where is he?

1219
01:58:21,491 --> 01:58:24,362
He's in there.

1220
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:41,635
All the rest of the hands left
a couple of days ago except for Vern.

1221
01:58:41,761 --> 01:58:46,008
- I'm stayin'. You betcha.
- It's all right, Vern.

1222
01:58:49,436 --> 01:58:55,770
I told him I was leaving last night
and he... sort of came unravelled.

1223
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:59,067
He's just lost himself.

1224
01:59:01,072 --> 01:59:04,109
Well, all I can say is
he'd better leave the room,

1225
01:59:04,242 --> 01:59:07,159
cos I'm gonna do it regardless.

1226
01:59:07,287 --> 01:59:10,572
Get out of the way, Vern.
You recognise this?

1227
01:59:12,292 --> 01:59:16,040
- You recognise it?
- (Vern) No. No.

1228
01:59:16,171 --> 01:59:18,709
Please, don't shoot him.

1229
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:21,757
What are you caterwauling about, Vern?

1230
01:59:21,885 --> 01:59:24,091
Get out of the way
before I put one into you.

1231
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:27,387
You might as well. He's all I got. No...

1232
01:59:28,558 --> 01:59:31,642
He's all I have. He's all I have.

1233
01:59:31,769 --> 01:59:34,557
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Shoot me.

1234
01:59:36,191 --> 01:59:38,646
(Vern) Shoot me. Yes, shoot me.

1235
01:59:40,862 --> 01:59:43,946
- Praise the Lord.
- Get out! Get that son of a bitch away.

1236
01:59:44,073 --> 01:59:48,202
- Vern, will you get away?
- I will. You betcha.

1237
01:59:50,622 --> 01:59:52,863
- I'm sorry, Tom.
- What for?

1238
01:59:53,917 --> 01:59:56,586
For everything.

1239
01:59:59,422 --> 02:00:01,664
Your friends, are they...

1240
02:00:04,552 --> 02:00:06,592
Yeah.

1241
02:00:13,394 --> 02:00:15,434
If...

1242
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:21,901
What were you gonna do? Just take off?

1243
02:00:22,028 --> 02:00:23,191
Yes.

1244
02:00:25,865 --> 02:00:28,950
What'd you expect?

1245
02:00:29,077 --> 02:00:31,200
To see you, for one thing.

1246
02:00:35,792 --> 02:00:38,828
- Did you think I'd be above ground?
- Well, of course.

1247
02:00:38,962 --> 02:00:43,505
- Why "of course"?
- Because I just can't imagine you dead.

1248
02:00:44,551 --> 02:00:47,754
My God, are you gonna make me say it?

1249
02:00:51,057 --> 02:00:52,172
Tom!

1250
02:01:07,282 --> 02:01:09,986
(Vern moaning)

1251
02:01:42,650 --> 02:01:45,106
(buggy approaches)

1252
02:01:57,332 --> 02:02:00,001
You've just about done it, huh?

1253
02:02:01,252 --> 02:02:03,292
Yeah.

1254
02:02:05,673 --> 02:02:09,089
Well, I think I've found
a buyer for the ranch.

1255
02:02:09,218 --> 02:02:15,008
I'm going into Absaroka now
to see about it and find a place for Vern.

1256
02:02:16,726 --> 02:02:18,350
Well...

1257
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:21,560
I'm glad.

1258
02:02:23,524 --> 02:02:28,566
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
tryin' to get back at somebody.

1259
02:02:29,697 --> 02:02:31,737
Why'd you say that?

1260
02:02:33,409 --> 02:02:36,079
No reason.

1261
02:02:41,834 --> 02:02:44,456
Well, hell, neither do I.

1262
02:02:48,925 --> 02:02:56,090
Where do you think you'll be...
in about six months?

1263
02:02:58,142 --> 02:03:03,053
Well, if I was to guess,
I'd say north of the breaks.

1264
02:03:03,981 --> 02:03:06,188
There's the Little Rockies up there.

1265
02:03:06,317 --> 02:03:11,560
A lot of little valleys are supposed
to have water year round.

1266
02:03:13,783 --> 02:03:16,737
Sounds like a real good guess.
