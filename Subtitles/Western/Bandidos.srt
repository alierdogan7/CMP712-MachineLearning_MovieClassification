1
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:06,787
We are doing you a favour!

2
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,361
With this saddle, you wouldn't be able
to get far! We'll hold it for you!

3
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,753
Hey! My Saddle, give me my saddle,

4
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,299
you dirty rotten pigs!

5
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:18,201
Now you tell me where they get the idea
they can ride this train without payin'.

6
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,601
No! That gets taken
by the company for his ticket!

7
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,733
C'mon, make yourself useful.

8
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,513
Join me?

9
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,759
Hey! Where did you get this?
From some bathtub?

10
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,706
Hey! Sharpshooter!

11
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:08,109
Easy with those revolvers, We don't
want no accidents on this train.

12
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,184
My friends saw your show in Tucson;

13
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,586
says you're pretty good.

14
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,188
That's quite a shot.

15
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,128
There's more than one...

16
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,303
There's three of them.

17
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,990
Did I look at your ticket?.

18
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,351
How about showing me your ticket?.

19
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,612
Adelante, hombres!

20
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,977
Vamos! Anda, anda!

21
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:49,683
Vamos!

22
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,648
Hey!

23
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,754
Kramer, C'mon, fast!
Billy's waiting!

24
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,290
He'll just have to be
a little patient!

25
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,276
That hijo de perro,
he never miss, amigo!.

26
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,114
That's professional shooting,

27
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,451
Eh, we'll never get out with him there.
By tonight we must reach the Frontera.

28
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,719
Don't worry,

29
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:11,923
we'll leave someone behind to put
the sheriff on the wrong track.

30
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,828
And who will have to
stay and die, eh?

31
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,765
You!

32
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,637
Maybe you're fooling me, eh?

33
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,234
Yeah, you...

34
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,207
You and your men!

35
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,416
Precision shooting.

36
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,920
Hey, why do you want to
split up with my men, eh?.

37
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,625
Just to let you and
your men get away from here.

38
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,198
There's only one
who can shoot like that,

39
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,361
tell’ em to stop.

40
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,339
We work very good together, eh?

41
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,106
Tell ‘em to quit shooting.

42
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,443
Nuno, tell the men.

43
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,852
Hey! Muchachos, alto al fuego!

44
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,354
Martin,

45
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,525
I know it's you Martin,

46
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:23,894
come out!

47
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,729
It's Billy, Billy Kane!

48
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,033
They told me you were looking for me.

49
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,005
Well, here's your chance.

50
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,573
My men won't shoot. Come out!

51
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,130
I'm very pleased to see you
in the company of such gentleman.

52
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,907
Kill me, Billy,

53
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,603
or by God I'll kill you, believe me.

54
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,346
I'm afraid you'll lose!

55
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,191
Scared, teacher?.

56
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,440
You'd better kill me, Billy,

57
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:36,869
but do it quick. For your own good.

58
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,774
I guess I'd better,

59
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,605
because only beginners
leave witnesses,

60
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,917
I never do, ain't wise.

61
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:52,816
I don't like to have
my picture up on walls

62
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,353
and have people
shoot me in the back

63
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,227
to get a reward.

64
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,867
What' the matter? You trying
to find an excuse to kill me?.

65
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,775
You know damn well you don't have to
shoot me down to Stop me from talking.

66
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,374
You're afraid.
Sooner or later I'll get you!

67
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,988
You can get me any day you want to.

68
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,727
If you can still hold a gun.

69
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:57,285
We all go together now, eh Billy?.
You joke with me before.

70
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,517
I said you were staying!

71
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,250
You try to follow me

72
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,329
and I'll put a bullet in your head.

73
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,027
Come on.

74
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:06,990
VamoS!

75
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,964
Vamos Companeros,

76
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,839
Cabrones! Hijo de perro,
la puta que te pario.

77
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:20,469
Vamos, Companeros, vamos por aca!
Vamos!

78
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:35,088
They had wandered from their homeland

79
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:42,229
And life they hold to hind then

80
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:50,370
Now they sleep in peace forever
In their silence how they lie there

81
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:57,582
When the train was moving westward
When the fires of hope were burning

82
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:04,851
Their destiny has been unfolded
From this train there’s no returning

83
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:16,267
Cindy had a golden vision

84
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:23,364
She had danced but just a season

85
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:31,215
Now she dances with the angels
For they killed her without reason

86
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:38,783
When the train was moving westward
When the fires of hope were burning

87
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:46,263
Their destiny has been unfolded
From this train there’s no returning

88
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:57,170
They had pledged to each a new life

89
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:04,309
Riding hand in hand together

90
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:13,117
Now their fate has been decided
Hand in hand they'll ride forever

91
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,313
Everybody's invited,

92
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,392
Your attention please,

93
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,257
I'm about to present the great,
the fabulous Ricky Shot!

94
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:55,493
Yes! In person Ricky Shot!
You're all about to see

95
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,590
the incredible come true

96
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,693
when you see what he does to a target!

97
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:02,797
The very cowboy I saw ONE DAY
make a coward of JESSE JAMES!

98
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,843
The very cowboy who
managed to split the cords

99
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,379
that were tightly binding
his poor aged mother WHO WOULD DIE!

100
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,607
A moment later from a Navajo...

101
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,815
The cowboy who from the
distance of 500 feet actually shot

102
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,443
a hole thru a thin dime!

103
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,681
That's right folks!

104
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,690
You know I think
that punk can outdraw you!

105
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,554
It's a bet.

106
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,025
Why, I tell you there's no one
from the Atlantic to the Pacific,

107
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,655
...I assure you no one from
Mexico to Canada,

108
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,063
has been able to outdraw
the lad I bring you today.

109
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:33,628
I give you the incomparable 
Ricky Shot! Yeah!

110
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,835
You're all about to see
the great Ricky Shot,

111
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,005
shooting a plate in mid air

112
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,484
Thank you!

113
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,247
Hey, Champion!

114
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,059
Well you win.

115
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,025
Sure I win!
I'll buy us a drink. Come on.

116
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,094
Whisky!

117
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,072
These gunfighters are
getting fewer and fewer.

118
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,824
Swine, You filthy swine!

119
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,751
Get up out of there.

120
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,024
You sayin' that to me?.

121
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,191
You're a bunch cowards and swine
because you know I can't use a gun!

122
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,632
I don't need my gun!

123
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,403
I can still smash your face in,

124
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,986
Hey! Gary watch out
you don't hurt him!

125
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:46,026
You shouldn't do that.
It just ain't nice.

126
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:11,990
No, not the beans!

127
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,394
Go to hell!

128
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,429
I could have managed it alone.

129
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,873
Hey! You! This is for the damage

130
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,739
and for burying my friend out there.

131
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,728
Well, thanks.

132
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:26,827
Adios,

133
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:28,998
see you.

134
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,683
This is the third one
that's ended up like this.

135
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,583
The minute you say you're a gunfighter

136
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,023
there's always someone
that has to prove

137
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,064
that he's faster than you are.

138
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,003
But it wasn't like this a few years ago,
when I could still shoot a gun,

139
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,966
No one had the guts to challenge me.

140
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,909
I was the whole show.

141
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:12,573
Now that they've killed your boy,
what are you gonna do?.

142
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,776
Start all over.

143
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,423
It's too bad, I'm sorry.

144
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,019
Don't be sorry, It's waste of time.

145
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,098
Now I've got to worry about
finding myself another boy.

146
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,037
You got a strong thumb
and your fingers are quick,

147
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,739
How much's your work pay?.

148
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,910
Enough to live on.

149
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,612
I'll offer you thirty percent.

150
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,227
I want half.

151
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,430
It's a deal.

152
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,063
By the way,
you didn't introduce yourself.

153
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:08,835
What's your name?.

154
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,905
RICKY, RICKY Shot.

155
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,143
Gimme a hand,

156
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,988
Oh, one more thing, I never did ask
you. Are you any good with a pistol?

157
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,990
Enough to live on.

158
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,995
You wasted the shot,
that's not the center.

159
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,991
If you don't like loud noises,

160
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,186
you'll have to pick off that
fuse like the stem of a flower.

161
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,071
Whad’dya expect out of
these old things?.

162
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,753
You'll never learn if you
don't concentrate, got that?.

163
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,891
All right, I'll put it
where you can see it.

164
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,485
But if you miss this time, you'll
have to get yourself a new teacher.

165
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,404
I keep telling you to stand with
your feet further apart, dammit,

166
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:58,110
And put your left foot 12
inches behind the other one!

167
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,508
That's right.

168
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,354
Your arm's gotta be rigid,

169
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,016
rigid I said!

170
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,329
You gotta feel your blood
running from your shoulder right

171
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,796
thru the tip of your gun,

172
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,692
Thumb the same height
as the index finger,

173
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,935
Line up your sights
first then your target.

174
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,029
Fire!

175
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,511
Matter of luck.

176
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,884
I always said that six shooters are

177
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,316
good for killin'
chickens and Indians

178
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,117
but for the precision shootin'
ya' need dueling pistols.

179
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,498
Didn't go off.

180
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,569
You think I'm really a fool,
don't you?.

181
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,535
Hey, since when are you
smokin' my cigars?. Eh?.

182
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:18,893
Evenin' sheriff.

183
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,090
Howdy. What're you
doin' in these parts?.

184
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,099
Oh, just touching up some old props.

185
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,998
Got anything to eat?.

186
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,837
I'm afraid there's nothing
left but the hot coals.

187
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,599
You got some coffee?.

188
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,970
I think so,

189
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,065
Ricky!.

190
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,042
I see you made a catch.

191
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:39,641
He's one of the prisoners from Belltown.
Had quite a time catchin' him.

192
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,809
Was he able to get all of 'em?.

193
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:45,214
Nope, there's another one around,
but in time, we'll get him,

194
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,491
That coffee's not much
better than dirty water,

195
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:53,092
but it's all we've got.

196
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,763
At least it's hot.

197
00:23:56,067 --> 00:24:00,470
Haven't got our new tricks yet and
no one is willing to give us credit.

198
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,930
I've had it rough, too.

199
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,633
It's been days since
I've slept in a real bed

200
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,644
'cause we've been looking
for that fourth convict.

201
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,246
But he won't get far
without a horse.

202
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:16,347
Say Martin, you see a lot of
people traveling around.

203
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,613
Information like that pays good.

204
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:25,085
If you see any of these faces
come and tell me in, Belltown.

205
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,588
We'd better be going now.

206
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,271
Goodnight, sheriff.

207
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:35,695
Be seein' ya.

208
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,809
So...

209
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,490
you are the fourth convict.

210
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,315
What if I was?

211
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,395
You know,

212
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,022
I wouldn't mind getting
my hands on that reward...

213
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,637
Calm down.

214
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,330
To me.,,

215
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,237
you're just Ricky Shot.

216
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,232
Grab it.,,

217
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:51,877
Shoot at that.

218
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,647
All right, you can get down!

219
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,659
I'm looking for VIGONZA.

220
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,995
Hey! Martin.

221
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,733
Come over this way, he's in here.

222
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,213
Hey! Buenos dias, amigo.

223
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,775
I heard they killed
another one of your boys,

224
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,243
eh, those are bad people,

225
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,317
I've been seein' a lot of these
around in the last few weeks.

226
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,356
That can only mean that Billy Kane

227
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,261
and his gang are on their way
again toward Texas.

228
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,522
You wanna talk about it?.

229
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,025
Come in!

230
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,741
Artista!

231
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,283
Show me how good you are,

232
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,852
Who's Billy Kane?.

233
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:03,955
He's the one who put
the holes in the hands of your boss,

234
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:05,579
that's something you should know.

235
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,920
Why you think
he teach you to shoot, eh?

236
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:15,121
He must have two steady hands on the
day when Billy Kane comes home again.

237
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,477
Hey, artista, show me how you shoot.

238
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,147
If I don't have no audience
I don't feel like it.

239
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:38,345
You won't have one when you
have to challenge Billy Kane.

240
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:41,220
You'll die on that day, but all alone.

241
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,794
Because no one,
not even you can outdraw Billy Kane,

242
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:51,992
This is a very poor country,
si senor, muy pobre.

243
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:56,301
It makes life difficult
for us bandidos. Tortilla!

244
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,948
The people don't eat enough,,,

245
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:13,656
And our friend Billy Kane, He knows
there's not enough for both of us,

246
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:17,626
So I must get rid of him first.
Before he gets rid of me!

247
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:22,228
Who's gonna do it, Vigonza?. Who's gonna
be the man to face Billy Kane?. You?.

248
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,627
Now who's kidding who?.

249
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,401
Listen, you're nothing.

250
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,735
Only Ricky is quick
enough to take Billy Kane.

251
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,513
We wouldn't like it
if your boy is killed first,

252
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,982
It is very difficult to stay
alive around if you're a pistolero,

253
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,384
Why don't you make
a deal with us, Vigonza?

254
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:46,457
Just give me a small advance.
It's sort of an investment, that's all,..

255
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,523
To guarantee the
funeral of Billy Kane.

256
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,889
Well, only a few dollars,
how about it? Come on Vigonza.

257
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,492
No! You stupid old fool,
don't you understand?.

258
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,796
I don't need your help,
things are different now!

259
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:03,101
Yo soy un hombre importante!

260
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,767
Muy imortante!

261
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,984
I have a big band,

262
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,079
muchas women, money...

263
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:29,233
And Dinero is power,

264
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:35,032
As soon as Billy Kane has his foot
in my territorio, I will find him,

265
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:43,144
I'll know where, and when,

266
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,678
Subienas!

267
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,651
Give him a Sack of flour
and get him out of here!

268
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,881
Here we don't give nothing for nothing.

269
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,553
Come here an' see if you can win it,
If you can put this card on top

270
00:29:56,661 --> 00:30:00,188
without knocking down the others, then
we'll give you a keg of gun powder, too,

271
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,069
These hands of mine...

272
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,942
You said you was hungry, no?.

273
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,032
You are not lucky, old man.

274
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,573
We'll see.

275
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,089
Come on, we're leavin'!

276
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,493
- Didn't you get what you were after?.
- I said we're leavin'!

277
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,101
We're going to have to
sell these two pistols.

278
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:49,004
They won't fetch more than two bucks.

279
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,666
Enough to feed us for a while.

280
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:54,703
D'you expect

281
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:58,771
I was goin' to let you learn
to shoot on an empty stomach, son?

282
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,383
I don't care about me. But I want
to keep your belly full. Go on.

283
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:25,632
The only lotion in the world
that puts hair back on the heads of

284
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:29,201
people scalped by that fierce Indian
sitting bull! No more baldness!

285
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,441
Why it even cures other ailments from
flaking scalp all the way to flat fleet...

286
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,045
Now, don't you try to
get out of it, it's useless

287
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:38,111
you said that sharpshooter was no good
but I want to see him all the same, C'mon.

288
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,413
All right, let's go take a look at him.

289
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,804
Attention, attention,
people, please attention!

290
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,645
You will see a sensational act that
surely belongs in the pages of folklore,

291
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,082
you will tell your grandchildren

292
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,677
what you've seen on this
great day here, in this great city.

293
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:15,248
The one and only, the great Ricky Shot!
All right Mr. Champion!

294
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,232
I've seen guys who could shoot
the rope in half in Cheyenne.

295
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,936
Now before your eyes
you're going to witnesses an act

296
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,767
presented to people all over
in every country from here to Persia!

297
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:34,004
The sensational Ricky Shot, champion
sharpshooter! One, two, three.

298
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,751
What did you say ya' saw in Cheyenne?.

299
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,150
I hope you enjoyed yourselves,

300
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,279
folks, isn't he great?.

301
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,326
Thanks, we appreciate that, madam,
Thanks.

302
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,134
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
your attention.

303
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,741
Please absolute silence now;, the Champion
is ready for the wheel of chance.

304
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,542
Let her spin!

305
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:22,320
Brilliant, for aces
with exactly four shots.

306
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:25,123
The wheel of fortune stops.
Ace of diamonds, ace of clubs,

307
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,163
ace of hearts and ace of spades.

308
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:31,167
What have I got here?

309
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,500
Everyone a bulls eye as you can see
for yourselves. Thank you.

310
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,597
And now Ricky Shot thanks you for
the kind applause and will perform

311
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,268
for you his last, most stupendous number!.

312
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,040
Those shots were way low.
You still got a lot to learn,

313
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,171
How'd the collection go?.

314
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,513
About enough to get us thru the next
two weeks, go on, get it over with.

315
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,143
Hello, Martin.

316
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,711
You're looking fine.

317
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:25,954
Haven't changed a bit.

318
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,319
What do you want?.

319
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:30,421
You're gonna take me to Vigonza,

320
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,190
so I can sell him Billy Kane.

321
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,499
Get out of here, Kramer!

322
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,259
I can't manage it alone.

323
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:47,840
Ever since Billy discovered that I ran
out on him, he's been right on my heels.

324
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:52,109
Three days he's been on my trail.
I tell you I've had it!

325
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,707
Your friends just don't want
to part with you,

326
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:59,755
Take me to Vigonza,
He'll pay us well. But hurry up!

327
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:00,585
You get out of here,

328
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,682
Take me to Vigonza,
you no good son of a,,.

329
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,295
Let me introduce Ricky.

330
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:13,001
He can hit a dime
in the air at fifty paces!

331
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,471
So get out fast and don't come back!

332
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,584
I say we should have put
those holes in your head instead of

333
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,175
messin' up them hands,

334
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,130
One of Billy Kane's men?

335
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,224
Yeah.

336
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,469
He was one of the bandits
that held up the train, wasn't he?.

337
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,606
What about it?.

338
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,111
Anyway, what do you care?

339
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,719
What the hell are you doing?.

340
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,847
I'm taking my fifty percent.

341
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,291
Wait a minute!

342
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,359
Hey, what are you planning?

343
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,523
I'll see you later.

344
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,884
I wanna get drunk!
This place is like a morgue!

345
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,014
Come on! I'm paying for everybody!
Let's liven' it up,

346
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,321
Hey, Charlie, I want a drink.

347
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,008
So you found me, Billy...

348
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,987
It's about time, isn't it?

349
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,027
But now that I see ya' I feel better...

350
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,007
Well, maybe you'll
let me finish this first.

351
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:40,938
I'll take it.

352
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,034
Alright.

353
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,038
Thanks.

354
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,300
Come on, dance!

355
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:14,605
I'm payin' aren't I?.

356
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,245
Here, ya' want some?.

357
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:25,779
Go on. Drink!
Go on drink, I said.

358
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,986
Go ahead, girls.
Go on, keep on dancing!

359
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:34,024
Dance! I said dance!

360
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,040
Fancy seein' you here. Champion!

361
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:52,340
If you came here to get me,
it's too late.

362
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,815
Because I had a little
run-in with Billy.

363
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:58,852
Where did he go?.

364
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:07,121
Who the hell cares where
that son of a snake has gone?

365
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,459
He always turns up at the right moment.

366
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:14,693
Gimme!

367
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:22,868
Dance. Go on!

368
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,413
Hurry up and die, will you?

369
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,540
And don't stop 'till I tell ya!

370
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,277
Everything's free tonight.
Go on dance!

371
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:32,422
Hey you.

372
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:37,487
You get to tell Vigonza
Billy's returned alone.

373
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,491
Tell him Billy's men aren't
gonna get here until Friday,

374
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,294
All of them are planning
to go to... Tehuantepec.

375
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:50,703
His men are sick and tired of him
and they're ready to sell his hide.

376
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:53,072
Vigonza ought to know that all of
Billy's men are ready to

377
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,838
hand him over on a silver platter!

378
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,640
He'll pay you good.

379
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,877
Eh...

380
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,445
Hey, no...

381
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,752
Sardanapalus.

382
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,788
Who is this Sardanapalus?

383
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,688
Uh?.

384
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:19,898
An old king,

385
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:26,465
"The death of Sardanapalus."

386
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:32,377
What do they mean going off
and killin' all of them women?.

387
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,817
They say he wanted them murdered

388
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,712
because he didn't want to die alone.

389
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,987
You know, he had,..

390
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,221
the right idea.

391
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,927
Come here, Blondy.

392
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,794
Don't worry! You other girls
will get your chance!

393
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:59,135
And me too, if I'm going
to hell I want some company.

394
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,473
No! Kramer! Shoot me, you dog!

395
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,867
Hey, Martin! Martin,
show me how to use this.

396
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,566
You're learnin' how to shoot
with a dueling pistol.

397
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,405
What do you want with a six shooter?.

398
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:09,445
To get the men who robbed the train.

399
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:13,778
So that was really
on your mind, to use me,

400
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,715
They're the only ones
who can give testimony

401
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,844
and you're hoping
I'll lead you to them.

402
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:22,187
You're no better than I am. You
want to use me to kill Billy Kane!

403
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,054
Tehuantepec's the place where
you'll find him.

404
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:28,187
Get that out of your head!
You're not ready for Billy Kane yet.

405
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:29,629
He'd put all 6 shots in you
before you could reach for your gun.

406
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,463
Quit drumming up trade!
You're not doing the show.

407
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,143
I still could've done it without you!

408
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:49,113
Always fire two shots.

409
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,211
Because if you wait between shots
you might find yourself dead.

410
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:55,719
Shooting at a target is not
like shooting at a man.

411
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:00,728
It's being quick that counts
not how precise your aim is.

412
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,193
And forget them fancy tricks.

413
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,400
Just put your thumb on the hammer.

414
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:11,007
And then ease it
back slow while you draw...

415
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:14,040
See?. You're ready to aim
and shoot in one motion.

416
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,133
FIRE!

417
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,741
Always pick this point when you shoot.

418
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,841
Otherwise you're wasting bullets.

419
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:30,523
Not bad, but don't get any big ideas.

420
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:42,337
You'll have to do better than
that to get Billy Kane.

421
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,802
Look what he did to
that holster, will you?.

422
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,543
It seems like
it was cut with a razor.

423
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:54,075
That's about the greatest shot
I've seen in my time.

424
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,248
Why didn't he kill you on the train
along with everybody else?.

425
00:45:58,522 --> 00:45:59,853
Were you friends?.

426
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:05,260
I heard of him.

427
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,533
Look at that closely.
You can't do better than that

428
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,136
and you still want to
go to Tehuantepec?.

429
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:14,960
Yeah.

430
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,529
Trouble.

431
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,295
Eh. Hombre!

432
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,963
Ezequiel, que hacemos con estos?.

433
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:49,504
Make them get down and go

434
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:51,363
and unhitch their horses.

435
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,376
Aqui esta escrito que
es un gran irador,

436
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,944
Un tirador?.
Mira como mato al tirador! Huh!

437
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:08,286
Ezequiel, you're next!

438
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,919
No! No! Leave me alone!

439
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:23,229
Well, you're getting there.

440
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,382
It was luck. I'll mind the ladies.

441
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,081
Don't catch a cold ma'am.

442
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,745
Oh, thank you sir, thank you.

443
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,584
You girls all right?

444
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,884
Richard Martin!

445
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:45,189
Hey, Betty Star!
What are you doing here?

446
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:47,889
Me and my girls was on tour.

447
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:50,523
I guess that we're
the only ones that escaped,

448
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,499
If you want me to,
I'll take you to Tehuantepec.

449
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,594
One place is as good as another.

450
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:55,967
Let's get goin'.

451
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,233
Ricky!

452
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,603
You know each other?.
Where did you two meet?.

453
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,404
I'm always getting into debt
with Ricky, ain't l?

454
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:18,452
Billy Kane's men have arrived.

455
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,696
Eh! Vigonza! Como estas?.

456
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:25,029
You look more like a gringo every day,

457
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,034
How did it go, eh?.
How 'bout the others?

458
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,129
We split up into groups
when we left Arizona,

459
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,605
but all of us are meeting here tonight.

460
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,039
Ah, bueno, good!

461
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,405
It wasn't easy.

462
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,308
Hola, que tal?

463
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:39,372
Now Billy's got us
in trouble with the federals.

464
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:44,918
Billy Kane?. Billy Kane asks much
and don't give nothing.

465
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,421
He's loco Heah!

466
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:51,385
He likes blood but he don't like money.

467
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:55,389
Now we eat, amigos!
Sit down, sit down!

468
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:58,696
Hey you, bring out the good! De prisa!

469
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,167
He is the owner of the house.

470
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:05,002
But I picked his place
because it is close to Tehauantepec.

471
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:09,043
Quickly! The food for my amigos!
And pick up the cup you dropped!

472
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,740
Eat my friends, eat!

473
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:15,749
Cojelo!

474
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:34,365
Bueno, Billy is expectin' us
at the saloon after sundown.

475
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,464
And instead of us,
he's going to find you,

476
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:41,203
I kill him?

477
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,979
You mean me and my muchachos?.

478
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,777
Yeah. We're goin'
to stay right here,..

479
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:59,522
Maybe you'll kill him and maybe you won't.
Billy is bound to shoot up a few people,

480
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,926
and that ain't going to be us.

481
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,835
It's the quietest place on the whole
border.

482
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:18,176
It was built by Quakers.

483
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:20,943
Ever since they built the railroad,

484
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:24,380
there's been quite a bit of
money in circulation.

485
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,392
This town hasn't changed a bit.
Thank you. Thanks, Martin.

486
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:14,697
Our pleasure.

487
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:19,341
Everybody out, girls.

488
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,239
Well, it's about time.

489
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:23,243
You like it?

490
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:24,074
It's marvelous!

491
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,307
Careful there, honey.

492
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,547
This is where you'll stay.

493
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:29,908
Thank you!

494
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,594
Disculpe, senor.

495
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,222
You said this was a peaceful place...

496
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:45,665
Yes, it is.. in Texas,
But Mexico is on that side.

497
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,966
This is the border
line right here in the middle.

498
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,267
Welcome back, Betty.

499
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,736
Tequila or whisky?

500
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,074
Disculpe senor. Disculpe me!

501
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,812
Betty Star! Velvet legs!

502
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:01,884
Come here all of you! Come here
hombres and look who has arrived!

503
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,545
Go and get them!
You too! Vamos, vamos!

504
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:07,122
Ricky, I owe you something.

505
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:08,088
I'll be here.

506
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,621
You are new here, si?.
Can I buy a drink, senorita?.

507
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,945
Vigonza has respectfully
requested our presence...

508
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,081
It seems that Billy Kane's
men have arrived.

509
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,420
You, no.

510
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:51,423
Find out what these filthy pigs want.

511
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:54,470
Don't worry.
I'll wait for you at Eagle Rock.

512
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:21,527
Hey, amigo! You didn't bring me
the message of Kramer,

513
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,622
The last words of
a dying man are sacred.

514
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,758
He killed three of our men, Vigonza.

515
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:31,869
You want money?

516
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:36,809
Sure, why not?.

517
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,470
Vigonza,

518
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,450
what about him?.

519
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:42,916
Let me go eh!

520
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:44,350
He wants to leave us.

521
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,217
He can go.

522
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:49,721
Gracias senor.

523
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,518
Muchas gracias, senor,

524
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,286
What if he talks?

525
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:05,707
It's much money for you.

526
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,970
You get this from me
if you kill Billy Kane.

527
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:12,307
Go on.

528
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:16,709
When he turns his back, then you
will be able to give us a signal.

529
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,256
We will all shoot him
before he has the time to shoot us.

530
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:24,221
This is our signal, eh!

531
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,860
Come on play
something light and gay!

532
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,034
Ricky, you don't want to drink
that stuff, do you?.

533
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:39,467
This is what we keep
for the special customers.

534
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,839
It's going to be a bad night.
I can smell it...

535
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,813
Vigonza! Be careful,
it may mean trouble for you!

536
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:52,410
We're ready.

537
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,146
Hey, All of you!

538
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:56,918
Get out of here!

539
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,925
Come on hurry! You too,

540
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:02,657
Move everybody out of here.
Get ready, quickly!

541
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,630
Vamos! Rapido!

542
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:41,801
You better get out.

543
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,429
Ricky, don't do anything foolish!

544
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,666
I said get out!

545
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,674
Madre de dios!

546
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:31,442
Play!

547
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,693
Whisky, madam.

548
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,034
Are you Billy Kane?

549
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:53,803
What's it to you?

550
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,706
They gave me this money...

551
00:56:58,281 --> 00:56:59,213
to kill you.

552
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,213
That's mighty funny,

553
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:06,620
Your men have sold you
out to Vigonza.

554
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,961
And he's put you here
as bait I suppose.

555
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,334
There are six of them in here.

556
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,570
When I light a match...

557
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,142
they'll shoot you...

558
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,819
There's one sittin' by the table.

559
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:12,316
The rest is sitting in there,

560
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,114
Vigonza's hiding behind the piano.

561
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,962
I can see the tip of his boot.

562
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:24,593
Which end of the keyboard?

563
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:28,429
Where the high notes are,

564
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,803
Can you get one of them?.

565
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,633
Two: the one at the table,

566
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,176
and the one with the poncho.

567
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,081
Now!

568
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:14,377
There's one you missed.

569
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:17,583
Let's have some music.

570
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:32,763
What do you want from me?.

571
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,868
You can help me get back to my ranch.

572
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:39,806
I was on that train
for Tucson you held up.

573
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:44,068
But since. I hadn't any ticket,
they threw me off.

574
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,977
Then they found my knife in the
belly of the train conductor.

575
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,408
The judge gave me thirty years.

576
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:50,417
How did you get out?.

577
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,984
Some of the jailbirds
made a break and I went along.

578
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,650
I'm wanted dead or alive.

579
00:59:57,226 --> 01:00:00,684
All I need is one of your men that
can swear I didn't rob that train,

580
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,930
That's the only way I know
to prove that I'm not guilty.

581
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,198
And you want me.

582
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:10,238
Never even thought of it.
One of your men'll do.

583
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:12,697
It's a deal.

584
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:18,077
He's goin' to warn the others.

585
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:35,987
Martin!

586
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:40,259
I guess you Saw what happened?.

587
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,305
Yeah I Saw it, it doesn't matter.

588
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,673
You're disappointed aren't you?

589
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,505
I counted on him to get
Billy Kane for me.

590
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:54,308
I thought he was gonna do it, too.

591
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:57,852
But he had his own reasons
to act the way he did.

592
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:09,149
Well?. Is he dead?.

593
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,002
Take your choice.

594
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,238
You want Clem?.

595
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:34,283
Clem likes to talk.
Keep you company on your trip...

596
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,852
Or take Doc here.
He could bandage a wound

597
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:43,988
or pull your tooth if it hurts.

598
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,628
What about Dirty here?.

599
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,003
He has got a strong smell

600
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:01,702
but he wouldn't harm a flea.

601
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:08,681
I guess that's why you got so many
flea bites, ain't it, Dirty?

602
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,583
You can have Bastard Sam, too.

603
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,989
They wanted to lynch him

604
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,330
'cause he shacked up
with a ten-year-old girl.

605
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:27,166
Wasn't my fault.
I thought she was twelve,

606
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,746
One of you is going with
my friend here to the sheriff.

607
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:43,582
Maybe you'll get hung,

608
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,580
but it's something I owe him.

609
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:59,024
Which one do you want?

610
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:03,728
It makes no difference,
Just as long as he talks.

611
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:06,572
If he won't talk for you,

612
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:10,242
he won't talk anymore.

613
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,476
I'll make the choice!

614
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:19,254
We couldn't go on anymore
like we was. Billy.

615
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,355
You were taking...
taking half of everything!

616
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,358
They asked you to be spokesman?.

617
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:26,420
You, Doc?.

618
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,757
Not me, Billy! I didn't want
to sell you out, they did!

619
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,024
Get in the corner!

620
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:32,196
Pretty boy!

621
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,061
Too busy thinking of women.

622
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,065
Hurry up!

623
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:43,100
You! Get over there!

624
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:51,581
You tried to sell me out
but you lost. No hard feelings.

625
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:58,389
The one that draws
the lowest card goes with him,

626
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:08,986
Here's your man.

627
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:19,638
Now we are even, right?.

628
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:33,277
Get the horses ready.
We're goin' into town,

629
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:34,879
What are you thinking of doing?.

630
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,550
You said you wanted more money,
Well, we're getting it!

631
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,356
Before sun-up.

632
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,430
And in Tehuantepec.

633
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,369
Was that you shooting?.

634
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,174
Yeah, A coyote.

635
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,050
This is Nuno.

636
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,144
I know him.

637
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,685
Martin, I better tell you something.
I was on that train, too.

638
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:29,387
So I've been told.

639
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:31,964
When are you planning on going?.

640
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:33,329
At dawn.

641
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,428
As soon as I've turned him
into the sheriff,

642
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,733
I'm going back to my folks' ranch.

643
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:40,070
Martin, why don't you come with me?.

644
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:44,803
I don't fit into bedroom slippers, I've
tried 'em. I'll stick to my old boots.

645
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:50,048
You've been a good teacher.

646
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:54,181
A good teacher doesn't teach
you how to kill a man.

647
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,127
You could have been killed tonight!

648
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:01,822
It never crossed my mind to face him.

649
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:04,365
It's a private fight
between the two of you.

650
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:06,657
See you tomorrow.

651
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,468
No, Ricky. I guess
we'd better just forget about it.

652
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:50,300
Ready?

653
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:55,872
Here!

654
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:12,923
Martin!

655
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:17,700
Hey, Martin!

656
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:29,667
Hey, sheriff.

657
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:33,575
You recognize him?.
He's waiting for you outside.

658
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:40,755
Billy! We're ready!

659
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:53,392
Here I am, Billy Kane!

660
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,103
Those good old days
were long ago, Martin.

661
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,074
You can't even see,

662
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:35,471
much less hold a gun.

663
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,839
Load your gun, Go ahead.

664
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:37,529
They're behind the windows.

665
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:43,366
Don't worry. They haven't
got the guts to fire at us.

666
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:46,397
There's always some
hot-head wherever you go.

667
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:37,480
Is it bad?

668
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:28,138
Guess that's the end of the heroes.

669
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:08,574
Give me the key, grandpa.

670
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:12,980
That's right.

671
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:21,093
Get a move on, you two!

672
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,904
He finally caught up with Billy Kane.

673
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,473
Why did he have to do it?

674
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:35,475
Every time Billy shot somebody,

675
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:37,545
it was like he was pulling
the trigger instead.

676
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:39,944
Top gun

677
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,975
Richard Martin - Billy Kane,

678
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:52,656
shooting competition,
Dallas county fair 1876.

679
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:56,020
They won it when they were
giving shows together.

680
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:58,127
They were really something.

681
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:02,168
Then Billy got the idea he could do
better robbing trains and banks,

682
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,862
so he left him,

683
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,268
Guess they were pretty good friends.

684
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:12,307
They were almost brothers, Martin
taught him everything about shooting.

685
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:17,215
For him, it was his duty to go off

686
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,378
and put an end to him.

687
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:26,027
Forget about it, Ricky,
or I'll have lost you both!

688
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:44,711
Hey wait! Don't go yet.
I saw them go into the saloon.

689
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:48,613
Billy! Billy Kane!

690
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:53,945
I Killed the gringo! I'm alone!

691
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:55,349
It's Nuno!

692
01:19:57,192 --> 01:20:01,492
Call him again. This time
make it more convincing.

693
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,894
Let me go, he will kill me.

694
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:08,359
Billy Kane!

695
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:13,034
I'm wounded! Where are you?.

696
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:16,037
Help me, you dog!

697
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:20,571
Well, what d'you know.

698
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,245
He must have given him the slip.

699
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:25,717
Quiet, you fool.

700
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,984
Billy, come and help me!

701
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:38,695
This young friend of mine,
laid a trap for me.

702
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,267
What does he want?.

703
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:41,425
Me.

704
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:43,697
Help me, Billy!

705
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,740
He's finally in business for himself.

706
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:50,868
I'm wounded, Billy!

707
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,441
Where are you?!

708
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:03,551
Billy!

709
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:06,253
Billy Kane!

710
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:10,754
Help me, I'm wounded!

711
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:25,208
That hijo de puta made me, I had to.

712
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,209
Where did he go?.

713
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:32,184
I could not warn you. He made me.

714
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:33,478
Where is he?

715
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:35,418
Somewhere!

716
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:42,456
Billy, I think you
too are a hijo de puta.

717
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,069
Hey, Preston!

718
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:25,701
You're not too smart!

719
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:31,139
You should have gone,
while the goin' was good.

720
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:32,674
Hey, Ricky!

721
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:35,910
It's too bad!

722
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:39,178
No one to prove your innocence.

723
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:43,286
You shouldn't have come back!

724
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:51,061
But fellows like you wanna die,
wanna be a hero!

725
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:04,701
Alright!

726
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:17,283
When the bucket is empty,
we'll both come out shooting.

727
01:23:58,233 --> 01:23:59,359
What's wrong?.

728
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:04,030
Think I'd believe
you'd stick by your word?.

729
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:08,369
You really want to get killed,
don't you?.

730
01:24:09,644 --> 01:24:12,477
Alright, I'll fix you up.

731
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:09,249
You think I can't get rid of you
whenever I want?. Do you hear me?!

732
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:21,798
Did you ever see anybody get rid of
the king, as clean as that?.

733
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:24,468
Without touchin'the other pieces?.

734
01:27:33,781 --> 01:27:35,840
I was Martin's pupil, too.

735
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:39,145
I know all his tricks.

736
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:43,987
He taught 'em to me to kill you,

737
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:45,887
Billy Kane.

738
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:42,802
Just to kill you, Billy Kane.

739
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:50,280
Bye, Betty.

740
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:53,380
Ricky, what are you gonna do
if you have to always run away?

741
01:29:53,488 --> 01:29:56,582
What else can I do?
I lost all my witnesses.

742
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:59,019
What's your real name, Ricky?.

743
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:00,284
Philip Raymond.

744
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:03,887
No. Philip Raymond
was killed with the others.

745
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:06,894
I'm going to tell the sheriff
that a stranger killed him,

746
01:30:07,835 --> 01:30:08,597
a man called Ricky Shot.
