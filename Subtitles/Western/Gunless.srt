1
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,687
(gunshot)

2
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,195
(soft piano music)

3
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,999
(music fading)

4
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,793
(man groaning softly)

5
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,724
- You, uh...

6
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,229
speaky...

7
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,833
English?

8
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,525
- Do you?

9
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,569
(sniffing)

10
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,400
You stink.

11
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,065
- You don't say.

12
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,574
Oh...

13
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,178
think maybe you could unsnare me?

14
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,649
Oh... Oh.

15
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,914
Better untie me.
(grunting)

16
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,077
(groaning)

17
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,483
- Pardon?

18
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,659
- Ah, forget it.

19
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,159
God... dammit.

20
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,529
Where the hell am I?

21
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,938
- Barclay's Brush.
- Where?

22
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,976
- In the Dominion of Canada.

23
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,003
(grunting softly)

24
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,610
- Just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse. Huh.

25
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,719
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

26
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,382
How can I help you?

27
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,926
(sighing)

28
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,359
- Bullets.

29
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,054
<i>- Mon Dieu, we are...</i>

30
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:56,726
we are fresh out of bullets.
Um, perhaps I could interest you

31
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,167
in some tea?
A little, uh...

32
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,205
"special tea"?
- As a matter of fact,

33
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,968
we do carry ammunition.

34
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,406
What calibre, sir?

35
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,479
- Ah-ah-ah! No poaching.
My customer, my side.

36
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,139
You can't talk to him.
- Oh...

37
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,682
how clumsy of me.

38
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,718
I've spilled bullets
all over the counter.

39
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,453
Good day, sir.
How can I be of assistance?

40
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,791
- I need cartridges,
45.40 Colt.

41
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,126
- That will be $1.10,
or a penny a bullet.

42
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,963
- The thing is that I'm a lick strapped
at the moment.

43
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,798
Maybe we could settle up this account

44
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,462
a little later...
- Sorry, no credit.

45
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,972
Your rules.

46
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,839
Oh, I see.
It's okay when you break the rules.

47
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,708
But when I bend them just a little,
we have to sever the partnership.

48
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,611
- There is an enormous distinction

49
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,844
between having
a flexible policy on credit

50
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,783
and contravening the law!

51
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,684
Prohibition, Claude,
means no liquor.

52
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,688
<i>- Salaud.
- Thank you very much,</i>

53
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,725
Mr., um...

54
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,886
"The Montana Kid."

55
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,089
- I'll show you prohibition!

56
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,961
Free drinks!

57
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,897
Free whiskey

58
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,867
for anyone on my side...

59
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,165
(argument covered by music)

60
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,706
...to some stranger who smells

61
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,833
like he came out the back end
of a pig is a retail genius!

62
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,969
- Explain.
(argument drowned out by music)

63
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,316
- He walks out that door,
you never see this bum again.

64
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,529
(gulping)

65
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,828
- I'm not partial to insults.

66
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,333
But...

67
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,139
...seeing as one of you

68
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,573
was clearly raised by a mother
of a fiercely hideous countenance,

69
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,179
I am affected by a rare blush of...

70
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,645
...compassion.

71
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,512
Put me down for three more.

72
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,181
And one carrot.

73
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,849
Son of a...

74
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,351
(flies buzzing)

75
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,581
Ahem. Hey.

76
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,782
Ahem. Hey there, you two.

77
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,587
Either of you seen my mount?

78
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,787
It's a chestnut

79
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,763
with a Cheyenne roll on the saddle.
I left him just back...

80
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,164
- Whoa, steady on there, mister.

81
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,338
- You just tell me,
have you seen my animal?

82
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,499
- Jack collected a stray.

83
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,167
Blacksmith?

84
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,710
Behind you?

85
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,178
(horse neighing)

86
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,184
(whinnying furiously)

87
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,885
- That's my horse.
(gun cocking)

88
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,583
I believe he's in pain.

89
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,755
- Reckon so. A stone bruise.

90
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,832
- So first you thieve him,
then deliver him to torment?

91
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,799
- I retrieved a stray.

92
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,531
- I've shot men for less.

93
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,803
- You need to reign in that temper,
mister.

94
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,751
I ain't done.

95
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,911
He forged that hoof.

96
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,186
- You ain't touchin' him.

97
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,989
- I don't got time
for a common nuisance.

98
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,266
- What did you just call me?
- A nuisance.

99
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,892
- No, before that.
What did you call me?

100
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,766
- Common?
- Oh...

101
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,136
you just stepped over the line.
Hey, whoa, whoa!

102
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,334
What the he...?

103
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,515
What kind of man
would pick up another man?!

104
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,617
Hey, you! Hey!

105
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,019
I ain't finished with you,
you big ape.

106
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,318
- Swear to God, I ain't got...
- What the hell?!

107
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,358
(grunting)

108
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,984
(gun cocking)

109
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,324
- Get...

110
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,989
your...

111
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,532
gun.

112
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,475
(groaning)

113
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,478
(groaning)

114
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,517
I'm callin' you out.

115
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,753
(knuckles cracking)

116
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,757
I said I'm callin' you out.

117
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,794
(slow western music)

118
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,029
Hey, what...?

119
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,227
Ahem.

120
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,432
You mind telling that big ape in there
I'm callin' him out here.

121
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,434
- Jack! The windmill...

122
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,513
(western music)

123
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,313
Ah, there's no rush.

124
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,979
It'll take a couple of days
to fashion the windmill. Come on.

125
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,252
Jack says to tell you he can't oblige.
He's got no gun.

126
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,454
- He's a liar.
- Is not. The man's an ironsmith.

127
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,430
And he's right. You stink.

128
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,468
- That man stole my horse.

129
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,662
- He was trying to help.

130
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:37,572
- You tell him to get a gun on his belt.
At sundown, we'll square this up.

131
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,440
- He says not to be riding him
for at least two days.

132
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,309
- Sundown.

133
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,782
- Your bottom is bleeding.

134
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,479
- Yeah, I know.

135
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,524
(grunting softly)
(screaming)

136
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,767
(screaming)
- Well, hello again.

137
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,502
I'd say a.36 calibre.
Am I right?

138
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,976
- I didn't get a good look at it
on the way in.

139
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,946
- Well, did you get a good look
at what hit you on the head?

140
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:22,282
Because that is a peevish gash.
- Ah, God! Mother of Mary! Mary!

141
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,049
- Well, it's Dr. Angus Schiffron,
actually.

142
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,716
Well, you can call me Mary, then.
- Where's my gun?

143
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,420
- Hold on, Tex.
I still gotta patch up that gluteus.

144
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,259
- Where?
- Uh, your gluteus, in your backside.

145
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,367
- No. Where is my gun?

146
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,204
I appreciate you tendin' to my wounds,
doc, but I ain't got no money.

147
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,742
- I always pull the first bullet
out of a man's posterior pro bono.

148
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,368
It's a time-honoured tradition.

149
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,447
Now, if you just let me
patch up that wound,

150
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,981
I can get...
- What did you do?

151
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,381
- I had to get to your injury, eh?

152
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,386
- You cut a man's breeches?

153
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,088
- Uh... uh, sir? That is not an area
that braves infection with grace!

154
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,229
<i>No one understands</i>

155
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,358
(western music)
(children laughing)

156
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,403
<i>A wanted man</i>

157
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:19,276
<i>'Cause you live by a code
Known by the ghosts of the dead</i>

158
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,779
<i>And you gotta keep movin'
With that price on your head</i>

159
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:26,373
<i>Still no time for a friend
(muttering)</i>

160
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,714
- Dammit.

161
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,553
<i>Get outta my way. I'll shoot ya.
When any stranger could be the end</i>

162
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,990
Move, move.

163
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,595
- Well, Mrs. Taylor, assembling
the drive in that old windmill,

164
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,291
it would be a chore even for a man
well-versed in matters mechanical.

165
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,301
- If you're referring to my husband,
you know he's long gone.

166
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,234
- No. No, no, no.
I'm only saying

167
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,306
that it's mechanically complex.
Perhaps you need...

168
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,500
- Pants! I need pants.
- Do you mind?

169
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,167
- I'll just be a moment,

170
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,778
Mr. Montana.

171
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,108
- Pardon my idiot partner's rudeness.

172
00:11:56,248 --> 00:12:00,651
Can I offer you a splash
of my best Scottish tea?

173
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,811
And some delicious ground nuts?

174
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:06,049
- We specifically agreed
that I was to sell the dry goods

175
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,887
and you were to sell...
- Boys, please,

176
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:12,020
I have to get a crop in this season.
The part will have a pointy thing

177
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,563
that goes in here.
Please?

178
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,792
- Very well, Mrs. Taylor.
Now, you have to give me

179
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,903
a part name,
so I know what to order.

180
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,005
- You just need a shear pin, all right?

181
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,130
- Like you know.
- Yeah, I do. Now, pants.

182
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,367
- What kind of trousers
can we order for you today,

183
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,807
Mr. Montana?
- Order?

184
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,378
No, I need 'em now.

185
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,414
That butcher up there
cut my pants, on pro bono.

186
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,076
- Yes. Well, all our apparel
is purchased on order.

187
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,882
- What the hell kinda general store
is this?

188
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,455
- They stock soap.

189
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,559
- Soap and escargots.

190
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,217
Lots and lots of escargots!

191
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,489
<i>- I specifically ordered tin nails
and they sent me tin snails.</i>

192
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:50,568
- So do I absolutely need a shear pin,
or can I just use a nail or something?

193
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,194
- You could use your nose,
for all I care.

194
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,645
(western music)

195
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,516
(knuckles cracking)

196
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,120
- Talk has it
that you're the Montana Kid.

197
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,813
- That's right.

198
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,653
- "Among America's
most notorious gunslingers are:

199
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,698
Wild Bill Hickok, John Wesley Harding
and the Montana Kid."

200
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,097
Are you that "the Montana Kid"?

201
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,567
- I reckon so.

202
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,935
- Says here you killed six men.

203
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,099
- Eleven.

204
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,542
- You don't look like a kid.
- Nicknames have a way of sticking.

205
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,375
Decades, even.
Ain't that right?

206
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,982
- I guess so.

207
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,677
- Is it true you're proposing
a gunfight today, with Jack?

208
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,049
- Sundown.

209
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,680
(suspenseful music)

210
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,054
(cheering)

211
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,289
- Showdown with the Montana Kid!
- Right here in Barclay's Brush!

212
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,797
- The town hasn't seen
this much excitement

213
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,960
since Larry accidentally set fire
to his prized ewe!

214
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,230
Can Jack duel with my Winchester?

215
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,101
'Cause he doesn't have one.
- Hang on, hang on!

216
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,471
What about mine?
Mine's practically brand new. See?

217
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,977
(hat-wearing man sighing)
- What's wrong with you people?

218
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,479
- Yah, what's wrong with you?
It's up to Jack, no?

219
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,083
And he might like my shotgun best.

220
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,016
- It's not a turkey shoot.
It's a gunfight. He needs a pistol.

221
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,553
Where the hell are you from?

222
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,951
- Peterborough.
- Moncton.

223
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,059
- Uppsala.
- Any of you got a Hog Leg like this?

224
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,921
- Well, that's a cattleman's revolver,
isn't it?

225
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,198
Ow. A Peacemaker.
(clicking tongue)

226
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,700
An Equalizer.
(clicking tongue)

227
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,303
A Widowmaker.

228
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,599
- Stop that.
- Yeah...

229
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,033
- Well, does anyone got one?
- Mm-hmm.

230
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,667
- When the cowboys ride through,

231
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,303
they have pistols. And rum.
But otherwise, um...

232
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,576
- No, truth is,
I don't know anyone who has, uh...

233
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,016
uh, what do call it?
- A Peacemaker!

234
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,381
- Stop it.

235
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,751
- There's just not much call
for one around here.

236
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,882
We got rifles for huntin',
shotguns for birds.

237
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,857
Pistols, well,
they're just for... you know.

238
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,192
- Killing people.
Seems to me Jack not having a gun

239
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,528
<i>is your problem, not his.
- Oh, my problem is you.</i>

240
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,900
- So why don't you just shoot him?
- Why don't I just shoot you?

241
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,836
- Same reason.

242
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,498
I'm unarmed.

243
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,838
So that is the code, isn't it?

244
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,310
You can't shoot an unarmed man.
- Mm-hmm.

245
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,278
- I'm thinkin' I can make an exception.

246
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,512
- Tell you what... shear pin,

247
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,818
I've got a pistol you can use.
I mean, it needs fixing, though.

248
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,587
The handle's cracked
and the hammer's broke.

249
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,055
- Fine.

250
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,897
- And you don't get it for nothing.
Deal is, you get the gun

251
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,700
if you help me
get my windmill up and running.

252
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,569
- Why don't you get your husband
to get it up?

253
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,234
- Do you want your showdown or not?

254
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,878
(western music)

255
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,582
(man grunting)

256
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,252
(groaning)

257
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,454
(groaning)

258
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,906
- Hey, you wanna go back?
By some direct conspiracy of fate,

259
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,600
it seems you missed a bump.
(groaning)

260
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,836
(rattling)
Ow!!! That's it!

261
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,537
That's it! Whoa!

262
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,341
Whoa! Stop!
- Whoa...

263
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,643
- Stop! Ah...

264
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:29,015
I think we'll take it... by foot
from here.

265
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,849
- Suit yourself.

266
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,356
It's, uh, just over that ridge.

267
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,858
And stay off that horse.

268
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,486
Come on, Peaches.
(clicking tongue)

269
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,200
- What is it with these people, huh?
No sidearms,

270
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,304
a medico who shreds your clothing,

271
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,497
a saloon with...
teacups and catalogues,

272
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,040
and that...

273
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,542
woman.
(horse snorting)

274
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,169
A mouthpiece.

275
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,714
Hey, I'm not talkin' to myself here.
Get up with me.

276
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,984
Come on.

277
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,652
So what do you figure?
How far are we from a real country?

278
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,319
(horse snorting)

279
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,328
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right.

280
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,332
You're right, he'll be comin' for me.

281
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:20,063
Ten years of doggin' me -
he's not gonna let a border stop him.

282
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,003
We'll make tracks
as soon as we get things squared.

283
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,610
(horse snorting)
Well, you know,

284
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:29,145
you're not so sweet-smellin' yourself,
pal.

285
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,182
You got mealy old carrot breath.

286
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,341
(horse whinnying)

287
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,419
Well, you do.

288
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,919
You stink.

289
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,253
(thunder rumbling softly)

290
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,949
(donkey braying)

291
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,760
- Put your horse in here.

292
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,163
It should be safe.

293
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,497
Bunk in there.
There's an oil lamp

294
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,072
just inside the door.
- Outhouse is made out of dirt.

295
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,699
- It was good enough for me
and my husband for over a year.

296
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,745
- Where's the gun?
- Time enough for that in the morning.

297
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,542
- We had a deal
and I want that gun...

298
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,150
right now.

299
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,685
- Keeps what's left of your pants on.

300
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,287
Here.

301
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,990
(cocking)

302
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,499
- That's bad.

303
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,762
Why do you even bother
carrying this?

304
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:29,499
- To frighten away bothersome folk
mostly.

305
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,202
Pistol's not just for killing people.
It's also real good for scaring 'em.

306
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,678
- This isn't scary.

307
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,017
<i>There was a time</i>

308
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,712
(western music)

309
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,383
<i>When you believed</i>

310
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,886
<i>When everything</i>

311
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,259
<i>Was springtime green</i>

312
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,832
<i>Before you learned
that life was mean</i>

313
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,833
<i>And nothin's</i>

314
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,131
<i>Ever what it seems</i>

315
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,603
Mother of Mary.

316
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,854
Ow.

317
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,990
You sure that ain't dry?
- There's water!

318
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,650
It's just deep!

319
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,456
That's why this windmill's
gonna be a godsend!

320
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,269
See, I figure if we construct
the windmill here,

321
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:35,396
then the water'll be convenient
to both the livestock and the crop.

322
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,974
- Well, I'd... I'd put the...

323
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,805
the windmill right here
on top of the well.

324
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,344
That'd be the shorter straw,

325
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,711
then you could pipe the water
wherever you want - the house,

326
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,785
the pens, out in the field.

327
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,354
- You volunteering to lay all that pipe,
shear pin?

328
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,822
- Oh, no, ma'am, no.

329
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,827
The deal was,
just help build the windmill.

330
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,864
- Well, then why don't you do that
and run along.

331
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,899
Stow your ideas.

332
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,160
(soft music)

333
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,839
- Mouthpiece.

334
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,014
(music)

335
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,630
What... what is this supposed to be?

336
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,026
- Meat?

337
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,032
- Hmm.

338
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,870
- Mm...

339
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,377
Argh, you know, it's really
unpleasant to sit downwind of you.

340
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:54,479
What is that stench, anyway?

341
00:20:56,054 --> 00:21:00,286
- Before they got to hangin' me,
they cleaned my plow pretty good.

342
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:04,293
They lashed me to a stumpin' post
in a pig pen,

343
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,660
left me there for three days,
waiting for him.

344
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,198
- Who's him?

345
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,325
- There's a bounty on my head.

346
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,769
It's common knowledge
north of the Mason-Dixon

347
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,875
that there's a particularly hostile
disfigured individual

348
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,843
who's been huntin' for that reward
for a long, long time.

349
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,509
So these folk thought it prudent
that they'd wait,

350
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,380
and then they would split the bounty
with him.

351
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,044
After the lynchin', the party got bored
and they kinda wandered off,

352
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:33,646
then the other half decided to proceed,
but they didn't know nothing

353
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,420
about a hanging,
so they picked a dead tree.

354
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,826
- So why is there a price on your head?
Huh?

355
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,957
You shoot someone
who was tending to your horse?

356
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,804
- You shouldn't make light
of what you know nothin' about.

357
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,873
(up-tempo western music)

358
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,000
(music fading)

359
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,732
(man humming)

360
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,207
- Ow!

361
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,812
Shoot!

362
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:30,540
Ah... Well, good day, eh?

363
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,947
You, uh, hoofing
all the way in from Jane's?

364
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,020
- Yeah. I started early.
Skipped breakfast.

365
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,145
- It's funny you should mention that,

366
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,555
because the missus would like
to have you for dinner this evening.

367
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,092
(chuckling)
The truth is,

368
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,253
she is chomping at the bit

369
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,763
to meet
a bona-fide American gunfighter.

370
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,062
- She's not plannin'
on servin' that thing, is she?

371
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,602
- Uh, no. Uh...

372
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,298
but I reckon...

373
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,874
Jane's cooking
probably suits you just fine.

374
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,136
Shall we say 6:00?
- Yeah.

375
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,506
- Yeah.

376
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,945
- Isn't, uh, skinnin' stuff
kind of an odd pastime

377
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,948
for a healer?
- Not really.

378
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:11,078
'Cause once a being's dead,
it's nothin' but dead.

379
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,521
But I suppose you know that.

380
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,428
- Whoa!
- Pardon me.

381
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,630
(man groaning)
Oh, my, that's gonna leave a mark.

382
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,041
- Hey, Mr. Montana, please,

383
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,982
sidle on up to the counter.

384
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,054
Perhaps I can interest you in... this.

385
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,214
It's a, uh, full-bodied little number.

386
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,918
The bouquet's a tad intimidating...

387
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,221
- No, I just need...
- Oh, no, no, no.

388
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,796
It contains laudanum,
don't you know.

389
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,422
A couple of these,
you'll be baying at the moon.

390
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,229
- You're selling spirits!
- Cough medication, Claude.

391
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,271
General stores sell cough medication.
- Idiot!

392
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,340
- Look...

393
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,443
I need a part for a gun.

394
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,738
It's a hammer

395
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:11,212
for a Navy Colt.44 calibre.
And I need bullets.

396
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:15,149
Not that many. It'd be a miracle
if he gets off one shot.

397
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,551
- Yeah, showdown with a.44!
(clicking tongue)

398
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,056
- Stop it.
- Mm...

399
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,858
Uh-oh.

400
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,732
- Oh, no, gimme those.

401
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,528
Gimme those.

402
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,604
I am warning you.
(man coughing): Unarmed!

403
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:37,299
- Shut up. If you step out that door...
(door closing)

404
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,875
Damn.

405
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,003
- Just follow my finger to the...

406
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,349
Okay, just follow my finger
to the right.

407
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,011
Just follow my finger to the right.

408
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:56,387
- My grandfather says he would
be honoured to repair your pants.

409
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:00,589
He says you may wear a pair of his
until yours are repaired.

410
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,200
- Yeah, yeah.

411
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,462
Look, look.

412
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:09,199
(slow western music)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

413
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,350
- Railroad workers.

414
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,825
My grandparents let them rest here
between construction lines.

415
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:34,193
Giving food and shelter to these people
is an honour.

416
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:40,064
They no speaky Englishy.

417
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,508
(speaking Chinese)

418
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,817
- My grandfather says
he would be honoured

419
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,358
if you would use this tub

420
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,985
for bathing.

421
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,461
- Mm.

422
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,526
Ahem. It is that bad, isn't it?

423
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,140
(creaking)

424
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,302
(soft suspenseful music)

425
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,575
(screaming)

426
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,280
Never compromise a man's lifeline.

427
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,584
- I'm sorry!
Grandpa told me to give you food!

428
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,989
I thought you were asleep!

429
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,698
Ahem. Hey, listen, listen, kid.

430
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,324
(whimpering)
It's all right.

431
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,061
It's all right. Honest.

432
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,502
Hey, look at me.

433
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,740
You know, that chow looks pretty good.

434
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,073
Do you think maybe
you could get me a fresh bowl?

435
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,986
Ladies.

436
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,617
(soft music)

437
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,492
Oh, don't start.

438
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,866
Why are you even here?
- Standing invitation every Wednesday.

439
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,132
Doc tells me we're dining partners.
- Just great.

440
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,400
- Nice blouse, by the way.
- Okay, shut up.

441
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,237
Let's get this over with.
(snickering)

442
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,471
- My mother wore
something like that once.

443
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,137
- Very funny.
- Well, she did!

444
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,146
- Well, come on in.
- Yeah.

445
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:33,841
- Is that a blouse?

446
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,995
- Be sure to save room for dessert,
Mr. Montana.

447
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,691
Beatrice brought a dish
of her apple cobbler.

448
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,734
It is a treat beyond compare!
- Oh, it's nothing.

449
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,100
Beth is being humble
in her praise.

450
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,673
She's the real baker
in Barclay's Brush.

451
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,503
Come July,
when the strawberries ripen,

452
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:02,579
she makes a strawberry-rhubarb pie
you'd simply kill for.

453
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,111
- Hmm.
(nervous laughter)

454
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,652
- Beatrice.

455
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:14,282
Uh, how about the question
of how many men you've shot?

456
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,623
<i>The Canadian Monthly
specifically reports six.</i>

457
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:21,095
- It must be so exciting,
living wild on the open range,

458
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,996
happy and free,
sleeping under a canopy of stars,

459
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,625
every moment an adventure?

460
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,534
- The Wild West!
- Stop it.

461
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:32,200
- Larry, we talked about this.
Please don't badger our guest.

462
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:33,810
(chuckling)

463
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,812
- Ahem.

464
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,846
Eleven.

465
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,921
I have killed 11 men.

466
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,926
And they each earned their bullet
of their own accord.

467
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,062
I've been called out four times.

468
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,065
I've responded in self-defence twice.

469
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,729
- I think duelling
is incredibly romantic!

470
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,873
- Dear...

471
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:07,034
- Three men called me a cheat
in a Kansas City card game.

472
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:10,045
And one time I came across
a man beating a dog.

473
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:13,150
Bad. I mean, real bad.

474
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,512
- Gravy?

475
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:17,780
- But the first man I killed, well...

476
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,186
the first man I killed

477
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,849
killed my pa.

478
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,119
He had black eyes, black beard,
black soul.

479
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,992
He and my pa got into it

480
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,623
over an unbranded calf
my pa knew to be his.

481
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,169
So they settled matters with fisticuffs
and my pa gave him a whoopin'.

482
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,965
But as he rode away,

483
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,200
that lying coward shot him in the back.

484
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,079
- That is so sad!

485
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,511
- Yeah.
So the next day,

486
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,277
I rode up to his porch.
I called him out,

487
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,852
and my first shot
punched him in the gut.

488
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,183
Now, if you know
anything about killing -

489
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,056
I'm sure you all do -

490
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,460
you know that a gut shot
is the ugliest way

491
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,998
to do it. Keeps you livin'
just long enough to...

492
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,533
to experience

493
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,160
every second of pain.

494
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,072
And after an hour

495
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,268
of him kinda whinin' and moanin'
and whimperin',

496
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,403
I had it.
So I shot him right here.

497
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,115
That was that.

498
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,013
He was dead.

499
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,391
- So then Jack
will make it an even dozen.

500
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,392
- He's not shooting Jack.

501
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,895
- Yeah, I am.

502
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,000
I tell you what...

503
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:39,160
I'd kill for some more potatoes.

504
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,874
(horse snorting)
(military drum cadence)

505
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,743
(flute music)

506
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,482
- Ah... Dang.

507
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,760
Good morning, sir!

508
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,063
Ahem. Corporal J.T. Kent,

509
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,866
Northwest Mounted Police,
Fort McNeil troop.

510
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:22,077
And this is my liaison and guide,
K'Wala.

511
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,874
- People call me Two Dogs.

512
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,882
- And?
- As per the standing directive

513
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:29,248
of Her Majesty's government
in the Dominion of Canada,

514
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,685
I am making the rounds
of the southwest sector

515
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,883
of our allotted region.

516
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,584
Thank you.

517
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,854
(laughing)

518
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,554
- And?

519
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,597
- And, as part of my rounds,

520
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:46,067
I'm under instructions
to check in with all adults -

521
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,604
men... new men... and women -

522
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,231
and households in my zone.

523
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,310
- So...?

524
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,706
- So.

525
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,705
How's it going?
- Good.

526
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,715
- Any problems?
- None.

527
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,319
- Concerns?
- No.

528
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,119
- Ahem. Very well, then.

529
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,451
Sign here, please.

530
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,719
- What is this?

531
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,352
- A rounds journal.
You sign it after I check in.

532
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,796
- You ain't from around here, are ya?
- America.

533
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,732
- Oh... Still have to sign.

534
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,465
We need your true full name,
please.

535
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,507
(western music)
- Mm...

536
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,875
- Not a smuggler, are you?
- No.

537
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,879
- Whiskey trader?
- No.

538
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,314
- Horse thief.
- No.

539
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,883
- All right. Good day, sir.

540
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:41,389
Oh, one more thing...

541
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,790
Sean.
- Sean?!

542
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,793
(sighing)
- How long will you be staying

543
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,363
in Canada?

544
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,296
- I could leave by sundown,
if you'd loan me that gun of yours

545
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,598
for a spell.
- Regrettably, I must decline, sir.

546
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,172
That would be a flagrant contravention

547
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,275
of rule number 44
of the constables' code

548
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,877
of behaviour,
hygiene and equipment care.

549
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,877
- That's, uh, rule 45, there, chief.

550
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,915
- Okay. Thank you, K'Wala.

551
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:09,979
Ahem. Miss Taylor?

552
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:17,083
- You gotta remember
to tie up your horse, there, chief.

553
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,492
- Okay, K'Wala, just...
Thank you.

554
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,030
- Jonathan?

555
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,197
- Oh... no.

556
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,464
Ma'am.

557
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:29,800
(flute music)

558
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,205
- Sean.

559
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,504
- Two Dogs.

560
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,909
<i>- Hey, Sean,</i>

561
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,312
break's over.
- Whoa!

562
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,475
Whoa! Come on! Come back!

563
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,359
(screaming)

564
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,827
- Hang on.

565
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,069
Hold on. Here you go.

566
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,571
- I'm gonna fall!
- You won't. I won't let you.

567
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,198
Come on. That's it.

568
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,970
I got ya.

569
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,350
See? You're gonna be okay.

570
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,748
(cracking)

571
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,651
That's bad.

572
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,349
(screaming)

573
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,289
- Oh.
- Ah!

574
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,362
(groaning)
- Oh, Lord.

575
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:26,861
- Ow.
- Is it broken?

576
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,488
- Oh, I don't reckon so.

577
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,727
- Pissing elks! It bleeding well is!

578
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,506
(western music)

579
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:43,010
- I think I see why...
you're so convinced

580
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,172
I won't be shootin' that hoof-shaper.

581
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,648
You been conspirin'
to cripple my gun hand.

582
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,219
- If you'd been helping me
like you promised,

583
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:51,844
I wouldn't have fallen.

584
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,052
- That what happened
to your husband?

585
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,185
Did you accidentally kill him
while he was tendin' to the chores?

586
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,658
- It wasn't an accident.

587
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,495
- What?

588
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,466
- It wasn't an accident.

589
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:11,806
I thought we came out here
to start a farm and a family.

590
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,504
Turns out that put the fear in him.

591
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,877
Took to wearing that gun,

592
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,779
swaggering around like some...

593
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,351
dime-novel jackass.

594
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,149
He became a horrible drunk, too.

595
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,189
Then, one day,

596
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:32,023
I realized I could run the farm
a hell of a lot easier by myself.

597
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,596
So I shot him.

598
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,494
- You shot him?

599
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,501
- Yeah.

600
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,904
With his own gun.

601
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,506
Square in the gut.

602
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,206
Now, if you know
anything about killing -

603
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,041
and I'm sure that you do -

604
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:53,708
you'll know that a gut shot
is the ugliest way to do it.

605
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,342
Took him... hours to die.

606
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,019
- Hmm...

607
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,294
(grunting)

608
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,824
- 'Afternoon, Larry!

609
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:11,093
- Howdy, Jane!

610
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:12,930
Hey, Sean!

611
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,172
- Better hop to it
if you're gonna make it by 6:00!

612
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,869
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'll see ya there!

613
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,479
(music)

614
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:33,687
- Aristotle said,
"We are what we do repeatedly.

615
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,019
We do not act rightly because..."
- This ain't a social,

616
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,151
this is schoolin'.
- I never said it was a social,

617
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,355
I said "gathering."
- And it cost you two bits

618
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:41,863
you paid to listen...
- Shhh!

619
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,557
- Mm... What is wrong
with these people?

620
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,726
...The very truth
of who we are as people

621
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,997
is defined by what we do
again and again.

622
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,198
Aristotle would say

623
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,674
that since Larry farms every day,
Larry is a farmer.

624
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,403
- Far-mer.

625
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,808
- Yes.

626
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,677
And one who teaches every day

627
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,613
is therefore a teacher.
- Tea-cher.

628
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,343
(laughter)
- Aristotle would also say

629
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:05,114
it is about who we are as people.

630
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:08,555
A man might claim to be virtuous,

631
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:12,459
but he is not virtuous unless
he consistently acts with great virtue.

632
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:13,996
Yes, Jack.

633
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:18,227
- So let's say a man shoots 11 men
and then he says

634
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:21,133
each man deserves to die,
according to, um...

635
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,297
- Aristotle.
...A- Aristotle,

636
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:26,205
is he still a common killer?

637
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,508
- What'd you just call me?

638
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,705
- Killer.
- No, before that.

639
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,975
- Common.
- Yeah, that's it.

640
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:36,018
You just stepped over the line, again.

641
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:37,313
Outside.

642
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,820
(coughing): Unarmed.

643
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,516
- What is that? You cough,
you say "unarmed."

644
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,320
Do you think I can't hear that?
- Sean?

645
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:47,454
Is there something you would like
to add to this discussion?

646
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,633
- Kil-ler.
- All right, stop. That's enough.

647
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,793
- Sean?

648
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:55,828
- Look,

649
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,407
I see fit to live by a code.

650
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,909
By a set of unspoken laws that men -
real men - understand.

651
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:06,312
Now, just 'cause I got the mettle
to stand up and make things square,

652
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,884
that's not a reason
to brand me common,

653
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,284
I don't care what that book says.

654
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,151
- Common, uncommon
you're still a killer,

655
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,088
and you're set on killing me.

656
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,421
- He's not killing anyone.
- Oh, yes,

657
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,256
I am.
- Oh, believe him,

658
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,332
Mrs. Taylor, that gun'll get fixed
and he'll call me out.

659
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,661
And we all know damn good and well

660
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,667
that I don't stand a chance.

661
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,499
He'll shoot me dead.

662
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,233
And there's nothing uncommon
about that.

663
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,865
<i>I'll just be number 12.
- Well, Canadian Monthly</i>

664
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,036
would technically make you seven.
- At least I know I'll be going

665
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,807
to a better place
than you'll ever see!

666
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:40,382
- You don't know nothin' about me.

667
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,453
- Darn it! I...

668
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,957
I can see right inside you.
It's as plain

669
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,562
as that Colt
you like to wear on your hip.

670
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,962
Gun's a magnet for death.
Hell, some would say

671
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,658
you're lookin' to die.

672
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,000
("laughing")

673
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,296
- That's just wrong.

674
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,841
A gun is just a tool.
It's like...

675
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,807
any other tool.

676
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,106
- A tool designed for killin' people.

677
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:13,307
- No, it's all what you do with it.
- Well, yes.

678
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:16,648
But if a man walks into my shop
with a shovel, I don't think: Oh!

679
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,254
He might kill me!
- Shovel could kill you.

680
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,254
He could hit you on the head with it.

681
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,325
- Or jab you.
- You could say that about anything.

682
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,951
About a rock, even.
- But nobody ever comes in with a rock.

683
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,586
Besides, a rock is not a tool.

684
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,926
- Tell the Indians that.
They've been using rocks as tools

685
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,590
for years.
- Yeah, you could smash somebody

686
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,794
in the face with a rock.
- Or jab someone.

687
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,167
- Can't stab somebody with a rock.
- Tell the Indians.

688
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,638
They've been stabbing people with rocks
for years.

689
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,176
- What about a rope?
Hitting and jabbing somebody

690
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,542
with a rope wouldn't do anything.
- Don't be so sure.

691
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,273
- You could strangle someone
with a rope.

692
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,613
- You could take it and rub it
over somebody's eye, pushing hard.

693
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,444
(military drum cadence)

694
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,689
- Ahem.

695
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,692
Tell me somethin'.

696
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:03,289
Is this entire country insane,
or is it just this town?

697
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,061
- Seems you have quite a history.
- Oh.

698
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,830
Oh, I see.
You've come to run me out of town.

699
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,439
- Mm.

700
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,336
- You haven't broken any laws
in this country.

701
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:12,874
And as far as we're aware,

702
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,706
there are no extradition warrants
out for your arrest.

703
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:19,213
- So I'm free to go about my business?
- As for this...

704
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,410
showdown with Jack
everyone's talking about,

705
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,748
you best know
there are no duelling laws

706
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,857
in this country.
We call it murder.

707
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,386
(door opening)

708
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,019
Don't you dare to even hurt her,
Mr. Kid.

709
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:37,399
'Evening!
Company's having a dance Saturday

710
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,526
to welcome the new provincial
constabulary to the area.

711
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,231
Opportunity to wear that
lovely blue dress again, Miss Taylor.

712
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,899
- That's so sweet
that you remember, Jonathan!

713
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,510
- Well, not something you forget.

714
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,272
- Well, thank you, Corporal.

715
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:53,281
I will definitely try to attend.
- Okay.

716
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,509
Ah!

717
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,917
- What do you say, shear pin?

718
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,785
Can you dance?
- Oh. I'm sorry to disappoint, ma'am,

719
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:04,019
but I intend
to be a charmin' memory by then.

720
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,719
- Hope to see you Saturday.

721
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,024
All are welcome.

722
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,496
Sir.

723
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:13,002
(western music)

724
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:22,839
(up-tempo western music)

725
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,860
(music fading)
(dog barking)

726
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,764
- Just...

727
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,563
answer...

728
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,502
question!
Seen... him?!

729
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,971
<i>Seen him?!</i>

730
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,668
(barking)
- You find that distracting?

731
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,904
- Yes!
- I know I do.

732
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,440
(dog whimpering)
I did.

733
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,312
Now, let me explain.

734
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,281
We are business folk.

735
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:07,856
We catch bad men.

736
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:10,517
And we get paid for our efforts.

737
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,219
That man in particular

738
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,332
is worth a considerable sum
to our enterprise.

739
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,957
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

740
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,366
Have you seen this man?
(man speaking Chinese)

741
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,530
- He say we see no one!

742
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,005
No one!

743
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,736
(mockingly): No one, no one...

744
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,743
(slow suspenseful music)

745
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,673
She has.

746
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,945
Get her.
(woman screaming)

747
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:46,923
- Oh, yeah, Cutler's on our trail.
I can feel him.

748
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,760
We gotta change tack.

749
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,301
All right, here's the plan.

750
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,462
We'll ride east...

751
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,733
and then south.

752
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,538
When Cutler picks up the scent,
which he will,

753
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,340
he will start northwest.

754
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,175
He always sweeps northwest.
Why?

755
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:08,774
Because he is stupid
and he is predictable and, well...

756
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,319
ever since I shot his ear off,

757
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:14,356
he kinda...
he kinda leans to the left.

758
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,186
(horse snorting)

759
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:17,658
What?

760
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:27,437
(donkey braying)

761
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,562
(Jane shouting)

762
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,902
(soft music)

763
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,344
(sighing)

764
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,349
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

765
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,789
We will stay just...
just a little bit longer,

766
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,188
but it has got to be said...

767
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:53,592
It has got to be said, Glue,
that you are getting very soft.

768
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,824
I mean, very, very soft.
Yes.

769
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,140
You know, nothin' should surprise me
around here,

770
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:09,973
but that is a, uh... peculiar perch

771
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,844
upon which to take
one's evening coffee.

772
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,581
Ah.

773
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,812
You're all right?

774
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:25,994
Well...

775
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,825
...it's a nice spot.

776
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,369
- I feel safe up here.

777
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,872
It's where I'd come
when Stewart got drunk.

778
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,373
Yes. Yeah, that part was true.

779
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,844
- Oh.

780
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,684
- And when he got real mean,
I'd just pull the ladder up and wait.

781
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:53,654
He'd be too liquored
to climb up after me.

782
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,516
In the months
before he left for good...

783
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,963
...he'd say
that I wasn't even worth the effort.

784
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,331
Do you like that?

785
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:07,301
Not even worth the effort to beat.

786
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,304
(laughing)

787
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,814
What Jack said in the schoolhouse...

788
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,186
Well, was he right about you?

789
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:27,347
(snorting softly)

790
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,482
Are you looking to get killed?

791
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,986
(snorting softly)

792
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:45,271
- What would one wear
to a Northwest Mounted shindig?

793
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,001
(soft guitar music)

794
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,145
(slow western music)

795
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,619
Oh...

796
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,482
You look...

797
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,424
You look very...

798
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,233
The cart's ready.

799
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,339
- You look rather presentable yourself.

800
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:22,502
But I was growing quite fond
of the Oriental look.

801
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,170
- Well, thank you.

802
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:29,013
I had to eat an entire crate of snails
before Carl'd give me the loan of this.

803
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,986
- I don't know if that makes me
flattered or alarmed.

804
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,160
(slow western music)

805
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,660
(music fading)

806
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,007
(music playing in the distance)

807
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,115
(reel music)
- Whoo!

808
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,959
(drink spilling)
- Ah!

809
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,994
- Sorry.

810
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:19,500
Pardon me.

811
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,263
- Whoa!
(Jane giggling)

812
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,133
- It's my father's.

813
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,476
Ahem.

814
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,004
'Evening, Miss Taylor.
- Ah!

815
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,242
- So pleased that you could attend.

816
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:37,251
- Why, thank you for inviting us,
Jonathan.

817
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,282
- Us?

818
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,016
- Ah, General.
(woman): Whoo!

819
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:45,424
- Oh, uh, hello, Sean.

820
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,422
Good that you could come.

821
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:54,167
- Aren't you lookin' right regal.
You know, it's a particular breed of man

822
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,568
who can carry off an outfit like that.
- Huh.

823
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,369
- So, Corporal, did...

824
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,909
you want to show me
the dance floor?

825
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,881
- It's an old saying,
but true nonetheless:

826
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,177
You dance with who brung you.

827
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,309
So, you two, please,

828
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:13,287
be my guests.
We'll chat later.

829
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,294
(cheering)

830
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,367
- Hello, Beatrice! Hello, Larry!

831
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,233
- Oh, howdy, Jane. Sean.

832
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,068
Wow, aren't you two a sight.

833
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,768
- I'm so pleased to see you both.

834
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,072
- It's all I could do to tear him away

835
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,147
from that damn stump.

836
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,772
- Hey, American.

837
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,014
- Oh, I see you brought your pie.

838
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,617
- You armed?

839
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,927
- I've got pie.

840
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,694
- 'Cause you know it's against the law
for a foreign national

841
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:34,065
to carry a weapon
in Her Majesty's military posts.

842
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,604
- Yeah, I heard.
Hey, whoa, mind the haunch.

843
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,867
- No gun.
- You know what we do

844
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,239
to murderers
who ride up into our country?

845
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:44,211
- I never committed murder
against no man.

846
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:46,983
(wheezing)

847
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:48,675
(coughing and panting)

848
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,811
- I thought you Canadians
were supposed to be polite.

849
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,789
- Ah!

850
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,724
- Ten hut!
(grunting)

851
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,663
(panting)
- Ooh.

852
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:06,632
Howdy, General.

853
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,296
- What's happened here?

854
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,307
- Just a little Northwest warning
to our guest... sir.

855
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:16,469
- Warning? This man
is under no legal restriction here.

856
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,274
- Corporal, he's the Montana Kid.

857
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,508
Best send his type a clear message...

858
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,515
sir.

859
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,454
- Not on my watch.

860
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:26,749
(Sean grunting)

861
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,551
- It's not just about rules, Jonathan.

862
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,887
Why don't you go cross-reference
the troop manifest or...

863
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,188
something?

864
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,799
- Mr. Lafferty, would you like
to register a formal complaint

865
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:39,026
against Constable Hughes?
I would be happy

866
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,898
to issue a statement as your witness.

867
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:45,372
- No. Only thing I'd like
to register is: He hits like a girl.

868
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:48,335
- Then,

869
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,106
this unfortunate incident...

870
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,045
is closed.

871
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,822
Now pick up that pie.

872
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:01,355
- Ooh!

873
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:02,856
(coughing)

874
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:05,359
(reel music)
- Corporal?

875
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,827
General?
Jonathan, come here.

876
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,203
- On behalf of the superintendent
and all officers under his command,

877
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,827
I want to apologize...

878
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:18,338
- I need your help here, Jonathan.

879
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,875
Would you, uh...
take over for me?

880
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:24,503
I fear that Mrs. Taylor here
will be plenty disappointed.

881
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:27,378
I banged my knee up
on a little, uh...

882
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,075
alfresco dancing lesson.

883
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,219
- Y-yes.

884
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:33,720
Uh, yes.

885
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:36,291
It would be my honour and privilege.

886
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:40,193
- Mm... Mm, laudanum.

887
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,695
- Ma'am.

888
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,035
(slow music)

889
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,506
- Tsk. 'Evening, Jack.

890
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:04,978
- 'Evening.

891
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,146
How goes the repairs
on that old Patterson?

892
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:12,312
- It's coming along just fine, Jack.

893
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,456
- Hmm.

894
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:36,806
(Jane giggling)
- That was the most fun I've had

895
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:39,882
in a long, long, long, long...
(hiccupping)

896
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:41,381
...time.

897
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,679
You know, you are looking
pretty spry

898
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,050
for someone with a...
banged-up leg.

899
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,384
- Hmm.
(Jane laughing)

900
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:49,856
Ooh.

901
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,530
(laughing)

902
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,894
- You know, what you did back there
was very kind.

903
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,499
Some might even say...

904
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,133
it was noble.

905
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:11,113
(soft music)

906
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,144
- Again, I, uh...

907
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,153
...I wanna thank you
for inviting me to your stomp.

908
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,853
I should tend that horse.

909
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,484
(Jane guffawing)

910
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,260
- You're unarmed,

911
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,196
Montana Kid.

912
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,824
- Ahem. Jane...

913
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,832
...you don't wanna start this.
- Yeah, I do.

914
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:41,538
I think it's best that you yield,

915
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:43,373
and take it...

916
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,003
like a man.

917
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,340
(soft music)

918
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,133
(rooster crowing in distance)

919
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,972
(soft music)

920
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,524
(panting)

921
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,868
- Ah... g'day, Sean.

922
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,304
- Are you really tryin' to get rid
of that big old beast,

923
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,137
or you just dodgin' the missus?

924
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:50,212
- I've been keen to get rid of her.
(panting)

925
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,247
The stump, I mean.
- Oh.

926
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,818
Think I might be able
to give you a hand with that.

927
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:57,886
- Ah, thanks, Sean.

928
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,387
Yeah... Hell, yeah.

929
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,616
That would be greatly appreciated.

930
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,787
(western music)

931
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,298
(straining)

932
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,815
- Good morning, Sean.
- Good mornin'.

933
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,217
- Good morning, Sean.
Great fun last night.

934
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,693
But it looks like they took your gun
at the fort.

935
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,355
It's a shame.
- Uh, no, they didn't, actually.

936
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,401
I guess I just forgot to strap it on.

937
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,641
(hissing)

938
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,215
(sighing)

939
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:23,798
(sighing)
- Jack.

940
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,300
- Hoof looks good.

941
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:45,759
'Afternoon, Miss Alice.

942
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:47,590
- Good day, Jack.

943
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:00,540
We are what we do, Sean.

944
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,644
A blacksmith smiths iron.

945
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:15,952
(slow western music)

946
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,817
- I...

947
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,319
I made dinner.

948
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:21,855
I thought maybe...
we could eat in my cabin.

949
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:26,160
- No, thank you.
I'm gonna be ridin' out in the morning.

950
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,854
- I thought that maybe...

951
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:30,724
...you'd wanna stay a bit.

952
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,335
- You thought wrong.

953
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,403
Everyone around here did.

954
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:03,822
(soft music)

955
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,819
- We had a deal.

956
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,027
Hey!

957
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,359
You get your gunfight
after my windmill

958
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,024
is up and running.

959
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,982
You tell me why.

960
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:09,264
I mean, why can't you just...

961
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,026
let it go?

962
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,828
- 'Cause I can't.

963
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,898
'Cause if I let it go now, then...

964
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,943
I should've let it go
when them three guys in Missouri

965
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,069
called me a cheat.
And you tell me,

966
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,443
they died for nothing?

967
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:29,380
And if I let them guys in Missouri go,
then...

968
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,977
I should've let it go
when that man was whuppin' that dog.

969
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,852
Now, does that sound right to you?

970
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,017
Beatin' on a helpless dog?

971
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,965
If I was able

972
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,069
to let that man go
for beatin' on that mutt,

973
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,693
then...
(sighing)

974
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:51,068
...there sure as hell is no reason...

975
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:55,234
I couldn't have just walked away
when I was called out in Wyoming,

976
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,245
or Santa Fe and...

977
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,871
twice in Arizona.

978
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,277
If I was so damn smart
to walk away

979
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:08,754
when I was called out,
then I should've had the wherewithal

980
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,689
to not use my gun in self-defence -
twice.

981
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,887
(sighing)
And if I should've been able

982
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,396
to avoid that,
then there's no arguable reason

983
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:19,160
why I couldn't have
just gone to the sheriff...

984
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:22,066
instead of killin' that man
that whupped my pa.

985
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:25,140
- I thought he shot your pa.

986
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,333
- Just beat him up.

987
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:32,011
Broke his jaw and a bloody nose, but...

988
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:37,050
"Taught a common thief a lesson,"
he said.

989
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:38,676
How do you like that?

990
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:43,522
Common.

991
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,022
He was anything but common.

992
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,966
He was my pa.

993
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:57,495
When I shot that man...

994
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,505
(sighing)

995
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:02,873
...like it or not,

996
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:05,276
this is my path.

997
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,379
This is what I do.

998
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,315
And I am what I do.

999

Your clothes look nice.

1010
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:48,381
- Oh, Miss Adell,

1011
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:51,486
I reckon we're lookin'
at the Montana Kid.

1012
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:59,484
- Get it on your belt.

1013
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,722
You go home.
- But...

1014
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,422
why?

1015
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,227
- I said go home now.

1016
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:06,801
- All right.

1017
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,711
- You did a hell of a job,
I'll give you that.

1018
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,579
This was a mess.

1019
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:25,380
(sighing)
- Put it in your belt.

1020
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:27,955
When you pull back,
don't jam your thumb in the hammer.

1021
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,853
You'll blow your nuts off.

1022
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:32,620
- Sage advice, but I don't think that...

1023
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,731
- I said get in the house now!!!

1024
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:41,003
- Just plain mean, you son of a bitch!

1025
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:43,869
- Yeah...

1026
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:46,474
now you're gettin' in the spirit.

1027
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:50,744
All right...

1028
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,848
throw down.

1029
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,282
- You'll kill me.

1030
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:58,683
- I said draw, Jack.

1031
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:01,288
- Well, what about Jane?

1032
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:08,759
- Look about you, Jack.

1033
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:13,332
People around here been hankerin'
to see a man shot dead in the street.

1034
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,061
Best not disappoint. So...

1035
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:18,105
pull your weapon.

1036
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,770
Pull it.

1037
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,011
(slow western music)

1038
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,638
Pull it.

1039
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,660
Point it!

1040
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:48,096
Cock the hammer.

1041
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,499
Cock that gun, or I swear
the next one'll blow your head off.

1042
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,507
(cocking)

1043
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,479
Pull it.

1044
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,817
Do it!

1045
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,986
Do it!!!
- I am!

1046
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:11,116
- Pull it harder!

1049
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:18,490
- Goddamn.

1050
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,033
It was workin' fine

1051
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:22,899
last night. I don't...

1052
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,506
The short stroke?

1053
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,835
Did you pull the hammer
all the way back?

1054
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:28,944
- Yes.
- Well, maybe...

1055
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:32,070
Sometimes these conversions,
they get kinda fiddly.

1056
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:35,240
Get all grimed up, you know, with...

1057
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:38,548
- Oh!
- Oh, there we go.

1058
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:39,949
- Ow.

1059
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:41,351
Ooh.

1060
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,186
- Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

1061
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:45,350
- Ooh.

1062
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:47,621
Oh...

1063
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:51,255
Ow!!!
- There's more in there.

1064
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,868
Bullet fragmented.
- I'm really sorry, Jack.

1065
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:55,595
- Doc! What happened?!

1066
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:00,305
Oh, thank God. I thought you...

1067
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:02,377
(Jack groaning)

1068
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,838
You shot Jack?!

1069
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:09,683
You no-good, poxy, bilious...

1070
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:11,081
- Ja...

1071
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,687
...son of a weasel!

1072
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:14,790
- Whoa!

1073
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,619
- Hey! Just... Hey...

1074
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,989
Stop. Stop. Stop it. Stop it.

1075
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,527
This was an accident.

1076
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:22,062
- An accident?
- Yeah.

1077
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:23,631
- Oh, thank God.

1078
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,667
- Oh, yes, imagine my relief
at being shot in the ass -

1079
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:28,997
by accident!

1080
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:31,868
- Wait a minute.
This puts you square with Jack.

1081
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:33,565
Code-of-the-West-wise.

1082
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:36,337
- Mm, I suppose so.

1083
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,006
- Suppo... You suppose?!
You shot me in the ahhh!!!

1084
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:43,015
(groaning)

1085
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:44,915
- What?
(hooves thundering)

1086
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:46,453
What is it?

1087
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,056
- Horses and guns.

1088
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,885
That's bad.
- Who is it?

1089
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:51,492
Do you know them?

1090
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:54,528
- Ben Cutler, bounty hunter, murderer,
tenacious bastard.

1091
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:58,861
<i>I'm surprised you haven't read about him
in Canadian Monthly.</i>

1092
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,299
- There's four of them,
you damn fool. Are you that good?

1093
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,268
(Sean mumbling): I don't know.
- Run.

1094
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:06,698
I want you to go. Please.

1095
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:09,140
Please.

1096
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:16,378
(shouting in distance)

1097
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:19,181
- Alrighty. Give me 15 minutes
and send them in the same direction.

1098
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,482
I'll lead them outta here so far,
they won't come back.

1099
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,114
And don't leave this house.

1100
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:26,285
(screaming)

1101
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,957
(shouting in distance)

1102
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:42,603
(clicking tongue)

1103
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:49,275
Come on, you deaf mule.
I'm doing the clicking thing.

1104
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:51,750
Come on.
(clicking tongue)

1105
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:54,879
(horse snorting)
(western music)

1106
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,525
(speaking Chinese)

1107
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,025
- They're lyin'.

1108
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:10,070
Montana Kid was seen
wearing Chinaman clothes.

1109
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,606
- Get outta here, both of you!

1110
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,572
He's here all right, Ben.

1111
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,008
Name's written in this here book.

1112
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:18,670
- All right...

1113
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:24,777
No more lies.

1114
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,320
Where is he?

1115
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:29,947
- Go...
- Where is he?!

1116
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:33,027
(speaking Chinese)
Spit it out!

1117
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:37,923
- Jane! D-don't!

1118
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,026
(western music)

1119
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,391
(man shouting in Chinese)

1120
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,054
- We are business folk.

1121
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:11,223
And I will not abide...

1122
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:15,701
...by anyone's purposeful

1123
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,829
undermining of our venture.

1124
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:22,333
So I'll start with the Chinaman.

1125
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:24,673
If I don't get satisfaction,

1126
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:27,941
we will work our way
through his family,

1127
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,415
one by one, until I do.

1128
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:32,520
Question is plain.

1129
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,654
Where's the Montana Kid?

1130
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:41,719
Kick it.

1131
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:44,225
- Anyone touches that chair,

1132
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:47,494
and I'll put a bullet in your other ear!

1133
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:52,571
(laughing)

1134
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,198
- Calm down, there, ma'am.

1135
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:56,208
(cocking hammer)

1136
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,605
(cocking)
(cocking)

1137
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,411
- He's long gone. Days ago.

1138
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:08,555
Why don't you go back
from where you came?

1139
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,223
- She's lyin'. Kick the chair.

1140
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,327
(cocking)
- Don't!

1141
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,399
- I count four, Ben.

1142
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,214
- You want gunplay?!

1143
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:40,214
Is that what you want?!

1144
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,689
I will bleed this town
till I find him!

1145
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:58,569
(cocking)

1146
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,504
(cocking slowly)

1147
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,572
(slow suspenseful music)

1148
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:09,678
(music fading)
(spurs jingling)

1149
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:12,476
(western music)

1150
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:17,789
- Oh no.

1151
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:19,484
- Ben!

1152
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,532
(cocking)

1153
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:29,132
- No more.

1154
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:31,171
It ends here.

1155
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,808
Doc, Jane, everybody -
put your guns down.

1156
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:38,606
- We can do this!

1157
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,476
- There'll be no more killin'.

1158
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,245
Not one shot.

1159
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:48,451
I'm going with you.

1160
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:52,424
- We-we can't let you do that, Sean.
- Yes, you can.

1161
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,897
I've run long enough.

1162
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:59,762
I've seen enough blood spilled
on my account.

1163
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:02,996
You tell your boys, Ben, we're done.

1164
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:04,366
Done shootin'.

1165
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:08,135
I'm comin' with you.
- It's a trick.

1166
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:19,211
- Get the leg irons.

1167
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:26,792
- Doc?

1168
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,124
- Well, Jane, he... he wants to go, eh?

1169
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:34,499
- Okay, then. On the count of three,
everyone lowers their weapons.

1170
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:36,835
One...

1171
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:43,971
...two...

1172
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:53,385
(laughing maniacally)

1173
01:14:57,926 --> 01:14:58,950
...three.

1174
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:01,696
(gunfire)
- Whoa!

1175
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:04,323
Whoa! Cease fire!

1176
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:07,094
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop!

1177
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:09,227
Cease fire, I said!

1178
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:11,430
Cease fire!

1179
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:13,700
Hold it! Cease fire!

1180
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:17,301
Three! I said three!

1181
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,777
(music)
(whistling)

1182
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,176
(whinnying)
No, no, no!

1183
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:28,482
Down, down!
(rousing western music)

1184
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:45,530
- Go around! Get behind him!

1185
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:49,170
- Rats. Sean!

1186
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:57,952
- Sorry!

1187
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:01,246
- Here he comes!

1188
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,328
- Oh! Damn!

1189
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,067
- Grandpa!

1190
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:21,242
Sean!!!

1191
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,141
(music slowing)

1192
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:48,732
(music fading)

1193
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,373
(cocking)

1194
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:58,405
(panting)

1195
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:01,277
(cocking)
- Stay back.

1196
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:06,417
- Just... hold it!

1197
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:12,386
I have gone to considerable effort here
to head off any killin' today.

1198
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:16,395
Ben, we been doin' this for too long.
Ten years - too long.

1199
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:18,431
Me chasin' you, you chasin' me,

1200
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:20,125
and, well, me...

1201
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:24,470
...shootin' that ear of yours
almost clean off your head.

1202
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:27,541
- I'm disfigured!
- Yeah, I... I know. I'm sorry.

1203
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:29,667
But, you know, what's done is done.
Enough's enough.

1204
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:32,302
Except if you kill her,

1205
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:34,677
you know damn well
I'll shoot you dead.

1206
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:38,149
And I... I really don't want it
to come to that.

1207
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:42,089
Uh... you know, I'm...

1208
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:44,692
trying to... to change,

1209
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:47,693
to not be doing these...
the things that I used to do

1210
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:50,798
the way I did them
and to try and...

1211
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:53,628
change into becomin' that person
that I'm gonna...

1212
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:55,259
- What?!

1213
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,329
- Forget it.

1214
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,004
It's complicated.

1215
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,510
(grunting)
And you...

1216
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:17,354
You pull that trigger,
and you'll pray you never did.

1217
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:20,154
Killin' a man's
not something you can undo.

1218
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,990
It'll eat at you.

1219
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,859
Till you hate everything

1220
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,490
about that one moment in time.

1221
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:28,125
Including me.

1222
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:31,300
I couldn't live with that.

1223
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:34,631
So please...

1224
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,323
(laughing)

1225
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:58,925
- You ain't worth the bullet.
- Oh, ho-ho.

1226
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:02,127
She is most definitely worth a bullet.
- Hey!

1227
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:05,205
- No, I didn't mean that way...
- You, on the other hand,

1228
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,240
are worth 4,000 dead or alive!

1229
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:10,572
This time I think it prudent...

1230
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,304
...to go dead.
(gunshot)

1231
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:16,315
Oh! Christmas crackers!
(groaning)

1232
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:19,249
- You supposin' we're square now?!

1233
01:19:20,789 --> 01:19:22,780
- Yeah. Yeah, I reckon so.

1234
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:24,686
- Good.

1235
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:29,195
Now you can finish patchin' up
my whatchamacallit.

1236
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,799
- Gluteus.
- Damn right. Come on.

1237
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:41,306
- Huh?

1238
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:44,605
Ah, the gunfight?

1239
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:47,010
You had the gunfight!

1240
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,741
Ah, no! Would you...?

1241
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:51,352
I missed it! I missed it!

1242
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:53,181
Son of a...!

1243
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:54,811
(jaunty flute music)

1244
01:19:56,892 --> 01:19:59,520
- Each of you
has a writ of expatriation

1245
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:01,253
and a notice of intent

1246
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:03,694
to charge and detain.

1247
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:05,993
- Writ of what?

1248
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:09,365
- It means I will graciously escort
your smelly hides out of the country,

1249
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:13,065
and if you even think of returning,
will show you one of Her Majesty's...

1250
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:14,607
hoosegows!

1251
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:16,210
- What's a hoosegow?

1252
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:17,641
(chuckling)

1253
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:20,504
- Shut up.

1254
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:26,044
- Hoosegow.
What the hell's a hoosegow?

1255
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:27,177
- Ahem.

1256
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:29,290
Ahem-hem-hem! Mm.

1257
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:36,489
(soft western music)

1258
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:49,866
- Thank you.

1259
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:00,544
(indistinct chatter)

1260
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:04,156
(music)

1261
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:27,413
(music fading)

1262
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:31,846
- I guess this is the part where
you become a charming memory.

1263
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,354
- Not quite. Uh...

1264
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:37,619
turns out there's a fair bit of debt
that has to be satisfied

1265
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:40,353
before I can leave this, uh...
this town.

1266
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:45,298
(groaning softly)

1267
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,731
I owe for...

1268
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:49,336
nine bullets, one teacup,

1269
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:50,904
one shear pin,

1270
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:52,404
one case of snails,

1271
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,405
one carrot,

1272
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:56,373
laundry and sewing services...

1273
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:01,377
...four horseshoes,
one portrait of a ugly lady,

1274
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:03,347
one bag of cats...

1275
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:04,952
Wait a minute.

1276
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:06,610
Oh, that's oats.

1277
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,349
(laughing)
One gluteus bullet extraction -

1278
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:12,551
mine was gratis,
but not Jack's, apparently -

1279
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:15,060
and, uh... the repair

1280
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:18,188
of roughly 100 bullet holes.

1281
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,699
- It could take some time.
- Mm-hmm.

1282
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:24,134
Frankly, I don't see
how I got saddled with the cost

1283
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:26,433
of the shear pin.
It's your windmill.

1284
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:35,677
(soft music)

1285
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:51,029
(music)

1286
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:55,694
- Yeah!

1287
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:02,541
(music)

1288
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:05,102
- Do I still get your horse?

1289
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:07,137
- What is wrong with you people?

1290
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:13,015
<i>Don't let the darkness</i>

1291
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:15,588
<i>In your head</i>

1292
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:27,359
<i>All the love you meant to share</i>

1293
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,493
<i>You shared</i>

1294
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:40,174
<i>All the tears we'll never hear</i>

1295
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:48,114
<i>And all the dreams that disappear</i>

1296
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:53,892
<i>Sometimes you feel so alone</i>

1297
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:56,520
<i>In the shadows of regret...</i>

1298
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:02,833
Hey!
(clicking tongue, then whistling)

1299
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:04,336
Click! Click!

1300
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,963
(with strange accent):
Come here to me, horse.

1301
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:09,042
<i>Fuck you, horse.
... In your head</i>

1302
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:11,338
- A Peacemaker.
(clicking tongue)

1303
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:12,946
An Equalizer.

1304
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:15,641
A Widowmaker.
- Stop that.

1305
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:18,685
- A Peacemaker...
Yeah, an Equalizer.

1306
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:21,186
The... the... the... the, uh...

1307
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:22,846
the Womanizer.

1308
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:24,322
(guffawing)

1309
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:27,325
(laughter)

1310
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:31,695
- Yesterday, I lost my hat,
so this is no fuckin' good.

1311
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:33,232
- What the hell?!

1312
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:36,030
Another fucking dust storm!

1313
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:39,038
- I'd like to kill you,
but I cannot see you!

1314
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:42,337
- And they each earned their bullet
of their own accord.

1315
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:47,773
I said that weird,
like with almost a Martian accent.

1316
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:52,546
- That would be a fragrant contravention
of rule 44 of the constables' code

1317
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:54,882
of behaviour, hygiene
and equipment care.

1318
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:56,888
- "Fragrant" contravention?
(laughter)

1319
01:24:57,025 --> 01:24:59,687
- You want the damn showdown,
or not?

1320
01:25:01,963 --> 01:25:03,294
- Hmm.

1321
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:06,164
What were all those other lines?

1322
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:08,292
- You could strangle someone
with a rope.

1323
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:10,495
- Yah. Or pull them to the desert.

1324
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:13,334
- Mm. Tie 'em to a bed.

1325
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:14,965
(laughter)
- Fuck!

1326
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:18,507
(applause)

1327
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:20,443
(laughter)

1328
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,640
(farting noise)

1329
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:29,313
<i>... All the pain
that's messin' up your mind</i>

1330
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:34,522
<i>Makes you feel like</i>

1331
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:36,994
<i>Leavin'you behind</i>

1332
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,769
<i>Sometimes you feel so alone...</i>

1333
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:43,962
(laughter)
- Fucking fuck.

1334
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:47,666
(laughter)
I heard that, Paul.

1335
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:49,606
- This is my path.

1336
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:52,042
This is what I do.

1337
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:54,045
(horse farting)

1338
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:56,707
And that's his path.
That's what he does.

1339
01:25:56,851 --> 01:25:58,512
What he eats, he shits.

1340
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:01,321
He's a horse.

1341
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:03,947
I am a man.
I have a gun.

1342
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:06,322
I do different things.
I kill people.

1343
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:08,895
I shit, too,
but I don't do it the same way.

1344
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:11,931
I don't even lift anything, I just...
have a bowl I sit on.

1345
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:14,364
Sometimes just out in the field
is where I'll shit.

1346
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:15,833
- You lost your carrot?

1347
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:17,767
(laughter)

1348
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:20,340
You lost your rabbit?

1349
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:21,806
(laughter)

1350
01:26:25,747 --> 01:26:27,339

1351
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:28,972
