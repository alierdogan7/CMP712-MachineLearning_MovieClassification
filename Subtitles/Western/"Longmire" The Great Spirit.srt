- San Francisco, Denver.

now, so you want me to head out there?

then tie him to a horse?

Is there some kind of problem?

was held on the property last night.

happen to know about that?

out of the ordinary.

that live in the barracks, though.

us onto some suspects.

you back, you know what I'm saying?

176
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:24,224
Think you know why I'm here, Travis.

177
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,685
Yeah. [Sighs]

178
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,946
Look, I, uh...

179
00:11:32,378 --> 00:11:35,169
I don't have the money
to pay the bank right now.

180
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,271
I got injured in the ring and
had to sit out for a few months.

181
00:11:40,272 --> 00:11:42,417
You know how it is.

182
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:45,035
But look, man, I-I'm
back in the saddle now.

183
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:48,152
And there's a few local venues
that I'm looking to hit up.

184
00:11:48,153 --> 00:11:51,374
Two more days, man. I guarantee
you I'll have the money.

185
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:55,128
You think you could talk to that hard
ass boss of yours, buy me some time?

186
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:56,479
[Sighs]

187
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,964
Yeah.

188
00:11:57,965 --> 00:12:01,635
I can float you the cash till
you get back on your feet.

189
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:04,304
I don't want your charity, man.

190
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:06,355
That's not what this is.

191
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:08,105
I help you...

192
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:09,909
You help me.

193
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,472
Walt mentioned there's an illegal
rodeo that's been operating in the area.

194
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:18,516
You hear when the
next one's happening...

195
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:21,637
Maybe give me a call.

196
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:24,477
Yeah.

197
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:30,880
An illegal rodeo? [Chuckles]

198
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:36,119
I've been the Beltro Corporate Manager for
this area of Wyoming for going on 10 years.

199
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,338
<i>We never had that problem before.</i>

200
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,843
I'm afraid this case is a bit more
complicated than that, Mr. Frier.

201
00:12:42,844 --> 00:12:46,024
Man was found murdered.

202
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:47,777
My God.

203
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:50,538
[Breathes heavily]

204
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:53,146
Oh.

205
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:56,516
That's, uh, Titus Griffin.

206
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:58,109
He, uh...

207
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,591
He's one of our foremen.

208
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:02,646
What happened to him?

209
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:05,314
You know if he had any
family? Wife or children?

210
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:07,450
No. He, uh...

211
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:10,510
He lived alone at the company house.

212
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:14,258
He devoted most of his
time to running the farm.

213
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,159
Paid off, too.

214
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,304
I mean, his...

215
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:21,752
His property's one of the
highest-grossing farms Beltro owns.

216
00:13:21,753 --> 00:13:24,033
I wish I had 10 men like him.

217
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:25,969
Always made me look good.

218
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,246
[Sighs]

219
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:29,581
Sometimes, uh...

220
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:32,206
What makes a man
profitable to a company...

221
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:34,500
Doesn't make him
popular with his workers.

222
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:36,714
You ever have a problem
with any of the laborers?

223
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,478
He took a hard line with them.

224
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:42,064
That's what you do when you're the boss.

225
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:44,120
I mean...

226
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:47,601
All your deputies like you?

227
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,310
Any men that work under
Titus have a record?

228
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:51,291
Well...

229
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:54,058
Field hands don't really
come with references.

230
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:57,061
- You mean they're illegal?
- No, no. [Chuckles]

231
00:13:57,062 --> 00:14:00,315
No, the company has a policy,
strictly forbids that.

232
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:03,415
I just... I mean, the men are seasonal.

233
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,388
And with a transient
labor force you're never...

234
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:09,493
Exactly sure what you're getting.

235
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:12,434
Yeah. Appreciate it.

236
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:17,766
Uh, we need to question all
the men that work under Titus.

237
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,959
I'll... I'll fax you
over a list right away.

238
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,650
Thank you. Sorry.

239
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:23,489
Walt.

240
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,131
So, I just got off with the vet.

241
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:29,109
Um, he says the horse
is gonna be fine but,

242
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,447
he wants to know what
you want to do with it.

243
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:34,349
<i>What I want to do with it?</i>

244
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,216
Yeah, he can only afford to keep
it there a couple days, and...

245
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:40,543
He can try to find her a new home but...

246
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:43,158
Given what that horse
has been through...

247
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:47,671
She may never be okay
for someone to ride.

248
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:49,060
I'll handle it.

249
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:51,461
[Door opens]

250
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,452
How'd the high-school reunion go?

251
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:56,076
Talked to Travis.

252
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:59,123
He managed to come up
with the money he owes.

253
00:14:59,124 --> 00:15:00,666
You're welcome.

254
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:04,447
Victim's name is Titus Griffin.

255
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,732
Ferg, see if you can
track down his next of kin.

256
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:11,686
Titus Griffin, as in
the Foreman for the farm?

257
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:15,416
Seems odd that the boss would be in
an illegal rodeo, don't you think?

258
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:19,443
Maybe Titus tried to put a stop to it.

259
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:23,796
Beltro will be sending a list of all the
men that worked under Titus at the farm.

260
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,053
Vic, I'm gonna need you and Branch
to head out there and question them.

261
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:29,218
I seriously doubt that those
guys are gonna talk to us

262
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,993
about an illegal rodeo
where their boss was killed.

263
00:15:31,994 --> 00:15:35,159
We could just go to the rodeo.

264
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,427
Talked to one of my sources.

265
00:15:37,428 --> 00:15:41,628
There's gonna be another one tonight.

266
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:46,244
[Music]

267
00:15:57,366 --> 00:16:00,366
[Cheers and applause]

268
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,430
Shit.

269
00:16:14,228 --> 00:16:16,448
Vámonos.

270
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:31,600
See if you can find anyone who
saw or spoke with Titus last night.

271
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:37,228
[Music]

272
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:44,276
[Cheers and applause]

273
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:55,747
I saw your shooting.

274
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,988
That was really impressive,
especially from this distance.

275
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:01,060
Thank you. Very kind of you to say.

276
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,476
Did you, uh, do that trick last night?

277
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:05,278
<i>I do the same trick every night.</i>

278
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,652
If you're watching.

279
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,753
[Laughs]

280
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:13,420
Where did you get your
holster? [Chuckles softly]

281
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:14,973
Wow.

282
00:17:14,974 --> 00:17:16,574
<i>I am...</i>

283
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:19,085
<i>Really into leather.</i>

284
00:17:19,086 --> 00:17:22,374
A local man, Javier
Hemendez, made it for me.

285
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,348
You wouldn't happen to, uh,
have his number, by chance?

286
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:29,579
I may want to get a holster of my own.

287
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,860
I don't have his number,
but I can give you mine.

288
00:17:42,491 --> 00:17:45,491
[Cheers and applause]

289
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,757
<i>- You look like the man in charge.
- What do you want?</i>

290
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:05,663
I want to know who's
running this operation.

291
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:08,269
I'm looking to ride.

292
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,169
[Chuckling] Orale!

293
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,501
¿Has oído? Tenemos una celebridad.

294
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:16,851
Branch Connally for
Sheriff quiere montar!

295
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:19,072
[Laughter]

296
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:20,864
We see your signs.

297
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:23,085
[Laughter]

298
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:25,297
Oh!

299
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:27,921
You're famous!

300
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:32,626
[Groans]

301
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:35,126
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

302
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:37,203
Hello, Bob.

303
00:18:37,204 --> 00:18:39,666
Walt. What... what
are you doing out here?

304
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,501
I could ask you the same thing, Bob.

305
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:44,907
Now, I know this place isn't aboveboard,
but my girlfriend really wanted to come,

306
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:47,140
and she's hard to say no to, you know?

307
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:49,559
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah. Her name's Yelena.

308
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,400
Met her at work. She comes in,
cleans the flower shop every week.

309
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:54,656
[Exhales sharply]

310
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:55,970
Anyway...

311
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:58,830
She's friends with a bunch of the
farmers who compete in these events.

312
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:00,854
She likes to come out and
cheer them on, you know?

313
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:03,586
Were you here last night?

314
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:05,942
This gonna get me in trouble?

315
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:09,171
You see this man last night?

316
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:14,090
Yeah. Yep, he was here. Be kind
of hard to forget. He shot a guy.

317
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:15,057
What?

318
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:17,408
He was doing all these trick
shots, you know, like...

319
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:21,324
Shooting cigars out of
people's mouths from horseback.

320
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:23,302
He ended up shooting one of them.

321
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:25,129
The man he shot, he die?

322
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,874
I don't know. Everybody cleared
out of here pretty quick.

323
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,744
I assumed they sent
him to the rodeo doc.

324
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:32,703
Oh, Yelena, I want you to meet Walt
Longmire, a very dear friend of mine.

325
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,688
Nice to meet you. We should go Roberto,
they're saying the Sheriff is here.

326
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:38,157
Oh, you're so sweet when you're worried.

327
00:19:38,158 --> 00:19:39,196
I love you.

328
00:19:39,197 --> 00:19:42,195
Looks like my campaign
advertising is working.

329
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:44,056
Bob!

330
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:48,643
Where do I find this rodeo doctor?

331
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:53,848
Walt: Wyoming State Medical School.

332
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:57,669
Practicing medicine without a license.

333
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,648
[Sighs]

334
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:02,392
- That's a felony, Paul.
- Oh, come on.

335
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:04,162
Look, someone has to
look after those guys,

336
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:06,746
and no legit doctor is going
anywhere near that rodeo.

337
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,939
I don't see why this is such a big deal.

338
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,571
Man named Titus Griffin was
murdered at that rodeo last night.

339
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:16,988
That's a pretty big deal.

340
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:20,188
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

341
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:21,836
What does that have to do with me?

342
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:25,105
He supposedly shot
someone during an event.

343
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:27,613
- You treat anyone with a gunshot wound?
- Yeah, yeah.

344
00:20:27,614 --> 00:20:30,693
Uh, a Mexican guy... Javier Hemendez.

345
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:32,593
Did Javier live?

346
00:20:32,594 --> 00:20:35,169
Yeah, he was lucky. Bullet
caught him in the cheek,

347
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,719
passed clear through...
only took out two teeth.

348
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,676
Listen, I wanted to take him
to the hospital, but Titus...

349
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:43,266
He gave me a wad of cash, he
told me to keep my mouth shut.

350
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:44,212
Titus paid you?

351
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:46,891
Yeah, Titus pays everyone. He's
the guy who puts on the rodeo.

352
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:49,776
Most of the competitors, they
work for him back at the farm.

353
00:20:49,777 --> 00:20:52,545
People pay big money to see
these guys almost kill themselves.

354
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:55,598
Vic: So, Titus works those guys
hard in the fields all day long,

355
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,004
and then he uses them
in his backwoods rodeo?

356
00:20:58,005 --> 00:21:02,205
Lovely. He sounds like a real Prince.

357
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,508
The man that Titus
shot, Javier Hemendez...

358
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:07,752
I heard his name before.

359
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:10,474
A sharpshooter at the
rodeo told me about him.

360
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:12,982
The shooter had a gun belt
with the same symbol on it.

361
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:15,941
He said Javier Hemendez made it for him.

362
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,410
So Titus shoots Javier in the face...

363
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:22,145
Then ends up dead and
tied to Javier's saddle.

364
00:21:22,146 --> 00:21:25,393
I think we ought to find Javier.

365
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:29,272
He's on the list of workers
that Beltro sent over.

366
00:21:29,273 --> 00:21:31,635
Vic, let's go.

367
00:21:31,636 --> 00:21:33,381
Not you, Branch.

368
00:21:33,382 --> 00:21:37,462
Had enough exposure for one evening.

369
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,356
Yeah.

370
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,842
Hey.

371
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:55,847
I need to speak with you privately.

372
00:21:55,848 --> 00:22:01,188
Vic, I'll meet you outside.
I'll just be a minute.

373
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,948
[Sighs]

374
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:12,861
Did you know Detective
Fales was in town?

375
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:16,251
You sure? You saw him here?

376
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:20,705
He came into the Red
Pony, asking for me.

377
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:25,266
He's expecting to
speak with me tomorrow.

378
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,045
I guess we knew this day was coming.

379
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:31,368
You need a lawyer?

380
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:35,546
What I need is for you to tell me
everything that you told Detective Fales.

381
00:22:35,547 --> 00:22:41,447
<i>The slightest contradiction in
our stories, and he will notice.</i>

382
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,989
Cal.

383
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,618
Appreciate you coming in from
town. Sorry to get you out of bed.

384
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:56,134
I heard what happened to Titus.

385
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:58,076
Why didn't you tell me?

386
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,818
We were still piecing things together.

387
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:02,153
There's a man works here
we need to talk to...

388
00:23:02,154 --> 00:23:03,791
Javier Hemendez.

389
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:05,955
Yeah. He lives in the barracks.

390
00:23:05,956 --> 00:23:07,660
You think...

391
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:09,938
You think Javier might've killed him?

392
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:11,338
That surprise you?

393
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:15,962
Come to think of it, he showed up to
work yesterday with a bandage on his face.

394
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:19,196
I guess nothing should
surprise me from them anymore.

395
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,197
- "Them"?
- Illegals.

396
00:23:22,522 --> 00:23:26,584
Louie, uh, Frier told me that hiring
illegals is against company policy.

397
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:28,907
I'm sure that's what he told you.

398
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,725
But hiring illegals is
how he makes his money.

399
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:33,510
Pays them nothing, and
if they don't like it,

400
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:35,779
what are they gonna do, call the police?

401
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,332
How does Titus feel about all this?

402
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,950
Oh, he knew.

403
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:42,304
Probably why he pushed
them harder than he should.

404
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:45,536
Javier's a type of man
who would take revenge?

405
00:23:45,537 --> 00:23:51,437
Push any man too hard, sooner or
later, they're gonna push back.

406
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,854
They were all here when I left.

407
00:24:01,855 --> 00:24:06,715
Couldn't have been more
than three hours ago.

408
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:11,975
Got any idea where they could've gone?

409
00:24:25,354 --> 00:24:26,775
I thought we said tomorrow.

410
00:24:26,776 --> 00:24:28,016
[Chuckles]

411
00:24:28,017 --> 00:24:30,060
We did.

412
00:24:30,061 --> 00:24:32,387
But I kind of lost track of time.

413
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,604
Easy to do in here.

414
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,652
Can I at least offer
you one on the house?

415
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:39,061
- You have been very patient.
- No, no. I'm... I'm good.

416
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:43,521
I actually want to talk to you
about your friend Walt Longmire.

417
00:24:43,522 --> 00:24:49,204
I'm not sure if you know this, but the
man that killed his wife was murdered.

418
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:52,596
Turns out he was some meth head.

419
00:24:52,597 --> 00:24:55,177
[Clears throat]

420
00:24:56,675 --> 00:24:57,879
<i>I had heard that.</i>

421
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,750
We think we got someone on the hook.

422
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:02,672
Who?

423
00:25:02,673 --> 00:25:06,075
Not at Liberty to say, and
in [Chuckling] the meantime,

424
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:10,575
the prosecution's making
me jump through hoops!

425
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:13,800
They want to make sure the defense...

426
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:17,994
Can't point to anyone else as a suspect.

427
00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:20,235
Like your friend the Sheriff.

428
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:21,484
Due diligence.

429
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:25,240
So I was hoping you could help me out.

430
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:27,952
I hear you two are close.

431
00:25:27,953 --> 00:25:29,265
What would you like to know?

432
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:31,965
Walt went to Denver...

433
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:34,588
A few months after his wife's murder.

434
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:36,639
Were you aware of that?

435
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,187
It was around June, if I'm not mistaken.

436
00:25:39,188 --> 00:25:41,924
Since we're on the subject.

437
00:25:41,925 --> 00:25:46,414
<i>Would you mind telling
me why you were in Denver?</i>

438
00:25:46,415 --> 00:25:49,895
Gas-station receipts show...

439
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:55,609
You were there the same
weekend, then again a week later.

440
00:25:56,284 --> 00:25:59,644
I went to help a friend.

441
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:14,089
<i>Which friend?</i>

442
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,206
Ada Black Kettle.

443
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:21,842
She's 80, lives alone. I try
to check in on her when I can.

444
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:26,220
Did you see Walt when
you were in Denver?

445
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:28,117
I did.

446
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:30,256
He was there following
up on his wife's case,

447
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:34,855
making sure the Denver
P.D. was doing its job.

448
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:37,761
Well, I'm sorry I wasn't assigned,

449
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,422
to her case back then, but...

450
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:43,288
I'm here now.

451
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:47,923
Once a case is in my head,
I just can't let it go.

452
00:26:47,924 --> 00:26:52,184
My ex-wife used to call me obsessive.

453
00:26:53,122 --> 00:26:54,963
You sure you do not want a beer?

454
00:26:54,964 --> 00:26:56,764
No.

455
00:26:56,872 --> 00:27:01,132
You look like you've had a long day.

456
00:27:01,176 --> 00:27:04,836
Why don't you have that one?

457
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:11,505
Henry, it's me. Give me a
call back when you get this.

458
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:14,792
Hey, Walt. You wanted to see me?

459
00:27:14,793 --> 00:27:17,367
Yeah. Uh, take a seat.

460
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:21,664
You mentioned your girlfriend knew
some of the competitors from the rodeo.

461
00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:24,161
All those men have disappeared
from the farm where they work.

462
00:27:24,162 --> 00:27:26,066
You think Yelena might
know where they went?

463
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:29,584
[Sighs] Geez, Walt. You know...

464
00:27:29,585 --> 00:27:32,501
We got a good thing going.

465
00:27:32,502 --> 00:27:34,558
Feel kind of weird asking
her something like that,

466
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,558
especially when it's gonna
get her friends in trouble.

467
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:42,121
Bob, I don't really care if these men are
here illegally. That's a federal matter.

468
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:46,527
I'm just trying to solve a murder case.

469
00:27:46,528 --> 00:27:49,113
That company Yelena's friends work for,

470
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:52,239
is bound to notice half their
workers missing, and when they do,

471
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,268
they can call immigration
and have them deported.

472
00:27:55,269 --> 00:28:00,823
If you help me find them first, I might
be able to stop that from happening.

473
00:28:00,824 --> 00:28:04,275
I imagine that would make
Yelena pretty grateful.

474
00:28:04,276 --> 00:28:06,846
You really think she'll see it that way?

475
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:07,798
[Knock on door]

476
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,230
Ferg: Sheriff?

477
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,691
Uh, can I...

478
00:28:13,854 --> 00:28:17,094
Women love a hero, Bob.

479
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:20,690
The bank just called.

480
00:28:20,691 --> 00:28:25,420
They want to know why we haven't taken
possession of Travis Murphy's trailer yet.

481
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:27,245
He hasn't made his payment.

482
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:28,627
Travis? That can't be.

483
00:28:28,628 --> 00:28:31,547
Man will say or do just about
anything to keep his home.

484
00:28:31,548 --> 00:28:34,168
Can't cut corners in this job
just because someone's a friend.

485
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:37,163
I was just trying to give
somebody the benefit of the doubt.

486
00:28:37,164 --> 00:28:38,794
Won't happen again.

487
00:28:38,795 --> 00:28:39,994
Take the damn trailer.

488
00:28:39,995 --> 00:28:43,421
No. You want to be Sheriff, you do it.

489
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,656
- Vic.
- What? What did I do?

490
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:50,097
Go with him. Make sure he gets it done.

491
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:56,747
Managed to sweet-talk her. Here you go.

492
00:28:56,748 --> 00:28:58,616
Ferg. With me.

493
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:01,017
Thanks, Bob.

494
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:15,467
Man towards the front of the camp
with a bandage on his cheek...

495
00:29:15,468 --> 00:29:18,708
Fair bet that's Javier.

496
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:24,553
Ferg: I see him. So, what's the plan?

497
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:30,454
I never thought I'd say this, but I
think I got to be more like Branch.

498
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:36,256
[Man whistles]

499
00:29:36,545 --> 00:29:40,385
Ipolicía! Ila migra estan aquí!

500
00:29:51,568 --> 00:29:53,481
[Indistinct shouting]

501
00:29:53,482 --> 00:29:56,362
[Engine turns over]

502
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:07,934
Get up.

503
00:30:14,524 --> 00:30:18,944
Titus Griffin was shot two nights ago and
tied to a saddle with the same insignia.

504
00:30:18,945 --> 00:30:22,114
I understand he shot you
in the face that same night.

505
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:24,283
Did you return the favor?

506
00:30:24,284 --> 00:30:28,235
No, no, no, no. This was an accident.

507
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:31,555
We do it lots of times
before, nothing happened.

508
00:30:31,556 --> 00:30:34,465
I did not kill him.

509
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,654
Why run away from Beltro Farm, then?

510
00:30:36,655 --> 00:30:38,752
Well, I did not run.

511
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:42,320
A man come to the farm, tell us to go.

512
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:44,392
But we cannot leave Wyoming.

513
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:45,603
Why?

514
00:30:45,604 --> 00:30:47,252
Beltro...

515
00:30:47,253 --> 00:30:51,883
They tell us we can come
here with our families...

516
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:54,284
From Mexico.

517
00:30:54,296 --> 00:30:58,376
They promise us a house and papers.

518
00:30:58,682 --> 00:31:03,602
But when we get here,
they give us no papers.

519
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,980
Beltro tell us we have to pay...

520
00:31:09,627 --> 00:31:12,051
For travel...

521
00:31:12,052 --> 00:31:13,386

Titus didn't seem like
the kind of man would help.

he wasn't a good man.

He bought a saddle from
me so I can make money.

he gave to us to pay our debts.

Of course, consider the source.

What's more interesting to me, though,

581
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:21,040
is that none of those men
had a reason to kill Titus.

582
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:23,691
Turns out he's a big advocate for them.

00:40:41,468 --> 00:40:46,748
What did the first warrior
say to the great spirit?

698
00:40:55,164 --> 00:41:01,044
The first warrior looked out
on the land that was his home.

699
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:04,723
He saw the hills...

700
00:41:04,846 --> 00:41:07,426
And the stars.

701
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:11,385
And he was happy.

702
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:14,911
For giving him this home,

703
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:16,949
the first warrior told
the great spirit that he

704
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:21,870
would fight and win many
battles in his honor.

705
00:41:25,914 --> 00:41:28,674
Time to go home.

706
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:33,923
But the great spirit said, "no".

707
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:37,102
"Do not fight for me".

708
00:41:37,103 --> 00:41:40,283
"Fight for your tribe".

709
00:41:40,475 --> 00:41:44,555
"Fight for the family born to you".

710
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:49,679
"Fight for the brothers you find".

711
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:07,834
"Fight for them," the great spirit said.

712
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,802
"For they are your home".

713
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:15,113
