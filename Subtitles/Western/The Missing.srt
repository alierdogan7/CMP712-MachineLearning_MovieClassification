1
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:35,354
Ma! Señora Nunez came in.
She's burning up with fever.

2
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:38,497
Go cool her head.
Recite the 23rd Psalm.

3
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,189
l'll be there in a bit.

4
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:56,044
New Mexico, 1 885

5
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,618
''Though l walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, l fear no evil.''

6
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,688
-Morning, kids.
-''Thou art with me. Thy rod and staff...

7
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,555
...they comfort me.

8
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:10,355
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

9
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,795
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.

10
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:19,697
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.''

11
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:23,832
Darling, get me some Cocea paste
and my tooth plier, please.

12
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,944
Yes, ma'am.

13
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,011
No. No.

14
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,057
She don't worry about the pain. No.

15
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,820
lt is her only tooth.
She worry how she look.

16
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,827
Thank you.

17
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,100
Thank you.

18
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,547
l need you to hold
your grandmother down.

19
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,240
Darling, can you hold her arm?

20
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,546
Pin that, Dot. Hold her nose.
Hold her nose.

21
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,254
Careful.

22
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,914
l hate to ask...

23
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,919
...but can you pay me for this today?

24
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,739
Jumping <i>pinches</i> coyotes
sons of bitches.

25
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,877
That lightning sure did kill her.

26
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,950
This calf won't last the night out here.
Let's put her in the barn.

27
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,691
Señor Brake.

28
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,098
lndian.

29
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,991
Apache, maybe.

30
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,539
Some kind of Apache
son of a bitch.

31
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,153
Good day, sir.

32
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,166
l said, hello.

33
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,464
That your man over there
in the trees?

34
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,075
What is he planning on doing
with that carbine?

35
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,549
We've had trouble
with coyotes killing calves.

36
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,621
Tell him l'm not a coyote.

37
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,896
ls that the healer's place?

38
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,399
You come for doctoring?

39
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,454
Lady shuts her doors at sundown.

40
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,095
She's pretty firm about her hours.

41
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,202
You're welcome to spend the night,
see her in the morning.

42
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,300
l thank you kindly.

43
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,571
Barn's this way, mister.

44
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,505
There's a spare bunk
over there, Mr....

45
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,569
Mr. Fernandez.

46
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,145
Jones. The man that owned
that saddle tried to kill me.

47
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:59,114
l was living with the Jicarilla. l
suppose he thought l was one of them.

48
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,380
You're Apache, huh?

49
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,013
-What did you say?
-Forget it.

50
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,249
What did you say?

51
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,293
Come over here.

52
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,371
Now, l mean it!

53
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,243
There'll be no trouble here.

54
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:28,608
lf that's too tough for you to
understand, you can move on.

55
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,065
Emiliano, unpack his mule.

56
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,691
You will keep your hands
off of my mule...

57
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,305
...Emiliano.

58
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,117
-Don't slam that door.
-Yes, ma'am.

59
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,560
There are houses in Cleveland
with lamps that run on electricity.

60
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,927
l'd like to see Cleveland.

61
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,137
-Can you fetch the water, please, Dot?
-Yes, ma'am.

62
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:41,285
At the fair, there's gonna be
expositions of the future.

63
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:45,049
There's gonna be a graphophone. You
can hear your own voice back on it.

64
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,655
-The Dickersons are going.
-Brake can't spare you.

65
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,790
-Ma.
-Not tomorrow with the cows calving.

66
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,560
-The Fosters too.
-Got all the future you need right here.

67
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,332
Riding all day with this
cramping and all.

68
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,915
Don't you ever act helpless
and pitiable to win favor with a man.

69
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,350
Some people shouldn't give advice
on how to act with men.

70
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,690
-And it's ''pitiful'' in English.
-You heard what l said.

71
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,127
That pail's half-empty.

72
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:28,063
l didn't do it. lt's that old lndian's
dumb old mule.

73
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,567
-What lndian?
-Some drifter looking for doctoring.

74
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,001
lf you're gonna eat barefoot...

75
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,768
...why not take supper
with the animals in the barn.

76
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,710
My boots don't fit no more.
Cut off my blood circulation.

77
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,282
-lt's your birthday soon.
-l'll have gangrene by then.

78
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:50,252
Your mother may have to saw off your
feet, then. Like poor old Mr. Swenson.

79
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,659
Mr. Jones.

80
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,124
Maggie, this is the visiting gentleman
l mentioned.

81
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,129
l'll bet a warm meal
sounds pretty good to you.

82
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,276
Magdalena.

83
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,248
l'm afraid we have
just enough food for family.

84
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,820
We can't be offering
our hospitality tonight.

85
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,332
-l'm sure we can all do with less.
-l'm sure we can't!

86
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,072
l have two growing girls to feed.

87
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,169
Maggie?

88
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,477
Maggie.

89
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,782
Lilly, why don't you say grace.

90
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,329
Who is he?

91
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,341
Called you Magdalena.

92
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,940
Your hair bristles
when you lay eyes on him.

93
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,946
He scares me, is all.

94
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:29,183
-Nobody scares you.
-Can't trust him.

95
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,949
Maggie, who is he?

96
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,132
He's my father.

97
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,334
-l thought your father was dead.
-He is.

98
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,569
To me, he is.

99
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,876
l want him gone, Brake.

100
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,475
Gone? He's your kin.
You just can't--

101
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:03,452
He ran off when l wasn't Dot's age.
Went lndian.

102
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,318
Turn your back,
he'll eat your horses and dogs.

103
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,488
He's being chased...

104
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,722
...or running from something,
l don't know what.

105
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,924
But he's bad, Brake. l swear.

106
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,503
l do not want him
near my children.

107
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:26,840
We're lndians, Lilly.
We're lndians.

108
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,721
Does he do that all night?

109
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,021
Oh, he's just getting started.

110
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,493
-You come here for the healing?
-ln a manner of speaking.

111
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,396
Thought you might be hungry.

112
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,797
-lt's rabbit stew.
-l can't eat rabbits.

113
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,106
l was bitten by a rattlesnake.

114
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,168
All right.

115
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,039
When there's company,
you sleep in there. ls that right?

116
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,973
That's right.

117
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,977
-You're not her husband?
-No, sir.

118
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,883
Not for lack of asking.

119
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,984
They your children?

120
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,818
No.

121
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,586
What happened to their father?

122
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,257
You don't know this?

123
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,300
l can't say what all happened
between you two...

124
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,564
...but you ain't welcome here.

125
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,845
But she's a good Christian.

126
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,541
She won't turn away any man
in need.

127
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,277
Tomorrow, she'll give you
what doctoring she can...

128
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,546
...then you're on your way.

129
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,162
There's places where a father
would kill a man...

130
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,824
...for doing what you're doing,
you know that, don't you?

131
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,293
lf you have something to say, say it.

132
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,298
Are you really a lndian?

133
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,335
Brake said you rode
with the Chiricahua.

134
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,409
That's right.

135
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:50,241
-So that means l'm part lndian, right?
-No.

136
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,146
Not at all.

137
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:17,097
You look stupid trying to work
in those fancy clothes, you know.

138
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,972
l am leaving here as soon as l can.

139
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,046
-l'm moving to the city.
-But Grandpa's visiting.

140
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,080
Did you see him?

141
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,911
He's a savage.

142
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,611
They're gut-eaters, you know.

143
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,523
l was born into the wrong family,
l swear to God l was.

144
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,504
-l appreciate this.
-Take off your shirt.

145
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,913
-Magdalena--
-Don't call me that. lt's not my name.

146
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,395
-Where's it hurt?
-Hurts when l breathe.

147
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,191
Mostly around here.

148
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,710
Yeah. Your muscles are torn
just under your ribs.

149
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,045
You need to put
a cottonwood plaster to it.

150
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,950
You'll live.

151
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,259
l never thought you'd turn out
to be a healer.

152
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,561
l remember you had
that yellow cat one time.

153
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,096
You cried because a badger
bit its tail off.

154
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,997
-Your mother came running--
-Don't remember. Not in front of me.

155
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,236
Because l remember my mother.

156
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:58,769
My mother died
scrubbing a man's floor.

157
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,275
And you killed her.

158
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,644
Didn't shoot her or stab her,
but what you did....

159
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,315
You broke her!

160
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,589
And l remember my brother too.

161
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,157
He lasted six years.

162
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,590
l bet you never even knew his name.

163
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,596
And l remember praying hard
every night that you'd come home.

164
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,630
On the day l put him
in the ground...

165
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,235
...l remember praying even harder
you were dead.

166
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:30,569
So you don't want to reminisce
with me, that l promise you.

167
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:34,103
l earned this money in large part...

168
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,774
...killing mountain lions for ranchers
like you. l want you to have it.

169
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,546
lf l were destitute
and drawing my last breath--

170
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,121
This is good money.
Take it for your children.

171
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,155
-Take it for your funeral.
-Magdalena.

172
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,961
l've done my duty as a Christian.
You get the hell off my ranch!

173
00:18:58,704 --> 00:18:59,966
l'd stop now.

174
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,938
Maggie asked you to leave.

175
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,382
l think it's time you did so, sir.

176
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,283
Right about now.

177
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,878
So long.

178
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,720
Nice making your acquaintance.

179
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,233
What's done is done, l guess.

180
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,543
l know you would have
done different.

181
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,883
l appreciate your regard, Brake.

182
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,652
l do.

183
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,416
Well, night, then.

184
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,455
Did they see you come in?

185
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,599
We can't make a sound.

186
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,257
Figure we can get them
all branded in a day?

187
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,589
-You want Dot to stay for company?
-Brake, you said l could go.

188
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,596
You promised.
Mama, you promised too.

189
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,395
Oh, l'm fine.
He won't be coming back.

190
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,704
This will help the cramping.

191
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,503
The calves are more important...

192
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,112
...than hearing your voice
come out of a machine.

193
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,080
Well, l guess you never had anything
but this. So why should l?

194
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,848
Come on, let's get going.

195
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,888
You sure look frilly
to be working cattle.

196
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,455
l'll keep an eye on them.

197
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:18,091
-Just be home before dark.
-All right.

198
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,999
All right.

199
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,494
Easy now.

200
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,691
That's right.

201
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,497
Dot?

202
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,243
Dot?

203
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,744
Darling?

204
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,584
Get! Get!

205
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,817
Dot?

206
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,419
No!

207
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,826
No!

208
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,508
Dot!

209
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,618
Oh, Lord. Darling.

210
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,321
Mama, l'm cold.

211
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:20,590
-l'm here, darling. Are you all right?
-l'm cold. l'm cold.

212
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:25,234
-Mama, l'm cold.
-Darling, where's Lilly?

213
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,432
-Emiliano.
-Yeah, l know.

214
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,633
Darling, where's Lilly?

215
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,540
Emiliano and me...

216
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,343
...we was in the arroyo.

217
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:44,352
We heard shots from where Brake
and Lilly was.

218
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,721
He told me, ''Stay down''...

219
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,883
...Emiliano did.

220
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,861
''Don't move. Stay down.''

221
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,523
He went to see...

222
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,769
...but he didn't come back.

223
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:03,704
l waited like he said,
but he didn't come back.

224
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:09,039
Brake was screaming, Mama.

225
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,615
He screamed so long
l wanted him to stop.

226
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,615
l know. l know it.

227
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,812
-l know it.
-Then he did.

228
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,117
Then someone rode away with Lilly.

229
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:27,123
l wanted him to stop!

230
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,794
l know it. l know it.

231
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,603
Darling, did you see who?

232
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,296
Who took your sister?

233
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,966
He wore a hood.

234
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,975
He was lndian.

235
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:28,455
l'm sorry for your loss, ma'am, but l'm
afraid you got the wrong fella in mind.

236
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:31,652
l've had the man you're describing
in jail since last night.

237
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,993
Sold himself a lion's hide
and got quite a drunk on.

238
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,498
Unacceptable drunk.

239
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,661
He did say he was staying out
by your place, though.

240
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,569
There's been raids like this
on people here lately...

241
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,641
...in Arizona and New Mexico.

242
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:50,179
Some Apaches jumped the reservation
at San Carlos middle of last month.

243
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:54,079
We've been getting communications
about them near every day.

244
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,818
To Fort Bowie.

245
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,752
From me.

246
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:06,094
Possible your hostiles
attacked local ranch.

247
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:10,064
Two dead, one girl missing.

248
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,862
Named....

249
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,904
Lilly Gilkeson.

250
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:17,169
Lilly Gilkeson.

251
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,333
Stop.

252
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,807
This takes just a moment.

253
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,710
The device is truly a miracle.

254
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:30,109
And now you'll hear your voice back
as clear as day.

255
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:34,384
-Ladies.
-My name's Louise Dewey.

256
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,924
<i>My name's Louise Dewey.</i>

257
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:47,163
To Sheriff Purdy...

258
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,498
...of Chloride.

259
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:53,007
Believe hostiles...

260
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:56,271
...headed northwest...

261
00:31:56,447 --> 00:32:00,543
...toward Colorado River.

262
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,583
Fourth Cavalry...

263
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:05,615
...will pursue...

264
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,487
...in due course.

265
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,694
Well, there you have it.

266
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:19,599
l'll send the undertaker out...

267
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,468
-...for the remains.
-You're not going after them?

268
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,108
Not under the present
circumstances, ma'am.

269
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,441
With the fair in town, l need
all the men l have right here.

270
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,140
lf you don't follow now,
their trail will get cold.

271
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,979
The Army is handling the situation.

272
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:38,452
They have Apache scouts.
Takes an Apache to catch an Apache.

273
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,387
lf someone doesn't go now,
my daughter may be dead.

274
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:47,555
Ma'am, l am elected to keep vigil
over this town of ours.

275
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:51,395
Just one or two men, sir,
that's all l'm asking.

276
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,471
Ma'am, l am sorry.

277
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,906
Seth, l need a word with you.

278
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,507
lt was the lndians did it.

279
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:07,479
Now, ladies, l will not authorize
fireworks until a water wagon is here.

280
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,020
Ma'am, that's the drunkard
from last night.

281
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,488
What would you like me
to do with him?

282
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,124
Let him go.

283
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,427
l don't care.

284
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,245
Mama?

285
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,318
Darling.

286
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,791
l want you to ride to the Handys'...

287
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,624
-No. No, l won't.
-...and stay there till l get back.

288
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:57,734
l won't stay behind. l'll follow you as
soon as you're gone, you know l will.

289
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,601
-Darling--
-l'm not-- You can't leave me, Ma.

290
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,971
l'm going with you, Mama,
please, l am.

291
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,874
-Now, you hear me, Dot--
-l'm not staying behind.

292
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,140
Wherever you put me,
l'm coming after you, Ma.

293
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,551
You know l'm not gonna stay put.

294
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,689
l swear to God, l won't stay put.

295
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,420
Hush, hush.

296
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,292
Hush, now. lt's all right.

297
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,061
Hush.

298
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,254
The Army's headed
in the wrong direction.

299
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,816
Seventeen horse tracks.

300
00:34:55,993 --> 00:35:01,431
Three shod, one outrider,
two cavalry horses.

301
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,600
Six horses were tied together...

302
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,002
...carrying light loads.
Probably young women, children.

303
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,205
And their captives...

304
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,636
...those are being led along...

305
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,043
...like packhorses.
They're headed south.

306
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,278
Not north.

307
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,286
Probably trying to make it
to the Mexican border.

308
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,958
The Apaches sell a lot of girls
over there.

309
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,324
Top dollar.

310
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,335
Can you track them?

311
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:49,043
You can track them. But if you catch
them, you'll wish you'd stayed home.

312
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,438
l don't wanna catch them.

313
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:56,785
Keep me on the trail till l get the Army
down to Fort Selden to catch them.

314
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,088
You wanted to give me money.

315
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,823
Do this instead.

316
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,620
Taking this child out there is foolish.

317
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,162
l know my daughter.

318
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:47,102
-Leave her behind, she'll just follow.
-No way to care for a girl.

319
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,939
What would you know about any of it?

320
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,967
l'll be just fine, thank you.

321
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,667
Come on, now.

322
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,294
Pretty moon, Anne.

323
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,402
Old Bob Hadley was supposed
to stop by tonight.

324
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,371
God.

325
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,379
Mama, l'm afraid in my room.

326
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:57,291
lt's just your fever giving you
bad dreams, honey.

327
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,929
You want Mama to sing you a song?

328
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,365
Your man didn't keep his rifle
very clean.

329
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:50,006
lf he wanted to marry you, though,
l guess that's something.

330
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,847
He's not all bad.

331
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,053
-Did you ever marry?
-Dot's father was my husband.

332
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,386
He built the ranch with me.

333
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:08,356
The notion of it was better
than the doing, l guess.

334
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,333
What about the other one's father?

335
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,066
Didn't get much of a look at him.

336
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,533
Maggie?

337
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,338
What you're doing,
you're doing for your own soul.

338
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:29,350
Because what you've done,
you can't undo.

339
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,557
You can all move now.

340
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,173
Sir...

341
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,581
...do you suppose it's safe for me
to be on my way now?

342
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:01,547
Mister, l don't suppose nothing.
You're theirs now.

343
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,986
They captured you.

344
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,518
Could you help me, please?

345
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:13,654
Go into the cave.
Bring picture-maker. Go!

346
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,233
Take them.

347
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,706
You're heartless.

348
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:38,283
l see you gentlemen are engaging
in a little frontier recreation out here.

349
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,753
No, these girls are going to market.

350
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,819
We ain't supposed to sully
the merchandise.

351
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,225
l can smell him from here.

352
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:04,745
l see you share a fondness for
the photographic arts like myself.

353
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:09,751
Where did you find
this squashed penis?

354
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:16,559
We captured him as a gift for you.

355
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:22,256
Sir, may l have the honor of posing
you with your captives, please?

356
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,627
He wants to take your picture.

357
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:29,230
Please, please.

358
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,681
That's perfect. Now...

359
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:43,084
-...very still.
-Help us. Help.

360
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,713
Please help us.

361
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:55,125
Look your best.

362
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,086
Lord, protect us.

363
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,689
Stay behind me.

364
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,764
-lndians.
-Yeah.

365
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:08,400
But not the way you're thinking.

366
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:14,573
ls there time enough to give
these men a proper Christian burial?

367
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,406
Dead's dead,
one way or the other.

368
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,314
l asked if there was time.

369
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,789
Yeah.

370
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,725
There's time.

371
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:41,828
Get in.

372
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:00,689
You must be the pride of your people.

373
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:03,259
And you of yours.

374
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:05,594
Prepare to dismount!

375
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:08,959
Dismount!

376
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:16,270
The two on the porch
have expired, lieutenant.

377
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,636
Ask him why he murdered those men.

378
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,903
l didn't murder anybody.
They were dead when l got here.

379
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,444
What are you doing in here?

380
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:27,775
My granddaughter was stolen two
days ago. l trailed her to this place.

381
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,849
What's her name?

382
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,023
You don't know your
granddaughter's name?

383
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,863
Well, her sister's name is Dot.

384
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,961
We found two horses with a bunch
of women's property in them.

385
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:49,133
Hang him.

386
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,750
-Other side!
-There he goes!

387
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,098
l didn't kill anyone!

388
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:22,201
-l said, l didn't kill anyone!
-Come out and show your hands!

389
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:26,035
-l am looking for my granddaughter!
-Then you tell me her damn name!

390
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,274
-l don't know her damn name!
-Lilly!

391
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,282
-Lilly Gilkeson.
-You know this lndian?

392
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,389
-He's no lndian.
-Damn well looks lndian to me.

393
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,186
No, he's a....

394
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:49,960
That's my father.

395
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:56,033
l've been hoping we'd find you, sir.
We need your help.

396
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:00,971
We tracked my daughter
south from Chloride.

397
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:03,305
They're heading toward Mexico.

398
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,514
Near as we can figure...

399
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:09,118
...they've hit six or seven homesteads
so far, including this one.

400
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,221
Army should've killed the heathens
when they had a chance.

401
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,880
They are Army, ma'am. Deserters.

402
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,886
Why, l thought they were Apache.

403
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,494
Apache scouts.

404
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,888
Formerly on Uncle Sam's payroll.

405
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,589
Like Happy Jim here.

406
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:28,227
-We use them to hunt other Apaches.
-The lndians were American soldiers?

407
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:33,270
Then a couple of months ago,
some of them turned...

408
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:37,436
...shot some white officers and jumped
the reservation in San Carlos.

409
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:41,573
The 4th Cavalry started all this
by hanging their chief.

410
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,183
Don't know what they were thinking.

411
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,448
What makes you think
they were thinking?

412
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:53,690
This whole territory's
gone topsy-turvy.

413
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:57,459
You got lndians running with whites,
whites running with lndians.

414
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,460
Get those prisoners moving!

415
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:03,902
Come on, squaw man.
Get on the way here.

416
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:10,641
Happy Jim.

417
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:18,552
You think because you're
wearing that coat

418
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:24,789
they won't put you on the prison train
to Florida with chains on your legs?

419
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:28,625
l don't know of Florida.

420
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:35,232
lt's a real swell shit-hole of a swamp.

421
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,297
You'll see.

422
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,671
White man, you don't look like
someone who gives good advice.

423
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:45,838
Break it up!

424
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:49,552
What's going on here?
l said, break it up.

425
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:54,517
-l found it first, lieutenant.
-Lying bastard!

426
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,721
Looks like God intended
you two to share.

427
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,995
Any man found looting...

428
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:06,533
...will have the value of their property
deducted from his pay.

429
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,170
They're enlisted men.

430
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,676
-Post two men over there.
-l'm going to camp down by the river.

431
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,610
lf l stay here long, l might misbehave.

432
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:23,912
--right over there.

433
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,487
Somebody might have to kill me.

434
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,359
Lieutenant?

435
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:40,760
l imagine you plan to ride first thing.

436
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:44,395
Would it be all right if my daughter
and l rode along with you?

437
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,772
Naturally, l'm quite concerned.

438
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:50,970
Ma'am, capturing those renegades
is the Army's highest priority.

439
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:53,742
-Yes, of course.
-Butcher a couple goats for supper!

440
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:57,409
-And l'm grateful.
-But that's the assignment of the 4th.

441
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,957
But the 4th is going
in the wrong direction.

442
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,683
l assure you, they'll be redirected
as soon as we reach Fort Stanton.

443
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:09,127
Stanton's three days away.
My daughter will be in Mexico by then.

444
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:12,234
l grieve for your situation, l truly do.

445
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:16,099
But my assignment is to return these
hostiles in my capture to Stanton...

446
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:19,606
...for their prompt
and immediate deportation.

447
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,680
-You like fish?
-Go water the horses.

448
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,475
-l watered them back at the--
-l'm not asking.

449
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,655
Don't make them too raw, please.

450
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,693
Very well, ma'am.

451
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:21,394
Lilly, she's...

452
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,966
...not the same as Dot.

453
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,337
She's not strong.

454
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:30,537
She gets hurt so easy.

455
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,308
Sage?

456
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,388
-What?
-For the fish.

457
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,585
l know l asked you
to get us to the Army--

458
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,754
l asked you if you wanted
some sage put on your fish.

459
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,639
Yeah. All right.

460
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:59,366
None for Dot.

461
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:07,174
We'll ride at first light in the morning.

462
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:13,213
lf we can catch up to them, l might
have enough money to buy her back.

463
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:21,060
lf they make it to Mexico...

464
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,625
...your child is lost.

465
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:36,604
Hey, that stuff will make you sick,
but l like it.

466
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:06,769
No, no, no, no. Whoa. That flash
behind her head bother you? lt's just--

467
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,376
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

468
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:13,545
There's no magic.
lt's an optical defect. A flaw.

469
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:14,945
A flaw. Flaw.

470
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:17,312
Wait, wait. Hey, wait.

471
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:20,614
Look at these.
Look at these. See?

472
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:24,515
l know where all the prettiest girls
live, from Arizona to Texas.

473
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:28,619
You pick the ones you want,
and l'll take you right to them. Look!

474
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:32,928
All the pretty girls, see? All of them!
l'll take you-- Look!

475
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,403
Take your bad luck to your grave.

476
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,808
What was that?

477
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,917
What did you just do?

478
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:53,650
l'll get it done.

479
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:57,958
Who of you can skin a deer?

480
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:03,494
Hey! Who of you can skin a deer?

481
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:07,600
Me. l can.

482
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:16,307
All right. Gotta gut her.

483
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,841
l can't see.

484
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:57,686
What is happening to me?

485
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:02,853
Somebody tell me.
What is happening?

486
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:07,292
l can't see. l can't see. Please!

487
00:56:56,846 --> 00:57:00,475
Where's clubfoot going? l thought we
was dropping back down into Mexico.

488
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:05,644
Seven's an unlucky number for him.
He wants eight girls. We go now.

489
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:08,047
Shit!

490
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:12,058
Here.

491
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,160
Fill the packs with meat.

492
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,765
l gotta take Sally.
No, l gotta take my little girl.

493
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:25,738
No! She just needs water.
She's fine.

494
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,900
Shut up. She's dead now, mama.

495
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,374
-She's my baby.
-Shut up.

496
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,241
No!

497
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,814
No! No! No!

498
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:42,984
No, no, no, no.

499
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,253
No!

500
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,627
Get up!

501
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,288
Get up!

502
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,792
Get up!

503
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,838
Trying to make a fool of me.

504
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,369
lt's gonna be all right.

505
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:22,663
l think my feet grew two sizes today.

506
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,863
Try these.

507
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:37,909
-They're beautiful.
-They were my wife's.

508
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,077
My grandmother?

509
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:47,514
No.

510
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,130
Mama!

511
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,107
-Mama!
-Dot?

512
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:44,543
You all right?

513
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:47,114
You get bit?
Did those snakes bite you?

514
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:48,648
No.

515
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,983
Mama, a dead man's in there.

516
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,520
Don't worry about that child.

517
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,087
Go on now.

518
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,630
Mama, look at his eyes.

519
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,873
-What happened to him?
-He lost control of his wagon.

520
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:13,842
Maybe he had a heart seizure.

521
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,138
He didn't have a heart seizure.
His heart's in that hole.

522
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,529
What's behind her head?

523
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:49,842
-Some people would think it's a sign.
-A good sign or bad sign?

524
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:52,379
lt wasn't a very good sign for him.
Come here.

525
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:58,246
-What are you doing?
-These are for protection.

526
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:01,083
The man who did this is a <i>brujo</i>.

527
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:03,691
-A what?
-lt's a witch.

528
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,259
You need to wear one too.

529
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:08,761
You can believe in your witchcraft
and your impiety all you want.

530
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:11,325
l believe in what l've seen, girl.

531
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,698
Snakes belong on the ground.
This one hangs them in the air.

532
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:18,864
A man's heart holds his spirit. This
one digs it out and throws it in the dirt.

533
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,270
Don't you start this.

534
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,435
l know a <i>brujo</i> who'd put an arrow
in you a mile away.

535
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:27,174
l know a <i>brujo</i> who laid his hand
on a child one time. One time.

536
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,547
The child cramped up, fell down
and spit up bees till she died.

537
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,451
-You stop this. You're scaring her.
-She needs to be scared. So do you.

538
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:37,684
Mama, please. Please.

539
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:47,698
Just on her.

540
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:28,134
We gotta get through that canyon
before the storm hits.

541
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,074
You go on and l'll follow.

542
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,579
Give me some of the medical stuff
they stole, the laudanum.

543
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,691
You like that stuff.

544
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:48,254
You know, l drink enough
of this stuff, l swear...

545
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,229
-...you start to look good to me.
-Hey.

546
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:55,437
They give this to my grandma
when she was fixing to croak.

547
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:34,070
Mama!

548
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,237
Mama!

549
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,075
l'll get her!

550
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,076
Get those horses to higher ground!

551
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:44,910
l've got her!

552
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,597
Dot, you hold on to me!

553
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,197
My foot's caught!

554
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:48,944
Hold your breath! Right now!

555
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,500
Gotta piss.

556
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,461
Sit up.

557
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:21,643
l can get us out of here.

558
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,573
-Do you hear that?
-You mustn't speak.

559
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,978
My baby's calling me.

560
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:31,077
No. l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.

561
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:34,021
Your baby's passed on.

562
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:37,984
No. That's just how she sleeps.

563
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:41,561
There's nothing you can do,
so please just--

564
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:51,605
There, there. My baby.

565
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:06,112
Here. Watch out while l get
the horses.

566
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:14,558
Hey. Just going to get
those berries l promised you.

567
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,357
Don't wander off.

568
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:27,366
Lord, forgive me.

569
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:51,230
Stop squirming.

570
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:56,470
-Goddamn you!
-Give her to me.

571
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:58,106
-Get up!
-No!

572
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:00,265
-l got her.
-No!

573
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:02,809
-Tie her legs!
-Shut up!

574
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:04,505
Shut up!

575
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,807
Why?

576
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:11,812
Now we're gonna be back to seven,
and seven's an unlucky number.

577
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:15,520
Whore! Stop!

578
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:33,240
Thank you.

579
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:36,869
Crawl.

580
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,606
You're better than them,
but you're not better than me.

581
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,298
Can she have the moccasins now?

582
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,336
Yeah.

583
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,379
Can l just--?

584
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,422
l'm glad you were here.

585
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,865
l was bitten by a rattlesnake.

586
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,499
What?

587
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:42,138
A good shaman gave me
two amulets.

588
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,706
Told me not to eat
rabbit meat for a year...

589
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:51,044
...to say my prayers every morning...

590
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,888
...take care of my family,
and l might get well.

591
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:01,385
You're telling me the only
reason you came back...

592
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:04,431
...was because you were
following the say-so of some...

593
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,568
...medicine man. ls that right?

594
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:11,306
Yes. Absolutely. A rattlesnake
can make your soul...

595
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:16,308
...very sick.

596
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:21,274
That's likely not what
you want to hear.

597
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,714
But it is the truth.

598
01:10:56,085 --> 01:11:03,321
We have eight girls. Now, we can go.
