1
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,360
Handful of hunters caught
buffalo and deer

2
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,160
Back when the west was young
At the last frontier

3
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,000
Snake bites, Indian fights
plagued the pioneer

4
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,320
The pioneer

5
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,920
We're all at the last frontier

6
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,240
The last frontier

7
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,520
Back when the law was
the law of the open spaces

8
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,160
The folks out there were fair and square

9
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,440
They paid every debt
by the sweat of their honest faces

10
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,200
Snow, heat, little meat
famine almost near

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,440
And still they struggled on
hiding every tear

12
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,120
Stout hearts played their parts
in that bygone year

13
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,880
Back there at the last frontier

14
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,640
The last frontier

15
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,200
Did you ever see so many smiling faces?

16
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,160
I wonder what's bothering them?
Ask them, Mungo.

17
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,720
Let them talk first.

18
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,520
I'm getting hungry. Let's make camp here.

19
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,560
I guess this is as good a place as any.

20
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,360
- You got any salt, Jed?
- I ate the last speck day before yesterday.

21
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,640
Mungo?

22
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,920
I sure miss a sprinkle of salt on me meat.

23
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,440
Right now I'd give a whole silver dollar...

24
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,560
for just enough to sting
the edge of me tongue.

25
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,960
You're a mighty free spender
with silver dollars you ain't got, Gus?

26
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,920
I'm a big spender, I am.
You just wait till we trade in these skins...

27
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,720
and I'll show you how fast
I can shed my share.

28
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,800
What you gonna do
with your share, Mungo?

29
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,960
Whiskey.

30
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,000
Dollars?

31
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,240
Right now that appeals to me.

32
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,680
Don't get up, just keep eating.

33
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,080
He wants our rifles.

34
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,760
Give them to him.

35
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,760
He wants more.

36
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,040
- Not one more thing.
- Shut up, Jed.

37
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,400
- Give him the horses.
- Not the horses, Gus.

38
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,560
There's a year's work tied up in those packs.
A year of freezing, starving, and slaving.

39
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,360
I know. I've got more than a year's work
tied up in me...

40
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,200
and I've no mind to lose it
for some tired horses and a pack of furs.

41
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Give them the horses, Mungo.

42
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,240
Red Cloud says we're no longer welcome.

43
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,760
We're not to shoot, fish,
or set traps in the forest anymore.

44
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
We must go back beyond the river.

45
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,760
- Lf we return, we die.
- Why?

46
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,280
We ain't never done him any harm.
There's plenty here for all of us.

47
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,840
- It's the bluecoats.
- Soldiers.

48
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,360
- When did they come?
- In the spring.

49
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,000
- They chop down many trees. Build fort.
- Where?

50
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,400
Paha Saba.

51
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,440
Red Cloud says they all die
before snow falls...

52
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,360
and so will any white man
who sets foot in these woods.

53
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,240
We never fished
nor killed any more than we could eat.

54
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,520
And we're no bluecoats.
Why is he taking it out on us?

55
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,800
- Civilisation.
- Civilisation?

56
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,320
Civilisation is creeping up on us, lads.

57
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,920
The bluecoats ain't satisfied...

58
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,240
with gobbling up all the land
east of Mississippi.

59
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,680
They won't stop till they've pushed us over
the Rockies and into the Pacific Ocean.

60
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,160
It's a drowning fate awaits us all.

61
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,640
These are calamitous times
we're living in, Jed.

62
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,000
Calamitous times.

63
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,440
They ain't pushing me
off the face of this earth.

64
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,200
I'm going down to that fort...

65
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,920
and collect every single thing
that Red Cloud took from us.

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,160
Are you?

67
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,760
Me big bull buffalo.

68
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,320
You never tangled with men
like these before, Jed.

69
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,960
You don't know them like I do.
They talk with forked tongues.

70
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,680
Once you set foot inside that fort...

71
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,640
they'll snare you.

72
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,640
And how'll they snare me?

73
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,400
They got wondrous ways. No.

74
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,840
We'll go north to Canada.

75
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,280
We'll get a stake from the Bay Company.
Then we'll strike out for fresh country.

76
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,080
You can go north, Gus.

77
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,080
But them bluecoats owe us for them skins
and I'm collecting it.

78
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,720
- Lf you want to wait for me here, you wait.
- No, I'd better go with you.

79
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,840
- Somebody's got to do the thinking.
- All right.

80
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,400
You do the thinking,
but I'm doing the talking.

81
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,880
Halt!

82
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,120
Halt, or I'll fire!

83
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,240
See, what did I tell you.
Right away they want to shoot us.

84
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,080
- We go to Canada.
- Not until we get paid.

85
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,360
It's all right, sentry. They're unarmed.

86
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,160
Come ahead.

87
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,040
- Who runs this place, mister?
- I do.

88
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,400
You owe us for five horses,
three rifles and a year's trapping.

89
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,240
- What are you gonna do about it?
- What are you talking about?

90
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,680
What me friend means to say is...

91
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,960
that on account of your building this fort,
stirring up bad feelings...

92
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,960
we was relieved of them things
by Red Cloud.

93
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,440
- You had a run in with Red Cloud?
- Aye.

94
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,320
- How'd you get away?
- We never bothered Red Cloud.

95
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,280
I guess he don't think of us as white men.

96
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,480
I'd like to make good your loss
by giving you men jobs.

97
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,880
The Army needs scouts.

98
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
We're too busy.
We've got too many places to go.

99
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,680
Wait a minute, Gus.

100
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,560
We ain't got no place to go.

101
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,040
- What'll you pay us?
- $25 a month per man.

102
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,200
Free room and board, guns,
all the ammunition you can use...

103
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,680
and you can keep whatever skins you hunt.

104
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,920
- You're trying to trap us, mister?
- Yes, I am.

105
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,480
We lost our commanding officer and scout
since we started building this fort...

106
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,440
so we're a little short-handed.
The Army needs men.

107
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,920
We get to wear those blue coats?

108
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,440
Only soldiers wear uniforms.

109
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,280
No bluecoat, no scouting.

110
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,360
I can't let you enlist.
It wouldn't be right for you.

111
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,160
Why not?

112
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,680
You men are trappers.
You're used to a lot of freedom.

113
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,560
There are certain restrictions
a soldier serves under.

114
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,680
It'd be a tough life for you.

115
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
- You done your thinking?
- Canada.

116
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,800
I'll promise you this.

117
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,560
The moment you're ready
to become a soldier, I'll make you one.

118
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,280
You have my word on that.

119
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,800
I like him.

120
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,200
His face don't lie to me.

121
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,560
How about you, Mungo?

122
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,400
You got whiskey?

123
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,640
You can buy anything
inside the fort you want.

124
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,040
- I'll see that you get paid in advance.
- I like him, too.

125
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,600
It's leading us into a trap, you are.

126
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,720
Come on inside.

127
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,560
Parade, attention!

128
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,640
Present arms!

129
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Order arms!

130
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,120
- Dismissed!
- Dismissed.

131
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,160
That's me boy.

132
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,320
Where are you going, lad?

133
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,440
- Whiskey!
- Whiskey!

134
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,800
Mungo, whiskey!

135
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,560
Okay.

136
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,000
Halt.

137
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,360
Get out.

138
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,160
Do you have any whiskey?

139
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,120
Get out or I'll call the guard.

140
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,200
He can't hear you.

141
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,360
- Who's he?
- That's my husband, Col. Marston.

142
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,120
Say.

143
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,720
I guess you have to dress
in a fancy uniform like this...

144
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,280
to have a woman like you.

145
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,000
If you don't leave,
you'll be severely punished, Mr. Cooper.

146
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,360
Mr. Cooper?

147
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,040
- You know me?
- I saw you enter the fort.

148
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,040
Capt. Riordan tells me
he hired you as a scout...

149
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,960
to protect us.

150
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,720
You don't have to worry
about anything, lady.

151
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,320
I'll protect you...

152
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,520
and your husband, too.

153
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,080
- You sure you ain't got any whiskey?
- Positive.

154
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,600
You must have some whiskey 'cause
the Colonel looks like a drinking man.

155
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,040
You've had too much to drink already.
Will you kindly return to your quarters?

156
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,280
You know, I'm really going to be glad
to meet the Colonel.

157
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,960
He dresses so fancy.

158
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,240
My husband isn't here, he's at Fort Medford.

159
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,400
He's at Fort Medford
on the other side of the forest?

160
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,120
I'm sorry to tell you, lady...

161
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,760
but you're a widow woman.

162
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,200
'Cause Red Cloud ain't gonna
let nobody build a fort in his back yard.

163
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,720
Please go.

164
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,160
What kind of woman are you?

165
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,880
Don't you cry when you hear
that your man's dead?

166
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,640
I like strong women.

167
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,400
Take your hands off me.
You're a drunken, filthy animal.

168
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,440
I'm not an animal.

169
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,440
And I wouldn't drink
your whiskey if you had any.

170
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,640
And I feel sorry for your husband.

171
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,160
Bucko.

172
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,120
What's the matter? Somebody shove you?

173
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,600
If I was an Indian,
you'd be a dead soldier, Luke.

174
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,320
- Where'd you come from?
- Where you should have been looking.

175
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,160
I haven't got eyes in the back of my head.

176
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,840
- You've got ears, haven't you?
- Yes.

177
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,360
- You'd better start using them.
- Yes.

178
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,760
If you don't, them Indians will be
wearing that bluecoat.

179
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,160
Yes, Jed.

180
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,240
How do you like your fish, Captain?

181
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,520
Cooper, if you were in uniform,
I'd lock you up.

182
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,720
Yes, Captain.

183
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,880
How do you like your fish?

184
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,920
- You left the fort without permission. Why?
- It's the best time of the year for trout.

185
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,720
Look, you just can't go wandering off
anytime you feel like it.

186
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,320
- What am I gonna do with you?
- Why don't you make me a soldier?

187
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,080
- No.
- Why not?

188
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,120
Because a soldier does more
than wear a blue uniform.

189
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,760
You mean, I'm not good enough for it.

190
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,600
Captain, I can leave. I don't have to stay
anywhere where I'm not wanted.

191
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,680
I want you to stay, Jed.
I like you. You're my friend.

192
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,040
What's wrong with me, Captain?

193
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,240
If you're my friend, tell me.

194
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,160
- You're just not civilised.
- What is this "civilised"?

195
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,200
I guess it's the opposite of being a savage.

196
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,720
You know,
even I have a hard time understanding you.

197
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,120
I understand you.

198
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,760
It's deeper than that, Jed.
You have to belong.

199
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,360
- Belong to what?
- To other people.

200
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,560
Me, Gus and Mungo. We've lived like that.

201
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,640
Ain't we people?

202
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,840
You gotta have a family. A wife, children.

203
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,360
Do you?

204
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,040
- I hope to, if I ever get out of here.
- That's what I'm gonna do, Captain.

205
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,800
Find me a woman, make some children,
get married and become civilised.

206
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,320
I won't go fool around
with these fish anymore until I tell you first.

207
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,680
I guess that's the first step, Jed.

208
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,160
Anything from Fort Medford?

209
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,560
Not yet, Phil. We've been trying
to get through all evening.

210
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,640
Would you like a fish?

211
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,800
No, thank you.

212
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,000
I want to thank you for not telling
the Captain about me getting drunk.

213
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,520
He might've been disappointed.

214
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,640
As soon as the snow falls...

215
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,480
I'm gonna go up in the mountains
and get you a bear skin.

216
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,960
- It will keep you warm for the winter.
- That isn't necessary.

217
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,680
How else am I gonna make friends with you?

218
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,960
Is that really important?

219
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,120
Yes.

220
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,880
Sorry, Mrs. Marston.
We just can't get through.

221
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
I could've told you that. I saw the cut wires.

222
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
We'll know more
when Gus gets back with Mungo.

223
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,520
Gus ain't here?

224
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,440
- Where'd you send him?
- Fort Medford.

225
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,240
You know that Medford's done for
and you sent Gus and Mungo anyway?

226
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,080
Why?

227
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,360
- I wanna know why, Captain.
- Because they are scouts paid by the Army.

228
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,040
It's their job and their duty.

229
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,840
That's something you wouldn't understand.
Gus and Mungo do.

230
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,840
I might not understand you, Captain,
but I'm going after them.

231
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,680
I better find them healthy.

232
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,200
If I find your Colonel kicking around,
I'll bring him back, too.

233
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,920
What kept you?

234
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,880
It's all right, lads.

235
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,240
It's just a friend of mine
come to pay his respects.

236
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,520
- Where'd you pick up our trail?
- Fort Medford.

237
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,800
- You kind of ran into some trouble there?
- Aye.

238
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,400
- Red Cloud and his Tetons.
- Yeah, they kept coming for two days.

239
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,880
We couldn't hold so we shot our way out...

240
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,360
with what was left of us.

241
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,720
- What's the matter here?
- I got a rifle ball about two inches in.

242
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,480
- It's beginning to kick up a mite.
- It's probably trying to get out.

243
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,520
Where'd you come from?

244
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,480
Fort Shallan.

245
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,640
Stand up when I'm talking to you.

246
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,360
Col. Marston.

247
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,440
Sir, this is scout Jed Cooper.
He'll see us safe to Shallan.

248
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,560
Come here.

249
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,320
Where are the reinforcements from Shallan?
I requested 100 men.

250
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,440
I'm all there is, Colonel.

251
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,560
- Who sent you?
- Capt. Riordan.

252
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,560
You go back and tell this Capt. Riordan
I want 100 men.

253
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,440
- We'll wait right here until they come.
- You can't stay here, Colonel.

254
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,440
As soon as Red Cloud buries his dead,
he'll be hot on your trail again.

255
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,840
With 100 men...

256
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,000
I'll meet Red Cloud in his own front yard
and crush him.

257
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,280
- We're gonna retake Fort Medford.
- It's burnt down.

258
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,040
We'll rebuild it.

259
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
You have your orders, Cooper.

260
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Capt. Riordan won't sent a single man
out of Shallan unless I tell him to.

261
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,080
And I ain't telling him.

262
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,880
Who's the Commander at Shallan?
You or the Captain?

263
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,840
The Captain.

264
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,920
But he's a smart man.

265
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,160
Beg pardon, sir, let me talk to him alone.
I'll knock some respect into him.

266
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,880
Never mind, Decker.

267
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,520
I'll give you a choice.

268
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,920
Carry out my order
or I'll have you shot right here and now.

269
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,320
I gave you my answer.

270
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,280
If you don't move out now,
you'll never get to Fort Shallan.

271
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,080
- Corporal, how are the wounded?
- Some need a doctor bad, sir.

272
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,120
There's a doctor at Shallan.

273
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,880
Decker, improvise litters for the wounded.
We're moving out.

274
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,160
If it wasn't for you and Mungo,
I'd walk right out of here.

275
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,120
Red Cloud would really love
that Colonel's uniform.

276
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,920
Civilisation is creeping up on us, lads.

277
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,200
Turn out the guard! Armed party!

278
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,680
Present arms!

279
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,720
Order arms!

280
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,280
Glad you got through, Frank.

281
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,320
- Capt. Clarke, isn't it?
- That's right, Colonel.

282
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,440
- I'd better see to your wounded.
- Get those men to the hospital.

283
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,480
- Capt. Glenn Riordan, sir.
- At ease, Captain.

284
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,520
I'm glad to see you made it, sir.

285
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,440
Must have been pretty rough.

286
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,960
It was.

287
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,920
Hello, Frank.

288
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,960
Corinna.

289
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,440
I'll see you to your quarters, sir.

290
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,760
I brought the Colonel back for you.

291
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,640
Yes, I'm grateful, Mr. Cooper.

292
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,320
- See that he gets rubbed down well, Decker.
- Yes, sir.

293
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,560
You know, Jed, I may not be
as pretty as the Colonel's wife...

294
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,440
but you carry me gently
and I'll give you the kiss she didn't.

295
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,680
- I'll drop you, bucko!
- No, Jed, you'll kill me surely!

296
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,600
Why don't you get some rest, Frank?

297
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,400
Rest?

298
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,360
Who can sleep?

299
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,200
How did I ever get out here?

300
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,800
You could have stayed in Washington.

301
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,480
Behind a desk?

302
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,640
Shoving a pencil?

303
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,520
Why did you stay in the service, then?

304
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,440
What else do I know?

305
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,360
Are you any happier being a soldier?

306
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,120
You're a woman.

307
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,840
You don't know victory.

308
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,200
It has a taste.

309
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,760
So does defeat. I've shared that with you.

310
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,120
Come on in, Frank.

311
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,720
Why did you come out here with me?

312
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,080
I'm your wife.

313
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,080
- I don't want you to feel sorry for me.
- What do you want from me, Frank?

314
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,560
I want respect.

315
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,760
I want you to respect me.

316
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,440
How can you in this miserable place?

317
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,240
Look at the men who were
at West Point with me. Look where they are.

318
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,080
I'll be up there with them.

319
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,560
- I'll make you proud of me, Corinna.
- I don't care what you are.

320
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
I married a man, not a uniform.

321
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,080
And I deceived you.

322
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,360
I'm not a man without this.

323
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,320
Don't you ever sleep, Cooper?

324
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,760
- What are you doing up, Captain?
- Watching you.

325
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,800
Are you afraid I might do something wrong?

326
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,160
You wouldn't do anything wrong, Cooper.

327
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,320
Good night.

328
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,160
I won't do anything
you wouldn't enjoy, Captain.

329
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,080
Good night.

330
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,680
Mungo.

331
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,240
Report.

332
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,720
All present and accounted for, sir.

333
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,560
Present arms!

334
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,440
Order arms!

335
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,600
Good morning, Colonel.

336
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,320
- How many men, Captain?
- 140. Raw recruits.

337
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,000
Half of them shoot each other
at target practise...

338
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,480
the other half catch cold
running out in their drawers at reveille.

339
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,120
They can be trained.

340
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,680
They are only odds and ends
they could spare from the war back east.

341
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,680
I guess most of us here are misfits.
Forgotten misfits.

342
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,400
Shunted out here
because the department wants to forget us.

343
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,680
But not all of us are cowards, Clarke.

344
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,160
If the definition of a coward...

345
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,560
is a man who is sickened
by killing and blood...

346
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,600
- I qualify.
- In every sense.

347
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,280
Capt. Clarke,
check on your men in the hospital.

348
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,960
Find out how many can return to duty
and when.

349
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,000
Before I was forced
to abandon Fort Medford...

350
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,160
I telegraphed for reinforcements.

351
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,400
They never came.

352
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,480
I believe it'd be better to discuss this
in my quarters, sir. Or yours.

353
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,240
I have nothing to hide, Captain.

354
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,840
Have you?

355
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,520
Sending out 100 men from this fort
would have left us practically helpless, sir.

356
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,320
So you took it upon yourself
to disregard my request.

357
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,840
Shallan is a key fort, sir.
If Red Cloud takes it...

358
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,640
there's nothing between him
and Fort Laramie.

359
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,560
He's very tricky, sir. And clever.

360
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,320
The man's a savage, Riordan. Not Napoleon.

361
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,480
You're afraid of an ignorant savage?

362
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,000
The Colonel had a taste
of this ignorant savage at Medford.

363
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,560
Yes, I did.

364
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,920
But I'm going back there, Captain.

365
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,120
We're all going back there.

366
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,240
I'll hang Red Cloud
and enough of his men...

367
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,160
to put the fear of the Army
into every Indian in this country.

368
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,360
Go back?

369
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,320
- That's what I said.
- You can't, without more men.

370
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,000
And we're not going
to get any more while the Civil War is on.

371
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,760
There are enough men here.

372
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,720
We were sent out here
to build this fort and to hold it.

373
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,560
As I told you before,
these men aren't trained.

374
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,760
- Sgt. Decker!
- Sir!

375
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,960
I want all training procedure
doubled immediately.

376
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,520
- Make soldiers out of them.
- Yes, sir.

377
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,680
- This is my command, sir.
- It was.

378
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,440
- Do you have orders relieving me?
- I don't need them.

379
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,120
I'm senior officer in the territory.
You're subject to my orders.

380
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,560
You can accept that,
or place yourself under arrest.

381
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,440
Yes, sir.

382
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,240
- Decker, send Cooper to my quarters.
- Yes, sir.

383
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,800
Hi, Captain.

384
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,960
- Col. Marston wants to see you in his office.
- I heard him.

385
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,600
The Colonel does not like
to be kept waiting.

386
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,280
I'm eating breakfast.

387
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,480
Cooper, someday
I'm gonna take you to pieces.

388
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,200
Do you have anything to do right now?

389
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,480
Just let me know
when you've finished your breakfast.

390
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,480
- I'm finished. Come on, Mungo.
- Not him.

391
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,840
- He goes where I go.
- He's an Indian.

392
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,280
Say.

393
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,000
You are an Indian.

394
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,920
How about that?

395
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,000
You better not go, Mungo.
You might get in trouble.

396
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,440
Do they miss me at home?

397
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,480
Do they miss me?

398
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,360
'Twould be an assurance most dear

399
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,200
To know that this moment some loved one

400
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,080
Were saying

401
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,440
I wish he were here

402
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,840
To feel that the group

403
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,600
At the fireside

404
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,480
Were thinking of me

405
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,760
As I roam

406
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,200
Oh, yes

407
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,040
'Twould be joy beyond measure

408
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,240
No good.

409
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,720
No, Mungo. Very good.

410
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,440
To know that they missed me at home

411
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,440
To know that they missed me

412
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,600
At home

413
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,120
They tied the arrows. I saw them.

414
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,440
I sent you out to scout Red Cloud.

415
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,080
Why didn't you have Cooper
report directly to me?

416
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,120
I wanted to talk to Gus first.

417
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,520
Cooper is a civilian scout.
You know procedure.

418
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,040
I'm sorry, sir.

419
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,320
Your report, Cooper.

420
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,160
Red Cloud and the men
are camped at the foot of the canyon.

421
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,080
They're having a meeting
with the Assiniboin chief.

422
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,440
- Looks like they're gonna join forces.
- How long will that take them?

423
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,640
- About a week.
- They gotta make it by then, sir.

424
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,400
- Why?
- Red Cloud's gotta beat the snow.

425
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,400
Otherwise he'll have to hold off till spring.

426
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,920
By that time maybe
the war back east will be over.

427
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,840
Red Cloud knows
that means more men here, more guns.

428
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,080
He's got to strike soon
while he's got the chance.

429
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,680
How soon will it snow?

430
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,080
Like Gus said, the snow's overdue.

431
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,760
- Where you going, Cooper?
- To get some coffee.

432
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,240
- Is it that urgent?
- It is to me.

433
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,960
When I first came here...

434
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,760
Capt. Riordan assured me
that Fort Shallan was an important post.

435
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,200
- How are you, soldier?
- Fine, sir.

436
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,800
Has anything happened
to change your mind, Captain?

437
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,880
My last orders from Fort Laramie
were to hold, sir.

438
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,800
Since communication's been cut off...

439
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,400
I have no way of knowing
what other orders there may be.

440
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,160
There are orders, Captain.

441
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,800
Mine.

442
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,800
I lost Medford because my orders
were to stay inside the fort and hold.

443
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,720
Holding actions do not win battles.

444
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,440
I was sent out here to build a fort.
Not attack Red Cloud.

445
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,560
How did Red Cloud become so powerful?

446
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,080
Because no one had the courage
to move out against him.

447
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,200
With what?

448
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,240
Men who had to be shown
which end of a rifle to point?

449
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,800
It was up to you to make soldiers of them.

450
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,360
Which is just exactly
what they are going to become.

451
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,920
Don't attack yet. We still have
a good chance of holding off Red Cloud...

452
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,400
until it does snow.

453
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,000
And if the Assiniboins join Red Cloud first,
they'll attack.

454
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,160
I don't intend to let them join forces.

455
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,600
- You can't do it, Frank. It's suicide.
- I'll be leading the men.

456
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,640
I've no intention of committing suicide.

457
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,280
Stop him, Glenn. You know it's wrong.

458
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,640
Capt. Clarke, I believe
you're forgetting yourself.

459
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,360
Col. Marston, here,
is in command of this fort.

460
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,680
Thank you, Captain.

461
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,000
You were assigned here as a doctor.
Not a military strategist.

462
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,120
Please return to your patients
where maybe you'll do a little good.

463
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Ask him what happened at Shiloh.

464
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,280
Ask him. And if he won't tell you, I will.

465
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,120
- How are you feeling?
- I'll be all right, sir.

466
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,600
- Think you'll be strong enough to march?
- I'll try, sir.

467
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,360
I'll tell you what happened at Shiloh.

468
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,520
I lost 1,500 men in a single encounter.

469
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,360
We were cut to ribbons by enemy artillery.

470
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,120
By the time the report
got back to Washington...

471
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,560
they were calling me the Butcher of Shiloh.

472
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,560
Yes, they called me the Butcher of Shiloh.

473
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,520
But reports are cold facts on paper.

474
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,680
I took a calculated risk.
I dared where cautious men stood still.

475
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,920
But victory is not given to the cautious.

476
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,680
That's why the war back east
still drags on after four years.

477
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,200
Because our men in command
have no daring.

478
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,880
If I had taken the enemy artillery position,
it would have turned the tide.

479
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,680
But unfortunately the War Department
does not reward courage.

480
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,760
Just results.

481
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,280
But if I had to decide Shiloh again...

482
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,440
I'd do exactly what I did.

483
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,080
Go ahead. Go after him if you want to.

484
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,600
Go on.

485
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,080
I gotta get you out of here.

486
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,640
I can take you up in the mountains
where you'll be safe.

487
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,840
- I don't want to leave.
- But you've got to.

488
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,080
The Colonel's gonna get himself
and everybody in this fort killed.

489
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,560
- Why do you want to save me?
- Because I want you for my woman.

490
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,440
I don't have to ask you.
I could take you if I wanted to.

491
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,160
- You're a savage.
- Are you crazy like he is?

492
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,000
- Do you wanna die, too?
- No, I wanna live.

493
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,520
I'll take good care of you.

494
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,920
I know these mountains
like I know the fingers on my hand.

495
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,440
There are other women at the fort.

496
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,160
- But they're not mine.
- I'm not your woman!

497
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,560
You think you're too good for me? You ain't.

498
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,320
You're another scalp for Red Cloud
to hang up in his tent.

499
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,320
I don't want to be saved by you, Mr. Cooper,
or any other man.

500
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,960
I've been saved enough.

501
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,400
First by Col. Marston who married me
to keep me from being a spinster.

502
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,960
And now, you offer me the choice of dying
or becoming your squaw.

503
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,040
- You don't understand.
- What is there left to understand?

504
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,440
- You're no different from him.
- I am.

505
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,800
How?

506
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,760
I care for you.

507
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,360
I need you.

508
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,960
How can I help you?

509
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,640
I can't even help myself.

510
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,240
I know what I am.

511
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,720
I know when I'm wrong.

512
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,240
You could make it right.

513
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,480
Cease fire.

514
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,960
Hold your fire!

515
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,320
Decker, turn out the guard,
double the sentries.

516
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,600
Bugler, call to arms...

517
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,520
Oh, that ain't no use, Colonel.

518
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,360
That was one brave come in close enough
to get himself a coup.

519
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,320
He's right, sir. It's happened before.

520
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,200
Some young brave wanted
to make a name for himself.

521
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,400
They don't have much respect for you,
do they?

522
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,160
You may be right, sir.

523
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,920
But I have an awful lot of respect for them.

524
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,000
Mr. Benton, get a burial detail.

525
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,640
You keep messing around
with her and you'll wind up hanging.

526
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,520
We weren't messing around.

527
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,960
No? What was you doing?
Showing her your buffalo hides?

528
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,200
She's going to be my woman.

529
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,760
The Colonel's lady
is gonna be your woman?

530
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,400
That's right.

531
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,440
Don't laugh, Gus.

532
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,520
No. No, maybe it ain't so funny.

533
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,760
Maybe, it's kind of sad.

534
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,040
I want you to forget her.

535
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,680
I want you to get her out of your mind.

536
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,320
- Forget her. Do you hear me? Forget her.
- Leave me alone, Gus.

537
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,840
I'm mighty disappointed in you, Jed boy.

538
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,640
You make me feel
all the years I spent with you was wasted.

539
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,640
Jed.

540
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,720
I'd have died for you more than once
as you would for me.

541
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,520
I feel for you
like you was me own flesh and blood, lad.

542
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,480
Do you believe that?

543
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,040
Do you believe it?

544
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,360
- I don't know what to believe.
- I think I got a right to talk.

545
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,880
And I'm asking you to stay away from her.

546
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,000
She can hurt you, Jed.

547
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,560
She can break you into pieces
without making you bleed.

548
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,040
She ain't no squaw woman.

549
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,720
She can't sleep in a tree
or hide out in a cave.

550
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,200
She's a fancy lady
and she needs a fancy gent.

551
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,160
You can't even read or write.

552
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,360
And whose fault is that?

553
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,600
It's mine, I should have
taught you them things when you was little.

554
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,640
Only I couldn't,
'cause I never learnt them myself.

555
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,680
I guess you and me...

556
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,680
are just about two of
the most ignorant men alive.

557
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,560
Sometimes, she looks at me
like I was a bear.

558
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,280
There's some comfort in being a bear
when you live in bear country.

559
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,480
But I don't want to be a bear.

560
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,360
Me leg's beginning to talk back to me
a little. Will you give me a hand?

561
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,480
I told you to keep
off that leg for another three days.

562
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,080
I'm gonna tuck it in right now, Doctor.

563
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,480
Good night.

564
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,440
Jed.

565
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,920
Sit down.

566
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,560
I'm worried, Jed.

567
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,480
It's the Colonel.

568
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,840
He's not a well man.

569
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,440
It doesn't show
because it's locked inside his head.

570
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,480
He can't sit much longer.

571
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,520
He's got to go out and kill Indians.

572
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,000
Someone's got to stop him.

573
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,600
You got a gun.

574
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,040
Good luck, Mungo.

575
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,880
- Where're you sending him?
- To Laramie.

576
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,000
To bring back orders...

577
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,160
that will keep Col. Marston
inside this fort all winter.

578
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,960
For a while, Captain,
you had me worried about you.

579
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,920
I'm still worried.

580
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,280
Tell me, Captain.

581
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,360
How can you and the Colonel
wear the same kind of uniform...

582
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,160
and still be so different?

583
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,440
It happens, Jed.

584
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,720
He's a soldier.

585
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,360
He's got a wife.

586
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,280
He's got all the things
you said you have to have to be civilised.

587
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,080
Now, how can that be?

588
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,560
We have animals among us.

589
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,680
- Why don't you kill them?
- That'd make us animals, too.

590
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,160
What's the good of being civilised?

591
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,880
Look, I don't have any right
to judge Col. Marston.

592
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,360
Neither do you.

593
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,600
- How do you clean up such a mess?
- There're lawyers and judges.

594
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,000
I knew a lawyer once at a trading post.

595
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,160
He claimed that my furs
were trapped on his land.

596
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,680
- We had strong words.
- What happened?

597
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,160
He was smaller than me.

598
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,960
I know I did wrong, Captain,
but the next time I'll know better.

599
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,000
Next time I'm gonna find me a judge
who sees things my way.

600
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,640
That's a little too civilised.

601
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,160
- Good night, Captain.
- Good night, Jed.

602
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,760
You hunks of mud, now listen to me.

603
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,160
The soles of your shoes
are half an inch thick.

604
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,240
By tonight, you'll be through them...

605
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,920
and marching on the soles of your feet.

606
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,760
But you'll be marching like soldiers.

607
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,720
Anybody don't like it, speak up.

608
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,400
Anybody.

609
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,920
I'm gonna drill you till mess.

610
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,960
You're gonna step out and step out lively.

611
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,440
Calling platoons, forward march!

612
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,400
Left, hut!

613
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,760
Hut, two, three, four!

614
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,800
Water detail ready to leave, sir.

615
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,400
I should think you've stored enough water
in the past week, Lieutenant.

616
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,640
- It's best to be safe, sir.
- I despise that word.

617
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,240
It's for tradesmen, not for soldiers.

618
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,280
How far is Red Cloud's camp
from the stream?

619
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,760
Not very far.

620
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,840
I'd like to see it.

621
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,280
Forward march! Hut, two, three, four!

622
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,600
If one of them don't come back,
you can be thanking yourself.

623
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,400
Take the wagons
to the fort as soon as they're loaded.

624
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,640
Yes, sir.

625
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,880
Benton will take
the water detail back without you.

626
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,000
I want to see Red Cloud's camp.

627
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,720
You won't see anything
that I haven't told you before.

628
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,640
I want to see it myself.

629
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,480
Is this their main camp?

630
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,040
It doesn't look like
they have more than 100 men down there.

631
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,040
They've got a dozen camps
just like this, scattered all over the valley.

632
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,280
They split up. Easier to hunt food that way.

633
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,960
If I had the water detail here...

634
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,280
I could wipe out
that entire camp with a single run.

635
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,120
- We'd better start back.
- What's your hurry?

636
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,040
If we can see them,
pretty soon they'll be able to see us.

637
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,280
I don't see any women.

638
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,040
When an Indian goes to war,
he leaves his woman home.

639
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,200
Does Mrs. Marston's presence
at the fort annoy you?

640
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,080
She should be home, too.

641
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,720
She'll be disappointed to hear that, Cooper.

642
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,920
I thought she rather liked you.

643
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,640
What do you keep stopping for?

644
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,080
- What is it?
- Don't talk.

645
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,040
Cooper.

646
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,120
Get me out of here.

647
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,800
If you'd stayed behind me like you should,
you wouldn't be down there.

648
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,400
Never mind that. Get me out.

649
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,840
You know,
these woods are full of bear traps.

650
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,200
You'll fall into two or three more before
you get out of the trees.

651
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,120
I didn't ask you for a lecture.
Now get me out.

652
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,920
- Colonel, I feel like talking.
- I'm ordering you, Cooper.

653
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,200
Take it easy, Colonel.
I ain't got much to say.

654
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,200
I got an idea you'll listen much better
from where you are.

655
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,240
Cooper, I'm warning you,
if you don't get me...

656
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,120
Take it easy now, Colonel.

657
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,960
That's better.

658
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,520
You know, Colonel,
there's something eating you.

659
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,360
I've seen it before.

660
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,440
Mostly in Indians.

661
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,520
When they get so full of hate,
they can't wait to kill.

662
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,960
I've done some killing myself...

663
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,320
but I never went out looking for it.

664
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,600
I ain't sure, Colonel, that I wouldn't be
doing an awful lot of people...

665
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,160
a big favour
by just letting you stay right where you are.

666
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,640
Get me out!

667
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,200
Shooting me won't do you no good.

668
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,360
It'll only bring Red Cloud down on you.

669
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,680
And won't he be surprised
to find that there ain't no bear in this trap.

670
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,360
All right, Cooper, you've had your little joke.
Now get me out.

671
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,520
I'm going to take you out, Colonel.

672
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,880
But first you've gotta
promise me something.

673
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,040
What?

674
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,360
You being a fancy gent...

675
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,200
I guess I can count on your word.

676
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,240
Yes, you can, if I give it to you.

677
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,000
Give up this crazy notion
of chasing Red Cloud off the earth...

678
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,880
and stay in the fort until the snow comes.

679
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,720
I'm waiting, Colonel.

680
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,000
Colonel, I don't hear nothing.

681
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,560
I'll see you in hell first.

682
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,240
That's harsh talk for a man in a bear pit.

683
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,080
Do you wanna hear it again?

684
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,760
I'll make believe I didn't hear you.
Now let's try it once again.

685
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,480
I'll see you in hell first.

686
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,480
Like Gus says...

687
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,120
that's a real likely possibility.

688
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,720
Cooper.

689
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,360
Cooper.

690
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,960
Cooper.

691
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,640
Cooper, come back here.

692
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,240
Cooper!

693
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:21,760
I wouldn't worry, Mrs. Marston.
Cooper's very much at home out there.

694
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,400
The Colonel isn't.

695
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,160
He's with Jed.

696
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,400
Captain, I'm very worried.

697
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,720
Can't you send some men
out there to look for them?

698
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,200
- I could, if I had a good reason, but...
- There is good reason.

699
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,120
What is it?

700
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,720
Nothing.

701
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,760
I'm sorry I can't help you, Mrs. Marston.

702
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,120
Corporal of the guard,
open the gate. Jed's here.

703
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,920
- Where's Col. Marston?
- I lost him.

704
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,080
You're too good a scout
to lose a man, Cooper.

705
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,680
Indians got him.
Isn't that the way it happened, Jed?

706
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,640
- No. That's not the way it happened.
- I'm sure it wasn't Jed's fault, Glenn.

707
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,080
- Let Jed tell me.
- I already told you. I lost him.

708
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,080
How?

709
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,400
- I didn't touch him, Captain.
- I want a full report.

710
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,600
- You can't put that in the report, Glenn.
- Now, wait a minute.

711
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,160
I dislike Col. Marston
as much as any other man here...

712
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,120
but he was still in command of this fort.

713
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,560
I'll have no part of this murder.

714
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,920
What do you think he was trying to do
to 148 men and women in this fort?

715
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,600
You're not fit
to wear a uniform, you never will be.

716
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,960
He's not coming back.

717
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,440
I didn't touch him.

718
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,360
I didn't have to.

719
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,040
He did it himself.

720
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,040
I did what they all wanted.

721
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,000
It's what you wanted, wasn't it?

722
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,880
Wasn't it?

723
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,200
Speak when I...

724
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,640
Yes, I wished for it.

725
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,920
- But not this way.
- There's no other way.

726
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,000
You can't kill a man by wishing him dead.

727
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,320
Now you look at me
like I was something dirty.

728
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,880
You hate a man,
you pray the Lord will strike.

729
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,120
But when someone
does it for you, you hate him.

730
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:48,360
I have nothing against the Colonel.
He never hurt me.

731
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,440
What I did, I did for you...

732
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,440
and the Captain and the rest of you.

733
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,320
Now, I'm not clean enough to touch you.

734
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,560
- She wouldn't let you do it, would she?
- You're lucky, that's all.

735
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,600
Luck had nothing to do with it.

736
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,360
I know my wife pretty well.
She's a fine person.

737
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,800
Fine people can make mistakes, too.

738
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,000
How long have these men
been on punishment?

739
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,760
Just overnight, sir.

740
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,080
- Release them immediately.
- Yes, sir.

741
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,280
Punishment detail, halt!

742
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,240
Dismissed.

743
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,080
Were you worried about me, Captain?

744
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,080
I was worried about Jed, sir.
I didn't want to see him court-martialled.

745
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,200
If I hadn't returned, I believe you would have
gone through with it.

746
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,760
I'd have hung him.

747
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,200
You're a good officer, Riordan.

748
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,880
I apologise
if I ever questioned your integrity.

749
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,160
Yes, sir.

750
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,600
- Captain.
- Yes, sir.

751
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,720
I want the entire company
fully armed and assembled in three hours.

752
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,480
- The entire company, sir?
- Every man.

753
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,920
Jed.

754
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,960
- Where did you get the blue uniform, lad?
- From an Indian.

755
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,800
- You got no right to wear it, you know that?
- Neither did the Indian.

756
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,400
- Does that help any, Jed?
- Go away, Gus.

757
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,080
No, I'm not going away.

758
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,800
- I'm not your problem, boy.
- No, I ain't got no problems, Gus.

759
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,200
- I ain't got no problems.
- No, no.

760
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,440
You just like
holing up here like a bear, don't you?

761
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,440
And drinking yourself crazy?

762
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,600
- Sorry you brought the Colonel back.
- I ain't glad.

763
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,560
Jed, you did right.

764
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,320
And I'm proud of you.

765
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,280
Makes me feel as though
I didn't bring you up too bad after all.

766
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,040
- I didn't do it for you, Gus.
- She made you, didn't she?

767
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,960
Most likely, she wanted him dead
just as much as you did...

768
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,600
only she couldn't.

769
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,600
That'd be the Christian in her.

770
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:08,000
That's the part of your education
that's most been sadly lacking.

771
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,520
You ain't got no Christian in you.

772
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,600
- I ain't?
- No.

773
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:13,920
There's two kinds of love.

774
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,920
The way you love
and the way a Christian does.

775
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,120
And she can't be had your way.

776
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,480
How do the Christians do?

777
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,640
To begin with,
he don't pine for another man's wife.

778
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,720
- Never?
- Maybe sometimes.

779
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,760
But a good Christian fights it off.

780
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,160
How?

781
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,360
He gets himself another woman.

782
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,800
You mean, a Christian...

783
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,000
Ioves a woman he don't like
because he can't get the one he wants?

784
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,800
I call that real sneaky.

785
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,960
Corpsman: Reilly.

786
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,840
Corporals: Jennings, Langley...

787
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,320
Luis, Madison.

788
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:04,520
Lieutenants: Forsythe, Meredith.

789
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:09,000
Privates: Lucas, Fenton...

790
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Davis, Wilder...

791
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,360
Denny, Holden...

792
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,920
Priar, Jenkins...

793
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,720
Randolf, Russell...

794
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,040
Ryan, Alfasson...

795
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,040
Groven, McKinley.

796
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,160
- Report.
- All present and accounted for, sir.

797
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,480
We're moving out to attack tomorrow night.

798
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:42,640
Not many of you men have seen action.
Maybe you're scared.

799
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,480
As soon as you get
your first encounter behind you...

800
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,280
you'll feel a lot better.

801
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,240
You'll be given orders all along the way.

802
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,280
So don't lose your heads.

803
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,080
Just follow those orders
and you'll be all right.

804
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,400
Thank you.

805
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,400
I'm with you, Colonel...

806
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,000
I'm with you all the way.

807
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,600
I'm sick of being cooped up
behind these walls.

808
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,800
I need room, Colonel.
Elbow room, and lots of it!

809
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,560
You know what, Colonel?

810
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,120
You and me, we're gonna show
those Tetons how to die, aren't we?

811
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,320
I'm gonna get 10 scalps.
How many are you gonna get, Colonel?

812
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,120
I'm gonna get 10.
I'm gonna get 10, before they get mine.

813
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,840
All right, soldier boys,
go find your pretty ladies!

814
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,520
Find them and give them a kiss goodbye!

815
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,240
Make it a big kiss!

816
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,640
Because this is the last kiss
you're ever gonna have!

817
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,480
From now on in,
it's off to the happy hunting ground!

818
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,800
And me and the Colonel
are gonna get there first!

819
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,440
Right, Colonel?

820
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,800
Open the gates!

821
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,000
Open them wide, Red Cloud!

822
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,520
Here we come!

823
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,280
Me and the Colonel...

824
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,720
and all them fine soldier boys.

825
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,640
Open the gate, here I come!

826
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,920
Onward at last!

827
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,680
Lock the gate.

828
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,680
Dismissed.

829
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,440
Red Cloud!

830
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,800
Where are you, Red Cloud?

831
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,400
- They're too close, Sergeant.
- What I aim at, I hit.

832
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,240
Open the gate!

833
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,640
- You're drunk, Cooper.
- Yes, sir.

834
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,000
Go to your quarters and take off that coat.

835
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,640
Yes, sir.

836
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,720
What were you trying
to do out there, kill yourself?

837
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,360
What do you care?

838
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,200
I do.

839
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,040
Why should you?

840
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,960
Because you were doing it for me.

841
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,680
You know, you get me all mixed up.

842
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,080
- Go ahead, laugh at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.

843
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,920
Well, then, be mad at me.

844
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,720
I can't be angry with you.

845
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,520
Well, do something.
Don't just stand there and look at me.

846
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,000
That's all I can do, Jed, is look at you.

847
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,800
Oh, no!

848
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,960
Women.

849
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,720
The next man who mentions
Cooper's name to me...

850
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,360
can expect to walk the punishment yard.

851
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:26,000
There'll be a full inspection
on the post before we leave tonight.

852
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:29,680
Any man who fails to pass it
will wish he'd never been born.

853
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,200
That's all.

854
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,160
Come in.

855
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,520
- Something troubling you, Sergeant?
- The men's morale, sir.

856
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,160
That Cooper riled them last night.
We may have a little trouble.

857
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,320
Have any of the men refused
to march out tonight?

858
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,440
No, sir, not yet...

859
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,640
but Cooper's back,
and I don't know what he's up to.

860
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,240
- What could he be up to?
- That's just it, sir, I don't know.

861
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,640
But if he talks
to the men again, they may refuse to go.

862
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,720
What do you suggest, Sergeant?

863
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,480
I was hoping you'd suggest something, sir.

864
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:18,320
- You don't like the man, do you?
- I hate him.

865
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,120
I don't imagine
it would take much to provoke him.

866
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,800
Very little, sir.

867
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,000
Provoke him.

868
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,280
Yes, sir.

869
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,880
Looking for someone?

870
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,200
The Colonel wants to see you.

871
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:06,840
What for?

872
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,640
He'll tell you.

873
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,600
I'll be there.

874
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,120
I'm supposed to bring you.

875
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,520
You came up the steps awful quiet.

876
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,800
I did.

877
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,240
The way you came
through this door, I don't like it.

878
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,400
No?

879
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,080
I smell trouble.

880
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,360
And you fill the room with it.

881
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,840
Get going.

882
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:38,440
The Colonel doesn't want
to see me, does he?

883
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,440
Why else would I come?

884
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,480
Maybe to kill me.

885
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,080
Why don't you try?

886
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,160
Hold it.

887
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,400
Well, Captain?

888
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,920
Come down here, Cooper.

889
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,840
What are you gonna do to him, Captain?

890
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,320
- What are you gonna do to him, Colonel?
- He killed a man.

891
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,680
- The punishment's clearly prescribed.
- Cooper, come on down...

892
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,960
Run for the mountains, Jed.
They're gonna hang you.

893
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,560
- Gus, get out of my way.
- It's not his fault, Captain. I know it.

894
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,320
Come on down, Jed.

895
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,960
You, too, Captain.

896
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,600
I would've died for this.

897
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,400
It's nothing but a dirty, filthy, blue rag.

898
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,440
Shoot him, Captain. Shoot him.

899
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,560
Shoot him!

900
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,520
- Gus.
- Yeah.

901
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:14,120
We got a chance, ain't we?
To make it back, I mean.

902
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,240
Sure.

903
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,200
It's a real likely possibility.

904
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,040
Aren't you gonna say anything?

905
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,840
What can I say?

906
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,120
You could wish me luck.

907
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,280
I wished you luck the night before Shiloh.

908
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,560
You didn't mean it then...

909
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,400
and you wouldn't mean it now.

910
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,960
Col. Marston...

911
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:54,120
as first officer under your command,
I request you reconsider your plan...

912
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,640
for taking the troops out of this fort.

913
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,680
I've nothing to reconsider.

914
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,720
Capt. Clarke,
escort Col. Marston to his quarters.

915
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,320
Confine him there until further notice.

916
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:08,240
Under what authority
do you choose to ignore my command?

917
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,520
Orders from Gen. Fisbee at Fort Laramie.

918
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,600
- May I see these orders?
- They're en route, sir.

919
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:19,160
I sent Mungo to Laramie a week ago,
requesting this action.

920
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,520
It takes a great deal of courage
to go over your superior's head.

921
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,200
Right or wrong, I respect you for it.

922
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,880
But I can't turn back now.

923
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,720
I can't turn back either, sir.

924
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,280
I'm taking the men out.

925
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,520
You'll have to shoot me in the back.

926
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,120
Col. Marston.

927
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,640
Stop or I'll shoot.

928
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:49,000
Corporal of the guard,
dispatch rider approaching!

929
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,240
I could have
your career for this right here and now...

930
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,800
but I'd be doing the Army a disservice.

931
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:32,040
You showed courage and daring.

932
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,560
That's becoming a rare quality nowadays.

933
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,560
I leave you in command during my absence.

934
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,480
Prepare to mount.

935
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,040
Mount!

936
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,560
By twos, by the left flank!

937
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,200
Go!

938
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:12,760
Forward! Hut!

939
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,080
Close the gates.

940
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,160
Go to your posts.

941
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,800
What are you doing here?

942
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,040
Going with you.

943
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,520
Did the Colonel and the men go out?

944
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,560
Did Gus go with them?

945
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,320
The others still at the fort?

946
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,200
They'll be dead.

947
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,400
- Come.
- Wait.

948
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:21,680
What for?

949
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:24,600
If you're in a hurry, go yourself.

950
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:26,320
No hurry.

951
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:43,280
- What's the matter? Can't you carry it?
- You'll need it.

952
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,480
I'm going with you.

953
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,280
You can't. No more.

954
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,320
Why can't I?

955
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,720
You don't belong up there.

956
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,400
- Why are you going?
- I belong there.

957
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:25,560
We'd best not leave these trees, Colonel.

958
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,960
We haven't seen an Indian so far, have we?

959
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,800
No, sir, but that don't mean
they ain't seen us.

960
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,720
Their strategy's plain.

961
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,520
They're dropping back hoping we'll split up,
so they can pick us off in small patrols.

962
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,960
Maybe...

963
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,480
but I still don't like
going on into that open draw.

964
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,200
They won't fight
unless we force them into it.

965
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:48,600
We're wasting time. Go scout ahead.
We'll wait here.

966
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,200
Aye.

967
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,320
Sound the attack!

968
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,320
Back to the trees! Get back to the trees!

969
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:58,640
Gus. Bucko. It's me, Jed.

970
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,720
Go back to the woods!

971
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:19,960
Back to the trees! Go back to the woods!

972
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,640
Back to the trees.

973
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,760
Back to the fort! Go back to the fort!

974
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,960
Come on, Luke, you ain't dead yet.

975
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:58,920
Back to the fort!
Pick up the wounded! Back to the fort!

976
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,720
Back to the fort! Don't stop for anything!

977
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:04,880
Open the gates.

978
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,760
Take over, Sergeant.

979
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:04,880
Dismissed!

980
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,560
- How'd I do, Captain?
- Fine, soldier, just fine.

981
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,000
Snow, heat, little meat

982
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,080
Famine almost near

983
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:38,800
And still they struggled on,
Hiding every tear

984
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,320
Stout hearts, played their parts

985
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:42,840
In that bygone year

986
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:47,040
Back there, at the last frontier

987
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:50,120
The last frontier

988
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:55,080
The last frontier

989
01:34:55,681 --> 01:34:57,281
