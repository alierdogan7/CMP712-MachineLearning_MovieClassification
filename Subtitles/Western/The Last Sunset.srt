I'll remember it.

173
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:26,884
You'll join me in coffee?
Thank you.

JOHN: O'Malley...

175
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:33,349
I knew some O'Malleys
in Virginia. Tidewater?

176
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:37,062
I'm afraid
they'd be lace curtain,
my people were all shanty.

177
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,119
(LAUGHING)

178
00:17:38,232 --> 00:17:41,633
After you, sir. Take that
chair right over there.

179
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:46,767
I take you for a man
who's handled quite a
lot of cattle in his time.

180
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,331
Oh, I've done
a little bit of
almost everything.

181
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:52,173
Well, I run about
1,000 head on the place.

182
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,946
I plan to trail the herd
up to Texas and
sell them there.

183
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:58,507
Now if you're at
liberty, I could...

184
00:17:58,585 --> 00:18:00,416
Mr. O'Malley
was trailing south.

185
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:04,115
North or south doesn't make
much difference to me,
Mrs. Breckenridge.

186
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:05,715
There, you see?

187
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:10,892
I'm sure my wife echoes
my sentiments in hoping you'll
join us on the trail, sir.

188
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:14,125
I don't think Mr. O'Malley
would be influenced
by my wishes.

189
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:16,499
I hope you won't
always think that, ma'am.

190
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,664
I'm sure that's not
what she meant.

191
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:24,334
Touch up your coffee?

192
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:25,605
Thanks.

193
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:30,743
I'm willing to pay you
a dollar a day, in fact.

194
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:36,818
Plus a $25 bonus
when we deliver the herd
in Crazy Horse, Texas.

195
00:18:37,424 --> 00:18:38,857
Crazy Horse?

196
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:42,061
That's pretty
dangerous country
you're going through.

197
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:47,464
And you need
two men you haven't got.
Fast gun and a trail boss.

198
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,626
I don't know any more
about cows than you do,

199
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:51,933
so if I go as the gun,
where's the trail boss?

200
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,599
Well, I haven't got one.
I wasn't able to find anybody.

201
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,609
I know one. Good one.

202
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,110
Think you can get him?

203
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,605
He'll probably be
here by tomorrow.

204
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,679
Maybe even today.

205
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,488
You think he'll take the job?

206
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:11,750
He just might.

207
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,620
You see, this fellow and
I are kind of bound up
with each other.

208
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,528
But with or without him,
my terms are gonna be
pretty high.

209
00:19:18,598 --> 00:19:21,863
Well, you just
name your terms,
Mr. O'Malley.

210
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:24,561
Only two.

211
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,430
First I take
a fifth of the herd.

212
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:28,997
It's outrageous.

213
00:19:29,443 --> 00:19:32,241
Well, I fight better when
part of the property's mine.

214
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:34,007
But that's exorbitant.

215
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:36,342
You think about it.

216
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:46,119
All right. All right,
you've got your fifth.
Good.

217
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,662
Now, wait a minute, you
said you had two conditions.
What's the second?

218
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,095
Oh, yes, the second.

219
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:53,090
I want your wife.

220
00:19:57,971 --> 00:20:00,098
You're joking.
No.

221
00:20:00,774 --> 00:20:04,005
If I get the herd
through for you,
I mean to take your wife.

you'd try to circle around

Well, a lot of

I got a warrant
for your arrest.

239
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:28,814
I'm taking you back to
Frio County, Texas,
to stand trial.

240
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:38,259
Will you come voluntarily
or will I have to take you?

241
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,734
Say, it just happens
that I'm just headed
for Texas right now.

it isn't Frio County,

if I had to kill you here.

and find out?

Why not?

discussed the possibilities

292
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:42,576
Well, Mr. Breckenridge,
to pull the 1,000
head of cattle,

293
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:46,983
you need two good point
riders, four swing riders,
and one man on the tail.

294
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,250
You need a man to drive
the mules, a trail cook,
a wrangler for the horses,

295
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:52,917
plus four horses
in the remuda
for each rider.

296
00:25:52,992 --> 00:25:55,460
I got plenty of horses
in the remuda.

297
00:25:55,562 --> 00:25:57,860
My wife drove a chuck wagon
coming down here

298
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,832
and she's perfectly willing
to drive one going back.

299
00:26:01,134 --> 00:26:02,897
And she's an
excellent trail cook.

300
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:04,698
Then she counts
for two men.

301
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,595
You've married well.

00:26:07,974 --> 00:26:09,066

work cattle on a horse.

it means God let him,

if he wanted to, couldn't he?

her young sea-colt
wrapped in a shy sea-dream.

all of the people known
can absolutely say

368
00:31:21,054 --> 00:31:26,321
that the foam on the sea
is a sign that you see
the mare and her colt at play.

or even what you looked like.

1020
01:42:22,978 --> 01:42:24,639
Then I found you.

1021
01:42:25,013 --> 01:42:28,039
And now,
I'll have you forever.

1022
01:42:30,118 --> 01:42:31,346
Forever?

1023
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:32,580
Mmm-hmm.

1024
01:42:37,459 --> 01:42:39,484
You know something, Missy?

1025
01:42:40,629 --> 01:42:43,063
I'm old enough
to be your father.

1026
01:42:43,398 --> 01:42:45,696
What difference
does that make?

1027
01:42:46,368 --> 01:42:49,360
Well, it means
that some day,
you'll be alone.

1028
01:42:50,038 --> 01:42:52,666
I won't be with
you anymore,

1029
01:42:54,009 --> 01:42:56,842
and so you'll have to find
someone else to love.

1030
01:42:58,513 --> 01:43:02,847
That's silly.
I couldn't love anybody
else but you. I couldn't.

1031
01:43:04,286 --> 01:43:06,254
There's something
wrong with us, Missy.

1032
01:43:06,321 --> 01:43:07,618
But why?

1033
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:11,953
Because if you ever
really love, you have
to go on loving.

1034
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:17,165
It's like a mountain spring.
If it stops flowing,
there's no more spring.

1035
01:43:18,633 --> 01:43:22,399
And if you stop loving,
just because
something happens to me,

1036
01:43:22,471 --> 01:43:24,632
there's no more Missy.

1037
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:32,746
You mean, you'd want me
to find somebody else?

1038
01:43:35,917 --> 01:43:39,284
If you really loved me,
you'd have to find
someone else.

1039
01:43:40,522 --> 01:43:44,549
And the day you found him,
and gave him all the love
you once gave me...

1040
01:43:45,527 --> 01:43:47,188
Oh, Missy, Missy.

1041
01:43:48,363 --> 01:43:52,697
On that day,
all the angels in heaven
will shout for joy.

1042
01:43:53,635 --> 01:43:57,731
And the stars will bend low
to chime your wedding bells.

1043
01:43:59,207 --> 01:44:00,970
And I'll hear them.

1044
01:44:02,010 --> 01:44:03,534
And I'll smile.

1045
01:44:08,049 --> 01:44:10,279
And then I'll
go to sleep again,

1046
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,782
content.

1047
01:44:22,264 --> 01:44:23,458
Missy?

1048
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,763
Are you all through?

1049
01:44:29,171 --> 01:44:30,229
I'm not sure.

1050
01:44:30,305 --> 01:44:31,966
Because I'm
not listening.

1051
01:44:33,141 --> 01:44:34,506
(LAUGHING)

1052
01:44:34,943 --> 01:44:36,706
Already I'm a bore.

1053
01:44:40,382 --> 01:44:41,440
No.

1054
01:44:44,486 --> 01:44:46,647
It's time to get
our horses.

1055
01:44:49,157 --> 01:44:52,058
I'll pick up your
saddlebags at the hotel.

1056
01:44:52,627 --> 01:44:54,754
You wait for me
right here.

1057
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,964
You'll come right back
to me, won't you?

1058
01:45:15,517 --> 01:45:17,678
When that sun
goes down over there,

1059
01:45:18,587 --> 01:45:20,919
just below
the rim of the hills,

1060
01:45:21,556 --> 01:45:23,683
I'll come
right back to you.

1061
01:46:25,387 --> 01:46:26,877
(CATTLE LOWING)

1062
01:46:40,535 --> 01:46:41,968
(DOG BARKING)

1063
01:49:00,975 --> 01:49:02,203
(GUN FIRING)

1064
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:06,442
O'Malley!

1065
01:50:08,777 --> 01:50:10,642
It wasn't even loaded.

1066
01:51:26,988 --> 01:51:30,480
He told me to give you this,
in case anything happened.

1067
01:51:41,202 --> 01:51:42,533
Primroses.

1068
01:51:45,974 --> 01:51:48,272
You said you'd
give them to me.
