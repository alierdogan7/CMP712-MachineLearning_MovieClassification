00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:19,494
How'd you sleep?

373
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,798
You're going to be fine, soldier.

374
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:06,229
Uh, how's Newt?

375
00:41:06,294 --> 00:41:08,165
We're out of turpentine.

376
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:12,212
Captain, what do we do?

377
00:41:14,918 --> 00:41:18,580
Oh...
I don't know.

378
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:22,309
We need to feed the boys
back at the Cumberland Gap.

379
00:41:22,373 --> 00:41:25,349
And that old farmer
and his wife.

380
00:41:25,414 --> 00:41:28,084
We should report back

381
00:41:28,149 --> 00:41:31,876
that there's some
guerrilla outfit

382
00:41:31,941 --> 00:41:34,917
running around killing Unionists.

383
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:37,844
I think we got to wait Newt out.

384
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:42,708
He's too sick to ride.

385
00:41:42,773 --> 00:41:45,380
We could hitch up the wagon
to the mule,

386
00:41:45,445 --> 00:41:47,636
haul Newt out.

387
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:50,228
Giddyup, giddyup.

388
00:41:50,293 --> 00:41:52,404
I won't let that
woman and boy

389
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,291
root hog or starve.

390
00:41:54,356 --> 00:41:56,260
No. No, sir.

391
00:42:05,508 --> 00:42:06,452
Whoa.

392
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:12,740
Will you let me do that?

393
00:42:12,805 --> 00:42:14,323
I don't need your help.

394
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:18,083
Well, I like working with mules.

395
00:42:21,893 --> 00:42:23,971
How's your hands?

396
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:28,323
Blisters on top of blisters.

397
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:32,211
Let me see.

398
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:35,026
Let me see.

399
00:42:50,996 --> 00:42:53,058
All right.

400
00:42:54,387 --> 00:42:56,178
That's fine. Thank you.

401
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,146
Come on!

402
00:43:50,914 --> 00:43:53,506
I told you I got you.

403
00:43:53,555 --> 00:43:57,313
I told you.

404
00:43:57,378 --> 00:44:01,041
Captain, Newt took a poop.

405
00:44:03,634 --> 00:44:06,161
I guess that's a good sign.

406
00:44:12,482 --> 00:44:17,025
Rodie, make sure
you clean up this porch.

407
00:44:23,777 --> 00:44:26,831
My stomach hurts.

408
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:29,344
Worse than yesterday?

409
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:31,488
Mm-mmm.

410
00:44:35,265 --> 00:44:37,872
Oh, you'll be fine.

411
00:44:37,937 --> 00:44:40,464
You're not as hot.

412
00:44:43,616 --> 00:44:45,695
How's he doing?

413
00:44:45,761 --> 00:44:48,751
He's fine.

414
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,215
I'll make you some
sassafras tea.

415
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,920
She's pretty.

416
00:45:05,824 --> 00:45:07,791
You are feeling better.

417
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,015
[Laughing]

418
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,279
[Spits]

419
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:15,647
Ohh...

420
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:19,070
Hey, Johnny, I'm sorry.

421
00:45:19,135 --> 00:45:21,502
You crossed my artillery line there.

422
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,343
Here, I'll let you spit back.

423
00:45:27,407 --> 00:45:29,614
Go ahead.

424
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,551
You're scaring the boy.

425
00:45:31,615 --> 00:45:33,502
No, he ain't scared.
Are you, Johnny?

426
00:45:38,191 --> 00:45:41,390
Go ahead...
Spit.

427
00:45:48,351 --> 00:45:51,198
Neely: Rodie,
you got a mean streak.

428
00:45:53,215 --> 00:45:56,031
Cool and deliberate.

429
00:46:59,646 --> 00:47:01,372
[Coughing and gagging]

430
00:47:22,028 --> 00:47:24,204
[Wheezing]

431
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:12,139
Captain?

432
00:48:14,044 --> 00:48:15,018
Neely.

433
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:17,946
Uh, chicken's cooked.

434
00:48:34,843 --> 00:48:36,986
Yes, yes.

435
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,113
I told you it was going
to get burnt.

436
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:42,633
Pow...

437
00:48:42,698 --> 00:48:44,457
Pow.

438
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,625
Chicago: You are looking
rather well this evening.

439
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:02,169
Leave him alone!

440
00:49:02,234 --> 00:49:03,753
Go to hell.

441
00:49:08,874 --> 00:49:09,690
Chicago: Rodie!

442
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:14,233
Hey, hey, hey!

443
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:15,849
Is she crazy, captain?

444
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:17,368
Bastard!

445
00:49:17,434 --> 00:49:19,769
Rodie hit her dog.

446
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:22,953
That damn Johnny dog
ate my food, captain.

447
00:49:23,017 --> 00:49:24,697
Soldier, I want you
to apologize.

448
00:49:24,746 --> 00:49:26,776
I'm telling you, captain,
that woman is crazy.

449
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:29,145
If you want another plate,
you'll apologize.

450
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:31,353
She hit me with
a damn bucket!

451
00:49:31,417 --> 00:49:33,689
Common decency tells you
you don't pick up a woman

452
00:49:33,754 --> 00:49:35,528
and throw her against a wall!

453
00:49:35,577 --> 00:49:37,576
Private, you're dismissed!

454
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,129
Sir!

455
00:49:41,897 --> 00:49:43,833
Hope you get a piece.

456
00:49:49,225 --> 00:49:51,272
What'd you say, soldier?

457
00:49:51,337 --> 00:49:52,889
Rodie, shut up.

458
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:56,136
Spent your whole damn day, what?

459
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,248
Plowing her corn.
You cut her wood.

460
00:50:00,312 --> 00:50:04,263
I'm sure she thinks you're
a damn good samaritan.

461
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:05,992
You know what I think?

462
00:50:06,056 --> 00:50:09,527
I think you just want
a little poke.

463
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:16,759
Rodie!
Rodie, stop it!

464
00:50:16,825 --> 00:50:18,088
Come on, Rodie!

465
00:50:22,537 --> 00:50:23,527
Rodie!

466
00:50:23,576 --> 00:50:25,606
I hope you kills each other.

467
00:50:25,672 --> 00:50:28,535
You rot in hell.

468
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:31,127
You rot in hell!

469
00:50:54,055 --> 00:50:57,766
Come here.
Come here.

470
00:50:57,831 --> 00:51:01,174
We can't just sit by.

471
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,198
I want you to go tonight,

472
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:05,799
to preacher's house.

473
00:51:05,815 --> 00:51:07,750
And tell him that
there's Yankees here,

474
00:51:07,816 --> 00:51:09,702
and he should get word
to our people.

475
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,750
Don't talk to anyone
but preacher.

476
00:51:11,816 --> 00:51:13,814
And you have to be back
before sunup.

477
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:16,269
- You understand me?
- Yes, ma'am.

478
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:22,310
These are yours.

479
00:51:27,463 --> 00:51:28,533
Go on.

480
00:51:36,422 --> 00:51:38,678
And I'm sorry.

481
00:51:42,564 --> 00:51:44,372
There was some...

482
00:51:44,776 --> 00:51:47,565
ugly things said tonight about...

483
00:51:49,638 --> 00:51:51,365
They weren't true.

484
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,701
No?

485
00:51:58,054 --> 00:52:00,389
Don't think they were true.

486
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,420
Your little girl died, and...

487
00:52:06,485 --> 00:52:11,781
Well, my wife died
3 years ago.

488
00:52:11,845 --> 00:52:14,101
I miss her.

489
00:52:16,597 --> 00:52:19,124
Miss my farm, my boy.

490
00:52:21,957 --> 00:52:23,316
I come here to your place,

491
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:28,500
and it looks a lot
like my place...

492
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,580
We ain't gonna be friends.

493
00:52:36,645 --> 00:52:41,108
Let's just keep
to being enemies.

494
00:52:43,444 --> 00:52:44,980
Yes, ma'am.

495
00:52:48,341 --> 00:52:50,164
I forgot.

496
00:52:50,229 --> 00:52:52,307
You have a better memory.

497
00:53:33,716 --> 00:53:36,402
Ahem...

498
00:53:36,467 --> 00:53:37,794
Is Newt asleep?

499
00:53:40,275 --> 00:53:41,138
Yeah.

500
00:53:48,596 --> 00:53:52,626
You know,
I don't think Rodie

501
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:55,362
mean to be disrespecting.

502
00:53:58,786 --> 00:54:02,657
His brother was killed
by a rebel sniper.

503
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:07,281
He get crazy thinking
about it. He's...

504
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:15,090
Where are you from?

505
00:54:17,442 --> 00:54:18,833
Chicago.

506
00:54:20,723 --> 00:54:22,898
No, I mean before that.

507
00:54:22,962 --> 00:54:26,720
This small village in Poland.

508
00:54:26,786 --> 00:54:28,353
It's just very small.

509
00:54:28,418 --> 00:54:31,776
You damn foreigner.

510
00:54:31,842 --> 00:54:33,569
Why get mixed up in this?

511
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:36,417
I think I get to see new places,

512
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:40,241
I get tired of chopping sausage.

513
00:54:40,306 --> 00:54:43,281
Pretty thin reason
to get shot at.

514
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,697
You got a better one?

515
00:54:45,762 --> 00:54:48,928
I've heard your big reasons.

516
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,760
To save the union.

517
00:54:51,778 --> 00:54:56,352
This is what the generals say.

518
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:59,073
To free the slaves?

519
00:54:59,137 --> 00:55:01,329
Nobody that I know
want to get killed

520
00:55:01,394 --> 00:55:04,080
to free a bunch of nigs.

521
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:08,465
It's a mess, ain't it?

522
00:55:11,554 --> 00:55:14,927
Why did you...
Sign up?

523
00:55:14,993 --> 00:55:17,680
Minister.

524
00:55:20,337 --> 00:55:23,263
Brought a runaway slave
into our church

525
00:55:23,329 --> 00:55:27,648
and ripped off his shirt.

526
00:55:27,712 --> 00:55:32,334
Showed off the ugliest
damn strap scars.

527
00:55:34,021 --> 00:55:36,207
Right there from the pulpit,

528
00:55:36,272 --> 00:55:39,055
the minister asked
for volunteers,

529
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,959
and I stood up,
and here I am...

530
00:55:44,448 --> 00:55:47,711
Stealing chickens.

531
00:55:55,664 --> 00:55:57,615
Hold on!

532
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,862
Preacher:
Who's there, Israel?

533
00:56:00,928 --> 00:56:04,590
It's Miss Anders' boy.

534
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:07,455
They came up the creek on horses.

535
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:13,215
How many Yankees is there?

536
00:56:16,176 --> 00:56:18,303
4...
5.

537
00:56:19,904 --> 00:56:20,703
Which?

538
00:56:20,767 --> 00:56:24,462
5.
One's hurt real bad.

539
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:31,726
Pharaoh sent his army
to smite Israel.

540
00:56:34,175 --> 00:56:36,925
And they drowned
in the Red Sea.

541
00:56:43,935 --> 00:56:48,317
It was wrong what they
done to your sister.

542
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:51,661
God's will is a powerful thing.

543
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:05,374
Mama, mama.

544
00:57:05,438 --> 00:57:07,740
Where's your shoes?

545
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:14,125
What did preacher say?
What?

546
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,709
That's it's going to be all right.

547
00:57:15,773 --> 00:57:17,789
Is he going to get word
to our people?

548
00:57:17,853 --> 00:57:18,733
To your pap?

549
00:57:18,797 --> 00:57:20,077
I think so.

550
00:57:20,142 --> 00:57:22,156
Don't be so thick.
What did he say?

551
00:57:22,222 --> 00:57:24,924
I can't understand him.

552
00:57:51,774 --> 00:57:56,140
Rodie, you can get shot
for desertion.

553
00:58:03,421 --> 00:58:05,324
You ain't gonna do it.

554
00:58:05,372 --> 00:58:08,076
What makes you so sure?

555
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:12,603
Because...

Get that damn Yankee
out of our yard.

743
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:23,430
<i>The captain asked us
to do the decent thing.</i>

744
01:23:25,446 --> 01:23:29,509
<i>I don't guess the Civil War
was about being decent.</i>

745
01:23:32,998 --> 01:23:35,333
<i>We dug up
the big redhead</i>

746
01:23:35,398 --> 01:23:38,164
<i>and floated him down
Meshack Creek.</i>

747
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:41,701
<i>Ma said he come up that creek
to cause trouble,</i>

748
01:23:41,765 --> 01:23:45,205
<i>and we sent him back down
where he come from.</i>

749
01:23:52,405 --> 01:23:55,445
<i>We drug the skinny
Yankee up a hill</i>

750
01:23:55,494 --> 01:23:57,460
<i>to a sinkhole.</i>

751
01:23:57,525 --> 01:24:00,181
<i>Where a big sycamore tree
had fallen over</i>

752
01:24:00,246 --> 01:24:03,045
<i>and turned up its roots.</i>

753
01:24:03,109 --> 01:24:06,708
<i>We throwed the skinny Yankee
in the sinkhole,</i>

754
01:24:06,773 --> 01:24:08,724
<i>throwed some dirt on him.</i>

755
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:11,988
<i>I don't guess Ma hated
the skinny Yankee</i>

756
01:24:12,053 --> 01:24:15,044
<i>as much as the big redhead.</i>

757
01:24:15,109 --> 01:24:16,532
[Thunder rumbles]

758
01:24:16,597 --> 01:24:19,524
<i>Pap never made it back.</i>

759
01:24:19,589 --> 01:24:22,628
<i>That war was a widow-maker.</i>

760
01:24:30,868 --> 01:24:34,660
<i>Ma told me to never
never tell anyone</i>

761
01:24:34,724 --> 01:24:38,772
<i>What we had done.</i>

762
01:24:38,837 --> 01:24:42,771
<i>And I don't think I ever did...</i>

763
01:24:42,837 --> 01:24:47,587
<i>Except maybe once,
or maybe twice.</i>

764
01:25:03,459 --> 01:25:06,403
[Rain falling]

765
01:25:15,283 --> 01:25:19,138
# Temptation ceased

766
01:25:19,203 --> 01:25:23,971
# Calling her song

767
01:25:24,772 --> 01:25:29,164
# The road to the battle
lays down #

768
01:25:31,299 --> 01:25:36,162
# Sweet Jesus,
sweet child #

769
01:25:36,227 --> 01:25:40,802
# Take this one here

770
01:25:41,264 --> 01:25:46,430
# We give it to you
this day #

771
01:25:47,651 --> 01:25:52,802
# When the reaping is done

772
01:25:52,867 --> 01:25:57,154
# When we labor no more

773
01:25:57,219 --> 01:26:00,818
# When the reaping is done

774
01:26:00,882 --> 01:26:05,362
# When we labor no more

775
01:26:05,836 --> 01:26:11,608
# When the reaping is done
this day #

776
01:26:13,554 --> 01:26:18,497
# Sweet Jesus,
sweet child #

777
01:26:18,562 --> 01:26:21,537
# Take this one here

778
01:26:22,058 --> 01:26:27,367
# We give it to you this day #

779
01:26:29,847 --> 01:26:35,619
# We give it to you this day #
