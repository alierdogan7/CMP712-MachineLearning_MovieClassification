1
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,827
Well, how you doing today, young fella?

2
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,736
- All done. Just getting ready to leave.
- Fine.

3
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:58,903
- You're egg and a Coca-Cola.
- No, sir. Egg and make it a beer today.

4
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,138
Fine.

5
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,480
That must be pretty interesting work
you have there.

6
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:12,251
Traveling around the country,
meeting all manners of people.

7
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,453
Well, it's not a regular job.
I'm a sociology major in college.

8
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,189
Just took this for the summer.

9
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,364
Still, it's a good job.

10
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:24,095
Getting three days wages for counting
noses in a no-place town like this.

11
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,370
I took longer than I thought.

12
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:30,031
But then I had to fight off the tiger.

13
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,703
I believe I know what you mean.

14
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:39,048
Did you know that there are, as far
as the US Census Bureau is concerned...

15
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:43,020
789 people alive in Coldiron, Texas,
at this moment?

16
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,220
That sounds about right.

17
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,327
But of those 789 people,
48 are named Jonas...

18
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,796
36 are named Jessie, 53 are named Maria...

19
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:56,062
and 33 have the Christian name
of "Reprisal<i>"...</i>

20
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,535
which I didn't even know
was a Christian name.

21
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,003
Didn't you?

22
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,801
You know, at first it seemed like
they took me for a reporter...

23
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,639
instead of a census taker.

24
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,211
Most of them kept wanting to tell me a story.

25
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:12,045
- Did they?
- Well, I had a job to do.

26
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,022
Well, I guess every place and everybody
has got to have something.

27
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:22,190
- Yellowstone has Old Faithful<i>...</i>
- And New York's got the Yankees. Yeah.

28
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,822
Yeah.

29
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:28,196
Well, Coldiron, it's got its violent
and tender memories.

30
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:33,438
The Mexicans, they call it
<i>La Noche del Tigre.</i>

31
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,403
To us it's known as
the Night of the Reprisals.

32
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:43,371
- Can I buy you a beer, sir?
- Well, thank you, son.

33
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,353
What happened? The Reprisals.

34
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,526
I didn't think you cared to hear.

35
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,090
Well, not on the job.

36
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,096
- Like drinking?
- Yeah.

37
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,696
- See that old Mexican boy over there?
- Yeah.

38
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,703
Well, he can't see you. He's blind.

39
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:13,644
His name is Raul Y Reprisal Mendoza.

40
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:18,948
He was born on that night.
August 16, 1884. Born blind.

41
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:23,981
At the sight of Jonas Trapp, the Tiger,
his mother started a-running...

42
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,215
and she fell in an alley
in back of the saloon...

43
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,261
and he was born right there...

44
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,059
while Jonas Trapp
went on with his killing in the front.

45
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:36,124
The first sound that he heard
was the bark of the Tiger's gun.

46
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,336
That gun right there.

47
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:55,178
- But it sounds like the end of the story.
- Maybe.

48
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,784
Where does it start?

49
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,822
Why...

50
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,795
nobody can really say.

51
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:10,098
I guess it really started when Jonas Trapp
was finally coming home.

52
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,534
It wasn't the land
that was drawing him back...

53
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:19,668
the land that God stomped
the dust off his feet on.

54
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,707
<i>After 11 years, Jonas was coming back</i>
<i>to his wife, Jessie.</i>

55
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,984
<i>Only Jessie didn't know it.</i>

56
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,614
<i>He was a man high and wide, Jonas Trapp.</i>

57
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:36,822
<i>Buffalo hunter and freighter.</i>
<i>He was frost-bitten, famined.</i>

58
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:41,892
<i>Shot at by the whiskey-mad killer,</i>
<i>Clay Allison, and by Indians.</i>

59
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:46,632
<i>And now, after 11 years,</i>
<i>he was uncertain and impatient.</i>

60
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:51,400
<i>He was juiced-out by the sun</i>
<i>and gut-lonesome for his wife.</i>

61
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,741
<i>Eleven years,</i>
<i>and not once he had written her.</i>

62
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,874
<i>But he wasn't coming back</i>
<i>any common hoe-hand on a dirt farm.</i>

63
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:03,250
<i>He was coming back a rich man,</i>
<i>though he didn't look it.</i>

64
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,648
<i>And he didn't want to, yet.</i>

65
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,159
<i>In his saddlebags,</i>
<i>the ghosts of untold buffalo...</i>

66
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,355
and 11 years hard labor.

67
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:15,664
<i>As men count it, $17,000.</i>

68
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,496
<i>Jonas Trapp got what he went after.</i>

69
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:23,035
<i>And now he'd find out</i>
<i>if he still had what he left behind.</i>

70
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,396
Damn it.

71
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,896
Well, horse...

72
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,839
Iooks like you've got to go barefoot
the rest of the way.

73
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,636
Too much distance for tonight.

74
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:05,814
I shouldn't ought to let Jessie see me
all whiskered and smelly, anyway.

75
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,845
But morning, new clothes...

76
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,651
a clean shave, and a hot tub bath.

77
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,117
Yeah.

78
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,595
You know, I been talking to you
for six years now, but come morning<i>...</i>

79
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,859
You know, I keep forgetting.

80
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,598
You ain't never seen this
no-creation place before, have you?

81
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,835
Coldiron's only a couple,
three hours away...

82
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,835
and over that rim yonder
runs the Little Dirty.

83
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:39,781
Me and Jessie used
to picnic there and swim, and<i>...</i>

84
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,384
Hey, horse, look.

85
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,226
Looks like we found us
our camp partner for tonight.

86
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,858
And maybe a razor.
And maybe some fresh coffee.

87
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,535
Not for you, for me.

88
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,736
Come on, you three-legged cayuse.

89
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,307
Hello to camp!

90
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,584
Hello to camp!

91
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,783
If you don't mind,
I'll help myself to some coffee...

92
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,458
trade you tobacco.

93
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,811
Moonlighter.

94
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,552
All right, thief!

95
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,118
Just wiggle, I'll blow your shaggy head off
smack into the crick!

96
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,817
We got him cold, by God.

97
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,488
Cold.

98
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,961
- You're kind of crossed up.
- Yeah, we are?

99
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,599
Hey, Johnsy Boy, come take a look.

100
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,095
He is a stud, ain't he?

101
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,101
- I was just passing, l...
- Like hell.

102
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,910
What I aimed to say, I just now rode up.

103
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,642
Wanted me a hot water shave,
and some coffee.

104
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,981
That's a Circle "C" calf
you got your pigging string on.

105
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:59,455
- Mister, that ain't no string of mine.
- Hold up, you two.

106
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,293
Let's have a look.

107
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,489
Now look, if it's a thief you're looking for,
you ain't found him.

108
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,123
- Now, I seen someone light out...
- What'd he look like?

109
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,998
- Well, like I said, sir, he was lighting out.
- He's lying.

110
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,971
- Coates, shut him up.
- Hell, yes. Shut up!

111
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,769
Lift his iron, Johnsy Boy.

112
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,616
What is that stink?

113
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,114
Buffler.

114
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,180
- What?
- Buffler, damn it. This one's a hunter.

115
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:36,625
Buffalo hunters always smell that way.
They smell like old guts all the time.

116
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,889
- I had enough, I'd better be...
- All right.

117
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,195
Just as long as you can do it
without moving.

118
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,864
- That is a Circle "C" heifer, ain't it, Brooks?
- That's right.

119
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,167
Well?

120
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:55,003
Being as I'm Circle "C" foreman,
I'd reason I got to say-so here then?

121
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,147
That's right.

122
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,080
You call the shots, Coates.

123
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,852
He may be calling your shots,
Johnsy Boy, but not mine.

124
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,016
- Mr. Brooks, what I've been trying to...
- The name is Durham. Brooks Durham.

125
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,390
- Well, I come up off the trail...
- Look at him!

126
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,762
Who'd believe anybody who look like that?

127
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,864
Well, I may not be laced up
and doused with toilet water...

128
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,870
but I'm getting damned sick
of being put on as a thief.

129
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,168
Well, a thief's what you are
and we hang thieves.

130
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,707
Now hold up, Coates.

131
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,676
I bargained to ride out here
for a game of poker, nothing like this.

132
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,374
Now you may not want to turn him loose,
but hanging's another thing.

133
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,113
Hey, Durham...

134
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,782
why don't you just ride back on into town?
Me and Johnsy Boy can take care of him...

135
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,255
- Coates, you're drunk and he's a...
- Why, yes, I'm drunk, I<i>...</i>

136
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,416
That sets me at my best.

137
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,357
You're not hanging a man
for stealing one miserable...

138
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,191
Why, I wager he stole more than that.

139
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,697
The Circle "C"s been
missing a lot of cows lately.

140
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,461
Why, I'm foreman!

141
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,229
It's two days ride to Hudlow
and the Ranger station.

142
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,067
I say just here and now, we string him up.

143
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,108
Coates, there's a rifle on that horse.

144
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,302
Now if you want to do any hanging,
you'd better kill me before I get to it.

145
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,938
Now what's all the hassle? I catch me
a thief, I aim to bring him to his milk.

146
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,812
Mister, you ain't caught no thief.

147
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:10,385
You are one dirty, filthy,
smelly thief, aren't you?

148
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,824
Johnsy Boy, you make me sick!

149
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:28,967
A man don't steal no $4 calf
when he's got money enough to buy...

150
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,251
<i>No, don't!</i>
<i>No, don't shoot him! We'll burn him.</i>

151
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,824
<i>- Burn him!</i>
<i>- No hanging.</i>

152
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,586
<i>We'll burn him, that's what we'll do.</i>

153
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,183
<i>No hanging, Coates.</i>

154
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,162
<i>We're going to burn him.</i>

155
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,856
<i>But, no hanging.</i>

156
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,772
<i>- That'll take care of him.</i>
<i>- I'm gonna kill him.</i>

157
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,599
<i>But, no hanging.</i>

158
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:10,008
<i>Come on, Johnsy Boy. We'll burn him.</i>

159
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,211
<i>But, no hanging.</i>

160
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,878
Listen, the horses are spooking. Get them.

161
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,081
Good boy, Johnsy. I'll fix him.

162
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,524
Now, Johnsy Boy,
you're gonna burn him, ain't you?

163
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,495
Burn him. Brand him?

164
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,837
He's going to brand him, now.

165
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,069
He's going to brand a "T" on you.
"T" for thief.

166
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,871
"T," Johnsy, for thief.

167
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,188
Cut that out!

168
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,953
God, you'll burn him through.
Now, stop it or I'll kill the both of you.

169
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,636
Jessie.

170
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,908
Jessie.

171
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,315
Jonas?

172
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,917
Jonas, you just stop your teasing.

173
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,956
Jonas, I'm never coming out here
with you again.

174
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,016
Now you know how fierce Aunt Gussie gets
when I get home after dark.

175
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,518
Your Aunt Gussie was born fierce.
But I got a present for her.

176
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,350
You do? What?

177
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,120
Jonas Trapp, come on now.

178
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,525
Doesn't Aunt Gussie like frogs?

179
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,824
No, she doesn't like frogs.
Now get your shirt on.

180
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,526
- Do you like frogs?
- Jonas.

181
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,373
Having some fun
around the crick's one thing...

182
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,508
but fooling yourself into thinking
something serious can come...

183
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,845
with you and that gal
is something else again.

184
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,476
You're a mite tardy with the father talk.

185
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,147
Adopted or no, you ain't been that to me
since your wife died.

186
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,021
You never mind about her.

187
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:38,192
Ten years now, Dub,
you and me still can't talk.

188
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:42,665
- She was the only mother I ever knew.
- Sure she was.

189
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,563
When she keeled over from the sun
pounding clothes in Dirty Crick...

190
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,299
and I fished them clothes out,
every last piece belonged to you.

191
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,811
Not even a sock of mine.

192
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,712
Well, I been washing your socks
for 10 years now, and...

193
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,909
working this nothing patch.

194
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,579
Still not a fair swap. Not for her.

195
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,713
You don't want to lose me either,
do you, Dub?

196
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,087
'Cause then who'd work this place...

197
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,752
and how'd you go chasing
your town women...

198
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,659
and drinking yourself into a fog
every night?

199
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,025
It's not that, Jonas.
You'll see, she just won't have you.

200
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,043
Jessie, I've come to call at your house.

201
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,938
Well, come in, Jonas.

202
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,790
Jessie...

203
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,455
I want to talk to you for a moment.

204
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,859
In private.

205
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,709
You stay in here.
I'll be back in just a minute.

206
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,212
Jonas, thank you.

207
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,623
Jessie, I want you to get<i>...</i>

208
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,962
To get him out of this house.

209
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,265
Aunt Gussie...

210
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,944
Jonas and I are going to be married.

211
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,616
I'll tell you why.

212
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,947
Goodbye!

213
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,186
Where they gonna live?
With you or at the mansion?

214
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,138
Come in.

215
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,679
You may use the first room
to the right of the stairs, rent free...

216
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,312
for as long as you like.

217
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,585
- Good morning, missus.
- Jonas.

218
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,784
Coffee?

219
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,926
Put the cup down, Jonas.

220
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,743
Well, what do you need to work for?

221
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,387
You married rich and right, didn't you?

222
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:04,260
Was I you, I'd just stay in the mansion
and service that filly.

223
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,932
Jessie.

224
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,974
Jessie, we're moving out of here.

225
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,238
We are?

226
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,676
Whatever for?

227
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:01,048
So we can make it on our own,
or bust in a furrow of our own choosing.

228
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,847
Isn't it nice enough here?

229
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:10,987
It may be nice for you, Jessie,
but months now, I been cleaning slops...

230
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:15,993
swamping bars part-time.
Doing a boy's work for a boy's wages.

231
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:20,599
Well, out of them wages,
I saved enough to get us to Kansas.

232
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,863
My mind's set.

233
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:24,901
It is?

234
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,544
- Shouldn't we have talked it over?
- Well, that's what we're doing.

235
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,674
You see, in Kansas,
there's men who'll stake you to an outfit.

236
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,278
You kill buffalo, fetch in the hides,
and split the profits.

237
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,253
I shoot good, Jessie.

238
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,083
I know you do.

239
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,958
But those hunting camps, they're just filthy.
Now where would we live?

240
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,556
Maybe we can get you a room in Dodge.

241
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,194
And every time I come in
with a load of hides...

242
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,033
I'll come and be with you.

243
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:04,409
You know what?
You're not letting me discuss it with you.

244
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:08,044
I decided. We're leaving Monday.

245
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,553
Oh, Jonas.

246
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,323
We don't have to just go
packing out of here like beggars...

247
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,885
just because things
are a little unsteady right now.

248
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,624
There's time.

249
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,429
- No, I ain't waiting.
- There's time.

250
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:31,569
Dub says a man'll wear out or rust out.
And it ain't my bend to rust.

251
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,636
- I think you meant to say, "isn't<i>."</i>
- Damn it, I said what I meant.

252
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:43,477
But, Jonas, I can't leave Aunt Gussie.
Don't you see?

253
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:49,520
She's taken care of me all these years.
She's been heartbroken too many times.

254
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:53,359
She's hurt now.
She doesn't understand about us.

255
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,434
We can wait. We have to.

256
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:00,494
Somebody else can take care of her.
She can afford it.

257
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,129
Well, it's not the same.

258
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,832
Well, maybe not, Jessie,
but you think about us.

259
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:09,175
Don't think about her all the time
with that pity begging look she puts on.

260
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,842
Good lord, Jonas, stop blaming her.
She wasn't always this way.

261
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:16,943
She's sick now,
and she doesn't understand about us.

262
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:21,150
- I've had to lie to her.
- Well, Aunt Gussie, hell.

263
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,059
Everything for Aunt Gussie
and this damn house.

264
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,055
Well, this is a big house...

265
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,622
but you hear me, Jessie,
it's a heap bigger world outside.

266
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:34,001
Oh, you! You just never see anything
about my Aunt Gussie, do you? Do you?

267
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,536
You want to know why she's the way she is?

268
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,041
Why she changed her mind
and gave us the wedding?

269
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,238
Well, I'll just tell you, Mr. Trapp,
I'll just shout it at you.

270
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:46,681
It's because of what I did to her.
I told her we had to get married.

271
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,017
You told her that<i>...</i>

272
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,254
Well, Jonas...

273
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,053
see it how it was.

274
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:58,824
I love you.

275
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,832
- I had to have you. There was no other way.
- I reckon not.

276
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,697
Jonas, I had to.

277
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,073
I told her that we<i>...</i>

278
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,235
Down at the crick, we<i>...</i>

279
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,838
I had to. Can't you see?

280
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,545
I see, all right.

281
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,086
Why, I almost killed my Aunt Gussie<i>...</i>

282
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,353
No, I mean<i>...</i>

283
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,893
Now, pretty soon she's going to see.

284
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:40,234
Well, pretty soon she's going to know
I've lied to her.

285
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,409
And then maybe she'll like you better and<i>...</i>

286
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,240
I see what I am to you...

287
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,971
and to your Aunt Gussie.

288
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,472
To this town.

289
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,446
I know my place.

290
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:01,388
- Are you coming to Kansas, Jessie?
- I can't.

291
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,754
Yeah, I guess you know your place, too.

292
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,989
Jessie.

293
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:04,144
Easy does it, big hoss. You ain't dead yet.
You was sent for, but you didn't go.

294
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:07,157
Now this here's a poultice. Mostly lard.

295
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,221
Now easy, easy does it, big hoss.

296
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,195
Might just keep mortification
from setting in.

297
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:20,032
- Who in the hell are you?
- Nobody much.

298
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:24,065
Name's Hanley.
I got me a shack up in them hills.

299
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,202
My, this Jessie woman,
must be some heap of girl.

300
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,842
This Jessie you been moaning about.

301
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,517
Aye, my<i>...</i>

302
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:38,519
They must have laid that iron to you
a half a dozen times.

303
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,349
You poor cooked hoss.
Just take it easy now.

304
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,552
You ought to stay easy, son.

305
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:44,279
Hey, hoss, that there is mine!
Why y'all getting into my stuff?

306
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,323
Them there's my belongings.

307
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,503
Hey, you gone <i>loco,</i> big hoss?

308
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,633
Eleven years<i>...</i>

309
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:09,744
Eleven freezing, grubbing...

310
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,311
fly-bitten...

311
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,951
butchering years.

312
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,822
All that was in them saddlebags?

313
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,559
A buffalo man, ain't you?
I mean, a hunter by trade?

314
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,059
I was.

315
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,232
Here, eat.

316
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,894
All right, suit yourself.

317
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,437
I'm telling you, a man ought to eat,
every chance he gets.

318
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:20,708
Hey, you. You know who done that to you?

319
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:24,054
I know. By God, I know the three of them.

320
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:29,025
Well, now, you take my advice, big hoss.
You take it easy, or you'll go to festering.

321
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,729
I am festering. Inside.

322
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,200
Thanks.

323
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,123
- Jessie.
- Whoa! Don't touch me!

324
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:25,601
You get away from me, you filthy, smelly<i>...</i>
Get away!

325
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,704
I seen him, honey,
and I ran as fast as I could.

326
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,715
Oh, my God, Mrs. Lavender.

327
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,076
That awful man.

328
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,722
I'm going home before they all come out
and look at me.

329
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,452
Straightaway, honey.

330
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,462
Now, you're all snug and safe.

331
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:03,637
- Where's the brandy? You need it.
- It's over there in the cupboard.

332
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,734
Filthy rag of a man.

333
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,404
Smelled awful.

334
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,847
Smelled like he had the rot or something.

335
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,440
God love you, child, that's awful.
Did he hurt you?

336
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,611
No.

337
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,952
Oh, well, it's not the first time.

338
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,316
Johnsy Hood stopped me once,
and he tried to<i>...</i>

339
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,258
Did you tell Brooks?

340
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,027
No, I didn't want to cause any trouble.

341
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,161
You ain't the only one's been molested.

342
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:36,604
Some time back, I was in the john,
and a drunken cowboy...

343
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,973
threw his rope around the entire privy
and started dragging.

344
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:43,775
- I heard about that.
- You did? I guess everybody has.

345
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,384
Nobody gives a hoot
about us business women.

346
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,886
What we need is our own men folk.

347
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,159
You know, Mrs. Lavender,
Brooks Durham asked me to marry him.

348
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,024
He did? What'd you say? Did you say yes?

349
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,062
No, not yet.

350
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:03,622
You grab him, child.
Grab him any old place you can get him.

351
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:09,731
I'm not sure.
I love Brooks, but there's my husband.

352
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,700
Oh, him. What's his name? Jonas?
How long's he been dead?

353
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,509
I'm not sure that he is,
but he's been gone 11 years.

354
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,914
Then he's dead, buried, legal.

355
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:26,150
Anyway, there's the money that Brooks
loaned me for the house, and the shop.

356
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,925
Now, if I was to marry him, you know
what people would say. They'd say...

357
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,189
The good ones would say, "Hurray<i>."</i>

358
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:36,198
Well, I'd better get back to my bread.

359
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,427
Tell him you'll marry him. Tell him tonight.

360
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,166
Good night, Jessie.

361
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,585
Whiskey.

362
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,521
A bottle.

363
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,122
$2.

364
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,627
My tongue's growed hair on it.

365
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,533
Well, that's $2.

366
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:22,604
I'll bring you the money by, in a day or two.

367
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,279
Here it's cash money.

368
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,448
Look, you.

369
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:31,082
See that man over yonder?
Now, that there's Mr. Kratz.

370
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,419
Keeps the deals right around here.

371
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,919
You can hand over, else I call him.

372
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:45,998
You call your Mr. Kratz,
and we'll see if his rind is made of iron.

373
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,577
So, Mr. Iron Man?

374
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:02,349
- Sometimes...
- Now, I need this!

375
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,282
I'm going out that door...

376
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,656
and maybe I need to kill somebody tonight.

377
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,027
Sometimes I make an exception.

378
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,800
Furry cat!

379
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,239
Come on, kitty.

380
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,751
Kitty? Here, kitty.

381
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,182
Come on, kitty.

382
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,695
Well, okay, I guess you're all right.

383
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,028
But look, next time,
don't get on my clothes...

384
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,433
because that coat
is worth a lot more than your hide.

385
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,436
Who're you talking to, Johnsy?

386
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,909
Never mind.

387
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:06,774
- Will you be gone long, <i>querido?</i>
- No longer than I have to.

388
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:10,047
You think I like her fat, scratchy hands
pawing all over me?

389
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,521
- I know.
- No, you don't know!

390
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:16,249
She has pores like a pig, and she sweats...

391
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:20,761
and she thinks we're playing
Romeo and Juliet.

392
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:25,635
- Who?
- Never mind. Hand me the coat.

393
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,969
There will be much money, Johnsy.

394
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,045
Plenty. $5,000 tomorrow.

395
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,551
Long before her
bent-over old husband gets back.

396
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,612
But, by that time, we'll be well on our way.

397
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:53,955
- Enough for a ring for Maria?
- Yeah, sure.

398
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,323
Before we leave.

399
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,760
Well, what's the difference?
You'll get it in San Francisco.

400
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:05,298
No, Johnsy, my heart, you promised Maria.
You promised.

401
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:09,405
A ring with green lights inside,
like I told my mother.

402
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,781
She must see the ring on my finger
before we leave.

403
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,249
All right.

404
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,652
But I don't have the money yet.

405
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,821
Tomorrow.

406
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,341
Can't you remember that my ribs hurt?

407
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:43,607
Now I told you 40 times
that a horse kicked me.

408
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,773
Sorry, <i>querido.</i>

409
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,684
All right.

410
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,490
All right.

411
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,729
Johnsy!

412
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,514
Brooks!

413
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,986
I just thought I'd be sociable
and walk with you aways.

414
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,719
I had enough of your society last night.

415
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,421
Don't be like that. I may be a big depositor
in your bank some day.

416
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,055
Then you can see me
during business hours.

417
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,098
Hey, <i>senor</i> Johnsy.

418
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,270
- Did you curry him?
<i>- Si.</i>

419
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,408
I myself, I brushed him down this afternoon.

420
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:16,801
<i>- Senor,</i> you need help.
- No, never mind about that.

421
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,701
I want to ask you about somebody.

422
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,574
Mrs. Shelley?

423
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,750
- Anything you'd like me to do tonight?
- No.

424
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:38,784
Nothing, Tod.

425
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:45,325
You can turn in.
I think I'll go for a little walk.

426
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:46,896
It...

427
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,073
sure is a nice night.

428
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:53,668
Yep.

429
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,674
Good night, Mrs. Shelley.

430
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,633
Oh, Johnsy.

431
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,942
- What's wrong, Bonnie?
- It's Track!

432
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,210
- Good God, he's not home?
- No.

433
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:40,480
But this letter came today.
He got somebody to write it.

434
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,957
He'll be here in three weeks.

435
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:48,294
- Well, that's a lot sooner...
- Bonnie, nothing's changed.

436
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:52,332
Now look, you go to the bank tomorrow
before it closes...

437
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,967
and you tell Brooks
you want to withdraw the $5,000.

438
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,136
- But what if...
- Honey, look, it's a joint account.

439
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,673
Now you just say you got this letter...

440
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,239
and you need the money for Track
'cause he's making an investment.

441
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:11,515
Now, I'll be here tomorrow night,
at the same time, to pick the money up.

442
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:16,926
And then you take off for St. Louis,
and I'll meet you there in two weeks.

443
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:19,859
I'm sick with thinking of it.

444
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:24,894
- Suppose Track...
- Track is a burnt out old man.

445
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,937
- He's 70 years old.
- He's 62!

446
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,562
All right, 62.

447
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,074
But, Bonnie,
he never was a husband to you.

448
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,372
- You said that.
- Please, Johnsy.

449
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,440
Bonnie, you told me, you told me yourself.

450
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:45,045
You said you needed a man,
one who could love you half to death.

451
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,920
I know. I know it's you I love!

452
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,955
Haul them horses in.

453
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,724
- What is this?
- Down.

454
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:31,723
Look, mister, I've only got
a dab of cash on me, but<i>...</i>

455
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,733
Down, Johnsy Boy.

456
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,836
And fast.

457
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:19,338
Well, you're just full of
all sort of games, ain't you?

458
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:23,480
Now...

459
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:27,553
down.

460
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:31,558
If it's the horses and rig you want,
you take them.

461
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:37,995
No, Johnsy Boy, that ain't what I want.

462
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,765
I want what's mine.

463
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,733
- Get down.
- Yes, sir.

464
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,745
You call me by name.

465
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,844
I ain't never seen you before.

466
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,045
You ain't, huh, pretty thing?

467
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,190
Well, maybe you've seen this before.

468
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:08,559
You seen that before, Johnsy Boy?

469
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:18,030
- Look, I'll tell you what happened.
- Yes.

470
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,136
Yes, you will tell me what happened.

471
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:25,137
- Now, walk, over there.
- Please.

472
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,145
Please.

473
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:33,648
Walk, posy water,
or else get yourself blowed clear to hell.

474
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,089
I don't think I can.

475
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,494
My legs<i>...</i>

476
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:42,295
"My legs!"

477
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:45,567
All right!

478
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,736
God, man, don't kill me, please!

479
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:58,112
God, man, don't kill me.

480
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:03,015
I'll tell you. True, on my mother's grave.

481
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:08,019
It wasn't me. It wasn't me, sir, it was Coates.

482
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:12,655
Elwood Coates and Brook Durham.
He was the other one.

483
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:16,928
And you see,
they got together to play cards...

484
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,197
and me, I just joined them, to play cards.

485
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:24,104
Well, Durham,
he wouldn't play in town because...

486
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,438
well, his being a banker and all.

487
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,274
And then we find you.

488
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,815
They're talking about hanging. Hanging!

489
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:38,981
And me, I'm against it.
I'm completely against it, I was.

490
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,485
Hell, I told them, I'd take a calf, too...

491
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,825
was I hungry, and one come along.

492
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:50,062
But Coates and Durham...

493
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:54,568
they thought up this thing...

494
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,733
about the iron.

495
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,037
And I was against that, too, but...

496
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,476
- they'd have got a rope.
- All right, stop here.

497
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,641
See, if I hadn't gone with them.

498
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,915
I knew you'd see it, sir.

499
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,388
Coates.

500
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:22,323
Coates! Hell, he's a crazy man.

501
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,766
He's drunk crazy. He talks to himself.

502
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,532
He talks to himself.

503
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:33,707
He's just a mean, crazy drunk.

504
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,887
I don't blame you, mister.

505
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:49,452
I don't blame you for hitting me, but<i>...</i>
No! Please!

506
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,692
You're getting my clothes all dirty.

507
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,930
What are you going to do?

508
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:03,297
I'm going to put a mark on you, beauty.

509
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,371
No!

510
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,476
No, you can't burn me!

511
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:13,045
Coates! Durham! It was their fault!

512
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,750
I couldn't help it.
I just went along to play cards.

513
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:21,883
Damn you, you fancy plaything.
You look at me, and you tell me straight.

514
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,821
I can't.

515
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,153
- What went with my money?
- Money?

516
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,428
I swear to God,
I don't know about any money!

517
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:35,265
Please, don't do it! I don't know!

518
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,405
When you brand, it's usual to earmark...

519
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,309
and geld.

520
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,273
Now...

521
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:48,418
what went with my $17,000?

522
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:52,016
I never seen it. I don't know. Don't<i>...</i>

523
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,657
Last time, Johnsy Boy.

524
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,487
Where is my $17,000?

525
00:49:58,528 --> 00:49:59,927
No.

526
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,696
No.

527
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,632
No. Please.

528
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,373
Please!

529
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,443
No, don't! Don't hurt me!

530
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,345
Don't do it. Please.

531
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,287
Please.

532
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:32,317
Yes, do it!

533
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,390
Do it!

534
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,629
Turn it loose, man!
Good god, man, turn it loose!

535
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:42,862
Turn it loose!

536
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:57,180
But, Jessie, dear, I hope you don't believe
in long engagements.

537
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:02,084
- Anytime you say, Brooks.
- It's not too late to get the reverend tonight.

538
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,890
We can't do that.
We've got to wait at least a month.

539
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:11,093
- Why?
- Because there's plans, arrangements.

540
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,600
What will I do with the shop?

541
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,363
- Get rid of it, give it away.
- Oh, Brooks.

542
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,167
Jessie, you're marrying
a very successful man.

543
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,231
- I know I am, but I can't do that.
- All right, all right.

544
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,900
One month from today.

545
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,932
Who are you? What are you doing here?

546
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,071
I used to live here.

547
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:53,936
Jonas.

548
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,071
Jonas, I thought you was dead.

549
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:00,048
Did you mourn much, Dub?

550
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,976
Drink a little less whiskey, maybe.
Or a little more?

551
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,721
Son, what happened?

552
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,086
Son?

553
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:16,063
I figure I owe you for a shave, Dub.
About two bits is all.

554
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,658
I'll pay you before I leave these parts.

555
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:24,130
Does Jessie know? Have you seen Jessie?

556
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,244
I seen Jessie this morning, Brooks.
Congratulations!

557
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,574
Thank you, Mrs. Lavender.

558
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:34,139
- I was for you all along!
- Thank you, Mrs. Lavender.

559
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:45,293
- Congratulations, sir.
- Best of luck.

560
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:48,126
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Whiskey for everybody.

561
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,996
Congratulations, Mr. Durham.
News is all over town.

562
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,262
Thanks to Mrs. Lavender, no doubt.

563
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,439
We got our own bottle,
ain't we, Whiskey Man?

564
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,642
We don't need
none of Brooks Durham's wedding whiskey.

565
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,892
Get that horse out of here.
This ain't no stable!

566
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:21,563
Man, give me a drink, quick. Come on, now!

567
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,856
Blast your damp ears, boy,
what's eating you?

568
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:26,026
Come on now get away,
give me some room, will you?

569
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:29,037
- All right, calm down.
- Give me some whiskey. I want whiskey.

570
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,970
Give that boy some whiskey!

571
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,872
What happened, Tod?

572
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,375
Johnsy Boy Hood.

573
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,552
Every night now
since old man Shelley's been away, I just<i>...</i>

574
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:45,246
I seen Johnsy's rig out in the cottonwoods.

575
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,755
Last night he come back about midnight.

576
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,492
And his hands<i>...</i>

577
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,895
His hands was burnt awful.

578
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,033
Lord Almighty, and his belly<i>...</i>

579
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,226
His belly clean through his clothes<i>...</i>

580
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:05,072
Somebody had done it with a branding iron.

581
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:10,168
Hear that, Whiskey Man? Hear what
that big buffler did to Johnsy Boy?

582
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,674
And he was laughing.
That's right, he was laughing like a loony.

583
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:21,254
Laughing and swearing that he didn't take
this $17,000 from some buffalo hunter.

584
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:24,554
And me and Mrs. Shelley,
we took him inside and she got him...

585
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:27,688
a basin of water,
but Johnsy Boy didn't want no water.

586
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,254
He batted it away from her...

587
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:32,392
and he commenced to calling Mrs. Shelley
all kinds of names...

588
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,903
and then she took it up
and they was going back and forth.

589
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:39,806
Damn near had a fit! They're talking about
San Francisco and $5,000, St. Louis...

590
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:43,072
and how he was seeing a gal named Maria.

591
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:47,911
Then he give her a hit
and knocked me away...

592
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:50,851
and then next thing I knew...

593
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,356
he's in front of the looking glass...

594
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,425
gawking at his self and crying...

595
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:03,588
saying he didn't take no $17,000.

596
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,197
And in his hand he's got this gun...

597
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,768
pointing it at his self...

598
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:19,547
off it goes.

599
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,177
Bam.

600
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,615
There's $17,000, Whiskey Man.
Where's our share?

601
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:30,155
You ever seen a man's guts hanging out?

602
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:32,956
They look like...

603
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,464
crawling blue snakes.

604
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:41,795
- Here, have another one!
- You damn bet you!

605
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:02,313
- Is he crippled?
- No. Just lost a shoe.

606
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:05,852
Man ought to feed a horse.
Even this kind. He's old.

607
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,022
$20.

608
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,825
- Saddle, too.
- $40.

609
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:17,265
- You want the Winchester?
- Look, man, I ain't no pawn shop.

610
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:21,168
- Are you throwing in the bridle?
- I will.

611
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,235
$100 for the whole lot.

612
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,702
What's his name?

613
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:56,637
No name. Just "horse<i>."</i>

614
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:20,569
Just found out a few minutes ago
I got a vacancy.

615
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,132
Old Johnsy Boy Hood.

616
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:26,167
- Can you wait while I clean out his room?
- Yep.

617
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,470
Oh, boy!

618
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:30,102
Somebody sure caught Johnsy Boy
somewheres...

619
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:34,480
branded him square in the middle.
Ain't seen his body, but Tod Wisdom said...

620
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,417
- He dead?
- Sure, mighty right he's dead.

621
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:40,815
Shot his self
right in Mrs. Shelley's bedroom.

622
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:43,416
- Say, mister?
- Yeah.

623
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:46,951
Can you send somebody out
for a box of.44 shells?

624
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,759
- Sure.
- Thank you.

625
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:51,690
And maybe a shirt? Buckskin shirt?

626
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:00,667
And I'll be needing a hot tub bath.

627
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:02,871
Yeah.

628
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,551
Hey, Tod. Tod, hey!

629
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,953
Is that all Johnsy Boy said
about that $17,000?

630
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:15,790
Yeah, he...

631
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,119
said he didn't have it.

632
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,288
We know who does, don't we, Whiskey Man?

633
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,798
We gonna go fetch it, come on.

634
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,648
Hanley! You in there, Hanley?

635
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,913
Damn it all,
don't go ripping through that orchard!

636
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,420
Can't you see
I got me some peppers planted?

637
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,218
Peppers. How about that!

638
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:51,885
- You sure do raise one hell of a fuss.
- I'm in a hell of a hurry.

639
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:55,260
You know, you could kill a pony that way.
Ain't you noticed the heat?

640
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,833
Never you mind. You got any cows penned?

641
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:00,893
- A few. About seven head.
- Shoo them out.

642
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:04,869
- Do what?
- Turn them out. We're quitting.

643
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:09,002
Old man Chester's been nosing
over his tally count too close.

644
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:12,411
Worse than before,
after what happened at the Little Dirty.

645
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:15,242
Coates, you ride a fat horse half to death...

646
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:17,444
to come out here to tell me
I'm out of business?

647
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,752
- I come out for my money.
- Money?

648
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:27,955
Hell, Elwood, we're all square. I split up
every last cent I got from them cows.

649
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:31,761
Cows? I'm talking about money,
you old crud!

650
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:34,228
My share of that $17,000.

651
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:38,139
- You're babbling drunk.
- Suffering hell, yes.

652
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:42,904
And I'm after my share, partner,
of what you took from that big buffler.

653
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,637
Skunk drunk that night, too, weren't you?

654
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:50,083
- My, you sure did for that poor devil.
- Ain't it some pity?

655
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,481
Now what about the money?

656
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,217
I didn't take to
what you did to that poor man.

657
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:59,421
I was laying up in the brush and seen it all.
Hell, you knowed whose iron that was.

658
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,895
It ought to have been you!
Making a fire in sight of the trail.

659
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:05,160
You caused the whole gutting mess!

660
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,800
Well, you know me,
I could've easy shot down all three of you.

661
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:10,830
I studied on it, too...

662
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,431
you putting my iron
to that human man that way.

663
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:16,410
Yeah, and you could have
stopped the whole thing.

664
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:20,909
But you didn't, you yellow crud,
and now the fat's in the fire!

665
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,611
I seen him, bub, I seen him afterwards...

666
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:25,812
and I sure wouldn't want
to be in your boots.

667
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,651
No, sir. He's the kind that<i>...</i>

668
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:30,783
Well was I you, Elwood,
I'd get damned seldom in a hurry.

669
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,852
Hurrying? That's what we're doing.
Where's the money?

670
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,523
- Myself, I didn't get no money.
- Yeah?

671
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,262
You don't mind if we take a look-see inside?

672
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:45,299
- Now why do that, Elwood? I just told you!
- You don't mind if we take a look anyway?

673
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:48,833
Well, now, well maybe I do mind,
'less you put it some better way.

674
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,536
You got it hidden yonder.

675
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,478
You crazy drunk bastard,
you leave me alone.

676
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:55,312
Get out of here
and keep the hell out of my pepper patch!

677
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:00,451
Lying woman-haired old crud!

678
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:03,484
Now we're gonna get that money,
Whiskey Man.

679
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:06,126
We won't have to share it with nobody.

680
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,680
Yeah, Whiskey Man.

681
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,981
Old Simon-pure, pious Brooks Durham.

682
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:33,184
Man of mercy and goodness.

683
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,558
Everything all right? Did that shirt<i>...</i>

684
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:42,324
Sounds like a woman sick upstairs.
You might want to see about it.

685
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:46,858
Well, it's Johnsy's Mex girl.
Ain't let up squalling since I told her.

686
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:50,698
- She'll be moving along.
- You putting her out?

687
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:54,365
- Happens this is Saturday, rent day and...
- How much?

688
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:59,740
- Her rent. How much?
- Well, for her $5 the week.

689
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:03,341
- We don't cater to that type.
- Have I got some change coming?

690
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,114
- Yeah.
- Use it for her rent, huh?

691
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:15,223
Mister, you know anybody by the name
of Coates or Brooks Durham?

692
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:19,095
Sure. In one breath you just named
the town's sorriest and best.

693
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:20,462
Whereabouts?

694
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,939
Well, Coates is foreman of Circle "C,"
he'll be at the saloon sooner than later.

695
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,303
Brooks Durham?

696
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,310
Runs a bank.
I expect he'll be at it right now.

697
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:33,105
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

698
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,640
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Why don't you...

699
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,071
Jessie.

700
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:04,974
Oh, no!

701
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,310
You.

702
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,853
That was you last night. I<i>...</i>

703
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:15,449
The filthy, smelly tramp.

704
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,821
Jonas.

705
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:21,796
My God.

706
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,361
- Oh, my God.
- Jessie, stop it.

707
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,471
Why? Why did you,
for God's sakes, Jonas, why?

708
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:33,134
I didn't mean to scare you.
Thought you'd know me day or night.

709
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:41,480
I didn't mean that.
I meant, why did you come back?

710
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:47,883
Goodbye, Jessie.

711
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,156
Wait.

712
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:58,959
Wait, damn you! It's not that easy.

713
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:01,129
We have to talk.

714
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:05,399
- No reason to talk.
- Well, then you just listen.

715
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:12,737
Come into the shop.

716
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:33,530
Lord, Jessie. It's after 10:00.

717
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:36,402
Well, I'm not going to open until<i>...</i>

718
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:39,840
Till 11:00.

719
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:42,174
Oh, Great Hannah!

720
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,241
Shut the door.

721
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:00,623
I thought you were dead.

722
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:06,198
There was a story...

723
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:11,767
- they said somebody at Dodge, and...
- Clay Allison? He had poor ammunition.

724
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:20,876
You look pretty.

725
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,142
You look butchered.

726
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:26,153
But I just rose up from hell
with my hair on fire.

727
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,881
I ain't staying long.

728
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:31,757
Then why did you come back at all?
For me to kiss your filthy sores?

729
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:34,557
I was coming back to make it up, Jessie.

730
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:38,225
- I wasn't like this. I had money.
- Oh, money?

731
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,063
- I'm sorry, Jessie.
- You're sorry?

732
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,574
Don't you care to hear
how it's been for me, Mr. Sorry?

733
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:48,576
How I lived while you were off
with your guns and your stinking buffalo?

734
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:49,770
Jessie, what good...

735
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,779
Do you know that
Aunt Gussie wasn't shamming?

736
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:55,613
She died the month after you left
and took your precious pride with you.

737
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:58,085
She owed everybody in town,
even for the wedding.

738
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,351
The money had run out, Jonas.
I mortgaged the house to the rooftop...

739
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,620
and I've been trying
to scratch out a living in this shop.

740
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,287
- Well, this ain't getting nowhere...
- Well, where would you like us to get?

741
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:18,763
For all you knew, I could have ended up
in the back room of some saloon.

742
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:20,331
I started to have a letter wrote...

743
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:23,378
Well, what stopped you then?
Your pride or your love of the buffaloes?

744
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:27,381
Or maybe you had somebody else, Jonas,
somebody better suited to you!

745
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:30,117
- Nobody else.
- Well, I have!

746
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:34,684
So go on now. Go on and murder
your buffalo. That's what I want you to do.

747
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:37,657
I've got somebody else now.
Somebody better suited to me.

748
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:40,195
- Who, Jessie?
- What difference does it make to you?

749
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:43,163
- Just get out. I'm getting married.
- Tell me.

750
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:46,030
I am through being a widow. It's my right.

751
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,332
You're dead, Jonas.

752
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:50,395
You are dead!

753
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,467
- Am I?
- Yes.

754
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:17,995
Am I dead, Jessie?

755
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,829
Yes!

756
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:29,373
I want to marry<i>...</i>

757
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:33,715
I want to marry Brooks just as soon as I can.

758
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:37,715
- Brooks?
- Brooks Durham.

759
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,087
He's everything that you're not
and can't be!

760
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:45,718
- Brooks Durham?
- You leave him alone! I love him.

761
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:58,806
Something I don't abide.
Seems you got them joshing about me.

762
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:03,607
You owe the Bulls $2. Pay now.

763
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:06,912
You picked a no-good time.

764
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,750
I dislike killing a man for $2,
but kill you I will.

765
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:15,320
Well, you're too late, mister,
because I'm already dead!

766
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,422
Dead!

767
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,403
Jonas. Now cool off.

768
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,006
Get off the street and think things over.
Before somebody gets killed.

769
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:42,678
Go on!

770
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,346
Who is it?

771
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:18,448
Better get the women and kids out of here.
This ain't pretty.

772
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,349
Can you tell who it is?

773
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:24,051
You can't tell it from looking,
but I know who it is or was.

774
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:27,218
I sold that sorrel to Lee Hanley
a short time back.

775
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:31,961
Hanley? Yeah, I guess it could be.

776
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,864
In heaven's name,
can't someone cut him loose?

777
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:39,273
- Yeah, come on, let's unhitch him.
- When it rains, it sure does pour.

778
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,783
Howdy, partner.

779
01:09:57,226 --> 01:10:01,026
- What do you want here, Coates?
- Stud, when you getting out?

780
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:05,060
- Say what you mean. I've no time for riddles.
- Trailing, that's what I, by God, mean.

781
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:09,228
Before that buffalo-stink catches up to us
the way he done to Johnsy Boy.

782
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:11,836
I come by for my traveling money.

783
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:14,870
- You've got no money here.
- You're wrong.

784
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:18,241
I got my share of that $17,000
you took off that horse.

785
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:21,510
- Damn you, Coates!
- Hold on, I been figuring.

786
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:26,554
Now Johnsy Boy, he didn't get it.
Me, I didn't get it. Hanley, he didn't get it...

787
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:28,347
- Hanley?
- So<i>...</i>

788
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:34,519
- What has he got to do with this?
- Well, nothing now.

789
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:38,423
- You killed him.
- Well, I didn't mean to.

790
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:41,401
- Was Hanley out at the creek that night?
- Sure, that was his fire.

791
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:44,836
Him and me's been gathering a few
of old man Chester's steers on the side.

792
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:48,399
Coates, you are not human, you are filth.
Branding that man when you knew he...

793
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,876
Now there wasn't no choice.
I had to make a showing.

794
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:54,712
You and me wasn't partners then.
I figured you a good witness.

795
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:58,583
I didn't know that stinking tramp was
gonna come chasing after us.

796
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:02,180
Coates, there was a time
when I didn't keep this locked in a drawer...

797
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,885
it was lashed to my leg.

798
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:06,894
And I used it on better men than you.
Now get out.

799
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,927
All right for now, Reverend.

800
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:18,869
But don't you think that big buffler-stink
is gonna leave town chasing me.

801
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:24,068
It ain't me that's got his money
or is messing with his wife.

802
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:26,881
- His wife?
- Yeah, Miss Jessie.

803
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:32,980
- How does that set with you?
- You're a lying. He's dead.

804
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:36,251
Don't you just wish.
I seen him coming out of her house.

805
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:38,418
You wasn't in these parts
in them days, but I was.

806
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,587
I recollect old Dub Stokes' boy,
big as a bull.

807
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:42,062
I said, get out.

808
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:51,067
Now part of that money is mine,
and the woman's his.

809
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,837
It's like a friend of mine once said:

810
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:58,140
"I wouldn't care
to stand in your boots, bub<i>."</i>

811
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,546
You are the one?

812
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,546
The one what?

813
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:45,388
The one who has paid for Maria,
for her room. Why?

814
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:50,397
Here is why.

815
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:55,034
You think I am a hotel woman
and I must pay you.

816
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:57,305
Fix your dress.

817
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,903
<i>Aqui!</i> It is the pay you thought for,
is it not?

818
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,179
Cover yourself up.

819
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:09,848
Then why?

820
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:14,818
You knew my Johnsy?

821
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,362
- You were friends?
- No.

822
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:28,031
You got somebody? Family?

823
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:32,599
<i>- Si.</i> My mother and sisters.
- In Coldiron?

824
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:36,433
- Go to them.
- No.

825
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:40,682
I promised I would not go back
without a ring.

826
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:46,343
A ring with green lights.

827
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:54,792
- You smoke?
- Only a little.

828
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:57,258
When I'm hungry.

829
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,364
When have you ate?

830
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:03,928
I had some goat's milk and panocha
from the street yesterday.

831
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:09,470
Here, come here.

832
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,582
Get yourself something today.

833
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:20,986
- And you, <i>Senor?</i>
- I'm not hungry. Thirsty.

834
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,318
- He belong to you?
- Was Johnsy's.

835
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,753
You want me to get rid of him?

836
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:31,425
Leave him. He ain't hurt nothing.
He's just a cat.

837
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,764
Thank you, <i>Senor.</i>

838
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:40,269
Kitty, kitty. Here, cat.

839
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:44,302
Come here, cat. Come here.

840
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:59,316
- Who is it?
- It's me, son. It's Dub.

841
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:03,992
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you, son.

842
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,629
Did you bring a rifle to talk with?

843
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:12,868
I had to put on that show out there
or somebody might have killed you, son.

844
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,535
Will you quit calling me "son"?

845
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:18,706
Still stubborn as Bernard's mule?

846
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:23,446
Look, boy, I just came
from talking with Jessie.

847
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:25,109
She's in an uproar.

848
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,886
She says she told you something
she hadn't ought to.

849
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:30,117
She's afraid you'll do something about it.

850
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,217
You mean about Brooks Durham?

851
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:36,964
It ain't only Jessie. You got the whole town
jiggling in its boots.

852
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:39,894
I ain't guilty of nothing, yet.

853
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:44,701
Many years as I can remember
this has always been a quiet kind of town.

854
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:47,741
You come back
and blow that quiet all to blazes.

855
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:51,176
Kratz, Hanley, Johnsy Boy.

856
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,848
Ain't you guilty?

857
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:56,480
Somebody busted into
the blacksmith's shop last night...

858
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,315
and made off with a branding iron.

859
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,378
- Maybe you ain't guilty of that?
- Maybe.

860
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:03,049
Any more trouble around here
and that council of Durham's...

861
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:06,525
is gonna slap on some taxes
and hire us some law.

862
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:09,686
Well, there's a lot of us around here
ain't geared to taxes.

863
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:13,030
Dub, you telling me nice-like to clear out?

864
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:14,932
Look, Jonas,
there's a committee meeting tonight.

865
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,095
A lynch talk?

866
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:19,435
I'd like to tell them you're gonna
pay your respects to your family's grave...

867
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:22,339
and my Helena's early in the morning,
and then be gone.

868
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:25,938
So my wife can marry Brooks Durham?
Huh, Dub?

869
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,876
You being the way you are.

870
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:32,619
You know how I got this way?

871
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:35,950
Why, she'd be better off with him.

872
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:39,617
Well, look, boy, I know you're afoot.

873
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:44,521
I'll buy you back your horse and your gear,
and I'll have them here in the morning.

874
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,196
Yeah, Dub, I guess you kind of do
owe me at least a horse, don't you?

875
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:51,896
That's sense, boy.

876
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:00,873
I'll have that horse here
first thing in the morning.

877
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:03,077
Now you just<i>...</i>

878
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:06,243
You just spend the evening peaceful.

879
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:09,146
I'll spend the evening.

880
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:35,345
If your man come home all busted
and half-butchered, would you<i>...</i>

881
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,649
What would you do?

882
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,453
I think I would kiss him.

883
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:01,835
I would have no money to give him...

884
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:06,840
but I would kiss him many times
and embrace him.

885
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,113
Because he's home.

886
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,848
Home.

887
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:29,300
I don't know, Jessie. I flat don't know.

888
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:34,639
- He won't go?
- I'm telling the committee he will.

889
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:39,178
Committees.

890
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:44,483
- They hang people.
- It's not as likely in broad daylight.

891
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:48,054
- We can keep things quiet tonight.
- It's all right.

892
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:52,223
- I've just got to tell Brooks about him.
- Don't, Jessie.

893
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:55,319
I just don't like the way
he kept saying "Brooks Durham<i>."</i>

894
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:58,127
- Well, what then?
- You keep Brooks with you.

895
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,397
Take him up to the mansion.
Likely Jonas won't go there.

896
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:05,468
I'll stop by the bank and tell Brooks
you want to see him at 8:00.

897
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,065
You keep him there with you,
till you hear from me.

898
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:11,668
But if he knows there's a meeting,
how am I going to keep him with me?

899
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,580
If you love Brooks
and you want Jonas to stay alive...

900
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:16,708
you just keep him there.

901
01:19:18,653 --> 01:19:20,883
Who's going to be at the meeting?

902
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:25,487
Well, they've got some of the hard ones.
Kratz, if he's able.

903
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,860
And the word's out
for that crazy Elwood Coates.

904
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:32,389
Oh, Dub.

905
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,573
Don't let them hurt him.

906
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:43,534
Doesn't look like there's much more
you can do to one like that.

907
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:46,843
- It's all been done before.
- He is your son.

908
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:49,176
Not according to him.

909
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:51,614
Is he still at the hotel?

910
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:56,380
You ain't thinking of seeing him?

911
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:00,784
I don't know.

912
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:04,093
- lf I thought it would help, I<i>...</i>
- Don't, Jessie.

913
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:08,364
He's got a girl with him.

914
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:17,068
I'll go to the bank.

915
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:25,376
Could I get you anything while you wait
for the stagecoach, Mrs. Shelley?

916
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:27,983
A drink of water, maybe?

917
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:33,151
Got dark early.

918
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,766
Summer storm close by.

919
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:42,393
Maybe heading this way.

920
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:58,011
- Are you sure you understand who I mean?
<i>- Si, Senora. El Tigre.</i>

921
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:03,618
The Tiger? That's what they've named him?

922
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:08,293
All right.

923
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,992
You take this to <i>El Tigre.</i>

924
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:02,381
To kill, is that a thirst with you, too?

925
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:13,422
I should have told you something right off
about Johnsy. l...

926
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,264
<i>El Tigre.</i>

927
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:11,708
Sure, Jessie.
Bless you and Brooks Durham, too.

928
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:25,459
This letter, it puts a wrath on you.

929
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:29,768
You will be killed. I know it.

930
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:37,505
You never did get your ring, did you?

931
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:42,999
I didn't have to tell you, Jessie.

932
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,137
Yes, you did, because you knew I'd find out.

933
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:47,374
What you didn't have to do
was steal his money...

934
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:49,382
brand him and turn him into an animal.

935
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:51,384
- I thought he was a thief.
- And what were you?

936
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:53,386
Jessie, I want you to be the first to know...

937
01:24:53,488 --> 01:24:55,718
I'm going to find him
and give him his money back.

938
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:58,019
And what about the brand?
Will you just peel that off?

939
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,185
They were going to hang him.

940
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:02,525
Do you know there's a committee talking
about hanging him right this minute?

941
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:04,428
Then I'll stop them.

942
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,390
Jessie, I love you.

943
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:11,232
I love you more than the bank,
or the money, or the house, or anything.

944
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:12,431
I'll never leave you.

945
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,440
Do you know what I'm thinking,
Brooks Durham?

946
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:17,534
I'm thinking Jonas was right about me
all the time.

947
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:20,706
This house and being a Larkin,
was all I've ever cared about.

948
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:24,240
- He was the one who left you for 11 years.
- Maybe not.

949
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:28,016
- Jessie, I love you. Together we can...
- Together!

950
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:32,287
He's alone out there.
He's wounded, he's gut-mad.

951
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:35,419
Now, he's going to end up killing
somebody, or they'll end up killing him.

952
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:38,294
- I'll find him. I'll give him his money back...
- Money.

953
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:42,096
Money. Why does everything
boil down to money?

954
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:46,934
Do you realize I have seen my husband
twice since he's been home?

955
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:53,270
- And both times I've hit him.
- That's not your fault or mine.

956
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,811
Jessie, I'll do everything I can
to straighten this out.

957
01:25:56,918 --> 01:26:00,649
Just promise me one thing,
that you'll stay here until I get back.

958
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:16,067
Where else would I be, Brooks?

959
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:53,501
Durham!

960
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:57,205
Here we come, Reverend,
the Whiskey Man and me!

961
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:19,329
Here's where you get yours, Reverend!

962
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:41,012
You best all stand back.

963
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:47,521
- You hit, Mr. Durham?
- No.

964
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:51,654
You're Jonas Trapp.

965
01:27:53,034 --> 01:27:54,558
You got a gun?

966
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:59,233
- I want to tell you something.
- Then you're gonna die talking.

967
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:02,804
I want to tell all of you. All of you, listen.

968
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:06,476
We thought this man was a thief. He's not.

969
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:11,174
Johnsy and Coates and me,
we marked him with a branding iron.

970
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:21,561
I took your money.

971
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:26,424
I stole it. And Jessie knows all about it.

972
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:31,403
I'm sorry.

973
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:37,943
Go to hell.

974
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:40,503
Mr. Trapp<i>...</i>

975
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:16,327
Look out!

976
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:34,071
Whiskey Man...

977
01:32:36,651 --> 01:32:38,482
he's killed us both.

978
01:32:57,104 --> 01:32:58,867
There's worse guns.

979
01:33:03,544 --> 01:33:06,206
It'll swap for a ring.

980
01:34:39,774 --> 01:34:41,071
Jonas...

981
01:34:42,943 --> 01:34:44,877
there's no need to leave.

982
01:34:45,746 --> 01:34:47,236
None to stay.

983
01:34:52,553 --> 01:34:55,078
- Your money.
- No.

984
01:34:57,758 --> 01:34:59,453
It belongs to you.

985
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:02,927
It did belong to us.
I don't know who it belongs to now.

986
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:08,067
- Don't you want it?
- No.

987
01:35:09,804 --> 01:35:13,740
- I'm asking you to stay.
- Yesterday you begged me to go.

988
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:17,274
All right, I'll beg.

989
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:25,508
You act as if you don't even remember me.

990
01:35:27,455 --> 01:35:29,252
I remember, Jessie.

991
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:31,480
You and...

992
01:35:32,293 --> 01:35:34,693
me and this place.

993
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:39,094
Where will you go with nothing, nobody?

994
01:35:40,835 --> 01:35:42,496
Here, there.

995
01:35:45,506 --> 01:35:48,600
Where, Jonas, please?

996
01:35:52,179 --> 01:35:54,670
There's still some buffalo to the south.

997
01:35:55,483 --> 01:35:57,951
Not many, but some.

998
01:36:06,227 --> 01:36:07,455
Jonas.

999
01:36:31,652 --> 01:36:33,711
He didn't even look back.

1000
01:36:34,889 --> 01:36:36,151
No. He wouldn't.

1001
01:36:42,196 --> 01:36:44,994
Go after him, child. He came after you.

1002
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:53,633
He doesn't want me.

1003
01:36:54,742 --> 01:36:59,873
No, it's this town.
And what's happened here he doesn't want.

1004
01:37:01,415 --> 01:37:02,905
Go after him.

1005
01:37:30,945 --> 01:37:32,674
- Well?
- Well, what?

1006
01:37:32,746 --> 01:37:37,706
- Did she go after him? Did she find him?
- I don't know. Nobody knows.

1007
01:37:37,785 --> 01:37:39,116
How's that?

1008
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:42,185
She left in a while.

1009
01:37:42,456 --> 01:37:46,290
But neither she nor Jonas Trapp
were ever heard of. Or from.

1010
01:37:46,727 --> 01:37:49,525
She never wrote to Dub or Brooks Durham?

1011
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:51,224
Never.

1012
01:37:56,437 --> 01:37:58,064
How much do I owe you?

1013
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:01,273
A dollar even.

1014
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:16,579
I don't think she ever found him.
And if she did, they didn't stay together.

1015
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:18,381
Why say that?

1016
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:22,791
Well, like the song says...
"You can't ever go home again<i>."</i>

1017
01:38:23,497 --> 01:38:27,456
Well, that's just a song.
And "home" is just a word.
