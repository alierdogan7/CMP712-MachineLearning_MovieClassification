1
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,495
God almighty.

2
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,689
That man's shot to death.

3
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,125
I wonder what he done.

4
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,877
Well, whatever it was,
somebody didn't like it.

5
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,354
That's for sure.

6
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,860
Help me, boys.

7
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,722
Save me.

8
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,074
Hide me.

9
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,876
Don't take too damn long about it,
'cause I'm going fast.

10
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,650
We can get in terrible trouble.

11
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,444
He's right, you know.
It ain't none of our business.

12
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,279
But if we don't do something,
he's bound to die.

13
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,632
That's right, sonny.

14
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,079
I'm on my way to meet my maker.

15
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,601
And I ain't ready for him.

16
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,285
I don't want to touch him.

17
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,280
Is this your farm?

18
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,365
Yes, I own it.

19
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:02,119
Did you see anybody unfamiliar
pass this way yesterday or today?

20
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,892
No, I've seen nobody.

21
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,290
You, boy?

22
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,391
No, sir.

23
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,237
We got a mean one loose.
Watch out for him.

24
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,281
Kindly ride clear of my flower bed.

25
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,579
Watch the geraniums, boys.

26
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,015
One, two, three.
All here and accounted for.

27
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,267
Good evening, boys.

28
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,393
Good evening.

29
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,836
Thank you.

30
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,191
It's nice to see you.

31
00:06:56,291 --> 00:07:01,029
I've been sitting up here all day
staring down that cow's behind till I'm sick.

32
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,302
What's in the pail tonight?

33
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,242
Rabbit.

34
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,686
Hey, that'll slip right down.

35
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,465
Your ma sure knows what to do
with a rabbit.

36
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,425
My ma's dead.

37
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,027
I cooked it.

38
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,953
I got something for you, too.

39
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,417
Why, there must be a couple of dollars
in here.

40
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,405
Did you save it, or did you lift it?

41
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,631
I saved it.

42
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,826
You're gonna need it, mister.

43
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,453
We went through your pockets,
and you ain't got nothing in them.

44
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,499
I got a money belt, boys,
underneath my pants.

45
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,044
With over a $1,000 of gold in them.

46
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,772
You better save this for a rainy day.

47
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,911
I noticed some lace on this bandage.

48
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,806
Who's petticoat did it come off of,

49
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,559
and was the lady still in it
when you took it?

50
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,663
No, them's just curtains from my attic.

51
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,667
Well, what do I owe you boys?

52
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,485
How do you mean?

53
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,947
Food, keep, patchwork, how much?

54
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,720
We didn't figure to charge you, mister.

55
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,243
Well, you could get plenty.

56
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,163
There's a price on my head, boys.

57
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,666
$500 in Texas, $600 in Oklahoma,

58
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,643
and $1,000 in Arkansas.

59
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,070
Who are you, mister?

60
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,008
The name's Spikes, Harry Spikes.

61
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,610
I'm a bank robber, boys.

62
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,805
Bank robber?

63
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,934
That's right, sonny. That's how
I got my ass shot up this time

64
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,251
and 20 times before.

65
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,438
If they caught you, would they hang you?

66
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,790
No.

67
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,070
They'd cut off my head and stick it
on a telegraph pole as a warning.

68
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,697
Like they done to a couple
friends of mine.

69
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,471
Well, then, how come you stick with it?

70
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,556
Well, I got five Mexican ladies
waiting for me in five different towns.

71
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,417
And I got a dozen shirts
all handmade out of pure silk.

72
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,836
Every color of the rainbow.

73
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,110
And the leather in my boots
is as soft as butter.

74
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,720
That's 'cause Indian ladies chew them
before they sew them.

75
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,097
And I got bonded bourbon whiskey

76
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:36,168
and a box of Havana cigars by my bed
every time I lay my head down.

77
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,376
And that's only when things are slack.

78
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,775
But you're sleeping on a hay bale now.

79
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,194
Nothing's perfect.

80
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:50,407
Well, boys, come tomorrow, I'll be gone.

81
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,993
So it's time I made my manners.

82
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,579
You got my eternal
and ever-lasting gratitude.

83
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,125
I know that ain't much in the light
of what you done for me,

84
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,293
but you remember this.

85
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,754
Harry Spike's your man.

86
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,401
I owe you.

87
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,010
Anytime.

88
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,095
Any place.

89
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,822
In any way.

90
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,138
I didn't see your horse stabled.

91
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,098
I didn't put him in tonight.

92
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,309
No, why is that?

93
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,061
I forgot.

94
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,563
Your mind was on other things?

95
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,939
I guess.

96
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,941
That's your responsibility.

97
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,527
If you've finished your supper,
we'll go look for him.

98
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,653
No, I can do it.

99
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,676
We'll go together.

100
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,594
It would seem he's wandered off.

101
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,514
- Did you tether him?
- Yes.

102
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:41,226
Well, maybe he's slipped loose.
Call to him.

103
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,124
Why don't you call?

104
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,361
There's no sign of him.

105
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,030
Is it possible he was stolen?

106
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,366
- I don't know.
- I think you do know.

107
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,845
I'll ask you for a second time.
Where is your horse?

108
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,622
He's mine.

109
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,666
I worked for him. I earned him.

110
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,459
I'm not questioning that.

111
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,212
You work to the limit of your strength,
and you don't complain.

112
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,881
But there are other things
in your character that grieve me.

113
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,717
You disobey. You resist me.
You're not open with me.

114
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,553
Now where's your horse?

115
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,804
I gave him to somebody.

116
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:21,766
Was it that fugitive,
that thief and murderer?

117
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,852
Yes. Yes, I did.

118
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,603
So you lied.

119
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,313
To the posse and to me.

120
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,316
And you stole clothing and food.

121
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,278
Do you understand what you've done?
Do you see yourself as I see you?

122
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,990
Revealed in every sin
of which you're capable.

123
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,076
You've tried my sufferance and God's.

124
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,598
Who comes first, Father?

125
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,144
You just up and left?

126
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,729
That's right.

127
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,923
I took the last licking I can take
without killing him.

128
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,526
You got any back left?

129
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,299
No, he didn't leave much.

130
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,780
What'll you do?

131
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,824
I don't know.
I'll turn up something or other.

132
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,785
You ain't never been
any further than the next town.

133
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,037
The world don't end there.

134
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,980
I suppose it don't.

135
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,543
You know,

136
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,712
I wouldn't mind going with ya.

137
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,486
My daddy's mistook me
for a mule for some time now.

138
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,994
Well, I'll write ya
as soon as I light someplace.

139
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,099
It's gonna be kind
of lonesome around here.

140
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,826
Don't back into any pitchforks.

141
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,211
Don't roll out of bed.

142
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,966
Goodbye.

143
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,826
You mean you're really going for good?

144
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,724
I won't be back this way again.

145
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,334
I wish I was coming.

146
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,857
No, you better not get mixed up in it.

147
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,693
You were gonna teach me
to swim this summer.

148
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,322
Just hold your nose
and jump off the bank.

149
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,823
We've always been together.

150
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,051
It's us.

151
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,779
Well, I can see it's you.
What are you up to?

152
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,473
Why should you have all the fun?

153
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,476
I'd just as soon be
where both of you are at.

154
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,769
Did you bring clean underwear?

155
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,668
No, gonna let this one set ripen.

156
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,651
Okay, we'll do it.
We'll throw in together.

157
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,821
And by God, the one thing we won't
ever do is kiss no man's boot!

158
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,138
You bet!

159
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,616
Let's go get lucky!

160
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,993
Wait a minute. Where are we going?

161
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,437
Hell, I don't know! Anywhere!

162
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,239
What do you want?

163
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,701
We was wondering if we could do you
some chores in exchange for a dollar?

164
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,288
Swill your pigs, clean out your barn,
whatever. You say.

165
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,688
You can scat.
I don't hire saddle tramps.

166
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,043
Ain't you heard, lady?

167
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:45,489
Money's like manure.
It's only good when you spread it around.

168
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,940
There's lunch.

169
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,568
No, I ain't come to that just yet.

170
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,262
You always was a finicky eater, Will.

171
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,794
What you're doing is a terrible sin.

172
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,192
You're eating the body
and the blood of Christ.

173
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:32,033
Tod, tonight this ain't nothing
but crackers and elderberry wine.

174
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,540
Is that gonna be breakfast?

175
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,960
It's breakfast, lunch and supper.

176
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,586
I sure am hungry.

177
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,215
Well, drink some more.
It'll fill you up.

178
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,717
Haven't we got a dime between us?

179
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,071
- No, not a one.
- Money don't even know we're alive.

180
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,558
You could sell your watch.

181
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,102
His daddy give him that watch.

182
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:24,772
Yeah, but it's solid gold.
It'd bring a fistful of money.

183
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,941
Come on, don't you ever want to sit down
in front of a plate again?

184
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,278
Don't you understand nothing?
He don't want to let that go.

185
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,925
Hey, you.

186
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,556
Get up.

187
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,585
You ain't from around here.

188
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,780
I know you ain't, 'cause I know every man,
dog and mule for 50 miles.

189
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,215
That's a wide acquaintance.

190
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,068
You're a pretty funny boy.

191
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,637
Where you from?

192
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,364
Down the road a piece.

193
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,767
"Down the road a piece," huh?

194
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,269
Boys, if there's one thing
that riles my ass,

195
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,520
it's the sight of three high-smelling,

196
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,523
down at the heels egg-suckers
on these quiet streets.

197
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,526
Now what's your business here?
Don't get fresh answering.

198
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,777
We're just passing through.

199
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,987
You sure are.

200
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,055
I reckon five minutes
would be about right.

201
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,450
Five minutes from when?

202
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,894
Five minutes
from the time you got into town.

203
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,648
Well, we might need 10.

204
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,501
My friend here has to use
a public convenience.

205
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,086
Don't sass me, you little bastards.

206
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,484
You ain't calling me that,
mister, are you?

207
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,874
You get going.

208
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,634
Friendly folks around here.

209
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,569
We better move on like he said.

210
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,906
Move where? On what? We're broke.

211
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,075
Mr. Spikes is never broke.

212
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,535
He's never hungry either.

213
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,871
What made you think
of him all of a sudden?

214
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,814
Looking at that bank.

215
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,210
You know what he'd do
if he was in our shoes?

216
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,922
He'd walk in that bank,
pull out his gun, and say,

217
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:16,092
"It's all baloney, so slice me some."

218
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,052
That's stealing!

219
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,280
It's better than starving.

220
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,136
I'm not going to shoot you, mister.
I just want all the money you got in here.

221
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,637
I want it all, and I want it quick.

222
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,015
Everything's in the safe.
Works on a time clock.

223
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,335
- Well, how long before it goes off?
- 9:00.

224
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,023
I'll wait for it.

225
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,151
What's the matter with you?
Have you gone crazy?

226
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,652
- Maybe.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

227
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,320
That sheriff's two steps away.

228
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,989
You two go if you want to,
but I'm staying put.

229
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,032
Let go of it, Will.
This here is deep water.

230
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,226
I'm going whole hog!

231
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:30,233
All right, if you're gonna be in trouble,
I guess I'm gonna be in trouble.

232
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:04,825
It's 9:00, mister.

233
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,036
That clock could be a might fast.

234
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,162
And you could be lying.

235
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:11,499
It's gonna go off any second.
Don't get excited, son.

236
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,792
Any second now.

237
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,543
It better, mister.

238
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,670
There's still time, son.

239
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,340
- For what?
- To think what you're doing.

240
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,926
To think where it will get you.

241
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:25,075
I've set the house on fire.
Let it smoke.

242
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,792
Tod, get behind the door
in case somebody comes in. Les!

243
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,343
I don't even believe it.

244
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,017
Wait. Just take the small ones.
They're safer.

245
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,026
You must be getting tired, mister.
You can put your hands down.

246
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,257
Hey, Bobby Ray, you seen anything
of three young desert rats?

247
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,904
Yeah, I've seen them.

248
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,362
Damnation.

249
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,278
Boy, you gonna have men hunting
you down for this till the day you die.

250
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,348
Stuff you cap in his mouth, Tod.
Shut him up.

251
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,136
Okay, open up.

252
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,059
Open wide.

253
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,101
Now get back. Get Back.

254
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,348
Don't hurry on for us.
We'd like a little jump.

255
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,560
What are you up to?
What are you doing here?

256
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,162
Hey!

257
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,475
They're gonna be on us. Hurry up.

258
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,270
Stop them! Stop them!

259
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,160
Les, Will, I'm down!

260
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,842
- The money!
- Don't stop!

261
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,908
We're all right now.
I think we just crossed the Rio Grande.

262
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,848
I think we're in Mexico.

263
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,058
Look here.

264
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:19,895
A bullet took a lock of hair off me
right behind my ear.

265
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,106
I've got blood on my shirt.

266
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,066
That man fell against you.

267
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,464
Got hold of me around my neck.

268
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:31,073
I never killed nothing in my whole life.
I never even killed a rabbit.

269
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,450
Tod, it was an accident.

270
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,370
That doesn't matter. He's dead!

271
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,599
To God and all of God's world forever.

272
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:48,486
I ought to go back and give myself up.
I'm the one that did it.

273
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:54,197
Well, if we gotta answer,
we'll all answer together.

274
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,807
Maybe we ought to go
join up with the army.

275
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:19,038
The law wouldn't look the other way
just 'cause we come in to join up.

276
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,790
At least they'd feed you
three times a day.

277
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,127
I heard the railroad pays good wages
if you're laying line.

278
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,071
They won't take you
if you ain't Chinese.

279
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,426
Anyway, it's back on the other side.

280
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,304
What are we gonna do then, Will,
besides run?

281
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,702
I don't know.

282
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,852
We'll light on something.

283
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,438
Well, one thing for sure,

284
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:47,257
I can't die any poorer than I started.

285
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,184
Guess he's living over yesterday.

286
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,600
I wish we had it back again.

287
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:55,113
Lady, our pockets is just as empty
as our bellies.

288
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,406
No.

289
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,001
Tod. Tod.

290
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,775
Get back. Give him some air.

291
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,970
It ain't nothing serious.
He's just hollow.

292
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:34,882
Mister, that was
my grandfather's timepiece.

293
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,259
He gave it to me on his death bed.

294
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,596
It's 18 karat gold,
and it ain't lost a minute in 30 years.

295
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,040
How much can you give me for it?

296
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,269
A hundred.

297
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,021
Dollars or pesos?

298
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,772
Pesos, señor.

299
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,091
That ain't but $10.

300
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,614
Mister, I robbed a bank.

301
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,558
I'm still not as big a bandit as you.

302
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,256
I don't know why he's so friendly
when I'm probably eating his brother.

303
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,718
Better stoke up
while it lasts for a while.

304
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,822
It isn't so bad really
if you don't get your nose too close.

305
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:10,168
You have come to the proper place.

306
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,636
Will, I don't know what it is,
but we must be doing something wrong.

307
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,998
Is he asleep again?

308
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,475
Yeah, he is.

309
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,189
He slept all day yesterday.

310
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,654
I know he did.

311
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,529
He don't do nothing but sleep anymore.

312
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,559
Tod.

313
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,161
Tod, wake up.

314
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,521
Tod, you gotta eat something.

315
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,565
I don't want anything.

316
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,358
You're gonna lose your strength
for when we get out of here.

317
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,568
Come on and eat.

318
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,653
We're never gonna get out of here.

319
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,597
I'm beginning to wonder
about that myself, Will.

320
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,825
It's been eight weeks.

321
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,019
Ain't we're ever gonna get up
in front of a judge?

322
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,040
Could be he doesn't come by
but once a year.

323
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,500
Like back home.

324
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,087
Maybe we could say we was Catholics
and ask to see a priest.

325
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,564
Maybe he'd help us out.

326
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,219
No, Catholics can smell out
a Baptist right off.

327
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,447
Then they won't have
nothing to do with 'em.

328
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,232
Yeah, they got a big church, all right.

329
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,027
Did you ever notice that
when they open that big door,

330
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,176
the altar piece they got over there
is made of gold?

331
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,910
Mr. Spikes!

332
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,703
Mr. Spikes! Mr. Spikes!

333
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,622
- Mr. Spikes! Hey!
- Mr. Spikes!

334
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,082
Mr. Spikes!

335
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,375
- Mr. Spikes!
- Mr. Spikes!

336
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,443
Mr. Spikes! Over here!

337
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,339
Mr. Spikes!

338
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,157
Mr. Spikes!

339
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:12,408
Well, well, well, three birds in a cage.

340
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,651
You sure come along
in the nick of time, Mr. Spikes.

341
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,152
We was just about cooked.

342
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,321
Me with running sores,
and him with dysentery,

343
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,906
and him with ticks eating him alive.

344
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,200
How'd you ever get us loose, Mr. Spikes?

345
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,579
Why, I rolled a $100 bill around a good cigar
and put another one in my handshake.

346
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,831
I don't know how we'll ever repay you.

347
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,499
I'll get you in a poker game some day,

348
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,149
but meanwhile, boys,
you'll better coming after a bath.

349
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,143
So you went and robbed
yourself a bank, did you?

350
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,854
Killed a man and lost the money.

351
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,857
Don't look like you boys
got the gift for it.

352
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,609
Well, I guess it's done,
and it can't be undone.

353
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,695
No way I know of.

354
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:10,157
Hell, two days after
they buried the man,

355
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:13,910
The Louisville Courier-Gazette
wrote a poem about you boys.

356
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,557
Had 15 verses.

357
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,374
Read like this.

358
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,127
"Three country boys, each one a knave

359
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,572
"slew a state senator
and sent him to his grave."

360
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,717
Sold a lot of papers.

361
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,969
That man we killed was a state senator?

362
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,888
That's right, son.

363
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,286
Friend to widows and orphans.

364
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,129
You brought down a big one, boys.

365
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,732
There's a bounty on you.

366
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,943
They don't care
whether you're cold or warm.

367
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:50,172
They'll pay $1,500 for each one of you.

368
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,408
That makes us sitting ducks, don't it?

369
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,076
Not knowing which way
we're gonna get flushed.

370
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,849
That's the game.

371
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,081
Sure didn't mean nothing
like this to come of it.

372
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,626
We didn't desire to commit murder.

373
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,273
It just kind of ran away from us.

374
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:09,029
Well, we all started out something else
way back.

375
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,203
What would you do
if you was us, Mr. Spikes?

376
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,682
Lie close.

377
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,851
Keep your boots by your bed.

378
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,312
Sit up quick when a dog barks.

379
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,006
Go out but little,
make no acquaintances.

380
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,693
Have nothing peculiar
about your manner or dress.

381
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,387
And above all, never talk.

382
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,430
It's the talking man gets caught.

383
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,456
Don't look so scared, boys.

384
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,524
Hell, look at me.

385
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,337
Madelia, Northfield,

386
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:50,215
Jonesboro, Elysian Township,

387
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,926
Marysville, Gallatin.

388
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:56,371
I ducked late a few times,
but I'm still standing.

389
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,308
The thing to do, my friends,

390
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,979
is submit to your fate
with Christian resignation

391
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,128
and live bravely
till your appointed time.

392
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,912
Bring the boys whatever you got left
that's fat and juicy.

393
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:25,188
And if you don't have anything cooked,
bring them a hind quarter raw.

394
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,838
I'd like you to keep track
of what your spending, Mr. Spikes.

395
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,173
We'll make good on it as soon as we can.

396
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,493
Don't worry about it.
I'll carry you for a while.

397
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:42,309
Well, you boys left the farm,
and you had some trouble.

398
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,352
You seen some of the world.

399
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,895
How do you find it?

400
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:50,191
We ain't really seen that much of it.
Just been chased through it.

401
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,737
Well, you're still better off
than most people.

402
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,906
Most people are tied
to one thing and one place.

403
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,659
They eat, work, and die doing it.

404
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,454
Don't seem to bother them.

405
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,683
But I say, "Break off a bigger hunk.
Come what may."

406
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,609
You, Jackson.

407
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,219
You damn fool! I don't even know you!

408
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,847
Jesus, God!
I thought you were someone else.

409
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,515
He's been looking
for somebody all night.

410
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,558
Well, he's found him.

411
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,393
No, sir! It's just a mistake.

412
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,021
Let him off. He's dead drunk.

413
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:31,566
Hell, we just come down from Eagle Pass
to have us a good time.

414
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,069
I'm middle-aged, and I'm tired of fools.

415
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,171
Make sure the next time.

416
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,348
Let's go.

417
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,301
Don't you think
we ought to find you a doctor?

418
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,428
I doctor myself.

419
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,781
This will scab up by morning.

420
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,868
Feels like I walked through barbed wire.

421
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,647
That whiskey-soaked son of a bitch.

422
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,024
I thought you were going to kill him.

423
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,318
Did you, son?

424
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,137
Well, I'm more careful than you think.

425
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,256
Why the hell should I pay
good money for it?

426
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,984
I'll get it free one of these days.

427
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,349
I'm going to a whorehouse now, boys,

428
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,794
to take my mind off my aches and pains,
so I'm sending you to bed.

429
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,480
Now here's a dollar apiece.

430
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,649
Get yourself a room
up at the Grand National Hotel

431
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,276
on the second floor.

432
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,925
The cockroaches don't crawl that high.

433
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,601
Them cowboys are still in town.

434
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,662
Maybe we should stick with him
for a while.

435
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,373
I don't think he'd like that.

436
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,817
Well, he doesn't have to see us.

437
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,530
Good morning, boys.

438
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,687
Morning, Mr. Spikes.

439
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,148
- Morning.
- You're up pretty early.

440
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,191
Yes, sir.

441
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,859
Just get here?

442
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,803
No, we've been sleeping here
most of the night.

443
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:45,700
Well, we was a little worried
about those cowboys from Eagle Pass.

444
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,993
Is that right?

445
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,561
Well, there was 10 of them.

446
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,395
Well, I thank you
for keeping an eye on me.

447
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,993
Come on. I'll buy you breakfast.

448
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,582
You can go down anytime
in this business.

449
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:22,403
Could be a man in a nice broadcloth coat
just stepping of a train,

450
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,823
picking cherries off a tree,

451
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,743
tipping his hat
and bidding good morning to you.

452
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,579
Any one of them can have your ticket.

453
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,148
This is the mayor and his wife.

454
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:44,259
He don't talk to me, but I nod to him.

455
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:47,637
Well, young gentlemen,
it's time for me to say adiós.

456
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,265
You're out of jail,
and your bellies are full.

457
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:53,059
You did me a good turn once,
and I'm not ungrateful.

458
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,894
I've enjoyed your company.

459
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,564
I hope you can say the same for me.

460
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,107
Won't we be seeing you
again, Mr. Spikes?

461
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,882
Not likely. I have business
to attend to. This is goodbye.

462
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:08,658
We sure do appreciate everything
you've done for us.

463
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,119
Take care of yourself, Mr. Spikes.

464
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,392
Don't roll out of bed.

465
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,668
He sure was friendly.

466
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,736
Yeah, he sure was.

467
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,259
Hard at it, boys.

468
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,137
Why, hello there, Mr. Spikes.

469
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,806
Smells of garbage in there.

470
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,015
Yes, sir, it does.

471
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,810
You've settled on dish washing
for your life's work?

472
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,229
No, this is our last day here.

473
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,189
The lady told us not to come back.

474
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,192
Yeah, we've busted
a few too many of her plates.

475
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,652
What you got lined up next?

476
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,989
Well, we figured to hire
on to dig holes.

477
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,241
That's what prairie dogs do.

478
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:16,220
Well, it's that or go without supper.

479
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:20,057
Take off those damned aprons
and come along.

480
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:44,480
Boys, I'm going to be your deliverance
and salvation.

481
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,692
Now don't ask me why I'm doing it.
It don't make no sense.

482
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,779
God knows I could get a dozen better
on any saloon down the street.

483
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,382
But you got some spirit,
and you got some craw.

484
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:58,015
Where I come from, you harness a mule,

485
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,331
but you give a horse a chance to run.

486
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,355
How would you boys like
to throw in with me?

487
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,677
It means goodbye to our folks,
and our home and all that.

488
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,221
Yeah, but it's that way now, Tod.

489
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,575
Well, one thing's for sure,
we'd get noticed.

490
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,230
We'll come in with you, Mr. Spikes.

491
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,066
- Thanks very much.
- Good.

492
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,383
Now, let's see if you can shoot.

493
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,339
This ain't too bad.

494
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,592
Okay, here's some shirts. Hey.

495
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,989
Look out. Here's some shirts.

496
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,268
Well, boys, how you feeling?

497
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,020
This tug is just so new and stiff

498
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,982
I don't think I van do anything
except sit bolt upright in a chair.

499
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:35,359
The ladies in this town are going
to whinny, prance and kick

500
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,927
just at the sight of you three.

501
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,890
Hold it. Hold it a minute.

502
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,165
Go ahead. Pull her out.

503
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:28,079
He's right.

504
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,273
Rotten to the core.

505
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,571
I'd never let him do that to me
without laughing gas.

506
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,926
Why, he's the same doctor
that took out my appendix

507
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,495
with only a quart and a half of tequila.

508
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,961
What do you think, boys? Solid gold.

509
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:58,359
Now, the side door is about 35 feet
from the front door.

510
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:01,654
Les, you'll come in this way.
Me and Will will go in through the front.

511
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:06,075
Now, once inside,
the teller stands here,

512
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:08,286
and generally, the guard over here.

513
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:11,872
They've got gold brick, but it's too heavy
for the horses, so we'll leave it.

514
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,166
They keep the money
in the vault back here.

515
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,877
But they've got some cash
in the drawer up front.

516
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,587
So while it ain't generally much,
we'll take it.

517
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,714
'Cause it'll aid the cause.

518
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,882
What if they just don't wanna
give it to us?

519
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,343
Then they're dead men for sure.

520
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:28,889
Remember, boys,
there's no arrest or trial for this crime.

521
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,725
Only convictions.

522
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:32,893
Now, Tod, we can't have
you standing around outside,

523
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,396
looking generally unemployed,
holding a bunch of horses.

524
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,274
So, four minutes after we leave,
you take off with the horses,

525
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:40,234
and you'll meet us
just as we're coming out.

526
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,757
- You got the watch?
- Yes, sir.

527
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,324
Good.

528
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,035
I know you boys will be plucky
and do your job.

529
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,012
Okay, I'll be on time.

530
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,645
Let's give it a try.

531
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:51,013
There's one other thing we ain't discussed
about bank-robbing, boys.

532
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,474
This is a good time as any.

533
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,018
If one of us should get caught
in a trap,

534
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,813
he's got to hang rather than talk.

535
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,415
Remember that.

536
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,740
All right, you boys'll do for this job.

537
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,659
Mr. Spikes?

538
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,452
Ain't we gonna take that bank?

539
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,601
Why, no, boys. I keep my own money
in that bank.

540
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,542
This ain't a bit bad, Mr. Spikes.

541
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,235
I'm a good cook.

542
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,630
I learned from my wife.

543
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,715
You was married?

544
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,341
Oh, yes.

545
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,193
To a wonderful lady.

546
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,030
A school teacher.

547
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,934
She could talk in French.

548
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,561
She played the piano.

549
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,938
She sang in a fine and sweet voice.

550
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,149
You don't say?

551
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,902
That lady made a man out of me.

552
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:30,154
She taught me everything.

553
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:31,989
How to read and write.

554
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,533
How to pull up to a table.

555
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,852
How to use a spoon and a fork.

556
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,389
I loved that woman.

557
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,725
What become of her, Mr. Spikes?

558
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,186
I killed her.

559
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,695
In another man's bed.

560
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:14,886
Wilson.

561
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,389
Sit here before me.

562
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:29,046
- Wilson.
- Yes, Pa.

563
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,298
You ran off from home.

564
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,383
Yes, sir.

565
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,426
Why did you go away?

566
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,929
One thing leads to another, Father.

567
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,681
You've broken the law.

568
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:41,141
You've corrupted and tainted our blood.

569
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,478
I'm doing the best I can
with what I've got.

570
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,938
How will it end?

571
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,648
I don't know.

572
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:50,693
Something's bound to happen.
Something's bound to.

573
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:53,779
How can I call you my son any longer?

574
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,927
How can I acknowledge you?

575
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:57,658
Wait.

576
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,010
You'll be cold.

577
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,937
You're cold now.

578
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,831
Wait!

579
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,023
Wait!

580
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,372
We'll cross back into the US
about two miles down.

581
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,125
Now, Uvalde's a dandy little town.

582
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,210
The bank there's got
lots of money in it.

583
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,129
It's an easy place
to get away from, too.

584
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,464
Don't it have a sheriff?

585
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,924
Why, sure, an old one.

586
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,302
He's got a deputy that's even older.

587
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,700
Two old men just gumming their food.

588
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:04,558
Why, we'll open up that bank
like a can of peaches.

589
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,501
Hot dog!

590
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,789
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

591
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,612
You know, when I first met you boys,
you were a sober bunch.

592
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:19,636
There was no mischief in you,
no day-dreaming.

593
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,844
Nothing but old before your time.

594
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:27,831
Well, you make the music, Mr. Spikes,
and we'll dance to it.

595
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,231
Hey! Hey! Hey!

596
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,600
Well, there she is, boys.

597
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,352
Just down the street from the bridge,

598
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,500
the Cattlemen's Bank of Uvalde.

599
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,565
How much money do you think they got
in there, Mr. Spikes?

600
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,775
Well, I was there myself

601
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:58,904
when Mr. J. P. Calhoun
deposited $20,000 in species.

602
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,098
That'll buy you a haircut
and a shave, son.

603
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,625
Why don't we just go on in
and clean it out right now, Mr. Spikes?

604
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,378
No, we'll wait till Saturday.
They'll have more money then.

605
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,922
That's when they open
the vault for payday.

606
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,758
Show a little patience, boys.

607
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:23,011
We'll make camp. Then I'll go in tonight
and scout around a little.

608
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,079
See how it all lays out.

609
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:39,987
You think that bank's
gonna be hard work?

610
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:43,699
I guess we're putting our heads
in the lion's mouth all right.

611
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:46,427
I just hope we can take it out again.

612
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,601
You got any kind of religion, Les?

613
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:56,003
I sort of always thought
of old Johnny God as being a big,

614
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:59,357
bald-headed man
with whiskers and a temper.

615
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,634
How about you?

616
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:06,034
Well, if there's a hell,
I'd like to keep out of it.

617
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,643
What you got there?

618
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,896
It's a letter.

619
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,481
If anything happens,

620
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,901
I want one of you two
to see that my mom gets it.

621
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,253
What'd you say in it?

622
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:25,842
"Dear Ma,

623
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:29,036
"I'm getting along fine.

624
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,580
"Eating good and sleeping good.

625
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,543
"I've took up with good company,
and every day has something new in it.

626
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,921
"I'm leading a different kind
of life than I led at home,

627
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:42,716
"with plenty of excitement
and adventure, which appeals to me.

628
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,194
"Every nickel I make is clear gain.

629
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:49,223
"The reason I'm writing this letter is

630
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:53,310
"I'm going into a desperate enterprise
in a day or two.

631
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,356
"If you don't think I've been
a good son, I'm sorry for it.

632
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:59,900
"Tell that to Pa, too.

633
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,844
"I hope Cissie is growing up
and all right.

634
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:07,178
"Goodbye, Momma,
if I never see you again."

635
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,191
How come you boys ain't looking lively?

636
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,202
How come you don't post a guard?

637
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,598
While you're sitting here by the fire
toasting your toes,

638
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,392
anybody could have walked right in

639
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:36,728
and plant a big juicy kiss on your cheek

640
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,876
or send you off to a long sleep.

641
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,299
Guess it was kind of dumb.

642
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,505
Live and learn.

643
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,777
Things is quiet in town.

644
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,066
They ain't expecting
a wild bunch like us.

645
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,735
Now you boys don't drink,

646
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,072
and you don't smoke.

647
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,712
So I brought you a bag of cinnamon buns.

648
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,333
Pretty widow makes them.

649
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,101
Now I'm gonna get myself drunk.

650
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,832
If I can just get my head empty,

651
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,355
then the true answers come to me.

652
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,172
I'd appreciate it
if you'd compose me for sleep.

653
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:48,634
Take off my boots
when you think I'm ready.

654
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,782
I'll say good night, boys.

655
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,187
We're being watched.

656
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,521
What?

657
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,774
Somebody's up there looking down.

658
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:05,797
Stay with your coffee.

659
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,237
- Well, who do you think it is?
- No idea.

660
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,214
Hello, down there!

661
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,803
Well, come on down. We got coffee.

662
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:25,479
Don't do nothing rash.

663
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,012
Take a cup.

664
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:58,053
I hope it's fresh cooked.

665
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,192
Ain't you got a cinnamon bun
to go with this?

666
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,966
This ain't no restaurant, old fella.

667
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:12,801
Where you from?

668
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,428
Just from town.

669
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:17,472
- And what town would that be?
- Why, Uvalde.

670
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,766
Didn't know there was any others around.

671
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,961
We wouldn't know.
We're just riding through.

672
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:27,875
It's a pretty big slug of ashes
just for one campfire.

673
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,027
What's your name?

674
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:32,070
Got a lot of names.

675
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,907
Billy Blanco, Kid White. Take your pick.

676
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,909
Why, I've heard of you.

677
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,745
You put a few in Boot Hill, haven't you?

678
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,455
Two or three rows.

679
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:44,104
Yeah. Took some from behind, I heard.

680
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,398
That's right, brother,
if that's the way they was facing.

681
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,569
What do you want of us?

682
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,033
I want in.

683
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,241
We ain't got nothing working.

684
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,848
Shit, Harry.

685
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:01,621
I spotted you in town.

686
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,708
Then I come out here,
and I see these three pups.

687
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:11,047
And damned if they ain't wanted
for killin' a senator in Carrizo Springs.

688
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,653
So?

689
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:17,098
So I figure that you're
after that bank in Uvalde.

690
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,118
I'm inviting myself in.

691
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,595
I'm pulling that job with you.

692
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:25,415
You smell of liniment
and old pee, Billy.

693
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,751
Why don't you drag your ass
upon a porch somewhere,

694
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:30,525
and eat your mush, and let
your grandchildren take care of ya?

695
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,799
What we got is beyond you.

696
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:36,051
You'll come to it.

697
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:38,245
There's grizzle in your beard, too.

698
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,701
Finish your coffee and ride on out.

699
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:45,310
I ain't asking for a regular share.
I'll take a half a share.

700
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,603
I'll take less than that.

701
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:50,424
There ain't no job. There ain't no bank,
and I ain't gonna tell you again.

702
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:58,015
I need a break.
I've been down on my luck lately.

703
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,119
Why, I even had to take a job
to keep me eating.

704
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:06,224
Pounding posts, and stringing wire,
and shit like that.

705
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,792
Why can't we let him go with us,
Mr. Spikes?

706
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:10,293
Because I say.

707
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,441
I still don't see why not.

708
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,465
Because he's old, damn it.

709
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,818
He's used up all his chances
to be lucky.

710
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:22,785
I'm still a damn good gunfighter.
I'll show you.

711
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,500
Let me fight

712
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,395
this feller. I'll prove it to you.

713
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,437
You just watch.

714
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:31,314
Wait a minute. I don't want to fight.

715
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,817
You'll be dead in a blink.

716
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,569
Come on, boy, draw!

717
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:36,987
Mister, I'm not gonna shoot with you.

718
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:40,532
You all think I'm an old rooster,
but I can still go.

719
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:43,556
And I'll show you. I can still go.

720
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:07,208
Well, you killed him.

721
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,729
He was going after Tod.

722
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:12,206
Yes, he was.

723
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:18,132
Well, that ought to do it.

724
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,468
He should have known when to quit.

725
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:45,472
An old man on this dodge
ought to get out while he can.

726
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:49,059
'Cause it don't hold up
over a long stretch.

727
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:52,395
He was nearly as old as my grandfather.

728
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:55,690
He had a safety pin
holding up his pants.

729
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,902
Son, what ain't foolishness
in this life is misery.

730
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:01,738
But we gotta hold ourselves
together somehow,

731
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,840
or we'd always be crying.

732
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:07,244
You better get some sleep.

733
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:10,097
We gotta hit that bank in the morning.

734
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,418
- I'd like to make a withdrawal.
- Your name, sir?

735
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,737
A fine, old, American name.

736
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:26,681
Colonel Samuel Colt,
and I'll take it all.

737
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:39,106
We'll sign the papers
in the morning, boys.

738
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,191
It's a hold-up!

739
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,803
Get out, Tod! Get out!

740
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:17,015
Go!

741
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,322
Tod!

742
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,242
I got him. Get away.

743
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,032
Come on! Let's get out of here!

744
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:50,904
Head for those rocks!

745
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,331
Get behind those rocks!

746
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:04,748
Run, Mr. Spikes! Run!

747
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,513
- How is he?
- Damn bad.

748
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:20,741
I think it nicked his lung.

749
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,980
Hey, you're shot up yourself.

750
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,566
Put some of this on.
It'll keep from getting gangrene.

751
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:30,918
Well, it ain't nothing.

752
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,075
I don't know
when I've liked a boy so much.

753
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,661
He was never noisy, never rude.

754
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,889
A born gentleman by nature.

755
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,985
Well, let's hope the ground that covers
his grave will always be green.

756
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:50,878
He's not dead yet.

757
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,131
He's a goner.

758
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:54,448
Say goodbye, and let's go.

759
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,362
He's still alive.

760
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:04,079
Put a hat over his face.
He ain't gonna make it.

761
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,186
He's still breathing!

762
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,105
Now, we're gonna take him to a doctor!

763
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,566
Just loading him on the horse
will be his end.

764
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,794
We ain't leaving Tod behind!

765
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,697
That posse'll be back.
We're already short a horse.

766
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,532
We won't make it unless we leave him.

767
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,225
Then we won't make it.

768
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,413
I'd stay by his side
if I thought it'd do him any good

769
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:27,206
and me no harm.

770
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:29,434
But that ain't the way it lies.

771
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:34,839
Don't you care nothing about him?
You just said you did.

772
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,091
I've left men dead behind me.

773
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,260
I've left men dying behind me.

774
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,888
And I've left them calling my name.

775
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:43,890
What you do is shut your ears,
and close your eyes,

776
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:46,017
and run like hell.

777
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:48,227
If you boys were older,
had been at it longer,

778
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:51,501
you'd know
that's the only way to stay alive.

779
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,927
I sure got a taste
of you now, Mr. Spikes.

780
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:02,450
I am not a follower
of the meek and lowly Jesus.

781
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,535
I never said I was.

782
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:07,479
I hope to God you boys make it.

783
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:18,533
You mean to shoot me?
Is that why you have your gun out?

784
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,452
My back is wide. You can't miss.

785
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:08,790
Easy.

786
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,736
I'm gonna get a blanket to cover him up.

787
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,237
- It's awful hot.
- Yeah, I know.

788
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,741
But I think that's
what you're supposed to do.

789
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,743
Why don't he open his eyes?

790
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:28,845
He's been bleeding a lot.

791
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,439
Tod?

792
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:36,026
Tod?

793
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,785
I'm gonna go get a doctor.

794
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,347
We better switch pants
'cause mine's got blood on 'em.

795
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:49,682
Why don't you let me go?

796
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:53,561
No, with this neck,
it'll be natural for me to ask.

797
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:55,730
I'll just say I did it on a hay fork.

798
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,607
I hate seeing you take the risk.

799
01:12:57,707 --> 01:12:59,709
Well, it'll be just fine.

800
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:46,656
I'd like to ask you a question, mister.

801
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,324
First, what are you drinking?

802
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,742
Well, what do you have?

803
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:52,245
Whiskey or beer. Beer's warm.

804
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:53,913
I'll have it anyhow.

805
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:55,811
That'll be two bits.

806
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,526
Is there a doctor around here?

807
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,774
What do you need a doctor for?

808
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:10,429
Well, I've got this cut here,
and I wanted to get it patched up.

809
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:14,976
That little thing? That ain't nothing.
Put some whiskey on it.

810
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:16,936
No, I'd rather have a doctor.

811
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:20,381
There's a doctor in Uvalde.
Why don't you go there?

812
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,401
Well, I'm heading the other way.

813
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:27,238
Well, there's two brothers on a ranch,
what, 10 miles east of here.

814
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:31,343
One of 'em studied to be a dentist.
He fixes up cuts and what not.

815
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:34,954
Well, thank you, mister.

816
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:38,374
How'd you say
you got that little scratch?

817
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,709
I did it on a hay fork.

818
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:43,504
Well, don't be in such a rush.
Stay and have another drink.

819
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:44,881
No, I gotta get kicking.

820
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,279
Hell, I'm buying. Now, belly up.

821
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,802
I'd rather not.

822
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:53,827
Man can't stay for a free drink
must be in a hell of a hurry.

823
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:58,311
You must be in a powerful hurry.

824
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:01,022
No hurry, mister. I've just had enough.

825
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:02,920
That ain't friendly.

826
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,505
Is it, Charlie?

827
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:09,422
Suppose we sat on you
and poured it down?

828
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:14,101
Mister, I treat people good
if they treat me good.

829
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:18,181
If they don't,
I give 'em back what they send.

830
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,691
Les, there ain't a doctor.

831
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,344
They said there's some kind of dentist
about 10 miles east of here.

832
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:15,446
Maybe he can help us.

833
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,582
He's gone.

834
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,166
He just stopped breathing.

835
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:42,314
It's funny, isn't it?

836
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:44,893
What?

837
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:50,440
How you and me and Tod
all growed up together.

838
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:56,738
And now, one of us has finally
gotten himself killed.

839
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,120
We're gonna have to tell his people.

840
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:08,040
What do we say to 'em?

841
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,610
That it is our fault.

842
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:14,338
That we're the ones that led him to it.

843
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,643
I told him it was gonna be fun.

844
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:24,190
We're gonna have to bury him.

845
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:32,106
Are you afraid of ghosts?

846
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,698
Ain't no ghost of his
is gonna bother me.

847
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:39,614
I loved him.

848
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:14,281
Come on. Let's get back to Mexico.

849
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,128
Will.

850
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:34,669
Don't scare him off.

851
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:38,176
Nice morning, ain't it?

852
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:46,021
Have you got anything to eat?

853
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:21,341
He didn't think we'd pay.
We must really look like bandits.

854
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:26,745
These folks around here are
real nice and gentle, you know that?

855
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:28,017
Yeah, they are.

856
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,375
I could live around them
and do just fine.

857
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:32,727
We wouldn't need much.

858
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:37,156
He don't look like he's got much.
He's smiling.

859
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,717
Well, after I get back
from seeing Tod's folks,

860
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:41,010
we'll see about it.

861
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,262
After you get back?

862
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:45,285
We're both gonna go deliver that letter.

863
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:50,832
I had a dream about us last night.

864
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:57,547
We was both up
on these great big, fine-looking horses.

865
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:00,838
We was barefoot.

866
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:06,018
And we was riding
through these blue mountains.

867
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:12,434
Everything around us looked
like it was just made that minute.

868
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:18,005
You know, all the grass,
and the trees, and the ferns,

869
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:20,483
and the woods and everything.

870
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:26,222
I looked over to you, and I said,

871
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:27,494
"Will,

872
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:30,706
"ain't it a grand life?"

873
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:27,074
- Hot day.
- Ain't they all?

874
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:29,677
Give me a shot of the best you got.

875
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:34,248
Hello, Harry.

876
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:36,100
Well, hello, Billy.

877
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:43,824
I hear you been on the run, Harry.

878
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:47,886
Well, what else did you hear?

879
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:51,598
Well, I've been serving time
down in Prairie City

880
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:54,935
at George Fredrick's. Remember George?

881
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:56,562
Well, he's the Marshal down there now.

882
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,773
He told me if I ran into you,
to ask you to go down and see him.

883
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:02,067
He's got a proposition for you.

884
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:03,235
Proposition?

885
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,904
Yeah, I think it's a good one.

886
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:09,658
He said if you don't like it,
you could ride out just like you rode in.

887
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,493
Nothing to lose.

888
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,688
You can trust George.
Why don't you give it a try?

889
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:17,524
I don't know, Billy.

890
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:25,066
Thanks, Harry.

891
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:56,455
Les, I've gone to deliver
the letter to Tod's folks.

892
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:59,917
I've got a long start on you,
so don't try to follow me.

893
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:02,920
Meet me in Piedras Negras
two weeks from today

894
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,964
in that big Catholic church
with the gold altar.

895
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:10,535
Don't forget there's a price
on our heads, so don't get careless.

896
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:55,114
Hello, Cissie.

897
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:57,992
Hello, Wilson.

898
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:01,061
Is your ma and dad home?

899
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:03,021
Gone into town.

900
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,440
For how long?

901
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,714
Till dark. You back from running away?

902
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:14,575
For a while.

903
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:16,348
Where you been to?

904
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:18,596
All around.

905
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:21,724
My daddy says you're trash.

906
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,293
That's up to him.

907
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,521
Didn't you bring Tod back?

908
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:28,589
No.

909
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:29,986
Why not?

910
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:35,825
You wouldn't recognize Tod, Cissie.
He's doing so well.

911
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:40,434
He's got all new clothes,
and he's grown a head taller than me.

912
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:42,502
He's as happy as can be.

913
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:46,674
His dog belongs to me now,
and I ain't givin' him back.

914
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:49,209
He wouldn't ask you to.

915
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,823
He sent this letter.

916
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,742
You see your ma and daddy get it.

917
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:58,014
I will.

918
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:03,474
You want some lemon cake, Wilson?
We got some.

919
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:08,566
I can't stay, Cissie.

920
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,753
You don't need that gun.

921
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:09,231
You Wilson Young?

922
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:10,924
I want to know
who you are first, mister.

923
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:15,028
I'm Jack Basset. Les sent me.

924
01:26:15,128 --> 01:26:16,780
Why didn't he come himself?

925
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,991
That's what I'm going to tell you.

926
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:22,077
You see, him and me,
we got acquainted over to the hotel,

927
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:24,997
and we've been kickin'
around together all week.

928
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:27,441
He told me you'd be here tonight.

929
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:31,003
What's wrong with him?

930
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:33,071
I hate to be the one to tell ya.

931
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:35,841
Just say if he's alive or not!

932
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,010
He was this morning.

933
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:40,345
They got him over to the infirmary.

934
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:41,847
No.

935
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:44,099
He's shot up awful bad.

936
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,310
They got him while he was
in his bed in the hotel.

937
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:48,128
They hit him four times.

938
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:52,295
I don't see how he's hung on this long.

939
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:06,346
Who did it?

940
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:08,123
There was two of 'em.

941
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:11,251
They ain't even law.
They're damn bounty hunters.

942
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:14,651
One's named Morton, and one's Spikes.

943
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:17,257
- Who'd you say?
- Morton.

944
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:18,675
No, the other one.

945
01:27:18,775 --> 01:27:19,992
Spikes.

946
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:29,728
What you figuring on doing, son?

947
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:31,104
I'm gonna get Les out of there.

948
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:33,649
But Morton and Spikes is
taking turns watching him.

949
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:37,235
They got a chair parked
right in front of the door to his room.

950
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:38,445
Do they ever come out?

951
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:41,073
Once in a while for a breath of air.

952
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:42,783
That'll be enough.

953
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:44,242
Which one's on now?

954
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:47,312
Morton. Spikes is sleepin'
over to the hotel.

955
01:27:48,972 --> 01:27:50,415
Mister, could I ask you for a favor?

956
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:52,584
Well, you've done me one already,
but could I ask you for another?

957
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:53,919
Sure, son.

958
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:56,797
Could you go over to the hotel
and keep an eye on Spikes for me?

959
01:27:56,897 --> 01:28:00,242
I will. Don't you fight him fair.

960
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:13,751
You.

961
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,675
Step out where I can get a look at you.

962
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:27,719
Who are you? Don't I know you?

963
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:31,289
No. No, sir, you don't.

964
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:33,458
What do you want around here?

965
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:35,961
Well, I don't want nothing.

966
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,754
Then move on.

967
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:39,798
My sheep dog's run off from me.

968
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:42,551
He's got a brown muzzle.
You ain't seen him, have you?

969
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:44,278
I told you to move on.

970
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:47,347
Well, then maybe you seen my friend.

971
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:50,308
He lives in Llano County.
I've known him all my life.

972
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:51,955
And he's well-liked by everybody.

973
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:53,749
You're Wilson Young.

974
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:18,903
Les.

975
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,673
Les, listen.

976
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:24,342
That northbound train pulls
out of here in half an hour.

977
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:26,285
We're gonna be on it.

978
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,563
Maybe we'll go to Montana.

979
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:39,633
To them blue mountains
you was talking about.

980
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:44,087
We'll find a place of our own to live.

981
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,658
Maybe we can run some cattle

982
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:50,635
and a few good horses.

983
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:53,371
I can build a cabin

984
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:56,395
and just sit up there
on our own front porch.

985
01:30:58,370 --> 01:30:59,838
Hello, boy.

986
01:31:00,664 --> 01:31:03,191
I just killed Mr. Morton
down the street.

987
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,734
No loss.

988
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:06,611
You're next.

989
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:08,088
Well, that ain't decided yet.

990
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:10,849
I didn't come here to talk.

991
01:31:12,342 --> 01:31:15,328
Funny how things work out.

992
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:19,457
The governor of the state of Texas
gave me a chance to come in, full amnesty,

993
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:21,685
for all my acts and crimes.

994
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:26,280
As long as I delivered you two.

995
01:31:27,691 --> 01:31:30,865
I handed him my pistol,
butt-first, and I said,

996
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:35,307
"I am giving you that
which I have never allowed

997
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:39,332
"another living man to touch,
except myself."

998
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:45,734
And he pumped my hand.

999
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:48,153
And they took my picture.

1000
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:50,676
And two ladies present wept.

1001
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,327
Your gun's in the holster.

1002
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:58,226
You'd better sit up,
or you can't reach it.

1003
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:03,522
I wanted to bring Les in alive.

1004
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:07,822
I would have liked it better that way.

1005
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:10,608
But he pulled on me.

1006
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,387
Is that the last thing
you want to say to me?

1007
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:15,909
'Cause it ain't much.

1008
01:32:17,115 --> 01:32:20,226
Anything I ever got
in this life was by felony.

1009
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:22,854
I've been a hungry dog,
snapping at meat.

1010
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:26,128
And then you boys came along.
You looked up to me.

1011
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:30,387
What did you want from me, anyhow?

1012
01:32:31,171 --> 01:32:34,616
I don't know anymore.
It was a foolish hope.

1013
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:36,514
Better luck next time.

1014
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:39,353
Sit up, Mr. Spikes.

1015
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:45,317
You're a fine boy.

1016
01:32:46,269 --> 01:32:49,130
If we'd met in a different life,

1017
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,091
we might've took a walk
down a shady street

1018
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:54,052
and looked at the ladies
through the window panes.

1019
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:58,703
Or I might've carved a Sunday roast
and given you the biggest portion.

1020
01:33:01,993 --> 01:33:04,270
But don't let me mix you up.

1021
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:05,496
Sit up!

1022
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:18,218
Right there.

1023
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:20,704
Is this all?

1024
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:23,557
It ain't really fair,
but it's all I'm givin' you.

1025
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:51,437
And by God, the one thing we won't ever do
is kiss no man's boot!

1026
01:35:51,537 --> 01:35:52,834
You bet!

1027
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:55,841
Let's go get lucky!
