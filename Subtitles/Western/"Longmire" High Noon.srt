[camera shutter snapping]

3
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:22,956
Whoa!

4
00:01:23,815 --> 00:01:25,900
Cheese and rice, man.

5
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:28,109
- Just about gave me a heart attack.
- That's good.

6
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,319
Who are you?

7
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,405
My name's Bob Barnes.

8
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:35,409
I, uh... Working out here
for the forest service.

9
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,578
We're surveying the whole county

10
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,706
trying to eradicate
non-native species of weeds.

11
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:45,711
As a Native myself, I appreciate
the spirit of your work.

12
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:48,505
But as the owner of this property,

13
00:01:48,506 --> 00:01:51,675
I'm gonna have to ask you to stay off it.

14
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:54,278
Of course, sir. I meant no harm.

15
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:57,239
Sorry to disturb you.

16
00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:09,359
You're positive this was
on Nighthorse's property?

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,819
I am.

18
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,029
That guy is intense.

19
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,842
- You saw him?
- He kind of snuck up on me.

20
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:19,453
You see anything else
unusual on the property?

21
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:21,871
Yeah, near his garden. He had this...

22
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:24,833
this wooden stake stuck down
in the ground, and then it had,

23
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:28,086
like, a long, thick,
leather strap attached to it.

24
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:30,004
- What kind of garden?
- I'm not sure.

25
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:33,300
There was nothing growing, but
the soil was freshly turned.

26
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:35,069
I think he just planted it.

27
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:42,392
Vic, you there?

28
00:02:42,393 --> 00:02:44,686
[Vic] Hey, Walt, I'm just
pulling up to the station.

29
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:46,896
I need you to get those warrants in order.

30
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:48,189
[Vic] Nighthorse?

31
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,500
Yep.

32
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:53,111
- Thanks, Bob.
- It's me who should be thanking you,

33
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:55,656
Walt, for getting me this job.

34
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:57,967
It's helping me to get my footing.

35
00:02:58,033 --> 00:03:00,661
It's volunteer work, Bob.
Doesn't even pay, so...

36
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:05,582
True, but it gives me structure,
a sense of responsibility.

37
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,625
Self-respect.

38
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:08,710
A man's got to work, Bob, and in your case,

39
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:10,003
it's court ordered, so...

40
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:11,522
[Ruby] Walt, it's Ruby.

41
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:13,923
How close are you to the
Sinclair station east of town?

42
00:03:13,924 --> 00:03:15,234
Not far. What's up?

43
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:18,470
[Ruby] A trucker just called in
a reckless driver in a black SUV

44
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:22,474
heading south on 232 and
swerving pretty badly.

45
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:24,243
Okay, I'll check it out.

46
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:32,585
[tires squealing]

[tires screech, metal crunches]

50
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,875
Leave me alone.

51
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:15,670
[grunts] You all right?

52
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:17,379
Am I?

53
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:20,156
I don't know.

54
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:23,302
I can't feel my... anything.

55
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:26,472
[Walt] Come on, Barlow.

56
00:04:27,582 --> 00:04:29,082
Let's get you out of there.

57
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,185
[grunts]

58
00:04:37,508 --> 00:04:40,361
- [grunts]
- Easy does it.

59
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:45,616
Big step.

60
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:47,976
I got you. I got you.

61
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:49,227
Who's got you?

62
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:50,705
I'm not sure.

63
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,190
You taking me to jail?

64
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:56,526
Well, I ought to.

65
00:04:56,527 --> 00:04:58,779
I, uh, think maybe you've
been through enough,

66
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,030
so I'll just take you home, Barlow.

67
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:02,257
Okay.

68
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:05,636
Well, on the...

69
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:11,183
Oh. There you are.

70
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:15,420
Come on. Buckle up.

71
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:17,565
I was buckled up.

72
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:19,901
You de-buckled me. Get out of the way.

73
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:22,552
Okay, you do it.

74
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:26,222
I've got it. How's your head?

75
00:05:26,223 --> 00:05:28,683
I'm all right.

76
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:30,978
[engine turns over]

77
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,414
This doesn't look like my seatbelt.

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,743
[Cady] All set?

81
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:48,846
[man] Thank you. Great meal.

82
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,877
[Cady] Um, I-I think
there must be a mistake.

83
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:57,462
I don't think so.

84
00:05:57,463 --> 00:05:59,815
- The... The tip is too big.
- Well, how much is it?

85
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:01,508
It's $50,000.

86
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:03,360
[chuckles] Let me see that.

87
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:07,096
Oh.

88
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:08,807
I see what I did.

89
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:10,976
It's not a tip.

90
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:12,787
It's an offer.

91
00:06:12,854 --> 00:06:14,288
For what?

92
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:18,358
My name's Kevin Morris.

93
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:21,444
I work for a Boston-based
law firm called Dow & Morris,

94
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:23,404
and we just opened an
office here in Durant.

95
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:28,451
My job is to find and hire
the best lawyers in this state.

96
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:29,887
Starting with you, "Caddy."

97
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:32,873
Me? Why?

98
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:34,976
Your work on the Henry Standing Bear case.

99
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:36,710
Word gets out.

100
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:38,813
You're smart. You're young.

101
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,338
You know the community.

102
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:44,026
And we'd much rather have you
arguing beside us than against us.

103
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:46,821
You know...

104
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:51,182
Think it over.

105
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:52,827
Give me a call.

106
00:06:56,564 --> 00:06:58,290
[sighs]

107
00:06:58,357 --> 00:06:59,374
Mr. Morris.

108
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:01,693
Um, it's Cady.

109
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:03,194
What?

110
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:05,881
My name... You pronounced
it wrong. It's Cady.

111
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:07,074
C-a-d-y?

112
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:08,658
[Cady] Yeah.

113
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:10,302
I think you're spelling it wrong.

114
00:07:19,795 --> 00:07:21,897
[sighs]

115
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:26,401
Aw, shit.

116
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:30,239
Left the keys in the damn car.

117
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:33,433
You got a spare? Or maybe there's
a window open here we can...

118
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:35,744
- [grunts]
- [glass shatters, alarm blares]

119
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:40,273
Sheriff, I want to report a break-in.

120
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:42,126
Yeah.

121
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:57,373
I thought you might want to sober up.

122
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:58,374
Hm.

123
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:02,104
Or maybe go the other way.

124
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:10,428
Thanks, Walt. You ought to join me.

125
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:12,656
Go grab a glass.

126
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:16,118
Well, I'm not a whiskey man, so...

127
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:20,271
Well, beer, then...
There's beer in the fridge.

128
00:08:20,272 --> 00:08:22,231
Any Rainier?

129
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:25,234
No. No Rainier.

130
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:27,570
Just some imported shit.

131
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:29,781
[chuckles] I'll pass.

132
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:31,759
[Barlow sighs]

133
00:08:33,285 --> 00:08:35,429
[sighs]

134
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,643
You know, uh, Barlow, um...

135
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:48,442
I don't usually like to discuss
details of investigations,

136
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:52,029
but, uh, there's something
I think you deserve to know.

137
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:57,618
I don't think Branch killed himself.

138
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:00,895
What?

139
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:02,689
He's not dead?

140
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,294
I mean, I have reason to believe
that someone murdered him.

141
00:09:11,323 --> 00:09:14,593
If somebody killed Branch,
got to be Nighthorse.

142
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:17,578
Why do you say that?

143
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:24,103
[Barlow] Well, he's been trying
to get at me in all sorts of ways.

144
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,130
He planted those old Indian
bones on my golf course

145
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:29,399
to try and stall my development.

146
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,736
But I don't go down easy.

147
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:37,849
When he saw he couldn't get at me, he...

148
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,702
went after the thing I loved.

149
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:46,500
If someone went after my daughter, I...

150
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:49,544
I don't know what I'd do.

151
00:09:49,611 --> 00:09:51,380
- We got to get him.
- I will.

152
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:53,382
I will.

153
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:56,802
But I need to do it legally,
and you need to stay out of it.

154
00:09:57,745 --> 00:10:00,681
Now, are you gonna be
okay here on your own?

155
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:04,810
You worried I'm gonna shoot myself?

156
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:10,983
Connallys aren't cowards, Walt.

157
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:18,907
We don't kill ourselves.

158
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,104
Where are the keys to your other car?

159
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:26,355
I don't want you driving,
not in your state of mind.

160
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:28,149
You're grounded as far as I'm concerned.

161
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,236
Oh, they're, uh, in the
other room in a desk.

162
00:10:31,237 --> 00:10:33,362
- I can... Oh.
- Come on. Take it easy.

163
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:35,465
Just... Right there. Take a seat.

164
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:39,786
Okay, they're in there. [sighs]

165
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:43,015
- Here you go.
- You're the sheriff.

166
00:10:44,374 --> 00:10:47,061
[sighs] Ooh.

167
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:05,019
Mm.

168
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,147
Arrowleaf balsamroot.

169
00:11:07,148 --> 00:11:09,565
That's those sunflower-looking things?

170
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:10,733
[Walt] They are.

171
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:13,503
[clears throat] Well...

172
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:16,405
for a man of few words, Walt,

173
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:19,385
this is one long warrant application.

174
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:21,286
I wanted to be as
thorough as possible, so...

175
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:23,746
Mm-hmm. Well, I'll tell you what.

176
00:11:23,747 --> 00:11:25,557
I'm gonna give you a search warrant.

177
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:29,460
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- But not for Jacob Nighthorse's property.

178
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:31,462
I'll give you a warrant for my home,

179
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:35,424
because those sunflowers grow
like weeds along the driveway.

180
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:37,635
In fact, they grow practically everywhere.

181
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:40,221
Not along the river where
we found Branch's body.

182
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:43,724
Well, that may well be, but
that's not evidence enough

183
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:46,227
to cast suspicion on Jacob Nighthorse.

184
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:48,146
You mean Jacob Blankenship.

185
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:50,398
Ah, I almost forgot.

186
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,294
The mysterious legal-name change.

187
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:55,504
It speaks to a pattern of deceit.

188
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,613
[chuckles] It speaks to an Indian wanting

189
00:11:57,614 --> 00:12:00,634
to sound a little more like an Indian.

190
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:05,097
Look, you clearly have a significant
bug up your ass about this, Walt,

191
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:09,351
but I can't let you disturb a
citizen based on this thin evidence,

192
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:13,338
particularly since you've played
so fast and loose with protocol.

193
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:14,922
I mean, for all I know,

194
00:12:14,923 --> 00:12:17,300
you could've put that
dirt in the shotgun casing.

195
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,736
I fully documented the chain of custody.

196
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:22,096
When you deputized your best friend,

197
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:25,826
the recently released prisoner,
to transport the evidence.

198
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:27,310
We're shorthanded, Your Honor.

199
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:29,396
[Mayhew] Well, then hire a new deputy.

200
00:12:29,397 --> 00:12:34,709
But your request for a search warrant
on Jacob Nighthorse's property is denied.

201
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:38,946
Walt.

202
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:40,656
Not in the mood to talk now, Vic.

203
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:43,576
Well, that's nothing new,
but you don't have to talk.

204
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:45,953
We can, like, go get a burger or something.

205
00:12:45,954 --> 00:12:47,955
I need you to look into Nighthorse's alibi

206
00:12:47,956 --> 00:12:50,375
for the window of time
around when Branch was killed.

207
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:52,001
You are his alibi.

208
00:12:52,002 --> 00:12:54,128
You're the one that told
me that he was out of town.

209
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:55,504
I saw him get off a plane.

210
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:58,132
How do I know he was where he
said he was? Could've been an act.

211
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:00,194
Check his flight details.

212
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:02,904
Have Ferg look into his credit cards.

213
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:04,532
Okay.

214
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:08,517
Anything else?

215
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:10,579
The burger... Thanks, but not tonight.

216
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,190
[engine turns over]

217
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:16,668
[engine revs, tires squeal]

218
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:28,413
[Catherine] This is a
confidentiality agreement.

219
00:13:28,414 --> 00:13:31,225
It says that you can't disclose
the firm's trade secrets,

220
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:33,126
client list, et cetera.

221
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:36,522
Go ahead and sign here and initial there.

222
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:41,193
Okay. Before Ms. Longmire gets
bored and changes her mind,

223
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,154
I thought she might be curious
about her compensation package.

224
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:45,822
So...

225
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:50,518
That's not the salary we discussed.

226
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,061
We haven't talked about salary.

227
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:53,604
You said $50,000.

228
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:56,750
That was your year-one bonus,
assuming you meet certain benchmarks.

229
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:59,836
We wouldn't expect you
to live on that salary.

230
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,510
- Is... Is there a problem?
- [Cady chuckles]

231
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:09,304
No.

232
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:10,830
No, there's no problem.

233
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:13,124
Would you like to review
your health-plan options?

234
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,477
Yes, I would like that very much.

235
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:23,217
Good morning, Ruby. How are you today?

236
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:26,387
Mathias, why don't you take a seat?
I'll tell the sheriff that you're here.

237
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:28,389
That's okay. I want to surprise him.

238
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,118
Oh, I like what you've
done with your hair, Philly.

239
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:34,121
Sheriff.

240
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:38,083
I need to see your guns.

241
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:42,570
[Walt] What? My guns? What for?

242
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:44,905
Oh, what does it matter? You
haven't done anything wrong.

243
00:14:44,906 --> 00:14:46,716
So, just let me take a look at them.

244
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,243
- You got a warrant?
- Nope.

245
00:14:49,244 --> 00:14:52,222
And you know I couldn't
get one even if I wanted to.

246
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:53,914
Why would you want to,

247
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:56,543
except for the simple
pleasure of annoying me?

248
00:14:56,544 --> 00:15:00,230
Someone fired off two .30-caliber
rounds at Jacob Nighthorse last night.

249
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:02,899
Where?

250
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:06,927
Right there at his home.

251
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:09,096
Nighthorse doesn't live on the Res.

252
00:15:09,097 --> 00:15:10,973
What's this got to do with you?

253
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:13,309
Wondered the same thing
when Nighthorse called me

254
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,664
since I have no authority in your county.

255
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,375
Did you really accuse
Nighthorse of killing Branch?

256
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:23,277
Then you could understand why
he didn't feel too comfortable

257
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:24,796
about calling you in.

258
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:30,034
I didn't shoot at anybody
last night, Mathias.

259
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:31,178
Great.

260
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:33,805
Then let me check out all your guns.

261
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,016
No.

262
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:39,060
[sighs]

263
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:40,711
Okay.

264
00:15:40,712 --> 00:15:42,439
Well, I tried.

265
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:46,818
There's nothing else I can do,
then, except call in the feds.

266
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:54,475
[man] Mr. Nighthorse!

267
00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:56,018
[reporters speaking indistinctly]

268
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:58,580
The bullet went right by my head.

269
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:00,648
Missed me by less than two feet.

270
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:02,358
[camera shutter snaps]

271
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:07,154
Now, coming, as this did, on
the heels of repeated harassment

272
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:08,256
by Sheriff Longmire,

273
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:12,135
it's pretty clear to me that the
sheriff was behind the shooting.

274
00:16:13,412 --> 00:16:15,764
Walt Longmire has tried to
connect me to several crimes

275
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,141
that I had nothing to do with.

276
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,877
So, I'm hopeful that, by shining a light

277
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:26,257
on the activities of his backward, corrupt,

278
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:29,194
and prejudiced Sheriff's Department,

279
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:32,221
we may be able to rein in
the worst of their excesses.

280
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:35,516
But... But barring that, I
just want to say right now...

281
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:38,144
- [telephone ringing]
- ...if I end up dead

282
00:16:38,145 --> 00:16:40,146
in the coming days or weeks,

283
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:44,084
the first person you should
look at is your sheriff.

284
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:48,028
Sheriff's Department.
This is Deputy Ferguson.

285
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:49,548
[Henry] Hello, Ferg. This is Henry.

286
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:52,050
[Ferg] Hey, Henry, you want
me to get the sheriff for you?

287
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:53,176
[Henry] Maybe.

288
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:56,496
Depends on how you
answer a question for me.

289
00:16:56,497 --> 00:16:58,932
Do you know where he was last night?

290
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,583
[sighs]

291
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:05,021
I was off duty, so, no, I
don't know where Walt was.

292
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:10,718
Hello?

293
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,946
Is he gone?

294
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:15,031
- Who?
- Mathias.

295
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,225
Yeah. He's gone.

296
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:19,977
[Vic] Good.

297
00:17:19,978 --> 00:17:23,105
I don't want to have to
answer any of his questions.

298
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:25,232
I don't want him to
ask me where you've been

299
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:28,653
or where you were last night or
when the last time I saw you was.

300
00:17:28,654 --> 00:17:29,570
Why not?

301
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:31,757
Because I don't want
to have to lie for you.

302
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:33,007
- Vic, listen...
- No.

303
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:35,535
I don't want you to have
to lie to me, either.

304
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:38,705
Look, I get it... It sucks that
Nighthorse is getting away with this,

305
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:40,265
and it's actually kind of brilliant

306
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:42,791
because you shoot at him, and
now his house is a crime scene

307
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,961
and you don't need a search
warrant anymore, but, Jesus, Walt!

308
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:49,757
He has got great lawyers. And now
Mathias is calling in the feds.

309
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:52,134
You might've blown your only
chance you had to get him,

310
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:54,070
and you might even lose your job.

311
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:58,074
I know that you have a
.30-caliber rifle, and I just...

312
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:01,519
I cannot get in the middle of
one of these situations again.

313
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,729
- Vic.
- Not even for you.

314
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,021
- Listen to me.
- What?!

315
00:18:04,022 --> 00:18:06,834
I will never ask you to lie for me.

316
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:10,110
I know you can't verify
where I was last night.

317
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:11,445
No one can.

318
00:18:11,446 --> 00:18:13,089
[sighs]

319
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:17,284
I need you to take a breath
and go find Bob Barnes.

320
00:18:17,285 --> 00:18:18,327
Bob? Why?

321
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:22,415
Because what you just said about
Nighthorse's house, you're right.

322
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,333
We have a way in now.

323
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:26,645
And Bob knows where we need to look.

324
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:30,631
[sighs]

325
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:32,066
Vic.

326
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,968
Come on, we got to get over
there before Nighthorse's lawyers

327
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:37,155
or the feds find some way to stop us.

328
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:58,593
What are you doing here?

329
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,136
My job.

330
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:02,222
Aah!

331
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:03,932
Mathias reported a crime.

332
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:05,475
I'm out here to investigate it.

333
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:08,877
I reported that crime to Mathias, not you.

334
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:10,898
He doesn't have any authority off the Res.

335
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:12,923
Then I withdraw my report.

336
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:15,342
Nothing happened here,
and you can be on your way.

337
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:19,012
Well, someone's, uh, taking
shots at residents in my county,

338
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:20,848
- that's a public-safety issue.
- Aw, please!

339
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:23,517
I don't care if you file a report or not.

340
00:19:23,518 --> 00:19:25,495
I'm compelled to investigate.

341
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:28,623
You and I both know you did this.

342
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,942
Actually, based on how quickly you
pulled that press conference together,

343
00:19:31,943 --> 00:19:34,003
I'm inclined to think maybe you did this.

344
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,363
- I shot at myself?
- Sure you did.

345
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:40,218
Create a false pretense which
allows you to harass me in the media.

346
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:43,329
"A false pretense which
allows you to harass me."

347
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,665
That is a perfect turn of phrase.

348
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,309
I'm gonna pass that along
to my lawyer right now.

349
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,815
Is he in your truck?

350
00:19:55,843 --> 00:19:57,635
Yeah, it's Jacob.

351
00:19:57,636 --> 00:20:00,363
You'll never guess who just
showed up to search my property...

352
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,031
without a warrant!

353
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:12,024
Hey.

354
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:14,401
Show me where you spotted
the arrowleaf balsamwood

355
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:15,754
and that new flower bed.

356
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:18,006
Bob?

357
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:20,700
You never said anything
about people getting shot at.

358
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:21,826
What?

359
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:23,703
I thought you got me
this job to help me out.

360
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:25,639
I didn't know you were
gonna put me in danger.

361
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:27,874
- You weren't in any danger.
- Oh, come on, Walt.

362
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,644
Why didn't you come out here and
look for that flower yourself?

363
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:33,396
I'm not exactly welcome
on Nighthorse's property.

364
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:36,006
So you send me out here
to trespass for you?

365
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:39,092
You're not trespassing, and I
would never send you into danger.

366
00:20:39,093 --> 00:20:44,097
I honestly had no idea anyone was
gonna be firing a weapon out here.

367
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:46,326
Now can you please show me
where you saw that flower?

368
00:20:46,393 --> 00:20:49,871
How's about I just point it
out through the window for you?

369
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:51,456
Fine.

370
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:59,112
Get photos of everything here.

371
00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:00,573
I want a match on the location

372
00:21:00,574 --> 00:21:03,116
of every one of these
flowers on the property,

373
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:05,327
then get some soil samples.

374
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:07,204
What exactly are we looking for, Sheriff?

375
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:10,290
Shotgun shells, buckshot, traces of blood,

376
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,071
anything that proves this is the
real place where Branch got killed.

377
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:16,964
You think he was shot here?

378
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:19,484
Won't know for sure till
you get some samples.

379
00:21:24,055 --> 00:21:27,241
All the documents our client has
in connection with this pending suit

380
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:28,785
are on these drives.

381
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:31,162
I'm gonna be prepping
motions for discovery.

382
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:32,956
I need you all to backstop me.

383
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:35,733
Cady. We're lawyers.

384
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:38,026
We don't raise our hand. We interrupt.

385
00:21:38,027 --> 00:21:39,653
Right, sorry.

386
00:21:39,654 --> 00:21:42,322
It's just that we represent
Connally Enterprises?

387
00:21:42,323 --> 00:21:46,887
No, we're suing Connally Enterprises...
Barlow Connally, specifically.

388
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:48,429
Do you know him?

389
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:52,291
Well, um, I used to date his son, so...

390
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:53,751
[Kevin] Great.

391
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:56,104
You should be able to offer
some real insight into this.

392
00:21:58,715 --> 00:22:01,508
I just feel a little weird.

393
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:02,861
Cady.

394
00:22:02,928 --> 00:22:04,303
- Yeah.
- We're filing motions.

395
00:22:04,304 --> 00:22:06,722
It's not like you'll be facing
off against Barlow in court.

396
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:07,974
Oh. Good.

397
00:22:07,975 --> 00:22:10,058
And besides, if you recuse yourself

398
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:13,353
from every case in Absaroka County
where you know someone on the other side,

399
00:22:13,354 --> 00:22:15,957
you won't be able to practice law at all.

400
00:22:16,024 --> 00:22:18,418
This is life in a small town.

401
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:20,503
All right, next.

402
00:22:23,197 --> 00:22:26,408
Whoever fired that shot
must've been in this area, so...

403
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:28,160
[Vic] Hmm.

404
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:30,430
It's almost like you
know exactly where to go.

405
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,668
There aren't too many
spots it could've been.

406
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:39,212
Nighthorse would want to
suggest the shooter needed cover.

407
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:41,465
If it wasn't Nighthorse,

408
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:44,111
the highway's a few
hundred yards to the east.

409
00:22:44,177 --> 00:22:46,320
Someone could've walked
in from there, so...

410
00:22:49,057 --> 00:22:52,018
There's horse shit all over the place.

411
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:53,703
Maybe the shooter rode in.

412
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,396
Nighthorse got a horse?

413
00:22:56,397 --> 00:22:58,083
I think so.

414
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:06,174
Just do what I said and
call me back in an hour.

415
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:07,276
Okay.

416
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,864
Yeah, bye.

417
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:14,266
The company suing Barlow
is Big Pines Timber.

418
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:15,350
[Kevin] Yes.

419
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:17,937
Big Pines Timber is
owned by Jacob Nighthorse.

420
00:24:17,938 --> 00:24:20,581
Yes, we represent all of
Nighthorse's businesses.

421
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:25,277
- You look confused.
- I am.

422
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:28,697
The document that I just read said
that Nighthorse is suing Barlow Connally

423
00:24:28,698 --> 00:24:31,241
for breach of contract, but
those two are sworn enemies.

424
00:24:31,242 --> 00:24:33,678
What contract could they possibly have?

425
00:24:33,745 --> 00:24:36,622
They may not like each other, but
they have a number of business deals

426
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:38,582
through shell corporations...
or they did have.

427
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,351
This lawsuit might bring that to a close.

428
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:50,987
I quit.

429
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:55,307
What? Why?

430
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:57,101
Because of Barlow Connally?

431
00:24:57,102 --> 00:24:59,478
Look, I told you, you're
just support on this.

432
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:01,748
All right, look, if you're
really that uncomfortable...

433
00:25:01,815 --> 00:25:03,649
I am, but not because of Connally.

434
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,069
Because of Nighthorse and the casino.

435
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,488
I can't work for a firm
that represents the casino.

436
00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:11,949
[chuckles]

437
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,676
What's so funny?

438
00:25:13,743 --> 00:25:16,495
Only that the casino is
the reason you're here.

439
00:25:16,496 --> 00:25:18,705
Your success on the Standing Bear case,

440
00:25:18,706 --> 00:25:20,582
y-your connections to
the Native community,

441
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:21,935
your support of their causes...

442
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:25,545
You are the perfect person
to handle Reservation issues.

443
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:28,132
That's true... to a point.

444
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:30,151
I mean, you have to understand,

445
00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:35,031
my mother, she spent her last years
on this planet fighting the casino,

446
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:39,518
and for me to stay here and work for them,
it's a betrayal, and I'm... I'm sorry.

447
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,872
- I can't do it, so...
- Well.

448
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:45,083
Well, this is, uh...

449
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,002
unexpected.

450
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:51,321
I know. I'm so grateful.

451
00:25:51,322 --> 00:25:52,990
I was really excited about this job.

452
00:25:52,991 --> 00:25:55,742
- If you'd just told me...
- It's your responsibility

453
00:25:55,743 --> 00:25:58,554
to research a company you plan to work for.

454
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,124
Right.

455
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,583
I must've just gotten excited.

456
00:26:03,584 --> 00:26:05,418
Anyway, I'm really
sorry I wasted your time.

457
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:07,188
[Kevin] And our money.

458
00:26:07,255 --> 00:26:09,523
These were valuable, billable
hours you put in today.

459
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,817
I realize that.

460
00:26:10,884 --> 00:26:12,926
Then, why haven't you
packed your stuff and left,

461
00:26:12,927 --> 00:26:14,821
or are you trying to
waste more of our money?

462
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:17,949
- Okay.
- Not the pad.

463
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:20,184
That belongs to us.

464
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:21,410
This is mine.

465
00:26:21,477 --> 00:26:23,311
[chuckles]

466
00:26:23,312 --> 00:26:27,917
Normally, I wouldn't think it necessary
to remind another lawyer about this,

467
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:31,028
but clearly you're a
little green, so I will.

468
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:35,883
Everything that you read and
wrote in here today belongs to us.

469
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,053
You signed nondisclosure agreements
that couldn't be clearer on that matter.

470
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,997
So, you cannot take your
notes and you cannot discuss

471
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:45,685
anything you learned in
here today with anyone.

472
00:26:47,336 --> 00:26:51,715
So, if this whole act of yours
was designed to get you access

473
00:26:51,716 --> 00:26:56,803
to private information about the
casino your mommy didn't like,

474
00:26:56,804 --> 00:26:59,073
know that we will prosecute you,

475
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:05,997
and it is very hard to defend a
civil lawsuit on a waitress' salary.

476
00:27:07,941 --> 00:27:10,584
You can close the door behind you.

477
00:27:22,914 --> 00:27:25,124
Henry's friend from the
university rushed the tests

478
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,751
on those soil samples
from Nighthorse's house.

479
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:31,379
None of them matched the dirt
we found in the shotgun casing.

480
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,174
It's a totally different
mineral composition.

481
00:27:34,175 --> 00:27:37,904
And no traces of blood, lead, or gunpowder.

482
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,892
The only thing that was the same
was arrowleaf balsamwood pollen.

483
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:47,604
That was the head of the TSA unit at
the White Plains airport in New York.

484
00:27:47,605 --> 00:27:50,023
So, Nighthorse did land there
the night of Branch's murder,

485
00:27:50,024 --> 00:27:53,127
and he took a helicopter
out to the Foxwoods Casino.

486
00:27:53,194 --> 00:27:55,880
They're sending me the security
footage now to verify that.

487
00:27:57,324 --> 00:28:00,159
So, Nighthorse has a better
alibi for Branch's murder

488
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,369
than I do for shooting at Nighthorse.

489
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,388
[chuckles]

490
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:05,014
[clears throat]

491
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:06,682
Too soon?

492
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:12,171
Okay, so, uh, he has an alibi.

493
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:15,382
Doesn't Nighthorse usually get
someone else to do his dirty work?

494
00:28:15,383 --> 00:28:17,550
Yeah, he does, but David Ridges is dead,

495
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:20,488
and according to Henry,
Malachi's out of town, so...

496
00:28:20,554 --> 00:28:22,597
[Ferg] Hey, Sheriff.

497
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:24,891
Uh, while we're on the subject,

498
00:28:24,892 --> 00:28:28,687
I've been wondering about something...
about those surveillance cameras

499
00:28:28,688 --> 00:28:31,416
that you think were
stolen from Branch's house.

500
00:28:31,482 --> 00:28:35,277
Why would Nighthorse take them?

501
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:37,363
- I mean...
- You're thinking Nighthorse was the one

502
00:28:37,364 --> 00:28:40,157
who brought them to us
in the first place, so...

503
00:28:40,158 --> 00:28:43,535
Right, if he thought those cameras
had incriminating video on them,

504
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:45,930
why would he willingly turn them over?

505
00:28:45,997 --> 00:28:48,123
- It just doesn't make any sense.
- I know.

506
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:50,393
I know it doesn't make any sense, Ferg.

507
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:53,146
- Don't raise your voice at him, Walter.
- It's okay.

508
00:28:54,672 --> 00:28:56,149
Here you go.

509
00:28:57,633 --> 00:28:59,968
[sighs] What does Barlow want?

510
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:03,030
He left his phone in his wrecked SUV.

511
00:29:03,097 --> 00:29:06,784
You never filed any
paperwork about a wrecked SUV,

512
00:29:06,851 --> 00:29:08,935
so I didn't know what he was talking about.

513
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:10,979
I can get that phone for him.

514
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,748
Anything else?

515
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:14,542
They're on hold.

516
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:20,340
[clears throat]

517
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:24,410
- Tell them I'm not here.
- Walter.

518
00:29:24,411 --> 00:29:25,970
[Vic] Ruby.

519
00:29:26,954 --> 00:29:28,722
- Who's on hold?
- [door closes]

520
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:37,982
- Hey, honey.
- Hi.

521
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:40,175
[Vic] Hey. You just missed your dad.

522
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:43,053
Good. Actually, I, uh, kind
of wanted to talk to you.

523
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:44,304
- Me?
- Yeah.

524
00:29:44,305 --> 00:29:45,448
Really? Why?

525
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:47,849
I need some professional advice.

526
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,909
From me?

527
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:51,895
Have you ever been working on a
case and you got good information,

528
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:55,416
but the way you got that
information wasn't exactly legal?

529
00:29:55,483 --> 00:29:59,903
[sighs] This wouldn't happen to have
anything to do with your dad, would it?

530
00:29:59,904 --> 00:30:01,654
It might.

531
00:30:01,655 --> 00:30:04,074
Well, you're gonna have to
tell me what this is about.

532
00:30:04,075 --> 00:30:06,802
See, that's the problem. I-I can't.

533
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,599
Then, I can't help you. I
can't help anyone break the law.

534
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:13,726
[Cady] I'm trying not to break the law.

535
00:30:15,128 --> 00:30:17,104
[sighs] Look...

536
00:30:18,214 --> 00:30:21,859
All I can say is that I
may have found something

537
00:30:21,926 --> 00:30:24,278
that would give Nighthorse
motive in Branch's murder.

538
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:27,823
I think he was caught between two people.

539
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,992
What two people? Do we know them?

540
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:32,161
Okay, now I feel like
you're not really hearing me.

541
00:30:32,228 --> 00:30:33,395
Right, you can't tell me.

542
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:35,105
I signed a confidentiality agreement,

543
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:38,442
so anything that I say to anyone
can get thrown out in court,

544
00:30:38,443 --> 00:30:43,005
and I know my dad wants to do
this by the book, so what do I do?

545
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:44,656
You find another source.

546
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:47,033
I mean, you know the information already.

547
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:49,202
You just need to find a
different way to get it.

548
00:30:49,203 --> 00:30:52,456
A different way that you
can explain to a lawyer

549
00:30:52,457 --> 00:30:55,083
that doesn't violate whatever
confidentiality agreement

550
00:30:55,084 --> 00:30:56,477
you may have signed.

551
00:30:58,712 --> 00:31:01,190
Can you find another source?

552
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:06,261
[rock music plays]

553
00:31:06,262 --> 00:31:08,781
[Henry] So, this is a bit on the nose.

554
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:11,891
- What?
- A cop drowning his troubles

555
00:31:11,892 --> 00:31:14,245
and pouring out his soul
to the local tavern keeper.

556
00:31:14,312 --> 00:31:16,205
Yeah.

557
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:21,628
Except you're not really
the local tavern keeper here.

558
00:31:21,694 --> 00:31:23,588
Malachi is.

559
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:26,591
Also, you are not pouring out your
soul, and you are not drinking.

560
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:34,474
I need a new boot.

561
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:39,520
This is why you are upset?
Your boots are not comfortable?

562
00:31:43,216 --> 00:31:45,526
When I was eight or nine years old, my...

563
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:50,889
my mom got me some boots... nice ones.

564
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,617
I loved them.

565
00:31:52,683 --> 00:31:54,910
Six months in, my feet had grown.

566
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:58,480
My toes hurt.

567
00:31:58,481 --> 00:31:59,957
Actually had bruises on them.

568
00:32:02,527 --> 00:32:05,338
I kept wearing those boots.

569
00:32:05,405 --> 00:32:07,881
You never were the brightest child.

570
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:14,096
I'm doing it again.

571
00:32:15,956 --> 00:32:17,725
With Nighthorse.

572
00:32:20,086 --> 00:32:22,146
None of the evidence fits.

573
00:32:23,047 --> 00:32:26,025
Nothing says he killed
Branch except my gut.

574
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:30,946
I want to believe it.

575
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:36,035
- At a certain point...
- Your feet start to hurt.

576
00:32:38,187 --> 00:32:41,248
So, if it was not
Nighthorse who killed Branch,

577
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:43,900
who else could it be?

578
00:32:43,901 --> 00:32:47,505
And if the murder was not connected
to Ridges, what was it about?

579
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:52,760
I have absolutely no idea.

580
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:05,565
[Barlow] Hello, there.

581
00:33:05,632 --> 00:33:09,151
[sighs] Surprised me.

582
00:33:09,218 --> 00:33:10,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

583
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:13,740
- I was out back shoeing a horse.
- Oh.

584
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:16,283
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

585
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,411
Ah, good to see you, hon.

586
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:21,980
- What happened?
- Oh, that.

587
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:23,982
I had a little fender bender.

588
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:25,710
Your dad actually helped me out with it.

589
00:33:25,776 --> 00:33:28,796
- Do you want to come on inside?
- Yeah.

590
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:32,574
Want a cup of coffee or
anything? It's right here.

591
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:34,427
No, I'm... I'm good. Thank you.

592
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:40,641
[Barlow] So... what
brings you around, Cady?

593
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:44,061
Oh, um, I found some things
I thought you might like.

594
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:50,175
A picture and just some things
that Branch left at my house...

595
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:52,218
Nothing special.

596
00:33:52,219 --> 00:33:55,531
A mug, golf gloves.

597
00:33:56,307 --> 00:33:58,200
Nothing, really.

598
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:02,455
I appreciate it.

599
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:08,735
But I'm pretty sure he'd want
you to hang on to this stuff.

600
00:34:08,736 --> 00:34:09,878
Okay.

601
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,633
Are you sure?

602
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:16,510
You meant so much to him.

603
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,348
Yeah.

604
00:34:25,461 --> 00:34:28,481
So, how are you holding up?

605
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:31,758
[chuckles] I wish I could
say I was keeping it together,

606
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:34,654
but it hasn't been easy.

607
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:36,656
You must really miss him.

608
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:40,951
Especially since Branch just
started working with you.

609
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:46,064
Must've been nice to have
him right there beside you.

610
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:48,334
Yeah, it was kind of a dream come true.

611
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:49,418
I bet.

612
00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:55,215
What was he doing for
you anyway, work-wise?

613
00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:02,055
I would've thought he'd told you that.

614
00:35:06,001 --> 00:35:09,188
To be honest, Branch and I
hadn't really been communicating.

615
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:12,650
We broke up a month before he died.

616
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:16,445
Oh.

617
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,659
I didn't realize.

618
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:25,228
Yeah.

619
00:35:25,229 --> 00:35:28,332
So, you and Branch weren't together?

620
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:30,751
No.

621
00:35:32,653 --> 00:35:35,280
I-I'm sorry I didn't
tell you at the funeral.

622
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:38,843
It just didn't seem like the time.

623
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:40,577
And it's not exactly true

624
00:35:40,578 --> 00:35:42,596
that there wasn't any
communication between us.

625
00:35:42,663 --> 00:35:46,975
He sent me a bunch of texts
the night before Dad found him.

626
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:50,563
But...

627
00:35:53,591 --> 00:35:54,859
But what?

628
00:35:56,051 --> 00:35:57,986
[Cady] I don't know.

629
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:02,115
They... You know, the
texts were kind of crazy.

630
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:10,565
Yeah, he... He sent me some texts, too.

631
00:36:10,566 --> 00:36:12,793
I just figured he'd been drinking.

632
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:15,713
So I didn't do anything.

633
00:36:18,073 --> 00:36:20,575
- If only I...
- Barlow.

634
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:24,722
If you've spoken to my dad, you know
that Branch did not commit suicide.

635
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,810
There's nothing you could've done.

636
00:36:31,128 --> 00:36:33,021
Well, maybe he didn't kill himself,

637
00:36:33,088 --> 00:36:35,733
but I still think I could've stopped him.

638
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:41,363
Stopped him from doing what?

639
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,853
I think Branch got himself all worked
up, emotional, and confronted Nighthorse.

640
00:36:47,854 --> 00:36:51,665
Why? I mean, what would
Branch know about Nighthorse?

641
00:36:53,984 --> 00:36:56,068
I don't know.

642
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:59,298
Probably something about
this David Ridges business.

643
00:37:00,658 --> 00:37:04,536
Well, it's... probably not any comfort,

644
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:08,915
but now that my dad knows
that he didn't commit suicide,

645
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:12,436
he won't rest until he figures it out.

646
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,153
[Walt] Aah!

647
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:40,172
Ruby said you'd be
here... dodging the feds.

648
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:41,590
[sighs]

649
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:45,785
I was just getting Barlow his phone back.

650
00:37:45,786 --> 00:37:48,287
Really just a one-person job, so...

651
00:37:48,288 --> 00:37:51,391
Yeah, well, I needed to talk to you, so...

652
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,585
Cady came by.

653
00:37:53,586 --> 00:37:55,837
She said that she found out
something about Nighthorse

654
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:58,339
that would explain why
he'd want to kill Branch,

655
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,527
but she can't reveal it
without breaking the law, so...

656
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:06,973
I am just gonna ask you... Did you
find out something about Nighthorse

657
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:09,100
when you shot at him and
you're making your daughter

658
00:38:09,101 --> 00:38:11,436
- launder the information for you?
- Vic, listen to me...

659
00:38:11,437 --> 00:38:17,400
Before you deny it, I found this
on the hill at Nighthorse's house.

660
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:19,110
It was on the ground

661
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:21,380
right around where the
shooter would've been standing.

662
00:38:31,582 --> 00:38:34,643
I will... I will lie for you.

663
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,419
It's what I came here to tell you.

664
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,589
I'll say whatever you want me to say.

665
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,859
I just need you to tell me
what the hell's going on.

666
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,239
I told you already.

667
00:38:48,056 --> 00:38:49,867
I will never ask you to lie for me.

668
00:38:51,811 --> 00:38:55,414
The last person to accuse me
with an empty beer can was Branch.

669
00:38:56,899 --> 00:39:00,044
He was wrong then just
like you're wrong now.

670
00:39:01,194 --> 00:39:04,423
I was at home that night. That's the truth.

671
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:08,618
- Why wouldn't you just tell me that?
- Because you weren't ready to listen.

672
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:11,555
Everything I said
would've seemed like a lie.

673
00:39:18,629 --> 00:39:24,342
Well, if that's the case, then someone
left that can there to frame you,

674
00:39:24,343 --> 00:39:26,361
someone who knows that you drink Rainier.

675
00:39:26,428 --> 00:39:28,155
Yep.

676
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,077
So, what did Cady discover?

677
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:37,664
[sighs] That Branch was
caught between two people.

678
00:39:37,731 --> 00:39:39,858
What two people?

679
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:41,877
She refused to tell me.

680
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:50,952
So, tell me what you
found out about Branch.

681
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:52,119
Wow.

682
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,597
Thanks, Vic.

683
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:55,498
Some secrets you don't keep.

684
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:57,667
- This one I have to.
- Why?

685
00:39:57,668 --> 00:40:00,169
- Who are you protecting?
- Myself.

686
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,464
Dad, I signed a confidentiality agreement.

687
00:40:03,465 --> 00:40:06,801
I got a job at a new law firm.

688
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:08,053
- You got a job?
- Yeah.

689
00:40:08,054 --> 00:40:10,304
- That's great.
- It is great.

690
00:40:10,305 --> 00:40:12,557
It's the best job I'll
ever find in this county,

691
00:40:12,558 --> 00:40:15,142
and I already quit.

692
00:40:15,143 --> 00:40:18,063
I had to. The firm wasn't
what I thought it was.

693
00:40:18,064 --> 00:40:20,231
I-I didn't like who they represented.

694
00:40:20,232 --> 00:40:22,292
They represent Nighthorse.

695
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:24,837
[laughs] I can't say.

696
00:40:24,904 --> 00:40:27,238
Anything that I say to you,

697
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:30,634
they'll presume that I'm violating
my agreement, and they will sue me.

698
00:40:31,243 --> 00:40:33,119
And you found something.

699
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,805
Maybe.

700
00:40:34,872 --> 00:40:36,789
I tried to get the
information a different way

701
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,934
so that I wasn't violating my agreement.

702
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,477
How'd you do that?

703
00:40:42,129 --> 00:40:43,922
I went to talk to Barlow.

704
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:45,965
What did you think you
were gonna get from Barlow?

705
00:40:45,966 --> 00:40:48,467
Dad, please don't make me
do the wrong thing here.

706
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:51,488
Why does everybody keep saying I'm
trying to make them do the wrong thing?

707
00:40:51,555 --> 00:40:53,406
Because I know how much this means to you.

708
00:40:55,684 --> 00:40:57,744
It means a lot to me, too.

709
00:40:57,811 --> 00:41:01,106
Cady, what did you and Barlow talk about?

710
00:41:01,107 --> 00:41:03,209
You can tell me that.

711
00:41:06,862 --> 00:41:09,339
We talked about his car accident

712
00:41:09,406 --> 00:41:14,243
and about the crazy texts that Branch
sent both of us the night before he died.

713
00:41:14,244 --> 00:41:16,203
We talked about David Ridges,

714
00:41:16,204 --> 00:41:18,706
and I came clean about the
fact that Branch and I broke up.

715
00:41:18,707 --> 00:41:22,811
And we talked about everything except
the thing I wanted to talk about.

716
00:41:25,923 --> 00:41:27,274
So...

717
00:41:28,926 --> 00:41:31,636
Branch sent all those texts to Barlow, too?

718
00:41:31,637 --> 00:41:32,971
Yeah.

719
00:41:32,972 --> 00:41:36,575
He said he thought Branch had been
drinking and went after Nighthorse.

720
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:45,125
[scoffs]

721
00:41:50,864 --> 00:41:52,925
- [knock on door]
- [Walt] Barlow.

722
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:04,644
Barlow?

723
00:42:09,008 --> 00:42:10,483
Hello?

724
00:42:41,456 --> 00:42:43,267
[sighs]

725
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:37,570
[spits]

726
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:25,869
[engine shuts off]

727
00:44:40,826 --> 00:44:43,178
[boards creak]

728
00:44:43,245 --> 00:44:45,264
[horse snorts]

729
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:15,961
[piano notes play]

730
00:45:16,028 --> 00:45:17,796
- [hinges creak]
- [Barlow] Door was open.

731
00:45:18,905 --> 00:45:21,467
You really ought to keep
it locked, even out here.

732
00:45:26,621 --> 00:45:28,289
I could've shot you, Barlow.

733
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:30,749
Nah, you got good instincts, Walt.

734
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,752
I had no idea you played piano.

735
00:45:33,753 --> 00:45:37,232
Well, I don't play it much anymore, so...

736
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,592
You rode over?

737
00:45:40,593 --> 00:45:43,696
Well, you took my keys. [chuckles]

738
00:45:45,057 --> 00:45:46,391
Your horse need water?

739
00:45:46,392 --> 00:45:48,351
[Barlow] No, she's fine.

740
00:45:48,352 --> 00:45:50,120
How about you?

741
00:45:50,187 --> 00:45:52,539
You twist my arm, I'll take a bourbon.

742
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,252
[Walt sighs]

743
00:45:58,987 --> 00:46:01,089
[sighs]

744
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:06,219
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?

745
00:46:07,746 --> 00:46:10,640
[Barlow] Well, I'm not sure
it's gonna be a pleasure.

746
00:46:10,707 --> 00:46:14,210
I came over here to confess to something.

747
00:46:14,211 --> 00:46:17,504
But I'm sure you already figured it out.

748
00:46:17,505 --> 00:46:18,606
Out of bourbon.

749
00:46:20,259 --> 00:46:21,527
So...

750
00:46:25,472 --> 00:46:26,406
[sighs]

751
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:30,059
Tell me what you did, Barlow. [sighs]

752
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,372
Well... it's not like I planned it.

753
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:38,001
I just found myself there with
a gun in my hand, and, uh...

754
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:43,089
I shot at Nighthorse.

755
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:45,675
Why?

756
00:46:45,742 --> 00:46:49,137
Son of a bitch killed my
son. You said so yourself.

757
00:46:50,247 --> 00:46:52,664
Well, you, uh...

758
00:46:52,665 --> 00:46:55,209
caused a real problem for me, Barlow.

759
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:57,169
Nighthorse thinks I'm
the one that shot at him.

760
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:00,607
[Barlow] Well, that's what I'm
doing here. I want to come clean.

761
00:47:00,673 --> 00:47:03,092
I'm prepared to face the consequences.

762
00:47:03,093 --> 00:47:07,221
Well, I understand wanting to take out
the man that killed the person I love,

763
00:47:07,222 --> 00:47:10,033
but that's not what happened here.

764
00:47:11,518 --> 00:47:13,352
Now, why would I make that up?

765
00:47:13,353 --> 00:47:16,039
[Walt] Well, I know you shot at him.

766
00:47:16,106 --> 00:47:17,832
But you're lying about why.

767
00:47:19,067 --> 00:47:20,627
You're a pretty good shot, Barlow.

768
00:47:20,693 --> 00:47:24,613
You wouldn't have missed him twice
if you were trying to hit him, no.

769
00:47:24,614 --> 00:47:27,450
No, that wasn't about revenge.

770
00:47:27,451 --> 00:47:30,637
You were trying to miss him, pin it on me.

771
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:34,224
That's why you left the Rainier can behind.

772
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:35,500
[chuckles]

773
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:37,709
I think that beer's gone
straight to your head.

774
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,271
[Walt chuckles]

775
00:47:43,216 --> 00:47:44,734
[sighs]

776
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:49,406
You even used a gun the
same caliber as my rifle.

777
00:47:51,975 --> 00:47:53,952
Even I was starting to think I'd done it.

778
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:55,703
[can clatters]

779
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,062
You're crazy.

780
00:47:57,063 --> 00:47:58,873
[Walt] Why frame me, Barlow?

781
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:02,544
Unless you're trying to take my focus
off investigating Branch's murder.

782
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,003
Why would I want to do that?

783
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:06,798
Because you don't want me to
find out who was really behind it.

784
00:48:06,865 --> 00:48:09,134
We already know who was behind it.

785
00:48:09,201 --> 00:48:12,304
Well, whoever it was knew Branch well.

786
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:16,790
Knew where he hid his key.
Knew how to get into his house.

787
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:21,854
He typed a suicide note on his
computer that sounded like Branch.

788
00:48:21,921 --> 00:48:23,797
With one exception.

789
00:48:23,798 --> 00:48:27,611
They didn't know that Branch and my
daughter had broken up a few weeks ago.

790
00:48:29,513 --> 00:48:33,575
I understand Cady came by
and broke the news to you.

791
00:48:36,686 --> 00:48:39,872
You think a father could kill his own son?

792
00:48:41,525 --> 00:48:44,336
You really think I'm capable of that?

793
00:48:46,613 --> 00:48:48,298
Well, I didn't before today.

794
00:48:50,742 --> 00:48:55,763
But you told Cady you got some texts
from Branch the night before he died.

795
00:48:56,915 --> 00:48:58,600
Well, uh...

796
00:49:01,294 --> 00:49:04,755
I looked on your phone, and
not only did you get no texts

797
00:49:04,756 --> 00:49:08,092
from him that night, but,
uh, over the past year,

798
00:49:08,093 --> 00:49:10,028
you barely texted at all.

799
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,306
Well, I'm just like you.
I'm not much of a texter.

800
00:49:14,307 --> 00:49:17,994
Well, actually, you are.

801
00:49:18,061 --> 00:49:22,457
You wrote all those texts
to Cady from Branch's phone.

802
00:49:22,524 --> 00:49:27,045
You did everything you could
to make it look like a suicide.

803
00:49:27,112 --> 00:49:29,655
You drove Branch's truck back to his house.

804
00:49:29,656 --> 00:49:32,133
You wrote a note on his computer.

805
00:49:32,992 --> 00:49:35,411
You got his uniform,

806
00:49:35,412 --> 00:49:37,413
staged that whole thing down by the river

807
00:49:37,414 --> 00:49:42,268
where the water would wash
away anything you overlooked.

808
00:49:45,505 --> 00:49:47,899
How'd you get yourself
home from there, Barlow?

809
00:49:48,634 --> 00:49:50,985
I didn't see any signs of
your horse down at the river.

810
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:56,491
I guess you could've used that, uh,
mountain bike I saw at your house.

811
00:49:57,517 --> 00:50:00,119
Oh, anyway, I...

812
00:50:00,186 --> 00:50:02,038
I got to hand it to you.

813
00:50:02,105 --> 00:50:04,082
You thought of everything.

814
00:50:04,149 --> 00:50:06,752
Really, your only mistake...

815
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:10,505
was the shotgun.

816
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:16,344
After you shot Branch,
you ejected the shell,

817
00:50:16,411 --> 00:50:18,054
just... just out of instinct.

818
00:50:19,498 --> 00:50:22,916
You didn't realize when you
put it back in the weapon

819
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:28,690
there was dirt inside
the shell. And pollen.

820
00:50:30,342 --> 00:50:33,528
Pollen from flowers I
found on your property.

821
00:50:38,141 --> 00:50:43,496
Well, I got to hand it to you, Walt.
You are one sharp son of a bitch.

822
00:50:43,563 --> 00:50:46,499
You seem to have an answer for everything.

823
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,631
Well, not everything.

824
00:50:54,032 --> 00:50:56,384
I still don't know why.

825
00:50:57,452 --> 00:50:59,596
Why you would kill your own son.

826
00:51:02,582 --> 00:51:04,875
Because he wasn't my
son, you son of a bitch.

827
00:51:04,876 --> 00:51:06,168
That's why!

828
00:51:06,169 --> 00:51:10,106
Now, he might've had my genes,
but he didn't have my character.

829
00:51:10,173 --> 00:51:14,068
He had no... no sense of loyalty about him.

830
00:51:14,135 --> 00:51:17,823
Even after he started working for
me, he was still working for you!

831
00:51:19,474 --> 00:51:21,075
Working for me?

832
00:51:21,142 --> 00:51:22,828
Yeah.

833
00:51:22,894 --> 00:51:24,496
On what?

834
00:51:24,563 --> 00:51:27,999
Well, if you don't know, I'm
sure as hell not gonna tell you.

835
00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:43,264
You took those cameras from Branch's house.

836
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:48,936
All this while, I thought...

837
00:51:49,796 --> 00:51:53,424
Branch found out something about
Nighthorse on those surveillance cameras,

838
00:51:53,425 --> 00:51:55,026
but it was you.

839
00:51:55,802 --> 00:51:57,445
It was you.

840
00:51:58,137 --> 00:52:02,701
He was surveilling Nighthorse, but
he found out something about you.

841
00:52:02,768 --> 00:52:04,226
[chuckles]

842
00:52:04,227 --> 00:52:08,063
Oh, he was a smart boy. Yeah.

843
00:52:08,064 --> 00:52:10,041
He discovered it weeks before you did.

844
00:52:14,446 --> 00:52:19,533
And my daughter figured
it out earlier today.

845
00:52:19,534 --> 00:52:20,802
She...

846
00:52:22,704 --> 00:52:26,582
Branch got caught between
you and Nighthorse.

847
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:30,395
You two aren't enemies.
You're... You're working together.

848
00:52:30,462 --> 00:52:31,587
[chuckles]

849
00:52:31,588 --> 00:52:34,381
Your real-estate developments,
your golf course...

850
00:52:34,382 --> 00:52:36,359
None of that pays off
without a lot of people.

851
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:44,158
People that Nighthorse's casino will bring.

852
00:52:44,225 --> 00:52:47,995
That Indian had a lot of
good ideas, not much capital.

853
00:52:52,776 --> 00:52:57,630
My wife and I... were in your way.

854
00:52:57,697 --> 00:53:02,051
You know what the definition
of a conservationist is, Walt?

855
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:06,955
That's somebody who's
already got his own land

856
00:53:06,956 --> 00:53:09,374
and tries to squash everybody else's chance

857
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,769
of getting some of their own.

858
00:53:10,836 --> 00:53:12,753
You and your wife were living out here

859
00:53:12,754 --> 00:53:18,276
and just killing everybody else's chance
of making some money for themselves.

860
00:53:21,471 --> 00:53:22,655
You...

861
00:53:24,015 --> 00:53:25,909
and Nighthorse...

862
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:30,288
killed her.

863
00:53:30,355 --> 00:53:32,939
That's what Branch thought to begin with.

864
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,025
[sighs]

865
00:53:35,026 --> 00:53:37,879
David Ridges killed your wife.

866
00:53:37,945 --> 00:53:40,298
On whose orders?

867
00:53:45,203 --> 00:53:46,846
Mine.

868
00:53:48,498 --> 00:53:51,476
I had worked too hard and too long

869
00:53:51,543 --> 00:53:55,021
to let you and that bitch
wife of yours stand in my way.

870
00:53:55,087 --> 00:53:56,815
Why didn't you just kill me?

871
00:53:56,882 --> 00:53:58,965
Oh, no.

872
00:53:58,966 --> 00:54:01,193
That would've drawn too much attention.

873
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,489
So, when you couldn't get at me...

874
00:54:06,641 --> 00:54:08,726
you went after the thing I loved.

875
00:54:08,727 --> 00:54:10,536
[Barlow] Oh, come on, Walt.

876
00:54:12,355 --> 00:54:14,415
Martha had cancer.

877
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:16,960
She was already dead.

878
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:20,880
Now, what did I do?

879
00:54:20,947 --> 00:54:25,844
Shorten her life by a few
weeks? Maybe a few months.

880
00:54:28,204 --> 00:54:32,958
I'll see you rot for this for
the rest of your miserable life.

881
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,585
No, you won't.

882
00:54:34,586 --> 00:54:36,479
This is my county.

883
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:40,424
There's no way that I'm
gonna let you lock me up.

884
00:54:40,425 --> 00:54:43,194
Nobody is taking me from my rightful home.

885
00:54:44,136 --> 00:54:45,655
Drop the gun!

886
00:54:49,601 --> 00:54:51,577
[pistol clicking]

887
00:54:57,901 --> 00:55:01,295
[sighs] You just shot a defenseless man.

888
00:55:03,907 --> 00:55:09,411
You invited me to your cabin and
then you killed me. [chuckles]

889
00:55:09,412 --> 00:55:12,623
You're not gonna die, you son of a bitch.

890
00:55:12,624 --> 00:55:14,433
I won't let you.

891
00:55:16,461 --> 00:55:17,878
Not gonna let you... Get up!

892
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:19,087
- Let me go.
- Get up!

893
00:55:19,088 --> 00:55:21,799
- Aah!
- Come on!

894
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,985
They're gonna sew you up,

895
00:55:24,051 --> 00:55:26,654
and you're gonna have to
live with what you've done!

896
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:44,863
I... [breathing heavily]

897
00:55:44,864 --> 00:55:47,282
I'm not going to a hospital.

898
00:55:47,283 --> 00:55:49,343
You just let me die, Walt.

899
00:55:51,245 --> 00:55:53,305
You know you want to.

900
00:55:54,248 --> 00:55:56,959
I killed my own son.

901
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,519
Aah!

902
00:56:00,755 --> 00:56:03,691
I killed him! [grunts]

903
00:56:22,735 --> 00:56:23,836
[Barlow laughs]

904
00:56:23,903 --> 00:56:26,380
Good luck explaining this one, Walt.

905
00:56:27,573 --> 00:56:29,658
[grunts]

906
00:56:29,659 --> 00:56:31,510
I'll be ready.

907
00:56:36,082 --> 00:56:38,101
And you'll be in hell.

908
00:56:45,633 --> 00:56:47,485
[grunts]

909
00:56:49,721 --> 00:56:52,323
[breathing heavily]

910
