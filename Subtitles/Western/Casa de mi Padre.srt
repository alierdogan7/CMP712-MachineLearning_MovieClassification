00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,341
Do you ride?

187
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,472
I haven't in a long time,

188
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,889
but I would like to.

189
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,394
- Esteban, please check on the herd.
- Yes.

190
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,393
- I shall meet you there later.
- Of course.

191
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,349
You ride well, Miss Lopez.

192
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,939
Good control, nice poise.

193
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,143
That is a difficult horse.

194
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,773
You have ridden before.

195
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,399
From the time I could walk,
my father put me on the back of a horse.

196
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,234
I see.

197
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,409
When I was nine,
my father was murdered in his bed.

198
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,911
They took me to the city
to live with my uncle.

199
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,162
Interesting.

200
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,335
My uncle was very mean.

201
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,541
He drank rubbing alcohol, and he hit me
and burned me with his cigarettes.

202
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,841
Interesting.

203
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,467
I ran away from him when I was 12.

204
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,850
But he found me, and beat me, and said
he would marry me when I was grown up.

205
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,303
Interesting.

206
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,438
And your uncle?

207
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,439
I have not seen him in a long time.

208
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,567
I have to ask you something.

209
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,364
Do you love Raul?

210
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:10,163
Raul has been very good to me,
and I have been good to him.

211
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,408
Do you love him?

212
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,959
I must know.

213
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:22,088
A race. I will show you how well I ride!
Giddy up!

214
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,135
Not if I can help it!

215
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,675
(ARMANDO LAUGHS)

216
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,533
This is beautiful.

217
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,165
What is this place?

218
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,751
It is called.

219
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,380
The Pond of the Seven Tears.

220
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,132
I swam here as a boy.

221
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:16,187
It is the most beautiful spot
I have seen in all my life.

222
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,724
How did you know to ride here?

223
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,940
The wind told me.

224
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,109
Sometimes the wind talks to me.

225
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,987
This is the place my mother was killed.

226
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,697
This was her favorite place.

227
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,415
I have much work to do.

228
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,841
Go then. I am only drying my hair.

229
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,634
Okay, but do not be long.

230
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,587
There are bandits in these hills.

231
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,014
Armando will protect me.

232
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,432
Ah. Yes.

233
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,308
My son,

234
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,560
this was my father's rifle.

235
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:04,148
He passed it on to me when I was a boy,

236
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,775
and today I am giving it to you.

237
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,326
Go. You must build our ranch.

238
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,250
Armando.

239
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,298
What do you want?

240
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,833
Armando, give me the gun.

241
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,136
- Boy, give me the gun!
- No.

242
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,681
No! Let me go! No!

243
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,390
Go! Don't touch me!

244
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,704
ARMANDO: She loved coming here.

245
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,245
I am sorry.

246
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,292
It was a long time ago.

247
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,126
I could stay here forever.

248
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,838
I doubt that very much.

249
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,052
Why is that?

250
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,129
(LAUGHS)

251
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,799
There is nothing to buy.

252
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,429
No shops,

253
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,386
no expensive clothes,

254
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,346
no fancy shoes.

255
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,102
(LAUGHS)

256
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,400
This is not Dallas.

257
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,318
Is that what you think of me?

258
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,193
Someone who needs fancy shoes?

259
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:35,318
It does not matter what I think of you.

260
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:40,164
You think I'm some kind of cheap woman
who is only interested in Raul's money?

261
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,741
Are you?

262
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,296
You never answered my question.

263
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,259
What question?

264
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,883
Do you love my brother?

265
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,555
Take me back, now!

266
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,132
Answer the question!

00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,060
- Congas?
- Guns.

270
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,388
Where?

271
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,814
Over that hill.

272
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:05,890
Hunters?

273
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,725
Those are not hunters.

274
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,027
Perhaps someone is hurt.

275
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,979
It is not our concern.

276
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,695
You are a coward. A coward!

277
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,569

278
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,746
No!

00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,213
Sir? Sir?

280
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,842
Please... God forgive me.

281
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,472
Easy. We'll take you to the hospital.

282
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,352
Let him die.

283
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,604
He is missing a hand.

284

Give me your water, Armando.

285
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,155
Waste water on that?

286
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,737
In the trunk. It's in the trunk.

287
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,035
Take it...

288
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,741
Here, take this.

289
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,006
I know you.

Armando, please help me put him
on the horse.

00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,305
He is coming.

The Onza.

295

Maybe God will be merciful.

296

He is dead!

297
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,489

It looks like these belong to you now.

You are a rich woman.

300
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,881
Don't you want them?

301
00:22:53,956 --> 00:23:00,384

from an old dying friend?

You do not love my brother.

305
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,986
Let me go. You're hurting me.

306
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,689
I don't think you hurt so easily.

I know that you will not marry Raul
if I can help it.

Do you think Raul is so innocent?

311

Are you so sure
that Raul is involved with drugs?

I don't know, Manuel.

00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:33,681
I have sensed something since his return,

323
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,813
and this morning with Sonia...

324
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,442
Perhaps she is lying. Bitches are liars.

325
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:44,025
It is true. Bitches are liars.

326
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,736
But Miss Lopez is no bitch.

You are in the drug business.

I am in business in Mexico, Armando.

No, Armando. I am here to save this family.

I do not sell drugs to my people.

345
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,369
I sell it to the Americans.

346
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,750
I don't sell drugs to our people.
No, no, no.

347
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,003
I sell the Americans drugs, but I'd sell
them chocolates if they wanted them.

This is a country of babies.

351

They buy houses with no money.

someone who many of you have often
called stupid, imbecile, fat head,

555

You aren't going to toast
to your brother's happiness?

He will never stop until
he has what he wants.

This is Raul's woman.

750

with this dirty rancher'?

on your brother's woman.

That's a good one too!

762
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,993

932
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:01,773
You are under arrest for murder

and the trafficking of illegal drugs.

934
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,071
You will be extradited
to the United States,

935
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:08,739
where you will stand trial.

936
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,987
No, Mr. Blancardo,

937
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,152
there will be no trial.

938
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:15,621

The greasy wetback shot him.

01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:32,054
It's a goddamn Mexican standoff.

944

Not all Mexicans are drug dealers.

Are you ready, Sonia?

952
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,132
Yes.

01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:18,468

Hi, I'm Dan Haggerty.

You know, if you ask me,
nature is pretty damn cool.

990
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:50,075
You got trees, you got water,
you got more trees.

But there is nothing better,
and I mean, nothing better,

992

than a cool Haggerty Smoke.

993
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:58,330
Haggerty Smokes give me
exactly what I'm looking for,

994
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,498
and that's a kickass buzz.

995
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:03,964
You can get Haggerty Smokes
in your grocer's freezer department.

996
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:07,293
So you pick up yourself a pack,
they're totally tobacco free,

997
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:09,169
I wouldn't worry about the legalities,

998
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:11,255
and the next time you're out in nature,

999
01:24:11,338 --> 01:24:13,386
look me up and let's get buzzed together.
