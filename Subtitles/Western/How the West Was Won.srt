NARRATOR: This land has a name today
and is marked on maps.

2
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:10,823
But the names and the marks and the land
all had to be won.

3
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,451
Won from nature and from primitive man.

4
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:20,749
Five generations ago,
a mere 1 25 years back...

5
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,961
...this land was known
only as the West.

6
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,506
Known only to a handful of white men...

7
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:32,428
...lonely trappers wandering its vastness
in search of beaver.

8
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,681
They were known as mountain men,
a new breed.

9
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,769
Men like Jim Bridger,
Franchère and Sublette, Linus Rawlings.

10
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,356
More lndian than the Indians
in all but blood.

11
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,484
They held to no law but their own...

12
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:53,240
...drifted free as the clouds,
settled nowhere, kept forever on the move.

13
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:59,246
Their mocassined feet and unshod horses
leaving no trace on the land.

14
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,459
Like the Indians,
with whom they were at peace...

15
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:08,130
...they wanted nothing beyond
what they found, and little of that.

16
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,801
The mountains, the forests,
the harsh country...

17
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,472
...were as unchanging to them
as the stars...

18
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,350
...and just as unyielding.

19
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:25,064
Far behind the mountains,
beyond the rolling plains...

20
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:30,945
...they had left the people of the East,
people who were restless in another way.

21
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,990
The kind who'd look at a mountain
and see a watershed...

22
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,451
...look at a forest
and see lumber for houses...

23
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,329
...look at a stony field and see a farm.

24
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,583
Their faces and their instincts
had been turned to the West...

25
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,836
...ever since Plymouth Rock
and Jamestown.

26
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:52,091
The trapper's road was the trail
of a wolf or the bend of a canyon.

27
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,761
But for whole families
chaffing to follow the sun...

28
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,472
...there had to be broader ways.

29
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,185
There were no roads into the wilderness,
only rivers.

30
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,397
And they flowed in the wrong direction:
north or south.

31
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,692
Or else they stopped at the Alleghenies.

32
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:16,615
Until one day, a new river took source
in the mind of a man named DeWitt Clinton.

33
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,202
He conceived of a river
that would go west.

34
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,708
And in the way Americans have
of acting out their dreams, it came to be.

35
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,544
The Erie Canal left the Hudson
above Albany...

36
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:32,172
...and carried clear across
to the Great Lakes.

37
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,718

and a new life...

38
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,220
...now had a highway to take them.

39
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,972
