00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,080
You'd better get yourself
set for another one...

344
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,920
...because when I holler, I
want you to move out in a hurry!

345
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,360

350

SAM: I'm gonna tell 'em, Ethan.
ETHAN: Let's tell 'em!

351
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,440
MARTIN: Take it easy, Nesby.
BRAD: You'll be all right, Nesby.

352
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,040
ETHAN: Come on!

353
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,160

Here is my Bible. Hold it.
It'll make you feel good.

357
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,360
Thank you, Reverend.
Thank you very kindly.

[Chanting and drumbeat continue]

359
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,920
Do you think they'll charge us?

360
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
- Are you asking me?
- I am.

361
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,200
Well, thank you.

362
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,440
Yep. The Death Song.

363
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,800
The War Chief. He's
got to, to save face.

364
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,240
Yes, sir. He'll be right in
your lap in a minute, sonny.

365
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,160
For that which we're about to
receive, we thank Thee, O Lord.

366
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,280

You got him, Marty!

371
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,840
Hallelujah!

372
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,280
Dang! Blast it!

373
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,560
Watch it, it's loaded!

374
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,520
[Gunshot echoes]

375
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,920
Leave them to carry
off their hurt and dead.

376
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,200
Well, Reverend, that does it!

377
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,440
From now on, you stay out of this,
all of you! I don't want you with me.

378
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,840
ETHAN: I don't need you
for what I've gotta do!

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,600
[Thunderous gunshot]

380
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,680
Well, Edwards, I guess you're right.

381
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,160
We gotta get Nesby back.

382
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,600
This is a job for a whole
company of rangers...

383
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,840
...or it's a job for one or two men.

384
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,920
Right now, we're too
many and not enough.

385
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,680
ETHAN: Me, I'm going on alone.

386
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,720
Any objections?

387
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,000
Good luck.

388
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,200
There's only one way you can stop
me from looking for Lucy, mister...

389
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,840
...and that's kill me!

390
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,600
That's the way I feel, Uncle Ethan.

391
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,880
Ethan. Sir.

392
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,000
ETHAN: All right.
But I'm giving the orders, you hear?

393
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,960
I'm givin' the orders...

394
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,920
...and you'll follow 'em or we're
splittin' up right here and now.

395
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,400
Sure, Ethan.

396
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,240
There's just one reason we're here,
ain't it? It's to find Debbie and Lucy.

397
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,360
If they're still alive.

398
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,920
ETHAN: Mount up.

399
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,800
They gotta stop sometime.

400
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,360
If they're human men
at all, they gotta stop!

401
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,160
No, a human rides a horse until
it dies, then he goes on afoot.

402
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,160
A Comanche comes along, gets that
horse up, rides him 20 more miles...

403
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,000
...and then he eats him.

404
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,120
Easy on that!

405
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Sorry.

406
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,480
We don't even know if Debbie
and Lucy are in this bunch.

407
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,600
Maybe they split up.

408
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,960
They're with 'em, all right.
If they're still alive.

409
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,880
You've said that enough!

410
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,840
Maybe Lucy's dead.
Maybe they're both dead.

411
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,600
But, if I hear that from you
again, I'll fight you, Mr. Edwards!

412
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,400
That'll be the day!

413
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,600
Spread out!

414
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,680
Found a main trail, but...

415
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,800
...four of them cut out here
and rode on up through that pass.

416
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,040
BRAD: How come they'd do that, Ethan?

417
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,080
I'll take a look. Keep after the others.

418
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,920
If you want us to fire...

419
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,680
No, nor build bonfires, nor beat drums.

420
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,280
I'll meet you on the far side.

421
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,280
ETHAN: [Voice echoing] Move!

422
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,120
MARTIN: Do you want some water, Ethan?

423
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,120
The trail leads over there.

424
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,000
Why'd they break off?

425
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,320
Was there water in that canyon?

426
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,440
Huh?

427
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,600
No water.

428
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,720
Are you all right, Ethan?

429
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
ETHAN: I'm all right.

430
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,800
MARTIN: What happened to your coat?
Did you lose it?

431
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,320
ETHAN: I must have.

432
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,080
But I'm not going back for it!

433
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,800
BRAD: I found 'em! I found Lucy!

434
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,160
They're camped a half-mile over. I was
swinging back and I saw their smoke.

435
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,840
Bellied up a ridge, and there
they were, right below me.

436
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,840
Did you see Debbie?

437
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,680
No, but I saw Lucy all right.
She was wearing that blue dress...

438
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,920
What you saw wasn't Lucy.

439
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,200
Oh, but it was...

440
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,040
What you saw was a buck...

441
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,920
...wearin' Lucy's dress.

442
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,440
I found Lucy back in the canyon.

443
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,200
I wrapped her in my coat.

444
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Buried her with my own hands.

445
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,840
ETHAN: I thought it best
to keep it from you.

446
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,920
Did they...

447
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,680
Was she...?

448
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,280
What do you want me to do? Draw
you a picture? Spell it out?

449
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,920
Don't ever ask me! As long as
you live, don't ever ask me more!

450
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,320
[Sobs]

451
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,880
MARTIN: I'm awful sorry, Brad.

452
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,560
MARTIN: Wait a minute!

453
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,400
Get back here, Brad! Get back here!

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,080
MARTIN: Why don't you say it?

456
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,000
We're beaten, and you know it.

457
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,000
No.

458
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,320
Our turnin' back don't mean nothin'.

459
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,720
Not in the long run.

460
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,000
If she's alive, she's safe.
For a while, they'll...

461
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,440
...keep her and they'll raise
her as one of their own until...

462
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
...she's of an age to...

463
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,560
Do you think maybe there's a
chance we still might find her?

464
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,480
An Indian will chase a thing till
he thinks he's chased it enough.

465
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,160
Then he quits.

466
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,240
Same way when he runs.

467
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,040
Seems like he never learns
there's such a thing as...

468
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,040
...a critter who'll just keep coming on.

469
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,640
So we'll find 'em in
the end. I promise you.

470
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,720
We'll find 'em...

471
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,240
...just as sure as the
turnin' of the earth!

00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,960
You got my letter about your son, Brad?

477
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,600
Yeah.

478
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,040
Just about this time a year ago.

479
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,840
Oh, Ethan, this country...

480
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,000
Marty?

481
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,200
Martin Pawley!

482
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,880
Him? Probably forgotten all about
you, can't even call your name to mind!

483
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,120
Her name is Laurie.

484
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,200
But I fairly forgot
just how pretty she was.

485
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,960
Ethan.

486
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,800
What about Debbie?

487
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,240
Hey, what are you doin' anyway?

488
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,160
Don't go taking that stuff!

489
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,960
Well, it ain't worth the mending.

490
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,920
What are you gettin' so red in the
face about? I got brothers, ain't I?

491
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah, well, I ain't one of them.

492
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,600
Look here, Martin Pawley, I'm a woman.

493
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,720
We women wash and mend your
dirty clothes all your lives.

494
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,640
When you're little, we even wash you!

495
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,800
How you can ever make out to be bashful
in front of a woman, I'll never know.

496
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,600
You talk like a fella just
might as well run around naked.

LAURIE: It wouldn't bother me none.

498
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,760

501
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,280
ETHAN: We kept trackin' 'em till
the blizzards hit. Then we lost their trail.

502
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,600
Don't need to tell you where we went:
Fort Richardson, Wingate, Cobb...

503
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,600
Trouble is, we don't know which
band the war party belonged to.

504
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,840
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.

505
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,440
I got your boy killed.

506
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,360
Don't go blamin' yourself for that.

507
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,280
It's this country that killed my boy.
Yes, by golly, I tell you Ethan...

508
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,640
Now, Lars, it just so
happens we'd be Texicans.

509
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,120
A Texican is nothing but a
human man way out on a limb.

510

This year and next...

511
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,040

don't think it will be forever.

00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,400
Maybe it needs our bones in the
ground before that time can come.

514
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,880

00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,680

516
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,480
LAURIE: Ma, Marty's drawers is a sight.

517
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,400
Would it be all right if we
give him some of Brad's things?

518
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,160
Of course. They're in Grandma's chest.

519
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,600
Ethan, you're going to
sleep in the bunkhouse.

520
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,240
The letter! In the chest! It
came for you, Ethan, last winter.

521
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,280
Charlie McCorry brought it.

522
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,920
LARS: I'm looking for that letter,
Charlie MacCorry...

523
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,400
Here it is. By golly, I forgot.

524
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,920
Excuse me.

526

527
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,080

528
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,320
Ever see it before? Maybe
on a dress Debbie wore?

529
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,480
Yes, it was an apron.

530
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,200
Have they found her yet?

531
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,840
Not yet.

532
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,800

You might at least have
left me my britches!

It's time for bed anyway.
Here, try these on.

I ain't gonna.

536
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,560
Well, likely they'll
need some takin' in.

537
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,280
Marty, you're that gaunt.

538
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,960
Ma's having turkey for dinner tomorrow.

539
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,480
Laurie, come. Let the boys get to bed.

540
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,960
LAURIE: All right, Pa.

541
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,240
- Good night, Marty.
- Good night, Laurie.

542
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,360
- 'Night, Mr. Edwards.
- 'Night, Ms. Jorgensen.

543
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,560
Jorgensen's been runnin'
my cattle with his own.

544
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,080
Your cattle?

545
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,520
You mean Debbie's cattle.

546
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,280
He's agreed to take you on and split
the increase in my herd while I'm gone.

547
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,680
I'm pushin' on tomorrow.

548
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,280
Well, I sure ain't gonna stay here!

549
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,640
I started out lookin' for
Debbie, I intend to keep on.

550
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,440
Why?

551
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,800
Why? Well, because she is my...

552
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,440
She's your nothing! She's
no kin to you at all!

553
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,000
I always kind of thought she was.

554
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,760
The way her folks took
me in and raised me...

555
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,480
That don't make you no kin.

556
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,640
All right, maybe it don't. But I
intend to keep on lookin' anyway.

557

How?

558
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,240
You got any horses, or money to buy 'em?

559
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,720
You ain't even got money for cartridges.

560
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,760
ETHAN: Jorgensen's offerin'
you a good livin' here.

561
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,600
Martin, I want you to know...

562
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,720
I know what you want me to know!

563
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,320
I've got no kin, no money, no horses!

564
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,840
All I got here is a bunch of
dead-man's clothes to wear!

565
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,120
You told me that already,
so, shut your mouth!

566
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,880
Mornin', Laurie.

567
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,120
Mornin', Marty. Did you sleep well?

568
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,200
MARTIN: Well, no.

569
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,200
I kind of tossed and...

570
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,480
...turned and dreamed.

571
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,160
I'll get your coffee.

572
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,280
You know, Laurie, I...

573
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,280
...I was thinking maybe it's time
you and me started goin' steady, huh?

574
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,800
You and me have been goin' steady
since we was three years old.

575
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,000
- We have?
- About time you found out about it!

576
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,920
Gosh, Laurie, I've always
been fond of you, but...

577
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,760
...with all this trouble
with Debbie and Ethan, I...

578
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,520
Ethan rode on an hour ago.

579
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,080
I don't know what you can do
about findin' Debbie that he can't.

580
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,760
He'll find her now,
Martin. Honest he will!

581
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,240
That's what I'm afraid of,
Laurie, him finding her!

582
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,240
I've seen his eyes at
the very word "Comanche".

583
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,520
I've seen him take his knife and...

584
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,840
Never mind. He's a man
that can go crazy wild!

585
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,880
And I intend to be there to
stop him, in case he does.

586
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,880
I was hopin' I could hold you
here, but I guess I knew better.

587
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,520
I stole that for you.

588

on the south fork of the Brazos.

- I've got to find him!

me here when you get back.

How'd you come by it?

614
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,000
- You said there was a $1,000 reward.
- That's what I said.

615
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,680
Got it with you?

You'll get the reward when I find
her, and if she's still alive.

A young buck fetched
it in late last summer.

624
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,400
Said it belonged to a
captive child of Chief Scar.

claimed he was a big war chief...

ETHAN: Keep talkin'.

Scar's band was headed north to winter
at Fort Wingate, eatin' agency beef.

said. Maybe he lied.

01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,480
"...bequeath...

1031
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,880

"...of any kind...

1033
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,760
"...to Martin Pawley".

1034
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,600
What do you mean, you
don't have any "blood kin"?

1035
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,760
Debbie is your blood kin!

1036
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,480
Not no more, she ain't!

1037
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,840
Well, you can keep your will!

1038
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,400
I don't want any of your property!

1039
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,960
Besides, I ain't forgettin' you was
gettin' all set to shoot her yourself.

1040
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,440
MARTIN: What kind of man are you anyway?

1041
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:07,760
- She's been livin' with a buck!
- Shut your dirty mouth!

1042
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:15,720
I hope you die!

1043
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,600

Good evening, everybody!

1050
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:24,040
Here he is! All curried, combed
and washed behind the ears.

1051
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,440
Charlie, you look right
handsome! I'd hardly know you.

1052
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,400
Yes, ma'am. I can't
hardly recognize myself.

1053
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,360
Get it on, Luther!

1054

NESBY: Why don't you have a drink?

1058
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,320
Oh, no, Nesby. Not till
I'm finished my clergyin'.

1059
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,720
- Bar's closed. Right, Sister Jorgensen?
- Right!

1060
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,440
SAM: All right, let's go!
Let's get it goin'!

1061
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:10,840
Go ahead.

1062

1066
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:37,720

[Singing continues]

1072
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,440
Hey, you don't suppose they're
throwin' a party for us, do you?

1073
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,160
That'll be the day!

1074
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,200
I'm all right.

1075
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,640
Ethan, Martin! You can't come
in! The rangers are in there.

1076
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,280
What's that got to do with us?

1077
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,640
You're both posted for
murder. The both of you!

1078
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,040
That trader, the late Futterman...

1079
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,040
The Reverend and the
rangers are in there now...

1080
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:48,040
Well, what's goin' on anyway?

1081
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,920
Looks like you two will
have a lot to talk about.

1082
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,360
ETHAN: Come on, Lars.
LARS: Ethan... hide in the barn!

1083
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,760
ETHAN: What for?

1084
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,560
LAURIE: Martin...

Evenin'.

1089
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,200
Is the bar open?

1090
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:25,680
MRS. JORGENSEN:
Any news of our little girl?

1091
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:28,040
She's not a little girl anymore.

1092
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,080
You've seen her? She's alive?

1093
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,400
I've seen her and she's alive.

1094
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,400
Good evening, Reverend. Or
should I call you "Captain"?

1095
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,240
I came here for a wedding, Ethan.

1096
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:44,080
Till that's over, "Reverend"
will do. Afterwards we'll talk.

1097
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:46,080
- Is Marty with you?
- Yep.

1098
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:51,720
LARS: Charlie, please!
MRS. JORGENSEN: Charlie!

1099
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:54,720
It's good to see you back,
Ethan. We'll join you.

1100
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,880
But I wrote you one letter.

1101
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,480
One letter in five years!

1102
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:05,080
I read it till the paper dried
up and the writin' faded out.

1103
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,680
It wasn't much of a letter, was it?

1104
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,960
No, it wasn't.

1105
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,720
Might've at least said you loved me.

1106
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:19,280
You might've asked me to wait for you.
At least that'd have been somethin'.

1107
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,880
But I always loved you!

1108
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,960
I thought you knew that
without me havin' to say it.

1109
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,080
It isn't fair, Martin Pawley!

1110
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,880
It isn't fair and you know it!

1111
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,680
- I wish you wouldn't cry, Laurie.
- Who's cryin'?

1112
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,800
MARTIN: I reckon the best thing
for me to do is to go away.

1113
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:52,560
You do, Martin Pawley,
and I'll just die!

1114
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:07,240
I'll thank you to unhand my fiancée.

1115
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,440
You don't mean you're
gonna be marryin' him?

1116
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:16,760
Charlie MacCorry?

1117
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:18,240
She sure is!

1118
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,200
And don't think your comin'
back is gonna change it either!

1119
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,200
Well, now, as to that, I
just don't know, Charlie.

1120
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,440
We hadn't gotten around
to talkin' about marriage.

1121
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,800
What right have you to talk
marriage to any decent woman?

1122
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,280
If you're referrin' to
that crazy murder charge...

1123
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,720
And other things.

1124
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:40,400
You think you're gettin' away with bein'
smart about the Indian wife you took.

1125
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,080
[Charlie laughs]

1126
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,840
I'll bet she ain't the
first squaw you ever...

1127
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,600
Why, you are a no good...

1128
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,480
[Crash]

1129
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,000
Oh, Marty, you've done it again!

1130
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:56,600
Get out of my way!

1131
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:59,640
Marty! Charlie! I ain't gonna
have no fightin' in my house.

1132
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,680
Well, then we're just gonna
fight outside, doggone it!

1133
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:04,360
I ain't totin' no firearms.

1134
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,880
Well, that sure ain't
gonna be no problem.

1135
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,240
- After you, Marty.
- After you, Charlie.

1136
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,440
LAURIE: Ma! Reverend! Pa!

1137
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,480
MARTIN: Look, here.

1138
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,040
CHARLIE: Thank you.

1139
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,080
Spit over that piece of firewood.

1140
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,000
[Crash]

1141
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,000
[High-pitched groan]

1142
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,680
CHARLIE: Quit that, Marty!
That ain't fair!

1143
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,960
Martin! Martin! Charlie!

1144
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,240
LAURIE: Marty, now you stop that!

1145
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,120
SAM: Marty! Charlie!

1146
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,440
Sergeant MacCorry!

1147
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,440
Is this here altercation
in the line of duty?

1148
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:19,840
CHARLIE: No, sir. It's more in
the nature of a private fight.

1149
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,920
All right, then, go ahead. But
fight fair. No biting or gouging!

1150
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,520
SAM: And no kicking either!

1151
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,320
SAM: Get them up!
Make them fight fair!

1152
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:31,880
SAM: Now you fight fair, Martin!

1153
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:33,600
CHARLIE: Wait a minute!

1154
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,480
Somebody's fiddle.

1155
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,480
MARTIN: Hey, Seth!

1156
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,160
SAM: No choking! No gouging!

1157
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,080
Mr. Edwards, make 'em stop!

1158
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,680
Why? You started it.

1159
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,200
Marty, watch his feet!

1160
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,080
Oh, Ethan! No!

1161
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,600
ETHAN: Don't forget, you're a lady.

1162
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,880
SAM: Come on now, fight fair!

1163
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:00,400
[Men groaning]

1164
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,360
SAM: Come on, Charlie!
That's it, Charlie!

1165
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,480
[Men cheering]

1166
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,560
[Thud]

1167
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,560
SAM: Come on, Charlie. Get up!

1168
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,320
Are you all right?

1169
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,120
CHARLIE: I reckon so.

1170
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:20,880
Now, come on. I want you boys
to shake hands and make friends.

1171
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:24,280
Sorry I bit your ear, Marty.

1172
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,120
It don't hurt none, Charlie.

1173
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:32,000
Now you boys get cleaned up and
we'll proceed with the wedding.

1174
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:35,720
SAM: Where's my Bible?
CHARLIE: There ain't gonna be no wedding.

1175
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:46,440
Not till we get a few things
cleared up around here.

1176
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,400
SAM: It was a nice wedding party,
considering nobody got married.

1177
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,080
[Smack]

1178
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:02,360
SAM: Ethan, I gotta ask you and Martin
to take a ride with me...

1179
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:04,320
...down to the state capital.

1180
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:08,040
ETHAN: Is this an invite to
a necktie party, Reverend?

1181
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,280
No, I wouldn't say that.

1182
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,840
Likely you had your reasons
for killin' Futterman.

1183
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:16,360
Probably needed killin'.

1184
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,320
I'm talking to you now as
a ranger, not as a preacher.

1185
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,280
The fact that all three of
'em was shot in the back was...

1186
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,880
...the only thing that
raised some questions.

1187
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:28,840
That, and...

1188
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:32,800
...a missin' gold piece that
was known to have been on him...

1189
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,680
...just prior to his demise.

1190
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,160
Ethan, I'll have to
ask you for your gun.

1191
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,800
MARTIN: Well, if it's all
the same to you, Reverend...

1192
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,440
...I ain't goin' to Austin!

1193
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,120
CHARLIE: You're goin'
if the captain says so.

1194
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,520
SAM: Stop it! Stop it!

1195
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,960
SAM: I'll put both of you boys
in the smokehouse to cool off.

1196
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:09,760
Good evening, ma'am. Captain Clayton?

1197
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:12,600
Excuse me, ma'am.

1198
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,840
- Captain Clayton, sir?
- No.

1199
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,240
SAM: I'm Captain Clayton.

1200
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:22,160
- You're Captain Clayton?
- Yes, I'm Captain Clayton.

1201
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,760
Col. Greenhill's compliments,
sir. The colonel wants to know...

1202
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,840
- Is your head cold?
- No, sir.

1203
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,440
I'm sorry, sir.

1204
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:33,920
- All right, start at the beginning.
- Col. Greenhill's compliments, sir.

1205
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,720
Hold on, son. Who is this Col.
Greenhill you're talking about?

1206
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,680
Why, Col. Greenhill
is Col. Greenhill, sir.

1207
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,560
- Commanding officer of the 15th...
- And who are you?

1208
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:42,280
I'm Lt. Greenhill, sir.

1209
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:44,440
What is it your pa wants to know?

1210
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:46,480
Well, go ahead.

1211
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,760
My pa wants to know... Col.
Greenhill wants to know...

1212
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:50,200
...how soon you can put a company...

1213
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:52,000
ETHAN: Turn around, sonny.

1214
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,720
ETHAN: Yeah, he's a Yankee cavalryman.

1215
01:39:56,440 --> 01:40:00,280
Col. Greenhill wants to know how
soon you could... I resent that, sir!

1216
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,760
ETHAN: Just funnin', son, just funnin'.

1217
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,560
How soon you could put a company
of your men in the field...

1218
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:07,640
...fully armed for joint-punitive
action against the Comanches?

1219
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,960
- Joint what?
- Joint-punitive action.

1220
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:14,160
We received information about a band
of Comanches under a chief named Scar.

1221
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:15,600
What information?

1222
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,760
That maybe he's not far from
here, holed up somewhere.

1223
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,600
What makes you think
he's not far from here?

1224
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,440
One of our patrollers picked up a man...

1225
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,760
...claims he was a prisoner
with Scar till two days ago.

1226
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:26,040
Talks kind of crazy,
but we brought him along.

1227
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:28,520
Says he lives here. Keeps
mentioning a rocking chair.

1228
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,000
Mose. Mose!

1229
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,400
ETHAN: Take his arms.

1230
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,040
MRS. JORGENSEN: It's Mose!

1231
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:44,200
Good evening, ma'am. I
came for my rocking chair.

1232
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:46,880
MRS. JORGENSEN: Bring him to the fire.
ETHAN: Watch him!

1233

1234
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,160

1235
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,840
ETHAN: Here, get him a chair.

1236
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,760
LARS: Charlie, bring him a drink!

1237
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,080
ETHAN: Watch his head!

1238
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:02,760
LARS: Take a drink, Mose.
MARTIN: Drink that down, Mose.

1239
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:08,280
ETHAN: Mose. Scar... where is he?

1240
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,160
My rocking chair. You
promised me my rocking chair.

1241
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:13,640
ETHAN: Where is Scar?

1242
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:16,440
Ask him about Debbie. Is
Debbie all right, Mose?

1243
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,360
[Chuckles] Made out I was crazy.

1244
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:26,040
MOSE: You don't think
I'm crazy, do you, ma'am?

1245
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,280
No, Mose, you're just sick and hurt.

1246
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:29,680
MOSE: Thank you, ma'am.

1247
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,680
Mose, try and remember.
You were at Scar's camp.

1248
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:36,120
I ate dirt and chewed
grass. I fooled them.

1249
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:38,160
ETHAN: Where is Scar holed up?

1250
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,720
I won't tell you.

1251
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:43,240
I'll tell Marty.

1252
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:45,880
Seven Fingers, Marty. Seven fingers.

1253
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,680
MRS. JORGENSEN: That's enough, Ethan.
Let's get him to bed.

1254
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,560
ETHAN: Seven Fingers?
LIEUTENANT: Beg to report, sir...

1255
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:56,160
...that's what he told us, but
there's no such place on the maps.

1256
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:02,120
Isn't it the Caddo name for where all
them canyons join under the Malapai?

1257
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:04,520
SAM: Seven Fingers of Brazos!

1258
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:07,320
LARS: Come on, Mama.
Let's get him to his room.

1259
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:08,480
My rocking chair?

1260
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,520
MRS. JORGENSEN: We'll bring it.

1261
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:14,040
You go tell your pa that
a company of rangers...

1262
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:16,240
...all 14 of 'em, fully
armed and equipped...

1263
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,000
...will be in the field by daylight.

1264
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,400
We'll be headin' for the
south end of the Malapai.

1265
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,080
If he can catch up with
us, all well and good!

1266
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:26,920
We can't take the field
tomorrow. For your own protection.

1267
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:30,960
Sonny. Out yonder is
a pack of murderers...

1268
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:34,280
...complete with Texican
scalps and a white-girl captive!

1269
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:37,200
If you want to protect us,
just keep out of our way.

1270
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,080
Now you skedaddle back to your pa!

1271
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,160
Ethan...

1272
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:44,040
SAM: You and Martin are hereby
appointed civilian scouts. Without pay.

1273
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:47,720
Take the boys and get back to
headquarters and pick up my company.

1274
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:51,680
Martin?

1275
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,560
You're not going! Not this time.

1276
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:01,920
Are you crazy?

1277
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:05,000
It's too late. She is a woman grown now.

1278
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:08,160
I gotta go, Laurie. I
gotta fetch her home.

1279
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:09,600
Fetch what?

1280
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:13,600
The leavings of Comanche bucks sold time
and again to the highest bidder with...

1281
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:15,000
Laurie, shut your mouth!

1282
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:17,560
Do you know what Ethan
will do if he has a chance?

1283
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:19,640
He'll put a bullet in her brain!

1284
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:22,520
I tell you, Martha would want him to!

1285

We can get within 200 yards of them.

1290
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,400
There's a hub back off to the left.

1291
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:18,960
How many, you figure?

1292
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,440
About a dozen each.

1293
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:23,520
Enough to go around.

1294
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:33,760
SAM: Well, we found 'em!

1295
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:36,680
Now, men...

1296
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,840
...the state of Texas is paying
you 12 Yankee dollars a month.

1297
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,320
Now is your chance to earn it!

1298
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,880
Tighten up your cinches. We'll
go chargin' in about sunup.

1299
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:51,720
SAM: Now make sure that...
MARTIN: Just a minute, Reverend!

1300
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:59,600
If we go charging in, they'll
kill her! And you know it.

1301
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:02,560
ETHAN: That's what I'm countin' on.
MARTIN: I know you are.

1302
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:05,400
Well, it ain't gonna be that way!
She's alive and she's gonna stay alive!

1303
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:07,080
Living with Comanches ain't bein' alive.

1304
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:10,240
It's better she's alive and livin' with
Comanches than her brains bashed out!

1305
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:13,080
Now, son, I know this is
a bitter thing to say...

1306
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:15,560
...but there's more at
stake here than your sister.

1307
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:18,280
There sure is. I'm
gonna tell you somethin'.

1308
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,160
I didn't mean to speak of it,
but I'm gonna tell you now.

1309
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:26,040
You remember that scalp strung
on Scar's lance? Long and wavy?

1310
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:29,600
Yeah, I saw it. And don't try to tell
me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's!

1311
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:31,240
It was your mother's.

1312

MARTIN: That don't change it.
That don't change nothing!

1313
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:45,400

her out, before you come chargin' in.

1315
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,960
- That don't tell them nothin', does it?
- I said no!

1316
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:55,280
You go right ahead, son. But at the
first sign of an alarm, we're comin' in.

1317
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:00,640
We ain't gonna have no time to pick
and choose our targets when we do!

Yes, sir. The troops are 10 miles back.

God forbid.

pa where we are and where he is.
