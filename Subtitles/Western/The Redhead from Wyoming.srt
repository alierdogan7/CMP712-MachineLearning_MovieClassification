<i>[Narrator] When the territories of
the Great West were thrown open...</i>

2
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,683
<i>men of all kinds rushed in.</i>

3
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:18,903
<i>Most came to settle peaceably,
lured by free land...</i>

4
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,425
<i>gold, cattle.</i>

5
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:25,121
<i>A man could begin a herd
with a maverick:</i>

6
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:27,948
<i>An unbranded stray
on the public range.</i>

7
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:31,296
<i>By putting his brand on it,
he owned it.</i>

8
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,992
<i>Cattle barons had started
their great herds with mavericks.</i>

9
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,211
<i>Now they fought each settler
who tried to do the same.</i>

10
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:42,385
<i>They fought to keep the settlers
off the public lands...</i>

11
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:46,168
<i>drive them from their homes...</i>

12
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,430
<i>destroy their towns.</i>

13
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:56,866
<i>Vast ranges became the
battlegrounds of cattle wars.</i>

14
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,693
<i>When the Wyoming big ranchers
found guns were not enough...</i>

15
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:06,781
<i>they used the Maverick Law:</i>

16
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:09,955
<i>A law through which they appointed
themselves commissioners...</i>

17
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:13,696
<i>with power to rule on the ownership
of every maverick branded.</i>

18
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:17,261
<i>A commissioner's ruling could
declare the settler a rustler...</i>

19
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:21,393
<i>outlaw his brand,
make his mavericks illegal to sell.</i>

20
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,132
<i>Of course, there was no shortage
of sharp-witted men...</i>

21
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,438
<i>who were quick
to take advantage of this law.</i>

22
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:28,612
I know what I'm entitled to!

23
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:31,003
I'm willing to fight for my rights!

24
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:35,483
And I'm willing to fight for your rights,
but you've got to stand behind me.

25
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,396
You've got to put me
in the Governor's mansion!

26
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:42,615
You've got to have someone to
represent you, not just Reece Duncan.

27
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:45,094
Go ahead, Mr Averell.
Don't let me stop you.

28
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,051

Your ears burning?

30
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:52,877
<i>[Averell]
What is this Maverick Law?</i>

31
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:57,835
The Maverick Law was designed to
protect us all against cattle rustling.

32
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:01,183
There is nothing in that law
that says new settlers...

33
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,922
can't pick up unbranded cattle
and call them their own.

34
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:09,184
<i>When a Cattle Commission was appointed
to watch over brands and cattle...</i>

35
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,358
<i>that was for our protection too!</i>

36
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:14,142
I'd like to ask Mr Duncan
one question.

37
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:16,839
<i>I'd like to ask him
who paid bribe money...</i>

38
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:20,405
<i>to the Cattle Commissioners
to outlaw your brands?</i>

39
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:25,014
<i>To see to it that every time you roped
a maverick it was confiscated?</i>

40
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:33,450
Just hold it still everybody,
real quiet and still.

41
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:35,669
Put the gun away.

42
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:39,800
I only aimed to drill his hat, Sheriff.
Just let out some hot air.

43
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:48,192
Keep it there.

44
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,976
I think Mr Duncan would like
a crack at the governorship himself.

45
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:54,846
Do you reckon Wyoming
will ever have a Governor...

46
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:57,628
who'll take a shot at a man
who doesn't wear a gun?

47
00:03:57,716 --> 00:04:02,283
No... or anyone who carries it
under cover either.

48
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:11,631
- This is a big deal, Sheriff.
You ought to step out of it.
- Everybody oughta.

49
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:15,936
I'm warning you men, this range is taken.
There's no room for squatters.

50
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:19,502
- You started from scratch yourself,
Duncan.
- "That was a long time past."

51
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,981
For you!
But we're just beginnin'!

52
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:24,633
And we aim to start with mavericks,
and we aim to stay.

53
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:27,939
You'll stay just so long
as you stay within the law.

54
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:32,289
Which means that if I find
any one of you rounding up
and branding cattle on my range...

55
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:34,463

to fill you full of lead.

Sorry, Jim, there's no money in it,
just a poor, underpaid judge.

I guess somebody oughta give me

00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,782
Maybe somebody will.

But you came when I called you.
You didn't waste any time.

Birds of a feather.

130

You will, honey. You will.

Believe me, that last sour deal

133
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:51,916
I'm going up... up and up right into
the Governor's mansion.

00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:54,744
- To ask a pardon?
- To be the Governor!

135
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,440
I'm going to make the whole territory
of Wyoming my own private range.

136
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:03,266
Think I can't do it? These settlers
would vote me into the White House.

137
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,484
I'm the only one around here
who'll promise them anything.

138

- And what's in your way?
- Reece Duncan.

139
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:13,225
I got a big front, but he is big.

140
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:19,009
Sounds crazy, but it's true. If Duncan goes,
I can be Governor of Wyoming.

141
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:22,444
You will, of course,
drop in sometime for a drink.

And you'll be with me.
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Kate.

I'm going to make up to you
for everything.

144
00:10:31,402 --> 00:10:33,489
What's this other thing about?

145
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,751
Why am I a cattle buyer?

146
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:41,665
You don't have to know anything
about cattle. Don't let that scare you.

147
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:45,796
I know plenty.
I was riding a cow pony before I could walk.

148
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:49,492
- What's the deal?
- Duncan again, but you don't
have to know the details.

That's a rustler!
- Matt Jessup?

170
00:13:20,348 --> 00:13:24,132
- I'm missing branded steers.
- The Jessup boys are taking mavericks.

171
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:26,959
These weren't mavericks.
They carried the Bar-Double-Check.

172
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:31,785
I don't say you didn't lose 'em.
There've been reports of strange faces.

173
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:35,874
Sheriff, there's gonna be
a range war here.

174
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,656
I suggest you make up
"your mind whose side you're on.

175
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:42,395
I have. I'm on the side
of the first man who gets killed.

176
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:49,832
- I could knock him off right now.
Why wait?
- Naw.

177
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,050
Save us weeks of work
and put that loud-talking Duncan
where Averell wants him.

178
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:57,051
- I said no!
- Why not?

179
00:13:57,137 --> 00:14:00,225
'Cause Averell said
to let him burn a while.

180
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:04,183
I told him to come after midnight.

181
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,400
After midnight? He better.

182
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:09,532
He does what you say. This afternoon
he could've finished Duncan off easy...

183
00:14:09,618 --> 00:14:12,227
but he let him go because
that's what you wanted.

184
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:14,707
I don't get it, boss.

185
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:16,968
Abilene taught me something.

186
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:20,752
To wait.

187
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,056
We set one side against the other.

188
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:26,188
Prod 'em a little;
first Duncan, then the settlers.

189
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:28,319
And wait till they
kill each other off.

190
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:30,623
That's the way to get
things done for you.

191
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:33,406
In fact, that's the way
into the Governor's chair.

192
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:36,060
How will that help you
to become Governor?

193
00:14:36,146 --> 00:14:40,798
Look, when times are rough, a man can
make himself a reputation overnight...

194
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:43,713
that'll spread through
the whole territory like wildfire.

195
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,974
That's if he's on the popular side.

196
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:49,104
And right now I've got these settlers
eating out of my hand.

197
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:53,063
The way you got it figured,
there won't be any settlers left.

198
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:55,715
Now, that'd be too bad.

199
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:58,890
In that case, I'd have to take
the consolation prize...

200
00:14:58,976 --> 00:15:02,411
and all the cattle and
all the land in this valley.

201
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:07,760
I might become one of the richest,
most important men
in the territory of Wyoming.

202
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:10,066
There's more than one way
to become Governor.

203
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:14,588
- Does Kate know how you're
running the cattle set-up?
- No!

204
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:19,721
And nobody'll know if you and the boys
keep your mouths shut and do as I tell ya.

205
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,851
Understand?

00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:24,068

- Go ahead.

211

With Jim, I can at least
keep my eyes on the cards.

212
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:25,125
Good evening, Sheriff.
Drifting?

213
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:28,081
Mmm!
Got a nice, clean shave there.

214
00:16:28,168 --> 00:16:31,168
I bet it was for me.

215
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:35,561
You're keeping the boys busy,
roping by day and gambling at night.

216
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:37,996
This is a free country.
They work hard for their money...

217
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,301
and they got a right to spend it
the way they want to.

218
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:42,432
None of my business.

219
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,998
Just wonderin' where some of'em
find time to do any rustling.

220
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:49,433
Duncan's on the warpath.
Somebody's taking his branded stock.

221
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,695
Oh, he's just talkin'.
He's got to say that to stir up trouble.

222
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:56,826
No, there's rustling going on.
Got it from the other ranchers.

223
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:02,174
The cows I buy are clean,
unbranded mavericks.

224
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:06,524
- You ever see a range war?
- There isn't going to be a range war here.

225
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,480
- A few rustled cattle-
- A few rustled cattle started
the bloodiest killings in Texas.

226
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:16,916
- I was there.
- Oh, so that's where you hail from, Texas.

227
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:18,612
Mm-hmm.

228
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:22,396
- What brought you here?
- Passin' through.

229
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:26,918
- Oh, drifting.
- You don't like that.

230
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:32,746
A man knows where he's going.

231
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,138
Take a look at Jim Averell.

232
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:40,792
- There's a real man!
- I heard him say so.

233
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:44,227
Kate, you've got a couple more mavericks
in your corral than you had.

234
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,792
- Thanks, Hal.
- Let's have a look.

235
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:49,228
Is anything wrong with it?

236
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:51,923
No.

237
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:56,576
- Don't you ever forget
that badge you're wearing?
- No.

238
00:17:56,663 --> 00:17:58,751
Feelin' lucky, Hal?

239
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:01,664
No, I'd like it in cash.
I'm saving.

240
00:18:01,752 --> 00:18:03,883
For any particular reason?

241
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:08,100
- How'd you know?
- He means it, Kate.

242
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:10,884
Aw, honey, they all mean it!

243
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,363
Here. One free drink
on the house and then get out.

244
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,450
I need the space
for the free spenders.

245
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:21,928
Since you're on duty tonight, Sheriff,
how 'bout coming out back...

246
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:24,104
and letting me show you my stuff?

247
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,191
It's a nice moon out tonight.
Bright enough to read a brand.

248
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:33,628
Well, there they are.
Any of them look stolen?

249
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,802
Nice lookin' stock.

250
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:38,847
- And mavericks every one.
- Lots of'em too.

251
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:42,891
- Is that suspicious,
doing business on a big scale?
- No.

252
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:45,716
Every one of those cows
were taken off the free range.

253
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:47,935
You don't have to spit fire at me.

254
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:50,718
My word's good enough for everybody
else, it ought to be good enough for you.

255
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:54,806
- It is.
- Then don't come with rumours
of rustling and range wars.

256
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:59,719
I'm a businesswoman
giving the homesteaders
their first look at cash in two years.

257
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:04,502
- I don't want trouble!
- There's trouble in the range.
You'll be in it along with us.

258
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,416
Not if I'm playing straight
and minding my own business.

259
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:11,722
My pa minded his own business.

260
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,679
We had a small spread
down near Houston.

261
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,940
When the trouble came,
he said he'd stay out of it.

262
00:19:17,027 --> 00:19:19,028
The range war
"you were talking about?

263
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:21,723
I was up in the barn
when the shootin' started.

264
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:25,724
By the time I got down and ran for my rifle,
Pa was hanging on the corral fence.

265
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:30,160
Ma was dead,
lying in the front yard.

266
00:19:30,247 --> 00:19:33,508
- They killed my three brothers.
- Who killed them?

267
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:36,247
Folks, neighbours...

268
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:39,032
people who just got so mad
they started killin'.

269
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:42,511
- How old were you then?
- Thirteen.

270
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,686
Thirteen?
Your whole family?

271
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:47,860
Is that when you started drifting?

272
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:51,165
Drifting's not so bad.
A man sees a lot of country.

273
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:53,382
Not anything he can call his own.

274
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:56,079
Why own something
if you don't need it?

275
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,687
What about marriage?

276
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:02,384
Have you ever thought
about getting married?

277
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:04,906
Some. You?

278
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:08,429
<i>Kate, need you inside.</i>

279
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,734
We'll talk some more later, huh?

280
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:24,909
[Mooing, Bellowing]

281
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,564
Someone's coming. Put that away.
We'll take care of him.

282
00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:06,527
It's the sheriff.
Go get Averell.

283
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:09,354
You were told not to show up
before midnight.

284
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:11,528
In this business, you show up when
"you've got the goods.

285
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:16,225
- How much did he see?
- There's no tellin'.

286
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:18,747
- Get rid of him.
- For good?

287
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:20,921
<i>[Kate]
Leave him alone.</i>

288
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:24,965
Ever since that Abilene business...

289
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:28,661
every time you get called out of a room,
I get an urge to follow you.

290
00:21:28,748 --> 00:21:31,618
- Now, what's this about?
- Nothing, honey.

291
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:35,229
This drifter was interfering
in something private.

292
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:39,881
As a drifter or as the sheriff?
And what jail did you boys break out of?

293
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,403
Do we take him or not?

294
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:45,491
You leave him alone,
that's what you'll do!

295
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:50,493
And I hope you're thinking up a good story,
Jim, because I'm getting awfully mad.

296
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,450
Don't.
You'll only come apologizing later.

297
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,754
He's nobody to be skittish about.

298
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:58,755
Dump him where he'll have
a long walk back.

299
00:21:58,842 --> 00:22:01,016
How do I know
they won't kill him?

300
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:03,669
I wouldn't trust them
as far as I could throw a steer.

301
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:08,148
They do exactly as I tell them.
Get to it, men.

302
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:12,322
You like him?

303
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:16,063
No! There's no money
in that kind of maverick.

304
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,716
All right.
Who are those men?

305
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:24,542
It seems they were running
some cattle into your corral.

306
00:22:24,629 --> 00:22:26,803
- Whose cattle?
- Yours.

307
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:29,282
Anyway, your brand.

308
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,804
There weren't that many here
a few minutes ago!

309
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:37,414
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Kate.

310
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:39,241
Look at this.

311
00:22:40,284 --> 00:22:43,415
Here's Reece Duncan's brand.

312
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,590
Bar-Double-Check.

313
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:50,373
Now watch.
This is clever.

314
00:22:58,201 --> 00:23:01,071
K-Bar-M.

315
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:07,855
Katie, somebody's apt
to call you a cattle rustler.

316
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:12,552
- Why you dirty, low-down-
- It takes money to run for office.

317
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:16,204
You'll never be Governor.
You'll be crow bait on the end of a rope.

318
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:19,336
I'm no rustler... but you are.

319
00:23:19,422 --> 00:23:22,597
This is your brand,
registered in your name.

320
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:25,163
I don't share the business with you.
I gave it to you.

321
00:23:25,249 --> 00:23:29,686
You're the one who's been
buying and selling cattle.
How do you get out of that?

322
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:32,381
Wait till I tell Stan about this...
and Duncan!

323
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:36,643
What if they don't believe you?
Pretty big risk, isn't it?

324
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,818
Jim, what are you up to?

325
00:23:39,905 --> 00:23:42,340
This isn't a big enough
operation for you.

326
00:23:42,427 --> 00:23:45,124
I've told you, we're going to
the Governor's mansion.

327
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:48,428
It's going to take time
and a lot of money.

328
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:52,472
And meanwhile,
"you'll keep your pretty mouth shut.

329
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,082
When I'm playing for high stakes,
I get awfully upset if anyone talks.

330
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:24,783
Hi, Sheriff!

331
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:27,784
Maybe you can teach
Knuckles how to ride. I give up.

332
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:30,741
Come on, you stumblebum.

333
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:32,742
- Where's Kate?
- Went riding.

334
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:36,698
Come on, Knuckles! You're not going
to throw in the towel, are you?

335
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:40,091
<i>[Knuckles]
I'll get a decision over you yet!</i>

336
00:24:48,744 --> 00:24:51,615
<i>[Woman]
Hold on tight, Knuckles!</i>

337
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,659
[Knuckles]
Come on, ya bum.

338
00:24:58,745 --> 00:25:01,399
Hi, everybody.

339
00:25:05,096 --> 00:25:08,096
You look like you
came off second best.

340
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:11,011
- Third!
- Bet you brought him in,
though, whoever he was.

341
00:25:11,097 --> 00:25:13,315
- No, he's still kinda loose.
- But you will!

342
00:25:13,402 --> 00:25:18,142
- I aim to.
You had a lot of stock in here last night.
- Some.

343
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:21,012
- How many head
when we looked at them?
- Why?

344
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:23,534
How many head this morning
before you got them out in such a hurry?

345
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,839
Putting together that question
and that tin badge...

346
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:27,970
it looks like I'm accused
of being a rustler.

347
00:25:28,013 --> 00:25:32,319
Two minutes after you left last night,
some cattle came headin' for the corral.

348
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,536
Driven by my boys, of course!

349
00:25:34,623 --> 00:25:37,841
- Too dark to see that.
- But you did see them
put cattle into my corral!

350
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:42,015
- No, I got busy.
- So you've taken such
a personal dislike to me...

351
00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:44,234
that without seeing anything,
without any proof...

352
00:25:44,321 --> 00:25:47,582
- you're willing to believe that I'm a rustler!
- I haven't taken a dislike to ya.

353
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:49,843
Sheriff, I go by actions,
not by words...

354
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:52,104
and what I feel
when you talk to me-

355
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:57,105
- Why, I just feel as homely as a mud fence!
- Homely? You're the most-

356
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:04,410
Women!

357
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:18,111
- What did he say?
- I gave him a line. He won't be any trouble.

358
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:22,111
That's why he has that job.
That's why I gave it to him.

359
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:25,764
I took one look at him when he first
came into town and I said to myself...

360
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:28,591
"That's the kind of sheriff
I need: A drifter."

361
00:26:28,677 --> 00:26:32,505
I've got to hand it to you.
This time you're playing it smart, Jim.

362
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,114
It's nice to hear you say so...

363
00:26:35,157 --> 00:26:38,244
except I know you'd like
to see me break my neck.

364
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:41,289
That would be nice.

365
00:26:41,332 --> 00:26:45,637
Oh, Katie, you're just ungrateful.
Makes me very unhappy.

366
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:49,856
I don't like the way you operate.
You don't think of anyone but yourself.

367
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,073
What about the homesteaders
in this thing?

368
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,291
How long will it be before Duncan
starts taking it out on them?

369
00:26:55,378 --> 00:26:59,031
- What makes you think
he'd do a thing like that?
- You're hoping he will.

370
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,988
- Why, Kate!
- You want trouble. You want a range war.

371
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:07,032
You want so much killing that they'd
have to send troops in to keep the peace.

372
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,250
What an imagination!

373
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,077
Duncan killed, arrested,
or any way out of the running.

374
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:16,339
And the homesteaders just about wiped
out and ready to listen to anybody.

375
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,513
And who steps up to lead them?

376
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,905
- Jim Averell, the poor man's hope.
- It's a good phrase.

377
00:27:22,992 --> 00:27:26,601
I don't want any part of this.
I'm getting out of here.

378
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:29,559
You can't, Kate.

379
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:31,602
How far could you get?

380
00:27:31,689 --> 00:27:34,647
It won't take Duncan long
to trace his cattle to your corral...

381
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:37,126
and the sheriff to wire ahead.

382
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:41,300
They don't just arrest you
for cattle rustling.

383
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:43,822
Jim!

384
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:47,563
This act you're putting on about
not being interested in the sheriff.

385
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:51,693
- Now you're imagining things.
- I hope so.

386
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,216
I'm jealous, honey.
Can't get angry with me for that.

387
00:27:55,303 --> 00:27:59,738
Sure, I want to be up there where
I know I belong, but I want you with me.

388
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:02,130
I'm doing all of this for you, Katie.

389
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:04,652
I'll prove that to you yet.

390
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:07,914
But these things need time.

391
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,350
Yes, that's what we need... time.

392
00:28:27,397 --> 00:28:30,483
Get some of the boys
and fix that north line fence.

393
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:32,919
We gotta keep the herds closer in.

394
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:36,050
Jiminy!
Look what's coming.

395
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,747
<i>[Kate]
Good morning, Mr Duncan.</i>

396
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:47,183
What brings you out
in broad daylight?

397
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,835
I wouldn't mind sitting
in the shade for a while.

398
00:28:49,922 --> 00:28:54,445
- I'd like to be polite,
but I have a lot of work to do.
- My business won't take long.

399
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:13,361
Not much here to interest a woman.
It's a man's place.

400
00:29:13,449 --> 00:29:16,667
- Oh, that would interest a woman.
- Well, it hasn't.

401
00:29:16,753 --> 00:29:19,667
No wife? No womenfolk?

402
00:29:19,754 --> 00:29:23,539
- I'd have thought otherwise.
- I live alone.

403
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,843
Maybe that's why
"you're so successful.

404
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:30,757
- Everything goes into one big ambition.
- "So far."

405
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:33,757
Miss Maxwell, you said you had
something to talk to me about.

406
00:29:33,844 --> 00:29:35,888
I have: You.

407
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:38,715
I think you're making a big mistake.

408
00:29:38,802 --> 00:29:43,846
No, it's your settler friends who are making
the mistake with your encouragement.

409
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:47,717
Oh, now, Mr Duncan,
"you're a fair man.

410
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:51,631
Why don't you admit you started the
whole trouble by blacklisting their brands?

411
00:29:51,674 --> 00:29:55,066
If you came here thinking that by
being sweet to me and nice to look at...

412
00:29:55,152 --> 00:29:58,500
- I would become a more reasonable man-
- You are a reasonable man.

413
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,806
You've just never been
approached in the right way.

414
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,416
Miss Maxwell...

415
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:12,243
I came to this territory as a boy,
a ragged trail hand...

416
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,461
without a penny in my pocket
and my boots open at the toes.

417
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:20,026
In 10 years I owned or controlled
most of this valley. If you think
I'm going to sit back now-

418
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:23,419
Don't holler at me, Mr Duncan.

419
00:30:23,506 --> 00:30:27,768
If I made the mistake of thinking that
"you knew how to play for big stakes...

420
00:30:27,855 --> 00:30:29,725
I apologize.

421
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:32,725
<i>I was wrong.</i>

422
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:35,552
- What do you mean?
- I said I was wrong.

423
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,118
I thought you wanted to control
more than just this valley.

424
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:41,205
Why don't you read the cards,
Mr Duncan?

425
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:43,728
Before long, the settlers
will outnumber the cattlemen.

426
00:30:43,814 --> 00:30:46,293
It has to be that way.
There's nothing that can stop it.

427
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,859
Cooperate. Give them a chance
to earn an honest living...

428
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:52,643
and you'll be the most popular man
in the whole territory.

429
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:56,469
They'll put you in
the Governor's mansion...

430
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:59,209
not Jim Averell.

431
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:03,557
What happened, Miss Maxwell?
You have an argument with him?

432
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:10,863
Let's just say that I want
to be on the winning side.

433
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:13,124
Suppose this turns out
to be the winning side?

434
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:16,125
What's in it for you?

435
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:20,865
The winning side will be the one I tell
the settlers to throw their weight to.

436
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:25,344
And I think I'll let you
fix the reward.

437
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,040
You sound like
a natural-born politician.

438
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:30,388
It's all in knowing how to deal.

439
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,520
- "[Hoof Beats]"
- "[Man] Mr Duncan!"

440
00:31:33,607 --> 00:31:35,911
Mr Duncan!

441
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:38,608
We caught the Jessup brothers
running off with some of our stock.

442
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:42,695
We got 'em holed up the other side
of town in Pitchfork Canyon.

443
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,175
You expect me to throw in
with a bunch of outlaws?

444
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,833
I'll give you an example
of how a man gets rich.

445
00:32:23,921 --> 00:32:26,400
See that section there?

446
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:30,053
If I buy that up, I'll control six others
around it because of the water on it.

447
00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:32,400
- "[Gunshots]"
- It's all in knowing how.

448
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:35,400
- You hear shooting?
- Yeah. It's over near Duncan's place.

449
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:37,402
Let's go!

450
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:51,492
I'm out of shells, Matt.

451
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:56,145
Looks like we're gonna lose this one.

452
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:07,191
Blast 'em outta there!

453
00:33:09,582 --> 00:33:11,583
Hold your fire!

454
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:14,844
Better get down. You don't want
one of your own friends to shoot you.

455
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:17,626
Drop it.

456
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:19,714
I said drop it!

457
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:23,107
You'd better learn to take orders
once in a while, Mr Duncan.

458
00:33:23,193 --> 00:33:25,889
Now start moving!

459
00:33:25,977 --> 00:33:27,890
<i>[Gunshots]</i>

460
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:30,151
Stop firin', men.

461
00:33:32,413 --> 00:33:35,022
I keep underratin' you, Miss Maxwell.

462
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:37,717
I've got to stop that.

463
00:33:37,804 --> 00:33:39,805
Hal! Matt!

464
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:43,633
<i>[Kate]
Come out reaching!</i>

465
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,809
Looks interesting.

466
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:56,374
Keep me covered.

467
00:33:59,113 --> 00:34:01,505
- What's the story?
- They was rustling our cattle.

468
00:34:01,592 --> 00:34:05,201
- A lie! We found mavericks.
- They're not mavericks
when they're on my land.

469
00:34:05,246 --> 00:34:08,116
- We didn't set foot on your land.
- He was comin' from that way.

470
00:34:08,203 --> 00:34:10,507
Were those mavericks part of
Duncan's stock or weren't they?

471
00:34:10,594 --> 00:34:12,638
- "Where's your proof?"
- I don't need proof.

472
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:16,900
Them Jaspers were comin' from our herd,
and I know rustling when I see it.

473
00:34:16,986 --> 00:34:20,639
All you know is gunfighting. But if that's
what you want, you can have it now.

474
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:24,466
- But you'll have a dead boss.
- Simmer down, Wade.

475
00:34:24,553 --> 00:34:26,684
What do you want, Miss Maxwell?

476
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:28,902
Have you still got your horses?

477
00:34:28,988 --> 00:34:32,902
All right, get on 'em
and hightail it.

478
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,251
Don't move... anyone.

479
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:39,556
What's this all about?

480
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:42,730
Why, it's Mr Averell!
Glad to see you, Mr Averell.

481
00:34:42,818 --> 00:34:45,906
Miss Maxwell and I were talking
about you just a while ago.

482
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,950
That's nice.
What did you say?

483
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:52,255
Miss Maxwell did most of the talkin';
but I can see she didn't mean a word...

484
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:56,777
saying she might tell the settlers
to throw in with me against you.

485
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:05,605
You birds stick together
all the way.

486
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:12,954
I'll send this back to him.

487
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:15,954
You won't want to be
seeing him again.

488
00:35:18,521 --> 00:35:21,000
Evenin', boys. Myra?

489
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:24,130
We're short-handed.

490
00:35:24,218 --> 00:35:27,696
What am I?
A marriage bureau?

491
00:35:27,783 --> 00:35:30,305
Every time I get a dancer trained,
I lose her.

492
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:32,392
You're sure going to lose this one.

493
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:35,654
You know what you're doing, Myra?

494
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:39,393
I want to see a preacher in this, Hal,
or I'm gonna get after you with a.44.

495
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:42,220
We're gettin' married as soon as
I get more maverick money.

496
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:45,265
See that you hide it from him
when he celebrates.

497
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,048
<i>## [Honky-tonk Piano]</i>

498
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:56,658
- Been here long?
- Settin'.

499
00:35:56,746 --> 00:35:59,182
Can I "set" with you?

500
00:35:59,268 --> 00:36:01,312
Set.

501
00:36:03,486 --> 00:36:06,139
- What do you think?
- Nice team.

502
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:11,139
- Is there going to be trouble hereabouts?
- Mm-hmm.

503
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:13,575
- Killing?
- Can't tell.

504
00:36:13,661 --> 00:36:16,271
There's something queer going on.

505
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:19,706
Got another report of
strange faces in the hills.

506
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:24,403
Got another complaint from
Duncan about losing cows.

507
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:29,230
- What'd you see him about today?
- I was trying to make peace.

508
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:32,622
- How?
- I wanted him to look
at this whole thing sensibly.

509
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:35,101
He thinks he's being sensible right now.

510
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:39,536
- I thought maybe a woman's approach-
- A woman's approach?

511
00:36:39,624 --> 00:36:42,537
A gun in the back?

512
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,798
- So you know the whole story?
- I know you didn't do peace
any good today.

513
00:36:46,886 --> 00:36:51,060
What did you expect me to do? Let him
shoot down the Jessup boys or hang them?

514
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:55,147
Listen, Jim Averell brought you
out here and set you up in business.

515
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:59,193
- Everything you do is tied in with him.
Duncan hates Averell.
- No, you've-

516
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,455
When you held that gun in his back,
it was being held by Jim Averell...

517
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,759
who's lying to the settlers,
cattlemen, and...

518
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,150
- for all I know, lying to you.
- That's what I want to talk to you about.

519
00:37:08,238 --> 00:37:10,238
Those men are building for a fight...

520
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:13,804
and it won't take but one wrong move
to touch it off, set the range on fire!

521
00:37:13,892 --> 00:37:16,414
Will you listen to me?
I'm not Jim Averell's woman.

522
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:19,936
I choose my own man, whoever he is
or whatever he is, kingpin or drifter.

523
00:37:20,022 --> 00:37:22,110
- "[Gunshot]"
- "[Woman Screams]"

<i>[Hoof Beats]</i>

525
00:38:01,945 --> 00:38:06,032
It's a little early to tell anything yet.
He's a bit low.

526
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,424
- Any news?
- We lost him in the dark.

527
00:38:08,511 --> 00:38:11,208
- Spent the whole night combing the hills.
- It's a waste of time!

528
00:38:11,294 --> 00:38:13,685
I know where to go
for the bushwhacker.

529
00:38:13,772 --> 00:38:16,990
Duncan or one of his boys shot my brother.
Now it's my turn.

530
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:19,296
And then it's Duncan's turn,
and whose turn after that?

531
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:22,079
It's the way feuds get started,
and there's no telling where it will end.

532
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:26,253
I believe in law and order myself, Sheriff,
but there's also a thing called justice.

533
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,557
And I'm dealing some out.

534
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:32,168
The law didn't appoint you to do that,
Matt. Don't make me put you in jail.

535
00:38:32,254 --> 00:38:34,907
Stan, you're holding with Duncan.
The boys ain't gonna like it.

536
00:38:34,994 --> 00:38:39,039
You just sit down and cool off.
Don't try to jump a gun. It never works.

537
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:45,257
<i>Matt can always get another gun, and
Duncan always gives us another reason.</i>

538
00:38:45,344 --> 00:38:49,735
There's a war ahead, Sheriff.
You figure to stop it all by yourself?

539
00:38:49,822 --> 00:38:53,345
- Not if some folks want it.
- I say wipe out Duncan
and his whole outfit.

540
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:56,519
- It's the only thing that makes sense.
- "[Kate] You talk too much."

541
00:38:56,606 --> 00:39:00,911
It seems to me that all men
want to do is fight...

542
00:39:00,998 --> 00:39:05,304
even when they talk about peace...
like you!

543
00:39:05,392 --> 00:39:08,306
It's with a gun in their hands!

544
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:12,914
It's high time women took a hand
in running this world.

545
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:16,437
Duncan and his men run
the Cattle Association.

546
00:39:16,525 --> 00:39:19,873
The homesteaders are mad
because he keeps them out in the cold.

547
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,221
Very well.
Let's form an association of our own!

548
00:39:23,308 --> 00:39:27,308
Sure!
Our own outfit to do business for us!

549
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:33,180
That's for being the brainiest woman
I've ever met.

550
00:39:34,615 --> 00:39:38,267
Boys, Kate just had a great idea.

551
00:39:38,354 --> 00:39:42,659
It's the answer to everything. We'll form
our own stockmen's corporation.

552
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:47,095
We'll register our brands with it,
find buyers who'll deal with us.

553
00:39:47,181 --> 00:39:50,965
If the courts try to stop us, we'll have
an organization to fight back with.

554
00:39:51,052 --> 00:39:54,922
Jim, please. You're not a cattle raiser.
This has nothing to do with you.

555
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:58,532
Of course, this will all take money.
And it'll need leadership.

556
00:39:58,575 --> 00:40:00,576
I'm going to advance you the money.

557
00:40:00,663 --> 00:40:03,489
I want all you people
in this territory to know...

558
00:40:03,576 --> 00:40:07,054
that Jim Averell is with you...
all the way.

559
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:09,794
Get the boys together.

560
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:12,797
Better pick your side, Sheriff.

561
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,883
Smartest girl I ever knew.

562
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:24,016
You make good partners,
"you and Averell.

563
00:40:24,103 --> 00:40:26,189
What one thinks of
is good for the other.

564
00:40:26,277 --> 00:40:30,016
I didn't want him to be part of this.
He took it out of my hands.

565
00:40:30,103 --> 00:40:33,148
Played right into Duncan's.

566
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,238
[Man]
This is what we needed for a long time.

567
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:03,501
Kramer, you and Tiny Peterson
start bringing 'em in from the north range.

568
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:07,110
O'Conners, Stubbs,
handle the west range.

569
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:11,024
- Andrews, Elliot, Lamont-
- "[Women Laughing]"

570
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:25,941
Hey, Matt, you wouldn't want the men
to ride out in the sun...

571
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:28,289
without something to line their throats,
would you?

572
00:41:28,376 --> 00:41:32,116
- Where's Averell?
- I don't know. He left ahead of us.

573
00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:35,377
Kinda slow for a man
so anxious to help.

574
00:41:35,465 --> 00:41:38,160
<i>All right, men,
we got plenty of work ahead.</i>

575
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,988
- Got it?
- Couldn't you wait?

576
00:41:46,075 --> 00:41:48,988
Sure.

577
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:52,554
But not the boys.
They like to be paid as they go along.

578
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:59,207
It seems to me you go to an awful lot
of trouble just to start a shootin' war.

579
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:03,166
We could do the same thing by nightfall
by riding out and throwing a little lead.

580
00:42:03,252 --> 00:42:07,644
Mm-hmm. That's why it's a good idea
for you to do exactly as I say...

581
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:10,471
no more, no less.

582
00:42:20,213 --> 00:42:23,474
- Good coffee.
- Makes the best coffee
in the whole dang world.

583
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:26,040
Learned it from Kate.
There's someone who can cook.

584
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:29,693
Tell him some more.
I need all the recommendations I can get.

585
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:31,649
Here comes Averell with the tally book.

586
00:42:37,434 --> 00:42:39,998
Where have you been?
We've been waiting for the tally book.

587
00:42:40,086 --> 00:42:43,782
The horse threw his shoe.
We had to stop at the blacksmith's.

588
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,655
What's the matter, Sheriff?
Don't you believe me?

589
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,524
Just looking at the white stuff.

590
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:03,089
What about it?

591
00:43:03,177 --> 00:43:06,786
You come by way of Salt Lick Canyon.
Long way around, wasn't it?

592
00:43:06,873 --> 00:43:09,613
I said, what about it?

593
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,352
Nothing about it. Relax.

594
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:15,397
Here comes the first bunch!

595
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:24,616
- Duncan showed up yet?
- He'll be here.

596
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:27,095
Sandy, you just standin' around?

597
00:43:27,182 --> 00:43:31,009
- "I need an extra man to look for strays."
- I work for Jim Averell.

598
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:33,313
You'll work in this camp
or you don't eat.

599
00:43:33,357 --> 00:43:36,401
There's no grub to spare for gunslingers.

600
00:43:39,706 --> 00:43:40,837
I'll help you, Matt.

601
00:43:40,923 --> 00:43:43,185
I said a man to look for strays!

602
00:43:43,272 --> 00:43:45,663
Oh, I was cuttin' cattle
long before I cut cards!

603
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,794
Get me a horse, something alive!

604
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:49,838
Tom!

605
00:43:57,318 --> 00:43:58,274
Thank you.

606
00:43:58,362 --> 00:44:01,232
I wouldn't get on that critter, Kate.
It ain't safe!

[Whinnying]

608
00:44:15,974 --> 00:44:18,365
- Kate!
- [Whinnying]

609
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:31,586
Bet she'd be real handy
on a homestead.

00:45:07,723 --> 00:45:09,724
## [Harmonica]

611
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:34,468
- Round-up could be finished
before Duncan shows up.
- Not likely.

612
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:36,903
Trouble is, I hold with the settlers
instead of him.

613
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,730
- Makes it pretty hard being sheriff.
- It'll get harder all the time.

614
00:45:39,817 --> 00:45:43,861
- Duncan's not the kind who gives up.
- Maybe I am.

615
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,861
I didn't figure on this kind of thing
when I took this job.

616
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:49,340
I didn't figure on being Duncan's man...

617
00:45:49,428 --> 00:45:52,037
running around arresting homesteaders.

618
00:45:52,123 --> 00:45:57,341
Seems to me the best thing I can do
is turn in my badge and move on.

619
00:45:57,429 --> 00:46:00,038
- Where would you go?
- Yonder.

620
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,517
Yonder! Always yonder.

621
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,517
That's no life for a man.

622
00:46:06,604 --> 00:46:09,518
Haven't you ever thought about
sending down roots?

623
00:46:09,604 --> 00:46:13,345
- Staying in one place for a while?
- Reckon so...

624
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:17,823
when I find what I want.

625
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:20,607
What do you want?

626
00:46:26,608 --> 00:46:30,566
When Duncan hears how many
mavericks we rounded up...

627
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:36,784
he's gonna get a real bellyache.

628
00:46:49,178 --> 00:46:50,961
<i>Bar-VRanch, one calf.</i>

629
00:46:53,005 --> 00:46:55,441
Duncan's comin' up Loma Pass!

630
00:46:57,702 --> 00:47:00,702
Get your girls into that tent,
and get in with 'em. Stay under cover.

631
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:03,094
- But I want to be out here.
- Get into the tent!

632
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:06,442
<i>Off your horses, boys, and into place.
You know what to do.</i>

633
00:47:06,529 --> 00:47:08,312
Get every horse outta camp!

634
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,704
If there's any trouble,
they'll only be in the way.

635
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:14,052
Step lively, everybody!
He's on the other side of the hill.

636
00:47:23,315 --> 00:47:25,576
Wade, hold the men up here.

637
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:41,492
I don't know how far you thought
"you'd go with this fool idea, Averell...

638
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,841
but it comes to an end right now.

639
00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:46,016
Where's that sheriff?

640
00:47:49,016 --> 00:47:51,320
Here's a complaint
signed by Judge Crawford...

641
00:47:51,408 --> 00:47:54,495
to the effect that these men
are defying the Maverick Law.

642
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,670
<i>Serve it.</i>

643
00:48:00,888 --> 00:48:03,931
Seems all regular and in order.

644
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:08,150
Well, Sheriff, I just happen to have
a Federal injunction...

645
00:48:08,238 --> 00:48:11,411
enjoining these men from interfering
with this round-up...

646
00:48:11,498 --> 00:48:13,542
in any manner, shape or form.

647
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:16,369
Will you serve it, please?

648
00:48:21,457 --> 00:48:23,413
Looks like a stand-off.

649
00:48:25,632 --> 00:48:29,589
That Jim Averell!
Did anybody ever outsmart him?

650
00:48:29,676 --> 00:48:33,763
If Duncan doesn't win by brains,
he'll win another way.

651
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,503
Here it comes. Keep back.

652
00:48:38,068 --> 00:48:40,547
That's a pretty clever trick,
Mr Averell.

653
00:48:40,634 --> 00:48:43,331
<i>I'm surprised at myself
not figurin'on that.</i>

654
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:46,113
I've had it in my pocket
for a couple of days...

655
00:48:46,201 --> 00:48:48,114
<i>just waiting for you to show up.</i>

656
00:48:48,201 --> 00:48:52,159
Cancelling out my court order doesn't
cancel out my rights as a rancher.

657
00:48:52,247 --> 00:48:55,072
You don't know of any way
to stop me from stayin' here...

658
00:48:55,116 --> 00:48:59,509
<i>- "and keeping an eye peeled"
for my own stock?
- I wouldn't wanna stop ya.</i>

659
00:48:59,595 --> 00:49:03,901
Get a little nervous, though,
lookin' at all that artillery.

660
00:49:06,118 --> 00:49:08,379
That's why we brought it here.

661
00:49:08,466 --> 00:49:11,467
You won't need it here.

662
00:49:11,554 --> 00:49:14,467
Pick 'em up.

663
00:49:14,554 --> 00:49:17,554
Duncan, tell your boys
to drop their guns off over in Kate's wagon.

664
00:49:17,642 --> 00:49:19,555
I've got an idea
they wouldn't do that.

665
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,295
I'm tellin' ya they will.

666
00:49:22,382 --> 00:49:24,295
Never had so many deputies before.

667
00:49:28,775 --> 00:49:32,036
<i>Look over there.</i>

668
00:49:32,123 --> 00:49:34,167
<i>I've got more,
but you can't see 'em.</i>

669
00:49:34,254 --> 00:49:36,863
Gentlemen, peace is declared.

670
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,516
What about them?

671
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:43,777
All right, everybody! Over at Kate's wagon,
and drop off your hardware.

672
00:49:43,865 --> 00:49:46,952
<i>You deputies too!</i>

673
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,171
All right, men,
drop your guns in the wagon.

674
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,218
Hey, Duncan?

675
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:19,175
Cut out a bunch of your cows a while ago.
You want the calves branded?

676
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,872
I'll take that as a favour.

677
00:50:25,307 --> 00:50:26,177
Where's its mother?

678
00:50:26,264 --> 00:50:28,916
Got separated somehow.

679
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:31,613
- How do you know this one
doesn't belong to me?
- We don't...

680
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,614
so we're dividing up the doubtful ones:
Half for you and half for us.

681
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,180
- Can you think of anything better?
- That's fair enough.

682
00:50:42,484 --> 00:50:45,093
- Acts just like you
when you won't listen to reason.
- Oh?

683
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,747
If you'd settle down
and talk things over...

684
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:52,052
- you might find there's room
enough here for all of us.
- Could be.

685
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:57,095
You're the prettiest little maverick
I ever did see!

686
00:50:57,183 --> 00:50:59,272
How 'bout lettin' me
put my brand on ya?

687
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:01,489
Thanks.
I'm wearing one already.

688
00:51:01,576 --> 00:51:05,360
You gotta get used to sudden changes.

689
00:51:05,446 --> 00:51:07,924
[Woman Screams]

690
00:51:08,012 --> 00:51:10,055
- Hey!
- "[Screams]"

691
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,798
Get outta here!

692
00:51:23,884 --> 00:51:26,493
Stop it! Stop it!

693
00:51:46,932 --> 00:51:48,193
What's the idea?

694
00:51:51,932 --> 00:51:53,455
[Gunshot]

695
00:51:55,543 --> 00:51:56,847
[Gunshot]

696
00:52:04,762 --> 00:52:07,198
Stampede! Stampede!

697
00:52:10,286 --> 00:52:12,415
Mount up and head 'em off!

698
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:42,943
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

699
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,599
Whoa! Whoa!
[Whistling]

700
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,210
Whoa! Whoa!

701
00:53:12,819 --> 00:53:15,341
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

702
00:53:27,257 --> 00:53:29,213
Duncan!

703
00:53:29,301 --> 00:53:32,213
Get your men together and clear out.
We've had enough trouble here.

704
00:53:32,301 --> 00:53:34,432
Nobody talks to me like that.

705
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:37,476
That's a Federal court order
talking to you like that.

706
00:53:37,562 --> 00:53:40,129
You better go.

707
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:43,389
Call the men in.
Tell them I've gone back to the ranch.

708
00:53:45,608 --> 00:53:48,913
- Can you finish this round-up
in one more day?
- There's a chance.

709
00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:51,522
Well, then, get movin'.

710
00:54:15,396 --> 00:54:18,005
Well, there's the last one.

711
00:54:18,093 --> 00:54:20,527
Round-up's over.

712
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,834
- How's the round-up?
- It's over. Your men standing by?

713
00:54:27,921 --> 00:54:31,225
Yeah. When do we move?
Averell will give us the word.

714
00:54:32,922 --> 00:54:35,444
# Oh, where have you been #

715
00:54:35,531 --> 00:54:38,444
# Billy boy, Billy boy #

716
00:54:38,531 --> 00:54:41,314
# Oh, where have you been #

717
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:44,924
# Charmin' Billy #

718
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:47,750
# I have been to seek a wife #

719
00:54:47,837 --> 00:54:51,490
# She's the darlin' of my life #

720
00:54:51,533 --> 00:54:54,491
# She's a young thing #

721
00:54:54,534 --> 00:54:58,230
# And cannot leave her mother ##

722
00:54:59,709 --> 00:55:03,145
Hi, Maverick.
How goes it with law and order?

723
00:55:03,231 --> 00:55:06,232
- Not much change.
- There never is any change with you.

724
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:09,668
Don't you ever sing or dance,
or feel like kickin' up your heels?

725
00:55:09,754 --> 00:55:11,885
Come on. Dance with me.

726
00:55:11,972 --> 00:55:14,016
I wish I knew what
to think about you.

727
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,930
If I ride off, it'll be too late.

728
00:55:17,016 --> 00:55:19,496
Still talking about going away?

729
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:23,322
About ready to turn in
my badge and saddle up.

730
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:27,063
What's holding you back?

731
00:55:27,106 --> 00:55:29,150
Nothin', I reckon.

732
00:55:29,237 --> 00:55:33,194
I hope it turns out
to be as green as you think-

733
00:55:33,238 --> 00:55:37,238
- the grass on... the other side of the fence.
- "[Gunshot]"

734
00:55:37,325 --> 00:55:39,935
Hold still, everybody!

735
00:55:40,022 --> 00:55:42,848
Just stay like that and
there won't be any trouble.

736
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:51,762
I'm takin' you to
the marshal at Rawlins.

737
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,850
- What for?
- For rustling cattle...

738
00:55:54,937 --> 00:55:58,112
- and murdering my foreman,
Wade Burrows.
- That's ridiculous!

739
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:00,286
- What are you trying to start here?
- Keep out of this, Averell.

740
00:56:00,373 --> 00:56:04,200
I'm in this all the way,
and you better have plenty of evidence.

741
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:08,462
There's enough evidence
to hang her six times over.

742
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:10,941
Come out to the corral.

743
00:56:15,811 --> 00:56:18,289
<i>[Duncan] Found him out on the range
near my north section...</i>

744
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:22,944
<i>stretched out near a brandin'fire
with two holes in his back.</i>

745
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:25,205
They never gave him a chance.

746
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:28,509
Wade Burrows was a troublemaker.
It just caught up with him.

747
00:56:28,596 --> 00:56:32,858
- What's the connection with Kate?
- I'll show you right now.

748
00:56:32,946 --> 00:56:35,728
Every time I complained to you
about losin' branded cattle...

749
00:56:35,816 --> 00:56:41,034
"you'd talk about strange faces in the hills,
and rustlers nobody ever sees.

750
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,121
I'll show ya some rustlers.

751
00:56:47,252 --> 00:56:50,991
That's my brand,
the Bar-Double-Check.

752
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:54,166
<i>When we picked up Wade,
there was a brandin'iron under him.</i>

753
00:56:54,254 --> 00:56:56,167
<i>I reckon the killers forgot that.</i>

754
00:56:56,254 --> 00:56:59,342
Here's the iron.

755
00:56:59,428 --> 00:57:01,603
And here's what it does.

756
00:57:04,516 --> 00:57:06,908
<i>K- Bar-M.</i>

757
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,126
I'm takin' you in on suspicion
of rustlin' and murder.

758
00:57:12,213 --> 00:57:16,475
The sheriff's office is still filled, Duncan.
Don't try to do my job.

759
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:19,693
- This woman is goin' to jail!
- "But I'll do the takin'."

760
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:23,389
I trust you, Duncan, but you got
a vigilante look in your eye.

761
00:57:23,475 --> 00:57:26,911
He'd put a rope around her neck
as soon as they got out of sight.

762
00:57:26,998 --> 00:57:29,304
Don't worry, honey.
I'll get you the best...

763
00:57:29,391 --> 00:57:32,523
legal representation in
the territory of Wyoming.

764
00:57:32,609 --> 00:57:34,522
By the time these charges are heard...

765
00:57:34,609 --> 00:57:37,436
<i>Mr Duncan'll have to eat a lot of words.</i>

766
00:57:37,479 --> 00:57:41,176
- Am I right, boys?
- "[Man] You bet."

767
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:45,394
Your deputies must be tired
after the round-up...

768
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,655
so I know you'll be glad
if I post some of my men at the jail...

769
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,177
to see she doesn't get away.

770
00:57:56,092 --> 00:57:59,962
There'll be more in jail
when I found out which of ya
have been takin' orders from her.

771
00:58:03,224 --> 00:58:06,355
You haven't said a word
for the last 15 minutes.

772
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:09,399
You used to find it easy to talk.
Why not now?

773
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:12,617
Talking to you
never helped me before.

774
00:58:12,703 --> 00:58:14,747
What's the truth, Kate?

775
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:17,226
Is Averell playin' you,
or are you both playin' me?

776
00:58:17,313 --> 00:58:21,618
Things were bad enough in this town
before you came. They're twice as bad now.

777
00:58:21,705 --> 00:58:24,357
You think I'm a murderer
and a rustler?

778
00:58:24,445 --> 00:58:27,706
I don't know what to think.

779
00:58:27,793 --> 00:58:30,707
What's between you and Averell?

780
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:36,230
Too much.

781
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:56,712
Keep your eyes peeled for trouble.

782
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,670
Want these gents barbecued
or slow-fried?

783
00:59:00,756 --> 00:59:04,236
Don't get the idea
"you're deputies, boys.

784
00:59:04,322 --> 00:59:08,236
Anything happens to her,
"you'll pay for it.

785
00:59:17,063 --> 00:59:18,977
You might as well catch 40 winks.

786
00:59:19,064 --> 00:59:22,587
- Tomorrow could be a big day.
- I'll stay here.

787
00:59:22,674 --> 00:59:27,022
- You can't help her. She's locked up.
- I'll stay here!

788
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:29,153
<i>[Hoof Beats]</i>

789
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:36,720
Kinda wondered why
he wasn't around.

790
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,895
<i>[Averell]
I wouldn't put it past Reece Duncan...</i>

791
00:59:38,982 --> 00:59:41,808
<i>to kill one of his own men
and pin it on us.</i>

792
00:59:41,895 --> 00:59:44,896
What his second move will be,
I can only guess.

793
00:59:44,983 --> 00:59:47,765
L-I'm too busy thinking about Kate...

794
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:50,114
sitting over in that jail.

795
00:59:52,898 --> 00:59:56,289
[Wally] Seems to me we got nothing to go
on but her own word that she's innocent.

796
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:02,812
<i>- "We brought in"
300 unbranded mavericks...
- How did it work?</i>

797
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,248
Fine. She was so surprised
she couldn't say a word.

798
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:08,249
<i>[Averell]
Go back and tell 'em to get set.</i>

799
01:00:08,335 --> 01:00:11,945
<i>You'll see the signal as soon
as it's light enough to see smoke.</i>

800
01:00:12,031 --> 01:00:15,118
There isn't much hay over there.
You'd better drag over another bale.

801
01:00:15,206 --> 01:00:18,250
Go on.

802
01:00:18,336 --> 01:00:22,860
I say Kate had nothin' to do with it.
She's innocent as a newborn babe!

803
01:00:22,946 --> 01:00:26,425
All right. If nobody'll back me up
to bust her outta that jail...

804
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:29,557
- I'll do it myself.
- I don't think you'll have time.

805
01:00:29,644 --> 01:00:32,252
Boys, I just got
some pretty bad news.

806
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:35,557
Sandy tells me Duncan's calling in
every man he's got.

807
01:00:35,644 --> 01:00:40,080
He's getting set for a fight,
and he'll find a good reason to start one.

808
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:42,472
I'm going out there
and try and talk him out of it.

809
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,909
- I never heard of Duncan
bein' talked out of anything.
- Maybe so.

810
01:00:46,995 --> 01:00:51,953
At least it'll give you men a chance
to get organized for a battle.

811
01:01:27,872 --> 01:01:30,569
See that nothin' happens to her.

812
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:39,091
As miserable a collection of faces
as ever I seen off a reward poster.

813
01:01:39,178 --> 01:01:42,657
What kind of records did you gents have
before you went to work for Duncan?

814
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:45,832
Smart aleck!
Don't pay him no heed.

How do you like that?
They got suspicions.

820
01:02:00,357 --> 01:02:02,793
I've got a good mind
to spill this stuff on the floor.

821
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:14,012
Quiet outside, but I'm kinda dry inside.
Gimme some of that!

822
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:18,317
Just a minute.
I kinda changed my mind about you fellas.

823

I'm gonna like this!

825
01:02:31,233 --> 01:02:33,842
Nice work, Knuckles.
Pick him up.

826
01:02:33,928 --> 01:02:36,364
You got me covered.

Hey, ain't this somethin'? Ajailbreak!
We're bustin' ya outta here.

828
01:02:42,757 --> 01:02:44,931
- Who organized it?
- We did. The sheriff's outta town.

829
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:46,931
Jim's ridin' up to Duncan's ranch.

830
01:02:46,974 --> 01:02:51,279
Jim found out Duncan's gettin' ready
for a fight. He's gonna try and stop him.

831
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:55,021
- Don't you believe it!
- In ya go!

832
01:02:55,107 --> 01:02:58,239
He doesn't want to stop a war.
He wants to start one.

833
01:02:58,325 --> 01:03:00,848
Boys, I think it's about time
"you knew the truth.

834
01:03:00,934 --> 01:03:03,109
I've been covering up
for Jim Averell in one of...

835
01:03:03,195 --> 01:03:06,109
the slickest rustling schemes
Wyoming ever saw.

836
01:03:06,197 --> 01:03:09,110
And the idea back of the whole thing
is to start you...

837
01:03:09,197 --> 01:03:11,676
<i>and the big cattle raisers

838
01:03:11,762 --> 01:03:14,894
I told you she mightn't be innocent.

839
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:17,459
You didn't finish.
We're still listenin'.

840
01:03:17,546 --> 01:03:19,938
Jim's got a bunch of gunslingers
up in the hills.

841
01:03:20,025 --> 01:03:24,243
And one of them, or Sandy, killed Wade
Burrows to pin the whole thing on me...

842
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:26,504
<i>and start this big range war
that he wants.</i>

843
01:03:26,591 --> 01:03:29,896
He sure did pin it on ya. How many times
that brandin' iron been used?

844
01:03:29,984 --> 01:03:34,462
I don't know, but the important thing is
he wants to start a range war.

845
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:38,506
Boys, I know Jim Averell and you don't.
He wants to be Governor.

846
01:03:38,594 --> 01:03:41,942
He doesn't care how many people he
walks over to get to the Governor's chair...

847
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:44,116
<i>or how many he kills to stay there.</i>

848
01:03:44,203 --> 01:03:46,291
I don't believe anything she says,
good or bad.

849
01:03:46,377 --> 01:03:49,987
- Shut up!
- Boys, you've got to believe me.

850
01:03:50,074 --> 01:03:52,161
He's got this whole thing worked out!

851
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:56,858
- What's he doing at Duncan's?
- Duncan's as big a sucker as any of us.

852
01:03:56,944 --> 01:04:00,599
Jim made him want to fight,
and he's gone up there to push him into it.

853
01:04:00,686 --> 01:04:03,208
I wish somebody would get over
to that case of rifles...

854
01:04:03,295 --> 01:04:06,556

- I'll talk to you inside.

If you came here to talk for Kate Maxwell,
"you're wastin' your time.

858
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,518
Kate doesn't need anybody
to talk for her.

859
01:04:39,606 --> 01:04:43,041
- She's probably out of jail by now.
- I don't think so.

860
01:04:43,084 --> 01:04:46,998
- I left five of my men there.
- Hope they're alive.

861
01:04:47,085 --> 01:04:49,390
Duncan, the settlers are talking fight.

862
01:04:49,477 --> 01:04:51,478
They're gonna end this
by wiping you out.

864
01:04:53,782 --> 01:04:56,348
I'd hate to be around
when she sends them out here.

865
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,305
They'll smoke you and your men out,
and knock you over like rabbits.

866
01:04:59,348 --> 01:05:04,916
Maybe, unless I crack down on them first
with a few ideas of my own.

868
01:05:08,482 --> 01:05:11,482
- Call the men in.
- Right.

869
01:05:12,612 --> 01:05:17,049
I suppose your story's pretty straight,
Mr Averell.

870
01:05:17,135 --> 01:05:21,093
- Now I'd like to know
how straight you are.
- Use your head.

871
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:23,093
Why are we fighting each other?

872
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:25,833
Neither of us really have
anything in common with these settlers.

873
01:05:25,919 --> 01:05:28,876
We live in a different world.
We live a different life.

874

whose side do you think I'll be on?

875
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,052
Theirs or ours?

876
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:37,052
You're a real high-minded citizen
to be looking for the governorship.

877
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:40,009
- I'm for Jim Averell.
- I see that.

878
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:44,227
- So after all your big talk,
"you're double-crossin' 'em.
- That's not a nice word.

879
01:05:44,314 --> 01:05:47,227
How do I know you're not
double-crossin' me?

880
01:05:47,314 --> 01:05:50,272
You don't.
It's a big chance, isn't it?

881
01:05:50,315 --> 01:05:52,576
Which reminds me.
While we're here talking...

882
01:05:52,663 --> 01:05:56,577
- we're giving them
more time to get organized.
- That time's about up.

883
01:05:56,664 --> 01:05:59,186
They want a fight,
I'll bring it to them.

884

You're comin' along, Mr Averell.

885
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:09,710
If anything goes wrong,
I'll have you right under my guns.

886
01:06:16,364 --> 01:06:19,930
Ned, get all the hands in from the range.

887
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:23,062

- I'm not gonna stop ya.

I'm gonna join ya like Averell's done.

892
01:07:04,503 --> 01:07:07,330
How have you managed to keep
"your outlaw friends under cover so long?

893
01:07:07,418 --> 01:07:09,852
- What outlaws?
- Wanna tell him?

894
01:07:09,939 --> 01:07:12,984
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The outlaws working for him.

895
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:16,637
- The ones that killed your foreman
and stole your cattle.
- That's a lie!

896
01:07:16,724 --> 01:07:19,594
- If it isn't Averell-
- No use arguing now.

897
01:07:19,682 --> 01:07:22,594
We'll find out.

898
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:33,858
If there's going to be a fight
with Duncan's men, we know we're
going into it with clean hands.

899
01:07:33,945 --> 01:07:37,945
But let's keep it clean all the way.
The first shot must come from him.

900

And if it does, well,
"you boys know how to fight back.

901
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,294
- Here they come!
- Now, remember:

902
01:07:43,338 --> 01:07:45,642
Duncan's boys must be
the first to start.

903
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,253
Duncan, you've got about a minute
to make up your mind.

904
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,905
Throw in with the settlers,
and I think we can prove our friend here...

905
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:01,471

every one of us.

906
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:04,602
Start battlin', and the outlaws
will wipe out the town.

907

Seems to me a man of your position,
with all you have at stake...

01:08:26,216 --> 01:08:28,304
You didn't spend much time in jail.

912

- We're gonna have a party.

01:08:38,653 --> 01:08:41,045
A mite different from
the one Mr Averell planned on...

916
01:08:41,131 --> 01:08:44,263
but he's gonna be the host.

917
01:08:44,349 --> 01:08:46,742
- Get off.
- What for?

918
01:08:46,828 --> 01:08:49,567
The man spoke to ya.

919
01:08:53,742 --> 01:08:58,613
Some odd characters in the hills
are waiting for him to tell them
we're killing each other.

920
01:08:58,657 --> 01:09:00,831
All right, tell them.

921
01:09:00,918 --> 01:09:03,092
I don't know what you mean.

922
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:05,614
The smoke signal, Mr Averell.

923
01:09:05,701 --> 01:09:09,050
You're supposed to light
that stack of hay as soon as we
start throwin' lead at each other.

<i>Then they come riding in

- "let him have it."
- Right.

01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,641
Jim, grab on!

967
01:16:37,616 --> 01:16:39,442
Leaving?

968
01:16:40,573 --> 01:16:42,835
Pointing a gun at me again, Kate?

969
01:16:42,922 --> 01:16:46,227
I ought to kill you,
but I'd rather see you hang.

970
01:16:46,313 --> 01:16:51,010
- Now, Kate!
- You lying, sneaking, murdering-

971
01:16:51,096 --> 01:16:54,837
They'll be piling in here in a minute, Kate.
You gotta let me go.

972
01:16:54,924 --> 01:16:57,577
Why?
For what you've done to me?

973
01:16:59,969 --> 01:17:02,273
For what I used to mean to you.

974
01:17:02,318 --> 01:17:04,666
That was an idea I had.

975
01:17:04,752 --> 01:17:07,101
But you were never like the idea.

976
01:17:08,145 --> 01:17:10,884
Well, uh, the good times we had.

977
01:17:10,972 --> 01:17:13,058
We had good times.

978
01:17:13,146 --> 01:17:15,668
<i>Think about them, Kate.</i>

979
01:17:15,755 --> 01:17:18,668
<i>What are you gonna gain if I die?</i>

980
01:17:18,755 --> 01:17:23,104
You'll never see me again!
You got Stan Blaine, and-

981
01:17:25,626 --> 01:17:28,191
Did I kill him, Kate,
when I had a chance?

982
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:33,279
<i>When you asked me not to,
Kate, did I kill him?</i>

983
01:17:33,367 --> 01:17:35,889
There's another reason
"you gotta let me go.

984
01:17:37,932 --> 01:17:41,237
Look, Kate. Look at this.

985
01:17:42,846 --> 01:17:46,021
How can I believe anything you've said?
The last time-

986
01:17:51,196 --> 01:17:53,197
<i>[Rifle Shot]</i>

987
01:18:12,245 --> 01:18:15,418
- Let's listen to him, boys.
- Thank you.

988
01:18:15,505 --> 01:18:18,115
I think we can
give credit for this to...

989
01:18:18,202 --> 01:18:21,245
<i>Cattle Kate!
I've come to realize...</i>

990
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:25,725
that I've got to consider
"your interests as well as mine.

991
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:29,987
<i>If you want to make a friend of me,
think of my interests as well as yours.</i>

992
01:18:30,074 --> 01:18:34,943
<i>"The West is gettin'smaller, friends, and I
reckon we've gotta learn to live together.</i>

993
01:18:34,987 --> 01:18:39,814
<i>Now, I'm not the kind of man that'll throw
away the things that I worked hard for.</i>

994
01:18:39,901 --> 01:18:42,032
- Who gave you that?
- He did.

995
01:18:42,075 --> 01:18:45,425
- Where is he?
- Saddling up.

996
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:56,383
Where to, Maverick?

997
01:18:56,469 --> 01:19:01,339
Could be California,
maybe Oregon Territory.

998
01:19:01,427 --> 01:19:05,124
- Do you still think I was
Jim Averell's woman?
- That's how it looked.

999
01:19:05,211 --> 01:19:09,298
Because I cried?
Sure, I cried, but not because I love Jim.

1000
01:19:09,386 --> 01:19:12,256
I cried because when I found you
I realized I was all the things...

1001
01:19:12,343 --> 01:19:15,083
I never wanted to be, and because-

1002
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:19,431
Oh, what do you know about women
or the way they feel?

1003
01:19:31,085 --> 01:19:33,303
There's a piece of bottom land
a few miles down.

1004
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:36,956
Good for homesteadin'.
Let's have a look at it.
