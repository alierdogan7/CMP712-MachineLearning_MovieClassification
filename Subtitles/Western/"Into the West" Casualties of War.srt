3
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,600
Go, go, go!

4
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Well, jake...

5
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,700
what do you make of it?

6
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,600
It's an indian sacred place...

7
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,600
like a church.

8
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,565
The hell you say.

9
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,065
You may tell your readers, gentlemen,

10
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,200
that this expedition has thus far
exceeded my most sanguine expectations.

11
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,500
We have discovered a rich
and beautiful country.

12
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,000
Abundant game, fertile land.

13
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,800
In short, all the bounties necessary
for the establishment of civilization.

14
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:58,600
The laramie treaty of '68 made this
indian land, general custer,

15
00:02:58,635 --> 00:03:01,600
part of the great sioux reservation.

16
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,700
Now, the sioux, they may not
take too kindly to trespassers.

17
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,365
I shall recommend the
extinguishment of indian

18
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,200
title at the earliest moment
practicable for military purposes.

19
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,600
If congress should support the
settlement of the black hills, gentlemen,

20
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,800
rest assured, the army will do its duty.

21
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,100
Whoo!

22
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:26,600
Gold!

23
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,900
Gold! Gold!

24
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,100
Jake, come on!

25
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,900
Pay dirt, boys.

26
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,700
Gold! Gold! Gold!

27
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,200
Officially, the army brass had
sent custer into the black hills

28
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:11,417
to map out the site of a new fort

29
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,565
to protect the northern railroad,

30
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,300
and though the gold he'd found didn't
amount to more than a 50 cent diggin',

31
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,102
it wasn't long before the newspapers

32
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:23,300
proclaimed the place "the
el dorado of america."

33
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,900
Everyday, new immigrants came in
hope of striking their fortune.

34
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,065
Like so many before them,

35
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,800
most brought only their dreams
and the clothes on their backs.

36
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:38,900
Some would make a new life for themselves.

37
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,900
Others would find only heartbreak.

38
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,200
With the people came
the towns and the camps, hundreds of 'em.

39
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,965
For every man who got rich on gold,

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,600
another 10 made a killing on the miners.

41
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,500
Nobody seemed to care that the
land wasn't theirs to claim.

42
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,365
Some men of business, like robert wheeler,

43
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,100
found themselves in the
right place at the right timE.

44
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,300
The opportunities seemed downright endless.

45
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,500
One at a time, gentlemen, one at a time.

46
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,965
Please don't shove.

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,600
There's enough to go around.

48
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,700
How do you get to the black hills?

49
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:15,800
Freedom trial.

50
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,800
$10.00'll get you a ride in my wagon.

51
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,600
-$10.00?
-Yes, sir.

52
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,100
It cost me half that by train from chicago.

53
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, sir, you can wait until they
build a railroad to the black hills,

54
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,700
or you can hand over $10.00 and hop on.

55
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,900
Yeah? All right.

56
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,100
Who needs pans?

57
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,700
There ya go.

58
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,700
I trade with the sioux at the agency.

59
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:54,200
They know me as a friend.

60
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,700
They'll give us safe passage.

61
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,800
Whoa, whoa.

62
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,065
What about them?

63
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,500
They friends of yours, too?

64
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,100
Those aren't indians.

65
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,800
Bushwhackers!

66
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,465
Red cloud had won for his people,

67
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,100
the protected place in the sacred lands.

68
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,465
Now the country promised forever

69
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,200
to the lakota was being
overrun with white men.

70
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:37,600
For hot bloods like red lance

71
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,265
and his brother voices that carry.

72
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,700
The time for fighting was drawing near.

73
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,900
"Gentlemen may cry peace! Peace!"

74
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,465
"But there is no peace."

75
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,300
"The war has actually begun."

76
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,165
All right,

77
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,700
now do you see this exclamation point that
mr. Patrick henry put there after "begun"?

78
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,600
A little stronger next
time, hans, but very good.

79
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,500
Mr. Kurtz?

80
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,065
"Is life so dear or peace so sweet "

81
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,300
as to be purchased at the
price of chains and slavery?

82
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:42,100
Forbid it, almighty god!"

83
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,400
Very good!

84
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,900
Very good.

85
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,365
Very good.

86
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,665
I think that's enough for today.

87
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,700
And you all need to be gettin' home,
so, I will see you next sunday.

88
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,865
Oh, children...

89
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,700
your gifts are so sweet,
but entirely unnecessary.

90
00:11:57,735 --> 00:11:59,200
Now, please, just git and go.

91
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,100
Git.

92
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:00,700
Shoo.

93
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,150
You put in paper like so,

94
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,900
touch the keys, and presto!

95
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,100
Out comes the letter with all
the quality of newspaper print.

96
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,900
Behold.

97
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,565
With this device

98
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,165
and a little manual prestidigitation,

99
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,100
the tedious labor of business
correspondence may be cut in half.

100
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,100
Most ingenious.

101
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,900
May I put the lady
proprietress down for an order?

102
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,000
-I'll take one!
-Yes, sir.

103
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,765
Ohh.

104
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,000
Pickin's were good out there, clara.

105
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,100
Better than I expected.

106
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,800
Ran out of supplies
before I ran out of miners.

107
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,100
I figure it'll require a trip to omaha,

108
00:13:28,135 --> 00:13:30,100
maybe kansas city to restock.

109
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
I won't have you goin'
back into those hills!

110
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,465
I couldn't sleep for the worry,

111
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,300
not knowin' whether you were alive
or out moulderin' on the plains somewhere.

112
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,200
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

113
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,100
I didn't mean to cause you grief, clara.

114
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,365
It's just...

115
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,900
I have ambitions for both of us.

116
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
One day, you'll have a proper gold band,

117
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:08,767
not some old saddle ring.

118
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:11,000
Iron is stronger.than gold.

119
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,500
I wouldn't trade this ring for the world.

120
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:16,717
It was made for a simple purpose,

121
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:18,900
just like the man who gave it to me.

122
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,900
What's wrong?

123
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,000
Somethin' happened.

124
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,200
What happened?

125
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,500
I killed 2 men.

126
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,700
I looked down the barrel of my sharps...

127
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,200
and I thought I'd never see you again...

128
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,900
So I shot.

129
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,300
Even though I didn't have to.

130
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
So much for purpose, I suppose.

131
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,400
It will be very hard

132
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,400
for our government to keep
the whites out of the hills.

133
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,800
To try to do so

134
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,900
will give your people and
my government great trouble.

135
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,065
Because the whites

136
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,600
who may wish to go into
these hills are very numerous.

137
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:38,500
I want our great father to send us meat

138
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,200
and flour and coffee.

139
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,700
And sugar and tea and bacon

140
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,800
and corn and beans and tobacco.

141
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,200
I want this for all the
people and for the children

142
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:59,417
and 7 times their children.

143
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:01,600
Firm offer is $400,000 a year

144
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,765
for the mineral rights.

145
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,165
Now if you should wish to
sell the black hills outright,

146
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,200
the price will be $6 million
payable in 15 annual installments.

147
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:12,800
I will go to the white father

148
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,900
in washington and smoke pipe with him.

149
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,365
You have heard his words,

150
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,500
which cannot be altered
even to the scratch of a pen.

151
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:42,773
Die hard this

152
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,000
just shy of a hundred.

153
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,500
Been a while.

154
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,100
Buffalo harder to find than a job.

155
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,300
Southern herd's almost gone.

156
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,700
What are you asking?

157
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,100
$3.00 per. You buyin'?

158
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,000
I can offer you a dollar per hide,

159
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:13,200
and I consider that more than fair.

160
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,100
I consider that to be robbery with
a smile under a high top hat, hillman.

161
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,465
Last time the price was $6.00.

162
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,100
The rage for buffalo bedspreads and
other accoutrements back east has ended.

163
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,800
Most definitively.

164
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,500
Leave the buffalo to their extinction, sir.

165
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,400
They've served their purpose.

166
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,500
On the train from new york to hillsgate,

167
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:36,800
I saw the future-- bones.

168
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,600
Bones?

169
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,400
Buffalo bones.

170
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,750
The detritus of sporting
men lured by a $3.00 rail

171
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:46,400
pass and the promise of
game there for the taking.

172
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,600
Carcasses left to rot
create a mighty stench.

173
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,565
But in that smell,

174
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,100
an enterprising man may
detect the odor of money.

175
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,700
Bones can be ground to make
fertilizer and fine china,

176
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,500
and that's only the beginning.

177
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,800
Why, a man can earn himself 8, 9,

178
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,100
perhaps as much as $10 a ton.

179
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,900
Damn it!

180
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,065
I broke away from my father

181
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,200
so that we could have a life together,

182
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:28,700
and I mean to make it a good one.

183
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,500
I know, but your dreams are not your own.

184
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,200
They're your father'S.

185
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:35,700
Clara,

186
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,400
all the money we made on the miners

187
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,150
we lost on the hides.

188
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,492
I wouldn't be gone long.

189
00:18:41,527 --> 00:18:42,800
You're gone often enough.

190
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,400
Give me a reason to stay.

191
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,765
You spend all your time

192
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,600
wet-nursing those squareheads.

193
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,965
Robert.

194
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,065
You know it makes me sick to my stomach

195
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,100
to see--to see it sometimes,
to see you teaching

196
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:00,565
those damn kids

197
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,500
when you're too afraid to
have another child of your own!

198
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,800
I'm sorry.

199
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,200
I didn't mean it.

200
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:17,900
Yes, you did.

201
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,000
Come on. Hyah!

202
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,100
I can't afford to feed
them I've already got,

203
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,600
and now the government sends me more.

204
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,800
-Sign here to accept custody.
-Yeah.

205
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,265
Since the time of washita,

206
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,750
margaret light shines remained
a prisoner of the long knives,

207
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:42,242
who herded their captives from
camp to camp like so many cattle.

208
00:20:42,277 --> 00:20:46,700
She became mother to the many
children left orphaned by war.

209
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,865
They were her blessings,

210
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,900
and she promised to never
leave them unprotected.

211
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,000
Ain't buying any more hides.

212
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,000
Not buying?

213
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,900
Not selling 'em.

214
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,100
Watch it.

215
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,400
Go on.

216
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,100
I commend you, sir.

217
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,100
Captain pratt, tenth cavalry.

218
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,900
Robert wheeler.

219
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,200
Allow me to say, mr. Wheeler,

220
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,900
that you are the exception
that proves the rule.

221
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,900
And what rule is that, captain?

222
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,800
I find the majority of traders
to be unprincipled, unscrupulous rogues.

223
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,450
A pack of veritable scoundrels,

224
00:22:26,485 --> 00:22:28,200
if you don't mind my saying so.

225
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,800
That's a fine sentiment

226
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,100
coming from a man who makes widows
and orphans his stock and trade.

227
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,300
Call me a rogue?

228
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,100
Perhaps we both are, mr. Wheeler.

229
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,465
We've denied these people fraternity.

230
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,800
We've driven them from
their ancestral homes.

231
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,500
It just costs the people of our government

232
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:48,100
hundreds of millions of dollars

233
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,000
and led to the present shameful impasse.

234
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:53,100
Just can't stop progress, captain.

235
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,300
What is progress but what men do?

236
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,500
Most men do what they will,

237
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,600
others what they deem to be right.

238
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,400
Where do you stand, mr. Wheeler?

239
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,800
Well, to be honest with you, sir,
sometimes I'm not so sure.

240
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,400
Now that is a promising
beginning to a man's education.

241
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,000
Good day, mr. Wheeler.

242
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,300
This is the best I can do for you.

243
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
Rations are the first of every month.

244
00:23:28,335 --> 00:23:29,817
No.We will not beg.

245
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:31,300
You suit yourself.

246
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,100
But you be damn sure you and
these other squaws stay put.

247
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,900
Orders went out

248
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:44,200
that any indian that's not on agency land
by january 31 will be considered hostile.

249
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,900
Are you savvy?

250
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,800
We will not make trouble for you.

251
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:49,300
Well, you already have.

252
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,900
this is our home now

253
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,950
Sitting bull sensed the
spirits of the long knives

254
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:24,600
who had been sent to
capture him and his people

255
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:27,400
and force them to live like white men.

256
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,000
He sought a vision to prepare
himself for the great struggle.

257
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,500
He promised a scarlet blanket
of his own blood to wakan tanka.

258
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,100
listen to this:

259
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,365
"General george armstrong custer,

260
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,600
"dressed in a dashing suit of buckskin, "

261
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:36,665
is prominent everywhere,

262
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,200
"taking in everything connected
with his command with the keen,"

263
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:42,100
incisive manner for which
he is so well known."

264
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,100
Ha ha!Yeah, well, ain't
every command's got its own

265
00:27:45,135 --> 00:27:47,800
pet newspaper man tagging along.

266
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,000
I want you, reno, and benteen to
follow their trail up the rosebud.

267
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,465
Gibbon and I will march up the yellowstone

268
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,100
to a blocking position here
at the mouth of the little bighorn.

269
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,200
Now don't be greedy, custer.

270
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,300
There's indians enough for all of us.

271
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,900
Wait for us.

272
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,700
No, I don't think I will.

273
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,600
Answer me something.

274
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,700
If you think custer's so infernal bad,

275
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,500
why do you ride with him?

276
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,400
It's better to know a devil
and confound his purpose

277
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,100
than to just leave him be.

278
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,265
The vision of sitting bull

279
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,265
inspired many warriors
to leave the reservation.

280
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,500
They pledged themselves to the
death to defend the sacred paha sapa.

281
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,465
Sitting bull moved the people

282
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,000
to the banks of the river
called "the greasy grass,"

283
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,300
where the game was plentiful.

284
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,100
There the warriors readied themselves.

285
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,700
They waited for the day the
sky would rain long knives.

286
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,600
What did you see, mr. Wheeler?

287
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,600
Horses.

288
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,165
Horses?

289
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,900
More than i could count, sir.

290
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,300
Looked like a brown wave across the hills,

291
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:14,000
just on the other side of little bighorn.

292
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
We will strike the village immediately.

293
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,400
Sir, with all due respect,

294
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,400
I think it best that we wait
for our reinforcements to arrive.

295
00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:29,300
I will not risk the chance
of our quarry escaping.

296
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Major reno will lead
his men across the river

297
00:29:32,235 --> 00:29:34,200
will all due haste to
flush out the hostiles.

298
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,400
I will lead 5 companies north
to cut off the indians' retreat.

299
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,500
Yes, sir.

300
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,265
If I go to other side,

301
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,200
I go as crow, not white man.

302
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,500
Deliver this to captain
benteen in our left flank.

303
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,600
He is to join the attack after
we have engaged and routed the enemy.

304
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,065
Yes, sir.

305
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,600
What are they doing?

306
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,400
Bad omens.

307
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,000
They see death.

308
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,900
You've done your work.You found the sioux.

309
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,600
If you're so afraid of them, go now.

310
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,700
Leave the fighting to us.

311
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,200
Looks like us reno boys
get the honors today, jake.

312
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,700
Major's offering 30 days furlough
to the man who takes the first scalp.

313
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,800
I want you to take this.

314
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,700
If anything happens, you make
sure it gets delivered to my folks.

315
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
Sure thing, jake.

316
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,000
Hey, jake.

317
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,400
Least we ain't ridin'
with ol' hard ass custer.

318
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,100
Good luck to you.

319
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:25,500
You, too.

320
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,000
That day, there would be many battles.

321
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,200
First came the man renO.

322
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,765
Indians, they had told him,

323
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,400
would run at the fearful
sight of his horse hooves.

324
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,300
But these indians did not run.

325
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,800
The scouts had spoken
to the long hair,custer,

326
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,965
but he had no ears.

327
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,300
He was certain of his great victory.

328
00:32:43,335 --> 00:32:44,665
He led his men toward those

329
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,900
he knew would be escaping the battle,

330
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:48,900
but met only warriors.

331
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,600
The hunter was about to become the hunted.

332
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,165
The fighting on the ridge,

333
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,700
lasted no longer than a hungry
man takes to eat his meal.

334
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,600
The vision of sitting bull had come to pass.

335
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,800
The long knives, have
fallen into his village.

336
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,365
The people did not heed sitting

337
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,300
bull's warnings to leave the
soldiers' possessions untouched.

338
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,500
Sitting bull knew these matters
weighed heavily with wakan tanka.

339
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,850
While many celebrated,

340
00:36:55,885 --> 00:36:57,900
others sang death songs.

341
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,300
Congress and the army better do something,

342
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:01,000
and damn quick, too!

343
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,200
Kill every one of them
bloodthirsty heathens, I say!

344
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,500
This town's been sitting on a
powder keg better part of a year.

345
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,000
Only a matter of time
before it finally exploded.

346
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,000
Storekeep!

347
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,700
You give me a gun and all the ammo you got!

348
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:17,165
We're closed, sir,

349
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,800
out of respect for the dead.

350
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,300
It's horrible to think of
children coming into such a world.

351
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,100
What happened to the baby wasn't your fault.

352
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,300
You're a good mother, clara.

353
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,400
Yes.

354
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,100
Only...

355
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,500
don't shut me out.

356
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,000
The baby was-

357
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,900
he was my son, too.

358
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,100
I'm sorry.

359
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,400
I'm so sorry.

360
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,600
so am I.

361
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,800
I salute you, sir.

362
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,450
You're a hero.

363
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:48,165
Thank you, sir.

364
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,800
Let me give you some food.

365
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,550
Thank you kindly.

366
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:53,100
Sir, here you are.

367
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,600
Here you go.Good job.

368
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,900
-For you.
-Thank you, ma'am.

369
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,900
God bless you.

370
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,600
This town got a postmaster?

371
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,200
That'd be me.

372
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,400
You're first civilization we've seen since-

373
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,300
what can I do for you, trooper?

374
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,100
I, uh...

375
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,000
promised a friend his folks would get this.

376
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,800
I'll see to it.

377
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,200
He was a good man.

378
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,300
He always spoke well of his family.

379
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,800
Please take this.

380
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,200
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

381
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,800
Dearest mother and father,

382
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,600
I'm off on a fool's mission and
cannot be certain of the outcome.

383
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,100
There's not time for me to write
all the things I wish to tell you.

384
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,065
Many a time have I thought
to abandon my charge

385
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,000
here rather than submit to
the willfulness of others

386
00:42:20,035 --> 00:42:22,200
who have been placed above me.

387
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,500
I want you to know that
I've always tried to act

388
00:42:24,535 --> 00:42:26,500
according to the lessons of duty and honor

389
00:42:26,535 --> 00:42:28,400
that have been your legacy to me.

390
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,400
I've traveled far

391
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,700
and seen too much,

392
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,900
but always I think of home.

393
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,000
You are both in my prayers.

394
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,200
I remain forever your loving son, jacob.

395
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,600
-Can I help you, ma'am?
-yes

396
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,400
We're looking for the person who sent this.

397
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,900
Robert?

398
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,600
He was your son?

399
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,700
Yes.

400
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,300
I'm sorry.

401
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,500
The man who gave you the letter-

402
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,500
did he tell you anything?

403
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,500
Only that your son was a good man

404
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,200
and he loved his family.

405
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,500
Thank you.

406
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,000
I want to see the place where it happened.

407
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,000
The battlefield's 2 days by wagon, ma'am.

408
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,700
That's perilous country.

409
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,300
The army can't vouch yet for its security,

410
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,100
and there's no telling
where your son might lie.

411
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,700
We'll pay you anything you ask.

412
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,000
Please?

413
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,000
Keep your money.

414
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,300
Do you have any children?

415
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,700
I had a son.

416
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,300
A beautiful boy.

417
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,900
William.

418
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,400
A fever took him.

419
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,300
Life is very fragile.

420
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,400
Most of the things I
ever loved have been taken from me.

421
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,900
Do you love your husband?

422
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,000
With all my heart.

423
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,600
Then always hold that love close to you.

424
00:45:00,635 --> 00:45:02,500
Let it sustain you.

425
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,500
Like this.

426
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,200
I heard tell of a jacob wheeler.

427
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:21,000
Well, there are wheelers
scattered all over this country.

428
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,600
They say that this one...

429
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,000
took off with a mountain man.

430
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,400
Married an indian woman.

431
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,100
Grandfather used to tell
me stories about him.

432
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,400
What kind of stories?

433
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,900
About how he rode with
fremont to california.

434
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,500
Struck it rich.

435
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
Well, if a man lives long enough,

436
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,765
he gets to hear the stories

437
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,500
and the legends folks tell about him.

438
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,400
I reckon I've lived that long.

439
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,700
Maybe too long.

440
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,800
I need some tobacco.

441
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,550
Find my son,

442
00:47:12,585 --> 00:47:14,400
wakan tanka.

443
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,700
Take his hand and lead him
on his journey across the hanging roaD.

444
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,165
Let his spirit

445
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,300
and the spirits of all these young men

446
00:47:27,335 --> 00:47:29,400
who died before their time

447
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,900
shine like the stars in the sky.

448
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,400
There may we mothers find them and say, "

449
00:47:39,435 --> 00:47:41,600
there.

450
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,900
That is my son."

451
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:39,200
Many long knives came to avenge
the death of the man called custer.

452
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,750
Because they could not find
crazy horse and sitting bull,

453
00:48:42,785 --> 00:48:46,200
their anger fell on those
already on the reservations.

454
00:48:46,235 --> 00:48:47,765
The great council in washington

455
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,200
declared all indians to be prisoners of war.

456
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,865
The lakota, they said,

457
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,000
had broken the promise of the treaty paper.

458
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,600
The most sacred of sacred
lands, the paha sapa,

459
00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:02,200
promised forever to the lakota people,

460
00:49:02,235 --> 00:49:05,017
now belonged to the white man,

461
00:49:05,052 --> 00:49:07,800
and he would never give it back.

462
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,300
Loved by the buffalo had
begun to see the truth

463
00:49:14,335 --> 00:49:18,100
of growling bear's vision,
and it pained his heart.

464
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,500
He felt the loss of the power of wakan tanka

465
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,665
and knew that the time was soon coming

466
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:31,100
to return to his people without having
found the answers he had sought for so long.

467
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,000
Mr. Wheeler.

468
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,400
Captain pratt.

469
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,700
You remember.

470
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,100
Well, not likely to
forget our last encounter.

471
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,200
"Exception to the rule"
I believe you called me.

472
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,600
Not only that, I see,
but a man of many skills.

473
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,900
Nah, this just keeps
breath and bone together.

474
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,500
I come from a family of wheelwrights.

475
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,000
Your business prospers?

476
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,600
Ice storm killed most
of the cattle last year.

477
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,300
Destroyed most of the wheat.

478
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,500
Drought finished off the rest.

479
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,365
Farmers who bought goods on credit,

480
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,600
they had nothing left to sell or barter.

481
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,100
Nature can be a stern taskmaster.

482
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,700
The whole idea of a general
store's becoming obsolete.

483
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,465
Man can find everything he needs nowadays

484
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,700
in montgomery ward or sears
and roebuck catalogues.

485
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,100
Everything but purpose, mr. Wheeler.

486
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,100
I guess.

487
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,800
Well, can I offer you a
brandy and cigar, captain,

488
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:58,000
or do you abstain from ardent spirits?

489
00:50:58,035 --> 00:50:59,700
I should, but I do not.

490
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,700
Thank you, mr. Wheeler.

491
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,400
I had occasion to observe
your classroom today, mrs. Wheeler.

492
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,100
Your way with children is commendable.

493
00:51:09,135 --> 00:51:10,300
Well, thank you.

494
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,200
The parents bring so many of
their old ways and prejudices.

495
00:51:14,235 --> 00:51:16,067
If you don't help the children early on,

496
00:51:16,102 --> 00:51:17,900
they'll never adjust to their new lives.

497
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,500
My view precisely.

498
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,565
Thank you.

499
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,200
You mentioned a proposition.

500
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:26,700
Yes.

501
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,200
Indeed.

502
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,200
It is a great mistake

503
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,100
to think that the indian is
born an inevitable savage.

504
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,100
He is born a blank like the rest of us.

505
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,300
Left in the surroundings of savagery,

506
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,500
one naturally becomes a savage.

507
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,500
But transfer the savage-born infant

508
00:51:49,535 --> 00:51:51,265
to the surroundings of civilization,

509
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,300
and he will grow to possess a
civilized language and habit.

510
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,165
President hayes and the congress

511
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,506
have granted me the use of barracks in

512
00:52:00,507 --> 00:52:03,600
carlisle, pennsylvania,
for a model indian school

513
00:52:03,635 --> 00:52:06,965
and authorized me to recruit 125 children

514
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,800
from here and the territories
for its inaugural class.

515
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,865
Well, that's so far away.

516
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,400
Surely the reservation is a better place.

517
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,400
The reservation works
to colonize the indian,

518
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,300
not individualize him.

519
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,000
If the indian is to be assimilated,

520
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,800
he must be gotten into the
swim of american citizenship.

521
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,865
He must feel the touch of it day after day

522
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,000
until he becomes saturated
with the spirit of it.

523
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,350
Immerse the indian in
the waters of civilization

524
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:38,300
and hold him there until
he is thoroughly soaked.

525
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,600
In short, sirs, by being
placed in good schools,

526
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,200
taught our language and industries
and going out among our people,

527
00:52:47,235 --> 00:52:49,400
your children can become useful americans.

528
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,965
You see yourselves the evidence

529
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,500
that this is now the white man's land,

530
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,165
and there's nothing left for you

531
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,700
and your children but to
become a part of it all.

532
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,900
White man--smart.

533
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,600
He speak many promises.

534
00:53:04,635 --> 00:53:06,900
More and more.

535
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,265
White man keep one.

536
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,450
He say he take our land.

537
00:53:11,485 --> 00:53:13,600
Now he take our land.

538
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,065
And why was that land taken?

539
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:19,100
Because you can neither read nor write.

540
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,100
Because you are not educated.

541
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,300
These mountains, valleys,
and streams have passed from you.

542
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:29,300
The people who take these mountains,

543
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,165
these valleys,

544
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,400
these streams-- they steal, they lie.

545
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,800
If you were all as smart as the white man,

546
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,500
you would've known that there
was gold in the black hills

547
00:53:41,535 --> 00:53:43,500
and led your people to dig it out.

548
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,127
You leave your affairs in
the hands of the white man.

549
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,900
This is why you come to grief.

550
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,700
The white man will walk right over you

551
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,600
unless you get up
and stand in front of him as his equal.

552
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,500
The way to do this is to get his education.

553
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,300
You see that I do not come with soldiers

554
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,100
to take your children from your very arms.

555
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,000
I believe there are wise men among you

556
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,600
who will themselves allow their
fortunate sons and daughters

557
00:54:14,635 --> 00:54:17,400
to partake in the white man's learning.

558
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,200
You believe that much in pratt's idea?

559
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,600
I believe in us.

560
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,100
I believe in what we can do together.

561
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,700
After all that's happened?

562
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,200
I want to stop dwelling in the past.

563
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:32,400
Everything I have that's precious
is right here in this moment.

564
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,200
Fortitude, mrs. Wheeler.

565
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,200
Our task awaits.

566
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,700
Move 'em out!

567
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,500
I was telling yo I'll take that.

568
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,900
There.

569
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,200
You're gonna be all right.

570
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,200
Come on, boy.

571
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,200
Easy, child.

572
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,100
Don't make this more difficult.

573
01:01:43,135 --> 01:01:44,400
Just scared.

574
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,000
Do you see these marks?

575
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,300
Each word is a white man's name.

576
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,000
You will choose one of
these names for your own.

577
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,700
Begin, please.

578
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,400
Hirum.

579
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,800
Meredith.

580
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,600
Walter.

581
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,100
Carol.

582
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,700
George.

583
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:01,600
Abigail.

584
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,650
Come along, children.

585
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:10,842
Get your clothes.

586
01:03:10,877 --> 01:03:12,000
Right this way.

587
01:03:12,035 --> 01:03:12,867
Move.

588
01:03:12,902 --> 01:03:13,700
For you.

589
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,100
Find a bed.

590
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,900
Keep moving.

591
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,600
Take these and put them on.

592
01:03:18,635 --> 01:03:20,500
Move along.

593
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,800
Find a bed.

594
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,800
Get your clothes. Keep moving.

595
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,900
Move.

596
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,300
Move along.

597
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,700
Keep moving.

598
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,800
Go in that rooM.

599
01:03:36,835 --> 01:03:38,400
Find a bed.

600
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,300
Get your clothes.

601
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,700
Go in that room.

602
01:03:44,735 --> 01:03:45,900
Find a bed.

603
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,500
Stop that boy, mr. Wheeler!

604
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,400
Don't let him get away!

605
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,500
Come on now!

606
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,700
I got him!

607
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,300
This is to be expected of some of them.

608
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:24,200
An indian man only cuts his hair
in times of great mourning.

609
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,350
But surely if it's their tradition-

610
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:28,200
- old habits must be unlearned.

611
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,300
The sooner the better.

612
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,400
Thank you, everyone.

613
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,800
Back to your duties.

614
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,600
Quickly now.

615
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,200
You, too, mr. Wheeler.

616
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,500
Mrs. Wheeler.

617
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,100
Is it right what we're doing?

618
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,100
It all made so much sense.

619
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,000
We have to give it more time, clara.

620
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,500
Captain pratt's a decent man.

621
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,700
He knows what he's doing.

622
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:29,900
compassionate to

623
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,600
The universe is made of circles.

624
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:16,100
No beginning and no end.

625
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:28,500
The cross touches the circle four times.

626
01:10:28,535 --> 01:10:30,600
Yesterday, you were indians.

627
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,500
Today, you are americans.

628
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:38,300
Hereafter, you will not
speak in your native tongue.

629
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,700
You will speak only english.

630
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:44,100
Our purpose here at the
carlisle indian industrial school

631
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,400
is to make you ready to take a usefu
place in the white man's world.

632
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,500
There are 4 directions, 4 virtues.

633
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:07,100
Remember, there is no shame in hard work.

634
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,200
In work, there is freedom.

635
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,000
Make the most of your time here.

636
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,700
You have no right to waste your own.

637
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,500
Still less, the time of others.

638
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:21,600
Each of us is born with one of thesE.

639
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:27,200
All of you must find the
other three within you.

640
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,000
Dismissed.

641
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,100
My great grandfather

642
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:47,700
made and fixed wheels as
he marched with washington.

643
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,500
George washington?

644
01:11:51,535 --> 01:11:53,100
Potomac?

645
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:56,800
Cherry tree?

646
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,900
Uh, forget it.

647
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,100
Let me show you how a wheel's made.

648
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,800
- Hub.
- Hub.

649
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,500
- Spokes.
-Spokes.

650
01:12:05,535 --> 01:12:06,700
All right?

651
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,500
- Wheel.
- Wheel.

652
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,700
George, why don't you give it a try?

653
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,300
All right...

654
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,800
find "A."

655
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,500
Now "B."

656
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,600
Good.

657
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,100
Please, continue.

658
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,700
And "c?"

659
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,500
Go ahead, george, you were doing so well.

660
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,600
Outside.

661
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,400
Now you listen to me, young man-

662
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,400
unbutton your jacket.

663
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,000
Now!

664
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:17,100
He stole barbed wire from your shop
and made these for other boys.

665
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,765
If we succeed, mr. Wheeler,

666
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,365
carlisle will be the model for dozens,

667
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,300
perhaps even hundreds
of other indian schools

668
01:14:29,335 --> 01:14:30,600
all over the country.

669
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,300
I believe that if we can turn george around,

670
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,300
we can turn around the
most recalcitrant of them.

671
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,265
I agree.

672
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,000
I just wonder if a slower
transition wouldn't be--

673
01:14:41,035 --> 01:14:43,300
there is no time left for half measures.

674
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:46,900
To save the child, we must kill the indian,

675
01:14:46,935 --> 01:14:49,600
fully and completely.

676
01:16:55,994 --> 01:16:57,400
Very good.

677
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,000
Remember what you learned.

678
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,100
I cannot abide that man.

679
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,600
How can he be so right and
so wrong at the same time?

680
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,200
Bite it.

681
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,400
bite it!

682
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,600
bite it!

683
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,700
chiew.chiew!

684
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,000
Never speak indian again!

685
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,100
Never!

686
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:12,000
You get your spokes set,
now attach your felloes, make your rim.

687
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,700
Where's george?

688
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,400
George?

689
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,000
"Lesson 24: The story teller.

690
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,865
"Peter parley was a great storyteller.

691
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:38,200
"This is known to all children
who have read his bookS.

692
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,100
I thought they might be sick.

693
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,900
Are you sick, boy?

694
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,700
The younger boys were no doubt corrupted.

695
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,000
But george is a different matter.

696
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,565
With all due respect, captain,

697
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,200
don't you think you might be
asking too much of these children?

698
01:20:02,235 --> 01:20:03,200
Too much?

699
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,700
You demean them, mr. Wheeler.

700
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,465
We don't demand the germans, for instance,

701
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:11,200
become thoroughly american before
we admit them to this country.

702
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,300
They arrive on our shores old and young,

703
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,600
and must become americans at once.

704
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,000
We don't feed our
civilization to immigrants,

705
01:20:20,035 --> 01:20:22,200
we feed immigrants to our civilization.

706
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,000
So let it be with the indian.

707
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,500
Give me the chance to bring george around.

708
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,200
I think I may have some currency with him.

709
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,300
Very well, mr. Wheeler.

710
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,965
I have come to the regrettable realization

711
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,700
that you no longer share
my views on education,

712
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,500
but I'm willing to accede to your methods.

713
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,500
This once.

714
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,800
Captain pratt reminds me of my father.

715
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,800
He's an immovable wall.

716
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,900
I wonder that he may
not be right in the end.

717
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,700
Will our child say that about you?

718
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,500
George.

719
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,700
You are welcome.

720
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:00,600
I know you can understand
some of what I say...

721
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:04,200
and whatever you think,

722
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,800
captain pratt means well for your people.

723
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:08,100
No.

724
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,400
I'm a simple man...

725
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,500
but I know this:

726
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,500
Knowledge is power.

727
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,300
And if you don't study our ways,

728
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,300
how will your great grandchildren
know the meaning of your holy wheel?

729
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,200
How will they know of your history?

730
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,400
Of your great victories?

731
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,900
We tell these things.

732
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,000
That's not enough, george.

733
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:44,965
See, because

734
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,200
what we call history is written
by those who win the battles.

735
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,800
So you must make your voice heard.

736
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:55,400
You must preserve your culture.

737
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,800
You must write it down...

738
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,500
in english.

739
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:02,800
Not for pratt,

740
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,000
but for your children and their children...

741
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,165
why I do what you tell me?

742
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:14,200
White men say many things, mean nothing.

743
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,400
That is true of some white men...

744
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,500
and some indians, I expect.

745
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,300
You're a young man, george.

746
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:30,600
Believe me, I know the nature
of a young man's dreams.

747
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,700
Don't stop dreaming.

748
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,000
But remember, when you wake up,

749
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,200
you're back in a white man's world.

750
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,700
You have dream?

751
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,700
I still got a few left.

752
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:58,000
Maybe it's not too late to make them happen.

753
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:14,100
And it is my considerable pleasure

754
01:24:14,135 --> 01:24:16,265
on this signal occasion

755
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:19,400
to introduce our commencement theatrical,

756
01:24:19,435 --> 01:24:20,565
colombia's roll call,

757
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,200
presented by the students of
our own mrs. Clara wheeler.

758
01:24:24,235 --> 01:24:26,000
A round of applause, please.

759
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:37,800
Are we the same voice,
who, with trinkets and toys,

760
01:24:37,835 --> 01:24:40,100
moccasins, blankets, and paint,

761
01:24:40,135 --> 01:24:42,217
and a costume most quaint,

762
01:24:42,252 --> 01:24:44,026
on the sixth of october,

763
01:24:44,061 --> 01:24:45,765
the long journey over,

764
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,000
came to this friendly roof, six months ago?

765
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,765
Yes, we are the very same

766
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,965
who to these good barracks came,

767
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,400
where kindly friends a welcome gave us,

768
01:24:58,435 --> 01:25:01,800
did all they could to teach and save us,

769
01:25:01,835 --> 01:25:04,565
from idle habits and bad ways,

770
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:08,800
and carried us safely
through the maze of reading,

771
01:25:08,835 --> 01:25:11,065
writing, and of talking,

772
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:14,100
and even improved our walking.

773
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:16,900
Heralds of fame and history,

774
01:25:16,935 --> 01:25:18,665
unroll your scroll of mystery,

775
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,350
then with your silver trumpets last,

776
01:25:21,385 --> 01:25:23,642
unloose the shut gates of the past

777
01:25:23,677 --> 01:25:25,865
and call colombia's heroes fourth,

778
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:29,300
proclaim them east, west, south, and north.

779
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:36,100
Then boomed the pinta's signal gun,

780
01:25:36,135 --> 01:25:37,400
the first that ever broke,

781
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
the sleep of that new world,

782
01:25:40,035 --> 01:25:42,065
the sound echoing to

783
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:45,800
forest depths profound, a continent awoke.

784
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:50,300
I see a train of exiles stand
amid the desert desolate,

785
01:25:50,335 --> 01:25:52,665
and the fathers of massachusetts land,

786
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:57,600
the daring pioneers of fate
who braved the perils of sea and earth...

787
01:25:57,635 --> 01:25:59,267
you've taken our rivers and mountains

788
01:25:59,302 --> 01:26:00,900
and the plains where we loved to roam.

789
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,900
Banish us not to the mountains,

790
01:26:02,935 --> 01:26:04,565
and the lonely wastes for home,

791
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:08,800
our clans that were strongest
and bravest are broken

792
01:26:08,835 --> 01:26:10,400
and powerless through you.

793
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,700
Let us join the great tribe of  white men

794
01:26:12,735 --> 01:26:15,400
as brothers to dare and to do.

795
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:21,800
And still the ways of peace we would follow,

796
01:26:21,835 --> 01:26:25,665
sow the seed and the sheaves gather in.

797
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,800
Share your labor, your
learning, your worship,

798
01:26:28,835 --> 01:26:31,867
a life larger, better, to win,

799
01:26:31,902 --> 01:26:34,751
then foeman no longer nor aliens,

800
01:26:34,786 --> 01:26:37,643
but brothers indeed we will be.

801
01:26:37,678 --> 01:26:40,839
And the sun find no citizens truer,

802
01:26:40,874 --> 01:26:44,000
as he rolls to the uttermost sea.

803
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,300
You disappoint me, mr. Wheeler.

804
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,700
Comes from my trying to
please people too much.

805
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:19,400
But a man's gotta stand for something,

806
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,500
or he doesn't count for much.

807
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:24,400
And what do you stand for, mr. Wheeler?

808
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,800
Do you even know yourself?

809
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,500
I do...now, sir.

810
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:34,700
It's time for me to go home...

811
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,000
where I can do some good...

812
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,700
my own way.
