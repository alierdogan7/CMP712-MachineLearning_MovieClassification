1
00:00:02,675 --> 00:00:03,861
Everybody get a move on!

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:06,230
We're loading on the run!

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,331
Head for the tree line!

4
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:09,767
Fall back!

5
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:11,201
We'll make our stand on the ridge.

6
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:12,469
Cover your backs!

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,139
Come on, let's go!

8
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:16,755
Don't stop!

9
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,292
Here they come!

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,931
Come on!
Come on, let's go!

11
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:40,249
Come on.

12
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:17,901
I'll cut them damn buttons
off, randall.

13
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:19,502
Makes you a target.

14
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:21,305
At least I can stay warm at night.

15
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:24,174
How are you still keeping
your britches up?

16
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:25,460
Nature provides.

17
00:01:31,764 --> 00:01:33,317
Over here!

18
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:36,435
Take cover and reload!

19
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,459
You're gonna lose that arm.

20
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,817
I'll give the arm.

21
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:09,004
Just want to live.

22
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,925
Here they come!

23
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,178
Don't shoot!

24
00:02:16,643 --> 00:02:17,694
Hold fire.

25
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:21,016
Hold fire.

26
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:22,565
Yankee cavalry coming.

27
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:25,568
Company strength.

28
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:26,736
Yankee cavalry coming.

29
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:29,706
Company strength.

30
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:32,910
This could be it, anse.

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,880
Best make your peace.

32
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,784
Yeah, well, I never courted
god before, randall.

33
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:43,602
I doubt he'll hear me now.

34
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:46,423
On the left!

35
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:47,673
On the left!

36
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,011
Can't hold this.

37
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:00,337
Get the boys back to the line.

38
00:03:00,587 --> 00:03:02,057
Tell them to leave the pistols
with me.

39
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,976
Soldier, on your feet now!
Move!

40
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,395
We're moving out!

41
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,562
Them that's got sidearms,

42
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,773
put them in this sack here.

43
00:03:10,197 --> 00:03:12,984
Come on, let's move!

44
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,985
Go on.

45
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:18,782
I'm a faster runner than you are.

46
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:24,394
Hey, anse.

47
00:03:24,644 --> 00:03:27,332
I'll pray for you.

48
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:31,837
We're moving out!

49
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,491
Make it stop.

50
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:56,059
Make the hurt stop.

51
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,029
Oh, oh, hey.

52
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,946
Make it go away.

53
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,985
That's it.

54
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:24,069
Yeah, that's good.

55
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:55,337
I'll take some of them
biscuits and beans.

56
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:59,622
Got your sidearms back for you.

57
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:03,493
Well, I'll be.

58
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:04,994
How many yanks you kill, devil anse?

59
00:05:05,244 --> 00:05:07,764
How'd you get away, captain?

60
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:09,881
Damn miracle.

61
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:44,950
Anse.

62
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,039
What do you think you're doing?

63
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:52,075
Well, I ain't stayin' to watch
the boys we just saved

64
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:53,520
die for a lost cause.

65
00:05:54,193 --> 00:05:55,612
Lost?

66
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:57,880
You don't believe that.

67
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,401
I do.

68
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,684
Come on, what do you think
would happen

69
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:02,919
if every soldier decided for himself

70
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:05,555
when the war was lost?

71
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:08,825
Be shorter wars for sure.

72
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:10,260
Don't make a cause no better,
randall,

73
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,330
when good men die for it in vain.

74
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,598
From here on out,
I fight only from home.

75
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:16,199
We're your home.

76
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,101
You can't just twist things
to suit yourself.

77
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:19,702
This is desertion.

78
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:23,140
I don't look at it that way.

79
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:29,613
I figure I deserted my family
when I signed up.

80
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:31,641
You'd be wise to come with me.

81
00:06:32,164 --> 00:06:33,950
You took an oath, anse.

82
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,437
We swore "death before dishonor."

83
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,480
Nothing changes that.

84
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,191
What if I'm on that firing squad
that has to put you down?

85
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:45,262
Well, if it comes to that,
don't flinch.

86
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:48,013
This is wrong.
I can't let you do this.

87
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,173
You take care of yourself, randall.

88
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:58,256
Many thanks for today.

89
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,811
God hates deserters.

90
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:19,062
You ought to buy your dog
a drink, uncle jim.

91
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:22,999
And a little of this.

92
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:24,716
And a little of that.

93
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:31,140
Smell good too, don't you?

94
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,258
Damn dog.

95
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:40,668
You get that coat off a dead yankee?

96
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,688
No, I did not.

97
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:50,059
You find it in an outhouse
somewheres?

98
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:54,264
No, I did not.

99
00:07:54,514 --> 00:07:57,367
Where'd you get it then?

100
00:07:57,617 --> 00:08:00,953
I wore it throughout the rebellion.

101
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,112
My nephew,

102
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:12,282
"devil" anse Hatfield,

103
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:17,820
proudly serves these here
confederate states of america,

104
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,090
as does your brother randall.

105
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,127
Yet you dare come in here

106
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:28,064
and wear that
goddamned bluebottle jacket,

107
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:30,716
you son of a bitch?

108
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:37,140
Near as many around these parts

109
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,678
are fighting and dying for the union.

110
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:45,649
As for me, war is passed,

111
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,718
but I ain't got another jacket.

112
00:08:48,968 --> 00:08:54,758
Howsomever, being as how I'm
getting a little hot in here,

113
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:56,244
I will take it off.

114
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:06,671
Put it on my charge.

115
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:10,239
You're gonna throw that damn
yankee jacket on the floor,

116
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:12,552
and you're gonna piss on it.

117
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,811
I'm going on home.

118
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:20,216
Don't much care for
the perfumed stank in here.

119
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:22,018
Can't even pay for your drink.

120
00:09:22,268 --> 00:09:24,187
What kind of a damn man are you?

121
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:25,855
The kind who, you wanna come after,

122
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:29,158
you'll find ready, Jim Vance.

123
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:31,661
Unlike your kinfolk here,

124
00:09:31,911 --> 00:09:33,162
i'm not afeard of no man

125
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:38,870
on account of he uses his dog
for a whore.

126
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:44,459
Leave it now, uncle jim.

127
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:48,345
Do you bluebellies know
the penalty for thievery?

128
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:49,379
Please, sir.

129
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:51,214
We were just really hungry.

130
00:09:51,464 --> 00:09:52,482
That's all.

131
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:54,083
Please.
Please, sir.

132
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,118
We were just-

133
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:57,887
I don't want to hear it.
You just keep walking.

134
00:09:58,137 --> 00:09:59,557
I got a good plan for you boys.

135
00:10:02,508 --> 00:10:05,194
Quit your lollygaggin'.

136
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:07,278
Git.

137
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:14,655
Oh, my god!

138
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,740
Where you taking 'em, uncle jim?

139
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,775
Anse Hatfield, you're back!

140
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:22,455
Hold up, you bastards.

141
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:25,181
Guarding the home front, I see.

142
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:26,416
Yep.

143
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,294
You know nothing gets by old jim.

144
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:32,137
I caught these yankee shit heels
a'pilfering corn.

145
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:36,860
He meant to take your life, nephew.

146
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,060
I never.
We was just hungry.

147
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,562
I saw murder in his eye.

148
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:41,599
Please, sir.
Don'm t hit lekill me.

149
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:48,872
On your way, yankee bill.

150
00:10:49,122 --> 00:10:50,039
Go on.

151
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:52,124
And I'd hurry it up.

152
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:15,264
And I thought you was letting him go.

153
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:16,467
So did he.

154
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:21,438
After you blew out
the other one's brainpan,

155
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:23,907
what choice did I have?

156
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:25,374
Yep.

157
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:29,605
Don't want to leave no witnesses.

158
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,248
Died unafraid,

159
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:34,350
how a man should die.

160
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,487
That's a damn shame.

161
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:40,423
That yankee piss pot
should've suffered.

162
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:42,158
Yeah, well, you hate 'em so much,

163
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:46,162
how come you didn't sign up
to fight 'em?

164
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:48,965
Fighting on others' terms
is how you lose,

165
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:54,270
and losin' is intolerable to me.

166
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,576
Well, I'm back now
and still head of this family.

167
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:01,511
I ain't gonna be no problem.

168
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:03,145
Good.

169
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:04,614
Then you'll understand
when I tell you

170
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:05,949
to get these bodies off the road,

171
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:09,318
somewhere no one ever finds 'em.

172
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:11,020
Yeah.

173
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,941
It's gonna be like it was before.

174
00:12:19,212 --> 00:12:21,615
Lookit Mr. Howls over there,
all smilin'.

175
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:23,325
He's glad you're back too...

176
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,721
With all your fine plans.

177
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:35,212
Get the bodies off the road.

178
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:45,955
What were you doing in there anyhow?

179
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:49,018
Not even home yet and you get
yourself into a drunken fight,

180
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,426
you shiftless fool.

181
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:52,094
I'm hidin' out at the still

182
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:54,463
till this ruckus with Jim Vance
blows over.

183
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:56,399
You'll drink yourself to death
up there.

184
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:59,068
I ain't going up there to die.

185
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,871
I'm going up there to stay alive.

186
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:03,540
Ain't right.

187
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,341
Come home from the army,

188
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:07,010
breedin' me like I was cattle,

189
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,245
then you take off again?

190
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:12,697
No, you've got your duties
as a husband and father.

191
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:16,519
Kids, mind your mama while I'm gone.

192
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,603
We will.

193
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:22,319
Levicy.

194
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:25,447
Anderson?

195
00:14:37,383 --> 00:14:38,585
I'm done with the war.

196
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:50,113
You ain't going back?

197
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:51,390
I've given enough.

198
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:55,584
I'm back for good, darling.

199
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:59,989
Lord, you lived through it.

200
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:01,817
How's our little boy?

201
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:07,096
He's an angel now that he's asleep.

202
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:08,131
Ngobbi

203
00:15:08,381 --> 00:15:11,200
oh, my god, look at you.

204
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,869
You'll want to know

205
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,837
that we got at least 60 bushels
of corn in last year,

206
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:16,539
so we ain't starvin',

207
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,474
and this year promises to be
just as good,

208
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:19,809
so you don't have to worry none,

209
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:22,027
and johnse, you will not recog-

210
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:28,566
We'll get to all that come morning.

211
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:58,930
Hey!

212
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:07,289
Ain't that martha McCoy?

213
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:08,884
'Lias.

214
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,943
Miss McCoy.

215
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,979
Suppose you heard about my harmon.

216
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:34,316
He's up at that still over
a month, drinking.

217
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:36,370
Says if'n he stops now,

218
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,686
he'll throw a fit and be helpless

219
00:16:37,936 --> 00:16:40,923
when Jim Vance come to kill him.

220
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:42,524
Ma'am, your yankee husband
was a traitor

221
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:46,829
to more than just my uncle jim.

222
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:48,497
There's lots of folks around here

223
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:51,200
can't forgive harmon's betrayal
and might-

224
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,402
Might want to kill him,

225
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:55,347
even some of your own kin.

226
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:59,742
But your uncle Jim Vance is
the only one my harmon accused

227
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:03,612
of fornicating with his hound dog.

228
00:17:03,862 --> 00:17:06,149
Well...

229
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:08,584
That's a poor choice of words.

230
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:13,490
I'll admit, hidin' out was prudent.

231
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,494
I can't survive being a widow.

232
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,369
My uncle tends to go his own way.

233
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:30,239
But next time I see him,

234
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,323
i'll do what I can.

235
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,766
Nancy, sit down.

236
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:43,746
I hear ya!

237
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:48,699
Ya ain't getting me,
you son of a bitch!

238
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,393
Pappy?

239
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,510
Pappy?

240
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:50,689
Pappy?

241
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:56,244
"Dear randall,

242
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:59,406
"our fortunes are bitter.

243
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:03,451
"Your brother harmon
was done murdered,

244
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:06,397
"it is said by Hatfields.

245
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:10,802
"The rest of us barely scrape by.

246
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:14,672
"If you are still alive,
dear husband,

247
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:19,811
"i pray that you come home
to us soon.

248
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:23,463
Your loving wife, sally."

249
00:20:28,338 --> 00:20:29,269
It's over!

250
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,108
The war is over!

251
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,361
General lee surrendered!

252
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:35,896
- Praise the lord!
- The war is over!

253
00:20:36,146 --> 00:20:37,998
Thank you, thank you, jesus.

254
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:39,448
Now, I'll be damned.

255
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,510
Won't be over for some.

256
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,449
War was a goddamn waste.

257
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:58,067
I don't intend to waste the peace.

258
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:12,026
Who's there?

259
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:14,110
Now turn around.

260
00:22:19,582 --> 00:22:21,047
Randall?

261
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:27,041
Sally, it's me.

262
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,543
You've aged some.

263
00:22:29,793 --> 00:22:32,046
Yankees done it.

264
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:35,728
Treated us worse than animals
in that prison.

265
00:22:40,603 --> 00:22:43,486
I didn't want to give up on
you, husband, but I think I did.

266
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:52,299
First we log my ten acres here-

267
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:57,959
Run from the ridge across
and outside that hill.

268
00:22:58,355 --> 00:23:00,074
Then?

269
00:23:00,324 --> 00:23:01,504
We take the money from that.

270
00:23:01,754 --> 00:23:04,044
We buy 20 more acres.

271
00:23:04,294 --> 00:23:06,613
Then what?

272
00:23:06,863 --> 00:23:08,164
Buy 40 more.

273
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:14,588
It's like wiping your ass
with a wagon wheel.

274
00:23:14,838 --> 00:23:16,372
Ain't never gonna end now, is it?

275
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:19,727
Mr. Hatfield.

276
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:22,896
I'm a cousin of randall McCoy,
an attorney.

277
00:23:23,146 --> 00:23:28,202
My name is Perry Cline.

278
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:33,286
I studied law at the offices of
ethan mckibbin in louisville.

279
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:36,777
Passed the bar last october.

280
00:23:37,027 --> 00:23:39,834
I apologize for any unpleasantness

281
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:41,248
we're about to have.

282
00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:44,051
Just state your business, mr. Cline.

283
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:45,685
Now, I know you believe

284
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:47,687
you own this stand of timber

285
00:23:47,937 --> 00:23:51,024
and have the right to cut.

286
00:23:51,274 --> 00:23:57,131
Whereas, in fact, in the eyes
of the law, you do not.

287
00:23:57,381 --> 00:23:59,666
Where in thunder did you get that?

288
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:05,568
My daddy bought this parcel
off of bucky hand in 1859.

289
00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:07,445
I got the deed in a box at home.

290
00:24:07,695 --> 00:24:10,744
I believe you, Mr. Hatfield.

291
00:24:10,994 --> 00:24:12,712
But he sold my cousin rutherford,

292
00:24:12,962 --> 00:24:15,382
whose estate I administer,

293
00:24:15,632 --> 00:24:21,388
the timber rights beforehand
on june 22, 1858.

294
00:24:21,638 --> 00:24:25,793
Signed and witnessed, see?

295
00:24:26,043 --> 00:24:27,795
Well, bucky was a friend
of my family.

296
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:32,732
He'd have told us if we'd not
bought the timber with the land.

297
00:24:32,982 --> 00:24:36,891
You'll force me to sue, mr. Hatfield.

298
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:40,103
You'll be liable for damages

299
00:24:40,424 --> 00:24:43,310
and the cost of all my timber
you have cut to date.

300
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,565
You will lose.

301
00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:49,116
That a threat?

302
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:52,490
I reckon it's safer you sue.

303
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,455
Without they hear different
from a judge,

304
00:24:55,705 --> 00:25:01,195
my relatives might think you
just tried to bamboozle me.

305
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:03,330
Well...

306
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,733
I've informed you of my rights.

307
00:25:07,463 --> 00:25:11,338
We'll see what the law
has to say about it.

308
00:25:11,588 --> 00:25:12,854
I bid you good day.

309
00:25:41,418 --> 00:25:46,173
I'm prepared to do my duty
as your wife,

310
00:25:46,423 --> 00:25:51,044
but I ask that you spill
your seed outside of me.

311
00:25:51,294 --> 00:25:53,384
I could not bear another birth.

312
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:32,757
<i>Alas and did my savior bleed</i>

313
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:37,457
<i>and did my sovereign die</i>

314
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:39,893
<i>would he devote</i>

315
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:42,495
<i>the sacred head</i>

316
00:26:42,745 --> 00:26:47,188
<i>for such a worm as I</i>

317
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:50,337
<i>at the cross, at the cross</i>

318
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:52,772
<i>where I first saw the light</i>

319
00:26:53,022 --> 00:26:55,409
<i>and the burdens of my heart</i>

320
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,615
<i>rolled away</i>

321
00:26:58,195 --> 00:27:00,580
<i>it was there by faith</i>

322
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,283
<i>I received my sight</i>

323
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:05,518
<i>and now I am happy</i>

324
00:27:05,768 --> 00:27:08,042
<i>all the day</i>

325
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:13,560
<i>alas and did my savior bleed</i>

326
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:18,631
<i>and did my sovereign die</i>

327
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:21,347
<i>would he devote</i>

328
00:27:33,062 --> 00:27:34,681
Well, then, take care.

329
00:27:34,931 --> 00:27:36,216
Now, good see you again.

330
00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:37,884
Nice to see you.

331
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:41,388
Randall, good to see you.

332
00:27:41,638 --> 00:27:43,523
Now, take care.
Thank you so much.

333
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:45,774
Randall!

334
00:27:47,944 --> 00:27:52,628
Randall!

335
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:55,802
Oh, now, stop fighting.

336
00:27:56,052 --> 00:27:58,238
Sally.

337
00:27:58,488 --> 00:27:59,873
Sally, you come talk with me.

338
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:00,907
Come on, johnse.

339
00:28:01,157 --> 00:28:02,309
Come on.

340
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,393
Come on now.

341
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:09,765
Hard to reconcile you
in the lord's house.

342
00:28:11,301 --> 00:28:15,855
Yeah, well, levicy dragged me
here to-

343
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:18,658
It's good to see you, randall.

344
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:23,263
I feared- I feared you dead.

345
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:27,667
Times I felt like I was.

346
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:33,377
Rest of the company-all lost,
all dead, except me.

347
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:35,875
Our men are home now, sally.

348
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,644
Yours is.

349
00:28:37,894 --> 00:28:42,782
Mine is only half home.

350
00:28:43,032 --> 00:28:44,518
I mean to enter
the election day contest,

351
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:48,721
and I would value your opinion.

352
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:50,590
Go ahead.

353
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,292
Elderberry?

354
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:53,814
There's nothing sweeter.

355
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:55,828
It's terrible bad
what happened to you-

356
00:28:56,078 --> 00:28:59,832
Prison and all.

357
00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:01,701
If there's anything I can do
to help out.

358
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:07,507
You propose now to ease
your conscience for deserting?

359
00:29:07,757 --> 00:29:10,910
Or for my brother's murder?

360
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,946
Your uncle Jim done it.

361
00:29:13,196 --> 00:29:17,451
If'n he was here,
i'd say it to his face.

362
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:20,132
Jim swears he had nothing
to do with harmon's death.

363
00:29:20,382 --> 00:29:22,103
And you believe that?

364
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:29,563
Well, I have no knowledge
to the contrary, randall.

365
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:34,901
And uncle jim, he-
He swore before god.

366
00:29:35,151 --> 00:29:39,401
And what use do
Hatfields have of god?

367
00:29:42,487 --> 00:29:44,344
Well, you keep that, and you try it.

368
00:29:44,594 --> 00:29:45,612
Let me know if'n it set up and-

369
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:47,095
Thank you.

370
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:51,199
I don't understa...

371
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:13,002
Mornin'.

372
00:30:13,252 --> 00:30:15,020
There's something I'd like
to show you, Mr. Cline.

373
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,806
Court's about to convene.

374
00:30:17,056 --> 00:30:20,242
Yeah, well, I think
you'll wait for this.

375
00:30:20,492 --> 00:30:25,063
Ellison, 'lias, show lawyer
cline our evidence.

376
00:30:30,118 --> 00:30:34,123
You recall that hamish was
witness on your bill of sale

377
00:30:34,373 --> 00:30:38,995
in '59 but somehow died,

378
00:30:39,503 --> 00:30:41,197
got himself buried in '57.

379
00:30:41,797 --> 00:30:45,050
You recall that?

380
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:49,972
I am somehow made a victim
of a fraud.

381
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:51,774
How is not clear to me-

382
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:54,777
Maybe you oughta should just
fetch the sheriff.

383
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:56,779
Perchance he can help you
track down the scoundrel

384
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:59,273
what sold you a bill of goods.

385
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:01,918
Obviously this changes things,
mr. Hatfield.

386
00:31:02,168 --> 00:31:03,452
Yeah.

387
00:31:03,702 --> 00:31:05,354
I forgo.

388
00:31:05,604 --> 00:31:08,858
I abandon and renounce claim to
the timber rights on your land,

389
00:31:09,108 --> 00:31:11,327
and I apologize for being hasty

390
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:15,080
and putting forth an invalid claim.

391
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,200
You deserve to be compensated.
You shall be.

392
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,542
I have $22 here.

393
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:22,138
Keep your money.

394
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:25,407
I take that kindly, mr. Hatfield.

395
00:31:25,657 --> 00:31:27,009
Young lawyer starting his career,

396
00:31:27,393 --> 00:31:31,981
deceived by a forged document
don't look well.

397
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:34,250
Don't look well at all.

398
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,352
People might even start to think

399
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:44,160
that you had a hand in this
forgin' and then bungled it.

400
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,530
What do you want, mr. Hatfield?

401
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,235
Well, you meant to have
all that was mine.

402
00:31:52,485 --> 00:31:55,078
So I must be entitled
to have all what's yours.

403
00:31:57,456 --> 00:32:02,779
At least what you inherited
from your daddy.

404
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:06,115
That's 5,000 acres.

405
00:32:06,365 --> 00:32:10,186
Don't hardly much want the land.

406
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:12,370
Just the timber rights.

407
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:22,331
I don't believe we have to go
in court at all, do we?

408
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:24,500
Can't find her, pa.

409
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,435
Consarn it.

410
00:32:26,685 --> 00:32:28,470
Keep looking.

411
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,439
It's one little pig.

412
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:32,875
Mountain lion probably got her.

413
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,845
That pig fattened up feeds
this family for a whole winter.

414
00:32:36,095 --> 00:32:38,129
You understand that, boy?

415
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,086
Misfortune afflicts us both.

416
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:46,755
Sorry about you losing
your land, cousin.

417
00:32:47,606 --> 00:32:51,560
Still, we cannot let our paths
be diverted

418
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,345
by the treachery of others.

419
00:32:53,595 --> 00:32:55,889
Trust in the lord and do good,

420
00:32:56,715 --> 00:32:59,518
and he shall give thee
the desires of thine heart.

421
00:32:59,768 --> 00:33:02,053
All done, poppy.
You like it?

422
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:09,178
Fine job, Roseanna.

423
00:33:09,428 --> 00:33:12,072
Here.

424
00:33:12,322 --> 00:33:13,316
I've been meaning to give you this.

425
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:14,450
A gold button?

426
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,818
It's from the war.

427
00:33:16,068 --> 00:33:17,153
For me?

428
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:21,257
'Cause you're my favorite.

429
00:33:21,507 --> 00:33:23,525
Perhaps you're right, randall.

430
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:26,395
But I would not drop my guard.

431
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:29,232
War changes men.

432
00:33:29,482 --> 00:33:30,566
Peacetime can turn them into

433
00:33:30,816 --> 00:33:33,369
scheming snakes.

434
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:35,671
I predict Hatfield will keep
coming at you

435
00:33:35,921 --> 00:33:40,609
feigning friendship and generosity.

436
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:42,912
And when he does,

437
00:33:43,436 --> 00:33:45,696
you'll know I'm right.

438
00:33:57,709 --> 00:34:03,565
I hoped I might find you here,
randall.

439
00:34:03,815 --> 00:34:06,618
Almost like old times, huh?

440
00:34:10,189 --> 00:34:13,142
What brings you to town?

441
00:34:13,392 --> 00:34:15,511
Business.

442
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:17,280
I just made a deal
with jinx clabberat

443
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:20,516
to farm out some of his good
bottomland with my boys.

444
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:24,186
We might just grow us
a big cash crop of tobaccy.

445
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:25,437
Good.

446
00:34:26,138 --> 00:34:27,456
Good.

447
00:34:27,706 --> 00:34:28,991
You come to boast about stealing

448
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:34,763
from my cousin Perry Cline?

449
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:36,432
Nobody come here to boast, randall.

450
00:34:36,682 --> 00:34:40,451
I'm just-i'm just trying to be
friendly.

451
00:34:44,723 --> 00:34:46,175
I don't know what you heard,

452
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:51,580
but nary a thing was stole
from your kin.

453
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,549
Perry Cline gave me his timber rights

454
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:58,087
when I uncovered how he was
trying to cheat me.

455
00:34:58,337 --> 00:35:00,189
I should've blown his damn head
off is what I shoulda done,

456
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:01,472
but...

457
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:07,354
You think I profited unfairly, you-

458
00:35:10,216 --> 00:35:12,068
you take this.

459
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:17,340
You take that in good conscience.

460
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,475
Does it weigh on you at all,
captain Hatfield,

461
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:21,277
how you profited while others
stayed the course

462
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:24,295
and suffered for it?

463
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:32,021
No man questions what I gave
the cause, randall.

464
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:33,630
Especially you.

465
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,093
'nother one.

466
00:36:06,905 --> 00:36:10,826
Talk is, they're gonna build
a railroad right through here.

467
00:36:11,076 --> 00:36:13,629
Then we'll send our timber
in all directions

468
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,297
'round the whole country.

469
00:36:15,547 --> 00:36:17,666
Not up north, I hope.

470
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:19,001
War's long over, jim.

471
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:20,702
There's no north, no south-

472
00:36:20,952 --> 00:36:23,839
Just people who got money
and people who ain't.

473
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:26,808
I mean to do business with them
that has.

474
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:28,444
I always knew we was gonna be rich.

475
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:31,647
Hey!

476
00:36:31,897 --> 00:36:34,083
It's your boy, william!

477
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:35,651
Tree fell!

478
00:36:36,276 --> 00:36:39,755
Splinter caught his eye!

479
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:43,374
I can't see!

480
00:36:44,576 --> 00:36:47,729
Eddie, I can't see!

481
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:49,265
Why can't I see?

482
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:52,268
I know it hurts bad, son.

483
00:36:52,518 --> 00:36:55,879
I admire how you-I admire how
you standin' up to it.

484
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,074
Give me some water.

485
00:36:58,324 --> 00:36:59,641
Johnse, why can't I see?

486
00:36:59,891 --> 00:37:01,410
We're gonna get you to
a doctor straightaway.

487
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,780
Anse.

488
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,306
You're not gonna die,

489
00:37:06,965 --> 00:37:08,817
but I won't lie to you.

490
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:10,735
This is a serious wound.

491
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,413
Howdy, neighbors.

492
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:39,248
Randall.

493
00:37:39,498 --> 00:37:40,131
Miss sally.

494
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,300
How do you do, floyd?

495
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:48,157
Blessed day, ain't it?

496
00:37:48,407 --> 00:37:49,525
Sure is.

497
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:51,660
How's your harvest this season?

498
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,862
Fair to middlin'.

499
00:37:54,112 --> 00:37:55,164
Better than the last one.

500
00:37:55,414 --> 00:37:57,615
Not as good as the next.

501
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:00,169
Your hogs fattened up nice.

502
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:01,970
Ah, ornery critters.

503
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,739
Had the kids and dogs try
to round them up,

504
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:08,377
but these two kept a'squealin' off.

505
00:38:08,627 --> 00:38:09,645
Tell me, floyd, how long have you had

506
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:11,813
that spotted shoat there?

507
00:38:12,063 --> 00:38:13,415
Well, he bred last year.

508
00:38:13,956 --> 00:38:15,484
I know when it was bred.

509
00:38:15,734 --> 00:38:18,336
That's my markin' on its ears.

510
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:21,690
Ah, no, randall, you're mistook.

511
00:38:22,215 --> 00:38:26,862
I notch my swines particular
so I do not get mistook.

512
00:38:27,112 --> 00:38:29,565
Well, you know young pigs
is wanderers.

513
00:38:29,815 --> 00:38:32,501
I expect you gots one or two of
mine hangin' in your smokehouse.

514
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:34,803
I do not.

515
00:38:35,053 --> 00:38:36,905
How many more of my pigs you took?

516
00:38:37,155 --> 00:38:39,983
How much pork you takin' from
my family to stuff your belly?

517
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:42,844
Now, hang on, randall.
That's a serious accusal.

518
00:38:43,094 --> 00:38:45,214
You's bein' quarrelsome.

519
00:38:45,464 --> 00:38:46,748
I am, am i?

520
00:38:46,998 --> 00:38:49,418
Well, how's this for quarrelsome?

521
00:38:49,668 --> 00:38:56,040
Damn you for a pig thief,
floyd Hatfield.

522
00:38:58,644 --> 00:38:59,428
Come on.

523
00:38:59,678 --> 00:39:01,530
Come on, git.

524
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,615
I guess all you Hatfields
are the same!

525
00:39:09,843 --> 00:39:11,180
Did you get enough to eat, Perry?

526
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,662
Thank you.

527
00:39:12,912 --> 00:39:13,997
An elegant sufficiency, aunt sally.

528
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:16,600
Elegant sufficiency.

529
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,603
Roseanna, help me clear the table.

530
00:39:19,853 --> 00:39:22,821
Alifair, the little one.

531
00:39:25,758 --> 00:39:27,043
This matter of floyd Hatfield

532
00:39:27,293 --> 00:39:29,746
and the theft of your livestock...

533
00:39:29,996 --> 00:39:32,660
He lied and denied it to my face.

534
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,619
We sue.

535
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:38,655
It's useful to think of the law
as a muscle.

536
00:39:38,905 --> 00:39:41,524
Like a muscle, it can be
strengthened with proper use.

537
00:39:41,774 --> 00:39:43,192
Used too little, it becomes feeble

538
00:39:43,442 --> 00:39:45,595
and too weak to protect you.

539
00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:47,258
That's fine talk, Perry.

540
00:39:47,713 --> 00:39:50,033
You got the gift.

541
00:39:50,283 --> 00:39:52,472
Floyd Hatfield is on the other
side of the river.

542
00:39:52,818 --> 00:39:55,605
Where a Hatfield sits as judge.

543
00:39:55,855 --> 00:39:58,174
Mm, I can arrange a jury trial.

544
00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:03,579
We'll sit six McCoys
and six Hatfields.

545
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:06,850
It won't get you justice
for your poor murdered brother.

546
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,739
We win this case, it's a kind of
justice nonetheless.

547
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:11,855
It strikes me as foolish.

548
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:13,923
How's that, ma'am?

549
00:40:14,173 --> 00:40:16,893
Goin' to court over a pig.

550
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:19,290
Makes us look like some
village idiot.

551
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,835
Sally...

552
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:26,002
I suppose, in the end,

553
00:40:26,252 --> 00:40:28,471
god punishes all transgression.

554
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:30,384
But, as you well know,

555
00:40:30,823 --> 00:40:32,275
oftentimes the good lord expects us

556
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:37,080
to be the instrument of his will.

557
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:40,750
What say you, jim?

558
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,867
I say we sue.

559
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:01,938
How's the eye doing?

560
00:41:02,188 --> 00:41:05,141
It's gone milky, capped over.

561
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:08,211
Uh-huh.

562
00:41:08,461 --> 00:41:10,180
- Let me see.
- No, jim.

563
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,881
- Come on, let me see.
- Jim.

564
00:41:12,131 --> 00:41:14,818
Let me see it.

565
00:41:15,068 --> 00:41:17,269
Turn around.

566
00:41:19,405 --> 00:41:21,124
What am I doin' here?

567
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:25,661
You're supporting your family.

568
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:29,665
Over a pig?

569
00:41:30,361 --> 00:41:31,968
Anse.

570
00:41:32,218 --> 00:41:33,447
Put it away.

571
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:36,305
I'm gonna call you captain.

572
00:41:36,555 --> 00:41:37,869
Cap for captain.

573
00:41:38,524 --> 00:41:40,643
Like your daddy.

574
00:41:40,893 --> 00:41:42,665
Shows you're an important feller.

575
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:44,981
Good name, cap, hmm?

576
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:46,460
Yeah, I like it.

577
00:41:58,389 --> 00:42:00,766
Hi, uncle Wall!

578
00:42:01,016 --> 00:42:03,315
Hi, uncle wall!

579
00:42:05,118 --> 00:42:08,838
Court is in session.

580
00:42:09,088 --> 00:42:10,740
Thanks to those of you on the jury

581
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,942
for coming here today
and agreeing to serve.

582
00:42:13,445 --> 00:42:15,945
I know most of y'all got crops.
Stock needs tendin'.

583
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:17,313
So I ain't gonna keep you from
your task

584
00:42:17,563 --> 00:42:21,951
any longer than necessary.

585
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:27,657
Judge Hatfield, members of the jury,

586
00:42:27,907 --> 00:42:30,342
it is useful to think of the law
as a muscle.

587
00:42:32,278 --> 00:42:34,030
Like a muscle, it can be
strengthened with proper use.

588
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,799
Mr. Cline.

589
00:42:36,049 --> 00:42:37,428
The briefer you make your remarks,

590
00:42:37,678 --> 00:42:38,888
the better your case
is gonna be received.

591
00:42:41,154 --> 00:42:42,138
Serves you, windbag.

592
00:42:42,388 --> 00:42:43,225
Sit down!

593
00:42:43,475 --> 00:42:45,909
Do you mean to call witnesses?

594
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:48,077
Mr. Randall McCoy
and his wife, sally,

595
00:42:48,327 --> 00:42:49,712
both saw the McCoy markin'

596
00:42:49,962 --> 00:42:51,734
on the ear of the hog in question.

597
00:42:52,065 --> 00:42:53,917
Oh, now, I don't think we need
to call 'em to the stand

598
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:55,151
just to say so.

599
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:56,886
So to put it plain,

600
00:42:57,656 --> 00:43:00,451
the McCoys say it is their pig
and their notch,

601
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:01,869
and floyd says that ain't so.

602
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:05,122
Is that clear?

603
00:43:05,372 --> 00:43:06,499
Sure.

604
00:43:06,749 --> 00:43:09,598
Is the pig in court today?

605
00:43:09,848 --> 00:43:10,753
No, it ain't.

606
00:43:11,003 --> 00:43:12,338
Why not?

607
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:14,337
Well, um...

608
00:43:14,587 --> 00:43:16,188
It's done been et.

609
00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:21,138
All right, floyd.

610
00:43:21,388 --> 00:43:23,279
You got any witness saw it
before you butchered the swine

611
00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:24,725
to say it is your notch?

612
00:43:24,975 --> 00:43:26,916
I didn't know I needed one.

613
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,351
If you give me a couple hours,

614
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:30,119
I might could come up with somebody.

615
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:32,274
I seen it.

616
00:43:32,524 --> 00:43:34,090
The hog in question, that is.

617
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,945
And I seen floyd actually cut
that shoat's ear.

618
00:43:36,195 --> 00:43:39,929
Oh, do I need to say I seen it
on the bible?

619
00:43:40,179 --> 00:43:43,299
I'd advise you not to.

620
00:43:43,549 --> 00:43:46,539
That pig had black spots on
its hams, as I recollect.

621
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,404
And floyd's hand slipped
when he notched it.

622
00:43:48,654 --> 00:43:51,741
Pretty near cut his thumb off.

623
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:54,244
Anyways, why would floyd show
him that swine if he stole it?

624
00:43:54,494 --> 00:43:55,745
It don't make no sense.

625
00:43:56,256 --> 00:43:57,747
That's enough, bill.

626
00:43:57,997 --> 00:43:59,682
I trust y'all give
bill staton's testimony

627
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:01,351
the respect it deserves.

628
00:44:01,601 --> 00:44:03,253
Your honor, I ain't
quite done, you see-

629
00:44:03,806 --> 00:44:04,890
You sit down!

630
00:44:11,444 --> 00:44:13,863
Me Mbers of the jury,

631
00:44:14,113 --> 00:44:18,935
who thinks the hog belonged
to floyd Hatfield?

632
00:44:19,571 --> 00:44:22,491
All right, who believes the hog
was randall McCoy's?

633
00:44:22,741 --> 00:44:26,370
- Here.
- Yes, sir.

634
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:31,208
Selkirk McCoy, you didn't vote
one way or t'other.

635
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:33,586
Well, he votes uncle randall.

636
00:44:33,836 --> 00:44:38,154
He has to be the one to say
so, parris.

637
00:44:38,404 --> 00:44:41,190
Well, I'm trying to do
the right thing here.

638
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,515
You see, I am of
the McCoy family, but-

639
00:44:46,765 --> 00:44:50,400
Well, the truth is, deep down

640
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:53,351
I do believe that pig was one
of floyd Hatfield's razorbacks.

641
00:44:55,087 --> 00:44:56,191
Judgment's goin' down in a second.

642
00:44:56,522 --> 00:44:57,941
Do not disrespect the name McCoy.

643
00:44:58,191 --> 00:44:59,475
Bill staton swears on his oath

644
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:00,988
that he seen floyd cut that notch.

645
00:45:01,238 --> 00:45:03,546
You are a lying spawn of hell

646
00:45:03,796 --> 00:45:06,535
that voted his Hatfield wife's
apron strings!

647
00:45:06,785 --> 00:45:07,828
Oh, randall, this-

648
00:45:08,568 --> 00:45:10,820
Leave her on out of this.

649
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,389
Gonna give yourself apoplexy.

650
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:14,991
All this to-do over a pig.

651
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:17,860
This is about honor,

652
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,342
about lyin' and stealin'
and murderin'.

653
00:45:21,647 --> 00:45:23,302
That is not pertinent to the case.

654
00:45:23,552 --> 00:45:25,435
It's about sin, devil anse!

655
00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:27,931
What's christian right
and damnation wrong!

656
00:45:29,808 --> 00:45:32,208
McCoy!

657
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:33,642
This case is dismissed!

658
00:45:33,892 --> 00:45:35,460
Everybody get the hell out of here!

659
00:45:45,471 --> 00:45:48,458
By god, I will gut-shoot
the next agitator

660
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:50,994
who further disrespects my courtroom,

661
00:45:51,244 --> 00:45:53,329
McCoy or Hatfield.

662
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:54,998
I reckon this is what
I shoulda expected

663
00:45:55,248 --> 00:45:56,599
from a Hatfield court.

664
00:45:56,849 --> 00:45:59,168
One more word out of you, McCoy,

665
00:45:59,418 --> 00:46:02,671
i'll hold you in contempt.

666
00:46:02,921 --> 00:46:04,807
Best watch your high-and-mighty ass,

667
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:05,941
preacher McCoy.

668
00:46:06,191 --> 00:46:08,077
Here's scripture for you:

669
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:13,435
"blood toucheth blood."

670
00:46:19,808 --> 00:46:22,697
You don't want to make
that move, Cotton.

671
00:46:23,506 --> 00:46:24,457
See, your daddy won't tell you that

672
00:46:24,707 --> 00:46:28,228
'cause he's trying to beat you.

673
00:46:28,478 --> 00:46:29,462
Thanks, uncle Wall.

674
00:46:29,712 --> 00:46:31,331
Yeah, thanks, uncle wall.

675
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:33,333
Anyway, what I'm saying is,

676
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,936
you standin' up there in the end
didn't help things, anse.

677
00:46:36,186 --> 00:46:38,087
Yeah, well, I had it under control.

678
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:41,041
The hell you did.

679
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:45,511
These picayune squabbles
got a way of turning deadly.

680
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,781
Maybe so, but I cannot have
randall McCoy

681
00:46:49,031 --> 00:46:51,766
continue to embarrass us.

682
00:46:53,503 --> 00:46:54,754
A little embarrassment's

683
00:46:55,004 --> 00:46:56,289
better'n what grows out of injustice,

684
00:46:56,539 --> 00:46:58,974
don't you think?

685
00:47:01,311 --> 00:47:03,569
You see the look on
ol' randall McCoy's face

686
00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:08,682
when I swore that pig had
black spots on his hams?

687
00:47:08,932 --> 00:47:12,035
More you drink, louder you get.

688
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:14,921
Them McCoys come after me,

689
00:47:15,171 --> 00:47:17,992
i'll cut 'em down
like Perry Cline's trees.

690
00:47:18,242 --> 00:47:22,462
Hell, I'll even nut 'em.

691
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:27,067
You wanna say that again?

692
00:47:27,317 --> 00:47:30,353
I'd just love to take away that
arkansas toothpick of your,

693
00:47:30,804 --> 00:47:33,515
shove it straight up
your stinkin' asshole.

694
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:37,458
I said any McCoys come after me
for what I said in court,

695
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:39,509
i'll take 'em down, and I'll nut 'em.

696
00:47:41,478 --> 00:47:43,901
Well, I suspect you might be
stupid enough to try.

697
00:47:45,382 --> 00:47:47,029
You-you callin' me out, hmm?

698
00:47:47,279 --> 00:47:48,869
This ain't the place.

699
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,950
But you got a mighty big mouth,
bill staton.

700
00:47:55,526 --> 00:47:59,028
Okay, nothin' to do but just
sit here-

701
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:02,115
Any McCoy come after me
and do me harm,

702
00:48:02,365 --> 00:48:05,467
i'll take you down!

703
00:48:08,605 --> 00:48:09,505
Come on!

704
00:48:11,575 --> 00:48:14,139
Eh!
What, are you scared?

705
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:19,767
That was fun, skunky, huh?

706
00:48:20,017 --> 00:48:21,902
You had fun with that?
You happy with that?

707
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:24,104
You know, you're brave.

708
00:48:24,354 --> 00:48:26,355
I ain't gonna drink with you.
I ain't gonna drink with you.

709
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:36,684
Howdy, anse.

710
00:48:36,934 --> 00:48:39,920
I guess I told 'em, huh.

711
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,324
You see a mean dog sleeping,
do you go pester him?

712
00:48:43,574 --> 00:48:45,192
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

713
00:48:45,442 --> 00:48:47,894
He awake, you go kick him?

714
00:48:48,144 --> 00:48:49,563
No, you don't.

715
00:48:49,813 --> 00:48:51,365
You leave him alone,
maybe he goes back to sleep.

716
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:54,835
You get my point?

717
00:48:55,085 --> 00:48:56,348
Yeah, but those shit-butt McCoys-

718
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,875
We understand each other?

719
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:03,960
Yes, sir.

720
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,919
<i>I don't drink, and I don't smoke</i>

721
00:49:13,169 --> 00:49:15,556
<i>but I give your girl a poke</i>

722
00:49:15,806 --> 00:49:17,257
<i>I give your girl a poke</i>

723
00:49:17,507 --> 00:49:19,226
<i>I said that I don't smoke</i>

724
00:49:19,476 --> 00:49:21,729
<i>I give your girl a poke,
I give your girl a poke</i>

725
00:49:21,979 --> 00:49:26,670
afternoon, bill.

726
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,881
You want to nut us?

727
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:33,885
I got ya both, huh?

728
00:49:34,135 --> 00:49:35,776
Here we are, bill.

729
00:49:36,026 --> 00:49:37,639
You still want to take us down,

730
00:49:37,889 --> 00:49:39,850
cut off our balls?

731
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,978
Go ahead.

732
00:49:51,642 --> 00:49:53,342
Should we nut him?

733
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:19,264
Come on, come on.

734
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,821
Shit.

735
00:50:54,071 --> 00:50:55,004
Come on.

736
00:50:56,807 --> 00:50:58,892
It's devil anse.

737
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:00,226
Alone?

738
00:51:00,476 --> 00:51:01,556
Well, ain't he enough?

739
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:25,205
Sons a bitches!

740
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:29,918
Don't you slay us.

741
00:51:44,254 --> 00:51:45,105
Cap...

742
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:46,606
Yeah, pa.

743
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:48,341
Pick up them guns.

744
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:50,726
Let's get these wastrels
back across the river.

745
00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:09,162
It's a nice day for a hangin',

746
00:52:09,412 --> 00:52:10,596
ain't it, ol' randall?

747
00:52:10,846 --> 00:52:14,600
Mean Jim Vance.

748
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:17,003
Well, you're not all that much.

749
00:52:17,253 --> 00:52:20,240
I mean, up close-like.

750
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:21,541
Who the hell are you?

751
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:25,594
Oh, I'm tolbert McCoy,
son of randall.

752
00:52:27,597 --> 00:52:29,649
See, I always wanted to meet
the man that murdered my uncle

753
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:32,519
and tell him his days are comin'.

754
00:52:32,769 --> 00:52:34,521
Not from the likes of you,

755
00:52:34,771 --> 00:52:38,153
you wet-eared prick-chafing
little shit.

756
00:52:38,403 --> 00:52:41,594
Get out of my sight before
I snap you like a chicken neck!

757
00:52:41,844 --> 00:52:44,576
Tolbert.

758
00:52:44,826 --> 00:52:46,515
We're here on other business.

759
00:53:00,496 --> 00:53:02,969
Move!

760
00:53:03,219 --> 00:53:05,051
What are my two nephews
doing in there

761
00:53:05,301 --> 00:53:07,987
being locked up next to
this godforsaken corpse?

762
00:53:08,237 --> 00:53:09,622
You live with what you done,

763
00:53:09,872 --> 00:53:11,291
you might think twice before
doin' it again

764
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:13,159
if you should so get the chance.

765
00:53:13,409 --> 00:53:15,228
Judge, I respectfully request
that bail be set

766
00:53:15,478 --> 00:53:16,399
at a reasonable amount.

767
00:53:16,846 --> 00:53:18,598
Denied.

768
00:53:18,848 --> 00:53:20,733
These boys stand accused
of a capital crime.

769
00:53:20,983 --> 00:53:23,035
And I will not have this
business dragged out to fester.

770
00:53:23,285 --> 00:53:24,670
You want to tell me why

771
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,539
I shouldn't hang 'em both for murder?

772
00:53:27,076 --> 00:53:28,953
Bein' a Hatfield,
you're hardly impartial.

773
00:53:29,325 --> 00:53:31,144
I'm the attorney of record here,

774
00:53:31,394 --> 00:53:33,679
and I'll answer the questions.

775
00:53:33,929 --> 00:53:35,748
Bill staton threatened to kill

776
00:53:35,998 --> 00:53:37,584
any McCoys that crossed his path.

777
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:39,255
Now, we got witnesses to that.

778
00:53:39,505 --> 00:53:40,987
Parris and sam did cross his path,

779
00:53:41,237 --> 00:53:42,755
and staton did try to kill them,

780
00:53:43,005 --> 00:53:47,096
then was killed himself by
parris and sam in self-defense,

781
00:53:47,346 --> 00:53:49,362
which these law-abiding
young men deeply regret.

782
00:53:49,612 --> 00:53:51,142
Amen.
We surely do.

783
00:53:51,447 --> 00:53:53,353
We's real sorry we had to do it,

784
00:53:53,603 --> 00:53:55,201
defending ourselves like that,

785
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:59,005
but bill staton give us no choice.

786
00:53:59,255 --> 00:54:00,540
In any event, judge,

787
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:05,145
you got no authority to try
a capital case.

788
00:54:05,865 --> 00:54:07,617
Noted.

789
00:54:07,867 --> 00:54:14,120
Anse, you got anything to say
'fore I pronounce sentence?

790
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,688
Bill staton was a tolerable worker,

791
00:54:15,938 --> 00:54:19,212
always gave money to
and got wood in for his mother

792
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:23,630
till she died last winter.

793
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,832
He did drink a bit.

794
00:54:27,082 --> 00:54:30,236
Parris and sam both knew that
bill's threats-they both knew-

795
00:54:30,486 --> 00:54:33,559
That they was empty as the
bottles they was comin' from.

796
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:36,229
They wanted to revenge his
mouthin' off, plain and simple.

797
00:54:36,479 --> 00:54:40,346
Then they lay in wait to get it.

798
00:54:40,596 --> 00:54:42,248
That's premeditated homicide,

799
00:54:42,498 --> 00:54:46,286
for which accordin' to the law
and your almighty god,

800
00:54:46,536 --> 00:54:47,554
they had oughta hang.

801
00:54:47,804 --> 00:54:49,889
You're talkin' like a fool.

802
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:52,091
This lowlife drunkard lyin' dead here

803
00:54:52,341 --> 00:54:54,455
threatened murder on my family!

804
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:56,796
God damn it!

805
00:54:57,046 --> 00:54:59,581
Y'all just get over here
and sit down and shut up.

806
00:55:04,887 --> 00:55:07,927
All of us know parris and sam
killed bill staton.

807
00:55:08,177 --> 00:55:13,428
Only the circumstances
remain in question.

808
00:55:15,565 --> 00:55:17,783
It's a damn shame

809
00:55:18,033 --> 00:55:20,320
no one told 'em shootin' a drunk
on the road

810
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:23,067
was wrong and not worth hangin' for

811
00:55:23,439 --> 00:55:26,240
or even the price
of the goddamn lead.

812
00:55:29,445 --> 00:55:31,897
And it's also a damn shame

813
00:55:32,147 --> 00:55:33,766
that no one stopped his hired hand's

814
00:55:34,016 --> 00:55:35,602
liquored-up threats and curses

815
00:55:35,852 --> 00:55:37,303
from inflaming two fools
to commit murder,

816
00:55:37,553 --> 00:55:39,542
which was damn easy to foresee.

817
00:55:54,971 --> 00:55:58,591
I find you both guilty
of this heinous crime,

818
00:55:58,841 --> 00:56:00,229
for which you are to be taken

819
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:02,295
to some convenient spot without delay

820
00:56:02,545 --> 00:56:07,570
and thereby hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

821
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:20,246
A sentence which I hereby suspend

822
00:56:20,496 --> 00:56:23,798
since no one can say whether
it was self-defense or not.

823
00:56:27,423 --> 00:56:29,800
Go on, boys.
Get the hell out of here.

824
00:56:38,781 --> 00:56:40,800
Thank you, sir.

825
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:41,771
Right there!

826
00:56:42,151 --> 00:56:45,672
Calvin, not guilty!

827
00:56:45,922 --> 00:56:48,152
I knew your daddy
would get us out of there.

828
00:56:48,402 --> 00:56:51,744
As god as my witness,

829
00:56:51,994 --> 00:56:54,747
I will not allow my court

830
00:56:54,997 --> 00:56:58,579
to be the cause of a war
between our two families.

831
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:01,587
Bill staton ain't worth it and
his ma, who he did do right by,

832
00:57:01,837 --> 00:57:02,667
is dead and gone.

833
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:04,544
God rest her soul.

834
00:57:06,976 --> 00:57:09,161
Write it in the book:

835
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:12,009
"miscreants discharged

836
00:57:12,259 --> 00:57:13,199
by judge Wall Hatfield."

837
00:57:13,449 --> 00:57:14,967
Thank you, judge.

838
00:57:15,217 --> 00:57:17,437
You've been a fair and wise man
today.

839
00:57:17,687 --> 00:57:18,766
Indeed.

840
00:57:19,288 --> 00:57:22,375
God is just and shall return to us

841
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:25,940
the years that the locusts
hath eaten.

842
00:57:28,631 --> 00:57:30,383
Well, you're just a
huckleberry above a persimmon,

843
00:57:30,633 --> 00:57:34,454
ain't ya?

844
00:57:34,704 --> 00:57:37,056
If you two don't mend
what's wrong between you,

845
00:57:37,306 --> 00:57:39,325
hellfire's gonna certainly
rise up and consume

846
00:57:39,575 --> 00:57:41,676
both our families.

847
00:57:48,651 --> 00:57:49,969
Thank you, Mr. Cline, sir.

848
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:51,637
- That's right.
- That's mighty fine work.

849
00:57:51,887 --> 00:57:53,439
We got him, pa!

850
00:57:53,689 --> 00:57:55,469
It is a good day for it.

851
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:57,209
- Get up in the wagon here, boys.
- Whoo!

852
00:57:57,459 --> 00:57:58,681
What the hell you laughing at?

853
00:57:58,931 --> 00:58:01,447
Look who it is, huh?
Believe it!

854
00:58:01,697 --> 00:58:03,602
You better believe it!

855
00:58:08,904 --> 00:58:10,484
Boom.

856
00:58:27,552 --> 00:58:29,705
Whoa, easy now, son.

857
00:58:29,955 --> 00:58:31,340
Don't want it going off just yet.

858
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:32,374
Yeah, mush-head.

859
00:58:32,624 --> 00:58:33,742
Don't blow us all up,

860
00:58:33,992 --> 00:58:36,135
you half-wit bastard moron.

861
00:58:39,497 --> 00:58:42,551
Come here.
Come here!

862
00:58:42,801 --> 00:58:45,754
Find it funny?
Come here.

863
00:58:46,004 --> 00:58:49,257
Apologize.

864
00:58:49,507 --> 00:58:52,361
Yeah, I'm sorry
you's a bastard, cotton.

865
00:58:52,611 --> 00:58:53,495
Tell him!

866
00:58:53,745 --> 00:58:55,831
All right.
All right.

867
00:58:56,081 --> 00:58:57,466
I'm sorry.

868
00:58:57,716 --> 00:59:00,469
That ain't good enough.

869
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:02,203
I apologize for what I called you

870
00:59:02,453 --> 00:59:04,816
and won't never call you
no names again.

871
00:59:07,959 --> 00:59:10,211
Didn't have to do that, pa.

872
00:59:10,461 --> 00:59:13,648
Everybody calls me mush-head.

873
00:59:13,898 --> 00:59:18,387
Well, you ain't like
everybody else, cotton.

874
00:59:18,637 --> 00:59:20,455
God gave you such a big heart,

875
00:59:20,705 --> 00:59:22,723
he couldn't very well give you
a whole abundance of brains,

876
00:59:22,973 --> 00:59:24,198
now, too, could he?

877
00:59:24,448 --> 00:59:26,534
I guess not.

878
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:29,704
I am a bastard, though.

879
00:59:29,954 --> 00:59:32,707
You listen to me, boy.
Hmm?

880
00:59:32,957 --> 00:59:34,542
A bastard's got no family
that loves him.

881
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:35,861
Is that you?

882
00:59:36,694 --> 00:59:38,447
Is that you?

883
00:59:38,697 --> 00:59:39,514
No, it's not.

884
00:59:39,764 --> 00:59:41,616
You're my son.

885
00:59:41,866 --> 00:59:44,703
Why do you think your
first name's ellison?

886
00:59:44,953 --> 00:59:47,164
Now, let's see it fly.

887
00:59:48,873 --> 00:59:51,325
Get everybody back now.

888
00:59:51,575 --> 00:59:52,460
Okeydokey!

889
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:54,544
Everybody stand back now!

890
01:00:02,095 --> 01:00:03,805
Nuh-uh.
I said no.

891
01:00:04,055 --> 01:00:05,306
I gotta make a livin' here,
god dang it.

892
01:00:05,556 --> 01:00:06,841
You want free whiskey,

893
01:00:07,091 --> 01:00:09,143
you go talk to tolbert McCoy
over there.

894
01:00:09,393 --> 01:00:10,688
I might do that.

895
01:00:15,526 --> 01:00:16,584
Don't look now.

896
01:00:16,834 --> 01:00:19,554
Johnse Hatfield is staring at us.

897
01:00:19,804 --> 01:00:23,625
I sure hope crows swoop down
and pluck his eyes out.

898
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:25,560
What a thing to say, nancy.

899
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:29,597
His uncle Jim Vance killed my pap.

900
01:00:29,847 --> 01:00:30,765
You don't know that for sure.

901
01:00:31,015 --> 01:00:32,266
Everybody says so.

902
01:00:32,516 --> 01:00:34,869
Don't make it for sure.

903
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:36,538
He sure is handsome.

904
01:00:36,788 --> 01:00:39,574
Son o' devil anse.

905
01:00:39,824 --> 01:00:42,893
I ain't never seen no devil
look like that.

906
01:00:45,138 --> 01:00:46,414
- Hey, cap.
- Yeah?

907
01:00:46,664 --> 01:00:49,216
Robert e., you all take over.

908
01:00:49,466 --> 01:00:51,553
My favorite nephew.

909
01:00:51,803 --> 01:00:53,636
Now that's just wasteful.

910
01:00:55,707 --> 01:00:57,625
Hello, Roseanna McCoy.

911
01:00:57,875 --> 01:00:59,594
I'm johnse Hatfield.

912
01:00:59,844 --> 01:01:01,405
I know who you are.

913
01:01:02,146 --> 01:01:04,432
Does that mean you won't talk to me?

914
01:01:04,682 --> 01:01:07,535
Me bein' a Hatfield and all.

915
01:01:07,785 --> 01:01:09,036
I don't mean you no harm.

916
01:01:09,286 --> 01:01:11,405
Well, now, that's the way I feel.

917
01:01:12,082 --> 01:01:15,510
You know, I don't see why
there's been so much trouble.

918
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,879
I bet you didn't know I was
named for a McCoy.

919
01:01:18,129 --> 01:01:21,683
Yes, ma'am.

920
01:01:21,933 --> 01:01:23,751
Hey, you want to go see
the second most beautiful sight

921
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:25,920
in west virginia?

922
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:27,622
So then am I supposed to ask

923
01:01:27,872 --> 01:01:29,256
what's the first
most beautiful sight?

924
01:01:29,506 --> 01:01:30,825
Well, if you wanna go.

925
01:01:31,075 --> 01:01:32,686
Then you're just gonna say,
"oh, you are."

926
01:01:33,144 --> 01:01:34,428
Just like you told eloise jenkins

927
01:01:34,678 --> 01:01:37,331
and about a dozen other girls.

928
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:38,733
I've heard all about you.

929
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:40,502
Well, if all the gossip about
me was true,

930
01:01:40,752 --> 01:01:43,113
hell, I'd have horns
and a spiny tail.

931
01:01:49,627 --> 01:01:50,745
Those are some mighty
interesting boots

932
01:01:51,538 --> 01:01:52,456
you're wearing.

933
01:01:52,797 --> 01:01:56,293
- You like 'em?
- No, I didn't say that.

934
01:01:57,001 --> 01:01:58,253
So...

935
01:01:59,103 --> 01:02:00,655
What is the second
most beautiful sight

936
01:02:00,905 --> 01:02:03,791
in west virginia?

937
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:05,928
Well, now, i'll take you there.

938
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,427
- Do you solemnly swear?
- Yeah.

939
01:02:32,103 --> 01:02:33,937
Thank you, Mr. Hatfield.

940
01:02:36,974 --> 01:02:38,826
This really is a boon
to busy housewives.

941
01:02:39,076 --> 01:02:41,563
You'll wonder how you got by
without one of these.

942
01:02:41,813 --> 01:02:42,931
You'll never fear
a scalding explosion

943
01:02:43,181 --> 01:02:44,465
with our patent release valve

944
01:02:44,715 --> 01:02:47,068
and the variometric pressure gauge.

945
01:02:47,318 --> 01:02:50,438
Oh, randall, isn't it just fine?

946
01:02:50,688 --> 01:02:53,559
Thanks for the demonstration.

947
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:54,909
Steam digester.

948
01:02:55,159 --> 01:02:56,343
Time-saving application...

949
01:02:56,593 --> 01:02:59,080
It's a silly trinket.

950
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:01,182
I've been puttin' food on
the table all these years

951
01:03:01,432 --> 01:03:04,385
without I had me some
pressurized double boiler.

952
01:03:04,635 --> 01:03:07,956
Hatfield can offer his wife
any new contraption she wants.

953
01:03:08,206 --> 01:03:09,591
One day I'm gonna buy you
some miracle,

954
01:03:09,841 --> 01:03:12,060
like that edison feller's
electric fire.

955
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:14,395
Poppy, I don't need anything
like that.

956
01:03:14,645 --> 01:03:15,730
Yes, ma'am.

957
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,498
Someday, sally, i'm gonna buy you

958
01:03:17,748 --> 01:03:19,835
a double boiler that runs on
electrical-tricity.

959
01:03:22,386 --> 01:03:23,714
How much you want for the fiddle?

960
01:03:23,964 --> 01:03:24,839
It's mine.

961
01:03:25,089 --> 01:03:26,975
I want a greenback and a half for it.

962
01:03:27,225 --> 01:03:28,719
I'll give you four bits.

963
01:03:30,794 --> 01:03:32,379
It were my grandpappy's.

964
01:03:32,629 --> 01:03:33,915
75 cents.

965
01:03:34,165 --> 01:03:39,169
I'll owe you a quarter
and you fill my cup.

966
01:03:42,139 --> 01:03:45,392
Oh, yeah, this here's my drip still.

967
01:03:45,642 --> 01:03:47,929
Ain't she a beauty?

968
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:49,864
I could produce maybe-

969
01:03:50,114 --> 01:03:51,074
I don't know- A half gallon a day

970
01:03:51,382 --> 01:03:54,468
of fine western virginia corn liquor.

971
01:03:54,718 --> 01:03:57,497
I mean, this is
the horse's head still,

972
01:03:57,747 --> 01:04:01,142
a cash can, you know.

973
01:04:01,392 --> 01:04:03,210
I built this rig myself.

974
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:06,948
I mean, I borrowed the money
to buy the parts from my pa.

975
01:04:07,198 --> 01:04:10,451
I figure, make a good livin',

976
01:04:10,701 --> 01:04:13,655
support my family proper.

977
01:04:13,905 --> 01:04:16,357
I may even build me a cabin
not far from here

978
01:04:16,607 --> 01:04:22,063
for my wife to have babies in.

979
01:04:22,313 --> 01:04:23,774
You got yourself a wife?

980
01:04:24,148 --> 01:04:28,703
Come on.
You're teasing me, I know.

981
01:04:28,953 --> 01:04:31,039
Well, one thing I know for a fact:

982
01:04:31,289 --> 01:04:33,908
you got girlfriends by the bushel.

983
01:04:34,158 --> 01:04:38,914
I ain't serious about none of 'em.

984
01:04:46,404 --> 01:04:48,056
Look at that mush-head.

985
01:04:48,306 --> 01:04:49,957
You're s'posed to drown
the runt of the litter.

986
01:04:50,207 --> 01:04:52,742
Like this...

987
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:56,564
Here.
Come on.

988
01:04:56,814 --> 01:04:58,465
Easy to laugh in a bunch, ain't it?

989
01:04:59,309 --> 01:05:01,502
Come on.

990
01:05:01,752 --> 01:05:02,904
Where's your sister?

991
01:05:03,154 --> 01:05:04,839
Oh, I don't know where she went.

992
01:05:05,089 --> 01:05:05,840
Well, go find her.

993
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:08,042
We're leavin'.

994
01:05:08,292 --> 01:05:11,512
Let her stay, randall.

995
01:05:11,762 --> 01:05:14,949
The boys will bring her home.

996
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:16,918
Tolbert!

997
01:05:17,168 --> 01:05:19,520
You're to bring Roseanna home
without fail, ya hear me?

998
01:05:20,163 --> 01:05:22,123
Yes, sir.

999
01:05:22,373 --> 01:05:24,274
Ha!

1000
01:05:26,544 --> 01:05:32,182
How many times you been kissed?

1001
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:36,471
Not countin' grandmas and such?

1002
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:39,140
Not countin'.

1003
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:41,909
A couple times, maybe.

1004
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:46,982
I bet you ain't never really
truly been kissed right.

1005
01:05:51,402 --> 01:05:56,023
Not to boast, but...

1006
01:05:56,273 --> 01:06:00,954
I believe I have a strong
reputation as a good kisser.

1007
01:06:25,169 --> 01:06:29,590
There.

1008
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,559
Now you can't say you've never
been kissed.

1009
01:06:32,809 --> 01:06:34,896
Good lord, it's gettin' dark.

1010
01:06:35,146 --> 01:06:37,165
We ought to get goin'.

1011
01:06:37,415 --> 01:06:39,566
Roseanna! Roseanna!

1012
01:06:39,816 --> 01:06:41,135
Roseanna!

1013
01:06:41,385 --> 01:06:42,970
Roseanna, we are leaving!

1014
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,839
She ain't here.

1015
01:06:45,089 --> 01:06:46,808
Must have rode back with
the mcclintocks or Mr. Cline.

1016
01:06:47,058 --> 01:06:48,342
Well, she could have told us.

1017
01:06:48,592 --> 01:06:50,778
Pa's gonna take our damn heads off.

1018
01:06:51,028 --> 01:06:52,180
Roseanna!

1019
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:54,048
Roseanna, last chance!

1020
01:06:54,298 --> 01:06:57,118
Roseanna!

1021
01:06:57,368 --> 01:06:59,202
Last chance, Roseanna!

1022
01:07:07,178 --> 01:07:09,596
Oh, please let them be here.
Please.

1023
01:07:10,231 --> 01:07:11,632
Oh, no.

1024
01:07:11,882 --> 01:07:13,400
Oh, no!

1025
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:18,139
Upon my honor, they's all
gone, even your kinsfolk.

1026
01:07:18,389 --> 01:07:19,974
Oh, god.

1027
01:07:20,658 --> 01:07:24,712
My poppy is gonna kill me.

1028
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:29,250
How am I gonna get home?

1029
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:34,055
Well, I'll take you with me.

1030
01:07:34,305 --> 01:07:35,689
My name is McCoy.

1031
01:07:35,939 --> 01:07:39,393
Your father would hardly welcome
one of us.

1032
01:07:39,643 --> 01:07:41,695
You put everything you heard
about devil anse Hatfield

1033
01:07:41,945 --> 01:07:43,898
out of your pretty head.

1034
01:07:44,148 --> 01:07:46,476
He ain't nothing like that.

1035
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,369
One thing I said to do without fail

1036
01:07:48,619 --> 01:07:49,904
was bring your sister home!

1037
01:07:50,154 --> 01:07:51,172
We figured she got a ride home.

1038
01:07:51,422 --> 01:07:52,373
How was we to know?

1039
01:07:52,623 --> 01:07:53,875
We tried!
We called out!

1040
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:55,276
She didn't answer!

1041
01:07:55,526 --> 01:07:57,611
I said without fail!

1042
01:07:57,861 --> 01:07:59,313
Go find her.

1043
01:07:59,563 --> 01:08:02,409
And don't come back till you do.

1044
01:08:02,659 --> 01:08:04,252
Only a goddamn idiot

1045
01:08:04,502 --> 01:08:07,330
would bring randall McCoy's
daughter back here,

1046
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,023
and after midnight.

1047
01:08:09,273 --> 01:08:10,157
Well, she couldn't very well
walk back home

1048
01:08:10,407 --> 01:08:12,085
in the dark by herself.

1049
01:08:12,443 --> 01:08:15,729
You don't want her here,
that's fine, but...

1050
01:08:15,979 --> 01:08:19,433
Don't strike me as overgenerous.

1051
01:08:19,683 --> 01:08:21,802
Shit, I'll hitch a wagon,
ride her back home.

1052
01:08:22,052 --> 01:08:25,139
You ain't ridin' her nowheres.

1053
01:08:25,389 --> 01:08:26,974
The way you make
this predicament worse

1054
01:08:27,224 --> 01:08:29,843
is for randall McCoy to see you
with his daughter afore sunrise.

1055
01:08:30,093 --> 01:08:31,946
He'll shoot your damn head off,
and I wouldn't blame him.

1056
01:08:32,196 --> 01:08:34,023
What do you want me to do?

1057
01:08:34,273 --> 01:08:36,417
I want you to stay away off
o' her, that's what.

1058
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:40,754
Levicy, have the girls make down
a pallet

1059
01:08:41,004 --> 01:08:44,292
on the floor for our guest.

1060
01:08:44,542 --> 01:08:47,161
Come mornin', you take her
to the edge of the tug

1061
01:08:47,411 --> 01:08:48,996
and then leave her off.

1062
01:08:49,246 --> 01:08:50,456
Yes, sir.

1063
01:08:50,706 --> 01:08:54,101
And then get rid of them
fancy-nancy boots.

1064
01:08:54,351 --> 01:08:56,419
You're supposed to be a workin' man.

1065
01:09:13,704 --> 01:09:17,458
Good-lookin' girl.

1066
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:20,510
Yeah, well, it don't make it
worth the goddamn trouble.

1067
01:09:24,448 --> 01:09:27,201
The look on McCoy's face
when he finds out,

1068
01:09:27,451 --> 01:09:29,819
that'll be worth seeing.

1069
01:09:32,656 --> 01:09:35,124
You just keep practicin'.

1070
01:09:36,527 --> 01:09:38,628
Maybe a different tune.

1071
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:04,287
Shh.
Go back to sleep.

1072
01:10:10,827 --> 01:10:12,595
Hi.
Shh.

1073
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:43,326
Oh, and on our honeymoon,

1074
01:10:44,434 --> 01:10:46,153
we're gonna take a real train ride

1075
01:10:46,403 --> 01:10:50,368
all the way across the country
till we can't go no more.

1076
01:10:50,618 --> 01:10:52,893
I read where they got this great
blue ocean up in oregon.

1077
01:10:53,143 --> 01:10:55,665
I mean, this thing's so big and wide,

1078
01:10:55,915 --> 01:10:57,057
you can't even see the other side.

1079
01:11:00,661 --> 01:11:02,881
You cryin'?

1080
01:11:03,131 --> 01:11:06,092
What on earth for?

1081
01:11:06,342 --> 01:11:09,536
Just wonderin' where I fit in
on this long list of conquests.

1082
01:11:13,241 --> 01:11:15,351
My beautiful, sweet darlin'.

1083
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:17,728
You think I'm toyin' with you?

1084
01:11:17,978 --> 01:11:21,066
I don't know what to think.

1085
01:11:21,316 --> 01:11:23,025
This is my first time.

1086
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:26,838
I was savin' myself for a husband,

1087
01:11:27,088 --> 01:11:28,906
just like god told me to.

1088
01:11:29,156 --> 01:11:31,509
I ain't foolin' here, Roseanna.

1089
01:11:31,759 --> 01:11:33,536
I intend to marry you.

1090
01:11:34,229 --> 01:11:36,914
If I hadn't promised my pa,

1091
01:11:37,164 --> 01:11:39,017
hell, I'd ride on across
that river right now,

1092
01:11:39,267 --> 01:11:42,837
and on bended knee,
i'd ask your daddy myself.

1093
01:11:43,138 --> 01:11:46,758
Come here.

1094
01:11:47,008 --> 01:11:52,180
I'd go up against the whole
world to make you my wife.

1095
01:11:52,747 --> 01:11:55,000
And I can't change my past
or our kin,

1096
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:58,736
but I tell you true,

1097
01:11:58,986 --> 01:12:01,397
I ain't never felt like this before

1098
01:12:02,089 --> 01:12:06,569
about nobody else but you.

1099
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:16,370
There she is.

1100
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:18,390
That's johnse Hatfield
a'kissin' on her.

1101
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,666
That son of a bitch!

1102
01:12:21,176 --> 01:12:22,627
Now get over there.

1103
01:12:22,877 --> 01:12:24,045
You tell him.

1104
01:12:24,295 --> 01:12:25,945
Okay.

1105
01:12:31,786 --> 01:12:33,220
- Bye.
- Bye.

1106
01:12:39,894 --> 01:12:41,395
I don't wanna cross that bridge.

1107
01:12:41,645 --> 01:12:43,272
I'll be here when you get back.

1108
01:12:46,267 --> 01:12:47,526
Y'ain't gettin' away, johnse!

1109
01:12:47,776 --> 01:12:48,802
Oh, my god!
Johnse!

1110
01:12:49,945 --> 01:12:51,022
Johnse, it's my brothers!

1111
01:12:51,272 --> 01:12:52,523
Go!
Go on!

1112
01:12:52,773 --> 01:12:53,992
I love you, Roseanna!

1113
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:54,951
Ha!

1114
01:12:55,577 --> 01:12:57,895
Wait! Wait!
Stop!

1115
01:12:58,145 --> 01:13:00,231
Stop!
Don't hurt him!

1116
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:02,625
He didn't do nothing!

1117
01:13:03,251 --> 01:13:04,669
Buddy, buddy, you gotta stop 'em!

1118
01:13:04,919 --> 01:13:06,386
We gotta get you to poppy.

1119
01:13:19,016 --> 01:13:20,251
I didn't do nothing!

1120
01:13:20,809 --> 01:13:24,021
Get him!

1121
01:13:24,271 --> 01:13:26,072
You're a dead man!

1122
01:13:32,413 --> 01:13:34,165
God damn it, tolbert!

1123
01:13:34,415 --> 01:13:36,242
What you so hot about, anyway?

1124
01:13:36,492 --> 01:13:38,619
You're the one that left
Roseanna with no way home.

1125
01:13:39,287 --> 01:13:42,373
All I did was give her shelter,
feed her dinner,

1126
01:13:42,757 --> 01:13:44,041
and keep her safe from harm!

1127
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:45,710
You try to have your way with her?

1128
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,279
No, sir!

1129
01:13:48,529 --> 01:13:50,982
She spent the night with my sisters.

1130
01:13:51,232 --> 01:13:55,086
You saw her-safe and sound.

1131
01:13:55,336 --> 01:13:57,122
You think she'd be kissin' on me

1132
01:13:57,372 --> 01:13:59,090
if I had violated her in any way?

1133
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,015
I did hear Roseanna say...

1134
01:14:00,408 --> 01:14:02,093
Shut up, calvin.

1135
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:04,162
Now, I say we kill him now and
t geon back across the river

1136
01:14:04,687 --> 01:14:05,938
before anyone knows.

1137
01:14:06,188 --> 01:14:07,932
Hell, your sister'll know.

1138
01:14:08,182 --> 01:14:09,067
She loves me.

1139
01:14:09,317 --> 01:14:10,817
That's a load of bull manure!

1140
01:14:11,068 --> 01:14:12,037
No, it ain't.

1141
01:14:12,287 --> 01:14:15,706
And I love her too, god damn it.

1142
01:14:15,956 --> 01:14:20,161
Since I got to prove it to you.

1143
01:14:20,411 --> 01:14:22,413
Well, how bad you shot, johnse?

1144
01:14:22,663 --> 01:14:25,616
Ha...
Well...

1145
01:14:25,866 --> 01:14:26,751
I'll live.

1146
01:14:27,502 --> 01:14:30,655
Think the bullet tore
straight through me.

1147
01:14:30,905 --> 01:14:33,024
Tolbert, let's go.

1148
01:14:33,274 --> 01:14:35,126
Come on.

1149
01:14:35,634 --> 01:14:37,695
You tell your pa

1150
01:14:37,945 --> 01:14:40,280
I want to ask Roseanna's hand
in marriage!

1151
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:48,139
Hey, pa!
We found her!

1152
01:14:48,389 --> 01:14:49,707
We found her!

1153
01:14:49,957 --> 01:14:51,825
I got Roseanna!

1154
01:15:01,436 --> 01:15:03,662
You spent the night
under a Hatfield roof?

1155
01:15:03,912 --> 01:15:07,158
With johnse's sisters, sir.

1156
01:15:07,408 --> 01:15:09,008
Mr. Hatfield kindly gave permission.

1157
01:15:13,338 --> 01:15:18,017
Johnse, he, uh- He wants to marry me.

1158
01:15:20,221 --> 01:15:22,307
Beg your damn pardon?

1159
01:15:22,557 --> 01:15:25,009
He loves me, poppy.

1160
01:15:25,259 --> 01:15:27,311
He wants to ask you proper, you know.

1161
01:15:27,561 --> 01:15:29,772
He wants to make sure it's right.

1162
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,401
He touch you, Roseanna?

1163
01:15:35,169 --> 01:15:36,970
No.

1164
01:15:45,079 --> 01:15:46,897
You go on.

1165
01:15:47,147 --> 01:15:49,300
Do whatever you want.

1166
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:50,935
You like the Hatfields so much,

1167
01:15:51,185 --> 01:15:53,119
why don't you go stay with them
forever?

1168
01:15:57,224 --> 01:15:59,134
You're not my daughter anymore.

1169
01:16:33,126 --> 01:16:34,712
You'll have to have rutherford
take a look at this.

1170
01:16:34,962 --> 01:16:35,846
No, it's fine.

1171
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:36,847
Ow!

1172
01:16:37,097 --> 01:16:38,716
Keep your hand out of the way.

1173
01:16:38,966 --> 01:16:40,185
He's gonna do the same thing
you're doing.

1174
01:16:40,435 --> 01:16:43,621
Daddy, her father don't object.

1175
01:16:43,871 --> 01:16:45,431
Well, looks like somebody did.

1176
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:47,024
Yeah, her boneheaded brothers-ow!

1177
01:16:47,557 --> 01:16:49,268
Would you hold still?

1178
01:16:49,518 --> 01:16:50,761
I want to hear again
that randall McCoy

1179
01:16:51,011 --> 01:16:54,199
agreed to you marrying his daughter.

1180
01:16:54,449 --> 01:16:56,967
No, not exactly.

1181
01:16:57,217 --> 01:16:59,437
He said he don't care.

1182
01:16:59,687 --> 01:17:00,779
He don't care.

1183
01:17:02,557 --> 01:17:04,324
"Don't care" ain't permission.

1184
01:17:04,574 --> 01:17:06,618
Well, he said it
in front of witnesses.

1185
01:17:07,061 --> 01:17:13,876
Well, was that before or after
you got shot, hmm?

1186
01:17:14,126 --> 01:17:18,289
I will not defy McCoy or any man
when it comes to his daughter.

1187
01:17:18,839 --> 01:17:20,891
Daddy, please, if you-

1188
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:21,842
If you give permission,

1189
01:17:22,209 --> 01:17:23,594
he'll surely come around.

1190
01:17:23,844 --> 01:17:26,331
God damn it, boy!
They tried to kill you!

1191
01:17:26,581 --> 01:17:29,567
Now you want to marry into that?

1192
01:17:29,817 --> 01:17:32,770
You know what?
This ain't right.

1193
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,488
Me and her want to be man and wife-

1194
01:17:35,656 --> 01:17:37,342
Now, we're both of age.

1195
01:17:37,592 --> 01:17:41,127
Don't be a fool.
You only just met her.

1196
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:45,383
Mama...

1197
01:17:45,633 --> 01:17:47,075
Roseanna's been throwed out.

1198
01:17:50,304 --> 01:17:52,706
She got no place to go.

1199
01:17:53,574 --> 01:17:55,584
You're afflicted, son.

1200
01:17:58,546 --> 01:18:03,534
All right.

1201
01:18:03,784 --> 01:18:07,372
She can stay here until her
family comes for her

1202
01:18:07,622 --> 01:18:08,764
or you two come to your senses.

1203
01:18:09,156 --> 01:18:09,974
Thank you.

1204
01:18:10,224 --> 01:18:13,444
Thank you, mama.

1205
01:18:13,694 --> 01:18:16,605
But she will keep her own name.

1206
01:18:24,001 --> 01:18:27,003
Come on.

1207
01:18:30,974 --> 01:18:32,996
Oh, watch out for that snake.

1208
01:18:33,343 --> 01:18:34,443
I'm just kiddin' ya.

1209
01:18:37,682 --> 01:18:39,333
I never knew this existed.

1210
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:42,437
Been comin' here my whole life.

1211
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,071
It's so beautiful out here.

1212
01:18:44,321 --> 01:18:45,634
Yup.

1213
01:18:52,063 --> 01:18:53,897
What are you doin'?

1214
01:19:02,692 --> 01:19:05,969
Oh, my-you are crazy, johnse.

1215
01:19:12,977 --> 01:19:15,028
Come get in the water with me.

1216
01:19:15,278 --> 01:19:17,197
Out here?

1217
01:19:17,447 --> 01:19:18,875
In the eyes of god?

1218
01:19:19,316 --> 01:19:21,902
God didn't forbid our union.

1219
01:19:22,152 --> 01:19:25,272
Our fathers did.

1220
01:19:25,522 --> 01:19:29,261
God knows we're married
in our hearts.

1221
01:19:29,511 --> 01:19:30,637
Come on.

1222
01:20:14,705 --> 01:20:19,259
See you later, all right?

1223
01:20:19,509 --> 01:20:20,761
What's the matter?

1224
01:20:21,011 --> 01:20:23,546
Hatfield kin.

1225
01:20:26,416 --> 01:20:27,652
Plain ain't right.

1226
01:20:28,451 --> 01:20:32,072
Over a year now Roseanna's
livin' under the Hatfield roof,

1227
01:20:32,322 --> 01:20:33,441
droppin' her skirt
and turnin' out to be

1228
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:35,409
just a steady piece of cake.

1229
01:20:35,659 --> 01:20:37,311
Must make old man Hatfield

1230
01:20:37,561 --> 01:20:39,379
happier'n a banty rooster
in a henhouse,

1231
01:20:39,629 --> 01:20:43,083
having our family so disgraced.

1232
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:45,201
Yup.

1233
01:20:52,142 --> 01:20:53,026
Help ya?

1234
01:20:53,276 --> 01:20:54,221
Frank phillips.

1235
01:20:54,878 --> 01:20:57,832
Work outta the pinkerton office,
louisville, kentucky.

1236
01:20:58,082 --> 01:21:00,267
Lookin' for bob levinger.

1237
01:21:00,517 --> 01:21:02,919
Ain't seen bob in a spell.

1238
01:21:05,923 --> 01:21:07,842
A fella could get himself
into a lot of trouble

1239
01:21:08,092 --> 01:21:09,945
lyin' to a pinkerton man

1240
01:21:10,293 --> 01:21:13,824
with a US Deputy prosecutor
warrant.

1241
01:21:14,074 --> 01:21:18,151
It makes it a federal offense.

1242
01:21:18,401 --> 01:21:22,999
So we're talkin' prison, a big fine.

1243
01:21:23,249 --> 01:21:26,093
A feller could lose his saloon,

1244
01:21:26,343 --> 01:21:30,430
everything he's slaved for.

1245
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:34,167
Time he's outta jail,
he's dead broke.

1246
01:21:34,417 --> 01:21:38,974
His wife's run off with some
dandy carpetbagger.

1247
01:21:39,322 --> 01:21:44,244
I seen it happen.

1248
01:21:44,494 --> 01:21:47,440
Playin' cards, bald one.

1249
01:21:59,409 --> 01:22:01,662
Bob levinger.

1250
01:22:01,912 --> 01:22:03,665
You got no paper
on where you're livin'.

1251
01:22:04,447 --> 01:22:07,635
Squatter, payin' no taxes.

1252
01:22:07,885 --> 01:22:12,105
You've been warned twice by
mail, once by federal officer.

1253
01:22:12,355 --> 01:22:15,176
I'm here to take you in.

1254
01:22:15,426 --> 01:22:18,378
This here's a warrant.

1255
01:22:18,628 --> 01:22:20,313
Ain't legal.

1256
01:22:20,563 --> 01:22:22,550
That land is Hatfield.

1257
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,478
Levingers is cousins to Hatfield.

1258
01:22:25,728 --> 01:22:27,254
My great uncle devil anse,

1259
01:22:27,504 --> 01:22:30,257
he got papers on file at
the land state office.

1260
01:22:30,507 --> 01:22:32,059
Bullshit.

1261
01:22:32,309 --> 01:22:34,154
It's federal property.

1262
01:22:34,945 --> 01:22:37,949
You people think you're on
the land, you own it.

1263
01:22:38,816 --> 01:22:41,619
I'm sayin' that ain't right.

1264
01:22:41,869 --> 01:22:43,204
You can tell your story in court.

1265
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,749
I don't feel like goin' nowheres.

1266
01:22:45,999 --> 01:22:48,709
My little brother ed's
standing behind you,

1267
01:22:48,959 --> 01:22:53,513
and he got a regular navy pistol.

1268
01:22:53,763 --> 01:22:56,009
You still think i'm goin' somewheres?

1269
01:23:19,723 --> 01:23:22,309
Got one.

1270
01:23:22,559 --> 01:23:26,446
Can't find the other.

1271
01:23:26,696 --> 01:23:28,548
Go much deeper, I might kill you.

1272
01:23:28,798 --> 01:23:33,087
'course, if you want,
i'll give it another try.

1273
01:23:33,337 --> 01:23:34,488
You going after that pinker?

1274
01:23:34,738 --> 01:23:37,257
Got to.
Bastard killed our kin.

1275
01:23:37,507 --> 01:23:43,163
I ain't talkin' to you, uncle jim.

1276
01:23:43,413 --> 01:23:47,067
You know damn well the levingers
likely had it comin'.

1277
01:23:47,317 --> 01:23:49,703
Ed and bob always was jackasses.

1278
01:23:49,953 --> 01:23:53,306
Yeah, but they're our jackasses.

1279
01:23:53,556 --> 01:23:57,111
Someone thinks they can take
a shot at our kin,

1280
01:23:57,361 --> 01:24:00,280
pretty soon someone else thinks
they can lay an ambush

1281
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:03,150
and shoot at one of us.

1282
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,819
Hey, do you remember
when we was kids,

1283
01:24:06,069 --> 01:24:09,389
pa told me to go shoot that fox
nosing around the henhouse.

1284
01:24:09,639 --> 01:24:10,557
Yeah.

1285
01:24:10,807 --> 01:24:11,793
You didn't want to kill it.

1286
01:24:12,043 --> 01:24:14,762
You poked fun at me for it.

1287
01:24:15,012 --> 01:24:17,031
Helped me trap it so's we could
take it across the river

1288
01:24:17,281 --> 01:24:20,400
and let it go.

1289
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:23,203
Never come around again.

1290
01:24:23,453 --> 01:24:25,515
And pa, he was none the wiser.

1291
01:24:25,855 --> 01:24:28,575
Well...

1292
01:24:28,825 --> 01:24:30,520
All I'm sayin' is,

1293
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:33,446
smart as you are,

1294
01:24:33,696 --> 01:24:37,450
maybe you can figure out another way.

1295
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:39,653
I hear you, ellison,
but you should know the reason

1296
01:24:39,903 --> 01:24:43,623
that fox didn't ever
come around again.

1297
01:24:43,873 --> 01:24:48,329
After you went home, I killed it.

1298
01:25:16,873 --> 01:25:21,394
Anderson is a good man.

1299
01:25:21,644 --> 01:25:26,366
This trouble 'tween
our families, well...

1300
01:25:26,616 --> 01:25:31,705
Well, it makes it hard for all of us.

1301
01:25:31,955 --> 01:25:36,610
And I got to tell ya,
deep down inside,

1302
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:41,633
I ain't got no belief in you
and johnse bein' together.

1303
01:25:45,502 --> 01:25:48,588
Well...

1304
01:25:48,838 --> 01:25:52,425
We can have a union
in the sight of god.

1305
01:25:52,675 --> 01:25:54,161
You know, and children
that weren't born

1306
01:25:54,411 --> 01:25:55,629
on the wrong side of the bed.

1307
01:25:55,879 --> 01:25:57,798
No.

1308
01:25:58,048 --> 01:26:01,401
No.

1309
01:26:01,651 --> 01:26:05,656
You need to go back to your own,
where you belong.

1310
01:26:07,757 --> 01:26:10,310
Hey.

1311
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,330
I can see you ain't a bad person,

1312
01:26:12,662 --> 01:26:15,792
and this whole thing, it ain't right.

1313
01:26:19,802 --> 01:26:22,555
You askin' me to leave?

1314
01:26:22,805 --> 01:26:25,307
And don't you come back.

1315
01:26:27,944 --> 01:26:33,133
This bullheaded feud between
your pa and my anderson,

1316
01:26:33,383 --> 01:26:36,104
it's a kind of slow poison.

1317
01:26:39,156 --> 01:26:41,317
I inherited 500 acres,

1318
01:26:41,624 --> 01:26:42,843
which I would pass along to you

1319
01:26:43,093 --> 01:26:45,879
on the occasion of your marriage.

1320
01:26:46,129 --> 01:26:47,681
But my land will never be
in Hatfield hands,

1321
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:52,619
I can promise you that.

1322
01:26:52,869 --> 01:26:56,623
Don't worry yourself now, mama.

1323
01:26:56,873 --> 01:27:02,171
Johnse and me ain't never gonna
get married.

1324
01:27:02,812 --> 01:27:05,565
Renounce your Hatfield defiler,

1325
01:27:05,815 --> 01:27:09,669
and your poppy might let you
come home.

1326
01:27:09,919 --> 01:27:14,541
You used to be his favorite.

1327
01:27:14,791 --> 01:27:16,243
In time, you'll meet a suitable boy.

1328
01:27:16,493 --> 01:27:17,344
Mama-

1329
01:27:17,594 --> 01:27:18,345
And you-you-

1330
01:27:18,595 --> 01:27:20,982
It's too late.

1331
01:27:25,135 --> 01:27:28,670
I ain't had my flow in two months.

1332
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:35,829
I don't know what to do.

1333
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:40,418
You come home with a Hatfield
bastard in your belly?

1334
01:27:47,491 --> 01:27:48,508
Hey, mama.

1335
01:27:48,758 --> 01:27:49,809
Where's Roseanna?

1336
01:27:50,059 --> 01:27:52,712
Gone to her family.

1337
01:27:52,962 --> 01:27:54,915
Well, when she comin' back?

1338
01:27:55,165 --> 01:27:58,651
I don't know that she will.

1339
01:27:58,901 --> 01:28:01,937
Might be best for all concerned
if she don't.

1340
01:28:14,151 --> 01:28:16,803
Got 700 acres of corn,

1341
01:28:17,053 --> 01:28:20,974
12% of the tug fork sawmill,

1342
01:28:21,224 --> 01:28:25,745
and nearly 10,000
in financial instruments.

1343
01:28:25,995 --> 01:28:28,081
Only I lack a helpmate,

1344
01:28:28,331 --> 01:28:31,010
a loving wife to share
my good fortune.

1345
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:32,552
I'm sure that any number of women

1346
01:28:32,802 --> 01:28:35,422
would be happy to entertain
your suit.

1347
01:28:35,672 --> 01:28:38,643
Any number I don't care for.

1348
01:28:38,893 --> 01:28:40,593
If you're worried about
the physical relations,

1349
01:28:40,843 --> 01:28:41,661
I could forego-

1350
01:28:41,911 --> 01:28:42,980
I can't marry you, Perry.

1351
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:44,998
I'm having a baby-

1352
01:28:45,248 --> 01:28:46,525
Johnse Hatfield's child.

1353
01:28:52,822 --> 01:28:55,875
That's unfortunate.

1354
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:57,978
But if we're to marry quickly,

1355
01:28:58,228 --> 01:29:01,949
no one would catch on to the
sad truth the child ain't mine.

1356
01:29:02,199 --> 01:29:05,485
Otherwise, your condition will
be all the gossip, you know,

1357
01:29:05,735 --> 01:29:08,089
the Hatfields laughin' about it.

1358
01:29:08,339 --> 01:29:10,383
I'm in love with johnse Hatfield.

1359
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:28,976
Aunt betty?

1360
01:29:29,226 --> 01:29:30,743
Oh!

1361
01:29:30,993 --> 01:29:35,682
Sakes alive, you scared me.

1362
01:29:35,932 --> 01:29:37,384
What are you doin' here, sugar?

1363
01:29:37,634 --> 01:29:39,954
Mama said you'd take me in.

1364
01:29:44,207 --> 01:29:46,408
Ain't nobody else want me.

1365
01:30:14,225 --> 01:30:17,812
Lookin' for a gentleman,
name of frank phillips.

1366
01:30:18,062 --> 01:30:23,372
What's your business with him?

1367
01:30:24,102 --> 01:30:27,370
That there must be bad
frank phillips with that limp.

1368
01:30:27,751 --> 01:30:30,546
I go by the name of phillips,
not the other part.

1369
01:30:30,796 --> 01:30:32,464
So if I was you, i'd mind my tongue.

1370
01:30:32,714 --> 01:30:35,176
Well, ain't you ornery for a cripple?

1371
01:30:35,426 --> 01:30:36,886
I'd give you a lesson in manners,

1372
01:30:37,136 --> 01:30:38,554
but the house required
I check my sidearms

1373
01:30:38,804 --> 01:30:40,973
'fore I went upstairs with jenny lou.

1374
01:30:41,223 --> 01:30:42,959
Well, that's too bad.

1375
01:30:43,209 --> 01:30:44,359
Given your attitude,
I might like seeing

1376
01:30:44,609 --> 01:30:45,360
how good you could use 'em.

1377
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:46,662
Well, ask your dead

1378
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:48,314
back-shootin' relatives, old man.

1379
01:30:48,564 --> 01:30:49,966
Mr. Phillips, I come here
to talk to you,

1380
01:30:50,216 --> 01:30:54,670
not have a shootout
in a damn whorehouse.

1381
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:57,940
After I killed you, I'd have
to explain it to my wife,

1382
01:30:58,190 --> 01:31:00,658
and I wouldn't much look forward
to havin' to do that, so...

1383
01:31:02,794 --> 01:31:04,788
So I'll buy you a drink instead.

1384
01:31:05,331 --> 01:31:08,951
You buy me a bourbon whiskey
straight, Mr. Hatfield.

1385
01:31:09,201 --> 01:31:13,489
But you have to leave your dog
outside.

1386
01:31:13,739 --> 01:31:16,407
He can stay.

1387
01:31:25,584 --> 01:31:28,687
So why did you make the special
trip to parley with me?

1388
01:31:29,154 --> 01:31:32,942
I come here to give you $100
on condition-

1389
01:31:33,192 --> 01:31:36,411
On condition you move on out
of these parts.

1390
01:31:36,661 --> 01:31:38,614
I killed your kin.
Why the payoff?

1391
01:31:38,864 --> 01:31:42,251
Well, it wasn't my first idea,
I promise you.

1392
01:31:43,118 --> 01:31:45,220
Longer you stay around here, people-

1393
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:49,491
People expect me to do something
about you.

1394
01:31:49,741 --> 01:31:51,426
Now, I understand you were
doin' your job,

1395
01:31:51,676 --> 01:31:55,364
and levingers was always
damn fool idiots at best,

1396
01:31:55,614 --> 01:31:59,135
but don't-don't make me raise
my hand against you,

1397
01:31:59,385 --> 01:32:00,136
mr. Phillips.

1398
01:32:00,386 --> 01:32:03,706
I would kill you.

1399
01:32:03,956 --> 01:32:09,078
So take my money and ride on out.

1400
01:32:09,328 --> 01:32:15,450
I'll take your money.
Just don't think I'm runnin'.

1401
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:18,988
You took down the levingers.

1402
01:32:19,238 --> 01:32:21,691
Didn't expect you to lizard out.

1403
01:32:21,941 --> 01:32:25,027
This whole damn thing sticks
in my craw,

1404
01:32:25,277 --> 01:32:27,955
especially with my bad leg.

1405
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:32,000
It was your land claim and your
kin cost me my job.

1406
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:37,239
A skunk's profession.

1407
01:32:37,489 --> 01:32:40,391
Get yourself into something useful.

1408
01:32:46,531 --> 01:32:48,017
You can't go there, johnse.

1409
01:32:48,267 --> 01:32:49,518
You're all drunk and crazy.

1410
01:32:49,768 --> 01:32:51,253
I'm gonna stare old man McCoy
in the eye.

1411
01:32:51,503 --> 01:32:52,438
I'm gonna tell him-

1412
01:32:52,688 --> 01:32:54,090
I'm gonna tell him straight out.

1413
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:56,740
You're gonna get yourself killed.

1414
01:32:58,944 --> 01:33:00,596
Let go of my arm.

1415
01:33:00,846 --> 01:33:03,766
He wants to ride into kentucky
and see old randall McCoy.

1416
01:33:04,016 --> 01:33:06,401
Well, I'm Nancy McCoy,
Roseanna's cousin.

1417
01:33:06,651 --> 01:33:07,703
And I-I gotta go.

1418
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:09,571
Look, if you go there,

1419
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:11,406
they're gonna think
you mean 'em harm.

1420
01:33:11,656 --> 01:33:13,342
Well, I'll shout out,
"i don't mean you no harm!

1421
01:33:13,592 --> 01:33:16,112
I just-I just wanna talk things out."

1422
01:33:16,362 --> 01:33:22,017
Well, if you go with me,
you'll be safe.

1423
01:33:22,267 --> 01:33:23,919
Well, my horse-

1424
01:33:24,169 --> 01:33:26,346
We'll come on back and get it.

1425
01:33:28,073 --> 01:33:29,591
You are-you're Roseanna's
cousin nancy.

1426
01:33:29,841 --> 01:33:32,510
Go on.
That's what I said.

1427
01:33:37,716 --> 01:33:39,318
Oh!

1428
01:33:39,568 --> 01:33:42,104
Yeah...

1429
01:33:42,354 --> 01:33:45,374
I know who you are, 'cause you
look like her, kind of.

1430
01:33:45,624 --> 01:33:47,492
Yah!

1431
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:03,174
Roseanna's cousin nancy.

1432
01:34:09,114 --> 01:34:13,518
You-you kind of look like
Roseanna in the daylight too.

1433
01:34:17,523 --> 01:34:20,275
More at night, though.

1434
01:34:20,525 --> 01:34:25,656
I went and visited my aunt
betty blankenship's yesterday.

1435
01:34:25,906 --> 01:34:28,533
I suppose you know your
once-intended is stayin' there.

1436
01:34:29,401 --> 01:34:30,577
No.

1437
01:34:32,337 --> 01:34:34,456
Guess the old man's still riled

1438
01:34:34,706 --> 01:34:38,727
at how me and her shamed his family.

1439
01:34:38,977 --> 01:34:44,266
Well, especially now that
Roseanna's with child and all.

1440
01:34:44,516 --> 01:34:46,350
What?

1441
01:34:49,654 --> 01:34:53,675
I'm gonna be a daddy?

1442
01:34:54,184 --> 01:34:55,711
Because she carries his child,

1443
01:34:55,961 --> 01:34:58,429
Roseanna believes herself
in love with johnse Hatfield.

1444
01:34:59,498 --> 01:35:01,692
Does our pap know about this?

1445
01:35:01,942 --> 01:35:05,721
Strong as he is, I fear it
may break your father's heart.

1446
01:35:05,971 --> 01:35:10,592
Shame we can't remedy the
situation before he finds out.

1447
01:35:10,842 --> 01:35:12,494
If it weren't for johnse,

1448
01:35:12,744 --> 01:35:13,863
Roseanna might come to her senses

1449
01:35:14,113 --> 01:35:17,466
and accept an offer
of honorable marriage.

1450
01:35:17,716 --> 01:35:19,876
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1451
01:35:20,352 --> 01:35:22,504
Hey...

1452
01:35:22,754 --> 01:35:24,339
What are you doing?

1453
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:26,108
Boys.

1454
01:35:26,967 --> 01:35:27,809
Boys!

1455
01:35:28,059 --> 01:35:29,893
Where are you going?

1456
01:35:49,348 --> 01:35:51,800
Well...

1457
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:55,737
Just the boys I wanna see.

1458
01:35:55,987 --> 01:35:58,974
You can ride with me
to your aunt betty's house.

1459
01:35:59,224 --> 01:36:01,543
I'm going there to rescue my bride,

1460
01:36:01,793 --> 01:36:03,003
make an honest woman of her.

1461
01:36:03,253 --> 01:36:05,214
Just you shut the hell up!

1462
01:36:05,464 --> 01:36:07,257
You ain't lyin' your way out of
it this time.

1463
01:36:07,507 --> 01:36:08,984
I ain't lying.

1464
01:36:09,234 --> 01:36:13,822
Just found out Roseanna's
carrying my baby.

1465
01:36:14,072 --> 01:36:15,991
So I'm going to get her,

1466
01:36:16,241 --> 01:36:19,394
seeing as how our daddies
are being such horses' asses.

1467
01:36:23,515 --> 01:36:26,635
You're dead, Hatfield.
You're gonna be dead!

1468
01:36:26,885 --> 01:36:28,770
Get off of me, tolbert!

1469
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:30,973
Why you want to hurt your future
brother-in-law?

1470
01:36:31,223 --> 01:36:33,617
I'm gonna kill you, 'cause
you soiled my sister's honor!

1471
01:36:33,867 --> 01:36:35,661
I told you, i'm gonna marry her!

1472
01:36:53,111 --> 01:36:56,932
Calvin?

1473
01:36:57,182 --> 01:36:59,668
Randall?

1474
01:36:59,918 --> 01:37:01,670
What's-what are you doing?

1475
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,538
Alifair, get the kids back.

1476
01:37:03,788 --> 01:37:05,857
Git.
Git!

1477
01:37:06,491 --> 01:37:07,943
What are you doin'?

1478
01:37:08,485 --> 01:37:10,879
Are you drunk?

1479
01:37:11,129 --> 01:37:14,574
You weren't gonna tell me, were ya?

1480
01:37:14,824 --> 01:37:18,520
I had to hear it from Perry Cline.

1481
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:20,389
Well, stop.
That's Roseanna's hope chest.

1482
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:21,390
Stop!

1483
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,874
I know what it is!

1484
01:37:30,782 --> 01:37:33,051
Suppose you's wonderin' why
I don't kill you straightaway.

1485
01:37:33,301 --> 01:37:35,428
'Cause you know it ain't right.

1486
01:37:35,678 --> 01:37:37,439
Horseshit!

1487
01:37:37,689 --> 01:37:41,810
I'm gonna blow your brains out
exactly at sunrise,

1488
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,646
like they do in the army.

1489
01:37:44,896 --> 01:37:46,681
See, I want you to know it's comin'.

1490
01:37:46,931 --> 01:37:50,534
And I want you to think about it
for all those hours!

1491
01:37:51,778 --> 01:37:53,088
Feel the kind of torment

1492
01:37:53,338 --> 01:37:55,282
you and all the Hatfields
have brought down on us.

1493
01:37:55,532 --> 01:37:59,261
I respect your sister, tolbert.

1494
01:37:59,511 --> 01:38:01,930
You know that.

1495
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:05,367
Especially now that
she's carrying my baby.

1496
01:38:06,042 --> 01:38:07,919
Let me go find a preacher
and make it legal.

1497
01:38:08,169 --> 01:38:09,796
Well, it's too late for that!

1498
01:38:10,046 --> 01:38:11,640
I'm gonna shoot you dead come dawn,

1499
01:38:11,890 --> 01:38:14,343
and I'm gonna tell you
what time it is

1500
01:38:14,593 --> 01:38:17,345
every hour we get closer!

1501
01:38:20,299 --> 01:38:24,101
Instead of a last meal,
can I-can I get a last request?

1502
01:38:24,352 --> 01:38:26,788
Hell, no!

1503
01:38:27,038 --> 01:38:28,390
What do you want?

1504
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,460
I want to see Roseanna one last time.

1505
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:34,404
I want to say good-bye to her
in a proper way.

1506
01:38:35,213 --> 01:38:37,832
And then I will stand up tall
when you shoot me.

1507
01:38:38,082 --> 01:38:41,336
I swear to god I will.

1508
01:38:41,586 --> 01:38:43,305
And when I get to heaven,

1509
01:38:43,555 --> 01:38:45,006
I won't damn your souls

1510
01:38:45,256 --> 01:38:46,975
and ask god to send you
fryin' to hell

1511
01:38:47,225 --> 01:38:48,918
for what you done to me.

1512
01:38:50,696 --> 01:38:52,747
You're the one going to hell,

1513
01:38:52,997 --> 01:38:58,954
and you ain't gonna be askin'
god for squat.

1514
01:38:59,204 --> 01:39:00,855
Roseanna does love him.

1515
01:39:01,105 --> 01:39:03,058
She'll hate us forever
if we don't allow it.

1516
01:39:03,308 --> 01:39:05,185
No, I said!

1517
01:39:06,345 --> 01:39:08,097
He gets a bowl of stew.

1518
01:39:08,347 --> 01:39:10,699
Nothing else.

1519
01:39:10,949 --> 01:39:13,368
That stew didn't set right with me.

1520
01:39:13,618 --> 01:39:14,703
Do y'all mind if I go home?

1521
01:39:14,953 --> 01:39:16,905
No, sure, bud.

1522
01:39:17,155 --> 01:39:18,840
Come on.

1523
01:39:19,090 --> 01:39:20,992
You shouldn't be here when we do
the killin' anyways.

1524
01:39:21,242 --> 01:39:22,869
Yeah, you're too young.

1525
01:39:23,362 --> 01:39:25,214
I ain't too young.

1526
01:39:25,464 --> 01:39:27,665
I just don't feel so good, all right?

1527
01:39:29,934 --> 01:39:32,154
Bye, bud.

1528
01:39:32,404 --> 01:39:34,130
Hell, I'll see you on the other side.

1529
01:40:17,006 --> 01:40:17,966
I got to talk to my sister.

1530
01:40:18,216 --> 01:40:19,568
Oh, my god, bud.

1531
01:40:19,818 --> 01:40:21,469
What are you doing out in this?

1532
01:40:27,992 --> 01:40:29,126
Mr. Hatfield!

1533
01:40:30,995 --> 01:40:32,939
Mr. Hatfield!

1534
01:40:35,266 --> 01:40:37,100
Mr. Hatfield!

1535
01:40:41,405 --> 01:40:43,658
My brothers have got johnse!

1536
01:40:43,909 --> 01:40:46,161
They're plannin' on killin' him
at dawn!

1537
01:40:46,411 --> 01:40:47,287
Where is he?

1538
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:49,698
If I tell you, you got to swear

1539
01:40:49,948 --> 01:40:51,300
you ain't gonna hurt my brothers!

1540
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:54,736
If my son is safe, no harm
will come to your brothers.

1541
01:40:54,986 --> 01:40:56,254
Now, where is he?

1542
01:40:56,888 --> 01:40:58,707
They got him at my
uncle harmon's old place.

1543
01:40:58,957 --> 01:40:59,924
Go, go, go, go, go.

1544
01:41:00,174 --> 01:41:02,093
Please, Mr. Hatfield, hurry!

1545
01:41:02,343 --> 01:41:04,220
Go on.
I'll get your boots.

1546
01:41:04,470 --> 01:41:05,638
Please!

1547
01:41:09,067 --> 01:41:11,686
Now, johnse, we wouldn't
normally kill you,

1548
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:14,489
'cept there's an honorable man
willing to marry our sister

1549
01:41:14,739 --> 01:41:15,857
soon as you're dead.

1550
01:41:18,977 --> 01:41:21,963
Who's that?

1551
01:41:22,613 --> 01:41:26,134
Lawyer Perry Cline has agreed
to make Roseanna his wife.

1552
01:41:26,384 --> 01:41:30,205
Having a man killed to marry
their woman and take their baby,

1553
01:41:30,455 --> 01:41:32,081
that ain't honorable.

1554
01:41:32,331 --> 01:41:34,758
One hour to go, Hatfield.
