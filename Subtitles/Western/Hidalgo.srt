1
00:00:00,626 --> 00:00:02,753
And he has become Sheikh of Sheikhs.

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:06,423
Whilst you, no more than a brigand.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,260
I am the greatest horseman of the tribe.

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:16,600
I could defeat any rider in the great race,
if I was allowed to sit the back of Al-Hattal.

5
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,811
Why am I not?

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:26,527
Because the sacred is not for sale,
as are you.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,324
If Al-Hattal is not turned out
onto the sands of the Hamad by midnight,

8
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:37,579
I send your head to my uncle,
wrapped in Baghdad silk.

9
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,290
I am warned.

10
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,462
You are promised.

11
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,953
Know that if we all die,

12
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,664
your soul will go straight
to the devil.

13
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,208
And your impure horse, too.

14
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,673
That's far enough, Aziz.

15
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,591
Kill her!

16
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,718
Jazira, run!

17
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,255
Jazira!

18
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,942
Jazira! Jazira!

19
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,029
- Jaffa!

20
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,613
- Give him his head!
- I know what to do!

21
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,503
Let's keep moving, miss.

22
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,425
He pledged his life for me
when I was born worthless.

23
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,511
I'm sorry.

24
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,392
We got to make that tent camp
by sundown.

25
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,154
Please.

26
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,200
I wish you to look at me.

27
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:44,066
Why do I feel that you truly
see me when others do not?

28
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,694
Well, my horse likes you.

29
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:55,244
Even a blind man could see
that you're beautiful.

30
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,960
We must ride.

31
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,463
We will stay off
the camel roads.

32
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,131
What does this mean?

33
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,633
Shunka Wakan.

34
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,177
Big dog.

35
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,096
There's no word in Sioux
for horse.

36
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,933
When the Indians saw the first
one the Spanish brought over,

37
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,436
they didn't know
what the hell it was.

38
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,565
When they saw how it could run,

39
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,483
carry a man through battle,

40
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,611
become his friend for life,

41
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:14,406
well, they figured it had to be
a sacred animal.

42
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,949
Indeed.

43
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:19,995
Did your mother teach you
this wisdom?

44
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,297
I am sorry.

45
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,344
When this race is over,
I will pray five times a day.

46
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,683
Being an infidel, as you are,

47
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:26,895
you cannot be expected
to comprehend.

48
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:30,732
There are those who are chosen
to be winners

49
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,527
and those chosen to be losers.

50
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,614
Allah chooses thus,
and it is written.

51
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,290
You are summoned to the tent
of the lady.

52
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,960
Right now.

53
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:05,434
You know, Yusef,
I once had a three-legged colt.

54
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,102
Born that way.

55
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:10,230
Turned out to be one of the best
roping horses I ever had.

56
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,409
Your mare's running
a good race, ma'am.

57
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,788
She is rather lovely, isn't she?

58
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,498
Good legs on her.

59
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:34,129
Can you envision her offspring
from an Al-Hattal cross?

60
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,557
Aziz was not
a very admirable man.

61
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:50,854
But he was very adept
in researching bloodlines.

62
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:54,525
You have blood
from the red Indian race.

63
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:58,445
You hid it effectively
all your life.

64
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:03,033
I'm not sure
what you're getting at, ma'am.

65
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,078
There's no way for me to win
rights to the Muniqi bloodline

66
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,871
other than to win this race.

67
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:12,167
You, on the other hand,
you have another way to win.

68
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,338
Only one way to win.

69
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,175
Your little mustang
has proven hardy.

70
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:27,641
But the chances of him
crossing Iraq and Syria

71
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:32,855
before Al-Hattal and my mare
are slim at best.

72
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:36,191
Your horse is weakening,
Mr. Hopkins, and you know it.

73
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:40,863
You've taken him so very far
from anything he's ever known.

74
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,574
All for the sake of money.

75
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:48,912
Are you willing to kill him
for money?

76
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,707
The winner's purse is $ 100,000.

77
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,836
Pull out now, and I'll
compensate you 30% in silver

78
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,713
for turning in a serious effort.

79
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:03,260
I've never taken money
for quitting a race.

80
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,411
Well, then, Frank.

81
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,539
Just where are we, then?

82
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,293
Here.

83
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,961
Alone.

84
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,756
In the last corner of Arabia.

85
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,383
Yeah.

86
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:49,973
When you're in a desert,
the sight of green grass

87
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,268
and fresh water can be
mighty tempting.

88
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,105
Sometimes you're
just seeing things.

89
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,275
Indeed, Mr. Hopkins.

90
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,904
Good night, ma'am.

91
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,328
Frank.

92
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,163
What of my offer?

93
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,499
I'll sleep on it.

94
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,919
And all alone.

95
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,838
Shame.

96
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,933
He does not like the milk
of the camel.

97
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,602
But it will keep his liver
from failure.

98
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,814
Appreciate it.

99
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,152
You have visited the tent
of the Christian lady.

100
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,991
I don't like the look
of them front hooves.

101
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,368
That quarter crack
is getting worse.

102
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,162
Another 400 miles
can put him lame.

103
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,665
You must not give up.

104
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:02,462
It might be just time to live
with what we got.

105
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,134
You will prove them right.

106
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,303
That blood is more important
than will.

107
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,348
You will continue your life
hiding who God made you.

108
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,142
Like me.

109
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,894
Jazira.

110
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,864
You done me proud, partner.

111
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,900
Frank Hopkins.

112
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:10,280
I am compelled
to express gratitude.

113
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:34,555
Hidalgo!

114
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,265
Hidalgo!

115
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,661
Good luck, Mr. Hopkins.

116
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,538
Thank you, ma'am.

117
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,164
If I don't see you in Damascus,

118
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,542
I hope you find the stock
you've been looking for.

119
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,294
Oh, I will.

120
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,629
You should have wagered on it.

121
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,844
The cowboy forgot his drink.

122
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:09,858
Do not react.
Remain calm.

123
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,860
And only I speak.
Atimi, no!

124
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,499
Call yourself a great Bedou
raider for killing a camel boy.

125
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,919
For not being able to hold on
to a little harem girl.

126
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,505
You will still pay me my riyals.

127
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,341
But I will exact it from you.

128
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:37,469
And perhaps much more,
Lady English.

129
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:40,013
You will receive nothing

130
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:43,600
unless my horse reaches
that finishing stone first.

131
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,062
They're six days
across the Hammad.

132
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:50,190
You can intercept them
by using the camel road.

133
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,985
Force the American
into the Amal Samheem.

134
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:56,280
Capture Al-Hattal
and keep him secure.

135
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,866
But my horse wins this race.

136
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,618
He made you look quite the fool,
didn't he?

137
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,744
The cowboy.

138
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,123
He will beg me to cut
his throat when...

139
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,375
Do not harm him, Katib.

140
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:14,214
Kill his horse
and let him walk the desert.

141
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,261
There's much for him
to think over.

142
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,264
Hy!

143
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:47,034
Whatever feed was out ahead,
it ain't there no more.

144
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:02,049
"A gift from above.

145
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:04,009
Not a plague."

146
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,440
Once you get past the legs,
it ain't too bad.

147
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,694
Here you go.

148
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:28,116
It goes down pretty smooth,
don't it?

149
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:32,704
Come on. Eat up.
We're back in business.

150
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,654
Let's see who's behind.

151
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:16,665
We are.

152
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:45,444
Jinni, no. Go away.

153
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:16,558
Do not assist me.

154
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,061
Just kill me, please.

155
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,396
Use your weapon.

156
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:27,194
No.

157
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,613
It is Allah's will.

158
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,240
No.

159
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:32,324
No.

160
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,746
Tell you what.

161
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,873
You can do whatever you want
after I get you out of there.

162
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:42,668
No!

163
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:55,264
Jinni.

164
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,641
Jinni.

165
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,145
Jinni.

166
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:04,565
How you doin', partner?

167
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,613
Why you turn back for me?

168
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:17,661
Ain't no prize money worth
a man's life, the way I see it.

169
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:24,042
It is written that God
leads astray whom he wishes

170
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:26,545
and guides whom he wishes.

171
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:29,798
It was God's will
that I die in this race.

172
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,135
Just as it is his will
who shall win.

173
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:35,470
What about your will?

174
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:38,640
What about your horse's will?

175
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:41,727
Seems to me that's what will
get you across a finish line.

176
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:45,397
Only then is it written.

177
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:54,573
Jinni has returned
to carry me home.

178
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,200
Please.

179
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,368
My sword.

180
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,069
- Hidalgo!

181
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:20,863
Get Al-Hattal.

182
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:33,125
Faster. He is escaping.

183
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:38,172
Stop.

184
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:45,304
You heard the Christian woman.

185
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,140
We are not to kill him.

186
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,588
The rope!

187
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,423
Quickly!

188
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:22,424
Hurry!

189
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:32,768
Katib!

190
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:33,977
Look. The trap.

191
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:46,573
Stop. Release the hunters.

192
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:00,128
Come on.
Get up.

193
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:12,057
Look out!

194
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:21,650
Jinni! Jinni!

195
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:26,381
You and your horse have made
enough trouble for me.

196
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:24,690
Nobody hurts my horse.

197
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:03,937
- Whoa.

198
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,694
Settle down.

199
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:12,905
Trust me now.

200
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:37,406
Whoa.

201
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:39,491
Easy, son.

202
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,454
Don't do it, partner.

203
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:46,540
Don't you die on me now.

204
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,417
We're almost home.

205
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,712
We're almost home.

206
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:59,595
We had 'em, brother.

207
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:04,892
We had those boys.

208
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:15,027
You're all right.

209
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:29,917
My old man.

210
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:48,519
Remember that 500-mile
in Missouri?

211
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:51,063
We had three days in the lead.

212
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:55,692
Sitting on that ranch
looking at nothing but green.

213
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:58,070
That's it, partner.

214
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:05,410
If there's a heaven on Earth,
actually, we found it.

215
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:15,170
Well, I reckon if there's
a heaven on Earth,

216
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:17,130
there's gonna be a hell, too.

217
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:25,264
We just couldn't cross her.

218
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:09,808
Help me.

219
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:30,097
Blue child.

220
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:03,255
Can you see it, cowboy?

221
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:07,509
It is the ocean.

222
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:11,597
It is only Al-Hattal now,
cowboy.

223
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,892
You were defeated
before this race began.

224
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:35,037
You will not defeat me.

225
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:40,083
I am born of a great tribe.

226
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:41,877
People of the horse.

227
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,130
So am I.

228
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,642
Okay.

229
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,136
Al-Hattal! Al-Hattal!

230
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:38,160
Camria, praise your stamina.

231
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:45,834
Cowboy! Cowboy!

232
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:12,945
Push her.

233
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:55,571
Let 'er buck!

234
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,390
Ah!

235
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:20,906
Cowboy! Cowboy!

236
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,278
Good race, partner.

237
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:43,572
It is a magnificent horse.

238
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:45,324
Likewise, Prince.

239
00:48:03,175 --> 00:48:05,427
It looks better on you.

240
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:09,056
For many miles,
I did not understand

241
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:11,642
why Allah would wish this on me.

242
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:14,436
Now I understand his will.

243
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:19,608
Be a guest in my house
for as long as you desire.

244
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:20,943
Stay.

245
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:26,657
I've been too far from home
for too long, sir.

246
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:35,207
I lost the race, Frank Hopkins.

247
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,793
But you won a friend.

248
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:39,461
It's a gift.

249
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:54,142
What about your ability
to tell the future?

250
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:57,771
If I had the ability
to foretell the future,

251
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,483
perhaps I would have bet
on a painted horse.

252
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:05,153
Blessings be upon thee.

253
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:07,281
You too, partner.

254
00:49:38,478 --> 00:49:43,358
Is it true, then,
as in the Western stories?

255
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:47,237
The cowboy rides away
into the setting of the sun?

256
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:53,452
But not the same cowboy.

257
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:58,373
We won't forget you.

258
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:03,045
Goodbye.

259
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:09,384
Blue child.

260
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:42,543
Assemble on the rim.

261
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:44,253
30 paces to a stand.

262
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:46,880
Make every shot count.

263
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:52,177
What's this bloke doing?
Bringing them in one at a time?

264
00:51:06,275 --> 00:51:08,110
Lieutenant McNulty?

265
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:09,820
Who are you?

266
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:11,738
Hopkins.

267
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,490
Frank Hopkins.

268
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:16,159
Hopkins?
You bring a dispatch?

269
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:18,036
Yes, sir.

270
00:51:29,923 --> 00:51:32,009
Paid in full?

271
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:44,396
Hold on!
Pull back to the left!

272
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:46,398
- How, Kola.
- How, Kola.

273
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:51,486
Is it true that the chief named Eagle Horn
has returned to the reservation?

274
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:56,909
He has taken the journey.

275
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:08,045
But he knew you won, Far Rider,
in the faraway sand.

276
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,089
Good.

277
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,221
Will you help me with something?

278
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:43,307
Whoa.

279
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,559
Easy.

280
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:49,646
Easy, brother.

281
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,629
Let 'er buck.
