1
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:29,738
We leave the two of you
alone for one summer

2
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:31,001
to go and visit Grandma,

3
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:34,271
and you move us lock, stock,
and barrel to some,

4
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,837
to some dilapidated old house
clear out in the boonies.

5
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:40,406
My social life's goin'
right down the drain.

6
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:41,764
Oh, now, don't you worry, honey.

7
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:44,480
No southern gentleman worth his salt's
gonna let a few miles

8
00:01:44,554 --> 00:01:47,080
stand between him
and a pretty girl like you.

9
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:50,416
You're gonna be with the same friends
in the same school,

10
00:01:50,494 --> 00:01:52,724
and it's just five miles further out.

11
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:56,858
Besides, it's not every day you get
a chance to buy a piece of history.

12
00:01:57,968 --> 00:02:00,164
"Perhaps the most picturesque

13
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:02,638
"and atmospheric

00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,903

00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,540
"the stately manor house was the scene
of many elegant balls until... "

17
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:16,582
Well... You see?

18
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:20,647
It'll be just like that again
as soon as we get it fixed up.

19
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:21,919
Until what?

20
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:25,523
Oh, nothing, nothing.
I... I read you the most important parts.

21
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:28,997
Then, come on, Mama.
Let's see what we're really gettin' into.

22
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,761
Now, Connie Sue, give that book back.
That is my book.

23
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:32,632
Now, now, no fighting'
while I am drivin' this car.

24
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:34,383
Hey, no wonder.
- Oh, really!

25
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:37,468
Listen. "Until the estate fell into ruin

26
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,977

"only by his obsession for gambling. "

30
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:50,651
Oh, come on now, Connie Sue.
Give me the book.

31
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:52,815
- Wait a minute, Mama, there's more.
- I mean it. I'll park the car

32
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:54,152
and you can go read it in the woods
if you want.

33
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:55,419
It is my book. Oh, I'm so angry!
I'm really...

"The final infamy came to the house

"and hung himself

Far out!

38
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,836
Far out? It's gross, that's what it is.

39
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:12,102
Oh, now, come on, children.
That is just enough.

40
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:15,440
Now, Mama, what kind of
a weird place are you dragging' us off to?

41
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:18,482
We are not dragging you off
to any place.

42
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:22,507
Your father and I have purchased
a perfectly astonishing example

43
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:26,318
of authentic Antebellum architecture.
Haven't we, Joe?

44
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,052
I suppose, children, if your mother
is determined to re-live

45
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,562
Gone with the Wind, I think
the least we can do is humor her.

46
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,031
Oh, ho, ho, really?
Since when was it all my idea?

47
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,591
Yeah,
was a bargain, I guess.

48
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:40,602
Who could resist a "fixer upper. "

49
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:43,099
A "fixer upper"?

50
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:46,005
How much of a "fixer upper"?

51
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:49,740
Oh, it's just a, uh, few little things,
you know, here and there.

52
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,411
I think it's gonna be neat livin'
in that old riverboat captain's house.

53
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,678
Right.

54
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,480
There's the turnoff, Dad.

55
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,811
Well, what do you think?

56
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:31,485
Isn't it just the most divine place
you ever did see?

57
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:34,486
I know you and Daddy
are stoked on history,

58
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,720
but I do hope, at least,
there's indoor plumbin'.

59
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,356
Your enthusiasm
is simply overwhelming.

60
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:46,202
Come on, Penelope,
it won't be that bad.

61
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:51,372
I reckon we're the only romantics
in this family, Em.

62
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:54,506
Alexander, give me a hand
with the luggage, son.

63
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:09,323
- Alex, come on. Get a move on.
- Oh, yeah.

64
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,550
Here you go.

65
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,365
And that, too. That's it. Okay.

66
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,004
- it's so huge, it looks like a museum.
- Well, now...

67
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,104
You're gonna need
a whole store full of furniture.

68
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:34,515
Well, darlin', I don't see
where that's such a problem...

69
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:38,614
- Hi there.
- It's so big.

70
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:41,715
- You like it?
- It's different.

71
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,225
Well, it's not much different
than the other house.

72
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:44,852
I mean, that was a colonial, too.

73
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,057
Yeah, I know, but this house feels old.

74
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:51,032
Well, it is old.
That's why your mother and I wanted it.

75
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:53,664
Hey, where's my room?

76
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:56,257
Well, it's right u!) there
at the end of the stairs, first door.

77
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:58,802
Here, here. Take the white ones. Go on.

78
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,502
- Mama, don't baby me.
- I'm not babying you,

79
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,443
but you're so unhappy,
I don't know what to do.

80
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:12,649
- You.
- Who, me?

81
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:15,587
- Oh. Just like I thought.
- I beg your pardon.

82
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:17,252
You're the one.

83
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:18,385
What one?

84
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,192
The one the spirits have waited for.

85
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:22,857
Excuse me. I gotta go.

86
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:27,131
Strange forces are at work here,
mysterious forces of the other world

87
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:29,069
that only you can comprehend.

88
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,039
Alexander!

89
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:32,404
You must be ready, boy.

90
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:36,335
Listen for the call of the spirits.
They'll come to you soon.

91
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:39,746
You must be ready, boy.

92
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,784
Shake a leg, Son.

93
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,114
Why don't you, uh, hotfoot it out
to the barn with these.

94
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:47,714
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Thank you.

95
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:52,628
Oh, every time I see this place,
I love it more.

96
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:57,099
Oh, Joe. I've dreamed of livin'
in a house like this all my life.

97
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:00,562
Miss Scarlett, I'd carry you up
those stairs in fine style

98
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,036
if it weren't for my bad back.

99
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:06,269
Oh, never seems to bother you
on the golf course.

100
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,044
Hey!

101
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:54,986
Hey, what you think you're doin'?

102
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,058
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,758
Who the devil are ya, anyway?

104
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,161
Alexander Armsworth.

105
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:08,700
Well, I got a right to be here,
Mr. Alexander Armsworth.

106
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:14,906
Don't worry about that none.

107
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:18,842
Eases the misery.

108
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:26,385
Ah!

109
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:31,292
Bet you just can't wait to tell
your rich old daddy you found

110
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:35,229
Amory Timmons layin' down
on the job. Huh'?

111
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,396
No, sir.

112
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,526
Well, wouldn't do you no good no how.

113
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:43,597
Today's my day off.

114
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,276
Don't you never tell no one
what to do on their day off.

115
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:54,548
Alexander.

116
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:53,099
Hey there, puppy. Come on, now.

117
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:57,979
I won't hurt you. Come on.
Yeah, that's better.

118
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:02,510
You sure are a funny lookin' old thing,
know that?

119
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,278
Just like an old mop, yeah.

120
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:10,290
How did you manage to
get up here anyway, moppet? Huh?

121
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:12,522
Who do you belong to?

122
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:41,383
Alexander, are you in here?

123
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:44,418
Hey, Alexander?

124
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:46,963
What the heck are you doing
out here, Blossom?

125
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:49,890
Helping my Aunt Vinia to clean.

126
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:53,334
Well, go help then. I don't want you
tagging after me all the time.

127
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,133
There's something I gotta tell Va,
Alexander. Something vital.

128
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:58,470
Something dumb, more likely.

129
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:02,176
You better listen and listen up good
'cause it has to do with

130
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:06,045
mysterious voices from the other world
that only you can comprehend.

131
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:07,344
What are you talking about?

132
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,545
Aunt Vinia just told me
you're a sensitive.

133
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:12,589
Don't take her long to tell.
All she needs is to look at your palm,

134
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:14,646
- or feel your head bumps.
- A what?

135
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:17,125
A sensitive's got second sight...

136
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:20,993
The Dower to see through the darkness
that clouds the minds of mortal men,

137
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:22,429
to see the unseen.

138
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:25,092
Well, how can your Aunt Vinia know
what kind of sight I got?

139
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:27,535
Today’s the first time
she ever laid eyes on me.

140
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,835
<i>And if she believes that stuff,
she's as freaky as you are.</i>

141
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:33,239
You best not scoff, Alexander.

142
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:36,142
Aunt Vinia knows about the other world.

143
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,704
And restless spirits,
them that wander through all eternity

144
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,873
and never find no peace.

145
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,314
Well, I don't believe in ghosts.

146
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:42,977
And I don't believe
in your Aunt Vinia neither,

147
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:46,454
so just stop following me around
with all your stupid stories!

148
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:49,082
Well, you better start believin',
Mr. Smarty-Pants.

149
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:03,567
You must be ready, boy.

150
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:30,478
Moppet!

151
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,950
Come here, girl,
look what I brought you.

152
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,753
Moppet?

153
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:49,093
Who's down there?

154
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,938
Blossom, is that you?

155
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,347
Darn you, Blossom!
You spider-legged spook.

156
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,384
You think you're so funny!

157
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:12,426
You get out of here right now.
I told you to stay away from me.

158
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,381
Oh, now, listen.

159
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:41,321
Be sure and tell George
and all your dear ones I send my love.

160
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,859
Okay. Bye-bye-

161
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:47,357
The nerve!

162
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:51,566
The pure unadulterated nerve
of that woman!

163
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:54,865
Now, how in the world
did Ludee Calhoun ever find out

164
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:58,669
that we were plannin' our open house
for the first Saturday in November?

165
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:02,304
The printer, the caterer, the CIA...

166
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:07,512
In the wars of social one-upsmanship,
Em, everybody is suspect.

167
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:11,178
Ha, ha! Well, I wouldn't be surprised
if she hadn't bribed the painter.

168
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:13,455
He saws now that he doesn't know
when he's gonna be able

169
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:15,116
to finish the outside of the house.

170
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:18,058
- Oh, now, Em.
- Well, I think it's just plain tacky.

171
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:20,255
Her callin' up all sweetness and light

172
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:24,425
to say that she just had to move
her harvest ball up a week early

173
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,197
to accommodate some
very important guests.

174
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,635
Oh, now, listen.

175
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:31,696
She knew... She knew that
we were plannin' our open house.

176
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:38,380
Em, criminal lawyers,
they like to use delaying tactics,

177
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:40,609
but we, uh, corporate attorneys,

178
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:42,879
we like to beat the other fella
to the punch.

179
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,477
What?

180
00:16:44,554 --> 00:16:47,387
How about movin' our party up a week?

181
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:49,391
Oh.

182
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:52,818
We could have one little, uh,
costume party.

183
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:54,856
How delicious! Hmm.

184
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,265
Oh! Oh, how delicious!

185
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:01,565
Oh, but listen now,
not a regular costume party.

186
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:04,072
I mean, not one with ghosts
and goblins and things.

187
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,734
I mean, we'll have to have
something special.

188
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,642
Something to match this house.

189
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:14,214
We'll give a cotillion
with people dressed up,

190
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,775
you know, as they were
in Civil War days.

191
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:20,083
Oh, Joseph, Joseph,
I wouldn't be surprised

192
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:22,921
if Miss Mary Lee Merryweather
herself didn't come.

193
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:24,517
Now, Em,
don't go overboard.

194
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:27,029
She hasn't been to a party in 40 years.

195
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:29,292
Well, only because the parties now

196
00:17:29,365 --> 00:17:31,834
can't hold a candle
to the ones she remembers.

197
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:35,235
But this one will be
just like the old days.

198
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,241
We'll have, um, we'll have mint juleps,

199
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,334
and we'll have party ices and waltzin'.

200
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:46,913
Oh, everybody who is anybody
will be here!

201
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:50,482
Oh, Ludee Calhoun will be
just green with envy!

202
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:54,420
Hey, Dad! Dad!
- Yeah.

203
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,119
Hey, come on, Dad. I'm gonna be late.

204
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,895
- But why aren't you on the school bus?
- Did you miss it?

205
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:03,227
I couldn't pry Connie Sue away
from the bathroom mirror.

206
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,324
Oh, dear, well, you have to
forgive your sister, darlin'.

207
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:07,242
- She's just goin' throuqh a phase.
- Oh, Ma...

208
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:08,702
Now, don't tease.

209
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:10,967
You're gonna be there yourself
before long.

210
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,407
Well, tomorrow we set this household
on a schedule.

211
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:16,002
- About phases? Mmm.
- No, bathrooms.

212
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:19,006
Uh, well, how about a kiss
for your mother?

213
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:20,742
- Ma!
- Oh, Ma!

214
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:22,375
Goodbye, goodbye. Have a good day.

215
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:24,146
Don't forget your paper sack.

216
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,116
Have a good day at school.

217
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,459
- Olav.
- Alexander, your lunch.

218
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,531
Oh!

219
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,629
Thanks.

220
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:43,094
- Hey, Alexander.
- Oh, hey, guys.

221
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:44,367
How do you like
livin' out in the boonies?

222
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,601
It's all right.

223
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:47,507
I wouldn't want to live in an old wreck
of a house like that.

224
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:49,169
It's not no wreck. It's historical.

225
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:52,165
My mother's just hvsterical trying
to fix up an old monstrosity like that.

226
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,739
Aw, what do you know?

227
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,183
Captain Jacques Dumaine
used to live in my house.

228
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:58,619
He was a riverboat captain.
They wrote books about him.

229
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:01,282
Bet you no one that famous
ever lived in your house.

230
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,223
Hey, Alexander,
your girlfriend's wantin' you.

231
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,294
She's not my girlfriend.
Come on, let's go.

232
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:09,364
Alexander, can I talk to you? It's vital.

233
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:11,696
We wouldn't want to keep you from
anything that's vital, Alexander.

234
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:12,962
Hey, Henry!

235
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:15,129
We'll leave you alone
with Miss Cotton Blossom.

236
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:16,330
What is it now?

237
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,397
It's about the thing that's in your barn.
You seen it, didn't you?

238
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:22,342
- Seen what?
- The ghost that's haunting your barn.

239
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:26,743
The only thing in my barn
that I've seen is you.

240
00:19:26,816 --> 00:19:28,716
Last night you took a light up
in the hayloft

241
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:30,548
and you swiped my new dog.

242
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,587
I weren't in your hayloft
last night or never.

243
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:33,918
- Hey, Alexander.
- Hey.

244
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:36,309
You lie so much, you don't know
what's true and what isn't.

245
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:38,350
I do so! I mean, I do not.

246
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,919
Oh, yeah? Well, what about
that time when you told everybody

247
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:42,896
your father was a government agent

248
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:45,195
working on a secret mission in China?

249
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,133
And you don't even have any father.

250
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:50,833
A lot you know. His mission's
so secret, nobody knows about it.

251
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,431
Not even me and Aunt Vinia.

252
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:58,275
I'm sorry, Blossom,
but just quit bugging me.

253
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,480
Bet he would be a secret agent.

254
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:04,986
Somebody brave and special.

255
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,115
Mr. Timmons!

256
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,043
Mr. Timmons!

257
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,751
Here I am. Right here.

258
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:43,183
Yes.

259
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:48,357
Hi, Ms. Armsworth.
You callin' me? Huh?

260
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:52,899
- Indeed I was, Mr. Timmons.
- Well, how you doin'?

261
00:20:53,803 --> 00:20:58,240
I was, uh, I was just takin' a nap.
I was restin'.

262
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:02,039
From what exertions? It is after 4:00.

263
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:05,547
You have not done a lick of work
on that gazebo.

264
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,916
Well, uh, if youse to ask
my professional opinion,

265
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:11,578
I'd say that the Whole place
needed painting.

266
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:15,451
That is not your concern. This is.

267
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:21,395
Listen, I'm gonna do it. I guarantee it.

268
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:23,057
You don't have to worry about that.

269
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:26,800
Well, lam worried... About this.

270
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:27,869
Oops.

271
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:34,073
Ah, you got me there.
I'm sorry about that.

272
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:36,510
It's not gonna happen again.

273
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:38,639
I mean it.

274
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:42,674
Oh, well.
Would you look at this picture, please?

275
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:48,019
I would like our gazebo to be
every bit as beautiful as this one.

276
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,684
Well, that's real pretty.

277
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:56,265
Yep, I can do that. It'll
be picture perfect.

278
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:59,302
- I guarantee. You got my word.
- I hope so.

279
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:04,936
- I'll leave the magazine with you.
- Well, thank you very much.

280
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:07,840
Good day, Mr. Timmons.

281
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:09,711
Ms. Armsworth.

282
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,251
Oh, yeah.

283
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,391
Alexander.

284
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,031
Moppet, where'd you come from?

285
00:23:41,971 --> 00:23:44,133
What is it, girl?
Where are you taking me?

286
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:00,818
Wait, Moppet!

287
00:24:34,823 --> 00:24:36,757
Blossom, you up here?

288
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:50,328
This is one of your dumb tricks.

289
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,670
Come on, enough's enough.

290
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,942
Alexander.

291
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:04,145
Alexander.

292
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:10,425
Wait. Do not go, Alexander.
I need your help.

293
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:19,862
Where are you?

294
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,768
I am in the darkness of the other world.

295
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:26,331
But for a short time it has been
given for me to come to you,

296
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:28,570
to seek you out from among the living.

297
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,208
Me?

298
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,217
Do not be frightened, Alexander.
No harm will come to you.

299
00:25:47,863 --> 00:25:49,831
You must help me, Alexander.

300
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:52,560
We have only a short time
to solve the riddle.

301
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:56,696
The task must be completed before
the midnight hour on All Saints' Eve,

302
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,740
and only you can undertake it.

303
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:01,239
What's All Saints' Eve?

304
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,578
I believe you call it Halloween.

305
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:05,643
Why do I have to help you?

306
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,847
Because you are the one
I have been waiting for

307
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:10,783
all these long wears,
the one with the gift.

308
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:13,788
The one who can release me
from the terrible curse of my uncle.

309
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:15,854
What kind of curse?

310
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:17,016
One which condemned me

311
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:20,323
to wander among the lost souls
and restless spirits,

312
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:22,420
and kept me from my dear parents

313
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,331
who have been searching for me
all these long years.

314
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,064
If you do not help me,
I will never be able to rest in peace.

315
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:34,771
I'd like to help you, honest,
but I don't know anything about curses.

316
00:26:35,244 --> 00:26:39,112
Hear me now, for I may say this
once and only once.

317
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:43,045
"Sleeping lies the murdered lass...

318
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:46,452
"Vainly cries the child of glass...

319
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,219
"When the two shall be as one,

320
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:51,259
"the spirit's journey will be done. "

321
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:54,662
That doesn't make any sense.

322
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,963
You must find the sense.
You must solve the riddle,

323
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,297
and you must do it soon.

324
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,339
Now, repeat it quickly.
I must be certain that you remember.

325
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,599
"Sleeping lies the murdered lass...

326
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:14,043
"Vainly cries the child of glass...

327
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:17,881
"When the two shall be as one,

328
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:19,580
"The Spirit's journey will be done. "

329
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,751
What does it all mean?

330
00:27:22,157 --> 00:27:25,286
You must learn its secret for me
and solve the mystery

331
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,024
that has kept me from my eternal rest
for more than 100 years.

332
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:32,799
I must go now, Alexander.
Do not fail me.

333
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:36,031
Release me from my prison or I will
haunt you for the rest of your days.

334
00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:39,369
Haunt me? Wait a minute.
I don't even know who you are.

335
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,039
Inez Dumaine.

336
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:45,906
But what do I do? Where do I start?

337
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,755
Early bird catches the bathroom.

338
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:01,887
Like mother, like daughter.

339
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:05,096
Um, could I talk to you for a minute?

340
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:06,825
Sure.

341
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,199
It's kind of private.

342
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:12,735
Well, uh, let's take it in your office.

343
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:25,077
- Dad?
- Hmm?

344
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:28,179
Do you think it's possible
for some people to know special things

345
00:28:28,257 --> 00:28:31,158
about spirits and ghosts
and stuff like that?

346
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:35,160
Well, I'm more interested in fact
than in fancy, Alexander.

347
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:39,834
But there are people that, uh, study
what they call "psychic phenomena. "

348
00:28:39,902 --> 00:28:42,303
Of course, you hear stories all the time.

349
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:44,465
I even heard the ghost
of old Captain Dumaine

350
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:46,667
still roams around this place
every now and then.

351
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,940
Supposed to be looking
for a hidden treasure.

352
00:28:49,011 --> 00:28:51,139
Treasure? In our house?

353
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,450
A fortune in diamonds, so they saw',
around this place somewhere.

354
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:56,450
If he didn't find it, could we look for it?

355
00:28:56,518 --> 00:28:58,885
Oh, don't go getting'
your hopes up, Alexander.

356
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:00,444
It's just a good story.

357
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:03,548
I think the fearsome ghost is
the invention of Mr. Amory Timmons.

358
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,895
Well, my ghost isn't bad.
She's in trouble and she needs help.

359
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:10,026
Slow down, Alexander.

360
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,799
Who's in trouble?

361
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:13,700
Inez Dumaine.

362
00:29:15,037 --> 00:29:17,005
I saw her last night, out in the hayloft.

363
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:21,365
You know what I think?
I think you've been dreaming.

364
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,339
Nuh-uh. It was real.

365
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,748
The dog woke me up, Moppet.

366
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:29,011
Alexander, there's no dog in this place.

367
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:31,444
But you don't understand.

368
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,218
I understand that young men have
overactive imaginations.

369
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:38,123
Then you don't believe me.

370
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,591
I believe that you believe you saw her.

371
00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:43,222
Uh, let me make a suggestion.

372
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:44,894
Why don't you leave off
reading these books

373
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:46,457
before you go to sleep at night?

374
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,682
First thinq you know, you're gonna be
seeing ghosts everywhere.

375
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,229
Next.

376
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:54,906
Come on, snap to it.
You're gonna miss your school bus.

377
00:30:07,956 --> 00:30:09,048
Boo!

378
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,094
Crass, Blossom. Very crass.

379
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:15,255
Who'd you think it was? The ghost?

380
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:18,660
I got some stuff for us to use.

381
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:21,203
Long as we're dealin' with beings
from the other world,

382
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:24,034
we may need 'em.
I got 'em from my Aunt Vinia.

383
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:26,040
She sells them,
and they're all guaranteed.

384
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:28,039
Aw, come on.

385
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:32,709
These are lodestones
to drive off bad luck and draw good.

386
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,847
And that chamois has brimstone in it
for keepin' away evil spirits.

387
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,317
This here is shem-shem-touras,
the 10th Seal of Mercury.

388
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,687
What's that?

389
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:46,092
Tail of a black cat.
Witch-Sayers use 'em to spot witches.

390
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:48,190
You put it on your nose, like this,

391
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,391
and look across it,
and they become visible.

392
00:30:50,465 --> 00:30:53,833
What's the matter with you?
That stuffs not good for anything.

393
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:56,595
I figured if it worked
on witches and such,

394
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:59,368
we ought to make it work
on that ghost, too.

395
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,933
Look, if there is a ghost,
and I'm not saying

396
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,500
there is or there isn't.

397
00:31:03,578 --> 00:31:05,945
It's my ghost and I'm the one
that's a sensitive.

398
00:31:06,648 --> 00:31:09,674
So, just take vour old junk
and quit tryin' to butt in on everything.

399
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:12,586
Is it the ghost of Inez Dumaine?

400
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:14,678
What do you know
about Inez Dumaine?

401
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:18,522
It is her. Oh, my goodness.

402
00:31:18,827 --> 00:31:20,192
Tell me what you know!

403
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:23,224
I don't know much,
but my Aunt Vinia does.

404
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,397
She can tell you all sorts of things
about spooks and ghosts.

405
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:28,862
We can go ask her right after school.

406
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:30,933
It ain't very far.

407
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:33,441
We live right through them woods
over yonder.

408
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:35,239
I'll think about it.

409
00:31:35,911 --> 00:31:37,401
You do that, Alexander.

410
00:31:50,926 --> 00:31:52,587
What's the matter?

411
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:54,329
This is stupid.

412
00:31:54,396 --> 00:31:57,058
You want to find out about
Inez Dumaine, don't you?

413
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,598
What are these?

414
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:31,326
Fish eyes.

415
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,298
We got dried bat wings
and jellied turkey gizzards, too.

416
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,768
Want me to show ya?

417
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:37,805
Oh, you've seen her.

418
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,273
You've seen Inez Dumaine,

419
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:42,902
didn't ya, boy?

420
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:45,876
I tried to reach her myself,

421
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:49,180
but I couldn't.

422
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,953
Aunt Vinia, we want you to tell us
all about her.

423
00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:00,819
Folks'd say she was the only child
of a rich New Orleans family.

424
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,297
And when the Yankees was comin',

425
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:07,233
her ma and pa sent her to stay
with her uncle for safekeepin'

426
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:11,364
in that big old house
you're staying in now.

427
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:14,571
What happened to her?

428
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:16,442
She died.

429
00:33:17,812 --> 00:33:18,812
Nobody knows

430
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,415
exactly.

431
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,356
Folks iust thought her crazy
old uncle, Jacques Dumaine

432
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,187
had somethin' to do with it.

433
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,192
They saw-

434
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,127
Maybe he did. Maybe he didn't.

435
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:38,599
All I know is she died

436
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:41,193
and nobody could Drove nothing
one way or the other.

437
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:43,036
Well, she gave me a riddle to solve

438
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:44,835
and it has something about murder in it.

439
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:46,533
Recite it to me, boy.

440
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:50,368
"Sleeping lies the murdered lass...

441
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,346
"Vainly cries the child of glass...

442
00:33:53,415 --> 00:33:55,008
"When the two shall be as one,

443
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,812
"the spirit’s journey will be done. "

444
00:33:56,885 --> 00:33:58,614
Oh, that poor child.

445
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,418
What does it mean?

446
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:04,948
The spirits have chosen you
to discover that.

447
00:34:06,061 --> 00:34:08,428
I have to figure it out before
midnight on Halloween.

448
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:11,225
She said if I don't do it by then,

449
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,529
she'll never be able
to go to her eternal rest.

450
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:17,836
That's 'cause she has unfinished
business from her earthly life.

451
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:21,031
Well, if I only knew where to start.

452
00:34:22,077 --> 00:34:24,307
There's only one place to start, boy.

453
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:28,043
That's where the dead lie sleeping
in eternal silence.

454
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,850
Where the restless spirits
stand guard over the earthly remains.

455
00:34:57,912 --> 00:35:00,643
What are you waiting for?
I gotta be home by 9:00.

456
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,218
I ain't never been in
no graveyard before.

457
00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:07,619
It's spooky.

458
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:11,153
I thought you knew all about
graveyards and ghosts,

459
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:12,591
and things from the other world.

460
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,693
Not me, my Aunt Vinia.

461
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,091
Come on!

462
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:30,665
Dumaine.

463
00:36:44,853 --> 00:36:46,321
Maybe we better forget it.

464
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:48,951
I think I just about...

465
00:36:52,827 --> 00:36:53,953
Got it.

466
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,232
Go ahead. You wanted to see
where she's buried.

467
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:07,342
Not me.

468
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:09,537
You're a boy, and boys go first.

469
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:14,044
Whatever happened to women's lib?

470
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:15,241
You chicken?

471
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,025
Will you stop that?

472
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:58,683
"Captain Jacques Dumaine. "

473
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:22,078
It's her.
Oh, my goodness.

474
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,117
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

475
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:30,021
Alexander, let's get out of here.
I'm scared.

476
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:32,355
Will you be quiet? I'm trying to think.

477
00:38:33,261 --> 00:38:34,729
Well, can't you think outside?

478
00:38:34,796 --> 00:38:36,992
I think a whole lot better
when I'm outside.

479
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:41,466
"Sleeping lies the murdered lass.

480
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:45,138
"Sleeping lies the... "

481
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:48,872
<i>Blossom, this is it.</i>

482
00:38:50,512 --> 00:38:51,980
This is where Inez is sleepin'.

483
00:38:52,046 --> 00:38:54,566
This is where she's buried.
That's the first part of the riddle.

484
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,843
Please, let's go, Alexander.

485
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,977
I don't want to hear about
no murder in here.

486
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:01,719
If I could only figure out the second part.

487
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:05,851
"Vainly cries the child of glass. "

488
00:39:07,462 --> 00:39:09,191
What's a child of glass?

489
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:39,819
This is dumb. We don't even know
what we're lookin' for.

490
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:42,762
What's a child of glass, anyway?

491
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,434
How do I look?

492
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,799
I thought you wanted to help.

493
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:54,001
I am helpin'.
Just got tired of lookin', that's all.

494
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:57,170
- Well, I'm tired of looking, too.
- Why don't you stop, then?

495
00:39:57,245 --> 00:40:00,044
We ain't gonna find nothing
in all this old junk up here.

496
00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:02,549
No, do not stop, Alexander.
I need you.

497
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,915
No, do not stop, Alexander.
I need you.

498
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:06,887
Who said that?

499
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:11,589
Inez, is that you?

500
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:16,393
It's the spirit.

501
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,269
Come on, Inez.
What are you trying to do, scare us?

502
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,729
Alexander, I am afraid.

503
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:26,502
You're afraid!

504
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,510
Tell me, Alexander,
have you solved the riddle?

505
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:31,011
Do you have the answer?

506
00:40:32,614 --> 00:40:35,083
Well, not exactly.

507
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:38,244
<i>I figured out the first Dart, though,
about the murdered lass,</i>

508
00:40:39,621 --> 00:40:41,715
but I don't know what
a child of glass is yet.

509
00:40:42,156 --> 00:40:44,488
You must hurry. My time is so short.

510
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,525
We'll figure it out, Inez.

511
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:51,061
Well, this is Blossom Culp.
She's helpin' me.

512
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:53,101
Pleased to meet ya.

513
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,033
Enchantée, mademoiselle.

514
00:40:55,103 --> 00:40:58,903
Inez, does the riddle have
anything to do with the treasure?

515
00:41:00,008 --> 00:41:01,908
- Treasure?
- What treasure?

516
00:41:01,976 --> 00:41:04,138
The Dumaine treasure.
Don't you remember that?

517
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,238
No, I do not.
Why do you talk of treasure?

518
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:08,810
What treasure?

519
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,403
Well, Dad saws it's supposed to be
hidden somewhere around here.

520
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:14,218
Alexander, do not speak of
this treasure again.

521
00:41:14,288 --> 00:41:15,585
Remember what you are to do.

522
00:41:15,657 --> 00:41:18,354
I am depending on you to free me
from this terrible curse.

523
00:41:18,426 --> 00:41:20,588
- What treasure?
- Will you stay out of this?

524
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,261
I hope you understand...

525
00:41:23,331 --> 00:41:26,699
All I understand is that
you're my only chance to be free.

526
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,564
Help me, Alexander.

527
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,968
Oh, my goodness.

528
00:41:37,445 --> 00:41:40,972
But, Ma, you don't understand.
I don't have much time.

529
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:43,347
I gotta figure out the riddle
by tomorrow, midnight.

530
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,877
What I understand is that you are
using the most outlandish excuse

531
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:49,685
to get out of your doing
your share of the work.

532
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,657
A ghost in distress!

533
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:53,194
I mean, now, really, Alexander...

534
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:57,596
- But, Mom!
- Oh, no. Oh! Oh, no!

535
00:41:57,665 --> 00:42:01,101
Alexander,
go fetch your father, quick. Oh!

536
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,360
Mr. Timmons!

537
00:42:04,906 --> 00:42:07,238
Hey! How are ya doing, ma'am?

538
00:42:07,308 --> 00:42:09,140
Well, I done her. What ya think?

539
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,139
Well, I...

540
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:13,943
Picture perfect! Isn't that what
you promised me, Mr. Timmons?

541
00:42:14,015 --> 00:42:16,541
That's right, ma'am.
Looks pretty good to me, huh?

542
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,010
You are inebriated again.

543
00:42:19,087 --> 00:42:22,489
You sure love using them
big words, don't ya?

544
00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:23,752
Em!

545
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,294
- What's the trouble, Em?
- Well, I...

546
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:34,099
This gazebo is a disaster
and this man is a...

547
00:42:34,836 --> 00:42:36,167
- Disgrace.
- Well,

548
00:42:36,237 --> 00:42:38,569
this dumb thing
ain't worth nothin' no how.

549
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:42,242
I was going to string it with these lights,

550
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,473
and I was gonna serve
my mint juleps in here tonight.

551
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,478
Well, what's all the fuss?

552
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:49,277
The house ain't even painted yet.

553
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:54,110
Really! No one will notice it at night,
and the fuss is...

554
00:42:54,188 --> 00:42:56,589
The fuss is that you have been
drinking so much

555
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,217
that you have not been
able to finish your work today.

556
00:42:59,293 --> 00:43:00,658
The fuss is...

557
00:43:00,728 --> 00:43:03,254
I want you off this place
as fast as you can get packed.

558
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,992
Now, wait a minute.

559
00:43:06,434 --> 00:43:08,334
See, you can't kick me off. I've been...

560
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:13,102
I've been taking care of this place
for more than 20 years.

561
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:15,641
We've been more than patient
with you, Mr. Timmons.

562
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,639
You can't say that you weren't warned.

563
00:43:18,146 --> 00:43:20,308
Just too do you think you are,
Mr. High and Mighty?

564
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:21,948
Huh?

565
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,776
You think 'cause you come along here
buying all this property,

566
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,217
you got a lot of money,
that makes you somethin'.

567
00:43:26,287 --> 00:43:27,652
Is that what you think?

568
00:43:27,722 --> 00:43:30,089
You think when you say "jump,"
the whole world's gonna jump?

569
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:35,096
Let me tell Va somethin'.
That money don't make you nothin'.

570
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,298
Nothing at all.

571
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:39,327
A lot of us poor people,

572
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,767
we've been around here
a long time before you ever come.

573
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:44,100
We're gonna be in here
a long time after you go.

574
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:46,140
Don't you never forget that!

575
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,039
All right, Timmons. You had your say.

576
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,109
Now, You gonna clear out
or am I gonna have to throw you out?

577
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,378
Just take it easy. I'm gonna go.

578
00:43:54,448 --> 00:43:56,610
You don't have to throw
nobody nowhere.

579
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,589
You think just 'cause you run
Jefferson County

580
00:44:01,656 --> 00:44:03,624
and everybody in it, that you run me?

581
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:05,284
Well, let me tell you
somethin' real clear.

582
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,454
You don't run no Amory Timmons!
Not at all.

583
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,959
That's what's due you.

584
00:44:16,704 --> 00:44:18,900
You ain't heard the last of me, bub.

585
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,409
Missy.

586
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,677
Come on in.

587
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,945
Oh, I don't know what
I'm going to do.

588
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,725
Alexander, I've been lookin' for you.

589
00:44:38,793 --> 00:44:40,473
I gotta talk to you about somethin' vital!

590
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,423
- I can't talk now.
- But I said it's vital!

591
00:44:43,965 --> 00:44:45,763
Okay, what's so vital?

592
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:47,430
I've been thinkin'.

593
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:50,436
Maybe we ain't been going about this
lookin' business in the right way.

594
00:44:50,504 --> 00:44:53,804
- What do you mean?
- We ain't looked in the crystal ball yet.

595
00:44:54,408 --> 00:44:57,708
You're not gonna start with
all that witchcraft stuff again.

596
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,507
You want to help Inez or not?

597
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:03,611
Sure, but what do you know
about crystal balls?

598
00:45:03,985 --> 00:45:05,783
Aunt Vinia's got a crystal ball.

599
00:45:05,853 --> 00:45:08,015
I watched her plentv of times.
I know what to do.

600
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:14,224
Okay, but I gotta finish this first
or Mom will have my hide.

601
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:16,558
I'll be waiting.

602
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:22,199
Blossom, are you here?

603
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:30,275
What are you made up for?

604
00:45:30,611 --> 00:45:35,515
Hush. We gotta prepare ourselves
to enter the world of the spirits.

605
00:45:44,392 --> 00:45:46,019
Sit down at the table.

606
00:45:56,137 --> 00:45:57,696
Look, Alexander,

607
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,371
deep down into the crystal ball.

608
00:46:05,212 --> 00:46:09,945
Look how peaceful and quiet.
And listen.

609
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,953
Listen to the spirits
calling you from beyond.

610
00:46:15,323 --> 00:46:16,654
Alexander.

611
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,056
Alexander.

612
00:46:29,603 --> 00:46:31,867
Alexander.

613
00:46:37,478 --> 00:46:39,310
Alexander, what is it?

614
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,781
What are you looking at?

615
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,349
Something's holding me.

616
00:46:46,587 --> 00:46:48,248
Some kind of force.

617
00:46:49,857 --> 00:46:51,621
Oh, my goodness, I done it.

618
00:46:52,126 --> 00:46:53,924
I've really done it.

619
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,397
Alexander, look.

620
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,867
Inez, are you ready, mon chéri?

621
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:10,444
Oh, Maman. Must I go?
I do not want to leave you and Papa.

622
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:11,569
Oh.

623
00:47:11,645 --> 00:47:13,545
Mais oui, mon petit cho...

624
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:18,107
There is no other way.
It is no longer safe in New Orleans.

625
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,321
But you have little Brigitte to
watch over you

626
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:24,149
and your beautiful Babette.

627
00:47:26,127 --> 00:47:28,562
Never let it out of your sight.

628
00:47:28,629 --> 00:47:30,028
You must promise me this.

629
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:34,591
Oh yes, Maman. I promise.
I will keep her with me always.

630
00:47:35,703 --> 00:47:40,038
Remember, Inez. Remember
the promise you made to your maman.

631
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:44,738
Maman! Maman! Where are you?
Where have you gone?

632
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:49,613
Elle est morte.
Dead. They're all dead.

633
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:52,376
No, Uncle Jacques. It is not true.

634
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:54,945
Why must you say these things?

635
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,990
Mine now.

636
00:47:58,192 --> 00:48:02,595
Treasure! Diamonds! All mine!

637
00:48:04,698 --> 00:48:06,598
Tell me where they are!

638
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:08,294
I do not know!

639
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,695
Give them to me.

640
00:48:11,238 --> 00:48:14,071
But I cannot.
I do not know where they are.

641
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:19,908
Curse be on you.
You will walk in darkness.

642
00:48:20,748 --> 00:48:23,217
In the spirit world.

643
00:48:23,284 --> 00:48:26,049
Never to meet your dear parents again.

644
00:48:27,054 --> 00:48:28,544
No! Please!

645
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:32,786
Then tell me!
Tell me, where are the diamonds?

646
00:48:44,538 --> 00:48:45,538
<i>Blossom.</i>

647
00:48:46,974 --> 00:48:48,442
It's that doll.

648
00:48:49,376 --> 00:48:51,538
The china doll that she was carrying.

649
00:48:51,612 --> 00:48:54,445
- What?
- That's the child of glass.

650
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:57,778
"When the two shall be as one,

651
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:00,082
"the spirit’s journey will be done. "

652
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:03,886
We gotta find that doll and take it
to where she lies sleeping in the crypt.

653
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,459
Why don't we look
in the hayloft?

654
00:49:07,128 --> 00:49:10,393
Looked there once. I don't remember
seeing any doll, do you?

655
00:49:10,464 --> 00:49:12,125
That's 'cause we weren't looking for it.

656
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:14,128
Well, you’re gonna
have to do the lookin', then.

657
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,101
I gotta get dressed for Mom's party.

658
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:17,228
Alexander.

659
00:49:17,304 --> 00:49:19,830
You're gonna let some old party
keep you from helping that poor girl?

660
00:49:19,907 --> 00:49:23,138
You think I want to det dressed up
in that dumb old costume?

661
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,804
Just so happens that I have to.

662
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,542
If I get grounded
I won't be able to help Inez at all.

663
00:49:28,616 --> 00:49:29,616
Oh.

664
00:49:31,418 --> 00:49:32,749
Tell you what, though.

665
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:35,755
If I hurry, I might have enough time
to check up in the attic.

666
00:49:35,823 --> 00:49:37,757
See if there's any old stuff up there.

667
00:49:37,825 --> 00:49:39,793
You do that, Alexander.

668
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:43,826
I'll look up in the hayloft.
I ain't scared. Much.

669
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:46,924
Oh, there's no reason to be
scared of Inez. We're helping her.

670
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:50,699
Yeah, but I wouldn't want to meet up
with that old Captain, that's for sure.

671
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,542
Alexander,
what have you been doing in the attic?

672
00:49:55,843 --> 00:49:58,744
It's almost 8:00.
You'd better get dressed.

673
00:49:58,812 --> 00:50:00,113
I sure wish
this night was over.

674
00:50:00,114 --> 00:50:01,754
I sure wish
this night was over.

675
00:50:01,782 --> 00:50:05,412
I know it seems like forever when you’re
doing something you think is dumb.

676
00:50:05,486 --> 00:50:09,616
You gotta think of Mama. She wants this
to be an evening to remember.

677
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:12,623
And we ought to help make it that.

678
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:26,673
Hey! Watch it!

679
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,674
Alexander, I know where it is.

680
00:50:28,742 --> 00:50:30,107
Where what is? The doll?

681
00:50:30,411 --> 00:50:31,810
No, the place where Inez...

682
00:50:32,746 --> 00:50:34,544
You know, the place where it happened.

683
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,640
You found where she died?

684
00:50:36,984 --> 00:50:38,474
Yeah, I figured it out.

685
00:50:40,087 --> 00:50:41,919
You'd better be right, Blossom.

686
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:44,651
'Cause I'm gonna
get in a whole lot of trouble.

687
00:50:44,925 --> 00:50:46,222
You'll see.

688
00:50:47,761 --> 00:50:49,490
Where are we goin'?

689
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:51,361
The old well. Come on.

690
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,834
Aw, Blossom, this place is all locked up.

691
00:50:55,903 --> 00:50:57,234
We can get in through here.

692
00:51:13,554 --> 00:51:16,251
That there is the old well.
Under them boards.

693
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,917
I remembered it
when I thought back about Inez falling.

694
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:22,019
'Cause I used to play in here
when I was little.

695
00:51:24,431 --> 00:51:25,762
This is where she died.

696
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:32,834
What are you doing now?

697
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,268
This is three knaves oil.

698
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,702
And this here is two jacks extract.

699
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:43,907
This wonder of the world root
will make the spirits show us

700
00:51:43,984 --> 00:51:47,511
the whereabouts of the things
that was lost. Like the doll.

701
00:51:47,588 --> 00:51:49,147
And the treasure.

702
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,487
If I look through this mirror,

703
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:57,155
I'll be able to see a vision of
where they's hid.

704
00:51:57,831 --> 00:52:00,266
You're weird.
I'm gettin' out of here right now.

705
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,464
You don't want to look no more?

706
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:06,030
I can't. Ma will kill me if I'm late.

707
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:10,968
Wouldn't do to your old party
even if I did get an invite.

708
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:14,013
Hey, hello there.

709
00:52:14,081 --> 00:52:16,106
- Hi, Pete, how do you do?
- Good to see you.

710
00:52:17,484 --> 00:52:19,282
- Happy to see you.
- Au revoir. Yeah.

711
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:26,187
Mr. and Mrs. Desmond?

712
00:52:26,493 --> 00:52:28,484
You know a Mr. and Mrs. Desmond.

713
00:52:35,669 --> 00:52:36,669
Inez?

714
00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:43,804
Inez, you up here?

715
00:53:00,661 --> 00:53:02,857
I ain't steaiin' nothin', Inez.

716
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,592
Honest. Just borrowin'.

717
00:53:07,868 --> 00:53:12,066
I want to see a beautiful ball
like you hear about in the fairy tales.

718
00:53:15,676 --> 00:53:18,771
I'm beholden, Inez. Truly beholden.

719
00:53:29,156 --> 00:53:31,420
I'll probavly be down
at the bank to see you in

720
00:53:31,492 --> 00:53:33,620
another week or so to pay for all this.

721
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:37,263
Yeah, that's rig ht.

722
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,569
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

723
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,978
Excuse me, Mrs. Culp,
will you take these out to the veranda?

724
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,776
Everybody out there is very hungry.

725
00:53:55,849 --> 00:53:57,408
Yes.
- Thank you.

726
00:53:57,785 --> 00:53:59,981
Oh, welcome to our house.

727
00:54:00,053 --> 00:54:02,181
It's so nice to have you here.

728
00:54:02,556 --> 00:54:05,651
Oh, thank you. You think so?
Thank you very much.

729
00:54:05,726 --> 00:54:07,820
Hello. Hello.

730
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,454
Welcome.

731
00:54:10,864 --> 00:54:13,231
Come on. Come on.

732
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,525
Sit.

733
00:54:19,139 --> 00:54:21,631
What is that cat doing in here, darling?

734
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:23,107
Oh, oh, hello, everybody.

735
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,271
Oh, Connie Sue, darling,
would you do me a favor?

736
00:54:25,546 --> 00:54:26,809
Over there is John Gardner.

737
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,712
- Would you dance with him, he's so shy.
- Oh, Mama.

738
00:54:28,782 --> 00:54:30,181
Now don't complain, sweetheart.

739
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,776
Oh, you look so lovely and I love you.

740
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,844
- Oh Mama, please.
- So much.

741
00:54:34,922 --> 00:54:38,654
Oh, Mr. Thompson, would you please
play me that divine waltz you promised,

742
00:54:38,725 --> 00:54:41,626
and don't forget those, uh,
Stephen Foster songs, all right'?

743
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,460
Oh, Stephen Foster? Really,
Mother, how gross.

744
00:54:51,972 --> 00:54:56,500
Oh, Joe, darling, do you think
my grandmother's lamp is safe there?

745
00:54:56,577 --> 00:54:58,477
Well, do you, uh, want me
to move it upstairs?

746
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,378
Oh no, sweetheart, that's not necessary.
But I would appreciate it

747
00:55:01,448 --> 00:55:04,076
if you could just move it
over to the corner a little bit.

748
00:55:04,151 --> 00:55:06,245
Well, now, don't you worry.

749
00:55:08,288 --> 00:55:09,915
Ludee Calhoun.

750
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:21,493
Why, Ludee.

751
00:55:23,437 --> 00:55:26,372
I am so pleased you could come.

752
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,774
Oh, what a perfectly glorious dress.

753
00:55:29,843 --> 00:55:31,311
My great grandmother.

754
00:55:31,378 --> 00:55:36,680
Oh, really? Oh, the only thing I have left
of my great grandmother's is her lamp.

755
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,352
Joe teases me by saving
that's why I wanted this house,

756
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,047
to show it off properly.

757
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:47,450
What a quaint idea for a housewarming.
A Halloween party.

758
00:55:47,995 --> 00:55:49,827
Complete with an old witch.

759
00:55:49,897 --> 00:55:53,595
I was just telling Joe
that a true cotillion

760
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:56,830
is the only way to match
the traditions of this house.

761
00:55:56,904 --> 00:56:01,273
Oh. What a pity you didn't have
a chance to get the outside painted.

762
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,955
But my dear, with all the travelin'
back and forth,

763
00:56:18,025 --> 00:56:20,790
surely you must find the whole thing
terribly, terribly tedious.

764
00:56:22,429 --> 00:56:26,388
Ludee is playing down everything
but she has not missed a detail.

765
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,833
She is positively green with envy.

766
00:56:29,836 --> 00:56:32,464
Well, she is going to be
a lot greener in a minute, hon.

767
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:35,133
You have just scored the social coup
of the decade.

768
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:36,471
What?

769
00:56:36,543 --> 00:56:38,875
Look who's standing in the doorway.

770
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:45,815
There she is,
Miss Mary Lee Merryweather herself.

771
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:49,851
Oh, Miss Merryweather,
what a delightful surprise.

772
00:56:49,923 --> 00:56:52,858
What exquisite lace.

773
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,819
My goodness, you must feel
a great deal better

774
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:57,489
to be going out socially once again.

775
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:02,325
Age and infirmity have nothing to do
with my being a recluse, Ludee.

776
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:06,065
Just the quality of the parties.

777
00:57:06,139 --> 00:57:07,607
Well, lam quite certain
that you will enjoy...

778
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:12,236
Oh, Miss Merryweather, I cannot tell you
how honored we are to have you here.

779
00:57:12,946 --> 00:57:14,778
The honor is mine, Emily.

780
00:57:15,315 --> 00:57:18,410
I so often think of your
dear grandmother.

781
00:57:19,252 --> 00:57:21,346
Maw I have the pleasure,
Miss Mary Lee?

782
00:57:22,289 --> 00:57:25,190
Well, I doubt if it'll be
much of a pleasure, Joseph.

783
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,956
I'm not as young as I used to be.

784
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:33,056
A lovely lady is like fine wine.
Age makes it all the better.

785
00:59:03,223 --> 00:59:05,385
Hey there, Moppet. Good to see you.

786
00:59:09,429 --> 00:59:11,420
Is this the way you solve the riddle?

787
00:59:11,498 --> 00:59:14,661
Do you not realize
we have no time for frivolities?

788
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,326
Well, you don't think I like

789
00:59:16,403 --> 00:59:19,498
being dressed up
in this dumb costume, do you?

790
00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:22,304
Well, if I cut out now, they’ll fix it
so I can't help you at all.

791
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:25,345
But Alexander, you must.
You are my only hope.

792
00:59:25,412 --> 00:59:27,506
If you cannot find the answer
by midnight tomorrow...

793
00:59:27,581 --> 00:59:31,814
I know. I know. I'm out here right now
trying to puzzle it out.

794
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:34,988
I am sorry. I will be very quiet.

795
00:59:35,055 --> 00:59:36,318
I promise.

796
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,698
- Alexander...
- You promised.

797
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,329
I know, but they're playing a waltz.

798
00:59:50,971 --> 00:59:54,601
You know, girls don't make any sense,
not even ghost girls.

799
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,733
Big deal if they're playing a waltz.

800
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,406
I want you to dance with me.

801
00:59:59,113 --> 01:00:01,877
Well, if that doesn't beat all.

802
01:00:01,948 --> 01:00:04,679
At first you’re so all-fired worried
about time slippin' by

803
01:00:04,751 --> 01:00:07,152
and now you want to take time out
to dance?

804
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,585
Come on, Inez.

805
01:00:08,655 --> 01:00:11,784
Please, Alexander.
When I was a little girl,

806
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:15,123
I used to sit on the steps
when I was supposed to be sleeping

807
01:00:15,562 --> 01:00:17,997
and watch Maman and Papa dance

808
01:00:18,064 --> 01:00:20,624
and dream of one day
Waltzing with a handsome beau.

809
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:23,234
But it could not be.

810
01:00:23,303 --> 01:00:26,534
And I may never have another chance
in all eternity.

811
01:00:27,073 --> 01:00:28,541
But I don't know how to waltz.

812
01:00:28,942 --> 01:00:30,774
Come, I will show you.

813
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:36,509
If I were a girl, a real girl,

814
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:37,948
would you dance with me then?

815
01:00:39,586 --> 01:00:40,610
Well, you're not.

816
01:00:40,921 --> 01:00:44,915
To each spirit is given the Dower
to step through the ghostly veil

817
01:00:45,192 --> 01:00:47,854
and once again live
as we were on earth.

818
01:00:47,928 --> 01:00:51,694
The Dower lasts only a short time
and it can only be used once.

819
01:00:53,533 --> 01:00:55,228
Well, you wouldn't want to waste it.

820
01:00:56,369 --> 01:00:58,667
I want this one waltz, Alexander.

821
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,439
I want it with all my heart.

822
01:03:24,985 --> 01:03:26,009
Moppet!

823
01:03:26,086 --> 01:03:27,611
How did that dog get in here?

824
01:03:28,154 --> 01:03:29,849
- Moppet!
- Brigitte!

825
01:03:34,127 --> 01:03:36,095
I'll get her. You stay out here.

826
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:48,741
Oh!

827
01:03:57,317 --> 01:03:58,478
My lamp.

828
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,158
Get on home now.

829
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,531
Where did that thing come from?

830
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,835
Aw, come on, Penelope.
Come on, baby.

831
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:20,645
Connie Sue, Connie Sue,
take that cat upstairs.

832
01:04:20,807 --> 01:04:22,969
Alexander, I want you to get that mutt
out of this house!

833
01:04:23,043 --> 01:04:26,013
I want you to lock it up
and we're gonna talk about this later!

834
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,478
Now, get! Get!

835
01:04:29,015 --> 01:04:31,382
Ludee, dear, please, don't go.

836
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:34,379
Well, I certainly am not going
to stay looking like this.

837
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:36,821
Well, I cannot tell you how bad I feel.

838
01:04:38,358 --> 01:04:40,918
You could not possibly feel
as bad as I do.

839
01:04:40,994 --> 01:04:43,463
Your great grandmother's dress...

840
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:45,089
I thought it was your intent, Emily,

841
01:04:45,165 --> 01:04:47,759
to recreate a more gracious South.

842
01:04:48,068 --> 01:04:50,036
Not Sherman's March to the Sea.

843
01:04:51,204 --> 01:04:54,003
Oh, Ludee. I'm so sorry.

844
01:04:56,242 --> 01:04:59,644
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

845
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:01,705
Oh.

846
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:08,955
Mom, I'm sorry.

847
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,055
Oh.

848
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:12,951
Oh, darling. It's all right.

849
01:05:13,026 --> 01:05:15,723
It's all right. It was an accident.

850
01:05:17,864 --> 01:05:20,526
This is some night to remember, isn't it?

851
01:05:21,568 --> 01:05:25,732
Oh, all my life I've dreamed
of living in a house like this and...

852
01:05:26,706 --> 01:05:29,971
Giving an elegant party
with charming guests

853
01:05:30,043 --> 01:05:32,307
from all of the finest families.

854
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:39,883
And now we have this... Shambles.

855
01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:45,057
Oh, dear.

856
01:05:46,426 --> 01:05:49,987
I guess you think,
I'm just the silliest thing, don't you?

857
01:05:50,463 --> 01:05:51,463
It's all right, honey.

858
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:57,195
You go on now. I'll be all right.

859
01:06:03,109 --> 01:06:04,907
Thank you.

860
01:06:04,978 --> 01:06:06,673
Oh. Oh.

861
01:06:14,354 --> 01:06:16,721
Miss Desmond, here's your shoe.

862
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,816
Thank you, Mr. Armsworth.

863
01:06:19,926 --> 01:06:22,293
- Dad.
- Out. Out.

864
01:06:35,108 --> 01:06:36,269
Emily.

865
01:06:37,343 --> 01:06:39,437
Oh, oh, Miss Merryweather...

866
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:43,772
Whenever Scarlett O'Hara
faced disaster

867
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,751
she always said,
"I'll think about it tomorrow. "

868
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:50,585
And meanwhile, she fortified herself
with a mint julep.

869
01:06:50,657 --> 01:06:52,648
- Oh.
- Won't you join me?

870
01:06:52,725 --> 01:06:54,887
Oh, thank you.

871
01:06:58,464 --> 01:07:01,695
You have done a remarkable job
restoring this place.

872
01:07:02,969 --> 01:07:05,028
Well, I...

873
01:07:05,505 --> 01:07:08,372
I'm afraid the gazebo leans a little.

874
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:12,370
Why, honey, it always did.

875
01:07:49,716 --> 01:07:52,845
Alexander, lam sorry for little Brigitte.

876
01:07:52,919 --> 01:07:55,650
She did not mean to upset the party.
She was frightened.

877
01:07:56,623 --> 01:07:58,682
You just had to show up tonight,
didn't you?

878
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:01,288
You just had to come dancin'.

879
01:08:01,894 --> 01:08:03,374
Well, now I'm in all kinds of trouble

880
01:08:03,429 --> 01:08:04,760
and it's just because of you.

881
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,094
But Alexander...

882
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:09,499
Why’d uou have to pick on me, anyway?
I didn't ask you to come around.

883
01:08:09,569 --> 01:08:11,037
Alexander, please.

884
01:08:11,104 --> 01:08:13,971
Why don't you do find somebody else
to solve your dumb riddle?

885
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,805
I'm tired of all your ghost stuff, anyway.

886
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:22,777
Inez?

887
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:26,509
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

888
01:09:04,991 --> 01:09:06,015
Inez?

889
01:09:14,767 --> 01:09:17,737
I'm really sorry
for those things that I said.

890
01:09:22,342 --> 01:09:24,037
Won't you come back?

891
01:09:25,678 --> 01:09:27,976
I still want to help you, honest.

892
01:09:28,448 --> 01:09:30,314
We don't have much time.

893
01:09:50,703 --> 01:09:53,104
Say I'm trash, will ya? Hah.

894
01:09:54,374 --> 01:09:57,400
Throw me out of my house
after all these years.

895
01:10:01,881 --> 01:10:05,044
You ain't gonna have a house to live in,
Mr. Rich Man.

896
01:10:05,752 --> 01:10:09,086
For your parties and your pretty family.

897
01:10:37,717 --> 01:10:40,209
Come on, burn! Burn!

898
01:11:06,312 --> 01:11:08,872
Come here, you little brat!
Got ya now!

899
01:11:08,948 --> 01:11:10,211
Let me go!

900
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,054
Come here, you!

901
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,665
When I get hold of you!

902
01:11:29,068 --> 01:11:30,627
Where are ya? Come on.

903
01:11:47,286 --> 01:11:48,617
Em!

904
01:11:58,798 --> 01:12:00,095
Hey!

905
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:03,568
- Hey, you there!
Joe! Joe! Joe!

906
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:06,564
- What?
- Alexander's in the barn.

907
01:12:07,507 --> 01:12:09,532
- Oh, my God.
- Wait a minute, Daddy.

908
01:12:09,609 --> 01:12:11,043
I saw him from my window.

909
01:12:13,446 --> 01:12:14,914
Alexander!

910
01:12:16,215 --> 01:12:19,742
Oh, no. Here, Em. Em! No, Em!

911
01:12:20,286 --> 01:12:21,447
Em, no!

912
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:24,420
No, Em!

913
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:33,497
Wait, child.

914
01:12:38,404 --> 01:12:39,599
Well, what happened?

915
01:12:39,672 --> 01:12:41,697
Alexander's in the barn!

916
01:12:46,178 --> 01:12:48,272
Hurry. Please, hurry.

917
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,585
1- L-20, 1-L-20, code 1.

918
01:13:03,429 --> 01:13:06,126
- 11-L-30...
It's like I told you before.

919
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:08,394
Alexander wasn't caught in that fire.

920
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,333
He must've gotten out somehow.

921
01:13:10,403 --> 01:13:11,603
Well, thank the Lord for that.

922
01:13:13,005 --> 01:13:16,202
Where could he be?
He couldn't just vanish into thin air.

923
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:19,271
We'll find him, ma'am.
Now, don't you fret.

924
01:13:22,348 --> 01:13:25,283
We think somebody
deliberately set that fire.

925
01:13:25,351 --> 01:13:28,514
Poured a can of paint thinner over
the dry hay and touched a match to it.

926
01:13:30,923 --> 01:13:32,391
Amory Timmons.

927
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:33,986
<i>Ma' am?</i>

928
01:13:34,794 --> 01:13:38,287
Well, I had to fire him.
He, uh, made some remarks to me.

929
01:13:38,731 --> 01:13:40,563
But I never took him seriously.

930
01:13:40,633 --> 01:13:44,968
We seen Mr. Timmons runnin' off
when we're coming to the fire.

931
01:13:46,138 --> 01:13:47,628
Was he alone?

932
01:13:47,707 --> 01:13:50,005
He was all by himself and
headin' for the river.

933
01:13:50,076 --> 01:13:52,670
I'll get out an all-points bulletin.
We'll get him.

934
01:13:52,745 --> 01:13:55,771
L, I don't... I don't care about
Amory Timmons.

935
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,441
I just want my boy back again.

936
01:13:57,984 --> 01:13:58,984
We'll find him, ma'am.

937
01:14:03,122 --> 01:14:04,248
Moppet!

938
01:14:12,498 --> 01:14:15,259
Is Alexander in there?
Is that what you're trying to tell us?

939
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,033
Come on!

940
01:14:20,006 --> 01:14:23,306
Blossom, where's she going?
Is he in there?

941
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,936
- Alexander!
- Alexander!

942
01:14:26,012 --> 01:14:27,173
- Alex.
- Alexander!

943
01:14:27,613 --> 01:14:30,412
Are you in there? Alexander!

944
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:34,414
Alexander! Alexander, you down there?

945
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,788
I see him!

946
01:14:38,457 --> 01:14:39,982
Where?
- There he is.

947
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,925
He's down there on the ledge.

948
01:14:41,994 --> 01:14:44,656
Do we have any robe around here?
Oh, there.

949
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,630
Get that rope on the wall.

950
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:48,599
Get it for me, would you?
I'm going down.

951
01:14:48,668 --> 01:14:50,864
- I can't let you do that.
- Nothing can stop me.

952
01:14:51,804 --> 01:14:53,932
No, it's crumbling. Now, look at that.

953
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,771
The whole thing could give way.

954
01:14:55,841 --> 01:14:59,675
Now, I'll get some more men out here
and we'll rig up a winch.

955
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:02,339
That stuffs not gonna
support the weight of either one of us.

956
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:05,783
I can do it. Let me take a rope
down to Alexander.

957
01:15:05,851 --> 01:15:08,343
That is out of the question.
It's too dangerous.

958
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:10,549
Mr. Armsworth, please! I could do it.

959
01:15:10,623 --> 01:15:11,784
Yeah, it might work.

960
01:15:12,124 --> 01:15:14,786
If we tied a rope around her and
let her down easy.

961
01:15:15,494 --> 01:15:17,326
Well, it's worth a try, anyway.

962
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:20,391
Mrs. Culp, We can't ask your
niece to do that.

963
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,162
I want to, Aunt Vinia. Please.

964
01:15:27,907 --> 01:15:29,636
She'll be took care of.

965
01:15:34,814 --> 01:15:35,940
All right then.

966
01:15:39,518 --> 01:15:41,919
She'll be fine, just fine.

967
01:15:42,321 --> 01:15:43,811
Won't ya, honey?

968
01:15:49,662 --> 01:15:51,742
All right, Blossom.
Now you stay away from the sides.

969
01:15:52,264 --> 01:15:53,925
That mortar is loose.

970
01:15:53,999 --> 01:15:57,060
One of those stones is liable
to break off on ya.

971
01:15:58,037 --> 01:15:59,300
That's it.

972
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:05,873
Careful, honey. Almost there.

973
01:16:08,247 --> 01:16:10,045
Just a little farther.

974
01:16:12,118 --> 01:16:13,313
I'm here.

975
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:17,684
He's alive. I can see him breathin'.

976
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:21,457
Well now, look, I'm gonna
throw you down another rope

977
01:16:22,128 --> 01:16:25,655
and I want you to put it under his arms...

978
01:16:26,866 --> 01:16:30,325
And then pull that noose tight.

979
01:16:30,603 --> 01:16:31,832
Yes, sir.

980
01:16:59,131 --> 01:17:00,326
You all right, Blossom?

981
01:17:00,966 --> 01:17:02,297
Yeah, I think so.

982
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:03,529
Just hang on, young 'un.

983
01:17:03,602 --> 01:17:06,003
We're gonna try and pull you
back up to the ledge.

984
01:17:06,739 --> 01:17:08,673
Oh, my goodness.

985
01:17:09,475 --> 01:17:10,475
Ow.

986
01:17:11,777 --> 01:17:13,336
Ow. Ow.

987
01:17:25,124 --> 01:17:27,320
- Tie it up, Em. Tie it up, Em.
- Okay.

988
01:17:30,362 --> 01:17:32,888
Alexander,
I got something to show ya.

989
01:17:36,368 --> 01:17:37,460
Blossom?

990
01:17:37,536 --> 01:17:39,664
Yeah, it's me. You all right?

991
01:17:41,807 --> 01:17:43,366
How did you get down here?

992
01:17:44,176 --> 01:17:45,644
On a rope.

993
01:17:46,545 --> 01:17:48,377
<i>Just like Aunt Vinia always says,</i>

994
01:17:48,447 --> 01:17:50,916
good things can come out of bad.

995
01:17:50,983 --> 01:17:54,351
Look, Alexander,
the doll we seen in the crystal ball.

996
01:17:55,654 --> 01:17:56,746
You got it.

997
01:17:57,790 --> 01:17:59,189
That's great.

998
01:18:02,228 --> 01:18:04,060
You better pull him up.

999
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:07,692
- Careful. Careful.
- All right, dear. Up, up.

1000
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:09,763
Come on.

1001
01:18:09,835 --> 01:18:11,894
That's it, come on.

1002
01:18:11,971 --> 01:18:14,497
You'll be fine, Blossom.
Almost.

1003
01:18:14,573 --> 01:18:16,803
Em, give me a hand.
Give me a hand over here.

1004
01:18:16,876 --> 01:18:19,709
Come on, darlin'.
- That's good. All right.

1005
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:23,639
- Come on, darlin'. Come on.
- SHERIFF I got him.

1006
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,144
That's it. All right.

1007
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:28,985
Watch his head... Boy...

1008
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:33,752
- Give me some slack.
- I am! I am!

1009
01:18:35,761 --> 01:18:37,661
All right. All right.

1010
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:40,062
- You're safe now.
- Okay Blossom, honey. You're next.

1011
01:18:42,201 --> 01:18:45,000
- How are you, Alexander?
- I'm okay.

1012
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,074
Got 'er'? Yeah, I got it.

1013
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,142
Go ahead.

1014
01:18:51,343 --> 01:18:53,141
I'll hold it. I'll hold it. Go on.

1015
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:55,445
Atta girl. All right. Got her.

1016
01:18:55,514 --> 01:18:57,209
Now. Hang on. Okay.

1017
01:18:57,283 --> 01:18:59,183
- Slack.
- I'll give you some slack.

1018
01:18:59,718 --> 01:19:01,311
That's a girl.

1019
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:06,356
How are you, Alexander?
You had quite a fall, son.

1020
01:19:06,425 --> 01:19:09,520
- How are you feeling?
- Everything's goin' round in a circle.

1021
01:19:09,595 --> 01:19:11,154
Here, let me see.

1022
01:19:11,730 --> 01:19:13,789
Hey, he might have
a concussion.

1023
01:19:13,866 --> 01:19:17,097
You take him back into the house.
I'll go radio for Doc Adams.

1024
01:19:17,736 --> 01:19:19,670
We'll lift you up now, darlin'. Come on.

1025
01:19:20,406 --> 01:19:21,931
There you go.
There you go.

1026
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:24,237
I don't know how we can ever
thank you, young lady.

1027
01:19:24,743 --> 01:19:25,869
Go. Go.

1028
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,274
Bless your heart.

1029
01:19:35,054 --> 01:19:38,217
"Vainly cries the child of glass. "

1030
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:42,225
That's it, isn't it?

1031
01:19:42,294 --> 01:19:46,458
I think so, and we'll have to get 'em
together before midnight tonight.

1032
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:50,264
Oh, I pray that boy is strong enough
to set her soul to rest.

1033
01:19:50,803 --> 01:19:53,795
If he isn't,
I'll have to try and do it myself.

1034
01:19:54,673 --> 01:19:56,664
Not with that man running loose.

1035
01:19:56,742 --> 01:19:59,803
I promised your ma I'd take care of ya.

1036
01:20:00,346 --> 01:20:02,007
I aim to keep that promise.

1037
01:20:03,615 --> 01:20:05,083
Okay, Phil,

1038
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:07,414
You continue up
Highway 28 to the bridge

1039
01:20:07,486 --> 01:20:09,250
and Sam will meet you there.

1040
01:20:09,321 --> 01:20:10,413
Come in, Sam.

1041
01:20:12,424 --> 01:20:13,482
Right, Sheriff.

1042
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:16,324
Keel) movin' north
along the river shallows.

1043
01:20:19,531 --> 01:20:22,466
Deputy Briggs and his men
are headin' across the hills.

1044
01:20:22,534 --> 01:20:24,832
We're going south through the swamp.

1045
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,371
Right, Sheriff.

1046
01:20:26,438 --> 01:20:30,568
Now, You gotta figure this Timmons
might be a little drunk or crazy or both.

1047
01:20:30,642 --> 01:20:33,543
So, I don't want nobody
trying to be a hero.

1048
01:20:33,612 --> 01:20:36,104
When you spot him,
you give me a holler on the radio.

1049
01:20:36,181 --> 01:20:37,376
Now, you got that?

1050
01:20:37,449 --> 01:20:38,917
Yes, sir.

1051
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,547
Just what do you think you're doing?
You're supposed to stay in bed.

1052
01:21:12,084 --> 01:21:14,985
Well, I can't. I gotta do something.

1053
01:21:15,354 --> 01:21:19,120
- Something vital.
- Have you freaked? It's after 10:00.

1054
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,051
Oh, no.

1055
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,427
I gotta get to the cemetery
before midnight.

1056
01:21:24,496 --> 01:21:25,657
Cemetery?

1057
01:21:26,165 --> 01:21:29,226
Alexander, what kind of
a crazy stunt are you pulling now?

1058
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:33,033
Blossom found the doll,
the child of glass.

1059
01:21:34,039 --> 01:21:36,098
We gotta get it to the crypt.

1060
01:21:36,175 --> 01:21:37,438
Promise you won't tell?

1061
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:40,902
I'll promise no such thing.
Alexander, get back in that bed.

1062
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:42,105
Connie Sue,

1063
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:45,246
how would you like to be a restless spirit

1064
01:21:45,551 --> 01:21:49,010
wandering for a hundred years and
never being able to get to your folks?

1065
01:21:49,088 --> 01:21:51,614
You really did get a bang on the head.

1066
01:21:52,124 --> 01:21:55,321
Alexander, stop this minute,
or I'll have to call Papa.

1067
01:21:55,894 --> 01:21:58,329
I never asked you many favors before,
Connie Sue,

1068
01:21:58,864 --> 01:22:02,698
but I'm asking' you one now,
the most important one in my whole life.

1069
01:22:03,302 --> 01:22:06,602
Please let me help Inez.
I won't be gone for long. Honest!

1070
01:22:21,286 --> 01:22:23,550
- Thanks, Connie Sue.
- Be careful.

1071
01:22:36,301 --> 01:22:37,462
Blossom!

1072
01:22:42,741 --> 01:22:43,970
Where's Blossom?

1073
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:45,510
She ain't here.

1074
01:22:45,577 --> 01:22:47,671
Well, where is she? I gotta talk to her.

1075
01:22:47,746 --> 01:22:49,578
She ran off somewheres.

1076
01:22:50,282 --> 01:22:52,444
What about the doll, the china doll?

1077
01:22:53,352 --> 01:22:54,751
She took it with her.

1078
01:22:58,924 --> 01:23:00,804
Code 1.
Calling Sheriff Muncey.

1079
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:02,959
Where are you, Sheriff?

1080
01:23:07,099 --> 01:23:09,329
At the Dumaine plantation.

1081
01:23:09,635 --> 01:23:12,468
We're setting fresh hounds
on the trail from here.

1082
01:23:12,538 --> 01:23:14,836
We seen Timmons along
Shakedown Road.

1083
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:17,103
Chased him a bit
but he gave us the slip in the woods

1084
01:23:17,176 --> 01:23:19,338
'bout, uh, two miles from the cemetery.

1085
01:23:20,112 --> 01:23:22,638
All right. Stay where you are,
I'm on my way.

1086
01:23:23,282 --> 01:23:24,977
That's where Alexander went, Daddy.

1087
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:26,381
What are you talkin' about?

1088
01:23:26,451 --> 01:23:28,419
He said he had to go
to the old cemetery.

1089
01:23:28,487 --> 01:23:29,886
Well, and you just let him go?

1090
01:23:29,955 --> 01:23:31,389
Well, I didn't know what to do, Daddy.

1091
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,787
Clem! Wait a minute!
I'm coming with you.

1092
01:23:32,858 --> 01:23:35,691
He was carryin' on about
a child of glass and restless spirits.

1093
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:36,956
- I didn't know.
- He had a concussion.

1094
01:23:37,029 --> 01:23:38,861
Now, you should've
called your mother and me.

1095
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:40,865
Well, you just better
start sayin' your prayers, young lady,

1096
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:43,425
that your little brother's all right.

1097
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,509
<i>Blossom, it's me.</i>

1098
01:24:02,654 --> 01:24:03,849
Blossom!

1099
01:24:13,332 --> 01:24:16,791
- Blossom, why don't vou...
- Gotcha, you little brat.

1100
01:24:17,603 --> 01:24:19,503
Didn't think you'd come this way.

1101
01:24:21,506 --> 01:24:24,066
Hear them dogs? Well, they're after me.

1102
01:24:24,743 --> 01:24:28,441
- You better get outta here.
- No, not before there's a little accident.

1103
01:24:28,513 --> 01:24:31,039
See, you're the only one
can put me away.

1104
01:24:31,116 --> 01:24:33,915
You're the only one who seen
what happened. Ain't that true?

1105
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:36,106
- I didn't see anything.
- Ah, You're just sayin' that

1106
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:38,415
30's you can save your skin.

1107
01:24:38,924 --> 01:24:41,416
You'd tell it like that
the moment you got free.

1108
01:24:41,927 --> 01:24:43,827
Well, I hit my head.
I'll tell 'em I can't remember.

1109
01:24:43,895 --> 01:24:45,954
Nah. I can't take no chances.

1110
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:49,092
- They’ll know it was you.
- They won't know it was me.

1111
01:24:49,368 --> 01:24:51,564
They're gonna think it was an accident.

1112
01:24:51,637 --> 01:24:53,662
You're gonna hit your head
on this gravestone.

1113
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,532
Blossom, let's go.

1114
01:24:57,609 --> 01:24:58,770
Come on!

1115
01:25:00,946 --> 01:25:02,209
The doll!

1116
01:25:06,251 --> 01:25:08,515
Ah!

1117
01:25:12,224 --> 01:25:13,714
Alexander, wait!

1118
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:28,634
Alexander!

1119
01:25:30,676 --> 01:25:32,906
You bows, you’re on the left,
move out to the left.

1120
01:25:32,978 --> 01:25:35,018
Youse on the right, get out on the right.
That's it.

1121
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,280
Let's move out.

1122
01:25:42,854 --> 01:25:43,878
Hurry!

1123
01:27:06,538 --> 01:27:09,405
Whew! Think we gave him the slip.

1124
01:27:11,376 --> 01:27:12,400
Yeah.

1125
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:19,483
Alexander.

1126
01:27:21,086 --> 01:27:22,417
It's probably close to midnight.

1127
01:27:23,455 --> 01:27:24,923
You better give me the doll.

1128
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:48,246
Guess that's it. Just hope we're in time.

1129
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:52,146
I wish we could see her again.

1130
01:27:53,752 --> 01:27:57,950
Yeah, I'd like to tell her
I'm sorry for what I said.

1131
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:00,722
And at least say goodbye.

1132
01:28:04,463 --> 01:28:05,988
I reckon she's restin' now.

1133
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:11,799
There you are, you little brats.

1134
01:28:40,198 --> 01:28:41,198
I ain't done nothing.

1135
01:28:41,833 --> 01:28:43,426
You got the wrong guy.

1136
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:51,938
I'm coming.
Help! Stay away! Help! Help!

1137
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:54,570
Help me! There's a haunt back there!

1138
01:28:55,881 --> 01:28:57,781
Help! Get away!

1139
01:29:00,352 --> 01:29:01,376
Help!

1140
01:29:01,453 --> 01:29:03,217
He's runnin' right at us. No.
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

1141
01:29:03,555 --> 01:29:06,991
Help. Help me!
There's a haunt back there.

1142
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:09,124
There's a spirit, right over there!

1143
01:29:09,194 --> 01:29:11,288
Come on, let's get outta here, quick!

1144
01:29:11,696 --> 01:29:13,596
I give up! I give up! Let's go.

1145
01:29:19,905 --> 01:29:22,067
- Thanks, Inez.
- Yeah.

1146
01:29:22,874 --> 01:29:23,874
You saved our lives.

1147
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:25,103
It was my pleasure.

1148
01:29:25,677 --> 01:29:30,547
Inez, I'm really sorry for those
things that I said last night.

1149
01:29:31,283 --> 01:29:32,614
I didn't mean them, honest.

1150
01:29:32,684 --> 01:29:34,015
I know that, Alexander.

1151
01:29:34,819 --> 01:29:37,447
You and Blossom showed me
that such little differences

1152
01:29:37,522 --> 01:29:39,149
between friends do not matter.

1153
01:29:40,025 --> 01:29:43,290
It is only a sign that you care
for each other, n'est-ce pas?

1154
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:54,432
You have found her.
You have found my little Babette.

1155
01:29:55,574 --> 01:29:57,235
That's the child of glass, Inez.

1156
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:58,430
The last part of the riddle.

1157
01:30:22,367 --> 01:30:25,098
<i>Mes arms, you have been very brave.</i>

1158
01:30:25,704 --> 01:30:26,704
Both of you.

1159
01:30:27,372 --> 01:30:29,204
You faced much danger and hardship

1160
01:30:29,274 --> 01:30:33,905
to help me, a stranger, a lost
soul from the other world.

1161
01:30:35,447 --> 01:30:37,506
You gave much
of yourselves for another.

1162
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:41,581
And because you did so,
I may now go to my eternal rest.

1163
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:45,153
If only I could repay your kindness.

1164
01:30:47,592 --> 01:30:49,287
Does this mean we'll
never see you again?

1165
01:30:51,296 --> 01:30:53,060
Not in this life, Alexander.

1166
01:30:54,132 --> 01:30:55,861
We ain't gonna get haunted no more?

1167
01:30:56,234 --> 01:30:58,168
Only by memories, perhaps.

1168
01:31:23,361 --> 01:31:27,559
"When the two shall be as one,
the spirits journey will be done. "

1169
01:31:29,367 --> 01:31:30,801
Goodbye, my friends.

1170
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:32,967
Do not forget me.

1171
01:31:40,545 --> 01:31:41,569
Inez?

1172
01:31:48,219 --> 01:31:49,584
I got something in my eye.

1173
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:55,787
Me, too.

1174
01:32:02,834 --> 01:32:04,529
Look, Alexander, the doll!

1175
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:20,545
Diamonds.

1176
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:23,280
It's the treasure that Captain
Jacques Dumaine was looking for.

1177
01:32:31,362 --> 01:32:33,626
It's her gift to you and me, Blossom.

1178
01:33:16,608 --> 01:33:18,007
Alexander!

1179
01:33:21,146 --> 01:33:22,146
Blossom!
