1
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,080
Hi, Jim.
- Good morning, Mr Watson.

2
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Not a move, Yankee!

3
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,320
Being nursemaid to the Gatling gun
is not my idea of fighting.

4
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,840
Let's not advertise
what we're carrying.

5
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Sorry.

6
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
You got a spare one?

7
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Thanks.

8
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,320
Extend your leave and watch
them test the gun at the arsenal.

9
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,320
Waste of time.

10
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,520
Crazy man's dream.
No gun will shoot 200 shots a minute.

11
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,480
Two hundred and fifty
and Dr Gatling is far from crazy.

12
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,280
I think they're gonna work.

13
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,480
Maybe change the whole
pattern of future wars.

14
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,720
This one if the Rebs get it.

15
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,240
All set?
- Yes and make it look real.

16
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,800
Back - back - back - back, whoa.

17
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,520
Thanks.

18
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,400
I'll go back into the baggage car.

19
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,520
Giddy-up!

20
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Get those horses down!

21
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,400
Hurry!

22
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,520
Don't let them get away!

23
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,640
Hurry, get the horses down!

24
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
Hya!

25
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,440
All clear, Captain.
- Right!

26
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,400
# Tapioca, tapioca

27
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,920
# Tapioca, I ate
till I couldn't see straight

28
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,360
# Working on the railroad,
20 cents a day

29
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,960
# Johnny, pick a tune on your banjo

30
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,960
# Listen to the wheels
go clacking on their way

31
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,000
# Tapioca, tapioca... #
- That's a code song all right.

32
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,600
Give them this.

33
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,160
If you please, Mr Thomson.

34
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,480
Thank you, Mr Farraday.

35
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,760
I'll tell you what to do.

36
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,440
There is no one in this crowd,

37
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,080
there is no one
in this sovereign stste,

38
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,760
there is no one in the universe

39
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,360
who can face himself
in the mirror and say,

40
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,680
"I'm as chock full of health as
the good Lord intended me to be."

41
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,120
There's no one for whom
that ain't necessary.

42
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,480
If I may continue
to have your attention.

43
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,080
I'd like to
introduce my colleague

44
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,520
from Boston, Massachusetts,
Mr Jim Farraday.

45
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Thank you, Mr Thomson.

46
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,480
What is it we all crave? Not money,
not the luxuries money will buy.

47
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,000
It is our physical wellbeing.

48
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,320
# Tapioca, tapioca

49
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,960
# All she ever learned to cook
was tapioca

50
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,840
# For my dinner

51
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,320
# For my supper

52
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,480
# Tapioca I ate till
I couldn't see straight

53
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,840
# Working on the railroad,
20 cents a day

54
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,400
# Johnny, pick a tune on your banjo

55
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,600
# Listen to wheels
go clacking on the way

56
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,160
# Tapioca, tapioca, tapioca
they seem to say. #

57
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
step right up!

58
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,680
It's Dr Sunderland's
Magic Muscle Builder.

59
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,200
He's unarmed.

60
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
What is it?

61
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,600
It's female... and pretty!

62
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,320
Let me see. Come on, let me look!

63
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,560
Yeah... but it's Yankee.

64
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,400
So are we... for the time being.

65
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,840
May I offer my help?

66
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,120
Thank you.
Can you take us to Baxter Springs?

67
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,320
Us?

68
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
My patient and me.

69
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,760
What's he doing over there?

70
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,640
He's worried about his wife, Lukoa.

71
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,840
He worries from a distance.

72
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,080
The Confederates
can't do their own fighting,

73
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,720
so they get the Indians to rebel.

74
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,000
Our army hang
any Indian crossing the river.

75
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,840
Suppose we start moving your things?

76
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Thank you.

77
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,760
It's not a real hospital.
It's one room.

78
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,440
I'll keep it going
till dad gets home.

79
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
When will that be?

80
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,080
When Johnny Rebel admits he's licked
Dad's in the army.

81
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,200
For a nurse you've
a solid hatred from Johnny Rebel.

82
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,440
We've been at war for four years.
Enough time to hate good and hard.

83
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,600
More than enough.

84
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,440
Wouldn't you like a blanket?
You're still damp.

85
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,200
No, thanks. The air will dry me.

86
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,280
You sure I'm not taking you
out of your way?

87
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,320
I wish you were.
Then this would be a real gesture.

88
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,360
It's nice of you anyway.

89
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,400
It's a day's ride to Baxter Springs.
- Good...

90
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,120
Staying long?

91
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,040
I hope so.

92
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,680
It's a pretty town. You'll like it.

93
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,680
I'm sure I will.

94
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,200
I was warned
about travelling salesman.

95
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,720
By whom?

96
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,120
Other travelling salesmen.

97
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,120
A man sees a pretty girl,
he ought to tell her so.

98
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,000
Do you see many in your travels?
Girls, I mean?

99
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,360
Most of the time Benjy. He's good
company but he's not very pretty.

100
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,360
Oh dear!

101
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,680
Sorry. Maybe you'd like
to rest in the back for a while?

102
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,240
We've got a long trip ahead.

103
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
No, I'm all right.

104
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,520
I'm fine.

105
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,760
We might hit another bump.

106
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,040
We might at that.

107
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,800
Tired?
- I'm used to it.

108
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,560
We'll get your things.
What about the hospital wagon?

109
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,560
I'll send for it.

110
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,600
I never thought I'd see it.
- What?

111
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,160
You and a Yankee girl.

112
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,480
A thing like that could start a war!

113
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,200
Over there, Lukoa.

114
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
Just put it anywhere.

115
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,400
Jim, if you get the other things
I can straighten this around.

116
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,400
Fine.

117
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,720
Where do you want them?
- Huh?

118
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,840
Where do you want them?

119
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,360
Oh! On the window seat please.

120
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,400
It was so nice of you to help us.

121
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,040
That's...
- Very kind. My father.

122
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,440
Oh.

123
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,880
It sure takes all kinds, don't it?

124
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,720
I beg your pardon?

125
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,400
It's a funny world.
Your father, proud of his uniform.

126
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,080
Other people like Jim Farraday
never even wore one.

127
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,800
He never was in the army?

128
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,560
But he's young
and he's certainly able-bodied.

129
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,480
He's a fine specimen.

130
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,880
It's for religious reasons.

131
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,480
No, ma'am. He's anti-war
on just straight physical grounds.

132
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,880
He just don't like the
idea of getting shot at.

133
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
Maybe even... killed.

134
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Is that true?

135
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,880
It's the way I feel, Nora.

136
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,240
I can manage now, thank you.

137
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,680
A funny coincidence, our meeting.

138
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,440
You with your nursing home. Us
with Doc Sunderland's Muscle Builder.

139
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,520
Yes...

140
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,640
funny.

141
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,280
Benjy.

142
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,400
# Now gather round, folks,
and hear my song

143
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,440
# It'll make you happy,
it'll make you strong

144
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,880
# If pain and misery is your lot

145
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,960
# Doc Sunderland's remedies
hit the spot

146
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,880
# If what you've got is chronic

147
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:37,400
# There's nothing like his ton... ic

148
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,160
# Cos it builds you up
and it cures your ills

149
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,200
# One bottle's worth
a million pills. #

150
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,520
Come in closer, ladies and gentlemen!

151
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,480
As a favour to yourselves,
come in real close!

152
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,160
Before... and after.

153
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,120
If you please, Mr Thomson?

154
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,240
Yes sir, Mr Farraday.

155
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,240
# Tapioca, tapioca

156
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,320
# Tapioca I ate
till I couldn't see straight

157
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,680
# Working on the railroad
20 cents a day

158
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,280
# Johnny, pick a tune on your banjo

159
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,680
# Listen to the wheels
go clacking on their way

160
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,080
# Tapioca, tapioca, tapioca,
they seem to say. #

161
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,240
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll tell you
what we're going to do.

162
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,280
There's no one in this crowd here,
there's no one in this great state,

163
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,720
there's no one in the universe,

164
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,840
who can face himself
in the mirror and say,

165
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,400
"I'm as chock full of health
as the good Lord intended me to be."

166
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,640
Everyone needs that.

167
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,880
William Shakespeare once wrote...

168
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,960
"Why let pain your pleasure spoil
for want of muscle-building oil?"

169
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,160
That's what Doc Sutherland
is offering you.

170
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,760
The only inside and outside
tonic beneficial to man.

171
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,120
Step right up.
It's 75 cents a bottle.

172
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,760
We won't be back until next year.
The lady wants two.

173
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,000
Surround the building!

174
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,040
Guard that door!

175
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,600
Don't shoot!

176
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,440
Trigger-happy fools!
We wanted him alive.

177
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,240
So what do we do?
- Obey orders.

178
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,880
And have you die and my men too?

179
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,200
Killing him could cost lives
and change the war.

180
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,360
Our wagon's outside if you'd like
to be taken to the hospital.

181
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,360
Thanks. In a minute.

182
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,840
I want this store
locked and guarded.

183
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,960
I'll search it later.

184
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,440
What are you looking for?

185
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,040
Help me up.

186
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,480
You didn't answer.
- No, I didn't.

187
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,920
I don't have to take your orders.
This isn't federal territory.

188
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,200
Let's go before the sheriff
takes over the federal government.

189
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,880
Hey, Doc,
this stuff as good as you claim?

190
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Better.

191
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,640
Muscle Builder? When the
war's over, you should head south.

192
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,960
The Rebs will need it
when we get through with them.

193
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,400
The sheriff can stop us
searching the store.

194
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,840
Not us. I'll do the searching.

195
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,280
All right. He can stop you.

196
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,960
He can't stop a search warrant.

197
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,440
Why not tell him
what you're looking for?

198
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,200
Sure, tell him! Tell everybody!

199
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
Excuse me, lieutenant.

200
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,120
Six bits.

201
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,240
You can spare one bottle.
- Six bits.

202
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,720
Ain't you a patriot?
I've killed Rebs for people like you.

203
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,960
I said six bits!

204
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,720
All right! All right!

205
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,080
Jenkins, give Mr Kelso a hand!

206
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,880
Yes, sir.

207
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,600
Too bad. So expensive.

208
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,240
Look alive, Jenkins.

209
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,240
Yes, sir.

210
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,640
When I saw he was hurt
I suggested bringing him here.

211
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,720
Throw business your way.

212
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,640
I'm not looking for business,
Mr Farraday.

213
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,480
Bring in the other kettle.

214
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,320
Please, Miss Curtis.

215
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Thank you very much.

216
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,080
This will burn just a bit.

217
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,120
Just hold this and press dwn.

218
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,040
I saw your father's picture.
Where's he stationed?

219
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,920
He's with General Sherman in Georgia

220
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,480
I want to be
with Sherman or Sheridan.

221
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,760
We hardly get news of the war.
Travellers have more news than...

222
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,040
Do you hear any war news?

223
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,000
I never listen.

224
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,280
He's a conscientious objector.

225
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,200
Not conscientious, just objecting.

226
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,040
Lucky you weren't in the draft.

227
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
I was, back in Boston.

228
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,120
Boston?
- Sure. Can't you tell?

229
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,040
Of course.

230
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,840
Then why aren't you in the army?

231
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,560
I am, in a way.
I hired a substitute for $300.

232
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,680
Brave fella, they tell me.

233
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,040
I may turn out to be a war hero.

234
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,520
By proxy, of course.

235
00:23:50,966 --> 00:23:55,329
Whoa! I'd like to wipe them
off the face of the Earth.

236
00:23:55,364 --> 00:23:59,693
Business before pleasure.
We can't afford trouble.

237
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:12,289
Let's see how tough fancy clothes is.

238
00:24:13,566 --> 00:24:17,696
One knife, fancy clothes,
you and me to a finish.

239
00:24:17,886 --> 00:24:19,160
About time for a drink.

240
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:23,062
That's why he ain't in uniform.
He's yeller.

241
00:24:23,656 --> 00:24:24,406
Now he ain't so fancy!

242
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:27,610
I'll take him...

243
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:29,659
It's my invitation.

244
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:34,577
Get ready, stranger.

245
00:24:37,296 --> 00:24:39,931
Jenkins, we're betting on you.

246
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:44,460
I'd better stop it.
- No! Let's see if he turns the other cheek.

247
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:48,376
Jenkins is the toughest
fighter I've got.

248
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:50,760
He'll cut that Boston lily to bits.

249
00:24:50,778 --> 00:24:52,746
Don't bet on it.

250
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:02,660
Stick him, Jim, stick him!

251
00:26:02,707 --> 00:26:04,698
No, don't!

252
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:08,560
You should have finished him.
Less to worry about when it's dark.

253
00:26:08,665 --> 00:26:13,101
My men aren't sneaks.
There'll be no trouble.

254
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:16,460
Your men are a headache.
Leave town before they get hurt.

255
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:18,301
By you?

256
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:21,221
Don't play soldier boy with me.

257
00:26:21,256 --> 00:26:22,460
I can get you a coat.

258
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:24,461
Thanks, I have one.

259
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:26,360
I'll buy the drinks later.

260
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,341
Some other time, maybe.

261
00:26:36,786 --> 00:26:38,682
Miss Curtis?

262
00:26:38,717 --> 00:26:40,541
Yes, Mr Kelso?

263
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:44,057
What do you know
about James Farraday?

264
00:26:46,296 --> 00:26:50,778
Nothing. We met by accident
when my wagon broke down.

265
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:53,010
From which direction was he coming?

266
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:58,827
Well... it might have been
east or northeast.

267
00:26:59,816 --> 00:27:01,034
Why?

268
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:03,820
Just curious.

269
00:27:06,576 --> 00:27:10,979
For a man who spends $300
to keep from fighting, he...

270
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:18,781
"General Sheridan scores victory
in Northern Virginia."

271
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:25,975
The Rebs ain't running faster
than that soldier you worked over.

272
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,344
Mister.

273
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:44,950
Yes, sir.

274
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:49,217
James Farraday just sent a telegram.
Let's have it.

275
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:00,503
It's just a regular business message

276
00:28:01,175 --> 00:28:03,180
Yeah, send it.

277
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,308
And... send this for me.

278
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:07,901
Yes, sir.

279
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:26,507
Is that you, Jim?
- It's Lieutenant Green.

280
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:37,785
We don't sell merchandise
after sundown.

281
00:28:37,975 --> 00:28:42,355
We're not buying, we're looking.
A search warrant.

282
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,380
Don't get foolish, pop.

283
00:28:44,415 --> 00:28:48,390
What is this?
We're a legitimate business...

284
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:53,829
Six bits for every bottle you bust.
And five cents for every empty.

285
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:56,750
I'm warning you to be careful.

286
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:58,560
Lieutenant, let's see what's in here

287
00:28:58,582 --> 00:29:01,267
Sergeant.
- Don't touch...

288
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:39,790
The lieutenant came in like

289
00:29:39,825 --> 00:29:44,387
he was Christopher Columbus
discovering America.

290
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:47,307
He called me pop.

291
00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:50,660
Yankees never had no manners.

292
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:51,591
Easy.

293
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:01,990
# I had a brakeman for a husband

294
00:30:02,215 --> 00:30:05,424
# He never made enough
to buy the meat

295
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:08,424
# Oh, don't have
a brakeman for a husband

296
00:30:08,459 --> 00:30:11,389
# Or this is all
you'll ever get to eat

297
00:30:11,424 --> 00:30:13,569
# Tapioca, tapioca

298
00:30:14,265 --> 00:30:17,314
# All he ever could afford
was tapioca

299
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,990
# By the potful, by the carload

300
00:30:20,265 --> 00:30:23,606
# But it came to an end,
I'm a widow again

301
00:30:23,641 --> 00:30:26,948
# Take me on the railroad,
take me far away

302
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:29,630
# Johnny, pick a tune on your banjo

303
00:30:29,665 --> 00:30:33,949
# Listen to the wheels
go clacking on their way

304
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:38,234
# Tapioca, tapioca, tapioca
they seem to say. #

305
00:30:48,785 --> 00:30:53,160
Forgive this intrusion,
but being in the same business...

306
00:30:53,188 --> 00:30:55,310
Run along, I'm spoken for.

307
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:59,160
I know an artist like you
would be surrounded by admirers.

308
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:01,671
No more. I got myself a steady.

309
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:03,770
I'm deeply envious of him.

310
00:31:03,805 --> 00:31:07,360
It was the coincidence of
your song that brought me here.

311
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:09,390
What coincidence?

312
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:12,838
We have been using
that song for months.

313
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:13,810
Am I supposed to cut it out?

314
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:18,831
Not at all. The way you sing it,
you're entitled to it.

315
00:31:18,866 --> 00:31:20,560
I thought you wanted trouble.

316
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,591
Quite the contrary.

317
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:26,840
I really put it over?
- Hmm, big.

318
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,990
Should I do it regular?
- Didn't you sing it before?

319
00:31:30,025 --> 00:31:33,960
First time. It was a request.
- Do you recall who requested it?

320
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:36,009
My steady.

321
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:38,910
Sally, ask Mr Farraday to come in.

322
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:40,918
Won't you come in?

323
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:47,601
Here's that drink we didn't have.

324
00:31:47,636 --> 00:31:49,160
Sally, find another home.

325
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,952
I won't be in the way.

326
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,600
I said find yourself another home.

327
00:31:57,305 --> 00:32:01,605
Sure, sweetie, I don't mind.
I'll be with Laura.

328
00:32:01,675 --> 00:32:04,553
If you want me, knock on the wall.

329
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:08,060
Sally?
- Yes?

330
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:10,084
Close the door.

331
00:32:14,505 --> 00:32:18,555
I'm the man to take you
through the Union lines.

332
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,830
Here's to a no-trouble trip.

333
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:24,806
You're talking way over my head.

334
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:29,920
Farraday,
let's drop the games and save time.

335
00:32:29,955 --> 00:32:34,710
I work for Anderson Smith
running horses for you Rebs.

336
00:32:34,905 --> 00:32:36,660
You need any more proof?

337
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:39,922
I didn't say a word.
I like listening.

338
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:45,520
The longer you take to buy me the
easier it'll be to mess things up.

339
00:32:45,555 --> 00:32:48,960
Kelso checked your telegram.
Now he's checking on you.

340
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:50,999
I'm still listening.

341
00:32:51,195 --> 00:32:54,870
Listen quick.
Smith told me all about you.

342
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:59,638
Farraday's the name of someone
you went to college with.

343
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:04,197
You are Captain James Simmonds,
Georgia Volunteers.

344
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,375
Your brother was killed
at Bull Run.

345
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,519
Your pitchman's Benjamin Guterman.

346
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:11,960
More?

347
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:13,718
No.

348
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:18,957
You've got enough to hang
Benjy and me three times over.

349
00:33:19,155 --> 00:33:23,785
Here's to that no-trouble trip
through the Union lines.

350
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:30,595
What part of home are you from?

351
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:38,720
The only thing we've got in common
is that we bleed if we're cut.

352
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:41,077
I'm in this for money.

353
00:33:41,112 --> 00:33:43,360
How much?
- 2,000, gold.

354
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:46,460
That's what Smith promised,
cash on the line.

355
00:33:46,523 --> 00:33:48,526
Benjy?

356
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:53,660
Give him 300 in gold.

357
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:55,680
2,000 is the price.

358
00:33:55,715 --> 00:34:00,402
300 now and 1,000 when
we're inside the Confederate lines.

359
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:03,660
You can't get through
Indian territory without me.

360
00:34:03,718 --> 00:34:05,720
Maybe not but we can try.

361
00:34:09,795 --> 00:34:11,797
It's a deal.

362
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,888
Number 22, black.

363
00:34:40,515 --> 00:34:43,860
Easy come, easy go, with our money.
He hasn't won a hand.

364
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:47,364
The faster he loses,
the quicker he'll go.

365
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,368
That won't be long.

366
00:34:55,445 --> 00:34:57,481
Aces, a pair.

367
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:05,765
He's got the manners of a pig.

368
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:11,677
Here comes Christopher Columbus...
and the sheriff.

369
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:23,360
Gentlemen.
- What are you gonna sing?

370
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,330
Give us a song!

371
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:29,723
Gentlemen, please.
- Sing nice and loud, we'll chime in.

372
00:35:29,758 --> 00:35:34,040
I have an announcement.
In cooperation with the army

373
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:39,570
from now on, any vehicle leaving
Baxter Springs will be searched.

374
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:41,360
What're you looking for?

375
00:35:41,396 --> 00:35:43,850
When we find it, you'll know.

376
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:46,490
That fixes it.
- We must move fast.

377
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:47,960
Can you handle things
at the Curtis house?

378
00:35:48,004 --> 00:35:48,860
Leave it to me.

379
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,133
I'll keep an eye on Manning.

380
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:10,961
Miss, would you... Do you have
anything for stomach poisoning?

381
00:36:11,845 --> 00:36:15,167
It's very late.
- Anything! Please! Please!

382
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:20,690
Come in.
I didn't mean to turn you away.

383
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:25,606
You're very kind.
- I'm leaving early in the morning.

384
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,160
I understand. Never mind...

385
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:29,575
Nonsense. You come right in.

386
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:32,127
You sit down here.

387
00:36:32,445 --> 00:36:37,007
That's it. I'll get something
from the hospital room.

388
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,960
We'll pump your stomach
and you'll feel better.

389
00:36:58,014 --> 00:37:01,610
NO!
That never helps a case like mine!

390
00:37:01,645 --> 00:37:04,460
Don't be alarmed.
It's practically painless.

391
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:06,560
I don't mind the pain.

392
00:37:06,635 --> 00:37:09,810
Two doctors
tried the same thing.

393
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:14,134
They didn't get any place.
Exactly the same thing!

394
00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:17,130
I have a special-type stomach.

395
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:19,087
Really?
- It's the way I'm formed.

396
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:21,010
Do you get these attacks often?

397
00:37:21,011 --> 00:37:26,325
Four times a year. The only thing
that helps is kummel tea.

398
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,435
Kummel tea?
- It's a German special...

399
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,110
It's an old remedy for stomachache.
- Yeah.

400
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:35,256
You sit quietly
and I'll brew some right away.

401
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:20,610
Where's your partner?

402
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:22,685
In the saloon.

403
00:38:27,885 --> 00:38:31,560
The water'll be boiled
in a moment. You look better.

404
00:38:31,582 --> 00:38:34,734
Being in a warm house always helps.

405
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:37,110
Does Mr Farraday know you're sick?

406
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:41,189
When Jim gambles,
he doesn't like to be bothered.

407
00:38:41,224 --> 00:38:43,228
Fine friend!

408
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,868
He's not so bad.
He gambles to forget his troubles.

409
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:50,610
What kind of troubles?

410
00:38:50,623 --> 00:38:55,311
One thing and another.
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

411
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,991
That's it. Genuine kummel tea.

412
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:02,621
My grandmother said
good kummel tea will cure anything.

413
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,079
I'll show you
how she used to make it.

414
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,560
Was he in trouble
with police back East?

415
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:16,060
Except when it comes to gambling
and women, Jim's law-abiding.

416
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,078
Now,
if you'll bring some cups please.

417
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,830
Why can't you talk about it?

418
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:46,760
About what?

419
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:48,960
Mr Farraday's troubles.

420
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,826
I gave my sacred word
to him and his...

421
00:39:52,861 --> 00:39:54,833
I gave my word.

422
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,635
One teaspoonful for flavouring.

423
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:02,471
My grandmother, may she
rest in peace, said one teaspoon.

424
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:04,472
No more, no less.

425
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:11,156
It must be shameful if you were
sworn to secrecy by him and his...

426
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:14,597
Who was it?
- I promised not to talk about that.

427
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,190
You understand my position?

428
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,261
Naturally.

429
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,263
I can feel that kummel taking hold.

430
00:40:28,298 --> 00:40:31,075
Can I boil up another batch?

431
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:35,342
It can take a couple of pots
to come back to myself.

432
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,560
I could use another 300.

433
00:41:31,566 --> 00:41:36,550
We have a contract, and that's that.
1,000 more and we're through.

434
00:41:36,585 --> 00:41:38,610
I'm ready when you are.

435
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:41,351
Pretty soon now. I'll let you know.

436
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,082
I know who that other person is.

437
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,960
A girl.

438
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:03,161
I... I promised.

439
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:10,898
Benjamin, who took care of you when
you were sick - Mr Farraday or me?

440
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:14,403
You did.

441
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:20,321
Either we are friends
or we are not friends.

442
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:22,436
We are friends.

443
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,151
Then tell me.

444
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,710
It won't go outside of this room.
You have my word.

445
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,123
Your sacred word?

446
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,540
My sacred word.

447
00:42:37,575 --> 00:42:39,560
You were right.

448
00:42:39,592 --> 00:42:40,460
A girl?

449
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:42,562
Two.

450
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,714
Was it... in Boston?

451
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,123
And New York.

452
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,380
Where else?

453
00:42:59,415 --> 00:43:00,960
Chicago.

454
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:01,760
And?

455
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:05,911
Milwaukee.
That's why Jim wants to leave here.

456
00:43:05,946 --> 00:43:06,960
Why?

457
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:10,483
He says there aren't enough girls here.

458
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:33,607
Hey, listen...! Don't...!
Give me the gun. No!

459
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,373
What's wrong?

460
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:05,363
It's all right.

461
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,966
Just target practice.

462
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,602
Oh, well...

463
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,485
Is she asleep?

464
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,960
Unconscious.
She's being put to bed.

465
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,641
When is she leaving town?
- Very early tomorrow.

466
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,408
What's this?
- Target practice.

467
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,851
She could outshoot the Union army
but she drinks like a Yankee.

468
00:45:06,886 --> 00:45:10,325
Passes out
on one pot of Grandma's tea!

469
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:14,456
Nora's taking these boxes for us
but don't tell her.

470
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:17,960
The hospital wagon -
why didn't I think of that?

471
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:19,860
You were too busy.

472
00:45:19,923 --> 00:45:23,485
She only got drunk because of you.

473
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,260
My being a conscientious objector?

474
00:45:27,289 --> 00:45:28,960
Your reputation with women.

475
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:31,362
Thanks, friend!

476
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,860
I hope they don't search too hard.

477
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:44,880
They're used to this wagon.
They won't bother.

478
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,760
And if they do?

479
00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:49,175
We shoot our way through.

480
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:55,376
You and Manning pick it up at the ford.
I'll meet you there at daybreak.

481
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:57,110
Where will I find Manning?

482
00:45:57,134 --> 00:45:59,405
The livery stable.

483
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,460
I don't like dealing with him.

484
00:46:01,522 --> 00:46:06,565
If he can run horses out,
he'll be able to get us through.

485
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:12,525
Here, you'd better hold on to
the bankroll. No sense trusting him.

486
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,691
Watch him. With Manning, you shoot
first and discuss the reasons later.

487
00:46:36,278 --> 00:46:38,542
Yes... Yes...

488
00:46:38,577 --> 00:46:40,807
Breakfast!

489
00:46:45,638 --> 00:46:47,643
Well...

490
00:46:47,678 --> 00:46:50,602
# Cos it builds you up
and it cures your ills

491
00:46:50,637 --> 00:46:53,795
# One bottle's worth
a million pills #

492
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,848
How about a pick-you-up?
- Oh...

493
00:46:57,038 --> 00:46:59,003
Oh...

494
00:46:59,038 --> 00:47:01,260
Wh-Wh-When did you get here?

495
00:47:01,324 --> 00:47:04,603
Last night. Ready for breakfast?

496
00:47:04,638 --> 00:47:08,642
Coffee, bread and honey -
just what you ordered.

497
00:47:10,158 --> 00:47:11,460
I... ordered?

498
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:13,443
Why, yes.

499
00:47:13,478 --> 00:47:16,800
Is B-B-Benjy downstairs?

500
00:47:17,038 --> 00:47:21,600
Why, no, he left last night
when you told him to go. Honey?

501
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:24,925
I told him to go?

502
00:47:25,158 --> 00:47:29,162
There was no sense in us both
taking care of you.

503
00:47:29,197 --> 00:47:32,127
But...!
- Cream?

504
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,323
Sugar?

505
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:38,724
One or two? Two.

506
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:43,295
Oh, don't you feel well?

507
00:47:45,078 --> 00:47:49,526
I... I'll be all right.
Will you please go?

508
00:47:49,768 --> 00:47:54,205
Isn't there something
I can do for you? A wet towel?

509
00:47:54,398 --> 00:47:57,777
You'll call me
if you change your mind?

510
00:48:11,328 --> 00:48:15,799
That was the nightgown you wanted
to wear, wasn't it?

511
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:26,644
All right, move on!

512
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:33,889
Have a good trip, Nora.

513
00:48:36,158 --> 00:48:37,460
What do you want?

514
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:41,164
We're searching everything
going out of town.

515
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,977
You'd do better
stopping riffraff from coming in.

516
00:48:46,012 --> 00:48:47,910
Don't mess up my things!

517
00:48:47,936 --> 00:48:49,404
They'll be careful.

518
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:53,418
Now you woke the baby!

519
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:57,884
I'm sorry.
OK, boys. Miss Curtis can go on.

520
00:48:58,118 --> 00:49:00,177
Thank you.

521
00:49:01,568 --> 00:49:03,559
Giddy up! Get up!

522
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:10,087
What is this?
What are you doing...?

523
00:50:13,728 --> 00:50:16,299
Get in the back and shut up!

524
00:50:16,568 --> 00:50:18,210
Move!
- Keep your hands off her!

525
00:50:18,217 --> 00:50:21,875
I'm afraid
I'm no Southern gentleman.

526
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:25,534
That's certain.
We'll pull up over there.

527
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:29,319
Come on!

528
00:50:42,528 --> 00:50:45,179
Nobody's gonna hurt you, missy.

529
00:50:45,928 --> 00:50:50,763
I'm sorry you got mixed up in this
but there was no option.

530
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:55,252
Jim'll join us, we'll take
these boxes and that's it.

531
00:50:55,287 --> 00:50:57,250
What's in those boxes?

532
00:50:58,448 --> 00:51:02,293
Well, it's a...
kind of a muscle-building.

533
00:51:02,528 --> 00:51:05,099
You're the men Kelso was after.

534
00:51:08,968 --> 00:51:13,132
You're thieving spies,
you and... Jim Farraday!

535
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:20,250
In the Confederate States of America,
they call us patriots.

536
00:51:20,647 --> 00:51:22,729
Miss?

537
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:41,330
We'll need more cover.
There, down by the river.

538
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:43,807
Yes, sir, colonel, sir!

539
00:52:02,527 --> 00:52:08,341
You sleep in the wagon. You'll be
more comfortable. I'll start supper.

540
00:52:08,577 --> 00:52:13,332
Now, look, miss, please
stop worrying. There's no need.

541
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:16,933
You'll be safe here.
You've got my word.

542
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:19,160
Why not your sacred word?

543
00:52:19,213 --> 00:52:21,216
Yes, ma'am.

544
00:52:24,487 --> 00:52:26,301
Water those horses.

545
00:52:26,336 --> 00:52:28,116
We're not stopping.

546
00:52:28,136 --> 00:52:31,110
We're meeting
Farraday here tomorrow.

547
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,450
I got other plans.

548
00:52:36,217 --> 00:52:40,760
If you want that thousand, you'll
have to wait. He's got the money.

549
00:52:40,813 --> 00:52:42,827
Huh!

550
00:52:50,577 --> 00:52:53,569
You wait for him, colonel, sir!

551
00:53:05,737 --> 00:53:07,773
Hah! Hah!

552
00:53:31,597 --> 00:53:34,077
Keep your eyes on the trail.

553
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:42,562
You're alive only because that squaw
comes from Yellow Hawk's village.

554
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:46,118
The squaw and the kid
are your life insurance.

555
00:53:48,477 --> 00:53:51,260
I trade with Yellow Hawk.
She needn't worry.

556
00:53:51,355 --> 00:53:54,040
The South must be proud of you!

557
00:53:54,277 --> 00:53:56,598
The trail's that way.

558
00:54:03,877 --> 00:54:05,415
Clean as a whistle.

559
00:54:05,435 --> 00:54:07,910
You leave things how you found them.

560
00:54:07,927 --> 00:54:10,042
They'll tend to it.

561
00:54:10,077 --> 00:54:11,560
You coming back here, Mr Farraday?

562
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:13,910
Might. It's a good business town.

563
00:54:13,922 --> 00:54:17,438
As good as they come, and growing.

564
00:54:17,473 --> 00:54:18,710
Where are you heading?

565
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,160
I'm meeting my partner at Lawrence.

566
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:26,197
Huh! You'll see the difference!
Lawrence is dead compared to here.

567
00:54:26,232 --> 00:54:27,510
All done.
- OK.

568
00:54:27,528 --> 00:54:29,598
Thank you.

569
00:54:29,837 --> 00:54:31,885
Get up!

570
00:54:36,957 --> 00:54:39,687
We'll be with Kelso if you need us.

571
00:55:03,397 --> 00:55:05,910
Is Mr Kelso there?
There's a message for him.

572
00:55:05,922 --> 00:55:07,310
I'll give it to him.

573
00:55:07,322 --> 00:55:09,723
Sorry, it's confidential.

574
00:55:09,758 --> 00:55:11,719
Come in.

575
00:55:15,037 --> 00:55:17,002
For you.

576
00:55:17,037 --> 00:55:23,660
Some big news, too.
Richmond and Petersburg were evacuated.
General Lee's army is in retreat.

577
00:55:23,727 --> 00:55:26,719
Say, that's great news. Do you...?

578
00:55:28,517 --> 00:55:35,719
"Research show James Farraday was
a Union army major killed in action
two years ago."

579
00:55:35,754 --> 00:55:40,404
"Suggest your man assumed
this identity for own purposes."

580
00:55:40,439 --> 00:55:42,160
Let's pick up Jim Farraday.

581
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:45,528
Wait a minute. Farraday left town.

582
00:55:45,757 --> 00:55:51,218
How was I to know you wanted him?
You never said anything.

583
00:55:51,447 --> 00:55:52,410
When did he go?

584
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:54,926
Oh, four... no, five hours ago.

585
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:57,404
You searched his wagon?
- Yes.

586
00:55:57,517 --> 00:56:00,800
He said he was off to Lawrence.
- We'll get him there.

587
00:56:00,807 --> 00:56:03,117
He isn't going to Lawrence.

588
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:04,910
Can you track a wagon?

589
00:56:04,937 --> 00:56:06,510
Yes, but not at night.

590
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,443
I want 12 men to go with us at dawn.

591
00:56:09,478 --> 00:56:11,610
I'll have them.

592
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,560
Nothing much besides bottles.

593
00:58:15,648 --> 00:58:19,060
Someone should take it
back to Baxter Springs.

594
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:21,052
Ross!

595
00:58:59,687 --> 00:59:02,815
Next time it'll be your face.

596
00:59:19,737 --> 00:59:26,586
The other wagon was here first.
A single horse, probably Farraday's,
took after the wagon.

597
00:59:26,621 --> 00:59:28,460
How long ago? Can you tell?

598
00:59:28,488 --> 00:59:30,934
No, but I can follow it.

599
01:00:02,417 --> 01:00:04,812
It's called a Gatling gun.

600
01:00:04,847 --> 01:00:10,820
Tell your men it fires 250 bullets
a minute, fast as rain from the sky.

601
01:00:19,207 --> 01:00:24,338
I have told them. Now let the gun
say that you have earned the price.

602
01:00:24,577 --> 01:00:28,183
Tell them to hang on
to their war bonnets.

603
01:00:32,297 --> 01:00:34,413
Watch those!

604
01:00:53,457 --> 01:00:55,448
Look.

605
01:00:58,377 --> 01:01:00,823
One of your own rifle bullets.

606
01:01:03,537 --> 01:01:10,067
It fits this gun.
This gun is worth ten tribes.
They'll all fear Yellow Hawk.

607
01:01:10,102 --> 01:01:11,560
Unless they too get such guns.

608
01:01:11,581 --> 01:01:15,560
They can't. Only four exist -
this is the only one in the West.

609
01:01:24,617 --> 01:01:26,110
We march against Fort Smith.

610
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,142
Good hunting.

611
01:01:28,177 --> 01:01:33,979
Six more bag of gold - 4,000
gold dollar - if you march with us.

612
01:01:34,014 --> 01:01:37,222
It's not my war, not for just 4, 000.

613
01:01:37,257 --> 01:01:42,388
Inside Fort Smith there is much more
It is yours if you shoot the gun.

614
01:01:42,617 --> 01:01:43,960
How do you know what's inside?

615
01:01:43,982 --> 01:01:46,303
My scouts have seen it.

616
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:51,793
With the fort's ammunition and
this gun, many tribes will join us.

617
01:01:51,828 --> 01:01:54,660
Even with a gun, you need more men.

618
01:01:54,699 --> 01:01:59,740
We have friends in other villages
- Yogalan, Taminiconju, Hiosake.

619
01:01:59,977 --> 01:02:02,457
They will come when we call.

620
01:02:05,497 --> 01:02:09,024
If I join you,
it's for one attack only.

621
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,019
I agree.

622
01:02:12,177 --> 01:02:15,160
And an escort out the territory
when it's over.

623
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,960
I agree.

624
01:02:16,978 --> 01:02:19,515
It's a deal. When do we march?

625
01:02:21,457 --> 01:02:23,459
Sunrise.

626
01:03:02,547 --> 01:03:05,300
Smoke signal over the ridge, sir.

627
01:03:49,177 --> 01:03:51,953
Go to sleep now. No more crying.

628
01:04:04,387 --> 01:04:08,460
We'll fight the war once we get out
of here. Where's Manning?

629
01:04:08,505 --> 01:04:13,796
Gone. This morning, with the gun.
They're going to attack Fort Smith.

630
01:04:13,831 --> 01:04:15,160
Come on, come on.

631
01:04:15,197 --> 01:04:17,348
Just a minute.

632
01:05:00,387 --> 01:05:01,860
That way to Fort Smith.

633
01:05:01,877 --> 01:05:07,418
We're not going there. I'll drop you
off home, then I'm going home myself.

634
01:05:07,453 --> 01:05:08,960
But we have to warn them.

635
01:05:09,016 --> 01:05:12,097
I'm not concerned about Fort Smith.

636
01:05:12,132 --> 01:05:15,510
But you're concerned about the gun,
and Brett Manning.

637
01:05:15,533 --> 01:05:20,699
I'll catch up with him some time.
That's one thing I'm sure of.

638
01:05:24,692 --> 01:05:27,297
You won't consider a truce-talk?

639
01:05:27,332 --> 01:05:30,310
Not when you'd let the men
at the fort die.

640
01:05:30,335 --> 01:05:31,210
Nothing I can do.

641
01:05:31,257 --> 01:05:33,297
You can warn them.

642
01:05:33,332 --> 01:05:36,210
Where I come from,
saving Yankees isn't very noble.

643
01:05:36,256 --> 01:05:40,340
Can't you think of them
just as people?

644
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:43,377
I could, but it wouldn't be easy.

645
01:05:43,412 --> 01:05:47,497
The same people burned my home
and killed my brother.

646
01:05:47,532 --> 01:05:52,538
And, you know, if I made that noble
gesture you keep harping on...

647
01:05:52,772 --> 01:05:54,854
...they'd shoot me for a spy.

648
01:05:56,812 --> 01:06:01,499
I guess you're right.
In a war, you have to take sides.

649
01:06:01,732 --> 01:06:10,151
And four years of war are more than
enough to learn how to hate good
and hard. You said that, remember?

650
01:06:25,373 --> 01:06:32,939
There aren't really many differences
between us. Some day
when we know each other better...

651
01:06:33,933 --> 01:06:36,094
Some day... maybe.

652
01:06:41,973 --> 01:06:44,305
Time to turn in.

653
01:06:47,853 --> 01:06:53,109
Just like you Yankees - you want
all the territory for yourselves.

654
01:06:57,333 --> 01:07:01,861
Mason-Dixon Line -
and see that you don't cross it.

655
01:08:03,023 --> 01:08:05,309
Get up! Slowly!

656
01:08:05,533 --> 01:08:10,068
Go on, pick it up. The best kind
of rebels are dead ones.

657
01:08:10,103 --> 01:08:14,160
Mr Kelso and I have the same
philosophy but different viewpoints.

658
01:08:14,187 --> 01:08:15,260
Where's that gun?

659
01:08:15,268 --> 01:08:17,908
He just searched me, didn't he?

660
01:08:17,943 --> 01:08:22,510
Manning sold it to Yellow Hawk.
They're advancing on Fort Smith.

661
01:08:22,551 --> 01:08:25,108
If we hurry, we may make it.

662
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:29,500
Thomas, alert the Lawrence garrison.
The fort'll need help.

663
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:34,892
You should send Miss Curtis back with
them so she won't see the bloodshed.

664
01:08:34,927 --> 01:08:38,960
It'll be like Atlanta when you brave
Yankee soldiers burnt us out!

665
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:44,388
The fort isn't all Yankee soldiers.
Their families are with them.

666
01:11:00,898 --> 01:11:04,273
They've got some kind
of rapid-fire gun.

667
01:11:04,308 --> 01:11:08,160
I've heard about such a gun.
It will wipe us out.

668
01:11:08,199 --> 01:11:12,238
We can't locate it.
We need to send out a patrol.

669
01:11:12,273 --> 01:11:14,822
Send out 12 men.
- Yes, sir.

670
01:11:15,068 --> 01:11:17,510
Go up the tower.
Report all activity to me.

671
01:11:17,548 --> 01:11:19,550
Yes, sir.

672
01:11:50,588 --> 01:11:52,829
The fort is just over that rise.

673
01:11:55,308 --> 01:11:56,610
That's the Gatling gun.

674
01:11:56,639 --> 01:11:59,631
Mr Kelso, give me Mr Farraday's gun.

675
01:12:03,418 --> 01:12:05,909
Keep your men out of sight.

676
01:13:29,508 --> 01:13:32,473
Fort can't last much longer.

677
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:35,060
I need one man with me.
We have to knock out that gun.

678
01:13:35,124 --> 01:13:37,513
I'm ready when you are.

679
01:13:37,548 --> 01:13:43,999
We'll use knives if we reach Manning.
If we stop him, we stop the gun.

680
01:13:44,228 --> 01:13:46,910
He's probably the only one
who can operate it.

681
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:49,283
He may not be the only one.

682
01:13:49,318 --> 01:13:51,960
What about your leg? Any of the men
will take your place...

683
01:13:51,991 --> 01:13:58,397
I'll be OK. We'll go up on opposite
flanks. The rocks protect the gun.

684
01:13:58,628 --> 01:14:03,060
Deploy the men behind that ridge.
No noise - we only have one chance.

685
01:14:03,122 --> 01:14:05,139
Yes, sir.

686
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:07,156
Take cover.

687
01:14:46,358 --> 01:14:48,508
More of them.

688
01:14:48,748 --> 01:14:57,679
Colonel, more smoke signals!
Two new tribes have joined Yellow Hawk.
Maybe 1,000, maybe more.

689
01:15:16,828 --> 01:15:20,446
Colonel Stagg!
Signals from Major Dawson.

690
01:15:20,678 --> 01:15:23,110
He's on Ridge Hill.
- Signal him to await orders.

691
01:15:23,158 --> 01:15:25,331
Yes, sir.

692
01:16:34,768 --> 01:16:39,444
No, you can't shoot.
No noise, those were the orders.

693
01:18:27,128 --> 01:18:29,699
Signal Major Dawson to attack!

694
01:20:56,828 --> 01:21:02,368
I guess I can deliver it
to the arsenal in Indianapolis now.

695
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:04,710
Where are you from, Mr...?

696
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:07,625
James Simmons, Georgia Volunteers.

697
01:21:09,208 --> 01:21:13,304
That train robbery was a nice job -
good timing.

698
01:21:14,538 --> 01:21:18,413
Sergeant, let's move this gun
inside the fort.

699
01:21:18,448 --> 01:21:22,660
Mr Kelso, I hope you'll take
into consideration what Jim did...

700
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:27,103
I... never liked being judge
orjury, Miss Curtis.

701
01:21:27,138 --> 01:21:35,341
Richmond and Petersburg have fallen.
Lee's army is in full retreat.
It's a matter of days now.

702
01:21:35,578 --> 01:21:40,129
What happens to you will be
up to the military court...

703
01:21:40,164 --> 01:21:43,143
...if you're around when they meet.

704
01:22:04,058 --> 01:22:06,103
Jim...

705
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:07,710
Do you have any plans?

706
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:11,860
I'll go home, fix up the old place.
Travel maybe - west, I guess.

707
01:22:11,906 --> 01:22:14,455
Anywhere near Baxter Springs?

708
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:16,560
My first stop.

709
01:22:16,584 --> 01:22:22,216
That different point of view again.
I plan to make it your last stop.

710
01:22:22,251 --> 01:22:24,745
Next to last. You'll like Atlanta.
