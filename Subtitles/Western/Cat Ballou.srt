Fully equipped
to deal with the
misery, unhappiness

63
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:25,449
And stupidity
on every hand.

64

I taught you.

looks clean, at least.

This here man
is in my custody,

67
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,890

nobody near him.

Oh, Catherine!

74
00:05:56,142 --> 00:06:00,110
You were a good student,
and I know you'll be
a good teacher.

75
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:01,311
I have to go.

76
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:03,579
Oh, Mrs. Parker.

77
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:04,245
All aboard.

78
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:07,181
Goodbye, darling.
Be a good girl.

(chuckles)

82
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,605
Miss Parker
didn't introduce us.
I'm Catherine Ballou.

83
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:38,842
I'm drunk as a skunk.

84
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,813
I apologize for being in
this disgusting condition.

85
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:48,883
I assure you,
I'll not inflict myself
on you further.

86
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,488
First time in my life
I ever drank.

87
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,425
I took the pledge
of the A's A at the big
temperance meeting

88
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:01,527
In Gratzburg, Montana.

89
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,562
You remember that?

90
00:07:03,564 --> 00:07:08,166
Oh, it was a great
outpouring of the spirit,

91
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:12,369
And I'll not inflict
myself on you any further.

92
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:14,137
Thank you.

93
00:07:18,643 --> 00:07:19,575
Tennyson.

94
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:23,111
Spins a good yarn,
does he, Tennyson?

95
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:25,245
He's a great poet!

96
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:26,579
Poet?

97
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:28,113
May I?

98
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:32,884
"I stepped out of the dark
barroom into the street

99
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,353

"come on out, Kid Shelleen.

101
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:44,394
"I'm gonna blow you
clear out of Tombstone
and into hell.""

102
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:48,764
Tennyson's a good poet.

103
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:56,070
"Kid Shelleen
and the massacre
at Whiskey Slide."

104
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:02,876
Ma'am, I apologize for
my disgusting condition.

105
00:08:02,878 --> 00:08:08,314
And I assure you,
I will not inflict myself
on you any further.

106
00:08:08,316 --> 00:08:10,182
I wish there was
something I could do.

107
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:15,654
You're very kind,
but I got here all
the help he'll need.

108
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,288
That's very true.

109
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,024
There are good
things in the bible
for a time like this.

110
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:21,058
Oh, ain't there.

111
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,426
This berth next,
young lady.

112
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:24,828
If you'll just step
into the aisle.

113
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,097
Excuse me, ma'am.
Sorry!

114
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:35,870
I reckon I won't
never see you no more.

115
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:38,272
It's been a pleasure
knowing you.

116
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:40,607
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

117
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,052
Yeah?

118
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:57,188
Hallelujah, brother!

119
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,256
I'm here to
comfort the sinner

120
00:08:59,258 --> 00:09:01,791
And return the stray
lamb to the fold.

121
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:05,294
Let him who's troubled...
You got a match?

122
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:12,768
Go on.

123
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,436
Eh...

124
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:15,970
Hallelujah, brother!

125
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,972
I'm here to
comfort the sinner

126
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,908
And return the stray
lamb to the fold.

127

Let him who's
troubled, let him...

128
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,278
Thanks.

129
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:28,680
You're welcome.
You was saying?

130
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:30,547
Eh, uh...

131
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:32,448
Hallelujah, brother!

132
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,518
I am here to comfort
the sinner and, and...

133
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,019
And all like that.

134
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:40,688
Now just a
minute, pilgrim.

135
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,829
All right.
Come on in.

136
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:53,999
My poor fellow,

137
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:57,902
Are there any particular
verses you'd like to hear?

138
00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:58,369
Ha!

139
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:01,338
Told you. He's about
as religious as a hog.

140
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,608
There's bound to be
something in here
that can help him.

141
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:09,511
Keep every Sheriff
easy, move. Eh, uh...

142
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:11,646
Hands over your head.

143
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:21,421
Sure glad to see
you, Uncle Jed.
Likewise.

144
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:23,756
Keep him
covered now.
Yeah.

145
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:25,257
Open wide.

146
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,326
All right. Come on now!
Handcuff him to the pipe.

147
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,627
Yeah.

148
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,435
Hit him! Hit him!

149
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,404
Will you hit him?

150
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:44,506
Hold him!
I'll hit him!

151
00:10:44,508 --> 00:10:46,407
(grunting)

152
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:51,044
Pick up the stuff.
I'll cuff him to the pipe.

153
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:58,250
Come on!

154
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:09,527
Let me have one
of them guns.

155
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:12,329
Didn't you take his?
Didn't you?

156
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:14,898
I'm worried he's gonna
blast himself free.

157
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,933
Go ahead, jump!

158
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:21,237
Jump?

159
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,473
Jump!

160
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,713
(gunshot)

161
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:37,951
What happened?

162
00:11:37,953 --> 00:11:40,286
He freed my prisoner.
Who did?

163
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:42,254
That bible-thumper that
was sitting with the girl.

164
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:44,756
Conductor: You mean that
young lady in lower five?

165
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:46,224
Sheriff: Yeah, that's her!

166
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:47,758
(whispers)
please.

167
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,425
Right here.

168
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:50,794
Sheriff: Hey, you in there.
Hey, girl!

169
00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:51,694
Conductor:
Come on, miss, wake up!

170
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:55,330
The Sheriff wants
to talk to you. Come on.
Wake up, wake up.

171
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,799
Parson you was sitting with.
Where he go? Did you see him?

172
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,600
And my prisoner?

173
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:03,369
Maybe he's in the
next car. Come on!

174
00:12:05,406 --> 00:12:07,806
Oh, I shouldn't
have done that.

175
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:09,874
Oh, sure you
should, honey.

176
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:13,043
No question about it
in my mind at all.

177
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:15,545
It was morally wrong.

178
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,614
But it happened so fast,
I didn't know what to think.

179
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:21,248
I... I was afraid
he'd hurt you.

180
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,283
That's right,
that's right.

181
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,185
You know, he'd have
blowed my head off.

182
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:27,920
(sniffing)
what are you doing?

183
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:32,324
Oh, I got a
catarrhal condition.

184
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:35,460
Well, you're too close.
Scrootch back.

185
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:40,164
Oh, don't think
I was offering
unwelcome advances.

186
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,933
I put women on
a pedestal. I do.

187
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:44,234
Further.

188
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:46,669
I'm smack up against
the side right now.

189
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:48,671
It's gonna get
mighty uncomfortable.

190
00:12:48,673 --> 00:12:50,973
Well, you're not
gonna be in here
long enough for that.

191
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:53,508
You gotta get out
of here the moment
it's safe.

192
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,942
Well, that's what
I'm anxious to do.

193
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:58,779
You think I'd care
to stay any longer
than needed?

194
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:03,817
Ooh! There are still
people out there.

195
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,019
Darn!

196
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:08,688
I guess I'll just have
to stay put, then.

197
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,757
Even though it goes
against my very grain.

198
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,359
You take your arm
away this second.

199
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:14,959
Hmm? Oh.

200
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,828
Listen, I am supposed
to be a school teacher.

201
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,362
I'll scream!

202
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:20,830
Hey!

203
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:26,201
I was only gonna see
if the coast is clear.

204
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:34,208
Gents out there
with shotguns.

205
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,277
Oh, what are we gonna do?
You can't stay here.

206
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,046
Oh, lordy,
I hate shotguns.
Don't you?

207
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:43,516
I mean, they leave
such an oozy corpse.

208
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:46,385
But there's one chance
in a 100 I can make it.

209
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:49,121
I'm gonna take that
chance for your sake.

210
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:51,056
You being a school
teacher and all.

211
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:53,558
No, wait!
No, no, no.

212
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,495
I'd rather get cut down
in the prime of my
young manhood

213
00:13:57,497 --> 00:14:01,532
Than risk compromising
a nice girl like you.

214
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:05,668
Here. If they
get me, though,

215
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,471
I want you should have
my watch and chain.

216
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,006
Oh, this is awful!

217
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:15,409
Ain't it, though?

218
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:16,776
You get away!

219
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:19,745
Well, I just gotta watch
what's going on, don't i?

220
00:14:19,747 --> 00:14:22,681
I'll do the watching.
You get away.

221
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:28,853
I thought you were lyin'.

222
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:31,154
You mean, I wasn't?

223
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:35,023
All right,
let's get this one.

224
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:41,929
They're searching
the berths.

225
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,500
What's your name
so's I can vote for
you next election?

226
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:48,968
Catherine Ballou.

227
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,536
Mine's Clay Boone.

228
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:53,272
Goodbye, Miss Ballou.

229
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,976
Yeah-hoo!

253
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:11,637
Cat: Papa, what happened?

254
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,372
That corral used
to be full of horses.

255
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:15,040
Frankie: Well, I got
tired of them horses.

256
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:18,510
I sold them all off to the
Army at Fort Huckabee,
and good luck to 'em.

257
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:21,579
But, papa, you spent
as much time raisin'
those horses

258
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,314
As you did raisin' me.

259
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,782
Ah!

260
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,784
And the house!
You haven't had that
painted since I left.

261
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:33,656
Well, I like it that way,
all gray and weathered
and full of splinters.

262
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:34,923
Cat: Papa!

263
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:36,925
Come on, honey.

264
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:42,630
Well, this here's
my new bronc-buster.

265
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:44,665
This is my daughter,
Catherine.

266
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,033
<i>Shalom aleichem,</i>
Jackson Two-Bears.

267
00:16:46,035 --> 00:16:49,703
Mr. Ballou, what's
the use of saying
<i>shalom aleichem</i> to me?

268
00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:51,171
I'm a full
Sioux Indian!

269
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:52,405
I'm not one of the
chosen people.

270
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:54,807
All right, go ahead
being stubborn if you wanna.

271
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:56,942
I ain't stubborn.
Oh, not much, you ain't!

272
00:16:56,944 --> 00:16:59,010
You know, according
to an ex-congressman
of these United States

273
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:02,246
I heard give
a lecture at the
Chautauqua this winter,

274
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:06,350
Indians is the
lost tribe of Israel,
but he won't admit it.

275
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:07,084
Just ain't true!

276
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:10,720
He was an ex-congressman
of these United States,
I tell ya.

277
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:12,521
But, papa, maybe
he was mistaken.

278
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:13,755
Oh, no, he was not.

279
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:17,558
Jackson's just got
a mean, stubborn
streak in him, is all.

280
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,727
I brought Mr. Bernstein,
the telegraph operator,

281
00:17:20,729 --> 00:17:22,428
Out here from
town last month,

282
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,797
And he stood right
where you're standin' now,

283
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,100
And he talked Hebrew
at Jackson for 10
minutes by my watch.

284
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:31,970
And Jackson
pretended he didn't
understand a word.

285
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:33,538
Now, I call
that stubborn.

286
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,040
Well, I didn't
understand a word.

287
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:37,508
You see what I mean?

288
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,012
Now, you get that trunk
down out of there.
I'll get the satchel.

289
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,720
Jackson. What's happening?

290
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,125
Your old man's got
some roughshod ways.

291
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:58,527
He's rubbed a lot of people
the wrong way around here.

292
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:01,363
But he's a sweet old bear.
He wouldn't hurt anybody.

293
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:03,064
Why, don't you think
I know that?

294
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,266
Why, nobody in this whole
county would give me a job.

295
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:09,470
As though I was responsible
for what my people done
to General Custer.

296
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:12,773
I swear, I was a little
baby at the time.

297
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,107
But your daddy,

298
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:17,877
Well, he gave me
a job right off.

299
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:19,077
Full wages too.

300
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:23,915
I guess I respect
and admire him more
than I ever done anybody.

301
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:24,949
Then tell me
why, Jackson.

302
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:26,884
This used to be
the best spread
in the whole valley.

303
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:31,555
Well, the town's got
a big outfit moving in,
to build factories.

304
00:18:31,557 --> 00:18:34,457
Make a real city
of Wolf City.

305
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:37,159
They want your
daddy's water rights.

306
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:37,826
He won't sell them.

307
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:40,495
I'm gonna build us lunch,
catherine, soon as we get
this trunk inside.

308
00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:43,831
Papa, I'm gonna
do the cookin'
now that I'm home.

309
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,233
I'm gonna take care of you.

310
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:49,835
(screams)

311
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,909
Frankie Ballou?

312
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,178
Beat it, you.

313
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:20,362
I didn't mean
to scream, but he
came out of nowhere.

314
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:23,798
And that nose!
Who is he, papa?

315
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,699
Give me a hand, Jackson.

316
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:29,969
Papa, who is he?

317
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:30,970
Jackson:
Tim Strawn, I'll bet ya.

318
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:32,805
When I say <i> shalom aleichem</i> ,
you don't know nothin'.

319
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,774
Now, suddenly,
you're a mine
of information.

320
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:36,441
Jackson, who is he?

321
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:40,278
He's a murderer,
a hired killer. His nose
was bit off in a fight.

322
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,650
If I was gonna be scared,
I'd be scared of the fella
who bit it off, not him.

323
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:46,017
Papa!

324
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,551
I can take care
of myself, Catherine.

325
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,718
I always have,
and I always will.

326
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,287
So don't let
it bother you.
It don't bother me.

327
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,423
Papa, you've gotta
do somethin' about it.

328
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,359
What we're gonna do,
Catherine, is go on living.

329
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,828
We're gonna eat,
we're gonna sleep,
and we're gonna work.

330
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:04,099
And tomorrow we're
gonna go celebrate
the fall harvest day.

331
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:07,802
Take care of the
horses, Jackson.

332
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:21,348
(music playing)

333
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,616
Mabel, ha-ha!

334
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:41,700
Hey.

335
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:42,500
Well!

336
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:45,736
Well, now,
there's a game
for a Sheriff.

337
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:47,471
Liar's poker.

338
00:20:47,473 --> 00:20:48,138
(laughs)

339
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,372
We got our unemployed
off the streets

340
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:53,109
And made Wolf City safe,
all in one brilliant stroke.

341
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:55,211
They grabbed
Ed Cardigan
for Sheriff.

342
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,046
Oh, he's good.
He's too lazy to steal

343
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,213
And too dumb...
Ballou!

344
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,148
I'll ask you to show
a little respect
for these ladies...

345
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,485
Take off your hat.
You're meetin' my
daughter, Catherine.

346
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:06,487
Well, I'll be damned.
If it ain't little...

347
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:08,922
Cardigan, you can talk
to me any way you please.

348
00:21:08,924 --> 00:21:12,959
You're talkin' to my
daughter, so watch
your damn language!

349
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:16,495
Nice to see you
back in Wolf City,
Miss Ballou.

350
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:21,900
You got any idea who
forked about a ton of
manure down my well?

351
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:23,667
Well, no.

352
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:25,869
(mocking)
well, no.

353
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:28,104
Some Sheriff.

354
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:29,972
Come on, Catherine.

355
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:33,775
Are you really a Sheriff?

356
00:21:33,777 --> 00:21:35,777
Why is it hard
to believe?

357
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:37,378
Well, why don't you help him?

358
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,647
I think someone's poisoned
that water to drive
him off his ranch.

359
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:41,381
That's what I think.

360
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,883
Yesterday, a man
named Strawn came
to the house...

361
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,416
Miss Catherine.

362
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:49,187
There are ramifications
to peace-officing that
you wouldn't understand.

363
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:50,555
Now, please believe me.

364
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:52,957
I'm taking care
of it my way.

365
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:54,858
What ramifications?

366
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,893
Don't you worry
your pretty little
head about it.

367
00:21:56,895 --> 00:22:00,196
You just go right ahead,
and have a good time.

368
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:08,670
Jackson, am I mad.

369
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:13,174
I know. I saw
you talking to
Sheriff Cardigan.

370
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:14,207
Ooh! He... (sighs)

371
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:18,778
Just like papa, he pats me
on the head and tells me
to run along.

372
00:22:20,114 --> 00:22:21,847
What am I gonna do?

373
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:24,149
They got a gunfighter.

374
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:26,618
You get a gunfighter.

375
00:22:29,923 --> 00:22:34,358
Jackson, there's a funny,
inscrutable look on your face.

376
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,793
I can't tell if you're
making fun of me or not.

377
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:42,865
Nobody'd bother your daddy
with ol' Wild Bill Hickock
or Bat Masterson around.

378
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:44,298
(whistling and cheering)

379
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,402

Come on.

You mean there really
is a Kid Shelleen?

388
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:05,647
I thought he
was just in books.

389
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:09,317
He's real, and he's one
of the best of 'em,
to my way of thinking.

390
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,051
Well, what can I do?

391
00:23:10,053 --> 00:23:13,487
Well, you can,
write him a letter.
I'll mail it.

392
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:20,994
No call to dance
with Jackson.

393
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:24,197
No call not to.
He's an Indian!

396
00:23:33,907 --> 00:23:36,974
I like Jackson.
You're just gonna make
a lot of trouble for him.

397
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:38,642

about trouble.

403
00:23:52,956 --> 00:23:56,123

Is a square dance
anything like a war dance?

This one is.

Okay.

490

We'll talk first.

491
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:25,275
Well, I can't talk with
you sitting right there
on the bed like that.

492

Well, they hate him!

497
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:35,816
And they're trying to
drive him off this ranch.

498
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:39,452
They put manure in his well,
and they've made him
talk to lawyers.

499
00:31:39,454 --> 00:31:42,855
And now they've sent a gunman
around to drive him off.

500
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:46,758
You're dreamin'.
No, he's real.
I saw him.

503
00:31:50,862 --> 00:31:53,128
A farm like this
is just dirt.

504
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,462
To him,
it's his whole life!

505
00:31:54,464 --> 00:31:58,332
Let him dig in
and fight like a man.
I'll help you pack.

506
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,601
You are absolutely useless.

yourself a gunfighter.

Don't go!

515
00:32:49,045 --> 00:32:49,777
What now?

516
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:53,247
Clay, I just don't
believe it when
you say you're...

517
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:55,682
You're useless
and cynical like that.

518
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:58,117
I mean, everybody
has to have some
good in him,

519
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:02,154
No matter how depraved
and cowardly he thinks he is.

520
00:33:02,422 --> 00:33:06,690
You know,
you are a sugarplum.

521
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:08,891
You better watch out.

522
00:33:08,893 --> 00:33:11,827
Because there are
a lot of people
that are just as

523
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:15,163
Depraved and cowardly
as they think they are.

524
00:33:15,165 --> 00:33:18,032
And one of them,
one of these days,

525
00:33:18,034 --> 00:33:21,735
Is gonna eat
you right up.

526
00:33:22,738 --> 00:33:23,403
Evening, ma'am.

527
00:33:23,405 --> 00:33:26,773
Air and moonlight
sets the bulls a-talking
to each other for sure.

528
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:27,940
What do you
want, uncle?

529
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:30,876
Well, I just
wondered if we was
staying the night.

530
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:33,411
I'd, uh, take off my boots
before going to sleep.

531
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:36,347
Jed, I helped
you on the train.
Will you help me now?

532
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:38,182
Certainly, ma'am, anything.

533
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:39,683
Stay here with us.

534
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,152
There's somebody
trying to kill my father.

535
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:44,220
No.
Jed.

536
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:44,620
Oh, Jed.

537
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:48,056
We'll stay, ma'am.
Be our pleasure
to do what we can.

538
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:50,358
We don't need him, then.

539
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,991
Oh, I think you do.

540
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:53,727
My uncle here
ain't never shot
at a man.

541
00:33:53,729 --> 00:33:56,029
It's against his principles.

542
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:56,863
Is that true?

543
00:33:56,865 --> 00:33:58,965
Oh, yes, ma'am,
that's true.

544
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:01,200
But neither has he.

545
00:34:01,202 --> 00:34:03,168
But we'll stay
and do what we can.

546
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,769
Yeah.

547
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:06,803
(sighing)

548
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:09,505

ain't no trouble.

Kid Shelleen.

572
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:48,450
Now, come on, now.
You've had a couple
hours to sleep it off.

573
00:36:48,452 --> 00:36:52,420
Let me see what
my daughter laid
out 50 bucks for.

574
00:37:03,065 --> 00:37:05,365
Well, what's
holding you up?

575
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:08,568
No gun.
All right. Go get it!

576
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:12,004
I hocked it, I think.
St. Louis?

577
00:37:12,172 --> 00:37:12,803
Frankie: Jeez!

578
00:37:12,805 --> 00:37:16,773
You mean you drank up
the whole 50 bucks
she sent you?

579
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:19,541
Fifty bucks!
Now, look what
you did to him!

580
00:37:19,543 --> 00:37:24,946
You could've killed him,
giving him 50 bucks' worth
of whiskey all at once.

581
00:37:25,048 --> 00:37:25,813
Fifty bucks!

582
00:37:25,815 --> 00:37:29,249
Papa. How was I supposed
to know he was a drunk?

583
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,326
(Clay claps)

584
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:45,430
Go on and shoot, kid.

585
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:47,932
Bang away, old fella.

586
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:07,817
You'd like a drink better
than a poke in the eye with
a sharp stob, wouldn't you?

587
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:18,393
He did it!
He missed the barn.

588
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:26,066
Sir, you know, if I could
just have one little nip
to steady my hand.

589
00:38:26,068 --> 00:38:27,567
You see, I had
the typhoid real bad.

590
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:29,635
And I had a rough
trip down here.
And if I could just...

591
00:38:29,637 --> 00:38:34,539
You know, I didn't
get no sleep. If I had
one little nip, you know.

592
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,274
Please.

593
00:38:41,748 --> 00:38:42,413
Jackson.
Yep?

594
00:38:42,415 --> 00:38:46,750
You got that bottle
you always carry to
make that Sheriff mad?

595
00:38:47,352 --> 00:38:49,151
Give him some.

596
00:39:02,366 --> 00:39:04,699
(snorting)

597
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,803
You an Indian,
ain't you?
Yeah.

598
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,539
It's all right.
I ain't got nothing
against Indians.

599
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:15,275
Yeah, they was
a breed of men
in the old west!

600
00:39:15,277 --> 00:39:19,245
It's all over for
them, just like it is
for the gunfighter.

601
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:20,879
Except they didn't
give us no reservation

602
00:39:20,881 --> 00:39:23,648
Or teach us how
to weave rugs.

603
00:39:27,587 --> 00:39:29,753
See you later, son.

604
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,089
Yeah.

605
00:39:36,227 --> 00:39:37,960
(groaning)

606
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:46,034
Yeah, it's all
over in Dodge.

607
00:39:46,036 --> 00:39:49,337
Tombstone too.
Cheyenne, Deadwood,
all gone.

608
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:51,572
All dead and gone.

609
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:53,873
Pow!

610
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,179
Why, the last time
I come through Tombstone,

611
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:04,081
The big excitement
there was about the
new roller-skatin' rink

612
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:07,084
That they'd laid out
over the O.K. Corral.

613
00:40:07,086 --> 00:40:07,951
I'll tell you something else.

614
00:40:07,953 --> 00:40:09,719
I used to work the Buffalo
Bill Wild West Show

615
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:11,120
And the Congress
of Rough Riders.

616
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:12,855
And I rescued many
a stagecoach passenger

617
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:16,725
From road agents
and drunken Indians
in the nick of time.

618
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:19,728
Twice a day.
Three times on Saturday.

619
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:25,700
(chuckles)

620
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,769
(chuckles)

621
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,476
Whoa-eh!

622
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:43,516
Where'd it go?

623
00:40:48,956 --> 00:40:50,689
You see a man
with his eyes set,

624
00:40:50,691 --> 00:40:53,625
And his head on a bias,
like, and his teeth
anchored like a mule.

625
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:57,562
Well, you know, he'd just
as soon hang your guts
on a fence post as say,

626
00:40:57,564 --> 00:40:59,430
"great day," in the morning.

627
00:40:59,432 --> 00:41:01,231
Well, he a gunfighter,

628
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:02,465
Proud and feared of nothing.

629
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:06,635
'cause there ain't
nothin' walk on this Earth
he gotta bow down to.

630
00:41:06,637 --> 00:41:10,238
Not a man don't tip his hat.
Not a boy don't know his name.

631
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,306
And ain't no place
he ain't welcome.

632
00:41:12,308 --> 00:41:14,107
'cause when
a gunfighter around,

633
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:16,843
Trouble just naturally
stay away, huh?

634
00:41:16,845 --> 00:41:19,612
Folks sayin', "hiya, kid.

635
00:41:19,614 --> 00:41:20,679
"how you doin', kid?

636
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:23,248
"come on in! Have a pitcher
of milk and some gingerbread."

637
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:28,119
Or "come up on the porch
and cool your heels for a
while. It's hot outside."

638
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:30,788
Because nobody
don't make no fun

639
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,190
Of a friend of Kid Shelleen.

640
00:41:33,192 --> 00:41:36,026
Miss Ballou! I am here!

641
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:40,429
I never seen a man
get through a day so fast.

642
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,463
You leave him alone.

643
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,832
Cat, I ain't running
no dude ranch

644
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,800
For misfits
and unemployables.

645
00:41:45,802 --> 00:41:48,270
You keep him
away from me.

646
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,741
Where you gonna
go now, kid?

647
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:56,244
Why, Miss Ballou,
you paid me $50.

648
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:59,780
I aim to stay
and earn it.

649
00:42:03,018 --> 00:42:05,985
He can sleep
in the barn, Jackson.

650
00:42:07,922 --> 00:42:09,187
It's my gun.

651
00:42:09,189 --> 00:42:11,122
Hm? Oh.

652
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:19,229
Say, uh...
Mr. Shelleen?

653
00:42:19,231 --> 00:42:19,862
Hmm?

654
00:42:19,864 --> 00:42:22,331
Okay if I carry
your valise?

655
00:42:22,766 --> 00:42:24,165
Why, sure, kid.

656
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,367
Oh, uh, I ain't
got no cash.

657
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:28,102
Oh, uh, no need
to tip me, sir.

658
00:42:28,104 --> 00:42:31,205
It's gonna be a pleasure
to see you at work.

659
00:42:31,407 --> 00:42:33,273
(groaning)

660
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,475
How many in
the opposition?

661
00:42:36,477 --> 00:42:39,478
Oh, just one.
Tim Strawn.

662
00:42:44,551 --> 00:42:49,186
Well, waste not, want not.
Where's that jug of yours?

663
00:43:03,602 --> 00:43:06,536
Strawn. You sure?

664
00:43:06,538 --> 00:43:09,472
Yep. Silver nose and all.

665
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:21,683
Let Shelleen do it.

666
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:24,252
Oh, Shelleen isn't in
any condition to be...

667
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:25,253
He sure isn't.

668
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:27,688
Look, I'm counting
on you, all three of you.

669
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:31,958
My papa's a stubborn mule,
and he's gonna take chances,
and I can't let him.

670
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,392
You gotta stick with him.

671
00:43:33,394 --> 00:43:33,925
All: Yes, ma'am.

672
00:43:33,927 --> 00:43:35,426
Everywhere he goes,
no matter where.

673
00:43:35,428 --> 00:43:40,564
All right you unemployables.
Now, let's get
the day's work done.

674
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,632
Oh, for the love of Mike!

675
00:43:42,634 --> 00:43:46,435
A drunk in the bunkhouse,
and a circus act
following me around!

676
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:48,537
You stick with him, now.
Don't let him
out of your sight.

677
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:50,972
Kid Shelleen don't
have tobacco, does he?

678
00:43:50,974 --> 00:43:51,872
Could set fire to the barn.

679
00:43:51,874 --> 00:43:54,875
No, he's sleeping
it off, poor soul.

680
00:43:56,645 --> 00:43:58,645
Do you mind?

681
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:01,847
For cryin' up a storm,
what do you boys
think you're doin'?

682
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:04,783
Cat said stick with you,
and stick it is.

683
00:44:04,785 --> 00:44:06,985
Frankie:
She's crazy, I tell ya.

684
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:10,821
Always has been.
She sees things.

685
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:11,721
Her mother was like that.

686
00:44:11,723 --> 00:44:18,094
In the middle of the night,
she seen moon men,
creeping down the walls.

687
00:44:19,097 --> 00:44:19,595
Now, get away!

688
00:44:19,597 --> 00:44:23,432
I could trip on one
of you and get
trampled in the crowd.

689
00:44:23,434 --> 00:44:24,766
Why was I cursed
in my old age

690
00:44:24,768 --> 00:44:28,936
With a nutty daughter
and a bunch of
slack-twisted idiots?

691
00:44:28,938 --> 00:44:30,370
Now, who's here
to threaten me?

692
00:44:30,372 --> 00:44:32,605
You see anyone
over there?

693
00:44:32,607 --> 00:44:34,440
Or there?

694
00:44:34,575 --> 00:44:37,175
Or over that-a-way? Huh?

695
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:39,577
You see anybody anywhere?

696
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:43,547
Well, now stand back
and let me breathe!

697
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:47,550
(gunshot)

698
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,557
Drop the gun belts.

699
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,594
No...

700
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:03,631
No!

701
00:45:15,411 --> 00:45:17,244
No!

702
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,119
You're a murderer!

703
00:45:59,121 --> 00:46:00,253
You're gonna hang.

704
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:01,954
What is it?
What's wrong?

705
00:46:01,956 --> 00:46:02,754
You killed my father!

706
00:46:02,756 --> 00:46:06,958
Well, that can't be.
He's been sittin'
right there all morning.

707
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,525
No, I saw him.

708
00:46:07,527 --> 00:46:10,628
He hasn't been out
of that rocker all
morning long.

709
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,229
It's a fact.

710
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:14,597
Why do you say that?

711
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:17,166
Just telling the truth.

712
00:46:25,676 --> 00:46:28,176
So that's the way
it's gonna be.

713
00:46:28,178 --> 00:46:29,911
(whispering)
better get outta here.

714
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:30,978
Cat: No!

715
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:34,781
Wait a minute.
Get her off of him.
Get her outta here!

716
00:46:34,783 --> 00:46:36,816
Just a minute.
Don't you do that!

717
00:46:36,818 --> 00:46:38,551
(gunshot)
(bell ringing)

718
00:46:38,553 --> 00:46:39,485
Put that gun away!

719
00:46:39,487 --> 00:46:41,920
Get that gun
away from her.

720
00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:43,855
(gunshot)

721
00:46:46,926 --> 00:46:48,926
You stop it.

722
00:46:52,498 --> 00:46:54,898
You won't make me cry.

723
00:46:59,437 --> 00:47:01,537

You get out of my way!

747
00:49:01,346 --> 00:49:04,013
What have you done to him?

748
00:49:04,415 --> 00:49:06,181
Why is he smiling like that?

749
00:49:06,183 --> 00:49:07,549
Well, that was
hard, little lady.

750
00:49:07,551 --> 00:49:09,517
My father never
smiled like that
in his whole life.

751
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:12,586
Well, he'll smile
on now forever,
just as you see him.

752
00:49:12,588 --> 00:49:16,489
Free gratis from
the Wolf City
development corporation.

753
00:49:16,491 --> 00:49:17,323
Oh, you slimy rat!

754
00:49:17,325 --> 00:49:21,026
Get out of here! Get out.
Have respect for the dead.

755
00:49:23,597 --> 00:49:26,130
We dug a grave
behind the barn.

756
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:30,200
We'll stay to make
sure that you leave
before morning.

757
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,870
All right.
You take the ranch.

758
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:37,205
I don't want it,
now he's gone.

759
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,307
But you tell Wolf City
that before I'm through,

760
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,509
I'm gonna make
Sherman's march
to the sea

761
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,777
Look like a bird walk.

762
00:49:49,151 --> 00:49:50,683
Ma'am?

763
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:55,287
She ain't got
no place to go, Clay.

764
00:49:56,189 --> 00:49:56,987
We'll take her with us.

765
00:49:56,989 --> 00:50:00,156
Jed: Are you torched?
We can't take her there.

766
00:50:00,158 --> 00:50:01,123
Where?

767
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:03,225
Hole in the wall.

768
00:50:03,393 --> 00:50:04,191
Hole in the wall.

769
00:50:04,193 --> 00:50:07,227
Ma'am, it...
It ain't no place
for a schoolteacher.

770
00:50:07,229 --> 00:50:11,331
And besides, we don't
even know they'll
take us in.

771
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:12,765
Of course they'll take us.

772
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:14,399
It's a place for
outlaws, isn't it?

773
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:15,466
All you need is
a price on your head,

774
00:50:15,468 --> 00:50:18,302
And you've got that,
haven't you?

775
00:50:18,304 --> 00:50:20,237
We sure do.

776
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:23,840
Then it's all settled,
and I'm coming with you.

777
00:50:23,842 --> 00:50:26,209
Yee-ow!

778
00:50:27,345 --> 00:50:30,012
Hell, I'm loaded
for a bear.
Let him come.

779
00:50:30,014 --> 00:50:32,581
Anybody wanna try

780
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:33,682
Gotta take Kid Shelleen.

781
00:50:33,684 --> 00:50:38,186
Mr. Shelleen,
don't you see
what's going on?

782
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:43,824

Hi, honey!

808
00:52:52,072 --> 00:52:54,639
How 'bout a
little bubbly?

809
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:57,074
Later, sister. Later.

00:52:57,076 --> 00:52:58,909
Bartender!

811
00:52:59,244 --> 00:53:01,377
Hello in there!

812
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:03,479
I want a drink!

813
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:05,914
What's all the com...

814
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:09,917
Shelleen!

815
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:13,521
Think of that, Hedda.
It's Shelleen.

816
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:15,255
Cassidy.

817
00:53:15,257 --> 00:53:17,490
What happened to you?

818
00:53:17,492 --> 00:53:20,292
Ah, Cavalry, Pinkertons.

819
00:53:20,294 --> 00:53:22,360
The west has changed.

820
00:53:22,362 --> 00:53:24,762
For us, business is lousy.

821
00:53:24,764 --> 00:53:26,830
If we all didn't have
a price on our heads,

822
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:29,232
We'd get out
of this hole.

823
00:53:29,234 --> 00:53:29,665
Yeah.

824
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:33,001
Why don't we have a drink
for old time's sake?

825
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:34,135
"old time's sake?"

826
00:53:34,137 --> 00:53:35,936
Uh, that means you
got no cash.

827
00:53:35,938 --> 00:53:37,671
Nothing to it.

828
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:39,305
Look,

829
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:43,876
Hold these
for me till I can
get some money.

830
00:53:44,478 --> 00:53:45,410
Please, Cassidy.

831
00:53:45,412 --> 00:53:48,780
A matched brace
of pistols with
carved pearl handles.

832
00:53:48,782 --> 00:53:53,851
Hell, sentimental
value alone, they're
worth 5,600 apiece.

833
00:53:53,986 --> 00:53:56,152
Them ain't pearl-handled.

834
00:53:56,154 --> 00:53:57,920
And they ain't your guns.

835
00:53:57,922 --> 00:54:01,290
Anyways, no good
no more, kid.

836
00:54:01,725 --> 00:54:03,624
Nobody cares.

837
00:54:10,432 --> 00:54:10,963
Well, uncle,

838
00:54:10,965 --> 00:54:12,698
I guess we're gonna
go back into business.

839
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,268
Remember those fat little
Herefords we looked at
over in Yatrona County?

840
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,569
Anybody for
buyin' a round?

841
00:54:17,571 --> 00:54:21,439
Well, gonna need
more than just
two of us.

842
00:54:21,441 --> 00:54:23,140
Well, what about
you, Jackson?

843
00:54:23,142 --> 00:54:25,609
I mean, you being
an Indian and all.

844
00:54:25,611 --> 00:54:27,877
Uh, you just gonna
go back to livin'
off the land?

845
00:54:27,879 --> 00:54:30,646
You foolin'?
You try livin' out
in these mountains,

846
00:54:30,648 --> 00:54:32,881
Naked, nothin'
but a stone ax.

847
00:54:32,883 --> 00:54:34,349
All right, then.
The three of us.

848
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:35,850
We'll amble over
to Yatrona County

849
00:54:35,852 --> 00:54:38,819
And help ourselves
to, uh...

850
00:54:40,122 --> 00:54:41,688
Ooh, 50 head.

851
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:42,955
50 head!

852
00:54:42,957 --> 00:54:44,589
(whistling)
that's big!

853
00:54:44,591 --> 00:54:45,690
I'll drink to that!

854
00:54:45,692 --> 00:54:47,091
Then it's
all settled.

855
00:54:47,093 --> 00:54:47,958
Wait a minute!
Hold it. Hold it.

856
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,260
You got something
to say about our plan?

857
00:54:50,262 --> 00:54:52,528
Yes. I'm against it.

858
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,230
Ma'am, I can
understand your
objection to rustling,

859
00:54:55,232 --> 00:54:57,498
A girl with your
background and
gentle upbringing,

860
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,000
But it's the only way
we can raise money.

861
00:55:00,002 --> 00:55:00,767
No, it's not.

862
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:03,302
Well, now, what do you
think we ought to do

863
00:55:03,304 --> 00:55:06,238
That's fittin'
and proper?

864
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,473
Rob a train.

865
00:55:08,675 --> 00:55:11,375
That butcher, Eggers,
over in Dixon,
he'll take 35 head.

866
00:55:11,377 --> 00:55:13,777
He'll take 'em right
on the hoof and
butcher 'em himself.

867
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:16,880
Well, what about
what I said?

868
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:18,414
Look at this.

869
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:21,016
This is the Wolf City
Tribune of two days ago.

870
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:23,218
Uh, "two hundred
working men

871
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,286
"stand poised and ready
to start working Monday

872
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:28,422
"on the largest
slaughterhouse this
side of Chicago."

873
00:55:28,424 --> 00:55:30,757
Well, what's that got
to do with a train?

874
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:32,792
Working men gotta
be paid, don't they?

875
00:55:32,794 --> 00:55:34,827
There's gonna be
a payroll coming through.

876
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:37,563
I don't know.
Maybe $1000, $2000?

877
00:55:37,565 --> 00:55:39,364
I will drink to that.

878
00:55:39,366 --> 00:55:41,332
Can't hold up no train.

879
00:55:41,334 --> 00:55:41,832
Why not?

880
00:55:41,834 --> 00:55:43,500
Lots of reasons.
Name 'em.

881
00:55:43,502 --> 00:55:45,235
Clay: We're rustlers,
not train robbers.

882
00:55:45,237 --> 00:55:46,135
If people didn't
try something new,

883
00:55:46,137 --> 00:55:47,870
There wouldn't
be hardly any
progress at all.

884
00:55:47,872 --> 00:55:50,239
Look, now,
you're out of
your mind!

885
00:55:50,241 --> 00:55:52,908
Squeeze blood outta
them in your dreams!

886
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:54,376
Build your life anew, ma'am.

887
00:55:54,378 --> 00:55:57,011
This... This studying
on revenge is just

888
00:55:57,013 --> 00:55:58,212
Turning your back
on the future

889
00:55:58,214 --> 00:56:00,614
And letting the dead
past eat at your heart.

890
00:56:00,616 --> 00:56:02,449
They can't even touch us
in hole in the wall.

891
00:56:02,451 --> 00:56:06,953
We can use Shelleen's
own plan for train robbery.

892
00:56:07,488 --> 00:56:08,887
My plan?

893
00:56:08,889 --> 00:56:10,154
Yeah.

894
00:56:10,156 --> 00:56:11,655
Chapter seven.

895
00:56:11,657 --> 00:56:13,023
"the Whiskey Slide
and Tuskegon Railroad

896
00:56:13,025 --> 00:56:16,226
"had an armored baggage
car that was considered
bandit-proof."

897
00:56:16,228 --> 00:56:18,494
"and to me, that was
a challenge that made it
a matter of pride

898
00:56:18,496 --> 00:56:21,396
"to see that it was
robbed as soon as
I got around to it."

899
00:56:21,398 --> 00:56:23,598
And so on and so on.

900
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,932
That plan.

901
00:56:24,934 --> 00:56:26,800
(laughing)

902
00:56:31,406 --> 00:56:33,172
All right!

903
00:56:33,174 --> 00:56:35,240
You all say you love me
and are beholden to me.

904
00:56:35,242 --> 00:56:38,710
And, and, "take it
easy, Cat. We're gonna
take care of you."

905
00:56:38,712 --> 00:56:41,145
And the first time
I ask you to do one
little thing for me,

906
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,547
Like rob one
little train...

907
00:56:43,549 --> 00:56:46,650
Jed: Now, hold on, ma'am!

908
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:49,318
Jackson: Listen, Miss Ballou!

909
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,787
Some gang!
Whoa!

910
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:54,990
A horse-ranch Indian,
a drunken gunfighter,

911
00:56:54,992 --> 00:56:56,458
A sex maniac,

912
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,326
And an uncle.

913
00:56:58,328 --> 00:56:59,994
Ow!
Look out!

914
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:01,762
Clay: Now, look here.

915
00:57:01,764 --> 00:57:02,429
Ow!

916
00:57:02,431 --> 00:57:05,298
Clay Boone and his gang
of chicken-rustlers.

917
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,233
I'm gonna do it alone!

918
00:57:07,235 --> 00:57:08,901
Hey, did we say no? Ow!

919
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:12,604
Will ya cut out the cryin'?
We'll do it for ya!

920
00:57:12,606 --> 00:57:13,471
You will?

921
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:16,474
This is the last thing.
Crazy dame.

922
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:18,375
That plan?

923
00:57:19,378 --> 00:57:22,112
(whistle blowing)

924
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:55,711
What in the
blue-eyed world?

925
00:57:55,713 --> 00:57:57,979
I'm taking a bath.
What's so odd
about that?

926
00:57:57,981 --> 00:58:01,215
(stutters) well, I...
I'm looking for
the baggage car.

927
00:58:01,217 --> 00:58:02,049
Well, it's the
other way, man!

928
00:58:02,051 --> 00:58:05,952
And, oh, pull
those drapes.
I'm freezing.

929
00:58:05,954 --> 00:58:07,420
Yes, sir.

930
00:58:07,422 --> 00:58:08,354
Much obliged!

931
00:58:08,356 --> 00:58:11,423
More water,
more water.
Yes, sir.

932
00:58:19,132 --> 00:58:21,265
(footsteps)

933
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:27,437
(footsteps)

934
00:58:27,872 --> 00:58:30,172
(wailing)

935
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,825
Here she comes.

936
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:03,103
Come on. We got
a job to do.

937
00:59:06,741 --> 00:59:08,507
Do we.

938
00:59:18,986 --> 00:59:20,986
My word!

939
00:59:20,988 --> 00:59:23,088
(chickens clucking)

940
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:23,955
Are you all
right, miss?

941
00:59:23,957 --> 00:59:26,290
(knocking)
Jed: Hey, let me outta here!

942
00:59:26,292 --> 00:59:27,457
What's that?

943
00:59:27,459 --> 00:59:28,925
He's alive!
Uh!

944
00:59:28,927 --> 00:59:31,961
We... We gotta
let him out!

945
00:59:33,597 --> 00:59:35,296
(coughing)

946
00:59:35,298 --> 00:59:36,830
What happened?

947
00:59:36,832 --> 00:59:39,065
Put up your hands!

948
00:59:40,468 --> 00:59:41,500
And keep 'em up.

949
00:59:41,502 --> 00:59:43,935
Kid: Come on, you.

950
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:51,074
Cat! Cat! Let me in!

951
00:59:52,944 --> 00:59:54,843
Go on, get out!

952
00:59:59,216 --> 01:00:00,215
Who's in charge here?
I am.

953
01:00:00,217 --> 01:00:02,317
Well, what's happening?
What's the delay?

954
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,184
This is a
train robbery.

955
01:00:03,186 --> 01:00:07,087
Well, get along with it.
I'm trying to take my bath.

956
01:00:07,456 --> 01:00:09,255
(all laughing)

957
01:00:09,257 --> 01:00:11,023
Oh!

958
01:00:21,402 --> 01:00:23,802
(whistle blowing)

959
01:00:28,775 --> 01:00:30,908
Here's the safe.

960
01:00:31,777 --> 01:00:34,144
Okay, you, open up.

961
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,879
Nope.

962
01:00:38,582 --> 01:00:41,249
Now, come on,
now. Open it.

963
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:43,517
I got a gun.

964
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:46,319
Well, you just gonna
have to use it.

965
01:00:50,224 --> 01:00:50,922
What are we gonna do?

966
01:00:50,924 --> 01:00:53,925
I told you this
could happen.
What are we gonna do?

967
01:00:57,864 --> 01:00:58,863
What's wrong?

968
01:00:58,865 --> 01:01:01,532
He won't open the safe.
Says he'd rather die.

969
01:01:01,534 --> 01:01:03,534
Is that right, mister?

970
01:01:03,536 --> 01:01:05,002
Yeah.

971
01:01:06,138 --> 01:01:08,471
Seven left, 26 right, 14 left.

972
01:01:08,473 --> 01:01:10,206
Ya-hoo!

973
01:01:10,408 --> 01:01:12,274
(chuckling)

974
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,448
Oh, this is more than
the $2000 you said.

975
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:23,417
Nearer 40,
50,000, I'd say.

976
01:01:24,019 --> 01:01:25,051
You know, this is
a heap of money.

977
01:01:25,053 --> 01:01:26,519
We take it, they'll
booger us forever.

978
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:30,189
Oh, listen to him.
Who's afraid of
a little booger?

979
01:01:31,425 --> 01:01:32,891
Aaahh!

980
01:01:33,526 --> 01:01:34,758
Oh!

981
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,595
I give up!
Hand me a towel.

982
01:01:41,633 --> 01:01:43,032
Bah!

983
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:46,501
Ohh!

984
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,582
Come on, jump.
Jump?

985
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:02,549
Jump!

986
01:02:02,551 --> 01:02:05,219
Cat: Ya-hoo!

987
01:02:06,822 --> 01:02:08,555
(laughing)

988
01:02:10,759 --> 01:02:13,059
Yee-haw!

989
01:02:13,061 --> 01:02:14,960
Let's get outta here.

990
01:02:14,962 --> 01:02:15,527
Oh, we did it!

991
01:02:15,529 --> 01:02:18,196
My little gang
of sweet outlaws. Oh!

992
01:02:18,198 --> 01:02:20,298
That messenger seemed
like a real nice man.

993
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,534
Oh, Shelleen,
it was a great plan.

994
01:02:23,536 --> 01:02:26,970
Yeah, it worked
just like clockwork.

995
01:02:26,972 --> 01:02:29,072
Are you sure?

996
01:02:30,442 --> 01:02:33,209
I am so proud of you.

997
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:35,544
Oh, it was just
beginner's luck.

998
01:02:35,546 --> 01:02:36,945
Hey, come on, now.
We gotta get moving.

999
01:02:36,947 --> 01:02:37,979
Yeah, Clay's
right, ma'am.

1000
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:40,581
Ask him if he knows
how we're gonna
get outta here.

1001
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:43,283
You did escape
in that book, didn't ya?

1002
01:02:43,285 --> 01:02:46,419
Of course he did.
Oh, you darling,
Shelleen.

1003
01:02:46,421 --> 01:02:48,954
We ride out separately
in case they try to track us.

1004
01:02:48,956 --> 01:02:53,291
Then we mix up our
trail and meet back
at hole in the wall.

1005
01:02:53,293 --> 01:02:55,293
Right!
Yeah.

1006
01:02:57,964 --> 01:02:59,697
Come on, boy!

1007
01:03:18,451 --> 01:03:19,950
Whuh!

1008
01:03:20,752 --> 01:03:22,785

01:03:24,655 --> 01:03:26,521

Drinks on the house.

Hedda, you old heifer.
(screaming)

1027
01:05:29,806 --> 01:05:30,871
We got money!

1028
01:05:30,873 --> 01:05:31,538
And the train guard,

1029
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:33,006
Hair all over
the six foot five of him,

1030
01:05:33,008 --> 01:05:34,607

Ha-ha!

1033
01:05:37,578 --> 01:05:40,745
Everything went
slicker than...

1034
01:05:44,484 --> 01:05:45,649
Where are those kids?

1035
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:46,349
They ain't been seen.

1036
01:05:46,351 --> 01:05:48,684
Kid, will you
lend me a bullet?

1037
01:05:48,686 --> 01:05:51,586
You remember me?
Old...

1038
01:05:52,288 --> 01:05:54,221
Old...

1039
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,862
Well, I'm tellin' you,
Cassidy.

1040
01:06:02,864 --> 01:06:06,198
Them kids are comin'
with the payroll.

1041
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:09,433
It was just
like old times.

1042
01:06:10,469 --> 01:06:11,167
(door opening)

1043
01:06:11,169 --> 01:06:12,902
Money, money, money
for a rainy day!

1044
01:06:12,904 --> 01:06:15,537
Ah, they are here.
Cut your throat, Cassidy!

1045
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:18,940
Come on, help me clear
this table, will ya?

1046
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:21,609
Get it out there.

1047
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:22,509
Yo! Yeah!

1048
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:26,145
Hey, where you two been
together all alone?

1049
01:06:26,147 --> 01:06:27,913
Out losin' that posse.

1050
01:06:27,915 --> 01:06:29,614
Cat, was he
botherin' you?

1051
01:06:29,616 --> 01:06:30,314
No, siree, bob!

1052
01:06:30,316 --> 01:06:32,015
His uncle Jed was
right on the job.

1053
01:06:32,017 --> 01:06:34,283
Old steel eyes
is jealous.

1054
01:06:34,285 --> 01:06:35,417
You got no respect.

1055
01:06:35,419 --> 01:06:36,985
Time was I'd take
a pimple like you

1056
01:06:36,987 --> 01:06:38,486
And wretch you out
and squeeze.

1057
01:06:38,488 --> 01:06:41,422
What is the matter
with you two?

1058
01:06:41,924 --> 01:06:44,524
Give the old man
a drink, Mr. Cassidy.

1059
01:06:44,526 --> 01:06:47,727
No. And there's more
where that came from.

1060
01:06:47,729 --> 01:06:49,662
You mean it?
He really did do it?

1061
01:06:49,664 --> 01:06:52,564
We did it,
Mr. Cassidy.

1062
01:06:52,699 --> 01:06:54,031
My gang.

1063
01:06:54,033 --> 01:06:55,198
Right? And this is
just the beginning.

1064
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,700
We're gonna wipe out
Wolf City!

1065
01:06:57,702 --> 01:07:00,502
You help me,
and I'll make you rich.

1066
01:07:02,339 --> 01:07:05,039
"Wolf City Development.

1067
01:07:05,374 --> 01:07:08,274
"property: H. Percival."

1068
01:07:08,276 --> 01:07:11,010
She stole their payroll,
Hedda.

1069
01:07:11,012 --> 01:07:11,677
Of course.

1070
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:15,781
You ever hear of
Mr. Sir Harry Percival?

1071
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:17,616
He owns
the Wolf City Development,

1072
01:07:17,618 --> 01:07:21,119
Which owns Wolf City,
which lets us alone.

1073
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:24,322
We don't bother them
nor Sir Harry Percival,

1074
01:07:24,324 --> 01:07:26,057
And they don't bother us.

1075
01:07:26,059 --> 01:07:28,092
Sir Harry Percival.

1076
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:30,259
That's the man
I should be after.

1077
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:33,629
You? How you
gonna find him?

1078
01:07:33,631 --> 01:07:35,297
You mean
you won't help us?

1079
01:07:35,299 --> 01:07:36,398
Cut our own throats?

1080
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,967
Hole in the wall's
impregnable.

1081
01:07:39,069 --> 01:07:39,934
No such thing.

1082
01:07:39,936 --> 01:07:43,270
Takes more trouble
than we've been worth
to dig us out.

1083
01:07:43,272 --> 01:07:45,505
Now you made it worthwhile!

1084
01:07:46,107 --> 01:07:49,641
Some gang of cutthroats
and murderers.

1085
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:52,777
We used to
whisper your names
when we were kids,

1086
01:07:52,779 --> 01:07:56,013
Scared to say
them out loud.

1087
01:07:56,715 --> 01:07:58,414
How sad.

1088
01:08:01,152 --> 01:08:02,951
You got old.

1089
01:08:11,995 --> 01:08:13,260
Count out the shares, Jed.

1090
01:08:13,262 --> 01:08:16,930
Give them all drinks
on Cat Ballou.

1091
01:08:36,284 --> 01:08:37,049
Yahoo!
Oh!

1092
01:08:37,051 --> 01:08:41,820
Some schoolteacher.
Cat Ballou's college
of bust 'em in the nose!

1093
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:45,622
What was that for?

1094
01:08:45,624 --> 01:08:48,358
I think we'll
go to St. Louis.

1095
01:08:49,427 --> 01:08:50,526
St. Louis?

1096
01:08:50,528 --> 01:08:53,061
Yeah, St. Louis.
City on the Missouri.

1097
01:08:53,063 --> 01:08:55,897
Railhead of the Santa Fe,
jump off of the Oregon Trail.

1098
01:08:55,899 --> 01:09:00,268
Produces beef, beer, shoes,
and, uh, some good times.

1099
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:01,836
But why?

1100
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:03,170
Well, we got their money.

1101
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:05,405
What's the sense of
hanging around till they
come looking for it?

1102
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:09,509
But, Clay, we've got them
where we want them.
They're desperate.

1103
01:09:09,511 --> 01:09:11,744
They're desperate?

1104
01:09:12,012 --> 01:09:14,512
Let's go to St. Louis.

1105
01:09:25,725 --> 01:09:27,257
Clay, I...

1106
01:09:27,259 --> 01:09:29,592
I think I love you.

1107
01:09:30,194 --> 01:09:30,759
(scoffing)

1108
01:09:30,761 --> 01:09:32,994
There you go,
all serious
all of a sudden.

1109
01:09:32,996 --> 01:09:35,162
You know, you're like
all the rest of them,

1110
01:09:35,164 --> 01:09:37,364
You gotta be in love
with some guy.

1111
01:09:37,366 --> 01:09:39,733
Now, come on, let's...
Don't be so serious!

1112
01:09:39,735 --> 01:09:43,269
You know, you're not anything
like you think you are.

1113
01:09:43,271 --> 01:09:44,937
Oh, no?

1114
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:47,005
How's that?

1115
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:49,740
Cowardy Custard.

1116
01:09:49,742 --> 01:09:52,109
Oh, you're selfish
and a little stupid,

1117
01:09:52,111 --> 01:09:54,144
But you're not
cowardly at all.

1118
01:09:54,146 --> 01:09:56,179
Ha. Well, I mean, ah...

1119
01:09:56,181 --> 01:09:59,949
Say, when you admire a man,
you just go all out,
don't you?

1120
01:09:59,951 --> 01:10:00,950
Love is not blind.

1121
01:10:00,952 --> 01:10:02,751
I see all your faults,
and I know
what you're like,

1122
01:10:02,753 --> 01:10:04,853
And I don't care,
I love you anyway!

1123
01:10:04,855 --> 01:10:08,756
Love, love, love.
I was gonna take you
to St. Louis with me!

1124
01:10:08,758 --> 01:10:11,425
Just throw our hats
in the air.

1125
01:10:11,427 --> 01:10:12,526
Now I don't know.

1126
01:10:12,528 --> 01:10:15,595
Now I see trouble coming,
and not just from them.

1127
01:10:15,597 --> 01:10:18,264
Why? Where else
do you see trouble?

1128
01:10:23,471 --> 01:10:25,170
Right there.

1129
01:10:25,172 --> 01:10:28,139
In those big blue eyes.

1130
01:10:29,542 --> 01:10:31,275
Oh, no.

1131
01:10:31,543 --> 01:10:36,045
Ain't gonna get
tied down with no girl.
No, I'm going.

1132
01:10:43,521 --> 01:10:47,723
You know,
you're gonna get
yourself killed.

1133
01:10:47,925 --> 01:10:48,723
Well, what do you care?

1134
01:10:48,725 --> 01:10:53,027
My death is hardly gonna
cause a ripple in St. Louis.

1135
01:10:57,433 --> 01:11:00,500
Well... I'm leavin'.

1136
01:11:06,841 --> 01:11:10,509
I... I never
promised to be
no hero, now, did I?

1137
01:11:10,511 --> 01:11:14,579
Well, you're no hero,
so don't worry about it.

1138
01:11:14,581 --> 01:11:16,213
You've got no right
to think about me

1139
01:11:16,215 --> 01:11:17,414
What you're
thinking about me.

1140
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:19,582
Oh, why don't
you just go?

1141
01:11:21,252 --> 01:11:22,651
Bye.

1142
01:11:34,965 --> 01:11:37,799
Jackson, what's happening?

1143
01:11:40,203 --> 01:11:42,069
It's ghost sickness.

1144
01:11:42,271 --> 01:11:42,736
What?

1145
01:11:42,738 --> 01:11:45,238
This Indian religion,
see...

1146
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,808
We believe what
the gods did when
they made a man crazy

1147
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:50,709
Was they...

1148
01:11:51,344 --> 01:11:53,444
Made him fall in love.

1149
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,914
Well, that's very
poetic, Jackson.

1150
01:11:57,916 --> 01:12:00,116
What does that
have to do with us?

1151
01:12:00,118 --> 01:12:02,651
Who is in love?
And with who?

1152
01:12:03,086 --> 01:12:04,952
With "whom."

1153
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:07,087
(laughing)

1154
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:10,891
Well, now,
that's another question.

1155
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:13,093
Jackson, what am I
gonna do?

1156
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:16,229
Ain't much
you can do about us.

1157
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:20,299
Reckon I'll see
you later, ma'am.

1158
01:12:20,301 --> 01:12:23,335
Jackson, what about you?
You'll stay, won't you?

1159
01:12:23,337 --> 01:12:28,840
I, I get a kick out of
being on the winning side
for a change.

1160
01:12:46,326 --> 01:12:48,926
(branches rustling)

1161
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:54,964
Sir Harry wants
his money and fast.

1162
01:12:54,966 --> 01:13:01,203
If you wasn't a girl,
I'd split you
like a chicken.

1163
01:13:01,205 --> 01:13:03,505
(Cat screaming)

1164
01:13:05,876 --> 01:13:07,342
Jed!

1165
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:08,509
What do you want, Cat?
Oh, Jackson.

1166
01:13:08,511 --> 01:13:13,380
That man with
the silver nose was here.
He's gonna kill me.

1167
01:13:14,249 --> 01:13:16,148
Strawn.

1168
01:13:18,886 --> 01:13:20,952
Jackson.

1169
01:13:21,788 --> 01:13:23,754
You know that
valise of mine?

1170
01:13:23,756 --> 01:13:25,288
Yeah, kid.

1171
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:26,222
You go find it.

1172
01:13:26,224 --> 01:13:29,959
And get a case of
cartridges from Cassidy.

1173
01:13:34,999 --> 01:13:37,966
We'll always be here
with you, ma'am.

1174
01:13:38,201 --> 01:13:41,802
It'll be all right, Cat.

1175
01:13:41,804 --> 01:13:44,871
Everything's gonna be okay.

1176
01:13:54,782 --> 01:13:57,616
What's in this, kid?

1177
01:14:32,619 --> 01:14:36,020
(gunshots)

1178
01:14:53,472 --> 01:14:55,438
Want a drink?

1179
01:14:56,007 --> 01:14:57,439
No booze.

1180
01:14:57,441 --> 01:14:58,673
No?

1181
01:14:58,675 --> 01:15:00,107
No.

1182
01:15:03,712 --> 01:15:07,180
(gunshots)

1183
01:15:11,886 --> 01:15:13,852
(clicking)

1184
01:18:52,539 --> 01:18:54,872
(piano playing
gentle melody)

1185
01:18:54,874 --> 01:18:58,709

1214
01:20:57,415 --> 01:21:00,015
Hello, kid.

1215
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:02,883
Long time.

1216
01:21:03,552 --> 01:21:06,019
Sit down.

1217
01:21:06,087 --> 01:21:10,089
Where you been
keeping yourself?

1218
01:21:11,425 --> 01:21:13,425
You want a job?

1219
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:15,994
Some money?

1220
01:21:16,363 --> 01:21:19,597
Not money
and not a job.

1221
01:21:19,599 --> 01:21:21,365
What then?

1222
01:21:24,069 --> 01:21:25,435
Oh.

1223
01:21:25,437 --> 01:21:26,669
That.

1224
01:21:26,671 --> 01:21:33,142
Well, there never was
any love lost between us.

1225
01:21:34,612 --> 01:21:36,011
Well?

1226
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:41,048
Well?

1227
01:21:41,784 --> 01:21:43,450
I can't.

1228
01:21:43,452 --> 01:21:45,385
Why not?

1229
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:54,059
(gunshot)

1230
01:21:54,061 --> 01:21:55,794
A gunfight.

1231
01:21:57,731 --> 01:21:59,497
(gasping)

1232
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:11,141
Ohhh, it was just swell.

1233
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:14,977
Just the way
I figured it'd be.

1234
01:22:15,379 --> 01:22:16,010
Even when we was kids,

1235
01:22:16,012 --> 01:22:17,511
He's always sneakin'
around behind a barn,

1236
01:22:17,513 --> 01:22:20,046
Tryin' to get behind
some kid and back
shoot him.

1237
01:22:20,048 --> 01:22:21,013
Well, I know this, see.

1238
01:22:21,015 --> 01:22:24,082
So when I walk in,
I gab with him.

1239
01:22:24,084 --> 01:22:26,984
I figured I'd call his shot
when I turn my back.

1240
01:22:26,986 --> 01:22:28,385
Well, he don't even
believe it was me.

1241
01:22:28,387 --> 01:22:33,056
He thinks I'm still
on the booze like
last time in Tombstone.

1242
01:22:33,058 --> 01:22:35,591
When was that?
Ten or 12?

1243
01:22:35,593 --> 01:22:37,926
My, oh, my.
How that booze
will do your mind.

1244
01:22:37,928 --> 01:22:42,063
Fog your mind
so you can't remember
a darn thing.

1245
01:22:42,698 --> 01:22:45,598
Oh, it was just fine.

1246
01:22:45,967 --> 01:22:49,702
You and Strawn used to
play together when you
were children?

1247
01:22:50,771 --> 01:22:52,604
He was my brother.

1248
01:22:52,606 --> 01:22:54,205
What?

1249
01:22:54,907 --> 01:22:56,439
Like that time
in Tombstone

1250
01:22:56,441 --> 01:22:57,773
When he took my guns
away from me,

1251
01:22:57,775 --> 01:22:58,807
Made me walk down
the street,

1252
01:22:58,809 --> 01:23:02,510
Stripped down to nothing'
but long-handles and my hat.

1253
01:23:02,612 --> 01:23:07,014
Well, I took him just
like the dime novel said.

1254
01:23:08,017 --> 01:23:10,751
It was just fine.

1255
01:23:10,853 --> 01:23:12,686
Kid, your own brother?

1256
01:23:12,688 --> 01:23:15,522
Kid Shelleen
and Cat Ballou.

1257
01:23:15,524 --> 01:23:18,892
Old steel eyes really
brought the roof down!

1258
01:23:18,894 --> 01:23:19,492
Hold it right there.

1259
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,927
You know half of
Wolf City's on the way
up here right now?

1260
01:23:21,929 --> 01:23:24,296
We'll take them like
the last time, huh, Cat?

1261
01:23:24,298 --> 01:23:25,730
Now they got that
Englishman's goons.

1262
01:23:25,732 --> 01:23:28,299
Must be 50 of 'em,
more coming on every train!

1263
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:29,233
The Englishman?

1264
01:23:29,235 --> 01:23:30,100
Sir Harry Percival.

1265
01:23:30,102 --> 01:23:32,602
Owns Wolf City Development.
He's here himself.

1266
01:23:32,604 --> 01:23:34,337
What did they
look like?

1267
01:23:34,339 --> 01:23:37,740
Are they professional men
or just barroom sweeps?

1268
01:23:37,742 --> 01:23:40,275
Now you just
stop and think,
concentrate.

1269
01:23:40,277 --> 01:23:42,744
Because you are
scared and confused.

1270
01:23:42,746 --> 01:23:45,113
Big men. A dutchman
from Pennsylvania,

1271
01:23:45,115 --> 01:23:47,682
A Polish from Chicago,
Swedes from Dakota.

1272
01:23:47,684 --> 01:23:48,749
Hard! You could
roller skate on 'em.

1273
01:23:48,751 --> 01:23:50,884
With Strawn dead,
they're nothing but
barroom sweeps.

1274
01:23:50,886 --> 01:23:53,920
Strawn wasn't nothing
but a hired hand.
I tell you, this is an army.

1275
01:23:53,922 --> 01:23:55,288
And I'm taking you
out of here with me.

1276
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:57,923
No, wait a minute.
Are you sure it's him?

1277
01:23:57,925 --> 01:24:00,091
Uh, that Englishman
wants a fight, huh?

1278
01:24:00,093 --> 01:24:03,661
We'll give him the biggest
gunfight they ever did see.

1279
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:04,595
Clay: He wants to die!

1280
01:24:04,597 --> 01:24:06,897
Look, I've done everything
I ever wanted to.

1281
01:24:06,899 --> 01:24:09,165
There's no place
I wanna go back to.

1282
01:24:09,167 --> 01:24:10,633
It'll be history.

1283
01:24:10,635 --> 01:24:12,401
Kid Shelleen
and Cat Ballou.

1284
01:24:12,403 --> 01:24:15,737
You sad old bag of guts.
You're gonna get her
killed, too.

1285
01:24:15,739 --> 01:24:18,773
Look, better than
dyin' in some cold,
dirty ol' hotel.

1286
01:24:18,775 --> 01:24:21,175
And I was always afeared
of dyin' in the gutter

1287
01:24:21,177 --> 01:24:23,844
With a bellyful of
bad booze.

1288
01:24:23,846 --> 01:24:26,213
Then Cat came along.

1289
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:29,215
Kid.

1290
01:24:29,217 --> 01:24:33,819
There's still places
I want to see, and things
I want to do.

1291
01:24:34,555 --> 01:24:37,055
I don't want to die.

1292
01:24:41,094 --> 01:24:44,929
Now you're making sense!
Come on, let's go to
St. Louis.

1293
01:24:44,931 --> 01:24:47,464
Oh, you don't ever
change, do you?

1294
01:24:47,466 --> 01:24:51,468
Not St. Louis?
How about Sioux Falls?

1295
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:52,402
Or any place.

1296
01:24:52,404 --> 01:24:55,705
What's the matter?
You afraid someone will
see you with me?

1297
01:24:55,707 --> 01:24:57,873
I'll even marry you!

1298
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:58,707
Marry me?

1299
01:24:58,709 --> 01:24:59,574
Well, that's what I said.

1300
01:24:59,576 --> 01:25:02,643
I mean, if that's
what I gotta do to
save you, I'll do it!

1301
01:25:02,645 --> 01:25:07,748
Of all the self-centered,
egotistical things I ever
heard!

1302
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:08,482
Why do men always think

1303
01:25:08,484 --> 01:25:10,550
That marriage is
the only thing women have
on their minds?

1304
01:25:10,552 --> 01:25:14,220
Why don't you go fight
or wash your socks?

1305
01:25:17,024 --> 01:25:19,691
I've been studying on it.

1306
01:25:19,859 --> 01:25:23,293
And now
I'm beginning to see.

1307
01:25:24,062 --> 01:25:27,096
She loves you. Not me.

1308
01:25:27,098 --> 01:25:29,398
Now, come on now,
steel eyes.

1309
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:32,667
And you, all the time,
laughing at me.

1310
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:35,970
Silly old man looking
after that young thing.

1311
01:25:35,972 --> 01:25:39,773
Well, bub,
I'm gonna see that you
do the right thing.

1312
01:25:39,775 --> 01:25:42,041
Right thing?
Yeah.

1313
01:25:43,577 --> 01:25:45,443
Ahhh!

1314
01:25:45,578 --> 01:25:48,245
Guns, bottles,
fists, knives, clubs.

1315
01:25:48,247 --> 01:25:50,013
All the same to me.
All the same to you?

1316
01:25:50,015 --> 01:25:52,615
What are you
talking about?
Marry her!

1317
01:25:52,617 --> 01:25:54,850
I'll marry her,
but she said
she don't want me.

1318
01:25:54,852 --> 01:25:56,218
Don't listen to her!
Marry her!

1319
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:59,387
Kid! I'm trying to tell you,
she won't marry me.

1320
01:25:59,389 --> 01:26:02,390
First, you don't think
you can stand to get hit.

1321
01:26:02,392 --> 01:26:03,357
Then you realize
you can take it

1322
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:06,393
Because the blood
don't matter, and you
know you're gonna live.

1323
01:26:06,395 --> 01:26:10,764
It's a great gift
I'm gonna give you,
to know it don't hurt.

1324
01:26:10,766 --> 01:26:11,731
Fight!

1325
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,332
No!

1326
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:17,970
Ah.

1327
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:20,839
Well, I'm gonna straighten
you out once and for all.

1328
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:24,843
Hey, leave him alone.
He's mine.
I'm beating up on him.

1329
01:26:24,845 --> 01:26:25,443
He's my kin.

1330
01:26:25,445 --> 01:26:28,746
His morals have been
a millstone around
my neck all my life.

1331
01:26:28,748 --> 01:26:30,080
Ahhh!

1332
01:26:34,152 --> 01:26:35,484
What was that for?

1333
01:26:35,486 --> 01:26:36,818
Well, everybody else
was doing it.

1334
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:38,286
I got a right to
share in the fun

1335
01:26:38,288 --> 01:26:40,454
Without regard to race,
creed or color

1336
01:26:40,456 --> 01:26:43,356
According to
the 14th Amendment.

1337
01:26:43,591 --> 01:26:47,192
Can I have my store back,
now that she's going?

1338
01:26:47,194 --> 01:26:48,660
What?

1339
01:26:51,064 --> 01:26:53,264
It's Cat.
Where's she going?

1340
01:26:53,266 --> 01:26:56,834
Sir, a consolation
from the town.

1341
01:27:02,908 --> 01:27:06,809
Sir Harry Percival,
I presume?

1342
01:27:07,144 --> 01:27:09,077
Really.

1343
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:14,415
Roughing it on
the frontier, delightful.

1344
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:16,116
Oh.

1345
01:27:16,118 --> 01:27:19,385
You like our
wide-open spaces?

1346
01:27:19,387 --> 01:27:20,519
Ohh...

1347
01:27:20,521 --> 01:27:21,753
Positively charming.

1348
01:27:21,755 --> 01:27:24,589
Lovely country,
lots of fresh air.

1349
01:27:24,591 --> 01:27:28,926
I'm getting frightfully
healthy, you know?

1350
01:27:29,461 --> 01:27:33,329
Oh, it's just
simply gorgeous.

1351
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:34,897
Simply gorgeous.

1352
01:27:34,899 --> 01:27:39,601
Don't let anybody ever
tell you different.

1353
01:27:41,638 --> 01:27:45,039
Oh, look at that.
A painting on the ceiling.

1354
01:27:45,641 --> 01:27:48,375
Oh, yes,
that's a Tintoretto.

1355
01:27:48,377 --> 01:27:49,776
I'll say it is.

1356
01:27:49,778 --> 01:27:50,910
Do you like it?

1357
01:27:50,912 --> 01:27:51,911
I think
it's even more gorgeous

1358
01:27:51,913 --> 01:27:54,813
Than the girl with
the chairs above
Natalie Paige's Bar,

1359
01:27:54,815 --> 01:27:57,715
And that's the most
gorgeous thing I ever saw.

1360
01:27:57,717 --> 01:27:59,917
Ohhh.

1361
01:28:02,554 --> 01:28:04,320
Ooh!

1362
01:28:04,522 --> 01:28:07,389
My name is Trixie.

1363
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:13,427
Oh, Trixie!

1364
01:28:13,429 --> 01:28:14,127
Ohhh.

1365
01:28:14,129 --> 01:28:17,897
May I offer you something
to drink, Trixie?

1366
01:28:17,899 --> 01:28:19,131
What would you like?

1367
01:28:19,133 --> 01:28:21,299
Bubbly, if you got.
(giggling)

1368
01:28:21,301 --> 01:28:23,467
Champagne, Hansen.

1369
01:28:23,469 --> 01:28:25,268
They told me you
had a wine cellar,

1370
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:27,103
But I didn't believe it.

1371
01:28:27,105 --> 01:28:28,771
Oh, um, hardly a cellar.

1372
01:28:28,773 --> 01:28:32,107
A bin, actually,
in the pantry.

1373
01:28:32,109 --> 01:28:36,044
You know, I never
did see a train
like this before.

1374
01:28:37,547 --> 01:28:37,978
(gasping)

1375
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:42,282
This is
the master bedroom.
Do you approve?

1376
01:28:42,284 --> 01:28:44,651
Oh, it's swell.
Oh.

1377
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:46,285
A regular Tintoretto.

1378
01:28:46,287 --> 01:28:49,388
Oh. Do you
like the bed?

1379
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:52,591
Oh, do
I like the bed?

1380
01:28:55,529 --> 01:28:59,097
Uh, that will be
all tonight.

1381
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:03,301
A little wine
with music.

1382
01:29:05,071 --> 01:29:07,304
Nineteenth century science.

1383
01:29:07,306 --> 01:29:09,906
(jazz music playing)

1384
01:29:13,244 --> 01:29:17,112
Stone age atmosphere.

1385
01:29:17,247 --> 01:29:20,214
Caveman passion!

1386
01:29:20,349 --> 01:29:22,382
(cocking gun)

1387
01:29:23,017 --> 01:29:25,317
My wallet is
in the top drawer.

1388
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:27,385
But you'll never get away
with this, Trixie.

1389
01:29:27,387 --> 01:29:30,921
My name isn't Trixie,
Sir Harry.
It's Catherine.

1390
01:29:30,923 --> 01:29:33,623
And I'm Frankie Ballou's
daughter.

1391
01:29:33,925 --> 01:29:37,259
So you're
Cat Ballou, hmm?

1392
01:29:37,561 --> 01:29:39,327
Sign this.

1393
01:29:39,329 --> 01:29:40,061
What is it?

1394
01:29:40,063 --> 01:29:42,930
A confession that
you ordered the hiring
of Tim Strawn,

1395
01:29:42,932 --> 01:29:45,732
And are responsible for
the murder of my father.

1396
01:29:45,734 --> 01:29:47,366
Sign it!

1397
01:29:49,036 --> 01:29:51,703
And if I refuse
to sign it?

1398
01:29:52,472 --> 01:29:54,205
I'll kill you.

1399
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:56,773
Now, why do I
doubt that?

1400
01:29:58,676 --> 01:30:01,009
Don't you doubt it,
Sir Harry.

1401
01:30:01,011 --> 01:30:01,776
But I do.

1402
01:30:01,778 --> 01:30:06,080
I don't think you have it
in you, Miss Ballou.

1403
01:30:06,148 --> 01:30:08,381
Give me that gun.

1404
01:30:10,785 --> 01:30:12,618
(gunshot)

1405
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:21,559
Group: <i> ♪  shall we</i>

1411
01:30:46,684 --> 01:30:48,950
Well, it's time.

1412
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:54,855
Come on, don't just dawdle.
Everybody's waiting.

1413
01:30:54,857 --> 01:30:55,488
Waiting?

1414
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:59,558
Oh. Looking forward to it,
I might say.

1415
01:31:00,394 --> 01:31:05,263
<i>♪ shall we gather</i>

1417
01:31:09,334 --> 01:31:11,400
I'm sorry
they don't like me.

1418
01:31:11,402 --> 01:31:14,669
Well, you can't
blame them, can you?

1419
01:31:14,671 --> 01:31:15,736
Killing Sir Harry
put the kibosh

1420
01:31:15,738 --> 01:31:19,106
On the whole
slaughterhouse, didn't it?

1421
01:31:19,108 --> 01:31:21,141
No jobs. No payroll.

1422
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:26,513
You took the bread
out of half the mouths
of Wolf City.

1423
01:31:26,515 --> 01:31:28,581
You haven't got
a friend in the world.

1424
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:29,548
You ready, reverend?

1425
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:32,017
Reverend:
Hallelujah, brothers!

1426
01:31:32,019 --> 01:31:34,252
I am here to
comfort the sinner

1427
01:31:34,254 --> 01:31:36,787
And return the
stray lamb to the fold.

1428
01:31:36,789 --> 01:31:37,621
Let them what's troubled,

1429
01:31:37,623 --> 01:31:40,290
Let them what's
vexed of mind, take heart.

1430
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:44,494
There are many good
things that comfort in
the bible, sister.

1431
01:31:44,496 --> 01:31:45,828
Indeed, there are.

1432
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:49,631
It's a better world,
we're all bound for.

1433
01:31:49,633 --> 01:31:52,200
Where trouble don't
come around, sister.

1434
01:31:52,202 --> 01:31:54,135
And earthly care
is forgotten.

1435
01:31:54,137 --> 01:31:57,037
And greener pastures
await the tired sinner,

1436
01:31:57,039 --> 01:31:59,305
And honey flows
like water.

1437
01:32:05,546 --> 01:32:07,846
(snoring)

1438
01:32:10,851 --> 01:32:16,955
Kid? Oh, kid,
what a time for you to
fall off the wagon.

1439
01:32:17,457 --> 01:32:19,156
Look at your eyes.

1440
01:32:19,658 --> 01:32:21,858
What's wrong
with my eyes?

1441
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:24,594
Well, they're red,
bloodshot.

1442
01:32:24,596 --> 01:32:28,097
You ought to see them
from my side.

1443
01:32:28,099 --> 01:32:30,732
We're counting
on you, kid.

1444

If you have
any last words,
say them now.

1454
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:35,691
Let's get on with it.

1455
01:33:37,061 --> 01:33:38,860
By virtue of
the authority vested in me,

1456
01:33:38,862 --> 01:33:41,562
I order this hanging
to proceed.

1457
01:34:11,393 --> 01:34:12,325

1458
01:34:12,327 --> 01:34:14,994

God bless you!

Yah!
Stop them!

1461
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,667
Where's Shelleen?
