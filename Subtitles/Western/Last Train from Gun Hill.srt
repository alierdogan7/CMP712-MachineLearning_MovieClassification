1
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,434
Where you going in such a hurry?

2
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,598
Come on, honey, not so fast, huh?
Slow down a little.

3
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,678
- Giddup!
- How about a drink, squaw-missy?

4
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,672
No!

5
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,589
Hi, Marshal!
Marshal Morgan!

6
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,756
- Marshal!
- Marshal!

7
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,916
Hey, what is this? A raid?

8
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,918
Where's Petey? He's not at the house.

9
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,078
At the reservation with his mother,
visiting her folks.

10
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,116
They'll be back this afternoon. Why?
Got a business deal cooking with Petey?

11
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,029
He was gonna show us the gun
you killed the Bradley boys with.

12
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,437
- He was, was he?
- And then how you did it.

13
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,712
- You've heard that story lots of times.
- You tell us.

14
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,753
- Come on, Mr Morgan!
- I got work to do.

15
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,428
- Come on!
- Come on!

16
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,234
All right! Come on.

17
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,479
What's this?

18
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,798
Feeding the kids hokey-pokey about
the old days. The Bradley Brothers.

19
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,310
I was at the window
when I first heard them, like this.

20
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,479
- That wasrt hokey-pokey.
- I don't think they believe half of it.

21
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,150
I opened the door very easy...

22
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,749
...very easy.

23
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,476
Where the ice-cream parlour is, there
used to be a dance hall, an evil place...

24
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,194
- Pink Poodle.
- That's right.

25
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,748
One of the Bradleys was up on the roof.
Jeb, over there with a shotgun.

26
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,919
And right across the street was Frank.
Boy, he was a real mean one!

27
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,271
Wish I'd been around in the olden times.

28
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,792
- Yes, those sure were the olden times.
- Must have been nine, ten years ago.

29
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,709
Don't even hear a gun
in the territory any more.

30
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,472
Be glad of that. Now, I was standing here
just so, my hands at my side.

31
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,958
And I tell you, I expected to hear
those guns go off any minute.

32
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,957
Bam! Bam!

33
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,152
- See those bullet holes?
- One was from Jeb Bradley.

34
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,955
- And the other from Frank.
- Now, don't go rushing me, boys.

35
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,919
Those Bradleys were a mean bunch.

36
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,069
- Then what'd you do, Marshal?
- Well, I tell you, sir, I drew.

37
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,236
Aimed...

38
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,834
What happened, son, tell me.

39
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,800
Here, calm down, son.
Here, tell your dad.

40
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,629
- Where's your mother?
- Back on the road.

41
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,195
What happened, Petey?

42
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,720
Andy, get some help!

43
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,236
Catherine!

44
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,996
Catherine!

45
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,674
Catherine!

46
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,591
CB

47
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,791
GUN HILL

48
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,236
Rick Belden! Where you been hiding
yourself, boy? Sure have missed you.

49
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,399
Is that right, Minnie? What did you miss
about me? I don't understand.

50
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,239
I don't have to draw no pictures for you.

51
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,797
- What happened to your face?
- Vamoose, Minnie. I'm busy right now.

52
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,959
Looks like somebody scratched you.
Somebody with long fingernails.

53
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,912
I told you to go.

54
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,591
Does me good to see somebody scratch
you for a change. It's nice and deep.

55
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,154
- I said mind your own business.
- That's no way to treat a girl.

56
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,669
- What else you got to say?
- Hold it...

57
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,111
Something to say?
Anybody got something to say, say it!

58
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,596
All right. Come on, kid, let's go.

59
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,994
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

60
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,553
It's your pappy.

61
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,433
You borrowed something
of his and didn't return it.

62
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,713
Let's go. Your pappy's mighty
unappy about you, boy.

63
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,717
All right. Now, tell me again.
How did he lose it?

64
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,914
We stopped for a beer, Mr Belden.
Somebody must have thieved the horses.

65
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,671
- While you was having your beer, right?
- That's how it looks, Mr Belden.

66
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,953
- What town did you say this was?
- Pawley. You know Pawley, Mr Belden.

67
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,911
Oh yes, yes, I know Pawley. Ain't been
a horse stole in Pawley in ten years.

68
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,070
- They're very civilised in Pawley.
- Somebody didn't know the rules.

69
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,750
- Here he is, Mr Belden.
- Hey, hey, hiya, boy!

70
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,234
Hey, Pa!

71
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,670
- Have a nice trip?
- Fine.

72
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,997
Hear you came by train.
Where are the horses?

73
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,919
- I don't know.
- Lee says they got stole. Right?

74
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,911
- Yes. We was having a beer in Pawley.
- You took my saddle. Is that stole, too?

75
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,588
Yes, sir.

76
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,756
That saddle means a lot to me.

77
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,269
- Yes, sir, I know.
- I want it back.

78
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,598
I figured I could pay you for it. You can
take it out of my wages every month.

79
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,872
I don't want the money,
I want that saddle!

80
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,039
Anybody else take my saddle, get it stole,
you know what I'd do?

81
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,800
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

82
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,195
- What's that on your face?
- Nothing.

83
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,834
- Come here, let me look.
- Ain't nothing.

84
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,996
What do you mean?

85
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,829
Hey, that looks like a scratch, huh?

86
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,553
- Take a she-bear to lay a welt that deep.
- Yeah.

87
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,639
- One of those she-bears over in Pawley.
- Yeah, yeah.

88
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,549
You know, Rick would do better
fighting with men.

89
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,196
- Did you hear what Beero said?
- Yes, sir.

90
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,029
You gonna let him talk like that?
Man, I'd hit him.

91
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,836
He's just joking, Pa.

92
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,830
What's your name? Come on, boy,
what's your name? What? I can't hear.

93
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,793
- Belden.
- Then be a Belden! Hit him!

94
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,510
No man jokes like that with a Belden!
Now, you hit him!

95
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,234
- Beero.
- Yes, Beero!

96
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,399
If you don't, I'll knock you
right through that wall. Hit him.

97
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,751
Beero, don't you pull your punches.

98
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,396
That's enough!
Come on, son, get up.

99
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,556
Get up.

100
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,716
Get out.

101
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,789
Rick, I told you before,
somebody insults you, you hit him!

102
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,549
I don't care if you win or lose,
but you fight, understand?

103
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,230
Sure, Pa, I understand.

104
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,997
So, you got mixed up with a...
a she-bear, huh?

105
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,156
Yeah.

106
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,631
Rick!

107
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,071
I want that saddle
and the man who stole it.

108
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,355
- Petey all right?
- Yeah. He's asleep now.

109
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,237
You and I track them from the wagon,
from where they killed my daughter.

110
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,194
We find them, even if they gone
to Mexico, we find them.

111
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,391
Don't have to, Keno.

112
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,273
I know who this saddle belongs to.

113
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,278
- Who?
- Belden.

114
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,550
- Craig Belden?
- Yeah.

115
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,116
Then we call the sheriff at Gun Hill
and have him hold him.

116
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,312
I know Belden better than I know you.

117
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,751
I used to work with him, ride with him.

118
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,829
He saved my life once. He'd never
get mixed up in a thing like this.

119
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,713
- We'd still better call the sheriff.
- Sit down.

120
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,311
Belden must have 20 or 30 men
riding for him. Could be any one of them.

121
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:45,757
I'm gonna deliver a saddle. Andy, get me
a ticket on the train to Gun Hill.

122
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,191
- I go with you.
- No, Keno.

123
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,755
I don't want you mixed up in this.

124
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,236
I go. She was my daughter!

125
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,590
She was my wife.

126
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,997
Kill him. Kill him slow. The Indian way.

127
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,515
I'll kill him... my own way.

128
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,954
- This is the car?
- That's right, lady.

129
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,792
- Sorry, but those are the rules.
- Right here! Been saving it just for you.

130
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,079
- Pardon me.
- Oh, no, thank you.

131
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,238
- Would you mind lighting it for me?
- No.

132
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,834
Thank you.

133
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,430
That's a mighty handsome saddle
you have there.

134
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,473
- How far you travelling, mister?
- Gun Hill.

135
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,549
Oh. I live there.
I've been to Laredo, in a hospital.

136
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,115
Have you ever been in a hospital?

137
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,197
No.

138
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,708
You married?

139
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,480
Sure you are. You got the look.

140
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:48,312
I can always tell the ones
that are married. You got any kids?

141
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,988
- One.
- Boy or girl?

142
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,078
- Boy.
- Ah, that's nice.

143
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,750
Say, what are you going to Gun Hill for?

144
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,758
I guess it's none of my business, huh?

145
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,799
If you don't wanna talk,
why don't you just say so?

146
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,151
- It's just that I don't feel like talking.
- All right.

147
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,549
It's not a good idea
to carry a gun where you're going.

148
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,719
I don't know who you are,
but you see, I know who that belongs to.

149
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,835
So do I.

150
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,269
- Hello, Linda.
- Hello. Where's Mr Belden?

151
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,869
He couldn't come.

152
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,112
I'll handle this. Take her out to the ranch.

153
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,551
I'm not going to the ranch.
Take me to the Harper House.

154
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,753
- Mr Belden won't like that.
- Take care of her. I'll tell Mr Belden.

155
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,632
All right.

156
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,389
- Whers the night train for Pawley?
- Last trairs at nine o'clock.

157
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,716
Thank you.

158
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,155
You work for Craig Belden?

159
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,352
You tell him I'm coming.

160
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,790
'Board!

161
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,239
- Do you know where I can hire a rig?
- Yeah. Right at the end of the street.

162
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,396
Thank you.

163
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,958
BELDEN CATTLE COMPANY

164
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,753
He showed up. The horse thief.

165
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,398
- He did, huh? Where?
- At the station, and he's got your saddle.

166
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,672
- You talk to him?
- He said to tell you he's coming.

167
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:53,557
He did, huh? Where's Linda?
Was she on the train?

168
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,878
She wouldn't come out here.
She went to the Harper House.

169
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,517
- Harper House? Why?
- I don't know, Mr Belden.

170
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,468
Well, let's take care of this fellow
with the saddle first.

171
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,717
Probably fixing to collect himself
a little reward.

172
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,593
Well, he'll get it. He'll get it.

173
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,598
- Take this saddle into the harness room.
- You need me, Mr Belden?

174
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,360
Have it cleaned up.

175
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,951
Matt?

176
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,434
Hello, Craig.

177
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,954
Matt Morgan! You old... And I was
coming up here to shellac a horse thief.

178
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,118
- I wouldn't take $1 million for this.
- I brought your saddle.

179
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,438
- I see you did. Where'd you find it?
- A long ways from home. Pawley.

180
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,835
- Catch the thieves?
- I will.

181
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,511
Ah, that'll keep. Come on in.
We got a lot of drinking to catch up on.

182
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,273
- A lot of years, Craig.
- Yeah.

183
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,395
Well, how do you like it, huh?
Not bad for an old saddle tramp.

184
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,115
- You haven't changed, except for this.
- Yeah.

185
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,030
Aw, the heck with it. Here.
We'll drink to old times and friendship.

186
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,233
You know, I don't think I've made
a friend since you and me split up.

187
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,228
I've... I've bought a few, though.
Come on, sit down.

188
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,151
Hey... who'd ever think
that you'd turn out to be a marshal?

189
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,432
I finally figured out
the other side didn't pay.

190
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,392
To the law.

191
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,992
Matt.

192
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,719
I wish you'd joined me when I wanted
you to. I've got these parts sewed up.

193
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,912
I'll tell you what,
you can still be a partner.

194
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,669
- No, thanks. I like what I'm doing.
- Yeah?

195
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,034
I got this whole spread, I got nobody left
but Rick. That's my boy. My wife died.

196
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,516
- I didn't know.
- Nine years ago. That's the way it goes.

197
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,475
You work all your life for something and
then the reason you wanted it is gone.

198
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:02,232
- Here, let me give you another drink.
- Craig, tell me about that saddle.

199
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,992
Rick borrowed it. He was going
to Dodge City, he and his friend Lee.

200
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,430
They stopped at Pawley for a drink.

201
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,838
When they come out, the horses
was gone and my saddle, too.

202
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,956
- What day was that?
- Let me see, that was last Sunday.

203
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,790
- That's the day my wife was killed.
- Your wife?

204
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,556
Those fellas that got your saddle
murdered my wife.

205
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,435
- That's why I want them.
- Gee, I'm sorry, Matt.

206
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,394
Here I been talking about
a couple of damn horses.

207
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,594
No wonder you're after them. Anything
you need, you know where to come.

208
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,074
I'll ride with you.

209
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,593
You know, I was in my office
straight through the day that it happened.

210
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,156
It's funny your son didn't report
those stolen horses.

211
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,195
Probably never thought to. Nobody here
goes to a marshal, they all come to me.

212
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,597
- Yeah.
- Do you have anything to go on?

213
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,758
They could walk in here,
you wouldn't know them.

214
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,556
I wouldn't know them both, but...
I'd know one of them.

215
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,558
Well, that's better. How?

216
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,958
My wife got him across the face
with the lash. Petey was there.

217
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,230
Petey?

218
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,829
I got a son, too.

219
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,998
Nine years old and he was there, Craig.

220
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,512
Petey says she laid his cheek
open to the bone.

221
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,160
Well, that's something.

222
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,318
You know, a cut like that
would leave a mark for quite some time.

223
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,318
Yeah, I guess it would.

224
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,239
I think I'd better have a talk
with your son Rick and his friend.

225
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,514
Well, they're not here. They couldn't
tell you any different than they told me.

226
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,714
They was in a bar in Pawley,
and their animals got stole, that's all.

227
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,232
- Is that what your boy told you?
- Well, that's what they both told me.

228
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,228
- Which one's got the cut, Craig?
- What?

229
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,353
The mark where my wife lashed him
before they raped and murdered her.

230
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,950
- What are you talking about?
- Your son. He's a liar.

231
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,355
- Matt...
- He's a liar!

232
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,678
We got two saloons in Pawley.
They're both closed on Sunday.

233
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,077
Maybe I got it wrong.
Maybe it wasrt Sunday. How do I...?

234
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,352
Which one's got the cut, Craig?

235
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,516
It was your boy, wasrt it?

236
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,029
- No, Matt.
- Wasrt it?

237
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,279
- No, Matt, it wasrt.
- I'll find out, Craig.

238
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,153
If it takes me years, I'll find him.

239
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,272
And he'll still have that cut.

240
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,830
Suppose I could locate them for you?

241
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,636
I'd take them both back to Pawley.
They'll stand trial for rape and murder.

242
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,949
Matt, you're my best friend.
I'd do anything in the world for you.

243
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,914
But leave that boy alone.
This is my son you're talking about.

244
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,751
- No. It's my wife we're talking about.
- You don't lay a finger on that boy!

245
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,717
You're leaving on the next train. I own
the sheriff, this town and every man in it.

246
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,878
You're leaving on the next train, Matt.

247
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,875
All right, Craig, the last train leaves
at nine o'clock. I'll be on it.

248
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,950
But there'll be two men with me, and
one of them'll have a cut on his cheek.

249
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,358
Beero!

250
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,720
- Sheriff Bartlett?
- Why do you want him?

251
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,515
I've got two John Doe warrants
to serve here.

252
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,430
- It's customary to tell the local officer.
- It won't be necessary in this case.

253
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,029
It's customary to cooperate...

254
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,199
We've got our own customaries.
Anyway, the sheriff ain't around.

255
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,154
- Whers he coming back?
- He ain't coming back.

256
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,593
- What are you? Deputy?
- Don't matter much what you call me.

257
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,669
- I'm calling you yellow.
- It's your privilege.

258
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,957
I'm all for law and order, Marshal,
but a lawmars gotta take the long view.

259
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,358
You see that big hotel up the end
of the street? Owned by Mr Belden.

260
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,792
Those cattle pens by the tracks
east of town? Belden and Son.

261
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,994
He owns the livery stable, two saloons.
Some say he owns the Town Council.

262
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,228
So, like I tell you, a lawmars
gotta take the long view.

263
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,355
Far as I'm concerned, you can go and
get yourself killed any time you want.

264
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,269
40 years on, weeds'll grow as pretty
on my grave as on yours.

265
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,871
And nobody'll even remember that I was
yellow, or that you died like a fool.

266
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,312
That's your long view, son.
Always take the long view.

267
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,957
I've got two warrants and I'm serving
them. I'm leaving town with two men.

268
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,476
And the long view is this:
Don't try to stop me.

269
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,398
- You lied to me about that saddle.
- Now, wait a minute, Pa.

270
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,160
- You lied.
- Listen, Mr Belden...

271
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,432
I listened to you before.

272
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,393
And you lied to me, both of you.

273
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,831
We were scared.
You know I wouldn't lie to you.

274
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,352
- You got plenty of reason to be scared.
- What are you talking about, Pa?

275
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,552
You know damn well
what I'm talking about!

276
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,639
That woman up in Pawley?

277
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,389
We didn't mean to hurt her, Pa.
Honest we didn't.

278
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,196
We were just trying
to have a little fun, that's all.

279
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,915
You said there ain't nothing prettier
than a Cherokee squaw.

280
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,910
It was an accident, Pa. She must have
hit her head on a rock or something.

281
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,750
- You know who that woman was?
- Nobody. I'll take an oath on that.

282
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,951
Just an Indian squaw.

283
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,756
Get out of here before I kill you.

284
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,039
You keep your won'thless butt
off my property, you hear!

285
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,396
Rick!

286
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,156
- I thought I made a man out of you.
- It wasrt my fault. It was nobody's fault.

287
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,269
What are you making a fuss about?
She was just a squaw.

288
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,476
I'll tell you who she was.
That was Matt Morgars wife!

289
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,629
You know what I think of Morgan.
You've heard me talk about him enough.

290
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,196
- That was my friend's wife you killed!
- It was an accident!

291
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,358
He's come for you
with a hanging warrant.

292
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,189
If I was Matt, I wouldn't serve
that warrant. I'd kill you.

293
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,278
- I can take care of myself.
- Yeah, you can!

294
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,508
I know how to handle a gun, and I ain't
running away. I'm going in to town.

295
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,837
- Take Beero and Skag!
- I don't need bodyguards.

296
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,999
Think you're up against some field hand?
It's Matt Morgan. Do as I say.

297
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,590
And don't you do a thing till I get there.

298
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,360
Beero! Skag! Get in here!

299
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,597
- What'll happen to Lee?
- He'll be drunk in an hour.

300
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,997
I gotta tell you something, Pa.
It wasrt Lee's fault.

301
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,159
He'll be drunk in an hour.
If Matt finds him, he'll be dead in two.

302
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,715
I just hope that eases Matt's hurt.

303
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,832
I'm looking for Rick Belden.
Do you know where I can find him?

304
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,794
- What do you want him for, Marshal?
- To talk to him and Lee.

305
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,515
- Never heard of them.
- Maybe you got the wrong town.

306
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,314
No, I got the right town.

307
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,798
- Maybe I'm talking to the wrong people.
- That's the only kind we got.

308
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,276
Before we're through,
you're gonna have two less.

309
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,994
That's right nasty of you, Marshal.

310
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,714
We heard talk about an Indian girl...

311
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,959
Hereabouts we don't arrest a man for
killing an Indian. We give him a bounty.

312
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,719
What'll it be, Marshal?

313
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,719
Whiskey.

314
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,115
It's none of my business,
but I've some free advice...

315
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,312
- Get out of town?
- That's right.

316
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,069
- How much?
- It's on the house, just like the advice.

317
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,995
You wouldn't know where to find them?

318
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,957
If they was standing right next to you,
I wouldn't tell you. I've got a family.

319
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,720
Yeah, I can understand that.

320
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,874
Isn't anybody here not afraid of Belden?

321
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,072
Sure, the graveyard's full of them.

322
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,635
I'm not afraid of Craig Belden.

323
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,480
- What are you doing in a place like this?
- I was raised in places like this.

324
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,636
That makes two of us.

325
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,037
They're saying
you're gonna get yourself killed.

326
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,789
- Is that what they say?
- It's what they say.

327
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,880
Just like Jimmy.

328
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:49,200
A fella I used to know. Just like you.
Always wanted to make everything right.

329
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,076
He had a heart as big as a house
and a brain the size of a pea.

330
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,435
You don't know where Rick Belden is?

331
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,949
No.

332
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,754
But I know where I'd look.

333
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,748
- Where?
- That gin mill across the street.

334
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,670
It's called Charlie's Place,
but Craig Belden counts the cash.

335
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,154
Thanks.

336
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,878
If any of the girls try and tell you how
wonderful you are, don't believe them.

337
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,514
I know, I used to deal there.

338
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,110
Just like Jimmy, stubborn as a mule.

339
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,677
Next time you see Jimmy, say hello.
We seem to have a lot in common.

340
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,237
Maybe more than you know. He's dead.
They shot him down in the street.

341
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,594
Six, deuce, pair of fives...

342
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,199
...ten, three.

343
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,152
- You're high, Charlie.
- $5.

344
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,071
I'll call.

345
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,238
- Six. Where you going, Rick?
- I'll be back.

346
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,319
- He's fixing to get scratched again.
- Pair of tens.

347
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,797
- Can't a girl get some sleep?
- Sorry. Don't make any noise.

348
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,234
Rick, what are you doing up there?

349
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,193
Will you let him alone, Skag?

350
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,191
Come on, Rick! We're fixing to shoot
a little red dog. We need your money!

351
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,354
All right, everybody up.

352
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,839
Just keep away from those guns.

353
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,555
All right, on your feet.

354
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,595
All right, one at a time. In there.

355
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,757
Start moving.

356
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,070
Morgan, you must be out of your mind.

357
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,236
Get in there.

358
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,436
I need one of your jail cells
until train time, Sheriff.

359
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,031
The cells are all locked.
I wouldn't know where to find the keys.

360
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,909
Pretty bad bump you put on that
boy's head. Mr Belden ain't gonna like it.

361
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,274
He's got plenty of time to handle it.
Evening train ain't due for six hours.

362
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,234
You'll never get him on it.
You've been lucky so far, Morgan.

363
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,396
The tough part's still ahead.

364
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,311
You'll turn this into a shooting gallery!
Get out!

365
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,876
- I want a room.
- Not here. Mr Belders the owner.

366
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,435
You're breaking the law!

367
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,154
I am the law.

368
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,749
Morgars got your boy, Mr Belden.

369
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:23,269
Don't worry, I've never killed
an unarmed man in my life.

370
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,038
Or a woman.

371
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,199
He got him, Mr Belden.
He's up in that far room.

372
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,756
He jumped us. Rick was upstairs.
Morgan came down with him, out cold.

373
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,436
Cover the place.

374
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,632
Rick! Can you hear me?

375
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,514
Yeah, Pa!

376
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,349
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, Pa!

377
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,317
Matt!

378
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,514
- Matt! I wanna come up!
- You got something to say, say it!

379
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,157
I told you to leave town!
Are you tired of living or just plain crazy?

380
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,069
I've got 20 men down here!
You turn Rick loose!

381
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,716
You know the answer to that.

382
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,836
He's cuffed me to the bed!

383
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,119
- Matt, now, this is your last chance!
- You through?

384
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,995
All right. All right, you called the turn.

385
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,077
Do me a favour, will you? Try walking
in front of that window again.

386
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,679
Hey!

387
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,393
No!

388
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:38,230
Pa, make them stop! He's got the bed
in front of the window! Pa!

389
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,476
Hold it!

390
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,069
- Arert you gonna do anything?
- Why don't we rush him?

391
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,239
- After all, he's only one man.
- That's my son up there.

392
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,833
That's better. Not so noisy.

393
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,112
You're a goner, Morgan.

394
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,834
I know my old man.

395
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,237
Only way you'll get out of here's in a box.

396
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:43,434
Just so long as I got you with me,
that's the main thing.

397
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,759
- He can't stay holed up.
- Sooner or later, he'll have to come out.

398
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,234
- Charlie!
- Yeah?

399
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:07,390
- Get Doc Rainey, huh? Where's Skag?
- He couldn't make it back.

400
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,112
Why don't he have sense and quit?
He don't stand a chance in hell.

401
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,754
Rushing him don't do no good.

402
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,919
- Where are the other men?
- Over at the Horseshoe.

403
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,839
No, you wait. Soon they'll be stampeding
in here to get liquored up.

404
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:38,079
Killing, blood, a good gunfight,
makes them thirsty.

405
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,556
You'd think they'd be buying already.
Two men dead.

406
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,356
- Three. You're forgetting Skag.
- That wasrt a man.

407
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:51,076
But Matt Morgan. You've got to admire
somebody with that much guts.

408
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,032
OK, OK.

409
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,840
You look kind of Ionesome, missy.

410
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,793
Not since I was 12 years old.

411
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,514
Like to buy you a little drink.

412
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,995
Later, missy, later.

413
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,474
- Hey, you think Morgarll really make it?
- No. I wish he would, though.

414
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,911
- I'd love to see Craig's face.
- Yeah.

415
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,917
I'll tell you,

416
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:37,477
if Morgan does manage to get the kid
out of here, it could really hurt Craig.

417
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,433
Probably the only thing that would.

418
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,915
- Where are you going?
- My room.

419
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,759
What? In the Harper House?

420
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,316
The hotel where this Morgars holed up?
You going in there?

421
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,353
- Why not? I live there.
- She's just pulling your leg.

422
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,597
She may walk in that lobby,
but not up them stairs.

423
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,635
- You know you're not going in there.
- Would you like to put money on it?

424
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:06,551
I got $100 that says I not only go up, but
walk into Morgars room and talk to him.

425
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,389
- I'll take half that bet.
- How about you, big mouth?

426
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:15,913
Well, of all the stubborn women,
you take the cake. All right.

427
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,749
- Who'll hold the bet?
- Put it in the cash register.

428
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,631
Linda!

429
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,951
Why didn't you come back to the ranch?

430
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,119
- So you could beat me up again?
- What did you expect after all I heard?

431
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:54,917
Rick told you those things. Rick hates
me. He always has and you know it.

432
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,476
When he tells you lies about me,
why believe him?

433
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,116
Why couldn't you just once believe me?

434
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,710
- 'Cause he's my son.
- What am I? Nothing?

435
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:13,076
- You know better than that.
- It's not gonna be that way any more.

436
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,715
- What are you talking about?
- Ten days I lay in that hospital.

437
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,995
Every day I swore that we were through.
I was through with this town and you.

438
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,760
But you came back.

439
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:36,998
You told me something once.
You said you'd marry me.

440
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,955
- Will you marry me?
- We can't discuss that now.

441
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,755
- You know how Rick feels...
- Rick! Rick!

442
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,520
- I've got my answer.
- Where are you going?

443
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,473
The hotel. To get a job,
I have to dress the part.

444
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,195
You ain't going back to work.
You don't leave me till I say.

445
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,679
- You'll do nothing until this is over.
- All right, but just until this is over.

446
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,874
What's this about you talking to Morgan?
Do you know him?

447
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,594
Yes. I met him on the train.

448
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:17,510
Linda, Morgan was my closest friend.
Now, I don't wanna see him killed.

449
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,837
But he's come for Rick.
No mars taking my son from me.

450
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,669
The only way he'll get out of here alive
is if I get Rick back.

451
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:30,034
Linda, you go up there and you...
you talk to him. Maybe he'll listen to you.

452
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:35,598
Tell him I don't wanna kill him. He ain't
got a chance. He's just being stubborn.

453
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,190
You need me now, don't you?

454
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,036
Linda, you do this for me now, will you?

455
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,798
Please.

456
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:51,433
I never thought I'd live
to hear you use that word, Craig.

457
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,712
- 204, please.
- You can't go up there, miss.

458
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,878
- You know who I am?
- Yes, ma'am.

459
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,277
Do you wanna explain it to Mr Belden?

460
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,676
Thank you.

461
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,239
<i>It's me, Marshal, Linda.</i>

462
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,393
- Don't shoot.
- What do you want?

463
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,433
We're neighbours. I live across the hall.

464
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,189
Linda, honey,
give me a cigarette, will you?

465
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,959
Well, it looks like you've been
having yourself a time, Marshal.

466
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:28,517
Hold it. Keep away from that window.
You wanna get shot?

467
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,280
They can tell between you and me.

468
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,550
Tell Pa I'm tired of waiting.

469
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,752
Maybe Mr Morgars tired of waiting, too.

470
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,918
No, he's just tired of living.

471
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,029
You better get going.

472
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,396
Marshal.

473
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:09,077
You can get out of this if you want to.
You just have to turn that kid loose.

474
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,236
Yeah, I know.

475
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,274
There's a drainpipe at the back.
You could shinny down it.

476
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,311
No, thanks.

477
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,476
Well...

478
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:34,790
I didn't really have to change.
It was kind of a bet.

479
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,278
I don't know. Seemed like a funny,
wild thing to do at the time.

480
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,830
Listen, Linda...

481
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,996
...I need help.

482
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,590
- You sure do.
- I know it's a big thing, but...

483
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,349
Don't listen, Linda!
Don't listen to nothing he says!

484
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,438
What is it you want, Marshal?

485
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,670
- I need a shotgun.
- A shotgun?

486
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,032
- A pistol's not enough for this.
- But I can't...

487
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:13,153
Please. If you want to help me,
that's what I need.

488
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,949
I can't. I'm too selfish
to stick my neck out.

489
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:27,076
I'm not like you.
I don't wanna die for law and order.

490
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,311
- I'm sorry, I really am.
- It's all right. I understand.

491
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,352
Linda, don't you go mixing in this!

492
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,755
Oh, shut up!

493
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,471
Oh, Miss Linda, did Rick say anything?

494
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,433
He asked for a cigarette.

495
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,313
I didn't give him one.

496
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:00,158
All right, you changed your dress.
Now prove you were with Morgan.

497
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,670
We watched out the window,
didn't see nothing.

498
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,839
You keep the money.
It wasrt a decent thing to bet on anyway.

499
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,878
What's the matter?

500
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:28,319
Oh, that poor fool up there in that hotel
room with his high-flown ideals,

501
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:33,389
a whole town standing around
waiting to see him get killed.

502
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,115
Not one of them'll put out
a helping hand to him.

503
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:42,075
- Including me.
- Why would you go against Belden?

504
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:46,592
You talk as though he's some sort
of god. He isn't. He's a man.

505
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,155
Just like that one up in that room.

506
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:56,555
Here. I've got the man that can prove
whether she was there. Here he is.

507
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,638
- You seen Rick? You was in the room?
- Yes.

508
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:05,473
- You notice anything new about him?
- He has a scar right here.

509
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,158
She was up there.

510
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,878
Hey! Does Morgan still think
he can take me?

511
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,595
He'd better not try.

512
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,190
Is he the man who was with Rick
at the killing?

513
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,674
Yeah.

514
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,038
Lee.

515
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,713
Let me buy you a drink.

516
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,238
Some whiskey for the...

517
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,431
...gentleman, Steve.

518
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,873
Lee...

519
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,876
...tell me what happened.

520
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,031
Far as we could see,
she was just an Indian squaw.

521
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,630
How did we know it was Morgars wife?

522
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,679
Morgan ain't gonna take me back.
He ain't even gonna take Rick back.

523
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:26,317
- You're gonna stop him?
- It could be done, lady, it could be done.

524
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:31,196
If he won't come out and fight like a man,
there are ways to make him come out.

525
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,836
I could do it.
How about buying me another drink?

526
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,873
You can have mine.

527
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,030
You all right, Linda?

528
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,629
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

529
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,872
Matt?

530
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,358
Matt!

531
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,436
I'm coming up.

532
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,876
Jake. Henry.

533
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,753
Drop your gun, Craig.

534
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,479
- How can we settle this?
- The law's gotta settle it, not us.

535
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:58,832
I saved your life once. You owe me that.
You owe me one life.

536
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:03,511
I remember you saved my life.
But he took a life.

537
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:08,555
- He killed a woman! For the fun of it!
- Taking him won't bring your wife back.

538
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:12,435
My wife or somebody else's,
makes no difference.

539
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,349
I took an oath. The oath says
bring him in, that's what I'll do.

540
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,677
What do you want me to do?
You want me to beg?

541
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,316
All right, Matt, I'll beg. He's all I got.

542
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,918
Matt, maybe it was my fault.

543
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:31,829
It ain't easy to raise a boy
without a mother.

544
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,429
Yeah, I know, Craig.

545
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:41,872
What about Petey? You ain't getting out
of this alive. Now, you know that.

546
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,117
He'll be an orphan.
You thought about that?

547
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,835
You've already got me dead.
How did I die?

548
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:53,591
The only way I could die today is for
you to kill me, and that's your problem.

549
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,759
He's crazy. He don't care what happens
to him. Stop the talking and get me out.

550
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,916
Now, you just shut up.

551
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:04,910
I've tried to reason with you, Matt.
You just won't listen.

552
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:09,033
What happens from now on
is your doing, Matt.

553
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,794
I ought to kill you for that.

554
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,436
Why don't you? Why don't you kill me?

555
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,276
You saved my life. I've paid you back.

556
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,870
But from here on in,
they're all free shots.

557
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,952
Get out of here, Craig.

558
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,714
- Get me out of here, Pa.
- Take it easy. I'll get you out.

559
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,798
Steve, have you got another tablet?
My head's killing me.

560
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,956
Yeah, sure.

561
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,474
Here they are.

562
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:42,629
Hey, Morgan. You still figuring
to make the nine o'clock train?

563
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:49,351
Have to make your move pretty soon.

564
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,120
What time you got now?

565
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:59,990
How you gonna get me to the station?
Carry this bed?

566
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,909
Your father told you to shut up.
That was good advice.

567
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:09,672
You ain't gonna make it, Morgan.
Your son Petey's gonna be an orphan.

568
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,593
How'd I know she was your wife?
It ain't my fault you married a squaw!

569
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:32,119
It don't take no guts to kill a man
when he's cuffed.

570
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,276
It takes guts not to.

571
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,109
Be too easy on you.
You'd die too quick.

572
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:43,838
I know an old man who'd like to kill you,
Belden. The Indian way. Slow.

573
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,795
And that's how I'm going to do it.
Slow. But the white mars way.

574
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,995
First you'll stand trial.

575
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:57,352
That takes a fair amount of time,
and you'll do a lot of sweating.

576
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,949
Then they'll sentence you.

577
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:05,757
I've never seen a man who wasrt sick
when he heard the sentence you'll draw.

578
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,599
After that, you'll sit in a cell and wait.

579
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:13,351
Maybe for months, thinking how
that rope'll feel around your neck.

580
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:18,839
Then they'll come around
some cold morning, just before sun-up.

581
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:25,275
They'll tie your arms behind you. You'll
start blubbering, kicking, yelling for help.

582
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,948
But it won't do you any good.

583
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:33,078
They'll drag you out to that platform,
fix that rope around your neck

584
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:39,150
and leave you out there all alone
with a big black hood over your eyes.

585
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,920
You know the last sound you hear?

586
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,396
A thump when they kick the catch
and down you go.

587
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:50,116
You'll hit the end of that rope like a sack
of potatoes, all dead weight.

588
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,279
It'll be white hot around your neck.
Your Adam's apple'll turn to mush.

589
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,995
You'll fight for breath,
but you haven't got any.

590
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:04,992
Your brairll begin to boil. You'll scream
and holler, but nobody'll hear you.

591
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,475
You'll hear it...

592
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,671
...but nobody else.

593
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:16,954
Finally, you're just swinging there,
all alone and dead.

594
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,079
What are you doing back here?

595
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:09,792
It's loaded. It's just a sawed-off, but it's
the only thing I could get my hands on.

596
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:15,516
This is gonna mean
a lot of trouble for you.

597
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,439
I've been in trouble since
the day I was born, Matt.

598
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,912
I'm sorry.

599
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,588
I heard about your wife.
Lee Smithers told me.

600
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:30,389
- Where is he?
- He's in the bar. You can't get him.

601
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,154
I'll come back for him.

602
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,316
Why don't you give up?

603
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,514
- You don't understand me.
- I understand you'll get killed!

604
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:47,157
You should see those people lined up
in the street, waiting to see it happen.

605
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:52,912
The human race stinks. I'm practically
an authority on that subject.

606
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,278
You must have loved her very much.

607
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,238
You... you'd better get out of here now.

608
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,598
Good luck to you, Matt Morgan.

609
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,236
Thanks, Linda.

610
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,273
All right, Beero. Get in back.

611
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,429
- Let me go!
- Dawson!

612
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,232
Let me go!

613
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:33,953
Dawson!

614
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,116
Let go of me!

615
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,715
She took a gun up to Morgan!
A shotgun!

616
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,878
Yes, sir, Mr Belden. I... I saw.

617
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,714
Linda?

618
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,480
I hope he makes it.

619
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,309
- Linda...
- I really do. I'm praying for it!

620
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,794
Linda...

621
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,276
<i>Mr Belden, the hotel caught fire!</i>
<i>The back's burning!</i>

622
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,869
<i>Let's get those water buckets!</i>

623
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,193
- How did it start?
- Somebody set it to get him out.

624
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,312
- What fool did that?
- Luke! Jake!

625
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,273
- Get buckets.
- Form a brigade.

626
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,150
Rick!

627
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,074
Matt, I'll make you pay for this.

628
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:18,749
One shot, Craig, just one...
and I'll blow his head off.

629
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,718
Get out ahead of me.

630
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,751
Tell your men not to use their guns!

631
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:50,397
They may get me, but one twitch
on this trigger is all it takes.

632
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,309
Don't shoot!

633
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:03,399
Sheriff, untie the horse.

634
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,749
Do what he says.

635
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,394
Untie the horse, Bartlett.

636
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:49,793
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing now. Wait.

637
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,390
Another block and he'll be at the station.

638
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,832
Don't you worry, Rick!
I'll get you out of this!

639
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,760
- Who's that?
- Smithers.

640
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,675
I hope your friend
doesn't try anything foolish.

641
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:39,916
- All right, Morgan, you can stop there!
- Lee, don't start nothing.

642
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,678
Don't worry.

643
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:45,156
- Morgan, I was in on it. Wanna draw?
- Lee, don't!

644
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,509
- You damn fool! Get away!
- Stay out of this!

645
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:55,429
You had your chance!
Come on, Morgan, draw!

646
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,590
- Morgan, draw!
- Lee, don't!

647
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,995
- Come on!
- Lee, don't!

648
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,711
Rick!

649
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:47,036
Rick! Rick!

650
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:50,118
Rick, no! No, Rick!

651
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,198
Rick.

652
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,392
Dead.

653
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,074
Matt!

654
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,877
- It's all over.
- No, it's not, Matt.

655
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,513
It's over.

656
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,751
I told you I was gonna kill you.

657
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,599
Now I'm gonna do it. Draw!

658
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,755
Don't try me. Please.

659
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,319
Draw!

660
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:02,118
All right, Craig.
If that's the way you want it.

661
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,554
That's the way I want it.

662
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,514
You draw.

663
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,159
Craig...

664
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,876
Matt...

665
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:46,195
What was your boy's name, Matt?

666
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,958
Petey.

667
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,559
Petey.

668
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,833
That's right, Petey.

669
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:58,393
Raise him good, Matt.
