1
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:40,159
In 1862, the first
trans-continental railroad

2
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:44,644
triggered a rush of
white settlers heading West.

3
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:48,680
They all rushed into the land
that once belonged to the indians.

4
00:00:48,727 --> 00:00:52,800
It was at this time that Ranger,
a white Southerner,

5
00:00:52,847 --> 00:00:56,840
rescued Abahachi,
chief of the Apache,

6
00:00:56,887 --> 00:01:00,880
at an unguarded rail road crossing.
Apache customs demanded

7
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:04,920
they become blood brothers.
They had no choice.

8
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:09,438
Abahachi and Ranger did
what tradition called for.

9
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:30,635
Ouch! You crazy?

10
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,928
Slow down, turn ahead!

11
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:21,755
Shut up! I drive this route every day!

12
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:39,533
Dull arrow.

13
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:44,063
Pointy arrow!

14
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:03,231
Strangers!

15
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:28,560
Abahachi's face shows
pain and grief.

16
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:32,600
Dark clouds gather over the land
where the Shoshone live.

17
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,640
Abahachi and his white brother
Ranger bid their "Hugh"

18
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:38,656
to Merry Mole, chief of the Shoshone.

19
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:40,726
Mighty.

20
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:42,196
What?

21
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:43,725
His name is Mighty Mole.

22
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:48,483
Abahachi brings the chief's dead son.
Abahachi is a murderer!

23
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:50,473
Just a sec, big misundertanding!

24
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:52,520
Yes, very big indeed!

25
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:54,364
Aweng konakate!

26
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:14,320
Hey, what's that on your arm?
Is that a dog?

27
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:17,832
What?

28
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:18,957
Ugh...

29
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:20,440
Well...

30
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,416
Where is my gold?

31
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:24,446
Just let him finish, asshole!

32
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:25,357
Hush, are you're crazy?

33
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:26,327
Should he let you finish or not?

34
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,567
Ok. The story was like this:
We had an appointment

35
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,487
Ok. The story was like this:
We had an appointment

36
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:36,287
with a realtor from Wyoming.
I had seen his ad in the paper,

37
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:39,607
and I quote:
"Quiet saloon in mint condition,

38
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:40,722
and I quote:
"Quiet saloon in mint condition,

39
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:45,716
no transfer fee, available immediately".
The new pub for my tribe!

40
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:50,716
His employees looked
respectable to us!

41
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:55,124
I didn't want to miss such a bargain
and borrowed your gold.

42
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:56,725
Indians!

43
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:59,247
Hiya!

44
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:25,204
Right on time, as the Shoshone always are,
your son Rabid Rabbit

45
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:29,559
brought the Shoshone credit.
Everybody liked each other.

46
00:06:29,882 --> 00:06:31,091
Whazup, wimp?

47
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:35,156
May I introduce:
Rabid rabbit, Santa Maria; Santa Maria,

48
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:39,200
Ranger, Ranger, Santa Maria, Rabit,
son of the chief of the Shoshone.

49
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:41,176
See, see, Shoshone!

50
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,206
The deal was closed!

51
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:46,444
I was the proudest Indian in the whole world!

52
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:50,808
Term: 15 years, interest rate 33%.

53
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:52,653
Yes, exactly!

54
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:54,199
What did he just say?

55
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,640
Not sure, he has a strong dialect.

56
00:06:56,987 --> 00:06:58,349
Abahachi?

57
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:01,279
Yes! Oh!

58
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:03,393
One bottle of firewater for free!

59
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:07,513
Congratulations to your new saloon.

60
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:09,639
This is on the house!

61
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:13,877
I baptize you to be called...
Uh...

62
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:16,725
Apache pub.
- Apache pub.

63
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,479
Well, I'd complain about that.

64
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:35,759
Feels comfortable in the hand!

65
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:43,313
Congrats! Great door!

66
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:45,439
You're never happy!
Always complaining!

67
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:53,599
BBQ nights, hanging out together,
indian classes in your own saloon!

68
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:56,719
I never mentioned classes!

69
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:02,919
End. Done!
Hand me the white flag!

70
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:06,960
How am I supposed to get
a white flag here?

71
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:11,205
Every indian always carries one,
just you don't!

72
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:15,718
Then it became quiet, too quiet.
The realtor from Wyoming

73
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:20,602
and his employees had left.
Just your son lay in the grass.

74
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:23,982
I was wondering how he could
sleep with all that noise.

75
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:24,836
They are gone!

76
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:26,956
I don't think he cares.

77
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:28,485
Why?

78
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:30,558
He is...

79
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:35,883
We paid last honors
to Rabid Rabbit.

80
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,639
Is there anything
you can actually pull off?

81
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:50,160
Truth is: the man who cheated my
tribe out of its new saloon

82
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:53,767
is also the murderer of your son.
And on top of that,

83
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,007
is also the murderer of your son.
And on top of that,

84
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:56,877
he also stole your gold!

85
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:58,847
What is the name of that man?

86
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:00,767
Santa Maria!

87
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:02,367
You stole the gold from the Shoshone!
You killed my son!

88
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,642
You stole the gold from the Shoshone!
You killed my son!

89
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:08,839
And now you bad mouth
the firends of my tribe!

90
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:10,993
How right you are, Mighty Mole!

91
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,040
Unbelievable!

92
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:15,033
These are the murderers
of your son!

93
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:17,080
No! Don't believe him!

94
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:19,217
Santa Maria speaks with
a twisted tongue!

95
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:21,407
When the sun has been
victorious over the moon

96
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,727
the Shoshone will send
Abahachi and his white brother

97
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:29,959
to the happy hunting grounds.
Mighty Mole has spoken!

98
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:32,016
Mighty mighty!

99
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:34,125
An Apache in a pickle.

100
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:38,160
Abahachi? Ranger?
Hombre? I'll clock off.

101
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:42,359
Do me a favor and keep an eye
on these two tonight.

102
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,592
We want to see them die tomorrow!

103
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:46,878
Allright, boss!

104
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,437
Err...

105
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:56,447
What is it?

106
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:00,237
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:00,337 --> 00:10:02,207
Why? Everything is just fine!

108
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:04,233
We both have our own poles.

109
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,359
And tomorrow we won't
be having any more trouble.

110
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,336
Don't be such a sourpuss.

111
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:10,066
I'm fed up to the back teeth!

112
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:12,353
Always the same crap
for the last 16 years!

113
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:14,400
Tied to some pole
every other day!

114
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,440
Keep it down, it's not their business!
What's wrong with you lately?

115
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:21,923
I am just not happy with the
overall situation!

116
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,875
Why not?

117
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:26,703
What do we do all day long?

118
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:30,840
Sneaking up with no purpose,
reading tracks for hours,

119
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:33,233
and riding side by side
with no point.

120
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,880
You call that riding?

121
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,873
What's wrong with my way of riding?

122
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:38,920
It's not riding,
it's animal cruelty!

123
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:40,413
Bite me!

124
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:41,959
How?!

125
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:56,318
Sht.

126
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,758
Sst!

127
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:03,598
Abahachi!

128
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:24,602
Quiet outside!
Or I'll call the cops!

129
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:29,322
I got a bunch of appointments
and you idiots won't let me sleep!

130
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:30,942
Turn the lighd off!

131
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:35,592
You spell light with a "T"!

132
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:59,767
Did you hear that? A man got
a rock in his private parts.

133
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:03,083
A new family jewel.
Look, the guard's asleep.

134
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,035
What did you say?

135
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:06,803
The guard's asleep.

136
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:08,993
No, about the jewel.

137
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:11,040
Just a bad pun.

138
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:15,763
That's no pun, that's the solution!
I got one! I had totally forgotten about it.

139
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:18,231
My jewel! A really big treasure!

140
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:20,756
Now you come up with a treasure!

141
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,952
That doesn't help us anymore.

142
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:25,198
It does. We can use it to pay
our debt with the Shoshone.

143
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:29,240
We're still charged with murder.

144
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:33,280
We need to prove that Santa Maria is the
real murderer of Rabid Rabbit.

145
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:39,118
Right. Also, on top of that
I only have a part of the treasure map.

146
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:43,240
Well, sometimes I think you do
this on purpose!

147
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:48,283
When I was a little indian,
my grandpa Gray Star

148
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:53,276
took me hunting. He always stressed
how important it is to divide up the loot.

149
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:57,161
I divided everything!
18 by 9! 13 by 7! 16 by 5! 17 by 8!

150
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:03,041
Grandpa sometimes called me the
Smallest Common Divisor.

151
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:06,716
Many summers passed.
On his deathbed

152
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:08,816
he gave me a treasure map.

153
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,965
And you divided it.

154
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,811
Yes, by four!

155
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:14,716
Who has the other three parts?

156
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,881
I don't know, I was drunk.
Well, that is...

157
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:23,159
I do remember one.
Well, thanks heavens...

158
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:28,760
Hey, who was that?
Who cares, let's go!

159
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:43,007
Well done, Hombre!
I am almost proud of you!

160
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:46,847
Follow them without attracting attention.
I'll stay here with Jim and John.

161
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:50,287
Chief Molehill must
not get suspicious.

162
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:52,084
We'll meet tomorrow in camp.

163
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:53,681
Ok, boss.

164
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,473
Hombre?

165
00:13:56,873 --> 00:13:58,519
We're a top team!

166
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:30,397
By god, that's terrible!

167
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:34,759
That doesn't look good, boss!

168
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:38,599
What a cowardish assassination!

169
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:47,240
Now they will also have to
answer for Hillarious Hare.

170
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,432
This means war!

171
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:51,678
Ooops, we have to leave! Jim, John!

172
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,925
Let's bow out on a high note!
Take care!

173
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:57,698
Unbury the hatchet!

174
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:01,818
We don't have one.

175
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,898
We don't?

176
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:06,848
We had one from the dollar store.

177
00:15:07,414 --> 00:15:08,898
But it broke.

178
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:12,948
Well, what could we unbury?

179
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:14,798
We have a folding chair.

180
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,196
Unbury the folding chair!

181
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:23,073
What?

182
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:24,619
I smell something.

183
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,859
It wasn't me!

184
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,895
Look! The Shoshone are signalling!

185
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:36,124
And? What do they write?

186
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:41,366
They are after us.
And they unburied the folding chair!

187
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:44,719
Now they've totally gone bonkers, right?

188
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:52,398
The chief of the Apache
must die!

189
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:53,954
To the horses!

190
00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:58,898
We don't have horses.

191
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:00,606
Didn't I have one?

192
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:03,898
Well, yes, you did...

193
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:06,741
...but it shrunk in the laundry.

194
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:17,079
What area is this?

195
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:21,040
Down there we'll find the
second part of the map!

196
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:24,159
And? What are we waiting for?

197
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:28,166
There is something
you should know.

198
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:32,200
My white brother needs to be very strong now!

199
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,125
Abahachi! My brother!

200
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:42,407
Quick, hugs! My, what a surprise!

201
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:45,407
I didn't expect you!
I totally didn't pick up.

202
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:49,627
And who is that handsome
young man you brought?

203
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:54,283
Want to introduce us?
Welcome to Powder Rosa Ranch!

204
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:58,366
Twin brother Winnetouch, blood bruder
Ranger, blood brother, twin brother!

205
00:16:58,407 --> 00:17:01,399
Antother brother!

206
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:21,566
Dangit!

207
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:27,324
I am out of splenda. Anyway.
One "Peach Fizz", no firewater...

208
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:32,725
For our patient a "pina colada".
Or would you rather like Prosecco?

209
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:38,557
To us! We won't meet again
that young! Cheers!

210
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:03,840
I am sooo curious.
Do tell me,

211
00:18:03,887 --> 00:18:07,163
how did the two of you meet?

212
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,313
Well, Ranger was a greenhorn.

213
00:18:09,413 --> 00:18:11,360
Wow! A greenhorn?

214
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:15,400
Then he saved my life.
And we said,

215
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:16,370
let's do blood brothers.

216
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,793
Really, with scoring?

217
00:18:18,393 --> 00:18:19,440
Yes.

218
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:24,117
You guys are fierce! But you've
always been a crazy chick!

219
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:28,160
That's why Abahachi became chief,
eben though I had the privilege,

220
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:32,723
cause I was born 2 minutes earlier.
But all that silly shouting and bang-bang

221
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:36,760
and arrows and shooting and the noise...
I wanted to be pearl diver,

222
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:41,244
but I cannot hold my breath long enough.
Now I am the owner of this beauty ranch,

223
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,233
the "Powder Rosa Ranch". Do you like it?

224
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,280
What? Yes! Very lovely!

225
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:48,444
Winnetouch! We need your help!

226
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:23,725
Guys, we'll ride on. Get on!

227
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:41,122
We don't want to ride on!
We are tired!

228
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:45,720
Who said that?

229
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:50,079
John did! John did!
Yes! We saw him!

230
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:02,879
So, you're tired, John.

231
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,415
Ok, go to bed. Everybody else: get on!

232
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:09,644
Oh dang! Assshole! Stupid pig!

233
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:11,633
What do you say?

234
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,680
Good night, John!

235
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:18,958
Mesdames et Messieurs.
My part of the map.

236
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:22,676
I knew I could rely on you!

237
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:24,646
Yeah, I am a pack rat.

238
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:28,126
I even keep your old toys.
Your Apache puppet tent.

239
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,113
You played with puppets as a kid?

240
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:32,160
What? No puppets!

241
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:34,074
And? Can you already see something?

242
00:20:34,174 --> 00:20:36,041
Yes, but not enough.

243
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:40,200
Too bad! Now what do we do?
Let's have a drink after that shock.

244
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:42,193
Another lychee limes?

245
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:44,240
Hm? No, thanks, Willi... Winnetouch!

246
00:20:44,287 --> 00:20:48,280
Do you recall by chance to whom
I gave the other two pieces?

247
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:49,972
Well, to the Greek and to Ushi!

248
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:51,717
Ah! Yes...

249
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,159
Of course! The Greek! Uschi!

250
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:04,478
We'll have to find them, with the
Shoshones breathing down our necks.

251
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:45,200
We're interested in your rad horse!

252
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:51,317
We shouldn't have traded
the pony and the folding chair.

253
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,332
Stop whining.

254
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:57,182
That squeaking is annoying.

255
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:02,003
Let the men sing a song.

256
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:13,077
No! I am not wearing that!
It's itching!

257
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:17,600
With that I'll look like a maggot!

258
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:20,719
Ok, I'll explain it again.

259
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:25,880
Ranger will ride to Uschi
in Rosewell City.

260
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,999
I'll try to find the Greek.
You'll pretend you're me

261
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,494
to throw the Shoshones off our trail.

262
00:22:31,594 --> 00:22:34,041
Well, I smell totally different than you!

263
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:35,055
Right!

264
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:36,123
If everything works out,

265
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:40,160
we'll meet in the Thunder valley
at the dandelion at the old basswood,

266
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:41,360
where the sun kisses the squirrel.

267
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,614
I'll never find that.

268
00:22:42,714 --> 00:22:45,122
Just a sec!

269
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:49,160
What if one of us suddenly gets sick?

270
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:55,426
Ok. If anything goes wrong
we'll meet back here

271
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:56,836
at Powder Rosa Ranch.

272
00:22:57,036 --> 00:22:59,806
Go there, come back, kiss basswood,
ride back and forth...

273
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,880
Why not just stay here
and I cook a nice dinner?

274
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,466
I can't shoot and fight anyway!

275
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:07,386
I'm afraid your, err our brother
needs a crash course.

276
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:13,478
Lesson 1: Stalking.
Suitable branches are very important.

277
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:18,521
Tree, bush, or twig.
Stalking is most fun on even ground.

278
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:22,560
Smooth, rhythmical movements make
for quick and unnoticed progress.

279
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:26,600
Indians have stalking in their genes,

280
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:30,959
however, everybody develops
their own style eventually.

281
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:34,761
Lesson 2: Close combat.
Rule of thumb:

282
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:39,437
Lefties use their left fist,
righties use the other one.

283
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:43,400
Precise targeting increases
the chances for a hit.

284
00:23:44,327 --> 00:23:49,321
Lesson 3: War paint.
War paint has a long tradition

285
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:53,326
and is used to scare the enemy.

286
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:59,363
Abstract war paint is frequently met
with lack of understanding and intoleration.

287
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,081
Lesson 4: Riding.

288
00:24:02,127 --> 00:24:06,120
Anticipatory riding is mandatory
for the athletic rider!

289
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:11,161
The horse is both a status symbol
and provides mobility in the Wild West.

290
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:15,280
Opinions diverge regarding women at the wheel.

291
00:24:15,327 --> 00:24:20,162
Lesson 5: Pipe of peace.
This symbolic act of reconcilation

292
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:25,201
is also called "chill out after battle".
Precise measurements are crucial.

293
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:30,446
Too much or the wrong stuff can
have undesired side effects.

294
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:33,479
Last but not least: Shooting.

295
00:24:33,527 --> 00:24:37,520
The showcase of all skill!
High tech! Man and machine

296
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:39,167
must form one entity.
Choice of weapon and caliber

297
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:41,967
must form one entity.
Choice of weapon and caliber

298
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:45,807
is crucial for the shooter.

299
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:54,999
We'll leave at sunrise!

300
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:01,593
They are down there, boss!

301
00:25:01,693 --> 00:25:03,640
Good. Don't lose sight of them.

302
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:05,235
Post guards.

303
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:06,884
Yes, post guards.

304
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:09,158
Post guards!

305
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:12,320
Post guards!

306
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:13,312
Hombre.

307
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:14,358
Yes?

308
00:25:14,407 --> 00:25:15,853
Go ahead and brew coffee.

309
00:25:15,953 --> 00:25:17,399
What is that?

310
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:20,007
A hot, caffeinated beverage.

311
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:34,287
My father!

312
00:25:34,287 --> 00:25:35,567
He was still young back than.
Always in a good mood. A crazy dog.

313
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,764
He was still young back than.
Always in a good mood. A crazy dog.

314
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:40,412
He was fluent in French.

315
00:25:40,512 --> 00:25:42,117
How come?

316
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:46,877
We don't know. I also got
the long hair from him.

317
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:49,522
Who is that?

318
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:53,560
That's Winnetouch.
With Leatherstocking.

319
00:25:56,767 --> 00:26:00,203
And this is Uschi.
What a woman!

320
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:07,802
Back in the day she left the tribe
to become a singer in Rosewell City.

321
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,038
What is that?

322
00:26:24,807 --> 00:26:26,753
Someone is brewing coffee.

323
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:28,800
The shoshone make coffee?

324
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:33,557
Winnetouch go hide!
They must not see us together!

325
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:48,119
We are trapped!

326
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:53,719
Surprise!

327
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,073
What is that?

328
00:26:58,573 --> 00:27:00,520
My little secret tunnel!

329
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:03,559
Takes you straight to a bush.

330
00:27:43,927 --> 00:27:46,885
Are you guys Shoshones?

331
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:48,758
Indians!

332
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:50,592
Indians!

333
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:51,638
Quick, follow him!

334
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:55,136
We'll get him!

335
00:27:55,236 --> 00:27:57,206
Yes, I'll cut him off!

336
00:27:57,247 --> 00:28:01,604
Don't let the redskin get away.
Don't shoot, we need him alive!

337
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:07,163
My brother.
My brother.

338
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,736
What do you think why I pulled you over?

339
00:28:50,036 --> 00:28:51,806
Are you a photographer?

340
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:55,726
Careful, young man!
I don't have to do this friendly!

341
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,536
Did you soup up that horse?

342
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,806
It's my brother in law's horse.

343
00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:01,793
And what's the reason for the hurry?

344
00:29:01,993 --> 00:29:03,840
The Shoshones, you know...

345
00:29:03,887 --> 00:29:05,856
They unburied the folding chair.

346
00:29:06,056 --> 00:29:07,926
The folding chair.

347
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:10,720
Well, Mr... Ranger.

348
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:14,726
Please blow here.

349
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:19,879
0,0 blood alcohol! Golly!

350
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:24,045
Nobody managed to pull that off yet!
Have a good ride!

351
00:30:00,687 --> 00:30:02,127
Hiya!

352
00:30:08,687 --> 00:30:11,724
I think I see a mirage!

353
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:13,733
Dimitri!

354
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,279
Abahachi!

355
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:17,213
Bless you!

356
00:30:17,313 --> 00:30:18,759
It really is you!

357
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:22,800
Look, friends, this is Abahachi,
the famous chief Apache,

358
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:25,294
warrior and brother of Ranger.

359
00:30:25,394 --> 00:30:27,841
You'll be the hero in my new book.

360
00:30:27,887 --> 00:30:29,816
Who's he?

361
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,846
Karl May. Only silly things in his head.

362
00:30:31,887 --> 00:30:33,333
Say, how did you find me?

363
00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:35,080
You're mentioned in the travel guide.

364
00:30:35,128 --> 00:30:36,856
Let's have a drink to that!

365
00:30:36,956 --> 00:30:39,886
No. I need to talk to you!

366
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:41,595
It's about our little secret.

367
00:30:41,695 --> 00:30:43,363
Hellas!

368
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:47,164
Are you talking about
our map treasure?

369
00:30:51,927 --> 00:30:55,158
A book about an Indian treasure!

370
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:58,035
Good one!

371
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:02,717
Where is the treasure map?

372
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:04,965
The map?
Ranger has it.

373
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:06,233
Oh god. I am tattling too much.

374
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,359
And where is that Ranger?

375
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:10,398
Shopping!

376
00:31:12,647 --> 00:31:15,174
Listen up, Abahachi, chief of the...

377
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:16,401
Apache!

378
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:17,893
Thanks, Hombre.

379
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:19,439
No problem, boss.

380
00:31:19,487 --> 00:31:23,780
Even my patience has its limits.
My men are mean, brutal, and very lonely.

381
00:31:23,827 --> 00:31:25,773
They could hurt you really bad.

382
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:27,520
An indian doesn't know pain.

383
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:30,206
We lack those enzymes!

384
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:33,045
Ow, ow, ow!

385
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:35,283
Ow! Ow!

386
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:38,319
Ok, that's enough!

387
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:45,085
Well, Abahachi? Will you now tell
where Ranger went?

388
00:31:45,127 --> 00:31:49,120
Yeah, great, now you got me.
He went to meet Uschi!

389
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:50,213
That Uschi?

390
00:31:50,513 --> 00:31:53,859
Yes. Now untie me.
I am not playing anymore.

391
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:56,200
No can do, Abahachi.

392
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,193
We need you as a hostage!

393
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,240
You're soo mean!

394
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:04,280
Hombre, you stay here
and guard our chief.

395
00:32:04,327 --> 00:32:08,400
If we don't return within 2 days,
finish him off.

396
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:14,639
Allright, boss!

397
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:20,201
I'm warning you! When you go to the
restroom, you'll better sit down!

398
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:29,007
One Four Harlots!

399
00:32:41,247 --> 00:32:44,762
How do the eyes get in the cheese?

400
00:32:46,647 --> 00:32:48,239
Hiya.

401
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:52,280
You must be Ranger!
The man with the southern dialect.

402
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:56,764
Friend of the Indians. Founder of
"mothers against fire arrows".

403
00:32:56,807 --> 00:33:00,800
What brings you to this godforsaken lands?

404
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:05,964
Does someone named Uschi work here?

405
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:07,998
Oh yeah!

406
00:33:19,407 --> 00:33:21,716
Hi!

407
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:24,721
Hello, you!

408
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:29,724
I ask you
and all the the other men, too.

409
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:33,722
Is it true that I'm driving you crazy?

410
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:36,756
Come on, tell me, sugar boys.

411
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:41,159
And what you get is what you see,

412
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:44,925
you can't help, you must fall for me.

413
00:33:45,447 --> 00:33:48,723
What's in your hardest dreams,
I go for...

414
00:33:59,887 --> 00:34:03,675
It's the clue that me
as a good girl

415
00:34:04,207 --> 00:34:07,438
wanna whip my hip like that.

416
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:33,076
You got... beautiful bells.

417
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:34,874
These are my grandma's bells.

418
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:36,722
Great!

419
00:34:38,847 --> 00:34:41,072
Do you have a needle and
some thread by chance?

420
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:43,398
Oh! Yes. Of course.

421
00:34:50,127 --> 00:34:52,118
Here you go!

422
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:06,692
Well, now you're here.

423
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:08,318
Yes!

424
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:12,021
Yes! Well, then I can leave again.

425
00:35:12,352 --> 00:35:13,738
No, don't go.

426
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:17,442
I am... actually here
for the treasure map.

427
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:19,634
Oh god!

428
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:21,522
You do have a part
of the map, right?

429
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:23,514
Could you undo my choker?

430
00:35:23,614 --> 00:35:25,402
Yes, sure!

431
00:35:25,727 --> 00:35:27,412
Don't talk about the map!

432
00:35:27,512 --> 00:35:29,197
Come again?

433
00:35:29,247 --> 00:35:31,836
Do not talk about the map here!

434
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:34,526
Ok, I'll stand over there.

435
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:40,120
Abahachi already got two pieces
of the treasure map.

436
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:43,118
Dimitri, that Greek guy, has another part.

437
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,095
Hush!

438
00:35:44,395 --> 00:35:46,524
And you have the last part.

439
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:49,459
The map is complete
and everybody will be happy.

440
00:35:52,207 --> 00:35:55,244
Yes. Now I am happy, too.

441
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:58,882
Hey, you guys didn't
eavesdrop on us, did you?

442
00:35:59,247 --> 00:36:03,240
Ranger, I have to make a confession.
We hold Abahachi hostage.

443
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:05,233
Wonderful, it had to come like that!

444
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:09,130
And you, my little gold fish,
will tell me your sweet secret, quick!

445
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:11,646
Where is your part of the map?

446
00:36:11,727 --> 00:36:15,223
Or do you want me to
let my men loose?

447
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:19,814
Eeek!

448
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:21,161
Hands off!

449
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:25,480
She has nothing to do with all this!
Take me instead!

450
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:31,525
Ugh, ok, take her instead!

451
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:04,638
A beautiful rear can also endear.
Especially when it's about gold.

452
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:05,894
Oh, well.

453
00:37:05,994 --> 00:37:07,201
So!

454
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:11,763
If you want, go get an ice cream,
and then let's get back to camp!

455
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:31,516
Then we moved cause they chased us
away from our territories.

456
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:35,560
We became backpack indians.
Originally I wanted to

457
00:37:35,607 --> 00:37:39,600
go to San Francisco and be a pearl diver.
But that's teeming with earthquakes.

458
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:43,640
Do you even know what an earthquake is?
No worries, you didn't miss out.

459
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:46,679
Done, ready for the spa!

460
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:12,533
Uh-oh.

461
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:14,079
What's it?

462
00:38:14,207 --> 00:38:15,914
Apollo 13 is afraid of the
road rail crossing.

463
00:38:16,514 --> 00:38:17,722
How come?

464
00:38:18,247 --> 00:38:23,605
His 12 brothers were all hit
by a big locomotive steam!

465
00:38:23,647 --> 00:38:26,639
Only one thing can help: Ouzo!

466
00:38:26,727 --> 00:38:31,676
My, Dimitri! We have to keep moving!
There is no train to be seen!

467
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:39,120
See, Apollo 13 is an intelligent mule!

468
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:47,806
Apollo 13. Have you bonkers gone?

469
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:49,644
Oh!

470
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:53,965
Come, I beg you!
Apollo 13, don't make us unhappy!

471
00:38:55,487 --> 00:38:58,007
This is a really fast train.

472
00:39:00,287 --> 00:39:05,122
Apollo 13! Don't always be
such a head bull! Hellas!

473
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:08,639
That might get a bit close.

474
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:51,004
Great, now we can move on!

475
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:08,400
Dismount! We'll stay here for the night.

476
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,439
At sunrise we move on to
Powder Rosa Ranch.

477
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:25,001
Why the heck is the light on in my hut?

478
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:29,883
But boss, that's John.
Remember, you sent him to bed.

479
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,918
Ah, right!

480
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:36,920
Isn't it great to come home and know:

481
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:41,961
There is someone waiting for you.
Smell of fresh coffee in the air,

482
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:47,127
crispy fried bacon, and in the distance
a wolf songs a lonely song.

483
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:49,806
Strangers in the night...

484
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:55,160
What an asshole!
John drank from my cup!

485
00:40:55,207 --> 00:40:57,153
John slept in my bed!

486
00:40:57,253 --> 00:40:59,200
John put my pen in his ass!

487
00:40:59,247 --> 00:41:03,240
Yes, that's John.

488
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:18,216
Did you know the Shoshones
had a folding chair?

489
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:19,365
No.

490
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:21,398
Yes!

491
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:29,562
Oh, look, the full moon!

492
00:41:31,647 --> 00:41:32,557
Yes.

493
00:41:35,647 --> 00:41:40,562
Back in the day at a full moon,
Abahachi and me often went for a swim.

494
00:41:40,607 --> 00:41:45,044
We hid each others clothes
and laid little tracks.

495
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:49,080
He was always so emphatic.
He consoled me

496
00:41:49,127 --> 00:41:52,563
when the Little Beaver was hurting me.

497
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:57,555
And what happend to your Little Beaver?

498
00:41:57,727 --> 00:42:01,083
Well, Big Beaver.
Chief of the Kiowa.

499
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:03,758
Ah, I see.

500
00:42:04,727 --> 00:42:05,796
Uschi?

501
00:42:05,896 --> 00:42:06,866
Yes?

502
00:42:07,407 --> 00:42:10,922
Can you reach my left back pocket?

503
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:12,893
Do you have a...

504
00:42:12,993 --> 00:42:13,739
Yes!

505
00:42:34,047 --> 00:42:36,720
Do you hear that?

506
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:38,758
Yes.

507
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:40,852
They play our song.

508
00:42:40,952 --> 00:42:42,478
Yes.

509
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:10,124
Where the heck is that Ranger!
He's usually on time!

510
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:12,313
Hope he didn't get sick.

511
00:43:12,513 --> 00:43:14,160
Look. There!

512
00:43:14,207 --> 00:43:16,876
Yet another star shooting.

513
00:43:16,976 --> 00:43:19,645
Ah, now you can make a wish.

514
00:43:19,687 --> 00:43:23,680
I'd like to be an Indian.
A real skin red.

515
00:43:24,087 --> 00:43:25,725
Hm.

516
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:29,965
Why? I mean, being Greek isn't bad either!

517
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:34,000
Not bad, but do you remember,
even when I was Dimitri little,

518
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:38,040
that was my big dream.
Ever since your grandpa Gray Star

519
00:43:38,087 --> 00:43:42,080
picked me out of the Mississippi.
I was in that little basket.

520
00:43:42,127 --> 00:43:46,120
just about to go over that big fall water!
It was close!

521
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:48,113
I was a very happy child foster.

522
00:43:48,213 --> 00:43:50,160
You were not a foster child,

523
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:53,722
you were age 16 and
in the middle of puberty!

524
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:58,204
I strongly believe in it.
One day I'll be an indian.

525
00:43:58,247 --> 00:44:02,763
Not riding a mule anymore
but a real horse.

526
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:10,517
Do you need a nutcracker? No?

527
00:44:11,887 --> 00:44:15,596
Get up, guys! Get up!
Up, up, up!

528
00:44:15,647 --> 00:44:17,638
Get up!

529
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:25,001
Jeffrey farted!
Really!

530
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:30,522
Jeffrey farted again!

531
00:44:31,047 --> 00:44:35,962
Morning, guys! Everybody go pee,
and then we ride on!

532
00:44:55,287 --> 00:44:58,279
Ho! Ho! Ho!

533
00:45:11,887 --> 00:45:13,878
Hey!

534
00:45:18,127 --> 00:45:20,561
And on we go!

535
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:33,643
Jim, John! Come with me!

536
00:45:38,327 --> 00:45:39,955
Damnit! Abahachi escaped!

537
00:45:40,055 --> 00:45:41,683
Respect!

538
00:45:50,127 --> 00:45:51,971
No outside shoes in here!

539
00:45:52,071 --> 00:45:53,915
Yes! Got another one!

540
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:56,476
Hombre is really great at diving for pearls!

541
00:45:56,576 --> 00:45:58,085
Get out!

542
00:45:58,127 --> 00:46:00,561
Turn around!

543
00:46:11,527 --> 00:46:12,846
Oops!

544
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:18,316
Jeffrey farted!

545
00:46:18,447 --> 00:46:21,325
The damn lock is jammed.

546
00:46:24,087 --> 00:46:25,533
Hands up!

547
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:27,079
Yes! Drop your weapon!

548
00:46:37,207 --> 00:46:39,198
Feather!

549
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:44,998
This... is... the... shoe...

550
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:48,278
of... Ma-ni-tou.

551
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:50,812
The shoe of Manitou?

552
00:46:50,912 --> 00:46:52,597
Oh, no.

553
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:57,398
That was easy. Hombre, you coming?
We need to get going!

554
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,323
Ranger!

555
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:09,724
If you think it's over,
there's a light in the darkness.

556
00:47:10,207 --> 00:47:13,643
i before e except after c!

557
00:47:14,247 --> 00:47:16,238
Hombre!

558
00:47:18,447 --> 00:47:21,252
Do you have a last wish?

559
00:47:21,352 --> 00:47:24,158
Yes, the song from the
super-perforator ad!

560
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:20,046
Yeehaw!

561
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:23,877
Come on, guys! Let's move!

562
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,856
There is your light!

563
00:48:34,956 --> 00:48:37,045
They torch my house without asking first!

564
00:48:37,087 --> 00:48:40,204
Abahachi, please pass me the knife.

565
00:48:40,247 --> 00:48:44,206
Shoot. I must have forgotten it
after whittling in the Thunder valley.

566
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:46,353
Why do indians always have to whittle!

567
00:48:46,453 --> 00:48:48,559
Got a problem with my hobby?

568
00:48:48,607 --> 00:48:52,885
Nothing against your hobby, it's just about
the knife! These do cost money, you know!

569
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:56,920
Learn to watch for your stuff!
Your sloppiness is driving me nuts!

570
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,873
You are driving me nuts, too!

571
00:48:58,973 --> 00:49:00,880
Come on, spit it out!

572
00:49:01,007 --> 00:49:05,159
Always affairs: "Would you like
to see my bear killer, mylady?"

573
00:49:05,207 --> 00:49:09,200
Says the guy who used to play with
puppets and can't even grow a beard!

574
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:11,694
Forget the beard! You need character!

575
00:49:11,794 --> 00:49:14,241
Great character, hiding women's
clothes at night!

576
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:18,724
So? I'll even admit it! At least
women do go for a swim with me!

577
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:21,196
Uschi would go for a swim
with me any time!

578
00:49:21,296 --> 00:49:22,726
Ridiculous!

579
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:25,147
Would you stop it?
Till someone's crying!

580
00:49:25,147 --> 00:49:25,716
Oh, you shut up!

581
00:49:26,507 --> 00:49:27,897
Hellas!

582
00:49:28,397 --> 00:49:29,887
Dimitri! There you are!

583
00:49:34,767 --> 00:49:38,760
Hey! Wanna ride with me?
I got plenty of room!

584
00:49:38,847 --> 00:49:41,805
No! I cannot ride in that!

585
00:49:41,847 --> 00:49:44,725
Walk, Jacqueline.

586
00:49:44,967 --> 00:49:49,643
Slow, slow! Careful!
Don't go so fast or you'll throw up again.

587
00:49:52,927 --> 00:49:55,725
The shoe of Manitou!

588
00:50:16,367 --> 00:50:20,360
Shortly I'll be the richest man in the West.

589
00:50:20,407 --> 00:50:22,854
I could make you my woman!

590
00:50:22,954 --> 00:50:25,401
But I am already a woman...?

591
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:31,594
Nice and slow, Jacqueline,
or you'll throw up again!

592
00:50:31,894 --> 00:50:36,602
At this speed snail
we'll never get there!

593
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:45,964
Walk! Walk, Jacqueline!

594
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:52,080
Yes, yes, good, Jacqueline.

595
00:50:52,127 --> 00:50:56,723
I've told them a thousand times
you have a sensitive stomach.

596
00:50:56,767 --> 00:51:00,726
Let it all out, Jaqueline!
Not through the nose.

597
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:05,366
Honey, I'll be back in a sec.

598
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:09,759
That's what you get for
your reckless speeding!

599
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:12,838
Hombre!

600
00:51:15,087 --> 00:51:19,319
Oh, you should have emptied
the ashtray in time!

601
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:24,365
Well, you'll stay here and think
about what you've done.

602
00:51:24,407 --> 00:51:28,480
Jim, John! You guys come with me.
Everybody else stays here.

603
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:35,201
And pay good attention
to my future bride!

604
00:51:40,887 --> 00:51:43,845
And don't give her
more cherries!

605
00:51:45,487 --> 00:51:47,717
Hey, Santa!

606
00:51:52,767 --> 00:51:54,372
Will you bring us a gift?

607
00:51:54,472 --> 00:51:56,077
Something exciting!

608
00:51:56,127 --> 00:51:57,874
Something to play with! Yes!

609
00:51:57,974 --> 00:51:59,722
And chocolate! Yes!

610
00:52:01,607 --> 00:52:04,599
Better have an apple instead.

611
00:52:11,767 --> 00:52:15,203
No old indian
guarding the treasure?

612
00:52:15,807 --> 00:52:18,799
That's unusual.

613
00:52:21,447 --> 00:52:22,933
Hello?

614
00:52:23,033 --> 00:52:24,519
Hello? Hello?

615
00:52:36,007 --> 00:52:37,998
Cuckoo.

616
00:52:38,047 --> 00:52:39,453
Cuckoo.

617
00:52:39,553 --> 00:52:40,959
Cuckoo.

618
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:42,953
Ok, now get out.

619
00:52:43,053 --> 00:52:45,000
Ok, now get out.

620
00:52:49,047 --> 00:52:53,359
Can I have a bite from yours?
Mine is mealy.

621
00:52:55,807 --> 00:52:57,992
Hellas, they are down there!

622
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,278
Do you guys see Uschi?

623
00:53:00,487 --> 00:53:02,695
No. I think we'll need a plan.

624
00:53:02,795 --> 00:53:05,003
Want me to distract them again?

625
00:53:05,047 --> 00:53:08,039
Uh... pff... mh-mh!

626
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:11,757
Ok, I'll change clothes again!

627
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:14,166
Alarm!

628
00:53:14,207 --> 00:53:16,721
Hellas y'all!

629
00:53:17,247 --> 00:53:18,733
Who the heck is he?

630
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,319
No idea.

631
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,313
What's your business here?

632
00:53:22,413 --> 00:53:24,360
I am Dimitri Stoubakis.

633
00:53:24,407 --> 00:53:29,401
Bandit exchange from Greece;
supposed to check in with Maria Santa?

634
00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:35,845
This is a dead end, boss!

635
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:39,004
They tricked us.

636
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:42,881
John? When do we
usually do lunch?

637
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:45,123
Around 12.

638
00:53:54,447 --> 00:53:57,962
Jeffrey farted again!

639
00:54:22,127 --> 00:54:24,083
Hush!

640
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:26,118
Ranger!

641
00:54:26,207 --> 00:54:28,198
Uschi!

642
00:54:36,247 --> 00:54:39,239
How did you find me?

643
00:54:39,287 --> 00:54:42,279
For first time...
awesome!

644
00:54:46,407 --> 00:54:48,353
Now would you stop it!

645
00:54:48,453 --> 00:54:50,400
Winnetouch! I thought you were...

646
00:54:50,447 --> 00:54:54,440
Hombre! Bad weeds grow tall!
Are you on our side now?

647
00:55:30,407 --> 00:55:33,399
Ok, kids. You take a lunch break.

648
00:55:34,847 --> 00:55:36,838
Clear!

649
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:39,720
So clear!

650
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:44,160
The coast is so clear! Yes, yes.

651
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:48,200
I'd suggest we introduce ourselves.
Dimitri Stoubakis. 30 years old.

652
00:55:48,247 --> 00:55:52,240
My zodiac is virgo and
in my time free I tinker

653
00:55:52,287 --> 00:55:56,280
house birds with my saw hand.
What are your hobbies?

654
00:55:57,847 --> 00:55:59,793
And why can't we come?

655
00:55:59,893 --> 00:56:01,840
Exactly! Who says...

656
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:05,880
you're not gonna take off
with the treasure?

657
00:56:09,887 --> 00:56:12,055
What was that?

658
00:56:12,155 --> 00:56:14,324
That was the sound
of Santa Maria's colt.

659
00:56:19,207 --> 00:56:23,644
That's it. Cover me.
I'm going in.

660
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:25,133
My brother!

661
00:56:25,233 --> 00:56:26,600
Yes?

662
00:56:26,647 --> 00:56:27,632
Take care!

663
00:56:27,732 --> 00:56:28,717
Ok.

664
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:31,725
Take cover.

665
00:56:34,407 --> 00:56:35,756
Winnetouch!

666
00:56:35,856 --> 00:56:37,205
What's it?

667
00:56:37,247 --> 00:56:38,431
Cover!

668
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:39,715
Come again?

669
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:41,713
Go hide!

670
00:56:41,813 --> 00:56:43,760
Ok, I'll try.

671
00:56:45,087 --> 00:56:47,078
Ah!

672
00:56:47,887 --> 00:56:52,165
Hello? Dang it,
is this a darkroom?

673
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:00,839
Get lost, stupid bat!

674
00:57:01,967 --> 00:57:04,056
My, what it looks like here!

675
00:57:04,156 --> 00:57:06,245
Like the place has
been hit by a bomb.

676
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:12,716
Thanks god the light
is off again!

677
00:57:45,407 --> 00:57:47,523
Stop that!

678
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:39,200
Are you crazy?
Don't scare me like that!

679
00:58:39,247 --> 00:58:41,193
Say, what do you have there?

680
00:58:41,293 --> 00:58:43,240
Nothing! What are you guys doing here?

681
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:45,296
I told you to keep cover!

682
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,405
If it always takes you so long...

683
00:58:47,447 --> 00:58:48,893
What?

684
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:50,439
Yes! Everything takes you ages!

685
00:58:50,487 --> 00:58:51,410
You dwaddle! You're a slowpoke!

686
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:52,433
I am a slowpoke!

687
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:53,680
Ranger!

688
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:56,473
He has a point, others say that, too.

689
00:58:56,573 --> 00:58:58,520
Hear that? He's provoking me!

690
00:58:58,567 --> 00:59:02,560
For years now! I don't have to listen
to this any longer from a...

691
00:59:02,607 --> 00:59:04,553
second class mouth organ player!

692
00:59:04,653 --> 00:59:06,600
Why don't you just get
a hair cut before we talk?

693
00:59:06,647 --> 00:59:08,093
Unbound cheek!

694
00:59:08,393 --> 00:59:10,640
Why don't y'all write down what
you down like about the other?

695
00:59:10,687 --> 00:59:12,633
He can't even write!

696
00:59:12,733 --> 00:59:14,680
Nobody in our gang can!

697
00:59:14,727 --> 00:59:16,173
I don't need to write.
I can read tracks!

698
00:59:16,273 --> 00:59:17,719
Great! That's a start!

699
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:21,760
This is his only point!
"I can read tracks!"

700
00:59:21,807 --> 00:59:23,753
You are such a great tracker!

701
00:59:23,853 --> 00:59:25,800
I am not taking this any longer!

702
00:59:25,847 --> 00:59:27,793
And you call yourself blood brother!

703
00:59:27,893 --> 00:59:29,840
I've always said,
I need more time.

704
00:59:29,887 --> 00:59:33,880
He wanted to be blood brothers
after only two weeks!

705
00:59:33,927 --> 00:59:37,920
He probably felt like it back then.

706
00:59:37,967 --> 00:59:39,913
When you're a kid you do stupid things.

707
00:59:40,013 --> 00:59:41,960
Stupid things?

708
00:59:42,007 --> 00:59:43,993
Did I hear "stupid things", Uschi?

709
00:59:44,093 --> 00:59:46,080
I didn't pay attention...

710
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:48,255
Yes, I think he said "stupid things".

711
00:59:48,355 --> 00:59:50,484
Being blood brothers is stupid? Ok!

712
00:59:50,527 --> 00:59:52,473
Then we'll stop it. I quit!

713
00:59:52,573 --> 00:59:54,520
Me too, let's quit!

714
00:59:54,567 --> 00:59:56,513
See if I care! I don't need you!

715
00:59:56,613 --> 00:59:58,560
Ok, in that case,
I'd like my toothbrush back!

716
00:59:58,607 --> 01:00:02,600
Here you go! As far as I remember,
you still have my peace pipe!

717
01:00:02,647 --> 01:00:06,640
Take it!

718
01:00:08,807 --> 01:00:10,753
Come on, we don't need no Ranger!

719
01:00:10,853 --> 01:00:12,800
Abahachi, I...

720
01:00:12,847 --> 01:00:14,736
Yes, what is it?

721
01:00:14,836 --> 01:00:16,726
I cannot go with you.

722
01:00:17,767 --> 01:00:19,837
What, why?

723
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:22,720
Ranger and I, we...

724
01:00:25,447 --> 01:00:30,726
That's exactly why we never
allowed girls in our gang!

725
01:00:30,767 --> 01:00:33,725
I am so sorry!

726
01:00:34,407 --> 01:00:36,716
Yes, but...

727
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,722
Full moon...

728
01:00:40,287 --> 01:00:42,847
Swimming, hiding clothes...

729
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:49,087
And you always told me:
Abahachi, when we grow up...

730
01:00:49,087 --> 01:00:50,447
And you always told me:
Abahachi, when we grow up...

731
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:52,847
But 5 feet is not grown up!

732
01:00:56,087 --> 01:00:58,647
I see.

733
01:00:59,327 --> 01:01:02,558
So it's the two of you now.

734
01:01:06,447 --> 01:01:09,439
Well, then I don't want to...
Well...

735
01:01:11,327 --> 01:01:13,716
I wish you...

736
01:01:14,247 --> 01:01:19,116
I guess I'll go in alone.
I actually prefer it that way anyway.

737
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:24,036
So, where is the entrance?
Time to read some tracks!

738
01:01:24,367 --> 01:01:26,403
There we go!

739
01:01:58,007 --> 01:02:00,999
I got one left.

740
01:02:08,167 --> 01:02:10,476
Abahachi!

741
01:02:15,167 --> 01:02:18,159
It was self-defense!

742
01:02:28,127 --> 01:02:32,917
You little slicky sausage.
You thought you could get away

743
01:02:32,967 --> 01:02:35,033
with everything!

744
01:02:35,133 --> 01:02:37,199
Hombre! Not in that tone!

745
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:41,241
I've been watching this for long enough now.

746
01:02:41,527 --> 01:02:45,600
The wind has changed, buddy!

747
01:02:45,647 --> 01:02:48,639
Ok, I'll bring it back.

748
01:04:51,807 --> 01:04:54,719
My brother!

749
01:04:54,967 --> 01:04:57,117
My brother!

750
01:04:57,167 --> 01:04:59,158
You're alive?

751
01:05:04,887 --> 01:05:08,721
His candy heart saved his life!

752
01:05:08,927 --> 01:05:09,600
Yes, I'm alive!

753
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,373
He's alive?

754
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:11,919
Yes!

755
01:06:38,647 --> 01:06:42,117
Hombre! Don't make yourself unhappy!

756
01:06:42,167 --> 01:06:47,161
We're all a little stressed.
You've always been so good to me!

757
01:06:47,207 --> 01:06:52,201
You often saved my life,
helped me with my divorces!

758
01:06:52,247 --> 01:06:56,718
You allowed me to lead a comfortable
life free of worries.

759
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:58,736
Do you want to risk all that?

760
01:06:58,836 --> 01:07:00,806
Give me that necklace!

761
01:07:00,847 --> 01:07:05,841
Oh, that's what it's all about.
Why don't you say so. If that's all.

762
01:07:07,447 --> 01:07:10,439
Woah! Crazy, isn't it?

763
01:07:10,487 --> 01:07:12,433
There you are! My, I had an experience!

764
01:07:12,533 --> 01:07:14,480
Sshh!

765
01:07:14,527 --> 01:07:18,520
Look at that!
That's not how it's supposed to be!

766
01:07:22,727 --> 01:07:24,718
Sorry!

767
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:31,119
That doesn't look too bad!

768
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:34,477
That's the end to your evil deeds!

769
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,792
I will never get that out!

770
01:07:36,892 --> 01:07:39,157
Oh, what a dream!

771
01:07:39,727 --> 01:07:41,992
This is our treasure!

772
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:44,357
My, may I wear it?

773
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:48,607
Mesdames et Messieurs... voila!

774
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,407
Mesdames et Messieurs... voila!

775
01:07:56,927 --> 01:07:59,517
Hey, where are you going?

776
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,207
Faster! Faster! Come on!

777
01:08:04,607 --> 01:08:07,196
Have you used such a thing before?

778
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:09,886
Yes, but a different model!

779
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:17,081
Noo!

780
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:41,727
Heads down!

781
01:08:45,607 --> 01:08:50,317
How much more to go?
I can't hold it any longer! Wow!

782
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:59,246
Winnetouch!

783
01:09:04,847 --> 01:09:06,599
Faster!

784
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:14,727
What is that?

785
01:09:14,727 --> 01:09:19,047
I've never heard anything like that!

786
01:09:20,647 --> 01:09:22,399
So beautiful.

787
01:09:29,567 --> 01:09:33,480
Hellas! You came to
safe me, right?

788
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:42,805
Indians!

789
01:09:56,207 --> 01:10:00,200
A classic down show,
if I am not taken mis!

790
01:10:15,007 --> 01:10:17,965
Come on, let's scram!

791
01:10:24,727 --> 01:10:26,718
Abahachi!

792
01:10:34,487 --> 01:10:35,886
Hiya!

793
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:38,215
This time Abahachi won't escape!

794
01:10:38,315 --> 01:10:40,603
No need for that!

795
01:10:40,647 --> 01:10:43,445
Winnetouch, would you come please?

796
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:49,477
By Manitou! Two times Abahachi?

797
01:10:50,887 --> 01:10:52,355
Hello!

798
01:10:52,455 --> 01:10:53,924
Winnetouch? Give him the treasure!

799
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,414
My god!

800
01:10:55,514 --> 01:10:56,721
What?

801
01:10:57,247 --> 01:10:58,414
Gone!

802
01:10:58,514 --> 01:10:59,681
You don't say!

803
01:10:59,727 --> 01:11:01,173
That was so obvious!

804
01:11:01,273 --> 01:11:02,719
What do you mean, "gone"?

805
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:04,412
Gone!

806
01:11:04,512 --> 01:11:06,157
Abahachi lies! Kill him!

807
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:08,793
Hey, where did you get that?

808
01:11:08,893 --> 01:11:10,919
Mighty Mole? Here is your gold!

809
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:15,916
Santa Maria stole it from you!
He is also the murderer of your son.

810
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:18,431
I saw it with my own eyes.

811
01:11:18,531 --> 01:11:20,995
But where is Santa Maria?

812
01:11:27,527 --> 01:11:32,078
Oh well, Abahachi did not murder
my son Rabid Rabbit!

813
01:11:32,127 --> 01:11:35,164
But what about Hillarious Hare?

814
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:37,153
Oh, difficult.

815
01:11:37,253 --> 01:11:39,200
I think I got something for you!

816
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:52,954
You look absolutely lovely, darling!

817
01:11:53,054 --> 01:11:54,842
Thank you!

818
01:11:55,007 --> 01:11:59,000
Yes, so do you. But you may
want to try horizontal stripes.

819
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,750
Really accents your figure.

820
01:11:59,047 --> 01:12:03,723
I'll go get some drinks at the Prosecco store.
I'll be back in a bit.

821
01:12:03,767 --> 01:12:06,725
Ok, kids, now off with...

822
01:12:07,807 --> 01:12:08,951
Uschi.

823
01:12:09,051 --> 01:12:10,196
Yes?

824
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:13,717
I think I know now where I belong.

825
01:12:14,007 --> 01:12:15,811
Oh, Ranger!

826
01:12:15,911 --> 01:12:17,716
You know, I thought...

827
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:21,760
Yes, I know! You and
Abahachi must move on!

828
01:12:21,807 --> 01:12:23,213
What?

829
01:12:23,313 --> 01:12:24,719
The country needs you!

830
01:12:24,847 --> 01:12:29,875
No, just a sec. I meant to
say that you and me...

831
01:12:29,927 --> 01:12:34,921
Both of us now and the child...
We're a family now...

832
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:37,596
Family is all well and good

833
01:12:37,696 --> 01:12:40,325
But you must not shy away
from your responsibilities!

834
01:12:40,367 --> 01:12:43,803
There is a blood brother
out there waiting for you!

835
01:12:44,447 --> 01:12:48,918
Together you'll fight for peace,
freedom, and justice!

836
01:12:49,847 --> 01:12:55,365
Found national parks!
Free the afro-american inhabitants,

837
01:12:55,447 --> 01:12:58,644
out there from the shackles of slavery!

838
01:12:59,367 --> 01:13:03,724
So that one day it will say
on page 1 of some history book:

839
01:13:03,767 --> 01:13:09,364
This book belongs to Peter Miller,
class of Miss Sanz.

840
01:13:12,327 --> 01:13:15,842
I'll do all of that, but can you
help me out of this?

841
01:13:16,367 --> 01:13:19,677
Well, Ranger, would you please come...

842
01:13:19,767 --> 01:13:22,174
Abahachi, could you give me a hand here?

843
01:13:22,274 --> 01:13:24,682
No! That'll be the day!

844
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:40,760
You saved my life and
gave a saloon to my tribe.

845
01:13:40,807 --> 01:13:42,713
Dimitri, my brother!

846
01:13:42,813 --> 01:13:44,720
Abahachi, my brother!

847
01:13:50,127 --> 01:13:53,119
I am an indian!

848
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,333
Good evening.

849
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:57,919
Good evening. Good evening.

850
01:13:57,967 --> 01:14:01,960
What's the toy of the weasel?
Easel, easel.

851
01:14:02,007 --> 01:14:07,001
In 1879, Karl May published
his first Wild West novel.

852
01:14:07,047 --> 01:14:08,993
It becomes a bestseller!

853
01:14:09,093 --> 01:14:11,040
Later that year he returned

854
01:14:11,087 --> 01:14:15,524
to Germany and married the daughter
of a theater director in Bad Segeberg.

855
01:14:15,567 --> 01:14:16,876
Bless you!

856
01:14:16,976 --> 01:14:18,286
A year later,

857
01:14:18,607 --> 01:14:22,600
Frederico Enrico Nico Gonzalez
Desperado del Torro-Hombre

858
01:14:22,647 --> 01:14:27,641
files a patent for the BBQ ashtray.

859
01:14:27,687 --> 01:14:32,397
Dec 24, 1879: Santa Maria's brother
Santa Claus brings gifts for children

860
01:14:32,607 --> 01:14:37,601
to compensate for the
deeds of his brother.

861
01:14:37,647 --> 01:14:41,720
1882: Winnetouch founds the
designer label "Think Pink".

862
01:14:41,767 --> 01:14:43,594
Ok, done!

863
01:14:43,694 --> 01:14:45,521
Mighty Mole is now Mighty Hare!

864
01:14:48,047 --> 01:14:52,086
Oh my, he can wear that...
with his figure!

865
01:14:52,127 --> 01:14:57,121
On July 4, 1884, an indian chief
is arrested in New York

866
01:14:57,167 --> 01:15:01,399
wearing a rabbit costume.
He's deported to a reservation.

867
01:15:04,767 --> 01:15:09,602
Only four months later,
Stan Laurel is born.

868
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:15,958
All of that, Abahachi and
Ranger never knew.

869
01:15:19,767 --> 01:15:24,204
What do you say?
Swing by the Grand Canyon?

870
01:15:24,247 --> 01:15:28,718
While we're there we can found a
national park for afro-american immigrants.

871
01:15:28,767 --> 01:15:30,696
What? Who?

872
01:15:30,796 --> 01:15:32,726
Tell me, whom do you know?

873
01:15:32,807 --> 01:15:34,873
Well, Old Shatterhand, for example.

874
01:15:34,973 --> 01:15:37,039
Well, everybody knows him.

875
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,136
Then go ride somewhere else.

876
01:15:39,236 --> 01:15:41,285
You go ride somewhere else!

877
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:49,736
Come on, we don't need no Ranger!

878
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:51,726
Abahachi...

879
01:15:51,807 --> 01:15:53,213
Yes?

880
01:15:53,313 --> 01:15:54,719
I cannot go with you.

881
01:15:54,847 --> 01:15:56,883
Why?

882
01:16:04,087 --> 01:16:08,160
You must be Ranger!
The man with the squint!

883
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:10,518
Shit!

884
01:16:11,527 --> 01:16:14,519
I need to show you something.

885
01:16:16,327 --> 01:16:18,318
Later!

886
01:16:28,367 --> 01:16:32,599
Abahachi is a murderer!
Hold on a sec! Big misunderstanding!

887
01:16:32,647 --> 01:16:38,995
Yes, very big! Chief, no, white palefaces... shit.

888
01:16:53,127 --> 01:16:56,199
We got lucky with
the weather, right?

889
01:16:58,327 --> 01:17:00,273
What are you doing?

890
01:17:00,373 --> 01:17:02,320
What should I be doing?

891
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:06,360
Here's where your plan is wrong!
Well and you can kiss my butt!

892
01:17:23,207 --> 01:17:28,042
I quote: saloon in mint condition,
quiet fee... quiet location...

893
01:17:28,087 --> 01:17:32,126
Once again: we had an appointment
with a realtor from Wyoming.

894
01:17:32,167 --> 01:17:36,718
Shortly before I read his ad in the paper.
I quote: saloon in mint condition,

895
01:17:36,767 --> 01:17:40,999
No fees... available immediately...
Can't be! Cut!

896
01:17:55,327 --> 01:18:00,720
Did you hear that? A man
got hit with a stone...

897
01:18:01,447 --> 01:18:06,441
But boss! It's John.
Remember, you sent him to bed?

898
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:08,958
Ah, right!

899
01:18:09,887 --> 01:18:12,879
l am a clucking hen...

900
01:18:13,847 --> 01:18:18,363
I used to own a beauty farm.
Really quite cozy.

901
01:18:18,407 --> 01:18:21,399
Wouldn't have hurt you either.

902
01:18:21,567 --> 01:18:25,560
And this is Uschi.
What a woman!

903
01:18:33,927 --> 01:18:36,760
Ow! You crazy?

904
01:18:49,047 --> 01:18:52,039
Final cut!

905
01:20:21,527 --> 01:20:23,518
Oh my, oh my, oh my...

906
01:20:24,407 --> 01:20:28,400
See, Jacqueline, that's
what you get from that.

907
01:20:28,447 --> 01:20:32,725
So much effort and then
they all just go home.

908
01:20:32,767 --> 01:20:37,522
We're probably stuck with
the cake again.

909
01:20:37,567 --> 01:20:41,560
Too bad about the prosecco.
They are such ignorants.

910
01:26:57,000 --> 01:20:45,600
They don't even know how hard
it is to get a Prosecco around here.

911
01:20:45,647 --> 01:20:49,640
Don't even mention the ice!

912
01:20:49,687 --> 01:20:53,726
And if you don't have firewater,
all hell is let lose.

913
01:20:53,767 --> 01:20:57,760
Just like with the floaties I got
for Abahachi back in the day.

914
01:20:57,807 --> 01:21:01,800
First he had to have them.
Two weeks later he didn't care anymore.

915
01:21:01,847 --> 01:21:05,840
Say, have we taken the wrong path?
I think we need to go left.

916
01:21:05,887 --> 01:21:10,119
Jacqueline, not so fast!
Or you'll barf again!
