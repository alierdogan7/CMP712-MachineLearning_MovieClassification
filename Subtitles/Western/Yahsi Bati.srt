1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,919
So when the woman says
they come long and thin, fat...

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,719
...with veins on them,
like this and like that...

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,799
...the guy can't handle it. He gets up
and says, " If I found one like that..."

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,159
-" ...I'd, you know..."
-He's something else!

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,359
They used to call them 'zibiks'.
They were like coffee mills. This big.

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,399
And made of wood, right?
Or so I hear, I never saw one.

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,879
I haven't laughed so much in ages.
Let's drink, Vedat.

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,799
-Cheers!
-Welcome, old man.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,719
-Welcome.
-To your health.

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,239
Zeki, why don't we, you know..?

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,719
Right. Enough laughs. Let's not
keep Vedat hanging on any longer.

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,999
Oh man! You had to
put them in a plastic bag?

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,039
Hey, the wrapping has to be crap
or they'd attract attention. Right?

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,239
Sure.

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,119
Here, these are the goods.

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,319
Just look at that stitching.
It speaks for itself.

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,719
-So can I touch them?
-Sure.. Here you go.

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,079
They call these long Wellingtons.
They're around 1 30-1 40 years old.

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,399
I can't give an exact figure,
but around that.

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,119
-So how did they land up with you?
-Now that's an interesting story.

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,719
Go on, tell him. Vedat's one of us.
There's no one around. It's just us.

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,679
-OK, US president Garfield...
-What, the cat?

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,839
-What fucking cat?
-Garfield's a cat, right?

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,479
Google it, man! See for yourself.
The then US president was Garfield.

25
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,279
OK, I enter 'Garfield'.
'Did you mean Garfield?' The cat again.

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,839
Where's the president?
Away. On vacation.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,679
-Carry on, chum.
-Alpay...

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,359
Just carry on.

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,639
Vedat, the US president
sends our sultan a gift.

30
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,919
And the sultan thinks,
" I'll send a gift back."

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,079
My great-grandfather, Aziz Vefa,
a member of the secret services...

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,559
...and another public servant,
Lemi Galip, from the treasury.

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,159
He gives them a mission.
What does he say?

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,479
He says, "Take this gift
to the president."

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,559
-So they go to the palace.
-The palace?

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,879
What do you think? They'd meet
the sultan down at the waterside?

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,959
-So they go to the palace.
-OK. Get on with it, will you?

38
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,999
I am, but learn to listen first.

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,399
Telling a story is just as much
about being listened to.

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,279
Oh, right.

41
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,559
They come before the sultan.
And they kiss the sultan's hands.

42
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,199
-Does the sultan kiss theirs?
-Come on, man! Stop butting in.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,759
They're presented the gift right away.
What is it? A diamond necklace.

44
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,279
And the sultan says,
" It's in your hands now."

45
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,719
"And here's 1 000 bucks for the road.
Confederation dollars."

46
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,319
Well, you can't say, "Sorry, padishah.
America's miles away. No can do."

47
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,879
You have to go
come hell or high water.

48
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,439
Now they've got the mission
their route's a given.

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,639
First, the Orient Express to Paris.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,999
Then a boat to London.

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,479
And then another boat
across the Atlantic to America.

52
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,119
THE MILD WEST

53
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,559
S'il vous plait, madame.

54
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,159
Our honourable jerk
didn't get the joke, Aziz.

55
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,519
Ask if Mr and Mrs Brown
are back from the picnic.

56
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,519
Give me a break!
The humour's way too subtle.

57
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,279
English peasant!

58
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,399
I'm saying we prize
our village people.

59
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,439
They always say that.
It's the only thing they know.

60
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,719
She says she can keep secrets.

61
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,439
Keep those secrets
when we stop for a break.

62
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,799
Suppose we stop
and pass a little water?

63
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,719
What the hell are you doing?

64
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,919
-What's the problem?
-You can't share it round like candy!

65
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,479
-Well, you did it with that photo.
-Put the damn thing back!

66
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,319
OK. Don't get so steamed up!
I'm responsible for it.

67
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,079
Bandits! Keep calm.

68
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,239
Don't point that at me!

69
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,999
Listen. We'll follow
the normal routine. Calm down.

70
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,159
Listen. We'll draw straws.
The diamond or the money? Quick!

71
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,839
-We're in deep water, Aziz Efendi!
-Draw a straw!

72
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,119
The diamond.

73
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,799
-There's armies of them, Aziz Efendi!
-Stay calm. Calm down. Stay calm.

74
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,719
-I am calm!
-Stay calm.

75
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,479
In the name of Allah,
most gracious, most merciful..

76
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,839
Dear God, don't desert us!

77
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,919
We're not giving up the diamond
even if it means death!

78
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,599
-Let's go, main man!
-With the will of Allah..

79
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,519
I said stop the carriage,
you son of a bitch!

80
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,159
Hey, Zeki. I got kind of lost
from the mail carriage onwards.

81
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,639
Wait. Let's try this then.

82
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,039
Didn't I say stop the carriage,
you fuckers?

83
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,079
Get out! Out, out, out!

84
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,239
Get out of there! Out!

85
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,439
-Come on, move it!
-Oh God, Jack! No!

86
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,439
-Stop! Get off her!
-Don't shout. Stand in line.

87
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,719
Ladies and gentlemen, Johnny Lesh here.
My crew and I are here...

88
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,919
...to relieve you of certain items
for the comfort of your journey.

89
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,519
You're free to shout.
Any heroics and you're dead.

90
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,759
The gun's antique. I put in for
a new one and does anyone give a fuck?

91
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,599
Come here, asshole! Move!
Get over there!

92
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,679
Lesh! Check out this chick!

93
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,159
A watch!

94
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,879
Don't take us for wasters, sir.
We've come all the way from Istanbul.

95
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,759
Oh yeah?.. It shows.

96
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,599
I never saw kit like that
even in Buffalo Bill's show.

97
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,799
What the hell is this?

98
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,519
A fez. I have a flute as well
if you want.

99
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,119
Knock it off!

100
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,119
Don't..!

101
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,199
-Lesh!
-What the hell have you done?

102
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,079
This is unreal!

103
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,919
But we're in with Firecracker Ahmet
of Highwayman Creek. Be warned!

104
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,919
Come on, let's go!
I smell Indians.

105
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,719
See you!

106
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,239
-He said "Sioux" . The Sioux..
-No, he said "see you" as in goodbye.

107
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,439
Who the hell is Firecracker Ahmet?

108
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,639
Any time I mention the guy's name
it always gets me in trouble anyhow.

109
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,319
Don't make me crazy, mon cher!
The instructions are explicit.

110
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,439
In case of danger, hide the goods
up your nether region. It's that clear!

111
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,279
But is that fair?
A diamond that big?

112
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,159
Hey, you think it's a turn-on
stuffing 1 000 dollars up my ass?

113
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,799
-I wouldn't know.
-What?

114
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,839
Sir thinks his ass is too precious
and I'm about to get massacred here!

115
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,959
Come here!

116
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,799
Open up that handkerchief.

117
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,999
Here.

118
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,719
Terrific!

119
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,319
There should be a saucer for this.

120
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,239
Here, that's all.

121
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,399
Are you OK?

122
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,319
At least we held on to the grand.

123
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,679
It's not the time for jokes,
but the old boy's stuffed us.

124
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,679
Carry on and you're dead!
We face the arrows of misfortune here.

125
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,279
Indians!

126
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,639
-Oogh!
-What's "oogh" ?

127
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,039
I think they use animal names.
Mole-cricket..

128
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,879
I'm Richard Thomas. I'm at Oxford.
I just spend summers with my tribe.

129
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,559
Look, we come from Istanbul.
They say Indians are Turks, right?

130
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,359
-Kenan, is that true?
-No way. Get their kit off.

131
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,479
I'll take it off myself.

132
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,439
What if I say we bear greetings
from Apache Selim of Kasımpaşa?

133
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,079
I can do it.

134
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,119
Here you go..
Lemi Bey!

135
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,839
Hopefully they won't fuck us.

136
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,719
-Here you are, Kenan Bey.
-Oh my God!

137
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,399
-Aziz, suppose we notify the consulate?
-We can do that.

138
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,479
Does that thing round your neck
have any particular meaning?

139
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,559
My mum gave it to me. She said
it would keep all danger at bay.

140
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,599
Hello! It's an emergency, my friend.
Get this wired to Istanbul right away.

141
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,399
-Is this an 'A'?
-Can't you read or write either?

142
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,679
-Give it here.
-You do it.

143
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,959
If Lucky Luke showed up now,
you'd be kissing his goddamn ass.

144
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,959
Lucky Luke?
Who gives a toss about him?

145
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,039
-Any telegrams for me?
-Hey, my friend! Welcome.

146
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,119
Have a seat over there.
Geoffrey, grab us a couple of teas!

147
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,999
After a while, a reply
comes through from the palace.

148
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,439
What does it say?

149
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,039
No need to come back. Mail us
the head of the officer responsible.

150
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,959
OK then.

151
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,439
Cut off my head and mail it.
You shouldn't get grief for this.

152
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,719
I'm responsible.

153
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,679
How am I supposed to do it?

154
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,839
I don't know.

155
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,079
Strangle me with rope first.

156
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,639
Pass on my greetings to my mum.

157
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,639
Hey, America!
What happened to that dream?

158
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,399
Hey, that needs a splash of water.

159
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,519
Shut up! We're in this shit together
and we'll pay for it together.

160
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,479
Aziz, you'll be exiled to Timbuktu.

161
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,159
Just look around. We're fucking
in Timbuktu! Who needs to be exiled?

162
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,279
We're not dying
before we find that diamond. OK?

163
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,359
For a week or so
they roam around totally broke.

164
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,679
They think about getting guns
and going after the diamond thieves.

165
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,079
But then guns don't come for a kiss.
And they don't have a dime.

166
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,159
Fuck off, dicko!

167
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,559
Then they dream up a venture or two
that will feed them at least.

168
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,359
I say venture, but of course
not the kind that needs capital.

169
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,039
Horse washing! In and out!

170
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,319
Good health to your horse!

171
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,599
Horse washing!

172
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,199
Having got their hands dirty
in a couple of shitty ventures...

173
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,839
...Aziz Efendi gets an idea.
"Why don't we do what we're good at?"

174
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,519
Now for the best-loved characters
with their best-loved quirks..!

175
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,479
-Karagöz dear, have a good Ramadan!
-Clear off, nincompoop!

176
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,959
Don't be like that, Karagöz.
It's the holy month of Ramadan!

177
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,679
Don't worry, gasbag Hacı!
My whole family's behind you.

178
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,239
This was the hottest show
in Sultanahmet last year.

179
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,039
Let's have a few laughs!

180
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,239
Sorry, it's not funny.

181
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,999
Try being open to new things.
This is shadow theatre!

182
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,559
-We'd laugh if it was funny, right?
-I agree.

183
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,199
OK.. I'll do you Moliere next year.
Moliere's 'The Miser'.

184
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,319
I did Blustering Drunkard Bekir,
I did the Dwarf.

185
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,959
They didn't laugh at one of them!

186
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,799
-But they laughed at your lady, huh?
-So? And up until then?

187
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,719
They have no sense of humour.
American humour! Fuck that!

188
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,719
The jokes get lost
in translation of course.

189
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,359
Give me a break!

190
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,439
Eggs.. Save those.
What's in that over there?

191
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,639
Sugar.

192
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,879
Lemons.. Sugar..
Lemons and sugar.

193
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,279
Candy!.. Roll up, roll up!.. Candy!

194
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,999
Here you go. Enjoy!

195
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,919
-Candy!
-Do me one.

196
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,479
-Your wish is my command!
-Wind it round this, not that!

197
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,959
-It's Ottoman candy. It might be heavy.
-Shut the fuck up!

198
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,839
There's nothing they don't do
to scrape together 1 00 dollars.

199
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,399
They even show cartoons
on a contraption Lemi rigged up.

200
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,839
I'm talking cartoons! Walt Disney
isn't around yet, nor Mickey Mouse.

201
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,879
Watch up, watch up! A love story!
As real as life itself!

202
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,359
I'Il tell you something,
but don't get the wrong idea.

203
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,599
They find that formula. You know
the one that's said to be secret?

204
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,119
-What's that?
-Cola of course!

205
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,719
Liquorice, bicarbonate of soda..
And the base is syrup anyway.

206
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,959
Hold it, I'm not with you.
They really invent cola?

207
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,279
Sure they do, but..

208
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,639
Aziz!

209
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,879
What do you think?

210
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,959
Wow! Fabulous! Fabulous!
Look..

211
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,919
Try it.

212
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,479
What do you reckon?

213
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,279
Exquisite!

214
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,439
Aziz, should I write this
on the pitcher?.. 'Drink Cold'.

215
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,359
Forget it. Leave people alone.
Let them drink it how they like.

216
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,799
Drink up, drink up!
Ice-cold cola!

217
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,799
Thanks. Enjoy!
Ice-cold cola!

218
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,519
Drink up, drink up!

219
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,199
If only I could afford some..
It needs a drink on the side..

220
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,039
Anyone hungry?
Ice-cold cola!

221
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,239
Let me get the money for that.
There you go, my friend.

222
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,559
The thighs are still cooking.
I'll give you a wing instead.

223
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,799
Give me change for this.

224
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,559
-If only I could afford one..
-Shame on you! What's with the yelling?

225
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,079
You're a trader, right? So try yelling.
The creaking wheel gets the grease.

226
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,399
We're Kentucky boys.
Cut the bullshit!

227
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,879
And we're Samatya boys.
You're trying to bullshit..?

228
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,079
Get off me! Get off!

229
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,559
I'll get you with this bottle!

230
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,919
Get off!

231
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,759
Oh God!

232
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,919
So they're trying to seIl
chicken sandwiches in Kentucky.

233
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,159
Like they'd get away with it..
The guys are in business there.

234
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,319
They'd give anyone else a chance?
You recognise him?

235
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,879
-Who do you mean?
-Who do you think?

236
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,959
The guy on the logo.
I'm not plugging him here.

237
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,639
For our guys
it was yet another let-down.

238
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,559
A solder job and it'll be fine.

239
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,119
Redneck assholes, they won't
let us do an honest day's work!

240
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,039
How much have we got?

241
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,439
-Around 50-55 dollars.
-Hand it over.

242
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,599
I'll get a pistol
and go to town with them!

243
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,159
Enough crap! I've woken up
from that American dream at last!

244
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,079
Aziz Efendi, you're a wanted man.

245
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,879
I'll find that fucker Johnny Lesh
and finish him off too.

246
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,639
-Aziz Efendi, you're a wanted man.
-Come on! It's just luck, that's all.

247
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,559
No, not like that.
You have a price on your head.

248
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,959
Ah!

249
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,519
It's the spitting image!

250
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,519
-Ten dollars. Can we get that?
-You bet we will!

251
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,679
Horse.. Horse Whisper..
Horse Whisperer.

252
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,599
Horse means 'at'!

253
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,399
How about this one?
Johnny Lesh.. 500 dollars.

254
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,519
So he's on the wanted list,
the son of a bitch!

255
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,239
Let's just get that pitcher fixed.

256
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,199
Hello there, sheriff.

257
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,879
I'm Lenny the bounty hunter.

258
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,639
-I want 1 0 dollars for the cowboy.
-Which cowboy?

259
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,599
-The horse-fu**ing cowboy.
-What are you talking about?

260
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,319
-You know, the horse whisperer.
-You sick bastard! You pervert, you!

261
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,599
But I didn't do a thing.
The horse started it.

262
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,199
Sheriff, it's your job to put
perverts like this behind bars.

263
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,279
Lou, lock up the animal.

264
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,519
He should be kept away
from stables a while, asshole!

265
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,959
Here, your 1 0 dollars.

266
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,919
This is peanuts.
I'm really after Johnny Lesh.

267
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,919
Johnny Lesh? Are you kidding?
I'd retire if I found him.

268
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,799
Here. 500 dollars.

269
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,439
-Would you care for some cola?
-Cola?.. It's a drink?

270
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,919
Here you go, sheriff.

271
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,759
Won't you have some too?

272
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,559
Whoa!

273
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,599
Sheriff Cheko?

274
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,879
Here, Timothy the horse thief.

275
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,239
Timothy the horse thief, huh?

276
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,519
How old are you?

277
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,439
Open your mouth! Open up!

278
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,999
-He's not worth a red cent.
-Twenty dollars!

279
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,839
Ten dollars.

280
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,719
I hate horse thieves, Timothy.

281
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,359
-OK, 1 0 dollars, 10 dollars.
-It's a deal?

282
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,239
Lock him up!

283
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,439
Sheriff, would you care for a cola?

284
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,999
Cola?

285
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,079
Go on then.

286
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,919
Whoops!

287
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,399
You?

288
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,999
It's ice-cold.

289
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,799
May it work its wonders.

290
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,839
Johnny Lesh.. 900 dollars.

291
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,279
He goes up faster than the dollar,
son of a bitch.

292
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,199
Psst, listen. Put 1 00 dollars,
not some piddling amount.

293
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,959
We'll say he robbed a train.

294
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,319
-Aziz Efendi, what about the name?
-What name?

295
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,039
Get writing. 'Jack Daniel'.
It's our last job anyway.

296
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,159
Tomorrow we're on the train
to White Lake.

297
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,879
-Jack...
-...Daniel.

298
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,559
Daniel.
Train robber Jack.

299
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,319
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

300
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,919
Almighty God, have mercy on
the soul of Thy departed servant.

301
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,799
And let us, who mourn him,
pray for his soul.

302
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,879
Lord, protect and watch over him.
Amen.

303
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,039
Take it easy there!
May God forgive his sins, brother.

304
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,239
Father, not brother.

305
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,279
We're after the sheriff actually.

306
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,839
I'm Sheriff Murphy.

307
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,919
Sheriff, I've brought you
train robber Jack.

308
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,199
-Train robber Jack?
-Train robber Jack.

309
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,799
-Train robber Jack..
-Aha.

310
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,799
You hear that, Jack?
The guys says he's caught you!

311
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,119
God damn you!
Just get this over with!

312
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,239
-That's train robber Jack?
-Just our fucking luck!

313
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,839
-The train robber was your idea.
-And whose idea was Jack Daniel?

314
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,319
It was me who laughed at
'train robber Jack', was it?

315
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,079
Sheriff, allow me
to offer you a cola.

316
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,999
Wait! There's carbon dioxide inside!
Carbon dioxide! Agh! Oh my God!

317
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,319
Roll them in tar and feathers
and lock them up!

318
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,519
Come here! Get moving!

319
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,079
Relieve yourselves in this pot.
Don't get bird shit everywhere.

320
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,479
-Are you wearing that talisman?
-Yes.

321
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,039
The one that keeps away danger?

322
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,159
Gambling, was it?

323
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,599
God give me patience...

324
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,759
This is the calm before the storm.
There are greater things to come..

325
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,279
Man, does there have to be
one of you in every jail?

326
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,759
Johnny Lesh!

327
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,839
Who'd have thought a gunslinger
like him would land up here?

328
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,279
-There goes our 1 000 dollars.
-That's bullshit!

329
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,839
The diamond's come back by itself.

330
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,639
Friend.. Can I have that
if you're not eating it?

331
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,399
Get to work! Come on!

332
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,359
Get to work!

333
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,839
If they left us alone for a second
I'd smash his face in.

334
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,599
But they're always looking.

335
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,919
Calm down. We'll follow the routine.
There's no rush.

336
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,239
This is the calm before the storm.
It doesn't bode well.

337
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,199
Get out of here!
Clear off!

338
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,599
Hey, chickens!.. Water!

339
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,559
You mentioned the routine, right?
What do we do?

340
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,759
Don't rush things.
More haste, less speed.

341
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,759
Slow and steady wins the race.
Listen.

342
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,079
-Lemi!
-Aziz Efendi!

343
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,199
That was some hail of bullets!

344
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,119
It's so dark in there.

345
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,639
Water, anyone?

346
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,559
-I guess not.
-Lesh. Lesh!

347
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,119
Lesh, don't die!
You can't die yet! Wait!

348
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,159
Where's the diamond?
Tell us where the diamond is.

349
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,479
-Out with it!
-Where's the diamond?

350
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,119
-Bea...
-Bill.. Give him some water.

351
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,759
What's bill? Bill? What's bill?
Pacos Bill?

352
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,919
-Buffalo Bill!
-Come on, bill what?

353
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,039
-Akbil travel cards?
-Bill?

354
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,319
Bea..ts me.

355
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,519
Asshole, I'll kill you!
You can't die! I'll kill you!

356
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,439
-Cannon...
-Bill Cannon? Bill Cannon?

357
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,399
-Cannon? Cannon?
-Cannon... ball...

358
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,839
Cannonball. What's Cannonball?
Local or import?

359
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,959
-Siii...
-Say the first bit! The first bit!

360
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,399
Sii-ouux...

361
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,359
Sioux! He said Sioux! The Sioux!

362
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,519
No, man! It was "see you" ,
like " I'm dead." It was "see you" !

363
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,679
He timed that death so badly.

364
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,759
Ah, poor thing!
His horse is all sad.

365
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,319
-Horses are such sensitive animals.
-Right.

366
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,839
Aziz Efendi?

367
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,799
You're Johnny Lesh. You broke jail.
You're worth 2000 dollars.

368
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,599
OK.

369
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,119
Here.

370
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,599
Agh!

371
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,839
This is the calm before the storm.
There are greater things to come.

372
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,759
I'm knocking him off.

373
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,479
Let's see what Cannonball
is all about then..

374
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,719
I'd never have imagined this.
Galatasaray High School, Robert College...

375
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,119
...four years' training
at the finance ministry...

376
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,719
...and look at me now.

377
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,959
Well, put it in your memoirs.

378
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,319
We only had to deliver the diamond,
be wined and dined and get back.

379
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,599
But we've been in shit the whole way.
Look, I still have fluff in my mouth.

380
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,199
So I need to reconsider
my admiration for the west.

381
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,439
My dear friend, why do you make
such a big thing about the west?

382
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,279
1 00 years ago
Versailles Palace had no toilets.

383
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,999
The king shat straight on the floor.

384
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,399
The waltz was only invented
so people didn't step in shit.

385
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,359
They always say that.
So what went wrong after that?

386
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,479
Well, the printing press didn't
get to us till late, and so on..

387
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,559
-What's going on?
-Get off, get off!

388
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,519
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

389
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,079
Whoa!

390
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,279
Keep calm.

391
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,839
-Is that really a woman?
-Sure.

392
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,599
Watch where she's firing.
You can tell from that.

393
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,039
Aziz Efendi, what's going on?
I sense a new admiration for the west.

394
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,439
The thing is to take on
the good things about the west.

395
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,599
Hey, take off those guns.
Remember, you're a captive.

396
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,359
Glasses!

397
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,119
Hello there, pretty lady!
We loved watching your target practice.

398
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,319
Really?

399
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,639
But watching the Suzan Van Dyke show
doesn't come for free.

400
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,319
Toss over some change.

401
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,879
We're clean out of money.
How about a coffee instead?

402
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,799
Coffee, huh?

403
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,839
-Suzan Van Dyke.
-Aziz Vef.. Zozo the Kid. Three words.

404
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,919
The coffee's with the horses.
Let me run off and get it right now.

405
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,679
-She's like a man! A real turn-off.
-I'd lay her for what it's worth.

406
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,439
The coffee foam is fine,
your marksmanship divine..

407
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,959
Thanks.

408
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,399
I've been into it since I was 3.
I did 5 years in Buffalo Bill's Show.

409
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,239
Shooting, lassos, cooking, trickshot..
Then I did some time at a hotel.

410
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,919
Van Dyke..

411
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,199
What brute of a cowboy
puts you to work like this?

412
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,319
What cowboy?
There is no cowboy.

413
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,559
Did you drop this by any chance?

414
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,199
Yes.

415
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,679
Lesbo..

416
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,799
-Someone important, I guess.
-Right... Someone I love.

417
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,759
So which way are you heading?

418
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,879
Well, I'm a bounty hunter,
on my way to turn in Johnny Lesh.

419
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,719
-Goddamn it! What are you saying?
-What is this? Hold it!

420
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,239
-Johnny Lesh! Finally. You, huh?
-No! Aziz, tell her!

421
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,439
-Suzan, please...
-Wait, Miss Suzan!

422
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,599
Out of the way or I'll kill you too!
No, stay right there!

423
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,319
Wait! No! He's not Johnny Lesh!
It's a lie! We're Ottomans!

424
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,279
-He's a fake! To get the reward!
-Really I'm not him, or American even.

425
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,879
I'm Ottoman. An Istanbul boy.
I speak four languages.

426
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,399
-Ottoman?
-Ottoman. You know, the palace, music..

427
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,399
Folk plays.. The harem..

428
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,639

-İbiş sweetie, we have guests coming.
-Fine, but coming to see me?

429
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,559
-Great food, stuffed leaves, lamb stews..
-Stuffed eggplant..

430
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,399
The Hippodrome, Sultanahmet,
Ramadan festivities..

431
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,839
Look, the lights between minarets!

432
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,199
-If only we had them here!
-Sultan of the 1 1 months..

433
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,319
Lords and ladies, let's repair
to the river for drinks..

434
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,519
We'll pull those oars
and have a merry time.

435
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,119
An old mansion..
The fire brigade.. A fire..

436
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,519
-Guard, where's the fire?
-In my heart! In my heart!

437
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,279
-The gangsters of Galata, Tophane..
-I killed my mother and my father!

438
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,879
-Do the Arab maid.
-What does young madam fancy tonight?

439
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,479
Not like that.
Make it more nasal.

440
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,479
Young madam, I haven't cooked a thing
and the larder's empty.

441
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,119
Isn't that a bit fierce?

442
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,639
Some soot on my face
and I'd be the perfect Arab maid!

443
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,839
A headscarf would do the trick too.

444
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,159
Ah! Lokum.. Turkish delight! Lokum!

445
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,919
I didn't get the Arab maid,
but lokum makes sense.

446
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,239
-Here you go.
-Turkish delight..

447
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,119
-Lokum originates from us after all.
-Hmmm..

448
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,319
-You believe I'm not Johnny Lesh, right?
-I believe you.

449
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,279
Miss Suzan, we have another thing.
If a gun is pulled, it has to fire.

450
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,599
Oh, right.

451
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,279
It's nothing. Just a graze.
Get up, get up.

452
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,319
Hang on in there, Aziz Efendi.

453
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,279
Agh!

454
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,599
-Aggh!
-OK, OK. Keep still. OK.

455
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,279
Is that alcohol?

456
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,439
Agh! Oh God!

457
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,439
-So Lesh is dead, huh?
-Yes. We saw for ourselves.

458
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,599
Aziz Efendi buried the body
with his own hands.

459
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,159
I wish I'd killed him myself.
Johnny Lesh murdered my mother.

460
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,399
My mother.. Mary Lou.

461
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,319
Ohh!.. Agh!.. Ugh!

462
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,519
-God!
-Pass that over.

463
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,639
Johnny Lesh shafted us too.

464
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,599
We'd arrived with the sultan's gift.
Something worth thousands.

465
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,839
We're in the mail coach.
And suddenly, bandits!

466
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,999
It's, "Stop the carriage,
you son of a bitch!"

467
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,639
Aziz Efendi panics,
I'm brave as can be.

468
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,959
-We draw straws and...
-Skip the details, asshole!

469
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,159
My idea was to make Lemi Johnny Lesh,
turn him in and get back 2000 dollars.

470
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,319
You should cross the river.
Lesh is too well-known this side.

471
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,639
I'd say go to Cannonball.

472
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,199
-Cannonball?
-Cannonball.. See you..

473
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,639
Ah!

474
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,879
You'd get 2000 dollars for Lesh there.
The sheriff's a jerk.

475
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,439
Hurrah!

476
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,639
Right.. But I get 1 000 of that.

477
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,799
That's fine.

478
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,079
Hey, it's a photo of her mum.
Gossip monger!

479
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,959
You know they say
hearsay is half lies?

480
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,959
And you let her have
1 000 dollars just like that.

481
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,999
I'd give my life for her.

482
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,079
She's like a man. Not my type.

483
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,879
Yeah, right. Check out that back.
Just like our street porter, Hasan.

484
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,319
Ahem..

485
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,439
Listen, which hand do you use
to write your memoirs?

486
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,559
Good. Let me tie up those hands
so I get a decent night's sleep.

487
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,039
-Don't you have any trust left?
-No.

488
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,199
Hey! I expect you at evening prayer.
Got it? Don't drive me mental!

489
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,679
Here, stick this gun out of the way.

490
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,839
If it's not keeping law and order...

491
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,039
...it's priest duties at the church.

492
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,359
I don't have five minutes to sit down.
I'm just back from a funeral.

493
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,799
Chuck, run over to the church
with some candles.

494
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,879
The assholes keep nicking them.

495
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,839
Yes, welcome.

496
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,119
-Sheriff Lloyd?
-That's me.

497
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,079
We've come to pick up a reward.

498
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,079
How about a whisky first?
My own home-brew.

499
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,039
Or.. Chuck! Run over
and get us some ice-cold cola!

500
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,919
-Cola?
-Yes. It's new.

501
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,839
You know how it tastes?
Awesome!

502
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,799
They've bottled the stuff.

503
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,439
It's a total rip-off.

504
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,359
Anyway, sheriff.
Let's talk business.

505
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,879
We've brought you Johnny Lesh.

506
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,119
Johnny Lesh..

507
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,319
Is this for real?
You're not kidding, right?

508
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,679
-Chuck, you hear that? Johnny Lesh..
-When do we get the money?

509
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,759
The money? What goddamn money?
Are you insane, man?

510
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,439
On a day like this,
at a time like this...

511
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,919
...at a moment when we most need
to join forces and stand together...

512
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,799
...you're asking me to lock up
a hero like Johnny Lesh?

513
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,799
I sent a message with the Fargos' boy.
You got it, right?

514
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,839
What's going on?

515
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,879
Sheriff, you're breaking the law.
We demand the reward right now!

516
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,719
To hell with your reward!
The money's with me. Don't worry.

517
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,759
But I can't lock up Johnny Lesh.

518
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,439
The Sioux have fucked us over.

519
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,719
Look!

520
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,199
-Ugh! They scalped him!
-Right.. Not long ago.

521
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,359
It only happened yesterday.
They wreak havoc on a regular basis.

522
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,119
Have a seat.

523
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,359
Look, if anyone can deal with this,
it's Johnny Lesh.

524
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,719
You're white too.
You should have some sympathy.

525
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:20,879
Chuck!

526
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,279
Hey, don't high-five me
every time I say your name, hick!

527
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,639
Run and tell the hotel...

528
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,359
...Johnny Lesh is on his way
with our bounty hunter guests.

529
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,199
There we go!

530
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,999
Come with me, my man.

531
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,439
Sheriff!

532
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,519
Macaulay!

533
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,999
Take Johnny Lesh to the hotel.

534
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,279
Give him a good wash inside and out.

535
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,879
Sure, sheriff.
This way!

536
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,479
-Don't say he's forgetting the reward.
-Not so fast. We'll talk.

537
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,999
Isn't the lady coming to the hotel?
Please! Make yourself at home.

538
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,079
I could do with a hot bath.

539
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,399
I'm getting my 1 000 dollars,
like it or not.

540
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,239
OK, OK.
She seems like a go-getting type.

541
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,359
Right, she's a go-getter,
but will we get that reward?

542
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,239
Sure you will. Don't fret.

543
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,879
Have some respect for this star.
Don't fret about the reward shit.

544
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,519
Once we wipe out those Sioux
the rest is easy.

545
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,239
You seem like a heavy-hitting hero.

546
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,559
-With help from Allah..
-What?

547
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,319
-I mean, yes, I am.
-Forget that.

548
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,839
The cowboy days are over.

549
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,159
Today you get young boys
sticking feathers in their heads...

550
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,319
...making whooping noises
and playing Indians all day.

551
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,479
That's kids for you.
What do they know about enemies?

552
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,999
Try talking sense to an Indian.
You'd never get anywhere.

553
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,079
Those freaks talk to
rivers, mountains and rocks.

554
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,319
-It must be the firewater.
-Just the firewater?

555
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,799
There's peace pipes, mushrooms,
and a pile of other shit.

556
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,519
But they're finished. Almost.

557
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,559
They have maybe half an acre
of land left around here.

558
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,719
I'll wipe out the lot of them
soon enough.

559
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,239
-Hey! Go play somewhere else!
-That's my second wife. Betty.

560
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,679
-Welcome, cowboy!
-My respects..

561
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,159
-Will you be staying a while?
-Well..

562
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,359
Mind your own business!

563
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,639
-Come to evening prayer if you like.
-We've had the evening call to prayer?

564
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,319
What?

565
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,399
Well, with a gammy leg..

566
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,359
Come on in.

567
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,319
It's not a church
to write home about.

568
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,119
But it's fine as a place
to perform religious duties.

569
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,399
Hey, don't take those boots off.
The assholes will nick them.

570
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,919
Divide religion and state, sheriff,
or the work will wear you out.

571
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,079
Public service. What can I do?
There's no choice.

572
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,919
-Come on! Aren't the floors done yet?
-But hasn't slavery been abolished?

573
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,199
You can't abolish slavery overnight
for God's sake!

574
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,079
Slowly but surely.
Get up, you!

575
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,359
If he sang a gospel song,
he'd have you in tears, you know.

576
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,559
Go on, get your robes on.
And make that voice soulful, huh!

577
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,959
Psst! Don't let him walk all over you.

578
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,799
-Here's our confession box.
-So the confessions come out, huh?

579
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,919
Well, they'll do..

580
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,999
What are you doing in there?
Get out, dickhead! Get out!

581
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,919
That's my oldest kid.. Eugene.

582
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,159
I should have shagged anything
but his mother.

583
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,439
Leave him alone, sheriff!
He's having a spiritual moment.

584
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,199
Spiritual, huh!? He's off his head
from that homebrew whisky.

585
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,479
-His friends call him Johnnie Walker.
-Johnnie Walker?

586
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,399
Aha.. Hey, say hello to the guy!

587
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,759
-Hello.
-Hello.

588
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,079
Don't get the wrong idea. This woman..
I was hearing her confession.

589
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,839
I'd just finished when you turned up.

590
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,439
-Welcome.. Got a smoke?
-No smokes, no.

591
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,839
-He should give me a smoke. No smokes..
-Ah! Here, a mirror!

592
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,359
When one crazy meets another
he's as mild as milk, they say.

593
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,399
Good for that mirror.
It'll keep him busy for hours.

594
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,199
Here's a picture of my mum.
You can keep it.

595
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,759
Where did you find that?
Get out of here! Quick march!

596
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,999
Get marching!

597
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,839
That's my boy!
Let's see the arms too!

598
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,079
Swing those arms too!

599
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,559
Sheriff, what's the story with you
and Johnny Lesh?

600
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,119
Johnny Lesh robbed
a mail coach last month.

601
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,799
He lifted a diamond
as big as your fist.

602
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,599
But the Sioux ambushed him
in a canyon and grabbed the diamond.

603
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,199
Now if you tell him
where those Sioux are...

604
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,599
...Johnny Lesh will do them in.

605
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,679
And we'll be rid of
the feathered jerks.

606
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,559
Don't fret over that reward.
Two grand is a drop in the ocean.

607
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,319
Give us a hand with this
and keep quiet about it.

608
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,359
-So the Sioux have the diamond?
-I swear by Allah.

609
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,559
-By AlIah?
-Well, just a slip of the tongue.

610
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,719
-Lemi!
-Excuse me!

611
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,959
The Sioux have the diamond. The Sioux!

612
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,279
The sheriff has a proposition for you.
He said to meet in the saloon tonight.

613
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,759
-Saloon?
-That's what he said.

614
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,079
Whoa!

615
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,199
Well, I'm after the diamond.
I haven't got a word out of her.

616
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,999
It's been a total waste of time.

617
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,599
Great.. Great. Good for you.

618
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,039
Speak! Speak! Where's the diamond?

619
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,359
Come on in. Welcome!

620
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,279
Now let's find somewhere to sit.

621
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,599
Get up from that table!
Fat ass!

622
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,799
You can't afford that table!

623
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,839
Murdoch of the Fidas
is sitting there. There you go.

624
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,599
Good luck.

625
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,679
Here, my dear friend.
Welcome!

626
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,559
Whisky over here!

627
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,279
Good luck.
I'll be right back.

628
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,039
Hey, didn't I tell you
no under-18s in this place?

629
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,599
Stetsoned fucker!

630
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,919
Chuck! Throw him out!

631
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,359
We don't want a fight yet.
There's still time for that.

632
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,919
Hey, Johnnie!
What are you doing here?

633
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,039
-Dad wants a Johnnie.
-Let's have it then.

634
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,439
Come on! Knock it back.
What's up? You're wasted?

635
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:10,479
Suzan, I drank like this as a kid.
It's also nice you're joining me.

636
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,599
But you're not watching
the cancan dancers.

637
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,439
They hired a belly dancer
for my circumcision party.

638
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,959
And I haven't been able
to look at one since.

639
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,839
Good evening to you!

640
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,799
-No Johnny Lesh?
-He'll be here in a while.

641
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,759
Busy pumping, is he?

642
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,999
I told him the story.
He's interested.

643
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,399
We'll set off tomorrow.
But we need all the Indian gear.

644
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,359
We'll arrange that.

645
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,919
Whoa!

646
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,439
Come on in, Casanova.
Have a seat.

647
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,479
-She was asking about the post office.
-Sure she was.

648
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,639
Don't fret.. Everything you want
will be taken care of.

649
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,359
Once we've taken out the Sioux chief
it'll be curtains for those shits here.

650
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,479
Besides, let the bastards learn
the price of screwing Johnny Lesh, huh?

651
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,679
We'll set out tomorrow at dawn,
Zozo the Kid too.

652
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,639
Three cheers!

653
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,959
I'm not thrilled by the idea of
messing with the Sioux, but anyway..

654
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,319
-Be honest. Were you pumping just now?
-Sheriff!

655
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,799
You just spoke like that
in front of a lady. Don't!

656
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,519
What's wrong? She has
more of a moustache than me.

657
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,559
Shh!

658
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,559
What's wrong, Suzan?

659
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:46,359
Suzan, that diamond's crucial for us.
Our lives depend on it.

660
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,759
We have to leave tomorrow morning.

661
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,999
Don't come if you don't want..
But it would really help if you did.

662
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,999
-They said I had a moustache. I heard!
-Look, I have one too. So what?

663
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,759
-They just don't see your beauty.
-Yeah, right. Sure.

664
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,399
There's an art to seeing beauty, Suzan.
Some people look and don't see it.

665
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,999
And it isn't where you look
that matters...

666
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,679
...it's what you see there.

667
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,119
See you tomorrow.

668
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,959
-Come inside, cowboy.
-I'm no cowboy, wench!

669
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,359
Move!

670
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,959
Go on, move!

671
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,839
Wow! Terrific story!

672
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,479
-So the Sioux got the diamond?
-Right.

673
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,439
Wow..

674
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,599
You know, I can't wait to see
how you bring the boots into it.

675
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,959
Well, the boots belong
to Johnny Lesh, don't they?

676
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,559
No. What's he got to do with them?

677
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,999
-Listen. These guys...
-Hey, Zeki. How about a break?

678
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,599
-I need a piss.
-Sure.

679
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,199
Me too, if you'll excuse me.

680
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,559
Hey! How's it going?

681
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,999
Terrific!

682
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,999
-Hand over that cappuccino.
-Wait. Let me fix this mouthpiece.

683
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,439
-Fuck!
-What's up?

684
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,799
I dropped it.. OK, 1 0-minute break
while I look for it.

685
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,279
-Yakari!
-Yakari?

686
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:02,879
Hamle ba Yakari! Haride Yakari!
Tannare Yakari!

687
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:07,279
Hanyere had Yakari! Kam le Yakari!
Koppe Yakari!

688
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,319
Aziz Efendi, I'm using my intuition..
Greetings, Iron Leg!

689
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,159
-Hello, Eagle Eye!
-Are you taking the piss?

690
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,759
-Well, Unwanted Hair of the Cherokees...
-The Cherokees?

691
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,479
The Grand Cherokees..
My friends Pajero and Pontiac.

692
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,359
We bring greetings to the chief.

693
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,639
Beat that! Let's see your cards.

694
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,719
Hello, chief!

695
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,719
This way. We'll sit over there.

696
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,399
Welcome.. I'm Red Rocks.
And this is my son, Bambi.

697
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,519
Thanks, chief. We're not hungry.

698
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:41,599
This is Barren Rocks, Crying Rocks,
Pink Rocks, and the other Rocks..

699
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,199
We're among rocks.

700
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,879
Yes.. The occasion of our visit
is a happy one.

701
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,239
We've come to obtain
the blessing of the tribal chief...

702
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,119
...for the marriage of our boy,
Unwanted Hair, and our girl, Pajero.

703
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,119
But Unwanted Hair is a girl's name.

704
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,239
-You see, my mum always wanted a girl.
-So she didn't have one?

705
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,639
Well, did she?

706
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,959
No, I guess not.

707
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,399
The Cherokees are our brothers.

708
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,759
It's a joy for us
that they marry and multiply.

709
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,479
Crying Rocks, light the incense!

710
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,959
Bring the gonads!

711
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,359
-What are gonads?
-Crystal bowls.

712
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,519
Step into the middle, bridegroom.

713
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:38,719
These buffalo balls will bring
blessings on your family.

714
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,599
Epiesa!

715
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,799
Sheda!.. Blow!

716
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,439
May they do their job!

717
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,999
We'll smoke a peace pipe tomorrow
at dawn and finish things off.

718
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,319
Now go back to your place.

719
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,319
Break up the gathering!

720
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,519
Aziz Efendi..

721
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,119
We'll get you officially married
back in town. Try a blow job then!

722
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,559
-Are you OK?
-Sure.

723
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,319
The chief was jerking me around.

724
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:34,399
If only you'd been here last week.
It was a local produce week.

725
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,959
Local produce?

726
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,279
Welcome once more!
Here you go.

727
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,239
Fuck the lot of you!

728
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:58,079
Speak, bridegroom, speak!
The balls have done their job.

729
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:08,159
This is nothing.
There are greater things to come..

730
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,239
Fuck off!

731
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,279
-Hey, it's me. Aziz!
-Oh right.

732
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,479
It hasn't done a lot to me.

733
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,719
I'm a local here, right?
So I should be treated like a local.

734
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,999
If they don't want my land,
they want something else.

735
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,759
They want our beads
and give us firewater.

736
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,759
The guy gave us fake firewater!

737
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,439
The boy lost his sight.
He's blind. Look!

738
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,159
They say he talks
to the trees and the river.

739
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,159
But the boy can't see
who he's talking to!

740
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,719
The other day, my boys...
The sheriff has that stooge.

741
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,279
-Right. Chuck.
-Aha.

742
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,759
They were pulling a tick off his head,
but the guy wouldn't stand stilI.

743
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,879
-Suddenly they'd scalped him by mistake.
-Ugh!

744
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:15,119
Then it's, " Indians are evil.
Watch their asses." What lies!

745
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:20,079
I want to say something. I like you.
You're a decent human being.

746
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,759
I mean.. The persecution
you're subjected to.. It's both..

747
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,239
Chief, do you have
any cookies or anything?

748
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,319
Come on, time for bed.

749
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,599
Aziz Efendi, my leg's gone.
My leg!

750
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,599
Man, what's the problem? I've got two.
You want to cross your legs?

751
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,679
No. But I have to stand up.

752
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,759
Stand up, man! Stand straight up..

753
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,079
Hey.. Where's Suzan?
Agh!

754
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,719
It's done nothing to me.
Nothing at all.

755
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,799
I'm just off to talk to the ants
over there. I'll be back. OK, bye!

756
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,639
-Get them to do some work!
-OK.

757
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,599
Watch out!.. A totem pole!

758
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,759
The totem pole's looking at us, Aziz!

759
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,999
I respect you as a folkloric thing
but I can't worship you, totem pole!

760
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,639
Totem pole... Je t'aime.

761
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,839
Man, don't smoke the stuff
if it doesn't do you any good.

762
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,679
What's the story, son?
You delivered the diamond?

763
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,439
No, we didn't.

764
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,999
Here.

765
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,719
You don't want it?

766
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,839
Crumple!

767
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,439
Hey!

768
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,159
Psst, Lemi!.. Lemi!

769
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,639
-Lemi!
-Huh?

770
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,599
Get up!.. Lemi!..
Don't forget why we're here!

771
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,519
-Psst, Lemi! Who am I?
-General Logar.

772
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,839
General Logar? Fuck him!
What's wrong with you, man?

773
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,599
Aziz, I feel dire.

774
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,079
Listen! I'm off to look for
the diamond. Stay right here.

775
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,279
OK.

776
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,039
Don't move!
Gambler!

777
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,879
Unwanted Hair!

778
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,799
No. Aziz Vefa, undercover agent.
For the secret services.

779
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,559
-But the secret's out now. Step out!
-Drop the gun!

780
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,119
-I'm Red Rocks.
-I know you are.

781
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,119
I'm here to get back
the sultan's diamond.

782
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,839
So you're a Turk..

783
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,759
They say the Turks are Indians.
Is that right?

784
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,879
No! Wrong way round.
They say the Indians are Turks.

785
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,759
Cut the crap
and hand over the diamond.

786
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,599
Whoa! You're saying
let's grab the diamond and go, huh?

787
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,439
That's not what I said.
I said, hand over the diamond.

788
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,439
-Pajero..
-No!.. Suzan Van Dyke!

789
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,279
You planned to nab the diamond
while everyone was asleep, right?

790
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,119
That's bullshit, Suzan!
Stop being paranoid.

791
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,199
-Don't move, anyone!
-Lemi!

792
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,519
-Pontiac!
-Alias Johnny Lesh!

793
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,519
-Make up your fucking minds!
-Johnny Lesh at the end of the day.

794
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,159
I'm Johnny Lesh.
I'm here to kill you.

795
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,919
Johnny Lesh! You, huh?
Mary Lou's killer!

796
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,639
Mary Lou? Don't even breathe
my mother's name! Did you tell him?

797
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,039
-No way!
-Unwanted Hai...

798
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,279
I'm Unwanted Hair!
Look at me when you speak!

799
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,159
-Unwanted Hair! My child!
-What hair? What child? What is this?

800
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,599
Get the diamond out!
Don't make me shoot!

801
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,759
Almighty Manitu! I've looked
everywhere for you, Johnny Lesh!

802
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,679
Did I have to meet my mortal enemy
when I'm so powerless?

803
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,439
-I have the girl. You handle the chief.
-Lemi, don't shoot Suzan.

804
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,879
Suzan! You know he's not Johnny Lesh!
We told you.

805
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,279
Ah! Don't, Aziz! Dad, stop!

806
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:21,519
-Why the hell did you shoot me?
-Everything got so confused.

807
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,519
-My child!
-Dad!

808
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,959
Well, child..

809
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,319
I met her in Greenville
as a young man.. She was dancing.

810
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,359
We fell in love.

811
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,479
She ran away with me.

812
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,599
The elders were furious.
They were against it. But I held out.

813
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,239
We were happy..
Then you were born.

814
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,879
One day, when I was out hunting,
Johnny Lesh descended on the village.

815
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,319
He killed Mary Lou right there.

816
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,039
They said you were cursed
and made me pay for it.

817
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,519
They wanted me to kill you,
to kill my baby!

818
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,559
I didn't have the heart.

819
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,759
I sent you down the Crying River.

820
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,959
Do you forgive me?
Do you forgive me, child?

821
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,559
Johnny Lesh got what he deserved.
We buried him, chief.

822
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,599
But I guess you have
the sultan's diamond.

823
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:52,199
You must give it back to us.
This is no Indian-white man war, chief!

824
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,919
You're not our enemies.
Especially if you're Suzan's dad..

825
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,679
Thanks, son.

826
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,439
But I have a weakness.

827
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:05,279
After losing my loved ones
I turned to gambling.

828
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,679
I was left with no land, nothing.

829
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:13,239
Every night in Cannonball I sank deeper
into ruin trying to win back my losses.

830
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,039
-Your diamond...
-Yes?

831
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,079
-I just gambled that away too.
-Agh!

832
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,839
-Where did it go?
-To Lloyd.

833
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,519
Sheriff Lloyd has the diamond.

834
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:32,639
Unlucky in love, lucky in gambling!

835
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:43,119
Idiot! Screw your stick-on beard!
Like I wouldn't realize!

836
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,679
Chuck! Let's hide this
somewhere safe right away.

837
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,039
Aziz!

838
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,639
-Where are you going?
-Back to Cannonball, Suzan.

839
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,239
-I'm coming too.
-Spend some time with your dad.

840
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,719
We'll come and say goodbye
as soon as we're done there.

841
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,079
Wait, guys! I lost the diamond,
so I'll get it back!

842
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,519
How, chief?
They want your head in town.

843
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,359
Just let them try!

844
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,159
Bravo.. Bravo, my boys!..
Bravo! You're looking good.

845
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,359
Chuck! Finish painting this one.
Do these two as well.

846
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,839
Stick that on your head.
That's it.

847
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,279
Nice!

848
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,439
Bravo.

849
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,879
Now listen carefully.

850
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,479
Do those war cries, whoop whoop,
and stir up a scene.

851
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,599
Make the foIks here think
they're being routed by Indians.

852
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,199
OK?

853
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,559
Have you got that?

854
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:08,359
Hey, just a second.
He's bringing the chief.

855
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,719
Huh? The guy still has
his head on his shoulders.

856
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,319
Scram! Get out of here!
Idiots!

857
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,559
Chuck! I'll high-whack you one!
Go get me a cola, damn it!

858
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:47,399
The Sioux chief Red Rocks!
Come along for a close-up look!

859
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,599
Suzan, we'll be right back.

860
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,199
Ah!

861
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,199
I know you! You married a white girl,
but then they killed her!

862
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:00,519
The little girl vanished. I remember!
She was from Greenville, right?

863
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,199
Baker! Come and take a photo of us.
Is that all right?

864
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,679
OK, I'm doing it!

865
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,039
Get one of me too!

866
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,759
Now from here! Me and the chief.
Another like this. And like this.

867
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:18,279
Now from the side! OK, enough!
Stop! Good thing I said something.

868
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:21,079
Anyone else for a photo?

869
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,639
Right, join the line!

870
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:30,039
Stick it in here.
Here you go.

871
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,239
What are you doing, man?

872
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,759
You shame yourself, Lesh!

873
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:45,159
I tell you to bring me his head
and you make the guy famous!

874
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,359
It's scandalous!
All those pictures he had taken!

875
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,799
Forget the cola now!

876
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,439
You said the chief had the diamond
but I'm told you have it.

877
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,559
I never said the chief had it!

878
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,159
Anyway, have you done the job
to be asking about the diamond?

879
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,879
Keep your nose out of this!
It's between me and Johnny Lesh.

880
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,559
Forget Johnny Lesh! We're Ottomans.
I'm Lemi Galip. And this is Aziz Vefa.

881
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,519
Ottomans, huh?

882
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,919
I should have known from the accent.
"Gala gulu, gala gulu.."

883
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,039
Let's have the diamond
or I'll riddle you with bullets!

884
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,999
This star didn't just
drop out of the sky, you know!

885
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,639
I'm the law here!

886
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,559
Want to shoot me
and grab the diamond, huh?

887
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,359
Go on! Shoot if you dare!

888
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,599
Tell us where the diamond is
or your man dies!

889
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,399
Fine, let him.
Good riddance for the town.

890
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,119
Crazy Turks coming to play cowboys..
You think I'd fall for that?

891
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,719
I'll hide that diamond so well
seven generations wouldn't find it.

892
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,959
-Go on, shoot!
-Hand it over.

893
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,279
-Go on.
-Hand it over.

894
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,519
-Go on.
-Aziz, cool it!

895
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,239
-Go on.
-Aziz, OK!

896
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,959
Aziz and Lemi...

897
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:02,719
I'Il get 'Wanteds' out for them both,
then the jerks will see what's coming!

898
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,919
Let's catch them ourselves, sheriff!
They're right here.

899
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,439
Chuck..

900
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,239
Get that hand down!

901
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,359
Run and get me a cola, fast!

902
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,839
Just let the nectar slip down..

903
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,399
Hands off!

904
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,119
That's great, thanks.

905
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,319
So the chief has
a few fans in town!

906
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,599
What's up?
What did the sheriff say?

907
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,359
We'll talk back in the hotel.
He won't say where it is.

908
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,679
Guys, it's a poker night.
Give me a chance.

909
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,519
I'll get the diamond off him.
Huh?

910
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:52,599
It says 'no feathers' on the door.
I guess you didn't see it.

911
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,719
I'm here to clean you out, Lloyd.
Underpants included! I've got cash.

912
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,079
Go on, sit down then,
if you can hold a hand of cards.

913
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,199
Get lost!

914
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:18,239
Fruit sodas for the spectators!
It's on me.

915
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,799
Cut the cards.

916
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,559
-I open with 1 00.
-Call.

917
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,879
Three cards.

918
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,959
And three for me.

919
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:51,359
Another 250.

920
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,759
500.

921
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,039
Two pair, queens.

922
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,439
You win!

923
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,119
You took lessons from the totem pole?

924
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,319
-Manitu's on your side.
-Another coffee!

925
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,999
Open a tab for the spectators!
Enough! How many coffees is that?

926
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,599
Full house queens.

927
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,399
Full house nines.

928
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,039
-We're going out for a bit.
-I'll be here.

929
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,279
Good man, chief!

930
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,879
It's going great.

931
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,279
-We're doing great, Aziz.
-Really?

932
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,119
-It's amazing! He's cleaning up.
-Ooh!

933
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,399
I want the diamond, Lloyd.

934
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,639
Wait.

935
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,599
-Aziz, throw me a tenner!
-What's up?

936
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,159
Everything's fine.
I'm raising the stakes.

937
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,199
Oh God, chief!

938
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,879
-Ah!
-Ah!

939
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,679
-What's up?
-Dad?

940
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,919
-Chief?
-Everything's fine.

941
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,959
-Chief, what happened?
-Dad?

942
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,079
'And while Isadora,
brushed by the sweet breeze...

943
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,319
'...tried to hide
her blushing cheeks...'

944
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,399
'...Jack grabbed her by the waist
and pulled her to him.'

945
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,119
'Their bodies merged, drawing
their lips irresistibly together.'

946
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:21,279
'Jack was no longer just a cowboy.
He was a man too.'

947
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,879
Oh my God!
Show me a cowboy like that!

948
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,399
-Watch it! There's a man around!
-Whoa.. Aziz!

949
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,639
-Are you reading a novel, Suzan?
-Huh?.. I'm cleaning my gun.

950
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,759
How clean can a gun ever be?

951
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,319
Hey, you became a real cowboy
with the banjo and stuff.

952
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,199
Get out of here!
It's just boredom, that's all.

953
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:51,959
But it's not much good for our music.
That's because the system's different.

954
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:55,759
-Our notes are kind of screwed up.
-Screwed up? Hmm..

955
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,359
-You mean like me..
-Don't say that!

956
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:03,079
The musical system's different.
You go Do-Re-Mi; we have commas.

957
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,959
Hah. You guys always say to watch out
for Mi. Is that because of the commas?

958
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,679
Right. Like this, for example.
Do.. Re..

959
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:15,359
Dooo.. Reee.. Miii...
Miii.. Faa.. Mi..

960
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:19,559
-That's Mi?.. That was all Mi?
-Exactly. Because of the commas.

961
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,919
I see. That's great..
Hey, play something, won't you?

962
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,679
-Shall I?
-Go on.

963
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,199
OK, here goes..

964
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:30,199
Down to the railroad..
Ain't mamma let me go again..

965
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,199
Down to the..

966
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,639
Now something more our style..

967
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:47,239
I lament to no one..

968
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:54,319
I weep at my plight..

969
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:10,639
I shake like a criminal
as I contemplate my future..

970
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:18,119
Wow!.. What weird lyrics, huh?

971
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,879
Yes, well they kind of lose meaning
translated into English.

972
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,399
But it's like they describe me.
'I weep at my plight'.. Ha-ha..

973
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:30,479
-Why would you cry, Suzan?
-Why wouldn't I, Aziz?

974
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,639
I'm 22 and I've only just found out
my mum was a cancan girl...

975
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,279
...and my dad's an Indian.

976
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,279
My dad was a street porter.
But mum had to carry the full load.

977
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,559
So?

978
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,919
Well, people used to tease me.

979
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,199
But in the end, he's a dad.
You have to love him as he is.

980
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:51,479
-He's a bit of a gambler.
-I'm talking about being Indian!

981
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,679
But so what if he's Indian or white?

982
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:58,359
Sooner or later everyone will realize
the whole world is brothers.

983
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:02,519
-Oh yeah? The whole world brothers?
-Except us two. Here..

984
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:09,279
Sure, you get odd incidents
where people go for each other..

985
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:13,279
But you can't talk about world war.
Has there been a world war up to now?

986
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,359
We're in the 1 9th century.
Has there ever been a world war?

987
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,039
No. But that doesn't mean
there never will be either.

988
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,679
Look, one or two is OK, Suzan.

989
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,719
Hold this.

990
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:29,319
It isn't just the notes.
I guess you're 'comma-tose' too.

991
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,359
Of course I am..

992
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,119
I'm crazy about you!

993
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,119
Crazy about me?

994
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:42,959
But do you really think
we're such a good match? Huh?

995
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,759
I mean..
It's like we're worlds apart.

996
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,359
For one thing, I chew tobacco.
And you guys have banned tobacco.

997
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:53,119
Damn it! That was Murat IV!
The 1 7th century!

998
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,959
Drop your preconceptions, will you!

999
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,879
If it's not camels, it's this ban
or that ban. That's all bullshit!

1000
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:02,039
And there's the four wives thing.
What will you do?

1001
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,199
Take another three
and lock me up in the house?

1002
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,639
They always go on about that.
Four wives..

1003
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,279
We have a character called
Hürmüz of the Seven Husbands.

1004
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,759
No one mentions her.

1005
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,119
You're from the east for a start.

1006
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:16,199
But that's exactly
why you're right for me!

1007
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,999
Horse, woman, gun!
You have it all!

1008
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,399
No. No, I know that story.

1009
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:26,559
So what'll happen
when you take me back?

1010
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:29,839
Your elders won't want me.
There'll be a big fuss.

1011
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,279
I've already been dumped
in the Crying River.

1012
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:35,359
What are you going to do?
Dump me in the Golden Horn?

1013
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,439
If any guy did that to you,
I'd sink them in the Golden Horn!

1014
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,639
Not even the Japanese would
haul him up 100 years from now.

1015
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,479
Forget this east-west war.
The east has its good sides too.

1016
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,759
-Like what?
-Like me.

1017
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,239
-Your moustache is intriguing..
-So is yours, baby.

1018
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,279
Another all-nighter..
There we go.

1019
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,999
I've been pIaying years
and he thinks he can wallop me! Jerk!

1020
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,199
Hand these out to the poor.

1021
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,879
Give the feathers to the women
for stuffing pillows and whatnot.

1022
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,359
It makes me crazy
knowing he has the diamond...

1023
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,199
...and not being able to get it.

1024
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,919
Bonjour!

1025
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,079
Morning, Aziz.

1026
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,319
I'd blow his brains out,
but where would that get us?

1027
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,799
Just great! The chief blew
all the money at poker last night.

1028
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:44,959
I dropped by the tribe
and got some stuff to wear.

1029
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:48,399
I guess these are yours.
The boys gave me them.

1030
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,839
Sorry about that.

1031
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,879
What's up?
What's with the long faces?

1032
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,319
Huh? What's up?

1033
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,799
Maybe I can get something
out of the sheriff.

1034
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,879
-Using my feminine charm...
-No! I won't allow it!

1035
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:14,199
-What feminine charm, Suzan?
-What's wrong with her feminine charm?

1036
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:19,359
Everyone in town must work on it.
Even the slightest clues may help.

1037
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,719
Let's find out
where he's hidden that diamond.

1038
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,079
-My Indian instincts tell me...
-Spare us, chief!

1039
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,279
We saw those instincts last night.

1040
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,479
-You're right, son.
-Son?

1041
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,319
Instincts..

1042
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,599
Come on, guys! Let's go.

1043
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,839
-How's things, Betty?
-Come round, come round!

1044
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,479
Did you make that?

1045
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,919
Greetings to your mum.

1046
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,679
Off you go now.

1047
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,199
Father, I want to confess.

1048
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,919
Man, haven't you
drowned in sin by now?

1049
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,719
So be it.. Get in there.

1050
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:27,359
Why don't you stand up?
Then I'll hear you better.

1051
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,479
I'm standing already.

1052
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,319
Forgive me..
What's your name?

1053
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:36,999
Alejandro Gomez Arias Jose
Lobredo Alfonzo Villa de Sandoz.

1054
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:42,119
Damn your name! Keep it short.
Come on, the metre's running!

1055
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:46,799
-I stole Juan Jimenez Garcia's horses.
-Keep going, son.

1056
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,399
And I've killed
the child inside me, father!

1057
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,159
Agh!

1058
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,199
Abortion..
The greatest sin of all!

1059
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,119
-Will the good Lord forgive me?
-Be strong and He will.

1060
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,159
Now step outside.

1061
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,759
God is always great.
He's sure to forgive you.

1062
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,239
Hands up!..
I arrest you in the name of the law!

1063
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:15,519
Came to confess, did you? Asshole!
That's one thing. This is another.

1064
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:18,199
-Get moving!
-Give me another chance, sheriff!

1065
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,599
To hell with your chances!

1066
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:25,639
Sheriff, could we
settle it like this?

1067
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,799
What the hell was that?

1068
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:33,159
-Ah! Let me see your earrings!
-Huh.. Sure, go ahead.

1069
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,519
You never wear jewellery, Betty.
How come?

1070
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:39,599
Right. I'm the sheriff's wife
but I have nothing to show for it.

1071
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,559
That's crazy! The sheriff loves you.
It's obvious.

1072
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,879
He got you a diamond necklace, huh?
It's the talk of the town.

1073
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:49,399
Not for me. He's going to sell it.
He wouldn't even let me try it on.

1074
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:52,359
Of course he didn't.
He's giving it to me.

1075
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:55,759
He said so himself.
He said he'd give it to me.

1076
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,439
Well, fine..

1077
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,599
Your dad has a diamond at home.
Has he ever mentioned it?

1078
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,919
What diamond?
Mind your own business!

1079
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:07,759
Anyway, dad said you'd be
under American rule in 20 years.

1080
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,999
He was talking about your mum
when he said "American rule" !

1081
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,079
-Get going!
-Let's go, guys!

1082
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,399
We loved it!

1083
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,599
Fucking Chucky..

1084
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,519
Almighty God..

1085
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,119
These are the sins
I've committed today.

1086
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,879
Taking a bribe for the Jessys' land..

1087
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:30,319
Groping the neighbour's girl,
Mary Lane..

1088
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,319
Taking a 20-buck backhander
just now..

1089
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:36,279
That's all I can think of for now.

1090
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,959
-What's up? How did it go?
-So-so.

1091
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,199
I found out a few things.
I had pie and stuff. You?

1092
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,799
They said I'd get something
out of the kids, but nothing.

1093
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,399
I have another source anyway.
Let's see.

1094
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,239
-Do one for me, will you?
-Really?

1095
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,559
-Aziz! I'm going back to the hotel!
-Agh!

1096
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:59,719
-Ah! It's stuck. It's stuck.
-Wait.

1097
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,199
-Careful though.
-Wait.

1098
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,759
But wait.

1099
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:03,919
Pull..

1100
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,959
Agh!.. Ah!

1101
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,839
Your moustache has gone too.

1102
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,359
-Oh my gosh.. So how's it look?
-Good.

1103
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:19,199
-The earrings look great on you.
-You think so?

1104
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,039
But I didn't get to try any of that.

1105
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,519
Well, we should be grateful
for hairless mercies.

1106
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:31,239
OK, then I'll..
I'll go back to the hotel.

1107
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:34,519
-I should get cleaned up.
-Off you go then.

1108
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,919
His wife doesn't know a lot.

1109
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:43,199
But he plans to sell the diamond,
or so he said. That's a risk of course.

1110
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:44,759
-Lemi?
-Huh?

1111
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,759
He muttered something in the church.

1112
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:50,639
I tried getting a gramophone recording
but the quality's terrible. Listen..

1113
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:59,359
"The idiot stole milk and two goats
he'd been herding on the mountain.."

1114
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,319
-Nah.
-No.

1115
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:04,919
" Let it be my duty to shut them up.."

1116
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:06,279
No.

1117
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:10,039
"Soon as I've sold that diamond
I'm out of here."

1118
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,079
"The fuckers will never find me."

1119
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,239
-Ah!
-Yes!

1120
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,239
That's it!

1121
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,399
I got a photo of him on the sly,
but it'll only be ready in 1 0 days.

1122
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:18,999
On the sly?

1123
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,799
What the hell was that?

1124
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:21,759
Aha.

1125
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,919
-Didn't you have some other source?
-Right.

1126
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,399
-I know where the diamond is.
-How do you know?

1127
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,239
I got it out of Chuck.

1128
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,519
-Chuck, where's the diamond?
-In the safe.

1129
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:36,759
-So how do we get it from the safe?
-We don't. He'll give it to us himself.

1130
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,399
Here's the scheme I've dreamed up.

1131
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,799
The Forty Rivers
Oil Wrestling Championship.

1132
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,559
-Oil wrestling..
-Aha.

1133
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:47,319
We did it once too, but stopped
when the oil ran out.

1134
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:48,319
Huh?

1135
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,959
What's 1 8 June?
The liberation of Cannonball!

1136
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,079
Who's the bastard scared of?
The district governor.

1137
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,039
Lemi, wire the governor right away.

1138
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:03,399
'The Ottoman Sultan has declared
Cannonball a twin town of Tophane.'

1139
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:06,559
'A wrestling contest
will be held on liberation day...'

1140
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:10,119
'...with the prize of a diamond necklace.
Your presence will be an honour, etc.'

1141
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:13,079
Once it's signed Sheriff Lloyd
we're all set.

1142
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,719
Aziz, you're a genius.
Bravo! It's brilliant.

1143
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,559
You think it'll work?

1144
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:22,039
-Fate will decide.
-And the wrestling gear?

1145
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,079
We'll fix that.

1146
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,959
They're still hanging around.

1147
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:30,719
They're up to something for sure.
But we'll figure it out.

1148
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:35,039
Chuck! Get me that list
of deadly gangsters!

1149
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:40,079
I need to find a wacko
to even the score with them.

1150
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:47,479
No, wrong one! Get me the one
with mother and father killers!

1151
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,279
Jesse James.. No, no good.

1152
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:59,559
Billy the Kid..
Still wet round the ears.

1153
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:04,279
Hoss from 'Bonanza'..
Who put this angel face in here?!

1154
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,879
Take him out
before the boy gets in trouble.

1155
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:12,879
-That's the one.. Buck Berry!
-Sorry, sheriff?

1156
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:14,599
Chuck!

1157
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:16,999
Keep still, damn it!

1158
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,679
Buck Berry of Brokeback..

1159
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,879
Only you can handle this, Buck Berry!

1160
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:27,319
No hick shows up here and takes
the law into his own hands! Right?

1161
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,719
And there's that baldhead, right?

1162
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:35,519
Just wipe the floor with him
so I'm proud to be a Cannonballer!

1163
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,119
-Selam aleykum!
-Aleyk...

1164
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:42,239
I hear you're holding
a wrestling contest, sheriff.

1165
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:46,679
-I've come to sign up for it.
-Forget the wrestling and sit down.

1166
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:51,319
Buck Berry of Brokeback..
Buck Berry has a complaint against you.

1167
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,359
I'm a man of the law.
It's not for me to get involved.

1168
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,999
Buck Berry is challenging you
to a duel.

1169
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,399
I accept his challenge.

1170
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:03,079
I gather you're Ottoman, Aziz Bey?

1171
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:05,719
Yes, from Istanbul.

1172
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:09,359
I've heard all about Istanbul's baths.
Turkish hamams!

1173
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,359
Yes. I'm actually from Samatya,
but I have friends in Galata.

1174
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,839
-If you're passing...
-Ah! But I can't get away!

1175
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,639
Always on horseback.. But a visit
to the hamam, the heat, the lather..

1176
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,679
But you sweat in a hamam.

1177
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,439
-Ha-ha-ha! I know what you mean.
-Well, I don't!

1178
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,159
What's going on?
What happened to the duel?

1179
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:34,239
Such a fine gentleman can't be shot!
A drink in the saloon, Aziz Bey?

1180
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,959
You go ahead. I'll join you later.
I have respect for everyone.

1181
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:40,239
Sheriff, put me down.
Goodbye, God speed.

1182
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:43,119
See you again.
You can buy me a drink one day.

1183
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,399
-With pleasure..
-Ah! I do hope so.

1184
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,799
What the hell are you doing?

1185
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,159
I say kill the guy and you're all set
to get yourself killed! Pansy!

1186
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:56,599
I'll ram you right here, sheriff!
Stop getting on my nerves!

1187
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,439
Aziz Efendi..

1188
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:06,559
Aziz Efendi, you need breaking in.
Let's practice and get you in shape.

1189
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,479
Wait, don't oil me. Stop!
You'll land me in trouble.

1190
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:12,759
-Rub some on my back.
-Wait! You don't know the story. Move!

1191
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,039
-Who's that?
-Get moving!

1192
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,759
Bald or blind, only you
can help yourself, as they say.

1193
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,239
Look this way.

1194
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,599
Look this way, damn it!

1195
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:31,599
Go say the sheriff challenges him
to a duel after evening prayer.

1196
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:34,599
And you go to the bell tower
as always.

1197
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,999
OK, a little action now.
Let's see you vamp it up.

1198
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,239
Don't be jealous looking at us..

1199
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,279
Find your match
and be happy in marriage..

1200
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:50,519
-Ha-pp-yy..
-Happy in marriage..

1201
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,999
-Don't be...
-Suzan.. Suzan!

1202
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:56,159
-I found this at home. And an umbrella.
-Thanks, Betty.

1203
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,599
It'll be the first time
I wear anything like this.

1204
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:01,679
Take a look.
What do you think?

1205
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:05,359
-Come over here.
-Aziz!

1206
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,799
I hope you're not wasting your time.
There's no answer to the telegram yet.

1207
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,879
It'll come, baby.
Hopefully..

1208
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,879
-What happened to that horse stunt guy?
-We're waiting for an answer.

1209
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:17,359
Aziz, our poetry reader's here.
Go on, sweetie.

1210
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:22,319
An Apache weeps..
There are tears in his eyes..

1211
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,399
-He was a lonesome..
-Aziz Bey!

1212
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,519
What do you want?

1213
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:29,639
Sheriff Lloyd challenges you
to a duel on the square. At 6.00.

1214
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,439
-Aziz.. Let me go instead.
-I'll face the sheriff!

1215
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,359
-Suzan, you can't risk your life!
-Aziz, this is my game.

1216
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,959
It's child's play for me.
You can't pull a gun faster than me.

1217
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,839
-I'm fast too! Look!
-Hey! That's my gun.

1218
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,039
Huh.

1219
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,719
Go on, pulI that gun.
Let's see how fast you are.

1220
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,959
Suzan, how can I pull a gun on you?

1221
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:52,639
If you're faster than me,
you can go to the duel. Now go on!

1222
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,599
-Suzan..
-Go on!

1223
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:54,519
-Chief..
-Go on!

1224
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,519
-Chuck!
-Lemi!

1225
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,519
-Go on!
-Make up your fucking minds!

1226
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:07,319
Tell the sheriff
he'll be taking on Suzan Van Dyke.

1227
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:10,679
Let me check up on
that crazy man of mine.

1228
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:13,119
-Child..
-Dad..

1229
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,719
Aziz..

1230
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,039
Look here! If you put this
in your memoirs, I'll kill you!

1231
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:33,639
This is the calm before the storm.
There are greater things to come..

1232
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,399
Get out of here!

1233
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,839
Hey, what's that vulture doing?

1234
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:49,879
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Measuring the lady.. For the coffin.

1235
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:53,799
If you need measurements,
I'll do it. Here.. 25 cm. Beat it!

1236
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,319
Suzan, I'm going to
give you my mum's talisman.

1237
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,399
It'll protect you from all danger.

1238
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,799
Maybe not. OK.
I love you, Suzan.

1239
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:08,199
-I love you too, Aziz.
-Hey, come on, baldhead!

1240
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:12,079
Clear off or you'll get
a knife in your ass.

1241
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,919
-Clear off too, you lot.
-Good luck!

1242
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:23,879
When the duel's done
just get the fuck out of town!

1243
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,279
There!.. On the roof!

1244
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,639
Agh!

1245
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,039
That was so predictable
coming from you.

1246
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:56,839
Son of a bitch!

1247
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,799
-Suzan..
-Aziz!

1248
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:05,799
-Aziz, here's your mirror back.
-Good job, Johnnie!

1249
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,759
Actions speak louder than words.

1250
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:10,799
A man's rank of mind is mirrored
in his deeds.. Nice work, Johnnie!

1251
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:15,919
This sorry mind is unequal to such wit
for the balance cannot bear the weight.

1252
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,839
Ziya Pasha..

1253
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:22,799
That's my man!

1254
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:28,399
Sheriff Lloyd?
There's a telegram for you.

1255
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:30,199
Get away!

1256
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,839
The governor's office, it says..

1257
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:42,799
An invitation, huh?..
Kırkpınar oil wrestling..

1258
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:49,839
Under the patronage of
the great Ottoman sultan, huh?

1259
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:52,239
And it says I organized it!

1260
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:56,279
Whoever sent the telegram
can rot in hell!

1261
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:01,239
Governor Wilson is coming.
The mayor will show up.

1262
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:04,479
There'll be people from
the district governor's office.

1263
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:07,359
How can I give away that huge diamond
with my own hands?

1264
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,759
-God! Just be rid of it!
-Fuck you and your vinegar water!

1265
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:16,199
-Hey! Go play outside! This minute!
-Go on, hit him! Hit the boy!

1266
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:19,759
Hit him on the head
so he's crazy like his brother.

1267
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,959
What am I going to do?

1268
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:25,639
I'm losing it.
They'll all be here tomorrow.

1269
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,719
I'll kill myself.. I'll kill myself!

1270
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:33,719
It's not so easy, miss.
The thing's like a chandelier crystal.

1271
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,559
-Hey, what did you say?
-Chandelier crystal!

1272
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:43,799
-Nice one, Chuck!.. High five!
-Please, sheriff!

1273
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,679
I mean it for real this time.

1274
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,479
Agh!

1275
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,479
Fuck your dad's enemies!

1276
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:57,879
A chandelier crystal, right?
Ha ha ha!

1277
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,639
Your local costumes are great too.

1278
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:18,319
-You could be a bridegroom!
-Thanks, chief.

1279
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:22,239
-How do I look, dad?
-As beautiful as your mum, sweetie.

1280
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:25,119
OK, I'm going in there.

1281
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,839
-OK, good luck.
-Thanks, baby.

1282
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,199
-Lemi!
-Aziz?

1283
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:31,439
-Guess who's here?
-Who?

1284
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,199
Buffalo Bill!
You're doing the opening speech.

1285
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,999
So this is the real McCoy..

1286
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,239
Then it's the horseback cowboy.
I gave him money..

1287
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,879
-And here I am, honey..
-Nice! Off to your horse!

1288
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,759
The governor's here.
The governor!

1289
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,159
The governor!

1290
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:51,079
Lemi Galip, sir.
From the Treasury.. Welcome!

1291
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,199
Aziz Vefa from intelligence.
But that's a secret.

1292
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,799
-Good to meet you.
-Welcome.

1293
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,479
Mr Governor. William Lloyd,
sheriff of Cannonball.

1294
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:00,599
-Good to meet you.
-And I'm his wife, Betty Lloyd.

1295
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:03,319
-A pleasure, lady.
-It's all clean. Please have a seat.

1296
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:08,639
Please.. Go ahead..
I've organized everything!

1297
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:11,919
Get up from there!
You're sitting somewhere else.

1298
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,639
Get out of here!

1299
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:20,319
Mr Governor, we've been buddies
with our Indian brothers for years.

1300
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,919
I'd also like to give you the prize
we'll be presenting to the winner.

1301
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:26,519
Thanks.

1302
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:30,079
-Sir, we're starting.
-Go ahead.

1303
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:39,559
One, two, testing..
One, two, testing.. Testing..

1304
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,959
Aziz..

1305
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,479
Ya yay..

1306
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:51,639
Mr Governor.. Mr District Governor..
Mr Mayor..

1307
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:57,199
Our Indian brothers and sisters..
And people of Cannonball..

1308
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,919
I'm looking around to see
if I've forgotten anyone.

1309
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:09,319
Since our sultan has declared
the Istanbul district of Tophane..

1310
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:13,319
...to be a twin town of
this distinguished community...

1311
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:16,039
...I am delighted now
to present a pageant...

1312
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:20,199
...of the liberation of Cannonball
from enemy forces by the home guard.

1313
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:42,919
An Apache weeps..
There are tears in his eyes..

1314
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:47,879
He was a lonesome cowboy..
He rode over mountains..

1315
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:52,319
Weep, cowboy, weep!
Let me weep too!

1316
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:57,319
Let me give you
a patch of these lands!

1317
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:03,239
Get up and do something too. Go on!
We need to get in with the governor.

1318
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:11,279
American cowboys ride around
with no underpants, bareback..

1319
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:18,879
And now for Suzan Van Dyke's
shooting show!

1320
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:24,399
Get out there! Quick!
Mind you don't shoot the governor.

1321
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,119
Five minutes to go, guys.

1322
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:56,799
Wrestler!.. Wrestler!
The gallant are out there!

1323
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,799
Every one as manly as the next..

1324
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:03,919
Kick like horses..
Fight like lions..

1325
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:07,839
Here you have the arena..
And here the wrestlers.

1326
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:13,319
Don't waver if you're underneath..
Don't swagger if you're on top..

1327
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,319
Grab his crotch if you're underneath..

1328
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:19,799
Get a hand in his pants
if you're on top..

1329
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:22,039
The winner is.. Aziz Vefa!

1330
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:24,999
Nice one, Aziz!

1331
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:29,479
-What does the winner get?
-His head.. What's it to you?

1332
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:30,999
Watch the show!

1333
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:38,359
The winner is.. Little Joe!

1334
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,639
The winner is.. Aziz Vefa!

1335
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:54,519
The winner is.. Dumb John!

1336
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:00,679
-Go for it, Aziz!.. Bravo!
-The winner is.. Aziz Vefa!

1337
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:05,879
The winner is.. Big Ben!

1338
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,079
Nice work, Aziz!

1339
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:15,039
Are you really thrashing them
or are they just being nice?

1340
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:16,559
They're being nice.

1341
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:19,799
-We've got the diamond, Aziz. Huh?
-Right.

1342
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:22,279
-There's just a small detail left.
-What, him?

1343
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:24,359
No, not him. That guy.

1344
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:27,439
What do you want?
He's oily enough. Go away!

1345
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,159
Go on, Aziz! You're doing great.
Good luck!

1346
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,719
Bravo, Aziz! Bravo!

1347
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,039
-Is he dead?
-No.

1348
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,319
I fed him two bowls of beans
before the contest.

1349
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:50,919
He did well to last that long.

1350
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:54,639
The winner of the contest.. Aziz Vefa!

1351
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:58,959
Come on, Aziz.
The governor's waiting.

1352
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,559
I'm so happy, 0Suzan.

1353
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,119
Well done, baldhead.
Congratulations.

1354
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:10,119
You won with your own hands.

1355
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:13,639
Mr Governor, please,
you do the honours. Here you are.

1356
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,079
-Congratulations, Aziz Bey.
-Thanks, sir.

1357
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:21,599
How do you say? You've won
a great victory in this arena.

1358
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,559
So I present you with this prize.
Here you are.

1359
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,679
-Aziz Bey?
-Have a seat.

1360
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,999
-Aziz, the diamond's a fake.
-I can tell.

1361
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:40,679
-The real diamond's in the safe.
-I think I know where the key is.

1362
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,039
How come?

1363
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:45,039
-I got it out of Chuck.
-You got it out of Chuck?

1364
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:49,319
-Chuck! Where's the diamond?
-In the safe.

1365
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,879
-Where's the key?
-Up the sheriff's ass.

1366
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:53,319
Fuck you!

1367
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:58,799
I didn't take him seriously at first.
But it all falls into place now.

1368
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:01,759
Wait here.

1369
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,599
-Mr Governor?
-Yes?

1370
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:07,879
If I may, I'd like to challenge
Sheriff Lloyd to a show fight.

1371
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:10,119
Of course, as you wish.

1372
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,359
-Get going, crook!
-But Mr Governor...

1373
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:13,999
-Bring the gear!
-But Mr Governor..

1374
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:15,639
Roll the drums!

1375
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,319
Lloyd!

1376
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:37,279
Hey, I may have a gammy leg,
but you've asked for it, baldhead.

1377
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:40,839
Come on then..
Third world citizen!

1378
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:45,239
There's only one world in my book.
And you have no place in it, Lloyd!

1379
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:50,279
-I'll go to the moon then.
-You'd say you did, even if you hadn't.

1380
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,919
Shut up!
Shitty assed imperialist!

1381
01:44:56,200 --> 01:45:00,839
You'll get your asses kicked out
of the Balkans in the next 50 years!

1382
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:03,479
-Then you'll have your ass in a sling!
-No chance!

1383
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:05,799
-Ah!
-Ah!

1384
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:10,719
Hey! Get out of there!
That's my goddamn boner!

1385
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,039
Suzan!

1386
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:21,119
The winner is.. Aziz Vefa!

1387
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:26,239
Feeling better now?

1388
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,999
Chief.. He's all yours!

1389
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,839
And now, the wedding duet!

1390
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:00,439
I'm so sick of singlehood..

1391
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:03,919
I get no thrill from mistresses..

1392
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:07,879
I'm so sick of singlehood..

1393
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:11,399
I get no thrill from mistresses..

1394
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:15,239
All I want now is to marry..

1395
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:18,559
But where to find a suitable girl?

1396
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:22,679
All I want now is to marry..

1397
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:26,279
But where to find a suitable girl?

1398
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:29,999
I'm so sick of singlehood..

1399
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:33,359
I get no thrill from lovers..

1400
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:37,279
All I want now is to marry..

1401
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:39,519
But where to find a suitable man?

1402
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:41,759
-What was your name, young fellow?
-Chuck.

1403
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:43,279
You've got it coming!

1404
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:48,479
But where to find a suitable man?

1405
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:52,279
Here's a girl, a tiny thing..

1406
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:55,639
Will she love me, if I ask?

1407
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:59,759
Here's a girl, a tiny thing..

1408
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,079
Will she love me, if I ask?

1409
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:06,879
Mademoiselle,
will you give me your hand?

1410
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:10,399
Take my hand
now you've won my heart..

1411
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:14,439
Mademoiselle,
will you give me your hand?

1412
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:17,879
Take my hand
now you've won my heart..

1413
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:21,919
Now I've found my love at last..

1414
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:25,159
You're my blessing from heaven..

1415
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:29,319
Open your arms,
fall into my embrace..

1416
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:32,719
May your turn come next
if you're singIe..

1417
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:36,719
Don't be jealous looking at us..

1418
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:39,919
Find your match
and be happy in marriage..

1419
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,919
Don't be jealous looking at us..

1420
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:47,439
Find your match
and be happy in marriage..

1421
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,239
Tell him about the woman.
She almost had him in the coach!

1422
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:05,959
Aziz Efendi, enough of the jokes.
There was this woman.

1423
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:07,399
Hmmm..

1424
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:12,639
Hey! The kid from the church!
You made it to the White House, huh?

1425
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,639
-Nice work!
-This is nothing yet.

1426
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,559
I'm just pissing
in their lemonade for now.

1427
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:18,279
Just wait for the rest..

1428
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:20,599
Well, thanks for that!

1429
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,639
Ah! What are you doing here?

1430
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:26,959
Didn't I tell you
greater things were to come?

1431
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:29,319
Cheers.

1432
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:32,199
The president,
James Abraham Garfield..

1433
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:45,999
Lemi..

1434
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:50,239
Late as it is, I'd like to present
the gift of our sultan..

1435
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:54,479
-Here you are.
-As a token of our friendship..

1436
01:48:56,640 --> 01:49:02,519
Whoa! Incredible!
Where did you find this, huh?

1437
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:05,199
You didn't steal it, did you?

1438
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:11,399
-Do you have things like this?
-It's a gift from the sultan's heart.

1439
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:16,959
Fine, but I can't wear this.
Isn't that right, Benson?

1440
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:25,359
Now, I have a question for you.
Are there camels where you come from?

1441
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:30,239
-Yes, there are. But not your size.
-Fine then.

1442
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:35,239
Aziz Bey, a small gift for you
from the White House.

1443
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:39,719
Considering you're bound to get
your babooshes stolen on the way...

1444
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:42,039
...at least you won't return barefoot!

1445
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:48,279
Aziz, don't lose your rag.

1446
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:52,199
Mr President,
let me give you an answer.

1447
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:55,399
Bare of foot and bald of head
we toured the western realm..

1448
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:58,879
Some was mild, some was wild,
some was fine of pen..

1449
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:02,479
You merit the name 'jackass'
but let's keep it at 'jack'..

1450
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:05,319
Hand over your shit boots,
at least they're a gift back..

1451
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:07,079
High-five, Lemi!

1452
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:11,759
So that's the story Vedat.
In fact...

1453
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:16,639
...you'll find Aziz's coup de grace
to the president...

1454
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:20,679
...written here in old Turkish.
I mean, the whole thing is...

1455
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:24,039
-For real.
-For real, exactly.

1456
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:26,079
Here, let's have a look.

1457
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,559
-Here. The old Turkish.
-Wow.. Extraordinary.

1458
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:32,599
Terrific.

1459
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:36,999
Hey, Zeki, you tell a great story.
You had us on the edge of our seats.

1460
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:40,199
So what do you want for the boots?

1461
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,119
Twenty.

1462
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:45,319
-Twenty what?
-Afyon dinars!

1463
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:51,599
20,000 bucks. But believe me,
that's just for you.

1464
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:54,039
Alpay knows this.

1465
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:57,959
Vedat, if I didn't need the money
I seriously wouldn't be selling them.

1466
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:59,679
They're worth a fortune.

1467
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:04,039
Well, Zeki..
I mean, if it was the diamond..

1468
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:08,759
All that stuff's in the museums.
So I don't get to see it either.

1469
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:14,639
Just kidding. But to be honest
I'm not that interested in the boots.

1470
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,439
-You should find a collector.
-Right.

1471
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:20,319
-So you're not interested.
-I'm afraid not.

1472
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:23,279
-Alpay, OK with you?
-Sure.

1473
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:29,199
Vedat, there's something else
I thought might grab your interest.

1474
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:33,679
Now this is an emerald encrusted...

1475
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,239
-...a solid emerald nunchaku.
-Whoa!

1476
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,959
-You brought the mimchika?
-Nunchaku, not mimchika.

1477
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:46,479
Did you mean 'mimchika'?
This nunchaku is solid emerald.

1478
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:51,159
It was a gift of the sultan
to the emperor of China.

1479
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:54,679
And what they've done is,
these emeralds...

1480
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:59,199
-Yes?
-I'll only go on if you're a buyer.

1481
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:01,999
Well, go on then.

1482
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:04,999
The sultan summons
Aziz and Lemi before him...

1483
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:31,679
Whatever the hell they put in this,
it gives a wicked buzz.

1484
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,599
-A pat on the ass to the makers!
-Enjoy!

1485
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,839
-You want the formula?
-Go on.

1486
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,319
Here!

1487
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:44,079
No, not that.
Have you never seen Istanbul?

1488
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:47,759
No, but some friends went to Bodrum
and talked about it a lot.

1489
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:50,159
They said the nuts there
were a sad sack.

1490
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:53,519
Nuts do become a sad sack.
Why wouldn't they?

1491
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:57,279
Look, if you have children,
don't give my grandkids crazy names.

1492
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,839
-What names are OK, dad?
-Tongue & Cheese.

1493
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,679
-How do you mean?
-Red Rocks, Bambi, Tongue & Cheese..

1494
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:06,319
-You don't think?
-Do you?

1495
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,799
No.

1496
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:09,439
Chuck!

1497
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:11,959
-Did you find this woman?
-Nah.

1498
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:14,959
See this woman?
She's wanted..

1499
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:19,879
Suzan, I so want to be like you,
to be the voice of the townswomen.

1500
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,119
With that voice?

1501
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:27,679
My view is you should take on
the good things about the east.

1502
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,879
My ancestors are said to come
from Central Asia, you know?

1503
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:34,319
Huh.. I can tell.

1504
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,039
You can tell from the accent, right?

1505
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:38,239
Huh.

1506
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:43,239
So it slips out
however careful I am..

1507
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:45,999
I want to unload my sins, father.

1508
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:52,839
Here.

1509
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:55,319
Can you do it with this?

1510
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:58,719
By yourself, over in the corner.
Go on.. Go on now.

1511
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:02,559
Ah, woman, ah!

1512
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:06,799
You went before your time
and left me with a goddamn crazy.

1513
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:12,319
Agh!

1514
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:17,839
Even if it was a joke, I hope you won't
lock me in a cage once we're married.

1515
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:21,799
Baby, I'd keep lions
if I had a thing for cages.

1516
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:23,759
Well... That makes sense.

1517
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:28,359
I mean, if worse comes to worst,
my parents have a house in Samatya.

1518
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:31,399
-We'll live there.
-You mean with the mother-in-law?

1519
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:37,159
OK, we'll do it like this.
I'll buy you a mansion in Emirgan.

1520
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:40,159
You can live there. With a library.
So you can read about music lore..

1521
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:42,839
Right.. So you mean
there's no escaping the law, huh?

1522
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,319
Well, musically speaking, yes.

1523
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:51,719
Do-oo re-ee mi-ii fa mi-ii..

1524
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:55,759
-You're in pain?
-Just screwed up..

1525
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,639
La mii-ii..

1526
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:05,039
Hey, not like that.
Forwards first.. Like this.

1527
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:08,759
-But we never used it in the film.
-We didn't get to shoot once, fuck it!

1528
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:10,439
Well, it's the critics that count.

1529
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:12,759
I'm giving up anyway.
This is the last comedy I do.

1530
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:15,399
You're leaving comedy.
Leaving it to who?

1531
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:19,039
Man, don't ask questions.
I'm not ready for that yet.

1532
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:21,839
Anyway, we finished the whole film
without any disasters.

1533
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:23,799
Right, thank God for that.

1534
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:25,999
-Agh!
-Fuck!

1535
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:27,999
Agh!

1536
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:31,799
-What the hell have you done?
-Wait, I'll suck out the poison.
