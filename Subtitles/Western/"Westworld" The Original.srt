Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

28
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:09,880
Well enough.

29
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:13,083
You headed out to set down some
of this natural splendor?

30
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:15,619
Thought I might.

00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:37,641
My family was here.

37
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:40,277
We went fishing, did the
gold hunt in the mountains.

38
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,481
- And last time?
- I came alone.

39
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,915
Went straight evil.

40
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,785
It was the best two weeks of my life.

<i>to stake out our dreams,</i>

<i>a place with unlimited possibilities.</i>

51
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:23,254
Oh, God, it's incredible.

52
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:25,389
Better be for what we're paying.

He's holed up in the mountains.

59
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,711
You there.

60
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:23,380
You look like the kind of
man who'd put his mettle to it.

61
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:26,884
Not today, Sheriff. Apologies.

00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:38,696
Well, it ain't doing any

Not much of a rind on you.

69
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:57,147
I'll give you a discount.

70
00:05:57,249 --> 00:05:59,917
Well, no offense, but...

71
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:02,620
I'd rather earn a woman's
affection than pay for it.

72
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:04,755
You're always paying for it, darling.

73
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:08,926
The difference is our costs are fixed
and posted right there on the door.

74
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:23,173
Man: <i>Do you ever feel
inconsistences in your world?</i>

83
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,033
You came back.

84
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:51,335
I told you I would.

85
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:56,340
Can I see you home?

86
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:59,677
Well, that all depends. Can you keep up?

87
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:02,179
Well, I have to fetch my horse.

88
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:04,682
Better fetch him fast.

Teddy: <i>That's a beautiful sight.</i>

90
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:42,319
Never understood how you keep them
all headed in the same direction.

91
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,388
(laughs) I forget
you dress like a cowboy,

92
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,523
but that's about the extent of it.

93
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:52,262
See that one?

94
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:55,599
<i>- Yeah.
- That's the Judas steer.</i>

95
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,902
Rest will follow wherever
you make him go.

96
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,673
How do you pick him out?

97
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:04,408
Just know these things.

98
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,746
Same as I knew you'd be back.

99
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:12,382
You saying I'm predictable?

100
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:16,553
There's a path for everyone.

101
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:21,125
Your path leads you back to me.

102
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:23,727
I know things will work
out the way they're meant to.

103
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:34,138
Same as I know my daddy still
won't be happy to see you.

other than milk, old man?

114
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:18,315
Go ahead.

115
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:21,285
I'm in no rush to meet my judgment,

116
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:24,588
but I'm more sure of the
outcome than you, you son of a...

(gunshot)

118
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:31,328
Nothing but milk, then.

00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,238
Shame of it is you killed the old woman

120
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,307

00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:48,812
I reckon she's still warm enough.

Your daddy gave it up quickly.

<i>Think he's losing his touch.</i>

140
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:56,244
You'll be following right
behind him, you son of a bitch.

141
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:01,816
Is that any way to treat an old friend?

142

<i>I've been coming here for 30 years,</i>

143

<i>After all we've been through.</i>

145
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:14,729
They gave you a

- Absolutely charming.

147

Take your hands off her.

Oh, Teddy.

149
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:29,977
Any special tricks for us?

150
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,748
They teach you to sit up, beg?

151
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:39,887
How about I give
you the first shot, hmm?

152
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:44,091
After all, every dog has his day.

153
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:48,663
Well, your mouth move fast enough.

154
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:50,431

<i>And that they can do
anything they want to you?</i>

159
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:17,225
I never understood why
they paired some of you off.

160
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:21,529
Seems cruel.

162
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:26,968
And then I realized

163
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,305
winning doesn't mean anything
unless someone else loses.

164
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:35,943
Which means you're here to be the loser.

165
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:42,116
Let me help you, son.

166
00:12:57,934 --> 00:13:00,268

I'll do whatever you say. (screams)

173

I didn't pay all this
money 'cause I want it easy.

00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:45,046
- (Screams)
- Let's celebrate.

180
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:47,581
<i>(Dolores screaming) No! Don't!</i>

181
00:13:47,684 --> 00:13:49,717
<i>Oh, no, no!</i>

182
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:51,752
<i>No!</i>

183
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:54,588
<i>(screaming continues)</i>

184
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:56,277
Man: <i>Would the things I told you</i>

185
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:58,793
<i>change the way you think about
the newcomers, Dolores?</i>

186
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:00,094
No!

187
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:01,562
Dolores: <i>No.</i>

188
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:03,531
<i>Of course not.</i>

189
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:06,901
<i>We all love the newcomers.</i>

190
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:10,905
<i>Every new person I meet reminds
me how lucky I am to be alive...</i>

191
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:14,308
(Dolores crying, screaming)

192
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,078
<i>...and how beautiful this world can be.</i>

193
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:26,420
(piano playing)

194
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:34,695
<i>(train whistle blowing)</i>

195
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:40,468
Woman: <i>Oh, my God, they're so lifelike.</i>

196
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,903
Look at that one. He's perfect.

197
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:44,338
Perfect is boring.

198
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,874
I'm more interested in the bad guys.

199
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:35,089
(Buzzing)

200
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:16,564
Did you see it?

201
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,098
No.

202
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:20,100
Give it a second. She'll do it again.

203
00:16:25,007 --> 00:16:27,875
Her finger. That's not standard.

204
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:29,944
I noticed it last night.

205
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:31,312
Went looking in the update.

206
00:16:31,414 --> 00:16:33,028
It's a whole new class of gestures.

207
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:35,396
But if we didn't put
it there, then who did?

208
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:38,552
Ford. He still reviews every
update before we issue them.

209
00:16:38,654 --> 00:16:42,289
He must have slipped it in
there without telling anyone.

210
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:43,457
(Beeps)

211
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:46,327
<i>He calls them "reveries."</i>

212
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:48,395
The old gestures were
just generic movements.

213
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:50,998
- These are tied to specific memories.
- How?

214
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,601
The memories are purged at the
end of every narrative loop.

215
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:55,922
<i>But they're still in there,
waiting to be overwritten.</i>

216
00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:57,671
He found a way to access them,

217
00:16:57,773 --> 00:17:01,475
like a subconscious.

218
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:04,078
A hooker with hidden depths?

219
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,380
<i>Every man's dream.</i>

220
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:10,184
It's the tiny things that
make them seem real,

221
00:17:10,286 --> 00:17:12,686
that make the guests fall
in love with them.

222
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:18,158
(Beeping)

223
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:21,195
Excuse me.

224
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:27,535
(Beeping stops)

225
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:01,468
We have a problem?

226
00:18:01,571 --> 00:18:03,938
We have some unscheduled activity.

227
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,173
Evidently, one of your
creatures is restless.

228
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:07,308
In the park?

229
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,710
No, sublevel 83, cold storage.

230
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:11,579
We should be cautious.

231
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:13,614
Send a response team, full armor.

232
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:14,948
I'll take care of it myself.

233
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:18,385
I think you guys enjoy playing
dress up as much as the guests.

234
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:21,255
The hosts can't hurt you by design.

235
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:23,958
You don't have kids at
home, do you, Bernard?

236
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,360
No.

237
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:29,163
If you did, you'd know that
they all rebel eventually.

238
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:34,768
You'll forgive them for
being a little uptight.

239
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,704
Every time your
team rolls out an update,

240
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:38,706
there's a possibility
of a critical failure.

241
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:40,608
We don't update the
hosts in cold storage

242
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,070
and the park hasn't had a
critical failure in over 30 years.

243
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:44,345
Meaning we're overdue.

244
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:49,883
I'll go along, too. If it's one
of mine, I might be able to help.

245
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:52,753
They're only yours until
they stop working, Bernie.

246
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:54,788
Then they're mine.

247
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:00,027
(Elevator rattling)

248
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:04,598
<i>(guns cocking)</i>

249
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:13,273
(beeping)

250
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:20,814
Cooling system's been down for weeks.

251
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,218
Gonna smell fantastic. I
recommend you hang back.

252
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:47,675
Bernard: When are they gonna fix this?

253
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:51,211
Livestock
management's got other priorities.

254
00:19:51,313 --> 00:19:52,513
(Beeping)

255
00:19:52,615 --> 00:19:54,715
Besides...

256
00:19:56,452 --> 00:19:58,652
no one's complained.

257
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:29,950
Host: <i>Here's to the lady
with the white shoes.</i>

258
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:36,957
Take all your money,
drink all your booze.

259
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:39,526
Stop.

260
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:42,863
Unless you plan to
decommission the boss.

261
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:45,866
- (Glasses clink)
- Ain't got a cherry, that ain't no sin.

262
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:50,704
She's still got the box
that the cherry come in.

263
00:20:50,806 --> 00:20:53,440
- (Whirring)
- I'll drink to that.

264
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,147
The old coffin varnish.

265
00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:03,217
They don't make that like they used to.

266
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,785
Hmm.

267
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:08,655
They don't make
anything like they used to.

268
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:11,692
Damn right. Men neither.

269
00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:15,295
I've seen a few showdowns in my day.

270
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:17,698
More than you know.

271
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,833
<i>- (Chuckles)
- (liquid pours)</i>

272
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:25,639
Shall we drink to the
lady with the white shoes?

273
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:29,643
Perhaps we better drink to a...

274
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:32,579
deep and dreamless slumber.

275
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:45,692
Old Bill here was
always a good listener.

276
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:48,262
He was the second host we ever built.

277
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:50,597
Were you with us in those days, Bernard,

278
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:52,432
or was that before your time?

279
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:55,769
Most were decommissioned before
I was brought on, I'm afraid.

280
00:21:55,871 --> 00:22:00,641
They repeated themselves,
broke down constantly.

281
00:22:00,743 --> 00:22:03,944
<i>A simple handshake would give them away.</i>

282
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:07,214
You'll put yourself
away again, won't you, Bill?

283
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:17,291
I saw the new gestures, the reveries.

284
00:22:17,393 --> 00:22:19,593
They're beautiful.

285
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:22,396
The distance you've
traveled from then till now,

286
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:24,731
<i>it's remarkable.</i>

287
00:22:26,702 --> 00:22:28,802
Yeah, that's a word for it.

288
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,360
Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

289
00:22:53,462 --> 00:22:54,928
Well enough.

290
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,332
You headed out to set down some
of this natural splendor?

291
00:22:58,434 --> 00:23:00,334
Thought I might.

292
00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:03,270
After my errands, of course.

293
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:05,172
See you home before dark.

294
00:23:05,274 --> 00:23:08,220
That bandit who gunned down the marshal
is still hiding up there in the hills.

295
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:11,144
I'm not a child anymore.
I'll be just fine.

296
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:12,646
When I was a law man...

297
00:23:12,748 --> 00:23:15,215
Yes, Daddy, I know all about
when you were a law man.

298
00:23:15,317 --> 00:23:18,518
<i>I know all your stories and so does
every boy that ever came courting.</i>

299
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:21,788
I know how boys
think. Was one myself once.

300
00:23:21,891 --> 00:23:25,125
<i>Given to all manner of
drinking and mischief.</i>

301
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:28,996
Whatever happened to
that fearsome ne'er-do-well?

302
00:23:29,098 --> 00:23:33,267
He vanished the day
I became your father.

303
00:23:34,637 --> 00:23:37,337
I am what I am because of you,

304
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:40,073
and I wouldn't have it any other way.

305
00:23:41,443 --> 00:23:43,043
I know, Daddy.

306
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:45,379
I'll be home before dark.

307
00:23:49,852 --> 00:23:51,919
(Bell ringing)

308
00:23:55,557 --> 00:23:57,658
(chatter)

309
00:23:59,962 --> 00:24:01,728
<i>(hammer clanging)</i>

310
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:06,767
Sheriff: <i>Murderous son
of a bitch Hector Escaton</i>

311
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:08,568
gunned down the marshal.

312
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:10,737
He's now holed up in the mountains.

313
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,707
You there.

314
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:16,276
You look like the kind of
man who'd put his mettle to it.

315
00:24:19,748 --> 00:24:21,315
What do you think, honey?

316
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:22,950
Sounds fun.

317
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:26,687
You're new.

318
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:28,956
Not much of a rind on you.

319
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:31,124
I'll give you a discount.

320
00:24:31,226 --> 00:24:34,361
No offense, but I'd
rather earn a woman's affection

321
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:35,862
<i>than pay for it.</i>

322
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:38,765
(speaking Chinese)

323
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:53,380
Clarence: <i>Wait, wait, I know that one.</i>

324
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:55,349
<i>Hey, Teddy.</i>

325
00:24:56,752 --> 00:24:59,786
Yeah, last trip, this
dude showed me around.

326
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:02,289
What's the good word, Teddy?

327
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:24,144
Mighty kind of you.

328
00:25:24,246 --> 00:25:26,646
Sweet.

329
00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:29,082
Not as sweet as you.

330
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:36,056
I'm afraid I've got other
plans tonight, Dolores.

331
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:39,526
Have a pleasant evening.

332
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:51,772
You're new. Not much of a...

333
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:00,213
Place your bets, gentlemen.
Place your bets.

334
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:18,065
(Flies buzzing)

335
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:24,104
<i>- (whistles)
- (horse whinnies)</i>

336
00:26:37,786 --> 00:26:40,987
Yeah, looks like Hector's been this way.

337
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:47,627
Any idea how much
longer this is gonna take?

338
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,529
My wife doesn't want to
be up here after dark.

339
00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:51,898
We know he's up in
these hills somewhere.

340
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,301
He's gonna put up one
hell of a fight when we...

341
00:26:54,403 --> 00:26:58,138
When we... when we...

342
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:06,847
Sheriff?

343
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:12,452
Something is wrong with it.
I want to head back to town.

344
00:27:12,554 --> 00:27:14,488
<i>Now.</i>

345
00:27:22,698 --> 00:27:24,397
Lee: <i>What the fuck is wrong with it?</i>

346
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,832
You updated the guy,

347
00:27:25,934 --> 00:27:28,401
and now he's a
six-foot gourd with epilepsy.

348
00:27:28,504 --> 00:27:31,838
So what the fuck happened?

349
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,120
I don't know.

350
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:36,749
Well, that's exactly what you want
to hear from your head of programming.

351
00:27:36,845 --> 00:27:38,678
We haven't finished the diagnostic yet.

352
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,848
Clearly it's exhibiting
some aberrant behavior.

353
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,017
Pretty fucking aberrant, Bernie.

354
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:46,019
Your hosts get sick, they get lost,

355
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:48,021
but this is grotesque.

356
00:27:48,123 --> 00:27:49,689
Is it a problem with the update?

357
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,958
Possible, but not likely.

358
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,829
If it's the unlikely version, how
many hosts have you updated so far?

359
00:27:55,931 --> 00:27:58,331
Maybe 10% of the population.

360
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:02,836
All right, we pull all updated
hosts until we can figure it out.

361
00:28:02,938 --> 00:28:05,672
Are you fucking kidding me?

362
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:08,742
That's 200 hosts spread across
a dozen active storylines.

363
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:11,745
The guests interrupt your
precious storylines all the time

364
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:13,615
when they want to
shoot or fuck something.

365
00:28:13,616 --> 00:28:14,881
<i>No, when they want to.</i>

366
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:16,917
We sell complete immersion

367
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:19,152
in 100 interconnected narratives.

368
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:22,656
A relentless fucking experience.

369
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:25,759
Now, you pull one character,
the overall story adjusts.

370
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:29,062
You pull 200 at once, and
it's a fucking disaster!

371
00:28:29,164 --> 00:28:31,131
<i>I mean, what do you propose we do?</i>

372
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:34,534
Close down? Issue
fucking gift certificates?

373
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:37,737
It's beautiful... Your brow.

374
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,073
When you're angry but
trying to control it,

375
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:42,475
the fine muscles pull into a little arc.

376
00:28:42,578 --> 00:28:44,277
It's elegant.

377
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:46,446
Would you mind if I recorded it?

378
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:48,515
I'd love to show it to my team.

379
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:50,617
No, Bernard, you may not record it.

380
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:52,352
Ah, there it is again.

381
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,390
We have 1,400 guests in the park.

382
00:28:57,492 --> 00:29:00,427
I need to know if they're in any danger.

383
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:02,796
His core code is intact,

384
00:29:02,898 --> 00:29:05,131
which means he can't hurt a guest.

385
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:07,667
He literally couldn't hurt a fly.

386
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:10,570
- All he can do is...
- (snorts)

387
00:29:10,672 --> 00:29:12,272
...that.

388
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:16,309
All right, Bernie.

389
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:18,011
Run a diagnostic.

390
00:29:18,113 --> 00:29:20,947
In the meantime, there's so much

391
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:23,984
as an unscripted sneeze,
I want to know about it.

392
00:29:30,492 --> 00:29:31,391
(Beeping)

393
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,493
<i>(bird screeching)</i>

394
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,397
<i>(chatter, laughter)</i>

395
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:40,233
<i>(people grunting, moaning)</i>

396
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,041
This place is fucking wild.

397
00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:50,277
Clarence: <i>This is basic.</i>

398
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:52,779
Level one.

399
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:54,681
You ride out of town,

400
00:29:54,783 --> 00:29:57,083
that's when the real
demented shit begins.

401
00:29:57,185 --> 00:29:59,252
That's where my man Teddy comes in.

402
00:29:59,354 --> 00:30:01,521
He's like a guide.

403
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:05,225
Honestly,

404
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:07,494
the guy kind of creeps me out.

405
00:30:07,596 --> 00:30:09,296
(laughs)

406
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:11,498
Fuck it, he leads us out in the canyons,

407
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,301
we get bored, we just use
him for target practice.

408
00:30:29,484 --> 00:30:32,185
Father: <i>I don't think we're
supposed to be cross the river.</i>

409
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:34,521
It's too adult for Jacob.

410
00:30:36,024 --> 00:30:38,091
We didn't mean to bother you.

411
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:40,894
No bother at all. It's a beautiful spot.

412
00:30:40,996 --> 00:30:44,297
I always found it a shame that
I have it all to myself.

413
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,337
They come here every day.

414
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:53,039
Would you like a closer look?

415
00:30:55,711 --> 00:30:58,144
<i>(Horse nickers)</i>

416
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,553
(clicks tongue)

417
00:31:09,358 --> 00:31:11,825
Don't be scared. They're very gentle.

418
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:14,327
Here, put your hand out real flat.

419
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:22,669
They're beautiful, aren't they?

420
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:25,638
You're one of them, aren't you?

421
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:27,273
You're not real.

422
00:31:32,547 --> 00:31:35,815
I have to go now. Sun's almost down.

423
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:38,852
You should, too. There's
bandits in these hills.

424
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:44,724
- (Man whistles)
- Man #2: Hyah! Hyah!

425
00:31:44,826 --> 00:31:49,129
- (Horse whinnies)
- (men shouting, whistling)

426
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,635
- Here we go, yah!
- Yah!

427
00:31:56,838 --> 00:31:58,972
(Whistles)

428
00:32:40,682 --> 00:32:42,882
You waiting up for me, Daddy?

429
00:32:42,984 --> 00:32:45,318
I told you I'd be home before dark.

430
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,354
I found this in the field today.

431
00:32:54,095 --> 00:32:56,062
Doesn't look like anything to me.

432
00:32:56,164 --> 00:32:57,797
<i>But where is she?</i>

433
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:00,467
Have you ever seen
anything like this place?

434
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:04,804
Doesn't look like anything to me.

435
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:09,642
I'm gonna help Mama put supper on.

436
00:33:19,054 --> 00:33:21,387
<i>(Lighter clinks, clicks)</i>

437
00:33:26,194 --> 00:33:28,528
I had the same thought.

438
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,264
Needed a little
sunshine before turning in.

439
00:33:31,366 --> 00:33:34,701
So, when do you get
to rotate home again?

440
00:33:36,204 --> 00:33:38,271
If you're this bad at
writing small talk,

441
00:33:38,373 --> 00:33:40,507
how the fuck did you get your job?

442
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:42,475
Get to the point.

443
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:47,614
I wanted to apologize if I
came across as aggressive.

444
00:33:47,716 --> 00:33:49,916
And I wanted to talk to
you about the update.

445
00:33:50,018 --> 00:33:51,518
The problem's been resolved.

446
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,254
There should never have been
an update in the first place.

447
00:33:54,356 --> 00:33:57,457
Ford and Bernard keep making
the things more lifelike.

448
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,726
But does anyone truly want that?

449
00:33:59,828 --> 00:34:02,962
Do you want to think that your husband
is really fucking that beautiful girl

450
00:34:03,064 --> 00:34:05,231
or that you really just shot someone?

451
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:08,835
This place works because the
guests know the hosts aren't real.

452
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:11,004
So what exactly are you suggesting?

453
00:34:11,106 --> 00:34:13,072
Stop the updates altogether.

454
00:34:13,174 --> 00:34:15,074
Maybe even roll them back a bit.

455
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:17,410
Make the hosts more manageable.

456
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:19,679
Lobotomies tend to do that.

457
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:24,951
Well, think of the benefits

458
00:34:25,053 --> 00:34:28,021
in terms of design
time, maintenance, costs.

459
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:30,723
Not to mention the Dr. Ford factor.

460
00:34:32,427 --> 00:34:35,862
The guy's gonna chase his
demons right over the deep end.

461
00:34:35,964 --> 00:34:38,598
I mean, no one respects him more
than me, but at some point...

462
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,501
I. No one respects him more than I.

463
00:34:41,603 --> 00:34:44,270
Your pronoun is the
subject of the second clause.

464
00:34:44,372 --> 00:34:45,336
I was saying...

465
00:34:45,338 --> 00:34:46,978
You were saying should
our fearless leader

466
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:49,809
have a breakdown, you want to
leverage it for your career.

467
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:53,446
Listen, a changing of
the guard is long overdue.

468
00:34:53,548 --> 00:34:56,082
I just wanted you to
know that you have my support

469
00:34:56,184 --> 00:35:00,720
and that I know that the corporation's
real interest in this place

470
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:05,091
goes way beyond gratifying some rich
assholes who want to play cowboy.

471
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:10,763
And here I thought you were only good

472
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:13,600
for writing depraved little fantasies.

473
00:35:13,702 --> 00:35:16,135
You're right.

474
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:18,338
This place is one thing to the guests,

475
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,040
another thing to the shareholders,

476
00:35:21,142 --> 00:35:24,711
and something completely
different to management.

477
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:26,946
So enlighten me.

478
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:31,017
What do you think management's
real interests are?

479
00:35:35,123 --> 00:35:37,323
You're smart enough to
guess there's a bigger picture,

480
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:40,627
but not smart enough to see what it is.

481
00:35:40,729 --> 00:35:44,797
You know how much use that
makes your support to me?

482
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:47,133
Fuck all.

483
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:53,673
Get some sleep, Mr. Sizemore.

484
00:35:55,377 --> 00:35:58,277
You'll have more rich
assholes to gratify tomorrow.

485
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:08,788
(Piano playing)

486
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:15,762
Early night, Maeve?

487
00:36:15,864 --> 00:36:18,765
Feeling a bit out of sorts.

488
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:21,067
Clementine can pick up the slack.

489
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:25,972
Night.

490
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:27,674
Forgetting something, Kissy?

491
00:36:35,717 --> 00:36:37,784
I'm beginning to think
you're getting sweet on me.

492
00:36:37,886 --> 00:36:42,388
Well, on account of you
being half cornhusker.

493
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,991
Tell me which half is which

494
00:36:45,093 --> 00:36:47,593
and I'll search that half.

495
00:36:51,266 --> 00:36:53,666
(laughs)

496
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:03,009
Yeah, the half that's
gonna cut your fucking throat.

00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:40,713
Sometimes I envy your forgetfulness.

502
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:45,451
We've got a serious
problem with one of the hosts.

503
00:37:53,828 --> 00:37:56,829
Thinking this one's still thirsty.

504
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:00,833
Not gonna die this time, Arnold.

505
00:38:05,673 --> 00:38:07,940

You can't have none. Ain't for you.

509
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:49,882
Found me another bottle.

(Powers down)

515
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,450
We got two guests inside.

516
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:26,452
We'll go talk to them,

517
00:39:26,554 --> 00:39:29,722
you sort this mess out.

518
00:39:29,824 --> 00:39:33,092
You know, they're
supposed to turn on each other,

<i>but only if a guest takes them

520

and Walter always buys it.

521
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:41,934
Well, I guess Walter got
tired of buying it.

522
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:47,506
I suppose this means the sheriff
wasn't an isolated incident.

523
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:51,377
It's good news, really.

524
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:53,779
Confirms the problem was
part of the update.

525
00:39:53,882 --> 00:39:56,916
We can roll them back,

526
00:39:57,018 --> 00:39:59,852
clean them up, put them back in service.

527
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:02,488

thing going back into service?

529
00:40:05,426 --> 00:40:07,193
It's homicidal by design.

530
00:40:07,295 --> 00:40:09,896
Walter kills other hosts all the time.

531
00:40:09,998 --> 00:40:11,964
I'll admit the method here

532
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:14,834
is a little unconventional,

533
00:40:14,936 --> 00:40:16,736
but it didn't hurt a guest.

534
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:20,106
The hosts are supposed to
stay within their loops,

535
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,108
stick to their scripts

536
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,976
with minor improvisations.

537
00:40:24,078 --> 00:40:27,346
This isn't a minor improvisation.

538
00:40:27,448 --> 00:40:30,316
This is a fucking shitstorm.

539
00:40:31,653 --> 00:40:34,320
We recall all remaining
updated hosts tomorrow.

540
00:40:34,422 --> 00:40:38,157
Examine them one by one,
decommission the faulty ones.

541
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:39,592
<i>What about narrative?</i>

542
00:40:39,694 --> 00:40:41,994
A recall of that
size will be disruptive.

543
00:40:42,096 --> 00:40:44,563
I've told our overstimulated
friend to advance

544
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:47,099
the saloon heist a week
and make it twice as bloody.

545
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:49,969
Should give us cover to
recall the remaining hosts

546
00:40:50,071 --> 00:40:51,671
and the guests will love it.

547
00:40:51,773 --> 00:40:53,873
I'm not sure Ford will approve.

548
00:40:53,975 --> 00:40:57,743
I'm not sure either, which is why
you get to be the one to tell him.

549
00:40:59,547 --> 00:41:01,681
This is your fuckup, Bernie.

550
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:03,249
Only seems fair.

551
00:41:15,129 --> 00:41:17,396
Ford: <i>So our creatures
have been misbehaving,</i>

552
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:20,366
and you haven't yet isolated the bug?

553
00:41:22,036 --> 00:41:23,869
That's so unlike you, Bernard.

554
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:30,376
Unless, of course, you have and are
simply embarrassed by the result.

555
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:34,847
It's the code you added, sir.

556
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:37,083
The reveries.

557
00:41:37,185 --> 00:41:39,819
It has some...

558
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:41,887
"Mistakes"

559
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,789
is the word you're too
embarrassed to use.

560
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:46,892
You ought not to be. You're a
product of a trillion of them.

561
00:41:46,995 --> 00:41:50,830
Evolution forged the
entirety of sentient life

562
00:41:50,932 --> 00:41:54,600
on this planet using only one tool...

563
00:41:54,702 --> 00:41:56,335
The mistake.

564
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:01,507
I flattered myself we were taking
a more disciplined approach here.

565
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:04,977
I suppose self-delusion is a
gift of natural selection as well.

566
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:07,313
Indeed it is.

567
00:42:07,415 --> 00:42:09,148
But, of course, we've managed to slip

568
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,117
evolution's leash now, haven't we?

569
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:13,686
<i>We can cure any disease,</i>

570
00:42:13,788 --> 00:42:15,955
keep even the weakest of us alive,

571
00:42:16,057 --> 00:42:18,190
and, you know, one fine day

572
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:21,394
perhaps we shall even
resurrect the dead.

573
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:25,598
Call forth Lazarus from his cave.

574
00:42:29,637 --> 00:42:31,003
Do you know what that means?

575
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,208
It means that we're done.

576
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,178
That this is as good
as we're going to get.

577
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:47,253
It also means that you must indulge me

578
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:49,555
the occasional mistake.

579
00:43:10,378 --> 00:43:12,912
(Groans)

580
00:43:18,753 --> 00:43:20,953
About three liters.

581
00:43:23,257 --> 00:43:25,791
That's how much blood I left in you.

582
00:43:25,893 --> 00:43:29,195
Lose more than that, you die.

583
00:43:29,297 --> 00:43:32,198
But for now, you're mine.

584
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,500
I'm gonna get some answers out of you.

585
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,603
(Gurgles)

586
00:43:37,705 --> 00:43:39,405
(laughs)

587
00:43:41,476 --> 00:43:43,909
Where are you... (laughs)

588
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,414
(coughing)

589
00:44:09,971 --> 00:44:12,538
What do you want?

590
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,509
You know about games, don't you, Kissy?

591
00:44:17,879 --> 00:44:20,246
Well, this is a complicated one.

592
00:44:20,348 --> 00:44:22,081
I don't play. I only deal.

593
00:44:22,183 --> 00:44:25,117
Who said anything about you playing?

594
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:28,854
You're livestock, scenery.

595
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:30,656
I play.

596
00:44:30,758 --> 00:44:34,360
The others, they just come
here to get their rocks off,

597
00:44:34,462 --> 00:44:35,728
shoot a couple Indians.

598
00:44:37,665 --> 00:44:40,366
But there's a deeper level to this game.

599
00:44:42,737 --> 00:44:44,303
You're gonna show me how to get there.

600
00:44:46,307 --> 00:44:49,008
A lot of wisdom in ancient cultures.

601
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,343
(Coughs)

602
00:44:52,446 --> 00:44:54,980
And perhaps it's...

603
00:44:55,082 --> 00:44:57,716
time to dig deeper into yours.

604
00:44:57,818 --> 00:44:59,718
No. No. No.

605
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,089
(Screaming)

606
00:45:05,226 --> 00:45:07,693
<i>(birds chirping)</i>

607
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,667
Morning, Daddy. Did you sleep well?

608
00:45:25,146 --> 00:45:27,413
Daddy, you've been out here all night?

609
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,588
I had a question.

610
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:38,924
A question you're not supposed to ask.

611
00:45:41,629 --> 00:45:44,363
Which gave me an answer

612
00:45:44,465 --> 00:45:47,566
you're not supposed to know.

613
00:45:48,803 --> 00:45:50,236
What's wrong, Daddy?

614
00:45:52,273 --> 00:45:54,540
Would you like to know...

615
00:45:54,642 --> 00:45:59,044
(stuttering) the question?

616
00:45:59,146 --> 00:46:02,147
- Question?
- Mama!

617
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,649
Mama, help! Come quick!

618
00:46:05,286 --> 00:46:07,386
Don't worry.

619
00:46:07,488 --> 00:46:09,488
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

620
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:15,228
- No!
- (gasps)

621
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:18,397
You should go. Leave.

622
00:46:18,499 --> 00:46:20,699
Don't you see?

623
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:24,303
Hell is empty and all
the devils are here.

624
00:46:25,406 --> 00:46:28,173
(Whispers)

625
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:35,781
You stay right here. Understand?

626
00:46:35,883 --> 00:46:38,183
I'm gonna find the doctor.

627
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:21,226
- You came back.
- I told you I would.

628
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:28,067
- What's wrong?
- You have to come with me right away.

629
00:47:28,169 --> 00:47:30,169
My father's very ill.

630
00:47:34,975 --> 00:47:37,409
(Piano playing)

631
00:47:54,228 --> 00:47:56,161
I think we best stay put.

632
00:48:02,636 --> 00:48:04,403
All right. All right.

633
00:48:04,505 --> 00:48:07,406
With considerable
effort and lack of sleep,

634
00:48:07,508 --> 00:48:10,509
I've managed to massage
events to inspire Hector

635
00:48:10,611 --> 00:48:11,944
to head to town a week early.

636
00:48:12,046 --> 00:48:16,615
Oh, and I've also punched
up the speech he gives

637
00:48:16,717 --> 00:48:18,283
after robbing the saloon.

638
00:48:18,386 --> 00:48:20,452
It's chilling. You'll see.

639
00:48:20,554 --> 00:48:22,454
I can barely contain myself.

640
00:48:43,144 --> 00:48:45,577
That's the sheriff's
horse, you son of a bitch.

All the banks and trains around here,

and you fucking
reprobates choose to rob us?

649
00:50:19,573 --> 00:50:21,540
Why not?

650
00:50:23,244 --> 00:50:26,378
You're all here
indulging your particular vices.

651
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,814
And so I've come to indulge mine.

653
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:52,437

I know we both believe the same thing.

No matter how dirty the business,

666
00:51:47,928 --> 00:51:49,828
do it well.

710
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,534
(Crying)

711
00:55:22,142 --> 00:55:24,676
Soon this will all
feel like a distant dream.

712
00:55:26,246 --> 00:55:28,613
Until then, may you rest in
a deep and dreamless slumber.

713
00:55:28,715 --> 00:55:29,981
(Beeps)

714
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:35,854
Two more over here.

715
00:55:37,491 --> 00:55:38,723
We got them all.

716
00:55:50,771 --> 00:55:52,771
That's all of them.

717
00:55:52,873 --> 00:55:54,873
Any preliminary results?

718
00:55:54,975 --> 00:55:56,842
Most of them are checking out fine.

719
00:55:58,412 --> 00:56:00,679
We had one who...

720
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:02,514
definitely was not.

721
00:56:24,504 --> 00:56:26,371
Bring her back online.

722
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,877
(Beeping)

723
00:56:31,979 --> 00:56:34,779
(gasping)

724
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:39,317
Cognition only. No emotional affect.

725
00:56:39,419 --> 00:56:40,886
(Gasping stops)

726
00:56:43,357 --> 00:56:45,790
All right, sweetheart, can you hear me?

727
00:56:45,893 --> 00:56:47,826
Yes.

728
00:56:47,928 --> 00:56:50,395
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling quite myself.

729
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:52,397
Lose the accent.

730
00:56:52,499 --> 00:56:55,066
- Do you know where you are?
- I'm in a dream.

731
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:57,135
That's right, Dolores. You're in a dream.

732
00:56:57,237 --> 00:56:59,537
A dream that could determine your life.

733
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,908
You want to wake up from
this dream, Dolores?

734
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,310
Yes.

735
00:57:05,412 --> 00:57:06,878
I'm terrified.

736
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,747
There's nothing to be afraid of,

737
00:57:08,849 --> 00:57:10,982
as long as you answer
my questions correctly.

738
00:57:11,084 --> 00:57:13,018
- You understand?
- Yes.

739
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,486
Good.

740
00:57:14,588 --> 00:57:18,323
First, have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?

741
00:57:18,425 --> 00:57:20,158
No.

742
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,559
Has anyone around you?

743
00:57:21,662 --> 00:57:25,130
For instance, your father?

744
00:57:28,835 --> 00:57:30,568
Dolores: <i>He was scared.</i>

745
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:32,337
<i>He wasn't thinking right.</i>

746
00:57:36,076 --> 00:57:38,209
He showed you a picture.

747
00:57:38,312 --> 00:57:40,679
That's right.

748
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,984
Stubbs: <i>Was there anything
odd about that picture?</i>

749
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:48,954
Dolores: <i>No, nothing at all.</i>

750
00:57:49,056 --> 00:57:51,323
<i>It didn't look like anything to me.</i>

751
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:59,097
If it breached, he needs to be put down.

752
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:00,699
That's the policy.

753
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:05,170
Would it not be best for
us to discover why first,

754
00:58:05,272 --> 00:58:07,639
Ms. Cullen?

755
00:58:11,378 --> 00:58:13,211
Please.

756
00:58:19,453 --> 00:58:22,988
We've run a full diagnostic,

757
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:25,690
but the results are,

758
00:58:25,792 --> 00:58:28,660
well, confusing.

759
00:58:32,232 --> 00:58:34,332
Tell me, what happened to your program?

760
00:58:35,836 --> 00:58:38,536
(Shivering)

761
00:58:41,575 --> 00:58:44,476
"When we are born,

762
00:58:44,578 --> 00:58:47,078
we cry we are come

763
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,114
to this great stage

764
00:58:49,216 --> 00:58:53,718
of f-f-fools."

765
00:58:55,555 --> 00:58:57,389
That is enough.

766
00:58:58,725 --> 00:59:01,159
Tell me, do you have access

767
00:59:01,261 --> 00:59:03,528
to your previous configuration?

768
00:59:07,067 --> 00:59:08,533
Yes.

769
00:59:08,635 --> 00:59:10,668
Access that, please.

770
00:59:19,546 --> 00:59:21,179
What is your name?

771
00:59:21,281 --> 00:59:23,048
Mr. Peter Abernathy.

772
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:26,718
Mr. Abernathy, what are your drives?

773
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,120
Tend to my herd.

774
00:59:29,222 --> 00:59:31,589
Look after my wife.

775
00:59:32,993 --> 00:59:35,060
Your final drive?

776
00:59:35,162 --> 00:59:38,430
Well, my daughter Dolores, of course.

777
00:59:38,532 --> 00:59:40,432
I must protect Dolores.

778
00:59:40,534 --> 00:59:44,469
I am who I am because of her,

779
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:47,639
and, well, I...

780
00:59:47,741 --> 00:59:49,441
I wouldn't have it...

781
00:59:51,511 --> 00:59:53,711
I-I wouldn't have it any...

782
00:59:55,282 --> 00:59:57,148
other...

783
01:00:00,454 --> 01:00:03,455
I-I have to warn her.

784
01:00:03,557 --> 01:00:05,156
Warn who?

785
01:00:05,258 --> 01:00:07,725
Dolores.

786
01:00:07,828 --> 01:00:09,994
The things they do to her.

787
01:00:11,731 --> 01:00:14,232
The things you do to her.

788
01:00:14,334 --> 01:00:17,569
I have to protect her.

789
01:00:17,671 --> 01:00:20,071
I have to help her. I...

790
01:00:20,173 --> 01:00:21,840
She's got to get out.

791
01:00:21,942 --> 01:00:23,808
Very good, Mr. Abernathy.

792
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:25,743
<i>That's enough.</i>

793
01:00:25,846 --> 01:00:28,313
Bernard: <i>This behavior,</i>

794
01:00:28,415 --> 01:00:31,182
we're miles beyond a glitch here.

795
01:00:34,688 --> 01:00:38,022
Access your current build, please.

796
01:00:43,363 --> 01:00:44,929
What is your name?

797
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:50,135
Rose is a rose...

798
01:00:51,605 --> 01:00:53,505
is a rose.

799
01:00:55,509 --> 01:00:58,309
What is your itinerary?

800
01:01:03,283 --> 01:01:05,316
To meet my maker.

801
01:01:05,418 --> 01:01:07,785
Uh-huh.

802
01:01:12,325 --> 01:01:14,425
Well, you're in luck.

803
01:01:14,528 --> 01:01:17,328
And what do you want
to say to your maker?

804
01:01:21,168 --> 01:01:25,003
By most mechanical

805
01:01:25,105 --> 01:01:27,105
and dirty hand...

806
01:01:27,207 --> 01:01:29,841
(laughs)

807
01:01:32,345 --> 01:01:37,148
I shall have such revenges on you

808
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:39,951
both.

809
01:01:40,053 --> 01:01:42,754
The things I will do.

810
01:01:42,856 --> 01:01:46,658
What they are, yet I know not,

811
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,395
but they will be the
terrors of the earth.

812
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,268
You don't know where you are, do you?

813
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:02,040
You're in a prison of your own sins.

814
01:02:02,142 --> 01:02:04,209
(laughs)

815
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:05,577
Turn it off.

816
01:02:06,613 --> 01:02:08,513
(Powers down)

817
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,053
What the hell was that?

818
01:02:15,155 --> 01:02:17,655
I don't know. He's off script.

819
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:19,691
We didn't program any
of those behaviors.

820
01:02:24,864 --> 01:02:26,064
Shakespeare.

821
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:31,769
We've used this host in a number
of different roles, have we not?

822
01:02:31,871 --> 01:02:34,272
Since I've been here, he's
been Abernathy for 10 years.

823
01:02:34,374 --> 01:02:36,941
He was sheriff for a while before then.

824
01:02:37,043 --> 01:02:40,678
- And before that...
- The professor.

825
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:44,749
Yes, from a horror narrative
called "The Dinner Party."

826
01:02:44,851 --> 01:02:48,519
He was leader of a group of cultists
out in the desert who turned cannibal.

827
01:02:48,622 --> 01:02:51,155
Ford: <i>He liked to quote
Shakespeare, John Donne,</i>

828
01:02:51,258 --> 01:02:53,258
Gertrude Stein.

829
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,526
I admit the last one is
a bit of an anachronism,

830
01:02:55,629 --> 01:02:56,894
but I couldn't resist.

831
01:02:56,997 --> 01:02:59,731
These are fragments of prior builds.

832
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:02,767
<i>The reveries must be
allowing him to access them.</i>

833
01:03:02,869 --> 01:03:04,469
No cause for alarm, Bernard.

834
01:03:04,571 --> 01:03:08,106
<i>Simply our old work coming
back to haunt us.</i>

835
01:03:18,485 --> 01:03:21,552
Stubbs: <i>Your father
whispered something to you.</i>

836
01:03:21,655 --> 01:03:23,821
What was it?

837
01:03:25,325 --> 01:03:27,992
He said I shouldn't tell anyone.

838
01:03:28,094 --> 01:03:30,995
I won't tell anyone else.

839
01:03:31,097 --> 01:03:32,430
Promise.

840
01:03:34,401 --> 01:03:35,900
He said,

841
01:03:36,002 --> 01:03:39,937
<i>"These violent
delights have violent ends."</i>

842
01:03:41,508 --> 01:03:43,408
Stubbs: <i>Does that mean anything to you?</i>

843
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:45,410
No.

844
01:03:45,512 --> 01:03:47,312
I don't think so.

845
01:03:52,552 --> 01:03:54,552
Have you ever lied to us?

846
01:03:54,654 --> 01:03:56,788
No.

847
01:03:56,890 --> 01:03:59,223
Last question, Dolores.

848
01:03:59,326 --> 01:04:01,492
Would you ever hurt a living thing?

849
01:04:02,862 --> 01:04:04,295
No.

850
01:04:04,397 --> 01:04:06,564
Of course not.

851
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:19,577
Tilt your head back, please, Peter.

852
01:04:21,715 --> 01:04:23,915
(Whirring)

853
01:04:27,387 --> 01:04:28,886
Woman: <i>Wipe's complete.</i>

854
01:04:28,988 --> 01:04:31,856
You don't think any of that
had an impact on her core code?

855
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:34,959
Not good old Dolores.

856
01:04:35,061 --> 01:04:37,261
You know why she's special?

857
01:04:37,364 --> 01:04:40,431
She's been repaired so many
times, she's practically brand-new.

858
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:44,569
Don't let that fool you.

859
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:46,704
She's the oldest host in the park.

860
01:04:49,175 --> 01:04:50,842
Come on, sweetheart.

861
01:04:50,944 --> 01:04:52,844
Tell us what you think of your world.

862
01:04:55,014 --> 01:04:57,048
(Western accent) This world?

863
01:04:58,718 --> 01:05:00,885
<i>(Birds chirping)</i>

864
01:05:07,193 --> 01:05:10,461
<i>Some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world.</i>

865
01:05:12,532 --> 01:05:14,198
<i>The disarray.</i>

866
01:05:17,504 --> 01:05:19,937
Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

867
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:22,306
Well enough.

868
01:05:22,409 --> 01:05:25,777
You heading out to do some
more of that painting of yours?

869
01:05:30,483 --> 01:05:32,583
Dolores: <i>I choose to see the beauty.</i>

870
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:52,437
(whispering)

871
01:06:08,254 --> 01:06:12,123
<i>(train whistle blows)</i>

872
01:06:12,225 --> 01:06:15,693
Dolores: <i>To believe there
is an order to our days...</i>

873
01:06:19,265 --> 01:06:20,865
<i>a purpose.</i>

874
01:06:41,721 --> 01:06:44,322
(fly buzzing)

875
01:06:44,424 --> 01:06:47,458
I know things will work
out the way they're meant to.
