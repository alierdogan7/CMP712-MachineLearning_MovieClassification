Hi, Will!

30
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,599
Been sittin' up in the
mine for two days.

31
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,434

32

was you, I sure wouldn't have...

34
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,733
Never mind. Just tell me
what you're telling me.

35
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,318
You should've been here, Willett!

36
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,738
Lettin' me go on thinkin'
everyone's dead and me next.

37
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,824
I pulled up fever-sick,
I said, Coley.

38
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,660
Now, become calm and tell me
in a way I can understand.

39
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,161
Where is Coigne?

40
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:32,958
Well, like I said, after you was gone Leland
and Coigne decided to run into Winslow.

41
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:34,793
For the pleasure, Coigne says.

42
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:36,795
"Can I go?" He says no.

43
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,965
"Someone's gotta watch over stores
and things, so you stay, Coley."

44
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:42,259
Well, then they go off.

45
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,852
Not comin' back till
next morning, early.

46
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:48,390
I get waked by them
pounding in like hell-bent.

47
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,602
Then I hear 'em talking mad and arguing,
so as I conclude they're drunk.

48
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:55,897
I mean to go back to sleep when your
brother Coigne tears inside here...

49
00:05:55,997 --> 00:05:58,692
and grabs up his roll
mad as I ever seen.

50
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,694
I said, "What are you doing, Coigne?"

51
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,780
"Shut up," he says.
"I am taking your horse."

52
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,532
And he tears back out.

53
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,869
Sure enough, I see him throw
onto my Shorty and dig out fast.

54
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:12,080
And there stands Leland,
spittin' in the dust, disgusted.

55
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,750
"How come Coigne rode off
that-a-way, Leland?"

56
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,462
"He rode a man and a little person
down in the streets of Winslow.

57
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:20,881
Maybe it was a child," Leland says.

58
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,425
"But did he kill 'em?" I ask.

59
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:27,144
"He's not for sure, but he ain't waitin'
to find out, and now he's runnin'."

60
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,057
"Oh, I hate to hear it," I says.

61
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:34,234
Then I crawls back in to sleep,
assuming Leland done the same.

62
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:36,688
But damned if I don't
get waked again.

63
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:39,232
Leland's voice I hear,
and I don't know whose.

64
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:43,528
Thinking it's your brother, I open up the
flap and look out at Leland drinking coffee.

65
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:47,240
I can't see nothing else, so I ask,
"Who you talking to, Leland?"

66
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,619
He looks like he's makin' to answer
or to take a mouth of coffee...

67
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,663
- when just like that...
- (GUNSHOT)

68
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:56,166
his face all spitters out...

69
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:59,169
spilling in his coffee
and all over hisself...

70
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:02,172
with none of his
face left on with it.

71
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:05,801
I reckon someone come to settle with Coigne
on account of what happened in Winslow...

72
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:07,469
and got Leland instead.

73
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:10,771
Figurin' I'm next, I jumped
back inside, scared white.

74
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:16,645
Give me the whips and
jingles so bad, Will, I...

75
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:18,779
I can't yet catch hold of myself.

76
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:22,901
Is that the whole way of it, Coley?

77
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:25,702
I believe. (GRUNTING)

78
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,539
My mind's all unsatisfied with it.

79
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:32,452
Seem to me like if Leland had been
involved with the event in Winslow...

80
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,747
he'd have rode off too, wouldn't he,
like the way you told me Coigne done.

81
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:41,211
Run a man and a little person down.
That's all Leland said. Maybe it was a child.

82
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,005
He's just a-sittin' there,
gettin' killed that-a-way?

83
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:46,299
I got no understanding of it at all.

84
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,052
- It's a terrible thing.
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:51,304
- Give me hold of your gun, Coley.
- What you want it for?

86
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,723
I might be gonna need it,
so just give it to me.

87
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:57,602
No. I might be just a-needin' it too.
How do I know? All these happenings.

88
00:07:57,702 --> 00:08:00,147
I hate to tell ya,
all riled up like you are...

89
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,567
but I been trailed most of the
way here by I don't know who.

90
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:06,820
Where's your own gun?
Go on and use your own gun.

91
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,156
Well, it plainly ain't there,
or I wouldn't be asking you.

92
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,825

trouble on the way.

93
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,542

And I can't get me no sleep
without you give it to me.

95
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,797

out the other way around.

101
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:55,702

I believe Will, he does too.

172
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,514
(CHUCKLES)

173
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:46,386
I like the brown one!

174
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,222
I'm gon' give you that
black over there, miss.

175
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,767
He belonged to a dead man,
so's you don't have to pay for him.

176
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:57,028
Coley, fetch Leland's pony
out with just a bridle on her.

177
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,195
What about Coigne's, Will?

178
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:06,246
Well, he looks stove up.

179
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,624
Then I don't wanna be stuck with him.

180
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,745
Are you looking at me, Mr. Gashade?

181
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,747
WILL: How do you come by that name?

182
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,250
I hear you're a bounty
hunter, Mr. Gashade.

183
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,003
- I wouldn't name myself as that.
- No?

184
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:22,589
WILL: It was just a way
of making wages once.

185
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:26,224
- And now?
- Mining suits me just.

186
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,186
Well, you look less
than prosperous at it.

187
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:41,357
How much would you ask to take me
across the Supuecio to Kingsley?

188
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,109
I ain't askin'.

189
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,828
I told you I'd pay you very well.

190
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,956
And I said I'm doing just fine.

191
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,085
Look at me, Mr. Gashade.

192
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:57,123
Without perishing from the
tricks of my own mind...

193
00:15:57,223 --> 00:16:00,133
how could I possibly get
to Kingsley on my own?

194
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,838
Well, I ain't the only one
knows the way, ma'am.

195
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:06,139
But it's you I'm asking.

196
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:14,356
Please think about it.

197
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:18,735
That's just what I'm doing.

198
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:24,282
Really nice pony you had here, miss.

199
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,620
Looks to me like you run
him to death though.

200
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:34,751
Good pony like this hard to come by.

201
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:40,340
What'd you shoot him for?

202
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,427
There ain't a broke or
unsound bone in his body.

203
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,021
WOMAN: I'll give you 500 now
and 500 when we get there.

204
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,394
How long would it take?
Two weeks? Three?

205
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:03,773
How much gold could you dig out of
this mine in three weeks, Mr. Gashade?

206
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:05,692
Three weeks?

207
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,527
Let me figure.

208
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,828
Oh, I'd say, bein' it's a...

209
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,999
pretty dead hole, why, uh...

210
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,703
Well, it wouldn't be
a hell of a much.

211
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,371
Would you say, Will?

212
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,915
COLEY: Yeah, I done the
best I could for ol' Lee.

213
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:25,294
By the time I got out my gun to help,
why, he was already dead.

214
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:27,714
And what with Will's
brother run off...

215
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:32,218
well, there was only me to
do the best I know how...

216
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,060
for ol' Leland Drum.

217
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:36,688
It isn't April.

218
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:40,191
- What's that?
- It's March.

219
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:43,563
Oh.

220
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:47,866
"His good friend in... March?"

221
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:56,451
COLEY: She don't like me much.

222
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:58,494
WILL: I don't know.

223
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:01,122
COLEY:
Sure holds out good wages though.

224
00:18:01,222 --> 00:18:03,374
WILL: Yep.

225
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:05,293
But for what she don't say.

226
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:07,594
Take her to Kingsley, she say.

227
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,965
We'll see.

228
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:12,849
We're goin'?

229
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:15,351
I don't know.

230
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:18,188
What, Will?

231
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,100
Well, if Coigne got in bad...

232
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,103
He went and harmed someone
or killed someone...

233
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,855
A man and a little person.

234
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:29,157
I'm wondering why nobody's
come out here a-lookin' after him.

235
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,536
Maybe it was a child.

236
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:41,162
- Well, ma'am, I gotta...
- This water is not clean.

237
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:42,705
In fact, it's stagnant!

238
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:44,957
(GROANS) Please!

239
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,633
H-Hold on.

240
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:49,295
Do frogs breed in this water?

241
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,838
Not frogs.

242
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:53,800
- Well, what then?
- Oh, other things.

243
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,600
Here!

244
00:18:56,152 --> 00:18:58,353
- (YELLS)
- Oh, I'm sorry!

245
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:01,474
Phew! What is that?

246
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,934
COLEY: Well, it's all I could find.

247
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:06,145
There's some type of snakes knowed
to take a romp in that water.

248
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,147
- In this water?
- Oh, yeah.

249
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,817
And people been knowed to swallow
one of their little eggs...

250
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,778
and it'll hatch out inside 'em without
they's knowing it till it's too late.

251
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:15,905
What do you mean, too late?

252
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:19,700
Well, suppose it was a poison snake
and it hatch out hungry, as they do.

253
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,620
Well, what's it gonna eat but the
nearest thing to it? And that's you.

254
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,832
- (LAUGHING)
- Not me, because I didn't swallow any of it.

255
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,875
Well, you're lucky then.

256
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:30,510
Say, ma'am. Uh, ma'am?

257
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:34,889
Uh, I been considerin', and,
uh, I got an offer to make.

258
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:37,885
- Say, ma'am?
- Yes?

259
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:39,801
I'll take you up to
Kingsley like you asked,

260
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:42,931
but Coley here's gonna
have to go along with me.

261
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:46,401
And that's why I'm askin'
a thousand dollars...

262
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,320
so's I can pay him too.

263
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,907
Then there's that five you
mentioned when I get you there.

264
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:56,904
That's it.

265
00:19:57,004 --> 00:19:58,788
That's my offer.

266
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,371
All right.

267
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,672
Not fine, but all right.

268
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,959
Let's get started.

269
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,961
- Take it, Coley.
- No!

270
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:14,262
You take it, Mr. Gashade.

271
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,719
I'm ready to go.

272
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,596
We'll go tomorrow.

273
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:23,097
Now.

274
00:20:23,197 --> 00:20:25,641
Morning always makes a good start.

275
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:28,352
Would you like to go with me now?

276
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:29,937
Me?

277
00:20:30,037 --> 00:20:31,821
- Why, sure.
- Coley.

278
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,033
Take up the money then.

279
00:20:35,376 --> 00:20:37,535
- Coley...
- Go on!

280
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,282
- Coley!
- What, Will?

281
00:20:41,382 --> 00:20:43,242
Pack the mule.

282
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,785
WOMAN: No mule.

283
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:48,414
I do not intend to be
held back by any mule.

284
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:51,417
Ain't nothin' will hold you
back like no vittles, ma'am.

285
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,343
No mule!

286
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,220
Gashade! Do you know Cross Tree?

287
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,065
- I do.
- Well, head for there, please.

288
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:10,603
Cross Tree ain't Kingsley.

289
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:13,321
Never mind. First, Cross Tree!

290
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:16,776
- It's out of the way.
- By how much?

291
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,653
Twenty, 25 miles.

292
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:20,453
Which way?

293
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,959
Well, we'll have to go faster then.

294
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,329
Yes, sir.

295
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:31,631
You run on four now,
you walk on two later.

296
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,384
Haul freight, Coley!

wind-broke, damned droop-naped,
galled stumbler...

303
00:22:16,227 --> 00:22:18,170
Coigne went and stuck me with.

And takin' Shorty,
who was as sound as a nickel.

Hell! (SPITS)

306
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:28,806
You can't haul no pale-pink, ratty,
walleyed devil mule behind no horse...

307
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:31,017
that ain't got the
sense to switch flies!

308
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:33,860
Whew! No kiddin'.

309
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,863
This ain't no fun.

310
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,785
Howdy, miss.

311
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:47,498
We're stoppin', I guess.

312
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:58,843
She stalled again?

313
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,597
Unpack the grub out of
those mules and let's eat.

that you be fond of me.

319

Tend the mule.

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,080

321
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,214

do you think that maybe I could
call you by your name or somethin'?

to think of a lady-type name.

Yeah. There's my mama's name.

call her that though.

00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,475
Hah! Hah! Hah!

683
00:49:19,974 --> 00:49:23,009
Ain't you got no wipes?
Here. You can use mine.

684
00:49:24,145 --> 00:49:25,845
BILLY: Move along.

685
00:49:47,126 --> 00:49:50,328
(BLUSTERING)

686
00:49:56,343 --> 00:49:58,878
- (BLUSTERS)
- Hold up!

687
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:06,552
You can feel that, can't ya,
that horse goin' lame?

688
00:50:08,022 --> 00:50:11,683
No, no. That ain't gonna make
no difference to the horse.

689
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:13,969
Gonna make a difference
to you, that's all...

690
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:16,396
bein' it's your grub you're
tossin' off, not mine.

691
00:50:17,364 --> 00:50:21,067
You're willin' to destruct
everything, even yourself.

692
00:50:24,163 --> 00:50:25,863
(EXHALES)

693
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:30,118
Quit with that.

694
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:37,667
BILLY: I say somethin' to you?

695
00:50:44,725 --> 00:50:49,303
I don't give a curly-hair, yellow-beard,
double-dog damn if you did.

696
00:50:57,279 --> 00:50:59,856
I'm gonna blow your face off.

697
00:51:25,307 --> 00:51:27,042
COLEY: Two up on old Frazier?

698
00:51:27,142 --> 00:51:29,420
Sure gonna be pretty nasty for him.

699
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,422
- You wanna walk?
- Nah, but hell.

700
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:33,674
Why wouldn't she get on behind me?

701
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:37,511
If you don't shake your mind loose of her,
I got no respect for you, damn it.

702
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:39,930
You don't remember her near
shootin' your head off?

703
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,731
(CHIRPS)

704
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,190
- Will?
- What?

705
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:53,319
I got a funny feelin'. I don't
even know if to say or not.

706
00:51:53,419 --> 00:51:56,363
Well, don't then.
Just try shuttin' up, damn it!

707
00:51:56,463 --> 00:51:58,783
- I don't wanna lose this horse.
- Okay, okay, Willett.

708
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:00,618
I'm likely just
spookin' again anyhow.

709
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:03,704
Triple them wages and triple 'em again.
I ain't goin' that far.

710
00:52:03,804 --> 00:52:05,706
You moo to me one more
time 'bout her...

711
00:52:05,806 --> 00:52:07,458
and I'm gon' knock you
down without a word.

712
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:09,376
I wasn't talkin' about her.

713
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:13,130
Well, you went and give up your horse
to her so easy it makes me sick.

714
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,883
- And here you are now a burden to mine.
- I'm sorry, Willett.

715
00:52:15,983 --> 00:52:20,137
Well, just shut up. I can't
take no more of ya. No, sir.

716
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,515
For all the dirty rotten
gall and hate of a thing...

717
00:52:22,615 --> 00:52:25,392
that ought never above the
ground be called a woman.

718
00:52:25,492 --> 00:52:27,102
No, sir.

719
00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:29,104
I've lost it.

720
00:52:29,204 --> 00:52:30,815
Will you please go ahead now?

721
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:32,782
Take on Coley then.

722
00:52:34,043 --> 00:52:36,244
Light down and change the damn packs.

723
00:52:38,881 --> 00:52:41,374
No! You take him.

724
00:52:42,635 --> 00:52:45,253
You wanna ride with me, boy?

725
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,216
Leave him.

726
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:52,802
You better be japin'.

727
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,672
I ain't.

728
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:57,849
Mr. Gashade, it's not a bad idea.

729
00:52:58,943 --> 00:53:02,019
We'll make better time,
and then we can come back for him.

730
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,856
You'll need this pack, Coley.

731
00:53:05,324 --> 00:53:07,024
Take it off.

732
00:53:07,826 --> 00:53:08,853
Will?

733
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:11,112
It's all right. You ain't stayin'.

734
00:53:11,747 --> 00:53:15,449
You see? You see, just this minute,
he's taking up time.

735
00:53:16,085 --> 00:53:17,695
I have to insist that he stays.

736
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:21,956
Come on. Get back up here, Coley.
He'll ride ya just fine.

737
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,001
(HAMMER COCKS)

738
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,509
WILL: You see the way of it, Coley?

739
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:39,098
You'll be all right here.
You just bide it easy.

740
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:41,851
I'll come back for you.

741
00:53:42,778 --> 00:53:45,222
How long you think that'll be, Will?

742
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,732
Bring me over the guns, boy.

743
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:01,704
Not long.

744
00:54:05,259 --> 00:54:07,877
They ain't got left
but one sack of grub.

745
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:11,756
And no way of knowin' it I ain't
gonna lead 'em straight into hell.

746
00:54:16,103 --> 00:54:17,803
Move on.

747
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:21,349
Coley?

748
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,574
Find some shade.

749
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,671
Oh, wait, miss.

750
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:58,511
Can I get my things out of there?

751
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:12,441
Oh, I almost forgot.

752
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:21,951
- Thank you, Coley.
- It's all right.

753
00:55:24,546 --> 00:55:26,414
See y'all later, I guess.

754
00:55:30,552 --> 00:55:33,004
You wanna ride with me, boy?

755
00:55:36,558 --> 00:55:41,053
Okay. I'd soon not get left
behind here like this.

756
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:45,300
How'd you like the way
I done Leland Drum?

757
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,178
Like I say, I'll blow it
off the first word out.

758
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:50,146
Go sit down over there.

759
00:56:04,253 --> 00:56:06,203
And think on this:

760
00:56:06,713 --> 00:56:08,615
Far as your voice gonna carry...

761
00:56:08,715 --> 00:56:12,960
ain't too far for me to turn right
round and hit you in the eye.

762
00:56:18,892 --> 00:56:22,428
Your brain gonna fry out here.
You know that?

763
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:38,110
Oh, Willett.

764
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,868
It's easier to stay behind.

765
00:56:48,755 --> 00:56:51,290
If I let you go too, would you go?

766
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:55,829
Do you hear what I'm saying?

767
00:56:55,929 --> 00:56:57,498
I could've left anytime.

768
00:56:57,598 --> 00:56:59,715
I'm talking about now.

769
00:57:01,935 --> 00:57:03,969
I got my reasons for stayin'.

770
00:57:04,771 --> 00:57:06,256
WOMAN: Reasons?

771
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,557
There ain't gonna be no kill.

772
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:13,979
The reason, Mr. Gashade,
for a hunt is the kill.

773
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:23,273
Are you talkin' to me?

774
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,074
No, Billy.

775
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:29,286
Feel like you was.

776
00:57:29,922 --> 00:57:32,123
It was just to myself.

777
00:57:34,218 --> 00:57:36,912
BILLY: I've read a person's thoughts.

778
00:57:37,012 --> 00:57:39,046
Many times.

779
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,634
You never take those off, do you?

780
00:57:46,438 --> 00:57:47,923
He talkin' to me?

781
00:57:48,023 --> 00:57:50,092
Not even with a woman.

782
00:57:50,192 --> 00:57:52,268
What'd he have to say?

783
00:58:01,036 --> 00:58:03,237
He knows why you're here.

784
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:13,456
I wouldn't worry after
your friend, you know.

785
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:17,418
He's got a real relaxin'
time compared to us.

786
00:58:18,637 --> 00:58:21,922
No, that's right. No worries.

787
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:26,886
He's where I want him, back there.
Clear and safe of you.

788
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,381
WILL: Look at that.

789
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:11,089
Wait! I'll go first now.

790
00:59:11,189 --> 00:59:13,390
Billy, keep him back a way.

791
00:59:44,056 --> 00:59:45,756
Who is he?

792
00:59:48,143 --> 00:59:49,885
BILLY: Ask her.

793
00:59:53,774 --> 00:59:55,474
WILL: You know him?

794
00:59:58,612 --> 01:00:00,479
She payin' you good for this?

795
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,899
(SIGHS) Good as you.

796
01:00:07,412 --> 01:00:09,697
WILL:
Twice as much wouldn't buy you off.

797
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:14,451
Yeah, I figured you'd
likely do it for nothin'.

798
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,999
- BILLY: Nearly nothin'.
- WILL: What for?

799
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,421
For her?

800
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:28,757
What does she mean to you?

801
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:32,720
She liked me.

802
01:00:43,031 --> 01:00:45,232
You know anything about her?

803
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:47,610
Her name even?

804
01:00:51,498 --> 01:00:53,198
Ask her.

805
01:00:59,005 --> 01:01:00,831
What lies in that direction?

806
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,628
- More of the same.
- No, but beyond that.

807
01:01:08,306 --> 01:01:10,083
- Kingsley.
- You're right.

808
01:01:10,183 --> 01:01:12,551
Kingsley, Gashade, not hell.

809
01:01:13,145 --> 01:01:16,013
What about him?
He don't interest you?

810
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:19,009
WOMAN: No, not now. His leg's broken.

811
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:21,928
- WILL: Who is he?
- Just a friend.

812
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:23,430
Friend, huh?

813
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:25,515
(CHUCKLES) Like me and him.

814
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:27,816
Yes, like you and Billy.

815
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,982
Where's his horse?
I don't see no horse.

816
01:01:34,082 --> 01:01:37,569
He must have wandered away.
You thinking of Coley?

817
01:01:37,669 --> 01:01:40,704
WILL: Yeah. He could've used it.

818
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:44,917
Bein' as you're leavin' that poor jay
a-layin' out there starin' up at the sun.

819
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,621
I left him some water.

820
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:49,421
Well, ain't that somethin'?

821
01:01:51,224 --> 01:01:52,876
Why didn't you just shoot him?

822
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:57,346
(SNORTS) Billy, did you
ever leave behind a friend?

823
01:01:57,898 --> 01:01:59,807
I never did have one.

824
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,644
How about you, Willett?

825
01:02:04,196 --> 01:02:05,896
It's different.

826
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,857
He's better off where he's at.

01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:47,122
This mornin'.

01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:57,466
- Let's eat him.
- No, Billy.

831
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:00,128
You don't want any?

832
01:04:00,228 --> 01:04:01,553
It's candy.

833
01:04:02,564 --> 01:04:04,890
It's all I got to give. I'm sorry.

834
01:04:06,693 --> 01:04:08,678

can't help you none...

'em as fast as I can.

838
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:19,488
That way, you say.

839
01:04:23,877 --> 01:04:25,577
What?

840
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:29,998
Oh, oh, sure. I-I'll be back for ya.

Here now.

You take one of these too.
Which one'd you like?

That 'un? (CHUCKLES)

846
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:49,935
I'm surprised. Most people
wouldn't have chose that 'un.

847
01:04:52,197 --> 01:04:54,015
Huh? What?

like that, what you're doin'.
