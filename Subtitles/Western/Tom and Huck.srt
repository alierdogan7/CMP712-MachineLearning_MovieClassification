You comin' along?

1018
01:28:29,294 --> 01:28:34,197
I guess I got to.
Somebody's gotta look out for ya.

1019
01:28:34,266 --> 01:28:37,963
Civilization can be
a pretty dangerous place.

1020
01:28:38,036 --> 01:28:40,436
So...

1021
01:28:40,505 --> 01:28:43,770
you ready to go put some gray hairs
on your aunt's head?

1022
01:28:43,842 --> 01:28:46,333
Whatcha got in mind?

1023
01:28:46,411 --> 01:28:48,470
