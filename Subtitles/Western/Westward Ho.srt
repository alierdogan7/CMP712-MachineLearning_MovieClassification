00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:40,316
Covered wagon

2
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:46,322
Rolling westward ho

3
00:01:47,824 --> 00:01:51,327
Covered wagon

4
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:57,333
O'er the plains we go

5
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:03,339
Dry and dreary

6
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:08,845
Weak and weary

7
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,347
Rolling

8
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:16,853
Westward ho

9
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:23,493
Reelin', rockin'
rollin'

10
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:28,498
Covered wagon

11
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:32,502
Over

12
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:35,004
The prairies That's my favorite song, Jim.

13
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,009
We roam? Aw, it's too quiet. I like
some of them soldier battle songs.

14
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:44,013
Reelin', rockin'
rollin'

15
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:49,018
Covered wagon

16
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,024
Over the prairies

17
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:58,027
To home Kinda tired, ain't you, Ma?

18
00:02:58,062 --> 00:03:00,530
No, Mark.
Not very.

19
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:03,032
You can't fool
this old horse trader.

20
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:08,037
I've been over these trails too many times
not to know your first trip is a tough one.

21
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:11,040
But Mark, don't you think we
better be stoppin' for supper?

22
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,543
Those youngsters back there
are most likely starved.

23
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:17,046
Well, it won't take us so long
to get out of the desert, Ma.

24
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:21,551
Before the yonder range
we'll camp for the night.

25
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:24,053
John, this sure is
lots of fun.

26
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:27,056
I wonder why Dad never took
us on any of his other trips.

27
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:31,561
'Cause it ain't safe. It ain't safe
for older folks, much less kids.

28
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:34,564
And anyhow, schoolin'
was more important.

29
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,066
Aw, I don't like school none.

30
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:40,069
Anyway, I ain't seen
an injun yet.

31
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:44,073
I'd like to see one. I'd shoot
him right 'tween the eyes.

32
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:46,576
Put that gun down
'fore you get hurt.

33
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:51,080
I'd like to see some badmen. I'd
show 'em how bad a fella could be.

34
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:11,100
I hope you like it
out west, Ma.

35
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:13,102
It'll take us a little while
to get settled,

36
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:16,105
but, uh, we'll be gettin' in
on the ground floor.

37
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,107
We'll make a go of it, Mark.

38
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:21,611
I'll be a heap happy to see you
settling down to ranchin'...

39
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:24,113
and give up this freight haulin'
all over the west.

40
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:28,117
The boys are growing up, and they'll
be needing you a lot more now, Mark.

41
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:31,120
I guess you're right, Ma.

42
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:35,625
I've been awful lucky. I'm gonna be
glad to get out of it with a whole skin.

43
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,502
Ho.

44
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:52,508
Ballard, the Wyatt outfit's headed
this way, across the Buckhorn trail.

45
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,513
- How much stock, Red?
- Oh, I'd say around 200 head.
Good beef stuff too.

46
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:01,017
Zeddie says he could use a few
hundred head at a fair price.

47
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:05,021
How big an outfit with Wyatt?
Just a few hands. Oughta be easy.

48
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:10,026
Good. Get mounted. We'll hit them
before they get across the desert.

49
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,213
Red, you and Chuck ride straight
for the wagons a-shootin'.

50
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:07,717
Bronc, you and Sloppy ride
out in front to head a getaway.

51
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:10,720
The rest o' ya,
ride for the cattle.

52
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:13,222
We'll burn the wagons. Heel!

53
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,733
They're- They're trail jumpers.
Ma, take the line.

54
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:35,745
Hyah! Hyah-yah-yah-yah!

55
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,302
Unharness them horses.

56
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:37,807
We got every hand, Ballard. And the
cattle's on their way to the camp.

57
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:40,810
Put up your hands
or I'll dr-

58
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:42,812
Wait a minute, Red.

59
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:47,316
He's a spunky little critter.
Let's take him along.

60
00:07:54,323 --> 00:07:59,328
- Fire them wagons.
Yah! Yah! Yah!

61
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:02,832
Let's get outa here.

62
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:40,870
Mother.

63
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,671
And as you gentlemen know,

64
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,674
the discovery of gold in
this state has encouraged...

65
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:38,678
every outlaw and criminal west of the
Mississippi to move in here among you.

66
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:43,683
They're growing fast-
stealing, destroying, murdering,

67
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:47,687
and living by their guns at the expense
of the decent and respectable citizens.

68
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:51,190
They outnumber law enforcement 20 to 1.

69
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:55,695
The honest people are so terrorized by
them that they're leaving the country.

70
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,700
Unless something is done soon, the towns
will be filled with nobodybutoutlaws.

71
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:03,703
Why are you
so interested, my boy?

72
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:08,207
Since childhood, I've lived
on the trail of bandits-

73
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:12,712
hunting the men who murdered
my parents, stole my brother.

74
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:16,716
If it takes the rest of my life,
I'll continue to hunt them down.

75
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:19,218
And at the same time,
with the proper aid,

76
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,221
I can do a good service
to this country.

77
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,227
Just what do you expect
the state to do?

78
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,730
Only this:

79
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:35,735
I'm asking you to provide
guns, ammunition, horses...

80
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,737
and the men that I'll select.

81
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:41,240
And I promise you, I'll rid this
state of every bandit that's in it...

82
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,242
and make your trails
safe to travel.

83
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:46,746
Young man, I speak for myself,

84
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,749
but I voice the opinion of all.

85
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,753
Your plan is splendid,
and we admire your courage,

86
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:58,257
but it takes money to provide you the men
and the necessary equipment you ask for.

87
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:01,761
The state treasury is without
funds for such a purpose.

88
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:06,766
Our tax collections at this time are not
enough to take care of our present obligations,

89
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:09,769
much less added ones.

90
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:13,773
Therefore, we are powerless
to accept your offer.

91
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,282
- I see.
- I only wish...

92
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:25,785
I could help you personally.

93
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,788
Thank you.

94
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:31,290
With money or no money...

95
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:36,295
I'll organize a band of men and drive
every bandit gang out of this country.

96
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,803
Good night, gentlemen.

97
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,682
Howdy.
You Carter?

98
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,684
That's right.

99
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,254
And the answer, men, is...

100
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,257
we must band together.

101
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:14,760
You, Carter, and you, Russell...

102
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:18,264
and every man here has suffered
from the injustice of these gangs.

103
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,267
And it's up to us
to clean them out.

104
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:24,270
Now, my plan is this:

105
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:34,280
Every man here will ride a white horse,
wear a black shirt and a white scarf,

106
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:37,783
and this way we'll know
each other in battle.

107
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:43,289
And I'm asking for single men
only, and men who will stick.

108
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,791
Now, who will join me
here? You can depend on me.

109
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:48,294
Me too. I'm with ya. You can count on me.

110
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:50,296
Good.

111
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,298
We'll call ourselves Vigilantes.

112
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,801
Looks like we're with you to
the man, Cap'. I'm glad we are.

113
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:59,805
It's about time.

114
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:29,335
Covered wagon

115
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:35,341
Rolling westward ho

116
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,346
Covered wagon

117
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:43,349
O'er the plains

118
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:46,852
We go

119
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:52,358
Dry and dreary

120
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:57,863
Weak and weary

121
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,366
Rolling

122
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:06,372
Westward ho

123
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:12,378
Reelin', rockin', rollin'

124
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:17,516
Covered wagon

125
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:24,523
Over the prairies

126
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:28,027
We roam

127
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:33,032
Reelin', rockin', rollin'

128
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:38,037
Covered wagon

129
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:44,043
Over the prairies

130
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,546
To home

131
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:53,552
Covered wagon

132
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:59,058
Rolling westward ho

133
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,063
Covered wagon

134
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:06,565
O'er the plains

135
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,569
We go

136
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:15,441
Dry and dreary

137
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:20,946
Weak and weary

138
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,949
Rolling

139
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,453
Westward

140
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:32,958
Ho

141
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,710
Captain looked
kinda disappointed today...

142
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:37,212
when he didn't locate
the fellow he's after...

143
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,214
after comin'
all the way over here.

144
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,717
Yeah, but that
won't stop him.

145
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:46,221
He'll rid the country of every
outlaw gang till he finds his man.

146
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,223
You haven't been
with us long.

147
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:52,227
Wait till you see how he works.
Who is it he's always lookin' for?

148
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:56,231
Don't know for sure.
Cap' ain't never said.

149
00:16:56,266 --> 00:17:00,235
All kinds of stories, but
that's a private affair with him.

150
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,238
When we were recruited, he said
he wanted to make the west...

151
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,240
a decent and safe place
to live.

152
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,493
Oh, Carter.

153
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,497
Have the boys mount up.

154
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,500
We'll go into Red Bluff
and spend the evening.

155
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:19,004
Maybe some of the boys would like a little
sarsaparilla. Maybe they would. Me too.

156
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,507
I'll tell 'em.

157
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:26,028
Band of Vigilantes
Sons of pioneers

158
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:30,032
And we like to work up
chasing bandits down

159
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:34,536
We are sons of tribulations
to the outlaws of this nation

160
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:38,540
When we're ridin' down
that rocky road to town

161
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:40,542
Seeing we're out
like buckaroos

162
00:17:40,577 --> 00:17:42,544
Let the outlaws
hear the news

163
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:47,049
That the Vigilante men
will ride them down

164
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:51,053
We are wicked to the bearer
of a midnight dream of terror

165
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:55,557
When we're ridin' down
that rocky road to town

166
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:57,559
Seeing we're out
like buckaroos

167
00:17:57,594 --> 00:17:59,561
Let the outlaws
hear the news

168
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:03,565
That the Vigilante men
will ride them down

169
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:08,070
We are wicked to the bearer
of a midnight dream of terror

170
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:12,574
When we're ridin' down
that rocky road to town

171
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:31,593
Get him
to a doctor, men.

172
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:35,597
I'm goin' after them Singin' Riders.
They're camped just outside of town.

173
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:37,599
We'll get this gang.

174
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:01,623
Them fellas seem to be
in a mighty big hurry.

175
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,127
Let's investigate.

176
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:29,651
Black Bart's gang has just robbed
the express. That's them yonder.

177
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:36,658
We'll round the rocks,
boys, and head 'em off.

178
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,464
Did you ever ride the
Buckhorn Trail? No. Never.

179
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:35,467
Did you ever hear of a gang that
did ride it about 12 years ago?

180
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,469
No, never did.

181
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,976
Take these men in and turn 'em
over to the townspeople, Carter,

182
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,980
and see that that stolen money is
returned to the express company.

183
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,493
What news? The Gordon herd
is movin' up the Dalton Trail.

184
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,495
Crossed the Snake River
yesterday.

185
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,498
Should be in Paiute Meadows
in a few days. Well, good.

186
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:11,003
And I'll try and join up with 'em. I
can use a herd like that for outlaw bait.

187
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,506
Now, you'll take the men and wait for
me at the north end of Paiute Meadows.

188
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,509
We'll be pullin' out in
the morning. Good enough.

189
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,013
We just trapped
Black Bart's gang.

190
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:24,016
All right, men.
Herd 'em into town.

191
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:13,815
Howdy.
You Lafe Gordon?

192
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,817
Yes, sir.

193
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:19,321
Who be you? Well, I
might be some help to you.

194
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:23,325
I know this trail backwards. Heard
you were trailin' shorthanded.

195
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:26,328
Thought I might tie up with
you. Where y'all been workin'?

196
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:30,332
Well, the other side of the Snake,
mostly. Rand and Richard's outfit.

197
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:35,337
Trail boss over there. Well,
I can use a good trail boss.

198
00:22:35,372 --> 00:22:38,340
You know this country well, huh?
Yes, sir.

199
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:44,846
What's your name?
Uh, John Allen.

200
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:46,848
You're hired, Allen.

201
00:22:46,883 --> 00:22:51,353
Thirty per and a bonus if there
ain't no losses. Well, thanks, Lafe.

202
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:54,356
How's the herd holdin'
up so far? Pretty good,

203
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:57,359
considerin' the weather.

204
00:22:57,394 --> 00:23:00,862
Well, I reckon I'll drop back and
tell the boys we got a new hand.

205
00:23:00,897 --> 00:23:02,864
Be seein' ya.

206
00:23:11,373 --> 00:23:13,375
Hey, stupid!

207
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:18,380
Where do you think
you're goin'?

208
00:23:18,415 --> 00:23:20,882
Get back there with the
herd, you muttonhead!

209
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:34,896
Just who do you think you're talking
to? And who are you calling "muttonhead"?

210
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:37,399
Well, I, uh-
That is, uh-

211
00:23:37,434 --> 00:23:42,404
- And just what are you doing here,
if I may ask?
- Well, I'm the new trail boss.

212
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:45,907
Well, my name's Mary Gordon,
and my father owns this outfit.

213
00:23:45,942 --> 00:23:49,911
So from now on
it's "Miss Gordon" to you,

214
00:23:49,946 --> 00:23:53,415
not "muttonhead," you-
you dumbbell!

215
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:08,430
Where'd you get
the new maverick, Dad?

216
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:10,932
Just dropped out
of a clear sky.

217
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:13,935
He looks like a good hand
to have around.

218
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,698
Good morning,
Miss Gordon.

219
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:29,701
Oh, good morning,
Mister... Muttonhead.

220
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:31,703
Can I saddle up
for you?

221
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:35,207
Oh, I've been doing it for years.
I guess once more won't hurt me.

222
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,209
Well, that's right.

223
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:40,212
I agree with you. A girl
that rides a trail herd...

224
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:42,214
should be made to do
her own work.

225
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:44,216
There we are.
All ready to go.

226
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:49,221
Any more orders? A good trail boss
always rides at the head of his outfit.

227
00:24:49,256 --> 00:24:51,223
Yes, Miss Gordon.

228
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,756
Well,

229
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:11,760
Plug Lewis just rode in. Said the
Gordon herd's movin' up the Dalton Trail.

230
00:25:11,795 --> 00:25:14,763
That's what I've been waitin' to
hear. Where's the kid? Outside.

231
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:16,765
Blackie, get Jim in here.

232
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,774
- Hey, Jim!
- Well, what is it?

233
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:27,776
Ballard wants
to see ya.

234
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:30,779
What's up?
Don't know.

235
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:32,781
All right.

236
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,300
Well, what is it? The Gordon
herd is out on the flat.

237
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:57,806
I've got 'em as good as sold. Bring 'em
in. Do ya understand? Sure. Don't worry.

238
00:25:57,841 --> 00:26:02,310
Say, I hear that Singin' Rider outfit is making
it plenty hot for the boys down Sonora way.

239
00:26:02,345 --> 00:26:05,313
Keep your eyes open.
I ain't worried none.

240
00:26:05,348 --> 00:26:07,816
Don't be too sure
o' yourself.

241
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:10,819
I hear they're tough-
mighty tough.

242
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:15,323
Ah, forget 'em. I'll take the
boys and figure things out.

243
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,326
Come on, men.

244
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,340
It's funny what a great outlaw
that Wyatt kid turned out to be.

245
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:36,845
Shut up, you fool. Don't ever mention his real
name again. I don't want him to remember it.

246
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,347
He doesn't know yet it was us
that killed his folks.

247
00:26:56,114 --> 00:27:00,118
Early start, Lafe. If it keeps cool,
we oughta cover a lot o' ground.

248
00:27:00,153 --> 00:27:02,120
Yeah, we did
right well yesterday.

249
00:27:02,155 --> 00:27:06,625
That's because
of our new trail boss.

250
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,628
Allen!

251
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,883
Look yonder.

252
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,637
Come on.
Let's go.

253
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,801
Easy, pardner.

254
00:27:32,836 --> 00:27:34,803
There.
What happened?

255
00:27:34,838 --> 00:27:38,306
Held up. They stole my
horse and left me to die.

256
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:41,309
Where'd they get ya?
About five miles backtrail.

257
00:27:41,344 --> 00:27:44,312
I got this far, but couldn't
get much further without a horse.

258
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:48,316
John, have the boys bring the
chuck wagon. We'll fix him up.

259
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:04,332
Guess we'll go through Paiute Meadows
sometime tomorrow, won't we, Allen?

260
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:09,838
About noon, I judge, if it's of any
interest to you. Oh, no. Just wonderin'.

261
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:12,340
I thought you would be.

262
00:28:24,853 --> 00:28:28,857
This Allen fella been
with ya long? No. Why?

263
00:28:28,892 --> 00:28:31,359
Oh, nothin'.

264
00:28:31,394 --> 00:28:33,862
Thought I'd seen him
someplace before.

265
00:28:33,897 --> 00:28:38,366
No, he just joined up with us on
this trip. He's all right. I know.

266
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:41,870
Don't be too sure, Miss Gordon.

267
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,872
Of course,
I ain't accusin' Allen.

268
00:28:43,907 --> 00:28:45,874
But that's an old trick
in trail jumpin'.

269
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:48,877
You put a man with an outfit so's
he steers you right into the trap.

270
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:52,380
But John isn't that kind.

271
00:28:52,415 --> 00:28:55,383
You can't tell, Mary. We
don't know much about him.

272
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:58,386
Your father's right.
You don't know him.

273
00:28:58,421 --> 00:29:01,890
We know him as well as we know you.
Yeah?

274
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:05,393
But I didn't come looking
for a job, did I?

275
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:08,396
Say, maybe
you're right.

276
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:12,400
I'm gonna keep my eye on him anyway.
Good.

277
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:19,774
You're the girl that I loved

278
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:24,779
Long ago

279
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,285
The girl that I held

280
00:29:30,785 --> 00:29:35,790
In my dreams

281
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:40,795
When e'er castles high

282
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:46,301
I built in the sky

283
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:50,805
You were my queen

284
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,810
Of queens

285
00:29:55,845 --> 00:29:58,813
You've the eyes?

286
00:29:58,848 --> 00:30:04,819
The lips
and the hair

287
00:30:04,854 --> 00:30:09,824
Of my girl in my castles

288
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:13,828
Of air

289
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:19,834
Since they've faded away

290
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:25,840
I've been longing each day

291
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:32,347
For the girl that I loved

292
00:30:32,382 --> 00:30:39,354
In my dreams

293
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:42,357
Oh, please
sing it again.

294
00:30:42,392 --> 00:30:44,859
All right, boss.
Anything you say, goes.

295
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:53,868
What's up, Jim?

296
00:30:53,903 --> 00:30:56,371
Boys, we gotta
change our plans.

297
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:59,374
I run into a stranger with the
outfit, and I don't like his looks.

298
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:02,377
But I'll have that herd
at Paiute Meadows by sunup.

299
00:31:02,412 --> 00:31:04,379
Be ready to crack down on 'em.

300
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:07,382
Well, I've gotta get back
so they don't get suspicious.

301
00:31:09,884 --> 00:31:12,887
Well, if you'll excuse me, Mary,
I think I'll hit the hay.

302
00:31:13,388 --> 00:31:15,390
I'm kinda tired.

303
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:18,393
Thanks so much.
I enjoyed your music.

304
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:21,396
Well, good night,
muttonhead.

305
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:23,898
Good night, stupid.

306
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:07,942
Dad, I think you're
wrong about John.

307
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:11,946
Don't worry, Mary.
We'll know better tomorrow.

308
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:12,006
Where's John Allen? Why,
he's turned in for the night.

309
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:14,008
I thought so.
It's a trick.

310
00:33:14,043 --> 00:33:16,010
Ain't he in camp?

311
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:19,013
I can't find him. And his
horse ain't here neither.

312
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:22,517
Just as I figured. Gone to get
his gang. I don't believe it.

313
00:33:22,552 --> 00:33:25,520
Let's drive on tonight.
We can beat him to it.

314
00:33:25,555 --> 00:33:28,523
Why, we can be
in Paiute Meadows by sunup.

315
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:30,525
It's a good idea.

316
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:33,027
Tell the boys
to roll the herd.

317
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:35,530
We're shoving out tonight. Right.

318
00:33:37,532 --> 00:33:40,535
I think you're making
a mistake, Dad.

319
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,537
Just the same, I'm not
taking any chances.

320
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,852
All right, men,
go get 'em!

321
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,703
I got the guy
that plugged you, Lafe.

322
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:30,705
Good work, son.

323
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,207
Take care of 'em, boys!

324
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:12,747
Are you all right?
Yes, thanks to you.

325
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,281
You get 'em all?
Didn't miss a one.

326
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:32,783
Held this fellow for you
and sweated him.

327
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,286
Admits he rode
the Buckhorn Trail.

328
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,790
You used to ride
the Buckhorn Trail, eh?

329
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:43,294
What of it? Do you know who
trail-jumped the Wyatt family?

330
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:46,797
What's it worth to ya?
Plenty, if you know.

331
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:49,300
Just how much?
Your life.

332
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,304
I ain't tellin'.

333
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:05,032
Whit Ballard did it. Whit
Ballard? Well, where's he?

334
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:07,535
I don't know. Don't lie! Where is he?

335
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,543
You'll find him over
in around Grass Valley.

336
00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:19,046
All right, Carter.
You can let this man go.

337
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:24,051
Our bargain is that you clear out of the
country and stay away from Grass Valley.

338
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:26,053
Now, get goin'.

339
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,557
Carter, you take the herd
on into Grass Valley...

340
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,059
and wait for us
at the south end of town.

341
00:38:32,094 --> 00:38:34,061
All right, Cap.

342
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,074
Why didn't you tell us who
you were when you joined us?

343
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:49,577
I didn't see
any reason to tell.

344
00:38:49,612 --> 00:38:53,080
I thought there might be trouble
and I'd lend you a hand.

345
00:38:53,115 --> 00:38:56,584
Oh, I see.
Then you expected trouble.

346
00:38:56,619 --> 00:39:00,087
Well, chasin' outlaws, a fella
can always expect trouble.

347
00:39:00,122 --> 00:39:02,590
Are you in
the government service?

348
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:06,594
No. I- I organized these men
for a personal reason.

349
00:39:06,629 --> 00:39:09,597
Oh, I'm sorry, John. I
didn't mean to be inquisitive.

350
00:39:09,632 --> 00:39:12,600
Oh, that's all right. It's
nothing you shouldn't know.

351
00:39:12,635 --> 00:39:16,103
As a matter of fact, I'd like
to have you know all about me.

352
00:39:16,138 --> 00:39:21,108
For 12 years I've lived with
but one thought in my mind:

353
00:39:21,143 --> 00:39:25,112
to get the men who killed my
parents and stole my younger brother.

354
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,618
If he's still alive,
I'm gonna find him.

355
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,622
Come on, boy!

356
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,638
Dad, you're wounded!

357
00:39:50,673 --> 00:39:52,640
Just a little nip
in the shoulder.

358
00:39:52,675 --> 00:39:57,645
But if it hadn't been for Jim here, they'd
have got me sure. Oh, I did the best I could.

359
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,148
Those Singin' Riders
really took care of things.

360
00:40:01,183 --> 00:40:04,151
I'm sorry, Jim. I guess
I had you figured wrong.

361
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:09,156
That's all right. We all make mistakes.
And I sure was wrong about you.

362
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,660
It's lucky John's men
got here in time to save us.

363
00:40:12,695 --> 00:40:16,664
-Did you find out who jumped us?
-They've all been taken care of.

364
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:20,167
I told Carter to take the herd
on into Grass Valley for you,

365
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,670
and I think we'd better
get you to a doctor.

366
00:40:22,705 --> 00:40:25,673
Well, folks, if you don't mind,
I'll be pullin' stakes.

367
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:29,677
It's only 20 miles to Grass Valley, and
I'd like to get there as soon as possible.

368
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,681
That's all right, son. I want to
thank you for the help you give us.

369
00:40:33,716 --> 00:40:35,683
Just keep the horse
you been usin'.

370
00:40:35,718 --> 00:40:39,687
When you get to Grass Valley, leave him
in the livery stable and we'll pick him up.

371
00:40:39,722 --> 00:40:42,189
Well, folks, I'll
be seein' you all later.

372
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,951
I told you to watch out for
that Singing Riders crowd.

373
00:40:53,986 --> 00:40:58,456
But you wouldn't listen to me.
You were too sure of yourself.

374
00:40:58,491 --> 00:41:00,958
No, I wasn't.
We were outnumbered five to one.

375
00:41:00,993 --> 00:41:02,960
You couldn't have done
any better yourself.

376
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,464
They got all our boys
except you and Red.

377
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:08,466
How'd he get away?

378
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:11,469
Outfigured 'em, he said.
Well, I'm tellin' you one thing.

379
00:41:11,504 --> 00:41:15,473
You ain't gonna be able to do anything with
those Singin' Riders outfit hangin' around.

380
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:17,475
They sure ruined that job.

381
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,005
Ah, forget it.

382
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,508
You can't cash
on somethin' you ain't got.

383
00:41:50,543 --> 00:41:55,012
Now, listen to this. There's over
$60,000 in gold in the Commercial Bank.

384
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,015
Brought in last night
from that Big Creek strike.

385
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:02,019
I was waitin' for you and the boys
to come back before I pulled the job,

386
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,022
but I had to go get Dugan
and his gang to help us out.

387
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:09,527
Well, you'd better strike quick and clear
out. Those Singin' Riders are headed this way.

388
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,535
While the doctor's taking care of your
father, I'll mosey on down the street.

389
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,538
There's someone I want to
see. We'll wait here for you.

390
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,069
Is, uh, Ballard around?

391
00:42:52,104 --> 00:42:56,073
No, he's not. He drops in
every once in a while.

392
00:42:56,108 --> 00:42:58,075
Thanks.

393
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,081
Ed.

394
00:43:24,637 --> 00:43:26,604
Come in.

395
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,108
What's up, Hank?

396
00:43:31,143 --> 00:43:33,611
There's a fellow downstairs
lookin' for you.

397
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:36,614
Yeah? Who is he?
Hisrealname is Wyatt.

398
00:43:36,649 --> 00:43:40,117
Wyatt?
You remember, Ballard.

399
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,120
- What do you mean?
- Oh, nothin' much.

400
00:43:43,155 --> 00:43:46,123
Only when I was travelin'
with the Cummings gang,

401
00:43:46,158 --> 00:43:49,627
it was Wyatt and his
Singin' Riders that broke us up.

402
00:43:49,662 --> 00:43:54,131
He was lookin' for you then.
Seems that he's out to get you.

403
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:56,133
He's here now.

404
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,639
Jim, Hank says that Singin'
Rider fella's downstairs.

405
00:44:01,674 --> 00:44:03,641
Where?
At the bar.

406
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,651
That's him all right.

407
00:44:13,686 --> 00:44:16,654
Lucky thing I didn't go
downstairs. He thinks I'm a friend.

408
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,165
Wait a minute, partner.

409
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,168
You've forgotten something,
haven't you? What do you mean?

410
00:44:31,203 --> 00:44:34,672
Our bargain was that
you stay clear of Grass Valley.

411
00:44:34,707 --> 00:44:37,174
Besides bein' a thief,
you're a liar.

412
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,185
Listen, Hank. You go down and get the
boys and handle him any way you can.

413
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,688
But handle him!

414
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,202
Don't shoot, Jim. There's
too many townsmen there.

415
00:45:05,237 --> 00:45:07,204
Besides, you might
get one of our own men.

416
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,344
Why, he's just like a wildcat.
Look at him go!

417
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:42,873
He's in here, Ballard!
Break that door down!

418
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:55,886
He's got out the window! You better
stop him before he gets to his men!

419
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,888
Come on!

420
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,365
He went that way!

421
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,244
Wait a minute, men.

422
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:31,255
Have you seen John?
Yes. Uh-

423
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,258
Why, he's upstairs. He's
just been hurt in a fight.

424
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:36,760
Hurt?
I'll take you to him.

425
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:24,057
What's the idea?
Who's the girl?

426
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:27,561
Wait a minute. That's Gordon's
daughter. I got a swell idea.

427
00:47:27,596 --> 00:47:29,563
What's the girl
got to do with it?

428
00:47:29,598 --> 00:47:33,567
We'll never stop Allen from getting to
his men now. But with her here, we can.

429
00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:35,569
I'll show you.

430
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:52,085
Come on, boys!

431
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,603
This note will hold off Allen's riders
and bring him right into our hands.

432
00:48:09,638 --> 00:48:12,105
Send some of the boys
to Blind Canyon.

433
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,108
When they finish with him, tell 'em to
come back and meet us at Wild Horse Corral.

434
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:19,112
Get the rest of the boys ready to clean
out the bank as soon as I get back.

435
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:22,616
Get the rest of the Dugan
gang ready and the wagon quick.

436
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:24,618
Let's go.

437
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:48,141
Hurry up, man.
Get that wagon.

438
00:48:51,645 --> 00:48:53,647
All right, boys.
Get mounted.

439
00:49:00,654 --> 00:49:05,158
You're pretty smart, Ballard. You
let him play right into your hand.

440
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:07,160
I get it.
Brother against brother.

441
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:10,664
Forget about that brother stuff.
You don't know about it, see?

442
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:13,667
Go out and get the boys.
We're movin' right away.

443
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:16,670
What about Jim? Well,
Jim's served his purpose.

444
00:49:16,705 --> 00:49:20,641
When he's found out about his
brother, it'll be just too bad.

445
00:49:20,676 --> 00:49:23,143
The Singin' Riders will
take care of him anyway.

446
00:49:23,178 --> 00:49:26,146
Besides, it's one less cut on the gold.

447
00:49:26,181 --> 00:49:28,649
Now, get goin'.

448
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,933
You men get ready
to cover the town.

449
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:30,460
Rode out to get you, Allen. Just learned
that Ballard's gang are holding Mary.

450
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:32,462
They sent this note.

451
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:39,970
"Allen, I'm holding Gordon's girl,
and we've got a deal to make you.

452
00:50:40,005 --> 00:50:44,975
"Leave your riders and come to Blind
Canyon alone if you want us to release her.

453
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,977
Ballard."

454
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:52,983
Carter, I'm goin'
in there alone.

455
00:50:53,018 --> 00:50:54,985
You keep the men here.

456
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,488
If I'm not back in a half
an hour, come and get me.

457
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:13,196
It was the Ballard outfit.
They got all the gold.

458
00:52:13,231 --> 00:52:16,700
We oughta hang every one of 'em. Have
you sent out to the mine for help?

459
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,202
I'll go right now.
I'll go with you.

460
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:22,205
Let's get the gang together
and we'll all go.

461
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,582
Where's Ballard? I
don't know. They've gone.

462
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,585
And they've tricked you into
double-crossing your own brother.

463
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,587
What do you mean?
John Allen is your brother.

464
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,590
John Allen's my brother?
Yes.

465
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:43,593
His real name is John Wyatt,
and you're Jim Wyatt.

466
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:46,096
I overheard Ballard tell Red
while I was in the closet.

467
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:49,599
John's been looking for you ever
since they wiped out your family.

468
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,102
You've got to save him.

469
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,080
Look out, John!

470
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,475
They've trapped John
in Blind Canyon.

471
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,477
Come on.

472
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:59,996
Thanks, Jim.
Where's Mary?

473
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:02,999
She's safe. She's gone to get
your riders. What do you mean?

474
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:06,503
I framed you, John. I sent you
in to this, and I'll get you out,

475
00:55:06,538 --> 00:55:09,506
'cause... you're my brother. Brother?

476
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:13,009
Yes. Mary told me everything. She
overheard Red and Ballard's conversation.

477
00:55:13,044 --> 00:55:16,012
Ballard wanted you killed
so that I'd never know.

478
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:18,014
Jim.

479
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:20,517
We've gotta get
Ballard, Jim.

480
00:55:20,552 --> 00:55:24,020
Their horses are in back of us. I'll
hold them off while you make a run for it.

481
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,523
It's your only chance.
What's your chance?

482
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:29,025
Oh, never mind me.
We'll both run for it.

483
00:57:26,392 --> 00:57:28,895
That's Ballard in the wagon.

484
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,104
Hyah, hyah, hyah, hyah!

485
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:21,140
Jim!

486
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,644
Did you get Ballard, John?

487
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:27,647
Everything's squared.

488
00:59:27,682 --> 00:59:30,650
Guess I ain't
gonna make it, John.

489
00:59:30,685 --> 00:59:33,653
You won't hold it
against me, will ya?

490
00:59:33,688 --> 00:59:35,655
No, Jim.

491
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:41,160
Funny. I always wanted
to be a bad man,

492
00:59:41,195 --> 00:59:43,162
even when we were kids.

493
00:59:43,197 --> 00:59:45,164
Do you remember?

494
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:50,670
I, I guess I'm gettin'
what I deserve.

495
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:08,554
Over the prairies

496
01:00:09,055 --> 01:00:12,058
To home?

497
01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:18,564
Covered wagon

498
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:24,070
Rolling westward ho? I'm leaving
