1
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,955
Come here.

2
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:41,793
Mr. Tunstall!

3
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,709
Put that down, Tom. Put down your gun.

4
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,881
Now, lad, put down your hands.

5
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,279
Put them down.

6
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,564
Do you belong to Mr. Morton?

7
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,623
Are you one of Morton's men?

8
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,295
What's your name?

9
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,966
Say your name, boy.

10
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,841
- The name's William Bonney.
- What happened to your horse?

11
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,212
Sickness.

12
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,451
Where are you from?

13
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,187
- Up north.
- From Lincoln?

14
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,254
- Denver?
- Kansas City.

15
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,027
You're a long way from home.

16
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,663
What do you want?

17
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,266
- Work.
- Are you hungry?

18
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,403
I can do with a man.

19
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,338
I pay a dollar a day and meals.

20
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,641
- Give him the blue mare, Tom.
- The blue mare?

21
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,747
Mr. Tunstall...

22
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,281
...how do we know he
ain't one of Morton's?

23
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,778
He said no.

24
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,583
How do we know he ain't a liar?

25
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,360
Mr. McSween?

26
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,255
Well, he says he wants work.

27
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,193
He's with us till he
shows he's against us.

28
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,732
Tom will take you to the men...

29
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,370
...give you a canteen and
assign you to a quarter boss.

30
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,665
- See that he gets the blue mare, Tom.
- Yes, sir.

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,865
We'll make camp here.

32
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,236
Her name's Buster.

33
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:37,247
Ain't much of a name for a female
but it's all we could think up.

34
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,884
Hey, Charley.

35
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,544
Charley, this here is...
What did you call yourself?

36
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,246
- William Bonney.
- William Bonney.

37
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,915
This is Charley Boudre,
and I'm Thomas Folliard.

38
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,618
- Yo, William.
- We best call you Billy for short.

39
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,024
Well, make up your mind.

40
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,188
I just got myself all
set to call him William.

41
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,800
- My name's Tom.
- Tom?

42
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,563
Ain't that a dumb name.

43
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,964
You old blue-lady dog, you.

44
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,700
She aims to turn around and bite
you in the fat part of your leg...

45
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,711
...so you gotta kick her in
the jaw some, make her mind.

46
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:12,373
I'll say one thing, she don't
take sass from them bonehead bulls.

47
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,952
You feed her and give her
a kiss every now and then...

48
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,248
...she'll love you for life.

49
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,224
He don't exactly talk your head off.

50
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,362
Hey, Charley, did you notice
the way he strapped his gun?

51
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:31,764
Low?

52
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,930
Yeah. Ties her down too.

53
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,376
That don't mean he's a bandit.

54
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,240
Well, it don't mean
he's a preacher neither.

55
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,277
You like him?

56
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,719
William.

57
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,549
Yes, sir. I know him from El Paso.

58
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,154
His pa run off and
deserted the kid and his ma.

59
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,299
Kid got himself in
some real bad trouble.

60
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,367
Street drunk said a word against
his ma, and the kid stabbed him.

61
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,262
Killed him.

62
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,300
- Killed him?
- Yes, sir.

63
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,840
Of course, it was a long time back.

64
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,568
Folks talked a lot about the kid...

65
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,236
...being an 11 -years-old
child and committing a murder.

66
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,812
Well, he says he's from Kansas City.

67
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,751
No, sir. El Paso. William Bonney.

68
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,321
Tom.

69
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,866
That Mr. Tunstall,
is he an Englishman?

70
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,626
That's what they say.

71
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,771
I can't hardly understand
the way he talks.

72
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,429
He hails from Ayrshire.

73
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,837
From Ayrshire?

74
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,046
Sure come a long way to push beef.

75
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:51,014
He's the only small
rancher hardheaded enough...

76
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,152
...to push a herd into Lincoln.

77
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,186
- He expect trouble?
- Maybe.

78
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,958
He sure don't think
much of a gun, does he?

79
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,027
No, he's funny about that.

80
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,893
He thinks the only way to avoid
gun trouble is to go without.

81
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,538
The Englishman is bringing
his herd into Lincoln.

82
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,447
He undercuts our price to the Army...

83
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,953
...every stockman with six
cows will come driving in.

84
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,856
Well, we'll stop him.

85
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,994
Drive his heard along the
hills and join onto ours.

86
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,221
This Englishman don't stop easy.

87
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,195
You got a badge, Sheriff Brady.

88
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,664
- Arrest him?
- Unauthorized trespass.

89
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,803
Lock him up. Confiscate his herd.

90
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,269
- Right, Hill?
- You got the right to arrest him.

91
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,965
- But he's a long ways out.
- Well, meet him.

92
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,271
When he gets to Valley
Pass, you'll arrest him.

93
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,982
Hey, Hill.

94
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,835
Probably camp down there tonight.

95
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,111
Early in the morning,
that English fellow...

96
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,873
...come through the pass
on the way to Lincoln.

97
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,882
We'll sit here and wait for him.

98
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:37,217
Yes, sir, they'll be strung
out down there for a mile.

99
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,212
<i>- It's Gitanos.
- What?</i>

100
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,740
<i>It's Gitanos. That's the
Mexican word for "Gypsy."</i>

101
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,646
Well, Gypsy comes from Arabia, Egypt.

102
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,585
Well, they come from Mexico.

103
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:13,691
Mexico, Spain, Hungary.
All over the world.

104
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,020
Mexico.

105
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,756
Mexico.

106
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,058
Do you speak Spanish?

107
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,398
I picked it up.

108
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,869
Not in Kansas City?

109
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,445
No, I lived south.

110
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,111
Them Gypsies, they's on
their way down to Madero.

111
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,017
- For Pascuas.
- Pascuas?

112
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,657
Yeah, it's a religious week.

113
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,419
The Mexican people build
a man out of straw...

114
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:52,724
...and then they set fire
to him, they burn him up.

115
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,398
All those ashes blow away.

116
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,592
Why do they do that?

117
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,465
Well, do you want something?

118
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,025
- You reading in that book?
- Aye.

119
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,331
Do you know this book?

120
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,942
Well, it ain't the Bible.

121
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,814
When you read you don't
speak out the words.

122
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,816
Either way.

123
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,886
Are you interested in reading?

124
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,656
Oh, why, it's not so hard.

125
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,952
I could teach you to read.

126
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:57,993
Hey, see here.

127
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,632
Now, you see this black print here?

128
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,566
"Through a glass darkly."

129
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,237
Through a glass darkly?

130
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,810
That's a quote from the Bible.

131
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,811
Can't get away from the Bible.

132
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,473
Do you know the Bible well?

133
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,848
- My ma.
- Your mother read it to you?

134
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,612
Well, she knew parts of it.

135
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,484
See, now what does that mean?

136
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,592
I mean, for sure.

137
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,320
Through a glass darkly?

138
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,021
You might say it's the
way some people see things.

139
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,190
Like looking through a
piece of colored glass.

140
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,893
All dark and twisted up.

141
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,039
- Like a whiskey bottle?
- Aye.

142
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,575
Or it might mean a mystery.

143
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,976
Or something you see that
you can't quite make out.

144
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,644
- An enemy.
- Or a friend.

145
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,755
You can take this book if you like.

146
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,153
I have to ride on into
Lincoln in the morning...

147
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,193
...so I won't be needing it.

148
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,955
Do you want a rider to come with you?

149
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,293
No, I don't want an
armed man, William.

150
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,799
Why don't you take the book.

151
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,672
I might look over some words.

152
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,971
- Everything all right, William?
- You gonna ride in, Mr. Tunstall?

153
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,612
Aye, I have to set a price
for the Army quartermaster...

154
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,714
...before we bring in the herd.

155
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,818
- I thought I heard something.
- Where?

156
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,977
I don't know. Out there.

157
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,885
I have to ride in, Billy.

158
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,054
I'll go with you. You need a gun.

159
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,892
No, I don't want you.

160
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:56,524
Front and back.

161
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,601
Guess we should take him into Lincoln.

162
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:06,208
His horse is dead.

163
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:07,776
Put him over my horse.

164
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,012
No.

165
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:11,773
Mine.

166
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:31,920
It's past midnight.

167
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,026
Billy can stay in the side room.

168
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:35,460
I'll stay here.

169
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:46,268
He liked you, Billy.

170
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:49,575
Said you had a good mind.

171
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:52,474
Said you were quick.

172
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,082
Asked good questions.

173
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:58,446
He gave me this. See?

174
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:01,722
"Corinthians."

175
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:10,057
I can't read.

176
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:28,675
Lord God...

177
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:31,777
...this was a quiet man.

178
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:34,985
He lived the way a man ought to live.

179
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,787
He did not lie.

180
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:41,656
He did not hurt.

181
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,460
He listened to any
man who spoke to him.

182
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:46,364
I told him.

183
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:49,233
I told him I heard something.

184
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:53,534
He had to go to Lincoln.

185
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:59,610
Mr. McSween, I gotta do something.

186
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:01,874
You'll find work.

187
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:04,953
No, not work. Something...

188
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,989
It's not your place.

189
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,618
I got to...

190
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:16,296
You're not his kin.

191
00:17:17,668 --> 00:17:20,660
- You didn't know him.
- I knew him.

192
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:22,430
Nobody did.

193
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:26,098
Not close. Not even me.

194
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,641
- I knew him.
- He was a man to himself.

195
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,977
Billy.

196
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:39,322
Billy, you can stay with me.

197
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,315
I'll be bringing in the herds.

198
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,328
Listen, Billy.

199
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:47,555
Listen to me.

200
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:51,835
The other way is against God.

201
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:04,011
When I was a child,
I spoke as a child.

202
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:08,515
I understood as a child.
I thought as a child.

203
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:16,390
But when I became a man,
I put away childish things.

204
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:20,388
For now, he sees
through a glass darkly...

205
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,997
...but then, face to
face, now I know in part...

206
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:32,109
...but then shall I know
even as also I am known.

207
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:52,058
Go! Get up there!

208
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:54,026
Get up there!

209
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:19,389
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Got no sorrows!

210
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:20,853
Your worked for Mr. Tunstall.

211
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:23,390
- No sorrows.
- Nice funeral.

212
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,427
There, keep it coming. One for
the machine and one for a drink.

213
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:27,825
One there, one here.

214
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:30,899
Mr. Bonney, you can
depend on Mr. Moultrie.

215
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:39,173
Mr. Bonney.

216
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:42,039
I want you to know how sorry I
feel about your late employer.

217
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:44,772
He was a gentleman. We had
men like him in the South.

218
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:47,075
I didn't fight in the war.

219
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:48,684
I was sickly.

220
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:52,879
Keep it coming. I want
to hear it up in my room.

221
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:01,564
- How far to Madero?
- One night.

222
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:03,324
- State your name.
- Garrett.

223
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,459
- How's that?
- Garrett. Pat Garrett.

224
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:10,933
Bonney.

225
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:18,740
Little case of the quick jump.

226
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:22,984
Somebody gonna get
his head clipped off.

227
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,324
Garrett. Pat Garrett.

228
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:31,456
- Who's he?
- William Bonney.

229
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:33,186
One of the Tunstall boys.

230
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:36,821
- You'd think they'd have more respect.
- Respect?

231
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,730
Mr. Tunstall was laid
to rest this morning.

232
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:41,894
Cut that thing off!

233
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:44,063
Rally around the flag!

234
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:48,207
Tie me down!

235
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:56,281
- Rally around the flag!
- Rally around the flag!

236
00:20:59,623 --> 00:21:03,150
Oh, man, you really
took a bite out of me.

237
00:21:05,596 --> 00:21:07,587
Draw a woman.

238
00:21:16,006 --> 00:21:18,372
At that funeral, I listened.

239
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:25,012
I heard flies on the window pane,
and then I heard voices mumbling.

240
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:29,410
Brady and Morton.

241
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:33,087
I got all four names.

242
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:37,557
You don't know?

243
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:39,195
I know.

244
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:43,800
Sheriff Brady, Mr.
Morton, Moon and Hill.

245
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:46,794
The sheriff?

246
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:50,199
- You can't.
- I can.

247
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:52,871
You can't shoot a sheriff.

248
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:55,705
- They call in the U.S. Marshal.
- They hang you.

249
00:21:56,213 --> 00:21:58,181
They shot Mr. Tunstall,
nobody hangs them.

250
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:01,283
Oh, I don't want to.

251
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:07,879
You go. Go on. Blow their
heads off, I don't...

252
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:12,089
I got me some money. I got a
belly. I wanna go to Madero.

253
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:14,157
Now.

254
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:16,162
Charley, Mr. Tunstall was your friend.

255
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,164
- He was my boss.
- Tom?

256
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:21,237
He was my friend.

257
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:23,497
But he hardly said more
than 10 words to you.

258
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:25,539
He gave you that book
that you always read.

259
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:27,643
I read it. I can read.

260
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:30,905
I know that. But
that's all he gave you.

261
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:32,946
No, we belong to him.

262
00:22:33,116 --> 00:22:34,708
He paid our wages.

263
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:37,854
Wages don't make it right
to go out and kill for a man.

264
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:40,080
Go to the law.

265
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:42,489
Go to Brady?

266
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,652
Go to Sheriff Brady?

267
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:47,826
- You ain't the law.
- Now I am.

268
00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:51,627
They used their law to keep
Mr. Tunstall's herd out.

269
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:54,327
They shot him down blind.

270
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:57,369
- Charley?
- No.

271
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,805
It's still murder.

272
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:02,843
- It's against the Bible.
- No.

273
00:23:03,013 --> 00:23:04,446
They did the murder.

274
00:23:05,048 --> 00:23:07,243
- Now, wait...
- Mr. Tunstall was unarmed.

275
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:09,442
Never carried a gun.

276
00:23:11,788 --> 00:23:13,449
That's right.

277
00:23:13,623 --> 00:23:15,352
Murder.

278
00:23:17,627 --> 00:23:19,288
Charley?

279
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:23,365
No, sir.

280
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:26,028
No, sir.

281
00:23:27,037 --> 00:23:28,265
You gonna let them go free?

282
00:23:35,178 --> 00:23:37,078
Ought not to.

283
00:23:38,782 --> 00:23:41,683
No, sir. Ought not to.

284
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:51,490
Here's the sheriff's office.

285
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:57,790
Brady and Morton
gonna ride down here...

286
00:23:57,968 --> 00:24:00,095
...to check the prisoners.

287
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:05,308
There's McSween's house over there.

288
00:24:06,843 --> 00:24:10,904
We wait here and here.

289
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:15,645
When they get there, we stop them...

290
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:17,787
You there, get back!

291
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:20,115
Get back.

292
00:24:20,323 --> 00:24:21,915
Brady.

293
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:24,487
I know you. And you too, Morton.

294
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:26,253
You killed Tunstall.

295
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:29,660
You sat up there in the
rocks and you murdered him.

296
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:32,397
Well, I'm calling you, you hear me?

297
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:36,862
You been called.

298
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,684
Throw that away. What
did you touch him for?

299
00:24:49,852 --> 00:24:52,480
Get Bucky. Ride out to the
herd. Get Bucky and tell the men.

300
00:24:52,655 --> 00:24:54,520
- Come with me, Billy.
- I gotta get McSween.

301
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,679
Come on. Go.

302
00:25:01,764 --> 00:25:03,994
I saw that kid from that
hotel and Tom Folliard.

303
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:06,499
- Where? How many of them?
- More was behind the fence!

304
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:09,103
Tunstall's men. They must
be holed out at McSween's.

305
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:11,740
They gotta be at McSween's.
We'll get every one of them.

306
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:13,842
Don't kill the sheriff
and get away with it!

307
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,774
They're all holed up at
McSween's! Let's burn them out!

308
00:25:16,946 --> 00:25:18,811
- Burn them out!
- Everybody get a torch.

309
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:20,312
We'll burn them out.

310
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:24,385
William, Hill, get some
more men on the way.

311
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:35,295
- Come on, burn them out.
- Where's McSween?

312
00:25:36,065 --> 00:25:38,499
- Where's McSween?
- He's in the house.

313
00:25:39,635 --> 00:25:41,796
- Come on, burn them out!
- Burn them out!

314
00:25:41,971 --> 00:25:43,336
Burn them out!

315
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:44,767
- McSween.
- What's wrong?

316
00:25:44,941 --> 00:25:46,408
- Get out of here.
- What happened?

317
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:47,873
They're coming here after us.

318
00:25:48,044 --> 00:25:49,443
- Brady, I shot him.
- Shot Brady?

319
00:25:49,612 --> 00:25:51,443
- And Morton. Got them both.
- Killed them?

320
00:25:51,614 --> 00:25:53,241
You murdered them!

321
00:25:55,084 --> 00:25:56,676
Get back!

322
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:15,561
- Get down! Get out of here!
- Get away from me!

323
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:17,729
Get away!

324
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,471
The piano!

325
00:26:23,946 --> 00:26:27,313
The piano. Her piano. My wife.

326
00:26:27,483 --> 00:26:30,008
- Go! Get out!
- Leave me be!

327
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,614
My wife! My wife!

328
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,384
Ben! Ben!

329
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,528
Oh, God, Ben.

330
00:26:41,197 --> 00:26:44,257
Ben. Ben.

331
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:52,074
What are you doing? Let go of me!

332
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:54,298
Let go!

333
00:26:56,145 --> 00:26:59,945
Ben! Ben! Ben!

334
00:27:09,992 --> 00:27:12,552
Help me! Ben!

335
00:27:20,136 --> 00:27:22,604
I'm sorry. Oh, God.

336
00:27:22,772 --> 00:27:25,832
Oh, Ben. Ben, I'm sorry!

337
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:38,483
Where's the law?

338
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:40,713
Oh, Ben.

339
00:28:21,897 --> 00:28:23,626
McSween?

340
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:26,632
- The boy?
- The floor caved in.

341
00:28:48,157 --> 00:28:49,283
Hey, Billy.

342
00:28:50,593 --> 00:28:54,154
Bucky wouldn't come.
He wouldn't listen.

343
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,793
None of them.

344
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:15,544
Your arm.

345
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:17,845
McSween's house.

346
00:29:19,522 --> 00:29:22,150
I got some clothes in my pack roll.

347
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,286
I got two of them. I got two of them.

348
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:28,021
You lay still, now. I'll get
some grease for that burn.

349
00:29:28,197 --> 00:29:30,358
Don't touch it, now.
It's stuck to your...

350
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:32,398
Stuck to your arm.

351
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:36,403
We got two of them.
We got two of them.

352
00:29:36,572 --> 00:29:38,563
Just lay still.

353
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:42,837
We'll hide out for a couple of days, then
we'll head north for the farm country.

354
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:47,011
No. Get me to Saval.

355
00:29:47,183 --> 00:29:49,583
- Who?
- Saval. He's a gunsmith down in Madero.

356
00:29:49,752 --> 00:29:53,244
Charley's down in Madero.
I'll take you to Madero.

357
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:12,830
Garrett. Pat Garrett.

358
00:30:13,008 --> 00:30:14,498
Bonney.

359
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:20,208
- Looks like you got nine lives.
- Got eight left.

360
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:22,509
You're hurt bad. Come on,
let me give you a hand.

361
00:30:22,685 --> 00:30:24,414
- No, you get me to Saval.
- The gunsmith.

362
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:26,452
- We got a doctor.
- He don't want no doctor.

363
00:30:26,622 --> 00:30:29,386
- He just wants Saval.
- I saw his wife around here a while ago.

364
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:31,788
- Celsa?
- Yeah, come on.

365
00:30:43,372 --> 00:30:44,999
Saval.

366
00:30:49,144 --> 00:30:51,476
Billy. Billy.

367
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:54,980
Your arm, your neck. What happened?

368
00:30:56,285 --> 00:30:58,219
Celsa! Celsa!

369
00:30:58,387 --> 00:31:00,116
Celsa! Celsa!

370
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:01,517
Celsa, come here.

371
00:31:04,426 --> 00:31:05,984
Billy!

372
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:08,095
Be careful. His arm.

373
00:31:08,264 --> 00:31:11,097
Look at him. Hey.

374
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:13,735
- Watch his arm.
- Easy, easy, easy.

375
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:19,199
You find Charley and get you a room.

376
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,434
You can stay at my place.

377
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,407
Let's go.

378
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:32,951
You don't kill a sheriff.

379
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,887
- You see anybody?
- Not yet.

380
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,655
You best keep him out of sight.

381
00:31:41,797 --> 00:31:43,287
Best.

382
00:31:55,778 --> 00:31:57,473
Two years, he run away.

383
00:31:57,646 --> 00:31:59,011
Do you see his eyes?

384
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:01,445
He's old in two years.

385
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,750
He's in a bad way.

386
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,080
Run away, run back.

387
00:32:06,255 --> 00:32:09,383
Sew his clothes, give
him food, he's gone again.

388
00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:15,662
Look, his shirt is all burned.

389
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:18,591
I tried to take his gun belt.

390
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:19,995
He grabbed my hand.

391
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:22,399
It's under his pillow.

392
00:32:22,938 --> 00:32:26,465
It's the same as
before, wherever he goes.

393
00:32:26,642 --> 00:32:29,406
- What?
- Pain.

394
00:32:31,847 --> 00:32:35,339
This here's Charley Boudre.
He's a friend of Billy's.

395
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:37,719
This lady takes care of Bill.

396
00:32:37,886 --> 00:32:40,821
- Is he bad off?
- Well, he sleeps a lot.

397
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,753
Could we come in?

398
00:32:42,925 --> 00:32:45,485
- lf you don't stay too long.
- Oh, we won't.

399
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:50,758
Hey, Billy?

400
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:53,330
Hey, Tom.

401
00:32:54,136 --> 00:32:56,229
Look what crawled out
from underneath a rock.

402
00:32:56,405 --> 00:32:57,838
What?

403
00:32:58,007 --> 00:33:00,134
Hey, Charley, you old
horse's blanket. Come here.

404
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:03,210
Why, it's that poor boy
that got hisself killed.

405
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:07,076
Newspapers said that poor outlaw
youth was fried to a grease spot.

406
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:10,218
I'd like to lay this little
offering on that poor soul's grave.

407
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:11,876
Wait, what is that?

408
00:33:12,054 --> 00:33:14,614
A little friend to keep him company.

409
00:33:16,492 --> 00:33:18,289
A horny toad.

410
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:23,227
Oh, what a weeping shame
to die so young and so fair.

411
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:27,399
Why, the whole town of Lincoln
is draped in solid black.

412
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:29,503
All them red-eyed widow women...

413
00:33:29,672 --> 00:33:32,869
...is weeping and throwing
their selves off the roofs.

414
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:34,339
The sight, I tell you.

415
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,478
- Oh, you'd say.
- Hold on, Tom.

416
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:38,670
Tom, my heart is near broke.

417
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:42,044
- Best thing we sing a little hymn.
- I reckon.

418
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:44,879
<i>A flock of angels</i>

419
00:33:45,054 --> 00:33:49,684
<i>Shall fly him up to heaven</i>

420
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:52,884
Stop it now. Stop it! Stop it!

421
00:33:55,964 --> 00:33:58,194
I reckon we better go now.

422
00:33:58,367 --> 00:33:59,857
Hey, Billy.

423
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:04,633
Need anything, we'll be hanging
around outside in the street.

424
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:10,277
We'll come back tomorrow
and put some flowers on him.

425
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:41,438
Hey, did the governor ever figure
out how to stop this cattle war?

426
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,807
You ask me, I'd string
them all up to a tree.

427
00:34:48,684 --> 00:34:52,176
That boy I saw across the street
carrying his arm stiff by his side...

428
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:54,322
...does he live around here?

429
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,654
- Not as I know.
- Who is he?

430
00:34:57,826 --> 00:34:59,657
I don't know, Joe.

431
00:35:00,195 --> 00:35:01,753
You coming to Pete Maxwell's party?

432
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,660
- I seen you talking to him.
- Let you meet my girl.

433
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:08,092
You see why I work up a sweat...

434
00:35:08,637 --> 00:35:10,798
...and mind my business.

435
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,111
Hello, Pat.

436
00:35:20,682 --> 00:35:22,513
You don't wanna sit out here.

437
00:35:24,453 --> 00:35:25,784
The sun eases my arm.

438
00:35:25,954 --> 00:35:27,581
Yeah, I know.

439
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:33,524
But somebody not from here,
some peddler passing through...

440
00:35:33,695 --> 00:35:37,028
...he'll go right back to Lincoln
and tell them you're still around.

441
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:38,826
No, ain't nobody bothers me.

442
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:41,834
Look, Billy, you gotta keep down.

443
00:35:42,638 --> 00:35:44,265
I know.

444
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,969
I hid.

445
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:49,305
I was a kid.

446
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:51,841
I hid half my life.

447
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:56,716
You just gotta dig a
deep hole and get in.

448
00:35:57,186 --> 00:35:58,778
I mean it.

449
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:02,456
Now, how come you care so
big about me, Pat Garrett?

450
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:07,160
I guess I'm just naturally
soft-hearted, Billy.

451
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:15,262
Be careful.

452
00:36:16,705 --> 00:36:19,196
Hey, Pat, when's the wedding?

453
00:36:19,374 --> 00:36:20,466
Sunday, a week.

454
00:36:21,476 --> 00:36:22,875
You be careful.

455
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:47,661
Hey, Billy.

456
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,231
Soldiers.

457
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:59,109
Get out there, see what they want.

458
00:37:00,616 --> 00:37:03,608
Hey, Tom, Tom, we gonna clean up.

459
00:37:16,131 --> 00:37:17,393
Hey, Billy.

460
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:21,161
Hey, Celsa, come out here.

461
00:37:22,204 --> 00:37:23,569
Look at this.

462
00:37:24,106 --> 00:37:25,095
Amnesty.

463
00:37:33,614 --> 00:37:35,013
What do you make out of it?

464
00:37:35,182 --> 00:37:38,982
Sergeant says it's the general's orders.
He's the new governor of the territory.

465
00:37:39,153 --> 00:37:41,519
"General Lew Wallace, governor."

466
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:43,350
Governor, I saw that.

467
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:46,725
Well, that must mean us too.

468
00:37:50,531 --> 00:37:52,465
How do you figure?

469
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:55,128
Well, amnesty.

470
00:37:56,036 --> 00:38:00,871
Nobody gets hung, nobody goes to jail.
We're all forgived for our sins, man.

471
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:03,236
We can stay here.

472
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,401
We is forgived for
shooting Brady and Morton?

473
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:08,013
It must mean us.

474
00:38:08,482 --> 00:38:09,744
Boy, you believe that?

475
00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:13,580
Well, it's one way to settle a fight.
Now both sides lay down their guns.

476
00:38:13,754 --> 00:38:15,016
Well, that's the order.

477
00:38:15,189 --> 00:38:17,783
All is forgiven, provided
you don't break the peace.

478
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:20,256
If you do, the general
will break your head.

479
00:38:20,427 --> 00:38:21,655
You don't have to hide.

480
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:24,525
No hiding, no running!
We can stay here.

481
00:38:24,698 --> 00:38:26,165
You can stay here. You stay here.

482
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:27,766
Yes, sir, we're gonna stay here.

483
00:38:27,935 --> 00:38:30,403
- We're gonna kick up some dust.
- Now, come on, quit now.

484
00:38:31,372 --> 00:38:34,398
- That's $4, boy.
- Pig's foot.

485
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:36,202
Pay the man $4.

486
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:38,174
- He bet the yellow.
- I bet the black.

487
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:40,142
- Get up the money, boy.
- Hey, Billy!

488
00:38:40,314 --> 00:38:42,077
Get up the money, boy.

489
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:44,649
Look, them brass buttons
don't make you General Grant.

490
00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:47,845
- Four dollars, boy.
- Four dollars, my eye!

491
00:38:48,022 --> 00:38:49,512
He tried to grab off the money.

492
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,521
I'm gonna grab you off.

493
00:38:51,692 --> 00:38:53,387
Now you gonna grab somebody, soldier?

494
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:56,963
Or you a general?

495
00:38:57,364 --> 00:38:59,059
Who told you to butt
your head in here?

496
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:01,724
You wanna break up
the peace a little bit?

497
00:39:03,137 --> 00:39:06,368
Well, you take the money, general.

498
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,237
And you hold the money up
for the general to take.

499
00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:13,107
Come on, general.
Let's see some cavalry.

500
00:40:03,864 --> 00:40:05,229
Put them down!

501
00:40:14,341 --> 00:40:16,172
Put them down!

502
00:40:56,517 --> 00:40:59,884
- Billy.
- Hey, Pat. Pat Garrett.

503
00:41:00,054 --> 00:41:01,282
Hey, you see them...?

504
00:41:01,455 --> 00:41:04,686
Them posters, "General
Lew Wallace, governor"?

505
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:07,554
You should have seen what we
done to one of his regiments.

506
00:41:07,728 --> 00:41:10,060
We dipped them in flour and
fried them for breakfast.

507
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,959
You best slow down, I'm warning you.

508
00:41:12,132 --> 00:41:15,932
Yeah, I can see you
slowed down some yourself.

509
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:19,799
- When is that wedding?
- That's Sunday.

510
00:41:19,974 --> 00:41:21,202
You Celsa's cousin?

511
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,205
- That goes for me too, ma'am!
- Quiet.

512
00:41:28,382 --> 00:41:30,816
- Now, she invited us to the wedding.
- We'll be there.

513
00:41:30,985 --> 00:41:33,249
What about tonight? Coming
to Pete Maxwell's party?

514
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,409
- Party?
- Party?

515
00:41:34,588 --> 00:41:37,250
- There be whiskey and women?
- All you can drink.

516
00:41:37,424 --> 00:41:38,721
We're gonna get drunk!

517
00:41:42,696 --> 00:41:43,924
- Boys.
- Yep?

518
00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:48,194
Hey, knocking them soldiers together
sort of eased up my shoulder.

519
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,065
How about that, huh?

520
00:41:51,238 --> 00:41:53,103
Come on, Charley.
I'll draw you, come on.

521
00:41:53,273 --> 00:41:55,002
I'm stiff as a board,
I bet I beat you.

522
00:41:55,175 --> 00:41:56,733
No, we're going to Maxwell's party.

523
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:59,344
No, he don't wanna grab no
gun. He wants to grab a gal.

524
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:01,845
Come on, we'll draw. You
too, Tom. Come on, let's go.

525
00:42:02,016 --> 00:42:04,211
I'll bet I beat you,
and I'm stiff as a board.

526
00:42:04,385 --> 00:42:06,683
One, two, three, go!

527
00:42:06,854 --> 00:42:08,583
Come on.

528
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:15,026
We're gonna go fiesta.

529
00:42:30,811 --> 00:42:32,108
Mr. Maxwell.

530
00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:34,270
My name is Moultrie. I
come over from Lincoln.

531
00:42:34,448 --> 00:42:36,177
We heard about your
generous open house.

532
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,614
- Drinks are in at the bar.
- Most generous.

533
00:42:38,786 --> 00:42:41,254
Perhaps we can drink to the amnesty.

534
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:47,455
- Billy.
- Manuel.

535
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,663
Mr. Bonney, you gave me a start.

536
00:42:56,837 --> 00:42:59,635
I suppose you know your name
has been prominent in the paper.

537
00:42:59,807 --> 00:43:01,297
I cut out the articles.

538
00:43:01,475 --> 00:43:05,468
Here. I think this
one might interest you.

539
00:43:11,452 --> 00:43:12,783
Your death notice.

540
00:43:12,953 --> 00:43:14,818
Let me see.

541
00:43:15,255 --> 00:43:17,780
"William Bonney, outlaw youth, dead."

542
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:20,256
Well, now, how you like that?

543
00:43:20,427 --> 00:43:25,592
"Billy Bonney was burned to death,
leaving no surviving relatives."

544
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:32,798
That's not necessary, Mr. Bonney.

545
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,801
I knew you weren't dead.

546
00:43:42,716 --> 00:43:44,479
All right!

547
00:43:45,486 --> 00:43:47,750
Excuse.

548
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,819
Knocked my feet right
out from under me.

549
00:43:51,992 --> 00:43:53,289
- Know who that is?
- Who?

550
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,155
Name was in the Santa Fe paper.

551
00:43:55,329 --> 00:43:57,229
- How come?
- Killed some men.

552
00:43:57,397 --> 00:43:59,092
William Bonney's his name.

553
00:43:59,266 --> 00:44:01,325
I thought he was dead.

554
00:44:07,174 --> 00:44:10,507
Billy, why don't you go in and dance.
There's a little girl in there, Nina.

555
00:44:10,677 --> 00:44:12,338
Wear her hair hang down like a horse.

556
00:44:13,547 --> 00:44:16,311
Come on, take her out on the
porch. Her papa owns a mill.

557
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:19,546
Take her out on the porch.

558
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,280
There is nothing wrong
with you that a woman...

559
00:44:22,456 --> 00:44:24,014
That a young girl can't fix.

560
00:44:34,968 --> 00:44:37,232
Come on, Billy, let's go.

561
00:44:37,404 --> 00:44:39,167
We're gonna stomp some.

562
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:42,470
Go on, her name is Nina.

563
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:49,243
Hey, Billy.

564
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:53,813
- How about one for the wedding?
- Well, well, name in the paper.

565
00:44:53,987 --> 00:44:55,887
- How's the arm?
- I'm working it.

566
00:44:56,056 --> 00:44:58,047
- Getting up your speed?
- Yeah, I'm getting it.

567
00:44:58,225 --> 00:45:00,750
Joe used to wear his gun tied down.

568
00:45:00,928 --> 00:45:02,418
Remember back in Laredo, Joe?

569
00:45:02,596 --> 00:45:04,120
Yeah, we knew what a fast gun was.

570
00:45:04,298 --> 00:45:05,595
That was a hundred years ago.

571
00:45:05,766 --> 00:45:07,666
Boy, you must be hot grease.

572
00:45:07,834 --> 00:45:09,062
He's fast, Joe.

573
00:45:09,236 --> 00:45:11,727
Yeah, I know. Got
his name in the paper.

574
00:45:12,406 --> 00:45:14,499
Joe works for the government now.

575
00:45:14,675 --> 00:45:17,906
Goes through the country to
see how the amnesty holds.

576
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:24,044
- Amnesty?
- That's right.

577
00:45:24,218 --> 00:45:27,119
You say you turn in a report to
the governor, is that right, Joe?

578
00:45:27,287 --> 00:45:30,017
- We keep our eye on the
hot-grease boys. - Yeah.

579
00:45:32,426 --> 00:45:33,654
Are you a law officer?

580
00:45:33,827 --> 00:45:35,624
I carry papers.

581
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,661
Like to shoot?

582
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:39,662
When I have to.

583
00:45:42,102 --> 00:45:43,626
Pearl inlay.

584
00:45:43,804 --> 00:45:45,101
That must have cost you.

585
00:45:45,272 --> 00:45:47,399
That gun was made in Chicago.

586
00:45:47,574 --> 00:45:48,939
Chicago-made.

587
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:50,736
Could I see it?

588
00:45:52,045 --> 00:45:54,741
Gee, I'd sure like to
see your gun, mister.

589
00:46:03,924 --> 00:46:06,324
United States eagle.

590
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:09,295
"J.G."?

591
00:46:09,463 --> 00:46:11,090
Joe Grant.

592
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:18,331
Why, it lays right back of your thumb.

593
00:46:31,151 --> 00:46:33,244
Does that notch...? Does
that stand for a man?

594
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,320
That's what it stands for.

595
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:41,453
You had to put that in
there so you'd remember?

596
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:44,795
That's right.

597
00:46:51,638 --> 00:46:54,129
Was he asleep when you shot him?

598
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,710
I'm just fooling, Joe Grant.

599
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:01,679
Come on, let's get
back to our drinking.

600
00:47:02,316 --> 00:47:03,647
Where's Tom?

601
00:47:03,817 --> 00:47:06,377
My friend asked you to have a drink.

602
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,085
- I'll see you, Pat.
- Sure.

603
00:47:08,255 --> 00:47:10,382
Asked you to have a drink.
Gonna have it or not?

604
00:47:10,557 --> 00:47:12,081
Come on, Joe, settle down.

605
00:47:12,259 --> 00:47:13,783
See you.

606
00:47:14,227 --> 00:47:16,695
You so fast?

607
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:20,759
Why don't you shut
your big amnesty mouth.

608
00:47:21,068 --> 00:47:22,399
- Hey, boy!
- Billy!

609
00:47:25,238 --> 00:47:26,830
Oh, you had to try.

610
00:47:27,007 --> 00:47:29,202
You had to show what a
fast son of a buck you are!

611
00:47:29,376 --> 00:47:31,207
How come it didn't fire, Grant?

612
00:47:31,378 --> 00:47:33,573
Pearl inlays, Chicago-made, amnesty.

613
00:47:33,747 --> 00:47:36,511
Maybe I got my speed, maybe I
don't, but I got you, Joe Grant.

614
00:47:36,683 --> 00:47:38,275
I got you dead, you big mouth!

615
00:47:38,452 --> 00:47:40,113
You wanna try again, huh?

616
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,222
How many cartridges I
take out? One or two?

617
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,052
- Billy.
- Go ahead.

618
00:47:46,226 --> 00:47:49,127
Come on, pull it off, Joe Grant.

619
00:47:49,296 --> 00:47:50,957
It'll fire or go click.

620
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:53,099
Come on, squeeze it off.

621
00:47:53,266 --> 00:47:55,427
Joe. Drop it, Joe.

622
00:47:56,103 --> 00:47:57,934
He'll kill you.

623
00:48:04,644 --> 00:48:07,169
Billy, let him go.

624
00:48:07,347 --> 00:48:10,908
I'm asking you now, let him go.

625
00:48:12,018 --> 00:48:13,383
I'm asking you as a friend.

626
00:48:35,742 --> 00:48:38,210
You say your thanks...

627
00:48:40,147 --> 00:48:42,377
...to Pat Garrett.

628
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:55,056
You're smart, Joe.
You're smart as a whip.

629
00:48:55,228 --> 00:48:56,957
You drive your luck
right in the ground.

630
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,563
I want you to get out of here.

631
00:48:58,732 --> 00:48:59,960
I'll split your sleeves off!

632
00:49:00,133 --> 00:49:01,930
You don't know, Joe.
You came that close.

633
00:49:02,102 --> 00:49:04,935
That kid could drop you. Five
shots up and down your buttons.

634
00:49:05,105 --> 00:49:07,505
He kills you, he kills the
amnesty. But you are smart.

635
00:49:07,674 --> 00:49:10,006
Now, get your horse
and get out of here.

636
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,775
One shot.

637
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:23,085
One 10-cent bullet, and that's it.

638
00:49:24,624 --> 00:49:26,683
Amnesty.

639
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:59,221
Look at that. You see that?

640
00:49:59,392 --> 00:50:01,326
What does it say?

641
00:50:02,429 --> 00:50:04,863
"Outlaw youth, dead."

642
00:50:05,765 --> 00:50:07,926
Keep it for a souvenir.

643
00:50:08,568 --> 00:50:12,971
I ain't dead no more. I come awake.

644
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:18,473
No, Billy, don't go after them.

645
00:50:19,513 --> 00:50:24,348
They had me dead. That
amnesty, that's for them.

646
00:50:24,518 --> 00:50:26,486
For Moon and Hill and Grant.

647
00:50:26,653 --> 00:50:29,281
They walk around, I'm buried.

648
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,583
They put dimes in my eyes.

649
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:34,488
Stop it.

650
00:50:34,661 --> 00:50:36,925
You're shaking like a pony.

651
00:50:37,097 --> 00:50:39,463
Here, you'll catch cold.

652
00:50:39,633 --> 00:50:42,124
No, I'll catch fire.

653
00:50:53,947 --> 00:50:58,782
I got it back. My hand, my arm.

654
00:50:59,185 --> 00:51:02,177
And no one ever gonna
take it away from me.

655
00:51:04,057 --> 00:51:06,287
I'm a-coming to life.

656
00:51:09,195 --> 00:51:11,163
You got a fever.

657
00:51:12,933 --> 00:51:15,993
- Come with me.
- No.

658
00:51:16,703 --> 00:51:19,672
I don't stop now. No more stop.

659
00:51:25,545 --> 00:51:27,638
- I have to go back inside.
- Go.

660
00:51:27,814 --> 00:51:31,079
Go, go, go.

661
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:41,555
Stay here. They'll kill you.

662
00:51:41,861 --> 00:51:43,726
They've been killing me.

663
00:51:44,097 --> 00:51:46,565
Now I don't wait. I go first.

664
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:48,789
What are you going to do?

665
00:51:50,336 --> 00:51:55,296
I don't run, I don't
hide. I go where I want.

666
00:51:57,643 --> 00:51:58,974
I do what I want.

667
00:52:01,981 --> 00:52:07,317
Don't, Billy. Don't do that to me.

668
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:11,217
Don't look at me.

669
00:52:14,193 --> 00:52:17,492
I'll get them, all
of them. I want you.

670
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:21,263
You're choking me. I can't breathe.

671
00:52:23,435 --> 00:52:24,459
With me.

672
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:28,063
No.

673
00:52:33,112 --> 00:52:34,579
Stay.

674
00:52:36,515 --> 00:52:38,380
With you.

675
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:45,222
With you.

676
00:52:52,865 --> 00:52:54,856
Don't do it, Billy.

677
00:52:56,201 --> 00:52:57,759
No.

678
00:52:58,137 --> 00:53:01,163
- With you.
- No.

679
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,274
- With you.
- No.

680
00:53:03,442 --> 00:53:06,570
- No. No.
- With you.

681
00:53:36,975 --> 00:53:38,840
Mr. Bonney.

682
00:53:42,581 --> 00:53:46,142
Enchilada! I want an enchilada.

683
00:53:50,656 --> 00:53:52,283
- Get up.
- I want an enchilada.

684
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:54,187
Go on, get in there. Get Tom.

685
00:53:56,395 --> 00:53:58,920
Tom, you're drunk. Get up here.

686
00:53:59,098 --> 00:54:00,565
Tom, get up here.

687
00:54:00,732 --> 00:54:02,290
Get up here.

688
00:54:02,468 --> 00:54:05,335
Tom! Now, loose that shoulder.

689
00:54:05,504 --> 00:54:08,098
Now, hook. Hook and
draw. Hook and draw!

690
00:54:08,273 --> 00:54:10,138
- My thumb is bleeding.
- Let it bleed!

691
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:11,799
Tom, hook and draw!

692
00:54:11,977 --> 00:54:14,070
- Why? Why?
- We're gonna get Moon.

693
00:54:14,246 --> 00:54:16,237
Hook and draw!

694
00:54:16,415 --> 00:54:18,349
Moon.

695
00:54:46,812 --> 00:54:48,973
Hey, Charley, come on.

696
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:53,980
Go on.

697
00:55:20,245 --> 00:55:23,703
- Hey, boy.
- Yes, sir?

698
00:55:24,016 --> 00:55:27,884
- Do you know a deputy named Moon?
- Yes, sir.

699
00:55:29,054 --> 00:55:31,750
I want you to run down to his house...

700
00:55:32,057 --> 00:55:36,050
...and tell him there's a U.S. Marshal
waiting for him at the sheriff's office.

701
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:38,953
Yes, sir.

702
00:55:47,606 --> 00:55:50,837
- You go against government.
- Don't tell me.

703
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:54,777
We get even first, then
we do what they say.

704
00:55:58,483 --> 00:56:01,475
- He's coming.
- Come on, sit down.

705
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,921
- Act like a deputy.
- Act like a deputy?

706
00:56:43,629 --> 00:56:44,857
Where's your gun, deputy?

707
00:56:57,142 --> 00:56:58,734
Pick it up.

708
00:57:09,588 --> 00:57:13,422
U.S. Marshal don't shoot
a man without a fair draw.

709
00:57:21,133 --> 00:57:24,762
Don't draw on me. Bonney, don't shoot.

710
00:57:27,105 --> 00:57:29,505
What did you do to Tunstall, Moon?

711
00:57:29,808 --> 00:57:33,608
Sheriff Brady gave the
orders. I didn't hit him.

712
00:57:33,779 --> 00:57:35,644
I never hit him.

713
00:57:38,383 --> 00:57:40,214
Bonney, don't shoot.

714
00:57:41,787 --> 00:57:45,746
I didn't hit him. I never hit him.

715
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:49,127
You don't have to kill me, Bonney.

716
00:57:49,294 --> 00:57:51,023
It's over and buried.

717
00:57:51,196 --> 00:57:52,686
You see them amnesty posters?

718
00:57:52,864 --> 00:57:54,991
You see them? You see
what the governor did?

719
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:57,226
Call anyone. Ask anyone.

720
00:57:57,402 --> 00:58:00,701
No one here wants to hurt you, Bonney.
You don't want to hurt anyone here.

721
00:58:00,872 --> 00:58:02,203
Let him go, Billy.

722
00:58:02,374 --> 00:58:03,898
I swear to God, Bonney.

723
00:58:04,076 --> 00:58:06,010
Bonney, no one here wants you boys.

724
00:58:06,178 --> 00:58:10,012
Call anyone, ask anyone.
See if I don't tell you true.

725
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:13,543
Let him go, Billy. He
ain't worth shooting.

726
00:58:13,919 --> 00:58:17,514
Get them out here. I
swear to God, Bonney.

727
00:58:17,689 --> 00:58:21,181
Get them out here. You see? See?

728
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,454
See? See? See, nobody
wants to hurt you.

729
00:58:24,629 --> 00:58:25,857
See? See, Bonney?

730
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:28,261
See, Bonney? Bonney.

731
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,249
You broke it, the
amnesty. You dumb jackass.

732
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:49,746
Dumb, dumb jackass.

733
00:59:22,854 --> 00:59:24,685
Tom.

734
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:29,686
Come on in here.

735
00:59:32,764 --> 00:59:36,757
Billy, look at this. They don't
let us get away with Moon, you hear?

736
00:59:36,935 --> 00:59:38,459
Shirt half out.

737
00:59:38,637 --> 00:59:41,834
- Where is Moon?
- He's buried.

738
00:59:46,011 --> 00:59:50,243
Will you quit blowing
that like nothing happened?

739
00:59:50,415 --> 00:59:52,212
They don't let us get
away with this one.

740
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:53,783
We broke a big law this time.

741
00:59:53,952 --> 00:59:55,749
They put a government
price on our heads.

742
00:59:55,921 --> 00:59:57,286
We got Moon, we gonna get Hill.

743
00:59:57,456 --> 01:00:00,289
Not me. No, sir.

744
01:00:00,992 --> 01:00:02,323
I don't go no more.

745
01:00:03,161 --> 01:00:06,289
One more, it's all over.

746
01:00:06,465 --> 01:00:07,727
What's wrong with restful?

747
01:00:07,899 --> 01:00:10,265
Now, you tell me what's
wrong with restful?

748
01:00:12,637 --> 01:00:15,003
Ain't nothing wrong with restful.

749
01:00:16,141 --> 01:00:18,041
That's what we do.

750
01:00:19,878 --> 01:00:21,505
Leave old Hill to rest.

751
01:00:24,449 --> 01:00:26,314
You mean, let him be?

752
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,185
Leave him wait.

753
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:39,556
We gonna let old Hill set out
there and rest himself to death.

754
01:00:42,701 --> 01:00:45,864
- See you?
- Sure, come on in.

755
01:00:48,373 --> 01:00:50,238
Go on, sit down.

756
01:00:54,212 --> 01:00:56,009
I'm Hill.

757
01:00:56,681 --> 01:00:58,649
Moon is dead.

758
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,253
Bonney?

759
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:08,849
There goes the amnesty.

760
01:01:09,027 --> 01:01:11,621
I talked to Judge Davis.
He said to get you.

761
01:01:11,796 --> 01:01:13,889
- Me?
- He wants you for sheriff.

762
01:01:14,065 --> 01:01:17,523
- I'm getting married, and the clothes...
- You're the best gun in the county.

763
01:01:17,702 --> 01:01:20,262
- Oh, no, I don't want it.
- You fill in the wages yourself.

764
01:01:20,438 --> 01:01:23,498
- You're hereby appointed with power...
- I don't want it, Hill.

765
01:01:24,576 --> 01:01:27,773
Look, you killed Tunstall. Maybe
you got what's coming to you.

766
01:01:30,248 --> 01:01:32,614
I went with them to arrest him.

767
01:01:33,818 --> 01:01:35,547
I was part of it.

768
01:01:38,189 --> 01:01:41,249
But I swear to God I
don't want killing...

769
01:01:41,426 --> 01:01:43,018
...any more than you.

770
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:51,693
I used to see one of
these things and run.

771
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:55,667
- No.
- I got a wife too, Mr. Garrett.

772
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,239
- You gotta help me.
- Come on.

773
01:01:57,409 --> 01:02:00,606
He's got me marked.
Brady, Morton, Moon and me.

774
01:02:00,779 --> 01:02:02,974
- I don't want it.
- I can't run.

775
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:04,975
I need help.

776
01:02:05,317 --> 01:02:07,581
Well, I'll help you all I can.

777
01:02:07,886 --> 01:02:09,786
All except this.

778
01:02:22,601 --> 01:02:26,332
Fourteen, 15, 16...

779
01:02:26,504 --> 01:02:31,305
...17, 18, 19...

780
01:02:31,476 --> 01:02:35,242
...20, 21, 22...

781
01:02:35,413 --> 01:02:39,611
...23, 24, 25...

782
01:02:39,784 --> 01:02:44,244
...26, 27, 28...

783
01:02:44,422 --> 01:02:47,516
...29, 30.

784
01:02:47,692 --> 01:02:49,159
Good.

785
01:03:23,962 --> 01:03:25,395
Hey, Pat.

786
01:03:25,563 --> 01:03:28,828
- Hey, let's see the new missus.
- Hello, Pat.

787
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:31,501
Billy, we heard about Moon.

788
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:34,571
I don't want you to
try anything. Anything.

789
01:03:34,739 --> 01:03:36,866
Oh, Pat, now, we
come for your wedding.

790
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:40,478
- We would have come to the ceremony...
- No trouble. Understand?

791
01:03:40,645 --> 01:03:43,045
No, we don't even get drunk.

792
01:03:44,249 --> 01:03:46,240
Show him the present.

793
01:03:49,087 --> 01:03:51,021
Made out of silver.

794
01:03:51,389 --> 01:03:53,823
You can wear them tonight.

795
01:04:00,865 --> 01:04:02,924
For the little woman.

796
01:04:03,668 --> 01:04:04,999
Cost $ 7.

797
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:08,731
Well, say, I appreciate
this very much.

798
01:04:08,907 --> 01:04:12,934
I really do. I'm very
grateful for her and myself.

799
01:04:13,111 --> 01:04:15,636
What I'm trying to say is...

800
01:04:17,682 --> 01:04:19,081
Hill.

801
01:04:30,128 --> 01:04:33,586
I swear to you, Pat, I didn't
know. I didn't know he was here.

802
01:04:35,467 --> 01:04:37,435
This is my wedding, Billy.

803
01:04:38,303 --> 01:04:42,399
You try to start something,
I'll take it hard.

804
01:04:42,807 --> 01:04:45,867
Well, we don't want no
trouble at your wedding, Pat.

805
01:04:46,044 --> 01:04:47,671
Not here.

806
01:04:48,747 --> 01:04:51,181
Well, later, then. Someplace else.

807
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:54,978
What you do is your business,
but this is my place.

808
01:04:56,054 --> 01:04:58,284
This is my business here.

809
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,628
I won't do a thing, Pat.

810
01:05:03,795 --> 01:05:05,592
We don't want no
trouble at your wedding.

811
01:05:05,764 --> 01:05:07,732
Charley and Tom, they
don't want no trouble.

812
01:05:07,899 --> 01:05:09,730
- No trouble.
- Right.

813
01:05:09,901 --> 01:05:11,630
Give you my word.

814
01:05:12,103 --> 01:05:13,593
Good.

815
01:05:26,451 --> 01:05:28,112
Come on.

816
01:05:29,187 --> 01:05:31,451
Bravo! Bravo.

817
01:05:46,771 --> 01:05:48,398
He keeps looking at me.

818
01:05:48,573 --> 01:05:51,940
- He gave me his word.
- He's got no word.

819
01:05:52,143 --> 01:05:54,668
Hey, Billy, I got a pig full of wine.

820
01:05:54,846 --> 01:05:56,336
What? Oh, stop.

821
01:05:56,514 --> 01:05:58,948
Hey, come on, quit
that. Come on, quit it.

822
01:05:59,117 --> 01:06:01,915
You're gonna get
everybody all wet. Quit it.

823
01:06:09,861 --> 01:06:12,352
Hey, Billy. Billy, come on
and get your picture took.

824
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:13,929
Oh, no.

825
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:17,330
Come on, it don't hurt. He
clamps your head. Come on.

826
01:06:17,602 --> 01:06:18,933
He put your head in the clamp.

827
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:21,038
Sit up on that table. Here.

828
01:06:21,206 --> 01:06:23,106
Then, in half a minute,
an exact likeness.

829
01:06:23,274 --> 01:06:27,267
Eyes, nose, ears, teeth,
everything. Like an oil painting.

830
01:06:29,481 --> 01:06:31,972
You will hold this rifle.

831
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:34,550
It's not dangerous. The
bore is poured full of lead.

832
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:36,812
There's absolutely
no danger. Now, here.

833
01:06:36,988 --> 01:06:38,979
Now... Now, all of you move back.

834
01:06:39,524 --> 01:06:43,016
Now, you will remain
in a fixed position.

835
01:06:44,596 --> 01:06:46,325
You want me?

836
01:06:48,299 --> 01:06:50,290
I don't look for a fight.

837
01:06:51,102 --> 01:06:53,332
I never set out to kill.

838
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:56,007
I set out to arrest the Englishman.

839
01:06:56,174 --> 01:06:57,664
You ask Pat. Ask anyone.

840
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:04,807
I don't use a gun without
a man drawing on me.

841
01:07:05,784 --> 01:07:08,878
You draw on me, I use it.

842
01:07:13,458 --> 01:07:16,222
We're trying to take a picture.

843
01:07:16,394 --> 01:07:18,123
Now, please, don't blink.

844
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:31,769
Look right at the camera
with a pleasant expression.

845
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:40,618
- Pat!
- Billy!

846
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,473
Billy.

847
01:08:06,411 --> 01:08:07,901
Back up.

848
01:08:08,546 --> 01:08:11,606
It is over. It is all over.

849
01:08:11,783 --> 01:08:13,341
Hill, the last one.

850
01:08:13,852 --> 01:08:17,083
But your word. Your word.

851
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:19,518
You said here, Pat.
Here's your wedding.

852
01:08:19,691 --> 01:08:22,159
But he went out,
outside. It's all over.

853
01:08:22,527 --> 01:08:24,392
Poor Tom.

854
01:08:25,296 --> 01:08:27,093
My wedding.

855
01:08:29,767 --> 01:08:31,564
It's here.

856
01:08:33,037 --> 01:08:35,062
It's here.

857
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,505
Here. Here.

858
01:08:39,477 --> 01:08:45,279
This wall, this street, this
town. I married all of it, all.

859
01:08:46,551 --> 01:08:50,317
Look at my wife. Look at
her, look at our friends.

860
01:08:50,488 --> 01:08:51,955
Look at those kids.

861
01:08:52,323 --> 01:08:55,224
He begged me to help
him, and I said no.

862
01:08:55,393 --> 01:08:58,453
He wanted me for
sheriff, and I said no.

863
01:08:59,864 --> 01:09:02,128
Now I say yes.

864
01:09:03,835 --> 01:09:05,735
Yes.

865
01:09:06,237 --> 01:09:08,330
I'm writing my name "sheriff."

866
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:18,409
And I swear by the living God
that I'm gonna put you away.

867
01:09:20,218 --> 01:09:23,551
I'm gonna hunt you
down and put you away!

868
01:09:37,035 --> 01:09:39,060
I'll soak these in water.

869
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:46,870
Is he bad?

870
01:09:47,045 --> 01:09:48,945
His side is red.

871
01:09:49,113 --> 01:09:51,206
You had to go for him, didn't you?

872
01:09:51,382 --> 01:09:54,442
- You wouldn't stop.
- It's all over, Tom.

873
01:09:54,619 --> 01:09:56,644
It ain't ever gonna be over.

874
01:09:56,821 --> 01:09:59,255
Well, it's done. We're free of him.

875
01:09:59,757 --> 01:10:01,418
You don't know.

876
01:10:01,593 --> 01:10:03,390
You heard what Pat Garrett said?

877
01:10:03,561 --> 01:10:05,688
He's gonna come after us.

878
01:10:05,863 --> 01:10:07,694
You don't know a thing.

879
01:10:07,865 --> 01:10:09,856
All I know is how I feel.

880
01:10:13,471 --> 01:10:15,439
I can breathe.

881
01:10:15,607 --> 01:10:19,634
All this time my head was like to
split, all I could see was four men.

882
01:10:19,811 --> 01:10:25,750
But now it's done and I am clean.

883
01:10:29,721 --> 01:10:33,782
Go by the salt flats, then
through the back country.

884
01:10:33,958 --> 01:10:36,358
Now, you won't want that shotgun.

885
01:10:36,527 --> 01:10:38,358
I can use it.

886
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:40,854
Let's go.

887
01:10:53,911 --> 01:10:55,742
This is money.

888
01:10:56,047 --> 01:10:58,277
Men want this kind of money.

889
01:10:58,449 --> 01:11:00,440
They come after it.

890
01:11:00,618 --> 01:11:02,279
They're gonna get it.

891
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,381
Leave off.

892
01:11:04,922 --> 01:11:07,720
All right, Charley,
you stay on with Billy.

893
01:11:07,892 --> 01:11:10,656
End up on your back
with your jaw dropped.

894
01:11:12,096 --> 01:11:14,121
I'm going home.

895
01:11:14,866 --> 01:11:16,800
Visit my folks.

896
01:11:18,303 --> 01:11:21,568
My ma, she knows how to
ease this pain in my side.

897
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,344
You let him go?

898
01:11:28,746 --> 01:11:30,771
He don't stop me.

899
01:11:31,983 --> 01:11:33,917
You don't stop me.

900
01:11:35,887 --> 01:11:38,913
There ain't nobody gonna stop
you. Why would I wanna stop you?

901
01:11:39,657 --> 01:11:41,318
You got your blanket, your pack roll?

902
01:11:41,492 --> 01:11:42,823
Yeah.

903
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,099
Take some more cartridges.

904
01:11:50,268 --> 01:11:52,133
- No, I got enough.
- No, come on, take them.

905
01:11:52,303 --> 01:11:55,204
- Anything to see you through.
- Look, I don't want any more.

906
01:11:58,176 --> 01:11:59,609
Well...

907
01:12:05,049 --> 01:12:06,914
You best be going.

908
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:15,755
You got a long way to go
and you got a bad side.

909
01:12:30,675 --> 01:12:33,439
Best not ride too
much in the daylight.

910
01:12:50,995 --> 01:12:52,758
Done run out.

911
01:12:53,398 --> 01:12:56,128
That skinny dog run out.

912
01:12:58,669 --> 01:13:02,070
Takes his pack and
he leaves us to go on.

913
01:13:02,373 --> 01:13:04,898
Go on, run.

914
01:13:05,576 --> 01:13:07,601
Scared to death.

915
01:13:09,046 --> 01:13:11,537
I don't want you. Go on.

916
01:13:11,716 --> 01:13:13,377
Run.

917
01:13:18,055 --> 01:13:19,249
Hey, Tom.

918
01:13:31,569 --> 01:13:33,537
Tom! Tom!

919
01:13:33,704 --> 01:13:35,763
Come on. Get in here.

920
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,703
You see? You see that?

921
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:40,105
A shotgun!

922
01:13:51,756 --> 01:13:53,747
We got food. We gonna wait till dark.

923
01:13:58,563 --> 01:14:01,031
- You see them?
- Yeah, up in the hill, below the ridge.

924
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:02,928
Now get back.

925
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,534
- lf they come around back?
- We got enough to stop them.

926
01:14:05,736 --> 01:14:06,964
You see Tom?

927
01:14:07,138 --> 01:14:08,799
- Come on now, get back!
- Did he move?

928
01:14:08,973 --> 01:14:11,441
Did you see him move?
Maybe he ain't dead.

929
01:14:11,609 --> 01:14:13,975
Well, they hit him with
a shotgun. He's dead.

930
01:14:18,349 --> 01:14:19,338
Here.

931
01:14:20,351 --> 01:14:23,115
He's not dead. He's
begging us to help him.

932
01:14:23,287 --> 01:14:24,618
- No.
- I heard him.

933
01:14:24,789 --> 01:14:27,952
- Keep down!
- Billy, we gotta help...

934
01:14:36,767 --> 01:14:38,462
My chest.

935
01:14:40,204 --> 01:14:43,799
Billy, I can't move my head.

936
01:14:45,176 --> 01:14:47,076
Billy, my neck.

937
01:14:51,215 --> 01:14:54,082
Charley, I told you.

938
01:14:54,252 --> 01:14:56,413
I feel my blood.

939
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:05,751
Billy, help me up. I can't move.

940
01:15:06,297 --> 01:15:08,231
Stay down. Don't move.

941
01:15:10,001 --> 01:15:11,764
Now, help me up.

942
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:14,361
Billy, help me.

943
01:15:18,676 --> 01:15:20,439
Help me up.

944
01:15:21,913 --> 01:15:23,141
Help me stand up.

945
01:15:23,648 --> 01:15:25,980
Oh, for the love of God.
I'm all right standing up.

946
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:28,516
I don't die standing
up. Help me, Billy!

947
01:15:28,686 --> 01:15:31,246
Help me...

948
01:15:32,156 --> 01:15:34,181
You wanna go?

949
01:15:37,094 --> 01:15:38,322
I don't care.

950
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:41,655
Come on, stand up!

951
01:15:41,832 --> 01:15:43,891
You wanna go?

952
01:15:44,068 --> 01:15:47,936
Go on. I don't want you. Go on!

953
01:16:11,062 --> 01:16:12,552
Bonney.

954
01:16:14,098 --> 01:16:17,534
Bill Bonney, come out!

955
01:16:18,135 --> 01:16:20,069
Come out that door.

956
01:16:21,472 --> 01:16:23,269
I'll let you live.

957
01:16:25,776 --> 01:16:27,676
Drop your gun.

958
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:31,346
Come out with your
arms at your shoulders.

959
01:17:20,465 --> 01:17:22,262
What do you figure the judge gave him?

960
01:17:22,433 --> 01:17:23,991
Hang him.

961
01:17:25,803 --> 01:17:28,294
He was a wild boy when we caught him.

962
01:17:28,473 --> 01:17:31,442
Yeah? Well, he's had a
couple of days to cool off.

963
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,636
Watch is all sweaty.

964
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:36,808
Hang him, huh?

965
01:17:40,885 --> 01:17:43,285
Hey, Ollinger, what did they give him?

966
01:17:43,454 --> 01:17:46,946
A hanging. We're gonna hang him.

967
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:55,390
All right, you guys, get back.
Get back in there. All right.

968
01:17:55,566 --> 01:17:58,364
- Get those people back there, let's go.
- Back in there.

969
01:18:08,179 --> 01:18:10,010
Get them back.

970
01:18:16,554 --> 01:18:18,181
Get in there.

971
01:18:20,525 --> 01:18:25,690
All right, Billy, up the
stairs. Get up from here.

972
01:18:25,863 --> 01:18:27,455
Go ahead.

973
01:18:31,969 --> 01:18:33,869
Down that door.

974
01:19:03,768 --> 01:19:04,792
Judge said Friday.

975
01:19:06,771 --> 01:19:08,966
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...

976
01:19:09,874 --> 01:19:11,637
...Thursday...

977
01:19:13,411 --> 01:19:15,038
...Friday.

978
01:19:15,847 --> 01:19:17,747
That's your day.

979
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:21,045
That's the day we gonna hang you.

980
01:19:21,986 --> 01:19:24,352
- Bring him out!
- Get me the boy!

981
01:19:24,522 --> 01:19:25,648
Get him for me!

982
01:19:27,058 --> 01:19:32,018
Hang him! Whip him! Make
him tell. Where is he?

983
01:19:32,196 --> 01:19:34,289
Where is my husband?

984
01:19:34,866 --> 01:19:37,892
You. You boy, I take your gun.

985
01:19:38,569 --> 01:19:40,662
- Who is that?
- Husband!

986
01:19:40,838 --> 01:19:43,170
- Husband!
- Mrs. Hill, it sounds like.

987
01:19:43,341 --> 01:19:45,332
- Hill's widow?
- I want that boy!

988
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:47,273
I'm gonna break the door!

989
01:19:47,445 --> 01:19:50,141
You'll never try that again, Mason.

990
01:19:50,314 --> 01:19:52,009
Next man who starts
up is under arrest.

991
01:19:52,183 --> 01:19:54,276
Now, go on, get home. Take her home.

992
01:19:54,452 --> 01:19:56,545
Go on. Get off the streets.

993
01:19:56,721 --> 01:19:59,815
But I want him. I want
the boy. I want him!

994
01:19:59,991 --> 01:20:02,050
I want the boy!

995
01:20:02,226 --> 01:20:05,423
Get me the boy! I want him!

996
01:20:06,197 --> 01:20:08,495
Get him for me!

997
01:20:09,433 --> 01:20:14,700
I want the boy! I want him!

998
01:20:29,821 --> 01:20:31,550
Mister.

999
01:20:36,294 --> 01:20:38,489
You murdered somebody?

1000
01:20:39,997 --> 01:20:41,521
No.

1001
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:45,929
Sure, I know you.
You murdered four men.

1002
01:20:47,805 --> 01:20:50,706
Well, I killed them, maybe,
but that ain't murder.

1003
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:53,776
Hey, you better get out of here,
kid, before you break your neck.

1004
01:20:55,613 --> 01:20:59,413
Hey, you kids, get out of here!

1005
01:20:59,584 --> 01:21:01,245
I catch you, I kick you.

1006
01:21:01,886 --> 01:21:04,878
They're coming from other towns.

1007
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:07,885
Why do they want to see?

1008
01:21:11,295 --> 01:21:13,490
They think they know him.

1009
01:21:13,965 --> 01:21:15,899
They heard his name.

1010
01:21:16,734 --> 01:21:20,795
His name has spread east, cities east.

1011
01:21:22,273 --> 01:21:25,208
They've never seen anyone famous.

1012
01:21:25,943 --> 01:21:27,843
How soon is it over?

1013
01:21:29,647 --> 01:21:31,877
Friday, in the morning.

1014
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:35,311
Do you have to do it?

1015
01:21:40,758 --> 01:21:42,783
I thought I wanted it.

1016
01:21:44,195 --> 01:21:46,755
But when the judge said hang him...

1017
01:21:46,931 --> 01:21:48,831
...he looked surprised.

1018
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,427
Surprised.

1019
01:21:56,073 --> 01:21:58,132
There ain't nobody allowed in there.

1020
01:21:58,309 --> 01:22:00,470
But I know him personally.

1021
01:22:00,845 --> 01:22:03,814
You and about 10,000 others.

1022
01:22:03,981 --> 01:22:06,211
I brought him some comforts.

1023
01:22:07,985 --> 01:22:09,680
Can I talk to him?

1024
01:22:11,455 --> 01:22:13,389
He won't answer you.

1025
01:22:14,725 --> 01:22:16,750
He'll answer me.

1026
01:22:19,563 --> 01:22:23,431
Mr. Bonney? Mr. Bonney?

1027
01:22:23,968 --> 01:22:27,267
It's me, Moultrie.

1028
01:22:28,005 --> 01:22:32,999
Remember? "Rally
around the flag, boys."

1029
01:22:34,412 --> 01:22:38,280
Mr. Bonney, I gave you your
death notice in the paper.

1030
01:22:38,449 --> 01:22:40,178
Do you recall?

1031
01:22:41,953 --> 01:22:43,614
Well, I'm set up in business now.

1032
01:22:44,055 --> 01:22:45,920

1033
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:47,887
You helped me...

1034
01:22:48,092 --> 01:22:51,960
...so I brought you some
comforts, Mr. Bonney.

1035
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:54,930
Box of shortbread.

1036
01:22:55,099 --> 01:22:57,226
Some clean linen.

1037
01:22:57,802 --> 01:22:59,929
The guards may inspect it.

1038
01:23:02,974 --> 01:23:06,239
You care for reading matter, Mr.
Bonney? I have lots of books from you...

1039
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:07,741
About you from the East here.

1043
01:23:38,009 --> 01:23:41,445

1044
01:23:41,812 --> 01:23:43,507
Yeah?

1045
01:23:43,681 --> 01:23:45,672
Do you read all them books?

1046
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:47,750
You can read?

1047
01:23:48,085 --> 01:23:49,950
Yeah, I read.

1048
01:23:50,187 --> 01:23:51,950
What do they say?

1049
01:23:54,191 --> 01:23:57,217
They say I'm a figure of glory.

1050
01:24:28,559 --> 01:24:30,083
Oh, come on, Billy.

1051
01:24:42,106 --> 01:24:43,505
Billy, stop.

1052
01:24:47,211 --> 01:24:49,304
Billy. Billy.

1053
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,574
Billy, come on. Now, don't
go... Billy, don't go for a...

1054
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:55,241
Don't come up, Bell!
Don't, Bell, don't!

1055
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,849
I've gotta, Billy.

1056
01:25:29,453 --> 01:25:33,549
Hey, Ollinger. Bell
just killed the kid.

1057
01:25:39,763 --> 01:25:42,163
Hey, Bob.

1058
01:26:29,446 --> 01:26:31,914
- Ramirez?
- Yes, sir.

1059
01:26:32,349 --> 01:26:33,839
Bonney.

1060
01:26:38,923 --> 01:26:40,857
You know him?

1061
01:26:41,292 --> 01:26:43,954
- Billy the Kid?
- You know him?

1062
01:26:44,128 --> 01:26:46,096
I know who he is.

1063
01:26:46,263 --> 01:26:48,595
You say he's run to Mexico?

1064
01:26:48,766 --> 01:26:50,734
That's my guess.

1065
01:26:50,901 --> 01:26:53,802
- You seen him?
- No.

1066
01:26:58,042 --> 01:27:00,203
You seen him, mister?

1067
01:27:01,712 --> 01:27:04,647
No, sir, I did not see him.

1068
01:30:31,222 --> 01:30:33,281
We're going back to Madero.

1069
01:30:33,457 --> 01:30:35,687
He'd never go back to Madero.

1070
01:30:36,394 --> 01:30:38,259
Well, that's where we're going.

1071
01:31:31,916 --> 01:31:33,508
I knew I'd find you.

1072
01:31:33,684 --> 01:31:36,380
I was in Lincoln when you shot
Ollinger. I saw you break out.

1073
01:31:36,554 --> 01:31:38,283
I brought you those books.

1074
01:31:38,456 --> 01:31:39,787
Wait, wait.

1075
01:31:39,957 --> 01:31:42,425
You remember the
photographer at the wedding?

1076
01:31:42,593 --> 01:31:44,891
Well, I met him Lincoln.

1077
01:31:45,062 --> 01:31:47,223
He gave me your picture.

1078
01:31:50,468 --> 01:31:52,095
I have another here.

1079
01:31:52,269 --> 01:31:54,260
I made him go over with
me to the courthouse.

1080
01:31:54,438 --> 01:31:58,306
Your two friends,
before they were buried.

1081
01:31:58,609 --> 01:32:02,204
You can see the wounds in Charley.

1082
01:32:22,633 --> 01:32:26,262
- You take anything from them?
- No, no. I didn't touch them.

1083
01:32:26,437 --> 01:32:28,029
- Did you?
- No, I didn't.

1084
01:32:28,205 --> 01:32:30,264
You stay away from me.
You stay away from them.

1085
01:32:30,441 --> 01:32:32,568
I'll tell people. I'll
tell people how you live.

1086
01:32:32,743 --> 01:32:34,870
I write letters about you
to the East, to Boston.

1087
01:32:35,045 --> 01:32:36,706
Stories for books.

1088
01:32:38,649 --> 01:32:40,241
What is it?

1089
01:32:40,985 --> 01:32:43,010
What's wrong?

1090
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:44,244
You all right?

1091
01:32:45,823 --> 01:32:47,188
You're not like the books.

1092
01:32:48,726 --> 01:32:51,251
You don't wear silver studs.

1093
01:32:51,896 --> 01:32:54,126
You don't stand up to glory.

1094
01:32:59,103 --> 01:33:01,128
You're not him.

1095
01:33:02,673 --> 01:33:04,436
You're not him.

1096
01:33:08,245 --> 01:33:10,270
You're not him.

1097
01:33:52,723 --> 01:33:54,190
You want anything?

1098
01:33:54,358 --> 01:33:56,223
I'm wore-out.

1099
01:33:56,393 --> 01:33:58,224
Get some sleep.

1100
01:33:58,762 --> 01:34:01,287
We'll try the west
hills in the morning.

1101
01:34:30,327 --> 01:34:31,760
Maybe you ought to let him go.

1102
01:34:36,901 --> 01:34:38,994
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

1103
01:34:52,449 --> 01:34:54,007
Mr. Garrett.

1104
01:34:54,885 --> 01:34:56,250
Sheriff.

1105
01:34:59,123 --> 01:35:03,423
He has got to be stopped.

1106
01:35:06,597 --> 01:35:08,656
I don't want the reward.

1107
01:35:11,502 --> 01:35:13,367
People will take it
away from me anyway.

1108
01:35:31,722 --> 01:35:33,349
Go on.

1109
01:35:56,447 --> 01:35:58,415
- Billy.
- Open the door.

1110
01:35:58,582 --> 01:36:00,106
You do not want to come back here.

1111
01:36:00,284 --> 01:36:02,218
- No, open the door, Saval.
- Go away, please.

1112
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:12,327
Go away. I give you some money.

1113
01:36:12,496 --> 01:36:15,693
- Help you get a horse.
- No. No.

1114
01:36:19,737 --> 01:36:21,204
I stay here.

1115
01:36:21,372 --> 01:36:23,431
They chase you. They
know you will come here.

1116
01:36:23,607 --> 01:36:25,666
I got no place else.

1117
01:36:25,843 --> 01:36:28,505
- Mexico?
- No, no, right here with you.

1118
01:36:28,679 --> 01:36:30,909
I'll stay here.

1119
01:36:31,081 --> 01:36:32,309
Fever.

1120
01:36:32,483 --> 01:36:33,916
- I have to.
- Like after the fire.

1121
01:36:34,084 --> 01:36:36,279
I have to, Saval.

1122
01:36:39,623 --> 01:36:41,147
Stay.

1123
01:36:43,327 --> 01:36:45,625
I'm gonna sleep.

1124
01:36:54,738 --> 01:36:58,538
- The Mexican people, they see you.
- They will not tell.

1125
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:02,178
He's all fever.

1126
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,009
- He can't stay here.
- In the back.

1127
01:37:05,182 --> 01:37:06,479
No, not now.

1128
01:37:08,552 --> 01:37:10,349
You can't stay here.

1129
01:37:11,355 --> 01:37:13,915
I have no place else to go.

1130
01:37:14,825 --> 01:37:18,784
- Not with us.
- Celsa, what do you want him to do?

1131
01:37:18,962 --> 01:37:21,089
- Stay with you.
- No!

1132
01:37:21,265 --> 01:37:22,630
What is it? What?

1133
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,166
- With me. With...
- Not to him.

1134
01:37:25,335 --> 01:37:27,303
Don't kill him.

1135
01:37:35,913 --> 01:37:38,746
Celsa, you...?

1136
01:37:40,918 --> 01:37:44,479
You and him?

1137
01:38:07,711 --> 01:38:11,738
Oh, no, no, no, Saval.

1138
01:38:15,786 --> 01:38:19,745
Saval, please. I don't want him.

1139
01:38:22,726 --> 01:38:23,784
Get out.

1140
01:38:39,109 --> 01:38:43,409
I come here not to kill.

1141
01:38:45,382 --> 01:38:47,441
Not to kill him.

1142
01:38:55,859 --> 01:38:57,986
I lost Tom.

1143
01:38:58,162 --> 01:39:00,221
I lost Charley.

1144
01:39:01,131 --> 01:39:02,928
I can't read.

1145
01:39:05,135 --> 01:39:07,695
I got myself all killed.

1146
01:39:13,677 --> 01:39:15,907
Saval, you help me.

1147
01:39:20,317 --> 01:39:21,648
We don't want you.

1148
01:39:30,027 --> 01:39:32,257
You help me.

1149
01:39:47,177 --> 01:39:48,508
Please.

1150
01:39:48,679 --> 01:39:50,203
Billy.

1151
01:39:52,015 --> 01:39:54,006
Don't go for your gun.

1152
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:58,711
Keep your hands away from your sides.

1153
01:40:01,124 --> 01:40:02,489
He's here.

1154
01:40:05,128 --> 01:40:08,427
Don't move, Billy.

1155
01:40:09,933 --> 01:40:11,798
I don't wanna kill you.

1156
01:40:12,369 --> 01:40:14,166
Not by him.

1157
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,005
Please, Saval.

1158
01:40:24,548 --> 01:40:26,209
Billy.

1159
01:40:27,384 --> 01:40:29,215
Come to me.

1160
01:40:33,624 --> 01:40:35,091
Billy.

1161
01:40:36,326 --> 01:40:37,918
Come to me.

1162
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:41,948
He went for an empty holster.

1163
01:41:46,396 --> 01:41:47,454
I couldn't see.

1164
01:41:59,209 --> 01:42:00,574
You come home now.

1165
01:42:16,927 --> 01:42:18,918
