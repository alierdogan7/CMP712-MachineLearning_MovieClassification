1
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,124
New Mexico

2
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,918
And that's why I tell you
to stay out of New Mexico.

3
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,344
And there ain't
no law but this.

4
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,380
Show him in.

5
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,737
and his help would be
invaluable to us.

6
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:55,485
I hoped you'd
say that, Steele.

7
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,082
Certainly.

8
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,465
So they're sending
another deputy, eh.

9
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,005
Boys, here's
to the big herd.

10
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,398
Hyah, hyah, hyah, hyah

11
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,569
There's
a man following us.

12
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,073
He ain't a-followin' us now.

13
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:31,531
Hyah, ho, ho!

14
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,128
Sounds like cows.

15
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:49,432
Ho, ho! It's Arizona.

16
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,769
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

17
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,868
Hey, fellas.
Shh, don't let on, now.

18
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:16,242
Well, boss, I got over
200 head this time.

19
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:36,979
in that fool country.

20
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,313
Come on, Lem.

21
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,403
gonna get any practice

22
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:04,493
Oh.

23
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:27,183
He's been around here
drunk for two days.

24
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,522
Well, come on,
let's drink up.

25
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,673
Everybody okay?

26
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,385
Aw, get out!

27
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:07,390
Look!

28
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,397
Well, where'd that come from

29
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,297
Might have knowed
he'd show up today.

30
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,682
Buenos dias, amigos!
Ha, ha.

31
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:37,697
The great cattle baron.

32
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,429
Hey, senor.

33
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,960
Somebody's going
to get very rich.

34
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:19,665
Ha.

35
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,503
Is everybody all right?

36
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,476
You had a pretty hard trip,
didn't you?

37
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,082
Yeah.

38
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,845
Here comes
Mr. Crew now.

39
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,217
How are you?

40
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,413
with rustlers,
renegades and bad men.

41
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,855
Pleasure, Miss Malloy.
How do you do?

42
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,861
Lay off of that kid!

43
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,980
So long, pardner.

44
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,435
Goodbye, miss.

45
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,740
Get out of here.

46
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,499
All right, Cal,
that road straight ahead, huh?

47
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,703
Ow!

48
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:57,299
I like your spirit

49
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:02,805
Thanks.

50
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,042
Aha.

51
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:58,444
and I wouldn't be
caught nappin'.

52
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,444
Well, that's mig
hty fine of you, Mr. Steele.

53
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,415
Everything's just fine.

54
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,621
My, isn't this
a lovely view from here.

55
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,712
Pat!

56
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,556
If I get my hands on you...

57
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:01,984
I'll see you tonight.

58
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,975
Wait.

59
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:07,859
What's that?

60
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,749
Oh!

61
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,621
Brett!

62
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,040
It's Arizona!

63
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,710
Get him back

64
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,388
Come on.

65
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:05,634
Get some water, quick.
Get some water.

66
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:13,842
Come on, let's get
out of here.

67
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:20,399
John, look! Cattle rustlers!

68
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,570
Duke!

69
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:55,217
Get up.

70
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:10,732
Duke!

71
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,486
Cattle.
Round'em up.

72
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:34,923
Stick it up, boys.

73
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,097
Get out of here!

74
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,696
Hyah!

75
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,566
Vamos, amigos.

76
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,329
Aw, don't worry.
We'll catch him.

77
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,136

78
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,980
Boy, I'm sure hungry.

79
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,483
Shh!

80
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,542
Afraid you'd be
late for breakfast.

81
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,356
Stand up.

82
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,046
Who the devil are you?

83
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,308
and I figured you in
on the deal.

84
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,406
and I'm counting
on your help.

85
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,366
Get back against that wall

86
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,050
I'm arrestin' Arizona
for the murder of Cal Brett.

87
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:26,631
Set'em up here, bartender.

88
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,975
Here comes the deputy now.

89
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,463
John Steele.

90
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,600
Aw, come on,
let's have another drink here.

91
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:44,542
What's that?

92
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,839
Hey, hey.

93
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:05,873
Hm.
Aw.

94
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,918
Ahhh.

95
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,978
Duke, Duke, the door!

96
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,516
What's that?

97
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,616
Not a soul in sight.

98
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,012
It just an accident.

99
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,798
It's 9:00.

100
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,803
I'll show you.

101
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:07,361
Stick'em up, Arizona.

102
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,987
Turn around.

103
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:19,040
All right, get going.

104
00:34:20,374 --> 00:34:21,709
Get a move on.

105
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,970
you'll never get out of 
here alive with Arizona.

106
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,933
Just a minute.

107
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:51,322
What?

108
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:56,160
all of you

109
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:00,081
In the name of the law

110
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,952
Now, get in that cell.

111
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,717
Let's get out of
this rat's nest here.

112
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,770
Come on. Let's get out of here

113
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,023
Keep it up, boys.
They're retreating.

114
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:30,955

115
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,815
Mr. Crew
ain't fooling meany.

116
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,377
get the boss.

117
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,756
Hey, come on, boy. Come on

118
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:02,964
Yee-hoo!

119
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,385
Give it to'em, Bossy boy.

120
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:39,917
Hurry up, boys.
I hope he ain't hurt?

121
00:38:42,503 --> 00:38:44,922
Where's Arizona?

122
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:56,017
I'll be meetin' up with
him before long.

123
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:04,692
Get on that horse.

124
00:39:05,693 --> 00:39:06,694
There you are.

125
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:48,319
That's fine,sir. Hmm.

126
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:48,846
Say, pardner,
I wanna talk to you.

127
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:20,461
Let me go!
Sonora!

128
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,926
for spoiling
the big romance.

129
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,273
Let's see.
Where were you

130
00:41:50,658 --> 00:41:53,527
Right where I never
should have been interrupted.

131
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,200
Hey, John!

132
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:02,503
Pardon me.

133
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:10,461
Thank you.

134
00:42:34,368 --> 00:42:35,736
I wonder if we'll
get a good price

135
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:21,248
Round up every gunman
in the valley.

136
00:44:10,664 --> 00:44:13,467
Well, major, good
to hear this talk.

137
00:44:31,652 --> 00:44:34,655
See you all
at the fort, I hope.

138
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,471
They wake me up
in the middle of the night...

139
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,674
I'll see he don't get away.

140
00:45:50,764 --> 00:45:54,268
Once more, boys. Let's go.

141
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,861
Come on, let's go.

142
00:47:48,348 --> 00:47:50,634
Whoa. Whoa.

143
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:42,402
Vamos!

144
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:56,533
Giddyap, buddy.

145
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:07,844
Where's Ginger?

146
00:49:14,968 --> 00:49:17,054
Giddyap, Mike, giddyap.

147
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,260
Are you all right?
Hello, darling.

148
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:09,489
Bring'em up the hill.

149
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,703
Get those buzzards!

150
00:50:25,672 --> 00:50:27,040
They're turning the herd.

151
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:32,629
Come on.

152
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,327
Madre de dios.

153
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:14,921
Put them in the mill.

154
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:34,691
Turn the herd.

155
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:38,695
Hoo-ha!

156
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:42,866
They're coming around, boys.

157
00:51:52,793 --> 00:51:55,378
They got them in the mill.

158
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:12,562
They saved'em.

159
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:31,081
Aww, that's too far.

160
00:52:44,477 --> 00:52:46,062
Giddyap.
