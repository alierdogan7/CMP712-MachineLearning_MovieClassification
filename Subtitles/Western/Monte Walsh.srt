To me, Chet ain't dead yet.

707
01:20:42,684 --> 01:20:45,619
- I got word from Consolida...
- I ain't interested.

708
01:20:46,155 --> 01:20:48,180
I'm afraid you'll have to be.

709
01:20:48,357 --> 01:20:50,985
They've given up on the Slash Y.

710
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,822
For the time being,
they want to fence in all their land.

711
01:20:53,996 --> 01:20:55,588
That's all.

712
01:20:58,934 --> 01:21:01,164
That's gonna be a lot of fence.

713
01:21:01,336 --> 01:21:04,203
I was gonna tell the rest of the boys
after the funeral.

714
01:21:04,306 --> 01:21:06,035
But I tell you now,

715
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:09,302
just in case you didn't wanna
ride back this way.

716
01:21:09,745 --> 01:21:11,474
Here's your pay.

717
01:21:13,515 --> 01:21:14,914
Thanks.

718
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:18,777
Oh, would you tell Dolly to put that
Chet was from Illinois on his marker?

719
01:21:18,954 --> 01:21:20,387
Sure.

720
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:24,718
Chet was proud of that.

721
01:21:26,828 --> 01:21:29,319
Oh, and tell Mary
why I'm not there, huh?

722
01:21:29,498 --> 01:21:31,159
I will.

723
01:22:07,736 --> 01:22:09,829
Where's the man belongs
to that spotted horse?

724
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:12,503
Oh, he's been gone
quite some time.

725
01:22:12,674 --> 01:22:15,142
Trade his horse for a fresh one,
had a drink and left.

726
01:22:16,211 --> 01:22:17,542
How long a while?

727
01:22:17,713 --> 01:22:20,273
I'd say three hours.

728
01:22:21,149 --> 01:22:24,050
- What color he trade for?
- Black.

729
01:22:26,588 --> 01:22:28,613
What you got your hands up for?

730
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:31,720
[CHUCKLES]

731
01:22:49,745 --> 01:22:51,838
- Hey, Monte.
- Sugar.

732
01:22:52,014 --> 01:22:53,504
You'd never guess
who come by earlier.

733
01:22:53,682 --> 01:22:54,876
Shorty.

734
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:56,540
Yeah.

735
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:59,144
I'm after him.

736
01:22:59,921 --> 01:23:01,388
You doing the law's work?

737
01:23:01,556 --> 01:23:04,491
Shorty blowed Chet's head off
with a double-barrel shotgun.

738
01:23:05,694 --> 01:23:07,161
Oh, God, no.

739
01:23:09,064 --> 01:23:10,622
Why?

740
01:23:10,799 --> 01:23:12,061
Chet couldn't say.

741
01:23:14,936 --> 01:23:16,403
You working here?

742
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:17,595
How long? You like it?

743
01:23:20,676 --> 01:23:21,734
Got a good stove.

744
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:23,571
I figure on staying
through the winter.

745
01:23:23,745 --> 01:23:27,146
Last winter Chet and me
was in a line camp for the Cross Bar.

746
01:23:27,316 --> 01:23:29,910
I was punching for Double Six.

747
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:33,014
Did Shorty trade horses?

748
01:23:33,188 --> 01:23:34,553
No.

749
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:36,281
Monte.

750
01:23:37,259 --> 01:23:41,093
I hate to be the one to tell you this,
but I hear Martine's in a bad way.

751
01:23:47,769 --> 01:23:49,930
Thought you might wanna know.

752
01:24:25,741 --> 01:24:27,732
You're too late, mister.

753
01:24:27,909 --> 01:24:29,604
She didn't wanna hold on
any longer.

754
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:49,089
You must be Walsh.

755
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:51,857
She said you'd come.

756
01:24:54,336 --> 01:24:56,327
I did all I could.

757
01:24:59,841 --> 01:25:01,365
Believe me, I did.

758
01:25:08,884 --> 01:25:10,943
I'm taking care of the funeral.

759
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:14,018
I came away kind of fast,
but I got some cash, doc.

760
01:25:14,189 --> 01:25:16,316
No, it's all fixed up.

761
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:19,923
Funny about that.

762
01:25:20,328 --> 01:25:24,458
She was always particular
about most things.

763
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:28,870
Had enough put aside
to give her a real nice one.

764
01:25:30,739 --> 01:25:32,001
Foreign girl, wasn't she?

765
01:25:33,575 --> 01:25:34,837
Yeah.

766
01:25:36,511 --> 01:25:38,479
She was a countess.

767
01:25:44,352 --> 01:25:48,379
Girls like that
sure do get some strange notions.

768
01:25:54,729 --> 01:26:01,726
All the time she was here
she hung on to that little box.

769
01:29:10,992 --> 01:29:12,584
SHORTY:
Monte!

770
01:29:14,763 --> 01:29:16,993
Ain't you ever coming out?

771
01:29:47,128 --> 01:29:48,891
I knew you'd be coming for me,
Monte.

772
01:29:53,201 --> 01:29:55,965
No sense wearing out
good horses chasing.

773
01:30:04,446 --> 01:30:07,882
I figured you'd be here
after Sugar told you about Martine.

774
01:30:10,318 --> 01:30:12,411
You should have told him
about Chet too.

775
01:30:17,258 --> 01:30:19,249
There's no use talking, I suppose.

776
01:30:21,029 --> 01:30:22,053
No use.

777
01:30:37,846 --> 01:30:39,746
Turn around, Shorty.

778
01:31:16,751 --> 01:31:18,912

779
01:32:25,753 --> 01:32:27,152
Come on.

[GUNSHOT]

782
01:35:23,197 --> 01:35:24,562
I'm here, Shorty.

783
01:36:03,805 --> 01:36:05,466
I rode down the gray.

784
01:36:14,882 --> 01:36:16,941
You had to sit him high.

785
01:36:38,072 --> 01:36:40,336
Well, lookie here.

786
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:54,153
Did I ever tell you
about Big Joe Abernathy?

787
01:36:54,755 --> 01:36:56,245
[NEIGHS]

788
01:36:57,158 --> 01:36:59,626
Well, he used to wrestle wolves.

789
01:37:04,165 --> 01:37:06,326
Well, I never seen him do it.

790
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:08,264
But I heard tell, and I knew Joe.

791
01:37:12,707 --> 01:37:15,608
I always wondered
how you would wrestle a wolf.

792
01:37:26,287 --> 01:37:27,720
Yeah.

793
01:37:29,757 --> 01:37:32,157
Well, we got better things to do
than shoot wolves.

794
01:37:32,326 --> 01:37:34,851
Now, let me tell you
about Big Joe Abernathy.

795
01:37:35,029 --> 01:37:36,394
This boy was big.

796
01:37:36,564 --> 01:37:38,862
Now, he'd come up
around Denver way...
