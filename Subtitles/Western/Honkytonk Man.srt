1
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:41,527
Take it on down to the house! Come on!

2
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,691
Hey, somebody's coming.

3
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:39,162
Company?

4
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,211
At a time like this?

5
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,812
It's Uncle Red!

6
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:12,004
Bubba!

7
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,246
Is he dead?

8
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:22,443
- Dead drunk.
- Bubba! What in the world!

9
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,688
Let's get him on up into the house.

10
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:34,771
Whit, you bring in his grip.

11
00:04:35,373 --> 00:04:38,763
- Where's his grip?
- He don't have one. Just this guitar.

12
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:41,083
These are all the clothes he's got?

13
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:43,683
Where's he headed for
without any clothes?

14
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:45,604
Without even a toothbrush!

15
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:46,682
Nashville.

16
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:51,323
A letter fell out of his coat
while I was getting his clothes off.

17
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:54,086
I couldn't help but read
the first couple of lines.

18
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:59,090
It was from somebody asking him to come
and try out for the Grand Ole Opry.

19
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:00,608
The Grand Ole Opry?

20
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:02,968
But why didn't you say so sooner?

21
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:07,333
The letter, I really shouldn't have read it.

22
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:11,486
You shouldn't have, but as long as you did,
you might have let us read it, too.

23
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:16,643
My God almighty! The Grand Ole Opry!

24
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:21,171
If Mama was only alive today to see
what's become of her son now.

25
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:26,132
On second thought,
maybe it's just as well.

26
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:34,962
Ruined.

27
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,572
All ruined.

28
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:42,010
Well, you've been wanting
to go out to California.

29
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:46,684
But we should have gone before now,
like I wanted to.

30
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,324
Now we don't have anything.

31
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:52,486
Every penny we had
was tied up in this crop.

32
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:56,688
Whit!

33
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,288
Howard!

34
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:00,525
Marjorie, come on!

35
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:02,924
We got lots of work to do.

36
00:06:04,253 --> 00:06:05,925
Can I clean the car?

37
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:07,442
All right.

38
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:36,608
Hey! How the hell are you, Hoss?

39
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:39,969
Boy, put 'er there.
You're shooting up like a weed!

40
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:44,725
Thanks a lot for fixing that car.
Any serious damage?

41
00:06:45,293 --> 00:06:47,363
The oil pan's leaking a little.

42
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:49,923
Is it serious? Can I make it to Nashville?

43
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:52,049
So long you don't let it run out of oil.

44
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:55,170
It's true, then?
You're gonna sing at the Grand Ole Opry?

45
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:59,726
I'm afraid it's just an audition.
If that car gets me there in one piece.

46
00:06:59,813 --> 00:07:02,725
It seems to have a mind of its own
some of the time.

47
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:09,170
I wish your daddy would buy some
ready-made cigarettes.

48
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:14,931
Get me my guitar.

49
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,451
Dust-cutter.

50
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:36,531
Real panther piss.

51
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:39,765
- Here, you want some?
- No.

52
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:44,007
- The alcohol will kill the germs.
- It ain't that.

53
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:47,529
It's Mama. If she knew I took
a drink of whiskey, she'd have a hissy.

54
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:50,252
Well, what she don't know won't hurt her.

55
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:54,650
If you feel like getting up,
come have some eggs and biscuits...

56
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,564
and we'll get this bed made up.

57
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:59,167
You, come on, now. Let him get dressed.

58
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:01,928
Hoss?

59
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,611
Thanks again and mum's the word on this.

60
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:07,968
Of course.

61
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:10,692
Here's to us ducks,
because we don't give a quack.

62
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,570
If it don't rain, we'll walk.

63
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:32,167
Bubba! Don't drive so blamed fast.
We got plenty of time.

64
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:38,973
Bubba, be careful!

65
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:45,566
What're you trying to do, kill us all?
Can't you drive no better than that?

66
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:48,690
I ain't exactly at my best
when I got a fire under my ass.

67
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:52,652
You've been drinking, that's what it is.
Why don't you let somebody else drive?

68
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,166
I suppose you could drive better?

69
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:57,928
I'm sure any of us could.
Even Whit could drive better than that.

70
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,849
- That true, Hoss?
- Probably.

71
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:03,682
You wanna try?

72
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:05,968
Sure. Papa sometimes lets me
drive the truck.

73
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:07,930
All right, slide on over.

74
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:12,403
Bubba, why don't you let Virgil drive?

75
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:15,565
Hoss claims he can drive as good as me...

76
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:17,530
by God, I believe he can.

77
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:19,848
Come on, just slide on in there.

78
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:22,523
Now, we just ease right on out.

79
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:30,323
That's the way. Let the clutch out easy.

80
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:32,963
- Easy on the clutch.
- I know.

81
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:35,971
What do you say, folks?

82
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:38,648
Ain't Hoss doing a hell of a job driving?

83
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:48,406
I put every penny we had into that crop.

84
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:51,886
Borrowed all I could.

85
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:55,281
Can't think of anyplace to steal it...

86
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:58,372
and I'm not gonna beg. Ain't in me to beg.

87
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:00,444
There's a fellow over in Meeker...

88
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:03,525
who says he bought machinery and stock.

89
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:09,048
He'll give you a few cents on the dollar
for everything you got.

90
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:10,846
Maybe get $100.

91
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,083
That ain't gonna get us out to California...

92
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:15,482
keep us in grub till we find a job.

93
00:10:15,693 --> 00:10:17,923
Well, I could match you for the rest.

94
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:19,850
You? You ain't<i>...</i>

95
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:24,130
I thought you said
you didn't have any money.

96
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:25,487
You kidding?

97
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:27,769
I got money 10 miles up a bull's ass.

98
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:33,804
Of course, I gotta find that bull to get it.

99
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:36,612
I was thinking I'd send it to you
when I got to Nashville.

100
00:10:36,693 --> 00:10:39,207
- How you gonna get to Nashville?
- Tennessee.

101
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:42,324
I was born in Tennessee.

102
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:46,167
Cainsville, just north of Murfreesboro.

103
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,008
Came to Oklahoma when I was 18,
riding an old mule...

104
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:55,209
- and made the Run into Cherokee Strip.
- How about some more coffee?

105
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:58,046
That was in September 1893.

106
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:00,563
September 16th, to be exact.

107
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:05,568
- There was maybe...
- Whit, get on into bed.

108
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:07,884
I wanna hear Grandpa tell about the Run.

109
00:11:07,973 --> 00:11:11,283
People in hell be wanting ice-water.
Now get into bed like the others.

110
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:13,887
Please, can't I stay and hear Grandpa
tell about the Run?

111
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,407
Did you hear what I said, boy?
Get into bed!

112
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,966
Uncle Red? Tomorrow,
could I play your guitar?

113
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:25,008
Now!

114
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:32,691
Looks like you're raising
a musician there, sis.

115
00:11:33,213 --> 00:11:35,363
Maybe I should take him
to Nashville with me.

116
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:37,967
That's if I can get enough money
to get there.

117
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:42,407
I could give you maybe $30.

118
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:47,686
That's very nice, Mr. Wagoner,
but you'll need it to get to California.

119
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:50,724
Ain't going to California.

120
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:54,162
Too old for that. I've been thinking.

121
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:56,844
- I wanna go home.
- Home?

122
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,085
Why, your home is with us, Grandpa.

123
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:00,765
I mean Tennessee.

124
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,287
Ain't been back there for 45 years.

125
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:06,171
Was born there,
and that's where I wanna die.

126
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:10,845
I can give you maybe $30.

127
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:13,526
Can you drive a car?

128
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:16,011
Never learned how...

129
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,210
and I'm too old to start now.

130
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:24,168
Was always good with mules, though.

131
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:29,250
Rode one from Tennessee,
in fact, back in 1893.

132
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:33,403
- That was...
- How about some more coffee?

133
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:36,928
Pa?

134
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:40,092
No, thanks.

135
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:44,925
I'd better go to bed.

136
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:58,051
God damn it, either tune that thing,
or stop playing it!

137
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:59,532
I don't know how.

138
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,092
Bring it on in here!

139
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,332
Give me that.

140
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,086
I'll show you how to tune this thing
only one time...

141
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:16,209
so you will pay attention, you hear?

142
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:19,490
You hold this "E" string down here
at the fifth fret.

143
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:22,205
What're you staring at?

144
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,922
Is there something peculiar about
the way I look?

145
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:29,131
Get out of here! Standing around here,
staring at me like I'm a freak!

146
00:13:30,053 --> 00:13:31,771
Get out of here! Beat it!

147
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,205
Get away from me.

148
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:55,167
Listen, honey, it's not your fault.

149
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:58,686
It's the sickness
that makes him talk like that.

150
00:13:59,493 --> 00:14:02,246
You can't blame him.
It's not his fault, either.

151
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:06,532
You can't blame him no more than you
could blame a cripple man for hobbling.

152
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:09,447
- You understand?
- I guess so.

153
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:12,166
He's only human.

154
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:14,248
Come on, now.

155
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:18,087
I'm gonna fix him something to eat,
and I want you to take it in to him.

156
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,603
Me? What if he don't want it?

157
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,090
You tell him he'd better eat it...

158
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:25,403
or I'll go in there
and shove it down his throat.

159
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:27,290
She said that, did she?

160
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:29,927
Well, I guess, in that case I'd better try.

161
00:14:34,893 --> 00:14:35,962
Look, Hoss.

162
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:40,930
Don't you go paying attention to me
when I get like this.

163
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,571
It's the damn fever.

164
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:47,083
When it comes on, it makes me snappish
as a pair of sheep shears.

165
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:48,812
That's okay.

166
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:52,846
Get that guitar.

167
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:57,562
You play it, I'll show you how to tune it.

168
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:02,367
Hold the "E" string down
on the fifth fret right there at the top.

169
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:04,841
That's the way.

170
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:08,602
Play the "E" string
and the "A" string open.

171
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:19,172
Now, listen.
The only reason we're letting you go is...

172
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,721
I want you to keep him out of trouble,
if you can.

173
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:25,089
Don't let him drink while he's driving<i>...</i>
Listen now.

174
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:28,609
You have to promise me
you won't go in that honkytonk, you hear?

175
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:32,732
- But I wanted to hear Uncle Red sing!
- You'll just have to listen from outside.

176
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:35,964
You have to promise me that,
or I won't let you go.

177
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:40,402
All right. You'd think I was a little kid,
or something.

178
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:43,769
Uncle Red was playing in honkytonks
by the time he was my age.

179
00:16:14,653 --> 00:16:16,644
I'll have some chickens for you
in the morning.

180
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:20,123
Well, look here! What's this, Red?
Got yourself a helper?

181
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,285
This is my nephew, Whit.
This is Lulu, she owns the joint.

182
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:27,128
Nephew! Ain't he something, now?
Sure is cute, ain't he?

183
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:29,131
And he gets it all from me.

184
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:31,886
Well, you should have kept some
for yourself.

185
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:35,124
I like them young, and that's a fact,
but not that young.

186
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:39,047
How about if I give you a nickel,
and you call me up in a couple of years?

187
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:42,930
- What do you think about that, Hoss?
- Here you are, hon.

188
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:44,651
You can spend it now if you want...

189
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:47,531
but you gotta remember to call me
in a couple of years.

190
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:49,205
Go ahead, take it.

191
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:51,410
- Thank you, ma'am.
- You're welcome.

192
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:52,812
Sing good, Red.

193
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:55,281
I'll try.

194
00:16:57,253 --> 00:16:59,050
A Nehi orange, please?

195
00:19:10,573 --> 00:19:11,801
<i>Thank you.</i>

196
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:17,209
<i>I'm Red Stovall and I'm here</i>
<i>to do a few songs for you...</i>

197
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,803
<i>and pass the hat.</i>
<i>So you got any requests...</i>

198
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,611
<i>just sound them out.</i>

199
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:28,527
Let's go, Hoss.

200
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:30,968
Sure you gotta go, Red?
I've got a room out back.

201
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,442
The boy could sleep in the car,
couldn't he?

202
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,843
I've got some more business to do tonight.

203
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:39,846
But I'll be back tomorrow night.
Come on, Hoss.

204
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:41,889
Let's get the show on the road.

205
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:44,611
Keep it warm for me.

206
00:19:58,253 --> 00:20:00,642
- You got the board?
- Yeah, I got it.

207
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,923
What's the matter with you? You're
shaking like a dog shitting peach pits.

208
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:10,686
- Lf Mama knew what we was doing<i>...</i>
- She won't...

209
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:12,445
unless you tell her.

210
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,603
She might have to come
and identify our bodies...

211
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:18,208
- once those chickens start squawking.
- There won't be any squawking.

212
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:20,333
- The sacks are getting full.
- How many we got?

213
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,881
Maybe 40 or 50. Enough.
Let's get outta here...

214
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:25,487
- while the getting's good.
- I'll get one more.

215
00:21:38,653 --> 00:21:40,325
Let's get outta here!

216
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:48,089
What's going on out there?

217
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:55,646
Stop, thief, or I'll blow your ass off!

218
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:07,046
Damn, Hoss, we made it.

219
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:10,728
For a moment, I thought those dogs were
gonna make hamburger out of my ass.

220
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:13,122
Here, have a drink. You deserve it.

221
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:18,247
Strong, ain't it?

222
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:53,483
Eyes are bigger than my stomach.

223
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:11,365
I'll meet you back at the car.

224
00:23:11,453 --> 00:23:12,966
Where are you going?

225
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:15,124
Get myself some new duds.

226
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:18,883
Here's $5. That seem about right
for your share?

227
00:23:20,173 --> 00:23:22,323
For me? Five whole dollars?

228
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:25,963
Don't spend it all in one place.

229
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:34,085
Got a call last night about a car
like the one here.

230
00:23:34,253 --> 00:23:38,326
Man over in Roscoe
said somebody in a late-model limousine...

231
00:23:38,413 --> 00:23:40,449
stole some of his chickens.

232
00:23:41,773 --> 00:23:44,003
Of course, I didn't believe him.

233
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:45,602
But then...

234
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:48,606
me and Jim Bob here
was driving down the street...

235
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:53,012
and I said to Jim Bob, I says,
"God durn, Jim Bob...

236
00:23:53,093 --> 00:23:55,209
"look at that big old car there.

237
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:58,287
"I'll just bet that that's the feller...

238
00:23:58,373 --> 00:24:01,604
"who stole them chickens
over in Roscoe last night."

239
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:05,803
Ain't that what I said, Jim Bob?

240
00:24:06,253 --> 00:24:09,404
That's it, Snuffy.
That's what you said, all right.

241
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:12,532
Looky here.

242
00:24:14,493 --> 00:24:17,326
That a chicken feather, or ain't it?

243
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:21,362
Looks like a chicken feather to me, Snuff.

244
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:24,008
And that stuff on the seat, Jim Bob...

245
00:24:24,093 --> 00:24:26,209
what do you reckon that stuff is?

246
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:30,168
Looks like chicken shit to me, Snuffy.

247
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:32,251
- You think so?
- I'd swear to it.

248
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:35,052
I seen enough chicken shit in my life
to know...

249
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,167
when I see it.

250
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:42,291
When was the last time
you saw chicken shit, Jim Bob?

251
00:24:42,373 --> 00:24:45,490
- When you were shaving this morning?
- Jim Bob!

252
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:50,327
Smart ass, ain't you?

253
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:55,652
Jim Bob, what do you reckon we'd find...

254
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:59,965
if you was to reach in under that seat
and feel around a little?

255
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:11,004
My, what have we got here?

256
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:13,412
Bootleg whiskey.

257
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:18,570
We're gonna have to take you down
to the courthouse...

258
00:25:18,653 --> 00:25:22,362
to see if you can explain how all this stuff
come to be in your car.

259
00:25:23,653 --> 00:25:25,086
It ain't my car.

260
00:25:26,453 --> 00:25:28,648
You hear that, Jim Bob?

261
00:25:29,773 --> 00:25:31,764
He says it ain't his car.

262
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:39,728
He was just sitting here,
waiting for the owner to come back.

263
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:41,932
That's right.

264
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:44,605
Frisk him and cuff him.

265
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:47,366
Put your hands up there.
Spread your legs.

266
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:52,727
No keys.

267
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:56,328
This give you a thrill, Jim Bob?
Groping a man's crotch like that?

268
00:26:05,493 --> 00:26:06,972
Put it away.

269
00:26:08,573 --> 00:26:10,325
Put the cuffs on him.

270
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:15,602
We'll come back for the car later.

271
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:19,049
Somebody might drive it away.

272
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:20,612
The owner?

273
00:26:21,293 --> 00:26:23,204
He might get surprised...

274
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:26,251
if he finds somebody here waiting for him.

275
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:11,371
Uncle Red! Get ready.

276
00:27:58,053 --> 00:27:59,964
Hurry, Uncle Red! Hurry!

277
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:08,089
Come on, get outta here, Hoss!

278
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:17,971
God damn!

279
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:31,892
You did it, Hoss!
Damned if you didn't do it.

280
00:28:35,493 --> 00:28:36,812
Should I stop?

281
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:45,488
Damn!

282
00:28:53,573 --> 00:28:56,690
Where in the double-damn tarnation
have you two been?

283
00:28:56,773 --> 00:29:00,209
We had a little car trouble in Tallapoosa.
Had to stay over.

284
00:29:00,293 --> 00:29:02,523
We've been worried to death!
Why didn't you<i>...</i>

285
00:29:02,613 --> 00:29:04,251
Bubba! Are you all right?

286
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:07,245
Just a little chill.
A cup of your hot java will fix me up.

287
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,530
What you need is a long rest in bed.
I'm gonna see that you get it.

288
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:12,683
I've gotta head out for Nashville
in the morning.

289
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:14,172
So soon? Why?

290
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,846
If you're serious about going,
Mr. Wagoner...

291
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:27,527
that $30 of yours will get us to Tulsa.

292
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,567
And there's a fellow there
who owes me some money.

293
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:32,848
I think that'll get us the rest of the way.

294
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:35,367
I'll be ready to go in the morning.

295
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:38,169
Just one other thing, sis.

296
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:42,449
I'd appreciate you considering
us taking Hoss along.

297
00:29:43,493 --> 00:29:47,088
I need a driver, and he's a real good one.
One of the best I've seen.

298
00:29:47,373 --> 00:29:48,522
Real safe and everything.

299
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:54,167
It ain't just that.
I think the boy's got talent.

300
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,642
I could teach him to play a little guitar.

301
00:29:57,733 --> 00:30:00,406
Maybe he'd be a singer someday.
Maybe a good singer.

302
00:30:00,613 --> 00:30:03,923
What do you think, Hoss?
You'd like to go to Nashville with me?

303
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,971
Bubba, he's too young
for anything like that.

304
00:30:09,813 --> 00:30:13,442
- Please! Please let me go with him!
- You hush up.

305
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:19,528
Well, it's entirely up to you all.

306
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:27,011
If we get out to California
in time for picking cotton...

307
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:29,049
we're gonna need every hand we can get.

308
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:31,283
Papa, please let me go with him!

309
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,768
You heard him. He said I had talent.

310
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:36,772
- I could be a musician...
- I told you to hush up!

311
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:40,203
Papa, I don't want to be
a damned cotton picker all my life!

312
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:45,132
So Mr. Big Britches don't want to be
a damned cotton picker all his life!

313
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:48,929
If your mama and I hadn't been
picking cotton all them years...

314
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,844
working our fingers to the bone for you...

315
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,811
where the hell would you be today,
Mr. Big Britches?

316
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,963
Papa, it ain't like that.
I just want a chance to be somebody.

317
00:30:59,053 --> 00:31:01,567
You go to bed this minute! Right now!

318
00:31:04,293 --> 00:31:06,045
- But he said...
- Go to bed!

319
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:12,722
We'll talk about it in the morning.
But if I hear one more word out of you...

320
00:31:12,813 --> 00:31:15,532
just one more, then you won't go at all.

321
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:17,412
And that's final.

322
00:31:30,213 --> 00:31:32,204
Please, Mama. Let me go with him.

323
00:31:32,293 --> 00:31:33,772
I don't want you to.

324
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:36,368
But...

325
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:40,603
I don't want him to go alone.

326
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:43,568
You know he's very sick, don't you?

327
00:31:43,813 --> 00:31:47,806
He shouldn't be going anywhere
by himself, unless it was to a sanitarium.

328
00:31:47,893 --> 00:31:51,044
There probably wouldn't be anybody
to call a doctor for him if he<i>...</i>

329
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:53,567
- I could take care of him.
- Can you?

330
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:57,131
I know it's a lot to ask of a boy your age...

331
00:31:57,693 --> 00:32:00,605
but it seems like
you're the best friend he's got.

332
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:03,844
But do you have any idea
what it'll be like if he<i>...</i>

333
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:08,842
All right, then.

334
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:11,493
But only if you promise me two things:

335
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,688
That you won't drink,
and that you'll come home...

336
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:17,651
soon as we get settled
out in California. Promise?

337
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:21,482
- Cross my heart and hope to die.
- And try to bring Bubba back with you?

338
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:22,528
Yes ma'am, I sure will.

339
00:32:22,613 --> 00:32:25,207
Be sure and write to us once in a while
at Bud and Dora's...

340
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:27,045
and let us know
how you and him are doing.

341
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:29,044
- I promise.
- All right, then.

342
00:32:30,493 --> 00:32:32,211
You bring the wood in.

343
00:32:32,373 --> 00:32:34,648
Breakfast will be ready in a minute...

344
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:37,367
then I'll help you pack your things.

345
00:32:41,013 --> 00:32:44,562
Holy shit! I'm going to Nashville!

346
00:33:04,493 --> 00:33:05,972
Here's our route, Hoss.

347
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:09,170
We just skirt right around Roscoe
and head straight on out to Enid.

348
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,051
Enid? Ain't we going through Tallapoosa?

349
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:14,765
Long way out of the way.

350
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:17,447
Don't worry, Mr. Wagoner.
We'll make it to Tulsa, all right.

351
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:20,525
When we do,
we'll look up Mr. Durwood Arnspringer.

352
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:22,252
Mr. Who?

353
00:33:22,613 --> 00:33:24,490
Fellow owes me some money.

354
00:33:24,573 --> 00:33:26,848
Wake me, Hoss, when we get to Enid.

355
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,532
- All right, we're getting close.
- Close to what?

356
00:33:43,613 --> 00:33:46,081
This is where it happened. Pull over.

357
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:53,126
The Hennessy Line ran right along
over there.

358
00:33:53,973 --> 00:33:56,806
Stretching from horizon to horizon.

359
00:33:57,293 --> 00:34:01,047
- What're you talking about, Grandpa?
- The Run! It was the Run, boy.

360
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:04,410
When they opened the Cherokee Strip
to white settlers.

361
00:34:04,493 --> 00:34:06,404
September 16, 1893.

362
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:08,964
This is where it happened?

363
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:12,491
The Hennessy Line ran along
right over there.

364
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:15,406
People lined up as far as you could see.

365
00:34:15,493 --> 00:34:17,848
Thousands and thousands of people.

366
00:34:18,013 --> 00:34:21,642
Men, women, kids. All ages. All kinds.

367
00:34:22,413 --> 00:34:26,725
On horses and mules,
in wagons, buckboards, surreys<i>...</i>

368
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,489
Some of them on foot. Lots of them.

369
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:31,612
Where were you?

370
00:34:35,853 --> 00:34:38,492
See that hump in that ridge over yonder?

371
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:41,368
That's where I was, near about.

372
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:44,091
I was 18 then...

373
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:47,171
set in the saddle of an old mule,
an old saddle.

374
00:34:47,893 --> 00:34:50,771
I rode that old mule
all the way from Tennessee.

375
00:34:50,893 --> 00:34:54,727
I got him here three days before the Run,
so I could rest him up.

376
00:34:56,813 --> 00:35:00,567
It was the greatest horse race
in the history of the world, boy...

377
00:35:01,093 --> 00:35:02,970
and for the greatest prize...

378
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,405
the Cherokee Strip.

379
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:24,851
Did you get some of it?

380
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:29,408
Yeah, I got mine. I lost it later.
But, hell, that don't matter.

381
00:35:30,013 --> 00:35:34,165
It wasn't just the land,
the dirt itself that I was racing for.

382
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,330
It was the Promised Land.

383
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:41,482
That's what you got to understand.

384
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:45,802
That's what I try to make
people understand. It wasn't just the land.

385
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:48,486
It was the dream.

386
00:36:01,213 --> 00:36:02,931
That's what I tell them.

387
00:36:04,573 --> 00:36:06,962
We wasn't just land chasers, Whit.

388
00:36:07,173 --> 00:36:10,290
We was dream chasers.

389
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:22,285
Just look at it now.

390
00:36:22,373 --> 00:36:23,931
All turned to dust.

391
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,528
We ruined it, Whit, we ruined it.

392
00:36:33,813 --> 00:36:36,532
But there's other places. California, now.

393
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:39,448
They say that's the Promised Land, too.

394
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:42,252
No. Too old to go chasing another dream.

395
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:46,281
Holy shit!

396
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:51,931
The only dream I got is going home.

397
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:54,004
Help! Do something, somebody!

398
00:36:55,893 --> 00:36:57,212
Son of a bitch!

399
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:10,811
- I'm going over.
- You know what you're doing, boy?

400
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:13,202
No. If I did, I wouldn't be doing it.

401
00:37:25,853 --> 00:37:28,048
That's the way, Hoss. Keep him busy.

402
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:45,971
That's the way, Hoss.

403
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:48,006
Keep him busy!

404
00:37:57,773 --> 00:37:58,762
Bitch!

405
00:38:18,573 --> 00:38:21,087
What's so damned funny?
That was my new shirt.

406
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,050
When you was climbing that ladder...

407
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:25,647
that bull's horn missed your asshole
that far.

408
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:35,205
I don't need a bath for a while,
that's for sure.

409
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,882
<i>And I know we both feel</i>
<i>that we have been had</i>

410
00:38:56,973 --> 00:38:59,612
That's good, Hoss.
I'm gonna write that down.

411
00:39:02,013 --> 00:39:03,128
That's good.

412
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:34,130
<i>Well, I got my guitar</i>

413
00:39:38,653 --> 00:39:41,087
That's really good, Hoss.
You've got it now.

414
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:53,405
<i>Throw your arms around</i>
<i>this honkytonk man</i>

415
00:39:53,493 --> 00:39:54,687
How's that?

416
00:39:56,053 --> 00:39:59,329
Damn, boy! You've got
this songwriting stuff down.

417
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:00,926
Hey, how about that?

418
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:25,129
They don't know where the fellow is.

419
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:27,329
Or if they do, they're not talking.

420
00:40:27,853 --> 00:40:30,048
Do you reckon we'll ever find him?

421
00:40:30,453 --> 00:40:31,647
I don't know.

422
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:39,085
Hey, he might know.

423
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:41,764
- Who?
- Bob Wills.

424
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:45,844
Let's go to this radio station.
Go up here and turn right.

425
00:40:46,253 --> 00:40:49,086
Why don't you fellows drop me off
at a motor court?

426
00:40:51,093 --> 00:40:52,287
You know Bob Wills?

427
00:40:52,373 --> 00:40:55,285
Your Uncle Red wrote this tune
they're doing right now.

428
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:21,525
What're you doing in these parts?

429
00:42:21,613 --> 00:42:23,763
I'm just traveling through
on my way to Nashville.

430
00:42:23,853 --> 00:42:26,572
- I've got a try-out on the Opry.
- That ought to do it for you.

431
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:28,644
The way you write songs and sing<i>...</i>

432
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:30,724
How'd you like the way
we've done your song?

433
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:32,644
It's a lot better than I've ever done it.

434
00:42:32,733 --> 00:42:35,486
We've been playing this some on dances,
the crowds love it...

435
00:42:35,573 --> 00:42:39,725
and all the guys in the band like it.
We'd like to record it in Dallas next week.

436
00:42:40,013 --> 00:42:43,403
- Fantastic, I could sure use the dough, too.
- All right!

437
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,972
This is my nephew, Whit.
I believe he wants to meet you.

438
00:42:47,053 --> 00:42:48,805
Hey, Whit, how're you doing?

439
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:51,488
- Don't talk, does he?
- No, he sings pretty good.

440
00:42:51,573 --> 00:42:53,768
At least, I think he will
when his voice changes.

441
00:42:53,853 --> 00:42:56,811
That's great. Well listen,
good luck on the Opry.

442
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:02,608
I might not get to Nashville at all,
unless I can find Durwood Arnspringer.

443
00:43:02,693 --> 00:43:05,287
Used to book some shows.
Do you know him?

444
00:43:05,373 --> 00:43:07,568
I know him. Does he owe you money?

445
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:10,804
He wrote me a rubber check
for a thing I did for him a few years back.

446
00:43:10,893 --> 00:43:11,848
Look...

447
00:43:12,653 --> 00:43:16,282
I know where you might find him.
You remember Miss Maud's cathouse...

448
00:43:18,253 --> 00:43:21,086
Miss Maud's place?
He hangs around there a lot.

449
00:43:21,173 --> 00:43:23,641
Why don't you go by
and tell her you're a friend of mine?

450
00:43:23,733 --> 00:43:25,530
All right, I'll do that.

451
00:43:25,613 --> 00:43:26,932
Hey, wait...

452
00:43:27,573 --> 00:43:30,133
if Durwood don't come through
with the money, could I help?

453
00:43:30,213 --> 00:43:32,522
I'll get it out of him.
Don't worry about that.

454
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:34,604
Good luck to you. See you, Whit.

455
00:43:47,093 --> 00:43:48,685
A real whorehouse?

456
00:43:53,653 --> 00:43:56,850
Howdy. I'm looking
for a Mr. Durwood Arnspringer.

457
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:59,242
Bob Wills said you might know
where he is.

458
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:01,130
You a friend of Bob's?

459
00:44:04,733 --> 00:44:09,170
I've done business with Arnspringer
on occasion.

460
00:44:11,413 --> 00:44:14,530
He's got a card game going
back at the Choo-Choo Cafe nights.

461
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:17,366
That's all I know.
Down by the railroad tracks.

462
00:44:17,453 --> 00:44:20,525
Down by the railroad tracks?
I'm much obliged, ma'am.

463
00:44:21,933 --> 00:44:23,048
Say...

464
00:44:24,173 --> 00:44:25,492
as long as we're here...

465
00:44:25,573 --> 00:44:27,962
my son here, he's 16.

466
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,723
He ain't never been with a woman,
and I'm getting worried about him.

467
00:44:32,813 --> 00:44:36,089
You think maybe we could fix him up
before he gets pimples?

468
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,289
We don't take no kids here, cowboy.

469
00:44:38,373 --> 00:44:41,046
We got enough trouble with the cops
without that.

470
00:44:41,693 --> 00:44:44,526
I'm his daddy, I'll take the responsibility.

471
00:44:44,853 --> 00:44:47,367
None of the girls here would take him.

472
00:44:51,493 --> 00:44:53,529
What're you staring at, kid?

473
00:44:54,013 --> 00:44:56,004
I told you I'd take the responsibility.

474
00:44:56,213 --> 00:44:57,202
You.

475
00:44:58,293 --> 00:44:59,282
Why?

476
00:44:59,493 --> 00:45:02,610
It wouldn't be you or the boy
that'd get arrested if the cops come.

477
00:45:02,693 --> 00:45:05,161
It would be the girl with him,
besides myself, of course.

478
00:45:05,253 --> 00:45:06,971
That's why won't none of them take him.

479
00:45:07,453 --> 00:45:09,205
Because you're so beautiful.

480
00:45:11,173 --> 00:45:15,132
It's a sad state when a man
can't buy a woman for his own boy.

481
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:17,683
Miss Maud, I'll take him.

482
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:21,244
Well, it's your risk, I reckon.

483
00:45:23,293 --> 00:45:25,488
Would you like to come with me?

484
00:45:25,573 --> 00:45:27,291
That'll be $2, then.

485
00:45:28,253 --> 00:45:30,448
And if you want a girl, too<i>...</i>

486
00:45:31,493 --> 00:45:32,892
Well, I just might.

487
00:45:32,973 --> 00:45:35,362
Got anything around here
built for comfort?

488
00:45:35,453 --> 00:45:37,569
Honey, I think we could accommodate you.

489
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:48,691
- Kind of robbing the cradle, ain't you?
- Shut up.

490
00:45:54,493 --> 00:45:55,642
Come on over.

491
00:45:55,733 --> 00:45:58,327
Take your pants off and
I'll wash you up, okay?

492
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,527
That's okay.

493
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:14,528
We'll just try again in a few minutes.

494
00:46:26,173 --> 00:46:28,084
Well, how'd you like it?

495
00:46:31,933 --> 00:46:34,208
What's the matter, cat got your tongue?

496
00:46:34,733 --> 00:46:36,052
I love you.

497
00:46:55,853 --> 00:46:57,844
Well, Hoss, how was that?

498
00:46:57,973 --> 00:47:01,761
That's exactly the way your old Uncle Red
felt after the first time.

499
00:47:30,053 --> 00:47:32,567
- Yes?
- Durwood Arnspringer around here?

500
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:34,167
Mr. Arnspringer?

501
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:36,002
He's taking a nap.

502
00:47:36,093 --> 00:47:39,927
Why don't you wake him up? Tell him
Red Stovall wants to say hello to him.

503
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:08,805
Well, as I live and breathe!
It's not Red Stovall!

504
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:11,527
I've had occasion to wonder
what happened to you, Red.

505
00:48:11,613 --> 00:48:12,932
It's been years!

506
00:48:13,613 --> 00:48:16,764
I've had occasion to wonder
about you too, Durwood.

507
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:20,889
Get this shit out of here!

508
00:48:20,973 --> 00:48:24,761
You should have been done hours ago!
I got players coming here soon!

509
00:48:29,933 --> 00:48:31,491
So here you are!

510
00:48:32,973 --> 00:48:34,850
What's happened to you, boy?

511
00:48:35,533 --> 00:48:38,445
You don't look too well.
They working you to death?

512
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:39,966
I'm doing all right.

513
00:48:40,053 --> 00:48:41,611
I got myself a spot on the Opry.

514
00:48:41,693 --> 00:48:44,651
The Grand Ole Opry?
By God, that'll put you on top, boy.

515
00:48:44,733 --> 00:48:47,372
I could sure use that $100 you owe me.

516
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:51,682
I'm sorry, Red, I really am.
But this depression, you know.

517
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:55,052
- How about a drink?
- I just want my money.

518
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,922
Red, I told you, I haven't got it.

519
00:48:58,613 --> 00:49:00,410
- Well, get it.
- I can't!

520
00:49:01,213 --> 00:49:03,329
I'm disappointed in you, Red.

521
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:07,082
Questioning my honesty like this.
Is that what you're doing?

522
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,803
Calling me a liar and a cheat?

523
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:15,765
I'm calling you a liar and a cheat,
and a fat, porky, son of a bitch!

524
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:19,568
You wanna hear any more?
I got other things I can think up for you.

525
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:31,240
I think I know how we can square it.

526
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,604
That girl? The one who was just in here?

527
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:37,600
I'll tell you what I'll do, Red.

528
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:40,643
I'll give you her and we'll call it even.

529
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:45,284
You'd give me that girl
for the $100 you owe me?

530
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,725
Yeah, why don't you talk to her yourself?

531
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:51,166
Marlene, get yourself down here, honey!

532
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:01,084
Marlene, this here is Red Stovall.

533
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,081
He's a singer, and a damned good one.

534
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,320
How'd you like to go to Nashville
with him?

535
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,878
- You'd be a good girl, wouldn't you?
- Nashville!

536
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:10,848
My goodness, Nashville!
That is my heart's dream!

537
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:13,320
I would just do anything to go!

538
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,758
Well, there you are. Just take her
a few minutes to get her stuff packed.

539
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:20,567
It won't do, Arnspringer.

540
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,121
Please take me with you, Mr. Stovall.

541
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:26,282
I won't be any trouble, I promise.
It would mean so much to me.

542
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,883
The Lord will bless you if you do.

543
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:31,724
I've dreamed of going to Nashville
and becoming a singing star.

544
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:34,688
And I'm good, too!
The Lord has given me a great talent.

545
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:38,445
- Just ask anybody who's heard me.
- She's a mighty good singer, Red.

546
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:39,883
It won't do.

547
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:44,406
Please, Mr. Stovall! I beg of you, please...

548
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:46,765
Can't you see he don't want you?

549
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:49,398
Now go on.
Go get me some coffee and doughnuts.

550
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:52,607
- You want coffee and doughnuts, Red?
- I just want my money.

551
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:54,079
My heart is broken.

552
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:58,686
Your ass is going to be broken, too,
if you don't get me the coffee.

553
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,687
Now, look here, Red.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

554
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:07,080
I'll show you how white I am.

555
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:10,408
I'll show you how you can make that $100
in no time at all.

556
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:12,321
That's the best I can do.

557
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:16,207
- I'm listening.
- Well, the deal is this:

558
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:21,043
I do a little service
for some of my business friends...

559
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:23,724
in the community here from time to time.

560
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,602
Mostly, insurance jobs.

561
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,648
Somebody wants something stolen,
I make sure it gets stolen.

562
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:29,799
It's really a set-up.

563
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,358
You just walk in
and tell the woman it's a stickup.

564
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,089
She hands you $100, maybe a little more.

565
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:38,760
- Where's my coffee and doughnuts?
- Junior's bringing it.

566
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:44,000
- Well, what do you say, Red?
- This woman, what does she get out of it?

567
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:46,320
That's where the trick is, see?

568
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,247
She gives the robber $100...

569
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:51,128
but she tells the insurance company
it was $200.

570
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,241
And the place, where is it?

571
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:56,527
It's Myrtle's Diner,
out west of town on the highway.

572
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,807
- But you said I could.
- I know what I said, Junior.

573
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,446
You see what I'm doing for you?

574
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:05,328
Something's come up now.
I've gotta give Red the job.

575
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:09,847
- But you said<i>...</i>
- I know what I said, God damn it!

576
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,481
I know what I'm saying now!

577
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:19,759
Well?

578
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,560
All right. We'll need a gun.
We've gotta make it look real.

579
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:27,799
Marlene!

580
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:31,326
Bring that old shotgun down here,
and don't be all day about it!

581
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:35,403
This Myrtle...

582
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,359
- she got a phone?
- No. Why?

583
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:41,527
I thought I'd give her a call,
see if this is all on the level.

584
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:45,125
For pity's sake, Red!
Why would I lie to you?

585
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:50,120
What are you standing around here for?

586
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:53,682
What do you say, Red?

587
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:57,725
I'll tell her you're coming tonight
about closing time. Right?

588
00:52:58,650 --> 00:52:59,765
Right.

589
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:21,525
Howdy.

590
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,923
We're closed.

591
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:28,566
Well, I'll just hang around here...

592
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,959
till you finish counting that cash.

593
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:50,607
Hey! It's me! I'm the one<i>...</i>
Arnspringer sent me.

594
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,285
Don't you go! Stay here!

595
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:45,123
Are you crazy?

596
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:52,682
Will you shut up? I'm the one
who's supposed to pull the hold-up.

597
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,169
Arnspringer sent me.

598
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,881
Look, it isn't even loaded.

599
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:11,721
You almost got yourself killed!
That's some set-up.

600
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:15,204
- Let's go back to Arnspringer's.
- What for?

601
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,880
I'm gonna get that money he owes me.

602
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,685
But that'll just mean more trouble.
Why don't we...

603
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:22,681
Damn it, Hoss, do what I tell you.

604
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:26,319
If you're with me, you're with me,
if you ain't, get out of the car!

605
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:32,924
Who is it?

606
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,728
Tell him it's Western Union.

607
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:37,563
Western Union.
Telegram for Mr. Arnspringer.

608
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,959
Just back right on over there, boy.

609
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:54,530
Everybody just keep their hands
right on the table.

610
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:57,727
- Red, what is this? What the hell?
- You son of a bitch!

611
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,766
You damn near got me killed.

612
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:02,364
- Red, I<i>...</i>
- You didn't tell that old lady I was coming.

613
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:03,803
She took a shot at me.

614
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:06,450
Red, I did! I didn't personally...

615
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,646
but I sent word.

616
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:11,079
What would I get
out of double-crossing you, Red?

617
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,683
How did you send word?

618
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:16,967
I sent somebody else.

619
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:20,682
You shit-for-brains.

620
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:24,685
All right, so you're an honest man.

621
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:27,079
Of course, I am, Red. You know me.

622
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:28,889
Yeah, I know you.

623
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:32,201
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.
You're gonna give me the $100...

624
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:35,805
and because you're such an honest man,
you're gonna toss in another $100...

625
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:37,881
'cause you almost got me killed.

626
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,407
Well, for one thing, Red,
I don't have the money.

627
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:46,083
And for another thing, I don't think
you have any shells in that shotgun.

628
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:48,164
You wanna bet?

629
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:57,527
Red, I don't have $200.

630
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,647
I don't even have $100.

631
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:03,325
- How much you got there?
- Maybe $50, $60.

632
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:08,883
- How about in there?
- That's not mine, that's the bank's.

633
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:11,609
Hoss, you take a look in that box there.

634
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,408
You take out $60 for Durwood, here.

635
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:26,680
And then we'll take out $50
for this gentleman right here.

636
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:29,600
Arnspringer, you can give him an IOU.

637
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,203
Red, you're going too far!

638
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:34,407
I don't know if you know this,
but I pay the police for protection.

639
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:36,765
Do it! Don't be a damned fool!

640
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:41,281
That's all the money I got.

641
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:45,048
You sure came to the right place
to spend it.

642
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:48,809
You're in big trouble, cowboy.
You know who I am?

643
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,768
Yeah, I know who you are.

644
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,526
You're the man with all the chips.

645
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,885
Take out $90 for this gentleman.

646
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:58,245
Durwood, you'll write him an IOU.

647
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:06,765
There, Red, she's gonna go
for the cops now.

648
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:10,365
But it's not too late!
It's not, if you'll stop this right now!

649
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:14,489
We won't prefer charges against you.
Will we, men? No, we'll forget all about it.

650
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:28,599
You ain't too smart, are you, boy?

651
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:32,879
Hoss, we got our money, let's go.

652
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,089
You men got your IOUs...

653
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:37,400
you can continue
on your poker game now.

654
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,965
The first one that looks out
before we're gone...

655
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,326
is gonna find out if I've got my shells
for my shotgun.

656
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:05,406
You stay here. I'll be right back.

657
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,764
Holy shit!

658
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,283
- What are you doing here?
- Will you help me, please?

659
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:26,088
I have to go with him to Nashville.

660
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,923
Would you please help
talk him into letting me go?

661
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,523
Are you crazy?

662
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:33,044
You know what he'll do
when he comes out and finds you?

663
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:36,122
But I can't go back to Arnspringer's!
I can't!

664
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,924
I didn't run out and get the cops, did I?

665
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,399
Arnspringer knows I didn't.
He's gonna skin me alive.

666
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:44,401
He'll never stand for it.

667
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,885
Put me in the trunk, then! Please?

668
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:53,647
I'll ride in there as far as I can
without being discovered.

669
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:56,164
Maybe by then we'll be far enough away
so he won't<i>...</i>

670
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,488
I just can't go back there!

671
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:01,926
You gonna be able to stand being shut up
in a place that small?

672
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:05,798
I can stand anything, as long as
I get to go to Nashville with him.

673
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:11,883
- What's the matter with Grandpa?
- He's drunk.

674
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:14,246
I, sir, am not drunk!

675
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,766
You, sir, rudely woke me.

676
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:20,327
I left a bottle of whiskey in there,
and he's drunk over half of it.

677
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:24,005
I assumed, sir,
that bottle was left there for me.

678
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,600
You ride in the back, Mr. Wagoner.
That way you can sleep it off.

679
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:33,205
No, sir. The back seat is yours.
This is your car.

680
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:36,558
Besides, you need the sleep
more than I do.

681
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:38,720
I ain't gonna argue with you.

682
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:13,440
Sorry to bother you,
but I have to go pee. Is he<i>...</i>

683
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:14,964
Sleeping.

684
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,282
You all right in there?

685
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:21,164
It's a sore trial, I can tell you...

686
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:24,880
but if that's what it takes to be with him,
it's not for me to complain.

687
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:28,007
With him? I thought you were just trying
to get to Nashville.

688
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:31,366
Yes, my heart is set on Nashville.

689
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:35,159
That's where I wanted to go even
before I met him. Now I have to go.

690
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:37,320
See, it's just this feeling I have...

691
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:39,765
that somehow our destinies
will be intertwined...

692
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:41,442
his and mine, like vines.

693
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:43,525
Vines?

694
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:50,605
I don't expect you'd understand
what I mean. It's just that...

695
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:54,245
when I saw him, something happened,
and I knew.

696
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:03,763
Look, if I was you, I wouldn't mention
anything about that...

697
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:06,410
"intertwined destinies" stuff to Uncle Red.

698
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:09,846
It wouldn't make your chances
of getting to Nashville any better.

699
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:11,889
Thank you.

700
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:17,448
I sure do appreciate
what you're doing for me.

701
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:19,203
What's your name?

702
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,407
Uncle Red calls me Hoss.

703
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:26,848
Do you mind very much
if I call you Hoss, too?

704
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:29,923
I'm Marlene. Marlene Moonglow.

705
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:35,926
Well, it's not my real name.

706
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:38,604
Real name's Mooney,
but Marlene Mooney<i>...</i>

707
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:41,682
It's just too plain for a singing star,
don't you think?

708
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:43,442
But, Moonglow<i>...</i>

709
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:47,925
Marlene Moonglow. Don't you think
that's a wonderful stage name?

710
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:52,763
I think you'd better get back in the car.

711
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,966
You've gotta get back inside.

712
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,203
What's that sound?

713
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:21,644
It's the rear end.

714
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:25,803
We're gonna have to stop in Fayetteville,
and get a mechanic to check on it.

715
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:29,039
Oh, God.

716
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:32,998
Just pull over here and stop, Hoss.
Don't worry about a thing.

717
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:36,845
- I'll take care of everything.
- That's what I was afraid of.

718
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:53,526
Howdy.

719
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:57,447
Against the law to drive with
one headlight. Let's see your license.

720
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,645
It's against the law
to drive without a license.

721
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:07,405
This here's my nephew.
I'm teaching him how to drive.

722
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,560
This is his grandpa, Mr. Wagoner.

723
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:12,323
I'm Red Stovall.
We're headed down to Nashville...

724
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:13,889
You got a license?

725
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:17,763
Well, Officer, I lost my wallet
about three days ago...

726
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:20,205
- and my license was in it.
- You own this car?

727
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:22,645
- I sure do.
- Let me see your registration.

728
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:24,888
There you go again.

729
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:28,008
When I lost that wallet,
I lost just about everything else in it.

730
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:30,843
It's against the law
to drive without a registration slip.

731
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:33,490
I'll get it fixed up
when we get to Nashville...

732
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:36,038
where I'm supposed to appear
on the Grand Ole Opry.

733
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,889
You a musician?

734
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:41,965
I play guitar and sing some.
Maybe you heard of me? Red Stovall?

735
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:45,486
I used to appear on the Louisiana Hayride
down out of Shreveport.

736
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:50,762
- Where's your guitar?
- Right here in back.

737
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:52,962
Got it right back here.

738
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:56,521
Beautiful brand new Gibson.

739
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:06,405
I put her there!
She wanted to go to Nashville with us...

740
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:08,446
and Uncle Red wouldn't let her.

741
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,964
- She's my sister.
- What are you doing in there, girl?

742
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:13,928
- I put her there. She's my sister.
- I didn't ask you, boy.

743
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:16,205
Well, it's just like he says, sir.

744
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:19,009
Uncle Red there,
he won't take me to Nashville<i>...</i>

745
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:22,408
Get out of there.
It's against the law to ride in a trunk.

746
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:26,359
I don't suppose you got any ID either?

747
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,566
Idee? Idee about what?

748
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:33,200
Look, Officer, these little devils
did play a trick on me.

749
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:35,406
But it's something we can settle
among ourselves.

750
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:37,242
I have to take you in.

751
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,885
Please, Officer! Please don't take us to jail!

752
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:42,768
- I'm begging you. I'll just do anything...
- Shut up!

753
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:44,562
Have to take in all out-of-state cars.

754
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:47,448
Out-of-state cars never come back
to pay their fines.

755
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:51,245
If it's the money you're worried about,
I could give you the money.

756
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,048
You trying to bribe me?

757
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:58,205
No. You could tell me how much
the judge charges in these matters...

758
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:02,044
and I give you the money, and you give it
to the judge. How's that sound?

759
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,245
$10.

760
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:15,084
If I was you, I'd get another headlight
before dark.

761
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:18,082
I'll get that done as
soon as we get down to Westville.

762
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:21,480
I'd rather you didn't do it
in Adair County, okay?

763
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:26,724
You let your uncle drive, boy.
You ain't old enough to be driving.

764
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,122
Well, I'm waiting.

765
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:53,810
Uncle Red, keep your eyes on the road.

766
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:59,449
- Can't you drive no better than that?
- I ain't had a lot of practice lately.

767
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:19,369
Let the boy drive.

768
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,087
Well? I'm still waiting.

769
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:28,522
She was hiding behind the seat
when we left Arnspringer's...

770
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:31,283
and we couldn't just send her
back to Arnspringer, could we?

771
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:34,999
I mean, after all,
she didn't go to the cops when we<i>...</i>

772
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:38,968
How old are you, girl?

773
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:41,200
- Eighteen.
- You're a liar.

774
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:45,322
- Seventeen, almost eighteen.
- You're still probably lying.

775
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:47,003
Probably 16.

776
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:50,319
What's a girl like you gonna do
in Nashville?

777
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:52,162
You got any money or friends?

778
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:54,639
What are you gonna do,
live on the streets?

779
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:56,527
The Lord will provide.

780
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:59,166
He better provide you a way
of getting there, too.

781
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:02,162
The next town we come to
with a bus stop, you're getting on it.

782
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:04,718
I'll give you enough money to get to Tulsa,
but that's it.

783
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,119
Mr. Stovall, please don't send me back!

784
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:08,928
I won't be any trouble. Honest, I won't.

785
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:10,568
- No.
- Please!

786
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:13,200
Please, I beg you!
Please don't send me back!

787
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:17,044
Stop that begging crap now,
or I'll kick your ass right out of this car!

788
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:25,929
Gasket's gone.

789
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:28,565
Won't go much further like this.
It's leaking oil.

790
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,641
How long would it take to fix it?

791
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:34,600
Two or three days.
I have to send to Little Rock for the parts.

792
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:38,644
Think it'll make it into Memphis
the way it is?

793
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:40,368
It might. It might not.

794
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:46,002
Let's chance it.

795
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:49,848
I don't think I wanna spend two days
in this town.

796
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:52,400
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

797
01:08:58,290 --> 01:09:00,963
- Are you gonna eat this?
- Put it down.

798
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,289
Mr. Stovall...

799
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:11,439
I wish there was something I could do
to make you like me a little.

800
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,242
If you only knew.

801
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:17,808
If only you'd let me<i>...</i>

802
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:19,969
Let you what?

803
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,204
Do something.

804
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:25,965
Sing.

805
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:28,728
Well, sing! That's it!

806
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:31,206
If you'd only let me sing...

807
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:34,123
maybe you'd want me
to go to Nashville with you.

808
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,089
Sing? Here?

809
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:40,442
Sure! I'd be glad to! I'd be more than glad!

810
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:43,167
All right. Sing, then.

811
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:46,362
You really want to hear me?

812
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:50,087
Well, would it be okay for me
to borrow your guitar?

813
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:53,567
Hoss, give her the guitar.

814
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,250
Thank you, Mr. Stovall.
You won't regret this.

815
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:00,440
Some folks said I'm gonna be
great someday.

816
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,407
That's what Madame Zora said.

817
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:05,250
- Madame who?
- She was a clairvoyant.

818
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:13,878
Just a minute.

819
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:17,007
Get right up on this log.
We gotta have a stage for you...

820
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:20,639
and give Miss Moonbeam here
every professional advantage.

821
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:23,160
- It's Moonglow.
- Whatever.

822
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:25,724
Well, the first song I'd like to sing...

823
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:28,284
is <i>My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean.</i>

824
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:31,007
Give me that damn guitar!

825
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:34,565
What's the matter? You didn't like it?

826
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:38,644
Maybe in an amateur contest
with a braying jackass...

827
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:40,322
you might stand a chance.

828
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:43,603
You'd better give up the idea
of ever being a singer.

829
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:47,324
I do <i>Red River Valley</i> a lot better.

830
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:03,046
Uncle Red, I don't think we can risk
going any further.

831
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:07,568
Good God. So this is where
it gives out on us!

832
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:09,124
Noxpater!

833
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:16,963
- How long to get it fixed?
- Two days.

834
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,684
I have to send to Little Rock
to get the parts.

835
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:22,728
Take one day to get them.
Fix it in another day.

836
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,245
Two days.

837
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:28,164
Is there a bus that goes through here
to Memphis?

838
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:30,320
Sholy. Ozark Stage.

839
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:33,563
Leaves from right here at 6:00 sharp.

840
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:37,206
- What the hell's "rat-chere"?
- Right here!

841
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:44,000
If you fellows don't mind,
I think I'll just go on by bus.

842
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:47,127
No sense in me sitting around here
for two days.

843
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:49,440
If I take the bus,
I could be in Murfreesboro...

844
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:51,202
before you get the car fixed.

845
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:54,726
I'd be much obliged to you, Red,
if I could have some of the money back...

846
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:57,278
seeing that we've come only
about halfway.

847
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:01,963
Look here, boy.

848
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:05,122
I don't see any sense in me
hanging around this town for two days.

849
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:08,839
I could get on that bus,
and I could head right on to Memphis.

850
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:11,524
I'd leave you money, of course,
so when this car is fixed...

851
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:14,363
you could meet me there.
How's that sound to you?

852
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:17,442
- I guess...
- I thought you'd be a sport about it.

853
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:19,482
But where'll I stay?

854
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:21,887
Is there a hotel in this town?

855
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:25,289
Hotel burned down four or five years ago.

856
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:28,159
You got a room for my nephew here?

857
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:29,524
Might be.

858
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:32,320
- Well, where?
- Right here.

859
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:34,368
One room upstairs.

860
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:37,089
Old woman will put some sheets
on the bed, if you want it.

861
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,319
$1 a day.

862
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:41,404
You see, boy? You're all set up.

863
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:44,120
What's the time that bus leaves?

864
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:47,680
Two a day. 6:00 p.m., 8:00 a.m.

865
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:51,445
More than two hours in this town.

866
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:54,598
Any place a man can get a drink
around here?

867
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:58,205
Roadhouse back up the road,
about half a mile.

868
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:01,001
What do you say, Mr. Wagoner?

869
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:03,558
Maybe you and I hike up
to that roadhouse and get a drink?

870
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:05,686
I can give you that money I owe you.

871
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:08,648
Don't care if I do. Stretch my legs a little.

872
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:11,079
What do you want me to do with her?

873
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,039
I don't give a damn.

874
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:17,439
Just don't have her with you
when you get to Memphis.

875
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:21,409
I'll give you plenty of money
so you can get her a ticket back to Tulsa.

876
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:35,203
- Where's Uncle Red?
- He met a waitress.

877
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:37,929
Said he'd be back here in time
to catch the bus.

878
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:40,205
He'd better hurry if he is.

879
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:43,203
Well, Whit...

880
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:45,440
you be a good boy now, you hear?

881
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:47,760
And you come see me in Cainsville.

882
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:50,319
Ask anybody about the Wagoner place.

883
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:53,204
I will, Grandpa. I'll come and see you.

884
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:57,322
Goodbye, my dear.

885
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:02,009
And, Whit...

886
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:03,923
stay with him.

887
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:05,648
Take care of him...

888
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:07,562
as best you can.

889
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:10,878
Let's go!

890
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:22,049
Bye, Grandpa.

891
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:25,409
See you in Tennessee!

892
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:37,169
Hold that bus!

893
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:48,719
Shit fire and save the matches.

894
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:52,360
Stuck in Noxpater, Arkansas.

895
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:54,526
When's the next bus out of here?

896
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:55,963
8:00 a.m. Tomorrow. Sharp.

897
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:22,888
Is that yahoo up there?

898
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:34,800
That bus leaves in five minutes.

899
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:38,128
Okay, I'll tell him.

900
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:40,729
Uncle Red, wake up.

901
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:43,888
Uncle Red, you're gonna
miss the bus. Wake up.

902
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:46,688
I have conceived.

903
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:49,929
What's that?

904
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:53,128
I have conceived.

905
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,288
What're you talking about?

906
01:16:58,370 --> 01:17:00,725
I am in the family way.

907
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:05,968
Guess what, Red?

908
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:08,848
Now I know how our destinies
were meant to be intertwined.

909
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:09,919
It's this.

910
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:12,041
I'm gonna bear your child.

911
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:15,606
I have conceived. I know I have, I can tell.
Isn't it wonderful, Red?

912
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:17,362
You're gonna be a father.

913
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:20,883
Hold that bus!

914
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,289
But, Red...

915
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:28,286
you're not going now, are you?
After what you said last night?

916
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:32,279
What'd I say? No, forget about it.
Hoss, go down there and hold that bus.

917
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:35,642
Red, ain't you heard anything I said?

918
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:38,802
I've heard enough.

919
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:41,882
You're crazy, you know that?
You are really crazy.

920
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:58,007
Here's enough money to get the car fixed
and get you on to Memphis.

921
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:01,560
I'll be at a place called the Top Hat Club
off Beale Street. You can find it.

922
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:03,129
But what about her?

923
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:05,520
- Her? I don't care.
- We're leaving.

924
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:07,682
All right, just a second.

925
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:11,203
Here's some money. Get her a bus ticket,
anyplace, anywhere.

926
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:14,487
Just don't have her with you
when you get to Memphis, you hear?

927
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:17,959
Did you hear anything last night?

928
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:21,005
I mean, did she and I do anything?

929
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:24,568
Okay, I'll see you in Memphis, Hoss.

930
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:27,323
Alone, you hear?

931
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:27,600
What's a white kid like you
doing way down here on Beale Street?

932
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:29,248
That's my Uncle Red.

933
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:36,519
It is? I'll tell you what.

934
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:39,765
Grab a chair right over here.

935
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:42,405
That way, in case the police come...

936
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,561
you can say you're our delivery boy.

937
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:46,684
Damn, Red Stovall,
when're you gonna get out in the sun...

938
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:48,408
and get some color in your face?

939
01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:52,085
Well, I could rub shoe polish on me
like I did down in Baton Rouge.

940
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:55,879
Hell, honey, no Klan gonna be bothering
you down here on Beale Street.

941
01:21:55,970 --> 01:21:58,689
You can just forget about
the shoe polish act this time.

942
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:01,842
I'll just rub up against you and
some of yours will rub off on me.

943
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:05,161
Honey, I'll rub it up against you,
but it sure won't rub off!

944
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:09,884
Now who in the world does
this little peckerwood belong to?

945
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:11,562
This is my nephew, Whit.

946
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:14,483
This is Flossie King,
the one I was telling you about.

947
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:16,369
I love you.

948
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:23,678
Red, who's been giving this boy dope?

949
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:28,759
- Here.
- Poor baby.

950
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:32,604
You just sit there
'cause I've got another act to do.

951
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:39,129
Ain't she great?
Best damn blues singer around.

952
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:42,448
Speaking of songbirds,
what'd you do with our singer?

953
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:45,643
I left her at the bus station, like you said.

954
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:47,129
Where was she heading?

955
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:49,519
She mentioned something
about Nashville.

956
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:53,046
If she tries to make trouble for me, Hoss,
you'll have to be my witness.

957
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:56,286
Trouble? How could
she make trouble for you?

958
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:58,964
You heard all that talk
about being in the family way.

959
01:22:59,050 --> 01:23:01,439
She setting me up for a paternity suit.

960
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:03,646
You think she'd do something like that?

961
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:25,768
Don't you think you have a problem
with your drinking?

962
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:28,767
Only when I can't get it.

963
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:32,843
I mean, don't you think you might need
some help with your drinking?

964
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:36,080
No, I do quite well all by myself.

965
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:40,800
- Aren't there doctors...
- Look, Hoss...

966
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:44,162
if you wanna be my sidekick
and chauffeur, that's fine.

967
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:46,605
But if I want a nursemaid
and a wife to bitch at me...

968
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:49,079
I'll go out and get myself one. Understand?

969
01:23:57,530 --> 01:24:00,249
Was there ever anyone
that you wanted to marry?

970
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,085
Marry?

971
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:09,724
Yeah, I guess there was, a few years back.

972
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:11,403
Who was she?

973
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:17,846
A girl I knew out in California.
Mary Simms was her name.

974
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:26,005
Why didn't you? Marry her, I mean.

975
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:30,122
She was married already.

976
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:33,205
A farmer married her
when she was 14 years old.

977
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:34,609
She had two kids.

978
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,480
Wasn't much to look at, really.

979
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:41,359
Just a raw-boned Okie girl.

980
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:46,322
But she was a fine, decent,
and faithful woman.

981
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:50,001
At least until I met her.

982
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:52,563
What happened?

983
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:56,802
She ran off with me.

984
01:24:57,690 --> 01:25:00,409
I told her I loved her just to get to her.

985
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:05,205
I knew it was a lie.
I thought she figured it was a lie, too.

986
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:08,726
But she took me serious.
She told me she loved me, too.

987
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:11,728
And she meant it.

988
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:14,888
We bummed around the country...

989
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:17,689
broke most of the time.

990
01:25:17,970 --> 01:25:20,438
We even worked
the fruit harvest for awhile.

991
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:23,766
Lived in some...

992
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:26,484
flophouses and migrant labor shacks.

993
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:28,483
It was all right.

994
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:30,641
It was more than all right.

995
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:35,925
I was happier than I think I've ever been
before in my life.

996
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:37,363
Before or since.

997
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:42,963
What happened?

998
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:46,762
I got tired of it, I guess.

999
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:51,923
I started wondering what I was doing
with this raw-boned Okie girl...

1000
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:57,126
thinking about all the women
that were hanging around the bars...

1001
01:25:57,210 --> 01:25:58,689
that I worked in.

1002
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:01,681
I told her I felt we'd made a mistake.

1003
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:05,369
I told her to get her own place.
I gave her all my money...

1004
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:06,929
so she could get one.

1005
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:09,841
She threw the money in my face.

1006
01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:13,563
She said that she didn't want
any part of me or my money.

1007
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:16,200
She took off
and went back to her husband.

1008
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:21,001
And you? What'd you do?

1009
01:26:22,890 --> 01:26:26,121
I got drunk and started
feeling sorry for myself as usual.

1010
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:32,721
I got to thinking
what a no-good bastard I was...

1011
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:35,201
and what a decent girl Mary was.

1012
01:26:36,490 --> 01:26:39,368
I got to thinking
maybe I loved her all along.

1013
01:26:40,410 --> 01:26:43,720
Maybe I loved her all this time
and just never realized it until...

1014
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:45,443
I'd lost her.

1015
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:51,246
You didn't try to find her?

1016
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:56,559
I heard she was pregnant
before she left me.

1017
01:26:57,170 --> 01:27:01,049
I went on down to Brawley
where she was from and tried to see her.

1018
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:04,960
But before I could see her,
I ran into her husband and his brother.

1019
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,609
They beat me up pretty bad
in the parking lot.

1020
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:11,929
Her husband said
Mary didn't want to see me no more.

1021
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:14,399
If I ever tried to see her again...

1022
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:18,206
they'd break my fingers
and I'd never play the guitar again.

1023
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:20,403
So I left town.

1024
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:24,246
And did she have the baby?

1025
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:26,528
Yeah, I heard she did.

1026
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:28,409
A little girl.

1027
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:32,763
You never tried to see her? The little girl?

1028
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:40,449
No, she's better off
not knowing about me.

1029
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:44,043
Mary was right to go back to her husband.

1030
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:46,878
What the hell did I have to offer a kid?

1031
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,926
Just honkytonks and flophouses.

1032
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:53,241
That's the life of a country singer.

1033
01:27:53,330 --> 01:27:55,639
Hoss, does it sound good to you?

1034
01:27:57,610 --> 01:28:00,408
Don't sound too hot
when you put it like that.

1035
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:04,563
But it sure beats picking cotton
and living in a sharecropper's shack.

1036
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:10,927
Maybe you're right, boy.

1037
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:13,202
Maybe you're right.

1038
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:16,564
Maybe if I get this break on the Opry...

1039
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:22,000
we won't have to stay in any flophouses
or sharecropper's shacks ever again.

1040
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:13,128
Thank you, Dusty.

1041
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:15,162
We'll be in touch.

1042
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:21,769
Well, Mr. Stovall<i>...</i>

1043
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:25,550
Red, anytime you're ready.

1044
01:30:25,570 --> 01:30:28,403
That won't stand in the way
of a deal I have to offer you.

1045
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:31,687
Do you think we can sit down
and talk about it for a minute?

1046
01:30:36,050 --> 01:30:38,518
My partner, Charlie Jones...

1047
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:40,362
he was at the Opry today, too.

1048
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:43,601
He and I are down here from New York
looking for new talent.

1049
01:30:46,370 --> 01:30:47,598
You interest us.

1050
01:30:47,690 --> 01:30:51,000
After I heard you today,
I got on the phone to the company...

1051
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:54,128
and the upshot was I've been
authorized to offer you a deal...

1052
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:56,041
to record for Burnside.

1053
01:30:57,130 --> 01:30:59,849
We'll pay you $20
for each song you record.

1054
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:02,326
For ones we like, that is.

1055
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:06,202
A flat fee? No royalties?

1056
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:09,327
I'm afraid not. The people
in the front office insist on that.

1057
01:31:10,650 --> 01:31:13,005
This'll be a chance for you
to find a mass audience...

1058
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:14,489
and that's what you want, isn't it?

1059
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:18,483
You get one hit record out of this,
you'll be able to write your own ticket.

1060
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:21,361
When do you want to do all this?

1061
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:23,283
Tomorrow...

1062
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:26,322
if you feel up to it.

1063
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:34,881
I want $100 in advance.

1064
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:37,608
I think we can manage that.

1065
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:39,726
A drummer, steel guitar,
and a decent piano man.

1066
01:31:39,810 --> 01:31:41,368
You'll have them.

1067
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:43,688
Here's where you can find us.

1068
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:48,162
10:00, okay?

1069
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:53,089
See you then.

1070
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:59,928
But, Uncle Red, the doctor said<i>...</i>
He said you shouldn't sing at all.

1071
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:03,449
Hell, they've been saying that for years.

1072
01:32:04,210 --> 01:32:06,849
Maybe they've been right for years, too.

1073
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:10,128
Don't worry about it, Hoss.

1074
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:12,519
It's a pretty good deal. $20 a record.

1075
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:14,840
In a couple of days, we'll have enough to...

1076
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:17,683
get the car fixed
and get on back to California.

1077
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:20,522
Here, I bought this for you.

1078
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:23,568
It's probably cold by now,
but you should try and eat it.

1079
01:32:23,650 --> 01:32:24,924
Another hamburger?

1080
01:32:25,370 --> 01:32:27,042
Is that all you eat, hamburgers?

1081
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:29,208
You're gonna turn into one.

1082
01:32:47,690 --> 01:32:50,409
One take from here.
It'll keep you away from the steel.

1083
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:52,048
You boys about ready?

1084
01:32:58,930 --> 01:33:01,808
We might need a barrel of ice
to keep those masters in...

1085
01:33:01,890 --> 01:33:03,767
to protect them from this heat.

1086
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:05,806
Good idea. All right, Red.

1087
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:10,080
We're gonna go for a rehearsal.
Why don't you take it from the bridge?

1088
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,606
Red, why don't we take a break,
give your voice a little rest?

1089
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:58,406
A doctor. I'll go get the doctor.

1090
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:01,209
No, I'm all right.

1091
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:05,288
Run to the liquor store downstairs
and get me a bottle.

1092
01:35:05,410 --> 01:35:07,048
Tell the guy it's for me.

1093
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:08,848
But it's getting worse, Uncle Red.

1094
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:11,046
Maybe a sanitarium, just for a little while?

1095
01:35:11,130 --> 01:35:14,759
I've been in the sanatorium once, Hoss.
I ain't never going back again.

1096
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:17,484
- Well, it's your life.
- That's right, it is.

1097
01:35:18,530 --> 01:35:21,681
I intend to live it out on my own terms
or I ain't gonna live at all.

1098
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:24,688
That don't include...

1099
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:27,443
having an oxygen tube
stuffed in your nose...

1100
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:29,168
and feeding tubes in your arm.

1101
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:31,684
Is that the way
you wanna see me go out, Hoss?

1102
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:34,238
All I want to see you do is get well.

1103
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:07,922
That's three in a row, Red.

1104
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:11,161
Why don't we take a break
and give your voice a little rest?

1105
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:35,485
He's a lot worse today, isn't he?

1106
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:37,762
Did he have a bad night?

1107
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:39,522
He had a hemorrhage.

1108
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:43,127
- He is seeing a doctor, isn't he?
- Just the Opry doctor.

1109
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:47,928
He said Uncle Red might die if he don't
stop singing and go to a sanitarium.

1110
01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:51,039
You don't think
he should be doing this, do you?

1111
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:53,844
Do you? Knowing it might kill him?

1112
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:57,960
Want me to level with you, pal?

1113
01:36:58,650 --> 01:37:01,210
He's going to die anyway, and he knows it.

1114
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:04,198
And he knows that this is his last chance.

1115
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:07,282
Last chance? For what?

1116
01:37:07,730 --> 01:37:09,209
To be somebody.

1117
01:37:10,770 --> 01:37:13,284
Did you ever feel
like you wanted to be somebody?

1118
01:37:17,490 --> 01:37:19,606
If he makes these recordings...

1119
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:21,604
who knows?

1120
01:40:01,090 --> 01:40:03,888
Okay, that's great.
Thanks for helping out, Smoky.

1121
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:09,088
I'm really sorry, Red.
You gonna be all right?

1122
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:15,487
Let's go for one more.

1123
01:40:16,130 --> 01:40:18,803
Let him go.
Can't you see he's had enough?

1124
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:28,644
All right. Let's listen to the playback
of this one and call it a day.

1125
01:40:28,730 --> 01:40:30,800
You go home
and get a good night's rest, Red.

1126
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:33,450
We'll do a few more tomorrow.
You're doing great, pal.

1127
01:40:45,010 --> 01:40:46,079
Hoss!

1128
01:40:48,330 --> 01:40:49,809
Hoss, it's me!

1129
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:52,121
Marlene! What're you...

1130
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:54,644
Lord, I've been looking all over for you.

1131
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:57,290
I've finally found a friend in Nashville!

1132
01:40:57,370 --> 01:41:00,680
Hoss, this city is something.
All these dirty old men<i>...</i>

1133
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:02,802
How'd you find us?

1134
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:05,408
Asked the people at the Opry.

1135
01:41:05,490 --> 01:41:08,288
Told them Red was my uncle
and I had to find him.

1136
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:11,806
What's the matter? You look green
around the gills. You sick?

1137
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:14,440
It's Uncle Red. TB.

1138
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:17,845
TB?

1139
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:20,198
Is it bad?

1140
01:41:20,330 --> 01:41:22,366
I don't know. I think he's dying.

1141
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:31,324
Hoss, I got to see him and tell him
I'm sorry about all that back there.

1142
01:41:32,010 --> 01:41:34,285
I'm not in the family way after all.

1143
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:47,803
I never did believe that story
about you being knocked up anyway.

1144
01:41:58,130 --> 01:42:00,564
Why don't you two get out of here...

1145
01:42:00,690 --> 01:42:02,920
and go see a movie or something?

1146
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:12,528
I'm sorry if she<i>...</i>

1147
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:15,479
I told her you probably didn't<i>...</i>

1148
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:17,369
It's all right, boy.

1149
01:42:17,450 --> 01:42:18,883
She's all right.

1150
01:42:19,730 --> 01:42:21,402
Got a lot of brass.

1151
01:42:23,210 --> 01:42:25,519
You work with her on her singing,
though, will you?

1152
01:42:35,210 --> 01:42:36,563
Here. Call this doctor.

1153
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:39,483
There's a telephone in the drugstore
down the block.

1154
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:01,566
I left him some laudanum.

1155
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:04,599
See that he takes it
and gets plenty of rest.

1156
01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:08,679
If his breathing becomes difficult...

1157
01:43:09,210 --> 01:43:12,919
you can go down to Baxby's Pharmacy
and get him an oxygen tank.

1158
01:43:14,690 --> 01:43:16,601
That's all we can do now.

1159
01:43:18,570 --> 01:43:21,607
Can't we take him to a sanitarium,
like you said?

1160
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:23,488
It's too late for that.

1161
01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:28,768
Actually, it's been too late for a long time.

1162
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:33,489
All you can do now
is make him comfortable.

1163
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:36,768
How long has he got?

1164
01:43:42,050 --> 01:43:43,244
Not long.

1165
01:43:45,170 --> 01:43:46,762
Maybe a few hours.

1166
01:43:47,490 --> 01:43:49,287
Maybe even a few days.

1167
01:44:10,890 --> 01:44:12,801
He looks a little better.

1168
01:44:12,930 --> 01:44:15,763
I think maybe
he's gonna be okay this time.

1169
01:44:25,770 --> 01:44:26,839
What?

1170
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:33,359
Hoss, you got your hands full this time,
don't you?

1171
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:38,167
I got some oxygen here.

1172
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:43,766
That's what they give you
in the sanitarium.

1173
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:48,120
Is there anything I can get you?

1174
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:55,842
You go get some rest.

1175
01:45:17,330 --> 01:45:18,319
Mary.

1176
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:29,084
My raw-boned Okie girl.

1177
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:34,519
I love you.

1178
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:52,324
Uncle Red.

1179
01:46:43,050 --> 01:46:44,847
I'll be leaving now.

1180
01:46:45,690 --> 01:46:48,204
Now listen, son,
if you ever get the money...

1181
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:51,289
and you do want him
to have a nice headstone...

1182
01:46:51,370 --> 01:46:53,759
you just let me know,
and I'll see to it personally...

1183
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:56,318
that a real nice one is placed on the grave.

1184
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:48,408
What's the matter?

1185
01:48:48,490 --> 01:48:51,209
I don't know. I've been
feeling sick the past few mornings.

1186
01:48:51,490 --> 01:48:52,889
Probably just nerves.

1187
01:49:03,650 --> 01:49:05,686
So what're you gonna do now, Hoss?

1188
01:49:05,770 --> 01:49:08,159
Guess I'll make my way out to California.

1189
01:49:08,290 --> 01:49:09,643
California?

1190
01:49:09,970 --> 01:49:11,881
Well, that's my heart's dream.

1191
01:49:12,050 --> 01:49:14,439
Hoss, I'll just do anything
to go to California.

1192
01:49:14,570 --> 01:49:16,481
You wouldn't mind if I was to go with you?

1193
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:18,163
I've been thinking it would be nice
if in memory of Red...

1194
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:21,840
we could put some kind
of a little act together.

1195
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:23,602
Sing some of his songs.

1196
01:49:23,690 --> 01:49:26,602
It would be real nice and I could make
some costumes and all.

1197
01:49:26,690 --> 01:49:29,488
We could play in some honkytonks,
maybe make some money...

1198
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:31,562
just to get ourselves to California.

1199
01:49:31,650 --> 01:49:33,481
It'd be a good thing to do.

1200
01:49:33,570 --> 01:49:35,640
