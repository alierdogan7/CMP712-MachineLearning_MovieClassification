1
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:35,641
[Cowhand Shouting] Yah! Giddap!
[Cow Mooing]

2
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:41,314
Yah! Yah!

3
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:43,716
Glyn, have a biscuit.

4
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:50,354
Giddap there!

5
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:53,623
Hah! Giddap! Yah!

6
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,128
Whoa! Whoa!

7
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:03,569
Whoa! Whoa!

8
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:08,205
This is good.
Bring 'em up for a nightcap.

9
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:10,508
Hello, funny face. Hey.

10
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,378
Eat a good biscuit.
Mrs. Prentiss made it.

11
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:15,713
I make better.
[Chuckling]

12
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:19,346
I don't know how much better,
but I will say they're harder.

13
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:22,880
We got three hours left in
the day. Why don't we keep on?

14
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,894
We got water here.
May pay out by night.

15
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:29,557
Marjie promised to scrub out
a shirt for me. I did not!

16
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:32,726
I didn't promise.
I said maybe.

17
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:36,294
Bring it to the wagon. I'll
scrub it out, but I won't like it.

18
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:38,465
All right.
Why not?

19
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:42,477
Your mother used to scrub ten
shirts. Twenty! And pants too.

20
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:44,775
He hasn't got ten.
Have you?

21
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:48,045
No. One on, one off,
one in the wash.

22
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:51,211
Make your circle right near
to the stream there.

23
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:54,222
Think I'll ride out
for a couple of hours.

24
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,056
Might be an easy trail
past the hills.

25
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:02,360
Yah! Hah!

26
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,917
Yah! Hah! Hah!
[Cows Mooing]

27
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:45,799
You stole a horse. Anything
to say? Cut him loose!

28
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:49,704
Drop your guns.

29
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:52,577
All right, untie him.

30
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,054
Come on over there!
Move!

31
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:19,266
[Neighing]

32
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:50,538
[Sighing]
Ah!

33
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:55,043
About this horse, I really didn't
steal him, if that makes any difference.

34
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:57,011
It doesn't.

35
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,312
That's what I thought.
Why did you step in?

36
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,046
Well, I just
don't like hangin's.

37
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,884
That's a funny thing. I
don't either. [Chuckling]

38
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:09,823
You ridin' south?
No, I'm goin' north.

39
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,884
Takin' some folks up in
the Columbia River country.

40
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,726
Farmers. Real nice folks.
Yeah, settlers, huh?

41
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:18,858
Is that your trade,
a guide?

42
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:21,165
No, not exactly.

43
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,001
I've been doin'
a lot of things.

44
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:28,442
I ran into these folks in Missouri. Thought
I might try my hand at farmin' or ranchin'...

45
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:31,674
if I can find me
some cattle.

46
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,979
They make good biscuits, these
folks. You're gonna like 'em.

47
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:38,646
I didn't catch your name,
or did you say it?

48
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:41,781
McLyntock.
Glyn McLyntock.

49
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:44,258
Glyn McLyntock?

50
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:46,557
From the Missouri country?

51
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:49,291
That's right.
You're gonna go farmin'?

52
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:52,801
Or ranchin', if I can
get me some cattle.

53
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,871
Come on, let's get
those biscuits.

54
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,028
I thought we're out of Cheyenne
country. What do ya make of that?

55
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:24,328
Shoshone. Real mean
when they wanna be.

56
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,836
Lately, they wanna be. They cut up some
trappers last week for their rifles.

57
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:30,338
Your people got any rifles? Mm-hmm.

58
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:32,840
They know how to use 'em? No.

59
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:36,345
How'd you get out of the Black Hills
country and the Big Horn? Lucky.

60
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:38,846
Glyn, you're late!

61
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:43,011
You better get some supper before
Marjie eats it all. [Chuckling]

62
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:47,579
Got beans, tea
and biscuits.

63
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,354
Soft ones this time. Those
biscuits I was telling you about.

64
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:54,362
I see you found
yourself a friend.

65
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,456
I found him hangin'
around. [Chuckling] Yeah.

66
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:00,559
I guess I missed your name,
or did you say it?

67
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:02,627
Cole.
Emerson Cole.

68
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:07,699
You'reJeremy Baile.
Glyn told me about you.

69
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:12,146
Are you, eh... you
Emerson Cole of Kansas way?

70
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:17,814
Yeah.

71
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:21,482
Yeah, you're gonna
like these biscuits.

72
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:24,924
Oh, Laura? Laura,
this is Emerson Cole here.

73
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:28,430
He's hungry. Give him
something to eat, will ya?

74
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,002
Say, I was thinking
about tomorrow.

75
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,336
We can save a lot of miles
if we go straight north.

76
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:42,844
Now, this place we're headed
for, 150 miles east from Portland.

77
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:45,847
That's right. That's just over
that tall mountain, isn't it?

78
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:51,012
That's right, just over. Well,
you say we should go here.

79
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:54,022
Uh-huh. I think we should go so.

80
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,025
You could go so,
but that mountain there...

81
00:07:57,093 --> 00:08:00,028
that tall fella with
the white hair, he...

82
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,530
he's about
two miles high.

83
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,734
Got a lot of hills around him
one mile high...

84
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:10,238
so you climb and climb...
Just one mile? Is that too bad?

85
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:13,241
It isn't very good
when it's straight up.

86
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:16,073
You got the food
to think about.

87
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:19,842
By the time you get your grounds
cleared and houses built, it'd be winter.

88
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,875
If you haven't arranged to have the supplies
sent from Portland, what are you gonna eat?

89
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:27,548
It was just an idea. A lot
of people had the same idea.

90
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:31,559
Most of them are still up there
under the snow. [Bird Singing]

91
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:42,670
Glyn, where you been? Up in the hills.

92
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:45,172
There you are.

93
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:54,011
You've been eating this food all
the way from Missouri? Mm-hmm.

94
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:58,179
Wearin' the same shirt too. I said I'd
scrub it, but I can't with you in it.

95
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:02,020
Well, I'm not in this
one. [Bird Singing]

96
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:05,857
Night birds. I haven't
heard them before.

97
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:10,228
They're sort of a special kind.
They live up in the hills.

98
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,700
Redwing orioles. Yeah,
redwing orioles from Canada.

99
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:16,602
Yeah, from Canada.
From, uh... [Bird Cawing]

100
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:20,804
[Bird Singing]
They're sort of plaintive.

101
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:24,312
I hope they nest
near our farm.

102
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,575
Don't you like them?

103
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,944
No, no,
not for neighbors.

104
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:35,455
Laura, Mrs. Prentiss got a lot of
boiling water. What about the shirt?

105
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:39,119
You're a nuisance. And I'm sorry for
your wife, whoever she's going to be.

106
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:42,096
What, because
I like a clean shirt?

107
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,099
Get up from there.
I wanna do my chores.

108
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,601
Always point this
toward the North Star.

109
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,764
Where is it?
There we are.

110
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,775
Then come morning,
we know where we're going.

111
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,141
Is that the way you travel? Always.

112
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:59,010
But I never pick
the same star.

113
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:02,414
Tomorrow, it might be
that big fat one there.

114
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:05,750
The next day, I might take a
fancy to that skinny one there.

115
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:07,721
[Laura Chuckling]

116
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,224
I'll tell her.
She's my sister.

117
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:15,529
Nice girl, that.
Yeah, real nice.

118
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:18,192
Your girl?

119
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:20,531
No.

120

121
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:28,710
[Cawing]

122
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,973
Yeah, redwing
orioles.

123
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,778
Mm-hmm, from Canada, huh? [Cawing]

124
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,342
How many do you figure?
Oh, about six or ten.

125
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:41,913
If they were a big war party,
they'd have come barging in before this.

126
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,926
You ever tangle with
any? Yeah, a time or two.

127
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:47,189
That was with Martinson
up on the Snake.

128
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:49,595

00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:52,190

133
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:03,311
[Gunshots] [Man] Take cover!

134
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:09,808
All right, Glyn,
I'll take care of her.

135
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:12,319
[Gunshots]

136
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:18,016
Come on, get under the
wagons! Get under the wagons!

137
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,029
Stop shootin' at
moonbeams! Hold your fire!

138
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:25,659
Hold your fire 'til you can see what you're
shootin' at. [Chuckling] Which they won't.

139
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:32,530
They're using that for cover,
beyond the stream. It seems like it.

140
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,544
Keep an eye on 'em, will ya?
Don't let 'em waste any more lead.

141
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,046
Are you gonna
go after 'em?

142
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,551
That's better than them
coming in after us.

143
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,515
[Groans] No need for
you to go out there.

144
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,923
I know it.

145
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:01,960
[/ndian Cawing]

146
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:24,392
I'll move in. You
try and call one up.

00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:48,875

150
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:33,847
[Whispering] Five of'em. Less one.

151
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:40,223
[Whinnying]

152
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:49,731
[Horse Neighing]

153
00:14:56,011 --> 00:15:00,038
[Cawing] Stay here.
I'll send you an oriole.

154
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:09,981

[Gunshots]

160
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,012
[Panting]
And one makes five.

161
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,055
You'll do exactly as I say,
Jeremy. You'll drive slowly.

162
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,724
And two hours rest
at noon.

163
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,701
What about the Shoshones?
They might come back.

164
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,034
I doubt it. Indians or
not, I want a smooth road.

165
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,233
No bumps,
you understand?

166
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:08,902
How's Laura this
morning? Fair to middlin'.

167
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:11,912
And I hope
to keep her that way.

168
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:18,511
Morning!
Good morning.

I'm sorry.

That's real nice of you.

and everything, I thought it...

I used to put out the fire.

174

I'm afraid it's
a little scorched.

Yes, slightly. You can put out
fires with sand too, you know.

Well, Laura, five, six days,
we'll be in Portland.

until you're free.

330
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:12,872
Uh, well, perhaps our friend
would like to have my dance.

331
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:14,938
Marjie, may I
present Mr...

332
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:18,952
- Trey Wilson of San Francisco.
- Trey Wilson of San Francisco.

333
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,488
Pleased to make your
acquaintance, ma'am.

334
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,719
I'm Marjie Baile.
Shall we dance?

335
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:26,784
Uh, later,
if you please.

336
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:31,298
I have some business with these
gentlemen. Well, I hope you lose!

337
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:36,565
Now, about those few hands
of poker. If you wish.

338
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:44,378
Marjie, I didn't mean
to be rude over there.

339
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:47,506
This is my dance
though, you know.

340
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,846
Yes, it is.

341
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,251
Well, come on,
let's, let's, let's go then.

342
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:05,296
Right handsome fella
there, isn't he?

343
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:08,734
I've seen handsomer.
Like me, for instance.

344
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:12,170
Oh, you're very handsome,
in an elderly sort of way.

345
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,333
In an elderly...
Yeah.

346
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:17,503
Could I cut in, sir,
please? How's that? Oh!

347
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:20,673
Well, if...
if you insist...

348
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:23,183

349
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:31,516

350
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:34,084
[Hendricks] Join me
in a drink. Thank you.

351
00:28:34,162 --> 00:28:36,858

352
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:39,525
[Snaps Finger]
Now I remember.

353
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:44,470
There was a killin' in Kansas
at the Trail's End Saloon.

354
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:49,533
You were one of
the Missouri border raiders.

355
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:51,943
I'll take mine
from the top.

356
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:54,573
You got it
from the top.

357
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:59,086
That last one came from the
bottom. It's the deuce of spades.

358
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:03,319
You're a liar!

359
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:14,001
You're real fast with that
gun, kid, but you're soft.

360
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:16,161
Someday it'll kill ya.

361
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:19,832
You sure the kid was right about
that card? Yeah. I knew Grundy.

362
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:22,342
Is that why
you killed him?

363
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,504
Or was it because
he knew you?

364
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:43,263
[Indistinct Chatter]

365
00:29:46,134 --> 00:29:49,763
[Thudding] Be careful with those
apple trees. They mustn't get hurt.

366
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:52,204
Is them apple trees?
Yes!

367
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:55,674
These are plums.
These are pears. All different.

368
00:29:55,743 --> 00:29:58,644
We'll have the finest fruit
in all the world upriver.

369
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:02,706
Them ain't apple trees. I seen
an apple tree when I was a kid.

370
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:05,548
It was as big as a house.
[Ship Whistle Blows]

371
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,350
All aboard that's comin'aboard!
Hurry up!

372
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:10,550
[Captain] We're
gettin'under way. Good-bye.

373
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,786
Good-bye, Marjie.
Good-bye.

374
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:16,024
Good-bye. Decided to
stay in Portland, huh?

375
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:19,294
For a while. Then I thought
I'd drift on down to California.

376
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:21,460
Still followin' that star?

377
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:24,562
Sometimes it's better than having
a man with a star following you.

378
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:26,937
I'll see ya.
Everybody aboard!

379
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:31,843
Haul in the gangplank. Let's
go! Hurry it up! [Whistle Blows]

380
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:36,441
Don't forget, you're coming
up to see me. If I have time.

381
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:40,215
Well, it looks like we might
have a romance in the making.

382
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:42,552
Trey's a good boy.

383
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:45,752
I don't like that man Cole. Why not?

384
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:48,762
I heard Grundy say he was a
raider on the Missouri border.

385
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,823
Lots of people used to raid.
Some of them decided to change.

386
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,335
That kind can't change.

387
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:58,839
When an apple's rotten, there's nothing
you can do except throw it away...

388
00:30:58,907 --> 00:31:02,308
or it'll spoil the whole
barrel. [Apple Thudding]

389
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:04,902
There's a difference
between apples and men.

390
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:07,777
[Whistle Blowing]
Stand by to cast off!

391
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:09,714
Clear your bow lines!

[Indistinct Shouting]

393
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:17,090
Ease off on
the stern lines!

394
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:20,059
Easy there!
Clear the bow!

395
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,426
Cast off all lines!

396
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:25,227
[Whistle Blows]

397
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,066
Mind if we come up? Not at
all, if you keep out of the way.

398
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:33,699
I got enough people up here giving
orders to my crew now! Half astern!

399
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:36,835
[Blowing]
Half astern!

400
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,918
Bye!

401
00:31:48,423 --> 00:31:50,357
Full astern!

402
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:54,191
[Blowing]
Full astern!

[Indistinct Shouting]

404
00:32:40,808 --> 00:32:43,072
Beautiful, aren't they?

405
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:47,740
Those are the ones you wanted to drive
over in the wagon. We'd have made it.

406
00:32:47,815 --> 00:32:50,909
Oh, sure. Of course, this way is easier.

407
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:54,580
How far upriver can we
go? Another 40, 50 miles.

408
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:57,090
Then we come
to the rapids?

409
00:32:57,158 --> 00:33:01,322
No way of getting the boat past,
unless you take it apart and carry it.

410
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,924
- You sure you don't want me to do that too?
- Never you mind!

411
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,369
Someday we'll have a portage past the
rapids, and boats on the upper river.

412
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:13,373
Keep her in closer to the bank! Why?

413
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:17,969
It's better goin'. I came this way in a
canoe, and we stayed close to the bank.

414
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:20,139
This ain't no canoe!

[Whistle Blowing]

This is as far as you can go.

[Jeremy Chuckling]
Yeah, / see what you mean.

418
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,115
But the wagons will take us
around the rapids.

419
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,916
In a day or two, you'll see
some of the finest country...

420
00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:07,859
God ever put on
the face of this planet.

421
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:13,465
It's what I've always
dreamed about, Glyn...

422
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:16,970
a new country where
we can make things grow.

423
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:20,530
[Jeremy] We'll find a valley
where the earth is rich...

424
00:34:20,608 --> 00:34:23,873
where the mountains shelter us
from the north winds.

425
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:27,210
We'll use the trees
that nature has given us...

426
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:29,875
cut a clearing
in the wilderness.

427
00:34:29,951 --> 00:34:32,044
We'll put in roads...

428
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,556
and use the timber to bridge
the streams where we have to.

429
00:34:35,623 --> 00:34:38,387
Hah! Then we'll build our homes, Glyn,;

430
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:42,225
build them strong to stand
against the winter snows.

431
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:44,730
There'll be
a meeting house...

432
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:47,063
a church.

433
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:49,569
We'll have a school.

434
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:52,128
Then we'll put down seedlings.

435
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:54,902
There'll be apples, pears.

436
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:57,911
/n a few years, we'll bring
fruit to the world...

437
00:34:57,979 --> 00:35:01,415
such as the eyes of man
has never seen.

438
00:35:06,154 --> 00:35:08,179
All of this is good...

439
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:12,852
but it'll all be for nothing unless we get
enough food to carry us through the winter.

440
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:16,363
I've been watching the snow clouds
forming over those mountains.

441
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,263
In a few weeks,
we'll be iced in.

442
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:22,166
It's bad, Glyn, bad.

443
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,999
I'm worried. Any word from Portland?

444
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:30,100
None at all. Those supplies were
supposed to be here in September.

445
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:33,477
And here it is,
the middle of October.

446
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,951
Come to the end of the flour.
Another week, no more bacon and beans.

447
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:40,453
No more nothin'
in two weeks.

448
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:43,490
I hadn't realized it was that
bad. No use worryin' you men.

You have your work to do. Captain Mello
may be havin' trouble with that steamboat.

450

Hendricks should've
let us know.

451
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:53,533
We should ride to Portland
and find out what's the matter.

452

I'm worried about Laura.
No word. Nothin'.

or I'll feed it to the hogs!

I wish I had
a couple of hogs.

457
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,366
Someday we gotta find a way
to get across that mountain.

458
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,870
We could save a week or ten
days on a trip to Portland.

459
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,701
Well, if we can't find a way...

460
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:36,709
somebody'll have to come and find
us under about ten feet of snow.

Let's hope we can
keep it this way.

when I first saw 'em. Good, clean.

It was the men who came to steal
and kill that changed things.

was worth when you bought it last spring.

493
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,565
See this? That's how
it's climbed ever since.

494
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:49,075
But it's our flour. We paid
for it. It was your flour.

495
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:58,014
You fellas want to make
a dollar apiece?

496
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,949
Uh, five dollars?

497
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:05,584
I'll give you ten dollars
apiece for one hour's work.

498
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:08,856
And a bottle of whiskey? And a
bottle of whiskey. It's a deal.

499
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:12,023
Get 'em to get this stuff
aboard. The horses and cattle too.

500
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:17,036
Is that all right with you? If that's
the way it's gonna be, deal me in.

501
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:21,006
Glyn, find out about Laura! All
right, men, get this... All right.

502
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:24,738
You're a little naked to go callin'
on Hendricks. You ain't wearin' a gun.

503
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:27,747
Can I get you one?
No, thanks.

507
00:40:09,623 --> 00:40:13,320
What's the chance of a fella buyin' a
thousand dollars' worth of blue chips?

508
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:17,660
Good to see ya! What brought you into
town? [Together] A real tired horse.

509
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:20,097
[Laughing]
Hey, Trey!

510
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,068
Yeah? LetJohn take your hand.

511
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:27,306
That star of yours
brought you a real pot of gold.

512
00:40:27,374 --> 00:40:30,434
It would have if I got here
first, but I got here late...

513
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:34,106
so I'm working as Hendricks' pit
boss. It's quite a layout. Hello, Trey.

514
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,116
Good to see you, sir. Heard
about the gold strike? I've heard.

515
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,119
How're the folks? How's
Jeremy? Fine. Jeremy's fine.

516
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:43,122
And his daughter, uh...
what was her name?

517
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:47,126
You know very well what
her name is. Name's Marjie.

518
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,288
And she's more beautiful than ever,
and she's probably gonna marry...

519
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:54,801
one of those 20 young fellas that
proposed to her. That's fine. That's fine.

520
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,804
She's a nice girl.
If I were the marrying kind...

521
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:02,070
Never mix marriage with gambling.
The percentage is against it.

522
00:41:02,143 --> 00:41:05,544
Let's have a drink. Whiskey,
two. Glad to see you, Trey.

523
00:41:07,648 --> 00:41:10,742
How's Laura? The shoulder, is
it all healed up? It's fine.

524
00:41:10,818 --> 00:41:13,184
She runs the gold scales
for Hendricks.

525
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:16,690
Fifty-nine ounces,
give or take a grain.

526
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:20,284
Just about the only person
in town you can trust.

527
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:23,588
Well.

528
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:28,764
$1,240. How will you
have it, credit or coin?

529
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:31,771
Just give me
a credit slip, miss.

530
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,104
Then you can step out from behind
this cage and help me spend it.

531
00:41:35,176 --> 00:41:37,770
That'll be enough
of that.

532
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:40,439
He'll help you
spend your money.

533
00:41:45,853 --> 00:41:48,913
Looks like you got
yourself a reputation.

534
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:51,924
Some folks think I'm almost as
fast as that raider from Missouri.

535
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:54,927
Um, what was his name?
McLyntock?

536
00:41:56,864 --> 00:41:59,992
Friend of yours, honey.
Oh.

537
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:02,467
Laura.

538
00:42:02,536 --> 00:42:05,505
Hello. I'll be
right with you.

539
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,607
Bradley, take the scales
for a moment.

540
00:42:12,846 --> 00:42:17,215
How's everybody upriver? We've been
worried about you. Haven't we, Cole?

541
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:20,685
We're all pretty well. I was
just tellin' Trey about Marjie.

542
00:42:20,754 --> 00:42:23,689
She's all up to her neck
in romance.

543
00:42:23,757 --> 00:42:25,691
Mrs. Prentiss, she's
playin' schoolteacher.

544
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:29,786
Your dad, he's been wonderin'
what kept you in Portland so long.

545
00:42:29,863 --> 00:42:31,990
So have I.

546
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:38,304
Well, I... tell him that I...
Tell him you like it in Portland.

547
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:43,207
Laura doesn't think farming would be
much fun. Frankly, I don't blame her.

548
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:45,643
Uh-huh.

549
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:49,547
That mean you're not goin'
upriver? No, Glyn. / like it here.

550
00:42:49,617 --> 00:42:51,710
It's exciting.

551
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:56,017
We've had such a wonderful time that I guess
you'll have to tell Dad I'm staying here.

552
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:59,025
I think maybe you better
tell him yourself.

553
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:01,527
He's at the dock
with Captain Mello.

554
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:08,199
You might just as well, honey. You're
gonna have to tell him sometime.

555
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,445
I asked you if she was your
girl. That's right, you did.

556
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,946
Hope you don't mind.
I don't.

557
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,246
Where do I find Hendricks?
Never mind. I'll show ya.

558
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:27,685
Maybe you'd better
get back to your work.

559
00:43:30,257 --> 00:43:32,316
Maybe I'd better.

00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:41,500
/t'll run you $850.
/'ll take it in cash.

561
00:43:41,568 --> 00:43:45,971
Those prices are out of line. Take it
or leave it. Tomorrow it'll cost 1,000.

562
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:51,000
And next week, you won't get it at any price.
This is the last load going upriver this winter.

563
00:43:51,078 --> 00:43:54,309
We'll take it,
but it's robbery.

564
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,315
Come on.

565
00:43:58,752 --> 00:44:01,346
Hello, McLyntock.

566
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:03,982
How goes things
at the settlement?

567
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,925
Oh, not bad.
Kinda short on food.

568
00:44:06,994 --> 00:44:09,622
Wonderin' why our supplies
haven't been sent upriver.

569
00:44:09,697 --> 00:44:13,497
Had trouble getting it from San Francisco.
Soon as they come in, I'll ship 'em to you.

570
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:17,298
Uh-huh. When'll that be? Two or
three weeks. A month at the most.

571
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:21,467
There's a lot of ice along the riverbank.
Couple more weeks, it might be frozen solid.

572
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:25,945
Don't worry. If it freezes, I'll pack
your supplies up. What if we get snow?

573
00:44:26,013 --> 00:44:29,471
Don't argue with me! If you're not satisfied
with your deal, I'll give you back your money.

574
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:34,112
I want those supplies waitin' on the
dock! That's our food. Send it upriver.

575
00:44:34,188 --> 00:44:38,887
Don't tell me what to do! I can get
50 times what you paid for that food.

576
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:42,918
It's gold. Do you understand? Gold.
Here's your money. Gimme that receipt!

577
00:44:42,996 --> 00:44:46,227
Now looka here. You made a
deal, you're gonna stick to it!

578
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,394
There's 100 people dependin'on that
food to see them through the winter.

579
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:53,031
What do you expect 'em to do? Starve
while you feed a bunch of crazy miners?

580
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,337
That's your problem.
I know...

581
00:44:55,409 --> 00:44:58,378
You're the feller I'm lookin' fer. Do
you need more men to load that steamer?

583

them others, and I can do more work than 'em.

Queen? She's being loaded? Yeah.

barrels. I wanna make $10 and a bottle...

00:45:37,117 --> 00:45:39,813
Should've hit him
in the shoulder, kid.

591
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:50,691
Now what? I'm goin' down to
the docks. You wanna come along?

592
00:45:50,764 --> 00:45:53,130

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,101

You sure you wanna come along?
This is a fine time to ask.

608

Stop wastin' lead! We'll ride to the
rapids and pick them up when they come in.

I sure wanna thank you,
Captain Mello. What for?

610
00:47:56,557 --> 00:47:58,923
For gettin' us out of trouble.
Trouble?

611
00:47:58,992 --> 00:48:04,362
That wasn't trouble. Things like that used
to happen down on the Mississippi every day.

612
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:08,367
Ain't that so, Adam? Yes,
but we was younger then.

613
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:11,131
It just requires
a little bit of thinkin'.

614
00:48:11,204 --> 00:48:13,536
Then you better start
thinkin', Captain.

615
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:16,838
Hendricks and his men are headed
for the rapids along the riverbank.

616
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,208
Think we can beat 'em
to it? Not a chance.

617
00:48:19,279 --> 00:48:24,444
They'll be there three, four hours
before we are. Any ideas, Glyn?

618
00:48:24,518 --> 00:48:26,645
I got a few.

619
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,518
Oh, uh...
thanks for your gun.

620
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:32,081
Think you can get along
without it?

621
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,593
I'll get along.
[Chuckles]

622
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:16,268
Didn't Laura talk to you when she got down
to the boat? She didn't tell me about him.

623
00:49:16,336 --> 00:49:20,500
I guess she figured Cole'd make her
a good husband. Maybe she's right.

Yeah?

628
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,728
Can you pull her over
to the bank?

629
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:48,325
I could, but we're 20 odd
miles below the rapids yet.

630
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,462
I know. Just get her over there. Adam!

631
00:49:51,538 --> 00:49:56,305
Put her over to shore. Easy does
it. We don't wanna get hung up.

632
00:49:56,376 --> 00:49:59,038
What happens when we
reach the shore? We unload.

findin' a road across the mountain?

and find one.

of Cap'n Mello's coats and caps...

Where'd it come from?

645

a bit here and there. Do you approve?

we're going to the diggings, but not with you.

doesn't trust Cole.

819
01:04:57,043 --> 01:05:02,242

once a man has gone wrong, that's the end.

No.

about you, Cole.

worried about?

He knows who you are. Or maybe I
should say, he knows who you were.

837

Does he know who you were? No.

838
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:26,626
What happens
when he finds out?

839
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:30,191
Maybe by that time he'll find
out I'm right. You're not right!

840
01:06:30,269 --> 01:06:34,899
They won't let you change. That's why you're
a fool to lug all this food to the settlement.

841
01:06:34,974 --> 01:06:38,774
After you get it there, what happens?
They pay you off with a big "thank you."

842
01:06:38,844 --> 01:06:43,247
Later they find out that you're the McLyntock
that used to raid along the Missouri border...

843
01:06:43,315 --> 01:06:45,283
and then they kick you out. Maybe.

844

Then why not take this stuff
to the gold camp?

or a "thank you" somebody'll take back.

846

Could be they won't
take it back.

847
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:04,329
If they don't, I figure that's
worth more than $100,000.

01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:56,239
What's worryin' you? I heard
those two work good at night.

975
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:58,282
I've seen him
work at night.

976
01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:02,616
Wullie's smart. He'll play it
safe, catch him when he's sleepin'.

977
01:19:02,687 --> 01:19:04,655
[Gunshot]

978
01:19:04,723 --> 01:19:08,056
That was Wullie.
He got him.

979
01:19:08,126 --> 01:19:10,822
That wasn't a six-gun.
It was a rifle.

980
01:19:10,896 --> 01:19:13,387
Wullie didn't have no rifle.

981
01:19:15,734 --> 01:19:17,895
Neither did Lock.

982
01:19:17,969 --> 01:19:19,903
[Gunshot]

983
01:19:19,971 --> 01:19:22,439
That was a rifle too.

984
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:26,739
You satisfied? The trail's
a mile back. Start rollin'!

985
01:19:32,751 --> 01:19:37,017
Going around the canyon won't do any good. As
soon as Glyn finds another spot, he'll stop us.

986
01:19:37,088 --> 01:19:40,524
Without a horse? It's a good trick if
he can do it. We'll have to travel fast.

987
01:19:40,592 --> 01:19:44,858
Long Tom, take the last wagon.
Leave your horse tied off.

988
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:47,228
Drive the lead wagon.
I'll ride herd.

989
01:20:06,618 --> 01:20:09,951
I think it would be better
for you in the front seat.

990
01:20:12,491 --> 01:20:14,925
What's the matter, afraid? Yes!

991
01:20:14,993 --> 01:20:16,153
So am I.

992
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:20,494
Watch your drivin'.
Watch the road!

993
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:24,524
[Long Tom] / just wanted to be sure she was
all right. / wouldn't want her to get hurt.

994
01:20:25,337 --> 01:20:27,464
She's doin' fine.

995
01:21:03,808 --> 01:21:06,106
Whoa!

996
01:21:06,177 --> 01:21:10,113
It'll be easy going after we make the bend
in the river. How far to the gold camp?

997
01:21:10,181 --> 01:21:13,514
Oh, two hours at the most
if we can... [Gunshot]

998

01:21:38,843 --> 01:21:41,004
How'd he get here?

[Gunshot]

1002
01:21:48,954 --> 01:21:51,923
Jeremy.
Come down here.

1003
01:22:06,438 --> 01:22:10,204
Trey's horse was tied to the
tailgate. Did you cut it loose?

1004
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:13,443
Yes.

1005
01:22:14,946 --> 01:22:17,437

[Shouting]

1007
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:24,154
Stop it, Cole,
or I'll kill you!

1008
01:22:31,896 --> 01:22:35,957
I told you
you were too soft.

1009
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,559
I should've killed you.

1010
01:22:38,637 --> 01:22:40,798
Come on!

1011
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:48,441
Use your rifles!
Cover me when I ride through!

1012
01:22:58,823 --> 01:23:00,814
Where're you goin'?

1013
01:23:00,892 --> 01:23:04,384
To the gold camp. Let's see what he
can do against a dozen hungry miners.

1014
01:23:04,462 --> 01:23:07,192
Suppose they don't wanna help
us. Yeah, they'll help us.

1015
01:23:07,265 --> 01:23:10,098
When I tell 'em we got enough
food to last through the winter.

1016
01:23:10,168 --> 01:23:12,602
All right, cover me!

1017
01:23:14,172 --> 01:23:16,163
[Gunfire]

1018
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,547
For the first time
in my life...

1019
01:23:24,616 --> 01:23:27,551
I want to see a man killed.
[Gunfire Continues]

1020
01:23:35,694 --> 01:23:39,095
Well, he made it.
Yeah, he made it.

1021
01:23:39,164 --> 01:23:41,655
What about McLyntock?
Maybe we killed him.

1022
01:23:41,733 --> 01:23:46,067
No, you didn't.
Drop 'em!

1023
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:55,211
Let 'em go.

1024
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:59,546
All right, now pick up those rifles.
We may need them. All right, Glyn.

1025
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:01,744
I knew you'd get here.
I'm here.

1026
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:04,653
Now let's get across the river.
Are you able to drive? I'll drive.

1027
01:24:04,723 --> 01:24:07,521
I'll drive one too. You think
you can handle a four-up?

1028
01:24:07,592 --> 01:24:11,858
I can try. All right! Come
on, Trey. Let's get the cattle.

[Mooing]

1030
01:24:38,957 --> 01:24:43,291
Put 'em in, Jeremy. Keep 'em movin'!
Laura, keep up close to the lead wagon.

1031
01:24:43,361 --> 01:24:45,454
Come on!
Get up there! Ho!

1032
01:24:56,941 --> 01:24:58,875
Can you make it?
Yes!

1033
01:24:58,943 --> 01:25:01,343
All right, come on! Come on! Giddap!

Come on, boys! Come on, boys!

1036
01:25:14,492 --> 01:25:17,518
Get over there!
Come on, horses!

1037

[Screams]

1046
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:28,087
Let's get out of here!

1047
01:28:57,815 --> 01:29:00,875
I'm sorry, Glyn.
Did the rope burn your neck?

1048
01:29:04,655 --> 01:29:08,648
[Chuckles]
No, you didn't do that, Trey.

1049
01:29:08,726 --> 01:29:12,218
That's been there
for quite a while.

1050
01:29:12,296 --> 01:29:15,925
Since you were a raider
on the Missouri-Kansas border?

1051
01:29:20,038 --> 01:29:23,201
And some vigilantes
tried to hang a gunman.

1052
01:29:25,343 --> 01:29:28,073
Just one of those
rotten apples?

1053
01:29:29,847 --> 01:29:32,281
I was wrong.

1054
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:35,911
There is a difference
between apples and men.

1055
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:39,320
Really, there is.

Good man, Jeremy!
I knew you'd do it!

1060
01:30:05,016 --> 01:30:08,543
You're talkin' to the wrong man.
See the fellow in the third wagon.

1061
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,558
Whoa! Then you did come up to see me.

1062
01:30:18,629 --> 01:30:21,427
[Chuckles] Just for a visit.
I had nothing else to do.
