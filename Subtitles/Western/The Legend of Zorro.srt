" The legend of the zorro " 
Translated for * Euzonemais * 

2 
00:01:34,040--> 00:01:37,100 
1850 -the people of California 
poor and desperate it is about... 

3 
00:01:37,780--> 00:01:40,140 
joining at the same time to the union 
that becomes the third state... 

4 
00:01:41,150--> 00:01:43,450 
I lower the governor's regime 

5 
00:01:45,620--> 00:01:47,980 
a voting is the key 
of its destiny 

6 
00:01:49,200--> 00:01:52,350 
and of its promise of freedom. 

7 
00:02:09,570--> 00:02:10,750 
Inácio 

8 
00:02:11,730--> 00:02:12,490 
What are you making? 

9 
00:02:13,700--> 00:02:15,020 
Playing the bells... 

10 
00:02:15,720--> 00:02:18,100 
so that if there is 
problems, the zorro is knowing 

11 
00:02:19,190--> 00:02:21,570 
If I don't make a mistake, Zorro... 
it is already here 

12

Legend Esp. and Sync: Cyberpunk 
Translation of * * *EUZONEMAIS * * * 

13 
00:03:14,840--> 00:03:16,690 
It doesn't think you would owe 
to be in the school? 

14 
00:03:16,850--> 00:03:18,450 
Priest... 
Zorro will come 

15 
00:03:18,860--> 00:03:21,340 
I will certify myself that him 
come to see you.  What do you find? 

16 
00:03:22,050--> 00:03:22,960 
Does he/she speak serious? 

17 
00:03:32,320--> 00:03:34,140 
The earth is not worth anything else 

18 
00:03:34,290--> 00:03:36,120 
We have to wait that the rest 
of California it is not lost 

19 
00:03:36,910--> 00:03:37,990 
Light that for the governor 

20 
00:03:38,710--> 00:03:39,460 
Brother 

21 
00:03:39,800--> 00:03:40,540 
carefully 

22 
00:03:40,610--> 00:03:41,850 
Our future 
it is in its hands 

23 
00:03:42,450--> 00:03:43,160 
Yes, gentleman 

24 
00:03:45,750--> 00:03:48,270 
That area is 
a lot it pacifies.... 

25 
00:04:11,470--> 00:04:13,650 
The most recent model 
of weapon of high caliber... 

26 
00:04:14,260--> 00:04:15,260 
Henry of two loads 

27 
00:04:15,770--> 00:04:19,240 
If God was here, 
with certainty, he/she would bring one of those 

28 
00:04:19,320--> 00:04:20,630 
What does bring it here McGibbons? 

29 
00:04:22,410--> 00:04:23,700 
I didn't still vote 

30 
00:04:23,800--> 00:04:25,260 
Oh! that grieves... 

31 
00:04:25,300--> 00:04:26,800 
...mas, the votings are shut 

32 
00:04:27,400--> 00:04:28,860 
That I don't think right 

33 
00:04:29,290--> 00:04:30,390 
I am also entitled 

34 
00:04:31,300--> 00:04:32,430 
Now, it could be gentile... 

35 
00:04:32,500--> 00:04:33,650 
and to give me that box 

36 
00:04:33,860--> 00:04:34,760 
And I will follow my road 

37 
00:04:35,960--> 00:04:38,500 
He/she will only do with that the people 
vote again 

38 
00:04:38,890--> 00:04:40,060 
but he/she remembers... 

39 
00:04:40,560--> 00:04:42,120 
Babylon was in ashes 

40 
00:04:42,640--> 00:04:46,140 
for blame of the inferior race 

41 
00:04:46,500--> 00:04:49,270 
I come to do the work of God 
with that voting 

42 
00:05:09,920--> 00:05:11,250 
It is hour of doing the work 
of you 

43 
00:05:20,170--> 00:05:20,930 
Zorro! Zorro! 

44 
00:05:21,650--> 00:05:22,570 
Zorro! Zorro! 

45 
00:05:29,780--> 00:05:30,500 
Move! 

46 
00:06:09,130--> 00:06:11,560 
Zorro! Zorro! 

47 
00:10:13,630--> 00:10:14,910 
On the hill, 
for the governor's house 

48 
00:10:17,110--> 00:10:20,750 
We are going, I said on the hill 
for the governor's house 

49 
00:10:43,180--> 00:10:45,750 
Zorro! Zorro! 

50 
00:10:53,130--> 00:10:54,520 
Zorro! Zorro! 

51 
00:10:55,440--> 00:10:56,260 
What was? 

52 
00:10:56,920--> 00:10:57,720 
Where are my men? 

53 
00:10:57,960--> 00:10:58,960 
They were arrested, Governor... 

54 
00:10:58,990--> 00:11:01,060 
And I helped them 

55 
00:11:07,410--> 00:11:10,530 
Zorro! Zorro! 

56 
00:11:12,260--> 00:11:13,280 
Zorro! Zorro! 

57 
00:11:15,730--> 00:11:17,020 
Citizens of São Mateu 

58 
00:11:17,660--> 00:11:19,560 
In the day today, we joined 
to the union... 

59 
00:11:20,000--> 00:11:21,290 
as a free state 

60 
00:11:25,290--> 00:11:26,450 
the peace is just the beginning 

61 
00:11:26,670--> 00:11:27,450 
Inside of three months 

62 
00:11:27,880--> 00:11:30,150 
all the votes of everybody the towns 
of the california 

63 
00:11:30,490--> 00:11:31,640 
counted seram 

64 
00:11:32,020--> 00:11:33,210 
And I wait 

65 
00:11:33,620--> 00:11:35,170 
that finally, we will be called 

66 
00:11:35,870--> 00:11:37,450 
North American 

67 
00:11:48,530--> 00:11:50,740 
Zorro! Zorro! 

68 
00:11:53,220--> 00:11:57,860 
Zorro! Zorro! 

69 
00:12:40,450--> 00:12:43,400 
See, see as the stirrup 
he/she is crowding together, friend. 

70 
00:13:12,520--> 00:13:13,800 
Speak to me what won 

71 
00:13:14,840--> 00:13:15,760 
tell me that are free 

72 
00:13:17,320--> 00:13:18,200 
We are free 

73 
00:13:22,220--> 00:13:23,230 
For continuing together 

74 
00:13:23,310--> 00:13:24,070 
For us 

75 
00:13:28,160--> 00:13:29,600 
I would like to have accompanied you 

76 
00:13:30,860--> 00:13:32,840 
It would like 

77 
00:13:34,920--> 00:13:36,130 
I cannot believe in you 

78 
00:13:37,340--> 00:13:38,650 
We have our turn lives 

79 
00:13:39,380--> 00:13:41,880 
Now we can take 
Joaquim for Spain... 

80 
00:13:42,100--> 00:13:44,200 
...eu doesn't imagine as 
it should have been moving 

81 
00:13:44,390--> 00:13:46,940 
It is New York 
we should see New York 

82 
00:13:48,440--> 00:13:51,320 
It is as if everyone 
it had moved 

83 
00:13:51,350--> 00:13:53,540 
in a great city 

84 
00:13:53,810--> 00:13:54,820 
I was thinking 

85 
00:13:54,860--> 00:13:55,860 
That is not a good sign 

86 
00:13:57,990--> 00:13:59,050 
In California... 

87 
00:13:59,300--> 00:14:00,790 
he/she will still have movement 
next 3 months. 

88 
00:14:01,850--> 00:14:02,720 
Yes 

89 
00:14:02,970--> 00:14:04,300 
The federal ones 
they could need help 

90 
00:14:04,650--> 00:14:06,290 
until they have the 
total controls 

91 
00:14:08,790--> 00:14:10,470 
He/she looks at, I know what you are thinking, 
Elena.. 

92 
00:14:11,590--> 00:14:13,590 
Elena, Elena listens to me... 

93 
00:14:14,080--> 00:14:15,930 
We are close of being free 

94 
00:14:19,160--> 00:14:20,560 
I don't get to believe in you 

95 
00:14:21,460--> 00:14:23,080 
I cannot believe that 
I feel like this... 

96 
00:14:24,110--> 00:14:25,630 
Its husband promised to renounce 

97 
00:14:25,870--> 00:14:27,260 
And the frank wife, believed in him 

98 
00:14:27,720--> 00:14:29,250 
How could I be so stupid? 

99 
00:14:30,170--> 00:14:31,240 
You are exaggerating 

100 
00:14:32,530--> 00:14:33,440 
Exaggerating? 

101 
00:14:34,340--> 00:14:35,550 
You promised 

102 
00:14:35,840--> 00:14:37,680 
We made a promise 

103 
00:14:38,070--> 00:14:39,380 
You are getting lost completely 
of its son's life. 

104 
00:14:39,890--> 00:14:42,330 
No, not I am not 
lost of anything 

105 
00:14:42,870--> 00:14:43,740 
- Serious? 
- Serious 

106 
00:14:44,670--> 00:14:45,550 
How is its teacher's name? 

107 
00:14:46,130--> 00:14:49,630 
That is very easy, 
he/she calls himself Mr. Irmão ...Sr. Father 

108 
00:14:50,100--> 00:14:52,340 
King, Jim, Huffer? 

109 
00:14:53,530--> 00:14:56,030 
Good, I have a terrible memory 
What does that, prove? 

110 
00:14:56,300--> 00:14:57,600 
That doesn't know its own son 

111 
00:14:58,440--> 00:14:59,560 
And worse still... 

112 
00:15:00,160--> 00:15:01,380 
He doesn't know you 

113 
00:15:02,180--> 00:15:03,270 
What does prefer that I do? 

114 
00:15:03,540--> 00:15:04,880 
To live as a foreman 

115 
00:15:05,110--> 00:15:06,340 
Only giving orders to the servants 

116 
00:15:06,540--> 00:15:07,610 
Is it that what it believes that I do? 

117 
00:15:07,920--> 00:15:10,360 
Only ordering the servants 

118 
00:15:11,000--> 00:15:12,030 
Don't repeat my words 

119 
00:15:12,470--> 00:15:13,740 
The people need Zorro 

120 
00:15:13,800--> 00:15:16,010 
No, you need Zorro 

121 
00:15:17,440--> 00:15:19,490 
Look at for my eyes, and speak to me 
that is deceived. 

122 
00:15:26,480--> 00:15:27,800 
He/she remembers than 
did he/she tell me? 

123 
00:15:28,370--> 00:15:29,460 
When was Joaquim born? 

124 
00:15:31,120--> 00:15:33,270 
My family is my life 

125 
00:15:34,850--> 00:15:36,090 
He/she knows the all it is lucky 

126 
00:15:36,620--> 00:15:37,570 
when arriving here 

127 
00:15:38,700--> 00:15:39,740 
with life 

128 
00:15:40,340--> 00:15:42,480 
and that its enemies 
they didn't discover, who we are 

129 
00:15:43,970--> 00:15:45,700 
For ten years 

130 
00:15:46,530--> 00:15:47,750 
You have been fighting 

131 
00:15:48,170--> 00:15:49,270 
to take California to the freedom 

132 
00:15:50,500--> 00:15:51,610 
Because not ours 
freedom? 

133 
00:16:05,600--> 00:16:06,970 
They are calling you 

134 
00:16:09,700--> 00:16:10,890 
That is what I am, Elena 

135 
00:16:11,990--> 00:16:12,840 
That is what I am 

136 
00:16:17,460--> 00:16:19,300 
What happened with the man 
with which I got married? 

137 
00:16:19,870--> 00:16:21,920 
What happened with the woman 
what did to my side fight? 

138 
00:16:22,020--> 00:16:23,770 
I had a son 

139 
00:16:24,210--> 00:16:25,020 
Ok... 

140 
00:16:25,240--> 00:16:26,800 
You turned into one 
aristocrat 

141 
00:16:27,150--> 00:16:28,840 
that doesn't have idea from where it comes 

142 
00:16:29,180--> 00:16:30,550 
And that doesn't import it anything 
plus than only to herself. 

143 
00:16:34,570--> 00:16:35,690 
To do for that door... 

144 
00:16:36,760--> 00:16:38,080 
...não will sleep here that night. 

145 
00:16:40,110--> 00:16:41,920 
Perhaps, I should take a suitcase 

146 
00:16:44,660--> 00:16:46,820 
I wait that you and Tornado 
be happy together 

147 
00:16:48,290--> 00:16:49,220 
We will be 

148 
00:16:50,600--> 00:16:52,320 
I love you 

149 
00:18:01,420--> 00:18:05,390 
I see with my eye that 
something that begins with... 

150 
00:18:05,420--> 00:18:06,390 
H " 

151 
00:18:07,230--> 00:18:09,170 
Why dad didn't drink coffee with us? 

152 
00:18:09,540--> 00:18:11,190 
I already told you, he left early 
to do some business 

153 
00:18:11,830--> 00:18:14,200 
He/she always has business 

154 
00:18:14,720--> 00:18:15,750 
It is like this 

155 
00:18:16,460--> 00:18:17,940 
Then, what does he make? 

156 
00:18:19,050--> 00:18:20,630 
Good, he is a boss... 

157 
00:18:21,490--> 00:18:22,690 
and he/she meets with other bosses 

158 
00:18:23,100--> 00:18:23,920 
and they discuss 

159 
00:18:24,010--> 00:18:25,380 
plans and investments 

160 
00:18:25,800--> 00:18:27,720 
it is very important 

161 
00:18:28,000--> 00:18:30,150 
Then the time passes 
counting the money? 

162 
00:18:30,740--> 00:18:31,870 
Joaquim! 

163 
00:18:32,050--> 00:18:33,550 
Be not so rude with its father 

164 
00:18:34,360--> 00:18:36,200 
You resemble him, a lot 
plus than you imagine 

165 
00:18:37,090--> 00:18:38,860 
Could we speak later about that? 

166 
00:18:41,840--> 00:18:43,050 
I love you 

167 
00:20:17,440--> 00:20:18,420 
Who are you? 

168 
00:20:18,840--> 00:20:21,790 
The question Mrs. of her Vega 
is it, who are you? 

169 
00:20:22,560--> 00:20:24,180 
The devote wife of a rich Sr? 

170 
00:20:24,670--> 00:20:28,400 
Or a woman captured by the 
secrets of its husband? 

171 
00:20:31,290--> 00:20:31,990 
What do want? 

172 
00:20:34,060--> 00:20:34,950 
Its help 

173 
00:20:46,400--> 00:20:47,410 
One 

174 
00:20:48,090--> 00:20:49,240 
I will tell you something Of her Vega 

175 
00:20:49,720--> 00:20:51,000 
The women say that only want 
a thing of us... 

176 
00:20:51,030--> 00:20:52,890 
When in fact, they want... 

177 
00:20:52,920--> 00:20:53,890 
...tudo. 

178 
00:20:55,190--> 00:20:58,120 
Light as some vacations 
of the torture of the marriage. 

179 
00:20:58,970--> 00:21:02,530 
You think the women 
they get married because they want to pass 
more time with the husband? 

180 
00:21:04,160--> 00:21:06,220 
It is crazy 

181 
00:21:07,580--> 00:21:08,610 
Then, it lets me to understand that 

182 
00:21:09,450--> 00:21:10,510

I will finish my days in a room 
full of skinned men 

184 
00:21:17,540--> 00:21:18,490 
Thank you for the advice, but not. 

185 
00:21:19,630--> 00:21:21,340

187 
00:21:24,690--> 00:21:26,800

I will see you in the confession box, 
my daughter 

218

00:23:08,120--> 00:23:10,880 
No, I didn't come, to lower yours 
moral, but yes to increase it 

221 
00:23:11,370--> 00:23:12,610 
Who told you that 
did I need that? 

222 
00:23:14,140--> 00:23:16,190 
Alejandro, you are being 
an obstinate 

223 
00:23:16,800--> 00:23:18,580 
Because it won't be with elena and he/she tells it 
what was deceived? 

224 
00:23:19,080--> 00:23:20,560 
She is to who wanted to live like this 

225 
00:23:20,930--> 00:23:21,980 
That stopped being who I am 

226 
00:23:22,540--> 00:23:24,110 
That California would live without me 

227 
00:23:25,180--> 00:23:26,300 
He/she wakes up, friend 

228 
00:23:26,520--> 00:23:27,780 
I have not been playing 
the bell for 3 months... 

229 
00:23:27,810--> 00:23:28,780 
It should be happy... 

230 
00:23:28,810--> 00:23:29,780 
I am 

231 
00:23:30,270--> 00:23:30,970 
Certain 

232 
00:23:31,540--> 00:23:32,890 
Now he/she can run in the sun 
for ever 

233 
00:23:33,370--> 00:23:34,760 
It swallows it that night 

234 
00:23:35,090--> 00:23:36,030 
and take it for celebrating that night 

235 
00:23:36,400--> 00:23:37,850 
All my life is a party 
Thank you, but not 

236 
00:23:39,100--> 00:23:40,040 
As to prefer 

237 
00:23:40,460--> 00:23:42,530 
But it is not irritated in coming to admit, 
why won't I forgive you 

238 
00:23:44,420--> 00:23:46,320 
It blackmails my soul 

239 
00:23:47,880--> 00:23:48,740 
Of course yes 

240 
00:23:54,410--> 00:23:55,350 
Now 

241 
00:23:55,970--> 00:23:57,950 
Somebody more he/she wants to interrupt 
the lesson with a... 

242 
00:23:58,440--> 00:24:00,020 
can I go to the bathroom "? 

243 
00:24:00,820--> 00:24:01,530 
Hm? 

244 
00:24:02,050--> 00:24:02,810 
No 

245 
00:24:04,870--> 00:24:08,360 
Who can tell me what means 
that word? 

246 
00:24:10,580--> 00:24:11,770 
Joaquim? 

247 
00:24:14,750--> 00:24:16,060 
Joaquim Of her Vega! 

248 
00:24:19,050--> 00:24:22,270 
Perhaps, he/she can say to the class, which 
it means for you 

249 
00:24:24,980--> 00:24:27,900 
without more explanations of the 
oppressions of the rich ones 

250 
00:24:28,290--> 00:24:32,130 
they want to oppress us with the injustices 

251 
00:24:32,620--> 00:24:36,080 
and as it explains, as if 
it inserts that idea 

252 
00:24:36,980--> 00:24:38,490 
it fits... 

253 
00:24:39,450--> 00:24:40,440 
in its behind 

254 
00:24:49,950--> 00:24:51,830 
I will give you something for you to laugh 

255 
00:24:57,620--> 00:24:59,120 
It comes here 

256 
00:25:26,140--> 00:25:29,130 
Better, that I don't get you to reach 

257 
00:25:39,790--> 00:25:40,610 
for inside 

258 
00:25:55,240--> 00:25:56,310 
What was with you? 

259 
00:25:57,120--> 00:25:59,090 
Thank for they catch not you 
and they arrested you for a lifetime 

260 
00:26:00,430--> 00:26:01,720 
It arrives, don't give me excuses 

261 
00:26:02,200--> 00:26:03,290 
Why does continue seeking fights? 

262 
00:26:03,910--> 00:26:06,790 
you don't understand, sometimes 
it is necessary to fight 

263 
00:26:06,820--> 00:26:07,460 
Oh, truth 

264 
00:26:07,570--> 00:26:08,350 
Who does that say? 

265 
00:26:08,960--> 00:26:09,900 
He said that 

266 
00:26:14,800--> 00:26:15,580 
Listen 

267 
00:26:16,430--> 00:26:19,230 
He doesn't think like this, the fights nor 
it is always the answer 

268 
00:26:19,330--> 00:26:20,560 
You as he/she knows, what is the one what he/she thinks? 

269 
00:26:20,580--> 00:26:23,300 
trust me, I know it more 
that you can believe 

270 
00:26:23,330--> 00:26:24,080 
It is not correct 

271 
00:26:24,270--> 00:26:26,150 
You were never in a fight, 
in its life 

272 
00:26:26,510--> 00:26:28,150 
Not even, it fought for the mom 

273 
00:26:28,880--> 00:26:31,590 
I am its father, rapazinho 
don't speak like this to me 

274 
00:26:31,620--> 00:26:34,560 
There is not anything in that world, that I don't do 
for you and for its mother, you understand 

275 
00:26:48,580--> 00:26:49,750 
Small José 

276 
00:26:50,240--> 00:26:52,210 
It is igualzinho to its mother 

277 
00:26:53,130--> 00:26:54,580 
Look at for you, Joaquim 

278 
00:26:54,940--> 00:26:56,480 
It is growing so fast 

279 
00:26:57,230--> 00:26:58,410 
if I negotiate it to continue growing 

280 
00:26:58,500--> 00:27:00,630 
We can pay it very shortly 

281 
00:27:00,670--> 00:27:02,160 
I told you godfather that 
it was a present 

282 
00:27:02,390--> 00:27:03,490 
for my afilhado 

283 
00:27:05,340--> 00:27:07,200 
That knife costs 2 Dollars. 

284 
00:27:11,250--> 00:27:13,820 
Good, I will give you 500 dollars for her 

285 
00:27:14,180--> 00:27:17,600 
But, perhaps me her light for my ranch 
with your gratitude 

286 
00:27:17,700--> 00:27:19,810 
For you, we won't sell anything 

287 
00:27:22,140--> 00:27:26,420 
To dead men like you, me 
I am with its wives 

288 
00:27:27,220--> 00:27:28,430 
They said that they won't sell, Mister 

289 
00:27:32,240--> 00:27:33,680 
Had we known each other already before? 
Mister 

290 
00:27:35,860--> 00:27:37,910 
I would remember one 
man like you 

291 
00:27:38,900--> 00:27:42,190 
And I would remember one 
mexicaninho like you 

292 
00:27:43,000--> 00:27:44,440 
dad. he/she will cry teeny 

293 
00:27:45,930--> 00:27:46,870 
Leave it alone 

294 
00:27:52,580--> 00:27:56,250 
Mr. as horseman, I owe 
to teach my son 

295 
00:27:59,130--> 00:28:00,260 
Is everything well gentlemen? 

296 
00:28:02,240--> 00:28:04,130

I respect, respect 

298 
00:28:10,320--> 00:28:11,670 
Think of my offer 

299 
00:28:12,070--> 00:28:14,560 
I will be grateful 

300 
00:28:56,850--> 00:28:58,940 
10 min. then I am leaving 

301 
00:28:59,770--> 00:29:02,950 
mmm, that is delicious 

302 
00:29:03,160--> 00:29:04,820 
Who did give you permission to drink? 

303 
00:29:05,500--> 00:29:08,340 
he/she never understands me, I should take advantage of 
As it goes 

304 
00:29:08,670--> 00:29:09,840 
He/she doesn't have more medicine 

305 
00:29:10,280--> 00:29:12,880 
It arrived at little time 

306 
00:29:13,690--> 00:29:15,680 
he/she is the only person of Dom Galo 

307 
00:29:16,330--> 00:29:17,280 
A French count, do you say? 

308 
00:29:17,660--> 00:29:20,300 
It was probably robbed, the 
its title 

309 
00:29:20,680--> 00:29:22,310 
Perhaps a fine perfume 

310 
00:29:24,000--> 00:29:26,080 
He/she would have to avoid to pay 

311 
00:29:29,240--> 00:29:29,960 
Are you? 

312 
00:29:31,800--> 00:29:33,620

00:32:03,040--> 00:32:03,850 
Elena 

345 
00:32:04,340--> 00:32:05,060 
Armad 

346 
00:32:05,950--> 00:32:06,740 
Of la Vega 

347 
00:32:07,540--> 00:32:08,270 
Conde 

348 
00:32:08,740--> 00:32:09,900 
Do they know each other? 

349 
00:32:10,170--> 00:32:12,900 
We talked a little 
in the table of the foods 

350 
00:32:13,110--> 00:32:14,640 
And it seems that divided 
plus than that 

351 
00:32:15,580--> 00:32:18,610 
Allow to clear up me a little 
the situation 

352 
00:32:18,870--> 00:32:21,620 
Elena mentions it as 
a man of excellent education 

353 
00:32:21,730--> 00:32:23,730 
It is a honor to be mentioned... 

354 
00:32:23,880--> 00:32:26,710 
When he/she asked me the 
I divorce 3 months ago 

355 
00:32:26,730--> 00:32:30,030 
Me abençoo its union, thank you 
for inviting us 

356 
00:32:30,060--> 00:32:30,840 
we have something urgent to do 

357 
00:32:30,900--> 00:32:34,750 
Be not not well educated Felipe 

358 
00:32:39,560--> 00:32:42,730 
It will be in another ocasião,temos many 
guests for recepcionar 

359 
00:32:44,930--> 00:32:46,340 
Armand, good night 

360 
00:32:46,560--> 00:32:49,500 
governor, thank you for having come 

361 
00:32:49,610--> 00:32:50,980 
It lets me to come 
my wife Maria 

362 
00:32:51,160--> 00:32:53,120 
Its speech was very touching 

363 
00:32:53,530--> 00:32:56,390 
I am happy that won't order the 
my husband for an office 

364 
00:32:56,930--> 00:33:00,920 
He/she would not dare to challenge 
to the liberator of the california 

365 
00:33:01,290--> 00:33:04,100 
I fear that doesn't remain a lot of 
union here, governor 

366 
00:33:04,660--> 00:33:09,880 
Gentlemen, allow to present them 
to the colonel, of the infantry of the alabama 

367 
00:33:09,920--> 00:33:11,270 
What did bring it here, colonel? 

368 
00:33:11,660--> 00:33:12,980 
the aroma of the war, wanted 

369 
00:33:13,440--> 00:33:16,990 
When California goes of the union 
the army will be smaller 

370 
00:33:17,520--> 00:33:19,740 
my country doesn't have problems 

371 
00:33:19,890--> 00:33:22,580 
ah, Armand knows like me me 
I upset with it politicizes her 

372 
00:33:22,810--> 00:33:23,510 
We will dance 

373 
00:33:23,540--> 00:33:24,310 
Clear 

374 
00:33:24,250--> 00:33:25,100 
With its permission, gentlemen 

375 
00:33:25,880--> 00:33:27,160 
Gentlemen and ladies 

376 
00:33:27,800--> 00:33:29,690 
The imperial orquesta 

377 
00:33:38,890--> 00:33:40,770 
He/she is sure in doing that 

378 
00:33:40,920--> 00:33:43,200 
Perhaps if I placed some lipstick 
in you, it would seem with my mother 

379 
00:33:53,970--> 00:33:56,220 
Then, that man leaves you 
dazzled 

380 
00:33:56,540--> 00:33:57,400 
How did he/she guess? 

381 
00:33:57,440--> 00:33:58,330 
you know to who I refer 

382 
00:33:58,440--> 00:34:01,960 
Elena worries me 

383 
00:34:05,360--> 00:34:08,010 
You wanted to stand back of all this 

384 
00:34:08,120--> 00:34:09,840 
From when, do you like of it politicizes? 

385 
00:34:09,950--> 00:34:11,670 
From when you worry with 
what do I think? 

386 
00:34:17,670--> 00:34:19,390 
If he/she wants it, go speak to him 

387 
00:34:20,080--> 00:34:21,240 
I cannot support it 

388 
00:34:23,390--> 00:34:24,940 
We have to go auspiciously of that position 

389 
00:34:24,970--> 00:34:26,080 
but me not 

390 
00:34:30,100--> 00:34:31,580 
He/she should tell me as he/she met him 

391 
00:34:32,320--> 00:34:33,540 
in the court of Spain 

392 
00:34:34,140--> 00:34:35,470 
We finished the together school 

393 
00:34:35,540--> 00:34:37,930 
that I border, they finished together 

394 
00:34:38,250--> 00:34:39,820 
he/she didn't want to be embarrassed 

395 
00:34:39,910--> 00:34:41,180 
It excuses, very late 

396 
00:34:46,110--> 00:34:47,120 
As soon as 

397 
00:34:47,540--> 00:34:48,580 
Do tell me count? 

398 
00:34:48,910--> 00:34:53,380 
When its position stops being Conde 
and does he/she become Duke? 

399 
00:34:53,470--> 00:34:55,450 
It is actually very common 

400 
00:34:55,760--> 00:34:56,750 
As to be A Talent 

401 
00:35:00,360--> 00:35:01,740 
It is a beauty 

402 
00:35:02,210--> 00:35:04,300 
it is rich, beautiful and of the royalty 

403 
00:35:04,570--> 00:35:06,350 
There is something that I can tell you 
for you to go auspiciously 

404 
00:35:06,450--> 00:35:08,860 
Yes, that kneels down and ask 
to return with you 

405 
00:35:08,890--> 00:35:10,190 
clear, but I don't want to ruin 
my dress 

406 
00:35:10,470--> 00:35:12,740 
But, I like to be single 

407 
00:35:12,790--> 00:35:13,910 
That, I have to be zealous 

408 
00:35:13,940--> 00:35:14,660 
yes 

409 
00:35:14,770--> 00:35:17,960 
Tell me who was, taking care of Joaquim 
while its mother leaves at night 

410 
00:35:18,130--> 00:35:21,380 
I don't leave, I take care of Joaquim, 
then it is leaving 

411 
00:35:22,720--> 00:35:23,580 
I loosen 

412 
00:35:23,620--> 00:35:25,540 
Finally, why I understand 
he/she left me Elena 

413 
00:35:25,550--> 00:35:28,120 
He/she was embarrassed of being married 
with somebody poor like me 

414 
00:35:28,130--> 00:35:28,860 
no, it is not right 

415 
00:35:28,900--> 00:35:32,660 
Its father was very happy 
that took its place... 

416 
00:35:32,760--> 00:35:34,160 
Lower the voice 

417 
00:35:34,220--> 00:35:35,670 
Congratulations highness! 

418 
00:35:45,710--> 00:35:47,880 
If it is that that thinks of me, 
perhaps... 

419 
00:35:48,160--> 00:35:49,570 
...nunca met me 

420 
00:36:10,120--> 00:36:13,170 
Thank you, for its hospitality 

421 
00:36:13,620--> 00:36:14,460 
Conde 

422 
00:36:50,250--> 00:36:53,420 
I think will need reinforcements 

423 
00:37:12,140--> 00:37:15,010 
he/she doesn't forget of something, stupid 

424 
00:37:19,820--> 00:37:21,530 
Conde Armand 

425 
00:37:23,110--> 00:37:26,710 
Its fine wine and yours 
foreign accent 

426 
00:37:27,690--> 00:37:29,520 
Like her it can be with one 
man as that 

427 
00:37:30,220--> 00:37:34,630 
I will do with that he/she wishes me of turn, 
with that crawls of love for me 

428 
00:37:35,160--> 00:37:39,160 
Nobody leaves my hot tequila 
forgotten in the wind 

429 
00:38:00,610--> 00:38:01,710 
My God 

430 
00:38:33,840--> 00:38:35,370 
an alms, alms 

431 
00:38:36,550--> 00:38:39,380 
an alms, God the abençoe 

432 
00:38:41,130--> 00:38:42,090 
That kind 

433 
00:38:42,450--> 00:38:44,030 
It was to impress you 

434 
00:38:46,750--> 00:38:48,660 
Yes, with certainty, he/she wants to impress me 

435 
00:38:49,330--> 00:38:50,740 
It invites me for having dinner that night 

436 
00:38:52,110--> 00:38:53,190 
Make something delicious for me 

437 
00:38:54,600--> 00:38:56,290 
Good, we will have dinner then in its farm 

438 
00:38:56,890--> 00:38:57,750 
I would like to know its son 

439 
00:38:58,620--> 00:39:00,100 
Try to understand Armand... 

440 
00:39:00,550--> 00:39:02,990 
... My .o son is not still ready for 
to see me with other man 

441 
00:39:03,310--> 00:39:04,450 
Yes, I understand 

442 
00:39:06,460--> 00:39:07,250 
What was? 

443 
00:39:09,560--> 00:39:10,430 
Those hats 

444 
00:39:10,840--> 00:39:12,390 
They are pretty 

445 
00:39:12,840--> 00:39:13,420 
Oh! 

446 
00:39:14,770--> 00:39:16,160 
To want... 

447 
00:39:16,610--> 00:39:17,350 
...eu can buy them for you. 

448 
00:39:18,670--> 00:39:20,930 
Although, thinking well, 
So that he/she wanted another hat 

449 
00:39:21,710--> 00:39:22,880 
The one that me precise 

450 
00:39:25,100--> 00:39:26,470 
A pipe! 

451 
00:39:26,910--> 00:39:27,680 
A pipe? 

452 
00:39:28,070--> 00:39:29,020 
As in the one that my father smoked 

453 
00:39:29,780--> 00:39:32,150 
I hope is not inconvenienced with mine 
extranhos habits 

454 
00:39:32,740--> 00:39:35,090 
No, not to the I thwart 
they surprise me 

455 
00:39:36,620--> 00:39:37,650 
Hear, look at for there, there is a salesperson 

456 
00:39:38,730--> 00:39:40,310 
- Wait for me here 
- Yes. 

457 
00:39:45,940--> 00:39:47,300 
What do you make here? 

458 
00:39:47,330--> 00:39:48,690 
From when you like of

459 
00:39:49,030--> 00:39:49,770 
I don't smoke 

460

I said that for coming undone of him, 
while I came undone of you 

461 
00:39:52,220--> 00:39:53,250 
I have to talk 
with you at night.

00:40:03,560--> 00:40:04,360 
Thank you 

469 
00:40:04,430--> 00:40:05,160 
An explosion 

470 
00:40:05,750--> 00:40:07,090 
In fact, close to its vineyard 

471 
00:40:07,500--> 00:40:09,520 
Something that I had never seen 

472 
00:40:10,420--> 00:40:12,620 
I was only to see they were well 

473 
00:40:13,380--> 00:40:15,510 
As yesterday the night drank too much 

474 
00:40:15,890--> 00:40:17,850 
...com certainty, its vision was 
darken 

475 
00:40:19,190--> 00:40:20,630 
But shortly it was clear 

476 
00:40:21,520--> 00:40:23,170 
An advice... 

477 
00:40:24,970--> 00:40:27,800 
Some respect is had by the 
relationship that had with Elena 

478 
00:40:28,480--> 00:40:29,920 
Leave that lives with dignity 

479 
00:40:31,000--> 00:40:33,300 
I have to have certainty that I leave it with 
a good man 

480 
00:40:33,530--> 00:40:34,580 
That I can give you certainty 

481 
00:40:35,600--> 00:40:36,480 
It arrives, it is already enough 

482 
00:40:37,130--> 00:40:38,730 
Alejandro, 
it is hour of you it to go auspiciously 

483 
00:40:39,130--> 00:40:39,890 
Elena please 

484 
00:40:40,710--> 00:40:43,450 
If Alejandro came 
for something at least he/she has to give it 

485 
00:40:45,050--> 00:40:48,090 
Perhaps we can arrange that as 
gentlemen 

486 
00:40:49,320--> 00:40:50,780 
Did it already play pole, certain? 

487 
00:40:51,780--> 00:40:53,100 
Of course yes 

488 
00:40:53,470--> 00:40:56,550 
I suggest, that we play 
as it is played in my earth. 

489 
00:40:56,800--> 00:40:57,590 
Beautiful city 

490 
00:40:57,980--> 00:40:58,750 
Parents 

491 
00:40:59,090--> 00:41:00,470 
Naturally 

492 
00:41:06,160--> 00:41:09,550 
- Can I offer it something to drink? 
- Tequila with salt 

493 
00:41:26,640--> 00:41:30,110 
Perhaps a poker departure 
it would be less harmful for its health 

494 
00:41:56,550--> 00:41:59,501 
Did he/she fall it something? 
or does he/she only rest? 

495 
00:42:02,041--> 00:42:04,322 
He/she knows, I think I like 
he/she gave game 

496 
00:42:04,842--> 00:42:06,542 
Promise me, that when 
to lose, he/she will leave us alone 

497 
00:42:07,132--> 00:42:08,442 
What does make you to think that I will lose? 

498 
00:42:09,133--> 00:42:10,453 
Feminine intuition 

499 
00:42:52,421--> 00:42:55,342 
For the winner 
there are not pretexts 

500 
00:42:59,583--> 00:43:01,253 
Now, maintain yours 
promise and leave 

501 
00:43:02,013--> 00:43:03,193 
He/she cheated, 
it is not worth like this 

502 
00:43:03,953--> 00:43:05,014 
Good-bye Alejandro 

503 
00:43:05,014--> 00:43:06,014 
What does know about that name? 

504 
00:43:11,445--> 00:43:12,865 
We should never have ourselves married 

505 
00:43:20,427--> 00:43:21,377 
He/she doesn't love him 

506 
00:43:22,047--> 00:43:23,647 
After 10 years of 
marriage with me 

507 
00:43:24,217--> 00:43:25,608 
It cannot hide 
the truth 

508 
00:43:38,860--> 00:43:41,661 
The cantineiro, heard in its tavern 
of here in front... 

509 
00:43:42,111--> 00:43:43,741 
McGibbons to say 
its names.... 

510 
00:43:43,991--> 00:43:45,482 
...que would do 
something for Cortez 

511 
00:44:39,122--> 00:44:40,463 
Its father asked me for 
to look for you... 

512 
00:45:10,429--> 00:45:11,239 
Cortez! 

513 
00:45:17,370--> 00:45:20,101 
The writings, please 

514 
00:45:42,945--> 00:45:44,095 
Non Guilhermo, not give 

515 
00:45:46,036--> 00:45:47,036 
Please, gentleman 

516 
00:45:47,256--> 00:45:48,876 
That earth is everything that we have 

517 
00:45:49,076--> 00:45:51,077 
" You, it had expelled them 

518 
00:45:52,087--> 00:45:52,997 
before you leave 

519 
00:45:53,437--> 00:45:54,227 
that them 

520 
00:45:54,277--> 00:45:55,758 
possess its lands " 

521 
00:46:00,709--> 00:46:04,129 
Salvation and curse 

522 
00:46:04,319--> 00:46:05,690 
He/she has a thing in common 

523 
00:46:05,730--> 00:46:08,620 
He/she has to die for one of the two 

524 
00:46:08,890--> 00:46:09,701 
Serious? 

525 
00:46:13,171--> 00:46:14,261 
Play the weapons 

526 
00:46:16,942--> 00:46:17,822 
Everybody 

527 
00:46:24,403--> 00:46:26,304 
Guilhermo, Blanca 
they are going for inside 

528 
00:46:34,105--> 00:46:35,856 
You are a blind mexicaninho 

529 
00:46:36,036--> 00:46:37,896 
he/she doesn't know where he/she is entering 

530 
00:46:38,656--> 00:46:39,677 
It is much less you 

531 
00:47:35,898--> 00:47:37,498 
don't allow that hurt you 

532 
00:47:38,018--> 00:47:39,308 
I won't leave, I promise you 

533 
00:50:39,064--> 00:50:40,435 
Guilhermo, please speak to me 

534 
00:50:43,375--> 00:50:44,645 
He/she speaks to me 

535 
00:50:45,226--> 00:50:48,236 
please, guilhermo 

536 
00:51:07,330--> 00:51:08,760 
What is that you try to tell me? 

537 
00:51:09,490--> 00:51:12,321 
Without importing that decision takes 
I always make a mistake 

538 
00:51:12,371--> 00:51:13,901 
I failed with everybody 
that I love 

539 
00:51:14,401--> 00:51:16,052 
My wife, my son 
and now with the people also 

540 
00:51:16,672--> 00:51:17,942 
What does want of me? 

541 
00:51:30,645--> 00:51:31,745 
It helps me 

542 
00:51:32,855--> 00:51:34,355 
I always hear my heart 

543 
00:51:36,186--> 00:51:38,756 
He/she speaks to me 
for the love of God 

544 
00:51:39,966--> 00:51:42,277 
Guillermo Cortez was 
only the beginning 

545 
00:51:42,477--> 00:51:44,317 
It is now Elena it is 
running a lot of danger 

546 
00:51:44,807--> 00:51:45,918 
Then, I beg it that 

547 
00:51:47,788--> 00:51:48,898 
Give me courage... 

548 
00:51:49,588--> 00:51:50,289 
...e forces... 

549 
00:51:51,899--> 00:51:53,739 
to carry it it chews 
a little more. 

550 
00:51:55,510--> 00:51:57,800 
It helps me to demonstrate that 
Zorro was right 

551 
00:52:46,650--> 00:52:48,610 
It will go to the vineyard 

552 
00:52:49,490--> 00:52:51,721 
We will place a man in the door 
in the case, that is a snare 

553 
00:52:51,801--> 00:52:54,571 
We be had problems with her, 
then it won't serve us more 

554 
00:52:55,532--> 00:52:57,382 
Consider it as one 
acceptable loss 

555 
00:53:21,927--> 00:53:24,587 
Master Armand 

556 
00:53:24,857--> 00:53:25,628 
Please... 

557 
00:53:26,018--> 00:53:26,898 
..desculpe, one moment. 

558 
00:53:46,842--> 00:53:49,212 
That is very beautiful 

559 
00:53:50,112--> 00:53:51,303 
And the one behind that door what is there? 

560 
00:53:52,513--> 00:53:53,683 
The chapel 

561 
00:53:54,193--> 00:53:57,604 
It is a long family tradition 

562 
00:53:57,924--> 00:54:00,164 
I would show you but... 
...não has time. 

563 
00:54:19,298--> 00:54:20,909 
That was delicious 

564 
00:54:23,459--> 00:54:24,439 
It is now 

565 
00:54:25,359--> 00:54:26,820 
Oh! excuse 
I don't smoke 

566 
00:54:29,410--> 00:54:31,061 
Unless it is in my pipe 

567 
00:54:31,241--> 00:54:32,001 
Clear 

568 
00:54:35,081--> 00:54:36,112 
Ah remembered, né 

569 
00:54:37,392--> 00:54:38,132 
That kind 

570 
00:54:39,052--> 00:54:41,023 
But I think I should leave mine 
stomach to improve first 

571 
00:54:44,553--> 00:54:45,573 
Elena... 

572 
00:54:47,364--> 00:54:48,774 
I want to wonder something 

573 
00:54:50,544--> 00:54:52,285 
Something that should wonder 
there is a long time 

574 
00:54:53,875--> 00:54:55,025 
Before that, 
my love. 

575 
00:54:56,726--> 00:54:57,986 
Answer me a thing 

576 
00:54:58,876--> 00:55:00,176 
The one that you to want 

577 
00:55:02,087--> 00:55:03,047 
Where is the bathroom? 

578 
00:55:03,977--> 00:55:05,668 
It would like to clean 
the nose 

579 
00:55:07,828--> 00:55:09,018 
Clear 

580 
00:55:09,788--> 00:55:10,598 
It is in the runner 

581 
00:55:11,469--> 00:55:12,239 
Excuse 

582 
00:55:45,876--> 00:55:46,656 
It excuses Mr. 

583 
00:55:47,356--> 00:55:48,576 
There is somebody that wants to see it 

584 
00:55:50,777--> 00:55:51,867 
He/she said that is important 

585 
00:56:44,117--> 00:56:45,447 
It is a snare 

586 
00:56:53,189--> 00:56:55,119 
As I understand, he has 
the writings 

587 
00:56:55,860--> 00:56:57,740 
But it was necessary to interrupt 
my dinner? 

588 
00:56:58,480--> 00:56:59,290 
I am here 

589 
00:57:00,060--> 00:57:01,881 
but, I think have a problem 

590 
00:57:02,301--> 00:57:04,681 
or he/she should say a zorrinho 
or Zorro? 

591 
00:57:05,311--> 00:57:06,642 
I heard that among the places 

592 
00:57:07,392--> 00:57:09,922 
He/she is a peasant masked as 
Monday hero 

593 
00:57:11,183--> 00:57:13,323 
Men like this, finish always 
in the guillotine 

594 
00:57:22,455--> 00:57:25,015 
They informed me that some of my ships 
it will arrive tomorrow 

595 
00:57:25,825--> 00:57:27,486 
The sailor's anchor 

596 
00:57:28,516--> 00:57:30,997 
The load should arrive here 
the safe 

597 
00:57:32,277--> 00:57:33,197 
Without erross
