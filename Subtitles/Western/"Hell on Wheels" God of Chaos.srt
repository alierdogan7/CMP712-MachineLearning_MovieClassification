2
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:07,765
I asked you here today to acknowledge

3
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,567
the exceptional work you've done.

4
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:14,236
We could not have
come this far without you.

5
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,989
Now tonight
at the 40 mile Celebration,

6
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:20,877
we shall have the pleasure
of entertaining senators,

7
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:24,814
investors and sundry
other dignitaries.

8
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:28,651
And since we are in such short supply

9
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:31,721
of, uh, ladies of repute,

10
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:35,691
you will all be invited to the dance.

11
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,426
Oh!
All right.

12
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,471
But you will have to make
yourselves presentable

13
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:46,017
and behave like the proper
ladies I know you can...

14
00:03:46,183 --> 00:03:48,645
Pretend to be,

15
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,939
but I warn you, pick pockets,

16
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:55,443
Blushingtons, bug hunters
will be severely dealt with.

17
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:59,906
Now, go clean yourselves up.

18
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:03,577
Boys.

19
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,038
How we doing?

20
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:09,651
Getting ready for the dance.
Oh.

21
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:13,753
Listen. Y'all been tailing
Swede like I told you?

22
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,507
We have. But to no avail.

23
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:18,967
He's a slippery bastard, that one.

24
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,261
He rode out of town last night.

25
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,804
You know where he went?

26
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,465
No.

27
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,143
Uh... well, he bought
two bottles of whisky

28
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,728
at the starlight before he left.

29
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,313
Must be going on a bender.

30
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,399
Swede don't drink.

31
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:39,404
Then I guess he's
meeting someone who does.

32
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:49,581
I wasn't there that night.

33
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:53,752
Check the date on my discharge.

34
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,495
I was wounded at Starkville
two weeks before Meridian.

35
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,764
Then how could you know
what happened that night?

36
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:03,678
I stayed in touch with Johnson
and the boys after the war.

37
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:05,567
They told me all about it.

38
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:10,185
And you can still testify
as to why Bohannan had motive

39
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,980
to kill Johnson and this other man?

40
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:16,650
You think I'm crazy?
He already tried to kill me once.

41
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,234
I'll finish the job
if I go back there.

42
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,181
This man, he's not going to give up.

43
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:23,782
You can keep running,

44
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,185
but... one day

45
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,454
he just going to show
up on your doorstep

46
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,455
and kill you dead.

47
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,525
Now.

48
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,295
Let's finish this thing, huh?

49
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,698
Hmm?

50
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:42,050
Now.

51
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:46,038
Hey.

52
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:49,173
That whisky goes to Dan's town.

53
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:50,474
Yes, sir.

54
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,933
Not in your town.

55
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:55,912
I'm going to check 'em later,

56
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:59,005
make sure they ain't light
one or two bottles.

57
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:03,321
Damn it all!

58
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:09,679
Right.

59
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:16,095
You having trouble
with your floorboards, ma'am?

60
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,586
Well, you're very
perceptive, aren't you?

61
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,427
I'm afraid I'm not
much of a carpenter.

62
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:30,597
No, ma'am, you ain't.

63
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,104
Could you possibly help me?

64
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,984
That is, if you're not
busy killing anyone.

65
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,573
Well, sure as heck
can't do any worse.

66
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,159
Great.

67
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,568
You're quite handy
with a hammer and nail.

68
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:18,081
Were you really
a farmer before the war?

69
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:20,023
Is that so hard to believe?

70
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,567
Yes, actually.

71
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:27,355
I find it hard to imagine
you in a domestic setting.

72
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,158
I couldn't, either.
I always had one eye on the door.

73
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,077
So you were married.

74
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,094
Was.

75
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:35,663
Had a son, too.

76
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:39,834
War come along and...
Jumped at the chance.

77
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,603
Mary didn't want me to go, but, ahh.

78
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:47,575
She didn't stand in my way, either.

79
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,536
Now I'd give anything
to be home and just...

80
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,622
So you lost them both?

81
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:01,783
Your wife and your son.

82
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,736
I'm so sorry.

83
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,740
It's all right.

84
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:21,626
That about does it here.
Wait. Please, I'm sorry.

85
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,375
I didn't mean to upset you.
Please, don't...

86
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:41,266
Whatever happened
to your wife and son,

87
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:46,494
please don't let it
kill the man they loved.

88
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:52,657
Sorry, Mrs. Bell.

89
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:58,246
It's too late for that.

90
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,345
Mr. Grant.

91
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,736
I thought you'd be
well on your way by now.

92
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:18,539
Decided to stay.

93
00:09:18,664 --> 00:09:20,774
Is that wise?

94
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,313
I ain't never been accused
of being wise, sir.

95
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,900
So we'll see you
at the dance tonight?

96
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,653
You will if I'm there.

97
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,522
Special ordered from New York.

98
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:37,285
Oh, Thomas.

99
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,759
I cannot accept this.

100
00:09:38,884 --> 00:09:40,794
Oh, it's not a gift.

101
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:44,031
Think of it as payment.

102
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:46,544
For what?

103
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,537
I've invited many potential investors

104
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:51,382
to the celebration this evening.

105
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:54,552
What does that have to do with me?

106
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:57,245
It's become clear to me
that this railroad

107
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,280
could do with a face
other than my own

108
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:01,935
associated with it.

109
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,231
You're thinking of
the fair-haired maiden of the west.

110
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,421
Yes.

111
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:09,609
You think she'll lure the investors.

112
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,071
Like moths to a flame, my dear.

113
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,129
I'll consider it.

114
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:18,868
On one condition.

115
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:25,506
Why is nothing ever
elemental with you?

116
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:27,585
I want to be a part of it.

117
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:30,797
Part of what?

118
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,147
The building of this road.

119
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:33,949
I want to see it through to the end.

120
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:35,969
Do we have a deal?

121
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,514
Your condition is accepted, madame.

122
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:57,298
Sorry.

123
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:32,633
Uh... ahem.

124
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:35,695
I don't... I don't mean to
disturb your prayers, preach.

125
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:39,824
How can I help you, son?

126
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:47,456
Well...

127
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:51,818
I'm on a dark path, sir.

128
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:57,832
Been on it for a while now.

129
00:11:57,957 --> 00:12:00,178
Where does the dark path lead?

130
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,238
More blood.

131
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:06,726
More hatred.

132
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:13,412
I met somebody who reached out to me

133
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:16,652
and asked me to turn
away from the darkness.

134
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:23,076
Been wanting to preach to me,

135
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,457
so...

136
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:29,220
Here's your chance.

137
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:38,205
Ahh.

138
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:46,447
Well, there's a God.

139
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:50,151
That I have no doubt.

140
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:53,064
Um...

141
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,723
But there's a...

142
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:59,487
There's a devil, too.

143
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,097
And you know...
You know what that old...

144
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:05,599
That old devil did?

145
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:08,601
You want me to tell you about that?

146
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:12,792
Yeah?

147
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:19,632
Well, that devil, he, uh,

148
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:24,081
he cut off God's arms.

149
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:26,784
And he hacked off God's legs.

150
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:30,184
And he gouged out his eyes.

151
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,689
Ripped out his tongue
and left him lying there

152
00:13:32,814 --> 00:13:34,689
in a bloody heap on the floor.

153
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,984
But he left God's ears

154
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,194
so he could hear us down here

155
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,333
when we're wailing and thrashing

156
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,803
and praying for his help.

157
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:48,619
But, Brother...

158
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:52,168
There ain't a damn thing
God can do to help us.

159
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:56,544
What are you saying, preacher?

160
00:13:57,742 --> 00:14:01,255
Just choose hate.

161
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,248
It's so much easier.

162
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:17,639
Brother!

163
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:22,987
Choose hate.

164
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:51,307
I thought everybody was
supposed to have the day off.

165
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,524
Everybody but us.

166
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,186
We had no say in it, neither.

167
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,896
Want me to talk to Durant about it?

168
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,775
You sittin' in some mighty high cotton,
ain't you, boy?

169
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:01,931
Watch yourself, son.

170
00:15:02,056 --> 00:15:04,111
I'm still your boss.

171
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:07,532
Who do you think you is in
these fancy clothes, huh?

172
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,200
Who cocked your hat, boy?

173
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,608
You did.

174
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:14,914
Ain't supposed to be our boss, hmm?

175
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,180
You're supposed to be our leader.

176
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:20,450
Thinking you're looking out for us.

177
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,297
Turns out you're just looking
out for your own damn self.

178
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:24,966
Ain't nobody else going to do it.

179
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,091
I ain't your master.

180
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:31,722
You need to look out
for your own self, huh?

181
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:04,463
Carlton.

182
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:10,720
Mr. Bohannan.

183
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,538
Been looking everywhere for you.

184
00:16:13,663 --> 00:16:15,891
What's going on, Sean?

185
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:18,242
I'm just making plans for the Swede.

186
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:20,187
He's just rolled back in.

187
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:21,913
And I don't think he's alone.

188
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:25,016
Oh, yeah?
Who's he with?

189
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:26,902
Well, I didn't hear any names,

190
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:33,081
but he had on a union jacket
with Sergeant Stripes.

191
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:40,499
Sergeant's jacket, huh?

192
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:44,337
Yeah, I think so.
I know we've had our differences...

193
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,632
- Are you sure you saw Sergeant Stripes?
- Yes!

194
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:52,094
Where they at?

195
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,473
Where they at?

196
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,352
Where they at?

197
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,853
Swede's caboose.

198
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,776
Will this make us even for the fight?

199
00:17:12,086 --> 00:17:13,240
Bohannan.

200
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,716
A couple of federal marshals
are coming to arrest me tonight.

201
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,479
For what?

202
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:34,053
Murder.

203
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,097
So why haven't you just up and left?

204
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,973
Sergeant's here.

205
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:40,434
Swede tracked him down.

206
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,603
I reckon he talked him
into testifying against me.

207
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,689
How you know Harper will be
the man you're looking for?

208
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,649
He has to be.
You don't know that.

209
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:49,443
The hell is your stake in all this?

210
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:51,821
I ain't got none.

211
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,156
Why do you even care?

212
00:17:57,496 --> 00:17:59,120
You told me something once.

213
00:17:59,365 --> 00:18:01,997
It was the only thing
that ever set me free.

214
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:04,208
Yeah. What's that?

215
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,378
You got to let go of the past.

216
00:18:26,862 --> 00:18:29,650
You will be the king of the ball.

217
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:34,864
Unfortunately with
no queen by my side.

218
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,491
Are you referring to Mrs. Lily Bell?

219
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:38,749
Hmm.

220
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:42,410
Sir, shall we take a walk?
Hmm?

221
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:50,229
Mr. Gunderson, have you ever had

222
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:53,189
your heart ripped out by a woman?

223
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,302
I was married once, sir,

224
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,604
but she ran off with a gypsy.

225
00:18:57,729 --> 00:18:59,640
My heart was not ripped out,

226
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:03,601
but she did steal my cuckoo clock.

227
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:10,452
Well, my gypsy is Bohannan.

228
00:19:10,577 --> 00:19:12,588
Ahh. Loki, yeah.

229
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:14,289
What?

230
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:16,989
So he and Mrs. Lily Bell.

231
00:19:19,086 --> 00:19:21,563
I gave him a chance to run,

232
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:23,329
but he wouldn't take it.

233
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,624
Run? But why?

234
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,306
Mr. Gunderson,
I told him about the federal marshals.

235
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:33,297
He knows you're up to something.

236
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,644
Ohh.

237
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:37,546
Why did you tell him?

238
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:39,948
I wanted to get rid of him.

239
00:19:40,073 --> 00:19:42,181
The fool wouldn't leave.

240
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,434
Why are you telling me this now?

241
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,523
Because I want you to succeed
in your plan, Mr. Gunderson.

242
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,747
You need to get out of here.

243
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:08,207
Now.
Why?

244
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:11,085
He's coming.

245
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,756
Find a place to hide.
Where?

246
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:17,217
I don't want to know.

247
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,419
Why not?

248
00:20:18,544 --> 00:20:19,760
So Bohannan can't get it out of me.

249
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,688
Now listen, no matter what,

250
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:24,557
you must meet that train
when it arrive.

251
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,475
The marshals will protect you.

252
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:40,740
Where is he?

253
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,659
Where is who?

254
00:20:49,575 --> 00:20:51,667
In the myths of my homeland

255
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,379
there is a God that go
by the name of Loki.

256
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,130
This Loki's the God of chaos.

257
00:21:01,255 --> 00:21:04,305
He causes nothing
but trouble everywhere he go.

258
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:08,972
No matter how hard
the other gods try to catch him,

259
00:21:09,097 --> 00:21:12,108
the slippery little devil
always manages to escape.

260
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:14,023
You have 3 seconds to
tell me where he is.

261
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:17,748
I honestly do not know.

262
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:19,987
If I did, I would not tell you.

263
00:21:22,611 --> 00:21:24,491
Go ahead, kill me.

264
00:21:24,657 --> 00:21:30,998
I go to my grave happy knowing
that I'm the one who'll bring you down.

265
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:37,568
Just as I thought.

266
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:42,545
Killing me does not equate
in your moral mathematics.

267
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:02,613
Eva!

268
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,769
Whoo-ee, darling.

269
00:22:04,894 --> 00:22:08,619
If you ain't slicker
than a fine gentleman's snot rag.

270
00:22:10,703 --> 00:22:12,377
You ain't looking too
shabby your ownself, gal.

271
00:22:12,502 --> 00:22:14,536
Thank you.

272
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:20,050
Where'd you get that pretty thing?

273
00:22:20,175 --> 00:22:22,633
Mrs. Bell gave it to me.

274
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,553
What you doing out here?

275
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:25,928
They're building the town.

276
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,513
A real town.

277
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,560
I've been on the move
for as long as I can remember.

278
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:35,396
Since before them Indians took me.

279
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,268
I was thinking it might be nice

280
00:22:38,393 --> 00:22:41,610
for us to, you know, settle down.

281
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:44,029
What you mean?

282
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:47,533
Well, we're getting hitched,

283
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:52,184
so why not settle down
like a proper man and wife

284
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:54,999
and raise a family.

285
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,875
Getting hitched?

286
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,545
Like we talked about.

287
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,256
I ain't never said nothing
about getting hitched.

288
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,298
But I... I thought the other day

289
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:09,888
you said you wanted me to be yours.

290
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:12,307
I do.

291
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:15,519
Well, I thought that meant...

292
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,979
I just ain't thought
things out that far.

293
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,447
And I sure as hell ain't staying

294
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:22,407
in no Podunk railroad town.

295
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,950
Look at me. Huh?

296
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:33,495
When they freed me,
I ain't have a penny to my name, Eva.

297
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:35,914
Now I work for Mr.
Thomas Durant himself.

298
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,635
Oh, I see.

299
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,920
For the first time in my life,

300
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:43,506
I got money in my pocket.

301
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:47,534
My money in my pocket.

302
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,973
Might be looking at some
kind of real future.

303
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,560
Without me.

304
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,754
No.

305
00:23:57,879 --> 00:23:58,937
I want it with you.

306
00:23:59,103 --> 00:24:01,690
What, as your private whore?

307
00:24:32,178 --> 00:24:34,522
Ahh, yes, good to see you.

308
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:46,318
Imagine it.

309
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,738
A journey that now takes 6 months

310
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:52,075
would be cut to 7 days.

311
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,953
7 days.
It boggles the mind.

312
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,482
You will be able to spend
Christmas in New York and...

313
00:24:59,607 --> 00:25:01,718
New years in San Francisco.

314
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:04,962
Gentlemen, I give you Mrs. Lily Bell.

315
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,922
Ma'am.
Mrs. Bell.

316
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:20,026
There's room on the dance floor.

317
00:25:31,004 --> 00:25:32,948
How you been, Miss Eva?

318
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:38,453
Mr. Toole.

319
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:41,582
Are you not waiting for Mr. Ferguson?

320
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,649
No, I am not.

321
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:47,421
Well, if I'm not
overstepping me bounds,

322
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:51,925
would you do me
the honor of dancing with me?

323
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,403
I'm sorry, Mr. Toole,

324
00:25:54,528 --> 00:25:57,848
I don't much feel
like dancing right now.

325
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:01,010
I understand.

326
00:26:01,135 --> 00:26:03,020
Thank you, ma'am.

327
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:22,247
Mr. Toole.

328
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,764
There was a time out in
the frontier with Robert

329
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,083
when I wondered if
this beautiful landscape

330
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:44,728
might not be better unspoiled.

331
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,022
Part of me still wonders that.

332
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:50,692
But after seeing all these people

333
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:54,446
working so hard to build this road,

334
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,996
after understanding
the sheer audacity

335
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:59,432
of this American endeavor,

336
00:26:59,557 --> 00:27:05,562
well, I see now there
truly is greatness in it.

337
00:27:07,465 --> 00:27:09,378
To Lily Bell,

338
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,478
the fair-haired maiden of the west.

339
00:27:12,603 --> 00:27:14,883
Cheers.
Hear, hear.

340
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,527
You following me?

341
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,174
Oh, no. No, sir.

342
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,324
Just taking the evening air.

343
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,705
What is this?

344
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,124
It's about a payment.

345
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,947
No, not now.

346
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,254
Hey!

347
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,631
Hey! Get your bloody rope off me!

348
00:28:36,797 --> 00:28:39,801
Someone help me.
Get your bloody hands off me!

349
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:41,011
Your bloody hands off me!

350
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,680
Get off!

351
00:28:45,264 --> 00:28:48,268
We're here to collect a debt,
Mr. Swede.

352
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:51,355
You be careful, Irish boy,

353
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,273
what you choose to do now,

354
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:54,691
you son of a bitch, you.

355
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,360
Bloody... aah!

356
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,903
How do you like that?

357
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,029
Aah!

358
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,365
Aah! Uhh!

359
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,991
Bust his head!

360
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:06,370
Bastard! Get your hands
off me, bloody Irish.

361
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,296
Aah! Aah!

362
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:18,423
Aah! Aah!

363
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,176
Gah!

364
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:15,601
Would you like to dance, sir?

365
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:18,513
I'm sure some of these other fellows

366
00:30:18,638 --> 00:30:21,903
are much better dancers than me.

367
00:30:26,713 --> 00:30:30,662
But I don't want these other fellows.

368
00:31:17,728 --> 00:31:20,754
You'll see a lot of perks
working for me, Mr. Ferguson.

369
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,839
Is that right?
Mm-hmm.

370
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:33,225
Excuse me a second.

371
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,726
Ahh.

372
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,065
Elam!

373
00:31:40,516 --> 00:31:41,992
What the hell are you
doing with my woman?

374
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:42,994
Hey, now, Ferguson.

375
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,028
Stop it!

376
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:45,570
Elam, let him go.

377
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:47,122
Come on. Elam!

378
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:07,751
I ain't your woman.

379
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:09,387
You made that pretty clear.

380
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,888
I didn't make nothing clear.
You're still mine.

381
00:32:12,054 --> 00:32:13,765
What, like your property?

382
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:16,394
I'm staying behind, Elam.

383
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,355
It seems like Mr.
Toole has got the same idea.

384
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:22,774
You and him?

385
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,437
No, there ain't no me and him.

386
00:32:25,562 --> 00:32:28,822
We're just two people who don't
want to be vagabonds no more.

387
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:34,327
I love you, Elam,

388
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:37,839
but I'm tired of being a tramp.

389
00:33:53,786 --> 00:33:57,589
Excuse. I'm sorry,
I'm afraid I need to cut in.

390
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,728
Damn it!

391
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,490
We don't have to do this.

392
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:21,682
I wasn't there, Mr. Bohannan.

393
00:35:21,807 --> 00:35:23,317
You're a liar.

394
00:35:23,442 --> 00:35:26,387
Johnson said the Sergeant
strangled my wife.

395
00:35:26,512 --> 00:35:29,223
And I saw the picture.

396
00:35:29,348 --> 00:35:31,671
You was the platoon sergeant.

397
00:35:31,837 --> 00:35:33,047
Not then I wasn't.

398
00:35:33,213 --> 00:35:35,363
You raped and murdered my wife.

399
00:35:35,488 --> 00:35:36,926
I wasn't there.

400
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:38,303
Just admit it.

401
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,567
I can prove it.
No.

402
00:35:40,692 --> 00:35:42,432
You have to be him.

403
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,927
I can prove it.

404
00:36:05,618 --> 00:36:07,415
Uhh!

405
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,128
Uhh!

406
00:36:12,294 --> 00:36:13,880
I...

407
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,673
Uhh!

408
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,562
Ahh!

409
00:37:02,206 --> 00:37:05,208
Uhh.

410
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:42,005
Hey.

411
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,847
I've been looking for you.

412
00:39:43,972 --> 00:39:46,175
I seen the marshals back there.

413
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,378
Oh.

414
00:39:52,648 --> 00:39:54,851
You killed him?

415
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,021
Yeah.

416
00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:03,268
But he wasn't there.

417
00:40:03,393 --> 00:40:06,562
I killed the wrong man.

418
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:12,535
