00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:24,109
Yeah.

Yeah, but I haven't had

Detective, thanks for coming by.

236
00:11:25,304 --> 00:11:26,571
I understand you found the trucker.

237
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,140
It's a good start. What did he say?

238
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,142
We haven't questioned him
yet. He's in my office.

239
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,311
I thought you'd want to hear
what he had to say firsthand,

240
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:36,648
so I gave him a few minutes
to eat and collect himself.

241
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:41,186
So, this rig tries to pass me.

242
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:44,522
And I look over, and the
guy in the passenger seat's

243
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,126
wearing a ski mask, waving a rifle at me.

244
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:49,461
Bastards cut me off.

245
00:11:49,562 --> 00:11:51,930
I hit the brakes as hard as I could.

246
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:54,065
How many other people in that rig?

247
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:58,336
Maybe four of them jumped
out, all wearing masks.

248
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:00,071
They opened fire.

249
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:01,706
I thought they were gonna kill me.

250
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:04,342
But then, I'm getting pulled out,

252
00:12:06,378 --> 00:12:07,645

00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:10,014
any end location they
might take these cattle?

254
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:13,184
No. They barely spoke.

255
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:16,521
Plus, m... my ears were
ringing from the shots.

256
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:18,490
All I remember, uh...

257
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:20,992
is getting tossed in the
trailer with the cattle.

258
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,162
They hooked it up to their rig, took off,

259
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,598
then dumped me in the middle of nowhere.

By "worst" I mean violent.

273
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:16,180
- So, where is he?
- Well, there is that.

end of a reduced sentence

- Yeah.

00:13:25,624 --> 00:13:27,258

00:17:06,495 --> 00:17:10,298
"My farts caused hurricane Sandy."

358
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,466
That was Cooper James' wife.

359
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:14,602
He didn't come home last night.

360
00:17:14,703 --> 00:17:18,606
Coop came in here to
file an incident report.

361
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:21,542
It's right here. Took him 20 minutes.

362
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,245
I know. I saw him go
in there. What happened?

363
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:26,580
Well, he left. I thought
someone was picking him up.

364
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:28,215
But his car is over there.

365
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,388
[Sighs]

366
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:37,725
Where the hell could he have gone?

367
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:44,699
[Engine revs]

368
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,014
Ok.

369
00:18:06,281 --> 00:18:08,382
I got him. [Grunting]

370
00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:12,820
- So, you got my message.
- [Grunting] Yep.

371
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:15,255
Can't say as I saw this coming.

372
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:16,423
[Sighs]

373
00:18:16,524 --> 00:18:18,759
What am I gonna tell his wife?

374
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:20,661
I said we got him back.

375
00:18:20,762 --> 00:18:23,263
This isn't your fault, Vic.

376
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,466
I drop a witness off, and
before they can get home,

377
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,668
these bastards come, and
they hang him in a trailer?

378
00:18:27,736 --> 00:18:31,438
R.J.: Cooper wasn't a
witness. He was in on this.

379
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,607
Partners turned on him.

380
00:18:33,675 --> 00:18:37,311
One less guy to divide the pie with.

381
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:39,647
What makes you so sure?

382
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:42,383
He didn't smell like manure.

383
00:18:42,484 --> 00:18:45,219
- I noticed when we cut him down.
- Spend a couple hours

384
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,920
bouncing around the back
of a truck full of steer,

385
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:48,489
you're gonna smell like cow shit.

386
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,226
Desperate men do desperate things.

387
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:54,662
It leads to this.

388
00:18:56,498 --> 00:19:00,300
If the hijackers killed him
to keep more of the take,

389
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:02,369
why let a cow go in town square?

390
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,371
It's throwing away money.

391
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:05,773
It's a misdirect.

392
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:09,443
They want us running in
circles trying to figure out

393
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:11,712
who hung a stupid sign on a Heifer's neck.

394
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,815
Meanwhile, they bolt off
to Colorado or Kansas,

395
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:16,183
and they sell the rest of their haul.

396
00:19:16,251 --> 00:19:18,519
You're still thinking Dunwood?

397
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,155
Dunwood folds into this somehow.

398
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:23,190
He's killed before.

399
00:19:23,258 --> 00:19:25,325
You're not gonna find that
on his rap sheet, but he did.

400
00:19:25,427 --> 00:19:26,894
Why is that?

401
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:29,897
Because a couple of years
before he went to jail,

402
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:33,701
I had a guy in Dunwood's
crew, my own snitch.

403
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:35,402
Well, Dunwood must have found out about it

404
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:37,037
because I found my guy, too.

405
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:39,840
And his hands were bound behind him,

406
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:41,308
and he was hanging from the rafter

407
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:43,177
of a truck-stop bathroom.

408
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:46,447
That sound familiar?

409
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:49,817
So, then, how do we get Dunwood?

410
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:52,820
Well, there's one thing we can try.

411
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:55,689
We release him on furlough.

412
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,225
We keep an eye on Dunwood. We follow him.

413
00:19:58,326 --> 00:20:00,194
I bet you he'll lead us

414
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:02,429
right to the guys who
helped him pull this off.

415
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,599
I'll think about it.

416
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,768
Right now, I got to notify Cooper's wife.

417
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:10,370
No. I'll tell her.

418
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:22,983
[Sighs]

419
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,224
Mrs. James, I'm sorry to
tell you that we found Cooper.

420
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,960
And he's gone.

421
00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:36,597
He was found...

422
00:20:36,664 --> 00:20:39,566
[Sobs]

423
00:20:55,784 --> 00:20:57,985
[Sighs] Mrs. James...

424
00:20:58,052 --> 00:21:00,988
Don't you touch me!

425
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,756
You lied.

426
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:06,426
Saying everything was
okay, that... oh, God.

427
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:08,729
[Sniffles]

428
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,964
[Sighs]

429
00:21:13,768 --> 00:21:16,403
My oldest son found that three hours ago

430
00:21:16,504 --> 00:21:17,471
on my front doorstep.

431
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:20,040
[Zipper opens]

432
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:29,314
He was like family.

433
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:32,951
Are you sure Cooper was involved?

434
00:21:33,052 --> 00:21:34,986
Looks that way.

435
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:38,723
[Sighs] Well, I am at a loss.

436
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,425
Branch: Looked into your insurance.

437
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:43,795
You tripled your theft
coverage since last year.

438
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:45,530
Why?

439
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:52,737
Well, when you've been robbed before,

440
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:54,272
it's a normal thing to do.

441
00:21:54,373 --> 00:21:58,176
Dale, have you been struggling financially?

442
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:00,211
What, just 'cause I upped my insurance?

443
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,180
Sheriff, that's called being prudent.

444
00:22:02,248 --> 00:22:05,884
Is it prudent to sell underweight cattle?

445
00:22:05,985 --> 00:22:08,386
Why not let them graze and fatten
up all summer, then sell them?

446
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:10,722
Sounds like you needed money.

447
00:22:10,823 --> 00:22:12,157
I did need money, Sheriff.

448
00:22:12,258 --> 00:22:14,092
That's why people sell things.

449
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:16,861
See, I spent too much on feed last fall.

450
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:18,296
I got overextended.

451
00:22:18,364 --> 00:22:20,832
I took it in the balls
in '07 like everyone else.

452
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,167
I got a son and a daughter,

453
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:24,703
both in fancy, east-coast colleges

454
00:22:24,804 --> 00:22:26,738
costing me 80 grand a year.

455
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:29,240
Here's how things look
from where I'm sitting.

456
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:31,109
You got financial trouble.

457
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,278
You tripled your theft insurance.

458
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:36,314
You hired a trusted driver
to do whatever you asked.

459
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:39,851
I didn't steal my own cattle!

460
00:22:39,952 --> 00:22:42,253
And I sure as hell
didn't kill Cooper James.

461
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,255
And you want to talk more about it,

462
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:48,259
you can call my lawyer!

463
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,028
[Door slams]

464
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:54,232
[Clears throat]

465
00:22:56,969 --> 00:22:58,236
Look what showed up on
Cooper James' doorstep

466
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,405
this morning, according to his wife.

467
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:03,208
[Sighs]

468
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:06,211
It's $10,000.

469
00:23:06,312 --> 00:23:09,214
If you're gonna kill Cooper
to cut him out of the deal,

470
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:12,650
why give his wife a
duffel bag full of cash?

471
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:15,186
We got more cattle heading up main street.

472
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:19,057
The question in Durant these
days is, "where's the beef?"

473
00:23:19,158 --> 00:23:21,226
And the answer is, "everywhere you turn."

474

[Cows mooing]

476
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:25,161
Excuse me, ladies.

477
00:23:25,263 --> 00:23:28,865
What do you think about everything
that's going on here today?

478
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:31,067
- Anyone?
- Uh, yeah.

479
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:32,769
I support whoever did this.

480
00:23:32,837 --> 00:23:35,105
The beef industry is destroying our planet.

481
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,640
They cut down rain forests,

482
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:38,642
overbreed in inhumane conditions.

483
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:39,943
Meat is murder.

484
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,645
Thank you, miss.

485
00:23:41,746 --> 00:23:43,213
Omar: Young lady!

486
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:46,116
This is Wyoming. This is beef country.

487
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,251
Now, I respect your right to free speech,

488
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,919
but not your stupidity.

489
00:23:50,021 --> 00:23:51,788
100 years from now,

490
00:23:51,856 --> 00:23:54,257
people will look back
on you as a barbarian.

491
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:57,560
Darling, why do you
think God gave us these?

492
00:23:57,662 --> 00:24:00,196
They're called bicuspids.

493
00:24:00,298 --> 00:24:02,766
They're for tearing meat, not tofu.

494
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:05,835
People like you are destroying this planet!

495
00:24:05,936 --> 00:24:07,137
- Hey!
- It's people like you that are killing...

You. Don't let that guy
get under your skin, okay?

499
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:16,946
You're this close to being
arrested for disorderly conduct.

500
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:18,815
He could file assault charges against you

501
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:20,116
if he really wanted to.

502
00:24:20,217 --> 00:24:21,151
Vic: Go.

503
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,852
Omar, what are you doing?

up, started talking garbage.

fun cost you your first wife?

- All right, I'll ease up.
- No.

I'm looking for a man named Jordan Helms.

Now, the feds say he moves around a lot

517
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:06,262
but might be holed up on the res.

518
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:08,264
First of all, Jordan Helms is

519
00:25:08,366 --> 00:25:11,601
just an activist who
posts lectures on YouTube.

520
00:25:11,702 --> 00:25:13,103
And he is not holed up.

521
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,138
He's a Brit who's shacked up
with his Cheyenne girlfriend.

522

Supposedly, Helms has connections

523
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:19,075
to the E.L.F., Earth Liberation Front.

524
00:25:19,176 --> 00:25:21,778
Supposedly, they sabotaged
a fracking operation

525

in Cumberland County last month.

526
00:25:23,714 --> 00:25:25,281

his activism to a new level.

00:25:45,102 --> 00:25:46,736
Mr. Helms, I'm investigating

535
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,938
the hijacking of a truck full of cattle.

536
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,641
Cattle are showing up with
signs attacking big beef.

537
00:25:51,742 --> 00:25:52,976
[Panting]

538
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:54,844
Shadow said she saw it on the news.

539
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:56,146
I don't watch.

540
00:25:56,213 --> 00:25:59,682
Look at this, then.

541
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,850
[Sighs]

542
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:02,719
[Laughs]

543
00:26:02,787 --> 00:26:04,754
I don't know anything about it.

544
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,857
[Sighs] That said,

545
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:10,593
I wholeheartedly support whoever did.

546
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,963
And civil disobedience is a
powerful weapon to enact change.

547
00:26:14,064 --> 00:26:17,934
I've seen what arrogant
actions can do to an empire.

548
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:22,806
The Cheyenne people,
they respect the earth.

549
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,974
She needs our support.

550
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,844
Am I right, brother?

551
00:26:27,945 --> 00:26:31,548
I suppose... brother.

552
00:26:31,615 --> 00:26:33,817
Walt: You reach a lot of
people with your videos.

553
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,853
My deputy tells me you have
50,000 followers on Facebook.

554
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:39,122
This is a war.

555
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,525
I'm fighting for the
planet. It can get ugly.

556
00:26:42,626 --> 00:26:45,695
Yeah, real ugly. Like murdering ugly.

557
00:26:45,796 --> 00:26:48,598
I thought you said it was
a cattle-truck hijacking.

558
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:50,533
The man driving the truck was killed.

559
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:54,204
Look... I want to be clear.

560
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:56,306
I could not and would not ever support

561
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,408
any action that results in violence.

562
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,711
I had nothing to do with this.

563
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:04,214
Unless posting those
speeches on the Internet

564
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:06,749
inspired some unhinged people.

565
00:27:06,817 --> 00:27:09,118
Then you had a hell of a lot to do with it.

566
00:27:09,186 --> 00:27:12,755
This is America, where
people are supposed to

567
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:16,292
take responsibility for their own actions.

568
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:20,730
[Cellphone rings]

569
00:27:20,831 --> 00:27:22,899
- Hello?
- R.J.: Moretti. Is the Sheriff with you?

570
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,903
Yeah, hang on a second. Walt.

571
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:28,505
Heya, Walt.

572
00:27:28,632 --> 00:27:31,134
Did "Johnny Greenpeace" confess?

573
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,635
Walt: Nope.

574
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:34,971
Yeah, I didn't think so.

575
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,974
I had the D.A. draw up papers
for Dunwood to be furloughed.

576
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:40,243
Excuse he's gonna be given is budget cuts.

577
00:27:40,344 --> 00:27:42,011
Final step, I need you to sign off, Walt.

578
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,980
Hey, pull over here.

579
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,988
Did you, uh, find out where
Dunwood's prison buddies

580
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:54,023
went to work after their release?

581
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:56,726
I got my deputy working on that.

582
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:59,295
She's preoccupied at the moment.

583
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:01,664
R.J., send the furlough
papers to the station.

584
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:03,666
I'll sign them.

585
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:05,435
[Engine shuts off]

586
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:09,339
- Stop messing with me!
- Walt: Hey! Hey!

587
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,541
- How do you not remember?
- I don't remember.

588
00:28:11,642 --> 00:28:13,209
- Take a breath. Take a breath.
- That's bullshit! Where's the card?

589
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:15,311
- Where's the card?
- Okay, I may... I may have lost it.

590
00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:16,980
What's going on? This job
is a lot of responsibility.

591
00:28:17,081 --> 00:28:18,147
I'm just trying to learn the ropes here.

592
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:20,016
- [Sighing] Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry!

593
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:22,552
Bob, retrace your steps.

594
00:28:22,653 --> 00:28:24,554
Find the card that went with those flowers.

595
00:28:24,655 --> 00:28:26,923
[Sighs]

596
00:28:28,225 --> 00:28:30,159
[Ice shifts]

597
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,295
Find that card, Bob.

598
00:28:41,998 --> 00:28:44,399
Okay. Okay.

599
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,067
R.J.: You know, I've
put 16 guys behind bars

600
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:47,569
in the last 10 years.

601
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,405
Every single one of them are out.

602
00:28:50,506 --> 00:28:52,941
Most of them went back rustling.

603
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:55,710
- What was his name?
- Who?

604
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:58,780
Your informant... the one
you said that Dunwood hanged.

605
00:28:58,848 --> 00:29:02,417
Davy Wilson.

606
00:29:02,518 --> 00:29:05,420
He was a good guy. He didn't deserve that.

607
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:07,088
You do what we do,

608
00:29:07,156 --> 00:29:10,625
the people you work
with become like family.

609
00:29:10,693 --> 00:29:13,628
My dad did this, you know? Oh, yeah.

610
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:15,630
Yeah, he was the real deal.

611
00:29:15,698 --> 00:29:18,500
He was a tom horn sort of stock detective.

612
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:21,436
You didn't tussle with
him and get off easy.

613
00:29:21,504 --> 00:29:25,440
Old bastard died in the line of duty.

614
00:29:25,508 --> 00:29:30,145
Drove his truck off the
road chasing a stolen haul.

615
00:29:30,246 --> 00:29:34,749
I guess I'd do the same if I had to.

616
00:29:34,817 --> 00:29:37,085
People think cattle rustling's a joke.

617
00:29:37,153 --> 00:29:40,455
Well, it ain't a joke. It ruins lives.

618
00:29:40,523 --> 00:29:43,892
My dad... Davy.

619
00:29:43,993 --> 00:29:45,994
[Sighs]

620
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:47,829
[Chuckling] Besides, I don't know

621
00:29:47,897 --> 00:29:49,731
what the hell else I'd do besides this.

622
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,066
What about you?

623
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:53,134
If I don't get re-elected next month,

624
00:29:53,236 --> 00:29:54,869
I'll have an answer for you.

625
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:57,472
Well, if I was a resident,
I would vote Longmire.

626
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,673
[Laughs]

627
00:29:58,741 --> 00:30:00,542
Have you ever considered relocating?

628
00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:02,444
[Laughing] No. Hell, I'm too old to move.

629
00:30:02,545 --> 00:30:03,778
[Laughs] [Cellphone rings]

630
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:06,114
Oh.

631
00:30:06,182 --> 00:30:08,650
Yeah. Watts here.

632
00:30:08,718 --> 00:30:10,085
Yeah, yeah, he's here. Hang on.

633
00:30:10,186 --> 00:30:11,853
Hey, Vic. You okay?

634
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:13,655
Yeah. [Sighs]

635
00:30:13,723 --> 00:30:15,657
I'm fine.

636
00:30:15,725 --> 00:30:19,527
So, uh... Branch is still
going through the visitors log,

637
00:30:19,629 --> 00:30:21,529
but I found out that
in the last six months,

638
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:23,865
13 inmates have been
released from State Pen Ranch.

639
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:25,867
And all of them have ranch jobs,

640
00:30:25,935 --> 00:30:28,203
but one guy named Whitey Culver

641
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:30,105
works at the Triangle Arch Ranch.

642
00:30:30,206 --> 00:30:32,107
- Good work, Vic.
- Vic: Right.

643
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:36,177
I heard her. Her...
voice really cuts through.

644
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:38,513
So, it looks like we've got
our connection to Dunwood.

645
00:30:38,581 --> 00:30:41,850
You stay tight on him. I'm
gonna go talk to this cowhand.

646
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:49,124
Dale.

647
00:30:49,225 --> 00:30:51,493
I don't see a lawyer
there with you, Sheriff.

648
00:30:51,594 --> 00:30:53,561
Look, I'm just trying to figure this out.

649
00:30:53,663 --> 00:30:55,563
Now, I'll ask a question.

650
00:30:55,665 --> 00:30:57,198
You don't want to answer
it, that's your call.

651
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,768
You got a hand named Whitey Culver?

652
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:02,537
Yeah. He's working now. Why?

653
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,039
Were you aware that whitey served some time

654
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,740
at the State Pen Ranch?

655
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:08,009
He got locked up for a bar
fight that went too far,

656
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,544
not for rustling.

657
00:31:09,612 --> 00:31:11,880
Whitey served with a
guy named Bobby Dunwood,

658
00:31:11,947 --> 00:31:14,582
one of the biggest rustlers in Wyoming.

659
00:31:14,684 --> 00:31:16,618
So, I'm gonna need to talk to whitey.

660
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:18,620
He lied to me.

661
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:20,522
He told me he never met a one.

662
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,023
Well, it's true what they say, isn't it?

663
00:31:22,124 --> 00:31:24,993
No good deed goes unpunished, does it, son?

664
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:27,595
I'll go get him.

665
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:31,666
[Sighs]

666
00:31:33,969 --> 00:31:36,104
Sugarloaf... that's in Maine, right?

667
00:31:36,172 --> 00:31:37,605
Yeah.

668
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:38,940
You go to college up there?

669
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,175
Yep, one more year to go.

670
00:31:40,242 --> 00:31:41,776
Dale: Here he is, Walt.

671
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:45,680
Talk to the man.

672
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:47,482
Is there a problem, Sheriff?

673
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:49,617
You know Bobby Dunwood, don't you?

674
00:31:49,685 --> 00:31:51,986
No. [Scoffs]

675
00:31:53,222 --> 00:31:56,491
A l... little bit. But I... 

676
00:31:56,592 --> 00:31:58,993
Ah, Whitey. You're fired.

677
00:31:59,095 --> 00:32:00,662
Dale, hang on a sec.

678
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:04,165
You been in touch with Dunwood
since you were released?

679
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:06,034
Hell no.

680
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:10,071
Mr. Lowry, haven't I always
done a good job for you here?

681
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:13,441
You know, I had good intentions hiring you.

682
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,744
But now I can't afford to trust you.

683
00:32:18,247 --> 00:32:19,647
Walt: Whitey.

684
00:32:21,517 --> 00:32:23,084
The truth is all I'm looking for.

685
00:32:23,185 --> 00:32:25,019
I didn't steal no cattle, Sheriff.

686
00:32:25,087 --> 00:32:26,888
- Trent.
- Trent: Yes, sir?

687
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:29,457
Will you come pick up
your cows? I got no space.

688
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:30,825
Today good?

689
00:32:30,926 --> 00:32:32,460
Sure thing, Sheriff.

690
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:34,462
Okay.

691
00:32:34,563 --> 00:32:36,931
Come on, Whitey.

692
00:32:37,032 --> 00:32:39,801
Omar: Can't Vicky take my complaint?

693
00:32:39,902 --> 00:32:41,803
No. Branch will be back soon.

694
00:32:41,904 --> 00:32:44,672
Oh, come on, Walt. Do I have to do this?

695
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,542
Got no issues with that granola girl.

696
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:49,544
- I like pushy women.
- [Door closes]

697
00:32:49,645 --> 00:32:50,879
Just do what I ask you to do.

698
00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:52,514
Ruby: Walt.

699
00:32:52,581 --> 00:32:54,682
Trent Lowry's here for the cows.

700
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,586
Uh, I just need you to sign
some paperwork in my office.

701
00:32:59,555 --> 00:33:00,855
After you.

702
00:33:06,729 --> 00:33:08,496
Amy?

703
00:33:08,502 --> 00:33:10,003
Hey. You're here.

704
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:13,006
They're trying to charge me
for bumping some old, crazy guy.

705
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:14,407
You two know each other?

706
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:17,043
I guess you met at college in Maine.

707
00:33:17,144 --> 00:33:18,745
Freeport College, is it?

708
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:21,014
I noticed your T-shirt this
morning in the town square.

709
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:22,515
I assume you two are dating.

710
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,584
- Yeah.
- Is that against the law?

711
00:33:24,685 --> 00:33:26,453
Depends on what you do on your date.

712
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,421
I just got one question for you, Trent.

713
00:33:29,156 --> 00:33:30,990
Are you okay with Whitey
Culver getting fired

714
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:32,726
for a crime he had nothing to do with?

715
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:34,327
I don't know that he had
nothing to do with it.

716
00:33:34,428 --> 00:33:36,963
Yeah, you do. You both do.

717
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:38,698
Men rustle cattle to make money.

718
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,034
They're not interested in
advancing a political agenda.

719
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:42,602
<i>But you are.</i>

720
00:33:43,504 --> 00:33:48,108
Amy, are you familiar with
a man named Jordan Helms?

721
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:50,977
Yeah. So are a lot of people.

722
00:33:51,078 --> 00:33:53,680
He has a very impressive
Facebook page, lots of friends.

723
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:58,952
They leave comments like, uh,
"big beef destroys the planet.

724
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:00,920
It's time to stop
talking and start acting."

725
00:34:00,988 --> 00:34:02,622
You recognize that?

726
00:34:03,924 --> 00:34:05,925
It's got your picture
and your name next to it,

727
00:34:05,993 --> 00:34:09,863
along with another 46 comments by you.

728
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,998
It's not against the law to
express an opinion, is it?

729
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:14,667
No. But it sure gives you a motive.

730
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,904
And he's opportunity son of a rancher.

731
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:19,439
Look, Sheriff... isn't it your job

732
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,940
to find criminals who deserve punishment?

733
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:23,309
So, why not arrest the board of B.P.?

734
00:34:23,377 --> 00:34:24,844
Their greed and negligence resulted in

735
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:29,549
172 million gallons of crude
oil being spilled into the Gulf.

736
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,918
They're the real criminals.

737
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,421
- What are you doing?
- [Handcuffs click]

738
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:37,557
What is this? What are you doing?

739
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:41,728
You can't do this.

740
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:42,996
Actually, I can.

741
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:44,798
When you murder someone, you go to jail.

742
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:46,966
Cooper James, the trucker
hauling those cattle,

743
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:50,603
he was murdered, hung by the neck.

744
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,639
You scared now?

745
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,642
Wait. We never hurt anyone.

746
00:34:55,743 --> 00:34:57,677
Those cows were never really stolen.

747
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:59,446
We're releasing all of them.

748
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:02,916
It was just a hoax to raise awareness.

749
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,451
We paid Cooper $10,000

750
00:35:04,552 --> 00:35:06,786
to shoot up that rig and switch trailers.

751
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,556
- That's all.
- That's a crime.

752
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:13,560
Cooper needed that money
for his family. All right?

753
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:16,062
This was supposed to help
everybody get what they wanted.

754
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,597
Nobody was supposed to die.

755
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:19,299
<i>Why would we kill Cooper?</i>

756
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,502
You two take a moment and
talk amongst yourselves.

757
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:24,370
Good luck.

758
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:26,372
So, you think they did it?

[Sighs]

760
00:35:28,142 --> 00:35:29,709
Well, they stole the cattle,

761
00:35:29,777 --> 00:35:32,312
but I don't think they killed Cooper James.

762
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:33,880
Well, who else would want Cooper dead?

763
00:35:33,948 --> 00:35:35,949
They're the only ones who
knew he was involved in this.

764
00:35:38,152 --> 00:35:42,055
No. They weren't.

765
00:35:50,923 --> 00:35:52,457
Yeah. Watts here.

- Walt: R.J.
- Oh, hey, Walt.

767
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,128
Hey, you talk to that cowhand
over at Triangle Arch yet?

768
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,497
Walt: He's clean, but we made an arrest.

769
00:35:59,565 --> 00:36:01,833
Turns out the rustlers
weren't really rustlers at all.

770
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:03,167
Dale Lowry's son, Trent,

771
00:36:03,268 --> 00:36:05,470
he did something stupid
for a girl he loves.

772
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:06,504
We have a confession.

773
00:36:06,572 --> 00:36:08,005
Well, h... hold on, Walt.

774
00:36:08,106 --> 00:36:10,875
You... you think a college
kid killed that trucker,

775
00:36:10,943 --> 00:36:12,877
strung him up like that?

776
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:14,479
Tell you what, let me talk to him.

777
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,013
You over at the station?

778
00:36:16,114 --> 00:36:19,016
Walt: Nope. I'm driving
out to the State Pen Ranch.

779
00:36:19,117 --> 00:36:21,552
What are you doing that for?

780
00:36:21,653 --> 00:36:23,221
Walt: Dunwood has nothing
to do with this case.

781
00:36:23,288 --> 00:36:24,922
It's time to end his furlough.

782
00:36:25,023 --> 00:36:27,258
Pick him up and meet me
back at the State Pen Ranch.

783
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,793
Yeah, s... sure, Walt.

784
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:30,862

00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:42,707
There he goes.

00:36:42,774 --> 00:36:44,275
So, what now?

788
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:46,310
We wait.

789
00:36:49,214 --> 00:36:52,083
Bob Barnes found the card
that went with your flowers.

790
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,852
He dropped it off.

Who's it from?

794
00:37:13,605 --> 00:37:15,172
Come on, Vic.

795
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,210
After all this, you're not
gonna tell me what it says?

[Inhales deeply]

797
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:25,216
It says "happy anniversary."

I thought your anniversary was in October.

799
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,222
It is.

800
00:37:34,793 --> 00:37:36,060

- Dunwood with you?
- Yeah, I got him.

We're heading back to State Pen Ranch.

See you in about... 10, 15.

No, you won't.

819
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:38,623
You got your own plans for Dunwood,

820

same as you had for Cooper James.

Look, j... just stay tight,
and... and I'll see you soon.

I'm bringing Dunwood in.

824
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:53,170
Then why are you driving
in the wrong direction?

825
00:38:53,238 --> 00:38:56,641
Why you following me?

826
00:38:56,742 --> 00:39:00,144
Why are you heading out of town, R.J.?

'Cause I'm going home.

There's not gonna be
any more hangings, R.J.

Look... that thing with Cooper...

831

I didn't mean for that to happen.

Yeah, I followed your deputy
and him back to the truck depot.

833

But... h... he didn't smell like cattle.

I just noticed it a little
quicker than you did.

835
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,635
And when I pressed him
on it, he kept lying.

836

And I hate a liar. Can't stand one.

837
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,839
I knew damn well he stole them.

838
00:39:28,907 --> 00:39:31,509
He did. But not for Dunwood.

839
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,878
He was working with the rancher's son.

840
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:35,212
I told you I got nothing to do with this.

841

has ruined enough lives.

if I'm gonna give him
another slap on the wrist
