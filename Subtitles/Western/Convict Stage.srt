- Did they get 'em?

- Locked up in Apache Wells.
- Don't worry about it, old girl.

We'll ride in and bust 'em
out like we did before.

Well, this is a different

And the kids killed a girl,
so nobody has any sympathy for them-

- not even for littleJohnny.
- That fool kid's trigger happy.

- He's been asking for this.
- Hold your tongue, Adam Scott!

- He's my baby.
- That's one tough baby.

Well, he had good teachers-
you and me and the rest of this outfit.

49
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,348
Look, Jeb had the same teachers,
but he doesn't go around shooting women.

50
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,412
Johnny had to shoot
that girl.

51
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,390
His mistake was not to make
sure that she was dead...

52
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,622
like mine was not to make
sure that Lattimore was dead.

53
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,290
- Well, isn't he?
- No.

54

to worry about too.

He has sworn to kill them.

Over her grave.

- She'd understand.
- I don't.

60
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,630
- Well, Sis grew up with guns around her.
- And died by one.

61
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,935
- So the men who killed her will have to pay for it.
- They've been caught, Ben.

- They're in jail.
- They've been in jail before and got away!

00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:31,813
I don't like ridin' on rough roads
with loaded shotguns.

167
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,849
Sometimes they just
go off by themselves.

168
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:41,729
So I'll just keep ol' Betsy
pointed at you two...

169
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,734
in case that happens.

170
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,072
Now they were here yesterday,
but they're not here today.

171
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,415
Why?

172
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,479
Could it be that somebody might have
warned the marshal that I was coming?

173
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,722
Yup. Telegraph key.

174
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,856
Now he didn't take 'em
outta town on horseback...

175
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,991
so he must've used
the stage.

176
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,195
What stage, mister?

177
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,970
Well, now, I ain't at liberty to tell you
anything, Mr. Lattimore.

178
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,509
Now come on, now.
Put that thing away.

179
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,482
Unless I'm misinformed, you never shot
an unarmed man before.

180
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,850
Well, I never had any
cause to until now.

181
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,481
[Sighs]
Well, the marshal's my friend.

182
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,889
He told me not
to tell you anything.

183
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,427
Now if that's cause
for killin', go ahead.

184
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,861
Well, say I had shown up
unexpectedly.

185
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,263
Would you have helped
him stand me off?

186
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,632
Not me or anybody else.

187
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,434
We don't care how Jeb
and Johnny Sims die, just so they die.

188
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,737
Well, they got a lot
of friends in the territory...

189
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,800
friends that might help
them if they had a chance.

190
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,847
Now if I don't kill them,
they just may not die.

191
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:06,111
Well, now, I'll tell ya, their friends ain't
gonna get 'em outta territorial prison.

192
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:09,483
- [Laughs]
- Well, thanks.

193
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,285
- Did I say anything for you to thank me for?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

194
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:16,521
Now, do you know of anybody around
here that's got a good horse for sale?

195
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:21,658
Mine's just about had it, and it's a long,
long ride to the territorial prison-

196
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,600
even if you know
the shortcut.

197
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,266
Let's get outta here, Dix.

198
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,538
That's my old man
over there, Marshal.

199
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,654
Horses gone. Old man dead.
Indian boys gone.

200
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,893
- You think they killed him?
- No. Good boys.

201
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,958
Take a look around
while I get a shovel.

202
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:34,369
- Too bad.
- He was a no-good old drunk.

203
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:39,638
- So? Leave him to buzzards.
- You don't do that to your old man, Piute.

204
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,105
Somebody please
help me down.

205
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,675
You stay where you are, ma'am.
We may have to get outta here in a hurry.

206
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,717
Any signs to tell ya
who might've done it?

207
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,386
No. Looks like they
wanted the horses.

208
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,952
Or maybe they didn't
want us to have 'em.

209
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,123
Dix, I know how you feel
about your old man...

210
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,190
but we gotta get outta here
fast, son.

211
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,259
I'm buryin' him,
and that's that.

212
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,166
Lady, I told you
to stay put.

213
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,712
Them that done this
might still be around.

214
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,407
Oh, dear. I didn't
think of that.

215
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,883
Since I'm down, I might as well
stay down, hmm?

216
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:25,321
- I'll take a look at your bag.
- What on earth for?

217
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,324
Women have been known
to carry Derringers.

218
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,987
Hey, old man. You'd better search her,
she might have one in her bustle.

219
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:34,862
I have a good mind
to slap your impertinent face.

220
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,767
You stay away from them.
They kill women.

221
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:43,797
I wish now I'd stayed in Apache Wells
and turned them over to Ben Lattimore.

222
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,145
Much shooting. Much blood.
Many tracks.

223
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:01,022
White men's tracks.
I think Indian boys dead.

224
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,617
If you want,
I find bodies.

225
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:07,791
No. I just wanna plant the old man
and get outta here.

226
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,939
[Horse Blustering]

227
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,382
[Blows]

228
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,684
<i>[Piute]
That good, Dix.</i>

229
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,748
A bottle'd be more
appropriate.

230
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,123
How 'bout givin' me
my gun back, Marshal?

231
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,360
I can be some help
if we're attacked.

232
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,494
You wanna help?
Help her up top.

233
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,267
<i>And you'd better
tie her down.</i>

234
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,241
Hey, Dix! Hurry it up!

235
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:11,719
- Say a prayer, Dix?
- Not for him.

236
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,787
For us.

237
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,226
Keep movin'.

238
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,133
Giddyap!

239
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,977
- Whoa!
- Now what?

240
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,541
Sorry, folks. You're gonna have to
walk for a while.

241
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,281
Otherwise, we'll never
make it up this grade.

242
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,828
Dix say hill too much
for horses. Everybody walk.

243
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,889
Well, that's all right
with us, ain't it, Johnny?

244
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:25,493
When Dix said everybody walk,
he didn't mean you two.

245
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,300
Piute, take
the other side.

246
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,307
Giddyap there!

247
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,707
Hyah!

248
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:43,212
- Shouldn't you be running behind us?
- Marshal say watch them.

249
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:46,746
They cannot run away
chained up like that...

250
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,919
but somebody might
sneak up behind us in the dust.

251
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:53,088
You want to see behind?
Go back there.

252
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:10,409
<i>- [Rumbling]
- Let's get outta here.</i>

253
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,383
[Indistinct]
Come on! Hyah!

254
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,436
<i>[Horse Blusters]</i>

255
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,922
Why don't we stop in Calico
and get some fresh horses?

256
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,893
I wish I could, ma'am,
but nobody lives there anymore.

257
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:01,057
When the gold ran out,
everybody pulled up stakes...

258
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,863
and the only thing alive yonder is rats,
bats, and rattlesnakes.

259
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,336
At this rate, we'll never get
to Moccasin.

260
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:12,172
Well, if we go any faster, ma'am, we'll never
make the next relay station 15 miles away.

261
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,234
Giddyap there!

262
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,346
Dix! Come take look!

263
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:41,129
Piute! Everybody
stay where you are!

264
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,565
Watch the prisoners.

265
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,400
That took a bit
of doin'.

266
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,220
A few sticks of dynamite.

267
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:16,824
You beginnin' to rile me, ma'am.
You get right back up there.

268
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:21,065
- I just wanted to look.
- You can see all there is to see from up there!

269
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:25,337
- Inside.
- And get myself shot?

270
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,674
Hello, Jethro.

271
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:31,838
<i>- Did you wreck the bridge?
- No, it was down when I got here...</i>

272
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,781
<i>a halfhour ago.</i>

273
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:36,115
You see, somebody else
besides myself...

274
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:39,179
is interested in that scum
that you been protecting.

275
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:45,084
Now I can pick both
of those boys off real quick...

276
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,097
but I'd rather
give 'em a chance.

277
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,929
That's more than
they gave my sister.

278
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,595
Now you get 'em outta there
and turn that stagecoach around...

279
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,604
and go back
the way you came.

280
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,539
But leave the keys with me
so I can take off those handcuffs.

281
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:01,237
- Then what?
- Well...

282
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,780
I brought along
a spare one, Jethro.

283
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,214
I thought they might
take turns usin' it.

284
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,846
Well, that isn't exactly
what I'd call "a chance," Ben.

285
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:14,221
- I've seen you in action.
- Have you seen them?

286
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:18,388
They've killed a lot of people, Jethro-
and not always in the back.

287
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:23,765
Lawman's job is to protect his prisoners,
see they get a fair trial.

288
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,770
I don't trust juries.
Now hop to it and get 'em outta there.

289
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,831
Do what he says, Marshal.
I wanna get this stage outta here.

290
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,002
Well, then turn it around.

291
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,983
I've lived a long time without
takin' orders from a gunfighter.

292
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:44,579
I'm too old to start now.

293
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,954
Hold it, Ben.

294
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,489
Sims boys deserve killing.
Take chains off.

295
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:59,001
Whoever wrecked that bridge
didn't do it for fun.

296
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,436
Let 'im have 'em.
I wanna stay in one piece.

297
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,168
Boys take pistol,
we in worse soup.

298
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,370
<i>Ben, I won't let you
murder them!</i>

299
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,879
If I wanted to murder them,
they'd be dead by now.

300
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,644
Are their deaths
more important than our lives?

301
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,778
I'm saving your lives
by taking them off the wagon.

302
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,322
Will you let us
get rollin'?

303
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,655
I've got a tired team here
and I got no place to go but back.

304
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,719
Come on along with us.
We can use your guns.

305
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,265
No, there's no use
talking to him.

306
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:31,790
He's so full of hate,
nothing else matters to him.

307
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,805
Let him go, Marshal.
He wants his blood, let him have it.

308
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:39,832
<i>He's beyond decency,
beyond reason.</i>

309
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,549
All right. The killing can wait.
Turn the wagon around. I'll ride with ya.

310
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,093
Come on, miss.
We got no more time to waste.

311
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,998
Too bad. Gunfighter's way
much better.

312
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:07,663
Maybe shotgun
go off by mistake, huh, Chief?

313
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,070
Both barrels.

314
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,507
Get aboard, you
bloodthirsty savage.

315
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,349
Stop up ahead up there.

316
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,304
Hold up there.

317
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:30,818
You know, nobody's been over
that road to Calico in a dog's age.

318
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:34,585
Why should they be?
Town's been dead for 40 years.

319
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,820
There's still plenty water,
feed and shelter up there.

320
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,192
I say it's a good place
to hole up.

321
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:43,256
I don't think that road back to Apache Wells
is going to be particularly safe tonight...

322
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,461
not with a team
that can barely walk.

323
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,771
What you suddenly
interested in us for, Ben?

324
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,308
I thought all you wanted to do
was to kill my prisoners.

325
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,401
That's still
the only interest I have...

326
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,844
but I still say
let's hole up in Calico.

327
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,944
What do you think, Dix?

328
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,646
Well, if I'm gonna get shot at,
I'd just as soon be inside.

329
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,689
There's nothing
to hide behind up here.

330
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,690
And he's right about the horses.
They're beat.

331
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:12,854
Well, I wish you'd thought of it
instead of Lattimore.

you could trust.

333

Nobody's asking you
to trust me.

334
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,503
I'm here
for only one reason.

335
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,869
Taken me a long time
to catch up with those two...

336
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,874
and I don't intend
to let them get away.

Well, maybe
what you're suggesting...

338
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:32,741
is just what those men who blew up
the bridge want us to do.

339
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,149
Maybe we're walkin'
right into a trap.

340

something here they don't expect- me.

[Chuckles]
Why don't you ask your prisoners?

344
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,595
Turn me loose
and give me a gun...

345
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:57,163
and you'll be looking at the man
who killed Ben Lattimore.

346
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,379
I might just do that,
