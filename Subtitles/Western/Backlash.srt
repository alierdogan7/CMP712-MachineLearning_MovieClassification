1
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:47,292
Did you find what you
were looking for?

2
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:48,509
Not exactly.

3
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,750
Neither has anyone else.

4
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:55,276
A lot of people know the
story of Gila Valley.

5
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:57,771
They all come looking for the gold.

6
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:00,314
I'm not looking for gold.

7
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
What's that?

8
00:03:03,495 --> 00:03:05,961
It's a grave. An old one.

9
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,933
The soldiers dug it when they got
here, but they were a little late.

10
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,243
So they buried what was left.

11
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,326
- And you ...
- Yeah, I dug 'em up.

12
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:18,253
They didn't mind. I think
they were glad I came.

13
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:21,674
Could you use some coffee?

14
00:03:24,476 --> 00:03:27,476
- If it's hot.
- It's hot.

15
00:03:31,082 --> 00:03:32,215
What's your name?

16
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:35,638
 - Karyl.
 - First or last?

17
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,279
Karyl Orton.

18
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,247
Mine's Slater. Jim.

19
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:51,126
- You got a cigarette?
- Nh-nh. I don't smoke.

20
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:54,544
Mine are in my saddlebag.
Do you mind?

21
00:03:56,712 --> 00:03:57,845
No, I don't mind.

22
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:26,241
You wanted some cigarettes, they're
in your saddlebag. Get 'em.

23
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:29,311
Get 'em!

24
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:54,481
You don't lie very good, do you?

25
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:57,774
Who is he?

26
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,265
I don't know.

27
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,266
You set me up for him. Who is he?

28
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:03,084
I don't know.

29
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:13,760
All right. Now, who is he?

30
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:16,439
I told you. I don't know.

31
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:17,508
You don't, eh?

32
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:21,438
I'll tell you something
of which you do know.

33
00:09:21,724 --> 00:09:22,724
What's that?

34
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,687
You're kinda good-looking.

35
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:34,614
- What are you going to do?
- Take him back to Silver City.

36
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:35,709
Why?

37
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,208
Cause that's where he comes from.

38
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,208
It says here.

39
00:09:41,238 --> 00:09:42,538
Get the packhorse, will ya?

40
00:09:58,733 --> 00:09:59,733
Sheriff!

41
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:12,324
- What happened?
- I killed him.

42
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,778
He's one of my deputies.
That mean anything to you?

43
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:18,812
Yeah. You ought to be
a little more choosy.

44
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:22,305
We don't like to have
our deputies murdered.

45
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:24,814
- Killed, not murdered.
- I'll pick my own words.

46
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:28,154
Take care of Tom. Come inside.

47
00:10:38,286 --> 00:10:39,286
Sit down.

48
00:10:42,346 --> 00:10:44,512
Take off your gun and
tell me how it happened.

49
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:50,041
We were at the Gila Valley.
Your man took a shot at us.

50
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:51,926
I said, take off your gun.

51
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:54,284
Don't push it.

52
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:04,619
You move like a man I used to know.

53
00:11:04,802 --> 00:11:06,802
- Do I?
- Wear your gun the same, too.

54
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,101
Seems like a handy way to wear it.

55
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:13,145
- What were you doing at Gila Valley?
- Just passing by.

56
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:16,543
People don't just happen to be passing by
Gila Valley. What were you doing there?

57
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:21,145
Having some coffee and looking for
a package of cigarettes. Mine.

58
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:24,531
They were in the other saddlebag.

59
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,963
You were looking for the
$60,000 in gold ...

60
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,595
that's supposed to be buried
out there, weren't you?

61
00:11:28,808 --> 00:11:30,608
- No.
- Then why were you there?

62
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:33,867
I was looking for a grave.

63
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,150
My father's.

64
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:41,765
Wasn't a nice way to go.

65
00:11:41,975 --> 00:11:45,308
Pinned down for weeks while the Apaches
waited for him to run out of food.

66
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:46,788
Which they did.

67
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:50,071
They didn't have to go that way.
One man was in the clear.

68
00:11:50,124 --> 00:11:50,891
What do you mean?

69
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:53,523
One man got away. Left the
rest to be massacred.

70
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,440
Not according to the records. There
were five men at Gila Valley.

71
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:58,859
- All of 'em are buried there.
- There was a sixth man.

72
00:11:58,891 --> 00:12:02,358
He could've written to the
cavalry post at Tucson for help.

73
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:06,157
But the, uh, gold was more important.

74
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,070
So he let 'em die.

75
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:10,632
- And you're looking for that sixth man?
- That's right.

76
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:18,442
The, uh, deputy you killed is Tom Welker.
Does the name mean anything to you?

77
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:24,372
Yeah. Yeah, there was a Welker buried
with my father at Gila Valley.

78
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,717
Tom's brother. And
he's got two more.

79
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:30,839
- It's a big family?
- Yes. Only it isn't funny.

80
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:32,498
They're good with their guns.

81
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:35,047
When they hear about this, they're
gonna come looking for you.

82
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:36,165
Seems logical.

83
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:39,377
If it's your idea to shoot it out
with them, you're gonna lose.

84
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,399
Could be.

85
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,824
And even if you beat
'em, you're gonna lose.

86
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:45,634
Cause I'm gonna hang
the man that wins.

87
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:49,494
We don't like gunfights in Silver City.

88
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:51,876
I don't want you here when they arrive.

89
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:55,629
Our mail's aboard.
Anything else for Tucson?

90
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:59,404
- Yes, two passengers.
- He's still wearing his gun.

91
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:02,010
You wanna take it away from him?

92
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,567
It's a hard ride into Tucson, but
you'll both like it better there.

93
00:13:13,057 --> 00:13:15,457
Well, I like it here in Silver City.

94
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,730
- Your luggage in your hotel?
- Yes.

95
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:24,408
Get on the stage, we'll
send it to you later.

96
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:28,766
Uh, oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

97
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:33,652
I'll, uh, give you $50 for your
horse, if you're leaving without him.

98
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:37,761
- My horse?
- Welker killed yours. You own his.

99
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,647
- You keep him. A gift.
- Get her aboard, Harry.

100
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,128
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

101
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,807
I don't want anybody telling
the Welkers about this.

102
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:02,951
You're a little late. Joe
Harris just rode out.

103
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:12,871
I still don't want any gunfights in
Silver City. Why don't you go away?

104
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:15,988
I can't.

105
00:14:16,984 --> 00:14:21,251
- What do you got in mind?
- Well, I came here for information.

106
00:14:22,547 --> 00:14:24,814
- And if you got it?
- I'd leave.

107
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:30,289
Ride into Tucson and have
a talk with George Lake.

108
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:34,242
He's the sergeant in charge of the detail
that found the bodies and buried 'em.

109
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:37,238
Could be he'll have
something to tell you.

110
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:38,324
All right.

111
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:41,790
If you hadn't been so stubborn, you'd be
riding into Tucson easy on that stage.

112
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:44,094
Yeah, but then I wouldn't have
known about Sergeant Lake.

113
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:46,710
- Oh, my name's Jim  ...
- I don't wanna know your name.

114
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:51,069
I just want you to go away. That's
why I told you about Sergeant Lake.

115
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:55,617
While I was riding, I'd
look back once in a while.

116
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,267
Jeff and Tony Welker
aren't nice people.

117
00:14:58,875 --> 00:14:59,875
Thanks.

118
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:25,291
- The orderly room in here, corporal?
- Yes, sir.

119
00:15:25,314 --> 00:15:26,314
Thanks.

120
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:35,148
Hello, Colonel. My name is Slater.

121
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:39,785
I'd like permission to speak with Sergeant
George Lake about a personal matter.

122
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:43,225
Strange. That's the second request
this morning I've had about Lake.

123
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,863
The first wasn't phrased
quite so formally.

124
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:48,649
Well, I'm sure it wasn't
turned down for that reason.

125
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:52,556
No, I told Miss Orton she could find
Sergeant Lake at Benton's trading post.

126
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:55,527
He's in charge of the detail I sent
at the request of the Indian agent.

127
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,922
- Hm. Trouble with the Apaches?
- Yes.

128
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:01,796
You, uh, tell her about this?

129
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,057
I advised her to stay well clear
of Benton's trading post.

130
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,750
I advise you to do the same.

131
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,343
60,000 in gold won't do you any good if your
scalp is hanging from an Apache's belt.

132
00:16:12,383 --> 00:16:15,450
- I'm not after the gold, Colonel.
- You are.

133
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,608
Mr. Slater, you're a civilian.
I can't prevent you from going.

134
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,570
If Sergeant Lake wishes
to see you, he may.

135
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:24,114
Thank you, sir.

136
00:16:56,219 --> 00:17:00,952
- If this is a hold-up, you're dead.
- If I did it this way, I'd deserve to be.

137
00:17:00,996 --> 00:17:04,296
- What'd you stop us for?
- The Apaches are talking.

138
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:06,093
Thought you might wanna listen.

139
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:09,348
The man's right. That's
an Apache signal.

140
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:12,808
That man's half right. Can't
no-one listen to smoke, though.

141
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:13,866
Can't they?

142
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,407
- That could be the trading post.
- It is.

143
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:22,876
- How do you know?
- Cause I rode up and I had a look.

144
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:24,935
Then I rode right back again.

145
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,299
- We ain't even looking.
- I would if I were you.

146
00:17:36,642 --> 00:17:39,409
- They got us in the middle.
- Yeah, and this ain't no place to fight.

147
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:43,130
Well, there's a cavalry detachment at the
trading post. Why not make a run for it?

148
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:47,027
- Why didn't you make a run for it?
- I was kinda lonesome.

149
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:48,383
Giddy up!

150
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:33,121
Don't waste 'em on me,
save 'em for the Apaches!

151
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:35,765
Well, then get out of the way!

152
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:57,272
Hey, grab this!

153
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,980
Catch the leaders! Catch the
leaders as they come in!

154
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:28,813
Get inside!

155
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,373
Swing her around to the back!

156
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:54,432
Tie up the rigging and get inside!
Keep these horses under cover!

157
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:58,102
Don't we have enough trouble
without you bringing us more?

158
00:19:58,444 --> 00:20:02,711
Oh, I wouldn't call her trouble.
But then again, maybe I should.

159
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,640
- Trouble or not, she's your guest.
- My guest? What do you want with me?

160
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:12,160
- I can wait, Sergeant.
- You sure can.

161
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:35,994
- They're coming.
- Gimme a gun!

162
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,447
Well, you lost us our horses, but I got
to admit you do real good with that rifle.

163
00:20:57,621 --> 00:21:00,888
- Well, you're not exactly bad.
- It's my trade.

164
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:05,102
And there's days when I wished I
didn't work at it. This is one of 'em.

165
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:06,544
I don't blame you.

166
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:09,322
- You're Sergeant Lake, aren't you?
- That's me.

167
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:13,501
Well, uh, there's another bad
day I'd like to find out about.

168
00:21:14,112 --> 00:21:15,612
It happened at Gila Valley.

169
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:21,781
- What do you know about Gila Valley?
- My father's buried there.

170
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,917
- What's your name?
- Jim Slater.

171
00:21:29,762 --> 00:21:32,329
- Wait a minute, Sergeant. I came ...
- I wasn't there during the shooting.

172
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,224
I was just sent in to
bury what was left.

173
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,923
And I hope somebody'll be around
to bury us in the morning.

174
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:43,698
Why do you say that? We've got guns, food,
cartridges. We can hold 'em off for a week.

175
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:47,379
By then, even that stupid crowd at the
fort will know something's wrong.

176
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:52,862
Mr. Benton, it's a shame those guns you sell
the Apaches don't shoot a little straighter.

177
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:55,159
Can I have a little coffee, miss?

178
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,782
They'll send riders back
in the hills tonight.

179
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:01,119
Tomorrow morning we can expect a
few hundred of 'em out there.

180
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:04,972
An hour later they'll be
coming through the door.

181
00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:07,247
You got any ideas?

182
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,059
I say, let's get outta here. We've
got the stage, let's use it.

183
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:13,965
All of us on one stage? They'd
run us down in no time.

184
00:22:14,076 --> 00:22:18,743
- Some of us could get through.
- Yeah, some. And you'd be one of 'em.

185
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:22,374
On the other hand, we
could try to make a deal.

186
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:27,883
They ain't really mad at but one of us. And
if we give 'em that one man, they might ...

187
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:36,836
- You wouldn't do that.
- Then keep your mouth shut.

188
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,124
I'll think of something when it gets dark.

189
00:22:41,246 --> 00:22:43,079
Where can I find some
more coffee, Sergeant?

190
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:45,834
- Oh, help yourself, there's plenty of it.
- I'll get some.

191
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,293
That ain't government issue, Sergeant. Anything
that's drunk or ate has to be paid for.

192
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:59,445
Mister, you got a deal. You
collect from the Apaches.

193
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,406
I'll get you some fresh water, miss.

194
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:27,895
Sergeant? I've read your report on
Gila Valley. That's why I'm here.

195
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,798
I'd, uh, like to find out more.

196
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:34,245
There isn't any more. There were
five men out there, and I buried 'em.

197
00:23:34,388 --> 00:23:37,455
Three of 'em I can identify
from letters and papers.

198
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:41,203
There was Turnbloom, Gibson and Welker.

199
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:44,025
I knew Welker. He was no good.

200
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:47,380
Are you sure you can't
identify the other two?

201
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:50,842
No. There was no way of telling.

202
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,666
What about the sixth man?

203
00:23:57,123 --> 00:23:58,723
Why don't you leave it alone, son?

204
00:23:58,822 --> 00:24:01,822
I'd like to, but first I've
got a few questions to ask.

205
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:06,149
They had a few at Gila Valley.
The Apaches answered 'em.

206
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:09,073
They might do the same here.

207
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:15,073
Need some help?

208
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:20,317
To make the coffee or look
for the gold in Gila Valley?

209
00:24:20,406 --> 00:24:23,573
Look, I've told you once. I'm
not interested in that gold.

210
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:26,852
I am. Part of it belongs to me.

211
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:28,748
How do you figure?

212
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,194
One of the men who died
there was my husband.

213
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:36,272
I thought so.

214
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:53,544
You got any ideas?

215
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:59,469
Yeah. But I'll listen
to yours first.

216
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:04,095
It's my guess they got most of the
horses bunched out there in the rocks.

217
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,007
Two men could step out, find the horses,
stampede 'em, put the Apaches afoot.

218
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:13,499
Uh-huh. Then they could load up the
stage and make a break for it, eh?

219
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:17,978
- Yeah. Sound good to you?
- Well, I can't think of anything better.

220
00:25:18,556 --> 00:25:21,223
Well, I need to find a good
man to go out there with me.

221
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:25,953
Vogel's too clumsy, Marcus
is new to this country.

222
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,783
Why don't you settle for me?

223
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:32,135
- You looking for a medal?
- Nope. I got one.

224
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:35,310
I bet you would've traded it for
a meal after the surrender.

225
00:25:36,022 --> 00:25:36,922
How'd you guess?

226
00:25:36,998 --> 00:25:40,765
Oh, I fought against you rebels.
All guts and no sense.

227
00:25:41,864 --> 00:25:44,197
Hey, Sarge. Can we
light a lantern?

228
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,380
Why not? They know you're here.

229
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:54,248
We're taking a little walk.

230
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:57,961
To see if we can stampede the Indians'
horses and give you a chance to break out.

231
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,367
Miliken, have the stage loaded and
ready to go as soon as we get back.

232
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:06,473
- Well, what if you don't get back?
- Now, that's a pleasant thought.

233
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:19,794
You're going with Lake.

234
00:26:20,094 --> 00:26:24,594
Mh-hm. Too bad you can't
tell the Apaches.

235
00:26:25,522 --> 00:26:28,222
They might have better luck
than your friend, Welker.

236
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:40,734
You know, uh, ever since I first saw you,
there's been something I've wanted to do.

237
00:26:42,244 --> 00:26:43,244
What's that?

238
00:26:43,611 --> 00:26:44,611
Say goodbye.

239
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:52,659
Well, good-bye.

240
00:27:01,715 --> 00:27:02,715
Well?

241
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:06,205
Of course, I got no idea how to
get to the horses. Have you?

242
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:07,609
Only one.

243
00:27:08,162 --> 00:27:10,295
- Just keep moving.
- Let's go.

244
00:28:00,955 --> 00:28:02,355
Well, there they are.

245
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:07,914
There must be a guard
or whatever he is.

246
00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:19,754
- That's a good trick.
- I learned it from a rebel.

247
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:22,383
Keep him happy.

248
00:29:52,021 --> 00:29:56,154
- That was another good trick.
- I learned it from a yank.

249
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,683
On top for you, Benton.
Get up there.

250
00:31:26,216 --> 00:31:29,083
- Time to go, son.
- Come on, let's get outta here!

251
00:32:25,185 --> 00:32:31,385
Keep going. I'll hold up here for while.
You can make Tucson easy.

252
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:38,306
Go on, get outta here. I only got
a few minutes, and you know it.

253
00:32:57,968 --> 00:33:01,635
- Are you fixing to die noble?
- Not exactly.

254
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:05,353
- Then get out while you got time.
- I got time. Here.

255
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:14,661
I figured you for a good soldier.
I should've known better.

256
00:33:15,636 --> 00:33:20,236
- Good soldiers never volunteer.
- Maybe I wanted to keep you alive.

257
00:33:20,572 --> 00:33:22,672
Huh. You've done a rotten job.

258
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:29,072
Look, uh, Sergeant, I don't
like to push this, but ...

259
00:33:29,397 --> 00:33:31,964
Yeah, I know. What
do you wanna know?

260
00:33:32,805 --> 00:33:37,105
- You buried five men at Gila Valley, right?
- What was left of 'em.

261
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:40,151
And you could identify three:
Turnbloom, Gibson and Welker, yeah?

262
00:33:40,224 --> 00:33:41,024
Yeah.

263
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:43,465
All right. Now, what about
the other two you buried?

264
00:33:43,504 --> 00:33:46,037
Well, there wasn't much
left to go on by, just ...

265
00:33:46,336 --> 00:33:51,469
One of 'em had a hand missing. Left hand.
Even before the Apaches got to him.

266
00:33:52,802 --> 00:33:57,469
I don't know who he was. And the
other one, there's no way of telling.

267
00:33:57,531 --> 00:34:00,764
- What about the man who ran out?
- Leave it alone, son.

268
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,788
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

269
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:05,635
- Sergeant, I got to know. Who was he?
- Don't go into it, son.

270
00:34:05,678 --> 00:34:07,478
Who was he? Where
can I find him?

271
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,988
We found a horse, 
wearing a Texas brand.

272
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:16,294
Diamond C. Carson's outfit.

273
00:34:16,864 --> 00:34:18,797
Just beyond Sierra Blanca.

274
00:34:21,178 --> 00:34:22,511
Leave it alone, son.

275
00:34:34,413 --> 00:34:36,080
Well, that's your fault, not mine.

276
00:34:36,153 --> 00:34:38,553
I told you the Apaches had
guns, and they wanted more.

277
00:34:38,651 --> 00:34:40,784
But this time they decided
not to pay for them.

278
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,429
All right, make out your claim and sign it.
I'll put it through regular channels.

279
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:45,131
- Sergeant, give him the forms.
- Yes, sir.

280
00:34:45,186 --> 00:34:47,786
Colonel? Two men to see you.
Jeff and Tony Welker.

281
00:34:48,057 --> 00:34:50,957
- Yes?
- We're looking for a man named Jim Slater.

282
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:53,483
We heard in Silver City we
might find him here in Tucson.

283
00:34:53,504 --> 00:34:56,304
- I'm afraid you're a little late.
- What for are we late?

284
00:34:56,338 --> 00:34:59,405
- He's dead.
- Who killed him?

285
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:02,675
The Apaches. Benton was there,
he can give you the details.

286
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:10,574
- Did you see Slater die?
- Don't bother me.

287
00:35:12,173 --> 00:35:14,440
Did you see Slater die?

288
00:35:17,107 --> 00:35:18,774
I ... Yes, I saw him die.

289
00:35:19,557 --> 00:35:20,824
Did he die slow?

290
00:35:23,273 --> 00:35:24,273
Yes.

291
00:35:54,937 --> 00:35:57,137
- My key, please.
- That's fine.

292
00:35:59,062 --> 00:36:01,029
May I say that you're looking
mighty elegant, ma'am?

293
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:03,639
- You may. And thank you.
- Hello, Miss Orton. Uh ...

294
00:36:04,587 --> 00:36:06,354
Any news come through
on Slater and Lake?

295
00:36:06,886 --> 00:36:11,153
No, nothing. I've asked Colonel Welnick
to let me know if he hears anything.

296
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:13,486
Might as well forget 'em.
They're dead.

297
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:16,261
- Miss Orton?
- Yes?

298
00:36:18,772 --> 00:36:20,339
I'm gonna buy you a drink.

299
00:36:21,196 --> 00:36:23,729
- Thank you. I don't drink.
- Well, I'm still gonna buy you a drink.

300
00:36:23,854 --> 00:36:26,154
Sir, you don't know this lady.
You got no right to ...

301
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:36,269
What for are you looking at me?

302
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,450
Put him back in his chair.

303
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,050
Drink up. Over there.

304
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:56,383
Drink for me. Two drinks for them.

305
00:36:56,775 --> 00:36:58,108
How long do you know Jim Slater?

306
00:36:59,398 --> 00:37:03,365
We met yesterday at the trading post.
I was on the stagecoach.

307
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:05,149
- Going where?
- El Paso.

308
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,570
- From where?
- Here. Tucson.

309
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:10,378
- She's a pretty woman.
- Yeah, Tom liked pretty women.

310
00:37:10,517 --> 00:37:13,117
- Were you in Silver City?
- Were you?

311
00:37:13,513 --> 00:37:16,313
She was in Silver City. She's
the one Tom wrote about.

312
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,927
- Ain't you the one Tom wrote about?
- No.

313
00:37:19,293 --> 00:37:24,293
Maybe he told her more than he told us.
Maybe he told her where's the gold.

314
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,930
- Bottle. Scared?
- No.

315
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,660
Tom learned things in Gila Valley. Claimed
he was this close to something real good.

316
00:37:35,091 --> 00:37:36,391
Of course, he could've meant you.

317
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:38,301
Or he could've meant the gold.

318
00:37:38,568 --> 00:37:41,801
Oh, that's fine, doll. You're
gonna talk and I'm gonna listen.

319
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,728
- Clerk?
- Something you want, ma'am?

320
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:47,314
Yeah, jug of water.

321
00:38:02,164 --> 00:38:06,464
Well, well, well.
You do get around.

322
00:38:06,528 --> 00:38:09,595
- Does it bother you?
- No, no. No, not at all.

323
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:12,494
Have a nice time, Miss Orton.

324
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:16,092
- Thank you, Mr. Slater.
- Slater?

325
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:31,443
Who was this?

326
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:33,907
Jeff Welker.

327
00:38:42,976 --> 00:38:44,643
And you set me up for him.

328
00:39:37,581 --> 00:39:40,414
- I guess I didn't hit you hard enough.
- Yes, you did.

329
00:39:40,418 --> 00:39:42,685
- What do you want?
- To see you.

330
00:39:43,957 --> 00:39:47,124
I didn't think you could tear
yourself away from your friends.

331
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:48,223
It was easy.

332
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:52,334
You know, if I was smart,
I'd run you outta here.

333
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:54,873
- Why don't you?
- I'm not smart.

334
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,494
And you're good-looking.

335
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,773
Oh, don't tell me that makes
any difference to you.

336
00:40:02,006 --> 00:40:03,139
At times it does.

337
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:13,938
With a shoulder like this,
tonight's not one of those times.

338
00:40:13,981 --> 00:40:14,981
Why not?

339
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:21,997
- Help yourself.
- It's a beautiful thought.

340
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:26,245
At least you could do a
better job than the Welkers.

341
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:29,311
Yours wasn't such a good job.
Tony Welker's still alive.

342
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:31,997
Soon as he's able, he'll
come looking for you.

343
00:40:32,024 --> 00:40:34,157
And you'll be here to
set me up for him, huh?

344
00:40:35,315 --> 00:40:36,648
Does that amuse you?

345
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,559
I don't mind playing games as
long as it's winner take all.

346
00:40:41,568 --> 00:40:42,568
Bite on this.

347
00:40:43,821 --> 00:40:44,821
Thank you.

348
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:53,747
- You'll need it.
- Have a nice time.

349
00:40:53,836 --> 00:40:54,836
Thank you.

350
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:01,489
Next time you get any
ideas about me and men ...

351
00:41:02,342 --> 00:41:03,342
or you ...

352
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:09,316
I won't set you up for anyone.
I'll kill you myself.

353
00:41:28,006 --> 00:41:31,272
You know, you're ... you're
right about tonight.

354
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:53,565
Try this. Might help.

355
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:03,082
- Arsenic?
- Could be.

356
00:42:09,795 --> 00:42:11,462
What'd you come here for?

357
00:42:14,222 --> 00:42:20,122
To make a deal. I want that gold, but
you've learned things that I don't know.

358
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,439
- And you'd like to know?
- Naturally.

359
00:42:23,388 --> 00:42:29,021
Well, uh, what have you
got to offer in return?

360
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,703
What do you want?

361
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:42,104
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

362
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:47,089
- Are you all right?
- Yup.

363
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,307
- Are you tired?
- Nope.

364
00:42:52,474 --> 00:42:54,074
- Sleepy?
- Nope.

365
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,157
It's a lazy woman who won't
spread her own blankets.

366
00:43:05,636 --> 00:43:06,636
Thanks.

367
00:43:08,193 --> 00:43:10,360
Hey, what was that thing you gave me?

368
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:15,147
Just an old Southern painkiller.
One we used back in Atlanta.

369
00:43:15,499 --> 00:43:17,166
- Atlanta, huh?
- Mh-hm.

370
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,428
I was born there.

371
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:22,133
Married there, too.

372
00:43:31,649 --> 00:43:34,282
- Tell me about your husband.
- What?

373
00:43:34,722 --> 00:43:36,589
- Was he in the war?
- Yes.

374
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:41,481
- Did he lose a hand? The left one?
- I don't know.

375
00:43:42,073 --> 00:43:45,106
- Paul didn't come home after the surrender.
- Why not?

376
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:49,582
Unless you lived in the South,
I don't think you'd understand.

377
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:53,044
I lived in Texas. I still don't understand.
Why didn't he come home?

378
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:56,169
Well, Paul was proud.

379
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:01,295
Some friends told him
about me and, uh ...

380
00:44:02,776 --> 00:44:07,643
- ... the things I was doing to keep alive.
- Consorting with the enemy.

381
00:44:08,876 --> 00:44:12,709
- I'm trying to be nice. Why don't you?
- It's impossible.

382
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:16,853
So he went to Arizona and
he found himself some gold.

383
00:44:17,713 --> 00:44:21,180
Being a gentleman, he wrote to you and
offered you to share his wealth with him.

384
00:44:21,209 --> 00:44:23,942
- That was a very nice gesture.
- You can try harder than that.

385
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,670
I don't like gentlemen.
Not that kind.

386
00:44:28,938 --> 00:44:32,104
The kind who won't forgive a
woman when she's made a mistake?

387
00:44:32,831 --> 00:44:33,964
Was it a mistake?

388
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:50,924
You know, it's a funny thing.

389
00:44:52,045 --> 00:44:55,045
That shoulder isn't
nearly as bad as it was.

390
00:45:01,263 --> 00:45:02,863
Not nearly as bad.

391
00:45:14,475 --> 00:45:16,975
Old Southern painkiller ...

392
00:45:17,942 --> 00:45:22,409
- Lady, you do pick your spots.
- And my men.

393
00:45:30,334 --> 00:45:33,201
Why did you ask me if
Paul had lost a hand?

394
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,493
One of the men buried at Gila
Valley was short a left hand.

395
00:45:38,782 --> 00:45:42,582
- Did Lake tell you this?
- Uh-huh. Just before he died.

396
00:45:43,196 --> 00:45:47,196
- What else did he tell you?
- Nothing much. Just what he told you.

397
00:45:48,516 --> 00:45:52,149
He could ... he could
identify three men.

398
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:57,847
That leaves an unidentified
body and a man with one hand.

399
00:45:59,479 --> 00:46:03,112
- And a sixth man.
- Did he tell you his name?

400
00:46:03,225 --> 00:46:04,258
Nh-nh.

401
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:12,750
No, but there was a
Texas-brand horse there.

402
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,630
It was one of Carson's.

403
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:19,675
His place is just beyond Sierra Blanca.

404
00:46:20,982 --> 00:46:22,915
And that's where we're going?

405
00:46:25,844 --> 00:46:28,044
- We?
- We.

406
00:46:37,181 --> 00:46:40,681
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

407
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,847
- There.
- Thanks.

408
00:48:14,408 --> 00:48:17,041
- How's the shoulder?
- Uh, pretty good.

409
00:48:24,149 --> 00:48:25,216
What's that for?

410
00:48:25,743 --> 00:48:29,943
It's new. And a gun's no good
unless it fits well in your hand.

411
00:48:31,032 --> 00:48:33,999
- Where did you learn so much about guns?
- Just picked it up.

412
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,417
- From your father?
- Nope.

413
00:48:38,057 --> 00:48:41,224
I never knew my father. He went
away when I was a little kid.

414
00:48:41,882 --> 00:48:44,282
- Don't you remember him at all?
- Nh-nh.

415
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:48,386
You know, it's a funny
thing about your father.

416
00:48:49,557 --> 00:48:51,457
You begin to wonder about him.

417
00:48:52,426 --> 00:48:55,159
What he was like. What he was doing.

418
00:48:55,659 --> 00:48:58,959
- I can understand that. Drink?
- Oh, thanks.

419
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,514
You know, this is nice
country, isn't it?

420
00:49:07,162 --> 00:49:08,895
Mighty, mighty nice.

421
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:15,073
I sure like it here.
I'm glad I came out.

422
00:49:15,177 --> 00:49:16,510
- You are?
- Mh-hm.

423
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,540
There's a a strip of
land near Gila Valley.

424
00:49:21,365 --> 00:49:24,965
It's got good grass,
and there's water.

425
00:49:26,013 --> 00:49:28,580
A man could put in some
cattle and raise beef.

426
00:49:29,614 --> 00:49:33,381
If he could use a hammer and
saw, he could build a house.

427
00:49:36,303 --> 00:49:39,970
Trouble is, I'm not much
good with a hammer and saw.

428
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:41,544
You could learn.

429
00:49:41,943 --> 00:49:45,243
Yeah. I will someday.

430
00:49:45,323 --> 00:49:47,523
- But you won't.
- Why not?

431
00:49:47,726 --> 00:49:50,759
You've learned to hunt.
That's much more exciting.

432
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:53,848
- Think so?
- Yes. When you're hunting a man.

433
00:49:56,301 --> 00:49:58,401
Why don't you stop
looking for trouble?

434
00:49:59,135 --> 00:50:00,535
Go on, build your house.

435
00:50:01,074 --> 00:50:03,407
While you're at it, you
might find some happiness.

436
00:50:04,621 --> 00:50:08,354
I didn't look for this, Karyl, but
my father was killed at Gila Valley.

437
00:50:09,149 --> 00:50:11,182
And I'm gonna find the
man who murdered him.

438
00:50:31,926 --> 00:50:33,659
We must be getting close
to Carson's ground.

439
00:50:34,163 --> 00:50:36,630
- We're on it now.
- How can you tell?

440
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:38,188
I asked the steer.

441
00:50:43,943 --> 00:50:45,210
Stay where you are!

442
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,376
Oh no, not again.

443
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:52,036
You know, a man can get awful tired
of being shot at. Now, who are they?

444
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:54,251
This one's on you.

445
00:51:01,984 --> 00:51:05,384
This is as far as you go, mister.
You're on Major Carson's ground.

446
00:51:05,512 --> 00:51:07,512
- I know that.
- Who told ya?

447
00:51:07,906 --> 00:51:09,173
He asked the steer.

448
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:13,593
Oh. You're a funny girl.
I like funny girls.

449
00:51:14,496 --> 00:51:15,629
I don't like you.

450
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:18,776
Why don't you teach
this brat some manners?

451
00:51:20,198 --> 00:51:21,498
Keep your hand off
that gun, Johnny.

452
00:51:21,665 --> 00:51:25,665
Well, I don't like nobody to stop my draw.
I don't like nobody to tell me what to do.

453
00:51:25,761 --> 00:51:28,994
As long as you work for the Diamond
C, you'll do what I tell you to do.

454
00:51:37,662 --> 00:51:41,195
You can go now. You too, ma'am.
That way.

455
00:51:41,344 --> 00:51:43,944
If you don't mind, I'd
like to see Major Carson.

456
00:51:44,432 --> 00:51:46,165
- You would, huh?
- Yeah.

457
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:51,339
Well, all right. You can see the Major.
Ride on ahead.

458
00:51:51,552 --> 00:51:55,019
And have, uh, Jumpy here
put a bullet in my back?

459
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,477
Ride up beside him, Johnny.
You're riding with me, ma'am.

460
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,797
He said, beside me.

461
00:52:12,955 --> 00:52:14,022
All right, miss.

462
00:52:17,962 --> 00:52:21,762
I noticed you use a tie-down.
Does that mean you're fast?

463
00:52:22,885 --> 00:52:26,418
Everybody west of the Pecos
they think they're fast.

464
00:52:27,567 --> 00:52:31,034
What I said back there still goes.
I don't like ya.

465
00:52:31,344 --> 00:52:33,144
That makes me very unhappy.

466
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:36,677
I like your woman. Does
that make you unhappy?

467
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:39,621
- How far is the ranch?
- Why?

468
00:52:39,847 --> 00:52:42,247
You keep that up, one of
us might not get there.

469
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:44,958
Reach for your gun.
You might be right.

470
00:53:10,498 --> 00:53:13,331
Maybe you better take off your gun-belt,
mister. Just hang it on the saddle.

471
00:53:14,928 --> 00:53:18,028
- Thanks. I'll wear it.
- You heard what the man said.

472
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:21,816
- You take off your belt, or I'll knock ...
- That'll be enough, Johnny.

473
00:53:22,873 --> 00:53:25,140
This is neither the time nor
the place for fighting.

474
00:53:25,363 --> 00:53:27,530
You'll have more than enough
on your hands in the morning.

475
00:53:27,726 --> 00:53:29,526
How's that? In the morning?

476
00:53:31,697 --> 00:53:32,797
I can wait.

477
00:53:33,413 --> 00:53:37,013
- I'm Major Carson.
- Oh, how are you, sir? I'm Jim Slater.

478
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:39,142
And this is Miss Orton.

479
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,076
- Miss Orton.
- How do you do?

480
00:53:42,191 --> 00:53:43,658
- May I?
- Thank you.

481
00:53:44,424 --> 00:53:46,424
Tom, will you take Miss
Orton into the house?

482
00:53:46,452 --> 00:53:49,052
- Certainly.
- Pedro, you take care of the horses.

483
00:53:51,644 --> 00:53:54,411
I hope you're looking for work,
Mr. Slater. I can use a good man.

484
00:53:56,202 --> 00:54:00,935
Well, I don't know. Looks like you
got one or two on hand right now.

485
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:05,306
- I'll take all I can find.
- Any particular reason?

486
00:54:05,414 --> 00:54:08,614
A very good reason.
A thing called survival.

487
00:54:15,951 --> 00:54:18,451
- Nice place.
- Thank you.

488
00:54:18,682 --> 00:54:21,715
- Is this a picture of your son, Major?
- My nephew.

489
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,267
That was taken when he was released
from the hospital in Richmond.

490
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:29,330
- Oh, uh, drink?
- Yes, please.

491
00:54:30,626 --> 00:54:32,859
I had hoped he would join me in Texas.

492
00:54:33,631 --> 00:54:36,464
But he was young and there
was gold in Arizona.

493
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:40,309
- I needed him very badly.
- Thanks.

494
00:54:41,763 --> 00:54:44,830
I, uh, I could still use
a good man, Mr. Slater.

495
00:54:45,827 --> 00:54:49,194
- Would high wages be an inducement?
- No, I'm afraid not.

496
00:54:49,506 --> 00:54:54,006
That's too bad. You might face up
very well against Jim Bonniwell.

497
00:54:55,222 --> 00:54:58,089
- Why do you say that?
- Well, you're a gunfighter, aren't you?

498
00:54:59,073 --> 00:55:02,340
Oh, that's not an uncomplimentary
term in this country.

499
00:55:04,052 --> 00:55:06,419
I'm not interested in
Mr. Bonniwell, Major.

500
00:55:06,676 --> 00:55:08,676
You will be if you stay in Texas.

501
00:55:09,577 --> 00:55:12,610
You see, for years, these hills
have been a haven for outlaws.

502
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:15,837
We haven't liked it, but we haven't
been particularly concerned.

503
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,053
Oh, you lose a steer now and then, but all
in all, they've left the big ranches alone.

504
00:55:21,353 --> 00:55:23,153
Then Jim Bonniwell arrived.

505
00:55:24,311 --> 00:55:27,244
- And became their leader?
- Their employer.

506
00:55:28,582 --> 00:55:31,315
Mr. Bonniwell is a very
respectable rancher.

507
00:55:32,091 --> 00:55:34,491
He arrived in Texas
with about $60,000.

508
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:37,639
All of which he invested
in land and equipment.

509
00:55:38,584 --> 00:55:40,951
But Mr. Bonniwell neglected
to buy any cattle.

510
00:55:41,837 --> 00:55:46,037
Today, there are 5,000
head that carry his brand.

511
00:55:46,997 --> 00:55:50,297
- When did he first come here?
- Not long after the surrender.

512
00:55:50,896 --> 00:55:53,963
In fact, it was Mr. Bonniwell who
brought me the news of my nephew.

513
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,867
He happened to be in Silver City at the
time the Apaches went on the warpath.

514
00:56:01,514 --> 00:56:06,147
He met Norman, and the boy told him about
a strike they'd made in some place called ...

515
00:56:06,476 --> 00:56:09,076
- Gila Valley?
- Yes. Yes, that's it.

516
00:56:09,842 --> 00:56:11,909
Otherwise, I might not have known.

517
00:56:12,124 --> 00:56:14,624
Major Carson? The
sheriff just came in.

518
00:56:15,187 --> 00:56:16,687
Has he agreed to ride with us?

519
00:56:17,428 --> 00:56:19,161
Maybe you better talk to him alone.

520
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:22,309
- If you'll excuse me ...
- Of course.

521
00:56:33,985 --> 00:56:38,518
Turnbloom, Welker, Gibson.
And now Carson.

522
00:56:40,954 --> 00:56:44,487
Five men in one grave,
and we've identified four.

523
00:56:44,813 --> 00:56:46,613
- Now we know.
- What?

524
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,136
- The sixth man.
- Bonniwell.

525
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:53,990
- That's the name he wears now.
- The name he used to wear?

526
00:56:56,292 --> 00:56:57,359
You should know.

527
00:56:57,967 --> 00:57:01,367
Jim, let's go away. Let's forget Bonniwell.
Please take me with you.

528
00:57:01,476 --> 00:57:04,576
- I'll be good to you. I'll never do ...
- This is kind of a quick change, isn't it?

529
00:57:04,585 --> 00:57:06,885
- What about your gold?
- I don't want it.

530
00:57:07,339 --> 00:57:10,706
All of this to keep me from
killing a man who ran out on you.

531
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:13,917
A woman loved me that much,
I'd never leave her.

532
00:57:14,466 --> 00:57:18,866
When I find your husband, among other
things, I'll tell him he's a fool.

533
00:57:18,928 --> 00:57:22,028
- My husband?
- The man who calls himself Jim Bonniwell.

534
00:57:22,213 --> 00:57:23,013
Jim!

535
00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:28,722
Have you ever stopped to think
Bonniwell might be your father?

536
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:36,728
- Don't ... Do-, do-, don't say that.
- Why not?

537
00:57:38,302 --> 00:57:40,769
You've been thinking it
ever since you read this.

538
00:57:41,569 --> 00:57:42,836
It's a nice letter.

539
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,826
From another man who
ran out on his wife.

540
00:57:46,283 --> 00:57:48,450
From another man who
struck it rich.

541
00:57:49,551 --> 00:57:51,451
You still say you're not
interested in the gold.

542
00:57:51,487 --> 00:57:52,487
I'm not!

543
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:56,519
Then all of this is just to find a
murderer and get him under your gun?

544
00:57:56,565 --> 00:58:00,665
- Look, look, Karyl, I, I, I've got to go.
- Jim, this could be your father.

545
00:58:01,627 --> 00:58:04,194
If it is, will you kill him?

546
00:58:06,436 --> 00:58:08,436
- Jim, please!
- Karyl, it won't work.

547
00:58:08,915 --> 00:58:13,782
There are things a man has to know and has
to do, and it's best if he does 'em alone.

548
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:19,575
All the boys would feel better if they were
riding as deputies under you and Dobbs.

549
00:58:20,981 --> 00:58:21,981
Oh, Mr. Slater!

550
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,540
Who is he?

551
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:33,408
A gentleman who decided
no to sell me his gun.

552
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:37,339
- Am I right, Miss Orton?
- I'm afraid you are.

553
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,307
Well, one man more or less
won't make much difference.

554
00:58:41,002 --> 00:58:43,669
Unless it happens to be you, Sheriff,
we'd still like to have you with us.

555
00:58:44,122 --> 00:58:46,622
Officially, I can't take
part in a range war.

556
00:58:46,802 --> 00:58:49,735
If Bonniwell's a thief, and I'm sure he is,
the rangers will have to take care of him.

557
00:58:49,909 --> 00:58:51,276
We're not gonna wait that long.

558
00:58:51,938 --> 00:58:53,438
Suppose you sleep on it, Sheriff.

559
00:58:54,236 --> 00:58:56,836
In the morning, we'll ride through
town on the way to Bonniwell's ranch.

560
00:58:57,234 --> 00:58:59,867
- That's the present plan, isn't it?
- That's what I told all the men.

561
00:58:59,978 --> 00:59:03,078
We'll stop by your office.
You've changed your mind, well ...

562
00:59:03,516 --> 00:59:06,216
In the meanwhile, how about buying
you and Dobbs a drink for the road?

563
00:59:06,865 --> 00:59:08,698
Thanks, I'll take my drink at
the other end of the road.

564
00:59:08,768 --> 00:59:10,868
I'll need it when I get there.
C'mon, Dobbs.

565
00:59:34,264 --> 00:59:35,931
Carson's gonna make his
move in the morning, Jim.

566
00:59:35,997 --> 00:59:39,197
They'll ride into town, pick up the sheriff
and hit you with everything they got.

567
00:59:39,474 --> 00:59:43,341
- What's my name?
- He's gonna make his move, Mr. Bonniwell.

568
00:59:44,192 --> 00:59:46,759
- Picking up the sheriff here, huh?
- That's right.

569
00:59:46,891 --> 00:59:50,758
- I rode all the way in just to tell ya.
- Very well, you've told me.

570
00:59:51,133 --> 00:59:53,033
Carson and the sheriff
won't be coming alone.

571
00:59:53,238 --> 00:59:55,905
They'll have fifty, sixty, maybe
a hundred men riding with them.

572
00:59:55,935 --> 00:59:59,435
More than that, Pothook. If he brings
in the Triangle Bar, the Two Sixes ...

573
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:02,880
... the Y-4 riders and the
sheriff, he'll have 107 men ...

574
01:00:02,911 --> 01:00:04,478
... when he rides through Sierra Blanca.

575
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:06,632
But we ain't got that many.
What are you gonna do?

576
01:00:06,717 --> 01:00:09,517
- Bet. Ten dollars.
- That sends me home.

577
01:00:10,175 --> 01:00:12,675
You haven't got a home, Sleepy.
None of you got homes.

578
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,040
So don't get any ideas
about leaving in a hurry.

579
01:00:15,797 --> 01:00:18,897
- I'll stay.
- That's a profound statement.

580
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:21,025
All blue, the king on top.

581
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:23,890
And we haven't time for
another hand, gentlemen.

582
01:00:25,406 --> 01:00:28,706
Fresno, you and Pothook get the line camps.
Bring in every man you find.

583
01:00:30,063 --> 01:00:31,696
Sleepy, you and Johnny
ride to the river.

584
01:00:32,419 --> 01:00:34,352
Ortega and his men are
putting a herd across there.

585
01:00:34,387 --> 01:00:36,687
- Tell 'em to leave it and ride in.
- Right.

586
01:00:46,633 --> 01:00:47,633
Whiskey.

587
01:00:53,121 --> 01:00:54,621
You can buy me a drink, mister.

588
01:00:55,266 --> 01:00:56,533
Well, Jumpy.

589
01:00:57,614 --> 01:00:59,947
Give the, uh, boy a glass of milk.

590
01:01:03,649 --> 01:01:05,116
I did that on purpose.

591
01:01:08,395 --> 01:01:11,795
- Having none of that tonight!
- Get out of my way.

592
01:01:12,046 --> 01:01:13,613
You see what he did! He hit me!

593
01:01:14,527 --> 01:01:16,460
I did, too. And my gun's out.

594
01:01:17,128 --> 01:01:21,261
Now do as you're told. Ride out
with Sleepy and bring in the men.

595
01:01:28,028 --> 01:01:31,628
A word of advice. He's faster
than a baby rattlesnake.

596
01:01:35,287 --> 01:01:36,820
And twice as dangerous.

597
01:01:38,134 --> 01:01:39,134
Thanks.

598
01:01:41,346 --> 01:01:46,579
Say, uh, where would I find
a man named Jim Bonniwell?

599
01:01:47,722 --> 01:01:49,922
Uhm, friend of yours?

600
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:52,664
Could be.

601
01:01:53,311 --> 01:01:54,777
How long since you've seen him?

602
01:01:56,709 --> 01:01:57,942
Why? Is that important?

603
01:01:58,109 --> 01:01:59,409
No. Not to me.

604
01:02:02,088 --> 01:02:03,321
You figuring to work for him?

605
01:02:03,696 --> 01:02:07,096
Put out a bottle, Rebel. We both need
a drink, and we need it right now.

606
01:02:07,178 --> 01:02:10,511
Wait a minute. I'm still
trying to find Jim Bonniwell.

607
01:02:11,259 --> 01:02:14,392
Ride north along the stage road
and turn west at the hills.

608
01:02:16,048 --> 01:02:17,048
Thanks.

609
01:02:17,546 --> 01:02:19,746
Didn't I see you ride out
from Major Carson's place?

610
01:02:19,826 --> 01:02:23,226
Yeah, he's the man. Carson wanted to
buy his gun, but he turned him down.

611
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:26,970
So now you'd like to sell it to Jim
Bonniwell, along with some information?

612
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:29,042
But you're not gonna do it.

613
01:02:29,436 --> 01:02:30,936
And who's gonna stop me?

614
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:43,331
Lock him up.

615
01:02:43,348 --> 01:02:45,315
- What about my drink?
- I'll bring it along.

616
01:02:50,435 --> 01:02:52,635
Might even give you a drink
if you behave yourself.

617
01:02:59,953 --> 01:03:00,953
Howdy, Major.

618
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:04,369
Understand you have a little
job of work that needs doing.

619
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:05,951
We're glad to have you, Dick.

620
01:03:06,406 --> 01:03:09,773
We're still waiting for the Crocker
and the boys from the Two Sixes.

621
01:03:09,909 --> 01:03:12,442
- They'll be along in about an hour.
- Glad to hear it.

622
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:14,768
Bonniwell won't be. When're
you gonna hit him?

623
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:16,873
Soon as there's light
enough for good shooting.

624
01:03:49,446 --> 01:03:51,146
Where do I find Jim Bonniwell?

625
01:03:51,447 --> 01:03:53,680
- So early in the morning?
- Where do I find him?

626
01:03:54,174 --> 01:03:56,540
Lady, this ain't a post office,
it's a saloon.

627
01:03:56,612 --> 01:03:58,778
Well, in that case, let
her have some whiskey.

628
01:03:58,982 --> 01:04:01,682
- We don't serve ladies.
- You serve this lady.

629
01:04:02,511 --> 01:04:03,511
Whiskey.

630
01:04:09,242 --> 01:04:12,775
You and me, we're gonna have those
drinks you didn't have with my brother.

631
01:04:14,824 --> 01:04:15,824
Remember him?

632
01:04:17,846 --> 01:04:20,113
Name was Jeff. You got him killed.

633
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:22,628
Jim Slater did that job.

634
01:04:25,669 --> 01:04:27,736
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

635
01:04:28,285 --> 01:04:32,252
Oh no, you're a smart girl. You know
everything. You know where he is.

636
01:04:33,006 --> 01:04:35,839
I told you the truth. I
don't know where he is.

637
01:04:36,048 --> 01:04:37,515
Maybe you just forgot.

638
01:04:39,864 --> 01:04:42,064
Have a drink. Have a lotta drinks.

639
01:04:42,249 --> 01:04:44,849
Maybe you'll remember when
you have a lotta drinks.

640
01:04:45,818 --> 01:04:48,685
- Where's Slater?
- Mr. Bonniwell ain't gonna like this.

641
01:04:48,919 --> 01:04:50,319
You were supposed to get the men.

642
01:04:50,432 --> 01:04:52,899
I got the men. Now I want Jim Slater.

643
01:04:53,013 --> 01:04:54,379
What for do you want him?

644
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,633
Oh.

645
01:04:59,121 --> 01:05:00,821
I remember you.

646
01:05:01,483 --> 01:05:03,683
- You're the funny girl.
- Am I?

647
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:06,883
I like funny girls.

648
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:09,125
I like you.

649
01:05:09,314 --> 01:05:12,848
Careful, Johnny. She was
asking to see Mr. Bonniwell.

650
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:17,444
- Fine. We'll go and see him.
- What for do you want Slater?

651
01:05:20,097 --> 01:05:21,164
I'm gonna kill him.

652
01:05:22,883 --> 01:05:24,750
You ain't gonna kill nobody.

653
01:05:30,582 --> 01:05:31,782
Who says that?

654
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:43,619
I do.

655
01:05:43,714 --> 01:05:44,714
Tony Welker.

656
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,580
Draw.

657
01:05:49,961 --> 01:05:52,328
Olson heard that shot. Now
get outta here, quick!

658
01:05:52,556 --> 01:05:55,422
Who cares about Olson? Come
on, we'll go see Bonniwell.

659
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,580
Johnny! Hold up there, Johnny!

660
01:06:01,715 --> 01:06:02,948
Something you want, Sheriff?

661
01:06:03,314 --> 01:06:05,947
- What was that shooting?
- Aw, nothing much. I just killed a man.

662
01:06:06,502 --> 01:06:08,669
Could do the same to
you if I wanted to.

663
01:06:12,518 --> 01:06:16,951
I was only fooling with the sheriff.
When I see your man, I won't be fooling.

664
01:06:17,121 --> 01:06:18,121
I'll kill him!

665
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:24,257
You're real lucky.

666
01:06:24,651 --> 01:06:27,818
We ain't gonna have to go to Jim.
He's coming to us.

667
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:30,352
Hey, Sheriff! You got company!

668
01:06:30,691 --> 01:06:32,358
That's Jim Bonniwell coming!

669
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:44,813
Which one is Bonniwell?

670
01:06:45,163 --> 01:06:48,930
Now, don't you go getting interested
in Jim. I'm gonna be your man.

671
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:02,389
What's Bonniwell doing here? I thought
Carson was gonna gun him down at the ranch.

672
01:07:02,837 --> 01:07:04,370
Carson thought so, too.

673
01:07:05,142 --> 01:07:06,909
Johnny Cool must've carried the word.

674
01:07:08,555 --> 01:07:11,222
- Am I right?
- How would I know?

675
01:07:11,314 --> 01:07:12,914
Why not? You're one
of Bonniwell's men.

676
01:07:13,149 --> 01:07:15,149
- If there's gonna be any killing ...
- Leave it alone, Dobbs.

677
01:07:15,703 --> 01:07:17,503
Put the shotgun back in the rack.

678
01:07:21,763 --> 01:07:22,896
I'll handle this.

679
01:07:51,306 --> 01:07:55,006
Ortega? Johnny? Get with Ortega!

680
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:56,310
Right, Mr. Bonniwell.

681
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:13,930
Why have you brought your men
into town, Mr. Bonniwell?

682
01:08:14,113 --> 01:08:16,913
I understand you've been talking
with some of my neighbors, Sheriff.

683
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:19,542
Talked to Major Carson and
the men at Diamond C.

684
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:20,628
Did you now?

685
01:08:21,249 --> 01:08:24,516
And did you decide to ride with him in
the morning when he raids my ranch?

686
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:27,599
No. I told him, officially, I
can't take any part in it.

687
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:29,699
- But you talked to him.
- That's right.

688
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,907
- You didn't talk to me.
- No.

689
01:08:32,396 --> 01:08:34,929
- Then you'd ride against him.
- Oh, I see.

690
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:38,798
I'm paid to keep the peace. If there's
gonna be a range war, I gotta stop it.

691
01:08:38,869 --> 01:08:42,469
Well, I am riding against him.
You're gonna stop me, huh?

692
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:46,009
- I'm gonna try, Mr. Bonniwell.
- Don't be foolish, Sheriff.

693
01:08:46,551 --> 01:08:47,551
I gotta try.

694
01:08:53,159 --> 01:08:54,192
Take care of him.

695
01:08:54,866 --> 01:08:56,666
All right, hide your
horses and spot your men.

696
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:18,513
Relax, Dobbs. I'm gonna
save you for a while.

697
01:09:20,403 --> 01:09:21,403
Lock him up.

698
01:09:30,118 --> 01:09:33,184
- What's he doing here?
- Olson figured he was one of your men.

699
01:09:35,016 --> 01:09:36,149
What's your name?

700
01:09:36,429 --> 01:09:37,429
Jim Slater.

701
01:09:40,082 --> 01:09:41,082
Let him out.

702
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:48,667
Step out here.

703
01:09:57,018 --> 01:09:58,818
- Jim Slater, huh?
- Yeah.

704
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:01,175
- Where you from?
- Texas.

705
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:05,078
Texas is a big state.
Where about in Texas?

706
01:10:05,213 --> 01:10:06,213
Nacogdoches.

707
01:10:07,396 --> 01:10:08,863
- Born there?
- Yeah.

708
01:10:10,348 --> 01:10:12,148
What are you doing in Sierra Blanca?

709
01:10:13,233 --> 01:10:14,299
Looking for you.

710
01:10:21,316 --> 01:10:23,983
I knew I kept you alive
for some reason.

711
01:10:26,967 --> 01:10:30,700
Usually, when Johnny Cool goes
for his gun, I don't interfere.

712
01:10:33,732 --> 01:10:37,332
But last night something said,
don't let that man die.

713
01:10:38,988 --> 01:10:41,021
And I was talking about my own son.

714
01:10:42,457 --> 01:10:43,590
What's on your mind?

715
01:10:44,214 --> 01:10:46,814
I've spent six months looking for a killer.

716
01:10:47,754 --> 01:10:50,087
What do you do when he turns
out to be you father?

717
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:52,722
Killer? Aren't you a little
careless with your words, son?

718
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:56,766
Yes, I kill when I have to. But I never
killed a man who wasn't trying to kill me.

719
01:10:57,195 --> 01:11:00,062
And that goes for the sheriff,
in spite of his badge.

720
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:03,480
You doubt me, huh? Come here.

721
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:13,099
In a little while, you're going to see
97 men riding through this town ...

722
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:14,447
looking to kill me.

723
01:11:15,067 --> 01:11:16,800
Olson was waiting to ride with 'em.

724
01:11:17,805 --> 01:11:20,405
It's the old, old
story of dog eat dog.

725
01:11:20,649 --> 01:11:22,916
I've got what they want, they
wanna take it away from me.

726
01:11:23,585 --> 01:11:26,918
I'm not gonna let 'em. Does
that make me a killer?

727
01:11:27,633 --> 01:11:31,033
I give you my word, son. I never killed
a man who wasn't trying to kill me.

728
01:11:31,157 --> 01:11:33,024
What about the men at Gila Valley?

729
01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:37,252
- What's your name?
- Karyl Orton.

730
01:11:37,823 --> 01:11:39,690
- I knew a Paul Orton.
- My husband.

731
01:11:39,756 --> 01:11:40,923
Oh.

732
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:43,858
He wasn't much of a man.

733
01:11:44,244 --> 01:11:48,077
He was man enough to dig $60,000
worth of gold out of the hills.

734
01:11:49,386 --> 01:11:52,753
You don't take this kinda gold out of the
the hills. You take it out of a bank.

735
01:11:53,954 --> 01:11:55,454
What are you talking about?

736
01:11:55,616 --> 01:11:59,316
Well, after the surrender, things were a
little rough on the boys who wore gray.

737
01:11:59,844 --> 01:12:02,511
But your husband got just
a little too greedy.

738
01:12:02,935 --> 01:12:05,302
So you talked things
over with the Apaches.

739
01:12:05,727 --> 01:12:07,760
Who the devil talks with an Apache?

740
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:11,358
Your husband and his friends took
my guns away, ran me outta camp.

741
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:14,160
I passed a war party
heading for the stockade.

742
01:12:14,487 --> 01:12:16,820
Lotsa rocks in Gila
Valley, so I hid out.

743
01:12:17,403 --> 01:12:19,303
And watched your partners die.

744
01:12:19,696 --> 01:12:21,763
I could think of no
reason to die with 'em.

745
01:12:22,122 --> 01:12:25,022
And there were 60,000
reasons why you shouldn't.

746
01:12:25,089 --> 01:12:26,089
Hello, Slater!

747
01:12:28,828 --> 01:12:30,295
Get back to your place, Johnny!

748
01:12:31,444 --> 01:12:32,911
Move over, funny girl.

749
01:12:41,685 --> 01:12:43,485
I'm gonna kill you, Slater.

750
01:12:43,899 --> 01:12:46,032
That shouldn't be hard.
He hasn't got a gun.

751
01:12:47,171 --> 01:12:48,171
Give him yours.

752
01:12:50,508 --> 01:12:54,841
Be careful, Mr. Bonniwell.
This time my gun's out.

753
01:13:00,521 --> 01:13:01,988
Put it in the holster.

754
01:13:17,265 --> 01:13:18,798
Call it, Mr. Bonniwell.

755
01:13:20,825 --> 01:13:21,625
Go!

756
01:13:34,448 --> 01:13:36,448
Not an easy thing to do, is it, son?

757
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:40,681
I didn't think there was a man in
the world could beat Johnny Cool.

758
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:41,770
Except me.

759
01:13:42,394 --> 01:13:44,027
- You're a Slater, Jim.
- Shut up.

760
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:46,530
- Every inch a Slater.
- Shut up!

761
01:13:54,228 --> 01:13:56,395
Why don't you leave him alone
and let him get out of here?

762
01:13:56,724 --> 01:13:58,424
Get out? Why would he wanna do that?

763
01:13:58,522 --> 01:14:00,822
Because he has a chance to lead
a decent life. He's a good man.

764
01:14:00,824 --> 01:14:02,291
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

765
01:14:03,462 --> 01:14:07,529
You could be wrong about him. True, I
haven't seen him since he was born.

766
01:14:07,616 --> 01:14:11,149
But it's my blood that flows in his veins,
and it's a little thicker than water.

767
01:14:15,609 --> 01:14:17,609
Suppose he wants to
go away with me.

768
01:14:18,864 --> 01:14:21,131
I wouldn't stop him for the world.

769
01:14:25,915 --> 01:14:27,915
We're all spotted, Mr. Bonniwell!

770
01:14:29,704 --> 01:14:31,671
- Fresno, you up on the hotel?
- Yes, sir!

771
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:35,883
- Jenkins, where are you?
- Up here, Mr. Bonniwell!

772
01:14:51,257 --> 01:14:54,790
- Jim, we're leaving. We're going away.
- No, Karyl.

773
01:14:56,310 --> 01:15:00,410
I had a ... I had a gun in my
hand, and I couldn't kill him.

774
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:04,797
- Of course you couldn't. He's your father.
- Yeah, that's right.

775
01:15:05,954 --> 01:15:08,954
I'm a ... I'm a Slater.

776
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,448
And that explains a lot of things.

777
01:15:14,005 --> 01:15:15,838
Jim, you're not going to stay here?

778
01:15:17,754 --> 01:15:18,887
Jim, you mustn't.

779
01:15:19,302 --> 01:15:21,769
Don't let him turn you into a killer.

780
01:15:22,895 --> 01:15:26,728
Maybe he did give you your hands.
Maybe he gave you a lot of things.

781
01:15:27,201 --> 01:15:30,301
- But he didn't give you what's inside you.
- I don't know what he gave me.

782
01:15:30,382 --> 01:15:33,149
Jim, we've got to get out of here.
He says it's all right.

783
01:15:33,897 --> 01:15:37,297
- He says he'll let you go.
- He says? What about Carson and his men?

784
01:15:37,341 --> 01:15:39,341
- I don't care about Carson.
- You don't care, huh?

785
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,233
He'll be riding in here with
more than a hundred men ...

786
01:15:41,278 --> 01:15:43,178
and they'll be shot
down without a chance.

787
01:15:44,054 --> 01:15:45,421
Jim, you've got to get out of here.

788
01:15:45,506 --> 01:15:51,206
No, I can't now, Karyl. I've gotten into
this and some way, I've got to finish it.

789
01:15:53,309 --> 01:15:55,442
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.

790
01:15:57,693 --> 01:16:02,293
I don't know what I'm gonna do, but
I can't let a hundred men die.

791
01:16:02,481 --> 01:16:04,314
I can't just ride away and let it happen.

792
01:16:04,716 --> 01:16:06,383
I knew you wouldn't, son.

793
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:10,039
I've tried to tell her you wouldn't ride
away and let me face my enemies alone.

794
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:14,190
Well, practically alone.

795
01:16:15,175 --> 01:16:17,275
I've waited a long while for this day.

796
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:21,490
For twenty-odd years, I waited for
one man to stand at my shoulder.

797
01:16:21,532 --> 01:16:24,932
One man I could trust.
And now I've got him.

798
01:16:25,412 --> 01:16:26,512
My own flesh and blood.

799
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:31,748
- Mr. Bonniwell, they're coming in.
- All right, stay in your places.

800
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:35,813
Every man likes to have his own gun
when things get a little warm.

801
01:16:35,893 --> 01:16:38,126
I found yours in the sheriff's office.

802
01:16:38,919 --> 01:16:43,119
- How do you know it's mine?
- Because it fits well in my hand.

803
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:45,229
Just as it does in yours.

804
01:16:50,232 --> 01:16:52,499
We got plenty of time, son. Rebel!

805
01:16:52,971 --> 01:16:55,971
Let you and me have a drink.
Celebrate the occasion.

806
01:16:56,741 --> 01:16:58,341
Bring us a fresh bottle.

807
01:17:00,135 --> 01:17:01,202
Sit down, Karyl.

808
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:10,970
All right. Now go out and tell
the men I want absolute quiet.

809
01:17:11,018 --> 01:17:12,018
Yes, sir.

810
01:17:13,617 --> 01:17:15,084
You know, I've never seen it fail.

811
01:17:15,811 --> 01:17:18,478
When you take a trigger-happy bunch
sitting it out like this ...

812
01:17:19,444 --> 01:17:22,077
somebody's bound to start
fooling with his gun.

813
01:17:22,861 --> 01:17:26,794
Ordinarily, I don't care. This is supposed
to be a sleepy little border town.

814
01:17:26,878 --> 01:17:28,678
All Carson needs is one gunshot ...

815
01:17:28,697 --> 01:17:31,764
and he'll stop his men and send in
McCloud to find out what it's all about.

816
01:17:31,959 --> 01:17:34,892
- And that would spoil everything.
- It certainly would.

817
01:17:35,009 --> 01:17:36,842
They're getting awfully close,
Mr. Bonniwell.

818
01:17:37,492 --> 01:17:40,292
Step out in the street and see how
close they are, will you, boy?

819
01:17:49,078 --> 01:17:51,211
I'm glad you're not trying
to turn him against me.

820
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:53,867
- And if I did?
- You'd be sending him to his death!

821
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:58,324
Sometimes living's not that important.

822
01:17:59,537 --> 01:18:01,837
I oughta take you with me.
You're no good.

823
01:18:03,421 --> 01:18:05,554
But Carson'll do what I can't.

824
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:06,890
Jim, don't!

825
01:18:12,762 --> 01:18:13,762
Don't shoot!

826
01:18:15,473 --> 01:18:17,406
That's exactly what
he wants us to do!

827
01:18:18,525 --> 01:18:21,025
Anybody pull the trigger
now, we're all dead!

828
01:18:25,893 --> 01:18:26,893
Jim!

829
01:18:58,484 --> 01:18:59,484
Use your gun!

830
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:37,077
This could be an ambush.
We'll surround the town!

831
01:20:44,904 --> 01:20:47,571
Mr. Bonniwell! They're pulling a circle!
What do we do?

832
01:20:58,039 --> 01:20:59,839
I'm gonna bust that circle.

833
01:21:00,509 --> 01:21:02,076
Let's hit it and head for the border!

834
01:21:20,954 --> 01:21:23,721
That's it! Ride out on
me, you yella fellas!

835
01:21:27,156 --> 01:21:28,556
They're breaking out.

836
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:36,321
This could go on a long while, son!
Let's you and me make a deal!

837
01:21:36,998 --> 01:21:38,331
What kind of a deal?

838
01:21:40,694 --> 01:21:42,727
Let's both put our guns
back in the leather!

839
01:21:43,588 --> 01:21:45,721
Then, when I give the word,
we'll both step out!

840
01:21:46,145 --> 01:21:48,445
We'll see whether you're as
fast as you old man!

841
01:21:51,964 --> 01:21:53,064
Made up your mind, son?

842
01:21:53,527 --> 01:21:54,527
Yeah.

843
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:57,001
Yeah, I've made up my mind.

844
01:22:00,356 --> 01:22:02,356
My gun's in the leather. Where's yours?

845
01:22:02,691 --> 01:22:04,291
Mine's in the leather, too.

846
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:09,550
Whenever you're ready.

847
01:22:11,813 --> 01:22:12,813
Step out!

848
01:22:13,703 --> 01:22:14,703
