1
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,822
<i>He was an orphan child
born in a snowstorm</i>

2
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,116
<i>crossin' the Great Plains.</i>

3
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:36,495
<i>Sam's cradle rocked mostly
in the back of Joe Callahan's saloon.</i>

4
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,165
<i>First sounds he heard 
were the rattlin' of dice</i>

5
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:42,418
<i>and somebody throwin' chips
on a poker table.</i>

6
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,628
<i>Seemed to influence the boy.</i>

7
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:52,136
<i>Well, Sam grew up, went to school
made a number of tried and true friends</i>

8
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,681
<i>learned how to smoke, play five-card-stud,</i>

9
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:58,100
<i>and tell tall stories,</i>

10
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,518
<i>fight and cuss.</i>

11
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:02,938
<i>That Sam also got in the habit
of takin' chances.</i>

12
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,150
<i>And, what's more,
he started gain' with the girls.</i>

13
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,656
<i>Before much longer, Sam started shavin'.</i>

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,786
<i>Heard he could make some money
workin' beef on the western plains,</i>

15
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:21,082
<i>so he headed out 
and got himself a job punchin' cattle.</i>

16
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,459
<i>Got punched himself.</i>

17
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:26,378
<i>When he wasn't ridin' herd,
he broke wild horses.</i>

18
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,297
<i>At least he tried to.</i>

19
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:32,093
<i>Met a lady in Abilene
with pink pantaloons.</i>

20
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,470
<i>Learned all about the big, wide world.</i>

21
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,893
<i>The United States government
 heard about Sam</i>

22
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,187
<i>and offered to go in partners with him.</i>

23
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,358
<i>Said him and them combined 
could lick the whole confederate army.</i>

24
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,693
<i>Sam took up the offer.</i>

25
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:53,906
<i>Did a little spying, scoutin' around.</i>

26
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,742
<i>Once damn near
liked to got his head blowed off.</i>

27
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,538
<i>General Sherman said, ”War is hell.</i> ”

28
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,873
<i>"Worse than that," Sam said,</i>

29
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,875
<i>"the pay's bad."</i>

30
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,963
<i>After the war,
Sam tried his hand at business.</i>

31
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,297
<i>Failed.</i>

32
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,051
<i>Rode shotgun on a stagecoach,
traded mules,</i>

33
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,137
<i>did some work for the rail road.</i>

34
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,724
<i>One time or another, he had a little money,
but always managed to lose it.</i>

35
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:27,356
<i>Well, Sam grew a little older,
though not much wiser.</i>

36
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,485
<i>Besides women,
his taste ran to good music</i>

37
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,071
<i>and strong cigars.</i>

38
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,447
<i>Oh, incidentally,</i>

39
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,909
<i>Sam never got over the habit
of takin' chances.</i>

40
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,072
So long, fella.

41
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,118
<i>Awakee napa, Goholo.</i>

42
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,881
<i>I know it ain't none of my business, mister,
but was that your horse?</i>

43
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,633
It used to be.

44
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:38,552
Well, what the hell happened?

45
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:41,013
I lost him in a card game.

46
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,140
And you paid up to a Yaqui?

47
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,183
That's right.

48
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,733
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

49
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,153
- You got any rye?
- You betcha.

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,280
Are you buyin' for two?

51
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,367
Ma'am, I'm gonna save you and me
a whole lotta trouble.

52
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,868
What do you mean by that?

53
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,828
All I'm in the market for is a hot bath.

54
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,206
That sounds wonderful.

55
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,167
- You got a tub?
- Back room. Two bits.

56
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,669
Jed, you shoe my horse?

57
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,212
- This afternoon, Pete.
- Thanks.

58
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,797
- Hi, Agnes.
- Hi.

59
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,383
- Clem, my bath ready yet?
- You betcha.

60
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,634
Thank you.

61
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:24,473
Here's for the rye, and here's for the tub.

62
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,100
You'll have to wait your turn, mister.

63
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,935
Blacksmith put in his bid this morning.

64
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,854
I don't have time for him to be first.
I gotta meet the stage.

65
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,690
I got an important meeting with a lady.

66
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,817
You'll have to settle that with him, mister.

67
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,033
Howdy.

68
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,451
Howdy.

69
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:48,872
I... I'll give you a dollar,
and I'll take the bath first, huh?

70
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,416
Nope.

71
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,294
- You're a blacksmith, huh?
- Yep.

72
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,546
My name's Sam Whiskey.

73
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,715
My name's Jedidiah Hooker.

74
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,552
Those cavalry britches you got on?

75
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,554
Yep.

76
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,891
Well, <i>I'll</i> give you $2.00,
and I'll take the bath first.

77
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,351
Nope.

78
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,437
How much?

79
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,066
Mister, could you please
take your hand out of my bath water?

80
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,278
I bet if I was to shove your head
in that tub, you'd change your mind.

81
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,447
Which of your two legs
you want broke first?

82
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,033
What... What the...

83
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:31,415
I'll tell you what, mister.
Marguerite'll get some water

84
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,959
and swab you down
by the corral personally.

85
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,628
Then you can be all washed up with...

86
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,472
A man sure has a hard time
gettin' a bath in this town.

87
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,936
If you hit me with that spittoon,
I'm not gonna like it.

88
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,120
Hold it!

89
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,758
Pardon me.

90
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,417
Let's everybody calm down
before somebody gets hurt.

91
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,670
That's for the damages,

92
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,173
and, Marshal,
that's for disturbing the peace.

93
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,009
I'll just take my bath someplace else.

94
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,178
Good idea.

95
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,393
Thanks.

96
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:18,188
If you still want that bath,
there's a horse trough down at my place.

97
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,982
You're welcome to use it.

98
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,651
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

99
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,237
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

100
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,866
<i>Mary McCarty loves whiskey and...</i>

101
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,371
You know, you're a
pretty fair fighter for a blacksmith.

102
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,206
But you need to work on your timing.

103
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,126
- I'll try and remember that.
- I'll give you a little piece of advice.

104
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,546
During a fight, try to keep calm.
Never lose your temper.

105
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,423
<i>I'll</i> keep that in mind.

106
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,342
One more thing,
never lead with your right hand.

107
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,721
You know what I mean?
Keep your right hand back here like this.

108
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,055
Lead with your left.

109
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,391
Yeah, I get the idea.

110
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,310
Good.

111
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,814
You probably didn't realize it,

112
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:04,067
but I'm one of the most feared
fighting men in this part of the country.

113
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,069
I didn't know that.

114
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,408
I guess I'm lucky to come out alive.

115
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,538
- How do?
- Howdy.

116
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,457
Mrs. Laura Breckenridge.

117
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,876
She is in number seven. Upstairs.

118
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,085
Thank you.

119
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,031
Hi. Mrs. Laura Breckenridge?

120
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,868
- You're...
- Whiskey.

121
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,328
Sam Whiskey.

122
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,622
Something wrong?

123
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,667
Please come in.

124
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,047
You are the lady
that tipped me the telegraph

125
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,384
about if I did something for you,
you'd give me $5,000?

126
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,637
Please forgive me. Priscilla just died.

127
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,056
- Priscilla?
- My bird.

128
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,142
That's a shame.

129
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,561
Would you bury her?

130
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:23,647
Lady, I didn't come 400 miles
to bury your bird.

131
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,566
Of course not.

132
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,652
Have you ever heard
of the Pinkerton Detective Agency?

133
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:33,365
Yeah, sort of.
I shot Ben Pinkerton in the leg one time.

134
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,202
Yeah. He was runnin'
a spy service for the Union army.

135
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,163
- It was an accident.
- It must've been.

136
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,332
His agency highly recommended you.

137
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,542
That's good.

138
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,294
Mr. Whiskey...

139
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,795
Mr. Whiskey.

140
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,799
There's a quarter of a million dollars
in gold bars

141
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,553
sunk on the bottom of the Platte River
in the steamboat Bonnie <i>Blue.</i>

142
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,846
My husband stole it.

143
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,348
You got yourself
a very enterprising husband.

144
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,975
Had. He's dead.

145
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,059
Oh, sorry.

146
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,187
He took it from the United States Mint
in Denver, Colorado,

147
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:07,274
and I want you to put it back in the mint.

148
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,860
You want me to put it back in the mint?

149
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,111
That's right.

150
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,325
Lady, there's two things
I don't mess around with,

151
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,826
one is an Apache squaw,

152
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,745
and the other
is the United States government.

153
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,206
Mr. Whiskey, there is a senator,
a former governor,

154
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,584
and two generals in our family.

155
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,919
We have one
of the oldest names in Oklahoma.

156
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,671
Well, that's wonderful.

157
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,883
Why don't you tell them to bury your dead
bird and I'll just go on about my business.

158
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,552
Because, Mr. Whiskey,
if that gold isn't returned,

159
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,721
I'm the one who will have to go to jail.

160
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,641
And I'd rather die first.

161
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,101
You should've thought about that
before you got yourself involved.

162
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,854
I should have, but I didn't.

163
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:48,315
If I was the President, lady,
and you stole the White House

164
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,068
and both halls of Congress,
I'd only give you six months.

165
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,862
But if I don't keep myself out of jail,
nobody else will.

166
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:57,741
Haven't you ever found yourself involved
in things where there was no way out?

167
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:00,869
You didn't want it,
and you didn't approve of it, but...

168
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,747
...there was just nothing else you could do.

169
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,333
Yeah. But this ain't one of them times.

170
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,794
Can I ask you just one favor?

171
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,589
Let me tell you how it happened
before you say no.

172
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,342
All right. But you're wasting your time.

173
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:21,390
I married Phillips Breckenridge when
he was a promising young congressman.

174
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:25,644
He seemed honest and principled,
courageous, clever.

175
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,521
My mother didn't like him.

176
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,106
She warned me,

177
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:33,652
but I wanted to live in Washington,
see all the excitement of the Capitol.

178
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,446
Phillips was very ambitious.

179
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,866
When the opportunity presented itself
to become famous overnight,

180
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,618
he grabbed it.

181
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,914
He borrowed enough gold from the mint
to finance a rebellion in lower California.

182
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:50,502
The result would've been a new republic,
the same way Texas began,

183
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,422
with my husband
as first president of that republic.

184
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,382
But the riverboat sank. Now I gotta go.

185
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:59,261
The agents of Benito Juarez
didn't want another piece of Mexico lost,

186
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:03,223
and expansion is no longer
a popular word in Washington.

187
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,225
There's a new administration.

188
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,233
Well, we've had a nice talk,
lady, and I hope you get...

189
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,568
No. Mr. Whiskey!

190
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,320
When they start minting coins
in Denver next month,

191
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:21,408
I don't want them to discover the lead bars
Phillips put back in place of the gold.

192
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,160
Yeah, you have got yourself a problem.

193
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,787
Don't be so hasty!

194
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,165
Look inside, Mr. Whiskey.

195
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,583
What do you see?

196
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:36,298
Instead of the 5,000,
I'm prepared to pay you $7,500,

197
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,841
if you'll do it.

198
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,845
How 'bout 10,000?

199
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:47,017
Do you know there's 14 different kinds
of river pirates and bushwhackers

200
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,186
between here and the Platte River?

201
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,563
Pinkerton said you could do anything.

202
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,482
He did?

203
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,359
And now I'm sure of it.

204
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,531
What would happen,
when I got that pile of gold,

205
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,742
if I just kept it for myself?

206
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,869
Uncle Morgan would have you shot.

207
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,538
Uncle Morgan?

208
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,124
He's the General in the family.

209
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,754
Well, I've thought it all over...

210
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,257
...and I think <i>I'll</i> just be on my way.

211
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,678
You certainly have got
an active disposition.

212
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,306
-12,500.
- No!

213
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,641
I can't handle it.

214
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:32,020
I can see right now it's gonna take
at least two more men besides myself.

215
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,564
$15,000.

216
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:41,071
Mr. Whiskey, that is absolutely
all I have to pay you.

217
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,614
Please say you'll do it.

218
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,074
Please?

219
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:56,586
<i>I'll</i> pay you half the 20,000 now,
and the other half when you've finished.

220
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,964
I'm damn near finished already.

221
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,218
You have no idea how much better I feel

222
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,595
knowing with your help,
I won't have to go to prison.

223
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,097
Yeah.

224
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,766
I just hope it isn't the other way around.

225
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:14,020
I think it's wonderful chivalry isn't dead.

226
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,940
- You don't mind if I count it, do you?
- Of course not.

227
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,777
Now, the <i>Bonnie Blue</i> went down
in that narrow channel,

228
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,946
right there where the arrow's pointing.

229
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:26,741
I'll meet you on the road between there
and Denver a week from today.

230
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,451
By then, you should have the gold,

231
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,329
and I should have the blueprints
of the mint for you.

232
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,789
Good luck.

233
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,583
LWlneedit

234
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,293
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

235
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,006
Mr. Whiskey?

236
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,384
It was nice doing business with you.

237
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,599
Likewise, Mrs. Breckenridge.

238
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,810
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

239
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,845
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

240
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,350
You own this shop?

241
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,935
Nope.

242
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,272
This your horse?

243
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,523
Yep.

244
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:47,238
Did you ever see
a Presbyterian wrestle a bear?

245
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,740
Nope.

246
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,746
I'll bet you didn't know President
Rutherford B. Hayes had a glass eye.

247
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,707
What the hell do you want?

248
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,835
How'd you like to go to work for me?

249
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,796
Nope.

250
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,053
That's $100.

251
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,932
Bet you can't lift that anvil.

252
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,705
On one leg.

253
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,212
Doggone! You did it!

254
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,756
You win the bet.

255
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,009
Now how'd you like to help me get
a quarter of a million dollars

256
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,761
worth of gold bars off the bottom
of the Platte River?

257
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,600
How'd you like to help me get a quarter
of a million dollars-worth of gold bars

258
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,144
off the bottom of the Platte River?

259
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,228
Just you and me?

260
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,355
No, I'm figuring on picking up
a friend along the way.

261
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,733
- I'll think about it.
- Good.

262
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,193
You can leave that here.

263
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,368
Sam!

264
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:34,846
Good luck.

265
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,097
Thanks.

266
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,115
<i>Mary McCarty was shy as a primrose</i>

267
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:57,660
<i>Skin was as fair as the dew of the May</i>

268
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:01,456
<i>And though she was tempted
she never surrendered</i>

269
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:05,168
<i>Her virtue more often
than four times a day</i>

270
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,003
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

271

<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

272
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,632
<i>Mary McCarty loved whiskey and...</i>

273
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,509
I knew a man named George one time.

274
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,718
Used to sing a lot.

275
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:14,969
They hanged him.

276
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,429
Is that a fact?

277
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,555
Yep.

278
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,557
I knew a wheelwright named Abercrombie.

279
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,309
Looked a whole lot like you.

280
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,063
Had two wives
back in Frackville, Pennsylvania.

281
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,941
One was a Mormon lady.
The other a Baptist.

282
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,567
I used to work for him.

283
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,320
He paid me 25 cents an hour
to make wagon wheels.

284
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,198
I'll tell you something else,
he was mean as hell.

285
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,660
Abercrombie went into the Army
as a captain.

286
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,497
First battle he got into,
an enlisted man named Tom shot him.

287
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,707
That doesn't sound like an accident.

288
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,459
I wouldn't know.

289
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,712
Well, go on! What happened next?

290
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,339
When the war was over,

291
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,800
Tom went to Frackville
and married Abercrombie's widow,

292
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,385
the Baptist one.

293
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,554
I'll be damned.

294
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,265
What happened to the Mormon widow?

295
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,724
Went out west.

296
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,977
Started her own wagon wheel business.

297
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,230
Married an apothecary, had seven children.

298
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,817
Was the first lady to win
the blue ribbon for rhubarb pies

299
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,902
three years runnin'.

300
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,445
Tell me something, Jed.

301
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,614
Do you know all that for a fact?

302
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,741
Just thought it up as I went along.

303
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,076
Helped pass the time.

304
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:27,584
<i>The girls in the city are skinny and pretty</i>

305
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,962
<i>Girls in the country
have meat on their bones</i>

306
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:35,675
<i>But Mary McCarty
could give them all lessons</i>

307
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:39,721
<i>In loving contortions and delicate moans</i>

308
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,639
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

309
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,600
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

310
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,520
<i>Mary McCarty loved whiskey and gin</i>

311
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:58,239
I'll tell you what, Samuel.

312
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,617
You gotta adjust this thing
to fit your own eye.

313
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,285
Now, you were shootin' low out there,

314
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:07,123
so we'll put that front side
right about there for you.

315
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,376
Takes a little time,
but once you get the hang of it...

316
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,592
I'll be damned.

317
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,803
Built it all myself, Sam.
Fires 300 rounds a minute.

318
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,514
The British gun Hotchkiss
fires 200 rounds a minute

319
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,350
and weighs 10 pounds more.

320
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,436
- The French have got a gun...
- You come with a gun, O.W.?

321
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,776
Samuel, I...
Dat gum it, Sam, you know why.

322
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,903
I've been trying to discipline myself.

323
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,489
I'm through with all that chasm' around.

324
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,908
I'm an inventor and a businessman now.

325
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,618
Wouldn't change your mind, would you?

326
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,037
No, sir. No, lwouldn't.

327
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,164
I'll take you in on shares.

328
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,833
You, me, and Jed there.

329
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:54,504
Shares?

330
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,256
What's this?

331
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,174
Automatic corn sheller.

332
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,012
I'll sell you the guns, Sam.

333
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,305
But that's all.

334
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:06,391
- That's all?
- That's right.

335
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,268
Well, the least you can do
is give us some supper.

336
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,770
Already got it on the stove cookin'.

337
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:24,742
A little something to wet the whistle with.

338
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,703
- Is that com?
- Yeah.

339
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,496
If you don't mind, <i>I'll</i> stick to rye.

340
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,540
Sure. Go right ahead.

341
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,209
- Jed, you a poker player?
- Nope.

342
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,878
- You wanna learn?
- No, I don't.

343
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,757
Well, I can't says I blame you.

344
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,593
Jed, did I ever tell you that O.W. here

345
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,471
was the hardest drinkin',
hardest fightin' man

346
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:47,265
that General Sherman ever had?

347
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,017
Nope.

348
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,768
<i>Salud, amigos.</i>

349
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:54,230
- Salud.
- To old times.

350
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:02,238
I don't suppose you'd have any trouble

351
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,699
figurin' out a way a man
could do some work under water

352
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,743
at, say, 15 or 20 feet, would you?

353
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,329
Work 15 or 20 feet under water?

354
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,248
I suppose a good size bucket,

355
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,625
some leather hose
and a bellows oughta do it.

356
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,002
Why? What do ya got in mind?

357
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,881
You remember the time you won $100

358
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,091
bettin' how far
you could throw a cannonball?

359
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,218
Yeah.

360
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,846
I can't do that kind of stuff anymore.
I got a hitch in my back.

361
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:32,435
Oh, I bet you could still outdrink old Jed
and I here put together, if you wanted to.

362
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,645
<i>Salud.</i>

363
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,565
Well, yeah, I probably could, but...

364
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:41,569
...that kind of stuff doesn't fit in with being
an inventor and a businessman.

365
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,488
Yeah.

366
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:47,575
Must take a lot of hard-earned cash to
come up with one of those inventions, huh?

367
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:48,785
Yeah, it sure does.

368
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:52,705
Did I tell you that, after expenses,
your share will come to well over $5,000?

369
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,791
Over $5,000?

370
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,334
Over $5,000.

371
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,046
- Bet ten cents.
- Salud.

372
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:04,801
Well, what do ya got?

373
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,470
What do ya got?

374
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,805
Pair of nines and fives.

375
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,808
One pair. You win.

376
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:18,481
You figure, a hose
and a bucket'll do it, huh?

377
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,109
Well, I can't say for sure till it's tried.

378
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,235
Yeah.

379
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,154
What kind of work
you gonna do underwater?

380
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,657
We're gonna haul up
a quarter of a million dollars in gold bars

381
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,492
off the bottom of the Platte River.

382
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:33,496
<i>Salud.</i>

383
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,475
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

384
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,185

<i>O.W. Bandy loves whiskey and gin</i>

386
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,527
- Everything on?
- Yep.

387
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:10,867
You know, O.W., once your head clears up

388
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,036
and you get some
of that cottonwood smell in your lungs,

389
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,413
you'll feel great.

390
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,066
Sam, stop this wagon.

391
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,651
Sorry, O.W. I can't do it.

392
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,069
Sam, I'm tellin' ya to...

393
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,697
We got a lot of work ahead,
and not much time to do it in.

394
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,741
Your share of the money's in your boot.

395
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,784
Just like I told you, we're partners.

396
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,460
Ain't we?

397
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:07,256
What the hell are you doin'?
Let go of that wheel.

398
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,050
I wanna talk to you, Sam.

399
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,943
- Can't it wait?
- No, it can't.

400
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,616
What's the matter with you? You damn
near caused the wagon to turn over.

401
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,368
It's my wagon, ain't it?

402
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,915
Look, we're partners, ain't we?

403
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:44,252
Sam, I'm a man
who hates to lose his temper.

404
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,132
I suppose what you're trying to tell me

405
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,134
is that you could knock me on my can
if you wanted to.

406
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,469
I figure!

407
00:25:56,639 --> 00:26:01,811
I suppose you think what happened
last night was a dirty trick on a friend.

408
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,396
I sure do!

409
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,234
All right, then. Hit me.

410
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,153
I don't wanna hit you.

411
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,115
No, go on. Hit me.

412
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,659
Wouldn't be half enough
for what I did to you.

413
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,035
Go on. Hit me.

414
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,832
<i>I'll</i> tell you what... You hit me.

415
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,678
Tryin' to trick you into a deal

416
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,140
where you make a lot of money
so you can become a rich man.

417
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,142
Become a famous inventor.

418
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,144
A man oughta be stoned for that.

419
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,229
Hit me again.

420
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,023
Now, I deserve it.

421
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,784
It don't make sense...

422
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,370
Letting a man get away
with a thing like that.

423
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:06,042
Ain't no punishment bad enough

424
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:10,046
for a man who'd
pull a dirty trick like that on a friend.

425
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,259
Well, O.W.?

426
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,388
Let's go.

427
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,229
Jed?

428
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,357
Thanks?

429
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,192
Any time, Sam.

430
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,654
Git up. Come on.

431
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,478
Go ahead and pump.

432
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,774
How's it feel?

433
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,402
Not as good as a new Stetson hat.

434
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,601
Evenin'.

435
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,687
Well, howdy, neighbor.

436
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,281
Did you ever see a man
run with his throat cut?

437
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,615
Not lately.

438
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,416
Nothing in here looks like a map.

439
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,336
- Where is it?
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.

440
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,839
The map. Where is it?

441
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,340
Look, you out my throat,

442
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,593
and I won't know what the hell
you're talkin' about!

443
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,470
Where is it?

444
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,847
I can't think with that knife in my throat!

445
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:27,683
Is that better?

446
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:28,809
Sam.

447
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:29,935
Yeah?

448
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,521
I think I know
what they might be looking for!

449
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:36,525
All right, then you tell me
what the hell they're lookin' for!

450
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:39,361
That chart you got
under the books in the wagon!

451
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,701
There's nothin' in here.

452
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:47,703
Hey, Jack.

453
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,372
I think your friend is playing games with us.

454
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:53,209
Why don't you just stick
your shotgun in his snoot

455
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,753
and let's see how far he splatters.

456
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,839
Maybe it'll help his friend
remember about the map.

457
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,921
Where in damnation were you?

458
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,215
Who? Me?

459
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,093
I was right here.

460
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,762
Page 83.

461
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,644
The river's just up ahead!

462
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,034
There it is, gentlemen!

463
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,746
The <i>last remains
of the steamboat Bonnie Blue.</i>

464
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,167
And you want me to swim out there
with a bucket on my head,

465
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,086
go down in 15 feet of water,

466
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,505
and fish around for some old box?

467
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:08,052
I don't see anything unreasonable
about that. You, O.W.?

468
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,304
Not offhand.

469
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,015
- Then you do it.
- I can't swim.

470
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,183
Say, friend!

471
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:17,937
Would you mind rowing to shore
a minute? I'd like to talk to ya!

472
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:22,858
O.W., think we oughta
spend some of our money and,

473
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,653
buy Jed here a boat
so he don't have to do any swimmin'?

474
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,154
Well, if you're gonna work in the water,

475
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:29,615
a boat's a pretty handy item
to have around.

476
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,367
I'd say it's a good investment.

477
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,868
Couldn't agree more.

478
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,792
- Howdy, friend.
- Howdy.

479
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,880
How'd you like to sell that boat?

480
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:47,091
How much you gimme for it?

481
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:50,469
$10 for the boat,
2 for the fish, and 2 for the jug.

482
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,262
Don't see why you want a boat for.

483
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,765
You can't take that wagon across on it.

484
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,643
Well, don't you worry none
about that, friend.

485
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,687
We're just good-natured rich folk.

486
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,897
Wanna do a little fishin' and drinkin'.

487
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,235
Cousin Leroy made this.

488
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,987
Have a bite out of it.

489
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,488
Thanks.

490
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,328
<i>I'll</i> tell you what,

491
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:19,957

492
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,418

Fifteen.

Good-natured rich folk

who just wanna do
a little fishin' and drinkin'?

504
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,204
That's what he said.

505
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,749
'Course, I ain't never seen fishin'
done like that before.

506
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:05,252
I wonderjust how rich they are.

507
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,129
All right.

508
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,882
Follow the smokestack down
till you get to the main deck.

509
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,217
Then you look in the first cabin
on the right-hand side.

510
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,470
If you get in trouble, yank on this.

511
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,482
You all right, Jed?

512
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,691
Yep.

513
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,318
Nice river to get drowned in.

514
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,402
Not too muddy.

515
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,156
Down you go!

516
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,620
I've seen enough.

517
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,540
Let's go.

518
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,495
Jed?

519
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:11,837
Yeah.

520
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,641
I wonder if we shouldn't have
a larger bellows.

521
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,560
Or perhaps more sense.

522
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,521
What's the matter, don't you wanna be
a rich man? Never have to work again?

523
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:31,481
I like work. Enjoy it.

524
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:35,444
All right, three or four pretty girls buzzin'.

525
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:36,904
A homely girl'll treat you better.

526
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,739
You know, Jed, you're right.

527
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,075
I remember Plato quoting Socrates
as saying about the same thing.

528
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,536
Takin' a chance with your life
for more money than you need

529
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,330
is just plain foolishness.

530
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:47,456
Is that a fact?

531
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,877
Don't tell me you never heard
of the pure and clean greed for gold.

532
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,337
That's what makes the world go round.

533
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:54,963
I've heard it said.

534
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,549
Now, what the hell's that
supposed to mean?

535
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,509
D'you know that two parts permanganate,

536
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:02,221
three parts of sulfur,
and one part of lard will...

537
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,432
...kill hookworms?

538
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,769
If that stuff isn't worth riskin'
your neck for, why don't you wait around

539
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,313
till you get to heaven
for your reward, and I'll keep your share.

540
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,523
No. <i>I'll</i> save it,

541
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:17,319
have a family of my own,
and buy my own bathtub.

542
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,829
<i>She's a jolly good fellow</i>

543
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,249
<i>She's a jolly good fellow</i>

544
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,459
<i>She's a jolly good fellow</i>

545
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,503
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

546
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,505
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

547
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,465
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

548
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:40,801
<i>She's a jolly good fellow</i>

549
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,886
<i>She's a jolly good fellow</i>

550
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,514
<i>She's a jolly good fellow</i>

551
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,725
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

552
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,731
Listen, Big Annie, this man here,

553
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,609
he's got some business
you just might be interested in.

554
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:58,860
Business?

555
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:00,654
How d'you do, ma'am?

556
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:03,490
I'd like the help
of some of your boys for shares.

557
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,243
- Shares? Shares of what?
- Listen, Big Annie.

558
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:09,371
He says there was gold on the <i>Bonnie
Blue</i> when she sank in the channel.

559
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,039
- Gold.
- Yeah.

560
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,333
You'll get 10% for your share in helping.

561
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:21,341
Listen, honey, I don't do nothin' for 10%.

562
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:31,226
But I'd be glad to have my boys go along
with a nice, fat man like you 50/50 split.

563
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:45,634
Put your hands up!

564
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,429
Put 'em up!

565
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:54,851
The next one's liable to kill ya!
Now, put 'em up!

566
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:02,401
I've found it!

567
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,119
Get outta the way!

568
00:40:57,998 --> 00:40:59,666
Get him, Tom. Go on, get him!

569
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:27,903
What would Plato, Socrates,
and them people have to say about this?

570
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,988
I wish I knew.

571
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:33,575
Maybe they've never been
in quite this situation.

572
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:50,675
That's it. The last one.

573
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:53,762
Well, boys, I'd say we had ourselves a day.

574
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,181
<i>Let's go in and have some supper.</i>

575
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,152
That feller that drowned,

576
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,613
he said my whiskey were no good, huh?

577
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:16,493
Well, he was just a poor judge
of the finer things in life.

578
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:21,915
You know what Fat Man and me
is gonna do to you after dinner?

579
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,419
We gonna slice you up a little.

580
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:28,838
Both of ya.

581
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,467
And you know what we're gonna do?

582
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,554
We're gonna cut your buttons off,

583
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:38,306
and just watch you hop around and holler.

584
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,308
That's what we gonna do.

585
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,352
You know somethin', O.W.?

586
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:45,021
I don't think he likes us.

587
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,484
Haul! Haul!

588
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,820
Put your backs into it.

589
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:55,282
That's more like it. Haul!

590
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:58,660
I had that guy...

591
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:01,329
To hear you talk, Stanley,
you'd think you'd done all the fightin'!

592
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:02,956
I had a hold of him, didn't I?

593
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:06,334
You got more pollywog blood in you
than fightin' blood! <i>I'll</i> tell you that!

594
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,920
- All he did was ride.
- I got a crick in my neck.

595
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:10,005
Ready?

596
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:12,799
Ready.

597
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,699
"Presented to O.W. Bandy

598
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:40,827
"by his loving parents, Jonah and Ruth.

599
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,206
"Have mercy upon us, Oh, Lord.

600
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:50,420
"Consider my trouble which I suffer
at the hands of them who hate me."

601
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:53,256
13th verse, 9th Psalm.

602
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:56,551
"Have mercy upon us, oh, Lord.

603
00:43:56,718 --> 00:44:02,557
"Thou that lifteth me up
from the gates of death."

604
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:07,145
Gentlemen, they're all yours.

605
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,959
Say, you know, I think maybe
Sam didn't drown after all.

606
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,380
Either that, or that's the liveliest pair
of underwear I have ever seen.

607
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:25,640
Sure is lovely stuff.

608
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:28,643
Sure is.

609
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,313
O.W.! Let's get goin'!

610
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:14,939
Well, that way is Denver.

611
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:19,486
And that way is Mexico.

612
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,118
Mr. Whiskey!

613
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,291
Hi.

614
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,586
Hiya.

615
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,046
Hello.

616
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,716
Mr. Whiskey, hi!

617
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:53,645
Tell me something. You had much trouble
finding us here in the middle of nowhere?

618
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:58,107
Calculations. A lady has ways
of making calculations.

619
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,901
You like my perfume?

620
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:05,114
Well, I don't pay much attention to
that kind of stuff during business hours.

621
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:06,741
Of course you don't.

622
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:11,120
Now, would a blueprint of the mint be
something you would pay attention to?

623
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:12,372
I might.

624
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,582
And if I showed you some photographs?

625
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,000
That'd be nice.

626
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:19,754
Now, this is the mint building
from the outside.

627
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:21,548
And these are the architectural plans.

628
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:24,259
Uncle Morgan buys them
from the Treasury Department.

629
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,763
You know, that gold must weigh
damn near a thousand pounds.

630
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,598
How do you think I'm gonna get it
through the front door,

631
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,517
carry it in my back pocket?

632
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:36,271
This is the floor plan of the vault room.

633
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:37,689
I'll tell ya somethin' else,

634
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:41,025
you know we damn near
got killed twice since we left Pawnee?

635
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,903
I'll bet that was Fat Henry Hobson.

636
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,905
Somehow, he found out about that gold

637
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:48,241
and has been trying to get
his hands on it ever since.

638
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:51,786
What do you mean? Why the hell didn't
you tell me about Fat Henry Hobson?

639
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,788
I wasn't sure he was still at it.

640
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,875
And, besides, I knew you could
take care of anything that happened.

641
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,127
Wonderful.
How'd you know that?

642
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:00,670
Well, because I do.

643
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:05,300
Just like I know you can take care of those
extra guards they've assigned to the mint.

644
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,052
- What extra guards?
-well, they always do that just...

645
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:10,555
What the hell you talkin' about,
extra guards?

646
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,433
Before they have minting,
they put on extra guards,

647
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:16,769
and I just found out about it.

648
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,772
Look, lady, maybe you think
I don't mind going to prison for 20 years,

649
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,233
but what about my friends
back there, O.W. and Jed?

650
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:24,861
Honey, I know you can manage.
All you have to do is put your mind...

651
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:27,363
All I have to do is get
the hell outta this buggy,

652
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,073
give you back your money, and quit.

653
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:31,993
Bushwhackers, extra guards,
what the hell you gonna do...

654
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,204
If you just let me show you the plans.
I've got the blueprints.

655
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:39,000
Sam, I know you can figure out
a way. You promised.

656
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:41,794
I did?

657
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:49,302
Well, if I only knew exactly how many
guards there were on each floor.

658
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,220
I could find out.

659
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:52,972
Good.

660
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:55,725
Only that doesn't solve getting in.

661
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,812
Getting in. That's the problem.

662
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,272
I know.

663
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:04,943
Takes careful planning.

664
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,694
It does.

665
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:10,406
One little mistake, and we'll
regret it the rest of our lives.

666
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,574
You're right.

667
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,911
I can't afford to take
any unnecessary chances.

668
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:16,329
I agree.

669
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:19,666
Well, I'll figure out a way somehow.

670
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,042
I know you will.

671
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:41,354
I'll raise ya two gold bars.

672
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:48,152
What's that?

673
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:49,737
<i>Poulet Chateau.</i>

674
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,739
I should've had some white wine.

675
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:56,744
If you ever go to jail, lady, I bet
the warden's gonna ask you to marry him.

676
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:01,916
And make you the chief cook
of the whole establishment.

677
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:05,420
Cards?

678
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,216
I'll take one.

679
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:18,433
Sam, you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

680
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:21,853
Did you cheat just then?

681
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:28,359
Sam, it's not my gold.
It belongs to the U.S. men in Denver.

682
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,278
Now, why do you cheat?

683
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:34,323
Well, I may never get a chance again
to cheat for a pot that size.

684
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:36,951
Gentlemen...

685
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,454
Dinner is served.

686
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:01,476
We shouldn't have much trouble.

687
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:04,854
All we have to do is fight
half the United States Army, then...

688
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:07,023
...fly in a window like a bird.

689
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,567
With a quarter million dollars
worth of gold on your tail.

690
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,152
Nothin' to it.

691
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:12,278
Yeah.

692
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:24,165
I'll go on to the hotel. You see
if you can find a blacksmith's shop.

693
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,249
Git up.

694
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:56,948
That looks like it'll do.

695
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,617
Well, let's see if he's interested in money.

696
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,868
Git up.

697
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:09,252
- Howdy, friend.
- Howdy.

698
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:11,671
Nice lookin' place you got here.

699
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,673
Thank you.

700
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:16,551
I was just wondering,

701
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:19,137
you do your business cash or credit?

702
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,388
<i>Cash.</i>

703
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,390
Like this?

704
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,142
That'll do.

705
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,560
What kind of forge you got?

706
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:26,769
Smithfield.

707
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:31,899
You fellas want your horses shod?

708
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:35,069
No, thanks.
My friend here is a smith himself.

709
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:37,280
Wants to bend a little iron.

710
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,447
Take him about a week.

711
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:42,493
In my shop? I don't let nobody
mess around in my shop.

712
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,872
You ever think about takin'
a vacation for a week? Goin' fishin'?

713
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,916
You mean, and you do
the smithin' yourself?

714
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,209
That's the idea.

715
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:52,086
Well, I don't know.

716
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,964
I just don't like
strangers usin' my tools.

717
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,967
And... Mister...

718
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,261
- You made yourself a deal!
- Fine!

719
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,847
Now, you rest up. Do a little fishin'.

720
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,223
We'll see you back here next Friday.

721
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,601
You rest up and do some fishin'.

722
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:11,105
Me, I'm gonna spend a whole week
down at Fanny Barton's place.

723
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:17,653
How big is that bust of Washington?

724
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,614
Life-size.

725
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:24,952
What about this empty building next door
to the mint, how far away is it?

726
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:30,208
Honey, if you're thinking about a tunnel,
there's no time.

727
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,626
Why not?

728
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:36,339
Well, I just found out the mint inspector's
coming in on the train tonight.

729
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:38,299
Tonight?

730
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:40,843
He starts checking day after tomorrow.

731
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:45,973
- You know what I like about you?
- My $20,000.

732
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:47,058
No.

733
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,727
These little surprises.

734
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,813
Just how in the hell am I supposed
to get the real gold into the mint

735
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:55,650
and the phony gold out of the mint
in 48 hours?

736
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,444
Darling, I have supreme confidence in you.

737
00:53:58,486 --> 00:53:59,904
That's wonderful.

738
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,157
What time is the train due?

739
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:04,742
Oh, not until 11:15.

740
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:08,162
He's a new man.

741
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:10,164
Never been to Denver before.

742
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:12,250
His name is Thorston Bromley.

743
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:14,752
Do you know what he looks like?

744
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,630
Well, he's about your size.
Maybe a little smaller.

745
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:18,881
He wears glasses.

746
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:52,373
Wait, honey, I wanna talk to you!
I have to tell you something!

747
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:53,749
Wait! I wanna talk to you!

748
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,710
No!

749
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:58,754
- I wanna talk to you!
- Leave me alone!

750
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,214
- Leave me!
- Hold it.

751
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:01,465
- Get out of the way!
- Please help me.

752
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:04,135
Unhand her, sir. Leave the lady alone!

753
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:06,137
Will you stop it!

754
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,597
Thank you so much for helping me.

755
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:12,768
The Garden Hotel, please.

756
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:14,228
Yes, ma'am.

757
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:18,899
So far so good.

758
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:24,071
Say, Sam, what was it
I'm supposed to say again?

759
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,576
Aha! I caught you trifling with my wife.

760
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:32,747
Aha. I caught you trifling with my wife.

761
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:36,208
Aha! I caught you trifling with my wife!

762
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,963
I caught you trifling with my...

763
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:44,175
Thank you so much, Mr. Bromley.

764
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:46,135
Isn't that what you said your name was?

765
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:47,553
That's right.

766
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:50,681
Well, I'm quite sure you're safe now.

767
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:54,101
Couldn't you stay with me
just a little longer?

768
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:58,105
Only until my nerves settle down.

769
00:55:59,774 --> 00:56:01,275
Can I get you something?

770
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:03,944
I have a business appointment.

771
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,155
What kind of business appointment?

772
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:12,036
I'll bet you're a traveling salesman
or something exciting like that.

773
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:16,374
No, Madame. As a matter of fact,
I work for the United States government.

774
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:19,460
The government! Isn't that marvelous?

775
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:21,462
It must be fascinating work,

776
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:24,632
traveling around
from one big city to another.

777
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:28,135
Don't you ever get lonely?

778
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:30,888
No. I play checkers a lot.

779
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,307
I make friends quickly that way.

780
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:35,518
Would you like
just a little bit more brandy?

781
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:36,977
No, thank you.

782
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:41,148
Maybe... Maybe you'd like
to lie down and rest for a while.

783
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,983
No. I do have an appointment.

784
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,735
I must get to my hotel and check in.

785
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,154
- You can stay here!
- Here?

786
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:49,990
In your room?

787
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,992
I'd feel so much safer.

788
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,995
And then, after you've rested for a while,

789
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,207
and freshened up, if you like,

790
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,667
we could play checkers!

791
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:03,587
Or something.

792
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:06,882
Well...

793
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:10,886
I...

794
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:16,851
No... Really, I shouldn't.

795
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,480
Who could that be?

796
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:29,488
I caught you foolin' around...

797
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,366
- Me?
- Trifling around with my wife!

798
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:35,077
Don't move or I'll...

799
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,584
I guess I didn't do it so slick, huh?

800
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,169
But effective.

801
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:46,547
There. That does it.

802
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:50,384
Now, don't breathe too deeply.
You'll pop your collar button.

803
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:53,554
Don't worry, Mr. Bromley.
We won't break them.

804
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,181
Damn tie.

805
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:58,225
Don't know why a treasury man
has to wear a tie.

806
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:01,979
What men won't do for money
and other considerations.

807
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,068
Good luck.

808
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:09,320
Yeah.

809
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:18,370
Now, now, now.

810
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:21,582
Everything's going to be all right.

811
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:23,125
Here you are.

812
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:16,971
Thorston Bromley. Bureau of the Mints.

813
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:20,891
- We've been expecting you, Mr. Bromley.
- Thank you, sir.

814
00:59:20,975 --> 00:59:22,142
Briefcase.

815
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,980
Regulation 18-C.

816
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,065
And a very good regulation it is, sir.

817
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,614
Mr. Perkins.

818
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:46,375
Mr. Bromley, this is
the mint superintendent Mr. Perkins.

819
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:48,460
- Glad to know you, Perkins.
- Bromley.

820
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:51,005
- It is Thorston Bromley?
- Yes.

821
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:53,007
Were you with
the department in Philadelphia?

822
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,800
No.

823
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:57,303
Very nice building, Perkins.

824
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,346
- Very nice building.
- Thank you.

825
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:00,681
Shall we get started?

826
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:03,100
Yes. Yes. We'll take the elevator.

827
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:09,273
Bromley, you know, I could've sworn
there was a Thorston Bromley...

828
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:13,027
I have to get finished here, Perkins,
and get on to our mint in Carson City.

829
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:15,446
Yes. Of course.

830
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,531
We'll start with the second floor.

831
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:27,374
By the way, I don't suppose you were
ever in Washington three years...

832
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:30,544
I haven't been to Washington in five years.

833
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:34,423
Tell me, how often do you
get this elevator serviced?

834
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:35,758
Every month.

835
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:38,385
The rails need greasing.

836
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,556
Well...

837
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,227
To the right.

838
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:50,606
We'll start with the vault
in the security room.

839
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:52,399
That'll be fine.

840
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:03,243
That's the exit to the roof.

841
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,670
Open up, corporal.

842
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:14,254
May I see your weapon, please?

843
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:15,464
Thank you.

844
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:19,677
- How many shifts on your post, corporal?
- Only one, sir.

845
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:21,637
- What time do you start?
-8:00.

846
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,848
- What time do you finish?
- At 6:00, when the mint closes, sir.

847
01:01:25,099 --> 01:01:27,184
Very good. Sorry.

848
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,770
Your hammer spring needs tightening.

849
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,777
Take that gun to ordnance
first thing in the morning.

850
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:38,696
Yes, sir.

851
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,277
Mr. Bromley?

852
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:21,321
Yeah.

853
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,663
We're all ready to start minting that gold.

854
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:33,876
That is, as soon as you've
finished your inspection, of course.

855
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,336
That'll be fine.

856
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:45,304
Besides the smelting room,
the weights and measures

857
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:48,015
and the engraving room
are also down in the basement.

858
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,349
Very good.

859
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:03,530
<i>Mary McCarty loved whiskey and gin</i>

860
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,908
Did you say something?

861
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:07,910
No. Just singing.

862
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:13,207
Here we are, Mr. Bromley.

863
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,835
Of course, right now,
everything is at a standstill,

864
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:18,879
waiting for your go-ahead.

865
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:20,422
Yes, I understand.

866
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:28,931
These guards, you have
the personal histories on all of them?

867
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:32,226
Of course, Mr. Bromley.
That's standard procedure.

868
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,937
I've been with the Bureau
of the Mint for 17 years, and...

869
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,856
Just checking, Perkins. I'm just checking.

870
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:40,234
It's one of the pitfalls of my job.

871
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:42,736
You start mistrusting people.

872
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:45,072
- Yes, I...
- On the other hand...

873
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:48,534
That was my fault, Perkins.

874
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,494
I don't know how that happened.

875
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,579
Boys, would you give us a hand here?

876
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:53,747
I insist.

877
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:54,957
I'm sure it was my fault.

878
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,709
I insist. I tripped,
and I'm gonna have it fixed.

879
01:03:57,793 --> 01:04:02,297
- Really, Mr. Bromley, there's no need...
- Perkins, he's the Father of our Country.

880
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:07,094
We can't leave him with a broken nose.

881
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:09,304
Can we?

882
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:10,556
Of course not.

883
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,938
Right this way, gentlemen.

884
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,358
Right in here.

885
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:23,235
Easy does it.

886
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:04,795
- Melting pot about ready?
- Just about.

887
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:35,826
Make sure you get
that nose on straight, O.W.

888
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,745
For the Father of our Country,
I'll do my best.

889
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:48,922
- Well?
- They're meltin' the gold!

890
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:51,049
Meltin' the gold? What for?

891
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:53,427
All I know is I saw them melting it.

892
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:59,182
As soon as the mold hardens, we'll take
old George out and pour new George in.

893
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:11,945
Mr. Bromley?

894
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,119
Look what I brought you.

895
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,657
O.W., you're an artist.

896
01:07:57,741 --> 01:08:00,911
His only mistake
was not being born in Paris, France.

897
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:02,829
Gentlemen, it's nice...

898
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,665
...to be appreciated.

899
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:27,521
We'll wait until morning.
Let them finish whatever they're doing.

900
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:29,731
Then we'll decide how to handle it.

901
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,417
No...

902
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:57,384
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

903
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,302
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

904
01:08:59,386 --> 01:09:00,971
<i>Mary...</i>

905
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:07,018
Say, that is pretty, ain't it?

906
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:35,649
Git up.

907
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,075
Easy <i>as</i> picking cherries.

908
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:46,826
Go get us our wagon.

909
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,086
Hey, a little help here, please!

910
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:57,837
Give us a hand, will ya?

911
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:10,141
Easy does it, gentlemen.

912
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,601
Easy does it.

913
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:13,353
Very carefully, please.

914
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:16,523
All right.

915
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:52,434
This way.

916
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,146
Nice job, men.

917
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:03,403
Thank you.

918
01:12:03,445 --> 01:12:06,448
- Hello, Mr. Bromley.
- Hello, Perkins.

919
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:08,700
I brought your statue back
as good as new, I hope.

920
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,744
I'm sure it is. I appreciate your trouble.

921
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,330
- No trouble at all.
- Well!

922
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:14,914
Here we are.

923
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:18,126
Let's... Let's get
to those coin reports, shall we?

924
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:19,377
Yes, of course.

925
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:22,047
We should have everything
cleared up by tonight.

926
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:29,262
You're really getting to know
your way around here, Mr. Bromley.

927
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:51,284
Say, it's a shame the way the plumbing
goes to pot in these government buildings.

928
01:12:51,368 --> 01:12:52,535
Yup.

929
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:00,251
Hi, neighbor. It's all right, go right ahead.

930
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,968
Well, there they are, Mr. Bromley.

931
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:10,512
Waiting for you.

932
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:14,808
Now, if I can be of any assistance,
I'll be glad to stay around.

933
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:17,727
Or if you'd prefer to be by yourself,
whichever you wish.

934
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:21,898
Why don't you stay around a little while
until I have a better look at these ledgers.

935
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:29,883
Perkins?

936
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:35,054
I've got about four more hours
of work to do here.

937
01:14:39,017 --> 01:14:43,188
Well, I wonder if you'll be wanting me
to stay any longer, Mr. Bromley.

938
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:46,065
I must say, if all the mints
were run the way you run this one,

939
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:48,568
the bureau would be in excellent shape.

940
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:49,777
Thank you.

941
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:51,404
There's no need for you to stay.

942
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:52,739
Very good.

943
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,369
- Good night, Mr. Bromley.
- Good night, Perkins.

944
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:35,949
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

945
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:38,493
- Oh, Corporal?
- Sir?

946
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:40,245
What's going on in the lavatory?

947
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:43,039
I don't know, sir, but the workmen
seem to be taking care of it.

948
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:45,458
- Where are they?
- Must've gone home, sir.

949
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:47,752
Well...

950
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:25,123
Here's the key imprint
and the other things you asked for.

951
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:28,167
Get the duplicate made.
I'll meet you on the rotunda.

952
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,243
- Hank.
- Pete, how goes it?

953
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:46,704
Fine. Do me a favor,
next time you pass Henderson...

954
01:17:46,746 --> 01:17:50,375
Henderson's not on duty tonight.
He traded with McGuffey.

955
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,543
Have McGuffey bring me some coffee.

956
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:53,753
All right.

957
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:55,254
- Sugar?
- Yeah.

958
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:54,147
- Pete?
- Yeah?

959
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,815
McGuffey said to get your own coffee.

960
01:18:55,857 --> 01:18:58,276
- He did, did he?
- Yeah.

961
01:18:58,317 --> 01:18:59,986
What about the $4.00 I loaned him?

962
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:01,362
He didn't mention it to me.

963
01:19:07,994 --> 01:19:09,495
Did you hear something?

964
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:11,831
It's the plumbing. They're workin' on it.

965
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:15,835
Tie it off.

966
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:19,065
Hank, I'll get you a cup on my next round.

967
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:20,233
Thank you.

968
01:20:39,085 --> 01:20:40,670
You're relieved, Pete.

969
01:20:41,254 --> 01:20:42,296
Yeah.

970
01:20:42,964 --> 01:20:44,298
Thanks, Johnny.

971
01:21:21,127 --> 01:21:22,503
What's wrong?

972
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:26,090
Oh, nothing. I'm just not sleepy.

973
01:21:26,132 --> 01:21:28,634
That's good. Now go back to sleep.

974
01:21:49,447 --> 01:21:50,448
Hey, Pete...

975
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:52,742
- Here's your coffee.
- O.W.!

976
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:54,368
There wasn't any more sugar.

977
01:21:54,452 --> 01:21:57,038
Must be McGuffey. He uses
more sugar than any man I know.

978
01:21:57,496 --> 01:22:00,124
By the way, did you pass Joe
while you were on your round?

979
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:01,667
No. Why?

980
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:04,086
I wondered if he was using
the freight elevator.

981
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:06,547
- That's against the rules.
- I know.

982
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:09,425
- Well, Pete, enjoy your coffee.
- Thanks.

983
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,377
Here's your key, Sam.

984
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,628
See you later.

985
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:57,241
Seven...

986
01:23:59,118 --> 01:24:00,202
Nineteen...

987
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:11,964
Twenty-th...

988
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,801
No, that's not right. I'll start over.

989
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:20,514
Seven...

990
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:24,101
Back to nineteen...

991
01:24:30,483 --> 01:24:31,525
Seven...

992
01:24:37,448 --> 01:24:38,949
Twenty-fou r...

993
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:56,008
Joe?

994
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:59,386
- Did you use the elevator a while ago?
- No, why?

995
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:02,139
Nothing.

996
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,188
Seven...

997
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:41,053
- O.W.
- Yeah?

998
01:26:57,338 --> 01:26:59,423
I'm terribly sorry.

999
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:30,097
What's wrong? Can't you lie still?

1000
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:33,976
It's the plumbing.
Now, who ordered the plumbing fixed?

1001
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:37,104
- Whose plumbing?
- My plumbing.

1002
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:40,566
What do you mean? There's
nothing wrong with your plumbing.

1003
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:45,904
That's it! There is nothing wrong
with my plumbing.

1004
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:47,406
That's what's wrong!

1005
01:29:03,172 --> 01:29:04,298
Sorry.

1006
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:06,175
That wasn't plumbing.

1007
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,468
Maybe the boiler room.

1008
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:10,095
No, it sounded more
like the smelting room.

1009
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,616
Nothing down there,

1010
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:56,618
but Mac left the fire going in the forge.

1011
01:30:56,702 --> 01:30:59,746
- Didn't you put it out?
- I didn't know if I should.

1012
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:01,081
<i>I'll</i> do it.

1013
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:29,503
Honesty is the best policy.

1014
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:33,006
Stolen money burns a hole in your pocket.

1015
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,968
Yeah.

1016
01:33:14,923 --> 01:33:16,341
Outta the way!

1017
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:20,554
Hank, take a look at this.
I found it in the smelting room.

1018
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:23,890
All of the men
in the smelting room wear caps.

1019
01:33:24,016 --> 01:33:27,185
You know those plumbers who were 
here this afternoon, did anybody ever...

1020
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,355
Where the hell is George Washington?

1021
01:33:31,773 --> 01:33:32,941
We're being robbed!

1022
01:33:33,025 --> 01:33:36,403
Hank, you cover the basement!
Pete, you come with me!

1023
01:33:36,528 --> 01:33:38,488
Joe, sound the alarm!

1024
01:34:00,427 --> 01:34:01,887
Come on, boy.

1025
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:21,657
- Halt!
- Jump!

1026
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:22,908
Corporal of the Guard!

1027
01:35:03,532 --> 01:35:07,452
Mr. Perkins, this man claims
he's the treasury inspector.

1028
01:35:07,536 --> 01:35:09,705
Yes, that's right.
My name is Bromley, I came...

1029
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:13,291
Bromley? Did... Did you say Bromley?

1030
01:35:15,961 --> 01:35:18,463
This is the damndest gold I ever seen.

1031
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:30,100
<i>Mary McCarty
has gone up to heaven</i>

1032
01:35:30,142 --> 01:35:34,312
<i>She's mourned by her friends
at her untimely fate</i>

1033
01:35:34,396 --> 01:35:38,734
<i>She perished one night
in the arms of a lover</i>

1034
01:35:38,817 --> 01:35:41,987
<i>And passed from this world</i>

1035
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:43,989
<i>She was just 88</i>

1036
01:35:44,197 --> 01:35:46,491
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

1037
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:48,452
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

1038
01:35:48,994 --> 01:35:51,872
<i>Mary McCarty</i>

1039
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:54,624
<i>Loved whiskey and gin</i>

1040
01:35:59,129 --> 01:36:00,964
What's the name of the next town we hit?

1041
01:36:01,006 --> 01:36:04,092
Ludlow, Kansas.
