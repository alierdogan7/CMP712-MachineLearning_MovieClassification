1
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,833
Colt 45, single shot.

2
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,997
You had to cock it every time you shot.

3
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,830
It was called a peacemaker, but I haven't
seen much peace that it brought.

4
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,670
No, you guys today
have that full automatic.

5
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,030
Pull the trigger and spray.

6
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,752
History's a funny thing.

7
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,078
They said Columbus discovered America
and the Indians were already here.

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,875
That's like me telling you
that I discovered your car.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,949
They call them evil red savages because
they didn't give up the car soon enough.

10
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,150
One thing about time.

11
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,512
No matter how much or how little passes,
it changes things.

12
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,596
People forget their past.

13
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,349
They forget the truth.
But pictures don't lie.

14
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,318
Forgotten gunslingers like Nat Love,

15
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,159
Ison Dart, Cherokee Bill.

16
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,751
And troops too,
like the Ninth and the Tenth.

17
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,715
See, people forget that almost one
out of every three cowboys was black.

18
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,356
Cos when the slaves were freed,
a lot of them headed out west.

19
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,232
Built their own towns.

20
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,999
Shit. They didn't have much choice.

21
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,069
In fact, over half the original settlers
of Los Angeles were black.

22
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,556
But for some reason,
we never hear their stories.

23
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,912
Stories like Jessie Lee and his posse.

24
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,873
That was the gambler, Father Time.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,594
This here was crazy Little J.

26
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,115
The big man was Obobo.

27
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,310
He was Jessie's enforcer.

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,352
And then there was Weezie and Angel.

29
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,631
And then of course there was the leader.

30
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,478
Jessie Lee.

31
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,515
Yeah, man,
these cats was the original posse.

32
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,998
I'm gonna tell you...

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,556
It all started in the Spanish-American war,
on the front line.

34
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,035
(gunfire and shouting)

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,875
- Can it get worse?
- It's going to get worse.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,275
I can't take too much more!

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,234
Jessie, we're almost out of ammunition.
Jessie!

38
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,071
Goddammit, let me go!

39
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,239
Get them off of me, Jessie Lee!
They got a fucking Gatling gun out there!

40
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,954
- Obobo, stay calm.
- Retreat!

41
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,753
Look at me. I want you to stay calm.

42
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,348
I'm calm. All right.
All right. I'm calm.

43
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,551
Is that Jessie? Let him through, boys.

44
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,676
Jessie. Still alive.

45
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,157
I would expect nothing less.
I set my clock to you. Come in.

46
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,068
Jessie, they say you can tell
a lot about a man by his profile.

47
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,318
A certain strength of character,
or lack thereof.

48
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,830
Now, yours, it's scarred, isn't it?

49
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,520
It's very, very scarred.

50
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,031
No doubt you heard the call for retreat.
Awful word, isn't it? Terrible.

51
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,234
Don't you think a good soldier would
rather die than run? I know I would.

52
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,079
Yet now you come to me
with the bullets flying

53
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,078
and you want to know
where and how to run.

54
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,718
And the real question is
if I'm gonna let the Tenth Cavalry retreat

55
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,593
or if I'm gonna let them stay right here.

56
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,789
(man shouts)

57
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,514
- Weezie!
- Yes, Colonel Graham, sir.

58
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,631
- Go and get me that man.
- What man?

59
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,320
- From the stockade...
- Durning and Walker?

60
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,874
Jessie, you volunteer to stay behind.

61
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,957
(laughs)
I'm gonna have to raise you, Durning.

62
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,476
Raise me?

63
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,830
I reckon you got some good cards.

64
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,238
Or... you're bluffing.

65
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,713
I got the cards. I got the cards.

66
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,996
I'll call you anyway.

67
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,236
I got a full house. What you got?

68
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,512
- You damn snaggle-tooth!
- Damn shame we ain't playing for money.

69
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,914
Private Durning, sir?

70
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,952
Weezie, your nose is brown enough.
What do you want?

71
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,677
Oh, it's my pleasure to tell you the colonel
wants you and Walker to come with me.

72
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,713
How you like them apples?
Come on, let's see them feet.

73
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,119
All right, now. If the colonel says we
should get going, we'll be hoppin' along.

74
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,319
Thank you, Weezie.

75
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,797
Rewards and retributions.
Rewards and retributions.

76
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,036
Mr Walker!

77
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,151
Judging by your recent desertion,

78
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,238
would you say you no longer desire
to serve in this army?

79
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,839
Yes, sir.

80
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,316
Walker, you are discharged.

81
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,228
Go on. See you. Godspeed. Run!

82
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,670
Thank you. Turn profile, please.

83
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,075
Turn profile and hold it right there.

84
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,475
Thank you. Shoot him.

85
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,229
Come on, Jessie. Man's a coward,
says killing's against God.

86
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,989
You realise I'm giving you a chance
to shoot a white man?

87
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,076
Do it.

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,754
Do it. Do it or the Tenth stays right here.

89
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,351
Do it!

90
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,874
Rewards and retributions.

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,117
And Private Durning.

92
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,435
Durning, you're a gambling man.

93
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,155
Take your chances at 30 paces
or take command of the Tenth.

94
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,397
Jessie no longer desires the position.

95
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,558
I guess I'll take command of the Tenth, sir.

96
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,836
Smarter than he looks.

97
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,239
Durning, you and your soldier report
to my office at 2100 hours. Thank you.

98
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,075
- Retreat!
- We're pulling out!

99
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,630
Thank you, Weezie.

100
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,111
Jessie, did you know this man is the last
surviving member of the Motisa tribe?

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,390
Yes, the Motisa tribe. I'll show you.

102
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,793
- Mo tea, sir?
- I didn't hear you.

103
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,360
Mo tea, sir?

104
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,512
No, thank you. You boys come with me.

105
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,916
Jessie, you disappoint me.
You've never let me down before.

106
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,632
They had a Gatling gun.

107
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,116
- We were outnumbered, outmanned...
- And out of excuses.

108
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,912
What's on your mind?

109
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,918
There's a Spanish
supply convoy tomorrow.

110
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,600
For delicate reasons
we cannot attack it openly.

111
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,508
Due to my political aspirations,
a scandal would be unwise.

112
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,191
I'd like the Tenth to slip behind
enemy lines, eliminate the enemy,

113
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,235
take those supplies, and bring whatever
you find - guns, ammunition - back to me.

114
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,591
Behind enemy lines?
Why don't you use your golden boys?

115
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,234
This mission isn't suitable for their skills.

116
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,514
- Suppose we say no, sir?
- Suppose I tell you you disappoint me?

117
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,189
Neither of you are in a position
to decline this opportunity.

118
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,949
Durning, I can throw you in the stockade
forever and then some.

119
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,152
What of your sterling career, Jessie?

120
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,317
Tried to desert in Manila.
Assaulted an officer.

121
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,874
Three escape attempts here in Cuba.

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,390
That's a very poor record, isn't it?

123
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,231
Of course, due to sentence deferment for
military service, we end up with you here.

124
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,069
You were sentenced to hang
but ended up with life in the army.

125
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,953
I can strip you of that deferment
if you wish,

126
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,753
but that leaves you
standing at the gallows.

127
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,396
Either we go on your mission
or he gets life imprisonment and I'm dead.

128
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,159
If that's how you see it, so be it.

129
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,555
Weezie.

130
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,240
Civvies? I don't understand.

131
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,559
Let's just say for this mission
uniforms would be inappropriate.

132
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,436
Dismissed.

133
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,229
Evening, Jessie.

134
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,470
(Colonel) Weezie!

135
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,639
Jessie Lee, what did you do in the States
the colonel liked you so much?

136
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,314
- What the hell is this?
- What is that?

137
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,919
Damn! Who turned out the lights?

138
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,268
Just a little humour.

139
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,358
You have to admit I'm funny, ain't I?

140
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,072
After serious evaluation of this situation,
I figured we should go by the book.

141
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,237
We will go infantry first
and sharpshooters to follow.

142
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,798
Sharpshooters all dead except Jessie.
Infantry... we it. Ain't nobody else.

143
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,276
- Sounds like you're questioning orders.
- No, sir.

144
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,072
This is horseshit.

145
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,875
Maybe we should forget about infantry.
Maybe you should just attack.

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,834
They don't even know we're here.
And they got a lot of guns.

147
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,157
- That's bad.
- It makes no sense to wake them up.

148
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,638
We'll go in there and use our hands,
our knives, and no guns. You got it, sir?

149
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,309
- Sounds like a motherfucking plan to me.
- Let's do it.

150
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,600
Yanquis! Yanquis!

151
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,550
Guns, ammo, anything you can find.

152
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,272
De oro.

153
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,239
I ain't no "de oro".

154
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,874
Lookie what we got here.
Got a case of rifles here.

155
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,592
Jessie.

156
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,994
Jessie!

157
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,076
Come here, Jessie!

158
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,511
Look, Jessie!

159
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,470
- We in trouble.
- Jesus, Jessie!

160
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,879
We found a crate of gold, you don't like it.
I'm never gonna figure you, Jessie.

161
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,592
Pack it up. We gotta go.

162
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,633
Good morning, gentlemen.
Lost our way home, have we?

163
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,514
Out of uniform and AWOL
is no way to end a career, Jessie.

164
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,279
The record will show you all died heroes.

165
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,072
(soldiers laugh)

166
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,994
What about the gold?

167
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,513
Hm. I believe the answer
to that one is "What gold?"

168
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,514
Ha!

169
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,875
(gunshot)

170
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,270
Nice shot, Jessie!

171
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,192
Come on!

172
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,275
Get 'em, Jessie!

173
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,197
Shit! Ain't nothing wrong
with getting some free booty!

174
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,311
Yahoo!

175
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,238
- (Jessie) Put the gold in the saddlebags.
- This is amazing!

176
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,989
Just what we need,
an admiration society, Jessie Lee.

177
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,476
You never know, Graham may need
his little houseboy in hell.

178
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,875
(Weezie) Hold on. I'm on your side.

179
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,514
I saved your lives.
You should be thanking me.

180
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,679
- Save the bullet. I can get us out of here.
- You'll have more company soon.

181
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,518
- Out of where?
- Here. Cuba.

182
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,393
I can get you out tomorrow.
Leave everything to me.

183
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,751
Meet the boat that takes the dead bodies
back to the States.

184
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,393
Dead bodies?

185
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,990
Yes. They take them back to the States.

186
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,112
Every fortnight -
that's two weeks - I meet the boat.

187
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,792
You meet the boat, get on the boat
and you're home. Does that sound good?

188
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,313
Now, I'll need a sizeable amount of that
gold to make sure it all runs smoothly.

189
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,274
Jessie, we got to get up outta here.

190
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,595
Maybe not so sizeable.

191
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,234
One, two, three.

192
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,030
(explosions)

193
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,313
He got greedy
but I took care of everything.

194
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,432
Only the purser knows
you're going to be on board.

195
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,109
- Where's the money?
- I changed the gold into cash.

196
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,436
I want all the money.

197
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,198
You piece-of-shit weasel.

198
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,039
Wait. You can't just go
meandering out there.

199
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,072
The only live people on this ship
is the captain and me.

200
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,715
Which means everyone else
has to go as cargo.

201
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,831
Cargo?

202
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,516
- You mean dead cargo?
- Did I fail to mention that before?

203
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,632
No, you didn't mention that,
you crazy son of a bitch.

204
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,629
We ain't got much choice. Either way,
we're going out in one of these boxes.

205
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,231
The choice is if we go out alive
or like our friend Walker here.

206
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,955
- We're gonna do it.
- Hell, no, Jessie. I'd rather swim.

207
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,232
Are you telling me that this big, strong
country ox is claustrophobic?

208
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,873
I don't like tight spaces.

209
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,753
It's nice in here, Obobo.
Real comfortable.

210
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,031
- Can we get the hell outta here?
- Obobo, look here.

211
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,358
See this here? My daddy gave me
this book when I was young.

212
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,916
- I can't read.
- No. Look in the reflection.

213
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,192
He told me if I could see my reflection
in that book, I'd be safe.

214
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,834
- It's not working.
- You keep looking.

215
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,349
In an hour from now you'll be right there.

216
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,278
- It ain't working.
- It's gonna work, Obobo.

217
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,469
(groans)

218
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,671
Seems like
all this war brings home is corpses.

219
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,915
Just let it slip through
your fingers. You try.

220
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,796
That means you're doing it wrong.

221
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,912
"Nicodemus was a slave of African birth."

222
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,838
"He was bought for a bagful of gold."

223
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,396
"He was reckoned
a part of the salt of the earth,

224
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,876
but he died years ago, very old."

225
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,753
"Nicodemus was a prophet,
at least, he was wise,

226
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,519
for he told of battles to come."

227
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,350
"How we trembled with fear
as he turned up his eyes,

228
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,232
and we heeded the shake of his thumb."

229
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,079
"...bought for a bagful of gold."
Remember that.

230
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,953
"He was reckoned
a part of the salt of the earth,

231
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,719
but he died years ago, very old."

232
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,991
"Nicodemus was a prophet,
at least, he was wise,

233
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,509
for he told of battles to come."

234
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,315
"How we trembled with fear
when he rolled up his eyes,

235
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,398
and we heeded the shake of his thumb."

236
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,590
(cheering)

237
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,917
(? "One Night Of Freedom"
by B.B.O. T.I. (Badd Boyz of the Industry))

238
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,635
? God only knows what tomorrow brings

239
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,479
? All I need is one night of freedom

240
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,275
? Gotta let the fun take control of me

241
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,630
? Now it's time for us to come together

242
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,117
? I wish this night would last forever

243
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,309
Oh, yeah, baby!

244
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,069
I got paid. A couple of days ago the man
was gonna kill me, now he pays me.

245
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,796
Jessie Lee, this pocket change is for shit.
What about the rest of that there gold?

246
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,549
Spending will attract attention.
I'll give it to you in the morning.

247
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,150
- Hold on just one minute.
- I'll give it to you in the morning.

248
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,716
Can't I hang onto
a couple of them satchels of gold?

249
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,831
You know you can trust me.

250
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,396
I won't spend it until you give me
the word. Let me hang onto them.

251
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,875
In the morning.
Then I'm going out west.

252
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,151
- Where you going?
- I got some unfinished business.

253
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,909
Jessie, you can't do that. We're a posse.
All for one, one for all.

254
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,158
When did you last have a woman?
I know a couple with behinds like...

255
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,511
Jessie, I'm coming with you. Jessie...

256
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,870
- Obobo, listen.
- Let me come with you.

257
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,879
You deserve more than I got to offer.
Take this book. Take the book.

258
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,629
This is good luck.
I want you to hold onto it.

259
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,515
The next time I see you,
I want you to know how to read it. OK?

260
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,713
(whooping and cheering)

261
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,354
(singing)

262
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,552
Mm. Yeah!

263
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,633
(shouting and cheering)

264
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,716
Weezie, they're naked!

265
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,075
Oh, my God! Make me think I've been
in the wrong saddle all these years!

266
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,233
That's Abdul. Hey, Abdul! Beautiful!

267
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,193
You guys need me! This is the one I love.

268
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,709
Hello! Hey, sweetheart!

269
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,559
I told you guys you needed...

270
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,790
Weezie, you little sneaky boy!
You all right with me!

271
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,791
So these are your war hero troops,
Weezie?

272
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,799
Tell me, is he as good a commander
as he is a charmer?

273
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,317
Uh, yes, ma'am. You could say
he's a charming commander.

274
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,874
And mighty good to us too, ma'am.

275
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,198
So he tells us. Come on in
and show us that heavy artillery.

276
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,269
Don't fret. The only colour we care about
is the green of your dollars.

277
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,391
- Yes, ma'am.
- Just what you want.

278
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,311
- (woman shrieks)
- Ooh!

279
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,398
Excuse me, ma'am.
Did I hear you say green?

280
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,877
Yeah, honey. We got lots of green
upstairs. Just follow Big Kate.

281
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,149
We have a special guest tonight.
One of Colonel Graham's boys.

282
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,555
Evening. My name's Jimmy J Teeters.

283
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,470
My friends all call me Little J
on account of I was the youngest.

284
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,830
This is Dimples, Louisiana Slim,

285
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,554
Father Time and Jimmy Love.

286
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,114
Boys, this is a war hero, so take it easy.

287
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,153
Come on in. We like a man
who puts his money where his mouth is.

288
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,195
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Let me see if I got all these names right.

289
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,709
We got Louisiana Slim,

290
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,230
Dimples, Jimmy Love and Father Time.

291
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,749
How come they call you that?

292
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,158
We could sit here for eternity and a day
and nobody gonna beat Father Time.

293
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,874
- Ain't that right?
- That's right.

294
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,516
Isn't that something? We're gonna
have to see about that, ain't we, boys?

295
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,393
Put your money out there, Little J.

296
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,989
We fought our way up the San Juan Hill
and then fought our way down.

297
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,078
Then up.
They chased us down the other side.

298
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,799
Agh! Angel! It's a man!

299
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,673
Angel, let's get outta here!

300
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,998
What you oughta do is put that milk down
and get you some of that liquor,

301
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,750
and get one of these pretty things
before you end up with that ding-a-ling.

302
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,510
I haven't had a good hand yet.

303
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,952
Your hand looked low, red man,
but I'll take the deed to your teepee.

304
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,640
Try that and I'll scalp your black ass.

305
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,435
I don't know what kinda mojo
you got working on these cards,

306
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,835
but it sure is working.

307
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,633
The game is five-card stud, Mr Teeters.

308
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,389
I'm glad you're close, so I won't
have to reach out for your money.

309
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,080
(Louisiana Slim)
Let's go. Give me some cards.

310
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,918
Deal me in, Father Time.

311
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,637
It's natural progress.
Got to happen sooner or later.

312
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,754
Cutterstown folk won't let us have no land
- even reservation land - without a fight.

313
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,235
Better to wait forever than to fight.

314
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,354
When you start killing for a dream,
you usually end up killing the dream too.

315
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,950
That's what hell is,
watching your dreams die.

316
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,798
Your education will set you free.

317
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,148
(Little J laughs)

318
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,478
Triplet queens and the one-eyed jack,
boys. Blind as justice.

319
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,556
Ain't no justice at this table.

320
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,118
Sure there is, Jimmy Love,
just to you justice ain't been served.

321
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,711
Well, well, well. Looks like
Father Time ran out of time.

322
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,674
Lady Luck sure ain't with me.
Guess it's your deal.

323
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,836
With pleasure.

324
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,233
Go on, now, Time!
Go, go, go! Look out below!

325
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,558
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Your ass is mine! I'm coming through!

326
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,756
Obobo, I hate to say it,
but your friend Jessie is very strange.

327
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,793
He's weird. He don't talk much.
I never trust a man who don't talk much.

328
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,354
- Am I right, Angel? Am I right?
- Shit!

329
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,040
Let me tell you something about that boy.

330
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,958
I seen him shoot a man, put his gun away,

331
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,039
shoot another man three times,
walk out the door before he hits the floor!

332
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,993
That doesn't make a difference.
The man is weird.

333
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,237
We came all this way together
and then he just takes off.

334
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,636
He's got something twistin' in his mind.
I don't know what.

335
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,389
He'd ride to hell and back
and gun down the devil if it'd fix it.

336
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,910
Fix it? You wanna fix something?
Fix that bad eye of yours.

337
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,076
(shouts)

338
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,031
- Hey!
- He's talking about my eye!

339
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,116
- So what?
- He's talking about my eye!

340
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,879
You tough
when it comes to shooting a man.

341
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,030
But when it comes to shooting a woman
between the legs, it's another story!

342
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,630
This here's Father Time.
If anyone asks, you ain't seen us.

343
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,709
Give me some more of that gold
and I'll tell them I ain't seen you before.

344
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,638
Angel, who's that?

345
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,992
Candyman! You're looking
sharp as a mail catalogue on foot!

346
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,829
- Shining and gleaming and everything!
- Your breath stinks.

347
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,398
If your wife took more time to douche,
I might not have that problem.

348
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,876
Little J, Jessie left this for you.

349
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,036
Thank you, Obobo.

350
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,151
- Father Time?
- What's up?

351
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,956
You're pretty damn good with them cards.
Getting caught back there was stupid.

352
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,514
- Hazard of the occupation.
- Hazard?

353
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,835
A hazard you're lucky to live through.

354
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,918
Let me tell you a story.
I had a partner once named Silas.

355
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,474
Black man, like you. Could he cook!

356
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,318
- You cook?
- (grunts)

357
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,398
Me and Silas used to run a card game
back in Abilene

358
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,671
till one time old Silas got caught cheating.

359
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,349
Let me tell you,
they peeled his black ass like a grape.

360
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,916
Me, I figured the army
was a good way to let things cool off.

361
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,316
Spare my black ass the nostalgia, soldier.

362
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,193
That why you helped me?
You getting misty-eyed?

363
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,673
Oh, no, no, no.

364
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,839
As far as partners go,
I ain't so sure you'd make a good one.

365
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,397
I figure any man with your skill, getting
caught back there like that by fools,

366
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,829
he might need
some more schooling himself.

367
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,157
No, I got in it back there just for the fun.

368
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,716
See, I ain't much on people, Time.

369
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,912
Money's great. Booze is all right.

370
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,715
But for me, most of all, it's the thrill.

371
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,231
You know that thrill of knowing
you could win it all or lose it all

372
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,510
in the blink of an eye?

373
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,757
You sure is the kind
that would fart in the bathtub

374
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,440
and turn round and bite the bubble.

375
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,994
Maybe after you teach me a thing or two

376
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,908
we can try it again in, say, Texas.

377
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,600
See there? You're learning already.

378
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,280
I'd like to propose a toast.

379
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,716
(talking in next room)

380
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,959
To Texas.

381
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,356
(Angel) We're having so much fun!

382
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,632
Candyman, check it out. Little J.
I had this one little girl...

383
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,911
- Who in the fuck is you?
- I got no problem with you.

384
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,555
If you ain't got no troubles,
why don't you and that tired-ass Sioux

385
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,798
- get your troublesome ass out of here?
- Don't make me change my mind.

386
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,277
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

387
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,753
Piece of shit!
Take all of us to hell, then.

388
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,315
Weezie, you disappoint me.

389
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,757
Brigade!

390
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,199
- Weezie!
- Fire!

391
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,515
I can't dodge the bullets!
We've got to jump, Weezie.

392
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,598
You jump first. You're the longest.

393
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,918
Come on, Weezie! Jump!

394
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,509
Colonel Graham, sir? These men
took me hostage. It was awful, sir.

395
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,198
- Come on, Weezie!
- Shit!

396
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,240
(yells)

397
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,557
- Come on, Weezie! Come on!
- Where are you?

398
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,993
Go! Go! Go! Go!

399
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,633
Go!

400
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,233
- We gotta catch up the others. Hold on!
- (Weezie) I'm holding!

401
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,556
Obobo! Weezie!

402
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,917
- Reckon they give up?
- They ain't ever gonna give up.

403
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,952
- Look here, Little J.
- Damn!

404
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,874
- What are we gonna do, Little J?
- Hell if I know.

405
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,991
We'd best warn Jessie. Let's go.

406
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,636
(Weezie) I got to get me a fresh horse.

407
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,228
(Weezie) This makes no sense to me.
How long have we been going now?

408
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,909
None of this stuff was in
any of the books or magazines I read.

409
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,238
I'm riding like two grizzly bears
trying to fuck a racoon. My ass hurts.

410
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,476
Shut up before I really make it hurt.

411
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,875
Shit, ain't no percentage in this.

412
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,672
(gunshot)

413
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,031
(Obobo) Jessie?

414
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,118
It's gotta be. Jessie? That you?

415
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,355
- We got trouble.
- Jessie.

416
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,516
They killed Angel.

417
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,391
(Little J whoops)

418
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,877
Ain't this pretty, boys?
I tell you, I still cannot believe that shot

419
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,358
that Jessie knocked the colonel's
Motisa brain out of his eye socket with.

420
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,677
Can't wait to see his next portrait.
Right, Obobo?

421
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,155
- You said it.
- (Weezie) It's like I always said.

422
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,796
Nothing bonds men closer together
than having a common enemy.

423
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,674
With Colonel Graham and his brigade
on our asses and after that gold,

424
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,236
we are bonded together for life,
if you get my meaning.

425
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,237
How long is this life for?

426
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,194
These Spanish gold coins
are mighty pretty. Mighty rare too.

427
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,676
But if you spend them,
you'll leave a trail for that colonel.

428
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,713
- You trying to say I'm poor and I'm dead?
- Shit, yeah.

429
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,434
After I've finished my business out west,

430
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,599
I'm gonna go up to Canada and the
Dakota territories and let things cool off.

431
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,154
Y'all wanna ride with me, that's OK.

432
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,512
Don't ask no questions that need
answering. And don't get in my way.

433
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,428
- (Obobo) I'm with you, Jessie.
- (Weezie) I'm definitely with you.

434
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,915
(Little J) I've come this far, what the hell.

435
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,512
What about you, Mr Well-Dressed?
Why you wanna ride with outlaws?

436
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,839
I got a good feeling about you boys
and I always plays my hunches.

437
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,554
Everything's got its price.

438
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,638
Hell, a man's gotta give the devil his due.

439
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,795
I'm telling you, that stack of yours
works better with a partner.

440
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,993
Spreads the take around,
makes it less noticeable. It's perfect.

441
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,635
- How come you're with these boys?
- That's a long story.

442
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,593
You got time to tell me
why you take his orders?

443
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,678
Or why you wanna throw in with me?

444
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,037
Seems to me the only problem
the white man has with the coloured man

445
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,878
is that he's afraid.

446
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,992
You know how people are always afraid
of what they don't know

447
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,680
or what they don't understand?

448
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,760
Me, I ain't afraid of much.

449
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,870
Except boredom.

450
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,949
Believe you me, riding with Jessie Lee,
you ain't never gonna be bored.

451
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,719
Most people would notice
if we were partners.

452
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:02,551
No. It's the friend and the stranger scam.
I'm telling you, it is perfect.

453
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,595
(rustling)

454
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,911
Man can't find rest in his sleep.

455
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,558
Damn!

456
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,036
(animal growls)

457
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,395
Mama, who are those men?
They got guns.

458
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,238
Oh, my!

459
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,429
Hell we doing here?

460
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,315
I think I've found a way
to make this gold a little less hot.

461
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,508
Lookie here.

462
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,916
Melt 'em down into 20-ounce bars.
No questions asked.

463
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,713
Do a good job and I'll give you one.

464
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,675
My little friend here's gonna stick around,
make sure you do it right.

465
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,559
And there's just one more little
special thing I need you to do for me.

466
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,716
What's that?

467
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,757
- You done, smithy?
- As soon as this batch cools.

468
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,877
You make that special order he asked for?

469
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,757
I had to plate the cartridge,
but that slug's pure.

470
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,000
It's gonna make a nasty hole
in something, gold being so soft.

471
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,588
- I can't figure out...
- Just pack it up.

472
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,037
Come on, now, Obobo, give me a hand.

473
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,037
Father Time.

474
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,639
Sometimes it's important
to be able to trust a man, isn't it?

475
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,399
- I was just looking at this...
- No.

476
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,875
Not you. Him.

477
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,394
What's the odds we can trust him?

478
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,788
- Not good, I guess.
- No.

479
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,878
- You always play your hunches, right?
- Mm-hm.

480
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,709
(Little J and Obobo laughing)

481
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,637
- Go ahead and shoot him.
- Huh?

482
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,115
Go ahead and shoot him.

483
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,870
You're joking, right?

484
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,116
Call me out, huh?

485
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,471
OK.

486
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,316
Mister, I don't know you.

487
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,230
But when I get through with you,
won't nobody know you.

488
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,194
Wait a minute, mister.
I didn't do nothing to you.

489
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,869
- It's you!
- You shouldn't give a rat's ass who he is.

490
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,638
I'm gonna kill you.

491
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,075
You gonna shoot, shoot.

492
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,791
Save the bluffing for games.

493
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,118
- Jessie, you killed the blacksmith.
- We gotta get out of here.

494
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,912
Let's go!

495
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,555
I want you to take this little package
over to a man named...

496
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,877
When he shows up, give it to him.
It's real important. OK?

497
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,672
OK.

498
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,360
What the shit is going on?

499
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,511
Take off your hat when you talk to a lady.

500
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,759
- Crazy son of a bitch.
- (Little J) Watch that, now, Time.

501
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,676
See that bad man right there?
That's Father Time.

502
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,950
We the outlaw posse.

503
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,277
You run down there and tell the sheriff

504
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,597
that Father Time and the outlaw posse's
in a killing mood.

505
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,188
- Move.
- Jessie, what are you doing?

506
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,519
I said everything's got its price.

507
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,235
Now so will you. Just like the rest of us.

508
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,955
(Little J) You always play your hunches.
Ain't that right?

509
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,714
Hey, boy!

510
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,156
Hey, boy!

511
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,233
Afternoon, Watt.

512
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,551
Hey, Jessie,
you wouldn't shoot a lawman, would you?

513
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,233
Jessie, I'm unarmed. I'm unarmed.

514
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,193
Jessie, you wouldn't shoot. Please, Jessie.

515
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,349
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed...

516
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,156
(train whistle)

517
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,477
Jessie!

518
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,912
Jessie!

519
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,279
They were just here.

520
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,995
- Excuse me. Is yous Colonel Graham?
- Yes, darling, I am.

521
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:18,148
One of them left something.
Said to give it to Colonel Graham.

522
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,237
It has not been long.
We can still get them.

523
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,635
In time.

524
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,191
That crazy fool better know who he's
messing with. I ain't going to jail for him.

525
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,949
We all better know who
we're messing with. They're all killers.

526
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,117
The colonel likes
getting prisoners on military deferment.

527
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,196
Like Jessie. He was supposed to hang.

528
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:50,075
I don't know what demons Jessie has,
but I know he definitely has a past.

529
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,556
That's what the gold bullets are for.
Gold's timeless.

530
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,958
The hoodoo ladies in New Orleans
believe the only way to put demons to rest

531
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,513
is to kill them with gold.

532
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,108
Hold on! Y'all are talking craziness.

533
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,870
With 500 dollars on each of our heads, we
all got plenty of our own demons after us.

534
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,355
We have had pretty good luck up till now.

535
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,790
Maybe it's better if we go our own ways.
Split up.

536
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,789
You can split up if you want to. But if
anybody can get us there, Jessie can.

537
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,036
Dead or alive.

538
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,313
(plays haunting tune)

539
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,196

540
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,793
Stop!

541
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,276
Jessie, stop it.

542
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,360
Jessie Lee, we hereby sentence you
to life in the military.

? Let that hammer fall

545
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,233
? But I didn't get very far

546
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,715
? Let that hammer fall

547
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,711
? I was riding out with my gang

548
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,114
? Let that hammer fall

549
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,516
? Oh, I'm lucky that it wasn't a man

550
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,995
? Let that hammer fall

551
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,469

555
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,873
? See the big white man
on his big white horse...

556
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,155
Cutterstown. Look at that.
We're still a long way off.

557
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,714
Not if we go through Diablo Pass.

558
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,400
That's Sioux territory, Jessie.

559
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,229
We won't have help from soldiers
if we get into trouble.

560
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,072
The red man ain't got no problem
with the black man.

561
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,318
As for you, white boy,
that's a whole different story.

562
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,752
First you enslave the black man,
exploit the yellow man,

563
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,237
then you kill the red man so you can use
his land for railroads. Can I get a witness?

564
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:18,997
Amen!

565
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,035
If I may approach the bench, Your Honour,
I ain't never personally enslaved nobody,

566
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,879
so, Time, you can kiss my white ass.

567
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,676
If there was a train on these tracks
right now, we'd both be on it.

568
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,874
But I'd be gambling and you'd be
fetching my chips like a little houseboy.

569
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,958
You can't even cheat right.
Can I get a witness?

570
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,433
Amen!

571
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,836

- Let the Indians get him.

Let's move out.

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,436
Come on, Jessie, let's have some fun.

574
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,677
? Ain't no man can put a chain on me

575
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,758
? Let that hammer fall

576
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,475
? Oh, sometime I think about the red man

577
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,954
? With the feathers in his hair

578
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,675
? Took me in his home

579
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,314
? And together we grow grain

580
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,318
? He was my friend

581
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,073
? That old Indian...

582
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,436
(Obobo) I told you, Weezie.
Jessie Lee will show us the way.

583

- Don't fall in.

- I'm taking a piss.

592
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,637

- Jessie! Jessie!

593

Fuck this monotonous cowboy bullshit!

597
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,192
What is "monotonous"?

598
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,834
It means I can't take it no more.

599
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,748
- Shut up!
- We got company, Jessie.

600

I'm talking about revolution
without bullets.

601
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,794
Revolution without violence or bloodshed.

602
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,595
It's easier to shoot a gun
than it is to read a book.

603
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,919
It's easier to take a man's life than it is
to educate him and teach him about life.

604
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,033
It's easier to hate than it is to love.

The revolution I'm talking about

606
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,833
is a revolution of the mind and the spirit.

607
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,315
And education, that's the key.

Education leads to freedom.
Education is freedom.

609
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,557
Education will teach you
how to do it yourself

610
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,832
as opposed to asking
someone else to do it for you.

611
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,798
And around it...

612
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,353

Freemanville!

614
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,515
And a dream like Freemanville,
it's worth it.

615
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,719
You want education? How's this?

- We're not. Mount up.

Cutterstown. We'll be there to greet him.

a good idea with the colonel on our tails?

622
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,951
We's only gonna stay one night. The rest
of you boys can decide for yourselves.

623
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,355
It sounds like a right good idea.

00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,635
That's right. You touch Lana,
I'll throw your black ass in jail.

665
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,393
Yeah, that's right, I'm the sheriff.
How about you, partner?

666
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,671
- You running from the army?
- I reckon you could say that.

667
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,268
- You're running from the law.
- It depends whose law.

668
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,837
The law they got for them
or the law they got for us?

669
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:37,432
You ain't changed, boy, but the world has.
Ain't that black and white no more.

670
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,120
Soon the west is going to be settled.

671
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,596
Ain't gonna be no more
new frontier or frontiersmen.

672
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,792
It's gonna be about business
and businessmen.

673
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,990
See? Listen. There, now, Jessie.

674
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,396
Once all the land is full up...
Listen to me.

675
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,832
Once it's full up, the only thing
that can change is who's got the land.

676
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,077
- The only colours will be rich and poor.
- Carver.

677
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:04,716
Carver, you talks more shit
than a phonograph record.

678
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:09,436
Jessie, you ain't here
for all that revenge shit, are you?

679
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,718
I tell you what.

680
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,355
Let's be two old friends having a drink.

681
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,075
See? No past, no future.

682
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,517
Just this drink, right here, right now.

683
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,757
Here's to here and now.

684
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,915
This here's a good Indian.
He does nice work on my office.

685
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,031
I believe in this town's future.

686
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:50,154
That Indian lady, she had a fair trial.
Now she's gonna hang for trespassing.

687
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,635
To that woman,
fences are just steel wire.

688
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:57,914
She doesn't understand her people don't
own that property. She can't hang for that.

689
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,156
You remind me of the people of this town.

690
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,670
They all want a Thanksgiving turkey
but won't wring its neck.

691
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:08,430
They hire me to get my hands bloody.
I keep the turkeys in a coop.

692
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,199
When one of 'em gets loose,
I wring its neck.

693
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,710
If you'll excuse me, I've got work to do.

694
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:19,277
Hi, honey. Hello, baby.
Come on. Go watch the hanging.

695
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,916
What are you doing here in daylight?

696
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,508
- Jessie's back.
- What?

697
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:30,475
Jessie Lee's in Freemanville.
Don't ask me how, but he is. I swear.

698
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,755
Good people of Cutterstown,

699
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:38,192
welcome to this demonstration of justice.

700
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:42,313
God watches over all of us and shows us
the right way - to obey the laws.

701
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,956
And have the moral strength
to punish them that don't,

702
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,036
even if it seems cruel.

703
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,720
Without laws, we got anarchy!

704
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:56,311
And then we all revert to savages.

705
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,956
- ? The Lord knows
- ? He sees what we do

706
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,197
- ? Punish the savages
- ? And heathens too

707
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,788
What do we got here, Alex?

708
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,755
I can't take it no more, Carver. The KKK
come around here in them white sheets.

709
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,317
One said he'd take my wife next time.
That's why I left Alabama.

710
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,829
There ain't no place for us
in this here country.

711
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:28,195
I know this bishop named Turner. He's
taking folks back to Africa and we going.

712
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,117
You sure?

713
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,629
I'm sure.

714
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:40,072
I'll buy... I mean, the Land Office will buy
your deed and sell it to some poor folk.

715
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:45,228
Seeing as you ain't gonna have
any use for it if you're leaving.

716
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,789
Sure mighty nice of you, Carver.

717
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,912
Boy, what you doing stealing my apples?
I've a good mind to...

718
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,837
Oh, what the hell. Go on, take it.
Get on outta here. Behave, now.

719
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:24,031
- Ain't that King David's son?
- Reverend say he got the devil in him.

720
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,835
Well, anyway... My!
What we gonna do about your hair, child?

721
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:56,874
Getting a little sloppy, Jessie.
Don't you remember nothing I taught you?

722
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,278
I'm gonna use all of it, old man.
You still carving and carrying on?

723
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,472
- What are these ones here?
- Ku Klux Klan's heads.

724
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,479
- Let's shoot a couple for old times' sake.
- It's kinda big for targets.

725
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,592
Not if you shoot 'em in the nuts like I do.

726
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,636
Papa Joe, I didn't come out here
to be shooting guns right now.

727
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,069
Lana got your nose open, ain't she, boy?

728
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,829
Don't bullshit me. I was your age.
You ain't never been mine.

729
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,157
She's my daughter,
but she's a woman first.

730
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,875
I hear you come into town
with some roughnecks and a cracker.

731
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,072
- You got any money?
- I tell you what.

732
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,474
You leave me alone with your daughter,
you got plenty money.

733
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,712
Deal.

734
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,793
One more thing.

735
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:55,153
He's running "friend and a stranger".
The stranger's called Father Time.

736
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,954
Sunday school face,
Saturday night figure.

737
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:09,914
You boys mind if I put these
weary old feet under your table?

738
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,793
(? "Tell Me" by Vesta)

739
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:20,831
? I wanna know, pretty baby

740
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,239
? Tell me

741
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:28,591
? If the loving is strong

742
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:37,913
? Tell me if the loving is strong

743
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:44,189
? Tell me that you love me again...

744
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,359
A lot of things have changed. They got
a new law, the Grandfather Clause.

745
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,395
If your grandaddy was a slave and didn't
have a vote, you don't. Nothing but hopes.

746
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,752
Now we got the KKK coming in
trying to destroy even that.

747
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,839
Jessie, you come into town
gunning for Sheriff Bates,

748
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:07,273
you're gonna be the one
to destroy your daddy's dream for sure.

749
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,234
Good book says turn the other cheek.

750
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,272
Your daddy was a preacher.
You should know that.

751
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,676
Ain't the good book or any other book
I got problems with.

752
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,268
It's how folks interpret it.

753
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,473
As far as I can see, good book got
a lot of coloured people on their knees

754
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,353
praying for pie in the sky.

755
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:31,268
Sheriff Bates
is gonna get whatever he's gonna get.

756
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,550
You still angry.

757
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,352
Jessie...

758
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,356
you never wrote.

759
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,115
I thought you was dead.

760
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,630
So did I.

761
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,639
Maybe it was for the best.

762
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,513
Carver's asked me to marry him.

763
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,070
Do you love him?

764
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,713
You know, maybe...

765
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,593
Maybe you deserve more than...

766
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,480
than I got to give, lady.

767
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:34,595
- You don't want me to touch you, I won't.
- I don't, so don't.

768
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,634
Bye, Jessie Lee.

769
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:52,029
? Tell me that you want me again

770
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,835
? Ooh, ooh

771
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,873
Why you been staring at me
all night, big man?

772
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,913
I never heard a woman
sing pretty as a bird before, ma'am.

773
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,350
What's that in your pocket, music lover?

774
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,835
Shucks, ma'am. It's nothing but my harp.

775
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,315
Play for me. Go ahead.

776
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,879
Better yet, why don't you play on these?

777
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,831
(giggling)

778
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,750
Go ahead! Get! Play on it.
Get, get, get, get, get!

779
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,628
(whooping)

780
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,549
(man) Freedom!

781
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,238
I came to apologise.

782
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,432
You OK?

783
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,078
Hey.

784
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,556
Come with me.

785
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,598
You remember this when we were kids?

786
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,792
You remember this?

787
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,398
(laughs)

788
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,398
Woman, you crazy!

789
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,752
(screams)

790
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,469
You know what your problem is?
You think about death too much.

791
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:48,878
You need to start thinking
about what's still alive.

792
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,953
(laughter)

793
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:56,914
Looks like you boys are outta money.
You have to pay to see these.

794
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,952
Hold on there, Papa Joe.

795
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,674
I... am in.

796
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,392
I sure hopes you work on credit.

797
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,233
You know how to cheat Mr Death?

798
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,270
By making love. Cos every time
you make love, you can make another life.

799
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:15,039
And that makes Mr Death mad as hell.

800
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,108
(cheering)

801
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,959
Hi, honey. He's an animal, girl!

802
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,236
Evening, gentlemen.

803
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:06,670
Sorry to bother you, but certain matters
have come to my attention.

804
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:12,113
Seems that we have some undesirable
elements in our society, like him.

805
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,070
And... like him.

806
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,952
Do it.

807
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,158
My, my, you do stick out in this crowd.

808
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:28,114
Sheriff, you can't just come in
and drag people out of here.

809
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:34,472
I'm gonna ask you nice, just once.

810
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,110
- Where's Jessie Lee?
- I don't know what you talking about.

811
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,192
All right, let's see who's next.

812
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,118
Hey, boy.

813
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,196
You hear me, boy?

814
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,479
You telling me you risk a beating
to protect that outlaw?

815
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,990
He'll bring trouble
to this pretty little coloured town.

816
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,398
Don't touch my woman!

817
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,350
Where is he?

818
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,070
Weezie ain't never done nothing.

819
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:42,508
Son, you are about to learn
a very valuable lesson.

820
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,072
(groaning and screaming)

821
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,516
(bell ringing)

822
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,114
We got him good, huh?

823
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,875
He asked for it.

824
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:26,517
What in hell are you looking at?
You ain't seen nothing.

825
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:30,358
Get back inside!

826
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,072
You heard me!

827
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:35,749
- Bates! Bates!
- Carver, they got Papa Joe!

828
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,630
What the hell you think you're doing?
You let that man go.

829
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,273
Ain't no darky gonna give me orders. Ever!

830
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,393
Do it, Carver.

831
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,718
Do it.

832
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,558
Do it.

833
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:05,197
I'm coming back tomorrow with more
men and more guns than you ever seen.

834
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:08,118
And I want Jessie Lee right here.

835
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,390
Right here!

836
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,715
Dead or alive.

837
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:19,789
And as for those other two - Papa Joe and
that boy - don't worry about them none.

838
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,277
They're gonna get a fair trial.
Just like Jessie Lee.

839
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,950
- Hey, hey!
- Give me that! Eli!

840
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,593
Settle down.

841
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,075
Get those ladies inside!

842
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,432
Let's break it up! Break it up.

843
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,514
Move!

844
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:02,074
He tried to save me. That's the first time
anybody tried to save me.

845
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:07,194
Ain't no profit in trying to save nobody.
You only end up...

846
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,276
You only end up dead.

847
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,513
Jessie, don't you go and do nothing crazy.

848
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,553
- This here's a peaceful town.
- This here ain't peaceful.

849
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,036
Partner, nobody wanted this to happen.

850
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:40,712
It happened, and you the lawman, so you
better think about what you want to do.

851
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,955
Yeah.

852
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,594
(Lana) Where's Daddy? Daddy!

853
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,915
Lana. Lana.

854
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,276
Sheriff Bates done gone
and took your daddy to Cutterstown

855
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,437
for one of his so-called fair trials.

856
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,552
Jessie.

857
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:24,393
You know Papa Joe and the other man
won't get no fair trial.

858
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,557
KKK gonna be on 'em before sunrise.

859
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,834
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Pipe down.

860
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,713
You boys will get a fair trial
as God is my witness.

861
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,958
Is that the same God that witnessed you
putting black folks into slavery

862
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,469
and stealing Indians' land?

863
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,239
You ought to be working on
saving your black soul.

864
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,318
Shit. I'm working on saving my black ass.

865
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:24,911
You boys don't worry.
You'll get your fair trial or my name ain't...

866
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,678
- My name...
- Shut up, Tom.

867
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,678
Right. Thank you, Mayor. Tom.

868
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,318
You boys back off.

869
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,715
I can't let you vigilantes come in here

870
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,674
and take these free negroville citizens
and do what you got to do.

871
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,917
For God's sake,
stand up for yourself, Tom!

872
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,713
I'm sorry, Mayor, but they got guns.

873
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,076
Jessie. The real white sheets is coming.

874
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,399
Let's get outta here.

875
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,629
Jessie Lee was here.
He left. He took them with him.

876
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:35,510
Shit fire! You've just shot the mayor!

877
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,392
No, Errol.

878
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,875
Jessie Lee just shot the mayor.

879
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,471
I think the wonderful citizens of
Cutterstown will want me as the new one.

880
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,635
Who are you?

881
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,514
Won't the townspeople be surprised
by the demise of their mayor?

882
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,153
What do you want?

883
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:55,910
There's no need for animosity.
Any friend of Jessie's is a friend of mine.

884
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,278
- Jessie, are they still following us?
- Hell, yeah. It's like white on rice.

885
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,632
Once the sheriff gets a head of steam up,
he's like a locomotive on a track.

886
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,150
- What did you say?
- I said he's like a locomotive.

887
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,553
Jessie, what is it?

888
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,591
Railroad.

889
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,075
You son of a bitch.

890
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:31,158
Boys, this is where
we're gonna part company.

891
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,955
What? What are you saying? You know
what happens when we split up.

892
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:39,949
- After all we've done, we are a posse.
- Jessie, them deputies killed Little J.

893
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:45,074
Obobo, I've been fighting over
what's dead for a long time.

894
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,873
It's time I start fighting for what's alive.

895
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,753
You know, Jessie Lee,

896
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:56,432
besides the fact of you having
something against me keeping my hat on,

897
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,516
I always figured you for an OK guy.

898
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,518
I even thought at the end of this
there'd be some gold.

899
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,710
I reckon I was wrong.

900
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,116
But one thing I do know
is there ain't no profit in dying.

901
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:12,075
If you go back, you face certain death
from that sheriff or that colonel.

902
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:17,752
Whichever one it may be, these town
people won't be here when you need 'em.

903
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,634
(Obobo) What if he's right, Jessie?
We shouldn't split up.

904
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,237
(angry shouting)

905
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:41,274
I know you're angry.

906
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:45,234
You're ready to destroy, ain't you?
Take matters into your own hands.

907
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:49,956
That's anger talking. The only thing
anger ever did was tear things down.

908
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:54,312
- People, we done built something here.
- That's right.

909
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,034
Something good.
Something that's ours.

910
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:02,757
But we know Sheriff Bates. You think he's
gonna think twice about burning all this?

911
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,678
Jessie should give himself up,
turn himself in.

912
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:09,918
Cos we have been keeping the peace
and nothing like this happened before.

913
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,998
That white man, he was not one of us.

914
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:17,193
- No, but Papa Joe is.
- Papa Joe? Hey.

915
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,519
Can I ask y'all a question?

916
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:28,588
If Bates can ride up into this town,
beat a man to death and get away with it,

917
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,631
what does that mean he can do to you?

918
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:34,514
We all know what this is really about.
This is about King David.

919
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:40,670
We loved King David, but he is dead. This
is between you and Sheriff Bates, not us.

920
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,395
Jessie Lee
ain't what Bates wants no more.

921
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,637
What he wants is your town.

922
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:52,834
Because he knows the iron railroad
is coming through Freemanville,

923
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:59,035
and whoever owns this property
when the railroad comes is gonna be rich.

924
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,355
Right over on Diablo Plains

925
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:06,110
they pushing the red man off his land
to make way for that iron railroad.

926
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:09,915
The same thing they did to that red man,
they gonna do to you.

927
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,190
Jessie's right. I've been through it.

928
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:16,154
Why do you think Bates is fixing up
his office like that and carrying on?

929
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,989
He got big plans for Cutterstown.
They want this land.

930
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:24,238
And the only way y'all is gonna keep
this land is to stand up and fight.

931
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,874
No justice, no peace!

932
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,958
(angry shouting)

933
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:34,551
You talking about a black KK raid
on a white town?

934
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,193
That's crazy.

935
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,675
They ain't soldiers. We ain't in Cuba.

936
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:43,954
I do believe this boy done got sunstroke.
He about to start a damn war.

937
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:47,868
Even if we wanted to,
we ain't got enough guns for that.

938
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,879
- Jessie. I'm with them on this.
- All right.

939
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,437
I'm gonna leave.
Y'all think you can sit safe.

940
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,872
You think that railroad's gonna
take a nice little turn and miss this town.

941
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,230
I seen my daddy's dream come true.

942
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,955
I'm done.
But I'm gonna guarantee you something.

943
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:11,870
The next time I come back to this town,
ain't gonna be one black face here

944
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,788
unless he's polishing shoes
at Bates's railroad station.

945
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,912
(shouting and arguing)

946
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,159
(man) Jessie.

947
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,035
Now, boy, you know me.

948
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:54,233
You know I ain't never asked nobody
for nothing. But now we need you.

949
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,750
We found out the sheriff
is going to attack us tomorrow noon

950
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,440
and he's blaming you
for killing the mayor.

951
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:05,429
You was right and we was wrong. But we
got no time to kiss your fuzzy behind.

952
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:09,235
(Papa Joe) Once upon a time you came
and begged me to teach you how to fight.

953
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,319
Now you gotta teach us how to fight,
so we can defend ourselves.

954
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:18,753
After what you said, me and Papa Joe
broke into his strongbox.

955
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,317
Found a whole mess of blueprints.
This here's one of 'em.

956
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:27,270
That's a railroad station
in the middle of this "Bates Town".

957
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:30,517
If you ask me,
it looks a lot like Freemanville.

958
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:34,394
That goddamn Bates
gonna wipe us right off the map.

959
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,637
I done bought myself out of slavery.
Twice.

960
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:43,072
That's my inn down there.
I'm gonna fight.

961
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:47,432
You're talking right, Jessie.
I'm gonna fight too.

962
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,312
Jessie Lee!

963
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,832
Jessie Lee!

964
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,914
Jessie Lee, you should have stayed gone.

965
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,589
Between me and you, Bates.
Nobody needs to get hurt.

966
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,956
- Why don't you let the town be?
- Jessie Lee, Jessie Lee.

967
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,640
You ain't looking at the big picture.

968
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,718
But then, neither did your daddy.

969
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,029
Like father, like son.

970
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,311
You ain't gonna hide
behind that badge today, Sheriff.

971
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:10,637
I guarantee, Freemanville burn,
Cutterstown gonna burn too.

972
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,553
He's bluffing!

973
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,796
We gonna start with
that nice little office of yours.

974
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,469
Why don't you ask your hard-working man
Two Bears up there?

975
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,795
You know he don't bluff.

976
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,680
That was your office! He wasn't bluffing!

977
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,634
Shut up!
Jessie Lee, you're a dead man!

978
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,673
Here they comes, boys.

979
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,555
Dismount!

980
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,831
- You got it?
- Last one.

981
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,512
Can't we all get along?

982
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,153
Hot damn!

983
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:58,191
I'll cover.

984
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,149
(gunshot)

985
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:16,151
Go, Jessie!

986
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,591
Man the Gatling gun!

987
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,593
Move!

988
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,992
Deserter!

989
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:28,069
(Obobo) Jessie! Jessie!

990
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,429
Jessie!

991
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,276
Cover me.

992
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,952
Shit!

993
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:57,995
You bitch!

994
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,358
You saved my life!

995
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:23,430
Yeah, but I should have saved mine and
kept riding. Cos Lady Luck ain't with me.

996
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,835
There won't be no town when this is over.

997
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,714
Damn the town! It don't matter.
I still got the deeds.

998
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:36,150
Town or not, the land's worth something
when the rail comes.

999
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,518
- I got a wife and kids. I'm outta here.
- Hey!

1000
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,835
Look, Jessie didn't kill the mayor.

1001
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,951
Bates did. I was there.

1002
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:48,072
I'm getting outta here.

1003
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,948
- Carver?
- Lana.

1004
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,670
I thought about what Jessie said.

1005
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:04,432
Whoever owns this land will be rich
by selling to Bates or the railroad.

1006
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,677
All the deeds are in your name.
You insisted on that.

1007
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,349
Baby girl, there's a lot going on here
you don't understand.

1008
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:13,550
So I see.

1009
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:18,037
Lana, white folks in this country
got the power. We gonna lose this town.

1010
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,516
Why shouldn't one of us
turn a profit in the process?

1011
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:24,029
Woman, why can't you see?

1012
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,474
It's for us, Lana. For you and me.

1013
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:32,515
I'm sick of watching you trying to teach
them poor raggedy kids how to read.

1014
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,676
Listen.

1015
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,712
I know you was with Jessie last night.

1016
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:44,234
I know how this looks and I know you
confused about a whole lot of things, but...

1017
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:48,717
you gotta trust me...
cos I love you, you see.

1018
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,115
Now I can finally do for you like I want.

1019
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:55,438
- Carver, let go of me, please.
- Baby, I can't do that.

1020
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:00,588
Sideburns blocking your hearing, boy?
She said let her go.

1021
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,990
Kids! Goddammit!

1022
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,632
(screaming)

1023
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,955
Get out of here now!

1024
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:43,993
Counting up the goodies?
As I recall, our deal was 50/50...

1025
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:46,839
Our deal didn't say a thing
about last night.

1026
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,793
Or about blowing Freemanville to hell.

1027
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:54,994
Sorry I hit you. But as for the town, you
mustn't fret it. It was a dead man's dream.

1028
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,588
Sooner or later, people gotta wake up.

1029
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:00,553
King David and Jessie dreamed too much.

1030
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:04,229
Jessie don't understand
about straight business. I do.

1031
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,874
Why don't you teach me?

1032
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:13,029
Go ahead, Jessie. Kill him.

1033
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,674
Very clever, Jessie Lee.

1034
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,949
Come on out.

1035
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:02,036
We all got to go to hell someday.

1036
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,758
When you get there,
tell 'em Jessie Lee sent you.

1037
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,436
I wouldn't be too hasty.

1038
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,269
Put your gun away,
go get my gold and come on over.

1039
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,878
Hurry up. Things could get hot.

1040
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,431
Jessie Lee, so good of you to come.

1041
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,393
You got the gold.
Why don't you let the lady go?

1042
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,910
Right, I've got my reward.

1043
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,316
But there's a question...

1044
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,590
of retribution.

1045
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:07,474
You know... an eye for an eye.

1046
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,475
She's got such lovely eyes.

1047
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,910
This is between you and me, Graham.
Let the girl go.

1048
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:22,076
Wrong! That's where you're wrong!

1049
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:26,432
You're in no position to question
my strategic command!

1050
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:30,917
Your strategic command was a joke.

1051
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,560
Even old walrus here knew that.

1052
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,955
Now you talk about being a coward.

1053
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,389
You're shooting at an unarmed woman.

1054
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,557
You told me once
you could tell a man by his profile.

1055
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:47,435
See, your profile look like
you from the Mo Scar Sir tribe.

1056
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:55,071
No.

1057
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:58,434
(click)

1058
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,358
She's such a lucky girl.

1059
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,598
You're too late, Jessie.
The place is gonna blow.

1060
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:51,195
(Bates) Come on, Jessie Lee!

1061
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:34,234
(Lana) Jessie, it's gonna explode!

1062
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:36,316
Jessie! Jessie!

1063
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:56,438
(Lana coughs and splutters)

1064
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:19,672
Jessie, your good luck book
stopped the bullet.

1065
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:23,236
Jessie, the book's not hurt.
No way. Not inside.

1066
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:28,150
Don't you worry about that, big brother.
You're gonna be just fine.

1067
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:32,834
(mouths)

1068
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,071
What about the town?

1069
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:45,469
Obobo, with all the gold we got, we could
rebuild Freemanville better than ever.

1070
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:49,318
And that's what we're gonna do.

1071
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,352
Read to me, Jess.

1072
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,749
(Obobo coughs)

1073
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:01,678
OK, listen.

1074
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:05,270
"Nicodemus was a slave of African birth."

1075
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,756
"He was bought for a bagful of gold."

1076
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,599
"He was reckoned
a part of the salt of the earth,

1077
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:14,473
but he died years ago, very old."

1078
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,517
That sounds so pretty, Jess.

1079
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,153
Say right there.

1080
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:25,751
"Nicodemus was a prophet,
at least, he was wise,

1081
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:28,075
for he told of battles to come."

1082
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,556
"How we trembled with fear
when he rolled up his eyes,

1083
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,558
and we heeded the shake of his thumb."

1084
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:37,319
"Good time coming. Good time coming."

1085
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,955
"Long, long time on the way."

1086
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:47,349
"Run, tell Elijah to hurry up Pomp

1087
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:52,076
to meet us under the cottonwood tree..."

1088
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:59,356
"...cottonwood tree in the Great Solomon
Valley at the first break of day."

1091
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:09,193
So, you were the kid?

1092
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:14,118
Thank you very much, sir.

1093
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,629
I think we got it.

1094
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,551
Hey!

1095
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,113
Not everything.
