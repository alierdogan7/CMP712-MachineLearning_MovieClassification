1
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:38,335
They call me Trinity

2
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:38,133
Bring beans faster.

3
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:53,462
If you have money, I give
a plate of beans.

4
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:26,879
Enough.

5
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:33,649
Not hungry.

6
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:42,485
A and A...

7
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:49,424
Leave it here.

8
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:04,293
- Is there a fugitive
- We'll find it somehow.

9
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:48,025
Relax, Chico, so
I live know more..

10
00:05:48,174 --> 00:05:49,954
At least until tomorrow.

11
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:33,837
Is there a way to find out...

12
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,840
You're starving.

13
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,009
After so umblãturã over
fields get starving.

14
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:57,098
So you have something and conscience?

15
00:06:57,508 --> 00:06:59,268
Yes.

16
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:04,834
And what have you on the conscience?

17
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:10,422
Look at him, he's super dirty.

18
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:30,306
Lucky you.

19
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:49,995
Just relax, Max, May
resident must're 12 hours.

20
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:53,470
I'll be dead useful.

21
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:58,106
I'll stand by tomorrow.

22
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:05,283
- I imagine you dangle the morning.
- Like a puppet.

23
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:11,142
Stay quiet, you're not hurting you.

24
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:24,413
You all humans, right?

25
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:29,651
Stay quiet, Max.

26
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:40,801
Vamos, hombre, on the road.

27
00:08:41,143 --> 00:08:45,023
- What?
- Top.

28
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:51,557
Minimum on someone and it
who wants to die

29
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,017
is a cross with his name on it.

30
00:08:54,363 --> 00:08:59,043
- So, what's your name?
- I say Trinity.

31
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:02,485
Trinity...?

32
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,278
- He's..
- Right hand of the devil!

33
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,858
On the road!

34
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:17,297
- How much I owe you?
- None.

35
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:20,918
- It's on the house.
- Thank you.

36
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:25,239
However, the bean was not just good.

37
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:30,184
Trinity?

38
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:34,082
They say you're the fastest gun.

39
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:37,404
- It says that...
- Yes.

40
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:41,107
So!

41
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,953
So Chico, say what happened.

42
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:01,897
A gringo wanted to
sleep with my wife, señor...

43
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:06,261
...

44
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:12,501
But when I looked in his eyes
black were milled and then crashed.

45
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:15,685
I think I hit my head.

46
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:19,023
- Sure.
- Yes, and I think that, señor.

47
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,038
- And saw someone else?
- No, just me.

48
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:23,480
Think about it!

49
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:27,018
- You want to tell my wife and knife
- And I...!

50
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:30,606
This gringo wanted to
sleep with my wife.

51
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:34,592
Yes, and you hit him with a very small knife.

52
00:10:34,997 --> 00:10:36,436
Yes, señor.

53
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:36,423
Get out and leave me alone.

54
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:40,524
- Left when I finished.
- You want scandal.

55
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:44,660
- I job much.
- And us.

56
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:51,928
- Then it's only one solution, Mel.
- Yes, the hardest.

57
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:58,747
Please leave.

58
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,787
- And sheriff
- gone.

59
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:10,241
Tomorrow at dawn you give
the way our friend.

60
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,150
We climbed into the bed of a woman.
She did not want to.

61
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:17,467
He left.

62
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,480
Should be judged.

63
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:24,447
The judge's wife fell into place.

64
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:27,847
And it would have remained there if
the man would not come.

65
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:31,065
- It was bound.
- Your friend chose the wrong bed.

66
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:37,034
The law is the law and even if you do not
understand, it must be respected.

67
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:41,766
You have one minute to exit the city.

68
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:45,992
This is your last warning.
Release him our friend.

69
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:21,483
Guys, it seems to be
to choose a new sheriff.

70
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:02,729
- Hey, you...

71
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:04,788
Yes, Paduchiosu.

72
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:06,948
I think he refers to them.

73
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:09,114
Drop sheath.

74
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:29,942
Now it's your turn, sheriff.
Drop it.

75
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:42,887
They'll die before I managed to retire EASC.

76
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:54,162
- What did I say?
- Madre mia, who is he?

77
00:14:56,737 --> 00:14:59,616
The left hand of the devil.

78
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:18,847
- Who
- A fugitive.

79
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:21,893
Blame always falls on Mexicans.

80
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:26,738
- What and tell
- Self Defense.

81
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:30,661
- Send him home.
- I was nobody here.

82
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:33,378
Only this gringo.

83
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,129
- He wanted...

84
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:40,120
He wanted to sleep with my wife, señor.

85
00:15:45,782 --> 00:15:47,901
You.

86
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,469
Ugly wound.

87
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:54,346
Lucky for him that the bullet did not hit the artery.

88
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,197
Help me less.

89
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,859
- Anaesthesia.
- Yes, señor.

90
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:27,612
- It was a great knife
- No, very small.

91
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,379
Still a înghiþiturã?

92
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:58,184
- How's Mom?
- Always something bad happens.

93
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:03,978
- Where the hell...?
- In New Orleans, is a brothel.

94
00:17:04,352 --> 00:17:07,031
Speak of the bullet.

95
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,069
Here it

96
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:23,092
Put your finger inside.

97
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:49,106
You're always gringos
" nis hiijos the Putas."

98
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:52,132
Want to our e culcaþi with the.

99
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,598
A good idea...

100
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:01,556
Sleep easy.

101
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:10,210
Tomorrow you can take him to
you to his beloved wife.

102
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:19,277
- Yet quickly retreat...
- Yes, thank you for"help".

103
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:24,991
- There were only three.
- Yes, this time.

104
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:29,811
But many more will come
in this town dirty.

105
00:18:30,223 --> 00:18:35,182
Better to disappear before
the brothers" gunmen" to come.

106
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:40,841
- I do not want any trouble.
- Have you been involved in and something else?

107
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:55,390
This smells burnt.

108
00:18:58,456 --> 00:19:02,095
- Who is he?
- My brother.

109
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:07,219
It's just in passing.
Leaving tomorrow.

110
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:11,032
So he smelled when he came.

111
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:14,704
I had three pieces
soap- up to clean it.

112
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:17,657
Would you shake hands with me,
you must first wash.

113
00:19:17,977 --> 00:19:20,775
I do not want tetanus.

114
00:19:23,313 --> 00:19:25,072
What does that mean?

115
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,560
- How'd you like that?
- I was tracked.

116
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:33,904
The one who holds the sheriff badge?

117
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:42,567
Two days after I escaped
from prison in Yuma...

118
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:46,476
...

119
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:50,754
He does not follow me,
have just the same way with me.

120
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,290
I never knew that, so that I shot.

121
00:19:53,674 --> 00:19:58,673
Later I learned that he had to
replace the sheriff who had been shot.

122
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:03,215
He had sheriff badge in his pocket.
I took place.

123
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,439
- To me the wait people.
Go to California.

124
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:11,932
I plan to give it a break,
but to us you're starter.

125
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:15,355
I do not know how, but
to make sure.

126
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:18,294
This is not a prison but a crapper.

127
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:22,415
Reminds me of beats in the bar,
when you were gone.

128
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:25,702
Officers have beaten two peasants.

129
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:29,320
I am now able to eat only gray and

130
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:33,147
that those officers are lathe to the floor.

131
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:35,429
They were armed?

132
00:20:36,087 --> 00:20:39,727
Peasants are certainly not
armed, and Sheriff.

133
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:44,729
Let us get your take a bath
before becoming a pig.

134
00:20:47,015 --> 00:20:49,614
Wash and tomorrow you're gone.

135
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:53,493
- See you.
- No, see you later!

136
00:20:54,062 --> 00:20:57,143
- You're really brothers?
- Yes.

137
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:02,365
We have the same mother.

138
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:29,182
I have seen so much dirt from
when Pecci flew by.

139
00:21:32,346 --> 00:21:34,467
This is the last time!

140
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:37,286
It should be a great chaos in the city?

141
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:39,803
Are you thinking of course the people officers.

142
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:43,584
They break peasants hands and feet.

143
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:47,381
But peasants back.

144
00:21:47,737 --> 00:21:51,137
- Why not fight?
- It's against their faith.

145
00:21:52,574 --> 00:21:55,453
These people are freaks east.

146
00:21:55,786 --> 00:22:01,186
They do nothing but pray and
to work, to pray and to work...

147
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:08,837
- What will my brother?
- None.

148
00:22:09,172 --> 00:22:13,212
I've never seen a
sheriff so unlucky.

149
00:22:13,594 --> 00:22:17,793
When something happens, there are
elsewhere and vice versa.

150
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:20,781
Always been unlucky.

151
00:22:24,646 --> 00:22:30,645
If I knew that you take your zdrenþele
stuff, Did not I would have given the last soap.

152
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:34,070
- Good, And Sheriff.
- Shut up.

153
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:37,802
- What about him?
- As always.

154
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:40,836
- People the officer?
- Yes.

155
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,170
Farewell...
I want to go to bed.

156
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:51,101
We do not review, so as luck.

157
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:59,695
Officer, I start to get tired of your hooligans.

158
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:05,348
Let alone give the peasants,
either get the guns.

159
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:10,965
- Why did you do that?
- Yes, why not?

160
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:26,997
Be understanding, and Sheriff.

161
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:31,966
Cowboys who work hard have
need little fun Sunday.

162
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:35,412
Like peasants beat
deprived of defense?

163
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:41,429
Peasants must induce different
i become too lazy

164
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:45,961
That's normal.
Did not know?

165
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:51,022
Mind your own business and let me do it
and my people alone.

166
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:58,538
All right.

167
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:02,188
What did you say?

168
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,406
Hoth bumps.

169
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:13,165
There is only one way to act.

170
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,627
And to tell you frankly, I do not like.

171
00:24:27,214 --> 00:24:29,294
Guys, listen.

172
00:24:33,512 --> 00:24:37,112
What's wrong with you Jeff.

173
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:48,002
And sheriff starts to annoy me.

174
00:24:48,776 --> 00:24:52,736
It's a bit stupid to understand the
what it takes us this town

175
00:24:53,114 --> 00:24:55,635
So you must learn it through
the hardest way.

176
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:59,353
They work hard but
the officer does not care.

177
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:03,106
Wants to have around
valley for horses.

178
00:25:03,457 --> 00:25:06,056
Forget it, you're not ª sheriff..

179
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,619
I know...

180
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:11,556
If the army comes cause much clutter.

181
00:25:11,923 --> 00:25:15,203
Before my boys to reach.

182
00:25:16,176 --> 00:25:20,215
- He must win.
- Why?

183
00:25:21,848 --> 00:25:26,608
Outside the valley is the most beautiful and
and horses that I've seen.

184
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:28,981
Nemarcaþi.

185
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:34,714
If you ban the peasants of the valley and
and bring their horses who will care?

186
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:38,475
- That's helpful.
- Officer...?

187
00:25:38,864 --> 00:25:40,463
Peasants.

188
00:25:41,617 --> 00:25:44,097
It's easier said than done.

189
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:50,496
No one in town will not
the officer against people.

190
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:54,085
And I will not succeed this alone.

191
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:02,068
No, no.

192
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:04,184
Yes...!

193
00:26:05,472 --> 00:26:06,672
There...!

194
00:26:06,973 --> 00:26:09,693
- For a dollar a day?
- No.

195
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:13,376
And ammo..?

196
00:26:13,812 --> 00:26:16,691
And accommodation and meals...?

197
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:21,784
And you're going to persuade the old man Jonathan
keep you.

198
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:26,580
An understanding...?

199
00:26:28,158 --> 00:26:29,278
No.

200
00:26:30,745 --> 00:26:36,024
Yes get your carcass aside and let me alone.

201
00:27:00,731 --> 00:27:06,250
It seems they want to so eze here.

202
00:27:06,694 --> 00:27:09,734
We can make them change their minds.

203
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:13,311
Show them how to
builds a house cool.

204
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:16,779
Does not look...

205
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:21,800
We must work and play games
later.

206
00:27:50,524 --> 00:27:53,124
- Welcome, Major.
- I welcome?

207
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:57,167
- We do not lie.
- Just hide the truth.

208
00:27:57,533 --> 00:28:01,973
If so miraculously disappear
in front of your eyes...

209
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:05,769
did not suffer at all.

210
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:08,401
We do not want such a miracle.

211
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:12,348
Only a sense of our poverty.

212
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:15,671
There is nothing more irritating
than a hypocrite.

213
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:19,408
I've come here with Caruth
with zdrenþe and much hope.

214
00:28:19,803 --> 00:28:21,602
A lot of faith, Major.

215
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:27,487
And after a few months they emerged
by chance he supposes and your brothers.

216
00:28:28,936 --> 00:28:34,456
And then" faith" can build
a house to fit within an army...

217
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,099
Fold and fill with cheese.

218
00:28:38,445 --> 00:28:43,324
That must be a
worthy poverty and profitable.

219
00:28:43,824 --> 00:28:49,524
- God has Dacian wild cows.
- And that you fast then you have marked.

220
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:54,545
While I and my horses hit
feet of rocks...

221
00:28:54,918 --> 00:28:58,837
your cows gain weight and so i
and that will be multiplied.

222
00:28:59,256 --> 00:29:02,255
All we want is a piece of
land where we can live.

223
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:06,791
This" piece" is on
12000 tons of earth, my friend.

224
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:10,140
Only a small part.
's Enough for all.

225
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,957
Leave vo and three horses to graze here.
We have nothing against.

226
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:18,512
No...

227
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:24,576
Get your things, people, gutters,
cows and get out of my valley.

228
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:28,993
- We traveled 3000 km.
- You can still do 3000 km longer.

229
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:32,769
- We have children...
- I hate children.

230
00:29:33,077 --> 00:29:36,877
I tried to speak to the
highest simþãminte yours.

231
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:41,128
But I have to remind you that
we came first in the valley.

232
00:29:44,797 --> 00:29:48,557
I believe that God said:

233
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:53,086
The last shall be first.

234
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,710
- And so why hurry?
- It's bad to be cynical.

235
00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:01,261
- E practical.
- May God forgive you.

236
00:30:01,604 --> 00:30:05,683
I hope, but do not think this would happen.

237
00:30:12,155 --> 00:30:14,675
Let this be a reminder, old man.

238
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:18,952
Whether you leave the valley or bury you here.

239
00:30:19,412 --> 00:30:22,093
You can choose one.

240
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,802
Get out, guys.

241
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,740
At work, guys.

242
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:48,191
Wait!

243
00:30:54,944 --> 00:30:57,703
- What's this?
- Mezcal and his band.

244
00:30:58,071 --> 00:31:00,431
For stealing from us from time to time.

245
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,620
Very interesting.

246
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,029
- Welcome, brother.
- Thank you, brother.

247
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:30,582
Quiet...!

248
00:31:30,894 --> 00:31:35,413
You forget that you are guest.
Nod brother Tobias.

249
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:40,319
- Gracias.

250
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:44,295
Yes the poor brothers some food.

251
00:32:04,426 --> 00:32:08,225
- Does not taste.
- There else.

252
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:13,435
You did it to not share with anyone.
Lie...

253
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:17,547
Quiet!

254
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:23,932
Next time I want soup
garlic and mucho vino.

255
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,357
Vamos.

256
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,938
You know what would be said idiot Older
if it were us?

257
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:47,541
God works in mysterious ways.

258
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,339
And that's for sheriff.

259
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:37,569
- By the way, where is he?
- He left town on horseback.

260
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:56,945
I told your brother that you left today?

261
00:33:57,277 --> 00:33:59,957
Day not finished yet.

262
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:08,793
I bet something will happen
in town now that he's not here?

263
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:15,030
I talk to you.
Bet?

264
00:34:31,432 --> 00:34:34,433
I told you not to get lost?

265
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:36,971
We need those things.

266
00:34:37,314 --> 00:34:40,194
- Out!
- Wait.

267
00:34:40,483 --> 00:34:42,442

268

I'll pay for it the day judecãþii.

00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:49,135
Good.
Stay treziþi.

270
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:53,769
Go home to the stables with cows.
Lost!

271
00:35:13,263 --> 00:35:16,783
- We have a new sheriff.
- Watch.

272
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,859
- How?
- Ask the officer.

273
00:35:20,144 --> 00:35:24,704
Officer Harrison wants to Us

274
00:35:25,065 --> 00:35:28,265
- That's not fair.
- No.

275
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,570
Be right back.

00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:34,385
- Who is he?
- Does ª sheriff badge.

277
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,440
Turns out.

278
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,731
Give him what he asked for.

279
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:44,757
- You're kidding me, right?
- No.

280

This is not a gonna like the officer.

282
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:38,778
What was the officer?

283
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:01,441
Hey, you.

284
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:34,573
Thanks

285
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:39,659
- We have an extra guy.
- No, we have an additional officer.

286
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:46,019
It would be good if you could tell people
Thy let the peasants to stay.

287
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:51,779
It's nice that against
Steps to people either.

288
00:38:52,172 --> 00:38:55,411
If you proceed, vo and three people will suffer.

289
00:38:55,716 --> 00:38:58,316
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

290

All in 2 hours!

292
00:39:15,526 --> 00:39:19,086
- You asked me to help you.
- Not so, narrow minds.

293
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,610
You should have see her eyes.

294
00:39:24,451 --> 00:39:28,530
- Looks like two frightened elves.
- Two elves frightened.

295
00:39:28,954 --> 00:39:32,314
Sure prostitutes hunting customers.

296
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:38,466
- Where are you going?
- The elves.

297
00:39:38,797 --> 00:39:42,837
No, you come home with me, do you

- Thanks, and Sheriff.
- Thank you and I.

299
00:39:45,554 --> 00:39:47,834
It was a peaceful town before you came.

300
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:51,535
- Disgusting but peaceful.
- I know that.

301
00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:56,211
What will happen to his captives?
'll Be hanged or release?

302
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:59,083
I do not want to work for them.

303
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:03,279
Release them all

304
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,910
- Bambino...
- Do not tell me Bambino!

305
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,958
And let me tell sheriff?

306
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:12,321

- Can not you give out of town.

308
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,719
- It's best to get out the door softly i
- What do you mean?

309
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:28,722
You're not the sheriff but horse thief
and not even a good one.

310
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,418
Not so hard!

311
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,269
- So what?
- I remain.

312
00:40:39,144 --> 00:40:44,823
And this to me
one dollar a day and food.

313
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:51,760
- This is blackmail.
- Yeah, that's

314
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:58,136
Okay but if you do a lot of noise
will be good to go.

315
00:41:01,248 --> 00:41:04,647
Sheriff Deputy and sleeping in the office.

316
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:08,567
- Hey, You Sheriff.

- Where are you going?
- At the bar to get a drink.

320
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:30,861
- And to think that...
- Come with me and I'll make one hell.

321
00:41:31,275 --> 00:41:34,434
- Only one...
- More than looks.

322
00:41:39,115 --> 00:41:44,074
Deputy Sheriff and remain on mats

323
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:48,534
I shoot you on this,
son of a bitch old.

324
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:52,193
Forget it, it's faster than a snake.

325
00:41:52,503 --> 00:41:58,401
I do not think that's so, but
your friend tells you: let him.

326
00:42:08,684 --> 00:42:10,644
Let us come out.

327
00:42:50,431 --> 00:42:52,550
No there's no fighting tonight.

328
00:43:13,326 --> 00:43:17,286
- That I liked.
- What you said about my brother?

329
00:43:17,705 --> 00:43:20,305
You want to start fights.

Fear of you...?

333
00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:46,518
You have more humor than sense.

334
00:43:53,113 --> 00:43:55,752
And Sheriff...!
Wake up.

335
00:43:56,576 --> 00:43:58,856

I just woke up,
So I'll take your part.

357
00:46:12,949 --> 00:46:15,549
That was not so clever, my friend.

358
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:55,281
Can I go to bed or you have other plans?

359
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:58,130
I came to drink.

360
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:03,260
I have to leave to tell my mother...

361
00:47:03,577 --> 00:47:05,217
That's right

362
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:09,138
Yeah, so she's not old at all.

Do you have other plans?
Steal cows, deliver burglary...

00:47:17,674 --> 00:47:23,072
Play cards...

365
00:47:23,555 --> 00:47:26,794
I'm too busy doing nothing.

366
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:02,698
- Who are they?
- Peasants that officer wants to displace.

367
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:07,846
- Why are no guns?
- That's their religion.

368
00:48:08,262 --> 00:48:11,981
They do not believe in violence...
something.

369
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:17,231
- How do we incurred officer
- They pray and get in return kicks.

- Not me.

372
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:34,689
- Lord sent you.
- I came only in passing.

our sisters Sarah og Judith.

377
00:49:14,656 --> 00:49:17,616
They were innocent, you're
Surrounded by evil.

378
00:49:17,993 --> 00:49:20,832
But the Lord heard his prayer
yours and sent you on.

379
00:49:21,246 --> 00:49:23,366
That's right

380
00:49:24,665 --> 00:49:28,625
It's quiet here...

381
00:49:29,043 --> 00:49:33,803
That's why it is not allowed
the officer to dirty place.

382
00:49:34,343 --> 00:49:36,582
True.

383
00:49:36,926 --> 00:49:39,325

New depleted our table?

384
00:49:40,137 --> 00:49:42,978

386
00:50:21,967 --> 00:50:26,566
The Lord's table is without
no symbols violence.

387
00:50:29,849 --> 00:50:32,728
Do not let them away from you.

388
00:50:34,229 --> 00:50:35,589
Let us pray.

389
00:50:43,278 --> 00:50:44,358

We were passing and I said:

399
00:52:36,883 --> 00:52:40,923
Why not go visit my brother Tobias.

400
00:52:42,137 --> 00:52:44,297
- You want to duplicate...
- No.

401
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:49,800

402
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:55,750
- You are always well comers.
- Yes, we will come.

403
00:53:02,071 --> 00:53:05,270
Why do not you remember me

404
00:53:05,659 --> 00:53:10,098
You know brother Tobias not
like guns on the table.

405
00:53:10,537 --> 00:53:14,497
- Now you know.
- Knife?

406
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:22,583
- Bring the wine.
- Yes, señor.

407
00:53:22,923 --> 00:53:27,683
Quiet!

408
00:53:28,262 --> 00:53:31,463
I said wine, not water.
Where's the wine...?

409
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:34,530
- Excuse me, brother...
- Where's the wine?

410
00:53:35,603 --> 00:53:37,602
Where's the wine...?

411
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,739
Put them in a row.

412
00:53:48,114 --> 00:53:50,074
Not you, you idiot.

413
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:03,111
I will drink no wine, no...?

414
00:54:06,048 --> 00:54:10,207
I do not drink wine, but
you what you like,...

415
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,980
- Wait, brother...
- You're not my brother.

416
00:54:20,977 --> 00:54:24,016
- He likes it here probably...
- and the other side.

417
00:54:28,067 --> 00:54:31,146
How dare you to give in one
of my brothers?

418
00:54:31,653 --> 00:54:34,892
- Did Ask forgiveness
- forgive me.

419
00:54:35,283 --> 00:54:37,082
Where are you going?

420
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:39,689
Come and get your cheek...!

421
00:54:54,383 --> 00:54:57,103
I have not seen before
...

422
00:54:57,928 --> 00:55:01,046
A and A...

423
00:55:37,922 --> 00:55:39,442
Fish Love it!

424
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,270
I...?

425
00:55:58,733 --> 00:56:01,533
Would not it be better to go?

426
00:56:04,822 --> 00:56:08,981
Dude, I tried to tell you that
my our guests disagree.

427
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:14,007
They take an eye for an eye and the law
tooth for tooth seriously.

428
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:17,574
Forgive them even more and come another time.

429
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:30,904
Jur: Mezcal not forget.

430
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,788
I and I.

431
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:54,303
- Brother Tobias, I was so scared.
- They left really?

432
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:01,598
Now you can and you're doing yourself.

433
00:57:01,957 --> 00:57:04,676
A bullet in the forehead
Mezcal and fish change their mind.

434
00:57:05,043 --> 00:57:08,764
God is the one who gives and takes life.
Our weapons are faith and love.

435
00:57:09,215 --> 00:57:11,455
Well said, brother Tobias.

436
00:57:11,757 --> 00:57:14,357
Only love can defeat evil.

437
00:57:14,677 --> 00:57:15,918
Says in the Bible.

438
00:57:16,221 --> 00:57:19,421

My lips will say only words
to praise our Lord.

441
00:57:28,149 --> 00:57:32,508
- Thus spoke.
- And is so right.

442
00:57:33,902 --> 00:57:36,902
- Your Guns, brothers.
- And your hat, Brother.

443
00:57:37,281 --> 00:57:39,441
- If you need me...
- For us!

444
00:57:39,826 --> 00:57:43,506
If you need us,
you know where to find us.

445
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:58,169
Not move up!

446
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,518
God is with us.

447
00:58:35,502 --> 00:58:38,581
- Good night, Jonathan.
- Go to hell!

448
00:58:39,006 --> 00:58:42,326
"He's leaving tomorrow,
He's just in passing."

449
00:58:42,763 --> 00:58:48,482
He will remain throughout life...

450
00:58:49,137 --> 00:58:53,136
What city ugly...
What horrible people!

451
00:58:54,121 --> 00:58:58,440
We should and shooting a bullet in the head.

452
00:58:59,438 --> 00:59:01,357
Here it

453
00:59:01,676 --> 00:59:04,076
Mexicans are too drunk to
to be able to stand.

454
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:08,261
I was sick, so I I
gave a little whiskey.

455
00:59:08,727 --> 00:59:12,246
- Nice of you.
- That I and I.

456
00:59:12,696 --> 00:59:16,335
- But I'm always wrong esc.
- Oh, shut up.

457
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:23,746
Yes, yes, I eat everything!
It may last your table.

458
00:59:25,486 --> 00:59:27,566
Why is that?

459
00:59:28,991 --> 00:59:33,791
I saw two new guys in town
...

460
00:59:34,986 --> 00:59:38,305
Everybody knew not promise anything good.

461
00:59:43,429 --> 00:59:46,308
- What?
- To greet the newcomers.

462
00:59:46,722 --> 00:59:48,721
I hope you doing not fight?

463
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:54,902
- I hate people sigh of relief.
- Let this and stay here with me!

464
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:18,599
What would people do without horses?

465
01:00:18,897 --> 01:00:22,937
Great Caesar, Alexander the Great...

466
01:00:23,275 --> 01:00:26,156
Great men of Spain...

467
01:00:27,572 --> 01:00:31,132
It would have been great without horses?

468
01:00:35,141 --> 01:00:40,339
What would have been formed nation
so without this noble animal...?

469
01:00:40,662 --> 01:00:44,942
This debt could be paid
better than by giving them...

470
01:00:45,285 --> 01:00:50,044
're green meadows where graze and
to grow in peace?

471
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,278
So I want that valley to
be mine at any cost.

472
01:00:56,453 --> 01:01:00,972
And if you convince them
the peasants to leave...

473
01:01:01,323 --> 01:01:05,922
I will reward you with a large amount o
allows you to Withdraw.

474
01:01:06,272 --> 01:01:10,192
- Valley is already you, officer.
- Good.

475
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:15,569
But first you need to make busy
to ª sheriff and the deputy sheriff.

476
01:01:15,927 --> 01:01:18,927
They disturb us the most.

477
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:24,080
- Can You very well appoint a new sheriff.
- I'll do that.

478
01:01:26,238 --> 01:01:28,438
A glass of sherry?

479
01:01:30,247 --> 01:01:32,246
It's coming...

480
01:01:32,537 --> 01:01:35,696
No thank you, officer.
Do you work.

481
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:41,790
That's what I call service to have your take seriously.

482
01:01:44,605 --> 01:01:48,325
Watch the deputy sheriff.
's Very fast.

483
01:01:49,514 --> 01:01:54,394
You heard Mortimer...?
ª Sheriff's Deputy rapidly.

484
01:02:46,067 --> 01:02:48,707
- Where are you going?
- To see the surroundings.

485
01:02:49,009 --> 01:02:54,168
It's one day quiet Tita...

486
01:04:09,852 --> 01:04:12,811
Therein lies the
quick vice sheriff, Mortimer.

487
01:04:33,901 --> 01:04:37,301
Can I help you with something and vice Sheriff?

488
01:04:48,573 --> 01:04:51,772
Are you interested in something in particular...?

489
01:04:52,155 --> 01:04:54,635
Yes.

490
01:05:05,242 --> 01:05:08,762
- What about the horses?
- No time.

491
01:05:09,162 --> 01:05:11,881
He said 10 seconds.

492
01:05:45,087 --> 01:05:49,486
You had nothing to do with this, right?

493
01:05:51,297 --> 01:05:55,697
And Sheriff, the city was peaceful
before coming madness.

494
01:05:56,132 --> 01:05:58,851
He can not shoot and hit that
the citizens of our...

495
01:05:59,215 --> 01:06:01,695
you just because you
give the sheriff badge.

496
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:06,009
I want you and the sheriff deputy
to give your resignation.

497
01:06:06,427 --> 01:06:10,466
Otherwise you will have to talk to
my friend the governor.

498
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:18,044
We can not let them get away out of this.

499
01:06:22,848 --> 01:06:25,568
Cursed be the day you were born.

500
01:06:25,932 --> 01:06:29,573
You're worse than pure evil.

501
01:06:33,433 --> 01:06:36,113
What to do with Mexicans?

502
01:06:36,475 --> 01:06:40,674
- Get them out.
- It can not stand.

503
01:06:41,144 --> 01:06:45,704
Give him whiskey and Make him sleep.

504
01:06:52,564 --> 01:06:55,804
- Issues...
- Nothing special.

505
01:06:56,191 --> 01:06:58,710
We put a bounty on my head.

506
01:06:59,024 --> 01:07:03,503
The new sheriff And I took the badge
not dead, leaving just lame.

507
01:07:03,901 --> 01:07:06,661
And follow me now.

508
01:07:07,026 --> 01:07:10,745
And now I ask for help...
that I may find myself.

509
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:20,690
$ 200...?

510
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:25,889
Are you thinking to denounce
on your own brother?

511
01:07:27,114 --> 01:07:30,395
This is an insult...
Not for $ 200 prãpãdiþi.

512
01:07:33,909 --> 01:07:37,589
- Come with me?
- Where?

513
01:07:42,493 --> 01:07:46,052
You rely on the fact that I never
that I will not shoot, do not you?

514
01:07:46,455 --> 01:07:47,854
No.

515
01:07:48,788 --> 01:07:52,947
Why do not you ever teach?
Go home mother in New Orleans.

516
01:07:53,373 --> 01:07:57,612
Take with you a few girls
the Mothers and sons.

517
01:07:58,123 --> 01:08:00,564
Get out now.

518
01:08:02,042 --> 01:08:06,561
- Farewell.

519
01:08:35,299 --> 01:08:38,499
If I felt like, I'd be stuck.

520
01:08:40,928 --> 01:08:43,648
I think not.

521
01:09:47,404 --> 01:09:51,763
Good to see you, brother.
What brings you here?

522
01:09:52,196 --> 01:09:57,155
Nothing.

523
01:09:57,658 --> 01:10:01,218
You were our angel guns.
God be with you.

524
01:10:02,493 --> 01:10:05,452
But if you're decided to Stay
here, you're welcome.

525
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:08,106
Thanks, but I have to go.

526
01:10:09,286 --> 01:10:12,006
It's a shame.

527
01:10:12,411 --> 01:10:13,931
But how do tulle.

528
01:10:14,204 --> 01:10:18,763
Before you go to Sarah and Judith
'd like to get your thank the.

529
01:10:19,956 --> 01:10:22,836
I'm down at the water.

530
01:10:23,206 --> 01:10:27,605
- I'll send someone after them.
- On going there anyway.

531
01:10:28,039 --> 01:10:29,920
You'll enjoy.

532
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:50,790
- E Trinity.
- Welcome, brother.

533
01:10:53,129 --> 01:10:54,930
Come...

534
01:11:06,301 --> 01:11:10,699
Hot water.

535
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:23,670
And not your horse!

536
01:11:24,307 --> 01:11:26,747
He can swim.
I do.

537
01:11:27,225 --> 01:11:28,825
Far.

538
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,339
Oh, but...

539
01:11:33,934 --> 01:11:35,933
What are you...?

540
01:11:44,063 --> 01:11:49,663
From the first moment I saw you I
want you to stay with us.

541
01:11:50,147 --> 01:11:53,146
I thought.

542
01:11:56,733 --> 01:11:59,133
You could have your make a house here...

543
01:11:59,484 --> 01:12:01,884
with devoted spouses who care for you.

544
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:03,392
Wife...?

545
01:12:03,693 --> 01:12:08,851
You knew that to allow our faith
men to have multiple wives?

546
01:12:36,576 --> 01:12:38,496
This becomes deeper.

547
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:08,270
Farewell.

548
01:13:18,464 --> 01:13:20,424
Leaving?

549
01:13:20,714 --> 01:13:25,473
If your invitation still stands,
there is still one day.

550
01:13:25,924 --> 01:13:30,004
All we will share with you.

551
01:13:39,259 --> 01:13:42,739
There is no way
to stop the officer?

552
01:13:43,137 --> 01:13:47,656
He never cancel.
Vine, before you realize you.

553
01:13:48,094 --> 01:13:50,415
Our destiny is in God's hands.

554
01:13:50,804 --> 01:13:54,364
He has no weapons, so that
we are helpful.

555
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:57,564
God probably is not you
mind if you defend.

556
01:13:57,932 --> 01:14:00,531
We can not kill people.

557
01:14:00,891 --> 01:14:04,451
Bastards are worse than snakes.

558
01:14:04,809 --> 01:14:07,808
You will not be able to return
always cheek.

559
01:14:08,186 --> 01:14:10,385
We will see what the Lord wants.

560
01:14:10,728 --> 01:14:13,287
I hope that he has a gun.

561
01:14:13,646 --> 01:14:15,766
You could get rid of all the band.

562
01:14:16,104 --> 01:14:20,183
...

563
01:14:20,606 --> 01:14:22,845
We propose...

564
01:14:45,863 --> 01:14:48,342
Who could it be?

565
01:14:48,823 --> 01:14:53,862
Looks like you some bother tourists.

566
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:57,562
Or two fugitives without any law.

567
01:14:57,950 --> 01:15:00,829
Lord and he walked the fields.

568
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:03,799
But he had no army on his tail.

569
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,680
Ask him what you want.

570
01:15:05,993 --> 01:15:10,712
If something happens behind you.

571
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:40,650
Give to him who is thirsty
BEA says in the Bible.

572
01:15:53,339 --> 01:15:57,219
There is the saying:
Give the starving food...?

573
01:15:57,632 --> 01:15:59,271
No!

574
01:16:05,677 --> 01:16:08,277
You're Røyskatt, is not it?

575
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:19,578
And you're Flaumann...?
And you look on the Bambino?

576
01:16:21,639 --> 01:16:23,999
You know where it is?

577
01:16:24,348 --> 01:16:26,948
Yes, we are waiting for you.

578
01:16:33,184 --> 01:16:34,983
What are you doing here?

579
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,541
Hey, boss.

580
01:16:37,852 --> 01:16:40,252
I rotted there for several weeks.

581
01:16:40,604 --> 01:16:43,563
I thought you were hanged.

582
01:16:43,937 --> 01:16:49,135
I took her to gallop
because we pursued one.

583
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:53,725
We have retired and then I shot.

584
01:16:54,148 --> 01:16:56,747
And that was a lame sheriff.

585
01:16:57,107 --> 01:17:01,067
He is not chasing us.
I was just the same way.

586
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:04,242
- Did you kill him?
- Almost.

587
01:17:10,111 --> 01:17:13,151
What's with that badge?

588
01:17:13,529 --> 01:17:16,769
I hide behind the law.
Listen to me.

589
01:17:17,156 --> 01:17:20,636
A pleasant work awaits us.
Like a ripe plum.

590
01:17:21,488 --> 01:17:22,649
Cows?

591
01:17:24,489 --> 01:17:26,490
Cai!

592
01:17:27,324 --> 01:17:31,524
The most beautiful herd of stallions
we mark with iron red.

593
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,759
How you knew that I'm here?

594
01:17:35,076 --> 01:17:37,476
I said.

595
01:17:37,868 --> 01:17:39,268
Listen here, Bambino...

596
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:45,539
I do not want to listen.

597
01:17:50,288 --> 01:17:51,368
I just want to say...

598
01:17:51,664 --> 01:17:53,504
Get out!

599
01:17:54,247 --> 01:17:57,448
You heard the boss...?

600
01:18:04,793 --> 01:18:08,273
I have something very important to tell you.

601
01:18:08,668 --> 01:18:12,067
I saw the officer on the way
towards bordering Mexico.

602
01:18:12,463 --> 01:18:16,502
Means that it will stop at Mezcal.

603
01:18:16,922 --> 01:18:19,361
Peasants did not have any chance.

604
01:18:26,589 --> 01:18:31,988
Help me get rid of sheriff ª and
then get married.

605
01:18:32,425 --> 01:18:35,306
- Get married.
- Who...?

606
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:38,517
Sarah and Judith.
I have not decided yet.

607
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:43,084
I'll lay here
peasants...

608
01:19:07,979 --> 01:19:09,778
Definitely...?

609
01:19:10,185 --> 01:19:12,505
Yes, forever.

610
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,980
I want to forget the past.

611
01:19:26,231 --> 01:19:29,990
Our old mother swears by.

612
01:19:30,941 --> 01:19:34,900
Whether it becomes a woman's honor,
if I lie.

613
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:45,483
This is an agreement between us.
I'll help you.

614
01:19:47,363 --> 01:19:50,124
Whether our paths split...

615
01:19:54,072 --> 01:19:57,112
I'll not be sorry.

616
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:02,319
As respects the officer, I thought...

617
01:20:02,743 --> 01:20:07,022
- I'm the one who's thinking.
- That's what I thought and I.

618
01:20:11,369 --> 01:20:13,048
Idiot!

619
01:20:15,746 --> 01:20:17,625
Gringos...!

620
01:20:31,044 --> 01:20:33,083
It's nice that officer.

621
01:20:33,834 --> 01:20:37,434
It has a lot of money.

622
01:20:48,713 --> 01:20:51,873
- Stay here in the shade.
- Thank you.

623
01:20:58,757 --> 01:21:01,077
How do we go our
large enemy mine?

624
01:21:02,008 --> 01:21:05,248
Now I'm your best friend...!

625
01:21:05,634 --> 01:21:08,434
Your people shot at us yesterday.

626
01:21:09,887 --> 01:21:15,525
If you steal my horse I'll be
need to let them shoot you down.

627
01:21:16,012 --> 01:21:18,852
But if you work for me, you have horses.

628
01:21:19,224 --> 01:21:23,342
20...

629
01:21:23,765 --> 01:21:27,684
Mezcal will rob Texas
for 20 stallions.

630
01:21:28,098 --> 01:21:33,137
There is a special way of
eradicate the worm's that?

631
01:21:33,643 --> 01:21:36,681
That and you have to decide yourself.

632
01:21:37,394 --> 01:21:40,674
- Just one thing...
- And that is?

633
01:21:41,103 --> 01:21:46,782
Let me steal 20 horses
after work.

634
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:52,750
A work is humiliating.
Stealing is a pleasure.

635
01:21:58,150 --> 01:22:03,789
Jeff, people have to steal
the Mezcal 20 horses.

636
01:22:04,567 --> 01:22:06,926
Without Catur shot this time.

637
01:22:07,235 --> 01:22:11,915
Collided on the 20 stallions.

638
01:22:19,114 --> 01:22:22,233
- When we attack...
- When will the least expect it.

639
01:22:22,656 --> 01:22:26,615
Send a spy to follow them
and then let me know.

640
01:22:26,992 --> 01:22:28,912
'll Send Emiliano.

641
01:22:29,242 --> 01:22:33,961
Is capable of approaching hats
men without them - and realizing.

642
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:41,683
Thought that they would come 20...
gunmen all together.

643
01:22:42,121 --> 01:22:46,560
If you will not use the weapons you
fertilizers and the earth with your bodies.

644
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:49,519
Our faith forbids violence.

645
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:54,350
November 4 Just do not think we
could keep the officer chest.

646
01:22:57,166 --> 01:23:00,246
You need to ask the Lord
a temporary solution.

647
01:23:00,668 --> 01:23:03,548
Do you get that quick, man.

648
01:23:03,918 --> 01:23:08,556
We have to decide now.
Otherwise we will have no hope.

649
01:23:09,002 --> 01:23:14,761
We will only appear.
Do not want to kill.

650
01:23:19,214 --> 01:23:22,294
And that's fine.

651
01:23:24,214 --> 01:23:26,694
OK...
to begin.

652
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:40,794
When someone is heading by hand
straight to you what you do?

653
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:43,820
We gathered with the left and
then hit the right.

654
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:48,895
repeat

655
01:23:49,182 --> 01:23:53,182
You enforce the left and knock the right.

656
01:23:54,058 --> 01:23:55,817
Trying.

657
01:24:00,975 --> 01:24:04,174
Break with the left...

658
01:24:05,977 --> 01:24:10,217
See what's happening...
It's a matter of precision.

659
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:13,860
What do you do if you throw one
a filler citizen you?

660
01:24:14,272 --> 01:24:15,232
I do not know.

661
01:24:15,561 --> 01:24:19,401
Watch and down...

662
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:22,449
- Understand?
- Yeah, man.

663
01:24:22,817 --> 01:24:24,537
Ready?

664
01:24:27,149 --> 01:24:30,509
No...!
Look here to see what to do.

665
01:24:31,527 --> 01:24:33,047
Look at me.

666
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:36,793
Prepare?

667
01:24:43,986 --> 01:24:49,426
Remember...

668
01:24:57,615 --> 01:25:00,055
Experience is the best teacher.

669
01:25:00,367 --> 01:25:02,892
If you are unable to
move the hands, should

670
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,194
you use legs...

671
01:25:12,454 --> 01:25:16,053
Upstairs, it's your turn to try.

672
01:25:29,667 --> 01:25:32,147
Throw it up and then down.

673
01:25:34,502 --> 01:25:37,501
- A quick take on...
- No time to lose.

674
01:25:41,004 --> 01:25:43,443
EASC'll succeed.

675
01:25:45,296 --> 01:25:46,616
I thought...

676
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,000
If it's advice, keep it to yourself.

677
01:25:49,339 --> 01:25:52,419
I just want to get your opinion heard.

678
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,619
Tell.

679
01:25:56,966 --> 01:26:00,966
Do you think it's someone we
spying under that sombrero?

680
01:26:06,509 --> 01:26:10,789
- It's a serious chance.
- That's what I was thinking and I.

681
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:13,219
Come here.

682
01:26:13,554 --> 01:26:15,633
Try each other.

683
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:24,740
Up there, in the sombrero is
certainly a spy.

684
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:27,220
Bring it.

685
01:26:27,517 --> 01:26:30,197
Alive!

686
01:26:38,685 --> 01:26:42,485
- Problems
- nothing important.

687
01:26:42,936 --> 01:26:48,056
There's a man up the cliff...
Røyskatt invite him up here.

688
01:26:48,523 --> 01:26:50,923
Heaven to guard our friend.

689
01:26:51,314 --> 01:26:54,233
And the spy.

690
01:27:09,042 --> 01:27:13,761
If you're waiting for, you will talk.
Who sent you?

691
01:27:14,205 --> 01:27:17,005
Emiliano not betray anyone.

692
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:29,259
Emiliano says it all.
U are one of the people of Mezcal.

693
01:27:29,652 --> 01:27:33,251
Officer promised to Mezcal
20 stallions...

694
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:37,128
If we displace the peasants.

695
01:27:58,627 --> 01:28:02,587
Not to go to that plan
good without me finally!

696
01:28:03,045 --> 01:28:07,325
I know you too well.
You're like an open book.

697
01:28:09,332 --> 01:28:12,971
Then let's see if I read it correctly.

698
01:28:14,576 --> 01:28:18,535
You will take the place of Mexicans
'll steal the 20 horses..

699
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:24,110
And then you run with Røyskatt
Flaumann and the Frisco.

700
01:28:25,361 --> 01:28:28,401

Children, women, old...

01:29:39,264 --> 01:29:41,984
I've killed them all?

717
01:29:42,344 --> 01:29:43,904
Yes, cats, dogs...

01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:48,100

722
01:30:05,284 --> 01:30:06,364

723
01:30:06,659 --> 01:30:10,138

When it?

727
01:30:18,107 --> 01:30:23,066
If they catch you must
be back around...

728
01:30:23,479 --> 01:30:24,640
To catch who?

729
01:30:24,936 --> 01:30:25,816
Horse thieves.

730
01:30:26,104 --> 01:30:28,104
Them?

731
01:30:28,976 --> 01:30:31,975
- And Sheriff
-'s some resemblance.

732
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:35,829
They are indeed.

733
01:30:36,427 --> 01:30:38,827
You know where they go?

734
01:30:39,174 --> 01:30:42,094
They said...

735
01:30:42,507 --> 01:30:44,546
...

736
01:30:44,923 --> 01:30:47,483
Put display them out in front of the office.

737
01:30:47,838 --> 01:30:50,316
If you catch them, we'll pay for it.

738
01:30:50,667 --> 01:30:54,626
They drove to the bordering...
we solve this, and Sheriff.

739
01:31:05,073 --> 01:31:07,273
All the children are in Caruth.

740
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:11,610
Take care of children.

741
01:31:13,399 --> 01:31:16,759
Flaumann, go behind the house.

742
01:31:19,145 --> 01:31:23,905
- Do you know where Tobias
- He went down into the river.

743
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:27,790
And the horses?
Where did you go

744
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:32,500
Horses...

745
01:31:33,386 --> 01:31:35,905
It sees something, brother sentinel?

746
01:31:36,258 --> 01:31:39,738
No, and Sheriff, nothing.

747
01:31:44,335 --> 01:31:49,014
Yes...

748
01:31:50,206 --> 01:31:52,046
Get ready positions..

749
01:32:17,351 --> 01:32:19,430
E Jonathan.

750
01:32:33,298 --> 01:32:35,137
Are you looking officer..

751
01:32:35,465 --> 01:32:37,344
What does he want?

752
01:32:37,836 --> 01:32:39,675
Let them justice.

753
01:32:40,001 --> 01:32:45,080
Some of the horses were furaþi,
and you must bring them back.

754
01:32:45,539 --> 01:32:48,339
I can not help him now.

755
01:32:48,748 --> 01:32:51,507
Do not keep all the horses for you, I hope?

756
01:32:51,827 --> 01:32:55,867
- What way?
- Horses the officer.

757
01:32:56,281 --> 01:33:01,000
- You came to tell me that?
- Among other things...

758
01:33:01,442 --> 01:33:04,762
A man came into town today

759
01:33:05,189 --> 01:33:08,950
with mustache, sheriff badge and crutches.

760
01:33:09,354 --> 01:33:12,354
A typical lame ª sheriff.

761
01:33:12,685 --> 01:33:16,045
I seek out those due to
whom remained lame.

762
01:33:16,391 --> 01:33:19,111
- I sent the bordering.
- Good.

763
01:33:19,474 --> 01:33:22,354
No.

764
01:33:23,845 --> 01:33:25,764
Thank you.

765
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:27,890
Yeah, sure..

766
01:33:28,216 --> 01:33:31,216
- I want my share.
- I have not thought about it.

767
01:33:31,587 --> 01:33:33,227
Why did you take with you and him?

768
01:33:33,504 --> 01:33:37,823
Could not remain in the city.
Beþii When people say the whole truth.

769
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:53,799
Put Mexican and Caruth
Make sure you stay drunk.

770
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:55,515
Very good, mate.

771
01:34:04,855 --> 01:34:06,815
Where the hell is Tobias?

772
01:34:07,186 --> 01:34:09,626
Just coming.

773
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:20,350
- I thought you were gone.
- No, I worked hard.

774
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:25,599
I dig some graves, now that we have time?

775
01:34:26,046 --> 01:34:29,725
I hope you do not want to Turn
place in a cemetery?

776
01:34:30,127 --> 01:34:33,285
- How do we stop the officer?
- By faith.

777
01:34:36,624 --> 01:34:39,783
Faith is an invincible fortress.

778
01:34:40,161 --> 01:34:45,840
Officer will not shoot as women
children and defenseless.

779
01:34:46,323 --> 01:34:49,082
Maybe he was right.

780
01:35:08,765 --> 01:35:13,005
You shoot a gun
group of children and women?

781
01:35:15,801 --> 01:35:18,360
Not in children.

782
01:35:18,842 --> 01:35:23,201
If you do not do that, then
no officer will not shoot them.

783
01:35:23,629 --> 01:35:26,149
What are you thinking now?

784
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:31,940
You're the one who thinks about...
and coming and with a good idea.

785
01:35:41,823 --> 01:35:46,102
If it fails and you" trick faith"
whole valley will be red with the blood spilled.

786
01:36:00,393 --> 01:36:03,152
Coming!

787
01:36:25,515 --> 01:36:28,155
Plays their last card.

788
01:36:37,219 --> 01:36:40,860
Forward...

789
01:37:13,241 --> 01:37:16,480
I welcome your wishes, old man?

790
01:37:18,847 --> 01:37:23,286
Your silence does not prevent me to get your
destroy your precious poverty.

791
01:37:23,628 --> 01:37:25,868
- Why waste my time?
- Quiet!

792
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:32,769
It's one thing to do.

793
01:37:33,107 --> 01:37:37,307
It will be a busy day for you.

794
01:37:37,681 --> 01:37:41,441
But you earn money in an honest way.

795
01:37:41,805 --> 01:37:44,725
...

796
01:37:48,028 --> 01:37:51,508
Destroy the whole.
Start with the house.

797
01:37:52,674 --> 01:37:58,353
But not too hard strigaþi.
Hate noise.

798
01:37:58,538 --> 01:38:02,856
Give cãruþelor fire and tents
chased away those cows and dirty.

799
01:38:03,007 --> 01:38:06,286
And then it's to the chase...
Mezcal and will handle the rest.

800
01:38:08,754 --> 01:38:11,074
You speechless?

801
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:15,529
You lost the battle, ofiþerule
...

802
01:38:18,503 --> 01:38:22,303
Opinions of others must be respected.

803
01:38:22,402 --> 01:38:25,522
You're educated.

804
01:38:26,615 --> 01:38:28,534
Jeff...

805
01:38:37,377 --> 01:38:40,696
Jeff...

806
01:38:48,683 --> 01:38:51,163
Start, guys.

807
01:39:11,877 --> 01:39:14,396
Jeff...

808
01:39:15,955 --> 01:39:18,875
- Come here.
- A second, guys.

809
01:39:21,912 --> 01:39:23,431
A new plan..

810
01:39:23,743 --> 01:39:25,862
We start with cãruþele and tents?

811
01:39:26,575 --> 01:39:28,775
I do not think that.

812
01:39:29,115 --> 01:39:30,794
To drive out the cows?

813
01:39:31,113 --> 01:39:33,073
Do you mind your animals?

814
01:39:33,402 --> 01:39:36,322
I do not come...
What to do?

815
01:39:36,735 --> 01:39:41,655
Respecþi to your rules.
We're in your house.

816
01:39:42,105 --> 01:39:44,226
Drop your weapons.

817
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:47,642
- What?
- Make your way you mean.

818
01:39:52,767 --> 01:39:56,926
That'll make him brother
Tobias very happy.

819
01:39:57,346 --> 01:40:00,345
Hates guns.

820
01:40:08,256 --> 01:40:11,934
Hope you have a good reason

821
01:40:12,379 --> 01:40:15,578
There's a good reason, my friend!

822
01:40:25,244 --> 01:40:28,204
Your plan has functioned as a miracle.

823
01:40:36,112 --> 01:40:40,872
And Sheriff...
That's really infact.

824
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,600
Look, you can make belief.

825
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:47,420
Yes, in a pipe of rifle.

826
01:40:48,938 --> 01:40:50,538
It happened.

827
01:40:50,852 --> 01:40:53,851
For now...
but it's not and you still end up.

828
01:40:54,226 --> 01:40:57,425
- Do not...
- Yes, it ends here!

829
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:03,363
Must end here.

830
01:41:26,454 --> 01:41:30,614
These words told the preacher,
son of David, king in Jerusalem:

831
01:41:31,035 --> 01:41:32,714
Your hat...

832
01:41:33,034 --> 01:41:37,953
It's a time to be born up, it's time
to die, to love and to hate.

833
01:41:38,405 --> 01:41:40,365
It's time to...

834
01:41:40,735 --> 01:41:44,615
Brothers, it is written that it's a time
a fight...

835
01:41:44,984 --> 01:41:46,783
A win, brothers!

836
01:43:33,352 --> 01:43:35,072
Excuse me, bro

837
01:43:57,229 --> 01:43:59,028
No, man, let him.

838
01:45:44,648 --> 01:45:46,687
Come back, brother...!
Skip to action!

839
01:46:33,169 --> 01:46:34,929
- Thank you, brother.
- Get out.

840
01:46:35,273 --> 01:46:38,513
Gather the horses and get out.

841
01:46:43,863 --> 01:46:46,463
Valley is yours,
but give me horses are mine.

842
01:46:46,892 --> 01:46:49,573
- Which Horse
- The ones I've stolen from me.

843
01:46:49,927 --> 01:46:53,446
- Watch what you say.
- Are horse thieves.

844
01:46:55,019 --> 01:46:57,699
Major never lie.

845
01:46:58,133 --> 01:47:02,373
Have you been to Nebraska?

846
01:47:04,197 --> 01:47:08,437
They say there's a variation
of your beautiful meadow.

847
01:47:13,204 --> 01:47:17,284
This..

848
01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:37,165
Ofiþerule...

849
01:47:48,273 --> 01:47:50,192
- Thank you...
- forget it!

850
01:47:50,545 --> 01:47:53,305
I thank God, brother.

851
01:47:53,747 --> 01:47:56,626
Satan left on this earth.

852
01:47:56,987 --> 01:47:59,267
Receives our thanks, Dad.

853
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:03,079
What does that mean?

854
01:48:03,515 --> 01:48:05,754
Here!

855
01:48:09,322 --> 01:48:12,882
- What's this?
- It is our sign, bro.

856
01:48:13,997 --> 01:48:17,396
E Law holy plate.

857
01:48:24,098 --> 01:48:27,578
Do not you know anything?

858
01:48:28,014 --> 01:48:33,612
I just think that those people would
have to cover those dead as...

859
01:48:34,118 --> 01:48:35,598
And I?

860
01:48:37,065 --> 01:48:39,105
I'm not mad at t

861
01:48:39,464 --> 01:48:41,823
I'm mad at my mom..

862
01:48:42,244 --> 01:48:46,843
I should have you choke
or drown you at birth.

863
01:48:47,675 --> 01:48:50,394
O you naughty son's insidious...

864
01:48:50,831 --> 01:48:53,751
Do not be nervous, and Sheriff.
It was the hand of fate.

865
01:48:54,158 --> 01:48:56,397
Hold.

866
01:48:57,271 --> 01:49:01,030
Get together with destiny
your sisters and your brothers.

867
01:49:01,482 --> 01:49:05,920
And ancestors, cows, everybody.

868
01:49:13,143 --> 01:49:15,663
Always unlucky!

869
01:49:37,268 --> 01:49:39,348
Let us pray.

870
01:49:50,822 --> 01:49:54,382
God, in your honor Wholesale
loving cups.

871
01:49:54,783 --> 01:49:57,422
Receives these sheep...

872
01:49:57,853 --> 01:50:01,052
over which the hateful
guns and threw a pity...

873
01:50:01,515 --> 01:50:04,555
the purifying fire of your forgiveness.

874
01:50:04,966 --> 01:50:09,005
Destroy the seed of evil that
soul sit handcuffed him.

875
01:50:09,472 --> 01:50:11,471
Receives it in the light of your spirit.

876
01:50:11,831 --> 01:50:16,271
He will work until you faint.

877
01:50:16,754 --> 01:50:19,474
We cultivate these fields...

878
01:50:19,871 --> 01:50:22,471
And to collect the work of

879
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:26,501
to cut down the forest, build
home and raise livestock.

880
01:50:26,902 --> 01:50:28,501
And after fatigue of the day...

881
01:50:28,879 --> 01:50:32,518
will return home with joy.

882
01:50:32,963 --> 01:50:36,843
Together with his wife I'll be
thanks to you, O God...

883
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:40,379
because you drive through it
needs earthly life.

884
01:50:40,793 --> 01:50:43,952
I thank you for your blessings.

885
01:50:44,330 --> 01:50:48,970
And I hope to always be worthy
of your Charnelle love.

886
01:50:51,707 --> 01:50:55,067
Where is our new brother?

887
01:51:00,644 --> 01:51:05,522
Why do you want to come with you, Bambino...?

888
01:51:05,981 --> 01:51:10,081
Lost, unless you want to be
shot while sleeping.

889
01:51:10,663 --> 01:51:14,303
- I am your brother.
- I'm beginning to doubt it.

890
01:51:14,767 --> 01:51:20,546
I'm going out west in California,
and you go to the east.

891
01:52:09,496 --> 01:52:11,616

They wanted to take my boots, but you have

895
