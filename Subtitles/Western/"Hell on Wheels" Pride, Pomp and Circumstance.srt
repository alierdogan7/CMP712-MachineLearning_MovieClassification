1
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,814
Make sure that's tight.

2
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:49,599
Closer.
Closer to the platform.

3
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:51,968
Musicians come on,
over here, over here.

4
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:53,169
Thank you.

5
00:00:53,294 --> 00:00:54,805
Ah, what... what are you going to play?

6
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,861
Uh, Dixie.

7
00:00:56,986 --> 00:00:58,474
Dixie, you idiot.

8
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:00,644
"Battle Hymn of the Republic,"
do you know it?

9
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,347
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

10
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:09,217
Uh, photographer, over here,
please, on the platform

11
00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:12,531
with me and be at the ready.

12
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,158
Now, on my signal, be ready
to play, loudly.

13
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:25,633
Ah.

14
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:30,298
She takes my arm even though
she stabs me in the back.

15
00:01:30,464 --> 00:01:33,607
Have you given my proposal
any further consideration?

16
00:01:33,732 --> 00:01:37,143
You mean the money you're squeezing
out of me for Robert's maps?

17
00:01:37,268 --> 00:01:39,391
I'm only asking
for what is fair, Thomas.

18
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,916
Extortion doesn't become a lady.

19
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,417
I will not fall prey to it.

20
00:01:48,312 --> 00:01:50,513
Excuse me.

21
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,328
Play, play, play, play, play.

22
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:26,047
Ah, Jordan.
Welcome, welcome.

23
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:36,566
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
an honor for me to introduce

24
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:40,027
a true friend of the
railroad who has come here

25
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,929
with the full backing of
the United States Senate,

26
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:47,810
to meet with the Indians,
to thwart their opposition to our cause.

27
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:54,073
From the great state of Illinois...
Senator Jordan Crane.

28
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,157
On behalf of my fellow
committee members,

29
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,825
I thank you for that warm reception.

30
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,827
But down to business.

31
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:09,964
As Mr. Durant said, I am here,

32
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:15,736
Laurel branch in hand,
to meet with the Indians.

33
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:21,743
But in the other hand,
I wield a cudgel,

34
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:25,413
and that cudgel is
the full and mighty force

35
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,681
of the United States Military.

36
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,818
If these savages want to scrap,

37
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:35,465
then by God, we'll give them
one they won't soon disremember.

38
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,029
Well done, Jordan.

39
00:03:44,154 --> 00:03:45,225
Well done.

40
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,676
<font color="#3399FF">Sync and correction by Mlmlte</font>
<font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

41
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,133
All right, let me grab a saddle.

42
00:04:35,637 --> 00:04:40,350
First, the Fuzzies, and now, they're
letting the Injuns come for a party.

43
00:04:40,475 --> 00:04:43,491
I tell you, lads, we'll soon be
working for the likes of them.

44
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:46,122
It's a sad state of affairs.

45
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:48,882
I'll drink to that.

46
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:59,400
Reverend... you ain't in
here for a drink, are you?

47
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:02,694
No. A spirit of a different
sort now possesses me.

48
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:12,020
I come here, Mr. Bohannon, hat in hand.

49
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:17,051
I wish to hell you would stop
trying to save me, preacher.

50
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:21,855
Oh, don't worry, son,
I'm learning my limitations,

51
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,825
but the lord believes one
good turn deserves another.

52
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,729
And since I provided asylum for you,

53
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:31,164
I've come here to ask for your help.

54
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,960
What kind of help could
I possibly provide you?

55
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,137
Well, a band of Cheyenne
is coming to talk peace

56
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:40,639
with the Senator and Mr. Durant.

57
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:41,941
Yeah. I heard.

58
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:45,845
Whose crazy-ass idea was that?

59
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:48,646
I beg your pardon, preacher,

60
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:53,175
but... somehow,
I don't see that ending well.

61
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:57,055
I want you to talk
to your walking bosses,

62
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,426
you tell them to keep
their men in check

63
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:05,657
because if you don't,
we're gonna have bloodshed on our hands.

64
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:13,761
I'll do what I can.

65
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:19,366
Do I have your word?

66
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:32,100
A toast in honor of
the fair-haired maiden of the west.

67
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,022
Your spirit is a testament to all.

68
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:36,415
Thank you, Senator.

69
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:41,496
You must be anxious
to return to society.

70
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:43,278
I am.

71
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:47,991
But first, I must tend
to some unfinished business.

72
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,904
Well, speaking of which,

73
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:52,306
you won't mind if Mr. Durant and I

74
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:54,041
discuss some business of our own?

75
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,709
Not at all, Senator, please.

76
00:06:55,834 --> 00:07:00,670
So, doc, I hear there was
some delay with your payroll.

77
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:01,949
Why the money problems?

78
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:03,918
Oh, ha ha.

79
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:06,619
A miscommunication between
the bank and Pinkerton's.

80
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:10,690
No, no, no, the, uh,
the payroll was delivered and made.

81
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:14,059
Well, then the credit issue with
the banks must also be resolved?

82
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,894
Credit issue?

83
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,131
Well, I don't know the particulars,

84
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:23,269
but word is credit was no longer
being extended to the Union Pacific.

85
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:27,239
Oh, Senator, if our
credit line wasn't open,

86
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,324
we wouldn't be able to operate.

87
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,326
Hmm.

88
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,746
What about the route to the Rockies?

89
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,664
The Rockies, what of it?

90
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,219
Thomas has been trying
to explain it to me.

91
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:44,356
I think I finally
managed to grasp it.

92
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:47,693
That the route my husband
mapped through the Rockies

93
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:50,762
holds the key to Thomas
choosing the right path

94
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,597
to make his 40 miles here.

95
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,523
Is that right, doc?

96
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,868
Well, I wouldn't go...

97
00:07:57,993 --> 00:08:00,647
Do you have these maps?

98
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:04,400
No.

99
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,903
Well...

100
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,578
Well, that is unfortunate.

101
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,380
Mm-hmm.

102
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:13,917
No 40 miles by may 16th,
no government subsidies.

103
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:15,685
You have heard that
the Central Pacific

104
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,921
have made their 40, haven't you?

105
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:20,189
No.

106
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:22,001
Oh, yes.

107
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:25,130
It seems these Chinamen are
quite the busy worker bees.

108
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,467
Then she say for one of these,
I can get whatever I want.

109
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:38,497
Yeah, I need a word
with Mr. Ferguson.

110
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:43,702
If that's all right?

111
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:48,507
I'll talk to him.

112
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,991
You ain't gotta worry about
us messin' with no Injuns.

113
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:59,826
Ain't no Redman
ever bloodied my back.

114
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:02,396
I got your word, then?

115
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:03,663
Good.

116
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:06,100
We don't need no more
fightin', do we?

117
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:09,215
I see how you feel that way...
After that ass whoopin' I put on ya.

118
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:11,301
I got news for you, son,
I know you cheated.

119
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,678
What the hell are you talking about?

120
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,474
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

121
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:18,725
Pepper juice on them hand wraps
you was wearing, I tasted it.

122
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,147
I got to hand it to you,
though, that was pretty slick.

123
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:23,115
You need to hand
that to somebody else.

124
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,565
I don't know nothin'
about no pepper juice.

125
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:27,910
Hmm.

126
00:09:29,212 --> 00:09:31,279
Somebody sure as hell cheated.

127
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:35,551
If you want a re-match,
you know where to find me.

128
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:39,421
Yeah.

129
00:09:57,772 --> 00:10:00,407
How did your mother die?

130
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:03,777
Consumption.

131
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:07,581
She's with God now.

132
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,785
Yes, she is.

133
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:17,990
My mother died when I was just a boy.

134
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:22,004
I remember her taking me

135
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:24,597
to the creek to wash in the mornings.

136
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,922
She'd pretend to drop me,
and then grab me fast.

137
00:10:32,938 --> 00:10:34,968
No matter how many times she did it,

138
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,443
it would always make me laugh.

139
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:44,811
She's with God now, too.

140
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:49,482
Was your mother a Christian?

141
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,067
No.

142
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,281
Then how can she be with God?

143
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:15,425
I'm sorry your father left
you and your mother alone.

144
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:27,562
My father did not leave us.

145
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:34,068
He was called away on
his great Christian mission.

146
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:36,774
He's a servant of God.

147
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:40,578
He was called to help
the inferiors...

148
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:44,078
Like... Negroes.

149
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,082
And the Indians?

150
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:17,813
Would you like to hold it for me,
or do you have some information?

151
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:21,015
Mr. Durant has taken private funds

152
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,286
from the railroad
for his personnel use.

153
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,580
How much, and for what?

154
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:31,325
$147,000.

155
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,004
He is speculating
on the railroad stock.

156
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,802
Money is not necessary this time.

157
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,346
Oh?

158
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,732
I would like information instead.

159
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:53,189
What do you mean?

160
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,505
There is a man named Harper,

161
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,351
a former union soldier,

162
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:03,689
sergeant Frank Harper, I believe.

163
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:06,225
He used to work for us.

164
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,540
He run off, and I'd like
to know where he is.

165
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:14,419
How am I supposed to find him?

166
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:19,638
I heard sergeant Harper hails
from your home state of Illinois.

167
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:26,600
Matter of fact, he still has family
that reside in the city of Chicago.

168
00:13:28,203 --> 00:13:29,880
Frank Harper, huh?

169
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:31,348
Well, I have my people...

170
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:33,775
Yes, you will.

171
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:57,697
Set it out somewhere here.

172
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:06,030
There you go, man.

173
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,452
Keep it moving there, lads.

174
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:13,955
Hep, hep.

175
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,462
Clear!

176
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:23,922
Down!

177
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,183
I'll be damned.

178
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,519
Come on now, up and out
of there, boys.

179
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,438
It's our time for
collecting some scalps.

180
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:44,284
Y'all Negroes get back in that cut.

181
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:46,377
We ain't got no fight
with them Injuns.

182
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,255
Y'all heard the man.

183
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,574
Well, well.

184
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,081
What's the matter, boy-o?

185
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,426
You niggers afraid the nappy
fuzz will be sliced off

186
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:55,746
the top of your pates, are ya?

187
00:15:55,912 --> 00:15:57,763
We ain't got no dog in this fight.

188
00:15:57,888 --> 00:15:59,208
You on your own.

189
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:00,465
We got business, you and me,

190
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,503
and I'll see it done, so I will.

191
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,213
Why are we stopped?

192
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:05,938
We ain't.

193
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:08,274
Toole, get your men back in that cut!

194
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,775
We got a road to build.

195
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,709
I want y'all sons of bitches
working, all of you.

196
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:14,974
I don't take orders from
any man walloped by a nigger.

197
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,607
You're fired.
Get off my cut.

198
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,089
I'll fix your flank
for this, Bohannon.

199
00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:26,527
You have my word on that.

200
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:28,625
Oh, yeah?

201
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,531
Get off my cut.

202
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:35,786
Come on, lads, let's go.

203
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,587
Aw, the hell with it.

204
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,425
Get out the hell out of me way.

205
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,081
All right, there's work to get done.

206
00:16:52,206 --> 00:16:55,651
Y'all forget about them Injuns,
and you give me the full chisel,

207
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:59,352
assholes and elbows,
or I'll fire the lot of ya.

208
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:09,597
You seem to have an answer
for everything, Thomas.

209
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:11,166
I always do.

210
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,034
But why should I believe you?

211
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:16,070
Well, why wouldn't you, Jordan?

212
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:17,671
It's the truth.

213
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:20,140
We've worked
together long enough

214
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:22,375
for you to give me a little
more credit than that.

215
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,128
Is there a point you're
trying to make, Jordan?

216
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:28,873
To the point.

217
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,471
I'm well aware of your schemes.

218
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,491
And to put it plain,
they don't concern me,

219
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:44,355
except...
When they concern me.

220
00:17:48,726 --> 00:17:51,654
Jordan, why are you really here?

221
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,008
I'm here to tell you
that filching Union Pacific railroad

222
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:59,203
funds for personal speculating
concerns me greatly.

223
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:03,014
Another unfounded rumor
created by my rivals.

224
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:04,458
Hmm.

225
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:10,005
$147,000.

226
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:15,344
How's that for an unfounded rumor?

227
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:21,799
People say you've lost a lot
of money in the market, doc.

228
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:25,803
Is it really so bad
that it's come to this?

229
00:18:25,928 --> 00:18:29,496
I have nothing more

Don't be afraid.

246
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:50,572
You're among friends.

247
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:55,444
I am reverend Cole.

248
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:01,951
These are my children,
Joseph and Ruth.

249
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,078
We are pleased you have come here

250
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:09,299
in the name of peace and fellowship.

251
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:13,393
Are you the daughter he abandoned?

252
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:18,008
Maybe peace and fellowship are more

253
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:22,202
important to him than his own family?

254
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:32,612
This, Senator Crane,
is from the United States Government.

255
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:38,127
Do you understand?

256
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:41,740
I speak your language.

257
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:43,631
Well, good.

258
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:48,270
Uh, Senator Crane has come here

259
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:51,083
to offer your people
a better way of life.

260
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:53,085
Better than what?

261
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:57,047
Oh, better than what you have.

262
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:02,303
I like what I have.

263
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,717
Hmm.

264
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:06,287
I understand that...

265
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:11,186
But... your people
live in the stone age.

266
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,629
We live at the beginning

267
00:21:16,754 --> 00:21:19,022
of a great industrial revolution.

268
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,700
He doesn't understand...

269
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:22,448
Chief, chief, chief,

270
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,238
the United States Government
is offering you

271
00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:27,578
a piece of land of your own.

272
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,143
We have our own land.

273
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:32,768
No, it's not yours.

274
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,752
It's the U.S. Government's.

275
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,712
Did they buy it?

276
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,006
- No.
- Did they trade for it?

277
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,357
It's not like that. We...

278
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:42,092
Then how can they own it?

279
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,012
He has a point.

280
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,930
If you accept our offer,

281
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:57,066
you won't have to hunt buffalo
anymore or roam the prairie.

282
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,736
You can depend on your
country to take care of you.

283
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:04,782
You are not my country.

284
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:08,878
We will give you everything you need

285
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:12,873
if you will just submit
to living on a reservation.

286
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,043
We need nothing from you.

287
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,253
Mr. Durant, if we could just...

288
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,856
I'm done, reverend!

289
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:23,516
Good luck.

290
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:40,741

291

00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:57,324
She asked who Jesus Christ is.

294
00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:05,731
I told her Jesus Christ
is our savior,

295
00:23:05,856 --> 00:23:08,334
born of a virgin.

296
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:21,191
What did she say, Joseph?

297
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:26,851
She said, she would like
to hear Mary explain

298
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,450
the virgin birth to her husband.

299
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:54,892
Mr. Bohannon.

300
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,613
Ahem.

301
00:23:56,738 --> 00:23:59,897
Ma'am.

302
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,066
What are you doing here?

303
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,653
Well, I guess I made
a stupid promise to somebody.

304
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:07,446
I figured the last thing
you'd want to see is an Indian.

305
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,292
Well, these are peaceful Indians.

306
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,357
They're Joseph's people.

307
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:13,662
Yeah, right.

308
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,564
Yeah, you're right, go ahead.

309
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:19,424
No, it's not the Indians
I'm worried about.

310
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:26,907
You'll be happy to
know I've taken your advice.

311
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,718
I'm making arrangements
for passage back east.

312
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,917
Best place for you.

313
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:32,913
Right.

314
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,141
Well, if you'd excuse...

315
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,400
What's wrong?

316
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,561
Mrs. Bell?

317
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:50,696
Where did you get that?
That's mine!

318
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:53,532
Not yours.

319
00:24:53,657 --> 00:24:54,933
Stop. It's all right.

320
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:56,893
Take your hands off me! Go!

321
00:24:57,018 --> 00:24:58,205
Calm down!

322
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:06,644
Take...

323
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:10,071
That was your husband's
hat, wasn't it?

324
00:25:11,206 --> 00:25:13,074
Wasn't it?

325
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:17,975
What happened, Mr. Bohannon?

326
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,560
You... you lied to me.

327
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,186
It was your people.

328
00:25:26,922 --> 00:25:28,556
Where are you headed?

329
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:31,702
I'm going to tell
Mr. Durant that they're here,

330
00:25:31,827 --> 00:25:33,603
the ones that committed the massacre.

331
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:34,871
The ones who murdered my husband.

332
00:25:34,996 --> 00:25:36,573
Are you sure you want to do that?

333
00:25:36,698 --> 00:25:38,745
Yes, of course I do.
Why wouldn't I?

334
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:40,209
Because it will lead to more killin',
not just the braves,

335
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:41,582
but the women and children, too.

336
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,970
What is your stake
in this, Mr. Bohannon?

337
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,919
Lady, I ain't got one.

338
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:48,672
Then why do you care?

339
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:53,489
Mrs. Bell,
there is a price attached to everything.

340
00:25:53,614 --> 00:25:56,847
You think you can afford
the cost of this, then you go on.

341
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,702
You must think of
your women and children.

342
00:26:11,827 --> 00:26:13,864
I am thinking of them.

343
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,406
How can I ask them

344
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:18,041
to give up what they have for this?

345
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:22,581
I have never seen such
a dark, filthy place.

346
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:27,182
If you walk away from
here without a deal,

347
00:26:27,307 --> 00:26:29,296
you are asking for war.

348
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:33,523
No. You ask for war.

349
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:35,657
Listen to reason.

350
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:37,387
Your people will be slaughtered.

351
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:38,972
As will yours.

352
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:40,261
Gentlemen!

353
00:26:40,386 --> 00:26:43,097
We're here to find
a way to peace, not war.

354
00:26:43,222 --> 00:26:46,968
Be warned, we Cheyenne are plenty,

355
00:26:47,093 --> 00:26:49,024
and my braves are
hungry for a good fight.

356
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,068
Enough, Jordan, enough.

357
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,640
You're pissing in the wind.

358
00:26:52,765 --> 00:26:55,342
They only understand
one thing... strength.

359
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:59,326
Now, let me give it to you
plain and simple, chief.

360
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:04,957
This train means the end
of life as you know it.

361
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:09,689
My son had a vision.

362
00:27:09,814 --> 00:27:13,465
He will defeat your train.

363
00:27:20,424 --> 00:27:21,765
Wait.

364
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:26,137
Chief, perhaps your son
would like a chance

365
00:27:26,262 --> 00:27:31,191
to see his vision come true, hmm?

366
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,797
Hello, ladies.

367
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:45,279
What is this all about?

368
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:49,474
It seems an Injun's gonna
race a train back to town.

369
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:54,316
I guess you changed your mind.

370
00:28:58,082 --> 00:29:00,072
For the moment.

371
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,564
Stoke that fire.

372
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,756
Come on. Come on.

373
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,523
Come on! Come on!

374
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,241
Yeah!

375
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:16,351
Ha ha ha ha.

376
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:59,523
Well, I think the chief
got my message loud and clear.

377
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:01,962
Don't you?

378
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:03,674
Well done, doc.

379
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,906
Ahem.

380
00:33:05,911 --> 00:33:09,070
But there's still the
matter of a $147,000.

381
00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:14,187
One word from me, and
hordes of investigators

382
00:33:14,312 --> 00:33:16,870
will be crawling through your books.

383
00:33:25,827 --> 00:33:27,971
You're bluffing.

384
00:33:28,096 --> 00:33:29,966
What makes you think so?

385
00:33:30,132 --> 00:33:33,476
Because if I fall, you fall with me.

386
00:33:33,601 --> 00:33:38,183
Not so, doc.

387
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,607
Not so.

388
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:46,021
I sold all
my landholdings in Nebraska,

389
00:33:46,146 --> 00:33:49,725
and I've divested myself of
my Credit Mobilier stock.

390
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:53,018
All at a nice profit, I might add.

391
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:57,827
You have nothing over me anymore.

392
00:34:00,525 --> 00:34:04,834
You once had my head
in a vice, Thomas,

393
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,676
now, I have your pecker in my pocket.

394
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:13,013
I'll be leaving for Chicago tonight

395
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:14,844
and will report this
as soon as I arrive.

396
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:19,099
You'll be trading in your fancy
duds for prison pinstripes.

397
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,354
You're finished, Durant.

398
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:24,047
All this, gone.

399
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,898
Jordan, please.

400
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,841
She wants you to take this.

401
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,655
And she wanted you to know she, too,

402
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,791
has lost her husband.

403
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:03,393
He was killed in a fight
with one of his own arrows.

404
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,061
The other braves,

405
00:35:05,227 --> 00:35:08,106
they brought her this hat.

406
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,555
Tell her thank you.

407
00:36:26,997 --> 00:36:29,374
We will not return.

408
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:31,109
Chief, I beg you to reconsider.

409
00:36:31,234 --> 00:36:33,879
Son, these people are not good.

410
00:36:34,004 --> 00:36:36,277
You stay here, you will die.

411
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,989
Come back with me.

412
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:42,659
Please. Come home with your father.

413
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,990
I can't, father.

414
00:36:46,115 --> 00:36:49,874
I... I can't.

415
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:22,815
Is the chief your father?

416
00:37:24,884 --> 00:37:27,261
Why did you leave him?

417
00:37:27,386 --> 00:37:30,221
So I could help the inferiors.

00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:55,788

Sit down.

431
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:11,599
Robert needed you
as much as you needed him.

432
00:39:25,998 --> 00:39:29,834
My husband died for his dream.

433
00:39:32,004 --> 00:39:34,288
Now it's up to you
to bring it to life.

434
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:49,262
The blasted red devils
are just up on the hill.

435
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,264
I say we go get 'em now,

436
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,558
bring back their bloody
heads on pikes.

437
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,938
Now where else might y'all be headed?

438
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:01,691
Out of the way, Bohannon.

439
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,900
We aim to go after the Injuns,

440
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:06,102
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

441
00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:09,747
The hell there ain't.

442
00:40:09,872 --> 00:40:11,749
You're outnumbered.

443
00:40:11,874 --> 00:40:13,911
You can't kill us all, lad.

444
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:16,421
Aw, I can kill about 5 of ya.

445
00:40:16,546 --> 00:40:19,424
You hear that? He's not
even fully loaded.

446
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:22,926
Only 5 bullets he's got.

447
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:25,256
I got 6 bullets...

448
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:27,467
I was just gonna shoot you twice.

449
00:40:30,526 --> 00:40:31,835
Gentlemen?

450
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,961
Yeah.

451
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:41,211
There's still only two of you.

452
00:40:41,336 --> 00:40:49,119
Oh, I'd count again if I were you.

453
00:40:49,244 --> 00:40:52,613
You see, it's important
to Mr. Thomas Durant

454
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:58,227
that the Injuns are not harmed.

455
00:40:58,352 --> 00:41:05,100
I'm sure you boys can find
some amusement here in town.

456
00:41:05,225 --> 00:41:07,507
Hmm?

457
00:41:15,368 --> 00:41:18,236
Let's go, boys.

458
00:41:19,071 --> 00:41:21,938
Careful now.

459
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:24,652
We want Eva.

460
00:41:24,777 --> 00:41:26,186
The one the Injuns marked up.

461
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:27,987
Well, you have to poke
another, she ain't here.

462
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,923
Where is the heathen bitch?

463
00:41:30,048 --> 00:41:31,280
I don't know.

464
00:41:31,446 --> 00:41:33,116
I ain't seen her since
the train race.

465
00:41:35,487 --> 00:41:37,521
I know where to find her.

466
00:41:43,994 --> 00:41:46,462
Two peas in a pod.

467
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:53,177
I say we go get her now!

468
00:41:53,343 --> 00:41:54,637
Just get dressed.

469
00:41:57,222 --> 00:41:58,583
We didn't do nothin'!

470
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:00,685
Let him go!

471
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,053
We was just talkin'.

472
00:42:02,178 --> 00:42:03,688
Leave her alone.

473
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,647
No!

474
