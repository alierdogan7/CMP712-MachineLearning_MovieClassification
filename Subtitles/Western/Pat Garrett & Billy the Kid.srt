506
00:57:58,447 --> 00:58:00,722
Two's better than one.

507
00:58:02,767 --> 00:58:07,318
I answer only to the governor,
Mr. Norris and Mr. Howland.

508
00:58:13,247 --> 00:58:16,284
I heard talk on the trail
the Kid's in Mexico.

509
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,324
Don't figure to me.

510
00:58:19,687 --> 00:58:22,997
Most likely, he's trying to get
his old bunch together again.

511
00:58:39,007 --> 00:58:43,046
- Which way we going?
GARRETT: I'm going southwest.

512
00:58:44,127 --> 00:58:46,402
POE:
That would be the Chisum ranch.

513
00:58:46,887 --> 00:58:48,240
Chisum is a fine man.

514
00:58:49,327 --> 00:58:51,602
Country's gotta make a choice.

515
00:58:51,767 --> 00:58:55,840
Time's over for drifters and outlaws
and those who got no backbone.

516
00:58:56,447 --> 00:59:00,235
GARRETT: I'm gonna tell you this once.
I don't wanna have to say it again.

517
00:59:01,007 --> 00:59:03,805
This country's getting old,
I aim to get old with it.

518
00:59:04,727 --> 00:59:06,797
Now, the Kid don't want it that way.

519
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:10,004
He might be a better man for it.
I ain't judging.

520
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:12,556
But I don't want you explaining
nothing to me.

521
00:59:12,727 --> 00:59:16,925
I don't want you saying nothing about the
Kid and nobody else in my damn county.

522
00:59:36,247 --> 00:59:38,238
MAN:
Garrett to see you, Mr. Chisum.

523
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:41,717
- All right. Somebody else try him.
MAN: Yes, sir.

524
00:59:47,647 --> 00:59:50,798
CHISUM: Mescaleros stole
40 head of horses last week.

525
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:55,125
Yeah, I heard they was
off the reservation.

526
00:59:56,967 --> 00:59:59,925
Bonney tried to steal a few head
a couple of weeks ago.

527
01:00:00,087 --> 01:00:03,397
Well, he says you owe him
$500 back salary.

528
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:07,003
He rode for me.
I treated him just like any other man.

529
01:00:11,327 --> 01:00:15,002
Sheriff, tell me something.
Why did you ride all the way out here?

530
01:00:15,327 --> 01:00:18,842
- Thought maybe you'd heard something.
- I'll tell you what I heard.

531
01:00:19,487 --> 01:00:23,196
Billy the Kid is in Tascosa.
Billy the Kid is in Tombstone.

532
01:00:23,367 --> 01:00:27,360
Billy the Kid is in Mexico, Tularosa,
Socorro, White Oaks.

533
01:00:27,527 --> 01:00:32,043
And Billy the Kid is at my table
right at this moment...

534
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:36,280
...eating tacos and green chili peppers
with my niece, just like old times.

535
01:00:36,447 --> 01:00:39,678
- You staying for supper?
- No, thanks.

536
01:00:41,727 --> 01:00:43,319
CHISUM:
Mr. Poe?

537
01:00:45,487 --> 01:00:48,445
I... Yeah, yes, I could eat.

538
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:51,475
Fine. Bunkhouse is right behind
the large barn.

539
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:53,877
Men usually eat
when the cook lets them.

540
01:00:57,327 --> 01:01:01,036
Interesting meeting you, Mr. Poe.
Perhaps I'll see you again some time.

541
01:01:01,807 --> 01:01:03,604
Glad to be of service, Garrett.

542
01:01:03,967 --> 01:01:05,719
But don't overuse it.

543
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:11,325
I appreciate the loan.

544
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:17,878
You gonna get him?

545
01:01:57,847 --> 01:01:59,041
PACO:
My friend.

546
01:01:59,727 --> 01:02:02,639
<i>Buena suerte</i> until I see you.

547
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:05,323
Come to Mexico, Billy.

548
01:02:05,727 --> 01:02:07,797
People know you're here.

549
01:02:08,567 --> 01:02:10,000
I say this as a friend.

550
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:13,603
In old Mex he ain't gonna be nothing
but another drunken gringo...

551
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:17,316
...shitting out chili peppers
and waiting for nothing.

552
01:02:22,047 --> 01:02:24,322
It's got a good edge.

553
01:02:24,527 --> 01:02:26,006
<i>Gracias, amigo.</i>

554
01:02:26,687 --> 01:02:28,120
<i>Gracias.</i>

555
01:02:29,407 --> 01:02:32,365
There's a lot of land between here
and the border.

556
01:02:32,527 --> 01:02:34,165
And it's all Chisum's.

557
01:02:34,327 --> 01:02:38,002
Better keep those sheep moving,
or they're gonna end up on his table.

558
01:02:40,407 --> 01:02:43,126
I have no quarrel with Chisum.

559
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:45,477
It is an old war that is over.

560
01:02:45,647 --> 01:02:47,478
Let him alone...

561
01:02:48,207 --> 01:02:50,516
...and he will let you alone.

562
01:02:51,327 --> 01:02:53,477
Don't you believe it, my friend.

563
01:02:53,647 --> 01:02:55,842
I must believe it.

564
01:03:12,327 --> 01:03:14,283
MAN:
<i>Adiós,</i> Paco.

565
01:03:18,247 --> 01:03:20,761
You could leave, you could live in Mexico.

566
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:23,237
- Could you?
- Yeah.

567
01:03:23,407 --> 01:03:25,637
I could live anywhere.

568
01:03:25,807 --> 01:03:28,241
I could leave anywhere too.

569
01:03:31,367 --> 01:03:34,837
- Have you ever been to California?
- Not yet.

570
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,237
I ain't either.

571
01:03:38,007 --> 01:03:41,443
But they're sure pushing on me
to go somewhere.

572
01:03:43,367 --> 01:03:46,245
Yeah, your leaving would sure
give Garrett some size.

573
01:03:46,487 --> 01:03:50,196
I reckon he's given me
about all the time he can.

574
01:03:51,967 --> 01:03:55,243
Mexico might not be bad
for a couple of months.

575
01:03:56,327 --> 01:03:58,761
Depends on who you are.

576
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,123
I reckon.

577
01:04:42,367 --> 01:04:44,961
There's a lot of us who'd ride with you.

578
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:52,197
Mexico won't be so bad
for a few months.

579
01:04:53,447 --> 01:04:55,358
I guess that depends who you are.

580
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,524
But if I was y'all...

581
01:05:00,367 --> 01:05:02,801
...I'd be clearing out of here.

582
01:05:03,127 --> 01:05:06,164
Gonna be some hard times
coming down.

583
01:05:09,407 --> 01:05:12,399
Remember me to whoever rides by.

584
01:05:39,967 --> 01:05:43,437
GARRETT:
Boy, get some water for these horses.

585
01:05:46,527 --> 01:05:47,721
[SNORING]

586
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:01,357
LEMUEL: All right about the goddamn...
GARRETT: Hello there, Lemuel.

587
01:06:04,007 --> 01:06:09,127
Well, if it ain't the limb
of the law, Patrick J. Garrett.

588
01:06:09,287 --> 01:06:13,075
Your booze is under the bar,
where I always keep it.

589
01:06:13,407 --> 01:06:16,479
Shake it up, it's got a little oil on it.

590
01:06:21,047 --> 01:06:25,325
That's the fairest drink of whiskey
you'll ever throw lip over, boy.

591
01:06:27,607 --> 01:06:29,086
Know you around these parts?

592
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:33,087
I ain't ever rode through here before.

593
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:45,726
Don't seem the best way
to be tracking a man down.

594
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:48,481
They're already talking about you
in Lincoln.

595
01:06:53,327 --> 01:06:56,842
I calculate you ain't been there
in more than seven weeks.

596
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:07,644
When I want somebody
to keep time for me, I'll ask you.

597
01:07:13,887 --> 01:07:15,957
I'll stay here the night.

598
01:07:17,407 --> 01:07:21,559
You take that trail east, then south.
I'll pick you up in Roswell. Five days...

599
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,638
...six at the most.

600
01:07:29,367 --> 01:07:32,518
You might be able to find something
out there alone.

601
01:07:41,847 --> 01:07:43,963
POE:
Are you getting tired, Garrett?

602
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:47,804
Looks like you only got
a couple more days left in you.

603
01:07:49,087 --> 01:07:52,796
Yeah, <i>well...adiós.</i>

604
01:08:01,567 --> 01:08:03,285
You want yourself a woman?

605
01:08:06,847 --> 01:08:11,079
One come here from Albuquerque, run
a cathouse over there. Name is Bertha.

606
01:08:11,847 --> 01:08:16,796
Got an ass on her like a $40 cow,
and a tit.

607
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:19,720
I'd like to see that thing filled
full of tequila.

608
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:23,804
Say, you know something,
you can't beat that, can you?

609
01:08:57,207 --> 01:08:58,640
BILLY:
Howdy, ma'am.

610
01:08:58,807 --> 01:09:00,604
Mr. Horrell.

611
01:09:05,847 --> 01:09:08,998
- Hey, Tommy.
MRS. HORRELL: Billy.

612
01:09:09,527 --> 01:09:12,405
Didn't think we'd be getting to see you.

613
01:09:13,487 --> 01:09:17,275
I felt obliged to come
and pay my respects before moving on.

614
01:09:17,447 --> 01:09:19,244
HORRELL:
Sit down, Bill.

615
01:09:27,967 --> 01:09:30,720
You picked a fine time to come, Billy.

616
01:09:37,247 --> 01:09:39,807
I sure never figured on you
taking on the badge.

617
01:09:40,247 --> 01:09:44,126
Didn't figure on it myself.
I was just in town being sociable.

618
01:09:45,007 --> 01:09:48,443
Rode in from Seven Rivers
to watch you hang.

619
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:54,557
- Garrett swore me in when you lit out.
- Won't be having no ill talk at my table.

620
01:09:54,807 --> 01:09:56,286
Fill yourself, Billy.

621
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:05,403
Another fried pie?

622
01:10:05,967 --> 01:10:07,639
ALAMOSA BILL:
Don't mind if I do.

623
01:10:07,807 --> 01:10:10,241
Never tasted anything so good.

624
01:10:15,367 --> 01:10:17,085
Thank you, ma'am.

625
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,800
MRS. HORRELL:
Billy?

626
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:21,525
Tomato.

627
01:10:26,087 --> 01:10:29,636
I don't suppose you ran into
old Pat, did you, Billy?

628
01:10:31,047 --> 01:10:32,366
Can't say I did.

629
01:10:33,527 --> 01:10:36,439
He'll track you down, Billy, and get you.

630
01:10:37,127 --> 01:10:40,244
Pat Garrett's got more sand than most.

631
01:10:40,447 --> 01:10:43,120
Yeah, I'm outlawed, for sure.

632
01:10:43,287 --> 01:10:45,323
Old Alamosa here will see to that.

633
01:10:48,247 --> 01:10:52,445
It wasn't long ago, I was the law,
riding for Chisum.

634
01:10:52,807 --> 01:10:55,162
And old Pat was an outlaw.

635
01:10:58,847 --> 01:11:01,486
The law is a funny thing, ain't it?

636
01:11:10,247 --> 01:11:12,044
Well, we best get to it.

637
01:11:15,807 --> 01:11:19,322
HORRELL: Just got through putting up
that new cottonwood door.

638
01:11:19,487 --> 01:11:21,717
Used the old one for my son, John.

639
01:11:22,607 --> 01:11:25,201
He got into a shooting with Olin Carroll.

640
01:11:25,367 --> 01:11:27,278
He's buried out yonder there.

641
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:32,681
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Horrell.

642
01:11:33,687 --> 01:11:35,006
John was a good hand.

643
01:11:36,607 --> 01:11:38,325
Couldn't shoot, though.

644
01:11:43,207 --> 01:11:45,880
Harley, you and Lee give me a hand
with this door.

645
01:12:03,287 --> 01:12:06,677
ALAMOSA BILL: I don't suppose there's
any other way we could work this out?

646
01:12:12,447 --> 01:12:14,677
Well, let's get to it.

647
01:12:15,207 --> 01:12:16,799
Ten steps?

648
01:12:16,967 --> 01:12:19,003
Suits me.

649
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:21,078
You count them.

650
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:33,955
You ain't thought of another way,
have you?

651
01:12:35,687 --> 01:12:37,678
No, I can't come up with nothing.

652
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,478
Get to it.

653
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:49,884
One, two, three, four, five...

654
01:12:50,047 --> 01:12:52,356
...six, seven, eight...

655
01:13:11,607 --> 01:13:14,041
That wasn't 10, hoss.

656
01:13:15,647 --> 01:13:18,081
I never could count.

657
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:23,247
At least I'll be remembered.

658
01:14:20,367 --> 01:14:22,517
Howdy, old-timer.

659
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:27,360
You're wasting the best part of your day.

660
01:14:36,687 --> 01:14:38,245
Hello, Holly.

661
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:43,282
- Bit off your graze, ain't you?
- A bit.

662
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:48,444
HOLLY: Hell, everybody knows
he's looking for the Kid.

663
01:14:49,007 --> 01:14:51,475
Everybody knows the Kid
ain't in this territory.

664
01:14:51,647 --> 01:14:53,000
Nobody's seen him.

665
01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:56,079
Maybe he be outside there.
I wish he'd come get a drink.

666
01:14:56,247 --> 01:14:58,397
- Get himself a drink?
- Mm-hm.

667
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:01,560
Yeah. Well, I had mine.

668
01:15:01,807 --> 01:15:04,116
GARRETT:
No need to run off, Holly.

669
01:15:18,607 --> 01:15:21,167
He ain't out there, Pat.

670
01:15:23,047 --> 01:15:26,164
You boys shuck them gun belts.
Let them lay where they fall.

671
01:15:38,327 --> 01:15:41,478
- You boys carrying wages?
- What kind of wages do you mean?

672
01:15:41,967 --> 01:15:45,243
Well, any kind of wages.

up at Chamas.

For coldcocking you over at
