1
00:01:06,198 --> 00:01:09,914
Lord, you awaken our good man!

2
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:13,450
Though the night is made for loving,

3
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:16,540
and the day she comes too soon,

4
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:20,919
yet will guide them now a'roamin', boys,

5
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:25,112
by the light of the moon.

6
00:01:51,406 --> 00:01:55,317
Whether by chance or he be chosen,

7
00:01:55,994 --> 00:02:01,149
every man travels the Winter Highway
to either ruin or salvation.

8
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:07,686
Chance leads to death,
but the Chosen only need listen.

9
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:11,623
And so it was,

10
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:13,550
on this very spot,

11
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:17,314
in flame I crown

12
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:21,324
a boundless light and a robe
of exquisite whiteness.

13
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:25,216
The Angel Mathias spoke unto me:

14
00:02:26,206 --> 00:02:32,178
"Humble Servant, settle here,
for this is holy land."

15
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:37,345
"Sow crops, tend sheep,
and erect a house of worship,"

16
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:45,699
"and verily ye shall prosper,
for the Scepter of Power is in thy hand."

17
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,948
And yet, as I stand before
ye in sacred testimony,

18
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:09,802
I see unholiness creeping into the fold.

19
00:03:09,894 --> 00:03:15,794
As with the Lord, the work
of the Devil is never done.

20
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:27,650
Using God and your neighbors,
protects you from wandering

21
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:33,765
into the arms of Satan whose schemes,
whose machinations are never-ending.

22
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,720
We must hold fast and root-out
the false prophets.

23
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:46,184
And when the Devil approaches in
whatever cunning form he desires,

24
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,842
I shall strike him down
with the Sword of Righteousness

25
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,671
and set God's house in order.

26
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:07,717
Is anybody thirsty?

27
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:15,119
- Thank you.
- You're lucky I found you.

28
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:18,532
- Hey! Give us some, give us some.
- Smell that thing a mile away.

29
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:22,123
- You can have some if you like.
- Well, that is very kind of you.

30
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:32,666
- This your land?
- This is Holy Land.

31
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:36,925
I am the prophet Josiah
and I am God's steward upon it.

32
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:39,772
- We was just passing through.
- Trespassers.

33
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,755
- Oh, no, sir.
- No? Poachers, then.

34
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:46,915
No, carpenter by trade.
My brother Jacob here is under my care.

35
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,602
So, trespasser, poacher and carpenter,
a man of prodigious talent.

36
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:54,085
It not concern ya, it
don't concern ya, yeah?

37
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,025
What?

38
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,305
We've fallen on terribly hard times.

39
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:00,665
Wagon busted a wheel several days back,

40
00:05:00,888 --> 00:05:03,549
and then our horse he
just up and died on us.

41
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:04,314
That's terrible.

42
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:06,427
I'm headin' on up to Santa
Fe to meet my wife...

43
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:08,433
and was plannin' on paying you
for this lamb once we...

44
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:11,595
How exactly were you planning
on paying for that...

45
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,847
Sending the money to The Tree perhaps?

46
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,991
Or address it to The Great
Winds of the Prairie?

47
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,303
My wife is a relation to the Governor...

48
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:23,713
- Money is of no concern.
- The Governor?

49
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:27,777
The man, who by reputation, is as rich
as Croesus, and he's allowing

50
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:32,390
his relatives to walk around like vagabonds.
This is shocking to me.

51
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:34,173
- It's the truth.
- Uh, huh.

52
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:36,540
We are royalty, we are
royalty in these parts.

53
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:41,852
The Lord does not believe in actions
without consequences.

54
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:46,287
- You understand.
- It's just two sheep. This one here and one yesterday.

55
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:49,259
Stealing is a sin, where
you come from, is it not?

56
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:54,978
- Yes, it is.
- And what, pray tell, are the wages of sin?

57
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,511
- I do not recall.
- What about your idiot brother?

58
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:59,623
Does he recall the wages of sin?

59
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:03,109
I may not, but I would not
tell you 'though if I did.

60
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:06,599
Perhaps if you two thieves had paid
a little more attention in Sunday school,

61
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:11,286
and a little less time playing
Hide Your Finger in Your Sister's Cunt,

62
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,642
- you might know that.
- This is our camp, you are not welcome here.

63
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:17,877
I will destroy you.

64
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:24,356
Hush, Jacob, you silly, crippled fool.

65
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:30,664
For the wages of sin are... death.

66
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:37,684
Daniel!

67
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:52,349
That is good.

68
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:10,471
- Shit.
- Drink?

69
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:13,533
- You drink.
- I haven't eaten yet.

70
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:16,458
Double or quit.

71
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:22,740
All right.

72
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:24,576
Stop. There ya go. Here ya go.

73
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:25,207
- There?
- Um-huh!

74
00:07:25,214 --> 00:07:27,796
- Sure?
- Yeah!

75
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:34,405
- Finish the bottle.
- Ain't enough bullets.

76
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:36,783
- I'm tired of your tricks.
- Those are the rules.

77
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:40,669
- One squeeze, one miss, one drink.
- I'm not drinking anymore.

78
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,896
Just close your eyes.
Be a good woman and

79
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:50,129
do what your husband says to you.
Ready?

80
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:00,143
Put down that gun.

81
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,070
Let's see now, Charlie.

82
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:39,768
If I was travelin' from Tucumcari

83
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:42,388
to Santa Fe,

84
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:47,074
I reckon I'd go right through
that valley right there.

85
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:49,086
Don't you think?

86
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:20,779
Ramirez. Balance:

87
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:24,639
- Seven dollars.
- That's wrong.

88
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:29,503
- Are you questioning my dignity?
- No, no, just the amount.

89
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:34,852
We should have fourteen dollars in there,
and you are telling us we only have seven?

90
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:38,858
Huh! This establishment does
not operate as a courtesy.

91
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,721
- I provide protection, security.
- I thought them to be one in the same.

92
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:49,109
Sarah, I do not recall you ever

93
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,015
having any of your rates...

94
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:53,541
You better show my wife some respect.

95
00:09:53,603 --> 00:09:57,341
No, you'd best show me respect in my bank,

96
00:09:57,342 --> 00:10:01,080
lest Jerimiah over there
think you came to rob me.

97
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:09,652
You two, highfalutin couple, ain't ya?

98
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:13,453
Perhaps you should have read
your contract more thoroughly.

99
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:17,310
You can read, can't you?

100
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:21,273
A, B, C, D, E, F.

101
00:10:21,274 --> 00:10:22,943
Contract or no contract,

102
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:25,564
it is still ain't right
to take half our savings.

103
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:28,098
You start your own bank then.

104
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:30,013
Surely there's plenty of room

105
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:34,249
over there in that dirt
farm of yours, Miguel.

106
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,710
- Do you want your money?
- Sí.

107
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:45,405
Sí! Now that's better.

108
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:01,321
One, two, three,

109
00:11:04,683 --> 00:11:06,291
five,

110
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:10,515
six,

111
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,889
seven dollars.

112
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,392
Perhaps the ma'am would
care to try something on?

113
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:02,674
I have a newly refurbished
fitting room out back.

114
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:04,933
Why not?

115
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,984
Sarah, we're not here for clothes.

116
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:11,728
I just want to try it on, no harm in that.

117
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:13,757
No harm, indeed, this way.

118
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:22,897
- The bell if you require any assistance.
- Thank you.

119
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:24,897
My pleasure. Oh!

120
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:29,182
To protect your feminine skin.

121
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:50,358
If you'll excuse me for a moment,
I had some bad chili this morning.

122
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,642
Ain't it pretty?

123
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:13,345
I can't believe that cheap
bastard let me have that.

124
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,426
I'm a hard woman to say no to.

125
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:26,378
Look at that! Look at that!
It's all you.

126
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:32,706
Be careful with that!
Oh, wait! There we go. Take it easy!

127
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:37,865
Came all the way from Orser's Central Store.
It's something, huh?

128
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:46,584
All right! Turn it! Turn it!
Be gentle. Easy now.

129
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,765
Oh, yes, indeed.

130
00:14:53,913 --> 00:14:57,630
And let us keep it this
clean all the time. Yes?

131
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:01,081
Thank you. You may leave.

132
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,827
Well, first you bust the
wheel on your wagon,

133
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:44,544
naturally, you forgot to
bring a spare.

134
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:48,403
So you sat out on your horse,
you and your brother,

135
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,762
and then your horse dies.

136
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:57,055
A rattlesnake, colic,
black water, lightning.

137
00:16:57,974 --> 00:17:01,259
Jesus Christ, Ward, you got some bad luck.

138
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:06,315
I suspect it just gets worse from here.

139
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:11,091
Yeah, I reckon it does.

140
00:17:22,497 --> 00:17:25,602
How are you? How are
we all? Good day.

141
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:27,602
Morning.

142
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:32,355
Mr. Ramirez.

143
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:39,259
It's a pleasure to see that you and Sarah have
finally accepted our invitation to pray with us.

144
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:44,021
Oh, we're not here for the service.
May I speak with you for a moment?

145
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:46,066
Well, I...

146
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,829
I suppose so. For a moment.

147
00:17:49,864 --> 00:17:52,122
It's regarding your sheep.

148
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:54,335
My sheep?

149
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:58,430
They strayed on to our
land again and ate our crops.

150
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:03,716
That's a pretty bold accusation, sir.
How do you know they were my sheep?

151
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,886
I don't want to start a conflict here,
Mr. Josiah, but this is the second time...

152
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:12,266
I just asked you, did you speak to
these fleece strays?

153
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:16,321
Did you ask them from whence they came?
Who may be their shepherd?

154
00:18:16,322 --> 00:18:20,179
- Who else's stock would they be?
- I don't know, I didn't see them.

155
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,542
You're our only neighbor for miles.

156
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:29,114
Is that it? Because, as you can see,
I have a congregation waiting for me.

157
00:18:29,115 --> 00:18:33,021
I'd appreciate you keeping
your stock off my property, sir.

158
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:38,124
- It is the Lord's property, Señor Ramirez.
- But it's mine, too.

159
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:40,903
And I cannot afford
to lose anymore of my crops.

160
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:43,660
- You could build a fence.
- A fence?

161
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:49,520
Why don't you come inside with your wife
and feel for yourself

162
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:52,355
the searing power of the
veracity of the Lord?

163
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,072
Another day, perhaps.

164
00:18:56,767 --> 00:19:01,612
I will ask Him about this fence.
I'm curious as to his response.

165
00:19:02,544 --> 00:19:04,595
I'd appreciate that, sir.

166
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:08,627
May the Lord be with you.

167
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:28,528
safe in the arms of Jesus,

168
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:34,591
Safe on His gentle breast,

169
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:38,739
There by His love o'ershaded,

170
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:44,784
sweetly my soul shall rest.

171
00:19:56,793 --> 00:19:59,178
- Stay inside.
- I'm coming with you.

172
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,731
Jack.

173
00:20:23,393 --> 00:20:27,555
Ya know, a dog killin' ain't a crime
I'm obliged to pursue.

174
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:32,966
People killin', that's a different story.

175
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:35,752
We bought it, it was our property.

176
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,590
- I can sell you a new dog.
- You stay out of this.

177
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:42,011
- When did this occur?
- Last night.

178
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:47,286
Mr. Josiah had some
sheep stolen a while back.

179
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:51,186
Rustlers have been active
in the area as of late.

180
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:53,020
Could be more of their kind.

181
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:54,621
Rustlers?

182
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:57,761
- That killed our dog?
- So, you saw who done it?

183
00:20:57,762 --> 00:20:59,780
Not entirely, it was dark.

184
00:21:02,202 --> 00:21:06,181
- Then, how do you know?
- The law needs to make someone accountable.

185
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:09,145
Do I look like a dog killer catcher?

186
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:14,402
- You're the law.
- That I am. There ain't no more be said.

187
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:19,645
- That's it? That your investigation?
- Yep!

188
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,533
Get that stinkin' cur outta my office!

189
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:29,489
- No, you're going to do something.
- I said get it outta her now! Get it out!

190
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:33,535
Gracias. Gracias.

191
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:38,685
I don't trust him.

192
00:21:41,997 --> 00:21:44,977
I don't trust Mr. Josiah much either,

193
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:47,589
but I don't believe he's a violent man.

194
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,006
Especially not one to shoot a dog.
This is a wild country here.

195
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:54,289
It could have been anybody.

196
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:57,922
I'll square things up with Mr. Josiah.

197
00:21:57,923 --> 00:22:00,590
A little strife's not
uncommon among his neighbors.

198
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,866
I'm pregnant.

199
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:18,490
A child? We're not ready.

200
00:22:23,632 --> 00:22:25,475
And what did you think would happen?

201
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:33,098
Maybe next year would be better.

202
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:38,346
Well then, you should've been more careful.

203
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:32,420
Good morning, Mr. Josiah.

204
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:40,479
I have been awaiting your apology, Miguel.

205
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,130
On what grounds?

206
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:44,833
Sunday is the day for worship and rest.

207
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:48,983
And you raised matters of business
in full view of my congregation.

208
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:52,626
You insulted me, you insulted the Lord.

209
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:55,289
That was not my intention,
surely you know this?

210
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,267
Don't be a fool,
I'm giving you an opportunity.

211
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:03,346
Kneel and apologize before the Lord now.

212
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:08,360
I've been polite and respectful thus
far, and expect the same from you.

213
00:24:09,328 --> 00:24:13,018
Well, I've tried.
I've tried to embrace you,

214
00:24:14,314 --> 00:24:16,295
and bring you into the flock.

215
00:24:19,103 --> 00:24:21,987
But you have nothing but contempt
for me and my work.

216
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:27,681
How I would think you were jealous,
envious. Are you envious?

217
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:30,326
There is nothin you have that I want.

218
00:24:30,361 --> 00:24:33,789
Oh, I am married, purely, and I have
the love and devotion of my flock,

219
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,338
and you have...

220
00:24:38,105 --> 00:24:40,930
You have blight on the landscape, sir.

221
00:24:40,965 --> 00:24:44,455
I have just as much right
to be here as you.

222
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,564
If you could, you would take
all that we have,

223
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:53,819
All that we have worked for.
It is not your fault.

224
00:24:54,444 --> 00:24:59,977
From your birth... this greed,
this avarice of your nature.

225
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:05,060
You killed our dog, didn't you?

226
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:09,486
Mexicans have never been
lauded for their intelligence.

227
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:17,409
Now, you must go. Leave here,
the both of you. Vayanse, carajo.

228
00:25:39,425 --> 00:25:43,536
You Beast of the Earth,
you brown skinned bastard!

229
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:52,486
To hell with you.

230
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:01,023
Miguel?

231
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,523
Miguel?

232
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:06,524
Praise be the Lord.

233
00:28:13,017 --> 00:28:15,277
Haven't I to eat something now.

234
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:49,703
Mrs. Ramirez, good evening.

235
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,204
To what do I owe the pleasure?

236
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,847
Have you seen Miguel?

237
00:28:56,538 --> 00:28:59,229
No, not since Church.

238
00:28:59,231 --> 00:29:02,618
He went out into the field today
for work and never came home.

239
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,959
- Oh, well, have you tried the saloon?
- Yes.

240
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:10,112
- The Sheriff?
- He's worthless.

241
00:29:10,493 --> 00:29:14,068
- Has he done this kind of thing before?
- Never.

242
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:18,012
I only ask because certain
types of men are slaves

243
00:29:18,146 --> 00:29:19,688
to their lustful proclivities.

244
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:23,101
And many times I've seen
them leave their wives in the lurch

245
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,896
when responsibilities begin to mount.

246
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:29,063
- Miguel would never do that.
- It's just, ah...

247
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:33,814
You are a very, very,
beautiful woman, Sarah,

248
00:29:33,868 --> 00:29:38,692
and your husband ought to appreciate
what the Lord has given him.

249
00:29:38,753 --> 00:29:42,445
- He does.
- I know I would.

250
00:29:48,464 --> 00:29:50,854
Good night.

251
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,036
May the Lord go with you.

252
00:30:30,267 --> 00:30:36,109
Cornelius Jackson, Santa Fe señoritas
ain't wild enough for ya?

253
00:30:46,615 --> 00:30:48,765
Nice dancing, Fancy Pants.

254
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:38,614
You have been officially
relieved of your duties.

255
00:31:39,145 --> 00:31:40,645
By what authority?

256
00:31:41,008 --> 00:31:44,634
- The Governor.
- But I done nothing.

257
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:47,454
- Well, at least you know why I'm here.
- This is my house.

258
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:51,307
It's the government's house,
you've been residing in it as a guest.

259
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:55,579
- Now you must leave.
- Go scrub your ass with a cactus brush!

260
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:02,065
Bastard son of a bitch!

261
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:15,625
- Where am I supposed to go?
- That is not my concern.

262
00:32:15,626 --> 00:32:18,833
- I'm gonna find you, motherfu...
- Git! Git!

263
00:32:19,534 --> 00:32:20,928
I'm gettin' outta here.

264
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:15,201
Yes? You want something?

265
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,984
- I've been relieved.
- I can see that.

266
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:24,190
- By whom?
- Cornelius Jackson, damn bushwhacker.

267
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,756
I'm...

268
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:32,435
- I'm looking for work.
- Who are you?

269
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:37,483
- I don't understand.
- Who are you?

270
00:33:38,218 --> 00:33:43,374
- Sorry?
- Without a badge, what purpose do you serve.

271
00:33:44,872 --> 00:33:46,741
I, ah...

272
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:53,974
- I cooked for a spell in the army.
- I have wives, I'm in no need of a cook.

273
00:33:55,388 --> 00:33:58,909
He shot my god damned hand.

274
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:02,046
My god damned hand!

275
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:14,190
Gentlemen, I am honored
to have you with me tonight,

276
00:37:14,892 --> 00:37:17,517
to welcome the
newest member of our community.

277
00:37:19,387 --> 00:37:22,207
Like so many great lawmen of our day,

278
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:25,429
his unbending reputation precedes him.

279
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,843
God made laws to govern men.

280
00:37:29,155 --> 00:37:32,158
Without men
to enforce those laws,

281
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,070
the terrors of evil would march unmolested

282
00:37:36,196 --> 00:37:40,120
- across the scorched plains of the earth, and...
- Salt, please.

283
00:37:45,074 --> 00:37:50,705
And mankind would run amok
like so many godless savages.

284
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,678
So! Raise your glasses please.

285
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,700
And let us thank God for
Sheriff Cornelius Jackson.

286
00:38:02,357 --> 00:38:04,009
Enjoy.

287
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:11,007
- Mighty fine table, Prophet.
- Well, thank you, Hugh, it's mahogany wood

288
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,529
all the way from British Honduras.

289
00:38:14,594 --> 00:38:16,686
On the Caribbean Sea.

290
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,092
South of Mexico.

291
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:26,136
- Sheriff.
- Give me some wine, please?

292
00:38:28,174 --> 00:38:30,370
Pass it along, please.

293
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:34,871
- So, did you manage to...
- Butter, please.

294
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:43,153
- How was your ride out here this evening?
- Why did you leave the Utah Territory?

295
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:47,973
I am God's humble servant, sir,
where He leads, I will follow.

296
00:38:48,074 --> 00:38:50,803
Did you bring your wives and
daughters down with you?

297
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:57,449
Only one woman shares my bed, Sheriff.

298
00:38:57,623 --> 00:38:59,706
Safer that way, that's for sure.

299
00:39:07,883 --> 00:39:09,371
China.

300
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:14,196
- Bone China, imported from England.
- China from England.

301
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:17,143
You ever fuck a sheep?

302
00:39:18,612 --> 00:39:20,835
Ya know, lot's of sheep
farmers fuck their sheep.

303
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:23,078
Isn't that how syphilis started?

304
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:28,182
The penis is a vile weapon, and I've
often thought of it as the devil's cutlass.

305
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:32,247
- Really now?
- So, what brings you to

306
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:34,511
our fine town, Sheriff Jackson?

307
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:37,151
- Geography.
- Geography?

308
00:39:37,152 --> 00:39:38,921
Yes, geography.

309
00:39:39,325 --> 00:39:42,256
Turns out our governor's
favorite cousin Lucille,

310
00:39:42,327 --> 00:39:46,964
went off and married a down and out
carpenter named Levi from Tucumcari.

311
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:50,654
That poor guy couldn't hit a nail
over the head with a tree trunk.

312
00:39:51,565 --> 00:39:55,473
Well, Lucille and Levi fell on
hard times, so the Governor

313
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:58,664
tells them that they should come and live
with him and his wife in Santa Fe,

314
00:39:58,665 --> 00:40:00,766
he'll even send train tickets.

315
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,344
Great man, our governor.

316
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:06,901
So, Lucille takes a train
on up to Santa Fe,

317
00:40:07,224 --> 00:40:09,506
while her husband, Levi, while being

318
00:40:09,691 --> 00:40:13,163
too prideful to accept the
Governor's largess of a few train tickets

319
00:40:13,268 --> 00:40:17,044
decides to travel by way of a
buckboard with his brother Jacob.

320
00:40:17,768 --> 00:40:22,560
Only Jacob and Levi
ain't no Kit Carsons.

321
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:25,957
And that's why I'm here.

322
00:40:27,182 --> 00:40:28,500
Geography.

323
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:34,371
Pardon me, Sheriff, but,
I don't understand.

324
00:40:34,637 --> 00:40:37,882
Mr. Josiah knows what I'm
talkin' about, don't you Josie?

325
00:40:37,883 --> 00:40:42,098
Tables from Honduras, china
from England, Salt Lake City...

326
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,194
you know all about geography.

327
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:53,211
No, I'm afraid, Sheriff,

328
00:40:53,424 --> 00:40:55,639
you've lost me completely.

329
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,359
May I borrow your knife?

330
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:04,251
No, no, that big one there behind you.

331
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,252
Geography.

332
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,980
Tucumcari.

333
00:41:31,044 --> 00:41:32,674
Santa Fe.

334
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:38,874
Right in the middle here,
you got the Holy Land.

335
00:41:42,853 --> 00:41:46,518
Now, Jacob and Levi woulda had
to travel straight through here

336
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:48,236
to get from Tucumcari...

337
00:41:50,522 --> 00:41:51,995
to Santa Fe.

338
00:41:52,082 --> 00:41:54,532
All Lucille and Governor
want to know is why Levi

339
00:41:54,623 --> 00:41:56,320
and his brother never showed up.

340
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:03,174
You done with that?

341
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,519
There's a dog outside there looks
like he's missin' a couple o' meals.

342
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,618
- Thank you kindly, Josie... damned good meat.
- Sheriff.

343
00:42:15,855 --> 00:42:20,966
I lead a God fearing, peaceful,
and united community here.

344
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:25,661
And I'm quite sure you do not want
to make me your enemy.

345
00:42:25,686 --> 00:42:28,618
It seems like I already have.

346
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:43,152
How are you, Sheriff?

347
00:42:45,457 --> 00:42:47,587
Got me a new job.

348
00:42:56,833 --> 00:43:00,371
- 'Scuse me.
- Good morning, ma'am.

349
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:05,190
- Your horse is drinking outta my trough.
- That appears to be the case.

350
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:07,781
Well, there's a creek right over there where
it can drink until its heart's content.

351
00:43:07,782 --> 00:43:10,628
I don't think Charlie
was aware of that fact.

352
00:43:10,643 --> 00:43:14,156
Ya know, when he's thirsty,
he kinda goes where he wants to.

353
00:43:14,555 --> 00:43:16,463
I didn't think your horse would mind much.

354
00:43:16,604 --> 00:43:19,248
Well, I do, so, like, ask first.

355
00:43:19,334 --> 00:43:22,742
Well, you're absolutely right, ma'am,
but Charlie's ignorant

356
00:43:22,743 --> 00:43:25,300
of such formalities as the human race.

357
00:43:25,842 --> 00:43:28,208
So, please accept my
apologies on his behalf.

358
00:43:28,244 --> 00:43:31,087
- My name's Sheriff Cornelius Jackson.
- I know who you are.

359
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:33,672
I think I should be flattered?

360
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:38,029
- You hung my father.
- Pardon me, ma'am,

361
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:40,870
but I've never hung anyone.
They sorta hang themselves.

362
00:43:41,216 --> 00:43:43,701
Is that what you tell yourself
to ease your conscience?

363
00:43:43,736 --> 00:43:45,632
The judges sentence the guilty.

364
00:43:45,935 --> 00:43:49,163
I either shoot 'em or arrest
'em, dependin' on the circumstances.

365
00:43:49,164 --> 00:43:50,796
That's untrue.

366
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:54,922
- Who was your father?
- Wesley Parker.

367
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,070
Wesley, Wesley Parker.

368
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,441
- So your mother would be...
- Yes, she would be.

369
00:44:04,806 --> 00:44:08,187
- And that would make you...
- Mrs. Sarah Ramirez.

370
00:44:11,364 --> 00:44:15,961
That's enough about the past.
I'm looking for these two men.

371
00:44:16,024 --> 00:44:19,222
Levi and Jacob Webb, they woulda passed by
these parts a couple of weeks ago.

372
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,329
- Haven't seen 'em.
- What about your husband?

373
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,420
- He's not here.
- When do you expect his return.

374
00:44:26,155 --> 00:44:27,768
Soon.

375
00:44:30,509 --> 00:44:36,205
Well, appears Charlies's had his fill.
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

376
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:39,172
And if you do happen to Jacob and Levi,

377
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:42,863
please find it in your kind heart
to offer them some water.

378
00:44:43,585 --> 00:44:45,910
I'm sure they're terribly thirsty by now.

379
00:44:59,591 --> 00:45:04,806
Good afternoon, Mrs. Ramirez.
Any word from Miguel?

380
00:45:05,004 --> 00:45:08,388
- Do you see him?
- No, I do not.

381
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,105
Sarah, have I done something to offend you?

382
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:21,301
- You make me uneasy.
- Well, I assure you, that is not my intention.

383
00:45:21,314 --> 00:45:24,832
- This Killjoy is here to help you.
- How so?

384
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,957
How do you intend to
get by without your husband?

385
00:45:29,071 --> 00:45:33,232
- I've managed thus far.
- And admirably so, but,

386
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:37,827
I fear he has abandoned you and
you will not survive on your own.

387
00:45:38,107 --> 00:45:41,910
- It hasn't beaten me yet.
- It will, Sarah, it will.

388
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:45,188
- Then let it.
- Give the Church your land.

389
00:45:45,672 --> 00:45:48,872
And let the Lord's relieve
you of this burden.

390
00:45:49,448 --> 00:45:53,909
The Lord desires this
land to be part of something larger.

391
00:45:54,154 --> 00:45:56,569
A great holy community.

392
00:45:58,226 --> 00:46:03,193
And I come to you, with
kindness and charity in my heart,

393
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:07,766
to offer you the opportunity
to prosper, to take refuge in

394
00:46:08,605 --> 00:46:11,869
- the bosom of Christ.
- And where would I go?

395
00:46:12,384 --> 00:46:14,078
With me.

396
00:46:14,112 --> 00:46:15,727
I will bring you to Holy Land.

397
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:20,462
I will provide for you,
and take care of you in every way.

398
00:46:20,998 --> 00:46:22,582
Sounds like hell.

399
00:46:22,595 --> 00:46:24,728
Just as stubborn as her husband.

400
00:46:24,738 --> 00:46:28,279
My guess is she'll be whorin' again
in no time, just like her mother.

401
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,184
- Get off my property.
- Sarah.

402
00:46:30,242 --> 00:46:32,294
By law it's still the bank's.

403
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:34,409
Another word out of you
and there'll be no more bank.

404
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:37,953
Hugh... now...

405
00:46:38,118 --> 00:46:40,479
you spoke out of turn and intemperately,

406
00:46:40,556 --> 00:46:43,592
and you will apologize
towards Sarah, right now.

407
00:46:44,024 --> 00:46:46,875
I sincerely apologize.

408
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:52,516
Sarah, there's no need for violence.
Violence is never the answer.

409
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,216
Don't.

410
00:46:54,342 --> 00:46:58,344
I come here to do God's work, to help you,

411
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:03,084
and I know that you do not want to harm me.

412
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,801
Isn't that a bit better?

413
00:47:14,528 --> 00:47:18,194
I have washed away your sins, Sarah.

414
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:20,589
You are a member of the white race.

415
00:47:20,683 --> 00:47:23,441
You should never have married
a man with cursed blood.

416
00:47:25,686 --> 00:47:28,497
But that is behind us.

417
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,305
I will make you happy.

418
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:36,438
You will see. But you
will come to understand,

419
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:43,979
through me is heaven.

420
00:47:50,725 --> 00:47:54,638
Sowing in the morning,
sowing seeds of kindness.

421
00:47:55,176 --> 00:47:59,552
Sowing in the noontide
and the dewy eve;

422
00:47:59,851 --> 00:48:04,422
Waiting for the harvest,
and the time of reaping...

423
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:56,989
Josiah, the Messiah.
Evening, Mr. Enemy.

424
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,805
What are you doing in my house, Sheriff?

425
00:51:01,926 --> 00:51:06,161
Well, these two fine gentlemen invited me
over here for a little wine tasting.

426
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:10,122
- And who might they be?
- Trespassers.

427
00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:12,859
- On who's land?
- Yours.

428
00:51:14,878 --> 00:51:16,676
I see.

429
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,619
Could you bring that light over here?

430
00:51:34,068 --> 00:51:35,735
Levi and Jacob.

431
00:51:38,163 --> 00:51:42,924
Does that look like him,
after a rough night?

432
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:48,285
- So, who killed 'em?
- One cold-blooded son of a bitch.

433
00:51:48,888 --> 00:51:51,678
- Highwaymen?
- Have you seen any?

434
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:54,575
There's no shortage of miscreants
in this world, Sheriff.

435
00:51:54,876 --> 00:51:59,736
- No truer statement have I ever heard.
- What are you doing in my house?

436
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,313
May I borrow your knife again?

437
00:52:06,726 --> 00:52:10,606
So, here's what I've put together,
feel free to disagree at any time.

438
00:52:11,614 --> 00:52:15,317
Jacob here was clearly stabbed... I think
it's Jacob, it's hard to tell 'em apart...

439
00:52:15,484 --> 00:52:21,482
was stabbed with a large knife.
Now let's just try...

440
00:52:23,903 --> 00:52:28,053
Well, whaddya know?
Almost a near perfect fit.

441
00:52:29,216 --> 00:52:32,910
I reckon whoever stabbed him
must've had a knife just like yours.

442
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:37,960
It's a very popular model, Sheriff.
Sears Roebuck sells them by the trainload.

443
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:42,591
Post me one of them
cartridges outta your gun, would ya?

444
00:52:43,804 --> 00:52:47,387
- Out of my gun?
- Unless you got somethin' to hide.

445
00:52:55,475 --> 00:52:58,680
- 45?
- Colt.

446
00:52:58,681 --> 00:53:01,505
- It don't look factory made.
- We take pride in doing

447
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:03,669
things for ourselves around here.

448
00:53:04,597 --> 00:53:06,073
I can see that.

449
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:08,840
Now, Levi over here...

450
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:12,174
he was wounded in the leg
by a pistol or a rifle bullet.

451
00:53:12,206 --> 00:53:15,449
Then perhaps, as he
was limpin' away, Levi. gets

452
00:53:15,694 --> 00:53:17,694
his guts blown out by a scatter gun.

453
00:53:19,005 --> 00:53:21,716
Oh, you got a visitor? Oh, hi there.

454
00:53:21,717 --> 00:53:24,428
Is that Daniel? Come on
in here, join the party.

455
00:53:24,883 --> 00:53:27,821
Well, we got a knife wound,
we got a large caliber bullet,

456
00:53:27,911 --> 00:53:31,567
probably a 45, and a scattergun,
which leads me to believe that

457
00:53:31,657 --> 00:53:35,369
this was the work of
at least two killers.

458
00:53:35,433 --> 00:53:37,923
- Is that about right?
- If you say so.

459
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,809
I'm glad you could join us, Daniel.

460
00:53:39,818 --> 00:53:42,644
Me and your bishop here we just
trying to figure a few things out.

461
00:53:42,646 --> 00:53:45,259
I bet you could help us.
Do you care to make a statement?

462
00:53:46,614 --> 00:53:48,605
Make a statement about what?

463
00:53:50,232 --> 00:53:53,573
Life, liberty,

464
00:53:56,003 --> 00:53:58,694
- the pursuit of happiness.
- Sheriff Jackson,

465
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:01,737
if you have concluded this grim charade

466
00:54:02,474 --> 00:54:07,000
and making your absurd and, frankly,
your deeply offensive accusations,

467
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:08,768
I would appreciate if you got these

468
00:54:08,769 --> 00:54:11,974
stinking, fucking corpses out of my house.

469
00:54:12,564 --> 00:54:15,571
- Twenty dollars.
- What?

470
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:18,916
Make that twenty-five.
Yeah, twenty-five.

471
00:54:19,265 --> 00:54:21,912
I hold the intent the deaths of
these young men are tragic...

472
00:54:21,947 --> 00:54:27,300
- Murders! Murders! It's an important distinction.
- I would like to know if you have...

473
00:54:27,426 --> 00:54:29,367
Let's make it an even thirty.

474
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:31,867
I'd like to at least have
them buried in suits.

475
00:54:31,908 --> 00:54:36,626
Because if you do not have an warrant,
you are in my house illegally.

476
00:54:36,627 --> 00:54:38,129
Think these poor fellas
have ever worn a suit?

477
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:40,808
You are in fact, trespassing.

478
00:54:40,851 --> 00:54:44,308
And I have asked you, as
politely as I can

479
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:47,306
to leave. Now.

480
00:54:47,627 --> 00:54:51,711
Please send Levi and Jacob post haste
to this address here in Santa Fe.

481
00:54:53,493 --> 00:54:55,532
I deeply appreciate it.

482
00:55:06,133 --> 00:55:11,635
- You are a queer man.
- Unusual, opt for unusual.

483
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,010
Never queer.

484
00:55:21,453 --> 00:55:23,943
You make sure he leaves.

485
00:55:34,728 --> 00:55:39,927
Shame, he shames me, shames me in my house.

486
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:46,257
And you allow it. Why? Why?
Why do you allow him to shame me?

487
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,220
I shamed you.
Never would I have this...

488
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,714
He shames me, twice he shames me,

489
00:55:56,715 --> 00:55:59,779
and you were... nothing...
I listen, I listen to

490
00:55:59,782 --> 00:56:04,358
everything you told me... Why? Why?

491
00:56:04,393 --> 00:56:07,570
Am I not your
holy, obedient Son.

492
00:56:07,576 --> 00:56:12,384
And you see to repay me in this faith...
And this, and this...

493
00:56:13,217 --> 00:56:14,173
No!

494
00:58:19,036 --> 00:58:21,269
It really stinks, ya know.

495
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,546
Can ya help me get them outta here?

496
00:58:30,661 --> 00:58:31,896
On your knees.

497
00:58:33,723 --> 00:58:36,609
Toss your gun aside. Slowly.

498
00:58:45,611 --> 00:58:47,732
Is that my husband?

499
00:58:49,994 --> 00:58:51,749
- Is that my husband?
- I didn't kill him, ma'am.

500
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,619
I swear I had nothing to do with set-up...

501
00:58:53,654 --> 00:58:55,457
No, I swear I had nothing to do with it.

502
00:58:55,602 --> 00:58:57,018
- You got the wrong man.
- Shut up.

503
00:58:57,019 --> 00:58:58,746
It was the Prophet Josiah, he killed him.

504
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,286
No! No! We just came out here to dig up the body so
we could take him back to the house and burn it.

505
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:04,408
Shut your fuckin' mouth.

506
00:59:16,106 --> 00:59:19,560
Allow God's true expression
of your feelings.

507
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:24,382
Curly, come on, Curly, are you angry?
You must be angry. Be angry.

508
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:28,232
Look at me. You humiliated me.
Are you angry? Are you angry?

509
00:59:28,461 --> 00:59:32,532
- I'm angry, I'm angry.
- Good. Good. What thoughts you have?

510
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:36,715
It is in your heart
of God's pure, divine truth

511
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,302
to come searing through you
and speak, hold nothing back.

512
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,625
- I have a thought.
- You have a thought, good.

513
00:59:42,113 --> 00:59:44,785
I wanna know when we was
gonna get our wives.

514
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,479
You said we was all gonna
have wives when we came...

515
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,820
Jesus is your trouble.
You're ruled by your beastly desires.

516
00:59:51,346 --> 00:59:53,942
Think through here, not through the...

517
00:59:54,563 --> 00:59:57,451
I will bring wives to
you when you are ready.

518
00:59:57,908 --> 01:00:01,594
You should remove this
puss-filled sack of distraction.

519
01:00:01,613 --> 01:00:03,729
What do you think? No? No?

520
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:09,444
Can you allow God's love in your heart?
Can you control your mortal desires?

521
01:00:09,479 --> 01:00:11,872
Can you? Can you?

522
01:00:17,298 --> 01:00:21,093
You know why I teach you these things?
You understand?

523
01:00:22,517 --> 01:00:23,841
You know I love you.

524
01:00:24,972 --> 01:00:27,399
I know you do, Prophet.

525
01:00:43,191 --> 01:00:45,539
Found Sid and Daniel's
ponies out by the woods.

526
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:47,313
Somethin' must've spooked 'em.

527
01:00:47,335 --> 01:00:49,526
Give me one of the boys
and I'll go back and find 'em.

528
01:00:50,657 --> 01:00:55,468
No, go right into town,
see if they've been arrested.

529
01:00:55,503 --> 01:00:59,273
- Why would they be arrested?
- The Sheriff's a lunatic.

530
01:01:36,801 --> 01:01:41,121
My little painted lady.
My fallen angel.

531
01:01:50,203 --> 01:01:52,664
Miguel's been murdered.

532
01:01:54,157 --> 01:01:56,878
God does not protect the weak.

533
01:02:02,773 --> 01:02:04,145
I came to say goodbye.

534
01:02:06,446 --> 01:02:08,805
I thought we already
did that seven years ago.

535
01:02:09,205 --> 01:02:12,344
Something about you not
wanting your husband

536
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,704
or your children exposed to my sinful ways.

537
01:02:16,618 --> 01:02:19,136
But they were also your ways, too, Sarah.

538
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:23,046
Seven times a virgin, were you now?

539
01:02:24,415 --> 01:02:26,948
Did you think you could start over?

540
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:32,096
The evil on the blessing
will reach us all, my child.

541
01:02:36,227 --> 01:02:39,352
I'm not ashamed of you anymore.

542
01:02:40,766 --> 01:02:42,525
I pity you.

543
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,888
You think I'm unhappy?

544
01:02:54,574 --> 01:02:56,380
I don't think much about it.

545
01:02:58,486 --> 01:03:02,891
I forgive you, mother, for everything.

546
01:03:06,645 --> 01:03:09,252
You have no influence over me.
You never have.

547
01:03:13,272 --> 01:03:17,029
Everything you've ever
done is because of me.

548
01:03:26,128 --> 01:03:30,441
So, do it well, do it well, my child.

549
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:15,033
We're making house calls again, are we?

550
01:04:16,805 --> 01:04:19,722
Sportin' life always fit you well, Sarah.

551
01:04:19,723 --> 01:04:22,315
I've come for my seven dollars.

552
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:27,675
Seven dollars to play my flute?

553
01:04:28,842 --> 01:04:31,101
I won't pay a penny over a dollar.

554
01:04:33,899 --> 01:04:36,694
Even if you do rub my balls.

555
01:04:39,538 --> 01:04:42,809
Looks like you'll be visitin' me all week.

556
01:04:47,522 --> 01:04:49,713
Just like old times.

557
01:05:06,356 --> 01:05:10,196
- Is Martin in?
- He's out back, had to run to the privy.

558
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:23,670
- Would you see that he gets this?
- Absolutely, ma'am.

559
01:05:25,145 --> 01:05:27,041
How ya doin', honey?

560
01:05:27,042 --> 01:05:28,937
<i>Fine, Grandma.</i>

561
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:36,486
- Where did say Martin was?
- Out back usin' the privy.

562
01:05:42,331 --> 01:05:46,320
Show me that pretty face.
Oh.. oh...

563
01:05:46,389 --> 01:05:49,410
Yeah... oh...

564
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:54,344
- It feels good in the ass, don't it?
- No, no, it hurts.

565
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:07,155
What in the hell are you doing back here?

566
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:10,796
My little granddaughter was
tryin' on a dress in the back room,

567
01:06:11,096 --> 01:06:14,323
and then there was a loud gunshot
and then there was a loud crash,

568
01:06:14,324 --> 01:06:17,551
and Martin's head busted through the wall.

569
01:06:22,629 --> 01:06:26,160
Well, you're just nothin' but
a dirty old dog, aren't ya?

570
01:06:26,195 --> 01:06:29,362
- He got what he deserved.
- He certainly did.

571
01:06:29,424 --> 01:06:33,801
- Anyone else in the store with you?
- A young woman came in, asked for Martin,

572
01:06:34,105 --> 01:06:36,843
then pulled some cartridge
boxes of the shelf,

573
01:06:37,112 --> 01:06:41,068
laid some money on the counter
and then left right before the big bang.

574
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:45,904
Strawberry hair, purple dress,
all painted up, about thirty years of age?

575
01:06:47,225 --> 01:06:50,451
- Yes, very polite.
- That's interesting.

576
01:06:51,136 --> 01:06:55,505
A woman fitting that description,
been leavin' bodies all over town today.

577
01:06:58,744 --> 01:07:01,014
I've gotta perform a little procedure here.

578
01:07:02,124 --> 01:07:03,474
May want to avert your eyes.

579
01:07:03,926 --> 01:07:05,726
- Sheriff, right here?
- I don't know.

580
01:07:05,727 --> 01:07:09,433
- Is this necessary?
- I don't want the body gettin' no harder.

581
01:07:10,105 --> 01:07:13,143
Then it's like cuttin'
through a piece of firewood.

582
01:07:13,144 --> 01:07:17,798
You ever tried cutting
firewood with a knife? It don't chop.

583
01:07:24,351 --> 01:07:27,047
There's a surprise for you, little girl.

584
01:07:29,169 --> 01:07:31,915
- Can you do me a favor?
- Okay.

585
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:34,306
- Just hold my coat for one minute.
- Okay.

586
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:35,904
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

587
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:43,779
Let's see now.

588
01:07:45,965 --> 01:07:49,098
Well, I ain't no surgeon,

589
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:50,574
but,

590
01:07:51,573 --> 01:07:55,405
I guess that the bullet

591
01:07:57,061 --> 01:08:00,074
would be

592
01:08:02,308 --> 01:08:05,387
right about

593
01:08:07,389 --> 01:08:08,648
here.

594
01:08:09,181 --> 01:08:12,510
There, I got it. I got it.

595
01:08:14,727 --> 01:08:16,840
See.

596
01:08:17,957 --> 01:08:21,493
When a member of the white race,
who is of the chosen seed,

597
01:08:21,755 --> 01:08:25,677
mixes their blood with the seed of Cain

598
01:08:25,678 --> 01:08:29,172
a member of the African race, or...

599
01:08:29,727 --> 01:08:34,002
- Any other heathen.
- Any other dark skinned heathens,

600
01:08:34,995 --> 01:08:37,040
The penalty under the law of God is

601
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,323
death on the spot.

602
01:08:40,442 --> 01:08:42,912
And it will always be so.

603
01:08:55,612 --> 01:08:59,738
The Sheriff ain't arrestin' nobody.
Someone killed Hugh and Martin.

604
01:09:00,354 --> 01:09:02,641
- Where?
- In town.

605
01:09:03,475 --> 01:09:06,765
- Was it a robbery?
- I don't believe so.

606
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:11,057
- What did the Sheriff say?
- He's not sayin' much.

607
01:09:11,136 --> 01:09:13,767
Word is that it was the
woman whore what done it.

608
01:09:13,768 --> 01:09:15,872
What other kind of whore is there?

609
01:09:17,104 --> 01:09:18,792
Saddle-up the horses.

610
01:09:55,886 --> 01:09:58,176
Let's see how much you weigh.

611
01:09:59,498 --> 01:10:02,460
You look like the right God out there.

612
01:10:26,635 --> 01:10:30,705
Josiah would not approve.

613
01:10:31,116 --> 01:10:32,954
Josiah ain't here.

614
01:11:04,115 --> 01:11:07,526
Howdy, ma'am, do you need
any help with your wash?

615
01:11:37,569 --> 01:11:40,713
Oh, God.

616
01:12:17,147 --> 01:12:20,485
- Mornin', hello, Sheriff.
- I need your help.

617
01:12:21,621 --> 01:12:24,423
I got these two bullets
that match up identical weights,

618
01:12:25,097 --> 01:12:28,985
we'll call them the Levi
and the Josie bullets.

619
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:31,778
- Who were they?
- Never mind the names.

620
01:12:31,887 --> 01:12:36,531
Now I got these two, let's call these
the banker and the store owner bullets.

621
01:12:36,734 --> 01:12:39,580
- They murdered Hugh and Martin.
- That's ain't important at this time.

622
01:12:39,677 --> 01:12:46,179
Now, the Levi bullet and the Josie bullet
are the same caliber and weight, 45, 250.

623
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:51,644
Banker and the store owner, same caliber
and weight, 44, 200.

624
01:12:53,278 --> 01:12:56,535
That's the limit of my
investigative abilities.

625
01:12:56,536 --> 01:12:59,470
Well, I could take it a
couple of steps further.

626
01:12:59,678 --> 01:13:02,587
Melt down bullets and tell
ya their exact composition.

627
01:13:02,588 --> 01:13:04,718
That might help ya determine
where they came from.

628
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:05,573
Yes, it would.

629
01:13:05,602 --> 01:13:07,775
And if you know where they came from,

630
01:13:07,776 --> 01:13:09,948
you might be able to trace
'em back to the killer.

631
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:11,377
How long will it take ya?

632
01:13:11,444 --> 01:13:13,976
Why don't ya come back in the
morning and I'll have it for ya.

633
01:13:21,747 --> 01:13:25,248
Who do we have left? Just Stu?

634
01:13:25,481 --> 01:13:28,885
- That's it.
- Where is he?

635
01:13:30,346 --> 01:13:32,709
Out fixin' the fence by the Flats.

636
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:47,494
So, the banker and the store owner
bullets are of identical composition.

637
01:13:47,846 --> 01:13:51,711
- Right.
- They're 97% lead and 3% tin.

638
01:13:51,805 --> 01:13:54,596
Standard factory made,
which is what I expected.

639
01:13:55,343 --> 01:13:59,330
But here's where it takes an
interesting turn, Levi and Josie bullets

640
01:13:59,363 --> 01:14:01,916
are also of identical
composition to one another.

641
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:07,197
But they're 95 % lead
and peculiarly 5% zinc,

642
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:10,919
leading me to believe these bullets
were not factory made, but were home made.

643
01:14:10,954 --> 01:14:15,296
- Why would you say that?
- 'Cause a factory would never use zinc in their moldings.

644
01:14:15,905 --> 01:14:20,049
Not only fouls up you pots,
but it makes for a fairly unsound bullet.

645
01:14:20,303 --> 01:14:23,465
Why would somebody use
zinc instead of tin?

646
01:14:23,566 --> 01:14:27,682
Probably run out of tin.
But there's loads of zinc around here.

647
01:14:27,744 --> 01:14:31,491
I reckon whoever poured the Levi
and Josie bullets is from these parts.

648
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,607
The final analysis is right there
in that invoice.

649
01:14:37,082 --> 01:14:40,465
- Good job.
- You need more, you just let me know.

650
01:14:40,699 --> 01:14:45,053
All right, I appreciate it.
Have a good day.

651
01:14:47,864 --> 01:14:52,851
- Did you get any leads on that woman?
- Well, let's just say I have my suspicions.

652
01:15:38,273 --> 01:15:41,199
I apologize for digin' you up, Mr. Ramirez.

653
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,654
I just tryin' to get to the bottom
of this bloodbath.

654
01:15:47,065 --> 01:15:51,789
I reckon we oughta get you
back in your resting place.

655
01:16:09,453 --> 01:16:12,855
Hey, Dan, you're dead!

656
01:16:16,604 --> 01:16:19,053
Looks like I'm at the wrong ranch.

657
01:16:26,864 --> 01:16:29,748
The Final Shaming is at hand.

658
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:36,249
Twice you shamed me, but now

659
01:16:36,923 --> 01:16:42,337
in the end, I shame you.
Now will hang there, in shame

660
01:16:42,607 --> 01:16:46,183
until the sun dries your
scrawny testicles into leather hide

661
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:49,774
and the ravens peck you apart.

662
01:16:55,545 --> 01:16:59,907
Thousands of pecks of shame,
what will they take first?

663
01:17:00,184 --> 01:17:03,945
Your eyeballs, they'll be pecked out
in shame, your ears, your nose

664
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:07,469
your tongue? All pecked out in shame,

665
01:17:07,971 --> 01:17:12,841
until the Devil reaches up
and he claims your rotten soul.

666
01:17:16,194 --> 01:17:18,767
The shamer has become the shamed.

667
01:17:19,406 --> 01:17:24,236
Now, I am the shamer,
and it feels good.

668
01:17:24,475 --> 01:17:28,356
Wait, Jo-Jo. I'm... I'm
a little bit confused.

669
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:31,593
Oh, I'm sorry, did I not
make myself quite clear?

670
01:17:31,861 --> 01:17:37,653
You are going to hang there
and you are going to fucking die.

671
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:40,372
Well, it's not exactly clear.
Ya see,

672
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:46,439
ya got Jews, you got your Muslims,
ya got the fat Chinaman with the big belly,

673
01:17:46,504 --> 01:17:49,197
hell, ya even got Injuns
with their Wakan Tanka

674
01:17:49,285 --> 01:17:53,970
so, what I gotta know is, especially
with all this crap you've been preaching...

675
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:55,715
Who's right?

676
01:17:56,535 --> 01:17:58,547
I am the Prophet Josiah.

677
01:17:59,899 --> 01:18:04,267
The Lord burns.
The Fire of Jehovah.

678
01:18:04,968 --> 01:18:11,668
And when the final trump sounds
it is I who will sit along side

679
01:18:12,022 --> 01:18:15,220
the Lord on his golden throne of glory.

680
01:18:16,255 --> 01:18:19,330
- And I alone...
- Shame on you, Shamer!

681
01:18:19,621 --> 01:18:24,166
- Let's go cut yourselves a whore.
- Shame on you shamer!

682
01:18:25,452 --> 01:18:30,219
Shame on the shamer!
What the hell are you doin' over there?

683
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:34,068
Oh, my, my my. My, my, my.

684
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:41,758
Fuck you.

685
01:18:44,949 --> 01:18:48,419
Ladies, would you like
to hear a verse of Lord Byron?

686
01:18:49,514 --> 01:18:54,777
I would I were a careless child,
Still dwelling in the Highland cave,

687
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,313
Or roaming through the dusky wild...

688
01:19:58,197 --> 01:20:02,596
You're just a dirty whore!
You're the Devil's Harlot!

689
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:05,626
You Bitch of Satan!

690
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:11,735
I suppose I am.

691
01:20:28,995 --> 01:20:32,913
Hey, go easy there, Darlin',
I can't feel my legs no more.

692
01:20:44,405 --> 01:20:46,752
Thank you.

693
01:20:52,338 --> 01:20:53,569
You're on your own.

694
01:21:54,102 --> 01:21:56,502
Oh! Oh! Please don't, ma'am.

695
01:21:56,903 --> 01:21:57,723
Oh, no, oh...

696
01:23:30,955 --> 01:23:34,171
Sarah, you're safe now,
you've cleared the way.

697
01:23:34,206 --> 01:23:37,733
I see you restrained my wife.
No matter.

698
01:23:39,738 --> 01:23:42,939
They were a jealous bitches, it would never
have worked between them and us.

699
01:23:43,637 --> 01:23:46,369
They were mean spirited sinners,

700
01:23:46,977 --> 01:23:49,119
and you are, you are pure...

701
01:23:49,633 --> 01:23:52,356
and noble of heart, I
see that, I know that.

702
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:56,190
I did not see my daughter.

703
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:58,429
Is she dead?

704
01:23:59,045 --> 01:24:00,035
So be it.

705
01:24:00,813 --> 01:24:05,515
She isn't?
Well, you can teach her how to fuck.

706
01:24:06,553 --> 01:24:08,632
We both know how good you are at that.

707
01:24:12,104 --> 01:24:14,243
Sarah, come out.

708
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:22,125
Why would you hide?
Look, this is your house.

709
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,441
This is your land.

710
01:24:25,649 --> 01:24:28,421
There are no encumbrances to our union.

711
01:24:29,162 --> 01:24:31,905
You kill my wives,
I killed your husbands.

712
01:24:31,934 --> 01:24:33,953
We are not that dissimilar.

713
01:24:34,192 --> 01:24:35,010
Look!

714
01:24:36,477 --> 01:24:39,386
I'm placing my weapon down and enter...

715
01:24:40,487 --> 01:24:43,026
Entering the Spirit of Peace.

716
01:24:43,734 --> 01:24:46,322
Am falling before the Lord

717
01:24:47,611 --> 01:24:49,838
to solve our grievances.

718
01:24:52,069 --> 01:24:56,125
We can live together, Sarah,
a second chance.

719
01:24:58,236 --> 01:25:01,122
With peace, harmony, and happiness.

720
01:25:02,016 --> 01:25:03,223
Sarah.

721
01:25:11,663 --> 01:25:13,607
Oh, fuck it.

722
01:25:16,136 --> 01:25:17,385
Shut up.
