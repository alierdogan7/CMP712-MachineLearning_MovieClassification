01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,222
I've got it.
I know who it is.

1181
01:29:00,472 --> 01:29:03,475
I got it !

1182
01:29:03,475 --> 01:29:06,478
John Brown, you come on inside
And let me buy you a drink.

1183

[ whimpering ]

1184
01:29:15,487 --> 01:29:17,489
Goddamn it !

1185
01:29:19,992 --> 01:29:23,495
I really trusted her.
I really thought she loved me.

1186
01:29:33,505 --> 01:29:36,508
Brown, here's my bill.

1187
01:29:36,508 --> 01:29:40,011
You can pay it,
Or you can use it to wipe the pablum off your chin.

1188
01:29:40,012 --> 01:29:44,516
I'll pay it.
Don't make me no never mind. I'm in it for the sport.

1189
01:29:47,019 --> 01:29:49,521
I'm gonna give you
A rule of thumb.

1190
01:29:49,772 --> 01:29:54,777
You foller it, and
You might be able to hang on to this ranch of yours.

1191
01:29:55,778 --> 01:29:59,782
All large-scale crime
Is an inside job.

1192
01:29:59,915 --> 01:30:02,918
Running up and down the road
A-taking fingerprints...

1193
01:30:02,918 --> 01:30:05,420
And sending trash off
To the crime labs...

1194
01:30:05,421 --> 01:30:07,423
Just don't get it done.

1195
01:30:07,423 --> 01:30:10,676
You're dealing with people,
You gotta be human.

1196
01:30:17,933 --> 01:30:21,052
Come on, Henry.
Let's get the hell out of this pop stand.

1197
01:30:21,053 --> 01:30:24,056
I wanna get to great falls
And spend my cut.

You try to
Remember it today.

Two-year-old steers
In the north pasture.

1201
01:31:05,347 --> 01:31:08,350
Cows, calves
And bred heifers in the south.

1202
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:10,352
Got it.

1203
01:31:15,357 --> 01:31:17,359
And I'll make
The lunch while you practice walking...

1204
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:20,362
That coin
Between your fingers.

1205
01:31:20,362 --> 01:31:23,365
You can wash
The dishes while I practice card tricks.
