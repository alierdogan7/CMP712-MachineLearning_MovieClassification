QUITE BEAUTIFUL SHERIFF.

00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:32,000
I'M SORRY, MAMA.

13
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,501

15
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,634
IT'S MR. SMITH, OKAY?

( Billy Ray )
NETTIE.

20
00:03:56,367 --> 00:04:02,434
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. TULEEN.

21
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:11,968
NETTIE, YOU NEED
TO BE CAREFUL.

22
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,834
I'LL GET 'EM.

23
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:19,968
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
CARE OF THESE BOOKS.

24
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,968
DO YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT ME, BILLY RAY?

25
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,701
OF COURSE I DO.

26
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,934
I USUALLY WONDER IF

27
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,868
YOU'RE DOING YOUR
HOMEWORK RIGHT.

28
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:34,534
NO, I MEAN

29
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:38,400
DO YOU EVER THINK
OF ME AS A WOMAN?

30
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:41,968
SOMEDAY, YOU'RE GONNA BE
A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

31
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:44,634
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU DON'T?

32
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,767
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

33
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:49,734
WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE GIRL,
ALL YOU WANT IS TO BE A WOMAN.

34
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,601
WHEN YOU'RE A WOMAN,
YOU REALIZE

35
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,767
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
TO BE A LITTLE GIRL.

36
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,100
IT'S DIFFERENT
FOR A MAN.

37
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,467
WHEN HE'S A BOY

38
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:59,167
HE NEEDS TO BEHAVE
AND MIND HIS FOLKS.

39
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:01,667
BUT WHEN
HE'S A MAN

40
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,400
HE HAS TO STAND TALL,
SPEAK THE TRUTH

41
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:06,300
MAKE AN HONEST
DAY'S LIVING

42
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,334
AND BE ABLE TO LOOK
ANY OTHER MAN

43
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,767
STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
WITHOUT FLINCHING.

44
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,934
( Charlie )
GOOD MORNIN', BILLY RAY.

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,367
GOOD MORNING, CHARLIE.

46
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:19,200
BEAUTIFUL MORNIN'
FOR PROCREATION.

47
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:25,334

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,234
BILLY RAY!

49
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:42,234
SEVEN MINUS
THREE EQUALS...

50
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,234
THINK ABOUT THIS
FOR A MINUTE, LON.

51
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,734
LET'S SAY YOU HAD
SEVEN CHICKENS

52
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:50,734
AND YOUR NEIGHBOR
CAME OVER

53
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:53,534
AND TOOK AWAY
THREE OF THEM.

54
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:58,701
HOW MANY WOULD
YOU HAVE LEFT?

55
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:01,701
WELL, I'D HAVE
SEVEN 'CAUSE

56
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:03,167
MY DADDY'D
SHOOT HIM

57
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:04,701

OF THE HENHOUSE.

( laughter )

59
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,267
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH
ARITHMETIC FOR TODAY.

60
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:18,033

SIT DOWN?

00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,868
U.S. GOVERNMENT
AND THE FEDERALES

178
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:01,467
BEEN SEARCHIN'
FOR HIM FOR YEARS.

179
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:05,000
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHIN'
ABOUT THIS " <i>EL DIABLO</i> ."

180
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:07,400
THEY DID FIND HIM ONCE.

181
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:09,067
CAUGHT HIM
DOWN IN AMOS,

182
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:11,234
THAT LITTLE BORDER TOWN
NORTH OF LAREDO.

183
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,100
CAUGHT HIM,
TRIED HIM

184
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:15,601
AND HANGED HIM,
ALL IN THE SAME NIGHT.

185
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,734
BUT HE WOULDN'T DIE.

186
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:20,200
HE JUST HANGED THERE
BY HIS NECK, SPITTIN'

187
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:23,534
AT THE CROWD LIKE
THEY DISGUSTED HIM.

188
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:24,868
CUSSED 'EM OUT SO BAD,

189
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:26,868
THE WOMENFOLK
HAD TO GO HOME.

190
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:29,501
I WAS THERE WHEN
THEY CUT HIM DOWN.

191
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:33,100
I THANK THE LORD
I LEFT WHEN I DID.

192
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,834
IT WAS THREE DAYS LATER,

193
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,400
SO THE STORY GOES

194
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:39,934
EL DIABLO RETURNED
TO AMOS WITH HIS MEN

195
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,434
AND CUT OUT THE
HEART OF EVERY MAN,

196
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:45,200
WOMAN AND CHILD
IN THE WHOLE TOWN

197
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:48,601
AND JUST LEFT THEM THERE
TO BLEACH IN THE SUN.

198
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,701
( woman crying )

199
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,634
SOON, THEY STARTED TO ROT

200
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:56,400
AND THEN THE
BUZZARDS COME

201
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:58,167
AND STARTED PECKIN'
AT THEIR EYES.

202
00:15:58,234 --> 00:16:00,000
SPIVEY, THAT'S
ENOUGH OF THAT.

203
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:02,667
DEVIL DON'T
NEVER DIE!

204
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:04,133
NO, SIR.

205
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,033
SO NO ONE'S
GONNA DO ANYTHING

206
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,000
ABOUT GETTING
MY NETTIE BACK.

207
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,200
PROBABLY CUT OUT
HER HEART AND EATEN IT.

208
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:11,534
OH, MY GOD.

209
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:13,701
I DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN'
ABOUT EATING THEIR HEARTS

210
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,234
HE JUST CUT
'EM OUT AND LEFT.

211
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,300
SPIVEY!

212
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:20,267
I'M SORRY, DEPUTY.

213
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:23,767
OR ARE YOU THE
SHERIFF NOW?

214
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:26,601
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE,
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY

215
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,834
TO GO AFTER EL DIABLO.

216
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:30,000
( crowd murmurring )

217
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,300
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO ABOUT IT, SHERIFF?

218
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,567
AT LAST REPORT,
THE DOC SAYS

219
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:36,234
THE SHERIFF'S FEELIN'
MUCH BETTER.

220
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,601
( chicken clucking )

221
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,267
AND I SUPPOSE
HE'S BEEN WORKIN'

222
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,100
ON HIS SIGN
LANGUAGE, TOO?

223
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,400
( crowd laughing )

224
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,567
SPIVEY'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE THE NEW SHERIFF.

225
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:46,000
WE PAY YOUR WAGE.

226
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:48,300
( man )
YEAH. RIGHT.

227
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:54,434
I INTEND TO BRING
NETTIE BACK.

228
00:16:56,901 --> 00:17:00,000
I SAID, I INTEND TO
BRING BACK NETTIE.

229
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:06,000
YOU AND WHO ELSE,
SCHOOLTEACHER?

230
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:11,634
ME AND KID DURANGO,
THAT'S WHO.

231
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:13,601
I MEAN,
KID DURANGO AND I.

232
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:17,467
CHARLIE, YOU
GOT COMPETITION.

233
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:20,534
( man )
CAN'T EVEN SHOOT A GUN.

234
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:23,534
( Billy Ray )
I INTEND TO LEARN
TO SHOOT A GUN.

235
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:26,200
EL DIABLO'S GONNA DROP
A LOAD OF MANURE IN

236
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:32,367
HIS PANTS WHEN HE SEES
YOU COMIN' AT HIM.

237
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:56,267
( gunshots )

238
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,701
( Spivey )
I DO KNOW ONE MAN

239
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:02,868
MY SECOND COUSIN
MAGGIE SUE'S BROTHER-IN-LAW

240
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:05,167
J.D. SHOANS.

241
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,601
( gunshot )

242
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:09,467
HE'S SOME KIND
OF LAWMAN NOW,

243
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:11,167
TEXAS RANGER.

244
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:12,400
( gunshot )

245
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:17,133
HE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE
RODE WITH KID DURANGO.

246
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,968
( gunshot )

247
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,434
TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

248
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:23,534
WE NEVER HAD ALL THAT
MUCH TO DO WITH HIM.

249
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:25,534
( gunshot )

250
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:26,834
SORT OF THE DISGRACE

251
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:30,934
OF THE FAMILY,
YOU KNOW?

252
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,834
( gunshot )

253
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:35,100
HE SHOT AND KILLED
MY COUSIN DEKE

254
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:38,868
ABOUT EIGHT YEARS
AGO UP IN SONOMA.

255
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,634
HE ALSO SHOT
AND KILLED

256
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:44,534
MY DADDY'S
BROTHER EDWARD.

257
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:45,434
( gunshot )

258
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:46,567
WHERE'S HE NOW?

259
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:50,133
THE LAST TIME I HEARD,
HE WAS UP IN MILLENNIUM.

260
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,667
SOME KIND OF MARSHAL
OR RANGER UP THERE.

261
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,267
HELL, AIN'T BUT A
TURD'S DIFFERENCE

262
00:18:57,334 --> 00:19:00,767
BETWEEN J.D. AND
THE SCUM HE HAULS IN.

263
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,434
BUT IF ANYBODY
COULD HELP YOU

264
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:08,200
FIND KID DURANGO,
IT'D BE HIM.

265
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:14,367
YOU NEED BIGGER BOTTLES.

266
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:16,868
YOU BE DARN CAREFUL
WHO YOU SHOW THAT TO.

267
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:23,033
YES, SIR.

268
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:29,434
SHERIFF EDWARDS
WROTE YOU THIS NOTE.

269
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:34,067
"DON'T GO."

270
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:37,334
THANK HIM FOR
THE ADVICE.

271
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,133
YOU'RE A DARN
FOOL, BILLY RAY.

272
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,767
YES, SIR,
I KNOW.

273
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:45,467
COME ON, ROJO.

274
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:53,300
ONLY GOD CAN KILL
THE DEVIL, BILLY RAY.

275
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:59,434
FORWARD.

276
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:38,501
( gunshot )

277
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:44,634
( man )
BILLY RAY DONE SHOT HIS HORSE!

278
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:50,100
( Billy Ray)
 <i>MY JOURNEY DID</i>
 <i>NOT BEGIN ON A GOOD NOTE.</i>

279
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:52,534
 <i>I WAS NONETHELESS</i>
 <i>DETERMINED TO PRESS ON.</i>

280
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:55,000
 <i>AFTER ARRANGING</i>
 <i>FOR TRANSPORT,</i>

281
00:21:55,067 --> 00:22:01,167
 <i>I ARRIVED IN MILLENNIUM</i>
 <i>THREE DAYS LATER.</i>

282
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:19,133
EXCUSE ME.

283
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,267
CAN YOU TELL ME

284
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:23,667
WHERE I CAN FIND
A MR. J.D. SHOANS?

285
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:26,434
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH HIM, SONNY?

286
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:28,367
I JUST HAVE A VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION

287
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,934
I'D LIKE TO ASK HIM.

288
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,834
YOU SHOULD'VE
ASKED HIM YESTERDAY.

289
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:37,734
( Conductor )
ALL ABOARD!

290
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:39,133

WE ARE NOW COMMITTING

291
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,601

MR. SHOANS

293
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,534
TO HIS LIFE IN
THE HEREAFTER.

294
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:47,601
LET'S TAKE A MOMENT
TO ACKNOWLEDGE

295
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,567
HIS CONTRIBUTIONS
TO OUR COMMUNITY.

296
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:53,033
DURING HIS SHORT-LIVED
TERM AS SHERIFF,

297
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,567
HE SERVED THE PUBLIC TO
THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY.

298
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:59,501
HE SHOT EIGHT MEN
AND THREE WOMEN

299
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:03,267
MOST OF WHOM ENGAGED IN
BREAKING THE LAW.

300
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:06,868
I'M SURE THE OTHERS
WERE HONEST MISTAKES.

301
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:08,934
( Billy Ray )
WHAT HAPPENED?

302
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,467

YOU GOT BUSINESS
WITH J.D.?

307
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:26,367
YEAH.

308
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:29,234
I'M THE SHERIFF NOW.

309
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
MAYBE I CAN BE OF
SOME ASSISTANCE.

310
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:37,434
( gunshot )

311
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,434

THROW THE DIRT ON HIM

312
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:45,868
AND LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

313
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:47,868
ARE YOU RELATED TO HIM?

314
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:54,000
NO, SIR.

315
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:05,968
( woman chattering )

316
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:12,133
I WANNA THANK YOU
FOR DISTRACTIN' THEM FOLK.

317
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:34,334
WHAT YOU LOOKIN' AT?

318
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,534
YOU JUST SHOT
HIM IN THE BACK.

319
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:39,033
HIS BACK WAS TO ME.

320
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,801
COME ON, BOY, HELP
ME OUTTA THIS HOLE.

321
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:47,200
COME ON,

322
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:50,434
BESIDES, HE SHOT

323
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:52,267
JUST SEEMED RIGHT.

324
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:53,501

00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:54,501
YEAH.

326
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,601
SAID HE WANTED TO
BE SHERIFF REAL BAD.

327
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,133
NOW HE'S SHERIFF

328
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,267

329
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:15,200
REO HERE DON'T LIKE
GUNFIRE. HURTS HIS EARS.

330
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:16,734
MAYBE YOU CAN

00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:19,667
I CAN FIND A MAN
NAMED KID DURANGO?

332
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:21,434
WHAT DO YOU
WANT HIM FOR?

333
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:24,033
THEY SAY HE'S THE
FASTEST GUN IN THE WEST.

334
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,934

00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:47,367
BUT, I CHEAT

341
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:50,434
FAST DON'T MEAN A
WHOLE LOT THESE DAYS.

342
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:52,534
US PROFESSIONAL
FOLKS ARE TIRED

343

00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:31,801
I COULD STAY HERE

365
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:07,868
I'M SORRY, REO.

366
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:10,300
IF YOU'D BE SO KIND

00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,634
AS TO LEAVE THAT
SADDLE WHERE IT IS,

368
00:27:12,701 --> 00:27:14,000
WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY.

TRICKS OF THE TRADE.

494

THEY AIN'T

511
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:23,701
IT'S THE BRIGHTEST
STAR IN PEGASUS

512
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:28,033

524
00:42:01,634 --> 00:42:03,634
DROP YOUR EYES
FROM THAT TARGET,

525
00:42:03,701 --> 00:42:09,033

531
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:17,200

YOU BETTER START
PRAYIN' THAT WASN'T REO.

532
00:43:41,534 --> 00:43:47,601

533
00:43:54,033 --> 00:44:00,100
BEBE?

534
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:14,801

535
00:44:14,868 --> 00:44:17,634
HE MISSED?

536
00:44:17,701 --> 00:44:24,734
I GUESS THE BALANCE
AIN'T QUITE RIGHT.

537
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:27,000
WHERE THE HELL
DID YOU GET THAT?

538
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:29,434
RIGHT OFF THE SON
OF A BITCH'S BOOT.

539
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,100
YOU GOT IT.

540
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:33,300
THIS BOY
HERE GOT IT.

541
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:36,200
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
THEY STOLE HIS GIRL.

542
00:44:36,267 --> 00:44:38,267
ACTUALLY, SHE WAS
ONE OF MY STUDENTS.

543
00:44:38,334 --> 00:44:41,200
PRETTIEST ONE IN
THE  CLASS, I'LL BET.

544
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:42,501
I MAKE IT A POLICY

545
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:46,434
NOT TO GET INVOLVED
WITH MY STUDENTS.

546
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:47,968
( laughter )

547
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:51,434

549
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:57,234
OL' EL DIABLO DOES
FAVOR HIS SPURS.

550
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,267
GETTING IN'S
THE EASY PART.

551
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:01,801
IF YOU DON'T TAKE THE
WHOLE DAMN THING

552
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:03,534
IN WITH YOU

553
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:10,801
YOU JUST MIGHT GET BACK
OUT AGAIN IN ONE PIECE.

554
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:13,934
WHAT THE HELL YOU

IF YOU DO NOT TAKE
THE LORD SERIOUSLY

NOT ONLY WILL THE SOULS
OF THESE POOR UNFORTUNATES

600

BE EXILED FOR
ETERNITY IN HELL

00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,501
I ROB AN INDIAN,
SAME AS ANYBODY.

704
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,200
YEAH, DID YOU SLEEP
WITH HIS WIFE, TOO?

705
00:53:18,267 --> 00:53:21,501
WHAT WAS IT LIKE SLEEPIN'
WITH AN INDIAN WOMAN?

706
00:53:21,567 --> 00:53:27,634
( Napier )
BETTER THAN A NIGGER.

707
00:53:41,467 --> 00:53:45,300
( Thomas )
THANK YOU, BOY.

708
00:53:45,367 --> 00:53:49,701
NOW, GENERALLY, I LET
A MAN OFF FIRST TIME

709
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:51,601
HE SAY THAT
TO ME.

710
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:55,267
THAT IS, IF HE
SAYS HE'S SORRY.

711
00:53:55,334 --> 00:53:59,000
HOW ABOUT YOU,
MR. NAPIER?

712
00:53:59,067 --> 00:54:01,033
ARE YOU SORRY?

713
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:06,267
I DON'T HEAR YOU,
MR. NAPIER.

714
00:54:06,334 --> 00:54:08,167

( chanting )

718
00:55:18,601 --> 00:55:20,767
SOMEONE OUGHT TO
TRY TO TALK TO HIM.

719

GO ON, BOB,

NO STORIES ABOUT
NO NEGRO COWBOYS.

RAPING AND PILLAGING.

BOTH OF THEM.

01:09:27,267 --> 01:09:29,300
( speaking Spanish )

874
01:09:29,367 --> 01:09:32,567
NEVER TRUST A MAN WHO
TALKS TO HIS SNAKE.

875
01:09:32,634 --> 01:09:37,033
IT'S TRUMAN.

876
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:43,267
MORNING.

877
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:45,434
( Thomas )
WHAT THE HELL YOU
DOIN', FEATHERS?

878
01:09:45,501 --> 01:09:47,400
WELL,

879
01:09:47,467 --> 01:09:49,501
I'VE DECIDED TO JOIN
YOUR EXPEDITION.

880
01:09:49,567 --> 01:09:52,000
NOT WITH ME,
YOU AIN'T.

881
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:54,033
YOU WON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ME.

882
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,467
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

883
01:09:55,534 --> 01:09:57,801
I'M WORRIED ABOUT US,
WITH YOU OUT THERE.

884
01:09:57,868 --> 01:09:59,701
OH, THOMAS, PLEASE.

885
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:01,100
I'M SURE I CAN PERFORM

886
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:03,667
SOME VERY USEFUL
FUNCTIONS ON THE TRAIL.

887
01:10:03,734 --> 01:10:06,567
AND BESIDES, I'M
AN EXCELLENT COOK.

888
01:10:06,634 --> 01:10:09,334
CAN YOU MAKE COFFEE?

889
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,801
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

890
01:10:10,868 --> 01:10:13,067
I BROUGHT SOME FRESH
COLUMBIAN BEANS.

891
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:17,434
AND, BY THE WAY, I MAKE
A WONDERFUL OMELET.

892
01:10:17,501 --> 01:10:19,234
( Dancing Bear )
WHAT IS "OMELET?"

893
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:23,934
AN OMELET IS DICED HAM,
CHEESE, PEPPERS

894
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,601
FOLDED INTO THREE
EGGS, COOKED

895
01:10:25,667 --> 01:10:28,501
IN AN IRON SKILLET,
SLIGHTLY WARMED.

896
01:10:28,567 --> 01:10:31,834
MUSHROOMS, SNAKE MEAT,
SQUASH? GOOD?

897
01:10:31,901 --> 01:10:34,767
GOOD? I WOULDN'T
RECOMMEND THE SQUASH BUT

898
01:10:34,834 --> 01:10:36,400
IT'S ENTIRELY
UP TO YOU.

899
01:10:36,467 --> 01:10:39,734
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE,
LET'S MOVE OUT!

900
01:10:39,801 --> 01:10:46,234
COME ON.

901
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,367
FORWARD!

902
01:10:48,434 --> 01:10:50,501
( Billy Ray )
 <i>THOUGH STILL PUZZLED</i>
 <i>BY THE REVELATION</i>

903
01:10:50,567 --> 01:10:52,634
 <i>THAT TRUMAN WAS</i>
 <i>KID DURANGO</i>

904
01:10:52,701 --> 01:10:54,100
 <i>OR NOT KID DURANGO,</i>

905
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,033
 <i>I WAS EXCITED THAT</i>
 <i>HE HAD JOINED US.</i>

906
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,701
 <i>IT AFFORDED ME</i>
 <i>THE OPPORTUNITY</i>

907
01:10:57,767 --> 01:10:59,567
 <i>TO CLEAR UP MY CONFUSION</i>

908
01:10:59,634 --> 01:11:02,000
 <i>AND I LOOKED FORWARD</i>
 <i>TO ONE OF HIS OMELETS</i> .

909
01:11:02,067 --> 01:11:04,400
NOW, I STILL
DON'T UNDERSTAND

910
01:11:04,467 --> 01:11:07,033
WHY YOU'RE COMIN'
ALONG WITH US.

911
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,167
ACTUALLY, IT'S YOUR
EXAMPLE, BILLY RAY.

912
01:11:10,234 --> 01:11:11,434
I'VE ALWAYS WRITTEN

913
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:13,033
ABOUT OTHER
PEOPLE'S EXPLOITS.

914
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:15,501
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT
BEFORE I PASS ON

915
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:19,801
I COULD INCLUDE A FEW
ADVENTURES OF MY VERY OWN.

916
01:11:19,868 --> 01:11:21,868
THAT WAS A WONDERFUL
MOMENT YESTERDAY

917
01:11:21,934 --> 01:11:24,634
IN THE STREETS WITH
YOU AND PESTOSO.

918
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:28,100
IT WAS THRILLING,
VIRTUALLY WRITES ITSELF.

919
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:31,100
YOU'RE GONNA PUT ME
IN ONE OF YOUR BOOKS?

920
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:35,300
OF COURSE. EVERY
STORY NEEDS ITS HERO.

921
01:11:35,367 --> 01:11:38,300
( Thomas )
HEY, BOY, LEMME
SEE THAT SPUR.

922
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:44,434
YES, SIR.

923
01:11:48,367 --> 01:11:50,434
YOU HOLD ONTO
THAT HALF, BOY.

924
01:11:50,501 --> 01:11:52,667
THAT'S YOUR
CALLING CARD.

925
01:11:52,734 --> 01:11:54,167
GO AHEAD ON.

926
01:11:54,234 --> 01:11:57,467
BE RIGHT BEHIND
YOU. GO ON.

927
01:11:57,534 --> 01:11:59,200
GOOD LUCK,
BILLY RAY.

928
01:11:59,267 --> 01:12:05,367
THANK YOU.
GOODBYE.

929
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,501
EXCUSE ME, COULD
YOU TELL ME PRECISELY

930
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:27,267
WHY THEY CALL THIS
THE TREE OF DEATH?

931
01:12:27,334 --> 01:12:30,167
( Billy Ray )
EXCUSE ME.

932
01:12:30,234 --> 01:12:32,000
( Billy Ray )
 <i>I MET CHAK MOL AS ARRANGED</i>

933
01:12:32,067 --> 01:12:36,033
 <i>AND I FOLLOWED HIM</i>
 <i>DEEPER INTO MEXICO.</i>

934
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,133
 <i>MY NERVES, NORMALLY QUITE</i>
 <i>STEADY, WERE ACTING UP</i>

935
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:43,968
 <i>AS I SENSED US GETTING</i>
 <i>CLOSER AND CLOSER TO EL DIABLO</i> .

936
01:12:44,033 --> 01:12:46,200
 <i>SURELY, THE TENSION</i>
 <i>WOULD'VE BEEN EASED</i>

937
01:12:46,267 --> 01:12:49,634
 <i>IF CHAK MOL HAD BEEN A</i>
 <i>BETTER CONVERSATIONALIST.</i>

938
01:12:49,701 --> 01:12:55,767
 <i>PERHAPS HE WAS SHY.</i>

939
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:21,300
THANK YOU.

940
01:13:21,367 --> 01:13:27,434
SORRY.

941
01:13:35,467 --> 01:13:39,400
THEY'RE TOO SPLIT UP FOR
US TO GET ALL AT ONCE.

942
01:13:39,467 --> 01:13:40,868
I THINK THERE
MIGHT JUST BE

943
01:13:40,934 --> 01:13:47,033
A SOLUTION TO THIS
PROBLEM FORTHCOMING.

944
01:13:55,767 --> 01:14:02,000
( speaking Spanish )

945
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:07,634
( gunshots )

946
01:14:07,701 --> 01:14:13,767
( speaking Spanish )

947
01:15:02,334 --> 01:15:04,767
WE SPLIT UP HERE.

948
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:08,767
THAT LEFT TUNNEL WILL LET YOU
OUT ABOVE THE VILLAGE.

949
01:15:08,834 --> 01:15:13,067
WAIT FOR MY SIGNAL.
GOOD ENOUGH?

950
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:15,200
I THINK A LITTLE
PRAYER IS IN ORDER

951
01:15:15,267 --> 01:15:17,334
BEFORE WE EMBARK ON
THIS PERILOUS ORDEAL.

952
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,501
IF YOU WILL ALL JOIN ME IN
RECITING THE LORD'S PRAYER.

953
01:15:20,567 --> 01:15:22,067
"OUR FATHER--

954
01:15:22,133 --> 01:15:24,267
"OUR FATHER,

"THY KINGDOM COME.

01:15:31,467 --> 01:15:35,434
THIS IS SORRY WORK
PARTY, BROWN MAN.

958
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:39,701
I DID THE BEST I
COULD, RED MAN.

959
01:15:39,767 --> 01:15:45,033
I'M HERE TO FREE MY PEOPLE.
DON'T YOU GET IN MY WAY.

960
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:51,167
WOULDN'T THINK OF IT.

961
01:15:56,701 --> 01:15:58,901
THOMAS?

962
01:15:58,968 --> 01:16:01,167
I'D LIKE TO HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU.

963
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:03,067
IF IT'S SHORT.

964
01:16:03,133 --> 01:16:06,267
I FIND YOUR BEHAVIOR IN THIS
ENDEAVOR QUESTIONABLE.

965
01:16:06,334 --> 01:16:09,100
IT'S PERFECTLY OBVIOUS TO
ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

966
01:16:09,167 --> 01:16:12,267
YOU'RE USING THIS
BOY AS A DIVERSION

967
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:15,567
SO THAT YOU CAN STEAL AS
MUCH GOLD AS YOU CAN CARRY.

968
01:16:15,634 --> 01:16:19,868
ONLY DANCING BEAR IS MOTIVATED
BY HONORABLE INTENTIONS.

969
01:16:19,934 --> 01:16:21,400
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

970
01:16:21,467 --> 01:16:24,834
YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH
OF MERCENARIES.

971
01:16:24,901 --> 01:16:26,601
YOU FINISHED?

972
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:28,501
YES.

973
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:32,300
I HAD TO GET IT
OFF MY CHEST.

974
01:16:32,367 --> 01:16:40,167
HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER.
COME ON, REO.

975
01:16:40,234 --> 01:16:45,868

EL DIABLO WON'T TOUCH
THE KID WITHOUT HIS SPUR.

 <i>WHEN I ARRIVED AT EL</i>
 <i>DIABLO'S COMPOUND,</i>

977
01:16:48,033 --> 01:16:50,501
 <i>HE WAS NOT IN THE VICINITY</i> .

978
01:16:50,567 --> 01:16:53,434
 <i>I DECIDED TO WAIT AND</i>
 <i>NOT BE IMPATIENT.</i>

MR. DEVIL, IS IT?

985
01:17:40,467 --> 01:17:43,801
I UNDERSTAND,
MR. WILLIAM RAYMOND SMITH

986
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:47,901
YOU HAVE BROUGHT
SOMETHING FOR ME.

987
01:17:47,968 --> 01:17:51,667
YES, SIR.

988
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:54,167
THIS IS MY SPUR,
I BELIEVE?

989
01:17:54,234 --> 01:17:58,000
THAT IS CORRECT.

990
01:17:58,067 --> 01:18:00,501
THERE IS
SOMETHING MISSING.

991
01:18:00,567 --> 01:18:05,200
THAT IS ALSO CORRECT.

992
01:18:05,267 --> 01:18:08,200
WHERE IS THE
MISSING PIECE?

993
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:14,801
THAT'S FOR ME TO KNOW
AND YOU TO FIND OUT.

994
01:18:14,868 --> 01:18:16,567

IS, FOR THE GIRL.

WHAT GIRL IS THAT?

997
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:27,033
MISS NETTIE TULEEN.

998
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,634
YOU KIDNAPPED
HER IN FRONT

999
01:18:28,701 --> 01:18:32,934
OF MY SCHOOL ABOUT
FIVE WEEKS AGO?

1000
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:39,167
SO MANY TOWNS,
SO MANY GIRLS.

1001
01:18:39,234 --> 01:18:41,834
SHE'S ABOUT 5-FOOT-4

1002
01:18:41,901 --> 01:18:45,501
BLONDE HAIR,
BLUE EYES

1003
01:18:45,567 --> 01:18:47,434
QUITE ATTRACTIVE

1004
01:18:47,501 --> 01:18:54,667
AND A VERY
GOOD STUDENT.

1005
01:18:54,734 --> 01:18:57,033
DOES SHE
LOOK LIKE

1006
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:00,767

1007
01:19:00,834 --> 01:19:06,901
YES, SHE DOES.

1008

I DON'T RECALL
THAT OUTFIT.

1009
01:19:11,634 --> 01:19:19,267
YES, SHE IS
QUITE ATTRACTIVE.

( Billy Ray )
 <i>I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES.</i>

1011
01:19:21,501 --> 01:19:23,234
 <i>THIS WAS NOT</i>
 <i>THE SAME NETTIE</i>

 <i>FIVE WEEKS AGO.</i>

1016
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,434
I LIKE MY SPURS
VERY MUCH, MR. SMITH.

1017

THEY BELONGED
TO MY FATHER

1018

AND HIS FATHER'S
FATHER'S FATHER.

1019
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,734
I'D LIKE TO HAVE BACK
THE PIECE YOU'VE STOLEN.

1020
01:19:56,801 --> 01:19:58,767
TECHNICALLY,
IT WASN'T STOLEN.

1021
01:19:58,834 --> 01:20:01,434
BUT, YOU SEE, ROSITA--

1022
01:20:01,501 --> 01:20:02,667
ROSITA?

( El Diablo )
MY ROSITA

1024
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:11,400
MEANS MORE TO ME
THAN A FAMILY BAUBLE.

( Thomas )
THERE'S THE BOY.

1026
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:49,467
THEY'RE ALL OVER
THE PLACE.

1027
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:59,868
SEEMS YOUR PLAN
HAS TAKEN

1028
01:20:59,934 --> 01:21:06,000
AN UNEXPECTED TURN
FOR THE WORSE, THOMAS.

THREE TIMES FAST.

SPOILED BY SPARE SPURS.
SPOILED BY SPARE SPURS.

SPOILED BY SPARE...

1034
01:21:24,868 --> 01:21:26,467
SHUT UP!

1035
01:21:26,534 --> 01:21:30,834
SORRY, JUST STARTING TO GET
WORRIED ABOUT THE BOY.

1036
01:21:30,901 --> 01:21:33,133
DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL HURT HIM?

1037
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:38,901
I'M GONNA HURT YOU IF
YOU DON'T SHUT UP!

1040
01:21:43,934 --> 01:21:46,167
YOU CAN RIDE IN FRONT
ON THE WAY HOME.

1041
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:48,801
NO, NOT THE WAY HOME!

01:21:54,868 --> 01:22:00,934
QUIET!

1046
01:22:07,501 --> 01:22:13,567
HELLO, GENTLEMEN.

1049
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:33,868
NICE PANTS.

1050
01:22:33,934 --> 01:22:35,868
THESE ARE
NOT MY PEOPLE.

1051
01:22:35,934 --> 01:22:37,968
DAMN IT! I KNEW WE
SHOULD'VE TAKEN

1052
01:22:38,033 --> 01:22:40,334
A RIGHT AT
THAT LAST FORK.

1053
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,100
THROW DOWN
YOUR WEAPONS.

1054
01:22:42,167 --> 01:22:44,434

WE GOT NO QUARREL

1055
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,767

COLLINS CATERING.
HOW DO YOU DO?

1057
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:51,334
I WOULD TO INTRODUCE
MY ASSISTANTS.

1058
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,100

1059
01:22:53,167 --> 01:22:59,234
BEBE. WE HAVE FINE WINES,
DELICACIES, SILKEN ROBES...

1060
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:08,934
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

1061
01:23:09,033 --> 01:23:13,968
IS NOTHING.

1062
01:23:14,033 --> 01:23:16,033
YOU CAN HAVE
ANYTHING YOU WANT

1063
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,501
IN THE WAGON,
BUT DON'T TOUCH

1064
01:23:18,567 --> 01:23:23,167
THE BAG, OKAY?

1065
01:23:23,234 --> 01:23:28,767
I WILL DECIDE
WHAT I WANT.

1066
01:23:28,834 --> 01:23:32,200
AMIGO, I WOULD
RATHER DIE

1067
01:23:32,267 --> 01:23:39,968

( gunshots )

1074
01:25:06,767 --> 01:25:10,567
WHEN MY FAMILY CAME
TO THIS COUNTRY

1075
01:25:10,634 --> 01:25:13,501
THEY ENCOUNTERED
INCREDIBLE INTELLIGENCE

1076
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:16,133
AND INCREDIBLE SAVAGERY.

1077
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,434
( gunshot )

1078
01:25:18,501 --> 01:25:20,934
THE MAYANS BUILT THE
PYRAMIDS, CHARTED

1079
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,801
THE HEAVENS AND
GAVE US OUR CALENDAR.

1080
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:25,734
BUT THE AZTECS

1081
01:25:25,801 --> 01:25:30,634
BROUGHT THE ART OF HUMAN
SACRIFICE TO A NEW HEIGHT.

1082
01:25:30,701 --> 01:25:36,767
( gunshots )

1083
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,501
JESUS!

1084
01:26:08,567 --> 01:26:14,634
COME ON!

1085
01:26:24,133 --> 01:26:30,234
WHAT THE HELL?

1086
01:26:32,267 --> 01:26:38,334
YEEHAAA!

1087
01:26:42,467 --> 01:26:48,534
THAT'S ME COMIN',

( gunshots and screaming )

1090
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:32,701
WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT
THAN WRITIN' ABOUT IT?

1091
01:28:35,634 --> 01:28:41,701
HE TOOK NETTIE.
WE HAVE TO CATCH HIM.

1092
01:29:09,067 --> 01:29:15,133
GOOD OL' BEBE.

1093
01:29:18,434 --> 01:29:19,801
SO THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE HERE?

1094
01:29:19,868 --> 01:29:21,300
FOR THE GOLD?

1095
01:29:21,367 --> 01:29:25,467
THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO
YOU THAN SAVING THE GIRL?

1096
01:29:25,534 --> 01:29:31,601
THE GIRL AIN'T
MY PROBLEM.

1097

1105
01:31:04,734 --> 01:31:07,734
I WANT THE GIRL.

AM I TO BE FRIGHTENED

1114
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:53,100

HAVE TO DO THIS.

1115
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:55,734
YES, I DO.

BUT YOU ARE THE GUEST,

1118
01:32:02,234 --> 01:32:08,334
I WILL WAIT FOR YOU TO

( gunshot )

1120
01:32:40,901 --> 01:32:45,534
TRUMAN, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

1121
01:32:45,601 --> 01:32:48,067
YES, I DID.

1122
01:32:48,133 --> 01:32:54,701
( Truman )
I DID.

1123
01:32:54,767 --> 01:32:56,701
IT HURTS.

1124
01:32:56,767 --> 01:33:03,334
I'M SORRY.

1125
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:06,667
I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT THE PAIN.

1126
01:33:06,734 --> 01:33:13,300
I ASSUMED IT WOULD
BE OVER QUICKLY.

1127
01:33:13,367 --> 01:33:18,067
PERHAPS I SHOULD'VE
LOOKED AT HIS HANDS

1128
01:33:18,133 --> 01:33:24,200
NOT HIS EYES.

1129
01:33:24,267 --> 01:33:30,667
YOU'RE RUINING A
PERFECTLY GOOD SCARF.

1130
01:33:30,734 --> 01:33:36,801
I'M SORRY.

1131
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:43,267
I WANT YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME.

1132
01:33:43,334 --> 01:33:48,367
ANYTHING,
I'LL DO ANYTHING.

1133
01:33:48,434 --> 01:33:51,934
KILL HIM.

1134
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,200
KILL EL DIABLO.

1135
01:33:55,267 --> 01:34:01,334
( Truman )
COMPLETE THE STORY, BILLY RAY.

1136
01:34:06,901 --> 01:34:10,901
TRUMAN, YOU'RE
NOT GONNA DIE.

1137
01:34:10,968 --> 01:34:14,767
I KNOW.

1138
01:34:14,834 --> 01:34:20,934
I'VE NEVER
FELT SO ALIVE.

1139
01:34:31,133 --> 01:34:34,701
IN WHOSE ARMS ARE YOU
GOING TO DIE, LITTLE BOY?

1140
01:34:34,767 --> 01:34:36,801
HE DIDN'T EVEN
GO FOR HIS GUN.

1141
01:34:36,868 --> 01:34:39,100
I WAS GETTING BORED.

1142
01:34:39,167 --> 01:34:42,367
I'M A BUSY MAN.

1143
01:34:42,434 --> 01:34:45,000
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE
ME TO SHOOT YOU?

1144
01:34:45,067 --> 01:34:48,100
I WILL GIVE YOU THE CHOICE.

1145
01:34:48,167 --> 01:34:49,300
WHERE?

1146
01:34:49,367 --> 01:34:55,467
( speaking Spanish )

1147
01:35:05,801 --> 01:35:08,267
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
THE STOMACH.

1148
01:35:08,334 --> 01:35:11,467
IT IS VERY PAINFUL AND
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO DIE.

1149
01:35:11,534 --> 01:35:13,934
BUT MAKE A DECISION
QUICKLY, PLEASE.

1150
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,400

I'M AN IMPATIENT MAN.

1151

HOW ABOUT YOU
JUST WING ME

1152
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:25,501

RIGHT ABOUT HERE.

1153

FINALLY, SOMEONE WHO IS
WORTHY OF THE CHALLENGE.

1158
01:36:39,067 --> 01:36:41,968
CUT THE BULLSHIT,
EL DIABLO.

1159
01:36:42,033 --> 01:36:48,100

DAMN, BOY! YOU SHOT
HIM IN THE BACK.

1167
01:39:18,968 --> 01:39:25,033
WELL, HIS BACK
WAS TO ME.

1168
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:38,534
I FORGOT.
