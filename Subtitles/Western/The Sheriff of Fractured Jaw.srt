00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,352
Ah! Come on, everybody,
drinks on the house for all of you.

489
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,630
[BAND PLAYS AS MEN CHEER]

490
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,395
l never seen Keeno look
so peaceable before.

491
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,791
How can you, sir, as mayor of this town,
permit such a thing to happen?

492
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,155
l told them to do
their gunning out in the open.

493
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,232
Shooting matches in a crowded saloon
like this can be dangerous.

494
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,231
Some innocent bystander
might get hurt.

495
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,312
-Well, haven't you got any laws?
-Sure, we got more laws. . .

496
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,552
. . .than you can shake a stick at.
Got nobody to enforce them.

497
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,429
l hate to think what them Box T boys
will do when they find about this killing.

498
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,716
Well, this is preposterous.
Good heavens. . .

499
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,230
-. . .haven't you got a constabulary?
-Con--? Con--?

500
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,709
A constabulary, a guardian
of the law, a bobby, a--

501
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,194
Oh, you mean a sheriff.

502
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,874
Whatever the man's called out here
who sees to the law.

503
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,469
We been trying to get us a sheriff
for a long time. . .

504
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,796
. . .but we can't get nobody
to take the job.

505
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,992
lf you could find us a sheriff
we'd be mighty grateful to you.

506
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,634
l've never heard anything like this
before in my life.

507
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,032
lt's the duty of every citizen
not to shirk his civic responsibility.

508
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,913
Yeah, that's right, it is.
Oh, would you--?

509
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,031
-Would you care for a drink?
-Delighted.

510
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,959
-Good health, sir.
-Same to you.

511
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,756
You know, this stuff isn't too bad
when it burns away the nerve ends.

512
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,956
-That's a good--
-What were we talking about?

513
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,271
-A sheriff. Yeah.
-lndeed. Now, it's vital.

514
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,517
lt's vital, sir.
Select your man, go up to him. . .

515
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,472
...look at him square in the eyes.

516
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,672
Speak to him with a firm tone
and don't take no for an answer.

517
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,838
Never fails, my dear sir, it never fails.

518
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,555
Would that be the way to talk
to a man like yourself, for instance?

519
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,239
Absolutely.

520
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,118
You mean,
just walk up to him and say:

521
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,273
''Lookie here, mister, this here town
needs a sheriff, and you're gonna be it. ''

522
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,799
Jolly good, jolly good.

523
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,310
Mister, you've talked yourself
into a job.

524
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:14,072
Welcome to Fractured Jaw,
Sheriff Tibbs.

525
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,951
''Sheriff Tibbs.

526
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,594
These is all
that was left of Sheriff Dalton. . .

527
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,189
. . .Sheriff Harper and Sheriff Baines.

528
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,675
lf any of them fit you, good luck.

529
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,075
Respectfully yours, Doc Masters.

530
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,478
P.S. Their duty done,
they rest in peace. ''

531
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,394
Him, sheriff?

532
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,757
Don't you get all hot and bothered
about this fellow being sheriff.

533
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,629
l tell you, he'll make a great sheriff.
He ain't nothing but a gunman, after all.

534
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,792
And he's quicker
than greased lightning on the draw.

535
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,394
Last night, l seen him
stand up at that there bar. . .

536
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,790
. . .and drink a lot of cowpokes
under the table. . .

537
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,951
. . .and walk out of here
as sober as a judge.

538
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,750
l tell you, l do like me a drinking sheriff
that can hold his liquor.

539
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,837
Oh, good morning,
good morning, sheriff.

540
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,991
-That's what l want to see you about.
-Yeah.

541
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,119
Everybody in town feels a heap sight
safer now that you're in charge of things.

542
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,477
-l am not the sheriff.
-Oh, sure. Sure you are.

543
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,195
Do you see that gun rack there? We
passed an ordinance last spring saying. . .

544
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,319
. . .that nobody could wear guns inside
Fractured Jaw, not even the mayor.

545
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,994
l don't know the laws
your council passed last spring.

546
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,878
All l know is that
this is ridiculous.

547
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,679
How can l be a sheriff?
l'm not a citizen of this town.

548
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,475
-l'm not even a citizen of this country.
-As mayor of Fractured Jaw. . .

549
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,950
. . .l hereby exercise my civil rights
and prerogatives. . .

550
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,630
. . .and l appoint you a citizen
of the United States of America. . .

551
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,310
. . .and l make you
sheriff of Fractured Jaw.

552
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,829
There, there you be.

553
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,315
Now, you can have
as many deputies as you like. . .

554
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,988
. . .providing you can find
any men to serve with you.

555
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,630
Listen, my dear mayor, quite apart
from all the idiocies of last night. . .

556
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,276
. . .this is absolutely absurd.
l'm here on business. Guns.

557
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,438
Oh, that's all right,
we don't care about that.

558
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,872
Everything will be perfectly legal
as long as you're a-wearing that badge.

559
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,355
-Cold feet, friend?
-No, quite warm, thank you.

560
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,199
Big talker,
but when it comes to backing it up. . . .

561
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,516
Really, this is just
a little misunderstanding.

562
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,079
ls it? l'll get the coffee.

563
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,316
Oh, thank you so much.
l could do with a cup.

564
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,114
My head doesn't feel too strong
this morning.

565
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,110
Mr. Mayor, do you get the impression
that she isn't terribly fond of me?

566
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,232
You see, Kate, she only likes folks
that play fair and square. . .

567
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,709
. . .because that's the way
she plays herself.

568
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,399
We don't hit it off too well.

569
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,711
Well, she wants a good man for sheriff,
just like the rest of us.

570
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,310
Don't worry, she'll cotton to you
all right, just give her time.

571
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,392
l wish she wouldn't look at me
as if her stomach were turning.

572
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,597
l'll tell you what, you come on over
and sit in on the poker game.

573
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,234
-Give her a chance to know you better.
-Does she play?

574
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,789
Play? Why, man,
she invented the game.

575
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,515
Frenchie, Bellows, Carson, Jenks,
this here is Tibbs.

576
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,439
He's our new sheriff.
Come on, boy, come on.

577
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,428
Here, he's a new hand at the game, but
he wants to sit in on it just the same.

578
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,437
Hello.

579
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,396
All right, here you are,
l'll stake you.

580
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,154
You can pay me back after the game.
Cut them, Frenchie.

581
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,351
All right, they're coming out.

582
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,237
-l have played a little, you know.
-Oh, you have? Where did you play?

583
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,630
Oh, l met two gentlemen
in St. Louis. . .

584
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,956
. . .who taught me
the rudiments of the game.

585
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,879
-The what? Oh, l see.
-Rudiments. Rather costly.

586
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,790
All right, king bets.
Frenchie, it's up to you. . .

587
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,791
-. . .what do you say?
-l bet three bucks.

588
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,195
MASTERS: Three bucks. You in?
-Yup.

589
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,630
All right, come on.
Let's get rolling here, boys.

590
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,238
Three dollars there, sheriff. Put it down
here. All right, l'm in. Coming out, boys.

591
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,911
That's too bad that missed you,
ain't it?

592
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,116
There's a queen. There's a king.

593
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,754
-A pair of deuces.
-l have a pair, Mr. Mayor.

594
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,713
-All right, you bet.
-Me to bet. Uh. . . .

595
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,156
Two, uh. . . .

596
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,157
More? All right.

597
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,912
Four. Thanks, partner.

598
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,799
Four, l raise you four, gentlemen.
Four silver dollars.

599
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,111
-Four dollars and you in?
-l'm in.

600
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,392
What do you say, boys?
What do you say?

601
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,034
Raise you five.

602
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,559
Man raises you five.

603
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,673
l'll raise you five, sir.

604
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,199
-Are you done betting?
-Yeah.

605
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,430
All right, hold it, coming out.

606
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,517
A nine.

607
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,717
A seven.

608
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,871
-Have it out between you.
-l'm to bet, l'm--

609
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,431
-A pair of deuces are still high.
-l think l'll go, um--

610
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,439
Six. Six, l raise you six.

611
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,234
Man bets $6. He sees you.

612
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,271
-Okay, what have you got?
-Pair of sixes.

613
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,158
A pair of sixes.

614
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,557
Three twos. And, gentlemen,
l think the pot is mine.

615
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,312
Take it away, sheriff, it's yours.

616
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,909
Thank you, partner.
Well done, indeed.

617
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,350
-A double snort, Chick.
-Right.

618
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,950
Hey. You see that fella over there?

619
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,879
-That's Bud Wilkins, Lazy S gunslinger.
-What?

620
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,593
Yeah, he's wearing a gun.

621
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,797
-Well, obviously if he's a slinger.
-Well, go take it off him.

622
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,191
Maybe he ain't heard
we got us a sheriff now.

623
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,155
Oh, well, l'll advise him.
That's the least l can do.

624
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,157
Your pardon, gentlemen.

625
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,230
-So you're the new sheriff.
-New, indeed.

626
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,630
l heard you ain't allowing guns
in Fractured Jaw.

627
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,837
The ruling isn't mine,
l'm merely the custodian of the law.

628
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,312
You're gonna take away
a man's gun?

629
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,274
Let's just say a chap hands it over when
he's advised of the regulations, eh?

630
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,552
l heard about you,
so maybe you heard about me.

631
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,711
l'm Wilkins.
l come to have you take my gun.

632
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,598
Well, how do you do?
Tibbs is my name.

633
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,751
All right.
You got the drop on me this time.

634
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,031
But l'm coming back.

635
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,908
And next time, l won't be alone.

636
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,232
Mr. Bud, don't forget your gun.

637
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,512
There's no law against wearing it
if you're leaving town.

638
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,394
That's the stuff, sheriff.

639
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,830
lt's remarkable, the effect this has.

640
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,950
See? How do you do?

641
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,918
That's the quickest draw l've seen
in 50 years.

642
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,190
Sheriff, the way
you handled that derringer...

643
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,033
...would make my old grandpappy
turn over in his grave.

644
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,912
l say, do you think so?

645
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,190

-lt sure does.

into my office? l want to talk to you.

647
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,590
Oh, with pleasure.

648
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,195
Boys, l never thought
l'd live to see the day. . .

649
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,112
. . .when Bud Wilkins gives up his gun.

650
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,671
You sure are fast on the draw with
that gun, mister. How do you work it?

651
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,593
lt's on a spring. And when
l straighten my arm, it pops out.

652
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,150
Well, it should pop out into my hand.
lt must need some adjust-- There.

653
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,198
Say, you know,
l'd like to have one of them.

654
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,436
To wear on my garter.

655
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,311
Great Scott. l say.

656
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,353
Of course, you could have mine,
but wearing it on that limb. . .

. . .you'd be obliged to pull the trigger
with your toe.

658

You let me worry about that.
How much you take for it?

659
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,276
l'd be honored if you'd
accept it as a gift.

660

-No. l couldn't take your gun.
-No, really, l've got others.

661

-This is just a sample.
-No, no.

662
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,071
-There we are.
-Well, thank you, thank you.

You know,
you're not a bad sort of fellow.

Well, you needn't worry about accidents.
lt isn't loaded, of course.

with an empty gun?

You think
l'd go around with a bullet in it?

668
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,635
The silly thing popped out in my hand.
l didn't mean to frighten Wilkins. . .

669
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,519
...although l imagine
it did have that effect.

670

or just plain stupid?

Well, one of us must be crazy.

What happens
if some gunslinger draws on you?

676

Well, why should they?
l've no quarrel with anyone.

677
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,552
Only with the Lazy S, because
Wilkins will get them all riled up.

678
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,474
And with the Box T outfit, because
you got mixed up in Keeno's killing.

Oh, l do think you're exaggerating.

680
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,230
That chap Wilkins offered me
his gun before he saw the derringer.

681

last night, we were the best of friends. . .

You know, l've never met
anyone like you either.

Well, let's say
l find you different, anyway.

691
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,110
At least you should know
how to handle a gun.

692
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,510
That could keep you alive
for a little while.

693
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,709
Hm.

694
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,270
Well, l don't see why skill with a gun
should be so frightfully important.

695
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,954
But if it is to you,
l suppose l could learn.

696
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,199
-Tibbs, l just decided something.
-Oh?

and try to understand.

for your chances...

than you are right now.

for a barefoot tenderfoot.

-But it's wonderful of you to offer.
-l'm not asking for your thanks.

Personally, l think l'm weak in the head

-No.

-lf there was, we wouldn't use it.

know why he didn't gun me down.

1132
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,272
He made it clear he's with Lazy S.

1133
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,432
l figured that last night.
l didn't know they'd make him sheriff.

1134
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,318
They got the law on their side now.

1135
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,954
Suppose he brings
in the U.S. Marshal or cavalry?

1136
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:01,153
He won't have time. Round up the boys.
We're riding into Fractured Jaw today.

1137
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,952
Why, the Lazy S will be in town.

1138
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:07,517
First we get the sheriff and then we
settle with the Lazy S once and for all.

1139
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,191
Whoa.

1140
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,431
Hello, sir.

1141
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,433
More damn lives than a cat.

1142
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,070
Come on. Giddap!

1143
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,439
Whoa.

1144
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,671
Put those in my room, dear boy.
Thank you.

1145
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,278
-Peace offering.
-Oh!

1146
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,874
-Well, it's just lovely.
-And so are you.

1147
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,715
Wait. When l was a little girl,
l was taught to take my medicine. . .

1148
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,599
. . .without putting it off.
You know, get it over with quick.

1149
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,034
Sign of a strong character.

1150
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,749
Well, here goes.
l'm nasty, stubborn and unreasonable.

1151
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,434
l got the rottenest temper
this side of the Rockies. . .

1152
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,797
. . .and, well, l behave
just like an old witch.

1153
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,557
Well? Well, don't just sit there,
l apologized to you.

1154
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,950
l accept your apology.

1155
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,114
ls that all you've got to say?

1156
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:31,590
You mean you believed all those things
l said about myself?

1157
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,193
With reservations.

1158
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,272
Why, you swellheaded,
narrow-minded stuffed shirt.

1159
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,790
lf you had half the brains
of a loco coyote, then you'd know. . .

1160
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,032
. . .l was right in everything l said
to you this afternoon.

1161
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,518
Well, what are you thinking?

1162
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,912
l do hope our children take after me.

1163
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,998
You know what?

1164
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,838
l hope they do too.

1165
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,793
-But not the girls.
-Even the girls.

1166
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,718
Now you're being stubborn.

1167
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,714
l'm just being in love.

1168
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,594
Hey, l hadn't even told you
about the good news.

1169
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,030
Oh, l react very well to good news.

1170
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,151
l've been showing this all over town.

1171
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,033
Not the thingamajig, of course,
just the gun.

1172
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:18,836
Everybody thinks they can be just as fast
as you are, and they all want one.

1173
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,433
You can sell enough of these. . .

1174
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,797
. . .to make Tibbs and Company
the biggest gun dealers in all the West.

1175
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,155
Kate, you're wonderful.

1176
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,992
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

1177
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:31,596
-Well, come in.
-Oh, howdy, Kate. Howdy, sheriff.

1178
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,394
That's a mighty fine load of furs
you got out there.

1179
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,036
-Why, thank you, sir.
-l run the general merchandise store. . .

1180
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,509
. . .and l got some good connections
with fur buyers.

1181
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:43,314
l thought we might make a deal,
if you've a mind to sell.

1182
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,789
Kate, it's not very difficult
to become a merchant.

1183
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,155
Trade guns for furs,
then sell the furs, simple.

1184
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:53,190
Mister, would you mind telling me
where you traded them furs?

1185
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,790
Why, certainly. l came across some
chaps who were very eager for guns.

1186
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,635
They couldn't do enough for me.
Most appreciative they were. lndians.

1187
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,592
-lndians!
-Yes, sort of--

1188
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:04,910
l drove a hard bargain,
though l say it myself.

1189
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,399
Jonathan, you couldn't have.

1190
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,637
Mister, that's just about
the lowest thing a white man ever done.

1191
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,319
You ain't no better
than a skunk.

1192
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,080
l'll thank you to keep a civil tongue
in your head.

1193
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,430
-Why shouldn't l?
-lf the lndians have guns. . .

1194
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,670
-. . .they'll wipe us all out.
-That's nonsense.

1195
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,672
Lookie here, you.

1196
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,590
lf there's any of us left alive in this here
town after them lndians get through. . .

1197
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,633
. . .we'll hang you
to the nearest cottonwood.

1198
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:32,470
Trot home and look after your
various enterprises, there's a good chap.

1199
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,159
Kate, you don't understand.

1200
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,231
These lndians have made me
a blood brother.

1201
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,914
l have their promise
not to use guns against white men.

1202
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,516
-You can't believe them.
-Oh, there's no need to feel disturbed.

1203
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,676
l'm on very familiar terms
with these men.

1204
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,479
Good heavens, we--
We call each other by our first names.

1205
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:48,959
''Good morning, Running Deer. ''

1206
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,190
''Cheerio, Fleet lron Hat. ''
l'm Fleet lron Hat.

1207
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,870
-Renegade.
-Oh, shut up!

1208
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,952
Don't you understand?
You've done the one unforgivable thing.

1209
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,839
Any man in the territory will
shoot you down on sight.

1210
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:03,157
Unless a bunch of them
get to you first and string you up.

1211
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,832
Oh. Oh.

1212
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,877
Well, l really seem to have let the cat
among the pigeons.

1213
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,238
-Doc, l hear tell they're on the way.
-lndians?

1214
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,949
Worse. The Box T.
All of them riding toward town.

1215
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,918
-lt's the Lazy S day.
-Great balls of fire.

1216
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,958
This town will be more full of holes
than a woodpecker's nest.

1217
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,394
What on earth is happening?

1218
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:29,120
They'll start shooting
the minute they see each other.

1219
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,669
The only good thing is,
you might be in the middle.

1220
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:34,440
As for me, l'm hightailing it
for the hills.

1221
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:37,154
-All right, we're leaving.
-We are?

1222
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,955
Give me a few minutes to throw
some things in a bag. You get packed.

1223
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,111
l'm not sure
l care about this running away.

1224
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,998
You stay, and you'll be carried away.

1225
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,675
Well, cowboys should be willing to listen
to reason the same as anyone else.

1226
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,072
Look, Jonathan. lt's me, Kate.
Not mad, no temper.

1227
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,430
For the first time in my life
l'm scared.

1228
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,471
-Really?
-Scared for you.

1229
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:00,195
You know, l always wanted to live
in Chicago or New York or even London.

1230
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,790
Now l don't care where we go,
just so long as it's away from here, fast.

1231
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,475
lf you want to settle in America
or England or even at the North Pole. . .

1232
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,830
. . .well, that's for me too.

1233
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,839
l won't be long.

1234
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,870
Go on, fill her up, Chick.
Fill her up.

1235
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:21,755
When that fighting starts there won't be
a drop of liquor left in Fractured Jaw.

1236
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,679
lt's a cinch there ain't gonna
be none where l'm heading.

1237
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,916
Just put this here on my bill.

1238
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:31,079
-l may live to pay it, and l may not.
-Yeah.

1239
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,474
Well, Mister Sheriff, you sure
put your foot in it this time.

1240
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,114
This here town's apt to get
wiped off the map.

1241
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:41,198
And l've got to go out
and protect the innocent citizens.

1242
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:45,313
And that, my friend,
is gonna take a heap of courage.

1243
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,270
MASTERS:
Everybody clear the street.

1244
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,636
Run for your lives, take cover.

1245
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,231
The Box T and the Lazy S outfits are
both coming to town at the same time.

1246
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:03,035
And they're loaded. Forbear.
Hide out, everybody.

1247
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,630
Everybody clear the street.

1248
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,035
Everybody take cover.

1249
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,595
That's right, take cover, take cover.

1250
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,677
Hell's gonna be a-popping
around here.

1251
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,154
WOMAN:
Come on, child, let's hurry.

1252
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,548
MAN 1 :
Take them to the church.

1253
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,915
MAN 2:
Get down and cover.

1254
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:22,352
-l see you're a-figuring to run out on us.
-l beg your pardon?

1255
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,996
Sheriff Tibbs, this whole town looked up
to you, loved and respected you.

1256
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:28,435
But you fooled us,
just like you fooled Miss Kate.

1257
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,471
A-hiding behind her petticoats.

1258
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,990
-You're pretty fond of Kate, aren't you?
-Mister, this whole town is.

1259
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,152
You tell her l shan't be long.

1260
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,635
l want a word with those ranchers.

1261
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,519
Come on.

1262
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,513
Hank.

1263
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,432
-Hank!
-Yeah?

1264
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,636
Better hitch up
that hearse of yours again.

1265
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,950
This time you got you
a dead sheriff for sure.

1266
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,270
l'll be right there.

1267
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,512
Kate, ain't no use
your hurrying. . .

1268
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,472
-. . .that fella's been and gone.
-Where?

1269
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:15,150
He said to tell you he'd be back soon
but l got my doubts about that.

1270
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,436
-Where did he go?
-Off to try and make peace. . .

1271
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,477
. . .between them crazy ranchers.

1272
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,309
That fella is either the durndest fool
or the bravest man in the world.

1273
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,750
l can't make up my mind which.

1274
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:30,108
Come on, keep moving. Giddap.

1275
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:33,073
Giddap! Giddyap!

1276
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:46,271
Giddap! Come on,
giddap there, giddap there.

1277
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,598
Hey, why'd the sheriff stop you
from being shot?

1278
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:12,116
l don't know. Pretty handy with a gun.
Could've filled me full of holes.

1279
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,078
He had a message. Used a lot of words,
but he got it across.

1280
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,708
He says the Lazy S
is heading for trouble.

1281
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,997
He ain't the first lawman
who tried to throw his weight around.

1282
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,313
He ain't the first lawman
to get killed neither. Nor the last.

1283
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,798
-Boys riding into town today?
-We usually do on Saturday.

1284
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:31,316
Ride in a bunch. No stragglers for
the sheriff to pick off one at a time.

1285
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,789
-Sure, boss.
-When we hit town, l'll get him.

1286
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:37,350
When he starts, there will be
enough of us to see he don't finish.

1287
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,909
Fractured Jaw ain't gonna have
