Is this the last one?

00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:35,103
At least
there's no gangrene.

has it been like this?

There you go.

38
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:22,530
You went
to the hospital?

39
00:05:24,434 --> 00:05:26,197
It was no good.

What's
going on here?

00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:36,578
That seems to be the question,
all right.

ask the major,

44
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:41,082
but he don't know.

He's busy.

how come
the officers' mess

All he knows is
there ain't no show.

51
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:58,260
Now, the major,

52
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:59,631
he's looking
at the general.

53
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:02,000
He's thinking
to himself,

54
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,629
"I better
do something."

55
00:06:03,706 --> 00:06:05,833
You know
what that means.

They're supposed to be
beat up just like us.

00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:16,818
Everybody knows Tucker's men
are tough as cobs.

60
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:19,821
So far the only thing
killed out here

61
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,152
is three
milking cows.

if we ain't
gonna fight...

68
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:39,575
we could just settle
this whole business

69
00:06:39,642 --> 00:06:42,042
with a little...
high-stakes poker.

be a sight?

and unless troops
arrive soon,

372
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:30,429
all may be lost.

373
00:41:37,304 --> 00:41:39,829
It's been two days now
and nothing.

374
00:41:39,907 --> 00:41:43,343
My presence here must have
been reported by now.

375
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,140
Have made all the preparations
I can think of.

376
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:48,113
Cannot mount
an adequate defense,

377
00:41:48,182 --> 00:41:51,083

a big impression

378
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:52,618

Postscript--

381
00:41:54,688 --> 00:41:56,087
The man I encountered

382
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,488
was a magnificent-looking
fellow.

383
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:00,424
[Snoring]

384
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,198
I do not care for this talk
about a white man.

385
00:42:05,299 --> 00:42:09,201
Whatever he is, he is not Sioux
and that makes him less.

386
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,363
When I hear that more whites
are coming, I want to laugh.

387
00:42:11,438 --> 00:42:12,268
We took a hundred horses
from these people.

388
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:13,601
There was no honor in it.

389
00:42:13,674 --> 00:42:17,337
They don't ride well.
They don't shoot well.

390
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:19,345
They're dirty.

391
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:24,407
Those soldiers could not even
make it through one winter here.

392
00:42:24,485 --> 00:42:28,444
And these people
are said to flourish?

393
00:42:29,523 --> 00:42:33,550
I think they will
all be dead soon.

394
00:42:36,063 --> 00:42:40,796
I think this fool
is probably lost.

395
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:48,569
Wind In His Hair's words are
strong and I have heard them.

396
00:42:48,642 --> 00:42:52,476
It's true the whites are
a poor race and hard to understand.

397
00:42:52,546 --> 00:42:54,980
But make no mistake.
The whites are coming.

398
00:42:55,049 --> 00:42:57,040
Even our enemies agree on this.

399
00:42:57,117 --> 00:43:01,110
So when I see one man alone
without fear in our country...

400
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:05,954
I do not think he is lost.
I think he may have medicine.

401
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,552
I see someone who might speak...

402
00:43:09,663 --> 00:43:12,723
for all the white people
who are coming.

403
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,236
I think this is a person with
which treaties might be struck.

404
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:25,272
Kicking Bird is always
looking ahead and that is good.

405
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:30,708
But this man cannot cover
our lodges or feed our children.

406
00:43:30,784 --> 00:43:34,652
He is nothing to us.

407
00:43:34,755 --> 00:43:36,416
I will take some men.

408
00:43:36,523 --> 00:43:38,650
We will shoot some arrows
into this white man.

409
00:43:38,759 --> 00:43:41,853
If he truly has medicine,
he will not be hurt.

410
00:43:41,962 --> 00:43:43,953
If he has no medicine,
he will be dead.

411
00:43:50,604 --> 00:43:54,005
No man can tell another
what to do.

412
00:43:54,842 --> 00:43:57,276
But killing a white man
is a delicate matter.

413
00:43:57,344 --> 00:44:01,178
If you kill one,
more are sure to come.

414
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,215
It's easy to become confused
by these questions.

415
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:14,322
It's hard to know what to do.

416
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:19,492
We should talk about this
some more.

417
00:44:20,634 --> 00:44:22,625
That is all I have to say.

00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:50,018
I don't know.
My arm doesn't work.

427
00:45:51,758 --> 00:45:55,854
You shouldn't have fallen off.
Now we'll get in trouble.

428
00:45:55,963 --> 00:45:58,557
It was your idea.

429
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:04,501
My idea was only to take
the horse, not fall down.

I have visited him and I believe
his heart is a good one.

at the fort.

that I am here.

740
01:19:48,927 --> 01:19:50,087
Yeah.

741
01:19:50,162 --> 01:19:53,757
[Speaking Lakota]

742
01:19:53,832 --> 01:19:57,097
[Cheering]

743
01:20:32,003 --> 01:20:34,494
Riders were sent
to pick up the trail.

744
01:20:34,573 --> 01:20:37,133
By the time
I gathered my things,

745
01:20:37,242 --> 01:20:39,642
the entire tribe
was well on its way.

746
01:20:39,711 --> 01:20:43,169
Their efficiency and the
speed at which they moved

747
01:20:43,281 --> 01:20:46,580
was enough to impress
any military commander.

748
01:20:46,651 --> 01:20:50,451
I've gone from a person
of suspicion

749
01:20:50,522 --> 01:20:52,717
to one of genuine standing.

750
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:54,588
I am greeted
with open smiles

751
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:56,490
and looks
of appreciation.

752
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:59,257
In short, I have become
a celebrity.

753
01:20:59,331 --> 01:21:00,798
Lieutenant!

754
01:21:00,865 --> 01:21:02,093
Lieutenant!

755
01:21:02,167 --> 01:21:03,964
Lieutenant!

756
01:21:04,035 --> 01:21:07,232
Scouts picked up the trail
where I said it would be.

757
01:21:07,339 --> 01:21:10,035
It was not hard to find--

758
01:21:10,141 --> 01:21:11,904
a gigantic swath
of torn-up ground

759
01:21:11,977 --> 01:21:14,036
extending to the horizon.

760
01:21:14,112 --> 01:21:16,876
The numbers it took
to create this image

761
01:21:16,948 --> 01:21:19,439
was hard to imagine.

762
01:21:35,267 --> 01:21:36,791
Lieutenant!

763
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:40,294
Lieutenant!

764
01:24:06,317 --> 01:24:08,615
Who would do such a thing?

765
01:24:08,686 --> 01:24:10,347
The field was proof enough

766
01:24:10,422 --> 01:24:13,914
that it was a people
without value and without soul,

767
01:24:13,992 --> 01:24:17,086
with no regard
for Sioux rights.

768
01:24:17,162 --> 01:24:19,926
The wagon tracks leading
the way left little doubt,

769
01:24:19,998 --> 01:24:24,264
and my heart sank, as I knew it could
only be white hunters.

770
01:24:24,335 --> 01:24:26,098
Voices that had been joyous

771
01:24:26,204 --> 01:24:30,163
were now as silent
as the dead buffalo left to rot,

772
01:24:30,275 --> 01:24:31,742
killed only
for their tongues

773
01:24:31,843 --> 01:24:34,368
and the price
of their hides.

774
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:38,540
[Drums Beating]

775
01:24:38,616 --> 01:24:40,550
[Whooping]

776
01:24:42,187 --> 01:24:45,213
As they celebrated
into the night the coming hunt,

777
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:47,781
it was hard to know
where to be.

778
01:24:47,859 --> 01:24:49,349
I don't know
if they understood,

779
01:24:49,427 --> 01:24:51,793
but I could not
sleep among them.

780
01:24:51,863 --> 01:24:55,390
There had been no looks,
no blame.

781
01:24:55,467 --> 01:24:57,230
There was only
the confusion of a people

782
01:24:57,302 --> 01:25:00,100
not able to predict
the future.

783
01:27:09,901 --> 01:27:13,166
[Whooping]
