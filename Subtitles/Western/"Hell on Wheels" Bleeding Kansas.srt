God's will?

189
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:00,229
What is it?

190
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:02,330
God's will.

191
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,432
That's right.

192
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,836
Good girl.

193
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:32,997
She's not herself.

194
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:36,037
I'm sure you've seen this in the war.

195
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,478
Water...

196
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:43,115
Won't chase the metal from your mouth.

197
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:45,417
It's from your heart racing.

198
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:49,086
It's what happens when you shoot a man.

199
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,457
And your hands get cold.

200
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:54,360
It'll pass.

201
00:13:54,394 --> 00:13:57,864
I killed that man.

202
00:13:57,898 --> 00:13:59,798
You ain't killed nobody.

203
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:03,001
Durant dug the bullet out of Sidney.

204
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:05,473
He's sewing him up now.

205
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:07,376
He'll hang for what he done.

206
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:32,231
We will have due process, Mr. Bohannon.

207
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:36,367
And by your hand, per that badge
on your chest, as we agreed.

208
00:14:36,402 --> 00:14:38,168
She ain't done nothing.

209
00:14:38,202 --> 00:14:40,803
You or I would have done if
circumstances were similar.

210
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,339
I want her jailed and
arraigned before the court.

211
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:46,677
Sidney snow needs to be jailed.

212
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:49,314
Soon as he's able,
he'll stand trial for murder,

213
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:52,415
be convicted, hanged, and forgotten.

214
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,717
In the event he dies first,

215
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:57,589
it must be seen that she's held accountable.

216
00:14:57,623 --> 00:15:00,424
You arrest the church lady
for shooting Sidney Snow,

217
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,360
that might be your last act
as provisional anything.

218
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:12,205
She means that much to you?

219
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:15,939
Whole town.

220
00:15:15,973 --> 00:15:20,379
Post a guard 'til we see
what Providence brings.

221
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:32,558
End of the line folks! Cheyenne!

222
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:35,092
Last stop! End of the line!

223
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:08,565
If it's trouble you bring,
you best keep walking.

224
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:11,308
We got our fill within.

225
00:16:11,343 --> 00:16:13,912
Trouble's what I seek, madam...

226
00:16:13,947 --> 00:16:16,952
In the form of Michael McGinnes.

227
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:21,090
Would you happen to know
where I might encounter him?

228
00:16:21,132 --> 00:16:25,034
I heard he left town.

229
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,993
Well, now...

230
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:30,529
Suppose it's his dear ol'
cousin who'd be asking.

231
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:32,830
Would you have seen him then?

232
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:35,319
I don't care if it's Christ himself asking.

233
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:38,213
I haven't seen McGinnes
and I don't expect to.

234
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:55,355
You're a fine bit of stuff, aren't ya?

235
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,892
The brothel, then.

236
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:07,573
[Laughing]

237
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:09,141
Well, if it isn't the ugliest mug

238
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:10,375
west of the bleeding channel.

239
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:11,840
- Johnny!
- Michael!

240
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:14,744
- How the hell are ya?
-  Oh!

241
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,848
Hungry, horny, itching to fight.

242
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:18,483
You haven't changed a bit.

243
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:20,052
Beginning to wonder you wouldn't show.

244
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:22,156
Ah, Miles of cathouses and saloons

245
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,991
between New York and here, Michael.

246
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:26,326
But none as fine as this establishment, boy.

247
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,864
Ladies! This is me cousin,
"Dandy" Johnny Shea,

248
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:33,532
and this pack of rare
Bulgarians are the dead rabbits.

249
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:35,065
Welcome, lads.

250
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:37,982
Welcome. Tell you what.

251
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:41,523
Why don't you take them upstairs

252
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:43,550
and welcome them to Cheyenne properly.

253
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:45,853
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

254
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:49,892
Go on, get up. I'll speak to me cousin.

255
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:51,058
Hell yeah.

256
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:52,827
So, uh, Michael.

257
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:56,100
Remind me now why I left me
Dan and wife in the five points

258
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:58,002
to come out to this...

259
00:17:58,037 --> 00:18:00,039
Rotten stink hole.

260
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:04,010
We're gonna extort some people,
bash some heads,

261
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:05,410
and strong-arm the governor.

262
00:18:05,445 --> 00:18:10,241
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

263
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:12,088
It's grand to see ya, Michael.

264
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,224
It's great to see ya, boyo.

265
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,298
Tell me he ain't gonna die.

266
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:22,799
I've stemmed the bleeding.

267
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:28,077
He's stable.

268
00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:29,778
I gave you ten, senorita.

269
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:32,182
You 'member that.

270
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:33,686
Drop the gun, Sid.

271
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,394
Adios, Bohannon.

272
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:40,930
You know me better than that.

273
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,567
Here, get him up. Oh...

274
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:55,312
The artery's shredded.

275
00:18:55,346 --> 00:18:57,880
I can't fix that and I
can't stop the bleeding.

276
00:18:57,914 --> 00:18:59,449
You ain't gonna let me die, doc.

277
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:01,150
We come too far now.

278
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:05,326
There's nothing more to be done, it's over.

279
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,541
Shit!

280
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,067
All right, saw it off.

281
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,994
Right above the wound and sew it there.

282
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,597
You can't be serious.

283
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:17,568
Hell no, you ain't gonna take my leg off!

284
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:18,936
Can't let you die, Sid.

285
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,476
Leg's coming off.

286
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:25,271
Bohannon!

287
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:36,007
Now you're just being cruel,
Bohannon, let him die.

288
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:39,065
He does, Campbell hangs Ruth.

289
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:41,167
Don't be absurd. He can't hang a woman.

290
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:42,902
It's been done.

291
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:44,937
There's not a jury in the
land who'll convict her.

292
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:47,238
Yeah, well I ain't taking that chance.

293
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:48,839
Got an amputation blade?

294
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:50,075
No.

295
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:52,577
And I have never amputated a leg, either.

296
00:19:52,611 --> 00:19:54,079
I'll get you through it.

297
00:19:54,114 --> 00:19:56,034
You best be building a birdhouse.

298
00:19:56,048 --> 00:19:57,881
You want to die?

299
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,136
If I do, it's gonna be with two legs on.

300
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:03,267
Well, you lost that choice
when you threw them lanterns.

301
00:20:06,592 --> 00:20:08,227
Hold him down.

302
00:20:08,261 --> 00:20:10,130
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no, hey!

303
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:12,367
You come anywhere near me
with that knife, I swear it God,

304
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:15,806
it's gonna be the last thing you do!

305
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,611
Ah! No! No no!

306
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:19,416
Look! Hey, Bohannon! Bohannon!

307
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,117
Look at me! Look at me!
Just let it loose and let me go!

308
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:22,885
Just put me on a horse!

309
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,389
Put me on a horse and I-I'll go!
I don't never come back!

310
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,658
You ain't never gonna see me again!

311
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:26,792
Come on! Come on!

312
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,594
Look! Just don't take my leg!

313
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:30,264
Just put me on a horse,
I'll go, I'll never come back,

314
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:33,501
you never gonna see me again,
I swear to God!

315
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:34,503
Don't take my leg!

316
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:37,708
[Groaning and choking]

317
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:42,481
[Screams]

318
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,455
I take no pleasure

319
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:50,162
in the prospect of sending the
church lady to the Gallows.

320
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:53,999
But that is the task laid before us,

321
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:55,967
be swift about it.

322
00:20:56,002 --> 00:20:59,136
Your friend, miss Ellison,
will need to be managed.

323
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:00,637
She's widely read

324
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:03,974
and has been critical of our policies here.

325
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:10,376
The rule of the law applies
to everyone, Judge.

326
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:14,181
Task of enforcing it is
not a pleasant burden.

327
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:17,184
I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

328
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:20,620
Couched in the right language.

329
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,723
I'll handle miss Ellison.

330
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:29,038
Campbell!

331
00:21:29,064 --> 00:21:32,667
You'll give me your ears before
you bend them elbows again.

332
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:36,011
This is here "Dandy" Johnny Shea.

333
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,579
He's a hard man.

334
00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:39,847
A bruiser.

335
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,482
And a cousin on me mother's side.

336
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:43,519
And from this day forward,

337
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:47,223
he is the new proprietor
of this establishment

338
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:50,892
and any man who takes issue with that

339
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:53,193
can take it up with meself,

340
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,595
can take it up with Johnny,

341
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,396
or with one of our good friends here.

342
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,063
Is this the coward who beat
ya when your hands were tied,

343
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:02,165
Michael?

344
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:03,733
It is.

345
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:07,902
You want to, uh,
you want to dance with me, boyo?

346
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,617
He can't save you now.

347
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:26,751
Casino is yours, Mr. McGinnes.

348
00:22:26,786 --> 00:22:28,920
Ugh!

349
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:31,057
Ahh!

350
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:34,097
Mr. McGinnes, we conceded the casino.

351
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:35,932
Johnny, that's enough.

352
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:37,469
Ahh!

353
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:40,440
I'll scoop the shite
clean out of your skull!

354
00:22:40,474 --> 00:22:43,875
Mr. McGinnes, control your man!

355
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,140
- Ahh!
- Johnny!

356
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:46,574
I said stop, let go of him.

357
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:48,109
I heard ya, Mick!

358
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:49,744
Thing is, I love ya,

359
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:51,782
but I don't work for ya!

360
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:57,818
[Screaming]

361
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,374
A madman.

362
00:23:05,595 --> 00:23:08,296
That's what they called my father.

363
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,933
Who? The newspapers?

364
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:14,646
I used to hate reporters.

365
00:23:14,672 --> 00:23:16,407
I still do...

366
00:23:16,441 --> 00:23:18,443
Sometimes.

367
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:27,937
When he left home to speak for
the Indians once and for good,

368
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:33,721
I read every article on his exploits.

369
00:23:37,994 --> 00:23:40,505
And they called him a martyr.

370
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:46,198
I'm not a martyr.

371
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:50,947
How do you see yourself?

372
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,960
I'm a mother.

373
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,515
This is going to hurt like hell.

374
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,550
No no no no! No!
Wait wait wait wait wait wait!

375
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:12,151
Ahh!

376
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:12,934
[Screaming]

377
00:24:33,868 --> 00:24:35,702
Now, Bohannon.

378
00:24:49,543 --> 00:24:54,209
- Come on, man.
- Hold still.

379
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,911
It'll go faster.

380
00:24:57,946 --> 00:25:02,249
Don't cut it off.

381
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:02,963
[Groaning]

382
00:25:45,415 --> 00:25:48,353
My condolences, miss Ruth.

383
00:25:48,387 --> 00:25:49,854
Over Ezra passing.

384
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:51,557
Thank you, Psalms.

385
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,218
What you need?

386
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,295
I'll get it for you.

387
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:56,698
No, I need to pass.

388
00:25:56,732 --> 00:25:58,803
I-I'm here to see you stay put.

389
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:03,473
Mr. Bohannon's orders.

390
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:08,581
Well, can you tell me what's
happening with Mr. Snow?

391
00:26:08,615 --> 00:26:13,216
I hear Mr. Bohannon doing
everything he can to save him.

392
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,987
Save him?

393
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:19,453
Why?

394
00:26:19,488 --> 00:26:24,425
To save you, miss Ruth.

395
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,298
I think it's best you go back inside, now.

396
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:50,592
If I'm ever on that table, want you there.

397
00:26:50,627 --> 00:26:52,930
If you're ever on that table,

398
00:26:52,965 --> 00:26:56,471
I hope I'm the one puts you there.

399
00:27:00,548 --> 00:27:03,148
It wasn't Elam in that box.

400
00:27:03,182 --> 00:27:05,119
You said so yourself.

401
00:27:05,153 --> 00:27:07,691
Elam wanted me.

402
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:11,394
He would have left quiet with me.

403
00:27:11,428 --> 00:27:12,996
And you took that from us.

404
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,729
Eva...

405
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:15,829
It was for your own protection.

406
00:27:15,863 --> 00:27:18,229
No one asked you for it.

407
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:34,575
Congratulations.

408
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:36,678
You ain't dead.

409
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:48,018
All this to see me hang?

410
00:27:48,052 --> 00:27:49,551
Nope.

411
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:52,154
First you gonna save the church lady.

412
00:27:52,189 --> 00:27:56,421
One good act ain't gonna wash
away all the bad I've done.

413
00:27:56,455 --> 00:27:59,922
What becomes of men like us, Bohannon?

414
00:27:59,956 --> 00:28:02,254
Where do you suppose we end up?

415
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:10,887
Nowheres good.

416
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,828
That bastard gonna live?

417
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:22,764
Eh,

418
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:24,763
took off his damn leg.

419
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:27,332
He gonna be meaner than before.

420
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:28,966
Not for much longer.

421
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,730
You posted a guard.

422
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:48,537
We took the leg off.

423
00:28:48,571 --> 00:28:51,838
He'll live.

424
00:28:51,872 --> 00:28:54,608
He will answer for Ezra, Ruth.

425
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:57,678
But will I answer for him?

426
00:28:57,712 --> 00:28:59,710
You'll be free.

427
00:28:59,744 --> 00:29:01,711
We'll rebuild your church.

428
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,416
You can't rebuilt what I lost.

429
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:31,096
You're a better surgeon than I was a farmer.

430
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,897
Well, from what little I know of you,
that's not saying a lot.

431
00:29:34,931 --> 00:29:36,164
[Chuckles]

432
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:44,574
I wanted to be an eye doctor.

433
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:46,742
Studied ophthalmology.

434
00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:49,643
But I never finished medical school.

435
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:52,712
Did you know that?

436
00:29:52,746 --> 00:29:55,651
'Doc' is an affectation a...

437
00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:57,251
An honorific title

438
00:29:57,285 --> 00:30:00,220
I adopted to help me in the
business of railroading.

439
00:30:00,254 --> 00:30:01,821
[Laughs] You're shitting me.

440
00:30:01,856 --> 00:30:04,795
I am not.

441
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:06,030
Damn.

442
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:14,343
What you think is gonna...

443
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:17,011
Happen to men like us?

444
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:19,112
After she's built.

445
00:30:19,147 --> 00:30:20,747
Well, I will be remembered

446
00:30:20,781 --> 00:30:22,683
as the man who built the
Transcontinental Railroad.

447
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:24,784
You will not be remembered at all.

448
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:26,920
Not even by me.

449
00:30:26,954 --> 00:30:28,657
Thanks for sugarcoating it.

450
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:30,959
[Laughs] It's the truth.

451
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:33,561
You live long enough,
you'll see I was right.

452
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:37,999
Yep.

453
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:41,138
Mm.

454
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:51,983
[Groaning]

455
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:59,232
I thought I'd see the world
one last time before I die.

456
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:01,662
Won't get far.

457
00:31:03,498 --> 00:31:04,765
God.

458
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:13,380
I saw this Union boy once,
crawl a half-mile.

459
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:17,518
Nothing from the waist down.

460
00:31:17,552 --> 00:31:22,922
He couldn't have been more than 17.

461
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:25,390
It's a hell of a sight to see.

462
00:31:26,894 --> 00:31:30,564
A man with no legs, pulling himself along.

463
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:36,237
I chased him...

464
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,840
'Til he couldn't go no more
and I pinned him with my foot.

465
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:44,081
Said, "What's your hurry, boy?"

466
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:45,916
He started looking through
his jacket right about then,

467
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:49,522
for a photograph.

468
00:31:49,564 --> 00:31:54,269
See, he wanted to see
his momma one last time,

469
00:31:54,295 --> 00:31:56,663
before he died.

470
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,219
I remember he dug all through that coat.

471
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:03,872
He looked real hard.

472
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:06,672
Kept begging me to help him find it.

473
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:14,110
I said, "Well, hell, boy.

474
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:18,324
That picture's probably
in your pants pocket."

475
00:32:22,822 --> 00:32:24,857
I had a good laugh.

476
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:34,936
We all got moments.

477
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:37,880
Every man I ever killed got one someplace.

478
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,650
Damn, Sid!

479
00:32:46,684 --> 00:32:49,185
I need to tell that church lady...

480
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,619
I never meant to hurt her boy.

481
00:32:50,653 --> 00:32:52,954
Shut up! [Groans]

482
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:04,436
I know it happens to men like us, Bohannon.

483
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:08,038
We end up far from home...

484
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:11,671
Covered in blood...

485
00:33:11,705 --> 00:33:16,478
And shit.

486
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:18,212
We die alone.

487
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,111
I said shut your damn mouth.

488
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:23,146
"Shut your damn mouth."

489
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,584
That's funny.

490
00:33:34,435 --> 00:33:35,669
Sid?

491
00:34:40,835 --> 00:34:43,971
This pleases me much.

492
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:46,064
There's a... it is a blessing to have...

493
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:50,802
To have a child who cherishes God's word.

494
00:34:56,368 --> 00:34:58,637
You are my good...

495
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,279
Good and beloved daughter.

496
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,754
"Thou shalt not kill."

497
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:13,694
Those men last night...

498
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:18,231
God sent me to them to, uh...
To avenge their sins.

499
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,171
"'Vengeance is mine.

500
00:35:27,206 --> 00:35:31,641
I will repay, ' saith the lord."

501
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:33,978
Yeah. Paul to the romans.

502
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:37,017
Satan himself does
sometimes quote scripture.

503
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,053
It's one of his foulest tricks.

504
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:41,022
"Avenge not yourselves,

505
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:43,290
but rather give place unto wrath."

506
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:45,357
Enough!

507
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:48,493
[Laughs]

508
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:56,581
What does it mean, Papa?

509
00:35:56,607 --> 00:35:58,249
When you're older the...

510
00:35:58,275 --> 00:36:01,080
The truth meanings will stand revealed.

511
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:05,219
That is why the Lord
puts our elders above us.

512
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,247
Ruth?

513
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:33,441
God doesn't avenge sins
through his creations.

514
00:36:37,143 --> 00:36:40,492
He doesn't move men to kill.

515
00:36:42,115 --> 00:36:44,085
I've met plenty of men who would

516
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,220
have you believe differently.

517
00:36:52,797 --> 00:36:56,565
You don't rely on God...

518
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:58,427
Do you, miss Ellison?

519
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:05,908
No.

520
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:08,779
Why?

521
00:37:08,814 --> 00:37:14,482
I've seen far too much of
what men do in his name...

522
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:17,587
To believe that he would
ever be there for me.

523
00:37:45,957 --> 00:37:47,825
Miss Ellison.

524
00:37:59,037 --> 00:38:01,505
You sure you want to do that?

525
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,375
Are you sure you want
to prosecute Ruth Cole?

526
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:09,013
The world is a better place
without men like Sidney Snow,

527
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:13,858
and better with women of high
moral standards like miss Cole.

528
00:38:13,886 --> 00:38:16,153
And yourself.

529
00:38:16,187 --> 00:38:19,193
John, that's not an answer.

530
00:38:19,228 --> 00:38:20,828
That's a public position.

531
00:38:20,862 --> 00:38:22,695
I'm not a fool, Louise,

532
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:25,832
but I am the Governor and all that implies.

533
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:27,000
Can I quote you on that?

534
00:38:27,035 --> 00:38:29,805
No, you cannot.

535
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,241
In fact...

536
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:36,012
I would suggest that until
this matter resolves,

537
00:38:36,056 --> 00:38:39,860
you keep it out of the newspaper.

538
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:42,522
Is that a request...

539
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:44,158
Or a threat?

540
00:38:44,192 --> 00:38:47,329
Public hysteria will not
help miss Cole's cause.

541
00:38:47,363 --> 00:38:49,431
Nor yours.

542
00:38:51,801 --> 00:38:53,035
Hmm.

543
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:16,888
He's better off.

544
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:22,029
A man like that...

545
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:25,632
Men like us...

546
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,735
We still got a job to do.

547
00:39:31,727 --> 00:39:34,143
You know what yours is.

548
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,553
I'll bring the muck wagon around.

549
