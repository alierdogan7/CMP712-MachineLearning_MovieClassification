[Door closes]

194
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,022

<i>Man: Mm...</i>

200
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,897
Hey, you want some, too, hmm?

201
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,629
Ha ha!

202
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,644
Hey, where you going, honey?

203
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,645
Moll: Ain't nothing up there...

204
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:09,818
Better things to do with
your mouth than talk.

205
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,469
[Dog barking]

206
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,582
Mm mm.

Moll: Hey.

208
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,681
[Barking continues]

209
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,019
Don't think the dog likes
much what you're doing.

210
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:49,827
What I seen, that dog don't like
much of anything.

211
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:56,095
Uh... mm mm...

212
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,007

Agh...

219

[Spits]

220
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,377
Battle.

221
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,014
Augusta: What?

222
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,149
The do.

223
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,757
Mose: His name is Battle.

224
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,933
He sure sounds like one.

225
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,600
He's a mighty big horse
for a girl like you.

226
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,602
You go on now, Augusta.

227
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,877
Someplace you got lo be?

228
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,885
Maybe. Yeah.

229
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,513
Mose: All on your own?

230
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,022
Moll: No.

231
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:23,390
She's got people.

232
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,801
Mose: Should go.

233
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,204
Go on now.

234
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,790
<i>Go.</i>

235
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,284
Mose: Go on.

236
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,323
[imitates gunshot]

237
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,802
Oh...

238
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,140
[whimpering]

239
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,583
Don't Cry.

240
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,132
Augusta: Oh...

241
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,895
Uh...

242
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,850
[Shivering]

243
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,347

00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:41,391
[whimpering continues]

[whimpering continues]

246
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,240
[Whimpers]

247
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,741
You should try and sleep.

248
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,478
Don't Want to.

249
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:42,258
I can just keep
talking till you do.

250
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,428
Augusta: I remember Daddy
telling a story

251
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,556
about a girl and her sister.

252
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:02,777
A girl who was gonna
be killed by a king.

253
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,337
What king?

254
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,643
I don't know.
Some king somewhere.

255
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,618
Why was he gonna kill her?

256
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:13,817
I guess she must've done
something he didn't like.

257
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:19,158
Anyway... the whole town shows up
for the execution,

258
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:21,323
including the girl's sister.

259
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,992
And her sister goes
over lo the girl,

260
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,438
who's crying now,

261
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,636
and she says,

262
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:37,636
“When the king asks you
if you have any last words,

263
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:40,809
"you tell him that you want me
to tell you a story."

264
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:45,015
So the king asks,
and the girl says,

265
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:48,547
"I want my sister
to tell me a story."

266
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,124
And the king grants the request.

267
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:58,066
The sister gels up
on the scaffold.

268
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:02,128
She starts telling
a story so good,

269
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,040
the king can'! Help
himself but listen,

270
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:08,806
and the dawn has came and gone,

271
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,872
and now it's twilight,
and the whole town

272
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,850
is still standing there

273
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:19,344
stock still, their hearts
in their throat,

274
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,913
and all of a sudden,

275
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:25,428
at just the most
exciting part... she stops.

276
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,861
Why?

277
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:31,095
She says to the king,

278
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:34,262
“You want to know the end?

279
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,669
“I'll tell you tomorrow

280
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,232
"if you give my sister
one more day."

281
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:42,245
Now, the townspeople know
that mean, old king

282
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,248
is gonna kill them both
for sure,

283
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:50,117
but the king, needing
to know the end,

284
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:52,746
says yes.

285
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,758
What was the story
she was telling?

286
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,421
I only remember the part
about her telling it.

287
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:02,432
Did the king kill the girl aft?

288
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,400
Well, the next day,

289
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,926
just as soon as the sister
finishes telling that story,

290
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,870
she starts another one.

291
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,898
And she steps that one
before the best part.

292
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:16,469
And the same thing happens

293
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,878
the next night

294
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,110
and the next night

295
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:23,119
and the next night,

296
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:27,112
near a thousand nights.

297
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:30,752
What happened lo the girl?

298
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,728
Well...

299
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:36,722
as long as her sister
kept telling stories,

300
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,292
she didn't have to die.

301
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,168
And her sister...

302
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,605
I think, after she told
all them stories...

303
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:56,747
the king married her.

304
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,638
[Sobs]

305
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,943

[Panting]

307
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:23,031
Mose: Didn't know you needed
your mouth to walk proper.

308
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:25,507
You know, if you were the one,
then we'd still be sitting

309
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,101
back at the whorehouse
instead of moving.

310
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,942
Well, I wouldn't actually call

311
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:33,539
what you're doing moving.

312
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,346
Are you sure we're going
the right way?

313
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,080
Road only goes one way.

314
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,213
You know as well
as I do you can go

315
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:41,520
any way you want to on a...

316
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:44,390
On a what?

317
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,361
Road.

318
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,625
Don't run away.

319
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,637
Maybe we should slop
a minute maybe, huh?

320
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,413
[Battle barking]

321
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,456
[Growls]

322
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:15,151
Man: What's he got?

323
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,425
Looks like we've gone
the right way after all.

324
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,426
[Gulping]

325
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,825
Augusta: Mmm.

326
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:02,603
Ahh.

327
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,438
The day's half over.

328
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,470
Didn't want to wake you.

329
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,982
She up, too?

330
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,949
No.

331
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,645
Mm-hmm. Yep.

332
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:24,148
Coming back to life ain't easy.
She need to rest.

333
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,158
We got anything to drink?

334
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:32,725
Yeah.

335
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,895
Goat's milk.

336
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:41,009
That is not what I meant.

337
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,204
[Snickers] Mmm.

338
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,682
It's easier the more you drink.

339
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,413
[Mad snickers]

340
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,857
Gets real easier. Ha ha ha!

341
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,328
Ha ha! Ha ha!

342
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,764
Oh, ho ho ho! Ohh...

343
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:07,234
I like the way I feel.

344
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,364
Ah...

345
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:11,897
Mad: Mmm. Yeah.

346
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:16,071
Bill the only one
your daddy let drink it.

347
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,512
He used to come back at night

348
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,449
thinking it proud.

349
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:28,020
Augusta: You was, uh,
with, uh, Bill?

350
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:32,085
I was. [Snickers]

351
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:35,063
You wanted to have his babies.

352
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,597
Ha ha ha!

353
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:49,739
You miss him?

354
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,610
<i>I do.</i>

355
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,484
Mm-hmm.

356
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,588
Augusta: What's it...

357
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,891
Go on.

358
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,801
With this moonshine in me,

359
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:16,806
I'm fixed to answer
any question you got.

360
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,142
What's it feel like?

361
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,182
You'll know.

362
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:34,189
What if I don't?

363
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,994
What if all the men killed
all the other men?

364
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,293
What if it's
the end ol the world

365
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,425
and we the last ones left?

366
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:48,663
Ain't the end of the world.

367
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:50,673
Think about all the women

368
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:52,606
sitting in their houses

369
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,100
who are supposed to be
taken, but ain't,

370
00:43:56,134 --> 00:44:00,947
learned to shoot a gun before
they learned to bed.

371
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:04,442
Learned to be a man
instead of a wife.

372
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,892
I'm hungry-

373
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,891
Did she say...

374
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,663
Hungry-

375
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,670
Mad: What did you say?

376
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,474

568
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:10,215
Mad: At my second farm,

569
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:13,716
there was this one shed
we wasn't allowed in.

570
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:18,165
All of the other buildings
had their jobs...

571
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:22,261
one for feed... one for tools.

572
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,038
There was this one shed
we was told never to go in,

573
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:33,742
not to play near it,
not to get curious.

574
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:37,513
We made up
all sort of stories...

577
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,630
Then, one day
when I was about 10,

578
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:53,429
a man told me to go to the shed.

579
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:58,538
I was going to the shed.

580
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:02,532
I would get to know.

581
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,875
I walked to the shed,

582
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:08,439

583
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:12,613
I was gonna get to know.
I was gonna get to know.

584
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:16,317
I was gonna be the one to tell
all of the others.

585
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:25,293
I opened the door.

586
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:30,327
Only thing in there
was a low cot and no windows.

587
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:36,139
I stood there a minute
so I'm sure, so sad,

588
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:40,273
wondering why we wasn't
supposed to know for so long.

589
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:49,017
And than a man come in...

590
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:51,149
and he had me.

591
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:58,999
He was so big,
and I was so small...

592
01:05:59,022 --> 01:06:02,993
so small that I didn't even know
what was happening.

593
01:06:06,763 --> 01:06:09,767
That was the first time,

594
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,643
