00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,672
LEVI:
What's the book on this horse?

167
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:20,608
She rode pretty good in Cheyenne last year
but I haven't seen her in a while.

WALT: Levi Giggs?
- Last time I checked.

169
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,951
Can I have a few seconds of your time?

170
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,088
Yeah.

171
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,855
I understand you were recently dropped
by your sponsor.

172
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,861
I quit before he dropped me.
But I drew a damn good horse today.

173
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:43,866
When I win this purse, I'm gonna expose
Chris Sublette for the village idiot he is.

174
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,402
So why did he drop you?

175
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:50,200
- Now, I just said I quit.
- You did say that.

176
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,207
Well, he said
I was messing with the stock.

177
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,543
Mistreating horses to get them
to buck harder. That's a dirty lie.

178
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,881
My daddy's a rancher.
He'd skin me alive if I mistreated a horse.

179
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,885
I'll have you know, I'm very gentle.

180
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,053
Yeah, well, I'm not.

181
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,225
So, what's the real reason
why he dropped your ass?

182
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,725
Well, you seen Chris' wife?
She's a buckle bunny.

183
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,367
I think Chris didn't like the way
she looked at me.

184
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:20,198

Heard good things.

So where were you last night?

187
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,317
- Kicking ass and chasing trim.
WALT: Ah.

188
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,989
Someone nearly beat Chris Sublette
to death in his home last night.

- Oh?
- "Oh"?

- It wasn't me, if that's what you're getting at.

[SNIFFS]

192
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,227
Like I said, kicking ass and chasing trim.

193
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,767
Did pretty good at both,
if you know what I mean.

194
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,907
If you'll excuse me, there's a buckle
with my name on it. Ma'am.

195
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,309
I think we're in love.

196
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,750
Your cell phone has a camera, right?

197
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,049
Take a picture of that.

198
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,818
I gather you saw some footprints
at the crime scene?

199
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,586
You gather right.

200
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:20,061
Print them out, see what size Levi is,
see if we got a match.

00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,333
WALT: Which vet's attached to the rodeo?
- Dennis Nunn, usually.

202
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,139
- So if someone was abusing the animals...
- Dennis would know.

You're Branch, right? Um...

Thank you.

So, uh, what was it you wanted?

Walter Longmire, 307 area code.

215
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,110
I mean, I guess everyone in the state
has a 307 area code.

216
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,186
Still, not many Walt Longmires.

Last time you wanted to talk...

...there were two dead bodies in my river.
- Yeah. Yeah, well...

...let it ring a second time,
or maybe even leave a message.

00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,577
...but they got this new invention
they call caller ID.

224
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,789
Hey, Dennis. Any reports of riders
abusing their animals?

225
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,586
Oh. You're talking about Levi Giggs,
aren't you?

226
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,490
- You know about that?
- Uh-huh.

227
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,426
The complaint came to me.

228
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:03,159
A rider said that he was using
a low-wattage cattle prod on his horses.

229
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,495
Now, we use that...

230
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,833
...but only as a last resort
to move a sick or a dangerous animal.

231
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:12,068
Levi had some version of the device
on his broncs to make them buck harder.

232
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:16,112
- Bigger the bucking, higher the score.
- Yeah, that's right.

233
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:21,880
People think horses are so strong and big,
something like that's not gonna hurt them.

234
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,455
But an electrical charge like that?
That can mess with a horse's heart.

235
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:30,254
Cause ventricular fibrillation,
sometimes even a full-on heart attack.

236

WALT: Couldn't someone have
made up the accusation?

237
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,468
Well, sure, that happens sometimes.

238
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:40,071
That's why I sent my son, Zachary,
to monitor Levi.

239
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,797
Zac's got video of Levi.

240
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,238
We showed it to his sponsors,
Levi was dropped.

241
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,776
- You know Chris Sublette?
- Sure.

00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,277
I tell you this.

243
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,883
Most sponsors? They could give a damn
if a rider tortures broncs...

244
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,212
...as long as that rider
brings home purses.

00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:57,446
- I'm gonna need you to sign off on this.
- Yeah. Not Chris.

246
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,557
He dropped Levi right away.

00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,091

into a coma last night.

like that?

you can hurt a man.

00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,098
- So you saying he wasn't?
- He was being responsible.

260
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,796
He called because he'd had a few beers.
On the way out, the call came in.

Levi lied to us.

268
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,831
...that Levi was using some kind of device
to shock his horses.

269
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,493
- So Levi's not as gentle as he said.
BRANCH: I asked around.

270
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,969
Levi hasn't won in over a year.

It's hard to know beyond size and style.
It's some kind of a riding boot. Size 11.

This looks like a buckaroo heel.

into Levi's whereabouts last night.

I went to her hotel.

284
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,913
She checked in around 9:00.
And the room-service waiter said...

285
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,581
...he brought dinner to her and her husband
around 9:40.

286

You think he's good-looking?

Think Julia arranged a hit on her husband
to get out of the marriage?

What are you talking about?

Who are you sleeping with?

311
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,622
- That's none of your business.
- That's not how I see it.

312
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:04,993
If it relates directly to the assault
on Chris Sublette...

313
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,401
...I believe it is absolutely my business.

314
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,804
And obviously your duty
to tell me about it.

315
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:23,984
I know you heard about me being
supposedly drunk at the crime scene.

316
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,351
There's only two people
could have told you that.

317
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,551
Vic or Julia Sublette.

318
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,663
Now, Vic says it wasn't her
and I believe her.

319
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,896
So I'm gonna ask you again.

320
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,870
Are you sleeping with the victim's wife?

321
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,930
No.

322
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,000
Hell, no.

323
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,668
Do you know the victim's wife?

324
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,041
No.

325
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,210
Never met her.

326
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,008
Well...

327
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:00,624
...if neither Vic nor Julia Sublette...

328
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,193
...mentioned my drinking to you...

329
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,554
...who did?

330
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,732
If you're going door-to-door
looking for campaign donations...

331
