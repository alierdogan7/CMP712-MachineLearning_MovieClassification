1
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,148
Looks like farmland down there.

2
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,308
We stopping someplace? I
got a shoe ain't lasting.

3
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:04,145
They'll all need attention before
we head into that north range.

4
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,825
Talk about the tail end of nowhere.

5
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,235
Might be a sheepherder along that crick.

6
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,567
Norman, you and Earl see
if you can locate a herder.

7
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,809
Find out what's ahead of us.

8
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,587
Today's the day Reverend
Broyles comes to town, Johnny.

9
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,958
- I didn't forget.
- Well, you better hurry.

10
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,930
He'll likely travel the cool
of the day and be in about noon.

11
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,626
This will be the last one, boys.

12
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,797
You mean church day's coming
in the middle of the week again?

13
00:02:55,975 --> 00:03:00,002
Well, I'd just as soon hear a more respectful
way of putting it, but the answer's yes.

14
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,011
Why can't Mr. Broyles come on Sundays...

15
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,309
...when we have to read
the prayer book anyway?

16
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,714
Because he has to cover the whole county.

17
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,480
Can't be in a dozen
different places the same day.

18
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,923
I'll leave you hitch
the team while I wash up.

19
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:52,861
If Mr. Broyles doesn't come, do we still
have to make believe it's a church day?

20
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,097
You know, you fellas just
might not make out too well...

21
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,830
...on the day somebody says
you either go up or you go down.

22
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,032
We like church better when you
read us the prayer book on Sundays.

23
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:09,173
- You don't take so long to finish.
- Just hitch up the horses.

24
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:25,892
You know, I think I'm gonna make a start
getting some early barley into the ground.

25
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:30,097
Talking to old man Collins the other day.

26
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,036
He thinks maybe the price
gonna come back this year.

27
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:38,974
on your way to town, you might see if
Dulcie could take some time to visit me.

28
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:43,411
All right. old Collins, he's
got barley clear to the crick.

29
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,914
You might tell Dulcie to
bring some things with her...

30
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,454
...in case she has to stay a day or two.

31
00:04:54,494 --> 00:05:00,433
You know, the boys are gonna
be a great help to me this year.

32
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,295
They just...

33
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:14,472
You mean, you want me to tell Dulcie
because you're gonna ha...? You're gonna...?

34
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,638
Because you're...? It's time?

35
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,019
It's time, Johnny.

36
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,485
It's time?

37
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,555
If the doctor gets here on time, fine.

38
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,992
If he doesn't, I'll manage
with Dulcie and Mrs. Sawyer.

39
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:35,395
Tell Dulcie to stop for Mrs. Sawyer.

40
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,570
The doctor said it'd be early. I
don't want you to worry about it.

41
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,800
Not worry? Why, I can't forget
what happened the last time.

42
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,207
oh, Johnny, I feel so good. I know
everything's gonna be all right.

43
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,214
Well, listen, I'll go into town, I'll get
a good riding horse and go to Sweetwater.

44
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,852
- No, it's too late for all that.
- It's too late?

45
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,956
If the doctor's not on his way
already, we'll manage without him.

46
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,388
I want you to take the
boys into town for church.

47
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,790
Church? I'm not going to
church. I'm gonna stay...

48
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,157
Now, the Reverend Broyles makes a long trip.

49
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,027
- We should have a fair attendance for him.
-  Henrietta...

50
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,635
Ask Mrs. Littlejohn to
keep the boys for the night.

51
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,896
That'll be one worry off my mind.

52
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,706
And another will be you.

53
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,407
I want you to stay with the boys.

54
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,476
You know Dulcie would never
stand for having you underfoot.

55
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,176
oh, well, you know how much
I care what Dulcie stands for.

56
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:32,755
But we will be dependent on her, so
we can't have quarrelling, can we?

57
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,759
You stay busy thinking up
a name for our new daughter.

58
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,208
Sure prettying up herders
these days, ain't they?

59
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,739
I'm just sitting. Sheep's Mr. Robbins'.

60
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,975
We lost our bearings, gal. Is there
something up ahead you might call a town?

61
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,714
- Firecreek's all.
- Hey, girl.

62
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,951
That spitting distance or what?

63
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,823
About four miles, I reckon.

64
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,734
Long time since I seen a
gal sprouting hair like that.

65
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,929
No need to get skittish, gal.

66
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,032
I'm old enough to be your grandpa.

67
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,740
Way he's been around, honey,
don't lay no money he ain't.

68
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:08,752
Say, Norman. A scalp like this would be
worth a horse or two in Sioux trading.

69
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,585
Can't be a young buck this whole valley
worth his salt, a gal that skittish around.

70
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,058
What's going on here?

71
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,825
Come on up there, girl. Come on up.

72
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:33,062
- The girl got herself wet falling in, Bob.
-  I did not fall in.

73
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,436
- They was scaring me.
- That's all it was, just a little scared.

74
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,577
You have a dress there to pay for.

75
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,712
Sure. Sure thing, Bob.

76
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,874
Pretty dress for a pretty girl
ain't never a waste of money, honey.

77
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:52,787
- I ain't never had no $5 before.
- Got it now, honey.

78
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,230
You're a pair of fools.

79
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,030
I don't suppose you took the time to
find out if there's a town up ahead.

80
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,606
Yeah, place called
Firecreek. About four miles.

81
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,243
We'll water and rest the horses
here in case we go right through.

82
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,478
She say she got scared, huh?

83
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,284
Ain't nothing like a dollar changing
a female's way of thinking, Drew.

84
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,983
Yeah.

85
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,290
You ain't got no cause to beat me, Mama.

86
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,992
What barn you been rolling in?

87
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,960
I ain't been no place.
Just down to the crick.

88
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,931
- How did your dress get into that state?
- Just down at the crick, I fell in.

89
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,332
It's that Abbott boy. I
seen him headed that way.

90
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,064
Mama, I swear, he wasn't nowhere...

91
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,266
Wasn't around. I told him you
didn't want him fooling around me.

92
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,038
- What is that?
- Something I found.

93
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,045
That's how I fell in.

94
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,748
Seeing a gold piece in the crick
shining up at me, grabbing for it.

95
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,430
I'll put it away for you.

96
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:17,296
I figured I'd be buying me a new
dress with that there money, Mama.

97
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,406
You got enough dresses.
You get one on for church.

98
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,247
You boys stay here.

99
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:48,289
Morning, Dulcie. Well, it looks
like it's time for Henrietta.

100
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,061
She was wondering if you and
Mrs. Sawyer would come over.

101
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,704
Henrietta in labor?

102
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:57,808
- I never asked her that.
- Could be a matter of some interest to you.

103
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,073
- Where are you and the boys staying?
- oh, at Miss Littlejohn's house.

104
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,115
Let Leah ride with you. Ask
Bertha if she can put her up too.

105
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,412
That's fine. That's fine. I'll do that.

106
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,654
I'll be at the Cobb farm tonight.

107
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:18,058
Now, you ride in with them and you
stay with Bertha Littlejohn, you hear?

108
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,891
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,559
- Morning, Mr. Cobb.
- Morning, Leah.

110
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,967
- Got hay for the livery?
- Yeah, they're about out.

111
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,834
You smell like barber water.

112
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,841
Now, that's not very good
manners, telling a lady she smells.

113
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,808
But she does.

114
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,666
Just bury me here.

115
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,278
We'll take an hour, no more.

116
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,330
Sure ain't no town we gotta hurry through.

117
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,805
Something to think about, Bob.

118
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,771
You resting in bed a little,
maybe get that bleeding stopped.

119
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:17,108
Boarding house, place to eat up there,
means they get a stage coming through.

120
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:21,743
There ain't gonna be one every day.
Wouldn't worry me none if it did.

121
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,788
I swear, you and dirt's getting less
fussy about each other every day.

122
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,222
That's a horse trough.

123
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,953
Shoot.

124
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,200
You been told to keep your hands off me, boy.

125
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,112
Well, ain't you dirty now.

126
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,256
Come on, boy.

127
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,889
Had him in there a long time, Johnny.

128
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:55,101
Folks hereabouts might not like
somebody drowning in their livery trough.

129
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,179
Well, I guess I'm saying
it'd be better you let him up.

130
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,587
How'd you like to take his place?

131
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,262
Well, no, naturally, I wouldn't.

132
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,124
Man don't mind his own business...

133
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,892
Maybe you don't realize
you're talking to our sheriff.

134
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,979
Now, you boys go and play
until the preacher comes.

135
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,554
- And don't get too far.
- Yes, Pa.

136
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,985
Come on, Arthur, give me a hand here.

137
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:20,351
- Jail there, all right.
- Didn't figure on no law in a hundred miles.

138
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,960
Hold it down, Drew.

139
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,892
You think I'm gonna let him get away...?

140
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:51,322
- Sorry if my partners' fooling got to you.
- oh, sure.

141
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,289
We're just passing through.

142
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:02,128
Take it you're not a full-time sheriff, huh?

143
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,299
No.

144
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,529
What you might call an honorary position.

145
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,770
First time I ever heard
of a farmer-sheriff before.

146
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,003
Johnny gets $2 every month for being sheriff.

147
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,407
Now, how about that.

148
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,446
Kind of slow in coming sometime too.

149
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,678
For a farm town, you got pretty
good accommodations up the street.

150
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,482
Place to eat, rooms.

151
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,524
Well, it's the overnight
stop for the Sweetwater stage.

152
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,389
It comes through every Saturday.

153
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:37,596
If I sound nosy, we may be bringing
a herd up this way come spring.

154
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,930
Might put up here instead of Sweetwater.

155
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,164
Town's always glad to get business.

156
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,545
Two hours enough for
you to check their shoes?

157
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:54,411
oh, the regular livery man's
away. He does the shoeing.

158
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,583
Johnny! I can do that, Johnny.
I've watched enough now.

159
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,126
All right, Arthur, you can do it.

160
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,086
Thank you, Johnny.

161
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,867
This town could really grow on you.

162
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,429
If he gets in trouble,
I'll take over for him.

163
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,038
What, did you hurt yourself or something?

164
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,203
My horse rolled, coming across the
rocks. Feels like a cracked rib.

165
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,644
Well, the doctor from
Sweetwater's on his way here.

166
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:29,116
My missus is expecting. We're sort
of hoping he gets here tonight.

167
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,116
Thanks. Be out of here by then.

168
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,497
Bob, no stage till Saturday...

169
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:49,004
...a sodbuster for a sheriff.
What's chasing us out?

170
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,573
Horses could use a rest, Bob.

171
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:54,143
- I say we stay the night.
- It ain't your say.

172
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,544
Well, I'll get a couple of hours'
sleep and take a look at this.

173
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,685
Get some food in you.
We'll talk about it later.

174
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,265
Mr. Whittier!

175
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,366
How much is this dress?

176
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:31,478
Well, those... Those frilly
ones, I'm asking $3, Leah.

177
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,551
If I bought it, could
you trust me for a while?

178
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,949
I'll put it on your mother's account.

179
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,285
No, no. I mean trust me, personal.

180
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,187
Well, now, Leah, just how you going
to hide a new dress from your mother?

181
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,297
Mr. Whittier, I am of age.
I can buy me a new dress.

182
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,098
We'll keep it between us.

183
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,571
I'll go change in the back.

184
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,515
You know what I'd like to do someday, Johnny?

185
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:08,414
- Raise horses.
- Well, no reason why you can't.

186
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:16,787
Yeah, but that'd take a heap of money
to raise horses, wouldn't it, Johnny?

187
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:20,659
Well, save a little out of your pay
every month, you'll find it mounts up.

188
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,801
Yeah. I'll have to do that.

189
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,529
one thing you ought to stop doing, though...

190
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,697
...is keep buying things
for people all the time.

191
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,968
I like to buy presents for people, Johnny.

192
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,409
Well, that's all very well and good,
but the way to get a horse farm...

193
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,674
...is to put away a dollar
for every dollar you spend.

194
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,641
See?

195
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,095
I'm always fooling myself.

196
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,295
I'm not smart enough to raise horses.

197
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,404
Well, I don't know, Arthur.

198
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:11,341
I don't know. I'd say if you did go
out and get yourself some horse land...

199
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,787
...there would be a lot
of people missing you.

200
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,650
- Missing me, Johnny?
- I know Mr. Edelman says...

201
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,090
...he doesn't know what he'd do
without you helping him around here.

202
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,130
- Did he say that?
- Well, yeah, sure he did.

203
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,731
Johnny. Johnny, where are
they from? Did they say?

204
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,632
- No, they didn't.
- You didn't even ask them?

205
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,400
No. I don't make it my business
asking strangers where they're from.

206
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:41,910
You saw how they acted. I wouldn't be
surprised but they were wanted someplace.

207
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,139
I don't see that's any of my business either.

208
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,683
Well, I think a close eye
should be kept on them, Johnny.

209
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,447
- Now, I think you really ought to do that.
-  Mr. Hall.

210
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:51,953
I've got enough on my mind...

211
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,887
...without wondering about
people passing through town.

212
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,290
Salutations, brethren.

213
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,764
The Almighty has given us a glorious day.

214
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,991
But, Johnny. Johnny...

215
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,500
Afternoon, Reverend.
Everything ready for you.

216
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,934
Bless you, Mr. Whittier.

217
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:14,238
- Afternoon, Reverend.
- Mr. Cobb, it's always my pleasure.

218
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,243
It's nice to see you looking well.

219
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,815
I wanted to ask, have you seen
the doctor anywhere in your rounds?

220
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,452
Illness in town, Mr. Cobb?

221
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,056
Well, the doctor said he'd make
it a point to get an early start...

222
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,623
...around the county this
month, for my wife's sake.

223
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,453
oh, yes, Mrs. Cobb.

224
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:33,120
I can tell you she hasn't got a worry
in this mortal world, God bless her.

225
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,858
- Not a worry.
- Well, then the doctor's headed this way?

226
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,366
- Mr. Cobb, she's a
God-fearing woman. - Yes, sir.

227
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,064
Faith will sustain her. Services
will begin promptly at 3:00.

228
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,041
You may assist me by informing those along
the street, if you will. Mr. Whittier.

229
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,216
See how it spins, huh? Yeah.

230
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,931
Hey, girl, he's your babe?

231
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,800
Yes.

232
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,066
Mite lighter, ain't he?

233
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,347
You full-blooded?

234
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,484
Yes.

235
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,711
Kid ain't.

236
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:50,630
Hey, husband come along with the kid?

237
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,311
Hey, Indian. Now, he's talking to you.

238
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,312
No.

239
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,620
Town ain't been as quiet as it looks.

240
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,064
This may not heal a cracked
rib bone, Mr. Larkin...

241
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,864
...but never heard of it
hurting one, like they say.

242
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,739
Thank you.

243
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,702
Don't get many travelers
in the middle of the week.

244
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,973
Just staying the night?

245
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,141
- Be riding on before dark.
- Your room is ready, Mr. Larkin.

246
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,554
Well...

247
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,117
...hope that gets you to sleep.

248
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,727
Sure help. Nice talking to you, Mr. Pittman.

249
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,305
This way.

250
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:20,020
- Your grandfather's quite a talker.
- He hasn't much else to do.

251
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,402
Hope it's not too much to ask...

252
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,565
...think you can find something
I could use for bandages?

253
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,242
Maybe some hot water.

254
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,241
I think so.

255
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,428
My, how pretty we look today.

256
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,758
You're kind, ma'am.

257
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,629
How's Henrietta, Johnny? I see
she didn't come in with you.

258
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:01,932
She's fine. Well, I'm... I mean,
this is her time, Miss Littlejohn.

259
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,597
Dulcie's out there with her now.

260
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,406
Anything I can do?

261
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,738
Well, there is one thing.

262
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,574
Henrietta wondered if you'd
take care of the boys tonight.

263
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,046
Why, of course.

264
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,345
Dulcie mentioned maybe Leah
wouldn't be too much trouble, either.

265
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,044
oh, none of them are any bother.

266
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,452
I got room enough to
rattle around in over there.

267
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,593
Put the boys up in the attic.
Extra bed there for you too.

268
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,228
Fine.

269
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,558
You'll have to be throwing
a party, huh, Johnny?

270
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:30,599
one they'll hear all the way to Sweetwater.

271
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,608
Whole damn town fits in a store...

272
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,371
...and still we gotta
sleep in the hills tonight.

273
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,379
Bob plays it safe. Ain't
nothing wrong with that.

274
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,677
There's a difference between playing
it safe and being an old woman.

275
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,446
Earl, I'm coming more around
to your way of thinking.

276
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,351
We could've cut over to Sweetwater...

277
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,584
...and had ourselves a real
night's entertainment...

278
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,629
...before we hit the high country.

279
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,595
Plenty of time for that when
we get the territory behind us.

280
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,894
Bob uses his head, and I'll
stick with a thinking man.

281
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,864
This whole valley must
be full of skittish gals.

282
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,346
No need to run, honey. You
passed inspection real fine.

283
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,949
The food is on the stove.

284
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,787
Well, times have changed, grandpa.

285
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:28,255
Gal likes a little cooing first.
You just can't grab her like that.

286
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:31,862
My age, son, you gotta take
shortcuts. Minutes count.

287
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:06,224
Here's hot water and bandages. I'd
advise you to have that taken care of.

288
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:07,796
Miss?

289
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,368
- Is it "miss"?
- Yes.

290
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,061
I figure you wouldn't fall
over in a dead faint...

291
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,070
...putting another bandage on me.

292
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:20,507
The amount of blood on that shirt
shows you're carrying a bullet.

293
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,168
That calls for a doctor.

294
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,976
I managed some doctoring
last night. The bullet's out.

295
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,241
How did it get there?

296
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:32,750
Wasn't a lawman, if that's concerning you.

297
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:01,946
You don't take after your grandfather
much in the way of talking.

298
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,488
Not that I much complain when
a woman keeps her mouth shut.

299
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,596
I find no complaint when a man does the same.

300
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,143
Here, I'll take him for a while.

301
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:57,598
Now, brethren, I ask you, does
the Lord God have compassion?

302
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,640
of course he does.

303
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:05,511
But should compassion be extended
to those who knowingly defy?

304
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:06,911
To those who would...

305
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:10,543
How do they expect us to get our
supplies with all that hollering going on?

306
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,782
- who walk hand in hand with Satan?

307
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,687
Sure does bring it up from the gut.

308
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,125
- the defilers, to the spoilers?

309
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:22,892
Yea, even the fires of hell...

310
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:26,798
...will not even the
score of the transgressor.

311
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,940
He is a man doomed to eternal affliction.

312
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:34,909
A man who will kneel, bloody,
in the dust of his creation.

313
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,379
A man who will scream the
anguish of a pitiful soul...

314
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:45,147
...who has neglected the word of
the Almighty when evil beckoned.

315
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:48,520
No man escapes...

316
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,005
Come in, come in.

317
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,113
No man escapes his day of reckoning.

318
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,843
To each falls an accounting.

319
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:20,013
Payment is demanded of ye,
and payment will be made.

320
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:24,457
When he saith, "I cometh to be
paid what is due my house"...

321
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,689
...the Lord God does not speak of...

322
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:35,365
There will be no drinking during services.

323
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:43,677
Well, you don't mind us,
preacher, we don't mind you.

324
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,313
Drew. That's not bad
for store-bought whiskey.

325
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,983
It's been the town custom to close
the store when we have church.

326
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,956
Appreciate you fellows waiting a bit.

327
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,231
Well, what happens if a man
needs supplies in a hurry?

328
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,802
Well, that never came up before.

329
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,397
Well, it's come up now.

330
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,238
We can wait.

331
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:28,324
Now, maybe a man or two here thinks
the Book of Judgment don't apply.

332
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:31,553
That he can take pleasures in falsehoods...

333
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,596
...pleasures in exploiting
his brother's sorrows.

334
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:38,929
Well, to him comes damnation a thousandfold.

335
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:44,302
To him comes the devil's branding
irons, heated to his tortured flesh.

336
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:48,844
Yea, there are some who will
suffer the eternal desert...

337
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:52,073
...the eternal thirst of the unbeliever.

338
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:58,485
Whither goest thou? What trail?
What road? What awaits ye?

339
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:02,183
The fires of hell. The burning pit.

340
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,692
Ye say not for you.

341
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:09,526
From corruption given,
corruption will be received.

342
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,533
What mockery have ye traded for his word?

343
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,866
What part of thy soul have
ye traded for damnation?

344
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,031
- Shut up.
- Well...

345
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,918
You been staring straight at me.

346
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,179
Well, I ain't asking for no preaching.

347
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:35,519
I have stirred thee,
friend. It was my intention.

348
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,895
Well, being so smart, your stirring's over.

349
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,531
Meaning your cat-howling.
Meaning this church.

350
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:50,832
Now, it may be, mister,
you don't like the sermon.

351
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:54,000
A lot of people in this
town don't come to hear it...

352
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,578
...and Mr. Broyles would
be the first to tell you...

353
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,079
...he doesn't get 100 percent attention.

354
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:03,011
But all these people here have
come to listen to the preacher...

355
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:06,588
...and anybody doesn't like
what he has to say can leave.

356
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:09,157
Sure a mouthful for a sodbuster.

357
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,057
You're forgetting again,
you're talking to our sheriff.

358
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,198
Wasn't talking to you, limp-brain.

359
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,065
I think, mister, you better leave.

360
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,534
We can get our supplies later.

361
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,777
Sit down.

362
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:47,195
I have no animosity for thee,
friend. Go with my blessing.

363
00:37:57,141 --> 00:38:01,976
Johnny. Johnny, I think you ought
to tell those fellas to move on.

364
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:05,479
You don't tell somebody to leave
town because he's got bad manners.

365
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,210
Well, where are those men
from? Where they heading?

366
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,910
Those questions should be asked.

367
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,078
Miss Littlejohn, where these men are from...

368
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:15,248
...and where they're headed
is none of my business.

369
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:18,293
I think we'd better get
on with the services here.

370
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,230
Maybe a good hymn or two will clear the air.

371
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:25,893
Suppose we try "Rock of Ages," page 11.

372
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,020
I thank you, Miss Evelyn.

373
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,889
I'm gonna be feeling a lot better going on.

374
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,827
I don't see how you're
going to ride with that.

375
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,229
Some things you just do.

376
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,068
You're missing church.

377
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:02,569
It's not the first time.

378
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,275
Before, when I was asleep,
you were watching me.

379
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,608
- You reminded me of somebody.
- Who?

380
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,446
That's not important.

381
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:24,420
I usually figure my women. You come harder.

382
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,620
I'm not your women.

383
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,895
Just wasn't making any sense to me...

384
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:34,060
...somebody like you winding
up in this cemetery of a town.

385
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,336
Thanks again for the bandaging.

386
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,090
Franklin, look.

387
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,032
- My utmost thanks to you, Mr. Whittier.
- Reverend.

388
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:08,671
And if you'll kindly relay
my regards to Mrs. Cobb.

389
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,500
Thank you, sir.

390
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,417
Well, where you headed now, Reverend?

391
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,581
I'll do some visiting through the foothills.

392
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,319
Maybe get a little marrying
done among those trappers...

393
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:33,963
...least the ones that don't see me coming.

394
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:38,558
I guess they'd scatter at that.
Kind of free souls up there, huh?

395
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:43,370
There is no such thing
as a free soul, Mr. Cobb.

396
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,634
The expression never sits with me.

397
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,540
We are the Lord's children, bound to follow.

398
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,907
I might have used a better choice of words.

399
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:02,689
The next time out, I'd like you to stop
off the night with me and Henrietta.

400
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,091
Supper and a soft bed instead of
you being on the trail all the time.

401
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,527
That's an invitation, Mr.
Cobb, I'll hold in mind.

402
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,860
- Good day, Reverend.
- Good day.

403
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,637
We saw Buffalo Bill doing that.

404
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,001
He came to Sweetwater in a circus.

405
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,733
He ever do anything like this?

406
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,951
Reverend. Reverend, are
you hurt? Are you hurt?

407
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,748
No.

408
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:37,420
Well, I've sure done some
fool things in my time...

409
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,295
...but that takes the cake.

410
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,863
The young'uns got to talking
about trick shooting...

411
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,659
...and I kind of got carried away.

412
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,995
Sure hope you have a
forgiving nature, preacher.

413
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,637
I think you did that on purpose.

414
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:50,706
Miss Littlejohn, why don't you
take the boys down to the house.

415
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,342
Children.

416
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,104
Mister, why did you fire that gun?

417
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:01,882
I told you, sheriff. Boy wanted
to see some trick shooting.

418
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,881
Sure hope you're accepting
my apologies, Mr. Preacher.

419
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,046
No harm done, Mr. Cobb.

420
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,276
Well, that's real generous
of you, Mr. Preacher.

421
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,216
Sure wouldn't do me no
good, you being mad at me.

422
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,565
- Sure you're all right, Reverend?
- Yeah.

423
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,602
Here, I'll help you.

424
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,079
How you making it, Bob?

425
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,445
What am I supposed to do, keep
a rein on you 24 hours a day?

426
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:10,451
Town's real friendly, Bob. No problems.

427
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,714
We kind of talked it over among ourselves...

428
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,723
...and we decided maybe we
could leave early in the morning.

429
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,758
I'll go along with them on that, Bob.

430
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,793
Couldn't be no better place for staying.

431
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:23,923
Pull out tomorrow with the horses
rested and you feeling a lot better.

432
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:30,033
- All right.
- We do anything for you?

433
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:32,573
Keep away from that farmer.

434
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,205
Johnny. Johnny, I just
been telling Arthur here...

435
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,974
...you could maybe arrest
those men and put them in jail.

436
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,776
Arrest them for what?

437
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,378
on suspicion they're wanted someplace.

438
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,989
Now, if you put them in jail...

439
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:50,649
...you could send somebody to
Sweetwater for the marshal there.

440
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,991
You talk like I was the
regular sheriff of this town.

441
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,827
I'm a farmer with a family to take care of.

442
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,163
And what's more, I got
a wife that's pregnant...

443
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,305
...and maybe gonna have a hard time of it.

444
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,237
We'd feel better if you
stayed in town, Johnny.

445
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,435
I'm gonna stay in town.

446
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:11,110
Look, Johnny, if you're
worried about Henrietta...

447
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:14,250
...I can go out to the
farm and stand by for you...

448
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,751
...and then drive into town
as soon as anything happens.

449
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:21,084
Well, now, you have an idea there, you know.

450
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:25,024
That Dulcie, she objects to
having a husband around...

451
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:28,631
...and it'd be a great help to me
if you'd go out there, Mr. Hall.

452
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,290
Well, I'll go and lock up my shop now.

453
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:37,132
You need any help any time with
those men, Johnny, you just tell me.

454
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,333
Well, nothing to worry about now, Arthur.

455
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,536
Why don't you see about shoeing these horses.

456
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:45,045
Well, don't you forget. I'm your deputy.

457
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,217
You forgot.

458
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,681
oh, no. No, no, I didn't forget.

459
00:44:55,426 --> 00:45:00,329
No, I didn't forget, Arthur. If I
need your help, I'll call on you.

460
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,092
I'll call on you.

461
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,673
Just ain't proper.

462
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,475
What ain't proper, grandpa?

463
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,977
Girl wasting all that
energy on them windows...

464
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,652
...me over here in a fix.

465
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,253
She'd beat you down without even half trying.

466
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:36,989
Your lack of faith disturbs me, boy.

467
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,906
What's going on?

468
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:55,417
Looks like whatever goes on in this town...

469
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,679
...goes on in that back room.

470
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:10,432
I haven't dropped by in a few days.

471
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,529
You know I don't mind.

472
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:15,797
There'd been talk, I guess you noticed that.

473
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,866
How's Henrietta?

474
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:24,480
Well, it's maybe like before,
a long time in happening.

475
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,440
Meli, we managed it wrong.

476
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,918
You coming to town, me saying nothing.

477
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,488
Sometimes silence is best.

478
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:36,683
No, no, we just managed it wrong.

479
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,028
Talk will stop when I'm gone.

480
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:43,257
No, but that's another thing. It's
driving you away from this town.

481
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:49,664
Johnny, but for you bringing me here,
there was nowhere I could have gone.

482
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,401
And now I have earned enough
money to settle in another town.

483
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:55,344
And I am grateful.

484
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,271
Going to another town isn't the answer...

485
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:00,712
...like going to your
village wasn't the answer.

486
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:02,977
Meli, I want you to stay in Firecreek...

487
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,986
...and I want us to say something,
bring it out in the open...

488
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,953
...like I wanted to do when you came.

489
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:11,060
Johnny, it's too late now.

490
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,454
- People will think that...
- Maybe I don't care what they think.

491
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,360
You must care.

492
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,862
This is your home.

493
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:31,112
Why are you so nervous, Mr. Hall?

494
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:36,014
Nervous? Well, this is a kind of a
nervous thing, this having a baby.

495
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,517
Your first?

496
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,321
That's a joke, Mr. Hall.

497
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:46,421
Why don't you just go outside
and make yourself comfortable...

498
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,565
...and we'll call you if we need you.

499
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,132
Everything's gonna be all
right in there, isn't it?

500
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,702
Well, if it isn't, you'll
be just about as helpful...

501
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,898
...as that doctor who seems to be
on the other side of the county.

502
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,016
Dulcie, you've no patience with the menfolk.

503
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,612
Well, they come in all sizes, Miss Sawyer...

504
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:13,688
...but I've yet to find one
that's worth a woman's patience.

505
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,636
Arthur. You finished with your work?

506
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:40,476
Johnny's finishing for me.
Said he had nothing to do.

507
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,051
- There's some root beer inside...
- Mr. Whittier?

508
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,851
You think that something bad is gonna happen?

509
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,596
You worry too much about
what you hear said, Arthur.

510
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,664
Well...

511
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,428
...it'll be night soon...

512
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,138
...and that's when things happen.

513
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,143
Yes?

514
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:20,551
Did you want anything?

515
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:25,991
If you're any good at small talk, it
always manages to bore me to sleep.

516
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,591
Seriously, if you've got
nothing better to do...

517
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:34,431
...sit down.

518
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:43,012
Strange feeling, lying here.

519
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:48,007
Like I've suddenly been left naked.

520
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,009
No defenses.

521
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:54,212
I imagine it's a natural
feeling every wounded man has.

522
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,086
Especially if somebody's following.

523
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,687
Who said there's anybody following?

524
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,963
It's obvious you and your
men are hired killers...

525
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:04,362
...down from the northern range wars.

526
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,126
We work in the open.

527
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,430
Eat and drink with the ranchers who hire us.

528
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:10,971
As much respected as anybody in the country.

529
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,769
Don't quibble any fine
line with me, Mr. Larkin.

530
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,845
You're as dishonest as
any common road bandit.

531
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,839
I'm not ashamed of the part I play.

532
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,578
There's not a territorial border
we cross where men aren't waiting...

533
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,654
...hoping I can take them on...

534
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,518
...waiting to call themselves Larkin men.

535
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,592
You're admitting your only importance...

536
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,889
...is collecting men who don't
care whether they live or die.

537
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,793
Who only live for the moment.

538
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:39,766
It's been a long road to
make a name men will follow.

539
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,801
You'll get no apology from me.

540
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:45,100
It won't be long before you'll
be running out of borders.

541
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:48,574
You'll come full circle against
the law that made you move on.

542
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:51,737
You tie me up pretty good, Evelyn.

543
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,783
Why fight against times changing?

544
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,418
Why not join in changing them?

545
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,351
Then I'll be like all the rest.

546
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:04,688
Today I'm one of a few. I
lead. That's important to me.

547
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:17,103
Earlier, you said I reminded you of somebody.

548
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,404
He was a wagon scout.

549
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:28,342
Killed in the same Indian raid
that crippled my grandfather.

550
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:31,010
He mean something to you?

551
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:35,018
We were good friends.

552
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,785
How long ago he die?

553
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,596
Ten years.

554
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,859
And you've buried yourself
in this town ever since.

555
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,064
I object to the word "buried. "

556
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,002
object away.

557
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,540
You're living further in the past than I am.

558
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,184
<i>- All right, toro.
- I'm mean.</i>

559
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,785
You're all right.

560
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:40,884
<i>Easy, toro. Easy, toro, toro, toro.</i>

561
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,319
oh, matador.

562
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:51,366
<i>Easy, toro. Easy, toro.</i>

563
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:54,936
<i>Easy. You ready, toro?</i>

564
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,679
Come on there, killer.

565
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:18,126
There, now. Put some of that in you.

566
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,265
Hey, give me another one of these.

567
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,096
Now, get all that glass out of there.

568
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:31,206
Well, that's your stupid trick, sticking
that dumb head of yours through that window.

569
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,535
- That could've cut me.
- Wouldn't have hurt you.

570
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,041
You're pulling my hair.

571
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,074
- Hey, Drew.
- What?

572
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,311
Your turn to ante up.

573
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:46,853
Hey, Rodriguez.

574
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:49,048
Five dollars take care of that window?

575
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,827
- I thank you.
- one thing about us boys...

576
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,986
...we always like to keep everybody happy.

577
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:56,325
- Keep them happy.
- A little old dress paid for.

578
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,262
- Paid for.
- Little old window paid for.

579
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,027
- Paid for.
- Well, pay the man...

580
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:02,603
...the $5 for breaking his window.
- There you go.

581
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:07,504
Sorry we couldn't leave it on better
terms this afternoon, sheriff...

582
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:10,942
...but that preacher, he
did... He give me a wrong rub.

583
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:16,181
It'd be my pleasure and honor to buy you
a drink and kind of let the bygones go.

584
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:21,290
Well, I just come over to ask you
fellas kind of hold it down a bit.

585
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:24,091
- The noise, I mean.
- The noise.

586
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,786
Say, sheriff, you got a
little one coming along, right?

587
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,988
- Yeah.
- Well, come on, Gomez...

588
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:30,894
...pour the man a drink.

589
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:34,298
Unless you mind the likes of us
drinking to your kid's health.

590
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:36,530
I wouldn't blame him none if he did.

591
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,936
We're bums. Bums. Just bums.

592
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,045
Well, no, I appreciate the toast, naturally.

593
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:47,240
You're all right, sheriff.
Kind of man I'd like to ride...

594
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:51,251
I'd like to ride with. Now, what do we have?

595
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:52,911
Hey, Drew.

596
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,857
- What is that?
- He got a badge with the job.

597
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:59,825
Well, naturally, a sheriff
has to have a badge.

598
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,025
It's not exactly a badge, it's...

599
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,724
Well, no, I shouldn't say that. It's...

600
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,665
That's a badge?

601
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:10,305
Well, my boys kind of hammered it out for me.

602
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,634
I ain't never seen anything like that.

603
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,175
- Mind your manners.
- Look how they spelled that.

604
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:17,313
I said, mind your manners.

605
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,146
Look how that's spelled.

606
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,283
Norman...

607
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,445
...that spells "sheriff. "

608
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:29,649
But look how it's written on there.

609
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:34,926
Well, their schooling hadn't
gone very far, time they made it.

610
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:37,662
Right smart badge, sheriff.

611
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,631
You got youngsters to be proud of.

612
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:42,428
Well, I sure am proud.

613
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,264
I am proud.

614
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:49,104
It's about their bedtime. I'd better get
over there and say good night to them.

615
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,839
Say, glad we're leaving
on good terms, sheriff.

616
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,812
I mean, I hate leaving a man I like.

617
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:56,781
You know, I mean, him not
thinking well of me and all.

618
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:02,122
Well, I'd appreciate you
fellas kind of taking it easy...

619
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,383
...so the town won't be disturbed.

620
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:06,694
We're your boys.

621
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,539
Get that hair down, Pancho.

622
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:24,637
- Everything all right, Johnny?
- It's all right, it's all right.

623
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:27,282
- They're getting mean...
- They'll be gone soon, Arthur.

624
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,884
Why don't you go to bed and get some sleep.

625
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:57,336
She sure got a way of making a man ache.

626
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:04,443
Well, we could draw straws,
see who says hello first.

627
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:07,513
Well, I never heard of anyone
getting to sleep on a windowsill.

628
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,709
We were watching Arthur, Pa.

629
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:12,354
That's not too polite, you know.

630
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:14,547
Watching a fella without him knowing it.

631
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:18,319
Franklin said Arthur took the town's
name because he forgot his own.

632
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,520
Yeah, I guess that's the way it happened.

633
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:22,961
How can anybody forget their last name?

634
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,965
Because some people just don't
have good memories, that's all.

635
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:28,160
But Firecreek's a funny name to pick.

636
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:32,369
No, you say it together...

637
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:34,271
...it sounds kind of nice.

638
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:39,279
Arthur Firecreek, Arthur
Firecreek, Arthur Firecreek.

639
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:42,678
Pa, will you finish the
story you started last night?

640
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:47,086
Will the new baby be born
when we get home tomorrow?

641
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,817
Well, that's possible. But,
anything starts to happen...

642
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,393
...Mr. Hall's out there
and he'll come let us know.

643
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,797
We're hoping it's a baby brother, not a girl.

644
00:58:56,866 --> 00:59:00,324
Well, I'd say a sister
wouldn't be all that bad.

645
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:02,471
But you can't play with girls.

646
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:04,469
That's true.

647
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:07,041
That's true, that would be a drawback.

648
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,805
Well, does anybody remember
where I was in the story?

649
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,608
I remember. The nesters
were putting up mud huts...

650
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:16,581
...and Sam Bass was hired by
the bad rancher to get them off.

651
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,846
He rode out and was gonna burn their crops.

652
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,751
They wouldn't have anything to eat...

653
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:23,757
...and they all worried about
not having anything to eat.

654
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:29,257
Well, then, this...

655
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,391
Among these nesters was this family...

656
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:38,405
...and they had two boys
about your age, and...

657
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:51,037
Meli?

658
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:22,972
Meli!

659
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:34,381
Meli!

660
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:44,990
Now, you get back to your livery, stable boy.

661
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,411
You stop hurting Meli!

662
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,947
Now, you show yourself
around here again, boy...

663
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,423
...you're gonna get more of the same.

664
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,654
You ain't going back.

665
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,835
Just a minute, boy.

666
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,596
Don't take but a hair on that trigger.

667
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,507
You're gonna stand right there...

668
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:55,026
There ain't nothing we can do for him now.

669
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:05,046
old limp-brain shot him, huh?

670
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,540
I didn't mean to.

671
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,777
I didn't mean to.

672
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,053
Johnny.

673
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:21,761
I didn't mean to do it, Johnny.

674
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:26,433
How do you not mean to
shoot a man in the back?

675
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:29,070
- And with his own gun.
- Just what happened, Arthur?

676
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,138
I ain't never shot a gun before, Johnny.

677
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:35,969
- What was going on?
- He was hurting Meli.

678
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:39,444
That's all I was trying to do,
Johnny. I was just trying to stop him.

679
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:46,281
Can you tell us what happened, Meli?

680
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,418
He forced his way into my bedroom.

681
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,686
Now, wait a minute.

682
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,487
Who's talking for Drew?

683
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,792
I mean, who's saying he wasn't invited?

684
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,264
I'll say that, mister.

685
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:01,460
I don't see what this argument's got to do...

686
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,502
...with putting a bullet in a man's back.

687
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:07,871
- I ain't never shot a gun before.
- You sure made out the first time, boy.

688
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:10,768
You go on inside, Meli.

689
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:16,380
Well, this is something
for the Sweetwater judge.

690
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:18,179
A judge?

691
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:20,854
Mister, where I come from,
this calls for a rope.

692
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,422
Now, you just hold on.

693
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:24,560
If anything, there's been an accident here.

694
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,490
That boy would never shoot anybody.

695
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,858
Then what's your decision?

696
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,899
Well, the Sweetwater judge. He can
ask questions, get the proper answers.

697
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:35,401
We can have him in here
by the first of next week.

698
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:39,063
You expecting us to wait around
here a week to testify, mister?

699
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,706
- Come on, Arthur.
- Where, Johnny?

700
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,940
You come on with me. I gotta put you in jail.

701
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:48,674
In jail? I...

702
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:51,919
Now, you come on.

703
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,921
You couldn't do some quiet
drinking and get some sleep.

704
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,584
oh, now, you gotta be fair, Bob.

705
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:03,026
Drew didn't figure on no fuss being
made over a squaw. None of us did.

706
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:07,101
Never mind that Indian squaw, we
always say we take care of our own.

707
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,534
Now, Drew's dying needs taking care of.

708
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:12,765
He was shot by a stable boy who
couldn't tell you what day it is.

709
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:14,671
He got it in the back, is what counts.

710
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:20,248
Now, we've been your men, Bob...

711
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,518
...but maybe we'll start voting
on what gets done around here.

712
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:28,717
When did you ever show enough
brains to vote on what gets done?

713
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,864
I was just trying to help her,
Johnny. If somebody's getting hurt...

714
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:39,865
...that's what you do, try to help.

715
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:44,132
I know, Arthur. I'm really putting
you in here for your own protection.

716
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:47,003
Well, why ain't they in here
instead, Johnny? Those men.

717
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:49,542
or maybe make them leave town.

718
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:53,677
Well, it just...

719
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,749
It isn't exactly a case
of right or wrong, Arthur.

720
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:02,619
You see, sometimes a fellow
just has to kind of step back...

721
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,919
...and wait a little time.

722
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,056
I don't understand, Johnny.

723
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:13,633
I don't even know whether I've
the right to put you in jail...

724
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,828
...let alone go out and arrest somebody else.

725
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,700
I don't even know why I'm in town.

726
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:20,808
This whole thing is as much my business as...

727
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,580
All right, everybody out here!

728
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:31,645
Come out and say goodbye to Drew.

729
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:35,219
Did you hear that, boys?

730
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:39,082
All right, everybody get out here!

731
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:49,496
Well, now we're gonna
have a little party, pop.

732
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,798
All right, everybody out here!

733
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:54,238
You hear? Come on out here, now.

734
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:57,846
All right, everybody's gonna get out
here and say goodbye to Drew, now.

735
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,039
Everybody out, you hear?

736
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:04,515
Come out, now. You hear
me? Everybody out here!

737
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:07,115
All right, everybody out.

738
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:11,950
Barkeep! Take the whiskey out here, pronto.

739
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:15,458
Come on, everybody, get out here!

740
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:18,799
Now, you folks just sit
down. Make yourself at home.

741
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,401
Just have a seat.

742
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,564
Everybody out, you hear?

743
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:28,475
Come on out. Everybody get out here!

744
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:36,579
Come on, now, everybody get
out here. Come out, you hear?

745
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,149
What's going on?

746
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:43,183
Just an old-fashioned wake.

747
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,224
Hey, you play this thing, pops?

748
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,328
- Wouldn't be up to it.
- I didn't think so.

749
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,657
Ten dollars to anybody can play this thing!

750
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,801
Who wants to make $ 10?
Mister! You wanna make $ 10?

751
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:56,665
All right, y'all get out here. Let's
don't find anybody hiding under a bed.

752
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:58,067
Stop your bellering.

753
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:03,410
Well, sorry, Bob. Kind of forgot myself.

754
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:06,912
All right, you folks, come
on down here and sit down.

755
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,710
Come right on down.

756
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:12,376
Guess you'd have no objection
to how we bury our own.

757
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,853
Come have a seat. We're
gonna get some service.

758
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:18,460
That's right. You just head up the
street with all those nice people.

759
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:20,561
Well, now...

760
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,527
...if it ain't old Five-Dollar Nellie.

761
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:28,730
- My name's Leah.
- That's just a joke, honey.

762
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:30,701
You wearing that pretty dress for me?

763
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:35,199
- You like it?
- Yeah, I like it, along with what's inside it.

764
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:40,205
- You go to your room and stay.
- Now, ma'am, I said everybody.

765
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:44,318
I ain't going no place but where
I want, and you can't make me.

766
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:46,318
You're to stay in the house, Leah.

767
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:49,083
Mr. Cobb, I don't mind seeing
a burial, I truly don't.

768
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:51,923
Get back in there.

769
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:58,923
Sheriff, the little gal just wanted to
pay her respects to the dead, that's all.

770
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:03,428
Miss Littlejohn, you don't
have to be out here either.

771
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:08,406
oh, it's all right, Johnny. There
should be some of us attending.

772
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:11,938
We got a lot of old people in this town...

773
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:15,550
...it'll be up to them, and not you,
whether they want to be at a wake.

774
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:17,913
Well, seems you and me come abutting heads
- on.

775
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:20,521
Now, you gotta understand, sheriff...

776
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:24,056
...we got a religious way of
doing things when we lose a man...

777
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:27,195
...and I'll appreciate you respecting that.

778
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:32,163
Come on down here. Come right on down.

779
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,801
Sit down, folks.

780
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:35,368
Come on down and have a seat.

781
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:41,508
Gotta keep the guest of honor happy, folks.

782
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:17,470
You just hoot out if you
want it louder, old buddy.

783
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,966
It's disturbing where I stand.

784
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:45,231
I got a good mind to put a stop to this.

785
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:46,635
That might cause trouble.

786
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:49,710
But me being called sheriff
and having all this go on...

787
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:51,743
Well, now, maybe...

788
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:56,317
...what's going on isn't
even any of your business.

789
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:04,319
Look, I don't think anything's
happening worth you getting hurt over.

790
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:06,993
In the morning, they'll be gone.

791
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:11,322
Everything creeping along
the way it was before.

792
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:15,534
Everybody protecting his own little world.

793
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:22,467
I don't understand what
you mean, Mr. Whittier.

794
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:26,444
What regard, Johnny?

795
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:32,547
Well, you sound like nothing
mattered, if I heard you right.

796
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:37,592
Just unimportance, Johnny. Nothing important.

797
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,921
The town, the valley.

798
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:44,662
See, I'm old enough to
have learned, Johnny...

799
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:48,569
...nothing ever stands still.

800
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:51,433
You grow or you die.

801
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,298
And a town that collects losers...

802
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:58,469
...will exist for their lifetimes, no more.

803
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,778
Losers?

804
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:03,543
Losers. Yes, Johnny.

805
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:08,217
Take Arthur, poor simpleton that he is.

806
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:12,918
Six years ago he drifted in here, not
even knowing what his last name was.

807
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:15,459
But he still had the mental capacity...

808
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,862
...to recognize a town that
he wouldn't have to compete in.

809
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:26,234
You know, I once practiced law.

810
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:30,040
Haven't you ever wondered
why I came to these parts?

811
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,615
Well, you said it was your health.

812
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:40,184
Well, peace of mind is also a man's health.

813
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:45,653
I found myself unable to cope
with making important decisions...

814
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:49,958
...so I came to Firecreek because
I could live out each day here...

815
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:53,898
...without my word having any import.

816
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:58,032
I'm no different from all the rest of them...

817
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,505
...no different at all, Johnny.

818
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:04,703
Look. Just look at them out there.

819
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:09,317
They're frightened because of
something new and strange in town.

820
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:14,422
Disturbed because today
didn't turn out like yesterday.

821
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,029
Let it go, Johnny.

822
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:24,222
Let it go.

823
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:30,937
But we've got more than
that here, Mr. Whittier.

824
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,404
We've got to have more than that.

825
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:38,578
- We...
- Johnny! Johnny. Johnny.

826
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:40,975
Johnny!

827
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:44,945
- It's bad, Johnny, real bad.
- What happened?

828
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,578
I don't know. It's just bad.
Henrietta, she's screaming.

829
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:53,895
Let me in there.

830
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:13,246
How we leaving here,
Bob? our tails tucked in?

831
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:16,407
We leave here like we
leave every other place...

832
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:18,917
...swinging high and wide.

833
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:30,892
Looks like it's gonna be a busy night.

834
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:36,371
Well, now, how's the little girl...

835
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:39,837
...I'm liable to bundle off to St.
Joe before she even thinks of it?

836
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:42,442
- Some dancing left?
- Honey, it ain't only left...

837
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:45,944
...but Drew's liable to come raring
out of that chair plain jealous.

838
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:49,174
I hope you won't be
leaving too early tomorrow.

839
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:52,019
We'll be leaving, honey, but not too early.

840
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:53,916
Got some unfinished business.

841
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:58,520
Come on, girl.

842
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:03,660
Kind of pride ourselves we
leave no business unfinished.

843
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,964
That right, Bob?

844
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,380
Get out.

845
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:31,793
- You're not sleeping.
- Naturally I'm not.

846
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:34,789
May I come in?

847
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:51,479
You're humiliating this town.

848
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,880
It's nothing I want.

849
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:57,018
I thought you placed such
great importance on leading.

850
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,816
Your so-called...

851
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,856
...town sheriff and me...

852
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:08,924
...are quite a bit alike.

853
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:10,595
How do you see that?

854
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:15,301
We're both riding a greased
pig. Nothing to hold on.

855
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:19,670
I don't know what's going through his mind...

856
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:22,376
...but in my case, I'm not expected...

857
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:25,513
...to leave behind one of my
men with a bullet in his back.

858
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:28,741
And you placate these animals you call men?

859
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:31,384
Certain things are expected of me.

860
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:33,919
Well, why not do the
unexpected? Ride on alone.

861
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,579
You don't need these killers.

862
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:40,617
Maybe I've been alone, didn't like it.

863
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:47,565
Maybe I don't have your temperament
to accept another empty day.

864
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:50,598
That's insulting.

865
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:58,145
Then you do have something left.

866
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,512
You know, Evelyn...

867
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,843
...I've known a lot of women.

868
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,453
Been with a lot.

869
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,654
Is that supposed to excite me?

870
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,490
No, no. I'm trying to explain.

871
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:14,060
I never loved any.

872
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:21,497
I kept thinking the
craziest thing out there...

873
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,795
...like I'd be coming back this way.

874
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:27,266
I don't know when.

875
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:54,768
I can't gamble with being nobody.

876
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:57,435
I've been that.

877
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:01,834
It doesn't work for me.

878
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:31,730
It's a false labor. Same
trouble as with your youngest.

879
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,543
Henrietta.

880
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,627
Johnny.

881
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:58,322
I'm glad you came.

882
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:02,801
- I should have gone over to Sweetwater.
- No.

883
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:05,405
I'm gonna be all right.

884
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:12,174
I was dreaming of our wedding day.

885
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:13,905
Remember, Johnny?

886
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,687
Held up the wagon train for a whole hour.

887
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:22,953
You were so shy.

888
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:25,025
So handsome.

889
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:31,455
Just plain everyday scared, that's...

890
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:38,868
But in my dream, we didn't
pull out of the wagon train.

891
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:43,409
We went on to oregon, the
way we'd first planned.

892
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:48,505
I saw everything so clear.

893
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:55,684
There was land up there
as far as we could see.

894
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:00,061
our land.

895
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:03,664
Land for our sons.

896
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:09,397
You remember how it was, Johnny?

897
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:11,471
The things we talked about?

898
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,403
I remember.

899
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:19,277
So adventurous, so exciting.

900
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:25,945
There was nothing we couldn't do,
nothing, the two of us together.

901
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:31,924
oh, Johnny.

902
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,758
Why didn't we go on?

903
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:45,698
Why did we settle for less than we wanted?

904
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:01,545
Johnny, hold my hand.

905
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:05,826
Don't go away.

906
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:08,121
Hold tight.

907
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:15,565
Stay with me, Johnny.

908
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,728
Dulcie.

909
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:50,831
I've got to get back to town.

910
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:54,205
Well, there's obviously
nothing holding you here.

911
01:21:56,778 --> 01:21:59,508
There are some men in town...

912
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:07,014
...and I just feel it's
better if I'd be there.

913
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:10,616
I said that there was
nothing holding you here.

914
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:13,116
I've got to get in there.

915
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:23,766
If I just felt that she'd be all right...

916
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,568
Henrietta's my whole life, Dulcie.

917
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:35,272
Now, leaving here, I'd...

918
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:39,584
If I just... If I just knew that she...

919
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:47,356
Her worst time was last
night. She'll do all right now.

920
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:13,884
Johnny?

921
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:17,753
Hold my hand.

922
01:26:24,078 --> 01:26:26,638
How could you let it happen?

923
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:39,053
How could you let it happen?

924
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:56,366
Well, you were all here.

925
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:01,874
How could you let it happen?!

926
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:06,143
They had no choice.

927
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:12,557
We didn't bother running.

928
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:25,264
No reason to run.

929
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:27,999
Where you find no law, you set your own.

930
01:27:30,478 --> 01:27:33,743
We tried him, found him guilty.

931
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:42,217
Maybe nobody can keep you from
leaving this town, but I'm following.

932
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,756
I'm following, and when
we get to a marshal...

933
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,917
...I'm gonna charge you with murder.

934
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:49,928
Wherever you go, Larkin, I'm following...

935
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,760
...and I'm gonna watch all four of you hang!

936
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:03,768
Little worrying over that
leg will slow you down.

937
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:10,081
Still owe shoeing money.

938
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:16,788
Guess $5 ought to cover it.

939
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:20,894
Ain't nothing $5 won't
take care of in this town.

940
01:28:41,249 --> 01:28:44,377
Mr. Whittier. Mr...

941
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:47,077
Mr. Whittier, you've got a
handgun here. I'll take it.

942
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:51,817
- Give it up, Johnny. It'd be a losing game.
- Come on. Come on, I want that gun.

943
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,627
It's not your fight. It's
not your business, Johnny.

944
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:58,994
And that's what I've been telling
myself ever since they rode in here.

945
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,533
Well, it was my business, Mr. Whittier.

946
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:04,570
The Larkins of this world
are everybody's business.

947
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:08,197
And they won't disappear just by
turning your head or stepping back.

948
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:11,834
That boy's dead because I didn't take
a stand with them in the beginning.

949
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:15,005
I'm not watching you get
yourself killed by those men.

950
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:16,946
You say this is a town of losers.

951
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:18,881
How could you say Arthur is a loser?

952
01:29:19,053 --> 01:29:22,079
He fought back and didn't have
anything to fight back with.

953
01:29:22,256 --> 01:29:24,554
Now... Now, me, a loser...

954
01:29:24,726 --> 01:29:27,126
...well, that's something else again.

955
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:29,495
No, I'll agree with you there.

956
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:31,256
The day I crossed this valley...

957
01:29:31,432 --> 01:29:34,663
...you had the biggest loser
of all time settling right here.

958
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:38,670
Do you know what I saw in this
place I was willing to call my home?

959
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:42,207
- I'm not giving you that gun, Johnny!
- Listen to me!

960
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,436
I had my whole life ahead of me.

961
01:29:44,612 --> 01:29:47,945
And all I saw here was
land that nobody wanted...

962
01:29:48,116 --> 01:29:50,812
...and ground that nobody
would be challenging me for.

963
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:53,044
I saw too many people die fighting over land.

964
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,553
This wasn't gonna happen
to me. Not to Johnny Cobb.

965
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:57,190
Johnny Cobb had the answer.

966
01:29:57,358 --> 01:29:59,826
Search for a place where
there are no bruises...

967
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:01,825
...and tie it up with a ribbon...

968
01:30:01,996 --> 01:30:07,957
...and tell yourself that what's
inside is the sum total of your life.

969
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:12,402
And what I didn't see was the day a
man decides not to face the world...

970
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:14,507
...is the day he better step out of it!

971
01:30:14,675 --> 01:30:16,199
Now, give me the gun!

972
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:23,706
Mangy cur.

973
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:39,829
And that Indian girl across the
street and that child of hers.

974
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:42,435
That child belonged to my dead brother.

975
01:30:43,371 --> 01:30:46,101
Got to be a habit, not taking a stand.

976
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,970
Easier all the time.

977
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:52,544
Wouldn't admit that a half-breed was a Cobb.

978
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:55,742
Bottom shelf, Johnny.

979
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:02,153
They can't exist in this world, Mr. Whittier.

980
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:06,760
once people take a stand, there won't
be any place for the Larkins to hide.

981
01:31:08,863 --> 01:31:12,799
Henrietta said we settled for a
lot less here. Well, maybe we did.

982
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:14,730
Maybe we did.

983
01:31:14,902 --> 01:31:16,597
But I'm fighting for my home.

984
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:19,801
And I'm fighting for my
boys taking over someday...

985
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:21,874
...and making the name Firecreek heard...

986
01:31:22,043 --> 01:31:25,740
...and making this valley
a place we got some pride in.

987
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:37,488
And I just don't think I'm gonna
be apologizing for wearing this.

988
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,089
That's a lesson I learned long ago.

989
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:17,129
A man worth shooting's a man worth killing.

990
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:48,527
Spread out, go in fast.

991
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:36,533
Nothing.

992
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:39,306
He's got an advantage, knowing the town.

993
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:42,813
Well, I'm kind of getting
fed up with this sodbuster.

994
01:34:00,768 --> 01:34:04,534
All right, Cobb, we'll settle for a standoff.

995
01:34:04,705 --> 01:34:06,798
We leave, you go for a marshal.

996
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:10,233
We'll take our chances on the trail.

997
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:14,414
Got that backed up with a hole card, Cobb.

998
01:34:14,582 --> 01:34:16,516
You agree, or we burn the town.

999
01:34:20,688 --> 01:34:25,284
If I had the use of my legs for
10 minutes and a gun in my hand...

1000
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:31,063
Time for him to show some sense.

1001
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,295
You cut out along the back, to the livery.

1002
01:34:35,469 --> 01:34:38,632
You don't hear from Cobb, put a match to it.

1003
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:47,111
Cobb, this whole town goes
up like a prairie fire.

1004
01:34:47,281 --> 01:34:48,771
Won't be anything left.

1005
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:52,342
Johnny should say something.

1006
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:58,357
Your time's run out, Cobb.

1007
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:11,902
Put it out.

1008
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:15,539
Put that match out.

1009
01:35:19,847 --> 01:35:21,974
Why not give a little,
take a little, sheriff?

1010
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:25,180
Now unbuckle your gun belt.

1011
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:27,820
I mean, you step back, we'll do the same.

1012
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:29,546
Unbuckle it.

1013
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:33,357
What's the matter, sheriff? You nervous?

1014
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:35,620
That's right, I'm nervous.

1015
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:40,132
All right.

1016
01:35:41,102 --> 01:35:44,094
Sure can't agree with your thinking about...

1017
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:27,707
You know better than to go
to a man who's expecting you.

1018
01:36:31,685 --> 01:36:35,815
Bob. Bob.

1019
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,258
Bob. Bob.

1020
01:36:57,678 --> 01:36:58,975
We'll start moving around...

1021
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:02,673
...once he takes to worrying about
where we are, what we might be doing.

1022
01:37:03,117 --> 01:37:04,812
We'll wait.

1023
01:37:05,186 --> 01:37:06,414
I ain't gonna wait, Bob.

1024
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:09,488
I think he's around that livery,
and that's all I need to know.

1025
01:39:14,214 --> 01:39:15,806
- Pa!
- Pa!

1026
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:04,096
Larkin!

1027
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:40,390
Cobb!

1028
01:40:50,177 --> 01:40:52,145
Drop it, Cobb, it's all over.

1029
01:41:07,961 --> 01:41:09,189
I said, it's all over.

1030
01:41:09,363 --> 01:41:11,524
Drop it and you'll live. I'll ride out.

1031
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:18,034
What are you proving?

1032
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:33,250
Two dollars a month, a homemade badge.

1033
01:41:33,654 --> 01:41:36,054
You've got no business
laying your life on the line.

1034
01:43:01,975 --> 01:43:03,499
Johnny.

1035
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:06,707
Johnny.

1036
01:43:10,784 --> 01:43:12,513
Pa!

1037
01:43:14,121 --> 01:43:15,110
Pa!

1038
01:44:02,302 --> 01:44:04,293
