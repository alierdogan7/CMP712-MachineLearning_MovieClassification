1
00:01:33,195 --> 00:01:36,224
Ooh!  Jesus Christ!

2
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:38,274
What's wrong?

3
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:41,462
What's wrong? It fuckin' hurts, Doc.

4
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:42,482
What do you think's wrong?

5
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:49,239
As the particular mix of stupidity and self-pity that moved you is of no interest to me,

6
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:53,359
I will not put to you the question of why you would abrade a healing wound.

7
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:57,609
I was examining myself for fuckin' pus.

8
00:01:57,954 --> 00:02:06,534
Bullshit. I have a patient whose shattered foot is going gangrenous.

9
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,454
I'll likely amputate.  He's a salesman.

10
00:02:11,984 --> 00:02:16,295
His livelihood depends on walking.

11
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:25,942
I'll return tomorrow. If I see any further evidence of self-mutilation, that will be the last day I treat you.

12
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:41,786
One wonders, Sir, if last evening installed in your hostel a woman of exotic appearance,

13
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:45,328
not perhaps gypsy by extraction.

14
00:02:46,138 --> 00:02:49,451
What would your business with her be if she had?

15
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,684
To hear my fortune told.

16
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,607
There'll be none of that on these premises.

17
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:58,120
Nor were those my true intentions. Your query is impertinent.

18
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:01,011
Is the lady here?

19
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,199
2-C.

20
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:10,532
As your faith must proscribe receiving bribes, credit the five toward her stay.

21
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:17,783
Thanks so much, Aunt Lou.

22
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:18,451
All right.

23
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:23,387
You know I'll notify you first word from the freight office about your boys remains.

24
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:24,920
All right.

25
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:32,104
There's a stout woman, the Countess Berman, fires and hires for the troupe.

26
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:36,544
You will meet her at the theater should you appear and apply.

27
00:03:37,197 --> 00:03:40,625
The devout Shaunnesey has a week in advance to your account.

28
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:44,541
Take it back from him. I won't take money from you.

29
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:49,514
Are you not being quite absurd, in the self-serving way of your sex?

30
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:52,764
You come here penniless, a supplicant.

31
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:53,665
For learning.

32
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:57,902
Well well well…and to learn, must you not live?

33
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:01,292
And how will you do so amidst the thoroughfare's depravities?

34
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:05,888
Let me stay in the theater.

35
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:13,762
At a minimum, for the career to which you aspire
you show the requisite presumption.

36
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:29,667
No small part, the hotel's amelioration under your regime.  The nigger cook, no small part.

37
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:31,352
I heard you.

38
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:43,062
Hmm, a tenant when last I was resident in the previous regime.

39
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:55,402
I thought the evening went well.

40
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:56,977
Wonderful.

41
00:04:57,186 --> 00:04:59,821
Very much to our purposes—the idea of us in the camp.

42
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:08,155
And what about that beautiful harem dance by that darling little dark-haired prostitute?

43
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:13,912
My God.

44
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,321
Make yourself fuckin' small, Mrs. Ellsworth!

45
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:28,039
My goodness. I believe someone's shooting at the former tenant.

46
00:05:33,946 --> 00:05:35,092
Keep your fuckin' head down!

47
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:36,821
Get to the fuckin' schoolhouse!

48
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:40,505
Particular attention to the foundling and send fuckin' Trixie over here!

49
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:44,695
Oh, just some nonsense among the ordinaries, Sir.

50
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:46,468
Getting Mrs. Ellsworth under cover.

51
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:50,227
Excess of fuckin' caution, but you yourself, Sir, are absolutely safe!

52
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,401
Absolutely safe, Sir.

53
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:58,588
Wire Bullock in Sturgis. “Return's urgently required.”

54
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,348
In fuckin' generalities only, otherwise that maniac'll come back shooting.

55
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:06,880
No, not that way.  Don't want that cocksucker knowing nothing of our business.

56
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,944
Upstairs and fuckin' around you'll find the fuckin' telegraph.  Johnny.

57
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:12,684
Oughtn't someone look out for who fired?

58
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:15,457
Richardson, look into who fired.

59
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:18,222
What was it?

60
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:19,180
The business of others.

61
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:23,475
Shall we review the biddin' in my fuckin' office?

62
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:24,621
Oh, I need to take off my corset.

63
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:26,662
And no one objects to that here.

64
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:04,711
Easily as it could have been some hooplehead,
not knowing who or what he was shooting at,

65
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,943
it's likely prudent to credit you as the target.

66
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:09,879
Yes.

67
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,892
If I'd been aimed at, of course…

68
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:17,035
dozens of authors would need be considered.

69
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:17,660
Yes.

70
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:25,782
So I know someone's in there, vary your replies, such as, “Yes…and I'd be one of them.”

71
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:29,381
That wouldn't be very grateful of me.

72
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:37,191
It's horrible being shot at.  Never gets no better.

73
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:38,431
Yeah.

74
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,211
What the fuck?

75
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:46,635
Assuming she ain't got the smell of gunpowder on her fingers, I'm leaving you to her.

76
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:51,020
Thank you, Mr. Swearengen.

77
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:58,417
Who the fuck shot at her?

78
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,176
Who the fuck knows?  Hearst?  Her first husband's family?

79
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:03,206
They both work with the fuckin' Pinkertons.

80
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:04,567
Maybe they're now allied.

81
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:07,425
Someone should see to the child as her fuckin' heir.

82
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:11,175
Bein' looked to.  Just you fuckin' look after that one till matters clarify.

83
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:14,458
Don't think of tossing the place.  Every fuckin' valuable's inventoried.

84
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:15,697
Get Tom Nuttall!

85
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:19,355
Cheyenne's off.  God damn it!  Second-rate deployment, Dan.

86
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,208
Sending you off for reinforcements to come back to a camp in ruins.

87
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,518
I'll pack, unpack, repack.

88
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:26,830
Whoever you intended to fuck, send monies to bring her here.

89
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:29,269
Who I intended to fuck won't ride a stagecoach.

90
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:30,145
Makes her puke.

91
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:35,822
Toast and eggs or toast and bacon—she can choose or she can mix ‘em, whatever she wants.

92
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,563
Why the fuck are you telling me?

93
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:47,387
Every step a fuckin' adventure.

94
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:50,853
Collect fuckin' Ellsworth. Nothing of her being shot at.

95
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:53,416
What am I to say I'm collecting him for?

96
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:54,826
Just knock him out and bring him im.

97
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,823
Do you want to close?

98
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,043
No, I don't wanna close.

99
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:07,072
Fuckin' Hearst's to see not one single sign on any fuckin' front that he's had half a cunt hair's effect on any of the comings and goings in this camp.

100
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,684
Telegram's sent to the Sheriff.

101
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:12,239
Blazanov's helping Merrick dress.

102
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:15,090
Why the fuck would you say that to me?

103
00:09:15,364 --> 00:09:20,934
Merrick—that was beat up yesterday—is being helped to dress by Blazanov.

104
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:27,124
Now Blazanov sent the telegram to the Sheriff,
so's Merrick could come do his part.

105
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:28,634
All right.

106
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:30,962
Should I relieve Adams at the schoolhouse?

107
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:31,734
Please.

108
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:39,793
Let Adams come back here, be available for whatever nefarious fuckin' carryings-on you assign him,

109
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,129
‘cause I do not take orders from you.

110
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:57,638
Before she eats,
she somersaults and don't want no one to see.

111
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,792
In fact, I rarely eat before noon.

112
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:03,610
Well, maybe you just ain't found what you like to eat yet.

113
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,344
Get out, Jewel.

114
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:15,232
Did you ever have bacon?

115
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:17,448
I very well might.

116
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:18,129
Goodbye, Jewel.

117
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:18,762
Thank you!

118
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,621
That was so considerate of her.

119
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:26,228
Fascinated by you.

120
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:44,135
If you saw who it was and want to say,
I wouldn't have to tell Al.

121
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:45,282
I didn't see.

122
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:50,230
And I'm very grateful to be under Mr. Swearengen's protection.

123
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:52,542
Yeah, he's a prince.

124
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:55,195
In the Sheriff's absence, I mean.

125
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,307
Good a place as any for you to be

126
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:02,279
…in the Sheriff's absence.

127
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:26,204
She somersaulted and et and says her entire fuckin' dietary outlook has changed.

128
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,735
What plate did she et from?

129
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:30,505
She et from them fuckin' both.

130
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:38,521
What a world.  A woman in innocent transit.

131
00:11:40,147 --> 00:11:48,663
A wayward shot from some watering hole, do you suppose, prompted by a surfeit or spirits, exuberant punctuations of some sort?

132
00:11:48,953 --> 00:11:50,626
Do you believe anything you say?

133
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,017
I am hypothesizing.

134
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:56,392
And have you some private hypothesis as to my possible role?

135
00:11:56,603 --> 00:11:57,976
In the shooting at Mrs. Ellsworth?

136
00:11:57,976 --> 00:11:59,487
In the rising of the sun.

137
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:07,702
I would hypothesize as to the latter possibility, Sir, before imagining you involved with the first.

138
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:10,913
Oh come, Jarry.
My holdings butt up against hers.

139
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:14,987
I value efficiencies and economies of consolidation.

140
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:17,983
Haven't I reason to nudge her toward a sale?

141
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:31,348
Men of a certain caliber cannot allow fastidious morality to distract them from the exigencies of commerce,

142
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:32,295
can they, Mr. Hearst?

143
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:39,950
And did you heave up your responsibilities upon broad and reconciled shoulders?

144
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,579
No.

145
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:51,285
Perhaps then, rather, at this moment you are Socrates to my Alcibiades, taken it upon yourself to edify me.

146
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,466
Are you saying you want to fuck me?

147
00:12:57,122 --> 00:12:57,640
What?

148
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:00,670
Well, you keep calling yourself Alcibiades to my Socrates.

149
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,410
Are you proposing some sort of homosexual connection between us?

150
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,954
I forgot that part of the story.

151
00:13:09,158 --> 00:13:09,606
Wait.

152
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:15,785
But, if I were courting you, Mr. Hearst,

153
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:25,442
I claim no allure of my own, suggesting only the mutuality of our interests concerning the upcoming elections grants my suit some small virtue.

154
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:34,247
As you gaze upon me, Sir,recall that some unions of convenience may outlast those conceived in passion.

155
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,380
Get up off your knees.

156
00:13:36,553 --> 00:13:37,473
Of course.

157
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:44,458
Elections cannot inconvenience me. They ratify my will or I neuter them.

158
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:46,567
Compelling perspective.

159
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:47,910
Time to go back to Yankton.

160
00:13:47,971 --> 00:13:49,066
For me? 
Yes.

161
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:53,770
Locked.

162
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:05,964
The troops in Sturgis will await your instructions.

163
00:14:05,964 --> 00:14:06,974
Thank you very much.

164
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,038
“I like winter when snow and ice cover the ground.”

165
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:38,850
“I like winter when snow and ice cover…

166
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:58,350
What are you doing here?

167
00:14:58,941 --> 00:14:59,817
Too afraid.

168
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:01,868
If you were too afraid, you wouldn't be here.

169
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:04,129
Too afraid to explain.

170
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:06,710
He's got a note pinned to him, Al.

171
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:10,511
Take it off him.
Then stick him in the eye with the fucking pin.

172
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:12,645
He don't mean it.

173
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,429
Tell him, “Nothing.”

174
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:21,589
I'll just keep quiet.

175
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:28,965
No. Tell E.B, “Nothing's going on, “ and then tell him “If I wanted to tell you anything, I'd have told you.

176
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:31,238
Don't send the imbecile over with no more notes.”

177
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:33,142
I can't remember all that.

178
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:34,974
Can you remember, “Nothing's going on”?

179
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:37,303
Yes. 
Tell him that then.

180
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,160
Thank you.

181
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:50,156
The Mrs. Ellsworth was shot at?

182
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:57,094
Got her upstairs. I figured...we'd hunker down till matters clarify.

183
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:58,440
Lovely.

184
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,627
What did the geek say walking past you?

185
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,867
“The girls in here are pretty.”

186
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,390
The fool husband ought soon appear.

187
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:12,844
Some small number to deal with his dudgeon, main force in reserve for Bullock.

188
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:16,989
Okay.

189
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:35,547
How did sentiment incline in this joint when Bullock and Harry spoke last?

190
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:36,656
Glad when they was finished.

191
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:38,155
As to who had the upper hand?

192
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:43,032
Fuckin' cross-legged pose your man struck, Tom, may have swayed the diarrhea faction.

193
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:44,999
Creek was having its way with Harry.

194
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:49,583
The fuck was the logic when he sent that giant Captain to fight you?

195
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:50,835
Get me killed.

196
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,594
It wasn't to get you killed.

197
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:56,123
His man finally kills you after a more or less equal fight?

198
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:57,782
I gotta go reassure my Jew.

199
00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:00,280
Out of boredom's why he put that fight together.

200
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:05,814
Same with this too.
Fucking shots at her fore and aft.

201
00:17:06,217 --> 00:17:09,813
Wants to see he's made people afraid, so he knows he's a fucking big shot.

202
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:12,145
Exactly fucking correct, Tom.

203
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:19,012
If this was overture to an onslaught, He's have let them pistoleros loose by now to start the actual killing.

204
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:21,045
That's the keenest of fucking assessments.

205
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:23,465
Mightn't that argue for my trip to Cheyenne?

206
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:26,122
He ain't waiting no fucking week, Dan.

207
00:17:26,363 --> 00:17:29,333
I leave here full of confidence knowing you're all thinking in concert.

208
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,988
But I'd as soon not die fighting 25 against four

209
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:37,497
—you being my missing fifth, the equal of 10 of Hearst's fucking mercenaries,

210
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:44,252
and Bullock, Who's no fucking slouch either, if he ever gets the fuck back, bringing the odds closer to even.

211
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:49,000
Well, her Jew's got sand if you tell him
where to point the gun.

212
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:53,029
I'd trust a fucking wire to Cheyenne if I knew someone to send it to.

213
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:57,111
Far as that, there's Hawkeye.

214
00:17:58,673 --> 00:18:00,497
You were told never to say his name.

215
00:18:00,878 --> 00:18:03,642
Well, now I did.
And I'd trust him to hire the guns.

216
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,092
And the hiring to take place where?

217
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:08,811
Up that squaw's cunt he's fucking?

218
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:10,549
Squaw's in Lead, not Cheyenne.

219
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:12,934
Did he take vows of abstinence in Cheyenne?

220
00:18:13,186 --> 00:18:15,372
Do they let him have wires in his monastery?

221
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:19,652
I'd trust Hawkeye—once he learned the situation—to hire the guns without stealing,

222
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:23,715
to herd ‘em back here to help us out, not stopping to get laid in Lead.

223
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:25,092
Can Hawkeye read?

224
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,922
He can, and I can put my words such in the wire,

225
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:31,369
he'll take my meaning and prying cocksuckers won't.

226
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,126
Go get the fucking Russian, send the fucking wire.

227
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:35,685
Out the front or by the stairs?

228
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,464
By the stairs, by the fucking stairs.

229
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:45,182
We want his piss pot's play hours occupied by confusion and grievance.

230
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:49,735
We want him sitting,
sulking like a three-year-old whose toys won't do his biddin'.

231
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,618
I had a fucking Jack-in-th-box.

232
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,743
I'd turn and turn and turn that fucking handle, and the Jack, he'd never jump.

233
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,059
If she'd complete her walk to the bank…

234
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:08,527
she'd confound this motherless cunt.

235
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:11,180
Tea for two, Jewel, on a fucking tray!

236
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,330
When did you start giving that cocksucker Swearengen a “by your leave” and “if you fucking say so”?

237
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:18,627
Jane.

238
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:25,598
All's I asked, Jane, did he know you was relieving me?

239
00:19:26,047 --> 00:19:28,536
Maybe Swearengen's coordinating strategy

240
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:31,828
‘cause the Sheriff being gone campaigning his Deputy didn't jump to take charge.

241
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,997
We just thought we could release you to other responsibilities, Mr. Utter.

242
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:38,128
And I could run get you if they headed up.

243
00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:39,464
Assuming the unlikely need.

244
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:43,809
All right.

245
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:57,745
That's how you have to fuckin' deal with him.

246
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:04,143
Cocksucker.

247
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:08,746
How you doing, Ellsworth?

248
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,638
What the fuck did you hit me for?

249
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:15,703
You realize that was me?

250
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:18,572
You think I'm asking out of general suspicion?

251
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:26,027
All right, I'll, uh—I'll tell you what happened, fill you in on the full fucking circumstance.

252
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:33,144
Now, uh… Mrs. Ellsworth is completely safe.

253
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:36,903
Calm down or I will hit you over the fucking head again,

254
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:39,152
Maybe use some more of them spirits under your Goddamn nose.

255
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:39,994
What happened?

256
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:50,526
Well…there was some completely-no-fucking-damage-done gunfire taken at Mrs. Ellsworth fore and aft.

257
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:51,799
But she—she couldn't be no better.

258
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,495
I'll kill that cocksucker.

259
00:20:53,495 --> 00:20:55,682
You get out of my way or I'll kill you fucking first.

260
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:59,060
Put up a struggle, Ellsworth—it's stupid Goddamn thinking.

261
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:03,776
Why would they take shots at Mrs. Ellsworth fore and aft when they could have just blowed her fucking head off?

262
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,024
Goddamn it!

263
00:21:05,024 --> 00:21:07,014
Calm down and think about it!

264
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:12,182
They took shots at her fore and aft so that you would come running,

265
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:14,868
so they could do to you what they could have done to her but they didn't.

266
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:17,398
And to Bullock too, maybe.

267
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:22,848
So do you see how Goddamn irresponsible it would have been of me to allow you full fucking conscious movement?

268
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:24,817
Do you see? Now…

269
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:35,299
I'm gonna cut loose them throttles,
but you best not make me regret it.

270
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:40,613
Them shots were meant for maybe rethinking your tenure here, huh?

271
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:47,018
Maybe too, in the aftermath, the shots' author'd designed Mr. Ellsworth would be moved to take steps,

272
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:50,846
or Sheriff Bullock would, that'd justify a violent answer.

273
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:53,876
The author being Mr. Hearst.

274
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:58,049
Him, or him having made cause with your first husband's family,

275
00:21:58,394 --> 00:22:00,735
Pinkertons presiding over the vows.

276
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,174
We've wired Bullock to counsel restraint.

277
00:22:04,162 --> 00:22:06,882
We've Ellsworth trussed up downstairs.

278
00:22:07,163 --> 00:22:09,858
Little in the past commends me to your trust.

279
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:16,966
I'd ask you, accepting the premise that you were bait, not quarry—complete your walk to the bank.

280
00:22:19,469 --> 00:22:24,059
Get that fucking angler fulminating, tangling his fucking tackle and the fucking like.

281
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:24,966
Mr. Swearengen.

282
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:26,060
I'm sorry.

283
00:23:03,788 --> 00:23:04,851
I'm quite all right.

284
00:23:06,434 --> 00:23:08,162
I thank God for it.

285
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:11,819
And I'd be glad to keep you company the rest of your day.

286
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:16,134
I'd be glad if you'd join me at the bank in a few minutes' time,

287
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,535
having made my way to the bank alone.

288
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,989
Why in heaven's name would you want to do that?

289
00:23:23,348 --> 00:23:30,350
To demonstrate his tactics failure and to bid defiance to him who shot at me.

290
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,098
I got an idea who had you shot at.

291
00:23:33,522 --> 00:23:35,288
Wouldn't mind killing him, even if I'm wrong.

292
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:38,573
If the shots meant not to harm me but to provoke certain others,

293
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:42,600
wouldn't attempting that be playing into our adversary's strategy?

294
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,373
If it ends with one between Hearst's eyes,

295
00:23:44,592 --> 00:23:46,474
let me play to his strategy and welcome.

296
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:52,910
I hope instead you'd have dinner tonight with Sofia and me,

297
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:56,974
all of us having passed the interval uneventfully.

298
00:24:00,254 --> 00:24:05,864
In any case, please accede to my walking to the bank alone.

299
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:37,681
I'd not have you step one more foot forward, Ellsworth.

300
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:40,157
As I fucking understand.

301
00:25:56,593 --> 00:25:58,311
For Mr. Swearengen.

302
00:25:59,471 --> 00:26:03,128
Last man took a note for you to Swearengen wound up dead.

303
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:08,051
The man you refer to knew the note he bore might bring about that outcome.

304
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,422
This note's import's more innocuous.

305
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,279
Will it make you less afraid to read it?

306
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,889
I ain't afraid.  I guess I made a poor joke.

307
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:16,377
You do read.

308
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:17,456
Sure, sure I do.

309
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:19,175
Read the note then.

310
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:26,513
It's good.

311
00:26:26,966 --> 00:26:28,483
Out loud, so I know you can.

312
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,831
I made a poor joke—

313
00:26:29,831 --> 00:26:35,279
Out loud, to prove you are lettered and not a liar unfit for my employ!

314
00:26:40,028 --> 00:26:45,107
“Thanks from all for your rescue of Mrs. Ellsworth.

315
00:26:45,107 --> 00:26:46,313
Who could have shot at her?

316
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:52,092
Do you wish her guarded at the bank with the Sheriff away?

317
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:57,687
I saw you let her walk alone. Answer via bearer.”

318
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,453
You don't read easily, do you?

319
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:15,218
Why don't you come to my office while I compose my reply?

320
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:30,687
I'd have asked Jewel ask her, if I thought to ask, if I'd foreseen in time.

321
00:27:31,473 --> 00:27:32,983
You'd have only put Jewel in a position—

322
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:36,751
She talks to Trixie, the bank woman. Why wouldn't she talk to us?

323
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:41,548
‘Cause she has something to say to Trixie. We'd just be asking conversation that she wouldn't know where to begin with.

324
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:44,901
Philadelphia's where she's from. ‘S what we could've had as a subject.

325
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:46,992
Got beautiful gracious manners there.

326
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:49,904
Philadelphia, its many gracious attractions.

327
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,982
Her dress, her comportment.

328
00:27:52,614 --> 00:27:54,904
She'd have fucking talked to us.

329
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,779
May we speak?

330
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:03,373
You stand in the hallway addressing me in my room.

331
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,498
Yes.

332
00:28:18,152 --> 00:28:23,581
The girl who danced last evening, vagabond sort, hodgepodge costume—

333
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:24,434
I know who you mean.

334
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:28,152
She'll be staying in the theater, possibly joining the troupe.

335
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:37,088
Knowing precious little at all events, of the course now charting I know absolutely nothing at all.

336
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,780
You seem to know what it means for us.

337
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:44,622
Knowing you, I suppose I do, swearing I've laid no carnal hand to her.

338
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:47,106
What does installing her accomplish acknowledging me could not?

339
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:50,027
Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.

340
00:28:50,932 --> 00:28:55,121
That I'm old, that I've lost my belly for sham.

341
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:03,902
Every drawing I made in this sketchbook, every one I've dreamed of painting from,

342
00:29:04,151 --> 00:29:05,894
near a home where we'd live.

343
00:29:06,229 --> 00:29:09,965
Say at least I never asked it of you.

344
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:14,390
You'd have me say that on the day you ask it of someone else?

345
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,494
Shall I have these?

346
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,112
No.

347
00:29:21,612 --> 00:29:26,479
Paint every fucking one, Mary.

348
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:39,932
How well do you know the other guy?

349
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:41,275
Who would that be?

350
00:29:41,538 --> 00:29:43,461
That my man Dority killed—the Captain.

351
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,024
We served in the 69th in New York.

352
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,842
Was that a mick regiment?

353
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:51,712
What were you doing?

354
00:29:52,028 --> 00:29:53,308
Cutting throats.

355
00:29:54,007 --> 00:29:56,388
I was asking whose flag you were under.

356
00:29:56,786 --> 00:29:59,513
The famous cocksuckers brigade.

357
00:29:59,903 --> 00:30:00,724
Is that so?

358
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:03,251
Command of the all-whore detachment.

359
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:10,658
Distress you when my man downed your friend?

360
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:13,472
Let me tell you something, Mr. Swearengen:

361
00:30:13,717 --> 00:30:18,265
You don't scare me, and you don't fucking know what happened with the 69th New York.

362
00:30:19,545 --> 00:30:24,315
I will tell you this: I didn't like what happened to Joe Turner.

363
00:30:25,216 --> 00:30:27,557
Mr. Hearst came to him and said,

364
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:32,234
“Make it last, even if you gain the upper hand and can kill him.”

365
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:38,076
And I think that was halfway selfish of Mr. Hearst, whereas Joe could have killed your man and didn't,

366
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:39,781
and look how it wound up.

367
00:30:40,011 --> 00:30:43,778
But that's as much as I feel like saying, and that's neither here nor fucking there.

368
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:53,156
Fair enough.

369
00:30:56,717 --> 00:30:58,536
All right then.

370
00:30:58,887 --> 00:31:01,313
All right. But I'll tell you this:

371
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:05,746
You don't seem halfway like such a halfway bad fucking person.

372
00:31:10,322 --> 00:31:12,573
So should I tell Mr. Hearst that there's no messa—

373
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:18,280
So you'd shoot at a fucking woman?

374
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,157
Beat that poor newspaper bastard?

375
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:24,200
Scare that Chinese with your fucking horses?

376
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:29,041
How many ribs you think you broke?

377
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:32,563
Aw, I feel like I broke two or three ribs.

378
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:36,354
I'm talking about that newspaperman's ribs, you fucking cunt.

379
00:31:50,704 --> 00:31:57,258
I prayed it would pass! But it's a constant fucking sore spot and throb.

380
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:10,764
Uh…”you are a constant vision before me, you and your fabulous bosoms.

381
00:32:11,003 --> 00:32:18,578
I beg you, release your man stallion from his he-stable for another gallop round the ring.”

382
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,297
Not today, Con.

383
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:22,661
Tomorrow?

384
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:24,999
Come back tomorrow.

385
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,201
Any particular time?

386
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:27,608
Late in the day.

387
00:32:27,608 --> 00:32:30,045
Perfect!  We'll be waiting.

388
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,612
Listen to me, listen to me.

389
00:32:33,014 --> 00:32:35,857
And I'll tell you one fucking thing. Do you hear me?

390
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:37,609
I don't hear nothing.

391
00:32:38,002 --> 00:32:40,488
I'm telling you that I'm gonna tell you one fucking thing.

392
00:32:40,783 --> 00:32:41,594
All right.

393
00:32:41,825 --> 00:32:42,925
Do you hear me?

394
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,265
What the fuck?  I'm not fucking deaf.

395
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,435
I want…

396
00:32:46,949 --> 00:32:49,577
I want to know that I'm gonna be fucking heard,

397
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:56,262
that what I have to fucking say will matter, will have some result.

398
00:32:57,689 --> 00:33:03,422
‘Cause if not…then what's the fucking point?

399
00:33:05,388 --> 00:33:10,077
All right…then I'm not gonna say fucking anything.

400
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:11,286
What do you think of that?

401
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:18,386
He sent for more guns.

402
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:20,764
He wired for more Pinkertons.

403
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,263
They're on the way, and I told you that.

404
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:28,557
If he finds out I told you—

405
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:29,965
Don't worry.

406
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:31,763
You won't tell him?

407
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,886
You might want to close the fucking door.

408
00:33:46,948 --> 00:33:48,072
Who the fuck are you?

409
00:33:48,431 --> 00:33:50,887
Janine, that's Sara's friend from Cincinnati.

410
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:57,262
Hmm.  That's a stupid name for a whore.

411
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:59,994
Makes the tricks feel like they're stammerers.

412
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:02,843
Ja-ni-ni-nine-nine-nine, like they're in the fucking alps.

413
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:05,588
You can call me whatever you want.

414
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:09,719
Well, let's call you stupid until we can think of something better.

415
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:17,063
You miss Cincinnati, Janine-nine-nine-nine-nine?

416
00:34:17,354 --> 00:34:19,612
Are you afraid of fucking Deadwood?

417
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:24,167
Do you miss your Mom and Dad?
Do you have one of each?

418
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:27,377
Are they above ground, do you know?

419
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:34,743
Ohh…Do I see the beginnings of a tear in the corner of your left eye?

420
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:36,352
I'm all right.

421
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:38,319
For the purposes of our discussion.

422
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:42,384
As much as anyone cares, is my meaning.

423
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,367
All right, stupid.

424
00:34:47,717 --> 00:34:50,698
Con'll advance you $5 against your first evening's fucking.

425
00:34:51,054 --> 00:34:55,350
Don't do no dope with Leon.
Welcome to the Bella Union.

426
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:11,508
Close the fucking door, stupid!

427
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:16,920
He's got 25 more guns coming, 25 Pinkertons.

428
00:35:17,874 --> 00:35:19,881
When they get here, he's gonna move on the camp.

429
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:21,818
Before the elections?

430
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:25,090
25 Pinkertons already.

431
00:35:25,446 --> 00:35:29,101
He had 25 on the way, and 100 at his operation.

432
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:32,758
Before or after the elections?

433
00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:34,818
I don't know.  I don't know.

434
00:35:35,192 --> 00:35:40,130
Please don't hurt me.
It's all I fucking know.

435
00:35:46,005 --> 00:35:49,603
Come on, come on. Don't give up hope.

436
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,671
Passing a little wind.

437
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:32,664
Yes.

438
00:36:35,171 --> 00:36:36,776
Yes, come in.

439
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:46,243
Have you enjoyed yourself today, Farnum?

440
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:50,139
For reasons I find elusive, the day has quite displeased me.

441
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,328
What will help you find a name for your feelings?

442
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:56,009
Shall we cut open your belly for you to wrap your guts around a pole?

443
00:36:56,243 --> 00:36:56,992
You seem distraught.

444
00:36:57,244 --> 00:37:00,639
I am not!  I await an outcome!

445
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:03,396
And the readying for it wearies me.

446
00:37:03,396 --> 00:37:04,079
Oh, Dear.

447
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,546
Have you smelt human flesh on the spit?

448
00:37:06,772 --> 00:37:07,555
How would I have?

449
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:09,116
I know the smell.

450
00:37:09,116 --> 00:37:10,774
You have been to and fro in the world.

451
00:37:10,977 --> 00:37:13,400
It pleased me to find out.

452
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,305
Well then, fine.

453
00:37:19,293 --> 00:37:21,054
Don't you want to wipe that off?

454
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:22,883
No?

455
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:32,574
You would regret my coming back and finding that you had cleaned your face.

456
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,514
I understand.

457
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,104
Dan, Johnny.

458
00:37:59,497 --> 00:38:01,324
He doesn't want you to dirty your hands.

459
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,794
All that shouting —“You're a cunt for hire to shoot at women” and the like—

460
00:38:09,478 --> 00:38:13,407
just trying to frighten you a little, encouraging you to chat.

461
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,418
Who amongst us hasn't wanted to shoot at women once or twice, hmm?

462
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:25,915
Anything you want to say else before I let you rest, knowing I don't sit upon you in judgement?

463
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:50,179
Did he come to you by a different path, Mr. Hearst?

464
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,976
Did he somehow circumnavigate to bring my reply to you without me seeing?

465
00:38:56,195 --> 00:38:57,212
What are you talking about?

466
00:38:57,212 --> 00:39:00,603
Your man went out the back of my fucking place,

467
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:03,591
and I've been hoping against hope for reasons beyond my understanding

468
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,854
that it was to return to you unseen by me.

469
00:39:06,854 --> 00:39:08,195
He has not returned.

470
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:14,166
Jesus Christ, maybe he was telling the truth— that he was lighting out for fucking Bismarck.

471
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:16,853
Jesus Christ Almighty!

472
00:39:17,303 --> 00:39:20,320
Did you and he have some kind of misunderstanding, Sir,

473
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,623
that he took for pretext the letter's delivery to make his fucking escape?

474
00:39:24,835 --> 00:39:29,809
Well, then I say, Mr. Hearst, you are well the fuck rid of that cocksucker,

475
00:39:30,212 --> 00:39:35,729
that he'd show so little loyalty or sense of responsibility to the delivery of communications.

476
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:39,182
Jesus Christ Almighty, were do we find good help?

477
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:41,372
Oh, and in reply to your letter, Sir,

478
00:39:41,663 --> 00:39:44,700
my opinion only, she don't need no escort or guarding,

479
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,446
but it's the kind of generous inquiry I'd expect you to make.

480
00:39:48,664 --> 00:39:49,975
How's your back, Mr. Hearst?

481
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:53,381
How's the fucking back there, Pal?

482
00:39:58,059 --> 00:39:58,622
Wu.

483
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,433
Longest a rug's lasted so far.

484
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:11,115
What's going on, Charlie?

485
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,505
Some fucking day.

486
00:40:17,372 --> 00:40:18,473
It was a good day.

487
00:40:18,914 --> 00:40:22,834
I only wish some of Hearst's pistoleros had come to test our mettle.

488
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,928
Well, once my derringer was empty, you would have been firing for the both of us.

489
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:29,102
And equal to the taks, believe you fucking me.

490
00:40:30,444 --> 00:40:34,866
Not that I wouldn't have regretted them children having to witness.

491
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,287
Can I tell you something?

492
00:40:41,456 --> 00:40:42,535
Okay.

493
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:46,771
Some stupid fucking thing.
Stupid fucking dream I had.

494
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,903
Okay.

495
00:40:49,131 --> 00:40:55,212
I dreamed last night I was clamoring up a fucking creek bank,

496
00:40:55,212 --> 00:40:57,456
which is often required of a drunk.

497
00:40:58,193 --> 00:41:00,550
It was dark, and I couldn't tell where I was

498
00:41:00,755 --> 00:41:06,488
till I cleared the bank and came face to face with Charlie Utter's ugly mug.

499
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:10,566
Now Charlie's, as usual, on the lookout for Bill that's,

500
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,536
as usual too, losing at poker inside the joint we're outside of.

501
00:41:15,868 --> 00:41:17,208
“Where are we, Charlie?”

502
00:41:17,535 --> 00:41:19,817
And this could be any fucking place the last number of years.

503
00:41:20,034 --> 00:41:20,819
And he said,

504
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:26,771
“Jane, don't you know this is the Number Ten Saloon here in the camp where Bill's

505
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,314
gonna fucking get killed soon?”

506
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:32,160
“Jesus Chri—how do you know, Charlie?”

507
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:36,049
I asked him.  He said, “Don't you know,” he says,

508
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:38,863
“Some point we know these fucking things?

509
00:41:39,098 --> 00:41:44,986
Don't you know the world says its fucking name to us?”

510
00:41:45,993 --> 00:41:51,081
“What the fuck?  What the fuck do I have to dream about this for,”

511
00:41:51,335 --> 00:41:54,158
I say to Charlie, “Wasn't I miserable enough?”

512
00:41:54,408 --> 00:41:55,892
“Jane,” fucking Charlie says to me,

513
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:59,720
“Don't you know this is the night you couldn't look out for that little girl

514
00:41:59,944 --> 00:42:03,644
when you was at Cochran's, and Swearengen come in and scared you

515
00:42:04,195 --> 00:42:06,345
and you went down to the creek to weep?

516
00:42:06,578 --> 00:42:08,396
That's where the fuck you're coming from.

517
00:42:08,722 --> 00:42:10,845
And, and, “Don't you know,” he says,

518
00:42:11,206 --> 00:42:14,571
“This is the night you spirit that child from Cochran's,

519
00:42:14,928 --> 00:42:17,532
and to where our stock was outside of camp,

520
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:24,367
and we watched out on that little girl and sung to her, and you,

521
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:30,018
with the presence of mind to continue the fucking round
when I was too fucking stupid?

522
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:31,971
And you said you would…

523
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:38,076
Row, row, row and I said…row, row, row your boat…and we had this…”

524
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:44,155
“Now,” Charlie says to me,

525
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:48,025
“Don't you understand what I'm trying to tell you?

526
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:52,003
Any evenings in your life you made mistakes,

527
00:42:52,313 --> 00:42:59,531
remember where even evenings you was as most ashamed as you ever thought you could ever be

528
00:42:59,841 --> 00:43:07,311
are able to wind up,
and don't fucking only remember the middle of the dream!”

529
00:43:10,545 --> 00:43:15,327
If I wonder why I dreamed that dream…

530
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:18,315
yesterday you sent Mose to find me,

531
00:43:18,315 --> 00:43:23,388
and I was nearly dead-drowned drunk, and Mose made me get up,

532
00:43:23,628 --> 00:43:26,732
and you and me walked them kids to school,

533
00:43:27,113 --> 00:43:33,300
and before I went to sleep you kissed me.

534
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,926
After Tolliver come, and you found Mose to help me.

535
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:42,781
And Charlie to help me find that little girl the very night I got scared and run,

536
00:43:43,076 --> 00:43:46,810
and the both of us sung a round to her,

537
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,343
and then you went ahead and kissed me.

538
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:22,624
To spare you surprise on our advent at the theater in the morning,

539
00:44:23,154 --> 00:44:28,839
I tell you here and now that you will come upon a certain person—

540
00:44:30,698 --> 00:44:33,215
a woman who will be joining us.

541
00:44:34,587 --> 00:44:35,777
Who is she?

542
00:44:36,063 --> 00:44:36,890
Where has she performed?

543
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,487
I believe her name is Joseanne.

544
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:40,236
She is French?

545
00:44:40,933 --> 00:44:41,829
I believe.

546
00:44:42,276 --> 00:44:43,938
I know she's spent time in Paris.

547
00:44:44,245 --> 00:44:45,791
Where has she performed?

548
00:44:46,029 --> 00:44:49,003
She has performed nowhere that we would have knowledge of, to my knowledge.

549
00:44:50,422 --> 00:44:51,370
Joseanne?

550
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:52,235
Yes.

551
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:53,527
Living at the theater?

552
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:54,809
Temporarily.

553
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:57,134
To be installed thereafter where?

554
00:44:57,134 --> 00:44:58,447
Shut up!

555
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:01,963
I won't have it, this is getting off on the wrong foot.

556
00:45:01,963 --> 00:45:05,652
So you commit us to a long relation with Joseanne.

557
00:45:05,652 --> 00:45:09,089
You will find her at the Goddamn theater in the morning is what I mean!

558
00:45:09,089 --> 00:45:13,086
And I won't have this Goddamn wrong-footedness.

559
00:45:15,944 --> 00:45:17,945
Mean-spirited is what I mean.

560
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:21,849
A lack of generosity.  Selfishness.

561
00:45:22,444 --> 00:45:23,998
Don't you think it all has an effect…

562
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:30,982
on your performance?

563
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:35,371
Does this performance seem genuine?

564
00:46:00,286 --> 00:46:03,693
Situation being fluid and not likely to get less so for a while,

565
00:46:03,903 --> 00:46:05,588
I went ahead and reordered hames.

566
00:46:09,213 --> 00:46:14,058
Steve, made imbecile by that horse's hoof, he couldn't authorize it.

567
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:21,191
But I went ahead and assumed whoever finally takes the livery overmight want a restock of hames.

568
00:46:21,191 --> 00:46:23,275
So I ordered ‘em.

569
00:46:32,596 --> 00:46:35,096
Let us give thanks.

570
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:44,933
