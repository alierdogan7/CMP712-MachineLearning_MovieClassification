1
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,740
Get him! Kill him! Get him!

2
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:28,625
Come on!

3
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,660
Get him!
Come on! Get him!

4
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,634
It's about time you learned
respect for a real fightin' dog, Hazel!

5
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,407
Get up, you no good
piece of dung!

6
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,343
Get up!

7
00:04:03,556 --> 00:04:06,525
Get up! Get up, dog!

8
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,700
Goddamnit! I'll kill you myself!

9
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,460
You damage my fightin' dog, you're
gonna be nothin' but a sack of guts.

10
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,420
I'll kill you myself,
you son of a bitch!

11
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,260
The dog's half dead.
I'm buying him.

12
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,060
I ain't sellin'.
Not for no hundred.

13
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,620
That dog's worth two hundred.

14
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,460
Two hundred's what I paid.
That dog's worth a fortune.

15
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,100
A thousand!

16
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,780
He's gonna wish he'd
never seen that dog.

17
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,620
We'll cross again.
Nobody steals from me.

18
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:17,225
Nobody.

19
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,740
- Morning, Sam.
- Howdy.

20
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,860
Them trapper's comin' back in.

21
00:07:02,895 --> 00:07:05,817
Come on! Move!

22
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:08,705
Damn son of a bitch!

23
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,980
Trap ain't gonna get away with this.

24
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,057
At least he paid you $200 for that dog.

25
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:15,100
Shut up about that, Deak.

26
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,025
Morning.

27
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,740
Well, well. Looky here.

28
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,317
Excuse me.

29
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:27,886
Good Morning.

30
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:29,420
Yes it is.

31
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,140
Nothin' good about it so far, General.

32
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,420
Can either of you men direct me
to Sergeant Edgar Millen?

33
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:45,420
Yeah, sure.
You come with us.

34
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,500
We'll take you to Sergeant Millen.

35
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,300
Hello, Hazel.
Who's your friend?

36
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,540
Who goes there?

37
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,700
Edgar, some damn squirrely
trapper stole my best huntin' dog!

38
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:12,940
Somebody stole my dog!

39
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:15,100
Go away, Hazel.

40
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,300
That's Sergeant Millen.

41
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,820
What are you staring at?

42
00:08:24,855 --> 00:08:27,140
Are you Sergeant Edgar Millen?

43
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:28,625
Unfortunately.

44
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,140
That look on your face could
turn good whiskey into sour piss.

45
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,940
You gotta to do something
about this, Edgar.

46
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:41,745
Sound off, kid.

47
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,300
Constable Alvin Adams
reporting for duty, Sergeant!

48
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,460
Well, well, well.

49
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,580
Now, look what they sent.

50
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,860
Hell, Edgar, that was
my strongest dog.

51
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:10,585
You were fighting that dog, Hazel.

52
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,558
And from what I hear,
your strongest dog was

53
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,370
a hair's breadth away from being bait.

54
00:09:14,695 --> 00:09:16,700
That's a damned lie. I got witnesses!

55
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,705
What have you got there?

56
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,160
It's a 2 way radio, sir.
The newest thing.

57
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,767
Kids always got something
new that don't work.

58
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:28,305
This one works. I was
trained in communications.

59
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,020
This mountie here says that man
should be brought up for trial.

60
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:32,545
Now, what are you
going to do, Edgar?

61
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,900
I'm going to close my eyes
and pray you disappear.

62
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,140
Never had much luck prayin'.

63
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,025
Hey, welcome, stranger.

64
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,585
Come on in and warm yourself up.

65
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,380
My name's W.W. I ain't seen
you in these parts before.

66
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:20,900
Where you comin' from?

67
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,140
- Oh, nowhere.
- Everybody has to be from somewhere.

68
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,434
I can tell you ain't one of them fools
that come up here from the south

69
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:32,743
to get out of them breadlines.

70
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,825
Half of them starve to death
and the other half freeze.

71
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,340
More dead bodies up here in the last
few years than I've seen in a lifetime

72
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,105
and believe me, I've
been here a while.

73
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,460
This store can't hold all the
ammo you got on this here list.

74
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,821
But I'll get you what I got.

75
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,475
Huntin' grizzlies, I expect, ain't you?

76
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:55,860
If you're heading up to old Curley's,
I can save you the journey.

77
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:57,820
Skeeters got him last spring.

78
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,100
Ate through his eyelids and
pumped him full of poison.

79
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:08,220
Curley finally got a gun
and blew his brains out.

80
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:10,500
That's one way to stop the buzzin'.

81
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,220
Recon so. Think you'll be
needing anything else?

82
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:17,221
Nope.

83
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,860
That'll be one hundred and...

84
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,940
let's see... a hundred even.

85
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:28,344
Rough travelin' at night.

86
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:30,740
You're welcome to stay.
We could talk some more.

87
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,620
Outpost to base, over.

88
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,420
Okay.

89
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:54,437
Your two. And two back.

90
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,615
I'm out.

91
00:12:00,604 --> 00:12:02,048
I'll see you.

92
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,367
Read 'em and weep.

93
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:04,651
Two pair of kings up.

94
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:06,737
Hold it.

95
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:08,660
Three eights.

96
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,660
You black bastard.

97
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,060
Jesus, kid - do we have to
hear that now?

98
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,300
I'll have it set up real soon.

99
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:23,585
Swell...

100
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,721
...so then we can hear them
pen pushing heroes in Edmonton

101
00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:28,381
giving us orders, eh?

102
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,940
I was thinking maybe we should have
arrested those men for dog fighting,

103
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:34,710
and that trapper, too.

104
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:36,445
Dealer stands pat.

105
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:38,612
Technically, under the
Commonwealth statuates,

106
00:12:38,614 --> 00:12:40,458
if the man Hazel didn't
want to sell his dog...

107
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,860
Looks like we got to
build a big new jail.

108
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,437
Alvin's going to
arrest the whole town.

109
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:47,846
Let me give you
a little advice, eh, kid?

110
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:50,185
Just throw those law books away.

111
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,180
Better to turn your eyes and let
them fight their damn dogs.

112
00:12:53,215 --> 00:12:56,185
It's a damn sight better
than them killing each other.

113
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,260
But you can't let people get away
with that - making their own laws.

114
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,225
The only thing you have to
remember is Millen's law:

115
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,560
You want to stay a mountie, then all you
got to do is keep headquarters happy.

116
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:09,825
And the only time they're unhappy is when
there's a killing that's not accounted for.

117
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,500
So you account for all killings, and you
live to be an old mountie, just like me.

118
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:16,060
You got that?

119
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,980
Yes, sir.

120
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,945
Hey, kid...

121
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,489
I ain't a "sir", a "mister", or a "grandpa".

122
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:30,621
Now, you got that?

123
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,814
This is not going to feel very friendly.

124
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:43,592
(whines)

125
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,820
It'll do you a lot of good.

126
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,341
I even use it myself sometimes.

127
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:11,022
You had the strength to come this far.

128
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,623
I think you're gonna make it.

129
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,420
Hell of a life bein' a mountie,
ain't it, kid?

130
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,180
Yeah, great.

131
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,860
Alvin... you want a piece
of this buffalo woman?

132
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,320
Might help you sleep.

133
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:15,180
I don't need any help.

134
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:24,253
Yeah.

135
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,689
Buffalo woman's taken a liking to Alvin.

136
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,700
Probably gettin' tired of old men like us.

137
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:49,540
Wants some younger blood.

138
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,620
You speak for yourself.

139
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:56,420
I've still got plenty of fire left in me.

140
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,500
I was speaking for myself.

141
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:08,156
(bark)

142
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,780
If you want this piece,
you'll have to come get it.

143
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:02,260
Come on.

144
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,380
Come on, now.

145
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,647
The least you can do to show your
appreciation for a free meal...

146
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:18,900
...is to come get it.

147
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,580
Here you are.

148
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,180
Good boy. Come on.

149
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,500
Good boy.

150
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,588
Hot damn! Boy, you sure can shoot!

151
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,745
Not bad.

152
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,385
Pulled your shot, eh?
Got him in the kidney.

153
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,465
If that had been a grizzler,
you'd have been jacked.

154
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,480
Well, it wasn't a damn grizzler,
and I'm not dead.

155
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:30,425
Millen, don't you ever have anything
good to say about anything?

156
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,729
Well, what do you want, kid,
a shout, a holler and a cigar

157
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:34,834
for doing something
halfway right for once?

158
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:36,905
No, I guess not. Your cigars
taste like shit

159
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,705
and you'd probably crack your
face if you laughed out loud.

160
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,300
Clean your kill.

161
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100
You know, if he didn't like you,
he wouldn't say nothing.

162
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,800
No, he's just in a hurry to
get back to his rotgut.

163
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,800
He wasn't always that way.

164
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,339
Come on, let's skin this
before it freezes, eh?

165
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,540
No normal man lives in
a little biddy hole like that.

166
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:09,265
What the fuck we gonna do now?

167
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,660
This is the dumbest thing I've ever done.

168
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:15,145
Oh, yeah? What about Leon?

169
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,847
I'm gonna get my dog.

170
00:19:16,882 --> 00:19:19,780
I thought I asked you not
to bring that up again.

171
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:21,220
Bring what up?

172
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,380
- Uh, what's his name.
- Leon?

173
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,540
That's dumb.

174
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,180
Yeah. Shut up, Deak.
You're dumb.

175
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,540
If we don't get where it's warm, we're
gonna be nothin' but statues out here.

176
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:40,060
Couldn't fit no more
than 2 in that hole.

177
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,540
Ain't no way in hell he's
gonna let Tom and I in there.

178
00:19:43,575 --> 00:19:45,620
Well, I sure as hell
ain't goin' up there.

179
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,060
Dumb! Leon!

180
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:54,608
Yeah? You're dumb!

181
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,200
You're so dumb
I could sell you dirt!

182
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,220
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

183
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,500
I am sorry, okay?
I shouldn't have said that.

184
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,860
Dumb asshole.

185
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,049
Before you two kill each other,
there's something I want you to do.

186
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,460
This is the dumbest
thing I've ever done.

187
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,460
Hazel's dog ain't chained.

188
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,260
We don't want no trouble, mister!

189
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,740
We're real hungry and cold!

190
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,540
You let us warm ourselves
... any spare food...

191
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:11,145
...we pay you twice the
cost for the trouble!

192
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,705
I'd feel better if you'd
lay those rifles down.

193
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,105
Sorry, mister, but...

194
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,420
...the dog wasn't chained, so...

195
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,545
Don't have any room in the cabin, but

196
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:37,188
if you want to get warm, you can
build yourselves a fire right around there.

197
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,460
Yes, sir. Thank You.

198
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:47,105
We do appreciate it.

199
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,820
Make you some food.

200
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,540
Get down.

201
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,420
- There you are.
- Thanks, mister.

202
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,180
Get down! No! Get down!

203
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,460
Get down! Get down!

204
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,480
Goddamn!

205
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:34,380
Help me, somebody!

206
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,780
Kill that goddamn dog!

207
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,780
Kill that goddamn dog!

208
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,820
- Let's get out of here..
- Son of a bitch!

209
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:10,225
Shot his scalp off!

210
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,060
That son of a bitch
has killed somebody!

211
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,420
Come on, let's go!

212
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,420
We had been married 9 years,
when my late husband left me

213
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:30,660
to come here and make his fortune.

214
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,678
After a short time, what little
money we had was gone, but

215
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:38,100
I managed alright on my own.

216
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,980
Now, all that's left to
remember him by is...

217
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:44,900
...this broken watch...

218
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,048
...and a trapper's license.

219
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,060
And I thank you for
holding these things for me.

220
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,340
But I want you all to know...

221
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,260
...that I'm glad I came here.

222
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:04,380
Because it wasn't until now that

223
00:24:04,415 --> 00:24:07,505
I fully realized

224
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,140
how little I cared for the man...

225
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:12,500
...that I will not miss him.

226
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,140
Well...

227
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,980
Happy 1932.

228
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,905
Oh, you feel good.

229
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,180
You feel pretty good yourself.

230
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:40,705
Take it easy, kid. Easy.

231
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,540
You've got a lot of potential for a rookie,

232
00:24:42,575 --> 00:24:43,957
but damn, you're ragged.

233
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:45,305
What do you mean, ragged?

234
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,040
Look, if you're in a do or die
contest with big stakes

235
00:24:48,075 --> 00:24:50,705
you let the other guy
get a head start on you.

236
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,220
Take smaller swigs and
hold your breath, eh?

237
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,025
It looks like it's getting to your head.

238
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,620
When you see it's getting to him,

239
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,189
turn that sucker up
and bust it on down.

240
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:12,660
then you pray to the Lord you get the
hell out before you fall flat on your ass.

241
00:25:12,695 --> 00:25:15,300
Where did you learn
them high school tricks?

242
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,180
Smooth - boy,
you've got to think smooth.

243
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:35,713
You're standing on my feet.

244
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,780
Sorry. You want me
to take my boots off?

245
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,140
- Where'd you say you learned this?
- Louisiana.

246
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:54,580
Louisiana?

247
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,220
You know, I used to practice
on my uncle's still.

248
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,780
Damn, I'd drink his whiskey
better than anybody around.

249
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,580
So, my uncle named that whiskey
after me:

250
00:26:04,615 --> 00:26:06,145
Sundog whiskey.

251
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,562
That's a goddamned lie.

252
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:12,000
That whiskey was called Sundog
a hundred years before you were born.

253
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:13,980
Go on. Tell them what
your real name was.

254
00:26:14,513 --> 00:26:15,557
Go on.

255
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,660
- I ain't ashamed of it.
- What is it?

256
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,860
George Washington
Lincoln Brown.

257
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:33,914
Yuck, yuck, yuck!

258
00:26:35,255 --> 00:26:37,185
What's so damn funny about that?

259
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,340
Nothin'. Not a thing, Mr President.

260
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:43,785
No, but he was a first rate pitcher
with the Negro League.

261
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,881
Then he tried to make
the move over to the majors

262
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:48,661
by saying he was a Jamaican.

263
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,200
- Or was it Cuban?
- Mexican.

264
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,620
You don't look Mexican.

265
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,580
They didn't want to let me in
the majors and you know why.

266
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:02,156
Damn right I know why. I must've
heard that story 600 times.

267
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,145
Because I was too damn good.
That's why.

268
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,865
Hell, I'd have pitched that ball
down Ty Cobb's throat,

269
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:10,660
and made George Sisler
look like a damn electric fan.

270
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:13,820
They'll never let a Negro
do that to a white fellow. Never.

271
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:15,500
No shit.

272
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:24,100
I just kept trying to keep out of the
cold, and that was good enough for me.

273
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:25,580
Excuse me.

274
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,740
Alvin, she wants to know when
you can be ready for her.

275
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,860
- Tell her soon.
- She says you're a virgin.

276
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,940
She says you walk like you've
got a roll of nickles up your ass.

277
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,945
She says she can wait
for you in the bedrroom.

278
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,220
Well, there's nothing in the book that
says fucking's against the law.

279
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,820
- I'm surprised.
- About what?

280
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,060
- This.
- What?

281
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,380
What about you?

282
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,700
What about me?

283
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,780
Well...

284
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,665
I mean...

285
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,720
didn't it mean anything?

286
00:28:46,755 --> 00:28:48,740
Oh, God, woman, please.

287
00:28:54,287 --> 00:28:56,905
Get your hands off me!
Where is he?!

288
00:28:56,907 --> 00:29:00,860
I've got to talk to him now!
Get out of my way!

289
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:02,585
Edgar!

290
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,620
That crazy son of a bitch killed Jimmy Tom!
The fucker who stole my dog!

291
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,380
And you let him be!

292
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,145
Crazy bastard!

293
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,900
Do you hear me Edgar?!
Jimmy Tom is dead!

294
00:29:14,935 --> 00:29:17,357
I'll take care of it.

295
00:29:17,392 --> 00:29:19,745
Jimmy Tom is dead!

296
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,780
I told you I would take care of it.

297
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,500
Get up!

298
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,220
A friendly fella.

299
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,540
He set right where you are, boy,
and paid for everyting with $100 bills.

300
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:56,551
Hey, he just wanted some supplies.

301
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:00,060
Bought two of my best shotguns
and 700 rounds of ammo.

302
00:30:00,095 --> 00:30:02,825
From the way he acted,
he didn't look crazy to me...

303
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,220
...at least not any more crazy
than anyone else around here.

304
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:08,777
You dumb fuck.
You lost what brains you had.

305
00:30:08,812 --> 00:30:11,300
How the hell was I supposed
to know who he was?

306
00:30:11,335 --> 00:30:13,385
700 rounds of ammo?

307
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,500
Bought it all. He had a lot of money.

308
00:30:16,535 --> 00:30:18,185
Who is this guy?

309
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,580
Ever hear of the mad trapper - the one
who steals gold from men's teeth?

310
00:30:21,615 --> 00:30:24,457
Yes, I've heard of him.
You think this guy's him?

311
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:27,300
Sure it's him! How else
would he get all that money?

312
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:29,780
Must have made a fortune in gold.

313
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,825
It doesn't make sense.

314
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,625
Listen here to the high fallootin' expert.
Tell us what makes sense.

315
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,620
I just figure any man who'll
risk his neck to save a dog's life

316
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:41,940
isn't going to kill somebody for gold teeth.

317
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:44,820
Wrong, boy. He's the mad trapper, alright.

318
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,540
Deak, I want to talk to you.

319
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,420
What really happened last night?

320
00:31:03,455 --> 00:31:04,820
I told you.

321
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,540
Deak, I have to know everything
about this man we're going after.

322
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,500
I gotta know him so good,
I can taste him.

323
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:23,300
Now, how did you get a rifle butt
in your face without killing him?

324
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,023
He shot first, Edgar!
Honest to Christ!

325
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,100
Hold this, will you?

326
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,020
Ready.

327
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,820
We'll get that son of a bitch.

328
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,480
Alright.

329
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:40,860
Let's go.

330
00:34:04,577 --> 00:34:06,580
Don't kill me, Albert.

331
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,380
I expect that's you.

332
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,380
Hello, Bill.

333
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,060
Well... what brings you back?

334
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,420
Too damn crowded.

335
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,980
Gettin' that way all over.

336
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,600
Now, listen to me Albert,
'cause you ain't got much time.

337
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,500
Things are not the same
as when you left here.

338
00:34:33,535 --> 00:34:36,020
They put up a town about 7 years ago.

339
00:34:36,055 --> 00:34:37,620
Just a few hours from here...

340
00:34:37,655 --> 00:34:39,425
...in good weather.

341
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,380
There's a Mountie outpost
there, and radios

342
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:45,300
and newspapers come in
from Toronto almost regular.

343
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:47,625
It's different, Albert.

344
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:51,500
There's a mountie there named
Edgar Millen, and he's coming after you.

345
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:53,957
I guess he'll bring a whole
bunch of others with him.

346
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:56,345
But he's the last man in the world

347
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,140
that anybody'd want on his trail.

348
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:01,580
They're gonna kill you.

349
00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:04,625
Am I gettin' through to you, Albert?

350
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,105
- I understand what you're sayin'.
- Good.

351
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,380
Then you'll also understand when
I tell you to get the hell out of here.

352
00:35:11,415 --> 00:35:13,785
Head south.

353
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,500
I appreciate you coming
over here to tell me that, Bill.

354
00:35:17,535 --> 00:35:19,957
But you ain't runnin', that it?

355
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,380
Got no place to go.

356
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,453
Your father never had
anything against running.

357
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,260
I don't guess anybody ever really
wanted to catch up to him, anyway.

358
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,580
He's gone, isn't he?

359
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,524
He died in a prison hospital.

360
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,420
Where you headed?

361
00:35:48,455 --> 00:35:52,143
Well, I guess I'll head up
into the high country.

362
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:53,820
Do some trappin'.

363
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,820
- Good hunting.
- Same to you, Albert.

364
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,705
Come on, boy.

365
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,940
See you around, Albert!

366
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,100
Tie those horses up.

367
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,340
Keep that fire goin'.

368
00:37:28,945 --> 00:37:32,500
Yeah... he knows we're here.

369
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,300
Come on. Come on.

370
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,700
You stick with me, kid...

371
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:50,500
...and stay low.

372
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,820
Switch with me, Ned.
I want a shot at the front.

373
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:14,420
It's a deal.

374
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,500
Johnson!

375
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,820
This is Edgar Millen of the Royal
Canadian Polce talking to you!

376
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:35,265
I don't want any trouble

377
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,180
and I don't want to see
nobody else get hurt!

378
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,420
I'm coming in to talk to you!

379
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,420
Now, hear me out!

380
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,665
Edgar, what are you doing?

381
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,540
If he wanted a fire fight
he would have started.

382
00:38:53,575 --> 00:38:55,340
He ain't crazy.

383
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,520
Naw, he ain't crazy.

384
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:02,660
You're the one who's crazy.

385
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,420
You don't look like a madman.

386
00:39:40,455 --> 00:39:42,820
You look like a mountie.

387
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,340
Johnson, we've got a
bad situation out here.

388
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,945
The dead body over there...

389
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,220
...probably has your bullet in him.

390
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,580
I have a pretty fair idea
what happened out here.

391
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,480
Then leave me be.

392
00:40:11,515 --> 00:40:14,225
I just can't do that.

393
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,820
I have to take you in
and clear this up.

394
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,780
That's the law. I can't change it.

395
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,560
To you, I'm just a name on
a form you have to fill out.

396
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:31,180
I have a bunch of savages out here

397
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:33,940
just aching to splatter you
all over the place.

398
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,220
They don't want your side at all..

399
00:40:38,255 --> 00:40:40,745
Now, if you don't come in with me,

400
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,340
that's all the excuse they'll need.

401
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,740
They'll either kill you...

402
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:54,980
...or get themselves killed tryin'.
I can't let that happen.

403
00:40:55,015 --> 00:40:57,905
You can't stop it.

404
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,980
No, I can't.
Not without your help.

405
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,460
You come in wth me
and clear this up...

406
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,700
...I'll have you back
out here in 3 days.

407
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,740
I'll guarantee your safety
into town and back.

408
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,420
But if you don't come in...

409
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,820
Hold it!

410
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,060
Don't shoot!

411
00:41:45,095 --> 00:41:46,620
Hold it!

412
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,460
You son of a bitch!

413
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,620
You okay?

414
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:50,494
Yeah.

415
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,940
I can't leave without bringin' you in!

416
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,860
I hope you sons of bitches
can finish what you started.

417
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,305
We gonna wait him out?

418
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,020
We'd run out of food
or freeze before he does.

419
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,100
He's got too much mud on
the cabin to burn him out.

420
00:43:19,135 --> 00:43:22,481
He's cut firing slits
about a foot above the floor.

421
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,740
He'll be on his belly.

422
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,865
Shoot low.

423
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,660
Pass the word.
Shoot low.

424
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,910
Millen says shoot low - aim at the slits
above the ground. Pass the word.

425
00:43:49,603 --> 00:43:53,051
Lewis. Shoot low.
He's on the cabin floor.

426
00:43:53,086 --> 00:43:55,145
Pass it on.

427
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,940
Charlie, shoot low.
Pass it on.

428
00:43:57,975 --> 00:44:00,300
Low. Shoot low.

429
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,580
Fire low, Deak. Fire low.

430
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,480
I'm gonna get his scalp!

431
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,820
- Go get him Charlie!
- Get 'em Charlie!

432
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,980
Break it in!

433
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,300
Welcome.

434
00:46:29,307 --> 00:46:31,740
Holy shit! Let's get out of here!

435
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,860
I'll bury the guy!

436
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,727
Ahhh! I'm blind!

437
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,604
- Get down, Lewis!
- I'm blind!

438
00:46:51,968 --> 00:46:53,223
Get down!

439
00:46:53,258 --> 00:46:55,647
Jesus, I can't see!

440
00:46:56,554 --> 00:46:59,905
Holy shit! Lay down!

441
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,820
- Big fucking pig!
- Stupid bastard!

442
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,380
You haven't fired a shot!

443
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:39,764
Ow! Owww!

444
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:54,320
Sundog!
Step on the other spring!

445
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,260
Come on. Let's go.

446
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,300
We got to thaw out the dynamite, kid.
But not in the fire.

447
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,220
If you get popped and you drop that,
you know what happens.

448
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,345
Look at these hands.

449
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,540
Sure have a great pitcher's hands.

450
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,840
My mama, bless her soul...

451
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:30,807
...always said my hands
were the best part of me.

452
00:48:30,842 --> 00:48:34,834
And your father said the best part
of you ran down your mama's leg.

453
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,020
Hope you can fuck
better than you can play.

454
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,140
I cooked up some fish for you fellas.

455
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,345
What are you laughin' at?

456
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,780
I wasn't laughing.
I was just musing to myself.

457
00:49:40,815 --> 00:49:44,100
Musing? Big, dumb shit.

458
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,100
I'll slice your tongue out.

459
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,340
Try it, asshole. Try it!

460
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:53,580
I might!

461
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:03,306
Maybe Mr Johnson aught to know
about them pretty little teeth you got.

462
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,260
Maybe I'll go tell him.

463
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,900
No. Deak, please don't.

464
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,300
You asshole.

465
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:25,354
(singing)

466
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:32,145
Well, I'll be damned.

467
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,980
Hell of a way for a man to die -
being blown up.

468
00:50:35,015 --> 00:50:37,905
Yeah - be a good man
to have on your side.

469
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,585
Too bad we got to
kill the son of a bitch.

470
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,500
Johnson would have given himself up
if he hadn't been guilty of something.

471
00:50:44,535 --> 00:50:46,220
Guess I was wrong about him.

472
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,288
Most would have run
if they had the chance.

473
00:50:49,323 --> 00:50:52,180
A piece of ground can be
mighty important to a man.

474
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,545
Shit!

475
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,300
Jesus, kid.

476
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,020
Alright, let's go.

477
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:05,450
(singing)

478
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,460
Follow him.

479
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,465
What's our job in this, Edgar?

480
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,220
Surround the cabin and
stay out of my way.

481
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,420
Let's go!

482
00:52:32,477 --> 00:52:34,405
Come on, baby.

483
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,460
Blew him to Kingdom Come!

484
00:53:06,691 --> 00:53:08,528
The light.

485
00:53:08,563 --> 00:53:10,460
Yeah, right here.

486
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,180
<i>Blew that son of a bitch sky high!</i>

487
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,900
<i>We'll get his scalp this time!</i>

488
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,940
Slow it down, boys.

489
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,020
Come on, slow it down!

490
00:53:25,055 --> 00:53:26,745
Easy, now. Easy.

491
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,940
What the hell you talking about?

492
00:53:29,975 --> 00:53:31,540
Goddamn!

493
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,500
Son of a bitch!

494
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,180
Son of a bitch!

495
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,980
He's gone.

496
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,300
He'll be heading North, up to
the snow in the Kruger Pass.

497
00:54:43,335 --> 00:54:44,785
We'll need your dogs, Hazel.

498
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,500
And enough supplies to
stay out a couple of weeks.

499
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:48,745
Let's go!

500
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,580
Bring Ned and the bodies
back to town.

501
00:54:51,615 --> 00:54:53,297
Can't be no normal man.

502
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:54,980
No, he's a killer.

503
00:54:55,015 --> 00:54:56,540
Just a man.

504
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,705
Okay, let's go.

505
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,140
Maybe it was his ghost or something.

506
00:55:01,175 --> 00:55:02,340
Huh, Deak?

507
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:06,780
Big dummy.

508
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,440
Come on, all you guys.
Move over. Get in the picture.

509
00:55:15,475 --> 00:55:18,060
Move over there. Get over.

510
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,058
Would it make any
difference if I wait?

511
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:38,305
If I left now I'd never know

512
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:42,278
what it would have
been like with you.

513
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,340
I guess it's up to me, isn't it?

514
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,700
It's been a long time, now.

515
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:00,742
You're going to have to
kick me out of here, aren't you?

516
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,940
Yeah, right.

517
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,825
Ain't it about time to rest?!

518
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:02,852
No, it ain't. We got to
push until we drop.

519
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,865
Damn it!

520
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,300
Get away from my dog!

521
00:58:11,335 --> 00:58:12,700
Well then, keep him
the hell away from me.

522
00:58:12,735 --> 00:58:15,334
Cut that out, damn it!

523
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,660
Let's go!

524
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,900
He ain't too far away.

525
00:59:04,935 --> 00:59:07,180
Come on. Atta boy.

526
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,100
Hold the dogs.

527
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:36,180
These tracks are strange.
The imprints are deeper in back.

528
00:59:36,215 --> 00:59:37,425
What's that mean?

529
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,860
He's got his snowshoes
on backwards.

530
00:59:39,895 --> 00:59:42,620
He's laying 2 sets of tracks for us.

531
00:59:42,655 --> 00:59:44,145
The man is squirrely.

532
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,860
- He knows what he's doin'.
- Damn right.

533
00:59:46,895 --> 00:59:49,060
He ain't runnin' yet. Let's go.

534
00:59:49,095 --> 00:59:50,940
What do you mean, "He ain't runnin'"?

535
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,563
You see anything, Edgar?

536
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,720
Alright, grab my snowshoes.

537
01:02:45,601 --> 01:02:47,375
Hazel.

538
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,185
Hazel.

539
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:53,305
That's a girl's name, isn't it?

540
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,060
The way I hear it told, Hazel's
mama didn't know if he was

541
01:02:56,095 --> 01:02:58,305
a boy or girl 'till
he was about 15.

542
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:01,900
She didn't much care a few years
later when he turned vicious.

543
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:06,260
Yeah. Everyone up here is vicious.

544
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,665
Like my dog.

545
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,300
Ain't that right, Edgar?

546
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:13,580
Oh, that's right.

547
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:16,380
And you here.

548
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:20,460
You're real civilized.

549
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,640
We don't get many pretty
young white boys like you up here.

550
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:31,300
Only one thing you're good for.

551
01:03:31,335 --> 01:03:32,940
Leave me alone, Hazel.

552
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,060
Son of a bitch!

553
01:04:06,257 --> 01:04:07,813
Stop it!

554
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:23,340
Well, well, well.

555
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:27,900
Look who just got uncivilized.

556
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:10,340
With my plane in the air and my
abilities as a flier, Albert Johnson...

557
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:11,340
Captain!

558
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,745
This way. Hold it.

559
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,500
...doesn't stand a chance.

560
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:20,220
I'm posting a $500 reward

561
01:05:20,255 --> 01:05:22,340
for his capture!

562
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:28,665
My newspaper will match
that offer dollar for dollar!

563
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:32,940
That's $1,000 on the
head of Albert Johnson!

564
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:35,580
Let's go get him!

565
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:46,382
I hope that bastard
stays alive forever, eh?

566
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:49,620
Let's go!

567
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:23,020
It'll be bringing in supplies for us!

568
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,780
Where's Sergeant Millen?

569
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,823
You're looking at him.

570
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,100
I'm Captain Hank Tucker, RCAF.

571
01:08:42,101 --> 01:08:44,200
I've come to bring
the fugitive to justice!

572
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,199
Where's headquarters?

573
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,000
Wherever I'm standin'.

574
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,750
As you can see, he was one of
the Americans' best trained men.

575
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:01,000
Special Intelligence squad in the war.

576
01:09:01,035 --> 01:09:03,220
These pictures were
taken for security.

577
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,785
Yes, I read, Captain.

578
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:07,865
He ain't no rookie.

579
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:11,260
I don't have to remind you,
this is confidential information.

580
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:14,065
Who the hell we going to tell it to?

581
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,660
Volunteers will be arriving
in a couple of days.

582
01:09:16,695 --> 01:09:18,860
Then send them back.

583
01:09:18,895 --> 01:09:20,705
Excuse me, Sergeant?

584
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,920
You heard me.
I said send them back.

585
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:25,065
We don't need anymore
misfits up here.

586
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:28,740
They'll be up here anyway.
There's a $1000 bounty on Johnson.

587
01:09:28,775 --> 01:09:30,505
Now, that's more like it.

588
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:33,380
Good God, Captain. How could you
let a thing like that happen?

589
01:09:33,415 --> 01:09:35,065
We can use that manpower.

590
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,620
To assist me in cutting him off
before he gets in to that river chain.

591
01:09:38,655 --> 01:09:41,700
You really don't know
what's going on, do you?

592
01:09:41,735 --> 01:09:44,065
He's not headed
into the river chain.

593
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,500
He's going to zigzag his way up
the Sunshine Pass to Alaska.

594
01:09:47,535 --> 01:09:48,785
That's impossible.

595
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:51,260
No one's going to make it through
Sunshine Pass this time of year.

596
01:09:51,295 --> 01:09:53,625
Well, this one's going to try.

597
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:55,820
If he gets over that range, he's free.

598
01:09:55,855 --> 01:09:58,105
And neither you nor your plane
can do anything about that.

599
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,711
- Will you just listen?
- No. You listen.

600
01:10:00,746 --> 01:10:03,503
We've been hunting a man who
knows how to live off the land

601
01:10:03,538 --> 01:10:04,959
and use the terrain.

602
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,261
He doesn't have to
feed a large posse.

603
01:10:07,296 --> 01:10:10,980
In my plane, Aklavik is
a mere 20 minutes away.

604
01:10:11,015 --> 01:10:12,425
We've been pushing his tail

605
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,540
so he can't stop to gather food,

606
01:10:14,575 --> 01:10:16,505
or build a fire to warm himself,

607
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:19,260
or fire a shot to give his position away.

608
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:24,265
Captain... have you ever
flown the bush in winter?

609
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,740
My credentials are impeccable, Sergeant.

610
01:10:27,775 --> 01:10:30,225
They sent for me because
I am the best!

611
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:34,580
Now, your superiors know what this is:
one big goddamn embarrasment!

612
01:10:34,615 --> 01:10:38,105
You've had your chance, and your ground
maneuvers have been an abysmal failure.

613
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,740
This is page 1 news,
and it looks just awful!

614
01:10:40,775 --> 01:10:43,510
I see. It'll look good for the Air Corps if

615
01:10:43,545 --> 01:10:47,540
one of your fly boys does what
the men on the ground couldn't, eh?

616
01:10:47,575 --> 01:10:51,340
Face the fact, Sergeant.
This is a new era.

617
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:53,380
The future has arrived.

618
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,740
Well, if you're part of the future...

619
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,460
I don't want to see it.

620
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,740
Clarence...

621
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:17,100
...if I get to Johnson first...

622
01:11:17,135 --> 01:11:19,385
...I'll give you half the reward.

623
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:23,180
You get to him first - you give
me half the reward.

624
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,900
That ain't fair. I want half.

625
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:39,700
Hold your fire, boys.
It's only me, Bill Loose.

626
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:46,060
I thought you was
the mad trapper for sure.

627
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:51,860
You shouldn't be sneakin' up
on guys like that, Bill.

628
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:54,300
- Sit down. Make yourself warm.
- Thank you.

629
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:59,780
How about a drop for the preacher?

630
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:04,420
So...

631
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,905
...you want to help us hunt Johnson?

632
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:09,540
You're one of the best trackers around.

633
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,545
No, thanks.

634
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,500
I prefer to work alone, you know?

635
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:20,620
You need us, Bill. We're the only ones
left who knows what this guy looks like.

636
01:12:20,655 --> 01:12:28,186
Sure... except Millen,
Hazel, Sundog, and...

637
01:12:28,522 --> 01:12:31,731
...and me.

638
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:51,940
There's a lot of gold in
them teeth, Clarence.

639
01:12:51,975 --> 01:12:55,180
Gold at $35 an ounce.

640
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,840
What's eating at you, Edgar?

641
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:58,345
My territory.

642
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:02,540
Not any more, Edgar.
Things change.

643
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,745
I've seen it happen before.

644
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:09,865
If anybody's gonna bring
Albert Johnson in, it's gonna be me.

645
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:14,060
Not some bounty hunter or
fly boy buckin' for promotion.

646
01:15:14,095 --> 01:15:17,140
Why you? Why are you so special?

647
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,620
He deserves me. Not them.

648
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,145
That's Johnson ahead of us.

649
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:05,145
He's runnin' with the caribou,
trying to throw us off.

650
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:08,500
His strides are gettin' shorter.
Means he's gettin' tired.

651
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,620
There he is!

652
01:19:50,655 --> 01:19:51,785
I see him!

653
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,570
Alright - we got him!

654
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:08,060
- I could have had him!
- You're in a hell of a hurry to kill!

655
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,860
He's on the ridge!

656
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:28,400
He's trapped! We got him!

657
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:36,474
(engine stalls)

658
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,700
George Washington Lincoln Brown.

659
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:10,820
You black bastard.

660
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:18,020
I'll miss you.

661
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:33,740
- We've got to bury him.
- Don't ever grab me.

662
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:35,145
If we don't bury him,
the dogs will eat him.

663
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:37,712
Kill the dogs,
I got a man to hunt.

664
01:23:37,747 --> 01:23:41,180
You got to make up your mind
if you're a priest or a mountie.

665
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:07,985
Hold it!

666
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:10,900
I'll shoot any man that
tries to follow us!

667
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:13,360
Now get back!

668
01:24:13,395 --> 01:24:14,865
Get back!

669
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,840
You've seen what's happened up here!

670
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:18,780
He'll do the same to you!

671
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:24,380
Now, stay out of it!

672
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,625
Come on.

673
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:47,420
You still think you can bring
Albert Johnson in alive?

674
01:25:47,455 --> 01:25:50,517
The pure fact is, he's
runnin' to save his hide.

675
01:25:50,552 --> 01:25:53,580
And every man he killed,
he killed to protect himself.

676
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:55,977
Well, what about
Hawkins and Sundog?

677
01:25:56,012 --> 01:25:58,305
What did any of them die for, Millen?

678
01:25:58,340 --> 01:26:02,380
Johnson didn't do anything I
wouldn't do if I was in his boots.

679
01:26:02,415 --> 01:26:05,380
And if I thought the killing
would stop here...

680
01:26:05,415 --> 01:26:07,500
...I'd let him go.

681
01:28:42,045 --> 01:28:45,020
My old man warned me
never to trust you.

682
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:51,660
I'm going in after him.

683
01:28:51,695 --> 01:28:53,665
Back me.

684
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:55,620
Nail anything that moves...

685
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:59,700
...except me.

686
01:29:24,885 --> 01:29:26,978
Johnson!

687
01:29:57,820 --> 01:29:59,185
We got him.

688
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:01,840
He didn't move like Johnson.

689
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:04,460
Better check it out, but be careful.

690
01:30:04,495 --> 01:30:06,100
Go on!

691
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:29,425
His face is blown off!

692
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:30,945
What did you see up there?

693
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:34,660
Nothin'. Just my eyes
playing tricks on me.

694
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:46,380
Maybe I am too old, eh?

695
01:31:46,415 --> 01:31:48,580
Well, what about Johnson?

696
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:54,420
As far as I'm concerned...
that's Albert Johnson,

697
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:21,465
Now you're in charge.

698
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:24,100
It's up to you
when the killing stops.

699
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:47,220
He's dead, alright.

700
01:32:47,255 --> 01:32:48,700
Get away from him.

701
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:56,660
There he is.

702
01:32:57,980 --> 01:33:02,020
Jesus, will you look at that.
Teeth! Gold Fillings!

703
01:33:02,055 --> 01:33:06,060
Johnson's got a whole
bag of gold fillings here.

704
01:33:06,282 --> 01:33:08,792
He's the goddamn Mad Trapper!

705
01:33:08,827 --> 01:33:14,668
Who shot him?
Who shot Albert Johnson?

706
01:33:14,703 --> 01:33:17,185
Millen.

707
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:19,413
Edgar Millen killed
Albert Johnson.

708
01:33:19,448 --> 01:33:21,620
Where is he?

709
01:33:22,864 --> 01:33:26,864
Kneel down there.
That's it. That's it. Yeah!
