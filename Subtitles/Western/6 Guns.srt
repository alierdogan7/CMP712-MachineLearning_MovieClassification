What do you mean
"we're done?"

516
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,597
Just that.

517
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:37,302
Wait! Wait, where
do you think you're
going?!

518
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:38,636
Wait!

519
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:42,473
Wait, Mr. Allison,
will you just wait for
one moment?

520
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,376
Where are you going?!
Mr. Allison, where are...?

521
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:49,247
I said I was sorry!
I'm sorry, okay?
I will listen to you!

522
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:54,185
Just wait! MR. ALLISON!
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!

523
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,764
KNOCK, KNOCK,
KNOCK, KNOCK!
Frank, you in there?!

524
00:46:06,832 --> 00:46:10,335
Frank?!
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK!

525
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:14,339
(PANTING)
Frank. They're comin' back.
They killed Deputy Thompson.

526
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:17,575
They killed him
and his whole posse
on the Old Spanish Trail.

527
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:20,545
They're killin' everybody,
Frank. Everybody in their path.

528
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,147
Who's that, Sheriff?

529
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:24,782
Lee Horn!

530
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,886
(PANTING)
What're we gonna do?

531
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:30,088
What're we gonna do, Frank?

532
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:38,563
How many men can
you round up?

533
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,967
Oh, I don't know.
Folks are scared to death

534
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:45,871
After what Lee
Horn's gang done
to Selina and her family.

535
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,572
How many?

536
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,108
I think none, Frank.

537
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:54,079
Reckon it'll just
have to be you
and me, then.

538
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,313
Ah, now, hold
on now.

539
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,748
Why don't I get on
the wire to Tucson?

540
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,584
See if I can get
us some help.

541
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,054
Get on the wire, then.
But if Horn gets here
before help arrives,

542
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:05,323
We better be ready
for 'em.

543
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:06,992
Gonna go wire.

549
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,593
It's a good way
to get yourself killed.

550
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:21,599
Thought you
were leaving.

551
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:24,202
What are you
doin' here?

552
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:30,175
I want you to finish
teachin' me
how to shoot.

553
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,348
Well?

554
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,055
I'll be back
by tomorrow.

555
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:55,700
Now, this holster,
you're gonna have to pull
straight up and out.

556
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:59,370
Or else it's
gonna hang up
every time. Try it.

557
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,942
Alright, well,
let's try shooting,
alright?

558
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:08,246
Remember, arm out in
front, both eyes open.

559
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:11,782
Don't cross in front
of your body, or you
won't shoot straight.

560
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:14,785
Now, we're gonna
squeeze the trigger.
Don't yank it.

561
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:17,155
But make it
one fluid motion.

562
00:49:17,222 --> 00:49:19,991
Don't pull it halfway.
Commit to it.

563
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,294
BANG!

564
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:25,230
You yanked.

565
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,499
No, I didn't.
I squeezed!
You yanked!

566
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,638
Okay. Okay.

567
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:35,640
Can I try again?

568
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:39,844
BANG!

569
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,980
Give you somethin'
to shoot at.
Maybe that'll help.

570
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:55,326
Try and remember
everything I told you.

00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:07,905
You expected to hit it?

574
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,774
Yes.

575
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,044
Take you a hundred tries.
And that's if you're lucky.

576
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:19,384
What are you waitin' for?
You got three more shots
in that gun. Shoot.

581
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:46,277
Alright. You're reloaded.

584
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,756
You know, you're
holdin' your breath.

585
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:00,191
No.

586
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:04,362
I told you it would
take a while.

587
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,664
Yeah. You said that
already.

588
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:14,439
How many men
have you killed?

589
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,246
Twelve. I've killed
twelve men.

590
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,850
Is it hard?
To shoot someone?

591
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:32,723
Shootin' them
is not hard. Killing 'em
is something else entirely.

592
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,998
But you only kill a man
when he tries to kill you.

593
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:43,201
Or if maybe he
deserves to die?

594
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:47,638
Wouldn't be my right
to judge that.

595
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:52,443
But what if they'd done
something... so horrible
that...

596
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:56,247
Like what Lee Horn
did to you?

597
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:01,519
Yes.

598
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:05,790
Be my duty
to turn 'em over
to the law.

599
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:09,160
But what if it
was YOUR family,
YOUR life?

600
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:15,433
You'd kill 'em,
Mr. Allison.
You know you would.

601
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:21,138
Yeah. Yeah,
I'd kill 'em.

00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:40,325
See you tomorrow morning?

605
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:46,564
I ain't learned to shoot yet.

606
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:49,434
All day, and I didn't
hit a damn bottle.

607
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,636
Said you'd teach me to shoot.

608
00:52:52,737 --> 00:52:54,705
Tomorrow, then.

609
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:25,736

Whoa.

Selina, how are you?

618
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:21,392
Frank, can I, can I talk
to you for a minute?

619
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:24,495
Why don't you reload
and keep practicin'?

620
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:32,236
BANG!

621
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:34,271
Tucson dispatched
a couple of U.S. Marshalls

622
00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:38,576
And a couple of deputies
to come out here,
after they got my wire.

623
00:54:38,643 --> 00:54:43,080
Well, got word
that they found Lee Horn.

624
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:47,518
So they set up a whole ambush
in this place called "Dog Creek"

625
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:49,587
On the Gila Trail,
about two days ago.

626
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:51,221
Yeah. I know
the place.

627
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:56,093
Well... a mail messenger
found 'em, dead.

628
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,294
Who?

629
00:54:57,362 --> 00:55:00,465
The two U.S. Marshalls
and the deputies!

630
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:04,569
The Gila Trail, that
hits the main road
into town?

631
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:10,375
Yeah, well, any idea how
soon they'd be here if they
was to come from Dog Creek?

632
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:13,978
About two days,
I reckon.

633
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,514
What about Tucson?
They sending anyone?

634
00:55:16,581 --> 00:55:20,317
Oh, nah. They got... they got
half a regiment

635
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:23,253
Chasing some Apaches
up the side of a mountain.

636
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,457
They said they can't
spare anyone for week.

637
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:28,258
Anyone else you
can call on?

638
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:33,531
Well, that would be
Deputy Thompson,
but Lee killed him.

639
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:37,668
They're all dead, Frank.
There ain't nobody left!

640
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:39,904
Lee Horn done
killed 'em all!

641
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,009
So what're we gonna do?

642
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:51,582
BANG!

643
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,961
Why don't you
stay here tonight?

644
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:05,329
Pardon?

645
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:07,598
You're just gonna be back
here in the morning.

646
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:10,668
Put down your things.
I'll make us some supper.

647
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:30,555
Don't reckon I've ever had
a roast this good before.

648
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:34,959
Pot roast was
Will's favorite.

649
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:38,395
He'd eat it every day.
Breakfast, lunch and supper.

650
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:45,002
Stick his nose in the kitchen,
say, "Cookin' a roast?"

651
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:50,074
Yeah, well... vegetables,
chicken, bread.

652
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,744
He always thought
he smelled a pot roast.

653
00:57:08,726 --> 00:57:11,028
You have everything
you need, Mr. Allison?

654
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:16,166
Hey, you can call
me "Frank".

655
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:18,035

00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:53,731
Get my boys a room.
And there's more
where that came from.

to try and MOVE and shoot.

are too far away.

I want you to try
and find a spot.
Fire two shots from cover.

678

Just to keep their heads down
and then try and get closer.

gonna get shot.

It's flat different.
You're moving now.
It takes a lot of practice.

689
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:45,710
Look, when you get
to cover, take a second.
Don't rush your shot.

690
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:51,248
Know where you're gonna
shoot before you do. See it
without looking. Then shoot.

691
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,550
That make sense?

692
01:00:53,617 --> 01:00:55,652

in a real gunfight?

my question?

This what it's like
in a real gunfight?

699

Can't answer that.
Why not?

That's alright, Samuel.
Maybe later.

709
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:15,365

We're on a cattle drive,

They got that look, Frank.
They're murderers. I could
see it in their eyes.

741

You actually see Horn?

Lee Horn, but I know

you can do to help.

860
01:15:23,553 --> 01:15:25,722
Yeah!
(GROANS)

861
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,427
Why did you come back
to Bisbee?!

862
01:15:31,494 --> 01:15:34,964
Because we wanted
to finish, we
wanted to finish...

863
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,499
Finish what?

864
01:15:36,566 --> 01:15:39,502
(LAUGHING)

865
01:15:39,569 --> 01:15:42,639
That's it...
gonna kill her...

866
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:50,614
VILMA: Oh, my God.
Is he dead?

867
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:55,484
Not yet.

868
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:59,789
Y'know, I don't much like
whores. So you're gonna be
quiet. You understand?

869
01:16:00,957 --> 01:16:03,326
Else you'll end up
just like him.

870
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:12,736
What're you doing?

871
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:14,804
Back in a while.

872
01:16:14,871 --> 01:16:16,806
Unless you make a racket.

873
01:16:16,873 --> 01:16:19,375
Then I'll be back sooner.

874
01:16:19,442 --> 01:16:21,645
Just leave me
in here?!

875
01:16:24,948 --> 01:16:27,116
Hey, Pete. You awake?

876
01:16:28,818 --> 01:16:30,887
Wake up,
you drunk bastard!

877
01:16:30,954 --> 01:16:33,122
(MUMBLING)
Wait. Wait.

878
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:36,159
What the hell did you do?
Sleep down here
all night?

879
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:37,794
Nah. No sleep.

880
01:16:37,861 --> 01:16:40,730
Well, hurry up and get ready.
We're riding out soon.

881
01:16:40,797 --> 01:16:42,732
Gotta go to
the crapper.

882
01:16:42,799 --> 01:16:44,934
Well, then do it!

883
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,336
CLICK

884
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:10,780
That's a mighty
nasty trick, missy.
Pointin' that gun at me.

885
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:17,821
I got no truck
with you.

886
01:19:19,322 --> 01:19:22,491
You raped me and you
murdered my family.

887
01:19:24,828 --> 01:19:26,695
I had to.

888
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,232
Lee Horn,
he woulda killed me.

889
01:19:33,336 --> 01:19:37,240
Killing me... won't bring
your husband back.

890
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:43,112
Put the gun down.

891
01:19:43,179 --> 01:19:47,817
I will give you something
your husband couldn't.

892
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:51,254
BANG!

893
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:16,679
What's goin' on
out there?

894
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:18,714
Shut up and get back
in that bed.

895
01:20:18,781 --> 01:20:21,317
People are...
SHHH!

896
01:20:22,118 --> 01:20:23,686
Hear that, Lee?

897
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:25,388
Where's Pete?

898
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:28,357
He went to the crapper.
Ah, hell.

899
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:41,971
Where's the Kid?

900
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:45,374
Last I seen him,
he's still bangin'
away on Vilma.

901
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:47,343
Go get him.

902
01:20:54,483 --> 01:20:57,486
Please let me out
of here. Can you just
open the door?

903
01:20:57,553 --> 01:21:00,456
I've been
stuck here for hours!

904
01:21:13,236 --> 01:21:15,471
Who done this?
WHO?!

905
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:18,241
He had a hat on and
big, long coat and...

906
01:21:18,307 --> 01:21:20,709
You give me a name!
I don't know his name!

907
01:21:20,776 --> 01:21:24,080
You give me
somethin' else, or I'll
shoot you where you lie.

908
01:21:24,147 --> 01:21:28,851
All he said was about
some man, killin' some
man and rapin' his wife.

909
01:21:28,918 --> 01:21:32,288
That's all I remember!
That's all I know.
I swear it!

910
01:21:37,193 --> 01:21:40,396
Let me outta here!
PLEASE!

911
01:21:43,499 --> 01:21:47,836
Killed him, Lee! They
shot Tommy! Was talkin'
about Will Stevens.

912
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,705
Think it's that
bounty hunter?

913
01:21:49,772 --> 01:21:53,276
The one the Sheriff's talkin'
about, that Frank Allison?

914
01:21:53,342 --> 01:21:54,743
Lee!

915
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,545
I need you to go
find Pete.

916
01:21:56,612 --> 01:21:58,781
If he's still alive,
we're gonna need him.

917
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:02,051
What?!
I'll go.

918
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:04,553
I told Chris to.
And I'm tellin'
you, I'll go!

919
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,822
I need you on the balcony
with that rifle.

920
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:09,892
You can pick of anybody on the
roof tops or the street.

921
01:22:09,959 --> 01:22:13,362
Chris is twice as fast.
He'll be down there
in half the time.

922
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:16,665
You do this for me?
I can do this, Lee.

923
01:22:16,732 --> 01:22:18,367
Get goin'.

924
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,969
I'm goin'.

What the hell are
you doing?

938
01:24:00,803 --> 01:24:04,307
I killed 'em. I killed
two of those bastards,
Frank!

939
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:08,377
Well, I got Tommy Kleiber.
That just leaves Horn.

940
01:24:08,444 --> 01:24:10,379
We gonna go
get him?

941
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:12,281
I'll handle him.
You've done enough.

942
01:24:12,348 --> 01:24:14,750
But, Frank!
NO!

943
01:24:14,817 --> 01:24:19,788
Horn's a cold killer.
He's not like the others.
He'll hit what he aims at.

944
01:24:19,855 --> 01:24:22,825
So stay here, and
stay down.

945
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:26,795
When this is over,
I'll come back for you.

946
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:28,897
Frank?!

947
01:24:28,964 --> 01:24:30,499

OHH!

01:25:18,147 --> 01:25:19,615
Hello, darlin'.

951
01:25:19,682 --> 01:25:23,752
You're not gonna
be needin' this anymore.

952
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:28,724
Now, who's your friend
out there?

953
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:31,627
Go to hell, you
murdering son of a bitch.

954
01:25:31,694 --> 01:25:34,697
That's the way
you wanna play it.

955
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:40,836
Hello, out there!
I got somethin' I think
you're gonna want!

956
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:45,974
You know, it's a pity
it's come to this.

957
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:48,677
If my friends had done
what they were
supposed to,

958
01:25:48,744 --> 01:25:52,248
We wouldn't be in
this predicament.

959
01:25:52,315 --> 01:25:55,684
Surely there's a peaceful
resolution we can come to.

960
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:58,554
I got a lot of money,
nobody to share it with.

961
01:25:58,621 --> 01:26:01,190
So let's work something out,
shall we?

962
01:26:01,257 --> 01:26:04,493
The only peaceful resolution
is for you
to throw down your guns

963
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,162
And come out
with your hands up, Lee Horn.

964
01:26:08,297 --> 01:26:10,766
You pompous idiot.

965
01:26:16,805 --> 01:26:18,907
I got a better idea.

966
01:26:18,974 --> 01:26:22,911
I'm gonna count to five, and
you're gonna put YOUR guns down.

967
01:26:22,978 --> 01:26:26,014
Or I'll put a bullet
in her head.

968
01:26:26,081 --> 01:26:29,952
One... two... THREE!

969
01:26:39,962 --> 01:26:44,333
Here I am, Horn. No need
to shoot her. Let her go.

970
01:26:46,969 --> 01:26:50,138
The famous Frank Allison.

971
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:53,442
Well indeed, sir, it
has been an honor.

972
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:05,554

Alright, darlin'...

979
01:27:26,842 --> 01:27:31,380
Now I'm gonna finish what
shoulda been finished
a long time ago.

980
01:27:31,447 --> 01:27:32,981
Get off me!

981
01:27:33,048 --> 01:27:35,250
Just like
the last time.

982
01:27:49,298 --> 01:27:51,066
Go to hell!

We got 'em, Will.

988
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:47,890
We killed every last
one of 'em.

989
01:28:47,956 --> 01:28:53,796
May they rot in hell
for what they did to
you and to my boys.

990
01:28:53,862 --> 01:28:55,664
We got 'em.

Well... this is for you.

994
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:11,079
What is it?

995
01:29:11,146 --> 01:29:13,849
It's the reward money
for Lee Horn and his gang.

996
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:16,885
Lee alone was worth
over $500.

997
01:29:18,954 --> 01:29:24,126
The big one... he never
raped me. Supposed to
kill me, but he didn't.

998
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:29,565
I reckon' it's better
I killed him then.
Take this.

999
01:29:29,632 --> 01:29:31,467
I can't take it.

1000
01:29:31,534 --> 01:29:35,938
It's a lot of money. You can
rebuild your life. Live easy
for a long time.

1001
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:44,713
Where you headed?

1002
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:49,885
Up to Naco. After a man
for robbin' a bank in Douglas.

1003
01:29:49,952 --> 01:29:52,521
And back to Tombstone.

1004
01:29:52,588 --> 01:29:57,460
Is that where you're from?
You got family there?

1005
01:29:59,194 --> 01:30:01,129
Yeah.

1006
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:09,171
You take care of yourself,

1007

Hey, Frank.

1008
01:30:15,844 --> 01:30:19,748
You need any help
catching those fellows in Naco?

1009
01:30:19,815 --> 01:30:25,654
No. But if I do,
I know where to find you.
