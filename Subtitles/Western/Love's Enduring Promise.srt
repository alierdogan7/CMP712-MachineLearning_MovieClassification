1
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:45,165
Are you really here with me?

2
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:50,268
- I'm here.
- And you'll never leave me?

3
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:52,431
Never.

4
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:56,102
- Promise?
- Promise.

5
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:58,111
How can I be certain?

6
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:01,512
Because the two
shall become one.

7
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,758
What a wonderful life
you've given me, Clark.

8
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,601
What a wonderful life
we've made together.

9
00:02:23,398 --> 00:02:28,199
Lord, we're grateful that the soil is warm
and ready to be planted.

10
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:30,635
And we ask that
this season's crop be bountiful.

11
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:33,867
We thank you
for this nourishment before us.

12
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:38,606
Bless it to our bodies
and bless this day. Amen.

13
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:40,841
Amen.

14
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:43,315
Hey, where's Missie?

15
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,052
<i>"I thank you again and again for the honor
you've done me in your proposals...</i>

16
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,128
"but to accept them
is absolutely impossible.

17
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:57,198
"I mean, my feelings
in every respect forbid it.

18
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,702
<i>Now, can I speak any plainer?"</i>

19
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:23,049
Hyah! Hyah!

20
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:30,057
And I think I'm old enough
to be riding by myself to school.

21
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:35,102
Charlie's a good horse, and he don't like
standing around all day with nothing to do.

22
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:38,104
How do you know
he don't like standing around?

23
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:40,106
- From Charlie.
- Hyah!

24
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,041
Hey. That was Missie...

25
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,610
on Charlie.

26
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:50,412
I believe it was.

27
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,621
Hyah!

28
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:29,983
Take your seats and get out
your reading primers.

29
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:32,287
Quickly, please.

30
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:38,599
All right. Daniel, please start reading
from the top of page 25.

31
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:50,244
<i>Just makin' sure the teacher
made it here safely.</i>

32
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:54,304
Well, here I am, safe and sound.

33
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,874
I would appreciate it, though, if you made
sure that Arnie and Aaron got here on time.

34
00:04:57,986 --> 00:05:00,648
It's disruptive to the rest of the class
when they enter late.

35
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:05,055
Well, I think they're gonna be here
on time from now on.

36
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,687
You have a very nice day,
Miss Davis.

37
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:15,465
<i>- All right, Daniel.
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

38
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:25,836
Get on up. Ho.

39
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:33,150
- How you doin', Zeke?
- Gettin' by.

40
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:37,384
I just took the boys to school.
Late again.

41
00:05:37,492 --> 00:05:40,290
<i>I'll tell you, though,
I wish they'd stay young forever.</i>

42
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:42,795
How old's that boy
of yours now?

43
00:05:42,898 --> 00:05:45,731
He'll be 10
on his next birthday.

44
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:49,634
- And the younger one?
- Arnie? He's seven.

45
00:05:49,738 --> 00:05:52,400
<i>He's got it in his head, though,
that one of these days...</i>

46
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:55,237
he and Aaron are going to swap places
and he's gonna be the older brother.

47
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:57,811
Yeah, well.

48
00:05:57,913 --> 00:06:02,316
Boys sure are
full of big ideas.

49
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:05,079
Yeah.

50
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:07,314
<i>Any word from your boy?</i>

51
00:06:09,758 --> 00:06:13,387
Well, like you said...

52
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:16,589
boys are full of big ideas.

53
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:30,039
Lunch.

54
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:50,597
<i>No. Get your own.</i>

55
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:56,262
I was wondering if you'd
do me a favor, Clara.

56
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:59,534
I'm just not hungry today,
but I don't want my lunch to go to waste.

57
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:02,371
- Maybe you'd eat it for me?
- I'd like to help you, Miss Davis.

58
00:07:02,477 --> 00:07:04,877
Thank you, Clara.

59
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:10,216
I'll be stepping out
for a few minutes.

60
00:07:10,318 --> 00:07:12,548
Charlotte will be in charge
while I'm gone...

61
00:07:12,654 --> 00:07:16,283
and she'll report to me the names of anyone
breaking any class rules in my absence.

62
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:18,985
Anyone.

63
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:30,562
<i>I got it level.</i>

64
00:07:56,197 --> 00:08:00,327
Give the men a break for lunch.
I'll be back.

65
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:05,304
You're the boss.
All right, that's lunch.

66
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:16,447
Is this a private lunch
or can anyone dine here?

67
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:19,315
I hope I didn't startle you.

68
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:21,355
No.

69
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:23,481
I'm Grant Thomas.

70
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:25,786
Missie Davis.

71
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:27,828
Well, Missie Davis...

72
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:30,727
I have surveyed hundreds of miles of land
west of the Mississippi...

73
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:33,630
but today is the first time
I've ever seen anything as pretty as you...

74
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:35,635
in the viewfinder
of my transit.

75
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:38,228
I was picking berries.

76
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,867
Not a very substantial midday meal,
if you don't mind my saying so.

77
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:44,945
Did you say you have a transit?

78
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:47,037
Yes. It's a device used to
measure the...

79
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:49,878
<i>Horizontal and vertical
angles of the land.</i>

80
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:52,885
- That's right.
- And you have one close by?

81
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:54,716
Would you like to see?

82
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:10,734
- Would you like to look?
- Mm-hmm.

83
00:09:12,774 --> 00:09:15,902
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

84
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:26,545
- That's amazing.
- Hmm.

85
00:09:26,654 --> 00:09:29,953
What are you all doing here?

86
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:32,356
Follow me.

87
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:43,701
We work for the Continental Railroad Company.
It's our job to survey the lines...

88
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:48,469
to find the best and shortest routes
for the men who lay the tracks.

89
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:52,137
That's a Vernier solar compass.
It shows us which direction is true north.

90
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:55,216
I've read about equipment
like this.

91
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:57,716
I know you said
you're not hungry, but...

92
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:00,947
<i>maybe you'd consider
joining me for lunch.</i>

93
00:10:01,055 --> 00:10:04,752
I'm sorry.
I really have to go. I'm late.

94
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,383
Late?

95
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:10,296
Thanks.

96
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:20,129
- Are you sure you have to go?
- I'm afraid so.

97
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:23,733
But it was nice to meet you,
and good luck with all your work here.

98
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:35,785
Let me in.

99
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,757
<i>Let me in.</i>

100
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:43,256
I know you're responsible for this,
Brian Murphy.

101
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:48,859
Get off this door.
I'm giving you one last chance.

102
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,599
Fine, have it your way.
I'm leaving and coming back with your pa.

103
00:10:56,044 --> 00:11:00,481
I'm sorry. I assure you it isn't my desire
to startle you every time we meet.

104
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:05,281
No. It's fine.
I was just about to go in and teach a class.

105
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:08,956
I'm the teacher.

106
00:11:09,057 --> 00:11:11,787
Well, I don't mean to hold you up,
but you left this.

107
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:14,020
Thank you.

108
00:11:14,128 --> 00:11:17,586
I understand now why you couldn't
accept my invitation for lunch.

109
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:22,136
So maybe you'll accept my next invitation
to dine with me for lunch?

110
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:25,695
<i>A week from Saturday?
It's not a school day.</i>

111
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:29,004
- Unless you have a steady beau.
- No.

112
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,570
- No, you won't dine with me?
- No. I mean, no, I don't have a steady beau.

113
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:37,583
- Oh.
- Yes. I would be delighted to dine with you.

114
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:41,143
Wonderful. I hear the hotel dining room
has the best food in town.

115
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:43,156
I could arrange
for transportation.

116
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:45,522
Oh, no. That's all right.
I'll meet you there.

117
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:51,091
- Around noon?
- Noon would be perfect.

118
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:55,360
Better get back to my class.

119
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,372
All right. Good-bye.

120
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:03,674
Good-bye.

121
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:19,019
<i>And this handsome and mysterious stranger
rides up on this mighty steed...</i>

122
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,425
and sweeps me off my feet.

123
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:24,157
- Missie Davis, you are making that up.
- I'm not.

124
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:27,894
It really happened. His name's Grant Thomas,
and he works for the railroad.

125
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:32,302
- On the crew?
- Yes, but he's different from the other men.

126
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:36,707
I mean, he was well-dressed
and self-assured.

127
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:38,711
They treat him
like he was the boss.

128
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:40,713
He even had his own tent
filled with food.

129
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:44,114
Looks like you're imagining
a little more than just food.

130
00:12:44,218 --> 00:12:47,449
He invited me
to dine with him at the hotel.

131
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:49,819
- He said "dine"?
- Yes.

132
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:52,119
- What'd you say?
- I said yes.

133
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:04,330
Pa, when you gonna let me do
the choppin' and you do the loadin'?

134
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:08,960
- When you get older.
- That's what you said about the plowin'.

135
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,530
Well, that's right. You're gonna be
a big help with the plowin' someday.

136
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:17,509
- But I wanna help now.
- You are helping me.

137
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:22,481
But I wanna do important work.
A man's work.

138
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,848
There's all kinds of work, Son.

139
00:14:27,722 --> 00:14:29,690
There's a boy's work.

140
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:35,822
There's a man's work,
and there's God's work.

141
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,830
It's all important.

142
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:41,197
- So feeding the chickens is important?
- Yep.

143
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:43,862
- And cleaning the pig's pen?
- Oh, you bet.

144
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:45,905
Um, Pa, I gotta go.

145
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:52,711
- Go ahead.
- Be right back, Pa. Be right back to help.

146
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:55,715
Okay.

147
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:58,752
Whew.

148
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,034
Aaron.

149
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:19,537
Aaron, are you hurt?

150
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,904
Seen 'em trapped
lots of times, Pa...

151
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:25,877
but I ain't never heard
one do that till now.

152
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:39,588
<i>It scared me so bad, Pa.
I don't need to pee no more.</i>

153
00:15:49,704 --> 00:15:51,638
You all right, Pa?

154
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:54,640
Come here.

155
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:58,502
<i>Listen to me, Son.</i>

156
00:15:58,613 --> 00:16:01,241
I need you to take off your belt...

157
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:05,786
I need you to take off your belt
and wrap it around my leg.

158
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:12,690
Oh. Come on.

159
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:18,691
There you go.

160
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,995
What do I do again, Pa?

161
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:24,503
Wrap it around
above my knee. Tight.

162
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:28,666
Pa, help me. I don't know what to do.

163
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:32,212
It's not your fault.

164
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:36,380
Pa.

165
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,554
<i>Pa.! Pa.!</i>

166
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,220
Please, Pa.

167
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:52,629
Don't leave me.

168
00:16:55,736 --> 00:16:58,466
Please, Pa.

169
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:20,227
<i>Hyah.! Hyah.!</i>

170
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,608
Hyah.

171
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:48,387
Hyah.

172
00:17:50,224 --> 00:17:53,022
Whoa. Whoa.

173
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:04,937
Hello.

174
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:13,711
<i>Who are you?</i>

175
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:15,782
Hyah.

176
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:23,916
<i>Help him, Missie.</i>

177
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:29,657
Oh, my God. Ma-Mama!

178
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,600
- Mama!
- What?

179
00:18:34,702 --> 00:18:36,670
Come quick.

180
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:41,606
Oh, God. Oh, God.

181
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,838
The bleeding has stopped for now.

182
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:53,751
No moving around, Clark.
Uh-uh.

183
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,923
Need to give that wound
a chance to heal.

184
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:06,295
- For how long?
- At least a few weeks. Maybe more.

185
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,667
<i>That's a serious injury.
Gash goes clear to the bone.</i>

186
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:15,165
I'll see you out.

187
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:17,540
Thanks, Doc.

188
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:24,347
- How's Pa?
- He's resting.

189
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:28,955
Thank you
for coming so quickly.

190
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:31,820
It takes me a better part
of a month to do my rounds...

191
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:34,656
<i>but I'll be back
to check on him then.</i>

192
00:19:34,762 --> 00:19:36,730
I'll make sure
he stays in bed.

193
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,857
Infection.
That's your biggest worry now.

194
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:43,528
<i>A bad infection
could lead to gangrene.</i>

195
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:45,628
He could lose his leg.

196
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:49,868
Or worse.

197
00:20:10,765 --> 00:20:15,225
Dear Lord,
you've healed the lame.

198
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:17,497
Please.

199
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:20,438
Please help this good man.

200
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,509
Give us the strength
to endure this.

201
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:28,412
He will.

202
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:31,246
He will.

203
00:20:31,352 --> 00:20:35,516
That look of worry on your face,
it hurts a lot more than this leg does.

204
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:37,591
I'm fine.

205
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:40,592
I'm right here.

206
00:20:40,694 --> 00:20:43,458
I know, but...

207
00:20:43,564 --> 00:20:46,727
I'm right here, Marty.
I'm not going anywhere.

208
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:54,196
And I'm figuring that, uh...

209
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:57,368
A couple of days,
I'm gonna be right as rain.

210
00:20:59,914 --> 00:21:01,814
You can't work the fields, Clark.

211
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:05,408
I have to.

212
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,320
<i>If we don't get a good crop this year,
we're gonna lose everything.</i>

213
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:14,053
I know.

214
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:16,595
That's why Missie and I
will do it.

215
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:20,930
You can't.

216
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:23,230
We will.

217
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:54,025
<i>Shh.</i>

218
00:21:55,302 --> 00:21:57,600
Pa's asleep.

219
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,474
Go on and eat your lunch.

220
00:22:01,575 --> 00:22:06,035
- I wanna stay here with Pa.
- I'll be right here with him.

221
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:08,615
Pa needs me.

222
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:55,761
Whoa.

223
00:24:25,386 --> 00:24:28,184
- Thank you.
- Here you go, sir.

224
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,417
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
- Looks good.

225
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,842
Whoa.

226
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:15,962
Lunchtime.

227
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:23,068
Oh, no. Saturday.

228
00:25:50,003 --> 00:25:52,267
What is it?
What's wrong?

229
00:25:52,373 --> 00:25:57,003
I'm just redressing the wound.
Can you hand me that canister of yeast?

230
00:26:02,483 --> 00:26:04,348
Elm bark and yeast?

231
00:26:26,407 --> 00:26:31,208
This should make it all better.

232
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:33,438
And if it doesn't?

233
00:26:54,468 --> 00:26:58,097
Oh, God. Please, God.
Help my pa.

234
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:18,216
Whoa. Whoa.

235
00:27:28,435 --> 00:27:32,804
Afternoon.
I think this belongs to you.

236
00:27:34,675 --> 00:27:37,041
You're the man
that helped bring my pa home.

237
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:40,045
How is he?

238
00:27:40,147 --> 00:27:43,776
He's alive.

239
00:27:43,884 --> 00:27:45,852
How did you
happen upon him?

240
00:27:45,953 --> 00:27:49,980
I was out checking my traps.

241
00:27:52,526 --> 00:27:55,654
What do you think
you're doing?

242
00:27:55,762 --> 00:27:58,697
I thought I might
have a turn at the plow.

243
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,895
Why are you helping me?

244
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:04,903
Well, wait a minute.
What's your name?

245
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:07,565
Nate.

246
00:28:07,674 --> 00:28:10,040
I thought maybe
we'd met before.

247
00:28:10,143 --> 00:28:12,043
I don't think so.

248
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:26,719
Got, uh, Anders and Malone working
on the next quarter-mile like you asked.

249
00:28:26,827 --> 00:28:29,990
I'm glad someone
is where they're supposed to be.

250
00:28:30,097 --> 00:28:32,065
Yeah. I know it's
none of my business, boss...

251
00:28:32,165 --> 00:28:35,191
but maybe the lady had a good reason
for standing you up.

252
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:55,384
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

253
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,887
- So, you've handled a plow before.
- Yep.

254
00:29:03,997 --> 00:29:07,023
Are you from around here?

255
00:29:09,236 --> 00:29:12,467
- Here and there.
- Just passing through?

256
00:29:12,573 --> 00:29:15,565
You always ask
so many questions?

257
00:29:15,676 --> 00:29:18,076
Just wondering
on your work experience.

258
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:21,978
'Cause it seems to me you should be
spacing the rows a little closer together.

259
00:29:22,082 --> 00:29:25,711
Because the more rows you plow, the more seeds
I can plant and the bigger the harvest is.

260
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:29,448
Do I tell you how to
braid your hair?

261
00:29:29,556 --> 00:29:31,820
Don't tell me
how to plow a field.

262
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:51,769
How is he, ma'am?

263
00:30:06,693 --> 00:30:09,992
Mind if I take a look?

264
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:15,168
There's some water in the bowl.
Missie, could you...

265
00:30:28,548 --> 00:30:30,516
Best if your boy
wasn't in here.

266
00:30:30,617 --> 00:30:33,814
Aaron, Pa needs fresh water.

267
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,651
- Missie can.
- No, I want you to get it.

268
00:30:37,758 --> 00:30:41,626
No, Mama.
I'm not leaving Pa.

269
00:30:41,728 --> 00:30:44,526
Pa will be all right.
We're here to see to that.

270
00:30:44,631 --> 00:30:46,656
- Right now I want you to...
- I'm not going! No!

271
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:48,667
- Aaron.
- No.

272
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:51,738
<i>- Go and get fresh water.
- I'm not leaving.</i>

273
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:53,567
<i>- Pa needs me.!
- Hand me that chair.</i>

274
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:57,166
<i>Let me in.!</i>

275
00:30:57,277 --> 00:31:01,145
<i>He needs me in there, Mama.
Let me in.</i>

276
00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:04,411
<i>Please, let me in.</i>

277
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:07,146
What didn't you want him
to hear?

278
00:31:07,254 --> 00:31:10,553
We're gonna have to open that wound
and burn it clean.

279
00:31:10,657 --> 00:31:12,557
It's the only way
to get rid of the infection.

280
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:16,220
<i>- I thought the elm bark would help dry it out.
- Mama, please.</i>

281
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:19,628
<i>He'll lose his leg...</i>

282
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:22,201
or his life if you let
the infection get worse.

283
00:31:22,302 --> 00:31:26,432
<i>No. You're not touching my pa.</i>

284
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,499
Have you ever done
this sort of thing before?

285
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:35,570
Been a ranch hand for years.
Seen a lot of mishaps.

286
00:31:35,682 --> 00:31:37,946
So I've taken care
of my share of accidents.

287
00:31:40,153 --> 00:31:44,351
Mama. Can't we just
wait for Doc?

288
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:47,859
The doc won't be around
for another three weeks.

289
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:57,128
What do you need?

290
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:04,473
Take my knife and clean it
with whatever you got. Brandy or iodine.

291
00:32:04,578 --> 00:32:06,876
I'm gonna need
some hot coals and a fry pan.

292
00:32:17,424 --> 00:32:21,155
Be best if you took
your brothers out of earshot.

293
00:32:28,201 --> 00:32:30,567
I love you, Pa.

294
00:33:27,127 --> 00:33:29,391
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

295
00:33:48,949 --> 00:33:51,247
Appreciate it.

296
00:34:20,814 --> 00:34:24,113
The fever broke.
He's awake.

297
00:34:24,217 --> 00:34:26,515
He's even hungry.
He's asking for my fried chicken.

298
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:42,361
<i>Make sure you thank him
and invite him for supper tonight.</i>

299
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,768
I will. Nate.

300
00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:50,972
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa.

301
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,209
Thank you... for everything.

302
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,821
Just glad I was there.

303
00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:05,551
Especially wouldn't wantin'
your brother watching his pa die...

304
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:08,753
then living a life wondering
what he could've done different.

305
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,528
Well, I hope you like fried chicken.

306
00:35:12,632 --> 00:35:15,760
That's what
we're having for supper.

307
00:35:23,777 --> 00:35:27,736
<i>I'm hungry.
You hear my stomach growl here?</i>

308
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:29,974
<i>We're all hungry.
We've been waiting all day.</i>

309
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:32,711
<i>So who cooked this fine feast anyway?</i>

310
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:34,946
<i>- Who do you think cooked it?
- Come on. Who cooked it?</i>

311
00:35:35,055 --> 00:35:39,014
<i>- I cooked it of course.
- Who put the on this chicken?</i>

312
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:42,288
<i>- The what?
- It's my favorite.</i>

313
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:47,798
He's here.
Can we start eating?

314
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:49,801
- Patience.
- Nate, come on in.

315
00:35:49,903 --> 00:35:52,337
<i>We're having a picnic.
We made you a plate.</i>

316
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:55,237
Pa's leg is getting better, Nate.

317
00:35:55,342 --> 00:35:59,369
And I'll be right here to make sure
you have everything you need, Pa.

318
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:04,507
<i>Like if you need water... or biscuits.
Or someone to get you a piece of ham.</i>

319
00:36:04,617 --> 00:36:09,953
<i>- Or your Bible.
- How 'bout you get me some help with the chores?</i>

320
00:36:10,056 --> 00:36:14,018
- Pa needs me.
- All right, you two. Let's say the blessing...

321
00:36:14,127 --> 00:36:18,587
so we can eat this fine meal
that your mama has prepared.

322
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:24,330
<i>Lord, we thank you for the blessings
that you've bestowed on this family.</i>

323
00:36:24,437 --> 00:36:27,736
My family. And to Nate...

324
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:31,299
<i>our very own miracle...</i>

325
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:34,346
<i>who has reopened our eyes
to your enduring promise.</i>

326
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:37,007
- Amen.
- Amen.

327
00:36:37,117 --> 00:36:39,017
- Eat up.
- All right.

328
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,246
Oh.

329
00:36:41,354 --> 00:36:44,585
Marty tells me that you've done
more work in that field today...

330
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:46,818
<i>than she and Missie
have been able to do all week.</i>

331
00:36:48,862 --> 00:36:51,660
Well, it wasn't
my first time behind a plow.

332
00:36:51,765 --> 00:36:53,756
You got your own
piece of land?

333
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:59,567
Uh, no. No land yet.
Just plans.

334
00:36:59,672 --> 00:37:03,108
Never despise meager beginnings.

335
00:37:08,281 --> 00:37:12,240
Got some wheat and corn...

336
00:37:12,352 --> 00:37:16,982
needs to get in the ground...
next couple of weeks.

337
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,082
I'll pay you fair price
soon as the crop comes in.

338
00:37:20,193 --> 00:37:22,093
<i>But Missie here,
she's young and able...</i>

339
00:37:22,195 --> 00:37:26,962
<i>and I'm sure she'd be happy to
help you with the planting.</i>

340
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:35,736
I'll be out there at sunup.

341
00:37:35,842 --> 00:37:37,707
All right.

342
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,218
<i>Do a bunny.</i>

343
00:37:48,254 --> 00:37:52,884
<i>- He has a big mouth.
- You better watch out. He might get ya.</i>

344
00:37:56,996 --> 00:38:00,124
What I won't give
for a handful of quiet.

345
00:38:00,233 --> 00:38:04,431
<i>Do a swan.</i>

346
00:38:12,245 --> 00:38:14,941
Do a bear.

347
00:38:15,048 --> 00:38:18,677
<i>- He has a big mouth.
- Better watch out. He might get ya!</i>

348
00:38:50,884 --> 00:38:52,818
Cut your hair for two bits.

349
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:56,047
Actually, I'm not here for a haircut.
I just need a little information.

350
00:38:56,156 --> 00:38:58,215
Information's two bits.

351
00:39:00,927 --> 00:39:03,327
I'm looking for a young woman...
a Missie Davis.

352
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:05,226
I can tell you just where
to find the Davis place.

353
00:39:05,331 --> 00:39:07,561
I'd be most appreciative.

354
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:11,535
You wanna head back out of town.
Go south from the post office.

355
00:39:11,638 --> 00:39:15,096
- Get to two big oak trees. Head west.
- Head west.

356
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,802
- You can't miss it.
- Thank you very much.

357
00:39:17,911 --> 00:39:20,539
Sometimes when
I'm outside like this...

358
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:23,445
surrounded by all this beauty...

359
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,917
it feels like I'm walking through
one of God's paintings.

360
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,250
Feeds my soul.

361
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:32,750
Speaking of God...

362
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:36,659
what did your Pa mean by
"His enduring promise"?

363
00:39:36,763 --> 00:39:40,358
That someday
he'll wipe away all our tears...

364
00:39:40,466 --> 00:39:46,200
<i>and that all pain and suffering
and heartache will be gone.</i>

365
00:39:46,306 --> 00:39:49,275
That evening when
we were all together...

366
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:53,175
feeling joyful that Pa
wasn't in pain...

367
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:56,180
you helped give us
a glimpse of that promise.

368
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:14,432
We have plenty of wood
back at the cabin.

369
00:40:14,534 --> 00:40:17,594
Not a sturdy piece of oak
like this one.

370
00:40:17,704 --> 00:40:20,172
What's it for?

371
00:40:23,009 --> 00:40:27,105
<i>None of your beeswax.</i>

372
00:40:31,651 --> 00:40:34,211
Are you all right?

373
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:46,257
Crazy.

374
00:40:51,204 --> 00:40:53,069
You're foolish
to mess with bees.

375
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:56,141
I've done this
plenty of times.

376
00:40:56,242 --> 00:40:58,142
Smoke puts 'em to sleep.

377
00:41:00,947 --> 00:41:03,313
We'll surprise your mama
with some honey.

378
00:41:09,255 --> 00:41:11,450
Ouch. Hey, ouch!

379
00:41:11,557 --> 00:41:14,583
What's the matter?
One of the bees not sleepy?

380
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:26,671
What about the honey for Mama?

381
00:41:26,773 --> 00:41:31,437
I'd, uh, stop talking
and start running if I were you.

382
00:41:33,479 --> 00:41:36,778
Oh.

383
00:41:46,392 --> 00:41:50,226
Come here.

384
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:05,174
That was close.

385
00:42:05,278 --> 00:42:08,247
Smoke puts 'em to sleep.

386
00:42:08,348 --> 00:42:13,149
- It's always worked before.
- Well, throwing a rock at 'em didn't help either.

387
00:42:17,023 --> 00:42:19,651
No. Oh, no.

388
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:22,319
- What is it?
- My locket.

389
00:42:23,696 --> 00:42:25,891
- It's gone... It can't be gone.
- Missie.

390
00:42:31,704 --> 00:42:34,229
My mama gave it to me.

391
00:42:42,448 --> 00:42:44,746
Come on.

392
00:42:52,225 --> 00:42:54,716
I can't believe it.

393
00:42:56,729 --> 00:42:58,697
Someone you know?

394
00:43:00,066 --> 00:43:03,035
Someone I never thought
I'd see again.

395
00:43:10,877 --> 00:43:13,505
Good afternoon, Missie.

396
00:43:14,981 --> 00:43:17,575
Good afternoon, Grant.

397
00:43:17,683 --> 00:43:20,083
I was worried when you didn't
show up at the restaurant.

398
00:43:20,186 --> 00:43:22,654
<i>It took every bit of
my surveying equipment to find you.</i>

399
00:43:22,755 --> 00:43:26,714
<i>Actually, I hope you don't mind, but I took
the liberty of asking around in town.</i>

400
00:43:26,826 --> 00:43:31,126
I had planned to be there.
My pa had an accident and was quite ill.

401
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,688
- Is he all right?
- He's still recovering...

402
00:43:34,801 --> 00:43:36,894
but I think the worst
is behind him.

403
00:43:37,003 --> 00:43:39,369
Well, I'm so glad.

404
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:46,140
This is Nate. He's been working
for my pa since his accident.

405
00:43:46,245 --> 00:43:49,078
<i>This is Grant Thomas.</i>

406
00:43:49,182 --> 00:43:54,484
<i>We had a mishap with some bees.
I'm a mess.</i>

407
00:43:54,587 --> 00:43:57,579
A beautiful mess.
If you don't mind my saying so.

408
00:43:59,292 --> 00:44:01,988
Would you like to meet my folks?
I mean, my pa might be sleeping, but...

409
00:44:02,094 --> 00:44:04,722
Well, I don't wanna disturb them
with this unannounced visit.

410
00:44:04,831 --> 00:44:08,699
But if it's all right, I'd like to come back and
do things the right and proper way.

411
00:44:08,801 --> 00:44:11,429
- Things?
- Yes.

412
00:44:11,537 --> 00:44:14,973
I'd like to ask his permission to court
his daughter, if that's all right with you?

413
00:44:15,074 --> 00:44:19,841
Yes. That would be fine
with me.

414
00:44:19,946 --> 00:44:23,746
Then I'll look forward to my next conversation
with him when he's feeling up to it.

415
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:26,785
It's nice to meet you, Nate.

416
00:44:32,425 --> 00:44:34,120
I'll see you soon.

417
00:44:36,596 --> 00:44:38,894
All right, John.

418
00:45:36,622 --> 00:45:39,022
Mama sent me to get you.
She's got supper ready.

419
00:45:40,726 --> 00:45:43,718
I'm not real hungry.

420
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:47,788
- But thank her for me anyway.
- All right.

421
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,528
- I could bring you something for later.
- No.

422
00:45:52,572 --> 00:45:56,099
But you, uh... you can do
something for me.

423
00:45:57,677 --> 00:46:01,579
Give this to your pa.
He's gonna need it to get around.

424
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,078
A sturdy piece of oak.

425
00:46:08,955 --> 00:46:10,980
I know how much
he'll appreciate it.

426
00:46:12,391 --> 00:46:14,325
Good night.

427
00:46:27,873 --> 00:46:30,501
Whoa. Whoa.

428
00:46:31,744 --> 00:46:33,644
Good to see you up.

429
00:46:33,746 --> 00:46:37,546
I just wanted to thank you
for making this fancy cane for me.

430
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:42,417
- Mighty thoughtful of you.
- I know what a chore it can be to get around at first.

431
00:46:42,521 --> 00:46:45,012
You had some experience
with a bum leg yourself?

432
00:46:45,124 --> 00:46:49,527
My pa.
He needed a cane for months.

433
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,595
Best if I get
the horses brushed and fed.

434
00:46:52,698 --> 00:46:54,461
All right then.

435
00:48:20,953 --> 00:48:23,080
How was your walk?

436
00:48:23,189 --> 00:48:26,454
Felt good to get out for a while.
Thanks to you.

437
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,120
I went back to that spot in the woods
where I had my accident.

438
00:48:30,229 --> 00:48:32,356
Woods are nice and green
this time of year.

439
00:48:32,465 --> 00:48:37,869
Yep. Fella could get lost
in those trees if he wanted to.

440
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,803
<i>Willie.</i>

441
00:48:44,977 --> 00:48:46,911
How long have you known?

442
00:48:47,012 --> 00:48:50,641
Boy does a lot of growing and changing
in his teen years.

443
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:56,052
When you told me about your pa's leg,
well, that kind of confirmed it for me.

444
00:49:00,426 --> 00:49:05,591
My middle name's Nathan.
Nate.

445
00:49:05,698 --> 00:49:10,397
<i>Been using it for years 'cause I thought if
I changed my name I could change my past.</i>

446
00:49:10,503 --> 00:49:12,971
Hmm.

447
00:49:13,072 --> 00:49:15,063
How's that
working out for you, son?

448
00:49:17,276 --> 00:49:22,578
Most days it seems like
the past is breathing down my neck...

449
00:49:22,681 --> 00:49:25,309
reminding me I'm Willie.

450
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:28,875
<i>Even in a roomful of folks
who call me Nate.</i>

451
00:49:28,988 --> 00:49:31,513
Your family
had a lot to deal with...

452
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,524
and it must've been awful hard.

453
00:49:39,398 --> 00:49:41,491
When a tragedy...

454
00:49:43,202 --> 00:49:46,000
happens...

455
00:49:46,105 --> 00:49:48,096
a real family pulls together.

456
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:50,675
I mean, mine ripped apart.

457
00:49:53,479 --> 00:49:57,438
My ma, she...

458
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:01,680
grieved herself crazy,
and she went back East.

459
00:50:02,988 --> 00:50:07,618
My pa, he just quit.
So I left home six years ago.

460
00:50:09,662 --> 00:50:13,223
I imagine you got your reasons
for coming back now.

461
00:50:13,332 --> 00:50:16,301
I got some things
that need to be said.

462
00:50:19,672 --> 00:50:24,132
Then I came close to going home,
and I couldn't face my pa.

463
00:50:28,013 --> 00:50:30,641
Not after I left like I did.

464
00:50:30,749 --> 00:50:35,379
And then you found...
Aaron and me.

465
00:50:37,256 --> 00:50:40,089
Yes, you did.

466
00:50:40,192 --> 00:50:43,650
<i>I saw your pa today, son.</i>

467
00:50:43,762 --> 00:50:48,222
I don't know what happened
between you two.

468
00:50:48,334 --> 00:50:52,202
I do know you're never going to step out of
the shadow of your past until you see him.

469
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:06,448
Did you...
Did you tell him about me?

470
00:51:06,552 --> 00:51:08,747
That's not up to me.

471
00:51:08,854 --> 00:51:11,379
He probably doesn't even
wanna see me.

472
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:16,792
I saw a man
with a face full of regret.

473
00:51:19,498 --> 00:51:23,628
Seeing you.
Talking to you.

474
00:51:23,736 --> 00:51:27,433
That might help him
put his past to rest.

475
00:51:30,809 --> 00:51:33,403
I suppose you think I'm a coward
for running the way I did.

476
00:51:33,512 --> 00:51:37,448
The way a man grieves,
that's a personal thing.

477
00:51:38,817 --> 00:51:41,047
<i>But I do know
there are times...</i>

478
00:51:41,153 --> 00:51:46,614
<i>when a man can be driven
to take a trip in search of answers.</i>

479
00:51:46,725 --> 00:51:49,785
And if that man doesn't find
the answer he's looking for?

480
00:51:49,895 --> 00:51:55,356
Most often we're not looking for answers.
We're in need of comfort.

481
00:51:57,403 --> 00:52:02,534
And for me, the only trip worth taking
is when I kneel to pray.

482
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,311
All the comfort I could ever ask for
is right there.

483
00:52:08,414 --> 00:52:11,042
<i>In God.</i>

484
00:52:13,285 --> 00:52:15,310
You'll be fine, son.

485
00:52:31,937 --> 00:52:35,338
Oh, yes. Of course.

486
00:53:27,426 --> 00:53:29,326
What's your business here?

487
00:53:30,362 --> 00:53:32,489
Pa, it's me, Willie.

488
00:53:44,209 --> 00:53:46,109
Oh, my.

489
00:53:46,211 --> 00:53:49,510
I guess you would be old enough
to have whiskers by now.

490
00:53:49,615 --> 00:53:51,515
Yes, sir.

491
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,888
I'm gonna make some coffee.
You want a cup?

492
00:54:06,532 --> 00:54:09,092
<i>Coffee would be good.</i>

493
00:54:09,201 --> 00:54:11,169
<i>Maybe I'll fix some eggs.</i>

494
00:54:19,545 --> 00:54:22,537
I found your parents to be
very gracious about our lunch together.

495
00:54:22,648 --> 00:54:26,448
Back East, young women must often
be accompanied by a chaperone.

496
00:54:26,552 --> 00:54:29,612
<i>Mothers and sisters are too busy
with their tasks of the day...</i>

497
00:54:29,721 --> 00:54:31,621
to spend time chaperoning.

498
00:54:31,723 --> 00:54:35,454
If you don't mind
my saying so, Mr. Thomas...

499
00:54:35,561 --> 00:54:37,825
<i>the entire town is very happy...</i>

500
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:41,331
<i>that your family's bringing the railroad
right past our doors.</i>

501
00:54:41,433 --> 00:54:43,833
<i>Glad to hear we have the support
of the community.</i>

502
00:54:43,936 --> 00:54:48,839
Oh, um, the cook is preparing that special
chicken dish that you requested.

503
00:54:48,941 --> 00:54:52,138
Well, whenever you're ready
for your first course, just signal me.

504
00:54:52,244 --> 00:54:55,577
- Very good.
- I thought you were a surveyor.

505
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:58,582
I am. When your family
owns the business...

506
00:54:58,684 --> 00:55:01,152
it's only smart to know
every aspect of it.

507
00:55:01,253 --> 00:55:03,278
I hope you find everything
to your satisfaction.

508
00:55:03,388 --> 00:55:06,516
Well, everything's so lovely...

509
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:10,618
the table linens, the crystal,
the beautiful Aubusson china.

510
00:55:10,729 --> 00:55:13,459
- You know the pattern?
- Her Majesty's Filigree.

511
00:55:13,565 --> 00:55:16,966
See, the scroll designs along the rim
give it elegance...

512
00:55:17,069 --> 00:55:19,333
and the raised accents
make it unique.

513
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,765
I spend an exorbitant
amount of time reading.

514
00:55:23,876 --> 00:55:26,538
Hey! Hey!

515
00:55:26,645 --> 00:55:30,843
<i>- I believe that's our lunch.
- Pardon. Sorry, sir.</i>

516
00:55:33,819 --> 00:55:35,719
Excuse me.

517
00:55:35,821 --> 00:55:38,153
I'm terribly sorry.

518
00:55:39,825 --> 00:55:43,283
Here you go, sir.

519
00:55:43,395 --> 00:55:45,693
<i>Thank you.</i>

520
00:55:50,802 --> 00:55:54,067
- A connoisseur of knowledge
and a chicken-wrangler.

521
00:55:54,173 --> 00:55:57,734
The advantage of being raised in the West
and educated by a woman from the East.

522
00:55:58,944 --> 00:56:03,244
Um, my mother died
when I was just a child...

523
00:56:03,348 --> 00:56:07,250
and my father ended up
marrying a woman from the East.

524
00:56:09,121 --> 00:56:11,715
Oh, no!
Oh, I'm so clumsy.

525
00:56:11,823 --> 00:56:14,553
No, no. Not at all.
Missie. No, Missie.

526
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,060
- I know they're expensive. I can pay him back.
- Missie. Missie.

527
00:56:17,162 --> 00:56:20,393
The crystal is mine...
as are the plates.

528
00:56:20,499 --> 00:56:23,730
They are easily replaced.
Now sit.

529
00:56:23,835 --> 00:56:28,033
- They're yours?
- I wanted the table to be perfect...

530
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,335
so I had my man, John,
bring them over this morning.

531
00:56:30,442 --> 00:56:34,378
Don't worry another moment. I have 20 more
crystal glasses just like that one at home.

532
00:56:34,479 --> 00:56:36,777
<i>- Twenty more.
- Yes.</i>

533
00:56:36,882 --> 00:56:39,544
And I would happily let you
crack each and every one...

534
00:56:39,651 --> 00:56:41,642
<i>if you'll dine with me
20 more times.</i>

535
00:56:43,388 --> 00:56:45,913
Maybe next time we'll have
to have a picnic instead.

536
00:56:46,024 --> 00:56:48,083
You can leave
all your crystal at home.

537
00:56:48,193 --> 00:56:50,423
I'm already
planning the menu.

538
00:56:56,134 --> 00:56:59,900
This is potatoes
with scrambled eggs.

539
00:57:00,005 --> 00:57:02,371
Just like you always
used to have.

540
00:57:02,474 --> 00:57:05,068
Oh, that wasn't me.
That was Matt...

541
00:57:05,177 --> 00:57:08,078
Mattie.

542
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,444
I hate to waste good food.

543
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:12,779
You know, Pa,
I could probably eat some of this.

544
00:57:12,884 --> 00:57:14,875
Just don't do me
any favors, Willie.

545
00:57:14,987 --> 00:57:18,115
It ain't gonna break my heart
if you don't eat the eggs.

546
00:57:18,223 --> 00:57:20,657
Really, Pa,
I could eat some of that.

547
00:57:20,759 --> 00:57:24,354
Well, you're gonna
eat nothin' now.

548
00:57:24,463 --> 00:57:27,023
I mean, six years since
I seen or heard from you.

549
00:57:27,132 --> 00:57:29,896
I guess I'm entitled
to forget a few things.

550
00:57:30,002 --> 00:57:31,902
Oh, Pa.

551
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:36,098
I'm sorry I left like I did.

552
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:39,666
Well, at least your ma
had the guts...

553
00:57:39,778 --> 00:57:42,008
to tell me to my face
she was leavin'.

554
00:57:44,883 --> 00:57:48,148
- You know what happened to her?
- No.

555
00:57:50,055 --> 00:57:52,489
Then I guess
you're a lot like your mama.

556
00:57:55,627 --> 00:57:58,755
Well, I'm here now.

557
00:57:58,864 --> 00:58:01,492
I came back
to set things right.

558
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,001
- I hope you could...
- What can I do? I could pretend none of this ever happened?

559
00:58:05,103 --> 00:58:07,071
I'm not asking you
to pretend nothin', Pa.

560
00:58:07,172 --> 00:58:10,198
- I'm asking you to forgive me.
- You want me to forgive you?

561
00:58:17,449 --> 00:58:20,441
Maybe you should forget
you still have a son.

562
00:58:58,156 --> 00:59:02,217
- Yes. We'll take three of those, okay?
- Yes.

563
00:59:02,327 --> 00:59:04,227
Yes, please.

564
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,566
That will be fine.

565
00:59:14,373 --> 00:59:16,967
We'll try these ones.

566
00:59:19,945 --> 00:59:22,379
<i>My goodness.</i>

567
00:59:22,481 --> 00:59:26,417
You make him sound like a fictional hero
from one of your novels.

568
00:59:26,518 --> 00:59:31,387
<i>Grant is educated...
and handsome...</i>

569
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,458
attentive.

570
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,060
He's traveled all over
for his job...

571
00:59:37,162 --> 00:59:39,653
and seen places
I've only read about.

572
00:59:39,765 --> 00:59:42,290
Just remember...

573
00:59:42,401 --> 00:59:45,097
that God has written
his own story for you.

574
00:59:45,203 --> 00:59:48,172
And it's not the feelings of your heart
that it should be based upon...

575
00:59:48,273 --> 00:59:52,539
but... rather the thoughts of your heart
that you need to hear...

576
00:59:52,644 --> 00:59:55,579
that inner voice
that tells you...

577
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,046
that this man will care for you
no matter what...

578
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:01,916
that he'll still want to kiss you
when you're old and gray...

579
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:06,389
tend to you when you're sick,
honor you.

580
01:00:06,491 --> 01:00:11,053
And if the thoughts of my heart say yes,
he is the one?

581
01:00:13,932 --> 01:00:17,060
Then you should trust your instincts
and pledge your heart to him...

582
01:00:17,169 --> 01:00:19,637
because a man like that
is as rare as a diamond in the rough.

583
01:00:19,738 --> 01:00:21,899
Like Pa.

584
01:00:22,007 --> 01:00:25,602
Yes. Like your pa.

585
01:00:30,515 --> 01:00:33,279
Aaron said he saw you
packin' up your horse.

586
01:00:33,385 --> 01:00:35,285
You plannin'
on goin' somewhere?

587
01:00:35,387 --> 01:00:38,720
Took your advice.
I saw my pa.

588
01:00:38,824 --> 01:00:40,792
I figured
that's where you were.

589
01:00:45,363 --> 01:00:47,263
According to him,
I ruined his life.

590
01:00:47,365 --> 01:00:51,392
I'm sorry that it didn't work out
the way you hoped, Willie.

591
01:00:53,472 --> 01:00:56,498
I really thought your father was ready
to make amends with you.

592
01:00:58,276 --> 01:01:00,801
He'll never be ready
to do that.

593
01:01:00,912 --> 01:01:03,506
He'll never forgive me.

594
01:01:06,084 --> 01:01:08,518
You're his son.

595
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:10,713
Not anymore.

596
01:01:10,822 --> 01:01:12,813
You wanna talk about it?

597
01:01:12,924 --> 01:01:16,416
Talkin' about it
don't change anything.

598
01:01:19,064 --> 01:01:22,192
Sometimes,
just talkin' it through...

599
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:25,599
it'll help you see things
in a whole different light.

600
01:01:29,241 --> 01:01:31,709
There ain't no light in the world
that'd make this better.

601
01:01:36,481 --> 01:01:40,178
Can't hurt to try.

602
01:01:40,285 --> 01:01:43,743
Unless you're afraid.

603
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,692
I used to set traps for Pa.

604
01:01:53,565 --> 01:01:56,762
Mattie was always after me
to let him come along.

605
01:01:58,503 --> 01:02:01,529
I didn't want him to.
I just figured he'd slow me down.

606
01:02:03,808 --> 01:02:05,935
I didn't want him to.

607
01:02:06,044 --> 01:02:08,012
I just figured
he'd get in the way.

608
01:02:11,449 --> 01:02:13,417
But Mattie had a way
about him.

609
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:18,583
He knew just how to get Ma and Pa
to let him have his way.

610
01:02:21,226 --> 01:02:23,558
When are we gonna
set the first trap, Willie?

611
01:02:23,662 --> 01:02:26,153
When I find the right place.

612
01:02:28,934 --> 01:02:32,199
- When are we gonna eat the food Mama sent?
- When we get hungry.

613
01:02:32,304 --> 01:02:34,898
How do you know when
it's the right time for the traps?

614
01:02:35,006 --> 01:02:37,770
Can't you hush up
for just two seconds?

615
01:02:37,876 --> 01:02:40,743
I can't concentrate
with you yammering on and on.

616
01:02:40,845 --> 01:02:44,611
<i>I don't know how I lost track of the day.</i>

617
01:02:44,716 --> 01:02:47,184
<i>Guess I was just so intent...</i>

618
01:02:47,285 --> 01:02:50,277
<i>on gettin' those traps...
set so Pa would know...</i>

619
01:02:50,388 --> 01:02:53,289
<i>what a good trapper
I really was.</i>

620
01:02:53,391 --> 01:02:55,757
<i>Thinkin' back,
I don't know how I couldn't see...</i>

621
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,158
<i>how tired and worried
Mattie was.</i>

622
01:02:58,263 --> 01:03:01,596
I'm cold, and it's getting dark.

623
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,668
Don't you think
we'd better head back?

624
01:03:03,768 --> 01:03:06,202
I got one more trap to set.

625
01:03:07,706 --> 01:03:11,608
Mama's gonna be worried.

626
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:15,339
Hush. Gotta make
this last trap count.

627
01:03:15,447 --> 01:03:18,473
Pa's dependin' on me.

628
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:21,051
<i>It was like a curtain dropped over the sun.</i>

629
01:03:22,687 --> 01:03:25,281
<i>One minute, I could see
where I was goin'...</i>

630
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:27,824
<i>and the next minute
it got so dark...</i>

631
01:03:27,926 --> 01:03:30,520
<i>I couldn't make out
the right way to go.</i>

632
01:03:37,369 --> 01:03:41,169
I'm so sorry, Mattie.
I should have listened to you.

633
01:03:41,272 --> 01:03:44,332
There's no way I can
get us home in the dark.

634
01:03:46,444 --> 01:03:49,777
May-Maybe Pa
will come find us.

635
01:03:49,881 --> 01:03:55,285
Maybe. More than likely,
we'll just have to wait out the night...

636
01:03:55,387 --> 01:03:57,355
set out home at first light.

637
01:03:57,455 --> 01:04:00,356
I'm awful cold, Willie.

638
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,460
Here. Stay close to me,
and I'll...

639
01:04:06,564 --> 01:04:09,795
I'll keep you wa-warm.

640
01:04:09,901 --> 01:04:12,802
Thanks, Willie.

641
01:04:22,213 --> 01:04:24,647
"Thanks, Willie. "

642
01:04:24,749 --> 01:04:28,981
The kid was shiverin' and shaking
in the cold, and he says thanks.

643
01:04:33,158 --> 01:04:35,558
Then what happened?

644
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,628
Then...

645
01:04:39,297 --> 01:04:41,265
Then he, uh...

646
01:04:43,902 --> 01:04:46,370
You know.

647
01:04:46,471 --> 01:04:48,871
I was right.

648
01:04:48,973 --> 01:04:51,840
Talkin' about it
doesn't change anything.

649
01:05:02,253 --> 01:05:04,721
Plowin's about done.

650
01:05:04,823 --> 01:05:06,723
I think it's time I moved on.

651
01:05:06,825 --> 01:05:09,885
- I did what I came for.
- Did you?

652
01:05:11,896 --> 01:05:14,660
Came home, saw my pa.

653
01:05:16,134 --> 01:05:19,729
Are you sure that's who
you really needed to face?

654
01:05:22,307 --> 01:05:25,105
I should be on my way.

655
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:28,543
Our doors will always
be open to you, Willie...

656
01:05:28,646 --> 01:05:30,546
and our prayers
will be with you.

657
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:59,176
Hah.

658
01:06:00,245 --> 01:06:02,145
<i>Hah.</i>

659
01:06:05,683 --> 01:06:07,810
Hah.

660
01:06:10,388 --> 01:06:12,288
Hah.

661
01:07:46,384 --> 01:07:48,352
Mattie, wake up.

662
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:54,720
Come on, Mattie.
Quit foolin'.

663
01:07:56,227 --> 01:07:58,525
Mattie?

664
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:00,791
No. Mattie.

665
01:08:00,899 --> 01:08:02,867
Mattie, come on.

666
01:08:04,068 --> 01:08:06,536
Come on, Mattie.
Wake up. No.

667
01:08:07,672 --> 01:08:10,072
<i>No.! Mattie.!</i>

668
01:08:10,174 --> 01:08:12,699
Mattie!

669
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:15,244
Mattie! No!

670
01:08:16,814 --> 01:08:19,578
Mattie.

671
01:08:19,684 --> 01:08:24,087
No. Mattie.

672
01:08:24,188 --> 01:08:27,282
Mattie.

673
01:08:30,361 --> 01:08:33,387
It was my fault, Mattie.

674
01:08:37,535 --> 01:08:40,299
I was supposed to protect you,
and I didn't.

675
01:08:44,409 --> 01:08:47,139
I didn't want it to happen.

676
01:08:49,948 --> 01:08:52,644
You slipped away,
and I didn't even know.

677
01:08:55,987 --> 01:08:59,081
You were so brave,
and I didn't even get to tell you.

678
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:08,157
I'm sorry, Mattie.

679
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:14,795
Please forgive me.

680
01:09:33,658 --> 01:09:35,819
- After you.
- Thank you.

681
01:09:44,635 --> 01:09:47,001
Grant.

682
01:09:47,105 --> 01:09:49,164
I've never seen anything like it.

683
01:09:49,273 --> 01:09:51,764
It's just like a real home.

684
01:09:53,011 --> 01:09:55,343
It is my home.

685
01:09:55,446 --> 01:09:58,142
The tent goes up
wherever I am.

686
01:09:58,249 --> 01:10:00,217
I don't see any purpose
in depriving myself...

687
01:10:00,318 --> 01:10:02,718
of the comforts
I've become accustomed to.

688
01:10:05,323 --> 01:10:07,223
You travel
with all these books?

689
01:10:07,325 --> 01:10:10,852
Books... and music.

690
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,364
Honor me with a dance.

691
01:10:23,141 --> 01:10:27,510
- You're an excellent partner.
- Thank you. My father taught me.

692
01:10:27,612 --> 01:10:30,638
Missie, I...

693
01:10:30,748 --> 01:10:34,047
I'm not generally a man who thinks much
past the next site I'm working...

694
01:10:34,152 --> 01:10:38,885
but, since we've met, I've found myself
daydreaming about a future with you.

695
01:10:41,225 --> 01:10:43,193
What do you see for us
in your dreams?

696
01:10:43,294 --> 01:10:48,254
Well, I see us traveling
and exploring together.

697
01:10:48,366 --> 01:10:52,632
Midnight picnics under a canopy
of the brightest stars...

698
01:10:52,737 --> 01:10:54,932
or dining in the finest hotels.

699
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:58,406
A life brimming with anything
and everything you could ever want.

700
01:11:01,412 --> 01:11:04,279
That life sounds like
a fairy tale.

701
01:11:06,851 --> 01:11:09,479
That life could be ours.

702
01:11:09,587 --> 01:11:12,249
You would never have to
turn a spade in soil again or...

703
01:11:12,356 --> 01:11:14,722
or toil at planting
your own food.

704
01:11:14,826 --> 01:11:17,420
And if I did have
to plant and plow...

705
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:19,928
do you see yourself
right there beside me?

706
01:11:20,031 --> 01:11:23,159
You're missing my point.
I wouldn't have to be there...

707
01:11:23,267 --> 01:11:25,235
because no wife of mine
would ever struggle...

708
01:11:25,336 --> 01:11:27,133
<i>if even for an hour, in a field.</i>

709
01:11:27,238 --> 01:11:29,331
I'm a very wealthy man.

710
01:11:35,346 --> 01:11:37,246
What's wrong?

711
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:42,481
I just always thought my first kiss
should be for the man I marry.

712
01:11:42,587 --> 01:11:44,782
Then marry me.

713
01:11:47,258 --> 01:11:49,726
Missie, you don't want
to say no to a man...

714
01:11:49,827 --> 01:11:52,125
who's offering to save you
from a life of adversity.

715
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:54,562
I'm saying no to a man
who doesn't think adversity...

716
01:11:54,665 --> 01:11:56,633
is something
to get through together.

717
01:11:56,734 --> 01:12:00,067
It's just not real, Grant.

718
01:12:03,207 --> 01:12:05,141
I'll tell you what's real.

719
01:12:05,243 --> 01:12:08,144
You've just given up
the chance of a lifetime.

720
01:12:08,246 --> 01:12:10,146
I can have any heart I want.

721
01:12:11,249 --> 01:12:13,149
Until now.

722
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:18,120
I'm sorry, Grant.

723
01:12:19,924 --> 01:12:22,552
I'll get someone
to take you home.

724
01:12:30,201 --> 01:12:32,829
God bless you.

725
01:12:32,937 --> 01:12:35,531
Nate. Hi.

726
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:41,237
Actually, I'm Willie...
Nathan LaHaye.

727
01:12:43,247 --> 01:12:46,512
- Willie LaHaye.
- You were the boy...

728
01:12:46,617 --> 01:12:50,144
that stole my hair ribbons
and dipped my braids in ink.

729
01:12:50,254 --> 01:12:52,654
And then when your brother...

730
01:12:56,894 --> 01:12:59,590
And then you were gone.

731
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,200
So, why didn't you tell me
who you were?

732
01:13:08,573 --> 01:13:11,041
I've been Nate for years
to strangers.

733
01:13:11,142 --> 01:13:15,044
Guess I wasn't ready
to be Willie again...

734
01:13:15,146 --> 01:13:17,046
un-until now.

735
01:13:18,349 --> 01:13:22,183
Well, you don't look
like anything I remember.

736
01:13:22,286 --> 01:13:26,017
Oh. I was just a boy
when I left.

737
01:13:26,123 --> 01:13:29,889
It's been a while.
People change.

738
01:13:31,162 --> 01:13:33,130
They do.

739
01:13:37,034 --> 01:13:40,094
Well, how about your Pa?
Have you seen him?

740
01:13:43,241 --> 01:13:45,209
I've seen him...

741
01:13:46,611 --> 01:13:49,375
but he's not ready
to see me.

742
01:13:57,989 --> 01:14:02,085
Well, you know, I wanted to thank you
for all you did for my family...

743
01:14:02,193 --> 01:14:06,425
but you... you left
without saying good-bye.

744
01:14:09,133 --> 01:14:12,762
Had some thinkin' to do,
some things to get right.

745
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,468
<i>I'm grateful to you
and your family...</i>

746
01:14:18,576 --> 01:14:21,136
for helping me
put down a burden...

747
01:14:21,245 --> 01:14:23,145
that I've been carryin'
for a long time.

748
01:14:23,247 --> 01:14:27,377
Actually, I'm...
I'm headed for the West.

749
01:14:32,857 --> 01:14:34,825
You've got land to farm?

750
01:14:34,925 --> 01:14:40,124
No. Not yet.
When I do claim my land...

751
01:14:40,231 --> 01:14:44,600
it'll be for raising cattle,
not crops.

752
01:14:44,702 --> 01:14:48,604
<i>I worked on a couple cattle ranches,
and it's what suits me.</i>

753
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:56,441
The thing is,
I came by today...

754
01:14:56,547 --> 01:14:58,515
because I didn't want
to make the same mistake.

755
01:15:01,152 --> 01:15:04,417
<i>I wanted to see you
and, um...</i>

756
01:15:06,824 --> 01:15:09,725
and give these back to you.

757
01:15:15,766 --> 01:15:18,496
My ribbons.

758
01:15:18,602 --> 01:15:20,661
You kept them all these years?

759
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:24,508
Probably seems silly to you.

760
01:15:24,608 --> 01:15:26,803
No, not silly.

761
01:15:27,945 --> 01:15:30,675
It's sweet.

762
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:33,750
Well, anyway,
that's what I came for...

763
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,844
to give you those and...

764
01:15:38,255 --> 01:15:41,656
to say good-bye.

765
01:15:45,796 --> 01:15:47,696
Bye.

766
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:09,210
Never despise meager beginnings.

767
01:16:13,491 --> 01:16:15,516
Wait!

768
01:16:15,626 --> 01:16:17,526
Willie.

769
01:16:24,268 --> 01:16:27,396
Willie.

770
01:16:34,512 --> 01:16:38,642
I was just wondering
if, um...

771
01:16:38,749 --> 01:16:41,912
Are cattle ranchers tied to the seasons
the same way farmers are?

772
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,112
No, not in the same way,
I suppose.

773
01:16:46,223 --> 01:16:49,920
So, would it make a difference
if you leave now or leave later?

774
01:16:50,027 --> 01:16:52,120
I guess not.

775
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:55,630
After all the work you did
plowing and planting our fields...

776
01:16:55,733 --> 01:16:58,930
<i>it would be a shame for you to miss
the harvest and not collect your pay.</i>

777
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:01,527
And I make really good
corn bread pudding...

778
01:17:01,639 --> 01:17:03,937
once the sweet corn's shucked.

779
01:17:07,645 --> 01:17:10,580
I'll bet that fella Grant Thomas
will really like that.

780
01:17:12,983 --> 01:17:16,009
Yes, I bet he will...

781
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,486
if he finds someone
to make it for him.

782
01:17:20,357 --> 01:17:22,791
It won't be me.

783
01:17:25,262 --> 01:17:29,995
I guess I could postpone my trip
long enough to be here for the harvest.

784
01:17:31,435 --> 01:17:33,403
Good.

785
01:17:58,062 --> 01:18:00,189
They named him Big Earl.

786
01:18:00,297 --> 01:18:02,458
Big Earl, he...

787
01:18:04,502 --> 01:18:07,062
Dear Father, we thank you
for this harvest...

788
01:18:07,171 --> 01:18:09,071
for your faith in us...

789
01:18:09,173 --> 01:18:11,471
<i>and for the time
we spend together.</i>

790
01:18:11,575 --> 01:18:14,567
<i>- Amen.
- Amen.</i>

791
01:18:17,748 --> 01:18:21,240
All right,
pass your bowls down.

792
01:18:30,694 --> 01:18:32,662
You workin' hard?

793
01:18:32,763 --> 01:18:34,663
Tryin' to.

794
01:18:44,608 --> 01:18:47,543
<i>Go again.</i>

795
01:18:51,282 --> 01:18:54,718
All right, you two.
You know what's expected.

796
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:57,378
<i>- Ah.
- Go ahead. Get on up there.</i>

797
01:18:57,488 --> 01:18:59,683
<i>Time's a-wastin', boy.</i>

798
01:19:02,626 --> 01:19:04,287
<i>Ah.!</i>

799
01:19:18,976 --> 01:19:20,534
<i>Look at them two.</i>

800
01:19:45,502 --> 01:19:47,697
I love you, Missie Davis.

801
01:19:49,907 --> 01:19:52,239
I always have.

802
01:19:54,011 --> 01:19:55,911
I love you too.

803
01:19:58,782 --> 01:20:02,274
Missie Davis,
will you marry me?

804
01:20:35,152 --> 01:20:37,120
<i>Happy day.</i>

805
01:22:09,847 --> 01:22:13,214
- Try and send word as soon as you're settled.
- I will.

806
01:22:17,921 --> 01:22:21,379
And walk as much as you can.
It's better than riding.

807
01:22:23,827 --> 01:22:27,160
You know
how much we love you.

808
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:35,630
<i>I know it's not so far,
but send word once you're settled.</i>

809
01:22:41,545 --> 01:22:43,604
I'll take good care of her.

810
01:22:43,714 --> 01:22:45,614
I know you will.

811
01:22:45,716 --> 01:22:48,446
You take good care
of both of you.

812
01:22:57,528 --> 01:22:59,996
Ever since you were
just a little baby...

813
01:23:01,431 --> 01:23:04,400
I knew this moment would come.

814
01:23:04,501 --> 01:23:08,938
You always had
an independent spirit.

815
01:23:10,841 --> 01:23:14,800
Pa. My heart's breaking.

816
01:23:14,912 --> 01:23:17,642
Mine too.

817
01:23:19,082 --> 01:23:23,485
- Can you fix it?
- Not this time, little one.

818
01:23:28,392 --> 01:23:30,690
Not this time.

819
01:23:45,709 --> 01:23:48,610
You go ahead now.

820
01:23:48,712 --> 01:23:51,010
Your husband's waitin' on you.

821
01:24:00,824 --> 01:24:02,724
Thank you.

822
01:24:36,293 --> 01:24:38,454
Remember His promise.

823
01:24:38,562 --> 01:24:41,861
No tears.

824
01:24:41,965 --> 01:24:43,899
No tears.

825
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,664
No tears.
