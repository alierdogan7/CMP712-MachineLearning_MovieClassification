1
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,196
Chick, chick, chick.

2
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,148
Tobe, stop that doggone racket.

3
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,631
<i>Quiet, Tobe.</i>

4
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,551
How far to Lordsburg?

5
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,552
It's about ten miles that way.

6
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,631
Thank you.

7
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,597
Good afternoon, ma'am.

8
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,351
Six sacks of grain.

9
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,436
My horse limps. Take him
over to the smithy and tell him
I'll be along in a few minutes.

10
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,317
Sure.

11
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,880
- Yes, sir? What'll it be?
- I'd like a room.

12
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,157
A room? We don't
get much hotel business...

13
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,549
around here
this time of the year.

14
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,431
Sign right there.

15
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,870
Planning to be around long?

16
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,951
Not long.

17
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,476
That'll be room number seven,
to the right at the top of the stairs.

18
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,154
Oh, that's a buck and a half
in advance.

19
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,075
I'll pay when I leave.

20
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,077
Okay. Forget I mentioned it.

21
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,479
We change sheets
on Friday, Mr. Grant.

22
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,314
The name is Gant. John Gant.

23
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,353
Did I hear right?

24
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,069
- Did he say-
- He said "Gant."

25
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,994
Him? That kid?

26
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,038
That's him. Sid.

27
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,078
<i>- Sid!</i>
- Yes, Mr. Reeger?

28
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,914
- Go tell the sheriff.
- Yes, sir.

29
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,396
Whoa, there, Sid.

30
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,311
Somebody finally catch you
waterin' the whisky?

31
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,356
- Can't stop, Earl. I gotta go!
- What's the rush?

32
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,670
- It's Gant. John Gant. He's here!
- What do ya mean?

33
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,320
He just rode up.
I gotta tell the sheriff.

34
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,876
Gant, here?

35
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,996
What's he want here?

36
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,914
Don't you know?
Same thing he wants anywhere.

37
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,996
Fixed the lock. There wasn't
anything serious wrong with it.

38
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,991
Buck! Oh. Buck!

39
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,548
- He's here. He's right here in town.
- You don't say.

40
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,838
- Who's that, Sid?
- Gant! John Gant.
He just took a room at the hotel.

41
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,434
- He just get in?
- Just this minute.

42
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,876
- Well.
- "Well"? Is that all?

43
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,190
- You want me to cheer?
- Who's John Gant, Buck?

44
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,192
Well, you've got to do something
about it! Mr. Reeger said-

45
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,114
I don't care what Mr. Reeger said!
There's nothing I can do.

46
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,556
- Well, if you can't, who can?
- Who's he talkin' about?

47
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,835
- You mean you really don't know?
- I asked, didn't I?

48
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,832
- He's a killer.
- So what? We've had
some pretty good ones.

49
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,070
- We've been able to handle them.
- No, no.

50
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,118
A gunman is one thing.
Gant's another.

51
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,760
Why, he's killed 20 or 30 men.
For money!

52
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,718
He just goes into a town and kills 'em!
Like that.

53
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,837
- He's a- Well, an assassin.
- How come he's still loose?

54
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,639
He prods them into it.
You know as well as I do.

55
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,632
You can make any man fight
if you try hard enough.

56
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,551
He makes them draw first...

57
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,200
then he kills them
in front of witnesses.

58
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,840
Sid, did he say how long
he was gonna stay?

59
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,195
No, he- he didn't say nothin'.

60
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,477
Buck, who do you suppose
he's after?

61
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,711
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe he isn't after anyone at all.

62
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,316
Mmm. He took a room.
He's not just passing through.

63
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,356
Yeah. Well, it could be anyone.

64
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,874
Anyone that has an enemy
that hates him enough.

65
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,791
Why don't <i>you</i> tell me
who he's after?

66
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,394
- What are you gonna do? Pick him up?
- On what charge?

67
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,869
Because he makes
Henry Reeger nervous?

68
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,791
Let me tell ya.

69
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,758
You watch some of our
respected citizens from now on.

70
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,910
You're gonna learn something.

71
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,309
And I'll tell you something else.

72
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,551
I've been a lawman here
for a good many years.

73
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,235
I can think of quite a few people
that'd like to see <i>me</i> dead.

74
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,754
Everybody steps
on somebody else's toes sometime.

75
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,990
You're the boss,
but if he's as bad as you say...

76
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,911
it's not gonna be nice
havin' him around.

77
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,991
I know it.

78
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,469
But we'll just have to
wait him out.

79
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,348
If I can pick him up
or run him out of town, I will.

80
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,911
If I can. But I can't do it
without an excuse.

81
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,116
We just have to wait
him out, that's all.

82
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,351
You gonna play or aren't ya?

83
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,877
Hello, Dutch.

84
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,553
"Dutch"? Who's Dutch?

85
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,235
- I don't know.
- Well, aren't you a Dutchman?

86
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,788
What's that got to do with it?
He wasn't talking to me.

87
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,030
What are you worried about, then?

88
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,190
What do you think?
He makes me nervous!

89
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,874
Well, you're not the only one.
That's all for me.

90
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,713
- Well, are we playin' or ain't we?
- Without me.

91
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,756
Me too.

92
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,197
Think he's after you, Henry?

93
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,111
What would he want with me?

94
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,998
I wouldn't know.
Thought maybe you would.

95
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,275
Could be after anyone.

96
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,716
What are you pushing me for, Ben?
Maybe he's after you.

97
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,669
Maybe you're right, Dutch.
Maybe he is.

98
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,590
Howdy. I'll be right with ya.

99
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,555
There. That your horse?

100
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,438
- That's right.
- That's a beautiful animal, well cared for.

101
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,796
You can tell a lot about a man
by examining his horse.

102
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,030
- I'm Luke Canfield.
<i>- Doc! Doc!</i>

103
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,430
You know who
just came into town, big as... life?

104
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,674
I-I'm sorry, Doc.
I-I didn't know you was busy!

105
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,558
- That's all right, Sid. Who came into town?
- Well-

106
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,551
Never mind.
I-It ain't important.

107
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,278
- My horse all right?
- He's fine. Just needed a shoe.

108
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,148
- You can take him now, Mister- Uh-
- Gant. He called you "Doc."

109
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,356
- That's right.
<i>- Hey, Luke! Gimme a hand.</i>

110
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,318
- All right.
- Clear that stump for me.

111
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,231
My father, Asa, Mr. Gant.

112
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,871
<i>- He's the blacksmith. I'm just a helper.</i>
- Your name's Gant?

113
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,037
That's right. John Gant.

114
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,117
Howdy, Mr. Gant.

115
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,111
- Your son's a doctor?
- That's right.

116
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,555
I'm what passes for one
here in Lordsburg.

117
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,189
Don't let him fool you, Mr. Gant.
He's the best in the Southwest.

118
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,510
<i>That boy, he'll fix you</i>
<i>if you're ailin'.</i>

119
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,353
Or if your horse is ailin'.
I'm also the vet.

120
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,715
- You stayin' here in town?
- The Soledad.

121
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,315
I'm goin' that way. I'll walk with you,
sort of show you around.

122
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,191
- Have to rebuild that wall every year.
- Nothin' like workin'
in a smith's, Mr. Gant...

123
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,271
to keep your body in trim.

124
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,396
Dad is a perfect example.

125
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,392
- You comin' home?
- No, I'll clean up first.

126
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,836
Mr. Gant, I'll take your horse
over to the stable.
They'll take good care of it.

127
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,718
- That'll be fine.
- Are you ready?

128
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,273
It's a nice town-
small enough to be comfortable,
but large enough to have a future.

129
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,839
You seem to like it here.

130
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,912
A town worth livin' in
is a town worth bein' proud of.

131
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,276
Luke the Physician.
You were well named.

132
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,239
That's my father's idea.
He made up his mind I'd be
a doctor before I was born.

133
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,675
I never had a chance.
What's your line, Mr. Gant?

134
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,718
<i>- Hi, Doc.</i>
- You might say we're in related fields.

135
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,950
I cure things too.

136
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,315
A smithy's an unusual place
to find a physician.

137
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,712
I've got an office over the bank,
but it's pretty hard
to get a sick horse up those stairs!

138
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,998
Well, you old mummy.
There you go, sleepin' again. Wake up!

139
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,719
I wasn't sleepin'.
I was thinkin'.

140
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,109
Well, then do it
with your eyes open.

141
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,077
You been 20 minutes!

142
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,710
Hey, Luke!
You got time for a game?

143
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,677
This old coot can't stay awake.

144
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,638
Wish I had, Charlie.
I can't now.

145
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,788
- Do you play chess?
- Oh, I play at it.

146
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,791
Well, I'd like to play you
a game, Physician.

147
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,111
- You'd make a good opponent.
- You gonna be in town
for a while? Why not?

148
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,919
- I'll be here for a while.
- We've got a date.

149
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,391
Did you lose something, Anne?

150
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,114
Luke Canfield,
since I was here last week...

151
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,475
how could a house get so messy?

152
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,074
It's a wonder you don't
tether your horse on that table.

153
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,233
- What's the matter with the table?
- If you don't know, it's not
gonna do any good to tell you.

154
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,151
- Where's your father?
- He'll be along.

155
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,151
So we've got to hurry.

156
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,796
- What's for supper?
- Oh, you're going to be
a romantic husband.

157
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,156
I've had a hard day
with one dyspeptic old woman...

158
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,710
one small boy's stomach-ache,
a gashed foot and a limping horse.

159
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,712
- That makes a man hungry.
- I hope Asa hurries. The roast is ready.

160
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,429
He wouldn't miss a Tuesday
night supper for anything.
That makes his whole week.

161
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,593
- How's your father?
- Oh, he had another bad night.

162
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,955
He seems to be better
during the day.

163
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,838
Sometimes the climate here
does remarkable things for consumption.

164
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,751
Sometimes.

165
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,150
I'm doing everything I can,
everything I know how to do.

166
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,118
I wish I knew more,
but I don't.

167
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,029
Let's take a look at the roast.

168
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,712
You ought to be as fat as a bull,
the way you keep shoveling it in.

169
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,031
After a week of what <i>you</i> do to food,
this is heaven.

170
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,669
- Why is it everything you cook
tastes like a prescription?
- What makes you think it isn't?

171
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,719
I suspicioned it. You better watch him
after you get married.

172
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,873
- He'll slip cod liver oil in the soup.
- Cod liver oil is good for you.

173
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,076
I'll get it.

174
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,431
- Good evening, Doc.
- Oh, come in, Sheriff.

175
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,829
- Oh, you're just havin' supper?
<i>- We just finished.</i>

176
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,559
- Hi, Asa. Hello, Anne.
- Evening, Sheriff.

177
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,790
What's on your mind, Sheriff?

178
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,236
- You talked with John Gant today.
- That's right.

179
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,357
- You know who he is?
- Uh, he's John Gant, I guess.

180
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,637
- I know.
- Am I supposed to
know something I don't?

181
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,598
That's right. You spent a lot of time
back East in school.

182
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,875
All right. Who is he?

183
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,076
He's a killer, Doc.

184
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,232
- Didn't act like one. Cup of coffee, Buck?
- Yeah, please.

185
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,118
He's a hired assassin.
He was sent here to kill somebody.

186
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,839
- That's his job.
- You sound mighty positive.

187
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,751
You know
the man's reputation, Asa.

188
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,638
Sure, but that's all I know.
I don't know the man.

189
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,551
Well, in this case
the reputation <i>is</i> the man.

190
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,359
- I doubt that, Buck.
- What makes you so sure?

191
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,069
Because he always works the same way.
He comes into a town, checks into a hotel.

192
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,038
Sticks around a few days,
sizing up the situation.

193
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,591
Then he picks a fight with his man.
He's never lost yet.

194
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,673
Just hearsay, Buck.
You can't condemn a man
on what you hear about him.

195
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,435
No, Asa. It's common knowledge.
Every lawman knows about him.

196
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,080
I got a stack of reports
from other states on him.

197
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,948
I'll admit I've never seen him,
but... I'm convinced.

198
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,919
You sound awfully sure he's after
somebody here. Who do you think it is?

199
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,117
- I thought maybe you could tell me.
- What makes you think I can?

200
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,191
You talked to him.

201
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,432
Maybe he dropped a hint.
Did he mention any names,
ask about anyone?

202
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,876
- No. We talked about chess.
- Chess?

203
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,076
Yeah. We're gonna play a game.

204
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,915
Yeah, that figures, all right.

205
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,549
Someday, Doc, you're gonna start living
in the same world with the rest of us.

206
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,792
Half of this town is scared
that Gant's gonna kill 'em,
and you're gonna play chess with him.

207
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,552
Why shouldn't he, Buck?

208
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,710
Until we know better,
Gant's just another man.

209
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,236
Even if he's what you say,
he's not after Luke or me.

210
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,151
Maybe.

211
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,152
It's a rare man that hasn't
made an enemy sometime in his life.

212
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,836
A man's guilt's his own burden, Buck,
and you can't do anything about it.

213
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,831
I might have to.

214
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,390
Doc...

215
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,153
if Gant stays here,
somebody's gonna die.

216
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,518
Now, that might be
the least that could happen.

217
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,592
Well, you go ahead
and play chess with him.

218
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,511
Maybe you'll learn something.

219
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,398
Assuming what you say is true,
why don't you move against him now?

220
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,268
I can't. I've got to have a legal reason.
Gant isn't a wanted man.

221
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,590
Anyhow, I-

222
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,911
I'm not sure I could stop him,
even if I had a reason.

223
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,514
Don't let yourself
get stampeded, Buck.

224
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,910
I'm sure everything can be worked out
peacefully if you really want it that way.

225
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,036
It takes two to make peace.

226
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,669
Gant's like a disease that
they haven't found a cure for.

227
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,234
Except for this.

228
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,198
He's supposed to be better
with this kind of medicine than anyone.

229
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,153
- Goodnight, Doc.
- Goodnight, Sheriff.

230
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,311
Gant. John Gant?

231
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,551
- Yeah. Do you know him, Judge?
- Well, I know of him.

232
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,517
So he's here.

233
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,353
- What's the matter, Judge?
- Huh? Nothing.

234
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,273
I guess I should have taken
your advice and gone to bed.

235
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,316
I'm a little tired.

236
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,198
Now you're being smart.
Take your medicine and get some sleep.

237
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,157
No. No more medicine.

238
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,118
You've gotta take it, Judge.
You may as well face facts.

239
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,988
This medicine is-
Well, you're still alive.

240
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,514
Yes, I'm still alive.

241
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,353
But does it really matter
how a man dies, or when...

242
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,079
when he knows
it's gonna happen?

243
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,397
You see that he takes it.

244
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,638
Gant ain't done a thing, Ben.

245
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,555
Last night he sat over there
drinking coffee until late.
Didn't talk to anybody at all.

246
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,951
Yes, Mr. Gant?

247
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,917
Give me some silver
for this, will ya?

248
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,870
- I'd like some coffee.
- Right, Mr. Gant.

249
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,352
There.

250
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,232
- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure!

251
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,311
I just saw them
talking together.

252
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,078
I told you we shouldn't
have tried to force Chaffee out, Earl!

253
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,196
He found the mine.
We only financed it.

254
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,555
Stop sniveling.
It's a perfectly sound business deal.

255
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,872
- Chaffee doesn't think it's just business.
- He'd do the same thing to us.

256
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,791
So that's why he hired Gant.

257
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,838
He wants sole ownership
of the mine. Use your head!

258
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,115
If he gets rid of us,
he's got it all!

259
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,909
- What are we gonna do?
- How do I know?

260
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,679
- I should never have listened
to you in the first place.
- Oh, shut up.

261
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,591
The money isn't worth it!

262
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,796
Money?

263
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,711
That might do it.

264
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,519
Money brought Gant here.
Maybe it can get him to leave.

265
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,471
Come on.

266
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,391
- Where to?
- To see Gant.

267
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,914
- Why do I have to go?
- You wanna stay alive, don't you?

268
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,911
This is your only chance!

269
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,675
Yes, Mr. Gant?

270
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,073
- Some more coffee.
- I'll have to make some fresh.

271
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,958
- Then make it.
- Yes, sir. I'll be right back.

272
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,675
Mr. Gant?

273
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,789
I'm Earl Stricker.
This is Thad Pierce.

274
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,156
- We've come to talk to you.
- Talk.

275
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,151
Well, can we, uh-

276
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,954
<i>All right if we sit down?</i>

277
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,235
We know why you're here.

278
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,197
You do?

279
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,910
I'll, uh, get right to it, Mr. Gant.
We wanna make a deal.

280
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,991
You don't say.

281
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,230
What kind of a deal?

282
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,437
Whatever you were paid to come here,
we'll- we'll double it...

283
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,351
if you'll leave right now.

284
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,476
Why?

285
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,551
<i>I-Isn't it obvious?</i>

286
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,553
<i>Yes. It's obvious.</i>

287
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,995
If it isn't enough...

288
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,117
you can name your own price.

289
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,839
<i>- Do you run a business?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

290
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,309
- A couple of 'em.
- I own the bank.

291
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,950
You heard I'm for sale,
and you think I can be bought off.

292
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,474
What makes you think
I'd be interested in you?

293
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,791
No! We didn't say we thought
anything of the kind!

294
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,151
That's right. You didn't.

295
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,993
You're just doing this as a favor
to the rest of the town.

296
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,516
- We can add two and two together.
<i>- Congratulations, banker.</i>

297
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,636
No deal.

298
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,995
You're making a mistake.

299
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,957
You'll never know, banker...

300
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,508
unless I have come for you.

301
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,116
- How about that coffee?
<i>- Yes, sir. Comin' right up, Mr. Gant.</i>

302
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,192
- Thad! Thad!
- I knew it wouldn't do any good!

303
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,590
- We've got to figure some other way.
- There is no other way!

304
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,511
Thad!

305
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,114
- Mr. Pierce, I-
- Shut up!

306
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,239
I don't want to see anyone.
Understand? Anyone!

307
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,431
- Hi, Doc.
- Hi.

308
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,960
- Afternoon, Doc.
- Hello, Ben.

309
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,156
- How's your boy?
- Seems much better today.

310
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,879
- How'd that new vein pan out?
- Oh, vein's fine.

311
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,111
It's not the vein that's worryin' me.
Anything happen in town?

312
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,270
- Such as?
- Gant.

313
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,590
No. Think something's
going to happen?

314
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,671
Don't you?

315
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,637
Milly's inside.

316
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,950
Ben, I just saw Stricker and Pierce.
They were talkin' with John Gant!

317
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,235
- Where?
- In the Soledad. They were real chummy.

318
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,595
Look, I think Charley's
down in the shaft. Go get him.

319
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,671
We've got some talkin' to do.

320
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,070
He's doing fine, Mrs. Chaffee.

321
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,073
This little Indian'll be out
catching lizards in a couple of days
if you keep him in bed.

322
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,435
- But I hate it in bed!
- Oh?

323
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,239
You wait till you grow up.
You'll change your tune.

324
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,118
Just keep forcing these down his throat.
He's about back to normal.

325
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,192
I know by tomorrow
I'll have to strap him in bed.

326
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,478
- All right, young man.
- Ma, I hate those awful big pills.

327
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,791
No need my coming here again.
Bring him in the office
next time you're in town.

328
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,792
Thank you, Doctor.
Come on, honey. Sit up.

329
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,832
We can't stand still for it.

330
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,673
If they get me out of the way,
you don't think you'll be safe!

331
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,320
There's one thing to do:
Beat Gant to the punch.

332
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,231
- Looks that way.
- Hiya, Doc.

333
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,595
- Hello, Hugo. Charley.
- How's the boy?

334
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,671
He's gonna be fine.

335
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,911
Doc, when you were talkin'
with Gant yesterday...

336
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,831
did he tell you anything?

337
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,196
Buck Hastings asked me the same thing.
Gant isn't very talkative.

338
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,670
Earl Stricker and Thad Pierce
hired Gant... to kill me.

339
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,878
- I doubt that, Ben.
- Yeah? Then how come they were
meetin' with him this morning?

340
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,078
- Hugo saw them.
<i>- I</i> was talking with Gant yesterday,
and <i>I</i> certainly didn't bring him here.

341
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,232
That's different. Stricker and Pierce
have every reason for wantin' me dead.

342
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,151
Everybody knows it.

343
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,071
Now, I ain't a troublemaker...

344
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,630
but I'm not standin' by and do nothin'
with Gant fixin' to kill me.

345
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,793
Ben, I wouldn't do anything rash.

346
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,553
Why don't you leave it up to
Buck Hastings? He's a good man.

347
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,473
Sure, he is. But I don't
think he can handle Gant.

348
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,917
- I don't think anybody can.
- There isn't much sense in trying
anything on your own, is there?

349
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,710
Well, maybe I can't handle Gant,
but Stricker and Pierce
are somethin' else again.

350
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,112
- What do you mean?
- We're not lettin' those crooks
take over the mine.

351
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,873
And you can tell Stricker I said so!

352
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,191
That ain't just talk, Luke.

353
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,191
Come on.

354
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,275
You're lyin'. You're a-lyin'
just as sure as you're sittin' there.

355
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,318
- You're lyin' in your teeth.
- What teeth?

356
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,757
- Well, you're lyin', anyhow.
- Why, I see'd it myself,
right outside of Veracruz.

357
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,469
Just one teeny little shot,
and the Eighth Illinois "et" dirt.

358
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,916
There you go, lyin' again.
Ed, you're just a natural born liar.

359
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,278
- It's a habit with you.
- Oh, I got you now.
You can't prove a thing!

360
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,432
Why, you simple-minded,
flea-bitten old coot!

361
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,990
If you weren't so old, I'd- I'd-

362
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,836
Hey, sonny. Would you mind
movin' aside a little bit?

363
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,751
You're cuttin' out the sun.

364
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,238
Now, let's see.
What was we talkin' about?

365
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,790
Well, by George, I forget.

366
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,997
So do I, but whatever it was,
you was lyin' about it.

367
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,640
Come on. Let's go
pitch some horseshoes.

368
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,991
Dad, what do you do when you
run up against a disease that
you're not equipped to cure?

369
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,150
What are you gettin' at?

370
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,708
I went out to
Chaffee's mine today.

371
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,475
I think Ben is gonna try and kill
Earl Stricker and Thad Pierce.

372
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,358
He thinks they hired Gant
to kill him.

373
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,749
Buck Hastings is scared.
I know he is.

374
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,308
I hear that Thad Pierce
has locked himself in his office.

375
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,836
And Henry Reeger is wearin' a gun.
It's the first time I ever saw him with one.

376
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,911
Everybody you talk to is jumpy.

377
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,037
What causes a thing like that?
The whole town is comin' apart.

378
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,193
I shouldn't have to tell you
what fear does to people.

379
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,713
Fear, that's one thing.

380
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,236
A man's a fool not to be careful
around a rabid dog or a wolf...

381
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,392
but he's more foolish
if he panics.

382
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,074
Well, it's gotta stop.

383
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,549
Only I don't know exactly
what it is that has to stop.

384
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,074
Let it develop. Wait and see.

385
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,390
I wouldn't let a cold develop
into pneumonia if I could help it.

386
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,439
Why not? You can't cure a cold,
but sometimes you can cure pneumonia.

387
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,511
You'd make a fine doctor.

388
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,511
Where you goin'?

389
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,030
Gonna play a game of chess.

390
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,433
Look at him.
The way he just sits there.

391
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,557
- Who does he think he is?
- Shut up, Lou.

392
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,598
I'll shut up when I'm ready.

393
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,833
I've about had it.
I'm tired of running!

394
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,388
I told you Sam would catch up
with us someday.

395
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,755
Then why didn't
he come himself?

396
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,912
I'll tell you why.
Because I'd kill him, and he knew it!

397
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,675
Sure, you would.
He was just scared to death of you!

398
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,558
He was a hundred times
the man you are.

399
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,154
Yeah? If you think so much of him,
why'd you leave him?

400
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,994
I wish I knew.
I-I keep wondering.

401
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,991
You keep wondering!

402
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,918
That stupid sawbones!

403
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,911
What's the matter with him?

404
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,438
I'm not gonna just sit back
and wait. That's for sure.

405
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,351
Lou Fraden don't eat crow.

406
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,989
No, Lou Fraden just runs
and runs and runs-

407
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,514
You think I'm afraid to go out there
and call him down, don't you?

408
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,309
Just because I've been clerkin'
for Stricker, you think
I forgot how to be a man?

409
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,231
You never knew how
to begin with.

410
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,118
Anyway, Gant doesn't want you.

411
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,031
Yeah? I know better.

412
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,194
No. Sam wouldn't dirty his hands
with you or me, either one.

413
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,511
Lou, you're not
even worth killing.

414
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,838
Go ahead, Lou. Be brave.

415
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,751
Go on.

416
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,311
Hmm.

417
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,269
Mr. Gant, why have you
come to Lordsburg?

418
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,670
Physician, I didn't ask you how
many tonsils you removed today.

419
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,671
Well, you're welcome to.

420
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,432
It doesn't interest me.

421
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,988
You've been here
less than 24 hours.

422
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,789
- Do you realize what your
coming here has done to this town?
- I've done nothing.

423
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,678
But you've got to admit
that as the only doctor in town...

424
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,389
I have a certain interest in what we
might call "the municipal state of health."

425
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,119
Did it ever occur to you that
you might be wasting your life?

426
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,316
I'm not wasting my life.

427
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,428
They're gonna die anyway.
Best you can do is drag out
their miserable lives. Why bother?

428
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,512
Death is inevitable
for all of us, Gant.

429
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,558
But we all try to put it off
for as long as possible.

430
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,909
It's occurred to me that the real
sicknesses, the most important ones...

431
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,752
are seldom physical.

432
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,718
I think I've had more experience
with those than you have.

433
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,439
Well, you sound more
like a preacher than-

434
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,711
Than a killer, Physician?

435
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,109
I don't know.

436
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,071
You think you've got a mission?

437
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,674
Yes. I try to keep people alive.

438
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,951
I've got a mission too.

439
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,389
I don't suppose you know why
he's locked himself in his office all day.

440
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,755
He's afraid of me.

441
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,718
Should he be?

442
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,839
I know nothing about the man,
except that he's a coward and a thief.

443
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,717
That's ridiculous.

444
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,633
Thad Pierce has done
a lot for this town.

445
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,950
Who'd he steal from?

446
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,030
I don't know...

447
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,070
but he is a thief.

448
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,833
Hmm. You play
a very interesting game.

449
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,992
I think you'd better get over
to the bank, Physician.

450
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,916
It's Mr. Pierce. He shot himself.

451
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,430
Wilson, what's goin' on in there?

452
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,036
It's awful, Mr. Stricker. The doc's
tryin' to keep him alive, but... his head.

453
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,308
It was because of Gant, wasn't it?

454
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,631
- What makes you think that?
- Couldn't be anything else.

455
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,109
He thought Gant was after him.

456
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,078
Poor Thad.

457
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,234
Doesn't make any difference.
No matter who Gant came after,
we gotta do something about it.

458
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,516
I can't feel his pulse any more.

459
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,837
He's dead. I couldn't stop it.

460
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,071
It's a miracle you kept him alive
as long as you did, Doc.

461
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,749
How can they do it?

462
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,150
How can they throw
this thing away?

463
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,994
The whole world struggles to live,
and some men kill themselves.

464
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,671
Or did he?

465
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,512
You were expecting it
to happen, weren't you?

466
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,036
- I wasn't surprised.
- You killed him.

467
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,951
You're wrong, Physician.

468
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,157
He started killing himself
long before I ever got here.

469
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,800
You've got it all figured out,
haven't ya?

470
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,598
You look at Gant,
and you say he's a murderer.

471
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,558
- Well?
- I've killed.

472
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,830
But the important point is,
who have I killed?

473
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,559
It doesn't make any difference.

474
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,676
My price is high.

475
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,469
The man who hires me
makes a considerable investment.

476
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,109
The death of a man without guilt is
seldom worth that much money to anyone.

477
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,071
You don't understand me,
do you, Physician?

478
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,596
Are you trying to tell me
that the men you've killed deserved to die?

479
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,594
Let's say, uh, most of them.

480
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,996
Even if I admit that there are men who
have done things deserving punishment...

481
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,674
I wouldn't grant you
or anyone else the right to punish them!

482
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,671
That's up to the law.

483
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,111
Take two men.

484
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,998
Say they have robbed and lied
and have never paid.

485
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,878
A man whom one of them has robbed
comes to me and says...

486
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,269
"Kill that man
who has robbed me."

487
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,191
And I kill him.

488
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,078
The other man becomes ill and would die,
except for a physician...

489
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,438
who returns him to health-
to rob and lie again.

490
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,750
Who's the villain in this piece?

491
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,831
Me or the physician?

492
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,794
Don't look as though
you think I'm insane.

493
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,711
You think about it.

494
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,149
Stop tellin' me what you want me to do,
and tell me how to do it!

495
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,071
Now, what am I gonna
charge Gant with?

496
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,596
You know as well as all of us.
He's responsible for Thad killing himself.

497
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,069
And you're worried
he'll be coming after you next.

498
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,870
- We're not asking you to jail him.
Just get him out of town.
- Oh, sure, Henry, sure.

499
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,758
I'll tell him you haven't been
sleeping nights. That oughta do it.

500
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,671
He's got a cute answer
for everything.

501
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,671
Buck, we're through arguing.

502
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,558
It's up to you and your deputy
to handle this situation...

503
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,279
and if you can't do it, we've been
paying the wrong men long enough.

504
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,828
Don't tempt me
to turn in my badge, Earl.

505
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,230
That idea's been running through my mind.
I'm not a bit proud of it.

506
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,199
- Hal, it looks like
you're elected along with me.
- Whatever you say.

507
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,397
- Let's go see how we make out.
- Buck.

508
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,349
Whatever you have to do,
I'll see that the town council
backs you up and makes it official.

509
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,795
- Can I depend on that?
- Yeah.

510
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,030
Well, that gives me an idea. Thanks.

511
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,476
<i>Mr. Gant, I'm Sheriff Hastings.</i>

512
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,438
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave town.

513
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,231
Why should I leave?

514
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,710
We've just put a law on the books
against a public nuisance.

515
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,711
Mr. Gant, you're a public nuisance.

516
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,431
Go away.

517
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,156
If you won't leave of your own accord,
then I'm gonna have to-

518
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,071
Why didn't you kill me?

519
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,310
I wasn't paid to.

520
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,356
Let's put this on.

521
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,791
All right.

522
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,791
There you are, Buck.

523
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,838
- You'll be as sound as
a dollar in a few weeks.
- Sure.

524
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,117
Even now it won't interfere
with your work, if you're careful.

525
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,317
Oh, I'm always careful.
Didn't you know that?

526
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,269
Well, Luke, what do we do now?

527
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,316
We don't even have any law.

528
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,868
Of course we do.
What's a bad arm to you?

529
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,033
Oh, no, it isn't the arm.
It's what it stands for.

530
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,350
Word gets around, you know?

531
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,117
- I understand, Hal.
- Buck, I'm sorry.

532
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,590
It's all right, son.
I don't blame you at all. I'll take it.

533
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,717
Buck's twice the gun I am.
I'm not gonna get myself killed!

534
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,277
I sure wish I could
hand my badge in that easily.

535
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,078
No, you don't, Buck.
We couldn't do without you.

536
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,516
No, Luke, I'm no good.
I can't help you.

537
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,795
The law can go only so far.

538
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,429
But you know, in a way I ought to
be kind of glad about this.

539
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,397
It means he didn't
come here for me.

540
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,313
- Maybe he didn't come here for anyone.
- Maybe not.

541
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,039
- Men are startin' to die anyway.
- I know it.

542
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,079
He could be as innocent as a baby,
but the things that are happening
are still his fault.

543
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,596
You're right.
Well, it's out of my field, anyhow.

544
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,955
It's more your kind
of a problem than mine.

545
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,635
The most useless man in town right now
is a man that's good with a gun.

546
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,553
I can't tell you
or anyone else what to do.

547
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,677
All I can tell you
is that my way isn't good enough.

548
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,513
If we're gonna get rid of Gant
and stop these killings...

549
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,319
we've just got to find
some other way, that's all.

550
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,836
Oh, uh, thanks
for patching me up, Doc.

551
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,438
It's too bad about Buck.
He's a good sheriff.

552
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,431
We'll never find
another one like him.

553
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,829
But I wouldn't blame him
if he resigned.

554
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,911
And now you want
to know what to do.

555
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,230
With Buck helpless,
we've got to do something.

556
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,231
Because if we don't-

557
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,914
Well, I've told you
the way things are in town.

558
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,788
I'm getting tired of coughing.

559
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,672
I'm sorry, Judge. I wish there
was something else I could do.

560
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,955
You've done all you can.

561
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,793
Luke, I haven't sat
on the bench in ten years.

562
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,793
The laws on the books may have changed,
but the law itself hasn't.

563
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,757
Law is the manifest will
of the people...

564
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,354
the conscious rule
of the community.

565
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,877
And when the mechanics of
law enforcement break down,
they must be re-established.

566
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,236
- Nobody would take Buck's job now.
<i>- Of course not.</i>

567
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,390
<i>So it's up to</i>
<i>the citizens as a whole.</i>

568
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,631
- You mean vigilantes, Dad?
- That's mob rule. I don't like it.

569
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,838
It doesn't have to be.
It usually winds up that way.

570
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,718
Well, here's an alternative, I suppose.

571
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,631
What?

572
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,554
Make it easy for Gant to finish
what he came here for. He'd leave then.

573
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,915
That's ridiculous.
He came here to kill.

574
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,039
It would be one man's life against the life
of the town. Wouldn't it be worth it?

575
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,759
Of course it wouldn't.
You're not serious.

576
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,949
What sort of a man is Gant?

577
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,235
I don't really know. Why?

578
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,073
Just curiosity.

579
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,958
I don't like that vigilante idea.
There's gotta be another way.

580
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,112
Well, if you find one,
let me know.

581
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,555
Luke, how-

582
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,950
- How long did you say I've got left?
- Dad!

583
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,156
I don't think
we ought to talk about it.

584
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,676
Let's be adult, Luke.
Anne knows all about it.

585
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,671
Well, anything can happen.

586
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,469
- It was about six months, wasn't it?
- Maybe, if you're careful.

587
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,358
You're not thinking
of doing anything foolish?

588
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,512
I quit doing foolish things long ago.

589
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,037
Judge, I'm sorry I worried you with this.
You forget about it.

590
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,588
It's a hard thing to forget.

591
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,274
I like this town.

592
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,715
Luke, I'm glad about you and Anne.

593
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,631
So am I, Judge.

594
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,757
You try those new compounds
and try and get some sleep, huh?

595
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,751
I'll wake you for dinner.

596
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,598
All right,
what's on your mind, Henry?

597
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,797
I'm fed up with this guessing game
of who Gant's after.

598
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,031
Now that Hastings has bungled the job,
we've got to do something.

599
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,633
Got any ideas?

600
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,917
Some of your drivers are good men.
I've got a few friends.

601
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,958
We get everybody together,
Gant won't stand a chance.

602
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,349
Maybe, if everybody goes with us.

603
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,432
Mr. Reeger, you'd better come back.
Lou Fraden's getting himself
liquored up for trouble.

604
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,638
He says Gant's here after him,
and he's getting drunk enough
to try to take him on.

605
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,518
You go on back, Sid.
We'll be over in a minute.

606
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,149
There's a good chance
that Lou may be right.
I don't know much about him.

607
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,437
- Maybe Gant did come after him.
- Who'd pay good money
to have him killed?

608
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,637
I said it was a small chance,
buy why interfere?

609
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,915
Suppose he does go against Gant.

610
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,355
He just might get lucky.

611
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,073
Lou. Lou, I want to talk to you.

612
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,433
Gant!

613
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,829
I'm through running.

614
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,309
I've taken all I'm gonna.

615
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,120
Sam Ellis never was a man.

616
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,668
He wasn't man enough
to keep his own wife!

617
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,752
Now he ain't man enough to do
his own killin'. He's gotta send you!

618
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,956
You'd better go away, little friend.

619
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,272
<i>Sendin' a vulture like you</i>
<i>won't get him back. You tell him that!</i>

620
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,831
No, you can't tell him that.
You'll be dead.

621
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,196
- Lou, don't be a fool.
- Shut up, Doc!

622
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,671
If nobody else is man enough
to stop this murderer, I'll do it.

623
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,558
Why do you want
to kill me, friend?

624
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,359
You know why.

625
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,511
All right.

626
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,797
If you think you can do it,
go ahead and try.

627
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,269
Look at my hands.
They're on the table.

628
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,952
<i>You could beat me to the draw.</i>

629
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,395
<i>I couldn't possibly outdraw you.</i>

630
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,638
So go ahead and shoot.

631
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,989
I'll shoot.

632
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,991
You think I'm yellow.

633
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,593
Be a shame to waste
all that whisky.

634
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,316
Go ahead. I thought
you wanted to kill me.

635
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,475
You want me to.

636
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,551
You want me to draw.

637
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,911
Oh, no.

638
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,270
Oh, no, you don't.

639
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,273
You want a chance at me.
You want to kill me!

640
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,911
Everybody, look. You see?

641
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,754
I didn't go for my gun!
He's got no excuse!

642
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,910
He can't kill me now!

643
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,631
Physician.

644
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,996
I'm sorry about your sheriff.
He had courage.

645
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,150
What you did wasn't necessary.

646
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,038
I wouldn't have done it
if it hadn't been.

647
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,634
<i>You're brewin' big trouble</i>
<i>for yourself.</i>

648
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,314
Who from? Men like him?

649
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,231
Gant, I'm a healer.

650
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,756
I've devoted my life to it,
and I intend to continue.

651
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,550
Right now I've got one big public
health problem, and I'm looking at it.

652
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,277
I like you, Physician.
You're like me.

653
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,477
You and I may well be
the only two honest men in town.

654
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,678
Don't compare us.
We've got nothing in common.

655
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,676
Everybody dies.

656
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,920
I didn't hear any shots.

657
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,514
Start packing.
We're leaving town.

658
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,638
Sam must hate us
even more than I thought.

659
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,029
He's gonna
let us stay together.

660
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,519
Well, cheer up, Lou.

661
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,195
After all,
we got what we wanted:

662
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,350
each other.

663
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,030
<i>- I kinda wish it was official-like.</i>
<i>- Who's gonna make it official?</i>

664
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,270
<i>You want Hastings to help?</i>
<i>He's already tried.</i>

665
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,635
<i>Maybe you want old Judge Benson</i>
<i>to give you his blessing?</i>

666
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,029
- Well?
- Gant's still sitting on the porch.

667
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,190
I ran into Asa,
and he's going after Luke.

668
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,794
Wants us to wait
until they get here.

669
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,075
We're not waiting for anybody.

670
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,152
We all know why we're here,
and we know what we've gotta do.

671
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,151
I'd feel better with
Luke and Asa with us.

672
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,674
There are enough of us
to handle Gant without them.

673
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,877
- He's only one man.
<i>- That's right.</i>

674
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,110
He's only one man.

675
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,391
What are you doing here, Hastings?

676
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,550
Trying to keep you
from being a pack of fools.

677
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,677
You keep out of it, Buck.
We'll handle it our own way.

678
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,469
With guns? I can tell you all you need to
know about goin' against him with a gun.

679
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,994
- I think there's enough of us.
- I doubt it.

680
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,798
Buck, you got eyes.

681
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,792
You can't expect this town
to just sit back and let him have his way.

682
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,599
The town?

683
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,592
Well, just what has the town
got to do with it?

684
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,989
Some of you people have
been sold a bill of goods.

685
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,878
Earl isn't worried about the town,
he's worried about his own skin.

686
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,315
- Just take it easy.
- And Reeger!

687
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,198
He has his own reasons for bein' worried.
Ask him about 'em.

688
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,477
If we let Gant go on,
we won't have any town to live in!

689
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,233
Buck, maybe you're right,
but it don't cut ice.

690
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:01,233
You can't do anything about it,
and it's up to the rest of us.

691
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,118
I don't like it much,
but what else can we do?

692
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,839
All right. We've talked enough.
Let's go.

693
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,992
Oh, listen to me!
A mob isn't the answer!

694
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,598
You couldn't wait, Earl.

695
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,478
- You're determined
to get somebody killed.
- Only Gant.

696
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,358
We're gonna tell him either he gets on
his horse right now and gets out of town...

697
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,271
or we're gonna gun him down.

698
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,191
Who's gonna do the talkin'?
You, Earl?

699
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,350
Why not? You think
you can do any better?

700
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,034
Well, maybe I can.
At least I can try.

701
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,032
- Asa will go with me.
The rest of you wait here.
- No.

702
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,591
We're stayin' right behind you.
He'll listen better lookin' down
the muzzles of a dozen guns.

703
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,319
There's time for that later,
if we have to.

704
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,359
- Give me a chance to try and
work it out without bloodshed.
- You'll have your chance.

705
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,635
You can do all the talkin'
you want to.

706
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,314
But when you fall flat on your face,
then we're gonna do it my way.

707
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,198
It's either that, or you can
stay out of it altogether.

708
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,316
Gant won't dare
go against all of us.

709
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,994
You're goin' with us?

710
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,991
- All right.
- Come on.

711
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,991
Gant?

712
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,790
You're an organizer
as well as a physician.

713
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,156
I've come to ask you to leave.

714
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,071
And you come alone
and unafraid.

715
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,119
We're not gonna argue with you, Mr. Gant.
We ask you to leave quietly.

716
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,071
And if I don't?

717
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,675
I'm tryin' to stop violence, Gant,
not cause it.

718
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,558
I ask you to consider what
will happen if you refuse.

719
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,391
I've thought of it.

720
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,198
Ask him who he's after, Doc.

721
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,714
It doesn't make any difference
who he's after.

722
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,711
<i>We're not gonna sacrifice anyone.</i>

723
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,351
All right, Doc, you've talked enough.
Now we'll do it our way.

724
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,351
There are many of you!

725
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,115
Yes, you could kill me,
if you're willing enough.

726
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,239
But it's only fair to tell you first
that I'll kill you, Stricker...

727
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,428
and you, Dutch Henry...

728
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,876
the physician, his father...

729
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,194
and there might even be
time for you, storekeeper.

730
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,279
You surprise me, Physician.

731
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,148
<i>I didn't expect to see you</i>
<i>running with the pack.</i>

732
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,914
You've come against me once.

733
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,956
Now I warn you.

734
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,077
I'll stay here
until I'm ready to leave.

735
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,516
I use my gun for money,
and I don't like to work for nothing.

736
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,070
<i>But you trouble me again</i>
<i>and I may have to break my rule.</i>

737
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,636
That's my prescription, Physician.

738
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,391
You'd better have it filled.

739
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,237
You're not making any progress.
Keep working at it.

740
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,914
- I thought you were going into town.
- After you finish breakfast.

741
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,357
You've only been at it an hour.
We still have the rest of the day.

742
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,351
Who's that?

743
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,791
It's Luke.

744
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,599
- Good morning, Anne.
- Hello.

745
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,353
- You all right?
- Why shouldn't I be?

746
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,476
We don't live
on the moon out here.

747
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,518
I know about what happened in town,
and I know that you were part of it.

748
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,956
Nothing came of it, honey,
so there's nothing to be excited about.

749
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,996
- Good morning, Judge.
<i>- Good morning, Luke.</i>

750
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,277
But Buck Hastings said that Gant
threatened to kill you.

751
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,158
That's a foolish thing for Buck to say.
When was he here?

752
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,879
He was sitting on the porch
waiting when I got up.

753
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,350
- I don't think he had much sleep.
- Why did he bother you?

754
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,558
He was hoping I could suggest
something to do about Gant. I couldn't.

755
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,235
I was with Buck until almost 2.00
this morning talking about the same thing.

756
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,039
We couldn't come up
with any new answers either.

757
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,510
- Maybe we'd better go back
to the old way.
- You tried that last night.

758
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,991
No, last night Asa and I were
angrier with Stricker and Reeger
than we were with Gant.

759
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,753
We were the ones who insisted
on trying to talk with him.

760
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,831
Luke, please don't
get involved in this.

761
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,070
But I am involved in it.
We all are.

762
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,674
Can't sit back and have people afraid
to walk the streets.

763
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,274
- Would you like some coffee?
- Oh, fine.

764
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,476
I'll heat it up.

765
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,030
Trouble is, I can't make
my mind accept that...

766
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,918
Gant is the vicious killer
I know him to be.

767
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,913
I've played chess with him.
I've talked to him.
I found myself liking him.

768
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,753
Viciousness in men, Luke, is inside.

769
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,990
- Deep inside.
<i>- But why?</i>

770
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,311
What caused it? I keep wanting to know
what makes him tick.

771
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,029
Well, it's usually a kind
of logical progression.

772
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,270
A youngster starts
running with a gang.

773
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,069
Sooner or later they're killed off
or sent to prison...

774
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,151
until he's the only one left.

775
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,074
He's gotten away with killing
and he keeps going with it, alone.

776
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,628
Pretty soon
he's everybody's enemy.

777
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,711
He can't let himself
even like someone...

778
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,109
because someday
he might have to kill them.

779
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,236
By then there's
no turning back.

780
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,629
Even if he wants to
throw his gun away, he can't...

781
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,952
because he knows
that just around the bend
there's someone that'll kill him.

782
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,351
A lot of that
could be just in his mind.

783
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,590
Maybe he can quit
and get away with it.

784
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:15,117
Maybe this killer around the bend
isn't there at all and is just
something he's afraid of.

785
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,714
You're still wrestling with the idea that,
given half a chance...

786
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,995
you could talk him into
a different kind of life.

787
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,878
- I wish I could.
<i>- It wouldn't do any good, Luke.</i>

788
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,030
A man can't escape his past.

789
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,951
Here we are.

790
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,874
Just the coffee, honey.
I've got some patients in the office.

791
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,270
If you can wait till I hitch up the buggy,
we can go to town together.

792
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,511
- I've got some shopping to do.
- All right, that's fine.

793
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,838
Look at it.
And don't argue with me, Jim Merts.

794
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,036
That was cracked
when you sold it to me.

795
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,429
Then why didn't you say so then?

796
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,080
You can't hold me
responsible for-

797
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,111
- Here. Excuse me.
- Well!

798
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,068
About last night, Mr. Gant,
I hope you don't think
that I had anything-

799
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,991
Some shaving soap, please.

800
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,957
Yes, sir.

801
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,591
Good morning, Miss Benson.

802
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,511
Good morning.

803
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,511
Excuse me.

804
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,276
You're a very lucky
young woman, Miss Benson.

805
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,669
I like the man
you're going to marry.

806
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,671
I find him remarkable.

807
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,069
But he told me-
Well, last night-

808
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,358
I don't meet very many honest men.
I respect them when I do.

809
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,271
Mr. Gant.

810
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,193
Mr. Merts, would you
send this on over to the house?

811
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,158
- I should be getting back to Dad.
- Sure, Anne.

812
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,310
Excuse me, Mr. Gant.

813
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,029
Miss Benson?

814
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,429
If I may, I'll walk with you.

815
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,670
If you like.

816
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,595
I understand
your father's an invalid.

817
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,511
Yes.

818
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,558
I'm sorry to hear that.
Nothing serious, I hope.

819
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,517
Well, I'm afraid so.

820
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,957
- Luke's been treating him.
He's a wonderful doctor.
- I'm sure of it.

821
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,316
- Your father's bedridden?
- No, not entirely.

822
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,709
But he is too weak
to leave the house.

823
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:19,032
- He's a judge, isn't he?
- He was once. Why?

824
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,190
Judges interest me.

825
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,078
They have the power
of life and death.

826
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,991
So do physicians.

827
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,470
Mr. Gant, who have you
come to see?

828
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,268
Perhaps anyone, Miss Benson.

829
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,828
I don't quite understand.

830
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,718
Everyone has enemies,
Miss Benson.

831
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,631
Everyone.

832
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,395
I'd rather go the rest of
the way myself, Mr. Gant. Good day.

833
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,190
Remember,
it's Stricker we want.

834
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,909
If Gant or anybody else butts in,
do some shootin' and do it fast.

835
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,798
- How about Buck Hastings?
- He won't be botherin' anybody.

836
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,552
Come on. Let's go.

837
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,431
Dad, I'm home.

838
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,110
Secrets?

839
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,395
Not from you.

840
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,197
- What's the matter, honey?
- Nothing.

841
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,396
- It's funny.
- What is?

842
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,278
You'll never guess
who I was talking to today.

843
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,954
Don't tell me
Luke has competition.

844
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,598
It was John Gant.

845
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,155
- What did he want with you?
- I don't know.

846
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,118
He just walked up to me
in the store and started talking.

847
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,714
Oh, Dad, you don't think
it's me he's after?

848
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,473
- No, no, no, of course not, but-
- Anne?

849
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,437
In here.

850
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,514
I saw you from my window
talking with John Gant.

851
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,989
You too?
What's the matter with you men?

852
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,356
I don't like it. I don't want you
to have anything to do with him.

853
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,829
You're being jealous,
Dr. Canfield. You actually are.

854
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,674
Don't be silly. It's just that
it's dangerous to be around him.

855
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,718
Somebody might decide to
take a shot at him any time.

856
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,268
Hello, Judge. How do you feel?

857
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,476
Fine.

858
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,391
Sit down.

859
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,311
All right.

860
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,991
Luke, I've been thinking.

861
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:32,358
- I know how to stop your man for good.
- You do?

862
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,749
No one's been able
to convict Gant of murder...

863
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,832
because he's always been
able to prove self-defense.

864
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,309
He's never shot down
a man in cold blood.

865
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,470
- That's my understanding.
<i>- Yes.</i>

866
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,075
But suppose the man Gant
has come after, whoever he is...

867
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,072
would be willing to die
to stop Gant for all time.

868
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,515
I don't follow you.

869
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,592
Suppose his man this time
refuses to defend himself...

870
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,514
would willingly sit there
and force Gant to commit murder.

871
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,431
That's a little farfetched, isn't it?

872
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,988
Nobody in his right mind
would let himself be murdered.

873
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,389
No, I suppose not.

874
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:10,554
It would be a hard thing to do,
to give up even a moment of life.

875
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,438
Everybody wants to live.
Isn't that what you say?

876
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,839
- That's right.
- What are you doing?

877
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,595
Now look, Judge, I thought we agreed
there'd be no more smoking.

878
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,989
It was a bad bargain.
You got me in a weak moment.

879
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:24,550
Judge, I won't take the responsi-

880
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,516
It's Chaffee. He's headed
for Stricker's place. I'll see you later.

881
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,150
Gabe! Frank! It's Chaffee!

882
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,151
Cover me.

883
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,229
Stop it, you crazy fools!
Stop it! Stop it!

884
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,231
Stop it!

885
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,314
Doc, guess Stricker-

886
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,278
Guess Stricker didn't
need Gant after all.

887
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,271
You're gonna be all right.

888
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,794
Earl's dead, Doc, and Frank's got hit.
He's inside.

889
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,553
In a minute.
Get my bag off my horse.

890
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,391
Easy, Ben. Easy.

891
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,432
I knew this was gonna happen.

892
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,431
- I could have stopped it.
- It wasn't your fault, son.

893
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,598
No, it wasn't. It was Gant's.

894
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,070
You're a doctor, boy.
This is where you're needed most.

895
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,791
All right, Dad.
Bring him inside.

896
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,637
Make out my bill
and get my horse. I'm leaving.

897
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,870
Oh. Yes, sir!

898
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,792
What are you doing?

899
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,474
Just tidying up a little.

900
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,835
Why was the door closed?

901
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,911
I didn't realize they were.

902
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,877
I have to go out for a while.

903
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,633
You just came in
a little while ago.

904
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,076
Well, I forgot to go
to the dressmaker's. I won't be long.

905
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,911
Well, Miss Benson.

906
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,195
Where can I find John Gant?

907
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,068
Why, he's up in his room,
number seven.

908
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,038
But I wouldn't go up there
if I were you.

909
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,231
Who is it?

910
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,437
<i>Anne Benson.</i>
<i>I want to talk to you, Mr. Gant.</i>

911
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,751
I'm gonna kill you, Mr. Gant.

912
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,151
Would you mind telling me why?

913
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,038
Because I know now
that you've come to kill my father...

914
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,918
and I'm not gonna
let you do it.

915
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,594
Then you should have
loaded your gun.

916
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,470
- What was that?
- Anne Benson's up there.

917
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,471
We'd better get
the doc over here.

918
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,471
You stay here. I'll get him.

919
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:59,034
Mr. Gant, please,
I beg you, don't do it.

920
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,588
He hasn't long to live.

921
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,870
I'm sorry about that.

922
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,475
Oh, no, you're not.
You like to kill.

923
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,996
But it won't do any good.
He's not going to defend
himself against you.

924
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,833
He's going to make you murder him,
and they'll hang you!

925
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,639
He told Luke that that was
the only way to stop you.

926
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,995
Kill him, and you'll hang!

927
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:28,072
Then I'll have to do
something about that, won't I?

928
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,394
Luke.

929
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,391
Luke!

930
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,031
- My bill.
- Yes, sir.

931
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,519
Luke!

932
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,238
She's still up there,
but Gant left.

933
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,471
Anne?

934
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,391
Anne?

935
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,272
Anne!

936
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,269
Anne, it's Luke. What happened?

937
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,158
I'm all right. It's Dad!
He's gone after Dad!

938
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,470
- Take it easy.
- No, it's true! He admitted it!

939
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,949
Please, Luke, you've got
to stop him. Please!

940
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,751
Stay with her, Sid.

941
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,718
- What happened?
- Gant's after the judge.
Is the buckboard hitched up?

942
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,233
Yeah.

943
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,631
Mr. Gant?

944
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,636
Some of your former associates
back East send their regards.

945
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,193
So I see.

946
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,431
You're not afraid?

947
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:24,399
I've been dying for a long time.
Death's an old friend.

948
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,318
But some of your other
old friends are impatient.

949
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,868
They always were.

950
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,591
What are they afraid of, Gant?

951
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,511
I didn't ask.

952
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,558
I know anyway.

953
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,838
No one knows the structure of an edifice
better than the architect.

954
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,275
If I were to tell what I know...

955
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:57,478
it would send the governor
and the mayor...

956
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:00,279
and myself to jail.

957
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,432
The two of them would make
distinguished convicts.

958
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,195
- Perhaps.
- But killing me won't silence me.

959
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,158
It'll all come out, anyway.

960
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,276
That's their problem.

961
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,551
Well, go ahead, Mr. Gant.

962
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,676
I don't intend to resist you.

963
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,272
Other men have warned me
that they wouldn't defend themselves...

964
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,396
but they all wound up trying.

965
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,431
You have a lovely daughter.

966
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,794
I found her
very pleasant company...

967
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,791
but I'm afraid
the feeling wasn't mutual.

968
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,913
What are you talking about?

969
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,436
I thought you might like
this little remembrance of her.

970
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,109
What did you do to her?

971
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,628
What did you do to her?

972
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,115
Gant, I'll-

973
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,720
Gant, I'll-

974
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,274
Gant, I'll kill you!

975
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,435
Gant, I'll-

976
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,110
I have no quarrel with you, Physician.
Stand aside.

977
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,032
Gant!

978
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,838
- Luke, are you all right?
- I'm all right.

979
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,720
Luke, he didn't
shoot the judge.

980
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,077
A lot of people would
like to kill John Gant...

981
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:49,789
but it took a healer with a hammer
to make it easy for them.

982
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,717
<i>Gant.</i>

983
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,429
I could take
a look at that arm.

984
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,511
<i>Don't worry about it, Physician.</i>

985
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,029
Everything comes to a finish.
