(Echoing) A storm is coming...

10
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:16,041
We're backing up in here.
And I only got two hands, Carter.

11
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:18,082
Where the hell's DG?

(Siren wails)

13
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,332
Carter's looking for you. He's mad.
He's not the only one.

(Carter) DG!

15
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,874
Sorry, Carter.
Bad enough Evie's got to run

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,249
and take care of that potato-head son
of hers during the lunch rush,

17
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,332
now you're perfecting
the art of being late.

18
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:14,624
Carter! Guy on four wants a slice
of French apple and a chunk of Cheddar.

19
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,041
(DG) It won't happen again.

20
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:18,541
A lot of people would fight
for a job like this.

21
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,666
Your future's in the here and now, kid.
Don't throw it away.

22
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,999
Right. I've seen the line
stretching across the prairie

23
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,666
for this stepping stone.

24
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:28,666
Fella who wanted pie asked
for you special, DG. Table four.

25
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:31,332
What, you just going to stand there?
Go. Go, go.

26
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,249
This isn't my day.

27
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,166
Sure isn't.

28
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:46,749
Thank you.

29
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:16,624
Oh, for God's sakes!
That bad, popsicle?

30
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,291
Barometer's falling, the wind's rising,

31
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:22,374
and I can't get these
new turbines to throw a watt.

32
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,499
The spinner in Milltown was
never as complicated as this.

33
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:29,541
(Laughs) Well, everything's
better in Milltown, right?

34
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:34,999
Well, I did have to walk three miles
through the snow to get to school.

35
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,624
Heard you tossing and turning
again last night.

36
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,707
Oh, yeah.

37
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,457
Your creepy cave nightmare again?

38
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,707
Yeah, it was different this time.
I wasn't alone. There was a woman there.

39
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,707
She had the most beautiful
lavender eyes I've ever seen.

40
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,582
Liz Taylor?
(Laughs)

41
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,832
No, here. Actually, I drew a picture of her.

42
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,124
Whoa...

43
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,041
She could escort me
through my dreams any night.

44
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:06,749
She said, uh, "A storm is coming."

45
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:09,999
What storm?

46
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,374
I don't know. I'll ask
for clarification next time.

47
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,874
(Electricity sparking)

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,499
Oh, ho-ho-ho! All right!
(Turbine whirring)

49
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:22,916
Elmer Gulch
is a menace to the community.

50
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:25,374
Menace or no, he is an officer of the law.

51
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,124
You're gonna have to face the judge.

52
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,207
Officer Gulch wants you in jail.

53
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,707
(Scoffs) He doesn't want me in jail.

54
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,999
He wouldn't have
anybody to chase then.

55
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,874
This is not a joke. We'll be lucky
if they just impound your bike.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,374
Then can't impound my bike
if I take off on it.

57
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,499
I was wondering if you were
planning a trip.

58
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,707
You went through my stuff?

59
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,207
She's been worried. We both have.

60
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,332
You've been acting strange, distant.

61
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,499
If you spend your every spare moment
drawing your pictures,

62
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,791
dreaming of another life,

63
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:05,291
you're gonna wind up
never living the one you got.

64
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:06,957
But this isn't my life.

65
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,249
This town, that job taking
other people's orders,

66
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,166
that's just passing time.

67
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:14,249
There has to be more to life than this.

68
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,082
And you really think you'll find better
out there?

69
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,749
Look, I love you guys,
I just don't feel at home here.

70
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,499
I don't think I ever have.

71
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:32,124
Our job in this world has been to be
the best parents that we can be.

72
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,166
And it's one we've done proper.

73
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,082
But she's a young woman now.

74
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,499
DG is having the dream.

75
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,999
(Squeaking)

76
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,041
(Bird cawing)

77
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,499
Knock, knock!

78
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:14,207
You know your mom loves you
more than anything in this world.

79
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,291
I know.

80
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:20,332
I just...wish that
she understood how I felt.

81
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:28,249
You know, you're as good an artist
as you are a mechanic.

82
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:31,832
The world's going to be your oyster...
someday.

83
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,916
I remember when I was in Milltown...

84
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:42,416
Dad, could you please stop talking about
your perfect chiIdhood in Milltown?

85
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:45,082
This is real life.
Harass your old man all you want.

86
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,207
These sketches remind me of home.

87
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,166
No matter where we find ourselves,

88
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,374
home is where your heart is.

89
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,666
I can't stay here forever.

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,666
There's a place and a time

91
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:10,041
when we learn where
we're supposed to be.

92
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:13,207
And you're almost there...

93
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,499
And...

94
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,582
don't forget, all of life's answers...

95
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,999
Are found along the old road.
I remember.

96
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,999
The one about the daughter of light
who searches for her home...

97
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,499
Frozen in time on a sea of ice.
You got to get some new material, Dad.

98
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,499
And you've got to realize
that I'm not a little girl anymore.

99
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,082
You'll always be my baby girl.

100
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:28,207
General...my search teams have returned
from the Northern Guilds empty-handed.

101
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,291
She will be less than happy.

102
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:32,291
(Muttering) She always is.

103
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,166
(Woman) You made me a promise.

104
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:42,291
Unfortunately, there were complications
with the resistance spies in the North.

105
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,999
A slight delay, Sorceress. That's all.

106
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,082
(Whispering voices)

107
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,999
The emerald, Lonot.

108
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:01,541
Where's my emerald?

109
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,957
We will double our efforts,
close the vice even tighter.

110
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,999
All I need is a little more time.

111
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,166
There is no more time.

112
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:14,291
In seven days, the double eclipse
will darken our skies.

113
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:16,499
If I don't have the emerald
in my hand by then,

114
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:20,374
everything I have worked so hard for...

115
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,207
all of this...

116
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,916
will be lost.

117
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,832
We will have it before then.

118
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,916
I give you my word.

119
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,207
(Whispering voices)

120
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,624
Something wrong, Sorceress?

121
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,166
I need to see Lylo.

122
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,499
Peer into the future.

123
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,832
Tell me if there's anything

124
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,416
that will hinder my plans.

125
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,041
It hurts Lylo to look.

126
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,957
(Buzzing and crackling)

127
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,666
It will hurt more if you don't.

128
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,416
(Gasping in pain)

129
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,416
Those who resist you
will continue to be conquered.

130
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,416
The emerald, Lylo.

131
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:37,749
Will I find it in time?

132
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,082
(Gasping)

133
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:52,291
Where is it?

134
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,249
Lylo knows not.

135
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,291
But before the eclipse,
in your hand it will be.

136
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:02,457
It will be!

137
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,166
Do you see anything
that will stand in my way?

138
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,791
(Gasping)
Lylo see nothing.

139
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,916
But...

140
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,582
But what?

141
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,374
Lylo feels...

142
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,457
a presence.

143
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:32,166
A...a glimmer of light
in the darkness.

144
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,499
Light from the other side.

145
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,707
(Sorceress) The other side?

146
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,916
General Lonot...

147
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,832
awaken a travel storm.

148
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,166
Take a small company of men,

149
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,249
and just slip through to the other side.

150
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,749
Find this light

151
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,791
and extinguish it.

152
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,541
(Yowls)

153
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:51,541
A storm is coming!

154
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,749
(Cries out)
A storm is coming...

155
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,707
Wind must be
shorting out the power.

156
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:00,499
Where is she?

157
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,499
Ow, ow!

158
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,249
Dad! Are you OK?

159
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,082
No, DG, go back!
(Screams)

160
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,166
Ow! Ow!

161
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,166
(Groaning)

162
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,999
Go, go, go!

163
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:28,541
Ah!

164
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,166
Dad, come on!

165
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:33,666
Get this thing off me!

166
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,749
Dad, are you OK?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

167
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,332
Turn this around.

168
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,666
Push it down the stairs. Yeah.

169
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,124
Go, go!

170
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,207
Dad, who were those guys?
Longcoats.

171
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,791
What?
This wasn't the way it was planned.

172
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,166
I know, but it's our only chance!
We have to take her there now!

173
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:05,332
Take me where?
There's no time to explain, DG.

174
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,041
Dad, what are you doing?
Trust me!

175
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:17,041
(Mother) You have to jump!
No!

176
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,457
(Father) You have to jump!
No!

177
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,291
(Roaring)

178
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:25,749
We need to go, DG!
The Longcoats are after you!

179
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,416
What? Why?

180
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:31,041
Because it's time!
Time for what?

181
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,249
What are you doing?

182
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,082
(Father) You have to trust us!
(Screaming)

183
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,791
(Gunshots and screaming)

184
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,207
(Gunshots)

185
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:20,999
(Birdsong)

186
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,416
(Gasps) Mom!

187
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,624
Dad!

188
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:48,999
Where am I?

189
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,249
Hello?

190
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,582
Hello!

191
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,166
(Faint whispering)

192
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,332
(Woman) Beware...

193
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,082
(Whispering)

194
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,874
(Gasps)

195
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,624
Oh, you have to be kidding me.
Watchful. Be watchful.

196
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,041
I like not the look of her.

197
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,832
Back off, Jack!
And gaze not into her eyes,

198
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,291
for fear she'll turn you into a skree.

199
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:02,041
Who are you?
I'm DG. Who are you?

200
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,374
I am Red Hatt.

201
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,624
We are resistance fighters
of the Eastern Guild.

202
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,791
Do not speak of who we be.
We know not of her trickery.

203
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,707
Trickery?

204
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,541
My parents are missing.

205
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:16,207
I'm the victim of some sort
of a natural disaster.

206
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,207
Creatures do not fall
from the sky lacking magic.

207
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,999
Mobats fall from the sky.
Mobats have wings!

208
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,416
Wings or not, she's a spy!

209
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:25,916
A spy from the sky!

210
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:27,541
No, I'm not a spy.

211
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:28,999
I'm not a spy.

212
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,124
(Screams)

213
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,499
Get her to the camp.

214
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,707
Stop your worrying.

215
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,332
Of course the people of the O.Z.
will be taken care of.

216
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,666
I never said that.
You did. No, you didn't.

217
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:53,749
Don't say that.

218
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,332
Perhaps we should return.

219
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,041
Uh-uh.
No need.

220
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:01,707
She's ready for you. Sorceress...

221
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,999
Report.
The source of the light

222
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,082
was a girl of 20 annuals.

223
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,582
A girl? Bring her to me.

224
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:19,874
Unfortunately,
there were problems.

225
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,416
Last time complications,
this time problems?

226
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:27,624
She disappeared into the storm
along with her parents.

227
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:33,707
Your storm?
Are you saying they could be here?

228
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,041
Othersiders in the Outer Zone?

229
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:38,374
I am sorry, Sorceress.

230
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,332
You did your best.

231
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,832
(Choking)

232
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,416
(Pants)

233
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,457
(Sighs)

234
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,666
Zero...

235
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,374
You've just been promoted.

236
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,332
If this girl is in the O.Z.,

237
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,499
find her.

238
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:37,041
Will Azkadellia attack from the East?

239
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:38,791
(DG) Who?

240
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:42,916
The sorceress Azkadellia!
The one for whom you spy.

241
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,666
From which direction
will her men come?

242
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:46,249
Will they walk, or will they fly?

243
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,499
OK, how many times
do I have to tell you guys

244
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,374
that nothing you've said
has made any sense to me?

245
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,124
Perhaps she is just a girl.
Yes, I am. I'm just a girl.

246
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,166
Azkadellia has raided most all villages
searching for the stone.

247
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,624
Are we next on her list?

248
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,207
I don't know about any list,
but if this is how you treat strangers,

249
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,624
I'm not surprised you have enemies.

250
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,749
You know what, can you just
please put my locket down?

251
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,124
It has sentimental value.

252
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,291
Our scouts spotted these two
being pursued by Longcoats

253
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,499
on the old brick route to Central City.

254
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,666
Or leading the Longcoats there.

255
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,166
Somebody saw my parents?
You say parents, I say spies.

256
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,624
There's only one way to know
if she speaks truth or lies.

257
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,832
Strap her to the flayer,
and she talks or dies.

258
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,916
Warm up the blades.

259
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:39,624
Squeal as you peel,
till the truth brings a deal.

260
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,499
Hey!

261
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,499
You guys are out of your tiny minds!

262
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,166
What are you doing?
Up here?

263
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:12,291
Little ankle-biters!

264
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:16,291
Thought it would be funny
to keep me hanging around.

265
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,499
Loosen that rope,
and I might have the last laugh.

266
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,499
Come on, doll.

267
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,832
If Mom and Pop really are
on the route to Central City,

268
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,499
you're falling further and further behind.

269
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,582
You know the way?
Sure.

270
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,332
But it's kind of hard
to give directions like this.

271
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,999
Unless you have a better offer.

272
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:49,957
Ah. Ooh. Ooh. Oh.

273
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:52,374
What the hell?

274
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,582
Hey, you aren't so hot
on first glance either, honey.

275
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,166
What, i-is there a problem?
Hm?

276
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:01,207
Oh, um...

277
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,041
Your, uh...

278
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,291
What?

279
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,791
(Chuckles) Your, um...

280
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:10,666
(Hushed) Your zipper's undone.

281
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:13,166
Oh... Didn't mean to offend.

282
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,874
(Chuckles) Got to be careful
not to lose your marbles.

283
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:24,416
But, uh, since the sorceress
made her medicos take mine...

284
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:26,791
Well, you flick the abacus.

285
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:30,207
Why would they
remove your brain?

286
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,374
Because of what I know,

287
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,957
or used to know,

288
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,082
whatever it was.

289
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:45,332
Name's Glitch, on account of sometimes
my synapses don't fire right.

290
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,832
Sometimes my synapses
don't fire right.

291
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,749
You just said that.

292
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,374
Did I? (Laughs)

293
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,332
There you go, glitching again.

294
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,999
And here I was, thinking this nightmare
couldn't get any weirder.

295
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,666
This isn't a nightmare.

296
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:01,499
This is the O.Z.

297
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,082
The Outer Zone.

298
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,416
It used to be a piece of heaven, too.

299
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:09,874
Until Azka D got her claws into it.

300
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,499
Azkadellia!
Hm.

301
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,707
The Sorceress of Darkness.
Yeah.

302
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,416
Village raider. Brain thief.

303
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,166
Longcoats!

304
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:31,832
What are you doing?
I have an idea!

305
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,332
Hello? DG?

306
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,832
It's too... It's too high to jump.

307
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:41,041
I...I really don't think this is a good idea.

308
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:44,416
Come back! Come back right now.

309
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:48,832
Ah!

310
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,666
Come on, we don't have much time!

311
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,041
Wait for me.

312
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,499
DG...

313
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,624
(DG) Come on!

314
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,749
(Glitch) Quick, before they see us!

315
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,874
(DG) Shh!
(Glitch) Hurry! We're safe...

316
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,999
(DG) Oh, look, there's a rope!

317
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:30,207
(Laughing and jeering)

318
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,041
Are you sure you know
the way to Central City?

319
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,332
The shining city on the hill? Sure.

320
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,791
The shining city
on the hill? Sure.

321
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:12,124
The shining city on the hill? Sure.
You're gIitching.

322
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,624
Oh.

323
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,416
My noggin wasn't always this way,
you know.

324
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:22,957
In my heyday,
I was government advisor numero one.

325
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,082
I was the top dog's...

326
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,457
right-hand man.

327
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,666
It would have all been fine,
but her...

328
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:36,999
But her...?

329
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,666
But her...

330
00:26:41,042 --> 00:26:46,791
I would love a fresh ear of corn
with some butter right now, wouldn't you?

331
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:53,124
You said you knew the way
to the old brick route.

332
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,957
Well, of course I do. It's only the main
thoroughfare in all of the O.Z.

333
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:00,999
Why?

334
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:05,374
Because that's the same stump
that you tripped on hours ago.

335
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,499
We've just gone in a big circle.

336
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,499
A circle.

337
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,791
Not again.

338
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,874
The road is around here somewhere.
I-I-I know it.

339
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,791
(Distant thumping, screaming)
Help! Help!

340
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:24,207
You look familiar. Have we met before?
Shh!

341
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,582
(Screaming)
Did you hear that?

342
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,166
Yeah... No.

343
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:33,374
No, no!

344
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:36,124
(Screams)
(Grunts)

345
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,666
(Soldiers laugh)

346
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:39,582
No! No!

347
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:42,499
No! No, no! No!

348
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,624
Those guys are everywhere.

349
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:53,166
Yeah, that's life in the O.Z. these days.
Tough and tougher.

350
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:57,124
(Roaring in pain)
No! Not my boy, leave him alone!

351
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,457
No!
Leave him!

352
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,207
(Grunting)
No!

353
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:05,291
No!
Oh...

354
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:09,874
But even with half a brain,
I can tell that we've got to get out of here.

355
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,666
Oh, cripes.

356
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:19,666
Stop it! Hey!

357
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:21,999
DG, this isn't your fight.

358
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,874
Leave them alone!

359
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,582
What just happened?

360
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,416
(Buzzing and whirring)

361
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,541
What is it?

362
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:48,582
A T.D.E.S.P.H.T.L.

363
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:53,916
Uh... A Tri-Dimensional Energy-Stored
Projected Holographic Time Loop.

364
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:56,166
Nifty little thing.

365
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,874
Hey, I think I invented it.

366
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,291
So, it was all fake?
No.

367
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:04,416
It...it happened, sometime or another.

368
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,541
Why would they have it
playing over and over again

369
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,249
if there was no one here to watch it?

370
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:11,874
Well, I think it...

371
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,582
(Knocks)

372
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:28,916
(Muffled thumping)

373
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:32,249
There's someone in there.
Or something.

374
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,916
(Gasps) Oh!

375
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:08,749
Oh!

376
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,416
Are you OK?

377
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:28,332
Where are they?

378
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,874
(Grunts)

379
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:19,291
I'm going to kill him.

380
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,207
(DG) So he just had
to stand there and watch

381
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:34,332
while his family got tortured
over and over again?

382
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:35,999
The most imaginative tortures

383
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:40,041
are saved for those
who resist Azkadellia.

384
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:48,332
How long were you trapped in there?

385
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:49,832
Since that was a sapling.

386
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:01,832
Much obliged for the help.

387
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:04,416
You're welcome, Mr. Cain.

388
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:08,541
Um, I'm DG, by the way, and this is...
I know, a headcase.

389
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:13,249
(Laughs) I have a proper name, you know.

390
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:18,874
And when I remember it, I will tell you.

391
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,666
(DG) What's a headcase?

392
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:28,166
It's what the state does
to re-educate criminals.

393
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:32,124
They rip out their brains,
make them prisoners of their own minds.

394
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,999
Ain't that right, convict?
Hey, whoa.

395
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,416
I ain't no convict.

396
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:08,291
And just in case I am,
it...it was a bogus charge,

397
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:10,582
a frame-job, I'm sure of it.

398
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,082
Yeah, well...

399
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,999
I'll see you down the road.
Actually, a road is what we're looking for.

400
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,207
We're looking for the Brick route...
Brick route.

401
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,499
..that leads to a place called Central City.
Central City.

402
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:33,499
Do you know of it?
Yeah.

403
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:36,332
It's where Zero was headed after...

404
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:44,791
That's where I'm headed now.
Great! We'll go with you.

405
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:48,874
I got business.
Besides, I don't travel with kids or convicts.

406
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,624
Um, I'm not a kid, and the people who came
to your home came to mine.

407
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,707
I'm just looking for my parents.
And I'm looking for my brain.

408
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,624
And maybe we can help you find...
Maybe you can what? Find what?

409
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,416
My wife? My boy?

410
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,999
They're gone.

411
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:07,416
Probably just like your folks are.

412
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:11,416
(Sighs and growls)

413
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:16,666
Look, nothing personal, kid,
but look at you.

414
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:19,916
First sign of trouble,
you're just going to cut and run.

415
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:24,624
Nothing personal, but when we found you,
you were in a tin box.

416
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,166
You don't know me.

417
00:34:28,292 --> 00:34:31,249
Come on, GIitch,
we'll find the way ourselves.

418
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:33,374
The way?

419
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,166
The way leads through
the fields of the pa-pay.

420
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:40,332
Pa-pay?

421
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:43,916
What?

422
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,582
I've been tossed into a storm,

423
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,541
trussed up by lawn gnomes,

424
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,291
chased by madmen on horseback,

425
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:53,082
how bad can pa-pays be?

426
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:56,999
I've seen them gnaw people in half
Inside 30 seconds.

427
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,582
Zipperhead, keep your mouth shut.
Kid, you stay behind me.

428
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,332
Why the sudden change of heart?

429
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:16,874
Believe me,
heart's got nothing to do with it.

430
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,707
Psst!

431
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:27,166
It came from a young woman.

432
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,832
The othersider.

433
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:34,166
(Sniffs)

434
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:36,291
(Exhales)

435
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:44,916
Do you know who she is?

436
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,832
I will.

437
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,374
Footprints. A few hours old.

438
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,249
One of them's hurt. Right leg's dragging.

439
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,707
That's my dad. One of those guys shot him.

440
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,332
Hey, kiddo.

441
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:05,541
Little heads-up before you lose yours.

442
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:08,707
Runners hate water.
Probably why they smell so bad.

443
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,374
So keep your noses peeled.
When it's time to run, you'll know.

444
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,541
My sinuses are flaring.

445
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:16,832
(Creaking and shrieking)

446
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,832
(Liquid hissing)

447
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:33,207
What's that?

448
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,457
What's what? Ah! Don't touch that!

449
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:38,416
That's a predigestive enzyme
the pa-pay runners use

450
00:36:38,542 --> 00:36:41,041
to tenderize their meat.

451
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,999
Come on, let's go.

452
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:59,207
There's someone in there.
(Moaning)

453
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,832
An advance hunter party
must have snared it.

454
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:04,666
We better get out of here
before their friends come back.

455
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:06,832
We can't just leave him here.

456
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:10,249
You snatch a dinner from a runner,
be prepared to become its replacement.

457
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,666
Let it be.
(Moaning)

458
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:15,082
Oh, the poor thing
must be scared to death.

459
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,957
(Cain) All right, come on.

460
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,332
Let's go.

461
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:21,916
Hey, can I borrow your razor?
(Moaning)

462
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,749
(Roaring)

463
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,624
(Whimpers)

464
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,832
You want that bad attitude
dripping out of your ears?

465
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,582
(Croaking)

466
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:57,082
Aaargh!

467
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,957
Run! Go!

468
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:05,041
Run!

469
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:14,999
Run!
(Shrieking)

470
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:24,832
Run!

471
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:26,957
Go, DG!

472
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,666
(Gunfire)

473
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:35,041
Wrong turn.

474
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,124
(Growling)

475
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,332
Go!
The fall might kill us!

476
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,582
Well, they definitely will!

477
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,832
Whoaaa!

478
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,874
OK, on the count of three. One...

479
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,332
Three!

480
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:00,791
(All scream)

481
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,082
(Gasps)

482
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:14,707
She searches through the East.

483
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,832
Looking for what?

484
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,624
Love.

485
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,082
For those she loves.

486
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:26,874
We need to go, DG!
The Longcoats are after you!

487
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,999
DG?

488
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,999
Get a shovel.

489
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:07,999
You lied to me.

490
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:10,124
She's alive.

491
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,499
How could you do
such a terrible thing?

492
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:16,207
Well, it won't work, you know.

493
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:17,874
She's still a child.

494
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,666
She's here, isn't she? In the O.Z.

495
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:22,957
Tripping over her pigtails
as she wanders in circles.

496
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:24,999
Oh, thank the stars.

497
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,374
What else do you have planned? Hmm?

498
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,082
Nothing, I... There is no plan.

499
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,124
My prison is obviously
a little too comfortable for you.

500
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,916
(Thunderclap)

501
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:44,957
(Shivering)

502
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:04,541
I'll send out my best spies.
No.

503
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:06,249
I'll send out mine.

504
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:34,999
Hey, you want to come
closer to the fire? Warm up?

505
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:39,666
Should have left me to die.

506
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:42,624
Oh, great, a basket case.

507
00:41:56,292 --> 00:41:57,749
(Growls)

508
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:01,374
Stay right there.

509
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,499
It's OK. We're all friends here.

510
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:14,374
You are sad.

511
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,082
Miss your mother

512
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:21,082
and father.

513
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,707
They miss you.

514
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,416
My name's DG. What's yours?

515
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:42,916
"Raw."

516
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,249
Well, it's certainly to the point.
(Snarls)

517
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,999
You're injured.

518
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:57,291
He's a viewer.

519
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,999
Viewers are like psychics,
but instead of seeing with their minds,

520
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,416
they see with their hearts.

521
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:09,332
Azkadellia abducts his kind,

522
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:13,166
gets her alchemists to suck
the second sight right out of their heads.

523
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,791
He could be a big help.

524
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:17,541
Look, I don't know
where you came from,

525
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:20,124
but if you have any interest
in staying alive in the O.Z.

526
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,666
you better get one fact straight
real fast.

527
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:25,832
Trust no one.

528
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:33,874
(Groans in pain)

529
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,499
Let's hope those runners
don't have fang pox.

530
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:42,416
(Cain) Oh!

531
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,541
Heal wound.

532
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:52,207
Soothe.

533
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:55,499
What are you doing?
Hey, wait, wait, wait... Ah!

534
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:09,166
Brave man.

535
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:13,499
Good man.

536
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,624
Tin man.

537
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:19,124
Oh, I might have known
you were a tin man.

538
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,249
What with that attitude. (Scoffs)
What's a tin man?

539
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:26,041
It's what they call policemen
in Central City.

540
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:29,999
At least I think it is.
You're a cop?

541
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:35,916
Was. Until Zero found out
I was part of the resistance.

542
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:39,374
You saw the rest.

543
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:47,666
Thanks.

544
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,832
I picked up your parents' trail
to the West.

545
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,832
(Grunts)

546
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,999
(Squeals)

547
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,416
Good work, my Xora.

548
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:20,582
I knew my oldest friend
would never fail me.

549
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:28,999
You called for me?

550
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:33,166
She's near the fields of the pa-pay.

551
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:40,541
Hey, how about a pit stop, Cain?

552
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:42,499
No time.
(Sighs)

553
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:46,999
Oh, come on, Tin Man, have a heart.

554
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,832
I'm a thinker, not a hiker.

555
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:53,666
Yeah, we could all use a rest.

556
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,916
(Sighs)

557
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:30,082
Don't forget, all of life's answers...

558
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:32,707
Are found along the old road, l remember.

559
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,499
"All of life's answers
are found along the old road."

560
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:41,374
Did you just say old road?

561
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,874
That's what the locals call
the brick road.

562
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,999
I thought you said
you'd never been here before.

563
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:49,124
I haven't been here...before...

564
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:53,416
but I know this place.

565
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:31,832
The spinner in Milltown
was never as complicated as this.

566
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:35,207
No matter where we find ourselves,

567
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:36,957
home is where your heart is.

568
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:39,791
All my dad's stories...

569
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:44,374
My parents were from here.

570
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:53,582
What happened here?

571
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,999
Milltown's been erased.
Azkadellia's term for cleansing history.

572
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:05,332
Uh-oh. We shouldn't be here.

573
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:08,332
No humans allowed.

574
00:48:09,292 --> 00:48:11,207
DG!
What?

575
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:13,332
(Townsfolk muttering)

576
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:18,499
Oh, hey, guys.
Uh, we were just passing through.

577
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:22,416
We were just passing through.
We were just passing th...

578
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:24,999
(Woman) Who are they?

579
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:27,666
(Electrical chirping)

580
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:36,374
Stoke the pyre!
(Townsfolk) Yeah!

581
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:43,166
Pyre? Can we talk about this?

582
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:52,166
Azkadellia's invaders
must be made an example of!

583
00:48:52,292 --> 00:48:53,749
What? This is ridiculous.

584
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:57,416
I don't even know
this Azkadellia person.

585
00:48:57,542 --> 00:49:00,791
You who spoke,
what is your name?

586
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:02,624
DG.

587
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,249
Your voice patterns are familiar.

588
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,374
I've never been here before.

589
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:13,207
Hey, don't let him confuse you, baby girl.
Dad!

590
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:15,874
He's just a crazy old cyborg.
(All laughing)

591
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,707
Oh, I was scared I'd never see you again.

592
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:20,624
Oh! How's your leg?

593
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,332
Everything's OK now you're here.

594
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:25,291
I can't believe that this is your home.

595
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:26,791
Not just ours.

596
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:29,666
You know how you felt like
you never fit in on the other side?

597
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:32,082
What do you mean?

598
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:35,874
Well, that voice Father Vue recalled, um...

599
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,207
was your mother's.

600
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:38,832
It's your voice?

601
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:43,499
Not mine. Your real mother's.

602
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,124
We are series 1487...

603
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:51,416
nurture units.

604
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:57,957
Um, nurture units?

605
00:49:58,083 --> 00:50:00,249
We were programmed
with specific protocoIs

606
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:02,416
to love and protect you
like you were our own.

607
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:05,832
OK, that's weird. Um...
You're robots?

608
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:09,707
Oh, my life is a lie!

609
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:14,416
It wasn't a lie to us.
We...we feel like your parents, DG.

610
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:16,207
We love you.

611
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:20,707
But our deeper purpose
was to tell you the stories of our world,

612
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:23,832
stories that would
prepare you for your return.

613
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,832
My return?

614
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,916
When you started having the dreams,

615
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:32,374
we knew it was time for you
to come back to the Zone,

616
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,124
but the Longcoats came
before we could explain.

617
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:39,207
I'm from here?

618
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:42,332
Our final task was to bring you
to Father Vue.

619
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:46,541
He can tell you how to find your real mother.

620
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:54,249
15 annuals past,
Milltown was the jewel of the O.Z.

621
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:57,832
During that time, a beautiful woman
in a dark cloak came to me,

622
00:50:57,958 --> 00:51:00,374
her spirit full of dread.

623
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,916
She'd just lost her husband,

624
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:04,957
feared losing her child, too.

625
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:08,207
A girl child she called DG.

626
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:27,457
That's the woman from my dreams,
the one with the lavender eyes.

627
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,374
That's... that's my mother?

628
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,416
She was so weak and frightened,

629
00:51:31,542 --> 00:51:34,541
I'm not sure how she found
the strength to go on.

630
00:51:34,667 --> 00:51:37,666
So afraid that...she'd be discovered,

631
00:51:38,542 --> 00:51:40,499
that we'd be discovered.

632
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:43,541
Doing what?
Saving you.

633
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,082
By trusting you to us.

634
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:50,166
Upon your return, your mother
tasked me to give you something.

635
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:04,499
(Gasps)

636
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:15,916
She wants it to guide you
on your journey.

637
00:52:16,042 --> 00:52:20,707
Let it connect you to the light,
connect you to her.

638
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:25,291
Longcoats are coming.
We're running out of time.

639
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:27,791
(Horses whinnying)
Where can I find my mother?

640
00:52:27,917 --> 00:52:29,166
I know not.

641
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:34,041
But there is a man in the Central City
who has all the answers.

642
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:38,041
He's smart, magical, powerful.

643
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:39,957
Some even say he's a wizard.

644
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:42,582
The Mystic Man.
Yes.

645
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:45,374
You know him?
I worked his protection detail for a time.

646
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,916
He's a good man. Come on.
But...

647
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:49,832
Wait! Please come with us.

648
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,416
We can't, honey, our place is here.
You have to go.

649
00:52:52,542 --> 00:52:54,374
We are so proud of you.

650
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,541
I love you both.

651
00:52:56,667 --> 00:52:59,166
I'm sorry, kid, we got to go.
Bye!

652
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:05,582
Quickly, this way.

653
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:07,707
(Men shouting)

654
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:13,707
How much does she know?

655
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,624
It doesn't have to be like this
for either of you, you know.

656
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,666
I mean, we could all be friends.

657
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:28,999
How?
Big changes are planned.

658
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:33,291
You could play an important part
in the future of the O.Z.

659
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:36,999
Or you could be a verse in a song.

660
00:53:38,417 --> 00:53:40,416
It's your choice.

661
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,249
I wonder why my mother abandoned me.

662
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:53,291
Maybe not her fault.
She was weak, maybe sick.

663
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:55,916
Shh! No, I'm sure she's fine.

664
00:53:56,042 --> 00:54:00,416
Probably waiting somewhere for DG
with a warm cup of muglug.

665
00:54:00,542 --> 00:54:01,666
(Giggles)

666
00:54:01,792 --> 00:54:04,166
It's a soup.
Something wonderful from my world.

667
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:05,749
All right, let's pick up the pace.

668
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:08,166
I want some space between us
and the Longcoats by sundown.

669
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:11,041
You know, Cain, I understand
why you're afraid of the dark,

670
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:13,374
what with being locked up
for all those years.

671
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:19,041
But come on! Relax! It's a beautiful day,
there's a rainbow in the sky,

672
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:20,957
and we're nearly at the pot of gold.

673
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:23,832
Wait for me.
We're not in Central City yet.

674
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:26,249
You know what your problem is, Cain?

675
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:28,749
You're always fightin' the tide.

676
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:32,332
Always making yes a no and good a bad.

677
00:54:33,292 --> 00:54:37,499
I've been thinkin'. If Mystic Man
really does have all the answers,

678
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:40,124
then maybe, after
he's helped DG find her mom,

679
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,332
he could help me refill my noggin.

680
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:45,082
Give Raw here some spine.

681
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:49,166
And maybe do something for you
about your lousy attitude!

682
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:51,832
Well, maybe he can put a zipper
where it'll do some good.

683
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,457
(Glitch) Come on, come on!

684
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:10,582
There it is!

685
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:23,832
The shining city on the hill
is starting to tarnish.

686
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,541
(Glitch) This isn't going nearly as well
as I thought it would.

687
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,749
(DG gasps)

688
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:39,207
Looking for resistors.

689
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,166
This is a nightmare.

690
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:46,374
We're going to need some help.

691
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:49,541
(♪ Jaunty music)

692
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:59,166
Central City people, gather round!

693
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:03,291
Antoine Demilo is back in town! Ha-ha!

694
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:04,749
I don't believe it.

695
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:07,332
Gratification collected
from near and far

696
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:09,707
will be available, at reasonable rates,

697
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:12,916
inside the gate in the Sin District square.

698
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,749
Hey, you, with the stupid hat!

699
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:24,041
Move it, will ya?
I got commerce to commence here.

700
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,249
Wyatt freakin' Cain.

701
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:32,874
I thought they were
pissin' on your grave.

702
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,541
I see you're moving up in the world.

703
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:36,957
How's the sleaze business, Demilo?

704
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:39,041
Well, since you've been gone,
biz is booming,

705
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,749
so if you don't mind,
I'm working here, a'ight?

706
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,832
(Growls)
Aah!

707
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:47,957
So am I.

708
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:49,832
Hey, you're not sportin' tin no more,

709
00:56:49,958 --> 00:56:53,624
So leave go me before
I call the nice Longcoats over there

710
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,832
and request that they bloody
your personage!

711
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:59,374
Who needs tin when you have
a picture of a certain little man

712
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,249
playing bedsheet bingo
with Zero's first wife?

713
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:05,874
What? Come on, Cain.

714
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,749
That... Me and Mrs. Z,
w-we was just joking around, that's all.

715
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:12,499
Oh, really? Why don't I go ask Zero,
see if he thinks it's funny?

716
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:16,457
Whoa! Please have a heart.
The guy'll flay me like a Munchkin!

717
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:20,499
He won't have to, if you get us inside,
and tell me where I can find Zero.

718
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:22,541
What are you gunning for Zero for?

719
00:57:22,667 --> 00:57:24,249
That's a short hop to a deep grave.

720
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:26,416
You don't know the half of it.

721
00:57:26,542 --> 00:57:28,374
Are you going to help us?

722
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,291
No.
Really?

723
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:32,249
Yeah.
OK.

724
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:36,332
(Screams) OK!
Mm-hm?

725
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:38,541
Tonight's his weekly shack-up. Aaah!

726
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:40,249
OK.
Ooh. Ah. Oh...

727
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:41,874
That was easy, wasn't it?

728
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,957
Oh, God, I hate tin men,

729
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,832
Especially ex-tin men.

730
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:48,957
Get your mutts in the wagon.

731
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:56,707
City people, gather round!

732
00:57:56,833 --> 00:58:01,416
Antoine Demilo is back in town! Ha-ha!

733
00:58:01,542 --> 00:58:05,416
Gratification collected from near and far...
Drive through. Through!

734
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:09,249
Stand aside. Stand aside.

735
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:53,207
Good driving, Ma.

736
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:55,666
OK, we're in.

737
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:06,374
OK, where can we find
the Mystic Man?

738
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,124
Excuse me,
is there a sign on my back,

739
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,666
"Central City
Taxi And Tourist Information?"

740
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:13,374
Oh! Ow! OK, all right.

741
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,499
All right.

742
00:59:15,917 --> 00:59:18,541
So, the Mystic Man.
That's who you come here for?

743
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:20,749
Is he still in Central City?

744
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:22,374
Oh, he's here all right.

745
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,957
He's just not holding court
where he used to.

746
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:27,041
Ah! Ooh!

747
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:31,332
These'll get you front row seats.
All right?

748
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,499
You can't go dressed like that, cupcake.

749
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:38,791
Maybe my girls can find you something.

750
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:41,166
Then find her something.
Ah!

751
00:59:41,917 --> 00:59:44,582
Now, look. The Mystic Man'll
have all your answers.

752
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:46,749
You don't need me anymore.

753
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:50,749
Don't go after Zero.
You're not a killer, you're a tin man.

754
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:52,666
I told you I'd get you here, and I did.

755
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:55,666
You take care of yourself, kid.

756
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:11,332
So these are the precious parents?

757
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:12,916
Where's your darling girl?

758
01:00:14,917 --> 01:00:17,416
You ran the coercion virus
on their CPUs?

759
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:20,666
They told us everything,
and don't even remember.

760
01:00:21,542 --> 01:00:26,582
Apparently, the girl went to retrieve
a message held by the Mystic Man.

761
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,957
My gods.

762
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:33,666

Question.

783
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:13,999
(Man) Mystic Man, answer me this.

784
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:15,749
What is the meaning of life?

785
01:02:15,875 --> 01:02:22,582
The answer to that question
is as timeless as the moons.

786
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:28,166
We must serve
the forces of the universe...

787

(Audience gasping)

788
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:35,082
..with all our humanity
and all our humility.

789
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:41,374
First, we must inhale...
(Audience sighing)

790
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,832
..the magic.

791
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:45,957
(Glitch) This is the man
with all the answers?

792
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:48,124
What's wrong with him?

793
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:51,832
And hold it!

794
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:53,541
He's out of his mind!

795
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:55,416
Literally.

796
01:02:55,542 --> 01:02:57,541
Hold it!

797
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:03,541
And you know the meaning of life!

798
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:05,999
(Laughter)

799
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:14,832
Inhale the magic?

800
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,457
Azkadellia's vapors.

801
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:21,207
A magic mist that contains a spell of bliss.

802
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:24,624
He doesn't know if he's up or down.

803
01:03:26,667 --> 01:03:28,666
(Raw) I'm sorry, DG.

804
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,332
Hi.

805
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,749
How you doin'?

806
01:03:47,917 --> 01:03:49,457
Wait.

807
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,249
You know what I like...

808
01:03:58,375 --> 01:03:59,624
(Laughs)

809
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:02,416
Well, I know what you like,

810
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,999
so just relax...

811
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,749
and I'll make all your dreams come true.

812
01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:13,582
Where's Zero?
Got to go.

813
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,041
You just missed him.
He busted out of here pronto,

814
01:04:18,167 --> 01:04:21,582
something about some girl
being smuggled into the city.

815
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:45,124
Cover the back.

816
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:56,707
Lock this place down.
They don't leave.

817
01:04:56,833 --> 01:04:58,832
Check upstairs.

818
01:05:03,458 --> 01:05:05,082
Seen her?

819
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:06,624
No?

820
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:09,666
Hey, there's that guy
who locked up Cain.

821
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:12,707
We go now.
We've got to get out of here.

822
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:15,457
No, I'm not leaving
until I get my answers.

823
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:17,582
(Woman screaming)

824
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,541
(Man) Sorry, I don't know.

825
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,707
Have you seen this girl?

826
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:24,749
I think she's at Demilo's table.

827
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:38,707
(Grunting and groaning)

828
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:40,416
(Knock on door)

829
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:42,541
Come in. Come in!

830
01:05:43,417 --> 01:05:45,416
Oh!
(Door opens)

831
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:48,041
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Hi.

832
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:52,499
Yes, come in, yes.
Can I, uh... Can I ask you a question?

833
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:07,874
Yeah, she's down at the end of the hall.

834
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,707
Room number two.

835
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:19,082
Shh...

836
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:33,666
Find Zero.

837
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:39,541
Drop it, or I'll blow you into next week.

838
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:49,624
I thought you weren't
a tin man anymore.

839
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:52,416
We got to go.
We can't.

840
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:54,499
He's not well.

841
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:56,707
Who's not well?

842
01:06:58,708 --> 01:07:00,374
Oh, my.

843
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:04,999
That's not the Mystic Man I remember.

844
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:08,166
Azkadellia's really messed him up.

845
01:07:09,042 --> 01:07:11,041
She's got him on the vapors.

846
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:15,041
Hey...

847
01:07:17,042 --> 01:07:20,499
Look, until this wears off, you're going
to have to hurt for a while, OK?

848
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:24,082
I need answers now.
It would be the vapors talking, not him.

849
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,332
Do you think Zero's going to wait?

850
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,707
Sir? Sir, sir...

851
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:34,624
You have some answers...
Answers?

852
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,749
Yes.
Sure.

853
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:41,541
Many years ago, you helped a woman
smuggle a child out of the O.Z.

854
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:44,374
Out of the O.Z. Yes. Yes.
Yes, yes.

855
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,166
Out of the O.Z. Yes!
Yes. I was that child.

856
01:07:47,292 --> 01:07:48,874
Right.

857
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,374
So you have to help me find out
where my mother is,

858
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,416
who my mother is.
Um...

859
01:07:54,542 --> 01:07:57,082
A woman, uh, um...

860
01:07:57,208 --> 01:08:00,957
Women are great. (Laughs)

861
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,874
No, uh... I remember, um...

862
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,541
I remember who...who, um... Who...

863
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:06,874
My mother.
Who?

864
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,749
Who?
My mother.

865
01:08:08,875 --> 01:08:09,999
Whose mother?
My mother.

866
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:11,666
Whose mother? Oh!

867
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:14,999
Oh! I'm sorry.

868
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:34,582
You have the most brilliant
beautiful blue eyes.

869
01:08:35,667 --> 01:08:37,457
But your mother...

870
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:41,499
Your mother had lavender.

871
01:08:42,667 --> 01:08:44,666
You do remember.

872
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:49,249
OK, kiddo, we got
to get out of here right now.

873
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:52,832
Not now, Mr. Cain. He hasn't told us
where to find my mother.

874
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:54,791
Cain?

875
01:08:54,917 --> 01:08:56,874
(Wheezing)

876
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,707
Cain, you were one of mine,

877
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:01,207
weren't you?

878
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:02,582
A tin man.

879
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:05,207
A long time ago.

880
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:08,416
I'll talk to you later.

881
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,832
Psst! Psst!

882
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,457
Please...
The Northern Island.

883
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:17,832
The Northern Island.
Your journey for her,

884
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:20,749
to find who you are, starts there.

885
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:36,082
Let this guide you.
OK.

886
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:38,832
All right, you two, get those two out of here.
Let's go, let's go.

887
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:40,582
No, no, no.
Let's go. Go!

888
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:43,582
No, you stay with her at all costs.
I have to take care of Zero.

889
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:45,957
You know who she is now.

890
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:47,916
She's the key.

891
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:51,207
Promise me.

892
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:53,374
I want your word as a tin man...

893
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:57,666
you will not leave her side
at any cost.

894
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:03,166
You have my word.

895
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:19,374
(Grunting)

896
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,041
(Snoring)
Wakey wakey, sunshine.

897
01:10:32,167 --> 01:10:34,916
(Demilo) Go away, we're closed.

898
01:10:35,042 --> 01:10:36,124
(Snores)

899
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,832
Ow! I said back off, moron.

900
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:42,916
Class act, Demilo.

901
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:46,666
Cain, what do you want?

902
01:10:46,792 --> 01:10:50,166
Thanks for the ride.
Whoa! How can you do this to me?

903
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:52,791
I have a wife and children.
This is my wagon!

904
01:10:52,917 --> 01:10:54,041
How do you start this thing?

905
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,957
Oh, you gotta pull the knob out,
and then twist the red thing.

906
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:59,082
(Engine starts)

907
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,666
Thank you.
This is my wagon!

908
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:03,749
Cain!

909
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:06,624
Cain, I'm talking to you! Cain, I...

910
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:09,582
Hey! That's my wagon!

911
01:11:16,167 --> 01:11:20,207
How is it that a young, unarmed girl
in a party dress

912
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:23,332
eludes the toughest division in my army?

913
01:11:25,292 --> 01:11:27,082
She wasn't alone.

914
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:29,207
She was helped by...

915
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:34,332
Wyatt Cain, one of the Mystic Man's tin men.

916
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,624
Bring him in.

917
01:11:39,792 --> 01:11:41,791
(Snaps fingers)

918
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:56,416
If it isn't the great and terrible

919
01:11:56,542 --> 01:12:00,041
blah, blah, blah himself.

920
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:04,582
What are you up to, old man?

921
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:05,999
Huh?

922
01:12:07,875 --> 01:12:10,166
A little scent.

923
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:13,541
A little whiff.

924
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:16,166
Oh, you don't fool me.
Please?

925
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:21,499
Please. Please.

926
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:25,624
(Laughs)

927
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,749
Why did she come to see you? Hm?

928
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:31,791
What did you give her?

929
01:12:38,792 --> 01:12:41,082
Hook him up.

930
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:58,374
(Crashing)

931
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,082
What was that?
I don't know.

932
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:05,707
You all right?
Yeah, just freezing.

933
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:07,832
You stay here.

934
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:21,666
Bah!

935
01:13:30,292 --> 01:13:32,291
Oh, what now?

936
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:36,374
Broke axle.
No kidding.

937
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,832
Come on, let's go. We're walking.

938
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,666
What we're looking for is over there!

939
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:06,291
Ice mountain?
That's the Northern Island?

940
01:14:06,417 --> 01:14:09,457
Well, I know it's
around here somewhere.

941
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:13,832
"Frozen in time in a sea of ice,"

942
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:15,832
just like my dad said it would be.

943
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,374
What?

944
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:21,707
Come on, let's go.

945
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,666
The microcosm is expanded

946
01:14:33,792 --> 01:14:36,291
by a single bead of sweat

947
01:14:36,417 --> 01:14:38,332
dropped on a pinhead

948
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:40,749
and spun into a million universes,

949
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:44,124
until it is converted
into the elixir of the gods...

950
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,207
He's masking.
Then...

951
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:48,457
LyIo see too much!
..and only then, can longing,

952
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:51,541
great and passionate longing
reach fulfillment.

953
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:54,499
Lylo see too much!
My fingers, extended to the stars...

954
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:57,457
Focus, Lylo, don't let him sway you.
..seen and unseen in the darkness,

955
01:14:57,583 --> 01:14:59,874
becomes merely a flicker
in the light of the storm,

956
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,624
a glimpse of heaven,
fierce and beautiful and unfiltered...

957
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,832
(Lylo yelps)

958
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:23,666
Pain...

959
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:27,166
Where is she?

960
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:30,166
So much pain.

961
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:33,416
Move beyond the pain.

962
01:15:37,167 --> 01:15:44,999
(Gasps)

963
01:15:50,917 --> 01:15:53,041
The Northern Island.

964
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:57,791
She's going to see Mummy.

965
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:10,041
Dig!
Dig?

966
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:13,082
What do you mean, dig?
Wait, wait.

967
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:19,582
"The daughter of light came upon
a glistening white mountain,

968
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:22,374
"frozen in time in a sea of ice.

969
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,874
"Above all else she knew that...

970
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,582
"that this mountain
was more than it appeared.

971
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,832
"It was home."

972
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,541
(Laughs)

973
01:16:58,292 --> 01:16:59,749
Is it locked?

974
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:03,332
My mother was the queen?

975
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:07,666
That makes you princess.

976
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,874
You knew my mother.

977
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:21,041
I knew I wasn't an idiot.
Or a convict.

978
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:23,416
I was the queen's advisor.

979
01:18:26,667 --> 01:18:29,207
"The queen sat...

980
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:34,499
"gazing hopefully out
upon her frozen realm...

981
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:41,666
"longing for her daughter to return."

01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:44,541
DG, wait.

983
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:09,707
Sad...

984
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,457
Mother waited.

985
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:13,582
Couldn't stay.

986
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:23,416
(Sighs)

987
01:19:23,542 --> 01:19:27,541
There is something
so familiar about this.

988
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:33,166

989
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,041
No.

Bad things happened here.

991
01:19:44,292 --> 01:19:47,791
What bad things?
We go. We go now.

992
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:49,999
No. No, I need to know.

993
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:52,499
Raw, please.

994
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,166

(Whimpers)

996
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,541
Tell her.

997
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,499
Look.

you will return.

You're my sister.

DG...the little sister
I thought I no longer had.

1043
01:24:06,042 --> 01:24:07,957
I've always wondered
what you'd look like.

1044
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:10,166
Leave her alone.

1045
01:24:11,042 --> 01:24:13,374
What do you want?
Well, up until a moment ago,

1046
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:14,707
I wanted your death.

1047
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:18,832
Hm! But now it seems
you have something I need.

1048
01:24:20,917 --> 01:24:24,416
What?
The emerald. You know where it is.

1049
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,291
Don't tell me you
haven't dreamed of it,

1050
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:32,041
heard it calling to you, begging to be found
from its dark hiding place.

1051
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:33,749
No, I haven't.
No?

1052
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:35,999
No.

1053
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:41,249
What did she whisper in your ear?

1054
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:43,291
I don't remember.

1055
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:45,332
That's a shame.

1056
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,874
How can I tell you what I don't know?

1057
01:24:56,417 --> 01:24:58,374
DG, where are you?

1058
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,082
Mother?

What have you done with her?

1061
01:25:11,417 --> 01:25:13,999
Put her away for safe-keeping.

1062
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:16,041
Like any good daughter would.

1063
01:25:16,167 --> 01:25:17,624
Where?

1064
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:20,999
Somewhere you will never find her.

1065
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,707
Go! Go!

1066
01:25:41,542 --> 01:25:42,999
Wait!

1067
01:25:56,208 --> 01:25:58,207
Bring her to me.

1068
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:03,707
(Shrieking)

1069
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:17,374
(Shrieking and snarling)

1070
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:54,874
Now I know why they call you Zero.
Still can't fight your own battles.

1071
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,041
I do my share.

1072
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:05,041
(Gasping)

1073
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:07,166
(Shrieking and chirping)

1074
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:26,749
DG!

1075
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:34,791
(Whimpering)

1076
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:36,916
(Squawking)

1077
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:40,749
Bring him.

1078
01:28:06,042 --> 01:28:08,041
(Screams)

1079
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:12,166
Put me down!

1080
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:48,541
No iron suit for you this time.

1081
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:53,999
No wife and child

1082
01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:57,707
crying for years
to free you from it.

1083
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:59,457
My family's alive?

1084
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:01,499
Hardly matters now.

1085
01:29:01,625 --> 01:29:03,041
(Chuckles)

1086
01:29:08,208 --> 01:29:09,374
(Shouts)

1087
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:13,332
(Screaming)

1088
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:45,832
Glitch!

1089
01:29:56,292 --> 01:29:57,666
Ah!

1090
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:03,582
Welcome back, little sister.

1091
01:30:05,792 --> 01:30:08,541
There's no place like the O.Z.
