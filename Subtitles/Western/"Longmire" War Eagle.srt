1
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:44,709
[truck door closes]

2
00:00:47,762 --> 00:00:49,805
You said you found something?

3
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:55,261
There was dirt in a shell inside the
shotgun Branch used to kill himself.

4
00:00:58,314 --> 00:00:59,815
How does that happen?

5
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:05,737
Whoever fired the shotgun must've
ejected the shell, probably out of habit.

6
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:07,739
That created a problem.

7
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,950
Now it doesn't look like a suicide.

8
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:12,327
Because a dead man could
not eject his own shell.

9
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:17,791
So, Branch's killer picked up the,
uh, spent shell off the ground,

10
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:21,545
put it back in the shotgun.

11
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:24,172
[Henry] And then stages the scene.

12
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:25,799
[Walt] Yeah.

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,885
So...

14
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:32,764
I need to see if the dirt from
here matches the dirt in the shell.

15
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:39,187
If it doesn't, that proves
that the body was moved.

16
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:42,315
You think Nighthorse did all of this?

17
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:45,027
I do, and he knows that I do.

18
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:49,280
He came by my cabin with a few
dozen friends, just as a warning.

19
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:52,777
- [static]
- [Ruby] Walt? Walt, you there?

20
00:01:57,957 --> 00:01:58,874
Yep.

21
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,458
Couple of spooked kids just called in.

22
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,828
They were out drinking and heard voices.

23
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:09,509
That might be outside my jurisdiction.

24
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:14,048
They said they heard Asian
voices, Walt, out by War Eagle.

25
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,642
Thanks, Ruby.

26
00:02:17,643 --> 00:02:20,104
I'll head out at first light.

27
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:22,064
[Henry] First light?

28
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:25,559
Why not drive to War Eagle
now while it is still dark?

29
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:29,404
It's a two-hour drive, and I'm busy.

30
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:32,741
I could go with you, perhaps
hold your hand this time.

31
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:34,743
I wasn't that afraid.

32
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:37,780
- You whimpered.
- I was 12.

33
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:40,290
Fine.

34
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,243
I'll do it.

35
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:47,798
I can't think what else to do
about Branch's murder right now

36
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:51,919
except get these soil samples analyzed.

37
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:55,798
You can do that a lot faster than I can.

38
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:59,101
My botanist friend at the university.

39
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:00,477
Can you call in a favor?

40
00:03:00,478 --> 00:03:02,763
Sure.

41
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:10,654
- What is this for?
- I need to deputize you.

42
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:14,532
Make sure the chain of custody is airtight.

43
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,077
I don't want Nighthorse wriggling
out from under a murder charge

44
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:18,404
on some technicality.

45
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:29,374
Whose badge is this?

46
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:32,793
Branch's.

47
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:47,451
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

48
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,040
As soon as Henry gets those, uh, soil
samples tested, patch him through.

49
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,124
Thanks, Ruby.

50
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,876
Those tests take weeks.

51
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:07,745
[Walt] Henry knows someone.

52
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:12,132
- So, where are we headed to again?
- War Eagle.

53
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:14,968
[Vic] And what is that,
a Cheyenne ghost town?

54
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:17,221
Ruby said it might be haunted.

55
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:21,967
It's a former World War II internment
camp for Japanese Americans.

56
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,123
[Vic] You been here before?

57
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:46,374
[Walt] Once.

58
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,668
[Vic] You hear voices?

59
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:51,421
Henry claimed he heard some whimpering.

60
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:53,131
I don't believe him, though.

61
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:55,084
[chuckles]

62
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:04,469
Looks like those teens did
more than just hear voices.

63
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:13,193
What is it?

64
00:05:13,194 --> 00:05:14,937
Amateur radio tower.

65
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:18,448
Receiver must be inside.

66
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:20,567
That would explain the foreign voices.

67
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,113
- You hope so.
- [Walt] Yeah.

68
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:39,303
Anyone there?

69
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:40,971
[radio chatter]

70
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:42,465
Hello?

71
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:00,324
[man] Hello?

72
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:03,819
Those drunk teens must've
heard the HAM radio last night.

73
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:10,167
Someone's done a lot of
work since I was here last.

74
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:12,752
- [Vic] And when was that?
- [Walt] Seventh grade.

75
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:16,081
So, then everything here
is a historical artifact?

76
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:20,677
Huh.

77
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:22,296
I guess so.

78
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:31,389
Except for this.

79
00:06:33,107 --> 00:06:34,725
Bingo.

80
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,223
Maybe there's I.D. on the body.

81
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:07,592
There's no need.

82
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:10,268
That's Thorvin Hampton.

83
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:12,145
He's been, uh...

84
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:17,059
working here for years trying to renovate
this place, turn it into a memorial.

85
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:21,188
[Vic] Sorry, Walt.

86
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,489
Do you know the family?

87
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,576
I don't know if he's got any left.

88
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:31,248
Both our fathers were VFW drinking buddies.

89
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:34,418
Thorvin was an only child. I
don't think he ever married, so...

90
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,412
[Vic] Smart man.

91
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:41,925
Okay.

92
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:48,090
So, there's no blood, no cuts, no bruising.

93
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,976
There's no visible signs of foul play.

94
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:54,562
Other than being locked inside this room.

95
00:07:54,563 --> 00:07:57,148
What, you think he was killed
somewhere else and dumped here?

96
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:58,858
No.

97
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:00,902
Thorvin was alive when
he was locked in here.

98
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:02,729
Check his fingernails.

99
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:08,618
[Vic] Splinters.

100
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:09,987
[Walt] Yep.

101
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,240
He tried to claw his way out.

102
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,621
- Maybe he had a heart attack.
- Or exposure.

103
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,505
[knocks]

104
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:24,050
When they put up these barracks
quick and cheap back in the '40s,

105
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:25,628
there was no insulation.

106
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:34,602
You know, maybe those drunk
teens break into the donation box,

107
00:08:34,603 --> 00:08:36,229
steal the money.

108
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,273
Hampton catches them
in the act. They panic.

109
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:40,317
They overpower him. They lock him in here.

110
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:41,692
[Walt] Yeah.

111
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:45,155
[Vic] You know, I can
take the lead on this.

112
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:48,908
I'm sure you'd rather, uh, focus on
investigating Branch's murder anyway.

113
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:50,410
[sighs] I would.

114
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:52,404
But I can do both.

115
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:56,124
Why don't you go ahead and track
down those teens that called Ruby,

116
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,084
check their stories.

117
00:08:58,085 --> 00:08:59,828
- You sure?
- I am.

118
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:05,675
I wasn't elected just to solve
crimes when it was convenient.

119
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:06,752
Okay.

120
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:15,886
[sighs]

121
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:29,941
[indistinct conversations]

122
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,383
Hope you're not cruising
around on the company dime.

123
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:47,842
What are you doing out here?

124
00:09:47,843 --> 00:09:50,254
Signing up for night classes.

125
00:09:52,931 --> 00:09:55,933
Employees are like family to Malachi.

126
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:59,396
He doesn't want to see
them making bad decisions

127
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:01,689
or hanging out with shady characters.

128
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,982
Then I better get going.

129
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:07,104
I would not want Malachi to see me
talking to you and get the wrong idea.

130
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:09,147
[engine turns over]

131
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:25,505
Thorvin grew up in this house.

132
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:28,007
He must've moved back in
after his parents died.

133
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:29,717
[radio chatter]

134
00:10:29,718 --> 00:10:31,169
Whoa.

135
00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:44,308
[radio turns off]

136
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:50,738
There's a lot of classic
rigs in this place.

137
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:54,867
That's an '82 Cobra with the original mike.

138
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:56,702
You know your way around this equipment.

139
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:59,163
Remember when my dad used to
drive truck when I was a kid?

140
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:00,457
Yeah.

141
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,875
CB's how he kept in touch.

142
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:04,544
Ah.

143
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:07,422
Looks like Thorvin was in
touch with a lot of folks.

144
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:09,633
[Ferg] CBers tend to be really friendly,

145
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:12,927
but there's a lot of crazy
loners out there, too.

146
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:16,222
Got in this argument when I was
in high school with a trucker

147
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:19,593
about whether Elway or Marino
was a better quarterback.

148
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:22,353
That's a pretty one-sided argument.

149
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:23,647
[Ferg] Not to this guy.

150
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:27,775
Scary thing is, he tracked me down
by monitoring my signal strength.

151
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:28,693
I didn't realize it

152
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:31,362
until he was right behind me
trying to run my car off the road.

153
00:11:31,363 --> 00:11:33,858
What was your handle?

154
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:39,237
High Plains Drifter.

155
00:11:41,707 --> 00:11:45,418
Well, High Plains Drifter,

156
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:50,131
why don't you see if you can reach
any of Thorvin's, uh, recent contacts?

157
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:55,178
Try to refrain from arguing religion,
politics, or AFC quarterbacks.

158
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:58,181
Anything I should be
looking for in particular?

159
00:11:58,182 --> 00:12:02,810
Well, uh, looks like Thorvin's two
passions were radios and history.

160
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:07,857
See if either of them got him
into any heated arguments lately.

161
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:10,901
People don't like to be reminded
about that internment camp.

162
00:12:10,902 --> 00:12:14,197
[Ferg] Why was Thorvin so
interested in War Eagle?

163
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:18,576
I don't know. I do know he was rounding 60.

164
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:22,072
And history gets heavier
the older you get, so...

165
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,000
[cell phone rings]

166
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:26,959
[beep]

167
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,128
Hello?

168
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:30,622
Yeah.

169
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:33,333
Vic.

170
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:34,925
Yeah.

171
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:38,513
So, I talked to the two kids
who called Ruby about the voices.

172
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:41,140
Both admit to being high on
mushrooms and trespassing,

173
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:44,602
but they said they got scared and ran
off before they reached the barracks.

174
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:48,523
They also said that there was
a third kid named Caleb Jacky

175
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:51,184
who did make it all the way up to the camp.

176
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:59,450
[Walt] Vic, you still there?

177
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:01,703
Sean. Sean. Sean.

178
00:13:01,704 --> 00:13:03,580
[breathing heavily]

179
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:05,115
[screams]

180
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:13,874
Vic, you still there?

181
00:13:16,176 --> 00:13:18,094
I think I'm gonna need some backup.

182
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:19,880
Okay.

183
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:25,135
[indistinct shouting]

184
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:29,063
Sorry to drag you all the way out here.
I know you got a lot on your plate.

185
00:13:29,064 --> 00:13:30,314
No, it was smart.

186
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:33,401
Last thing I want is another
deputy putting their life at risk.

187
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:34,402
Which way?

188
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:37,022
[shouting continues]

189
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:45,447
- [crowd cheering]
- [rock music playing]

190
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:48,366
Bring it on, bro!

191
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:06,134
[crowd groans]

192
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:10,681
[indistinct shouting]

193
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:17,062
[cheers and applause]

194
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:26,120
I've re-emerged from the
collective unconscious!

195
00:14:26,121 --> 00:14:28,956
I am everything you fear!

196
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:32,084
I am Nightmare Fuel!

197
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:34,754
[crowd cheering]

198
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:39,550
Who else dares dip into the
dark recesses of the human mind?

199
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:40,752
I do.

200
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:44,180
[Rett] So, what did my
jackass of a son do now?

201
00:14:44,181 --> 00:14:45,931
We were just trying to figure that out.

202
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:47,258
I'll take that, son.

203
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:51,979
So, uh, we talked to your son's
friends Bradley and Spencer,

204
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,273
so we know he was at War Eagle last night.

205
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:55,358
[Rett] War Eagle?

206
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:58,486
You said you were over at Spencer's
watching old Summerslam tapes.

207
00:14:58,487 --> 00:14:59,945
I was.

208
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:03,073
But then I stepped out just
for, like, a minute or two.

209
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:05,201
Did you see anyone while
you were up at the camp?

210
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:08,037
Someone you were worried
might get you in trouble?

211
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:09,747
Caleb.

212
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:13,668
Stand up straight, look them
in the eye, tell the truth.

213
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:17,338
[sighs] We just wanted to explore
the old Jap internment camp

214
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,798
to see if it was really haunted.

215
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,341
We didn't see anything.

216
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:24,220
But we heard some voices, so we
ran out to Spencer's car and left.

217
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:25,471
That's it?

218
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:27,640
Yeah. That's it.

219
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:31,435
Because someone broke in to the War
Eagle donation box and took some money.

220
00:15:31,436 --> 00:15:32,937
You know anything about that?

221
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:34,564
[scoffs] No.

222
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,482
What about the dead body that we found

223
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:38,693
locked in one of the barracks
buildings this morning?

224
00:15:38,694 --> 00:15:40,403
A dead body?

225
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:43,406
I told you I didn't see anything up
there. All I heard were those voices.

226
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:45,449
Are you sure? You seem frightened.

227
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,328
Maybe you put the caretaker in some
kind of sleeper hold, dragged him inside.

228
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:50,955
[Rett] Wait a second.

229
00:15:50,956 --> 00:15:52,874
Thorvin Hampton was the one killed?

230
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,083
You knew him?

231
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:55,835
[Rett] Well, he's hard to miss.

232
00:15:55,836 --> 00:16:00,089
Walking up and down this county picking
at scabs that've been healed for decades.

233
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,675
Think Thorvin might've done
something to get himself killed?

234
00:16:02,676 --> 00:16:05,595
Well, he was provoking people enough.

235
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:09,382
Hear him talk, you'd think
we built Auschwitz up there.

236
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:11,301
We were at war.

237
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,728
Heard of Pearl Harbor?

238
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:16,098
Japanese attacked us.

239
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:18,900
It's hard to know who
was a spy and who wasn't.

240
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:23,404
And those internment camps, they
were for their protection anyway.

241
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:28,443
You ask me, we don't have a
damn thing to apologize for.

242
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:36,459
Sounds like Caleb's father had more of
an interest in going after Thorvin Hampton

243
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,419
than Caleb did.

244
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,089
Find out what you can about the Jackys
and their interactions with Thorvin.

245
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,633
I'll go check the autopsy report.

246
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:46,302
Maybe the body shows signs
of a choke hold or something.

247
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:47,845
Okay.

248
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:49,673
Should probably leave that here.

249
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,851
[bat thuds]

250
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:03,820
Hello, Ruby.

251
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,314
This is Deputy Standing Bear.

252
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:10,034
Could you patch me through
to the sheriff, please?

253
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:12,196
[Ruby] Walt. Got Henry for you.

254
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:15,331
What'd you find out?

255
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:18,292
[Henry] My friend from the
university ran a preliminary test.

256
00:17:18,293 --> 00:17:21,504
The soil type from the creek
bed and from the shotgun shell

257
00:17:21,505 --> 00:17:23,047
do appear to be different.

258
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:24,632
So, the body was moved.

259
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,216
Not necessarily.

260
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:30,638
Apparently different soil types can
exist just feet apart from one another,

261
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:34,475
but the dirt from the shotgun
shell does have pollen in it.

262
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:36,101
What does that mean?

263
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:40,147
It means that we have to wait for my
friend to run another series of tests.

264
00:17:40,148 --> 00:17:42,692
I pushed, but it may take a day or two.

265
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:45,444
Also, you were right to be
concerned about Nighthorse.

266
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:48,656
Darius Burns followed me to the university,

267
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:51,367
which means Malachi's having me followed.

268
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:53,744
At Nighthorse's request, I'm sure.

269
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:55,120
Keep an eye out.

270
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:57,199
I already am.

271
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:20,646
[Alicia] Dear Hector,
they say that you're dead.

272
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:23,399
I don't want to believe that.

273
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,275
My name's Alicia Musgraves.

274
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:28,487
I'm the mother of a
beautiful boy named Louie.

275
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:33,951
I do everything I can to raise him right,
but I have this neighbor, Lane Potter.

276
00:18:33,952 --> 00:18:38,573
He's come over and stolen
money from me twice already.

277
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:44,503
He says that no one will believe me,
though, because I used to be a junkie.

278
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:49,341
Lane Potter has taken $220 from us so far.

279
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:50,801
I don't want you to hurt him.

280
00:18:50,802 --> 00:18:54,298
I just want him to stop.

281
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,218
I still believe that
you're out there, Hector.

282
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:02,555
Nia'ish, Alicia.

283
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:06,810
Mommy. Can I get this?

284
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:17,286
[Alicia] Sweetie, Mommy doesn't
have enough money for all this food.

285
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,621
[Louie] Okay.

286
00:19:18,622 --> 00:19:20,991
[Alicia] I'm gonna have
to put some of it back.

287
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,171
Like, uh, the sprinkle
cheese, the applesauce.

288
00:19:27,172 --> 00:19:28,999
We can put this back, too.

289
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:33,586
[Alicia] I'm so sorry, sweetie.

290
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:39,343
That is a crystal-clear
10-4 there, Sunshine Sally.

291
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:42,428
This here is High Plains Drifter.

292
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:44,981
[Sally] Hey, there, High Plains Drifter.

293
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:47,351
You're coming in big and strong.

294
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:51,654
I'm looking for a 10-35 on a
fella named Thorvin Hampton,

295
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:54,239
also known as, uh, Toe Tapper.

296
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,826
Ah, Toe Tapper.

297
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:58,153
[click]

298
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:13,918
[gunshot]

299
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,812
So, it turns out our father, Rett Jacky,

300
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:27,148
did have a run-in with our
victim a couple months ago

301
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:33,855
in the parking lot of a restaurant called
General Custard's Last Frozen Treat Stand.

302
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:38,701
How bad of a run-in?

303
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:41,370
It was bad enough that we were
called in to settle things down.

304
00:20:41,371 --> 00:20:44,623
I don't remember being called in on that.

305
00:20:44,624 --> 00:20:47,535
Uh, no, you weren't. Um, it was Branch.

306
00:20:49,796 --> 00:20:52,715
And according to Branch's report,

307
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:56,878
Thorvin Hampton complained that Rett
Jacky had been harassing him for weeks.

308
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:02,474
That's Branch's computer, right?

309
00:21:02,475 --> 00:21:03,593
[softly] Yeah.

310
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:06,012
Find anything new?

311
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:07,521
[sighs]

312
00:21:07,522 --> 00:21:13,019
Only his supposed, uh, suicide note,
which we now know he didn't write.

313
00:21:15,113 --> 00:21:19,533
The weird thing about that note is
that it actually does sound like Branch.

314
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:21,569
I mean, crazy Branch, but...

315
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:24,239
Sounds like him.

316
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:34,090
That's because whoever
wrote it knew Branch well.

317
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:36,834
Maybe Nighthorse left us some prints.

318
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:47,937
I just talked with a local CBer

319
00:21:47,938 --> 00:21:51,975
who appears to be the world's leading
expert on the topic of Thorvin Hampton.

320
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:58,447
[Walt] So, I gather you knew him well?

321
00:21:58,448 --> 00:22:00,449
[Sally] Me and Thorvin were soul mates.

322
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,995
Or rather Sunshine Sally and
Toe Tapper were soul mates.

323
00:22:04,996 --> 00:22:07,372
You two talked a lot?

324
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:09,959
We'd chew the rag until the morning hours.

325
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,245
About everything under the sun.

326
00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:17,174
Did Thorvin tell you about his
plans for reopening the camp?

327
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:19,384
Talked about it all the time.

328
00:22:19,385 --> 00:22:23,680
You know, back in the war, his father
was stationed at War Eagle as a guard.

329
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:25,975
How did Thorvin feel about that?

330
00:22:25,976 --> 00:22:27,351
[Sally] Made him sick.

331
00:22:27,352 --> 00:22:31,480
I guess his father and some other
soldiers would even go into orphanages

332
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:35,651
and round up little
Japanese babies for the camp.

333
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:37,111
Babies.

334
00:22:37,112 --> 00:22:39,029
What were they gonna do?

335
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,697
Drool on us to death?

336
00:22:40,698 --> 00:22:42,158
[scoffs]

337
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,702
Is that why he started
the memorial, out of guilt?

338
00:22:45,703 --> 00:22:48,538
That and curiosity about his half-brother.

339
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,958
What half-brother?

340
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:55,296
His father slept with a young Japanese
woman at the camp named Birdie.

341
00:22:55,297 --> 00:22:56,630
She got pregnant.

342
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:59,633
The old man never bothered to
tell Thorvin about his half-brother

343
00:22:59,634 --> 00:23:01,302
till he was on his deathbed.

344
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:02,886
Did Thorvin ever find him?

345
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:05,215
[Sally] If he did, he would've told me.

346
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:08,926
We told each other everything.

347
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:17,185
Put it on the table.

348
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:23,490
Okay, uh, go over the registration records
for any male babies born at War Eagle.

349
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:25,075
See what you can find out.

350
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:26,202
Thanks, Vic.

351
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:27,320
[beep]

352
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:31,081
Want you to head over to Thorvin's house.

353
00:23:31,082 --> 00:23:34,001
He may have some more
secrets we don't know about.

354
00:23:34,002 --> 00:23:35,378
Can you imagine?

355
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:38,297
Somebody comes up to you and
says he's your half-brother.

356
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:42,586
That his father got your mother
pregnant while she was in a prison camp.

357
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:46,471
Is that gonna be a happy family reunion?

358
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:48,466
Not likely.

359
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,761
[indistinct conversations]

360
00:23:58,068 --> 00:23:59,276
[Alicia] Ready to go to class?

361
00:23:59,277 --> 00:24:03,314
[Louie] Yes, I am. I
have my glasses, my lunch.

362
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:02,965
So, I went through the War Eagle records,

363
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:07,086
and there were 25 male children born
there during the time that it was open.

364
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,682
Any of them now living near
Idaho Falls or Pocatello?

365
00:25:12,683 --> 00:25:14,851
[Vic] Um...

366
00:25:14,852 --> 00:25:17,229
A guy named Francis Igawa. Why?

367
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,400
There was a road atlas open to
Idaho Falls in Thorvin's office.

368
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:22,602
Let's start there.

369
00:25:27,949 --> 00:25:31,576
When you were talking to
Francis Igawa's daughter,

370
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:34,955
did she say that Thorvin Hampton
visited them in Idaho Falls?

371
00:25:34,956 --> 00:25:36,499
Yeah.

372
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,877
She mention anything about what
it was about or how it went?

373
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:42,413
Nope.

374
00:25:50,263 --> 00:25:53,633
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

375
00:25:54,642 --> 00:25:58,354
I thought I should wait
till we were alone first.

376
00:25:58,355 --> 00:25:59,972
Really? What?

377
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:02,726
Well...

378
00:26:04,235 --> 00:26:05,402
The bat thing.

379
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:07,863
What bat thing?

380
00:26:07,864 --> 00:26:09,733
[Walt] At the Jacky place.

381
00:26:11,576 --> 00:26:13,577
You've been through a lot lately.

382
00:26:13,578 --> 00:26:15,371
Trauma is...

383
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:17,373
It's complex.

384
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:23,170
If you, uh... you need to talk about
what's been, you know, on your mind,

385
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:26,249
I can, uh, you know...

386
00:26:27,925 --> 00:26:29,759
I can do that sort of thing.

387
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,720
Do you know what's on my mind?

388
00:26:31,721 --> 00:26:35,974
We have access to the entire national
fingerprint database back at the office,

389
00:26:35,975 --> 00:26:38,268
yet you're still sitting
there with a magnifying glass

390
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:41,688
trying to match Nighthorse's prints to the
ones you lifted off of Branch's computer.

391
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:43,648
If you don't want to
talk to me, that's fine,

392
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:48,571
but there are professionals who,
uh, specialize in this sort of thing.

393
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:52,449
Oh, so you're saying that I
shouldn't just rely on myself,

394
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,370
that I should utilize
all available resources.

395
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:59,748
The only reason I'm not
using a digital database

396
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:03,252
is because I don't want to sound alarms
and attract Nighthorse's attention.

397
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:04,461
Right.

398
00:27:04,462 --> 00:27:07,047
Because Nighthorse has
successfully infiltrated

399
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:08,965
and manipulated the federal government

400
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:12,002
on behalf of a secret
Native American agenda.

401
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:14,137
I'm being cautious.

402
00:27:14,138 --> 00:27:16,599
No, you're being paranoid.

403
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,017
We have Nighthorse's prints
from the last time we booked him.

404
00:27:19,018 --> 00:27:22,312
As soon as we get back to the station,
I'm gonna run them through the database.

405
00:27:22,313 --> 00:27:23,230
Fine.

406
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:24,940
Fine.

407
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:27,602
Which is exactly how I feel, by the way.

408
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:29,437
Yeah.

409
00:27:30,614 --> 00:27:33,357
I remember Branch saying
something like that.

410
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:47,254
293 Oak Street, Idaho Falls.

411
00:27:47,255 --> 00:27:50,132
Red door, pear tree.
This looks like the place.

412
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:53,343
If this is Thorvin's half-brother,
he might also be his killer.

413
00:27:53,344 --> 00:27:55,212
We don't know how he might react.

414
00:27:57,348 --> 00:28:00,718
I'll keep cover in case he
decides to flip out or flee.

415
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,553
[knock on door]

416
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:15,532
Mr. Igawa?

417
00:28:15,533 --> 00:28:18,910
I'm Sheriff Walt Longmire from
Absaroka County in Wyoming.

418
00:28:18,911 --> 00:28:20,912
This is Deputy Moretti.

419
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:22,789
You mind if we come in and speak to you?

420
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,541
Thank you. Yes.

421
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:28,337
The sake is ready to be poured.

422
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:33,710
Uh, thank you, but, um, you
don't have to put yourself out.

423
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:37,046
No.

424
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:40,758
[door closes]

425
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:43,393
[Francis shouting in Japanese]

426
00:28:43,394 --> 00:28:44,846
[clattering]

427
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:49,525
Dad?

428
00:28:49,526 --> 00:28:51,276
You okay? What's going on?

429
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:52,611
Uh, Shiori?

430
00:28:52,612 --> 00:28:54,697
Hi. Uh, uh, Deputy Moretti.

431
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:56,198
We spoke on the phone.

432
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:57,616
Oh, right.

433
00:28:57,617 --> 00:28:59,451
Sorry, I lost track of time.

434
00:28:59,452 --> 00:29:02,787
- [clattering]
- [Francis shouting in Japanese]

435
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:04,206
[sighs]

436
00:29:04,207 --> 00:29:07,451
I better check on my dad
before he hurts himself.

437
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:12,881
Dad.

438
00:29:12,882 --> 00:29:15,919
No, I don't know where it's at.

439
00:29:17,178 --> 00:29:18,887
Here.

440
00:29:18,888 --> 00:29:19,888
Try this.

441
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:22,842
Ah! [speaking Japanese]

442
00:29:23,934 --> 00:29:26,429
[continues in Japanese]

443
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:37,030
Dad. They didn't steal anything.

444
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:39,442
I'm sure it's around here somewhere.

445
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:46,081
[speaking Japanese]

446
00:29:46,082 --> 00:29:48,952
It might be better if we speak in my room.

447
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:51,996
[shouting]

448
00:29:57,218 --> 00:29:59,678
[sighs] Forgive the mess.

449
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,972
I work graveyard as an ER nurse,

450
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:07,436
and when I get home,
I pretty much collapse.

451
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:10,773
Do you, uh, take care of
your father all by yourself?

452
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:12,733
I try to.

453
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:15,944
Well, we're sorry for upsetting him.

454
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:17,613
I should apologize.

455
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:21,533
My father's been struggling
with dementia for years,

456
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:23,493
and all of a sudden, he thought you two

457
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:26,204
were the neighborhood
bullies he grew up with.

458
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:30,250
How did your father react
when Thorvin Hampton came here?

459
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:34,630
Uh... polite and welcoming, as always,

460
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:38,842
but then when I stepped into the
kitchen for just, like, a moment,

461
00:30:38,843 --> 00:30:41,219
he started having one of his fits.

462
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,014
Sort of frightened the War Eagle guy away.

463
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:49,136
My father's mind might be slipping,
but he's still as strong as a mule.

464
00:30:50,313 --> 00:30:51,814
Do you know what caused the outburst?

465
00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:53,565
[Shiori] It could've been anything.

466
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:58,903
A childhood memory, a
bluebird flying by the window.

467
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:00,489
You think your father would react badly

468
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,150
if Thorvin Hampton told
him they were half-brothers?

469
00:31:05,077 --> 00:31:06,737
Wait, what?

470
00:31:08,498 --> 00:31:11,082
I think you must be mistaken.

471
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:15,120
This man just wanted to ask
for donations for his camp.

472
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,675
Besides, he was white.

473
00:31:19,676 --> 00:31:24,179
Thorvin Hampton's father was a
guard at War Eagle during the war.

474
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,014
Apparently, this guard had an affair

475
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:29,309
with a Japanese-American
woman at the camp,

476
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:35,516
and then the woman became pregnant
with your father, we believe.

477
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:40,980
What was this woman's name?

478
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:43,440
Birdie.

479
00:31:44,742 --> 00:31:46,402
Oh.

480
00:31:50,414 --> 00:31:53,124
That explains so much.

481
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,078
How so?

482
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,509
My grandparents have always been
an off-limits topic for my father.

483
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:06,005
I mean, he wouldn't even
stand for me to bring it up.

484
00:32:08,182 --> 00:32:11,727
- Did this Mr. Hampton send you here?
- No.

485
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:13,812
Is he afraid to come back?

486
00:32:13,813 --> 00:32:18,475
No, uh, unfortunately, someone
recently killed Thorvin Hampton.

487
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:23,906
It appears that your father
is his closest living kin.

488
00:32:23,907 --> 00:32:25,524
So, we drove out to notify him.

489
00:32:27,117 --> 00:32:28,569
Oh.

490
00:32:29,704 --> 00:32:32,163
Uh, well...

491
00:32:32,164 --> 00:32:34,290
I guess you could try to do that,

492
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:36,660
but I don't know how much he'll understand.

493
00:32:40,631 --> 00:32:43,425
So, you did know Thorvin...
I mean, Toe Tapper.

494
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:45,510
[man] Everyone knows Toe Tapper, hombre.

495
00:32:45,511 --> 00:32:48,631
Hell of a stand-up guy.
Shame what happened.

496
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:51,892
He ever mention anything about any enemies?

497
00:32:51,893 --> 00:32:53,769
Anything about a half-brother?

498
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:58,106
Sounds like you need to get in touch
with Sunshine Sally over on channel 19.

499
00:32:58,107 --> 00:33:00,525
If there was anything
haywire, he would've told her.

500
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:04,362
Yeah, I actually talked with
Sally Hoagland yesterday in person.

501
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:07,240
Thought you said you were out in Wyoming.

502
00:33:07,241 --> 00:33:08,951
I am. Why?

503
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:11,327
Well, amigo, Sally resides in Florida.

504
00:33:11,328 --> 00:33:14,456
You know, Sunshine State, Sunshine Sally.

505
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:16,959
You must've talked to someone else.

506
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,045
Is the Sunshine Sally you're
talking about really into turtles?

507
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:23,799
Yeah. She won't shut up about them.

508
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,593
Yeah, she lives out here
in Absaroka County now.

509
00:33:26,594 --> 00:33:27,844
Lucky you, then.

510
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:31,215
Sunshine Sally is a
stone-cold smokin' fox.

511
00:33:34,018 --> 00:33:35,594
She is.

512
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:39,556
[Ferg] Sheriff, you there?

513
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:42,066
What do you got?

514
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:47,113
I just found a picture of Sally
Hoagland taped to Thorvin Hampton's desk.

515
00:33:47,114 --> 00:33:48,281
I think we need to reconsider

516
00:33:48,282 --> 00:33:51,110
whether we want to believe a
single thing she's told us so far.

517
00:33:53,245 --> 00:33:54,738
[sighs]

518
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,338
[Walt] When did you
move to Absaroka county?

519
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:04,915
[Sally] About six weeks ago.

520
00:34:06,258 --> 00:34:09,469
We all lived in Coral
Springs, Florida, before that.

521
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,806
Your fellow CBers seem to
think you still live in Florida.

522
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:15,475
Well, you can't exactly
control what people think.

523
00:34:15,476 --> 00:34:17,511
- Can you?
- [Walt] No.

524
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:23,392
But you can try.

525
00:34:25,069 --> 00:34:27,904
Did Thorvin even know
that you'd moved here?

526
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:32,193
Or did he still think that
you were her living in Florida?

527
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:40,750
Did you move here to be closer to him?

528
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:43,579
Was he angry that you lied to him?

529
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:47,007
[scoffs]

530
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:48,918
He had no idea.

531
00:34:54,181 --> 00:34:58,267
I tried to approach him
a few weeks ago at a bar

532
00:34:58,268 --> 00:35:02,480
just to, you know, introduce
myself to him as the real me.

533
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:05,017
We'd bonded so much over the radio.

534
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:11,065
But when I walked up to him,
it was like I wasn't even there.

535
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:15,077
I was just some old heifer in his eyes.

536
00:35:15,078 --> 00:35:18,114
He wouldn't give me the
time of day, so I left.

537
00:35:18,664 --> 00:35:20,957
And later that night,

538
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:25,336
we were back on the radio,
talking into the night like always

539
00:35:25,337 --> 00:35:27,164
because he thought I looked like this.

540
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:33,420
I moved out here thinking
that he was my soul mate.

541
00:35:36,057 --> 00:35:38,474
Turns out he was just another guy.

542
00:35:38,475 --> 00:35:40,143
Did that make you angry?

543
00:35:40,144 --> 00:35:42,145
Of course it made me angry.

544
00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:44,140
But that doesn't mean I killed him.

545
00:35:44,857 --> 00:35:47,935
I've never even been up
to that damn War Eagle.

546
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:51,521
How'd you know that was
where we found Thorvin's body?

547
00:35:55,868 --> 00:35:56,902
[sighs]

548
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,876
[Vic] You mean you can't
get ahold of Walt, either?

549
00:36:04,877 --> 00:36:07,746
[Ruby] He's not picking
up. Maybe I should try Ferg.

550
00:36:11,592 --> 00:36:13,676
[sighs]

551
00:36:13,677 --> 00:36:17,131
You're not exactly
talking in code out here.

552
00:36:20,726 --> 00:36:23,553
[rock music playing]

553
00:36:26,732 --> 00:36:30,693
Hey, babe, let me get
four top-shelf tequilas.

554
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:33,947
None of that usual
watered-down cat piss, okay?

555
00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:35,615
Put it on my tab.

556
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:38,076
Under what name? Prince Charming?

557
00:36:38,077 --> 00:36:40,070
[chuckles] Lane Potter.

558
00:36:40,913 --> 00:36:44,373
And if you bring it to us with the
right kind of smile on your face,

559
00:36:44,374 --> 00:36:45,909
I'll make it worth your while.

560
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:10,066
[Vic] I ran both sets of
prints through the database.

561
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:12,902
First of all, the prints you
pulled from Branch's computer

562
00:37:12,903 --> 00:37:14,988
do not belong to Jacob Nighthorse.

563
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:16,405
They belong to Branch.

564
00:37:16,406 --> 00:37:20,485
Second of all, Jacob Nighthorse
is not actually Jacob Nighthorse.

565
00:37:21,996 --> 00:37:23,329
Then who is he?

566
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,747
Jacob Harold Blankenship.

567
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:26,499
And under that name in 1978,

568
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,128
he was arrested for assaulting
an FBI agent in Washington, D.C.

569
00:37:30,129 --> 00:37:33,589
I never got that on any of
the background checks I ran.

570
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,710
That's because under Jacob
Nighthorse, his record is clean.

571
00:37:38,846 --> 00:37:40,889
What about his record as Jacob Blankenship?

572
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,851
Well, it turns out that Jacob Blankenship
is a part-time political radical

573
00:37:44,852 --> 00:37:46,561
and a full-time pain in the ass.

574
00:37:46,562 --> 00:37:49,313
In the, um, early '80s,

575
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:53,776
he was pretty active in a group
called the American Indian Movement.

576
00:37:53,777 --> 00:37:55,778
[Walt] Yeah. A.I.M.

577
00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:59,866
It's sort of like the Black
Panthers for Indians, so...

578
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:04,704
Well, Nighthorse, or Blankenship,
whatever, he also had a partner in crime.

579
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:07,916
His name was Dennis
Wabash. He died in 1983.

580
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:10,744
Guess what Wabash's cause of death was.

581
00:38:11,921 --> 00:38:13,922
- Gunshot wound?
- To the head.

582
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:15,590
Self-inflicted.

583
00:38:15,591 --> 00:38:17,717
Presumably.

584
00:38:17,718 --> 00:38:20,212
So, what did you find
out about Sunshine Sally?

585
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:28,186
False identities, bad
histories, toxic grudge.

586
00:38:28,187 --> 00:38:29,679
Uh...

587
00:38:30,814 --> 00:38:34,984
Sally Hoagland was
misrepresenting herself to Thorvin.

588
00:38:34,985 --> 00:38:38,571
She also moved here without
telling him, maybe to stalk him.

589
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:40,489
She was tracking our
activities on a scanner,

590
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:44,786
so she knew Thorvin was dead
well before Ferg talked to her.

591
00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:46,996
You think she's gonna make a run for it?

592
00:38:46,997 --> 00:38:50,499
I got Ferg camped out at her
house, so if she tries, we'll know.

593
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,376
Why don't you check her background,

594
00:38:52,377 --> 00:38:54,587
see if she's got any sort
of record back in Florida?

595
00:38:54,588 --> 00:38:56,298
[Vic] What about Jacob?

596
00:38:56,299 --> 00:39:01,094
Uh, I'll find out what he was
involved in in his Blankenship days.

597
00:39:01,095 --> 00:39:04,722
Extremists tend to be made, not born.

598
00:39:04,723 --> 00:39:07,510
[rock music playing]

599
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:31,624
[door opens]

600
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:33,293
[door closes]

601
00:39:33,294 --> 00:39:34,828
[footsteps]

602
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:37,839
[knock on door]

603
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,341
Occupied.

604
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:40,633
[knock on door]

605
00:39:40,634 --> 00:39:44,421
Hey, shit bird, if you need
to go that bad, use the sink.

606
00:39:55,232 --> 00:39:57,233
Shit.

607
00:39:57,234 --> 00:39:59,853
Hey, man, what do you want?

608
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:05,108
Listen, I'm sure whoever sent you,
it was just a misunderstanding.

609
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:10,655
[door closes]

610
00:40:17,129 --> 00:40:18,663
Oh, shit.

611
00:40:26,347 --> 00:40:27,964
[door closes]

612
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:33,769
Find anything from
Florida on Sally Hoagland?

613
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,604
Not yet.

614
00:40:35,605 --> 00:40:36,647
What are you doing?

615
00:40:36,648 --> 00:40:39,567
Are you searching Branch's
computer for prints again?

616
00:40:39,568 --> 00:40:41,604
I'm searching.

617
00:40:46,783 --> 00:40:48,659
- [Rett] Come on, move it.
- [Walt] Mr. Jacky.

618
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,078
Can we help you?

619
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,030
- What?
- Here.

620
00:40:52,664 --> 00:40:54,332
- Dad.
- Get in there.

621
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:55,867
What?

622
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,545
[groans]

623
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:02,048
I would like to apologize, Sheriff.

624
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:05,427
I thought I had raised
my son to tell the truth.

625
00:41:05,428 --> 00:41:07,136
But I was wrong.

626
00:41:07,137 --> 00:41:10,181
He did steal money from that
camp's damn donation box.

627
00:41:10,182 --> 00:41:14,143
And don't ask me where he thought
this idea was acceptable behavior.

628
00:41:14,144 --> 00:41:18,273
If I recall, you're not exactly a
fan of Thorvin's plans for War Eagle.

629
00:41:18,274 --> 00:41:20,691
Oh, I do have issues with
them reopening that camp.

630
00:41:20,692 --> 00:41:24,313
But my son stole and
vandalized private property.

631
00:41:24,905 --> 00:41:27,615
Now we know he's a thief and a liar.

632
00:41:27,616 --> 00:41:29,658
I'm just praying to God
he's not a killer, too.

633
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:31,660
[grunts] Damn it, Dad, I told you not...

634
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:34,330
I didn't see anyone up there.
I didn't see anyone up there.

635
00:41:34,331 --> 00:41:35,873
[Rett] Maybe you did, maybe you didn't.

636
00:41:35,874 --> 00:41:38,209
But that's the problem
with being a liar, son.

637
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,962
People can't believe you either way.

638
00:41:40,963 --> 00:41:44,632
Sheriff, whatever my boy has done,

639
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:47,877
I want him to suffer the full
consequences for his actions.

640
00:41:49,554 --> 00:41:53,475
I just thank God his grandfather's
not alive to see this.

641
00:41:53,476 --> 00:41:56,553
Jumping around in his goddamn underwear.

642
00:41:59,315 --> 00:42:01,107
[Walt] How much did he take?

643
00:42:01,108 --> 00:42:03,810
Uh, $87.

644
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:07,981
And one historical artifact.

645
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:21,002
I got the impression that Francis Igawa
was looking for a lighter in his kitchen.

646
00:42:21,003 --> 00:42:23,171
So did I.

647
00:42:23,172 --> 00:42:24,339
Any idea what it says?

648
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,590
Japanese? No.

649
00:42:26,591 --> 00:42:28,510
I don't know any Japanese.

650
00:42:28,511 --> 00:42:30,052
Do you?

651
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:31,429
No.

652
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,932
But I did go out to sushi a few weeks ago.

653
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:39,354
Cool little mom-and-pop place that
operates out of an old gas station.

654
00:42:39,355 --> 00:42:42,731
The menu's entirely in Japanese.

655
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:44,317
What are you doing?

656
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,069
I had to download this app to
be able to read the sushi menu.

657
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,573
It translates images into
text. Technology, right?

658
00:42:50,574 --> 00:42:52,700
In the meantime, we
could use this opportunity

659
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:56,112
to talk about my feelings
regarding my past trauma.

660
00:43:01,502 --> 00:43:02,502
Uh...

661
00:43:02,503 --> 00:43:05,338
- [ding]
- Oh, look. It's done translating.

662
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:07,089
Good.

663
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,757
Saved by the bell.

664
00:43:08,758 --> 00:43:10,676
[clears throat]

665
00:43:10,677 --> 00:43:15,181
"If this is my corpse,
bring the little birds

666
00:43:15,182 --> 00:43:17,725
so it's admitted I said the name.

667
00:43:17,726 --> 00:43:22,313
Private J. Igawa."

668
00:43:22,314 --> 00:43:24,773
That is a huge coincidence

669
00:43:24,774 --> 00:43:28,277
that the Jacky kid just
happened to find this lighter

670
00:43:28,278 --> 00:43:32,073
after it's been sitting up at
War Eagle for the last 70 years.

671
00:43:32,074 --> 00:43:36,578
Or maybe Francis Igawa left
it there a couple days ago.

672
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:38,704
[Vic] We've seen him.

673
00:43:38,705 --> 00:43:42,708
No offense, but Mr. Igawa doesn't
even know what planet he's on.

674
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:46,670
Unless, of course, you think that he
understands more than he's letting on.

675
00:43:46,671 --> 00:43:49,458
He understood that his lighter was missing.

676
00:43:52,177 --> 00:43:53,712
[sighs]

677
00:43:55,972 --> 00:43:59,392
This is Sheriff Walt
Longmire from Absaroka County.

678
00:43:59,393 --> 00:44:04,313
Your father was upset about losing
something when we visited you.

679
00:44:04,314 --> 00:44:07,400
- Was it a lighter?
- [Shiori] I think that's what it was.

680
00:44:07,401 --> 00:44:09,026
Why?

681
00:44:09,027 --> 00:44:11,187
I think we found it.

682
00:44:11,696 --> 00:44:14,740
Does your father ever get out of the house?

683
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:16,033
[Shiori] Sometimes.

684
00:44:16,034 --> 00:44:18,244
I change the locks and
try to hide the keys,

685
00:44:18,245 --> 00:44:20,622
but he always seems to find a way out.

686
00:44:20,623 --> 00:44:21,581
Dad.

687
00:44:21,582 --> 00:44:23,999
Does he ever get out to your car?

688
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,462
[Shiori] I'm doing the best I can.

689
00:44:27,463 --> 00:44:32,007
I'm sure you are, but,
uh, there's a problem.

690
00:44:32,008 --> 00:44:34,469
Soon after your
half-uncle, Thorvin Hampton,

691
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:38,173
came to visit your father,
Mr. Hampton was murdered.

692
00:44:38,974 --> 00:44:42,268
Then we found your father's
lighter at the scene.

693
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:46,439
[Shiori] Sheriff, what are you saying?

694
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,566
I'd like to help your father

695
00:44:48,567 --> 00:44:53,070
live out his days in a
facility rather than a prison.

696
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:57,693
Now, if you bring him up to War Eagle,
I may be able to help him do that.

697
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:13,007
Kind of tucked this
place away, didn't they?

698
00:45:13,008 --> 00:45:15,043
Out of sight, out of mind.

699
00:45:19,264 --> 00:45:20,965
Is this your father's?

700
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,512
Grandfather's, actually.

701
00:45:26,938 --> 00:45:29,474
He took it with him when
he fought in World War II.

702
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:33,653
"You found my body, deliver this to Birdie

703
00:45:33,654 --> 00:45:36,648
so she knows I died while singing her name.

704
00:45:37,866 --> 00:45:39,908
Private J. Igawa."

705
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:43,071
My grandfather was James Franklin Igawa.

706
00:45:44,122 --> 00:45:47,667
He and my Grandma Birdie were
married for just about three weeks

707
00:45:47,668 --> 00:45:50,161
when they were forced to come here.

708
00:45:50,713 --> 00:45:52,380
Six months after that,

709
00:45:52,381 --> 00:45:56,884
Grandpa James was drafted by
the U.S. Army to fight overseas.

710
00:45:56,885 --> 00:45:59,261
[Walt] Did your father tell you that?

711
00:45:59,262 --> 00:46:01,556
No.

712
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:05,226
I put it together through family
friends and public records.

713
00:46:05,227 --> 00:46:08,896
I had to pull a couple of
double shifts at work this week.

714
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:11,190
Think he made his way out here?

715
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:15,103
Well, I think so.

716
00:46:15,862 --> 00:46:18,857
Let's see if we can, uh,
walk our way through this.

717
00:46:19,908 --> 00:46:23,077
If your father didn't mean to kill Thorvin,

718
00:46:23,078 --> 00:46:25,113
that would really help his case.

719
00:46:41,054 --> 00:46:43,806
Does your father have
a history of violence?

720
00:46:43,807 --> 00:46:49,178
He's always had anger issues,
even before his dementia.

721
00:46:51,273 --> 00:46:55,401
He believed his belt was the best way

722
00:46:55,402 --> 00:46:59,648
to teach me how to be a good,
obedient Japanese daughter.

723
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:02,408
That sounds hard.

724
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:04,993
Is this where it happened?

725
00:47:04,994 --> 00:47:07,121
No.

726
00:47:07,122 --> 00:47:10,492
Thorvin Hampton's body
was found right down here.

727
00:47:30,103 --> 00:47:32,722
You have any trouble finding this place?

728
00:47:33,774 --> 00:47:35,023
Not really.

729
00:47:35,024 --> 00:47:37,519
I just followed the signs.

730
00:47:39,822 --> 00:47:41,731
You mean these signs.

731
00:47:44,117 --> 00:47:46,744
I took them all down earlier today,

732
00:47:46,745 --> 00:47:50,706
but, uh, you remembered
how to get here anyway

733
00:47:50,707 --> 00:47:56,913
because you've been here before.
In this room. With your half-uncle.

734
00:48:01,677 --> 00:48:05,047
Are you gonna lock me in here
like you did Thorvin Hampton?

735
00:48:06,515 --> 00:48:11,560
You never thought it was my dad, did you?

736
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:13,562
I considered it.

737
00:48:13,563 --> 00:48:17,608
But what seemed much more likely
was that you drove out here,

738
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:21,362
brought your father because
he couldn't be alone.

739
00:48:21,363 --> 00:48:26,868
You lured me out here under false pretenses

740
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:29,905
just so you could lock me up.

741
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:34,117
I guess some things never change.

742
00:48:36,628 --> 00:48:38,045
Shiori.

743
00:48:38,046 --> 00:48:39,463
Did you lock Thorvin in here?

744
00:48:39,464 --> 00:48:41,541
What else should I have done?

745
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,635
Given him a donation?

746
00:48:44,636 --> 00:48:47,847
That man's father ruined my family.

747
00:48:47,848 --> 00:48:50,933
My grandmother killed herself out of shame,

748
00:48:50,934 --> 00:48:53,227
and now he wanted to
make a museum out of it

749
00:48:53,228 --> 00:48:55,521
so he could feel better about himself.

750
00:48:55,522 --> 00:48:58,816
Maybe I should've given him a
picture of Grandma Birdie's headstone

751
00:48:58,817 --> 00:49:02,444
so he could stick it on a
T-shirt and sell it as a souvenir.

752
00:49:02,445 --> 00:49:07,324
Well, Thorvin Hampton's father
may have destroyed your family,

753
00:49:07,325 --> 00:49:09,284
but Thorvin didn't do anything wrong.

754
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:11,036
[Shiori] Guess what.

755
00:49:11,037 --> 00:49:13,823
These people didn't do
anything wrong, either.

756
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:18,544
They were just trying to live their lives,

757
00:49:18,545 --> 00:49:23,674
just like I was trying to live my
life and take care of my father.

758
00:49:23,675 --> 00:49:26,802
And now Thorvin Hampton barges in,

759
00:49:26,803 --> 00:49:29,889
announces that he's my
dad's long-lost half-brother,

760
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:32,182
and leaves me to deal with the damage.

761
00:49:32,183 --> 00:49:34,552
Did you come here to get revenge for that?

762
00:49:37,647 --> 00:49:42,685
He invited us to visit,
for closure, he said.

763
00:49:43,695 --> 00:49:46,572
So, after a couple of days
of dealing with my father,

764
00:49:46,573 --> 00:49:48,900
I took him up on the offer.

765
00:49:49,576 --> 00:49:52,236
God knows I needed something.

766
00:49:53,246 --> 00:49:56,158
So, I-I drove us out here.

767
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:58,542
[sighs]

768
00:49:58,543 --> 00:50:01,121
Did your father know where you were going?

769
00:50:01,755 --> 00:50:03,589
[Shiori] Who knows?

770
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:07,585
Yelled the whole way and refused to
get out of the car once we got here.

771
00:50:08,804 --> 00:50:14,308
So, I talked to this Thorvin guy by myself.

772
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:17,553
And he was so...

773
00:50:19,105 --> 00:50:21,273
proud of himself,

774
00:50:21,274 --> 00:50:26,521
of his courage to put this
shit hole back together.

775
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:32,952
He had no idea what this
place had done to my family,

776
00:50:32,953 --> 00:50:34,737
to me.

777
00:50:35,497 --> 00:50:38,290
So, he leads me in here
and shows me all this stuff

778
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:42,120
and says, "I can only
imagine what it was like."

779
00:50:43,046 --> 00:50:49,044
And I thought, "You know, I can
show you exactly what it was like."

780
00:50:49,552 --> 00:50:51,720
So then you locked Thorvin in here.

781
00:50:51,721 --> 00:50:54,849
Just like the government did to us.

782
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,350
And you just left.

783
00:50:56,351 --> 00:50:58,644
Well, first I had to track down my father,

784
00:50:58,645 --> 00:51:02,064
who was off wandering into some field,
dropping his lighter, apparently,

785
00:51:02,065 --> 00:51:04,851
but then, yeah.

786
00:51:05,652 --> 00:51:10,031
Yeah, I-I left and
pretended it never happened.

787
00:51:10,032 --> 00:51:11,323
Why?

788
00:51:11,324 --> 00:51:14,035
Because I'm an American.

789
00:51:14,036 --> 00:51:16,029
I don't like to live in the past.

790
00:51:22,377 --> 00:51:24,412
[Walt] That's true of a lot of people.

791
00:51:27,049 --> 00:51:28,958
But not Thorvin.

792
00:51:35,181 --> 00:51:37,050
[handcuffs clicking]

793
00:51:52,198 --> 00:51:54,491
[chuckles]

794
00:51:54,492 --> 00:51:57,737
It's so beautiful here.

795
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,585
[man] You know, I never even
met the guy face-to-face.

796
00:52:04,586 --> 00:52:06,537
He was just a voice on the radio.

797
00:52:07,047 --> 00:52:09,673
He was as good an amigo as I ever had.

798
00:52:09,674 --> 00:52:13,385
[Sally] Maybe folks should get together
and have some drinks in his honor.

799
00:52:13,386 --> 00:52:15,429
[man 2] Who y'all talking
about? Someone die?

800
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,222
[man 1] Toe Tapper.

801
00:52:17,223 --> 00:52:18,807
[Sally] Thorvin Hampton.

802
00:52:18,808 --> 00:52:20,601
[man 2] Oh, man, not Thorvin.

803
00:52:20,602 --> 00:52:22,678
They don't make them like that anymore.

804
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:38,911
Jess. Where's Henry?

805
00:52:38,912 --> 00:52:40,780
Men's room cleaning up.

806
00:52:46,502 --> 00:52:49,880
Hooligans have been writing graffiti
on the mirror in permanent marker.

807
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:54,176
I got Ruby's note, said you'd heard
back from your contact at the university.

808
00:52:54,177 --> 00:52:55,636
I did.

809
00:52:55,637 --> 00:52:58,847
My friend identified the pollen
in Branch's shotgun shell.

810
00:52:58,848 --> 00:53:03,102
It comes from arrowleaf
balsamroot, a common wildflower.

811
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,227
Yeah.

812
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:06,147
Grows out by my cabin.

813
00:53:06,148 --> 00:53:08,183
Just about everywhere else.

814
00:53:09,985 --> 00:53:11,560
[sighs]

815
00:53:14,948 --> 00:53:20,410
Although, Martha tried to
put some in pots one time.

816
00:53:20,411 --> 00:53:23,705
She overwatered the
seedlings, and they died.

817
00:53:23,706 --> 00:53:26,167
My friend did mention
that arrowleaf balsamroot

818
00:53:26,168 --> 00:53:29,377
is notoriously intolerant of watery soils.

819
00:53:29,378 --> 00:53:33,007
Which means Branch was not shot
anywhere near the creek bed.

820
00:53:33,008 --> 00:53:34,633
The entire scene was staged.

821
00:53:34,634 --> 00:53:37,552
The evidence suggests that that is correct.

822
00:53:37,553 --> 00:53:41,424
So our next step is to
find the actual crime scene.

823
00:53:42,225 --> 00:53:47,471
Now, if you want to step away
from this, I'll understand.

824
00:53:48,272 --> 00:53:51,108
I have never been one to
back down from a fight.

825
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:52,734
[Walt] Good.

826
00:53:52,735 --> 00:53:54,354
Me either.
