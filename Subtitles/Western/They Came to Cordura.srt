1
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,837
How far is Col. Rogers
from this ranch?

2
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,951
About 30 miles southwest.

3
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,913
Does somebody claim Pancho Villa
might actually be there?

4
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,230
All we know is two
or three hundred Mexicans...

5
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,799
...under two of Villa's generals...

6
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,837
...attacked the town
of Carrizal yesterday.

7
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,958
Defeated the Mexican regulars
and then moved on to this ranch.

8
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,951
- How do you pronounce it?
- Ojos Azules.

9
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,917
It's owned by an American woman.

10
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,629
If all she's got is a bullet through
the brain, she's luckier than most.

11
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,313
- Can't get through yet?
- No, sir!

12
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,833
Keep trying.

13
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,316
- Not much of a story.
- Not much of a war.

14
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,836
Wind, sand, silence.

15
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,076
We're chasing one man,
Pancho Villa...

16
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,754
...over some of the wildest country
on earth.

17
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,592
You can me quote as saying that:

18
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,637
The punitive expedition U.S. Army...

19
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,112
...has him completely surrounded.
On one side.

20
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,435
Gentlemen, this is Major Thorn.
Mr. Kinglake, <i>New York World</i>...

21
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,079
...Mr. Dyson, <i>The Sun</i>.
- Major.

22
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,279
The major has been designated
as awards officer by General Pershing.

23
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,159
Weren't you the executive officer
of the 28th Calvary...

24
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,515
...under Colonel Rogers?
- That's right, sir.

25
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,150
Then you were with Rogers when Villa
crossed the New Mexico border...

26
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,709
...and attacked the town of Columbus.

27
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,348
- Got a field officer, I don't understand...
- Major.

28
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,670
Your recommendation
for the Medal of Honor...

29
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,149
...for this sergeant...
- Boyce, sir. Sgt. Boyce.

30
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,833
Been approved
by the War Department.

31
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,797
It came over the wire
several hours ago.

32
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,952
- You can tell him he's officially a hero.
- Boyce is dead.

33
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,475
He was killed yesterday
in the fight at Guerrero.

34
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,790
That's hard news. I'm sorry.

35
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,191
I have another one with me.
A boy named Hetherington.

36
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,273
What he did was worth the medal.
I intend to recommend him for it.

37
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,870
- Does he know?
- Not yet.

38
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,949
Colonel, I would like to keep him
out of action and alive.

39
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,516
Until the medal is approved.
That's the least we can do.

40
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,116
Permission to send him back to base
at Cordura until we know?

41
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,558
- Granted.
- Made contact with Col. Rogers, sir.

42
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,752
His scouts confirm our reports.

43
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,708
Wants permission to force march
immediately and attack on sight.

44
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,315
Old Rogers wants a fight.
Wants it badly.

45
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,754
Tell him to go ahead.

46
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,751
I can start early
and join up with him...

47
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,070
...at the base of the mountain
at Cusihuiriachic.

48
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,276
All right, Tom.

49
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,029
Does this order apply to anyone I may
want to recommend for the citation?

50
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,556
- Yes, it does.
- Thank you, sir.

51
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,389
- Colonel?
- Yes?

52
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,999
Don't you think it's a little unusual,
placing all this stress on awards?

53
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,675
I mean, appointing an officer
of field grade as awards officer...

54
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,070
...and allowing him to take men
out of action.

55
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,357
- Or is this Army custom?
- There are good reasons.

56
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,629
- Would you care to mention them?
- All right. Let me read you something.

57
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,599
"Paris, April 17, 1916.

58
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,356
The German bombardment of Verdun
continued for the 43rd day.

59
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,149
Despite terrible punishment,
the French army still holds firm."

60
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,437
Gentlemen, our country is gonna need
an army soon. A big one.

61
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,397
With spirit to go with it.

62
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,189
In the meantime, it will have some
live heroes to think about.

63
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,877
Colonel, I'd like to do a story
on Major Thorn.

64
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,190
- The answer is no.
- Why not?

65
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,591
He's a sort of Homer on horseback.
Galloping around the country...

66
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,557
...looking for bravery in battles.

67
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,076
- Make a wonderful story.
- I said, no.

68
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,915
You want to go to General Pershing,
you'll get the same answer.

69
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,830
Wind, sand and silence.

70
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,278
And censorship.

71
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,313
Now, from the top of the mountain
to the hacienda. How far?

72
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,152
Maybe a mile, <i>mas o menos</i>.

73
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,880
Ask how many of Villa's men
passed through yesterday.

74
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,352
One says 100, maybe 200.
The other says maybe 400.

75
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,319
They are quartered here
in the ranch at Ojos Azules.

76
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,914
Now, this Geary woman
who owns the ranch...

77
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,150
What can she do?

78
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,393
- These bandits take what they want or...
- She's giving aid to the enemy.

79
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,599
- She takes no sides, Seòor Colonel...
- No sides? Why, she's an American.

80
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,874
Gentlemen, you've heard
what's going on in France.

81
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,838
Well, you've seen signs of it here.
Planes, trucks.

82
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,468
The day of the soldier on horse
is over, they say.

83
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,871
This may be the last
cavalry campaign ever fought.

84
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,477
Well, if it is, we're gonna show them
something they'll never forget.

85
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,438
At daybreak, I'm going to line
this entire regiment up...

86
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,874
...in single line abreast.

87
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,635
And we're going to have a last,
classic cavalry charge.

88
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,997
- I wish we had our sabres, sir.
- Son, I wish we had them too.

89
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,879
Sir, did you say regiment in line,
single line abreast?

90
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,792
You bet I said it.

91
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,794
I beg your pardon. We've never seen
regiment in line. Even on parade.

92
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,636
Then this is your lucky day
because you're gonna see it now.

93
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,269
Now, gentlemen, let's all pray God
in his goodness will give us this battle.

94
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,192
We'll leave here at 3:00.

95
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,999
That should bring us to the top
of the mountain by dawn.

96
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,357
That's all, gentlemen. Get some sleep.

97
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,875
Yes, Tom?

98
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,112
These are my orders
from Col. DeRose.

99
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,595
- Is he one of your heroes?
- Yes, sir.

100
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,875
You understand, Tom, that you too
are to take no part in this action.

101
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,315
I understand, sir.

102
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,713
Can't you sleep, son?

103
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,750
Sure is cold. Gets in your bones
nights and stays there all day.

104
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,918
I would like to read you something.

105
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,349
"Andrew L. Hetherington, Private.

106
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,273
L Troop, 6th Calvary,
for conspicuous gallantry...

107
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,398
...at risk of life above and beyond
the call of duty.

108
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,473
On 14 of April, 1916, at Guerrero."

109
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,829
I'm recommending you
for the Congressional Medal of Honor.

110
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,555
This is the highest honour
our country can give a soldier.

111
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,312
I'm sending it to Washington.
Meanwhile, you'll be sent to Cordura.

112
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,274
Stay there until we get the telegraph
from the War Department approving it.

113
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,358
That is why you won't fight tomorrow.

114
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,036
Hetherington, I'd like to ask
you a personal question.

115
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,192
I'd appreciate your answering.

116
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,516
What you did at Guerrero
was a very brave thing.

117
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,511
What made you do it?

118
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,431
Try to remember.
It's very important to me.

119
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,155
Try to remember how it was.
What you felt. What you thought.

120
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,113
- Major.
- Yes?

121
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,714
I'm sorry I got to crying.
I couldn't help it.

122
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,316
I did remember how it was,
but I didn't wanna say.

123
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,956
The honest truth is that at Guerrero,
the Lord took hold of me.

124
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,317
- The Lord?
- You see, major, I'd lost the faith.

125
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,714
Faith in what?

126
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,916
My father's church,
Christ Resurrected.

127
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,877
- Was he a preacher?
- Evangelist.

128
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,676
We were always travelling.
At meetings...

129
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,799
...he'd play trombone, my mother
the organ. I recited the Bible.

130
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,839
Would you believe by the time I was 8,
I knew the whole Bible by heart.

131
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,831
Try me. Any verse, any chapter.

132
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,594
- I believe you, son.
- I should know it.

133
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,876
He beat it into me.

134
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,679
I lost the faith and ran away.

135
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,316
But at Guerrero, sir, I found it again.

136
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,677
The Lord took hold of me again.
I swear he did.

137
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,313
I'm sure glad I won't
have to fight tomorrow.

138
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,351
Line the troops in column of fours!

139
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,115
Line the troops in column of fours!

140
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,836
Line the troops in column of fours!

141
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,992
Line the troops in column of fours!

142
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,958
Line the troops in column of fours!

143
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,634
Line the troops in column of fours!

144
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,952
Line the troops in column of fours!

145
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,473
Guidons out!

146
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,118
Line of troops in column of twos!

147
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,878
Line of troopers boot to boot!

148
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,509
Companies, halt!

149
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,150
Left troops, envelop the ranch!

150
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,790
Don't fire your pistols
until the charge strikes.

151
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,835
Officers post!

152
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,353
Seòor Arreaga?

153
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,431
Arreaga!

154
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,430
- Draw pistols!
- Draw pistols!

155
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,475
- Trot, ho!
- Trot, ho!

156
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,670
- Charge!
- Charge!

157
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,309
This way! Take cover, this way!

158
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,598
What are we gonna do now,
lieutenant?

159
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,789
- We can't just sit here, sir.
- Cover me!

160
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,239
Okay, boys, I'm shooting one,
two, three, four bandoleers.

161
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,516
And a rifle.

162
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,274
- Here, the last two bandoleers.
- Shoot. You're faded.

163
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,991
Come on, dice now.
You be true to Trubee, dice!

164
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,513
Hey, natural!

165
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,635
Come on, dice.
Right back, little Phoebe. Right back!

166
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,598
Tom.

167
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,958
I've been praying, Tom, and thanking
God for giving me a victory.

168
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,476
A charge. Think of it, Tom.

169
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,074
Maybe the last one for the old cavalry.

170
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,997
How I wish your father
were alive to see it.

171
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,914
Why, this'll make a whole issue
of the <i>Cavalry Journal</i>, Tom.

172
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,436
They'll cheer it on the floor
of Congress.

173
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,958
Do you realize that I may have my
general's star before the week's out?

174
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,910
Thirty-nine years I've waited for today.
I'm 63, you know.

175
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,640
They'll put me out
to grass in August...

176
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,954
...but God in his goodness has allowed
me to gather the fruits of my years.

177
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,156
Tom...

178
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,433
...I hope you'll take what I have
to say in the proper spirit.

179
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,229
But Congress is apt to be
in a very generous mood...

180
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,279
...and if they just happen to have
a citation of mine to act on...

181
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,719
...well, a victory, a retiring commander,
my star would be pretty well assured.

182
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,271
- I don't follow you, sir.
- I led the charge myself, Tom.

183
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,151
But you were commanding.
Leading the charge is line of duty.

184
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,753
At my age?

185
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,718
At my age, most men have
their second in command do it.

186
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,192
But not me.
I led the charge myself, Tom.

187
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,429
But there's nothing about age
or rank in the citation, sir.

188
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,116
- You won't do it?
- I can't, sir.

189
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,879
Sir, I'm recommending
four men from this regiment.

190
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,554
They are: Lt. William Fowler,
Sgt. John Chawk...

191
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,029
...Cpl. Milo Trubee and
Pvt. Wilbur Renziehausen.

192
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,111
Four citations.

193
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,192
And you won't even consider
the possibility of mine?

194
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,269
- I didn't think you'd ask me, sir.
- Why not?

195
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,234
I've done as humanly much for you
as one man can do for another.

196
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,598
More than an officer should. Only you
and DeRose and I know how much.

197
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,477
Heaven help you, Tom, if anyone
else ever puts two and two together.

198
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,632
You have the authorization
from Colonel DeRose.

199
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,917
I request that an officer
be detailed to take those men...

200
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,311
...to the rail headed to Cordura.
- Take them yourself!

201
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,630
I can't operate
as awards officer that way.

202
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,870
There may be a fight at Peloncillos.

203
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,316
Take them! They're yours, aren't they?

204
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,953
And you can take
this Geary woman too!

205
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,829
She's under guard. Take her back,
under arrest on my charges:

206
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,600
Aid and comfort to the enemy.
Treason.

207
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,072
Any other damn thing in the book, but
you take her with you! That's an order!

208
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,557
- Yes, sir.
- You're not dismissed, major!

209
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,317
You are an awards officer
because I recommended you for it.

210
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,835
I could have recommended
a court-martial for you.

211
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,834
For cowardice in the face
of the enemy.

212
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,235
I could give you an alternative.

213
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,997
Only one, and you'd crawl
to Washington with my citation.

214
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,433
If I had it to do again, Tom...

215
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,716
...I never would.

216
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,552
You have to live with yourself, yes.

217
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,669
But I have to live with
what I did for you.

218
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,993
Well, it's justice, I suppose.

219
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,028
What I saved you, I cost myself.

220
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,556
But don't misunderstand me.
I didn't do it for your sake...

221
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,999
...but for your father's.

222
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,634
- Are you in charge?
- Yes, I'm Major Thorn.

223
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,873
I have orders to take you to Cordura.
It's about a two-day ride.

224
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,112
It will make it a lot easier
on everybody and yourself...

225
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,352
...if you give me your word
of honour not to try to escape.

226
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,749
Well, what's your decision?

227
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,955
You're the jailer. You decide.

228
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,189
This woman is to be watched
at all times.

229
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,238
Conversation will be kept
to a minimum.

230
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,319
- Take over.
- All right, quickly now!

231
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,029
- Guard detail, mount.
- This is not a guard detail, lieutenant.

232
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,878
<i>The snak es in the mountains</i>
<i>The eels in the sea</i>

233
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,355
<i>Was a redheaded woman</i>

234
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,070
<i>Made a wreck out of me</i>

235
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,233
<i>And it looks like</i>
<i>I'm never gonna cease</i>

236
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,230
<i>My wanderin'</i>

237
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,915
<i>If the whiskey don't get you</i>
<i>Then a woman must</i>

238
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,832
<i>I'd climb me a mountain</i>
<i>Sail me a sea</i>

239
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,750
<i>Till a redheaded wom...</i>

240
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,518
What are the charges against me?

241
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,999
He threw the book at you.

242
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,718
Specifically.

243
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,509
Loss of Nationality Act:
Any American knowingly aiding...

244
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,912
...the armed forces of a foreign country
can be deprived of their citizenship.

245
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,036
Major, why don't you let me go?

246
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,998
Admit that my arrest was ordered
by an excited old man...

247
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,071
...who will have forgotten me
in a week.

248
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,596
Who may not have the authority
to arrest a citizen in the first place.

249
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,398
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

250
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,630
The charges against me
would never hold up.

251
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,870
"Aid and comfort to the enemy."

252
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,918
But you did quarter them
knowing the American Cavalry...

253
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,798
...was operating in this area.

254
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,679
For the last five years,
if you lived in this country...

255
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,717
...you quartered anybody
who came along.

256
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,192
Or they quartered themselves.
I've let them all in...

257
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,591
...and rationed them, and thanked God
when they were gone.

258
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,797
And another point,
if there is a Loss of Nationality Act...

259
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,632
...it must apply only in wartime.

260
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,268
- We're not in war with Mexico, are we?
- No.

261
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,635
So Pancho Villa's men
are not the armed forces...

262
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,712
...of another country, are they?
- Not exactly.

263
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,111
Then don't you have to admit,
anyone would have a difficult time...

264
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,840
...taking my citizenship
on grounds like these?

265
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,991
I guess they would.

266
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,075
Then why don't you let me go
and be rid of me?

267
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,874
Halt.

268
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,798
I give you my word,
I won't go back to my ranch...

269
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,793
...until your Colonel Rogers
has cleared out.

270
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,153
Lady, you're definitely much
too logical for a woman.

271
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,275
And now I suggest
we get back into formation.

272
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,038
Also, Ms. Geary,
you'll stay away from the men.

273
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,116
Not much in the line of rations, major.

274
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,633
Your cinch is too tight.

275
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,916
Hardtack and no smokes.

276
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,152
We won't be here long
enough for a fire, sergeant.

277
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,159
Chawk and Trubee are really worked
up about her smoking in front of them.

278
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,315
There's nothing I can
do about it, lieutenant.

279
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,473
I wish they had their tobacco rations.
They've been through a lot.

280
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,273
Excuse me, sir.

281
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,429
I haven't had a chance
to ask you yet...

282
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,431
...what you thought of the fight.

283
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,792
I mean, what was your professional
opinion? As an observer.

284
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,429
Well, I expect we'll get a big
write-up in the <i>Cavalry Journal</i>.

285
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,112
But as a military operation, conceived
and carried out, it was a farce.

286
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,436
- A farce?
- Exactly.

287
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,879
We all charged in there like
a whole gang of Don Quixotes.

288
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,917
- But we routed them.
- Of course.

289
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,030
But isn't it cavalry tradition to take
chances, to gamble against the odds?

290
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,714
That may be.

291
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,669
No officer ever takes
a command in the battle...

292
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,355
...with only hearsay knowledge
of the terrain and enemy positions.

293
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,671
Not even one still wet behind the ears.

294
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,468
Nevertheless, all the objectives
were taken.

295
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,838
Yes, because the Mexicans
didn't have rapid-fire weapons.

296
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,711
And because a few men, like you,
took the initiative at the right time.

297
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,313
Like myself?

298
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,636
Sir, you still haven't told me
exactly what kind of detail this is.

299
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,876
I will, in time.

300
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,871
Have the men prepare to march.

301
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,115
All right, prepare to march.

302
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,757
Stow it with your stuff.

303
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,838
Major, you know how long
we ain't had no smokes?

304
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,069
I know.

305
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,396
Well, you tell her that we don't like it.

306
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,790
You tell her that she taunts us
much more...

307
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,595
...someone will light them cigarettes
and stuff them down her throat.

308
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,069
Sergeant, you carry a tune very well.

309
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,549
Do you know any Mexican songs?

310
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,797
Mount up.

311
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,157
Major.

312
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,030
What will happen to me
after we get to Cordura?

313
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,118
I turn you over to the provost marshal.
After that...

314
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,829
I haven't crossed the border in eight
years, not since my father died.

315
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,433
I'll be frank with you.

316
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,356
I had a lot of bad publicity before
I came down here and my family did.

317
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,192
Most of it deserved.

318
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,035
Even though the case against
me falls of its own weight...

319
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,357
...the newspapers will hang me.

320
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,073
I don't know what a major's pay
amounts to, but I doubt if it's enough.

321
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,910
Would you be interested in $1000?

322
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,236
That wasn't a good idea.

323
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,950
I promised myself I wouldn't beg...

324
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,711
...but I am.

325
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,994
I'll stay with you as long
as you want me to.

326
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,512
As long as I know you'll let me go...

327
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,955
...before we get back to the States.

328
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,709
- No.
- Why not?

329
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,156
Because I wouldn't like
the company I'd be in.

330
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,635
You stupid, military...

331
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,198
Lieutenant!

332
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,591
Who gave you orders to fire?

333
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,391
She's trying to escape.
She's a military prisoner, major.

334
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,471
Or ain't she?

335
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,870
<i>My sister, she works in a laundry</i>

336
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,955
<i>My father keeps guzzling the gin</i>

337
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,754
<i>My mother, she tak es in the washing</i>

338
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,835
<i>Oh, Lord, how the money rolls in</i>

339
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,550
They've been asking me
questions, sir.

340
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,877
- Like what?
- Like what I was doing here.

341
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,599
- What did you tell them?
- I didn't tell them anything.

342
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,159
They took it mighty odd, though.

343
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,198
Looking at me like the meeting
people did when I used to recite...

344
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,432
...like they couldn't be comfortable
with me around.

345
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,430
Send Renziehausen over.

346
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,271
The major wants to see you.

347
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,757
Your full name is
Wilbur James Renziehausen?

348
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,433
Yes, sir.

349
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,354
- Where are you from?
- A farm near Alice, Wisconsin.

350
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,070
Why did you join the Army?

351
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,993
Looking for adventure.

352
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,674
Came out West to be a cowboy,
prospect for gold...

353
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,956
...fight Indians, anything.

354
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,639
The only trouble was
I couldn't ride or rope...

355
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,518
...the gold was all gone...

356
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,036
...now every Indian I met
was selling blankets or beads...

357
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,069
...but I did see the cavalry drill
at Fort Sam, so I joined right up.

358
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,032
Before you vaulted over the gate,
wasn't there another man...

359
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,829
...from Company C killed
trying the same thing?

360
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,708
Yes, sir, that was Corporal Brown.

361
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,391
You saw that happen,
but you went over anyway.

362
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,111
What made you do it?

363
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,950
- Try to remember.
- Well, major, I can't.

364
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,229
We had to get through the gate,
and somebody had to open it.

365
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,238
I was the nearest.

366
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,958
- And you weren't afraid?
- No, sir.

367
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,876
No, sir. I wasn't afraid. Not me.

368
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,754
I wasn't afraid during the whole fight.
Honest, major.

369
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,353
Are you sure?

370
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,510
Then how do you explain this?

371
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,435
Your chin strap
is bitten clean through.

372
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,759
You must have been very
hungry or very scared.

373
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,512
There's no harm to admit it.

374
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,875
Everyone's that way in battle.

375
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,950
Still, you went over the gate.

376
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,272
Can't you tell me why?
Try to remember.

377
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,956
That'll be all, Renziehausen.

378
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,758
Yes, sir.

379
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,113
Yes, lieutenant?

380
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,389
Sir, as an officer...

381
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,358
...I have a right to know
the purpose of this detail.

382
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,397
I think you have too.

383
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,950
You're a very brave man, lieutenant.

384
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,676
You know my assignment
on this campaign?

385
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,875
I've heard about it.

386
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,917
I'm recommending you
for the Medal of Honor.

387
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,479
The Medal of Honor?

388
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,116
I think you should know that
I'm recommending all the others.

389
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,236
That's the purpose of this detail...

390
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,597
...to return to base until Congress
approves the medal for all of you.

391
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,829
All of us?

392
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,592
You mean four men in one fight?

393
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,909
Why, that's impossible.

394
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,275
Well, that's for me to decide.

395
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,518
The Medal of Honor.

396
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,671
It must seem strange...

397
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,115
...to have the highest honour so early.

398
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,913
Whatever you do in combat for the
rest of your life will be an anticlimax.

399
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,313
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, it will.

400
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,557
Lieutenant...

401
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,878
...only you and Hetherington
know about this.

402
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,952
I want you to keep it quiet.

403
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,120
I didn't tell you before, lieutenant...

404
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,748
...because I want true answers
from all of you.

405
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,277
If you tell a man he's a hero,
then he thinks of himself as one...

406
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,512
...and then you've lost it.
You've lost the true reason.

407
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,509
Do you understand, lieutenant?

408
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,438
I have a chance here...

409
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,759
...a chance that few men
have ever had...

410
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,348
...to put my hand
on the bare heart of heroism...

411
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,829
...to hear answers
to one of the great questions...

412
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,514
...man has ever asked about himself.

413
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,429
What is courage?

414
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,993
- What is it that...?
- Give me that bottle back.

415
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,037
Give it back!

416
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,677
Give it!

417
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,350
Hand back that bottle, sergeant.

418
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,198
What's wrong with me and the boys
having a little of this? Spoils of war.

419
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,634
If she tries to escape...

420
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,189
...you have my permission
to do anything to stop her.

421
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,433
Beyond that, what she has or does
is none of our business.

422
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,199
So hand it over.

423
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,830
Whose side are you on, major?

424
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,435
Me and the boys ain't had
a drink or a smoke...

425
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,478
...since we crossed the border
five weeks ago.

426
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,591
Just whose side are you on anyway?

427
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,313
I'm commanding this detail...

428
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,517
...and I intend to take her to base
according to my orders.

429
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,234
If all of you knew why you
were detached from regiment...

430
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,517
...and what's gonna happen,
you'd stop acting like squaws...

431
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,477
...and soldier the rest of the way.

432
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,958
Now, hand back that bottle, sergeant.

433
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,157
This may be the most unusual detail...

434
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,392
...the Army has ever assembled
for any purpose.

435
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,434
I've already told Lt. Fowler
and Pvt. Hetherington...

436
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,194
...l'm recommending all of you
for the Medal of Honor.

437
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,312
Now you all know.

438
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,638
Between here and Cordura
I will talk to each one of you...

439
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,394
...and after that I'll write the citations.

440
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,676
It is not only my duty to write
the citations for you...

441
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,197
...I consider it a high privilege.

442
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,514
This medal means,
among other things...

443
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,434
...that for a few minutes Hetherington
at Guerrero and the rest of you...

444
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,115
...at the ranch at Ojos Azules
did more than duty required.

445
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,673
For a few minutes
you acted and lived...

446
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,196
...yes, you lived beyond
what is normally understood...

447
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,830
...to be the limit of human conduct.

448
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,154
That'll be all.

449
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,756
Lieutenant, have the men clean
their weapons before they turn in.

450
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,433
Palomito?

451
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,635
Palomito.

452
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,073
Excuse me, Major Thorn.
Not very ladylike, I know.

453
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,919
Not ladylike.

454
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,630
And a senator's daughter
should be ladylike.

455
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,312
Ever hear of my father?

456
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,275
A United States senator.

457
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,192
Very important man.

458
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,751
Very rich man.

459
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,077
Convicted of selling Indian lands...

460
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,630
...in 1908.

461
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,119
Big scandal.

462
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,918
Big man. Big scandal.

463
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,834
You're not making notes
in your book, major.

464
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,876
No citation for me?

465
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,271
I've lived beyond the limits
of human conduct.

466
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,632
Haven't I, Palomito?

467
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,150
Been married three times.

468
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,359
My last husband shot a man
who was in love with me.

469
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,790
Happened in a hotel room
in Norfolk, Virginia.

470
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,111
Big scandal. Big man's daughter.

471
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,038
Big scandal.

472
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,829
They gave him custody
of my two children.

473
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,350
Now the bird is my child.

474
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,993
- And the bottle.
- And the bottle.

475
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,670
Palomito.

476
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,755
Mustn't wake his children.

477
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,518
Heroes.

478
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,638
Heroes.

479
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,028
Mustn't wake his children.

480
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,477
His sleeping...

481
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,517
...snoring...

482
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,352
...dirty...

483
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,949
...lecherous children.

484
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,199
All right, who did this?

485
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,118
Of all the stupid,
senseless acts of pure savagery.

486
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,157
Speak up, who did it?

487
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,759
Speak up!

488
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,317
Lieutenant, have the men
get ready to pull out.

489
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,712
- They haven't had their breakfast, sir.
- They'll go without it.

490
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,633
There'll be no breaks today.
Push them hard.

491
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,435
Detail, halt.

492
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,552
I got so much pain, major.
Sir, I can't ride.

493
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,039
I got a boil.

494
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,556
I don't want to complain, but...

495
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,877
All right, get off your horse.

496
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,118
- I'll take a look.
- Detail, dismount.

497
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,995
Bring those horses up and form
a screen between us and the woman.

498
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,519
Drop your breeches.

499
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,195
Hetherington, watch the woman.

500
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,555
He sure looks the same all over,
don't he, major.

501
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,272
Sergeant, get some wood
and start a small fire.

502
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,075
You know, I haven't seen anything
like that since we left Columbus.

503
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,235
I'd like to have your tequila bottle.
I need to draw a boil.

504
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,837
Who killed my bird, major?
Chawk or Trubee?

505
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,196
I don't know.

506
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,512
I wouldn't give them my sweat
if they were dying of thirst.

507
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,510
- The boil is badly infected.
- The answer is no.

508
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,032
If you don't give me the bottle,
I'll have to take it.

509
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,832
You gonna draw it, major?

510
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,758
Lt'll be very painful.

511
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,593
It'll hurt like sin.

512
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,512
Turn him over on his stomach
and keep his breeches down.

513
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,715
I'd like a word with you, sir.

514
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,669
I've been deliberating
since last night...

515
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,991
...on the total effect of the Medal
of Honor upon my career.

516
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,993
And I'm very grateful to you,
sir, but I've decided...

517
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,310
...to stand on my privileges
as an officer...

518
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,153
...by requesting my case be removed
from consideration.

519
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,839
Why?

520
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,470
Well, there's an old service
maxim, sir...

521
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,756
...that I'm sure you're well aware of.

522
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,593
Career officers should make
themselves as inconspicuous...

523
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,149
...as possible,
particularly junior officers.

524
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,834
- I wasn't aware of it.
- Well, it's true, sir.

525
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,549
Too outstanding an exploit too early
in one's career would make one...

526
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,269
...a marked man, a sure victim
of the jealousy of one's superiors.

527
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,353
Request refused.

528
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,633
May I know why, sir?

529
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,389
I don't know of any precedent that
allows a man to refuse a decoration.

530
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,677
I grant that, major,
but between officers...

531
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:36,436
...and gentlemen, could there not be
an arrangement by which the citation...

532
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,636
...my citation,
would never reach channels?

533
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,074
Absolutely not.

534
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,913
- But, sir...
- Request refused.

535
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,428
Now lie still, hero.
This ain't gonna hurt a bit.

536
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,717
Bandage him up, lieutenant.

537
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,116
I brought your tequila back.

538
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,511
That didn't hurt a bit.

539
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,313
I'm hit!

540
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,112
My ear, my ear.
They shot off my ear!

541
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,630
You led us in here, major.
Do you think you can lead us out?

542
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,673
- When are we pulling out, sir?
- I don't know.

543
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:46,071
Well, in my opinion, the best time
would be around midnight.

544
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,800
We could walk our horses
to the mouth of the canyon...

545
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,269
...mount on signal,
pour it on and ride through.

546
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,351
In the best tradition of the cavalry.

547
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,592
We have darkness and the element
of surprise in our favour.

548
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,513
- I don't see any other choice.
- Well, I do.

549
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,399
- Yes?
- Waiting.

550
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,471
Waiting to see
what they propose to do.

551
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,790
We can't wait.
We'll soon run out of food.

552
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,518
We'll eat horse.

553
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,594
We're down to one-half
canteens of water.

554
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,958
It might rain.

555
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,113
And if they attack?

556
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,635
I think we can fight them off.

557
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,438
They won't attack.

558
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,436
All he has to do is wait
until you run out of food and water.

559
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,153
And then?

560
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,431
What'll they do to you?

561
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,195
Nothing.
He was my guest, remember?

562
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,956
Why did I have to be the one?

563
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,676
At the ranch they were shooting at me,
I didn't even get a scratch.

564
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,749
Major, I gotta have a look at myself.

565
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,834
Lady. Lady, have you got a mirror?

566
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,277
I look pretty awful, don't I?

567
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,078
Now, that's all right, boy.

568
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,993
Sergeant of mine in the Philippines
once lost an ear.

569
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,118
When he got back to the States,
they made him a rubber one...

570
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,431
...and it looked so lifelike
you couldn't tell the difference.

571
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,670
Besides, people never notice.

572
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,114
Yes, they will.

573
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,558
Lady. Lady, would you look at a fella
who had his ear shot off?

574
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,472
Of course I would.

575
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,240
All they'll notice is what's
around your neck.

576
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,437
- Did you ever see the Medal of Honor?
- No, sir.

577
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,478
It's the most beautiful decoration of all,
as it should be.

578
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,632
I'd trade an ear for one any time.
Two, in fact.

579
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,478
Excuse me, sir,
but I'd rather have the ear.

580
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,032
Relieve Hetherington.

581
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,110
- When are we pulling out, major?
- I've meant to ask you, sergeant...

582
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,111
...you been feeling up
to snuff lately?

583
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,191
How come we ain't pulling out
of here?

584
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,476
I have a few questions for you,
sergeant.

585
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,154
Just one I'm asking you, major.

586
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,752
When you started
for the roof of the ranch...

587
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,549
...on your own hook,
were you thinking of the troop?

588
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,917
Did you see they were in trouble
and feel you had to do something?

589
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,710
I figured I'd make that roof
and kill me a couple.

590
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,750
And you'll get the Medal of Honor
for that.

591
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,755
Have you thought about the medal,
sergeant? What it means?

592
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,197
Sure. I can use the extra
2 bucks a month.

593
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,469
- When's that start, major?
- As soon as Congress approves it.

594
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,352
I guess we're finished, sergeant.

595
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,275
You've been asking me plenty and
writing it down in that book of yours.

596
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,795
I ask you something
and you don't answer. Why?

597
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,076
I said we're finished, sergeant.

598
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,509
- Major?
- What is it you want?

599
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,670
I'm a pretty sick man, major.

600
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,348
No matter what the medics say.
Short-winded. One leg is stiff.

601
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,794
Rheumatism.

602
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,396
- Yes?
- I've been in the cavalry a long time.

603
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:16,236
I'd retire, but half a corporal's pay
ain't enough. You know that.

604
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,390
- What is it you want?
- Sir, when we get to base...

605
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,950
...l'd think it mighty kind of you
to transfer me to the quartermaster.

606
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,395
Maybe driving one of them trucks.

607
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,997
When a man's put in a long stretch
of faithful duty...

608
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,230
...he's entitled to consideration.

609
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,915
I'm a little too old for combat, major.

610
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,911
Let the young fight,
and save them boys...

611
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,877
...who've already served
their country.

612
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,350
- Take you out of combat?
- Yeah.

613
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,512
How can you tell me
you're too old and feeble to fight...

614
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,956
...when you fought as you did at Ojos?
Tell me that.

615
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,031
Listen to me, Trubee...

616
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,874
...l'll think it over.

617
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,430
But you have to tell me
what made you charge that corral.

618
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:02,037
I want to know what you felt
and what you thought...

619
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,158
...before you left the troop
and started out alone.

620
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,195
I don't know, major. I don't know.

621
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,472
Try to remember, Trubee.

622
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,200
A and D troops were pinned down
by crossfire.

623
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,112
Somebody had to get to that corral...

624
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,113
...and cause enough damage
so the troops could get through.

625
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,350
Yes, I seen them Mexicans there.

626
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,353
So you lit out on your own to save
the men of those troops.

627
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,953
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, sir.

628
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,634
You knew you might not make it,
but you had to try.

629
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,190
It was a...
It was a conscious act of self-sacrifice.

630
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,191
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, sir, major.

631
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,920
You put that in writing
and I'll swear to it.

632
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,072
- You'll swear to it?
- Indeed I will, major. Indeed I will.

633
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,596
You lied, damn you.

634
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,230
If there's one piece of truth
in your insect soul, I want it.

635
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,436
You lied, didn't you?
It isn't true, is it?

636
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,160
If you say so, it is.
If you say it ain't, it ain't.

637
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,709
I know my place.
I've been busted three times.

638
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,269
When an officer puts words
in my mouth, I let him.

639
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,597
But I don't see I give you proper
cause to lay hands on me.

640
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,073
- Have I, sarge?
- You're on guard.

641
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,756
I'm at my position, major.
I'm watching.

642
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,190
And listening for my answer.

643
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,477
- When you plan to take us out of here?
- That is my business.

644
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:17,111
It's my business too. The lieutenant
tells me that you aim to keep us here.

645
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,395
The lieutenant had no right.

646
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,320
- Right or wrong, you want my advice?
- I don't.

647
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,074
I don't need tactics
from enlisted personnel.

648
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:30,711
I may take you out, I may not. In either
case it'll be my decision, not yours.

649
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,470
If you don't take us out, maybe I will.

650
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,716
Not while I'm alive to give orders.

651
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,753
It's daybreak, sir.
It's been quiet.

652
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:36,874
Major, this is my last cigarette...

653
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,508
...so I'm gonna offer you
a safe way out.

654
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,831
He's not really after us.

655
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,470
Did you notice yesterday some of their
horses were being ridden double?

656
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,714
- That's what he wants.
- Horses?

657
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,314
He could have a little fun
by tying you all down...

658
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,994
...riding back and forth
over you until you all die.

659
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,515
But at this point he has to be practical.

660
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,593
So my hunch is he wants
the horses, not us.

661
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,672
If I were you, I'd let him have them...

662
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,513
...on the chance
he may call off the siege.

663
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:12,075
I'm doing you no favour. I just
happen to be fond of my own skin.

664
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,551
So think it over, major.

665
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,913
But not for long.

666
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,554
And now have the men untie
the horses and turn them loose.

667
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,114
It's as unthinkable as surrendering.

668
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,071
Another day without water,
and they won't be worth keeping.

669
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,310
We'll have to walk it to base
either way.

670
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,913
We can manage a two-day walk.

671
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,992
- Why not give them our weapons too?
- Don't be a fool.

672
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,673
It's a gamble, I admit.

673
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,550
If we lose, and they don't pull out,
we'll be no worse off than we are now.

674
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,950
I'm willing to gamble to save our skins.

675
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:15,477
For the U.S. Cavalry to give up
its horses to the enemy is cowardice.

676
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,950
And I protest it formally.

677
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,269
I want you men to remember that
for the record.

678
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,795
That as an officer
I protested any such act.

679
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,711
Give your orders.

680
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,391
Lead them out and turn them loose.

681
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:39,119
If this don't work, this is the last order
you're ever going to give.

682
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,679
Move.

683
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,200
- How many miles you figure to base?
- Forty, more or less.

684
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,714
- How many miles you figure to base?
- Forty, more or less.

685
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,719
If my calculations are right...

686
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:42,317
...we ought to hit the Tex-Mex
railroad tomorrow afternoon...

687
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,869
...then follow it right on into base.

688
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,035
- We gotta take her with us, huh?
- Yes.

689
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,236
Feed her out of our grub?

690
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,312
I don't understand Spanish,
but I understand enough to know...

691
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,029
...that she was yelling
to Arreaga to kill us.

692
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,034
We have no choice.
She's a military prisoner.

693
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:14,192
I want to say something to all of you
about my decision today.

694
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,993
If we had been on scout duty,
or supply or courier...

695
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,833
...I would have taken you out of here.

696
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:25,630
Most of us would have made it.
But you five have...

697
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,190
...had more than your share
of luck lately.

698
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:35,119
Congressional Medals of Honor
are usually awarded to the dead.

699
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,749
My duty was to get you to base...

700
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,515
...without losing one of you
to the law of averages.

701
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,434
You've heard about the war in Europe.

702
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:52,072
And just as sure as I'm kneeling here
our country will be in it soon.

703
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,196
We'll need heroes to look up to.

704
01:06:54,360 --> 01:07:00,515
To show us how to behave in battle.
And you will be our example.

705
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:05,396
You'll probably be sent home
on furlough...

706
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:09,792
...your pictures will be in the papers.
People will point you out in the streets.

707
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,278
But no matter what you do
from now on...

708
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,671
...you can never escape
your new selves.

709
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,596
That is why I had to see
that you were spared today.

710
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,038
- Coffee, major?
- Thank you.

711
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,037
- Begging the major's pardon.
- At ease. Just a minute.

712
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:14,709
- Well, Trubee?
- That was a right moving speech.

713
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,873
What is it you want?

714
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,110
No grudge about you
laying hands on me.

715
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,840
I don't carry a mean bone in my body.

716
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,514
But an ordinary soldier has
to look out for himself...

717
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,238
...or he'll be took advantage of.

718
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,757
Major, I know something
you may not figure I know.

719
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,478
And it puts me a leg up on you.

720
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,718
- Columbus?
- That's the short of it.

721
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,633
But I don't plan to make a stink
unless I have to.

722
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,910
There are two things I'm after. And
I don't see as you can turn me down.

723
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:57,119
One: I don't want no medal.
I don't hanker to be made a lead mule.

724
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:01,353
Two: I ain't had a woman
since we crossed the border.

725
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,919
You turn her over to me, and after I get
through she won't be so damn fancy.

726
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,351
You let me put the bit to her.

727
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,035
- She'd have given up U.S. Soldiers.
- That's enough!

728
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,918
Don't you rare up to me, major.

729
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,836
You're lucky
I kept my mouth shut this far.

730
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,309
Now, you give me the woman
instead of the medal.

731
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,438
You give me her or I'll raise
such hell about Columbus...

732
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,239
...you'll be the one in the stockade,
not old Milo.

733
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,754
Major, major.

734
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:39,239
- Major, I'm so sick.
- Better get some blankets.

735
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,516
I've been feeling poorly all day, sir.

736
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,069
But the run after that woman
brought the weakness on.

737
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,755
- I feel sick. Weak.
- You should have told me, son.

738
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:53,233
I didn't think I ought
with such a long hike ahead, sir.

739
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,834
I've never been so bad off before.

740
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,758
I think it's typhoid.

741
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:02,754
The fever will go up and down for a day.
If it breaks, he'll pull through.

742
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:08,069
- What'll take the fever down?
- Quinine, rubbing alcohol and water.

743
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,231
Rubbing alcohol.
You have some tequila...

744
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,311
...in your saddlebags.
Bring it over.

745
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,871
Have the men cut some wood
and build a litter. We've got to move.

746
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:20,272
Forty miles? We can't carry anybody
40 miles. The rest ain't up to make it.

747
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,557
We'll all make it.
Or none of us will.

748
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,597
Just as easy to leave
two behind as one.

749
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,949
I had one for the road.

750
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,073
Halt!

751
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,678
Renziehausen.
We change around. Chawk.

752
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,953
Will he pull through?

753
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,918
I don't know.
He has some kind of typhoid.

754
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:12,196
- You told Chawk about 40 miles.
- Give or take a few.

755
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,953
- Did you ever think he might be right?
- About what?

756
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:19,078
About the rest of us not making it
unless we travel light.

757
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,595
Don't let me hear that again.

758
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,954
For the Lord thy God
bringeth to a new land...

759
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,237
...a land of brooks, of water,
of fountains and depths.

760
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,710
Will you shut up? You nose-wiping,
holy-rolling preacher.

761
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,520
The tequila is almost gone.

762
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,717
I don't think he can stand
another day like this.

763
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,833
- How much quinine have you left?
- Ten.

764
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,829
We ought to try tomorrow to put him
on it before the fever starts up.

765
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,798
I gotta have some water.

766
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,471
I gotta have some water, major.

767
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,429
Just one capful, no more.

768
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,672
That's enough.

769
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,551
I said you had enough!

770
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,033
Get some rest.

771
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,317
Let her up.

772
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,752
If you try that again, I'll prefer charges
the day we get to base.

773
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,072
And what day might that be, major?

774
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,435
You don't know where
that railroad is anymore...

775
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,318
...than you know which end is up.

776
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,916
Prefer charges, huh?
I'll do the preferring.

777
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,356
You can't do nothing to nobody.
Tell the boys, major.

778
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,479
Tell them where they found them oak
leaves at Columbus. In a ditch, boys.

779
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,149
That's where he was while
we were fighting.

780
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,754
The dirty yellow-guts hid out
in a ditch!

781
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,549
If he'd been an ordinary soldier
like us, he'd be in Leavenworth.

782
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,314
The high mucky-muck is telling us
we're heroes, boys.

783
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,232
And trying to kill the lot of us.

784
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:25,109
I say blow him full of holes,
and let's find our own way home.

785
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:29,831
He won't shoot. He's a yellow-guts.
A yellow-guts!

786
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,355
Lieutenant, take their guns.

787
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,950
Mister, take their guns.

788
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,993
His too.

789
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,712
- Me, major, me?
- His too.

790
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:55,118
Now throw them away
as far as you can.

791
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,958
Now move.

792
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,433
You gonna get us to base, major?

793
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,239
We'll stand alternate guard tonight.

794
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,553
As far as I'm concerned, major,
you're on your own.

795
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,150
An officer's duty is to protect his kind,
but only to a point.

796
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,558
Covering up for cowardice
is beyond it.

797
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,075
Hearing Trubee has made
everything clear to me.

798
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,071
We've only been the means
of repairing...

799
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,629
...the damage done to your pride.

800
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,233
You can't be a hero yourself...

801
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,153
...but you can make as many heroes
as you want.

802
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,470
You're not trying to save
the men now...

803
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,995
...you're trying to keep
your own creations.

804
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,720
In the end we'll all die for your guilt.

805
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:57,235
If something should happen to you,
it'd be the best thing for all of us.

806
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,391
You need us, we don't need you.

807
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,519
Now, if something does happen...

808
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,996
...I won't participate,
but I won't lift a finger to prevent it.

809
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,837
Here's my gun.

810
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,795
Don't come any farther, sergeant.

811
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,437
I think it's time you and me
had a talk, major.

812
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,958
You wrote up that citation of mine yet?

813
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,154
Why?

814
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,716
What else you got wrote about me
in that book of yours?

815
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,118
You said something, that we'd get
in the papers about those medals.

816
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,992
You might.

817
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,717
- You mean, pictures of us?
- Probably.

818
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:48,950
I can't have that. You drove me hard
this trip already, but I won't have that.

819
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,271
Maybe you don't know it, but some
men go into service to hide out.

820
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:56,752
A horse, you know,
he don't ask no questions.

821
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,434
What are you driving at?

822
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,114
You write me up, and they read it
up in Albuquerque...

823
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,748
...and I'll have a rope
around my neck, not no medal.

824
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,834
- What for?
- Murder.

825
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:10,829
I got in a fight with a hunky
I was working with on the railroad.

826
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,355
The short of it is
I'm wanted for murder.

827
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,918
A year ago I was over in Tucson...

828
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,674
...they still had my picture up
in the post office.

829
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:22,150
So it's your medal or my neck.

830
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,196
I'm sorry, Chawk.
There's nothing I can do about it.

831
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,791
You mean you'll see me strung up?

832
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:35,396
No, I mean it's my duty
to write your citation.

833
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,789
You gutless jerk, this ain't Columbus.
There ain't no ditch you can jump into.

834
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,679
You'd faint before you'd pull
that trigger.

835
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,159
Try me.

836
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,597
I got nothing to lose, Thorn.

837
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,877
I gotta kill you.

838
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,158
I need help.

839
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,357
- Tequila.
- It's finished.

840
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,590
Give me two quinine.

841
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:55,398
Sleep, boy. Sleep.

842
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,752
How old are your children?

843
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,833
The boy was 5
when they took him away.

844
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,230
The girl a year younger.

845
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,752
Where are they?

846
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,239
I think he's falling asleep.

847
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,152
Don't go.

848
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,793
Have you ever talked to anyone
about Columbus?

849
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,599
No.

850
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,358
Do you want to talk to me about it?

851
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,433
Nobody expected Pancho Villa
to cross the border.

852
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,511
Most of us were asleep when,
suddenly...

853
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,636
...he struck in the middle of the night.

854
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,517
My father was a very brave man.
He was killed in action.

855
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,069
In all the years I had been
in the Army...

856
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,674
...l'd never seen danger
or been in action.

857
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,916
Suddenly there was firing.

858
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:04,837
I took my pistol and ran outside, then
started for Regimental Headquarters.

859
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,231
There was confusion.
There was chaos.

860
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,960
Very few of us knew
what was happening.

861
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,994
Some bullets went through
some leaves...

862
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,515
...of the tree right close to my face.

863
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:22,515
I was standing next to a culvert
running under a railway...

864
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,918
...and I took cover.

865
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,075
There's a moment in life when you
stop being several things...

866
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,118
...and become one thing.

867
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:41,831
When I left that ditch,
I became one thing.

868
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,592
A coward.

869
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,788
- What did you think during the fight?
- Nothing.

870
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:56,389
- And afterward?
- I became two men.

871
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,314
One can't stand living
in the same skin with the other.

872
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,510
Can you explain what you did?
Even to yourself?

873
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,556
I've got no excuse.

874
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,149
One act of cowardice doesn't
make a man a coward forever.

875
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:17,313
Just as one act of bravery
doesn't make a man a hero forever.

876
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:23,434
What will happen if we reach Cordura
and Trubee talks?

877
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:28,276
Oh, it'll spread. Pressure will build up,
and they'll have to wash the dirty linen.

878
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,390
- What will that do to you?
- Dishonourable discharge.

879
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,630
A resignation at least.

880
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:39,318
Trubee doesn't want the citation.

881
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:42,950
- He gave you a choice.
- I can't take it.

882
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,515
How long must you go on atoning?

883
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:53,789
I'm not. What I'm doing is for them.
Not for me.

884
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,271
Otherwise, it has no meaning.

885
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:05,272
- You still think that they deserve...
- They do. They do.

886
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,394
You're still in that
railroad ditch at Columbus...

887
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:12,314
...unable, or afraid, to see out of it.

888
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,350
Heroes? Saints living in the desert?

889
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,317
Oh, my God.

890
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:22,712
They tried to rape me
and blackmail you.

891
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,388
It's a wonder they haven't
shot you already. No, Thorn...

892
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:32,038
...they're only men.
And damn poor specimens at that.

893
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:36,149
I have less right than
any man on earth to judge them.

894
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,515
Or to judge yourself, either.

895
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:43,874
You may be right what you say.
They're human beings.

896
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,793
But they're more than that.
They have one thing in them...

897
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,349
...that is a miracle and a mystery.

898
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,238
It redeems them.

899
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:54,198
They don't know themselves what it is,
but they have it.

900
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,116
I have to save it.

901
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,835
You really believe this.

902
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,711
If you do, Thorn...

903
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:12,515
...if you do,
you may be worth all of them.

904
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:20,868
I have to turn in. Another day like this
and I'll be a litter case.

905
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:25,669
And so will you,
if you don't spare yourself.

906
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:31,079
Why don't you let the lieutenant
take a turn at standing guard?

907
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:32,832
I'll do that.

908
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,389
Got an "officers only" sign
on her, major?

909
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:00,232
Now you wouldn't gun me, major.

910
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,675
It'd be a mighty sinful thing to do.

911
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,876
Kill a hero?

912
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:20,311
You honestly think
you can wait me out?

913
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:23,275
Don't you close your eyes, Thorn.

914
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,674
Don't you even blink.

915
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:53,633
Water!

916
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,909
Don't drink that!
I order you not to drink that!

917
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:09,119
You'll be sick, all of you. Sick!
This water's alkaline.

918
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:13,353
- We'll find water at the railroad soon.
- What railroad, major?

919
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:17,196
There ain't no railroad. Nothing.

920
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,397
I don't believe you, major.
I just don't believe you.

921
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:50,070
I signed up for the Army
to be shut of the railroad.

922
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,429
I'll be a brass monkey,
here I am again.

923
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,435
How far is it to base now, major?

924
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,552
I don't know.

925
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,036
What's down the other end?

926
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:20,157
Chihuahua City.

927
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,595
Why don't we be democratic, major?

928
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,672
Them that wants to go south
and back to the regiment can.

929
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,156
Them that wants to go north
and be heroes...

930
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,709
...or get kicked out of the Army
can do that.

931
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:38,832
Let's go.

932
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:27,593
Trubee, get up.

933
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,230
I ain't carrying him no further!
You hear me, major?

934
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,271
He's gonna die anyways.

935
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,830
You can leave him or tote him,
but I ain't. I'm finished.

936
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,595
We're all gonna die
in this God-forgot country.

937
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,751
And the buzzards will pick us clean.

938
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:45,992
And they'll say to our skeletons
what heroes we was.

939
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:49,755
Trubee. Get on that litter.
That's an order.

940
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,990
You wouldn't let that alkali
go through you.

941
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:56,199
He knows how you feel, Milo.
He had it at Columbus.

942
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,476
It wasn't from drinking alkali water.

943
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:03,918
We're going on. We made the railroad.
That's the last lap.

944
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:07,356
Cordura can be behind
any one of those hills.

945
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:11,832
If we're close to base, why not leave
him and send a detail back after him?

946
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,752
Or don't you really know how close?

947
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,630
Make up your mind, Trubee.

948
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,112
On your feet or I'll wing you.

949
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,510
You shoot me
and my kids will have no father.

950
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,398
Up.

951
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:32,234
I gave you an inch.
The next time I won't.

952
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,392
- Now get on that litter.
- Take him, sarge! Take him.

953
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:38,028
He won't shoot to kill.
Can't you see it?

954
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,668
Might as well get off your tail, Milo.

955
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,111
I plan to take this buzzard
any time now.

956
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:46,397
The first time he turns around
or goes down, he's mine.

957
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:21,148
Sergeant, you worked on the railroad.
Do you think this thing'll run?

958
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,877
- Lf it does we can ride to base.
- Only one way to find out.

959
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,430
- Push it on the tracks.
- Chawk, you crazy helping him?

960
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,192
Push.

961
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:52,595
Ladies and gents,
this is the Spitball Express.

962
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,069
Heroes ride free.

963
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,150
Ladies at their own risk.

964
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:03,236
As far as majors go, the end of the line
comes a lot sooner than they think.

965
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,636
All aboard!

966
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,233
Take a minute.

967
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,473
Major, I've been meaning
to tell you, sir.

968
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,191
I told you a real whopping lie.

969
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:11,713
I really was scared in that fight.
That's why I bit my chin strap through.

970
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,519
I bet I was as scared
as you were at Columbus.

971
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,513
Really?

972
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:19,679
Not quite.

973
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,310
So, major, would you please
not put me in for the Medal of Honor?

974
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:26,599
- Why?
- Because I won't go home.

975
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:30,548
Not looking like this. I'm never gonna
go home again in my whole life.

976
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:44,912
Thorn!

977
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,189
Take off them guns
and let's have it out!

978
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,271
Come on, best men take over!

979
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:53,471
Get back on this car.

980
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:57,438
You gotta keel over some time.

981
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,793
You gotta close your eyes just once.

982
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,276
Could we have gone too far north
and not enough east?

983
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,473
I mean, we could be above base,
not below.

984
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:36,512
I don't think so.

985
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,951
- Then why aren't we there?
- I don't know.

986
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:45,116
If we should be north of it,
what's the next town?

987
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:49,392
I'm not sure. Probably Dublan.

988
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,915
How far?

989
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:56,154
Fifty miles, maybe.

990
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,277
I can't go on.

991
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,996
We have to do something.

992
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:08,070
Chawk's the strongest.

993
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,913
Let him follow the railroad
to the nearest town.

994
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,992
He can send back help,
food and water.

995
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,918
Don't you see what he's doing?

996
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,674
He's trying to kill us one by one.

997
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:25,675
Making us give up our horses
so we can't get to base and talk.

998
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:29,515
Marching us until we're ready to drop
and he's the only one left.

999
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:33,038
He knows where we are!

1000
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,156
Don't you see it?

1001
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:41,519
- You ignorant pigs!
- Shut up!

1002
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:47,073
I don't know about water,
but we could eat.

1003
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:49,949
Depends on
the preacher boy up there.

1004
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:53,199
He might be stringy,
but he's been cooking a long time.

1005
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,238
I order you to follow
that railroad to the nearest town.

1006
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,111
Did you hear me?

1007
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,870
Go to bed, Georgie.

1008
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,429
Me and the major is gonna sit up
together tonight.

1009
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:10,955
And in the morning, I give the orders.

1010
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:15,072
Is it a small thing that thou
hast brought us up out of a land...

1011
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,276
...that floweth with milk and honey?

1012
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:22,798
- "Land of milk and honey."
- To kill us in the wilderness?

1013
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,589
Except thou make thyself...
A prince over us.

1014
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:29,672
"Prince over us." Amen.
Sing out, preacher boy.

1015
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,149
- Sing out with some...
- Father.

1016
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,033
Father?

1017
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,357
Father.

1018
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:25,798
You've no right to ask a woman
to bear this.

1019
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:27,712
I can't go on.

1020
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:31,908
I don't care if he dies.
I don't care if they all die.

1021
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:35,277
They can get their medals in hell.
That's where they're going.

1022
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:39,274
And as for you, Thorn, you're crazy.
Military crazy.

1023
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,073
And I hope they kill you
and put you out of your misery.

1024
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:47,118
I swear to heaven I do.

1025
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,754
<i>Snak es in the mountains</i>
<i>Eels in the sea</i>

1026
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:58,188
I can't remember the rest of that song.

1027
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,829
I've known that for years.
I can't remember.

1028
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:03,714
Major.

1029
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:09,788
You think it's anything got to do with
that smack I got on the head?

1030
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:17,069
Funny, I'm always getting hit
in the same place.

1031
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:19,117
Right on the head.

1032
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:23,158
I remember when I was a kid.
I was just a...

1033
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,630
My old man gave me a whipping.

1034
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,795
He took the belly band
off some harness and...

1035
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,629
Boy, did he give it to me. Wham!

1036
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,677
Right on the head, he give it to me.

1037
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,790
I remember that, all right.

1038
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:45,033
I remember.
I remember when I paid him back.

1039
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,270
Years later,
I paid him back the same way.

1040
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,512
Wham! I mean, right across it.

1041
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,634
How are you going to stay awake?

1042
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,712
Don't know.

1043
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:03,229
Proud of myself.
First time in long time.

1044
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:09,596
And when he comes for you,
you won't shoot him.

1045
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,870
- I would.
- Hey, major.

1046
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:15,800
Maybe you know some Mexican song.

1047
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,234
- Give me the gun!
- No!

1048
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,118
I'll stand watch.

1049
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,788
Please try to understand.

1050
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:29,236
Hey, major. Let's hear you sing now.

1051
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:32,872
Come on, give us a song.

1052
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,717
Sleep.

1053
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:00,714
I can give you sleep.

1054
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:58,352
I'm ashamed of what I've been
all my life.

1055
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,880
My fault, not yours.

1056
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,275
My guilt, not yours.

1057
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:19,593
The ranch at Ojos Azules...

1058
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:22,320
...that was my culvert.

1059
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:27,595
The railroad ditch into which I crawled,
just like you did at Columbus.

1060
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,152
Trying to...

1061
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:35,318
...shut out a world that frightened me,
that I hated.

1062
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:38,476
Most of all, I guess...

1063
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,475
...I hated myself.

1064
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,473
Here.

1065
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:10,514
In this are their citations.

1066
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:17,357
If anything happens to me, keep it and
turn it in to the commander at Cordura.

1067
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,360
Swear you'll do this for me.

1068
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,475
I swear.

1069
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:27,632
Thank you.

1070
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:42,634
You're the bravest man
I've ever known.

1071
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:58,910
Now, that's all right, boy.

1072
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:02,192
I opened my eyes this morning
and I wasn't sick any more.

1073
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:05,750
I knew who you were. I knew everyone.

1074
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:08,310
Major, it's the work of the Lord.

1075
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:13,315
The Lord spared me because
I've, I have had true faith in him.

1076
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:15,757
He spared me.

1077
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,955
Better get back on the car.

1078
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:30,713
- Hungry. Thirsty.
- Feed the boy, major. Feed him.

1079
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:33,348
Give him food. Give him water.

1080
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,556
Give him a woman.

1081
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:43,430
My shoes. Where are my shoes?

1082
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,238
I...

1083
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,351
I threw them away.

1084
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,274
Why?

1085
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:51,716
Look, I don't know why.

1086
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:55,868
Well, they were all ripped up.
You know, like my ear's all ripped up.

1087
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:58,759
When we get to base, I'm gonna buy
you a pair of shoes...

1088
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:01,673
...get me a new ear
and we're going on a date together.

1089
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:04,593
No girl's gonna look at you
without no ear.

1090
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:09,149
The major said they can
make me a new ear out of rubber.

1091
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:11,959
So good nobody'll ever know it.
Fastens on with wax.

1092
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:13,473
Do you believe that?

1093
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:17,038
You'll be loving up some doll,
she'll yank it right off you.

1094
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:18,918
Let him alone.

1095
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,150
You know something, squarehead...

1096
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,596
...you ought to join up
with some freak show.

1097
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:35,520
I'll finish the job for him.

1098
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:01,675
It's a good thing you're done there,
major. I'd have broke his back.

1099
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,397
On the handles.

1100
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,354
Major.

1101
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:20,432
I just can't make it.

1102
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:23,114
This time it's the truth, I swear it.

1103
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:25,398
I'm too tired.

1104
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:29,359
Get aboard the car.

1105
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:38,032
Renziehausen, on the handles.

1106
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:53,629
All right, walk ahead.

1107
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,713
Stay off the handles.
I'll do it myself.

1108
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,639
Get off!
Trubee, get off!

1109
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:30,636
Let go. You'll kill yourself.

1110
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,552
Let go!

1111
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:39,151
You'll kill yourself!

1112
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:41,470
You'll kill yourself!

1113
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:54,559
Is he dead?

1114
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:09,118
Not yet.

1115
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:19,920
All right, this is what happened:

1116
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:23,550
Major Thorn surrendered the horses,
and we were ambushed again.

1117
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:25,676
Another ambush.

1118
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:29,355
We drove them back but the major was
killed by the Mexicans. Is that clear?

1119
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,478
Is it?

1120
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:33,872
Be sure it is. Be very sure.

1121
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:36,679
What about her?
She's gotta be shut up.

1122
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:39,150
You want to go back to Ojos,
don't you?

1123
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:45,156
No need telling you what's in the store
for you at base, is there? Is there?

1124
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:51,830
I'm an officer and gentleman. By Act
of Congress, officer and gentleman.

1125
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,230
So you keep quiet
and you can return to Ojos...

1126
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:57,995
Wait a minute, hold it.
That black book of his. Where is it?

1127
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:00,553
I forgot.

1128
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:03,955
The citations, I forgot.

1129
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,949
- Where are they?
- He burned them.

1130
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:12,590
- You're lying.
- I'm not. He burned them this morning.

1131
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:15,149
- You're lying!
- He said you weren't fit to have them.

1132
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:17,880
- Give them to me.
- He burned them.

1133
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,559
Now I'll burn them.

1134
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,994
- Wait, I want to see that first.
- Lieutenant Fowler.

1135
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:24,878
Let me see it!

1136
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:35,354
"For gallantry, risk of life,
upon his own decision...

1137
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:38,318
...and with total disregard
for his own life...

1138
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:43,349
...Lieutenant Fowler, acting in
the highest tradition of the service...

1139
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:45,476
...displayed courage."

1140
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:49,591
"Pinned down
by murderous crossfire...

1141
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:53,196
...this veteran rose
to the heights of heroism."

1142
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:01,509
He sure blows a man up awful big,
don't he, Chawk?

1143
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:06,558
All right, let's tear them up.
Burn them and let's get out of here.

1144
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,790
What's he write about you, Chawk?

1145
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:11,593
The same kind of stuff.

1146
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:14,638
He... He's wrote something else here.

1147
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,995
It's kind of scribbled.

1148
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:21,676
"All of them, Fowler, Trubee, Chawk,
all of them...

1149
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:27,152
...alike to each other,
as I am alike to all of them.

1150
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:31,913
In each of us,
there lives a crippled child...

1151
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:34,599
...mostly Chawk."

1152
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,431
Crippled child...

1153
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:47,433
"Times when I feel that he,
others, not worth citations.

1154
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,750
Treacherous, vicious...

1155
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:51,911
...dishonest.

1156
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:56,509
They are also brave...

1157
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:58,433
...noble.

1158
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:09,277
I've seen them at Ojos. Perhaps,
for another moment in their lives...

1159
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:15,037
...they will live again
beyond the limit of human conduct.

1160
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:18,228
That's why must make Cordura...

1161
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:23,357
...prove something else
also lives in men."

1162
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:27,953
He's got something here
he's crossed out.

1163
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:33,193
"Judge not, lest ye be judged."

1164
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:42,473
He crossed it out,
and then he wrote it again.
