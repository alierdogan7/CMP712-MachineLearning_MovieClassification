00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,240
Man: HEAR THAT?

17
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:19,973
MIGHT SAY I WAS RAISED
ON THAT SONG.

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,540
HEARING IT TAKES ME BACK--

19
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:24,640
BACK TO THE OLD TIMES
WHEN I WAS YOUNG,

20
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:27,906
BACK TO WALESBURG.

21
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:29,407
ACCORDING TO THE WORDS
OF THE SONG,

22
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:32,407
WE'RE PROMISED A CITY OF GOLD
IN THE HEREAFTER.

23
00:01:32,473 --> 00:01:36,073
I USED TO THINK THAT WAS
A LONG TIME TO HAVE TO WAIT.

24
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,407
BUT I KNOW NOW THAT
THERE IS A CITY OF GOLD

25
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,173
RIGHT HERE ON EARTH
FOR EVERY ONE OF US--

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,739
THE CITY OF OUR YOUTH.

27
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:47,106
WALESBURG'S ONLY ONE
NAME FOR IT; THAT'S ALL.

28
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:51,106
WALESBURG NOT AS IT IS NOW,
BUT AS IT USED TO BE.

29
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:54,273
I JUST HAVE TO SHUT MY EYES,
AND I'M THERE.

30
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,940
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

31
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:58,140
EVEN I HAVEN'T CHANGED.

32
00:01:58,207 --> 00:02:00,940
I'M ALWAYS A BOY
IN WALESBURG.

33
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:05,906
AND THERE AT MY SIDE,
JUST AS HE'LL ALWAYS BE,
IS THE PARSON--PARSON GRAY.

34
00:02:05,973 --> 00:02:11,473
AND PASSING BEFORE ME ARE
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE
A PART OF MY GROWING UP--

35
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,373
PEOPLE LIKE MRS. BELCHER,
WHO TOOK IN BOARDERS,

36
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,674
AND HER NIECE FAITH SAMUELS,
THE DISTRICT SCHOOLTEACHER.

37
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:19,873
SWEET, PRETTY
MISS SAMUELS.

38
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,373
DID YOU
HEAR THAT, JOHN?

39
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,207
GRANNY GAILBRAITH,
WHO COULD REMEMBER

40
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:26,006
SEEING GEORGE WASHINGTON.

41
00:02:26,073 --> 00:02:30,140
THAD CARROLL, WHO HAD
SERVED AS DRUMMER BOY
AT THE FIRST BULL RUN.

42
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:37,340
LON BACKETT, WHO KEPT
THE GENERAL STORE AND HAD
A FINGER IN EVERY PIE.

43
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,906
EVEN CHLOROFORM WIGGINS.

44
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:43,373
HIS MA HAD NEVER HEARD
OF CHLOROFORM UNTIL HE WAS BORN,

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,773
AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS
A MIGHTY PRETTY NAME.

46
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:50,006
AND ALL THE OTHERS,

47
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:52,273
WALESBURG PEOPLE.

48
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,006
GONE NOW, MOST OF THEM,

49
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:59,340
AND YET AS CLOSE TO ME STILL
AS PEOPLE IN A FAVORITE STORY--

50
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:02,307
A STORY THAT HAD ITS BEGINNING
BEFORE I WAS BORN

51
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:05,640
ON THE DAY THE PARSON
ARRIVED IN OUR TOWN.

52
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:07,207
OF COURSE, THIS WASN'T
MUCH OF A TOWN THEN

53
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:08,373
IN THOSE
FIRST HARD YEARS

54
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,207
THAT FOLLOWED
THE WAR BETWEEN THE STATES,

55
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:12,574
BUT IT SUITED
THE PARSON

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,540
RIGHT FROM THE MINUTE
HE STEPPED OFF THE TRAIN

57
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:16,373
AND STARTED
TO LOOK AROUND.

58
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,839
[TRAIN WHISTLES]

59
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:26,440
HE MUST HAVE ATTRACTED
PLENTY OF ATTENTION

60
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:29,640
AS HE WALKED DOWN MAIN STREET
FOR THE FIRST TIME

61
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:31,574
IN HIS BRAND-NEW
BLACK PULPIT COAT

62
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,706
AND FADED GRAY
CAVALRY BREECHES

63
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,040
AND HIS BIG OLD
BIBLE IN HIS HAND.

64
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:40,140
BUT HE JUST KEPT ON WALKING TILL
HE GOT TO JERRY HIGGINS' SALOON.

65
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:41,806
[MEN TALKING
AND LAUGHING]

66
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:49,574
HE DIDN'T HAVE
TO CALL FOR QUIET.

67
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,507
IT JUST FOLLOWED HIM THROUGH
THAT ROOM LIKE A HOUND DOG.

68
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:57,373
BOYS, I'M YOUR
NEW PREACHER,

69
00:03:57,473 --> 00:03:59,540
AND I AIM TO GIVE
MY FIRST SERMON
RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

70
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:00,706
[LAUGHING]

71
00:04:05,873 --> 00:04:05,940
THANKS.

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,307
NOW, SEEING THAT
THIS IS AS NEW TO ME
AS IT IS TO YOU...

73
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,407
I RECKON
WE'D BEST BEGIN
AT THE BEGINNING.

74
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:23,373
"IN THE BEGINNING
WAS THE WORD,

75
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,706
"AND THE WORD
WAS WITH GOD.

76
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:27,473
AND THE WORD
WAS GOD."

77
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,706
Narrator:
FROM THAT DAY ON,

78
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:32,307
WALESBURG AND THE PARSON
KIND OF GREW UP TOGETHER.

79
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,040
HE PREACHED AROUND
IN BACK ROOMS,

80
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:35,540
AND HE PRAYED
IN PARLORS,

81
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:38,173
AND HE LED
THE SINGING IN BARNS.

82
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,173
* SHALL WE GATHER
AT THE RIVER *

83
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,640
* WHERE BRIGHT ANGEL FEET
HAVE TROD *

84
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:50,340
* WITH ITS CRYSTAL LIGHT
FOREVER *

85
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:55,040
* FLOWING BY
THE THRONE OF GOD *

86
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:59,640
* YES, WE'LL GATHER
AT THE RIVER *

87
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:04,140
* THE BEAUTIFUL,
THE BEAUTIFUL RIVER *

88
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:08,040
* GATHER WITH THE SAINTS
AT THE RIVER *

89
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:13,839
* THAT FLOWS
BY THE THRONE OF GOD *

90
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:17,540
Narrator: AND BY THE TIME WORK
STARTED ON THE PARSON'S CHURCH,

91
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:19,839
HIS VICTORY WAS WON.

92
00:05:19,906 --> 00:05:24,106
JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY
IN WALESBURG TOOK A HAND
IN THAT CHURCH BUILDING.

93
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:27,973
AND IF EVER A HOUSE OF GOD
OR MAN WAS PUT TOGETHER
WITH LOVING HANDS,

94
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,106
THIS ONE WAS.

95
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:35,373
YES, THE PARSON'S CHURCH
IS ONE OF THE NICEST PARTS
OF THE PARSON'S STORY.

96
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,706
AND NOW I WAS IN THE STORY, TOO.

97
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:41,607
HAD BEEN EVER SINCE
I COULD REMEMBER.

98
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,873
MY PARENTS HAD DIED
WHEN I WAS SMALL,

99
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,674
SO I'D COME TO LIVE
IN THE PARSON'S HOUSE,

100
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:50,140
SHARING THE PARSON'S HEART
WITH THE PARSON'S WIFE,

101
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,140
WHO WAS MY AUNT HARRIET.

102
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:53,173
[HUMMING]

103
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:58,173
WHAT'S THIS?
DINNER NOT READY YET?

104
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,040
GARFIELD, WE BETTER
GET A NEW COOK.

105
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:03,340
ENJOY THE SERVICE
THIS MORNING, HARRIET?

106
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:05,073
HUMPH.

107
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,473
WELL, NOW I'M
GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

108
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,674
EVERYONE ELSE WAS SAYING WHAT
A GOOD SERVICE IT WAS, TOO.

109
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:11,073
JOHN KENYON,
YOU KNOW,

110
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,607
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO EVERYTHING
THE PARSON DOES.

111
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,006
YES'M.

112
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:16,340
YOU KNOW,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

113
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:18,073
I THOUGHT IT WAS A PRETTY
GOOD SERVICE MYSELF.

114
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,940
DON'T YOU LAUGH
AT ME, MR. GRAY.

115
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,674
WHY, HARRIET, HONEY,

116
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:24,073
WHAT GIVES YOU THE IDEA
I'M LAUGHING AT YOU?

117
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,106
HERE I AM STANDING AROUND
WITH A BIG SMILE ON MY FACE

118
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:27,373
JUST 'CAUSE
I FEEL GOOD,
AND YOU--

119
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,706
YES, WELL, ALL
I HAVE TO SAY IS,

120
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:31,006
YOU OUGHT TO FEEL
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.

121
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:32,507
I WAS BROUGHT UP
TO BELIEVE

122
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:34,540
THAT A MAN WHO BROKE
HIS SOLEMN PROMISE
TO A LADY

123
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:36,373
WAS A PRETTY POOR
SORT OF A MAN.

124
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,873
OH, HARRIET, I GUESS
YOU FOUND ME OUT.

125
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,706
I AM A PRETTY
POOR SORT OF MAN.

126
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:42,540
I WAS INTENDING
TO MENTION IT SOONER.

127
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:43,739
SOMETHING ALWAYS
CAME UP.

128
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,607
THIS MORNING WAS
JUST THE LAST STRAW.

129
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:48,106
YOU KNOW YOU
PROMISED ME TIME
AND TIME AND AGAIN

130
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:50,240
THAT AS LONG AS
I PLAYED THE ORGAN
FOR THE SERVICES,

131
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:51,674
I COULD CHOOSE
THE HYMNS.

132
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:52,806
SO I HAVE.

133
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:54,640
YES, AND PROMISE
IS ALL YOU DO.

134
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,006
NEVER MIND WHAT
I WANT TO SING;

135
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:58,173
WHAT ANYBODY ELSE
IN WALESBURG WANTS
TO SING.

136
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,006
OH, NO, WEEK IN,
WEEK OUT,

137
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:02,973
<i>IT'S THAT OLD
STARS IN MY CROWN.</i>

138
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,340
<i>I LIKE
STARS IN MY CROWN.</i>

139
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:05,674
OH, I KNOW YOU DO,
MR. GRAY.

140
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:07,340
I ASSURE YOU, IT'S
COMMON KNOWLEDGE.

141
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:09,340
NEVER HEAR THE LAST
OF IT IN THIS WORLD.

142
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:10,940
AND I SUPPOSE
IF YOU HAVE YOUR WAY,

143
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:12,340
IT'LL BE THE SAME
IN THE NEXT.

144
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:15,440
JOHN, YOU PUT THOSE SHOES
AND STOCKINGS RIGHT BACK ON.

145
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:17,273
THEY MAKE MY FEET HOT.

146
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,574
I DON'T CARE.
YOU'RE NOT

147
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,839
GOING TO RUN
AROUND BAREFOOT
ON THE SABBATH.

148
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:20,773
IT ISN'T
RESPECTFUL.

149
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,706
SHOO.

150
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:23,140
John:
AW, GARFIELD.

151
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:24,407
LANGUAGE?

152
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,739
NOW, JOHN,
DO EXACTLY AS YOUR
AUNT HARRIET SAYS.

153
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:29,073
ANY WOMAN WHO CAN
BAKE A CHOCOLATE CAKE
AS GOOD AS THIS

154
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,806
DESERVES ALL THE
CONSIDERATION
SHE CAN GET.

155
00:07:31,873 --> 00:07:33,006
NOW, HARRIET, HONEY,

156
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:34,540
ABOUT THIS
HYMN BUSINESS.

157
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:36,040
IT'S FOR YOU TO SAY
WHAT YOU WANT DONE

158
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:37,373
AND FOR ME
TO DO IT.

159
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,407
DON'T BE SHY
ABOUT EXPRESSING
YOUR DESIRES.

160
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:40,540
JUST SPEAK
RIGHT UP,

161
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:42,040
AND I WON'T OPEN
MY MOUTH...

162
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:43,607
EXCEPT TO DO
THE PREACHING.

163
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:45,706
IF THE DAY EVER COMES
WHEN YOU DON'T
OPEN YOUR MOUTH...

164
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:47,373
THAT'S MY
LAST WORD, HARRIET--

165
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,906
EXCEPT TO DO
THE PREACHING.

166
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,273
* WILL THERE BE
ANY STARS *

167
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,273
* ANY STARS
IN MY CROWN *

168
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,440
* WHEN AT EVENING

00:49:45,973 --> 00:49:47,373
YOU'RE
MIGHTY WELCOME
TO COME AROUND

1020
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,940
AFTER THE SHOW
AND ASK FOR IT.

1021
00:49:49,006 --> 00:49:50,940
JUST BRING ALONG
YOUR PAPER
AND YOUR PENCIL

1022
00:49:51,006 --> 00:49:52,873
AND SOME
SMELLING SALTS,
THAT'S ALL.

1023
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,207
NOW A PINCH
OF BAKING SODA.

1024
00:49:54,273 --> 00:49:55,373
WE'LL PUT THAT
IN THERE.

1025
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,873
SOME MELTED
CANDLE WAX,

1026
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,706
AND HOW
ABOUT IT, MEN--

1027
00:49:59,773 --> 00:50:00,940
WOULDN'T YOU
LIKE TO SEE

1028
00:50:01,006 --> 00:50:02,806
SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ON THE TABLE
FOR A CHANGE?

1029
00:50:02,873 --> 00:50:03,873
Man: SURE WOULD!

1030
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,373
WELL, YOU JUST ASK
FOR DELICIOUS,

1031
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,373
PERNICIOUS
PICKAPOO PUDDIN'.

1032
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,440
NOW I WILL
FINISH IT OFF

1033
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,440
WITH A DASH
OF THIS FAMOUS
PICKAPOO EXTRACT.

1034
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:14,873
WE'LL GARNISH IT
WITH A TAIL FEATHER
OF A TOM TURKEY.

1035
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,873
WE'LL LET IT
SIMMER AWHILE,

1036
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,873
PUT THE LID DOWN
ON IT TIGHT CLOSED--

1037
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,806
HOLD THAT,
BOY, WILL YOU?

1038
00:50:20,873 --> 00:50:23,307
NOW WE'LL REPEAT
THE MAGIC FORMULA--
ABBADICKADABBA

1039
00:50:23,373 --> 00:50:26,739
DUZZA DUZZA BUZZA

PRESTO CHANGO,

1040
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:28,473
AND THERE'S
YOUR PUDDING.

1041
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,407
WELL, DON'T YOU
WANT TO SEE HOW
IT TURNED OUT, SON?

1042
00:50:30,473 --> 00:50:32,674
COME ON, LET'S
HAVE A LOOK AT IT.

1043
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:34,607
[LAUGHTER]

1044
00:50:46,973 --> 00:50:50,473
THAT'S ALL TODAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1045
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,140
NOW, IF YOU FOLKS
WILL GATHER IN HERE
A LITTLE BIT CLOSER,

1046
00:50:53,207 --> 00:50:55,373
WHEN YOU HEAR
THE NAME OF MY PRODUCT,

1047
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,940
OLD JONES'
LODESTONE TONIC,

1048
00:50:57,006 --> 00:50:59,873
WELL, FRIENDS,
THERE ARE JUST 3 WORDS
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER.

1049
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,873
WHAT ARE THESE 3 WORDS,
MY FRIENDS?

1050
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,373
"THERE IS HOPE,"
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE.

1051
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,373
NOW, FRIENDS, I DON'T CARE
WHAT'S YOUR AILMENT--

1052
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,373
BE IT THE LIGHTS
OR THE LIVER,

1053
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,207
BE IT THE NERVES
OF THE ORGAN,

1054
00:51:10,273 --> 00:51:12,873
BE IT RECURRING,
MALIGNANT, EPIDEMIC...

1055
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,739
Gray: FETCH
YOUNG DOC HARRIS.

1056
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,973
HE DIDN'T EAT
MUCH SUPPER
TO SPEAK OF.

1057
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,273
WE THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST THE EXCITEMENT
OF THE SHOW.

1058
00:51:46,973 --> 00:51:49,340
I'M AFRAID
IT'S TYPHOID.

1059
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:50,574
SLOW FEVER?

1060
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,207
WHAT CAN WE DO?

1061
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,407
NOT MUCH.

1062
00:51:56,473 --> 00:51:58,873
KEEP HIM
AS COMFORTABLE
AS POSSIBLE.

1063
00:52:03,006 --> 00:52:05,739
GIVE HIM
A SPOONFUL OF THIS
IF HE GETS RESTLESS.

1064
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,240
AND ICE WHEN
THE FEVER'S BAD.

1065
00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:25,873
NOW, LISTEN.

1066
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,373
HE'S YOUNG,
AND HE'S STRONG.

1067
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,373
HE'S GOT EVERYTHING
ON HIS SIDE.

1068
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,940
WITH A LITTLE LUCK,
THERE'S NO REASON

1069
00:52:31,006 --> 00:52:33,240
WHY HE SHOULDN'T
COME THROUGH THIS
ALL RIGHT.

1070
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:54,273
John: LET'S GO DOWN
TO THE CREEK.

1071
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,340
LET'S GO SWIMMING.

1072
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:58,839
LET'S HAVE
A DRINK.

1073
00:52:58,906 --> 00:53:02,773
I'M THIRSTY--
AWFUL THIRSTY.

1074
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:05,340
THE SUN'S SO HOT.

1075
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,574
LET'S PUT OUR HEADS
IN THE WATER.

1076
00:53:17,773 --> 00:53:19,873
YOU HAVEN'T
SLEPT FOR DAYS.

1077
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,307
I'M GONNA
PUT YOU TO BED.

1078
00:53:21,373 --> 00:53:23,440
I'M NOT TIRED.

1079
00:53:23,507 --> 00:53:25,940
JUST LIE DOWN
A LITTLE WHILE,
HONEY.

1080
00:53:26,006 --> 00:53:27,373
I'LL BE
RIGHT HERE
ALL THE TIME.

1081
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,373
I'LL CALL YOU
IF ANYTHING--

1082
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,706
REMEMBER WHAT
THE DOCTOR SAID?

1083
00:53:31,773 --> 00:53:33,407
IT'S UP
TO JOHN NOW.

1084
00:53:37,873 --> 00:53:39,073
THAT'S THE WAY.

1085
00:53:41,307 --> 00:53:43,674
DAYS SURE SEEM LIKE YEARS
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

1086
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,207
[SOBBING]

1087
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,373
ALL I CAN THINK OF
NOW IS THE TIMES

1088
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,373
I WASN'T SWEET
TO HIM;

1089
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,440
THE TIMES I SPOKE
SHARPLY TO HIM.

1090
00:54:23,507 --> 00:54:26,440
I DON'T KNOW
IF HE ALWAYS
UNDERSTOOD.

1091
00:54:26,507 --> 00:54:28,773
A LITTLE BOY
DOESN'T ALWAYS
UNDERSTAND THAT

1092
00:54:28,839 --> 00:54:31,906
YOU LOVE HIM
AND STILL SPEAK
SHARPLY TO HIM.

1093
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:38,440
IT'S SO HARD
TO KNOW.

1094
00:54:38,507 --> 00:54:44,373
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
JUST THE SAME
AS MY OWN TO ME--

1095
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,240
JUST EXACTLY
THE SAME.

1096
00:54:48,973 --> 00:54:51,340
MAYBE IT HASN'T BEEN
THE SAME FOR HIM.

1097
00:54:51,407 --> 00:54:53,340
I SUPPOSE
IT'S FOOLISH OF ME

1098
00:54:53,407 --> 00:54:55,873
TO THINK IT COULD
EVER BE THE SAME.

1099
00:54:58,674 --> 00:55:00,040
DON'T TALK, HONEY.

1100
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:11,839
I JUST WISH
I'D BEEN SWEETER
TO HIM, THAT'S ALL.

1101
00:55:11,906 --> 00:55:13,906
HE'S SUCH
A GOOD BOY.

1102
00:55:13,973 --> 00:55:16,806
HE'S NEVER
DONE ANYTHING
REALLY BAD.

1103
00:55:18,906 --> 00:55:20,873
I JUST WISH
I COULD TELL HIM

1104
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,640
WHAT A GOOD BOY
HE'S BEEN,

1105
00:55:23,706 --> 00:55:25,407
WHAT A BLESSING.

1106
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,906
HARRIET!

1107
00:56:30,873 --> 00:56:32,307
AUNT HARRIET?

1108
00:56:32,373 --> 00:56:33,806
YES, DEAR?

1109
00:56:33,873 --> 00:56:35,140
I'M HUNGRY.

1110
00:56:39,706 --> 00:56:41,540
[RINGING]

1111
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:51,739
Gray:
* WILL THERE BE ANY STARS,
ANY STARS IN MY CROWN *

1112
00:56:51,806 --> 00:56:53,674
[HUMMING]

1113
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:00,839
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
LATE, MR. GRAY.

1114
00:57:00,906 --> 00:57:03,407
COME ON,
UP, UP, UP.

1115
00:57:03,473 --> 00:57:05,340
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YOU GOING TO CHURCH
LIKE THAT?

1116
00:57:05,407 --> 00:57:07,773
I'M PLAYING HOOKY
TODAY, LIKE YOU.

1117
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,407
MR. GRAY...

1118
00:57:10,473 --> 00:57:12,340
PLENTY OF TIME,
HARRIET,
PLENTY OF TIME.

1119
00:57:12,407 --> 00:57:15,407
OH, YOU ALWAYS
SAY THAT. HERE.

1120
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,340
I DECLARE, MR. GRAY,
I COULD GET
YOUR WHOLE...

1121
00:57:17,407 --> 00:57:19,273
CONGREGATION READY
FOR CHURCH...

1122
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,340
BEFORE I COULD YOU.

1123
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,340
WELL, HARRIET,
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT

1124
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:24,773
THE RESULT'S
WORTH THE BOTHER.

1125
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:25,839
HMM.

1126
00:57:25,906 --> 00:57:27,906
YOU DON'T SOUND
LIKE YOU MEAN IT.

1127
00:57:27,973 --> 00:57:29,839
MAYBE YOU'RE STILL
LOOKING FOR THAT
STRAIGHT STICK.

1128
00:57:29,906 --> 00:57:31,340
THAT'S SUCH
AN OLD JOKE.

1129
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:33,073
GONNA MISS YOUR
SWEET VOICE TODAY.

1130
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,473
SOMETIMES YOU
SOUND JUST LIKE
A RIBBON DRUMMER.

1131
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,773
NOW, GO.

1132
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:36,973
JOHN, YOU MIND
YOU KEEP
YOUR WINDOW OPEN,

1133
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,273
YOU CAN HEAR
THE SINGING.

1134
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,340
<i>ARE YOU GONNA SING
STARS IN MY CROWN?</i>

1135
00:57:40,407 --> 00:57:42,173
I THINK THAT MIGHT
BE ARRANGED.

1136
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,373
OH, DON'T YOU CUT YOUR EYES
AT ME, YOU TWO.

1137
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,973
I KNOW JUST WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,

1138
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,440
AND IT WON'T DO YOU
A PARTICLE OF GOOD.

1139
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:51,307
GUSSIE LOU LYLES IS
GOING TO OBLIGE YOU
AT THE ORGAN, MR. GRAY,

1140
00:57:51,373 --> 00:57:52,806
AND THE HYMNS ARE
ALL PICKED OUT.

1141
00:57:52,873 --> 00:57:54,473
WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT THEY ARE?

1142
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,207
YOU SEE, JOHN?

1143
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:58,173
YOU CAN'T GET
AHEAD OF YOUR
AUNT HARRIET.

1144
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,307
STRAIGHT STICK,
INDEED.

1145
00:58:02,373 --> 00:58:03,973
STRAIGHT STICK
WHAT?

1146
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,739
OH, IT'S JUST
AN OLD STORY.

1147
00:58:05,806 --> 00:58:06,940
I NEVER HEARD IT.

1148
00:58:07,006 --> 00:58:08,340
IT'S ABOUT
THE YOUNG MAN

1149
00:58:08,407 --> 00:58:11,173
WHO USED TO COME
CALL ON ME.

1150
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,906
TELL ME THE STORY,
AUNT HARRIET.

1151
00:58:12,973 --> 00:58:15,674
WELL, YOU SEE,
BEFORE I MET
THE PARSON,

1152
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:16,906
I WAS NEVER
SATISFIED

1153
00:58:16,973 --> 00:58:18,839
WITH ANY
OF THE SUITORS
WHO CAME CALLING.

1154
00:58:18,906 --> 00:58:20,340
I USED TO LAUGH
AT THEM

1155
00:58:20,407 --> 00:58:22,340
AND MAKE JOKES ABOUT
THE WAY THEY ACTED.

1156
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:24,340
FINALLY, MY MOTHER
SAID TO ME,

1157
00:58:24,407 --> 00:58:26,340
"HARRIET,
I ONCE KNEW A MAN

1158
00:58:26,407 --> 00:58:27,839
"WHO WENT WALKING
IN THE WOODS

1159
00:58:27,906 --> 00:58:29,839
"LOOKING FOR A GOOD,
STRAIGHT STICK

1160
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,839
"TO MAKE INTO
A WALKING CANE.

1161
00:58:31,906 --> 00:58:33,839
"HE HADN'T GONE FAR
BEFORE HE FOUND

1162
00:58:33,906 --> 00:58:36,173
"WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS
THE PROPER OAK LIMB.

1163
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,340
"BUT AS HE WENT
TO CUT IT,

1164
00:58:37,407 --> 00:58:38,340
"HE NOTICED
IT WASN'T QUITE

1165
00:58:38,407 --> 00:58:40,240
"STRAIGHT ENOUGH
TO SUIT HIM.

1166
00:58:40,307 --> 00:58:42,940
<i>"I'LL JUST LOOK
A LITTLE LONGER,
SAID THE MAN.</i>

1167
00:58:43,006 --> 00:58:45,473
"AND IT WAS THE SAME
WITH EVERY TREE
IN THAT WOOD.

1168
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,440
"THE FIRST THING
HE KNEW,
IT WAS DARK,

1169
00:58:47,507 --> 00:58:49,440
"AND HE'D SPENT
THE WHOLE DAY
IN THAT WOOD,

1170
00:58:49,507 --> 00:58:52,240
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO SHOW
FOR HIS TROUBLE."

1171
00:58:52,307 --> 00:58:53,540
MAMA SAID,

1172
00:58:53,607 --> 00:58:56,806
"HARRIET, THAT'S
THE WAY YOU ARE
ABOUT MEN."

1173
00:58:56,873 --> 00:58:59,473
"WHY," SHE SAID,
"EVERY MAN BORN

1174
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,706
"HAS SOMETHING
THE MATTER WITH HIM.

1175
00:59:01,773 --> 00:59:03,307
"AND IF YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR
THE PERFECT MAN,

1176
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,806
YOU'LL NEVER
FIND HIM."

1177
00:59:05,873 --> 00:59:08,806
BUT THE MINUTE
I SAW THE PARSON,

1178
00:59:08,873 --> 00:59:10,507
I KNEW MAMA
WAS WRONG.

1179
00:59:14,173 --> 00:59:15,273
AUNT HARRIET?

1180
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,106
YES, DEAR?

1181
00:59:17,173 --> 00:59:18,407
YOU KNOW,

1182
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:20,906
I'M GLAD
I LIVE WITH YOU
AND THE PARSON

1183
00:59:20,973 --> 00:59:24,706
INSTEAD OF
WITH A MA AND PA
LIKE OTHER BOYS.

1184
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,307
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID?

1185
00:59:29,373 --> 00:59:33,806
* WILL THERE BE ANY STARS,
ANY STARS IN MY CROWN *

1186
00:59:33,873 --> 00:59:38,473
* WHEN AT EVENING
THE SUN GOETH DOWN *

1187
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:44,640
* WHEN I WAKE WITH THE BLESSED
IN THE MANSIONS OF REST *

1188
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:50,440
* WILL THERE BE
ANY STARS IN MY CROWN? *

I WAS STILL IN BED
WHEN SCHOOL OPENED,

1190
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,373
BUT THE PARSON
WENT DOWN AS USUAL

1191
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,873
TO START THE TERM OFF
IN STYLE.

1192
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:00,373
NOW, THERE'S ONE THING MORE
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU.

1193
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,373
HOW MANY OF YOU SAY
YOUR PRAYERS REGULAR?

1194
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,373
FINE, FINE.
THAT'S FIRST-RATE.

1195
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,373
JUST SO YOU DON'T GET
TO LEANING SO HARD ON GOD'S HELP

1196
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,873
THAT YOU FORGET
HOW TO HELP YOURSELVES.

1197
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,873
PUTS ME IN MIND
OF A TIME--

1198
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:17,373
I THINK IT WAS IN THE BATTLE
OF CHATTANOOGA IN '63--

1199
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,873
MY HORSE FELL
WITH ME, SEE,

1200
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,240
AND I HAD TO MAKE
A DIVE FOR COVER.

1201
01:00:21,307 --> 01:00:22,473
WELL, I LIT
RIGHT ALONGSIDE

1202
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,973
THIS OLD
TOBACCO-CHEWING
LANCE CORPORAL.

1203
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,640
HE LOOKED AT ME
LAYING THERE
ON THE GROUND,

1204
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,906
AND HE LOOKED AT
THE BIBLE STICKING
OUT OF MY POCKET.

1205
01:00:29,973 --> 01:00:32,906
HE SAYS TO ME,
"SON,

1206
01:00:32,973 --> 01:00:35,540
"JUST 'CAUSE
YOU'RE A PRAYIN' MAN

1207
01:00:35,607 --> 01:00:37,340
DON'T MEAN YOU
DON'T HAVE TO KEEP
YOUR HIND END DOWN."

[GIGGLING]

1209
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,473
WELL, I KNOW
IT'S BEEN
A LONG SUMMER,

1210
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:42,839
AND YOU'RE ALL
ANXIOUS TO GET
BACK TO YOUR BOOKS.

1211
01:00:42,906 --> 01:00:45,407
[GROANS]

1212
01:00:45,473 --> 01:00:46,906
Faith: I THINK
THOSE BOOKS WILL KEEP

1213
01:00:46,973 --> 01:00:48,674
FOR ONE MORE DAY,
DON'T YOU, CHILDREN?

1214
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:50,340

[CHEERING]

1216
01:00:56,507 --> 01:00:59,373
MR. GRAY,
I'D LIKE A WORD
WITH YOU.

1217
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,873
MAY I ASK WHAT
YOU'RE DOING HERE?

1218
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,373
MAY I ASK
WHY YOU'RE ASKING?

1219
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,873
USE YOUR HEAD,
MAN.

1220
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,440
THERE'S TYPHOID FEVER
IN YOUR HOUSE.

1221
01:01:06,507 --> 01:01:07,873
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO SPREAD IT
ALL OVER TOWN,

1222
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,373
YOU'D BETTER GO HOME
AND STAY THERE.

1223
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,373
NOW,
WAIT A MINUTE.

1224
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,940
LAST I HEARD,
SLOW FEVER CAME

1225
01:01:12,006 --> 01:01:14,373
FROM BAD DRINKING
WATER, NOT FROM
BAD PREACHING--

1226
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,873
OR EVEN
FROM GOOD PREACHING.

1227
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,706
KINDLY ALLOW ME
TO KNOW MY BUSINESS.

1228
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:18,806
DID YOU VISIT JOHN
THIS MORNING?

1229
01:01:18,873 --> 01:01:19,873
YES.

1230
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,873
YOU STOOD AROUND
TALKING TO HIM?

1231
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,073
SAT ON HIS BED--
TOUCHED HIM?

1232
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,873
YES, I SUPPOSE
I DID.

1233
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:25,373
WELL, THAT MAKES YOU
A POTENTIAL CARRIER.

1234
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,940
DON'T YOU
REALIZE THAT?

1235
01:01:27,006 --> 01:01:28,640
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THAT BY COMING
DOWN HERE TODAY,

1236
01:01:28,706 --> 01:01:30,073
YOU MIGHT HAVE
EXPOSED THESE
CHILDREN

1237
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,407
AND MISS SAMUELS
TO INFECTION?

1238
01:01:31,473 --> 01:01:32,906
YOU CAN STOP
RIGHT THERE.

1239
01:01:32,973 --> 01:01:34,839
SURE, I'VE BEEN
GOING IN AND OUT
OF JOHN'S ROOM.

1240
01:01:34,906 --> 01:01:36,407
SO HAVE YOU.

1241
01:01:36,473 --> 01:01:37,906
I'VE BEEN GOING
ABOUT MY BUSINESS,

1242
01:01:37,973 --> 01:01:39,839
PAYING CALLS
AND MAKING SPEECHES.

1243
01:01:39,906 --> 01:01:41,407
SO HAVE YOU.

1244
01:01:41,473 --> 01:01:42,407
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
IN WHAT YOU SAY,

1245
01:01:42,473 --> 01:01:44,240
I RECKON THEY OUGHT TO
LOCK US BOTH UP.

1246
01:01:44,307 --> 01:01:45,973
HOW LONG DO YOU
SUPPOSE THIS TOWN
COULD MANAGE

1247
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,440
WITHOUT ME
OR SOMEBODY LIKE ME
WHO'D DO MY WORK?

1248
01:01:48,507 --> 01:01:50,240
WHO'D DO MINE?

SCHOOL HAD HARDLY OPENED
WHEN IT HAD TO CLOSE AGAIN.

1250
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:04,440
FAITH SAMUELS
WAS DOWN WITH SLOW FEVER.

1251
01:02:04,507 --> 01:02:06,940
AND IN NO TIME,
LIGHTS WERE BURNING
TILL DAYLIGHT

1252
01:02:07,006 --> 01:02:10,574
ALL OVER TOWN
AS THE SICKNESS SPREAD
AND KEPT ON SPREADING.

1253
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,373
YOU'RE LATE,
MR. GRAY.

1254
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,373

THE ISBELL PLACE.

1255

CHASE HAS GOT
SLOW FEVER.

1256
01:02:29,873 --> 01:02:31,373
CHASE TOO?

1257
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,906
DON'T SAY
ANYTHING TO JOHN.

1258
01:02:33,973 --> 01:02:36,674
I NEVER SAW JED
IN SUCH A STATE.

1259
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:38,407
HE'S SCARED.

1260
01:02:38,473 --> 01:02:39,407
WANTING TO YELL
FOR HELP,

1261
01:02:39,473 --> 01:02:42,407
NOT KNOWING
WHO TO YELL TO.

1262
01:02:42,473 --> 01:02:44,307
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I'M SCARED MYSELF.

1263
01:02:44,373 --> 01:02:46,407
COME AND EAT.

1264
01:02:46,473 --> 01:02:49,140

AND TOMORROW,
SOMEONE ELSE--

UNLESS WE FIND
THE SOURCE.

1271
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:02,440
WE'VE GOT
TO FIND IT.

1272
01:03:02,507 --> 01:03:06,407
WHEN MR. BACKETT CAME BY
WITH MY PROVISIONS,

1273
01:03:06,473 --> 01:03:08,540
HE SAID HE THOUGHT
IT MIGHTY STRANGE
THAT YOU HADN'T

1274
01:03:08,607 --> 01:03:10,440
THOUGHT TO EXAMINE
THE SCHOOL WELL.

1275
01:03:10,507 --> 01:03:12,940
IF LON BACKETT HAD
HALF THE BRAINS
HE WAS BORN WITH,

1276
01:03:13,006 --> 01:03:14,839
HE'D KNOW
IT COULDN'T BE
THE SCHOOL WELL.

1277
01:03:14,906 --> 01:03:16,773
JOHN CAME DOWN WITH
THE FEVER FIRST.

1278
01:03:16,839 --> 01:03:18,307
THAT WAS
BEFORE SCHOOL
EVEN STARTED.

1279
01:03:18,373 --> 01:03:20,373
THAT'S SO.

1280
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,806
THIS CHICKEN PIE
IS GOOD.

1281
01:03:22,873 --> 01:03:25,806

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

1283
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:32,806
WHY, MR. CARROLL.

01:03:41,407 --> 01:03:42,607
OF COURSE I WILL.

HOW DOES HE MEAN,
YOUR FAULT?

1304
01:05:12,739 --> 01:05:14,906
HE MEANS I PICKED UP
THE FEVER FROM JOHN

1305
01:05:14,973 --> 01:05:17,173
AND PASSED IT ON
TO THE OTHER KIDS
SOMEHOW.

IT ISN'T TRUE?

HE'S A DOCTOR,

HIS BUSINESS.

I GUESS I SHOULD
HAVE LISTENED
TO HIM THAT DAY,

1313

BUT HE RILED ME,
KIND OF.

1314
01:05:30,607 --> 01:05:32,973
NOW I KEEP THINKING
MAYBE HE WAS RIGHT.

1315
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,373
MAYBE HE'S
BEEN RIGHT
ALL THE TIME,

1316
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,440
ONLY NOW
IT'S TOO LATE--

1317
01:05:37,507 --> 01:05:41,440
TOO LATE
FOR BOBBY SAM,
ANYWAY.

WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO?

NOW'S THE TIME
WHEN PEOPLE
NEED YOU MOST.

YOU KNOW WHAT
DAN HARRIS TOLD ME,

1324
01:05:52,973 --> 01:05:54,273
RIGHT OFF?

1325
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:57,173
"GO HOME
AND STAY THERE."

1326
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,906
I WASN'T MAN
ENOUGH TO DO IT.

1327
01:05:59,973 --> 01:06:03,273
I CAN'T SAY WHETHER
I'M MAN ENOUGH
TO DO IT NOW, BUT--

1328
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:04,373
I AIM TO FIND OUT.

1329
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,273
TOMORROW, THOUGH.

1330
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:08,340
THE SERVICES?

1331
01:06:08,407 --> 01:06:10,540
THERE AREN'T GONNA
BE ANY SERVICES.

WHEN THE PARSON CLOSED
THE DOOR TO THE CHURCH,

1337
01:06:33,006 --> 01:06:36,906
HE ALSO CLOSED
THE DOOR ON HIMSELF.

1338
01:06:36,973 --> 01:06:38,373
IT WAS ALL
HE COULD DO NOW

1339
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,873
FOR THE FOLKS
WHO TRUSTED HIM.

1340
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:43,373
THE REST WAS UP TO
YOUNG DOC HARRIS.

1341
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,806
SO, IN A WAY, YOU SEE,
THIS UNHAPPY TIME WAS

1342
01:06:45,873 --> 01:06:48,940
YOUNG DOC'S REAL HOMECOMING.

1343
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:53,373
NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME,
HE KNEW HOW GOOD IT WAS
TO BE NEEDED;

1344
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,173
GOOD TO BE WATCHED FOR
AND WELCOMED LIKE
A TRUSTED FRIEND.

1345
01:06:59,873 --> 01:07:02,839
IT WAS EVEN GOOD TO GO
RED-EYED AND DOG-TIRED,

1346
01:07:02,906 --> 01:07:04,839
SNATCHING SLEEP

01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:03,407
"YOU'VE GOT
24 HOURS TO CLEAR
OFF THIS LAND.

1512
01:17:03,473 --> 01:17:06,173
"GET OFF,
OR GET A ROPE
AROUND YOUR NECK.

1514
01:17:08,674 --> 01:17:10,207
LET ME SEE.

1515
01:17:11,839 --> 01:17:14,173
CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT.

1516
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,340
JUST CAN'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

1517
01:17:16,407 --> 01:17:17,906
WHY, THERE AIN'T
A MAN FOR MILES AROUND

1518
01:17:17,973 --> 01:17:21,340
THAT I AIN'T KNOWED
AS WELL AS I KNOW
THIS BOY HERE.

1519
01:17:21,407 --> 01:17:23,173
YOU STILL DON'T
WANT TO SELL?

1520
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,674
I DON'T SEE HOW
I CAN DO THAT, PARSON.

1521
01:17:25,739 --> 01:17:29,340
THAT'S MY PROPERTY.
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.

1522
01:17:29,407 --> 01:17:32,706
IF I'VE GOT TO DIE,
I'LL DO IT ON MY PROPERTY.

1523
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:45,940
MR. BACKETT?
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU

1524
01:17:46,006 --> 01:17:48,940
THIS PERSECUTION
OF UNCLE FAMOUS
HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH.

1525
01:17:49,006 --> 01:17:50,440
YOU CALL--
NOW HOLD ON,
PARSON.

1526
01:17:50,507 --> 01:17:51,806
I'M
A CHURCHGOING MAN,
AND YOU KNOW IT,

1527
01:17:51,873 --> 01:17:52,806
BUT THAT DON'T
GIVE YOU THE RIGHT

1528
01:17:52,873 --> 01:17:53,806
TO COME BUSTIN'
INTO MY STORE

1529
01:17:53,873 --> 01:17:54,739
AND INTERFERIN'
IN MY BUSINESS.

1530
01:17:54,806 --> 01:17:55,806
RIGHT NOW, MR. BACKETT,

1531
01:17:55,873 --> 01:17:58,373
YOUR BUSINESS IS
INTERFERING WITH MINE.

1532
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,806
I'M ASKING YOU,
BEFORE GOD--
DON'T YOU REALIZE

1533
01:17:59,873 --> 01:18:01,806
WHAT YOU'RE SETTING
OUT TO DO HERE?

1534
01:18:01,873 --> 01:18:04,207
MURDER ONE OLD MAN,
STEAL HIS PROPERTY,

1535
01:18:04,273 --> 01:18:06,806
TAKE YOUR CUT,
AND THEN CALL
THE JOB DONE?

1536
01:18:06,873 --> 01:18:08,873
IT WON'T END THERE.
DON'T THINK IT.

1537
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,340
YOU--ALL OF YOU.

1538
01:18:13,407 --> 01:18:14,839
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
IN THE LAST WEEKS?

1539
01:18:14,906 --> 01:18:16,340
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN
THE SLOW FEVER AT WORK?

1540
01:18:16,407 --> 01:18:18,340
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN
ONE POISONED WELL

1541
01:18:18,407 --> 01:18:20,340
SPREAD GRIEF AND TROUBLE
THROUGH HALF THE TOWN?

1542
01:18:20,407 --> 01:18:22,340
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THE POISON IN THAT WELL

1543
01:18:22,407 --> 01:18:24,307
WAS CATLAP
COMPARED TO THIS?

1544
01:18:24,373 --> 01:18:26,006
IF THAT POISON'S
ALLOWED TO START,

1545
01:18:26,073 --> 01:18:27,839
IT'LL SPREAD
UNTIL THERE ISN'T A WHOLE SOUL

1546
01:18:27,906 --> 01:18:29,273
OR A HEALTHY CONSCIENCE
LEFT IN WALESBURG.

1547
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:30,940
WELL, I AIM TO SEE--

1548
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,273
YOU WAIT AND SEE.

1549
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,906
THERE'LL BE
NO ROPE AROUND
ANYBODY'S NECK

1550
01:18:33,973 --> 01:18:36,607
AS LONG AS THERE'S
ONE MAN OF US
LEFT TO STOP IT.

1551
01:18:36,674 --> 01:18:38,240
NIGHTRIDERS.

1552
01:18:38,307 --> 01:18:40,340

AND CALLED YOU MEN.

1555
01:18:44,006 --> 01:18:47,207
AND IF I WASN'T HIS SERVANT,
I'D TAKE A BUGGY WHIP
TO THE LOT OF YOU.

1556
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,307
WE GONNA TAKE THAT
FROM HIM?

1557
01:18:55,373 --> 01:18:56,307
WE DON'T WANT
NO PREACHER--

1558
01:18:56,373 --> 01:18:57,473
SHUT HIS MOUTH
FOR HIM.

1559
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,806
IF HE WANTS A FIGHT,
LET'S GIVE IT TO HIM.

1560
01:18:59,873 --> 01:19:02,173
KIND OF LOOKING
FORWARD TO TONIGHT.

1561
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:20,674
ROLFE HERE TELLS ME
YOU RUN INTO TROUBLE
WITH LON BACKETT'S CROWD.

1562
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:21,906
THAT'S ONE WAY
OF PUTTING IT.

1563
01:19:21,973 --> 01:19:23,739
WELL, IS THERE
ENOUGH TROUBLE
FOR 6 OF US?

1564
01:19:23,806 --> 01:19:25,839
OH, JED,
YOU NEVER CHANGE,
DO YOU?

1565
01:19:25,906 --> 01:19:27,839
HA HA!
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

1566
01:19:27,906 --> 01:19:29,006
WELL, I BRUNG YOU
A HORSE,

1567
01:19:29,073 --> 01:19:30,906
SO GET YOUR PISTOLS,
AND LET'S GO.

1568
01:19:30,973 --> 01:19:32,906
I'M NOT TAKING
MY PISTOLS
WITH ME THIS TIME.

1569
01:19:32,973 --> 01:19:35,040
AFRAID I MIGHT
FORGET MYSELF
AND USE 'EM.

1570
01:19:35,106 --> 01:19:36,906
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT THEY'RE
FOR, AIN'T THEY?

1571
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:39,906
MAYBE,
BUT IT'S NOT
WHAT I'M FOR.

1572
01:19:39,973 --> 01:19:41,407
LORD KNOWS,
I WANT YOU
BOYS ALONG--

1573
01:19:41,473 --> 01:19:43,240
WANT YOU BAD.
BUT IF YOU
WANT TO COME,

1574
01:19:43,307 --> 01:19:45,407
YOU'LL HAVE TO COME
LIKE I TELL YOU,
AND ON MY TERMS.

1575
01:19:45,473 --> 01:19:47,340
SO I'LL JUST
TAKE CHARGE
OF THOSE GUNS.

1576
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:48,940
OH, NOW,
LOOKIT HERE.

1577
01:19:49,006 --> 01:19:51,207
YOU AIN'T GOT A FRIEND
IN THAT CROWD
SINCE THIS MORNING.

1578
01:19:51,273 --> 01:19:52,873
AND IF YOU'RE AIMIN' ON
SPOILING THEIR PARTY,

1579
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,540
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
SOME CARE TAKEN OF YOU.

1580
01:19:54,607 --> 01:19:56,940
I FIGURE I'LL BE
TAKEN CARE OF,
ALL RIGHT.

1581
01:19:57,006 --> 01:19:59,273
OH, J.D. GRAY,
I DON'T KNOW YOU
NO MORE.

1582
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,973
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
SHUCK OFF
THAT LONG TAIL COAT

1583
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,873
AND BE A MAN AGAIN?

1584
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,806
WHEN YOU COMIN'
TO CHURCH, JED?

1585
01:20:04,873 --> 01:20:06,207
OH--COME ON, BOYS.

1586
01:20:19,373 --> 01:20:20,706

HOW I FELT THAT NIGHT

1588
01:20:32,473 --> 01:20:36,973
AS I WATCHED THE PARSON
SET OUT, LEAVING ME BEHIND.

1589
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,240
BUT I KNEW THE WAY
TO UNCLE FAMOUS'
AS WELL AS HE DID.

1590
01:20:40,307 --> 01:20:42,407
AND IF HIS TOWN
HAD FAILED HIM,

1591
01:20:42,473 --> 01:20:44,273
THAT WAS NO REASON
FOR ME TO DO THE SAME.

1592
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:08,373
COME ON OUT, FAMOUS,
OR WE'LL COME IN
AND GET YOU!

1593
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,207

YOUR TIME, PARSON.

STAND ASIDE.

1596
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,073
STAND ASIDE,

GO ANY FURTHER,

01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,739
THERE'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE
TO TAKE UP WITH YOU.

1602
01:21:38,806 --> 01:21:40,739
MIND YOU, I'M NOT
OUT HERE TO TRY

1603
01:21:40,806 --> 01:21:42,407
AND TALK YOU OUT
OF ANYTHING.

1604
01:21:42,473 --> 01:21:44,906
IF YOU'RE STILL DETERMINED
TO DO THIS THING,

1605
01:21:44,973 --> 01:21:46,839
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY WAY
I CAN STOP YOU.

1606
01:21:46,906 --> 01:21:48,507

01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:55,407
DON'T LET THEM!
LET GO OF ME!

BELONG HERE,

YOU DIDN'T
LET ME FINISH.

1614
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,373
I CAME OUT HERE
TONIGHT

1615
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,040
BECAUSE UNCLE FAMOUS
ASKED ME TO COME.

1616
01:22:13,106 --> 01:22:15,373
HE KNOWS
HE'S GOT TO DIE.

1617
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,873
BUT LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE,

1618
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:17,873
HE WANTED TO GET
THINGS STRAIGHT

1619
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,906
WITH GOD AND MAN
BEFORE HE GOES.

1620
01:22:19,973 --> 01:22:20,906
WE'VE PRAYED
TOGETHER,

1621
01:22:20,973 --> 01:22:23,373
AND WE'VE
TALKED TOGETHER.

1622
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,373
UNCLE FAMOUS HAS
EVEN MADE A WILL.
