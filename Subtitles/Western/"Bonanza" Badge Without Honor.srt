00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,472
ANNOUNCER:
<i>The following program</i>

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:09,042
<i>is brought to you</i>
<i>in living color on NBC.</i>

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,773
(fanfare plays)

4
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,283
(hoofbeats approaching)

5
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,192
(horse whinnying)

6
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,268
We got the wrong man, Bob.
That's Adam Cartwright.

7
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,032
Come on, let's get out of here.

8
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,667
(gunshot)

9
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,345
(gunshot)

10
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,393
Who are you?

11
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,394
MAN:
A friend.

12
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,453
(pistol cocking)

13
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,468
A friend?

14
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,403
You're sure
a feather-footed one.

15
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,604
Who are you?

16
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:14,007
Gerald Esketh, by name.

17
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:18,078
Here, perhaps this will relieve
your mind.

18
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,214
U.S. Deputy Marshall.

19
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,450
I can't say I'm sorry
to see you.

20
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,451
Who were they?

21
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,885
The Clevenger Brothers.

22
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,319
Friends of yours?

23
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,892
Hardly that, but you may have
made a terrible mistake.

24
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:37,097
Just be thankful
that you're still alive.

25
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,900
And I'll be thankful that I've
reached the end of a long trail.

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,237
The Clevengers were wanted in
California for bank robbery.

27
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:48,808
I had the, uh... unpleasant duty
of killing their older brother.

28
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,811
He was caught robbing
sluice boxes.

29
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,213
Oh, so you were the one.

30
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,650
I was only performing
my official duty.

31
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,647
(theme song playing)

32
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,000
Mr. Esketh, welcome
to the Ponderosa.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,602
From what Adam tells me,
we're greatly in your debt.

34
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,337
Well, I'm happy that I was
fortunate enough

35
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,206
to be in the right place
at the right time.

36
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,408
Well, we'll try to make your
stay here

37
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,409
a very comfortable one.

38
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,944
- Please.
- Thank you.

39
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,080
I appreciate a great deal what
you did for Adam, Mr. Esketh.

40
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,140
For all of us.

41
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,760
Adam, anything else
you want to tell me?

42
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,896
Well, I still can't
believe it, Pa.

43
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,232
I mean, I'm not selling
the Clevengers short--

44
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,900
roughest bunch
of renegades I've ever known--

45
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,469
but I just can't imagine
them taking a shot at me.

46
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,004
You never know with that bunch.

47
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,207
Old Gid Clevenger and his boys
have made their own laws

48
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,809
for so long, you never know when
they might step over the line.

49
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,744
And you did have the ranch
payroll with you.

50
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,647
They must have thought
I was somebody else.

51
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,482
Believe me, Adam, I know
how you feel,

52
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,618
but the marshal did have
a warrant for them.

53
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,286
Well, there's one thing for
certain,

54
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,621
he isn't too upset about it.

55
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,324
Now, come on, we've got a guest
to take care of.

56
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,992
We'll decide later what
to tell Gid Clevenger.

57
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,861
If he gives us a chance to talk.

58
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:49,851
BEN (mutters):
Yeah.

59
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,466
The bucolic life
is not for Gerald Esketh.

60
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,835
Pa, I put Mr. Esketh's bag
in the upstairs room.

61
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,337
Thanks, son.

62
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,406
Well, one would scarcely expect
to encounter the épée

63
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,175
out here in the wilderness.

64
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,377
Well, Little Joe's mother
was Louisiana French.

65
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,046
He likes to play around
with them.

66
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:10,216
You mean, you actually use this?

67
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,884
Well, I fool around
with it just for fun.

68
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,254
He's faster than greased
lightning, Mr. Esketh.

69
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,779
Come on, Joe, let's show him.

70
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,895
En garde, brother.

71
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,660
You should never have given
those two a chance to show off.

72
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,503
Oh!

73
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,904
Dadgum...

74
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,270
(laughing)

75
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,008
You know, they really have no
intention of killing each other.

76
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,682
He has an admirable skill.

77
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,245
(grunts)

78
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,456
Whack him over the head, Hoss.

79
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,058
You'll never get anywhere
poking at him.

80
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,359
(yelling)

81
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,061
(laughing)

82
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,596
Touché.

83
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,365
Nevertheless, your technique
is not quite flawless.

84
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,925
When you feint to the left,
you're a bit off balance.

85
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,311
En garde.

86
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,047
En garde.

87
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,136
You know, you could hurt
somebody with that.

88
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,934
Lost the button off the point.

89
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,608
So I did.

90
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,370
This might have been fatal.

91
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,186
Violence as such is vulgar.

92
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,423
Any man, who in anger,
takes a human life,

93
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,059
becomes a brother of the apes.

94
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,595
He's an aesthetically
impoverished man.

95
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,829
Don't you think so?

96
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,865
Oh, yes, sir.

97
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,500
I reckon.

98
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,069
And yet, the skills and rhythms

99
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,372
of disciplined violence
have beauty,

100
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,976
like a painting by Rubens
or Botticelli.

101
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,712
Unfettered by personal emotion.

102
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,213
Yes.

103
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,115
There, to that simple word,

104
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,785
can be traced the downfall
of most artists

105
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,688
and many human creatures--
emotion.

106
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,023
Yeah, that's a... that's

107
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,359
a very interesting observation,
Mr. Esketh.

108
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,528
I don't think I could cast you
in the mold

109
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,329
of an average lawman.

110
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,432
I've been told that.

111
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,570
Well, I think the elegance and
hospitality of your home

112
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,740
have made me forget
my original mission.

113
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,109
I'm here to visit an old friend.

114
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,511
Would you happen to know
a Mr. Jason Blane?

115
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,213
- Oh, the assayer?
- Yes.

116
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,981
Oh yes, know him--
know him very well.

117
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,116
And his wife.

118
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,417
Wife?

119
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,585
Jason married?

120
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,320
Oh, yes, about a year.

121
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,155
They were married
right in this very room.

122
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,057
Then you do know him well.

123
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,793
Well, Jason has always been
a little hard to know,

124
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,396
but, uh, Mariette is practically
a part of our family.

125
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,899
Mariette. What a charming name.

126
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:52,271
Yes, uh, her father was
a very dear friend of mine.

127
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,173
When he died, he left
the raising of Mariette

128
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,641
almost entirely
to my supervision.

129
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,346
Jason Blane married.

130
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,949
How very, very interesting.

131
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,217
Is she a pretty girl?

132
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,152
Oh, we always thought so.

133
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,187
But of course, we could be
slightly prejudiced.

134
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,189
Oh, no, my dear Adam,
I have a feeling

135
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,191
I can trust your judgment
in such matters.

136
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,359
Time to eat, please.

137
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,360
Oh, good.

138
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,329
Could I, uh, freshen up
a bit before supper?

139
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,264
Why, of course.
I'll show you to your room.

140
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,941
Adam, what're you staring at?

141
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,610
Oh, I didn't realize I was.

142
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,678
(door closes)

143
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,681
Look, I know you feel bad
about the Clevengers.

144
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,351
But it's like
Esketh told Hoss and me.

145
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,887
Bob and Bill had a bead
right on your back.

146
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,322
He had to shoot fast and any way
he could.

147
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,359
You ought to just be thankful
he was there.

148
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,129
Yeah, I'll try to remember that.

149
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,597
Come on, let's have some supper.

150
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,589
Right.

151
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,506
And so, under the circumstances,
there was little I could do.

152
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:04,076
And that, gentlemen, is the way
I shot my first tiger in India.

153
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,078
Oh! (gasps)

154
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,947
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
Number One Cousin,

155
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,115
can't you do anything right?

156
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,917
Here, let me do that.
Sorry, Gerald.

157
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,986
Mr. Cartwright, take you long
time to know San Francisco.

158
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,022
Take me long time
to know Ponderosa.

159
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,158
I help you in San Francisco,
you help me in Ponderosa.

160
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,826
All right?

161
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,886
All right, thank you.

162
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,033
(chuckling)

163
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,936
You know, for years we had the
most wonderful cook, Hop Sing.

164
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,437
He went back to Hong Kong,

165
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,439
and talked me into hiring
his Number One Cousin.

166
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,640
I don't know.

167
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,442
Number One Cousin?
Doesn't he have a name?

168
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,412
If he's got one,
he hasn't told us about it.

169
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,746
I'm sorry about this, Gerald.

170
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,881
Think nothing of it.

171
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,683
The same thing happened
when I was dining

172
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,251
with the Prince of Wales
in Paris.

173
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,652
Dadgum, Mr. Esketh,

174
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,321
if you ain't been just
about every place.

175
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,223
And there's one place I never
cease to enjoy going to.

176
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,558
- Where's that?
- Bed.

177
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,559
(chuckling)

178
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,560
I've had a long ride

179
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,796
and I'm afraid
I'm not much of a night owl.

180
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,097
Gerald, this has been

181
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,865
an extremely pleasant evening--
extremely pleasant.

182
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,134
I'm sorry about what happened
at the end of it.

183
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,770
Oh, Hoss and Joe, see that Mr.
Esketh has everything he needs.

184
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,771
Yes, sir.

185
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,107
And tomorrow morning, Adam and
I will ride into Virginia City

186
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,276
with you, we'll show you where
Jason and Mariette live.

187
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,277
Fine. Fine.

188
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,212
Have a good rest.

189
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,815
Adam, I regret the circumstances
under which we met,

190
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,751
but I'm grateful
that we-we did meet.

191
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,220
A stranger in
a strange community.

192
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,557
It's heartening to have
substantial friends.

193
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,719
- Good night.
- Good night.

194
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,664
HOSS:
Mr. Esketh, did you sure enough

195
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,432
have that old tiger cat
by the tail?

196
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,734
ESKETH:
Sure enough.

197
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,671
That Hoss makes the most
wonderful audience, doesn't he?

198
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,312
I hope you'll go along
with my little whimsy

199
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,880
in wanting to surprise Jason.

200
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,348
We were such close friends,

201
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,651
and it's been such a long time
since I've seen him.

202
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,786
Are you sure you can
find the house?

203
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,554
My dear Adam, your directions
are most explicit.

204
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,289
Now, don't forget,
we want you to spend

205
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,492
at least a few days with us
at the ranch house.

206
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,693
I know Adam and the boys

207
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,395
will want to take you
on that cougar hunt.

208
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:06,699
Ben, I can't tell you how much
I appreciate your hospitality.

209
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,200
And, as I told you before,

210
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,070
there's nothing in life I find
as exciting as a hunt.

211
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,767
Thank you, again, both of you.

212
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,109
Adam, when you get
through at the bank,

213
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,378
meet me at the hotel,
we'll have a bite to eat.

214
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,471
- Right.
- C'mon.

215
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,411
Pardon me, dear lady,
if I startled you.

216
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,680
But I had wrongly assumed
that no one was home

217
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,881
and had started to leave.

218
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,817
I'm glad that I was in error.

219
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,086
You're Mrs. Blane?

220
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,287
Yes, I am.

221
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,422
The Cartwrights told me
all about you.

222
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,191
Are you a friend
of the Cartwrights?

223
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,494
And an old and dear friend
of your good husband.

224
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,529
Gerald Esketh is my name.

225
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,896
Surely, Jason has mentioned me.

226
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,902
No, I don't recall.

227
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,139
Well, that is, I've never met
any of Jason's friends.

228
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,041
Did you meet him in California?

229
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,976
I did, indeed.

230
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,547
My dear child,

231
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:32,685
Jason's mineralogy
has surely been worthwhile.

232
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,554
He's found a true jewel.

233
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,357
I don't know if you're
making fun of me or not,

234
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,860
but Jason is not at home.

235
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,996
Then perhaps you wouldn't mind
if I waited a while for him.

236
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,899
Ben and Adam have some business
to transact in town,

237
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,501
and I'm a total stranger here.

238
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,769
Oh, yes, of course.

239
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,936
How rude of me.

240
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,738
Won't you come in, Mr. Esketh?

241
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,764
Thank you.

242
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,883
Oh, won't you sit down,
Mr. Esketh?

243
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,909
Thank you.

244
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,455
I'll make you some tea.

245
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,223
How very thoughtful of you.

246
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,959
What a fine likeness of Jason.

247
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,450
Yes, it is, isn't it?

248
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,233
- Hey.
- Jason, good morning.

249
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,335
- How are you, Adam?
- Fine. Did your friend find you?

250
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,537
Oh, who's that?

251
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,840
Your friend from California--
Gerald Esketh.

252
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,542
No.

253
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,010
Is there anything wrong?

254
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,446
Uh... no.

255
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,748
Uh, everything's all ri...

256
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,584
Esketh-- uh, is he here in town?

257
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,386
Well, he stopped over
at our ranch last night,

258
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,188
and he rode into town
this morning with us.

259
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,952
Went to your house.
He wanted to surprise you.

260
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,495
Thank-thank you, Adam.

261
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,770
You have some very
interesting things, Mariette.

262
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,105
I couldn't help
but notice this jewel box.

263
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,875
Oh, Jason took that
for assaying some ore.

264
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,211
(chuckling): I'm afraid
he isn't very practical.

265
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,545
But he is sweet.

266
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,547
We've been so happy here.

267
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,549
I'm sure you have.

268
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,987
We thought most highly of Jason
in San Francisco.

269
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,789
Oh.

270
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,891
How elegant these
must look on you.

271
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,860
Oh, but they're not real pearls.

272
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,996
But your beauty would make them
appear priceless.

273
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,433
Please, may I see them on you?

274
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,889
Oh, Jason, darling,
there you are.

275
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,257
Look who's here.

276
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,352
My dear Jason,
after all of these years.

277
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,561
Esketh.

278
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,268
They're reviving the old case
in Sacramento, Jason,

279
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,103
and they couldn't
very well proceed

280
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,006
without the chief
prosecution witness-- you.

281
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,074
Is this something
you two gentlemen

282
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,809
would rather discuss privately?

283
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,578
No, no, not at all.

284
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,014
My business
as a law enforcement officer

285
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,749
is public business,
and I'm sure that you

286
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,418
and your husband have no secrets
from each other.

287
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,944
I'll fix you some tea, Jason.

288
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,245
Have you told her
of this matter?

289
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,681
No. How could I?

290
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,016
She's almost part
of the Cartwright family.

291
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,118
How much have you told her?

292
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,820
Nothing.

293
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,517
I detest emotional display.

294
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,260
What's the matter, Jason?

295
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,001
Nothing, Mariette.

296
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,337
Nothing you'd understand.

297
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,807
You're not aware
of all the facts, Mariette.

298
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,609
He has a right
to be a reluctant witness.

299
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,545
His testimony will be against

300
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,981
the most sinister forces
in Northern California.

301
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,116
They may seek retaliation.

302
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,085
Retaliation?

303
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,688
However, he'll be
in my protective custody.

304
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,858
Jason, I trust you
to be ready for the journey,

305
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,493
shall we say, at noon tomorrow?

306
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,228
Does that allow you enough time?

307
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,896
(Jason chuckles softly)

308
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,898
You trust me?

309
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,867
I amend that.

310
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,004
I trust your wife
to see that you're ready.

311
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,139
Thank you for the tea, Mariette.

312
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,836
It was indeed a pleasure
meeting you.

313
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,659
I should never have tried
to run away from it.

314
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,038
Jason, what do you mean?

315
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,340
I loved you so much.

316
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,309
I thought I had a right
to a little happiness.

317
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,879
But you did have,
and you still have.

318
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,514
I won't let you go back.

319
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,749
We can leave,
and we can make another start.

320
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,851
Don't you see
that that's what I tried to do

321
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,553
and this is the result of it?

322
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,921
Nothing will change.

323
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,390
I've got to go back with him.

324
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,860
But he said that it
would be dangerous.

325
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,563
I don't intend
to lose you, Jason.

326
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,032
I love you much too much.

327
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,137
- Pa?
- Oh.

328
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,472
Have you seen Esketh?

329
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,773
Oh, he's probably
still with Jason.

330
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,408
Did you get that matter
straightened out at the bank?

331
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,643
- Oh, yeah.
- Good.

332
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,245
But, uh... as I was leaving,
I ran into Jason,

333
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,082
and I told him that, uh, Esketh
was looking for him,

334
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,651
and he, uh...
he seemed very upset about it.

335
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,352
Oh?

336
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,488
Think Esketh is here as a friend
to see Jason,

337
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:13,118
or, uh, is he here
in an official capacity?

338
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,196
Well, I don't know.

339
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,432
Esketh is a United States
Deputy Marshal.

340
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,835
Of course, what do we
really know about Jason?

341
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,170
Came in here,
swept Mariette off her feet.

342
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,439
Of course, he's done very well
in the year he's been here.

343
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,174
He's been very good to her.

344
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,144
I suppose that's all
you could ask of any man.

345
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,178
Yeah, well, I'd feel better

346
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,780
if I had a talk
with Mariette and Jason,

347
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,181
just ask them if there
was anything wrong.

348
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,483
What do you think?

349
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,817
I think it's a good idea.

350
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,086
And also remind Mariette
that we're still her family

351
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,921
for as long as she needs us.

352
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,948
Look, while you're over there,
I'll go see Judge Rand.

353
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,133
Going someplace, my dear Jason?

354
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,544
I was young, Esketh.

355
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,613
It was over five years ago.

356
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:11,617
Time gets away
from a man, doesn't it?

357
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,019
I'm curious, Jason.

358
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,355
Why didn't you go back to Ohio?

359
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,924
My arm isn't quite that long.

360
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,659
You know I'm a mineralogist?

361
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,227
Yes.

362
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,229
I traced you
through Arizona, Idaho,

363
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,365
and all over the Comstock Lode.

364
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,501
You changed your name a couple
of times, but I found you.

365
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,272
Well, you can't take me out
of Nevada Territory.

366
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,642
Here are the extradition papers.

367
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,909
I trust, Jason, you are growing
tired of trying to run away.

368
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,984
Everything legal
and aboveboard, huh, Esketh?

369
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,686
Always.

370
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,321
Which reminds me--

371
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,591
I must present my credentials
to your local judge.

372
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,460
I had a little official business
on the way in.

373
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,292
Billy and Bob Clevenger.

374
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,432
You saw the Clevengers?

375
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,668
Briefly, through my sights.

376
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,762
They're both dead.

377
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,579
What about Gideon, the old man?

378
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,014
Always a good friend
to you, wasn't he, Jason?

379
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,317
No, I haven't seen him yet,

380
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,116
but I'll plan to see him
before he sees me.

381
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,625
You, um... seem to have built up
a nice little business here.

382
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,993
Oh, why don't you
get it over with?

383
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,695
Why don't you kill me
and have done with it?

384
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,697
No, Jason.

385
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,399
I'll kill you because that's
what I came here for.

386
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,236
But I'll pick my own time
and my own place.

387
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,671
And besides...

388
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,908
I intend to get much better
acquainted with your wife.

389
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,742
She's lovely, Jason--
completely lovely.

390
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,219
(knock at door)

391
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,535
Hello, Mariette.

392
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,739
Oh, Adam,
I'm so glad to see you.

393
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,007
What's the matter?

394
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,675
Is there something wrong?

395
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,377
Oh, no, nothing.

396
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:23,315
It's just that... I haven't
seen you for so long.

397
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,384
Where's Jason?

398
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,287
Oh, he went to the office
to, uh,

399
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,055
pick up some things.

400
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,990
Mariette...

401
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,525
you're just about as close

402
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,260
to being a sister
as I'll ever have.

403
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,923
Now, a big part of that pleasure
is being able to help you.

404
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,768
Tell me--what happened
when Gerald Esketh came here?

405
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,636
Oh, nothing happened.

406
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:49,308
I think Mr. Esketh
is a very charming person.

407
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,006
We, uh... we even had tea.

408
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,580
Oh, Adam.

409
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,916
(crying):
I just can't lie to you.

410
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,886
I've tried, but I just can't.

411
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,690
That's more like it.

412
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,124
Now, tell me about it.

413
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,229
Jason has to go to California
to be a witness in a trial.

414
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,803
Well, that doesn't sound
so terrible.

415
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,606
I know, but the men
that he has to testify against--

416
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,302
they threatened to kill him.

417
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,480
You see, that's why Jason
left California.

418
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,415
I see.

419
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,451
Did he talk to Judge Rand
about this?

420
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,586
Oh, that was
my first suggestion,

421
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,856
but Jason didn't think
it would do any good.

422
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,257
(sighs)

423
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,959
Well, Jason's upset.

424
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,562
I think I'm in a better position
to decide than he is.

425
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,064
So, why don't you and I
have a talk with Judge Rand?

426
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,567
I think we'll find that Jason
can make a legal deposition

427
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,202
right here in Virginia City.

428
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,804
Oh, Adam, could we do
something like that?

429
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,207
Well, we won't know
until we ask, will we?

430
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,341
Come on, get your hat.

431
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,503
All right.

432
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:03,849
I'm sure when we know
all the facts...

433
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,650
Adam.

434
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,420
My dear Mariette.

435
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,723
What a pleasant surprise
this is.

436
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,025
Forgive me, Your Honor.

437
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:18,063
I am United States Deputy
Marshal Gerald Esketh.

438
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,133
You're in my
federal district, Marshal.

439
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,601
If you have business here,

440
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,603
you should have presented
your documents to me.

441
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,638
I fully intended to do so, sir.

442
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,374
As a matter of fact,
I was on my way to your chambers

443
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:33,311
when your, uh, messenger
intercepted me.

444
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:36,581
Mrs. Blane states
that her husband's life

445
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,750
will be in danger if he...

446
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,981
if he gives certain testimony
in Sacramento.

447
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,591
To some extent,
she may be right.

448
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,994
I myself
will not feel too secure

449
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,962
as his pledged bodyguard.

450
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,864
Now, you will note there, sir,

451
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,734
that this is <i>The State</i>
<i>v. Hadley Murdoch</i>

452
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,803
and a number of John Does,

453
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,639
all of whom comprise
a political machine

454
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,741
known as the Murdoch Gang.

455
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,877
Now, these are
infamous men, sir,

456
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:09,181
grown fat on terrorism
and plunder.

457
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,384
So rich and powerful, indeed,
that they now have most of

458
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,120
the state of California under
their rule of dread and fear.

459
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,656
Blane is the key witness?

460
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,292
We on the side of the law
earnestly believe

461
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,861
that Jason Blane is the one man

462
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,930
who can send these culprits
to the gallows.

463
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,128
Well, your husband's duty
is clear, Mariette.

464
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,805
And we can't very well call out
the militia to guard him.

465
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:41,046
Well, I was planning a trip
to Sacramento in a week or so.

466
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,181
I could change my plans,
go along with you,

467
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,817
if it would make Mariette
feel better.

468
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,752
Oh, it would, Adam, it would.

469
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:53,658
Anything to relieve
this dear lady's anxieties.

470
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,393
And rest assured,
we'll be joined by

471
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,629
other officers in Sacramento.

472
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,631
Oh, I'm very grateful to you.

473
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,132
To all of you.

474
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,068
Uh, Mr. Esketh,
I'm terribly sorry

475
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,736
to have caused you
all this trouble.

476
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,072
It's no trouble, my dear.

477
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,642
On the contrary,
I was delighted to see revealed

478
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:14,279
that jewel which money
cannot buy: loyalty.

479
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,450
Marshal, you and Adam both--
I-I'd like to talk to you.

480
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,454
If it's, uh, if it's all right
with you, Mariette.

481
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,289
Of course not.

482
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,124
Adam, Jason will be
so pleased to know

483
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,792
that you're going with him.

484
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,784
Thank you, gentlemen, thank you.

485
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,007
It's about the killing
of the Clevenger brothers.

486
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:45,777
Ah, yes, a distasteful duty,
I assure you.

487
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,380
But there is a warrant out
in California for their arrest.

488
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,383
I was talking
to your father, Adam.

489
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,019
He was telling me that Gideon
Clevenger came to see him.

490
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,183
Yeah, but he didn't seem
to want to make any trouble.

491
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,194
Strange man--Gideon Clevenger.

492
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,965
He'll brood about
the death of his sons,

493
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,501
then he'll decide to take
the law into his own hands.

494
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:13,772
He can be very dangerous,
if he makes up his mind to it.

495
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,974
Well, the thought
of any further bloodshed

496
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,709
is completely repelling to me.

497
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,745
I'll rest a whole lot easier
when you're out of town,

498
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,338
on your way back to Sacramento.

499
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:28,320
Then you think that this, um,
Gideon Clevenger

500
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,355
will make the death
of his two sons

501
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,791
a personal issue
between himself and me?

502
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,521
I think that precisely.

503
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,552
I see.

504
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,534
Jason.

505
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,636
Jason, I have
the most wonderful news.

506
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,471
I've just come from
talking to Judge Rand.

507
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,106
You what?

508
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,574
Oh, it's all right, darling.

509
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:52,644
He's going to write a letter to
a friend in Sacramento, a judge.

510
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,546
And then Adam is
going to go with you.

511
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,814
No, no, he can't do that.

512
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,950
But, Jason,
Adam only wants to help.

513
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,120
Well, he,
well, he can't go with me.

514
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,421
But why?

515
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,390
Tell me why.

516
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,058
Because if Adam Cartwright
goes with me,

517
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,050
he'll never get there alive.

518
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,070
Jason, what are you
trying to tell me?

519
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,739
Can't we make one move
in our life

520
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,407
without the Cartwrights
getting mixed up in it?

521
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,309
But the Cartwrights
are my best friends,

522
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,944
and they're the best friends
you ever had.

523
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,713
I don't want to talk about it.

524
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,216
Jason, now, come on,
this isn't like us.

525
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,418
I'm your wife, and I have
a right to know the truth.

526
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,221
Well, I have told you the truth.

527
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,389
Tell me something.

528
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,491
Why did you say that
if Adam went with you,

529
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,492
he would be killed?

530
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,862
Because that is the truth, too.

531
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,964
Jason, I have never asked you
anything about

532
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,733
your past life before, because
it just wasn't important,

533
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,735
but now it is.

534
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,872
Now, do they want you as
a witness for something you saw

535
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,864
or for something you did?

536
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,651
What difference does it make?

537
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,421
Esketh told you about
the Murdoch gang, didn't he?

538
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,522
Yes.

539
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,923
Well, that gang
isn't going to let me

540
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,915
get to Sacramento alive.

541
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,497
Not even with Mr. Esketh
and Adam to protect you?

542
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:23,635
Don't you realize that Esketh
was sent here to kill me?

543
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,370
Once I leave here, I'll be dead

544
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,740
before I can get
as far as the Ponderosa.

545
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,277
But why would anybody
want to kill you?

546
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,846
Because that's why he came here.

547
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,382
He is a hired, paid killer.

548
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,374
Now, try to understand that.

549
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,922
Jason, there must be
something we can do.

550
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:44,923
There must be!

551
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:45,924
What?

552
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,392
You want me to get a gun?

553
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,393
Go up against him?

554
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,161
(scoffs)
He would love that.

555
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,163
Self-defense,
everything above board, legal.

556
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,898
Then why don't you
go to Judge Rand?

557
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,600
Tell him the truth,
and he'll protect you.

558
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,802
You saw his papers;
he is a marshal.

559
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,838
He has every right in the world
to take me in.

560
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,107
And you're gonna stand there
and let him do it.

561
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,268
Well, what else can I do?

562
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,044
We can go away.

563
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,245
We can go East.

564
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,346
Jason, please, please.

565
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,647
They can't reach that far.

566
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,217
Even if we have to spend
the rest of our lives hiding,

567
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,752
I don't care.

568
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,688
I'd much rather have you that
way than not have you at all.

569
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:17,956
Please.

570
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,959
Oh, if we only could.

571
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,951
If we only could.

572
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,032
It would be like
starting from the beginning.

573
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:31,025
No West, no past tense.

574
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,174
Oh, Jason.

575
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,876
Jason, we must do it.

576
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,144
We must. We can.

577
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,879
I know we can.

578
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,347
You get some things packed.

579
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,882
There's still Esketh.

580
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,617
Don't forget,
I tried this once before.

581
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,453
Oh, but don't forget,
you didn't have me before.

582
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,654
Now, I can handle him.

583
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,523
I think I know a ladies' man
when I see one.

584
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,891
Yes, I know
how to deal with him.

585
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,058
No, I can't let you do that.

586
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,293
He's too dangerous.

587
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,829
Oh, no, darling, really,
he won't be with me.

588
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,998
Please, trust me.

589
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,500
Trust me.

590
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,833
Now, hurry; hurry and get
something packed, please.

591
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:10,909
Adam, I find this a land
of unexpected pleasures.

592
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,477
Little did I dream that you'd be

593
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,746
making the trip
to Sacramento with me.

594
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,815
Well, since I am,
don't you think it, uh, might be

595
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,716
a good idea to let me in
on the truth?

596
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,386
Well, isn't that
a rather strange way

597
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,720
to put a question, Adam?

598
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,556
Well, as Pa and I both told you,

599
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,358
we think a great deal
of Mariette.

600
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:30,662
And so do I think a lot of her.

601
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,566
That's why I tried to spare her
the seriousness of Jason's case.

602
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,534
Then he's not just
a missing witness.

603
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,369
No.

604
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,404
A missing criminal.

605
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,440
But on your honor, Adam,

606
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,443
this is to go no further
in Virginia City.

607
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,713
By turning state's evidence,
he'll be able to return here

608
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,416
with no damage
to his so-called reputation.

609
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,750
Well, I appreciate whatever

610
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,352
protection you can give
Mariette.

611
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,857
You know,
I believe we think alike.

612
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,693
I even had him listed
in the documents as a witness,

613
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,559
not as one of the accused.

614
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,765
Thank you for telling me.

615
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,934
Pa'd like to get
the best lawyer he can find.

616
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:13,404
Adam, I don't want you
to think it rude of me,

617
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,640
but under the circumstances,
I think it best

618
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,876
not to return to the Ponderosa.

619
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,577
I'll take a room here
at the hotel,

620
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,946
and if it's convenient for you,
we'll leave, shall we say,

621
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,548
first thing in the morning?

622
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,616
Fine with me.

623
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,351
I'll bring your luggage
in with me.

624
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,519
And bring along
your best suit, Adam.

625
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,355
I know some pretty girls
in Sacramento,

626
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,224
and perhaps we can forget some
of the more unpleasant aspects

627
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,659
of a marshal's duties.

628
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,060
Very good.

629
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,696
If I, um, seemed a little cool
toward you,

630
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:42,567
it's--was only because of
my concern for Mariette.

631
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,470
Well, I, uh, better let Pa know
what's happened.

632
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,063
- Right.
- See you in the morning.

633
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,508
MAN:
The Clevengers!

634
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,710
(horse neighing)

635
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,712
Clevengers!

636
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,613
The Clevengers!

637
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,084
(dogs barking in distance)

638
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,085
Gid Clevenger.

639
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,553
I'd hoped this wouldn't happen.

640
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,526
Maybe we can reason with him.

641
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,194
No, Ben.

642
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,629
Let me try it.

643
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,308
Hello, Gideon.

644
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,876
We haven't seen you
for some time.

645
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,111
Save your words, Judge.

646
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,514
I know Gerald Esketh's
in this town.

647
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:30,515
Now, where is he?

648
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,517
I really don't know, Gideon.

649
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,519
Look at me when I talk to you.

650
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,654
I don't like fellers
who can't look straight.

651
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:40,591
You've lost three sons
trying to fight a private war.

652
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:43,294
Why don't you just find yourself
a rocking chair

653
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,229
and live to a ripe old age, huh?

654
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,733
I've got a better idea
that'll help a lot more people.

655
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,035
You deliver Esketh to me,

656
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:54,138
I'll get out of Virginia City
and stay out.

657
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:58,509
You don't, I got 20 more men
anxious to ride in here.

658
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,501
You're not serious.

659
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,851
I've offered you a fair deal.

660
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,911
Get me that back shooter.

661
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,727
(knocking)

662
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,862
Come in.

663
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,230
Oh, my dear Adam.

664
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,133
They tell me Gideon Clevenger's
looking for me.

665
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,868
He's threatened
to tear the whole town apart

666
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:25,703
unless you're handed over
to him.

667
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:29,474
He seems a truly
dedicated scoundrel,

668
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:33,745
faithful to his purpose,
honest to a fault.

669
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:37,148
I want you to know that
Pa and I will be backing you up.

670
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,140
Thank you kindly, Adam.

671
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,960
Shall we, uh,
look into the matter?

672
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,536
Well, you're certainly a cool
one, I'll have to admit that.

673
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,090
What are you going to do?

674
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,859
Make our friend
a sporting proposition.

675
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,851
He's in the saloon?

676
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,128
Clevenger!

677
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,612
Can you hear me?

678
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,248
I can hear you, Esketh.

679
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,184
It's a voice
I'm not likely to forget.

680
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,985
You made this personal,
Clevenger,

681
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,887
so let's keep it that way.

682
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,789
There's no sense in
harming innocent people.

683
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:55,059
You've made yourself a deal.

684
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:58,729
But if the Cartwrights or anyone
else tries to get into it,

685
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,755
I'm cutting my boys loose.

686
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,742
You're free
to change your mind anytime.

687
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:12,944
Thank you, friend,

688
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,180
but I find the arrangement
most satisfactory.

689
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,172
I've already
planned my strategy.

690
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,737
I don't like this, Adam.

691
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,968
I'm beginning to think
Esketh knows what he's doing.

692
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:12,336
Make your play, you filthy
little back shooter.

693
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,067
You first, my dear Clevenger.

694
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,724
(gunshots)

695
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,192
(women screaming)

696
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:46,331
You'd better finish
the job, Esketh.

697
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:51,067
(onlookers murmuring)

698
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,729
Adam, you'd better
get the doctor

699
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,664
and see what
we can do for Clevenger.

700
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,708
How is Clevenger?

701
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,309
He'll pull through.

702
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,301
He wants to see you.

703
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,057
I took the liberty of dropping
in without knocking.

704
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,357
Well, I was sure
the door was locked.

705
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,734
You grow lovelier
each time I see you.

706
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,904
I must look a sight.

707
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,507
A sight, indeed.

708
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,710
The very kind that inspired
Wordsworth to rhapsodize,

709
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,480
"She was a phantom of delight

710
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,816
when first she gleaned
upon my sight."

711
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,319
Now, you know
that you much prefer

712
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,055
those sophisticated
San Francisco women

713
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,724
to a country girl like myself.

714
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:17,395
I hope someday to prove
the error of that statement

715
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:25,102
by putting you beside them--
a ruby in a diadem of glass.

716
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:28,606
Oh, you mean the ones
from the Barbary Coast?

717
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,409
What lies has Jason
been telling you about me?

718
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,377
Why none, none.

719
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:36,781
It's just that I know so little
about San Francisco.

720
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:40,651
It was only a chance remark.

721
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,421
Please accept my apology.

722
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,390
I'm thin-skinned when it
comes to matters of honor.

723
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,127
Oh, I apologize, too.

724
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:53,030
I had planned to look
much more presentable

725
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,700
the next time we met.

726
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,469
Then it was rude of me
to arrive so unexpectedly,

727
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,172
but I thought I better
tell you

728
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,873
that Judge Rand suggested

729
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,975
that I start back
to Sacramento immediately.

730
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,679
Oh, so soon.

731
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,816
You don't know how
lonely it gets.

732
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,852
I mean, Jason has
to work such long hours.

733
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,448
I've never met anyone
like you, Gerald.

734
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,101
A little more time
won't matter.

735
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,833
Could you come to the hotel to
let me know when Jason is ready?

736
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,009
Just as long as you
aren't too impatient.

737
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:43,814
Now, let us not misunderstand
my honorable intentions.

738
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:48,275
I understand
your intentions perfectly.

739
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:05,236
- You little fool.
- (gasps)

740
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,905
You're going to learn just who
you've been playing games with.

741
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,840
Who?

742
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,810
What are you?

743
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,211
He's Murdoch's hatchet man.

744
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:22,953
Around the Embarcadero, they
call him the Dude Butcher Boy.

745
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:26,590
It's my reckoning he came here

746
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,692
to lead Jason Blane
to the slaughter,

747
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,428
'cause Jason knows too much.

748
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,062
Jason was mixed up with Murdoch?

749
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,765
He was the spotter
for the bunch.

750
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,168
That's easy for an assayer.

751
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,771
Whenever he'd see gold bullion,
he'd tell Esketh.

752
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,675
That slimy killer would lead
his night riders,

753
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,377
claiming they were vigilantes.

754
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:50,047
That was a good cover for him.

755
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:54,418
But Jason got sick,
and he quit and ran away.

756
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:58,189
Jason was too soft
for Esketh's shooting parties.

757
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:01,225
I saw him later
in Virginia City,

758
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,861
but I figured
let a feller go straight

759
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,129
that's trying hard.

760
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,597
And your oldest son?

761
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:11,469
Esketh back-shot my boy at
our California stamp mill,

762
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,098
while his outfit looted.

763
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:20,678
The other two--

764
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,080
you know about, Ben.

765
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,416
They wasn't killers.

766
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,986
They heard Esketh was
headed this way.

767
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,581
They mistook Adam for him.

768
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,731
That fool, Jason.

769
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:43,501
Why couldn't he tell us
the trouble he was in?

770
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,936
There's a thing called
reputation, Ben,

771
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,439
especially if you're married
to a woman like Mariette.

772
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:52,604
I'd swear she never knew
that Jason had a record.

773
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,491
- Mariette...
- No, don't!

774
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,826
It's all right, honey,
it's me, it's Adam.

775
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:09,827
Oh, Adam.

776
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,762
Where's Jason? Was Esketh here?

777
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,297
Yes.

778
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:18,769
He hit me and he slapped me,
and he wanted me to tell...

779
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,337
Did he tell you
who he really is?

780
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:23,974
Yes, and he said terrible
things about Jason.

781
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:26,810
Where is Jason? Where is he?
Where is he?

782
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,814
The... Silver Corazon Mine.

783
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,950
I'm supposed to meet him there.

784
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:37,354
He gave me
a little trail... map.

785
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,156
He took it. It's gone.

786
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,624
He took it. He took the map.

787
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,992
- Honey, shh, shh. Calm...
- He'll kill Jason.

788
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,994
- He'll...
- Calm down!

789
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:46,497
Now listen, I'll send somebody
to look after you.

790
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,433
Now, don't go away.
You stay right here, okay?

791
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,204
Jason?

792
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,216
Jason!

793
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,822
You can't get away, Jason.

794
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,043
Can you hear me?

795
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,817
Would you like to hear what
happened to your wife?

796
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,959
She died in my arms, Jason.

797
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,928
I held her.

798
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,920
I watched her.

799
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,998
Can you take that
and run away with it?

800
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,533
In here, Esketh!

801
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,435
Come on!

802
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,780
Come on!

The unruly emotions, Jason.

But don't be ashamed because
they've destroyed you.

We're in here!

815
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,329
Don't turn around.

816
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,064
Jason.

817
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:43,634
Mariette?

She's all right.

819
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,068
I'm taking you in, Esketh.

820
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:55,279
It's hot in here, isn't it?

821
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:59,016
Or is it just the uncomfortable
circumstances I find myself in?

822
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,382
- (pistol cocking)
- No.

823
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,422
It might have worked
on Clevenger,

824
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:08,091
but it won't work on me.

825
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:12,429
My dear Adam, you don't think
that I'd be childish,

826
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,625
so childish as to pull
the same chestnut twice?

827
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,805
I wish you hadn't
tried it, Esketh.

828
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,641
I suppose I...

829
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:28,635
I knew all along that this would
happen... someday.

830
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:40,357
Thank you for your...
hospitality, Ben.

831
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,627
I never dreamed
that Gerald Esketh w...

832
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,096
would be defeated by emotions.

833
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:47,831
I can't believe you
ever had any.

834
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:52,169
Oh, yes, I did.

835
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:55,806
I was in love, you know.

836
00:47:55,806 --> 00:48:00,540
I was in love
with Gerald Esketh.

837
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,051
We'll miss you very much.

838
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:13,690
Thank you, Ben,
thank you for everything.

839
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,659
Judge Rand said it shouldn't be
more than a year.

840
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,493
And that will be the longest
year of my life.

841
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:23,066
Well, I'm glad you made the
decision on your own, Jason.

842
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,069
When you come back, your house
will be here, waiting.

843
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,537
Thank you, Ben.

844
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,239
Good-bye.

845
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,809
We'll be waiting, too.

846
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,045
Things will be just the same.
