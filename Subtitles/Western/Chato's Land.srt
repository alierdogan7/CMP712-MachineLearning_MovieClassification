00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:14,834
HE'D RATHER EAT DOG
THAN BEEF.

532
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:16,200
IF HE WAS HUNGRY,

533
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:18,200
HE'D EAT
HIS OWN DUNG.

534
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:20,667
[Quincey]
WELL, NO MORE
THAN ANY OTHER MAN,

535
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:22,300
AND LESS THAN MOST.

536
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,167
THEY AREN'T MEN.

537
00:30:24,234 --> 00:30:25,801
THEY'RE ANIMALS.

538
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:27,767
YEAH, GOD KNOWS
WHAT GOD WAS THINKING

539
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:29,601
WHEN HE MADE
THE APACHE.

540
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,834
WE'LL BURN
THEM WICKIUPS

541
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:33,901
AND THEN WE'LL RIDE.

542
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:35,200
HYAH!

547
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:36,067
[Man yelling]

548
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:37,734
WE CAN'T RIDE
ACROSS THESE FLATS.

549
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,734
WE'LL TEAR THE HEARTS
OUT OF THE HORSES.

550
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:43,133
[Elias]
MALECHIE'S
RIGHT, JUBAL.

551
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,934
THE BREED WILL
RIDE ACROSS.

552
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,567
IF HE DOES, HE'LL BE
ON FOOT BEFORE NIGHT.

553
00:31:48,634 --> 00:31:51,067
HOW MANY MILES ACROSS
DO YOU FIGURE, BUELL?

554
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:52,834
ENOUGH.

555
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:54,634
WHEN WE GET
THIS DAMN INDIAN,

556
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:56,801
I'M SURE GONNA MAKE
HIS DYIN' SLOW.

557
00:31:56,868 --> 00:31:58,601
PUT GOD'S WORD
ON THAT.

558
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,901
HIM AND
HIS DAMN LAND.

559
00:32:00,968 --> 00:32:02,701
HEY, MAYBE HE'S GOT
A WOMAN OUT THERE...

560
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:03,901
SOMEPLACE.

561
00:32:03,968 --> 00:32:05,601
JEEZ, EARL,
DON'T YOU EVER

562
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,567
THINK ABOUT
NOTHIN' ELSE?

00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:11,400
[Gunshot]

565
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:14,200
DON'T LET
THE HORSES BREAK.

WHOA, HO, HO, HO.

00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:04,534
I DON'T SEE
A THING.

572
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:07,400
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.

573
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:08,868
MARTIN, YOU

574
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:10,901
YEAH.

575
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:12,968
MEXICAN ALL RIGHT?

576
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:14,734
YEAH, I SEEN
HIM MOVE.

577
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:17,334
THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY, JUBAL.

578
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,901
LET'S GET AT IT.

579
00:34:18,968 --> 00:34:20,901
NYE, ELIAS,
JUBAL, AND ME

580
00:34:20,968 --> 00:34:22,701
ARE GOING IN
AFTER HIM.

581
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:24,067
THE REST OF YOU,
SPREAD OUT

582
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:25,167
AND GIVE US COVER.

583
00:34:25,234 --> 00:34:27,167
MARTIN, YOU STAY
WITH THE HORSES.

584
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:55,434
AAH!

585
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:08,767
WE'VE BEEN
SUCKERED, QUINCEY.

586
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:11,267
THAT'S A
GOD-GIVEN FACT.

587
00:35:11,334 --> 00:35:15,400
[Speaking Spanish]

588
00:35:15,467 --> 00:35:17,868
HE SAID IT'S THE BREED
THEY CALL CHATO, ALL RIGHT.

589
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:19,901
HE CAN TELL
BY THE HORSE HE RIDES.

590
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:21,300
WELL, I DIDN'T THINK

591
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:24,901
IT WAS THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

592
00:35:24,968 --> 00:35:26,934
WE GOTTA FIND
THOSE HORSES

593
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,434
BEFORE NIGHT.

598
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:43,434

WHOA.

600
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,968
[Horse whinnying]

601
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:52,801
I SWEAR, I'M GONNA
STRETCH YOUR HIDE

602
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:58,434
AND LEAVE THE REST
FOR THE CROWS.

603
00:35:58,501 --> 00:36:02,033
2 MORE,
HOT AND READY.

604
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,701
I'LL BET THAT HORSE
TASTES BETTER
THAN HE RODE.

605
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:07,067
[Lansing] NYE,
YOU GOT YOUR OWN
MOTHER IN A SKILLET

606
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,367
BEFORE
SHE GOT COLD.

607
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:09,868
[Elias] HE NEVER
MET THE LADY.

608
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,634
[Laughing]

609
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:13,734
WHERE YOU FROM,
BRADY?

610
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:17,133
BEFORE YOU CAME OUT
TO THE TERRITORY.

611
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,834
A PLACE
CALLED GREENOCK

612
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:21,834
ON THE WEST COAST
OF SCOTLAND.

613
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:23,400
I USED TO WORK
IN LITHGOW'S YARDS,

614
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:25,634
SHIPWRIGHT.

615
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:27,334
YOU EVER
LONG FOR IT?

616
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,501
YEAH.

617
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:31,801
YEAH, WATER AND FIRE
DIFFERENT,

618
00:36:31,868 --> 00:36:34,200
THIS LAND
AND THERE.

619
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:38,601
THERE, THE RIVER,
THE SEA FOG,

620
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:43,200
GRAY STONE HOUSES
WET IN THE RAIN.

621
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,300
WE USED TO STAND
BEHIND THE TOWN

622
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:47,634
AND LOOK DOWN
OVER THE SLATE ROOFS

623
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:49,067
ACROSS THE RIVER
TO THE HIGHLANDS

624
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:50,267
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

625
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:51,467
YEAH.

626
00:36:51,534 --> 00:36:54,167
I NEVER DID GET
TO LOOK AT THE SEA.

627
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:55,968
BROTHER JUBAL
DID ONCE.

628
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:59,267
SAID IT WAS SO BIG THE
MIND COULDN'T HOLD IT.

HOT AND RARE!

630
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:05,701

TEXAS.

632
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,167
[Hall] BETTER DRAG
THEM HORSES OFF.

633
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:11,067
THEY'LL CALL ALL
THE FLIES IN BY MORNING.

634
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:12,868
[Jubal] EARL?

635
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,300
HOW ARE WE
WITH WATER?

636
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:15,667
GETTIN' SHORT.

637
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,901
AND WE'RE
3 HORSES GONE.

638
00:37:17,968 --> 00:37:21,534
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE GOING ON
AFTER HIM, QUINCEY?

639
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:24,901
WELL...

640
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:27,234
WHEN THE BREED
HIT US,

641
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,000
HE HAD A MIND
TO TURN US BACK.

642
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:31,467
AN INJUN WILL
CHASE SOMETHING

643
00:37:31,534 --> 00:37:33,234
UNTIL THE CHASIN'
COSTS TOO MUCH

644
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,534
AND THEN
HE'LL DROP IT.

645
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:35,868
THAT'S HOW
HE THINKS.

646
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:37,534
NOW, HE DON'T PLAN
ON SOMETHING

647
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:41,200
COMIN' AFTER HIM
NO MATTER WHAT.

648
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:43,968
HE MIGHT JUST GET
CARELESS NOW.

649
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:45,200
I'M AGREED.

650
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:47,534
I SAY NO MORE
THAN A WEEK FOR IT.

651
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:49,267
YOU CAN'T PUT
A HALTER ON IT.

652
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,701
I CAN FOR MYSELF.

653
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:52,200
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHERS,

654
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:53,467
HARVE AND JOSH?

655
00:37:53,534 --> 00:37:54,834
THEY GET THEIR SAY?

656
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:57,033
ANYBODY WANT
TO BACK DOWN,
THEY GO ON FOOT,

657
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,601
LEAVE THEIR WATER FOR
THEM THAT STAY WITH IT.

658
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,968
JUBAL, YOU GOT MORE
GENEROSITY THAN JUNE.

659
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:04,534
THAT'S A GEORGIA CHOICE.

660
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:06,634
I MUST SAY, IT'LL
CUT SHORT THINKING ON.

661
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,133
HA HA HA.

662
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,501
[Speaking Apache]

663
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:35,567
[Josh] NYE, WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE WE DOIN' OUT HERE?

664
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:37,200
[Buell] WE'VE GOT
INDIAN FEVER.

665
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:40,634
SWEATS IN A MAN, DRIVES
HIM BLIND IN THE EYE

666
00:39:40,701 --> 00:39:42,701
AND NOT QUITE RIGHT
IN THE HEAD.

667
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:44,968
WE AIN'T SEEN SCRATCH
NOR HAIR OF THAT BREED

668
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:46,634
SINCE HE
BUFFALOED US.

669
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:49,000
I AIN'T SURE
I WANT TO.

670
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:52,934
I GOT A BAD FEELIN'
COMIN' OVER ME, NYE.

671
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,934
I'LL BET THE MEX
GOT WATER.

672
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,234
GOT WATER,
MEX?

673
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,067
YOU'RE HOLDIN'
OUT ON US.

674
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:04,567
EARL.

675
00:40:04,634 --> 00:40:06,133
I DON'T TRUST HIM.

676
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,033
HE GOT TOO MUCH
INDIAN IN HIM.

677
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,601
HE AIN'T TRYIN'
TO FIND THE BREED.

678
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:12,667
HE'S BREED HIMSELF.

679
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:14,968
HE'S TRYIN' TO LOSE
US, I'M TELLIN' YA.

680
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:17,267
YOU STAND BY
YOUR MAN, MALECHIE?

681
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:19,300
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

682
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:20,634
YAQUI-MEX

683
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,667
IS MORE THAN
HALFWAY APACHE.

684
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:25,734
YEAH, WHY SHOULD
HE HELP US?

685
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:28,567
YOU GOT
MALECHIE'S WORD.

686
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,033
YOU GOT A SICKNESS
ON YOU, EARL.

687
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,100
CAN'T BIDE
ANYTHING INJUN.

688
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:34,534
DO YOU TRUST HIM,
CAPTAIN?

689
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,701
WELL, WE USED
APACHE SCOUTS

690
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,167
WHEN WE WENT
AFTER COCHISE.

691
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:39,501
THEY NEVER
BROKE FAITH.

692
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,367
APACHE DON'T GIVE
HIS WORD EASY,

693
00:40:41,434 --> 00:40:43,667
BUT GIVEN, I'VE NEVER
KNOWN ONE TO BREAK IT.

694
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:46,934
I GUESS IT'S SAME
WITH THE YAQUIS.

695
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,767
I'M GOING TO KILL
YOU, MEX.

696
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:51,434
UNDERSTAND?

697
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:54,400
AND THAT'S
A PROMISE.

698
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:56,834
YOU MEAN FACE ON...

699
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:58,901
OR WHEN HE GIVES YOU
HIS BACK?

700
00:40:58,968 --> 00:41:00,601
YOU'RE GONNA PUT
FOOT ON MY PATCH

701
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,834
ONCE TOO OFTEN,
MALECHIE.

702
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:06,601
YOU DON'T
FRIGHTEN ME, SONNY.

703
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:09,834
[Nye]
EARL, PUT
THE GUN DOWN.

704
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:11,634
YOU HEAR ME?

705
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:14,067
PUT IT DOWN.

706

HE GOT HIS HEELS
INTO ME, I SWEAR.

707
00:41:19,634 --> 00:41:22,000
PUT THE GUN

708
00:41:22,067 --> 00:41:23,534
RIGHT NOW.

709
00:41:32,067 --> 00:41:34,000
OOH.

ALL RIGHT.

712
00:41:37,334 --> 00:41:39,167
YOU MADE YOUR POINT.

713
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:40,234
[Moans]

714
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,200

716
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:44,400

[Rattling]

718
00:43:06,734 --> 00:43:08,634
BIG PARTY,

719
00:43:08,701 --> 00:43:11,701
WENT BY TODAY
OR DAY BEFORE.

720
00:43:11,767 --> 00:43:12,968
<i>SI.</i>

721
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:14,801
MOST LIKELY
A RAIDIN' PARTY.

722
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:16,601
OR A MURDERING
PARTY.

723
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:18,667
WE LEFT OUR WOMEN,
OUR PLACES.

724
00:43:18,734 --> 00:43:20,267
THEY COULD BE
HEADING THAT WAY.

725
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:22,801
SOME OF THESE HORSES
ARE SHOD AND UNRODE.

726
00:43:22,868 --> 00:43:24,200
IT MEANS THEY'VE--

727
00:43:24,267 --> 00:43:27,100
THEY'VE RAIDED AND
ARE ON THEIR WAY HOME.

728
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:28,734
HEADIN' NORTH?

729
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:30,400
WELL, COULD
BE COMANCHE.

730
00:43:30,467 --> 00:43:31,467
COMANCHES?

731
00:43:31,534 --> 00:43:33,334
COMANCHES AIN'T
THIS FAR SOUTH.

732
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,634
KIOWA RAID
INTO MEXICO.

733
00:43:35,701 --> 00:43:38,801
THEY'VE BEEN AS FAR
SOUTH AS YUCATAN.

734
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:41,601
COULD BE APACHES
JUST AS EASY, QUINCE.

735
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:44,200
AN INJUN DON'T RAID
WITH SO MANY EXTRA MOUNTS.

736
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:47,200
THEY'VE BEEN AND
GOT WHAT THEY WANT.

737
00:43:47,267 --> 00:43:49,200
I AGREE WITH JUBAL.

738
00:43:49,267 --> 00:43:51,534
COMANCHE.

739
00:43:51,601 --> 00:43:54,701
MAYBE A FEW KIOWA.

740
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:56,501
WELL, THAT DON'T
EASE THE MIND NONE.

741
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,934
WE MIGHT
RUN INTO THEM.

742
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,567
THAT COULD BE
REAL BAD.

743
00:43:59,634 --> 00:44:01,334
IF THEY CAUGHT US
IN THIS OPEN GROUND...

744
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,467
ME AND
THE MEX

745
00:44:02,534 --> 00:44:04,634

QUINCEY.

746
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:05,934

00:44:11,868 --> 00:44:13,767
THAT PUSHES THEM.

751
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:14,968
THE OTHERS?

752
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:16,000

753
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:18,300

00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:20,100
BUT YOU,

00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:22,300

AROUND A SMALL TOWN.
MM-MM.

[Quincey] WE'LL FIND WATER

777
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:56,334
WHY DON'T WE JUST
COME OUT WITH IT?

778
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,701
THE BREED'S LOST US.

HE DIDN'T HEAD
FOR MEXICO,

805
