1
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Fixin' toward a bloody outcome, boss.

2
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,500
Absenting myself don't change your fuckin' instructions

3
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,500
Parp

4
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,700
Parp

5
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,200
Parp

6
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,000
Parp

7
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,800
Parp

8
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,700
Slainte

9
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,700
Slainte

10
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:42,502
Parp

11
00:02:47,012 --> 00:02:47,611
Parp

12
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,614
Whoop goggle

13
00:02:57,813 --> 00:02:58,519
Whoop goggle, boop boop.

14
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:03,612
Parp

15
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:10,213
Hey!

16
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:11,910
Hey!

17
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:17,812
Get the fuck out!

18
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:20,510
He come at me with his foreign gibberish.

19
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,910
You get the fuck out while I let you get the fuck out.

20
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:27,412
You too, you get out that way.

21
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:32,411
Leave him be or you'll be riding the Goddamn sled with him.

22
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:33,622
Get out!

23
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:41,820
Parp…

24
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:46,820
Either of you cocksuckers want to talk funny at me?

25
00:03:51,827 --> 00:03:52,720
Good day, Sir.

26
00:03:58,928 --> 00:03:59,523
Good day

27
00:04:07,026 --> 00:04:07,920
Wu's out of camp.

28
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:10,222
Store him in our corner of the icehouse

29
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,221
Will you look this over?

30
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:28,920
Certainly.

31
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:33,121
Words that doing the wrong jobs,

32
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:36,532
piling on too heavy, or at odds over meaning

33
00:04:36,838 --> 00:04:37,730
I'll mark my suggestions

34
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:40,033
Nothing showy is the main thing

35
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:40,931
I understand

36
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:47,933
Shall I gather my school supplies?

37
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:48,933
I'm much obliged

38
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:54,932
That's better, isn't it?

39
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:55,932
Mm

40
00:04:58,437 --> 00:04:59,333
Over here?

41
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:11,331
I will apologize, Mr. Ellsworth, for what I am about to ask

42
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:13,030
She wants to try it on the ceiling

43
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:19,040
A coverlet, dark red, is packed with the linens in the gray leather trunk

44
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:20,041
Back at the hotel

45
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:20,940
It's...

46
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:23,941
near time in any case to take Sofia to school

47
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:28,040
The settee is best sited with its spread upon it,

48
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:29,842
would be your mother's idea

49
00:05:29,945 --> 00:05:32,843
Mr. Ellsworth will help you gather your things, Darling, for school

50
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:34,340
Young lady

51
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:35,340
Goodbye

52
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:36,640
Bye

53
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:39,952
Will I bring you back a sandwich or a glass of milk?

54
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,753
Just the coverlet, thank you

55
00:05:46,757 --> 00:05:49,750
I'd sooner be hanging from those hustings \Nthan stand on 'em giving a speech

56
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:53,753
Nuttall's bartender's no hand at it either

57
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:56,752
We both may get pelted with refuse

58
00:06:09,558 --> 00:06:09,753
Morning

59
00:06:10,058 --> 00:06:10,753
Good morning, Sofia

60
00:06:11,158 --> 00:06:11,753
Good morning

61
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,450
Will we bake bread again today?

62
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,050
Is it your vote we should?

63
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:18,062
Yes

64
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:21,461
And Mr. Bullock for Sheriff, and Mr. Star for Mayor

65
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:24,763
And I will put the bread in to bake

66
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,563
If I'm to believe what I read, you're heavily scheduled today

67
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:28,563
Yes

68
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:31,663
As to your meetin' with Hearst,

69
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,163
if the chance comes up natural,

70
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:35,663
stomp on the cocksucker's foot

71
00:06:44,765 --> 00:06:45,061
Morning

72
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:46,863
Yes, Ma'am

73
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:54,860
Off to the Bella Union like the moth to the fucking flame

74
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,471
Miss Stubb's didn't name her destination

75
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:59,571
I'm telling you where she's going

76
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:04,471
And why don't you look for honest work?

77
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:07,072
Miss Stubbs holds what I'm doing for honest

78
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,970
She no more needs a watchman than she does a fucking balloonist

79
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:13,370
And why should the young of this camp

80
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:17,972
have to scurry past your man-toad figure to receive an education?

81
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:21,472
The time they come for schoolin', I'm in back and out of sight

82
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:24,672
Exposin' them to being terrified only when they use the privy

83
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,570
Go get your load on, Jane

84
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:29,273
Do not instruct me how to spend my day…

85
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:37,182
or to itemize for you my crowded itinerary…

86
00:07:39,186 --> 00:07:41,180
you tub of blubber and guts!

87
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:46,183
I've got 10 minutes yet to be out front!

88
00:08:06,588 --> 00:08:09,181
Might I give over the little one to you here?

89
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,180
Of  course

90
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:12,582
When next we meet, young lady,

91
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:15,582
I will be on the eye for warm bread

92
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:23,181
Wants a coverlet from storage-Mrs. Ellsworth-to consider atop the day bed

93
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:26,883
Framing of a dream

94
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:30,882
He's saying that to you, Seth

95
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:40,790
Mr. Ellsworth, no doubt on some menial domestic errand

96
00:08:45,295 --> 00:08:46,293
Sheriff!

97
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:48,192
Forgive my raucous tone

98
00:08:48,498 --> 00:08:49,290
Mr. Swearengen

99
00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:51,390
May we have a word?

100
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,391
Once I've see 'em to school, I meet Hearst

101
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:55,390
Very much what I'd have us speak of

102
00:08:57,097 --> 00:08:58,891
Can we plant beets again today?

103
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:00,491
Yes

104
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:08,690
"Thank you…Thank you for the introduction, Sheriff."

105
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:10,601
Sheriff

106
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:12,103
Morning, Charlie

107
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:13,301
Morning

108
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:14,800
Miss Bullock

109
00:09:14,806 --> 00:09:15,800
Good morning, Mr. Utter

110
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:18,501
Morning there, little one, in your lovely go-to-school outfit

111
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:19,602
Good morning

112
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:21,901
Did the evening pass in quiet?

113
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:24,200
The morning got a little busy

114
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:26,203
Cornishman killed in the Gem

115
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:29,212
His buddies come babbling to our office

116
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:31,311
Dority kill him?

117
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:35,613
The complainants can't speak right so I had to have them play act

118
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:36,810
But I'm guessing no

119
00:09:37,616 --> 00:09:38,212
They up in the office still?

120
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:39,913
Down in Hearst's shafts

121
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:42,711
We'll  say goodbye

122
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:44,212
Goodbye

123
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,010
Goodbye, Sofia

124
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:46,311
Goodbye

125
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,121
Goodbye there, little one

126
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:48,320
Goodbye

127
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:50,223
Thank you

128
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,120
Hi Dorothy

129
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,121
Good morning, James

130
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,122
Good morning

131
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,720
Nice thing, ain't it?

132
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:04,021
The children?

133
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:12,622
Will you attend the evening speeches, Richardson?

134
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:14,122
If you let me

135
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:14,921
Of course I will

136
00:10:15,637 --> 00:10:17,933
How else are you to vote with intelligence?

137
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:21,232
I intend no lengthy remarks

138
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:23,632
My tenure as Mayor speaks for me

139
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,333
Will they have the Jew merchant instead?

140
00:10:32,737 --> 00:10:34,431
Well, let them then and welcome

141
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,131
I caught you, Richardson

142
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,332
Stuffin' spitbacks in your vile maw

143
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:41,033
"Let tomorrow's omelets go empty."

144
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:42,931
Is that your fuckin' attitude?

145
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,234
You hurted me

146
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:44,749
Shhh!

147
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:47,042
Wash and stack, shit monkey

148
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,841
Or ready yourself for worse

149
00:11:02,547 --> 00:11:03,643
Florence Nightingale

150
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:06,443
Florence Nightingale is a nurse

151
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:09,143
I know that, ya ignorant cocksucker

152
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:11,541
Joanie Stubbs is a cocksucker

153
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:14,443
I know that, you ignorant fuck

154
00:11:15,946 --> 00:11:17,343
Don't be sweatin' all over the gentleman's money

155
00:11:19,348 --> 00:11:19,842
1500

156
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:22,652
And thank you for that rasher of shit

157
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:28,852
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses

158
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:33,253
as we forgive those who trespass against us

159
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:40,351
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,

160
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:45,450
for Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory,forever and ever

161
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:47,650
Amen

162
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:57,551
Morning, Tess

163
00:11:57,855 --> 00:11:58,553
Morning, Joanie

164
00:11:59,155 --> 00:11:59,752
Git

165
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:02,650
I can take him that

166
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:03,263
I got it

167
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:06,763
How's Cy?

168
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:08,363
I don't know yet, Tess

169
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:10,662
It's none of your business anyway

170
00:12:12,368 --> 00:12:15,562
Your only business is how you start the fucking day

171
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:16,761
I'm clean

172
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:19,861
Before you go to sleep, how are you supposed to start?

173
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:21,661
I said I'm clean

174
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,461
You answer my Goddamn question

175
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:24,460
My snatch is clean

176
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,172
Is the rest of your body clean?

177
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:26,573
Yes

178
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:27,872
What's next?

179
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:31,172
The room where I receive, and that's fucking clean

180
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:32,370
Well what's next after that?

181
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:33,370
God damn you, Joanie

182
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:36,970
What's next, Lila, if you ain't too fucking high?

183
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:37,970
Our room where we rest

184
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:40,173
Which don't it fuckin' stink in here?

185
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,971
It does, Lila, like a hogwhore's cunt.

186
00:12:44,686 --> 00:12:45,880
And I ain't loaded not to smell it

187
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:46,882
Why don't you go, girl?

188
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:49,683
Why don't you get to the muck where you're fuckin' headed anyway?

189
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:51,582
Go on. Git

190
00:12:56,287 --> 00:12:57,582
What are you doin' sittin' back there?

191
00:12:58,388 --> 00:12:59,481
Oh, please let me stay

192
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:04,382
When I come back tonight, you better all be sweet for me to fuck

193
00:13:04,888 --> 00:13:07,681
Or have your damn bags packed, 'cause I'll throw every one of you out

194
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,283
Move, Tess, move

195
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:17,083
you know she's going to let her stay

196
00:13:29,898 --> 00:13:33,092
Come  on in, Honey. How are you?

197
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:35,492
I'm all right

198
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:38,091
Was the Doc by?

199
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:41,492
Brightened my early mornin'

200
00:13:42,095 --> 00:13:44,690
Another day on the right side of the ledger far as puss

201
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:50,993
How's the action outside?

202
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:52,390
It's quiet

203
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,993
Either clown upright to tell you what the action was?

204
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:55,693
I  didn't ask.

205
00:13:56,798 --> 00:13:58,991
I guess you'd stopped in on the whores

206
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:07,793
Well, you might have mistook, Cy, pickin' Tess over Lila to see to 'em

207
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:08,903
Lila's on the needle

208
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:10,403
Well, Tess ain't pickin' up the bit

209
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:12,602
Maybe she's unsure of her place,

210
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:14,703
you in and out of our lives

211
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:19,000
Well, fresh water

212
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:22,402
You're not leaving yet, are you?

213
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:24,901
Right here, Cy, on the side table

214
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:27,900
Act like a fucking baby, don't I?

215
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:29,502
"Oh, don't go."

216
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:32,700
Where's my Good Book, honey?

217
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,803
just next to you, in the bedfold

218
00:14:47,475 --> 00:14:49,471
I've been scooping out rain gutters for a month

219
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:51,870
My fingers are bloody with sandin'

220
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:55,521
You do recall you're only the transactions beard?

221
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:02,852
You return to Star. A sorry run at the tables,

222
00:15:03,497 --> 00:15:05,512
you can't support the loan he made you

223
00:15:06,476 --> 00:15:07,813
Well, what if he don't foreclose?

224
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:10,220
Oh, you beg him to buy you out. You may harm yourself

225
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:13,133
You're up all hours, "What have I fucking done?" Or the like

226
00:15:13,635 --> 00:15:15,120
"Maybe I should fucking end it."

227
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,602
Star ends owning that house is the necessary fucking conclusion

228
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:20,251
Coffee!

229
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:21,593
Ready

230
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:23,693
That croaker seen to?

231
00:15:23,728 --> 00:15:26,343
At Wu's icehouse, under a tarp, in our corner

232
00:15:27,105 --> 00:15:28,683
Will you pour it without scalding me, huh?

233
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:29,861
Breakfast?

234
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:35,360
Bacon and eggs

235
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:41,910
You know you could have said that before I went down

236
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,212
You get in the kitchen

237
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,453
I liked living in that place

238
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:56,460
Why do I give a fuck?

239
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:09,950
So why not force this morning's murder outside?

240
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:10,952
You told us not to

241
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:14,160
As he stank of a put-up job,

242
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:17,530
I wanted to find out if we were meant for the venue

243
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:21,122
Well, whoever put the job up can't be any too smart,

244
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:23,893
'cause them Cornish work for Hearst

245
00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:26,813
Murder a Cornish and you buy Hearst for an enemy

246
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,521
You're a fucking miracle, Johnny

247
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,721
It's close to a mortal certainty he ordered the murder himself

248
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,221
Hearst?

249
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,221
Shut up!

250
00:16:36,716 --> 00:16:38,552
He stages a murder in my fucking joint

251
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,573
Wants Bullock to show his ass before he'll bless his fucking candidacy

252
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:44,990
What does he require of the weather?

253
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:47,052
Jesus Christ

254
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:50,611
That's it-how you clean a fuckin' bloodstain, hey

255
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:53,162
What if we stretched out the payments?

256
00:16:53,605 --> 00:16:54,491
I cannot fucking make it

257
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:56,531
What the fuck was in my head to sign that note?

258
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:57,472
Take it easy

259
00:16:57,865 --> 00:16:59,163
Take it easy, Mr. Adams

260
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:00,533
Take it off me

261
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:01,202
Can't  you?

262
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:03,511
Ain't there some way to take it off?!

263
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,033
Oh God!

264
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:14,680
I'm in crisis too, needing awfully to piss

265
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:25,870
Why not cork up and go on stage with that tragic fuckin' minstrel turn?

266
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:27,841
Are you alone?

267
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:30,771
Yes, Miss Bernhardt, I am

268
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:33,832
Al wants Star to take over that house

269
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:35,333
Why?

270
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:38,932
Keep my ruddy color not askin' Al his reasons

271
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:56,321
Disarray…

272
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:58,021
in your room

273
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:01,810
Your last day when you left, disarray

274
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:03,570
I sat on the bed

275
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:04,742
I won't have it

276
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,103
Did you hear me, Shaunessy?

277
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,581
My last day I sat on the bed for three hours

278
00:18:09,726 --> 00:18:11,071
I had a glass of water

279
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:12,853
Yes yes yes Very likely

280
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:15,793
Uh, 1-F, $2

281
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:25,822
The book, please

282
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:38,733
Ink on the floor

283
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:41,252
Pen near blunted, possibly broke

284
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:42,910
Binding's damaged.

285
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:46,510
I won't stand for it

286
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:49,722
Give that back to the gimp

287
00:19:04,975 --> 00:19:07,211
What the fuck you trying to pull with Adam's fuckin' house?

288
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:09,320
Star needs to move into that

289
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,112
He's a candidate for office

290
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:13,593
He can't whore-fuck no longer with impunity

291
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:16,971
Who says I want to live in that house?

292
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:17,630
You ain't

293
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:20,551
You're installing at fucking Shaunessey's

294
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:22,993
The fuck if I'll live in that shithole

295
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:26,700
Shaunessy being richer by 50 for his common wall with Star's home-to-be

296
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:28,561
and the passage he cut through it,

297
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:31,702
so you and the Jew can fall upon each other away from prying eyes

298
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:34,472
Fuck you, Al

299
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:36,532
Fuck Shaunessey's

300
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:40,430
And fuck the passage into Adam's fuckin' house

301
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:43,972
Loopy cunt!

302
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:16,021
The wrist business on Adam's house loan,

303
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:19,621
Adams being nothing but his fucking stalking horse

304
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:21,071
from the gambit's fucking beginning

305
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:23,121
You sign to take those over,

306
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:25,163
we'll move in your 12 possessions

307
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:28,390
You will be free to come and go by your own front fucking door,

308
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:30,531
and as you lay in your beddy-bye,

309
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:32,551
I'll pop from the wall

310
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:35,000
like Grandma Groundhog in a storybook

311
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:36,882
and attend to your Johnson,

312
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:39,572
as he'd not see you jeopardize your Mayor's campaign

313
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:41,451
whore fucking in your place of business

314
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,053
And I'll have installed

315
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:46,123
in room 3-fucking-C or the like

316
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:48,012
of Shaunessey's adjacent shitbox

317
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:50,823
that he's paid Shaunessey to cut a hole through

318
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:52,921
to ease my fuckin' fucking you

319
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:55,662
Swearengen has?

320
00:20:56,337 --> 00:20:58,820
Who the fuck was I just talking to?

321
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:01,700
I don't know. You said you'd just gone to piss

322
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:10,480
Man of the hour

323
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:12,640
Quick prick-suck, Bullock?

324
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:16,392
Sally forth to meet the great man with unencumbered thoughts?

325
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:18,160
What happened in here this morning?

326
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,290
Charlie Utter says a man was murdered,

327
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:21,473
one of Hearst's workers

328
00:21:22,526 --> 00:21:25,661
I'd spare you the particulars till after your meeting concludes

329
00:21:25,627 --> 00:21:26,393
Why

330
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:28,241
Why ask why?

331
00:21:28,508 --> 00:21:30,590
Why not honor the meeting's purpose?

332
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:33,291
Speak as a candidate of your hopes for the camp

333
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:34,650
and its future,

334
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:36,862
confine yourself to generalities

335
00:21:46,427 --> 00:21:47,502
Suppose Hearst…

336
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,141
was this murder's architect?

337
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,560
Suppose the workers were thieves or

338
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:54,763
organizers?

339
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:56,661
Why  kill 'em in camp before witnesses?

340
00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:59,762
Maybe as message to me his domain includes my fucking joint,

341
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:01,413
and to test your willingness

342
00:22:01,545 --> 00:22:04,241
to bend to his fucking will before he backs your candidacy

343
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:09,133
What we know, fucking Bullock, is

344
00:22:09,517 --> 00:22:10,631
if when you two meet,

345
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,651
Hearst does ask you to go easy,

346
00:22:12,986 --> 00:22:15,080
and you, for love of his type, say "Fuck yourself,"

347
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,302
no more illumination can come to us,

348
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:20,241
because you will have muddied the fuckin' waters

349
00:22:23,986 --> 00:22:25,680
Is why I'd hoped you'd skirt the topic

350
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:29,822
Has the body been eaten?

351
00:22:30,978 --> 00:22:32,940
The Cornish croaker? Wu's out of fucking camp

352
00:22:33,845 --> 00:22:34,701
Don't let it get eaten

353
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:36,891
Oh, absolutely

354
00:22:37,517 --> 00:22:38,913
till your further full investigation

355
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:40,752
As for your meeting with Hearst,

356
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:44,182
may I offer a fervent Godspeed and hopes

357
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:47,223
for your fucking self-control?!

358
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:57,902
What am I, Lord,

359
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:01,171
that I'm so helpless?

360
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:23,110
Bullock.

361
00:23:24,587 --> 00:23:25,802
He ascends, Richardson,

362
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:27,812
to be dug at

363
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:29,240
and sifted and shoveled

364
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,141
till his crucial vein is exposed

365
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:35,201
Then Hearst will empty him out

366
00:23:37,697 --> 00:23:38,982
Much anticipated, Mr. Bullock

367
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:41,590
some good solid talk between us

368
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:42,891
What do you drink?

369
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:43,802
No

370
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:44,781
thanks

371
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:46,741
I believe I won't either

372
00:23:51,788 --> 00:23:54,422
I'm told that you operate a hardware concern

373
00:23:55,515 --> 00:23:56,453
I'm partnered with Sol Star

374
00:23:56,908 --> 00:23:58,030
Ah, candidate for Mayor

375
00:23:58,616 --> 00:23:59,572
as you are for Sheriff

376
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,433
And an officer

377
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:07,681
of the Deadwood bank

378
00:24:11,387 --> 00:24:12,461
Sol's chief officer,

379
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:13,611
yes

380
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:15,753
And you are an officer too

381
00:24:17,147 --> 00:24:17,711
Yes

382
00:24:18,345 --> 00:24:23,071
The bank capitalized, as I understand, by Mrs. Alma Garret Ellsworth…

383
00:24:26,206 --> 00:24:28,882
Formerly quartered in this hotel and who has struck

384
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:30,832
so rich in these hills

385
00:24:32,457 --> 00:24:33,791
Way back second to you

386
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:35,341
Extraordinary,

387
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,102
the story of that woman's adventures

388
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:42,391
Do you suppose that its future chapters might be written…

389
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:45,132
elsewhere than the hills?

390
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:51,330
What are your intentions?

391
00:24:51,996 --> 00:24:57,243
As to Mrs. Ellsworth's holdings, I would shape those to the lady's preferences,

392
00:24:58,418 --> 00:25:01,140
and be pleased and grateful if you told her

393
00:25:06,578 --> 00:25:09,132
Do you need a handkerchief, Mr. Bullock?

394
00:25:11,807 --> 00:25:12,432
No

395
00:25:13,657 --> 00:25:16,763
Unfortunate incident this morning at Swearengen's saloon

396
00:25:17,636 --> 00:25:18,520
Do you know about it?

397
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:21,862
No

398
00:25:22,285 --> 00:25:25,070
One of my workmen was killed in a drunken shootout

399
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,021
How will you deal with that, Sheriff?

400
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:28,970
Depends

401
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:30,920
what it was about? Who makes complaints?

402
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:32,200
Mmm

403
00:25:32,535 --> 00:25:34,071
My worker was Cornish

404
00:25:34,386 --> 00:25:35,870
They are a clannish people

405
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:38,430
I suppose another Cornish might complain

406
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:40,462
I'd need to hear what he said then

407
00:25:40,786 --> 00:25:43,272
He may also indict the sunrise

408
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,262
For men of that sort,

409
00:25:46,037 --> 00:25:48,390
events such as these are as natural

410
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:50,953
Anyways

411
00:25:51,428 --> 00:25:53,202
May we speak of your ambitions?

412
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:54,810
Another time

413
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:56,800
I would want to support them, you see?

414
00:25:57,045 --> 00:25:57,971
I would want to back you

415
00:25:58,145 --> 00:25:59,171
to thank you

416
00:25:59,657 --> 00:26:00,951
for taking her my message

417
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:04,691
I never said I'd take her your message

418
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:05,910
Are you saying now that you won't?

419
00:26:06,355 --> 00:26:07,372
You stay out of our fuckin' affairs

420
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:09,950
Oh…

421
00:26:11,845 --> 00:26:15,103
affairs of that sort are not my interest, Mr. Bullock

422
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:19,170
My only passion is the color

423
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:23,832
Excuse me

424
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:31,162
Bullock,

425
00:26:31,727 --> 00:26:32,711
how did you like Mr. Hearst?

426
00:26:35,075 --> 00:26:35,491
What are you doin'?!

427
00:26:38,725 --> 00:26:40,072
You piece of shit

428
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:42,280
How have I given offense?

429
00:26:42,616 --> 00:26:43,411
You told him

430
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:46,583
Call the law

431
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,843
The Sheriff's killing the mayor

432
00:27:03,147 --> 00:27:03,872
In the thoroughfare,

433
00:27:04,476 --> 00:27:05,552
if I fucking need you

434
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:07,392
Bullock?

435
00:27:08,388 --> 00:27:09,242
Bullock…

436
00:27:09,648 --> 00:27:10,413
Bullock!

437
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:14,932
Why are you beating Farnum in Mr. Hearst's hotel?

438
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:15,913
How are you , Sir?

439
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,192
I am well, Mr. Swearengen,

440
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:18,970
and how are you?

441
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:20,233
Bullock!

442
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:25,980
Shall I have him seen to, Sir?

443
00:27:27,036 --> 00:27:28,192
He seems to need that

444
00:27:29,185 --> 00:27:30,401
My place, Sheriff?

445
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:31,602
Boys!

446
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:32,953
E.B.'s had an accident

447
00:27:33,488 --> 00:27:34,332
Under your supervision,

448
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,981
and then inform us on his further transport

449
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,082
Yes

450
00:27:40,135 --> 00:27:41,673
Give the poor fuck your shoulders, boys, huh?

451
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:42,250
Sheriff!

452
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:46,943
Much experienced at the enterprise, Sir

453
00:27:47,557 --> 00:27:48,451
I haven't a doubt

454
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:50,852
And once he's situated, may you and me speak?

455
00:27:51,206 --> 00:27:51,710
Of course

456
00:27:53,246 --> 00:27:54,243
You saw fuckin' nothing

457
00:28:03,226 --> 00:28:04,812
Jesus, Joseph and Mary

458
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:06,842
Mrs. Ellsworth?

459
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:09,342
No

460
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:11,162
You must drink this

461
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:13,583
I will not awaken that demon, Doctor

462
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:17,451
This has nothing to do with demons, Mrs. Ellsworth

463
00:28:17,878 --> 00:28:20,363
This has to do with allaying the pain to get you through

464
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,132
Leave the demons to God and trust the pain to me

465
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,902
"A lady should not choose a man

466
00:28:39,388 --> 00:28:40,261
who chews tobacco."

467
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:51,862
"It robs his pocket,

468
00:28:52,637 --> 00:28:53,741
soils his clothes…

469
00:28:54,627 --> 00:28:56,520
and makes a chimney of his nose."

470
00:28:58,417 --> 00:28:59,053
Good, peek

471
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:02,103
if one of 'em sees you, they give up attendance forever

472
00:29:03,017 --> 00:29:06,223
I suppose you didn't come to peek in

473
00:29:07,176 --> 00:29:09,060
I came to shit in the privy,

474
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:12,453
which is where you're supposed to be during school hours

475
00:29:13,306 --> 00:29:15,472
How does it feel to take one sitting up?

476
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:31,950
"The Jews burn sacrifices upon an altar of stone."

477
00:29:44,028 --> 00:29:45,492
Altars of the kind in the sentence

478
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,582
are spelled "T-A-R,"

479
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:52,410
It's not so important always to be right, Mary,

480
00:29:53,346 --> 00:29:54,180
or to be first

481
00:30:03,286 --> 00:30:06,831
"Indians are sometimes very cruel."

482
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:10,392
I'm pulling out as a candidate

483
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:11,482
No, you aren't

484
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:13,921
He'll use knowing to try to control me,

485
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:15,793
have his way in the camp's affairs

486
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:18,160
He asked me to get her to sell

487
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:21,331
Oh, best leave the camp entirely as penance for having a prick

488
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:23,001
You were right about the killing

489
00:30:23,226 --> 00:30:24,273
He didn't want it pursued

490
00:30:27,016 --> 00:30:27,740
Bleeding?

491
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:28,911
He stopped

492
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,722
Put him up on the fucking bed then

493
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,480
No grand gestures, fucking Bullock,

494
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:34,062
till I've had my talk with Hearst

495
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:35,693
Do no fucking withdraw

496
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:38,963
And no more beating up on Farnum that has to run against Star

497
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:47,001
It's no certainty

498
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:50,381
Hearst knew one Goddamn thing about Bullock putting it to the widow

499
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:52,431
Hell of a beating for E.B. to take if he's innocent

500
00:30:52,537 --> 00:30:54,843
Oh, he's still way ahead of the game. Nonetheless,

501
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:58,560
we must now assume that Hearst does fucking know

502
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,292
As going mad in front of him,

503
00:31:00,645 --> 00:31:02,561
Bullock might have tipped him as to the state of things

504
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:04,141
How are you gonna go at Hearst?

505
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:05,510
Don't I yearn for the days

506
00:31:05,787 --> 00:31:08,780
a draw across the throat made fucking resolution?

507
00:31:12,065 --> 00:31:12,781
Why, Dan,

508
00:31:13,656 --> 00:31:16,240
by composing my thoughts, tropes and gambits

509
00:31:17,057 --> 00:31:19,003
for the talk between us that is yet to come

510
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:23,620
Will you excuse me?

511
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:27,261
Sure

512
00:31:34,757 --> 00:31:35,303
Is she dying?

513
00:31:36,056 --> 00:31:38,260
She's not in imminent danger

514
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:40,701
The baby?

515
00:31:41,425 --> 00:31:42,803
Your wife is still with child

516
00:31:44,885 --> 00:31:46,151
I saw the blood on the floor

517
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,092
There wasn't as much blood as I'm sure it seemed to you

518
00:31:50,457 --> 00:31:53,631
Mrs. Ellsworth must remain abed,

519
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:56,620
And she must take the medicine I've given her,

520
00:31:56,877 --> 00:31:58,391
her fear of it notwithstanding

521
00:31:59,147 --> 00:32:01,841
And you must remain strong at her side

522
00:32:05,345 --> 00:32:07,310
I have to collect the child May I ask you to st

523
00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:09,112
I'll stay here till you come back,

524
00:32:09,236 --> 00:32:10,970
and then I'll go collect Trixie to help you

525
00:32:11,685 --> 00:32:12,421
Thank you, Doctor

526
00:32:19,525 --> 00:32:21,411
Who the fuck are all these people?

527
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,623
Guess the stages are gonna be crowded

528
00:32:24,177 --> 00:32:25,443
Headed to collect the Missus?

529
00:32:38,755 --> 00:32:39,711
I just beat Farnum

530
00:32:45,486 --> 00:32:46,390
Meeting Hearst,

531
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:48,452
I got the idea someone

532
00:32:49,516 --> 00:32:50,571
had told him bidness of mine

533
00:32:50,837 --> 00:32:51,711
Figured it was Farnum?

534
00:32:53,245 --> 00:32:53,951
If it'd been me, I'da

535
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:54,643
gone ahead and killed him

536
00:32:54,758 --> 00:32:55,720
I wonder now

537
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:57,680
if I might have mistook

538
00:32:57,706 --> 00:32:58,461
Fuck Farnum anyway

539
00:32:59,027 --> 00:33:01,022
If I tipped Hearst myself, is what I'm wondering now

540
00:33:01,698 --> 00:33:02,190
Ah

541
00:33:02,597 --> 00:33:03,611
And of my temper generally,

542
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:04,761
I'm wondering about

543
00:33:05,348 --> 00:33:06,532
far as running for office

544
00:33:08,056 --> 00:33:09,611
Maybe you just don't want to speak tonight

545
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:10,733
I know

546
00:33:11,035 --> 00:33:12,061
I don't want to speak

547
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:15,271
wondering if I ought to withdraw

548
00:33:19,086 --> 00:33:20,242
Talking against my own interests

549
00:33:21,317 --> 00:33:23,761
being if you pull out, I won't have to speak from the audience

550
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,950
far as conversing with your rival,

551
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:29,201
what's your best fuckin' experience?

552
00:33:32,065 --> 00:33:32,723
Harry Manning?

553
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:33,790
Huh

554
00:33:34,728 --> 00:33:36,881
I guess that once the two of us talked to him

555
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:39,153
When he killed Bummer Dan by mistake

556
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,172
And that was high fucking water

557
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:47,012
So you'd hold me as fair calling Harry fucking outright

558
00:33:47,746 --> 00:33:48,481
dimwitted?

559
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:54,063
You think better than the Sheriff with a shortish temper,

560
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,011
which in certain Sheriffing situations is a plus,

561
00:33:59,975 --> 00:34:01,231
camp be better with Harry?

562
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:10,770
Anyways

563
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:13,892
You gonna have dinner with us?

564
00:34:15,677 --> 00:34:18,433
May be my last fucking meal if apoplexy takes me

565
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:20,622
off my nervousness

566
00:34:27,876 --> 00:34:28,921
What if you won?

567
00:34:30,516 --> 00:34:31,062
I won't

568
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:33,452
I'm only in it to make myself known

569
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:35,731
Say you're fucking elected, Harrry,

570
00:34:36,737 --> 00:34:39,023
am I entitled to the fucking livery abandoned

571
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:42,492
by the Nigger Hosteteler leaving its stock to starve?

572
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:45,163
Well, I know you've took up its care

573
00:34:45,486 --> 00:34:46,510
And do you as Sheriff

574
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:48,962
hold my fucking labor speaks for me,

575
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,181
my diligent fuckin' efforts the last six fuckin' weeks?

576
00:34:53,606 --> 00:34:54,872
Well, uh, I'd hold with the law, Steve,

577
00:34:55,656 --> 00:34:57,420
whatever statute applied

578
00:34:57,748 --> 00:34:59,851
Well, oughtn't a "statue" have to do with justice

579
00:35:00,588 --> 00:35:02,823
and not just to bait back a fled fucking nigger

580
00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:04,821
looking to steal what a white man's worked for?

581
00:35:05,366 --> 00:35:06,573
Well, Hostetler ain't come back

582
00:35:07,276 --> 00:35:08,250
Why think he ever will?

583
00:35:08,658 --> 00:35:10,200
Because it's my family luck

584
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:12,232
over centuries

585
00:35:12,835 --> 00:35:14,831
to get repeatedly fucked up the ass

586
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:17,892
And here in this fucking camp

587
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:20,133
is where the chain gets fucking broken

588
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:22,981
And I'm askin' if you as Sheriff

589
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:24,523
will stand with me?!

590
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:28,960
Yeah, I ain't Sheriff

591
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:31,622
I got problems enough today without

592
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:33,252
kiting checks on tomorrow's

593
00:35:35,697 --> 00:35:37,421
That was a wiggle

594
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:40,401
worthy of a fucking reptile, Harry

595
00:35:43,746 --> 00:35:44,683
Bullock took a position?

596
00:35:44,985 --> 00:35:45,872
I ain't asked Bullock!

597
00:35:46,595 --> 00:35:47,472
Fool that I am,

598
00:35:47,786 --> 00:35:49,331
I figured I'd give you first crack

599
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:51,562
on the basis of our friendship

600
00:35:52,586 --> 00:35:54,201
But I guess I was mistaken

601
00:36:01,218 --> 00:36:02,162
I've got an idea

602
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:06,292
Instead of running for office and tending bar

603
00:36:07,186 --> 00:36:11,393
why don't you just tend bar and let everybody punch you in the face?

604
00:36:20,956 --> 00:36:21,650
Hello, Jane

605
00:36:26,877 --> 00:36:27,561
Yeah, hello

606
00:36:33,515 --> 00:36:36,262
Several of the children's parents have told them you scouted for Custer

607
00:36:38,107 --> 00:36:38,743
I can't hear you!

608
00:36:40,988 --> 00:36:44,282
Severa of the children's parents have told them you scouted for Custer

609
00:36:45,718 --> 00:36:48,651
Not that the arrogant bastard ever heeded others' counsel

610
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:54,882
Shall we fashion a story about your experiences, Jane,

611
00:36:55,486 --> 00:36:56,522
for the children to hear?

612
00:36:58,057 --> 00:36:59,952
Do you talk this low when you're teaching the children?

613
00:37:02,525 --> 00:37:05,871
Shall we fashion a story about your experiences, Jane,

614
00:37:06,238 --> 00:37:07,320
for the children to hear?

615
00:37:09,585 --> 00:37:10,730
Uh, I best say no

616
00:37:12,665 --> 00:37:15,012
My funds just now all go for liquor

617
00:37:16,387 --> 00:37:16,951
I see

618
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:18,781
I fine myself

619
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:20,660
for swearing amongst the young

620
00:37:22,796 --> 00:37:23,510
And just now,

621
00:37:23,857 --> 00:37:25,431
I need my money for booze

622
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,922
We'd tell your story to avoid those

623
00:37:34,527 --> 00:37:37,163
Does that Mose Manuel horrify the children?

624
00:37:37,937 --> 00:37:38,361
No

625
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:39,813
Gives 'em bad dreams at night?

626
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:41,801
No, the children like Mose

627
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:43,590
I expect he pisses you off

628
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:45,030
No

629
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:47,400
Well, he irritates the hell out of me

630
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,611
Oh, I was just going, Sheriff

631
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:53,601
I thought I left a bottle in here

632
00:37:53,868 --> 00:37:57,480
Must've left it in the shitpile outside

633
00:37:57,846 --> 00:37:58,602
Goodbye, Jane

634
00:38:03,756 --> 00:38:04,622
Good afternoon

635
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,922
How was your meeting with Mr. Hearst?

636
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:27,201
We needn't be afraid is the main thing

637
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:29,692
She'll not be

638
00:38:30,427 --> 00:38:31,553
of a sudden taken

639
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:32,772
or the like

640
00:38:33,487 --> 00:38:34,471
The Doctor's guaranteed it

641
00:38:37,078 --> 00:38:37,721
So

642
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:39,211
when we're with her,

643
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:40,941
we needn't be worried

644
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:01,953
Do you want to keep it?

645
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:06,492
May not be a matter of my choosing

646
00:39:08,238 --> 00:39:10,020
As I suppose we both fucking know

647
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:13,191
I'm asking…

648
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,813
if all the way down,

649
00:39:16,436 --> 00:39:17,872
you want to bring it into the world

650
00:39:18,558 --> 00:39:19,450
I want it very much

651
00:39:19,788 --> 00:39:21,010
Or if an accident befalling

652
00:39:21,377 --> 00:39:22,833
or fate intervening or

653
00:39:24,337 --> 00:39:25,750
however you want to fucking put it,

654
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:28,602
might find a small part of you relieved

655
00:39:31,256 --> 00:39:32,412
I want my baby

656
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:33,932
Then you're gonna lay down

657
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:34,670
and be spoiled

658
00:39:35,908 --> 00:39:37,840
and put off proving what else you can do

659
00:39:37,987 --> 00:39:40,232
until after you've popped out this kid

660
00:39:52,527 --> 00:39:53,752
"Voters of the camp,

661
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:56,852
do you see come before you

662
00:39:57,568 --> 00:39:59,952
some swollen and dissolute stranger?

663
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:02,391
Do not mistake

664
00:40:04,225 --> 00:40:06,783
It is I, E.B. Farnum!"

665
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:08,202
Lie back, E.B

666
00:40:08,525 --> 00:40:09,871
"Beaten past recognition by

667
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:11,792
a candidate for another office

668
00:40:12,128 --> 00:40:14,971
Lie the fuck back

669
00:40:17,056 --> 00:40:17,592
and listen

670
00:40:19,725 --> 00:40:21,793
I need your truthful reply

671
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:23,201
Lie, I will know it,

672
00:40:23,957 --> 00:40:25,833
and death will be no respite

673
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:27,370
I told Hearst nothing

674
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:29,570
of Bullock and the widow

675
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,332
I will profane your fucking remains, E.B

676
00:40:32,545 --> 00:40:33,482
Not my remains, Al

677
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,330
Gabriel's trumpet will produce you

678
00:40:35,407 --> 00:40:36,733
from the ass of a pig

679
00:40:38,288 --> 00:40:39,483
You told me not to tell him,

680
00:40:39,948 --> 00:40:40,592
and I didn't

681
00:40:44,886 --> 00:40:45,771
I believe you

682
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:47,000
My pain is such

683
00:40:47,597 --> 00:40:48,643
that gives me no solace

684
00:40:48,936 --> 00:40:51,220
Well, try not to blame Bullock for presuming it was you,

685
00:40:51,508 --> 00:40:52,620
considering your fucking history

686
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:54,560
Anyways,

687
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:56,543
tonight's speeches are fucking canceled

688
00:40:56,607 --> 00:40:57,952
Nurse your fuckin' wouds

689
00:40:58,096 --> 00:40:58,880
Thank you

690
00:40:59,187 --> 00:41:00,093
I do not mean here

691
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:01,453
All right

692
00:41:02,156 --> 00:41:03,372
Let me collect myself

693
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,930
Cock...suckers !!!

694
00:41:34,766 --> 00:41:36,352
Say what you have to say…

695
00:41:38,758 --> 00:41:39,853
Again for Merrick, Dan

696
00:41:40,488 --> 00:41:40,960
Gratis

697
00:41:41,438 --> 00:41:43,492
Uh, I'm due no special thanks, Al

698
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:46,002
Facilitating presentation of the candidates

699
00:41:46,346 --> 00:41:48,132
 is the honor and privilege of the press

700
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:49,970
That's off, the presentation

701
00:41:50,626 --> 00:41:52,190
Is Farnum incapable of speech?

702
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:54,643
Does Star refuse to take advantage?

703
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:56,021
Other factors at play

704
00:41:56,487 --> 00:41:59,513
But surely Bullock and Harry Manning still can take to the hustings

705
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:00,871
I got to notify the parties

706
00:42:01,206 --> 00:42:02,602
I'm an interested party too, Al

707
00:42:03,036 --> 00:42:04,572
And I require explanation

708
00:42:04,896 --> 00:42:05,492
Jesus Christ

709
00:42:05,737 --> 00:42:06,662
How interested are you?

710
00:42:07,006 --> 00:42:09,711
Enough to bleed to keep the business from being a fucking puppet show?

711
00:42:10,788 --> 00:42:11,990
I can imagine bleeding,

712
00:42:12,347 --> 00:42:14,151
if first I've been made to understand

713
00:42:14,557 --> 00:42:16,620
No one asked if you could imagine bleeding,

714
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:19,113
or if you'd have tumbling or somersaults or cartwheels

715
00:42:19,157 --> 00:42:20,331
to bring you into the lists

716
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:22,402
Drink and fuck on the house, 

717
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:23,770
but do not attempt to detain me

718
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:41,693
In what state?

719
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:46,243
We ain't in a state, Shaunessy

720
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:47,632
What condition?

721
00:42:48,015 --> 00:42:48,662
The room? 

722
00:42:49,326 --> 00:42:49,922
How much 

723
00:42:50,196 --> 00:42:50,832
disarray?

724
00:42:51,105 --> 00:42:51,753
No fucking... 

725
00:42:51,997 --> 00:42:52,600
disarray

726
00:42:53,397 --> 00:42:55,611
But you nearly had brain on your walls

727
00:42:56,415 --> 00:42:57,651
Oooh!

728
00:43:05,176 --> 00:43:06,200
You see me empty, Sir,

729
00:43:06,478 --> 00:43:07,840
do not pause and inquire, 

730
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:09,432
simply assume 

731
00:43:10,018 --> 00:43:10,810
and refill

732
00:43:14,365 --> 00:43:14,880
Would you 

733
00:43:15,317 --> 00:43:16,463
rather we spoke in private?

734
00:43:17,168 --> 00:43:17,971
No, fuck, no

735
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:19,362
I'd rather the gentleman stay

736
00:43:19,866 --> 00:43:20,302
Captain Turner

737
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:22,140
I'd rather the Captain stay

738
00:43:22,617 --> 00:43:24,953
Brings home I consort with my betters

739
00:43:27,225 --> 00:43:28,413
I'll not dissemble, Sir

740
00:43:29,098 --> 00:43:30,612
Today's events have gave me pause

741
00:43:31,328 --> 00:43:32,081
Hmm

742
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:34,432
Tell me what you mean

743
00:43:34,687 --> 00:43:36,083
The beating of Farnum most recently

744
00:43:36,548 --> 00:43:37,612
How is Mr. Farnum?

745
00:43:37,745 --> 00:43:38,481
Worse for wear,

746
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:39,490
not that I'd care 

747
00:43:39,797 --> 00:43:40,470
if he weren't in your hire

748
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:42,253
Where does the Sheriff get off 

749
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:43,983
taking off on one of your own?

750
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:47,142
I don't consider Bullock came here to beat Farnum. 

751
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:48,901
He and I had appointed to meet

752
00:43:49,157 --> 00:43:50,130
In my joint this morning,

753
00:43:50,376 --> 00:43:52,782
another of your workers was gut-shot, Mr. Hearst

754
00:43:53,138 --> 00:43:53,730
Yes, I know

755
00:43:54,008 --> 00:43:55,862
Now this wasn't some hooplehead bullshit

756
00:43:56,168 --> 00:43:58,162
This had the feel of a put-up job

757
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:00,213
I fear a plot against you

758
00:44:01,267 --> 00:44:03,852
I have learned to accept, Mr. Swearengen,

759
00:44:03,946 --> 00:44:06,980
that events sharing some effect on my interests

760
00:44:07,225 --> 00:44:09,171
does not make them part of a plot

761
00:44:09,307 --> 00:44:10,273
You ain't the center of the universe,

762
00:44:10,306 --> 00:44:11,410
in other words

763
00:44:11,686 --> 00:44:12,120
Exactly

764
00:44:13,295 --> 00:44:14,501
Don't that lead you to despair?

765
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:16,732
No, Sir

766
00:44:16,497 --> 00:44:18,611
You're stronger-minded than I

767
00:44:19,077 --> 00:44:19,563
Bullock 

768
00:44:19,917 --> 00:44:22,662
beating Farnum seems more likely some

769
00:44:22,678 --> 00:44:25,670
expression of a private feeling of his own

770
00:44:25,918 --> 00:44:27,730
That leaves the bloodshed in my bar, 

771
00:44:28,288 --> 00:44:28,713
Sir

772
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:30,600
How do you account for that?

773
00:44:30,855 --> 00:44:34,033
Nor are the Cornish well-loved as a race

774
00:44:34,637 --> 00:44:36,162
Oh, not you through the Cornish

775
00:44:36,437 --> 00:44:38,721
Maybe the Cornish themselves were the object of the violence

776
00:44:38,947 --> 00:44:40,091
Well, they do tend to 

777
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:42,783
aggregate and organize to

778
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:46,240
further their financial interests

779
00:44:46,566 --> 00:44:47,401
Unions

780
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:49,970
Have you strong feeling on that subject?

781
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:52,022
I don't give a fuck about unions, Mr. Hearst

782
00:44:52,445 --> 00:44:55,823
Nor do I have any objection to the killing of the Cornish as high-graders

783
00:44:56,275 --> 00:44:58,613
aggregating organizing cocksuckers. But 

784
00:44:59,006 --> 00:45:00,521
bloodletting on my premises 

785
00:45:01,177 --> 00:45:01,800
that I ain't approved 

786
00:45:02,426 --> 00:45:04,291
I take as a fucking affront

787
00:45:04,616 --> 00:45:05,452
It puts me off 

788
00:45:06,066 --> 00:45:06,830
my feed

789
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:11,163
How do we know when 

790
00:45:11,687 --> 00:45:13,230
you are off your feed?

791
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:15,401
You'll start to see me tearing things down

792
00:45:16,697 --> 00:45:18,190
Speeches tonight are canceled

793
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,233
Unless the insult's cured by tomorrow, 

794
00:45:22,115 --> 00:45:23,603
there'll be further tearing down

795
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:25,010
Fuck the fucking elections,

796
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,672
and fuck the agreement with Yankton

797
00:45:27,096 --> 00:45:29,442
Let the camp return to its former repute : 

798
00:45:29,926 --> 00:45:31,840
unstable and unsafe for commerce

799
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:33,770
I'm a great believer in those

800
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:35,331
Oh, stability, Sir, and commerce?

801
00:45:35,638 --> 00:45:36,611
I can fucking imagine

802
00:45:36,848 --> 00:45:38,101
Think of all they've helped you accomplish

803
00:45:38,888 --> 00:45:40,213
Shall I perceive you then

804
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:42,383
as dangerous to my interests?

805
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,191
As capable of inconvenience and   

806
00:45:45,248 --> 00:45:47,652
of some damage and debt to those that would

807
00:45:47,868 --> 00:45:49,473
act against my interests, 

808
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,713
I cannot fucking argue with dangerous

809
00:45:52,518 --> 00:45:53,800
Different from powerful though,

810
00:45:54,345 --> 00:45:56,882
which speaks to potency longer term

811
00:45:57,146 --> 00:45:59,661
I'd not have myself called powerful in your company 

812
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,080
or the Captain's

813
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:04,002
Then I'll hope that your insult is cured 

814
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:06,963
to spare the camp any danger

815
00:46:08,728 --> 00:46:10,521
of however brief a duration

816
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:15,662
And to look for one fucking instant out of the other end of the telescope

817
00:46:16,878 --> 00:46:17,183
once placated…

818
00:46:21,117 --> 00:46:22,080
I'm meek as a babe

819
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:28,281
Dead

820
00:46:38,268 --> 00:46:39,802
You will want to converse with 

821
00:46:40,586 --> 00:46:42,531
those friends of yours, Captain Turner,

822
00:46:42,826 --> 00:46:44,260
who argues with the Cornish

823
00:46:46,705 --> 00:46:48,883
Perhaps they'd care to pay another visit to the saloon

824
00:46:51,805 --> 00:46:53,202
I think I'll want to hear the talk

825
00:46:56,537 --> 00:46:57,580
Fucking pagan

826
00:46:58,465 --> 00:47:00,331
Tell your God to ready for blood

827
00:47:21,657 --> 00:47:23,651
Would you rather I didn't introduce you from the audience? 

828
00:47:25,037 --> 00:47:26,340
Is it all so hard to remember?

829
00:47:27,416 --> 00:47:27,821
No, I, 

830
00:47:28,218 --> 00:47:28,842
uh,I think I got it

831
00:47:31,636 --> 00:47:32,751
Unless you don't wanna

832
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:37,001
Ought we to start soon for the hustings?

833
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:38,111
Five minutes

834
00:47:45,845 --> 00:47:47,472
Adams may default on that house

835
00:47:48,056 --> 00:47:49,752
Asks me to assume his note

836
00:47:51,207 --> 00:47:52,801
That's a very pleasant house

837
00:47:54,347 --> 00:47:55,203
Uh, I-I'd…

838
00:47:56,216 --> 00:47:58,312
never thought of myself as a homeowner

839
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:00,262
It's very very spacious

840
00:48:02,695 --> 00:48:04,153
It's Albert Swearengen

841
00:48:12,618 --> 00:48:13,412
The speeches

842
00:48:13,926 --> 00:48:14,673
are postponed

843
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:18,410
Is Farnum turned for the worse?

844
00:48:21,886 --> 00:48:23,561
I'd borrow the Sheriff a moment

845
00:48:33,816 --> 00:48:34,523
Evening, Jane

846
00:48:35,617 --> 00:48:37,352
Mrs. Bullock asks me to

847
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,410
author with her to give the children 

848
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:42,053
an account of my scouting for Custer

849
00:48:43,207 --> 00:48:45,501
I think I'd like to hear that story myself

850
00:48:47,998 --> 00:48:49,431
"Custer was a cunt. 

851
00:48:50,126 --> 00:48:50,761
The end."

852
00:48:52,865 --> 00:48:53,600
Yo,

853
00:48:54,297 --> 00:48:55,221
a piss puddle

854
00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:58,091
Must not have seen that 

855
00:48:58,417 --> 00:48:59,543
when seating myself

856
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:02,742
Why are you drinking so much?

857
00:49:03,745 --> 00:49:05,340
I drink what I'm able

858
00:49:06,006 --> 00:49:07,113
If that comes to much

859
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:10,542
That's the day's affair and the liquor's

860
00:49:13,756 --> 00:49:15,990
You returning to the Bella Union?

861
00:49:16,807 --> 00:49:17,772
Not tonight

862
00:49:18,086 --> 00:49:19,572
As residence and workplace 

863
00:49:20,837 --> 00:49:21,780
is my meaning

864
00:49:23,475 --> 00:49:24,843
Thos girls need looking out for

865
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:26,720
And who will look out for you 

866
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:30,460
against that gut-stabbed cocksucker,

867
00:49:30,697 --> 00:49:31,531
weaving schemes 

868
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,992
from his coming to Jesus?

869
00:49:34,588 --> 00:49:35,320
I don't know

870
00:49:36,635 --> 00:49:40,073
Why is everybody fucking whispering all of a sudden?

871
00:49:41,068 --> 00:49:42,301
I said I don't know

872
00:49:45,617 --> 00:49:46,643
Do you mind…

873
00:49:48,336 --> 00:49:49,791
if I stay here tonight?

874
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:51,880
I'd be glad if you would

875
00:49:53,826 --> 00:49:56,302
I don't know why you started sleeping outside anyway

876
00:50:07,968 --> 00:50:12,161
Every day takes figuring out all over again how to fucking live

877
00:50:19,426 --> 00:50:20,251
Night, Jane

878
00:50:22,095 --> 00:50:22,570
Yep

879
00:50:31,785 --> 00:50:33,561
Pain-in-the-balls Hearst

880
00:50:34,045 --> 00:50:35,521
Running his holdings like a despot,

881
00:50:35,787 --> 00:50:36,993
I grant, has a fucking logic

882
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:40,560
It's the way I fucking run mine. It's the way I'd run my home if I fucking had one

883
00:50:41,636 --> 00:50:44,543
But there's no practical need for him to run the fucking camp

884
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:45,463
That's out of scale

885
00:50:46,147 --> 00:50:46,861
It's out of proportion,

886
00:50:47,557 --> 00:50:51,463
and it's a warped unnatural impulse, this fucking cocksucker!

887
00:50:52,128 --> 00:50:52,802
Sorry

888
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:56,692
Shall I go back down with you?

889
00:50:58,365 --> 00:50:59,721
It won't be just now

890
00:51:00,116 --> 00:51:02,352
He'll be wanting to marshal his cutthroats

891
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:13,440
Do stay in hailing distance

892
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:17,440
