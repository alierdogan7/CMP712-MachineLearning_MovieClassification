152
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,219
MOSTLY THEY SAY,
"THIRTY DAYS. "

153
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:24,724
MY FRIEND, YOU MAY PAINT
A SHAVING MUG WITH THE NAME
"JUDGE BUCKNER"...

154
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,227
AND COUNT UPON ME
AS A STEADY PATRON
NOW THAT YOU'RE ESTABLISHED.

155
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:32,231
TWO BITS.
OH, TUT, TUT, TUT.
I SHALL SETTLE WITH YOU WEEKLY.

156
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,233
OR, PERHAPS, MONTHLY.

157
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,736
YOU'LL SUM UP MY ACCOUNT--
I BEG YOUR PARDON, MADAM.

158
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,239
HE'S AN EXCELLENT SHAVE, MADAM.
OH, I'M SORRY, MADAM.
GOOD MORNING, MA'AM.

159
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,743
I WISH TO HAVE
A TOOTH PULLED.
YES, MA'AM.
WILL YOU BE SEATED, PLEASE?

160
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,247
THERE YA ARE.
WHAT'S THIS?

161
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:52,251
IMBIBE, MADAM, OR SUFFER.
I DO NOT IMBIBE.

162
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:56,756
VERY WELL, MA'AM.
NOW, IF YOU'LL KINDLY PLACE YOUR
RIGHT KNEE AGAINST MY CHEST.

163
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,259
WHY, I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING IN MY LIFE.
I'LL TELL MY HUSBAND.

164
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,262
JUST FOR LEVERAGE, MA'AM.
JUST FOR LEVERAGE.
[ Screams ]

165
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,766
SAY "AH. "
THERE WE ARE.
AH!

166
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,768
I TAKE A SHORT TRIP
OUT OF TOWN,
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS.

167
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,771
FOUR KILLINGS IN A WEEK.
IT'S GOT TO STOP.

168
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,773
FOUR?
DID YOU SAY FOUR?

169
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:17,276
THAT'S RIGHT, FOUR!
WELL, WE'RE GETTING TO BE
QUITE A TOWN, AREN'T WE?

170
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,279
I DOUBT IF THEY HAVE
THAT MANY IN DODGE CITY.
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

171
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,282
WE AIM TO COMPETE
WITH ANY CITY IN SIZE,
BUT NOT IN LAWLESSNESS.

172
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,285
CERTAINLY, OF COURSE,
FOUR KILLINGS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

173
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,288
THE JUDGE WAS SAYING,
MR. McCLOUD, BEFORE YOU CAME,

174
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,791
THAT THE APPOINTMENT
OF A MARSHAL IS OBVIOUSLY
IN ORDER.

175
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:37,296
IF I CAN FIND THE RIGHT MAN.
I HAVE A NEPHEW. HE'S A FINE,
UPSTANDING YOUNG MAN WHO--

176
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,298
WHO YOU'D LIKE TO SEE
ON THE CITY PAYROLL.

177
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,801
WELL, THE MAN WE NEED
MUST BE HONEST,

178
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,304
MUST HAVE COURAGE,
KNOW HOW TO HANDLE MEN.

179
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,807
HAVE YOU ANY SUGGESTIONS?
WAIT NOW,
THERE'S MY NEPHEW.

180
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,309
HE'S OUT!
WE REALLY FELT, MR. McCLOUD,

181
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,813
THAT YOU'D PROBABLY MAKE
A NOMINATION.

182
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,766
GENTLEMEN, I THINK I KNOW
THE VERY MAN.

183
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,819
LOOK OUT FOR THE RUTS, WILL.
"LOOK OUT FOR THE RUTS. "

184
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,821
THERE YOU HAVE
THE STORY OF MY LIFE.

185
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,824
ONLY I NEVER DID LOOK OUT.
ALWAYS BEEN IN ONE.

186
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,326
LOOK AT ME NOW--
A SCHOOLTEACHER.

187
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:10,329
WHERE'S THAT GOING
TO GET ME?
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

188
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,333
I THINK I COULD GO
CLEAR TO THE TOP IF I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE THERE WAITING.

189
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,837
WHY NOT GO TO THE TOP
ANYWAY, JUST FOR THE CLIMB
AND THE VIEW?

190
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,840
- [ Chattering ]
- ALL RIGHT.

191
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,842
I'M FROM TENNESSEE.
WHAT OF IT?

192
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,845
WE AIN'T WANTIN' PEOPLE
AROUND HERE
WHO SELL THEIR VOTES.

193
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:29,849
I DON'T HAVE TO SELL MINE.
I GOT A BUSINESS OF MY OWN.
SMART ALECK, HUH?

194
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:32,852
WHAT DO YOU SAY, BOYS,
WE GIVE HIM A LIFT OUT OF TOWN?

195
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,354
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM.

196
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,859
WHO MIGHT YOU BE?

197
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,862
NOTHIN' TO YOU. I JUST SAID,
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF.

198
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:46,365
YOU TALK MIGHTY BIG FOR ONE MAN.
WHAT RIGHT DO YOU GOT
TO BUTT INTO THIS?

199
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,367
I'LL TELL YA,
YA PACK OF COYOTES.

200
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:51,871
A MAN BORN IN THIS COUNTRY
IS AN AMERICAN.
DON'T FORGET THAT.

201
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,323
IT'S HIS RIGHT TO...

202
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:58,878
GO WHERE HE PLEASES,
AND IT'S MY BUSINESS TO--

203
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:01,330
COME ON, MARY.

204
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,887
HIT HIM IN THE TEETH, BOB,
IN THE TEETH.

205
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,892
LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND, MISTER.
THANKS. WHERE'D YOU
COME FROM?

206
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,896
- BEEN FOLLOWIN' YOU
AROUND ALL MORNIN'.
- WHAT FOR?

207
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:20,900
YOU'RE A COWBOY,
AIN'T YA?
YEP. FROM TEXAS. WHY?

208
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,241
AH!

209
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:33,746
SURE, THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.
THEM DOGGIES ARE THE BOLDEST
I EVER RODE HERD ON.

210
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:37,249
IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES
OUT ON THE RANGE AFTER YOU GOT
THE HERD BEDDED DOWN--

211
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,753
[ Man Groaning ]
THAT'S MY TONGUE.
MY MISTAKE.

212
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,255
EVER HAD
YOUR TOOTH PULLED?
NO, ALL GOOD.

213
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:47,259
YOU'RE LUCKY.
SAY, YOU REALLY BUSTED
THAT KNUCKLE, DIDN'T YA?

214
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,764
OH, IT AIN'T NOTHIN'.
NO, I'VE HAD LOTS OF 'EM.
HERE'S WHAT I ALWAYS USE.

215
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:55,267
THANKS,
BUT YOU AIN'T TOLD ME
IF I'D GO OUT ON THE RANGE,

216
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,269
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING
THEY'RE GONNA ASK ME?

217
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,271
FOR CHEWIN' TOBACCO,
MOST LIKELY.

218
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,774
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANTED TO ASK YOU.
ME?

219
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,277
YEAH. YOU KNOW THAT GIRL
I WAS STARING AT
WHEN ALL THE RUCKUS STARTED--

220
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,279
YEAH.
WELL, WHO IS SHE?

221
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:10,783
WELL, HER NAME IS
MARY McCLOUD. WHY?

222
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:15,788
WELL, I'LL TELL YA.
I THINK MAYBE I'LL MARRY HER.
WHAT?

223
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,290
OF COURSE, IF SHE'LL HAVE ME.
I MEAN,

224
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,793
A FELLA WOULDN'T WANT TO MARRY
ANYONE THAT DIDN'T WANT HIM,
NATURALLY.

225
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,296
OH, NATURALLY.
YOU KNOW HER WELL?

226
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,799
NO, JUST SEEN HER
ONCE OR TWICE.

227
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,803
ONCE SHE WAS ON A HORSE.
THE NEXT TIME
SHE WAS WITH A JACKASS.

228
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,806
HE IS, HUH?
MAKES IT EASIER, DON'T IT?

229
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,810
PRACTICALLY A CINCH.
YOU DO THINGS KINDA
SUDDEN, DON'T YA?

230
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,812
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

231
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,314
BUT, YOU SEE, I GOT HER
FIGURED OUT THIS WAY.

232
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,317
IF YOU LIKE SOMEONE
AND YOU DON'T TELL 'EM
RIGHT OFF,

233
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:49,321
WHY, MAYBE ALL THAT TIME
YOU WASTED, SHE LIKED YOU, TOO,

234
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,323
SO, WELL, ALL THAT
TIME'S WASTED, AIN'T IT?

235
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:55,828
IT IS, THE WAY YOU PUT IT.
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO GO ABOUT THIS?

236
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,332
OH, YES.
GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT.

237
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,837
UH, I FIGURED THAT
IF YOU WAS TO TAKE ME
OVER TO HER...

238
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:10,843
AND GIVE ME AN INTRODUCE, THEN
I COULD TELL HER WHO I WAS AND
THAT I NEVER MURDERED NOBODY,

239
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,346
AND YOU COULD GO SOMEWHERE
AND SIT ON A FENCE
TILL I WAS THROUGH.

240
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,851
I'M SURE YOU WON'T BE LONG.
WELL, COME ON, I THINK
SHE'S OVER AT THE BANK.

241
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:22,354
I FORGOT TO ASK YOU
YOUR NAME.
FLETCH.

242
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,858
MINE'S SETON. BOB SETON.
YOU GOT A FIRST NAME?

243
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,860
YEAH. CUPID.

244
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,368
HE'S A REAL COWBOY.
FROM TEXAS.

245
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,370
THIS IS HER FATHER'S BANK.

246
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,874
OWNS A BANK, HUH?
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

247
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,376
HE DON'T LIKE COWBOYS EITHER.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

248
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,379
YEAH, I KNOW THE BREED--
STRING-HOLLERED AND SPAVINED.

249
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,381
SQUEEZE THE BLOOD
OUT OF A TURNIP.

250
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,884
KEEP YOUR CHIN
TO YOURSELF.
HUH?

251
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,387
I MEAN, YOU WAIT HERE,
AND I'LL GO BRING HER.
FAIR ENOUGH.

252
00:15:55,721 --> 00:16:00,392
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS
MY APPRECIATION, MR. McCLOUD.

253
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,394
I SUPPOSE IT WILL BE LEFT
TO A VOTE, HUH?

254
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:06,398
NATURALLY. THERE WILL BE
OTHER CANDIDATES THROWING
THEIR HATS IN THE RING,

255
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,901
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE
ANY TROUBLE WINNIN'.

256
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,903
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

257
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,907
FLETCH,
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
WHERE ARE YOU DRAGGING ME?

258
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,909
FRIEND OF MINE HERE
WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.
[ Squeals ]

259
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,914
YOU, UH, WANTED
TO TALK TO ME?

260
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:25,918
UH, YES,
THAT'S SORT OF THE IDEA.

261
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,420
WELL--
UH--

262
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,924
DID THE SQUIRT TELL YOU
WHO I WAS?
WHO?

263
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,427
THE KID, CUPID.
AIN'T THAT A NAME FOR YOU?

264
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,931
[ Chuckles ]
YOU KNOW, HIM THAT WENT IN
AND ASKED FOR YOU.

265
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,934
MY BROTHER, YOU MEAN.
YEAH. HE AND I--

266
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:45,437
YOUR WHAT?
MY BROTHER. WHO DID YOU
THINK HE WAS?

267
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:50,442
WELL--
YOUR BROTHER.
YES.

268
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,945
YOU SEE THE FIGHT?
NO.

269
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,447
WE LOST... ALMOST.

270
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,449
WAS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

271
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:01,453
WELL, NOT EXACTLY.
THAT IS-- NO.

272
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,455
THEN WHAT WAS IT?

273
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:07,459
WELL, UH, DID HE
SAY ANYTHING TO YOU...

274
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,963
ABOUT ANYTHING
I'D SAID TO HIM?
MY BROTHER, YOU MEAN?

275
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,464
YES.
NO.

276
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,466
HE DIDN'T?
NO.

277
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,469
WELL--

278
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,973
BACK THERE IN THE OFFICE,
I HAD THIS ALL FIGURED OUT.

279
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,977
OUT THERE ON THE PRAIRIE,
IT SEEMED EASY.
YOU GOT BLUE EYES.

280
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,480
I BEG YOUR PARDON.
YES, SIR, BLUE EYES.

281
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,482
OH, LET'S SEE NOW.
WHERE WAS I?

282
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:33,986
BOB SETON,
FROM TEXAS.

283
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,489
MA DIED WHEN I WAS
NINE YEARS OLD,
AND ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS AGO--

284
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,992
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY,
MR. McCLOUD.

285
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:43,495
AND, ONCE AGAIN,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD LUCK TO YA.

286
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,500
WHERE'S MARY?
SHE WENT ACROSS THE STREET
TO BUY A SPOOL OF THREAD.

287
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,503
OH, WELL, I'LL GO--
I WOULDN'T DO THAT,
IF I WAS YOU, MR. CANTRELL.

288
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:55,507
SHE ALWAYS GETS A LITTLE FIDGETY
WHEN SHE'S BUYING
A SPOOL OF THREAD OR SOMETHING.

289
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:59,011
DAD, YOU TELL HIM ABOUT ME
GOIN' TO BE A COWBOY.
GO AHEAD AND TELL HIM.

290
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:03,015
THAT'S THE ONLY TIME
I WAS EVER IN JAIL, AND IT WAS
THE OTHER FELLA'S FAULT.

291
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:07,019
I WAS DRUNK.
DRINKING, OF COURSE,
CONSTITUTING NO CRIME.

292
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:11,523
MA'AM?
I SAID, DRINKING, OF COURSE,
CONSTITUTING NO CRIME.

293
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,526
I'M GONNA LEARN BIG WORDS
MYSELF SOMEDAY.

294
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:19,031
NOW LOOK, I'VE LISTENED TO YOU
VERY PATIENTLY. I'VE HEARD
YOU WHOLE LIFE'S HISTORY.

295
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:22,034
I KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR CATTLE
WHO'VE EATEN TOO MANY
LOCO WEEDS,

296
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,536
WHY SULPHUR IN MOLASSES
ISN'T AS GOOD AS PEOPLE
THINK IT IS...

297
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,538
AND A THOUSAND OTHER THINGS
THAT I'VE FORGOTTEN ALREADY.

298
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,042
NOW WILL YOU PLEASE GET
TO THE POINT AND TELL ME
WHAT YOU WANT?

299
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,045
I WANT TO MARRY YOU.
YOU WHAT?

300
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,548
