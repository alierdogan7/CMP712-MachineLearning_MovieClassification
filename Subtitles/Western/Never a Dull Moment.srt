1
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,067
NEXT BULLDOGGER
IS CYCLONE PETE JONES.

2
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,067
NEXT CONTESTANT,
CHRIS HAYWARD.

3
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,400
MY WORD! SPECTACULAR, ISN'T IT?

4
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:47,901
COMING OUT OF
THE CHUTES NOW, SLIM WILLIAMS.

5
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,067
IT LOOKS PRETTY SILLY TO ME-

6
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,701
WRESTLING
WITH COWS.

7
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:56,501
WHY DON'T THEY
WRESTLE MEN?

8
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:58,133
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

9
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,467
WHAT PURPOSE CAN IT
POSSIBLY SERVE?

10
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:06,067
THAT'S HOW THEY GET
THOSE POUNDED STEAKS.

11
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,400
YOU DON'T SAY!

12
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,434
THAT CONCLUDES
THE BULLDOGGING CONTEST.

13
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:13,067
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

14
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,868
WHILE THEY'RE PREPARING
FOR THE NEXT EVENT,

15
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:18,334
I'D LIKE TO
INTRODUCE TO YOU

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,767
THE LADY WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS BENEFIT,

17
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,801
MISS KAY KINGSLEY.

18
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:32,100
MOST OF YOU KNOW
MISS KINGSLEY,

19
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:34,100
BUT FOR ANYONE WHO HAPPENS
TO HAVE BEEN LOCKED UP

20
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,100
IN A DARK CLOSET
FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS,

21
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:38,567
SHE'S WRITTEN A LOT
OF SUCCESSFUL SONGS-

22
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:40,334
SOME OF THE TOP
BROADWAY MUSICALS.

23
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:45,834
OH. SHE'S ASKED ME TO REMIND
YOU THAT I COLLABORATED WITH HER,

24
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:49,634
SO I WILL, BUT I DON'T
NEED TO BE REMINDED

25
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:54,767
BECAUSE SHE'S EVERYTHING
THAT ANY MAN COULD HOPE FOR

26
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,968
AND NOW, WHILE THE COLLECTION
BOXES ARE BEING PASSED,

27
00:02:57,033 --> 00:03:00,200
KAY IS GOING TO SING
ONE OF OUR LATEST SONGS.

28
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:12,367
FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK
ALL THE COWBOYS WHO CAME OVER HERE

29
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:15,834
FROM MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
TO PUT ON THIS TERRIFIC SHOW.

30
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:18,834
LET'S GIVE THEM
A REAL BIG HAND.

31
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:25,534
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

32
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,667
THESE RODEOS WILL BE
HOLDING KNITTING CONTESTS.

33
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:29,133
YEAH.

34
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,000
* ONCE YOU FIND
YOUR GUY *

35
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:46,734
* YOU'LL KNOW THE WORDS
TO ALL THE LOVE SONGS ARE TRUE *

36
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:51,567
* AND ONCE YOU FIND
YOUR GUY *

37
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:58,400
* IT WOULDN'T MATTER
IF THE EARTH SPLIT IN TWO *

38
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:03,801
* THOSE LONELY DAYS
YOU DREADED *

39
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:09,400
* WILL VANISH
FROM YOUR SIGHT *

40
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:19,767
* THE FUTURE THAT WAS DARK
LOOKS BRIGHT *

41
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,701
* SO ONCE YOU FIND
YOUR GUY *

42
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:33,667
* THE ONE AND ONLY
WHO IS RIGHT FROM THE START *

43
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:38,300
* DON'T WAIT
TILL IT'S TOO LATE *

44
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:44,934
* BUT LET HIM KNOW THAT HE
IS FIRST IN YOUR HEART... *

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,901
MAN, ORVIE, THERE'S A
GAL I COULD REALLY GO FOR.

46
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:50,901
YOU COULD?
WELL, LET'S GO OVER.

47
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,701
MAYBE SHE'S GOT
A FRIEND.

48
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:53,667
SHH.

49
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:57,133
*... WHEN LOVE
IS PASSING BY *

50
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,701
* LIFE STARTS *

51
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:18,834
* THE DAY YOU FIND
YOUR GUY *

52
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:27,033
I'M TELLING YOU, ORVIE,
THERE'S A WOMAN.

53
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,033
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME?

54
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,901
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL HER?

55
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:32,200
YOU MEAN-AHH!

56
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:34,234
SURE WOULD LIKE
TO MEET HER, THOUGH.

57
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,067
DON'T SET PERCHED UP
THERE LIKE AN OLD BARN OWL.

58
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:39,567
JUST WALK UP AND INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

59
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:41,567
THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS
DONE, AND IT NEVER MISSED.

60
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,400
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
WITH A CITY WOMAN.

61
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:46,033
THE HECK YOU CAN'T. I
DONE IT WITH A CITY WOMAN.

62
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:49,067
MET ELLIE MAE, MY SECOND
WIFE, IN WALLA WALLA,

63
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,100
RIGHT ON
THE MAIN STREET.

64
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:54,534
HAPPIEST 3 MONTHS OF MY
LIFE WAS WITH ELLIE MAE.

65
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,033
THIS GAL'S
NO RANCH WOMAN.

66
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,033
OH, RANCH WOMAN,
CITY WOMAN!

67
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,033
PUT THEM IN
A MOTHER HUBBARD

68
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,701
AND ON THE LONG END OF A
CHURN, AND THEY'RE ALL ALIKE.

69
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:06,033
Announcer: BUCKING HORSE RIDERS,
PLEASE REPORT TO THE CHUTES.

70
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,667
YES, SIR, NOW, SHE
LOOKS STOUT AND HEALTHY.

71
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:12,033
AND IF YOU ASK ME, CHRIS,
SHE'D MAKE YOU A FINE WIFE

72
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,167
AND TAKE MIGHTY GOOD CARE
OF THEM KIDS OF YOURS, TOO.

73
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:19,033
HEY, YOU WANT ME TO GO ON
OVER THERE AND TELL HER?

74
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,534
NO, I DON'T!

75
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:23,167
OH, BUT, CHRIS,
YOU DO NEED A WIFE.

76
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:26,634
UH-HUH.

77
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:31,133
WILL ALL BUCKING HORSE
RIDERS PLEASE REPORT TO THE CHUTES?

78
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,067
HOWDY, MA'AM.

79
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:35,033
OH, HOWDY!

80
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,501
WHAT CAN I
DO FOR YOU?

81
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,100
WELL, IT'S ME THAT'S
DOING THE DOING, MISS.

82
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,968
I GOT A T-OFF
FOR YOU.

83
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,534
REALLY?
WHAT IS IT?

84
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:47,567
WELL, I KNOW A FELLA THAT
THINKS YOU'RE PRETTY SALTY.

85
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:50,067
WELL, THAT'S
MIGHTY SWEET OF HIM.

86
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:51,567
ANYBODY I KNOW?

87
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:54,501
NO, BUT IT'S SOMEBODY YOU OUGHT TO KNOW.

88
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:58,033
HA HA! WELL, YOU TELL HIM
THANKS A MILLION,

89
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,534
AND TELL HIM I THINK
HE'S SALTED, TOO.

90
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:00,534
YOU TETHERED?

91
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:02,000
AM I WHAT?

92
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:04,033
TETHERED.
HITCHED. MARRIED.

93
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,200
NO.

94
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,534
WELL, GOOD, BECAUSE
HE'S LOOKING FOR A WOMAN,

95
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:10,901
AND IT'S TIME A GAL LIKE
YOU WAS LOOKING FOR A MAN.

96
00:07:10,968 --> 00:07:12,534
WELL...

97
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:14,701
SHE SURE IS LOOKING FOR A MAN, PARTNER.

98
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,701
WELL, GOOD,
AND I GOT HIM.

99
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:19,033
HE JUST AIN'T THE
KIND OF A COWPOKE

100
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,200
THAT COTTONS UP TO ANY OLD GAL, EITHER.

101
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:23,167
MATTER OF FACT IS,
YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE

102
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,567
HE'S ADMIRED SINCE
HE BURIED MARTHA.

103
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:27,968
WELL, I'M VERY
FLATTERED.

104
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,067
WELL,
YOU OUGHT TO BE.

105
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,567
HE'S A GOOD CATCH

106
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:33,868
AND THE BEST DAD-BURNED
COWHAND YOU'LL EVER SEE.

107
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:36,133
SURE SHE WANTS
TO MEET HIM, COWBOY.

108
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,634
BRING
THE CRITTER ON.

109
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:39,133
THAT'S A DEAL.

110
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,734
FIRST CONTESTANT,
CHRIS HAYWARD,

111
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:42,534
RIDING BUZZ BOMB.

112
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:44,167
ALL RIGHT, TURN HIM OUT OF HERE.

113
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:50,901
THAT'S HIM, MA'AM.

114
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:02,000
I WISH HE'D HOLD STILL
SO WE COULD SEE HIS FACE.

115
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:04,734
YOU'LL SEE IT
WHEN HE LANDS.

116
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:15,367
NEXT RIDER, LAREDO
"RED" HIGGINS FROM CARAMORE.

117
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,200
AHH!

118
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,234
SET ME DOWN, ORV.

119
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,534
WELL, HERE HE IS, NUMBER 7.

120
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:27,000
HE'S A NATURAL.

121
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:28,033
NICE RIDE.

122
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,367
OH, THANK YOU.

123
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:31,534
SET ME DOWN,
YOU KNOTHEAD.

124
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:34,133
HOW DO YOU MAKE THE HORSE JUMP THAT WAY?

125
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,734
YOU'D JUMP, TOO, LADY, IF YOU HAD
A HAIR ROPE TIED AROUND YOUR BELLY.

126
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:39,834
ANYWAY, THIS IS HIM.

127
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:41,834
MISS KINGSLEY,
MEET CHRIS HAYWARD.

128
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,067
GLAD TO KNOW
YOU, MA'AM.

129
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:45,033
HOW ABOUT YOU GALS
JOINING US AT SHORTIE'S

130
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,067
RIGHT AFTER
THE SHOW TONIGHT?

131
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:49,267
CHRIS WILL THROW A HAMBURGER
BUST FOR THE WHOLE BUNCH.

132
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:51,067
OH, ORV, THEY WOULDN'T
LIKE SHORTIE'S.

133
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,534
OH, THEY WOULD TOO.

134
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:55,434
SHORTIE PUTS MORE GOOP IN HIS
SANDWICHES THAN ANYBODY IN TOWN.

135
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,934
WELL, IT SOUNDS
WONDERFUL.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,234
I HAVE AN IDEA.

137
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,133
WHY DON'T YOU BRING NUMBER
7 UP TO MISS KINGSLEY'S?

138
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,801
SHE'D BE DELIGHTED.

139
00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:04,167
WOULDN'T YOU, KAY?

140
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:06,501
WELL, THAT WOULD
BE NICE, SOMETIME.

141
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:09,334
IT'S FIFTY FOUR
CENTRAL PARK WEST.

142
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,834
MAKE IT SOON!

143
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:12,834
WE WILL-MAYBE SOONER
THAN YOU THINK.

144
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:14,434
HERE COMES
DENVER DAN BAILEY.

145
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,868
I'M AWFULLY
SORRY, MA'AM.

146
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,400
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

147
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:49,767
I'M NOT
GOING TO RING IT.

148
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,567
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

149
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,567
ME EITHER.

150
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,567
I FEEL ABOUT
THE SAME WAY I DID

151
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:21,567
WHEN I BULLDOGGED
MY FIRST STEER.

152
00:11:21,634 --> 00:11:23,067
HMM. OH, MY LOVE,

153
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:25,100
YOU DO TURN
A NEAT COMPLIMENT.

154
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:28,601
I MEAN EXCITED AND PROUD
AND KIND OF HOLLOW INSIDE.

155
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,100
YOU KNOW HOW I MEAN.

156
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,100
SURE.
I FELT THE SAME WAY

157
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,100
WHEN I BULLDOGGED
MY FIRST STEER.

158
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:37,234
YOU SURE I DIDN'T SELL YOU
A BILL OF GOODS, BUCKSHOT?

159
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,734
YOU BET YOUR LIFE
YOU DID, NUMBER 7.

160
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:42,067
DIDN'T YOU SAY, "GET
YOUR HAIR IN A BRAID.

161
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,567
WE'RE HITCHING"?

162
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:45,567
HOW CAN A GAL HOLD OUT

163
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:47,601
AGAINST A LONG, TEDIOUS
ARGUMENT LIKE THAT-

164
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,434
ESPECIALLY FROM
A SPECTACULAR MUG

165
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,868
IN A RED SHIRT?

166
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:55,000
I HOPE IT WASN'T THAT FANCY
RODEO STUFF THAT TOOK YOU IN.

167
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:58,067
LIKE I SAID, THAT WAS JUST
TO GET ENOUGH MONEY TOGETHER

168
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,734
TO BUILD UP THE RANCH.

169
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,300
THE WAY THINGS
HAPPENED IN NEW YORK,

170
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:04,901
I GUESS I FORGOT I WAS JUST A COWPUNCH
WITH A COUPLE OF KIDS TO RAISE.

171
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:06,033
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO,

172
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,300
TALK ME OUT OF IT?

173
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:08,634
NO. I-

174
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:10,667
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO
BE DISAPPOINTED, THAT'S ALL.

175
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:13,567
WELL, I HAVEN'T BEEN
SO FAR.

176
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:16,534
DIDN'T YOU SAY THE SCENERY'S WONDERFUL
- MOUNTAINS AND STUFF?

177
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,534
YEAH. THAT'S A FACT.

178
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:21,501
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE CHILDREN, IS THERE?

179
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,567
SO HELP ME, BUCKSHOT, THEY'RE
THE FINEST LITTLE PAIR OF FILLIES

180
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:24,868
YOU EVER SAW
IN YOUR LIFE.

181
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:30,400
OH, CHRIS. PORGY.

182
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:31,601
OH, AGAIN?

183
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,934
UH-HUH.

184
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:40,100
PORGY'S NEVER SEEN
THIS MANY TREES BEFORE.

185
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:41,934
I MIGHT AS WELL
GET OUT

186
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,834
AND TAKE A LITTLE
STRETCH MYSELF.

187
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,601
CHRIS, YOU KNOW WHAT A GAL
WANTS MOST OUT OF LIFE-ANY GAL?

188
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:54,534
SHE WANTS TO BE
NECESSARY TO HER GUY-

189
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:56,734
NOT JUST ANY GUY,
BUT THE RIGHT GUY.

190
00:12:56,801 --> 00:13:01,534
HE'S GOT TO NEED HER TO SEW ON
HIS BUTTONS AND SCRUB HIS BACK

191
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:04,534
AND KID HIM OUT OF THOSE
MONDAY MORNING GLOOMS.

192
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:08,067
NOT THAT I'M AN OLD HAND
AT SUCH CHORES, BUT-

193
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:10,901
THIS IS IT, CHRIS.
I COULDN'T BE SURER.

194
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:13,667
YOU KNOW, BUCKSHOT, I WON'T
NEED TO BUY YOU A COW PONY

195
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,567
IF YOU CAN LOPE LIKE
THIS UNDER YOUR OWN STEAM.

196
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:17,801
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD A WORD I SAID.

197
00:13:17,868 --> 00:13:19,434
OH, THINK I DIDN'T?

198
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:22,033
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE
JUST PLAIN WACKY, MRS. HAYWARD,

199
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,033
AND I'M JUST
PLAIN LUCKY...

200
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,567
OR VICE VERSA.

201
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:26,934
HEY!

202
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:37,834
* I'M UP IN THE MORNING
AFORE DAYLIGHT *

203
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,167
* AFORE I SLEEP,
THE MOON SHINES BRIGHT *

204
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:42,300
* COME-A TI YI YIPPY
YIPPY YEA YIPPY YEA *

205
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,367
* COME-A TI YI YIPPY
YIPPY YEA *

206
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:45,834
* I GOT IN MY SADDLE... *

207
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:47,501
KAY, SEE THAT BARN
OVER THERE?

208
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:48,501
YEAH.

209
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:49,567
BELONGS
TO TUNK JOHNSON.

210
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:50,968
MEANS WE'RE
ALMOST HOME.

211
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:53,167
HOW FAR?

212
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:55,667
OH, JUST
A LITTLE WAYS NOW.

213
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,534
GOOD.

214
00:13:57,601 --> 00:14:00,534
HEY, YOU'RE NOT GOING
CHICKEN, ARE YOU?

215
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:03,534
WHO, ME?
WHY, I CAN HARDLY WAIT.

216
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,467
UH-OH.

217
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:11,334
WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW?

218
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,067
DO YOU HEAR
THAT CLANKING?

219
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:15,567
ISN'T IT THE DUCKS?

220
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:17,033
NO. DUCKS QUACK.

221
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,167
IT'S THE CON ROD
BEARING.

222
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:19,968
OH. WHAT DO THEY DO?

223
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,734
THEY CLANK.

224
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:24,567
I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE
BROUGHT ORVIE WITH US.

225
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:27,033
YES. THE 3 OF US
WOULD HAVE HAD SUCH FUN.

226
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,567
ORVIE COULD
HAVE FIXED IT.

227
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,067
HE CAN FIX ANYTHING.

228
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:32,033
NOT ONLY CAN,
BUT DID.

229
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,067
YOU KNOW HOW
TO DRIVE A CAR?

230
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:37,200
A CAR? YES.

231
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,501
MOVE OVER.
MOVE OVER, BOY.

232
00:14:58,601 --> 00:14:59,601
CHRIS!

233
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:00,667
YEAH?

234
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,667
YOU THINK THE KIDS
WILL SEE THROUGH ME?

235
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:06,033
WILL THEY CATCH ON THAT
I'M AS COUNTRY-WISE

236
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,400
AS A PARK AVENUE PIGEON?

237
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:09,634
YOU THINK
THEY'LL HATE ME FOR IT?

238
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,734
DON'T LET THEM SCARE YOU,
BUCKSHOT. THEY'RE GOOD KIDS.

239
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:30,267
SET THE BRAKE
TILL I CLOSE THE GATE.

240
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,234
NEVER MIND.
I'LL GET IT.

241
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,834
YOU THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE IT?

242
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:39,501
YOU THINK YOU'RE MARRIED TO
ONE OF THOSE HELPLESS FEMALES?

243
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:42,801
IF I CAN'T CLOSE
A GATE-OH!

244
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:44,734
WELL?

245
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:52,100
YOU THINK
YOU GOT ME, HUH?

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,934
VERY CLEVER.

247
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,767
WISE GUY.

248
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:18,067
SO YOU GOT BACK,
DID YOU?

249
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:19,934
HOWDY, MR. MEARS.

250
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,033
WE'D HAVE BEEN BACK SOONER IF WE
HADN'T DROPPED A HUNK OF THE MOTOR.

251
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,567
THOUGHT MAYBE YOU TOOK
UP RANCHING IN NEW YORK.

252
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,467
WHAT'S THAT
YOU GOT WITH YOU?

253
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
DIDN'T YOU HEAR? I GOT
MARRIED. THAT'S MY WIFE.

254
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:32,868
HONEY, THIS IS
MR. MEARS.

255
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,000
HE OWNS THE PLACE ACROSS
THE STREET FROM US.

256
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:38,868
I DIDN'T MEAN HER.

257
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,901
OH, I'M SO RELIEVED, I
CAN'T TELL YOU, MR. SMEARS.

258
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:46,334
MEARS!

259
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,133
I HEARD YOU.

260
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:53,968
I MEANT THAT
THERE ANIMAL.

261
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,367
WHAT'S IT FOR?

262
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:56,734
WELL, IT'S A DOG.

263
00:16:56,801 --> 00:17:00,167
I FIGURED IT WAS A DOG, BUT
WHAT'S THE FOOL THING FOR?

264
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:02,033
PORGY, GO BITE
THE NICE MAN.

265
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,067
UH, KAY-

266
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:04,701
WHAT'S YOUR BULL GOT
THAT HE HASN'T GOT?

267
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,534
KAY, YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IT,
BUT YOU'RE LOOKING

268
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,534
AT ONE OF THE TOP BULLS
IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY.

269
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:09,801
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
MR. MEARS?

270
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:10,801
HORNS.

271
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:11,868
HMM?

272
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:14,334
THAT'S WHAT REDDY'S GOT
THAT HE AIN'T GOT!

273
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,634
IS THAT SOMETHING TO BE
PROUD OF AMONG YOU BOYS?

274
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:20,534
WELL, I CAN SEE WHO'S WEARING
THE PANTS AROUND HERE, ALL RIGHT.

275
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:22,100
YOU'RE PRETTY SHARP
THERE, MR. SMEARS-

276
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,267
MEARS, DEAR.

277
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,200
MR. MEARS, DID RED BOY
MAKE GRAND CHAMPION

278
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:26,567
AT THE BARNESVILLE FAIR?

279
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:28,567
NO, HE DIDN'T.
GOT CHEATED.

280
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:31,033
DERN JUDGE GAVE IT TO
TUNK JOHNSON'S BULL AGAIN.

281
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,234
HERCULES PRINCE
TOOK IT, HUH?

282
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,234
YEAH.

283
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,701
THAT'S TOO BAD,
MR. MEARS.

284
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:37,200
DOG!

285
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:38,901
BULL!

286
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,400
WELL, I HOPE WE DON'T SEE MUCH OF HIM!

287
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:44,067
WELL, I HOPE WE DO.

288
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,200
AND, BUCKSHOT, YOU GOT TO BE
MORE CAREFUL HOW YOU TALK TO HIM.

289
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:47,901
WHAT? THAT
OLD GOAT? WHY?

290
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:50,534
BECAUSE WE CAN HARDLY TAKE
A BATH WITHOUT THAT OLD GOAT.

291
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:52,534
OH, WELL, NOW,
JUST A MINUTE!

292
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:54,767
I MEAN THE RANCH. WE
DEPEND ON HIM FOR OUR WATER.

293
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:58,167
OHH. OH, WELL,
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

294
00:17:58,234 --> 00:17:59,234
MOVE OVER, PORGY.

295
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:11,267
THIS IS IT.
WE'RE HOME!

296
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:13,601
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
HONEY?

297
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:20,601
WHY, CHRIS!
IT'S LOVELY!

298
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,567
THE WAY YOU
UNDERPLAYED IT-

299
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,100
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I EXPECTED.

300
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,701
PLUS IT'LL LOOK A LOT BETTER
WHEN WE GET IT FIXED UP.

301
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:31,934
FIXED UP? WHY, CHRIS, I
WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING.

302
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,767
COUGAR ROCK,
HERE WE COME.

303
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:44,767
HEY, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

304
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,601
WELL, ISN'T THIS IT?

305
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,000
NO, NO. IT'S OVER THERE.

306
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,300
W- WELL, LET'S GO!

307
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:37,200
COME ON, PORGY.

308
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,534
WELL?

309
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:42,501
WELL, WHAT?

310
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,033
UH, DISAPPOINTED?

311
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,067
OH, CHRIS! YOU'RE GOING
TO LIVE IN IT, AREN'T YOU?

312
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:50,334
SURE.

313
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,400
THEN IT LOOKS LIKE A HUNK
OF HEAVEN TO ME, YOU DOPE.

314
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:58,734
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I HAVE A
MIND OF MY OWN ANYMORE, ANYWAY?

315
00:19:58,801 --> 00:20:01,367
SOMEDAY, I'M GOING
TO BUILD ME A LAYOUT

316
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,367
AS GOOD AS MEARS'
OVER THERE.

317
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:05,901
WOULD YOU LIKE
A PARTNER, PARDNER?

318
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:07,434
WOULD I.

319
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:13,934
HEY! COME LIKE THAT ALL
THE WAY FROM NEW YORK?

320
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,033
HYAH!

321
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,200
ORVIE!

322
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:18,567
WE BROKE DOWN THE OTHER
SIDE OF TUNK'S PLACE.

323
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,100
I DIDN'T MEAN
THAT, CHRIS.

324
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:22,100
I SEEN YOU SMOOCHING
WITH THE MISSIS,

325
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,067
SO I SAID, "DID YOU COME ALL
THE WAY FROM"...

326
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:25,701
YES, ORVIE,
WE GOT IT.

327
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,334
COME ON. GIVE ME A HAND WITH THIS STUFF.

328
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,601
SURE. TROUBLE, TROUBLE, HUH? BROKE DOWN?

329
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:32,367
I KNEW YOU SHOULD HAVE TOOK ME WITH YOU.

330
00:20:32,434 --> 00:20:33,367
YES, ORVIE.

331
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:34,601
COULD HAVE USED
ANOTHER HORSE.

332
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,100
CHRIS, YOU KNOW I CAN'T LOSE ANY WEIGHT.

333
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:38,567
WHERE ARE
THE KIDS?

334
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:40,100
KIDS? THEY'RE
STILL IN SCHOOL.

335
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:41,567
HEY, HOW WAS
THE HONEYMOON?

336
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:43,100
ORVIE, WILL YOU GET ME

337
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,400
YES, MA'AM.
EXCUSE ME.

338
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:45,534
OH, HI, ALBERT.

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,267
HOW'D THINGS GO?

340
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:49,601
EVERYTHING'S

00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:54,033
HELLO, ALBERT.

344
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,567
HUH. WELL, YOU WON'T

WELL, WHAT DO

350
00:21:18,634 --> 00:21:20,033
THOSE DOGS

351
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,367
OF TREEING
A COUGAR!

352
00:21:21,434 --> 00:21:24,934
WELL, PORGY, SEE WHAT THEY

00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:48,901
HOW DO YOU DO,

367
00:21:48,968 --> 00:21:50,267
JUST CALL HER POKEY.

368
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:51,934

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200

371
00:21:55,934 --> 00:21:57,367
SHE'S A CHARACTER.

372
00:21:57,434 --> 00:22:00,067
BUT, MAN, CAN SHE COOK. WAIT
TILL YOU TASTE HER HOMINY GRITS.

373
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:01,234
I CAN'T WAIT.

374
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,934
HI! HI, DADDY!

375
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,968

MAN, AM I GLAD

380
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,033
WE SAW YOU FROM WAY UP
ON PARTING CREEK TRAIL.

381
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,067
WE ALMOST BURNED OUR
BRITCHES GETTING BACK.

382
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,400
YOU DID, HUH?

383
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,067
I DIDN'T MISS

384
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:27,868
LOOKS LIKE WE GALS SEE EYE

385
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:28,834
OH.

386
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:30,567
DADDY, IS THAT HER?

387
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:32,601

393
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:43,834
HELLO.

394
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,601
WELL, IF I'VE GOT
TO LIVE WITH 3 FEMALES,

395
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,434
I'M GLAD NONE
OF THEM IS GABBY.

396
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:52,000
LOOK! A DOG

397
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:54,033
THEY'RE CUFFS.
PORGY'S A BOY.

398
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,534
KAY'S A LAUGH A MINUTE, ISN'T SHE?

399
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:58,000
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING FROM NEW YORK.

400
00:22:58,067 --> 00:22:59,534
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME AND SEE IT?

401
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:01,000
SURE, THEY'D LIKE
TO GO AND SEE IT.

402
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:02,634
YOU CAN SHOW KAY
THE HOUSE, TOO.

403
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:04,033
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF YOUR HORSES.

404
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,567
YOU RUN ALONG.
WELL, GO AHEAD.

405
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:18,367
THIS IS
THE KITCHEN.

406
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:19,400
WE EAT HERE.

407
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:20,400
THAT'S NICE.

408
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:22,234
DOWN THIS WAY.

409
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:26,234
THIS HERE'S
THE PARLOR, MA'AM.

410
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,567
WE DON'T
USE IT MUCH.

411
00:23:28,634 --> 00:23:30,367
LOOKS NICE
AND COMFORTABLE.

412
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:31,734
WE LIKE IT.

413
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:36,033
THAT POKEY'S BEEN EATING
HER BREAKFAST IN HERE AGAIN!

414
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,901
YOU JUST TELL HER
TO QUIT IT.

415
00:23:37,968 --> 00:23:39,400
I WILL.
DON'T WORRY.

416
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:40,868
THIS WAY, MA'AM.

417
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:44,267
OH, MY!

418
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:46,100
DON'T LET IT
BOTHER YOU, MA'AM.

419
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:47,133
HAPPENS ALL
THE TIME.

420
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,334
IT DOES?

421
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:52,534
THAT'S THE
BATHROOM, MA'AM.

422
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:54,000
THIS IS OUR ROOM.

423
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:55,868
OH. PRETTY.

424
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,033
THIS IS
DADDY'S ROOM.

425
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,667
OH.

426
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:03,167
WELL, IT'S VERY NICE.

427
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:06,534
OH! MY GOODNESS!

428
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:09,033
WE SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT.

429
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,033
ORVIE'S BEEN GOING
TO FIX IT.

430
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,067
WELL, I THINK HE-
HE'D BETTER FIX IT.

431
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:18,033
MY GOODNESS! SOMETHING
LIKE THAT CAN BE DANGEROUS.

432
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,567
HAS THAT ALWAYS BEEN
LIKE THAT?

433
00:24:23,801 --> 00:24:26,067
OH, HERE'S
YOUR PRESENTS.

434
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,400
I PUT THEM
RIGHT HERE ON TOP

435
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,400
SO I'D HAVE THEM JUST
AS SOON AS I GOT HERE.

436
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:35,534
NOW, LET'S SEE.
THIS IS FOR YOU.

437
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,367
THANK YOU, MA'AM.

438
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,067
AND THIS IS FOR YOU.

439
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:40,534
THANK YOU, MA'AM.

440
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:42,067
CAREFUL.

441
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:45,067
WELL, NOW, AREN'T YOU
GOING TO OPEN THEM?

442
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:48,567
DO YOU MIND IF WE TALK
TO YOU FIRST, MA'AM?

443
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:50,100
DO I MIND?

444
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:53,033
OH, THAT'S JUST WHAT
I'VE BEEN WANTING.

445
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,667
COME ON. SIT DOWN
AND FIRE AWAY.

446
00:24:55,734 --> 00:24:57,534
You start.

447
00:24:57,601 --> 00:25:02,033
WELL, MA'AM, THERE'S SOME
THINGS WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU.

448
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,667
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GOING
TO TAKE MOMMY'S PLACE.

449
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,534
WELL, I'D APPRECIATE
ANY SUGGESTIONS.

450
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:12,033
WELL... CAN YOU
MAKE COFFEE?

451
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,534
WELL, I THINK SO.

452
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:15,033
MOTHER ALWAYS MADE DADDY
A CUP OF COFFEE

453
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,701
FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING,

454
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,033
WITH EGGSHELLS.

455
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,534
THINK YOU CAN
DO IT, MA'AM?

456
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,033
I'LL SURE
AS HECK TRY.

457
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,167
AND SHE MADE CLABBER MILK
FLAPJACKS ON SUNDAYS.

458
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:24,400
THINK YOU CAN?

459
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:27,067
CLABBER-FLABBER-
MILKED-

460
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:29,567
OH, MY SPECIALTY!

461
00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:31,167
WHAT ELSE?

462
00:25:31,234 --> 00:25:33,901
WHENEVER DADDY GOT UP ON
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BED,

463
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:36,567
MOTHER ALWAYS MADE HIM GO BACK
AND GET UP ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

464
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:38,067
I'LL DO BETTER
THAN THAT.

465
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:39,901
I'LL MAKE HIM GET UP
ON THE RIGHT SIDE

466
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:41,067
OF THE BED
THE FIRST TIME.

467
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,033
SOMETIMES THAT'S
A CHORE, MA'AM.

468
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,400
OH.

469
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:46,868
IS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE?

470
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:49,534
ABOUT ALL I
CAN THINK OF.

471
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:56,534
I don't.

472
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:57,534
I DO.

473
00:25:57,601 --> 00:25:58,501
WELL, I DON'T.

474
00:25:58,567 --> 00:25:59,534
I DO!

475
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,033
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY. I DON'T!

476
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,033
I DO!

477
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,334
I DON'T!

478
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,000
WAIT A MINUTE. MAYBE I
COULD HELP YOU SETTLE IT.

479
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,534
WHAT IS IT?

480
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:12,868
WELL, I THINK YOU'RE A
LITTLE PRETTIER THAN JEAN.

481
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:14,033
JEAN?

482
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,868
JEAN MORROW. SHE
LIVES ON THE NEXT RANCH

483
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:17,534
AND LOOKS AFTER US
WHEN DADDY GOES AWAY.

484
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:18,767
OH.

485
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:21,501
I GUESS DADDY JUST
LIKED YOU BETTER.

486
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:23,033
OHH!

487
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,534
A WATCH!
JUST WHAT I BEEN-

488
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:28,033

489
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,067
ME, TOO!
THANK YOU, MA'AM.

490
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:32,467
THANKS A LOT,
MA'AM.

491
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:35,901
OH, GIRLS, DO YOU THINK
IF YOU TRIED REAL HARD,

492
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:38,868
YOU MIGHT FIND SOMETHING
TO CALL ME BESIDES "MA'AM"?

493
00:26:38,934 --> 00:26:40,400
MAYBE.

494
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:53,968
TIME YOU GOT?

495
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:54,968
9:15.

496
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,167
ME, TOO.

497
00:26:56,234 --> 00:26:58,467
OH, DADDY, THESE WATCHES ARE WONDERFUL!

498
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,734
THEY BOTH SAY
THE SAME TIME.

499
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:01,200
THEY OUGHT TO.

500
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:03,033
SHE BOUGHT THEM IN THE
BIGGEST STORE IN NEW YORK.

501
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,334
GEE, THAT'S SUPER.

502
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,934
YEAH.

503
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,534
WE SURE WERE LUCKY TO FIND
SOMEBODY LIKE KAY, WEREN'T WE?

504
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:12,501
I MEAN, SHE'S JUST WHAT WE BEEN
NEEDING AROUND HERE, ISN'T SHE?

505
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:14,534
WELL, SHE'S
PRETTY AND ALL,

506
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:16,534
AND SHE
SEEMS NICE.

507
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:19,033
OF COURSE, WE ONLY JUST MET HER.

508
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,868
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO
FIND SHE'S PRETTY WONDERFUL.

509
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:23,367
SURE LIKE MY WATCH.

510
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:26,534
BUT YOU'VE ONLY KNOWN
HER A WEEK OR SO, DADDY.

511
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:29,033
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SOMETHING

512
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,000
AND YOU STUDY IT
REAL HARD,

513
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,567
YOU CAN FIND OUT AN AWFUL LOT
ABOUT IT IN A MIGHTY SHORT TIME.

514
00:27:33,634 --> 00:27:35,567
HOW COME YOU
MARRIED HER SO QUICK?

515
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:37,033
ORVIE SAID
IT WAS LIKE THAT.

516
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,567
WELL, I FELL IN LOVE
WITH HER LIKE THAT.

517
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:43,067
BUT YOU TOLD US YOU WENT
WITH MOTHER FOR 3 WHOLE YEARS.

518
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:45,033
I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOUR
MOTHER LIKE THAT, TOO,

519
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,567
BUT IT TOOK ME
3 WHOLE YEARS

520
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:48,567
TO GET UP THE GUMPTION
TO ASK HER TO MARRY ME.

521
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,400
HOW COME YOU ASKED KAY
SO QUICK?

522
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:52,601
THIS TIME, I HAD
A HAND FROM ORVIE.

523
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:55,367
OH, ORVIE! HE'S ALWAYS
BUTTING IN ON THINGS.

524
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:58,667
NAN, LISTEN
TO ME, HONEY.

525
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:05,968
BUT IF YOU'D JUST
GIVE HER A CHANCE,

526
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:08,000
I THINK MAYBE SHE CAN
COME KIND OF CLOSE.

527
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:09,534
HOW ABOUT IT?

528
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:10,968
OH, DADDY!

529
00:28:12,434 --> 00:28:14,334
OK, KIDS. COME ON.

530
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,501
CLIMB IN THE SACK.

531
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:22,968
THERE. GOOD NIGHT,
PUMPKINS.

532
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:24,234
NIGHT, DADDY.

533
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:35,701
JEEPERS. THEY EVEN
TELL TIME IN THE DARK.

534
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:37,033
MINE DOES, TOO.

535
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:42,067
WHAT A DAY!

536
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:43,868
KIND OF ROUGH, HUH?

537
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:47,634
WHAT TIME DO WE
GET UP AROUND HERE?

538
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:49,400
YOU MUST BE
DEAD TIRED, HONEY.

539
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:51,234
WHY DON'T YOU SLEEP IN
IN THE MORNING?

540
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,334
GET UP AROUND 6:00.

541
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,834
HA HA!

542
00:28:57,734 --> 00:29:00,334
WHAT TIME DID YOU SAY?

543
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,968
6:15.

544
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,934
YOU...

545
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:14,801
YAAAA!

546
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:25,067
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT A HUNCH
WE'RE IN FOR A SHIVAREE.

547
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:26,634
SHIVER WHAT?

548
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:27,968
GET INTO SOMETHING.

549
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,367
GET INTO SOMETHING
SPECIAL.

550
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,000
YOU'RE ENTERTAINING.

551
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:34,334
OH, NO!

552
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:55,868
HA HA!

553
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:57,067
KAY, HURRY UP!

554
00:29:57,133 --> 00:30:00,067
HEY, KAY,
GET OUT OF THE HAY!

555
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,567
I JUST PULLED
A GOOD ONE.

556
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,567
I SAID, "HEY, KAY,
GET OUT OF THE HAY!"

557
00:30:05,634 --> 00:30:07,067
HI, JEAN!

558
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,901

THE SHIVAREE.

559
00:30:08,968 --> 00:30:10,901
JOINED IT?
I ORGANIZED IT!

560
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:13,067
I WANT YOU TO BE THE
FIRST TO MEET HER. COME ON.

561
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:14,434
KAY?

562
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:16,033
OH!

563
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,567
COME OUT

564
00:30:17,634 --> 00:30:18,534
OH!

565
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:20,100
I WANT YOU
TO MEET JEAN MORROW.

566
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,100
JEAN, THIS IS KAY.

567
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:23,100
I'M GLAD
TO MEET YOU, JEAN.

568
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:25,067
I'M SO HAPPY
FOR YOU, KAY.

569
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:26,767
HOW'S THIS FOR
PICKING THEM, JEAN?

570
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:29,067
GOOD EYE, COWBOY.
CONGRATULATIONS.

571
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:32,100
HERE, YOU BIG LUG, TAKE THAT
AND PUT IT IN THE KITCHEN.

572
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:33,767
NOW, CAN I HELP
YOU WITH THAT?

573
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:37,100
I THINK I'VE GOT IT ON WRONG
- OH, DEAR, DEAR!

574
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:38,567
SUCH A PRETTY DRESS!

575
00:30:38,634 --> 00:30:40,667
BUT IT LOOKS BETTER
IF I GET IT ON RIGHT.

576
00:30:41,968 --> 00:30:44,834
COME ON, FOLKS. LET'S
GET THE PARTY STARTED.

577
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:46,200

00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,067
DADDY!

582
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,067

PLEASE?

584
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,067
YOU CAN STAY UP
FOR A WHILE.

585
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:59,400
SO YOU WENT
AND DONE IT, HUH?

586
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:02,067
WELL, MY HEART SURE BLEEDS FOR
THE POOR LITTLE BRIDE. HA HA!

587
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:03,234
THANK YOU.

588
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,567
WELL, HONEY,
THIS IS TUNK JOHNSON.

589
00:31:05,634 --> 00:31:08,067
HE OWNS THE BULL THAT OUT-BULLED
MEARS' BULL THIS YEAR.

590
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,200
EVERY YEAR.

591
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,567
BULLY FOR YOU!

592
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:12,567

593
00:31:12,634 --> 00:31:14,067

594
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:17,567
ME, I'M BERT.

595
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:20,734
HI. HELLO.
HOW DO YOU DO?

596
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:29,100
OH,
IT'S YOU, CHRIS.

597
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:30,601
WANT TO CUT IN?

598
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:31,601
NO. LATER, HUH?

599
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:34,601
I SAID, DO YOU
WANT TO CUT IN?

600
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,067
NO. NOT NOW.

601
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:38,100
WHOO!

602
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:39,634
HOW AM I DOING,
DADDY?

603
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:42,100
YOU'RE DOING FINE.
WAIT TILL I GET RID OF THIS.

604
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,300
OK.

605
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:49,067
WELL, I WARN YOU, JEAN,

606
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:51,601
I'M GOING TO LEAN ON YOU
HEAVILY FOR ADVICE.

607
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:52,734
YOU'LL DO OK.

608
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:54,501
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
KIND OF INSIDES.

609
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,834
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEM TO
GIVE UP A CAREER LIKE YOURS.

610
00:31:56,901 --> 00:31:58,501
I DIDN'T GIVE IT UP.

611
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:00,534
I JUST SWAPPED IT FOR
SOMETHING I WANTED MORE.

612
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:01,868
GOOD GIRL.

613
00:32:01,968 --> 00:32:03,534
GOOD GIRL, YOURSELF.

614
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:07,567
YOU WERE A SWEETHEART TO TAKE CARE
OF THOSE KIDS WHILE CHRIS WAS AWAY.

615
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:11,067
I DON'T SUPPOSE HE'S TOLD YOU
HOW HE TOOK CARE OF OUR RANCH

616
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:13,534
ALL THOSE MONTHS MY
STEVE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

617
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:16,667
NO. NO, HE DIDN'T,
BUT THEN, HE WOULDN'T.

618
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,200
NO.

619
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:20,000
NO, HE WOULDN'T.

620
00:32:30,634 --> 00:32:32,934
HEY, YOU TWO,
BREAK IT UP IN THERE.

621
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,434
COMING OUT.

622
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:36,334
THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
WANTED SOME REFRESHMENTS.

623
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,434
WE JUST SAID THAT
TO GET RID OF YOU.

624
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:40,100
YOU'RE NEVER GOING
TO GET RID OF ME.

625
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,767
DID SHE SHAKE ANY
SKELETONS OUT OF MY CLOSET?

626
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,434
NOT A SINGLE BONE,
DARN IT.

627
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:47,601
HEY, KAY,
COME HERE.

628
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:48,601
COMING!

629
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:53,901
CHRIS' WIFE IS JUST
AS NICE AS SHE CAN BE.

630
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:57,300
BUT I'VE SAID IT BEFORE
AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN:

631
00:32:57,367 --> 00:33:00,033
MEN ARE THE BIGGEST FOOLS
IN CREATION.

632
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,534
JEAN WOULD HAVE MADE
CHRIS SUCH A NICE WIFE.

633
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:04,834
SHE'D HAVE BEEN
A REAL HELP TO HIM,

634
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:07,067
THE WAY SHE RUNS THAT RANCH OF HERS NOW.

635
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:11,033
POOR JEAN, LOSING STEVE
AND NOW LOSING CHRIS, TOO.

636
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,167
I HOPE SHE DON'T GO INTO
A DECLINE LIKE AMY DID

637
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:17,133
WHEN FRANK RUN OFF
WITH THAT CARNIVAL GIRL.

638
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:21,000
* THE MAN WITH
THE BIG FELT HAT *

639
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:23,567
* OH, THE MAN
WITH THE BIG FELT HAT *

640
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:26,501

HIS STOCK IS FED *

641
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:28,868

AND WATERED OLD RED *

642
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:31,467

HE'S BACK IN BED *

643
00:33:31,534 --> 00:33:34,000
* THE MAN
WITH THE BIG FELT HAT *

644
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:36,434
* THE MAN WITH
THE BIG FELT HAT *

645
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:39,167
* OH, THE MAN
WITH THE BIG FELT HAT *

646
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:42,000
* AROUND THE RANCH,
HE'S KIND OF SLOW *

647
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:44,534
* LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER JOE *

648
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:46,968
* BUT YOU OUGHT TO SEE HIM
AT THE RODEO *

649
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:49,000
* THE MAN
WITH THE BIG FELT HAT *

650
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:50,000
WHO?

651
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:55,234
* THE MAN
WITH THE BIG FELT HAT *

652
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:00,367
* HE ALWAYS MAKES YOU PROUD
ANYWHERE, IN ANY CROWD *

653
00:34:00,434 --> 00:34:02,667
* FROM WHAT I HEAR,
HE RAISED- *

654
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:05,033
* BEST DARN DATE
IN 48 STATES *

655
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,534
* THE MAN
WITH THE BIG FELT HAT *

656
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:10,367
* OH, THE MAN
WITH THE BIG FELT HAT *

657
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:12,767
* YOUR ONLY COMPETITION HERE *

658
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:15,434
* IS A COUGAR TRACK
THAT'S FRESH AND CLEAR *

659
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:18,133
* AND I'LL GET THAT CAT
IF IT TAKES A YEAR *

660
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,434
* THE MAN
WITH THE BIG FELT HAT *

661
00:34:20,501 --> 00:34:23,367
* THE MAN WITH
THE BIG FELT HAT *

662
00:34:23,434 --> 00:34:25,033
ALL RIGHT.
MAKE A BIG CIRCLE.

663
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,067
COME ON,
HIT IT, BOYS.

664
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:32,501
ALL JOIN HANDS,
CIRCLE SOUTH.

665
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:35,567
LET A LITTLE MOONSHINE
IN YOUR MOUTH.

666
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:37,400
HALFWAY ROUND,
TURN RIGHT BACK,

667
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,067
SINGLE FILE,
INDIAN STYLE.

668
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:40,834
WHOO WHOO WHOO!

669
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:43,267
EVERYBODY BREAK
AND SWING.

670
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,801
FACE THE CENTER
OF THE RING.

671
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:48,934
CLAP YOUR HANDS,
SLAP YOUR KNEES.

672
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,467
BOOMPS-A-DAISY,
IF YOU PLEASE,

673
00:34:50,534 --> 00:34:52,701
AND SWING
THAT CORNER GIRL AROUND.

674
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,067
ENGINE GOING
DOWN THE TRACK.

675
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:57,968
SWING AROUND
AND COME RIGHT BACK.

676
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,067
UH-OH.

677
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,367
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

678
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,567
LOOK WHO'S STICKING
HIS HEAD IN THE WINDOW.

679
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:06,000
WELL, IF IT ISN'T THAT
OLD DARLING SMEARSY.

680
00:35:06,067 --> 00:35:07,300
WHY DOESN'T HE COME IN?

681
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:08,701
I GUESS
HE WASN'T INVITED.

682
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:10,534
PROBABLY CAME OVER TO
COMPLAIN ABOUT THE NOISE.

683
00:35:10,601 --> 00:35:12,067
WE'RE KEEPING
RED BOY UP, HUH?

684
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:13,534
HE'S PROBABLY GOT
RED BOY WITH HIM.

685
00:35:13,601 --> 00:35:14,868
PRETEND
YOU DON'T SEE HIM.

686
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:17,200
YOU TOLD ME TO BE NICE
TO HIM. GO AND ASK HIM IN.

687
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:18,767
NO. TONIGHT
I'M HAVING FUN.

688
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:20,400
WHOO-HOO!

689
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:23,133
HIM AND HIS WATER.
LET HIM STAY OUT THERE.

690
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,901
WHAT'S ALL THIS TALK ABOUT
WATER? THE FAUCETS RUN.

691
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:27,501
HE'S LETTING US HAVE
SOME, BUT NOT ENOUGH-

692
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:29,234
NOT IF WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE THIS RANCH PAY BIG.

693
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,734
MAKE HIM GIVE YOU
SOME MORE.

694
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:32,701
THE OLD BUZZARD WON'T GIVE
ME ANY MORE, NOT AT ANY PRICE.

695
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:34,234
DOES HE HATE MONEY?

696
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,534
NO. JUST PEOPLE.

697
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:36,801
OH.

698
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,601
CLAP YOUR HANDS,
SLAP YOUR KNEES.

699
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:39,534
BOOMPS-A-DAISY-

700
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:41,033
I'M GOING OUT
AND MOO AT HIM.

701
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,234
NOW, KAY,
WAIT A MINUTE.

702
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:49,701
WHY, MR. MEARS, I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU WERE OUT HERE.

703
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:51,067
EVENING.

704
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:53,868
I JUST CAME OUT
TO GET A BREATH OF AIR.

705
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:55,367
HOW'S RED BOY?

706
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:57,534
HOPE HE'S ALL RIGHT WITH
ALL THIS RUCKUS GOING ON.

707
00:35:57,601 --> 00:36:00,501
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN
THE RUCKUS, MR. MEARS?

708
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:02,534
I AIN'T HERE
TO RAISE NOTHING.

709
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:05,033
COME OVER ON ACCOUNT OF THE NOISE
WOULD HAVE KEPT ME AWAKE ANYHOW.

710
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,701
AS LONG
AS YOU'RE AWAKE,

711
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:08,501
WHY DON'T YOU COME IN
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME?

712
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,534
I WASN'T ASKED,
SO I AIN'T GOING.

713
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,868
IT'S MY SHIVAREE,
AND I'M ASKING YOU.

714
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:14,801
BESIDES, TUNK JOHNSON'S IN THERE.

715
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:17,033
HE HASN'T GOT
HIS BULL WITH HIM.

716
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,000
COME ON IN.
YOU JUST STAY CLOSE TO ME.

717
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:22,534
HOLD IT!
HOLD IT, EVERYBODY!

718
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:25,033
IN THE EXCITEMENT, SOMEBODY
FORGOT TO INVITE MR. MEARS,

719
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,067
SO I WENT OVER
AND GOT HIM.

720
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:28,834
GLAD YOU CAME OVER,
MR. MEARS.

721
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:30,567
LET ME TAKE YOUR HAT. CAN I
GET YOU A DRINK OR SOMETHING?

722
00:36:30,634 --> 00:36:32,234
NO. HE'S GOING
TO DANCE WITH ME FIRST.

723
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,400
DON'T DANCE.

724
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:34,534
OF COURSE YOU DO.

725
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:36,934
EVERYBODY SWING.

726
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:41,567
CIRCLE FORWARD,
GO WHERE YOU KNOW.

727
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:47,467
I'LL SWING YOUR GIRL.
YOU SWING MINE.

728
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,968
I'LL SWING MY OWN
ANY OLD TIME.

729
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:53,234
OH, GOLLY,
AIN'T THAT FINE?

730
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:58,634
EVERYBODY MAKE A RING.

731
00:36:58,701 --> 00:37:01,000
CLAP YOUR HANDS,
SLAP YOUR KNEES.

732
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:02,334
BOOMPS-A-DAISY,
IF YOU PLEASE,

733
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,334
AND SWING
THAT CORNER GIRL AROUND.

734
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:13,000
MAKE A FOOL OF ME,
WILL YOU?

735
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:14,534
I'LL SHOW YOU!

736
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:16,534
OH, MR. MEARS,
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

737
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,033
WHY DID YOU MAKE HIM DANCE
WHEN HE DIDN'T WANT TO?

738
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,133
OH, I DON'T KNOW. I WAS
JUST TRYING TO BE HELPFUL.

739
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,667
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
BUCKSHOT.

740
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:25,534
HE SURE LOOKED
SILLY, DIDN'T HE?

741
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:28,000
ON WITH THE MUSIC.
COME ON, ORVS.

742
00:37:31,634 --> 00:37:32,734
* MAN WITH
THE BIG FELT HAT *

743
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:34,033
* OH, THE MAN
WITH THE BIG FELT HAT *

744
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,567
ENGINE GOING
DOWN THE TRACK.

745
00:37:35,634 --> 00:37:37,067
TURN AROUND
AND COME RIGHT BACK.

746
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,567
CLAP YOUR HANDS,
SLAP YOUR KNEES.

747
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:40,234
BOOMPS-A-DAISY,
IF YOU PLEASE.

748
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,067
AH, SOME SHINDIG,
HUH, BUCKSHOT?

749
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:43,367
YEAH.

750
00:37:43,434 --> 00:37:45,033
ONLY TROUBLE IS,
IT BROKE UP TOO EARLY.

751
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,033
OHH! OW!

752
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:48,067
OH, CHRIS, STOP IT!

753
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,534
OH, ENGINE GOING

754
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,567
TURN AROUND,
COME RIGHT BACK.

755
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:18,968
WILL YOU LOOK

756
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:20,234
PARTY'S HERE.

757
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,100
HE'S THE ONE WHO WANTED
TO GET AN EARLY START!

758
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,100
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM
A GUY ON HIS HONEYMOON?

759
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:26,033
HEY, CHRIS, OPEN THEM
PRETTY BLUE EYES, SWEETHEART.

760
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,634
YOU GOING TO LAY THERE
ON YOUR COYOTE ALL DAY?

761
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:29,167
LOOK WHAT TIME

762
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:31,534
MY GOSH, I PLUMB FORGOT
TO SET THAT ALARM.

763
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,501
GET YOUR PANTS ON.

764
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:36,701
I'LL TELL YOU, FELLAS,
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

765
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,601
COME ON. COME ON.

766
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,133
OH, CHRIS.

767
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,167

00:38:42,234 --> 00:38:43,400
OH, HI, KAY. SWELL PARTY LAST NIGHT.

00:38:43,467 --> 00:38:44,667
YEAH.

770
00:38:44,734 --> 00:38:46,067
ME AND THE BOYS
ARE GOING ON A COUGAR HUNT.

771
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:47,567
I FORGOT
TO TELL YOU.

772
00:38:47,634 --> 00:38:49,234
THAT'S JUST DANDY.
HOPE YOU HAVE FUN.

773
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,901
WE OUGHT TO BE HOME

774
00:38:50,968 --> 00:38:53,300
OH, WE'LL BE

775
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:54,300

776
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:55,334
OHHH!

777
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,300
EXCUSE ME.

778
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,501
THAT'S
ALL RIGHT.

779
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:58,501
PULL THEM UP
A LITTLE.

780
00:38:58,567 --> 00:38:59,634
YEAH, I WILL.

781
00:38:59,701 --> 00:39:01,734

00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:08,501
HENDERSON CLAIMS THAT'S

785
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:11,868
DARN IT.

786
00:39:12,968 --> 00:39:15,033

00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:22,534

...THE OTHER END.

794
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:29,067
...WOULDN'T HAVE
THIS TROUBLE.

795
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,567
I SLEEP
ON THE FLOOR.

796
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,534
I'LL SPEAK
TO HIM ABOUT IT.

797
00:39:32,601 --> 00:39:34,033
CHRIS, I SAW HIS TRACKS
YESTERDAY MORNING.

798
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,534
SURE IS A BIG ONE.

799
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:36,534
WHO?

800
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:38,033
KILLED ONE
OF JIM'S CALVES

801
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,534
ON THE OTHER SIDE
YESTERDAY,

802
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:41,033
SO HE CAN'T HAVE
MOVED OUT YET.

803
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,033
WE BETTER GET HIM BEFORE
HE GETS SOME OF OUR STOCK.

804
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,934
OW!

805
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,634
OH! NO!

806
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:52,567
OH, HI, PORG.

807
00:39:52,634 --> 00:39:55,067
WHOA! WHAT'S THAT?

808
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:57,033
IT'S A DOG.

809
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,801
WHAT'S HE FOR?

810
00:39:58,868 --> 00:40:02,167
AHEM. PORGY IS
AN ELECTRICIAN.

811
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,567
HE FIXES RADIOS
AND FUSES AND WIRING.

812
00:40:04,634 --> 00:40:07,234
WE FIND HE'S A VERY HANDY
DOG TO HAVE AROUND THE HOUSE.

813
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,367
AN ELECTRICIAN?

814
00:40:08,434 --> 00:40:09,567
YES.

815
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:12,067
HA HA! LADY,
YOU'RE SURE A CARD!

816
00:40:13,634 --> 00:40:17,033
MY LIFELONG AMBITION,
ACHIEVED AT LAST.

817
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,934
HEY, WHAT KIND
OF A MUTT IS THAT?

818
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:21,567
A MUTT?

819
00:40:21,634 --> 00:40:26,968
ARE YOU REFERRING TO CHARLEMAGNE
CHAFLEUR DE LA FONTAINE DE L'AMBRIAC?

820
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:29,067
NO KIDDING.

821
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:30,934
OK, FELLAS.
I'M ALL SET.

822
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,100

823
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:33,100
SO LONG.

824
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:34,100
BYE, KAY.

825
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:35,434
NICE SEEING YOU.

826
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:36,601
ELECTRICIAN. HA HA!

827
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,567
GOOD-BYE, BABY.
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

828
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:40,434
OH, NO.
I'M GOING TO GET UP.

829
00:40:40,501 --> 00:40:41,767
IT'S KIND OF EARLY.

830
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,367
I LIKE
TO GET UP EARLY.

831
00:40:43,434 --> 00:40:44,434
COME ON,
CHRIS!

832
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:45,767
OK! GOOD-BYE,
HONEY.

833
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:47,267
GOOD-BYE.
HAPPY HUNTING.

834
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:48,868
I'LL BE BACK

835
00:40:48,934 --> 00:40:50,267
ALL RIGHT.

836
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:04,701
GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT,
TINA.

837
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:07,801
SHE IS PRETTIER THAN
JEAN AND LOTS OF FUN.

838
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:09,501
SHE SMELLS AWFUL GOOD.

839
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,501
AND THEY ARE
BEAUTIFUL WATCHES.

840
00:41:15,467 --> 00:41:17,067
OF COURSE,
THE MAIN THING IS,

841
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:19,234
IS SHE GOING TO BE A FAIR
HAND AROUND THE RANCH?

842
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,067
THAT'S WHAT DADDY
NEEDS MOST.

843
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:24,033
WON'T TAKE LONG
TO FIND THAT OUT.

844
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,033
YEAH!

845
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:33,734

00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:34,734
OOOOOH!

00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:36,567
OH! AH.

848
00:41:36,634 --> 00:41:38,067
KAY, DID WE
WAKE YOU UP?

849
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:40,567
OH, ME? LITTLE OLD
BRIGHT EYES?

850
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:42,100
WE'VE GOT CHORES

851
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,234
CHORES?

852
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,434
YEAH. CHORES.

853
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:45,667
OH, SURE! CHORES.

854
00:41:45,734 --> 00:41:47,801
WE'LL MEET YOU IN THE
BARN IN 10 MINUTES, OK?

855
00:41:47,868 --> 00:41:48,834
SURE. 10 MINUTES.

856
00:41:48,901 --> 00:41:50,601
IT'S GETTING LATE.
ALMOST 5:00.

857
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:52,167
5:00-OH!

858
00:41:52,234 --> 00:41:54,968
AND I HAD TO
GIVE THEM WATCHES!

859
00:42:01,534 --> 00:42:02,968
HEY, KAY!

860
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:06,300
WE WON'T NEVER FINISH UNLESS YOU
THROW DOWN MORE HAY THAN THAT!

861
00:42:18,434 --> 00:42:22,300
GOSH, KAY, WE DIDN'T MEAN
FOR YOU TO BRING IT DOWN!

862
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:23,901
I LIKE SHORTCUTS.

863
00:42:35,801 --> 00:42:37,501
WHOA!

864
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,467
COME ON. PUT
YOUR LEG RIGHT UP THERE.

865
00:42:52,534 --> 00:42:53,501
NOW GRAB HOLD
UP THERE.

866
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,534
I KNOW.

867
00:42:54,601 --> 00:42:55,534
GRAB HOLD.

868
00:42:55,601 --> 00:42:56,501
THAT'S IT.

869
00:42:56,567 --> 00:42:58,901
1, 2, 3...

870
00:42:58,968 --> 00:42:59,901
GO!

871
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:01,767
SWING YOUR
OTHER LEG OVER.

872
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:02,901
THAT'S IT!

873
00:43:02,968 --> 00:43:04,200
OH.

874
00:43:04,267 --> 00:43:05,234
OH!

875
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,067
WHOA!

876
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:10,067
NOW WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW
TO BRING IN THE COWS.

877
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:11,567
COME ON.
GIDDYAP!

878
00:43:11,634 --> 00:43:14,067
DON'T GO TOO FAST
TO START WITH.

879
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,267
COME ON, DEAR.

880
00:43:16,634 --> 00:43:20,400
YOU GIRLS GO ON AHEAD,
AND I'LL FOLLOW.

881
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:25,634
OOOOOH!

882
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:28,601
HEY!

883
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:33,567
HEY, KAY.
WAIT A MINUTE.

884
00:43:33,634 --> 00:43:35,534
WAIT FOR US, KAY.

885
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:38,767
WHOA! WHOA!

886
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:40,334
DON'T GO SO FAST!

887
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,300
WE CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH YOU, KAY!

888
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:45,067
OHHHHHH!

889
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:46,434
OH!

890
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:48,267
PULL BACK!
PULL BACK!

891
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,267
WHOA!

892
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:51,267
TURN TO
THE LEFT, KAY!

893
00:43:51,334 --> 00:43:53,000
NO, TURN HIM
TO THE RIGHT!

894
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:54,434
WHOA, GEORGE!

895
00:43:57,734 --> 00:44:00,801
KAY, DON'T YOU KNOW
HOW TO JUMP FENCES?

896
00:44:00,868 --> 00:44:03,267
WELL, I MADE IT,
DIDN'T I?

897
00:44:03,334 --> 00:44:06,067
IT'S THAT FOOL HORSE
THAT DOESN'T KNOW HOW.

898
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:08,434
OOOH! OHHH!

899
00:44:25,067 --> 00:44:26,167
OOOH!

900
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:29,467
OH, NO.

901
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:31,200
STINK-UM
PLENTY GOOD, HUH?

902
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:32,567
YOU-

903
00:44:32,634 --> 00:44:35,400
YOU GIVE ME THAT!

904
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:38,400
AND DO GET OUT
OF THAT DRESS.

905
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,901
YOU NO LIKE-UM?

906
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,901
NO, I NO LIKE IT.

907
00:44:41,968 --> 00:44:43,067
YOU GET OUT OF IT,
AND HURRY, TOO.

908
00:44:43,133 --> 00:44:44,367
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

909
00:44:44,467 --> 00:44:45,901
YOU GET OUT
OF MY ROOM.

910
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:47,267
ME GO.

911
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:49,267
YOU PACK YOUR THINGS AND
GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE, TOO.

912
00:44:49,334 --> 00:44:50,567
ME GO.

913
00:44:50,634 --> 00:44:52,033
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

914
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,000
YOU TAKE OFF
MY SLIPPERS!

915
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,534
HURT FEET ANYWAY.

916
00:44:55,601 --> 00:44:57,534
AND DON'T YOU
EVER COME BACK.

917
00:44:57,601 --> 00:44:58,901
ALL RIGHT. ME GO.

918
00:44:58,968 --> 00:45:00,834
DON'T YOU
EVER COME BACK!

919
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,434
WHAT ARE YOU
SO HAPPY ABOUT?

920
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:43,801
KAY?

921
00:45:43,868 --> 00:45:45,667
CAN WE COME IN?

922
00:45:45,734 --> 00:45:47,767
OH, YES, DARLINGS.

923
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:50,534
COME IN, DARLINGS.

924
00:45:57,934 --> 00:45:59,200
HERE.

925
00:45:59,267 --> 00:46:01,267
IT'S FOR YOU.

926
00:46:03,133 --> 00:46:04,200
WHY-

927
00:46:04,267 --> 00:46:06,734
IT BELONGED
TO OUR REAL MOTHER.

928
00:46:06,801 --> 00:46:08,667
SHE WAS
AWFUL BRAVE, TOO.

929
00:46:08,734 --> 00:46:10,033
TAKE IT.

930
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,000
OH, I-

931
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:13,534
I CAN'T.

932
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:15,133
WHY NOT?

933
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,000
DON'T YOU LIKE IT?

934
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:21,000
OH, MY LAMBS!

935
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:23,033
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

936
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,000
BUT I CAN'T TAKE IT,
NOT FOR BEING BRAVE.

937
00:46:26,067 --> 00:46:28,567
I WAS SCARED
EVERY MINUTE TODAY,

938
00:46:28,634 --> 00:46:30,267
AND YOU TWO LITTLE DEVILS
KNOW IT.

939
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:32,067
SURE WE DO.

940
00:46:32,133 --> 00:46:34,200
BUT DADDY SAYS WHEN YOU'RE
SCARED TO DO SOMETHING

941
00:46:34,267 --> 00:46:35,901
AND YOU DO IT ANYWAYS,

942
00:46:35,968 --> 00:46:38,400
THAT'S REALLY
BEING BRAVE.

943
00:46:38,467 --> 00:46:40,567
YEAH. TAKE IT.

944
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:42,434
WE WANT YOU TO.

945
00:46:46,133 --> 00:46:48,534
MAY I SAY,
FELLOW CLUB MEMBERS,

946
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:52,567
THAT THIS IS THE PROUDEST
MOMENT OF MY LIFE.

947
00:46:53,868 --> 00:46:55,567
OH, KAY!
OH, KAY!

948
00:46:55,634 --> 00:46:58,501
OH! OH! OOH!
MY BACK.

949
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:00,701
HEY, BUCKSHOT!
WHERE ARE YOU?

950
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:02,501
HEY, YOU STILL IN BED?

951
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:04,367
YOU OUGHT TO SEE
THE COUGAR WE GOT.

952
00:47:04,434 --> 00:47:06,000
IT'S BIGGER THAN
A YOUNG HEIFER.

953
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:07,534
LET'S GO LOOK!

954
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:09,501
IT'S ON THE BACK PORCH.

955
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,200
I, UH, BROUGHT THE BOYS
HOME FOR SUPPER.

956
00:47:12,267 --> 00:47:15,701
COULDN'T I MEET THEM
SOMETIME WITH MY CLOTHES ON?

957
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:17,868
TELL POKEY
TO GET COOKING.

958
00:47:17,934 --> 00:47:21,067
WE'RE HUNGRY ENOUGH TO EAT
THAT COUGAR WITH THE FUR ON.

959
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:22,667
ALL RIGHT.

960
00:47:22,734 --> 00:47:25,033
OH, BUT-
BUT POKEY'S-

961
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,300
OOOH.

962
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:28,701
SHOT HIM RIGHT
THROUGH THERE.

963
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,033
OH, DADDY, HE ISN'T
SUCH A BIG ONE.

964
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,033
OH, IS THAT SO? HE WAS
A TOUGH OLD CAT, ANYWAY.

965
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,534
IT TOOK TWO SHOTS
TO GET HIM.

966
00:47:34,634 --> 00:47:35,734
TWO SHOTS!

967
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:36,901
YOU'RE SLIPPING!

968
00:47:36,968 --> 00:47:38,701
DID YOU KIDS GET
YOUR CHORES DONE?

969
00:47:38,767 --> 00:47:40,067
NOT EXACTLY.

970
00:47:40,133 --> 00:47:42,901
BETTER GET AT IT. IT'LL
BE SUPPERTIME PRETTY QUICK.

971
00:47:42,968 --> 00:47:44,200
OH, CHRIS-

972
00:47:44,267 --> 00:47:45,667
OH!

973
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:20,033
OH, CHRIS...

974
00:48:25,801 --> 00:48:28,033
OH!

975
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,534
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BUCKSHOT?

976
00:48:30,601 --> 00:48:32,033
WHY ARE YOU
CRYING, BABY?

977
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,000
I CAN'T...

978
00:48:34,067 --> 00:48:35,734
YOU CAN'T WHAT?

979
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,901
I CAN'T COOK
A COUGAR.

980
00:48:39,968 --> 00:48:41,267
YOU CAN'T-

981
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:45,033
OH, IT'S NOT FUNNY.

982
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,434
HONEST? CAN'T YOU
COOK A COUGAR?

983
00:48:46,501 --> 00:48:49,634
I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY
NICE OF YOU TO LAUGH AT ME.

984
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,000
BUT, JEAN, I'VE GOT TO
HAVE SOMEONE TO HELP ME.

985
00:48:56,067 --> 00:48:58,000
YOU WOULDN'T WANT CHRIS
AND ME TO MURDER EACH OTHER

986
00:48:58,067 --> 00:48:59,734
WHILE THE HONEYMOON'S
STILL YOUNG.

987
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:01,501
THE NEXT TIME
YOU CATCH YOUR COOK

988
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:03,000
WEARING YOUR
HATTIE CARNEGIE

989
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:05,400
AND TAKING A BATH IN YOUR
FAVORITE PERFUME, DON'T FIRE HER.

990
00:49:05,467 --> 00:49:07,868
SERVANTS ARE NOT
SCARCE AROUND HERE.

991
00:49:07,934 --> 00:49:09,501
THERE JUST AREN'T ANY.

992
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:11,000
JULIA CRADDOCK
GETS AROUND.

993
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:12,634
SHE MAY KNOW
OF SOMEONE.

994
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:14,033
WONDER WHERE JULIA IS.

995
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,501
SHE MUST BE AILING,

996
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:16,667
NOT TO GET TO THE PHONE.

997
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:19,667
HI. I HAD TO RUN
BASTE MY CHICKEN.

998
00:49:19,734 --> 00:49:21,033
LISTEN,
THERE'S A FELLA

999
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,701
USED TO COOK
FOR LUMBER CAMPS-

1000
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:24,200
OH, NO! KAY WOULDN'T
HAVE HIM AROUND.

1001
00:49:24,267 --> 00:49:25,667
HE'S BEEN IN JAIL
A COUPLE OF TIMES

1002
00:49:25,734 --> 00:49:27,033
FOR SETTING FIRES.

1003
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,534
SOME TIME BACK, I HEARD

1004
00:49:28,601 --> 00:49:30,534
OF A GIRL IN BARNESVILLE

1005
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:32,367
THAT WANTED TO HIRE OUT.

1006
00:49:32,434 --> 00:49:33,834
OH, I FORGOT.

1007
00:49:33,901 --> 00:49:35,367
SHE JUST HAD AN OPERATION.

1008
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:36,534
SHE DID? TELL ME
ALL ABOUT IT.

1009
00:49:36,601 --> 00:49:38,033
WAS IT BAD?

1010
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,501
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN

1011
00:49:39,567 --> 00:49:40,534
THE SIZE OF THE STONES

1012
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:41,534
THEY TOOK OUT OF HER.

1013
00:49:41,601 --> 00:49:42,734
YOU DON'T SAY!

1014
00:49:42,801 --> 00:49:45,033
WHAT DOCTOR
DID SHE HAVE?

1015
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,534
COME ON. PUT SOME BEEF INTO IT.

1016
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:51,534
BEEF? HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO GET ANY BEEF

1017
00:49:51,601 --> 00:49:53,567
WITH KAY COOKING NOTHING
BUT FARINA WITH LUMPS?

1018
00:49:53,634 --> 00:49:55,067
GIVE HER TIME.
SHE'LL LEARN.

1019
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:56,934
IN THE MEANTIME,
A FELLA COULD STARVE!

1020
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,067
UH-OH. THERE'S
OLD ICE-CREAM PUSS.

1021
00:49:59,133 --> 00:50:00,300
WONDER WHAT
HE WANTS.

1022
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:02,801
THAT ICE CREAM
SURE MELTED FAST

1023
00:50:02,868 --> 00:50:05,234
ON HIS HOT NECK,
DIDN'T IT? HA HA!

1024
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,534
HOWDY, MR. MEARS.

1025
00:50:06,601 --> 00:50:07,567
HI, MR. MEARS.

1026
00:50:07,634 --> 00:50:09,067
I WAS JUST
TELLING CHRIS,

1027
00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:11,067
THAT ICE CREAM
SURE MELTED FAST-

1028
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,334
WHAT DID I SAY?

1029
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,834
WANT TO SELL
YOUR PLACE, HAYWARD?

1030
00:50:14,901 --> 00:50:16,868
WHAT GAVE YOU
THAT IDEA?

1031
00:50:16,934 --> 00:50:20,100
OH, JUST THINKING
IS ALL.

1032
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:22,067
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
QUIT THINKING.

1033
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:23,234
IT'S NOT FOR SALE.

1034
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,400
MAYBE?

1035
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:26,067
NO "MAYBES."

1036
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:28,000
MAYBE.

1037
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:34,434
HUH.

1038
00:50:34,501 --> 00:50:36,434
YOU CAN SAY THAT
AGAIN, PARTNER.

1039
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:38,601
WELL, LET'S TAKE IT
AROUND THE CORNER.

1040
00:50:38,667 --> 00:50:40,200
HERE, YOU STAPLE IT.

1041
00:50:42,133 --> 00:50:43,300
BUZZARD.

1042
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,067
WAIT TILL I GET IT
STRETCHED.

1043
00:50:49,834 --> 00:50:52,033
CHRIS!
CHRIS, HELP!

1044
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,701
ORVIE, COME ON!

1045
00:51:01,367 --> 00:51:02,934
STOVE'S ON FIRE.

1046
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,067
NO. IT'S JUST
THAT DAMPER AGAIN.

1047
00:51:06,534 --> 00:51:08,067
CLOSES UP BY ITSELF
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

1048
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:10,067
WHENEVER IT DOES THAT, JUST
GIVE IT A COUPLE OF WHACKS-

1049
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,400
LIKE THAT, SEE?

1050
00:51:11,467 --> 00:51:12,567
OH.

1051
00:51:12,634 --> 00:51:14,067
THAT'LL OPEN IT UP.

1052
00:51:14,133 --> 00:51:15,734
SEE? IT'S DRAWING
BETTER ALREADY.

1053
00:51:15,801 --> 00:51:17,067
Orvie:
HELP! HELP!

1054
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:19,234
OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH ORVIE NOW?

1055
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:22,701
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN THERE?

1056
00:51:22,767 --> 00:51:25,567
CHRIS!

1057
00:51:33,734 --> 00:51:35,567
YOU SEE? IT'S EASY,
JUST LIKE PLAYING GOLF.

1058
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,601
KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN AND
YOUR EYE ON THE BUCKET.

1059
00:51:38,767 --> 00:51:40,100
OH, I'M SORRY, DAISY.

1060
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,767
I FORGOT TO GET MY
MANICURE THIS MORNING.

1061
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:45,601
SHE'S ABOUT EMPTY.
YOU CAN LET GO NOW.

1062
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:47,601
OOP! GOSH, I-

1063
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:49,100
AH, YOU'RE
A VETERAN.

1064
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:50,601
YEAH. OF WHICH WAR?

1065
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:53,701
HERE.

1066
00:51:57,067 --> 00:52:00,067
WELL, WHAT WAS MY TIMING ON THAT BUCKET?

1067
00:52:00,133 --> 00:52:01,067
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

1068
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:02,567
YOU FILLED IT,
DIDN'T YOU?

1069
00:52:02,634 --> 00:52:04,067
THANKS TO YOU.

1070
00:52:04,133 --> 00:52:06,133
OH, JEAN, THERE'S
SO MUCH TO LEARN.

1071
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,567
BRONCO BUSTING AND
BUTCHERING AND WATER DIVINING-

1072
00:52:09,634 --> 00:52:11,033
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

1073
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,133
WELL, AM I A RANCHER'S WIFE OR NOT?

1074
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,567
WHAT CHRIS NEEDS AROUND
HERE IS A FAIR HAND,

1075
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:18,234
NOT A LITTLE WIFE WHO'S
GOING TO SIT BY THE FIRESIDE

1076
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,567
WITH HER
PETIT POINT.

1077
00:52:19,634 --> 00:52:21,067
WHAT CHRIS NEEDS
IS YOU.

1078
00:52:21,133 --> 00:52:24,067
OH, YOU. EVERY TIME
I GET BOGGED DOWN,

1079
00:52:24,133 --> 00:52:26,067
YOU COME ALONG WITH
A WELL-TIMED REMARK.

1080
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:28,767
CHRIS WAS A FOOL
NOT TO MARRY YOU.

1081
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:30,567
A GUY USUALLY HAS TO
BE IN LOVE WITH A GAL

1082
00:52:30,634 --> 00:52:32,033
BEFORE HE ASKS HER
TO MARRY HIM.

1083
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,100
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
PUT POISON IN MY SOUP?

1084
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:37,601
DON'T THINK
I WASN'T TEMPTED

1085
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:39,734
TILL I'D KNOWN YOU
ABOUT 5 MINUTES.

1086
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:41,601
ALL RIGHT, NOW LET'S SEE
YOU CUT OUT YOUR HORSE.

1087
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:42,601
OK.

1088
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:44,100
NICE BIG LOOP.

1089
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:45,100
ALL RIGHT.

1090
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:46,067
OPEN.

1091
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:48,434
ALL RIGHT. WHICH ONE
WOULD YOU LIKE?

1092
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:49,667
TAKE IT EASY.

1093
00:52:53,267 --> 00:52:55,033
Jean: THAT'S THE GIRL!
RIGHT ON THE NOSE.

1094
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,033
WHOA!

1095
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,501
HELP!

1096
00:52:57,567 --> 00:52:58,901
AAH!

1097
00:53:03,067 --> 00:53:05,400
WHAT HAPPENED?

1098
00:53:05,467 --> 00:53:06,968
YOU FORGOT ONE
SMALL DETAIL-

1099
00:53:07,067 --> 00:53:09,067
TO LET GO
OF THE ROPE.

1100
00:53:09,133 --> 00:53:10,567
OH, NO!

1101
00:53:11,968 --> 00:53:13,434
OH. OH!

1102
00:53:32,234 --> 00:53:33,601
COOKBOOK. COOKBOOK.

1103
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:39,033
POT ROAST.

1104
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,934
"FISH... "

1105
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,400
"SOUP... "

1106
00:53:52,601 --> 00:53:54,834
"ONCE YOU FIND YOUR GUY."

1107
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:56,834
HMM.

1108
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:04,534
PORG. OH, PORG,
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

1109
00:54:04,601 --> 00:54:07,501
4 MONTHS AROUND HERE
WOULD DO THAT TO YOU-

1110
00:54:07,567 --> 00:54:08,968
OR ME EITHER?

1111
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,534
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1112
00:54:16,634 --> 00:54:17,868
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1113
00:54:25,734 --> 00:54:27,601
NO!

1114
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:36,567
WELL, NOBODY CAN SAY THERE'S A
CASTE SYSTEM ON THIS RANCH, ANYWAY.

1115
00:54:36,634 --> 00:54:39,033
I HOPE YOU CAN
SUPPORT THEM.

1116
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,033
OH, MY BISCUITS!

1117
00:54:59,334 --> 00:55:02,033
WHAT DID I DO WRONG
THIS TIME?

1118
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,701
THIS BOOK CAN'T BE RIGHT.

1119
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,033
OH... OH!

1120
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,067
OH, MY WASH!

1121
00:55:42,501 --> 00:55:44,300
DANDY!

1122
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,501
SUCH A PLACE...

1123
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:54,968
DUST AND DIRT.

1124
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,234
OH.

1125
00:56:21,801 --> 00:56:24,300
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

1126
00:56:25,968 --> 00:56:27,734
OOH!

1127
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:39,267
NO.

1128
00:56:59,067 --> 00:57:01,200
CLOSE THAT DOOR!

1129
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:04,801
NO!

1130
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:06,567
YES.

1131
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:08,701
GIVE ME A HAND.

1132
00:57:08,767 --> 00:57:11,334
HERE, HELP ME.
IF YOU'LL TAKE HOLD OF-

1133
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,734
OH, GRAB THAT WINDOW.

1134
00:57:12,801 --> 00:57:14,400
CAN'T YOU EVEN
SAY HELLO?

1135
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:16,501
DON'T TELL ME YOU WERE BLOWN
ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK.

1136
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:18,000
JUST FROM THE DEPOT.

1137
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,467
THAT'S RIGHT.
LET'S GRAB THIS ONE.

1138
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:22,300
I HOPE THE ROOF
IS NAILED ON TIGHT.

1139
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:23,734
OW!

1140
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:25,868
OH, I'M SORRY.

1141
00:57:25,934 --> 00:57:27,400
OH...

1142
00:57:27,467 --> 00:57:30,801
BABY, YOU LOOK LIKE A
BAD REVIEW COME TO LIFE.

1143
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:32,200
OH...

1144
00:57:32,267 --> 00:57:35,033
OH, JED.

1145
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:38,467
OH, I AM GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

1146
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:44,968
WELL, THE GUY WHO
THOUGHT HE'D GET SCALPED

1147
00:57:45,033 --> 00:57:48,434
IF HE TRAVELED
WEST OF TIMES SQUARE.

1148
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:52,000
HA HA!
ALL IS FORGIVEN?

1149
00:57:52,067 --> 00:57:54,000
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

1150
00:57:54,067 --> 00:57:58,567
DON'T TELL ME YOU CAME ALL THE
WAY OUT HERE JUST TO GET A LAUGH.

1151
00:57:58,634 --> 00:58:00,934
UH-UH. I CAME TO
TAKE YOU BACK WITH ME.

1152
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
YOU WHAT?

1153
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:04,000
HOW LONG BEFORE
YOU CAN BE PACKED?

1154
00:58:04,067 --> 00:58:05,234
WELL, HEY...

1155
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,334
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

1156
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,601
WE WERE IN BUSINESS
TOGETHER, TOO, REMEMBER?

1157
00:58:08,667 --> 00:58:10,067
YES, I REMEMBER.

1158
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:13,033
THAT GUY I TEAMED UP WITH
AFTER YOU LEFT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

1159
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,367
THE SCORE STINKS-

1160
00:58:15,434 --> 00:58:17,767
NONE OF THAT
KAY KINGSLEY SPARKLE.

1161
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:20,033
THE SHOW WILL DIE
ON ITS FEET.

1162
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,033
OH, JED. HA HA!

1163
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,534
OH, YOU'RE CONFUSING ME
WITH SOME OTHER CHICK.

1164
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:29,534
MRS. CHRIS HAYWARD.
I ALREADY HAVE A JOB.

1165
00:58:29,601 --> 00:58:31,033
WHAT A JOB.

1166
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,334
AND WHAT DOES IT
PAY YOU?

1167
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,901
OOH!

1168
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,968
NOTHING YOU CAN SEE, JED.

1169
00:58:39,033 --> 00:58:40,934
DON'T THEY USE MONEY
OUT HERE?

1170
00:58:41,033 --> 00:58:42,701
WHY, WITH WHAT YOU'D
MAKE IN THIS NEW SHOW,

1171
00:58:42,767 --> 00:58:44,467
YOU COULD BUY CATTLE WITH
GOLD RINGS IN THEIR NOSES.

1172
00:58:44,534 --> 00:58:48,100
WELL, NOW, WHO WANTS
CATTLE WITH GOLD-

1173
00:58:52,234 --> 00:58:53,567
WATER...

1174
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:55,901
WHAT WAS THAT?
WATER?

1175
00:58:55,968 --> 00:58:58,300
I COULD BUY US A PLACE
WITH PLENTY OF WATER.

1176
00:58:58,367 --> 00:59:01,133
DON'T TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T
GOT WATER OUT HERE.

1177
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,667
NOT ENOUGH FOR
WHAT WE'RE PLANNING.

1178
00:59:04,734 --> 00:59:09,234
YEAH. I COULD BUY US A PLACE
RUNNING OVER WITH IT.

1179
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,968
A FEW WEEKS' WORK
WITH ME IN NEW YORK,

1180
00:59:11,033 --> 00:59:13,434
AND YOU CAN HAVE YOUR LITTLE
DOGIES GUZZLING CHAMPAGNE.

1181
00:59:22,067 --> 00:59:24,300
IT MIGHT ONLY TAKE
A FEW WEEKS, HUH?

1182
00:59:24,367 --> 00:59:27,667
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO KNOCK
IT OFF IN LESS THAN THAT.

1183
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:30,100
YEAH.

1184
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:34,501
I... I THINK CHRIS
WOULD UNDERSTAND.

1185
00:59:34,567 --> 00:59:36,367
HE WOULDN'T WORRY.

1186
00:59:36,434 --> 00:59:38,801
HE KNOWS I'VE GOT NEW
YORK OUT OF MY SYSTEM.

1187
00:59:53,133 --> 00:59:54,400
DADDY! DADDY!

1188
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:56,834
HAVEN'T GOT TIME TO TALK
TO YOU NOW, KIDS.

1189
00:59:56,901 --> 00:59:58,667
BUT THIS IS
VERY IMPORTANT.

1190
00:59:58,734 --> 01:00:00,467
WHAT'LL WE DO?

1191
01:00:00,534 --> 01:00:02,834
BETTER GET BACK
AND WATCH THEM.

1192
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,567
WELL,
THINK IT OVER, KAY.

1193
01:00:05,634 --> 01:00:09,033
I'LL BE AT THE JUNIPER JUNCTION HOTEL.

1194
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,200
NO, NO. YOU WAIT
JUST RIGHT HERE.

1195
01:00:11,267 --> 01:00:12,934
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME
TELL CHRIS.

1196
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,534
NO, NO,
YOU DON'T NEED ME.

1197
01:00:15,601 --> 01:00:18,934
YOU CAN HANDLE IT MUCH
BETTER BY YOURSELF.

1198
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,667
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

1199
01:00:21,734 --> 01:00:24,334
I'LL TELEPHONE YOU AS SOON
AS I'VE BROKEN THE NEWS.

1200
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,400
NOW YOU'RE BEING
PRACTICAL.

1201
01:00:26,467 --> 01:00:28,267
OH...

1202
01:00:30,067 --> 01:00:31,601
IT'S BETTER
THAN IT WAS.

1203
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:34,100
GOOD-BYE.

1204
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:37,801
YEAH, GEE..
NEW YORK.

1205
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,234
OH, I DON'T THINK
CHRIS WOULD OBJECT.

1206
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,434
GOSH, IT MAY GET
THAT MEARS OFF HIS NECK.

1207
01:00:49,033 --> 01:00:51,667
GEE, KAY, WE DON'T
WANT TO GO TO BED.

1208
01:00:51,734 --> 01:00:54,033
WE WANT TO STAY UP
AND SEE DADDY.

1209
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,567
YOU CAN SEE DADDY
IN THE MORNING.

1210
01:00:55,634 --> 01:00:57,067
YOU BOTH LOOK
A LITTLE TIRED,

1211
01:00:57,133 --> 01:00:59,067
AND DADDY SAID
HE MIGHT BE LATE.

1212
01:00:59,133 --> 01:01:01,033
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WHEN
THE BOYS GET TOGETHER

1213
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:04,033
ON THOSE STRICTLY
MALE ENTERPRISES.

1214
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,567
WORK, THEY CALL IT.

1215
01:01:05,634 --> 01:01:07,534
COME ON, NOW.
GET UNDRESSED.

1216
01:01:07,601 --> 01:01:09,567
HURRY UP,
AND I'LL COME BACK

1217
01:01:09,634 --> 01:01:12,267
AND KISS YOU GOOD NIGHT
IN A MINUTE. HURRY UP.

1218
01:01:13,634 --> 01:01:15,234
SHOOT.

1219
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:20,934
AW, GEE.

1220
01:01:58,767 --> 01:02:02,067
CHRIS,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1221
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:05,467
YEAH, I'M ALL RIGHT.
I'M JUST BUSHED, THAT'S ALL.

1222
01:02:19,868 --> 01:02:22,400
CHRIS, YOU'RE HURT.

1223
01:02:22,467 --> 01:02:25,734
NO. WE JUST
BUTCHERED A BEEF.

1224
01:02:25,801 --> 01:02:27,434
OH.

1225
01:02:36,968 --> 01:02:38,300
THANKS.

1226
01:02:47,167 --> 01:02:52,267
OH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
HAVING FUN FOR YOURSELF.

1227
01:02:52,334 --> 01:02:54,534
HAVING FUN, HUH?

1228
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:58,267
SORT OF A PRIVATE RODEO.

1229
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,601
DARLING, YOU ARE TIRED...

1230
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:05,934
TERRIBLY TIRED.

1231
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:10,367
AND SUCH A MESS.

1232
01:03:10,434 --> 01:03:12,567
YEAH, I GUESS I AM.

1233
01:03:12,634 --> 01:03:16,000
CHRIS, IT NEVER USED TO GET
TO YOU LIKE THIS IN NEW YORK-

1234
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:17,801
ALL THE RIDING
AND BULLDOGGING.

1235
01:03:17,868 --> 01:03:22,934
SILK SHIRT AND THE PRIZE
MONEY AND THE FOLKS CHEERING.

1236
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
THAT WAS THE CREAM, BABY.

1237
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,567
TODAY WAS THE BREAD
AND BUTTER.

1238
01:03:27,634 --> 01:03:30,367
CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE,
NO REST BETWEEN SHOWS.

1239
01:03:30,434 --> 01:03:32,033
OH...

1240
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,534
DON'T LOOK SO BIG-EYED.
I'M JUST PLAIN OLD TIRED.

1241
01:03:35,601 --> 01:03:39,567
ANY RANCHER WORTH HIS SALT
GETS THIS WAY ONCE IN A WHILE.

1242
01:03:41,133 --> 01:03:43,100
OH, COME ON.
GET CLEANED UP.

1243
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:45,601
JUST LET ME SIT HERE
A MINUTE, HUH?

1244
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:48,868
NO. NOW, COME ON. GET A
NICE, HOT BATH AND SOME FOOD,

1245
01:03:48,934 --> 01:03:50,868
AND YOU'LL BE
GOOD AS NEW.

1246
01:03:50,934 --> 01:03:52,467
OK.

1247
01:03:52,534 --> 01:03:53,734
HURRY UP.

1248
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,234
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
BUCKSHOT?

1249
01:03:59,934 --> 01:04:03,033
THE HOUSE USED TO BE
DARK WHEN I'D GET HOME.

1250
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,534
NIGHTS LIKE THIS,
I'D FALL INTO BED

1251
01:04:05,601 --> 01:04:08,367
WITH MY CLOTHES ON
AND MY BELLY EMPTY.

1252
01:04:08,434 --> 01:04:10,534
BUT NOW I...

1253
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:12,968
YOU'RE
REALLY SOMETHING.

1254
01:04:13,033 --> 01:04:14,534
I'M LIVING NOW.

1255
01:04:17,067 --> 01:04:19,267
BOY,
I'M REALLY LIVING.

1256
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,267
GIVE ME THE HOTEL,
WILL YOU, TESS?

1257
01:04:50,334 --> 01:04:52,667
DID KAY TELL THIS
JED FELLA SHE'D-

1258
01:04:52,734 --> 01:04:54,868
WELL, SHE DIDN'T SAY
SHE WOULDN'T.

1259
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:58,567
BUT YOU'LL ASK KAY NOT
TO GO, WON'T YOU, DADDY?

1260
01:04:58,634 --> 01:05:01,367
SHE WON'T
IF YOU SAY NOT TO.

1261
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:04,000
WELL, SPROUTS, THAT'S KIND OF UP TO KAY

1262
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:06,534
TO DECIDE
FOR HERSELF.

1263
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:10,234
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH TO
ANSWER FOR ALREADY.

1264
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:13,000
YOU SEE, IT'S LIKE
WE CAUGHT A LARK

1265
01:05:13,067 --> 01:05:16,901
AND TRIED TO MAKE A
BARN SWALLOW OUT OF IT.

1266
01:05:16,968 --> 01:05:20,834
BUT-BUT I DON'T WANT
KAY TO GO, DADDY.

1267
01:05:20,901 --> 01:05:23,067
WHAT WILL WE DO
WITHOUT HER?

1268
01:05:23,133 --> 01:05:25,868
MY GUESS IS
YOU'D NEVER WASH YOUR EARS.

1269
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:32,267
IF YOU THINK I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
A BREAK LIKE THAT, YOU'RE CRAZY.

1270
01:05:33,501 --> 01:05:35,067
KAY.

1271
01:05:35,133 --> 01:05:38,567
OH, CHRIS. OH...

1272
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:40,934
DON'T EVER DO THAT
TO ME AGAIN, BABY.

1273
01:05:43,334 --> 01:05:44,534
HELLO? HELLO?

1274
01:05:44,601 --> 01:05:46,901
IS THIS STILL YOU,
THAT JED PERSON?

1275
01:05:46,968 --> 01:05:49,067
BECAUSE IF IT IS,
KAY GAVE YOU HER ANSWER,

1276
01:05:49,133 --> 01:05:51,033
AND IF YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU,

1277
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,501
YOU'LL JUST SCAT.

1278
01:05:52,567 --> 01:05:54,033
THE IDEA!

1279
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,000
MAYBE A LITTLE TAR
AND FEATHERS WOULD DO IT.

1280
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:58,000
AND RIDE OUT
OF TOWN ON A RAIL.

1281
01:05:58,067 --> 01:05:59,801
MY MAN WOULD
LEND A HAND,

1282
01:05:59,868 --> 01:06:01,968
BUT HIS BACK'S STARTING TO HURT AGAIN.

1283
01:06:02,033 --> 01:06:03,501
IT IS?

1284
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:06,534
MAYBE IT'S LIKE THAT RHEUMATISM
I HAD IN MY NECK LAST-

1285
01:06:24,467 --> 01:06:25,601
YOU'LL DO, COWBOY.

1286
01:06:25,667 --> 01:06:27,801
YOU'RE PRETTY FAIR
YOURSELF, COWBOY.

1287
01:06:27,868 --> 01:06:29,234
I'M GOING INTO TOWN
WITH JEAN.

1288
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,067
PICK ME UP A COUPLE OF
SUITS OF UNDERWEAR, WILL YOU?

1289
01:06:31,133 --> 01:06:32,067
SIZE, UH...

1290
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:34,067
OH, I KNOW THE SIZE.

1291
01:06:34,133 --> 01:06:35,901
HEY, CHRIS!

1292
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:40,701
WHAT'S UP?

1293
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,067
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

1294
01:06:42,133 --> 01:06:44,033
FERN SPRINGS IS JUST
AS DRY AS A BONE.

1295
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,200
DRY?

1296
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:46,567
IT JUST AIN'T ANYMORE.

1297
01:06:46,634 --> 01:06:47,734
IT CAN'T BE.

1298
01:06:47,801 --> 01:06:49,400
IT IS. THAT'S WHAT I SAID,

1299
01:06:49,467 --> 01:06:51,734
BUT YOU'LL GET THE SURPRISE OF YOUR LIFE

1300
01:06:51,801 --> 01:06:53,667
WHEN YOU GET
OUT THERE.

1301
01:06:58,734 --> 01:07:02,000
LOOK. THERE AIN'T ENOUGH LEFT
TO WET A JAYBIRD'S WHISTLE.

1302
01:07:02,067 --> 01:07:05,000
IF MEARS DOESN'T LET ME HAVE
MORE WATER, I'M OUT OF BUSINESS.

1303
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:07,501
I'M GOING TO TALK TO HIM, AND
THIS TIME HE'S GOING TO LISTEN.

1304
01:07:07,567 --> 01:07:09,167
TAKE YOUR SHOOTING IRON
WITH YOU.

1305
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:11,334
THERE AIN'T NOTHING THAT'LL
MAKE A MAN HEAR BETTER

1306
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,501
THAN TO PLUG UP
HIS EAR WITH A.45.

1307
01:07:15,934 --> 01:07:18,267
OUT OF THE BLUE HE SAYS,
"YOU'LL DO, COWBOY."

1308
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,000
THOUGH COMING FROM HIM
THAT CAN ONLY MEAN

1309
01:07:20,067 --> 01:07:22,767
THAT AT LAST HE THINKS I'M A
PRETTY FAIR HAND AROUND THE PLACE,

1310
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:24,200
THANKS TO YOU.

1311
01:07:24,267 --> 01:07:26,400
YOU KNOW, I MAY ASK YOU
TO WRITE ME A TESTIMONIAL-

1312
01:07:26,467 --> 01:07:30,033
"HOW TO LEARN TO BECOME A
RANCH WOMAN IN 6 EASY LESSONS."

1313
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,534
YOU MEAN 60
NOT-SO-EASY LESSONS

1314
01:07:32,601 --> 01:07:35,801
AND 60 BOTTLES
OF LINIMENT.

1315
01:07:35,868 --> 01:07:39,200
UH-OH.
LAUGHING BOY.

1316
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,067
THANK YOU,
MRS. JONES.

1317
01:07:45,133 --> 01:07:47,634
HOWDY, MR. MEARS. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

1318
01:07:47,701 --> 01:07:48,868
HALTERS.

1319
01:07:48,934 --> 01:07:50,300
MM-HMM, HALTERS.

1320
01:07:50,367 --> 01:07:54,334
HOW IS RED BOY?

1321
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,501
LIKE HE WAS THAT TIME HE BROKE
LOOSE AND RUN OFF IN THE HILLS.

1322
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,834
MIGHT BE HIS DIET.

1323
01:07:58,901 --> 01:08:01,300
YOU MIGHT TRY THIS NEW ELIXIR
- VERY GOOD STUFF.

1324
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:03,467
I'M GOING TO HAVE DOC HENRY
LOOK AT HIM. I'LL TAKE THIS.

1325
01:08:03,534 --> 01:08:04,701
DOC'S GOOD.

1326
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,234
POW, PARTNER.

1327
01:08:21,734 --> 01:08:25,434
HI, OLD-TIMER. WHAT'S COOKING
HOME ON THE RANGE, PARD?

1328
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:26,534
ARE THEM YOUR BRATS?

1329
01:08:26,601 --> 01:08:27,701
YEAH.
AIN'T THEY SOMETHING?

1330
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,200
BEEN ACTING
LIKE THAT FOR DAYS.

1331
01:08:31,267 --> 01:08:33,033
JUST THINK.
WE HARDLY GOT HERE,

1332
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,701
AND ALREADY THEY'RE
LIKE THEY WAS BORN

1333
01:08:34,767 --> 01:08:36,334
TO THE BIG,
OPEN SPACES.

1334
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,901
HEY, MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE US
SOME INFORMATION.

1335
01:08:38,968 --> 01:08:40,868
WE SEEM TO BE
RIDING WILD.

1336
01:08:40,934 --> 01:08:42,534
GET YOUR INFORMATION
FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.

1337
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:44,267
AND WHO'S PAYING
FOR THIS DAMAGE?

1338
01:08:44,334 --> 01:08:47,801
THESE FELLAS ARE AS FRIENDLY
AS A BOBCAT WITH HIVES.

1339
01:08:47,868 --> 01:08:50,033
WILL $100
TAKE CARE OF IT?

1340
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,434
I HOPE SO. NOW, WHAT
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

1341
01:08:52,501 --> 01:08:54,968
WHERE WE'RE AIMING FOR
IS PEYTON BRIGGS' PLACE.

1342
01:08:55,033 --> 01:08:57,000
YEAH, THE DUDE
RANCH, YOU KNOW?

1343
01:08:57,067 --> 01:08:59,467
WELL, IT'S
14 MILES EAST...

1344
01:08:59,534 --> 01:09:01,634
PEYTON BRIGGS.

1345
01:09:01,701 --> 01:09:06,501
AND THEN IT'S ABOUT A LOOK
AND A HALF STRAIGHT AHEAD.

1346
01:09:07,567 --> 01:09:09,534
OH, CLEAR AS
A PRAIRIE DOG'S EYE.

1347
01:09:09,601 --> 01:09:13,300
JEAN, DON'T LET MEARS GET
AWAY. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1348
01:09:13,367 --> 01:09:16,033
ROPING EVERY
MORNING AND WHOOPEE AT NIGHT.

1349
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,767
WELL, SO LONG,
OLD-TIMER!

1350
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:19,534
DON'T ROPE
ANY WOODEN STEERS.

1351
01:09:19,601 --> 01:09:22,367
COME ON, COWHANDS.
TIME TO HIT THE TRAIL.

1352
01:09:25,234 --> 01:09:26,801
BLAMED DUDES.

1353
01:09:26,868 --> 01:09:28,634
CIGAR COWBOYS.

1354
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,634
OH, MR. MEARS,

1355
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:35,033
I COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING
YOU TELLING MR. KLINGER

1356
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,801
ABOUT HOW FIDGETY RED BOY'S BEEN LATELY.

1357
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:39,567
I HAD THE SAME TROUBLE WITH
ONE OF MY VERY BEST MILKERS,

1358
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:43,367
AND I PUT SULFUR MOLASSES IN HER BRAN,
AND SHE JUST QUIETED DOWN RIGHT AWAY.

1359
01:09:43,434 --> 01:09:44,567
I'LL TRY IT
SOMETIME.

1360
01:09:44,634 --> 01:09:46,267
NOW, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
YOU GET THE RIGHT MIXTURE.

1361
01:09:46,334 --> 01:09:47,767
THAT'S TWO PARTS
OF MOLASSES

1362
01:09:47,834 --> 01:09:50,167
AND ONE PART OF SULFUR
TO TWO PACKS OF BRAN.

1363
01:09:50,234 --> 01:09:51,534
OH, JEAN.

1364
01:09:51,601 --> 01:09:53,701
I'M SO GLAD I FOUND YOU.
HELLO, MR. MEARS.

1365
01:09:53,767 --> 01:09:55,067
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1366
01:09:55,133 --> 01:09:56,567
WHAT?

1367
01:09:56,634 --> 01:09:57,801
I SAW THOSE DUDES AGAIN, AND
THEY WANT TO BUY OUR RANCH.

1368
01:09:57,868 --> 01:09:58,868
YOU DON'T SAY!

1369
01:09:58,934 --> 01:10:00,801
UH-HUH. THEY'RE FRIENDS
OF PEYTON BRIGGS.

1370
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:02,167
ARE YOU GOING TO
SELL TO THEM?

1371
01:10:02,234 --> 01:10:05,033
WHY NOT? THE PLACE IS
ABOUT AS BIG AS IT CAN GET

1372
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,434
WITH THE AMOUNT
OF WATER WE HAVE,

1373
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:08,067
AND IT'S JUST
WHAT THEY WANT.

1374
01:10:08,133 --> 01:10:09,667
HOLD ON,
MRS. HAYWARD.

1375
01:10:09,734 --> 01:10:11,200
I OFFERED TO BUY
YOUR PLACE.

1376
01:10:11,267 --> 01:10:13,701
OH, YOU-YES, I KNOW
YOU DID, MR. MEARS.

1377
01:10:13,767 --> 01:10:16,400
BUT DUDES PAY
AWFULLY GOOD MONEY,

1378
01:10:16,467 --> 01:10:18,534
REALLY MUCH MORE
THAN IT'S WORTH.

1379
01:10:18,601 --> 01:10:21,067
YOU WOULDN'T SELL OUT TO
THE LIKES OF THEM, WOULD YOU?

1380
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:23,767
WHAT CAN WE DO IF WE
CAN'T GET ANY MORE WATER?

1381
01:10:23,834 --> 01:10:25,834
AND THEY'RE
THE NICEST PEOPLE,

1382
01:10:25,901 --> 01:10:27,968
NOT OLD
STICK-IN-THE-MUDS LIKE US.

1383
01:10:28,033 --> 01:10:30,200
THEY'LL WHOOP IT UP
FROM DUSK TO DAWN-

1384
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:31,601
WILD WEST WHOOPEE.

1385
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:32,834
YOU'LL START LIVING.

1386
01:10:32,901 --> 01:10:35,334
I AIN'T GONNA HAVE THEM DUDES OUT THERE!

1387
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,434
WELL, THEN, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE YOUR CHOICE.

1388
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:43,601
IT'S DUDES FOR YOU
OR WATER FOR US.

1389
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:46,567
ALL RIGHT. WATER.

1390
01:10:46,634 --> 01:10:49,300
WELL, THEY'RE GOING TO BE
MIGHTY DISAPPOINTED,

1391
01:10:49,367 --> 01:10:50,634
BUT ALL RIGHT.

1392
01:10:50,701 --> 01:10:51,801
YOU HEARD HIM.

1393
01:10:51,868 --> 01:10:52,934
YES.

1394
01:10:55,133 --> 01:10:56,534
MEARS, I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

1395
01:10:56,601 --> 01:10:57,567
CHRIS...

1396
01:10:57,634 --> 01:10:59,067
YOU STAY OUT OF THIS.

1397
01:10:59,133 --> 01:11:01,067
I'M NOT ASKING YOU THIS
TIME. I'M TELLING YOU.

1398
01:11:01,133 --> 01:11:03,067
I NEED WATER, AND I NEED
IT BAD, AND I AIM TO GET IT.

1399
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:04,200
NOT TILL FRIDAY.

1400
01:11:04,267 --> 01:11:05,667
THIS IS BETWEEN
MEARS AND ME.

1401
01:11:05,734 --> 01:11:08,033
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF
PERSONAL LIKES OR DISLIKES-

1402
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,567
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

1403
01:11:09,634 --> 01:11:11,167
I SAID IT WOULDN'T
BE TILL FRIDAY.

1404
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:13,534
IT'LL TAKE ME A COUPLE OF DAYS
TO GET THE PAPERS DRAWN UP.

1405
01:11:13,601 --> 01:11:15,400
I'LL BRING THEM
OVER TO YOU THEN.

1406
01:11:15,467 --> 01:11:17,067
YOU MEAN
WE GET THE WATER?

1407
01:11:17,133 --> 01:11:20,033
STARTING FRIDAY. I KNOW WHEN I'M LICKED.

1408
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:24,300
WELL, THAT'S THE WAY
TO HANDLE THAT CHARACTER.

1409
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:26,133
WASN'T CHRIS
WONDERFUL?

1410
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,601
OH, ESPECIALLY
WONDERFUL.

1411
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:30,334
IT WAS NOTHING. I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT EASY.

1412
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,400
DO YOU MIND IF I RIDE HOME WITH CHRIS?

1413
01:11:32,467 --> 01:11:33,601
NO, NO.

1414
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:35,100
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
TO TELL THE COWS.

1415
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,267
SEE YOU LATER.

1416
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:37,534
BYE.

1417
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,067
YOU KNOW, BUCKSHOT,
I DON'T GET IT.

1418
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:45,067
ALL I SAID WAS, "MEARS,
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU."

1419
01:11:45,133 --> 01:11:47,067
I KNOW IT. I WAS STANDING
RIGHT THERE WHEN YOU SAID IT.

1420
01:11:47,133 --> 01:11:48,767
AND THEN I SAID, "YOU STAY OUT OF THIS."

1421
01:11:48,834 --> 01:11:50,400
UH-HUH, YOU SURE DID.

1422
01:11:50,467 --> 01:11:51,934
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT
YOUR FEELINGS, BUT-

1423
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,334
OH, YOU DIDN'T.

1424
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,033
THE CHIPS
WERE DOWN, AND...

1425
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,701
I STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

1426
01:11:56,767 --> 01:11:58,400
HE GAVE IN
SO EASILY.

1427
01:11:58,467 --> 01:12:01,834
WELL, YOU HAD HIM
BACKED AGAINST THE WALL.

1428
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:05,000
YOU WERE SO DYNAMIC.

1429
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:07,100
YEAH.

1430
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,868
WELL, IT'S STILL OURS,

1431
01:12:13,934 --> 01:12:16,200
BUT WE CAME AWFUL CLOSE TO
HAVING TO GIVE THE WHOLE THING UP.

1432
01:12:16,267 --> 01:12:17,601
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1433
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:20,400
I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU,
BUT FERN SPRING DRIED UP ON US-

1434
01:12:20,467 --> 01:12:22,033
OUR MAIN SOURCE OF WATER.

1435
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,634
CHRIS, I DIDN'T
KNOW THAT.

1436
01:12:24,701 --> 01:12:26,067
WELL, WHAT IF
I HADN'T SUP-

1437
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:29,534
WELL, SUPPOSE MEARS
HADN'T DECIDED TO GIVE IN?

1438
01:12:29,601 --> 01:12:33,033
WE JUST COULDN'T GET BY ON
THE WATER HE'S GIVING US NOW.

1439
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,033
WELL, WHAT-

1440
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,100
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'D HAVE DONE.

1441
01:12:35,167 --> 01:12:36,601
OH, GEE.

1442
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:39,367
YOU KNOW, BUCKSHOT, I GUESS
A LOT OF FOLKS MIGHT NOT THINK

1443
01:12:39,434 --> 01:12:41,901
COUGAR ROCK IS THE
BEST RANCH IN THE WORLD,

1444
01:12:41,968 --> 01:12:43,667
BUT WHEN YOU BUILD
A PLACE UP FROM SCRATCH

1445
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:46,100
AND KIND OF IRRIGATED IT
WITH YOUR OWN SWEAT,

1446
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:48,033
WELL, YOU GET
A FEELING ABOUT IT.

1447
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,367
I'VE ALWAYS KIND OF FELT
LIKE IT WAS ALIVE-

1448
01:12:50,434 --> 01:12:52,834
NOT JUST DIRT
AND ROCK AND SCRUB,

1449
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:55,000
BUT LIKE A REAL PERSON
THAT'S NEVER HAD A BREAK,

1450
01:12:55,067 --> 01:12:56,400
AND IT'S WAITING
TO HIT ITS STRIDE.

1451
01:12:56,467 --> 01:12:59,901
I KIND OF SOUND LIKE A
REAL-ESTATE SALESMAN, DON'T I?

1452
01:12:59,968 --> 01:13:01,601
YOU SOLD ME, MISTER.

1453
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:04,467
WELL, ANYWAY, BUCKSHOT,
WE'RE ON OUR WAY NOW.

1454
01:13:04,534 --> 01:13:06,968
YOU KNOW, CHRIS, IF WE
GET ALL THE WATER WE NEED,

1455
01:13:07,033 --> 01:13:09,100
WE'LL BUY CATTLE UNTIL
THESE BARNS BULGE.

1456
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:11,067
WE'LL OWN HALF THE STATE
BEFORE WE'RE THROUGH.

1457
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:12,033
YEAH.

1458
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,501
MAYBE
JUST A QUARTER.

1459
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:16,267
AND WE'LL BUY BULLS
THAT WILL OUT-BULL THE BULL

1460
01:13:16,334 --> 01:13:17,968
THAT OUT-BULLED
MEARS' BULL.

1461
01:13:18,033 --> 01:13:21,000
YEAH, BRIDE OF
THE CATTLE KING, THAT'S ME.

1462
01:13:21,067 --> 01:13:22,067
HEY, QUEENIE?

1463
01:13:22,133 --> 01:13:23,067
WHAT?

1464
01:13:23,133 --> 01:13:24,934
HOW ABOUT DECLARING
A ROYAL HOLIDAY?

1465
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,033
THE BOYS ARE GOING ON A DEER HUNT.
WHY DON'T WE GO ALONG WITH THEM?

1466
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,167
SURE. OH, NO.

1467
01:13:28,234 --> 01:13:29,734
I PROMISED
TO TAKE THE KIDS-

1468
01:13:29,801 --> 01:13:32,634
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU. I SAW POKEY
IN TOWN. SHE WANTS TO COME BACK.

1469
01:13:32,701 --> 01:13:34,767
OF COURSE, IF YOU
DON'T WANT HER-

1470
01:13:34,834 --> 01:13:36,968
OH, CHRIS, OH!

1471
01:13:37,033 --> 01:13:40,067
OH, CHRIS, TELL HER SHE
CAN WEAR MY HATTIE CARNEGIES

1472
01:13:40,133 --> 01:13:42,300
ALL AT THE SAME TIME
IF SHE WANTS,

1473
01:13:42,367 --> 01:13:45,100
AND TELL HER I'LL RUN A WHOLE
TUBFUL OF PERFUME FOR HER.

1474
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:46,434
PERFUME, NOTHING.

1475
01:13:46,501 --> 01:13:49,033
YOU CAN FILL IT UP
WITH WATER NOW.

1476
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,300
OH!

1477
01:13:50,367 --> 01:13:51,934
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ON A
HUNTING TRIP, HAVE YOU?

1478
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,367
YOU'LL HAVE
A LOT OF FUN,

1479
01:13:53,434 --> 01:13:55,200
EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW
THE BACK END OF A SHOTGUN

1480
01:13:55,267 --> 01:13:57,000
FROM THE FRONT END.

1481
01:13:57,067 --> 01:13:58,434
OH, MY AIM'S
PRETTY GOOD.

1482
01:13:58,501 --> 01:13:59,501
PRETTY GOOD.

1483
01:13:59,567 --> 01:14:00,701
MINE, TOO.

1484
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:02,000
YOU LIKE IT?
OH, CHRIS.

1485
01:14:10,601 --> 01:14:12,534
WHAT TIME DO
WE HAVE TO GET UP

1486
01:14:12,601 --> 01:14:14,534
TO START AFTER
THESE DEER, DEAR?

1487
01:14:14,601 --> 01:14:16,067
WE'LL GET UP
AROUND 4:00.

1488
01:14:16,133 --> 01:14:18,067
OH.

1489
01:14:18,133 --> 01:14:20,000
WELL...

1490
01:14:20,067 --> 01:14:23,901
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THE REST OF YOU GALOOTS,

1491
01:14:23,968 --> 01:14:28,567
BUT I THINK
I'LL JUST HIT THE SACK.

1492
01:14:28,634 --> 01:14:29,567
NIGHT, KAY.

1493
01:14:29,634 --> 01:14:30,567
GOOD NIGHT.

1494
01:14:30,634 --> 01:14:32,133
GOOD NIGHT.

1495
01:14:34,133 --> 01:14:38,534
YEAH. 4:00 DOES COME
KIND OF EARLY.

1496
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:16,734
"BE BACK. HAVE BREAKFAST READY
FOR THE GANG AT 6:00."

1497
01:15:19,934 --> 01:15:23,100
WHAT A DIRTY TRICK.

1498
01:15:30,968 --> 01:15:35,033
"HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
ON A HUNTING TRIP?" HE SAYS.

1499
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:41,067
"NEVER CAMPED OUT OVERNIGHT,
HAVE YOU, BUCKSHOT?

1500
01:15:41,133 --> 01:15:43,934
YOU'LL JUST LOVE IT."

1501
01:15:46,801 --> 01:15:50,267
BROUGHT ME ALONG
TO COOK THEIR OLD BREAKFAST.

1502
01:15:51,601 --> 01:15:54,400
"WE'LL HAVE
A ROYAL HOLIDAY."

1503
01:15:56,100 --> 01:16:01,367
OK, BOYS, I'LL GIVE YOU
A ROYAL BREAKFAST.

1504
01:16:02,501 --> 01:16:05,267
FIRST, WE'LL
HAVE SOME COFFEE-

1505
01:16:05,334 --> 01:16:09,501
A LITTLE WATER,
A LOT OF COFFEE.

1506
01:16:09,567 --> 01:16:11,367
EGGSHELL...

1507
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,968
THERE'S SOMETHING
FOR YOUR BACK TEETH.

1508
01:16:24,634 --> 01:16:26,901
OH, OH! CHRIS!

1509
01:16:42,033 --> 01:16:45,000
IT'S A COUGAR.

1510
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:48,033
THAT'S WHAT IT IS,
A COUGAR.

1511
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,067
WHAT'LL I DO?

1512
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:24,400
OH, CHRIS!

1513
01:17:24,467 --> 01:17:25,734
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BUCKSHOT?

1514
01:17:25,801 --> 01:17:27,534
CHRIS, I GOT HIM.

1515
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:28,767
YOU GOT WHAT?

1516
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:30,033
HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE
IN THE BUSHES.

1517
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,033
I SNUCK UP ON HIM AND
SHOT HIM. WHAT A SHOT-BANG!

1518
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,701
AT FIRST I THOUGHT
I HEARD A SOUND...

1519
01:17:33,767 --> 01:17:35,133
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1520
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,734
A COUGAR TRIED
TO KILL ME.

1521
01:17:37,801 --> 01:17:40,400
I SHOT HIM. HE'S OVER IN THE BUSHES.

1522
01:17:40,467 --> 01:17:41,934
THIS I GOT TO SEE.

1523
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,434
YOU THOUGHT
I DIDN'T KNOW

1524
01:17:43,501 --> 01:17:46,400
THE BUZZLE END OF A
GUN FROM A MUTT, TOO.

1525
01:17:46,467 --> 01:17:48,234
HE'S RIGHT
OVER HERE.

1526
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,734
OH, I CAN'T LOOK.

1527
01:17:49,801 --> 01:17:51,334
WHAT DID HE DO,
JUST WALK INTO CAMP AND-

1528
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,901
AND HE WAS
SUCH A BIG ONE.

1529
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:54,334
KAY!

1530
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,000
IS HE STILL ALIVE?

1531
01:17:57,701 --> 01:17:59,367
RED BOY!

1532
01:18:19,801 --> 01:18:21,000
NO SOAP?

1533
01:18:21,067 --> 01:18:23,000
NO SOAP, NO WATER RIGHTS, NO NOTHING...

1534
01:18:23,067 --> 01:18:24,934
FROM HIM, THAT IS.

1535
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
FROM US, COUGAR ROCK RANCH
TO HEAL HIS ACHING HEART.

1536
01:18:29,067 --> 01:18:32,634
CHRIS, WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO MARRY SUCH A DOPE?

1537
01:18:32,701 --> 01:18:34,968
OH, FORGET IT.
WE'LL MAKE OUT.

1538
01:18:36,601 --> 01:18:38,601
I'VE WRECKED
EVERYTHING FOR YOU.

1539
01:18:38,667 --> 01:18:41,000
LOOK, THIS ISN'T THE
ONLY RANCH IN THE COUNTRY.

1540
01:18:41,067 --> 01:18:42,634
SO WE LOSE IT.

1541
01:18:42,701 --> 01:18:44,400
I'LL HIT THE RODEO
CIRCUIT AGAIN,

1542
01:18:44,467 --> 01:18:45,868
AND SOMEDAY WE'LL
GET ANOTHER PLACE,

1543
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:47,501
A BETTER ONE.

1544
01:18:47,567 --> 01:18:51,033
I'LL SEE TOM RIDDLEY AND ENTER
THE HAZELTON ROUNDUP NEXT MONTH.

1545
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:54,567
CHRIS, WHY DON'T
YOU CUSS ME OUT

1546
01:18:54,634 --> 01:18:56,968
OR GIVE ME
A POKE IN THE NOSE?

1547
01:18:57,033 --> 01:18:59,501
DON'T GET YOUR LEVI'S
IN AN UPROAR, BUCKSHOT.

1548
01:18:59,567 --> 01:19:02,968
ANYBODY CAN HAVE
A HUNTING ACCIDENT.

1549
01:19:03,033 --> 01:19:05,634
YOU KNOW, CHRIS, WHEN
JED WAS OUT HERE, HE SAID-

1550
01:19:05,701 --> 01:19:07,467
I KNOW WHAT HE SAID.

1551
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:11,000
INCIDENTALLY, THANKS FOR LETTING
ME THINK I WAS A BIG SHOT.

1552
01:19:11,067 --> 01:19:12,234
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1553
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,100
IN THE PLEASANT DISCUSSION
WITH MEARS ABOUT THE BULL,

1554
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:17,501
IT SORT OF CAME OUT THAT YOU AND I
WERE GOING TO SELL THE PLACE TO DUDES.

1555
01:19:17,567 --> 01:19:19,033
CHRIS, I WAS ONLY
TRYING-

1556
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:22,067
YEAH, I KNOW. LIKE YOU
SAID, I SURE WAS DYNAMIC.

1557
01:19:23,601 --> 01:19:25,501
I'M SORRY.

1558
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:28,033
I WON'T LET HIM
DO THIS.

1559
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:31,167
I WON'T LET THAT OLD BUZZARD
PICK YOUR BONES LIKE THIS.

1560
01:19:31,234 --> 01:19:33,133
HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO STOP HIM?

1561
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,601
BY GOING BACK TO NEW YORK AND
DOING THAT SHOW, THAT'S HOW.

1562
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:39,200
GET THIS THROUGH YOUR HEAD,
KAY. RANCHING'S MY BUSINESS.

1563
01:19:39,267 --> 01:19:41,200
ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH
THIS PLACE IS MY PROBLEM.

1564
01:19:41,267 --> 01:19:42,634
YOU KEEP OUT OF IT.

1565
01:19:42,701 --> 01:19:44,067
KEEP OUT OF IT?

1566
01:19:44,133 --> 01:19:46,634
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE LET ME FOOL
MEARS ABOUT THE DUDES, EITHER,

1567
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:48,100
BUT WE GOT THE WATER RIGHTS, DIDN'T WE?

1568
01:19:48,167 --> 01:19:49,567
YEAH, WE GOT THEM.

1569
01:19:49,634 --> 01:19:52,100
THEN YOU SHOT RED BOY, AND WE LOST THEM.

1570
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:54,567
SO YOU ARE HOLDING IT
AGAINST ME.

1571
01:19:54,634 --> 01:19:56,567
"ANYBODY CAN HAVE A
HUNTING ACCIDENT," HE SAYS.

1572
01:19:56,634 --> 01:19:57,901
WELL, THEY CAN,

1573
01:19:57,968 --> 01:20:00,367
AND I'M NOT HOLDING
IT AGAINST YOU.

1574
01:20:00,434 --> 01:20:02,868
OF COURSE,
YOU COULD HAVE LOOKED.

1575
01:20:02,934 --> 01:20:06,300
OH, FINE. NOW IT
BEGINS TO COME OUT.

1576
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:07,567
DOGGONE IT,
ALL I MEANT WAS-

1577
01:20:07,634 --> 01:20:08,834
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SHOUT AT ME.

1578
01:20:08,901 --> 01:20:10,534
I'M NOT SHOUTING.
I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU-

1579
01:20:10,601 --> 01:20:11,601
I KNOW I'VE MESSED
THINGS UP PLENTY.

1580
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:13,000
BUT IT ISN'T ANYTHING MONEY CAN'T FIX,

1581
01:20:13,067 --> 01:20:14,033
SO WHY CAN'T I
PAY FOR IT?

1582
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,067
NO!

1583
01:20:15,133 --> 01:20:17,067
WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO BE SO STUBBORN?

1584
01:20:17,133 --> 01:20:19,033
WHY CAN'T YOU BE PRACTICAL
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE?

1585
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,534
LOOK WHO'S TALKING
ABOUT BEING PRACTICAL.

1586
01:20:20,601 --> 01:20:22,200
YOU LISTEN TO ME. I'M GOING TO NEW YORK,

1587
01:20:22,267 --> 01:20:23,567
AND I'LL COLLECT
ENOUGH TO BUY YOU-

1588
01:20:23,634 --> 01:20:24,968
YOU WON'T BUY ME ANYTHING.

1589
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:26,267
WHAT AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

1590
01:20:26,334 --> 01:20:28,501
GO AROUND THE REST OF MY
LIFE IN SACKCLOTH AND ASHES

1591
01:20:28,567 --> 01:20:30,534
JUST BECAUSE A BIG
TENDERLOIN STEAK GOT SHOT?

1592
01:20:30,601 --> 01:20:32,067
NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME,
MR. HAYWARD.

1593
01:20:32,133 --> 01:20:34,067
I KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO,
AND NOBODY'S GOING TO STOP ME.

1594
01:20:34,133 --> 01:20:35,934
YOU'RE JUST TALKING
TO HEAR YOURSELF TALK.

1595
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,601
YOU'RE TRYING
TO PICK A FIGHT.

1596
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,601
TRYING? BROTHER,
THIS IS A FIGHT-

1597
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:41,868
OUR FIRST AND LAST.

1598
01:20:41,934 --> 01:20:44,701
IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU FEEL, GO
ON TO NEW YORK AND STAY THERE.

1599
01:20:44,767 --> 01:20:46,100
WELL, I WILL.

1600
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:47,567
ALL RIGHT.

1601
01:20:49,067 --> 01:20:50,434
AND CONGRATULATIONS.

1602
01:20:50,501 --> 01:20:53,667
YOU'RE SLIDING OUT JUST WHEN
THINGS ARE GETTING REALLY TOUGH.

1603
01:21:00,901 --> 01:21:02,067
Nan: HI, DADDY!

1604
01:21:02,133 --> 01:21:04,133
I GOT "EXCELLENT"
IN READING TODAY.

1605
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,601
GOOD.

1606
01:21:07,634 --> 01:21:10,067
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
DADDY? YOU LOOK MAD.

1607
01:21:10,133 --> 01:21:12,167
YOU SURE DO-
LIKE LAST SPRING

1608
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:13,801
WHEN THE COYOTES
RAIDED THE CHICKENS.

1609
01:21:13,868 --> 01:21:15,634
WHO ARE YOU MAD AT?

1610
01:21:15,701 --> 01:21:16,734
DADDY.

1611
01:21:16,801 --> 01:21:18,567
LOOK, KIDS, YOU'RE GOING
TO FIND OUT ANYWAY.

1612
01:21:18,634 --> 01:21:20,300
I MIGHT AS WELL TELL
YOU. KAY IS LEAVING.

1613
01:21:20,367 --> 01:21:21,567
LEAVING?

1614
01:21:21,634 --> 01:21:22,934
FOR WHERE?

1615
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,200
SHE'S GOING BACK
TO NEW YORK.

1616
01:21:24,267 --> 01:21:25,801
SHE'S COMING BACK,
ISN'T SHE?

1617
01:21:25,868 --> 01:21:26,934
I DON'T KNOW.

1618
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,467
DID SOMEBODY
DO SOMETHING?

1619
01:21:28,534 --> 01:21:32,067
NO. THINGS JUST DIDN'T WORK
OUT LIKE WE PLANNED, THAT'S ALL.

1620
01:21:32,133 --> 01:21:34,167
DOES SHE WANT
TO LEAVE?

1621
01:21:34,234 --> 01:21:37,267
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
DO WITHOUT HER, DADDY?

1622
01:21:37,334 --> 01:21:39,901
I'M GOING OVER TO TOM
RIDDLEY'S. I'LL BE BACK.

1623
01:21:39,968 --> 01:21:41,567
ARE YOU GOING
RODEOING AGAIN, DADDY?

1624
01:21:41,634 --> 01:21:42,601
YEAH.

1625
01:21:42,667 --> 01:21:44,734
BUT, DADDY...

1626
01:21:44,801 --> 01:21:48,601
GOLLY, MAYBE HE DOESN'T
LOVE KAY ANYMORE.

1627
01:21:48,667 --> 01:21:51,601
HE SAID HE FELL IN LOVE
WITH HER LIKE THAT.

1628
01:21:51,667 --> 01:21:54,367
MAYBE HE FELL OUT OF
LOVE LIKE THAT, TOO.

1629
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,234
HELLO, ANGELS.

1630
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:08,767
OH, KAY,
YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

1631
01:22:08,834 --> 01:22:10,567
YOU JUST CAN'T.
WE LOVE YOU.

1632
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:12,767
YOU BELONG HERE.

1633
01:22:14,501 --> 01:22:17,033
NO, BABIES, NO, I DON'T. THAT'S JUST IT.

1634
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,701
I'M WHAT YOU CALL
OUT OF MY ELEMENT.

1635
01:22:19,767 --> 01:22:20,968
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1636
01:22:21,033 --> 01:22:24,000
WELL, IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A FISH OUT OF WATER.

1637
01:22:24,067 --> 01:22:26,133
DID DADDY
CALL YOU THAT?

1638
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,400
NO.

1639
01:22:27,467 --> 01:22:33,067
NOW, LISTEN, I WANT YOU
BOTH TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND.

1640
01:22:33,133 --> 01:22:36,734
SOMETIMES A THING THAT
SEEMS TERRIBLE AT THE TIME

1641
01:22:36,801 --> 01:22:39,567
TURNS OUT TO BE
THE BEST FOR EVERYBODY,

1642
01:22:39,634 --> 01:22:42,868
LIKE MEDICINE,
BAD-TASTING MEDICINE.

1643
01:22:42,934 --> 01:22:45,033
I DON'T MIND TAKING MEDICINE, KAY,

1644
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,868
EVEN BAD-TASTING MEDICINE SOMETIMES.

1645
01:22:47,934 --> 01:22:51,100
ME, NEITHER.
OH, KAY...

1646
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:53,534
HI, KAY.

1647
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:55,234
OH, HI, ORV.

1648
01:22:59,601 --> 01:23:01,534
WELL, WHAT'S THIS
ALL ABOUT?

1649
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:02,834
I'M LEAVING, ORV.

1650
01:23:02,901 --> 01:23:05,801
I KNOW. CHRIS TOLD ME
TO TAKE YOU TO THE STATION,

1651
01:23:05,868 --> 01:23:09,234
BUT I AIN'T GONNA DO
NO SUCH A THING.

1652
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:11,667
I WANT YOU TO JUST
PUT MY BAGS IN THE CAR.

1653
01:23:11,734 --> 01:23:13,734
NOW, KAY,
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

1654
01:23:13,801 --> 01:23:17,000
YOU'RE ACTING JUST LIKE
MY SECOND WIFE MARY BELLE-

1655
01:23:17,067 --> 01:23:18,467
I MEAN, ELLIE MAE.

1656
01:23:18,534 --> 01:23:20,133
SHE PULLED
THE SAME STUNT.

1657
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,334
EVERY TIME
WE HAD A HASSLE,

1658
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,234
SHE GOT TO PACKING.

1659
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,801
WELL, SHE PULLED IT
JUST ONCE TOO OFTEN,

1660
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:28,367
AND I LET HER GO,

1661
01:23:28,434 --> 01:23:31,000
AND I AIN'T SEEN HIDE
NOR HAIR OF HER SINCE.

1662
01:23:31,067 --> 01:23:33,400
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

1663
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:35,901
YOU JUST GET OUT
OF THEM DUDS, AND-

1664
01:23:35,968 --> 01:23:37,734
THIS IS READY,
AND SO IS THAT ONE THERE.

1665
01:23:37,801 --> 01:23:39,067
BUT, KAY,
YOU'RE NOT-

1666
01:23:39,133 --> 01:23:40,434
I'M IN A HURRY.

1667
01:23:40,501 --> 01:23:44,334
OH, ALL RIGHT.

1668
01:23:54,667 --> 01:23:56,367
OH!

1669
01:24:15,734 --> 01:24:17,067
GET IN, BOY.

1670
01:24:17,133 --> 01:24:20,901
GET IN, PORGY.
COME ON, BOY, GET IN-UP.

1671
01:24:30,501 --> 01:24:32,367
LET'S GO.

1672
01:24:40,133 --> 01:24:43,501
WELL, I GUESS I AIN'T
NO BETTER A MATCHMAKER

1673
01:24:43,567 --> 01:24:45,567
THAN I WAS
A HUSBAND.

1674
01:24:45,634 --> 01:24:47,901
I'D SAY
IT'S A PHOTO FINISH.

1675
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,501
* LA LA LA LA LA *

1676
01:25:32,567 --> 01:25:34,133
JED, LISTEN TO THIS.

1677
01:25:35,667 --> 01:25:38,701
JED? JED,
LISTEN TO THIS.

1678
01:25:40,434 --> 01:25:46,434
* FUNNY WHAT A TUNE
CAN DO TO YOU *

1679
01:25:46,501 --> 01:25:56,501
* UNDERNEATH
THE WESTERN SKY *

1680
01:25:56,567 --> 01:25:57,400
BUCKAROO.

1681
01:25:57,467 --> 01:26:00,534
* SINGS A SAGEBRUSH... *

1682
01:26:00,601 --> 01:26:02,167
SAGEBRUSH
AND BUCKAROOS AGAIN.

1683
01:26:02,234 --> 01:26:03,634
DID YOU WAKE ME UP
FOR THAT?

1684
01:26:03,701 --> 01:26:05,133
LOOK, KAY, WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING

1685
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,334
A SOPHISTICATED MUSICAL
REEKING WITH MANHATTAN-

1686
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,400
BROADWAY, HARLEM, THE MET,
THE AUTOMAT, AND THE BMT.

1687
01:26:10,467 --> 01:26:12,434
I SUPPOSE
THAT'S NEW STUFF.

1688
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:13,968
IT'S YOUR STUFF, KAY!

1689
01:26:14,033 --> 01:26:16,701
THEY DON'T WANT WESTERN
SKIES OVER WYOMING.

1690
01:26:16,767 --> 01:26:19,000
THEY WANT STORMY WEATHER
OVER STATEN ISLAND.

1691
01:26:19,067 --> 01:26:20,501
WHERE IS IT-

1692
01:26:20,567 --> 01:26:23,734
THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS ALWAYS
SUREFIRE FOR A MILLION COPIES?

1693
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:27,868
I DON'T KNOW, JED.

1694
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:30,367
MAYBE I LEFT IT
SOMEWHERE AT THAT.

1695
01:26:30,434 --> 01:26:31,767
EVER SINCE
YOU CAME BACK,

1696
01:26:31,834 --> 01:26:35,067
I'VE HEARD NOTHING BUT HOWLING
COYOTES AND JINGLING SPURS.

1697
01:26:35,133 --> 01:26:36,901
I HEAR THEM
IN MY SLEEP. I-

1698
01:26:38,434 --> 01:26:40,567
THINK I HEAR THEM NOW.

1699
01:26:40,634 --> 01:26:42,567
I THINK I DO, TOO.

1700
01:26:44,501 --> 01:26:46,000
IT'S EVEN GETTING
PORGY.

1701
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:51,801
JED, WE ARE
HEARING THINGS.

1702
01:26:53,701 --> 01:26:55,868
KAY! KAY!

1703
01:26:55,934 --> 01:27:00,367
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PUT ME DOWN.

1704
01:27:00,434 --> 01:27:02,734
WELL, I TOTED HIM TO YOU ONCE BEFORE,

1705
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:04,601
BUT THIS IS THE LAST
TIME I'M GOING TO DO IT.

1706
01:27:04,667 --> 01:27:06,767
PUT ME DOWN, ORV.
HELLO, BUCKSHOT.

1707
01:27:06,834 --> 01:27:10,167
WELL, IF HE CAN'T COME HERE
UNDER HIS OWN POWER,

1708
01:27:10,234 --> 01:27:12,334
MAYBE YOU'D BETTER
JUST TOTE HIM OUT AGAIN.

1709
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,367
NOW, WAIT
A MINUTE, KAY.

1710
01:27:14,434 --> 01:27:16,501
WELL, GO AHEAD.
SPEAK YOUR PIECE.

1711
01:27:16,567 --> 01:27:19,200
KAY... OH, PUT ME
DOWN FIRST.

1712
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:25,601
KAY, I'M SORRY I WAS SO
STUBBORN ABOUT EVERYTHING, AND...

1713
01:27:25,667 --> 01:27:27,200
AND SHE'S
GOT TO COME BACK...

1714
01:27:27,267 --> 01:27:28,834
'CAUSE YOU'RE JUST
NO GOOD WITHOUT HER.

1715
01:27:28,901 --> 01:27:31,434
THAT'S A FACT, KAY.

1716
01:27:31,501 --> 01:27:34,534
EVER SINCE YOU LEFT, I HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO KEEP MY MIND ON ANYTHING.

1717
01:27:34,601 --> 01:27:36,234
OR HIS SEAT
IN THE SADDLE, EITHER.

1718
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,400
Nan: YEAH. DADDY'S BEEN
BUCKED OFF EVERY BRONC

1719
01:27:38,467 --> 01:27:39,968
FROM PENDLETON TO
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.

1720
01:27:40,033 --> 01:27:41,367
THAT'S RIGHT.

1721
01:27:41,434 --> 01:27:44,000
THAT'S WHY I'M LIMPING.

1722
01:27:49,634 --> 01:27:52,033
I'VE BEEN HAVING THE SAME
TROUBLE WITH MY MUSIC.

1723
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,734
OH, CHRIS!

1724
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:55,400
Tina and Nan:
WHOOPEE!

1725
01:27:55,467 --> 01:27:57,000
BUT, KAY, YOU CAN'T
WALK OUT ON ME.

1726
01:27:57,067 --> 01:27:58,767
YOU'VE GOT TO
FINISH THAT SCORE.

1727
01:27:58,834 --> 01:28:00,534
HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE A PUNCH IN THE NOSE?

1728
01:28:00,601 --> 01:28:03,100
OH, CHRIS, OH!

1729
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:13,968
OH, ORV! DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN TOTE ALL OF US?

1730
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:20,033
JUST STAY BUNCHED UP,
AND LET'S GO.

1731
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:22,934
PORGY, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO WALK.
