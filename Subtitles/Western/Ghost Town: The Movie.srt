1
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,053
Marshal Duckett?
I'm Sheriff Parker.

2
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,256
My deputy, Tuck.
Welcome to Ghost Town.

3
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:00,559
Come a long way, Sheriff.
What's goin' on here?

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,128
We appreciate that,
Marshal, we truly do.

5
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,898
Looks like this town's
already cleaned itself up.

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,599
Yeah? How's that?

7
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,637
Well, sir,
Harmon Teaster came to town.

8
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,572
- Harmon Teaster?
- Yes, sir.

9
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:58,083
<i>[Narrator] American settlers</i>
<i>fought over land and gold.</i>

10
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,652
<i>They pushed far</i>
<i>to the western sea,</i>

11
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,122
<i>leaving a trail of blood</i>
<i>in their wake.</i>

12
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,992
<i>In the east,</i>
<i>pioneer settlers</i>

13
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,728
<i>from the distant Celtic</i>
<i>and Scottish lands</i>

14
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,264
<i>settled in</i>
<i>the rugged Appalachians.</i>

15
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:17,336
<i>Life was hard</i>
<i>for these proud, rugged people.</i>

16
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,805
<i>Blood was thicker</i>
<i>than water,</i>

17
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,442
<i>and their conflicts were often</i>
<i>settled in pounds of flesh--</i>

18
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,112
<i>where an eye for an eye</i>

19
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:31,517
<i>was an unspoken duty toward</i>
<i>preserving family honor.</i>

20
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,587
<i>Rightin' the wrongs</i>
<i>done to family was common.</i>

21
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,956
<i>Feelings toward</i>
<i>the neighboring Cherokee</i>

22
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,459
<i>ran both hot and cold.</i>

23
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,530
<i>Some called them "brother,"</i>
<i>and some called them "savages."</i>

24
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:50,002
<i>The Appalachian folklore legend</i>
<i>of Harmon Teaster,</i>

25
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,539
<i>who lived and walked</i>
<i>these mountains,</i>

26
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,609
<i>was a man driven</i>
<i>by honor for his family</i>

27
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,280
<i>who brought his own</i>
<i>brand of justice.</i>

28
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,316
<i>This would haunt him</i>
<i>deep into his winter years.</i>

29
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,420
<i>These mountains</i>
<i>will teach something</i>

30
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:13,058
<i>to anyone who will truly listen</i>
<i>to what they have to say.</i>

31
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:16,195
<i>So listen as they speak now.</i>

32
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,169
[coughing]

33
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,642
It'll help.
Now sip that down.

34
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,978
You tryin'
to poison me?

35
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,680
Stop teasin'
and drink up.

36
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,749
That tonic will
make you feel better.

37
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,237
Susie! [gasps]

38
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,417
[speaks in Cherokee]

39
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:18,057
Violet, I saw your ma,
Susie, behind that tree!

40
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,525
- Pa...
- Plain as day.

41
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,261
- You're burning up with fever.
- I saw your ma.

42
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,832
You get on up inside.
Come on. Come on, Pa.

43
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:50,356
[breathing heavily]

44
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,491
I saw her.

45
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,827
You thought you saw her.

46
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,962
- I did.
- It's the fever.

47
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,897
I did see her.

48
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,170
Just lie a spell and rest.

49
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,740
I'm making some broth
to keep your strength up.

50
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,979
I love you.
You're my little angel.

51
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,249
I love you, too.

52
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,621
I'm gonna go to the garden
and pick a few things.

53
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,790
Just rest yourself here
quietly.

54
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,760
[breathing heavily]

55
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,805
Pa! John Burnett's
riding in with his boys.

56
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,640
They're coming this way.

57
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,610
I told you Pa
would come for me.

58
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,979
Your pa can come say
anything he wants, boy,

59
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,249
but you're still gonna stand
trial for killin' that Injun.

60
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,352
Injun! Boy.

61
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,021
Ain't no sense
about them Cherokee.

62
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:03,062
Pa...I don't think
he's coming here to talk.

63
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,897
Why don't you
just let him go?

64
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:11,103
Do you think that's right,
Harmon? Just turn him loose?

65
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,441
Boy makes a lot
of sense there, Sheriff.

66
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,209
Shut your mouth,
Victor!

67
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,144
- You ought to listen.
- I said shut up!

68
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,916
I ask you again, do you think
that's the right thing to do?

69
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,051
Just set him free?

70
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,322
Ransom,
you got my son.

71
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,902
Your son killed an
Injun boy in cold blood.

72
00:06:32,903 --> 00:06:34,660
I saw him with my own two eyes.

73
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:37,196
[John] That wasn't no boy.
That was a savage.

74
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,898
Doesn't matter.
He's standing trial for what he did.

75
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,901
My son got some
growin' up to do,

76
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,538
but I can't have him gettin' in all
this trouble over some thievin' redskin.

77
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,974
Now you tell me how
we can work this out.

78
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,177
Mr. Burnett,
just back yourself out of here.

79
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,214
I'm sending for the judge
tomorrow morning.

80
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,750
- You ignorant ass!
- Pa!

81
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:02,955
I tried to be civil, and you
went and got all righteous on me.

82
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,356
Boys!

83
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,227
Open that cell.

84
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,361
Now!

85
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:13,632
[Ransom groans]

86
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,335
I ain't got no key!

87
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,270
Find the key.

88
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,741
Hurry up!
Open that cell.

89
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,281
Get in there.

90
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:34,853
[laughing]
Watch him, Pa.

91
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,321
[horse neighing]

92
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,890
[Ransom groans]

93
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,925
Just let him go.
Please!

94
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,029
You come from bad seed, boy.
[gun cocks]

95
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,301
Ain't your doin',
but that don't matter none.

96
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,936
[groans]

97
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,272
[Ransom]
Help, please, God!

98
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,742
[henchmen grunting]

99
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:02,147
Digger, where you at?
Digger!

100
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,951
- Right here.
- Get one of them pine boxes.

101
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,020
We got
a dead man walkin'.

102
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,656
[laughing]
Dead man walkin'!

103
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,737
Come on.
Get it up.

104
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,910
Put him in it, boys.

105
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:36,348
No, no, no! No!

106
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,418
- No! No! No!
- [Victor laughs]

107
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,220
No! No!

108
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:44,189
Make yourself comfortable.
[laughing]

109
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,692
Close it up.

110
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:54,400
[Ransom groans]

111
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,502
Digger!

112
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,973
- [Ransom groans]
- Never did like you nohow.

113
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,813
[groans]
No! No!

114
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,882
Get a hammer and nails.

115
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:18,223
[horse neighing]

116
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,193
[spits]

117
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,762
[Ransom]
No!

118
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,631
Get the hell out here!

119
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,734
Digger,
nail her shut.

120
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,969
- I'm gonna kill you all.
- [hammering]

121
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,038
[Victor laughs]
That's one.

122
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:37,109
Two.
[laughing]

123
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,778
Three.

124
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,947
And that's four--
Hey, hey, hey! Hold it.

125
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,752
- Knock knock.
- [Ransom] Help!

126
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,288
I don't think
he's dead yet, Pa.

127
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,890
- [Victor laughing]
- Let's shut him up, boys.

128
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,194
- [Victor laughing]
- [Ransom] No! No! No! No!

129
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:26,759
[Victor laughing]

130
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:31,330
[humming]

131
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:35,000
[Victor cackles]

132
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,869
- What do you think, Pa?
- Light him up.

133
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,573
[laughing]

134
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,982
Hey.
You Ransom's boy?

135
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,785
Yes. Ye--

136
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,787
Who are you?

137
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,855
I'm Jim Jumper.

138
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,957
We gotta help him.

139
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,060
No, we gotta
get you outta here.

140
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,095
Now, come on.

141
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:08,267
Let it be known
that from now on,

142
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,303
the Burnetts
run Maggie Valley...

143
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,106
and all of Haywood County.

144
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:17,476
Anybody got a problem,
you come see me.

145
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,750
[Young Violet]
Wake up, Pa.

146
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,790
Susie!

147
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,326
[speaks in Cherokee]

148
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,100
Come home to me.

149
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:45,037
Ma!

150
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,439
Not yet, Pa.

151
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,846
[Victor laughing]
Time to die, Harmon.

152
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,817
- Pa!
- [grunts, gasps]

153
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,356
Y-You dream.

154
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,458
[groans]

155
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,803
Who are you?

156
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:26,111
The white man...
who I once called husband...

157
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,447
named me Susie.

158
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,417
Husband was also
an angry and abusive man.

159
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,020
He's no longer alive.

160
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,658
Get some of that
into him.

161
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,900
Those men.

162
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,471
Did they follow us?

163
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,974
They didn't follow us.

164
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,718
You must eat
to have strength.

165
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,591
I can't.

166
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,636
[Violet]
Please? Just try a little.

167
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:31,076
No. [whimpers] No.
I don't want to.

168
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,945
- You're gettin' worse.
- I'm not hungry.

169
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:37,049
You're gettin' worse,
and I think you need medicine.

170
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,919
I've tried all of Ma's cures,
but the fever won't break.

171
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,857
Maybe...

172
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,293
I could go to town.

173
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,429
No. You don't go to town.

174
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,965
I know.
Papa was killed in town.

175
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,636
You don't go to town.

176
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,139
Whatever happened there
happened a long time ago.

177
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,207
Things have changed.

178
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,278
You don't know if
your uncle will get that--

179
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,747
He could be gone
for weeks, Pa!

180
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:11,283
- We don't know how long.
- No.

181
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,719
- Please.
- No, you don't go.

182
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,721
I know the memories
are hard on you.

183
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:16,605
You don't go.

184
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,458
And I know how you
feel about what you did.

185
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,995
[sobbing] Susie.

186
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:25,831
Susie...

187
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,544
<i>[Ransom's voice]</i>
<i>Do you think that's right, Harmon?</i>

188
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,612
<i>[echoes]</i>
<i>...that's right, Harmon?</i>

189
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,152
[shouts]

190
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,623
Thought we were
gonna lose you.

191
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,464
No.

192
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,899
You been down
nearly a week.

193
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,268
Susie been by your side
the whole time.

194
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,406
She's taken
a shine to you.

195
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,878
She's down by the river,
bathin' in the moonlight.

196
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,180
Women things,
I reckon. [chuckles]

197
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,885
I know what you're thinking.

198
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,054
You think if you can get
far enough away from here

199
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,156
and if you've taken fond
of Susie, well, then--

200
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,532
I have taken a...

201
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,967
shine to her.

202
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,573
But a man's got to do...

203
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,511
what he's got to do.

204
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:49,882
I understand about righting
wrongs done to family.

205
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,917
I could help you.

206
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,088
This ain't your fight.

207
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,496
Well, you'd best go
'fore she comes back.

208
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,467
Take the horse.
We'll wait for you here.

209
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:49,808
I'm sorry. I can't
let you die like Ma.

210
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,163
<i>[Young Violet's voice]</i>
<i>I can't let you die.</i>

211
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,915
[man screaming, shouting]

212
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,354
[screaming continues]

213
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,802
What the hell's
going on here?

214
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:54,006
My leg! My leg!

215
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:55,641
Leave him alone!

216
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,543
Marion!

217
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,281
[screaming]

218
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:11,256
[screaming]

219
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,493
[groaning]

220
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,814
[John groaning]

221
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,744
How much wood
you think she'll take?

222
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:09,415
You're gonna have to replace all of this.
I can tell that already.

223
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,184
- And...
- What?

224
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,255
Cole, how much
did you pay for this?

225
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,190
Pete gave me
a good deal on it.

226
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,592
- He said it was slightly used.
- "Slightly"?

227
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,331
Look at this thing.

228
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:24,129
It looks like it's been up and down
the Oregon Trail a half dozen times.

229
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,665
Damn it all to hell!
Damn!

230
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,903
She still
wants to leave?

231
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,504
You know...

232
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,081
This town is full
of whores and sinners.

233
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,422
Good morning, madame,
and how are you today?

234
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,524
Morning.
Morning.

235
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,397
Is this it?

236
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,933
Yeah. I know it
don't look like much,

237
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,168
but with a few improvements,
it'll work.

238
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,870
How long?

239
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,740
Couple days.
Maybe a week.

240
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:12,044
A week? I want out
of this godforsaken town now!

241
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,247
And you...
your father...

242
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,182
[Bobcat]
Happy birthday, Willy.

243
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,786
He's the animal
that killed my brother.

244
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:26,091
And you do nothing!

245
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,467
Looks like you got
a problem with your missy.

246
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,569
[laughing]

247
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,672
You got somethin'
you wanna say to me?

248
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,243
I don't believe
in guns.

249
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,380
If I did...

250
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,015
You'd be dead.

251
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,920
It's lucky for you I don't
believe in shooting an unarmed man.

252
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,890
It's downright
unsporting.

253
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:03,629
But I'd be happy to loan you one.
Bang! [laughing]

254
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,798
That's enough, Jim.
Put it away.

255
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:11,070
So, Willy, your pa's having a birthday party
for you tonight down at the Silver Dollar.

256
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:13,005
Is that right?

257
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:15,040
Just tell him
that I'm not interested.

258
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,512
Hey, uh, you know
how your daddy gets.

259
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,850
Think it'd be best
if you just came, you know.

260
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:27,353
He ain't gonna take it
too kindly if you don't come,

261
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:30,255
bein' that you're
the guest of honor and all!

262
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:06,125
Well, lookee here.

263
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:09,294
Look like another whore's
come to town. [cackling]

264
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:47,566
At 30, I was involved
in so much.

265
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:51,270
Mining, owning saloons,
land, more.

266
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,608
Will has no interest
in any of that.

267
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,613
That boy is meek
and worthless to me.

268
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,016
- But he's your blood, Victor.
- Yeah.

269
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:06,552
Maybe he'll come around.

270
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:10,723
Hopefully. Ah.

271
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,397
[Victor]
Mmm...

272
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,432
Coffee?

273
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,172
Shot of poison, sir?

274
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:29,208
Not this early.

275
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:39,184
Here. Buy yourself
something nice for tonight.

276
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:40,753
Thank you.

277
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:55,434
You know... I think I have
an idea how to loosen Will up.

278
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,869
[laughing]

279
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:39,545
Dear Almighty Father,
it's me, Violet.

280
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:43,015
I've never been
in a church before,

281
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:45,584
so forgive me
if I do something wrong.

282
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,622
I ask that you send your
healing hand down to touch my pa,

283
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,224
Harmon Teaster.

284
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:56,495
Have mercy
and don't call him home yet.

285
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:00,065
He's an honest man

286
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:02,334
and always a good
husband and father.

287
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,571
Don't ask
to save others.

288
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,908
You might put me
out of business.

289
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,810
Elmer Inlow's the name.

290
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,284
Folks round here
call me Digger.

291
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:23,922
I do all the burying
when duty calls.

292
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:26,425
All up through Haywood
and Buncombe County.

293
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:36,168
So, uh...

294
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:40,072
did you say
your pa was sick?

295
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:41,573
Yes, sir.

296
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:46,612
You say his name
was <i>Harmon</i> Teaster?

297
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:51,016
Is it?

298
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,521
Could you direct me
to the doctor's office?

299
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:57,456
I'm sure I passed it.

300
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:04,329
Morning.

301
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,402
Morning, Will.

302
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,007
I'm Violet.

303
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:18,444
Will Burnett.
Good to meet you.

304
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:22,348
I'll leave you two
to yourselves.

305
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:27,252
I got business
to take care of.

306
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,426
[sighs] That man
is a little strange.

307
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,028
Strange. I know.

308
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:44,670
This is
a beautiful church.

309
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,039
Thank you.

310
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,274
Is it yours, or...

311
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:53,612
No. I'm just the caretaker,
I guess you could say.

312
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:56,115
Caretaker?

313
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:58,784
See, our preacher,
he kind of left town,

314
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:02,621
and some of the folks still like
to get together on Sundays.

315
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,890
So I'm trying
to keep it open and...

316
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,760
do a little reading from
the Good Book here and there.

317
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:09,428
You preach.

318
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:11,864
I wouldn't go so far
as to call it preaching.

319
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:13,999
Just...good folks
getting together

320
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,869
for a little bit
of reading, praying.

321
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,904
I think that's wonderful.

322
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,677
- Well...
- Well...

323
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:28,013
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

324
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,448
No, say what you
were gonna say.

325
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:32,918
I really wasn't saying
anything, so please.

326
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,990
I was gonna ask if you could
direct me to the doctor's office.

327
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,658
You do have
a doctor in town?

328
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,294
Oh, yeah.
Dr. Hugh Morrison.

329
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:43,629
He's a wonderful man,

330
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,199
and, uh, I'd be happy
to take you to see him.

331
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,712
Thank you.

332
00:27:47,713 --> 00:27:50,169
Is it all right if I leave
my horse tied up here?

333
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,339
- Yeah, that'd be fine.
- I shouldn't be too long.

334
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,941
Are you... sick
or something?

335
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:57,476
No, my pa is.

336
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:01,380
Sorry.
Well, right this way.

337
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:10,589
You should come to church
on Sunday with me.

338
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,758
Might be a nice change.

339
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:18,097
Might be. It gets harder and harder
to do this thing all the time.

340
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:20,165
- You remember my friend Ally?
- Sure.

341
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:23,335
From Richmond?
I had a letter from her.

342
00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:25,471
And she's getting along
just fine.

343
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:29,875
She's married now, and she's
looking to have a family.

344
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:34,046
You help some
to help themselves,

345
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,382
and you watch over
the others until then.

346
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:39,985
You do a good thing here,
Birdie.

347
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:43,689
Why, General James Martin.

348
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,858
How you doin'?

349
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:49,661
Listen,
you wouldn't know the...

350
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:51,730
whereabouts of Victor Burnett now,
would you?

351
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,132
[spits]

352
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:57,302
Buzzard.

353
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,214
[sighs]
Good morning.

354
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:11,150
- Good morning.
- Could I have one?

355
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:16,722
I don't want that.
Give me the good stuff.

356
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:24,396
Anybody know where, uh,

357
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:27,433
Mr. Burnett is, or what
kind of mood he's in?

358
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,501
He's in a foul mood
this morning.

359
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:33,172
He is a little more
on edge than normal.

360
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:36,308
To hell with you, Digger!

361
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:39,745
You ain't never gonna get me
in one of your boxes.

362
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:41,880
Yeah, we'll see.
Another drink.

363
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:49,288
- What's he so edgy about?
- Hard to say.

364
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,689
Well...

365
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:56,228
Well, I think they're trying to plan
a birthday party for Will tonight.

366
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:57,996
- A party?
- Yeah, he is...

367
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:00,332
planning a birthday party
this evening.

368
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,702
But he can't
find Will.

369
00:30:03,703 --> 00:30:08,173
I just saw him coming down the
street a while ago with Sorrells.

370
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:11,810
And, you know, he had
that biddy old wife with him.

371
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:14,179
[Judd, Digger laughing]

372
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,399
Give me another drink.

373
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,783
This is gonna be a good
celebration tonight.

374
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:24,223
Madame Birdie,
if I was you, I'd move!

375
00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:25,724
- Digger...
- [Digger] Now, Jackknife...

376
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:28,027
I'm gonna make
old Digger dance!

377
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:30,562
- You better put that gun away.
- [Judd] Put that gun away!

378
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:32,664
I'll put you
in a pine box.

379
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,900
To hell with you, too,
Mr. Judd!

380
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:36,869
- [laughing]
- [gunshot]

381
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:46,311
Runnin' out
like some crippled bird.

382
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:52,351
[Little Jack]
Pa.

383
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,386
It's all right.
It's all right.

384
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:56,989
Pa, I thought I told you
you can't be firing in here.

385
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:01,427
I was just having a little fun.
I was gonna make old Digger dance.

386
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:04,663
- Yeah, I know.
- Victor used to make him dance.

387
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:06,699
Victor shot him
one time.

388
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,234
Mr. Burnett doesn't like to be woken up.
Gotta get you outta here.

389
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:11,470
Hey! What's all
the ruckus down here?

390
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:13,472
I'm sorry, Mr. Burnett.
My pa, he just--

391
00:31:13,473 --> 00:31:17,509
Listen, Little Jack.
I can talk for my own self.

392
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:22,181
Well, Mr. Mayor,

393
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:24,983
I see you brought
your pet dog with you.

394
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:27,252
[chuckles]

395
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:30,622
You may dress like
a white man, Injun,

396
00:31:30,623 --> 00:31:33,459
but that don't make you one.

397
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,594
And I'll tell you
something else.

398
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:40,099
I've killed a-many
of your kind in my day.

399
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,700
Yeah. Chief!

400
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:43,669
- Come on, Pa.
- I told you.

401
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,004
- [Victor shouts]
- [Jackknife shouts]

402
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:51,343
Old Knife here
worked for my pa.

403
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:54,513
He's a good man.
Just a bit too much shine.

404
00:31:54,514 --> 00:31:57,916
- Take him home to sleep it off.
- Yes, sir, I will. Come on.

405
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:12,564
Huh. Well,
I don't know, Victor.

406
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:15,668
I'm just pleased
to help you any way I can.

407
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:18,671
You know I appreciate your
support for my railroad project.

408
00:32:18,672 --> 00:32:21,674
Well then, of course, I'm gonna
expect your support come election time.

409
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:23,375
- Right?
- You know you'll have that.

410
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:25,444
Okay.
Copperhead, let's go.

411
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:43,395
- Mr. Burnett, sir...
- Very busy today, Digger.

412
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:45,798
Oh, Mr. Burnett.
I got some information

413
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,733
you might find
very interesting.

414
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:50,169
What?

415
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,771
It's about
your pa's murderer.

416
00:32:52,772 --> 00:32:55,774
- [grunts] Mr. Burnett--
- Never mention my pa again!

417
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:01,847
You're not fit
to lick his boots!

418
00:33:04,684 --> 00:33:06,652
Keep your mouth shut!

419
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:11,924
I'm sor--
I'm sorry, Mr. Burnett.

420
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,700
Ah, hell.

421
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:24,269
Come on to my office later on.
We'll talk about it.

422
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,338
Okay, Mr. Burnett.

423
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,464
Well, here you go.

424
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:54,900
Thank you.

425
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:56,769
Thank you so much, Doctor.

426
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,071
It's a pleasure, Gladys,
and, Caleb, remember,

427
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:01,173
when you're climbing
those trees,

428
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:03,642
grab separate branches
with each hand.

429
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:06,245
- Okay? You'll fall less often.
- Will do.

430
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:10,282
Are you gonna be staying
in town for a little while?

431
00:34:10,283 --> 00:34:13,152
No, I'll be heading home
soon as I get the medicine.

432
00:34:13,153 --> 00:34:15,587
Yeah.

433
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:17,690
I was hoping that maybe
one of these Sundays

434
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:21,727
you could come down
and sit in church.

435
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:24,496
I would like that.

436
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:27,166
All right. I'll let you tend
to your duties directly here.

437
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:30,035
I don't mean to
hold you up or nothin'.

438
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:31,537
It was a pleasure.

439
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,640
No, listen, the...

440
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:37,776
the pleasure...
was all mine.

441
00:34:39,112 --> 00:34:41,080
Hope to see you soon.

442
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:52,257
Take care.

443
00:34:54,361 --> 00:34:56,195
Pardon me.

444
00:34:56,196 --> 00:34:57,830
Are you Dr. Morrison?

445
00:34:57,831 --> 00:34:59,264
I am.

446
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:04,570
How can I help you?

447
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:06,638
I have a father
with a persistent fever,

448
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,040
and I really
need your help.

449
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,776
- You are?
- I'm sorry. My manners.

450
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:13,445
Uh, I'm Violet...
Teaster.

451
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:16,648
- Teaster, you said?
- Yes, sir.

452
00:35:16,649 --> 00:35:18,717
Where's your father at?

453
00:35:18,718 --> 00:35:20,853
Back over
towards Cold...

454
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:23,088
Just a few
mountains over.

455
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:25,391
He was too sick
to travel, so I thought

456
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:27,993
maybe you can give me a tonic
that I could take to him.

457
00:35:27,994 --> 00:35:29,828
We can try something.

458
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:35,334
But if I can't see him, it's
hard to know what will help him.

459
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:37,936
Anything you can do
will be much appreciated.

460
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:40,673
I can pay.
Not much, but some.

461
00:35:40,674 --> 00:35:44,943
We'll work that out.
I'm sure I have something.

462
00:35:44,944 --> 00:35:48,080
I haven't seen you
around here before, have I?

463
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:49,148
No.

464
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,752
I don't blame you.
This used to be a family town.

465
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:57,656
Now, it's gotten
worse and worse.

466
00:35:57,657 --> 00:36:00,259
I used to see
more kids like that

467
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,761
with fractured arms,
climbing trees.

468
00:36:02,762 --> 00:36:06,298
Now I'm doing
mostly gunshot wounds.

469
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:09,435
I didn't see too many women and
children when I came into town.

470
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:11,437
They're hiding.

471
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:14,473
The sheriff has no control
over what goes on here.

472
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:18,811
Drunks are running around on
the street all day and all night.

473
00:36:18,812 --> 00:36:22,881
If you're traveling by yourself,
you better be careful.

474
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:24,950
I will.

475
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:28,020
Um... I'm gonna
wrap this up.

476
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,589
Do you want some...
Freshen up?

477
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:34,059
Or, uh, can I make you
something to eat? Or...

478
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,962
I'll take you up
on the freshen.

479
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:38,430
Thank you.

480
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:45,904
Are you damn sure
she said Harmon Teaster?

481
00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:47,906
I'm sure as day,
Mr. Burnett.

482
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:54,279
- Leave.
- Now, Mr. Burnett...

483
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,714
Take off!

484
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:02,287
[laughing]

485
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:09,528
Yeah.

486
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:49,068
[yelling]

487
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,772
<i>[Young Victor yelling]</i>

488
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,646
Captain! Captain!

489
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:03,315
[shouting]

490
00:38:04,884 --> 00:38:06,452
[grunting]

491
00:38:09,055 --> 00:38:10,489
[spits]

492
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:19,498
[gasps] Oh... Pete...

493
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:22,001
[breathing heavily]
Ain't right, Captain!

494
00:38:22,002 --> 00:38:23,969
It just ain't right!

495
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,071
- It ain't right, Sheriff.
- We ought to do something.

496
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:27,906
Oh, Betsy...

497
00:38:27,907 --> 00:38:31,243
Stay here.
Both of you.

498
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,680
Let's get inside.

499
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:43,789
You got something
to say to me, Sheriff?

500
00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:49,361
I reckon not.

501
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:50,829
[Whiskey]
Captain.

502
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:56,435
Sir, Mr. Burnett's
looking all over for you.

503
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:58,871
I was just up with him
a short time ago.

504
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:00,939
Yes, sir. Well,
he says it's important.

505
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:17,623
[sighs]

506
00:39:24,664 --> 00:39:26,398
Here, I'll take that.

507
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:28,400
This should keep it
safe for the journey.

508
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:31,003
Take one spoonful
every hour. Okay?

509
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:32,705
That fever
just might break.

510
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,441
Thank you so very much.
How much do I owe you?

511
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:37,509
How's a dollar sound?

512
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:41,480
Thank you, Doctor.

513
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:43,916
Bye.

514
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:52,825
Sorry I'm late.

515
00:39:52,826 --> 00:39:54,660
I put my pa
down to bed.

516
00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:57,529
What are we having
this little meeting for?

517
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,032
Maybe we're all
getting a raise.

518
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:01,967
- [laughing]
- Yeah, a raise.

519
00:40:01,968 --> 00:40:03,469
[Victor]
Silence!

520
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:09,441
Some of you know that
my parents were murdered.

521
00:40:09,442 --> 00:40:12,611
As well as many of the citizens
of this town some years back.

522
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:16,749
That's right.
It was by that one Harmon Teaster fella.

523
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,283
Quiet!

524
00:40:18,284 --> 00:40:20,252
- [giggling]
- [Victor] Get out of here.

525
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:27,092
It has just been
brought to my attention

526
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:30,496
that this man who was never
brought to justice is still alive.

527
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:34,133
And his daughter walks
these very streets as we speak.

528
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:36,969
[Moose] I done seen
a strange girl in town.

529
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,404
Ain't that right, Joe?

530
00:40:39,572 --> 00:40:42,007
Saw her head
into Doc's office.

531
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:44,109
Well, I want that girl
brought to me.

532
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,912
A hundred dollars to anyone
who brings her here immediately.

533
00:40:56,856 --> 00:40:58,057
[Whiskey]
Let's do it.

534
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:06,331
- You want the girl unharmed?
- For now.

535
00:41:15,575 --> 00:41:17,509
Run, girl. Run fast.

536
00:41:18,678 --> 00:41:20,746
You say something
to me, General?

537
00:41:20,747 --> 00:41:22,715
Hell with you, Yankee.

538
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:27,186
Not my fault you fought
on the wrong side.

539
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:28,921
Confederate forever.

540
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:34,393
The last shot of the war rang
out right over in Waynesville.

541
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:38,097
Confederacy's dead.

542
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:40,132
I still be hearing
the echo.

543
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:45,738
- Good day, General.
- Captain.

544
00:41:59,753 --> 00:42:02,888
- Howdy, Will.
- Hey, Tom. How you doin'?

545
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:06,258
All right.
What you working on?

546
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:09,328
Just tinkering with a few
things here and there.

547
00:42:11,431 --> 00:42:14,433
Mm. Place is looking
mighty fine.

548
00:42:14,434 --> 00:42:17,002
Yeah? Thank you.
It's coming along.

549
00:42:17,003 --> 00:42:19,872
So what brings you
down here?

550
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:22,574
Oh, I, uh--
I just, uh...

551
00:42:22,575 --> 00:42:26,812
come in to, uh...
reflect a little.

552
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:31,483
You need to talk
about something?

553
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:40,325
Well...I feel peculiar
talking to you about this.

554
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:43,862
That's on account
of my pa, ain't it?

555
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:51,470
Will, how can you be
such a decent, honest man

556
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:54,673
when your pa's
the way he is?

557
00:42:54,674 --> 00:42:57,042
I always account it
to the fact

558
00:42:57,043 --> 00:42:59,044
that his parents
were all murdered.

559
00:42:59,045 --> 00:43:00,446
Hmm...

560
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:04,550
But, uh, that don't
account for

561
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:07,553
the way he was
before they were killed.

562
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:09,188
You were there?

563
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,257
Uh! I saw enough.

564
00:43:13,893 --> 00:43:16,161
I know...the truth

565
00:43:16,162 --> 00:43:19,164
about what happened
with Harmon Teaster.

566
00:43:21,334 --> 00:43:25,871
His pa was the law
around here.

567
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:28,540
And your pa...

568
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:31,377
had done gotten himself
into some bad trouble.

569
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:33,579
What kind
of trouble?

570
00:43:35,982 --> 00:43:37,516
[exhales]

571
00:43:41,321 --> 00:43:42,721
Well, Will...

572
00:43:44,524 --> 00:43:47,626
He got drunk on shine
and killed some Indian boy.

573
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:52,531
And, uh,
Harmon Teaster's pa, Ransom,

574
00:43:52,532 --> 00:43:54,967
he was dead set

575
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:58,137
on having your pa stand trial
for what he'd done.

576
00:43:59,372 --> 00:44:03,942
Then your granddaddy,
Big John Burnett,

577
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:07,012
wickedly set his men
upon Ransom Teaster.

578
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:10,482
The whole town
saw what happened.

579
00:44:12,585 --> 00:44:14,920
No man should have
suffered that way.

580
00:44:16,456 --> 00:44:20,793
And Harmon Teaster witnessed
that merciless killing

581
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:22,795
from a jail cell window.

582
00:44:24,064 --> 00:44:26,265
Somehow he escaped,

583
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:30,569
and when he came back
a few nights later...

584
00:44:31,738 --> 00:44:35,074
he brought down
a vengeance on your family

585
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:37,343
and all the men
responsible

586
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:40,879
that is legendary
in its violence.

587
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,983
I mean, he made this town
into a ghost town.

588
00:44:46,586 --> 00:44:50,022
I never heard the part
about the lawman before.

589
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:54,226
Well, I reckon... they left
some of the facts out.

590
00:44:54,227 --> 00:44:56,895
Reckon so.

591
00:44:56,896 --> 00:45:00,299
Now, your pa was hell-bent
on striking back.

592
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,268
But all the Burnett
gun hands were dead.

593
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:10,275
So he went around to other towns and
raised a small army of cutthroats.

594
00:45:10,276 --> 00:45:14,079
They started out
looking for Harmon Teaster.

595
00:45:15,982 --> 00:45:18,484
Never found him.

596
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:20,586
Now, legend says
that he hid himself out

597
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:23,689
in some mountain den
for years.

598
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:25,924
Others say he took in
with the Cherokee.

599
00:45:27,327 --> 00:45:29,495
Don't you think that
he'd be dead by now?

600
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:30,763
May be.

601
00:45:32,332 --> 00:45:35,534
But secrets
don't always stay buried.

602
00:45:38,505 --> 00:45:40,406
Will...

603
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:45,010
this town is as bad now
as it ever was.

604
00:45:45,011 --> 00:45:46,845
Maybe worse.

605
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:50,249
Now, I know
I should do something.

606
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:57,322
But I saw what they did
to that other lawman...

607
00:45:57,323 --> 00:45:58,557
Ransom Teaster...

608
00:46:06,232 --> 00:46:07,599
I'm afraid.

609
00:46:08,968 --> 00:46:10,969
Tom, if you're afraid,

610
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:14,006
why don't you just leave?

611
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:16,675
Oh, I can run
from different places,

612
00:46:18,078 --> 00:46:20,412
but I can't run
from myself.

613
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:25,217
Your pa and his boys
are getting way out of hand.

614
00:46:25,218 --> 00:46:28,020
The people of this town
are looking for help.

615
00:46:29,823 --> 00:46:31,757
What are you gonna do?

616
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:39,631
I have no clear path
in sight.

617
00:46:39,632 --> 00:46:42,701
So... I come to pray.

618
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:49,441
I know it's been
a long time, but...

619
00:46:49,442 --> 00:46:53,679
maybe He'll still listen
to an old man with a badge

620
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,614
seeking to do
the right thing.

621
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:03,422
Well, Tom, I'm gonna
let you sit here and reflect.

622
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:06,959
- Thanks, Will.
- No. Thank you.

623
00:47:25,378 --> 00:47:27,379
Almighty God...

624
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:32,017
hear my prayer.

625
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:37,890
Do you have
an appointment?

626
00:47:37,891 --> 00:47:39,425
No.

627
00:47:39,426 --> 00:47:41,660
We're looking for a little lady
that was seen coming in here.

628
00:47:41,661 --> 00:47:43,128
She still here, Doc?

629
00:47:44,397 --> 00:47:48,000
Excuse me. I have
sensitive materials here.

630
00:47:48,001 --> 00:47:51,537
Sensitive?
Sensitive materials...

631
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:53,238
for a sensitive man.

632
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:58,444
I'm getting real sensitive
about finding this girl, Doc.

633
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:01,547
Hell, Bobcat,
that ain't the right word.

634
00:48:01,548 --> 00:48:04,717
[Dr. Morrison chuckles]
She's not here.

635
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,785
[Whiskey] She was here.
She ain't here now.

636
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:13,225
Doc, you wouldn't be keeping that
woman to yourself now, would you?

637
00:48:13,226 --> 00:48:15,461
We need to go check
your living quarters?

638
00:48:17,697 --> 00:48:22,601
We'll see how you all like it the
next time I have to sew you up.

639
00:48:22,602 --> 00:48:25,137
You're always
getting out-drawn.

640
00:48:25,138 --> 00:48:28,407
How you gonna like it when
I have a needle and thread,

641
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:31,877
when I gotta take
some lead out of your ass?

642
00:48:33,546 --> 00:48:35,714
What are you saying, Doc?

643
00:48:35,715 --> 00:48:38,350
[Jim Dandy]
Doc's right, Bobcat.

644
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:41,553
We haven't seen you hit anything
you was aiming at in a long time.

645
00:48:41,554 --> 00:48:44,590
[laughing]

646
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,159
Doc's sewn you up
at least a half dozen times.

647
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,361
[laughing]

648
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:57,403
See what I mean?

649
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:03,642
You'd be having Doc pick lead from
you if Digger didn't get to you first.

650
00:49:03,643 --> 00:49:05,611
Hell, he's just telling
some truth.

651
00:49:08,014 --> 00:49:10,416
Doc's kept you from bleeding
to death on many occasion.

652
00:49:11,484 --> 00:49:13,052
All right, boys.

653
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:15,320
Just tell us where
the lady is, Doc.

654
00:49:15,321 --> 00:49:17,089
I honestly
don't know.

655
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,125
Hell, she's got to be
in town somewhere.

656
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:21,694
Let's go, boys.

657
00:49:21,695 --> 00:49:23,829
- You, too, Little Jack.
- [blows a kiss]

658
00:49:30,437 --> 00:49:32,471
I ain't
been shot yet.

659
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,240
No hard feelings.

660
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:46,885
This is unreasonable.

661
00:49:46,886 --> 00:49:50,322
How can we run a business
when people don't pay?

662
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:51,957
[Pete]
I'll talk to Victor.

663
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:55,327
- Victor?
- He's harsh, I know.

664
00:49:55,328 --> 00:49:57,529
But he's also
a businessman.

665
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,031
He'll listen to reason.

666
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:01,133
That Yankee mercenary
working for him

667
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:02,634
shows no respect.

668
00:50:02,635 --> 00:50:04,837
For anybody
or anything!

669
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:07,539
Pa, are we
gonna be okay?

670
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,274
You mind your chores, boy.

671
00:50:09,275 --> 00:50:12,011
Shh. We have customers.

672
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:15,681
[Betsy Mae] I'm terribly sorry.
Can I help you find anything?

673
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:18,650
[Violet] I'm picking up
a few little things.

674
00:50:18,651 --> 00:50:21,820
This is amazing that you
have all this in one place.

675
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:23,822
You've never been
to a general store?

676
00:50:23,823 --> 00:50:25,190
No.

677
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:28,227
My uncle and pa took me
to a trappers' gathering once,

678
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:30,729
but it was nothing
like this.

679
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:34,166
Pa? I think we got trouble.

680
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,644
So this is where
you've been hiding.

681
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,919
This horse is a nag.

682
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,520
You ought to let me
pick you a good horse.

683
00:50:57,924 --> 00:51:00,993
I just wanted to wish you
a happy birthday, son.

684
00:51:00,994 --> 00:51:03,062
Thank you.

685
00:51:04,397 --> 00:51:06,432
I've had a half dozen people
out trying to find you

686
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:08,901
so I could have
a word with you today.

687
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,571
I don't know why
you defy me so.

688
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:18,177
Isn't there something in that Good
Book about respecting thy father?

689
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,282
You trying to tell me now
that you've read the Good Book?

690
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:26,518
I've read a line
or two here and there.

691
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:28,787
I know we don't always
see eye to eye

692
00:51:28,788 --> 00:51:31,357
and I may not be
the ideal parent,

693
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:34,860
but I've always tried to provide
and help make you into a man.

694
00:51:34,861 --> 00:51:37,830
Yeah. You've helped me decide what
kind of man I never want to be.

695
00:51:37,831 --> 00:51:40,432
[laughing]
Will!

696
00:51:40,433 --> 00:51:44,703
These people don't respond to
all that religious guilt bullshit.

697
00:51:44,704 --> 00:51:47,806
They need authority from
someone who can give punishment.

698
00:51:47,807 --> 00:51:50,709
Direct punishment
and reward.

699
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:53,145
You sound like you're
trying to fill in for God.

700
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:55,547
- Is that what you're trying to do?
- Enough!

701
00:51:57,517 --> 00:52:00,519
I'm having a gathering
tonight at the Silver Dollar,

702
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,021
in your honor.

703
00:52:02,022 --> 00:52:05,958
And I have a surprise
or two for you.

704
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:08,761
That church bell you've been
wanting is one of them.

705
00:52:10,163 --> 00:52:11,430
I'm not demanding.

706
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:15,634
I'm asking my son
to please come tonight.

707
00:52:17,037 --> 00:52:19,872
Let's have just one night

708
00:52:19,873 --> 00:52:23,575
where we could put our differences
aside and be father and son.

709
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:28,614
Let's do it for your mother.

710
00:52:28,615 --> 00:52:31,016
I know she would
have wanted that.

711
00:52:31,017 --> 00:52:32,351
Agreed?

712
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:39,291
All right. Agreed.

713
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:43,062
- I'll be there.
- Great! Great.

714
00:52:43,063 --> 00:52:46,699
Six o'clock to whenever.
We'll have a grand old time.

715
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,802
- Need new clothes or anything?
- No, I'm good. Thank you.

716
00:52:49,803 --> 00:52:51,770
I'll see you
in a few hours, then.

717
00:52:52,939 --> 00:52:55,107
- You best get cleaned up.
- I will.

718
00:53:01,948 --> 00:53:04,750
Sure is pretty.
[cackling]

719
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:06,819
Like an unplucked flair.

720
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:12,224
- I need to be going now.
- She ain't goin' no-damn-where.

721
00:53:12,225 --> 00:53:14,860
- [Jim Dandy] Nope.
- What's going on here?

722
00:53:14,861 --> 00:53:17,429
- Let the girl go on her way!
- Shush, Betsy.

723
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,765
[Captain] I can see
this is gonna be difficult.

724
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:21,600
- Whiskey. Moose.
- [Moose] Let's go.

725
00:53:21,601 --> 00:53:24,269
- [laughing]
- [Violet shrieking]

726
00:53:26,573 --> 00:53:29,108
- [Violet whimpering]
- [Bobcat cackling]

727
00:53:32,746 --> 00:53:34,747
Take her to my office
and watch her.

728
00:53:34,748 --> 00:53:36,782
She gets away, I'm holding you
all personally responsible.

729
00:53:36,783 --> 00:53:38,817
She ain't goin' nowhere,
Mr. Burnett.

730
00:53:38,818 --> 00:53:42,755
[Victor, Jim Dandy laughing]

731
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:47,259
Makes you feel like
a little kid again.

732
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,095
[Mayor] Victor!
Hold on, fellas.

733
00:53:50,096 --> 00:53:52,398
You mind telling me
what's going on out here?

734
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:54,400
A bit of family business.

735
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:56,835
Victor. Now you
got to understand.

736
00:53:56,836 --> 00:54:00,706
It does not look good for people to
be dragged off the streets of this town

737
00:54:00,707 --> 00:54:02,775
in the middle
of broad daylight like that.

738
00:54:02,776 --> 00:54:08,113
[spitting] And it's bad for politicians
to be messin' with other folks' business.

739
00:54:08,114 --> 00:54:11,583
There are still laws
in this town, Mr. Burnett.

740
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:14,319
Let's all
just take it easy.

741
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,156
Mr. Burnett, sir, what right
do you have to take that girl?

742
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:19,425
- What right?
- [grunting]

743
00:54:19,426 --> 00:54:22,928
- [blows landing]
- [Deputy Tuck grunting]

744
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:26,498
You're trying to create
a job vacancy real fast.

745
00:54:26,499 --> 00:54:29,468
Digger would be happy to box you and
your amigo up, if that's what you want.

746
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:32,771
That girl's pa
murdered my family.

747
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:35,407
In my book,
that gives me every right.

748
00:54:35,408 --> 00:54:38,143
And if any of you
even question my actions again,

749
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:42,614
or get between me and
my business, I'll bury you!

750
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:45,217
- You understand?
- All right, now, Victor--

751
00:54:45,218 --> 00:54:48,554
- Get the hell out of here.
- Victor...

752
00:54:48,555 --> 00:54:50,189
W-We're stepping away.

753
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,091
[Mayor]
Stepping away right now.

754
00:54:52,092 --> 00:54:53,826
Copperhead!
Copperhead, come on!

755
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,163
Come on!

756
00:55:24,758 --> 00:55:26,258
Harmon.

757
00:55:26,259 --> 00:55:28,193
Wake up.

758
00:55:32,532 --> 00:55:35,100
Susie?

759
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:37,136
I do not have long, my love.

760
00:55:37,137 --> 00:55:38,971
[whimpers]

761
00:55:40,173 --> 00:55:43,575
You will be faced
with a serious choice

762
00:55:43,576 --> 00:55:46,679
that has serious consequences
attached to it.

763
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,215
How will I know what to do?

764
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:56,388
I shot those men dead,

765
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:59,158
chopped 'em in the head
with a ax.

766
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:01,660
And then I shot
that poor old woman dead.

767
00:56:01,661 --> 00:56:04,496
Huh.

768
00:56:04,497 --> 00:56:07,232
- How can I do anything any worse?
- Shh!

769
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:10,636
I know what you did
and why you did it.

770
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:20,579
- Hold on, old friend.
- [groaning]

771
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,681
Everything will be okay.

772
00:56:31,057 --> 00:56:32,958
[groaning continues]

773
00:56:43,036 --> 00:56:44,870
[groaning continues]

774
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:05,391
[thunderclap]

775
00:57:08,094 --> 00:57:10,429
Violet?

776
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,765
Where the hell are you?

777
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:18,103
Very strong.

778
00:57:18,104 --> 00:57:20,305
You put in his drink,

779
00:57:20,306 --> 00:57:22,808
and he will be...

780
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:26,045
How you say?

781
00:57:26,046 --> 00:57:28,313
More relaxed.

782
00:57:28,314 --> 00:57:31,083
Much more relaxed.

783
00:57:31,084 --> 00:57:35,587
Influence will be
much more easy.

784
00:57:35,588 --> 00:57:37,890
Hmm.

785
00:57:37,891 --> 00:57:39,858
Thank you.

786
00:57:45,899 --> 00:57:47,266
Who's she?

787
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:55,140
That, my dear...

788
00:57:55,141 --> 00:57:59,244
is the daughter of the man
who murdered my family.

789
00:57:59,245 --> 00:58:02,581
[thunderclap]

790
00:58:09,956 --> 00:58:12,791
- [whimpering]
- And he's still alive, isn't he?

791
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:18,364
After all these years,
he's alive.

792
00:58:18,365 --> 00:58:22,401
He's sent himself away like
a coward after what he did.

793
00:58:22,402 --> 00:58:24,737
- [whimpering]
- Well, I intend to find him.

794
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:30,075
And you, my dear,
are going to tell me where.

795
00:58:32,178 --> 00:58:34,346
Now...

796
00:58:34,347 --> 00:58:38,350
I must go downstairs
to greet our guests.

797
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:41,186
And, honestly,

798
00:58:41,187 --> 00:58:43,956
I don't trust anyone else
to watch over you,

799
00:58:43,957 --> 00:58:46,425
save the good captain here,

800
00:58:46,426 --> 00:58:50,129
because I pay him very well.

801
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,264
Captain,

802
00:58:52,265 --> 00:58:54,767
please help yourself
to any of the brandy.

803
00:58:54,768 --> 00:58:56,301
I'll be back shortly.

804
00:59:00,373 --> 00:59:04,343
Birthday. Oh, it's sure
a good reason for a drink.

805
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:06,245
[laughs]

806
00:59:06,246 --> 00:59:09,648
Dandy with all diamonds.

807
00:59:09,649 --> 00:59:11,917
That's twice, Mr. Walters.

808
00:59:11,918 --> 00:59:14,920
[laughs]
