1
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:12,567
JAMES:
I was born James Aherne, Jr.

2
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:14,500
This is my story,

3
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:17,133
The story
of how I became War Bonnet,

4
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,767
Son of Yellow Eagle.

5
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:21,667
A white boy who grew up
to be an Indian.

6
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:23,600
My hair is dark now.

7
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,500
When I was 11,
it was sandy yellow.

8
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:29,067
1868 was the year.

9
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:32,900
Our wagon train was passing
through the Black Hills,

10
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,567
Indian country.

11
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:38,500
There were buffalos,
great herds of them.

12
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:41,100
But I could only look.
I mustn't reach for a gun.

13
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:44,367
For this was Sioux country,
the scouts said.

14
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,100
And the Sioux had signed
a peace treaty

15
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:47,533
With the government.

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,700
We were free
to pass through their land

17
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:53,467
Only if we obeyed the rules
made by these hostiles.

18
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:56,800
That's what the scout called
Indians.

19
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,400
My father
was a schoolmaster.

20
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:02,900
A good man, kind and brave.

21
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:05,867
We'd come west
to build a new home.

22
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:08,500
There wasn't much left
of the old one after the war

23
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,767
Between the states.

24
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,867
But even here,
2,000 miles from Virginia,

25
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,267
Dad never forgot
the importance of books.

26
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,133
The wagon
was his classroom.

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,533
Sometimes
there were regular lessons.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,133
Reading, writing
and arithmetic.

29
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,133
But most of the time,
he would read to us.

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,067
Maybe because he knew
we liked it better.

31
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:33,300
Old poems,
stories of great adventure,

32
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:34,867
Over and over.

33
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:38,433
Some of them I still know
by heart.

34
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,800
I guess
I'll never forget them.

35
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:43,967
Nor the sound of his voice
as he read.

36
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:48,200
This was the last time
Dad was ever to read to me.

37
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:50,200
(Crows screaming)

38
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:52,333
(Dramatic theme playing)

39
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:33,767
JAMES:
I didn't know then
that these Indians

40
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,567
Weren't the Sioux
who had made the treaty.

41
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,667
They were Crows
raiding Sioux territory.

42
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:40,200
They hated the Sioux

43
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:42,400
For having made peace
with the white man.

44
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:43,733
(Ominous theme playing)

45
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:50,833
(Sioux Indians screaming)

46
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,467
More Indians came.
Many more Indians.

47
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,933
Sioux Indians.

48
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:58,067
And they chased
the murderers away.

49
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:10,267
The Crow had done a good job
in the wagon train.

50
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,667
I was the only one left.

51
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:18,733
I wasn't trying
to be brave.

52
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,567
I was just scared enough
to fight back.

53
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,500
It was the Sioux chief,
Yellow Eagle,

54
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,167
Who came at me first.

55
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:35,167
He grabbed the spear,
then he began to talk to me.

56
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,567
I didn't know what he was
saying because at that time,

57
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:39,533
I didn't understand
the language of the Sioux.

58
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,567
I was really frightened.

59
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,867
But there was something
in his voice,

60
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:47,700
Something that said maybe
he wasn't going to harm me.

61
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:49,867
Then an argument started.
I was sure it was about me,

62
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,500
That the others wanted
to kill me.

63
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:54,900
Running Dog had taken a scalp
from the Crow

64
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,900
Who laid dead
next to my father.

65
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:58,600
Did he want mine next?

66
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:01,533
And that's when Yellow Eagle
did a strange thing.

67
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,100
He made Running Dog
give the scalp to me.

68
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,667
It was mine
because I had killed the Crow.

69
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:09,367
In his eyes,
I was a warrior,

70
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:12,667
And he gave me the name
War Bonnet.

71
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:15,767
I wasn't frightened
anymore.

72
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,500
All I wanted to do
was to bury my father.

73
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:36,700
(Melancholic theme
playing)

74
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:55,200
"So be it written
in the Book of Love,

75
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:59,567
"I care not
about the Book Above.

76
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:04,700
"Erase my name
or write it as you will.

77
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:08,733
So be it written
in the Book of Love."

78
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,600
By Omar Khayyam.

79
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,433
Amen.

80
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,533
(Upbeat theme playing)

81
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,833
If the council says war,

82
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,300
Will you fight against
the white men, War Bonnet?

83
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:37,333
Only women
ask foolish questions.

84
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Am I not Yellow Eagle's son?

85
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:44,767
I am your friend.
It is my right to ask.

86
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,733
If it were two days journey
from a mountain,

87
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,233
Would you ask what you will do
when you get to the mountain?

88
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,600
You wait to get there.

89
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:08,267
To cross a mountain,
you can go two ways.

90
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,067
Up or around.

91
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,433
If the council says war,

92
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,733
There is only one way
a Sioux can go.

93
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,667
I will follow the way
of Yellow Eagle.

94
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:20,067
I am glad.

95
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:23,300
While you two talk and dream
in the sunlight,

96
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:25,567
Others have gone after
a herd of wild ponies.

97
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:28,100
Running Dog will catch
the best ones for himself.

98
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:31,133
And who will teach Running Dog
which are the best?

99
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,900
Hurry,
before they're all gone.

100
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,300
And remember,

101
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,667
You must catch a white one.
You promised that.

102
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:40,467
I will capture
a white one for you, Luta.

103
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:42,700
The white pony
will be yours.

104
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:46,233
Now you have two promises,
little sister.

105
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,433
Little sister.

106
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,067
Man of stone.
Man who sees no woman.

107
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,333
Man of no love.

108
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:01,233
Blind one.

109
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,567
(Horses neigh)

110
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,667
(Horses neigh)

111
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,433
(Horse neighs)

112
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,267
War Bonnet always gets
the best.

113
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,867
Because he is the best.

114
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:18,500
Is that how Luta feels?

115
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,133
Luta will smile on you

116
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,433
Like the moon smiles
on the snow.

117
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,767
The pony is yours.

118
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,267
I give you back
your own words.

119
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,567
I am your friend,

120
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,867
I have the right
to give you this gift.

121
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:46,900
Take him.

122
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:49,267
But you promised Luta
that you would...

123
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,633
Could a brother bring gifts
to his sister?

124
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,433
It will come better
from you.

125
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,667
When you give him to Luta,
make certain I am not near.

126
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:06,100
Why?

127
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,600
Because when I see you looking
like a lovesick calf,

128
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:09,800
I will laugh out loud

129
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:12,667
And Luta will take a stick
to me.

130
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,733
Tomorrow's council will be
the biggest in memory.

131
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,333
No bigger
than the one 15 summers ago.

132
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,267
I was there.

133
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,200
White Thunder himself
will speak tomorrow.

134
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,833
I learn words
from greater chiefs.

135
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,300
They say even the white men
fear him.

136
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:46,800
They say.

137
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:49,367
Small men easily give
the name of greatness

138
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:51,033
To feel less small
themselves.

139
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,333
(Chuckles)

140
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,867
My Pehangi speaks wisdom.

141
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:57,367
And I do not like
stupid talk of war.

142
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:59,633
My Pehangi also
talks too much.

143
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,267
That is a fine shield
you make for War Bonnet.

144
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,467
Will he use it
against the whites?

145
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,467
War Bonnet is my son.
My enemies are his.

146
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,067
He is ready to fight.

147
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,833
To fight Crows.

148
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,767
His heart does not forget,
they killed his father.

149
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,533
I am his father.

150
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,467
Does his heart forget
that his people were white?

151
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,233
You speak like Running Dog
who hates him.

152
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,900
No.

153
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:32,800
That is not true.
But my eyes are clear.

154
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:35,300
I say
War Bonnet will not fight

155
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,400
Against his own people.

156
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,433
(Dramatic theme playing)

157
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:20,133
My shield will be the finest
at the council.

158
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,833
We will be there soon.

159
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,167
I have words to say to you
before the council sits.

160
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:30,067
It is said the white soldiers
have broken the treaty.

161
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:31,867
If we go to war,

162
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:34,867
I would want you
to ride at my side.

163
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:39,133
That is why I made you
this shield.

164
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,600
My son,
I ask only one thing.

165
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:46,767
Do not bring disgrace
to my name.

166
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,267
The white men are our friends.

167
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,333
Have they not told us so?

168
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,133
In our treaty,

169
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,400
They said our people could live
forever in peace and friendship

170
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,667
In the Black Hills.

171
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:12,833
They said we could hunt
in peace and friendship

172
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,500
As far south
as the great river.

173
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:20,333
They said their soldiers
would protect us

174
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,833
Against other white men

175
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,100
Who might seek
to steal our land,

176
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,633
Spoil our hunting.

177
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,333
Those are the things
they promised.

178
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,833
This is the treaty

179
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,700
I, White Thunder,
signed in blood.

180
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:44,533
But the white men
found yellow iron

181
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,267
In the Black Hills.

182
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,067
They built an iron road
across our land

183
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:50,900
And brought the iron horse.

184
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:55,533
Some of our people
try to stop these white men.

185
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,200
The soldiers came
as they had promised.

186
00:13:58,267 --> 00:14:03,300
But they were not the soldiers
who made the treaty.

187
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:06,500
Their chiefs
were not the chiefs

188
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,800
Who signed the treaty.

189
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:13,767
They punished our people
who try to stop these invaders.

190
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:18,333
They drove our people
from our hills.

191
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,333
But do not be angry
at the white men.

192
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,667
Remember,
they are our friends.

193
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:26,700
Soon they will be coming
to protect you.

194
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:29,667
To take you
to the reservations.

195
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:34,067
They will give you cow beef
and white flour to eat.

196
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,733
You will hunt no more.

197
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,467
They will take away
your weapons and ponies.

198
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,700
In peace and friendship,

199
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:44,767
You who were once
great warriors

200
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:48,267
Will sit by the fire
and mumble stories

201
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,800
To your grandchildren.

202
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:55,267
And they will laugh
behind your bent backs.

203
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,767
But the grandchildren
of White Thunder

204
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,133
Will not laugh.

205
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,833
They will know that
White Thunder and the Oglalas

206
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,933
Stayed behind to hunt and fight.
TRIBESMAN: Yeah.

207
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:09,667
Let Yellow Eagle speak
for the Miniconjou.

208
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:24,867
I am chief
of all the Miniconjou.

209
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:28,467
I too was at Horse Creek
at the signing of the treaty.

210
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,067
And before that,

211
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:34,633
My lance was hurled in battle
against the soldiers.

212
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,733
White Thunder has said
he and the Oglalas will fight.

213
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,067
That is good.

214
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:43,567
It is better to fight
than surrender your land.

215
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:47,700
The Oglalas are a proud part
of the great Sioux nation.

216
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,933
And so are the Miniconjou.

217
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:51,433
Our boundaries are marked

218
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,167
By the blood and bones
of our fathers

219
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:56,567
Who fought to hold our land.

220
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:58,800
But I say to you...

221
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:01,367
Let us be certain
the treaty has been broken

222
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:03,067
Before we take
to the warpath.

223
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,900
Does Yellow Eagle speak thus
because his son is a white man?

224
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,800
Will War Bonnet speak
for himself?

225
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:28,267
Is it the pigment
of a man's skin

226
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,400
Which makes him
a Miniconjou?

227
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:33,933
A member
of the mighty Sioux?

228
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,200
Is it the color of his eyes?

229
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:40,200
No, neither of these things.

230
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,367
It is the beating
inside his body.

231
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,633
The throbbing inside
which tells him

232
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,067
How great is the love
he has for his father.

233
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,767
For his mother, his sister.

234
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:56,700
For all these blood brothers
and friends.

235
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,733
And it is this same love

236
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,667
Which demands the truth
for his loved ones,

237
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:07,067
Which demands that he does not
spill their blood,

238
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,833
Sioux blood,

239
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,367
Because of rumors.

240
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:15,767
How do we know
the treaty has been broken?

241
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,533
Which of you
with his own eyes

242
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,867
Has seen the white soldiers
on the warpath

243
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:21,067
Against the Sioux?

244
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:22,433
White Thunder has said it.

245
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,867
WAR BONNET:
White Thunder has said it,

246
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:26,100
But White Thunder
has not seen it.

247
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,333
We must first know the white
soldiers are our enemies

248
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,967
Before we spill blood.

249
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:35,733
He speaks with the smoothness
of the white man.

250
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,600
But I fight with the courage
of a Sioux.

251
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,633
At the council
it is said

252
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,233
All may speak
their minds openly.

253
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,367
And it is said
that the coyote speaks

254
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:47,600
From the protection
of the pack.

255
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:51,367
My son has spoken wisdom
that is old.

256
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:55,933
Now I speak
for all the Miniconjou.

257
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:59,800
I say we wait and learn
if the white soldiers want war.

258
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:01,700
I say to fight now

259
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:04,333
Would be to the liking
of our enemies, the black Crows.

260
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,800
It is so. We must
not fight two enemies.

261
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:13,067
How will the Miniconjou learn
if the white soldiers seek war?

262
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:15,400
Will you go to them and ask?

263
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:20,867
My son will go.

264
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,533
He knows the tongue
of his childhood.

265
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,067
He will go to the fort
beyond the big river.

266
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:31,133
He will listen
and see with his eyes.

267
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,533
And he will learn.

268
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,467
How long must we wait
for this knowledge?

269
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,767
We will not wait too long.

270
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,300
Two moons?

271
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:43,667
Two moons.

272
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:52,800
We will wait two moons.
No more.

273
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,667
(All speaking
indistinctly)

274
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,367
(Gunshots)

275
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,400
(Gunshots and Crows
shouting indistinctly)

276
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:56,733
SOLDIER:
Get down! Come on, get down!

277
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,567
Go, lads!

278
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:09,533
(Firing stops)

279
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,867
SOLDIER:
Them Crows are tricky.

280
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,767
What do you think?

281
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,300
They're still out there,
Lieutenant.

282
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,067
Well, we just have to try
and hold out till dark

283
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:46,267
And then
make a run for it.

284
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,767
If we last that long.

285
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,467
Sarge is right. They'll
cut us down one at a time.

286
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:52,567
Comes dark, it'll be more
than one at a time.

287
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:55,300
They can see real good
in the dark.

288
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:57,833
(Indian screams)

289
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:03,333
We got friends in there.

290
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,367
(Gunshots)

291
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:46,900
I'm Lieutenant Hathersall.
Fort Duane.

292
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,367
Here, let me fix
that cut for you.

293
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:08,200
Here, use this.

294
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:11,500
Where are your friends,
mister?

295
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,733
I'd like to thank them for
pulling us out of this hole.

296
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,367
I'm alone.

297
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,133
It ain't possible.

298
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,733
They're gone, Lieutenant.
What's left of them.

299
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,500
There's dead Indians
all over the woods.

300
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:25,067
All with a knife and arrow.

301
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,433
Who are you, mister?

302
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,933
My name is Aherne.
Jim Aherne.

303
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:34,467
I'm taking some ponies
to the fort to sell.

304
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,933
Just a minute, Mr. Aherne.
White men don't take scalps.

305
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:44,400
I do.

306
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:48,200
I take Crow scalps.

307
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,833
WESTON:
So you can imagine
my surprise, sir,

308
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,133
When he said he was alone.

309
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,733
Well, let's have a look

310
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,933
At this one-man army,
Hathersall.

311
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,833
Do we keep our hair covered?

312
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,100
A lot of white trappers
take scalps, Vaugant.

313
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:08,367
Out there with the Indians,

314
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:09,967
They learn
to keep their own scalp

315
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:11,533
And take the other fellow's.

316
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,400
No different than our own
souvenir-hunting soldiers.

317
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:16,533
Let him in, orderly.

318
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,567
Will you come in, sir?

319
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:27,633
I'm Colonel Ellis,
Mr. Aherne.

320
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,967
Captain Vaugant.

321
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:35,200
You have our thanks
and compliments, Mr. Aherne.

322
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:38,400
I intend sending a full report
to the War Department.

323
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:40,067
You'll receive
a proper commendation

324
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:41,833
Through official channels.

325
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,333
Won't you sit down?

326
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:55,633
What can I do for you
to show our gratitude?

327
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,067
There's talk you'll soon go on
the warpath against the Sioux.

328
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:01,767
You'd like some action
with us, is that it?

329
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,667
I'm sorry,
I can't promise you that.

330
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,600
See, we have a treaty
with the hostiles.

331
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:07,333
Hostiles?
The Indians.

332
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,067
We're waiting to hear
from Washington

333
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:10,433
Whether the hostiles
are willing

334
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,067
To let civilization
move further west.

335
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,633
This is Sioux country.

336
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,767
We can't let a mob of savages
hold back progress.

337
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:19,733
Oh, remember, Captain,
we have a treaty.

338
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
We'll sit here
and twiddle our thumbs

339
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:24,767
Until Washington
tells us otherwise.

340
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:28,200
Oh, from what Hathersall
tells me, Aherne,

341
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,500
We could use a man like you

342
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:31,633
If Washington orders us
to march.

343
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,867
When will you know?
Soon I hope.

344
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:36,267
We have to wait
through official channels.

345
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,067
That's the way of the Army,
you know.

346
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,333
Oh, Hathersall,

347
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,067
See that Mr. Aherne gets
whatever he needs.

348
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:44,733
All the comforts
of the post.

349
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,967
Yes, sir.

350
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,167
WESTON:
Tally, if you'd rather not
go through with it...

351
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,633
Fine time to tell me.

352
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,933
Come here, Arnold,
and make yourself useful.

353
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:04,933
That big dish.

354
00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:07,533
And two of the small ones.

355
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,967
Now take them
into the kitchen.

356
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:12,167
I can always make
some kind of explanation.

357
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:14,867
Well, you invited him.
Besides dinner is cooked.

358
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:17,200
I refuse to be cheated
out of one of your dinners.

359
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:19,633
That chair too, Arnold,
please.

360
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,567
Does he eat
cooked food, Wes?

361
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:25,400
Tally, after all,
he's a white man.

362
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:26,867
How do you know?

363
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:29,533
You'd have to scrape off
some of that dirt to see.

364
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,967
Tally,

365
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:33,600
You think we can trust Weston's
dinner guest with a knife?

366
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,533
Oh, I think
maybe we can take...

367
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:43,400
Civilized people
don't listen in

368
00:25:43,467 --> 00:25:45,800
On private conversations,
Mr. Aherne.

369
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:49,367
Savages speak their insults
to a man's face.

370
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:51,767
TALLY:
Arnold, please.

371
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:55,733
I'm Tally, Mr. Aherne.
Weston's sister.

372
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,633
WESTON:
Come in, Aherne. Come in.

373
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,533
Weston, maybe Mr. Aherne will
have some port before dinner.

374
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,800
You bet, some port it is.

375
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:10,800
I'm sorry,
but we'll be busy this evening.

376
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:12,167
Good night, Captain.

377
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:14,967
If you'd prefer to have dinner
with that savage.

378
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:17,567
TALLY: Let him go. Let him go.
WESTON: Aherne, stop it.

379
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:19,767
Stop it, you hear me?

380
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:28,333
I'll have you in a cell
for this.

381
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,633
No, Captain.
If you try that,

382
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,967
I'll have to tell the entire
story to Colonel Ellis.

383
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:42,333
I'm sorry, Aherne. Jim.

384
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,833
Vaugant didn't mean
all that.

385
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,867
Then he speaks things
only to please his friends.

386
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,200
I think we need
some port.

387
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:56,367
Well, you see, so little
ever happens here in the post.

388
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:59,300
Well, you're coming here
and all,

389
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,733
It's just something
to gossip about.

390
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,333
Makes so-called
smart conversation.

391
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,200
Well, I mean...

392
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,767
I'll see to the dinner.

393
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:15,867
I eat cooked meat,
Miss Hathersall.

394
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,833
Yes, of course.

395
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,467
Naturally.

396
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:22,667
I deserved that.

397
00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:27,533
You see, I was just as guilty
of making smart conversation.

398
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:40,367
Thanks for what you did for us
this morning, Jim.

399
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:47,900
Berry juice.

400
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,567
(Melancholic theme
playing)

401
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,267
Just a few minutes now.

402
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:04,067
Have you read it,
Mr. Aherne?

403
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,333
A long time ago.

404
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:14,100
"I care not
about that Book Above.

405
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:18,233
Erase my name
or write it as you will."

406
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:26,333
(Slow theme playing)

407
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,233
It is not long
until the second moon.

408
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:37,700
He will come.

409
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:41,300
Sometimes I think War Bonnet
has found new friends,

410
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:44,767
New blood brothers,
among the whites.

411
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,267
You do not speak
as his friend?

412
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:50,333
I do not mean it
to sound that way.

413
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:53,100
When I am with you, Luta,

414
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:57,333
The thoughts inside my head
has to be told.

415
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,933
You do not feel the love
I have for you.

416
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:03,367
It is a love
which wants to share all.

417
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:05,967
Even the smallest thoughts.

418
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:10,300
I do not feel love

419
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:13,433
For one who speaks
of War Bonnet as a traitor.

420
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:21,133
WESTON:
* All jump up
And never come down *

421
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,700
* Swing that pretty girl
Round and round *

422
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:24,967
* Swing her feet
Right off the ground *

423
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,300
* Now, men, left... *

424
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:29,567
Wes, do you like Jim Aherne?

425
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:32,867
When you ask
an offhand question like that,

426
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:36,700
I need time
to weigh my answer.

427
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:40,067
Why is Tally asking me?

428
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,200
What's she after?

429
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:45,633
Should I commit myself
or no?

430
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,967
You better commit yourself.
Ow. I confess.

431
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:50,500
I like him.

432
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:53,467
I have reason to.

433
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:58,067
But you, you have
your pick around here.

434
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:00,000
Why Jim Aherne?

435
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:03,167
It's gonna be
a lovely evening, won't it?

436
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:05,933
* Oh, ladies to the center
Back to back *

437
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,300
* Gentlemen... *

438
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:08,800
(Square dance music
playing)

439
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:11,600
MAN:
* Drop that gait
And make it eight *

440
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:13,467
* And the men left
With the old left hand *

441
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:15,333
* Right to your honey
With the right-left band *

442
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,033
* Here we go
With the old man's wagon *

443
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,733
* Five wheels off
And the axle draggin' *

444
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,667
* Meet your honey
And you pat her on the head *

445
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:22,433
* If she don't like that
Speed to code red *

446
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,667
* Promenade home
Two by two *

447
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:27,633
* Bow to your partner
Corners all *

448
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,200
* That's it, boys
That's it, that's all *

449
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:33,333
(Indistinct chattering
and cheering)

450
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,500
Where do you suppose he is?
I haven't seen him.

451
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:42,000
I don't know.
I haven't seen him.

452
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:43,933
(Indistinct chattering)

453
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,267
(Upbeat waltz music
playing)

454
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:17,767
May I have the next dance,
Mr. Aherne?

455
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:22,067
"Why, yes, Miss Hathersall.
You may have this next dance."

456
00:31:22,133 --> 00:31:23,967
(Upbeat waltz music
continues playing)

457
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,500
That's it.
Just forget your feet.

458
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,133
You dance on wings.

459
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,833
It's a beautiful night,
isn't it?

460
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:41,533
The Sioux have a saying

461
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,633
That a beautiful face
is more wonderful to look on

462
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,067
Than all the sights
in the sky.

463
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:52,067
We'll be missed inside.
We better go.

464
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,167
If we don't go,

465
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:58,067
There'll be all kinds
of gossip.

466
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:08,067
Well, you do have to help me,
you know.

467
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,367
No, Jim. Not like that.

468
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:14,833
Here,
put your hands together.

469
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,300
Bend down
then take my foot.

470
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:20,833
Now, when I say go,
give me a boost.

471
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,367
Now go.

472
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:24,833
Thank you.

473
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,800
Now put my foot
in the stirrup.

474
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:29,133
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Here, I'll take that, Jim.

475
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,533
Fine chaperone you are.

476
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,367
Well, blame the colonel.
He's worried.

477
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:33,500
Anything wrong?

478
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:35,233
There was a three-man patrol
due in at dawn.

479
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,967
They haven't come in yet.

480
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:39,400
The colonel may want you later
to help pick up their trail.

481
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:42,633
After the picnic,
Mr. Hathersall.

482
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,633
How do you pick up trails?

483
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:51,167
Well, the prints of a horse
tell you about the rider.

484
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:55,533
The soldier's horse is shod.
Indian's is not.

485
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,567
If the prints are deep
in the trail,

486
00:32:57,633 --> 00:32:59,600
The horse was carrying
a heavy load.

487
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:02,167
The spacing of the prints tells
you how fast it was going.

488
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:04,500
Suppose
we get going.

489
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,100
The best spot for a picnic's
the foot of the hill.

490
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,200
Close to the fort.

491
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,333
(Ominous theme playing)

492
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,767
What is it?

493
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,433
A smoke signal.

494
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,533
Can you tell
what they're saying?

495
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,167
I have to leave.

496
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:58,867
Jim, will it be for long?

497
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:00,800
I don't know.

498
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:03,567
You will come back?

499
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:04,967
Yes, I'll come back.

500
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,567
(Suspenseful theme
playing)

501
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:33,667
(Cooing)

502
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:36,400
I'm here, Long Mane.

503
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:41,400
This is Luta's necklace.
Where is she?

504
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:44,100
Crows, 14 graves.

505
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,267
They took Luta
from the soldiers.

506
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,133
She was going to the fort
to find you.

507
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,967
Your friends,
the white soldiers.

508
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:52,333
Was is not you
who said,

509
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,933
"Which of you
with his own eyes

510
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:55,800
"Has seen the white soldiers
on the warpath

511
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:57,067
Against the Sioux?"

512
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:58,467
You are a man
of too many words.

513
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:00,633
We will have to ride hard
through the night

514
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,333
To reach the Crow camp.

515
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,167
When the sun rises tomorrow,
Luta will die.

516
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:08,367
But we are so few.
We are enough.

517
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:47,633
Dogs will smell us
and bark.

518
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,467
They have no dogs.
They would bark at the moon.

519
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:53,067
I can see the white pony.

520
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:54,933
I say we go home
and make up a big war party.

521
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:57,200
She's my sister,
I say we will not wait.

522
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:59,867
And I say
we will not wait.

523
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:01,233
What's is it we must do?

524
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,067
You and Jumping Calf
will come with me

525
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:04,567
To stampede their ponies.

526
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:06,333
Help me get Luta away.

527
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,867
We will come back this way.

528
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:10,467
Your guns will covers us
from here.

529
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:02,867
We are fools
to be led by fools.

530
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:04,867
We risk death
from the darkness.

531
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,533
For a woman.

532
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,433
They'll never leave
the Crow camp alive.

533
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,233
We wait here to die.

534
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,833
What would we say
to Yellow Eagle?

535
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,067
Say that Long Mane
and Jumping Calf

536
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,067
Followed Luta to the fort
and were killed by soldiers.

537
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:21,967
Who will be alive
to say this is a lie?

538
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,433
She must be
in the medicine lodge.

539
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,067
Cut the hobbles
on those ponies. Be ready.

540
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,233
(Horse snorts)

541
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:11,833
Luta. Luta.

542
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:17,533
Here. Here.

543
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,633
War Bonnet.
I prayed for you to come.

544
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,333
WAR BONNET:
Shh.

545
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,900
(Screams)

546
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:40,833
Hurry!

547
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,700
(Shouting indistinctly
and horses neighing)

548
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:44,833
(Suspenseful theme playing)

549
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,733
(Crows shouting indistinctly
and horses neighing)

550
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,467
(Shouts)

551
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:59,200
Hyah!

552
00:39:59,267 --> 00:40:01,100
Hyah!

553
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,333
(Horses neighing)

554
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,467
(Ominous theme playing)

555
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:21,500
(Crows shouting indistinctly)

556
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,400
(Gunshots)

557
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:42,000
Take the forest trail, go.

558
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,067
(Gunshots)

559
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:51,967
(Shouting indistinctly)

560
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:56,167
Where are Running Dog
and Standing Bear?

561
00:40:56,233 --> 00:40:57,400
Ask the wind.

562
00:40:57,467 --> 00:41:00,467
Those great warriors
of the big voices.

563
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:04,500
Look.

564
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:16,500
(Dramatic theme playing)

565
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:43,100
(Shouting indistinctly)

566
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:49,300
The Crows chase shadows.

567
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:50,700
Come, we've far to go.

568
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:53,567
To the fort?
We're going home.

569
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,767
(Melancholic theme
playing)

570
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:05,067
Washington
will keep on pussyfooting

571
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:07,700
With these savages
until we're all wiped out.

572
00:42:07,767 --> 00:42:09,700
There's only one solution,
exterminate.

573
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:11,300
Burn out their villages.

574
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:15,367
It's the only way to bring
civilization to these parts.

575
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:28,400
Hostiles.
Four of them, with guns.

576
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:30,067
Take all but the detail
into the woods.

577
00:42:30,067 --> 00:42:31,633
No shooting
until I give the order.

578
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,367
There may be more of them.

579
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:35,967
All but the detail
into the woods.

580
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:00,067
They have found their dead.

581
00:43:00,133 --> 00:43:01,433
(Gun cocks)

582
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,833
There is nothing to fear,
I will tell them what happened.

583
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,700
No, please.
They will not listen.

584
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:09,767
They will recognize me,
they will listen.

585
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:12,500
They are not our friends.
They took Luta.

586
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:16,067
Not all soldiers
are like those three.

587
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,533
Do not fear, little sister.
Come.

588
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,900
(Ominous theme playing)

589
00:43:31,633 --> 00:43:33,733
You men right here,
prepare to fire.

590
00:43:45,267 --> 00:43:47,267
LONG MANE:
Luta.

591
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,067
To the woods, quick.

592
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,900
(Melancholic theme
playing)

593
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:46,833
Ohh!

594
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:52,600
(Pehangi whimpering)

595
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:56,433
Soldiers did this.

596
00:44:58,067 --> 00:45:00,367
I led her to them.

597
00:45:00,433 --> 00:45:03,867
I told her to have no fear.

598
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:05,267
I did this.

599
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:09,733
The soldiers fired their guns
though we came in peace.

600
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,733
Take her. She's cold.

601
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,533
(Pehangi whimpering)

602
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,100
(Pehangi sobbing)

603
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:24,167
From this day forth,
let no man call me white.

604
00:45:24,233 --> 00:45:27,233
Let no man say to me
the white man is his friend.

605
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,500
You must rest, my son.

606
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:31,100
I do not rest
till I have done that

607
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:32,833
That shall cool my blood.

608
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,833
Nor do I.

609
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,167
It's our fight, Long Mane.
No.

610
00:45:42,233 --> 00:45:44,600
It is the law
of our people.

611
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,067
You who ran away.
Hear me.

612
00:45:55,067 --> 00:46:00,533
I call you traitors.
I call you cowards!

613
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,133
You who ran home and lied.

614
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:06,333
You now hide
with the women?

615
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,133
Must I drag you
from your lodge

616
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,367
And beat you
from the camp?

617
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,500
(Dramatic theme playing)

618
00:46:16,933 --> 00:46:20,067
Get your lance and pony
and face me.

619
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,067
May you...

620
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:52,867
He who has lived without honor,
must die without honor.

621
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:56,167
It is the law.
It is just.

622
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:58,533
Now do you give the word
for war, Yellow Eagle?

623
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,367
May I speak, my Father?

624
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:03,100
At the great council,

625
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:06,067
I talked against war
with the soldiers.

626
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:09,433
Now I know
my tongue was foolish.

627
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,800
My eyes were blinded

628
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:14,367
Because of the pigment
of my skin.

629
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:17,267
Now I know
they come to kill.

630
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,900
And I say
the killing to be done

631
00:47:18,967 --> 00:47:20,733
Shall be done
by the Miniconjou.

632
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,167
By all Sioux.
ALL: Yeah. Yeah.

633
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:25,067
I am ready.
And I.

634
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,233
My son speaks
for all the Miniconjou.

635
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,300
ALL:
Yeah.

636
00:47:29,367 --> 00:47:32,700
It is good.
Now hear me.

637
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,967
It is the cunning wolf
who lives to old age.

638
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:37,833
The soldiers
have many horses.

639
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,100
They will come fast,
they have powerful guns.

640
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:43,067
I say hear me!

641
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:46,800
Many of these horses
and guns can be ours.

642
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:49,167
I have thought long
about this,

643
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,467
And I have thought well.

644
00:47:53,067 --> 00:47:56,067
With no paint
and no feathers,

645
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:59,767
The soldiers see you
as one of them.

646
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:03,100
Tell them you will guide them
to the Sioux camps.

647
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:07,467
Then bring them to where
we will be waiting.

648
00:48:08,633 --> 00:48:10,700
(Crowd murmuring)

649
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:15,600
(Military bugle playing)

650
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:22,700
Tally, put those things
in my saddle bag?

651
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:24,667
They're all fixed
on your bed.

652
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:27,167
Oh, Jim's back.
He's going with us.

653
00:48:27,233 --> 00:48:31,133
Where is he?
With the colonel and Vaugant.

654
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,067
And no time to work
any more charm on him, sis,

655
00:48:33,133 --> 00:48:34,600
We're moving out
in a few minutes.

656
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:36,467
All but two platoons
are going along.

657
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:38,067
Ah, there's nothing
to this one.

658
00:48:38,133 --> 00:48:40,233
It shouldn't take long.

659
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,067
Catch Jim outside.
He knows where to find me.

660
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,733
Oh.

661
00:49:04,533 --> 00:49:09,100
Aren't you gonna say goodbye?
Of course I am.

662
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:12,400
What kind of souvenirs would
you like from the savages?

663
00:49:12,467 --> 00:49:14,433
Just come back safely.
All of you.

664
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,833
Excuse me.

665
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,200
(Horse neighs)

666
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:21,667
All right, Captain, I'll read
the orders to the formation.

667
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:24,400
Sergeant,
march your troops.

668
00:49:24,467 --> 00:49:27,400
Platoon, come out!

669
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:31,933
I thought you might wanna
take this with you.

670
00:49:34,067 --> 00:49:35,900
When did you return
to the fort?

671
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:37,567
Last night.

672
00:49:37,633 --> 00:49:41,733
Without coming to see me?
It was late.

673
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,100
ELLIS:
Men, I want you to hear
this dispatch

674
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:47,367
From the general and chief
of the Army.

675
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:49,400
Colonel Robert Ellis,

676
00:49:49,467 --> 00:49:51,833
Commanding officer
of Fort Duane,

677
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,767
On receipt of this order,

678
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:56,067
You will take proper steps
forthwith

679
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,267
To move all Indians
within your territory

680
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:01,533
To the confines
of reservations

681
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,400
Set aside for this purpose

682
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,967
By the Congress
of the United States.

683
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:10,467
It is suggested that whenever
and wherever possible,

684
00:50:10,533 --> 00:50:13,200
Peaceful means
should be exercised.

685
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:16,000
However,
in the event of refusal

686
00:50:16,067 --> 00:50:18,467
Or difficulty
of any nature,

687
00:50:18,533 --> 00:50:20,867
The commanding officer
will use

688
00:50:20,933 --> 00:50:23,733
Any and all force
at his disposal

689
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,600
For the enforcement
of this order.

690
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:29,300
You may move out,
Captain Vaugant.

691
00:50:29,367 --> 00:50:30,500
Good luck.

692
00:50:30,567 --> 00:50:34,333
(Officer shouts indistinctly)

693
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,233
(Military bugle playing)

694
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,300
Why, Jim?

695
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:41,400
Why are you fighting
against the Indians?

696
00:50:41,467 --> 00:50:43,667
Didn't you once tell me
primitive people

697
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:46,100
Have to give ground
to civilization?

698
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:48,033
(Upbeat theme playing)

699
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:12,867
What is it?

700
00:51:12,933 --> 00:51:14,967
Better hold up a minute
while I scout ahead.

701
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:16,400
How much further?

702
00:51:16,467 --> 00:51:18,833
About two hours riding
and another two on foot.

703
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,467
This is a cavalry outfit,
Mr. Aherne, we ride.

704
00:51:22,533 --> 00:51:26,333
Sure, if you want every gun
in the camp waiting for you.

705
00:51:28,067 --> 00:51:30,067
Aherne knows his business,
Captain.

706
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,900
Just what is his business?

707
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,267
Well, I'd stake my life
on him.

708
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:36,900
That's what you are doing.
All of us are.

709
00:51:36,967 --> 00:51:40,100
You just don't like him.
But I'm stuck with him.

710
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:41,600
And if he does any faking,

711
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:45,300
I'll hang him
from the nearest tree.

712
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:47,433
(Suspenseful theme
playing)

713
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:10,500
Their camp's just over
that ridge.

714
00:52:10,567 --> 00:52:12,267
Have your men
stand by their horses

715
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,600
And keep them quiet.

716
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:17,700
All right, Sergeant.
It's an order.

717
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,567
There it is.

718
00:52:56,133 --> 00:52:57,533
Now, if you'll give me
half your men,

719
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,200
I'll go round to the rear
and cut them off.

720
00:52:59,267 --> 00:53:00,667
You can rest your mind.

721
00:53:00,733 --> 00:53:03,867
Whatever strategy is necessary
will come from me.

722
00:53:03,933 --> 00:53:06,100
Unfortunately,
the Army is too civilized

723
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:07,633
To attack from ambush.

724
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,400
Personally, I'd like nothing
better than to open fire

725
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:15,233
And start shrinking the mighty
Sioux nation down to size.

726
00:53:22,067 --> 00:53:23,433
Mr. Stanley,
check your sights.

727
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,767
Yes, sir.

728
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:27,267
Aherne, take a white flag
and ride into their camp.

729
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:29,100
Inform the chief
of the order from Washington.

730
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:31,667
Tell him he's got two minutes
to surrender before I attack.

731
00:53:31,733 --> 00:53:35,167
Captain, you've overlooked
one thing.

732
00:53:35,233 --> 00:53:38,367
I don't plan
to get myself killed.

733
00:53:38,433 --> 00:53:39,867
You refused
to obey the order?

734
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:42,067
It's a stupid order.

735
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,400
Roger, place this man
under arrest.

736
00:53:46,467 --> 00:53:49,133
May I respectfully remind
the captain

737
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,467
That Mr. Aherne is not a member
of the United States Army?

738
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:56,233
He is not compelled
to serve as an emissary.

739
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,833
I stand corrected.

740
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,100
Never mind, Sergeant.

741
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:02,800
They teach the book

742
00:54:02,867 --> 00:54:06,633
Of rules and regulations well
at West Point, don't they?

743
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,867
I imagine you qualify better
as an emissary.

744
00:54:10,933 --> 00:54:13,433
Don't you agree,
Mr. Hathersall?

745
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,700
Is it an order, sir?

746
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,467
Yes.

747
00:54:19,533 --> 00:54:20,833
Yes.
Let's make it an order.

748
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,633
As soon as they see him,
they'll kill him.

749
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,500
Sounds logical.

750
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:28,333
Sergeant, get a white flag
for the lieutenant.

751
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,100
Sir, may I have
the captain's permission

752
00:54:34,167 --> 00:54:36,100
To go with the lieutenant?

753
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:39,700
You see, Aherne, the Army
is just filled to overflowing

754
00:54:39,767 --> 00:54:42,200
With noble souls.

755
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,500
Yes, Sergeant,
I think we can spare you.

756
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:49,600
Get another flag
for yourself.

757
00:54:50,967 --> 00:54:53,333
Don't be a fool.

758
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,633
He's in command.
He's not fit to command.

759
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,567
He knows they won't give you
a chance to speak.

760
00:54:57,633 --> 00:55:00,067
As soon as they attack,
he'll open fire.

761
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:03,733
Isn't it true these Indians
understand some French, Aherne?

762
00:55:07,267 --> 00:55:08,800
I hope West Point
didn't neglect

763
00:55:08,867 --> 00:55:11,467
Teaching you that language,
Mr. Hathersall.

764
00:55:11,533 --> 00:55:12,933
Hurry it up, Sergeant.

765
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:14,300
Using him for live bait,

766
00:55:14,367 --> 00:55:15,667
He knows they haven't got
a prayer.

767
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:17,933
Yeah, and that Norris
has a wife and two kids.

768
00:55:18,067 --> 00:55:19,267
When the shooting starts,

769
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:22,067
Vaugant better not
turn his back my way.

770
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,533
Not you.

771
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,067
Sergeant Norris and I
look out for each other.

772
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:46,400
(Horses neighing and
Crows shouting indistinctly)

773
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:48,600
VAUGANT:
Who fired that shot?

774
00:55:48,667 --> 00:55:50,433
I don't know, sir.
I didn't see a thing, sir.

775
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,900
It seemed to come
from over there.

776
00:55:51,967 --> 00:55:54,567
I was looking the other way.
Sure scared me, though.

777
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,167
(Crows shouting
indistinctly)

778
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:02,900
Lieutenant Stanley,
commence firing.

779
00:56:02,967 --> 00:56:04,333
I want that village leveled.

780
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,533
Battery. Fire!

781
00:56:21,267 --> 00:56:23,400
How do you like that,
Mr. Aherne?

782
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:26,133
Destroying the village
won't help.

783
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,367
That's just a temporary
war camp.

784
00:56:29,433 --> 00:56:31,233
They'll only fall back
in the woods

785
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,300
And wait for you.

786
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:35,167
Typical Crow trick.

787
00:56:35,233 --> 00:56:39,467
Crows?
That isn't a Sioux camp?

788
00:56:40,633 --> 00:56:42,433
Were you looking for Sioux?

789
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,767
I thought just Indians.
Any kind of Indians.

790
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:49,333
Martin.

791
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,867
Keep Mr. Aherne company.

792
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:54,967
I want him here
when I get back.

793
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:57,200
I'll be here.

794
00:56:59,733 --> 00:57:02,067
Ceasefire!

795
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,433
Mr. Hathersall.
Yes, sir.

796
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,167
Take your men around
to the south side.

797
00:57:05,233 --> 00:57:06,567
I'll work in from the north.

798
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:09,133
We flush them out into range
for Stanley to get.

799
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,567
Yes, sir.

800
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:17,800
Mount the troops.
Take over, Mr. Stanley.

801
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:20,067
Be ready to fire when I drive
them out of those woods.

802
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:21,467
Yes, sir.

803
00:57:21,533 --> 00:57:23,600
(Stanley shouting orders
indistinctly)

804
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:29,967
Forward! Ho!

805
00:57:30,067 --> 00:57:32,100
(Military bugle playing)

806
00:57:51,433 --> 00:57:53,800
Where do you wanna be
kept company?

807
00:57:55,467 --> 00:57:57,433
Hey,
don't you ever smile?

808
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,767
You ain't mad all the time,
are you?

809
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,367
You did a lot of smiling
the night

810
00:58:04,433 --> 00:58:05,900
You and Miss Hathersall
were dancing.

811
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:08,567
Aw, don't let Vaugant
worry you, Aherne.

812
00:58:08,633 --> 00:58:10,367
He doesn't.

813
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:13,733
Every one of those men
will be picked off, one by one.

814
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,333
You can't flush those Crows
out of the woods with rifles.

815
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:21,067
You'd have
to blast them out.

816
00:58:21,133 --> 00:58:23,467
Sounds like a good way
to me.

817
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:27,067
Captain didn't say
we couldn't keep company

818
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,367
On that ammunition wagon.

819
00:58:29,433 --> 00:58:31,233
You see, you can crack
that face of yours

820
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,667
When you want to.
Come on.

821
00:58:37,767 --> 00:58:40,800
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

822
00:58:42,133 --> 00:58:43,833
What are you doing,
Corporal?

823
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,100
Captain wants the wagon.

824
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:48,067
JAMES:
Come on. Come on, come on. Hey!

825
00:59:15,933 --> 00:59:17,667
(Horse snorts)

826
00:59:20,467 --> 00:59:22,533
(Shouting indistinctly)

827
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:29,267
(Horse neighing)

828
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,400
(Gunshots continue)

829
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,600
(Screams)

830
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,700
Fight on foot.

831
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,900
SOLDIER:
Lieutenant. Lieutenant.

832
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,833
Aherne sent me.
Says don't go into those woods.

833
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,833
It's an ambush. He says
for you to try to keep them

834
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,267
Pinned down in there. He
and Martin will flush them out.

835
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:14,333
All right. Cover those thickets
and fire at will!

836
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,367
(Gunshots continue)

837
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:35,867
We're getting short
of ammunition, sir.

838
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:37,233
Conserve.

839
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,733
Where the devil
is Hathersall?

840
01:00:42,567 --> 01:00:44,767
Give me the rope.
Them that live through this

841
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:47,333
We'll be coming out
of the woods real quick.

842
01:01:03,267 --> 01:01:04,667
Let 'er rip!

843
01:01:19,533 --> 01:01:21,600
(Shouting indistinctly)

844
01:01:32,633 --> 01:01:34,767
(Military bugle playing)

845
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,567
The captain's got it
in the shoulder.

846
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:06,833
Tanner. Get that sawbones
down here on the double!

847
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:11,067
That's not too bad, Captain.

848
01:02:11,067 --> 01:02:13,667
You can thank Aherne
if there's any of us left.

849
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:16,267
Go ahead, Aherne.

850
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:18,600
Why don't you gloat?

851
01:02:18,667 --> 01:02:21,567
Now you can be
a great big hero.

852
01:02:21,633 --> 01:02:24,733
A man who feels hatred, Vaugant,
isn't looking for glory.

853
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:25,733
(Gun cocks)

854
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,300
Well, a man like me
can hate enough

855
01:02:28,367 --> 01:02:30,533
To wanna see you dead.

856
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:37,800
(Dramatic theme playing)

857
01:02:47,367 --> 01:02:48,833
Liable to hang me
for this.

858
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,600
(Gunshot)

859
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,367
If I live that long.

860
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,367
Your fella's mighty interested
in those smoke signals

861
01:03:14,433 --> 01:03:15,567
Over that mountain peak.

862
01:03:15,633 --> 01:03:18,100
SOLDIER 1:
Company, halt!

863
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:20,133
SOLDIER 2:
Company, halt!

864
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,333
Those are Crow signals.

865
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,067
(Speaking in French)

866
01:03:26,133 --> 01:03:27,600
Huh?

867
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,833
My French isn't so good.

868
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:35,633
They're just signaling news
of the battle.

869
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:39,267
Telling those who escaped
to return home.

870
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:41,867
See if you can get any more
out of there, huh?

871
01:03:41,933 --> 01:03:43,900
Company! Forward!

872
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:46,167
SOLDIER:
Forward!

873
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:49,533
I have not told
the white leader

874
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,867
I understand French.

875
01:03:50,933 --> 01:03:53,500
I haven't said
I understand the word Crow

876
01:03:53,567 --> 01:03:54,800
When spoken in English.

877
01:03:54,867 --> 01:03:56,500
You do well not to tell.

878
01:03:56,567 --> 01:03:58,833
You do well
to still be alive.

879
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,633
I have not spoken.

880
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,867
But my mind asks
an answer.

881
01:04:02,933 --> 01:04:06,667
It asks why you fight
by the side of soldiers.

882
01:04:06,733 --> 01:04:08,067
And now from the hills,

883
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,667
Signals call you
to meeting with the Sioux.

884
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:12,600
A knife
will find your throat,

885
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:14,200
Before you can ask
this question

886
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,633
Of the white leader.

887
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,333
I have not asked.

888
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,733
But now I ask.

889
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,100
How will you repay
for my silence?

890
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:24,100
Will I and my people be given
our freedom and our lives?

891
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:26,300
Will you and your people
return to your homes

892
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,200
And never come back
to the land of the Sioux?

893
01:04:29,267 --> 01:04:30,267
I agree.

894
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:33,267
In the late darkness,
I will release you.

895
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:35,067
Find out anything?

896
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:36,933
No. Take him up
with the others.

897
01:04:37,067 --> 01:04:39,733
Come on. Come on.

898
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,167
(Suspenseful theme
playing)

899
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:47,833
The knife.

900
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,500
You do not permit us
this one weapon?

901
01:05:50,567 --> 01:05:52,067
It is a long march south.

902
01:05:52,067 --> 01:05:55,300
Weapons will not help Crows
in the land of the Sioux.

903
01:05:55,367 --> 01:05:57,067
The knife.

904
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,900
Perhaps we'll meet again.

905
01:05:58,967 --> 01:06:01,067
I am War Bonnet,
son of Yellow Eagle,

906
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:02,867
Who will not have
to remember too long

907
01:06:02,933 --> 01:06:05,467
That he was forced
to let a Crow live.

908
01:06:05,533 --> 01:06:07,733
(Suspenseful theme
playing)

909
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,700
(James cooing)

910
01:06:32,467 --> 01:06:34,600
(James continues cooing)

911
01:06:56,867 --> 01:06:58,667
You have done well,
my son.

912
01:06:58,733 --> 01:07:00,067
You know about the battle?

913
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,533
Our scouts watched.

914
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:06,067
Good to hear that the thieving
Crows were destroyed.

915
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:10,600
The soldiers suffered
many losses.

916
01:07:10,667 --> 01:07:12,700
Not as many
as they will tomorrow.

917
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:15,233
Not one will escape
our ambush.

918
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,067
I know it's not easy,
my son.

919
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:20,133
You're fresh from fighting
side by side

920
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,400
With these soldiers.

921
01:07:21,467 --> 01:07:23,600
Tomorrow you must turn
your weapons against them.

922
01:07:23,667 --> 01:07:24,800
They have big guns.

923
01:07:24,867 --> 01:07:26,333
They were not harmed
in the battle.

924
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,700
No?
After we take them,

925
01:07:28,767 --> 01:07:31,067
You will show our braves
how to make them shoot.

926
01:07:31,133 --> 01:07:33,567
We will easily take the fort
with those big guns.

927
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:35,800
There will be scalps enough
for all.

928
01:07:35,867 --> 01:07:37,767
Our plan is good.

929
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:40,267
We've talked it through
in council.

930
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:43,833
While White Thunder's Oglalas
attack beyond the great river,

931
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,467
We will march
against Fort Duane.

932
01:07:45,533 --> 01:07:48,367
No one must escape
to carry word of our victories

933
01:07:48,433 --> 01:07:49,567
To the other forts.

934
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:51,100
The women and children
will be taken prisoners.

935
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,733
We take no prisoners.
We are not Crows.

936
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,233
We do not kill
women and children.

937
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,833
Was not Luta a woman?

938
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,233
We cannot take prisoners.

939
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:02,500
We do not stop with Fort Duane.
We move on to new battles.

940
01:08:02,567 --> 01:08:04,200
To the forts in the south.

941
01:08:04,267 --> 01:08:05,900
That is your order?

942
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:08,667
To kill women and children?

943
01:08:08,733 --> 01:08:10,567
Since the day
when you spoke words

944
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:12,833
Over the grave
of your father,

945
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,800
Since that day when I took you
for my son,

946
01:08:15,867 --> 01:08:18,667
I've understood
the hate you bear the Crows.

947
01:08:18,733 --> 01:08:22,467
I've understood it,
and I've shared it

948
01:08:22,533 --> 01:08:25,967
In my heart and my lance.

949
01:08:26,067 --> 01:08:27,933
Now I ask you
to understand.

950
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:30,400
I ask you to share
the hate I bear those

951
01:08:30,467 --> 01:08:32,867
Who've killed my child.

952
01:08:39,967 --> 01:08:41,333
It will be as you ask.

953
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:49,067
It is a long way back
to the soldier's camp.

954
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:53,467
We better talk quickly of where
and when you will attack.

955
01:08:53,533 --> 01:08:55,633
In Moon Pass.

956
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,233
A half day's journey
from here.

957
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,567
We'll wait until you lead
the enemy well inside the pass

958
01:09:01,633 --> 01:09:03,667
Before we attack.

959
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:12,300
Oh, Lieutenant.
They must have gone that way.

960
01:09:12,367 --> 01:09:14,700
Found this down below
on the rocks.

961
01:09:14,767 --> 01:09:16,233
OFFICER:
Call in the rest of the men.

962
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,267
SOLDIER 1: Yes, sir.
SOLDIER 2: They all got away.

963
01:09:18,333 --> 01:09:20,300
SOLDIER 3:
Yeah, they cut themselves loose.

964
01:09:20,367 --> 01:09:24,200
The lieutenant found
the pieces of rope.

965
01:09:24,267 --> 01:09:26,267
Mr. Aherne,
Lieutenant wants you.

966
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:29,133
The prisoners escaped,
every last one of them.

967
01:09:33,067 --> 01:09:34,267
Oh, Jim.

968
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,333
You didn't do a very good job
of searching them.

969
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,900
They got a knife or two.

970
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:40,067
Lucky, they didn't take
a few scalps before they left.

971
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:41,567
We can track them down,
Lieutenant.

972
01:09:41,633 --> 01:09:44,400
Aherne and me can find them,
can't we?

973
01:09:44,467 --> 01:09:46,933
I'm afraid they'd be
a long ways off by now.

974
01:09:47,067 --> 01:09:49,900
Forget it. We've gotta get
our wounded back to the fort.

975
01:09:49,967 --> 01:09:51,667
Get the men started
on breakfast, Sergeant.

976
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:53,100
Yes, sir.

977
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:57,500
I got some good coffee
on the fire for us, Aherne.

978
01:09:57,567 --> 01:09:59,833
Looks like you're stuck
with the corporal, Jim.

979
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:02,700
From now on, you'll be
finding him close by.

980
01:10:02,767 --> 01:10:05,633
Old-time soldiers
like Martin have a knack

981
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,333
For picking partners
they can trust.

982
01:10:10,767 --> 01:10:12,433
You know, one thing
I don't wanna miss,

983
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,600
Corporal and Tally
are liable to have trouble

984
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:16,100
Dividing you up.

985
01:10:16,167 --> 01:10:17,900
And Tally
isn't the kind of girl

986
01:10:17,967 --> 01:10:20,767
That'll let you spend much time
with anyone else.

987
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:22,700
SOLDIER:
Lieutenant.

988
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:36,233
SOLDIER:
Ho.

989
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:40,400
Sergeant Cumming, sir,
5th Cavalry, Fort Holland.

990
01:10:40,467 --> 01:10:41,833
What are you doing
this far south?

991
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,833
Sir, I have orders
to escort these civilians

992
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,800
To Fort Duane
for protection.

993
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:50,067
Fort Holland's under attack by
the Sioux Chief White Thunder.

994
01:10:50,133 --> 01:10:51,667
Well...

995
01:10:55,567 --> 01:10:57,867
All right, Sergeant.
Give your folks a stretch.

996
01:10:57,933 --> 01:10:59,667
Anyone's hungry,
breakfast is ready.

997
01:10:59,733 --> 01:11:03,800
Thank you, sir.
Dismount, men.

998
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,300
All right, everybody,
stretch and breakfast.

999
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:12,433
(Indistinct chattering)

1000
01:11:28,733 --> 01:11:30,800
(Upbeat theme playing)

1001
01:12:24,367 --> 01:12:27,800
Mister Scout,
here's some cookies.

1002
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:30,567
Thank you.

1003
01:12:40,867 --> 01:12:43,100
Aren't you coming?

1004
01:12:43,167 --> 01:12:44,300
What have you got there?

1005
01:12:44,367 --> 01:12:46,067
Cookies.
One of the ladies...

1006
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,067
Don't mind if I do.

1007
01:12:49,067 --> 01:12:51,700
Where you from, Aherne?
I mean, originally.

1008
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:52,967
Virginia.

1009
01:12:53,067 --> 01:12:57,267
Well, these are pretty good.
Whereabouts in Virginia?

1010
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:59,233
Near Richmond.

1011
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:03,433
I hear they built that place up
nice and pretty since the war.

1012
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,100
I started soldiering
in that one under Grant.

1013
01:13:06,167 --> 01:13:07,467
You must have been
pretty little

1014
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:09,367
When we rode through your part
of the country.

1015
01:13:09,433 --> 01:13:11,500
Do you remember any of it?
Some.

1016
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:13,767
Shooting, burning.

1017
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:15,133
Burning is right.

1018
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,367
Burned out
a lot of good crops,

1019
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:18,233
Burned out
a lot of nice houses.

1020
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,467
You know,
wars don't make sense.

1021
01:13:19,533 --> 01:13:20,867
You burn, you kill,

1022
01:13:20,933 --> 01:13:23,733
Then come peace, you have
to rebuild what you burn.

1023
01:13:30,067 --> 01:13:31,633
Take it away.

1024
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:41,400
Even this kind of a campaign
don't make good sense.

1025
01:13:41,467 --> 01:13:43,833
You mean the Army's wrong?

1026
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,800
Well, about half and half,
my way of figurin'.

1027
01:13:46,867 --> 01:13:50,167
We ain't got the right to push
these Indians onto reservations.

1028
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:52,733
But they ain't got the right
to claim all this land either.

1029
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:53,800
They gotta move over

1030
01:13:53,867 --> 01:13:55,833
And give the next fellow
a little room.

1031
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:58,600
They won't move over.

1032
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,367
That's the general trouble
with people.

1033
01:14:00,433 --> 01:14:01,700
They won't give elbow room.

1034
01:14:01,767 --> 01:14:03,900
We won't budge,
they won't either.

1035
01:14:03,967 --> 01:14:05,633
So the Army's gotta do
some pushing

1036
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,900
With bullets and bayonets.

1037
01:14:07,967 --> 01:14:10,800
No matter how many forts
the Sioux attack and burn,

1038
01:14:10,867 --> 01:14:12,700
They can't win
an all-out shoving contest.

1039
01:14:12,767 --> 01:14:14,733
They can't do it.
We got the most men.

1040
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,700
The most ammunition,
the most know-how.

1041
01:14:16,767 --> 01:14:18,367
We're bound to win
in the long run.

1042
01:14:18,433 --> 01:14:20,467
Simple arithmetic.

1043
01:14:20,533 --> 01:14:22,433
Yeah, I guess it is.

1044
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,267
Trouble is, though,
a lot of people,

1045
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:26,533
Indians and us too,

1046
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,900
Gonna get themselves
killed.

1047
01:14:30,433 --> 01:14:34,467
Hey, mister,
how much further to the fort?

1048
01:14:34,533 --> 01:14:37,533
We'll be there soon
after sundown, sonny.

1049
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,133
Kids like that
are gonna see things

1050
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,600
They shouldn't have to see.

1051
01:14:43,667 --> 01:14:46,233
Maybe even
get themselves butchered.

(Ominous theme playing)

1053
01:15:06,067 --> 01:15:08,200
(Suspenseful theme
playing)

1054
01:15:17,933 --> 01:15:19,167
There is yet time.

1055
01:15:19,233 --> 01:15:21,533
Even better than I,
you know the wisdom of battle.

1056
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,633
But is this wisdom?
You have braves to spare.

1057
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:27,333
Why do you refuse to place
some along the lower trail?

1058
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,433
You do not speak to me
of wisdom.

1059
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:30,900
You tell me
you do not trust my son.

1060
01:15:30,967 --> 01:15:33,500
But I only ask...
Why do you still question?

1061
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:36,733
Your aging eyes can see farther
than your doubting mind.

1062
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,667
You will see War Bonnet
bringing the enemy to us.

1063
01:15:44,867 --> 01:15:46,933
(Suspenseful theme
playing)

1064
01:16:17,533 --> 01:16:19,100
LONG MANE:
All is well, Yellow Eagle.

1065
01:16:19,167 --> 01:16:21,867
Yes.
And my son brings them.

1066
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:27,667
Prepare to attack.

1067
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:40,900
Now!
Hyah!

1068
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:43,233
(Dramatic theme
playing)

1069
01:17:06,067 --> 01:17:07,400
Attack! Attack!

1070
01:17:07,467 --> 01:17:08,800
(Shouting indistinctly)

1071
01:17:13,167 --> 01:17:15,300
SOLDIER:
Hey, guard, here.

1072
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:21,600
(Sioux Indians shouting
indistinctly)

1073
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:33,300
SOLDIER:
Hey, Aherne's hit.

1074
01:17:33,367 --> 01:17:36,067
WESTON:
Quick, break that arrow.

1075
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,200
Get him on his horse.

1076
01:17:38,267 --> 01:17:39,900
(Sioux Indians shouting
indistinctly)

1077
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:57,400
"Is it the pigment of man's skin
which makes him a Miniconjou,

1078
01:17:57,467 --> 01:17:59,833
"Member of the mighty Sioux?

1079
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:03,467
"No, it is the throbbing inside
which tells him

1080
01:18:03,533 --> 01:18:08,100
How great is the love he has
for his father."

1081
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:12,900
These were the lying words
he spoke at the great council.

1082
01:18:12,967 --> 01:18:15,900
With the lying smoothness
of the white man.

1083
01:18:15,967 --> 01:18:17,967
We attack Fort Duane!

1084
01:18:18,067 --> 01:18:20,100
(Indistinctly shouting)

1085
01:18:21,633 --> 01:18:23,900

1086
01:18:27,967 --> 01:18:29,900
(Horse snorts)

1087
01:19:11,067 --> 01:19:13,400
Hello, sis.
He's in the third wagon.

1088
01:19:13,467 --> 01:19:15,933
Now, don't worry,
it's not a bad wound.

1089
01:19:23,267 --> 01:19:26,067
Frank, get a stretcher.
Yeah.

1090
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,367
He's all right, miss.
He lost some blood.

1091
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:33,400
Once the doc gets that
hunk of arrow out of his arm,

1092
01:19:33,467 --> 01:19:35,733
All he'll need's a lot
of red beef, good strong beef.

1093
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:39,833
Nothing like beef and tea
for growing the blood.

1094
01:19:43,933 --> 01:19:46,933
No reason he won't be up
and around pretty soon.

1095
01:19:47,067 --> 01:19:49,367
You did a nice job
with your tourniquet, Corporal.

1096
01:19:49,433 --> 01:19:52,167
Seems like I've been putting
tourniquets on the soldiers

1097
01:19:52,233 --> 01:19:54,633
All the way from Bull Run
to here.

1098
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,233
More than 20 years of it.

1099
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:59,367
They tell me Aherne saved
the outfit from ambush.

1100
01:19:59,433 --> 01:20:00,633
Yes, sir.

1101
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,433
What is it?
Some sixth sense?

1102
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,967
How could he spot the ambush
a half mile up that pass?

1103
01:20:07,033 --> 01:20:10,300
Well, he's the best
Indian scout I ever ran into.

1104
01:20:22,533 --> 01:20:23,933
Sioux arrowhead, isn't it?

1105
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,400
Yes, sir. Tough people.

1106
01:20:26,467 --> 01:20:28,500
They won't push around
very easy.

1107
01:20:28,567 --> 01:20:30,500
Afraid not.

1108
01:20:35,533 --> 01:20:36,533
When he comes to,

1109
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,667
Tell him Colonel Ellis
wants to talk to him.

1110
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:40,767
Yes, Doctor.

1111
01:20:50,667 --> 01:20:55,767
I'll wait in the other room,
if you need me.

1112
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:57,167
(Door closes)

1113
01:20:57,233 --> 01:20:59,300
(Melancholic theme
playing)

1114
01:21:17,533 --> 01:21:21,567
Jim. Jim.

1115
01:21:21,633 --> 01:21:23,867
You're home, Jim.

1116
01:21:23,933 --> 01:21:25,800
You're home.

1117
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,500
What happened at Moon Pass?

1118
01:21:57,567 --> 01:21:59,400
Well, if it hadn't been
for Aherne,

1119
01:21:59,467 --> 01:22:01,867
Not one of us should be back
here at the fort tonight, miss.

1120
01:22:01,933 --> 01:22:03,867
And that's gospel.

1121
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,933
You think a lot of him,
don't you?

1122
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,067
So do I.

1123
01:22:12,133 --> 01:22:13,633
That's why
because you like him,

1124
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:17,467
You're trying to talk around
what you're thinking.

1125
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:19,367
I'll have to ask him.

1126
01:22:21,067 --> 01:22:24,133
I've got to know how he knew
that ambush was there.

1127
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,733
No matter what happened
or how it happened,

1128
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,433
He led you out of it.

1129
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,867
I've got to know.

1130
01:22:30,933 --> 01:22:34,167
Were them Sioux waiting there
by appointment?

1131
01:22:34,233 --> 01:22:37,300
Are you going to say anything
to Colonel Ellis?

1132
01:22:40,567 --> 01:22:43,067
There's over 20 years
of army training,

1133
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:46,467
Army thinking,
and loyalty behind me, miss.

1134
01:22:46,533 --> 01:22:50,800
You don't boot a mess of years
like that out the window.

1135
01:22:50,867 --> 01:22:52,467
You just don't.

1136
01:23:03,967 --> 01:23:06,867
At least
you'll talk to Jim first.

1137
01:23:11,067 --> 01:23:12,800
Won't you?

1138
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,500
Yeah.

1139
01:23:17,567 --> 01:23:19,300
I won't put the smell
of renegade on him

1140
01:23:19,367 --> 01:23:20,600
Without being sure.

1141
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:22,967
Or without telling him
that's what I was gonna do.

1142
01:23:23,067 --> 01:23:24,400
(Military bugle playing)

1143
01:23:24,467 --> 01:23:29,067
MAN:
What now? Come on, snap it up.
Come on.

1144
01:23:29,133 --> 01:23:31,133
(Men indistinctly
shouting)

1145
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,267
SERGEANT: Hurry up, now!
What's happening, Sergeant?

1146
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:38,267
The Sioux are out there, ma'am.
You better keep inside.

1147
01:23:38,333 --> 01:23:40,333
SERGEANT: Come on. Snap it up!
Excuse me, miss.

1148
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,067
SERGEANT:
You're always the last one.

1149
01:23:42,067 --> 01:23:44,300
I want the area outside
well lighted.

1150
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:46,067
Just in case they forget
their superstition

1151
01:23:46,133 --> 01:23:47,700
And make a night attack.
Yes, sir.

1152
01:23:47,767 --> 01:23:50,067
Stanley, keep the Howitzers in
the center of the parade ground,

1153
01:23:50,133 --> 01:23:51,900
So they'll be in easy position
to maneuver.

1154
01:23:51,967 --> 01:23:53,833
Yes, sir.

1155
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,467
Please dim your lights,
Miss Hathersall.

1156
01:23:55,533 --> 01:23:57,733
Only one light permitted.
Certainly.

1157
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,967
SERGEANT:
On the double!

1158
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:01,167
(Indistinct shouting)

1159
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,200
(Men indistinctly
speaking)

1160
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,500
SERGEANT:
Come on! Pull it!

1161
01:24:25,733 --> 01:24:27,133
Ho, he comes.

1162
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,367
The friend of our enemy
comes.

1163
01:24:37,467 --> 01:24:39,333
(Indistinct shouting)

1164
01:24:42,067 --> 01:24:44,067
SIOUX INDIAN:
Kill him! Throw him!

1165
01:24:44,067 --> 01:24:46,133
(Indistinct shouting
continues)

1166
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:08,100
Give the white man a lance.

1167
01:25:08,167 --> 01:25:10,600
What is to be done,
I will do.

1168
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:12,300
I ask a moment to be heard.

1169
01:25:12,367 --> 01:25:13,700
Hear me.

1170
01:25:13,767 --> 01:25:15,233
To all my people.

1171
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:19,067
I confess my shame for having
warmed you at my fire.

1172
01:25:19,067 --> 01:25:23,067
I do not ask for sympathy
or a pardon for myself.

1173
01:25:23,067 --> 01:25:25,967
I am here to stop you
from destroying yourselves.

1174
01:25:26,067 --> 01:25:28,467
I call you traitor.
I call you coward.

1175
01:25:28,533 --> 01:25:29,700
Listen to me.

1176
01:25:29,767 --> 01:25:31,400
Inside that fort
are big guns.

1177
01:25:31,467 --> 01:25:33,900
Their cannon will kill most of
you before you reach the wall.

1178
01:25:33,967 --> 01:25:35,100
Because of the traitor,

1179
01:25:35,167 --> 01:25:36,767
The big guns
are pointed this way.

1180
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:39,533
You're right, I did this.

1181
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,133
Today, I could not destroy
the soldiers,

1182
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,233
The women and children
in the wagons.

1183
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,967
Now, I cannot let you or you,

1184
01:25:49,067 --> 01:25:50,700
You, Long Mane,

1185
01:25:50,767 --> 01:25:52,600
You, my mother,

1186
01:25:52,667 --> 01:25:55,633
My father, I cannot let you
destroy yourselves.

1187
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:57,067
The white man can forget

1188
01:25:57,133 --> 01:25:59,300
How his white brothers
killed my child.

1189
01:25:59,367 --> 01:26:00,867
No, I do not forget.

1190
01:26:00,933 --> 01:26:03,600
I will never forget.

1191
01:26:03,667 --> 01:26:05,800
But I have learned much.

1192
01:26:05,867 --> 01:26:09,933
My heart no longer
quickly grows hot with anger.

1193
01:26:10,067 --> 01:26:12,500
My head tells me
to wait, think,

1194
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:14,667
And remember these things
I have learned.

1195
01:26:14,733 --> 01:26:16,567
From your white brothers?

1196
01:26:16,633 --> 01:26:18,933
Yes.

1197
01:26:19,067 --> 01:26:22,367
My sister, Luta,
was killed by white men.

1198
01:26:22,433 --> 01:26:24,100
But all whites
are not killers.

1199
01:26:24,167 --> 01:26:26,533
I have lived among them.
I fought at their sides.

1200
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,367
I know this is true.

1201
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,867
Running Dog killed
and lied and stole.

1202
01:26:30,933 --> 01:26:36,067
Are all Sioux killers, liars,
thieves? It cannot be so.

1203
01:26:36,133 --> 01:26:39,300
These are things I have learned
and I believe.

1204
01:26:39,367 --> 01:26:42,300
Even that there are good
and evil among Crows.

1205
01:26:42,367 --> 01:26:45,533
How long must we listen to
the lying words of a traitor?

1206
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,333
MAN:
Let the white man take his turn
with the lance.

1207
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,633
ALL:
Yeah.

1208
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,633
If the duel
is not to the liking

1209
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:53,900
Of the chief
of the Miniconjou,

1210
01:26:53,967 --> 01:26:55,300
Let another take his place.

1211
01:26:55,367 --> 01:26:57,500
ALL:
I will.

1212
01:27:01,567 --> 01:27:04,133
It is for me to do.

1213
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:08,100
I say this final thing.

1214
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,067
No matter
how many fort you burn,

1215
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,867
No matter
how many scalps you take,

1216
01:27:12,933 --> 01:27:15,700
The end of the war
is plain to see.

1217
01:27:15,767 --> 01:27:17,300
More soldiers will come.

1218
01:27:17,367 --> 01:27:20,933
More guns, as many as there
are stars in the heavens.

1219
01:27:21,067 --> 01:27:24,200
For every soldier you kill,
ten will come.

1220
01:27:24,267 --> 01:27:26,800
And they too will kill.

1221
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:30,567
We Miniconjou do not have
ten for one.

1222
01:27:30,633 --> 01:27:36,567
The once proud name Miniconjou
will become a forgotten name,

1223
01:27:36,633 --> 01:27:39,700
Because its people
were too proud to sit down

1224
01:27:39,767 --> 01:27:41,300
And counsel
with the soldiers.

1225
01:27:41,367 --> 01:27:45,967
The white man has spoken.
Now let him fight.

1226
01:27:46,067 --> 01:27:47,400
(Indistinct chattering)

1227
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:16,067
I refuse my turn
with the lance.

1228
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:26,833
Remember, Yellow Eagle,
you have said it many times.

1229
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:31,200
He who has lived without honor
must die without honor.

1230
01:28:31,267 --> 01:28:33,200
It is the law of our people.

1231
01:28:49,267 --> 01:28:50,533
(Ominous theme playing)

1232
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:05,267
The law of the Miniconjou
has been carried out.

1233
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,733
The white man
still lives.

1234
01:29:16,367 --> 01:29:20,300
I say it is the wish
of the Great Spirit

1235
01:29:20,367 --> 01:29:22,400
That he live.

1236
01:29:22,467 --> 01:29:24,333
He will live.

1237
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,700
Hear me, Iron Breast.

1238
01:29:26,767 --> 01:29:30,067
I am chief
of the Miniconjou.

1239
01:29:30,067 --> 01:29:33,467
I say I have taken my turn
with the lance

1240
01:29:33,533 --> 01:29:36,600
And carried out the law
of our tribe.

1241
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:42,367
Now I say
return to your fires.

1242
01:29:42,433 --> 01:29:44,500
(Melancholic theme
playing)

1243
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:05,833
Why did he force me
to do this?

1244
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,233
Why did he return?

1245
01:30:09,367 --> 01:30:12,067
Has he not told you why
so many times?

1246
01:30:12,133 --> 01:30:14,500
Has he not told you
the love he feels in his heart

1247
01:30:14,567 --> 01:30:16,967
For you, his father?

1248
01:30:17,033 --> 01:30:19,900
Has he not shown you
this love all these years?

1249
01:30:19,967 --> 01:30:22,733
I had to do this.

1250
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,300
If I had not,
it would long be said

1251
01:30:26,367 --> 01:30:27,500
There are laws for all,

1252
01:30:27,567 --> 01:30:30,733
Except the chief
of the Miniconjou.

1253
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,433
You know this is so,
Pehangi.

1254
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,633
I only know he is my son,

1255
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:38,867
That he came to speak truth
and wisdom to protect us,

1256
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:41,033
And that his father
spilled his blood.

1257
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:44,433
I did not throw the lance
to kill. He will live.

1258
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:48,500
I pray he will live.

1259
01:30:51,833 --> 01:30:53,900
(Dramatic theme playing)

1260
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,767
A whole flock of Indians
out there, sir.

1261
01:30:59,833 --> 01:31:02,500
SOLDIER:
Some of them coming this way.

1262
01:31:14,967 --> 01:31:17,500
There's a woman on one
of those horses, Colonel.

1263
01:31:23,433 --> 01:31:26,133
Hold all fire.

1264
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,467
Hold your fire.

1265
01:31:28,533 --> 01:31:30,733
SOLDIER:
Hold your fire.

1266
01:31:34,333 --> 01:31:36,833
There's somebody
in that travois.

1267
01:31:39,433 --> 01:31:40,933
I think
it's Aherne, sir.

1268
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:46,267
TALLY: May I look, please?
SOLDIER: Sure, ma'am.

1269
01:31:51,767 --> 01:31:54,600
It is.

1270
01:31:54,667 --> 01:31:56,400
Get a detail
ready to ride out.

1271
01:31:56,467 --> 01:31:58,167
Tell them to be careful.
This may be a trick.

1272
01:31:58,233 --> 01:31:59,867
Yes, sir.

1273
01:32:00,067 --> 01:32:01,167
WESTON:
Corporal Martin.

1274
01:32:01,233 --> 01:32:03,067
Corporal Martin.
MARTIN: Yes!

1275
01:32:03,133 --> 01:32:05,233
Get a detail ready to ride out.
Yes, sir.

1276
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:06,500
Freed, Will.

1277
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,367
We part now.

1278
01:32:27,433 --> 01:32:28,933
Remember that we, Sioux,

1279
01:32:29,067 --> 01:32:32,500
Are but a small number
in this great river of whites.

1280
01:32:32,567 --> 01:32:36,467
Make a place for yourself
and for us among the white men.

1281
01:32:36,533 --> 01:32:37,933
This is the only way

1282
01:32:38,067 --> 01:32:40,500
We will not be swallowed up
in this great river.

1283
01:32:40,567 --> 01:32:42,500
It will be done.

1284
01:32:42,567 --> 01:32:45,833
There are men of understanding
among the soldiers.

1285
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:49,300
They will help me return
so that I can serve my people.

1286
01:32:49,367 --> 01:32:51,933
I want to believe this.

1287
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:54,433
Oh, husband of little faith.

1288
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:58,400
If you love him,
you must not doubt him.

1289
01:32:58,467 --> 01:33:01,367
I know sometimes
there is a great separation

1290
01:33:01,433 --> 01:33:03,600
Between father and son.

1291
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:08,700
Like the empty space
between two mountaintops.

1292
01:33:08,767 --> 01:33:12,300
But I also know
there is love between us.

1293
01:33:12,367 --> 01:33:14,367
While this love lives,

1294
01:33:14,433 --> 01:33:17,267
The empty space grows
very small.

1295
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:19,367
Even the silence
in these moons

1296
01:33:19,433 --> 01:33:22,233
I will be away,
it will not count.

1297
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:23,767
We will have this love.

1298
01:33:23,833 --> 01:33:26,967
Grow well, my son.

1299
01:33:27,067 --> 01:33:28,700
Grow well.

1300
01:33:29,867 --> 01:33:34,467
And you my parents,
keep well.

1301
01:33:34,533 --> 01:33:36,467
I will return.

1302
01:33:54,233 --> 01:33:56,300
(Dramatic theme playing)

1303
01:34:05,667 --> 01:34:09,200
Are you all right, Aherne?
I'm all right.

1304
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:21,733
Hey, don't tell me
them Sioux are running away.

1305
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,267
No, they're not
running away.

1306
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:25,067
Just moving over
to give the other fellow

1307
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:26,933
A little elbow room.

1308
01:34:30,067 --> 01:34:32,367
All right, Holmes,
let's go nice and easy.

1309
01:34:32,433 --> 01:34:34,500
(Upbeat theme playing)
