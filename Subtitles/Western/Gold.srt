1
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,210
Emily Meyer, I presume.

2
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,641
Wilhelm Laser.
I'm the leader of the group.

3
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,808
We've been expecting you. Come along.

4
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,921
I have the honour
to present Emily Meyer to you.

5
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,645
What a sight for sore eyes.

6
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,006
Gustav Muller.

7
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,409
I hung the flag from the wagon
so you'd find us easily.

8
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,485
This is Joseph Rossmann.

9
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,081
It's a pleasure.

10
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,408
These are Maria and Otto Dietz.

11
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,931
Our cooks.

12
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,767
The man with the horses is our packer.

13
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,851
Let's put the formalities behind us.

14
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,166
And now, please, your payment
into our gold prospecting concern...

15
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,049
for the purchase
of land plots in Dawson, as agreed.

16
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,131
We are here.

17
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,961
Our path leads us
about 1500 kilometres to the north.

18
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,440
Via Quesnel,

19
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,405
Hazelton,

20
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,081
Telegraph Creek.

21
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,285
From Telegraph Creek
it's not far to Teslin Lake.

22
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,331
There we will switch to boats,

23
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,887
and travel downstream along the Yukon.

24
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,526
From there it's child's play to Dawson

25
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,649
and the goldfields of the Klondike.

26
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,283
Now that we're all present

27
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,202
I can only congratulate
all members of our group

28
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,200
on having answered
my newspaper announcement.

29
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,007
You were right to choose
the inland route through Canada.

30
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,566
Enough horror stories have been told
about the other routes to the Klondike.

31
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,970
They are considerably more expensive
and most arduous.

32
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,401
We, however,
will have a pleasant trip.

33
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,168
I assume that in six weeks

34
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,251
we will arrive
at our destination of Dawson.

35
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,409
Well, ladies and gentlemen...

36
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,843
this is that which awaits you.

37
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,725
Give me your horse.

38
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,968
<i>I'll</i> look after it.
- All right.

39
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,086
Go ahead.

40
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,088
Are you a child of the city, too?

41
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,730
May I ask where from?

42
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,165
Chicago.

43
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,645
I am originally from Bremen.

44
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,170
I come from Hanover.

45
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,125
But I've lived in America
since my childhood.

46
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,410
I work for a German newspaper
in New York.

47
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,162
We Germans
have to stick together abroad.

48
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,288
I'm reporting on our trip.

49
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,051
It is worth
keeping a record of for posterity.

50
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,691
What do you make of her?

51
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,165
Of whom?
- "Of whom?" Her, of course!

52
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,968
Well?
- Well what?

53
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,761
I asked you what you make of her.

54
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,802
A single woman joining
a group of gold-prospecting strangers!

55
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,368
Gold attracts all kinds of people.

56
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,450
Yes, but don't forget
she's surrounded by men.

57
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,689
It'll upset the group.

58
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,081
Let's drink to a successful voyage.

59
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,285
Muller, we'd agreed on
a bare minimum of provisions.

60
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,122
There's no need for pettiness, Laser.

61
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,561
No one could object to a good beer.

62
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,203
And the sooner we've drunk it,
the lighter my load will be.

63
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,805
Here's to the gold

64
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,126
that's waiting for us.

65
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:28,681
<i>Fare ye well,
beloved homeland mine</i>

66
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,565
<i>Oh homeland mine, farewell!</i>

67
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:42,410
<i>I take leave right now
for foreign climes</i>

68
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,841
<i>Oh homeland mine, farewell!</i>

69
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,450
We should stop.
The horses need to rest.

70
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,684
We're coming along well.
We should stick with it.

71
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,481
We won't get far on exhausted nags.

72
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,769
I hired you as a packer, Boehmer.
<i>I'll</i> let you know if I need your advice.

73
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,280
Have a look at that.
Didn't I tell you?

74
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,851
Here.

75
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,291
Thanks.

76
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,009
You should take a break, too.

77
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,446
Later.

78
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,929
Do you need help with the horses?

79
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,930
<i>I'll</i> handle it myself.
It's what I'm paid for.

80
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,840
I understand.
I didn't mean to intrude.

81
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,889
May I take a photograph of you?

82
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,400
Save your film for better shots.

83
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,400
Photographing someone like you
could never be a waste.

84
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,324
You're only travelling
so as to report on the journey?

85
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,490
You're not interested in gold at all?
- Of course I am.

86
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:04,050
I can certainly imagine another life
beyond that of a poorly paid scribe.

87
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,646
My wife and I have four children.

88
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,046
We live in a hovel in New York.

89
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,289
We have one single <i>room.</i>

90
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,050
It is damp and so dark
that a light burns in it all day long.

91
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,768
The children are always ill.

92
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,681
I have to offer my family a better life.

93
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,641
I didn't mean to be impolite last time.

94
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,930
I didn't introduce myself even.

95
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,481
Carl Boehmer.
- Emily Meyer.

96
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,770
Does your offer still stand?

97
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,805
What?
- Your offer, does it still stand?

98
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,850
Which offer?

99
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,048
Of helping me with the horses.

100
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,282
I thought you can manage on your own.

101
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,244
It's what you're paid for.

102
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,851
Well?

103
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,529
You can take a blanket
and rub down the horses.

104
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,488
Only leave that horse be.

105
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,680
He doesn't like strangers touching him.

106
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,762
I expect he's yours.
- Yes.

107
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,642
We'll have to leave the wagon here.

108
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,770
I'm a carpenter.

109
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,483
I can try to fix the wheel.

110
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,250
There's no point.
The wagon is just holding us up.

111
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,006
Are you mad?

112
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,722
How can we transport
our cooking utensils without it?

113
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,489
You said, Laser, we'd be travelling
on well-kept roads.

114
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,805
Is there a problem?

115
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,645
Everything is well.

116
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,883
Why don't we ride on, then?

117
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,447
Mind your own business, Rossmann.

118
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,689
The river is not on the map.

119
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,809
I thought you knew the area.

120
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,530
And indeed I do.

121
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,841
Boehmer!

122
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,129
What are we eating here?

123
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,881
Pulverised potatoes,
crystallised eggs, dried onions.

124
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,048
This new-fangled stuff is inedible.

125
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,283
You'll have to get used to it.

126
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,045
We've a long trip ahead

127
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,724
and need food that keeps.

128
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,360
Where do you live
when you're not travelling?

129
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,884
Where work can be found.

130
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,885
And you?

131
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,121
For the last five years, in Chicago.

132
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,129
I worked there as a maidservant.

133
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,364
A maidservant?

134
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,964
That seems unlike you.

135
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,561
How's that?
- It just does.

136
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,122
It wasn't exactly my dream.

137
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,643
In Bremen there were offices
hiring maidservants for America.

138
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,481
They hired me
for a German family in Chicago.

139
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,683
I was with them for four years
at one dollar a day.

140
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,411
Then I married.

141
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,164
That's about all there is to me.

142
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,048
And where is your husband now?

143
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,491
We're divorced.

144
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,688
Oh, I'm sorry.
- You needn't be.

145
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,684
It wasn't a good time.

146
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,890
Muller, get up at last!

147
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,930
We're heading on.

148
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,445
We'll wait here.

149
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,128
Have you ever been around here?

150
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,681
This is my first time so far north.

151
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,965
Laser's too, it seems...

152
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,009
Where are these damn savages leading us?

153
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,642
We take the route to the interior.

154
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,201
It'd be wiser
to heed the Indians' advice.

155
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,047
They know the terrain best.
- We take the other route.

156
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,761
Indians only know their own terrain.

157
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,284
And we've no time for diversions.
- Laser's right.

158
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,962
We shouldn't trust the Indians.
They only want our money.

159
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,368
I bet there are more round the corner
just holding out their hands.

160
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,882
The collarbone is probably broken.

161
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,805
I have to take care of the food.

162
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,208
No, you needn't.
<i>I'll</i> do it myself.

163
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,085
Rest up.

164
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,925
We'll only ride <i>on</i> tomorrow.

165
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,886
I must confess I thought this journey
would be rather easier.

166
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,246
It's good to unhitch for a while,
isn't it?

167
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,605
Yes.

168
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,206
Allow me to give you
a piece of personal advice.

169
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,122
I couldn't help but notice
that our packer is making up to you.

170
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,010
Perhaps you misunderstand me,

171
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,089
but you should be wary of him.

172
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,484
There's something wrong about him.

173
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,964
He's no company for you.

174
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,407
We travel all day as a group.

175
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,648
I would like to be alone for a while.

176
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,086
Of course.

177
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,085
We all need peace.

178
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,289
Are you going to plunk away all day,
or will you come hunting?

179
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,447
I can't stand our cooks' grub anymore.

180
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,243
What are you doing, Muller?

181
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,685
We were wondering where you were.
- I'm examining the river.

182
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,768
I thought we might find gold,
you never know.

183
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,524
You're out of luck here.

184
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,809
What makes you so certain?

185
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,560
The area.

186
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,250
The type of stones.

187
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,522
Believe me, you're wasting your time.

188
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,851
Pity.

189
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,085
It was worth a try.

190
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,562
It's balm for the soul, isn't it?

191
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,923
What was it like to find them?

192
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,602
It was overwhelming.

193
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,244
Come on, Muller,
it's time to go.

194
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,771
The others are waiting.

195
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,807
The nuggets.

196
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,568
Oh yes. Of course.

197
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,327
He wanted to steal all our money.
The money we entrusted him with.

198
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,608
It's a mistake to believe that.

199
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,565
Belief is irrelevant.
The matter is obvious.

200
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,044
Let me explain.

201
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,769
You were right,
I have problems getting my bearings.

202
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,247
I just meant to ride ahead.
To find the best route.

203
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,682
So why did you take all the money?

204
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,971
My equipment is in the bag:
my compass, map and so on.

205
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,528
I'd forgotten about the money.
- Save your breath!

206
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,609
You've no idea about our route!

207
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,690
You were after our money.

208
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,609
This is a terrible misunderstanding.

209
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,610
He was toying with our lives.

210
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,569
When we get to Hazelton...

211
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,561
we'll turn him over to the police.

212
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,527
There are no police stations
in this godforsaken wilderness.

213
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,491
Here
you have to dispense justice yourself.

214
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,366
A pig like Laser
should be hung on the spot.

215
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,804
Have you lost your mind?

216
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,571
You're not the law.

217
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,491
The law is what you declare it to be.

218
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,449
Why don't we just let him go?

219
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,251
Sorry?

220
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,164
We let him go.

221
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,010
You want to let him get away?

222
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,885
What good is there
in dragging him around with us?

223
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,727
I don't mean to drag him around with us.

224
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,764
I say we hang him.

225
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,648
Yes, the swine needs punishing.

226
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,370
I'm in favour.

227
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,331
And you, Rossmann?

228
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,847
You can't shirk your responsibility.

229
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,490
Rossmann, speak up.

230
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,044
I'm in favour.

231
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,881
The majority is in favour. It's decided.

232
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,089
Laser shall be hanged at dawn.

233
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,045
Why don't we do it now?
- Because we're not barbarians.

234
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,687
Condemned men are always hanged at dawn.

235
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,609
You're making a bad mistake.

236
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,684
Thank you.

237
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,609
<i>I'll</i> never forget this.

238
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,843
Shut up and get out of here.

239
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,808
How could this have happened?

240
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,451
Laser can't have escaped on his own.

241
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,324
Let's not waste time.

242
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,801
We have to go.

243
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,083
I take no instructions from a packer,
Boehmer!

244
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,731
There's something to be cleared up first.

245
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,281
We need a new leader.
I nominate...

246
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,285
myself for the post.

247
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,164
That was brave.
I saw you do it.

248
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,324
Why didn't you do it yourself?

249
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,726
Do what?

250
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,770
Free Laser.

251
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,562
Laser's fate is all the same to me.

252
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,007
Is anything not all the same to you?

253
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,281
It's the Indians' hallowed ground.

254
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,131
They lay out their dead here
before burying them.

255
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,448
We'll have trouble
if we go through there.

256
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,201
Damn it, Boehmer!
Shall heathen superstition be our guide?

257
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,330
We'll get nowhere that way!

258
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,130
We ride straight on!

259
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,085
And how would he know?

260
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,527
He says he works the woods
and knows the land.

261
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,041
He says so.

262
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,242
People talk to pass the time.

263
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,491
Maybe he likes scaring strangers.

264
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,171
Maybe.

265
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,604
We'll go no further.

266
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,491
Maria!

267
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,085
Let's not be hasty.

268
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,804
I'm going no further.

269
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,761
<i>I'll</i> discuss it with my wife first.

270
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,203
There's nothing to discuss.

271
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,926
Maria!

272
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,885
Please.

273
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,885
We sold the restaurant.

274
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,163
Put all our money into this trip.

275
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,009
And now we're to abandon it?

276
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,446
Just look at you.

277
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,201
It'll take weeks
for your shoulder to heal.

278
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,045
We lost our wagon.

279
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,962
We shouldn't wait for worse to come.

280
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,127
And what would we do back in America?

281
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,607
We'll start afresh... somewhere.

282
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,290
As we've done before.

283
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,570
Let's sleep on it.

284
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,125
We go no further.

285
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,688
We wait till you're healthy,

286
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,730
then we turn back.

287
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,290
We've come far.

288
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,765
We'll manage the rest.

289
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,603
Giving up now would be a mistake.

290
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,007
We shouldn't forget what we came for.

291
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,561
The gold will compensate for everything.

292
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,321
I want to go on.

293
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,405
<i>I want to go on, too.</i>

294
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,531
As do I.

295
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,562
No wonder there are so few people
on this damn route.

296
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,441
We lose our way here while the others
rush onto the goldfields.

297
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,170
I hope there'll be gold left
by the time we arrive.

298
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,122
Don't do anything stupid, Muller.

299
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,007
What cursed bad luck!

300
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,086
Stepping on a bear trap
in such a huge land!

301
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,761
That's cursed bad luck!

302
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,047
If we do nothing, he'll die.

303
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,370
But what can we do?

304
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,084
You want to...

305
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,210
Are you mad?

306
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,885
We are not doctors.

307
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,681
None of us
have ever done anything like that.

308
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,689
It's his only chance.

309
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,447
If he gets gangrene, he's done for.

310
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,964
Just quit it, Boehmer.

311
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,282
Leave me here and ride on.

312
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,610
We leave no one behind.

313
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,007
Not even a pain-in-the-neck like you.

314
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,207
I won't make it,
you know it as well as I do.

315
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:06,803
Just quit it, Muller.
Of course you'll make it.

316
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,043
You have to do me a favour.

317
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,167
Take my camera and notebook

318
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:20,848
and send them to my paper
when you reach the next town.

319
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,290
Muller!

320
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,131
What's wrong?

321
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,885
Talk to me, Muller!

322
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,847
Is everything all right with you?

323
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,402
We killed him.
- What?

324
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,086
We killed Muller.
- Of course we didn't.

325
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,526
He'd have died
of blood-poisoning otherwise.

326
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,002
You mustn't reproach yourself.

327
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,125
Rossmann!

328
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,247
<i>We can look for him</i> again <i>tomorrow.</i>

329
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,362
And what if we don't find him?

330
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,204
Then we'll move on.

331
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,883
We can't just leave him behind.

332
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,924
What else is there for us to do?

333
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,371
When we decided
whether we would go on or not...

334
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,165
speak up!

335
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,804
If I'd turned back,

336
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,568
would you have gone on, anyway?

337
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,367
Is there a particular answer you expect?

338
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,928
Would you have gone on, anyway?

339
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,090
I may have done.

340
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,211
And you?

341
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,687
Would you have gone on without me?

342
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,570
I may have done.

343
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,648
Do you regret your decision?

344
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:29,050
There's nothing for me to go back to.

345
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,091
There's something
you should know about me.

346
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,080
I shot a man in America.

347
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,889
That was two years ago.

348
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,051
I was working on a farm in Virginia.

349
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,166
I had trouble with a couple of rustlers.

350
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,525
The dead man's brothers
were after my hide.

351
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,891
That's why I went to New York
for a short while,

352
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,761
where I read Laser's announcement.

353
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,323
What do you think of me now?

354
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,287
How far is it now to Telegraph Creek?

355
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,125
One hundred...

356
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,165
to a hundred-and-fifty kilometres.

357
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,290
Maybe more.

358
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,371
Stop handling me with kid gloves.

359
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,201
I'm worth no more than you,
you hear me?

360
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,809
Telegraph Creek?

361
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,168
How long did I sleep?

362
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,931
Long!

363
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,969
You look like a new man.

364
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,840
I feel like one, too.

365
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,288
It's still along way to Dawson.

366
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,047
But the going is easier from here.

367
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,803
We should rest up a few days,
then we'll see what's next.

368
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,645
Agreed?

369
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,208
Wish me luck, Carl Boehmer.

370
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:06,246
