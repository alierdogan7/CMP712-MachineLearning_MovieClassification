1
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,973
How disgusting... how evil...

2
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,179
Throw in the others too.

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,121
But we're only children.

4
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,052
Listen here, I don't like people like yourselves.

5
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:06,022
The only thing that matters to me is whether
you have enough money to buy your lives.

6
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:11,196
Let's try this... here is a dollar,
I will lend it to you.

7
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:17,999
Whoever brings it back to me good for them,
who doesn't well... it'll be worse for them!

8
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,189
This is mine.

9
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,193
Smile!

10
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,197
Thank you sir.

11
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,175
Continue to drink...

12
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,020
...I get nervous when someone stops drinking...

13
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:45,120
...and when I get nervous, I shoot!

14
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,007
You belong to El Diablo's bandits
and you're very stupid.

15
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:14,226
You should always inspect a building
before indulging in it!

16
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,191
Romero... where are you?

17
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,995
Stay calm... I'm going to deal with your friends...

18
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,084
Go on... outside.

19
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,028
It's Hud. The great Hud.

20
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,013
Get up...

21
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:35,230
Go and say hello to El Diablo for me.

22
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,139
Why do you let him go? He's a bandit!

23
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,152
He should be sent to the Sheriff at Blackstone.

24
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:51,987
He's free until the trial, I know you're 'Specialists'
at this kind of thing!

25
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:56,025
This is scandalous! Do something someone!

26
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,256
Do something with Hud?

27
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,067
No, I would rather keep my life!

28
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,207
Hello my friend Hud.

29
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,070
You're not my friend.

30
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,141
Listen, if you're intending to go to Blackstone,
watch out for the Sheriff there.

31
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:22,381
It's no longer allowed to carry guns
after that terrible incident.

32
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,220
It's good advice my friend.

33
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,985
I told you that Hud doesn't have friends.

34
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,959
We're young Hud, we'll come with you,
we'll conquer the world together!

35
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,008
I'm going by myself.

36
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,969
Sheriff, Sheriff... come quick.

37
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,107
They're all waiting for you, down at the office.

38
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,982
It's just I appreciate that, but the question
is what brings that outlaw here.

39
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,420
And we stupidly allowed you to disarm us.

40
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:47,059
The most dangerous man in the territory
rides into town and we're helpless.

41
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,993
I just want to uphold the law.

42
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,121
And I'll do it, but I ain't giving your guns back.

43
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,563
I'll protect you like I said,
only your guns stay right there.

44
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,297
I'm the law around here...

45
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,092
...until I quit.

46
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,117
- You and your deputy are all we have.
- What can two men do?

47
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:02,098
- You and your deputy are all we have.
- What can two men do?

48
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,132
You must not allow Hud to ride into this town.

49
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:08,135
- The man has a right to go where he wants.
- A man like Hud doesn't have any rights.

50
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:14,109
We've got the prison in Blackstone. When he gets
here I'll disarm Hud, I said I'd protect you and I will.

51
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:18,053
You can't disarm that savage. Hud knows more ways
to kill a man than God ever thought of.

52
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,990
Hud doesn't even need a gun.

53
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,127
Sheriff you can't allow him to ride in here.

54
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:29,124
Look gentlemen I know the story.
You're all running scared.

55
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:36,031
Charlie was Hud's brother right?
And Charlie was lynched two months ago here.

56
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,067
Brother Hud didn't like that.

57
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,315
But if that's why he's back.
He'll have to kill every man in this room.

58
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,012
Because we're all responsible for
what happened to Charlie.

59
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,044
You and me.

60
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,248
Maybe so but I refuse to let it be said
that I struck the first blow.

61
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,983
McClaine hit him first and that's what
started it all. Let him pay the piper.

62
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,018
Don't you try and lay it all on me.

63
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,463
After Wood here had clubbed him
down with his cane.

64
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:03,059
Now that's a lie and you know damn well that it is.

65
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:07,300
And if you want to, ask our lawyer here Jenkins.
He did all the dirty work and that's the truth.

66
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,167
He put the noose around his neck.
You can ask anybody here and they'll tell you that.

67
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,201
You just go ahead and ask.

68
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,143
The Sheriff is right.

69
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,245
You are all so stupid.

70
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,252
Yelling like a pack of wild beasts.

71
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,143
With Hud on his way into Blackstone.

72
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:32,994
Sheriff we are paying you to defend us.

73
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,091
If you're too frightened, to pitch yourself against Hud.

74
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,035
Then we shall have to turn elsewhere for our
protection.

75
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,037
Protection is the Sheriffs job.

76
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:44,065
He gets paid for it... badly sure.
But I'm here to uphold the law.

77
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,013
And by God I intend to uphold that law...

78
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,982
...or else!!

79
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,992
You were quite right.

80
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,129
We'd be fools to put our trust in him.

81
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,132
We all know Hud's reason for coming is to find the
cash.

82
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,067
We have the same interest as he.

83
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:15,098
The same goal... to find the cash.

84
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,030
Hey if you looking for my Pa mister, he ain't here.

85
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,100
What do you want here? I told you my Pa ain't home.

86
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,027
You stay out of here... yes.

87
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,229
What are you looking for?

88
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,132
Who are you?

89
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,120
What right have you got to walk into here, Mister?

90
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,128
You're Sheba, aren't you?

91
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,195
How do you know that?

92
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,242
Come along Sheba, you can help me.

93
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,013
- How long have you been living in this house?
- About three months.

94
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,021
My Pa bought this place after Charlie was killed.

95
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,246
You mean lynched... I reckon!

96
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,144
How many went after him?

97
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:52,096
10... 20... don't matter.

98
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,057
He's dead and buried. And they're still alive.

99
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,158
Don't let him find you here.

100
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:13,152
You little Hussie... I told you never
to talk to a stranger.

101
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,143
Is that clear?

102
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,155
You tramp.

103
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,229
That's mine.

104
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,144
You want to kill me, for a piece of paper?

105
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,125
Hand over that rifle.

106
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,196
And I'm fining you $5.

107
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:13,043
You know the law... no exceptions.

108
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,138
I laid down the law that nobody has the right
to carry a gun... Sheriff's orders.

109
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,082
You broke the law, so it'll cost you a $5 fine.

110
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,985
It's a good lesson for you.

111
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,013
You've can pay it in installments if necessary.

112
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,060
Or you can spend a week in jail... savvy?

113
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:20,001
I think you should know that you can't
enter the town bearing arms.

114
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,014
As you may have gathered I like to
see the law respected.

115
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:27,052
Why don't you just resign yourself
to not visiting Blackstone?

116
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:30,044
I don't make exceptions.

117
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,082
But if our rules don't suit you, you can
just keep riding on.

118
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:42,158
What I decide only I know... no one else.

119
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,966
But you know it's not really difficult
to guess your intentions.

120
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,100
Everyone knows the facts about...

121
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:56,103
Dallas, Yuma, San Antonio, Kansas City,
Oklahoma...

122
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,251
Your gun is famous.

123
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,187
No man could beat Hud in a gunfight.

124
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,285
Then you know who I am?

125
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,282
Everybody knows you.

126
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,020
You ought to what they're saying.
You'd think Satan himself was coming.

127
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:16,057
Huds coming... the great Hud!
Sheriff do something Hud's here!

128
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,260
However I do believe you'll give me your gun...

129
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,295
...I'm not joking.

130
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,270
Why do you think I'd really come back?

131
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:33,318
There's only one reason... to find out
the real truth about Charlie.

132
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,309
I want the facts.

133
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,047
I know how you feel.

134
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,057
Soon as you give up your gun, I'll help you.

135
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,642
Prepare the guest room at once. We've got company.

136
00:18:35,677 --> 00:18:37,138
Prepare the guest room at once. We've got company.

137
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,217
So... I see everyone is unarmed?

138
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,965
Eh... Sheriff?

139
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,999
Well nearly everyone...

140
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,276
Come on... move along now.

141
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,184
How have you been Valencia?

142
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:34,061
I feel like a disaster like this town... Blackstone.

143
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:37,168
I hope you're here to find the bank's missing dollars.

144
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,069
All my savings were there.

145
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,065
You mean the ones stolen from my brother?

146
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,313
Yes and then they got Charlie killed.

147
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:51,214
You know the dead don't talk.

148
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:57,011
Are you here to get his killer? Do you know who it is?

149
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:03,222
That's right. I'm here for him and everyone else.

150
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,124
And for me too? Don't forget little old me...

151
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,205
Come here winners and pick yourself a card.

152
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:28,084
Now we put the card in the miracle box and la la la la
...

153
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,081
Own your own mint gentlemen.

154
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,220
10 silver dollars buys this marvelous machine for
making money.

155
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:41,027
Well... is there no takers?

156
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,124
- Where are all the rich folk?
- They're all at home hiding.

157
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:47,101
Ever since Hud got back, you'd
think there was an epidemic.

158
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,130
Yeah... an outbreak of yellow fever.

159
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,005
Except me!!

160
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,273
He's like everyone else...

161
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,179
...but I'll tell you something...

162
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:59,082
When he faced me...

163
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,987
...he put his gun away...

164
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:04,251
...and left quickly.

165
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,025
Howdy Hud.

166
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,199
Hello Hud, you know me...

167
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,234
I always joke...

168
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,274
Yes... I like to joke too...

169
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,250
...sometimes.

170
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,272
Hey Boot you're like a lost sheep, what are you
waiting for?

171
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,286
A shepherd?...good for you.

172
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,122
Have you seen Hud... Sheriff?

173
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:19,026
Instead of going fishing you
should maybe go hunting instead.

174
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,064
I'm only interested in tryouts at the moment.

175
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,143
I glad to see you, Hud.

176
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:49,127
Visiting your brother.

177
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:54,032
Do you realize that if it wasn't for the sheriff and me
...

178
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:58,036
...your brother wouldn't even have been buried.

179
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:00,266
They looked upon him as a bandit.

180
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:07,301
I gave him my own coffin.

181
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,138
The one that I purchased for myself.

182
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:16,152
The one with the comfortable head cushion.

183
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:22,185
It cost me $15... yes it cost me $15...

184
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:27,093
I hope I won't need it myself.

185
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,191
- Wait a second.
- Yes?

186
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,263
Hello Hud.

187
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,111
I'm really happy to see you.

188
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,311
I'm probably the only one in town to feel this way.

189
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,216
But the sincerity of my sentiments are what's
important.

190
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,181
Friends as always?

191
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,251
I have no friends.

192
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,320
You haven't changed.

193
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,332
Still the same Hud.

194
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,201
Like when we were little... you recall?

195
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:07,103
You're the only boy who never tried to seduce me.

196
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,175
You've changed Virginia.

197
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,043
You were beautiful and young.

198
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,344
But now you're...

199
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,041
...you're all dried out.

200
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,345
Dried out?

201
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,980
You may be right.

202
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,991
A woman that stops making love does dry out.

203
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,325
You know...

204
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:38,325
There's no man here worth looking
at... they're trash all of them.

205
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:43,264
Since my husband's death I've felt so alone...
abandoned.

206
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:47,043
Abandoned?...you inherited a bank.

207
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:51,071
Huh... the bank... yes I want
to speak about that with you.

208
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:54,244
And about your brother Charlie...
...I trusted him you know.

209
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:58,255
He was to carry the bank's money in secret to Dallas.

210
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:02,021
I knew that El Diablo was planning to rob us
and I wanted to get the cash out of his reach.

211
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,127
The town people still blame me for that.

212
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,135
I had such faith in Charlie.

213
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:16,138
I lost everything.

214
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:21,076
In over three months...

215
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:25,105
...no one has deposited any money in my bank.

216
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,016
Sad to hear that.

217
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,153
When Charlie returned hurt and with no money...

218
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:34,317
They accused him of stealing and
you know what tragedy followed...

219
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:42,027
Since then I have always been lonely. Very lonely.

220
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,361
Hud...

221
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,097
...will I see you again?

222
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,375
Don't worry you will.

223
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,378
Hello there youngster.

224
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,979
My fish flew out of sight down here. Nice of you to
rescue it.

225
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,256
This is my fish.

226
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,158
Your fish... huh... I see you're kidding.

227
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,185
Give me it back now. C'mon.

228
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,198
Can you prove it's your fish Sheriff?

229
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,329
You own all the flying fish I suppose
...how do we know it's yours?

230
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:57,075
Apache taught the fish to fly. He gave
it to Rosencrantz and he lent it to me.

231
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,238
And I told the kids to hold it...
...so it's sort of everybody's fish.

232
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,370
Am I right?

233
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,416
Or maybe it looks like a fish you once
knew and you're confused... awe.

234
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:07,408
As you can see plainly, the fish is ours.

235
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:12,290
And that star you sporting indicates you
keep the law... correct Sheriff?

236
00:28:12,325 --> 00:28:14,281
The law... is the law.

237
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,294
Well I'll be... you really mean what you said?

238
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:23,164
You must know the old saying...
there's no fool like an old fool.

239
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:27,327
Kid... you said the wrong thing
...I'll show you...

240
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,004
You gone crazy?

241
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,071
Are you proud of yourself... you old bully.

242
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,242
Alright talk... what are you
'no goods' doing in Blackstone.

243
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:49,249
- Can I get an answer?
- Okay... we come from Dallas.

244
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:52,291
...we're looking for gold.
- Whose gold is that?

245
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:55,289
Awhh c'mon Sheriff everybody knows whose gold.

246
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:59,337
- Well tell me again then kid.
- The money stolen from the bank in Blackstone.

247
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:02,138
They say the Sheriff let the bandits get away.

248
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,588
And when he found them again...
...the money was gone.

249
00:29:03,623 --> 00:29:05,004
And when he found them again...
...the money was gone.

250
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,375
You might want us to help you find it perhaps?

251
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,210
Needless to say we'd expect a
reward for helping you to find it.

252
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,081
And for turning the money into you, Sir.

253
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,082
Yes, because Hud might want the money too Sheriff.

254
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,112
I think you've said enough.

255
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:22,994
You "no goods"...anything to do with
stolen money is my concern, as the Sheriff.

256
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:25,326
In Blackstone I'm the only law there is.

257
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:28,355
How do you kids know Hud? Is he a friend of yours?

258
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,028
Hud ain't got no friends Sheriff...
...don't you know that by now?

259
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,061
Sheriff... Sheriff...

260
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,367
Virginia Pollywood wants to see you at the bank.

261
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:44,107
She say's it's urgent... better get
down there right away.

262
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,286
Here's your lunch kid...

263
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,454
Let's go.

264
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,155
May I come in?

265
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,321
Anybody here?

266
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,994
I'm in here.

267
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,263
What are you doing in the closet.

268
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:46,366
Why sorry Widow Pollywood I got confused...
...sorry about that.

269
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,208
You expect to find anything? Come in.

270
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:54,015
No, no, no I thought you were in there.

271
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,087
In my closet? How silly.

272
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,278
Come in.

273
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,185
Do you mind pouring the water, before it gets cold?

274
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,385
Yeah... er

275
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:13,996
You're sure you don't mind, if we talk
while I'm in the bath?

276
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:16,005
No... no eh.

277
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,212
Is the water right?

278
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,418
Yeah... imagine so.

279
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,324
What a good dancer you are!

280
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,408
I er... I er... sort of think I'd better wait outside.

281
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,109
Oh no... why must you rush off like that?

282
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:59,139
I understand... you'd rather be with the boys over in
the saloon.

283
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:02,084
Men are so lucky to be able to have fun.

284
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,445
Here... Well take it.

285
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,428
Turn around.

286
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:31,339
I need to talk to you about certain things,
so it may take a long time...

287
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,442
- Would you open the champagne?
- Champagne?

288
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:39,046
I think you'll like it... it's just arrived from France.

289
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,388
You'll find a bottle over there by the table.

290
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,357
You'll enjoy it I'm quite sure.

291
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:55,463
You called me to talk about something urgently.
I wouldn't want to waste time.

292
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,474
You never waste time... with a woman like me sheriff.

293
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,979
Permit me to tell you my personal opinion of Hud.

294
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,280
Any stud players here tonight?

295
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,081
Sort of discouraging.

296
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,085
Howdy Hud.

297
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,192
Hud... I've got something to tell you.

298
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,976
El Diablo want's to see you.

299
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,579
He sent around one of his men.
You're to ride into the mountains.

300
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,147
He has something personal to tell you
and that it was very important.

301
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,282
But you won't tell the sheriff?
Only a fool would do it Hud.

302
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,982
What is this stuff? This ain't fit for pigs.

303
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,988
Valencia...

304
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,990
...your whiskey tastes like urine.

305
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:58,025
I think I'll complain to the sheriff.
He's gonna close up this pigsty.

306
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,195
Don't shoot off your mouth Boot.

307
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,401
They throw men in prison for slander, so don't tempt
me.

308
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,306
I still say your whiskey tastes like urine.

309
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,979
It's a brand that's yours.

310
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:13,040
Are you sure there's no urine in this rot gut.

311
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:17,014
You call this whiskey do you?

312
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,422
You talk too much Boot. Beat it.

313
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,449
You're getting on my nerves and that ain't healthy.

314
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:26,088
Well if you're that nervous,
why don't you take yourself a walk.

315
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,999
We're all friends here.

316
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:32,332
Man's got a right to kid ain't he?

317
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,168
Ain't no harm in that, is there?

318
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,348
Somebody... someone get the sheriff... hurry.

319
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,255
- Well don't stop sheriff.
- Well you hear that?

320
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,125
- Sounds like a row at the saloon. I'd better go.
- The boy's are being naughty men.

321
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,421
Silly... go on look for it.

322
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:10,030
Sheriff... what are you doing?

323
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,372
I'm sorry I reached for the soap I thought.

324
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:19,113
I really think I'd better get down there.
Sorry to rush off widow.

325
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,374
Thanks for the drink.

326
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,375
Right Boot, now we're gonna hear what happened to
Charlie.

327
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:53,380
You're gonna talk Boot.

328
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,046
- The truth and nothing but the truth.
- I don't know what you mean.

329
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,316
C'mon let's hear it.

330
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,975
Hud, watch out!

331
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,193
What's going on?

332
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:40,095
Hud, didn't start it Sheriff

333
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:56,076
Want to explain the cause of all this Hud?
It had better be good.

334
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:01,118
Hud didn't start it Sheriff... it was self defense.

335
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:05,452
This ain't self defense... it's a massacre.

336
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,377
- It's you.
- Who did you think it was?

337
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,076
My father.

338
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,482
Why do you still insist on calling him, your father?

339
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,388
Why?..

340
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:53,122
Have you... killed him?

341
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:59,967
Tell me all that you know,
you are the only person that I can trust.

342
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:06,000
I don't know much... the only thing I know
is that when Charlie got killed that night...

343
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:09,076
Yes... what happened that night?

344
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:12,241
When my father returned that night...

345
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:16,276
I heard him speaking with someone outside, I heard
...

346
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,256
"That son of a bitch played with us..."

347
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,258
"That son of a bitch played with us..."

348
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:25,251
...he must have hid the money"

349
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,255
All I know is that Charlie was innocent...

350
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,463
...he had been set up.

351
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,002
Sheba...

352
00:39:38,037 --> 00:39:38,997
Yes?

353
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:44,407
I want you to know that what I did tonight was
in defense, not for revenge.

354
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,015
And now what are you going to do?

355
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,319
I don't know.

356
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:59,017
Wait for me.

357
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,345
I'll show you when you abuse the sheriff!

358
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:30,283
I'll show you that I'm better than you.

359
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,021
Come out and face me.

360
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,033
Say that you're sorry.

361
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,359
Come out...

362
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,199
So, have you decided?

363
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,105
Come out...

364
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,445
Where are you hiding?..

365
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,151
...are you hurt?

366
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,027
I'm coming in to get you.

367
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,222
Hud.

368
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,127
Hud.

369
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,302
Hud... are you wounded?

370
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:22,068
I don't think so Sheriff.

371
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,472
How did you do that?

372
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,476
You're under arrest anyhow.

373
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:34,321
You're advised that anything you say may be used
against you.

374
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:38,225
You're a fool Sheriff... you know that?

375
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,324
And you're a sidewinding son of a bitching bastard!

376
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:51,169
It's true... my Ma worked in a kinda saloon in Dallas.

377
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,147
Where do you think you're going?

378
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,308
Going to see a friend.

379
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:06,016
You've been arrested... now you're mine.

380
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,354
You're going nowhere.

381
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:12,021
Damn it you're my prisoner... by God... where you
go I go.

382
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,467
Well where's your friend?

383
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:49,219
Chico write, Today on the fifth day of the summer.
Francisco El Pacoro called El Diablo...

384
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:52,416
...because everybody thinks he's a devil.

385
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:57,216
El Diablo has captured the sheriff of Blackstone.

386
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:03,294
El Diablo has captured Hud too, who was his friend.

387
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:07,326
But who is now with the gringo son of bitches.

388
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:09,500
You write...

389
00:45:09,535 --> 00:45:10,495
I've written.

390
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:16,537
Write so that everybody in the world including
these land stealing gringos know who El Diablo is.

391
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,414
Especially these son of bitches
who are standing there.

392
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:24,315
Congratulations Hud... you work for these Gringos.

393
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:31,324
They lynched your brother. And your friend
the Sheriff does nothing to stop them.

394
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:38,329
And what you do? You kill five of my men and
you spit in face of Romero.

395
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:41,303
Let me kill him, El Diablo.

396
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:43,329
You sound a lot better today Romero.

397
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,305
Romero.

398
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:55,049
Romero... I say who gonna get killed here.

399
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:02,548
You understand... he's a little nervous.

400
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:12,031
There... have one back.

401
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,468
That's enough...

402
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:19,542
If you want to fight you'll do it my way,
not the gringos...

403
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:24,237
You understand? Sheriff.

404
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:33,346
The sheriff is afraid, he won't fight.

405
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:52,488
Chico... this you don't write. But you write this.

406
00:46:52,523 --> 00:46:57,505
The sheriff very strong. El Diablo is much stronger.

407
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:02,480
He agreed to let the sheriff fight with him.

408
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:07,286
According to our old tradition...
prepare the gringo for "The Contest".

409
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,063
- Here I am.
- You were supposed to come alone.

410
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,279
The sheriff followed me.

411
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,487
This say anything to you?

412
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:46,291
What do you mean?

413
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:50,498
Who gave it to you?

414
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:56,997
One of my spies told me that someone stole half
a million dollars from Blackstone Bank.

415
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,011
I had my eye on this bank for many weeks.

416
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,072
But these son of bitches, they were here before me.

417
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,283
So I decide to catch the thief.

418
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:11,116
I'm much smarter than the sheriff
and I find the poor bastard.

419
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:13,121
He's your brother Charlie.

420
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:16,353
Half dead, hiding in a cave. Somebody was
supposed to meet him had shot him in the back,.

421
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,997
He'd hid the cash. But when I asked him
where the money was.

422
00:48:20,032 --> 00:48:21,396
He's too weak to answer.

423
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,527
Poor fellow.

424
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:30,495
That dollar bill... he gave me.

425
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:35,501
He was finished... dying...

426
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:41,540
...all I could say was Ave Maria.

427
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,346
Ave Maria?

428
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,250
Yes... Ave Maria.

429
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,420
Yes, his wounds were extreme...

430
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,453
...like those made by an animal... a wild dog.

431
00:48:55,032 --> 00:49:00,231
Those gringos will do anything for money...

432
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,034
...they used Boot to try and get it.

433
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,434
That's a fact.

434
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:13,150
That's very good, you understand. And all you have to
do is find the money and bring it here.

435
00:49:13,185 --> 00:49:14,139
Okay?

436
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,453
What about the Sheriff?

437
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,480
You're going to find the money
and bring it to me. Good!

438
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,153
What do you make of the Sheriff?

439
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:31,156
Ha... if he manages "The Contest"
he'll be free to go.

440
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,999
Hey Chico, get him a horse

441
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:40,077
...Hud will leave and will get us the money.
If he doesn't El Diablo will be furious...

442
00:49:40,112 --> 00:49:46,107
and he will kill the Sheriff and destroy
the town and it will be historic...

443
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,977
...write all this down, Chico.

444
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,987
You're forgetting something...

445
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,186
Me? no, no, no...

446
00:49:53,221 --> 00:49:55,185
What about my gun?

447
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:05,357
Here's your gun. Remember how we used
to draw on each other?

448
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:09,395
When we were kids.
You were always faster than me.

449
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:15,002
Then the Gringo's cut my right arm off,
after an armed robbery.

450
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,199
You went away to play with real guns while I stayed
back to teach my other arm to kill Gringo's...

451
00:50:19,234 --> 00:50:22,219
You went away to play with real guns while I stayed
back to teach my other arm to kill Gringo's...

452
00:50:22,254 --> 00:50:28,215
...and cut off their arms, legs and
something else off too.

453
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:34,487
Well I'll be... and with just one hand too!

454
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:43,106
That's right... and don't forget with my left hand.
Do you think you're faster? Hey Hud?

455
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:45,097
We draw... c'mon.

456
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:51,310
I ain't hankering to play with toy guns.

457
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:56,315
Ok now I'm leaving before "The Contest" begins.

458
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,317
Hurry and return, then we'll have our fight.

459
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,427
Good luck Sheriff, if it's true that
you're hard headed then you'll do well.

460
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,329
I'll find you Hud, I'll get you...

461
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,308
You stupid people.

462
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,015
Aren't you going to arrest them?

463
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,450
I can only take orders from the Sheriff.

464
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:31,253
What are we going to do?

465
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:34,086
Considering the Sheriff isn't here, we have to decide.

466
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:38,428
Firstly I think we should nominate a new sheriff.

467
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:42,057
But we've already got a candidate...
...the deputy Sheriff.

468
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:47,032
I've only ever been a deputy...

469
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:51,063
...and now you expect me to be Sheriff.
I happen to have a wife and children.

470
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,135
So let's nominate another.

471
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:58,170
Him for instance... he's young,
clever and knows everyone.

472
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:04,544
I honestly don't think it's my line of work.
Even though I don't lack the courage for it.

473
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:09,557
But of course if Madame insists
I'll do anything for her.

474
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,559
I think the only solution is to send a telegram
to Dallas, for a proper replacement.

475
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:17,432
Yes I think that's the only way.

476
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:22,268
We don't need outside help. We shall
deal with our problems, ourselves.

477
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:01,531
Listen to this...

478
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:12,140
Let's take his trousers down.

479
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:27,125
What are you doing?

480
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,563
You know that we like you.

481
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:32,560
Hey here's Sheba...

482
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:36,962
We would like to ask you to join us
in our revolutionary group.

483
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:40,408
We have never asked anyone before.

484
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:43,841
Here is the fruit...
I would like to join but I can't.

485
00:54:43,876 --> 00:54:46,538
But you're all alone and
you would have us as friends.

486
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,545
- Have a smoke.
- No thank you...

487
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,689
...I can't... I'm a girl!

488
00:54:56,724 --> 00:54:59,388
And what do you think I am?..

489
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:02,023
[General enticements]

490
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:24,281
You always seem to arrive at the right time.

491
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:32,189
Hud!!...We were asking her to join our group.

492
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,994
Get out of here...

493
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:39,960
...or I'll help you to do it...

494
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:44,463
...get out I said. Get out...

495
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,983
Since you've been away I've been worried about you.

496
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:06,985
The Sheriff is missing and they say you've killed him.

497
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:12,491
They say that they will get you
and do what they did to your brother.

498
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:18,197
Listen Sheba... when time is the Hail Mary?

499
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:22,207
At Six O' Clock... why?

500
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:27,106
I'll wait until daybreak...

501
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:40,325
...come and look.

502
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:54,403
Wait.

503
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,145
If it's a game... tell me.

504
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:12,317
Don't worry you'll understand.

505
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,543
Excuse me...

506
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:49,459
It's Charlie's gun from the photograph, isn't it?

507
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:55,260
You mustn't use his gun, problems can be resolved
...

508
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:02,275
...without violence, killing and pain.

509
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:06,476
I have never known that kind of life.

510
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:12,080
Maybe it's because you don't
want to know that kind of life.

511
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,485
Words don't count, Sheba...

512
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:25,261
Only facts do, especially when they are final...

513
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:27,458
...like death.

514
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:32,972
Do you want to see me...

515
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:37,303
...ruined like my brother...

516
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,106
...is that what you want, Sheba?

517
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:46,382
No, I just want to help you to forget.

518
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:40,003
You're here early Hud.

519
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,440
An early riser... huh! Well before the sun is out.

520
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:47,074
It must be a good occasion to visit the dead at this
time.

521
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:52,244
It's like this... maybe one of them will be happy
today.

522
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:23,345
Sun's up Oscar.

523
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:27,379
There used to be a hole in the wall right?

524
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:31,450
Yeah, plugged it up myself.
That's my job... keep the place tidy.

525
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:33,485
Of course I get paid for it.

526
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,980
Dig that grave up quick.

527
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,166
Go on hurry.

528
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,397
Grave digging ain't a hurry up job. Relax boy.

529
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:35,389
What's that... I'll don't remember burying that.

530
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:53,206
Now that was real smart... hey Hud?

531
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:56,107
Real smart... You could say TOO smart.

532
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:03,413
Good work, you got away from El Diablo.
How did you do that?

533
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,519
Trade secret.

534
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:09,014
Hand me that cash box.

535
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,026
Easy like.

536
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:17,330
You're making a mistake Sherriff.

537
01:02:17,365 --> 01:02:20,131
I promised that money to El Diablo.

538
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:22,569
You better give it to him, he ain't gonna like it.

539
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,008
Blackstone Bank it says.

540
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:30,079
Mistake I made was thinking your brother was
innocent.

541
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:32,479
I was a fool to trust him.

542
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:35,313
But all's well that end's well.

543
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:37,551
Show me those dollars?

544
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:40,452
You damn fool... why'd you do that?

545
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:44,483
- Shot him in the back just like Charlie.
- Shut up!!

546
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,122
That bullet proof vest of his saved him.

547
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:53,334
Run and get the wagon, we'll take him into town.

548
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:57,362
I swear to God, they ain't lynching
this here prisoner in Blackstone.

549
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:19,057
Hud... they got Hud.

550
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:21,457
I'll be. Sure didn't expect him back that way.

551
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:36,577
Virginia... come back to bed.

552
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,380
And close the window, you'll cool off.

553
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:42,213
Come Dearest I shall prove I'm the best you've ever
had.

554
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:45,054
You still haven't had the piece de resistance... you
lucky girl.

555
01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:48,251
Will you stop playing Romeo in a hurry
...get dressed.

556
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:50,258
Yes my sugarloaf.

557
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:53,091
Command me and I obey.
Doesn't that assuage your demon heart.

558
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,261
[Various muttering and complaining]

559
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,991
You give us our money.

560
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:12,211
Ah shut your mouths. Your money's safe enough.

561
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:17,483
The money ain't the only thing
they're worried about in Blackstone.

562
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,184
- Why don't you give them it Sheriff?
- They ain't going to to have it.

563
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:27,091
We'll put you up for impeachment I tell you Sheriff...

564
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:29,491
Get out of here all of you.

565
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:32,399
As long as I'm upholding the law here.
You do as I say.

566
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:36,995
Better take my advice and get the hell
out of here while you still can.

567
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:42,400
I told you you're going to get your money.
What are you coming to see me for.

568
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:44,502
See your banker.

569
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,345
See the bank I say.

570
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:26,345
Hud...

571
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:29,447
...I thought you were dead.

572
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:39,126
Don't worry Sheba, no son of a bitch
can kill me. I'll be alright.

573
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,427
It's a good thing you're here Sheriff.

574
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:45,239
We know the law, between us
we'll see it's respected.

575
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:48,072
Well they demand that you give
them back their money right away.

576
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,305
Yes and they're within their rights.

577
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:52,541
It's in everybody's interests
I think to return the money today.

578
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,440
No that's not possible.

579
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:58,282
I must first review the records.
To see if they check.

580
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:02,447
- Well how much time are you going to need?
- I don't know yet.

581
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:05,483
A day, should do it. I'll try it done,
as soon as possible, overnight.

582
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:09,554
Well that's darn nice of you widow.
It's mighty big of you to be so understanding.

583
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:13,162
I'll send my deputy over to watch the safe for you.

584
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,362
You're such a marvelous man, you know. Thanks.

585
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:21,366
So manly... hadn't you better talk to them?

586
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:24,375
Why I guess you're right. I'd better go. So long.

587
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:28,008
Oh just a minute Sheriff...

588
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:34,355
...this champagne is for you.

589
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:37,985
You deserve much more than this...
...please your good health.

590
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:42,192
How improbable, to think the great Hud
would fall the victim of such a sad situation.

591
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:46,162
The sooner that pig hangs the better off all of us.
That's the way I feel about it.

592
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:49,267
When our money's in our hands,
that's when I'll breathe easily.

593
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:53,441
The money will be safe in the bank.

594
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:56,468
I still think we should have put our man
with her to guard that safe until morning.

595
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,080
The Sheriff's on the job.
We don't have to worry.

596
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:02,107
He put his deputy to guard the safe and see
nothing interferes with the widow Pollywood.

597
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:05,120
Till she'd checked the records thoroughly.

598
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:08,146
You can sleep tonight boys...
you'll get the cash tomorrow, for sure.

599
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:14,387
Sheba, you can stay with me tonight if you want?
You should stay, you'll feel safer here.

600
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:23,094
Made in France

601
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:27,203
I'd offer you a little, only
I'm not allowed to break the rules.

602
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:32,105
Seems stupid, cos I'm the one who made the rules.

603
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:37,115
Yeah... besides that, there ain't enough
here for us both. It's my little reward today.

604
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:45,316
Hmmm it's bitter. Well I reckon
I just ain't used to champagne.

605
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:55,337
I never had a real bottle of champagne before.

606
01:07:55,372 --> 01:07:58,329
But I sure got one now.

607
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:02,405
A whole bottle and all for me. Yes that's something
huh?

608
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:06,538
Beer's my drink, can't afford champagne
on a lousy $60 a month salary.

609
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,422
But I didn't pay for this...
...a real woman gave this to me.

610
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:27,269
Yes Sir, now this business is over.
I figure to go over to Tombstone or Dallas and look for
a better job.

611
01:08:27,304 --> 01:08:30,067
Figure I could ask for $80 now.

612
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:35,533
Or $90! I think I'm worth more than $90...

613
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:42,340
Hud... wait and see...

614
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:47,256
...those donkeys can't put you in prison.

615
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:50,453
After all they can't prove anything.

616
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:57,157
You ain't done nothing, have you? And besides...
besides I'm on your side. You can count on that.

617
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:11,070
Hud... want some advice, stop playing with pistols.
It'll get you nowhere.

618
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:21,981
Better use your brain... no point in killing
...what are you going to do?

619
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:29,387
And you know what I'm going to do when I get to
Dallas.

620
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:34,158
First thing that I'll do... I'll go find me a wife.

621
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:40,470
Hmmm yeah a woman of my own. I'd like to settle
down.

622
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:46,205
Get us a house. I even thought about kids.

623
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:52,281
A handful of boys, my own sons.
Have them go to school, become presidents.

624
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:58,492
Have a Pa without a cent in his pocket... yeah.

625
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:30,141
Get the Sheriff...
Get the Sheriff... help me!

626
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:50,266
Hurry up... go and bring the carriage.

627
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:56,571
Sheriff

628
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:06,381
Hey Sheriff

629
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:10,181
Hey...

630
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:35,006
Hey... are you alright? Wake up.

631
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:41,165
Woahh... No one will find us here.

632
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:44,368
Oh you're a remarkable woman Virginia.

633
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,377
You're the kind of woman
you meet once in a lifetime.

634
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,454
Oh sorry...

635
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:57,084
...Oh you're lovely...
you know what we'll do...

636
01:14:57,125 --> 01:15:00,294
...we'll spread the money out on the ground and
I'll make passionate love to you on it.

637
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:05,528
- Nothing stupider than a man pretending he's in love.
- I love you I swear, I'd die for you Virginia.

638
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:10,061
- You're more stupid than I thought.
Yes stupid... stupid... I adore you...

639
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:14,074
...next to you this is nothing.

640
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:17,340
All this money and you... I'm yours Virginia,
I'll do anything you ask.

641
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:18,502
No...

642
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:51,308
Romero...

643
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:59,214
It's Charlie's money...

644
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:03,123
She wanted to burn the money... if you
burn the money than that means...

645
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:07,561
...it is false and if it is false then that means
that the real dollars are hidden somewhere else...

646
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:09,190
...do you know where?

647
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:16,138
[Hey Sheriff... hey sheriff! Give us our money
back!!]

648
01:16:16,173 --> 01:16:20,097
[General complaining]

649
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:34,550
- We've got to do something!
- You're darn right we had! We'd better go and find
the Sheriff.

650
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:38,526
C'mon let's get the sheriff.

651
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:46,532
El Diablo!!...hid... El Diablo's coming!

652
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:06,549
Oh God... El Diablo... he's sure to come in
here.

653
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:09,981
We've got to get out... hurry the back door.

654
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:41,054
Sheriff... Sheriff... doh Sheriff, wake up!

655
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:45,082
- They're out there... El Diablo's here!
- - We need some guns... unlock those...

656
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,529
...our guns are locked up.
- Where's Hud?

657
01:17:47,564 --> 01:17:49,360
- Hud's broken free.
- Free???

658
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:51,958
It's your responsibility Sheriff!

659
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:31,471
El Diablo greets you gringos!

660
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:35,101
You sons of bitch bastards!! How could you be so
stupid!

661
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:39,136
You've all been cheated and by a woman!!

662
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:49,414
Pablo... all these dollars... take them back.

663
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:53,417
You can't fool El Diablo. They are all fake.

664
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:57,057
The real money was hidden by this bitch.

665
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:03,038
The bitch took you all for a ride... gringo bastards.

666
01:19:03,073 --> 01:19:06,235
But El Diablo, he wants real money.

667
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:09,443
She's going to say where it is.

668
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:13,080
I don't torture her... I can't stand violence.

669
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:17,108
I'll be nice to her... I sure will love her. Then she'll
tell.

670
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:21,156
She's going to tell us where she hid all of your
money.

671
01:19:21,191 --> 01:19:26,355
She refuse to talk... she's gonna be sorry for it.

672
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,228
Diablo says so!

673
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:44,470
Romero... Pablo... go on muchachos you are the
first.

674
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:14,574
Bastards...

675
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:19,273
He's going out unarmed.

676
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,975
What do you expect there's thirty to one.

677
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:24,212
What good's a gun?

678
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:44,261
El Diablo... I'm not carrying a gun... I want to talk.

679
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:47,264
I ain't got no gun.

680
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:51,309
I want to talk to you... man to man.

681
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:06,089
Cos I know you are a man. And I respect you.

682
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:08,495
I ask you not to inflict this shame upon the own.

683
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,124
There ain't no reason for it. And you lower yourself
doing it.

684
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:15,292
You're crazy Sheriff. The Sheriff is supposed
to protect the people who are honest.

685
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:19,296
All you're protecting is this bitch.

686
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:23,211
If she's guilty of the crime you say, then the law can
judge her.

687
01:21:23,246 --> 01:21:25,412
And the law here's me.

688
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:29,042
The law is for gringos... but it is not for me.

689
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:58,546
It is better for us that you talk... because
it's no good, El Diablo get's upset.

690
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:00,537
My turn now.

691
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,155
Now talk Virginia...

692
01:23:00,575 --> 01:23:04,170
You're about to die.

693
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:07,974
So talk... and fast.

694
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:13,353
You tell me where you hid the real dollars.

695
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:16,983
- What the hell's going on?
- Who's that shooting... do you know?

696
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:21,018
Why it's Hud, by crikey... he's got El Diablo on the
go.

697
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:24,190
Come on talk.

698
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:27,358
The real money, it's in my house... in the stove.

699
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:31,268
Who killed my brother?

700
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:37,372
Tell them... Tell them who killed Charlie.
Go on tell the whole truth.

701
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:42,215
Boot killed your brother... I told him to kill Charlie.

702
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,447
He was paid... he was paid with the money
...the real money.

703
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:48,455
You bastards... I'm glad I stole it.

704
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:52,483
Your brother had nothing to do with it
...I used him.

705
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:56,531
Like I used all these idiots.
I detest them, I hate them, I hate the pigs.

706
01:23:56,566 --> 01:24:00,524
I needed money to get out.

707
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:04,561
I'm bored with these farm boys and peasants.

708
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:08,966
Well shoot... kill me. Go on shoot me.
I'm ready to die.

709
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:14,209
I don't care... get me out of here. Wait...

710
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:16,008
Damn you.

711
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:29,345
Hud.

712
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:36,153
Now we're gonna fight. Like in the old days huh?

713
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:41,163
Now we've got the same chance.
We find out who's fastest with left hand.

714
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:54,272
Chico... write... say that this afternoon El Diablo...

715
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:58,308
...the most greatest bandit in Mexico has killed Hud.

716
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:06,159
The greatest gringo pistolero of all...

717
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:09,391
...say that I kill him with
one shot between the eyes.

718
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:17,160
And write El Diablo is the fastest gun...

719
01:26:17,205 --> 01:26:21,198
...say he leave his money to all of Mexico.

720
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:26,970
So that the peasants enjoy
their defender's generosity!

721
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:35,078
...he's gonna write all that!

722
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:40,190
Diablo...

723
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:43,491
...Diablo... Diablo.

724
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:52,507
Chico... you change what I said... not fastest...

725
01:26:52,542 --> 01:26:54,498
...write second fastest.

726
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:31,540
Look... come here everybody.

727
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:37,116
What is it?

728
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:40,348
He's burning our money.

729
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:43,686
Stop... stop you can't burn that money.

730
01:27:43,721 --> 01:27:46,984
It's our money Hud. You can't burn it.

731
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:49,996
Please... please don't.

732
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:53,023
Hud... he's burning the money.

733
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:56,070
Why did you do that, it's our life savings.

734
01:27:56,105 --> 01:28:00,063
[complaining]

735
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:03,100
It's not funny.

736
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:06,147
Lynch him like his brother.

737
01:28:06,182 --> 01:28:09,139
String him up.

738
01:28:09,183 --> 01:28:12,175
String him up like his brother.

739
01:29:35,403 --> 01:29:39,403
- Is he better?
- His pulse feels right.
But he's losing blood.

740
01:29:39,604 --> 01:29:41,404
We must stop the bleeding.

741
01:29:41,805 --> 01:29:42,705
Let's call a doctor.

742
01:29:42,906 --> 01:29:47,806
- Call the doctor.
- I'm afraid the doctor will refuse to come.

743
01:29:48,007 --> 01:29:51,007
I will go.
I will make him come.

744
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:52,508
Hurry!

745
01:29:56,209 --> 01:30:00,709
Go on!
Go on Faster!

746
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:03,710
Faster!
You too idiot!

747
01:30:08,311 --> 01:30:11,511
Now that we have arms
we give the orders.

748
01:30:13,412 --> 01:30:15,912
Get undressed fast!

749
01:30:29,712 --> 01:30:32,612
Doctor! Doctor!

750
01:30:59,113 --> 01:31:03,613
There she is!
Come here!

751
01:31:07,513 --> 01:31:10,613
Let me go! Let me go!

752
01:31:19,214 --> 01:31:22,514
Hud now we have guns.

753
01:31:22,715 --> 01:31:24,015
We defy you!

754
01:31:24,516 --> 01:31:28,816
Come to see what we did.

755
01:31:29,017 --> 01:31:34,017
We are not scared of you.

756
01:31:34,018 --> 01:31:37,018
Come here and show us your courage.

757
01:31:37,219 --> 01:31:39,619
If you don't come we will 
kill all the town.

758
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:45,220
We will shoot all of them.

759
01:31:51,022 --> 01:31:55,022
We have Sheba too.

760
01:31:55,523 --> 01:31:58,823
Are you listening Hud?

761
01:31:59,624 --> 01:32:01,824
What are you doing?
Don't listen to them.

762
01:32:01,925 --> 01:32:03,525
Come on. Admit that you're afraid.

763
01:32:04,526 --> 01:32:05,926
You are afraid, right?

764
01:32:06,927 --> 01:32:12,027
Where did your courage go?

765
01:32:13,327 --> 01:32:15,427
I have to go.

766
01:32:15,828 --> 01:32:19,528
No don't go. You must stay here.
You are hurt.

767
01:32:21,529 --> 01:32:23,929
Give me my gun.

768
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:36,030
To do what? It's empty.

769
01:32:42,531 --> 01:32:46,531
- No! No!
- Shut up!

770
01:32:47,332 --> 01:32:52,332
Come on crawl! Faster than that!

771
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:54,133
Look Hud!

772
01:33:31,534 --> 01:33:32,734
Shoot!

773
01:34:06,935 --> 01:34:10,135
With his damned jacket
we won't do anything.
