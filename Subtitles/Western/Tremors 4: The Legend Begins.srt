1
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,152
Awful soft dirt in here.
Make sure you shore it up good.

2
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,231
It's like working inside a cow down here.

3
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,792
<i>Una vaca plata</i>
that is going to pay off my ranch.

4
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,440
Your ranch.

5
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,717
It's like a woman.
It's all you ever talk about.

6
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,758
Meanwhile, she's taking all your money.

7
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,196
And you, you spend
all of your money on whiskey.

8
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,989
- But you're going to miss me soon.
<i>- (roaring)</i>

Victor?

11
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,277
Victor?

12
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,472
<i>Jefe. Jefe.</i>

13
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,869
<i>Jefe,</i> Victor is gone.

14
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,635
- What do you mean, "gone"?
- We were working the face.

15
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,109
I know he couldn't have got past me.

16
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,272
- But now he's just gone.
<i>- (roaring)</i>

17
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,430

18
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,554
Aaaaargh!

19
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,393
Dammit.

20
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,349
<i>(miner)</i> Juan! Where are ya?

21
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,789
<i>(thuds and miners screaming)</i>

22
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,674
So many people leaving.

23
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,910
Is everyone rejecting us?

24
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,754
No, Fu Yien. They are leaving
because the mine is closed.

25
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,628
Maybe we need a different name.

26
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,633
- Perhaps it was not the best choice, huh?
- Maybe not.

27
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,676
Son...

28
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,472
Juan Pedilla, you've been looking at
that hat for a month. Buy it or don't buy it.

29
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,596
No, no. I can't afford it.

30
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,750
You take it on credit. Pay us later.

31
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,637
No credit!

32
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,518
Stan Kelton is leaving.
Loading up his wagon.

33
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,718
Stan too? Now we're a town
without a blacksmith.

34
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,509
It'll end up as a ghost town
if that mine doesn't reopen.

35
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,194
If everybody leaves,
who will buy our things?

36
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,431
No one.
And we'll go back to China.

37
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,672
Only way you going back to China
is if you learn how to swim.

38
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,032
What does I Ching say?

39
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,715
"Expect arrival of great conqueror."

40
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,758
<i>(clicking)</i>

41
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,914
The mine will not stay closed. That ore is
turning out a hundred ounces to the ton.

42
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,958
- Two hundred, my friend.
- Two hundred?

43
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,749
Well, nobody's walking away
from riches like that.

44
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,558
Nobody.

45
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,599
Well, if you saw what I saw,
you might walk away.

46
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,478
You never really told us what you saw.

47
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,630
I saw nothing.

48
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,474
But the nothing, it was worse
than anything I have ever seen.

49
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,279
You're not thinking of pulling out too?

50
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,430
No, I cannot do that.

51
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,796
- I would lose everything, like you.
- Like all of us.

52
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,519
Listen. It's about the mine.

53
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,752
The owner of the mine is coming.
All the way from Philadelphia.

54
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,071
He say "Low profit
from mine unacceptable."

55
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,435
"Proceeding with all dispatch."

56
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,718
"Will take matters into hand personally.
Signed, Hiram Gummer."

57
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,268
That's a real two-dollar name.

58
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,071
I'll wager he gets this thing solved faster
than a bee with a horse on its tail. Betcha.

59
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,432
The stage is coming! It's coming!

60
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,948
Tecopa! Miss Christine!
The stage, it's coming!

61
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,992
- What do you think he looks like?
- He's probably fat.

62
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,150
Rich people are always fat.

63
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,556
Oh, my word.

64
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,632
- Anybody in there?
- It's full of luggage.

65
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,229
- It's about time.
- Indeed it is.

66
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,515
- Let me in.
- Can't wait to leave this place.

<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

68
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,795

69
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,108
Mr. Hiram Gummer?

70
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,118
I am he.

71
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,636
I am Tsang Pyong Lien.
Pyong Chang.

72
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,393
This is my market.

73
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,755
- You're not very fat.
- Quiet!

74
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,068
Whooee.

75
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,312
You must have enough money
to burn a wet mule, huh?

76
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,109
Mr. Gummer, I'm Christine Lord.
Proprietress of the local hotel.

77
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,395
You're lovelier than Fifth Avenue in spring.

78
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,278
- Welcome to Rejection.
- Aptly named, it would seem.

79
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,753
I'm here to see Andrew Beckwith. I've sent
him three communiqués, all unanswered.

80
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,389
- I want to speak to him forthwith.
- That might prove difficult.

81
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,155
- Why? Where is he?
- On that. The last stage out of here.

82
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,037
Wh?

83
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,830
- That's just dandy. The last?
- Too few passengers.

84
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,959
The mine closed several weeks ago.
That is why you're here, isn't it?

85
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,036
Closed? The mine closed? I feel I've not
been privy to most needful information.

86
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,509
You don't know
what happens at the mine?

87
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,832
17 miners were killed in one day.
The workers abandoned it.

88
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,478
17? What on earth happened?

89
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,949
- No one knows.
- Must you speak in riddles?

90
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,079
- The only one who knows is Juan Pedilla.
- Then I must see him straightaway.

91
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,039
Well, he's out riding his land.
We expect him back shortly. Please.

92
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,795
You must be tired from your traveling.
Let me show you to the hotel.

93
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,351
Oh, very well.
Come, I'll need assistance with my kit.

94
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,990
This is our bank. Closed, of course.

95
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,437
Our blacksmith, also closed.

96
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,238
- And our post office.
- Closed.

97
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,596
- Of course.
- Quite the bustling metropolis.

- And this is my hotel. Welcome.

100
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,989
Right this way.

101
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,196
An impressive arsenal.
Are you a collector?

102
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,840
The miners came west to strike it rich.

103
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,278
When it came time to settle their bills,
many of them had only their firearms left.

104
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,798
- Now I collect payments daily.
- Nonsense. Just keep a running tab.

105
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,239
Your man is rather impudent.

106
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,392
Tecopa is not my "man". He is my friend.

107
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,913
But this is a tent.

108
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,389
Yes. You're observant.
Which would you like?

109
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,995
This one right here.

110
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,435
Dandy.
What time will luncheon be served?

111
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,229
Well, since the mine has closed
the supply wagons have stopped,

112
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,949
so our menu's a bit limited.
I could fix you a pot of beans.

113
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,640
Nonsense. Surely you have flour,
molasses and ginger?

114
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,952
I should like a gingerbread cake.
Yes, that should do nicely.

115
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,157
You want me to strangle him?

116
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,629
No, we need him.

117
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,193
<i>(# piano)</i>

118
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,633
Delightful music and a passable meal.
Which I should like to end with an aperitif.

119
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,915
Wouldn't we all?

120
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,596
Fu Yien, would you like
that last piece of gingerbread?

121
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,590
Yes.

122
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,878
Then go to my small carpet bag, the blue
one, and fetch my bottle of peach brandy.

123
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,951
Yes, sir.

124
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,359
- What happened to the gingerbread?
- I ate it, of course.

125
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,238
- But you said I could...
- A word of advice, young man.

126
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,440
Anyone can be taken advantage of,
and if you can, do.

127
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,510
That is terrible advice to give a child.

128
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,750
The boy must learn
the ways of the world.

129
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,400
I assure you, he knows them.

130
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,358
- Juan's here. He's over at the store.
- "Juan"?

131
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,352
Juan Pedilla, the miner.

132
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,795
Oh. Yes, yes.

133
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,516
No, no, no, no.
The mine is not played out. Not at all.

134
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,151
There's plenty more silver in there.
It's just no one wants to go in and get it.

135
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,550
Seven more men go up since accident.
None come back.

136
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,599
My ancestors talked of spirit beasts
that live inside those mountains.

137
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,795
"Spirit beasts"?

138
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,316
Beasts from the underworld.
Blind to all but killing.

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,276
Have you all taken leave of your senses?

141
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,629
Juan, gather up the remaining miners,
hunt down whatever is doing this...

142
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,316
And fill 'em full of more holes
than a cabbage leaf in a hailstorm.

Precisely.

144
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,878
Señor Gummer, there are some miners
camped north of town. I can talk to them.

145
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,318
But they are not going to go back unless
you pay them. Maybe even double wages.

146
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:02,555
- Pay them? To earn their own jobs back?
- I'm just telling you, they are scared.

147
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,919
Very well. To ensure my resources are not
squandered by this cabal of hooligans,

148
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,117
I shall accompany you myself,
first thing in the morning.

149
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,513
Now you're talking. What kind of gun
did you bring? Betcha it's big and fancy.

150
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,875
I don't own a firearm.

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,995
This is the Wild West, Mr. Gummer.
You don't read the dime novels?

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,309
Señor, it is a hard day's ride
over very rough country. Uh...

This is the cross-country model.
The horse can carry my kit. Off we go!

Deplorable road conditions.

160
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,432
Um...

161
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,396
No, no, I'd like some, uh...

162
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,677
Maybe just... Thank you.
Ah, very good.

163
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,956
I haven't been on a horse since I...
since my sixth birthday party.

164
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,508
No, actually, that was a camel.

- Yes?

00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,351
- This is for you.
- I beg your pardon?

00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,512
You really think
he is "great conqueror"?

170
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,160
Only if he rides a camel
better than he rides a horse.

171
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,234
Let's not judge yet, Tecopa.
He's the only chance we have.

172
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,431
Howdy, gents.

173
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,350
- This is our army?
- These are the only ones willing to go.

174
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,557
All the better.
No need to waste my money on cowards.

175
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,598
Men, this is the <i>patrón,</i>
Mr. Hiram Gummer.

176
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,752
These are the Walter brothers,
Brick and Stony.

177
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,559
- This is Big Horse Johnson.
- Mr. Johnson.

178
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,835
And this is Soggy.

179
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,558
Soggy?

180
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,990
Indeed.

181
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,070
Well, in you go.

182
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,709
- And what?
- And report back to me.

183
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,799
Oh, very well.

184
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,429
As none of you possess
sufficient leadership skills,

185
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,990
I shall supervise the endeavor myself.
Juan?

186
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,071
<i>Vámonos.</i>

187
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,476
- Wait.
<i>- (Juan)</i> That was our foreman.

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,710
My hat.

Urgh.

190

191
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,235
Try it on.

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,435
Thank you,<i>jefe.</i>

193
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,391
Oh, my.

194
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,438
This is the end of the mine,
where Victor was.

195
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,115
Well, we're still alive.

196
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,193
Whatever attacked you,
it would seem to be gone.

197
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,719
Gentlemen,
I declare this mine perfectly safe.

198
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,473
Dang right.
Ain't nothin' in there but ghosts.

199
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,949
You don't need to pay them no wages.

200
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,634
I pray that we are correct.

201
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,473
Well, sun's gettin' low.
Might as well set up camp.

202
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,468
We can't camp here.

203
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,237
I need trees.

204
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,711
<i>(chuckles)</i>

205
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,998

00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,116
Oh, damn.
You gonna start torturing that thing?

208
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,509
Helps me sleep.

209
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,633
- And the horses like it too.
- Well, go play it for them.

210
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,555
Ain't my fault you lack a musical ear.

<i>(Soggy plays concertina)</i>

212
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,479
How soon do you think
you can reopen the mine?

213
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,348
Posthaste. The sooner the better.

214
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,998
Good.

215
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,870
Because I need to keep working
if I don't want to lose my ranch.

216
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,315
I thought you were a miner.

217
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,919
Well, I am a miner, but my father always
dreamed of having a ranch for us one day.

218
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,638
And?

219
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,555
He was killed in a cave-in
when I was a boy.

220
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,589
My mother, she moved us
from mining camp to mining camp.

221
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,437
They always need a woman
to do the laundry and the cooking.

222
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,159
I've been without my cook for weeks.

223
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,630
You always had everything, didn't you?

224
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,154
Several of everything.

What a dreadful odor.

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,275
I smelled it in the mine.

265
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,238
It was them.

266
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,118
They came up through the soft dirt.

267
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,873
At least it can't penetrate rock.

268
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,960
<i>(Gummer)</i> It has no eyes.

269
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,152
How did they find us?

270
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,835
It's the sound. Every time
we made a sound. Even your teapot.

271
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,229
That's how they hunt.

272
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,676
We can't just stay here.

273
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,797
These foothills are made of rock. We can
walk on them all the way to Rejection.

274
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,236
- Walk?
- Well, unless you can fly.

275
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,279
Tecopa, what are you doing?

276
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,271
Diggin' a spot for a flagpole.

277
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,480
A flagpole? Does it concern you
that Nevada hasn't yet adopted a flag?

278
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,075
We will one day. I'll be ready.

279
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,549
They're back! They're back!
It's Juan and Mr. Gummer! They're back!

280
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,588
I'd have walked twice that far to get away.

281
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,513
Those are the most savagerous beasts
I've ever seen.

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,434
Well, didn't you let loose?
Let fly? Barrels blazing?

283
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,478
Old Fred, you don't understand.

284
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:01,759
When they're not underground,
they're... flying. Very fast.

00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,758
- If you can abide the racket.
- The work would go faster if you'd help.

339
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,833
A man of my means
doesn't engage in physical labor.

340
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,195
Which brings us...

341
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,275
to your bill.

342
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,077
- You're running a tab.
- I didn't agree to that.

343
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:53,110
Mrs. Lord, in any civilized place
my name alone is quite sufficient.

344
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,751
Well, out here in the rough-and-tumble
West, we tend to use cash.

345
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,435
That is a twenty-dollar gold piece
on your watch fob, isn't it?

346
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,478
And the watch itself is gold, of course?

347
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,235
And the cufflinks? Genuine diamonds?

348
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,992
Are you proposing that I barter with you
as I would a street vendor in Calcutta?

349
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,640
Don't be absurd.
You will run a proper tab

350
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:22,068
until this pathetic town has a proper bank
to which I can wire funds.

351
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,279
Here, now. What is going on?
Why aren't you riding that wheel?

352
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,557
No time. I'm working.

353
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,438
You men will take forever.
Using a boy to do a man's work?

354
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,509
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

355
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,591
Very narrow down there.

356
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,434
He's the only one
small enough to widen it.

357
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,799
The moment it is wide enough, I expect
to see one of you down there in his place.

358
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,553
And he back on that bicycle.

359
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,830
Mrs. Lord, I should like to apologize.

360
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,236
The truth is,

361
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,678
my coin, watch and cufflinks
are all I own in the world.

362
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,709
I beg your pardon?

363
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,349
My father, in his final demented days,

364
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,672
sold all his holdings and invested
everything, the entire family fortune,

365
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,149
in a certain silver mine.

366
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,713
I see.

367
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,076
I was rude earlier. I apologize.

368
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,436
Once I get the mine running,
I'll pay my bill in full

369
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,478
and be on the first stage out of here.

370
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,392
<i>(thunder)</i>

371
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,756
As Old Fred would say,
that's a real gullywasher.

372
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,196
Don't look at me.
I had nothing to do with it.

373
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,750
I hope Old Fred made it
to the muling station before this hit.

374
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,071
Yesterday a desert, today a monsoon.

375
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,149
Once I reopen the mine,
the whole town will prosper.

376
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,313
You'll be able to afford
whatever your hearts desire.

377
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,437
And what is it that your heart desires,
Mr. Gummer?

378
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,715
To return to the life I had.

379
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,635
To wake up every morning and wonder
"What will I spend my money on today?"

380
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,271
I'd venture it matters not how you spend
your money, but how you spend your life.

381
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,591
- Mr. Gummer?
- Don't interrupt your elders.

382
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,270
Never you mind, Miss Lord.

383
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,990
I'll amend my misspent life
when the Grim Reaper comes calling.

384

<i>(thunderclap)</i>

385
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,515
I recommend that
you keep that hog leg skinned,

386

unless you got a desire to be
jumpin' over hot coals in hell.

387
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,594
And who might you be, sir?

388
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,069
- Kelly.
- "Black Hand" Kelly?

389
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,438
I'm lookin' for Hiram Gummer.

390
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,756
That would be me.

391
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,594
- You posted yourself an advertisement?
- I did. Yes, I did.

392
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,514
So who do you want me to kill?
That Injun over there?

393
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,589
No, no, no, no.

394
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,992
It's not so much a "who" as a "what".

395
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,748
They spring from the ground like, uh...
like some demonic trout.

396
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,718
We call them "dirt dragons".

397
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,838
This stuff sure must be
a whole lot stronger than it tastes.

398
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,916
We're well aware that it sounds fantastic,
but we can assure you it's all quite true.

399
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,035
- They're ferocious and fast.
- It takes real backbone to face 'em down.

400
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,113
Amigo, I like to fight with rattlesnakes
just for the fun of it,

401
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,556
and I give 'em first bite to boot.

402
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,111
Hyperbole aside,
you are accurate with a firearm?

403
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,432
- Questioning my abilities, sir?
- As an astute businessman, I'm simply...

404
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,590
Hey, boy!

405
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,435
- Toss me one of them apples over here.
- See, I knew it. Shoot inside house.

406
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,998
- Throw it high?
- No, no, no.

407
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,117
- You throw it right straight at me.
- OK.

408
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,397
- You ready?
- Anytime.

409
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,513
- What?
- We thought you shoot apple.

410
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,149
Obviously we were expecting
to see a demonstration of...

411
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,831
You're hired.

412
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,151
- In China, no one shoots in wall.
- In China, no one has gun.

413
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:36,079
Before I sign up for anything, talk to me
about that "salary negotiable" part.

414
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,315
Do you like silver, Mr. Kelly?

415
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,038
I reckon I do.

416
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,192
Upon dispatching all the
aforementioned creatures,

417
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,636
and upon the reopening of the mine,
you'll be paid in silver.

418
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,759
Say, um... as much as you can carry
on a strong horse?

419
00:39:53,840 --> 00:40:00,234
Well, now, I just bet that you could
charm a cow right out of her calf

420
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,629
with those fancy words.

421
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,748
But now, for myself, I sorta need
a little something up front.

422
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,715
We don't have any money.

423
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,077
Ah, well.

424
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,628
Thank you for your time.

425
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,513
Double eagle.

426
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,068
A down payment.

427
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,668
Tell you what. You throw in
them there cufflinks and, uh...

428
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,558
you got yourself a deal.

429
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,230
This is one sorry collection
of lead pushers you got here.

430
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,834
I'm not running a gun store, Mr. Kelly.

431
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,469
Juan, you take this here big old 45-70.

432
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,714
Hiram, pick yourself out
something that feels right in your hand.

433
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:33,433
And you give us all these
blue whistlers that you got.

434
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,557
Juan.

435
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,434
- Take this.
- Oh, <i>pero no.</i> I still can't afford it.

436
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,876
No credit. It's a gift.

437
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,678
<i>Gracias.</i>

438
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,113
What?

439
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,078
No one goes without a hat in China.

440
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,754
OK, boys, let's jingle some spurs.

441
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,833
No. No. No spurs.
In fact, no jingling of any kind.

442
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,229
I tell you, these things are attracted
by the slightest noise.

443
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,790
They could leap from the ground
at any moment.

444
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,878
Juan killed one right here.

445
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,751
Shh, shh, shh.

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,632
There ain't nothin' here neither.

448
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,188
Maybe they gone deaf.

449
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,429
Or maybe you two boys
are playing me for the fool.

450
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,114
After what I paid you?

451
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:50,554
- We will just have to keep looking.
- Juan, if you please, some help.

452
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,995
Gummer, dag nab it,
ain't you got no pride?

453
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,674
Get up on the horse by yourself!

454
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,470
Should I ever again require horsemanship,
I will engage a tutor.

455
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:12,440
Well, I'll tell you one thing. I ain't got
your book-learning, but I know this:

456
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,751
Being full-growed don't make you a man.

457
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,472

They appear to be... shells. Eggs.

460
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,158
Well, if that's what they are...

461
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,677
then they came out of one big chicken.

462
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,834
Or maybe you two aren't as crazy
as I've been thinking.

463
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:04,036
This is where we pipe
the hot spring from the mine.

464
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:09,148
The water cut through the dirt, you see?
And the eggs fell out.

465
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,198
Perhaps the warm water hatched them.

466
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,670
Juan, this tells us how many there are.

467
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,794
There are four. And I killed one already.

468
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,758
- Three left.
- But where could they have gone?

469
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,674
Well, we're just gonna keep on ridin'
till we find them,

470
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,392

to unravel me some cartridges.

471
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,477
<i>(Juan)</i> We piped that hot water out
only six months ago.

472
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,553
<i>(Gummer)</i> Then those creatures
grew large quite quickly.

473
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,672
That's a part of one of them.

474

Yeah? Well...

475
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,832
Maybe one of them there "things" died.

476
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,596
Or maybe... maybe he shed his skin,
like a snake.

477
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,353
Who is that?

478
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,599
It's Old Fred. At least, that's his wagon.

Well, I'm not totin' no more rocks.

Take off your hat.

490

That is why we called him Old Fred.

492
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,753
He drove the freight.

493
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,469
He had bad breath.
But I don't want to say that.

00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,232
If you think I'd risk
sleeping on the naked earth...

505
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:00,632
We could go down to the muling station.
Down the canyon.

506
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,358
- Is it safe?
- Yes.

507
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:08,072
There are thick beams on the floor for the
wagons. The dragons can't break through.

508
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,798
- Might there be someone here?
- No.

509
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,155
They stopped the supply wagons
now that...

510
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,755
Now that the mine is closed.
The bitter refrain of my life, it seems.

511
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:39,197
We must secure these horses with
certainty. The last time, they got away.

512
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,068
You just make sure
that gate is tied up tight.

513
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,632
Mr. Kelly!

514
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,193
You can't see the door
if you're facing this direction.

515
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,874
Always be prepared.

516
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,231
<i>(snores)</i>

517
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,752
<i>(snores loudly)</i>

518
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,149
Aaargh! <i>¡Sálvame, Dios!</i>

519
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,673
<i>(shrieking)</i>

520
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,880
What in God's name?

521
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,115
- So was that them?
- No.

522
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,952
No.

523
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,793
Something new.

524
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,871
<i>(cartridges clink)</i>

525
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,719
<i>(shrieking)</i>

526
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,278
<i>(feeble bang)</i>

527
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,430
You said to pick one
I was comfortable with.

528
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,593
You're right. I did say that.

529
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,477
<i>(sniffs)</i>

530
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,909
What in Sam Hill is that smell?

531
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,149
It's them. That's the smell.
Remember, señor?

532
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,869
But they've changed so.
Become long and thin.

533
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,838
There's six of them,

534
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,751
or even nine.

535
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,995
We'd better bring the horses inside.

536
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,159
<i>¡Chingada!</i>

537
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,276
They're gone! Again!

538
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,550
We can't go on foot.
They'll get us for sure.

539
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,677
All right. All right.

540
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,548
That means we have to
stand our ground here.

541
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,475
Hiram, it's about time you learned
how to use a real piece.

542
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,599
That's your job.
If I need a gun fired, I hire a gunman.

543
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,672
If you want to bed down
with a real pretty woman,

544
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,558
I s'pose you just
hire somebody to do that too.

545
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,518
Spare me your tiresome analogies.

546
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,749
Hiram.

547
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,594
Now, I said this once,
and I'm gonna say it one more time.

548
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:27,949
There are some things a man has to do for
himself, and right now shootin' is one.

549
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:33,512
And give me that stupid hideout piece.
It ain't gonna do you no good now.

550
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:42,914
OK, Juan, you keep your eye peeled
for them there snake things.

551
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,755
Pay attention, Hiram.
Now, this is a single-action Colt Army.

552
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,037
This is the finest wheel gun ever made.

553
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,230
Don't be holdin' it like it's some skunk.

554
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:01,758
Now, it's an extension of your hand, OK?
It's part of you.

555
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,991
- And take a stance, like you mean it.
- Mean what?

556
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,278
Like you mean that every last lead plum
that comes out of that barrel

557
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,828
is gonna kill whatever you aim at.

558
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,277
OK. OK. Take yourself a shot
at that can over there by the window.

559
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,557
You line up this blade with this notch

560
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:24,111
then you just squeeze the trigger.
You don't jerk it.

561
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,516
<i>(rumbling and creaking)</i>

562
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,835
It's all right. They cannot
break through the floor beams.

563
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:46,598
Now, you just relax, you just let your eyes,
your brain, your hand, your trigger finger,

564
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,240
all becomes one.

565
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,708
<i>(rumbling)</i>

566
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,959
<i>(rumbling continues)</i>

567
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,600
It's all right.
You got consistency now.

568
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,468
- This is a waste of time!
- What do you expect?

569
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,075
You wanna learn in 20 minutes
what took me 20 years?

570
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,872
They cannot break through the floor,
so they are tearing it apart.

571
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,315
How could a snake be so strong?

572
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,391
<i>(whoosh)</i>

573
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,152
- Look at that. They decoyed us.
- Good Lord. How smart are they?

574
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,518
<i>Está malo.</i> We're gonna have
nothing left to stand on.

575
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,957
- Telegraph?
- It is no good for us.

576
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:06,955
- We don't know the clicking code.
- Click anything. Someone will hear us.

577
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,269
<i>(Fu Yien)</i> I don't know what it is.
It's not Morse.

578
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,033
<i>(Christine)</i> It's been going on
for more than an hour?

579
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,159
Maybe a tree is touching the wire.
That happened before.

580
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,719
This is different.

581
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:39,909
The telegrapher at Carson City wouldn't
allow foolishness with his equipment.

582
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,232
- Maybe not Carson City.
- Not Carson City? Where else?

583
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,752
This is from Carson City.

584
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,392
Where's that one from?

585
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:12,314
This is from the muling station. It must be
Mr. Gummer. He's the only one out there.

586
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,710
- When will Tecopa and Pyong be back?
- One, two days.

587
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,155
Gone upcountry. Getting firewood.

588
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,232
All right then. I'll go myself.

589
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,839
Must you tap so loudly?

590
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,870
<i>(creature roaring)</i>

591
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,671
Let your lead fly, man!

<i>(shrieking)</i>

593
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,474
<i>(creature roaring and howling)</i>

594
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,072
What the hell are we up against?

595
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,628
They... they grew.

596
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:30,471
Those snakes are not snakes.
They are tongues. Three tongues!

597
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:35,076
- Each creature has three tongues.
- And we saw nine before.

598
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,630
- So there's still only three animals.
- That's supposed to make me feel better?

599
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,508
Good God, man, those things are
the size of eight-mule freight wagons!

600
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:50,879
- Well, shoot them, like you're hired to do!
- You got to know your enemy, Hiram!

601
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,550
I oughta be totin' some eight-bore
firin' solid shot.

602
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,838
Or some damn punt gun.
Not these weapons I got.

603
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,838
All right. All right.

604
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,151
I tell ya what we're gonna do.
We're gonna... we're gonna...

605
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,913
We're gonna hold our fire
till they come after us.

606
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,438
And then... and then we're gonna go
toe to toe, point blank, full bore,

607
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,795
throw all the lead we got at 'em.

608
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,271
And then maybe we'll get a... a lucky hit.

609
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,669
A brain shot or something.

610
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:55,513
- There is not much floor left.
- They'll be makin' their move anytime.

611
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,515
Get ready.

612
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,398
This may be it.

613
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,471

615
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,710
Now what are they up to?

616
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,435
Oh, no!

617
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,078
Mr. Kelly!

618
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,915
Eat this!

619
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,359
I'm out! I'm out!

620
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,994
Christine is coming, Señor Gummer!

621
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,672
Christine! Over here!

622
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,916
Just drive the wagon!

623
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,278
<i>- (Christine)</i> Where's Mr. Kelly?
<i>- (Juan)</i> Dead. Go on! Go on! Go!

624
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,151
Well done, Mrs. Lord!
Are they following us?

625
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,798
I can't tell.

626
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,837
Yes, they are following us.

627
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,831
<i>(roaring)</i>

628
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:07,989

01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,037
- They're at their limit. Hyah! Come on!
- We shall see.

630
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,237
<i>(horse whinnies)</i>

<i>(snarling)</i>

632
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,034
They're enormous. Ravenous.

633
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:48,672
"Spirit demons from dark places,
eating souls that live in the light."

634
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,949
Part of our legend.

635
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,555
We put bullet after bullet into them.
It didn't even slow them down.

636
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,834
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

637
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,753
Will they come here? To our town?

638
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,719
They'd have to get through the pass.
Lots of rocks. Maybe they cannot do it.

639
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,952
It hardly matters.
The mine will remain unapproachable.

640
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,120
So what is your intention?

641
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,671
My intention is to leave this godforsaken
place, as should all of you.

642
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,318
But the mine...

643
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,678
Are you listening?
The mine is lost. Forget the mine.

644
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,551
Go on with your lives as if it never existed.
Start your lives over, just as I will have to.

645
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,837
No stupid animal
is going to make me leave my land.

646
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,878
I'll go to Carson City,
get some blasting powder.

647
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,428
Juan, we were lucky. Dumb lucky.

648
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:43,992
If a man like Black Hand Kelly is no match
for them, what chance do we have?

649
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:49,074
Pyong, why would you stay? Take
Fu Yien and the missis back to China.

650
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,235
Lu Wan forgets.

651
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,677
China not perfect. No place perfect.

652
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,312
We will not leave our new home.

653
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:21,194
I'll send for my belongings, and see that
the horse and equipment are returned.

654
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,158
That won't be necessary.
You can keep the horse,

655
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,994
and the saddle and the rifle
and the knife.

656
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,072
In trade for ownership of the mine.

657
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:35,119
- You can't be serious.
- It's the best offer you're gonna get.

658
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,352
When I reach Philadelphia, I intend
to sell that mine for at least $50,000.

659
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,113
You will be preceded by a telegram
to the newspapers

660
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:49,116
describing in detail the creatures plaguing
the mine, and why it is unworkable.

661
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,679
That's blackmail.
You wouldn't betray me like that.

662
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,035
We voted.

663
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,395
Four to one in favor
of doing exactly that.

664
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,677
At least one of you
has some sense of ethics.

665
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,479
I voted to drop you off a cliff.

666
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,276
Stay with us, Hiram. Stay and fight.

667
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,399
You're wasting your lives.

668
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,918
You can have the cursed mine.

669
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,359
Whoa. Whoa.

670
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,755
Mr. Gummer, please don't leave us.

671
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,476
Fu...

672
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,120
Fu Yien, I can't help you.

673
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,672
<i>¡Madre de Dios.</i> Hyah! Hyah!

674
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,150
We were wrong. They're coming.

675
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,595
The dirt dragons, they got through
the upper valley pass.

676
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,592
I don't know when,
but they are definitely coming.

677
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,875
Maybe they not find us, keep going south.

678
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,349
No, no, no, no. They hunt by sound.

679
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,115
We are the only thing making noise
between here and Carson City.

680
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,634
What do the sticks say?

681
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,392
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

682
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,631
"Expect a ferocious arrival."

683
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,311
Well, this is it, then.

684
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,634
The end of Rejection.

685
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,877
<i>(train whistle)</i>

686
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:59,230
One ticket for your next train
to Philadelphia. Sleeping car.

687
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,232
- One way.
- Yes, sir.

688
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,311
<i>(Morse code)</i>

689
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,392
Fools.

690
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,916
- I beg your pardon?
- The people up in Rejection.

691
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,596
Funnier than a dancing bear, eh?
Here's one they sent yesterday.

692
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,797
"Giant worms have left upper valley."

693
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,189
- "May find town."
- May I?

694
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:30,035
"Need immediate help."
<i>(laughs)</i> "Giant worms."

695
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,790
One ticket.

696
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,438
Sir? Your ticket?

697
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:22,998
I was thinkin' I could make a sled for it.
We could pull it behind the last wagon.

698
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,071
There's no room.

699
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,348
Time to let it go.

700
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,037
Juan, where will you go?

701
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:47,434
There is a new strike down near Tonopah.
I'm thinking of heading that way.

702
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,114
Where will we go?

703
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,751
- We are going to San Francisco.
- And then back to China.

704
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,639
All our money is put in the store,
and now it's all gone.

705
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,953
And you are not going to work on
the railroad like momma and poppa.

706
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,989
They're coming!

707
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:19,112
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

708
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:23,113
They will come from the north,
not from the south.

709
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,670
That is something else... or someone.

710
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,114
What poor soul
would be coming here now?

711
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,633
It's Mr. Gummer!

712
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,596
Come on! Whoa!

713
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,032
"A ferocious arrival"?

714
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:23,553
Well, now, maybe I'll
let you keep him after all.

715
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:28,998
Stop! Whoa, curse you! Whoa! Whoa!

716
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:32,154
Whoa, you intransigent beasts!

717
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,915
- Delighted to see you're all well.
- Hiram, they could be here any minute!

718
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,956
- I know.
- Whatever are you thinking?

719
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:43,637
That this idyllic Western retreat shall not
fall prey to these mindless predators.

720
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:50,273
I have a cache of weapons that would
impress even the late Black Hand Kelly.

721
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:54,273
One Sharps.52-calibre buffalo rifle.

722
01:12:55,160 --> 01:13:00,154
One Remington 45-120 Rolling Block.

723
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:06,918
One Henry repeating rifle. Smaller caliber,
but impressive rate of fire.

724
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:10,758
One eight-gauge Remington... um...

725
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:12,989
derringer.

726
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:18,632
One LC Smith ten-gauge
stub twist coach gun.

727
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,439
And this.

728
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,115
A two-inch-bore punt gun.

729
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,398
Hiram, how did you get all of these
things? You don't have any money.

730
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:41,999
A wise friend once told me it's not
important how you spend your money,

731
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,958
but how you spend your life.

732
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:50,151
Hiram Gummer, what is it
you think we are going to do? Hm?

733
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:56,634
Madam, I intend we throw our visitors
a little corpse-and-cartridge occasion.

734
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:02,834
That we stand our ground and
fight these despicable beasts to the death!

735
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,952
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

736
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,634
We will fight!

737
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,199
Right.

738
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,748
<i>(both speak Chinese)</i>

739
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:22,439
It takes me two years to make you
leave China. You think I want to go back?

740
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,590
- We do it.
- We'll stomp 'em like snakes.

741
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,069
- We will burn them down.
- We'll smoke 'em up!

742
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:32,511
Ah, Juan. Knowing you,
you'll need a spare.

743
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,710
<i>Gracias, amigo.</i>

744
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,550
They'll probably be coming
from the north or the northeast.

745
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,756
Then we go out there and shoot them.

746
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,798
Too dangerous.
They can come up anywhere.

747
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,871
We dare not face them on their terms.

748
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,475
- Stake a horse. When they go for it...
- Tecopa, that's cruel.

749
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,677
Well, these are cruel times.

750
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,070
Can't we make noise
with something else?

751
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:07,392
That is a good idea, Fuito.
Any noise works.

752
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,678
It doesn't have to be a horse. We could
make noise on something like this.

753
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,320
Then when they come up, we shoot them.

754
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:18,109
Yes, an ambush. We will
lead them into our very gun muzzles.

755
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:22,239
We will make Rejection our last bastion,
our last line of defense.

756
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:26,393
- Our Alamo.
- Juan, we were the losers at the Alamo.

757
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,278
Speak for yourself, gringo.

758
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,551
More cans. I need more cans.

759
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,950
- I'm eating as fast as I can.
<i>- (speaks Chinese)</i>

760
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,674
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>
What is all this?

761
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,958
When they come, how do we know
they come? We cannot see them.

762
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:56,397
- Well, that is a concern.
- When the ground shakes...

763
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,074
we know they are here.

764
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,069
Dandy.

765
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,031
What is a punt gun?

766
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:15,193
Something to do with shooting ducks.
A great many ducks.

767
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,909
"Pour in one pound of shot or balls.
Ram it down tight..."

768
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,991
Yup! Hyah!

769
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:35,312
Won't we need the horses?
I mean, if we lose the fight?

770
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:39,598
Can't have them making
unnecessary noise. Might spoil our trap.

771
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:42,194
And we're not going to lose, Fuito.

772
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,308
Shall we begin?

773
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,715
Maybe we should try again tomorrow.

774
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:53,715
Perhaps Pyong was right. Perhaps
they've bypassed us for Carson City.

775
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,518
I don't know.

776
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:59,673
The ridge at the south end of the valley
is all rock, like a big wall.

777
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:04,117
- I don't think they can get past it.
- They gotta be somewhere.

778
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,236
<i>(jangling)</i>

779
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:18,633
- No! Fu, get inside!
<i>- (speaks Chinese)</i>

780
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:22,429
- But I want to fight too!
- Fu, Fu.

781
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:27,992
The store is our fort.
We can't ever leave the fort unguarded.

782
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,709
You stay inside and keep guard.

783
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,911
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

784
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,829
You missed! With a cannon!

785
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:09,189
- Where did it go?
- Maybe the noise scared him away.

786
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,798
Mr. Gummer, it's coming!
It's coming back!

787
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:23,752
Hiram, quick!

788
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,912
- Yeah!
<i>- (all cheer)</i>

789
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,756
It worked!

790
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:12,875
Ugh!

791
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,279
It stinks!

01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,911
Fu Yien, back inside!

795
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,272
Juan!

796
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,197
Did it do that on purpose?

01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,520
- But not as smart as us.
- No.

809
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,717
Not as smart as us.
And there's only one left.

Let it show itself!

No, it's circling. Listening for prey.

What do we do?

817
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,078
It seems our rifles
aren't strong enough to kill it.

- Without the punt gun, I fear we're lost.
<i>- (speaks Chinese)</i>

819
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:59,279
So we just stop the fight, then? Give up?

Maybe we take traction engine.
Try to get away.

821
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,150
- It moves so slowly.
- And you would leave our town?

- You have ideas for killing it?

A man must learn to sail in all winds.

824

Well said.

01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:27,035
You have black powder.
Maybe we could blow it up somehow.

828
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,954
Sure. We make big firecracker.
I know how.

829
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:35,670
Excellent - but quietly.
Move very, very slowly.

Fu Yien, you go inside
and get twine for fuse.

OK.

01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:58,794

Almost there. Just another few minutes.

01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,672
Why doesn't it come for us?
For the noise?

841
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,752
I don't know.
They keep learning our every trick.

842
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,308
He's over here.

843
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:12,674
Fu!

844
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,159
Good boy. Good boy.

845
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,231
<i>(roaring)</i>

846
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,754
Hurry up. The wagon! In the wagon!

847
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,149
Get on.

848
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,669
- Oh, good Lord!
- Let's get the rifles.

849
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,311
The bomb!

850
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,592
- Pyong, you must finish the bomb.
- I need more time!

851
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:02,235
We'll never have time to finish that!

852
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,870
I have an idea.

853
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,911
<i>¡Hijo de puta!</i>

854
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,068
Pyong, that big belt.

855
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:32,988
Excellent, excellent.
Tecopa! Help us here!

856
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:38,435
- What we need is some kind of hook.
- I know where.

857
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,238
Over here, Juan!

858
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,193
Go.

859
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:15,995
Go!

860
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,153
<i>(roars)</i>

861
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,953
<i>(Gummer)</i> Watch out!

862
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:45,073
Yes!

863
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,637
- Mrs. Lord, are you well?
- Yes. Are you all right?

864
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,233
Yes, I am.

865
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,358
<i>Gracias, amiguito.</i>

866
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,958
- You got 'em, Mr. Gummer.
- Yes, Hiram. You got 'em.

867
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:36,156
No, no.

868
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:37,639
<i>We</i> got 'em.

869
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,430
Well done, well done.

870
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,511
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

871
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:56,948
Hiram!

872
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:01,989
The bank has approved your loan. You
can hire new workers, reopen the mine.

873
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:05,755
Well, if I recall,
it no longer belongs to me.

874
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:11,117
It's yours, Hiram. It's your mine.

875
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,395
We couldn't cheat you that way.

876
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,914
You need it worse than we do.

877
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,549
That's very kind. But I'll only
assume ownership under two conditions.

878
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:20,959
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

879
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,758
"Conditions"?

880
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:27,516
We agree never to tell anyone
about the dirt dragons.

881
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,354
If word of them ever got out,
no one would ever settle here.

882
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,352
And the second condition?

883
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,795
That the first proceeds of the mine
are used

884
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:41,431
to build a hotel
and a market with real walls,

885
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,398
to pay off Juan's land, and, uh...

886
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,548
Tecopa, what do you want?

887
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:53,151
A new statue.

888
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,276
One that looks like me.

889
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,557
And to commission a statue for Tecopa.

890
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,995
Does everyone agree to this?

891
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,715
I am fearfully outclassed.

892
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,995
It's good you've decided to stay.

893
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:42,278
I shall personally supervise the mine - I
mean, as soon as I learn how it all works.

894
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,397
And I've selected
an excellent location for my home.

895
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:49,678
On high ground. Readily defended.
It will even have a basement.

896
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,751
That's a lot of room for one person.

897
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,799
Ideally, it... won't be for just one.

898
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:07,514
- Oh, I really am hopeless.
- You'll get better with a little practice.

899
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:12,913
In the meantime I bought something that
might aid in your success as a marksman.

900
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,831
Dandy.

901
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,191
Hiram?

902
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:40,478
<i>(he laughs and cheers)</i>

903
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,189
<i>(he laughs maniacally)</i>
