few minutes in peace.

1171
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:00,240
All right. If you wanna go ahead and die
like some chickenshit loser, then just do it!

1172
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,520
- Die, for Christ's sake!
- I'm tryin' to, if you'd just shut up.

[GROANING]

1174
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,920
Charlie? Charlie, look.
You forgot something.

1175
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,080
The loot. The money.

1176
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,080
Come here, Duchess.
Close to me.

1177
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,640
I want to feel both of you.

1178
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,400
Lived a lot of years...

1179
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,680
lots of tight spots...

1180
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:32,560
but I always talked
or kissed my way out of' em.

1181
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:34,520
I know, Charlie. You told me.

1182
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,440
I was gettin' into
a tight spot with you.

1183
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,120
I was gonna ask you to marry me.

1184
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,760
Well, I sure as hell found a way out.

1185
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,960
Duchess. Duchess.

1186
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,880
Yeah?

1187
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:54,320
How many times you been in love?

1188
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,920
- Includin' this time?
- Mm-hmm.

1189
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,880
Once.

1190
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:03,720
Sure charmed the ass right off you,
Duchess. You know what I mean?

1191
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,280
I know what you mean.

1192
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:11,200
What a way to go--
rich and charming.

1193
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:16,240
[GROANING]

1194
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:20,880
You may go charming, Malloy,
but you'll never go rich.

1195
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,800
[GROANING] What the hell
are you talking about?

1196
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,504
Just that you've blown
the big one, Malloy.

1197
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:26,440
Stop, for God's sake!

1198
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,640
- And I'm gonna have myself a time.
- Wait. That's still my money.

1199
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,280
- Not yours. Mine. You're dead.
- Oh, wait! Wait!

1200
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,120
What for?
You just told me I could go.

1201
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:38,040
I was hysterical.
That-That's $40,000.

1202
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:41,880
And it's all mine. I'm gonna knock
Salt Lake City ass over tin cup.

1203
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:45,880
You dirty, two-bit hustler!
Come back here! That's my money!

1204
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,640
Get up off your two bowlegged
pins if you want it and come get it.

1205
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:52,760
I can't walk! I got a bullet
in my chest, a bullet in my arm...

1206
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,320
and you're giving me
one pain in the ass!

1207
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,360
Stop! You hear me?

1208
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,640
- And them I'm gonna get on a boat--
- You cheap hooker!

1209
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,680
<i>Come on!
Get up,you lazy bum!</i>

1210
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,960
<i>Get up on your two feet
and come and get it!</i>

1211
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,520
<i>Come on,you good-for-nothing!
Get up!</i>

1212
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:10,440
<i>Come on! Give me my money!
You nickel hooker!</i>

1213
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,140
That's my money!

1214
01:37:11,166 --> 01:37:13,185
It's my money now! I'm
gonna have myself...
