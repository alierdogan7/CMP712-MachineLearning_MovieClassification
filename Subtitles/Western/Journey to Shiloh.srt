27
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,754
Any of you boys want some more?
You just keep coming.

28
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,196
There he is.
Let's go get him.

29
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,445
Get up. Get up.

30
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,091
Come on, Buck!

31
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,400
I bet they'll never let us
in that town again.

32
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,670
I don't know, it looks like
they handled us pretty good.

33
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,972
- ls that so?
- You Concho County boys maybe.

34
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,341
Not old J.C.

35
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,469
J.C., they want to split
your head wide open.

36
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,946
- I ain't finish with them.
- Sure you are.

37
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,108
- We got riding to do.
- I'm riding...

38
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,042
right back to Dallas.

39
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,519
Pretty good with bottles,
let's see how they are with guns.

40
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,622
- Let it go, J.C.
- I don't let nothing go.

41
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,854
- You're too damn touchy, J.C.
- Don't tell me what I am.

42
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,585
You ain't going back.

43
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:08,229
I said I am.
You gonna try and stop me?

44
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,342
Well, you know, I...

45
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,903
l can't match you
gun for gun, J.C.

46
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,213
You better believe it.

47
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,409
And I said l'm going.
Anybody arguing?

48
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,913
Well...

49
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,288
have it your way.

50
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,294
J.C. is stubborn as critter.

51
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,462
Get him on his horse.

52
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,207
He's gonna be mean
when he wakes up, Buck.

53
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,802
You all made me captain.
Didn't much want the job.

54
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:55,347
Now I gotta give the orders
he knew that when he wanted to join up.

55
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,373
I doubt he ever believed.

56
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,416
The man took an oath.
Let's go.

57
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,749
J.C., I told you we had
riding to do.

58
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,247
I know what you told me.

59
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,416
You hit me
when I wasn't looking.

60
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,391
There was no other way.

61
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,452
I ain't forgetting it, Buck.

62
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,463
- You mind that.
- Well, minded.

63
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,761
Nobody sneak-hits J.C. Sutton.

64
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,063
Suit yourself, J.C. Sutton.

65
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,438
Willie Bill.

66
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,474
How far you reckon
we made today?

67
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,338
I don't know. 35, 40 miles.

68
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,115
Ain't enough. We'll be all summer
to get to Richmond.

69
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,351
Yeah, by the time we get there,
there'll be no war.

70
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,616
Yeah, I’ve been thinking about that.

71
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,253
But now, we better get some sleep.

72
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,415
Buck?

73
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,258
- You remember what I said.
- Oh, yeah.

74
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,260
I’ll toss and turn over it
all night.

75
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,441
Bean and jerky.
There ain't nothing better.

76
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,744
Seen how we ain't eating anything else
since we left home...

77
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,610
you're a lot easy to please,
Little Bit.

78
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,244
Somebody coming.

79
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,427
What are you doing
on our lands?

80
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,930
- This here is your land?
- You're right here in the middle of it.

81
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,432
Don't tell!
Nice land.

82
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,095
- Suits me fine.
- You're trespassing.

83
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,371
Well, it doesn't seem
like we're hurting none.

84
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,308
Maybe you think we are.
Maybe you'd like to throw us off.

85
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,676
- J.C.
- Never mind.

86
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,511
I wanna see these stooges
throw us off.

87
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,777
Now nobody said anything
about throwing anybody off, did they?

88
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,350
As long as you're just camping,
l guess you're not hurting anything.

89
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,581
That's right, friendly.
Thank you.

90
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,617
Step down, have a bean.

91
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:57,329
- What's that you are eating?
- Beans and jerky.

92
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,930
That's real frontier food.

93
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,899
That's where we brought it from.
Concho County.

94
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,002
Concho County?
That's at the other side of Pecos.

95
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,301
There's still Indians out there.

96
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,306
None that we left alive, there is.

97
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,275
We're the Concho County Comanche's.

98
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,409
We're on our way to Richmond, Virginia.

99
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,345
We're gonna join the
General Hood Texas' Brigade.

100
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,347
- ls that right?
- This here is Buck Burnett...

101
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,679
he's our Capitain.

102
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,818
Boy, l'm proud to know you, captain.
I'm Carter Claiborne.

103
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:23,254
- This is my brother, Custis.
- Glad to know you.

104
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,323
- You're really going to Virginia?
- That's right.

105
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,859
We heard ourselves that General Hood
needs himself some good horse soldiers.

106
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,861
Yeah, we reckon
we're the best there's.

107
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,662
We're just afraid they're gonna ran
out of Yankees before we get there.

108
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,666
Boy, all the way to Richmond.

109
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,502
- Gee, wish I could do that.
- Why don't you come along with us?

110
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:38,765
We got plenty of room.

111
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,139
- You mean it?
- Sure!

112
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,374
We got room, ain't we, Buck?

113
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,843
We ain't talking about
recruiting anybody, but...

114
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,978
- You got guns?
- Of course we got guns.

115
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,346
- Know how to use them too.
- What would your folks say?

116
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,479
- We'll talk to them tonight.
- Yeah.

117
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:58,084
Captain Burnett.
You wanna come to a party?

118
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,693
- What kind of party?
- It's what they call a cotillion.

119
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,961
At our place.

120
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,630
And our cousin Airybelle,
she's from Alabama.

121
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,833
There'll be dancing, bourbon punch,
food and everything.

122
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,301
You gotta come.

123
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,237
Maybe be there when
we talk to our folks.

124
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,570
This cousin Airybelle of yours,
is she pretty?

125
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,475
She's the prettiest thing
you ever saw.

126
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,274
- Well now!
- I don't know, fellas. I mean...

127
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,347
Sounds kind of fancy for us.

128
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,516
Come on, general.
We've been invited to a party.

129
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,784
We're camping here
tonight anyway.

130
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,786
- Ain't no harm in going.
- He's right, Buck.

131
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,355
Come on, Buck. There ain't
no harm on looking at a pretty girl.

132
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,690
We'd be glad to have you.

133
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,625
Sure! With you going
to war and everything.

134
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,660
Pop will probably make you
the honor guest.

135
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,062
Come on, Buck.
It would do us good.

136
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,325
Oh, yeah.

137
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,932
Well, I guess we can scrabble up
in that cranky younger.

138
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,301
- No reason we can't go.
- Now you're talking, Buck.

139
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,804
Now listen, you tell them to stand by,
'cause the Concho County Comanche's...

140
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,171
are gonna show them how
to threw a party, right, Miller?

141
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,368
Get you boys!

142
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,973
Help! Help!

143
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,291
My goodness!

144
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,726
If you, young gentlemen,
ain't a sight?

145
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,926
- ls there something wrong?
- Nothing.

146
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,901
We've never seen
one of you before.

147
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,471
Well, there's a wisp
of us around.

148
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,240
- Not where we come from.
- Where is that, gentlemen?

149
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,175
Concho County, well western here.

150
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,845
My, my.
You're a long way from home.

151
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,847
We're going to be longer.
We're headed for Virginia.

152
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,315
Ain't that nice?

153
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,451
You know, where the war is.
We're going to fight Yankees.

154
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,453
I hear tell the Yankees
is fighting us.

155
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,355
I hear tell they're mighty mean!

156
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,491
Oh, I reckon we'll whip them, though.

157
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,393
- We?
- Yes, sir. Us Southerners.

158
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,129
- You live here?
- Yes, sir.

159
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,400
I run the cottage for Colonel Claiborne.

160
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,598
Buck?
Their house must be a mile.

161
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,408
I’ve never seen a slave before.
Isn’t that something?

162
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,210
We're just folks, sir.

163
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,046
The only difference is that
we belong to Colonel Claiborne.

164
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,844
He's a magnify gentleman.

165
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,753
- Claiborne house is down this way?
- Yes, sir.

166
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:12,349
Right on that road, you might.
You're all going to the party?

167
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,125
Yeah, we sure are.

168
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,789
Well, I hope you have a real good time.
And good luck with them Yankees.

169
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,726
Yeah, thank you.

170
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,661
Let's go.

171
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,336
So long.

172
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,973
- Never seen anything like this.
- Hear what he said "us Southerners"?

173
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:39,517
What do you suppose he meant by that?

174
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,686
Well, he lives here, don't he?
Sure ain't Northerner.

175
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:46,886
- Buck, something don't make sense.
- Yeah, I aim to found out what it is.

176
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,629
Look at that!

177
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,347
Are we suppose to get in there?

178
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,749
- Maybe this ain't the place, huh, Buck?
- It's the place alright.

179
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,954
- Are we going in?
- We've invited, ain't we?

180
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,355
J.C. is right.

181
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,891
We've been invited,
it wouldn't be fitted if we didn't go.

182
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,160
- I rather take a walk.
- Oh, come on!

183
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,461
We're as good as they are!

184
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,064
Besides, I wanna give myself
a good look at cousin Airybelle.

185
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,555
Come on, Buck. Let's go.

186
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,294
Yeah.

187
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,759
- Yes, gentlemen?
- It's all right, Benjamin.

188
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,890
- These are my friends.
- Very well, Mr. Carter.

189
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,603
Come on!
They'll take your horses.

190
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,080
- All these darks are yours?
- We own a couple hundred of them.

191
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,287
- They don't give you any trouble?
- Why would they give us any trouble?

192
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:26,424
- Just figures.
- No. This is their home.

193
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,622
- Don't you have any nigers?
- All we got is Indians.

194
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,897
They surely aren't the same.
When the Yankees talk about slaves...

195
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,166
you think we keep them in chains
and beat them twice a day.

196
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,464
It isn't like that.

197
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:41,103
- Well, we've got a lot to learn.
- Come on, it's already starting.

198
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,468
Well, Carter, I don't know.

199
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,415
You see the people go in there...

200
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,680
they're dressed with shirts and all.

201
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,485
Look at us.

202
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,855
But you're soldiers! You're not
suppose to look like civilians.

203
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,557
You know, he's got
a point there, Buck.

204
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,358
We've come this far. It would be
a shame not to go the rest of the way.

205
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:03,989
Well...

206
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,394
l thought a captain
was suppose to lead.

207
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,165
All right, let's go.

208
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:33,491
Ladies and gentlemen,
Captain Buck Burnett.

209
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,756
And the Concho County Comanche's.

210
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,291
Somebody get them out of here!

211
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,071
Pop, they're soldiers.
They're going to the war.

212
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,339
Get them out of here, Edward!

213
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,442
Outside, gentlemen.
Quickly now, outside.

214
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,012
- Outside.
- Pa, I invited them. They're soldiers.

215
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,647
They're savages!
They don't belong here.

216
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,317
- I invited them.
- I'm throwing them out.

217
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,853
Now you get upstairs,
fall of how old you are...

218
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,651
and take a staff to you!

219
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:07,323
These gentlemen are not to be
allowed in the house again.

220
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:12,363
- That ain't no way to treat soldiers.
- To think we're going to fight for them.

221
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,527
- There's a war going on, ain't there?
- Come on, let's get out of here.

222
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:21,095
Gentlemen, please.
Don't go.

223
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,910
Please, Captain Burnett.
Don't go.

224
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,441
If anyone belongs here, you do.

225
00:17:30,243 --> 00:17:32,283
The folks here in Texas
just don't feel the world...

226
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,911
the way we do in Alabama.

227
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,789
Their behavior towards you
is inexcusable.

228
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,861
Well, ma'am, I guess
you can't much blame them.

229
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,934
We're not really dressed for a party.

230
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,474
But you soldiers are the Confederacy.

231
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:00,434
You're going after to fight their war.
I'm ashamed of them.

232
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,980
And l'm ashamed of myself
for standing by and saying nothing.

233
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,247
As an Alabama patriot,
l implore you, go back inside.

234
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,388
I don't think we'll do that, ma'am.

235
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,849
A man can get bit once
by a rattler by accident...

236
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,626
if he gets bit twice, well,
that's just being stupid.

237
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,799
Then please accept my apology...

238
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,269
and my gratitude for the brave
and noble thing you're doing.

239
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,864
I mean that from
the bottom of my heart.

240
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,345
Ma'am, we don't know much
about this here war, but...

241
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,681
as long as there are ladies like you
supporting it the way you do...

242
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,048
l'm sure the south
can't help but win.

243
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,615
We'll remember what you said
when we get to war.

244
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,755
It’ll help us from being tired.

245
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,223
Yes, ma'am.

246
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,392
May God bless you
and keep you. Everyone.

247
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,328
Yes, ma'am.

248
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:28,232
Well, I’ll tell you boys. I'm in love.
My heart is plumbed on.

249
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,701
Airybelle. Airybelle.

250
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,735
- What do you think, Buck?
- About what?

251
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,553
Them Claiborne boys. Do you reckon
they're going to join up with us?

252
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,369
I wouldn't bet my money on it, Miller.
Seen that house? What they got?

253
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,649
I figure if you're rich enough...

254
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,982
maybe you don't feel so much
like fighting the war.

255
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,420
Some people may find it tough to...

256
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,389
give up everything they've got
for beans and jerky.

257
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,221
They're Southerners, ain't they?

258
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,150
Maybe that ain't enough.
Just been Southerners.

259
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,225
All right, let's go.
Let's shake this dust.

260
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:04,391
We'll get someplace where
they feel more kind about the war.

261
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,234
All right, head them out.

262
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,737
Well, good as the finest house
l ever did see.

263
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:50,071
- At least we're in Louisiana, huh?
- Near as out of Texas.

264
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,811
I'm getting six feet ahead
and sleeping for a week.

265
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,548
- Not me. I’ve got plans.
- We all got plans, J.C.

266
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,074
You've got yours and I’ve got mine.

267
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,777
Well, boys, we've got us a problem.

268
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,523
The stock is pretty sad.

269
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,960
Little Bit, the bushes came out,
your horse's is feel with pastern.

270
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,663
It wouldn't be riding a saddle
for a whole week.

271
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,266
If we're gonna get to Richmond
while there's still a war on...

272
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,400
we'll have to do something.

273
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,369
- I’ve been thinking.
- The General has been thinking.

274
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,395
We've got nothing to worry about!

275
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,806
Well, I’ll go to Shreveport
first thing in the morning...

276
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,678
find us a dealer.

277
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,447
Sell them all our stock and gear...

278
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,083
buy us a ticket to
the next stage to Vicksburg.

279
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,518
We've got a couple of hours to spare,
we're gonna have to take a vote on it.

280
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,316
Ain't nobody selling my horse.

281
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,191
- He goes with me.
- What do you mean he goes with you?

282
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,921
I mean l'm moving on.

283
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,319
I'm tired of you toy soldiers.

284
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,298
You can't do that, J.C.
You took an oath.

285
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,266
Yeah, to the Concho
County Comanche's.

286
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,568
Well, l'm from Miner County.

287
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,594
And I don't like the way
things have worked out.

288
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,272
You treat us like we're
a bunch of school kids!

289
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,935
Well, l'm a man and
l do things my way.

290
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,038
- I ain't gonna let you go.
- You think you can stop me?

291
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,907
Any of you?

292
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,418
- Come on and try.
- Now you settled down.

293
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,909
I'm settling out.

294
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:11,021
I’ve come along to fight
and as far as I concern...

295
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,649
the fighting can start right now.

296
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,192
That way, huh?

297
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,421
Now get your hands out
of those ponchos.

298
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:20,087
All of you. Come on.
I wanna see them.

299
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,931
Willie Bill!

300
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,567
You better drop that knife.

301
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,769
You're all pretty sneaky, aren't you?

302
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,945
From now on, I write the rules.
Now come on, hands up. All of you.

303
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,548
-J.C...

304
00:23:39,573 --> 00:23:40,573
-You shut up...

305
00:23:41,374 --> 00:23:42,711
or l'm gonna blow your belly out.

306
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,246
Now move!

307
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,327
Maybe you think
I’ve forgotten, Buck?

308
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,760
Way you cold-cocked me
when I wasn't looking.

309
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,464
But I ain't!

310
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,804
Little Bit, flap him over
and give me out 50 dollars.

311
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,273
I can't do that, J.C.
We took an oath.

312
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,265
Give me that money!

313
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,178
Just fifty. I'm only taking
what I think my share is.

314
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,723
Any of you, chickens,
got any objections?

315
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,724
Adios, soldados.

316
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,341
Them Miner County boys
sure are a crazy bunch.

317
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,071
He took a good one.

318
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:43,247
- You all right, Buck?
- I'm all right.

319
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,273
J.C. said he would get me.

320
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,184
He sure did.

321
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:50,721
- What are you gonna do now, Buck?
- I’ll go get him.

322
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,747
He was boilin', Buck.
He'll be trouble.

323
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,355
That's desertion.

324
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,528
- Can't allow it.
- Let him be, Buck.

325
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,463
He only took the fifty dollars
that was his.

326
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,523
- We're better off without him.
- Nope.

327
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:04,969
He's a lot touchy, but think what
a good soldier he would make...

328
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,528
- for General Hood.
- Miller.

329
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,642
You're the captain while l'm gone.

330
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,479
Take the horses and gear into town...

331
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,414
and get the best price.

332
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,717
- Sure thing, Buck.
- Wait for me at the stage depo.

333
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:25,284
He's might previous with that
gun of his, Buck. You watch him.

334
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,257
Yeah, I know it.

335
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,494
If it should happen l'm not there
in time, you leave without me.

336
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:31,762
That's an order.

337
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,926
- Remind what I said, Miller.
- I’ll do it, Buck.

338
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,458
- Good luck with J.C.
- Yeah.

339
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:18,534
Give me two.

340
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,239
Two.

341
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:38,956
Show or bet.

342
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,805
The bet is twenty.

343
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,408
That's a sucker bet, J.C.

344
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,911
Maybe I didn't hit you
hard enough.

345
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,403
How do you figure
that's a sucker bet, Texas?

346
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:00,284
You're bucking too many hands.
I guess.

347
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:03,218
Blow away, general.
Your bet.

348
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,416
Is too rich for me.

349
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,019
Well, I’ll tell you what...

350
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:15,221
since you're busted,
I’ll take it easy on you.

351
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,060
You do that.

352
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,063
I call you, friend.

353
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,633
I call.

354
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,868
I would say is a rig.
No, thank you, ma'am.

355
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,610
Did you say something, cowboy?

356
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,915
Well, my friend is
dried that bottle and...

357
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,545
- I don't think he should be playing.
- That's his problem, not yours.

358
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,189
All right, friend. I called.

359
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,961
Queens. Four.

360
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,125
No good.

361
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,261
I’ve got a straight flush.

362
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,403
In Diamonds.

363
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,442
How many tens diamonds
there is in this game?

364
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,085
All right.

365
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,687
On the table.

366
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,355
Buck! Buck.

367
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,425
It hurts.

368
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,208
I know he came
with fifty dollars in here.

369
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,438
Sal.

370
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,319
Wait.

371
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:52,286
- Now take thirty coins for yourself.
- For me? Why?

372
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,761
Look it up in the Bible, lady.

373
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,491
Thirty pieces of silver,
that's what the job pays.

374
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,294
Well, go ahead.

375
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:08,545
Anybody who wanna follow me outside
and take back what they think is his...

376
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,547
- is welcome.
- It's all right, cowboy.

377
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:13,540
You're going out clean.
Just keep going.

378
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,753
What's going on here?

379
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,926
A bunch of thieves
robbed my friend...

380
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,690
and killed him
when he didn't like it.

381
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,298
Sonny, we don't like Texas
coming into our town...

382
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,893
and making loose charges.
Now you give me that gun.

383
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,471
That way, huh?

384
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,871
All right.

385
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,208
Here's fifty dollars.

386
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,317
That oughta be enough
to bury my friend.

387
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,377
You take care of that, sheriff.

388
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,119
I don't expect you would
have that decency.

389
00:29:52,485 --> 00:29:55,325
- You give me that gun, boy.
- You come any closer, you'll get this gun.

390
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,226
Now back off.

391
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,371
Everybody stay in pack.

392
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:05,861
- Buck!
- Buck!

393
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,396
- How are you, Buck?
- Thank goodness, Buck!

394
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,859
Get back or you'll lose
the schedule.

395
00:31:11,097 --> 00:31:13,537
- How did you got out, Buck?
- Shot was faster than they shot.

396
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,805
Where are your horse and gear?

397
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,899
- Let in some farm.
- Hurry up.

398
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,108
Way to go.

399
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,314
Colonel, this is Buck Burnett.
He's our captain.

400
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,482
Colonel Cooney, Buck Burnett.

401
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,918
- Howdy.
- Nice to know you, Colonel.

402
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,989
- You a real Colonel?
- That's a honorary title, son.

403
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,457
Purely honorary.

404
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,825
I reckon you all will meet up
with the real one soon enough.

405
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,196
Buck, we heard about J.C.

406
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,097
- Hell of a note!
- Yeah.

407
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:45,469
I guess he was born
to die that way.

408
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:50,430
So, you're all gonna join
the heroic forces of the stars and bars?

409
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,334
The South needs every man
she can get.

410
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,714
If only I were twenty years younger...
Ten years!

411
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:01,014
- I reckon you would...
- It's a noble thing.

412
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,848
I only wish that more people
felt about it the way you do.

413
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:09,259
- Now you take Shreveport.
- A den of iniquity, son.

414
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,794
A den of iniquity.

415
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:14,798
And I can assure you that it's
not representative of the Confederacy.

416
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,736
We're a united nation engaged
in a holly crusade.

417
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:53,463
- Howdy, Case.
- Howdy, Colonel.

418
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,039
How many you
running down today, Case?

419
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,474
Just one big buck
took out this morning.

420
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:03,643
Case Pettibone here is a oversee
of old General Cannes Furton.

421
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,416
No niger is gonna run away
from old Case.

422
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:10,376
- Runaway, huh?
- Well, not for long, son.

423
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,690
- You got the dogs out, Case?
- Yep.

424
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,526
Ben Swayze expects too likely
you'll hear them open up...

425
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:20,019
- before you get to Munroe.
- That would be something to hear!

426
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:23,967
If you see that buck, general,
fire off a couple of shots.

427
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,069
- That should do it.
- We'll do it, Case.

428
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,437
We'll do it.

429
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:28,735
Get out of here!

430
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,680
Why you suppose he ran away?

431
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,946
You run into a bad one
every now and then.

432
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:43,854
Tries to get across the river
into Texas, but...

433
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,290
but they don't stand a chance
with old Case after them.

434
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,691
That Pettibone looks awful mean.

435
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:54,597
You don't run a hundred field
for been friendly, sonny.

436
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:05,601
That's Ben Sawyze's Redbone
running full bell on a hot track.

437
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,775
Stop! Please!

438
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:15,509
Please, stop!
Please, help me, mister!

439
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,084
Help me!

440
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,048
There he is!

441
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:24,661
- Please, help me!
- Get out of there!

442
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,590
Help me! Help me!

443
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,300
That man is scared for his life.
Why ain't the driver stopping?

444
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:34,635
No call to.
The runaway is dog beef for sure!

445
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,308
He'll have him before
he gets timber again.

446
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:41,411
- You watch close now.
- You watch close.

447
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:45,382
Please, mister!
I'm damned. They have hounds.

448
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,442
Hold that before
l blow you in two.

449
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:49,483
Come on, get in here.

450
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,114
Go ahead, get in there.

451
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,386
- Now whip him up!
- Get out there!

452
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,237
Whoa! That Buck is a runaway!

453
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,842
Why don't you try get us with your dogs?
You're losing your chicken gutters?

454
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,585
Driving a stage with a niger!

455
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,315
I understand they don't
bite off, Colonel.

456
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,318
What are we gonna do with him, Buck?

457
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,125
I don't know, but we ain't
giving him back to the dogs.

458
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,653
Now look here, boys.
We're going to Munroe station.

459
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,531
Just happens that the sheriff
there is a friend of mine.

460
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,033
Why don't you let me turn him
over to the sheriff?

461
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:41,538
No, don't do that.
I ran away twice before.

462
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,541
- The sheriff will sure hell kill me.
- The law don't do things like that.

463
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:48,945
Don't worry, boys.
My friend Will take care of everything.

464
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,982
Just calm down, you don't have
a thing to be afraid of.

465
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,184
My God, mister.
You don't understand.

466
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:57,154
- The sheriff is gonna kill me.
- Is that right, Colonel?

467
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:03,059
He's just scared we'll
whip his guts. That's all.

468
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,362
Of course the sheriff will
make an example out of him...

469
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:08,064
get him a lick or two, he got to.

470
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:10,233
Otherwise, they'll all run away.

471
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,636
But the sheriff will see
he gets back to his rightful owner.

472
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,537
That's the law, boys.

473
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,609
This bucky here is worth
over a thousand dollars.

474
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,178
You didn't think we
would let anything happen...

475
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,908
to that amount of money, did you?

476
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,648
Now don't you worry.

477
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,016
You just turn him over to me...

478
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,781
and I’ll see he gets back
to where he belongs.

479
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:34,284
- That's mighty legible, Colonel.
- I'm glad to do it. Glad to do it.

480
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,461
The police station is just
at the other side of Munroe.

481
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,298
Let me go, mister.

482
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:44,935
I'm rested now.
That dogs ain't too close.

483
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:49,270
- Maybe I can make it.
- Won't let you do that, boy.

484
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,943
We've got to turn you to the sheriff,
just like the Colonel said.

485
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,769
Gotta, boy!

486
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,773
I’ve never seen anything likes.
I rather men than dogs.

487
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:06,319
Father Vengeance

488
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,985
Let the poor me

489
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:19,169
Let me hide myself in Thee

490
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,471
Used to sing that song back home.

491
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:24,236
Let the water...

492
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,548
Munroe station sure ain't much.

493
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,484
Buck, I sure hope that runaway
comes out all right.

494
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:38,285
He'll be all right.
The Colonel gave us his word, didn't he?

495
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,891
- He sure was scared.
- He's got nothing to be scared now.

496
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,189
Come on.

497
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,265
Get on now!

498
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,320
What kind of town do you reckon
Vicksburg is going to be, Buck?

499
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,886
A lot better when we get there.

500
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,262
God all mighty, Buck! Look there!

501
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:30,406
It's him.
That runaway slave.

502
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,079
He said they would do it
and they did.

503
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,415
- Buck, you said...
- I know what I said.

504
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,381
- I’ll tell the boys.
- No.

505
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,349
They won't understand this.

506
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:52,954
- We killed him, Buck.
- No, we didn't.

507
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,659
We've done the right thing,
according to the law.

508
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:00,370
- So don't tell them.
- But they oughta know.

509
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,236
Just shut up, Miller.

510
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,778
So this is Vicksburg?

511
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,509
Man! It's really something, isn't it?

512
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:16,344
Well, we've got until morning.
No reason we can't look around.

513
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,979
I’ll give you two dollars each, huh?

514
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,325
I hear there's a street down there
by the river that really lives.

515
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,294
- l'm in for that.
- Me too.

516
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:27,890
- They'll eat you up, Little Bit.
- I'm a Texan, I’ll take some eating.

517
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,529
- What are you gonna do, Buck?
- Look around.

518
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,069
I’ll stick with you.

519
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,138
Ain't sure how much sin
l can do with two dollars...

520
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,403
but l'm willing to find out.
Let's go.

521
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,074
The stage leaves at eight
in the morning. You be there.

522
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,242
Well, where do we start, Buck?

523
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,420
Well, what happened to you?

524
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,421
We met this fellow said
he could get us some girls...

525
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,167
- took our two dollars.
- Would you shut up?

526
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,535
- Never came back, huh?
- No.

527
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:09,072
We should have known better.
You fellows don't look too happy either.

528
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,507
Well, let me tell you something...

529
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,809
when I fellow put one pea
under three shells...

530
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,938
and bet you can't tell which one is
under, you better believe you can't.

531
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,281
Let's find a friendly place.

532
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,978
Yes, saw a lot of people going to
this place across the street.

533
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,428
- Look at all these soldiers!
- That's us, Little Bit...

534
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,158
when we get ourselves
fancy uniforms.

535
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,710
Hey! I bet those buckskins
were hard to get, boy!

536
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:57,772
You reckon at the Confederacy these
folks will wear that to fight, huh?

537
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,450
- Isn't that something, Buck?
- It's something, all right.

538
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,919
- I don't been made sport of.
- He's just funny, Miller.

539
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,656
These boys sure have to scrap
the meat off of their skins...

540
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:07,757
before they put them on.

541
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:12,195
- You smell all over the place.
- Is that right?

542
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,998
We don't want no trouble
with soldiers, Todo.

543
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:18,332
- You tell him, long hair.
- I reckon I just did.

544
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,296
What can I get for you, boys?

545
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,507
Honey, you ain't got no milk in here
for them young.

546
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:27,510
- You job is to serve men.
- Let me go, please.

547
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,445
You heard the lady.
Let her go.

548
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,311
Lady? In here?

549
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:35,084
She may be a female,
but she sure ain't no lady.

550
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:38,521
- She came to take our order.
- You can't buy sugar tits in here, boy.

551
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,257
- Come here, honey.
- Let me out.

552
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,988
You heard the lady, mister.
Let her be.

553
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,121
Well now...

554
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:52,267
this old long hair,
"let her be" he says.

555
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,239
Out, buckskin.

556
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,947
Fight!

557
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,419
You're finally awake.

558
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,925
Feelling any better?

559
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:34,466
- How did I get in here?
- I brought you.

560
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,942
I just figure it would be better
than the Provos getting you.

561
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,110
The way they did to your friends.

562
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:44,881
- Provos?
- Yeah, that's our military police.

563
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:51,044
- What about my friends?
- They caught them, locked them up.

564
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:58,885
- Yeah, I better get them out of there.
- No.

565
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:02,189
You just stay right there.
They'll be let out in the morning.

566
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,328
In time to get your stage
to Richmond.

567
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,101
You sure learned a lot.

568
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:19,238
- I do know how to ask questions.
- How come you brought me here?

569
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:25,210
You stuck up for me, I could
hardly leave you just lying there.

570
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,324
Besides, you called me lady,
that was very nice.

571
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,391
I’ve got some soup here.
Do you want some?

572
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:40,463
- Where are you from?
- New Orleans.

573
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,629
Your folks there?

574
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:49,206
Step daddy. But I forget him
as fast as I can.

575
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,139
Your friends tell me
you're from West Texas?

576
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:56,112
- Yes, ma'am.
- Is your family there?

577
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:00,485
Well, the Indians got them
when I was little.

578
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,750
I’ve been on my own ever since.

579
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,027
We're kind of alike then,
aren't we?

580
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:12,101
I mean, we're both alone, sort of...

581
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,438
Yeah, I guess.

582
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:22,345
Well, I sure wanna thank you
for everything you've done...

583
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:25,281
- but I gotta be going.
- You don't have to go.

584
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,479
Yes, I do.

585
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,719
You gotta a place to sleep?

586
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,119
Well, I sure can't stay here.

587
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,390
Why not?

588
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:47,029
Well, I mean...

589
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,606
no place.

590
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,280
My name is Gabrielle.
Gabrielle DuPrey.

591
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:02,851
- Buck Burnett.
- Yes, I know.

592
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:10,584
- You did say I was nice, didn't you?
- Yes, you were nice to me.

593
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,398
Then let me go on
being nice to you, Buck.

594
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,832
Please.

595
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:22,364
- But you don't really know me.
- I know everything I need to know.

596
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,277
You're decent and gentle...

597
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:36,048
You don't know how long has been
since I met anybody like that.

598
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,283
I want you to stay.

599
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:48,859
I want you to stay so very much.

600
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,898
So much better than
alone in the dark.

601
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:38,107
- What are you doing down there?
- Well, you...

602
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:41,273
you were sleeping
all calm and all.

603
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:46,217
Come on up here.
Come on.

604
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:10,005
- This was scratchy.
- Yeah?

605
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,413
Is that better?

606
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:31,432
- A best girl gave this to you?
- No.

607
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,070
You do have a best girl,
though, don't you?

608
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,542
No.

609
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:45,408
Us Texans ain't much on girls.

610
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,985
We gotta save our strength
and burn up.

611
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,420
And it's not much beauty.

612
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,080
Nothing like you.

613
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:59,919
And all those lndian squad...
Aren't some of them pretty?

614
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:02,597
They're so valuable.

615
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,270
You sure knocked yourself a lot.

616
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,636
- You do know noble, right?
- No.

617
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,811
I was just born natural.

618
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:32,660
Probably when you find your best girl
you give this to her.

619
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,227
I ain't thought much about it.

620
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:41,437
You gotta go to this awful war, huh??

621
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:46,704
Sure, but I tell you...

622
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,510
l ain't so anxious now to get there
as I was yesterday.

623
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:01,181
Don't. No, no.
Don't start that blooding.

624
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,957
I better get dress,
l'm out before for ring tales.

625
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:16,096
And waste my time crying
over some wild man from Texas?

626
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,508
- Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?
- That's me.

627
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:26,115
Buck, would you mind if I came down
to the station to see you off?

628
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:28,277
All right, would take you kindly.

629
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:31,318
Figure...

630
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,415
that will be the last time
l see you, I guess.

631
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:40,127
- Listen, I...
- Yes?

632
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:47,330
Nothing. It's the 8 o'clock east,
you remember that.

633
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,301
I’ll remember, Buck.

634
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:01,884
I'm very good at remembering...
if I want to.

635
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,700
We took by the tail
that Yankee army.

636
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,835
You don't look so surprise, Buck.

637
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,770
I don't know.
He looks pretty good, considering...

638
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:22,872
Considering what...?

639
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,374
Considering that pretty little doll
that dragged you off somewhere.

640
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,510
- Where have you been all night, Buck?
- Not that we have to ask.

641
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,741
I bet they weren't doing
no square dancing.

642
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,481
Never mind.

643
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,780
Maybe that wasn't no ordinary lady.

644
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,815
- Stage is gonna leave on time?
- Yeah. Right on time.

645
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,950
Well, let's load her up.
Come on, move.

646
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:48,928
Buck.

647
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,963
- I was afraid I was gonna miss you.
- Pretty near did.

648
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,642
I brought a going away present.

649
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:06,448
What is this?

650
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:10,414
- Oranges, all the way from Florida.
- Is the firs I ever seen.

651
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:18,257
That's a guarder. Something maybe
a best girl would give you.

652
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,956
Ain't that something?

653
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,428
I’ll write when I get
to where l'm going.

654
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:31,197
I’ll write to you.

655
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,879
I’ll be coming back and...

656
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,247
if nothing happens,
you may wait.

657
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,981
Come on, Texas, if you're coming.

658
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:51,219
You mean then you won't mind...

659
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:56,795
if I pretend I really am
your best girl, will you?

660
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,576
You reckon you can't do that
all alone.

661
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,723
Come, Buck.
You're holding us up.

662
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:32,898
I’ll pray for you.

663
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:35,498
Goodbye.

664
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,408
- Get up there.
- I’ll be back.

665
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:27,423
Them West Texas boys
will rally them all.

666
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:30,086
What are they trying to do?
Scare them to death?

667
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:37,422
No!
No, that ain't the way!

668
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:40,269
What do you think you're doing?
You ain't hurting chickens out there...

669
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,295
you're hurting the horses that way!

670
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:51,280
You dumb blue bunch
of damn Yankees riggers, you!

671
00:55:54,512 --> 00:55:56,552
Do these greybacks know nothing
about horses at all?

672
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,887
If they keep that they'll chase them
to the next county.

673
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,412
That's it.

674
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:04,360
Well, we've come to help
and sure look like they need it.

675
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,623
Come on, Miller.

676
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:39,428
That's the way!

677
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,430
All right, you clowns with
the two left feet!

678
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:45,060
Get out of there and let them
Concho boys saddle the horses.

679
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,334
Hello, boys.

680
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:05,614
- We sure are obliged to you all.
- Nothing to it.

681
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,382
Just like back home.

682
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:08,450
I'm Mercer Barnes...

683
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:11,253
first sergeant with these
Pensacola Light Blues.

684
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:15,123
- This is Tellis Yeager, he's a corporal.
- How you doing? Please to meet you.

685
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,925
We're the Concho County Comanche's.

686
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:19,261
We're on our way to Richmond to join up
General Hood Texas' Brigade.

687
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:20,524
Richmond, in Virginia.

688
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:24,867
We might be able to
make it a little bit easier for you.

689
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,428
Come on over to the tent.
The Colonel wants to see you.

690
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,432
- A real Colonel?
- Double register and stamped.

691
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,938
- We're gonna meet a Colonel.
- Come on.

692
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:37,446
- Sou you're meaning to sign up?
- Yes, sir.

693
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,681
- As soon as we get to Richmond.
- Maybe I can help you out.

694
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,183
How would you like
to sign up here and now?

695
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,277
Kind of return you
the favor you did us.

696
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,114
Sir, that would be fine!

697
00:58:45,409 --> 00:58:47,489
You mean we would be
on army pay from right now, sir?

698
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,325
- That's what I mean.
- That would be fine, Colonel.

699
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:52,494
- We appreciate it.
- I'm glad to do it, boys.

700
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:54,363
Face the flag and raise
your right hands.

701
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,423
All you say "l do"
after this oath.

702
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,101
Do each of you solemnly swear to
protect the allegiance and the honor...

703
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:00,335
of the Confederate States of America...

704
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:02,538
now and days forward with
life and limbs so help you God?

705
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,172
I do.

706
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:05,841
You're now members
of the army of the Confederacy.

707
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,207
- Congratulations. Sergeant?
- Sir?

708
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,441
Right, hike!

709
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,080
That means turn to your right.

710
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:14,447
That's the way, boys.
Forward, hike!

711
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:23,220
Well, sergeant.
There's the stage, so...

712
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,933
You best be waving goodbye to it,
because you're in the army now.

713
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:32,868
The Pensacola Light Blues.

714
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,270
Out. Out.

715
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:37,738
Wait a minute...

716
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,707
- But we're going to Richmond.
- Virginia.

717
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:44,413
No, you ain't.

718
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,746
First you all will go to Mississippi.

719
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,885
Then you're going to Tennessee
and on up to Shiloh...

720
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:52,154
with twenty thousand infantry...

721
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:54,222
because we're fixing the shove
after General Bragg...

722
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:57,590
and the blue belly soldiers of his
pluming to lake Erie.

723
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:00,262
We're not infantry,
we're cavalry.

724
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:04,700
The only cavalry you're gonna see
is the end of the north horses.

725
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:07,769
Because Colonel Boykin needs someone
to handle General Bragg's remount...

726
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,338
and you're it.

727
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:13,275
- Who is this General Bragg?
- General Bragg?

728
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:17,107
He's your commander officer.

729
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:21,416
And he's the meanest,
the nastiest...

730
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:25,683
the shortest temper human being
that you'll ever going to meet up with.

731
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,919
In front, move 'er.

732
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:44,363
Okay, you goddamn boys.
Let's get the horses line down.

733
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:48,906
- Sargent Barnes!
- Sir.

734
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:51,637
- Get those men over here.
- Yes, sir General Bragg.

735
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:54,908
Alright, you, long hairs. Fall over
here by the general, come on.

736
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,520
Coronal.
Why aren't those men in uniform?

737
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:00,422
Hasn't anybody told them
anything about military discipline?

738
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,257
Well, sir, they've been so busy
taking care of your...

739
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:04,526
l don't want your excuses, I want
them to look and act like soldiers.

740
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:06,017
- ls that clear?
- Yes, sir.

741
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,363
Well...

742
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,398
which one of you
is the best hand with a horse?

743
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,138
Hell bells, general.
We're all a half horse.

744
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:18,940
You're gonna be half skin if you
don't start talking like a soldier.

745
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:21,343
Learn to say "yes, sir" and "no, sir"'
when addressed by an officer.

746
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,777
Is that clear?

747
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,437
Clear as a pimple...

748
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:28,612
- Yes, sir.
- Alright.

749
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,353
Which man is the best
hand with a horse?

750
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,522
That would be our captain, sir,
Buck Burnett.

751
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,425
- Burnett, step out.
- Nice to meet you, general.

752
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:39,486
Are you people deliberately
trying to antagonize me?

753
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:43,465
- No, sir.
- Alright, Burnett, you stay with me.

754
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,367
Coronal, take these man down.
See if they get an outfit.

755
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,401
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute.

756
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,563
- You ain't busting us up, are you?
- What did you say?

757
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:52,474
What I mean, general, is if we
could just hunker down and chatter...

758
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,543
maybe we could
figure this whole thing out.

759
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:58,674
- Do you, by any chance, mean "talk"?
- Yeah, I guess so.

760
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,650
- What he's trying to say, sir...
- Alright.

761
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:03,285
Never let it be said
that Braxton Bragg...

762
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,345
didn't listen
to the voices of his men.

763
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:07,013
Go ahead, soldier. Talk.

764
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:10,959
Well, sir, as seen as how Eubie
and me and the rest of the boys....

765
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,829
come all the way
from Pecos, Concho...

766
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:16,965
it sure don't seem right
to split us up right about...

767
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,434
- when there's some fight to be done.
- Hell no, general.

768
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:21,803
You just think about it: us,
Concho County Comanche's...

769
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:23,839
are damn just a bunch of
Yankee killers you ever did seen.

770
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,842
I bet there ain't a whole troop in the
Confederate Army better than us.

771
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:30,412
And you can tie that hard and fast,
general. We come here to fight.

772
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,482
Coronal, put this man under arrest.
You, pick up the best pony...

773
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:34,983
and bring him up to my tent.
Smith!

774
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:37,145
Wait a minute. Why does he
wanna go and arrest me for?

775
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:41,523
I don't reckon he went
through the proper channels.

776
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:43,185
No harm done, boys.

777
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,660
We'll get you looking like soldiers
and you'll feel better.

778
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:48,330
- Come along.
- Follow the colonel, will you?

779
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:49,457
Come on.

780
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:03,770
Buck! Buck Burnett!

781
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,476
Over here!

782
01:03:11,074 --> 01:03:12,954
Tennessee’s got the wettest rain
l ever did see.

783
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,122
- Buck.
- Hi, boys.

784
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,690
- How are you, Little Bit?
- What have you been doing?

785
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,793
- Shoveling. How about you?
- We've been drilling...

786
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,922
in right face in a bob face
until we're flat fed up with it.

787
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:25,500
- You don't sound too good, Little Bit.
- I’ve got the chill. Can't shake them.

788
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,903
- He's got a fever too.
- What are you doing in this rain?

789
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:30,202
- We had to come and see you.
- Come on, in there.

790
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,331
Come on.

791
01:03:40,498 --> 01:03:42,818
Buck, this whole thing ain't
working up the way we figured.

792
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,020
Yeah, we're horse soldiers
and they got us scratching gravel.

793
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,722
- I reckon the army knows best.
- I think we oughta get out of here...

794
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:49,520
and head to Virginia,
like we started.

795
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:52,388
We can't do that.
That would be desertion.

796
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:56,763
Anyways, we're moving up the line
tomorrow, we'll get to see a fight.

797
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,168
I’ve been thinking...

798
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:02,899
l ain't got a damn thing against
a Yankee. I’ve never seen one.

799
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:07,738
Well, this is war.
We're Southerners; we gotta fight.

800
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,945
- lt's a matter of freedom.
- Whose freedom?

801
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,308
Like that slave we took in, Buck?

802
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:16,550
Look what happened to him!

803
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,954
- What happened to him?
- Never mind, Eubie.

804
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:21,489
No, I want to know
what happened to him.

805
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,014
They hung him!

806
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:26,088
We took him to the sheriff
and the sheriff hung him.

807
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:32,467
- ls that true, Buck?
- Yeah, I guess it is.

808
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,669
- The colonel lied.
- That don't make no sense.

809
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,661
- Why would they go and do that?
- I don't know.

810
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:40,108
He run away to be free.

811
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:43,243
Isn’t that why we're here for?
To be free?

812
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,510
A lot of things just don't make
no more sense.

813
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:49,484
The way them folks throw us
out the cotillion back in Mendota.

814
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:51,316
J.C. getting killed.

815
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,455
Us, busted up.

816
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:55,557
And now getting ready to go to a battle
we don't know anything about...

817
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,048
not even why.

818
01:04:57,326 --> 01:05:00,853
Well, I can tell you
it's gonna be a battle.

819
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:04,261
I overheard General Bragg
and General Beauregard...

820
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,627
arguing about how we're suppose
to move up against the Yankees.

821
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,835
You know, Bragg lost.

822
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:14,476
He comes over and said to me:
"Boy, you know any prayers?".

823
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:15,876
I said: "Yes, sir."

824
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:20,715
He said:
"Say them, boy. Say them".

825
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,083
Man, that's dismo.

826
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,489
Hey.

827
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,059
I bet you five
that you don't make it.

828
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:43,390
Make it ten, Buck.
You'll make some money.

829
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:48,960
Hey, I just talked to
that Sergeant Barnes...

830
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:52,470
he said you're just pretending so you
don't have to fight Yankees tomorrow.

831
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:57,470
You ain't got to say nothing, Buck.
Just stay here.

832
01:06:58,247 --> 01:06:59,805
Hey, man, you be quiet.

833
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:07,246
Todo seem right, Buck.
We've come all this way...

834
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:10,824
- l'm dying...
- Nobody is dying.

835
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,231
You know what l'm doing?

836
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:24,439
I'm taking care of one
broken down plug.

837
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:28,103
You know the old lady general rides?
Ain't that a laugh?

838
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:34,375
All I got to do is keep him settled up
and ready to stamp.

839
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:38,053
- Ain't that a way to fight a war?
- Slack off, Buck.

840
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:41,023
You're fooling me.
Just sit there, alright?

841
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:53,297
Easy, boy.

842
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:56,471
Buck? Buck?

843
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:02,535
The candle's out.

844
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:37,437
Now, gentlemen.
Mark well the hour.

845
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:40,313
Now, you listen to that.

846
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,227
Sir.

847
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,893
You tell General Johnson
word for word...

848
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,637
that I’ve hit Sherman and
l'm driving back toward the river.

849
01:09:38,335 --> 01:09:40,775
But there's an opening in my
right flank and I want it closed.

850
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:43,176
- Do you got that?
- Yes, sir.

851
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:11,338
Howdy, Buck.

852
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,208
Todo, what you're going to do?

853
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:23,409
Hell of a mess, ain't it, Buck?
Everything just came apart.

854
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:28,287
Well...
better not talk.

855
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:32,526
- Got some water, Buck?
- Yeah.

856
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:35,424
I’ll get it, Todo.

857
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:36,616
Miller!

858
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:39,620
Miller!

859
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:41,793
Buck!

860
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:46,334
Well, Texas!
You made it this far.

861
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:48,836
I thought he was a runner.
Where's your horse?

862
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:52,206
It was killed back there.
I gotta get through to General Johnson.

863
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:55,276
You ain't heard?
Johnson's dead.

864
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:58,646
He called a Yankee "miniball".
That's a fact.

865
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,815
I heard Beauregard
has taken over command.

866
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:04,319
Well, as soon as I get a horse
l better tell back to Bragg.

867
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,554
I don't hardly reckon you
to do that either.

868
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,156
Sherman was busted too
on the left.

869
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,557
There's a couple Yankees
between us and Bragg.

870
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:12,761
Why don't you
come along with us, Buck?

871
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:16,130
I might as well.
Where are you going?

872
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:19,467
Well, if we go down this road
and through the trees...

873
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,732
there's Yankees on the other side.

874
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,264
Miller...

875
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:27,338
Todo is dead.

876
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:33,137
I saw him get it.
Hoped he would make it through.

877
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:36,851
There you go, Texas. Everything
you need for squirrel shoot.

878
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,252
Alright, let's move out.
Come on.

879
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:05,680
- How about the rest of them?
- We ain't done so good, Buck.

880
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:07,774
This war ain't working out
the way I thought.

881
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:10,478
Willie Bill, he got a miniball
right between the eyes.

882
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:13,215
Eubie?

883
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:18,385
Well, the Yankees were
shouting something awful.

884
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:21,162
One of them mortars in a big gun
blow up right on us.

885
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,364
And Eubie just wasn't there no more.

886
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:25,128
Damn.

887
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:30,405
Sure ain't nothing
like I thought it would be.

888
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,940
Listen, there's Yankees on
the other side of this ridge...

889
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,075
and we're going to get them.

890
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,306
Now you best fasten on
your pick stickers.

891
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:42,476
I figured them Yankees would
take one look at us and run.

892
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:44,576
They ain't about to.

893
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,688
They don't give up easy.
Well, I don't understand it.

894
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:49,557
We're fighting for the South.
They invaded us...

895
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:51,287
what they've got to fight about?

896
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,829
- Whatever it is, they're still on it.
- Alright.

897
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,422
Let's go!

898
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:04,692
Hey, Texas!

899
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:07,529
Texas!

900
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:24,377
It's me, Texas. Mercer Barnes.

901
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:29,056
What happened?

902
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:31,855
They covered and got shot up
all over the place.

903
01:15:32,475 --> 01:15:34,395
I’ve been trying to round up
what's left of them.

904
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:37,263
- How long you all been in here?
- I don't know.

905
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:41,560
I was running
and everything blew up.

906
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:44,402
Miller?

907
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:46,731
Miller, is that you?

908
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:48,736
That ain't Miller.

909
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,442
We got a Yank in here?

910
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:56,684
Now, Texas, there's
an old saying among soldiers:

911
01:15:56,685 --> 01:16:00,488
"When the miniballs is flying and
the artillery is hotter than hell...

912
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:02,582
there ain't no such thing
as an enemy".

913
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:07,595
Besides he was here in first.

914
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:11,088
It doesn't seem neighborly
to throw him out now.

915
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,463
- Hi there.
- Hello.

916
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:19,240
He's feeling kind of poorly.
Caught one in the belly.

917
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,474
It's a hell of a war.

918
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:22,376
Hey, Mercy.
You think is going to rain?

919
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:24,436
Yeah, more than likely.

920
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:28,876
We oughta take that Yankee
out of the weather.

921
01:16:29,153 --> 01:16:32,153
It's bad enough he's bleeding to death,
no sense he gotta get pneumonia too.

922
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:34,388
I surely wouldn't know
where we could go.

923
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:37,625
- Well, there must be someplace.
- There's an old church up the road.

924
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:39,594
If you fellows give me a hand,
I’ll guide you there.

925
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:43,292
- What do you think?
- Well, it will be drowning, I reckon.

926
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,701
Yeah, come on. Let's go.
Give me your hand, Yank.

927
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:47,964
Come on.

928
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,603
Come on, Texas.

929
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:32,580
We ain't alone.

930
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,783
I got a gun here that says
you better put that light out.

931
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,422
And shut that door.

932
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:52,433
We have no light because
old Bragg got his damn Provos...

933
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,925
out there hunting down
straight way from the fighting.

934
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:57,717
I guess he figures too many of us
is getting lost deliberately.

935
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,507
This ain't good.

936
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,076
We don't wanna get caught
with these here stragglers.

937
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:04,879
Bragg would shoot us first
and then ask the questions.

938
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,349
- He would shoot me, sure.
- Now that you are here, I better get back.

939
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:13,020
- I reckon he figures you're dead.
- I ain't a deserter.

940
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,318
Buck!

941
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:16,755
You made it.

942
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:18,592
I thought for sure
you had stop with that mini ball.

943
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:22,689
- Found me whole.
- I got a friend here that's going fast.

944
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:26,532
He could use some scripture reading.
Anybody know any?

945
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:32,003
There's me.
My father is a preacher up in Boston.

946
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:35,109
Boys, we've got
a blue belly in with us.

947
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:38,773
I don't know what color his belly is,
but is bleeding red now.

948
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:43,081
- He got shot.
- Let the Yankee read.

949
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:46,777
- I reckon is the same Bible.
- Come on, boy.

950
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:56,663
Somebody... make a light.

951
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:01,902
- I barely can look at his face.
- Bragg's Provo will see the light.

952
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:04,371
The hell with Bragg's Provo.
My friend is dying.

953
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:05,964
Somebody light up.

954
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:15,741
"He opened his mouth
and taught them, saying:"

955
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:20,412
Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

956
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:24,454
Blessed are they that mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

957
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:29,059
Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth.

958
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:31,857
Blessed are the peacemakers...

959
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:34,862
for they shall be called
children of God.

960
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:42,443
Love your enemies,
bless them that curse you;

961
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,942
do good to them that hate you...

962
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:48,577
and pray for them
which despitefully use you...

963
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,782
and persecute you.

964
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:55,723
The Lord is my shepherd,
l shall not want.

965
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:00,089
Maketh me to lie down
in green pastures...

966
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:03,956
He leadeth me beside
still waters.

967
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:06,333
"He restoreth my soul..."

968
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:08,901
Buck, someone is out there.

969
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:10,263
Come on.

970
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,302
Everybody raise your hands.
You're all under arrest.

971
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:18,345
All right, boys.
Move out. Come on. Get out.

972
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:19,438
Come on.

973
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:49,503
You all right?

974
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:51,941
Come on,
we gotta get out of here.

975
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:01,080
All right, move out.
Come on!

976
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:15,031
I'm sorry, Texas.

977
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:18,872
- I gotta help them.
- You gotta help yourself.

978
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:23,610
- And Miller?
- Ain't nothing you can do.

979
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:29,480
Anyway, them Provos would kill you
before you got any place close to him.

980
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:33,520
You can hardly move
with that arm of yours.

981
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:37,258
Now listen to me. Old Bragg is
too busy with troubles of his own...

982
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:39,193
to have him shot right away.

983
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:41,754
Maybe we can do something later on.

984
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:47,256
All right, Mercer.
All right.

985
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:52,436
I ain't letting Bragg
or God all mighty shoot my friend.

986
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,373
You hear that, Mercer?

987
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:39,351
Mr. Burnett.
What do you think you're doing?

988
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:43,655
I sure wanna thank you
for everything you've done.

989
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:45,159
Being so nice and all...

990
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:49,363
- I just gotta be getting out of here.
- But the doctor didn't say you could go.

991
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:52,366
I reckon he's got more
important things on his mind.

992
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:55,393
And hell I know more about
how good I feel than he does.

993
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:02,775
Ma'am, is the General Bragg's Provos
officers here in town?

994
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:05,913
At the railroad station.
But you shouldn't go.

995
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:10,248
Well, I reckon if I don't get word
with General Bragg that l'm all right...

996
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,950
he won't sleep at night.

997
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:16,655
Anyway, I gotta see
about a friend of my.

998
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:19,589
I guess I can't stop you.

999
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:23,362
When you see Gabrielle,
give her my regards.

1000
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:27,601
- How come you know about her?
- After they took your arm off...

1001
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:30,969
when you were delirious,
she's all you talked about.

1002
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:34,973
- ls she a nice girl?
- Yes, ma'am.

1003
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:37,368
Very nice.

1004
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:42,878
Thank you.

1005
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,126
Buck!

1006
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:05,272
Texas! I knew you would be
one of the lucky ones!

1007
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:08,275
- That's our boy.
- What are you doing on Provos' duty?

1008
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:10,044
The Light Blues got so busted up...

1009
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,546
there wasn't enough of us left
to even stand roll.

1010
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,572
They sent old Telli and me
down here.

1011
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:17,343
- How you've been.
- Well, good as pie.

1012
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:19,119
Sure won't win,
but I can manage.

1013
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,755
I figure that night at the church
you weren't likely to lose.

1014
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:23,057
I'm sorry.

1015
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,392
- l'm still here.
- It's kind of a shame, though...

1016
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:28,191
the only time you were wounded
had to be by a Southern bullet.

1017
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,330
Kind of a friendly wound,
wouldn't you say?

1018
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:34,064
Since you're in Provos' duty, maybe you
can tell me what's happened to Miller.

1019
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:40,871
I got me a detachment to take care of.
You tell him, Tellis.

1020
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:44,902
Tell me what?

1021
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:50,117
Buck, I rather be in our shape
than Miller's.

1022
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:51,346
He escaped.

1023
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:54,587
Had him chained up
on a working party.

1024
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:56,090
Don't know exactly what happened...

1025
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,390
but he swung that chain lay down
his guard and took off.

1026
01:25:00,328 --> 01:25:04,230
The only thing is he split
that guard's head wide open.

1027
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:06,299
He killed him, Buck.

1028
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:08,802
No.

1029
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:11,772
Now General Bragg put down
special orders on him.

1030
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,571
Get him dead or alive,
just assumed dead.

1031
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:18,642
Never thought Miller would run
like a jack rabbit.

1032
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:20,776
Well, not no more, he don't.

1033
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:25,319
A cracker named Junger says
a tough fellow like Miller...

1034
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,619
tried to hide in his barn.
Says he put a bullet into him.

1035
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:33,518
Appears he's still in the barn.
Mercer is fixing to go get him now.

1036
01:25:33,828 --> 01:25:35,887
The man would do a thing like that?
Shoot him?

1037
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:37,898
A lot known they all crackers.

1038
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:40,527
They're making a business
turning the boys over to Provos.

1039
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:46,907
- Where did you say his place is at?
- Junger Virginhood.

1040
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:50,207
It's ten miles out.
We'll get him.

1041
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:52,373
Yeah, right.

1042
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:55,782
That's a very nice horse.

1043
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:58,411
- That's yours, Tellis?
- No, is Mercer's.

1044
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:02,555
And it stays there,
in case you got any ideas.

1045
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:07,727
- l'm a friend of yours.
- Yeah, but you Texas is a wild bunch.

1046
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:13,257
I don't know.
Ain't that Colonel Boykin?

1047
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:15,631
- I thought he was dead.
- Where?

1048
01:26:24,379 --> 01:26:27,075
Hey, you! Hey there, Buck!

1049
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:29,777
Come back here, Buck!
Come back here!

1050
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:35,379
- He got your horse, Mercer.
- There's a lot more horses.

1051
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:41,191
Damn, damn, damn it all.
Now there's two I might get.

1052
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:13,453
Miller?

1053
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:17,424
Buck?

1054
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:20,595
Buck?

1055
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:33,337
You...

1056
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,350
hit bad?

1057
01:27:37,952 --> 01:27:39,647
Pretty bad.

1058
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:42,551
In the belly?

1059
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:45,255
That's where it came out.

1060
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:49,391
I was kind of hoping
that you would come.

1061
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:53,066
We're getting out of here
and we're going to Texas.

1062
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:56,460
I can't move, Buck.

1063
01:27:58,172 --> 01:28:00,834
I'm all frozen up
and dried out inside.

1064
01:28:02,577 --> 01:28:05,808
I would like you to kill me first now,
it don't hardly hurt at all.

1065
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:09,506
- We'll make it.
- You'll make it.

1066
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,750
It's only two days to big river.

1067
01:28:15,723 --> 01:28:18,021
You go on back to Texas.

1068
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:21,088
No.

1069
01:28:21,763 --> 01:28:25,460
You ain't a captain no more.
You gotta go.

1070
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:31,403
You go back to Vicksburg
and pick up that girl.

1071
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:42,249
Buck?

1072
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:46,553
I hit that guard pretty hard.

1073
01:28:46,554 --> 01:28:49,455
- Did I hurt him bad?
- You killed him, Miller.

1074
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:53,460
- I didn't mean to.
- I know, Miller.

1075
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:55,829
They said they were gonna shoot me.

1076
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,390
What did I do to get shot for?

1077
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:02,166
I don't know.

1078
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:06,206
I know nothing about
this damn war.

1079
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:09,233
Todo, Eubie...

1080
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:14,678
Little Bit, Willie Bill, J.C.,
they're all dead.

1081
01:29:18,419 --> 01:29:21,411
We didn't make of a splash, did we?

1082
01:29:23,257 --> 01:29:25,248
That pretty girl in Mendota...

1083
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:28,852
she said we were Southern patriots.

1084
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:39,071
- Remember when we kissed her hand?
- Yeah. I remember.

1085
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:42,266
Wasn't that something?

1086
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:51,246
We sure done some living,
ain't we, Buck?

1087
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:54,083
We're gonna do a lot more.

1088
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:58,925
Somebody is outside.
Provos is after me.

1089
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:00,416
No, there ain't nobody.

1090
01:30:02,163 --> 01:30:05,929
You better get going now, Buck.
I ain't gonna be here for long now.

1091
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:12,033
Miller?

1092
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:16,643
- Do you wanna pray?
- No.

1093
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:20,142
I’ve already done my praying.

1094
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:25,276
I'm glad you are with me.

1095
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:29,122
Buck, Miller, get out of there
with your hands up!

1096
01:30:29,123 --> 01:30:31,091
We got this place surrounded.

1097
01:30:31,692 --> 01:30:33,421
We need to get out of here.

1098
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:37,964
Please. Please God, Buck.
Don't move me.

1099
01:30:41,335 --> 01:30:42,962
Miller...

1100
01:30:46,674 --> 01:30:49,666
Buck!
This is your last chance!

1101
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:51,603
I’ll get you out of here, Miller.

1102
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,449
I’ll cover you from up here,
they ain't gonna get you. I promise.

1103
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:58,476
Buck, this is the last time
l'm gonna ask you!

1104
01:31:16,437 --> 01:31:18,132
- Sargent Barnes?
- Sir.

1105
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:19,873
What are you doing here?

1106
01:31:19,874 --> 01:31:22,809
There's a couple of deserters
in the barn there, sir.

1107
01:31:22,877 --> 01:31:25,345
- Drag them out and shoot them.
- Yes, sir.

1108
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:28,248
One of them is one of them Texas boys,
with your horse orderly.

1109
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:32,285
- That Buck Burnett, sir.
- He's in there? A deserter?

1110
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:35,619
Yes, sir.
He was in the hospital, sir...

1111
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:40,727
Well, I reckon you gotta call him
a deserter, he stole a horse...

1112
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:43,430
and came out here looking for
his friend, Corporal Nalls.

1113
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:45,296
The one that killed the guard.

1114
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:47,801
Let's get him out of there.

1115
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:13,123
Barnes?

1116
01:32:23,604 --> 01:32:26,767
It's Nalls, general.
He's dead.

1117
01:32:27,275 --> 01:32:30,510
- Where's the other one?
- He's gotta be in here someplace.

1118
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:33,071
That's my horse he stole
tied up outside.

1119
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:39,719
With the general's permission, sir...

1120
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,888
the way I heard it,
seven of them come down here...

1121
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:44,324
all the way from West Texas
to join up.

1122
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:47,460
Nobody named them.
Just boys they were.

1123
01:32:47,461 --> 01:32:49,759
- So?
- Well...

1124
01:32:50,498 --> 01:32:53,695
This Burnett is the last
one of them left alive...

1125
01:32:54,035 --> 01:32:57,170
seems kind of a shame
to hunt down the last one.

1126
01:32:57,171 --> 01:33:00,440
- One of them oughta get back to Texas.
- He stole a horse...

1127
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:04,311
and deserted in my army.
We shoot men for that.

1128
01:33:04,312 --> 01:33:10,083
Yeah, I known, it just seems a shame.
I know all them boys.

1129
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:12,746
There's no room for
sentiment in the army.

1130
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:19,586
- No, I reckon there ain't.
- Discipline is discipline.

1131
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:24,264
A soldiers obeys orders
or suffers for it.

1132
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:27,860
- ls that clear?
- That's clear, general.

1133
01:33:30,004 --> 01:33:33,269
Sergeant!
Where the hell are you going?

1134
01:33:33,507 --> 01:33:37,568
- l'm going up there and dig him out.
- A man would be a fool to hide up there.

1135
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:40,545
That boy is halfway to Texas by now.

1136
01:33:40,648 --> 01:33:45,415
- But my horse is still tied up outside.
- Are you arguing with me, sergeant?

1137
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:49,384
- No, sir. No.
- All right.

1138
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:52,692
Get that body in the wagon
and let's get out of here.

1139
01:33:52,693 --> 01:33:54,327
We've got too much to do
to waste time...

1140
01:33:54,328 --> 01:33:57,991
- running after one Texas straggler.
- Yes, sir general.

1141
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:25,082
Sergeant?

1142
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:28,294
Are you trying to argue me?
What are you doing?

1143
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:31,064
I was just fixing to take
my horse along, sir.

1144
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:32,699
You leave that horse here.
You ride the wagon.

1145
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,601
Sent someone to pick that horse
in the morning.

1146
01:34:34,602 --> 01:34:37,837
Yes, sir. Of course,
with all these stragglers around...

1147
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:40,340
I’d run a bet that horse
won't be here in the morning.

1148
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:43,640
- Just follow orders, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

1149
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:46,780
As a matter of fact, I’d be
willing to say that horse is gone...

1150
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:49,215
before we run one mile
on the road.

1151
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:55,553
Move your men out.

1152
01:34:55,623 --> 01:34:56,749
