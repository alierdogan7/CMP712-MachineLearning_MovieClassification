501
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,984
...they all turned out
to be the same man.

502
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,526
And he lives on the res.

503
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:41,889
- Really?
- Yeah.

504
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,090
What'd he have to say?

505
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:46,236
Well, nothing, now,
because he's in the hospital.

506
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,862
Unconscious.
He was admitted two days ago.

507
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,338
And his wife says
that he took a bad fall.

508
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,103
But the doctors are pretty sure
that he was beaten.

510
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,344
Uh, Henry. On line one.

511
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,391
- I found Hector.
HENRY: Good.

512
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:13,427
But I have something better.
Come alone. I just closed for the day.

513
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,632
They were here when I
arrived this morning. In my office.

514
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,738
Back door was wide open.

515
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:27,041
- Who brought them in?
- Ask them.

516
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,081
Hello, boys. You doing okay?

517
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,553
A lot of people gonna be very happy
to see you.

518
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,817
Um...

519
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,286
Can you tell me who took you?

520
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,125
The dog soldier.

521
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,067
Let me guess.

522
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,900
He took you at midnight,
as the myth goes.

523
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:00,909
No, it was after bed-check,
which is at 10 p.m.

524
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,920
Are you calling Family Services,
or can they go back to their real families?

525
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:16,459
By law, I should call Family Services.

526
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:17,992
But?

527
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,791
Just because it's lawful
don't make it right.

528
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,128
This, we know.

529
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,671
I look at my friend's face
and I want to know what happened.

530
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,125
Hector used his one phone call.
You'll never guess to who.

531
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,272
NIGHTHORSE: Morning, sheriff.
- Hello, Jacob.

532
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,688
This man's being held
without being charged with a crime.

533
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,514
Objection. Look at his face.

534
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,984
NIGHTHORSE: Hector has been
in custody for eight hours.

535
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,782
You have to charge him or let him go.

536
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:49,358
Actually, Jacob, I have 24 hours
before I have to charge him.

537
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,018
- Ask your lawyer.
- If you're holding Hector for kidnapping...

538
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,357
...you have no evidence
to charge him with.

539
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,433
Really, how do you know that?

540
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,501
Because if you had any evidence,
you would have charged him already.

541
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,163
And if those children turn up healthy
and unharmed...

542
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,537
...not only will you be forced
to release Hector...

543
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,976
...but you could be subject to a civil
suit. You could be charged. You could...

544
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:13,345
- You're not even listening to me.
- What? No.

545
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,883
Not really.

546
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,853
But you've convinced me.
Release the prisoner.

547
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,922
- Excuse me?
- Walt. What are you doing?

548
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:23,549
I had a vision.
A vision of empty pockets.

549
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,923
Hector's a hired gun.
He only works for pay.

550
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,066
These boys' families, they could never
afford to pay Hector, could they?

551
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,433
That is a good point.

552
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:34,901
Someone else must have paid him.
Someone with a lot of money.

553
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:40,034
Interesting. Just a shame that visions
never hold up in your courts.

554
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,841
Hector.

555
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,547
This is me letting you go.

556
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,917
VIC:
I'm sorry, but I'm concerned.

557
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,852
- Did you get a concussion last night?
- Nope. I'm fine.

558
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,720
Then why else
would you let our prime suspect go?

559
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,862
The boys were returned to the Red Pony
while Hector was in custody.

560
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,122
By who?

561
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,392
They all claim the dog soldier took them
and brought them back.

562
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:06,128
- Okay, what about murder?
- And attempted murder?

563
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,795
Not to mention the beating
that Hector gave you.

564
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,302
WALT: Sometimes the best way
to catch the killer...

565
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,774
...is to make them think they're free.

566
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,117
I know who's responsible
for the murder of Ryan Shank...

567
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,723
...and the threat on your life.

568
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,554
But I can't prosecute
without your help.

569
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,423
So...

570
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:37,061
- This the man who threatened you?
- Yes.

571
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,601
His name is Hector.
He's a Cheyenne mercenary.

572
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,794
Pretty scary guy.

573
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,431
He did this to me.

574
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,177
Don't worry. I brought him
into custody late last night.

575
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,679
- Oh. That's good to hear.
- Released him a few hours ago.

576
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,114
What?

577
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,619
He tried to kill me.
And you said he killed Ryan.

578
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,451
I thought so.
I know on the night of the kidnapping...

579
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,459
...he assaulted Ryan, took the boys
around 10 p.m...

580
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,824
...right after their last bed-check.

581
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,827
Here's what's confusing.

582
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:16,368
Ryan made a phone call at 10:34,
alive and well.

583
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:17,700
He called you.

584
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,472
- I told you we talked that night.
- Ryan had just been assaulted.

585
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,582
The boys had been kidnapped.
Why call you? Why not my deputy?

586
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,118
I don't know.

587
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:31,187
He called to tell you
someone had discovered your scam.

588
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,390
You take Cheyenne kids
from their families...

589
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,072
...place them in Shank's group home,
collect the federal money.

590
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:41,030
I don't get any extra pay
for reservation children.

591
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,689
Not up front.

592
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,529
Shank took the extra federal money
and split it with you.

593
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,228
All those children
are in better hands now.

594
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,898
I was following up on reports
of abuse or neglect.

595
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:56,637
All those reports of neglect or abuse
were made by one man.

596
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,641
He was your plant.

597
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:04,845
He'd call in some fake complaints
for you in exchange for a little money.

598
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,650
You stole all these children
from their homes.

599
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:12,262
I do whatever I have to do
to protect children from neglect.

600
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,160
I'm betting you'd do whatever
you have to do to protect yourself.

601
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,561
I think you saw Ryan Shank
after he called you.

602
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,772
I bet he was scared
after seeing Hector.

603
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,875
I bet he wanted to come clean.

604
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:29,171
But you weren't ready
to turn yourself in.

605
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,441
So you ran him over, repeatedly.

606
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,882
The next night, you drove yourself
into a tree...

607
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:40,023
...to cover up the damage to your car.

608
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:43,251
Shank had described the big,
scary Indian with the scar to you.

609
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,557
So you knew exactly what to tell me
to frame Hector.

610
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,860
I've devoted my entire life
to helping children.

611
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,303
That's certainly what
a Wyoming jury will see.

612
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,237
They'll see an articulate,
compassionate...

613
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:03,073
...white social worker accused
with circumstantial evidence.

614
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,612
You're right.

615
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:10,982
They won't see the cynical, burned-out
sociopath who's just out for herself.

616
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:15,056
You'll walk free.
Legally it's the perfect crime.

617
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,659
But there's something
you're forgetting.

618
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,626
Hector.

619
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,431
He knows about your scam, Crystal.

620
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,133
Also knows you tried
to frame him for murder.

621
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,974
Right. He'll make a great witness.

622
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,580
The scar-faced Indian
who kidnapped those boys.

623
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,112
The boys said it wasn't him.

624
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:42,412
They say a dog soldier abducted them.

625
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:47,080
The Cheyenne believe
an avenging warrior spirit...

626
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,421
...can take on any form.
Animal, human.

627
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:54,724
- And you believe that?
- I believe in transformation.

628
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,467
I believe we become vessels...

629
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:04,168
...for forces
we cannot control or understand.

630
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,378
When you drove over Ryan Shank...

631
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:13,340
...maybe it was the spirit
of the dog soldier that guided you.

632
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:19,616
Perhaps that spirit guided me,
once upon a time, as well.

633
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,655
So congratulations.

634
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,200
Without your confession,
we have no case against you.

635
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,872
But the dog soldier knows
what you've done, Crystal.

636
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:44,040
And when he comes for you,
I'm just a phone call...

637
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,149
...and a 20-minute drive away.

638
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,826
I'll come as fast as I can.
