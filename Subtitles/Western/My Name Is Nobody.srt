1
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,197
<i>Mr. Beauregard!</i>

2
00:03:34,803 --> 00:03:37,772
We have an answer for you
from New Orleans.

3
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:39,098
What 'd they say?

4
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:42,572
"Sundowner sails at 21st.
Stop.

5
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:47,407
Destination Europe.
Stop. Reservation...

6
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:53,645
confirmed. Stop.
Request deposit 5OO dollars. Stop."

7
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,820
- Hey! What about the 5OO dollars?
- Don't worry.

8
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:02,496
The important thing is
there's a ship.

9
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:36,491
Hey!

10
00:10:40,962 --> 00:10:42,896
1O dollars!

11
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:47,298
How'd he do it, Pa?
I know he had one shot!

12
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:49,693
It 's a question of speed, son.

13
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:53,896
Pa, ain't nobody faster than him?

14
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:56,099
Faster than him?

15
00:10:57,945 --> 00:10:59,105
Nobody.

16
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,937
Red!

17
00:15:27,982 --> 00:15:30,416
Too late to meet you.

18
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:06,219
Who did it?

19
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:08,882
You did...

20
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:12,554
when you first started
looking for me.

21
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,024
Where's Nevada?

22
00:16:16,197 --> 00:16:18,825
Hold up in Acoma.

23
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:22,025
He ain't about to move from there.

24
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:29,535
What were you doing here?
Who shot you?

25
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,734
- Go...
- Where?

26
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:41,315
You go screw yourself.

27
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:42,955
You and you alone...

28
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:46,718
was responsible to me and
my men for making the gold legal.

29
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:51,364
Instead, Sullivan, you chase
after your own personal affairs!

30
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:55,433
You're leaving a trail of dead bodies
all the way across the state!

31
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:58,161
A trail that leads straight here.

32
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:01,933
- Jack Beauregard.
- Yeah.

33
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:05,610
We pay you 'cause
you're respectable.

34
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:08,947
A gentleman!

35
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:11,913
Bought a worked out gold mine
and discovered a new vein.

36
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,384
But any suspicion that falls on you,
falls on the gold.

37
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,614
What are you afraid of?

38
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:21,283
You got everyone exactly
where you want them.

39
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:24,760
I've reached out the truth
from the rooftops.

40
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:27,024
I could bring the sheriff
in here and say:

41
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:31,603
"Look, if we didn't add
that stolen gold of yore...

42
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:35,036
this mine would
only produce rocks!"

43
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:39,540
I could even show them
and nobody would believe me.

44
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:45,418
- And they'd all be blind and deaf.
- But not dumb!

45
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:47,587
There's talk going around,
Sullivan.

46
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:51,781
Talk has a way of getting into places
where there ain't no fear.

47
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:55,154
The ore that
comes out of this mine...

48
00:17:55,362 --> 00:17:59,662
has got to be refined legally!

49
00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:03,365
You keep your hands clean,
Sullivan.

50
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:12,738
But if I don't kill Beauregard first,
he'll kill me.

51
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:16,508
That 's right.

52
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:24,480
Two things go straight to a
man's heart: bullets and gold.

53
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:30,619
You're telling me
to buy Jack Beauregard?

54
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,892
Why not?

55
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:37,136
We bought you.

56
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:42,099
Buy him or kill him!
But do it fast.

57
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:45,073
Do you hear me?
Fast!

58
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:03,522
Hey! Load up 2O
of them horseshoes.

59
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,996
- Is it going to take much longer?
- Nearly that.

60
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:14,568
You got nothing but junk here.
Look at this.

61
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:17,471
Who's gonna buy this?

62
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:20,774
And this?

63
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,384
Even a broken shoe.

64
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:46,802
Hey! You!

65
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:51,376
Hey, where'd he come from?

66
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:58,844
What are you doing in there?

67
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,748
- Sleeping.
- This ain't no hotel.

68
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:06,658
- What are you looking for?
- A horse.

69
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:22,241
Hey, make him pay first!

70
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:25,170
Why?

71
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:33,409
'Cause you don't look like you're
gonna live long enough to get credit.

72
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,195
Where are you going?

73
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:51,670
The secret of a long life
is to try not to shorten it.

74
00:20:57,478 --> 00:21:00,174
Hey! Hold on there!

75
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,712
- Maybe I can get you a horse.
- Honest?

76
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:06,977
Sure. But first you got
to do me a little favor.

77
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:09,052
Come here.

78
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:15,458
Gimme here!

79
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:19,359
There's a pal of mine
over there in that saloon.

80
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:24,731
You take him this basket. When
you get back, I'll find you a horse.

81
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:32,839
This pal of yours is
Jack Beauregard, huh?

82
00:21:33,113 --> 00:21:35,809
A bargain is a bargain.

83
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,054
- A horse, huh?
- Sure, son.

84
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:44,156
The best.

85
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:19,890
I smell beans and bacon, Bonita.

86
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:22,288
That 's right. They're for
the three men out there.

87
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:25,090
Better let me have it. I don't think
they'll be hungry much longer.

88
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:39,902
Is the ship still there?

89
00:22:40,214 --> 00:22:43,115
"Sailing takes 16 days.
Stop.

90
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:47,686
Must have 5OO dollars
to confirm reservation. Stop."

91
00:22:57,598 --> 00:22:59,862
What should I tell
New Orleans, mister?

92
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:02,467
There's still 16 days.

93
00:23:03,737 --> 00:23:06,968
16 days ain't very long.
Even for someone like you.

94
00:23:07,507 --> 00:23:10,374
If you go away,
who's gonna be left?

95
00:23:11,345 --> 00:23:12,869
Nobody.

96
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,413
Maybe so, but a man's
gotta quit sometime.

97
00:23:16,783 --> 00:23:18,614
Sometime.

98
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:22,846
But someone like you
gotta go out with style.

99
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:26,825
You come here
just to tell me that?

100
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:29,852
Oh, no.

101
00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:42,237
For me?

102
00:23:45,178 --> 00:23:47,476
What 'd you think it 's in it?

103
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:50,811
I reckon it 's a bomb.

104
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:58,322
I reckon you're right.
Who sent it?

105
00:23:59,993 --> 00:24:03,292
Three fellows out there.
Only three.

106
00:24:03,497 --> 00:24:07,126
- Only?
- Yeah, like that time in El Paso.

107
00:24:10,437 --> 00:24:13,031
5th of March, 1882.

108
00:24:13,674 --> 00:24:15,232
Billy Mason...

109
00:24:15,442 --> 00:24:16,739
John Murray...

110
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:18,934
Fred Carson.

111
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,548
82 was one of your best years.
In April...

112
00:24:22,749 --> 00:24:25,877
- Why'd you bring me this for?
- A horse.

113
00:24:26,186 --> 00:24:29,883
Like I was saying, in April,
in Albuquerque...

114
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,924
four: Jackson,
Johnson, Murdoch...

115
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:36,220
and Champion.

116
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,995
How many horses do you
want to take it back?

117
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,927
None. My pleasure.

118
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:47,229
But it was in the fall
that you really scored.

119
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:49,841
September. Socorro.

120
00:24:50,043 --> 00:24:51,067
Five.

121
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,180
Milton, Woolman, Firestone,
McDonald and Valence.

122
00:24:55,716 --> 00:24:58,810
How come you know
so much about me?

123
00:24:59,086 --> 00:25:01,316
Everyone knows about
Jack Beauregard.

124
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:04,149
Only hope for law and order
in the West.

125
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:06,019
Son, let me give you
a little advice.

126
00:25:06,226 --> 00:25:08,353
If you start admiring someone,
pretty soon you're envious...

127
00:25:08,562 --> 00:25:13,329
so you start showing off,
taking chances.

128
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:16,832
Before you know it,
you're dead.

129
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:20,438
Well, it ain't good for some folks
to live too long.

130
00:25:25,445 --> 00:25:28,414
And in Gila Blend,
how many did you get that time?

131
00:25:28,615 --> 00:25:30,981
Six. Oh, no! Seven!

132
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:34,381
Counting that fellow that tried to gun
you when you were backwards to him.

133
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:40,281
He says he don't want it!

134
00:25:41,128 --> 00:25:44,723
But you never got
15O all at once.

135
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,735
You know, since I was a boy
I always dreamed of you like that.

136
00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:54,907
An immense open plain.

137
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:59,670
15O pure bred sons of bitches
on horseback...

138
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,407
and you facing them.
Alone.

139
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,109
Why only 15O?

140
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,379
The Wild Bunch.
They are only 15O. That 's why.

141
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:14,390
Yeah, 15O and shooting right
like there's thousands.

142
00:26:14,594 --> 00:26:16,994
Who are you anyway?

143
00:26:17,197 --> 00:26:21,258
- Who? Me? Nobody.
- Tell you what...

144
00:26:21,468 --> 00:26:24,266
first you get to be somebody,
then you and me will surround them.

145
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:28,134
Yeah. Hey, that 's no good.
You got to face them alone!

146
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:31,037
You on one side,
and them on the other!

147
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,972
You won't need
to wash it this time!

148
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:47,186
What was in that basket?

149
00:26:47,394 --> 00:26:48,861
Do you want a hand?

150
00:26:49,062 --> 00:26:51,292
Hey, Jack!

151
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:55,698
Jack, I've found a horse!
Wait!

152
00:27:01,174 --> 00:27:03,165
Turn around, you!

153
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:18,055
- You mean we gotta shoot it out?
- So you're Beauregard's friend?

154
00:27:19,326 --> 00:27:23,854
I wish I was.
You know what they say?

155
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:29,325
He could draw his gun 3 times before
the other fellow even starts reaching.

156
00:27:29,536 --> 00:27:31,470
Like this.

157
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:42,747
Well, if we gotta shoot it out,
I'm ready.

158
00:27:42,949 --> 00:27:44,849
Well, just...

159
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:48,384
Hey, you gotta admit,
he did deliver the basket.

160
00:27:48,588 --> 00:27:49,680
Yeah, sure.

161
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,518
- But that son of...
- Beauregard. He didn't want it.

162
00:27:52,726 --> 00:27:55,194
You're right!
Guess you won yourself a horse.

163
00:27:55,395 --> 00:27:58,956
Thanks, "amigo".
I'll take this one.

164
00:28:12,946 --> 00:28:14,436
Help me!

165
00:28:15,015 --> 00:28:16,573
"Arinauabecapicapa."

166
00:28:16,783 --> 00:28:18,148
"Arinaua. Arinaua."

167
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,919
Blessed is the man who shares
his neighbor's burden.

168
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,404
Seen a white man around here?

169
00:29:55,448 --> 00:29:58,440
I'm looking for a white man.
Did you see him?

170
00:29:59,486 --> 00:30:01,852
Where is he?

171
00:30:03,156 --> 00:30:07,525
Don't worry. I won't hurt him.
He's my brother.

172
00:30:29,282 --> 00:30:31,375
What are you doing here?

173
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:36,646
Praying.

174
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:40,019
- Good thing you are.
- Why?

175
00:30:40,326 --> 00:30:44,023
'Cause you're always following me,
and I don't like it.

176
00:30:45,098 --> 00:30:47,896
I got a lot of friends here.

177
00:30:49,002 --> 00:30:51,698
Chief Broken Branch
died yesterday.

178
00:30:51,905 --> 00:30:55,363
The priest got there in time,
but the Medicine men didn't.

179
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:58,135
What brings you here
among the ancients anyway?

180
00:30:58,344 --> 00:31:00,938
I'm looking for someone.

181
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:10,984
"Sam Peckinpah".

182
00:31:11,658 --> 00:31:14,957
That 's a beautiful name
in Navajo.

183
00:31:16,996 --> 00:31:21,092
- Friend or enemy?
- That 's my business.

184
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:25,101
Listen to this one.

185
00:31:25,305 --> 00:31:28,832
"Renapoknomoh".

186
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:34,780
- What 's his name?
- That 's his business.

187
00:31:35,115 --> 00:31:38,016
"Nevada Kid".

188
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:45,384
You know where he is?

189
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:48,287
Must be down below.

190
00:32:18,758 --> 00:32:22,125
It 's always the best
who are the first to go.

191
00:32:23,363 --> 00:32:26,059
Which means you
ain't going nowhere.

192
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:30,698
Stay here with your
Indian friends for good.

193
00:33:00,266 --> 00:33:03,724
What 's the matter, boy?
You gotta have a crowd watching?

194
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:08,504
You said you was nobody.

195
00:33:08,775 --> 00:33:13,212
Here's your chance to make a name
for yourself on one of them.

196
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,350
Turn around!

197
00:33:20,553 --> 00:33:23,078
Draw.

198
00:33:39,572 --> 00:33:42,905
Let 's bring my personal
history up to date.

199
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:49,972
Today, June 3rd, 1899:
Nobody.

200
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:07,129
You're the kind that needs
an audience so you can show off.

201
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:11,292
Four shots, one hole.
Just like the good old days.

202
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:20,076
There was never any
"good old days".

203
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,408
Tell me, what 's your game?

204
00:34:26,185 --> 00:34:29,211
When I was a kid I used to make
believe I was Jack Beauregard.

205
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:39,623
And now that
you're all growed-up?

206
00:34:39,966 --> 00:34:44,300
I'm more cautious.
But sometimes running a little risk...

207
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:46,904
can bring bigger rewards,
you know?

208
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:54,139
If the risk is little,
the reward is little.

209
00:35:00,253 --> 00:35:03,780
First Nevada... then Red.

210
00:35:04,857 --> 00:35:08,122
- They even tried to get me twice.
- They'll try again.

211
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:13,493
What the hell are you up to?

212
00:35:13,866 --> 00:35:15,857
You'll find out.

213
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:29,527
I see clear as crystal...

214
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:34,329
Jack Beauregard, standing alone,
facing the Wild Bunch.

215
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:47,809
Just think of it. You'll be written up
in all the History books!

216
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:51,752
You'll be down on earth
reading them.

217
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:55,189
While I'm up there
playing on a harp.

218
00:38:14,547 --> 00:38:17,573
You shine like a door
of a whorehouse.

219
00:38:17,783 --> 00:38:20,650
A blind man can spot
you 1O miles off.

220
00:38:20,853 --> 00:38:23,014
Well, I like folks to see me.

221
00:38:23,222 --> 00:38:26,316
Maybe folks don't share
your pleasure.

222
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:35,724
Thanks.

223
00:38:35,935 --> 00:38:39,701
But I prefer my own. Lets the
air through. Charms the wits.

224
00:38:44,443 --> 00:38:47,742
It 's just a matter of time before
someone's gonna shoot holes in yours!

225
00:38:59,392 --> 00:39:01,917
Out of the way, shorty!

226
00:39:02,128 --> 00:39:06,224
Or I'll crush you underfoot
like a flee!

227
00:39:09,202 --> 00:39:14,572
You don't look so smart from up here.
I can't hardly see you!

228
00:39:14,774 --> 00:39:17,504
You got the message?

229
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,523
See me better now?

230
00:39:38,731 --> 00:39:41,894
I wish I'd never seen you!

231
00:40:19,805 --> 00:40:22,103
Here's a go!
Anybody else?

232
00:40:22,308 --> 00:40:23,798
Come on!
Anybody else wants to try?

233
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,841
I wanna try.

234
00:40:33,286 --> 00:40:34,878
Have another try.

235
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:36,452
It 's like courting a woman, folks.

236
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:38,715
You give her the glad eye,
she gives you a black eye!

237
00:40:38,924 --> 00:40:41,916
You offer her a beefsteak,
she grinds your meat. Hurry, hurry!

238
00:40:42,128 --> 00:40:46,087
Come on out here and have a try!
Come on now, folks! Get ready!

239
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,792
He's all yours! If you're close
to him, he doesn't swing.

240
00:41:16,162 --> 00:41:21,395
Use your skill to hit their heads!
Let 's see who gets the prize tonight!

241
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,501
He who scores five hits
will get the prize tonight!

242
00:41:24,704 --> 00:41:26,899
Come on, folks!
Give them anything you want!

243
00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:30,733
Three hits for only half a dollar!
Seven for only a dollar!

244
00:41:30,943 --> 00:41:35,971
And for the price of only two dollars,
I'll offer you six, I mean...

245
00:41:36,182 --> 00:41:38,616
six ripe cantaloupes!
And when I say ripe, believe me...

246
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:43,346
...I mean ripe. Come on!
- Let me try it.

247
00:41:43,556 --> 00:41:45,990
Come on!
Move your arms now!

248
00:41:47,193 --> 00:41:49,388
Come on, folks!
Give them what you want!

249
00:41:49,595 --> 00:41:51,586
Close it fast!
Let them thrown!

250
00:41:51,797 --> 00:41:53,697
Come on!
Move your arms now!

251
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,027
Watch your aim!

252
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:58,101
Come on, everybody!
Give them everything you've got.

253
00:41:58,304 --> 00:42:00,795
The fun of the game...

254
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:18,346
What did you say
the fun of the game is?

255
00:42:21,427 --> 00:42:22,724
Son of a bitch!

256
00:42:33,172 --> 00:42:35,299
I'm gonna stay
as long as I like!

257
00:42:35,508 --> 00:42:38,671
I got as much right
as anyone to be here!

258
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:43,472
Sleep tight, grandpa!

259
00:42:43,682 --> 00:42:46,048
You stinky-minding pokeheads!

260
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:49,847
One of these days, the worm is gonna
churn and nip you all right in the butt!

261
00:42:50,055 --> 00:42:52,990
You tell your
stinking boss Sullivan!

262
00:42:56,128 --> 00:42:58,289
Who the hell are you?

263
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,497
I'll take 3 on Squirrel!

264
00:43:06,705 --> 00:43:09,333
Another 1O dollars on Squirrel.

265
00:43:32,164 --> 00:43:33,825
Folks!

266
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,891
Bring them on on Squirrel!

267
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,148
He's a quick shot, folks,
but he can also miss!

268
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:52,817
Come on, now!
This could be your lucky chance!

269
00:44:10,302 --> 00:44:12,566
Hi.

270
00:44:14,707 --> 00:44:17,198
Beer.

271
00:44:27,653 --> 00:44:30,781
- How'd you like to play with this?
- Like that?

272
00:44:35,694 --> 00:44:38,458
Hey, what 's the game?
Can I play too?

273
00:44:38,664 --> 00:44:39,494
Sure.

274
00:44:39,698 --> 00:44:42,030
Anyone can play.

275
00:44:45,905 --> 00:44:50,069
If you can afford it,
if you can shoot...

276
00:44:50,342 --> 00:44:53,175
and if you can drink.

277
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:13,855
Okay, I'll have a go.

278
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,664
- 1O... 2O.
- You know the rules:

279
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:21,362
you gotta hit the glass
before it hits the floor.

280
00:45:21,574 --> 00:45:24,236
Come on, folks! Who'll take me on?
Place your bets.

281
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,978
Who'll take 2 to 1
on the stranger?

282
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:32,344
2 to 1! This is real special!
Any takers? Come on, folks!

283
00:45:35,287 --> 00:45:38,381
Hey, Marshal!
Marshal, here!

284
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:47,057
Can I do with milk?

285
00:45:47,266 --> 00:45:50,133
Okay, 5!
Come on, folks, 5 to 1!

286
00:45:50,336 --> 00:45:53,169
Come on!
Who'll take me on?

287
00:45:53,372 --> 00:45:56,808
Here's 6 for me, marshal!

288
00:46:18,364 --> 00:46:21,356
Lucky skunk!

289
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:21,251
That one got away.

290
00:47:35,107 --> 00:47:36,768
Lucky bastard!

291
00:47:49,988 --> 00:47:52,923
Come on now, 7 to 1!
Who'll take me on?

292
00:48:56,054 --> 00:48:57,783
Lucky shit!

293
00:49:25,651 --> 00:49:26,777
Hold it!

294
00:49:29,121 --> 00:49:31,646
The game is over.

295
00:49:41,266 --> 00:49:43,666
- Lucky...
- That he wasn't aiming at you.

296
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,534
Here you are. 2OO.

297
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,680
Give me a whisky.
These games sure make a man thirsty.

298
00:50:16,101 --> 00:50:19,161
That evens
the score for glasses.

299
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:44,525
Now let 's try pistols.

300
00:50:53,071 --> 00:50:55,733
These upside down pistols
of yours really worry me.

301
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:59,568
Fellows that carry them
like that are bad men.

302
00:51:15,027 --> 00:51:17,052
Clown.

303
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:20,193
- Now you can't miss.
- Smart aleck.

304
00:51:43,422 --> 00:51:45,652
Those like you never
seem to catch on.

305
00:51:45,857 --> 00:51:47,722
It 's actually very simple.

306
00:51:47,926 --> 00:51:50,451
Now pay attention.

307
00:52:01,606 --> 00:52:03,801
Have you?

308
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:13,311
We play for higher
stakes up here.

309
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:18,387
Look who's talking to you.

310
00:52:22,561 --> 00:52:25,359
Why don't you join us?

311
00:52:31,803 --> 00:52:35,068
It ain't nice to shoot
a man in the back.

312
00:53:10,809 --> 00:53:12,572
Is it a game that two can play?

313
00:53:12,778 --> 00:53:15,110
If you know the rules.

314
00:53:19,584 --> 00:53:23,111
For me, every game
has the same rule.

315
00:53:24,489 --> 00:53:25,615
Play to win.

316
00:53:25,824 --> 00:53:28,952
The whole town's gotta
see this game.

317
00:53:29,795 --> 00:53:32,559
Big audience, big take.

318
00:53:36,902 --> 00:53:39,598
Two thousand.

319
00:53:40,772 --> 00:53:41,966
Who's gonna lose this hand?

320
00:53:42,179 --> 00:53:44,545
Loser will be here tomorrow morning.

321
00:53:44,748 --> 00:53:48,309
Name's Jack Beauregard.

322
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:55,957
That 's a name to reckon with.

323
00:53:59,797 --> 00:54:03,028
How much do you reckon?

324
00:54:09,907 --> 00:54:12,307
Five hundred?

325
00:54:14,645 --> 00:54:17,512
A thousand more, perhaps.

326
00:54:17,714 --> 00:54:22,014
I reckon I may never spend
it. Why Jack Beauregard?

327
00:54:24,621 --> 00:54:27,647
Will this do for an answer?

328
00:54:34,865 --> 00:54:39,199
You paid for a front row
seat. Don't miss the show.

329
00:54:39,403 --> 00:54:41,598
I won't.

330
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:47,996
Hey!

331
00:56:32,382 --> 00:56:36,113
That 's only three shots.
You still got one to go.

332
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:45,489
The next one might hit
a couple of inches lower.

333
00:56:56,139 --> 00:56:59,836
Your life is hanging by
a thread, Mr. Beauregard.

334
00:57:00,244 --> 00:57:03,771
Looks like you finally got your
audience, so I guess we can...

335
00:57:03,981 --> 00:57:07,314
...wind up this little story.
- It 's an old story for you.

336
00:57:07,517 --> 00:57:12,147
January '86. Madison.
Same situation, remember?

337
00:57:12,356 --> 00:57:14,916
Except I was facing
three bastards that day.

338
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:17,184
Exactly.

339
00:57:29,006 --> 00:57:33,306
Seems like that hole was just
aching for another bullet.

340
00:57:45,355 --> 00:57:47,619
Remember, boys, when
the spirit is willing...

341
00:57:47,824 --> 00:57:51,419
the flesh has the strength of ten.

342
00:59:54,684 --> 00:59:56,777
- Can I send a telegram?
- Yes, sir.

343
00:59:56,986 --> 01:00:00,615
It will cost you 25 cents a word.

344
01:00:03,026 --> 01:00:06,826
Maritime Company, New Orleans.

345
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:13,629
Request confirmation reservation
Sundowner sailing 12 day. Stop.

346
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:17,999
5OO dollar deposit follow. Stop.

347
01:00:18,641 --> 01:00:20,666
Signed: Jack Beauregard.

348
01:01:28,111 --> 01:01:30,341
Look who's back.

349
01:01:31,314 --> 01:01:34,249
What are you holding
that up there for?

350
01:01:37,654 --> 01:01:40,054
Idiots!

351
01:01:41,891 --> 01:01:44,587
You go catch those two.

352
01:01:46,563 --> 01:01:49,589
He's gone into the corner room.

353
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,261
Come on. Quiet.

354
01:02:05,949 --> 01:02:09,885
Up there. I guess he's asleep.

355
01:02:10,086 --> 01:02:12,350
I heard him setting his alarm clock.

356
01:02:12,555 --> 01:02:15,319
Well, this'll awake him
quicker than any alarm.

357
01:02:18,895 --> 01:02:22,194
He must be right up there.

358
01:02:22,398 --> 01:02:24,628
I'll go.

359
01:02:48,324 --> 01:02:49,916
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn't.

360
01:02:50,126 --> 01:02:53,152
- He must be on the other side.
- I'm here.

361
01:03:02,171 --> 01:03:04,867
- Break a mirror is bad luck.
- Give me a match.

362
01:03:09,379 --> 01:03:10,778
Light it.

363
01:03:22,892 --> 01:03:25,793
Well, it only last one minute.

364
01:03:25,995 --> 01:03:28,759
Light it!

365
01:03:36,339 --> 01:03:41,367
Don't... don't you think
I ought to get down?

366
01:03:42,445 --> 01:03:46,939
People go around wasting
days and weeks and years...

367
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:51,917
and all of a sudden there's
only 3O seconds to go.

368
01:03:52,989 --> 01:03:56,982
No! Wait! I got stuck in!

369
01:03:57,193 --> 01:03:59,218
It stopped.

370
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,525
It happens to everyone,
sooner or later.

371
01:04:12,709 --> 01:04:15,337
Don John, where are you?

372
01:04:15,778 --> 01:04:17,507
I'm here.

373
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,805
Me too.

374
01:04:25,021 --> 01:04:26,852
Wait! Bang!

375
01:04:29,425 --> 01:04:31,052
Thank you, man.

376
01:05:13,836 --> 01:05:17,431
- It 's real funny!
- Nothing funny about death.

377
01:05:22,945 --> 01:05:25,106
Shut up!

378
01:05:26,816 --> 01:05:29,182
There are eight of them!

379
01:05:29,385 --> 01:05:31,785
- Look!
- What a lot of nobody!

380
01:05:31,988 --> 01:05:34,548
Reflection is one and all.
But in truth there's only one.

381
01:05:34,757 --> 01:05:38,921
- Guess which is that son of a gun.
- The third one!

382
01:05:39,395 --> 01:05:41,761
You really are slippin'. Hold this.

383
01:05:41,964 --> 01:05:43,556
Who? Me?

384
01:05:43,766 --> 01:05:44,755
Yes, you!

385
01:05:56,846 --> 01:05:59,474
- Well?
- Well...

386
01:05:59,682 --> 01:06:03,482
Nevada and that other
sneak thief Wayne...

387
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,754
had pulled me out.

388
01:06:07,456 --> 01:06:10,118
For 2OO dollars!

389
01:06:10,326 --> 01:06:15,958
My part was all I had. My share of
the mine for 2OO stinking dollars!

390
01:06:16,165 --> 01:06:19,100
And then the bank shifted.

391
01:06:20,836 --> 01:06:23,737
I got so mad it gave me asthma!

392
01:06:23,939 --> 01:06:26,840
That 's the way I'm forced to live
now. I have to breath this shit!

393
01:06:27,042 --> 01:06:29,636
I don't want to talk no more
about that stinking business.

394
01:06:29,845 --> 01:06:32,279
Ain't no use in persisting!

395
01:06:32,481 --> 01:06:33,948
If you want to persist...

396
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:37,383
you'll have to persist harder!

397
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:56,164
It was Red himself who told me.

398
01:06:56,372 --> 01:06:58,101
The whole story.

399
01:06:58,307 --> 01:07:02,141
That ain't no mine. It 's
just a hole in the ground.

400
01:07:03,112 --> 01:07:06,513
Nobody ain't never gonna
find no gold in there.

401
01:07:06,715 --> 01:07:09,912
That city sleeker. That Sullivan...

402
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:12,815
he wants to buy it for 6OO dollars.

403
01:07:13,022 --> 01:07:14,922
And that ain't hay dough.

404
01:07:15,124 --> 01:07:19,720
But he could live on your
share of it for a year.

405
01:07:19,929 --> 01:07:23,194
That 's what they told me.

406
01:07:42,217 --> 01:07:44,811
- Then what?
- The year run out...

407
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,853
the money run out,
and the liquor run out.

408
01:07:58,367 --> 01:08:00,665
Here, this'll quench your thirst.

409
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:04,600
And cut to the point 'cause
I got no more dough either.

410
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:10,106
Damnation! That mine
began pouring out gold...

411
01:08:10,312 --> 01:08:11,939
like the mine was made of it.

412
01:08:12,147 --> 01:08:14,115
And I say I deserve a share.

413
01:08:14,316 --> 01:08:15,977
At least enough to keep me in liquor.

414
01:08:16,185 --> 01:08:18,653
And what did Red and Nevada do?

415
01:08:19,288 --> 01:08:22,257
They ran off somewhere.
The dirty coyotes!

416
01:08:23,459 --> 01:08:28,158
Red and Nevada are dead. You
can drink to their memory.

417
01:08:31,433 --> 01:08:36,200
It 's like I said, he who lives by
the sword will get nipped in the butt.

418
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:10,089
No, no, no! I surrender!

419
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:50,099
Next time, knock before
you come busting in.

420
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:04,148
Are you playing games?

421
01:11:04,353 --> 01:11:06,150
There'd been a lot of
guys trying to kill me...

422
01:11:06,355 --> 01:11:09,119
just so they can brag about
it for the rest of their lives.

423
01:11:09,324 --> 01:11:11,121
You had your audience this
morning and you had your target.

424
01:11:11,326 --> 01:11:14,193
That kind of opportunity
don't knock twice.

425
01:11:14,396 --> 01:11:18,856
Well, it depends on
your point of view.

426
01:11:20,302 --> 01:11:24,238
- It 's a dangerous game.
- Yeah.

427
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:31,304
It ain't easy to make balls spin.

428
01:11:37,152 --> 01:11:40,644
But even if you do, sooner or later,
they're bound to wind up in the hole.

429
01:11:40,856 --> 01:11:43,848
It 's gone in! It 's gone in!

430
01:11:44,493 --> 01:11:45,755
Missed by a hair!

431
01:11:45,961 --> 01:11:49,089
Fact is you saved my life today.

432
01:11:49,298 --> 01:11:53,291
But I'd rather is my fault I got
shot, than your fault I didn't.

433
01:11:53,502 --> 01:11:55,800
That 's a pile of horse manure, son.

434
01:11:56,004 --> 01:12:00,202
It 's better not to get
shot for nobody's fault.

435
01:12:04,947 --> 01:12:08,508
Why did you blow in these
balls? I don't count.

436
01:12:08,717 --> 01:12:11,481
- I wanted to let out some air.
- While you're letting out all that air...

437
01:12:11,687 --> 01:12:15,248
suppose you tell me why you were
sitting in the street this morning.

438
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:17,948
I got tired of standing.

439
01:12:19,161 --> 01:12:21,652
You keep turning your back to me.

440
01:12:21,863 --> 01:12:28,166
Seems like you trust me too much,
or maybe you trust yourself too much.

441
01:12:28,904 --> 01:12:30,701
You ever heard the story
about the little birdy?

442
01:12:30,906 --> 01:12:32,498
My grandpa used to tell it to me.

443
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:36,075
When I was a boy, man didn't live
long enough to become grandpas.

444
01:12:36,278 --> 01:12:39,247
It wasn't easy, son,
but it could be that.

445
01:12:39,982 --> 01:12:41,847
See?

446
01:12:44,953 --> 01:12:48,286
There was this little birdie who
didn't even know how to fly yet.

447
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:54,395
One freezing cold night, he tumbles
out of his nest, lands on the ground.

448
01:12:54,963 --> 01:12:57,796
well, he starts going...

449
01:12:59,868 --> 01:13:03,497
like crazy 'cause he's
damn nearly freezing!

450
01:13:03,705 --> 01:13:07,038
Lucky for him. Along comes this cow...

451
01:13:07,242 --> 01:13:11,736
sees him, and feels
sorry for him. So...

452
01:13:13,582 --> 01:13:15,846
she lifts her tail...

453
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:22,350
and... drops a steaming
hot cowpat right on him.

454
01:13:22,557 --> 01:13:24,252
The little birdie is
nice and warm again...

455
01:13:24,459 --> 01:13:27,326
but it still ain't
happy and keeps going...

456
01:13:29,665 --> 01:13:32,031
Iouder than ever.

457
01:13:37,072 --> 01:13:41,600
A mean old coyote hears
him and comes on running.

458
01:13:42,311 --> 01:13:44,905
He reaches out a paw...

459
01:13:45,747 --> 01:13:49,239
and pulls him out of the cow pie.

460
01:13:50,952 --> 01:13:53,420
He brushes the dirt
on him real nice...

461
01:13:53,622 --> 01:13:56,022
and then...

462
01:14:03,699 --> 01:14:06,065
swallows the birdie down in one gulp!

463
01:14:06,968 --> 01:14:09,436
Grandpa said there
was a moral there...

464
01:14:09,638 --> 01:14:11,105
but you have to figure
it out for yourself.

465
01:14:11,306 --> 01:14:13,137
Bird...

466
01:14:13,608 --> 01:14:19,911
coyote... cow pie... don't
make no sense to me, not at all.

467
01:14:20,115 --> 01:14:22,140
You still believe in fairy tales.

468
01:14:24,619 --> 01:14:26,746
Yeah.

469
01:14:26,955 --> 01:14:29,480
For example...

470
01:14:29,791 --> 01:14:33,557
this is a good guy who's
gotta avenge his brother.

471
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:38,499
And this is the bad guy...

472
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:43,435
who's gonna get killed because
he shot the good guy's brother.

473
01:14:44,339 --> 01:14:46,239
- And this... - Is
my blue-eyed angel...

474
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:48,500
who protects me from harm.

475
01:14:50,312 --> 01:14:52,280
That 's Nobody.

476
01:14:55,484 --> 01:14:59,511
That leaves you and me face to face.

477
01:15:00,489 --> 01:15:02,582
No.

478
01:15:06,695 --> 01:15:09,095
That leaves you alone...

479
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:12,266
against 15O.

480
01:15:22,544 --> 01:15:25,104
You're sure trying hard
to make a hero out of me.

481
01:15:26,081 --> 01:15:29,517
You're that already. You
just need a special act.

482
01:15:29,718 --> 01:15:32,653
Something to make your name a legend.

483
01:15:32,854 --> 01:15:38,292
What I don't understand is:
what difference it makes to you?

484
01:15:40,996 --> 01:15:44,329
A man who is a man needs
someone to believe in.

485
01:15:53,275 --> 01:15:56,244
I've had all kinds in my life...

486
01:15:58,713 --> 01:16:01,546
thieves and killers...

487
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:04,241
pimps and prostitutes...

488
01:16:04,453 --> 01:16:06,614
con men and preachers.

489
01:16:06,822 --> 01:16:09,848
Even a few fellows
that told the truth.

490
01:16:10,058 --> 01:16:13,027
The kind of man you're
talking about, never.

491
01:16:13,228 --> 01:16:15,196
Maybe you've never met them...

492
01:16:15,397 --> 01:16:19,891
but hardly ever they're
the only ones who count.

493
01:16:28,176 --> 01:16:31,668
Reckon this fellow's name is Sullivan?

494
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:34,979
I reckon it is.

495
01:16:38,153 --> 01:16:39,620
Hey! Hey!

496
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:42,483
He's taking Sullivan away!

497
01:16:42,958 --> 01:16:47,486
But Sullivan is nothing. It 's
the Wild Bunch on the back of him.

498
01:16:47,696 --> 01:16:50,597
We've got to warn that gent fella.

499
01:16:50,799 --> 01:16:52,926
Don't you see? If he kills Sullivan...

500
01:16:53,134 --> 01:16:57,070
he'll have 15O blood thirsty
cutthroats on his tail!

501
01:16:57,272 --> 01:16:58,671
He's gonna make trouble for himself.

502
01:16:58,874 --> 01:17:02,241
No, he's gonna make
a name for himself.

503
01:17:05,614 --> 01:17:09,914
The way he's galloping, he
must be in a hurry to make it.

504
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:17,381
If you kill me, the Wild Bunch will
know that you're on to their game.

505
01:17:27,936 --> 01:17:30,336
They told me, kill him or buy him.

506
01:17:30,539 --> 01:17:33,599
I wouldn't have tried,
unless it was my last chance.

507
01:17:33,909 --> 01:17:37,037
You know what Nevada was like.
We had a little agreement...

508
01:17:37,245 --> 01:17:39,543
him, Red and me, for an
extra share between us.

509
01:17:39,981 --> 01:17:43,417
But you know even better than
me how he hated sharing anything.

510
01:17:44,286 --> 01:17:48,382
And he deserved the
bullet he got. Red did it.

511
01:17:50,525 --> 01:17:52,686
But I kept his share.

512
01:17:53,695 --> 01:17:55,629
And it 's yours now.
Take all you want.

513
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:59,664
You can live like a
king for 1OO years.

514
01:18:01,002 --> 01:18:04,165
I don't intend to get that old.

515
01:18:29,064 --> 01:18:31,555
I only need 5OO.

516
01:18:38,139 --> 01:18:41,575
Is there a telegraph office in town?

517
01:18:41,776 --> 01:18:44,677
- How do I get a train for New Orleans?
- Follow the tracks east of Kimble.

518
01:18:44,879 --> 01:18:47,677
There is a train from
there every Friday.

519
01:19:19,914 --> 01:19:21,905
Disappointed?

520
01:19:23,752 --> 01:19:25,652
Yep.

521
01:19:26,021 --> 01:19:29,149
I thought I could count
on your brotherly feeling.

522
01:19:29,524 --> 01:19:33,551
Beats me how kids like you think
if a man's older than you...

523
01:19:34,329 --> 01:19:37,389
he goes along with old
fashioned notions like...

524
01:19:37,599 --> 01:19:40,363
like "blood is thicker than water".

525
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:42,934
Sure Nevada was my brother...

526
01:19:43,138 --> 01:19:46,471
but he was a grade A skunk
who shot people in the back.

527
01:19:46,675 --> 01:19:49,371
And what 's more, he stole
1O thousand dollars off me.

528
01:19:49,577 --> 01:19:52,205
I ain't risking my life to avenge him.

529
01:19:52,414 --> 01:19:56,214
My, my! How modern the
old folks are becoming!

530
01:19:57,052 --> 01:20:00,544
But a hero can't run
away from his destiny.

531
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:02,848
My destiny is to get
the hell out of here.

532
01:20:03,058 --> 01:20:06,585
I've got an appointment with a
ship that 's sailing for Europe.

533
01:20:06,961 --> 01:20:09,020
Sometimes you run smack
into your destiny...

534
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:12,393
on the very road you
take to get away from it.

535
01:20:12,634 --> 01:20:15,762
If you're still thinking about
the Wild Bunch, forget it.

536
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:18,962
I ain't taking them on.

537
01:20:23,011 --> 01:20:26,003
You will, Jack. You will.

538
01:23:13,281 --> 01:23:14,839
Put it over there.

539
01:27:10,818 --> 01:27:12,217
Hold it!

540
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:15,184
- Where is it going?
- Use your eyes, man.

541
01:27:15,389 --> 01:27:16,651
Ain't it certain?

542
01:27:16,858 --> 01:27:18,120
But...

543
01:27:18,326 --> 01:27:21,124
who's driving it? Who?

544
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:23,893
They've stolen the train!

545
01:29:20,915 --> 01:29:23,349
<i>There's only 150 of them...</i>

546
01:29:23,551 --> 01:29:27,749
<i>but they rlde llke
they were thousands.</i>

547
01:31:13,194 --> 01:31:16,652
<i>A man's gotta quit sometlme.</i>

548
01:31:17,798 --> 01:31:22,098
<i>But someone llke you has
gotta go out with style.</i>

549
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:04,404
<i>Just thlnk of it.</i>

550
01:33:04,605 --> 01:33:09,770
<i>150 pure bred sons of
bitches on horseback...</i>

551
01:33:09,977 --> 01:33:13,708
<i>and you faclng them. Alone.</i>

552
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:19,411
<i>You'll be written up
In all Hlstory books.</i>

553
01:33:23,224 --> 01:33:25,522
<i>And you'll be down
on earth readlng them.</i>

554
01:33:28,229 --> 01:33:31,790
<i>Whlle I'm under it, In my grave.</i>

555
01:35:23,477 --> 01:35:25,741
<i>You shlne llke a door of a whorehouse.</i>

556
01:35:25,946 --> 01:35:27,937
<i>I llke folks to see me.</i>

557
01:36:50,764 --> 01:36:53,358
<i>You'll end In Hlstory.</i>

558
01:36:59,573 --> 01:37:02,701
<i>You'll end In Hlstory.</i>

559
01:37:06,413 --> 01:37:09,280
<i>You'll end In Hlstory.</i>

560
01:37:13,487 --> 01:37:15,250
<i>You'll end In Hlstory.</i>

561
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,458
<i>You'll end In Hlstory!</i>

562
01:40:35,856 --> 01:40:37,551
Well...

563
01:40:38,392 --> 01:40:41,384
now you got me in the History books...

564
01:40:42,029 --> 01:40:45,157
...how do I quit?
- There's only one way.

565
01:40:46,867 --> 01:40:48,960
How's that?

566
01:40:50,837 --> 01:40:53,829
You gotta die.

567
01:41:06,019 --> 01:41:07,850
Where?

568
01:41:09,423 --> 01:41:10,890
Where there's lots of people.

569
01:41:12,459 --> 01:41:14,256
They gonna shoot each other!

570
01:41:14,461 --> 01:41:17,055
Come on! Let 's get out of the way!

571
01:43:45,879 --> 01:43:48,370
I told you your life
was hanging by a thread.

572
01:44:13,273 --> 01:44:14,831
<i>Dear Nobody...</i>

573
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:17,942
<i>dylng Is not the worse thlng
that can happen to a man.</i>

574
01:44:18,145 --> 01:44:23,583
<i>Look at me. I've been dead for3 days
and now I've flnally found my peace.</i>

575
01:44:23,783 --> 01:44:27,184
<i>You used to say that my
llfe was hanglng by a thread.</i>

576
01:44:27,387 --> 01:44:32,086
<i>Maybe so,but I'm afrald that's your
llfe that's hanglng by a thread now.</i>

577
01:44:32,526 --> 01:44:35,017
Well, that 's one.

578
01:44:36,463 --> 01:44:39,227
Let 's get the other!

579
01:44:39,766 --> 01:44:43,702
<i>And there's quite a few people
who'd llke to cut that thread.</i>

580
01:44:43,904 --> 01:44:48,204
<i>Yeah,I guess it's your
way of feellng allve.</i>

581
01:44:48,508 --> 01:44:51,341
<i>You see,it's the whole
dlfference between you and me.</i>

582
01:44:51,545 --> 01:44:54,275
<i>I've always trled to
steer away from trouble...</i>

583
01:44:54,481 --> 01:44:57,746
<i>but you seem to be looklng
for it all the tlme.</i>

584
01:44:57,951 --> 01:45:01,751
<i>But,I must admit,you've been
able to solve your share...</i>

585
01:45:01,955 --> 01:45:04,355
<i>even If you llke others
to take the credit.</i>

586
01:45:04,558 --> 01:45:07,220
<i>Thls way you can remaln a Nobody.</i>

587
01:45:07,427 --> 01:45:11,557
<i>You got it all nlcely flgured out.
But you gambled too blg thls tlme...</i>

588
01:45:11,765 --> 01:45:15,861
<i>and there's too many people who
know you're somebody after all...</i>

589
01:45:16,069 --> 01:45:19,561
<i>and you won't have much tlme
for playlng your funny games.</i>

590
01:45:19,773 --> 01:45:21,434
<i>They'll make llfe harder
and harder foryou...</i>

591
01:45:21,641 --> 01:45:26,374
<i>untll you too meet somebody who
wants to put you down In Hlstory.</i>

592
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:29,606
<i>And so you'll flnd out that the
only way to become a Nobody agaln...</i>

593
01:45:29,816 --> 01:45:32,182
<i>Is to dle.</i>

594
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:38,514
<i>Anyhow, from now on you'll
be walklng In my boots...</i>

595
01:45:38,725 --> 01:45:41,785
<i>and maybe you won't be
laughlng so loud anymore.</i>

596
01:45:41,995 --> 01:45:44,589
<i>But you can stlll do one thlng:</i>

597
01:45:44,798 --> 01:45:46,390
<i>you can preserve a
little of that Illuslon...</i>

598
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:49,034
<i>that made my generatlon tlck.</i>

599
01:45:49,236 --> 01:45:52,000
<i>Maybe you'll do it In
your own funny way but...</i>

600
01:45:52,205 --> 01:45:54,264
<i>we'll be grateful just the same.</i>

601
01:45:55,475 --> 01:45:57,272
<i>'Cause looklng back...</i>

602
01:45:57,477 --> 01:46:01,379
<i>seems to me we were all a
bunch of romantlc fools...</i>

603
01:46:01,581 --> 01:46:03,378
<i>who stlll belleved
that a good plstol...</i>

604
01:46:03,583 --> 01:46:06,984
<i>and qulck showdown
could solve everythlng.</i>

605
01:46:07,454 --> 01:46:08,944
<i>But then the West used to be wlde...</i>

606
01:46:09,155 --> 01:46:11,180
<i>open spaces with lots of elbow room...</i>

607
01:46:11,391 --> 01:46:14,724
<i>when you never ran Into
the same person twlce.</i>

608
01:46:14,928 --> 01:46:17,624
<i>At the tlme you came
along it was changed.</i>

609
01:46:17,831 --> 01:46:19,162
<i>Got small and crowded...</i>

610
01:46:19,366 --> 01:46:22,164
<i>and we kept bumplng on the
same people all the tlme.</i>

611
01:47:10,216 --> 01:47:14,710
<i>But If you're able to run around In
the West peacefully,catchlng flles...</i>

612
01:47:14,921 --> 01:47:18,186
<i>it's only because fellows
llke me were there flrst.</i>

613
01:47:18,391 --> 01:47:22,487
<i>The same fellows you wanna see
written up In Hlstory books.</i>

614
01:47:22,696 --> 01:47:26,564
<i>'Cause people need somethlng
to belleve In,llke you say.</i>

615
01:47:27,167 --> 01:47:30,398
<i>But you won't be able to have
it yourown way much longer...</i>

616
01:47:30,603 --> 01:47:32,901
<i>because the country
aln't the same anymore...</i>

617
01:47:33,106 --> 01:47:37,008
<i>and I'm already feellng
the strange In myself.</i>

618
01:47:37,210 --> 01:47:41,647
<i>But, what's worse,
vlolence has changed too.</i>

619
01:47:41,848 --> 01:47:44,976
<i>It's growlng and got organlzed...</i>

620
01:47:45,185 --> 01:47:49,315
<i>and a good plstol don't
mean a damn thlng anymore.</i>

621
01:47:49,556 --> 01:47:52,116
<i>But I guess you must know all thls...</i>

622
01:47:52,325 --> 01:47:56,193
<i>'cause it's your klnd
of tlme, not mlne.</i>

623
01:47:56,396 --> 01:48:00,025
<i>And I also flgured out the
moral to your grandpa story.</i>

624
01:48:00,233 --> 01:48:03,259
<i>The one about the cow that
coverthe little blrd of cow ple...</i>

625
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:07,600
<i>to keep it warm and then the
coyote hold it out and eat it.</i>

626
01:48:07,741 --> 01:48:10,938
<i>It's the moral of these
new tlmes of yours.</i>

627
01:48:11,144 --> 01:48:15,012
<i>Folks that throw dlrt on you
aren't always trylng to hurt you.</i>

628
01:48:15,215 --> 01:48:19,083
<i>And folks that pull you out of a
jam aren't always trylng to help you.</i>

629
01:48:19,285 --> 01:48:21,014
<i>But the maln polnt Is:</i>

630
01:48:21,221 --> 01:48:25,180
<i>when you're up to your nose
In shit, keep your mouth shut.</i>

631
01:48:37,036 --> 01:48:39,596
<i>Thls Is why people llke me gotta go.</i>

632
01:48:39,806 --> 01:48:42,297
<i>And thls Is why you
faked than gun flght...</i>

633
01:48:42,509 --> 01:48:45,444
<i>to get me out of the West clean.</i>

634
01:48:45,645 --> 01:48:47,875
<i>Anyhow,it's gettlng to
be one more old tlmer.</i>

635
01:48:48,081 --> 01:48:51,915
<i>And the years don't make
wlsdom, they just make old age.</i>

636
01:48:52,118 --> 01:48:56,077
<i>One can be young In years
and be old In hours,llke you.</i>

637
01:48:56,289 --> 01:48:59,588
<i>I guess I'm talklng llke a damn
preacher,but it's your fault.</i>

638
01:48:59,793 --> 01:49:02,853
<i>What can you expect
of a natlonal monument?</i>

639
01:49:03,062 --> 01:49:05,792
<i>Well,keep your mlnd and heart open.</i>

640
01:49:05,999 --> 01:49:08,695
