1
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,397
I bet you ten bucks the steps of
that train don't stop no more than...

2
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,229
_ ...one foot from that line.
_ Show a little respect.

3
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,479
_ Five bucks!
_ Cut it out. We're here for a funeral.

4
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,320
_ Which way is town?
_ Just follow the road. You can't miss it.

5
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,394
You... you know him?

6
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,837
No, but I know that type.
And I don't like it.

7
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,476
What do you suppose
he's doing here?

8
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,194
We'll find out soon enough.

9
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,634
Excuse me.

10
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,832
_ lsn't there anybody else getting off?
_ No, sir.

11
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,152
I guess he ain't coming.
May as well go on with the funeral.

12
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,920
Oh, that's a good way of putting it.

13
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,839
You could've won yourselves
five bucks apiece.

14
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,592
Did anybody else get off that train
besides yourself?

15
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,279
Nope.

16
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,508
_ You know a man name of John Elder?
_ I know of him.

17
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,280
Would you be afraid of him?

18
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,517
No. But you must be.

19
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,675
That's why people hire me. They're
worried about somebody, or scared.

20
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,311
Don't go jumping to any conclusions.

21
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,035
I didn't know that John Elder
was even in these parts.

22
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,196
He probably isn't.

23
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,075
Maybe all you'll have to do to earn
your money is hang around for a while

24
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,669
and then go back on another train.

25
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,876
Look, I don't care what I have to do,
as long as I get paid.

26
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,832
You'll get paid.

27
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,070
Stow your gear in the house.

28
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,828
What are you hiring a gunman for, Pa?

29
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,112
You're too young
to remember John Elder.

30
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,074
_ What've the Elders got to do with us?
_ Not the Elders, just John.

31
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,113
What does he have to do with us?

32
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,552
When he left here,
this ranch belonged to his family.

33
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,435
_ This is our land. We own it, don't we?
_ Of course it is, son.

34
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,430
Sure it is. It's just that he might
want to figure it differently.

35
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,794
And we need this land.

36
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,956
We're gonna keep it.

37
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,509
That's a peculiar way
to dress for a funeral.

38
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,109
Could turn out more than a funeral.

39
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,676
I don't get your point,
as John Elder didn't get off the train.

40
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,155
That doesn't mean he won't show up.

41
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,150
Even so, a man isn't likely to shoot up
his own mother's funeral.

42
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,319
_ Not without good reason.
_ He might think he's got a good reason.

43
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,193
Besides, there's that other one
that got off the train.

44
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,996
Ben, John Elder isn't wanted for
anything around here. Remember that.

45
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,398
He's a gunfighter. That puts him
on one side and me on the other.

46
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,388
And it was you
who told me that in the first place.

47
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,188
Almighty God, we commend the soul

48
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,394
of our dear and pretty sister departed,
Katie Elder, into your care,

49
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,037
as we commit her body to the ground
beside her loved husband.

50
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,199
Katie Elder, a woman beloved of all.

51
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,552
A hard_working, honest woman.

52
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,719
She helped in your work,
O Lord, in a thousand ways.

53
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,072
She was a friend to all,
a comforter to the sick.

54
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,034
She has left this world a little better
for having lived in it.

55
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,913
Those who knew her and loved her

56
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,716
are better for having lived
in the warmth of her understanding.

57
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,595
Katie Elder lived here in Clearwater
for many years.

58
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,519
All of us gathered here today
knew her well.

59
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,159
She raised four sons, John, Tom,
Matt and Bud, the youngest.

60
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,238
She was a woman
who wanted nothing for herself,

61
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,910
wanted only to give
rather than to receive.

62
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,875
She devoted her life
to helping her family, her friends.

63
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,233
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

64
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,958
In the sure and certain belief
in resurrection unto the eternal life.

65
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,039
O God, whose mercies
cannot be numbered,

66
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,710
answer our prayers
on behalf of thy servant's soul...

67
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,755
...and grant her an entrance
into the land of light and joy...

68
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,510
...in the fellowship of thy saints. Amen.

69
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,392
Amen.

70
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,519
You know,
she sold me a blind horse once.

71
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,030
A woman doing that to me.

72
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,152
She really suckered me good.

73
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,475
This is Katie.
She was named after your mother.

74
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,674
She's a handsome baby.

75
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,792
I just thought you would like to know it.

76
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,313
_ One of you missing, ain't there?
_ Yes, sir. John, the oldest.

77
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,159
He moves around a lot.

78
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,478
_ lf there's anything I can do...
_ Thank you, Parson, you done plenty.

79
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,399
Done what? Wrote a few letters?

80
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,512
No, sir, that was
a real nice sermon you gave.

81
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,238
She belonged to have pretty words
spoke over her, and I didn't do it.

82
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,637
I thought you spoke good,
Parson, real good.

83
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,798
Not good enough, not for her.

84
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,553
I don't suppose you'd know that.

85
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,674
_ Billy.
_ Hello, John.

86
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,232
You ought to have better sense
than that, coming up behind a man.

87
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,195
You're as fast as you used to be,
maybe faster.

88
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,235
_ Been getting lots of practice?
_ Still haven't got a newspaper here?

89
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,877
No, but we do have a gossip
about every twenty feet.

90
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,029
Why did you come into town the back
way, John? You figuring on trouble?

91
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,917
There's always somebody looking
for some. Clearwater's no different.

92
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,556
But that's one thing
I don't want, Billy... trouble.

93
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,111
_ How long you planning to stay?
_ I don't know. I just got here.

94
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,438
People usually let you take your hat off
'fore they ask you to leave.

95
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,760
I'm not asking you to leave. I'm just
asking how long you figure to stay.

96
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,997
Is there any reason
why I shouldn't stay?

97
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,556
Yes, as a matter of fact,
there's a couple of reasons.

98
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,756
For one, this ain't your home any more.
You gave that up some years ago.

99
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,392
Go on.

100
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,388
And two,
another man came to town today.

101
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,398
I understand he's real good with a gun.

102
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,559
_ Who is he?
_ I don't know. He's a stranger.

103
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,228
But I understand he hires out.

104
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,789
And three,
I've got myself a young deputy

105
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,231
who's real conscientious about his job.

106
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,751
_ Am I wanted for anything, Billy?
_ No.

107
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,713
_ Then I got a good idea.
_ Yeah?

108
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,630
You send that young deputy over
to run that other fellow out of town.

109
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,719
I guess that'd be one way of doing it.

110
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,674
The only thing is,
he's not wanted for anything, either.

111
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,358
I come to town to see Ma buried,
and to maybe say hello to my brothers.

112
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,836
_ Any objections?
_ No.

113
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,352
_ Fine.
_ You want to see the boys, go that way.

114
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,394
_ You won't have to go through town.
_ The ranch is over there.

115
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,388
Not any more.
Morgan Hastings owns it now.

116
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,470
Kate was living in the Lupin place
when she died.

117
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,995
_ When did that happen, Billy?
_ Your pa was killed six months ago.

118
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,557
_ Who did it?
_ I haven't been able to find out.

119
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,276
John...

120
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,436
Don't do anything foolish.

121
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,358
You've been trying hard
not to tell me something. What is it?

122
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,839
You know that man
that didn't get off the train?

123
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,430
_ The one we're not scared of?
_ What about him?

124
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,996
_ He's back.
_ How do you know it's him?

125
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,354
Big fellow, about six_four,
200 pounds, tough_looking.

126
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,358
If there's any trouble,
make it look like self_defence.

127
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,429
Nobody told me about John Elder
until I got here.

128
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,154
And I ain't about to let him draw first.

129
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,557
You do nothing unless I tell you to.

130
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,752
All right, you tell me.

131
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,191
But I'll handle it my own way.

132
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,031
I knew it! The Elders are going to be
coming, asking how we got the place.

133
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,198
You stick to your bookkeeping.
I'll handle the Elders.

134
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,597
_ It's not going to be easy.
_ Nothing comes easy.

135
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,873
If you want to own a town,
you've got to put out something.

136
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,638
I was so little
when you and John left that...

137
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,832
Is he really as fast with a gun
as everyone says?

138
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,068
When he was a kid, he was the fastest.
I was afraid to be in the same room.

139
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,636
Let me point one thing out.
That work doesn't pay well.

140
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,311
_ I can recommend my line of work.
_ Yeah, larceny.

141
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,080
The hours are better,
and you get shot less.

142
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,910
_ Just the same, I wish he'd showed up.
_ Stop wishing. He's here.

143
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,956
_ John.
_ Matt. Been a long time.

144
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,549
Time ain't made you any prettier.

145
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,309
Tom. It hasn't helped you any, either.

146
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,751
_ Don't tell me this is the kid?
_ I'm almost eighteen!

147
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,872
_ Bud started college this year.
_ How about that?

148
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,312
When I went to school, anybody
got past four plus four is eight, I cried.

149
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,476
Well, Ma want...

150
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,752
Ma said she wanted me to go.

151
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,712
Yeah.

152
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,239
You got here a little late.
We just got back from the funeral.

153
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,639
I was watching from a hill.
Katie wouldn't have wanted any trouble.

154
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,116
Never stopped you before.

155
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,189
_ How did she die?
_ Doc lsdell said she wore herself out.

156
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,916
She had a stroke and couldn't talk.
Then the preacher wrote to you.

157
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,759
I came to see her
about three years ago.

158
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,838
A bit of money
to put into that hardware business.

159
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,996
At least I come back.

160
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,909
It didn't matter too much to Katie.
I never was her favourite.

161
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,275
It seems you two were the only ones
that saw Ma in the last few years.

162
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,314
Like Matt says, I've been away, too.

163
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,398
Yeah, well.

164
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,711
_ ls it true what they say about you?
_ Only the bad things, Bud.

165
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,309
How many men have you killed?

166
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,593
You'd better ask Tom. He seems
to know more about me than I do.

167
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,554
Pretty smart, considering
we haven't met for ten years.

168
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,593
I'm asking you. How many?

169
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,590
_ What did Katie tell you?
_ Not Mom, other people.

170
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,072
_ Howdy, Miss Gordon.
_ Hello, Bud.

171
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,637
Miss Mary runs the boarding house.
These are my brothers...

172
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,116
Hello, Matt. Tom. Hello, John.

173
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,834
It's been a long time.

174
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,518
You're not that skinny little kid that used
to live next door to the Fergusons?

175
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,555
No, I'm the skinny little kid
who lived next door to the Mastersons.

176
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,799
I hate to break in on your grief,
but you'll need some food.

177
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,790
Katie asked me to look in on you,
ifyou came to the funeral.

178
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,912
That's mighty nice of you, ma'am.

179
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,990
I wasn't doing it for you, or any of you.
I'm doing it because Katie asked me to.

180
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,191
She liked that rocker.

181
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,876
She seemed to have confided
a great deal in you, Miss Gordon.

182
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,275
If she'd had her sons around her

183
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,313
she wouldn't
have had to confide in strangers.

184
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,115
She told me what fine men you were,
never forgetting her,

185
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,108
sending her money, helping her
send Bud through school.

186
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,390
She was so proud.

187
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,993
Her tall sons for whom she kept making
up lies so she could hide her shame.

188
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,873
Blamed Texas for taking her sons.

189
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,238
Texas is a woman, she used to say,

190
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,318
a big, wild, beautiful woman.

191
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,832
You raise a kid
to where he's got some size,

192
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,350
and there's Texas
whispering in his ear and smiling,

193
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,279
saying, "Come and have some fun."

194
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,313
"It's hard enough to raise children,"
she'd say.

195
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,752
"But when you've got to fight Texas,
a mother hasn't a chance."

196
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,317
That's why she pushed Bud. She let
Texas beat her with the rest of you.

197
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,911
She was going
to see Bud through college or die.

198
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,475
Well, she died.

199
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,549
Miss Gordon, tell me, why did
she set so much store by this rocker?

200
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,959
Your pa gave it to her. She wouldn't
have swapped it for a diamond ring.

201
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,190
Thanks for being so nice to her.

202
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,872
Nice to her? More like
she was nice to me, or anybody.

203
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,594
She deserved better from her own.

204
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,349
_ Miss Gordon...
_ I see you're still wearing your gun.

205
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,271
Anybody hungry?

206
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,197
I'll bet you ten to one
she's a good cook, too.

207
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,872
I'm glad I didn't bet. I'd have lost.

208
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,153
How did anybody in this family
ever get to college?

209
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,875
I didn't want to go to college.
It was either that or jail.

210
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,833
_ For what?
_ They said I stole a horse.

211
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,794
People are trying to stick me
with things like that all the time.

212
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,117
_ Did you steal it?
_ I rode him, but I didn't steal him.

213
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,713
Ma wouldn't back me up. There
wasn't anything else to do, so I went.

214
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,469
_ You went where?
_ To the School of Mines.

215
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,117
It was September 3rd.
It was a week before school started,

216
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,754
and I clumb Pike's Peak.

217
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,996
_ Why?
_ It was there.

218
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,715
_ You done what to Pike's Peak?
_ I clumb it.

219
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,072
_ You didn't, you climbed it.
_ What's the difference? I got to the top.

220
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,400
_ There ain't no such word as clumb.
_ What about the horse?

221
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,878
She went to a lot of bother to get you
an education. Why don't you use it?

222
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,117
_ Why did you steal the horse?
_ I didn't.

223
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,836
I was in bed, and I heard someone
talking, so I looked out of the window.

224
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,715
And old man Hyselman
was claiming I stole his horse.

225
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,434
A grey horse? What did Katie say?

226
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,633
She was as mad as he was,
told him to go look if he wanted to.

227
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,949
Then he came out of the barn with his
horse, Ma behind him hanging her head.

228
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,673
Then she come in all scared.

229
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,872
_ Ma scared?
_ I never saw her like that before.

230
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,596
She said he was coming back with
the sheriff, and I'd better leave the state.

231
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,510
So I took off my pants, put on a suit
and left on the morning train.

232
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,633
_ That ain't much of a story.
_ I liked it where he changed his pants.

233
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,994
_ It was just starting to get interesting.
_ Very funny, ha_ha!

234
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,595
Funny.

235
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,270
Bud, how long did Ma live here?

236
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,078
We moved over just after Pa died.

237
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,956
Twelve hundred acres of the best land
anywhere. I wonder why she sold.

238
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:40,188
_ A woman couldn't run it by herself.
_ She must have got some money.

239
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,119
Why don't we go to the bank,
split it four ways?

240
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,552
_ Three and a half is more like it.
_ Bud's got to have money for college.

241
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,479
I ain't going to college.
I'm going with him.

242
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,389
There's one thing you're forgetting.
You ain't been invited.

243
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,478
I'd take you,
but I don't know where I'm going.

244
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,231
_ But I ain't going any place I've been.
_ I can take care of myself.

245
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,560
What do you say we settle everything
else first and talk about him later?

246
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,154
We'd better see if she left any debts.

247
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,635
Debts? What debts?

248
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,832
Her funeral for one thing.
Who paid for that?

249
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,430
_ She probably owes at the store, too.
_ That can't be much.

250
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,269
I'm going to Hyselman's.
You and Bud go to Peevey's store.

251
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,359
Matt, you talk to Dr lsdell.
We'll meet at the bank.

252
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,192
Howdy, Bud. You don't look any
different than when you went to college.

253
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,439
I expected him to come back
with a flat hat with a tassel,

254
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,074
wearing glasses and looking smart.

255
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,669
Mr Peevey, you remember
my brother Tom.

256
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,997
Howdy, Tom.
I was sorry to hear about your ma.

257
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,196
I'll miss her as much as I'd miss my own
ma if she went. God spare me the day.

258
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,551
_ We came about Ma's bill.
_ We'd like to settle up.

259
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,150
I think I have it inside. Come right in.

260
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,511
Let me see now. Here it is.

261
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,951
_ How much is that?
_ Six dollars and twenty cents.

262
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,277
I'll cut you for it.
High card, double or nothing.

263
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,558
Hey, Ma? How much for the dresses
Katie Elder made?

264
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,594
_ I thought you paid her.
_ No, I haven't paid for them yet.

265
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,439
The Elder boys are here to settle up.

266
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,395
Four dresses at two fifty,
and two guitar lessons at fifty cents.

267
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,879
Four dresses at two fifty,
and two guitar lessons at fifty cents.

268
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:03,349
That means that I owe you
four dollars and eighty cents.

269
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,198
Your ma took guitar lessons?

270
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,394
Yeah, I figured she could earn a living
playing the guitar in the saloon.

271
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,149
_ Want to hear her?
_ No, thank you. Some other time.

272
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,432
Don't forget your money.

273
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,757
_ Thank you.
_ Drop in any time.

274
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,830
I wish I could tell you that you owed
me a hundred dollars, but you don't.

275
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,318
She came in here one day
with a big grey horse to sell.

276
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,318
She said,
"Henry, go get your grey horse."

277
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,956
They made as pretty a team
as you'd ever see.

278
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,950
So I said, "What's your price, Katie?"
She said, "One funeral."

279
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,118
And I said, "Whose?"

280
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,153
She said, "Mine."
That's the way it was.

281
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,079
Is that the same grey horse
that Bud stole?

282
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,719
You heard about that? We rigged that
up to scare Bud into going to college.

283
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,357
I put that horse in her barn,
and I come back later, yelling,

284
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,155
her screaming back at me
like she meant it.

285
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,158
She was a wise one, your ma.

286
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,715
And my dad,

287
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,629
you buried him, too, didn't you, Henry?

288
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,756
Yeah, high_spirited he was. And he
wasn't a man to back down to anyone.

289
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,350
I remember when he was challenged
by old Thad to a duel.

290
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,074
Your daddy
had the choice of weapons,

291
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,434
and it being the Fourth of July, says
Bass, "I choose Roman candles."

292
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,149
Well, sir,
they stepped off the ten paces,

293
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,193
Iit the Roman candles,
then they started popping.

294
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:53,270
Thad dark as thunder, Bass laughing,
those balls of fire bouncing off him,

295
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,836
him laughing so hard
he was missing Thad by six feet.

296
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,318
Finally, one of those balls of fire
landed in your daddy's pants.

297
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,389
He grabbed his bottom, ran for
the watering trough, sat down in it.

298
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,793
It was the funniest duel I ever saw!

299
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,514
I declare it was.

300
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,473
How did he die, Henry?

301
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,156
From what I could see,
he was shot in the back.

302
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,794
Did anybody try to find out who did it?

303
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,588
I don't know about those things.
You'd better ask Billy, or Ben Latta.

304
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,358
All right, Henry.

305
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,279
I figured he'd go to the bank
and the store.

306
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,358
But what was he doing
at Hyselman's so long?

307
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:06,874
_ Do you want me to ask him?
_ It wouldn't hurt to ask. But just talk.

308
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,033
_ Mr Venner.
_ Come in.

309
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,073
Looks like you were expecting us.

310
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,794
I thought you might stop by.

311
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,633
Yes, sir, we came over
to settle the estate.

312
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,229
Nothing left to settle.

313
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,913
_ Nothing?
_ She didn't leave a dollar.

314
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,112
But she had money last year.
She paid for my schooling.

315
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,790
She must have gotten something
out of the old place.

316
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,959
_ ls that what she told you?
_ I just took it for granted.

317
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,915
_ Where did she get her money?
_ It's a fine time to start worrying.

318
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,113
I watched her struggle for years,
giving guitar lessons for coffee,

319
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,118
sewing that paid for your clothes, Bud.

320
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,790
Never a word out of her,
except to praise you.

321
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,154
Have you looked into her closet,
at her clothes?

322
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:54,037
You'd find one blue dress for winter
and one grey dress for summer.

323
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,313
_ What about the Lupin place?
_ She didn't own the Lupin place.

324
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,150
The bank let her have it
for a roof over her head.

325
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,555
She paid rent.

326
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,834
Katie wouldn't take anything off anybody,
not with her sons sending her money.

327
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,910
If you plan to stay on here,
you'll find that Clearwater's changed.

328
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,918
Big business coming in.

329
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,918
We don't want any bad reputations
around here.

330
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,672
Good day, gentlemen.

331
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,919
Mr Venner, what did she do
with the money from the ranch?

332
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,159
_ I know she wouldn't just give it away.
_ I wouldn't know about that.

333
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,920
_ Do you keep records?
_ We had a fire.

334
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:42,717
I can't remember every transaction.
Good day.

335
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,998
Every transaction, or just this one?

336
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,236
Well...

337
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,072
I'd be obliged
if you'd use the front entrance.

338
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,192
Your time will come
to be carried out the other way.

339
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,029
_ What was John Elder doing in here?
_ Talking.

340
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,674
_ I don't see it's any of your affair.
_ I'm making it my affair.

341
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,553
_ Who are you?
_ Mr Hastings wants to know.

342
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,153
_ He sent me to find out.
_ I don't care who wants to know.

343
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,148
Oh, yes, I can see where
Mr Hastings might be worried

344
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,557
about what I might
be talking about with Johnny Elder.

345
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,469
_ So you tell me, huh?
_ No, I won't. You get out of here.

346
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,514
Hey!

347
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,274
_ You all right?
_ Yeah.

348
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,756
_ Who is he?
_ I've never seen him before.

349
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,999
I think he works for Morgan Hastings.
He asked what we were talking about.

350
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,270
Morgan Hastings?

351
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,029
He moved in and seems bent on
taking over the county.

352
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,231
He owns your ma's old place now.

353
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,629
I came back to ask if you'd see after
Mom's grave, when you have a chance.

354
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,150
I'd be obliged
if you'd keep your money, John.

355
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:10,799
_ Looking after Katie'd be a privilege.
_ Thanks, Henry. Thank you.

356
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,229
Take you that long
to give him a couple of bucks?

357
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,671
_ Let's go take a look at the old place.
_ What for?

358
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,348
Let's say I'm homesick.

359
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,349
Everything sure has changed.

360
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,313
Remember how we'd
fool around in that barn?

361
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,592
I was a kid when you fell
and broke your leg.

362
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,031
You weren't even born.
Besides, I was pushed.

363
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,836
_ Somebody kept pushing me off.
_ That's 'cause you bounced so good.

364
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,910
All the family bragged about how good
you bounced. Let's bounce on down.

365
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,198
_ Howdy.
_ This here is private property.

366
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,313
_ We're looking for Morgan Hastings.
_ That's my father.

367
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,114
But he won't be back all day.

368
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,993
Then maybe you could help us.

369
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,990
You see, this place used to be ours,
and now it's yours.

370
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,829
_ We'd like to ask you some questions.
_ I'm not going to answer.

371
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:49,239
_ You'd better get off this property.
_ Wait a minute. Don't get all riled.

372
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,749
I'm ordering you. Get off this property!

373
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,554
_ Having trouble, Dave?
_ Yeah.

374
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,389
No trouble. I'm John Elder,
and these are my brothers...

375
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,469
_ I told them to leave, and they won't go.
_ That's not strictly true.

376
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,797
I'm not putting up
with more trouble from you.

377
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,279
He worked a fellow over in town, and
now he won't leave this man's property.

378
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,472
Either you're leaving peaceful,
or I'll arrest you.

379
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,070
We wouldn't take too kindly
to being arrested.

380
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,750
That ain't going to
make much difference.

381
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,670
_ See? Now we ain't arrested.
_ You're going to be in serious trouble.

382
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,156
We're going in with you,
straighten this out,

383
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,272
but we ain't going in looking guilty.

384
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,755
Get on your horse.

385
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,235
We'll be back.

386
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,198
Billy. Billy! You got to see this.

387
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,709
Come on, come on!

388
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,669
_ What happened, Ben?
_ He got careless.

389
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,314
They jumped me
at the Hastings' place.

390
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,310
That's why we came in, to straighten
this out. He had no right arresting us.

391
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,752
_ He's wearing a badge.
_ We were just looking for answers.

392
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,910
Next time, it might be an idea to wait
till I tell you to light out after somebody.

393
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,078
All right, you Elders, take off.

394
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,159
_ Go on. I'm going to talk to Billy.
_ I'm going with you.

395
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,678
Billy.

396
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:31,598
Since I got home someone's asking me
to leave or pulling a gun on me.

397
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,268
A gunfighter can't be treated like a hero.

398
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,755
_ I'm no gunfighter!
_ You're his brother.

399
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,316
I know how to handle unfriendly towns.

400
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,036
At Katie's grave you said
the last thing you wanted was trouble.

401
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,950
_ You drive me out, I'll be back.
_ That goes for me, too.

402
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,438
Why didn't you tell us
that Bass was shot in the back?

403
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,633
Does it make any difference
which direction the bullet came from?

404
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,230
Yes, if you're trying to find out
if he was murdered.

405
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,639
_ What do you want to know?
_ What happened to our old place?

406
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,753
_ lf Pa sold it, there'd be money.
_ Not if he gambled it away.

407
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,952
_ ls that what happened?
_ Hastings says so.

408
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,676
I see no reason to doubt him.
He had six witnesses.

409
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,034
Your pa must have been pretty drunk.

410
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,030
He was going to be a better provider
for Katie, win a fortune for her.

411
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,789
_ I don't know how she put up with him.
_ She loved him.

412
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,551
_ That was good enough for her.
_ We all loved him, Billy.

413
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,833
It was just that when he got
to gambling and hitting that bottle...

414
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,511
_ How long after the game was he shot?
_ Same night.

415
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,076
Wouldn't you say
that was a little coincidental?

416
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,829
Even if I did, I couldn't prove it.

417
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,429
_ We can help.
_ I don't need any help.

418
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,996
Isn't it a little late
to be wondering what happened?

419
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:05,228
_ Who shot him, Billy?
_ John, stop digging around.

420
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,193
All it'll get you is trouble.

421
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,192
Trouble.

422
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,278
Hastings.

423
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,193
Miss Gordon, I want to talk to you
about Katie's things.

424
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,312
She didn't have much,
but we'd be pleased,

425
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,957
and I'm sure she'd want you
to have anything of hers that you liked,

426
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,073
Iike maybe the rocking chair,
and things like that.

427
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,990
Why, thank you, John.
I'd like that very much.

428
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,509
Fine. I'll bring them by.

429
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,957
I can't stand a man
that forces himself on a girl

430
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,879
who wouldn't be caught dead with him.

431
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,597
They're sure a fine pair, Mr Hastings.

432
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,870
The finest.

433
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,553
_ Southern hospitality, huh?
_ Sorry, gentlemen.

434
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:31,108
No offence, I was feeling the balance.
Finest duelling pistols ever made.

435
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,357
_ You're two of the Elder boys?
_ That's right.

436
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,350
I'm sorry about your mother.
She was a wonderful woman.

437
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,030
After your father lost the ranch
and passed on,

438
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,074
I offered to pay her for the ranch,
but she wouldn't hear of it.

439
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,990
_ Well, now, why would you do that?
_ Guilt, Mr Elder.

440
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,512
Yes, guilt. I wanted the ranch.
Yes, I needed it.

441
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,518
This town can grow
and become important.

442
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,952
It needs water power for a mill.
The ranch had the water power.

443
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,674
I intended to buy it,
not win it in a card game.

444
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,830
No offence meant, could we see
the paper that transferred the ranch?

445
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,477
Certainly, of course.
You have every right to.

446
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,272
It's right here.

447
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,875
Yes, here it is.

448
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,311
That's where
your father made his mark.

449
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,717
And the signatures
of the other witnesses.

450
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,109
_ You one of these witnesses?
_ Of course.

451
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,029
_ The rest of these work for you?
_ Occasionally.

452
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,676
What was the game
you were playing that night?

453
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,839
_ The game? Blackjack.
_ Blackjack?

454
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,157
_ Are you sure it was blackjack?
_ Of course.

455
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,512
Pa always told us he wouldn't
be caught dead playing blackjack.

456
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,794
Shoot his kids if he saw them playing it.
Thought it was a woman's game.

457
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,436
Mr Hastings,
you know all the people in this town.

458
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,792
Who do you think was the dirty,
stinking rat that killed our pa?

459
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,991
Why ask me?

460
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,634
We aim to find out.

461
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,070
We started playing blackjack with Pa
when we were three or four.

462
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,511
We know that, but Hastings doesn't.

463
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,029
Hey, Bud.

464
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:47,559
"Katie Duane, born Ohio." No date.

465
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,709
"Married Bass Elder,
September 8th, 1850,"

466
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,354
"Clearwater, Texas."

467
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:00,359
_ We'd better keep this.
_ Why? Let's raffle it off.

468
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,313
We'll give half the money
to the parson.

469
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,638
I think we ought
to get her a nice stone for her grave.

470
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,479
A big stone with nice writing on it.

471
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,672
_ What do you call it?
_ A monument. Do you think so, John?

472
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,997
_ She'd like that.
_ Why buy a hunk of stone?

473
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,159
Because there ought to be
something to remember her by.

474
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,636
The Ridders got their mother
an angel with her finger pointing up.

475
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,354
_ At who?
_ Nobody!

476
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,519
_ All right, then, an angel.
_ Does it have to be an angel?

477
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,518
Besides, some kid
shot the angel's finger off,

478
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,439
and it looked like
she was shaking her fist.

479
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,519
_ We'll get a marble lamb!
_ How about a horse?

480
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,110
_ A horse? For a grave?
_ Ma loved horses.

481
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:50,269
How'd you like to have a marble horse
on top of you for the rest of eternity?

482
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,598
_ What's happened to all of us?
_ You said she'd like a monument.

483
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,158
Yeah, but not that kind. She wanted
one of us to amount to something.

484
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,794
She sure drew a flat blank zero!

485
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,393
Not if Bud goes back to school.
That's the kind of monument she wants.

486
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,558
Why me? One of you
go amount to something!

487
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,911
_ It's too late for us.
_ I won't be no monument.

488
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:19,033
I'm going with you. We'll be famous,
like the Dalton brothers.

489
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:24,360
Yeah, they're famous, but they're just
a little bit dead. They were hung!

490
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,917
We keep the book.

491
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,357
Horses!

492
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,879
_ John.
_ Good evening. I brought the things.

493
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,230
Come on in.

494
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,668
_ This is a nice room.
_ Thank you.

495
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,190
How about... right here?

496
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,038
That's fine.

497
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,919
This is very thoughtful of you, John.

498
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,078
Whenever I look at it or sit in it,
I'll think of Katie.

499
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,880
I brought your things back, and...

500
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,834
...also we thought
you should have this.

501
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,953
But it's your family bible. You keep it.

502
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,869
No, a lot of the places that I go
it wouldn't fit in.

503
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:15,551
All right, I'll keep it. But it's yours
whenever you want it back.

504
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,714
These are yours, too.

505
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:31,438
They weren't meant for an outsider,
but Katie wanted me to know about you.

506
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,235
_ I don't mind.
_ You stopped writing so long ago.

507
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,069
She would read your old letters
as if they'd just come.

508
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,555
Then she gave them to me to read.

509
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,752
I don't know how
either of you could read them.

510
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:51,479
_ My handwriting isn't a thing of beauty.
_ But what you wrote was, at first.

511
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,470
Then I began to notice a change.
Your ma never did, but I did.

512
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,468
_ Everybody changes.
_ Not the way you did.

513
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,194
I began hearing things about you.

514
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,029
It wasn't even the same man
who wrote those letters.

515
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,390
You're going to look
for your father's killer?

516
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,276
I sure am. Whoever killed him
probably stole the ranch from Katie.

517
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,439
_ It's the least I can do for her.
_ Why? So you can even a score?

518
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,156
Kill again? Maybe do it in front of Bud
so he can be proud of you?

519
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,238
Don't let Bud worship you
because you're a killer.

520
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:31,230
Katie wanted Bud to go to college,
to make your name stand for something.

521
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,549
I'll be leaving now.

522
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,554
Thank you again for this.

523
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:49,631
Why wouldn't Katie
want me to find Bass' killer?

524
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,038
Because all that means is more killing.
And Katie hated killing.

525
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:18,278
_ How much money you got on you?
_ Me? Where would I get any money?

526
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,190
_ You got five bucks from Peevey.
_ Spend my own money for a drink?

527
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,552
Pa'd come out of his grave
like a scorched cat. Never do that, kid!

528
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,668
_ You just watch. Two whiskeys.
_ Yes, sir.

529
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,514
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

530
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,552
Well, down!

531
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,598
_ Bartender!
_ Yes, sir.

532
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,919
Hey, can a fellow
get a drink on credit around here?

533
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,553
Sorry.

534
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,795
I'll get us another drink!

535
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,709
Beauty! We'll get us a drink
'cause we're going to have a raffle.

536
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,753
_ Raffle what?
_ My eye! My glass eye.

537
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,111
Who'll take a chance
on getting a made_to_order eye?

538
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,551
If you want a drink that bad,
I'll buy you one.

539
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:54,039
But you wouldn't let a man buy you
a drink if you couldn't buy him one back.

540
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:59,189
All right, sports! Fifty cents a chance,
just four bits to win a $22 eye.

541
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,914
I always did want a third eye.

542
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:06,671
_ Are you playing poker or kid games?
_ Kid games! I'm losing money.

543
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,915
_ I'm in.
_ You can look at it, but don't touch it...

544
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,590
_ I'm in!
_ Oh, yeah! Lay that money down.

545
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,355
_ That's nine.
_ I got seven.

546
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,757
Well, that's nine dollars
and fifty cents.

547
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,474
I need one more
to make it ten bucks.

548
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,468
_ There it is. I want that eye.
_ Well, all right!

549
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,228
Let's see. We need nineteen
white chips and one blue one,

550
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,479
because whoever draws the blue chip
is going to be the winner of the eye.

551
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,150
_ Shake them up. Who was the first in?
_ I was.

552
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:48,388
You're entitled to the first draw. Dip in.
Who's going to be the winner of that...?

553
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,917
_ Let's see who's going to win.
_ Get in there.

554
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,518
This tall, good_looking gentleman,
see what you come out with.

555
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,511
Seem to be all white chips.

556
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:08,077
This gentleman took two chances.
You're entitled to two draws.

557
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,511
Dip in and may
Lady Luck smile on you.

558
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,631
He got it!

559
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,958
_ I got it! Give me my eye.
_ It's over there.

560
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,595
I might just have it
made into a stickpin for Sunday.

561
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,554
_ How much would you take for her?
_ I'm going to keep her.

562
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,116
_ I'll give you three dollars.
_ No, I'll keep her for good luck.

563
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,029
There goes my wedding!
My girl saw me with my patch once.

564
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,357
_ She turned away.
_ You look all right to me.

565
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:47,634
Pretend you're a girl, and you can see
it spoils my manly beauty. Right, boys?

566
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,719
_ Sell it back to him.
_ All right, all right, I'll sell her.

567
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,629
_ Five dollars.
_ Split the difference, and I'll buy a drink.

568
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,114
Done.

569
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:02,713
Whiskey for the gentleman,
give me one, and one for the kid.

570
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,753
Aren't you going
to put it back in again?

571
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,191
Put it back in?
It'd be a little crowded in there.

572
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,994
Be a little crowded in there.

573
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,230
Maybe that's funny to you,
but not to me.

574
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:31,434
I say you're a liar and a cheat,
just like your old man.

575
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,516
_ You knew my old man?
_ Well enough. He was a drunk, too.

576
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,551
_ Liar!
_ He's only a kid.

577
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,390
Stay out of this! He thinks he can
ride along on his brother's reputation.

578
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,036
I don't think so much
of his brother, either.

579
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,754
_ He ain't armed!
_ But I am.

580
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,190
_ Stay out of this, Bud.
_ No!

581
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,790
I don't think he's got the nerve.

582
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,275
_ Give him a gun.
_ The boy didn't mean nothing.

583
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,870
He called me a liar.
All I did was tell the truth.

584
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,197
You can take mine, kid.

585
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,479
Go on, pick it up.

586
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,876
I say he comes from a no_good family
that don't have the nerve...

587
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,354
John.

588
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,916
This guy just called Pa
a liar and a drunk!

589
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,079
That invitation to pick up a gun
still hold for Johnny Elder?

590
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,558
You got a chance to prove
you don't think so much of him.

591
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,679
Tom, get him out of here.

592
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,269
_ Not till he eats his words!
_ Tom.

593
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,314
Didn't you hear me?
He called Pa a liar and a drunk.

594
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,799
I reckon that's what he was, kid.

595
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,589
Now, keep him out.

596
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,599
John...

597
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,398
...get out.

598
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,870
Night, boys.

599
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,352
Where you going, mister?

600
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,479
Finish your game.

601
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,277
_ Hey, Bud, ain't you going to eat?
_ No!

602
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,359
How can I when I think of the things
that skunk said about us?

603
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,997
And him, the big gun
everybody's always bragging about,

604
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,749
he slunk lower
than anyone in the place.

605
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,951
_ Shut up.
_ I won't!

606
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,913
Why didn't you let me
do something about it?

607
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,839
He'd have chewed you up
and spit you out.

608
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,952
Your hand wouldn't
have got halfway to that gun.

609
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:31,551
Katie's going to have something
to show for her life.

610
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,149
_ You're going back to school.
_ No, I ain't!

611
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:38,399
Oh, yes, you are,
if I have to carry you there.

612
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,070
_ I won't learn anything!
_ I can't make you do that.

613
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,115
You don't want to tag along with me
after I've muddied the Elders' name.

614
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,880
No, and that's for sure!

615
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,870
This was Ma's, now it's mine. I'm going
to get that guy. Who's coming?

616
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,753
_ You're not going any place.
_ You going to stop me?

617
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,190
You bet I am!

618
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,789
And that's for sure!

619
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:21,591
_ What the hell did you hit me for?
_ You stood there and let him hit me.

620
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,111
I got him, I got him.

621
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,151
I got him!

622
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,476
_ You got him?
_ Yeah!

623
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,870
Stay out of here.

624
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:06,275
_ Howdy.
_ Howdy.

625
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,233
I'm right sorry
I missed the start of that.

626
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,275
_ Doing your spring house-cleaning?
_ We're just getting acquainted.

627
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,153
We haven't seen each other
for some years.

628
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,874
I'm looking for a Mrs Kate Elder.

629
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,436
This is where she lived.
We're her sons.

630
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:28,236
_ She died a few days ago.
_ I am sorry.

631
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,318
_ I extend my sympathy to y'all.
_ Thank you.

632
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:36,275
I never had the pleasure of meeting
Mrs Elder, but I got a letter from her.

633
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,996
Since I had business in Clearwater,
I decided to pay her a visit.

634
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,909
I'm sorry I got here so late.
This is some letter!

635
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,475
Care to read it?

636
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:52,199
"Mr Charlie Bob Striker,
Pecos, Texas."

637
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,311
_ That's you?
_ It is.

638
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,312
This is Matt and Bud and Tom.
And I'm John Elder.

639
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,158
Howdy.

640
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:08,038
"Dear Mr Striker, it has been told to me
that you have a lot too many horses."

641
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,913
"If this is true,
you have my sympathy,"

642
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,908
"as I have been horse poor
myself in the past."

643
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,430
"If you are still
in this predicament in June,"

644
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:23,760
"I may be able to help you out and
take a hundred head off your hands,"

645
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,158
"provided you are
prepared to deal on credit"

646
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,954
"until I can resell them."

647
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:35,676
"I am interested in good sound stock,
but nothing fancy."

648
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,793
"And I would like to hear
your rock_bottom price."

649
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,436
"Yours truly, Kate Elder."

650
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,153
Horse poor?

651
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,190
Sounds like she had more brass
than the Kansas City fire engine.

652
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,597
It struck me funny, and the more
I read it, the funnier it got.

653
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,759
Finally I said to myself,
"Striker, you've done a lot of fool things."

654
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:02,795
"You haven't done any lately, and you're
overdue." I'm sorry I got here too late.

655
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,834
_ You two would've made a lively team.
_ Well, thanks!

656
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:10,271
_ Why don't you come on in?
_ Thank you.

657
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,313
But it'll be a favour to my bad knee
to stay here.

658
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,991
_ It's been nice meeting you.
_ I've got a proposition for you.

659
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,919
I wouldn't blame you
if you turned me down.

660
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,430
_ It wouldn't hurt to hear it.
_ I'd like to take those horses.

661
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,712
I'd run them to Colorado,
sell them to the miners.

662
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,390
But I've got the same trouble
Mom had. No cash.

663
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:36,116
_ I'll give you half the profits.
_ What about the rest of you?

664
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,392
_ You in this, too?
_ We ain't been asked.

665
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,273
_ Are you telling or asking?
_ Asking.

666
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,436
It sounds crazy enough to work.

667
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,108
_ Matt?
_ I want to know one thing.

668
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:51,359
_ Will the money keep him at school?
_ Seems to be the idea.

669
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,916
In that case,
I'll chip in a couple of weeks.

670
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,278
_ Well?
_ You know you almost broke my jaw.

671
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:04,634
I was trying awful hard to. That's what
it seems to take with some people.

672
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,389
_ Well, I guess you made up my mind.
_ How about it?

673
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:16,196
If I was going to do a fool thing for your
mother, I might as well do it for you.

674
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,472
Come to my ranch,
and you can have the horses.

675
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,514
_ When do you want to start?
_ A couple of hours.

676
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,314
Good, I'll be waiting.

677
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,029
Well, come on!

678
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:56,154
It's your move, Billy.

679
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:02,275
Harry, one of these days
I'm going to beat you.

680
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,630
I wish you would.

681
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:09,630
After losing eight games in a row,
I can hardly consider you a challenge.

682
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,239
_ Where have you been all day?
_ The US Marshal's office.

683
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,638
Take a look at this.

684
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,515
Maybe that'll prove
I wasn't jumping to conclusions.

685
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,553
Tom Elder's wanted for murder!

686
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,149
_ What gave you the idea?
_ I did.

687
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,750
He knew enough about Tom Elder
to send me looking.

688
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,589
I figured Tom for a lot of things,
but never murder.

689
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,916
Why not? He's an Elder.

690
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,839
It takes more than a man's name
to make him guilty.

691
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:48,716
_ There's your proof.
_ That doesn't prove he's guilty.

692
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,799
You're working out of hate. That's
why they took your gun the first time.

693
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,232
It seems like
I can't do anything right for you, Billy.

694
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:12,319
Ben, the trouble with you
is you're like an owl.

695
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:17,036
The more light you shine on him,
the less he sees.

696
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:20,152
_ Where are you going?
_ To get Tom Elder.

697
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,590
Not armed like that, you're not.

698
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,918
And go reluctant, not like
you enjoy the idea of using that.

699
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:33,477
_ I'll go myself.
_ They're four of them!

700
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,868
I can count, too, Ben.

701
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,833
Ben's right, Billy. You'll need help.

702
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,473
You figuring on coming with me?

703
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:53,832
Or are you suggesting
I take along that new man you hired?

704
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,793
He's a good hand.

705
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,755
What are you trying to keep the Elders
from finding out, Mr Hastings?

706
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,110
I'm just trying to help.

707
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:09,519
Sure, just trying to put us on the map,
make us all rich.

708
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,837
A man can grow with a town, Billy.

709
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,628
Or die, like Bass Elder.

710
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,191
Ben, you'd better come here.

711
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:32,473
_ What's the matter?
_ Billy's horse just came in, without him.

712
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,513
Let's get a posse together, Harry.

713
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,434
Here.

714
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,312
He's still breathing.

715
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,116
You and Roy take him to Doc lsdell.
Meet us at the river.

716
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,752
Go get 'em!

717
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,358
You were pretty good today, kid,
pretty handy.

718
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:35,109
_ Where did you learn that stuff?
_ Not in college.

719
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:40,394
We're just trying to make you rich and
respectable. You fight us every step.

720
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:44,559
I don't want to be rich and respectable.
I want to be like the rest of you.

721
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,797
_ ls he sassing you again?
_ I don't know what to do with him.

722
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,154
_ Ain't you no respect for your Elders?
_ That ain't funny. I heard it before.

723
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:58,673
Katie would have bloodied our
backsides with a birch for talking back.

724
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,793
Which one of you is man enough
to fill in for Ma?

725
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,831
Oh, no. Oh, no, you wouldn't!
No, hey, no!

726
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,871
Come on!

727
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:36,389
Fellows! I thought I taught you better
than to take a bath with your clothes on.

728
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,036
There's a posse up there.
What do you suppose they're after?

729
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,790
It can't be us. Unless they think
we stole these horses.

730
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,913
_ It's Ben Latta. They must be after us.
_ What are we going to do?

731
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,998
We've done nothing wrong.
We won't act like it.

732
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:36,399
We'll just pick up these horses and start
out like we were just passing through.

733
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,956
There's four of them.
It's the Elders all right.

734
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,429
I told you not to fire! I want 'em alive.

735
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:58,029
_ Bud?
_ I'm all right.

736
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,555
What's this for?

737
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,548
_ Stealing horses is against the law.
_ So is shooting 'em.

738
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:32,389
We got these legal,
and we can prove it.

739
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,195
I don't expect you all
to believe us, but Billy will.

740
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:40,279
_ Then why did you shoot him?
_ Billy's shot?

741
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,072
Shot but not dead.

742
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,916
He'll tell us who did it...

743
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:48,032
...when he tried to bring Tom in.

744
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,876
This doesn't make sense.

745
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:03,835
If we were running away and had shot
Billy, why pick up a herd of horses?

746
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:09,160
_ And bring them through Clearwater?
_ Throw your guns on the ground.

747
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,237
Do as he says.

748
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,152
More killings won't prove anything.

749
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,628
A couple of you tie them up.

750
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,278
_ We've got all them horses.
_ Their owner will find them.

751
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,517
I've got a letter from the owner.

752
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,712
_ That don't do much for Billy.
_ We didn't do it.

753
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,196
Billy was at the Lupin place
when he was shot.

754
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:47,758
_ The Lupin place?
_ Yeah. If they try anything, shoot 'em.

755
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:16,596
I'm making you a present.
You can have all the good deeds.

756
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,631
What good deeds?

757
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:22,435
A good deed for Ma.
Ain't that why we're here?

758
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:27,794
We're here because
you got yourself on a wanted poster.

759
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,992
You make it personal for a man
that's been in a few scrapes himself.

760
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,997
Tell us what happened.

761
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,670
Some bartender got sore
because I was raffling off my eye.

762
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,030
Started banging away at me with a .45.

763
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:42,073
_ I did the only thing I could do.
_ It was self_defence.

764
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,669
Why didn't you stand trial
and clear yourself?

765
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,873
Because it was his town
and I was an outsider.

766
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,994
Look.

767
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,359
_ How's Billy?
_ I don't know.

768
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,593
_ You think we did it, too.
_ I don't know what to think.

769
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,712
If only you'd gone away
after the funeral.

770
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,439
Whiskey. Hate.

771
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:56,389
Seems like everybody in this town's
made up their mind.

772
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:01,071
Go on home, Mary. Stay home.
I don't want you around here.

773
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,471
Billy's dead.

774
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,557
Go on.

775
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,078
Did he say who shot him?

776
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,517
He never opened his mouth
to say you didn't.

777
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,795
_ Get a rope!
_ Let's hang them!

778
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,712
I told you to go home.

779
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:27,798
_ What about that mob?
_ They had a feeling for Billy.

780
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,515
_ Tell them Billy wouldn't lynch a man.
_ Four men.

781
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:36,475
Three men and a boy. How can you
be so sure they're guilty, Ben?

782
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:39,831
They're convinced.
The same that would make up a jury.

783
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:45,114
You arrest them. You don't judge them.
Get the marshal to come here.

784
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,834
Quit telling me how to do my job.

785
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,918
Did you see the way
them people are looking at us?

786
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,395
Yeah, I saw.

787
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,434
And we're getting out of here.

788
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,834
You figure on doing it different?

789
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,311
They come to feed us in the morning,
we'll get the key.

790
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:50,472
_ How's it look?
_ Not good, Judge.

791
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:54,639
_ Better set their trial for in the morning.
_ Pick a jury out of that mob?

792
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,116
It wouldn't be justice. It'd be murder.

793
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:01,755
We got enough of those, Charlie?

794
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:06,590
No, we ain't. Them guns ain't
going to stop no mob, and you know it.

795
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:11,237
_ Do you want to let them in?
_ Don't you talk to me like that!

796
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,910
Me and Billy Wilson never
lost a prisoner, mobs or no mobs.

797
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,033
He broke 'em up, and without no guns,
neither. I seen him do it.

798
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:22,232
But then you ain't no Billy Wilson!

799
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,989
_ He didn't mean anything.
_ Why don't he use his head?

800
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:29,397
If he was a patch on Billy's shirt,

801
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,388
he'd get those boys out of town
before it's too late.

802
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,070
Look out there.
Them's friends of yours until now.

803
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:42,479
But pretty soon you'll be shooting
bullets at 'em. You will.

804
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,592
We'll move 'em.

805
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,270
We'll move them to Laredo
early in the morning.

806
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,311
Tom, somebody's coming!

807
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:41,674
I guess they changed their mind.

808
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,509
Yell out to one of them deputies.
Tell them you're sick.

809
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,999
Are you out of your mind?
You want to get your neck stretched?

810
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,634
_ We're facing it.
_ Not a lynch mob.

811
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,674
We're here because you ran in
New Orleans. We're not running again.

812
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:03,475
_ Katie's not losing this one.
_ We're the ones who're in trouble!

813
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:06,752
_ I suppose she wasn't.
_ She's the same as other mothers.

814
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,475
Her kids didn't turn out the right way.
So what of it?

815
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:14,309
Nobody's making any decisions for me.
I'll make my own.

816
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:20,038
You can buy her an angel or a lamb,
pay her off with a slab of marble.

817
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,835
You can make that decision.
But I'll decide this one.

818
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:29,797
If we all get killed out of this, nobody's
going to run. Katie wins this one.

819
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,115
You're going to Laredo.

820
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:45,199
Make one wrong move, you'll get
the same thing you gave Billy.

821
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,719
Come on!

822
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:17,592
_ Got the shackles ready?
_ All ready.

823
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:22,351
_ All right, you two over here.
_ I don't want to be shackled to him!

824
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,438
Kind of late to be choosy
about your friends.

825
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,232
Get a leg up.

826
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,790
Make sure they're tight.

827
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,590
Raise your right hands.

828
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:59,316
Do you swear to act as deputy sheriffs
and uphold the laws of Texas?

829
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,795
_ Say, "I do."
_ I do.

830
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,716
Get in that wagon.

831
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,552
Once on the bridge, they're all yours.

832
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,991
_ I don't trust them guards.
_ The drivers are on our side.

833
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,512
They've got their stories straight.
"We were ambushed by the Elder gang."

834
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,472
Whoa!

835
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:49,670
_ What are you stopping here for?
_ To rest the horses.

836
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:54,556
_ Ned, what's the matter?
_ Resting the horses.

837
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,830
_ All right...
_ Jump!

838
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,310
Put your hands up, Ben.

839
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:33,155
_ You're wearing a badge.
_ So was Billy. Drop that rifle.

840
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:54,036
_ One gun won't hold them off very long.
_ Ben's got some guns in that rig.

841
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,869
_ Think you can cover us?
_ Three shots worth.

842
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:02,790
_ Can you keep underwater with me?
_ lf I can't, you just hold me under.

843
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,831
Let's go. Come on.

844
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:48,192
I knew you were
going to mob those boys.

845
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,437
Sure you did, Ben.
But they had it coming.

846
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,393
Hold it.

847
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,913
Tom! Tom!
Use the horses to get back.

848
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:33,355
All right. Keep in step
or we'll get tangled and go down.

849
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:02,438
All right, Curley,
this is what you were hired for.

850
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:06,872
I don't want one of them Elders
to get out of here alive. Move!

851
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:10,671
All set?

852
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:40,674
They've got a hold of Ben's guns.
We'll never get them out of there.

853
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:45,158
_ I'd like to blast them out of there.
_ There's dynamite in the gun box.

854
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:07,035
I don't like it.

855
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,272
Too quiet.

856
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,630
Let's get back.

857
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:15,195
Cover me.

858
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,233
Go!

859
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:05,953
Look out!

860
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,751
Matt!

861
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,236
_ John.
_ Let me help you.

862
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:45,159
No, please, l...

863
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:48,591
John... I wish...

864
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:53,109
Maybe Bud...

865
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,673
I... I wish...

866
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,672
Here they come!

867
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,438
I'm hit!

868
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,790
I'm hit. John!

869
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:35,149
John Elder, throw me a gun.
I'll help you.

870
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:38,318
_ Ben's going to help them.
_ Stupid fool!

871
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:41,080
No, Dad. That's Ben!

872
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,238
Come on.

873
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:00,757
_ Hastings is leaving. Let's go.
_ What'll we tell them in town?

874
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:06,239
What Hastings said. We were
ambushed by the Elder gang. Let's go!

875
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:33,357
Let's get out of here
before they come back.

876
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:38,350
_ We're going back to town.
_ They'll kill us the minute we get there!

877
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,790
_ We ain't going to run.
_ I am!

878
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:46,552
How? There's one wagon, and Bud
needs a doctor. I'm taking him back.

879
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,115
I'll get the buckboard.

880
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,556
Get Bud in the barn.

881
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,679
Hold it, Burr.

882
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,439
Go on home. Get out of here.

883
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:56,277
Wait a minute, kid. We're going
to need a doctor. Go get Doc lsdell.

884
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:59,516
Go on, Jeb.

885
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,272
Be quick about it.

886
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:10,269
_ Take off these leg irons. Theirs first.
_ Yes, sir.

887
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,995
_ Where are you going?
_ Doc lsdell's. One of them's hurt.

888
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:16,270
_ What's your hurry?
_ Pa's in there.

889
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,471
Let him go.

890
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,991
That's it, Harry. That's far enough.

891
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:56,115
What do you want?

892
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:59,676
I want you to surrender.
Then I'll let the doctor through.

893
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:02,872
Get the doctor,
or you'll be short of a blacksmith.

894
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:06,231
_ Do what he says, Harry!
_ Not till we see you out here.

895
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:09,512
_ Harry!
_ We can't trust him, Will.

896
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:12,837
We can trust your deputies
to shoot us up.

897
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:16,476
Your gang killed
a lot of good men doing their job.

898
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:22,835
My gang? Then who killed Matt,
shot Bud and blew up the bridge?

899
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,395
What about Billy?

900
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:29,070
How long does it take a man
to ride to Pecos, Harry?

901
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,794
Eight, nine hours.

902
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,551
_ When did you last see Billy?
_ We were playing chess at nine.

903
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:39,832
We can prove we were in Pecos
at nine o'clock.

904
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:44,429
Send for the marshal, Harry.

905
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:48,474
We'll give ourselves up.
But not to you, or anyone in this town.

906
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:52,309
You get that US Marshal from Laredo
and we'll come out.

907
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:56,559
_ How will I get a US Marshal here?
_ I don't know.

908
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:00,514
Telegraph him, or go get him yourself.
But get him.

909
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:10,751
Go on in, Doc.

910
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,317
Over here.

911
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,234
Out.

912
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:55,915
One of them's wounded.

913
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:58,588
I want you men to go home.

914
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,679
Those men are my prisoners
the same as if they were in that jail.

915
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:07,749
The US Marshal will be here. Any man
who starts trouble will answer to him.

916
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:10,394
Now, break it up and go home!

917
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,711
Go on!

918
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:33,513
I've done about all I can for him now.

919
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:39,033
You'd best get him over to
the boarding house as soon as you can.

920
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:09,999
_ John.
_ Yeah?

921
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:13,192
Don't worry about him.
He'll pull through.

922
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:17,552
We'll see he gets raised right,
you and me.

923
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:41,154
What if the marshal gets here first?

924
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:45,273
It's their word against ours. Who'll take
the word of a gunfighter against mine?

925
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:48,597
What if one of those guards
breaks, Pa?

926
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:54,155
Only a weakling breaks.
They won't talk.

927
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,754
Not in here, you idiot.
Do you want to blow us all up?

928
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:08,633
Curley smoked in here.

929
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:13,676
You ain't Curley!

930
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:51,713
John.

931
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:58,310
Dave. He never did
answer any questions for us.

932
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:02,399
_ We've got all the answers we'll get.
_ It's worth a try.

933
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:08,470
You're not going! You step one foot
outside that door and you're dead.

934
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:11,319
You're not going.

935
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:57,597
Did Doc lsdell say anything
about changing the...?

936
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:22,111
You make one move and you're dead!
Do as I say.

937
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:24,117
Back.

938
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:12,314
Move! Move!

939
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:45,873
Right! There's one left for you.
Now, move!

940
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:28,673
Here's a present for you.
Now, get your answers.

941
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:33,158
I'm going to give you
some real good advice, mister.

942
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:35,396
This is no time for lying.

943
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:38,831
_ Who ambushed us?
_ I don't know.

944
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:44,391
_ Answer me. Who killed my brother?
_ I don't know!

945
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:47,319
Talk! You were there when Ben got it.

946
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:51,195
_ Who ambushed us?
_ I don't know. I didn't do anything.

947
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:59,232
When I let you breathe again, you'd
better come up with the right answers!

948
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:07,915
Pa! I didn't tell them.

949
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:12,159
I wasn't going to talk.
I wasn't going to talk.

950
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:15,193
Drop that gun, Hastings.

951
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:20,717
They shot at me. They got
my son Dave in there. Get him out!

952
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:29,230
_ I didn't tell them!
_ Didn't tell them what, Dave?

953
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:33,718
My father, he killed Ben. He killed him.

954
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,558
And my dad?

955
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:41,235
Your father found out
he was being cheated.

956
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:44,750
And Billy kept
getting closer to the truth.

957
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:47,474
Billy, too?

958
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:58,233
John...

959
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:01,995
...give me that gun.

960
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:05,636
I represent the law around here now.
We'll take care of Hastings.

961
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,832
I don't want
any trouble with you, Harry.

962
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:12,396
I wouldn't argue with him.

963
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,110
John.

964
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:00,676
This is something
