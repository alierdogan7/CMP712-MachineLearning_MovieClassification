00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,170
How you feelin'?

4
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,120
Sleepy…

5
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,320
As a man fuckin' should at this hour, 

6
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,480
if you don't mind me sayin'

7
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,290
It's this hour I'm able to see to ya

8
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,640
I understand 

9
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,590
and I'm grateful

10
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:05,381
At least half that 

11
00:02:05,822 --> 00:02:07,891
fuckin' statement's a fuckin' lie

12
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,394
Take it easy, Doc

13
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:20,199
Try and get dressed today

00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:55,600
Oh, yeah? 

18
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:58,450
Well, here's a pistol for whatever your spidery fuckin' name is

19
00:02:58,585 --> 00:02:59,781
Please, do not kill me

20
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:00,641
I'm only messenger

21
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:02,931
Shut the fuck up and read the message!

22
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:38,863
How'd Al answer?

23
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:41,273
He didn't answer at all

24
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:42,191
Good for him

25
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:46,540
Mornin'

26
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:50,000
Mornin'

27
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:51,530
Mornin'. 

28
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:54,090

I don't know any Samuel Fields

00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,830
Valediction is "Nigger General."

33
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:08,310
Gimme that fuckin' thing, 

34
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:11,953
and keep the fuckin' contents to yourself!

35
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:12,393
Trust,

00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:14,661

we live in faith!

John Langrishe, Madam,

39
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:25,072
wishing you good morning on an august occasion

40
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:26,493
Morning

41
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:31,281
Hoping to walk with you a bit. Better to represent my intentions this day than the last

42
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:32,371
All right

43
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:33,511
May I ask your name?

44
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:34,982
Joanie Stubbs

45
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:38,931
I regret having abrupted upon you, Miss Stubbs as you gardened

46
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:42,370
I took you for interested in something you mightn't have been

47
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:43,643
My interest, 

48
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:44,861
to be direct,

49
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:46,853
is in buying your building

50
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:50,723
What do you want to use it for?

51
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:51,501
A theater

52
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:53,860
My troupe will season in this camp

53
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,523
Well, it's a schoolhouse now

54
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,440
And very handsomely appointed for that purpose

55
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:01,292
It was a whorehouse before

56
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:05,670
Anyways, I don't know if I'd want to sell

57
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:07,331
Well, perhaps you'd consider renting

58
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:10,851
Perhaps you'd consider fucking yourself

59
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:33,331
If I was approaching you backwards, Captain,

60
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:35,390
had a mirror to observe your activity,

61
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:37,902
just now I'd be most trepidatious, 

62
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:39,790
for, Johnny,

63
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:43,093
this is a man when acting from behind and advantaged with a weapon,

64
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:45,100
very much to be feared

65
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:47,253
Was just doing my job

66
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:56,353
You don't want to speak like that again to Mr. Hearst

67
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:57,670
Yeah, I do

68
00:05:58,305 --> 00:06:00,503
Do you wanna try to change my fuckin' mind?

69
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:03,322
Not only will I change your mind,

70
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:06,223
I'll rip your whole fucking head off

71
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:15,093
Another fuckin' invite

72
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,641
Fuckin' Hearst must take me for an optimist

73
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:21,202
I'm gonna kill that cocksucker

74
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:23,162
All in good time

75
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:38,883
I'm curious about those tables with the numbers on them

76
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:41,431
Well, they're for gambling on, those

77
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:44,870
Various kinds of games of chance or 

78
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:45,961
different sorts

79
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:47,620
So I imagined

80
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:49,850
I wonder 

81
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:52,372
if this might be convenient time for me to learn?

82
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,533
Leon, uh, 

83
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:58,033
take over supervising for me while I 

84
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,200
give this young lady some private instruction

85
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:02,051
Yes, sir

86
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,601
Supervising now, Sir

87
00:07:04,017 --> 00:07:06,831
This over here is a choice table

88
00:07:07,437 --> 00:07:08,291
Horatio, beat it

89
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,771
Am  I inconveniencing you?

90
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:13,272
Oh

91
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:15,121
damn Chinks

92
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:17,031
They shrunk these pants in the laundry

93
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,701
You ever throw the bones before, Ma'am?

94
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:21,753
I've caught some

95
00:07:22,297 --> 00:07:22,991
Oh

96
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:27,463
these are my personal dice

97
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:29,400
Nice, uh, 

98
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:30,680
fuckin' set

99
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,363
I'm happy and glad to 

100
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:35,152
allow you to learn on 'em

101
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:45,200
Damn chinks

102
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,591
I should cut your salary 20%!

103
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:03,101
Uh

104
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:06,401
Based on time you're absent campaigning

105
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:08,841
Can I make up the hours once I'm beat?

106
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:10,853
Your plans are idiotic

107
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:12,821
You're running for Sheriff 

108
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:14,213
to be a fireman

109
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:16,460
And hope to be a second deputy 

110
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,122
in case they start a fire department

111
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:21,251
Well, that's stupid and I ought to cut your salary

112
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:23,003
You have to, you have to

113
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:27,181
Why not build a fuckin' fire wagon 

114
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,823
that you then rent out to the camp?

115
00:08:31,535 --> 00:08:32,201
If I had money

116
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:34,180
If you had a loan 

117
00:08:34,718 --> 00:08:36,122
for the wagon's makings 

118
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:38,520
and help with the fuckin' carpentry, 

119
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:40,613
would you build the wagon then?

120
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:42,422
Uh, 

121
00:08:43,377 --> 00:08:45,890
I'd  repay you at fuckin' interest, boss

122
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,722
Well, that's the 20%, 

123
00:08:48,377 --> 00:08:51,332
pre-deducted from the makings' purchase

124
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:53,310
We build the fuckin' wagon 

125
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:55,982
then rent it to the camp

126
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:59,160
And don't ever speak of this again

127
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:04,760
A-a-a-and two fuckin' fire hats

128
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:10,221
Nigger General ain't quit drinkin', we know that for fuckin' sure

129
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:12,381
How do we know that?

130
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,753
What you just read to me is a drunkard's question

131
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:19,822
"What is state of affairs in camp with regards to the horse?"

132
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:23,483
Seems to me whatever the state of affairs about the horse is in the camp, 

133
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:26,070
It's a drunkard's decision bringin' the cocksucker back

134
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:28,590
That's on Hostetler, according to the little Nigger General,

135
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:30,203
if you'd understand what you fuckin' read

136
00:09:30,848 --> 00:09:33,001
Hostetler means to bring the horse back

137
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:34,101
Hostetler!

138
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:37,900
"You're right, Jane

139
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:39,850
I'm a fuckin' moron as usual

140
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:42,412
What I should be doin', being as you have no experience,

141
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:45,931
s helping you compose a telegraph back to little Nigger General as requested."

142
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:51,971
Come over here and save yourself 

143
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:53,753
the cost of a wire

144
00:09:58,342 --> 00:09:59,781
Oh, fuck!

145
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,844
What are you lookin' at, huh?

146
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:09,019
think just 'cause I happen to got a peppermint, 

147
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:10,210
it's yours by right?

148
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:15,800
Always possible I'm having a nightmare

149
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:19,562
You greedy, sweet-toothed cocksucker

150
00:10:27,635 --> 00:10:28,433
That's right

151
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:29,881
that's right

152
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,843
You come to take my place away!

153
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:42,232
Oh, Miss Stubbs

154
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:44,202
Take a seat in that cell there till I 

155
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:45,951
square a place away for you

156
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:53,873
I have an offer to sell my place

157
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:55,743
How are you inclined to answer? 

158
00:10:56,815 --> 00:10:58,102
Unless you don't yet know, 

159
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:00,390
if I ain't out of place askin'

160
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:02,680
I told the man to fuck himself

161
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:04,523
Tactics or a 

162
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:05,903
true position?

163
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:07,280
I don't know

164
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:10,422
I don't know, Mr. Utter

165
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:13,692
Why don't I close up for a while?

166
00:11:14,235 --> 00:11:15,183
Oh, please don't

167
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:27,091
Nigger General and Hostetler brung that

168
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:30,381
horse back to camp, got away from 'em and trampled

169
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:31,961
the Sheriff's boy

170
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:33,091
Is that so?

171
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:39,871
Wherever the two of them was,

172
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:43,081
I guess they didn't feel their lives were in enough danger

173
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:45,351
Well, people will do strange things

174
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:47,340
For years at a time

175
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:49,490
Pick any part of my life, for example

176
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,813
It just don't sit well with me

177
00:11:54,945 --> 00:11:56,332
To sell your place, you mean?

178
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,030
But I can't think why I wouldn't

179
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:00,850
What's wrong with whim for a reason?

180
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:03,000
I'll tell you what I like

181
00:12:03,286 --> 00:12:05,760
What I like is knowing these children are learning

182
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:08,930
I like that, and I like watering their garden 

183
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,862
the days they ain't in session

184
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:12,781
The day that school opened,

185
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:14,913
I remember sayin' to Sheriff Bullock 

186
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:18,462
what a nice thing it seemed,

187
00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:21,793
watching them little ones walk off to your place

188
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:23,642
That's what I Goddamn like,

189
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:26,922
imagining them walkin' into it

190
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:30,120
I ain't seen it yet, but 

191
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,500
I'd like to,

192
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:32,862
and when he 

193
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,892
wanted to buy it, all I thought's 

194
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,241
"Now I never will."

195
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,823
Oh God Almighty

196
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:48,330
What  is it, Miss Stubbs?

197
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,090
I wish once I 

198
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:51,920
could… 

199
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:54,163
care for those little ones

200
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,620
Just once instead 

201
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,190
of doin' what I did

202
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,591
Walked in like the past six weeks never fuckin' happened

203
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:13,270
Never fuckin' left the camp

204
00:13:14,037 --> 00:13:17,221
Never  fuckin' abandoned the fuckin' horses to starve, 

205
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:19,320
or die of fuckin' thirst

206
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:21,701
Nigger motherfuckers!

207
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:25,551
Harry, 

208
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:28,460
what the fuck are you waitin' for?!

209
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:33,061
What are you talking about, Steve

210
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:35,673
What I swore up and down was gonna happen,

211
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:37,062
and nobody paid me any heed

212
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:38,972
What happened to me in Utica 

213
00:13:39,356 --> 00:13:42,803
and every other fuckin' place I've ever been in my fuckin' life!

214
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:46,401
The white man bears the nigger's weight 

215
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:50,073
around his neck like a fucking albatross

216
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:52,401
And yet people still ask,

217
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,333
"Well, why is he bent over?! 

218
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,503
And why can he barely fuckin' walk?!"

219
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:03,551
The livery's gone

220
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:06,092
All my labor, 

221
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:08,281
efforts are gone 

222
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:09,613
for naught

223
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:11,222
And they walked in 

224
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:13,921
like they never fucking left,

225
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,880
and they didn't take responsibility 

226
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:19,481
for trampling that white boy!

227
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,800
Nor did they give less 

228
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:23,402
than a flyin' fuck!

229
00:14:33,777 --> 00:14:37,330
And I wonder what the fuckin' parents are gonna say about that too!

230
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:44,833
Why don't you stand down over there, Harry?

231
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:08,082
Many thanks

232
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,862
If you stay in camp long, Sir, 

233
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:15,842
you may have the delightful surprise of meeting your identical twin

234
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:21,221
He has appointed to degrade himself

235
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:24,621
The open question is with whom

236
00:15:31,176 --> 00:15:32,583
Now we'll find out about you

237
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:34,671
What is it?

238
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,513
Or justice for the white man or for your own dead child

239
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:39,793
At the Saloon Number fucking 10!

240
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:42,920
Well, are you coming?

241
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:43,931
Yeah, I'm fucking coming

242
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:51,502
Mrs. Ellsworth

243
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,111
You don't confuse me with Mrs. Bullock?

244
00:16:00,018 --> 00:16:02,253
Well, as far as the conjugal enterprise,

245
00:16:03,037 --> 00:16:05,302
I'll admit often feeling like a schoolboy

246
00:16:05,686 --> 00:16:06,632
Thank you for it

247
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:10,200
Speaking further, 'twixt your mine and now this bank,

248
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:12,380
however much I mayn't be good at it,

249
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,301
I feel I married rather well

250
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:15,843
I put you on notice

251
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:16,661
Want my money,

252
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:18,230
it better be fucking available,

253
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:20,441
day or fucking night

254
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:23,590
Mayn't I draw you a map then in case it's night you want it, 

255
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,050
to lead you to where I live 

256
00:16:25,337 --> 00:16:26,291
so you can wake me?

257
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:27,661
Now fuck you then

258
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:29,791
I ain't depositing

259
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:30,781
Oh no?

260
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:34,640
Oh, say it ain't fuckin' so, you stupid fucking asshole!

261
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:36,243
Now  now now now

262
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:37,940
Now now, fucking what?!

263
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:40,020
Now now, keep your voice down

264
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:41,501
Who the fuck are you anyway?

265
00:16:42,056 --> 00:16:42,453
Sir...

266
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:43,653
Stay out of this

267
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:47,520
Deposits here, if we fucking let you make 'em,

268
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:49,851
are backed by this lady's gold mine

269
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:55,193
So do not confuse her with some paper palace fly-by-night who means "catch me if you can,

270
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:58,940
turn me upside down and whatever falls out of my pants pocket is what's behind my scrip,"

271
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:01,290
when his note says "Full faith and credit."

272
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:03,280
Thank you, Mr. Ellsworth

273
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:09,252
She'd make the uses of money available for people in the camp ain't belligerent cocksuckers

274
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:12,211
Short of following you around with her fucking mine on her back,

275
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:13,782
how else is she supposed to do it?

276
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:14,482
Thank you

277
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:16,512
You're welcome

278
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:17,823
I am Mrs. Ellsworth

279
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:18,381
Ah

280
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:19,463
How do you do?

281
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:24,052
I guess I'll try you out

282
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,112
Our hearts fucking leap with joy

283
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,033
Keep him here

284
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:38,943
Now we'll see if he takes the nigger's word or how they fucking lie

285
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:39,773
Shut up!

286
00:17:42,448 --> 00:17:44,861
Well, give me a drink and it's a deal, Tom

287
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,120
Go on away from here now

288
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:49,800
Ain't nobody trying to keep you

289
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:51,633
Yeah, that's why I come back with you, Hostetler,

290
00:17:51,936 --> 00:17:53,761
to worsen my chances when I try to flee

291
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:03,600
I was coming to find you once I had the horse cleaned

292
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:05,843
This is the horse that hurt your boy

293
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:08,090
We collected him and we brung him back

294
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:09,780
He died

295
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:18,063
The horse escaped in my care,

296
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:21,023
you may hold the boy's dying against me

297
00:18:21,656 --> 00:18:22,921
Hostetler took precautions

298
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,711
We was trying to nut the horse

299
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:25,322
shut up now

300
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:25,972
shut up

301
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:28,981
I collected the horse and brought him back

302
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:30,270
I'm back too

303
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:32,532
You say what you think is right

304
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:36,483
I'm not gonna act against you 

305
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:38,480
for an accident

306
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:43,722
Your boy…

307
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:46,963
I'm as sorry as I can be

308
00:18:48,348 --> 00:18:50,390
I hope you will take that to his mother for me

309
00:18:56,575 --> 00:18:58,202
I'm here to talk about the livery

310
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:00,253
I feel sorry running away from this too

311
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:03,183
It's a shame leaving animals uncared for

312
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:05,982
Wanting not to be killed 

313
00:19:06,737 --> 00:19:08,481
will put you to some difficult choices

314
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,942
Steve's been looking after the place

315
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:14,252
Did damn good at first look

316
00:19:14,908 --> 00:19:17,362
Any chance to keep hell from breaking loose between you?

317
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:19,083
He left out of here shouting and screaming 

318
00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:22,871
off of me saying thanks for looking out

319
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:24,410
I'm asking, Hostetler,

320
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:26,240
far as you go, 

321
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,742
does hell have to break loose?

322
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:30,141
No, 

323
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:32,342
hell don't have to break loose

324
00:19:33,226 --> 00:19:35,881
A colleague of mine, Leon,

325
00:19:36,438 --> 00:19:37,413
out of the Bella Union

326
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:38,663
you might not have noticed him

327
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:41,561
Leon remarks to me after you left,

328
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:46,533
"That young lady had a front porch on her a fella could read a book off of."

329
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,531
You know Leon said that unsolicited

330
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:55,663
It's time to go

331
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,090
In a few days, 

332
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:03,420
we can do this again

333
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:06,691
Uh, Captain will be back at the helm!

334
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:10,200
Mr. Langrishe,

335
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,513
I couldn't possibly 

336
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,271
consider your offer 

337
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:16,413
unless 

338
00:20:16,986 --> 00:20:17,872
you would agree 

339
00:20:18,396 --> 00:20:20,301
to  building a new schoolhouse 

340
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:22,202
at your expense 

341
00:20:22,628 --> 00:20:24,131
for Mrs. Bullock and the children

342
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,791
Well, who could say no to that?

343
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:28,273
Well, what

344
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:31,150
what if Mrs. Bullock doesn't want a change of location?

345
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:35,470
I can't think why she'd prefer teaching in an ex-brothel over 

346
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,663
a place new-built for schooling

347
00:20:38,316 --> 00:20:40,653
People are strange about things, Charlie

348
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:42,561
But if you like, I'll 

349
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:44,290
get her say-so

350
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:47,443
And then I'll speak to Mr. Langrishe

351
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:52,943
Why don't' we talk at the hardware store?

352
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,070
Why don't we talk right here?

353
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:55,960
A 30-minute recess boys

354
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:57,522
No recess on my account

355
00:20:58,787 --> 00:21:01,410
I don't want my getting' fucked to put others to inconvenience

356
00:21:01,737 --> 00:21:02,870
No one's here to fuck you, Steve,

357
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,442
if you'd just quit running your mouth

358
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:10,452
First off, 

359
00:21:11,347 --> 00:21:12,780
I thank you for looking to the livery

360
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:16,303
He'll talk to me through you or he won't get any fucking response

361
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:19,230
I'm grateful for the care you gave the animals

362
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,513
Now you wait 

363
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:23,713
until he translates from ape

364
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:29,453
Don't insult him again

365
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:32,213
You being this kind of neutral Sheriff 

366
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:34,820
is why I'm gonna vote for Harry Manning

367
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:40,943
I want to pay you for your time and your trouble

368
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:42,550
That's it?

369
00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:44,352
Send me on my fucking way?

370
00:21:45,147 --> 00:21:47,002
And if you wanted to work there,

371
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:50,100
I would be willing to keep you on

372
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:53,040
Look at him, gritting his teeth,

373
00:21:53,506 --> 00:21:55,480
holding onto his fucking nose!

374
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:58,601
Don't you do me any fucking favors, Hostetler!

375
00:21:59,087 --> 00:22:02,880
I didn't ask permission of anyone to look after that stock, 

376
00:22:03,276 --> 00:22:05,203
and I'm not gonna start with a fucking nigger!

377
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:07,782
The Sheriff will have your back pay

378
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:10,201
if you come to change your mind

379
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:11,680
Fuck you! 

380
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:16,020
I was answerable to that horse that trampled his boy

381
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:18,692
Camp being stirred up,

382
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:23,651
if I lingered to make my arrangements I don't' think I would have lived to catch that horse

383
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:27,992
Ain't that the purest form or nigger logic?

384
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:29,803
He runs, 

385
00:22:30,255 --> 00:22:31,770
he blames the white man,

386
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:33,513
and then he comes back 

387
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:35,913
and he treats him like dirt!

388
00:22:36,228 --> 00:22:38,241
Hey, when can I start working for you, 

389
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:40,551
you fucking monkey ape?!

390
00:22:41,387 --> 00:22:44,110
Why don't you start jumping up and down and

391
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:46,361
pounding your chest 

392
00:22:46,936 --> 00:22:49,513
and murder a few dozen lice?! 

393
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:51,850
You motherfucker

394
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:54,062
What did you say about my mother?! 

395
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:55,790
You motherfuckers

396
00:22:56,185 --> 00:22:57,710
What did you just say about these people!

397
00:22:57,655 --> 00:22:59,940
You ofay motherfuckers!

398
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:04,570
Put me down until you're ready to kill me or run

399
00:23:05,206 --> 00:23:06,140
You're gonna leave this to me

400
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:07,251
Do you understand?

401
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:08,502
You leave it to me

402
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,953
I came my part and he wouldn't meet me

403
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:11,963
I'll take care of it

404
00:23:12,205 --> 00:23:13,220
Will you let me try? 

405
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:15,991
It's what I want for my son

406
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,063
Put me down now

407
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:18,222
If I do, 

408
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:19,851
it won't be to kill you and I'm not running

409
00:23:20,395 --> 00:23:21,430
So what are we gonna do then?

410
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:22,581
Put me down

411
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,640
I was gonna go to Oregon

412
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:31,482
You let him buy me out fair and I'll fucking go

413
00:23:34,168 --> 00:23:35,562
I'll be at the livery

414
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:47,633
He'll sell to you

415
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:49,141
Do you want to take it on?

416
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:51,062
I don't have the means to purchase it

417
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:53,330
If you had the means at loan

418
00:23:53,468 --> 00:23:55,370
Yes, I'd be willing, very much so

419
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:56,300
No bargain

420
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:58,200
My partner would make the price

421
00:23:58,726 --> 00:24:00,483
You'd say yes or no

422
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:03,463
Yeah, I'm interested, if I had the means at loan

423
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:13,201
What do you think of that?

424
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:14,770
Sheriff Bullock

425
00:24:15,356 --> 00:24:18,371
Trying to broker some settlement between Steve and Hostetler

426
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:19,951
Well I'll find you later then

427
00:24:21,117 --> 00:24:22,530
Be quick, you got me now

428
00:24:24,835 --> 00:24:27,271
Must've been unwelcome to Mrs. Bullock,

429
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:29,001
that horse being brought back

430
00:24:29,525 --> 00:24:31,451
Not wantin' to intrude on her, 

431
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:34,432
Miss Stubbs was having asked me to find out,

432
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:37,161
might I ask you to speak in her stead 

433
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:38,911
as to something I believe 

434
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,930
we both know where she stand on?

435
00:24:41,325 --> 00:24:43,020
Is that your Goddamn idea of quick, Charlie?

436
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:46,521
Miss Stubbs, 

437
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,710
that owns the Chez Ami building 

438
00:24:49,247 --> 00:24:50,531
where Mrs. Bullock teaches, 

439
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:52,721
has got asked to name a price 

440
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:54,101
which she'd sell at

441
00:24:55,057 --> 00:24:58,633
She got stipulations and likes of which I won't bore you with,

442
00:24:59,148 --> 00:25:00,420
but her big worry, 

443
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:03,330
if the buyer on his own nickel 

444
00:25:03,957 --> 00:25:06,623
were to put a new schoolhouse up elsewhere, 

445
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:09,052
would Mrs. Bullock be loathe 

446
00:25:09,395 --> 00:25:10,360
to leave the Chez?

447
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:12,320
Why would she be loathe to leave it?

448
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:15,452
Can I take that as a "no" as if from your wife's own lips?

449
00:25:16,397 --> 00:25:16,822
Yeah

450
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:20,161
Thank you

451
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,793
Sorry to hold you up

452
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:26,510
"Be quick."

453
00:25:27,118 --> 00:25:28,352
Fucking delicate operation

454
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:36,490
Jack

455
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:43,652
One thought he'd engaged a room for you at the other end of the hall

456
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,653
I'm going to it now

457
00:25:55,925 --> 00:25:57,871
Invites me and Tolliver for a chat

458
00:25:57,745 --> 00:25:59,190
What the fuck is in his head?

459
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:01,000
Does he think he broke me?

460
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:05,490
Does this cocksucker think he broke me and now we're at his beck and call?

461
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:07,671
Oh, Jesus Christ, get your head off it

462
00:26:08,215 --> 00:26:11,712
Get your fucking head off it for all the fucking good you're doing down there

463
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:12,702
That's all I need:

464
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:15,842
At a perfect juncture you to alter your action and forget your previous method

465
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:18,793
I didn't alter my action

466
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:19,782
No?

467
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,061
is my dick in your mouth?

468
00:26:23,888 --> 00:26:25,050
Do I have a hard-on? 

469
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:27,330
Then you change your action

470
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:29,120
Go back to your previous fucking method

471
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:34,252
Hmm

472
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:40,053
Does he construe my forbearance as weakness is that what the fuck nags at me?

473
00:26:40,907 --> 00:26:41,662
Or my 

474
00:26:42,395 --> 00:26:46,140
considerations of alternatives for being fucking intimidated

475
00:26:46,126 --> 00:26:48,271
because the time's coming he sees what I'm up to 

476
00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:50,642
beyond any fucking mistake,

477
00:26:51,088 --> 00:26:52,251
and I only hope you don't doubt it

478
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:53,880
Huh, you see?!

479
00:26:54,595 --> 00:26:57,650
Y-y-y-you don't think that counts as altering your action?

480
00:26:57,928 --> 00:26:59,670
You would change your entire fucking mouth pattern

481
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:01,141
Sorry

482
00:27:01,505 --> 00:27:02,003
Sorry?

483
00:27:02,357 --> 00:27:03,232
Oh, I guess that's okay then

484
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:05,152
because my goal 

485
00:27:05,945 --> 00:27:09,183
before my meeting wasn't to come and clear my fucking head,

486
00:27:09,698 --> 00:27:11,513
not so much as to hear you say you're sorry,

487
00:27:11,905 --> 00:27:12,800
you stupid fucking mutt

488
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:14,522
Should I go?

489
00:27:14,856 --> 00:27:15,121
No

490
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:19,450
Tell me who you want in the election

491
00:27:20,186 --> 00:27:22,800
Star for Mayor and Harry Manning for Sheriff

492
00:27:23,035 --> 00:27:26,312
Star for Mayor and Bullock for fucking Sheriff

493
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:28,592
Bullock yells at you

494
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:32,192
Get out

495
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:35,320
Shut up and get out

496
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:47,712
Does he think I'm fucking afraid?

497
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:58,100
Young man

498
00:27:58,556 --> 00:27:58,961
Jack

499
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:03,370
Less throb today, one hopes, in the phantom digit

500
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,730
Not to fucking mention elsewhere, huh?

501
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:10,423
Might I ask you what you know of a Miss Stubbs that owns the Chez Ami?

502
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:11,602
Whoremistress

503
00:28:11,946 --> 00:28:13,302
Not presently active, I'm told

504
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,823
Hearst's geologist killed three of her girls

505
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:21,223
The three he didn't she hid under canvas and spirited out of camp

506
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:23,190
Now lets her place as a schoolhouse

507
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:24,352
My impression,

508
00:28:24,598 --> 00:28:25,430
she donates it

509
00:28:26,186 --> 00:28:28,012
To cleanse the camp's idea of her?

510
00:28:28,928 --> 00:28:31,941
Would that base her turning away a theater type's offer to buy? 

511
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:33,450
Wouldn't enter into it

512
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:36,371
Cares for a gut-shot shitbird no one in camp has time for,

513
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,941
nor she has any love for either

514
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:38,952
Loyal, see?

515
00:28:39,258 --> 00:28:39,772
That type

516
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:43,293
Some sentimentality do you suppose, 

517
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:44,681
about the building itself?

518
00:28:45,277 --> 00:28:47,211
Might that account for her holding on?

519
00:28:48,657 --> 00:28:49,471
I wouldn't know, Jack

520
00:28:49,705 --> 00:28:50,161
She's all right

521
00:28:52,836 --> 00:28:54,232
Must think I'm a fucking dog, 

522
00:28:54,845 --> 00:28:55,763
forgives the blow, 

523
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:57,550
first friendly scratch of the ear

524
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:02,411
Invites me back to his rooms, fucking Hearst

525
00:29:03,947 --> 00:29:04,662
Shall I accompany 

526
00:29:05,428 --> 00:29:06,252
as your second?

527
00:29:07,437 --> 00:29:08,960
My obvious unsuitability 

528
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:10,161
might confuse him

529
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:12,870
Do survive

530
00:29:25,706 --> 00:29:26,163
E.B

531
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,402
The titans gather

532
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:30,572
Swearengen

533
00:29:31,348 --> 00:29:31,942
Tolliver

534
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:34,212
Do we now assault Olympus?

535
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:35,242
Quiet, E.B

536
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:46,141
I think Cochran's a lunger

537
00:29:47,658 --> 00:29:49,471
Bit motley ourselves, huh?

538
00:29:56,766 --> 00:29:57,933
What would you make that livery worth?

539
00:29:58,756 --> 00:29:59,671
I'd have to look into it

540
00:29:59,896 --> 00:30:00,453
I need a figure now

541
00:30:01,128 --> 00:30:01,701
1200

542
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:03,712
if you made me say without investigating

543
00:30:09,837 --> 00:30:11,013
Laying by for the future

544
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:13,361
Very forward looking

545
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:14,362
Oh, I'm keen-eyed

546
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:16,560
Ahead and behind

547
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,271
Your mark would go there

548
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,262
I'll sign my names, Mrs. Garret

549
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:27,011
I've been lettered since I was 12

550
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:30,901
Since you can read,

551
00:30:31,235 --> 00:30:32,953
you may wish to examine my nameplate

552
00:30:36,296 --> 00:30:37,372
Mrs. Ellsworth, I'm

553
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:39,032
I'm very sorry and 

554
00:30:39,697 --> 00:30:40,892
very very apologetic

555
00:30:44,728 --> 00:30:47,760
Perhaps you would finish signing over there while I tend to Mr. Bullock

556
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:49,291
Opened an account

557
00:30:52,245 --> 00:30:52,893
Mr. Bullock

558
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:54,932
I'd like that drunk Steve to have a loan

559
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:56,883
$1200, title to the livery as collateral

560
00:30:57,185 --> 00:30:58,381
I'll cosign the note

561
00:30:59,456 --> 00:31:00,753
Has Steve clear title?

562
00:31:00,965 --> 00:31:01,362
He will 

563
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:03,112
once he's bought out Hostetler

564
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:07,321
That's what the money's for

565
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:14,582
What is Steve-the-Drunk's surname? 

566
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:16,301
Fields

567
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:20,122
$1200, Trixie,

568
00:31:20,928 --> 00:31:23,180
payable to a Mr. Steve Fields 

569
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:27,362
upon his signature and submission of title to the livery,

570
00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:28,972
Mr. Bullock to cosign

571
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:30,822
All right

572
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:32,862
Thank you

573
00:31:51,557 --> 00:31:53,960
My back's in frank rebellion

574
00:31:54,585 --> 00:31:55,921
Uh, gentlemen,

575
00:31:56,298 --> 00:31:58,222
will you mind if I keep to this angles?

576
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:02,630
Hang upside down from the ceiling for all of me

577
00:32:03,498 --> 00:32:04,511
It may come to that

578
00:32:05,268 --> 00:32:08,002
Mr. Swearengen, I will take your silence for assent

579
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,310
We pass another milestone

580
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,203
Bank of Deadwood opens its doors

581
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:17,112
Is not Mrs. Ellsworth a dynamo?

582
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:19,263
Let's find one and send it to her

583
00:32:19,776 --> 00:32:20,603
What's the occasion?

584
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:21,852
I have my physician to see

585
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:25,321
How are you indisposed, Mr. Swearengen?

586
00:32:26,418 --> 00:32:27,861
Sick at the stomach

587
00:32:28,258 --> 00:32:29,851
Would you wish to leave now? 

588
00:32:30,196 --> 00:32:32,381
Mr. Tolliver can report our conversation

589
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,382
Tough it out, Al,

590
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:37,603
like me that's guts is more outside his pants than in

591
00:32:38,027 --> 00:32:38,972
The occasion?

592
00:32:39,655 --> 00:32:42,882
The camp comes to such an hour I'd have us reach a new understanding

593
00:32:43,407 --> 00:32:44,652
The "hour" meaning elections

594
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:46,993
I am given pause by the 

595
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:48,641
quality of…

596
00:32:50,787 --> 00:32:52,792
certain of the likely victors

597
00:32:53,878 --> 00:32:55,122
But I have 

598
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:57,342
come to believe as well that 

599
00:32:57,798 --> 00:32:59,703
my temperament ill suits me for 

600
00:33:00,098 --> 00:33:02,350
environments such as this one must become

601
00:33:03,196 --> 00:33:06,723
And other opportunities presenting themselves elsewhere,

602
00:33:07,095 --> 00:33:11,782
I may best serve my own interests here by standing at some remove

603
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:13,100
Are you leaving?

604
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:16,083
Can you say it straight out before I have a fucking birthday?

605
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:17,451
I will be coming and going,

606
00:33:17,716 --> 00:33:18,560
is that straight out enough?

607
00:33:19,126 --> 00:33:20,413
What's the task you'd give us?

608
00:33:21,577 --> 00:33:23,313
And what's our fuckin' piece for doing 'em?

609
00:33:23,637 --> 00:33:24,180
Al

610
00:33:24,475 --> 00:33:24,952
Shut up

611
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:29,862
To not let become over-onerous my interests encounter 

612
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:33,511
with the camp's retrogressive elements

613
00:33:33,956 --> 00:33:35,691
Meaning what, you phony bastard?

614
00:33:36,456 --> 00:33:37,220
Who do we kill?

615
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:37,932
What's our pay?

616
00:33:38,376 --> 00:33:39,993
It ain't fair to make it that simple, Al

617
00:33:40,247 --> 00:33:40,822
Fuck you

618
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:42,561
He took the pick to me simple enough

619
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,803
We will get to numbers quickly once we've agreed in principle

620
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:49,213
Numbers are the only principle I believe in,

621
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:51,081
and naming what the numbers buy

622
00:33:51,187 --> 00:33:51,813
when you and him 

623
00:33:52,588 --> 00:33:53,240
come to 'em,

624
00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:55,953
tell fucking Adams and he'll bring you my reply later

625
00:33:56,475 --> 00:33:57,053
Him and me,

626
00:33:58,556 --> 00:33:59,922
we've had our last word

627
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,262
What have the Gods decreed?

628
00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:10,113
Too fearful and upset to relive it, E.B

629
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:15,823
We do agree in principle?

630
00:34:16,236 --> 00:34:17,002
Oh, Yes, Sir

631
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:20,382
Numbers and acts is what's left to discuss

632
00:34:20,798 --> 00:34:22,503
Sounds like a Bible study, don't it?

633
00:34:25,217 --> 00:34:26,311
Charlie read me the telegram,

634
00:34:26,658 --> 00:34:27,792
then I seen 'em come into camp

635
00:34:28,508 --> 00:34:29,741
My exact fucking thought,

636
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:30,623
"Look, Jane, 

637
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:33,333
two dead Niggers leading a dead fucking horse."

638
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,173
Matter came to rope,

639
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,362
Steve the drunk to cinch the noose

640
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:39,332
Charlie's right for the first time in months

641
00:34:40,618 --> 00:34:41,660
Fucking Steve

642
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:46,722
The exact type malicious cocksucker tars every fucking drunk with his brush

643
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:48,410
Anyway, 

644
00:34:48,865 --> 00:34:50,452
here's Trixie with the loan documents

645
00:34:52,178 --> 00:34:53,241
This succeeds, Bullock, 

646
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:54,860
what you're trying to work out here,

647
00:34:55,105 --> 00:34:57,760
I will doff hat to you and no fucking mistake

648
00:34:59,345 --> 00:35:00,903
Just don't let her take off her boots

649
00:35:07,257 --> 00:35:09,591
Did you know Miss Stubbs might sell her place?

650
00:35:13,185 --> 00:35:14,502
You gotta fucking sign

651
00:35:27,398 --> 00:35:29,262
Lot of shitbags hang around a bank

652
00:35:30,868 --> 00:35:31,980
Did you ever fucking notice? 

653
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:40,260
Asshole

654
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,251
Trailing clouds of glory

655
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:51,651
Do you read wordsworth?

656
00:35:52,258 --> 00:35:53,090
I do not, Madam, no

657
00:35:53,936 --> 00:35:55,010
How do you come to ask?

658
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:57,013
You've just quoted him

659
00:35:57,397 --> 00:35:59,740
Well, I have a digest from which I memorize,

660
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:01,500
suppressing the authors' names

661
00:36:02,108 --> 00:36:03,242
Enjoy your supper

662
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:05,641
When 

663
00:36:06,186 --> 00:36:09,450
will I raise courage to search that woman's room?

664
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:10,902
Thank you

665
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:11,783
My pleasure

666
00:36:14,398 --> 00:36:15,892
Don't look to take her order

667
00:36:16,398 --> 00:36:18,862
She likes to draw awhile before she eats

668
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:22,360
"Bone weary but soldering on."

669
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:24,911
Bellegarde as a soldier?

670
00:36:25,638 --> 00:36:27,972
He is an actor after all

671
00:36:28,558 --> 00:36:33,233
But unless you would build a new schoolhouse for Mrs. Bullock to teach the camp's children in,

672
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:37,002
I couldn't even begin to entertain the idea of a sale

673
00:36:37,538 --> 00:36:41,702
The most natural and constructive of stipulations, Miss Stubbs

674
00:36:42,628 --> 00:36:44,982
At your expense, I hope you understand

675
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:45,983
I do

676
00:36:46,556 --> 00:36:47,973
And may I submit to you now

677
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:49,833
my offer?

678
00:36:50,305 --> 00:36:51,011
Please do

679
00:36:56,158 --> 00:36:57,062
Very generous

680
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:58,543
Thank you

681
00:36:59,397 --> 00:37:00,542
We've an agreement?

682
00:37:02,856 --> 00:37:04,062
Far as the schoolhouse…

683
00:37:05,508 --> 00:37:06,220
and its costs?

684
00:37:06,888 --> 00:37:08,021
Absolutely separate,

685
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:10,591
my obligation in that regard

686
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:12,333
Those'd be exclusive

687
00:37:12,746 --> 00:37:13,713
Exactly

688
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:17,061
They come to an understanding

689
00:37:17,627 --> 00:37:19,383
She seems quite thin

690
00:37:23,247 --> 00:37:24,962
Might be where he first went wrong,

691
00:37:25,357 --> 00:37:26,903
learning to read and cipher

692
00:37:27,677 --> 00:37:28,932
Why ain't he sign first?

693
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:30,390
Why ain't I half a foot taller?

694
00:37:30,705 --> 00:37:31,690
You're who I came to first

695
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:33,993
Order's right and amount is fair

696
00:37:35,095 --> 00:37:37,803
And once Steve signs, then I will

697
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:40,263
I'm not a Goddamn errand boy, Hostetler,

698
00:37:40,836 --> 00:37:42,772
to mule this thing back and forth

699
00:37:43,165 --> 00:37:43,910
Give it to me

700
00:37:44,135 --> 00:37:44,970
Let me forge Steve's name

701
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:49,582
I ain't gonna be first to sign and look a cunt when he don't

702
00:37:57,906 --> 00:38:00,493
Nigger, nigger, nigger

703
00:38:12,138 --> 00:38:13,320
Where the fuck have you been?

704
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,583
I was looking for someone whose name you told me never to say again

705
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:19,000
Amongst further instructions including 

706
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:21,533
not to look for him when he's fucking disappeared

707
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:23,293
Well, I held off saying where I was

708
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:25,180
I can repose 

709
00:38:25,898 --> 00:38:28,903
no truth in someone who traffics with that type douche bag

710
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,052
I don't think Hawkeye's a douche bag

711
00:38:33,388 --> 00:38:35,283
Who you believe you can salvage, Adams,

712
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:37,101
is the douche bag you must avoid,

713
00:38:37,555 --> 00:38:40,482
and no effort of yours can preclude some point past help

714
00:38:41,298 --> 00:38:43,061
And you yourself, being his consort,

715
00:38:43,796 --> 00:38:44,810
in similar fucking straights

716
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:47,503
And all the energies I've poured into you gone for naught

717
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:51,453
I vow on the fucking subject I find you dead 'cause of him,

718
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:55,530
I'll kick your corpse in the ear for the waste of my fucking time

719
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,230
Anyways, what'd you want?

720
00:38:59,945 --> 00:39:02,952
I've named you to represent me in my dealings with fucking Hearst

721
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:04,761
Tolliver too, in that connection

722
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:06,760
With Tolliver in connection with Hearst?

723
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:09,321
As he's put us in tandem, fucking Hearst

724
00:39:10,185 --> 00:39:11,173
You and Tolliver?

725
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:13,430
If I sought an echo, Adams,

726
00:39:13,817 --> 00:39:15,353
I'd now be addressing a fucking mountain

727
00:39:18,876 --> 00:39:20,461
I'm in waters I don't know, 

728
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:22,801
nor soundings I can take

729
00:39:23,388 --> 00:39:24,743
To bring me the knowledge I need,

730
00:39:25,105 --> 00:39:27,261
my second needs to seem capable of disloyalty

731
00:39:28,095 --> 00:39:29,711
If that's supposed to be a compliment, thanks

732
00:39:30,336 --> 00:39:30,901
Get the fuck out

733
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,803
Out out

734
00:39:32,696 --> 00:39:32,921
Go

735
00:39:33,447 --> 00:39:33,733
Get out

736
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:36,833
Which is to say, being loyal,

737
00:39:37,185 --> 00:39:38,840
he can forego loyalty's display

738
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:42,753
Like not searching out a friend who don't want to be found

739
00:39:43,426 --> 00:39:45,452
Just hoping he makes his way back, hmm?

740
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:51,461
How's Dan gonna take your choosing me?

741
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:53,863
That's my fucking problem to deal with

742
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:57,112
Jack, how'd it go with that place?

743
00:39:57,805 --> 00:40:02,933
One has agreed beyond purchase to construct a new schoolhouse elsewhere

744
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:04,543
That should go up prior, 

745
00:40:04,826 --> 00:40:06,310
not to interrupt the fucking teacher

746
00:40:07,026 --> 00:40:09,401
Your law-giving tone is noted

747
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:16,210
Lovely smile

748
00:40:19,908 --> 00:40:20,561
She 

749
00:40:20,987 --> 00:40:21,440
sucks 

750
00:40:21,768 --> 00:40:22,193
my prick

751
00:40:23,076 --> 00:40:25,081
Her methods deserted her completely

752
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:28,801
Might 

753
00:40:29,408 --> 00:40:30,240
varying 

754
00:40:30,857 --> 00:40:31,693
the hour 

755
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:34,151
produce a different outcome?

756
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:35,460
What's the hour's relevance?

757
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:37,742
It's her technique's fuckin' awry

758
00:40:40,177 --> 00:40:40,710
Anyway, Jack,

759
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,043
gotta get my ear pissed in

760
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:43,360
I'm glad about your place

761
00:40:43,687 --> 00:40:44,541
Thank you, young man

762
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:45,720
Glad you're still amongst us

763
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:50,293
Nor, one imagines,

764
00:40:50,835 --> 00:40:54,380
is the local creek rife with oysters

765
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:57,142
I'm onboard, Bullock

766
00:40:58,128 --> 00:41:00,563
And you are looking at a grateful man,

767
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:05,270
and who ain't appreciated you previous the way he does now

768
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:06,201
Sign

769
00:41:06,905 --> 00:41:09,480
We've accomplished something here today!

770
00:41:09,955 --> 00:41:12,261
Take this agreement and this pen,

771
00:41:14,135 --> 00:41:18,652
Go over to that livery and get that Nigger's signature

772
00:41:18,957 --> 00:41:19,420
I will

773
00:41:19,986 --> 00:41:21,481
Sign the fucking thing first

774
00:41:21,996 --> 00:41:26,461
Let's not lose our sense of proportion this late phase in the process

775
00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:31,303
Sign it!

776
00:41:34,276 --> 00:41:38,110
The Nigger signs and then I'll accept

777
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:47,822
You know you hurt my feelings

778
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,483
Dan

779
00:41:49,227 --> 00:41:51,070
That's the long and short of it, Al

780
00:41:51,537 --> 00:41:52,952
You fucking pick Adams to represent you,

781
00:41:53,306 --> 00:41:56,301
you hurt my fucking feelings and that is the fucking matter's end

782
00:41:57,137 --> 00:41:58,340
Would you go against me?

783
00:41:58,645 --> 00:42:00,222
That is not what we're talking about

784
00:42:01,368 --> 00:42:02,953
You know I'd never break loyalty

785
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,542
That don't mean my feelings can't get hurt

786
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:11,113
Fucking point is you'd never go against me

787
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:12,120
Tolliver knows

788
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,683
I need someone he don't know that about

789
00:42:15,918 --> 00:42:17,452
I don't think Silas would go agin you neither

790
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,393
You and him haven't been through,

791
00:42:20,348 --> 00:42:22,453
me and him haven't been through what me and you've been through

792
00:42:22,857 --> 00:42:23,391
Hmm

793
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:25,230
Not by a long shot

794
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:29,181
So more than an opinion ain't possible

795
00:42:30,335 --> 00:42:33,073
Still, I'd be fucking surprised if either of us was mistaken

796
00:42:33,695 --> 00:42:34,253
Me too

797
00:42:39,538 --> 00:42:40,540
Fucking Doc

798
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:42,310
What's his problem?

799
00:42:42,736 --> 00:42:43,773
Thank he's a fucking lunger

800
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:44,950
Jesus Christ,

801
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:48,510
it is one fucking thing after another

802
00:42:55,877 --> 00:42:57,223
Observe a decent interval,

803
00:42:58,766 --> 00:43:00,933
and we'll give it another fucking whirl

804
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:15,870
Keep 'em separate, 

805
00:43:17,087 --> 00:43:19,653
agree on a time tomorrow when their dicks will be down,

806
00:43:20,546 --> 00:43:22,233
have 'em sign simultaneous

807
00:43:36,306 --> 00:43:38,282
Petite and quite beautiful your mother is,

808
00:43:39,335 --> 00:43:41,583
for being a financial powerhouse

809
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:45,882
Of service to the camp,

810
00:43:46,315 --> 00:43:49,033
turning her mine into houses and the like getting built,

811
00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:50,913
businesses begun

812
00:43:51,497 --> 00:43:54,140
Some for people that'll never know her name

813
00:44:00,876 --> 00:44:01,702
I'll take the air, 

814
00:44:02,786 --> 00:44:03,811
just briefly

815
00:44:05,305 --> 00:44:07,310
I'll continue to be beaten at checkers

816
00:44:28,805 --> 00:44:31,851
Any fucking domicile but the graveyarn suits me fine

817
00:44:32,426 --> 00:44:33,410
Don't you worry about me

818
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,870
I got things taken care of over here

819
00:44:38,047 --> 00:44:39,292
I don't know either

820
00:44:43,436 --> 00:44:44,113
But I do know 

821
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:46,991
that you're welcome wherever I go

822
00:45:02,026 --> 00:45:04,382
Is Mose invited to the new destination?

823
00:45:06,205 --> 00:45:09,862
Because I'd think you'd need to widen some doorways if he is

824
00:45:11,847 --> 00:45:13,193
Haven't talked to Mose about it

825
00:45:13,547 --> 00:45:14,571
Well, he can be the watchman then

826
00:45:14,938 --> 00:45:16,222
I have no issue with that

827
00:45:19,985 --> 00:45:21,233
We'll figure the rest out…

828
00:45:22,516 --> 00:45:23,531
when time comes

829
00:45:28,906 --> 00:45:30,353
Where would the stage be?

830
00:45:30,785 --> 00:45:31,460
I don't know

831
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,573
Yeah, I don't know either

832
00:45:35,517 --> 00:45:36,900
Ain't our line I guess

833
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:43,822
That they agreed tonight 

834
00:45:44,525 --> 00:45:47,490
is no guarantee what they'll do at 10:00 in the morning

835
00:45:55,015 --> 00:45:57,420
Please see that no harm comes to that horse

836
00:46:00,286 --> 00:46:00,913
I will

837
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:19,673
Then after the watches were synchronized,

838
00:46:20,065 --> 00:46:24,391
another hour studying them like idiots to see if one gained on the other

839
00:46:33,355 --> 00:46:34,403
Sol

840
00:46:45,615 --> 00:46:47,062
It's not the fucking hour

841
00:46:49,595 --> 00:46:51,540
It's not the fucking vantage of the chair

842
00:46:53,048 --> 00:46:53,763
It's you 

843
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,131
that's changed the level of your suction somehow

844
00:46:57,396 --> 00:46:58,893
That's the fucking sum and substance of it

845
00:46:59,588 --> 00:47:00,981
Maybe if I get up on my knees?

846
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:02,263
You're the cocksucker

847
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:03,292
Change the fucking angle

848
00:47:06,515 --> 00:47:07,770
Hey, Jesus Christ,

849
00:47:08,197 --> 00:47:09,342
you'll turn me inside out

850
00:47:12,445 --> 00:47:12,953
Come on

851
00:47:15,147 --> 00:47:17,321
Advice from third fucking parties…

852
00:47:18,858 --> 00:47:20,353
place a table on the boardwalk,

853
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:23,220
people can jot their suggestions,

854
00:47:24,048 --> 00:47:26,853
roll in the much of the thoroughfare in gales of fucking laughter

855
00:47:27,117 --> 00:47:28,372
I did not shame myself

856
00:47:29,938 --> 00:47:32,023
I keep an open mind in that area

857
00:47:32,435 --> 00:47:34,041
Kid yourself about your behavior,

858
00:47:34,298 --> 00:47:35,500
you'll never learn a fuckin' thing

859
00:47:40,226 --> 00:47:41,541
I knew what was coming too

860
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,191
Fucking Captain,

861
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:46,183
holding me down

862
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:49,841
I knew what the fuck was next

863
00:47:50,676 --> 00:47:51,970
When he chopped off your finger?

864
00:47:52,355 --> 00:47:54,040
He didn't chop off my finger

865
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,451
Hearst chopped my fucking finger off

866
00:47:56,736 --> 00:47:57,962
The other fuck held me down

867
00:47:59,408 --> 00:48:00,360
They hold you down, you

868
00:48:00,675 --> 00:48:02,373
you can't get at them to help yourself

869
00:48:04,908 --> 00:48:06,483
Fucking cold in here anyway

870
00:48:07,098 --> 00:48:08,103
You want a blanket?

871
00:48:08,477 --> 00:48:09,680
If I do I'll put it round me

872
00:48:10,026 --> 00:48:11,640
You ain't boss of the fucking bedclothes

873
00:48:15,575 --> 00:48:16,992
They hold you down from behind,

874
00:48:18,266 --> 00:48:20,521
then you wonder why you're helpless

875
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:22,802
How the fuck could you not be?!

876
00:48:23,975 --> 00:48:25,192
I don't like it either

877
00:48:25,816 --> 00:48:27,013
Another one that held me down,

878
00:48:27,257 --> 00:48:29,112
that fuckin' proctor when I tried to get to that ship

879
00:48:29,956 --> 00:48:31,143
He fuckin' held me,

880
00:48:31,665 --> 00:48:32,682
fuckin' wouldn't let me go

881
00:48:34,228 --> 00:48:35,232
Fucking my mind, you see?

882
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,903
She was being restrainded

883
00:48:38,196 --> 00:48:41,853
Couldn't get back off that had got on the boat to New Orleans to go suck prick in Georgia

884
00:48:42,338 --> 00:48:43,502
She changed her mind and

885
00:48:44,275 --> 00:48:48,651
and I was being restrained by that fat bastard orphanage proctor

886
00:48:50,648 --> 00:48:51,252
Anyway, that's it

887
00:48:51,586 --> 00:48:52,250
That's the end of it

888
00:48:52,505 --> 00:48:53,390
That's the fucking conclusion

889
00:48:55,547 --> 00:48:56,580
Christ, I'd have wished to

890
00:49:00,788 --> 00:49:02,991
though probably she'd have thrown me overboard anyway,

891
00:49:03,535 --> 00:49:04,971
but I'd have wished to get to that fucking ship

892
00:49:06,657 --> 00:49:08,060
But I was being restrained

893
00:49:09,755 --> 00:49:12,010
I couldn't get from where she'd left me

894
00:49:12,605 --> 00:49:14,123
He held me to that bed,

895
00:49:14,796 --> 00:49:17,113
her calling from the ship that had changed her mind

896
00:49:18,778 --> 00:49:19,971
I don't like it either

897
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:21,441
No, huh?

898
00:49:25,218 --> 00:49:26,030
What?

899
00:49:27,636 --> 00:49:28,943
When they hold you down

900
00:49:31,247 --> 00:49:33,323
I guess I do that, huh, with your fucking hair?

901
00:49:34,255 --> 00:49:34,783
No

902
00:49:35,677 --> 00:49:36,160
No?

903
00:49:42,597 --> 00:49:44,450
Well, bless you for a fucking fibber
