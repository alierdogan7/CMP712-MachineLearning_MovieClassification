1
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,623
Stopping?

2
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,480
Man, they look woebegone and faraway.

3
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,526
I'll only be here 24 hours.

4
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:00,357
In a place like this, it could be a lifetime.

5
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:06,332
- Good luck, Mr. Macreedy.
- Thank you. Thanks very much.

6
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:17,536
You for Black Rock?

7
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:20,614
- That's right.
- There must be some mistake.

8
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:24,881
I'm Hastings, the telegraph agent.
Nobody told me this train was stopping.

9
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:27,957
- They didn't?
- No, I just told you they didn't.

10
00:03:28,024 --> 00:03:31,482
And they ought to.
What I want to know is, why didn't they?

11
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:34,325
- Maybe they didn't think it was important.
- Important?

12
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:37,491
It's the first time the streamliner
stopped here in four years.

13
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:40,968
You being met?
You visiting folks or something?

14
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:42,971
I mean, what do you want?

15
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:47,805
I want to go to a place called Adobe Flat.
Are there any cabs available?

16
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,844
Adobe Flat? No cabs.

17
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,649
Hotel open?

18
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:58,019
Is the hotel open?

19
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:00,087
Thank you.

20
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:48,263
Pete, now listen.

21
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:52,802
A man just got off the train
and asked for Adobe Flat.

22
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,834
Afternoon.

23
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,614
Anything I can do for you?

24
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:01,340
- You run this hotel?
- No.

25
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,512
Then there's nothing you can do for me.

26
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:09,747
Find Smith.

27
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,635
Hello. Like a room.

28
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:26,571
- We're all filled up.
- Have you any idea where I could...

29
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:29,475
This is 1945, mister.
There's been a war on.

30
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:33,414
It ended a couple of months ago, didn't it?

31
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:36,179
Yeah, but the OPA lingers on.

32
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,648
- You don't know about the OPA?
- No, you tell me.

33
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:43,854
Well, for establishments
with less than 50 rooms...

34
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,793
the hotelkeeper's got to report regularly...

35
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:51,459
about tenants and registration.
There are penalties imposed.

36
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,334
- You seem to have lots of vacancies.
- Well, as I said...

37
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:04,942
They're every one of them locked up.

38
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,210
Some are showrooms...

39
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:11,580
for feed salesmen, cattle buyers.

40
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:13,615
The rest, they're spoken for.

41
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:16,749
Rented to cowboys, ranch hands
for when they come into town.

42
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:18,384
They pay by the month.

43
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,952
We provide for their every wish
and comfort.

44
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,760
- Do you understand?
- No, not exactly.

45
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:27,792
But while I'm pondering it,
why don't you get a room ready for me?

46
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,305
That will be a good one.

47
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,804
I'd like to have a bath. Where is it?

48
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,608
- At the head of the stairs.
- Thank you.

49
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:50,582
I don't know why you're so interested,
but the name is Macreedy.

50
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,487
- It's all in the ledger.
- You look like you need a hand.

51
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:14,308
John J. Macreedy, Los Angeles.

52
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:17,284
I want to know everything he does, Pete.
Phone calls, mail...

53
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,945
In the meantime?

54
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:23,622
In the meantime, I crowd him a little.
See if he's got any iron in his blood.

55
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,235
I guess maybe you're in the wrong room.

56
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,167
Do you think so?

57
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,974
What else you got on your mind?

58
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:20,338
Why, nothing else, I guess.

59
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:25,283
If you had half a mind, boy, you would
have paid attention to what Pete said.

60
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:27,914
He said these rooms here
is for us cowboys.

61
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,288
For our every wish and comfort.

62
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,290
- And this one is yours, I guess?
- When I'm in town.

63
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:36,695
And I'm in town, as any fool can see.

64
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,961
You can see that, can't you, boy?

65
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:40,627
Yes, I guess so.

66
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,134
Would you mind
if I sort of got my things together...

67
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:45,640
and found another room?

68
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,107
Not at all.

69
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:48,871
But if you really wanted this room...

70
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,005
we can maybe settle your claim
without all this talk.

71
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:56,948
I believe a man's nothing unless
he stands up for what's rightfully his.

72
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,486
What do you think?

73
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:02,517
- I guess so.
- You guess so.

74
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,484
But you still ain't claiming this room?

75
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:07,089
No, I guess not.

76
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:09,461
You're all the time guessing,
ain't you, boy?

77
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,557
Don't you know anything?

78
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:17,069
Well, I know that
ever since I got off the train...

79
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,539
everybody's been needling me. Why?

80
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:25,911
I guess I rightfully don't know.

81
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,684
He walks light for a big man, doesn't he?

82
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:37,157
- Who?
- You know who.

83
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:42,596
What do you think, Doc?

84
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:45,162
Why ask me?
He's no salesman, that's sure.

85
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,498
Unless he's peddling dynamite.

86
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:52,199
Maybe he's a cop or something.

87
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:55,506
- You ever see a cop with a stiff arm?
- Maybe his arm's all right.

88
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:58,376
Maybe he's hanging on to something tight
in his pocket.

89
00:09:58,447 --> 00:09:59,675
Like what? A pistol?

90
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:03,515
A stick of TNT, so he can blow up
the whole mangy, miserable town?

91
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,177
Why are you so interested, Sam?

92
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,850
If I was that interested...

93
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,261
I'd ask him.

94
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,128
Hey, wait a minute.

95
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,899
Got any cigarettes?

96
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,907
How long you staying?

97
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:33,138
Where? In my new room? I'm staying.

98
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:35,546
I mean, in the hotel.

99
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:39,186
Twenty-four hours, why?

100
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:41,388
Just asking.

101
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:44,551
Why? Are you gonna have a convention?

102
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:48,024
I was just asking.

103
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:51,892
- Where can I get a car?
- I don't know.

104
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:54,568
Let's put it this way.

105
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:56,832
Supposing I had a car
and I wanted some gas.

106
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,000
- Where would I go?
- But you don't have a car.

107
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:03,270
You might try that garage
down at the end of the street.

108
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:04,608
Thank you.

109
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:29,866
Here we go again.

110
00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:57,894
This is all I know about him, Mr. Smith.

111
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,106
Sit down, Coley.

112
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:08,075
- I was only...
- Sit down.

113
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,841
Real cool guy.

114
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:13,909
Doesn't push easy, huh?

115
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,544
Well, that's it. That's just it.
He pushes too easy.

116
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:20,117
- Maybe we ought...
- What do you want, Doc?

117
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:23,750
Nothing. I was just wondering
what all you people are worrying about.

118
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,885
Not that I have the slightest idea.

119
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,929
You wonder too much
and you talk too much.

120
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,464
It's a bad parlay, Doc.

121
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:32,467
I hold no truck with silence.
I've got nothing to hide.

122
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:34,765
- What are you trying to say?
- Nothing, man.

123
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,637
You worry about the stranger only
if you look at him from a certain aspect.

124
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:40,834
How do you look at him, Doc?

125
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,838
With the innocence of a fresh-laid egg.

126
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:46,609
Keep it up, Doc. Make bad jokes. Be funny.

127
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:50,174
Someday I'll have Coley
wash your mouth out with lye.

128
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,374
I called the Circle T.

129
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:53,438
He ain't got business there
if they don't know him. Right, Mr. Smith?

130
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,483
Send a wire to Nick Gandi in Los Angeles.

131
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:59,487
Tell him to find out everything he can
about John J. Macreedy.

132
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:02,718
- What was that?
- Nick Gandi, Los Angeles.

133
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:05,017
Tell him I wanna know fast.

134
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,619
- Sign my name.
- Who was that?

135
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,027
Nick Gandi.

136
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,932
G-A-N-D-I. Blake Hotel.
You get the rest of it?

137
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:15,469
- Yes, sir.
- All right. Sign my name.

138
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:18,071
Who's Gandi?

139
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:22,141
Private detective.
I drive to LA now and then.

140
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,539
This guy Gandi can get us the dope?

141
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:30,312
He can get us anything we want
for $20 a day and expenses.

142
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:32,952
Don't get too nervous too fast, Hector.

143
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:36,048
- It's just I don't like it.
- Maybe he's just passing through.

144
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,787
Don't bet on it. He can mean only trouble.

145
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:41,421
Hector, you're jumpy as a stall horse.

146
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:44,029
We ought to see him. Talk to him.

147
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,461
About what?
What will I talk to him about?

148
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:50,630
The birds, the bees,
the crops, the weather?

149
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:52,139
You tried it. What'd it get you?

150
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:55,199
- It's just I thought that...
- You just thought.

151
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:57,040
Well, what'll we do?

152
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,610
What'll you do?
You'll wait, just like Pete here.

153
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:03,379
That right, Pete? And that's all you'll do.

154
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:07,618
- And while you wait, I'll talk to him.
- Hey, what do you know?

155
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,682
Mr. Macreedy seems to be heading
for the jail.

156
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:24,370
Now, what do you suppose
he'd wanna talk to the sheriff about?

157
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:55,099
Hold it, friend.

158
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:02,004
I ain't hankering to get locked
in my own jail.

159
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,076
I'm sorry, I thought you were a guest.

160
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:07,980
As it happens, I'm the host.

161
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:20,853
- Snort?
- No, thank you.

162
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,897
I don't blame you. It's awful.

163
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:31,870
What are you looking at?

164
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,034
- You tell me.
- I ain't always this bad.

165
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:39,274
It's just that last night me and my pal,
Doc Velie, did a little celebrating.

166
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:41,009
What were you celebrating?

167
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,744
Well, you name it.

168
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:44,912
What do you want?

169
00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:49,085
My name is Macreedy.
I came in on the streamliner.

170
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:50,555
You what?

171
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:53,356
- I say, I came in on the...
- You ain't from around here.

172
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,727
Are you up Phoenix way?

173
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,699
Tucson? Mesa?

174
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:02,561
You ain't selling cattle nor seed corn,
nothing like that?

175
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:04,868
No, all I want from you
is a little information.

176
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,773
I have to go to a place called Adobe Flat.

177
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:11,738
This ain't no information bureau.

178
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:17,512
That's one thing about Black Rock:
Everybody is polite.

179
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:19,554
That makes for very gracious living.

180
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,351
- Nobody asked you here.
- How do you know?

181
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:28,128
- What about Adobe Flat?
- I'm looking for a man named Komako.

182
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:36,234
- Almost a disaster.
- Yeah, a fate worse than death.

183
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:38,472
You move fast for a crip...

184
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,899
For a big man.

185
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:45,011
How about Komako?

186
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,917
If there are no further questions...

187
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:25,917
Greetings.

188
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:29,418
That's the first pleasant word I've heard
since I got here.

189
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,585
My name is Smith.
I own the Three-Bar Ranch.

190
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,627
I want to apologize
for some of the people in town.

191
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:38,995
They act like they are sitting on a keg.

192
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,625
A keg? Of what?

193
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:42,694
I don't know:

194
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:45,129
Diamonds, gunpowder.

195
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:47,541
It's nothing like that.

196
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,735
We're suspicious of strangers is all.

197
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:53,008
Hangover from the old days. The Old West.

198
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:56,608
I thought the tradition of the Old West
was hospitality.

199
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,551
I'm trying to be hospitable, Mr. Macreedy.

200
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:02,585
- You going to be around long?
- Could be.

201
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,725
How'd you like to go hunting tomorrow?
I'd be proud to have you as my guest.

202
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,888
Thanks. I'm afraid I can't.

203
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:11,595
Because of your arm, I suppose.

204
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:14,431
I knew a man who lost his arm once
in a threshing accident.

205
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:17,734
He used to hunt all the time.
He was quite a man. He...

206
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:21,267
Sorry. If there's anything I can do
while you're around...

207
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:25,177
No, I was just looking for...
No, it doesn't matter.

208
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,448
You were looking for what, Mr. Macreedy?

209
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:32,112
I was looking for a man named Komako.

210
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,454
Komako. Sure, I remember him.

211
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:38,084
Japanese farmer. Never had a chance.

212
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,462
Got here in '41, just before Pearl Harbor.

213
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:46,725
Three months later, they shipped him off
to a relocation center.

214
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:48,030
Tough.

215
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,966
You don't happen to remember
which one they sent him to, do you?

216
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:57,176
Who knows?

217
00:19:57,846 --> 00:19:59,643
Why don't you try writing him?

218
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,444
Glad to help you out.

219
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:05,278
I'm afraid you'd be wasting your time.
I've already written...

220
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:09,415
but they don't forward my letters.
They keep sending them back.

221
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,990
They do?

222
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:28,966
- Need any help?
- I can manage.

223
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,770
Well, I need a little help.
I'd like to rent your jeep.

224
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:36,044
That'll be $2 an hour. Gas extra.

225
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:39,645
- $10 for my time.
- Why not ask him where he wants to go?

226
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,218
He wants to go to Adobe Flat.

227
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:44,548
Is the road marked well?

228
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:46,924
Yeah, it's about six or seven miles down.

229
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,088
Fine, then I won't need your time.

230
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,928
- I thought you might need a little help.
- Oh, no.

231
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,763
I'll get along fine, thank you.

232
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,669
Liz, do you have a license to hire cars?
You might get into trouble.

233
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:00,037
I won't say a word to the sheriff.

234
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,283
You shouldn't have done that.

235
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,686
Thought it would be better if he went and
got done with it. What can he find out?

236
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,952
I wouldn't do anything to hurt you, Reno.
You know that.

237
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,627
This is liable to be the hardest $10
you ever earned in your life.

238
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:00,768
- What do you want?
- He asked about Komako.

239
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:04,437
- Do you think he'll kick up a storm?
- A storm?

240
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:06,832
- What about?
- I don't know.

241
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,408
All I know is that
I don't want no more trouble around here.

242
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,413
Never again, trouble.

243
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:15,748
You don't know anything about Komako,
do you?

244
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:17,751
I do not. That's the point.

245
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:21,152
The point is, what you don't know
won't hurt you.

246
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,490
Maybe there's something I ought to know.

247
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:25,651
Maybe there's something
I ought to ask you...

248
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:29,185
before the stranger returns
and starts breathing down my neck.

249
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:33,132
Tim, you're just a lost ball
in the high weeds.

250
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:36,466
I told you a long time ago,
nothing happened for you to worry about.

251
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:37,766
The thing is, I do worry.

252
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,933
Maybe I ain't much else,
but I'm sure a worrier.

253
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:43,000
And I'm still the law.

254
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,615
Then do your job, Tim.

255
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:51,413
What is my job, Mr. Smith?

256
00:22:51,486 --> 00:22:53,818
I'd better find out
before Macreedy does it for me.

257
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:55,914
Macreedy will do nothing.

258
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:58,283
And neither will you, Tim.

259
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,196
- Suppose I decide to try.
- That might be dangerous.

260
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:07,196
You got the body of a hippo
but the brain of a rabbit. Don't overtax it.

261
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:14,299
Yes, Mr. Smith.

262
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:19,878
Tim, buy you a cup of coffee?

263
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,146
- From LA?
- Yeah, from that private detective.

264
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:58,482
What does he say?
Who is this guy, anyway?

265
00:23:58,553 --> 00:24:00,748
Never heard of him, that's what he says.

266
00:24:00,822 --> 00:24:02,847
He checked. There's no John J. Macreedy.

267
00:24:02,924 --> 00:24:05,654
No listing, no record,
no information, nothing.

268
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:07,422
Where does that leave us?

269
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:10,693
I'll tell you where it leaves us.
I'm sick and...

270
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:42,858
Now, Coley.

271
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:46,798
- I think Macreedy's a nothing. A nobody.
- Is he?

272
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:50,031
- So there's nothing to worry about.
- Isn't there?

273
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:52,363
You got brains, you have.

274
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:55,602
What can he find out? That Komako...

275
00:24:58,313 --> 00:25:00,110
Suppose he finds out.

276
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,149
A nobody like Macreedy
can raise a pretty big stink.

277
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:08,523
The point is,
who'd miss a nobody like Macreedy...

278
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,151
if he just, say, disappeared?

279
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:14,659
Who, Coley?

280
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:19,666
- Why don't we wait?
- Wait for what?

281
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:22,828
I mean, maybe he won't find anything.
Maybe he'll just go away.

282
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:26,271
Not Macreedy. I know those maimed guys.

283
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:28,866
Their minds get twisted.

284
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,879
They put on hair shirts
and act like martyrs.

285
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:36,547
All of them are do-gooders,
freaks, troublemakers.

286
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,451
Let's wait and see. There's no danger yet.

287
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:41,318
"No danger," he says.

288
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,653
This guy is like a carrier of smallpox.

289
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:49,624
Since he's arrived, this town has a fever.
An infection.

290
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:51,961
And it's spreading.

291
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:56,335
Hastings in a sick sweat,
running around, shooting off his face.

292
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:59,896
Doc getting snotty with me
for the first time in four years.

293
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,433
- And Liz, your sister, acts like a fool.
- She's only a kid.

294
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:06,241
Kid? She must have strained
every muscle in her head...

295
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,908
to get so stupid, renting him a jeep.

296
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:12,747
Tim the rumdum...

297
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,313
suddenly decides
he's got to act like a sheriff.

298
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:18,621
And he says there's no danger.

299
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:24,498
Of course,
if you want to take the chance...

300
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,137
- Not me.
- All right, then.

301
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:34,368
You're mighty quick to kill.
He's not an animal.

302
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:37,002
Well, listen to the little spitfire.

303
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,807
You miserable little toad.
I'm saving your neck.

304
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:44,446
- Lf I don't, who will? Tim? Doc?
- All l...

305
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,384
Your sister with the rocks in her head?

306
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:49,719
There's one thing about her.
She's got twice the guts you have.

307
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:53,158
- You're only fit for running away.
- And it's too late for that.

308
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:56,061
He's in this, and he ain't running no place.

309
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,492
All right, then.

310
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:34,161
Let Smith find himself a new boy.
I can't take it another day.

311
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,567
If you're a sheriff, they gotta respect you.

312
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:39,471
Otherwise you can't do your job.
They just laugh.

313
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:41,636
I don't laugh, Tim.

314
00:27:41,943 --> 00:27:44,241
- Why don't you?
- Cut it out, Tim.

315
00:27:44,312 --> 00:27:45,404
You should.

316
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,415
In the name of well-adjusted manhood,
get a hold of yourself.

317
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:51,213
Snap out of it. You're gonna have
a complex or something.

318
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:53,254
Four years ago, if I'd have done my job...

319
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:55,721
if I'd checked up
and found out what happened...

320
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,418
But I didn't. It was just like Smith figured.

321
00:27:58,493 --> 00:28:02,589
What did you find out? They told you
a story, you had to believe it.

322
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:04,495
Would you believe it?

323
00:28:07,302 --> 00:28:10,635
I don't know.
I live a quiet, contemplative life.

324
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:13,974
Me, I didn't even try to find out.

325
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:15,741
Don't you understand?

326
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,040
When you wear this badge, you're the law.

327
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,206
When someone does something
against the law...

328
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,011
then you're supposed to
do something about it.

329
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:24,745
Me, I did nothing.

330
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:28,017
That's what's eating me.

331
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:30,990
What kind of prescription you got for that?

332
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,949
I don't know.

333
00:28:33,695 --> 00:28:35,925
Haven't found one for myself.

334
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:39,027
But there's one thing, Tim: Don't quit!

335
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,397
Why not?

336
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:45,232
Because maybe this fellow Macreedy's
got the prescription.

337
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:14,031
Well, if it's not Macreedy...

338
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:16,366
the world's champion road hog.

339
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:20,095
- Yeah, it's a small world.
- But such an unfriendly one.

340
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:23,070
Why'd you wanna crowd me off the road?

341
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:26,278
I'm sorry if I incurred your displeasure.

342
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:28,675
Look what you did to my car.

343
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:32,913
Anything I can do to make it up?

344
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:37,048
You ought to be more careful, man.
All that one-arm driving.

345
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,157
I'll be glad to pay for the damages.

346
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:42,560
It's a threat to life and limb.

347
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:45,292
Fortunately, no one was hurt.

348
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:50,195
You could get yourself killed that way,
nosing all over the countryside.

349
00:34:52,473 --> 00:34:54,998
I guess that's a danger, all right.

350
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:59,669
That's pretty smart of you.
How long do you intend to keep it up?

351
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:01,806
I'm pulling out right now.

352
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:13,154
- Still expecting that convention?
- What?

353
00:35:13,227 --> 00:35:16,685
If you're expecting any extra cowboys,
my room is available.

354
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:18,527
Are you checking out?

355
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,193
Any trains leaving tonight?

356
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,994
- Tomorrow morning. The streamliner.
- I know about that.

357
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:29,034
Milk train or freights?

358
00:35:29,577 --> 00:35:32,705
- Tomorrow, after the streamliner.
- Buses?

359
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:36,749
Closest stop is Sand City, 32 miles away.

360
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:39,979
You're in such a hurry,
you should have never got off here.

361
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,386
I'm inclined to agree with you.

362
00:36:16,657 --> 00:36:20,525
If you're looking for the keys to the jeep,
they're not there.

363
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:24,162
- Where would you suggest I look?
- The jeep's not for rent.

364
00:36:24,232 --> 00:36:27,827
- Why, it was just a few hours ago.
- Things change.

365
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:31,835
Sure do.

366
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:36,268
And Smith is the kid
who changes them, isn't he?

367
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,303
You mind if I use this?

368
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:41,439
Yeah, go ahead.

369
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,130
What's wrong with this town of yours,
Miss Wirth?

370
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:02,965
Nothing's wrong with this town,
Mr. Macreedy.

371
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:04,629
It's none of your concern.

372
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:07,367
Why is everybody so concerned
about me then?

373
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:09,375
- Am I concerned?
- No, you're not, but...

374
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:10,535
But what?

375
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:13,079
I have a feeling
you're a little bit too unconcerned.

376
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,615
You're so unconcerned,
you won't even rent me a jeep.

377
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:18,083
I don't own a taxi service.
I don't have a license.

378
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,619
Too bad everybody in this town...

379
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:23,316
isn't as scrupulously devoted
to law and order as you are.

380
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:26,822
I don't want to get involved.

381
00:37:26,894 --> 00:37:29,590
- Involved in what?
- Whatever you're up to!

382
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,292
Whatever happens,
I've got to go on living in this town.

383
00:37:32,366 --> 00:37:34,732
These people are my neighbors,
my friends.

384
00:37:34,802 --> 00:37:36,201
All of them?

385
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:39,771
This is my town, Mr. Macreedy.
Like it or not.

386
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:43,304
Well, if you don't like it,
why do you stick around?

387
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:46,471
My brother, Pete, he'd never leave.

388
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:49,578
Did it ever occur to you
that you might leave without him?

389
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,585
You look like an independent young lady.
Your brother seems...

390
00:37:52,653 --> 00:37:55,486
Weak? I know.
That's why I couldn't leave him.

391
00:37:55,556 --> 00:37:57,547
What did your brother do?

392
00:37:57,725 --> 00:38:00,421
What do you care?
What do you care about Black Rock?

393
00:38:00,494 --> 00:38:02,655
I don't care anything about Black Rock.

394
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,257
Only it seems to me that there aren't
many towns like this in America.

395
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:08,700
But one town like it is enough.

396
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:13,564
And because I think something kind of bad
happened here, Miss Wirth.

397
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:16,974
Something they can't quite seem
to find a handle to.

398
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:20,673
- You don't know what you're saying.
- Well, I know this much.

399
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:24,343
The rule of law has left here
and the gorillas have taken over.

400
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:27,819
Yeah, and you just tried to steal
the key to my jeep.

401
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,187
I figured that
that was the only way I could get it.

402
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:33,583
Was I wrong, Miss Wirth?

403
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:37,749
I'd like to ask you a few questions
while you're around.

404
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:40,159
I'm around, all right.

405
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:43,087
I guess probably you've heard...

406
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:46,622
that Miss Wirth is no longer
in the car rental business.

407
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,295
Good. I wouldn't want to see that girl
get into trouble.

408
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:53,601
- Wouldn't you?
- What with rental permits...

409
00:39:53,674 --> 00:39:56,199
gas rationing, you know what I mean.

410
00:39:56,911 --> 00:40:00,677
Yeah, I certainly admire
your sturdy sense of responsibility.

411
00:40:00,748 --> 00:40:04,149
It's just that, that girl has a future.

412
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,113
Let's talk about my future.

413
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:13,888
- Do you think you have the time?
- I don't seem to be going anywhere.

414
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:20,924
I hear you handle a jeep real well.

415
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:24,493
Yes, I do have a way with jeeps.
A certain familiarity.

416
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:27,772
I think I understand. You're an army man.

417
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,135
- Where'd you get it?
- Italy.

418
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:34,437
That's tough.

419
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:39,213
I tried to enlist myself the day after
those rats bombed Pearl Harbor.

420
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:40,548
What stopped you?

421
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:42,418
Physical. They wouldn't take me.

422
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:46,153
Morning after Pearl, I was the first man
at Marine Recruiting in Sand City.

423
00:40:46,227 --> 00:40:48,092
They wouldn't take me.

424
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,522
Tough.

425
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,324
What do you do in Los Angeles,
Mr. Macreedy?

426
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,889
I'm retired.

427
00:40:55,402 --> 00:40:58,235
You might say
I was forced into retirement.

428
00:41:03,244 --> 00:41:06,008
What were you looking for in Adobe Flat?

429
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:10,075
Like I told you, I was looking
for a fellow named Komako.

430
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:12,779
And like you told me, he wasn't there.

431
00:41:14,755 --> 00:41:17,155
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

432
00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:20,183
Just I don't believe you.

433
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:23,125
I believe a man is as big
as what he is seeking.

434
00:41:23,197 --> 00:41:25,893
I believe you are a big man, Mr. Macreedy.

435
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:27,831
Flattery will get you nowhere.

436
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,633
Why would a man like you
be looking for a lousy Jap farmer?

437
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:35,141
- You can't tell. Maybe I'm not so big.
- Yes, you are.

438
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:39,442
I believe a man is as big
as what will make him mad.

439
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:42,004
Nobody around here seems big enough
to get you mad.

440
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,573
- What makes you mad, Mr. Smith?
- Me?

441
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:48,681
- Nothing.
- You're a pretty big man yourself.

442
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:54,049
- The Japanese make you mad, don't they?
- Well, that's different.

443
00:41:54,562 --> 00:41:58,498
After that sneak attack
on Pearl Harbor. Bataan.

444
00:41:58,732 --> 00:42:01,599
- Komako made you mad?
- It's the same thing.

445
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:04,467
Loyal Japanese-Americans. That's a laugh.

446
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:08,672
They're all mad dogs.
What about Corregidor, the Death March?

447
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,874
What did Komako
have to do with Corregidor?

448
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,914
He was a Jap, wasn't he?

449
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,511
Look, Mr. Macreedy.

450
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:19,212
There's a law in this county
against shooting dogs.

451
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:22,915
But when I see a mad dog,
I don't wait for him to bite me.

452
00:42:24,091 --> 00:42:25,956
I swear,
you're beginning to make me mad.

453
00:42:26,026 --> 00:42:27,687
All strangers do.

454
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,328
No, they don't. Not all of them.

455
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,195
Some do
when they come around snooping.

456
00:42:33,267 --> 00:42:34,791
- Snooping for what?
- I don't know.

457
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:36,733
Outsiders coming in
looking for something.

458
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,136
- Looking for what?
- I don't know!

459
00:42:39,206 --> 00:42:43,040
Somebody's always looking for something
in this part of the West.

460
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,910
To the historian, it's the Old West.
To the book writer, it's the Wild West.

461
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,745
To the businessman,
it's the Undeveloped West.

462
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,377
They say we're all poor and backward,
and I guess we are.

463
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:54,546
We don't even have enough water.

464
00:42:54,622 --> 00:42:58,581
But to us, this place is our West.
And I wish they'd leave us alone.

465
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,957
Leave you alone to do what?

466
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,289
I don't know what you mean.

467
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,561
What happened to Komako?

468
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:15,402
He went away. I told you.

469
00:43:15,476 --> 00:43:19,105
Shortly after he left, some kids
went out there. They got fooling around.

470
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:23,411
They burned his place down. That's how
it was. You know how kids are.

471
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:28,353
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

472
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:30,583
It's just that I don't believe you...

473
00:43:30,658 --> 00:43:33,718
any more than I believed you
about the letters.

474
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:36,959
You don't seem to believe anything I say.

475
00:43:37,164 --> 00:43:41,260
Yes, I believe you about
what you say about the businessmen...

476
00:43:41,335 --> 00:43:43,929
being interested in Adobe Flat.

477
00:43:44,605 --> 00:43:45,663
Why?

478
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:49,831
Well, I would think
they would be interested...

479
00:43:49,943 --> 00:43:53,140
maybe some historian,
in all that land lying fallow.

480
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:57,172
You know, it could be used
for some purpose, maybe a graveyard.

481
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,814
There's something buried up there.

482
00:44:03,457 --> 00:44:05,254
You have wildflowers.

483
00:44:05,826 --> 00:44:08,727
That means a grave.
I suppose you knew that.

484
00:44:10,197 --> 00:44:12,461
I saw a lot of it overseas.

485
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:17,095
Figured it wasn't a human grave
because it wasn't marked.

486
00:44:17,171 --> 00:44:19,469
Kind of a mystery, isn't it?

487
00:44:19,673 --> 00:44:20,970
Kind of.

488
00:44:22,142 --> 00:44:24,269
Maybe you can figure it out.

489
00:44:24,678 --> 00:44:27,340
- Maybe.
- Why don't you give it a whirl?

490
00:44:27,715 --> 00:44:30,741
It might help you pass the time
for a while.

491
00:44:32,186 --> 00:44:35,849
Well, I've got other things to do.
I'm not interested.

492
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:12,718
- Hi.
- Hello.

493
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,159
- Pull up a chair.
- Can I use your phone?

494
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:17,094
Yeah, help yourself.

495
00:45:17,364 --> 00:45:21,562
You're one of the few people
who's been back here I can say that to.

496
00:45:25,406 --> 00:45:27,067
It's 424.

497
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,737
What's 424?

498
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,507
If I've got you pegged, and I think I have,
you're calling the State Police.

499
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,708
But if I was you,
and I'm surely glad I'm not...

500
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:40,385
I'd look it up myself.
I wouldn't trust anybody around here.

501
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:41,921
Including me.

502
00:45:45,225 --> 00:45:46,817
424, please.

503
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:51,858
424? The lines are all busy.

504
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:06,439
Don't tell me, I know.
The lines are all busy. Be busy all day.

505
00:46:17,124 --> 00:46:20,116
- You mind not looking at me like that?
- Like what?

506
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,185
Like a potential customer.

507
00:46:22,262 --> 00:46:25,663
Everybody is.
And I get them coming and going.

508
00:46:27,768 --> 00:46:30,202
First, I sell them a piece of land.

509
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:32,295
Do you think they farm it?

510
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,966
They do not. They dig for gold.

511
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,436
They rip off the topsoil
of 10 winding hills...

512
00:46:38,512 --> 00:46:42,414
then sprint in here all fog-heaved
with excitement, lugging nuggets...

513
00:46:42,483 --> 00:46:44,383
big, bright, and shiny.

514
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:48,317
Is it gold? It is not.

515
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,187
Do they quit? They do not.

516
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,793
Then they decide to farm.

517
00:46:55,863 --> 00:47:00,300
Farm in a country so dry that you
have to prime a man before he can spit.

518
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:04,164
Before you can say "Fat Sam,"
they're stalled, stranded, and starving.

519
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,139
They become weevil-brained
and butt-sprung.

520
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:11,234
So I bury them.

521
00:47:12,713 --> 00:47:15,147
But why bore you with my triumphs?

522
00:47:15,215 --> 00:47:18,582
- I got a problem of my own.
- You sure have.

523
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:22,321
They're gonna kill you
with no hard feelings.

524
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:24,857
And you're gonna sit there
and let them do it.

525
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:28,088
- Don't get waspish with me, mister.
- I'm sorry.

526
00:47:28,996 --> 00:47:32,898
I feel for you.
But I'm consumed with apathy.

527
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:37,292
- Why should I mix in?
- I don't know. Maybe to save a life.

528
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:40,397
I've got enough trouble
saving my own. Look.

529
00:47:41,575 --> 00:47:44,976
I try to live right.
I drink my milk every day.

530
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:47,912
But mostly I try to mind
my own business...

531
00:47:48,248 --> 00:47:50,216
which is something I advise you to do.

532
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,047
It's a little late for that.

533
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:56,681
No, you can still get out of town.
But you'd better get out like a whisper.

534
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,951
How?

535
00:48:00,594 --> 00:48:04,121
I've got sort of a limousine
at your disposal.

536
00:48:05,265 --> 00:48:06,857
Where is it?

537
00:48:50,711 --> 00:48:52,702
Must be something wrong.

538
00:48:59,753 --> 00:49:01,550
Could be the wiring.

539
00:49:10,764 --> 00:49:14,825
Yeah, it's the wiring.
Now, wasn't that a good guess?

540
00:49:15,602 --> 00:49:17,570
Maybe it can be fixed.

541
00:49:17,771 --> 00:49:21,867
Easy. Except maybe if this wire
was busted or something.

542
00:49:24,478 --> 00:49:29,040
Do the nice little things, like keep
your big, fat nose out of my business.

543
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,458
Yeah, it was the wiring.

544
00:49:49,169 --> 00:49:50,568
I'm sorry.

545
00:49:51,204 --> 00:49:54,867
- But you gotta admit, I tried.
- And for that, I thank you.

546
00:49:56,043 --> 00:49:58,944
How much time do you think I've got
before they...

547
00:49:59,012 --> 00:50:01,344
You've got at least till dark.

548
00:50:02,049 --> 00:50:04,984
They'd be afraid to see each other's faces.

549
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,119
Well, thanks, Doc.

550
00:50:08,188 --> 00:50:11,487
- I can't say that it's been charming...
- Where are you going?

551
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:13,492
I don't know, but I'm going on foot.

552
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,620
That's no good.
You stray 10 yards off the main street...

553
00:50:16,697 --> 00:50:18,858
and you'll be stone-cold dead.

554
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,162
That's the situation in a nut.

555
00:50:23,637 --> 00:50:25,229
Maybe...

556
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:27,939
Maybe what?

557
00:50:31,912 --> 00:50:33,903
I'll see you later, Doc.

558
00:50:58,071 --> 00:50:59,436
Lemonade?

559
00:51:01,608 --> 00:51:04,839
- No, thank you.
- It's hot as Billy-be-durned.

560
00:51:13,587 --> 00:51:17,079
- Don't you like lemonade?
- Never thought much about it.

561
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,292
You notifying the State Police?

562
00:51:22,929 --> 00:51:24,726
That's what it says.

563
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:27,256
You sure you don't want some lemonade?

564
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,167
It don't have the muzzle velocity
of other drinks here...

565
00:51:30,237 --> 00:51:32,000
but it's good for what ails you.

566
00:51:32,072 --> 00:51:34,836
- What ails you, Mr. Hastings?
- Me?

567
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:39,838
Why are you so upset about this wire?

568
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,578
- Me?
- Are you afraid, Mr. Hastings?

569
00:51:44,584 --> 00:51:47,451
Mr. Macreedy, I'm just a good neighbor.

570
00:51:48,121 --> 00:51:51,386
To Smith, you are.
What about to Komako?

571
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:54,792
I've never seen Komako in my life. Honest.

572
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,693
All right.

573
00:51:56,963 --> 00:52:00,421
Then you'll send that message
and give me the answer, won't you?

574
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,831
Yes, sir.

575
00:52:23,123 --> 00:52:24,954
- What'll you have?
- What've you got?

576
00:52:25,025 --> 00:52:26,652
Chili and beans.

577
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,286
- Anything else?
- Chili without beans.

578
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:32,623
If you don't like the flavor, there's ketchup.

579
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:35,497
All right, I'll have it. A cup of coffee.

580
00:52:43,977 --> 00:52:48,846
Well, you still around?
I thought you didn't like this place.

581
00:52:51,184 --> 00:52:54,950
- You mean going to or coming from?
- Staying put.

582
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:00,255
- No comment.
- "No comment," he says.

583
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:04,424
No comment,
and all the time he's got my stool.

584
00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:34,854
This stool ain't comfortable.

585
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,160
I was afraid of that.

586
00:53:37,864 --> 00:53:40,389
I think I'd like the one you're on.

587
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:43,863
He's as changeable as a prairie fire.

588
00:53:47,173 --> 00:53:49,607
Suppose you tell me where to sit.

589
00:54:06,026 --> 00:54:08,153
I hope that ain't too much.

590
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,434
Your friend's a very argumentative fellow.

591
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:19,732
Sort of unpredictable, too.
Got a temper like a rattlesnake.

592
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,567
That's me all over.
I'm half-horse, half-alligator.

593
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,376
You mess with me
and I'll kick a lung out of you.

594
00:54:26,446 --> 00:54:28,505
What do you think of that?

595
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:30,548
No comment.

596
00:54:30,951 --> 00:54:34,443
Talking to you is like pulling teeth.
You wear me out.

597
00:54:35,322 --> 00:54:38,553
You're a yellow-bellied Jap lover!
Am I right or wrong?

598
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:42,459
You're not only wrong,
you're wrong at the top of your voice.

599
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,921
You don't like my voice?

600
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,765
I think your friend
is trying to start trouble.

601
00:54:51,171 --> 00:54:53,662
Why ever would he want to do that?

602
00:54:54,307 --> 00:54:56,571
I don't know. Maybe he thinks...

603
00:54:56,643 --> 00:55:00,909
that if he needles me enough,
I might crack. I might even fight back.

604
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:06,349
Then either he or your other ape
sitting over there could beat me to death...

605
00:55:06,419 --> 00:55:08,649
and cop a plea of self-defense.

606
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,883
I don't think that'll be necessary.

607
00:55:10,991 --> 00:55:14,085
You're so scared now,
you'll probably drown in your own sweat.

608
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,151
Before that happens...

609
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,564
couldn't I pick a fight with you
if I tied one hand behind me?

610
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,976
If I tied both hands?

611
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,367
Wouldn't it have been easier to wait
until I turned my back...

612
00:57:03,436 --> 00:57:05,927
or are there too many witnesses present?

613
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,302
You're still in trouble.

614
00:57:07,373 --> 00:57:10,501
You're in trouble.
Whatever happens, you're sunk.

615
00:57:10,577 --> 00:57:12,545
You got things a bit twisted.

616
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:16,139
You killed Komako, Smith.
Sooner or later, you're gonna go up for it.

617
00:57:16,216 --> 00:57:17,581
Not because you killed him...

618
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:20,380
because in a town like this
you can get away with it.

619
00:57:20,453 --> 00:57:23,013
But because you didn't have the guts
to do it alone...

620
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:26,286
you put your trust in guys like this
and Hector here.

621
00:57:26,392 --> 00:57:28,656
Not the most dependable
of God's creatures.

622
00:57:28,728 --> 00:57:32,892
One of these days, they're gonna catch on
you're playing them for a sap. Then what?

623
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:35,196
Peel them off one by one?

624
00:57:35,268 --> 00:57:37,133
Meantime, one of them is gonna crack...

625
00:57:37,237 --> 00:57:40,468
and when they do, you're gonna go down.
But hard.

626
00:57:41,274 --> 00:57:43,640
Because they got something
on you, Smith.

627
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,645
Something to use
when the going gets tough.

628
00:57:48,481 --> 00:57:51,211
And it's getting tougher every minute.

629
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:00,653
Man, oh, man.

630
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,508
- Anything come for me?
- Nothing.

631
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:56,845
- Telegram or nothing?
- Nothing.

632
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:04,857
In case you're interested, Coley will live,
I'm truly sorry to say.

633
00:59:05,658 --> 00:59:07,785
Your friend's pretty tough.

634
00:59:08,161 --> 00:59:11,722
Yeah, he's wicked.
He defends himself when he's attacked.

635
00:59:15,702 --> 00:59:18,227
You gonna sit there and let time run out?

636
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,932
Waiting for an answer from the state cops.

637
00:59:21,007 --> 00:59:23,237
You send it through Hastings?

638
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:27,340
Just don't expect an answer,
if that's the way you sent it.

639
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:33,148
I guess that's probably for me.

640
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,025
Where's my answer?

641
00:59:46,099 --> 00:59:49,626
Do you expect an answer
from a wire that was never sent?

642
00:59:49,902 --> 00:59:51,233
What's so funny?

643
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:55,741
I just had a thought.
A thought that is dazzling in its purity.

644
00:59:57,243 --> 00:59:59,404
You're in a lot of trouble.

645
00:59:59,879 --> 01:00:02,370
You gave my message to Smith,
didn't you?

646
01:00:02,448 --> 01:00:05,110
Why, you little wart!
That's a federal offense.

647
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,242
You're in this deep, too.

648
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:09,345
Like I say,
it's getting tougher and tougher.

649
01:00:09,656 --> 01:00:13,023
Maybe you'd better do something
about this, Sheriff.

650
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,995
I reckon that's right, Mr. Smith.
You're not supposed to...

651
01:00:21,067 --> 01:00:22,864
Don't be a jerk, Tim.

652
01:00:23,836 --> 01:00:27,033
Divulging information?
There's a law that says you...

653
01:00:29,142 --> 01:00:30,939
Tim, you're pathetic.

654
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:35,412
Maybe so, but I'm still sheriff.

655
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:39,442
That's the point.
You're not sheriff anymore.

656
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,883
You're so pathetic, you just lost a job.

657
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:47,218
Okay, Sheriff...

658
01:00:48,928 --> 01:00:50,020
take over.

659
01:00:50,096 --> 01:00:51,927
- You can't do that!
- I can't?

660
01:00:51,998 --> 01:00:55,161
I put him in the job,
and now I'm taking him out.

661
01:00:55,768 --> 01:00:58,703
Now, do you wanna register
a complaint, boy?

662
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:02,200
To register a complaint,
you've got to have evidence, boy.

663
01:01:02,275 --> 01:01:03,833
You got evidence?

664
01:01:04,844 --> 01:01:06,471
You got a big mouth, boy.

665
01:01:06,546 --> 01:01:09,174
Making accusations
and disturbing the peace.

666
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:13,275
We got a law in this county protecting
innocent folks from bigmouths like you.

667
01:01:13,353 --> 01:01:15,184
- I'd hate to...
- Hector.

668
01:01:54,827 --> 01:01:57,455
Never mind, Tim. We're not licked yet.

669
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,390
Ain't we? I am.

670
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:03,794
There comes a time, Tim...

671
01:02:04,904 --> 01:02:07,634
when a man has just got to do something.

672
01:02:10,343 --> 01:02:12,971
Not me. I'm useless and I know it.

673
01:02:14,514 --> 01:02:17,483
No man is useless
so long as he's got a friend.

674
01:02:18,751 --> 01:02:20,582
I'm your friend, Tim.

675
01:02:22,088 --> 01:02:24,488
Then why don't you let me alone?

676
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:28,360
Because he's going to need you
before the night's over.

677
01:02:28,428 --> 01:02:31,329
And all the useful men
are on the other side.

678
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:33,331
Let me alone, I tell you!

679
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:35,264
I can't let you alone!

680
01:02:35,435 --> 01:02:38,495
I can't let myself alone.
Don't you understand that?

681
01:02:40,573 --> 01:02:43,565
Four years ago,
something terrible happened here.

682
01:02:43,643 --> 01:02:46,111
We did nothing about it. Nothing!

683
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:49,876
The whole town fell into
a sort of settled melancholy...

684
01:02:49,949 --> 01:02:54,079
and all the people in it closed their eyes
and held their tongues...

685
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:58,213
and failed the test with a whimper.

686
01:02:58,491 --> 01:03:01,324
Now something terrible
is going to happen again.

687
01:03:01,394 --> 01:03:05,558
And in a way, we're lucky,
'cause we've been given a second chance.

688
01:03:05,765 --> 01:03:09,360
I've got such a headache, I'm bewildered.
I hurt all over.

689
01:03:10,236 --> 01:03:12,704
Yeah, pain is bewildering. I know.

690
01:03:13,072 --> 01:03:15,563
I was bewildered when I came here.

691
01:03:15,808 --> 01:03:20,211
Full of self-pity.
But your friend Smith tried to kill me.

692
01:03:20,746 --> 01:03:23,010
It's strange how a man
will cling to the earth...

693
01:03:23,082 --> 01:03:25,346
when he feels
he isn't going to see it again.

694
01:03:25,418 --> 01:03:29,548
There's lot of difference between
clinging to it and crawling on the earth.

695
01:03:29,622 --> 01:03:32,352
Are you going to stand by
and watch forever?

696
01:03:35,294 --> 01:03:37,091
I ain't gonna watch.

697
01:03:37,964 --> 01:03:41,365
And I ain't gonna get into anything.

698
01:03:43,469 --> 01:03:45,096
I'm getting out.

699
01:03:49,609 --> 01:03:51,668
I'm sorry, Mr. Macreedy.

700
01:03:57,283 --> 01:03:59,843
You'd be smart to get out, too, Doc.

701
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,089
There's too many smart guys around here.
I'm glad I'm a dummy.

702
01:04:04,156 --> 01:04:07,489
You're a troublesome dummy.
You're liable to end up on your own slab.

703
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,256
I expect to be in a lot more trouble
before I die...

704
01:04:10,329 --> 01:04:12,729
Go home, Doc. He's all washed-up.

705
01:04:13,065 --> 01:04:14,589
You think so?

706
01:04:17,069 --> 01:04:19,936
I was washed-up when I got off that train.

707
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,598
- You shouldn't have got off.
- I had to.

708
01:04:23,676 --> 01:04:27,840
I had one last duty to perform
before I resigned from the human race.

709
01:04:27,914 --> 01:04:31,873
I thought you were going to Los Angeles.
That hotbed of pomp and vanity.

710
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,442
Is that what you call
resigning from the human race?

711
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,921
Good jumping-off place
for South America, the islands.

712
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:39,116
Why?

713
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:43,728
I don't know. I guess I was just looking
for some place to get lost.

714
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,957
Why do you want to get lost?

715
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:50,500
Because I was afraid
I couldn't function any longer.

716
01:04:50,937 --> 01:04:53,804
Luckily, your friend Smith
changed my mind.

717
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,438
- Sure, you're a man of action.
- I know what your trouble is, sonny.

718
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:03,582
You'd like me to die quickly, wouldn't you?
Without wasting too much of your time.

719
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:07,141
Or quietly,
so I won't embarrass you too much.

720
01:05:07,219 --> 01:05:09,153
Or even thankfully...

721
01:05:09,355 --> 01:05:12,882
so your memory of the occasion
won't be too unpleasant.

722
01:05:16,295 --> 01:05:18,263
My memories are so pleasant, as it is.

723
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,994
It's gonna take an awful lot of whiskey
to wash out your guts.

724
01:05:25,071 --> 01:05:27,062
Go on, swill it!

725
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,307
What is there left for you to do?

726
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:31,502
You're as dead as Komako,
and you don't know it.

727
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:33,272
Take it easy. Sit down.

728
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,507
Sit down?
Why don't you tell me to kneel down...

729
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:38,311
and beg his pardon
for bringing up an unpleasant subject?

730
01:05:38,384 --> 01:05:40,682
You don't have to remind me.
I've never forgotten.

731
01:05:40,753 --> 01:05:42,118
Isn't that noble of you?

732
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:46,420
You haven't forgotten and
you're ashamed. That's really noble of you.

733
01:05:46,892 --> 01:05:49,690
I suppose four years from now,
you'll be sitting here...

734
01:05:49,762 --> 01:05:52,458
telling people
you haven't forgotten me, either.

735
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,362
That's real progress.

736
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,333
In the meantime, I'll be as dead as a...

737
01:05:57,603 --> 01:06:00,128
Why don't you tell me what happened?

738
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,036
What happened?

739
01:06:05,745 --> 01:06:07,235
Why did you come here, Mr. Macreedy?

740
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:14,886
Did Komako have any other family
besides his son, Joe?

741
01:06:14,954 --> 01:06:18,117
Son? Nobody around here
ever knew he had a son.

742
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:21,751
Yes, he had a son. He's dead, too.
He's buried in Italy.

743
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,095
I asked you before:
Why did you come here?

744
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:31,662
Why, this Komako boy died
trying to save my life.

745
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,168
They gave him a medal.

746
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,140
I came here to give it to his old man.

747
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:39,939
I figured the least I could do
was give him one day out of my life.

748
01:06:40,846 --> 01:06:43,838
Well, are you gonna tell him
or have I got to?

749
01:06:44,984 --> 01:06:46,542
I'll tell him.

750
01:06:46,819 --> 01:06:49,913
Smith owned Adobe Flat.
He leased it to Komako.

751
01:06:50,389 --> 01:06:54,587
He figured he cheated him because
you gotta have water to raise anything.

752
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,424
There never was any water on Adobe Flat.

753
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:03,793
Komako dug a well.
He must have gone down 60 feet.

754
01:07:04,203 --> 01:07:07,639
He got plenty of water.
That made Smith pretty sore.

755
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:10,801
He didn't like Japs anyway.

756
01:07:13,579 --> 01:07:17,481
The day after Pearl Harbor,
Smith went to Sand City.

757
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:20,951
Yeah, he got turned down. Tried to enlist.

758
01:07:21,854 --> 01:07:24,448
When he got back, he was pretty sore.

759
01:07:25,491 --> 01:07:28,085
Around 10:00, we all started drinking.

760
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,889
10:00 in the morning?

761
01:07:31,731 --> 01:07:34,928
Smith, Coley, Sam, Hector, and me.

762
01:07:36,702 --> 01:07:38,329
We were all drunk.

763
01:07:39,538 --> 01:07:41,165
Patriotic drunk.

764
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,035
We wanted to go out to scare
the Jap a little and have a little fun.

765
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:48,842
When we got there,
he heard us coming and locked the door.

766
01:07:50,382 --> 01:07:52,714
Then Smith started a fire...

767
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,817
and the Jap came running out.
His clothes were all burning.

768
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:00,625
And then Smith shot him.

769
01:08:01,627 --> 01:08:03,993
I didn't even know he had a gun.

770
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:10,632
Then you got scared and buried him,
and kept your mouth shut?

771
01:08:11,437 --> 01:08:12,529
Yeah.

772
01:08:16,075 --> 01:08:19,806
Well, go ahead and have your drink.
You're going to need it.

773
01:08:43,502 --> 01:08:45,197
Hello, Liz. Pete.

774
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:49,038
Listen, I'm getting Macreedy out of town.

775
01:08:49,108 --> 01:08:52,509
I would call the police,
but all the outside lines are cut.

776
01:08:52,578 --> 01:08:55,206
Let him try. I might as well be dead.

777
01:08:56,749 --> 01:08:58,614
Yeah, I told him everything.

778
01:08:58,684 --> 01:09:02,176
Never mind about that.
I'm asking you because I need your help.

779
01:09:02,254 --> 01:09:03,653
You'd be saving two lives, Liz:

780
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:06,850
Macreedy's and mine,
if that means anything to you.

781
01:09:06,926 --> 01:09:08,188
All right.

782
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:11,395
Now, here's what I want you to do.

783
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:12,754
Wait till it's dark.

784
01:10:41,287 --> 01:10:44,017
I've been looking for you. Come here.

785
01:10:56,468 --> 01:10:58,129
What do you want?

786
01:10:59,305 --> 01:11:01,432
Macreedy. He went up to bed.

787
01:11:01,607 --> 01:11:04,075
So, you want me to tuck him in?

788
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:07,838
No, but I thought
maybe you ought to tell Smith.

789
01:11:09,048 --> 01:11:13,348
Smith don't want to be disturbed.
He'll be here at midnight, he said.

790
01:11:14,253 --> 01:11:16,221
Why are you so nervous?

791
01:11:16,388 --> 01:11:18,856
What do you mean? I'm not nervous.

792
01:11:18,991 --> 01:11:20,583
You got a match?

793
01:11:20,993 --> 01:11:23,154
No, I got some in the lobby.

794
01:13:05,864 --> 01:13:09,630
What did you do to get Pete
to change his mind? Beat him up?

795
01:13:10,235 --> 01:13:11,759
No, no muscle.

796
01:13:12,404 --> 01:13:15,999
Not with brains, either.
He's a pushover for a muscleman.

797
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:18,868
I'm beginning to think
it runs in the family.

798
01:13:19,378 --> 01:13:22,836
I'd sure like to have seen you tangle
with Reno Smith.

799
01:13:23,348 --> 01:13:25,976
He didn't happen to be there when I left.

800
01:13:26,051 --> 01:13:27,814
Maybe I will yet.

801
01:13:37,096 --> 01:13:39,758
- What's this?
- Need water.

802
01:13:49,975 --> 01:13:51,169
Smitty?

803
01:13:53,412 --> 01:13:57,610
Liz, you fool.
If he gets me, he's gotta get you.

804
01:13:59,985 --> 01:14:03,318
I'm here, honey. Head for the car.

805
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:06,187
So long, Macreedy.

806
01:14:10,596 --> 01:14:12,587
A few more steps, honey.

807
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:15,265
Get him. Get him now.

808
01:14:15,767 --> 01:14:17,826
First things first, honey.

809
01:14:18,604 --> 01:14:20,401
Help me up, Smitty.

810
01:14:20,739 --> 01:14:22,900
You were gonna help me, Liz.

811
01:14:23,475 --> 01:14:25,466
I still need your help.

812
01:14:26,011 --> 01:14:28,070
I did everything you said.

813
01:14:28,247 --> 01:14:30,579
You two started out in the car.

814
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:35,513
And that's the way you're gonna end up.
Over a cliff, burning.

815
01:14:35,954 --> 01:14:39,685
You can blame Macreedy for that.
He said I had too many witnesses.

816
01:14:39,758 --> 01:14:42,989
Why me? Why start with me?

817
01:14:43,996 --> 01:14:46,157
I gotta start with somebody.

818
01:17:56,054 --> 01:17:57,282
Save me!

819
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,525
Am I going to have trouble with you?

820
01:18:45,237 --> 01:18:49,606
No. But I sure thought the situation
was gonna be reversed.

821
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:52,939
I thought that
I was gonna have trouble with him.

822
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,914
I'll take care of him.

823
01:19:08,627 --> 01:19:10,959
The gang's all here, all right.

824
01:19:13,532 --> 01:19:16,399
Thought I'd take one last whack at my job.

825
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:19,493
Your sister's out in the car, Pete.

826
01:19:20,038 --> 01:19:21,471
She's dead.

827
01:19:23,275 --> 01:19:26,142
Do you want me to tell you who killed her?

828
01:19:27,145 --> 01:19:29,045
I know who killed her.

829
01:19:36,154 --> 01:19:38,554
About that medal? Can we have it?

830
01:19:39,424 --> 01:19:42,325
- "Can we have it?" Who's "we"?
- We. Us.

831
01:19:44,162 --> 01:19:45,424
Why?

832
01:19:50,001 --> 01:19:51,764
Maybe we need it.

833
01:19:51,837 --> 01:19:54,397
Maybe give us something to build on.

834
01:19:54,806 --> 01:19:57,673
This town's wrecked,
