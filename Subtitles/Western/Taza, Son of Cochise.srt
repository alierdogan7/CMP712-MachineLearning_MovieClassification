1
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:27,045
<i>In 1872,</i>

2
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:31,679
<i>the long bitter war fought
between the United States caValry</i>

3
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:36,479
<i>and the Apache bands
led by Cochise came to an end.</i>

4
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:41,042
<i>The peace treaty signed
by Cochise and General Howard</i>

5
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:43,921
<i>brought peace to the
Arizona territory.</i>

6
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:46,759
<i>But three years later,</i>

7
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:51,119
<i>the mighty leader
of the Chiricahua Apaches grew ill</i>

8
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:54,366
<i>and came to the end of his days.</i>

9
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:11,396
My sons.

10
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:18,717
Hear the words of Cochise

11
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:21,359
for the last time.

12
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:40,080
Taza, mi first son,

13
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:45,564
lead the Chiricahuas
as I have led them.

14
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:50,085
Honor the peace
we have made with the White Eyes.

15
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:54,721
Think only and always
for our people.

16
00:02:57,647 --> 00:03:00,844
Naiche, my second son,

17
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:05,355
follow your brother and defend him

18
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:09,000
so long as he defends
the ways of Cochise.

19
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:11,485
One last wish.

20
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:17,275
Let no White Eyes find the ground
where Cochise makes the big sleep.

21
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:30,881
It is done.

22
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:34,120
My father's spirit joins the Sun.

23
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:45,362
No White Eyes
will ever see this grave.

24
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,916
Now Cochise
begins his big sleep.

25
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:29,920
<i>News of the death of Cochise
reached the Ione Apache Chieftain</i>

26
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,117
<i>who continued
to ride the paths of war.</i>

27
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,163
His name was Geronimo.

28
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:35,961
Where is Geronimo?

29
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:37,916
Geronimo.

30
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:40,045
- The soldier coats are coming?
- No.

31
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:43,159
I bring the word of Grey Eagle.
Cochise has died.

32
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,680
- When did you leave?
- Two days and two nights ago.

33
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,758
They're taking him to the top

34
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:50,997
so that no White Eyes
could find his grave.

35
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:54,244
Good. Geronimo will again lead
a strong Apache nation.

36
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:58,555
For peace will die with Cochise
on the Chiricahua Mountain.

37
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,526
Stay here, Chato!

38
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:32,836
Naiche!

39
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,559
The ceremony is over, brother.

40
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,963
- It is time to laugh.
- Find someone else.

41
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:41,521
I have found her.
Her name is Oona.

42
00:06:41,607 --> 00:06:43,643
- She is beautiful.
- And she hates Naiche.

43
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:46,646
Her words mean nothing.
Her father favors me.

44
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,282
'Cause I don't speak
the ways of women, of cowards.

45
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,437
'Cause I want to live like a warrior

46
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,523
by the lance,
the arrow and the knife.

47
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:54,996
Go back to the village.

48
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,601
Our father fought for 11 years
to win our peace with honor.

49
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:06,078
- Now you speaking of breaking it.
- I wait only for Geronimo.

50
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:08,676
- When he returns, I'll join him.
- You never will.

51
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:10,958
No while I lead the Chiricahuas.

52
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:14,636
Taza!

53
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:04,246
Why don't you kill him?

54
00:08:07,207 --> 00:08:09,004
Kill him! Kill him!

55
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:12,756
- He is my brother.
- But he bears evil for us.

56
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:14,366
And for our people.

57
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,882
Take him back to the village
and put him under the guard.

58
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:22,765
- Why did you leave the other women?
- I knew you were sad.

59
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,685
I wanted to be near you.

60
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:31,485
I must come back to the village.
My father would be worried.

61
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:34,884
Soon you will be my worry,
not Grey Eagle's.

62
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:36,440
You forget Naiche.

63
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:38,166
I will not forget him.

64
00:08:38,847 --> 00:08:40,838
But now I can think only of you.

65
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,964
Kocha, get your rifle.

66
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:23,121
Watch him well.

67
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:52,002
My father.

68
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:19,040
Jeb, Aaron.

69
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,322
- What's wrong, Mary?
- Something scared the horses.

70
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,637
- Maybe Indians.
- Indians?

71
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:34,719
Don't start fretting.
This is Chiricahua country.

72
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,357
Only peaceful Redskins live here.

73
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:39,006
And Cochise...

74
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:19,242
Kocha, did you hear something?

75
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:53,677
Naiche, throw down your gun.

76
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:34,756
Troops!

77
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:36,436
Halt!

78
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:39,036
Halt!

79
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:41,486
- Lieutenant Willis.
- Yes, sir.

80
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:44,998
Water your horses.
Keep the men out of the village.

81
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:48,722
You better tell your man
not to dismount and not to relax.

82
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:50,402
What's wrong, Hegan?

83
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,326
I don't reckon
we'll get to talk to Cochise.

84
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:58,802
The chief's feather is being worn
by Cochise's eldest son, Taza.

85
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:02,916
What's he like?

86
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:06,284
He's got it in him to be
a greater chief than Cochise

87
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,802
or a worse devil than Geronimo.

88
00:17:11,687 --> 00:17:13,120
- Alert your men.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:47,039
- It's good to see you.
- Thank you, Taza. Thank you.

90
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:52,160
Captain Burnett, the new Soldier Chief
of the San Carlos reservation.

91
00:17:57,807 --> 00:18:00,162
The Captain came to talk to Cochise.

92
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:02,363
Is about the killing
of the three White Eyes?

93
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:05,206
Yes, they're killed near your village.

94
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:08,320
Tell me,
has Geronimo been around here?

95
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:11,116
We figured it was
some of his dirty work.

96
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:14,762
It was not Geronimo.
Some of my people are to blame.

97
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:19,195
Walk with me.

98
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:42,999
These are the evil ones.

99
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:53,205
But that's your brother Naiche.

100
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:56,040
I'll have to take
these six Chiricahuas to Fort Apache.

101
00:18:57,567 --> 00:19:00,240
- These men must be punished.
- Look again, Captain.

102
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:02,880
They are being punished.

103
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:05,516
Captain,
Taza is giving it to you straight.

104
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,161
Facing a firing squad,
that's an honorable thing,

105
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,125
but being punished like this
makes them lose face.

106
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:13,442
There's nothing worse for an Apache.

107
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:18,601
- You've broken the treaty.
- Some of my men have.

108
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:20,366
I've punished them.

109
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:22,956
I'm sorry, Taza.
I have my orders.

110
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:26,721
Forward!

111
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:38,403
As I understand the treaty,
if any Chiricahua kills a white man,

112
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:41,923
the tribe must surrender their arms
and move to the reservation.

113
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,958
This is up to General Crook.

114
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:47,876
He's due back to Fort Apache tomorrow.
You can appeal to him if you wish.

115
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:52,326
I had a wish for peace.

116
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:54,725
Lieutenant Willis.

117
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,156
Yes, sir.

118
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,166
We're taking this men.

119
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:01,842
Sergeant Hamma and four men,
over here.

120
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:03,720
May I have your knife, Hegan?

121
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,167
I remember when the Apaches
were proud and brave.

122
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:13,397
You spoke those words to my father.

123
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:27,596
Sergeant.

124
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:31,523
- Taza!
- Dismount!

125
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:34,560
Dismount!

126
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:37,963
- Lieutenant Willis.
- Yeah.

127
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:41,962
- He tried to take my sword.
- How? He was half dead.

128
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:54,236
Taza, I regret this very much.

129
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:57,883
This was the very thing
I tried to avoid.

130
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,475
The last thing I wanted to happen.
I'm sorry.

131
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:03,161
Hurry it up, men!

132
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,879
Sergeant, prepare to move out.

133
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:08,957
Troop! To mount!

134
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,325
Even Cochise
wouldn't let this go unpunished.

135
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:14,999
I'll do what must be done.

136
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:27,557
Company, left wheel!

137
00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:29,798
Forward, march!

138
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:00,797
This is the place

139
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,237
the White Eyes call Fort Apache.

140
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:00,278
Three sentries have been posted.

141
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:02,517
Alright. Tank you.
Good night.

142
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,796
Good night, sir.

143
00:23:06,047 --> 00:23:08,356
If I were you
I would sleep my boots on.

144
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:09,756
We have sentries posted.

145
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:12,606
I'd feel better if we had
Taza behind bars.

146
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:16,317
- Better still in front of a firing squad.
- Good night.

147
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:18,326
Good night, Captain.

148
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:29,244
General Crook and his soldiers.

149
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:31,520
Open the gates for them.

150
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:25,399
Where were your sentries, asleep?

151
00:26:25,447 --> 00:26:27,881
They're on duty, General.
They didn't know what hit them.

152
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:31,126
General Crook, this is Taza,
Chief of the Chiricahuas.

153
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:33,437
- Is Cochise dead?
- He died five days ago.

154
00:26:33,527 --> 00:26:36,325
- I knew peace would die with your father.
- I did not want it so.

155
00:26:36,687 --> 00:26:40,441
- I warned the Captain.
- You ordered me to capture the Apaches.

156
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:41,761
- I did.
- You did right.

157
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:43,559
We'll not talk of right or wrong.

158
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:45,479
- We'll talk of peace.
- Peace?

159
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,166
He means it, General.

160
00:26:47,327 --> 00:26:49,318
Your soldier coats
are my prisoners.

161
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:52,321
I'll release them
if you fulfill my demands.

162
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:54,116
What are they?

163
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,684
San Carlos is an empty land.
It's wrong to send us there.

164
00:26:57,887 --> 00:27:01,243
It's according to the treaty.
Cochise signed it and you broke it.

165
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:04,598
Why should my people be punished
for the evil done by six Chiricahuas?

166
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:07,597
If you want peace,
you must agree to this.

167
00:27:08,287 --> 00:27:10,118
Let White Eyes punish White Eyes.

168
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:13,166
- And Apaches punish Apaches.
- Impossible.

169
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:16,281
Light the torches!

170
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:18,637
- He punished the six Apaches.
- That's so.

171
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,359
If I hasn't seen it
I wouldn't believe it.

172
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:24,566
The authority for punishing crimes
rests with the United States government.

173
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:26,280
Set fire to the fort!

174
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:39,164
Do we talk peace
or do I ride with Geronimo?

175
00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:41,323
- Hear him out.
- What are your demands?

176
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:43,717
I have no wish to break my father's word.

177
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:46,244
We will move to the reservation.

178
00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:50,562
We must have tools
to work the land, seed and sheep.

179
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:53,441
- Enough food 'til we grow our own.
- Alright.

180
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:55,126
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

181
00:27:55,647 --> 00:27:56,841
One more thing.

182
00:27:58,047 --> 00:27:59,799
No soldier coats in the reservation.

183
00:28:00,007 --> 00:28:01,645
- You must be policed.
- We'll police ourselves.

184
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:03,399
That's the army's function.
I'll never agree to that.

185
00:28:03,527 --> 00:28:06,200
Let's Taza form
a Reservation Police Force.

186
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:09,041
- As an auxiliary to the army.
- Armed?

187
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,486
- And uniformed.
- This I will do.

188
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:14,446
Are you willing to accept it
even it jeopardizes your army career?

189
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:17,160
I realize that, sir.
But I trust Taza.

190
00:28:17,727 --> 00:28:19,365
Well. I agree.

191
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:26,286
Release the captives!

192
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:33,719
I will never betray you, Nantan.

193
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:35,002
"Nantan"?

194
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:37,678
When an Apache calls you "Nantan",

195
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:41,120
he means you're a great leader,
a good friend.

196
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:43,919
And he will protect you with his life.

197
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,240
Put out the fire!

198
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:02,325
<i>Weeks later,
the Apache nation led by Taza</i>

199
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:07,237
<i>left their beloVed mountains
and moVed to the San Carlos Reservation.</i>

200
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:33,239
Taza, come in.

201
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:37,925
I have your uniforms.

202
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:44,886
- Well, it's yours.
- My people are restless.

203
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:48,043
They keep asking about the tools.

204
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:50,442
The seed, the sheep you promised.

205
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:52,956
They're on their way.
Should be here tomorrow.

206
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:55,116
Tomorrow?

207
00:29:56,407 --> 00:29:58,284
- Good.
- Try for size.

208
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:03,682
It will easier fit my body,
than my mind.

209
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:11,206
- What is it?
- Message from Fort Apache.

210
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:16,717
The Sixth Cavalry
has captured Geronimo.

211
00:30:18,127 --> 00:30:21,164
Captured? Geronimo?

212
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:22,276
Yes.

213
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:27,237
Will he and his people be brought here
in the reservation?

214
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:28,157
Certainly.

215
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:32,045
They'll be here in a few days.

216
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:34,239
We'll be ready for them.

217
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:46,556
Taza!

218
00:30:47,327 --> 00:30:48,316
It's yours.

219
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:51,883
- Fine horse.
- Courtesy of the Army.

220
00:30:52,407 --> 00:30:53,522
Thank you, Nantan.

221
00:31:01,087 --> 00:31:03,237
Detail!
Prepare to mount!

222
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:04,716
Mount!

223
00:31:06,927 --> 00:31:07,962
Good luck.

224
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:10,003
Forward!

225
00:31:37,727 --> 00:31:41,720
- What is it?
- Geronimo was captured by soldiers.

226
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:43,240
Our last hope.

227
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:45,403
Maybe they'll bring him
in the reservation.

228
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:48,120
- Without his weapons.
- He is still Geronimo.

229
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:50,797
With him here
we'll find our way out to this...

230
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:16,556
Detail!
Prepare to dismount!

231
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:17,996
Dismount!

232
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:20,641
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir?

233
00:32:20,727 --> 00:32:22,445
Break out the uniforms
and the equipment.

234
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:23,516
Yes, sir.

235
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:27,085
Taza, it's up to you now.
Good luck.

236
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:36,200
He led us to this barren land
and now he betrays us.

237
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:37,641
Father, that's not true.

238
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:41,004
He moved us here to keep the peace.
He thinks of his people.

239
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:43,003
In her father's presence
a girl should hold her tongue.

240
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:47,842
I trust no one
who wears a soldier coat.

241
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:07,237
Last night at the council fire,

242
00:33:07,807 --> 00:33:11,641
I told you evil Apaches
would not be punished by the White Eyes

243
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:13,958
but by the Apache Reservation Police.

244
00:33:15,047 --> 00:33:18,596
I'll choose these policemen
from among our warriors.

245
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:21,117
It is strange to see
an Apache wear a soldier coat.

246
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:22,920
You must trust me.

247
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:29,396
Hear me!

248
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:32,203
I want warriors
for the Reservation Police.

249
00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:34,797
I want Apaches
who think of their people.

250
00:34:35,327 --> 00:34:38,080
Who are able, if they have to,
to punish a friend,

251
00:34:38,487 --> 00:34:40,682
a father or a brother.

252
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:44,477
Come forward when you hear
your name, if you can do what I ask.

253
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:46,120
Chato! Tubac!

254
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:50,956
Naiche.

255
00:34:57,167 --> 00:35:00,603
Naiche, do not turn your back
on your people.

256
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:08,802
Kayita!

257
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,596
Eskina!

258
00:35:11,727 --> 00:35:12,716
Maco!

259
00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:29,636
Oona.

260
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:31,356
What's wrong?

261
00:35:31,807 --> 00:35:34,605
Nothing, Taza.
You just startled me.

262
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:36,480
I saw a look of trouble.

263
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:42,243
I look at you, Taza,
and I see a soldier coat.

264
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,166
Which my father hates.

265
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:48,806
Grey Eagle is old.
He has old wounds, old hates.

266
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:51,566
I have to live with them.

267
00:35:52,207 --> 00:35:55,404
Not for too long.
Soon I'll take you for my wife.

268
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:58,322
When? How soon?

269
00:35:59,847 --> 00:36:03,157
When I can settle our people
I'll think of you and me.

270
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:05,916
Forgive me, Taza,
for giving you grief.

271
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:08,084
I know your burden is heavy.

272
00:36:09,607 --> 00:36:10,596
Oona.

273
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:16,197
- Have faith in me.
- I have, Taza, I have.

274
00:36:21,487 --> 00:36:22,476
Come in.

275
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:26,520
- What is it?
- Geronimo.

276
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:28,719
He'll be here before sunset.

277
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,355
- How did you find it out?
- I saw smoke signals at dawn.

278
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:35,839
He was answered by the Jicarillas
and my Chiricahua.

279
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,443
Geronimo has been guarded
by the Sixth Cavalry.

280
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:40,722
How could he be sneaking out
smoke signals?

281
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:43,241
- Squaws at cook fires.
- I'll be darned.

282
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,158
It takes an Apache
to watch an Apache.

283
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:47,562
Taza, keep a close eye on Geronimo.

284
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,964
Where do you plan
to let them build their wickiups?

285
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:52,286
Next to my Chiricahua.

286
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:54,400
We'll see if he makes no trouble.

287
00:36:54,687 --> 00:36:57,565
- Has Geronimo many followers?
- His names is magic.

288
00:36:58,327 --> 00:37:01,478
They're many who would ride with him
if they had guns.

289
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:41,156
Taza.

290
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:49,965
Better I be blind than see
an Apache in a soldier coat.

291
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:52,123
Geronimo has been blind
to the ways of peace.

292
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:53,805
You mean, the ways of Cochise.

293
00:37:54,127 --> 00:37:57,039
The hate I had for your father
I now have for you.

294
00:37:57,087 --> 00:38:00,318
Just as Cochise did,
I will always challenge you.

295
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:27,039
Geronimo,
Chief of the Mogollon Apaches.

296
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:28,920
And Lobo, his lieutenant.

297
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,565
- How many are they?
- 27 warriors, 7 women and 10 kids.

298
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:34,684
44 in all. That tallies.

299
00:38:35,327 --> 00:38:37,841
Geronimo, I hope
we'll walk together in peace.

300
00:38:38,127 --> 00:38:39,321
Never in peace.

301
00:38:40,127 --> 00:38:41,958
I leave you to the Reservation Police.

302
00:38:42,527 --> 00:38:45,519
- Give them instructions and report me.
- Yes, Nantan.

303
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:46,962
"Nantan"!

304
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:49,920
The Captain is our friend.

305
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:52,797
Because of him
you are not in Fort Apache.

306
00:38:52,887 --> 00:38:54,605
Anyone in a soldier coat
is my enemy.

307
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:57,115
Have you not had enough of fighting?

308
00:38:57,367 --> 00:39:00,006
Of stealing and killing.
Of hunger and cold...

309
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:04,995
We'll give you blankets and food.
Start building the wickiups.

310
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,156
Geronimo.

311
00:40:05,927 --> 00:40:07,360
Where is Taza is taking Geronimo?

312
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:09,921
An hour from here,
the Redsand Mountains.

313
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:16,241
Where's my daughter?

314
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:18,877
Find Taza and you'll find Oona.

315
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:33,516
Taza!

316
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:36,486
I'll join you later.

317
00:40:50,727 --> 00:40:53,560
Taza,
you must take me away from here.

318
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:55,838
I can't without the word of your father.

319
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:58,715
That is the Apache law and it is sacred.

320
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,801
Would you not break the law,
even for me?

321
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,399
We can't think of you and me now.

322
00:41:04,847 --> 00:41:08,283
When Geronimo is settled,
I'll bring presents to your father.

323
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:10,803
Make it soon, please!

324
00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:16,161
There were smoke signals from our village.
Did you see them?

325
00:41:18,047 --> 00:41:19,036
Was it Naiche?

326
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:21,556
What is wrong?

327
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:23,839
I feel we're being watched.

328
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:28,478
No one is there.
This is important.

329
00:41:28,647 --> 00:41:29,966
Who gave the signals?

330
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:34,196
- Naiche, Skinya and...
- And?

331
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:35,636
And my father.

332
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:40,598
If you hear any word of a breakout,
you must tell me.

333
00:41:41,007 --> 00:41:43,601
I will. I will.

334
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:06,521
Taza is an enemy.
You will tell him nothing.

335
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:30,643
- Here you'll built your wickiups.
- Then what?

336
00:42:30,807 --> 00:42:34,083
Do we sit here on this evil land?
We'll starve to death.

337
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:37,125
- You'll be given sheep and corn.
- Corn?

338
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:41,079
Sheep?
We are warriors, hunters.

339
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:42,516
Not traitors.

340
00:42:43,487 --> 00:42:46,684
- Like that Taza.
- You betrayed the Apache with war.

341
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:48,366
With the talk of war.

342
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:52,196
I warn you now,
do not make a wrong move.

343
00:42:53,007 --> 00:42:54,076
Yeah.

344
00:43:17,047 --> 00:43:21,723
There is no warrior as brave,
as strong or as wise as Geronimo.

345
00:43:22,487 --> 00:43:24,478
- Yet he let the soldiers take him.
- Why?

346
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:26,844
The soldiers gave us no rest.

347
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:31,237
Food was gone,
our horses worn out, no bullets.

348
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,718
And now Geronimo
will plant corn and raise sheep.

349
00:43:35,527 --> 00:43:37,245
Not while I have money...

350
00:43:38,287 --> 00:43:39,845
300 dollars.

351
00:43:40,447 --> 00:43:44,599
I took this from the White Eyes
and I'll give it back for bullets.

352
00:43:45,087 --> 00:43:47,396
300 dollars.
This is good.

353
00:43:47,647 --> 00:43:51,242
It is only talk if we don't find
someone who will sell us what we want.

354
00:43:51,407 --> 00:43:55,036
- We know someone.
- His name is Tiswin. One day to the North.

355
00:43:56,087 --> 00:43:57,236
The police coats!

356
00:44:07,647 --> 00:44:08,921
What can we do?

357
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:11,836
Taza and his soldiers
watch every move we make.

358
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:15,676
We'd have to bring
the stupid White Eyes instead of Taza.

359
00:44:15,727 --> 00:44:17,877
If someone kills Taza's friend,
Captain Burnett...

360
00:44:17,927 --> 00:44:22,125
The Great Soldier Chief would have
to put and end to the Police.

361
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:54,316
Oona.

362
00:45:07,727 --> 00:45:08,762
Grey Eagle?

363
00:45:11,727 --> 00:45:13,126
He watched us last night.

364
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:15,040
He heard what we said.

365
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:19,121
- I'll kill him.
- No, Taza, you must not.

366
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:22,115
- My father has a right to beat me.
- I know the Apache law.

367
00:45:22,407 --> 00:45:24,238
You did nothing to be punished for.

368
00:45:25,287 --> 00:45:28,438
Taza, I could not sleep last night.

369
00:45:29,847 --> 00:45:32,077
- The pain will go away.
- It is not that.

370
00:45:32,447 --> 00:45:35,439
My father has a gun hidden.
Last night he gave it to Lobo.

371
00:45:37,247 --> 00:45:39,681
If your father wanted to kill me,
he'd do it himself.

372
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,403
The bullets are meant
for someone else.

373
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:45,362
Please, Taza, be careful.

374
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:49,402
Tomorrow I'll bring presents
to your father

375
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:51,325
and take you as my wife.

376
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:56,479
But now I must find Lobo.

377
00:46:04,767 --> 00:46:05,882
Chiricahuas!

378
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,202
The White Eyes
have kept the promise.

379
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:12,804
They have send us the plows,
the seed corn and the sheep.

380
00:46:13,847 --> 00:46:17,317
The squawks must bring their baskets.
We'll fill them with seed.

381
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:24,078
I have something to say to Grey Eagle.

382
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:29,160
- What is it?
- I want Oona for my wife.

383
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:32,440
I'll give my daughter
to whom brings me the right presents.

384
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:34,923
- What do you want?
- Guns and bullets.

385
00:46:35,447 --> 00:46:37,438
The White Eyes
will not let Apaches have guns.

386
00:46:37,767 --> 00:46:39,280
The Reservation Police have.

387
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:41,046
I have none to give.

388
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:44,278
You asked me what I wanted.

389
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:46,444
I'll bring you my presents tomorrow.

390
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:54,685
- Where's Lobo?
- Maybe he plant corn.

391
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:57,242
- You'd wise to talk.
- I'm wise.

392
00:46:57,567 --> 00:47:00,400
- In the ways of an Apache.
- You'll learn nothing from us.

393
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:05,276
Kayita.

394
00:47:06,807 --> 00:47:08,877
Tell Captain Burnett
Lobo is missing.

395
00:47:09,367 --> 00:47:10,595
And that he has a gun.

396
00:47:14,647 --> 00:47:17,445
Taza knows about Lobo.
He looks for him.

397
00:47:17,887 --> 00:47:19,843
I will rip off my daughter's tongue.

398
00:47:23,887 --> 00:47:25,684
Chato, come with me.

399
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,883
We must search all the villages for Lobo.

400
00:48:46,087 --> 00:48:47,236
- Find Lobo?
- No, Captain.

401
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:50,040
- He's headed for Mexico?
- Not without Geronimo.

402
00:48:50,287 --> 00:48:51,640
He must be hiding somewhere.

403
00:48:52,367 --> 00:48:54,927
- Nobody is talking?
- Geronimo knows.

404
00:48:55,527 --> 00:48:56,846
But he'll not talk.

405
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:06,524
I should report this to General Crook.

406
00:49:06,687 --> 00:49:09,042
Give us more time, Captain.
We'll find Lobo.

407
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:11,236
Alright.

408
00:49:12,007 --> 00:49:13,326
You've got 24 hours.

409
00:49:46,687 --> 00:49:47,915
Thanks for saving my neck.

410
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,683
An Apache has punished an Apache.

411
00:50:11,207 --> 00:50:12,196
Geronimo.

412
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:14,356
I found Lobo.

413
00:50:15,687 --> 00:50:16,676
Where is he?

414
00:50:17,327 --> 00:50:20,558
Where his blood was spilled,
in the San Carlos agency,

415
00:50:21,487 --> 00:50:22,476
by me.

416
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:37,002
That was close.

417
00:50:38,007 --> 00:50:38,996
Very close.

418
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:41,562
Too close to my wedding.

419
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:46,601
- Grey Eagle knows I killed Lobo.
- He hates you 'cause of who you are.

420
00:50:47,687 --> 00:50:49,040
- That is not enough.
- It is all I have.

421
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,236
He'll spit at it.

422
00:50:50,687 --> 00:50:51,915
Must I give this?

423
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,276
Taza.

424
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:54,961
- Delay the wedding.
- No.

425
00:50:55,007 --> 00:50:56,360
- For a few days.
- I promised Oona.

426
00:50:56,407 --> 00:50:59,717
- Better break a promise than your heart.
- It must be tomorrow.

427
00:51:21,927 --> 00:51:23,645
Taza? Taza?

428
00:51:28,807 --> 00:51:32,163
It's all for you.
Every warrior gave what it could.

429
00:51:32,767 --> 00:51:34,325
I'll never forget this.

430
00:51:35,007 --> 00:51:37,726
- They're good friends.
- Grey Eagle won't turn his back.

431
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:39,879
- Good morning, Taza.
- Good morning, Nantan.

432
00:51:41,287 --> 00:51:43,084
It's quite a haul.
What's it all about?

433
00:51:43,207 --> 00:51:46,279
- There's gonna be a wedding.
- I'm taking Oona as my wife.

434
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:49,365
My best wishes.
I'll be an honor to have her on the post.

435
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,677
Did you ever see an Apache wedding?

436
00:51:52,047 --> 00:51:54,720
- Lots of colors, lots of victuals.
- No more.

437
00:51:54,807 --> 00:51:58,004
- This land is not like Chiricahua.
- That's too bad.

438
00:51:58,087 --> 00:52:00,555
We'll throw a party
for you and the bride.

439
00:52:00,727 --> 00:52:04,606
Take a wagon to Fort Apache
and come back with six turkeys.

440
00:52:05,007 --> 00:52:06,963
I won't forget the trimming's either.

441
00:52:07,527 --> 00:52:08,721
Thank you, Nantan.

442
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,436
Beautiful!

443
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:27,316
Get away from here!

444
00:52:28,207 --> 00:52:29,879
I came to help you gather willow.

445
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:33,876
They're green and fresh.
That'll make a strong house.

446
00:52:34,207 --> 00:52:36,198
I built my wickiup for Taza.

447
00:52:36,847 --> 00:52:40,044
For a daughter like you,
Grey Eagle will want many presents.

448
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:41,925
He'll get more than enough.

449
00:52:42,687 --> 00:52:44,040
I know he will.

450
00:53:17,287 --> 00:53:19,118
I ask Grey Eagle for his daughter Oona.

451
00:53:27,447 --> 00:53:29,005
Let me see your presents.

452
00:53:34,687 --> 00:53:36,279
These are fine presents.

453
00:53:37,367 --> 00:53:39,005
I'm happy you're pleased.

454
00:53:40,407 --> 00:53:43,399
Is there any other who offers
presents for my daughter?

455
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:44,676
I do.

456
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:54,961
I ask Grey Eagle
for his daughter Oona.

457
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,920
Where are your presents?

458
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:05,115
300 dollars.

459
00:54:05,447 --> 00:54:08,598
- Where did you get the money?
- Hold up the ceremony.

460
00:54:12,927 --> 00:54:15,566
Naiche's presents
are bigger than Taza's.

461
00:54:16,207 --> 00:54:19,279
- Your daughter hates Naiche.
- I want Taza.

462
00:54:19,687 --> 00:54:22,599
If you want Oona,
your presents must be bigger.

463
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:24,400
I have no more to give.

464
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,122
Your soldiers have guns and bullets.

465
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:30,559
- Bring them to me.
- I came here to take a wife

466
00:54:31,127 --> 00:54:32,560
not to betray our people.

467
00:54:37,327 --> 00:54:39,966
Cochise is dead.
Let's bury the peace with him.

468
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:43,007
I'm sick of this reservation
and our lives here.

469
00:54:43,047 --> 00:54:45,197
We need guns and bullets
to break away from here.

470
00:54:45,287 --> 00:54:48,324
I speak my father's words.
You speak Geronimo's.

471
00:54:50,447 --> 00:54:52,517
Look at Geronimo, the great warrior.

472
00:54:53,647 --> 00:54:55,717
He came here hungry,
cold and beaten.

473
00:54:55,927 --> 00:54:58,043
He wants to curse us
with war and death.

474
00:54:58,167 --> 00:55:01,079
- Bring and end to the Apache nation.
- Hear me, Taza.

475
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:03,762
I am here to give my daughter as a wife.

476
00:55:04,247 --> 00:55:07,364
Unless you bring me guns,
I'll give Oona to Naiche.

477
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:10,759
I'll never betray my father,
my people or myself.

478
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:13,482
I'll bring no guns for Geronimo

479
00:55:13,607 --> 00:55:14,801
or for Grey Eagle.

480
00:55:17,767 --> 00:55:19,485
I give my daughter to Naiche.

481
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,002
The wedding
will take place in three days.

482
00:55:25,247 --> 00:55:27,317
You shame Cochise.

483
00:55:27,887 --> 00:55:29,957
You shame the Apache nation.

484
00:55:30,687 --> 00:55:33,360
No longer are you my brother.
My blood cries out to kill you.

485
00:55:34,607 --> 00:55:37,246
I'm Chief for the Chiricahuas
so I cannot do this,

486
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:41,961
but if you wrong Oona,
I will tear out your heart.

487
00:56:11,287 --> 00:56:12,766
Taza, are you alone?

488
00:56:14,127 --> 00:56:15,958
Grey Eagle gave Oona to Naiche.

489
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,919
- Did you have a chance?
- I did.

490
00:56:18,087 --> 00:56:19,122
What do you mean?

491
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:21,485
Oona would be mine now,

492
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:25,079
if I have given Grey Eagle
the Police's guns and bullets.

493
00:56:25,567 --> 00:56:28,445
If it means anything to you,
I'm grateful.

494
00:56:28,967 --> 00:56:32,164
I hope your people appreciate
the sacrifice you have made.

495
00:56:33,447 --> 00:56:35,358
I'll never forget what I have done to her.

496
00:56:50,647 --> 00:56:52,080
The drums of the Dolse.

497
00:56:58,127 --> 00:56:59,276
The Chiricahuas.

498
00:57:04,887 --> 00:57:05,876
Captain.

499
00:57:08,127 --> 00:57:09,116
Listen.

500
00:57:22,727 --> 00:57:24,080
The Mescaleros.

501
00:57:30,167 --> 00:57:31,236
Who is talking?

502
00:57:31,807 --> 00:57:36,323
The Mescaleros, the Dolse
and the Chiricahuas.

503
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:37,556
What are they saying?

504
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:42,277
- The Coyoteros.
- What's it all about?

505
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:44,035
The drums say

506
00:57:44,487 --> 00:57:47,524
all Apache warriors
must be ready to fight

507
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:49,361
or die.

508
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:54,085
Because the soldiers
will come soon to kill them.

509
00:57:54,327 --> 00:57:57,285
- That's crazy.
- They don't go in for idle talk.

510
00:57:57,647 --> 00:58:00,400
Geronimo and many Apaches

511
00:58:01,247 --> 00:58:04,398
- have broken out.
- Rush back to your people.

512
00:58:04,527 --> 00:58:07,246
No harm will come
to anyone that doesn't leave.

513
00:58:07,607 --> 00:58:10,326
- I'll notify General Crook.
- Captain.

514
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,847
The Chiricahuas
will no longer follow me.

515
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:16,199
- They'll ride with Geronimo.
- I've no choice.

516
00:58:16,287 --> 00:58:19,324
- Those are my orders.
- We'll deal with it.

517
00:58:19,527 --> 00:58:21,438
Only an Apache punish an Apache.

518
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,601
The Jicarillas.

519
00:58:29,367 --> 00:58:30,356
Nantan,

520
00:58:31,287 --> 00:58:32,959
did I give up Oona for nothing?

521
00:58:33,407 --> 00:58:35,967
Alright.
I'll request permission from Crook

522
00:58:36,047 --> 00:58:38,641
to send the Reservation Police
after Geronimo's band.

523
00:58:39,247 --> 00:58:40,839
That's the best I can do.

524
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,956
Nothing yet.

525
01:00:07,327 --> 01:00:09,238
- This it?
- No, Captain.

526
01:00:13,127 --> 01:00:14,765
Where do you think
Geronimo will head?

527
01:00:15,447 --> 01:00:18,803
- The boarder?
- He'll make a raid for guns and bullets.

528
01:00:20,647 --> 01:00:21,716
Captain.

529
01:00:22,527 --> 01:00:25,997
"To Captain Burnett
from General Crook.

530
01:00:27,407 --> 01:00:31,241
- Due to Apache uprising, confine"...
- Confine?

531
01:00:31,407 --> 01:00:33,716
"...lndian Police to post".

532
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:35,766
You cannot leave the post.

533
01:00:35,847 --> 01:00:38,884
"Move all available troops out
by morning.

534
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:43,765
We'll join forces to pursue
and destroy Geronimo.

535
01:00:44,647 --> 01:00:46,239
Signed: General Crook".

536
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:48,925
I do not believe.

537
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:53,282
- The General has given his word.
- Taza, you must trust me.

538
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:54,920
They promised to trust me.

539
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:58,004
- I'm sorry, my orders...
- I did give up Oona for nothing.

540
01:01:00,087 --> 01:01:03,443
The peace has broken.
The White Eyes are to blame.

541
01:01:09,407 --> 01:01:10,726
Giddyup, go!

542
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:12,956
Go!

543
01:01:25,367 --> 01:01:27,403
This is Grey Eagle, this is Geronimo.

544
01:01:27,687 --> 01:01:30,884
Pleasure. Tiswin Charlie.
This is my partner, Jim Blake.

545
01:01:31,127 --> 01:01:32,401
Where are the guns?

546
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:34,361
Right this way.

547
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:48,677
- Looks old to me.
- You expected brand new Winchesters?

548
01:01:49,087 --> 01:01:50,805
You are lucky to be given these.

549
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:55,239
Well. Let's see the color of your money.
We got to be on our way.

550
01:01:55,567 --> 01:01:57,239
- 300 dollars.
- Three?

551
01:01:57,967 --> 01:01:59,685
My guns are 60 dollars a piece.

552
01:02:00,047 --> 01:02:03,562
- He said you had 600.
- We gave you enough for these old guns.

553
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:06,156
No, Geronimo.
You are behind the times.

554
01:02:06,487 --> 01:02:09,399
If you want the full load,
you're gonna pay 300 more.

555
01:02:11,287 --> 01:02:14,597
- We have no more.
- Then you get just 6 rifles.

556
01:02:15,047 --> 01:02:19,120
When you inherit more of these greenbacks,
come and see us.

557
01:02:21,967 --> 01:02:24,197
Hold it, Jim.
Let's see...

558
01:02:24,247 --> 01:02:27,125
Four, five...
And almost new Henry.

559
01:02:27,407 --> 01:02:28,965
Box of ammunition, Jim.

560
01:02:31,727 --> 01:02:33,718
Nice knowing you, gentleman.

561
01:02:42,647 --> 01:02:43,636
Giddyup!

562
01:02:53,447 --> 01:02:55,915
Left wheel, forward!

563
01:03:37,087 --> 01:03:38,122
Good morning.

564
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:40,643
- What's troubling you?
- My conscious.

565
01:03:41,047 --> 01:03:44,119
You disobey my orders
about confining the Police?

566
01:03:44,247 --> 01:03:46,158
I did not, sir.
They're confined as ordered.

567
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:48,284
I take it you believe
the order was unwise.

568
01:03:48,487 --> 01:03:51,206
I hope I'm wrong.
We've lost Taza as a friend.

569
01:03:51,487 --> 01:03:54,285
Enough about Taza.
We're concerned with Geronimo.

570
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:55,556
Yes, sir.

571
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,603
- Recognize them, Hegan?
- Yes, sir.

572
01:05:03,287 --> 01:05:04,959
Jim Blake and Tiswin Charlie.

573
01:05:05,487 --> 01:05:08,445
Some critters who sold guns
to anybody who could pay.

574
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:11,041
I presume Geronimo
has now those weapons.

575
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:14,563
- Captain, bury these two bodies.
- Yes, sir.

576
01:05:14,767 --> 01:05:15,916
Bolin, Casey.

577
01:05:19,767 --> 01:05:21,883
One of my men, sir.
From San Carlos.

578
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:25,278
The Reservation Police broke out.

579
01:05:25,327 --> 01:05:27,522
- They did?
- They left the uniforms behind.

580
01:05:27,567 --> 01:05:30,877
We'll have to contend
with Geronimo and Taza.

581
01:05:31,447 --> 01:05:34,519
Captain, you admit
you were wrong about Taza.

582
01:05:34,607 --> 01:05:38,156
No, sir. I believe the general
was wrong to issue the order.

583
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,842
Captain, I'm afraid
your army days are numbered.

584
01:05:40,887 --> 01:05:41,922
General.

585
01:05:42,807 --> 01:05:44,957
We better get started.
We're losing time.

586
01:05:45,287 --> 01:05:47,039
Forward. Ho!

587
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:54,078
Column, right!

588
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:22,046
Cavalry horses.

589
01:06:49,887 --> 01:06:52,082
- What did you find?
- Fresh markings.

590
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:55,444
- Geronimo must have taken the pass.
- Let's lose no time.

591
01:06:55,487 --> 01:06:56,556
- General.
- Captain.

592
01:06:56,607 --> 01:06:58,723
I suggest you take a detour to the south.

593
01:06:58,767 --> 01:07:02,043
- It'd be safer for us.
- And it'd be too for Geronimo.

594
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:05,962
- He'd have cross the border by then.
- Yes, sir.

595
01:07:06,207 --> 01:07:07,401
Sergeant Hamma.

596
01:07:10,047 --> 01:07:12,242
- Yes, sir.
- See if that pass is clear.

597
01:07:12,607 --> 01:07:14,006
Reily! Douglas!

598
01:07:58,807 --> 01:08:01,321
Inform the General the pass is clear.

599
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:02,436
Yes, Sergeant.

600
01:08:08,487 --> 01:08:11,445
It's gonna be a fast ride
if we're gonna catch Geronimo.

601
01:08:20,047 --> 01:08:21,924
Forward! Ho!

602
01:11:12,927 --> 01:11:14,963
- Lieutenant
- Yes, Captain.

603
01:11:15,047 --> 01:11:18,119
- Tell them to make every bullet count.
- We haven't got a chance.

604
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:23,877
Before they wipe us all out,
we'll take some devils with us.

605
01:11:48,727 --> 01:11:49,716
Taza!

606
01:11:57,127 --> 01:11:59,800
He comes not as a soldier coat,
but as an Apache.

607
01:12:04,327 --> 01:12:05,316
Taza!

608
01:12:07,647 --> 01:12:10,115
Pray your friend
gives you a Christian burial.

609
01:12:14,647 --> 01:12:17,798
- General, Taza is with us.
- He comes as a traitor.

610
01:12:40,487 --> 01:12:42,717
Tell your people
to stop fighting or you die.

611
01:12:44,847 --> 01:12:45,836
Tell them!

612
01:12:54,647 --> 01:12:56,365
Hold your fire!

613
01:12:57,407 --> 01:12:59,523
General!
Hold your fire!

614
01:12:59,847 --> 01:13:01,121
Hold your fire!

615
01:13:01,247 --> 01:13:02,600
Hold your fire!

616
01:13:03,047 --> 01:13:04,196
Apaches!

617
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,366
Throw down your weapons!

618
01:13:09,807 --> 01:13:11,081
Throw down your weapons.

619
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:20,243
Naiche, throw down your gun!

620
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:23,241
Never!
If you want me, take me dead!

621
01:13:40,767 --> 01:13:44,043
- Captain, I apologize.
- I think all apologies belong to Taza.

622
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:54,239
Taza, I admit with shame
that I doubted you.

623
01:13:54,727 --> 01:13:56,638
I assure I never will again.

624
01:13:58,927 --> 01:14:00,565
I'll remove all troops
to Fort Apache.

625
01:14:00,967 --> 01:14:03,640
What do you intend doing with Geronimo?

626
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:07,443
I would like the White Eyes
take him to another reservation.

627
01:14:08,207 --> 01:14:10,084
With him gone,
the Apache nation can leave in peace.

628
01:14:10,407 --> 01:14:13,365
I'll make the request to Washington.
They'll agree.

629
01:14:40,887 --> 01:14:42,286
You built it strong.

630
01:14:42,767 --> 01:14:44,758
I'll be finished before night.

631
01:14:50,767 --> 01:14:52,883
My brother's shadow
has walked away.

632
01:14:54,247 --> 01:14:56,363
Oona will be Taza's wife.

633
