[Sighs]

6
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:45,946
Who's responsible for that?

7
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:48,514
Hard to say.

Brotherhood hunt in packs.

9
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:54,987
But I am confident the novelty

10
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,835
of beating up the new guy will wear off.

11
00:00:56,836 --> 00:01:00,735
Malachi Strand tried to make
a deal with me last week.

12
00:01:00,736 --> 00:01:03,669
He said he could make the beatings stop

13
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,002
if I agreed to vouch for
him at his parole hearing.

14
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:08,569
Under no circumstances are
you to make that deal, Walt.

15
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,569
Hopefully, I won't have to.

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,936
Cady's scheduled your bail
hearing for Friday at 5:00.

17
00:01:13,937 --> 00:01:15,735
Now, if all goes well,

18
00:01:15,736 --> 00:01:17,635
you'll be out by the weekend.

19
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:19,735
Meantime, if you need anything...

20
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:21,669
Actually, there is something.

21
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,936
It might seem small, but
it is important to me.

22
00:01:24,937 --> 00:01:27,769
I need you to take my place as a Judge

23
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,969
for a competition on the reservation.

24
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,502
The event is very sacred.

25
00:01:32,503 --> 00:01:35,569
It is the Miss Cheyenne Nation Pageant.

26
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,468
A beauty pageant.

27
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:41,302
It is not your typical beauty pageant.

28
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:44,970

All right, that is contestant number 6.

Walt.

42
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:34,201
Vic, I'm a little busy.

43
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:36,555
Yeah, well, sorry to interrupt
the swimsuit competition,

44
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,068
but we got a body.

45
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:40,101

00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,277
Walt: Sorry. Took me a while to smooth
things over with the other Judges.

49
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:55,550
So, what's the story?

50
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,856
High-school kid and his
girlfriend called the body in.

51
00:02:57,857 --> 00:02:59,333
I tried to ask them some questions,

52
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:01,045
but, like typical teenagers,
they wouldn't tell me

53
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:02,503
what the hell they were doing out here.

54
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:05,471
I got a pretty good idea
what they were doing out here.

55
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:10,270
This property's been abandoned for decades.

56
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:13,337
Become a popular destination
for teenage couples.

57
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:15,770
- [Gloves snap]
- How romantic.

58
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:17,770
Victim's name is Ben Mallory.

59
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,337
He's 32 years old.

60
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:21,437
He took two stab wounds to the left torso.

61
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:24,537
The blood on his shirt and
the mattress are both dry,

62
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,969
so I'm assuming that he, uh,

63
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,170
got killed sometime last night.

64
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:37,836
Sorry, did you know him or something?

65
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:40,270
No.

66
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,680
No, stabbing's just a bad way to go.

67
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,203
Any signs of robbery?

68
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:48,370
No. His wallet and cash are still on him.

69
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,737
But I did find this.

70
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:52,737
[Pills rattle]

71
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:54,804
Prescription pills,

72
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:56,270
medical supplies,

73
00:03:56,271 --> 00:04:00,470
and a Durant Regional I.D. Badge.

74
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:03,903
It looks like Ben Mallory was a doctor.

75
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:06,831
Well, then, let's get Dr. Mallory
to the hospital for an autopsy.

76
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:08,613
You can talk to Ben's co-workers,

77
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:10,747
find out what a doctor
was doing way out here.

78
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:13,680
I hope the suit fits. I
had to buy it off the rack.

79
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:16,481
Nothing in your closet
was really formal enough.

80
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:18,979
Whatever you think will
help our chances, counselor.

81
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,997
Okay [Sighs]

82
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:24,612
Decent.

83
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:29,521
It's a little loose,

84
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:31,321
but it looks good.

85
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:32,421
How do you feel?

86
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:34,321
Like an Indian Al Capone.

[Exhales sharply]

88
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:36,521
I even have the scars.

89
00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:38,421
Well, don't worry about that,

90
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:39,889
because I came prepared.

91
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:44,419
Now, remember, this is not a trial.

92
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,420
It's a bail hearing.

93
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:47,316
There is a Judge but no jury.

94
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:49,370
And we don't have to
prove that you're innocent.

95
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:51,314
We just have to show that
you're not a flight risk.

96
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:52,715
And how do we do that?

97
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:55,514
By showing that you're a model citizen.

98
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:59,048
Which you are... you've
never even been arrested.

99
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,981
Actually...

100
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:05,247
Ben Mallory's associates said
that he'd only lived in Durant

101
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:06,514
for three months.

102
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,148
Before that, he spent two years

103
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:10,448
with doctors without
borders in West Africa.

104
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,715
Did Ben have a wife or kids?

105
00:05:12,716 --> 00:05:15,115
No. But his parents live in South Dakota.

106
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:17,281
I just spoke to his mom on the phone.

107
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:20,281
She said they'd get down
here as soon as they could.

108
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:22,836
Ben's secretary said that he got a call

109
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,551
around 6:00 last night.

110
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:25,443
A few minutes after that,

111
00:05:25,444 --> 00:05:27,107
he left the office with his medical bag...

112
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:28,165
didn't say where he was going.

113
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,100
She just assumed that he
was making a house call

114
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:31,366
on his way home.

115
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:33,900
That barn's a pretty odd
place to make a house call.

116
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,199
Yeah, but he's new in town.

117
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,000
He had no idea where he was going.

118
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,266
It sounds like this caller

119
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:39,933
was trying to lure him out there.

120
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:43,266
Did Ben have any recent problems
with colleagues or patients?

121
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:46,199
All the nurses said that there'd
never been an incident at the hospital.

122
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,454
But one of them did say that he also
worked out at the reservation clinic, so...

123
00:05:49,455 --> 00:05:52,733
Uh, I can head out there if you want.

124
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:54,933
You sure you're up for that?

125
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:56,399
[Chuckles]

126
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,199
Driving and talking?

127
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,700
I think I can handle it.

128
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,433
[Door closes]

129
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,132
Hey, there.

130
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:28,065
[Laughs] Hey.

131
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:30,432
[Chuckling]

132
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:32,232
Oh. [Grunts]

133
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,866
It's good to see you!

134
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,486
I guess you remember me.

135
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:37,407
Yeah, it's good to see
you up on your feet again.

136
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:39,119
You know, don't rush it, though, boss.

137
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,866
You got to rest up as much as you can.

138
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,432
[Chuckles] Rest will have to wait.

139
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:46,933
Does a Dr. Ben Mallory work here?

140
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:48,332
Yeah.

141
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,165
What can you tell me about him?

142
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,699
[Sighs] Not much.

143
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,666
Ben's a volunteer with
Indian Health Services.

144
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,366
Lot of those guys come through here.

145
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:57,733
Cocky white dudes sent to
rescue us with their medicine.

146
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:59,833
[Chuckles] But Ben's not too bad.

147
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,000
And the ladies, they
certainly don't mind him.

148
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:03,366
[Laughs]

149
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:06,366
Looks like someone murdered him last night.

150
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:09,099
Seriously?

151
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,466
Did he have problems with anyone?

152
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:15,733
Uh, one guy got into it with Ben last week.

153
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:18,432
They were both yelling
at each other pretty loud.

154
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:20,165
Can you tell me who it is?

155
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,000
Uh, no, not offhand,

156
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:23,800
but I can check the logbook.

157
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:37,032
<i>[Indistinct yelling echoing]</i>

158
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:38,806
Do you know what the
patient was yelling about?

159
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:40,469
No, I wasn't in the room.

160
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,501
But you were in the room
when I was brought in.

161
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:44,102
Yep.

162
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:46,935
First time I ever saved
anybody's life before.

163
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:48,568
It was kind of wild.

164
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,568
[Shudders]

165
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,568
Did I say anything weird?

166
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:56,634
Naw, by the time I jumped in,
you were already out of it.

167
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:59,302
Anyone else come in around that time?

168
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:01,601
Someone with a gunshot wound?

169
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:02,902
Like who?

170
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:10,601
You mean David?

You know him?

Oh, yeah.

173
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:15,223
He comes in all the time to donate blood.

174
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:17,290
When was the last time you saw him?

175
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,524
Mm, 'bout a month ago, I guess.

00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:22,956
[Sighs]

177
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:25,023
You see him again...

178
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:26,789
Call me right away.

179
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,490
Yeah, sure thing.

180
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:30,956
Uh, hey, don't you want
the name of the patient

181
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:32,856
that was yelling at Dr. Mallory?

182
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:34,558
[Chuckles]

183
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,357
[Sighs]

184
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:41,624
So, don't mention the fact that
you arrested Henry last year

185
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,370
- during that fracking protest.
- You sure?

186
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:44,804
I thought I'd lead with it.

187
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:46,772
Cady: [Chuckles]

188
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:53,204
Please don't try and be funny on the stand.

189
00:09:01,271 --> 00:09:03,270
Are you wearing make-up?

190
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:05,537
A little.

191
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:07,838
Bailiff: Court will come to order!

192
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,328
The Honorable Joseph Mayhew presiding.

193
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:11,794
All rise.

194
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:13,995
Judge: All right, everyone, settle in.

195
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:16,242
All right.

196
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:19,137
In the matter of the state
vs. Henry Standing Bear,

197
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:21,204
the defense is seeking bail?

198
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:23,304
Yes, we are, your honor.

199
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:26,838
I see that this is a murder charge,

200
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,304
and if convicted, your client
could be facing the death penalty.

201
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:34,304
My tentative judgment
is to deny bail outright.

202
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:36,838
Knowing this, do you still wish a hearing?

203
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,471
Yes! Yes, your honor.

204
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:40,838
My client has been a business
owner for over 20 years,

205
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:42,780
and... and this shows that...

206
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:44,294
I'll give you the weekend to decide

207
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:47,553
if you want to waste the court's time.

208
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:06,277
[Glass thuds]

209
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:11,476
That's enough, miss.

210
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,476
[Scoffs]

211
00:10:13,477 --> 00:10:17,009
I'm sorry, were we not in
the same courtroom today?

212
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,209
You heard what the Judge
said. He's made up his mind.

213
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,400
Henry's not getting bail.

214
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,867
I heard the Judge say you had
two days to figure something out.

215
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:26,100
So order some food and get to work.

216
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:28,830
You're not staying to eat?

217
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:32,364
I can't. Branch found
a suspect in our murder.

218
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,765
So I gotta go talk to him.

219
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:41,164
[Chuckles lightly]

220
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:45,331
[Sighs]

221
00:10:52,964 --> 00:10:55,197
Dale: Every time an
Indian raises his voice,

222
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:57,664
it's just a matter of time
before the cavalry shows up.

223
00:10:57,665 --> 00:11:00,097
Mr. Grey Wolf, why were
you yelling at Dr. Mallory?

224
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:01,497
Because he's a pervert.

225
00:11:01,498 --> 00:11:04,963
Did Dr. Mallory touch you or something?

226
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,464
No. My daughter.

227
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,197
She went to see him a couple of weeks ago.

228
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:10,331
She was sick. It looked like the flu.

229
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:11,698
But instead of taking her temperature,

230
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:14,264
this doctor took off her pants
and gave her a pelvic exam.

231
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:17,064
Did Dr. Mallory tell you why he did that?

232
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:18,997
Oh, he said he was just being thorough,

233
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:21,289
but he abused his medical authority
to look up my daughter's skirt.

234
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,958
So, yeah, I raised my voice.

235
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,632
Are you here to press charges against me?

236
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:27,387
Not yet. We would like
to talk to your daughter.

237
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:30,020
If she was molested, a
report should be filed.

238
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:31,807
She's at a friend's house tonight.

239
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:32,929
And frankly, there's no need

240
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,628
for you to drag out this ordeal.

241
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,596
The situation has been dealt with.

242
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:41,196
Vic: "The situation has been dealt with"?

243
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:43,662
Is that a nice way of
saying he murdered the guy?

244
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:45,196
Check Dr. Mallory's background

245
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:47,867
for reports of sexual abuse by patients.

246
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:50,268
In the meantime, we need
to talk to Dale's daughter.

247
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:51,676
Get her side of the story.

248
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,934
I'll make some calls, see
if I can track her down.

249
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:56,134
No need. I know where
she's gonna be tomorrow.

250
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:57,384
How so?

251
00:11:57,385 --> 00:12:00,134
I recognized her from the pictures inside.

252
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:03,001
She's a contestant in the
Miss Cheyenne Nation Pageant.

253
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:06,134
I was sort of surprised to
see you in the courtroom.

254
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:08,886
Back in school, I never
pegged you as a litigator.

255
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:11,501
So, how'd I do? What'd you think?

256
00:12:11,502 --> 00:12:14,401
I think that was your first bail hearing.

257
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:15,568
- [Chuckles]
- [Chuckles]

258
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,534
I'm not really a trial lawyer,

259
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,235
but there's a lot riding
on this case for me.

260
00:12:21,702 --> 00:12:24,668
You've done a lot of these
bail hearings, though, right?

261
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:27,090
So, aside from the client's record,

262
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:29,790
what else could I use as proof
to show that he won't run?

263
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,723
Is this why you called
me? To pick my brain?

264
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:35,563
You never minded tutoring me in law school.

265
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:37,196
Right...

266
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:39,329
But I had other intentions.

267
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,962
So, how about [Chuckling]
I buy you dinner tonight

268
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,396
and you give me your expertise?

269
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:48,229
Save your flirting for the Judge.

270
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,496
What questions you got?

271
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:51,996
Okay, are there any laws
that I should reference

272
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:52,725
in the bail hearing?

273
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:54,263
Or is there any way that I could, like...?

274
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:55,386
Cady...

275
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:56,937
Bail hearings are about people.

276
00:12:56,938 --> 00:12:58,871
If you want the Judge to grant bail,

277
00:12:58,872 --> 00:12:59,951
you need to prove to him

278
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:01,538
that your client is an honorable person.

279
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:03,404
Right.

280
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:04,604
Bring out his family...

281
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:05,704
preferably daughters.

282
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:07,504
The Judge has three girls.

283
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:10,171
Henry doesn't have any family.

284
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:11,704
That's bad.

285
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:13,337
So you gotta spin some bullshit

286
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:15,538
about how Henry's got
ties to the community.

287
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:16,761
He does.

288
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:17,962
There's a whole group of people

289
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,704
on the reservation that depend on him.

290
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:21,538
I could bring them all in to testify.

291
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,805
[Chuckling] Whoa.

292
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:26,271
Judge Mayhew hates a long hearing.

293
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,204
Find one good witness
and put them on the stand.

294
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:32,571
But I can't guarantee even that'll help.

295
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:34,838
Is there anything that you
can guarantee will help?

296
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,839
Yeah. Prove Henry didn't do it.

297
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:43,905
That was the hospital.

298
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,704
The call that lured Ben Mallory to the barn

299
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:48,171
came through the switchboard.

300
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:50,137
So the call is untraceable?

301
00:13:50,138 --> 00:13:51,770
Right.

302
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:53,949
There's no way to tell
if it's Dale Grey Wolf

303
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,450
or someone else entirely.

304
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:57,183
You know, I've been thinking,

305
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:59,883
maybe Dr. Mallory wasn't
at the barn on business.

306
00:13:59,884 --> 00:14:01,400
Back in high school,

307
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:02,916
the only reason anybody went up there

308
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:04,916
was to hook up without being caught.

309
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:07,315
So instead of making a house call,

310
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:08,780
he was making a booty call?

311
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,602
The guy at the Res Clinic said
he was popular with the ladies.

312
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:13,006
Maybe Ben was meeting one of them

313
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:16,073
up there to... "Play doctor."

314
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,006
Walt: I'm sorry to bother you.

315
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:28,073
Are you, by any chance,
Ben Mallory's mother?

316
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:30,572
Stepmother. I'm Dr. Sylvia Mallory.

317
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:33,873
And this is Ben's father, Dr. Oren Mallory.

318
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:37,306
I'm Sheriff Longmire. I
think you're here to see me.

319
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:39,040
Well, we were just about to head inside...

320
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,473
I can't.

321
00:14:40,474 --> 00:14:43,473
I know how hard this must be.

322
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:45,724
Facing the loss of a child

323
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:47,715
is about the worst thing
a parent can go through.

324
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:51,550
I just can't go through this again.

325
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:59,349
My oldest son, Andrew,
was murdered in Detroit.

326
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,182
They ever figure out who did it?

327
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:04,049
The police have pretty
much given up at this point.

328
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,749
As far as they're concerned,
Andrew's just another one

329
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,116
of Detroit's unsolved murders.

330
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,216
That was a year ago.

331
00:15:11,217 --> 00:15:13,749
And now Ben.

332
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,413
Did Ben have any enemies?

333
00:15:18,414 --> 00:15:21,113
Ah, no. He made friends everywhere.

334
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:23,047
He always volunteered for the places

335
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,613
that needed the most help.

336
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:26,246
He wanted to be just like you.

337
00:15:26,247 --> 00:15:28,147
Oh, he was a better man than I.

338
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:31,147
Now, I spent my fair share of time

339
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:34,579
working for Reservations and free Clinics.

340
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,147
But I did it to pay off
my medical-school bills.

341
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:40,080
Not Ben.

342
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:42,080
Ben was different.

343
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:44,913
He was selfless.

344
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:46,613
Ben could afford to be selfless.

345
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:47,880
He had you to support him.

346
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,813
Yeah, well...

347
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:52,080
[Groans]

348
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:54,814
You know, I keep thinking...

349
00:15:56,981 --> 00:15:59,447
...what did I do to deserve this?

350
00:16:00,914 --> 00:16:02,813
I know this is difficult,

351
00:16:02,814 --> 00:16:05,680
but any information you have may help.

352
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:08,179
Yeah, well, please, no offense,

353
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,813
but...

354
00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:13,646
I'm finding it hard to
see the point to all this.

355
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:17,179
When Andrew was killed, I
spent hours with the police,

356
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,212
and nothing came of it.

357
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,846
I know what that's like,
more than you think.

358
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:27,279
I'm sorry I can't do
anything about Andrew's case,

359
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,713
but I can do something about Ben's.

360
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:33,846
Now, I promise...

361
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:35,279
I promise...

362
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,847
things are gonna be
different this time around.

363
00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:44,225
Walt: Vic, put in a call

364
00:16:44,226 --> 00:16:46,128
to the Detroit Police Department.

365
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:47,382
Ask them for a copy

366
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,482
of Andrew Mallory's murder file.

367
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:51,182
Detroit?

368
00:16:51,183 --> 00:16:54,583
Since when did we start
investigating murders in other cities?

369
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:57,221
I'm just taking a look
for Oren Mallory's sake.

370
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:57,949
Okay.

371
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,482
In the meantime,

372
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:02,049
I got some information on Ben Mallory.

373
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,848
There are no allegations of sexual abuse,

374
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,416
no malpractice suits.

375
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,649
<i>The guy was a Saint.</i>

376
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,249
Dale Grey Wolf, on the other hand,

377
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,974
has two priors for assault,

378
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:12,226
and he's obviously got a temper.

379
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:14,239
So, depending on what
happened in that exam room,

380
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,874
he totally could have snapped.

381
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,074
We'll know more after
we talk to his daughter.

382
00:17:19,075 --> 00:17:20,507
"Contestant Grey Wolf,

383
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:23,306
what are your thoughts on world peace?"

384
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:24,940
"Oh, and, by the way,

385
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:28,141
do you think your father
could be a murderer?"

386
00:17:28,142 --> 00:17:30,306
[Tribal chanting]

387
00:17:30,307 --> 00:17:32,875
[Indistinct conversations]

388
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:38,974
[Scraping]

389
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,340
Neena Wapasha.

390
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:43,107
Is this your first time judging, Sheriff?

391
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:46,607
Yeah. I'm guessing you've
done quite a few of these.

392
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,173
About 15 between here
and my home in Oklahoma.

393
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:50,540
Don't be nervous.

394
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,473
It's just like talking
to your own daughter.

395
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:54,340
You mean they're gonna talk back?

396
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:57,107
[Both chuckle]

397
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:59,074
Contestant number two...

398
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:00,340
Lilly Stillwater.

399
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:02,107
- Hi, Sheriff.
- Hello, May.

400
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:04,173
Hello, Sheriff.

401
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:07,240
[Clears throat]

402
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:09,807
Contestant number one,

403
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:11,807
Micheala Grey Wolf.

404
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:13,007
Any relation?

405
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,440
My daughter.

406
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:17,774
Oh, she's cute.

407
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:21,473
Isn't this supposed to
be the talent competition?

408
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,407
Where are the batons?

409
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:26,840
Your idea of beauty pageants is a joke.

410
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:28,473
Bouquets and bikinis.

411
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:32,206
The Miss Cheyenne Nation Pageant
is a proud cultural honor.

412
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:35,206
These girls must prove
their knowledge and skill

413
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:36,573
at carving the animal.

414
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,007
The Judges ask them difficult questions

415
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:40,206
while they work

416
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:42,373
to see if they stay calm under pressure.

417
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:44,308
I imagine that's hard for some people.

418
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:55,407
Miss Grey Wolf.

419
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:58,240
What are the best spots to shoot a deer?

420
00:18:58,241 --> 00:19:01,824
A hunter should always aim
for the lung and the kidney.

421
00:19:01,825 --> 00:19:05,240
A direct shot to either will kill the
animal quickly so they won't suffer.

422
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:07,206
Where did you learn your butchering skills?

423
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:08,573
From my father.

424
00:19:08,574 --> 00:19:11,340
These knives have been handed down

425
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:14,342
through my family for generations.

426
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,774
Are you sick?

427
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:23,340
I know you recently
went to see Dr. Mallory.

428
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:25,273
What did he have to say about it?

429
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:28,074
He said it wasn't contagious.

430
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:32,340
Thank you. Think we have all we need.

431
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:34,275
- Good job, Micheala.
- Thank you.

432
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,340
So, what'd you think?

433
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:41,874
I think she's pregnant.

434
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:49,007
Walt: Whoever stabbed Dr.
Mallory knew what they were doing.

435
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:50,640
Direct hits to the lung and kidney

436
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:52,440
would have killed him almost instantly.

437
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,041
And from what I learned today,

438
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:56,840
Micheala and her father are
both experts with a knife.

439
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:58,705
All this because Ben
gave Micheala a pap smear?

440
00:19:58,706 --> 00:19:59,556
Seems extreme.

441
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:01,189
Well, there's a little more to it.

442
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,951
It looks like Micheala may be pregnant.

443
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:07,278
Wow. Okay.

444
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:09,102
Well, from what Branch found out,

445
00:20:09,103 --> 00:20:10,983
Ben was pretty popular
with his female patients.

446
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:12,681
Maybe he and Micheala
were having an affair.

447
00:20:12,682 --> 00:20:14,753
That could explain what he was
doing at the barn that night.

448
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:17,219
Dr. Mallory meets Micheala
there for a little privacy.

449
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,134
Dale Grey Wolf finds out
about it and ambushes him.

450
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,101
That, or maybe Ben tried to end the affair.

451
00:20:22,102 --> 00:20:24,034
Micheala got pissed, decides to kill him.

452
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:25,649
Walt: Before we go too far with theories,

453
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,198
we need to confirm she's pregnant.

454
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:30,529
We need to get a look at
Micheala's medical files.

455
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,730
- Cady: Thank you.
- Thank you.

456
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,830
Just gonna take this.

457
00:20:37,998 --> 00:20:41,838
Okay, so, um, this isn't quite right,

458
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,629
but it's a great start, so I'm
gonna go get you a-a clean sheet,

459
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,029
and you can take another crack at it, okay?

460
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,764
Okay.

461
00:20:52,397 --> 00:20:54,795
- We are so screwed.
- Cady?

462
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,196
It's gonna be okay.

463
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:58,029
Have you even read these affidavits?

464
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,995
Most of the people are afraid
to sign their own names,

465
00:20:59,996 --> 00:21:04,596
and of the ones who did, the best one
says Henry was pretty good at darts.

466
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,029
You are not wrong. These are terrible.

467
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,196
But it is early.

468
00:21:09,197 --> 00:21:10,762
We'll give them some pointers.

469
00:21:10,763 --> 00:21:11,929
Okay?

470
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:15,663
Good. Now, just relax.

471
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:16,862
It's gonna be okay.

472
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:19,129
[Clears throat]

473
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,862
Excuse me.

474
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,762
[Chuckling] Hi.

475
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:27,358
I'm so sorry.

476
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:30,518
I completely forgot we were having drinks.

477
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:32,051
I didn't think I was working tonight,

478
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:34,022
but Cameron said we've
got to log in some...

479
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:36,202
some hours if we're gonna
give Henry a fighting chance.

480
00:21:36,203 --> 00:21:37,569
Who's Cameron?

481
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,935
Uh, Cam... Cameron Maddox?

482
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:43,469
He's, um, he's an old
friend from law school.

483
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,702
He's got a lot of trial experience.

484
00:21:46,703 --> 00:21:48,635
So I've brought him on
as my shadow counsel,

485
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:50,702
which is kind of like
an unofficial adviser.

486
00:21:50,703 --> 00:21:53,802
He said I... I need one
good witness for Henry,

487
00:21:53,803 --> 00:21:55,835
so I threw this little affidavit party

488
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:58,635
to see who the best spokesperson might be.

489
00:21:58,636 --> 00:22:00,637
Mm.

490
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,035
May: You're gonna need more food than that.

491
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,768
[Laughs]

492
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:12,768
Hello, May.

493
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:14,136
Where did everybody come from?

494
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:16,503
They made an announcement
after the pageant finished

495
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:17,735
for the day.

496
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,419
Lilly sang the Cheyenne departing song.

497
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,393
You should have heard her.

498
00:22:20,394 --> 00:22:22,293
You trying to sway my vote?

499
00:22:22,294 --> 00:22:25,059
[Laughs] I don't care which way you vote.

500
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,795
I just wish you could see how far
Lilly's come these past two years.

501
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:30,969
It wouldn't have been
possible without you and Henry.

502
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,934
Oh [Chuckles] I don't know
how much I had to do with it.

503
00:22:34,935 --> 00:22:35,833
She's a good kid.

504
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:38,201
Yeah. She is.

505
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:41,402
Okay.

506
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:45,767
- Nice to see you.
- [Screams]

507
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:47,501
You were looking for anything you could use

508
00:22:47,502 --> 00:22:49,100
to get my daughter disqualified!

509
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,401
And I guess now I know why!

510
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,867
What the hell are you talking about?!

511
00:22:52,868 --> 00:22:54,867
[Grunting]

512
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:58,134
You told the Judges Micheala was pregnant!

513
00:22:58,135 --> 00:23:00,767
Is she?! Well, is she?!

514
00:23:00,768 --> 00:23:02,000
You can answer me here...

515
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:03,601
Or at the station!

516
00:23:03,602 --> 00:23:06,134
[Groaning]

517
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,869
[People murmuring]

518
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:12,402
[Groans]

519
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:27,318
Walt: When I mentioned to the Judges

520
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:29,151
that Micheala might be pregnant,

521
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:31,585
I had no idea it was grounds for dismissal.

522
00:23:31,586 --> 00:23:34,884
Thanks to you, the other Judges
forced Micheala to take a test.

523
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:36,418
When it came back positive,

524
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,884
they threw her out of the
competition on the spot.

525
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:41,585
I tried to keep it a secret
until after the pageant.

526
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:46,518
That title meant everything to Micheala.

527
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,951
And to you.

528
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:49,318
So, who's the father?

529
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,852
What business is that of yours?

530
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:52,884
Vic: Because we think Dr.
Mallory might be the father.

531
00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:55,213
And when you found out that a white
doctor knocked up your daughter,

532
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:56,221
you decided to kill him.

533
00:23:56,222 --> 00:23:57,754
What?

534
00:23:57,755 --> 00:23:59,721
You never told me he was dead.

535
00:23:59,722 --> 00:24:01,288
I didn't kill him.

536
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:04,392
It was Micheala's boyfriend
who got her pregnant.

537
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:06,726
That doctor had nothing to do with it.

538
00:24:06,727 --> 00:24:08,926
So why were you really
yelling at him at the clinic?

539
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:11,726
Because he offered Micheala an abortion.

540
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:14,726
Dr. Mallory said it was "an option."

541
00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:16,084
That's what he called it.

542
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:17,851
But it really was just the latest ploy

543
00:24:17,852 --> 00:24:20,085
white doctors are using to wipe us out.

544
00:24:20,713 --> 00:24:22,078
They've done it before.

545
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,178
In the 1880s they'd wrap newborns

546
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:25,912
in disease-covered blankets.

547
00:24:25,913 --> 00:24:27,201
Up until the 1980s,

548
00:24:27,202 --> 00:24:30,946
they were sterilizing Indian
women without their permission.

549
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:34,946
A woman would go to the
clinic for an appendectomy

550
00:24:34,947 --> 00:24:37,479
and leave with a hysterectomy.

551
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,479
Now, every time an Indian
girl turns up pregnant,

552
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,946
they tell her to abort.

553
00:24:45,947 --> 00:24:49,546
They say it saves their future...

554
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:54,179
But all it really does is
destroy our tribe's legacy.

555
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:57,846
[Footsteps approach]

556
00:24:57,847 --> 00:24:59,047
Branch: Walt.

557
00:25:04,746 --> 00:25:09,283
The Detroit P.D. just sent
over Andrew Mallory's case file.

558
00:25:09,284 --> 00:25:13,916
Turns out he was stabbed in the
exact same places as his brother, Ben.

559
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:16,250
No money was missing off his body.

560
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:19,283
You think the same
person killed both of 'em?

561
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,083
Dale clearly had reasons to kill Ben,

562
00:25:22,084 --> 00:25:25,515
but there's no cause for
him to go after Andrew.

563
00:25:25,516 --> 00:25:28,381
Dale isn't the only expert when
it comes to knives and anatomy.

564
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:29,914
So, what, you're thinking Micheala?

565
00:25:29,915 --> 00:25:31,880
She didn't have a motive
to kill Andrew either.

566
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:35,880
I was actually thinking
about a different woman.

567
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:38,114
Sylvia Mallory. She's a doctor...

568
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:41,580
Knows where a knife can do the most damage.

569
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,680
Plus, Oren Mallory sounds
like he's got money.

570
00:25:43,681 --> 00:25:47,780
With his sons out of the
way, she'd get everything.

571
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:49,514
Wouldn't be the first wicked stepmother

572
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:50,948
to try and kill her stepchildren.

573
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,243
[Sighs] All right.

574
00:25:53,382 --> 00:25:55,680
Check into the Mallorys' finances.

575
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,381
See if there was money worth killing for.

576
00:25:58,382 --> 00:26:00,747
Also, check on Sylvia's whereabouts

577
00:26:00,748 --> 00:26:02,747
around the time of Ben's death.

578
00:26:02,748 --> 00:26:05,114
What about Dale Grey Wolf?

579
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:09,514
He hit an officer. Leave him in the cell.

580
00:26:09,515 --> 00:26:11,880
I see you had him ditch the suit and tie.

581
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:14,001
He's a Native American.

582
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:16,713
Dressing him up like a banker
just hides who he really is.

583
00:26:16,714 --> 00:26:18,214
Shall we?

584
00:26:18,215 --> 00:26:19,880
I'm afraid you're on your own.

585
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:21,514
Believe it or not,

586
00:26:21,515 --> 00:26:23,613
I do have cases of my
own that need attention.

587
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:25,880
Of course. Yeah.

588
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:28,947
Look, I am sure you'll be fine on your own.

589
00:26:28,948 --> 00:26:30,514
[Sighs]

590
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:32,580
Besides, the Judge gave
his tentative ruling.

591
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:33,514
So, don't forget...

592
00:26:33,515 --> 00:26:34,713
you're already doomed.

593
00:26:34,714 --> 00:26:36,713
Thank you for that vote of confidence.

594
00:26:36,714 --> 00:26:37,780
Anytime.

595
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:40,448
What's in the box?

596
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:43,381
Ferg had it sent over from Rawlins.

597
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:46,281
Files on men I put away over the years.

598
00:26:46,282 --> 00:26:48,548
One of them might have committed the crime

599
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:49,914
that Henry's on trial for...

600
00:26:49,915 --> 00:26:51,760
To get back at me.

601
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:53,726
You think your wife's
murder and Henry's arrest

602
00:26:53,727 --> 00:26:55,593
are all retaliation?

603
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:59,650
Whoever did this wanted to
make sure I suffered every day.

604
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,451
You got anyone in particular in mind?

605
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:03,750
Plenty.

606
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:05,817
You find out anything about the Mallorys?

607
00:27:05,818 --> 00:27:09,636
Sylvia's office said she was
at a conference in Billings

608
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:10,817
when Ben was killed.

609
00:27:10,818 --> 00:27:12,951
But I haven't been able to
find anyone from the event

610
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:14,418
that can verify that.

611
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:16,784
Checked into Oren Mallory's finances.

612
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:17,951
He's loaded.

613
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:21,203
Oren built up and sold medical
practices all over the country...

614
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:23,951
Virginia, Oklahoma, South Dakota.

615
00:27:23,952 --> 00:27:25,884
His net worth is about 22 mil.

616
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:28,984
And with both his sons gone,

617
00:27:28,985 --> 00:27:30,951
Sylvia gets everything.

618
00:27:30,952 --> 00:27:33,784
Okay.

619
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:37,018
Okay, uh...

620
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:39,679
Maybe, instead of looking

621
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,661
at who benefits from the boys' death,

622
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:45,100
we should think about who suffers.

623
00:27:47,313 --> 00:27:50,612
Ben Mallory's body ready to be released?

624
00:27:50,613 --> 00:27:52,345
So, in addition to being

625
00:27:52,346 --> 00:27:54,779
the arresting officer on this case,

626
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,479
you've known the defendant a long time.

627
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,946
Based on your experience,

628
00:27:58,947 --> 00:28:02,046
do you think he'd be a
good candidate for bail?

629
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:05,146
You mean will he stay put?

630
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:07,612
He's a Cheyenne. We're originally nomads.

631
00:28:07,613 --> 00:28:10,989
Look, Henry Standing Bear
has no wife and no kids.

632
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,245
Now, he can give you his word he won't run,

633
00:28:13,246 --> 00:28:16,379
but frankly, I don't think
his word can be trusted.

634
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,346
Why do you say that?

635
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:20,273
I watched him sign an intent
to waive his extradition.

636
00:28:20,274 --> 00:28:22,273
Then later, it was ripped up.

637
00:28:22,274 --> 00:28:25,090
Which shows total disrespect
for the laws of this court.

638
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:26,072
Objection!

639
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:28,438
This is not a trial, counselor.

640
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:31,173
Sorry. Point of clarification, your honor.

641
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:35,618
This extradition waiver...
you said it was ripped up.

642
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:37,819
Did you actually see my
client destroy the waiver?

643
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,828
No.

644
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:41,254
Was it in fact another
party who ripped it up?

645
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:41,928
Yes...

646
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,562
then it appears my client has
no disrespect for the court.

647
00:28:44,563 --> 00:28:45,962
It is the other party that does.

648
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:47,661
I guess.

649
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:50,688
It was his best friend that tore it up,

650
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:51,969
which is all the more reason

651
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,063
to deny Henry Standing Bear bail.

652
00:28:54,612 --> 00:28:55,864
He obviously has

653
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:57,330
some questionable associates.

654
00:28:57,331 --> 00:29:01,031
And if you can't trust
the company a man keeps,

655
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:04,065
you can't trust the man himself.

656
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:12,664
<i>Judge: Court recognizes the defense.</i>

657
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:14,764
<i>Cady: Your honor...</i>

658
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:17,078
I have 125 affidavits here,

659
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:20,136
each one of them a testament
to my client's strong character

660
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:21,887
and the community's reliance on him.

661
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:24,800
I was up for seven hours
last night reading them.

662
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:26,417
To spare your honor this task,

663
00:29:26,418 --> 00:29:29,285
I have chosen one person
who can speak for them all.

664
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:35,758
<i>Miss Stillwater, would
you share with the court</i>

665
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,526
a little of your history with my client?

666
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:41,064
[Sighs] About two years ago,

667
00:29:41,065 --> 00:29:42,964
my daughter Lilly ran away from home.

668
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:45,364
She was 15.

669
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:49,264
I started hearing rumors
that she had fallen into...

670
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:51,164
Prostitution.

671
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:53,531
I tried looking for her everywhere,

672
00:29:53,532 --> 00:29:55,698
but it was like she'd disappeared.

673
00:29:55,699 --> 00:29:58,164
The tribal police wouldn't help me.

674
00:29:58,165 --> 00:29:59,731
No one would help me...

675
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:01,930
Until I called Henry.

676
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:07,097
Henry, along with his best friend,

677
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:09,465
they brought my Lilly home.

678
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,508
After that, he came every
single week to check in.

679
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,841
He got her started in school again,

680
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:18,040
and he paid for a good therapist.

681
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:21,241
Because of him, Lilly is now thriving.

682
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:23,674
She's even competing to represent our tribe

683
00:30:23,675 --> 00:30:25,941
in the Miss Cheyenne Nation Pageant.

684
00:30:25,942 --> 00:30:27,407
[Chuckles lightly]

685
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:31,248
And Henry did all of this
even though he wasn't family?

686
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:34,914
We Cheyenne have a different
definition of family.

687
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:38,348
Family is not a matter of
biology, but of loyalty.

688
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:40,981
And if that's the way you look at it,

689
00:30:40,982 --> 00:30:43,614
Henry is the closest family we have.

690
00:30:43,615 --> 00:30:48,547
In your opinion, do you think Henry
will flee if given the opportunity?

691
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:51,814
No. His name is Standing Bear.

692
00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:54,790
Would you mind clarifying?

693
00:30:55,982 --> 00:31:00,513
Many people think when they see
a bear standing in the forest,

694
00:31:00,514 --> 00:31:02,314
it means to run.

695
00:31:02,315 --> 00:31:05,910
But the bear is just standing guard,

696
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:10,612
looking to protect those he
loves from whatever may come.

697
00:31:11,978 --> 00:31:14,644
[Voice breaking] Henry is a standing bear.

698
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:17,177
And a standing bear will never run,

699
00:31:17,178 --> 00:31:20,244
no matter what.

700
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:23,712
Thank you, Miss Stillwater.

701
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:28,877
Oren: Did you find out who did it?

702
00:31:28,878 --> 00:31:31,344
Walt: Not yet.

703
00:31:31,345 --> 00:31:33,144
First I...

704
00:31:33,145 --> 00:31:37,977
I thought Ben's murder might
involve one of his patients.

705
00:31:37,978 --> 00:31:42,010
Then I looked at your first
son Andrew's case file,

706
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:46,311
and it turns out Andrew's murder
is almost identical to Ben's.

707
00:31:46,312 --> 00:31:49,910
Are you saying they were
killed by the same person?

708
00:31:49,911 --> 00:31:52,344
Well, I admit it's hard to believe.

709
00:31:52,345 --> 00:31:56,445
After all, there's nothing really
linking the two boys together.

710
00:31:56,745 --> 00:31:59,177
They live in different places,

711
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:01,010
have different jobs.

712
00:32:01,011 --> 00:32:03,910
In fact, the only things
they have in common

713
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:06,744
are the same father...

714
00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:08,910
And the same stepmother.

715
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:12,110
If you're implying that Sylvia had
something to do with this, you're wrong.

716
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:15,877
We were together on vacation
when Andrew was killed.

717
00:32:15,878 --> 00:32:17,477
And as for me, I...

718
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:20,144
I could never hurt my sons.

719
00:32:20,145 --> 00:32:22,843
I know that.

720
00:32:22,844 --> 00:32:24,877
And I think the killer knew

721
00:32:24,878 --> 00:32:28,411
that taking them away
would make you suffer.

722
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:30,577
Well, I can't think of anyone

723
00:32:30,578 --> 00:32:32,377
who would want to hurt me like this.

724
00:32:32,378 --> 00:32:35,943
I have dedicated my life to helping people.

725
00:32:35,944 --> 00:32:37,411
Yes.

726
00:32:37,412 --> 00:32:41,943
You said you worked on the Reservations.

727
00:32:41,944 --> 00:32:44,210
I know that in the '70s,

728
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:47,444
about the same time you were practicing,

729
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:50,810
doctors on the Res were
sterilizing Native women

730
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:52,344
without their consent,

731
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,810
sometimes without even their knowledge.

732
00:32:54,811 --> 00:32:56,977
Did you ever take part in that?

733
00:32:56,978 --> 00:32:59,444
<i>This again.</i>

734
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:01,444
Listen.

735
00:33:01,445 --> 00:33:05,511
No charges were ever filed against me.

736
00:33:05,512 --> 00:33:09,977
What I did was within
my rights as a doctor.

737
00:33:09,978 --> 00:33:14,977
Most of the women I cared for
couldn't care for themselves.

738
00:33:14,978 --> 00:33:18,144
I remember once a 32-year-old
mother came into the clinic

739
00:33:18,145 --> 00:33:20,477
with her 15-year-old daughter.

740
00:33:20,478 --> 00:33:24,244
Both pregnant, both alcoholic.

741
00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:28,350
It was a constant cycle of poverty

742
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:29,880
and substance abuse.

743
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:33,609
Sterilization was the only
way of breaking that cycle.

744
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,022
Now, some saw it as radical.

745
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:40,545
I saw it help women escape
the horrors of the Reservation.

746
00:33:44,434 --> 00:33:49,478
Despite what you may
think, I know I was right.

747
00:33:53,412 --> 00:33:55,044
[Sighs]

748
00:33:59,911 --> 00:34:03,211
You never know if you're right.

749
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:08,644
I told you before I could solve this case.

750
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:11,110
But in order for me to do that,

751
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:14,311
I need you to waive
doctor/patient confidentiality

752
00:34:14,312 --> 00:34:17,577
and open up your medical records.

753
00:34:17,578 --> 00:34:21,336
Your son's murder did involve a patient,

754
00:34:21,337 --> 00:34:24,091
and I think it was one of yours.

755
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:41,622
Before this hearing began,

756
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:43,933
I told you what my tentative ruling was.

757
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,567
In murder cases,

758
00:34:45,568 --> 00:34:48,834
I find it hard to justify
the granting of bail.

759
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:53,033
But, in light of the testimony given,

760
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:55,933
I've decided to make an exception.

761
00:34:55,934 --> 00:34:58,868
Bail is set at $1 million.

762
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:02,234
[Spectators murmur]

763
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:03,846
Cady: I spoke to the bail bondsmen.

764
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:06,479
He said they'd cover 90% of the bail.

765
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,193
But we still need to come up with $100,000

766
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:10,947
that we don't have.

767
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:13,798
Well, there's some money in my
retirement fund. It's not a lot,

768
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:15,962
- but it'll at least get us started.
- [Knock on door]

769
00:35:15,963 --> 00:35:19,595
The important thing is
that bail was granted.

770
00:35:19,596 --> 00:35:21,062
You did good, punk.

771
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:22,196
Thanks, dad.

772
00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:24,263
Just get back here. We'll figure it out.

773
00:35:24,264 --> 00:35:25,163
Okay.

774
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,096
<i>- Okay, bye.
- Bye.</i>

775
00:35:27,097 --> 00:35:29,529
So, I've been going
through the list of patients

776
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,996
that Oren Mallory gave us.

777
00:35:30,997 --> 00:35:32,629
So far, it doesn't look
like any of the women

778
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,483
have a connection to Dale Grey Wolf.

779
00:35:34,484 --> 00:35:36,517
It's possible it's a distant relative

780
00:35:36,518 --> 00:35:37,984
with a different last name.

781
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:40,185
Could be an Aunt or an Uncle or...

782
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:45,984
Never mind.

783
00:35:45,985 --> 00:35:47,801

784
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:49,431

00:35:50,584 --> 00:35:54,074
- Walt.

Not much to celebrate.
Henry's still in jail.

790
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:08,548
And even with dad's retirement

791
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:10,433
and the collection jar we passed around,

792
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,333
we're still short about 50 grand.

00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:25,631
I am writing you a check for $100,000.

796
00:36:25,632 --> 00:36:26,900
What?

797
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:28,146
No. No.

798
00:36:28,147 --> 00:36:31,399
Branch, no, I'm not letting
you spend your money on this.

799
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,133
I will find some way to raise the cash.

800

You can't bake sale your
way out of this, Cady.

801

I don't know what to say.

802

Henry will really appreciate it.

803

Besides, we both know it's not my money.

I'm sure your dad will be
thrilled when he finds out.

I was a young woman with
so much to be proud of.
