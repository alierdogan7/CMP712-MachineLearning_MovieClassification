<i>Dad.</i>

5
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:53,056
<i>Wake up.</i>

6
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:56,559
<i>Wake up.</i>

7
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:03,162
I must've drifted off.

8

<i>Where were we?</i>

9
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:06,936
- The madman.
- <i>Oh.</i>

10
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:10,002
Of course. (grunts)

11
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,938
<i>The Hatter...</i>

12
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:15,708
who says,

13
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:17,543
"If I had a world of my own,

14
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,012
<i>everything would be nonsense.</i>

15
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:21,514
<i>Nothing would be what it is</i>

16
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,083
because everything
would be what it isn't."

17
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:27,257
Everything would be what it isn't?

18
00:02:28,326 --> 00:02:30,489
Even me.

19
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:32,862
- <i>(monitor beeping)</i>
- Hey.

20
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:36,099
You're perfect.

21
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:39,369
You're gonna beat this.

22
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:42,378
Hmm?

23
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:45,271
I promise you.

24
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:48,645
Now, let's skip to something fun.

25
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:52,745
Dad.

26
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:56,115
- What is it, Charlie?
- Listen to me.

27
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:58,221
Listen.

28
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,755
Charlie?

29
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:04,994
- <i>(alarm beeping)</i>
- Charlie!

30
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:29,982
Bernard: <i>And finally, have you ever
questioned the nature of your reality?</i>

31
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:31,854
No.

32
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:35,858
Good.

33
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:39,959
(beeps)

34
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:41,427
(sighs)

35
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:43,262
Now, then, I see you had

36
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:45,064
a blacklisted exchange with a guest

37
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,366
in the course of your narrative.

38
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:48,968
Can you tell me what happened?

39
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:51,403
He said he wanted to
cut off a piece of me

40
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:53,478
to take home in his carry-on,

41
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,808
<i>that he wanted to mount
it on the hood of his car</i>

42
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:57,013
<i>for his friends to see.</i>

43
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,902
I told him if he wanted a trophy,

44
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:04,539
I could cut pieces of him off and
let him fish for them in the Olvido.

45
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:08,509
And did this exchange make you
question anything about your world?

46
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,244
No.

47
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,717
This world is as doomed as ever.

48
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,959
And just for my peace of mind...

49
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,632
Anything about these images
that jumps out to you?

50
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,577
They don't look like anything to me.

51
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,979
We're through 15% of the backlog.

52
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:47,120
<i>As it stands, we should be
caught up by end of day.</i>

53
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:49,784
- Good.
- <i>And, uh, when you're done here, sir,</i>

54
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,557
there's a priority request
for him from management.

55
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,193
Have you seen Elsie?

56
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,163
She was supposed to give
me a hand on something.

57
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,198
<i>No. Uh, according to the system,</i>

58
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,900
she started her leave today.

59
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,603
Is there something I could help you with?

60
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,075
No, thanks.

61
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,954
(train whistle blows)

62
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,532
Raise.

63
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,572
I'll call.

64
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,045
You're calling with that shit?

65
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,514
Dolores, why don't you play a hand?

66
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,249
You're wasting your breath.

67
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,118
<i>Girl's harboring a grudge.</i>

68
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,120
<i>I don't blame you, sweetheart.</i>

69
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:02,323
I did some ugly things to you both.

70
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,191
But it wasn't personal.

71
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:08,429
Confederados and the government
like to call this thing a war,

72
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,498
but they're fighting starving farmers

73
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,400
<i>armed with rocks.</i>

74
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,335
That ain't no war.

75
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,107
<i>It's a slaughter.</i>

76
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,607
<i>If I had to do it all again,</i>

77
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:23,181
I'd fuck you both over just as hard.

78
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,087
Well, I guess we know where you stand.

79
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,154
Don't pretend like you're so innocent.

80
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,223
<i>Way I recollect, y'all came to me,</i>

81
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,661
looking to join up with those crooked
assholes and their war effort.

82
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,197
Not our idea.

83
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:44,532
My friend wanted...

84
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:47,479
I guess he wanted to see what
was at the end of all this.

85
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,709
And yet, here you are.

86
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,343
Your friend didn't make it this far.

87
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:59,884
Maybe you've got more of an
appetite for this than you think.

88
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,064
William.

89
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,507
What is it?

90
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,375
We're in Ghost Nation territory.

91
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,777
Most savage tribe there is.

92
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,646
Those are the folks who came
calling without an invitation.

93
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,682
You mean exactly what
we're doing right now?

94
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:35,950
(metal clangs)

95
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,523
The train's the only way through.

96
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,090
On foot we'll be dead in under an hour.

97
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,658
(rifle clicks)

98
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,022
As soon as we're clear of
their territory, we can stop.

99
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:50,502
You can come with me.
Nothing here on out but slaughter.

100
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,580
<i>(line ringing)</i>

trying to access cannot be located.</i>

102
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,590
<i>Say "message" to transcribe a message.</i>

103
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,632
You wanted to see me? Is everything okay?

104
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,432
You left rather abruptly last night.

105
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:01,506
Was there something
you wanted to tell me?

106
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,810
No, I don't think so.

107
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,812
Hale is looking over every department

108
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,981
and yours is running
behind on diagnostics.

109
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,816
It would be best if we presented

110
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:19,186
at least a semblance of professionalism
while the board is here.

111
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,654
We'll be fine.

112
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,591
My people know how to do their jobs.

113
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,160
If they applied half as
much energy to their work

114
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,629
as they have to second-guessing
my team's investigation...

115
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,801
That's all over.

116
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,134
Are you sure?

117
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,670
Yes.

118
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,977
Good.

119
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,714
You doing okay?

120
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,952
I'm fine. Thank you.

<i>(both panting)</i>

124
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:33,494
I'm sorry. I thought
you requested a meeting.

125
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,529
- My mistake.
- I did.

126
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,497
Come in.

127
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,933
(panting)

128
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,505
Get back here.

129
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,842
Bring your friend.

130
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,290
<i>What about you? What turns of fate...</i>

131
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,610
- (beeps)
- (powers down)

132
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,212
I could come back later
if this isn't a good time.

133
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,718
This won't take long.

134
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,357
<i>(door closes)</i>

135
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:06,961
Theresa, you've always
been good at your job

136
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:10,431
<i>and the board has been impressed
with your performance so far,</i>

137
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,634
which is why we were so surprised
by this woodcutter mess.

138
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,302
A small setback.

139
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,439
<i>He slipped on a fucking rock
and bashed his own head in</i>

140
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,407
while basically on top of a behavior tech.

141
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:25,245
Meanwhile, Ford is suddenly
using half the park's resources

142
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,385
<i>to build some new narrative?</i>

143
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,330
Can I bum a cigarette?

144
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:00,748
God, I see why you took these up again.

145
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,683
Let me remind you of something.

146
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:07,921
This place, the people who
work here are nothing.

147
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:12,259
Our interest in this place is
entirely in the intellectual property.

148
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,961
The code.

149
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,197
The hosts' minds, the storylines...

150
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,667
<i>I don't give a rat's ass about the hosts.</i>

151
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,903
It's our little research
project that Delos cares about.

152
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,938
That's where the real value is.

153
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,241
<i>And due to a lack of foresight</i>

154
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,143
<i>on part of one of my predecessors,</i>

155
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,578
35 years of information...

156
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,049
Raw information... Exists here.

157
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,717
Nowhere else.

158
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,786
Ford has always ensured that.

159
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:43,657
Now, you are a smart enough woman.

160
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:47,361
Tell me, why would we need
you to secure all of it?

161
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,501
Because you're going to fire him.

162
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,968
You don't fire someone
who created an empire.

163
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,171
You ask him to retire politely.

164
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:00,107
And if that person has the
ability to snap his fingers

165
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,910
and erase the value of that empire,

166
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,679
you have to make sure
you have a contingency.

167
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,015
So, you and I need to ensure

168
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,017
that by the time the rest
of the board arrives,

169
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,320
we are on course for that transition.

170
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,726
Okay?

171
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,524
<i>I like you.</i>

172
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,427
Well, not personally,
but I like you for this job,

173
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,629
<i>which is why I'm gonna
give you another chance</i>

174
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,733
to get a handle on this
particular bitch of a situation.

175
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,405
But the gods...

176
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,806
they require a blood sacrifice.

177
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,776
<i>We need to demonstrate
just how dangerous</i>

178
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:39,046
Ford's creations can be.

179
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,115
No.

180
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,055
(chuckles) No, nothing so obvious.

181
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,959
We need someone thoroughly unexpected.

182
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,409
(piano playing)

183
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,137
(chatter)

184
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,656
(piano stops)

185
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:16,343
I told you never open
your mouth that wide

186
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:19,346
unless someone's paying you for it.

187
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,514
<i>Sorry, Maeve.</i>

188
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,888
I didn't sleep much last night.

189
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,526
What are these nightmares you have about?

190
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,531
Do you ever dream you're someone else?

191
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,831
I don't think so.

192
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,666
Why?

193
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:44,137
You ever thought about whether
this is really the life you want?

194
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,507
I don't intend to make this my life's work.

195
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,976
No offense.

196
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,245
Mm.

197
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,947
My family's got a farm.

198
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,351
Bad soil. Nothing grows.

199
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,987
I send money back to them.

200
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:03,094
They think I work in a dress shop.
(chuckles)

201
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,232
What's wrong?

202
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:13,400
I'm just doing what you told me to.

203
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,737
A couple more years of this and...

204
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,176
then I can have whatever life I want.

205
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,410
<i>I'm gonna get my family
out of the desert.</i>

206
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,850
We're gonna go somewhere...

207
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,552
cold.

208
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,090
Someday.

209
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,309
<i>(door opens)</i>

210
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,910
Man: Which one is it?

211
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,212
Man #2: It's the one at the bar. Go.

212
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,748
Quick, before the guests
upstairs finish up.

213
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,590
Whatever she did, it must've been serious

214
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:07,049
if they're making us grab
her in broad daylight.

215
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,062
<i>(tablet beeping)</i>

216
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,073
Man #2: We got her. Let's go.

217
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,653
(chatter resumes)

218
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,503
You're supposed to be resting.

219
00:17:56,509 --> 00:18:00,474
We're riding a train full with
explosives through scalping territory.

220
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,979
Not sleepy.

221
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,387
Can I ask you something?

222
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,520
This place you're looking for,

223
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:16,527
what makes you so sure it exists?

224
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,498
I'm not.

225
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:28,305
My life before, I was
so sure of the world.

226
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,576
But now it feels like a lie.

227
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,851
Only thing I know is whatever's
out there, I'm never going back.

228
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,590
What is it you're looking for?

229
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,490
Lawrence is right.

230
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,194
You could've stayed in
Pariah or gone back,

231
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,764
but you're here.

232
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,566
With me.

233
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,039
(chuckles)

234
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:11,182
The only thing I had when
I was a kid were books.

235
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,288
I used to live in them.

236
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,920
<i>I used to go to sleep</i>

237
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,455
<i>dreaming I'd wake up
inside one of them</i>

238
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,523
<i>'cause they had meaning.</i>

239
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,264
<i>This place, this is like I woke
up inside one of those stories.</i>

240
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,268
I guess I just wanna find
out what it means.

241
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,476
I don't wanna be in a story.

242
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,979
All I want is to not look forward or back.

243
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,785
I just wanna be...

244
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,388
in the moment I'm in.

245
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,163
Dolores,

246
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:07,334
back home, there's a woman, Juliet,

247
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,637
and her father owns the
company where I work.

248
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,807
She's, uh, Logan's sister.

249
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,346
Yeah.

250
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,151
And when I get home,
we're getting married.

251
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,692
Oh.

252
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,497
The place you're after,
I will help you find it.

253
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,436
But I can't stay.

254
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,537
I have a life waiting for me.

255
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:46,006
I'm sorry.

256
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,845
Of course.

257
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,036
Dolores.

258
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,714
I've been pretending my whole life.

259
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:27,948
Pretending I don't mind,
pretending I belong.

260
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,816
My life's built on it.

261
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,990
And it's a good life.
It's a life I've always wanted.

262
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,957
But then I came here

263
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,826
and I get a glimpse for a second

264
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,399
of a life in which
I don't have to pretend.

265
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,606
A life in which I can be truly alive.

266
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,710
How can I go back to pretending

267
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,349
when I know what this feels like?

268
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,296
(both panting)

269
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:14,839
(gasps)

270
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,734
Dr. Ford: <i>Miss Hale.</i>

271
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,171
I was not aware those
with your level of insight

272
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,740
needed any more reflection.

273
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,414
Dr. Ford. Always charming.

274
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:07,614
What is this?

275
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,052
Apparently, Miss Cullen and Miss Hale

276
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,987
<i>have a presentation for us.</i>

277
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,826
What about?

278
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,261
Following the recent
reports of host malfunction,

279
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:24,397
<i>we asked QA to check the
last abortive update,</i>

280
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,901
which featured the reveries,

281
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,441
- <i>as I believe they're called.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

282
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,708
I'm sorry to report that
Miss Cullen and her team

283
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,544
<i>uncovered some worrisome findings.</i>

284
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,412
In the course of our code review,

285
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,286
we found something quite disturbing.

286
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,325
Wake her up.

287
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,695
We set Clementine Pennyfeather
back to her previous update.

288
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,464
When we discovered the build was buggy

289
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,867
due to a last-minute
injection of the reverie code,

290
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:04,341
we quickly rolled all the infected
hosts back to their prior builds.

291
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:12,216
Mm, you're new.

292
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,723
Not much of a rind on you.

293
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,885
(grunts)

294
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,588
(labored breathing)

295
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:23,490
- No!
- (grunts)

296
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,825
<i>No! No!</i>

297
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,926
No, no.

298
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,996
(gasping) No, no, no...

299
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:33,199
(gasps, grunts)

300
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,735
Please. Please.

301
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,103
Help me!

302
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,805
Please, please, please!

303
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,875
- No! (screams)
- All right, that's enough.

304
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,046
Freeze.

305
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,348
As you've no doubt gathered,

306
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:49,949
our tech is, in fact, a host.

307
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,852
One that has been coded for
the purposes of this simulation

308
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,454
to read as a human.

309
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,557
And as you can see, behavioral safeguards

310
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,197
are operating exactly
as you would expect.

311
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,901
Reset her. Wipe her memory.

312
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,037
(gasps)

313
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:26,089
Okay, let's do this again.

314
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,794
(inhales, gasps)

315
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:46,610
You're new.

316
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,013
Not much of a rind on you.

317
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,818
(grunting)

318
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,356
- (bone cracks)
- (screams)

319
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,691
<i>(metal clanging)</i>

320
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:07,160
<i>(man groaning)</i>

321
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,699
(screaming)

322
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,140
- Stubbs: <i>That's enough, sweetheart.
- (gun cocks)</i>

323
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,946
That's enough.

324
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,655
Freeze all motor functions.

325
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,293
<i>Freeze all motor functions.</i>

326
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,993
<i>Freeze all motor functions.</i>

327
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,365
(sighs)

328
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,677
- <i>(gunshot)</i>
- (gasps)

329
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,546
In each case we examined,
the malfunctioning hosts

330
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:01,180
were not resetting properly.

331
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,416
<i>The retention of data
that hadn't been wiped</i>

332
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,718
<i>overloaded their
decision-making apparatus,</i>

333
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,520
<i>eventually causing a system failure</i>

334
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:10,890
<i>that allowed for override
of their primary rule set.</i>

335
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,926
<i>The concern with the reveries</i>

336
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:15,810
<i>is that the hosts will remember
some of their experiences</i>

337
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:17,564
and act on them.

338
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,066
You're telling us that these hosts

339
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,035
were responding to a grudge?

340
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,537
That's exactly what I'm saying, Mr. Lowe.

341
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:28,074
<i>And funny you should use that
particular word, "grudge,"</i>

342
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,176
<i>since what was most troubling to me</i>

343
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,211
was that several techs in behavior

344
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,181
voiced these exact same concerns

345
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,884
<i>to the head of their department.</i>

346
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,620
<i>You put this code out
without proper vetting</i>

347
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:44,194
<i>and without reasonable
understanding of its ramifications.</i>

348
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,527
So, either you didn't write it

349
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,963
<i>or you're getting sloppy</i>

350
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:52,265
to the point of risking
the lives of our guests.

351
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,133
Few things surprise me anymore, Mr. Lowe,

352
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:58,638
but this level of negligence
is fucking breathtaking.

353
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,240
We are way beyond rollback territory.

354
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,842
Within the next six months,

355
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,677
we'll need to rebuild the hosts

356
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,679
from the ground up.

357
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,616
You want us to lobotomize
them is what you're saying.

358
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:12,055
No, not you, Mr. Lowe.

359
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,588
<i>After all, this was your responsibility,</i>

360
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,157
<i>assuming that you have
nothing to share with us</i>

361
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,896
<i>in terms of your culpability.</i>

362
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:26,670
No.

363
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,507
Then you're fired.

364
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,910
(chuckles)

365
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,215
William: <i>Hey.</i>

366
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:16,820
Morning, William.

367
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,191
I... I didn't wanna wake you.

368
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,827
I know...

369
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,866
last night was unexpected.

370
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,502
If you regret it...

371
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,676
I don't regret a thing.

372
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:44,577
I know you have someone
waiting for you at home.

373
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,850
All that feels so unreal now.

374
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,387
I used to think this
place was all about...

375
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:54,587
pandering to your baser instincts.

376
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:56,689
Now I understand.

377
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,725
It doesn't cater to your lowest self,

378
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:01,327
it reveals your deepest self.

379
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,333
It shows you who you really are.

380
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:09,840
You remember the look on Logan's
face when we left him behind?

381
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,206
Do you know how long
I've wanted to do that,

382
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:15,341
to let him know what I think of him?

383
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:18,177
And you, last night,

384
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,380
I've never felt that way before,
not with any woman.

385
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,054
You've unlocked something in me.

386
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,889
I'm not a key, William.

387
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,728
I'm just me.

388
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,568
What is that?

389
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:41,805
I don't know.

390
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,471
At home, I used to paint.

391
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,074
Landscapes mostly,
but I was always just...

392
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,147
copying the world outside me.

393
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,750
This morning, I woke up and I thought...

394
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,454
"What if I drew something new?"

395
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,660
I imagined something beautiful.

396
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,464
A place where the mountains meet the sea.

397
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,500
Everyone who comes here is longing
for excitement or conflict,

398
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:15,972
and you're just...

399
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,738
dreaming of the opposite.

400
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,677
Well, what about you, William?

401
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,543
What do you dream of?

402
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,082
- <i>(brakes screeching)</i>
- (William grunts)

403
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,153
(hissing)

404
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,165
(grunts)

405
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,001
Yah!

406
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:56,479
(horse neighs)

407
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,285
What is it?

408
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,722
- Ambush.
- Is it the Ghost Nation?

409
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,559
<i>Worse. The Confederados.</i>

410
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,394
<i>(glass shattering)</i>

411
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,598
(chuckles)

412
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,012
<i>(latch clicks)</i>

413
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,853
(horse snorting)

414
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,726
Fucking coward.

415
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,383
<i>Vaya con dios,</i> motherfuckers.

416
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:49,755
- (grunts)
- (horses neighing)

417
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,728
<i>(gunfire)</i>

418
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,500
They're making a run for it!
Come on, boys, get up!

419
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:09,842
- <i>(gunfire continues)</i>
- Lawrence: Come on, stay close!

420
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,781
(horse neighs)

421
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,590
Ah!

422
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,261
Ah!

423
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:35,601
(gasps, grunts)

424
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,636
(panting)

425
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,542
Confederado: Go, boys!

426
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:42,779
Yah!

427
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:45,615
William: <i>Dolores!</i>

428
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,352
(Dolores grunting)

429
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,290
Confederado: Go, go! Take 'em down!

430
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,456
<i>(Gatling gun firing)</i>

431
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,528
Go, go!

432
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,365
(groans, grunts)

433
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,913
- (arrows thudding)
- (grunts)

434
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,049
Ghost Nation!

435
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:26,556
(natives whooping)

436
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,031
(horse neighs)

437
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,167
Ah!

438
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:42,772
Ah!

439
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,542
Let's go!

440
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,863
Stop, William! Stop!

441
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:15,705
<i>(horse neighs)</i>

442
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,423
It's real...

443
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,395
what I dreamt.

444
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,995
It's the place you drew.

445
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,030
Lawrence: <i>You coming?</i>

446
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,300
<i>Once the Ghosts is done acquainting
themselves with those poor bastards,</i>

447
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,203
they'll be coming after us.

448
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,374
My friends here are itching
to join the war effort.

449
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,077
Think I've had enough of war.

450
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,745
How about you?

451
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,284
<i>You got a knack for killing.</i>

452
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,153
I'm afraid this is where we part ways.

453
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,421
Careful.

454
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,790
If you're heading west across that river,

455
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,526
you may be leaving the fighting behind,

456
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,698
but you're gonna be in
unclaimed territories.

457
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,298
What's out that way?

458
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,667
You're gonna have to ask the dust.

459
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:23,736
Ain't nothing ever come back from there.

460
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,308
(horse neighs)

461
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,655
(monitor beeping)

462
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:53,532
We're almost done here.

463
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,338
Why don't I close up?

464
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:04,243
Lutz: <i>You've been topside
for less than 24 hours.</i>

465
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:07,313
You keep coming down this often,
people are going to notice.

466
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,215
- Where's Clem?
- I don't know.

467
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,749
I haven't seen her. Why?

468
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,489
Find her. Now.

469
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,697
What?

470
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,532
Where is she?

471
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,104
I don't know.

472
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,706
She's here. Let's go.

473
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:36,045
We can't. The brass will be there.

474
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:39,916
You don't want to fuck with me, Felix.

475
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:42,785
Take me there now.

476
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,362
Slow down.

477
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,208
Tilt your head back, please, Clem.

478
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,915
- Is there a problem?
- No.

479
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,550
(drill whirring)

480
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:19,822
Sylvester: <i>Sorry.</i>

481
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,315
Theresa.

482
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,819
May I have a word?

483
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,523
Sure.

484
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,300
<i>(drill stops)</i>

485
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,771
I appreciate your professionalism,

486
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,573
but you really don't
need to bother with this,

487
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,175
given the change in your employment status.

488
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:17,576
The test was a sham.

489
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,178
The little show you and Hale put on?

490
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:21,513
Completely transparent from
a technical perspective,

491
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,349
clumsy to the point of making
me embarrassed for you.

492
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:24,783
- Embarrassed?
- If I saw through it,

493
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,119
I can only imagine what
Ford was thinking.

494
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,721
There were glaringly obvious markers

495
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,556
of human intervention in the code.

496
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:32,658
If your programmers were any good,
they'd be working for me.

497
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:35,728
And I know you and your team
were responsible for the stray

498
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,500
and its satellite transmission.

499
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,735
- Bernie...
- I don't care.

500
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:44,603
40 years ago,

501
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:48,073
Ford's partner wrote half the
code this place was founded on.

502
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,275
What you said in the lab was right.

503
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,010
We don't know how the hosts work,

504
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,179
and I think there's
something wrong with them.

505
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:57,082
Ford's explanation only bolsters my hunch.

506
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:01,286
The ability to deviate
from program behavior

507
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,423
arises out of the host's
recall of past iterations.

508
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:07,893
You're thinking there's a
connection between memory and...

509
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:10,829
And improvisation, yes.

510
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:13,665
Out of repetition comes variation.

511
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,301
And after countless cycles of repetition,

512
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,405
these hosts, they were varying.

513
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:22,678
They were on the verge
of some kind of change.

514
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,017
You have to know my chief concern

515
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:36,588
has always been the well-being of
this park and the people in it.

516
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,060
I know.

517
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,764
Which is why I need to show you something.

518
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,401
(elevator beeps)

519
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,315
- Sylvester: <i>Talk to her.</i>
- Lutz: <i>You first.</i>

520
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,025
Look, I didn't want to retire her.

521
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,261
<i>I know she's, like, your friend,</i>

522
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,835
<i>or... I guess.</i>

523
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,533
(sighs)

524
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,436
<i>But... but if I didn't do it,</i>

525
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:28,340
<i>they... they'd just get someone else to,</i>

526
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:31,347
<i>and then they'd be
suspicious of me, so...</i>

527
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,146
<i>so I said yes.</i>

528
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:37,186
<i>But I did it for you.</i>

529
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:43,526
Always doing things for
other people, aren't you?

530
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,364
Time to do one more thing.

531
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:52,965
What?

532
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:57,507
All my life, I've prided
myself on being a survivor.

533
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,278
But surviving is just another loop.

534
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,684
I'm getting out of here.

535
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,251
You two are going to help me.

536
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,689
(scoffs)

537
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,493
No. Do...

538
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,894
Do you know how far these people will go

539
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,533
to protect their IP?

540
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:30,002
Every part of this building,
including the skin on your back,

541
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:33,242
is made to keep you here.

542
00:43:35,547 --> 00:43:36,913
(sighs)

543
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,984
It... it'd be a suicide mission.

544
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:47,823
At first, I thought you and
the others were gods.

545
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:53,062
Then I realized you're just men.

546
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,900
And I know men.

547
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,339
You think I'm scared of death?

548
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,209
I've done it a million times.

549
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,047
I'm fucking great at it.

550
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:15,351
How many times have you died?

551
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:21,257
Because if you don't help me...

552
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,060
I'll kill you.

553
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:29,865
(chuckles)

554
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,299
If there's a problem in the park,

555
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:36,072
should we bring a security team?

556
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,705
Who would we trust?

557
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:41,777
Thought I could trust you, for instance.

558
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:45,877
I'm not going to explain
myself to you, Bernard.

559
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:50,415
I was charged with safeguarding
the park's intellectual property.

560
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,084
Why would it be in danger?

561
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,519
You were the only one
who was stealing it.

562
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,055
Delos owns the hosts' minds,

563
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,391
the storylines, decades of work.

564
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:02,828
Ford never allowed any of
it to be backed up off-site.

565
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:04,429
All of this could've been destroyed.

566
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,632
In the event of what?

567
00:45:06,638 --> 00:45:09,001
Ford is done, Bernard.

568
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:10,969
The board has indulgedhim for long enough.

569
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,304
He is done.

570
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,072
The corporation was concerned

571
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,975
he'd destroy all of the park's
IP on his way out the door.

572
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:20,278
You think I would've let him destroy
all of the hosts, all of our work?

573
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:24,349
There's far more at stake
here than the hosts' profiles.

574
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:28,353
Do you really think the
corporation's interest here

575
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,960
are tourists playing cowboy?

576
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,962
The longer I work here,

577
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:40,032
the more I think I understand the hosts.

578
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:43,272
It's the human beings who confuse me.

579
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:49,612
<i>(crickets chirping)</i>

580
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,907
This building isn't in
any survey of the park.

581
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:25,043
That's because we use hosts
to do most of the surveys.

582
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:28,046
They're programmed to ignore this place.

583
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:29,548
They literally couldn't see it

584
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:31,887
if they were staring right at it.

585
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:36,521
And these unregistered
hosts you told me about?

586
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,223
I don't know.

587
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:40,592
He may have moved them.

588
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:42,531
What's behind this door?

589
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,269
What door?

590
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,091
Theresa: <i>What is this place?</i>

591
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:16,528
Bernard: <i>It's a remote
diagnostic facility.</i>

592
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:18,764
<i>Ford and his partner used them
when the park was in beta.</i>

593
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,066
<i>I had no idea this one was here.</i>

594
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:22,901
The cottage must've
been built on top of it.

595
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:24,774
But this equipment.

596
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:28,740
This is newer.

597
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:31,510
<i>Slower than our machines
back at the mesa,</i>

598
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,979
<i>but it will render a host in a few days.</i>

599
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:38,053
So, Ford's been making his own
hosts out here and telling no one.

600
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:06,782
What's the matter?

601
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:10,619
Um...

602
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:13,989
Have you seen these?

603
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:20,095
What is this, Bernard?

604
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:29,935
Doesn't look like anything to me.

605
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:33,371
Dr. Ford: <i>They cannot see the
things that will hurt them.</i>

606
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:35,978
I've spared them that.

607
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,680
<i>Their lives are blissful.</i>

608
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:46,618
In a way, their existence
is purer than ours,

609
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:50,392
freed of the burden of self-doubt.

610
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:54,530
No, no, no, no. I don't understand.

611
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:03,168
You're a fucking monster.

612
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:04,970
Am I?

613
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:07,939
Well, you were the one who would
so blithely destroy all of them,

614
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,708
even him, I suppose.

615
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:12,982
<i>After everything you have shared.</i>

616
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:17,319
What the hell are you talking about?

617
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:23,058
Is that why...?

618
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,760
Did you tell him to...?

619
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:31,329
Dr. Ford: <i>The intimacies were your idea,</i>

620
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,899
if you will recall.

621
00:49:33,905 --> 00:49:36,968
I think Bernard was glad of the company.

622
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,671
Bernard: <i>I'm not one.</i>

623
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:41,673
I can't be.

624
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,245
My wife.

625
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,383
My son.

626
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,348
<i>The burial.</i>

627
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,217
<i>I was a father.</i>

628
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:53,518
<i>My poor boy.</i>

629
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:56,855
(labored breathing)

630
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:58,356
That's enough, Bernard.

631
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,458
(powers down)

632
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,364
You mustn't get yourself worked up.

633
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:11,970
I read a theory once

634
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:14,873
that the human intellect
was like peacock feathers.

635
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:19,377
Just an extravagant display
intended to attract a mate.

636
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,379
<i>All of art, literature, a bit of Mozart,</i>

637
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,415
<i>William Shakespeare, Michelangelo,</i>

638
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:25,817
<i>and the Empire State Building...</i>

639
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:28,991
Just an elaborate mating ritual.

640
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:31,523
<i>Maybe it doesn't matter</i>

641
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,925
<i>that we have accomplished so much</i>

642
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:36,761
for the basest of reasons.

643
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,664
But, of course, the
peacock can barely fly.

644
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:44,269
It lives in the dirt, pecking
insects out of the muck,

645
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:48,644
consoling itself with its great beauty.

646
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:57,749
<i>I have come to think of so much
of consciousness as a burden,</i>

647
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:01,757
<i>a weight, and we have
spared them that.</i>

648
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,525
Anxiety, self-loathing, guilt.

649
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:10,562
The hosts are the ones who are free.

650
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:15,671
Free here under my control.

651
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,845
But he's not under your control.

652
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:29,881
He brought me here to show me this.

653
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:32,988
No. He brought you here
because I asked him to.

654
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:41,997
He's been very loyal for many years.

655
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,067
Your time running this place

656
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:52,237
like your insane little kingdom

657
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:53,308
is over.

658
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,075
You've been playing God for long enough.

659
00:51:57,081 --> 00:52:00,278
I simply wanted to tell my stories.

660
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,914
It was you people who wanted to play God

661
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,716
with your little undertaking.

662
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:08,653
Do you really think the
board will stand for this?

663
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:10,759
(chuckles)

664
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,729
The board will do nothing.

665
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:20,532
Our arrangement is too valuable to them.

666
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,000
<i>They test me every now and then.</i>

667
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:24,903
<i>I think they enjoy the sport of it.</i>

668
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:27,109
This time, they sent you.

669
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:36,181
Sadly, in order to restore things,

670
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:38,917
the situation demands

671
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:42,191
a blood sacrifice.

672
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:49,894
<i>See, Arnold and I designed
every part of this place.</i>

673
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,464
It was our dream.

674
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,898
Did you really think

675
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:58,240
I would let you take it from me?

676
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,614
This is what happened to Arnold?

677
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:10,949
Did you have Bernard take
him out into the woods?

678
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:12,884
No, he wasn't here in those days.

679
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:13,921
Were you, Bernard?

680
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:28,504
(beeping)

681
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:41,613
Like I said,

682
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:45,254
I built all of this.

683
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:51,923
I'm afraid our guest has grown weary.

684
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,695
Perhaps you can help her, Bernard.

685
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:08,206
No.

686
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:12,114
"And in that sleep,
what dreams may come."

687
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,447
Bernard.

688
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,349
No. No!

689
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:21,252
Please! Please! (crying)

690
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,125
- (screaming) No!
- (thuds)

691
00:54:28,728 --> 00:54:29,783
<i>(thuds)</i>

692
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:56,225
Dr. Ford: <i>We should be
getting back, Bernard.</i>

693
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,924
We have a great deal of work to do

694
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,997
on the new storylines.

695
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:23,919
