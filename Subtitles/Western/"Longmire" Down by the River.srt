00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:16,459
[knock on door]

3
00:01:25,726 --> 00:01:27,761
Henry, hi.

4
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:31,940
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:33,108
I was looking for Walt.

6
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:35,402
Did I miss something
while I was in prison?

7
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:39,489
No. [chuckles] Shut up.
I was just, like, dropping by.

8
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,024
With beer?

9
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:45,237
Um...

10
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:49,249
so, do you have any idea
where he is, or...

11
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,035
If I did, I would be there
rather than here.

12
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:54,879
[Henry] Hmm.

13
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,631
What?

14
00:01:56,632 --> 00:01:58,133
[Henry] Walt's saddle's on the fence.

15
00:01:58,134 --> 00:01:59,926
He normally puts it in the barn.

16
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,428
So?

17
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:03,297
So that is odd. Excuse me.

18
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:09,478
Hey, it's me... Vic.

19
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,481
Um, just, uh, seeing
what you're up to and...

20
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,984
and I was hoping that,
um, this isn't too weird,

21
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:18,611
but I was wondering
if you wanted to, um...

22
00:02:18,612 --> 00:02:19,695
[beep]

23
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:21,023
[Henry] Vic!

24
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,035
Henry?

25
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:28,037
What?

26
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:30,999
This was in his saddlebag.
It is empty.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,126
So he's out of tea.

28
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:35,545
This box used to hold Walt's wife's ashes.

29
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:37,964
The fact that the ashes
are gone is significant.

30
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:39,799
Why?

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,093
Walt once told me that he would
not scatter Martha's ashes

32
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:44,547
until he found the person who killed her.

33
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:48,258
Yeah, Miller Beck, which
we've known for months.

34
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:51,303
Henry.

35
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,193
Miller Beck stabbed her, but
David Ridges hired him to do it.

36
00:02:58,194 --> 00:02:59,735
And Ridges worked for somebody else.

37
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:01,154
Yeah, Jacob Nighthorse.

38
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:02,947
I think Walt is going after him right now.

39
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:04,991
[Vic] No, he can't be.
Nighthorse has immunity.

40
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:06,909
Walt can't arrest him.

41
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,738
He's not going to arrest him.

What the hell are you doing?!

58
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:31,620
- Helping!
- Get off of me!

59
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:32,442
No!

60
00:04:32,443 --> 00:04:33,978
This doesn't involve you!

61
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:44,372
Give me my rifle, Henry.

62
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:45,490
I cannot do that.

63
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,625
Suit yourself.
I'll just use this one.

64
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:52,079
I do not think this is
what Martha would want.

65
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:54,839
We'll never know.

66
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,174
If you fire that gun now,

67
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:58,627
you will kill everything that
you have ever stood for.

68
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,307
We have been given a second
chance, Walt, both of us.

69
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:07,101
I will not let you ruin it by
shooting Nighthorse out of the sky.

70
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:09,270
I was planning on waiting for him to land.

71
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:10,646
Let me have the gun!

72
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:14,059
Nighthorse is gonna pay for Martha.

73
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:18,196
He will!

74
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:21,366
If you go after him the right
way, through legal means.

75
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,110
It's too late for that.

76
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:28,497
If you shoot him now, I will
be implicated as an accomplice

77
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:31,000
and I will be thrown right back in jail.

78
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:34,246
You promised me that I
would never go back there.

79
00:05:43,472 --> 00:05:45,639
We will get him, Walt.

80
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,642
[breathing heavily]

81
00:05:48,643 --> 00:05:50,679
And he will pay for what he has done.

82
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:21,168
So...

83
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,380
What are you two doing here?

84
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:29,809
Customs.

85
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,053
Anything to declare?

86
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:35,056
Nope.

87
00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:38,567
[Henry] Okay, then.

88
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:40,812
Our work here is done.

[vehicle approaches]

91
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,396
- Hey, morning, Walt.
- Morning.

92
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:26,574
So, um, Henry was looking
for you yesterday.

93
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:27,783
Did he...

94
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:29,035
What happened to your face?

95
00:07:29,036 --> 00:07:30,286
Henry found me.

96
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:31,662
Where?

97
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:33,289
Out and about.

98
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,409
Don't worry. We worked it out.

99
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:37,668
What's in the box?

100
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:39,045
Casino research.

101
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:41,839
Stuff my wife pulled
together a while back.

102
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,716
I was hoping you'd get
the paperwork started

103
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:47,136
on getting wire taps on
Nighthorse's home and office.

104
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:50,515
I think the casino's got
connections to organized crime.

105
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:52,433
Why?

106
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:54,302
It's a casino.

107
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:06,280
Okay.

108
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:11,327
I don't know what Henry said, but I
didn't do anything stupid, so...

109
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:13,580
Henry didn't say anything.

110
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:15,582
Should he have?

111
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,250
Oh. Uh...

112
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:18,876
No.

113
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:20,336
Why are you here?

114
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:23,672
Well, I was worried about Branch, but
now I'm kind of worried about you.

115
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:25,883
What's up with Branch?

116
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:27,510
I haven't talked to him in a couple weeks.

117
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:30,721
We kind of left things on a bad note,
but last night out of the blue,

118
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:33,307
he started texting me,
like, a bunch of texts,

119
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:34,725
and they're kind of crazy.

120
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:36,511
Here, read them.

121
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,474
Don't worry. There's
nothing too personal.

122
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:42,559
[clears throat]

123
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:45,653
"You deserve better than me."

124
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:47,280
Well...

125
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:48,864
"I can't be with you right now."

126
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:50,991
Uh, "I need to be alone."

127
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:52,285
"I want you to forget about me.

128
00:08:52,286 --> 00:08:53,744
Don't remember me how I really am.

129
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:57,039
I'm a bad person. Remember
me how I should be"?

130
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,041
Sounds like he's been drinking.

131
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:01,043
Maybe. But...

132
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:03,003
I don't know.

133
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:05,714
- Did you call him?
- I texted him, but he won't respond.

134
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:07,550
I didn't say text him, I said call him,

135
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:10,337
as in two people talking
to each other directly.

136
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:13,757
Maybe I'll just go over and see him.

137
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:15,849
Wait. Wait.

138
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,435
The way Branch has been acting lately,

139
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:19,721
I'm not sure I want you
going over there alone.

140
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:21,981
[knock on door]

141
00:09:21,982 --> 00:09:23,399
Hello?

142
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,858
Branch?

143
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:25,985
[Walt] Talked to a neighbor.

144
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:29,905
Said he saw Branch's truck come and
go last night around dusk, so...

145
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:31,240
I know where he hides a key.

146
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:34,368
Cady, I don't have any right
to go into his house.

147
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:37,113
Okay, so stay here.

148
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:41,326
And if you're gonna arrest the concerned
ex-girlfriend, go right ahead.

149
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:57,183
[chuckles] Morning, Hank.

150
00:09:57,184 --> 00:10:00,102
Or, uh, closer to afternoon, actually.

151
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:01,521
Must be nice.

152
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:05,733
I just got back into town.
We, uh, had all the locks changed.

153
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:07,318
So, here's your new key.

154
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:09,445
Ah. Don't lose it.

155
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:10,697
[chuckles]

156
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:14,484
Now, shall we get ready to open, hmm?

157
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:18,572
Malachi, I am confused.

158
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,199
You haven't forgotten our deal, have you?

159
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,377
I give you some useless information

160
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:28,589
about my friend Darius'
whereabouts a couple years back,

161
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,592
and you sign the deed
of your bar over to me.

162
00:10:31,593 --> 00:10:33,427
That was if I go to jail.

163
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:35,054
No, it wasn't.

164
00:10:35,055 --> 00:10:39,885
You're not the first Indian to,
uh, make a bad business deal.

165
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:46,982
But... you did put years
of sweat into this bar.

166
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:48,609
You know how to run it.

167
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,607
You'll still be the face of the Red
Pony, and I'll look after the finances.

168
00:10:57,994 --> 00:11:00,788
Well, if Barlow comes in, please
have him call me immediately.

169
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:01,949
It's important.

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,168
Barlow hasn't come into the office yet.

171
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:08,045
His secretary doesn't know where he is.

172
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,714
But that could just be her, uh,

173
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:13,001
standing instructions on
what to say if I call, so...

174
00:11:14,302 --> 00:11:17,054
- You find anything?
- No.

175
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:18,514
I checked Branch's bedroom.

176
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:20,767
Luggage in the closet.

177
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:22,727
Toothbrush by the sink is dry.

178
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:24,853
I don't think he slept here.

179
00:11:24,854 --> 00:11:27,641
- Bed's been made.
- He always makes his bed.

180
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:32,270
From what I remember.

181
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:39,903
It's warm.

182
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:43,406
Dad.

183
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:52,047
"I'm sorry. This was not
supposed to happen.

184
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:55,676
But when I look in the mirror,
I don't know who I am anymore.

185
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:57,928
I've let everybody down
and I can't fix this.

186
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:00,097
I can't undo what I've done.

187
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:02,891
Don't try to find me.
I deserve to be alone.

188
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:04,935
It's the white warrior's fault.

189
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:07,271
He made me do this.

190
00:12:07,272 --> 00:12:09,565
Forgive me."

191
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:11,818
Oh, God.

192
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:13,944
What do you think he's done?

193
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:15,863
I'll find him.

194
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:17,865
I'll get Vic and Ferg to trace his phone.

195
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:20,660
We'll find him, okay?

196
00:12:20,661 --> 00:12:21,828
You go home.

197
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:24,413
You try and get ahold of Branch's dad.

198
00:12:24,414 --> 00:12:27,826
Try the house, try the office.

199
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,504
Maybe he'll respond to you.

200
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:32,963
Dad.

201
00:12:32,964 --> 00:12:34,666
What are you looking for?

202
00:12:35,843 --> 00:12:37,502
Nothing.

203
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,720
He's got a shotgun.

204
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:41,806
Which is exactly why you
want to put one of these on.

205
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:43,182
Never wore one. Not starting.

206
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:44,975
So, this is where the phone
company pinged his phone?

207
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:46,143
More or less.

208
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:47,978
Stop changing the subject. Put it on.

209
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:51,899
In my experience, bulletproof
vests beget bullets, so...

210
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,568
Yeah, and in my experience,
when a cop goes postal,

211
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:56,529
you want to have one of these on.

212
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,231
She's right, Sheriff.

213
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,574
We're not going with you
unless you put it on.

214
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:02,660
I don't have time to argue.

215
00:13:02,661 --> 00:13:04,404
[Vic] Oh, Jesus.

216
00:14:16,568 --> 00:14:18,937
[breathing heavily]

217
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:40,458
No.

218
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:13,241
Branch.

219
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,493
Branch.

220
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:21,624
[breathing heavily]

221
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:03,799
His, uh...

222
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,712
truck was parked about 100
yards or so down the bank.

223
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:14,727
His deputy's uniform and his hat were
in the truck along with his phone.

224
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:17,222
Box of shotgun shells in the back.

225
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:19,849
Okay.

226
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:26,564
[Vic] Should we move the body?

227
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,443
No.

228
00:16:33,454 --> 00:16:35,414
Walt, I think we know what happened here.

229
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:37,083
Doesn't matter.

230
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:39,043
We still got to do the work.

231
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:41,370
We still got to write up the report.

232
00:16:42,714 --> 00:16:45,549
Branch Connally was a
deputy in my department.

233
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,921
He gets the same thorough investigation
that anybody else would get.

234
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:52,514
I wasn't suggesting that we don't...

235
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:58,145
I want to know every detail about
every minute of his last days.

236
00:16:58,146 --> 00:17:00,389
Every minute I didn't get to him.

237
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:04,777
Determining time of death is gonna
be hard because of the cold water.

238
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:06,271
I don't care.

239
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:09,941
We're gonna try.

240
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:16,364
I ignored everything,
everything leading up to this.

241
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:20,076
I'm not gonna ignore anything now.

242
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,125
Need me to take pictures of the body?

243
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:29,676
No.

244
00:17:29,677 --> 00:17:31,796
Give me the camera.

245
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:37,551
I'll do it.

246
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,226
Vic, you...

247
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:49,605
You got any of those rubber gloves?

248
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:53,283
What?

249
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:56,570
Just never seen you use gloves before.

250
00:17:58,915 --> 00:18:00,574
Well...

251
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,288
I've never lost a deputy before.

252
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:14,847
I'm gonna go back through Branch's
truck a bit more carefully,

253
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:18,976
see if the shotgun shells match,
check the call log on his cellphone.

254
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:24,023
After that, head over to his house,
take a look with fresh eyes.

255
00:18:24,024 --> 00:18:26,733
I was... I was there earlier, but I...

256
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:28,602
Yeah. Of course.

257
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,652
So, who's gonna tell Cady?

258
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:46,586
[engine shuts off]

259
00:18:46,587 --> 00:18:50,666
[breathes deeply]

260
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:56,089
Cady, I'm sorry.

261
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,633
It's Branch.

262
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,304
[breathes deeply]

263
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,682
We found Branch.

264
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:10,228
It's not good.

265
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:14,648
Oh, shit.

266
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:28,461
[Cady] Hey. I thought I heard you pull up.

267
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:30,998
What happened? What's going on?

268
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:34,168
Ferg, what happened?

269
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,464
Is he okay?

270
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:43,261
He... He's... [clears throat]

271
00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:46,555
He's dead, isn't he?

272
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:49,816
[Ferg] He committed...

273
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,777
[clears throat]

274
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:53,771
He killed himself.

275
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:00,569
[crying] I'm so sorry, Cady.

276
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:20,714
Truth is that the Branch that we
knew was gone a long time ago.

277
00:20:26,437 --> 00:20:28,889
I know this wasn't easy on you, Ferg.

278
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:32,268
I'm glad you were the one to tell me.

279
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:36,063
I was the last one to see him alive.

280
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,195
I had to go get the keys to his squad car.

281
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:51,253
[Cady] Just doing your job.

282
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:55,966
I mean, he knew... He knew that.
You were always a good friend.

283
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:57,835
No, I wasn't.

284
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:02,715
I was jealous.

285
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:07,978
And I wished for bad
things to happen to him.

286
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:10,557
Now it just seems so stupid.

287
00:21:15,028 --> 00:21:17,605
[sighs]

288
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:22,109
It's okay.

289
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:24,904
It's okay, Ferg.

290
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:28,199
It's okay.

291
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:43,256
[Walt] 196.

292
00:21:44,265 --> 00:21:45,724
Okay, that's it.

293
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:47,976
- Out, Walt.
- What?

294
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:51,063
Look, I said you could sit there as
long as you kept your mouth shut.

295
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:53,315
- Sorry. I will.
- No, you won't.

296
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:56,436
I-I don't blame you,
but it rattles my nerves.

297
00:21:57,111 --> 00:21:58,987
Well, I need to know what happened.

298
00:21:58,988 --> 00:22:00,113
I told you.

299
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:03,367
Birdshot to the head at
extremely close range.

300
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:05,369
I found wadding from a
shotgun shell in the wound

301
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:10,707
and, as you have so rigorously
pointed out, 196 pieces of shot.

302
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,626
All consistent with a
self-inflicted gunshot.

303
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:15,003
Suicide.

304
00:22:15,004 --> 00:22:16,588
You sure?

305
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:18,048
Consistent with suicide.

306
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,717
I mean, I have more work to do
before I can confirm anything,

307
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:24,930
and all due respect, Walt, I had
planned on doing that work alone.

308
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:26,056
I need to run a couple more tests

309
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:28,558
before I can release the body
to the family, so if you can...

310
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,394
You can take your time, Doc.

311
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:32,479
I haven't found the family yet.

312
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,647
And I still need them
to I.D. the body, so...

313
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:38,735
Well, Walt, we know who it is.
I mean, I gave him that scar.

314
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:41,280
Well, technically, I guess
we gave him that scar.

315
00:22:41,281 --> 00:22:43,399
You're not releasing him
till I find the family.

316
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:46,193
Okay.

317
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:51,240
[sighs]

318
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,620
[mid-tempo music playing]

319
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:00,340
[Henry] You do know we serve food here.

320
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:02,335
[Walt] I'm not hungry.

321
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:09,182
How are you doing?

322
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:13,645
Well... checked three shells,

323
00:23:13,646 --> 00:23:19,025
all from the box of number 4 game
loads that Branch had in his truck.

324
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:21,903
All came out to the exact
same pellet count.

325
00:23:21,904 --> 00:23:23,696
Not one anomaly.

326
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:25,657
I meant how are you doing?

327
00:23:25,658 --> 00:23:28,319
Better than Branch.

328
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:36,243
Walt, I know what it feels like
to have a death weigh on you.

329
00:23:37,628 --> 00:23:39,963
I think about Hector every day.

330
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:41,298
I wonder if there is anything I can...

331
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:43,167
Six pellets are missing.

332
00:23:43,676 --> 00:23:45,677
All these shells have 202.

333
00:23:45,678 --> 00:23:49,382
Branch's head wound only had 196, so...

334
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:51,724
Six pellets are missing.

335
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:53,310
Probably washed away in the river.

336
00:23:53,311 --> 00:23:55,304
And this proves what?

337
00:23:57,648 --> 00:24:01,477
Are you trying to turn this suicide
into a murder to ease your conscience?

338
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,570
Or is this so you have another reason

339
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:06,566
to go after Nighthorse as
the most likely suspect?

340
00:25:13,266 --> 00:25:15,884
[Ruby over radio]
Walt, I got Vic for you.

341
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:20,397
Go ahead.

342
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:22,649
[Vic] So, I'm at Branch's house.

343
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,568
And I found some business cards.

344
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:26,736
Branch started working for his dad.

345
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:28,196
[Walt] Doing what?

346
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:30,740
Vice Presidenting.

347
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:34,327
You find out, uh,
anything about the, um...

348
00:25:34,328 --> 00:25:37,205
Well, you saw the note on the computer.

349
00:25:37,206 --> 00:25:39,082
But I also found a bunch
of pills in a drawer

350
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,418
that I recognize from a
case a few months back.

351
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:43,211
He stole them from evidence?

352
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:45,088
Yeah, looks like it.

353
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:47,257
So, he was self-medicating.

354
00:25:47,258 --> 00:25:50,969
Left a self-loathing note.
We've both seen this before.

355
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:54,139
I know we don't want to admit
it, but it looks like suicide.

356
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,602
Walt, listen, I... I know that you're gonna
try and take responsibility for this,

357
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:00,395
but you didn't even fire him.

358
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:02,772
After everything that he did,
you only suspended him.

359
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:04,816
I'm the one that he was mad at.

360
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:08,736
I'm the one that he had an
entire file of research on.

361
00:26:08,737 --> 00:26:09,862
[cell phone chimes]

362
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:12,191
If he blamed anyone, it was me, okay?

363
00:26:12,783 --> 00:26:15,702
So, what do you think that he
meant by "I can't fix this"?

364
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:17,745
Do you think he was talking
about us and the job,

365
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:19,747
or do you think he did something else?

366
00:26:19,748 --> 00:26:21,784
[Walt] Vic, I got to go.

367
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:49,152
[Barlow] Mother Superior says,
"Well, Monsignor, it's usually $150,

368
00:26:49,153 --> 00:26:51,946
but with the clerical
discount, it'll be $75."

369
00:26:51,947 --> 00:26:54,240
[laughter]

370
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:57,910
Now, there's a PG-13 version
of that story for the family,

371
00:26:57,911 --> 00:26:59,829
but it's not half as funny.

372
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,782
[laughter]

373
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,000
Oh.

374
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:06,127
Gentlemen, if this is
your idea of a stripper,

375
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:08,213
I'm gonna have to kick all your asses.

376
00:27:08,214 --> 00:27:10,374
- [laughter]
- It wasn't me.

377
00:27:11,718 --> 00:27:13,510
Barlow, I need a word.

378
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:14,678
This is a private dinner.

379
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:16,722
If you need to talk to
me, you call my office,

380
00:27:16,723 --> 00:27:18,515
and we'll get you put on my calendar.

381
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:20,183
[Walt] I tried that.

382
00:27:20,184 --> 00:27:22,268
And my secretary told you I was here?

383
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:24,521
- I'm gonna have to fire her.
- [laughter]

384
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:26,398
You told me you were here.

385
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,650
I... Oh.

386
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:31,361
I am way too buzzed to
play Sherlock Holmes.

387
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:34,740
Whatever it is you came to say,
you just go ahead and say it.

388
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:38,159
Really, Barlow, please.
This... This needs to be in private.

389
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,656
Sheriff, anything you got to say to me you
can say in front of my partners-to-be.

390
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,499
It's Branch.

391
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,584
Yeah, I know. He's late.

392
00:27:45,585 --> 00:27:47,335
It's not the first time.

393
00:27:47,336 --> 00:27:49,504
He's not coming.

394
00:27:49,505 --> 00:27:51,624
Why in the hell not?

395
00:27:52,717 --> 00:27:54,835
Gentlemen, please.

396
00:28:13,946 --> 00:28:15,731
He's dead.

397
00:28:16,407 --> 00:28:19,033
Branch is dead.

398
00:28:19,034 --> 00:28:21,361
He's been shot.

399
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:25,957
I found him.

400
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:27,083
He had his phone on him.

401
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:28,752
That's...

402
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:30,704
how I knew to come here.

403
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:35,793
But he...

404
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:43,050
Who?

405
00:28:46,312 --> 00:28:48,104
Who shot him?

406
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:54,353
Well, it looks, um... self-inflicted.

407
00:28:55,738 --> 00:28:57,564
No.

408
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:01,193
No. No, no, no, no.

409
00:29:02,495 --> 00:29:03,821
No.

410
00:29:05,832 --> 00:29:07,282
No!

411
00:29:18,886 --> 00:29:20,754
He's my son.

412
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:26,969
He's my son.

413
00:29:29,938 --> 00:29:32,099
My only son.

414
00:30:00,386 --> 00:30:01,553
[gasps]

415
00:30:01,554 --> 00:30:03,422
[thud, tires screech]

416
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:06,717
Shit.

417
00:30:07,976 --> 00:30:09,762
[dinging]

418
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:30,699
Shit.

419
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,842
[sobbing]

420
00:31:39,318 --> 00:31:43,529
[boy] Dear Hector, if you are not
dead, will you please help me?

421
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,949
Sometimes my uncle drinks too much,

422
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,701
and then he gets really
angry and he hits my mom.

423
00:31:48,702 --> 00:31:52,580
I'm not big enough to make
him stop, but you are.

424
00:31:52,581 --> 00:31:56,709
[woman] Hector, every day my son comes
home from school beaten to a pulp.

425
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,962
I tell him to fight back, but he refuses.

426
00:31:58,963 --> 00:32:01,881
Please help my son
find the fighter within.

427
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:04,300
[man] Hector, all the money
I've been saving is gone.

428
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:06,344
I've been working every day
since I was 13 trying to save.

429
00:32:06,345 --> 00:32:08,054
[woman 2] I just had a beautiful baby girl.

430
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:10,682
When my boyfriend saw her,
he knew she wasn't his.

431
00:32:10,683 --> 00:32:12,350
[man 2] Please, justice for my wife,

432
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:13,935
who was mugged getting off
her shift at the hospital.

433
00:32:13,936 --> 00:32:16,855
[boy 2] Hector, you're the only one who
knows how scared I am to go to school.

434
00:32:16,856 --> 00:32:18,690
[woman 3] He can hit me all he
wants, but if he touches...

435
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:21,526
[woman 4] My son is missing, and I
know it's my ex-husband who has him.

436
00:32:21,527 --> 00:32:22,443
- Hector.
- Hector.

437
00:32:22,444 --> 00:32:23,361
- Hector.
- Hector.

438
00:32:23,362 --> 00:32:24,278
- Hector.
- Hector.

439
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,397
Hector.

440
00:32:43,883 --> 00:32:45,667
[sniffles]

441
00:33:02,776 --> 00:33:04,311
[grunts]

442
00:33:06,363 --> 00:33:07,773
[sighs]

443
00:33:18,876 --> 00:33:20,452
[clanking]

444
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:44,935
[Walt] You're messing up my crime scene.

445
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:47,520
[Vic] The river already did that.

446
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,317
[Walt] You okay?

447
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,321
[Vic] I did it again.

448
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:58,031
What?

449
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:03,954
Another man is dead because of me.

450
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,798
I'm toxic.

451
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,838
You should just stay away from
me 'cause I'm bad for people.

452
00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:16,800
And really bad for possums.

453
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:19,226
Or is it opossum?

454
00:34:19,227 --> 00:34:21,437
Possum, opossum.

455
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:23,815
I don't even know.

456
00:34:23,816 --> 00:34:26,059
Doesn't matter. He's dead.

457
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,944
Vic, that's...

458
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:33,158
Did you know that I came
to Wyoming to start over?

459
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,078
Like, I-I left Philly to get
away from all of that shit.

460
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,665
But you can't... Can't start over.

461
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,083
There are no second chances.

462
00:34:42,084 --> 00:34:46,462
Your shit just follows
you everywhere you go,

463
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:51,467
and you just keep making the same
goddamn mistakes over and over again.

464
00:34:51,468 --> 00:34:53,552
Maybe...

465
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:57,799
Maybe the point is to keep trying.

466
00:34:58,308 --> 00:35:02,061
Maybe getting it right just
one time is good enough.

467
00:35:02,062 --> 00:35:04,396
- Come on. Let's get you out of here.
- Oh.

468
00:35:04,397 --> 00:35:06,858
[chuckles]

469
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:12,822
Did you know that my dad used
to call me "The Terror"?

470
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:14,157
He's right.

471
00:35:14,158 --> 00:35:15,616
You know, I'm... I am the terror

472
00:35:15,617 --> 00:35:19,453
because everyone who gets too close
to me either dies or they leave.

473
00:35:19,454 --> 00:35:21,455
So, you know... Don't you touch me!

474
00:35:21,456 --> 00:35:23,415
Uh! [screams]

475
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:25,744
[breathing heavily]

476
00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:27,670
No.

477
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:31,458
- Come on.
- No. No.

478
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:33,843
Fine.

479
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:36,338
Gonna be fine.

480
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:42,719
[knock on door]

481
00:35:45,313 --> 00:35:47,523
Did my dad send you?

482
00:35:47,524 --> 00:35:48,892
I sent me.

483
00:35:49,735 --> 00:35:51,944
I made you waffles.

484
00:35:51,945 --> 00:35:54,398
Food eases sorrow.

485
00:35:54,948 --> 00:35:56,908
Have you even spoken to your dad?

486
00:35:56,909 --> 00:35:58,526
No.

487
00:35:59,452 --> 00:36:00,745
Have you?

488
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:02,454
Yes.

489
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:05,291
Or should I say I talked at him.

490
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:07,877
[silverware clatters]

491
00:36:07,878 --> 00:36:13,292
Branch's death has him
immersed in his work.

492
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:17,511
It's okay. I... need time
to be with my own thoughts.

493
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:20,424
I have been thinking about Branch, too.

494
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:23,802
How much he helped me.

495
00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:27,855
I would like to return his bail money.

496
00:36:27,856 --> 00:36:30,775
Henry, you don't have that kind of money.

497
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:32,985
And besides, I don't think
it matters much to him now.

498
00:36:32,986 --> 00:36:36,189
My freedom cost a lot of people.

499
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:42,245
I would at least like to return the
legal defense money that was donated.

500
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:44,747
Do you have records of who
contributed and how much?

501
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:48,660
Not really. It was kind
of a pass-the-hat thing.

502
00:36:50,254 --> 00:36:53,505
But I have copies of all the
affidavits that people wrote for you.

503
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:57,135
That should be close to a complete
list of the people who donated.

504
00:36:57,136 --> 00:36:59,345
I have those files. I'll get them.

505
00:36:59,346 --> 00:37:01,472
No.

506
00:37:01,473 --> 00:37:03,008
They can wait.

507
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,261
Eat.

508
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:25,738
You know the hardest part?

509
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:34,622
Realizing how little I feel about
someone who once meant so much to me.

510
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:43,340
[sighs]

511
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:48,636
[groans]

512
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:13,328
If you're looking for your possum, I
buried him by that tree over there.

513
00:38:15,172 --> 00:38:17,290
Isn't the water cold?

514
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,543
Yep.

515
00:38:20,886 --> 00:38:23,296
What are you doing?

516
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:29,643
Looking for the missing birdshot from
the shotgun shell that killed Branch.

517
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:33,640
Planning on dredging the
entire river or just...

518
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:38,777
Hey, Walt, what's this gonna prove?

519
00:38:38,778 --> 00:38:40,522
Don't know yet.

520
00:38:41,865 --> 00:38:45,034
Yeah, I think you do.

521
00:38:45,035 --> 00:38:47,703
If you find the pellets, it just
proves what we already know.

522
00:38:47,704 --> 00:38:50,789
If you don't find them, it just
means that they're buried by mud

523
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,167
or they were carried
away by the stream or...

524
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:57,163
If it was me instead of him, I'd
hope you'd do the same thing.

525
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:02,710
Do you know who you sound like?

526
00:39:03,387 --> 00:39:04,754
Look at you.

527
00:39:05,931 --> 00:39:07,598
You've been up all night, and...

528
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,561
And you're planning on panning an
entire river for a couple of BBS.

529
00:39:12,562 --> 00:39:15,689
It's like Branch's obsessive
behavior was contagious.

530
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,691
I missed something, Vic.

531
00:39:17,692 --> 00:39:20,228
I didn't pay close enough attention.

532
00:39:20,904 --> 00:39:23,406
I didn't see how bad things
had gotten for Branch.

533
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:25,866
You have got to stop
blaming yourself for this.

534
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:28,035
It's too late.

535
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:31,205
I'm not gonna miss anything more.

536
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:33,458
If I find the rest of the birdshot,

537
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:37,586
maybe this'll all make more sense
to me than it does right now.

538
00:39:37,587 --> 00:39:42,292
And if I don't, at least I'll know
it wasn't through lack of trying.

539
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,429
I think I'm gonna be sick.

540
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,923
Well, try to get clear of the crime scene.

541
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:52,927
Jesus.

542
00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:59,817
Hey, Ruby said she didn't know
where either of you guys were,

543
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:01,645
so I thought you'd be down...

544
00:40:02,446 --> 00:40:04,105
What's he doing?

545
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:07,533
Grasping at anything that will prevent him

546
00:40:07,534 --> 00:40:10,536
from having to face the fact
that Branch committed suicide.

547
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:11,620
[gunshot]

548
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:12,788
Shit! Jesus.

549
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:17,168
Guns make a lot of noise,
especially shotguns.

550
00:40:17,169 --> 00:40:21,922
Anybody could hear my gun sure
as hell could hear Branch's.

551
00:40:21,923 --> 00:40:24,091
Ferg, get out there.

552
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:28,220
See if you can find anyone who was
in earshot the last couple of days.

553
00:40:28,221 --> 00:40:31,098
I'm supposed to just ask anyone
that lives within a mile of...

554
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:32,141
[gunshot]

555
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:35,387
Ferg, why are you still here?

556
00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:48,449
Nothing to see here.

557
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,784
Just, you know...

558
00:40:50,785 --> 00:40:52,195
move along.

559
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,702
[organ music playing]

560
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:07,718
Ruby.

561
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:10,012
Are you sure he knows it's today?

562
00:41:10,013 --> 00:41:11,972
I reminded him three times.

563
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:14,008
He should be here.

564
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,136
[door closes]

565
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:21,200
[Barlow] Branch Connally, my son...

566
00:42:22,419 --> 00:42:25,371
did not take his own life.

567
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:32,044
He was a deputy of the Absaroka
County Sheriff's Department.

568
00:42:34,973 --> 00:42:37,676
And that job took his life.

569
00:42:42,105 --> 00:42:48,936
Branch emptied himself out...
trying to help other people.

570
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:52,148
Trying to help all of you.

571
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,401
Help the sheriff.

572
00:42:56,703 --> 00:43:02,742
He sacrificed himself, even
when it went unappreciated.

573
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:08,998
He would've been sheriff
himself one day if only...

574
00:43:17,516 --> 00:43:19,467
The, um...

575
00:43:20,101 --> 00:43:24,472
The Connally family settled this county.

576
00:43:26,149 --> 00:43:31,396
And a lot of Connallys...
laid down their lives for it.

577
00:43:37,494 --> 00:43:40,906
But not before they left their mark.

578
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:48,128
Branch was supposed to have
built on what I had done,

579
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:51,290
j-just like I did from my daddy.

580
00:43:53,092 --> 00:43:55,503
But now, uh...

581
00:43:57,847 --> 00:43:59,674
it's the end of the line.

582
00:44:01,267 --> 00:44:03,845
We, uh...

583
00:44:05,188 --> 00:44:07,648
We all let him down.

584
00:44:07,649 --> 00:44:10,359
But that's, uh...

585
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,563
that's the past now.

586
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,608
So, let's, uh...

587
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:24,073
Let's try to carry him in
our hearts going forward.

588
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:27,493
He...

589
00:45:00,076 --> 00:45:02,745
Did you notice who wasn't here?

590
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:04,121
Lucian?

591
00:45:04,122 --> 00:45:06,290
[Walt] Lucian doesn't do funerals, no.

592
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:08,208
Nighthorse.

593
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:09,744
Ah.

594
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,915
I'm not obsessing, Henry. I'm observing.

595
00:45:14,674 --> 00:45:17,718
Nighthorse was Branch's biggest
benefactor during the election.

596
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:19,886
You'd think he would make an appearance.

597
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,346
Walt, do you think it might be a good idea

598
00:45:21,347 --> 00:45:23,932
to take a break from your
crusade just for today?

599
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:25,259
Ferg.

600
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:29,563
When you brought Branch the
personal items from his desk,

601
00:45:29,564 --> 00:45:32,316
do you remember seeing a bag
full of surveillance cameras?

602
00:45:32,317 --> 00:45:34,401
Yeah, they were right on top. Why?

603
00:45:34,402 --> 00:45:37,112
'Cause I don't remember seeing
them in Branch's house.

604
00:45:37,113 --> 00:45:39,740
- Did you?
- Did I what?

605
00:45:39,741 --> 00:45:42,367
See a bag full of surveillance
cameras at Branch's house?

606
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:44,662
No, why?

607
00:45:44,663 --> 00:45:47,665
So, what do you think that means, Sheriff?

608
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:48,791
I don't know.

609
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:51,418
Maybe he put them somewhere
we haven't looked yet.

610
00:45:51,419 --> 00:45:55,631
Or maybe there was incriminating
evidence on those cameras.

611
00:45:55,632 --> 00:45:59,210
And Jacob Nighthorse
broke in and stole it.

612
00:46:12,482 --> 00:46:14,107
Cady.

613
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:15,560
Cady.

614
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:18,445
How you holding up?

615
00:46:18,446 --> 00:46:20,698
Oh, you know. [chuckles]

616
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:22,115
Yeah.

617
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:24,785
You want to get some breakfast?

618
00:46:24,786 --> 00:46:26,119
Uh, I-I can't.

619
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,332
Branch's family invited me to a private
ceremony at the grave site, so...

620
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:32,543
Of course. Makes sense.

621
00:46:32,544 --> 00:46:36,421
Not really, but I guess they don't
know that Branch and I broke up.

622
00:46:36,422 --> 00:46:40,133
It's awkward because I've never
met Branch's mom before.

623
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:41,635
That's good of you to go, so...

624
00:46:41,636 --> 00:46:43,428
Yeah.

625
00:46:43,429 --> 00:46:44,805
Um...

626
00:46:44,806 --> 00:46:46,340
How are you?

627
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:47,892
I'm fine.

628
00:46:47,893 --> 00:46:49,393
Really?

629
00:46:49,394 --> 00:46:51,019
That's not what I'm hearing.

630
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,848
What are you hearing?

631
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:59,979
That you're having a hard time
accepting the reality of this.

632
00:47:00,906 --> 00:47:05,234
- You talking to Henry?
- Doesn't matter who I'm talking to, Dad.

633
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,829
You got to stop carrying
around all this guilt.

634
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,414
You couldn't have done anything.

635
00:47:10,415 --> 00:47:11,874
Branch changed.

636
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:15,001
I didn't even recognize him at the end.

637
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:19,540
What he did, it was... It was really sad.

638
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:25,337
But it happened, and it wasn't your fault.

639
00:47:33,772 --> 00:47:35,731
You know what?
Let's go to breakfast. Let's go.

640
00:47:35,732 --> 00:47:37,023
No, no. You can't.

641
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:39,777
I-I don't think that you
should be alone right now.

642
00:47:39,778 --> 00:47:41,570
Neither should Branch's parents.

643
00:47:41,571 --> 00:47:44,114
They just lost their only son.

644
00:47:44,115 --> 00:47:47,735
Now, sometimes we got to do
things we don't want to, Punk.

645
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:52,873
But what do I say to them?

646
00:47:52,874 --> 00:47:54,993
You don't have to say a word.

647
00:48:11,726 --> 00:48:12,844
Thanks.

648
00:48:39,337 --> 00:48:43,089
- Hey. Are you following me?
- Not anymore.

649
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,716
Let me put this another way.

650
00:48:44,717 --> 00:48:46,844
Why are you following me?

651
00:48:46,845 --> 00:48:48,470
You know why.

652
00:48:48,471 --> 00:48:50,430
Okay, I give you my word.

653
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,642
I will have no contact whatsoever
with Jacob Nighthorse today.

654
00:48:53,643 --> 00:48:55,678
There. You satisfied?

655
00:48:56,896 --> 00:48:58,973
For today, at least.

656
00:49:16,207 --> 00:49:17,165
Good morning.

657
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,834
Standing Bear.

658
00:49:18,835 --> 00:49:20,168
Hey.

659
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:22,629
I heard you was out.

660
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,091
It's good to see you breathing
the air of your ancestors.

661
00:49:26,092 --> 00:49:27,676
You have no idea.

662
00:49:27,677 --> 00:49:29,928
I do, actually.

663
00:49:29,929 --> 00:49:33,724
I did a nickel in Rawlins
back in the '90s.

664
00:49:33,725 --> 00:49:36,518
Like to buy some oranges?

665
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:38,687
I also got some buffalo jerky.

666
00:49:38,688 --> 00:49:42,440
Or maybe some dream catchers.

667
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:44,068
The turistos love them.

668
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:47,029
No, no, thank you. I am good.

669
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,322
I actually stopped to pay you back.

670
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:50,983
For what?

671
00:49:52,243 --> 00:49:54,528
You contributed to my defense fund.

672
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:57,873
You ain't got to pay me back for that.

673
00:49:57,874 --> 00:50:00,208
I donated that money.

674
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:02,586
Never meant to see it again.

675
00:50:02,587 --> 00:50:04,546
Or you, for that matter.

676
00:50:04,547 --> 00:50:07,549
Well, here I am.

677
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:08,717
And here is your money.

678
00:50:08,718 --> 00:50:10,552
I ain't touching it.

679
00:50:10,553 --> 00:50:14,598
Ain't often an Indian goes into
the white man's justice system

680
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:16,058
and comes out again.

681
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:19,185
Ain't often an Indian
gets any kind of justice,

682
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:22,140
especially now that Hector's gone.

683
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,987
You know, people still put
notes into Hector's jar.

684
00:50:36,955 --> 00:50:39,205
Out there at the old wall.

685
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:41,416
If it makes them feel comfort...

686
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:43,085
that's good.

687
00:50:43,086 --> 00:50:47,248
But it's a shame ain't no one
to answer those notes no more.

688
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:54,964
How about an orange for the road?

689
00:50:56,432 --> 00:50:58,516
Keep the change.

690
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:00,469
Hey.

691
00:51:05,775 --> 00:51:08,144
[engine turns over]

692
00:51:10,989 --> 00:51:12,781
[Ruby] As soon as I get
the messages checked,

693
00:51:12,782 --> 00:51:14,783
I'll put on a pot of coffee.

694
00:51:14,784 --> 00:51:16,402
[door closes]

695
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:25,828
- [sighs]
- [clicking]

696
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:31,334
[Vic clears throat]

697
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:41,935
- What the hell are you doing?!
- I wasn't, Vic!

698
00:51:41,936 --> 00:51:44,062
- I am not gonna lose you, too!
- I wasn't!

699
00:51:44,063 --> 00:51:45,605
The gun's not even loaded.

700
00:51:45,606 --> 00:51:47,191
- What?
- See?

701
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:48,517
Empty.

702
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:52,487
I couldn't stop...

703
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:56,608
thinking about the length
of the barrel of this shotgun.

704
00:51:57,743 --> 00:52:02,823
Whether it was even possible for Branch
to pull the trigger with his hands.

705
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,543
It would be difficult.

706
00:52:06,544 --> 00:52:08,371
But it would be possible.

707
00:52:13,718 --> 00:52:17,838
Even if he couldn't, he could use his toe.

708
00:52:20,183 --> 00:52:22,934
Okay, then, so it was suicide.

709
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:25,854
Will you move on now?

710
00:52:25,855 --> 00:52:27,598
Please.

711
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:33,145
Branch was obsessed with his case.

712
00:52:34,405 --> 00:52:38,533
[sighs] We thought he was
wrong, but he was right.

713
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:42,529
I owed it to Branch to keep
on digging, but, uh...

714
00:52:43,873 --> 00:52:48,411
I think I have to stop
fighting this and just, uh...

715
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:52,839
just admit that what
happened happened, so...

716
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,794
Okay. So, then, you're not
gonna need this, right?

717
00:52:57,386 --> 00:52:59,012
Shit. God damn it.

718
00:52:59,013 --> 00:53:00,597
- No, wait, I'll just...
- I got it.

719
00:53:00,598 --> 00:53:02,341
It's fine.

720
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:14,652
What?

721
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:18,240
How'd the dirt get in the shell?
Never left the gun.

722
00:53:18,241 --> 00:53:21,527
- There's dirt inside the shell casing?
- Uh-huh.

723
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:33,838
That would mean that somebody
put a spent shell back in the gun.

724
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,759
Someone tampered with that shotgun
before we got to the scene.

725
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,345
So, I went all over Branch's
house and the garage.

726
00:53:40,346 --> 00:53:43,424
No sign of the cameras
or the bag they were in.

727
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:48,346
I'm sorry.
Am... I interrupting something?

728
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:52,433
Branch didn't die the
way we thought he did.

729
00:53:53,943 --> 00:53:56,153
What we found down by
the river was staged.

730
00:53:56,154 --> 00:53:59,323
And whoever did it made sure
all the evidence washed away.

731
00:53:59,324 --> 00:54:03,402
I already know someone with a history
of staging fake death scenes.

732
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:05,696
Nighthorse?

733
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:07,698
Nighthorse.

734
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:11,251
[Walt] Doc...

735
00:54:11,252 --> 00:54:14,629
I need you to change the cause of
death on Branch's death certificate.

736
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,048
- I can't.
- Well, you have to.

737
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:20,010
It wasn't suicide. It was murder.
I found new evidence.

738
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:21,678
It's too late, Walt.

739
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:22,846
Don't you even want to hear it?

740
00:54:22,847 --> 00:54:27,017
Honestly, I don't really like discussing
tragedy after work hours, so, no.

741
00:54:27,018 --> 00:54:29,644
Come on, Doc. You saw Branch's wound.

742
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:31,604
You think after he shot
himself in the face,

743
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:33,564
he ejected the shell,
picked it up off the ground,

744
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:35,192
and put it back in the gun?

745
00:54:35,193 --> 00:54:37,402
'Cause there was dirt in the spent shell.

746
00:54:37,403 --> 00:54:39,904
That's the only way
this could be a suicide.

747
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:42,157
Okay, even so, Walt, the
paperwork's already been filed.

748
00:54:42,158 --> 00:54:43,449
There's nothing I can do.

749
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,827
So, you're gonna hide behind
some stupid bureaucratic process

750
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:47,329
'cause you don't want to do your job?

751
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:49,122
Wait a minute. Are you kidding me?

752
00:54:49,123 --> 00:54:50,374
My job description says nothing

753
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:54,336
about being your unofficial,
unpaid forensic researcher.

754
00:54:54,337 --> 00:54:56,296
Officially, that body was
supposed to go to Laramie.

755
00:54:56,297 --> 00:54:59,674
I did the autopsy as a personal
favor out of friendship.

756
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:00,633
Now you're gonna walk in here

757
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:03,511
and you're gonna criticize me for...
for not breaking the law?

758
00:55:03,512 --> 00:55:05,347
I'm sorry. I'm not asking
you to break the law.

759
00:55:05,348 --> 00:55:07,473
Actually, that's exactly what
you're asking me to do, Walt.

760
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:10,185
I cannot legally alter
that death certificate

761
00:55:10,186 --> 00:55:12,520
unless I'm ordered to do so by a court.

762
00:55:12,521 --> 00:55:13,688
So, if you want a change,

763
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,899
you're gonna have to present
evidence in a court of law.

764
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,194
And if you want to prove that
Branch didn't commit suicide,

765
00:55:19,195 --> 00:55:20,278
I'm telling you right now,

766
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:22,322
you're gonna need a little bit
more than just some dirt.

767
00:55:22,323 --> 00:55:23,990
Hey, listen.

768
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:25,909
You two rummies don't
keep it down out here,

769
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:28,078
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

770
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,080
What are you doing in Henry's office?

771
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:33,208
Oh, you know, just going over
the books, learning the ropes.

772
00:55:33,209 --> 00:55:37,295
It ain't easy with you two crackers
out here making a lot of racket.

773
00:55:37,296 --> 00:55:39,339
- Where's Henry?
- He's off the clock.

774
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,840
It's none of my concern.

775
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:43,718
Why are you walking around
like you own this place?

776
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:48,639
'Cause. Ever since your boy
signed the deed over to me, I do.

777
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,267
[chuckles]

778
00:55:50,268 --> 00:55:52,470
Next round's on the house.

779
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:42,853
[lid closes]

780
00:56:52,955 --> 00:56:55,907
[sighs]

781
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:03,298
[beep]

782
00:57:03,299 --> 00:57:05,292
[telephone ringing]

783
00:57:06,427 --> 00:57:08,553
[beep]

784
00:57:08,554 --> 00:57:09,637
Hello?

785
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:10,721
Hey, it's me.

786
00:57:10,722 --> 00:57:14,600
So, I have been to his house,
the office, the construction site.

787
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:16,853
There is no sign of Nighthorse anywhere.

788
00:57:16,854 --> 00:57:20,982
It's possible I alerted Jacob to our
interest in him earlier tonight.

789
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:22,317
[Vic] How?

790
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:23,651
Malachi.

791
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:26,446
He overheard me talking to Doc
Weston at the Red Pony, so...

792
00:57:26,447 --> 00:57:28,656
Shit.

793
00:57:28,657 --> 00:57:32,702
[Walt] Yeah, uh, was there something
else you wanted to talk to me about?

794
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:34,745
What? No. Why?

795
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:36,122
Well, it's, uh...

796
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:40,911
It's just that I-I saw you called
earlier and didn't leave a message.

797
00:57:42,046 --> 00:57:44,088
Um, yeah, no, that was nothing.

798
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:45,298
[Walt] You sure?

799
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:47,592
Yeah. Get some sleep, Walt.

800
00:57:47,593 --> 00:57:49,211
[beep]

801
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,964
[sighs]

802
00:58:00,022 --> 00:58:02,433
[sighs]

803
00:58:14,161 --> 00:58:16,614
[vehicles approaching]

804
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:22,202
[gun cocks]

805
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:07,380
Tell me, Sheriff.

806
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:12,385
When General Custer looked out
over the field at Little Bighorn,

807
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:15,172
do you think he had a moment to reflect?

808
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:17,265
I suspect.

809
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:21,519
How do you think he characterized
his failure in his own mind?

810
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,357
You think he felt he had
underestimated the Indians?

811
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:28,234
Overestimated himself?

812
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:29,777
What do you want, Jacob?

813
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:32,029
I just want to talk.

814
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:35,116
No lawyers, no bullshit.

815
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:36,618
[Walt] No bullshit?

816
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:38,453
What do you call this display?

817
00:59:38,454 --> 00:59:42,457
This is just... backup.

818
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:46,169
What do you want from me?

819
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:47,746
Your head on a pike.

820
00:59:48,631 --> 00:59:52,049
Or barring that, prison.

821
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:53,843
For what?

822
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:57,054
What did I ever really do to you, Walt?

823
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,848
I believe you murdered Branch.

824
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:00,224
Why would I murder Branch?

825
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:04,429
Because he exposed your soldier.
David Ridges.

826
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:08,107
Yeah.

827
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:09,693
But you killed him.

828
01:00:09,694 --> 01:00:13,571
[Walt] So, I take your
deputy, you take mine.

829
01:00:13,572 --> 01:00:17,359
Or maybe he found something
out that Ridges did for you.

830
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:21,572
Like kill my wife.

831
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:24,616
Oh.

832
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:29,337
So, that's what this is all about.

833
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:31,255
That's what this is all about.

834
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:35,259
Well, let me... put your mind at ease.

835
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,546
I don't kill women and children.

836
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:42,975
In fact, in my experience and
the experience of my people,

837
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:45,645
that's been more of a
white man's strategy.

838
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:49,357
You once said you intended to
fight the white man on his terms.

839
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:51,192
And I will.

840
01:00:51,193 --> 01:00:56,113
Harnessing the power of the
almighty dollar with casinos.

841
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:58,533
You took our land.

842
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:02,912
You killed us with guns and disease.

843
01:01:02,913 --> 01:01:05,206
You lied to us.

844
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:06,916
Shame on you!

845
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:10,294
But we were naive. We were gullible.

846
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:13,164
We never came together as
a people, so shame on us.

847
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:16,884
Look around you, Walt.

848
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:20,555
Cheyenne, Blackfoot, Sioux, Cherokee.

849
01:01:20,556 --> 01:01:27,311
Could it be we are no longer a
beaten, drunken, vanishing people?

850
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:29,021
We are united.

851
01:01:29,022 --> 01:01:32,983
We will not be harassed
and intimidated anymore.

852
01:01:32,984 --> 01:01:34,686
These men have my back!

853
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:38,615
And I have theirs.

854
01:01:38,616 --> 01:01:41,117
So, you're threatening me? Is that it?

855
01:01:41,118 --> 01:01:46,038
I'm just giving you the warning
poor General Custer never got.

856
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:49,785
Don't overestimate yourself.

857
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:54,581
And don't underestimate us.

858
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,753
Oh.

859
01:02:03,014 --> 01:02:04,599
All right, let's go!
