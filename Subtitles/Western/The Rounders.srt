00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,200
THE ROUNDERS

2
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:10,000
- Howdy, boys. Good morning.
- Mr. Love. That's the rough string?

3
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,100
- They ain't so rough.
- Then why is he all tangled up?

4
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,300
- He's new.
- He'll never be old.

5
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,600
Wait. I've hired you to tame them.

6
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:28,600
- We just quit.
- They won't cause you any trouble.

7
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,900
One or two might run out of rank,
but most of them are already broken.

8
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Take that blaze-face roan there.
I bet he's been rode 1,000 miles.

9
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,100
- Some saddlings will calm him down.
- You should have your eyes tested.

10
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,500
See the healed-over spur marks?
That means trouble.

11
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,900
He'll cripple a good cowboy.

12
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,900
He'll make a good rope pony.
Just get that tallow melted down, -

13
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,700
- and I'll probably want him for
the old lady and the kids to ride.

14
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,600
I'm paying more
than I did last year.

15
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,900
- How much?
- Say five dollars a head?

16
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,500
- Seven.
- Six.

17
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,900
- Your new man can do it for that.
- Say six and a half?

18
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,700
- Seven.
- Say seven.

19
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,100
Get the men out,
and let that string settle down.

20
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,200
You boys pick up your rigs
and walk away.

21
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,700
I'm glad you're back.
I told my wife this morning -

22
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:54,300
- I want to get started, but I
haven't heard from Ben and Howdy -

23
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
- since I bailed them out of jail.

24
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,400
- You got your bail back.
- And we're not your old friends.

25
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,200
How can you say that?
You've worked here for years.

26
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,600
- Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- Money.

27
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,900
Just like I said, boys.
Gentle as a milk-pen calf.

28
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,700
- See you around in a few days.
- I wonder why people call him Love.

29
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,700
Maybe it's because he's so clean.

30
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,300
- Tailor-made suits, nice boots ...
- Pays less than any man I know.

31
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,500
- Like now, for instance.
- Yeah, like now.

32
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,500
You must have been a mean son buck
when you were young.

33
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,800
This horse is a damn cannibal!

34
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,200
Let me have him.

35
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,500
Got a good rein on him.

36
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,300
Maybe Ed Love wasn't putting us on.
Maybe this job won't be so tough.

37
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,100
You all right, Ben?

38
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,500
I'm fine.

39
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,500
Rise and shine. Breakfast.
How do you feel?

40
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,700
I feel like
taking an axe to that roan.

41
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,200
Just like Jim Ed to leave us here
with a pen full of spoiled horses.

42
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,600
A sharp axe.

43
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,800
- I wish I was back wrangling dudes.
- Whatever made you quit?

44
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,900
A woman.

45
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,500
- A woman from back east. Toy Smith.
- That's a mighty pretty name.

46
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,700
A mighty pretty woman.
I was working near Phoenix.

47
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,800
One of those fancy spreads
for rich folks from back east.

48
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:40,100
- They had hot springs all around.
- Kind of like swimming pools.

49
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,100
I took the dudes for moonlight rides
among the cactus.

50
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Then I'd cook a meal on the campfire
and play the guitar and sing.

51
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,500
- You sing?
- I just run some words together.

52
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,300
It seems this Toy Smith thought
I was a great primitive singer.

53
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,300
- What's that?
- Primitive! I don't know.

54
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,800
At night when I finished,
Toy waited for me to go swimming.

55
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,800
She was some swimmer. And float ...
She looked like a mountain range!

56
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,500
That Toy followed me everywhere.
At dances she'd waltz me all night.

57
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,300
I couldn't see around her
with 40 pounds of her over my head.

58
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,600
- I could just hold on and pray.
- She was rich and you passed it up?

59
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,800
Not exactly. Things happened to ...
alter the course of true love.

60
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,100
Somebody else liked my singing.

61
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,900
This other girl was half as big
and twice as pretty.

62
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,300
One night I sent Toy to bed.
I told her I had to shoe a horse.

63
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,400
- At night? Who'd believe that?
- Toy would. At least I thought so.

64
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,500
I went for a swim with this girl.
I never thought Toy would do it.

65
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,100
She came at me with a hammer.

66
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,500
- Did she catch you?
- See any holes in my skull?

67
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,300
I lit out for Phoenix
and never looked back.

68
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Sometimes I wish I'd stayed
and faced Toy instead.

69
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,500
If she just hadn't been
so damn fat.

70
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,400
- Eat up. I'll start working.
- That suits me fine. Ben ...

71
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,000
- Why do you keep working here?
- I'm saving up to buy a boat.

72
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,700
I'll find a place with no grass,
because there won't be any horses.

73
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,600
- They'll cripple a man soon enough.
- You think you'll ever make it?

74
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,500
I'll make it.

75
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,300
That roan's thrown you six times,
and you're trying him today?

76
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,700
I have to.
He's gaining on me.

77
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,600
That tears it. I'll take your horse.
I'll be right back.

78
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,900
- You said you'd be right back.
- Time flies.

79
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:35,000
I hate to to do this, horse,
but that was the last straw.

80
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,100
Howdy, start the truck.
I'll run over this knot-head.

81
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:46,600
He tried to kill me, I'll kill him.
You just watch and see.

82
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,500
I'll go way back
and get a good run at him.

83
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,500
He'll never know what hit him.
That's one way to break a horse.

84
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,500
Ben, watch out!

85
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,500
- You all right, Ben?
- I'm fine.

86
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,500
Just fine.

87
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,500
- That's the last of them.
- 20 heads in four days ain't bad.

88
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,900
That is.

89
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,100
- How's it coming?
- I was just going to bring them in.

90
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,500
I was going to wait, but I couldn't.
You'll get a chance of a lifetime.

91
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,200
- The chance to earn lots of money.
- Pay no attention to him.

92
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,600
Up at winter camp,
200 strays have gone wild.

93
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,200
I want you to spend the winter there
gathering that stock.

94
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,500
It's high up, but that's no problem.
Besides, it will be like a vacation.

95
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,700
Just pay us our wages for now,
and we'll be on our way.

96
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,400
And I'll pay five dollars a head
for all you gather in.

97
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,400
Think about it.
Did you ever hear anything like it?

98
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,600
What do you say?
I say six dollars.

99
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,200
- Seven.
- Well, say seven.

100
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,000
Here's enough money
to buy your winter grub.

101
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,100
I'll keep what's coming to you.
You can pick it up in the spring.

102
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,500
You'll need a wheelbarrow
to haul it away. By the way ...

103
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,600
Bring that rough string along
and work them.

104
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,000
Sore backs and tender hoofs,
that makes gentle horses.

105
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,500
Be seeing you come spring, fellows.

106
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,100
Howdy, it comes to me we're not
the smartest cowboys who ever lived.

107
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,600
You could say that.

108
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,100
Who's coming?

109
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,300
It's Ben and Howdy.

110
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,900
I bet there's not a rabbit
within five miles of this place.

111
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,300
- Howdy, Ben.
- Where's your pa?

112
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,100
He went into town
to get some whiskey mash.

113
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,200
- Where are you headed?
- To the high country. For Jim Love.

114
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,600
- He's starving to death.
- Can you stay for supper?

115
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,900
- That suits us fine.
- Pitch the horses some hay.

116
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:48,300
- Much obliged.
- Ben, it's good to see you again.

117
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,200
You too, Meg.

118
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,700
That's what I call
real neighborly girls.

119
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:05,100
I'd say that if their pa didn't make
the best moonshine in the county.

120
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,400
Coffee, Ben?

121
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,000
- Your daughters are growing up.
- I should have had boys.

122
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,300
Women are no help.
They can't fix the windmill.

123
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,200
We used to have two windmills
back home, but we tore one down.

124
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,600
- There wasn't enough wind for two.
- You're pulling my leg.

125
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,600
How's Jim Ed? How much
did his calves weigh out this year?

126
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,700
- Around 400 pounds each.
- I had no calves to ship this year.

127
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,100
Business has been plumb bad.
Nobody drinks anymore.

128
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
We do.

129
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,100
- Would you care for a snort?
- That suits us fine.

130
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,000
Keep your eye on old Blue.

131
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,900
Watch the steps.

132
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Get out of there.

133
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,800
Some people can make clothes,
some can make lots of money, -

134
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,800
- but nobody makes better whiskey
than you, Vince Moore.

135
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,000
- More?
- I don't mind if I do.

136
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,200
Next.

137
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,500
Howdy,
can I talk to you man to man?

138
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,100
Shoot.

139
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,500
How did you get the name Howdy?

140
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,600
- I made it up.
- You did?

141
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:22,400
- Why?
- Marion.

142
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,500
That was my given name.
Marion Lewis.

143
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:31,400
You can't ride bucking horses
with that name, so I changed it.

144
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,100
I even had it drawn up and sworn at
to make it legal.

145
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,200
Now, no matter where I go
or who I meet, -

146
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,100
- first thing they do
is say "howdy."

147
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,800
- Makes me feel that they know me.
- You have a friendly streak in you.

148
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,100
Speaking of being friendly ...

149
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,400
Did you see that blaze-faced roan
we brought in today?

150
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,500
- It was the first thing I noticed.
- Ever seen such a running walk?

151
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,800
It did seem he moved easily.

152
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,100
I'd say it has the best rein
of any horse I have ever rode.

153
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,100
- That, if nothing else.
- What do you mean?

154
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,800
It runs faster than a jackrabbit
and stops when you want it to.

155
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,200
Can I have a little more
of that wonderful stuff?

156
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:39,300
A horse like that would be just fine
for a little outfit like this.

157
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,400
You could work cattle with him ...

158
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,700
And you could also just ride him
for pure ... pleasure.

159
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,400
Something else, too.
When your dogs go after a coyote, -

160
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,300
- you want to be there for the kill
so badly ...

161
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,700
- Isn't that right?
- Sure. I'd kill him with my hands.

162
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:11,200
- With that roan you'd be there.
- But he's not my horse.

163
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,900
You're wrong.

164
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,400
For a slight consideration ...

165
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:25,500
- I'll give him to you.
- I haven't got a dime to my name.

166
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,700
You didn't think
I was asking for money, did you?

167
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:36,000
- Didn't I?
- No, all I want is just ...

168
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Just eight jugs
of that wonderful stuff of yours.

169
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,100
- I don't know ...
- It'll be a long winter.

170
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,400
And a dry one.

171
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,400
Listen ...

172
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,800
You could catch that son of a buck
one hour before sunrise, -

173
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,500
- and be there
when the dogs put the bite on him.

174
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,500
- What do you say?
- I'll do it.

175
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,800
- I'll drink to that.
- So will I.

176
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,000
Home!

177
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,200
That high country is where
we'll find most of the strays.

178
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,700
All straight up and down,
and covered with buckthorn.

179
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,300
- We have to dig some ditches.
- I bet the water tower's leaking.

180
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:36,000
- We have to fix that corral fence.
- And cut wood to keep warm.

181
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:44,200
- We could be in Sedona in two days.
- Think of the back wages we'll get.

182
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,900
I wish I wasn't so damn greedy.

183
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:36,500
- We have ten that won't get away.
- We have more than that. Look.

184
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,500
Vince. Good to see you so soon.
Did you fix your windmill?

185
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,200
- How's your girls?
- How's business? Any customers?

186
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,700
- How's your hounds?
- Howdy.

187
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,400
- I want my whiskey back.
- You must be kidding.

188
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,200
I am like hell.

189
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:15,500
The first time I went hunting I was
there, right behind the hounds.

190
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,100
- That's good.
- No.

191
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:25,000
The horse ran right past the coyote.
I didn't even see the fight.

192
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,500
It was three miles before he turned.
Then it was all over.

193
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,400
Just a little patch of gray left.

194
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,700
Next morning I saddled him up
and walked him around, -

195
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,700
- and just when I thought
everything was fine, it happened.

196
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,300
He bucked me off
and ate my whiskey mash.

197
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:53,000
- A spirited horse gets hungry.
- Then I tried to plow with him.

198
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,700
- How did he work?
- Work? He ran off with the plow!

199
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,900
Tore out 200 yards of good posts
and barbed wire.

200
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:11,900
I've spent two days fixing it,
and I want my whiskey back!

201
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,100
I can't understand it.
He never gave me any trouble.

202
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,700
Why not?

203
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,800
Now please, just this one time ...
Don't buck, huh?

204
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,100
See?

205
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:40,100
- Where have you been?
- Out there in the bog.

206
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,700
- Where's Vince?
- He left with his wonderful stuff.

207
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,900
- Was he still mad?
- He hoped the roan would kick you.

208
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,900
It's going to be a long dry winter.

209
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,100
All right. Out!

210
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:25,600
What the hell are you doing here?
There's not a hen within 40 miles.

211
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,800
You can say that again.

212
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,600
TAHITI

213
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:54,100
How many more heads
do you think are still left?

214
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,500
By the tracks,
I'd say at least 100.

215
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:06,500
We'll just barely get out of here
in time to make the rodeo in Sedona.

216
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,800
I've thought about that.

217
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:17,600
Are you sure
you'll make it to Tahiti?

218
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,100
I'll make it.

219
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:28,600
Will you still open up that saloon
with girls in grass skirts?

220
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,100
I'll drink all day
and hula all night.

221
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,500
How can they quiver like that
without something coming off?

222
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,700
Good night.

223
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,400
The way that old roan
keeps throwing me ...

224
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,100
You think maybe I'm losing my touch?

225
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,700
Ben ...

226
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,900
You're not losing your touch.

227
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:18,700
- 67, 68, 69, 70.
- All mother cows and fat calves.

228
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,200
- What's wrong with that?
- That mountain is hard to climb.

229
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:28,200
There's nothing up there
but long-legged steers and bulls.

230
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,900
- Our horses aren't fast enough.
- We've got one that is.

231
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,500
- Forget it.
- There's probably 50 strays left.

232
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:46,100
You can talk all you want.
I'm not getting on that horse again!

233
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:16,300
Look at him, calm and easy.
He doesn't seem like the same horse.

234
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,400
- You could say that.
- Are you still sore?

235
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,500
Yeah, all over.

236
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,800
You'll feel better when
you're behind one of those strays.

237
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,000
That one's wilder
than mountain scenery.

238
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:44,500
- Stay here. I'll get him.
- That suits me fine.

239
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:23,700
I'm fine.
I'm just ... Oh, boy!

240
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:43,300
- Are you all right?
- How did I get back here?

241
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,500
I slung you over the black.

242
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,900
That roan ran me
between those trees on purpose.

243
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,400
- It looked that way to me.
- Where is he?

244
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:04,600
- In the corral. He followed us in.
- You still have that gun? Get it.

245
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,500
- Get it!
- Jim Ed will make us pay for him.

246
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,600
- Probably twice what he's worth.
- Will it shoot?

247
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,400
I never tried it.

248
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,900
It's Bull.

249
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,700
<   Compadres!>

250
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,400
- Are you all right, Bull?
- Come in and join us for a drink.

251
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,100
Thank you, Ben. Howdy.

252
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,600
- Here we are. Sit down.
- What brings you out here?

253
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,800
I've been riding bulls in Hi-Lo.
14th place.

254
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,100
- I saw your truck.
- We're chasing strays.

255
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,800
- Seven dollars a head.
- Calves and all?

256
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,400
- We'll have an old time in spring.
- How's the wife and kids?

257
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,800
- Fine.
- How many kids do you have now?

258
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Ten. But I haven't been home
in a week. I should go.

259
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,900
Sit down. I mean ...
Still wearing those spike spurs?

260
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,200
- All the time.
- How about that?

261
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,500
- That really tears up an animal.
- It shows him who's boss, too.

262
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:03,000
We've been good friends
for quite some time.

263
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:10,000
We've played poker together,
fist fought, run women together ...

264
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,900
Remember when we got thrown in jail
for breaking up that poker game?

265
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:21,800
And what we did in the fountain
in front of the jail?

266
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:28,000
Because of what we've been through,
I'll do something for you.

267
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:33,700
- I'll give you a great gift.
- You'll kill yourself for me?

268
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:41,100
Better than that.
We have a horse out there, a roan.

269
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,200
He's probably the best piece
of horse flesh in Arizona.

270
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:50,800
- That's a fact.
- I'm going to give him to you.

271
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:55,100
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Don't try.

272
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:00,400
We'll load the horse into
your truck, and you bring him home.

273
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,600
I won't forget this, Ben.

274
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,500
You think Bull can handle him?

275
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,600
If he can't, with all those kids,
he'll kill him and eat him.

276
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,300
Howdy, Ben.
Howdy, Howdy.

277
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,800
That's the second time
I've missed today.

278
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,700
- What do you think you're doing?
- Remember me? Harvey Williams.

279
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,800
- Ben asked you what you're doing.
- Gathering strays, same as you.

280
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,400
- With a gun?
- I just crease them. It's easier.

281
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,900
It beats
wearing out good horses.

282
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:15,300
- You saw us coming at that steer?
- As a matter of truth, I did.

283
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:20,500
- And you let go anyway.
- I figured I'd beat you to him.

284
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:26,100
I would have if I hadn't missed.
I guess I'm shooting low again.

285
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:35,200
That's a good-looking gun you have.
Mind if I take a look at it?

286
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,800
- You just crease them?
- It stuns them for a while.

287
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,900
- Like hunting wild horses.
- Same thing.

288
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:51,400
- Are you good at hunting horses?
- I'd say there's none better.

289
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,400
I'm glad about that.

290
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,800
Now go hunt your horses.

291
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:12,500
Are you leaving us afoot here?
It's ten miles back ...

292
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,700
It's ten miles back to camp!

293
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,000
Turn him loose.

294
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,700
- A good horse could save us time.
- Like that old roan?

295
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,700
- It's been quiet without him.
- I can stand it.

296
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:52,200
That iron is cold already.
It's the worst winter I ever saw.

297
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,200
I hope the other hands
stop the south roundup.

298
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:04,600
Nice easy horses ...
Pushing dry cows and fat bulls.

299
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:09,100
I bet they've been to Sedona
three or four times already.

300
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,100
If I ever get back,
I'll work in a filling station.

301
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:24,100
- Could you stand working inside?
- No. It's the damn Apache in me.

302
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,100
- Apache?
- Didn't I tell you I'm part Indian?

303
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,500
- Everybody says so.
- Those redskins get around.

304
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:32,700
- My grandfather's full-blood.
- What does that make you?

305
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:38,400
Enough to see a horse coming
from a mile away. Like that one.

306
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,100
- What do you suppose happened?
- I don't know.

307
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:13,900
But I know what is going to happen.
Come spring, I'll buy this animal.

308
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,600
Then I'll load him in that truck
and sell him to a soap factory.

309
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,000
I'll buy the first cake of soap
made out of him.

310
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,300
Then I'll wallow in a manure pile
for a week.

311
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:35,300
Then I'll take a bath. From then on,
I'll laugh whenever I wash my hands.

312
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,200
That's what I am going to do.

313
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,400
- I'll open the corral gate.
- If we shoot, they'll run.

314
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,400
The hell you say!

315
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:53,600
- How many head did they run off?
- 30, at least. Let's string him up!

316
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,500
I have a better idea.

317
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,300
Merry Christmas.

318
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,100
The same to you.

319
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:07,300
I bet all the others are in Sedona
having a big turkey dinner ...

320
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,300
Passing out presents,
having a fine time.

321
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,400
Most likely.

322
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:31,100
Howdy, Ben. Howdy, Howdy.
Merry Christmas.

323
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,800
Who says there is no Santa Claus?

324
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,600
Stay with it, Ben.

325
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:58,100
- Merry Christmas.
- Haven't changed a bit, have you?

326
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,000
Think you can just
dance a girl off her feet.

327
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,700
- Kiss her whenever you like.
- Are you mad?

328
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,700
I didn't say that.
How long are you two staying here?

329
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,600
- Until spring.
- Are you catching any strays?

330
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:20,600
- We have got a few.
- Why do you work for Jim Ed Love?

331
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:26,700
You could be top hand on any outfit.
Be anything you wanted to, in fact.

332
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,300
I know you playin' dumb,
but you're smart.

333
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,400
Why live out of a truck,
with only a rope and saddle?

334
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:42,900
- It's not such a bad way to live.
- If you ever want a home it is.

335
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,600
Now wait a minute.

336
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,900
A man has to get the
free and easy out of his system.

337
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:55,500
And when it is time to settle down,
he can really ... settle down.

338
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,900
If not he'll keep looking back,
thinking he missed something better.

339
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,800
- Someday you will get married?
- I figured to do that someday.

340
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,200
It might even be you, Meg.
A man could do a lot worse.

341
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:17,800
Could he? You're good with a horse,
but you don't know much about women.

342
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:30,000
That old roan kicked in the wall
and keeled over on the dance floor.

343
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,200
Vince ...
Where did you park your truck?

344
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,000
- Out by the corral.
- Any whiskey mash in it?

345
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:55,200
- Four bags.
- Is he dead?

346
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,500
He's drunk!

347
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,400
Ben, look.

348
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,400
I see him.

349
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:53,400
Rafe, get the horses you need.
Morning, boys.

350
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,000
- Did you have a good winter?
- It's good you came along.

351
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:02,700
We have only one rope left,
and we both want to hang ourselves.

352
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:07,800
Not with all the back wages
I have for you.

353
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
- How many strays did you find?
- 108.

354
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:15,300
- That's 108 times 6 ...
- 7!

355
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:22,300
- That comes to ...
- 756 dollars.

356
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,400
I'll take your word for that.
4, 5, 7, and 56.

357
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,300
And 140
for topping out that rough string.

358
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,800
You'll want to get to Sedona, -

359
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,300
- so my boys will drive the stock
back to the ranch.

360
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:42,400
What about the calf that was born
in the spring after the gather?

361
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:47,400
- What about him?
- You didn't bring him in.

362
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,500
- That wasn't part of the deal.
- We gathered their mamas.

363
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:56,200
That's not the same, but ...
How many?

364
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,800
Ten in all.

365
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:07,100
That's 60. No, 70 even.

366
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:17,300
- That does it.
- Yeah, that does it.

367
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,100
Jim Ed Love,
you're the cheapest man I ever met.

368
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,600
And if I never work for you again,
it will be too soon.

369
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:30,600
Now wait. I'm a reasonable man.
Let's make a trade.

370
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,800
- What kind of a trade?
- I keep the 70 for the calves.
You keep that old roan horse.

371
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,700
What do you say?

372
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:58,300
That suits me fine.

373
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,500
You've got yourself a deal.

374
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:43,000
- What's wrong, Ben?
- You see that sign?

375
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:48,500
- How many years have we done this?
- The past five years.

376
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:54,300
Work all winter, go into town,
spend our money and start all over.

377
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:00,300
- Going to work for Jim Ed Love.
- It won't happen this time.

378
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:06,900
I've been doing some thinking.
What if we go to the Wildcat Bar -

379
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,900
- just before rodeo, and say we have
a horse that can throw anybody?

380
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:17,200
- We'd start a fistfight.
- Sure. But we'd have a lot of bets.

381
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,600
- We could double our money on him.
- And then do you know what I'll do?

382
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,800
- Sell him to a soap factory?
- No, I've changed my mind.

383
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:36,500
I'll sell him to a dog food company,
buy the first can made out of him, -

384
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:41,100
- and then feed it
to the mangiest dog I can find.

385
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,700
That's what I'm going to do.

386
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:37,000
- Having trouble?
- It's the carburetor or something.

387
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,400
- Mind if we take a look?
- Would you?

388
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:46,400
We can't be out of gas.
We just had the tank filled.

389
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:53,000
- Howdy, get in and fire her up.
- It's awful nice of you to stop.

390
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,400
No trouble at all.
Hold it, Howdy.

391
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:16,400
Try it again.
Nope!

392
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,800
- It is the carburetor.
- Is that bad?

393
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,100
I'm afraid it is. That's too bad.
There's a garage four miles away.

394
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:31,900
We're headed in that direction.
We'd be glad to give you a lift.

395
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:39,100
- Are you sure it's no trouble?
- No trouble at all.

396
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,600
It will be just fine.

397
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:05,500
So I said to this ape, "If you think
my sister and I came to Las Vegas -

398
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:11,000
- to be B-girls in your lousy joint,
you got another thing coming."

399
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:17,800
Being exotic dancers is one thing,
but drinking with the guests, no.

400
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,600
We get along on talent.

401
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:25,400
We don't push thin whiskey
or roll drunks for a living.

402
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:30,400
- Not anymore.
- No, we have a regular act.

403
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:39,300
We have music written up for it.
Lights, props, everything.

404
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:48,000
The days of bumps and grinds
are gone. You must have a gimmick.

405
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:53,200
A stripper brought it back
from India or something.

406
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:59,100
- We call our act the Love Snakes.
- We get into two baskets.

407
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:04,400
When the curtain goes up,
the clarinet plays this weird music.

408
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:11,600
- And then we uncoil.
- We hiss and strike at each other.

409
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:17,200
And when we shed our skin,
it brings the house down.

410
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:24,500
I've got bad news, ladies.
I have to get parts in Sedona.

411
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:29,200
- How long will that take?
- Maybe all day.

412
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:34,900
- We can't leave until morning.
- I'm sorry, it's the best I can do.

413
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:39,800
I guess you're just stuck with us.

414
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,900
Let's get a bottle
and go for a moonlight swim.

415
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:50,300
- In the middle of the day?
- Time flies.

416
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:56,800
- What do you think?
- That suits me fine.

417
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:21,300
State Fish Hatchery

418
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
- The game warden!
- Let's get out of here.

419
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,300
- That was close. Come out, girls.
- They can't.

420
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:11,100
Look ...
And me without my clarinet.

421
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:36,600
Sedona Rodeo

422
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,500
We'll have you out of there
in a minute. Just wait here.

423
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:16,800
- Ben! When did you get back?
- Arlee, do me a favor.

424
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,900
See that booth over there?
Give me four ham and eggs.

425
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,500
And I'd like two aprons
like she has.

426
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:30,600
- What for?
- Just don't ask any questions.

427
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:37,500
These are the last two I've got.
How do you want the eggs?

428
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,900
- Cooked.
- Aprons?

429
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,000
Here, put these on.

430
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,300
How do we look?

431
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,800
I feel a draft.

432
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:21,000
When I say now,
jump in the booth, quick!

433
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:29,700
- We've done her.
- Arlee?

434
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:34,900
Run over to the store
and get these girls some dresses.

435
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,500
- What color do you want?
- Any color, just so it is pink.

436
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,100
Purple is fine.

437
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:49,300
- This booth has splinters.
- Will you keep the coffee warm?

438
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:54,900
- Where are you going?
- To see some men about a horse.

439
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:10,600
Hold it! I'll say it again. I'll bet
we have an old roping horse, -

440
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:16,100
- and no cowboy in this town
is cowboy enough to ride him.

441
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,000
Fight!

442
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:59,500
 Coming out of chute number one,
 Grady Decker on Upperhand.

443
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:15,300
Give him a big hand, folks.
That's all the pay he'll get.

444
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:47,200
Here's one for you.
The <Santa Rio> sails in two weeks.

445
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:52,400
It has a swimming pool,
shuffle board and promenade deck.

446
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,000
Stops at Hawaii and Tahiti.

447
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:02,300
And now a special event.
We have an old roan roping horse.

448
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:08,800
It can buck off any cowboy.
At least that's what it says here.

449
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,800
- It's coming out of chute two.
- What if he doesn't buck?

450
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:20,100
Suppose he walks out
like a milk-pen calf?

451
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:26,300
- He wouldn't do that.
- No? Just look.

452
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,200
Look at that bastard buck!

453
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,700
He's hurt, Howdy.

454
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:22,900
- What do you think, Doc?
- He thinks he's finished.

455
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:28,000
He doesn't think he can stand up.
He won't even try.

456
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:36,700
I'd throw in what we won,
if it would get him up again.

457
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:46,100
- We'll be back where we started.
- There's always next year.

458
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:53,000
If it's a question of money,
we have about 400 bucks.

459
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:58,900
- This roan isn't worth that much.
- He is to us.

460
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,200
I'm sorry, boys.
Nothing more can be done for him.

461
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,600
He'll have to be destroyed.

462
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:16,700
I'll see to it for you,
if you like.

463
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:24,200
No, I got him into this,
I'll get him out.

464
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:49,600
- Is there anything we can do?
- No.

465
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,200
Do you still have that .44 pistol?
Get it.

466
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:59,300
The morning sun makes them
forget the hurt they got.

467
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,600
Get it.

468
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:44,700
The son buck will be all right!

469
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:53,300
I'll kill that knot-head.
So help me, I'll kill him!

470
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,700
435, 455, 60 ...

471
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:05,400
475. That's it.

472
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:11,200
- I can't rebuild my stable on this.
- It's all we have.

473
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:15,500
It's not enough.
I need at least 200 more.

474
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:19,700
- But we don't have it.
- I do.

475
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,900
- How much was that again?
- 200.

476
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:29,900
- Say 200.
- Thank you, Mr. Love.

477
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:37,000
Tanner's hard to do business with.
Are you ready to go?

478
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:42,200
- Go where?
- I have a new string of broncos.

479
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:49,700
You'll be able to pay off the 200.
You might even stay the winter.

480
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:53,100
See you boys later.

481
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:12,900
Jim Ed isn't so bad. Never tells you
how to do your job.

482
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,000
We might have a chance to go against
some of Vince's wonderful stuff.

483
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:24,500
- Not to mention his daughters.
- Aggie's fine when it gets cold.

484
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:29,600
Howdy,
do you know what a bronc rider is?

485
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:38,900
He's a cowboy
with his brains kicked out.

486
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:44,000
It takes a hard man
to eat boiled owl.

487
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,400
Let's go.

488
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:50,600
Whatever suits you
suits me just fine.
