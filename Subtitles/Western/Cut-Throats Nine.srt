1
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:06,500
Many years have passed since my arrival in Golden Sands.

2
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,269
Lot of water under the bridge.

3
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:13,292
I remember leaving the mine looked like.

4
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,680
Four houses lost in a forgotten corner of the world.

5
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,176
I have no good memories of it, but one thing is certain.

6
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:27,560
I left there is an important part of myself behind. Buried.

7
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,860
I have often dreamed to leave the mine. I thought about it constantly.

8
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:26,752
Half an hour ago it was finally all over.

9
00:02:27,306 --> 00:02:30,120
We're all like rats in a trap.

10
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,240
Maybe we can escape

11
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:38,560
but I doubt if we survive the 400 miles to Fort Green.

12
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:20,093
Dick Patterson.

13
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:25,485
Enough crimes to remain forever chained.

14
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,370
The doctor means a month or six.

15
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:37,040
Joe Farrow.

16
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:42,090
El Comanchero.
Hard, bloeddorstig en ijskoud.

17
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,879
He began scalping of Indians, but also killed his brothers

18
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,040
and others of his race. Chained for life.

19
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,934
Smart, a snake. A backstabbing traitor.

20
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,220
Received a life sentence for murder.

21
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,280
Ray Brewster.

22
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:06,507
The torch. Arsonist. Thief and murderer. Lifelong.

23
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,219
Thomas Lawrence. Dandy Tom.

24
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,640
Gambler, swindler, forger. And natural killer.

25
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,680
Hard labor for life.

26
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,930
John Weasel McFarland.

27
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,120
Lifelong chained for robbery, rape and murder.

28
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,160
Has one redeeming feature: he's probably disturbed.

29
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,560
Dean Marlowe.

30
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,680
No one knows his crimes, he was sentenced to life and hard labor.

31
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,080
If you ever stop? I have high distress.

32
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:59,160
Put it in your pants.

33
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:14,480
Command executed, soldier.

34
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,640
Whatever happens, do not shoot.

35
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:59,000
Think about your life, Patterson?

36
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:04,680
Your whole life flashes before your eyes just before you die.

37
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,480
You said so yourself? - What do you know?

38
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,460
You never died. - The rope was around my neck.

39
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,960
I've seen those flashes. As dirty as life.

40
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,400
Just as dirty as your life, Patterson.

41
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,920
At the last moment they condemned me to this life.

42
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,440
Pure accident.

43
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,540
Right. And this is the worst.

44
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:36,160
Hello there, friends.

45
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,660
We've been waiting a long time.

46
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,620
Silent now. Not a peep.

47
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:51,000
Where you were doing? Did you all my emptied?

48
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,039
Do not worry, soldier.

49
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,080
You must understand, we are only interested in gold.

50
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,860
Give it to me and your men can go.

51
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,860
Then there's more to me. Still, family?

52
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,140
Do not shoot children. It's good people.

53
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,840
Not shoot the bastards, you hear me?

54
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:44,720
Get off.

55
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,180
Disarm.

56
00:07:58,898 --> 00:08:00,964
My youngest son.

57
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,160
Hands off, Dad.

58
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,580
You bring me in embarrassment. First check his teeth.

59
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,200
Sergeant.

60
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,860
Who are they? - Inmates from the mine.

61
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,280
I take them to Fort Green.

62
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,620
And the gold? - We have no gold, mate.

63
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,760
You rob us too often. - Fucking liar ...

64
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,960
Son, look for that gold. Heard?

65
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,760
Okay, dogs. Where is the gold?

66
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,600
Come here.

67
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,960
Where is it? - Look at this.

68
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,760
Nothing to find.

69
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:59,200
We have been waiting here for months. With famine and cold.

70
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,300
Do you know why? Because I was going to steal your gold.

71
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,500
Now listen well: Go back to the mine.

72
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:12,200
Let your boss send the gold if I make everyone down here.

73
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,240
And then I fire you camp flat.

74
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,280
Let them leave.

75
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:26,720
Bon voyage, friends. Good luck and God bless you.

76
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,220
We gotta get outta here. Those horses are unstoppable.

77
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,240
Chained?

78
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,360
Jump when I say it.

79
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:31,520
Forward.

80
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,160
Cathy. Is everything alright? - Yes.

81
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,820
Come on.

82
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,190
My leg. It's broken.

83
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,200
Look.

84
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,960
What gets it from, Sergeant? This one survives.

85
00:14:08,023 --> 00:14:12,490
The car was destroyed and Slim can not move.

86
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,600
Do us apart? - No, you go that way.

87
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:24,090
You also does not escape, Brown. I want to see you die soon.

88
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,339
Your daughter for you. - We need to Fort Green.

89
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,160
My orders are for the survivors.

90
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:34,360
Charge the stocks on the horses and make you ready.

91
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,940
Now. Forward. - And Slim?

92
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,280
We carry him in turn. - I have an idea, sergeant.

93
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,600
Forget it and do what you will dedicate. - And if I do not?

94
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,620
Then you get a bullet in your belly.

95
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,120
You're easy to separate the chain. - Just my idea.

96
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,300
Do it with Slim.

97
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,680
Make the car empty.

98
00:15:45,418 --> 00:15:49,260
I'm scared, Dad. We'll never make it.

99
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:35,000
Wait.

100
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,420
We spend the night here.

101
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,560
Dandy.

102
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,820
Will not you help me?

103
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,160
You can help us.

104
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,160
You just need to die.

105
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,680
Divide the stock.

106
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:39,560
It is for six days. - By then you'll burn.

107
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,560
Amen.

108
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,660
Who did it?

109
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:10,720
The truth, please. Who did it?

110
00:20:12,073 --> 00:20:15,920
He was still dying. Give the machete.

111
00:20:17,673 --> 00:20:22,080
Who did it? - He was a heavy burden. Needless.

112
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,080
And he continues.

113
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,880
We take the body it speaks to one of you.

114
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,640
Cover it and continue.

115
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,860
Her leg is broken, Dad.

116
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,520
Once hunted bears?

117
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:35,308
You tie a cub on his leg until he yells.

118
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,060
Papa bear hears and comes close.

119
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,240
And then you take him to graze.

120
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,340
Dean, you can catch a bear if you will. No problem.

121
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,420
She trusts you probably.

122
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,520
My hands are frozen.

123
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:04,640
I give half my life for a barrel of whiskey.

124
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:07,920
Then you do not have time to drink it.

125
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,680
That was our stock, sergeant. - I was told it was for six days.

126
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,080
How far you want to drive us? - Up to Fort Green.

127
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,660
Sta right.

128
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,280
Wait a second.

129
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:04,940
Go all but.

130
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,500
That mare does not reach it.

131
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,760
Forward. Up.

132
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,720
Come on.

133
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,220
Never come so close. Heard?

134
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,400
Cathy, can you ever forgive me?

135
00:25:54,401 --> 00:25:58,800
How so? There was no other way. We could not be separated.

136
00:25:58,801 --> 00:26:03,460
I feel responsible. You are the victim of my mistakes.

137
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,310
It's not your fault. There is so much happened.

138
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,879
I was never allowed to take from Golden Sands.

139
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,260
I was glad to be with you, Dad. - She begged me so often.

140
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,840
To leave, but I never listened.

141
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,280
You know her last birthday yet?

142
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,600
She laughed so hard she could not blow out the candles.

143
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,960
I only know that she died too young.

144
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,520
And one of them killed her.

145
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,880
Get him out.

146
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,720
Go ahead.

147
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,080
It was an accident. - One little spark and ...

148
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:29,520
It's just ashes, sergeant. One blow with the machete and it's over.

149
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,920
Or should we wear that mess?

150
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,440
De machete.

151
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,980
Cut it a try.

152
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,520
Gold. It is gold. - Shows.

153
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,400
It is gold.

154
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,280
Is that true?

155
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,560
Gold.

156
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,720
Enough.

157
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,460
It is a gold chain. You knew it.

158
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,440
The situation remains unchanged.

159
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:14,120
You knew. You're a dirty snake Brown.

160
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,119
You should not take us.

161
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,540
You just wanted that gold transport without being robbed.

162
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:27,080
That had us head can cost.

163
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,680
I tear you in pieces before this is over, Sergeant.

164
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,200
I swear.

165
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,240
We must go. - And if we do not want?

166
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,640
Then I'll go alone. - Without the gold?

167
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,520
No. I'll take it.

168
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,000
You and your daughter can not wear this. Not even two miles.

169
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,080
Now all you have needed us, huh? - You are mistaken.

170
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,960
I can tell you all buried there and later come back.

171
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,680
You do not do that. - Who can stop me?

172
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,480
You would like to, huh?

173
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,280
You took us from the mine to murder us.

174
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,960
You still think that any of us killed your wife.

175
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,320
Forward. - I will not take one foot.

176
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,520
Right.

177
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,340
Come on, I said.

178
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,520
Another one is deleted from your list, Sergeant.

179
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,400
I could not have been better.

180
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,480
That was not necessary. - Are you coming along?

181
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,680
I had to do it, Cathy. Otherwise, we'll never make Fort Green.

182
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,320
To retaliate, you have to murder four innocent men.

183
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,480
They deserve one at the gallows.

184
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,160
Hopefully you do not see what happens if they catch me.

185
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,780
I've seen which you are capable.

186
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,160
I have a mission and I'm going to accomplish. - Do not lie mainly.

187
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,960
Now I know why you did it. - Who do you defend?

188
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,640
Them all or one specific?

189
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,520
Them all. Or one specific.

190
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,520
They do not last much longer.

191
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,280
Be careful.

192
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,880
This is our chance.

193
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,720
Stay alert.

194
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,480
Did you hear me? Be careful.

195
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,040
Hey, look.

196
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,640
It's enough like this.

197
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:19,440
You're making it too easy to die.

198
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,440
I want him to die slowly.

199
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,400
Yes. Just like all of us.

200
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,240
Leave her alone. - You take it to them?

201
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,240
Leave her alone, I said.

202
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,260
It is his daughter.

203
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,740
No.

204
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,240
No.

205
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,480
Cursed necklace. We never get lost.

206
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,440
Until now brings us happiness.

207
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,520
You've had enough to drink. - Leave me alone.

208
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,360
Look at me, sergeant Brown.

209
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,240
One of us has killed your wife.

210
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,480
We're gonna take care of you. Be sure of that.

211
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,000
A man like you deserves a punishment.

212
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,680
Want to know who killed your wife?

213
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,520
You're dead and buried without you ever knowing.

214
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,759
Even if it's gold, I want to give half of that necklace for a piece of bread.

215
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,920
Soon you give everything away for it not to have to bear.

216
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,120
The girl. What's wrong with her?

217
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,440
She seems crazy.

218
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,680
Let her go anyway. - Calm down.

219
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,520
Let me see. We're sitting here.

220
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,480
En daar de Salmon River Mountains.
Vlak achter Fort Green.

221
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,500
Quite risky. We may encounter a patrol.

222
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,000
And on the other side? Lewiston direction.

223
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,240
That's way too far. We did not have the strength for such a distance.

224
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:14,800
Near the fort is a farm. We go there at night to go.

225
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,280
We do the chain off and get some horses and guns.

226
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,000
At sunrise we're out of there. - Are you crazy?

227
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,880
There always sit boozing soldiers.

228
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,960
Too bad for those soldiers.

229
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,400
I should kill you but.

230
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,560
But with that chain our lives depends on the others.

231
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,360
Bukken.

232
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:11,320
You've never shot from a distance. The length of the poker table.

233
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,960
I remember one time in San Francisco.

234
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:34,120
I went to a restaurant with white tablecloths.

235
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,720
It smelled there to roasted chicken.

236
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,280
I took duck with orange and trout with rum.

237
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,760
Shut up or I'll do it for you.

238
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,120
Save your strength. We have still some way to go.

239
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,920
I always filthy rich to die.

240
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:08,960
That will now succeed. - No worries. I will close your eyes.

241
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,360
And deliver you from the weight you are dragging.

242
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,000
Try to sleep, guys.

243
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,100
I have three bullets.

244
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,320
Do not waste your time on her.

245
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,500
One more time and you're dead.

246
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:15,040
Stop. Let it be. - That dead weight we leave behind.

247
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:19,239
Yes, let her here. She has no use anymore.

248
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,120
I give the orders. - Since when?

249
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,180
That gun gives him the advantage.

250
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,999
Hou op.

251
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,800
You want to murder each other. Stop.

252
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,320
I'll kill you ...

253
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,880
Did you hear me?

254
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,480
Quit it. Are you nuts?

255
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,040
Keep your wits, you idiot. Or we all die.

256
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:17,990
If I get the chance, I kill him. He Weasel nevertheless caught?

257
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,320
There should be a railway. I think we're as lost as anything.

258
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:57,640
We have been going for a few hours in circles. - This is the only way.

259
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,920
If we do not die first, we arrive tomorrow.

260
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,440
How often does the train passes here? - Do not worry.

261
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,760
Surely more than once.

262
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,640
I can not make it.

263
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,600
The track there.

264
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,480
We must reach the tunnel for the train is passing.

265
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:53,640
I took the train when I was a free man.

266
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:58,600
Good idea. Soon we'll all be free.

267
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,520
If they see us, they stop the train. - No worries.

268
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,480
In that dark tunnel, no one sees us.

269
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:10,560
We will be separated. We will never be completely free.

270
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:14,460
I'm That plan. We go to the farm and that's it.

271
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:20,840
That gold suffocates us. We will always feel slave.

272
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,960
A rich slave.

273
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,580
There it will change, I think.

274
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,920
Wait here for us.

275
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:43,744
Hopefully the chain does not stick, then we will be swept away.

276
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,640
Free.

277
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,440
See the lovebirds once.

278
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:05,440
He never gets rid of her. - Until I pull his throat.

279
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,200
Cathy, we're all the same?

280
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,640
Why do you ask that?

281
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,960
Ray asked why you were following us.

282
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,960
For me, I thought.

283
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,680
I do not know why. Maybe for you.

284
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,840
Or because I hate the others.

285
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,640
Sometimes I think I can die better.

286
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,560
I am confused.

287
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,200
In moe.

288
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,600
That will change soon. It's almost over.

289
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,160
When it's over for you?

290
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,120
I am not sure.

291
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,990
That gold cost us nearly our lives.

292
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:07,600
But now it will take care of us. - I thought you were different, Dean.

293
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,020
That was me.

294
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,120
I was wrongly convicted for a robbery.

295
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:19,080
That gold is mine. I paid for it.

296
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,860
With my freedom.

297
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:31,440
That farm. How far is it? - Three days, when he's not working against us.

298
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,280
I think we should stay away from Fort Green.

299
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,200
Asked your opinion?

300
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,760
You remain best in us, Ray. Otherwise you will not survive it.

301
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,040
Shame to lose that gold.

302
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,400
Dirty rat.

303
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,480
He ran with our stock.

304
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,980
We have to catch him. - That never succeed.

305
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,560
He escaped while we were sleeping.

306
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:46,160
We better go on. - Without food?

307
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,080
That we will not. - Wait.

308
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,920
That prisoner was bitten. - He is crazy.

309
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:34,280
Gold, Dad. The sergeant was right. They had us nice bite.

310
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,800
Give me that.

311
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,320
No one takes me bite.

312
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,400
Sta right.

313
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,920
Boy, when I saw you in that car, my heart bled.

314
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,320
Where are your friends?

315
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,990
Answer.

316
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,560
If you treat a husband, son.

317
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,440
Tell me.

318
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,600
They are on the farm at Fort Green.

319
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:29,340
You're lying. There are soldiers. Why would they go there?

320
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:35,120
They need a car. And take off their chains.

321
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:40,360
You are lucky. You do not have to go that far.

322
01:09:40,361 --> 01:09:43,360
Dad, can I kill him?

323
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,640
No.

324
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,990
Not until we know if he's telling the truth.

325
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,920
What would happen on that farm?

326
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,120
Dean can try to murder us, like Weasel.

327
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,440
Maybe. - Do I get him first.

328
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,800
If we kill each other for the gold.

329
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:15,160
Or we can use our minds and help each other to survive.

330
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:20,200
Yes. Whether we find something where nobody is looking.

331
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,480
Life is full of surprises.

332
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,200
Come sit by the fire.

333
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,000
We've all been through a lot.

334
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:49,620
Like it or not, life is the only thing we have left.

335
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,940
That is not much.

336
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,480
This morning I saw what you had planned.

337
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,080
You are mistaken.

338
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:04,360
I'll wait until you all die. - Do not say that.

339
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:11,160
You know how I feel. - You've done a lot, Dean.

340
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,640
But lying to yourself nothing. You saw in me a chance to escape.

341
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,440
Yes. In the beginning, though.

342
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,460
Now it's too late for all of us.

343
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,919
Come on, guys. We need to Fort Green.

344
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:36,040
So we will never get there.

345
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,480
Get out, you.

346
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:03,680
Faster, Dad. We have to tackle before they reach the farm.

347
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:07,120
We must not overload the horses.

348
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,200
There it is.

349
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:27,680
We wait until it's dark. - Will Calwell recognize us?

350
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,320
Your mother did not even recognize you.

351
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,240
Goeieavond.

352
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,160
A bottle of whiskey. - Cost you two dollars.

353
01:15:00,161 --> 01:15:02,520
I did not ask.

354
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,400
Are you still playing with?

355
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:12,200
Calm, Calwell. We pay for everything.

356
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,080
Where do I know you from? - We have another long talk.

357
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:21,240
Long ago. Do not you remember?

358
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:30,200
Do you have what to eat? - No, it's too late.

359
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:34,760
Are you sure? Go and see.

360
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,480
Heb je geld?

361
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,800
Calwell wants to see you.

362
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,120
Is this enough?

363
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:16,040
Look closer. It is gold.

364
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:29,440
It is indeed gold, George. Pure gold.

365
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,880
Enough to pay for everything?

366
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,880
Another bottle. - Where did you get that?

367
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,560
None of your business. Calwell.

368
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,519
We want a strong car and six horses.

369
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:55,526
In exchange for a piece of this chain.

370
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:58,480
You do this?

371
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:03,120
You go to Fort Green.

372
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,200
And you're going to answer some questions.

373
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:11,320
Why, sergeant? We've been there.

374
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,040
It's a rotten cesspool.

375
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:31,680
Come on, Sergeant. Do not make it complicated.

376
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,500
Have a cigar.

377
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,960
My friend had no bottle to ask?

378
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,279
Do you have a car, Calwell? - No.

379
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:15,960
You're lying. - I swear. See for yourself.

380
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,840
Did you hear that?

381
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,160
Then we have to stay here.

382
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:27,740
Tomorrow morning, the car of Fort Green to store stock.

383
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,800
Nevertheless, Calwell?

384
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,440
Come on guys, drink with us.

385
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:42,920
Sergeant? - Yes please.

386
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:14,440
It's true. The stall is empty.

387
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,640
Then we wait.

388
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,800
Another two hours before sunrise.

389
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,040
Enough.

390
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:40,520
And the soldiers? - Take them out of the way.

391
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,400
What else can we do?

392
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,440
As we cross the border will follow the army.

393
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,320
Bind ze vast in de stallen.

394
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,320
If they find them, we are all on the other side.

395
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,960
Okay soldiers, time for a nap.

396
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,240
There is still time.

397
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:09,960
The party starts but beware. - Did you hear me?

398
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,320
Get out.

399
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,960
Forward.

400
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,600
Okay, I'm going.

401
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,120
Hurry up.

402
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:43,420
A toast? Our impending separation.

403
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,160
What are your plans?

404
01:21:57,688 --> 01:22:00,200
Honestly, no idea.

405
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:04,200
Is she with you? - Yes.

406
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,160
You are mistaken.

407
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,620
None of your business.

408
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:50,040
You are attaching forget Calwell. We still have to count a lot.

409
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,960
Three years ago I ordered a bottle of gin here.

410
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,840
I put five dollars on the bar.

411
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,160
Let it rest.

412
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:11,240
I am bored. I can still talk with an old friend?

413
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,560
We're friends?

414
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,920
Nevertheless, Calwell? - What are you talking about?

415
01:23:21,921 --> 01:23:26,080
You brought me to Fort Green. Do you remember?

416
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,159
You got five dollars and gave me a gin, friend.

417
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:35,960
Because I went to prison, I did not need it anyway.

418
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,080
Now I leveled five dollars.

419
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,280
Sergeant. Waking.

420
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:58,360
You should inform immediately Fort Green. Hurry up. There is no time.

421
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,220
Hurry up.

422
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,740
She tried to free the soldiers.

423
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,880
No.

424
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,320
They are there. Get ready.
