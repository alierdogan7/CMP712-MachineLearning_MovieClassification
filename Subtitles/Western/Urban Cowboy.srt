I was so proud of you, Bud.
You looked so great up on that bull.

- Go ahead.

He sure does look familiar.

372
00:34:13,346 --> 00:34:17,016

- I don't know. I never seen him before.

He's turnin' it up.

the trailer was clean, flowers around?

- Yep.
- I didn't do that.

1280
02:05:50,509 --> 02:05:52,803
Sissy did it. She was there.

1281

She left you a note
asking you to phone her.

1282
02:05:55,348 --> 02:05:58,976
But I tore it up
cos I was sort of jealous.

1283
02:05:59,894 --> 02:06:02,396
I wanted to keep my cowboy.

1284
