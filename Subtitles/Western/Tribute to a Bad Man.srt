00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,903
Hey, this is what is called
get on time.

21
00:03:25,495 --> 00:03:26,973
Only you should not appear when shots
...

22
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:28,801
...
until you know who is who.

23
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:30,609
I do not know yet.

24
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:33,298
I am Jeremy Rodock.

25
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:35,183
That does not tell me anything.

26
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,134
The owner of these lands and
containing horses.

27
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:40,366
Was returning to my house from Cheyenne,...

28
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,956
... When I saw a couple of horse thieves
.

29
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,291
And I've just taken a bullet in the back
.

30
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,450
Come on, give me a hand.

31
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,140
We have to go after them.

32
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:51,766
With a horse for two
and you half dead?

33
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,098
Live Leave a vulture,
and eat you to the bone.

34
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,218
Left arm off me, do not touch
left arm.

35
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:06,938
Help me to ride.

36
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:09,430
Yes, and I'll take you home.

37
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:10,346
And nothing else there.

38
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:15,362
Have too glib to how young you are.

39
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:25,578
Head to Big Spring.

40
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:27,222
Do not know where he is.

41
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:30,396
Where are you, boy?

42
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:31,857
From Pennsylvania.

43
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:33,482
? Pennsylvania?

44
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:35,799
And your parents
know how far you are from home?

45
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,473
Hey, mister,
'm willing to help...

46
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:40,227
... but I have to put up with insults.

47
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:42,510
Right.

48
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,104
Head west,
and now I think it insults.

49
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:54,544
<i>... With horses, women and whiskey </ i>

50
00:04:54,866 --> 00:05:00,441
<i> There is nothing better than life </ i>

51
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:02,767
What's your name, boy?

52
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:03,915
Steve Miller.

53
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:05,924
Where are you from?

54
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,858
I've already said, my friend.

55
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:11,308
I have to be grateful, but do not spoil
.

56
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,409
What have you come here?

57
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:17,234
I'm looking for work.

58
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:18,794
What work?

59
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:21,196
In my village,
worked in the store.

60
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:22,592
In Store.

61
00:05:22,995 --> 00:05:24,277
Do you understand anything about horses?

62
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:25,470
Not much.

63
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:26,841
But I learn quickly.

64
00:05:26,924 --> 00:05:28,531
If not, do not tell me.

65
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:30,626
The first lesson is this:

66
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:34,156
The horse is the slave of man,
but treat him as a slave...

67
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:36,079
... and thou shalt be a man.
Do you remember?

68
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:36,968
Yes, sir.

69
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:40,027
Why not kill those rustlers
?

70
00:05:40,677 --> 00:05:42,780
I have just killed a squirrel in my life.

71
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:47,279
Wait till I tell
rescue a shopkeeper.

72
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:53,524
<i> Love in the light of the moon </ i>

73
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:56,023
Rodock Lord! Rodock Lord!

74
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:02,684
- Is not that razor ready, boy?
- Yet.

75
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,523
'll Be dead in 24 hours...

76
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:07,815
... as I do not bring this lead body
.

77
00:06:09,392 --> 00:06:10,915
And I still do not want to die.

78
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,257
I still have to spend many good times.

79
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:19,924
Not hurt much, fear not.

80
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:22,977
To me, of course not, but
...

81
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:25,076
Not want to leave...  invalid.

82
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:27,083
've Never done this...

83
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:28,127
... before.

84
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:31,149
Ever, have you taken
the heart of an apple?

85
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:32,747
Yes

86
00:06:33,077 --> 00:06:36,168
Forward then.
I am the apple.

87
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:43,740
<i>... Oh, how beautiful life </ i>

88
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:48,277
<i> How beautiful life </ i>

00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:53,990
<i> Good whiskey, horses, and
a woman for evenings... </ i>

<i>... I find myself alone... </ i>

91
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:17,857
How do you feel, son?

92
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:23,477
'm... I'm... fine.

93
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:27,653
Hey, do not go faint
above me, piece of chicken.

94
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:34,200
I'm all right.

95
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:44,495
Rodock Lord!

96
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,213
Rodock Lord, please.

97
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:49,665
Someone is coming.

98
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,266
Depart from fire, boy.

99
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:55,063
Fire Depart.

100
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:03,770
Is Waity.

101
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:07,970
Download it.

102
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:12,457
Indians? ?

103
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:16,257
No.
There are no Indians in these parts.

104
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,270
I've never seen a dead
far.

105
00:08:30,072 --> 00:08:31,381
Was a good man.

106
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:33,963
Y was very fond of horses.

107
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:39,528
Have been the same who attacked me.

108
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:45,565
Do guard an hour, and then I will relieve you
.

109
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:49,841
As day is done, we will go
to find his murderer.

110
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,908
<i>
We spent half a day searching for the two men... </ i>

111
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:54,974
<i>... they killed Waity </ i>

112
00:08:55,377 --> 00:08:57,589
<i> But we lost their tracks
near Valle de La Mare </ i>

113
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,950
Recreate sight, boy.

114
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:03,000
All horses are Rodock.

115
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:07,508
Look closely at the foals.

116
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,906
Soon they were weaned,
and I will never be...

117
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,443
... not so pretty nor so natural.

118
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:16,424
In a few years they will be ready for dressage...

119
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:17,943
... like that group there.

120
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,770
Started twenty years ago, an Indian
mare and a horse cock.

121
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:25,086
I raised them, fed them, sold them.

122
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:26,632
I did everything but breastfeeding.

123
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:28,841
And now I can not tell that I have.

124
00:09:31,723 --> 00:09:34,587
I had a partner once.
But that's another story.

125
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:36,543
Now is mine until the band.

126
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:39,434
And when they leave,
take something from me.

127
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:56,911
Baldy, Abe.

128
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,284
Rodock Lord,
Waity that's the horse?

129
00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:02,047
Le killed.
Lack a horse?

130
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,529
- We have not counted.
- Then count them.

131
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,987
Repasad all groups, including the one in
Dressage in the Valley.

132
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:09,052
- What do you expect?
- Well, sir.

133
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,033
Hey, Jumpy, is Mac?

134
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:25,658
In the barracks, sir Rodock.

135
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:29,515
- Tom, tell him I want to McNulty.
- Yes, boss.

136
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:33,165
Hey Mac, the boss calls you.

137
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,356
What have you been doing in Cheyenne,
fight a puma?

138
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:47,977
Not precisely a cougar.

139
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:50,159
I do not like to shave
in broad daylight.

140
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:51,822
What kind of foreman are you?

141
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:55,053
One who is not willing to put
that give lessons constantly.

142
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,624
Why are you still here?

143
00:10:56,785 --> 00:10:58,901
For $ 40 a month,
and food.

144
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:02,735
You know, do I have
still unclear, McNulty.

145
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:05,097
Das
the impression of someone with many ideas,...

146
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:08,484
... all lackluster.
And no honorable.

147
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:09,441
Yes, eh?

148
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:14,344
Cooky!

149
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:16,536
Jo!

150
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,066
Where you going?

151
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:53,273
Mr. Rodock says there is work for you...

152
00:11:53,308 --> 00:11:54,243
... if you want to stay.

153
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:01,097
All right? ? Do you want to??

154
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:04,920
Yes .. yes, of course I want
.

155
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:07,036
Hungry, right?

156
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:08,827
I have not eaten for two days.

157
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:11,973
Come with me.

158
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:17,380
Sit there.

159
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:24,001
Why do you look like?

160
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:26,412
Do you find it strange,
there is a woman here?

161
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:29,276
I Speak in a fun way? Is that
?

162
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:30,945
No,... eh...

163
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:33,790
'm working hard to learn to speak your language.

164
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:35,558
And I can write very well.

165
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:38,112
And accent.

166
00:12:39,995 --> 00:12:41,719
Mr. Rodock told me you're from...

167
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:43,771
... how you say, Pen... Pen...

168
00:12:43,853 --> 00:12:46,783
- Pennsylvania?.
- Ah, yes. Pennsylvania.

169
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:50,215
not you distinguish a wild horse a bath.

170
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,271
No, ma'am. But
I learn very quickly.

171
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:55,357
So much interest you have for staying?

172
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:57,236
I would love to be a cowboy.

173
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,278
Over here we call them cowboys.

174
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:01,326
Says he saved lives.

175
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:03,562
Yes Is it luck,
and arrived on time.

176
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:06,013
And he greatly admired,
how did you take the bullet.

177
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:08,096
It was so difficult, madame.

178
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:11,870
And you had so much fear,
I almost faint.

179
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:17,971
Mira. Since you're going to work here,
hope not lie to me.

180
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:19,738
Y eat.

181
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,383
I have offended, right?

182
00:13:26,796 --> 00:13:28,295
No, does not matter.

183
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:30,902
How is
a boy like you...

184
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:33,230
...  leaves town,
and leave everything you have,...

185
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,804
... To be a cowboy?

186
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,912
If you think
is a nice work, you're wrong.

187
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:40,408
First, lady, why not have him
explanations.

188
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:42,359
And secondly,
'm no kid.

189
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:47,297
Umm. I thought it smelled
hot coffee.

190
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:48,562
I love hot coffee.

191
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:50,595
Maybe in the bunkhouse,
not here.

192
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:52,029
It is better here.

193
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,123
McNulty, Steve Miller.

194
00:13:58,524 --> 00:13:59,327
Hi there.

195
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,889
- The boss is asleep?
- Why?

196
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,478
Baldy and Abe have arrived.

197
00:14:03,994 --> 00:14:06,151
The East sector is empty.
They stole all the horses.

198
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,439
Did you say,
or should I?

199
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:11,579
I'll tell you.

200
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:13,923
Uh, I'd like to see his face.

201
00:14:14,627 --> 00:14:17,074
It is a spectacle
when fever comes hanged.

202
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:18,116
Jo!

203
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:20,215
The bull.

204
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:23,025
Where are you, Steve?

205
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:26,339
Oh, very far.

206
00:14:26,374 --> 00:14:28,082
Yes, you have
cowboy look.

207
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,850
I'm not, but I have to eat
.

208
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:33,438
That makes you a partner
Senior club world.

209
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:35,790
But really,
does not matter much.

210
00:14:35,946 --> 00:14:37,387
There you go, for example,
a Rodock.

211
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:39,293
Is a very rich man,...

212
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:41,655
...
do you think that makes me admire him more?

213
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:43,013
No.

214
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:45,876
not have those horses that is smarter,...

215
00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:47,735
... but because they came here before.

216
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:50,012
What is hanged fever,
Mr. McNulty?

217
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:52,994
Hanged men, however
thieves they are,...

218
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,520
... without trial or jury.

219
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:56,777
Illness...

220
00:14:58,113 --> 00:14:59,427
... Can be deadly.

221
00:15:06,252 --> 00:15:08,717
That kid, do not you know how to eat alone?
Two weeks ago no see.

222
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:12,027
Take that cigarette out of the mouth.

223
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:14,501
You do not play the piano in a dump
seedy.

224
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:19,511
The first time you saw me I was smoking
.

225
00:15:19,546 --> 00:15:22,733
In a seedy dump.
You said you loved.

226
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:25,219
You said you made me very sexy.

227
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,728
Would you change now?

228
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:31,279
No.

229
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,230
I like sexy.

230
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:40,046
Yes, I said.

231
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:44,330
You also want to change.

232
00:15:47,161 --> 00:15:48,359
No.

233
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:51,451
- I'm going.
- Stay a little while.

234
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:52,398
Good night.

235
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:54,763
Bring me another bottle.
I'm not sleeping yet.

236
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:57,171
- But does not your back hurt?
- Yes, of course.

237
00:15:57,648 --> 00:15:59,025
But only when I sleep.

238
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:00,291
Bring me another bottle.

239
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:09,952
You learn with experience.
I will give you a hand.

240
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:12,489
Did he say if you want to do something?

241
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,116
- Have you finished?
- Yes, ma'am.

242
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:16,274
Please take the dishes to the well and friégalos
.

243
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,125
Clear.

244
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:25,929
I have not told him the horses.

245
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,806
Do not think I can say it tomorrow?

246
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:32,018
Are you afraid when you miss
ready to hang people?

247
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,252
How much will you be able to endure?

248
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:39,758
Do not touch me.

249
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:43,801
Me mistress of yourself would be.
You'd have what you want.

250
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,367
You did not want me
Cheyenne case.

251
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:47,213
Mac, you do not do more than
get into trouble.

252
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:48,278
Is seen not understand.

253
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,133
Not going to marry you, you do not want
.

254
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:52,643
- Go away, go away from here.
- What do you make of all this?

255
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,498
- Why are you still here?
- Because I want to be here.

256
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:57,653
When I was alone and sick and needed shelter
...

257
00:16:57,688 --> 00:17:00,602
... I said I could live here without getting
conditions.

258
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:02,216
Was free, and I still am.

259
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,756
Thanks for the coffee.

260
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:10,848
Jo!

261
00:17:11,002 --> 00:17:11,985
And that bottle
were bringing me to ca...?

262
00:17:11,986 --> 00:17:13,949
A moment Jeremy,
back to bed.

263
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,058
Has returned  Baldy?

264
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,068
No, it has not yet come.

265
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,282
Then
what are you doing here?

266
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:23,431
I came to take a cup of coffee.

267
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:28,261
Hey. You're new here,
and maybe you do not.

268
00:17:29,455 --> 00:17:32,076
There is a boiling coffee all night in the hut.

269
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:33,304
? Equally good?

270
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:36,240
Equally  good,
and more abundant.

271
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:38,462
Well, I'll keep this.

272
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,695
Good night.

273
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:48,164
Uh, be my friend, my impatient friend
.

274
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:51,345
Did you know him in Cheyenne?

275
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:53,755
My friend, what are
these questions?

276
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:56,865
Yes, let's leave.

277
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:58,567
No you were born the day I met you.

278
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,548
And, really, am I glad
.

279
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,388
- All right, Steve?
- Good.

280
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,064
- Have you eaten enough?
- Yes

281
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:10,877
Do not you have been taught to say thank you
?

282
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,023
Sure was a schoolteacher.

283
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:14,978
I have not walked the
school in my life.

284
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,827
But my father was a teacher.
And I was his best student.

285
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:21,185
French, German, Latin knew,
and a little English...

286
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:22,790
... when I was 16.

287
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:25,529
Good night, Steve.

288
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,953
Goodnight,
and thank you, ma'am.

289
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:29,705
Dislike Call lady.

290
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,487
Is hard to please,
Mrs. Rodock.

291
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:36,604
Neither my name as well.
'm Jocasta Constantine.

292
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:38,842
Miss Constantine.
I am Greek.

293
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,216
But you can call me Jo.

294
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,457
Right, Jo.

295
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,281
Steve.

296
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:49,087
If you need help or...

297
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,380
... well,...

298
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:52,518
... anyone steal you
your ingenuity.

299
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:21,952
A man, who had to cut trees
a mile...

300
00:19:21,987 --> 00:19:25,217
... to bring this piano,
should not clash at this point.

301
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,474
Toca you, Jo.

302
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,280
No, it's late and you're tired.

303
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:33,546
Come on, Jo, I know good
plays a little.

304
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:15,214
You were playing and singing this
the first time I saw you.

305
00:20:16,118 --> 00:20:18,269
You did not see me  me.
I I saw you.

306
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:21,978
This sounds better.

307
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,437
Ah! I forgot.
I have a gift for you.

308
00:20:27,273 --> 00:20:31,232
See. Reach out.

309
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:35,885
Jeremy!

310
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,643
I love.

311
00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:43,595
- Are beautiful.
- I can.

312
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,101
I had to pay two mares and a stallion
for them.

313
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:50,627
Do not have to buy anything anymore.

314
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:52,756
Why I will not be able to buy things
.

315
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:56,011
Not need gifts, Jeremy.

316
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,775
I will stay here whenever you want to have me.

317
00:21:00,588 --> 00:21:03,113
- Say that again.
- Whenever you want to have me.

318
00:21:05,114 --> 00:21:06,486
I like to hear you say.

319
00:21:06,826 --> 00:21:08,668
Although I know it will be a day when this...

320
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:11,657
... will stay small for you, and...

321
00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:14,693
... and want to leave.

322
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:17,468
I will not leave.

323
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,007
Hey, boy!

324
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:06,662
Not have, by chance, one of those
mail order catalogs.

325
00:22:07,114 --> 00:22:08,228
No, I have not.

326
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:11,477
I told a friend that this year brought
photos...

327
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,366
... women in corset.

328
00:22:13,714 --> 00:22:15,659
Fat, you are still ideas.

329
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:18,266
And so,
you never get anywhere.

330
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:21,018
I have not seen a woman besides
Jocasta, in 8 months.

331
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:22,854
And you're uglier every day.

332
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:29,708
Why do not you shut
while she plays the piano?

333
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:34,503
Hey, you're not going to take your shirt
.

334
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:35,622
Yes, why?

335
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:39,515
Because this is home, sweet home
, of the Texas doves.

336
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:40,978
Texan? Doves?

337
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:42,535
Pulgas.

338
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:02,343
Corsets...!

339
00:23:03,506 --> 00:23:05,423
So no one gets rich.

340
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:07,409
Al cot!

341
00:23:20,611 --> 00:23:22,854
Breakfast! Breakfast!

342
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:25,122
Breakfast !

343
00:23:26,784 --> 00:23:28,452
Breakfast!

344
00:23:38,588 --> 00:23:40,934
Eh, Steve! Here's to fly
call when eating.

345
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:42,984
- Breakfast not wait.
- And neither do we.

346
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:51,296
Good morning, Jo.

347
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:53,148
- Would you say?
- Yes

348
00:23:54,205 --> 00:23:55,409
Y was furious.

349
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,856
Now, there is no way to stop him
.

350
00:24:00,303 --> 00:24:01,416
I'm leaving now.

351
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:07,644
To be back in a day or two.

352
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:11,443
Oh, come on, come on.

353
00:24:11,803 --> 00:24:14,267
- Looks like you have stepped on a mule.
- Do not worry.

354
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:16,287
But you yes that's wrong.

355
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:18,364
Jeremy, please
do not go.

356
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,292
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

357
00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:23,634
Mean anything to you that I will pray
?

358
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:28,361
Jo. You know you're
for me?

359
00:24:28,688 --> 00:24:30,947
The person I care
more than anyone in the world.

360
00:24:31,634 --> 00:24:33,880
But I can not do what you ask.

361
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:36,929
We live in the middle
of nowhere.

362
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:40,259
Hundreds of miles of a civilized place...

363
00:24:40,616 --> 00:24:42,455
... where the only law is mine.

364
00:24:42,824 --> 00:24:45,158
Since I came here,
this to you I said,...

365
00:24:46,045 --> 00:24:50,952
... robbed me, harassed, attacked and persecuted
everywhere.

366
00:24:51,465 --> 00:24:54,233
Now
have killed one of my men.

367
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:57,476
If I find my horses,
I find the murderer.

368
00:24:57,695 --> 00:24:59,424
And if I find the murderer,
choked him.

369
00:24:59,788 --> 00:25:01,634
I have to fulfill my own law, Jo.

370
00:25:01,988 --> 00:25:05,182
A law that has allowed me to be
owns half of the horses of the West.

371
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:09,233
Goodbye, Jo.

372
00:25:09,252 --> 00:25:11,744
If you saw the damage that
that makes you, Jeremy.

373
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:14,943
You other.
You are sick.

374
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,243
You get the fever hanging.

375
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:25,431
Where you heard it rush
on the gallows?

376
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:27,814
Here  I took a few days...

377
00:25:27,849 --> 00:25:29,722
... when you took a horse thief and ahorcaste
.

378
00:25:29,806 --> 00:25:33,141
- I had stolen ten horses.
- And what served you hang him!

379
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:36,237
He died, something died in
and you!

380
00:25:36,352 --> 00:25:39,076
- You are not the law!
- I'm the only law that I have!

381
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:45,335
So, if you think this is not for you
...

382
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:51,004
... I lived alone a long time, Jo.

383
00:26:14,117 --> 00:26:17,428
<i> Find traces of that
Waity and we killed them all day </ i>

384
00:26:18,316 --> 00:26:20,692
<i> Mr. Rodock not
away view of footprints </ i>.

385
00:26:20,861 --> 00:26:22,245
<i> we never would stop </ i>

386
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:24,661
<i>
left to rest the horses </ i>

387
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:28,412
<i> Even when the wind rose and
erased footprints,... </ i>

388
00:26:28,447 --> 00:26:29,803
<i>  Give up... </ i>

389
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:31,412
<i> Went ahead </ i>

390
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:32,857
<i> Always ahead </ i>

391
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,242
I can not see anything .

392
00:26:34,353 --> 00:26:36,198
No never find them.

393
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:38,436
We will continue.

394
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,542
I tell you when I return.

395
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:51,120
What, do you see anything?

396
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:53,669
Hence not spend.

397
00:26:56,536 --> 00:26:58,166
We have to go to a
last.

398
00:26:58,678 --> 00:27:00,373
I will pay $ 10 each.

399
00:27:00,374 --> 00:27:01,587
What is this place?

400
00:27:02,141 --> 00:27:03,664
Peterson Ranch,
my former partner.

401
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,696
We will
warmly.

402
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,007
I do not have much affection.

403
00:27:35,365 --> 00:27:37,274
You know you're not well received
.

404
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:40,279
I have stolen some horses.

405
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,547
Rodock,
why do not you leave?

406
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:44,439
Whenever thieves looking and not find, pagers here.

407
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,880
Do not you get tired this game?

408
00:27:49,965 --> 00:27:51,451
Sal  my land!

409
00:27:52,612 --> 00:27:54,439
You heard my father,
out!

410
00:27:58,308 --> 00:27:59,431
Look, kid.

411
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:02,108
I taught
distinguish between the ass and the head of a horse.

412
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:04,836
I picked you up when you threw, you wiped the tears
...

413
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:06,451
... and sounded like snot.

414
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:07,938
Do not get the little man now!

415
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:09,565
Why have you come here?

416
00:28:10,777 --> 00:28:12,255
Because
my horses were here last time.

417
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,107
No, what was here
was my father.

418
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,041
Rodock, please!

419
00:28:15,052 --> 00:28:16,926
Now you have been led to believe this hoax,
right?

420
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:19,097
That I stole what belonged
.

421
00:28:19,338 --> 00:28:23,106
Well, you lied then.
And you lying now.

422
00:28:23,107 --> 00:28:25,586
- Rodock, go away!
- Rodock, if you do not I'll kill you.

423
00:28:25,968 --> 00:28:28,725
Do not kill me .
Left guts to do it.

424
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,551
I am very tired, Peterson.

425
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:33,449
Very tired and very angry.

426
00:28:33,957 --> 00:28:35,982
If you know anything about my horses tell me
.

427
00:28:36,265 --> 00:28:38,538
And I'll take and I'll forget,
like last time.

428
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:41,485
But if you do not tell me,
and has won...

429
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:43,921
... you will hang as
have proof.

430
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:48,467
They killed one of my men.

431
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,138
It's not about a horse.

432
00:28:53,152 --> 00:28:54,876
Rodock, last...

433
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:57,789
... do not come back.

434
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,063
Did not tell me that a man died.

435
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:13,258
I did not kill him.

436
00:29:13,782 --> 00:29:15,243
No, ma'am, it was not him.

437
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:18,713
I killed him.
And I feel it was not Rodock.

438
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,923
You start with one.
Then another.

439
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:25,582
Then these men came.

440
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,379
Now murder.

441
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:29,225
He has not killed anyone.

442
00:29:30,283 --> 00:29:32,012
You no longer needed here.

443
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:35,558
Continue here until we get on the horses
Utah.

444
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:37,717
Yes, when Rodock
has calmed down a bit.

445
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:40,185
Dad, you said that you found
.

446
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:43,124
Said they were wild horses.

447
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,057
See, Lars, I...

448
00:30:00,607 --> 00:30:01,838
Jo!

449
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,873
Cooky!

450
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,247
Jo!

451
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:31,257
Where is Jo?
Have you gone?

452
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:34,750
No, is in the barn, the mare has given birth
.

453
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,620
I helped Miss Jo.

454
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:43,298
Is on a foul mood.
Do not know when it is worse...

455
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,823
... when crashes or hangs when not
.

456
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:46,365
Did not you find?

457
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:48,811
No. And Rodock is furious.

458
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:52,201
Jo, this man is not for you.

459
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:58,810
Wow, Jo!

460
00:31:00,718 --> 00:31:03,682
- I think you've been in labor.
- I midwife with Cooky.

461
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:07,460
- Male or female?
- Ah... I do not know.

462
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,849
Any woman who is not curious?

463
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,690
How do you feel,
Jeremy?

464
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:17,848
Nothing like a good drink
to get in shape.

465
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,595
- I missed you.
- I love you too.

466
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:23,388
Nasty things I said before I left.

467
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:25,297
And I said them to you.

468
00:31:26,938 --> 00:31:30,230
Jo, when you and I are home alone
...

469
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:32,165
... and that door is closed...

470
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:35,330
... do not think about what happens outside.

471
00:31:35,803 --> 00:31:37,468
Will you go again?

472
00:31:38,404 --> 00:31:40,504
What I meant, I do not want to think about it
.

473
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:42,906
I'll try.

474
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:47,869
Ho, ho, ho!

475
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:51,307
So horse so!

476
00:31:52,903 --> 00:31:55,542
Do not be rushed!
Id slowly!

477
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,896
A good dressage
takes time!

478
00:31:58,007 --> 00:31:59,582
Hey, stay there, eh!

479
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:02,606
Up, up!

480
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:06,232
Horse,... subject!

481
00:32:14,487 --> 00:32:16,495
Release the reins, Steve!
Drop the reins!

482
00:32:16,596 --> 00:32:18,240
O no you do with them!

483
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:20,968
What do you waiting for?
Are you afraid of falling?

484
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,099
Baldy! If the guy does not work
to quit!

485
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:31,022
Mr. Rodock
is made fierce lately.

486
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:34,333
No wonder. How long will follow
looking for?

487
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:36,553
Keep believing that you can find the trail.

488
00:32:36,614 --> 00:32:39,176
's Like a wolf in a full moon.

489
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:56,253
- Good afternoon, Miss Jo.
- Good afternoon, Cooky.

490
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:22,262
Miss Jo,
is very pretty in that suit.

491
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,509
Would you still like to work, Steve
?

492
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,771
yes, but Mr. Rodock
not know if he's happy.

493
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,277
Ah, yes. He said
you learn fast.

494
00:33:31,283 --> 00:33:32,759
He has not said anything.

495
00:33:33,443 --> 00:33:35,220
But is very friendly to invent.

496
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,496
- Knights!
- Good morning, Miss!

497
00:33:41,924 --> 00:33:43,580
Calma.

498
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:46,979
Mr. Rodock has seen good and fast fingers.

499
00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:06,011
Well, I'm going to do
the night watch.

500
00:34:06,328 --> 00:34:08,422
Is job I like least.

501
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:11,409
I think every tree I hide a rustler...

502
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,741
... ready for anything. For example,
to shoot myself.

503
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:16,957
I told you to leave me alone.

504
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,026
Ask me whatever you want, Jo.
Whatever, whatever.

505
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,480
Leave me alone.

506
00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:30,238
- Sorry, Jo.
- Come, lovely.

507
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,017
So I'm not interested.

508
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:33,493
- Come, come.
- I respect you.

509
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:38,283
Dislike
McNulty is in the haystack.

510
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:41,967
Eh, poor Steve is there
eaten by jealousy.

511
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,554
In case you have not noticed, Mr.
comes Rodock.

512
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:02,340
- Hi pattern.
- Hello.

513
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:05,578
- Any luck?
- It's not just luck.

514
00:35:19,862 --> 00:35:20,973
Hello boss.

515
00:35:21,008 --> 00:35:22,974
Get your things, McNulty.
You're fired.

516
00:35:23,052 --> 00:35:25,063
I'll send the Cheyenne
paid by mail.

517
00:35:25,064 --> 00:35:27,015
- Why me goodbye?
- You will go immediately.

518
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:28,291
Desensíllalo.

519
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,422
If you get fired,
I like to know why.

520
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:36,927
Explain it.

521
00:35:37,508 --> 00:35:39,815
'm The better of his men, horses understand
...

522
00:35:39,816 --> 00:35:41,161
... I fulfill my obligation.

523
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,442
O,
chief may fear me near you...

524
00:35:46,558 --> 00:35:47,948
... just in case his girlfriend could...

525
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:50,535
Length , McNulty,
or I'll break your head.

526
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:53,836
Quiet, Rodock.
I do not like hitting a man...

527
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:57,237
Do not worry.
I do foul play.

528
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:47,366
Let go of my land
as you can move.

529
00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:19,383
You fell in love with her the first night
.

530
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,835
Does not matter.

531
00:37:20,882 --> 00:37:22,525

00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,797
Go. Good evening, sir Rodock
.

535
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:40,788
The soup is hot.

536
00:37:40,871 --> 00:37:43,202
- Do you feel like eating?
- I could eat an ox.

537
00:37:43,521 --> 00:37:47,086
I am very happy.
I fired McNulty.

538
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,991
Why?
What happened?

539
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,138
Saddle he was a little big.

540
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:57,678
But I have to admit one thing:
had a way with horses.

541
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:07,120
Jo, I want to know the truth.

542
00:38:09,027 --> 00:38:11,000
Did you know him in Cheyenne?

543
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:15,165
One day you told me that you were glad that
had not born yesterday.

544
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:17,371
Well, I was not born yesterday.

545
00:38:17,674 --> 00:38:20,563
But he was never anything to me,
and I'm glad to leave.

546
00:38:21,651 --> 00:38:24,462
Once you said you'd stay here until
...

547
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:27,167
... well, as I'd like.

548
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,721
Have you changed your mind?

549
00:38:32,384 --> 00:38:33,763
Oh, Jeremy.

550
00:38:34,443 --> 00:38:36,330
I know that I can leave if you want.

551
00:38:36,753 --> 00:38:39,966
When I came here,
was tired and sick,...

552
00:38:40,101 --> 00:38:42,403
... only planned to stay a while.

553
00:38:42,757 --> 00:38:45,998
... But I knew better.

554
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,291
I did feel that this was my home
...

555
00:38:48,546 --> 00:38:50,654
... we finally had a home.

556
00:38:51,343 --> 00:38:53,111
I can not think of a better word.

557
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,339
My home .

558
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,327
Now it is summer and I have healed.

559
00:38:57,507 --> 00:38:59,057
I do not want to go.

560
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:01,898
And you also want me to go.

561
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:05,885

00:39:10,322 --> 00:39:11,766

563
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,352
Do you know Jo?

564
00:39:27,884 --> 00:39:29,405

00:40:09,585 --> 00:40:11,087
wanted to kick me a letter in the mail.

571
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:12,114

572
00:40:12,766 --> 00:40:15,460
Just do not know how to write.
Never taught me.

573
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:18,231

In 10 years,

619
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:29,098
A nobody mounted on horseback.

620
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:31,195
- No, because I...
- That's what they are.

621
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,665
A nobody mounted on horseback.

622
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:36,603
With black teeth,
broken bones, hernia, and lice.

623
00:42:36,658 --> 00:42:37,924
But Mr. Rodock is not.

624
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:39,670

Find yourself a girlfriend, who is decent.
And marry her.

633
00:43:01,253 --> 00:43:03,982
Live in a place, where you can have
children.

00:43:05,307 --> 00:43:06,695
A normal life.

638
00:43:21,094 --> 00:43:22,820
In my old dreams.

639
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,354

- Six've tamed me.
- Yes, I know.

651

sweat mixing with a horse...

652
00:44:27,872 --> 00:44:30,088

00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:14,448
I said I did not need to hang him!

710
00:52:16,729 --> 00:52:18,473
I stole horses, right?

711
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,154
Fired against me, right?

712
00:52:20,334 --> 00:52:22,839
- Killed Waity, right?
- How do you know he killed Waity?

713
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,382
The stealing horses,
kill anyone who tries to stop him.

714
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:26,748
How do you know?

715
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,555
Do not know.

716
00:52:28,702 --> 00:52:30,320
Could kill another person.

717
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:32,166
'll Never know.

718
00:52:33,523 --> 00:52:34,860
I'll never know.

719
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:40,894
- Mr Rodock.
- Come, sit boy. Sit.

720
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:43,091
I'm sorry.

721
00:52:43,338 --> 00:52:45,102
Never had taken whiskey.

722
00:52:48,002 --> 00:52:51,525
I may be naive, it is possible yes
...

723
00:52:52,699 --> 00:52:54,075
... but, sir Rodock...

724
00:52:54,206 --> 00:52:56,260
... did not have to hang him.

725
00:52:57,472 --> 00:52:58,545
Hi Jo.

726
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:00,291
Ven. Have a drink.

727
00:53:01,977 --> 00:53:03,611
I yield my glass.

728
00:53:05,221 --> 00:53:07,113
Have you seen
you hang a man?

729
00:53:10,908 --> 00:53:13,393
- Steve!
- Do not worry about it.

730
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:15,628
It will happen.
Come, drink with me.

731
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,234
I tell Jo,
that is the only way.

732
00:53:24,233 --> 00:53:26,358
Fear makes the honest men.

733
00:53:26,446 --> 00:53:29,438
With the hanging of today, I have raised a fence
...

734
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,998
... 3 meters high,
around my ranch.

735
00:53:32,727 --> 00:53:34,814
I know what you think, and you
that guy!

736
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,786
That I'm the thief and murderer
!

737
00:53:36,845 --> 00:53:39,545
- Please Jeremy.
- But I do not understand anything!

738
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:42,156
First there is no law!

739
00:53:42,339 --> 00:53:44,113
Then the man makes his own law!

740
00:53:44,964 --> 00:53:47,786
People think very much the steal again!

741
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:50,223
I'm happy for you.

742
00:53:52,819 --> 00:53:54,629
Oh, Jo.

743
00:53:59,253 --> 00:54:02,443
Remember few weeks ago,...

744
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:04,632
... once that door closed
...

745
00:54:04,803 --> 00:54:07,757
... would not consider what happens
out of here.

746
00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:09,613
- Do you remember, eh?
- Yes

747
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:12,733
- All right. So...
- Have another whiskey. I'll be back.

748
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:14,072
- Where are you going?
- Out.

749
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:16,131
- What?
- Be right back.

750
00:54:16,196 --> 00:54:18,174
Do not go to console
that boy?

751
00:54:18,209 --> 00:54:19,908
I want to talk to him a moment
!

752
00:54:19,943 --> 00:54:22,515
- Is alone and depressed!
- I want you here!

753
00:54:32,857 --> 00:54:35,012
I tell her to stay and be
!

754
00:54:37,157 --> 00:54:38,773
What do you think, Cooky?

755
00:54:39,256 --> 00:54:40,948
What can a man do?

756
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,861
It's more than hanging.

757
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:46,988
Much more.

758
00:54:47,606 --> 00:54:50,637
He ​​told me he will stay, will stay.

759
00:54:51,045 --> 00:54:53,150
But
why not believe it?

760
00:54:53,224 --> 00:54:57,172
What do I put here that
tells me to go, it will go?

761
00:54:58,804 --> 00:55:00,499
When a man has a thing...

762
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,216
...
must be convinced that you have.

763
00:55:02,346 --> 00:55:04,869
That is not never gonna lose.

764
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:10,631
Steve!

765
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,677
Steve!

766
00:55:23,316 --> 00:55:24,941
I want to talk to you, Steve.

767
00:55:25,103 --> 00:55:26,471
Me alone.

768
00:55:27,686 --> 00:55:29,245
I know what happens to you.

769
00:55:32,827 --> 00:55:34,369
Come into the light, Steve.

770
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:36,614
I want to see your face when I talk to
.

771
00:55:38,206 --> 00:55:40,356
I can not forget.
His mouth was open.

772
00:55:40,391 --> 00:55:41,723
No
you should keep thinking about it.

773
00:55:41,764 --> 00:55:44,093
's What makes you,
not think about it.

774
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,468
How can you stay here?

775
00:55:46,629 --> 00:55:48,076
Listen, Steve.

776
00:55:48,146 --> 00:55:50,727
Do you think I do not care
who has hanged a man?

777
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:56,930
've Come for you because I know you're hurting.

778
00:56:01,019 --> 00:56:02,421
It was horrible.

779
00:56:02,728 --> 00:56:06,156
Do not let it harden you.
What you bitter.

780
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:10,342
Jo.
From the first night...

781
00:56:10,353 --> 00:56:12,455
I know.
Do not expect to find a woman here.

782
00:56:12,486 --> 00:56:13,821
I did not dare to think of you.

783
00:56:13,908 --> 00:56:15,244
Mr. Rodock was a kind of God.

784
00:56:15,461 --> 00:56:17,059
I thought I should not think of you.

785
00:56:17,132 --> 00:56:19,012
He is no longer a God
has hanged a man,...

786
00:56:19,057 --> 00:56:20,870
... and now
do think of you, Jo.

787
00:56:22,058 --> 00:56:23,391
I want to leave here.

788
00:56:23,572 --> 00:56:26,388
I want to make something of my life,
but I will not go without you.

789
00:56:27,621 --> 00:56:29,040
Steve.

790
00:56:39,585 --> 00:56:41,304
're So young.

791
00:56:43,846 --> 00:56:46,093
Remember what once told me.

792
00:56:46,515 --> 00:56:47,925
What you had dreamed.

793
00:56:48,298 --> 00:56:51,252
A place to live a normal life.

794
00:56:52,115 --> 00:56:54,881
'd Completely insane if not fight for offering it.

795
00:56:55,338 --> 00:56:58,122
- Is he laughing at me?
- No, not Steve.

796
00:56:59,605 --> 00:57:00,799
I'm going to do a single question.

797
00:57:00,815 --> 00:57:03,340
Please Steve, do not ask me
.

798
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:05,414
I have to go now.

799
00:57:07,386 --> 00:57:08,557
Jo.

800
00:57:11,607 --> 00:57:12,806
I love U.

801
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:37,011
- You found the guy?
- Yes

802
00:57:37,843 --> 00:57:39,976
And, how are you?
Quiet?

803
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,260
-
Yes - Good.

804
00:57:43,098 --> 00:57:47,730
Jo. The horses are already tamed
...

805
00:57:48,143 --> 00:57:50,869
... and the Wells Fargo
come within a couple of days.

806
00:57:51,172 --> 00:57:53,045
We will give a party.

807
00:57:53,614 --> 00:57:57,974
As of July 4,
with racing and horse show.

808
00:57:59,578 --> 00:58:01,135
Will it be good, eh?

809
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,745
Hey, do you remember that Greek song
...

810
00:58:13,849 --> 00:58:15,470
... I like so much?

811
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:21,570
La, la, la, lalalala, la la la...

812
00:58:21,702 --> 00:58:23,734
- Anda, touch, want.
- Currently do not!

813
00:58:23,857 --> 00:58:25,402
Right now I can not play!

814
00:59:32,664 --> 00:59:34,466
Get along, sir Rodock.

815
00:59:34,769 --> 00:59:36,817
Stop exhibirte. The
horses have done everything.

816
00:59:36,918 --> 00:59:39,486
If these animals do know, I spit in the face.

817
00:59:42,606 --> 00:59:44,706
Steve, do not worry.

818
00:59:44,785 --> 00:59:47,201
Jo, I want to see you tonight.
I have to talk to you.

819
00:59:47,262 --> 00:59:49,094
We have nothing to talk about, Steve.

820
00:59:49,139 --> 00:59:50,590
Jo... I...

821
00:59:50,946 --> 00:59:52,173
Jo!

822
00:59:52,862 --> 00:59:55,315
Look to see how
Cooky with food.

823
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:08,321
Rodock Lord.
Would be very sad that the horses go out of style.

824
01:00:08,464 --> 01:00:09,872
That will never happen.

825
01:00:10,002 --> 01:00:11,914
What will happen when the railroad comes?

826
01:00:11,949 --> 01:00:13,750
The railway will not
by large cities.

827
01:00:13,815 --> 01:00:15,522
That's what I said.

828
01:00:16,211 --> 01:00:18,975
What would big cities like New York and
Chicago without horses?

829
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,296
Exactly.

830
01:00:29,632 --> 01:00:32,290
Jo, please
have to tell you something.

831
01:00:33,777 --> 01:00:37,293
Cooky, go to the kitchen and sees
bringing the rest of the cakes.

832
01:00:37,328 --> 01:00:38,694
Yes, Miss Jo.

833
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:47,369
Jo, listen.

834
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:50,897
I do not know another way to put it.

835
01:00:51,067 --> 01:00:53,001
I love you, and I want to marry you
.

836
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,929
Steve.

837
01:00:56,371 --> 01:00:59,211
Do not even know where you come from, or what it was.

838
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:00,590
I do not care.

839
01:01:00,774 --> 01:01:02,220
I think it should.

840
01:01:02,838 --> 01:01:05,380
I'm not the woman
good for you as a wife.

841
01:01:06,765 --> 01:01:08,910
'd Have a reason to do what you did.

842
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:13,116
I had a reason.
That was the easiest solution.

843
01:01:15,819 --> 01:01:17,613
I am a child of war,
Steve.

844
01:01:18,148 --> 01:01:21,163
When I was 16, my whole family died
.

845
01:01:21,405 --> 01:01:23,750
I came to New York,
with very little money.

846
01:01:23,959 --> 01:01:26,260
Believing another country, another life...

847
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:29,130
- Jo, I do not care what...
- It was very hard for me.

848
01:01:29,212 --> 01:01:30,692
Was not prepared.

849
01:01:31,432 --> 01:01:33,666
If I could I have willpower
...

850
01:01:33,775 --> 01:01:36,241
... I would have gone to work,
like other girls.

851
01:01:36,379 --> 01:01:38,973
It was necessary to play the piano in a bar.

852
01:01:39,143 --> 01:01:41,715
I took my face and my body
.

853
01:01:41,754 --> 01:01:43,729
Played piano for men...

854
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,952
Then
Jeremy found me.

855
01:01:48,155 --> 01:01:50,650
Gave me the chance to change their lives, and I accepted.

856
01:01:50,856 --> 01:01:54,614
Then
discovered that he had fallen in love with him.

857
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,402
But he...

858
01:01:59,398 --> 01:02:01,474
I know what you think
all his men.

859
01:02:01,652 --> 01:02:02,966
're Wrong.

860
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:13,890
I know what you expected to hear.

861
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:22,163
The feast is ready.
Steve was helping me.

862
01:02:24,626 --> 01:02:26,226
Tell the men to come.

863
01:02:31,932 --> 01:02:33,455
So now is the guy.

864
01:02:33,912 --> 01:02:35,025
How do you mean?

865
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:37,313
What did you think
is this? A brothel?

866
01:02:37,394 --> 01:02:39,348
Nor I swallowed what McNulty!

867
01:02:39,391 --> 01:02:41,275
? McNulty?
What about McNulty?

868
01:02:41,305 --> 01:02:43,880
I saw you leave the barn, and
was in here...

869
01:02:43,881 --> 01:02:46,388
... in here with you!
The night I got back from Cheyenne!

870
01:02:46,485 --> 01:02:47,761
Basta, Jeremy!

871
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,794
McNulty meant nothing to me, and Steve
means nothing!

872
01:02:50,959 --> 01:02:52,120
And now you!

873
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:54,730
I known you were in Cheyenne, right?!

874
01:02:54,926 --> 01:02:56,739
I confessed  last night, do you remember
!

875
01:02:56,933 --> 01:02:58,087
Remember!

876
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,385
This party is better than the one given in Cheyenne,...

877
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:26,717
... Mr. Rodock.

878
01:03:58,098 --> 01:04:00,047
Until next summer, Mr. Rodock
!

879
01:04:08,509 --> 01:04:10,252
Come back soon!
There will be more tame horses!

880
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,953
When we run out women and money return.

881
01:04:45,954 --> 01:04:49,310
<i> Wanted to put between them as far as possible
</ i>

882
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:52,059
<i> Jocasta still wanted to </ i>

883
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:55,524
<i> But I could not stay there, knowing
. she loved Mr. Rodock </ i>

884
01:04:55,731 --> 01:04:57,362
<i> not know where I was going </ i>

885
01:04:57,431 --> 01:04:59,130
<i> simply
me away from them </ i>

886
01:05:31,741 --> 01:05:32,950
Where is Mr. Rodock
?

887
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:35,072
Since last night,
has not left the house.

888
01:05:36,787 --> 01:05:38,686
Miss Jo has asked for you.

889
01:05:46,717 --> 01:05:48,051
Rodock Lord!

890
01:05:55,427 --> 01:05:57,812
Rodock Lord.
Rodock Lord!

891
01:05:57,934 --> 01:05:59,435
Mares and foals are not.

892
01:05:59,936 --> 01:06:01,973
The mares and foals!
The stolen!

893
01:06:03,143 --> 01:06:04,854
- Where you've seen?
- I have not seen it, but...

894
01:06:04,889 --> 01:06:07,160
... gone all the valley. They've been taken.

895
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:09,522
Found a pony with a broken leg.

896
01:06:13,925 --> 01:06:15,632
Do the foals and mares stolen
?

897
01:06:17,419 --> 01:06:21,240
- Did you see footprints?
- Yes Maybe 2 or 3 days.

898
01:06:22,926 --> 01:06:25,538
- Tell the men to saddle.
- Is only Abe.

899
01:06:25,888 --> 01:06:27,433
Then tell Abe that saddle!

900
01:06:38,482 --> 01:06:39,953
Not think back.

901
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:42,416
Not want to see more hanged.

902
01:06:43,724 --> 01:06:47,798
But I had to come.
Do not know why.

903
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:51,590
Iba  Road West.

904
01:06:52,055 --> 01:06:54,436
- I've been looking.
- Abe told me so.

905
01:06:55,076 --> 01:06:56,589
I wanted to say goodbye.

906
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:58,441
I'm going too.

907
01:06:59,203 --> 01:07:00,227
Are you going?

908
01:07:01,215 --> 01:07:02,973
Do not want to live here.

909
01:07:03,447 --> 01:07:04,760
Let me go with you.

910
01:07:05,008 --> 01:07:06,826
A Cheyenne to San Francisco,
wherever you want.

911
01:07:06,827 --> 01:07:09,433
Let me be with you until... until...

912
01:07:09,798 --> 01:07:12,600
...
change your mind and marry me.

913
01:07:13,777 --> 01:07:15,785
I... I have to go with Mr. Rodock.

914
01:07:15,851 --> 01:07:17,271
No one will go with Abe.

915
01:07:17,306 --> 01:07:19,957
But... do not go back until
.

916
01:07:20,084 --> 01:07:21,302
Please Jo.

917
01:07:24,184 --> 01:07:26,761
Right, Steve.
I'll wait.

918
01:07:47,629 --> 01:07:49,495
Is there nothing we can do for him?

919
01:07:50,513 --> 01:07:51,748
No.

920
01:07:58,556 --> 01:08:01,136
Abe. Do it.

921
01:08:16,516 --> 01:08:19,639
We have fresh tracks.

922
01:08:21,734 --> 01:08:22,933
You were right, kid.

923
01:08:23,313 --> 01:08:24,995
From now, 2 or 3 days.

924
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:27,825
But I do not understand how
Colts took.

925
01:08:27,889 --> 01:08:29,705
With them you can not go fast.

926
01:08:36,198 --> 01:08:38,485
I did not know we were to make this.

927
01:08:39,702 --> 01:08:41,752
Okay.
Well you know.

928
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:43,854
If I'd known, I would have
unaccompanied.

929
01:08:43,991 --> 01:08:47,265
When the die has left your hand
and you can not change the fate.

930
01:08:57,671 --> 01:08:59,605
Apparently
have a visitor.

931
01:09:03,114 --> 01:09:04,159
Hello Mac

932
01:09:04,334 --> 01:09:06,348
Hi Steve.
How do you here?

933
01:09:06,991 --> 01:09:09,657
Rodock fired me.
I'm Cheyenne.

934
01:09:10,515 --> 01:09:12,573
- How is Jo?
- Still there.

935
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:18,228
- So you have a job.
- Yes, I have.

936
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,218
This is not the way to Cheyenne.

937
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:24,153
Mac, tell him I
I can go anywhere.

938
01:09:24,993 --> 01:09:26,747
Sure, Steve, of course.

939
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:29,125
As you let us go.

940
01:09:29,482 --> 01:09:30,966
Freeze.

941
01:09:36,979 --> 01:09:38,504
Desármalos  Steve.

942
01:09:40,506 --> 01:09:43,332
Abe, scrape out the horses.

943
01:09:57,277 --> 01:10:00,457
McNulty.
I'll hang.

944
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:04,627
Bind them, Steve.
From hands and feet.

945
01:10:04,696 --> 01:10:07,091
Rodock Lord, and let Abe
relocate to the strong Whitney.

946
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:08,318
Obey.

947
01:10:28,047 --> 01:10:30,105
Quiescent, beautiful... still.

948
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:39,865
You mutilated my mares.

949
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:44,652
- The've left hoof.
- What have you done?

950
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:47,406
Nobody considers that a man...

951
01:10:48,068 --> 01:10:50,194
... so would an animal.

952
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:53,348
- Why did you do it?
- I'll tell you what, Steve.

953
01:10:53,494 --> 01:10:55,642
If a horse is trimmed hooves...

954
01:10:55,963 --> 01:10:57,342
... you can not walk.

955
01:10:57,603 --> 01:11:00,082
's Like you nailed you
a knife between the nails.

956
01:11:00,243 --> 01:11:02,087
He ​​did not escape to.

957
01:11:02,316 --> 01:11:04,573
So
mares would not move from here.

958
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:08,155
foals would stay with them while having to suck
.

959
01:11:08,265 --> 01:11:13,615
So these scoundrels, the scoundrels,
have a good alibi.

960
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,362
Would return when the foals are weaned
...

961
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:18,844
... and would have a bunch of horses unbranded
Rodock.

962
01:11:19,113 --> 01:11:20,499
So he did, Steve.

963
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:23,967
Mr. McNulty,
has great ideas.

964
01:11:24,884 --> 01:11:26,795
Have great ideas.

965
01:11:34,525 --> 01:11:38,755
Abe, we will not need this rope
.

966
01:11:38,935 --> 01:11:40,938
Suéltales bondage feet.

967
01:11:42,183 --> 01:11:43,444
You too, Steve.

968
01:11:54,482 --> 01:11:55,871
Take away the boots.

969
01:11:58,114 --> 01:11:59,422
Do not! Not me!

970
01:12:11,812 --> 01:12:14,452
Rodock. The boy did not want to do that
mares.

971
01:12:14,487 --> 01:12:15,668
Let it be.

972
01:12:16,606 --> 01:12:18,627
Do not need to beg anyone for me.

973
01:12:19,862 --> 01:12:25,434
McNulty.
How to calculate from here to Fort Whitney?

974
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:26,734
Far is .

975
01:12:27,417 --> 01:12:29,808
Y
for those who are used to go riding...

976
01:12:30,105 --> 01:12:32,453
... is a long way.

977
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:34,857
Stop playing games, Rodock.

978
01:12:35,252 --> 01:12:37,974
Now you will have chance to know what my horses suffer.

979
01:12:38,829 --> 01:12:39,923
Abe.

980
01:12:41,146 --> 01:12:43,231
Steve and I take
to Fort Whitney.

981
01:12:43,712 --> 01:12:47,291
You stay here with the animals until we can take them as
.

982
01:12:47,844 --> 01:12:51,494
Steve.
Go get their horses.

983
01:13:08,408 --> 01:13:09,896
Move!

984
01:13:20,254 --> 01:13:21,865
For pity, sir.

985
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:24,667
- Can not resist long.
- Shut up, Barjak!

986
01:13:24,732 --> 01:13:26,899
We threw the dice.
The game is.

987
01:14:05,192 --> 01:14:06,758
Do not ever try!

988
01:14:38,901 --> 01:14:40,515
Desátales hands.

989
01:15:12,848 --> 01:15:14,579
I have a long way.

990
01:15:21,337 --> 01:15:22,776
Well, that's enough.

991
01:15:22,859 --> 01:15:24,765
Tie them to a tree,
spend the night here.

992
01:16:43,374 --> 01:16:45,042
Animals need
rest.

993
01:16:45,431 --> 01:16:46,724
'll Stop here.

994
01:17:14,112 --> 01:17:16,019
Put ​​yourself in the foot!
We're going!

995
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:26,389
Arise Barjak.

996
01:17:26,577 --> 01:17:27,599
Get up!

997
01:17:27,846 --> 01:17:29,811
I said get up.

998
01:17:29,856 --> 01:17:31,797
Come on!
We have to go!

999
01:17:31,816 --> 01:17:33,680
Arise Barjak!
Up!

1000
01:17:37,165 --> 01:17:38,429
That's better.

1001
01:17:39,698 --> 01:17:41,296
But that is not you get a horse.

1002
01:17:41,338 --> 01:17:44,968
Do you really think us
walk there, and surrender?

1003
01:17:45,025 --> 01:17:47,263
Certainly
up right there.

1004
01:17:47,641 --> 01:17:49,054
Do not steal was enough.

1005
01:17:49,182 --> 01:17:51,091
Torturasteis my horses.

1006
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,827
You are not only thieves, but
cruel men.

1007
01:17:54,054 --> 01:17:56,904
You are solely greedy and cruel.

1008
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:23,033
Rodock Lord,
has to stop.

1009
01:18:47,945 --> 01:18:49,484
Upload it to your horse.

1010
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,437
Arriba. We're going.

1011
01:19:14,307 --> 01:19:17,465
My father must kill
20 years.

1012
01:20:04,292 --> 01:20:06,245
This is not punishment,
Mr. Rodock.

1013
01:20:06,353 --> 01:20:07,858
Is revenge.

1014
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,592
Not human.

1015
01:20:23,616 --> 01:20:25,437
I can not.

1016
01:20:32,865 --> 01:20:34,382
Upload it to your horse.

1017
01:20:53,339 --> 01:20:54,383
Lars!

1018
01:20:54,527 --> 01:20:55,915
For!

1019
01:20:56,526 --> 01:20:57,767
Lars!

1020
01:20:58,010 --> 01:21:00,290
Basta, you hear me!

1021
01:21:00,357 --> 01:21:01,467
For!

1022
01:21:02,329 --> 01:21:04,194
Enough, boy!
That's enough!

1023
01:21:06,189 --> 01:21:08,277
Lars. Come on, son.

1024
01:21:08,312 --> 01:21:10,155
Upload the horse.

1025
01:21:11,105 --> 01:21:13,116
Come on, boy.
You hear me, boy?

1026
01:21:15,846 --> 01:21:19,824
You two, get the hell out.
Iros far and fast!

1027
01:21:20,066 --> 01:21:23,321
Do you return to get close to me, or my
lands, while you are alive.

1028
01:21:23,366 --> 01:21:24,504
Go away!

1029
01:21:26,711 --> 01:21:28,404
Anda boy.
You come with me.

1030
01:21:28,514 --> 01:21:29,727
Me alone.

1031
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:43,194
Here is your son, Ellie.

1032
01:21:47,994 --> 01:21:48,893
Lars!

1033
01:21:50,087 --> 01:21:51,222
Lars!

1034
01:21:52,034 --> 01:21:54,596
- Do you intervene, mother!
- No more deaths!

1035
01:21:54,597 --> 01:21:57,546
- I do not know what he has done.
- I know what you've done!

1036
01:21:58,283 --> 01:22:00,817
And I know that you have returned
you alive! That's enough.

1037
01:22:05,512 --> 01:22:07,837
I have nothing against you, Jeremy.

1038
01:22:09,035 --> 01:22:11,825
And I want to thank you for bringing me home
my son.

1039
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:16,190
Ellie, once
I told you to get out of here.

1040
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:19,473
- Go East, and take the boy.
- I'm not leaving.

1041
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:25,680
I should remember as it was small.

1042
01:22:25,828 --> 01:22:27,805
When I got him on his first horse.

1043
01:22:29,094 --> 01:22:31,298
Well, if you empeñáis
in stay, you will...

1044
01:22:31,428 --> 01:22:33,756
... you send an item
of mares and foals.

1045
01:22:33,931 --> 01:22:35,744
- Lars And can...
- I do not want.

1046
01:22:36,505 --> 01:22:39,283
Do you think that will pay
which made me and my father?

1047
01:22:40,306 --> 01:22:42,476
Yes, my father was weak.

1048
01:22:42,653 --> 01:22:45,062
And you are strong, but
could help.

1049
01:22:46,001 --> 01:22:47,843
Well, saw
I'm not weak.

1050
01:22:47,915 --> 01:22:49,526
If you would handle it.

1051
01:22:49,918 --> 01:22:54,158
I'll run bad, I work hard, and
Raise my own horses.

1052
01:22:56,224 --> 01:22:57,840
Now out!

1053
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,379
I feel some slack,
boy.

1054
01:23:03,004 --> 01:23:04,464
I have learned from you.

1055
01:23:07,346 --> 01:23:09,425
Then
sorry for both.

1056
01:23:13,616 --> 01:23:15,270
Oh, Lars.

1057
01:23:24,403 --> 01:23:27,137
Steve. Tomorrow, first thing,...

1058
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:30,102
... go find and tell Abe
carrying mares and foals...

1059
01:23:30,147 --> 01:23:31,767
... Peterson's ranch.

1060
01:23:32,084 --> 01:23:33,515
Lars will care either.

1061
01:23:34,231 --> 01:23:36,016
Your mother will see to that.

1062
01:23:48,328 --> 01:23:51,302
- Still thinking of going?
- Anytime, Steve.

1063
01:23:54,053 --> 01:23:55,141
It's okay.

1064
01:24:02,256 --> 01:24:05,910
Rodock Lord. When your message to
Abe, not back.

1065
01:24:06,888 --> 01:24:08,355
May be the best.

1066
01:24:09,054 --> 01:24:10,632
Instead
money he owes me...

1067
01:24:10,846 --> 01:24:12,871
... I can take the other horse and buggy
?

1068
01:24:13,697 --> 01:24:15,441
What do you want the buggy?

1069
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,222
The Miss Jo with me.

1070
01:24:31,549 --> 01:24:33,542
Are you going to take Jocasta
you?

1071
01:24:35,113 --> 01:24:36,175
Yes, sir.

1072
01:24:37,996 --> 01:24:40,892
- Does she know?
- Yes

1073
01:25:05,102 --> 01:25:06,756
Take the buggy.

1074
01:25:13,714 --> 01:25:14,868
Jeremy.

1075
01:25:15,579 --> 01:25:16,602
Jeremy.

1076
01:25:19,654 --> 01:25:21,918
Guess
not much to explain.

1077
01:25:22,967 --> 01:25:26,229
No. Even a blind man would see it.

1078
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:28,057
Is given one turn,
and stolen all...

1079
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:30,912
-... a horse, a woman.
- To me nobody steals from me!

1080
01:25:31,137 --> 01:25:33,020
I'm going by my will.

1081
01:25:33,155 --> 01:25:35,983
I heart, and head, and I know
I decide for myself.

1082
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:38,389
I am a human being.
Not an animal, Jeremy.

1083
01:25:38,491 --> 01:25:40,393
'm Not even one Rodock mare.

1084
01:25:40,605 --> 01:25:42,963
You understand horses, but humans
...

1085
01:25:43,007 --> 01:25:44,622
... you have no idea.

1086
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,058
Now I understand why I have not married,...

1087
01:25:51,093 --> 01:25:52,679
... or even what you thought.

1088
01:25:53,027 --> 01:25:55,647
wedding must put the heart in the other person.

1089
01:25:55,959 --> 01:25:58,327
How can you put it, if you do not trust
.

1090
01:26:10,504 --> 01:26:12,109
Upload the car, Cooky.

1091
01:27:12,445 --> 01:27:13,512
Goodbye, Cooky.

1092
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:16,299
- Good luck.
- Goodbye, Miss Jo.

1093
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:56,053
Is difficult to understand.

1094
01:27:56,485 --> 01:27:58,183
Think you know him,
and not true.

1095
01:27:58,529 --> 01:28:01,010
Was ready to hang,
and not hanged anyone.

1096
01:28:01,464 --> 01:28:04,119
Said we would take them to the sheriff
barefoot.

1097
01:28:04,509 --> 01:28:06,630
But when the boy was determined to follow
...

1098
01:28:06,749 --> 01:28:08,684
... he begged her to stop.

1099
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:11,603
Y,
then release the other two...

1100
01:28:11,643 --> 01:28:14,150
... And gives a lot of horses
Peterson's son.

1101
01:28:15,031 --> 01:28:18,128
And when we came,
and said I had done well,...

1102
01:28:18,164 --> 01:28:20,479
... turned against me, as if I hated
.

1103
01:28:21,264 --> 01:28:22,895
"I'll leave it," said
.

1104
01:28:23,054 --> 01:28:25,266
"I'm sick of
men hunt and kill them."

1105
01:28:25,642 --> 01:28:27,152
"I'll sell the ranch."

1106
01:28:29,453 --> 01:28:32,032
Is very difficult to understand Mr. Rodock.

1107
01:28:35,808 --> 01:28:36,952
Television

1108
01:28:43,688 --> 01:28:45,025
You forgot one thing.

1109
01:28:46,245 --> 01:28:48,772
No. I do not want.

1110
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:52,750
Yes Take them.

1111
01:28:55,787 --> 01:28:56,878
Good luck.

1112
01:29:21,531 --> 01:29:22,652
Where are you going?

1113
01:29:22,721 --> 01:29:24,550
I may not know
write letters.

1114
01:29:24,739 --> 01:29:26,524
But where you belong.

1115
01:29:35,964 --> 01:29:36,886
What about Jo?
What?

1116
01:29:36,931 --> 01:29:38,617
Jeremy, I want to stay.

1117
01:29:38,833 --> 01:29:40,973
Ah, no, no.
You were in the right direction.

1118
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:42,872
- You must go with Steve.
- I never wanted to leave.

1119
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:46,956
I've told Steve.
I told you I love you.

1120
01:30:05,664 --> 01:30:09,535
Steve.
I need the buggy.

1121
01:30:10,612 --> 01:30:11,650
I give Evan.

1122
01:30:11,812 --> 01:30:14,336
Always liked.
Treat him well.

1123
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:28,110
- Goodbye Jo.
- Goodbye Steve.

1124
01:30:28,488 --> 01:30:31,586
- Goodbye Mr. Rodock.
- Goodbye son.

1125
01:30:32,103 --> 01:30:34,074
Send news occasionally, huh?

1126
01:30:38,619 --> 01:30:42,288
Do not worry. No one
heart breaks for first love.

1127
01:30:42,592 --> 01:30:44,257
As for the latter.

1128
01:30:46,203 --> 01:30:48,559
Jo, I'm going to ask now
.

1129
01:30:49,071 --> 01:30:52,225
Outdoor.
Before Alex and Chloe.

1130
01:30:52,319 --> 01:30:56,020
- Will you marry me?
- And I tell you, to them, yes.

1131
01:30:57,064 --> 01:30:58,979
<i> I saw Mr. Rodock </ i>

1132
01:30:59,130 --> 01:31:00,958
<i> I did not see Jocasta </ ​​i>

1133
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:03,503
<i> But both
always accompanied me. </ i>

1134
01:31:03,885 --> 01:31:06,482
<i>  Still wanted them,
all my life. </ I>
