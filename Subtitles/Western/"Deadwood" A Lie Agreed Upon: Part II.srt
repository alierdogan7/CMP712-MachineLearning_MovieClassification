1
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,200
- That's good.
- How's Bullock doing?

2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,200
I don't discuss my patients, one with another.

3
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,900
Bleeding through his fucking ear?

4
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,300
He was bleeding through it pretty
fucking good out there in the thoroughfare.

5
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,400
Tell me about that other department.

6
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,800
Inform that fucking lunatic
next you see him

7
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,500
I'm fit as a fucking fiddle
and ready to play on.

8
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,100
Inform me, Al, to what mark

9
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,600
in your piss-pot did you fill?

10
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,800
The volume was adequate.
I didn't check the mark.

11
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,200
Any discharge of gleets,
burning or soreness?

12
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
I got your suit back from Mr.

13
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,900
It's kind of, like,
aromafied from that solvent.

14
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,300
Why don't you let it cure in the air for
a while, huh, Johnny?

15
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Not on the balcony.
Not on the fucking balcony.

16
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,200
Gleets, burning, soreness?

17
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,800
He's come back to my hotel.

18
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,300
Bullock.

19
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Upstairs to the widow.
I can't say if they're in rut.

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,600
I didn't linger for the song of the bedstead.

21
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,400
Let me go check
on those fucking whores.

22
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,700
No more in that department.
That fucking discussion is over.

23
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,900
I was relieved Mr. Star and Mr.
Utter weren't more badly injured.

24
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,100
Yes.

25
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,800
I hope my coming to your store
caused no awkwardness.

26
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,700
It was kind of you bringing that
basket for my family.

27
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,200
May I ask if you had been aware their
arrival was so imminent?

28
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
No.

29
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,400
She had written that William
seemed entirely recovered,

30
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,800
but no mention of intending to travel.

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
He's handsome...

32
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,100
Your brother's son.

33
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,200
He's a fine boy.

34
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,400
I would so like to see to your injuries,

35
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,800
however superficially.

36
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,600
My proposal would be we leave the camp
immediately,

37
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
or remain and sever connection.

38
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,900
A choice for me to make?

39
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,900
Yes.

40
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't seek to absolve myself.

41
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,700
I don't believe i'm to be relied
upon for good judgment.

42
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,400
Or even for an account of your own feelings?

43
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,000
I only know

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,700
that for us to stay and not sever connection

45
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,900
would add lying to her humiliation,

46
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,200
- renew her humiliation daily.
- Yes, I understand.

47
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,000
- You say I must choose immediately?
- Tonight.

48
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,800
I'd need some part of tonight to consider.

49
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,200
- Yes.
- Others are involved for me as well.

50
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,100
I'll come back in a few hours.

51
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,000
Be very careful in the interim, Mr. Bullock.

52
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,300
All right.

53
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,100
Be careful.

54
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,800
...two, fucking three.

55
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,100
Easy.

56
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,200
A lovely family, the Bullocks.

57
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,600
Grand.

58
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Looked forward all this while,
and meet them with my load on.

59
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,000
Easy does it.

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,500
- Easy!
- Two, fucking three!

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,900
Thank you, Mr. Utter.

62
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,700
- Okay.
- Much obliged, Mr. Merrick.

63
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,400
I got him.

64
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,300
Look the fuck out.

65
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,200
I ought probably to get some weapons.

66
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,800
Why?

67
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,100
What?

68
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,600
Why would you?

69
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,700
Maybe you didn't notice
Bullock was without his gun.

70
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,500
No, I did.

71
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,300
Perhaps with the ringing in your ears,

72
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,300
you didn't hear Mr. Bullock say he'd
get his old weapon back.

73
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,800
You think maybe a new one might be useful

74
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,800
to Bullock arranging his old one's return?

75
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,300
And more backing his position?

76
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
May I have a word with Sol?

77
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,700
Sure.

78
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,800
- Will you mind if I hang around awhile?
- Fuck, no.

79
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,100
Self-deluding, interfering motherfucker.

80
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,700
I'm sorry you got shot.

81
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,900
A man like me gets used to it.

82
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,100
If it had came to it,

83
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
i'd have seen to dissolving the partnership,

84
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,400
sending your mother the proceeds.

85
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,900
Why would i expect otherwise?

86
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,900
- And I know you would do the same.
- What are you thinking of?

87
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,100
Along with any funds I might forward.

88
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,200
From the afterlife, you mean?

89
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,500
Any funds I would send subsequent,

90
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,700
I know you would administer in their interest

91
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,700
- Martha and the boy.
- Yes, you're correct.

92
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,500
What are you fucking thinking of?

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,600
What we've built and been through,

94
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,300
you don't get to walk away
without saying why.

95
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,800
You know why.

96
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,000
That don't mean you don't have to say it.

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm sick of knowing and you not saying.

98
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,200
- I love her.
- Good! you fucking said it.

99
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,000
And now I get to tell you you're wrong.

100
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,700
You  loved her these
months and stayed.

101
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,300
It ain't love that'd make you run, but shame.

102
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,000
Now let me ask you this,

103
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,800
you think shame would end

104
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
when you cleared the fucking camp?

105
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,700
It's shameful either way, Sol.

106
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,300
It's life either way, Seth.

107
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,700
I'm sorry you got shot.

108
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,200
Well, i am too, but I like being loaded.

109
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,700
I like telling you what the fuck I think,
you cocksucker.

110
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,400
I  know you will see to their interests.

111
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,300
Yes, I will, you cocksucker!

112
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,900
And I like saying "cocksucker."
What the fuck do you think of that?!

113
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Want a fast blow-job?

114
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
What?

115
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,300
Quick open air blow-job.

116
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,700
Uh, no, thank you.

117
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,200
- Bullock.
- Charlie.

118
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,400
Maybe Mr. Star will want one.

119
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,600
Thanks for going against orders.

120
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,500
I'll tell you,
I got such a fucking ringing in my ears.

121
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,200
Thanks for taking my back before.

122
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,200
Oh, you're welcome.

123
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Hey, I'll bet your wife and son

124
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,700
are overtook by that lovely
home you built them.

125
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,200
Ah, and what did that boy say about a
creek in his own front yard?

126
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,000
And that's a fine appearance he makes.

127
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,300
And if you don't mind my saying,

128
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,400
she is one striking woman, Mrs. Bullock.

129
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,400
Sense of dignified and upright.

130
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,600
Thank you.

131
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,400
Anyways, where the fuck you headed?

132
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,400
To get my things from Al Swearengen.

133
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:48,401
Maybe for a word with Dan Dority too.

134
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Gave me this fucking headache.

135
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,400
To the Gem then.

136
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,700
Jesus Christ.

137
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,800
I'm faint.

138
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,600
A faintness come over me.

139
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,200
Oh, Jesus.

140
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,100
That's a lightheaded fucking sensation.

141
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,900
Did you want to go to your place?

142
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,300
Oh, maybe I should.

143
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,700
Maybe that's the fucking prudent course.

144
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,100
Give me some weight.

145
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,900
Come on.

146
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Yeah, to not keel forward

147
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,300
and drown in fucking horseshit.

148
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,200
How are you feeling?

149
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,900
Things are a little wavy-like before my eyes.

150
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Fuck the Gem. Gem'll fucking wait.

151
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,800
For what it's worth,
Yankton's afraid of Bullock.

152
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, say no more.

153
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,700
Refrain from explaining yourself.

154
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,200
Till congress approves, nothing's to say
the hills get made part of Dakota.

155
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,700
Far as that, Montana's got pull Dakota don't.

156
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,000
Montana's got silver for bribes.

157
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,500
Thieving indian agent's all fucking
Dakota's got.

158
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,600
It ain't fucking fresh money to the game.

159
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,400
And how does that argue for bullock
living or dying?

160
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,100
Yankton thinks Bullock's Montana's man.

161
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,300
On what basis?

162
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,600
He was favorite of a judge in Helena
that wanted him in politics.

163
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,300
They figure he's a stalking horse
here for the judge's interests.

164
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,800
Then Yankton's got their
head up their fucking asses

165
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,300
if they think Bullock's
anybody's man.

166
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,100
Hell, Bullock himself don't even
know whose man he is.

167
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,900
In the thoroughfare,
as I readied to stab the cocksucker,

168
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,800
did you have no impulse to hint at this?

169
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,500
The moment didn't seem right.

170
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,000
Over time, your quickness
with a cocky rejoinder

171
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,200
must have gotten you
many punches in the face.

172
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,000
Depends what you call "many."

173
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,200
There's another fucking clever one.

174
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,700
To Yankton's thinking,

175
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,500
Would Bullock dead
curb Montana's interests

176
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,600
or incite them
to a stronger expression?

177
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,500
- I don't know.
- If he's spoiling to mix it with us further,

178
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
they may get a chance to find out.

179
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,800
He will leave with me,

180
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
if tell him that's my wish.

181
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,600
As to what our life would be,
that's another question.

182
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,100
I would say, ma'am, it might be like
living atop a volcano.

183
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,200
- That's been done, Miss Isringhausen.
- Certainly.

184
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,900
And with a good deal of
excitement, I should think.

185
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,600
A sense of high adventure every day.

186
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,900
And, of course, danger.

187
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,800
As to excitement, would you possibly...

188
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,400
add happiness?

189
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Why not, Mrs. Garrett?

190
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,100
Please don't be angry with me, ma'am.

191
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,500
No.

192
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,700
We do love each other.

193
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,400
Our being together ought not to seem
so outlandish a proposition...

194
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,300
No, ma'am.

195
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,000
... except for every other single thing.

196
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,200
Oh boy.

197
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, there you go.
Thank you, thank you, Bullock.

198
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,400
All right.

199
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm next to completely collected.

200
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,400
Three separate occasions I've been shot at,
hit, and fought on.

201
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,200
And  now, a miss takes my equilibrium.

202
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,800
Anyways.

203
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,100
You want to get to the Gem, huh?

204
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,900
- Yeah.
- Why?

205
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
I told you why.

206
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,000
Well, i mean why just this instant,

207
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
say, different from later a little while,

208
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,500
when a friend could back your play?

209
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,500
I mean,
someplace you need to get to after that?

210
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,900
I got the elements stored in the back.

211
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,600
I hope to Christ you do.

212
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,000
Come in.

213
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,600
Don't anyone bolt for freedom.

214
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,700
I kept accumulating them secret
so Cy wouldn't think I was proceeding.

215
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,900
Well, well, well.

216
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,900
- There's the wallpaper you sent, Maddie.
- Yes, ma'am.

217
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,700
Ladies, why don't you put your attention
to some of the lighter furniture,

218
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,700
and we'll hire some great
minds to do the heavy lifting?

219
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,500
Roll up your sleeves, Doris.
hard work dispels worry.

220
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,500
I pray to God your shoulder pain's

221
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,500
like some sharp-toothed creature's
inside chewing at it and gnawing.

222
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,500
How did I give offense?

223
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,200
No one needs feeling as good as you'd
feel otherwise.

224
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,400
I say from fucking experience.

225
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,300
And I didn't need the fucking activity today

226
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,300
and the fucking crises.

227
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,100
I prefer sucking prick is the fucking
short of it.

228
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,300
I would settle for a vigorous hand-holding.

229
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,000
You are a funny fucking Jew.

230
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,700
...and type that insinuates himself.

231
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,200
General principle,

232
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,200
I believe in fostering people's
tries at improving theirselves,

233
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,300
and I think you all also
know at I got a special fondness

234
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
for Joanie Stubbs.

235
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,500
And if those things wasn't true,

236
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,000
in this camp at this precise juncture,

237
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,400
I, Cy Tolliver, would not have backed

238
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
an exclusively high-end whoring operation

239
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,300
at the far fucking end of the camp

240
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,300
without concealed access for its trade.

241
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,500
But, be that as it may,

242
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,000
and wishing Joanie godspeed,

243
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,300
this congregation gathers so that
I can assure each of you

244
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,100
that our operation here, the Bella Union,

245
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,300
is organized exactly

246
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,700
to capitalize on what this camp is ready for

247
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,700
and for what it's going to become.

248
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,200
I want each of you to take one of these...

249
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,800
as a gesture of optimism and good will.

250
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,200
Keep your fucking distance!

251
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,600
Remain on your side
of the street!

252
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,400
Do not interfere with me in any way!

253
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Chinese cocksuckers!

254
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,000
Jesus.

255
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Well, you are an entangled inebriate,
are you not?

256
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,000
This happens to be a rig and contraption

257
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,300
of my own devising

258
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,700
against repeated accidental falls

259
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,800
that has temporarily malfunctioned.

260
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,000
Very well knotted.

261
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,900
I'm back in camp, Cochran,

262
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,500
'cause I'm dying

263
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,200
and I need a place
to breathe my fucking last,

264
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,600
and not for no human aid or consolation.

265
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,500
Jesus Christ, you're bad with your hands!

266
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,600
If I wasn't practically fucking dead,

267
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,200
I'd reach that knife and cut myself free.

268
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,200
And I just farted. so what?

269
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,900
Don't you disarm me, you cocksucker!

270
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,200
Lift me up so I can cut myself free.

271
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,300
All right. you ready?

272
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,800
All right now, give me that hand.

273
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,200
Now...

274
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
step inside

275
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,600
and let me examine you,
even if you are past help.

276
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,800
Enhancing my understanding

277
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,500
may allow others the benefit of your
mortal illness.

278
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,500
Do you mock me, cocksucker?

279
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,700
No.

280
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,300
Come on inside.

281
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,500
All right, there we go.

282
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,100
Promise when I'm dead, you'll plant me
with a view of where Bill is.

283
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,000
He couldn't have meant that, not possibly.

284
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,600
Well, I shouldn't have thought so.

285
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,700
You don't believe he imagines
were he and I to go,

286
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,300
I'd leave Sophia behind?

287
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I can't be certain, Mrs. Garret.
I didn't hear him speak.

288
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,200
Because others rescued her and nursed her,

289
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,000
is the idea that she belongs to the camp?

290
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Are we some sort of vicious,
filthy outpost of brook farm?

291
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,200
She's been with me
for seven months.

292
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
She's a part of my life as I am of hers.

293
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
He couldn't have.

294
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,400
I will not!

295
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,200
Jane, for me, the female breast

296
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,000
has long ago lost all mystery or allure.

297
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,500
open your goddamn blouse.

298
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,300
I'm keeping my eyes shut,

299
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,300
but I'll know every fucking move you make!

300
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,700
I'll have you further promise

301
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,000
that you won't forage in my remains
after i'm dead,

302
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,600
as you obviously don't scruple from
that type of sick behavior.

303
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,200
I promise.

304
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
All right, sit up if you're not too drunk.

305
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,800
Your liver runs from your
chin to your genitals,

306
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,000
so I suggest you quit drinking.

307
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,400
I will when you do, you ugly son of a bitch.

308
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,900
Nature is a forgiving mistress,

309
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,600
and you might could have some time to fill

310
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,800
before she collects her due.

311
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,700
As if I'd credit any opinions of yours

312
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,600
on the subject of health.

313
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Well, if you do care to sojourn among us,

314
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,200
Charlie Utter has put aside

315
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,500
a room for you at the freight building.

316
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,900
Does he have any animals in there?

317
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,600
Fort Cooper...

318
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,700
on the Butterfield Stage route.

319
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,700
I know that fort.

320
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,700
- On the Brazos. - That's where I found him.

321
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,300
I was 13,

322
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,800
and he had to send me back.

323
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,100
But we had...

324
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,400
a good talk before I left.

325
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,700
Probably I'd have come looking for him again,

326
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,900
but next year was the war.

327
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,600
Robert was cavalry.

328
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
No way to locate where he was.

329
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,100
The fucking war had everyone all over
everywhere.

330
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,700
We wrote.

331
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,900
Less after my father passed

332
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,900
and I headed to Montana.

333
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,800
I had letters when he married,

334
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,600
when they had their boy.

335
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,000
And we'd threaten visits.

336
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,200
When I finally did come to Fort Quitman
where Robert was posted and...

337
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
met Martha and William,

338
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,900
Robert wasn't there.

339
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,400
He was following back some raid
across the Rio Grande.

340
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,600
I had let it wait too long.

341
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,900
He got shot and killed in Mexico

342
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,500
and was buried there.

343
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Fucking Mexico.

344
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,400
I went down,

345
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,500
found him

346
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,900
and brought him back.

347
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Wrong to let him lay there...

348
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,700
unless you're a Mexican.

349
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,100
My bowels are in an upheaval.

350
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,600
I'll walk off to pass wind.

351
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,400
Don't ever say I'm not a fucking gentleman.

352
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,100
Fuck you two!

353
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,400
No. 10...

354
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,300
ruled me off, the round-eyed toads.

355
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,800
Cocksucker.

356
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,200
My concern, past your physical well-being,

357
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,900
is what the dispute portends.

358
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,300
Yeah, I don't know.

359
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,400
Is it settled between you two
or still unresolved?

360
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,600
I don't fucking know.

361
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,400
Your ribs are hurting, ain't they?

362
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Yeah, they fucking hurt.

363
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,200
Well, I always believed,
of His sufferings on the cross,

364
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,200
His busted ribs would have hurt Him the worst.

365
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,500
Hey, Adams? cutthroat friend, huh?

366
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,100
And I thought you was in Florida
having your belly rubbed by a seminole.

367
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,300
- What the fuck?
- You aren't going to believe what happened to me, boss.

368
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,700
If Kate Hogranch is part of this story
and fucking that half-breed,

369
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,100
go ahead and try me.

370
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,000
That's not the stop that detained me.

371
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,600
I'm past my fill of this shit.

372
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Next time don't fucking catch up.

373
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,600
Guess the day of the Samaritan's passed.

374
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,400
Stopped  help stranded sisters.

375
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,000
Hi.

376
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,900
Severe reprimand.

377
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,400
Them two seem disputatious as well, huh?

378
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,300
Storm clouds gather.

379
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,300
Think you about got her clean there, hoss.

380
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,400
Another fucking clever one.

381
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,200
You know I bet when you and your
partner's out on the trail,

382
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,500
When you ain't greasing poles
and choosing who's going to be rider,

383
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,400
I bet you and him just bust each other's guts
with your little fucking funnies.

384
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Well, we do laugh some about you.

385
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,200
Let's hear a belly giggle now, you cocksucker.

386
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,700
No.

387
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,000
God damn it!

388
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,600
Christ, that's one country ass-kicking!

389
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,500
Shut your fucking mouth!

390
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,600
Oh, he just 12-pointed slippery Dan.

391
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,600
Next one is to your head, Dan.

392
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,000
Do not doubt me.

393
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,400
Well, that's just fucking great.

394
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,500
That's fucking beautiful.

395
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,200
Feels like a cannonball up my ass.

396
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,600
Fella in Livingston went sweet on me.

397
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,800
Finnish fella from Finland,

398
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,700
hardly spoke fucking english.

399
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,300
Brought me flowers and
some dry food they like there.

400
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,400
And, uh, one night,

401
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,400
he takes my arm and he starts in

402
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,900
and he, uh, whispers in his finland accent,

403
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,000
"I want to suck your cock."

404
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,300
What do you fucking
think of that?

405
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,700
Uh, oh, I missed the end part, Jane.

406
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,100
Uh, can't practically hear fuck-all.

407
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,000
A fucking bullet near creased my ear.

408
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,700
It didn't do your face no fucking
favors neither.

409
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,500
- Yeah. 
- Put him to sleep.

410
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,800
I got to go.

411
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,600
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

412
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,100
Uh, wait.

413
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,800
- Let me get weapons.
- For what?

414
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,700
I told you, we was
involved in a falling out,

415
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,600
and I guess hostilities

416
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,500
may be about to resume.

417
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,000
You going to tell me now who it was with?

418
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,800
Swearengen.

419
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,700
The limey cocksucker
nearly did for the little one?

420
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,300
Why the fuck was you withholding
that information?

421
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,300
In the futile hope

422
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,700
of preventing you roiling the fucking waters.

423
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,700
How is that little one the limey
cocksucker nearly killed?

424
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,500
Still in the care
of the widow Garret?

425
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,300
I'll have my badge and gun back.

426
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,800
Well, go get the fucking weapons

427
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,500
for us to back him, Charlie.

428
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,400
Let me just wake my fucking watchman.

429
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Alcoholic encephalopathy.

430
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,600
Um... wet brain.

431
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,000
$5.00.

432
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Anything else I can do for you, boss?

433
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,800
Keep up.

434
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,500
Just save your fucking words, Al.

435
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,300
Don't waste your precious time.

436
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,900
You got any orders, you just send
Adams and he can deliver them.

437
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
- Dan--
- You chose!

438
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
You took his fucking part!

439
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,700
As was right and fucking proper at the time.

440
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,000
Yeah, but you pointed the fucking gun at me.

441
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,900
And persuaded you I'd use it in order
that I didn't need to.

442
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,100
Dan?

443
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,200
Where you or me would have
slammed that hoople up,

444
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
planted him back and twisted the cocksucker

445
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,800
till all the points of that buck's
rack showed out his chest,

446
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,900
and then done it twice more in case the fuck
mistook the first for accident,

447
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,600
what did Adams do?

448
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,600
He fucking walked away.

449
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,200
Different man from you and me.

450
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,400
Whatever looks ahead

451
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,400
of grievous abominations and disorder,

452
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,300
you and me walk into it together like always.

453
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,700
As you'd never say to Adams?

454
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,100
As I'd never say to Adams.

455
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,400
Send fucking Dolly up, huh?

456
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,800
Yeah, sure thing, boss.

457
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,300
When I first came to this camp

458
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,000
and for many years before,

459
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,400
I depended on spirits of laudanum.

460
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,000
May I ask against what indisposition?

461
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,700
Various indispositions.

462
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,700
The remedy was invariable.

463
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,700
Caring for Sophia has been a great joy

464
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,500
and a great freedom.

465
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,300
To give up her care

466
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,900
in love's name or any other

467
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,500
the selfishness of that...

468
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
i'd be too afraid.

469
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,300
Ain't never seen a man killed like that.

470
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,000
By God, I'll tell you what, Johnny,

471
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,800
there would have been a hell of a lot more

472
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,800
than two tines sticking through
that cocksucker's chest

473
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,700
if it had been me or al impaling him.

474
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,500
Jesus Christ!

475
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,200
Either Al got god

476
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,200
or Dolly just stuck her thumb
back up his ass.

477
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,100
Now, I'm halfway thinking

478
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,100
this exaggerates the condition
rather than alleviates it.

479
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
If I might should query the doc,

480
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,200
but then that cocksucker will
only ask after gleets.

481
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,900
Oh my God.

482
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,000
Take it out.

483
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,900
Take it out. Remove your fucking thumb.

484
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,800
Why,

485
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,900
if I was moving forward to get away from you,

486
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,100
would you have fucking pursued me?

487
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,300
When I stopped, pressed on yourself

488
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,500
to drive your thumb into my intestine?

489
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,100
Sorry.

490
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,800
Is it a river of blood,
or what the fuck's pouring out of it now?

491
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,700
Nothing.

492
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,600
Close the ass-flap.

493
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,600
The entire area of my fucking asshole

494
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,400
is now one gigantic fucking throb.

495
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,400
I have no idea what's transpiring in there.

496
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,500
- Shall I suck your prick? 
- Please.

497
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,600
Does he want to fucking die?

498
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,100
I understand that has its fucking appeal,

499
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
but not going out a fucking cunt

500
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,900
taking others fucking with you.

501
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,000
Dulled faculties!

502
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,000
Your fucking stupid fuck of a stupid
fucking partner.

503
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,100
Wants to die?

504
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,900
Help me, Trixie.

505
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,300
Even this now gives me no pleasure.

506
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,500
Swearengen!

507
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,100
Be down in five minutes
with my gun and badge!

508
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Start down now, you limey cocksucker!

509
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,500
Allow for getting stuck
crawling out from under the bed.

510
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,500
That Bullock's a fucking strategist, ain't he?

511
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Sets terms to publicly humiliate me,

512
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,300
and my penalty if I don't comply

513
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,300
is he walks into the bar downstairs
and takes 15 bullets in the chest.

514
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,200
And that ain't no hooplehead, you know.

515
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,600
Bullock, he's one of those
special fucking cases.

516
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,300
You don't know what in fuck's
going on in their mind.

517
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,400
And he's big with Montana.

518
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,600
Big.

519
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,100
I heard that today.

520
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,000
Because the news earlier from Yankton

521
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,700
and the fucking commissioners
wasn't adequately confusing.

522
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,300
Not to mention
the fucking telegraph coming in

523
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,500
and four whores that I don't
know who the fuck they work for.

524
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,900
Three minutes!

525
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,800
Shut the fuck up!

526
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,200
I suppose I do fucking understand.

527
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,900
So fucking confused and disgusted

528
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,900
and wanting it to end

529
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,200
and looking for the blessing
of a quick way out.

530
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,400
Sets himself to a higher fucking
standard than our natures,

531
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,300
- And he wants execution 'cause he's failed.
- One minute!

532
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,200
What the fuck happened to two?

533
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,600
Talk about one person

534
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,200
fucking up another person's entire fucking day.

535
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
Wait.

536
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,900
I had best go over.

537
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,700
Wait.

538
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,400
You linger awhile.

539
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,900
Do not think of thieving, huh?

540
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
Johnny,

541
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,400
produce that coal-oil-stinking suit.

542
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,000
Unless you'd rather get it for me.

543
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,800
I wish the fuck you two would

544
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,600
let me finish this the way I prefer.

545
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,500
Well, we wish to fuck you would find
something else to wish for.

546
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,700
Jesus Christ! I'm unarmed.

547
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,600
He's coming. He's detained.

548
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,500
- Getting dressed.
- Ain't it always a trial

549
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,400
picking out the gown best
conceals you fucking pissed yourself?

550
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,200
I recommend the six-shooter,

551
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,400
being this rifle's first recoil's

552
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,600
liable to knock you unconscious with pain.

553
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,400
Thank you.

554
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Selfish cocksucker.

555
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,400
That's not to say should the situation
deteriorate,

556
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,900
you boys wouldn't open fire
from concealment, huh?

557
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,400
Hardware Jew at less
than full force,

558
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,200
now they'll be fucking quaking.

559
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,500
I regret the delay. I was sequestered.

560
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,000
Have been, one thing and another,
since last we met.

561
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,600
I also apologize for the stink.

562
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,500
Welcome change
from your usual odor of skunk.

563
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,400
I offer these,

564
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,500
and I hope you'll wear them a good long
fucking time in this fucking camp,

565
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,400
whosever fucking thumb we're under.

566
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,300
And where it come to me
just a few moments ago

567
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,300
that the reverend
Smith,may he rest his soul,

568
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,900
he was found on the road,

569
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,500
apparently murdered by heathens
just some months ago.

570
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,200
What he said on the subject of you,

571
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,900
"Mr. Bullock raises a camp up,

572
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,900
"and I hope he'll reside with us

573
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,300
"and improve
our general fucking atmosphere

574
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,200
"for a good long fucking time,

575
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,200
"even with all the personal complications

576
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,900
"and fucking disasters
that we all fucking have,

577
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,000
"and where, running away

578
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,300
"solves absolutely fucking nothing."

579
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Did you find my hat?

580
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,800
Dolly!

581
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,100
Would you look
for the sheriff's hat?

582
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,400
Remember the reverend's half-dead face,

583
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,700
that cock-eyed look like he was the
victim of a lightning stroke, hmm?

584
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,700
May she sail it down or would
that be degrading?

585
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,700
- No.
- Toss it, Dolly.

586
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,100
I wish her aim
was as good with her thumb.

587
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,900
When the opportunity offers itself,

588
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,100
please return this to Mr. Bullock.

589
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,300
Yes, ma'am.

590
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,900
- Mr. Bullock.
- I don't want to talk about it.

591
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,600
As a practical matter,

592
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,500
self-censorship of the rigor which
obtains from this camp

593
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,800
so muzzles the press
as to make the first amendment

594
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,200
- a hollow superfluity.
- Thank you.

595
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,900
She can situate me.

596
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,200
All right.

597
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,900
The man says he's finished,
needs to get to his claim.

598
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,300
Four hours work, he's earned two bucks.

599
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,300
Says he wants to take it in pussy.

600
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,000
No, you want cash, Elmer,

601
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,300
to convert to pussy
at the Gem or Bella union.

602
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,200
All right, Joanie.

603
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,800
And let it be known in camp,

604
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,400
close to pussy as two bucks
will get a man in here

605
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,900
is a deep whiff walking past.

606
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,100
Hey, can I, uh, get one of those
and keep my money?

607
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,300
Have at it.

608
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,600
Fan some at him, Rosie, as he's leaving.

609
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,500
Mother, it's the ocean!

610
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,000
There's a rodent-looking creature
lamping one of your barrels.

611
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,800
Pay him no heed. That's the mayor.

612
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,200
You're tenacious, Merrick,
I'll fucking give you that.

613
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,900
Just tell me how it began.

614
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,700
After the conflict's genesis,

615
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,700
I'd lay it at cunt's doorstep.

616
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,600
Now, has cunt one "n" and two "t"s
or the other way around?

617
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,900
Jeez, Al.

618
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,100
You solicited the true account.

619
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,800
Within the limits of decency.

620
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,800
You want the decent truth, huh?

621
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,300
I choose to believe that
truth and decency need not be at odds.

622
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,800
Oh, you'll hear no argument from me.

623
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,300
Let it help me accumulate capital

624
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,600
or, at worst, not interfere,

625
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:55,400
the story is true and decent.

626
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,000
I would define as true and decent

627
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,600
in such endeavor, the facts rendered fully

628
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,400
within social standards and sensibilities

629
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,700
without bias or abridgement.

630
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,900
Why do I imagine a snake
swallowing its tail, huh?

631
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,300
Which is to say

632
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,800
the economic motive is but one strand

633
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,900
in the social tapestry my exemplary
account would weave.

634
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,400
Ass-fucking the dirt worshippers being another,

635
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,200
huh, as a pleasure beyond gain?

636
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,400
Now, now, now, now, I, uh...

637
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,500
Wait, was that your heathen imitation, huh?

638
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,200
Jump up and down a few times
and shout out "whoops,"

639
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,200
as in, "whoops, that ass-fucking hurts."

640
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,700
A more elevated perspective

641
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,200
would construe our conduct as white men

642
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,700
to be enacting a manifest destiny.

643
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,200
Whereas the warp, woof and fucking weave

644
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,000
of my story's tapestry

645
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,800
would foster the illusions of further
commerce, hmm?

646
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:05,200
"Tonight, throughout Deadwood

647
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:11,000
"heads may be laid to pillow

648
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,300

"In which connection, we

659
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,700
There you throw in the names
of a few businesses

660
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,700
gave you good-sized adverts, huh?

661
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,800
May I come in with my boots?

662
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,000
Of course.

663
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,200
You haven't slept?

664
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,700
I waited for you.

665
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,200
To show the boy when he awakes,

666
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,200
I've got these back.

667
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,400
I saw that you installed a bundling
board in the bed upstairs.

668
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,400
I did.

669
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,300
I hope you don't mind that I removed it.

670
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,200
No.

671
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,700
"A full fair-mindedness
