1
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:23,878
# My love went away far away

2
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:28,136
# When he was wanted

3
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,342
# Where's he tonight?

4
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:36,563
# Even I cannot say

5
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:40,650
# Away, far away

6
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:44,666
# For many a day

7
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:50,001
# Will we meet again?

8
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:55,110
# And who knows where or when?

9
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:58,836
# From here to Xian

10
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:03,707
# Many men have been wanted

11
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:08,137
# Who is the most wanted?

12
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:12,496
# My love, wanted by me

13
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:15,682
Come on, Pete, it'll soon be daylight
we've got a long ride to the ranch.

14
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:19,279
# Away, far away

15
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:22,803
# For many a day

16
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:28,049
# Will we meet again?

17
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:33,090
# And who knows where or when?

18
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:37,368
# From here to Xian

19
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:41,611
# Many men been wanted

20
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:47,250
# Who is the most wanted?

21
00:02:47,285 --> 00:02:52,194
# My love wanted by me

22
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:55,833
# Wanted

23
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:59,438
# Wanted

24
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:06,702
# He's wanted by me #

25
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:10,605
Kate can't hold them much longer.
We'd better get going.

26
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:33,679
Move along!

27
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:48,860
Get up son, get up!
- What's wrong, Pa?

28
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,466
Somebody's running off our herd.
Can't you hear it?

29
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:53,615
I'll go get Jack and Pete.

30
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:11,016
They didn't get back
from town yet, Pa.

31
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,265
Never mind, come on!

32
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,571
Hyah!

33
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,514
There, Father!

34
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:44,544
Hyah!

35
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:08,356
Hi, Ed. Johnny said you had
a letter for me.

36
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,668
Yeah, I have, O'Mara.

37
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:12,991
Didn't know where to forward it
so, I just hung onto it.

38
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:29,853
Bad news, kid?

39
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:40,300
If it's any comfort I can assure you

40
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:43,315
your father and brother where given
a decent Christian burials.

41
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,120
Thank you, Reverend.

42
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:51,166
Your father spoke of you often.
He was very proud of you.

43
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,695
I'm not very proud of myself.

44
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,802
Might have been different
if I'd stayed around here.

45
00:05:56,837 --> 00:05:59,450
Don't condemn yourself
for that, Clay.

46
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:02,706
These things happen without
any apparent reason.

47
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:05,928
We can't understand them,
we can only accept them.

48
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:28,787
What do you plan on doing now?

49
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:32,526
What would you do
if you were in my position?

50
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:35,457
That's a pretty difficult question.

51
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:40,557
Many people would be inclined
to seek some sort of retribution.

52
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:42,957
I'd have to advise against it.

53
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:45,198
Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord.

54
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,405
It's more or less
what I had in mind.

55
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,471
Yeah, but I'm not a minister.

56
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:53,397
I know that.
That's what disturbs me.

57
00:06:57,304 --> 00:07:00,501
Clay, do me a favour.

58
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,278
Think this thing over very carefully
before you take any action.

59
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:09,504
That's what I've been doing
ever since I left Denver.

60
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,801
Well, if there's anything
I can do to help.

61
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:14,937
I'd like to see the sheriff.

62
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:19,648
I was hoping you would say that.
Get in, I'll drive you over.

63
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:28,823
Come on, Buddy.

64
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,532
This is his place.
- Thanks a lot, Reverend.

65
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,374
Buddy. Come on.

66
00:07:58,499 --> 00:07:59,784
May I help you?

67
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:01,861
Yes.

68
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:08,345
That is, I was looking for
Sheriff Kenyon.

69
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,656
He's not here right now.
You might try his office.

70
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,589
I already did,

71
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:16,407
but they told me I might
find him at home.

72
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:20,765
He's hard to keep track of
sometimes, was it very important?

73
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,273
It's important to me.

74
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:24,695
I don't know what
to tell you except,

75
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,083
you might ask at the Cantina Felice.

76
00:08:27,118 --> 00:08:28,401
Thanks, I'll do that.

77
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:31,212
Or you can wait right here
if you like?

78
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:34,459
If you don't mind?

79
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:39,425
You're new in town, aren't you?
- Yes, ma'am, I am.

80
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,314
I'm sorry, I'm Laurie Kenyon,
the sheriff's my uncle.

81
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,124
I'm Clay O'Mara.

82
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:48,117
Oh, I'm sorry about your family.

83
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,493
Did you know them?

84
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:52,335
Not very well, I used
to see them at church.

85
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,363
You're from Denver, aren't you?
- Well, I work out of Denver.

86
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:58,942
On the railroad?
- That's right.

87
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:03,482
That must be very interesting work,
travelling from place to place.

88
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:05,565
I like it. Have you ever
been on a train?

89
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,286
No, but I'm going on one soon,
to San Francisco.

90
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:11,230
Oh? I just came back from there.

91
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:13,426
Is it really as wonderful
as they say it is?

92
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:15,127
Maybe even better.

93
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:18,006
If I knew when you were going,
I might be there at the same time.

94
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,814
I could show you some of the sights.

95
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:23,309
I'd like that but I'm afraid
my husband wouldn't.

96
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:27,064
You see, I'm getting married soon
and we plan to make our home there.

97
00:09:28,283 --> 00:09:31,036
Oh, I wish you a lot of happiness.

98
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,738
Thank you.

99
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:36,729
Well, if you show me
where the cantina...

100
00:09:36,764 --> 00:09:39,972
It's right on the main street,
you can't miss it.

101
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,015
Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

102
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:05,999
What's yours?

103
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:09,067
I was looking for Sheriff Kenyon.

104
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:12,955
You're looking the wrong way,
mister.

105
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,196
He's sitting over there.

106
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:17,738
Thanks.

107
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:22,906
Friend of yours?
- I never saw him before.

108
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:24,075
Sheriff Kenyon?

109
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,882
What is it?
- I'm Clay O'Mara.

110
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,803
Clay, I didn't know
you were in town.

111
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,164
This is Tom Meredith,
he was your father's lawyer.

112
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:35,475
Hi, it's a pleasure.
I've heard a great deal about you.

113
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,960
Sit down.

114
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,574
I suppose you got my letter.
- Yes, I did.

115
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:43,654
I'm sorry you didn't let me know
you were coming,

116
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:46,420
I could've saved you the trip,
the estate's been settled.

117
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:50,209
As a matter of fact, I have a bank
draft for you ready for the mail.

118
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:53,475
No, I didn't come
to settle the estate.

119
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,457
No?

120
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:56,653
No, I came to find out
who did the killing.

121
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:59,275
So far, we don't know.

122
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,569
Any ideas?

123
00:11:00,604 --> 00:11:04,005
All we know is, whoever did it
ran off with your dad's cattle.

124
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,983
This county's full of rustlers.

125
00:11:07,018 --> 00:11:10,203
Could you name me a few?
I'd like to talk to them.

126
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:12,956
They wouldn't talk to you, son.

127
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:15,749
They might if I was wearing
a deputy's badge.

128
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:18,548
What did you do for a living
before you came here?

129
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,004
Railroad surveyor.

130
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,414
Then go on back to it.
It's got a future.

131
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,202
I can't say the same for being
a deputy in this country.

132
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:27,058
I'm not asking you to.

133
00:11:27,093 --> 00:11:30,950
Furthermore, I don't hand out
tin stars as licences for murder.

134
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:34,595
I don't want to kill anyone,
I just want to talk to them.

135
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,205
Take my advice, get your money
from John and get out of town.

136
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:42,507
I guess that means
I don't get the badge?

137
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:43,748
That's right.

138
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:47,025
Well, in that case, I'll have to
get along the best way I can.

139
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,568
Be reasonable, son.

140
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:51,687
I've done everything anybody could
you're just asking for trouble.

141
00:11:51,722 --> 00:11:54,772
I'm not asking for trouble but I
might deal out a little of my own

142
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:56,399
when I find out what I want to know.

143
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:57,764
Wait a minute, Clay.

144
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,121
I think he's right, Fred,
he's entitled to ask questions

145
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:03,525
and it would help if
he were wearing a star.

146
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,084
Thanks, Mr Meredith.

147
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:07,523
That's all right, glad to
do anything I can to help.

148
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:09,928
Could you give me an idea
where to start looking?

149
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,675
I think maybe I can.

150
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,758
There's a man by the name of
Whitey Kincade

151
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:15,632
that's in trouble with the law.

152
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,431
Still have that reward poster, Fred?

153
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:20,861
I think I have.

154
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:24,571
Here it is.

155
00:12:27,907 --> 00:12:29,228
Where can I find him?

156
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:33,484
That will be a little hard but he
used to have a girl over in Diablo.

157
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,272
Might get a line on him there.

158
00:12:35,307 --> 00:12:36,568
Where's Diablo?

159
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:39,128
That's a few hours ride
east of here.

160
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:41,637
I'll be ready to go in an hour.

161
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:43,914
All right.

162
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:46,565
Stop by the office
and pick up a badge.

163
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:54,699
Whitey won't be very hard to find.
- I didn't think he would.

164
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:58,131
Kind of tough sending a kid
like him up against a gunman.

165
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,437
One thing I've always
liked about you, Fred,

166
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:02,201
you're sentimental.

167
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:16,643
Hello, Laurie.

168
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,503
Hello, Tom.

169
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:24,404
Uncle Fred, you didn't tell me
you made Clay a deputy.

170
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:26,057
I didn't think it was important.

171
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:27,282
Why'd you do it?

172
00:13:27,283 --> 00:13:29,205
He wanted some authority
to go looking for

173
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,915
whoever gunned his dad and brother.

174
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,564
Kincade didn't do it.

175
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:35,272
We can't be too sure of that,
Kincade's a killer.

176
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:37,204
He'll kill Clay, too.

177
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:40,049
That's a chance he has to take
if he wants to be a police officer.

178
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,471
Why are you so upset about it?

179
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:43,476
Well, it's...

180
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,773
I just think it's unfair

181
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:49,278
to send someone so young and
so inexperienced out after a...

182
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:50,610
He asked for it.

183
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:53,178
If he wants a man's job,
he has to do a man's work.

184
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:56,273
We both tried to talk him out of it.
There's no reasoning with him.

185
00:13:56,308 --> 00:13:58,816
Just the same, I think
it's disgraceful.

186
00:13:58,851 --> 00:14:01,284
You both ought to be ashamed
of yourselves!

187
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:04,197
I wouldn't worry, chances are
he won't even find Whitey.

188
00:14:04,232 --> 00:14:06,512
Come on, Laurie, I'll walk you home.

189
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:29,264
Can you feed and water my horse?

190
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:30,534
That I can.

191
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,970
Can you tell me where I can find
a Mr Whitey Kincade?

192
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:36,478
That I can't.

193
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:42,944
In case anybody's looking for me,
I'll be in the saloon.

194
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:19,240
You lost, sonny?

195
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:22,640
Maybe.

196
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:33,035
Is that for real?

197
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:35,496
Yeah, why?

198
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:39,103
Strangers don't ask questions in
Diablo, they just answer them.

199
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,336
What do you want here?

200
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:43,535
I'm waiting for somebody.

201
00:15:44,553 --> 00:15:46,157
Who is this somebody?

202
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,386
That's a question.

203
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:53,390
Whitey Kincade.

204
00:15:57,887 --> 00:16:01,391
If I was you, I'd be drinking
while I'm waiting.

205
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:06,604
See what he wants.

206
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:11,081
Name it.

207
00:16:11,116 --> 00:16:15,257
Can I just have some water?
- To drink?

208
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:17,548
Yeah.

209
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:28,707
Another badge for Whitey's
collection.

210
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,814
Looking for me?
- Are you Mr Kincade?

211
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:33,285
Skip the Mister,
everybody calls me Whitey.

212
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,556
I've got a warrant for you.
- Who ain't?

213
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:39,032
For the murder of Frank Whiteside.

214
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:43,083
That wasn't murder,
he had a gun in his hand!

215
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:45,612
I wonder how it got there.

216
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,877
Whiteside wasn't packing a gun.

217
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:51,564
A friend of mine put it there,
after I shot him.

218
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,501
We figured it would look better
in case I ever got arrested.

219
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:57,706
Good thing you thought of it.

220
00:17:57,741 --> 00:17:59,877
You're under arrest right now.

221
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,504
You hear that?

222
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:08,367
Well, what do I do now?

223
00:18:08,402 --> 00:18:11,405
I ain't never been arrested before.

224
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,654
Makes us even, I never arrested
anyone before.

225
00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:18,949
But you can start by putting
your gun on the bar.

226
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:22,129
You better high-tail it back where
you came from

227
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:24,422
before I stop laughing.

228
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,253
Put it on the bar.

229
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,204
Wasn't luck, boys.
Stay right where you are.

230
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:44,681
Yeah! Take it easy.

231
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:46,991
I don't want to see him
shoot an unarmed man.

232
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,138
Now what do we do?

233
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:52,210
We're heading for Santiago.
- Santiago?

234
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,513
Relax, Larry.

235
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:55,919
Me and um...

236
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:58,441
I didn't get your name.
- O'Mara.

237
00:18:58,476 --> 00:19:01,047
Me and O'Mara got a nice little
trip ahead of us,

238
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:04,128
and one of us is just
liable not to make it.

239
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,566
This is a good a spot as any.
- What for?

240
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:39,095
A smoke.

241
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:47,354
A smoke.

242
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:49,779
You mean my arresting you?

243
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:53,170
Yeah, you trying to make
yourself a reputation

244
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:55,151
or you just trying to ruin mine?

245
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:57,056
I'm only interested in one thing,

246
00:19:57,091 --> 00:20:00,436
that's finding the cattle rustlers
who shot my dad and brother.

247
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:04,125
Cattle rustlers?
You think I'm a thief?

248
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,266
I think you know the answer to
some questions I have in mind.

249
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:11,396
You picked on the wrong party.
- Not what I heard.

250
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:13,332
Who you been talking to, kid?

251
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:17,497
A lawyer in San Diego by the name of
Meredith and Sheriff Kenyon.

252
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:21,532
Kenyon, did he send you after me?

253
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,258
Yeah.

254
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:26,456
There's a man who knows how to play
both ends against the middle.

255
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,155
What do you mean?

256
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:34,012
We got something in common, kid.
We've both been framed.

257
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:36,458
That doesn't make sense to me.

258
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:37,891
It does to me.

259
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:40,952
Kenyon's going to be the most
surprised man in the county,

260
00:20:40,987 --> 00:20:42,748
if you bring me in.

261
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,510
When I bring you in.

262
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:49,417
You've got a right
to your own opinion.

263
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:52,483
So, you figure I know who
killed your folks, huh?

264
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,487
That's what I was told.

265
00:20:54,522 --> 00:20:56,831
Is that why didn't kill me
back in the saloon?

266
00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:59,693
That's part of it.
- What's the rest?

267
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:02,337
There used to be a marshal
up in Colorado.

268
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:05,637
He told me any police officer
can bring in a dead man,

269
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:08,119
the trick is to bring him in alive.

270
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:11,621
And what happened to that marshal?

271
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:15,781
He was killed trying the trick
once too often.

272
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,549
That could happen to you.

273
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:20,688
Don't gamble on it.

274
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:23,735
Relax, I'm not sore
because you grabbed me.

275
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,955
As a matter of fact,
I'm growing real fond of you.

276
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:33,170
I'm even considering
making you a deal.

277
00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:37,032
You offer it, I might consider it.

278
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:38,609
Take these off of me

279
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:41,078
and I'll put them on the party
you're looking for.

280
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:42,438
Uh-uh.

281
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:44,901
I'm as good as my word,
sometimes better.

282
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,330
I thought you didn't know
anything about it.

283
00:21:47,365 --> 00:21:51,988
I don't, but I got ways
of finding out.

284
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:55,966
Don't let that tin star
go to your head.

285
00:21:57,698 --> 00:21:59,978
I happen to have regard
for the law, Whitey.

286
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:05,076
There's only one law around here,
'Get yours while the getting's good'

287
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:06,449
there ain't other law!

288
00:22:06,484 --> 00:22:08,918
You're forgetting the one
that'll hang you.

289
00:22:11,037 --> 00:22:13,312
You're still wet behind the ears.

290
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:19,880
I'm growing real fond of you.

291
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,430
Hey! What are you trying to do?

292
00:22:34,606 --> 00:22:37,224
You were just telling me
how much you liked me.

293
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:41,093
That's the truth, the gospel truth,
so help me Hannah!

294
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,416
You're sure set on
taking me back alive!

295
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:30,433
Who's the reception party?
- Oh, probably some of my friends.

296
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,519
Friends, huh?

297
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:49,776
What have they got against us?

298
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:52,942
If it's who I think it is,
one of them's got a sister.

299
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:56,073
A man could get real unpopular
associating with you.

300
00:23:56,108 --> 00:23:58,377
She was a real nice girl, too.

301
00:23:58,412 --> 00:24:01,368
I hope so, it looks like
I'm going to get shot for it.

302
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:04,324
If you need any help you can always
give me back my gun.

303
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,494
Uh-uh.

304
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:07,827
What's the matter,
don't you trust me?

305
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:09,053
Uh-uh.

306
00:24:09,088 --> 00:24:11,659
You might get to like me
real well again.

307
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:27,972
They're making a run for it.

308
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:33,664
Ain't you going to shoot them?
- Not in the back.

309
00:24:33,699 --> 00:24:36,682
It's safer that way, they can't
shoot back at you.

310
00:24:36,717 --> 00:24:38,777
I don't fight that way.

311
00:24:40,683 --> 00:24:43,614
I don't know where
you were brought up, kid

312
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,546
but wherever it was,
you were brought up wrong.

313
00:24:50,195 --> 00:24:52,538
It looks like one of us
is going to have to walk.

314
00:24:52,573 --> 00:24:54,598
You going to guess which one?

315
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:58,160
From the way you do everything else,
I figured it will be you.

316
00:24:58,195 --> 00:25:00,113
Guess again, Whitey.

317
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:05,019
That's the trouble with you,
you ain't consistent!

318
00:25:20,746 --> 00:25:23,973
Here comes our man, he's bringing in
Whitey Kincade.

319
00:25:24,008 --> 00:25:29,275
Hey, men! O'Mara's back and
he's got Whitey Kincade with him!

320
00:25:34,782 --> 00:25:36,898
Looks like you're pretty popular
in this town.

321
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,638
I'm more popular away from it.

322
00:25:38,673 --> 00:25:41,380
You could get elected Mayor
for bringing me in.

323
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:42,915
Who wants to be mayor?

324
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,168
Right now I wouldn't mind it.

325
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:58,626
Yeah, he got me!

326
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,026
Howdy!

327
00:26:06,822 --> 00:26:09,905
Hey! How you doing?

328
00:26:14,076 --> 00:26:15,722
Kate, I don't believe it.

329
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:18,228
I wouldn't have missed this
for anything.

330
00:26:18,263 --> 00:26:22,575
I've waited a long time to see
Whitey Kincade get cut down to size.

331
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:28,370
Right cosy place you got here.

332
00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:31,356
I heard you got home cooking, too.

333
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:33,499
I sure hope it's good.

334
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,946
You won't be here long enough
to get tired of it.

335
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:44,844
Now then, son.

336
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:47,518
Do you mind telling us
how you managed to do it?

337
00:26:47,553 --> 00:26:49,169
I beat him to the draw.

338
00:26:49,204 --> 00:26:50,785
Maybe you were just lucky?

339
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,503
Maybe.

340
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:54,781
Whitey has a fair reputation
as a gunman.

341
00:26:54,816 --> 00:26:57,205
It might have helped if you'd
told me that before.

342
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,600
I thought you knew what
you were doing, son!

343
00:26:59,635 --> 00:27:01,960
Everybody around here
knows Whitey Kincade.

344
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,945
I know him now.

345
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,495
From now on, he'll know you too as
the guy that brought him in.

346
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,050
That's a reputation
I wouldn't want to have.

347
00:27:10,085 --> 00:27:12,455
It's like digging your own grave!

348
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,029
Did you have anything to eat, son?
- No, not since morning.

349
00:27:17,064 --> 00:27:20,136
Go to my house and have my niece
fix a meal for you and Whitey.

350
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:23,825
We'll have to feed him
till we can hang him.

351
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:36,967
Looks like we guessed wrong
on the boy.

352
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:38,587
Yeah.

353
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:41,386
What am I supposed to
do with him now?

354
00:27:41,421 --> 00:27:42,860
Get rid of him.

355
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:46,035
How?
- I'll leave that up to you.

356
00:27:47,514 --> 00:27:49,374
You killed his father
and his brother,

357
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:51,411
you may as well take care
of this one, too.

358
00:27:51,446 --> 00:27:53,630
This one is your concern, Fred.

359
00:27:53,665 --> 00:27:55,773
He won't be and he ever finds out

360
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:58,515
that you're the party
to come looking for...

361
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,686
He won't find out.

362
00:28:01,602 --> 00:28:03,577
O'Mara isn't afraid
of taking chances.

363
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:07,571
All you have to do is see to it
that he takes one too many.

364
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,910
Just a minute!

365
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,358
Clay!
- Hello.

366
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:22,664
Come in!

367
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,363
I never expected to see you again.

368
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:30,231
Your uncle sent me to fetch
some food for Mr Kincade.

369
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:31,597
Whitey Kincade?

370
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:33,441
Yeah, he's starved, so am I.

371
00:28:33,476 --> 00:28:35,396
I don't believe it!

372
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:37,365
We haven't eaten since this morning.

373
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,683
How'd you do it?

374
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,738
We just tightened our belts.

375
00:28:40,773 --> 00:28:44,891
Well, if you're so clever,
you can help me cook.

376
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:47,496
I can do that, too.

377
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,246
I thought we had a deal?

378
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:59,797
We do. I operate in Santiago,
you operate in Diablo.

379
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:01,959
Why did you send the kid
over there to arrest me?

380
00:29:01,994 --> 00:29:03,545
There was no stopping him.

381
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,489
What's more, I never figured on him
beating you to the draw.

382
00:29:06,524 --> 00:29:10,108
Next time you send somebody after me
make sure he can't shoot first.

383
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:11,499
You ain't hurt, Whitey.

384
00:29:11,534 --> 00:29:12,816
What am I doing in jail?

385
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,524
Stop worrying, there will be
a trial in the morning.

386
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,970
Is that supposed to make me happy?

387
00:29:18,005 --> 00:29:20,815
I understand capital punishment's
legal in this county.

388
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,134
You won't be here.

389
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:23,648
Where am I going to be?

390
00:29:23,683 --> 00:29:25,377
Anywhere you like.

391
00:29:27,164 --> 00:29:29,724
You can shoot your way
out of here tonight.

392
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:33,798
Who am I going to shoot,
Clay O'Mara?

393
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:38,577
Maybe, unless you give him another
chance to outdraw you!

394
00:29:41,063 --> 00:29:45,098
Just a minute, Sheriff.
I just thought of an easier way.

395
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:49,627
Get me a witness who will say that
I killed Whiteside in self-defence.

396
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,369
Why bother?
I'm giving you a way out.

397
00:29:53,686 --> 00:29:55,859
I know a guy who broke jail once,

398
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,968
he got shot in the back.

399
00:29:58,003 --> 00:30:00,551
Do you think I'd double cross you?

400
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:01,565
Yes.

401
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,613
I wouldn't trust a jury if my name
was Whitey Kincade.

402
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:08,163
I got a lot of confidence in you,
as long as I can still talk.

403
00:30:08,198 --> 00:30:10,730
The jury might hang me
but I'll hang you first.

404
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:13,218
I didn't bring you in, O'Mara did.

405
00:30:13,253 --> 00:30:17,007
If anything goes wrong at that trial
I might get O'Mara, too.

406
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:19,375
Right in the back.

407
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,939
What's so funny?

408
00:30:29,974 --> 00:30:33,808
Oh, kid! I wish I could tell you
but you're too young to hear it!

409
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,141
Stay away from her!

410
00:32:07,317 --> 00:32:10,309
Ringer! That's enough of that.

411
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:18,212
Why don't you stay out of trouble?
- They were mauling Kate.

412
00:32:18,247 --> 00:32:21,008
I want you to lay off the bottle
for a couple of days.

413
00:32:21,043 --> 00:32:22,967
Sounds like you need me
for something.

414
00:32:23,002 --> 00:32:25,550
Yeah, you're appearing in court
tomorrow morning.

415
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:27,862
Court? Are you crazy?
- Shut up and listen.

416
00:32:27,897 --> 00:32:30,570
You're appearing as a defence
witness for Whitey Kincade.

417
00:32:30,605 --> 00:32:33,167
Why should I defend him?
I hope they hang him.

418
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,159
You'll hang right alongside him
if they do.

419
00:32:35,194 --> 00:32:36,896
He knows enough to ruin us all.

420
00:32:36,931 --> 00:32:39,729
He won't mind talking if he
doesn't like the verdict.

421
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:43,642
I'm not going to lie for nothing.

422
00:32:43,677 --> 00:32:45,713
You've been lying for
nothing all your life.

423
00:32:45,748 --> 00:32:47,217
Once more won't hurt you.

424
00:32:47,252 --> 00:32:50,073
You know Sheriff, one of these days
I'm going to surprise you.

425
00:32:50,108 --> 00:32:52,895
The only way you could surprise me
would be to quit drinking.

426
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,787
Meredith will be around tonight.
- With some cash?

427
00:32:56,795 --> 00:33:00,037
With a little speech you're
going to make in court.

428
00:33:49,381 --> 00:33:51,138
You want something?

429
00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:54,153
Yeah, I want some company.
I'm lonesome.

430
00:33:54,188 --> 00:33:55,721
Go on back to bed.

431
00:33:55,756 --> 00:33:59,136
I can't sleep. Too much on my mind.

432
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:02,891
That figures, they can only
hang you once!

433
00:34:02,926 --> 00:34:05,385
But that once can be
awful permanent.

434
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,844
Is there a bottle of whiskey around?

435
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,414
I wouldn't know.

436
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:12,452
How about going across the street
and getting me one?

437
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:18,621
You're in jail, not a hotel.

438
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,966
If I was in a hotel, I'd ask you
for more than whiskey.

439
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:26,163
You got a girl, kid?
- No.

440
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:28,482
Like some advice?
- About girls?

441
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:31,052
I was thinking about something else.

442
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:33,490
Look, you nabbed the notorious
Whitey Kincade.

443
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:35,854
Why don't you quit
while you're still ahead?

444
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:39,325
I didn't come here to go gunning
for you, Whitey.

445
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,019
You're up against a cold deck, kid.

446
00:34:43,054 --> 00:34:47,115
Go on back to Colorado and don't
run after nothing but women.

447
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:50,290
You got some reason for saying that?

448
00:34:50,325 --> 00:34:53,035
Yeah, I'm sentimental.

449
00:34:54,786 --> 00:34:56,104
You're a good kid.

450
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:59,495
But you're going to bullet in
the back if you stay around here.

451
00:35:06,509 --> 00:35:09,649
Who's going to do it, Whitey?
- That's a good question.

452
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:13,358
But I can't give you the answer
until tomorrow.

453
00:35:23,793 --> 00:35:25,294
Not guilty!

454
00:35:25,855 --> 00:35:27,684
The verdict is not guilty!

455
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:30,791
Good verdict!
- I think he ought to have been hung.

456
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:36,896
Stick around, Clay, I want you to
escort Kincade out of town.

457
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:43,448
You look put-out, Clay.

458
00:35:43,548 --> 00:35:46,051
I am, I don't understand the verdict,

459
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:48,555
especially with you being foreman
of the jury.

460
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,933
You heard Ringer testify Kincade
shot Mr Whiteside in self-defence.

461
00:35:51,968 --> 00:35:55,276
I didn't believe him, I don't see how
you or the jury could either.

462
00:35:55,311 --> 00:35:57,813
I held out for a verdict of guilty
until it was pointed out

463
00:35:57,848 --> 00:35:59,454
that Mr Ringer had sworn
on the bible

464
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:01,810
to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

465
00:36:01,845 --> 00:36:03,612
As a minister,
I couldn't ignore that.

466
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:06,086
No, I guess you couldn't.

467
00:36:06,815 --> 00:36:11,172
We're having a church social at my
house tonight why don't you drop by?

468
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:13,252
Thanks, Reverend. Maybe I will.

469
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:15,166
I'll see you there.

470
00:36:23,984 --> 00:36:26,072
Kate, you look real pretty.

471
00:36:26,107 --> 00:36:29,076
That gal with the corn silk hair,
the one I threw you over for.

472
00:36:29,111 --> 00:36:30,970
She don't look pretty no more.

473
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:33,701
You'd look better to me
with a noose around your neck.

474
00:36:33,736 --> 00:36:36,933
You should have told that to your
boyfriend before the trial.

475
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:38,233
I did.

476
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:42,574
Oh, join the revival meeting,
you know these gents, don't you?

477
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:43,816
I met Mr Meredith.

478
00:36:43,851 --> 00:36:46,604
Shake hands with the gent who did
the reviving, Jed Ringer.

479
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,848
I didn't catch the name.
- It's O'Mara.

480
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:50,374
Oh, yeah. I heard about you.

481
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:53,674
Of course you heard about him, he's
the one who beat me to the draw!

482
00:36:53,709 --> 00:36:56,054
Drink up, kid, drink up.

483
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,123
No thanks.

484
00:36:57,158 --> 00:36:59,911
You know it ain't polite to stare.

485
00:37:01,164 --> 00:37:04,088
Not even at the star witness?
- What's your objection?

486
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:06,731
Just thinking, it's probably
the first time

487
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,735
anyone ever shot an unarmed man
in self-defence.

488
00:37:10,516 --> 00:37:13,804
The trial's over, it's futile
to argue points of law now.

489
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,493
Anyway, what do you know about it?

490
00:37:15,528 --> 00:37:18,201
Just what I heard from a man who was
on one end of the shooting.

491
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,175
He means me, ain't that rich?

492
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,077
Are you admitting that
Ringer lied to the court?

493
00:37:23,112 --> 00:37:24,284
Are you or ain't you?

494
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:29,109
Well, now that you bring
the point up, I am.

495
00:37:42,286 --> 00:37:44,527
That's the way it is
with revival meetings,

496
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,934
somebody's always
getting the spirit.

497
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:48,135
Let's go.

498
00:38:01,452 --> 00:38:04,535
This is as far as I can go,
here's your gun.

499
00:38:08,824 --> 00:38:10,371
It's loaded!

500
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:13,431
Wouldn't do you much good empty.

501
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:16,879
Listen, kid, you're talking to
Whitey Kincade.

502
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:19,128
Nobody hands me loaded guns.

503
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,298
I shoot people in the back.

504
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:24,575
All you got to do is pull the trigger
when I head back for town.

505
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:26,707
I got a real good reason to.

506
00:38:26,742 --> 00:38:30,462
Sure! I ruined your reputation
as a gunslinger.

507
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:35,066
How did you ever manage
to live this long?

508
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:38,560
If I was smart,
I'd shoot you right now.

509
00:38:39,844 --> 00:38:42,278
Except, I think I'll keep you
around for a while,

510
00:38:42,313 --> 00:38:44,621
just to see what makes you work.

511
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,893
Maybe you're getting soft, Whitey.

512
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:49,209
Maybe you're turning into
a human being!

513
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:52,099
If I ever feel that coming on,
I'll shoot myself.

514
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,697
So long, kid.

515
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,255
So long, Whitey.

516
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,105
I'll leave you with a little advice.

517
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,438
Don't ever turn your back
on Jed Ringer.

518
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:03,839
Could he be one of the reasons
that brought me to Santiago?

519
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:06,228
He's a good bet.

520
00:39:06,987 --> 00:39:08,443
Know any others?

521
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:10,282
Oh...

522
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:12,107
...yeah.

523
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,882
Sheriff Kenyon.

524
00:39:16,912 --> 00:39:18,834
I guess you got to have your joke.

525
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:22,207
Sure, but that ain't it!

526
00:39:24,301 --> 00:39:25,916
I'll keep it in mind.

527
00:40:19,991 --> 00:40:21,500
I'm Whitey Kincade.

528
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:23,009
Draw on him, Clay!

529
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:31,573
Why didn't you draw, Clay?

530
00:40:31,608 --> 00:40:35,192
Because I was scared, that's why.
- You ain't scared of anything!

531
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:37,341
Imagine him being scared!

532
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,806
Excuse me. Can I speak with you, Tom?
- Surely.

533
00:40:58,927 --> 00:41:01,680
Laurie, you must forgive me,
something urgent has come up.

534
00:41:01,715 --> 00:41:04,503
I'll try rush right back.
- All right.

535
00:41:09,163 --> 00:41:11,108
Would you men excuse me for a minute?

536
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:12,912
Sure!

537
00:41:39,451 --> 00:41:41,605
Hello!
- Hi.

538
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,488
I haven't seen you
out there dancing.

539
00:41:43,523 --> 00:41:45,296
I don't have anyone to dance with.

540
00:41:45,331 --> 00:41:48,516
You can ask someone.
A girl can't very well ask you!

541
00:41:48,551 --> 00:41:50,968
I guess I'm just bashful.

542
00:41:51,003 --> 00:41:54,268
I know a girl who isn't dancing
right now and her escort isn't here.

543
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,191
Well, it wouldn't look very nice

544
00:41:56,226 --> 00:41:58,933
for her to be dancing with
strangers then, would it?

545
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,463
I guess it wouldn't.

546
00:42:01,498 --> 00:42:05,286
Besides, if she asks you, you would
probably think she was forward.

547
00:42:05,321 --> 00:42:06,870
I probably would.

548
00:42:06,905 --> 00:42:08,600
Do you like forward girls?

549
00:42:08,635 --> 00:42:09,694
I don't know any.

550
00:42:09,729 --> 00:42:12,380
I think they're pretty
dreadful myself.

551
00:42:12,415 --> 00:42:15,669
Oh, would you care to dance?

552
00:42:43,081 --> 00:42:45,595
Come in, Tom.
- What's the trouble?

553
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,417
Silver Bullion.

554
00:42:47,452 --> 00:42:49,989
I got word from Wells Fargo
tonight about the shipment.

555
00:42:50,024 --> 00:42:51,407
They changed the time?

556
00:42:51,442 --> 00:42:54,161
And the route, we've got to
map out a new plan.

557
00:42:58,925 --> 00:43:01,814
Miss Kenyon,
she's a very charming girl.

558
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:06,824
I'm just wondering about her uncle.
- What's your opinion of him?

559
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:09,255
I was just about to ask you
the same thing.

560
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:11,864
Fred Kenyon?

561
00:43:11,899 --> 00:43:16,763
He's always struck me as a kind of
an unhappy, disappointed man.

562
00:43:16,798 --> 00:43:21,627
The job he as here is difficult,
thankless, the pay is poor.

563
00:43:22,788 --> 00:43:25,484
Has anyone ever questioned
his honesty?

564
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,731
Why do you ask?
- I heard talk.

565
00:43:28,766 --> 00:43:32,406
Clay, there's always talk,
even about ministers of the gospel.

566
00:43:32,441 --> 00:43:34,982
Yeah, I guess you're right.

567
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:37,604
It was a lovely dance.

568
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:40,264
I'm pleased you and the others
enjoyed yourselves.

569
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:42,889
Clay, would you mind
walking Miss Kenyon home?

570
00:43:42,924 --> 00:43:45,024
Not at all.

571
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:47,755
Good night.
- Good night.

572
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:57,610
You didn't have to do it, you know.

573
00:43:57,645 --> 00:44:00,215
Do what?
- Walk me home.

574
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,515
I know the way very well and
I'm not afraid of the dark.

575
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,798
I don't mind.

576
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:08,735
In that case, you won't mind if I
walk the rest of the way by myself.

577
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,649
What are you so mad about?

578
00:44:10,684 --> 00:44:11,947
I've been insulted.

579
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,792
Who did it? I'll see if
I can get him to apologise.

580
00:44:14,827 --> 00:44:16,630
You can start right now.

581
00:44:17,942 --> 00:44:19,251
Are you talking about me?

582
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:21,584
Naturally, you're the only one here,
aren't you?

583
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:23,491
I didn't do anything.

584
00:44:23,526 --> 00:44:25,507
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

585
00:44:25,542 --> 00:44:28,295
I had to throw myself at you
to get you to ask me to dance

586
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,020
and then you walk me home
and won't even talk to me.

587
00:44:31,055 --> 00:44:35,674
I'd be wasting my time if I got
too interested, wouldn't I?

588
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,208
I don't see why.

589
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:40,723
I understood you were
engaged to Tom Meredith.

590
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:42,358
What difference does that make?

591
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:44,575
I've known people
to get awfully jealous

592
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:47,687
if someone paid too much
attention to their girl.

593
00:44:47,722 --> 00:44:50,764
Tom's not the jealous type,
besides he wasn't there.

594
00:44:52,127 --> 00:44:56,279
He isn't here now, either.
- I didn't think you'd noticed!

595
00:44:56,314 --> 00:44:59,507
You know what I'd do
if you belonged to me?

596
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:01,148
What?

597
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:13,722
You tell Meredith if he isn't
jealous, he's a halfwit.

598
00:45:14,615 --> 00:45:15,971
Clay.

599
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:17,327
Yes?

600
00:45:20,946 --> 00:45:22,686
That is, I...

601
00:45:24,951 --> 00:45:27,215
I don't know what I'm doing!

602
00:45:35,634 --> 00:45:37,670
Have a good time at the dance?

603
00:45:39,439 --> 00:45:40,853
Yes, I...

604
00:45:40,888 --> 00:45:42,232
I did!

605
00:45:42,267 --> 00:45:43,930
A simply wonderful time.

606
00:45:43,965 --> 00:45:45,594
Laurie, what's wrong?

607
00:45:45,629 --> 00:45:47,505
You should know.

608
00:45:49,365 --> 00:45:51,901
You didn't even come back
to call for me.

609
00:45:51,936 --> 00:45:55,531
I had to come home with Clay O'Mara.
- I thought you liked young O'Mara?

610
00:45:55,566 --> 00:45:57,916
I do, that's the trouble.

611
00:45:57,951 --> 00:46:01,307
He kissed me goodnight,
I liked it.

612
00:46:04,374 --> 00:46:08,037
He said if you weren't jealous
of me, you're a halfwit.

613
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:11,266
I'm beginning to think he's right.

614
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:14,783
You don't mean that, Laurie.
- I'm afraid I do.

615
00:46:14,818 --> 00:46:18,254
Let it go, Tom, let her think
about it through tomorrow.

616
00:46:18,997 --> 00:46:20,771
Goodnight, Laurie.

617
00:46:30,381 --> 00:46:32,804
I'd like an explanation, Laurie.

618
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,406
So would I.

619
00:46:37,206 --> 00:46:40,733
I don't know how it happened,
I didn't want it to happen.

620
00:46:40,768 --> 00:46:42,804
But it did.

621
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,717
You really think you're in love
with Clay?

622
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:47,973
Yes.

623
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:52,388
Listen to me Laurie, forget Clay
and save yourself a lot of grief.

624
00:46:52,423 --> 00:46:53,319
Why?

625
00:46:53,354 --> 00:46:56,699
I've seen kids like him time
and again in every boom town.

626
00:46:56,734 --> 00:47:01,150
He's out for revenge,
headed straight for boot hill.

627
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:24,901
Where's the sheriff?
- He's not in right now.

628
00:47:24,936 --> 00:47:27,824
When do you expect him back?
- He didn't say, can I help you?

629
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:31,044
What can you do? I need a posse.
My white stallion's been stolen.

630
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:32,768
It cost me $10000!

631
00:47:32,803 --> 00:47:34,471
When did you see him last?

632
00:47:34,506 --> 00:47:37,737
My stable boy saw somebody riding
toward Diablo this morning.

633
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,376
Why didn't you go after him?

634
00:47:39,411 --> 00:47:42,528
In the first place, my stallion is
the fastest horse in the South West!

635
00:47:42,563 --> 00:47:43,733
In the second place,

636
00:47:43,768 --> 00:47:46,168
catching horse thieves
is a Sheriff's job, not mine!

637
00:47:46,203 --> 00:47:48,521
Now, can you raise a posse
or can't you?

638
00:47:48,556 --> 00:47:52,890
I think I can take care of that.
- Who you taking with you?

639
00:47:52,925 --> 00:47:54,010
Nobody.

640
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:56,491
You mean you're going alone,
just one man?

641
00:47:56,526 --> 00:47:58,674
He only stole one horse, didn't he?

642
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:20,705
Kenyon push you into this?
- He doesn't even know I'm here.

643
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,061
Don't take any bets on it?

644
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:25,781
How about this horse?

645
00:48:25,816 --> 00:48:28,444
Matt Grove's stallion, huh?

646
00:48:28,479 --> 00:48:30,540
A real white beauty.

647
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:32,815
Fast as the wind.

648
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,944
I wish I'd stole it!

649
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:37,038
Any idea who did?

650
00:48:37,073 --> 00:48:39,481
Any reward?

651
00:48:39,986 --> 00:48:41,403
Grove didn't say.

652
00:48:41,438 --> 00:48:44,828
Sorry, I don't inform on my friends.

653
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:48,376
I'd like to meet them.

654
00:48:48,411 --> 00:48:51,995
You going to be hanging
around Diablo a while?

655
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,546
It appears likely.

656
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:57,438
I got a friend named Rosita and
she's got a friend named Sally.

657
00:48:57,473 --> 00:48:58,874
You're informing!

658
00:49:00,613 --> 00:49:04,447
Maybe you'd like to see some
cattle ranches around here?

659
00:49:04,482 --> 00:49:07,068
That I would.
- Come on, I'll show you.

660
00:49:07,103 --> 00:49:08,945
Thanks, Whitey.

661
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,564
Don't thank me, I'd probably be
thanking you or one of my friends

662
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:14,830
for a very interesting afternoon!

663
00:49:52,462 --> 00:49:56,580
Any relation to the Lowerie gang?
- No relation, this is them.

664
00:50:14,246 --> 00:50:17,397
Say hello to Clay O'Mara.
- What are you doing here?

665
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:19,206
I was showing Clay around

666
00:50:19,241 --> 00:50:21,476
and I figured he ought to see
the Lowerie ranch.

667
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:23,776
Yeah, it's a pretty nice spread
you got here.

668
00:50:23,811 --> 00:50:26,004
They had to steal a lot
of cows to get it!

669
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:28,735
I'm not interested in cows,
I'm interested in horses.

670
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,445
Any horse in particular?

671
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,108
Yeah, the white stallion out there.

672
00:50:35,948 --> 00:50:38,175
You can buy him for $1,000.

673
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:40,402
Matt Grove says he's worth ten.

674
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,615
How would he know?

675
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:45,847
Because he happens to own the only
white stallion in these parts.

676
00:50:45,882 --> 00:50:47,446
That's him.

677
00:51:05,705 --> 00:51:08,258
Relax boys, he's your guest.

678
00:51:08,293 --> 00:51:11,924
Maybe you ought to make up your mind
whose side you're on, Whitey.

679
00:51:11,959 --> 00:51:15,556
I'm on my side, right now I'm
looking for a little excitement.

680
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:32,065
I'm sure Mr Grove would be glad
to get his horse back.

681
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,646
Where did you say you found him?
- I said I bought him.

682
00:51:34,681 --> 00:51:36,566
You better ask for your money back.

683
00:51:36,601 --> 00:51:39,456
I think the man who sold him
to you is dishonest.

684
00:51:39,491 --> 00:51:41,322
Thanks for the sightseeing tour.

685
00:51:41,357 --> 00:51:44,315
Like I said before,
don't thank me yet.

686
00:51:54,265 --> 00:51:55,667
Uh-uh!

687
00:51:55,702 --> 00:51:59,058
When he gets past your trespassing
sign you can start after him.

688
00:51:59,093 --> 00:52:02,137
It ain't exciting enough to see
a man shot in the back.

689
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,767
Saddle up.

693
00:53:31,302 --> 00:53:32,663
Well, Tom.

694
00:53:32,698 --> 00:53:34,890
No word from O'Mara?

695
00:53:34,925 --> 00:53:37,450
I expect to get word
about him not from him.

696
00:53:44,195 --> 00:53:46,599
What do you want?
- I want some money.

697
00:53:46,634 --> 00:53:49,004
I told you to stay out
of this office.

698
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:51,453
This won't wait. I need $200.

699
00:53:51,488 --> 00:53:54,131
Sorry Jed, you already got
all that's coming to you.

700
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:56,775
I stole Grove's stallion,
that ought to be worth extra.

701
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:57,772
You got paid for it!

702
00:53:57,807 --> 00:54:00,154
Not enough, I'm tired of doing
dirty work for no pay.

703
00:54:00,189 --> 00:54:02,464
From now I'm going to get my share
the same as you.

704
00:54:02,499 --> 00:54:06,174
From now on, you'll take whatever
we want to give you, get out.

705
00:54:10,624 --> 00:54:12,166
Throw him in a cell.

706
00:54:12,201 --> 00:54:13,964
Take it easy, we still need him.

707
00:54:21,823 --> 00:54:23,450
Looks like he's hurt.

708
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,409
He must have run into trouble.

709
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:43,904
I'm Doc Hiatt.

710
00:54:43,939 --> 00:54:47,263
I didn't want you to mistake me
for the Archangel Michael.

711
00:54:47,298 --> 00:54:50,588
You don't look much like any of
the pictures I've seen of him.

712
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,549
Hi, Laurie.

713
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:53,783
Hi.

714
00:54:53,818 --> 00:54:55,615
How do you feel?

715
00:54:57,823 --> 00:54:59,324
Care to dance?

716
00:55:00,966 --> 00:55:02,752
Save the next one for me, will you?

717
00:55:02,753 --> 00:55:05,859
Make it a nice slow waltz till he
gets on his feet again.

718
00:55:05,894 --> 00:55:07,930
Young man, there's nothing
wrong with you,

719
00:55:07,965 --> 00:55:09,756
except you lost a lot of blood.

720
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:12,052
A little rest will
take care of that.

721
00:55:12,087 --> 00:55:14,314
I'll take good care of him, Doctor.

722
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,434
If I were younger and had
an offer like that,

723
00:55:17,469 --> 00:55:19,833
I wouldn't mind getting shot.

724
00:55:19,868 --> 00:55:21,755
I'll drop by tomorrow.

725
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:23,273
Thank you.

726
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,100
How long are you going to let
Meredith kick you around?

727
00:55:36,135 --> 00:55:39,400
Until I get ready to leave town.
- And when's that going to be?

728
00:55:39,435 --> 00:55:41,005
Any day now.

729
00:55:48,948 --> 00:55:52,293
You've got a lot of nerve coming here
haven't you done enough already?

730
00:55:52,328 --> 00:55:55,595
You can wait outside, Kate.
Jed and I have a little business.

731
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:58,945
That was $200 you wanted, wasn't it?

732
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,680
Could you use another 1,000?
You know the answer to that.

733
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,733
What do I have to do for it?

734
00:56:05,768 --> 00:56:08,566
Doc Hiatt says Clay O'Mara's
going to live.

735
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:10,377
I say he's wrong.

736
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:13,179
Doc never was
very good at guessing.

737
00:56:13,214 --> 00:56:15,910
That Silver shipment's
due in four days.

738
00:56:15,945 --> 00:56:19,836
Just before you leave town, drop in
on O'Mara at the Sheriff's house.

739
00:56:19,871 --> 00:56:21,680
Sure!

740
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:34,186
We're going to do like you say.

741
00:56:34,221 --> 00:56:37,186
We'll kiss this town goodbye
right after the Bullion robbery.

742
00:56:37,221 --> 00:56:41,043
Why do we have to wait for that?
- There's $100,000 on that shipment.

743
00:56:41,078 --> 00:56:42,755
Not for you, there isn't.
- Why not?

744
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,918
When Meredith and the wagon show up
for that silver, I won't be around.

745
00:56:45,953 --> 00:56:47,844
I'll be driving hard to Diablo.

746
00:56:47,879 --> 00:56:49,903
That's the first place
they'd look for you.

747
00:56:49,938 --> 00:56:52,998
I'll be there long enough to hide
the silver till things cool down.

748
00:56:53,033 --> 00:56:56,280
What happens to me?
- We get together in Dallas.

749
00:56:56,315 --> 00:56:59,201
Here, this will take care of you
till I get there.

750
00:56:59,236 --> 00:57:02,115
Did Meredith give you this money?
- It's a present.

751
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:04,951
I'll bet, what kind of dirty work
does it buy?

752
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:09,150
It buys nothing, I'm going to double
cross Meredith right down the line.

753
00:58:59,157 --> 00:59:00,530
Kind of late, ain't it?

754
00:59:00,565 --> 00:59:04,217
Start your trip without the Bullion,
we've been double-crossed.

755
00:59:04,252 --> 00:59:06,521
By Jed Ringer?
- By no one else.

756
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:29,200
What went wrong?
- Everything!

757
00:59:29,235 --> 00:59:31,218
Is O'Mara still at your house?

758
00:59:31,253 --> 00:59:33,585
He is, I thought Ringer was
supposed to take care of him?

759
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,081
He was.
- What happened to him?

760
00:59:35,116 --> 00:59:36,545
He got a little greedy.

761
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:39,595
He killed the driver and two guards
and ran out on both of us.

762
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,483
Any idea which way he's headed?
- Diablo.

763
00:59:41,518 --> 00:59:42,496
Let's go.
- No.

764
00:59:42,531 --> 00:59:44,692
You're not going to let him
get away with this?

765
00:59:44,727 --> 00:59:46,657
You bring him in,
you bring the silver in.

766
00:59:46,692 --> 00:59:49,207
What good will that do?
- Keep him from enjoying it.

767
00:59:49,242 --> 00:59:51,723
There's a better way.
You still have a deputy.

768
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:53,046
Let him take Ringer for us.

769
00:59:53,081 --> 00:59:55,056
He doesn't have to
know about the silver.

770
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,327
We got to have some reason for
sending him out.

771
00:59:57,362 --> 00:59:59,564
He's looking for the man
who killed his folks.

772
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,560
Why couldn't that be Ringer?

773
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:19,996
You still got a deputy
named O'Mara around here?

774
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:21,848
Yeah, he's still around.

775
01:00:21,883 --> 01:00:25,364
That calls for a celebration.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

776
01:00:31,026 --> 01:00:32,730
You're looking almost well.

777
01:00:32,765 --> 01:00:35,563
It's because you're such
a good nurse.

778
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:39,982
You ought to make a career
out of taking care of me.

779
01:00:40,017 --> 01:00:41,786
I intend to.

780
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,956
When are we leaving for Denver?

781
01:00:45,991 --> 01:00:48,256
As soon as we can.

782
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:52,387
Doc Hiatt said you'd be able
to travel by tomorrow.

783
01:00:53,429 --> 01:00:55,351
Who else have you been talking to?

784
01:00:56,255 --> 01:01:00,077
Reverend Moorehead.
He's free tomorrow morning.

785
01:01:00,112 --> 01:01:02,344
Has your uncle got
his shotgun ready?

786
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:05,490
You're not going to jilt me!

787
01:01:05,525 --> 01:01:09,996
Look, I didn't come to Santiago
to find a bride.

788
01:01:10,031 --> 01:01:11,403
You happy that you did?

789
01:01:11,438 --> 01:01:16,887
No, just that I haven't finished
what I came here to do.

790
01:01:16,922 --> 01:01:18,673
But you...

791
01:01:21,068 --> 01:01:23,024
I got something to show you.

792
01:01:25,042 --> 01:01:28,006
Ringer left town last night
I checked through his room

793
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:30,970
and found this bill of sale
for your father's cattle.

794
01:01:31,005 --> 01:01:33,030
Looks like he's the man
I'm looking for.

795
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:35,006
It's pretty strong evidence
against him.

796
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:36,947
Think he headed for Diablo?
- Probably.

797
01:01:36,982 --> 01:01:38,889
That's where I'm headed.

798
01:01:38,924 --> 01:01:40,756
Clay, you're not going!

799
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:42,829
Don't try to stop me, Laurie.

800
01:01:42,864 --> 01:01:44,821
I can't mean very much to you

801
01:01:44,856 --> 01:01:48,166
if you think nothing of risking
your life and our future.

802
01:01:48,882 --> 01:01:51,771
My father and brother thought
they had a future, too.

803
01:01:53,716 --> 01:01:55,933
I'm sorry, Clay.

804
01:01:55,968 --> 01:01:59,984
I guess I wasn't thinking right,
I know you have to do this.

805
01:02:29,301 --> 01:02:32,145
Hey, O'Mara!

806
01:02:36,146 --> 01:02:39,015
Well, hello.

807
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:42,395
I brought a bucket of beer for Clay.

808
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:44,905
He's not here. He's gone.

809
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,380
Did he go looking for me?

810
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:49,085
No, Jed Ringer.

811
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,622
What's old Jed done now?

812
01:02:51,657 --> 01:02:54,148
He's the one who killed
Clay's father and brother.

813
01:02:54,183 --> 01:02:57,980
Who said so?
- My uncle.

814
01:02:58,712 --> 01:03:01,795
Where's your uncle?
- He's gone, too.

815
01:03:07,103 --> 01:03:08,786
My compliments.

816
01:03:29,674 --> 01:03:30,982
Come in.

817
01:03:37,887 --> 01:03:41,129
No, I always like to keep
in touch with old friends.

818
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:46,770
They running you out of town, Kate?

819
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:50,263
That's a habit of mine,
losing interest.

820
01:03:52,168 --> 01:03:54,969
Of course, I might always
get it back.

821
01:03:55,004 --> 01:03:57,770
Is that what you
came up to tell me?

822
01:03:57,805 --> 01:03:58,874
No.

823
01:03:58,909 --> 01:04:02,197
As a matter of fact, I was wondering
where I could locate Jed.

824
01:04:02,232 --> 01:04:04,382
What do you want with Jed?

825
01:04:04,417 --> 01:04:06,493
Nothing, but Clay O'Mara does.

826
01:04:06,528 --> 01:04:08,428
They found out about
the robbery already?

827
01:04:08,463 --> 01:04:09,509
What robbery?

828
01:04:09,544 --> 01:04:12,729
All I heard is O'Mara found out it
was Jed who killed his folks.

829
01:04:12,764 --> 01:04:14,743
Who told him that?
- Kenyon.

830
01:04:14,778 --> 01:04:18,202
That dirty, double-crossing...
- Jed was in on the deal someplace.

831
01:04:18,237 --> 01:04:20,107
He only helped them move the cattle.

832
01:04:20,142 --> 01:04:21,977
It was Meredith
who did the shooting!

833
01:04:22,677 --> 01:04:26,113
Meredith? That ain't the way
the Sheriff told it.

834
01:04:27,273 --> 01:04:29,386
I think I'll go see Mr Kenyon.

835
01:04:29,421 --> 01:04:31,912
Now get out, Whitey.
I have to get dressed.

836
01:04:32,714 --> 01:04:35,626
Don't mind me.

837
01:04:35,661 --> 01:04:37,382
Get out.

838
01:04:48,735 --> 01:04:49,915
Hello?

839
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:51,732
Is the sheriff in?

840
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:54,042
Not right now,
could I take a message?

841
01:04:54,077 --> 01:04:56,089
Yeah, you can take a message.

842
01:04:56,124 --> 01:04:58,365
Tell him if anything
happens to Jed Ringer,

843
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,564
I'm going to come back and kill him.

844
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:02,185
Wait!

845
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,877
I don't understand.

846
01:05:03,912 --> 01:05:06,688
Your Uncle told O'Mara
Jed killed his folks.

847
01:05:06,723 --> 01:05:07,563
I know.

848
01:05:07,598 --> 01:05:09,349
Jed didn't do it.
- Why would uncle...

849
01:05:09,384 --> 01:05:12,308
Because he's trying to frame an
innocent man to save his own hide.

850
01:05:12,343 --> 01:05:14,121
You can't mean that!

851
01:05:14,156 --> 01:05:17,193
You mean to tell me you don't know
what's been going on?

852
01:05:18,363 --> 01:05:21,046
No, I guess you wouldn't at that.

853
01:05:21,081 --> 01:05:23,720
You're engaged to Tom Meredith,
aren't you?

854
01:05:23,755 --> 01:05:25,706
Not any more.

855
01:05:25,741 --> 01:05:29,882
You don't know how lucky you are!
He's the one who did the killing.

856
01:05:42,241 --> 01:05:45,517
You get rid of the wagon,
I'll meet you when I finish here.

857
01:06:19,852 --> 01:06:21,934
Whoa!

858
01:06:28,533 --> 01:06:30,706
I didn't know this is
a Wells Fargo station?

859
01:06:30,741 --> 01:06:32,113
Ain't said it was.

860
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,364
How did you come by it?

861
01:06:36,399 --> 01:06:39,675
I found it sitting on the road,
nobody around.

862
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:41,853
You're under arrest.

863
01:06:41,888 --> 01:06:45,233
I had nothing to do with it.
I told you, I found it.

864
01:06:52,038 --> 01:06:53,645
Hey, I've been looking for you.

865
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,497
I heard you was
looking for Jed Ringer.

866
01:06:55,532 --> 01:06:58,547
I didn't know it was advertised.
- Your girl told me.

867
01:06:58,582 --> 01:06:59,901
Where'd you see Laurie?

868
01:06:59,936 --> 01:07:02,346
At the house, I brought you beer
but you'd already left town!

869
01:07:02,381 --> 01:07:04,757
Why don't you let me know what
you're going to do?

870
01:07:04,792 --> 01:07:06,938
That's why I was looking for you.

871
01:07:06,973 --> 01:07:10,238
I forgive you, kid, as long as
I didn't miss the fire works!

872
01:07:10,273 --> 01:07:12,194
Who stole the express wagon?

873
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:14,115
That's what I aim to find out.

874
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:15,810
I ain't talking.

875
01:07:15,845 --> 01:07:19,463
Better change your mind, Frank.
He's a friend.

876
01:07:56,057 --> 01:07:59,754
Are you going in after him or are
you going to wait till he comes out?

877
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:00,922
What would you do?

878
01:08:00,957 --> 01:08:02,993
I'd wait, he's bound
to get hungry sometime

879
01:08:03,028 --> 01:08:04,793
and he can't eat
that silver shipment.

880
01:08:04,828 --> 01:08:06,915
I've waited too long already.

881
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:09,003
It's more exciting this way.

882
01:08:34,196 --> 01:08:36,687
Some folks run to fires,
I run to shooting.

883
01:08:36,722 --> 01:08:38,971
Don't get yourself hurt, Whitey.

884
01:08:41,537 --> 01:08:42,906
Ringer!

885
01:08:42,941 --> 01:08:45,794
It's me, Whitey Kincade!

886
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:47,854
And don't waste no lead on me!

887
01:08:47,889 --> 01:08:51,222
I'm just stringing along to see
you and O'Mara shoot it out!

888
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:28,989
You're cornered, Ringer.
Throw out your gun.

889
01:09:29,024 --> 01:09:31,762
Don't you do it, Ringer!
Shoot it out!

890
01:09:31,797 --> 01:09:33,566
You don't want to hang, do you?

891
01:09:33,601 --> 01:09:35,209
Thanks.

892
01:09:37,164 --> 01:09:39,246
It's your last chance, Ringer.

893
01:09:39,281 --> 01:09:41,209
Come on out.

894
01:09:58,977 --> 01:10:02,879
Nice shooting, kid, I wouldn't have
missed it for nothing.

895
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:16,988
Looks bad, Whitey.
Think you can sit on a horse?

896
01:10:17,023 --> 01:10:20,076
Sure I can, just give me a hand.

897
01:10:20,111 --> 01:10:22,525
Ha, what a laugh!

898
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,921
I can see the marker now,

899
01:10:24,956 --> 01:10:29,336
"Here lies Whitey Kincade,
an innocent bystander".

900
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:43,891
Sort of off your range, ain't you?
- Your brothers around?

901
01:10:43,926 --> 01:10:46,347
Haven't seen them
since yesterday, why?

902
01:10:46,382 --> 01:10:49,476
We're riding after O'Mara, thought
you might like to go along.

903
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:51,972
All right.

904
01:11:04,992 --> 01:11:06,584
What happened to you, Whitey?

905
01:11:06,619 --> 01:11:08,273
Help me get him inside.

906
01:11:17,135 --> 01:11:20,445
Get me some clean rags
and a bottle of that whisky.

907
01:11:23,885 --> 01:11:26,695
Is there a doctor in this town?
- Not even a horse doctor!

908
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:29,821
Rig me up a buckboard. I got to get
Whitey to Santiago.

909
01:11:35,409 --> 01:11:37,127
Looks like O'Mara's in the saloon.

910
01:11:37,162 --> 01:11:40,541
Whitey Kincade must be with him,
there's his horse.

911
01:11:40,576 --> 01:11:41,967
Maybe we're lucky.

912
01:12:12,285 --> 01:12:15,880
Whitey, Sheriff Kenyon's outside.
- Who's with him?

913
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:19,696
Tom Meredith and Tim Lowerie.
- That figures.

914
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,430
I better tell him about Ringer.

915
01:12:22,465 --> 01:12:26,617
You go through those swinging doors,
and you'll be dead before me!

916
01:12:26,652 --> 01:12:27,615
What do you mean?

917
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:30,141
Why do you think Kenyon
sent you out after me?

918
01:12:30,176 --> 01:12:32,402
And the Lowerie brothers?

919
01:12:32,437 --> 01:12:34,640
Because he figured
you'd never come back.

920
01:12:34,675 --> 01:12:36,844
You tried to tell me that
once before.

921
01:12:36,879 --> 01:12:39,049
You thought I was making jokes.

922
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:42,073
Then it wasn't Ringer.

923
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,977
No. Meredith shot them both down.

924
01:12:45,012 --> 01:12:47,579
Why didn't you tell me that
back at the mine?

925
01:12:47,614 --> 01:12:50,617
Because you thought it was Ringer
he had a good chance to kill you.

926
01:12:50,652 --> 01:12:53,571
I figured if you was going to die
you might as well die happy.

927
01:12:53,606 --> 01:12:56,289
Still hard to believe
that Kenyon has...

928
01:12:56,324 --> 01:12:58,973
Why, because you're sweet
on his niece?

929
01:13:11,628 --> 01:13:13,095
Hold it, kid.

930
01:13:16,175 --> 01:13:19,224
If you're so anxious to get shot,
I can do it right here

931
01:13:19,259 --> 01:13:22,273
and save you the trouble of going
through those doors.

932
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,521
You getting real soft, Whitey.

933
01:13:26,556 --> 01:13:28,110
Yeah?

934
01:13:28,145 --> 01:13:30,663
I told you once before,

935
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:34,941
if I ever started feeling like
a human being, I'd shoot myself.

936
01:15:31,207 --> 01:15:32,447
Clay!

937
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,520
It's all right, Laurie.

938
01:15:40,831 --> 01:15:42,992
There's something I got to tell you.

939
01:15:43,027 --> 01:15:45,323
I already know.

940
01:15:46,302 --> 01:15:47,336
Sorry.

941
01:15:47,371 --> 01:15:49,124
Uncle Fred?

942
01:15:49,159 --> 01:15:52,981
He's dead. Meredith's in jail.

943
01:16:01,504 --> 01:16:03,038
Tickets.

944
01:16:03,073 --> 01:16:04,810
Have your tickets ready, please.

945
01:16:04,845 --> 01:16:07,714
Well, hello Clay, I haven't
seen you around lately.

946
01:16:07,749 --> 01:16:11,162
I took a leave of absence, Henry.
- Been thinking of taking one myself!

947
01:16:11,197 --> 01:16:14,361
This pass looks all right for you
but what about the young lady?

948
01:16:14,396 --> 01:16:16,358
That reads 'and family', doesn't it?

949
01:16:16,393 --> 01:16:18,791
Sure does.
- Meet Mrs O'Mara.

950
01:16:18,826 --> 01:16:21,190
Well, I'll be! Congratulations.

951
01:16:22,845 --> 01:16:26,440
Excuse me, I've got to close the
windows, we're coming to a tunnel.

952
01:16:29,286 --> 01:16:31,118
Is it a long tunnel?

953
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:32,908
It's long enough.

954
01:16:32,943 --> 01:16:35,969
Let's not waste it then.
