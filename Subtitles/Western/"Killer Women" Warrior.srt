- Nah.

the cash from one drawer.

00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,479
- Hi.
- (Sighs)

180
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,548
You and the Senator
have to go to counseling?

181
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,082
(Sighs) Four times in the next month,

182
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,284
before the judge will even
consider my divorce petition.

183
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:54,187
How exactly do you walk
into court for a divorce

184
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:56,156
and walk out in marriage counseling?

185
00:06:56,224 --> 00:06:57,924
Welcome to Texas.

186
00:06:57,992 --> 00:06:59,425
The judge has a right to delay,

187
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:02,896
and the judge is Jake's buddy.

188
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,865
- You okay?
- (Mouth full) Not especially.

189
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:06,131
Want to talk about it?

190
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,670
Not especially. Ketchup.

191
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:12,405
Did you find my bank robber?

192
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,606
(Mouth full, chuckles) You wish.

193
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,876
(Clears throat)

194
00:07:16,943 --> 00:07:18,310
(Lowered voice) D.E.A.
has an informer in a gang

195
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,145
who steals and deals prescription meds.

196
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:23,249
A street dealer named "Q-Ball"

197
00:07:23,316 --> 00:07:25,817
was re-upping his inventory of oxycodone.

198
00:07:25,886 --> 00:07:28,254
He paid our guy with bills
from your bank robbery.

199
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:30,555
So your q-ball and my perp are intimate.

200
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:32,624
A drug dealer and his addict...

201
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:33,993
can't get more intimate than that.

202
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,427
Where's q-ball being held?

203
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:37,363
Nowhere. We're not gonna arrest him

204
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,063
until we roll up the whole crew.

205
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:42,166
But you know where he is, right?

206
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:43,435
Then come on. Let's go.

207
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:45,871
You know... (Clears throat)

208
00:07:45,938 --> 00:07:48,106
I really just wanna finish
my bacon burger, okay?

209
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:53,211
God, I walked right into that.

210
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,114
(Crickets chirping)

211
00:07:59,518 --> 00:08:02,620
(Clatter in distance)

212
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:05,790
Yo, Q-Ball, open the
door! (Q-Ball) Stay back!

213
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:07,858
I got a shotgun pointed right at your head.

214
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:09,660
(Lowered voice) It's all right.

215
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:11,429
Gonna light you up right through the door,

216
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,764
- send you to hell.
- (Lowered voice) That doesn't sound all right.

217
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:15,198
Trust me, the only thing

218
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:17,100
that q-ball can effectively
light up in his bong.

219
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:19,570
We're comin' in!

220
00:08:19,638 --> 00:08:21,605
Hold your breath. The guy smokes
more inventory than he sells.

221
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:23,741
Ugh! (Grunts)

222
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:26,410
You again.

223
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,413
- What did I do now?
- Bought major weight of oxy.

224
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,250
That'll get you a long stretch.

225
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:32,851
You can't prove that.

226
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,321
Oh, as a matter of fact, I can.

227
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:38,790
We need some information
on one of your customers.

228
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:42,127
Oh, I'm gonna have to assert my privileges.

229
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:44,129
And what did they look like?

230
00:08:44,197 --> 00:08:46,330
Well, I've been researching
it on the Internet.

231
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,800
I run an "alternative pharmacy."

232
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:51,436
And that makes me a health care provider.

233
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:54,472
- Patient information is confidential.
- You're serious?

234
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,840
- Hell, yes.
- Cool.

235
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:58,710
Well, let's see if the U.S.
attorney agrees with you.

236
00:08:58,778 --> 00:08:59,911
Can I borrow your handcuffs for a second?

237
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:03,580
Wait! Wait. What did you want again?

238
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:05,216
Last time you restocked your pharmacy,

239
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:07,084
you paid with some new
hundred-dollar bills.

240
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:09,320
- I did?
- Yeah.

241
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:10,554
Most of the bills that
pass through your hands

242
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:12,756
are crumbled-up twenties covered in snot.

243
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:15,692
- Oh!
- Oh, there it is. Yeah.

244
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,860
(Whispers) Yeah.

245
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:19,897
<i>Those hundreds. Nice.</i>

246
00:09:19,964 --> 00:09:21,498
Where did you get 'em?

247
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:25,302
- Oh, from the Terminator.
- The Terminator?

248
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:26,503
He is a customer.

249
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:29,606
He's got, like, one of those robot arms.

250
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:31,207
The Terminator is a "he"?

251
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:33,310
I'm pretty sure I know the difference.

252
00:09:33,377 --> 00:09:35,445
He's got a girlfriend?

253
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:37,113
Do I look like a matchmaker?

254
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:38,714
How do we find him?

255
00:09:38,782 --> 00:09:42,419
- Dude usually scores every Tuesday and Friday.
- Where?

256
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:44,321
My pharmacy.

257
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,082
(Dan) It's Tuesday.

258
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,551
(Molly) Yep. Supposed to be Terminator day.

259
00:10:01,618 --> 00:10:03,152
(Sighs)

260
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:06,922
Look at Basil shake it.

261
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:08,290
- Basil?
- Ah! Ah!

262
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,692
Don't... denigrate Basil.

263
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,661
She's my good luck charm at stakeouts.

264
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:15,297
<i>(Moos) Can you do that?</i>

265
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,900
(Vehicle approaching)

266
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,971
(Sighs)

267
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,474
15 years doing stakeouts,
and they still suck.

268
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,909
I don't know. I kinda like 'em.

269
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:29,410
Huh?

270
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:33,014
You enjoy sitting around,
wishing something would happen?

271
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:35,516
I'm not an adrenaline junkie like you.

272
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:37,185
I'm not an adrenaline junkie.

273
00:10:37,252 --> 00:10:40,754
I just... if I don't have
something to react to,

274
00:10:40,822 --> 00:10:41,989
I get bored.

275
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:45,193
I'm bored.

276
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,694
(Chuckles) (Sighs)

277
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:48,296
Life can't be big all the time.

278
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:50,198
<i>- Basil disagrees.
- (Moos)</i>

279
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:51,499
(Chuckles) (Grunts)

280
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:01,308
- Someplace I'd like to be?
- Hmm?

281
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,210
You just went somewhere else on me there.

282
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:06,914
(Sighs)

283
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:09,616
I was thinking about my mom.

284
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:10,950
Stakeouts remind me of her.

285
00:11:11,018 --> 00:11:12,986
Is she a wanted felon? (Chuckles)

286
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:14,988
She died when I was 11.

287
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:16,523
Oh.

288
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:21,394
I'm sorry.

289
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:22,429
Don't be.

290
00:11:22,497 --> 00:11:23,863
You had no idea.

291
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:25,465
How?

292
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:26,666
Cancer.

293
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:29,002
(Sighs) Oh.

294
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:32,038
(Sniffs)

295
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:34,373
(Sighs) The whole month before she died,

296
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:38,011
she would lie on an old
couch on the screened porch,

297
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:39,178
where the sunlight kept her warm.

298
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:44,416
Dad said Billy and I weren't
supposed to bother her,

299
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:46,785
but... (Chuckles)

300
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:48,621
I'd go in there all the time. (Chuckles)

301
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:50,789
- Oh, that's surprising.
- (Chuckles)

302
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:58,564
(Clicks tongue) Uh...

303
00:11:58,632 --> 00:12:01,867
sometimes she'd wake up...

304
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:05,737
and we'd talk about the small things...

305
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:08,173
something an animal did that was funny.

306
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,808
(Sniffles)

307
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:14,579
But mostly I just sat
there and watched her.

308
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:21,286
I guess waiting reminds
me of my mom. (Chuckles)

309
00:12:25,924 --> 00:12:28,125
(Flicks toy)

310
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:29,894
(Chuckles) (Chuckles)

311
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,930
You owe my cow an apology.

312
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:39,770
(Car doors shut)

313
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:44,008
Who's she?

314
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:46,410
I don't know. You're girlfriend, maybe?

315
00:12:46,477 --> 00:12:49,479
- I'm married.
- Does your wife like to rob banks?

316
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:50,773
(Clears throat) Who's she?

317
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:53,680
Special Agent Clark, FBI.

318
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:55,015
Sorry to interrupt your fun here,

319
00:12:55,082 --> 00:12:56,716
but I was uninformed
you were being detained

320
00:12:56,784 --> 00:12:58,252
up until an hour ago.

321
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,753
Welcome to the party.

322
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,155
Shouldn't have started without me.

323
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:02,489
(Chair scrapes floor)

324
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:06,026
What's this woman's connection to you?

325
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:07,827
I just told her. I don't know her.

326
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:09,529
Well, the thing is, Mr. Lauterbach,

327
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:10,897
those nice new hundred-dollar bills

328
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,033
we found in your pocket
were stolen from a bank...

329
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,934
by her.

330
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,002
She steal the money, give it to you

331
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,236
so you can get high?

332
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:19,706
So I can "get high"?

333
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,509
I got this arm blown off in Afghanistan,

334
00:13:21,577 --> 00:13:22,910
and it still hurts like hot needles

335
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:25,246
sticking in it, even
though the arm ain't there.

336
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:26,780
That's pretty funny, huh?

337
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,716
That's why I "get high."

338
00:13:28,783 --> 00:13:31,619
You could go to a V.A. hospital.

339
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,854
No, I did. They gave
me a bottle of aspirin.

340
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:35,590
Who's the girl?

341
00:13:35,657 --> 00:13:36,857
I just told you.

342
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:38,626
I never saw her before in my life.

343
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,327
Then where'd you get the money?

344
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:43,463
I found it...

345
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,065
under my pillow.

346
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,069
I know it sounds far-fetched, but...

347
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:50,638
It didn't seem like he was lying.

348
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,872
Really?

349
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,808
I'm trained to read
tells, and I'm good at it.

350
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,145
I'm sure.

351
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,979
Why don't you take a shot?

352
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,949
<i>♪</i>

353
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:05,452
Okay.

354
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,588
I'll start slow, Mr. Winston.

355
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:10,923
- It is Mr. Winston?
- It is.

And I'm not gonna lie about it.

I think anybody would be.

436
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:29,824
$12,000...

437
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:30,991
in cash,

438
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:33,026
right by my bed.

439
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:34,829
Was there a note or anything

440

- Nothin'.

an angel had left it.

00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:45,672
You know, just find some reason to keep it.

444
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,575
You know...

445
00:18:48,642 --> 00:18:51,078
I lost my house last year,

446
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:54,214
and, uh, I had to move back in with my mom.

447
00:18:54,282 --> 00:18:57,517
I really wanted to make
a go of it on my own.

448
00:18:57,585 --> 00:19:00,052
I mean, I'm on disability.

449
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,888
I get treatment at the V.A.,

450
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:03,222
but there's no provision for extra money

451
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,491
to keep things like...

452
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,059
(Chuckles) your own house.

453
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:10,430
So what made you notify the
police about the money then?

454
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:12,231
(Chuckles) Stupidity.

455
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:13,666
- (Chuckles)
- (Chuckles) No, I...

456
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:16,335

anything about the person

469

in here the other night?

470

And how do you know that?

472
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:53,504
I asked her.

473
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:55,273
You spoke to the lady?

474
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:56,641
Well, what else did she say?

475
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,708
She said that she liked Rudy.

- Yes, ma'am.

00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:42,008
You know what that means?

535
00:23:42,076 --> 00:23:43,676
It means your daughter is a hero.

536
00:23:43,744 --> 00:23:47,314
Yes, ma'am. She is.

537
00:23:47,381 --> 00:23:51,150
(Object clatters) But when she got home,

538
00:23:51,217 --> 00:23:53,218
she was on edge all the time.

539
00:23:53,286 --> 00:23:54,554
Impatient.

540
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:56,388
She used to be just the opposite.

541
00:23:56,457 --> 00:23:59,191
I mean, hell, she'd
fight with people in line

542
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:00,927
at the post office over
nothing. (Silverware clinking)

543
00:24:00,994 --> 00:24:02,929
I thought she just needed more discipline,

544
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:04,764
like she was used to.

545
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:06,898
So I instituted some house rules...

546
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:10,669
early morning P.T., bed
checks, cleaning duties.

547
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:11,736
(Lid clanks)

548
00:24:11,804 --> 00:24:14,073
It only made things worse.

549
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,842
She started to argue with me,
and that never used to happen.

550
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:18,944
What did you fight about?

551
00:24:19,012 --> 00:24:22,413
(Clatters) How the V.A. wasn't
doing this and that for the soldiers.

552
00:24:22,482 --> 00:24:26,852
She said she needed to do
something about it to fix it.

553
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,590
And then, suddenly...

554
00:24:31,657 --> 00:24:33,725
- she changed.
- How?

555
00:24:33,793 --> 00:24:35,326
Well, she wasn't angry anymore.

556
00:24:35,394 --> 00:24:36,895
She was calm.

557
00:24:38,464 --> 00:24:40,498
"Corporal Corbett traversed
into hostile territory

558
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:43,468
under heavy fire to drag
a wounded soldier to safety.

559
00:24:43,535 --> 00:24:45,370
After administering life-saving care,

560
00:24:45,437 --> 00:24:47,838
she picked up the soldier's
rifle and single-handedly

561
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:49,273
assaulted the nearest enemy position,

562
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:52,176
killing four insurgents
and wounding many others."

563
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:54,512
This woman is a hero.

564
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:57,214
"Corporal Corbett then
repelled repeated enemy assaults

565
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:58,716
until reinforcements arrived."

566
00:24:58,783 --> 00:25:01,519
We already know she's a skilled marksman.

567
00:25:01,586 --> 00:25:04,087
"Her calm and focus under
fire were remarkable."

568
00:25:04,155 --> 00:25:06,089
Ranger, I don't know if you notice,

569
00:25:06,157 --> 00:25:08,125
but this is Texas, not Afghanistan.

570
00:25:08,192 --> 00:25:10,427
Her violence is... is escalating.

571
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:13,263
And we don't give out
medals for robbing banks.

572
00:25:13,331 --> 00:25:15,632
You're not hearing me.

573
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:17,467
She's calm when she robs,

574
00:25:17,535 --> 00:25:19,403
and then gives away the money.

575
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,871
This is a woman who feels
the need to be heroic,

576
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:24,841
but doesn't know how to
be a hero in civilian life.

577
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:26,176
And that's sad.

578
00:25:26,244 --> 00:25:29,412
Fortunately, yours is the
only heart that's breaking.

579
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:31,848
(Sighs) Lieutenant, are we
here to praise Andrea Corbett,

580
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,917
or do we want to stop her
before she kills somebody?

581
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:35,785
We've distributed the suspect's photo

582
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:38,054
to all area banks. They've
stepped up precautions,

583
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:41,024
added extra security,
activated silent alarms.

584
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:43,560
Then you've covered the basics, Lieutenant.

585
00:25:45,862 --> 00:25:47,996
I expect to be kept in the loop.

586
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:49,698
I'm not walking into another interrogation

587
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:52,435
15 minutes after it started.

588
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,075
(Object clatters) You know...

589
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,443
I had a chance to apply
to the FBI one time.

590
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,678
And?

591
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:05,313
I didn't care for the dress code.

592
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:07,449
(Mouse clicks)

593
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:10,852
(Indistinct conversations)

594
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,988
(Sighs) What a nice surprise.

595
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:17,425
Yeah. I wish this was.

596
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,394
(Envelope rustles)

597
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:20,728
You got a subpoena?

598
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:24,532
Yep. From your not-quite-yet ex-husband.

599
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,968
He wants me to testify
in your divorce case.

600
00:26:27,035 --> 00:26:28,269
- About what?
- I don't know.

601
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,071
Probably those things
you do with your tongue.

602
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:33,108
He's raising an adultery claim.

603
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,475
How does that help him?

604
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,944
Turn the judge against you,
maybe push things his way.

605
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,946
Because I won't go to those
damn counseling sessions.

606
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,351
It seems like your life
would be a lot easier

607
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:46,286
if you just did what the judge said.

608
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,790
- No.
- (Scoffs) Well, I'm not telling you to reconcile.

609
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,858
Just... grind through the sessions.

610
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:53,260
Then you'll get your divorce.

611
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:55,462
And I don't have to testify in open court.

612
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,997
Oh, did your fun, carefree lifestyle

613
00:26:57,064 --> 00:26:58,132
just get complicated?

614
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,667
Yes, it did.

615
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:02,302
And I'm okay with that.

616
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,537
Well, then what's the problem?

617
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:06,106
I'm an undercover D.E.A. Agent, Molly.

618
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:08,141
<i>This is a public case. It's a big problem.</i>

619
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:11,477
Listen to me.

620
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:15,047
A tactical surrender
isn't always a bad thing.

621
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:16,715
- Is that so?
- Yes.

622
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:17,883
You're not thinking of yourself here,

623
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:19,918
- not at all?
- Thinking about myself? No.

624
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:22,988
I'm thinking of the best way
to handle a bad situation.

625
00:27:23,056 --> 00:27:24,657
- You just repeated the question.
- What?

626
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:26,125
It's your tell.

627
00:27:26,192 --> 00:27:27,860
- When you lie, you repeat the question first.
- Oh.

628
00:27:27,927 --> 00:27:30,662
- Come on.
- I'm sorry my divorce is such an inconvenience for you.

629
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:32,764
Whoa. Whoa, Molly.

630
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:35,267
Hey. Look. (Sighs)

631
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:36,635
Look, let's just take a step back.

632
00:27:36,702 --> 00:27:38,370
I've got a better idea.

633
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:40,138
Let's take a real big step back.

634
00:27:40,206 --> 00:27:41,173
That way you can go back to your old life

635
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,541
just like you want to.

636
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:44,576
Are you serious right now?

637
00:27:44,644 --> 00:27:45,943
Because if you are, I'm offended.

638
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:48,379

639
00:27:48,446 --> 00:27:50,414

a long-distance runner.

677

you will die.

the girl who was here?

711
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:29,711
No, ma'am. Ranger Parker.

712
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:31,413
Any chance he'll wake up soon?

713
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,847
That's hard to say.

714
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:34,849
I'll tell you what I just told his niece,

715
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:37,285
- leave your number, and I'll call you.
- His niece was just here?

716
00:31:37,352 --> 00:31:38,920
Yeah. I don't know what happened to her.

717
00:31:43,592 --> 00:31:45,159
- Is that from her?
- Could be.

718
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:47,896
I didn't notice it there before.

719
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:51,598
(Rustles)

720
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,500
- That niece... when did she leave?
- Like, two seconds ago.

721
00:31:53,568 --> 00:31:55,069
She was standing right here. I...

722
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:58,406
(blinds rattle)

723
00:32:01,143 --> 00:32:03,744
(Banging on window) Hey, Clark!

724
00:32:03,812 --> 00:32:06,180
(Sighs) Call security.

725
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:17,724
(Engine revving)

726
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:21,094
(Siren wailing, tires screeching)

727
00:32:21,162 --> 00:32:22,729
(Static crackles) Sierra one.

728
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:27,000
(Siren wailing)

729
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:32,038
(Tires screech)

730
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:36,843
(Engine revving)

731
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,645
(Tires peal, siren wailing)

732
00:32:54,595 --> 00:32:56,061
(Tires screech)

733
00:32:58,898 --> 00:33:01,700
(Sirens continue wailing)

734
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:03,168
(Brakes squeal)

735
00:33:06,473 --> 00:33:07,806
Shooter's on the roof. Take cover.

736
00:33:12,312 --> 00:33:13,879
(Grunts)

737
00:33:13,946 --> 00:33:15,780
I will blow his brains
out! Stay the hell back!

738
00:33:15,848 --> 00:33:17,281
(Molly) Andrea, it's over! Let him go!

739
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:18,483
Move! Okay, okay.

740
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,718
- Move! Go. Get up!
- (Grunts)

741
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:21,919
Let him go!

742
00:33:21,987 --> 00:33:23,320
(Glass shattering)

743
00:33:25,757 --> 00:33:27,758
(Gunshot)

744
00:33:27,826 --> 00:33:29,560
How do you like your war hero now?

745
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:44,582
(Breathing heavily)

746
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:46,451
- Move, move. Down! Go!
- (Clark) You're surrounded.

747
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:49,788
Stay low! Drop your weapon and
come out with your hands up!

748
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,594
I'll communicate with your sniper directly.

749
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:58,129
- You're planning on taking her out?
- Oh, yeah.

750
00:33:58,197 --> 00:33:59,631
She's not firing blanks.

751
00:33:59,698 --> 00:34:01,232
Don't you think it's odd
that she's a skilled marksman

752
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,600
and hasn't hit anyone?

753
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:04,068
Well, maybe she's having an off day.

754
00:34:04,136 --> 00:34:07,004
Now step out of my way
and let me do my job.

755
00:34:07,072 --> 00:34:09,340
Sierra one, are you set up yet?

756
00:34:09,408 --> 00:34:11,909
Sierra one in position.

757
00:34:11,977 --> 00:34:13,443
Let me know when you have a shot.

758
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:14,912
(Static crackles)

759
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,080
I'm clear.

760
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:18,215
Don't do this. Let me talk to her.

761
00:34:18,283 --> 00:34:21,251
- Take the shot.
- Copy that.

762
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:27,158
Delay that order. This
is Texas Ranger Parker.

763
00:34:27,225 --> 00:34:29,125
The suspect is a decorated army veteran.

764
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:31,261
Stand down, Parker. Now!

765
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:32,296
She's deliberately aiming off target.

766
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:34,130
She won't shoot to kill.

767
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,932
We have a hostage at gunpoint.

768
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,668
We need to help her, not kill her.

769
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:42,472
(Static crackles) Sierra
one, I repeat, take the shot

770
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,674
if you've got the suspect locked.

771
00:34:43,741 --> 00:34:44,908
(Static crackles)

772
00:34:50,815 --> 00:34:52,916
Target's obscured.

773
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,151
Say again, Sierra one.

774
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:59,388
I repeat, the target's obscured.

775
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,257
I don't have a shot.

776
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,834
Parker, you're out of your league.

777
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,002
Just back down. What
the hell are you doing?

778
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,539
Bringing her in. Andrea?

779
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:17,973
Up. Up, up, up.

780
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:21,043
I'm Ranger Molly Parker.
I'm coming over to talk.

781
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:22,845
One more step, and this man dies.

782
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,347
I don't believe that.

783
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:29,351
(Belt clatters) You're a medic.

784
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,286
You take care of people just like he does.

785
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,724
Let him go.

786
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:36,991
You know how this ends if you don't.

787
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:39,927
(Breathing heavily)

788
00:35:39,995 --> 00:35:42,196
Fine. I'll kill you instead.

789
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,565
You need to turn yourself in.

790
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:45,199
No one needs to die here.

791
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,834
Then let me go, and no one will.

792
00:35:46,902 --> 00:35:48,336
You know that's not gonna happen.

793
00:35:48,404 --> 00:35:50,605
And it would be a damn shame
for you to survive Afghanistan

794
00:35:50,673 --> 00:35:52,874
and get killed in a parking lot in Texas.

795
00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:55,376
Really? You think anybody cares?

796
00:35:55,443 --> 00:35:57,044
I know they do.

797
00:35:57,112 --> 00:35:59,346
Who cares about those vets
that I gave the money to?

798
00:35:59,414 --> 00:36:02,416
They lost their houses,
they lost their limbs.

799
00:36:02,484 --> 00:36:03,651
And all they got from the government

800
00:36:03,718 --> 00:36:05,419
- was the runaround.
- People care about them.

801
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:07,021
- I care about them.
- Yeah?

802
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:09,356
What have you ever done?
These people get home,

803
00:36:09,424 --> 00:36:11,725
and all they've got
waiting for them is bills.

804
00:36:11,793 --> 00:36:14,127
No parades. No "thank you"s.

805
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:16,263
They get off the plane,
and they have to search

806
00:36:16,331 --> 00:36:18,231
for enough money to get a bus home.

807
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,566
So you're doing this for them?

808
00:36:19,634 --> 00:36:21,902
Every... single... one.

809
00:36:21,969 --> 00:36:24,237
Only thing is, Andrea, that isn't true.

810
00:36:24,305 --> 00:36:26,206
So you're telling me why
I'm doing what I'm doing?

811
00:36:26,274 --> 00:36:27,340
That's a bit much.

812
00:36:27,408 --> 00:36:28,909
I talked to your daddy.

813
00:36:28,976 --> 00:36:33,213
You got home from the
war, you were all antsy.

814
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:36,283
You only got calm again when
you started robbing banks.

815
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,318
'Cause I was doing the right thing. No.

816
00:36:38,385 --> 00:36:40,020
Because it got your adrenaline rushing

817
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:41,921
just like combat did.

818
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:44,424
Your silver star citation said
how calm you were in battle.

819
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:46,726
You've got 50 guns
pointed at you right now,

820
00:36:46,794 --> 00:36:48,328
and you're as cool as the
other side of the pillow.

821
00:36:48,395 --> 00:36:50,430
It's the only way you can feel good again.

822
00:36:50,497 --> 00:36:52,799
You're throwing some money to some vets.

823
00:36:52,866 --> 00:36:54,834
But you're doing this to
make yourself feel better.

824
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:56,101
I've got a gun pointed at your head,

825
00:36:56,169 --> 00:36:57,636
and you don't seem real shaken.

826
00:36:57,704 --> 00:36:59,038
Maybe you got the same problem I do.

827
00:36:59,105 --> 00:37:02,741
I know you won't kill me. What I don't know

828
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:04,310
<i>is if one of these cops is gonna kill you.</i>

829
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:10,883
But that's your plan, isn't it?

830
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:14,085
You know you can't rob
banks 24 hours a day,

831
00:37:14,153 --> 00:37:15,587
so that's not a long-term solution.

832
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,125
You're looking for some
other way to end your pain.

833
00:37:21,193 --> 00:37:22,494
You calling me a coward?

834
00:37:22,562 --> 00:37:24,095
No, not a coward.

835
00:37:24,163 --> 00:37:26,698
You've been wounded. You need help.

836
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:28,734
- There are people that can help you.
- (Cries)

837
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:30,935
I'll make sure they do.

838
00:37:32,872 --> 00:37:34,939
Andrea, you're not alone.

839
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:36,674
- Your daddy loved you with everything in him.
- (Sobs)

840
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:41,346
Just put the gun down...

841
00:37:43,382 --> 00:37:46,417
and let someone help you for once.

00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:49,587
