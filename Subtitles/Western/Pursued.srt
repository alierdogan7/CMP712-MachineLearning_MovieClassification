1
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,994
Jeb?

2
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,064
Jeb, where are you?

3
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:20,372
Oh!

4
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:26,378
Are you all right?
I'm all right.

5
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:31,316
I brought you some things
- some meal and beans and a good canteen.

6
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,052
Is that what kept you-
getting those things?

7
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,087
I came as soon as I could.

8
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:39,291
I brought you a map too.
Look.

9
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:43,261
If you work up north through the
gloriettas, you can hit the skin road.

10
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,898
<i>If I work north? What about you? Yes, jeb.</i>

11
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:51,236
Where will you be?
I'm not going with you.

12
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,705
I knew it as soon
as you came in...

13
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:57,509
By the look on your face
and the way you walked.

14
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,644
You've always been like that-

15
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,915
Able to think with my thoughts
and feel with my feelings.

16
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:06,685
But there's something
that keeps us apart.

17
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:09,921
Oh, jeb, what happened to us?
Why did everything go wrong?

18
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:14,859
I don't know all of it,
but I know some.

19
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:18,330
I've been thinking
and figuring.

20
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:20,898
This is where it started, this
is where it's going to end.

21
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:24,352
You see that rise?
He'll be coming over that.

22
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:26,521
He'll come killing.

23
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:34,395
Come out,
or we'll come in after ya!

24
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:37,665
You hear it?

25
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:43,237
Jeb, honey,
there's no one out there.

26
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:46,508
You're imagining.
I'm not imagining.

27
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:49,176
Remembering.

28
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:52,914
Putting together what happened-
what I guess must've happened.

29
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,683
Thor, it's all coming
back, strong and clear.

30
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:58,520
There's an answer in it.

31
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:01,455
There's something about me
that explains everything.

32
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:04,792
Jeb, I don't understand. I'm
gonna make you understand.

33
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:09,330
I've got to
before they get here.

34
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:12,099
Do you know why
I came to this place?

35
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:15,703
No, jeb, but...
It's not a good hideout.

36
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:18,272
They're sure
to trail you here.

37
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,009
I came for another reason.

38
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:24,946
I was here before,
long ago.

39
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,782
I was a baby then.

40
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,552
I was scared the way
only a kid can get.

41
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:35,222
I was in a dark,
cold place.

42
00:04:38,326 --> 00:04:41,095
I had my eyes closed to get
away from some bad dream-

43
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:44,131
The same dream
I'd been having all my life.

44
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,419
I've never understood it. There
were boots running, flashes.

45
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,421
Daddy? Daddy?

46
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:53,357
but my father wasn't there.

47
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:56,193
Instead, a strange woman
was lying on the floor.

48
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,329
She crawled toward me.

49
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:00,698
That was the first time
I saw your mother.

50
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:24,348
Get up, son. No, jeb,
you can't go to sleep now.

51
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,384
Get your clothes on, son. We're
going away from here. Who is that?

52
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:31,822
That's jeb rand. Now, pay
attention, adam... And thor.

53
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,792
This is jeb.
He's going to live with us.

54
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,061
Come on, now.
Help your sister.

55
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:45,162
They've gone,
every danged one of 'em.

56
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,197
They've moved away
somewhere.

57
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:49,233
Grant, if you ride with
that arm, you'll lose it.

58
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,570
I'll find 'em if it takes me
to the end of my life.

59
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,174
The idea that I was hiding or
running away never quite died out.

60
00:07:57,242 --> 00:08:01,545
It should have, I guess, because
the next seven years I wasn't hiding.

61
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:03,814
Your ma was
taking care of all of us.

62
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:05,916
I was growing up
with you and adam,

63
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:10,420
Going to school, helping to build a
house in the new place we moved to,

64
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:13,423
Having the whole outdoors
for a playground.

65
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:17,945
I'd about stopped having nightmares until
one day when I was about nine or ten-

66
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:54,866
Look, jeb!
A little black chick.

67
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,535
I found him under the house.

68
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:04,442
- What's the matter with you?
- You know what's the matter! You shot the colt!

69
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:06,844
Shot what colt?
Are you crazy?

70
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:11,683
Mom!

71
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,086
<i>Jeb, stop!</i>

72
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:17,088
Stop!

73
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,126
Mom! Mom, they're fighting again! Mom!

74
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:33,071
Now, stop that fighting, boys!
Stop that fighting!

75
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:35,673
Now, stop it!
Stop that fighting, boys!

76
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,675
Thor, pump some water.

77
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,023
Now, stop it! Come on, boys!
Now, stop that fighting!

78
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,158
Come on!
Stop it!

79
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,160
Adam! Jeb!

80
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,564
Now, what's it all about?

81
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,834
He shot the colt.
I didn't!

82
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,836
You did so! You mean
somebody shot our colt?

83
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:08,072
Said it was his.
He said I couldn't ride it.

84
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,842
But I rode it anyway.
He took a shot at it.

85
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:14,278
Or maybe me.
I don't know.

86
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:17,515
But anyway,
he killed the colt.

87
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:20,918
No. Somebody may have killed
him, but it wasn't adam.

88
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:23,988
He's been here all morning
greasing the buckboard.

89
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,091
You say somebody took a shot at
you? Who could it have been, ma?

90
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:33,364
Well, I don't rightly know.

91
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:35,366
Matter of fact, there were some
deer hunters hanging around.

92
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:38,936
Yes, sir. They asked me if
they could hunt down our fence,

93
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:40,938
And I told 'em yes.

94
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:45,743
You go and get your supper off
the stove, and no more fightin'.

95
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,879
You gonna see those men, ma? That's right.

96
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:49,881
Put that wheel
back on.

97
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,868
So, you found us.

98
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:30,671
You covered up
your trail pretty well.

99
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:33,441
As soon as the boy told me
somebody tried to kill him,

100
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,443
I knew it was you.

101
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:41,882
Being a lawyer hasn't done
your shootin' any good, grant.

102
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,353
Yeah. Maybe losin' this some
years ago didn't help any either.

103
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,355
You owe me for a colt.

104
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:53,594
Doggone critter
was too lively.

105
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:57,265
When he crawled off,
he spoiled my aim.

106
00:11:57,332 --> 00:12:00,301
You can't start it all over
again, grant. I won't let you.

107
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:02,736
You're gettin' kind of uppity, ain't you?

108
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:07,107
He's a rand. I knew it the
first minute I laid eyes on him.

109
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:10,411
He brought to mind that you
was married to my brother.

110
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,446
And a score still isn't
settled for his death.

111
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:15,783
You lost a brother,
I lost a husband.

112
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,785
I don't want
any more vengeance for him.

113
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:21,289
I never figured
that you would.

114
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:25,025
That's why I swore that
I'd kill every rand on earth.

115
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:27,261
And he's
the only one left.

116
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,263
How in tarnations
you get him?

117
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,666
Let's say the lord
gave him to me.

118
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:35,903
Let the boy alone, grant.
He's innocent.

119
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,938
That night
ended it for him.

120
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,940
A night like that
don't have an end.

121
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:42,643
What happened to him there
will make him do things just-

122
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:44,778
Just like spirits were
whispering in his ear saying,

123
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:46,914
"kill, kill.
You've got to kill."

124
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:51,319
Spirits may talk to you, but they won't
to him. I don't believe in your spirits.

125
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:54,255
Maybe not, but someday you'll wish
I hadn't missed my shot today...

126
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:58,092
Down on the draw. That's
one day that'll never come.

127
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,229
He's a good boy.
I love him like my own son.

128
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:05,165
What makes you think
that boy loves you?

129
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:13,040
Well... I'll go back
to santa fe.

130
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:16,877
I swear I think I'll leave that
rand alone, let him grow up,

131
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:20,814
Just to see what happens to you when
he's big enough to start asking questions.

132
00:13:24,853 --> 00:13:26,787
Don't forget your money
for the colt.

133
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,393
Thanks for reminding me.

134
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:34,395
This'll help me
bring him up.

135
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:50,978
Did you find 'em, ma?
Did you talk to 'em?

136
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:54,181
Why, sure I did. It was
them deer hunters all right.

137
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:57,084
They shot the colt.

138
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:59,953
Put the team up, adam, and
feed 'em. You help him, thor.

139
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,390
Come in the house with me,
son. I want to talk to you.

140
00:14:17,972 --> 00:14:20,841
Jeb, how much
do you remember...

141
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:23,076
About coming
to live with us-

142
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:25,078
About the night
I brought you here?

143
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:30,584
You must remember something. Not much.

144
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:32,920
You can tell me, jeb.

145
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:37,057
I get mixed up
when I think about that.

146
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:40,661
I remember flashes...

147
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:42,896
And boots runnin'.

148
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:46,900
You know your parents are
dead. That's why I took you in.

149
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:50,170
Yes, ma'am.

150
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:53,441
But you don't remember them?
No, ma'am.

151
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:57,345
Sometimes I try to think
about it. I don't know.

152
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:01,549
My head hurts.

153
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:04,217
It gets all blurred.

154
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:07,821
Sometimes
the lord protects us...

155
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:10,624
By letting us know
only what's needful.

156
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:13,561
What you don't remember
doesn't matter.

157
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:15,563
You belong here
with us now.

158
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:18,566
Don't ask questions
of the past.

159
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:21,501
It has no answers
for you.

160
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,138
Grow up strong in the love
that's here for you.

161
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:27,775
As long as you love in
return, nothing can happen.

162
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:30,143
And you do love us,
don't you, jeb?

163
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:36,717
I'm sorry
I started the fight.

164
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,852
Well, son,

165
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,755
After today you boys won't
have anything to fight about.

166
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:48,762
Adam, thor, come here.

167
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:52,700
Now, pay heed to me,
you children.

168
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:55,836
I'll have no more arguments as
to who owns what on this ranch,

169
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:57,838
Colts or anything else.

170
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:00,240
Everything we have
or ever will have...

171
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:02,542
Belongs to you three
from this day on.

172
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:05,345
You mean, everything has
to be that way? Yes, adam.

173
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:07,380
Have you any objection
to that?

174
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:11,318
Not for thor and me,
but I have for outsiders.

175
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:16,607
There are no outsiders here.

176
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,142
You three are together.
You yourselves...

177
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,347
Are the best and finest
thing there is- a family.

178
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,419
You promise
not to forget that?

179
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,691
I mean all three of you.

180
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:37,428
All right.
Thor, stop scratching.

181
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,364
Go in the house and get some coal
oil, put it on those chiggers.

182
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,366
Adam, you find
the sheep scissors.

183
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,669
I'm gonna cut yours
and jeb's hair tonight.

184
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:48,906
Jeb, we've always called you
by your right name- rand.

185
00:16:48,973 --> 00:16:50,908
Would you like to use
our name instead?

186
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:55,546
If you don't mind, I'd like to use my own name
- jeb rand.

187
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,220
All right, jeb.

188
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,310
You know how it was
after that.

189
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:29,547
Ma's idea worked like she
wanted it, pretty near.

190
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:31,949
Anyhow, we seemed
more like a family.

191
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:34,318
We were close,
the four of us.

192
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:37,387
That lasted
for a long time.

193
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,924
It lasted until that day
I rode into town.

194
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:42,192


195
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:01,445
detail, halt!


196
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,214
Right face!

197
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:06,450
About face!

198
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,919
<i>Order arms!</i>

199
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:12,289
Hey, what's all the shoutin' and
drum beatin' about? Ain't you heard?

200
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:16,727
The territory's fightin' Spain, and it looks
like we're gonna have a real shootin' war too.

201
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:23,501
Hi, jeb.
Good morning, doctor.

202
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,873
Hello, prentice. That's quite some
excitement you've got around here.

203
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,475
Sure is.
Gotta beat them spaniards.

204
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,711
Sure wish I could fight,
but dad won't let me.

205
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:36,580
Meanin' I won't lie about
his age so he can join.

206
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,082
I fought in one war. He don't
know what he's stayin' out of.

207
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,418
Here's your mail, jeb.
Thanks, bam.

208
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,754
That dress and petticoat
thorl sent for came in.

209
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:48,425
Hope it's what she wanted.
I've been keeping it for her.

210
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:51,294
She'll be obliged to you.
I'll tell her I saw you.

211
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,866
How's my credit, bam?
I need some tobacco.

212
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,868
Never heard anything wrong with
the credit on the callum ranch.

213
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,170
Thanks.

214
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:03,240
Mr. Rand?
Yes.

215
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:05,475
I heard him mention
the callum ranch.

216
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:09,747
I'm, uh, state provost, down
here to supervise recruiting.

217
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:14,885
Every outfit around about
here is sending in a quota.

218
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,087
One man apiece
to fight the spaniards.

219
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:21,959
I was sort of interested to see if
anyone was coming in from your ranch.

220
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,295
Oh, I guess this is what you
mean, sir. It came a little late.

221
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:28,331
Some of the outfits are sending
in every danged rider they've got.

222
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:30,968
Except the aged
and unfit.

223
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,404
We'll let you know tomorrow which one it's gonna be
- me or my brother adam.

224
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:36,506
Is that soon enough?
I guess so,

225
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,076
Unless you'd like the pleasure
of riding home tonight...

226
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:41,078
And telling the folks
you've just joined up.

227
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,984
Fill this out and sign it
and hand it in when you report.

228
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,220
If I'm the one that reports.
If not, adam will have to do it.

229
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:56,894
Give me two. The provost
seems bound and determined...

230
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,896
To get you
into this war.

231
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,398
It sort of appeared
that way to me too.

232
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,533
Who is that fella anyway?
What's his name?

233
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,869
heck, I figured
you knew him.

234
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:08,205
Ain't he some kind of kin
of yours? No kin of mine.

235
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:11,541
I have no kin. His name's
callum, just the same.

236
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,079
There's a whole slew of 'em up north.

237
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:33,731
<i>halt! Order arms!
</i>

238
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:36,634
<i>The recruits are ready to be
sworn in. Is that right, boys?</i>

239
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,271
All right.
Raise your right hands.

240
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:46,644
Repeat after me. I, a citizen of
the United States, do solemnly swear-

241
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:50,580
"I, a citizen of the United
States, do solemnly swear...

242
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,284
That I will bear true faith and
allegiance to the United States of america.

243
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:58,522
That I will bear true faith and allegiance
to the United States of america."

244
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,171
<i>is that package for me?
Yes.</i>

245
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,174
The dry goods you ordered.
Oh, good.

246
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,843
Maybe it's my dress.
Hey, adam?

247
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:23,414
<i>Hello? When you finish up
there, come on in the house.</i>

248
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:26,816
<i>I got some business to talk
over with you. All right.</i>

249
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:28,818
What is it?

250
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:38,762
<i>"... As a soldier in
the volunteer army...</i>

251
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:44,034
"of the United States of america for a period of two years, unless sooner discharged

252
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,270
The first company's
leaving in the morning.

253
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:49,106
I told him we'd let him
know by then. It's not fair.

254
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,642
Why can't they get soldiers from the big
ranches, where there have plenty of riders?

255
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,379
Can't be helped, sis. Them
spaniards has to be beat.

256
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:59,849
I won't let either of you go. I'll ride into
town and explain we need both of you here.

257
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:01,952
You can only keep
one of us at home, sis.

258
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:05,689
But you can help pick which one it's
gonna be. That's a job I don't want.

259
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:08,258
Should we tell ma,
or decide without her?

260
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:10,760
Decide for ourselves,
I say.

261
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:13,630
Tell her after.

262
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:15,632
Well, ad, what do you say?
How are we gonna settle it?

263
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,435
I'm agreeable
to anything you suggest.

264
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,671
All right, I'll draw numbers with
you, run you a race or cut cards.

265
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,673
That would be your way
of deciding it.

266
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:26,943
This isn't a game. It's
serious. I'm serious.

267
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:30,581
How about a toss? That's the
quickest. That's fine with me.

268
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:33,617
Then let me toss it.
Flip it high.

269
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,589
If it's tails, ad goes.

270
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:40,624
Heads, it's jeb.

271
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:54,204
It's heads.
Jeb, you're the one.

272
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:59,510
It was a fair toss.

273
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:01,512
So be it.

274
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:03,813
Well, there's no use
stalling around any longer.

275
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:07,117
Adam, will you cut out
a horse for me? Sure.

276
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:10,954
I'll get going tonight. I
better go to ma now and tell her.

277
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,789
Don't let anything
happen to you, jeb.

278
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:49,059
I couldn't stand that. If
anything happened to you-

279
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:51,061
Nothing's gonna happen, ma.

280
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:53,863
I'll come back.

281
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:56,567
Why, sure,
I know you will.

282
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:58,802
One of you had to go.

283
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:01,037
Perhaps it's best
this way.

284
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,352
Good-bye, jeb.

285
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:20,424
Good-bye, ma.

286
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:06,503
Good-bye, jeb.
So long.

287
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,605
Come home, jeb.

288
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,409
Until I do, maybe you'd
like this for a keepsake.

289
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:15,011
I guess it sort of
slipped out of your hand.

290
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,414
Right through the window too.

291
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,116
It didn't slip.
I threw it.

292
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:24,388
I don't blame you. You wanted to keep
adam here, so you lied about the toss.

293
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:28,024
I wanted to lie,
but I didn't.

294
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:31,060
If I had, it would've been
to keep you here,

295
00:25:31,128 --> 00:25:33,930
Not adam.

296
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:37,000
You felt that way too?
The same way I felt.

297
00:25:39,136 --> 00:25:41,705
I was supposed
to be your sister.

298
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,140
That's how it's been
ever since we were kids.

299
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:47,644
Only I stopped being
your sister,

300
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,213
And you've never been
my brother.

301
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:53,383
But I had to go on
every day pretending,

302
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:57,187
Watching you all day,
letting you touch me,

303
00:25:57,254 --> 00:25:59,189
And at night
going in my room,

304
00:25:59,256 --> 00:26:01,425
Lying there,
thinking about you.

305
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,828
I wish I had lied.

306
00:26:04,895 --> 00:26:08,198
I wish I had cheated about
the toss and kept you here.

307
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,240
Wait for me.
You know I will.

308
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:34,090
I'll leave him at the ace high livery
stable. Pick him up in the morning.

309
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:37,327
So long. Give them spaniards
heck for me. I'll do that.

310
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,323
Come on!

311
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:37,370
<i></i>

312
00:27:45,245 --> 00:27:47,347
Feel any better?

313
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,383
I feel all right. Well, I don't
know whether you were lucky or not.

314
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,819
You were sure
dreaming something.

315
00:27:52,886 --> 00:27:54,821
I've heard a lot
of fever chatter in my time.

316
00:27:54,888 --> 00:27:58,925
Don't bother with it much when it's
concerned with war, but yours was different.

317
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:01,928
Seemed to come from way back
somewhere when you were a kid.

318
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:05,715
- What'd I say?
- Something about boots and flashes of light.

319
00:28:05,783 --> 00:28:08,868
<i>Somebody hurt
or killed.</i>

320
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:12,305
<i>Does that mean anything
to you? I don't know.</i>

321
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:14,874
But you gotta tell me what I said,
doc. Every word. I wanna know.

322
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:17,210
Don't upset yourself.
Your fever's gone,

323
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:19,346
And the nightmare is with it
wherever they came from.

324
00:28:19,413 --> 00:28:21,881
<i>That leg is gonna
get you home.</i>

325
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,883
Home?

326
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:26,385


327
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:40,967


328
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:50,276


329
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:13,617
The stage is in!

330
00:29:16,153 --> 00:29:18,889
No, no. The provost wants to pay for it.

331
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:21,925
Oh, thank you, sir,
for the treat.

332
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:28,131
It's a pleasure to treat a man who takes
so little interest in today's occasion.

333
00:29:28,198 --> 00:29:31,902
See, personally, I too have
small interests in a doggone hero.

334
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:34,404
We think a great deal of jeb
out at the ranch.

335
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:38,174
Too bad they don't have a brass
band for a good cattle tally.

336
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:40,176
Understand you've been doing
a fine job out there.

337
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:42,178
I don't believe
I know your name, sir.

338
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:46,182
It's the same as yours
- callum. I'm the prosecutor at santa fe.

339
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,953
We're kin, you know. Then I'm
glad to make your acquaintance.

340
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:53,456
listen to that.

341
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:57,928
The ladies deprecate killing, but
my, how they admire a war hero.

342
00:29:57,995 --> 00:30:01,765
Jeb, you know, comes by
his instincts naturally.

343
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:05,384
He inherited them.
Is that so?

344
00:30:05,453 --> 00:30:08,287
I don't believe I ever talked to
anyone who knew jeb rand's kinfolk.

345
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:12,058
Sometime, take a little ride for
yourself up into glorietta township...

346
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:16,963
And see what the records have
to say about a family named rand.

347
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,032
Good luck.

348
00:30:22,202 --> 00:30:25,505
"for this meritorious
and exceptional action,

349
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,191
"I now award you
the medal of honor...

350
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:31,127
Of the United States
of america."

351
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:34,898


352
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,499
Good to see you, ma. My,
you're looking fine.

353
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:55,869
Hello, thor.
Hello, jeb.

354
00:30:58,572 --> 00:31:01,541
<i>Welcome home, jeb.
Thank you, adam.</i>

355
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:05,545
Glad to be home. Come on. Ride up here
with me. Let's get on out to the ranch.

356
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,515
Once you're sleepin' in your own bed
and eatin' at your own table, jeb,

357
00:31:08,582 --> 00:31:12,418
Maybe you'll forget all about the killin'
and shootin' the general talked so much about.

358
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:15,287
Don't have to forget it,
ma.

359
00:31:15,355 --> 00:31:17,289
Never think about it.

360
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:20,994
Giddap!

361
00:31:37,144 --> 00:31:40,312
I was savin' this
for thanksgiving.

362
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,449
I guess we're havin' a
kind of thanksgiving anyway.

363
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:50,823
Thank you. Welcome to my son, jeb.

364
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:52,825
Thank you, ma.

365
00:31:58,198 --> 00:32:01,434
To you, jeb,
and you must drink to me.

366
00:32:03,637 --> 00:32:05,772
<i>It would be fittin'
to have some music.</i>

367
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:10,076
Remember, boys?
"the londonderry air."

368
00:32:13,547 --> 00:32:15,548
Why, you used to
sing it.

369
00:32:21,288 --> 00:32:24,924


370
00:32:24,992 --> 00:32:30,396
once more, I'll awaken

371
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,766
the sweetness of

372
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:38,972
thy slumbering strain

373
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,942
in tears our last

374
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:47,680
farewell was taken

375
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:50,917
and now in tears

376
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:55,021
we meet again

377
00:32:56,356 --> 00:32:59,225
yet, even then

378
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:04,563
while peace was singing

379
00:33:04,632 --> 00:33:07,600
her halcyon song

380
00:33:07,668 --> 00:33:12,872
o'er land and sea

381
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,975
though joy and hope

382
00:33:16,043 --> 00:33:21,247
to others bring ye

383
00:33:21,314 --> 00:33:24,250
she only brought

384
00:33:24,317 --> 00:33:27,186
new tears

385
00:33:27,254 --> 00:33:31,090
to thee

386
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,934
Yes, jeb, you'll find
changes, and good ones too.

387
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:46,172
We got four new sections of the
richest fillery you ever saw.

388
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:50,309
I guess any kind of cattle talk's boresome
after you've been away from it for a while.

389
00:33:50,377 --> 00:33:52,478
Like a fellow
said to me today:

390
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:55,381
"they don't play
brass bands for cattlemen."

391
00:33:58,018 --> 00:34:01,353
Speaking of cattle, jeb, you're
entitled to read this tally.

392
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,059
You'll find all the operations in
here written down, clear and legal.

393
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:08,294
I don't have to read, ad.
I can trust your tally.

394
00:34:08,361 --> 00:34:10,362
Well, it's there
for you to see.

395
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,899
I've got your share
all marked off.

396
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:15,267
I call it the rand share.

397
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:21,574
Sit down, ad. Won't you
have some more coffee?

398
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:24,010
No, thanks.

399
00:34:24,078 --> 00:34:27,914
Well, it's been a big day. One
day's the same as another to me.

400
00:34:27,981 --> 00:34:29,916
I gotta be
in the saddle at sunup.

401
00:34:29,983 --> 00:34:32,919
Good night, ma.
Good night, son.

402
00:34:32,986 --> 00:34:35,554
Good night.
Good night, adam.

403
00:34:42,229 --> 00:34:45,198
I'll finish up. You go along. No, you-

404
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:48,868
Well, all right.
I'm all tuckered out.

405
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,141
Good night, jeb.
Good night, ma.

406
00:34:56,777 --> 00:35:00,146
All these trips to town
tire me out.

407
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:02,148
<i>jeb?</i>

408
00:35:04,384 --> 00:35:06,318
You know somethin'?

409
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:10,223
What?
There's a moon out.

410
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,994
Wait till
I get my shawl.

411
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:32,929
Jeb?

412
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,664
Jeb, sweetheart,
is something wrong?

413
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:37,867
Thor, we ought to go away.

414
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,669
We will.
I mean right now, tonight.

415
00:35:40,737 --> 00:35:42,671
Let's hitch up a horse
and not tell anyone.

416
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:45,074
We'll wake up a preacher over
in town and make him marry us.

417
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:47,076
You know I'll marry you.

418
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:49,279
What are we waiting for?

419
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:51,915
I want you
to come court me.

420
00:35:51,982 --> 00:35:55,518
I know that seems silly when
we grew up together, but...

421
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:57,753
I want to pretend
we didn't.

422
00:35:57,821 --> 00:36:00,323
That's why you've got
to come sparkin' me.

423
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:04,060
Do you mind? You can get
dressed up real fashionable.

424
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:07,931
So will I. I'll have two
chairs out in the gallery.

425
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:10,099
I'll bring out
some lemonade.

426
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,268
We'll sit there
and talk.

427
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:16,739
You can ask me if I'll let
you smoke, and I'll say yes.

428
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:19,075
I'll have
a piece of sewing.

429
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,077
What'll we talk about?

430
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:24,080
Oh, sort of
parlor talk.

431
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:28,184
The words will be like stitches that
sew and pull on our lives together.

432
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,954
After a while,
you can hold my hand.

433
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,595
You're not supposed to kiss
me till you bought a ring.

434
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:43,366
Oh, jeb,
can you understand?

435
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,469
Can you see it
in my way?

436
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:48,604
Thor, I've never
belonged here.

437
00:36:48,672 --> 00:36:53,142
I don't know why. I always have
a feeling something's after me.

438
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,478
It's a bad feeling
I can't explain.

439
00:36:55,545 --> 00:36:58,848
Lots of times I'm happy,
but it's still there.

440
00:36:58,915 --> 00:37:00,850
Thor, I've gotta be with you.

441
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,219
We've got to have a chance. Let's
get away before something happens.

442
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,221
Please, sweetheart.

443
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,390
We're gonna get married,
jeb.

444
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,993
We're not gonna spend the rest
of our lives doing crazy things...

445
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,928
Because you think
something's gonna happen.

446
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:16,966
We're not gonna run away at night
like a couple of stagecoach robbers.

447
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,968
I love you, jeb.

448
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,571
But if we're gonna get married,
can't it be the way I say?

449
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:26,109
Please, sweetheart?

450
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,715
I only hope
it turns out that way.

451
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:43,159
after that, I had to be alone
and think things out.

452
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,396
We hadn't really quarreled,
and yet somehow we had.

453
00:37:46,463 --> 00:37:50,099
It seemed as if we couldn't
understand each other anymore.

454
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,468
One day, I rode up
into butte country.

455
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,238
Came straight to this place,
just as if I'd known the way.

456
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:25,351
There was something in my life
as ruined as that house.

457
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:28,487
That house was myself.

458
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:30,556
I'd seen it
a million times before-

459
00:38:30,624 --> 00:38:33,392
The fireplace,

460
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,394
The trap door.

461
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:50,276
Out back,
there was some cattle bones.

462
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,988
And then as I walked around the
side, I came on some unmarked graves.

463
00:39:03,256 --> 00:39:05,291
All of the sudden,
I couldn't breathe.

464
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:11,730
If that house was me, what part
of me was buried in those graves?

465
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:11,974
Some folks has me beat.
When there's work to be done,

466
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:15,477
That's the time they decide to go
ridin' all over the countryside.

467
00:40:15,545 --> 00:40:18,714
Honey, I was worried about you.
We didn't know where you were.

468
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:20,883
I'm sorry.
I just took a little ride.

469
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,885
How long since
you've had something to eat?

470
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,988
I don't know, but I'm not
hungry. I'll fix you some coffee.

471
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,657
That'll be fine.
Right now I wanna see ma.

472
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,937
You got no more sense
than a duck.

473
00:40:41,004 --> 00:40:42,972
Well, I had sense enough
to come home.

474
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,908
Why, thor was fit to be
tied worrying over you.

475
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,010
I was sort of
worried myself.

476
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:52,148
I got halfway lost. I strayed
away up in that rimrock country,

477
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,150
Up bear paw butte way.

478
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:59,088
Bear paw butte? Now, what
crazy thing made you do that?

479
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,858
You and thor
have a nip up?

480
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:04,260
Thor had nothing to do
with my going.

481
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,332
I wanna ask you
something, ma.

482
00:41:09,399 --> 00:41:11,334
I've been wondering about
that old ranch up there.

483
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:14,470
a goat couldn't live
in that range.

484
00:41:14,537 --> 00:41:16,472
A burro would starve.

485
00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:19,541
People lived there once
though.

486
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:22,011
You know the ranch
I mean?

487
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,147
I just remembered.
Seems to me there was...

488
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:27,750
Someplace up there
long ago.

489
00:41:27,817 --> 00:41:29,818
Seems to me
I've been there before.

490
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:33,122
Ma callum, does that ranch
have to do with me?

491
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,657
Don't ask me questions,
jeb.

492
00:41:35,725 --> 00:41:38,027
Did I come from there
as a boy?

493
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,329
Is that where you took me
from all those years ago?

494
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,331
Is that why
I remember it?

495
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:47,469
I told you not to look
backward. Look ahead.

496
00:41:47,537 --> 00:41:51,140
I obeyed you.
I've lived like you said.

497
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,943
All my life, I've known
I didn't really belong here.

498
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:58,347
I couldn't love. I couldn't
return your kindness.

499
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,883
Is there something
the matter with me?

500
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,919
I wanna understand, ma.
You've gotta tell me.

501
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,422
There's nothing the matter
with you, jeb.

502
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:08,925
That ranch might mean
more to me than it does to you.

503
00:42:08,992 --> 00:42:11,593
Anyway, I get upset
talking about it.

504
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:13,963
A person's gotta find
his own answers.

505
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,499
We're alone, each of us,
and each in a different way.

506
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:21,203
I won't be alone.
I'm gonna marry thor.

507
00:42:21,271 --> 00:42:23,205
I want you to.

508
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:26,775
But when you do, you've
got the future to live for.

509
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:30,112
I've got the past
to live with too.

510
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,215
My children will have to live
with it. Stop vexing me, jeb brand.

511
00:42:33,283 --> 00:42:35,851
I'm giving you my daughter
for your wife.

512
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:39,888
Isn't that enough for you? Doesn't
that show you that you're loved?

513
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,991
Go away from me with
your doubts and your-

514
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,294
Your bear paw butte
and your crazy long rides.

515
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,964
Leave off vexing me.

516
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:49,999
You told me once
not to question you,

517
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,369
But the questions
keep coming back.

518
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:56,372
If you won't answer me, I'll have to
look somewhere else for the answer.

519
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,790
<i>Goin' out, jeb?</i>

520
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:17,893
Thought I'd go and see if mr. Dingle's
faro game is still as crooked as ever.

521
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:20,496
<i>Good idea.
What'd you say?</i>

522
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:23,399
I said it was
a good idea.

523
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:26,768
How'd you like to take two or three thousand
dollars along, stake you in the game?

524
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,075
Maybe one of us is crazy,
but I don't seem to follow you.

525
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:36,412
The tally book would've made it kind of
simple if you'd taken the trouble to read it.

526
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,981
That's why I gave it to you
when you came home.

527
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,850
Only now, I got
this year's crop added.

528
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:44,153
Two or three thousand would be no
more than your share of the profits.

529
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:47,256
A third
to each of us,

530
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,258
The way ma wants it.

531
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:53,329
That's mighty generous. More than
I deserve, least ways expected.

532
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,698
Thanks. Here's something
else you don't know.

533
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:03,539
All the time you were in the army,
we've been banking money for you.

534
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:09,245
Fifteen hundred dollars. There's
just one thing wrong with it, jeb.

535
00:44:09,312 --> 00:44:11,947
That money came out of the
ranch, and you didn't earn it.

536
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:13,949
I've been workin'
my share and yours too.

537
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:16,318
I don't aim to
keep on doin' that.

538
00:44:16,386 --> 00:44:19,121
<i>I never asked you to. No, but
you never tried to help me either.</i>

539
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,890
Your foot's been well for a month,
and you've been drawin' that money...

540
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:24,793
For lyin' in the shade.

541
00:44:24,861 --> 00:44:29,331
I was lucky if I didn't have six of my riders
stretched out alongside you playin' pitch.

542
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:31,733
Oh, sure, I know
you were a hero once,

543
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:36,105
But I've had my belly
full of that too.

544
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,574
We don't pay off
in medals around here.

545
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,511
It was too bad
I came home at all.

546
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,846
If I hadn't, you would've had
the ranch and the tally money...

547
00:44:44,914 --> 00:44:46,848
And my share of everything
all to yourself.

548
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:51,687
This "share and share alike" doesn't sit
any better with me than it does with you.

549
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:55,257
I'm thinkin'
the same way you are.

550
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,259
This ranch isn't big enough
to hold the two of us.

551
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:01,464
There's a way
we can settle that.

552
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:04,850
Jeb, you promised me
there'd be no trouble.

553
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:07,085
I wanna hear
what he has to say.

554
00:45:07,153 --> 00:45:09,888
How can we settle it?
I'll buy you out.

555
00:45:09,956 --> 00:45:13,492
Suppose I don't wanna sell?
Then you buy me out.

556
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,829
Now, you know I can't
do that. Adam, please.

557
00:45:16,896 --> 00:45:21,032
Jeb, don't say anything more.
Won't you do that much for me?

558
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,402
Thor,
you keep out of this.

559
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,638
Well, what's your notion,
if you don't like mine?

560
00:45:26,706 --> 00:45:29,708
When I went to war,
we settled with a toss.

561
00:45:29,776 --> 00:45:31,710
I kept this.

562
00:45:31,778 --> 00:45:33,712
Maybe if it suits you,
we can spin it again.

563
00:45:35,081 --> 00:45:37,315
There might be some luck
in it for me this time.

564
00:45:37,384 --> 00:45:41,219
I'll toss you. My share against
yours. One of us stays, and one goes.

565
00:45:41,287 --> 00:45:43,789
Oh, you can't!
You either!

566
00:45:43,857 --> 00:45:46,892
It's wrong and crazy.

567
00:45:46,959 --> 00:45:51,096
Ever since we were little, we've all been here together
- the three of us.

568
00:45:51,163 --> 00:45:54,266
This is no way to change it
if it's going to be changed.

569
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:56,334
One toss.

570
00:45:56,403 --> 00:45:58,637
You wanna spin it?
Adam, I beg you!

571
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:00,639
And you, jeb,
don't do it!

572
00:46:00,707 --> 00:46:04,009
Winner take all.
One toss.

573
00:46:04,076 --> 00:46:06,011
Call it.
Heads.

574
00:46:11,317 --> 00:46:13,519
I might've known
that cartwheel was bad luck.

575
00:46:15,154 --> 00:46:17,423
Well, I'll be ridin'
in town.

576
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,625
I'll hire a rig tomorrow
and come back for my things.

577
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:24,362
No, you won't.
You ain't got no things,

578
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:26,498
Exceptin'
what you're wearin'...

579
00:46:26,566 --> 00:46:29,200
And this!

580
00:47:44,961 --> 00:47:47,129
Tomorrow I'm coming back,

581
00:47:47,196 --> 00:47:49,331
And you're coming with me.

582
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,333
If he tries to stop me,
I'll kill him.

583
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:42,450
ma'll never let you do this.
Maybe she'll have to.

584
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:44,953
Then I'll go with him
in the morning.

585
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:47,555
When he comes, I'll be ready. You'd never.

586
00:48:47,623 --> 00:48:49,925
Not if it meant
leavin' the ranch.

587
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:53,662
The ranch isn't everything
to me. It isn't a husband.

588
00:48:53,729 --> 00:48:57,166
"the ranch be a husband."
you're talkin' crazy.

589
00:48:57,233 --> 00:48:59,234
It's been a wife
to you, adam,

590
00:48:59,302 --> 00:49:01,236
Because you don't have
a wife.

591
00:49:01,304 --> 00:49:05,507
You just have the ranch.
Well, I don't belong to it.

592
00:49:05,574 --> 00:49:09,411
You can take me off that dogeared
tally book you carry around.

593
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,714
You hate me then?

594
00:49:12,782 --> 00:49:14,716
I love you.

595
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:18,153
I always thought the three
of us would never be apart.

596
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,889
Three. Three!
You're always sayin' that!

597
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,891
But why does he count?
It's you and me.

598
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:27,762
Now you're the one that's talkin'
crazy. I want a home of my own.

599
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:31,300
Grant callum knew him.
Knew his people too.

600
00:49:31,367 --> 00:49:33,969
Told me to look up the records
in glorietta county.

601
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,005
And did you? Sure I did,
and I found something.

602
00:49:37,073 --> 00:49:39,641
A family named rand
did live there once.

603
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:41,844
I found out
enough for me-

604
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:44,279
A reason why I'll
never let you marry him.

605
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:47,115
I don't care
what your reason is.

606
00:49:47,183 --> 00:49:49,784
You're talkin' like
a back-fence gossip.

607
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:52,554
Do you think that kind of
talk means anything to me?

608
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:54,957
Nothing in the world
can change the way I feel.

609
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:57,960
I always knew
you cared for him.

610
00:49:59,662 --> 00:50:03,465
I guess...
I never knew how much.

611
00:50:03,532 --> 00:50:06,468
Looks as if we're gonna have
to set things right.

612
00:50:06,535 --> 00:50:08,503
You'll-
you'll go after him, then?

613
00:50:08,571 --> 00:50:10,505
You'll ride in town
and bring him back?

614
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:15,543
I'll do it.
I'll ride in town tonight.

615
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:17,545
<i></i>

616
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:31,360
Mr. Dingle, can you take
this man's I.O.U.?

617
00:50:32,461 --> 00:50:34,396
Yes, I'll take it.

618
00:50:36,232 --> 00:50:38,367
Now throw him out.
Yes.

619
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,943
Keep your hands off me,
will ya?

620
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:02,224
What's the matter, jake? Don't
you take money in here anymore?

621
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,393
Any money you put on
this bar is counterfeit.

622
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,594
I'm saving you
for the wheel.

623
00:51:06,662 --> 00:51:10,432
Did you run into a fellow who
nearly convinced you? Well, he tried.

624
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:13,668
You know, I flipped this dollar
twice with adam. I lost both times.

625
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:16,305
Last time, I went to war.
This time, I left the ranch.

626
00:51:16,372 --> 00:51:19,607
You left the ranch?
You mean that?

627
00:51:19,675 --> 00:51:22,510
Maybe you've played
into a cold deck.

628
00:51:22,578 --> 00:51:24,646
Well, I guess it's all
for the best. Oh, sure.

629
00:51:24,713 --> 00:51:28,183
A man's luck's bound to change
sometime. You appear lucky to me.

630
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:32,454
Don't you want some action for this
dollar? It's kind of a keepsake.

631
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:35,357
Oh. Well, many a man's been
down to his last dollar...

632
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,759
Before the change
does come.

633
00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:41,363
I guess you just
want this dollar.

634
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:45,267
All right,
go ahead and take it.

635
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,598
Hey, jeb, you won.

636
00:51:59,665 --> 00:52:02,567
Let it ride. Oh, no. Too
many angles at this game.

637
00:52:02,635 --> 00:52:04,569
I'd rather play poker.

638
00:52:17,182 --> 00:52:19,451
You've had a run of good luck,
jeb. Why don't you pull out?

639
00:52:19,518 --> 00:52:21,453
Oh, once more.
Oh, brother.

640
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,723
Luck's sure riding on your shoulder.
Probably clean this place out.

641
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,725
Oh, I've got a feeling
you're through.

642
00:52:26,792 --> 00:52:30,995
Well, I've got about $1,500 here
that says you've got a wrong feeling.

643
00:52:31,063 --> 00:52:33,064
Joe, get me a new deck.

644
00:52:51,617 --> 00:52:53,851
Well...

645
00:52:53,919 --> 00:52:56,220
There it is.

646
00:52:56,289 --> 00:52:59,190
I'll tell you what I'd do with that money
if I were you. Don't tell me. Let me guess.

647
00:52:59,258 --> 00:53:02,093
I'd buy into this business.
I'll sell you a piece of it.

648
00:53:02,161 --> 00:53:04,729
You don't mean that?
Yes, I do.

649
00:53:04,797 --> 00:53:06,864
You know why?
Why?

650
00:53:06,932 --> 00:53:09,534
Well, because
people trust you...

651
00:53:09,602 --> 00:53:12,704
And, well,
I'm just honest jake dingle.

652
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,374
You know, I might
take you up on that.

653
00:53:16,442 --> 00:53:18,376
I'll be looking for
a business by and by.

654
00:53:18,444 --> 00:53:22,013
Well, you think it over and let me know.
We'd make a great combination, you and myself.

655
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,050
And if you do come in, I'll
teach you how to handle cards.

656
00:53:26,118 --> 00:53:28,085
It don't hurt anything.

657
00:53:28,153 --> 00:53:30,655
Good night.
Good night, partner.

658
00:53:30,723 --> 00:53:33,024
And take good care
of that money.

659
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:00,918
as I walked out
on the streets

660
00:54:00,986 --> 00:54:02,987
of laredo

661
00:54:03,055 --> 00:54:08,360
I walked out on
laredo one day

662
00:54:08,427 --> 00:54:11,095
I spied a cow puncher

663
00:54:11,163 --> 00:54:14,298
wrapped up in white linen

664
00:54:14,367 --> 00:54:19,303
wrapped in white linen
as cold as the clay

665
00:54:19,372 --> 00:54:25,276
beat the drum slowly
and play the fife lowly

666
00:54:25,344 --> 00:54:30,648
play the dead March
as you carry me along

667
00:54:30,716 --> 00:54:36,488
take me out to the prairie
and lay the sod over me

668
00:54:36,555 --> 00:54:41,959
for I'm a poor cowboy
and I know I've done wrong

669
00:54:42,027 --> 00:54:43,961


670
00:54:54,056 --> 00:54:56,925
and lay the sod over me

671
00:54:59,028 --> 00:55:01,563


672
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:55,500
<i>Adam.</i>

673
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,785
Now, let us continue.

674
00:57:53,852 --> 00:57:56,420
I disagree with the learned
corner. I still maintain...

675
00:57:56,488 --> 00:57:59,591
We're a legal body,
properly impaneled.

676
00:57:59,658 --> 00:58:02,860
Sit down, grant.
This is my hearin'.

677
00:58:02,928 --> 00:58:07,131
I don't need no county prosecutor
to tell me how to run it.

678
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:09,366
Furthermore,
since it so happens...

679
00:58:09,434 --> 00:58:12,303
Said prosecutor's name
is callum,

680
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:16,007
I wouldn't want to say he's prejudiced
'cause I'm clean-minded, I am.

681
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,743
It's my duty to see
the law administered...

682
00:58:18,811 --> 00:58:21,245
Regardless of family
or anything else.

683
00:58:23,548 --> 00:58:26,584
Gentlemen, I swear from
the bottom of my heart...

684
00:58:26,651 --> 00:58:29,487
<i>I never felt more like
quitting my job than right now.</i>

685
00:58:29,554 --> 00:58:32,790
Because I well know what
this case may cost a family-

686
00:58:32,858 --> 00:58:35,510
A sorrowing mother
and sister-

687
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:38,279
<i>Who have already lost
one son, one brother...</i>

688
00:58:40,148 --> 00:58:43,351
And, if my guess is right,
may lose another to the law.

689
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:50,892
Miss callum,

690
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:52,960
On the night
in question,

691
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:55,963
Did you witness a quarrel
between your brother and jeb rand?

692
00:58:58,133 --> 00:59:00,201
Yes, I did.

693
00:59:00,269 --> 00:59:03,905
And did you hear the accused utter
any threat with regard to adam?

694
00:59:06,158 --> 00:59:08,092
Yes.

695
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,228
<i>You may repeat
what you heard.</i>

696
00:59:13,399 --> 00:59:16,000
Jeb said he was comin' back
next day to get me...

697
00:59:17,536 --> 00:59:20,405
To take me with him
and marry me.

698
00:59:30,766 --> 00:59:33,568
He said if adam tried to
stop him, he'd kill him.

699
00:59:41,343 --> 00:59:44,479
Perhaps you fellers
might like a spot of tea.

700
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:47,982
now, here's the size of it.

701
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,952
Here's two men that had
no use want for each other.

702
00:59:51,019 --> 00:59:54,689
All that's been testified, but that
ain't what we're here to decide.

703
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,659
It looks like jeb
shot him down like grant said.

704
00:59:57,726 --> 01:00:02,330
Hold your horses. It's grant's
word against jeb's, he way I see it.

705
01:00:02,397 --> 01:00:06,450
Jeb never was no murderer. I figure
there's plenty of doubt on both sides.

706
01:00:06,518 --> 01:00:09,053
The heck you say. Nobody
can get along with ad callum.

707
01:00:09,121 --> 01:00:12,056
Let's get somethin' done. I gotta
get home and look after my stall.

708
01:00:14,259 --> 01:00:16,427
Shut up!

709
01:00:16,494 --> 01:00:20,164
You fellows saw the general
pin a medal on jeb.

710
01:00:20,232 --> 01:00:23,101
Ah, he weren't decoratin'
no ambusher...

711
01:00:23,168 --> 01:00:26,104
But a man that fought
fair and square for his country.

712
01:00:26,171 --> 01:00:29,373
It don't stand to reason that a man that
shot down a dozen fellows in battle...

713
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:32,276
Would shoot down his own brother
without givin' him a chance.

714
01:00:32,344 --> 01:00:34,779
If he had to drill him,
he'd do it right.

715
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:38,049
Uh-uh-uh! And if he done it
right, then it ain't no killin',

716
01:00:38,117 --> 01:00:40,051
But a lawful fight.

717
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,553
And hereabouts we ain't
so danged uncivilized...

718
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:45,723
A man can't win a lawful fight without
gettin' his neck in a noose for it.

719
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:48,926
Pass the tea.

720
01:01:01,073 --> 01:01:03,141
Thank you.

721
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:12,817
May I speak to you
before you go, mrs. Callum?

722
01:01:14,486 --> 01:01:17,755
I know you don't hold with the
verdict of the jury, but it was fair.

723
01:01:17,823 --> 01:01:19,991
I never murdered adam.

724
01:01:21,426 --> 01:01:24,262
You'll be shorthanded
at the ranch.

725
01:01:24,329 --> 01:01:28,266
If you'll permit me, I'd be happy
to come back and help you out.

726
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:30,935
I make this offer
most sincerely.

727
01:01:31,003 --> 01:01:33,204
Get away from me,
jeb rand.

728
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,907
I know how you
must feel about me,

729
01:01:35,974 --> 01:01:39,243
But I was hoping that
in time I could change that.

730
01:01:39,311 --> 01:01:42,814
It's too late
to change anything.

731
01:01:42,881 --> 01:01:46,050
Mother, let's go.

732
01:01:46,118 --> 01:01:48,619
No. I'll
have my say.

733
01:01:48,687 --> 01:01:50,855
You may have cleared
yourself in there,

734
01:01:50,923 --> 01:01:52,924
But not with me.

735
01:01:52,991 --> 01:01:55,793
With me you're walkin'
up the gallows steps.

736
01:01:55,861 --> 01:01:59,797
I built that gallows.
I tied the noose.

737
01:01:59,865 --> 01:02:02,133
All the love I had
for you is dead.

738
01:02:04,937 --> 01:02:07,171
Stay out of my sight.

739
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:11,309
If you cross my section line,
I'll set the dogs on you.

740
01:02:11,376 --> 01:02:14,378
Is that the way
you feel?

741
01:02:29,895 --> 01:02:32,830
you'd made pretty clear
how you felt,

742
01:02:32,898 --> 01:02:35,632
So that fall
I put in with jake.

743
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:39,570
I found out how dull gambling could be
when I stood on the other side of the table.

744
01:02:39,637 --> 01:02:42,340
Once or twice we got some news about you
- come on, baby!

745
01:02:42,407 --> 01:02:44,342
How you'd been sick,

746
01:02:44,409 --> 01:02:47,444
How you were living out at
the ranch and not seeing anyone.

747
01:02:47,512 --> 01:02:50,681
I watched for you to come
into town, but you never did.

748
01:02:50,749 --> 01:02:54,518
It was fall again before I heard
young prentice, the storekeeper's son,

749
01:02:54,586 --> 01:02:57,521
Was taking you and your mother
to the dance.

750
01:02:57,589 --> 01:03:01,625


751
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:09,367
do-si your daughters
and do-si your old men

752
01:03:09,434 --> 01:03:13,737
do-si your brothers to the
ball and do-si back home

753
01:03:17,075 --> 01:03:19,676
allemande left
and the old left hand

754
01:03:19,744 --> 01:03:22,747


755
01:03:25,116 --> 01:03:27,318
meet your partner
and promenade

756
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,654
it's on fire
and I don't care

757
01:03:29,721 --> 01:03:32,723
and park your gal
in an easy chair

758
01:03:35,126 --> 01:03:37,261
Would you like a glass
of punch? I'd love it.

759
01:03:37,329 --> 01:03:39,330
Excuse me a minute.
Thanks.

760
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:55,479
and now, ladies and gentlemen,
the next will be la varsouviana.

761
01:03:57,015 --> 01:03:59,583
May I have the pleasure?
Please go away.

762
01:03:59,651 --> 01:04:01,785
Better dance, or people
will look at you.

763
01:04:01,853 --> 01:04:04,855
I'd rather have people look at me
than dance with somebody I hate.

764
01:04:04,923 --> 01:04:08,326


765
01:04:49,901 --> 01:04:52,536
What a coward you are.

766
01:04:54,539 --> 01:04:56,974
A coward wouldn't have
come here to dance with you.

767
01:05:14,026 --> 01:05:17,161
hold it. All right, folks,
that's enough of our slow dance.

768
01:05:17,229 --> 01:05:19,330
Here's a chance
to swing your ladies,

769
01:05:19,398 --> 01:05:23,401
So get your partners
for a chicken reel.

770
01:05:23,468 --> 01:05:28,205


771
01:05:29,741 --> 01:05:33,944
Uh... You saw thor dancin'
with jeb, didn't you?

772
01:05:34,012 --> 01:05:37,214
Why, yes. Come on, son. Let's
you and I have a little talk.

773
01:05:37,282 --> 01:05:40,484
Now, you forced her. Jeb rand, the
man she hates most in the world,

774
01:05:40,552 --> 01:05:42,853
Forced her to dance with him.
I was getting her some punch.

775
01:05:42,921 --> 01:05:45,356
You're escorting her this
evening, aren't you? Yes.

776
01:05:45,424 --> 01:05:48,692
Did you bring her here so she could be
insulted? No. I wouldn't let that happen.

777
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:52,096
Well, it's happened.
What are you gonna do about it?

778
01:05:52,164 --> 01:05:54,131
Pardon us, gentlemen.

779
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:06,594
Mr. Callum, all this
started long ago.

780
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:10,364
It isn't my fight. Then you're
not the man I took you for.

781
01:06:10,432 --> 01:06:12,766
I'll do what's right.

782
01:06:12,834 --> 01:06:16,770
If you let him get away with it,
she'll never speak to you again.

783
01:06:16,838 --> 01:06:20,675
Did she say that? If she
didn't, she's thinking it.

784
01:06:20,742 --> 01:06:23,544
And there's something else
she's thinking of.

785
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,781
It's the death
of her brother.

786
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:34,388
Mr. Callum, sir...
I'm not much good with a gun.

787
01:06:34,456 --> 01:06:37,124
Maybe you'll have some help.

788
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:40,394
Go up to the alley.

789
01:06:40,462 --> 01:06:43,397
If he's an honest wheel, you'll
find him in the back room.

790
01:06:43,465 --> 01:06:45,666
Shoot him
through the window.

791
01:06:45,734 --> 01:06:49,470
No, sir, I-
I can't do that.

792
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:52,106
But I'll make him
come out to me.

793
01:07:12,093 --> 01:07:14,828
What's the matter, jake?
Couldn't you find any partner?

794
01:07:14,896 --> 01:07:17,097
You found one you
shouldn't have- thor.

795
01:07:17,165 --> 01:07:19,900
Young prentice is comin' over
after you for it. Prentice?

796
01:07:19,968 --> 01:07:23,738
He's on his way over here now. Get
the drop on him, jeb. Go on out front.

797
01:07:25,807 --> 01:07:28,409
First adam, now prentice.

798
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,811
<i>Man, you
gotta get going.</i>

799
01:07:30,879 --> 01:07:33,547
I don't wanna get
the drop on him, jake.

800
01:07:33,615 --> 01:07:35,583
What are you gonna do?

801
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:37,851
Step out in the alley
and make myself scarce.

802
01:07:50,865 --> 01:07:52,866
<i>Mr. Rand.
What do you want?</i>

803
01:07:52,934 --> 01:07:56,470
I've come because
of what you did to thorley.

804
01:07:56,538 --> 01:07:59,573
Go on home, prentice.
I don't want to hurt you.

805
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:02,576
Defend yourself,
mr. Rand.

806
01:09:23,825 --> 01:09:27,461
I wouldn't try that
if I were you, grant.

807
01:09:33,001 --> 01:09:35,369
Let's get him
in the office.

808
01:09:57,592 --> 01:10:00,394


809
01:10:06,668 --> 01:10:10,438
I- I did it
for thorley.

810
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,975
I'm sorry, prentice.

811
01:10:27,221 --> 01:10:30,290
it was self-defense
just as they said,

812
01:10:30,358 --> 01:10:34,394
Yet he was one more part of
the mystery of people hating me.

813
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:37,431
How I saw the boots
of the pallbearers,

814
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:39,700
The flashes of light.

815
01:10:42,904 --> 01:10:47,374
I had that feeling some lost and
awful thing come over me again.

816
01:11:05,226 --> 01:11:08,128
I wasn't sure whether killing
prentice was my fault,

817
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:11,465
Whether it was due to some
badness locked up in me.

818
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:14,001
But I was sure
of my love for you.

819
01:11:14,068 --> 01:11:17,571
That was the only hope
and the only answer.

820
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:21,275
If love could come out of all this,
we might still have some chance.

821
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,277
We might live.

822
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:26,497
Right then I knew
I had to have you.

823
01:11:26,931 --> 01:11:30,951
I'd have to climb across
two graves to get to you,

824
01:11:31,019 --> 01:11:34,087
But nothing in the world
could hold me back.

825
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:52,273
Who's that comin'?

826
01:11:54,976 --> 01:11:57,178
It's jeb rand.

827
01:11:58,813 --> 01:12:01,549
He's comin'
to call on me.

828
01:12:01,616 --> 01:12:05,419
Jeb rand?
Callin' on you?

829
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,788
I knew he'd come.

830
01:12:07,855 --> 01:12:10,157
I've been expectin' him.

831
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:18,865
You've no right to expect him,
much less to see him.

832
01:12:20,902 --> 01:12:23,304
I'm askin' him in.

833
01:12:38,853 --> 01:12:42,656
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Won't you come in?

834
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:44,725
Thank you.

835
01:12:47,061 --> 01:12:49,630
It was kind of you
to receive me.

836
01:12:50,732 --> 01:12:53,267
Please sit down.

837
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:55,336
Thank you.

838
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:02,843
Would you like
some coffee?

839
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:05,112
I don't want to put you
to any trouble.

840
01:13:05,179 --> 01:13:08,649
Oh, it's no trouble.
We were just going to have some.

841
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:12,085
I'm sorry we have
nothing else to offer.

842
01:13:12,153 --> 01:13:14,788
In this house all we have
is a little wine.

843
01:13:14,856 --> 01:13:18,158
That's just for christmas
and holidays.

844
01:13:18,226 --> 01:13:21,328
Seems to me I remember
something about that wine.

845
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:29,102
That's a music box
ma had sent from santa fe.

846
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:34,241
I know. It plays
"the londonderry air."

847
01:13:36,978 --> 01:13:41,248


848
01:14:02,153 --> 01:14:07,123
It's an old-fashioned tune.
Some people don't care for it.

849
01:14:07,191 --> 01:14:09,359


850
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:20,070
May I smoke?
Or would that annoy you?

851
01:14:20,137 --> 01:14:22,138
No, of course not.

852
01:14:38,957 --> 01:14:43,727
This is a sampler I'm makin'.
I'm not very good at it.

853
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:52,936
Here we are courting, the way
you asked me to long ago.

854
01:14:53,004 --> 01:14:55,939
But it's all different.

855
01:14:56,007 --> 01:14:59,643
<i>You sitting there.
Me smoking, you sewing.</i>

856
01:15:01,646 --> 01:15:04,615
Just like
any ordinary people.

857
01:15:04,682 --> 01:15:07,550
It's worse than fighting
or yelling in the street.

858
01:15:11,623 --> 01:15:15,225
- Don't you want your coffee?
- No, thanks.

859
01:15:15,292 --> 01:15:20,130
Perhaps later. Why don't you sit
down in the comfortable chair?

860
01:15:20,197 --> 01:15:23,399
Company always
uses that one.

861
01:15:48,392 --> 01:15:51,862
I tried to figure out what crazy
game you were playing with me,

862
01:15:51,929 --> 01:15:53,864
And I couldn't.

863
01:15:53,931 --> 01:15:57,167
But I knew I'd play it out
with you right till the end.

864
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,736
Am I seeing things?
Well, I declare!

865
01:16:44,165 --> 01:16:47,133
Good night, jeb
I'll see you tomorrow?

866
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:49,202
Of course.

867
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,958
Thor.

868
01:17:15,062 --> 01:17:17,698
<i>Thor! Come here!</i>

869
01:17:37,284 --> 01:17:39,452
- What is it?
- Come closer.

870
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:56,269
Turn the lamp up.

871
01:17:59,073 --> 01:18:03,309
That's right.
I want to look at you.

872
01:18:03,377 --> 01:18:05,311
I haven't changed, mother.

873
01:18:05,379 --> 01:18:10,017
What have I taught you that showed
you how to bring dishonor on us?

874
01:18:10,084 --> 01:18:13,153
I've brought you
no dishonor.

875
01:18:14,722 --> 01:18:18,324
Jeb gave me this tonight.

876
01:18:18,392 --> 01:18:20,493
I'm going to marry him,
mother.

877
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:25,131
What's in this that I don't
understand? Do you love him then?

878
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:29,670
I have only one thought
every minute of my life:

879
01:18:29,737 --> 01:18:31,672
How much I hate him.

880
01:18:31,739 --> 01:18:33,840
But you wear his ring.

881
01:18:37,278 --> 01:18:42,115
If I were a man,
I would've killed him long ago.

882
01:18:42,183 --> 01:18:45,318
After adam's death.

883
01:18:45,386 --> 01:18:49,690
Then he killed prentice
and came courtin' me.

884
01:18:49,757 --> 01:18:53,126
All of a sudden,
killin' wasn't enough.

885
01:18:53,194 --> 01:18:55,495
I had to have more-

886
01:18:55,563 --> 01:18:58,531
Much more- to use up
all the hate I have in me.

887
01:19:01,936 --> 01:19:05,472
Thor, I'll sell this place.
I'll go away.

888
01:19:05,539 --> 01:19:07,908
I won't stay here
and see this thing happen.

889
01:19:09,777 --> 01:19:12,646
Perhaps that may be best.

890
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:17,550
You go away for a while.
We'll be together again soon.

891
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:20,053
No woman ever lived...

892
01:19:20,121 --> 01:19:23,824
Who could go through
with what you're planning.

893
01:19:23,891 --> 01:19:26,727
No woman but me.

894
01:19:26,794 --> 01:19:30,897
'cause it's taken all my life
to teach me what he is.

895
01:19:30,965 --> 01:19:34,234
He put shame
and grief on us,

896
01:19:34,301 --> 01:19:38,571
And now he'd like to squeeze out
the last drop of it by havin' me.

897
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:43,777
He wants me...

898
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:46,279
And I'll marry him.

899
01:19:46,347 --> 01:19:51,284
That moment when he thinks he
has me, he'll lose everything...

900
01:19:51,352 --> 01:19:54,788
Because that's when
I'm going to kill him.

901
01:19:56,991 --> 01:19:59,793
For richer,
for poorer.

902
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:01,795
For richer, for poorer.

903
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:03,797
In sickness
and in health.

904
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:05,799
In sickness and in health.

905
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:08,068
Until death
do us part.

906
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,203
Until death do us part.

907
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,317
What made you do that?

908
01:20:24,385 --> 01:20:28,755
I don't know. Such fine young
folks, and nobody at the wedding.

909
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:35,028
I have a surprise for you.
I've bought you a house.

910
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:37,097
All right, charlie.

911
01:20:48,926 --> 01:20:52,329
Well, now you've seen it.
That's why I sent for you.

912
01:20:52,396 --> 01:20:57,066
Bein' as we're all callums here, I don't
have to tell you what we're gonna do about it.

913
01:20:57,134 --> 01:21:00,337
Sure enough, you'll get
yourself in trouble, and us too.

914
01:21:00,404 --> 01:21:03,306
Yeah. Times have changed
since all this started, grant.

915
01:21:03,374 --> 01:21:05,608
You can't ride herd
on the law no more.

916
01:21:05,676 --> 01:21:08,745
You're telling me about the law? No, sir.

917
01:21:10,414 --> 01:21:14,217
You thinkin' like him, that
you're not goin'? That's right.

918
01:21:17,388 --> 01:21:20,357
I think we're all goin'.

919
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:52,455
When I heard
about the auction,

920
01:21:52,523 --> 01:21:56,459
I figured it'd be better for me to buy
it than see it pass on to strangers.

921
01:21:56,527 --> 01:21:59,429
Allow me. I know it's a
custom to carry the bride in,

922
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:02,164
But perhaps
we can let that go.

923
01:22:02,232 --> 01:22:05,869
I always figured when I got
married I'd have all the trimmings.

924
01:22:31,762 --> 01:22:37,033
You may notice some changes. There are some
fixings I brought here from kansas city.

925
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,936
Mighty pretty place
you've got here.

926
01:22:40,003 --> 01:22:43,205
Charlie, would you take mrs. Rand's
bags into the front bedroom, please?

927
01:22:43,273 --> 01:22:45,274
I sure will.

928
01:24:30,447 --> 01:24:32,448
Come in.

929
01:24:40,558 --> 01:24:43,059
You're very beautiful.

930
01:24:43,126 --> 01:24:45,862
<i>Thank you.</i>

931
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:48,197
I hope you'll
be comfortable here.

932
01:24:48,265 --> 01:24:52,435
In this house it takes very
little to make me comfortable.

933
01:24:53,837 --> 01:24:56,739
I brought you some wine.

934
01:24:58,876 --> 01:25:02,411
It's customary, I believe,
to drink to a bride's health.

935
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:05,247
You're very gallant.

936
01:25:47,057 --> 01:25:48,992
So you know.

937
01:25:49,059 --> 01:25:51,995
You and I are much alike.

938
01:25:52,062 --> 01:25:55,431
There are times when
I can read your thoughts...

939
01:25:55,499 --> 01:25:58,968
By asking myself what I'd do
if I were in your place.

940
01:25:59,036 --> 01:26:02,404
I know that's an irritating
quality in a husband,

941
01:26:02,472 --> 01:26:04,440
But it may help
to make things easier for you.

942
01:26:06,677 --> 01:26:09,012
Don't come any closer.

943
01:26:09,079 --> 01:26:11,748
You sure
this is all right?

944
01:26:11,815 --> 01:26:14,450
Prentice missed
because the light was bad.

945
01:26:14,518 --> 01:26:16,686
Adam was too anxious.

946
01:26:16,754 --> 01:26:19,421
I'm glad you don't suffer
from those handicaps.

947
01:26:19,489 --> 01:26:21,924
No, I don't.

948
01:26:26,997 --> 01:26:30,299
Do you know
why you missed me?

949
01:26:30,367 --> 01:26:32,802
Because I hate you so,
my hand shook.

950
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:39,275
Your hand shook,
but not because you hate me.

951
01:26:39,342 --> 01:26:41,410
Put the gun down, thor.

952
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:57,259
Oh, jeb. Hold me.

953
01:26:57,327 --> 01:26:59,328
Hold me.

954
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:26,983
<i>Jeb? What is it?
What's the matter?</i>

955
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:31,120
I've gotta leave. There are men
outside. They want to kill me.

956
01:28:31,188 --> 01:28:33,622
It's all
grant callum's doing.

957
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:36,826
I don't know why, but he's wanted
me dead ever since I can remember.

958
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:40,729
Oh, take me with you. I can't, but
we can be together in a little while.

959
01:28:40,798 --> 01:28:43,699
There's an old ruined ranch up
by bear paw butte. Meet me there.

960
01:28:43,767 --> 01:28:47,937
How do I find it? Take the trail through
rimrock canyon, across the county line.

961
01:28:48,005 --> 01:28:50,006
Oh, I'll be there.

962
01:34:09,943 --> 01:34:13,312
Looks like he jumped clean off this
bluff here. Aw, he just outrun us.

963
01:34:13,379 --> 01:34:17,449
Let's give it up. I got a
hunch I know where he is.

964
01:34:17,517 --> 01:34:21,753
Russ, go fetch ma callum
and bring her to bear paw butte.

965
01:34:29,629 --> 01:34:33,665
It's all going to happen again,
but I don't care now.

966
01:34:33,733 --> 01:34:36,468
I know there's one big answer
I've always looked for:

967
01:34:36,536 --> 01:34:40,072
Why I was alone;
why everything went wrong;

968
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:43,075
Why I had hate in me
instead of love.

969
01:34:43,143 --> 01:34:46,611
There was a black dog
riding my back and yours too.

970
01:34:46,679 --> 01:34:49,949
I guess we've lost our chance, but
there's nothing we can do about it now.

971
01:34:50,016 --> 01:34:54,453
Oh, but there is. We've got to
get away from here, both of us.

972
01:35:25,485 --> 01:35:29,204
Jeb rand, we know you're
in there. Come on out!

973
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,718
We'll give you
two minutes!

974
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:50,459
Are you hurt?

975
01:35:54,931 --> 01:35:59,135
I remember now. Those dreams I've
been having ever since I was a kid.

976
01:35:59,202 --> 01:36:01,336
the flashes were gunfire,

977
01:36:01,404 --> 01:36:04,540
And the man shooting
was my father.

978
01:36:04,607 --> 01:36:08,243
My sister lay on the floor dead,
and my brothers were dead too.

979
01:36:08,311 --> 01:36:12,347
The boots and spurs,
they were my father's.

980
01:36:19,622 --> 01:36:21,657
Then he was hit.

981
01:36:21,725 --> 01:36:24,927
I saw him fall.
I knew he'd been killed.

982
01:36:26,997 --> 01:36:30,365
I was too scared to yell,
so I just stayed there.

983
01:36:30,433 --> 01:36:33,669
Then a man came in-
grant callum.

984
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:38,874
He was dragging a woman
with him. She was your mother.

985
01:36:40,577 --> 01:36:43,179
He told her
to look at her rand now.

986
01:36:43,246 --> 01:36:46,882
I remember those words-
"your rand."

987
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:51,187
He asked her if the love she had
for him was worth what she'd done.

988
01:36:51,254 --> 01:36:54,890
Then he threw her down
and dragged my father out.

989
01:36:58,428 --> 01:37:01,063
Jeb, darling,
how horrible.

990
01:37:02,298 --> 01:37:04,767
It must mean
that my mother-

991
01:37:04,835 --> 01:37:07,269
One minute! Come out,
or we'll come and drag you out!

992
01:37:07,337 --> 01:37:09,271
Come on.
I won't.

993
01:37:09,339 --> 01:37:12,274
You're doing this for me because
you're afraid I'll be hurt.

994
01:37:12,342 --> 01:37:14,710
I don't want to live without
you. We've gotta fight.

995
01:37:14,778 --> 01:37:18,146
we're comin' out.
Don't shoot.

996
01:37:18,214 --> 01:37:20,516
Throw your gun out!

997
01:37:25,455 --> 01:37:27,956
Put your hands up.

998
01:37:48,445 --> 01:37:53,282
Oh! Oh, I told him to fight you,
to die fightin' if he had to!

999
01:37:57,487 --> 01:37:59,889
Let me go!

1000
01:38:01,524 --> 01:38:04,443
Oh, mother, you won't
let them do this!

1001
01:38:04,511 --> 01:38:06,978
So, grant, you're gonna
have it your way at last.

1002
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:09,248
I told you I'd wait
until he was grown.

1003
01:38:09,315 --> 01:38:12,884
Well, now he's growed and he gets
his legacy. Only it's made out of him.

1004
01:38:12,952 --> 01:38:16,488
He earned it just as his
father earned the lead he got...

1005
01:38:16,556 --> 01:38:18,990
When he stole
my brother's wife.

1006
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:21,927
Then it was jeb's father!
You loved him.

1007
01:38:21,994 --> 01:38:26,098
Yes, only she forgot she
was married to a callum.

1008
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:28,784
Bring a horse here.
Get me a rope.

1009
01:38:35,208 --> 01:38:37,642
Jeb told me
about the feud.

1010
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:39,945
Now I understand
the part I didn't know.

1011
01:38:40,012 --> 01:38:42,981
It all started because
of your love, your guilt.

1012
01:38:43,049 --> 01:38:45,350
That's why you'd like
to see jeb hanged.

1013
01:38:45,418 --> 01:38:48,887
You don't know what you're
sayin'. This is none of my askin'.

1014
01:38:48,955 --> 01:38:54,025
You never gave jeb a chance. You never told
him the truth so he could protect himself.

1015
01:38:54,094 --> 01:38:57,529
- I was trying to protect you.
- That's a lie.

1016
01:38:57,597 --> 01:39:02,000
- You were ashamed.
- I've paid for what I did.

1017
01:39:02,068 --> 01:39:04,369
I gave the boy a home.
I took him in.

1018
01:39:04,437 --> 01:39:09,741
That paid for all the killin's? For the
way my father died, and jeb's father?

1019
01:39:09,809 --> 01:39:13,145
Well, it didn't!
You loved his father.

1020
01:39:13,213 --> 01:39:15,947
<i>Or are you ashamed now
to remember how you loved?</i>

1021
01:39:16,015 --> 01:39:18,250
No. I loved his father.

1022
01:39:18,318 --> 01:39:22,387
You failed him, mother,
and you failed yourself.

1023
01:39:22,455 --> 01:39:26,091
You lost the man you loved.
He died here.

1024
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:29,628
But my man won't,
unless they kill me too!

1025
01:39:31,531 --> 01:39:33,532
You can't!

1026
01:40:03,863 --> 01:40:08,600
I'm sorry, jeb, for all the wrong I did ya.

1027
01:40:08,668 --> 01:40:12,104
Forgive me. You didn't have to ask me that.

1028
01:40:12,172 --> 01:40:15,440
You've given me back my life. Oh, mother.

1029
01:40:15,508 --> 01:40:19,411
I told you once, jeb,
never to look back.

1030
01:40:19,478 --> 01:40:22,815
Look ahead.
I tell you that again now.

1031
01:40:22,882 --> 01:40:27,652
You couldn't then.
But now I can and will.

1032
01:40:28,654 --> 01:40:31,656
Take your wife
home, jeb.
