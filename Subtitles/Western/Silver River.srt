1
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:02,952
Halt!

2
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:03,912
Major Ross?
Yes?

3
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:05,552
I'm major Wilson
from headquarters.

4
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:07,152
You can't take this wagon
train into the village.

5
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,392
Why not?

6
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:10,112
Lee has engaged our
entire army at Gettysburg.

7
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:12,272
The pay train is not
to enter the village.

8
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,352
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,232
Captain McComb?

10
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:21,432
You're in charge. I'm going
to reconnoiter up ahead.

11
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:22,792
You stay here with
the train. Don't move.

12
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:24,872
Saunders. Bring your men,
come with me.

13
00:02:28,753 --> 00:02:31,713
They left us high and dry
with a wagon load of money.

14
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:33,553
We could start
a little poker game.

15
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,793
Poker? With
an army payroll? Not me.

16
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:43,393
Jeb stuart's right on this flank.
You better get out of here, captain.

17
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:44,193
Look!

18
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:53,113
Get those first two
wagons down the road.

19
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:56,113
We'll make a run for it
with the pay wagon.

20
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:01,874
Pistol, take over the wagon.

21
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:25,675
Captain, what are you
doing with that money?

22
00:04:25,755 --> 00:04:26,715
That's government
property.

23
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:27,755
I know it.

24
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,235
What are you going
to do with it?

25
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:30,195
Burn it.

26
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:31,355
Burn it?

27
00:04:31,435 --> 00:04:33,275
Have you gone crazy?
That stuff's real.

28
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:35,955
Just as real to jeb stuart
if he got a hold of it.

29
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,115
It's getting
a little warm here.

30
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:06,355
Get on that
near wheel horse.

31
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:07,716
I'll pull the kingpin.

32
00:06:11,197 --> 00:06:12,997
Lucky we thought
of burning that money.

33
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:14,557
We won't get anything,

34
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,397
but major Ross will
probably get a promotion.

35
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,877
He can have it.
I'd settle for a good bath.

36
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:22,117
I suppose you have an
explanation for this, captain.

37
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:24,197
Yes, sir. Enemy raiding
party nearly captured us.

38
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:25,637
But we managed
to destroy the payroll.

39
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:28,197
You mean you deliberately
set fire to it?

40
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:29,837
Speak up, captain.

41
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:32,957
Yes, sir. There
it is, or... was.

42
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:35,157
You had your orders
and disobeyed them.

43
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:37,437
Our lines were broken at
Gettysburg, I know that.

44
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:39,837
If the enemy had got
their hands on this money,

45
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:41,557
they could have kept
this war going forever.

46
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:45,277
Captain, we just learned that lee
is in retreat back to virginia.

47
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:47,917
We didn't lose
the battle, we won it.

48
00:06:56,638 --> 00:06:58,798
I left captain McComb
in charge.

49
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:00,678
Told him not to move
from his position.

50
00:07:00,758 --> 00:07:03,198
It seems that he took
matters into his own hands

51
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:05,118
and did, against
army regulations,

52
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:07,958
burn one million dollars of pay
of the union armies in the field.

53
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:11,078
Gentlemen of the court, we
must admit the allegations.

54
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:13,238
We have never denied the
facts as presented here,

55
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:15,798
nor that they were in violation
of the articles of war.

56
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:18,278
But I ask you to
consider the character

57
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:19,678
and record of
this officer.

58
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:22,158
Captain McComb
served under me-

59
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:24,238
therefore I know
whereof I speak.

60
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,158
I realize that
he was under orders,

61
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:28,678
orders not to move
from his position.

62
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:30,358
But gentlemen,
an order is not a god,

63
00:07:30,438 --> 00:07:31,838
it is a guide.

64
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:34,878
This is a flagrant case of
direct and willful disobedience

65
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:36,278
of orders
and regulations.

66
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,798
Captain Michael McComb is to be cashiered
the service of the united states army,

67
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:45,678
forfeiting all pay
and allowances now due.

68
00:07:45,718 --> 00:07:47,919
The findings and sentence
of the court have been approved

69
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,559
and will be duly executed,

70
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,639
by command of
major general howard.

71
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:02,679
Thank you, sergeant.

72
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,319
The war department gantry
opened your case, Mike.

73
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,839
I'm sorry, because I still
don't think you had it coming.

74
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:13,759
Well...

75
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,719
it's a hard, cruel
world, isn't it, major?

76
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:19,879
Well, I really wanted it
to work for ya, Mike.

77
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,159
I even saw
the adjutant general.

78
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:24,679
The adjutant general,
huh? Hmm, thanks.

79
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,959
I can't blame you
for feeling bitter.

80
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,239
Bitter? Ha ha,
I'm not bitter.

81
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,879
I'm grateful...

82
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,959
for the lesson.

83
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:34,919
Lesson?

84
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,479
Yes. I didn't follow their
rules, so they tossed me out.

85
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,160
But I'll follow them
from now on in...

86
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,960
except they're
gonna be my rules.

87
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,000
In other words, if there's
gonna be any shoving around,

88
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,760
next time I'll do it.

89
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,360
Anyway, thanks, major.

90
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,600
Well, good luck, Mike.
Come on, boys.

91
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,000
You lose.

92
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,280
This game is crooked.
I want my money back.

93
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,240
What do you got, only 6s
and aces under those dice?

94
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Can't you make an 11?
Where's honest harry?

95
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,800
I want my money back.
Are you honest harry?

96
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,280
Wait a minute. Now somebody's
gonna get hurt here.

97
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,360
He's my friend. What do
you think you're doing?

98
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,600
We'll show ya.

99
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:43,401
How would you like a nice crack
in the skull with this?

100
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,161
I wouldn't like it.

101
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:49,081
A tulip!

102
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:53,201
Now you better start
kicking up the dirt

103
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:54,641
while you're still
on your feet.

104
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,401
Rough exterior but
a heart of gold.

105
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,161
Yeah. Hard and yellow.

106
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:10,841
Hey, pistol.
Yeah?

107
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,441
Can you still
blow a bugle?

108
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:15,121
A what? A bugle. Can you blow a bugle?

109
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:16,721
I guess I could
if I had a bugle.

110
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:18,041
Go get one.

111
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:26,842
Bugler.

112
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:30,362
Sound assembly.

113
00:10:31,602 --> 00:10:33,362
Can they court-
martial you twice?

114
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:34,602
Blow!

115
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,242
columns in fours, men.

116
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:57,202
Columns in fours.

117
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:02,202
All right, line up,
line up, stretch it out.

118
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:04,242
Attention, left face!

119
00:11:07,122 --> 00:11:09,842
Now then, men,
listen carefully.

120
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:12,682
I have orders I want
carried out immediately.

121
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:14,322
This camp is a disgrace,

122
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:15,762
and there's the cause of it
over there.

123
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,003
Honest harry's. Gambling.

124
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,003
Crooked dice, bad liquor.

125
00:11:20,043 --> 00:11:21,963
You boys didn't lose your money,
you were robbed.

126
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,563
Attention. I'm gonna put
a stop to this.

127
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,123
Go in there and give them
a little of the old army boot.

128
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:30,523
All right, men. Break ranks.

129
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:32,763
Double quick.
Let's go!

130
00:11:41,523 --> 00:11:43,523
You wanna get hurt?

131
00:11:56,643 --> 00:11:58,083
Attention!

132
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:00,603
Well done, men,
I'm proud of you.

133
00:12:00,683 --> 00:12:01,683
Now take these hoodlums

134
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:03,603
and ride them out of town
on a fence rail.

135
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,403
Don't treat 'em too rough...

136
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:08,803
just barely kill 'em.

137
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:10,643
Now where is the tulip?

138
00:12:10,723 --> 00:12:12,004
There he is, over there.

139
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:13,844
He's out cold as a fish.

140
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:16,004
Well, take him and
throw him in the river.

141
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:18,004
This is a new one on me.

142
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:20,724
Stand aside, son. I have
a way with those things.

143
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:21,604
Here.

144
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:24,484
Thank you.

145
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:30,804
All right, boys.

146
00:12:31,804 --> 00:12:33,324
There it is.

147
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:36,604
There's the money those
thieves stole from you.

148
00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:43,444
Hey, don't break up
that gambling equipment.

149
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:47,684
The provost marshall might
need that for evidence.

150
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:49,484
When the provost
gets through with it,

151
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:52,404
we might just buy that in.

152
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:53,804
What are you doing?

153
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:55,804
I'm getting back
my mustering out pay.

154
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:57,284
Well don't use
your pockets.

155
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:59,844
Here. Use a barrel.

156
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:01,484
I'll get yours, too.

157
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:06,245
Pistol?
Yeah?

158
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:09,845
I have news for you.

159
00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:12,725
I think you've just gone
into the gambling business.

160
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:29,125
Mike, we're in trouble.

161
00:13:29,165 --> 00:13:31,205
That bunch of crooked freight
handlers attached our stuff.

162
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:32,485
What for?

163
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,925
Aw, some jacked-up charge
or other, but it's serious.

164
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:37,565
Fellow named Banjo Sweeney
bought the writ of attachment

165
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:38,925
and he's trying
to grab our equipment.

166
00:13:39,005 --> 00:13:40,765
Well, forget it.

167
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:42,325
Cards.
I'm out.

168
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:44,685
Seizing properties on false
attachments is no dodge.

169
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:46,165
It won't work in missouri,

170
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:47,365
but it's sure legal
in kansas.

171
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:49,525
That's right, mister.

172
00:13:49,605 --> 00:13:52,485
I want your bill
of lading, McComb.

173
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:54,885
Oh, we were just
discussing you, mr. Sweeney.

174
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:57,166
Well, there's nothing to
discuss. Just give me the bill.

175
00:13:57,246 --> 00:14:00,366
Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

176
00:14:00,446 --> 00:14:02,526
After all, if you're going
to grab a man's equipment,

177
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:05,646
i think the least you could do is give
him the benefit of a little conversation.

178
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:08,206
I didn't come here for
conversation. Quit stalling.

179
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:09,486
I'm not stalling.

180
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:11,446
Why don't you sit down
and have a drink?

181
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:12,566
We can settle.

182
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:14,966
I'll get the sheriff.
He'll settle your hash.

183
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:17,246
Take one more step,
and I'll shoot you...

184
00:14:17,326 --> 00:14:18,606
in the back.

185
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:27,246
You don't take
any chances, do you?

186
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:29,766
I never take chances.
It's too risky.

187
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:31,086
Hey! Hey, mr. Sweeney.

188
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,966
I've been looking
all over for ya.

189
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:33,886
Serve the writ.

190
00:14:33,926 --> 00:14:35,046
Huh? Oh, yeah.

191
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:37,086
That's McComb right there...

192
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,046
with the gun.

193
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:38,926
Yeah...

194
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:41,246
yeah...

195
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:43,846
well...

196
00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:50,327
what's the matter, boys?

197
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:53,487
Couldn't be that we crossed the
line into missouri, could it?

198
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:56,927
That's right. I'm sorry, mr. Sweeney.

199
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:04,607
You know, McComb, the way you
held that gun on him, i...

200
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:05,927
i really thought you'd
shoot him in the back.

201
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:09,127
Hey, pistol.
Take care of the purser.

202
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:11,567
See our stuff
gets off first, huh?

203
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:14,847
Um, your bet,
i believe, mr. Blakely.

204
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:27,807
Drink, soldier?

205
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:29,847
Here's what we collected
on deck for the boys.

206
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:32,207
Looks like they kept their
hands in their pockets.

207
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:34,447
Didn't dare disturb
the cabin passengers.

208
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:36,127
They're mostly yankees.

209
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,367
Give me that.
I just love to see

210
00:15:38,407 --> 00:15:40,167
yankees and their money
part company.

211
00:15:42,327 --> 00:15:46,008
I've never seen a handsome
gentleman who wasn't generous.

212
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,328
Thank you.

213
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:50,328
Purser?
Yes, sir?

214
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:51,808
When we get to st. Joe,

215
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:54,008
would you see that McComb's
stuff gets off first?

216
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:05,648
I'll raise you 200.

217
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:07,568
I've had enough.

218
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:08,808
Oh, miss Moore.

219
00:16:08,888 --> 00:16:10,448
Don't get up,
mr. Chevigee.

220
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:12,328
I'm just collecting money
for the soldiers on deck.

221
00:16:12,368 --> 00:16:13,728
Would you mind?

222
00:16:13,768 --> 00:16:14,688
It's a pleasure, ma'am.

223
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:16,768
Thank you.

224
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:17,568
Of course,
of course.

225
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:20,368
Go away.

226
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:21,888
Go away before I shoot you.

227
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:23,048
In the back.

228
00:16:24,888 --> 00:16:26,008
I'll call ya.

229
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:29,688
I happen to be trying
to help wounded soldiers.

230
00:16:29,728 --> 00:16:31,328
Now would you
care to contribute?

231
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:35,728
Your pardon, ma'am.

232
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:40,329
I had no notion
i was addressing a lady.

233
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:41,969
Thank you.

234
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:42,929
Wait a minute.

235
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:46,369
The change.

236
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:47,489
Thank you.

237
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:50,569
Who's that?

238
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:51,769
That's Georgia Moore.

239
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:54,049
She and her husband own
the silver river mines.

240
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:55,529
Nice people.

241
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:56,929
Very nice.

242
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:59,449
And you're very generous,
too, with my money.

243
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:01,209
I'd make that pot
good if I were you.

244
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:03,209
Three aces.

245
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:07,249
I had no idea the frontier
could boast such charming ladies.

246
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,729
And speaking of
charming ladies.

247
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,490
What is this?

248
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,410
Our stuff was supposed
to come off first.

249
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,770
Did you pay off
the purser?

250
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,730
He wouldn't take anything.
He was a northerner, too.

251
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,170
You can't trust anybody.

252
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,530
Where's the fellow
who owns those wagons?

253
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,570
He's over here.

254
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,570
Well, you keep
an eye on the stuff.

255
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,490
Hustle up. Murphy,
pull up that team.

256
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,810
Say, these wagons yours?

257
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,930
Yep. Sam slade,
that's me.

258
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,210
Like to hire
some of them.

259
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,210
Sorry, mister, can't be done. Why not?

260
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,690
You're too late.
The lady's got 'em.

261
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,210
Set those crates down easy!

262
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,290
I didn't bring
that machinery

263
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,810
all the way out here
for you to ruin it.

264
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,290
All right,
take the cable off.

265
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,370
Wagon boss is a bit tough.
See what you can do with him.

266
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,450
We're liable to run
into rough weather.

267
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,851
Hello, mrs. Moore.

268
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:28,091
Or maybe you're mrs.
Moore's younger brother.

269
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:30,291
That's very funny.
What do you want?

270
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:32,571
I want a little help. You
remember me, don't you?

271
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,491
I'm the man who so graciously
contributed to your worthy cause.

272
00:18:35,571 --> 00:18:37,091
I'd like to get
a couple of your wagons.

273
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:38,131
That's impossible.

274
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:39,411
Oh, just a minute.

275
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:41,531
This is business. I need
those wagons pretty bad.

276
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:43,331
Like to make you
an offer.

277
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:46,971
Sorry, the answer is no,
Mr. Whatever-your-name-is.

278
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:49,411
Mccomb, ma'am.
Mike McComb.

279
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:51,291
I need all I have
and more.

280
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:53,931
I've been trying to get this mining
machinery to silver city for six months.

281
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:55,931
Sorry.
Oh, that's all right.

282
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:57,891
I just thought
out west here

283
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,251
everybody tried giving the
other fellow a helping hand.

284
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,371
We also have a saying-
what's mine is mine.

285
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:05,291
I keep the wagons.

286
00:19:06,491 --> 00:19:08,411
Pretty smart in those pants.

287
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,331
I'd look pretty
silly without 'em.

288
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:12,371
But a couple of drinks
ain't gonna hurt ya.

289
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:15,132
Sorry, son, I gotta
stick on the job.

290
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:17,292
I'll tell you what i
will do, though. What?

291
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:20,732
If you stick around, I might play
you a little game of horseshoes.

292
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:26,852
Give them horses
a smackin' big feed.

293
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,972
We're leaving the first
thing in the morning.

294
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:30,372
Whose stuff are
you hauling, sam?

295
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:32,452
Belongs to the Moore
company. Silver river.

296
00:19:32,492 --> 00:19:33,732
What do you charge
a trip?

297
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,452
Plenty. But I ain't
got room this trip

298
00:19:35,532 --> 00:19:37,572
to carry a humpbacked mouse.

299
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:40,092
He's got ethics. I offered
him twice the price

300
00:19:40,172 --> 00:19:42,572
to carry our stuff instead.
But he's got ethics.

301
00:19:42,652 --> 00:19:44,612
Well, I like a man
with ethics.

302
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:46,092
You sure got a way
with those horseshoes.

303
00:19:46,132 --> 00:19:48,452
That was $10 a game.
I know it.

304
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:49,692
Fifth game you won
in a row, isn't it?

305
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,332
I'm good at all kinds
of games. That's my nature.

306
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:54,692
Hey. You ever
play poker?

307
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:58,852
Poker? I said
all kinds of games.

308
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:01,612
"And I do, therefore,
transfer to said Mike McComb

309
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:03,532
"all my wagons and
freighting equipment

310
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:07,572
in payment of the said
sporting obligation."

311
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:09,373
I think that'll do it.

312
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:12,413
Put your John hancock
here, sam.

313
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:14,653
I shoulda stuck
to horseshoes.

314
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,173
Well, so long,
mister.

315
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:18,773
No. Wait a minute, sam. You're
still my wagon boss, aren't you?

316
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,253
Yeah.

317
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,573
Well, how about getting that
Moore stuff off my wagons, huh?

318
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:30,213
Mike, how can you do that?

319
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:31,853
Do what?

320
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,293
Take those wagons away
from mrs. Moore?

321
00:20:34,373 --> 00:20:35,733
She needs 'em.

322
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:37,013
Pistol...

323
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:38,573
allow me to
explain something

324
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:41,053
that may be a guide
to you in the future.

325
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,613
From now on, I am
interested only

326
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:46,533
in the needs of one
Michael j. Mccomb.

327
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,613
Have it your own way.

328
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:50,133
I will.

329
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:52,053
She's got an awful temper.

330
00:20:52,093 --> 00:20:54,893
I wouldn't want
to tangle with her.

331
00:20:54,973 --> 00:20:57,533
That's where you and i
are different, pal.

332
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:13,254
Hey, what are you doing loading
McComb's freight on my wagons?

333
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:14,854
These are our wagons
now, lady.

334
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:15,894
Where's slade?

335
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:17,494
He's over there
on the dock.

336
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,734
Get in your wagons.

337
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,174
Have you gone crazy,
sam slade?

338
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:25,654
Maybe, yeah.
I ain't sure yet.

339
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:27,214
Why are you doing all this?

340
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:29,094
Well, if it's all the same
to you, mrs. Moore,

341
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:31,414
i held a bad hand
last night.

342
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:33,814
I'm doing what the new owner
of this wagon outfit ordered.

343
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:34,974
What new owner?

344
00:21:35,014 --> 00:21:36,294
You're lookin'
right at him.

345
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:37,854
All right, sam,
get 'em rolling.

346
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:39,054
Can I be of
any service, ma'am?

347
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:41,414
You cheap, double-crossing
tinhorn gambler.

348
00:21:41,454 --> 00:21:43,254
I'll have you strung up
for stealing my outfit.

349
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:45,454
Why now, mrs. Moore,
don't scare me like that.

350
00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:47,414
If you want to do business
with me, talk nice and sweet.

351
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:50,574
But I've got to get this machinery to
silver city. My husband's expecting it.

352
00:21:50,614 --> 00:21:52,454
Then I'll be very glad
to do your husband a favor

353
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:53,815
and bring his little
wife home to him.

354
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,855
With the machinery?

355
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:56,775
With love and kisses,
but no machinery.

356
00:21:56,855 --> 00:21:59,135
I've got no room. You
want a ride or don't ya?

357
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:00,335
No, thank you.

358
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:02,735
Maybe you're not so
anxious to get home, huh?

359
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:04,935
Not if I have
to go with you.

360
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:07,215
Now that kind of flattery will
get you nowhere, mrs. Moore.

361
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:09,215
Well, if you're not
going to ride with me,

362
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:11,135
there's a stagecoach
leaving in about a week.

363
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:12,295
Adios.

364
00:23:00,536 --> 00:23:04,256
We're about to pass
your wagons, mrs. Moore.

365
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:07,696
We'll be in silver city first.

366
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:10,576
Might even organize a little
reception committee.

367
00:23:10,616 --> 00:23:12,936
I have no further
interest in mr. Mccomb.

368
00:23:38,096 --> 00:23:41,297
Mr. Mccomb. Certainly
glad to see you again.

369
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,617
We're having a
little trouble here.

370
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:44,017
So I see.

371
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:46,097
I know you've
got quite a load,

372
00:23:46,177 --> 00:23:48,017
but if you could take
us into silver city,

373
00:23:48,097 --> 00:23:50,337
I'd consider it
a great favor.

374
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:52,417
Why, mrs. Moore.

375
00:23:52,457 --> 00:23:54,817
Having
a pleasant journey?

376
00:23:54,897 --> 00:23:57,017
Can you take us?
You bet.

377
00:23:57,057 --> 00:23:58,777
How much is this
gonna cost us, McComb?

378
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:00,857
Aw, mr. Sweeney, it's not
gonna cost you a nickel.

379
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,657
You're staying right here.

380
00:24:02,777 --> 00:24:05,937
Then he's going to have
company. I'm not going.

381
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,737
You can't do this,
mrs. Moore.

382
00:24:07,817 --> 00:24:10,097
Why, it'll be two days before
they get a new wheel out here.

383
00:24:10,137 --> 00:24:11,777
I'd sooner ride
with the devil.

384
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:13,617
He ain't with
us this trip.

385
00:24:13,697 --> 00:24:15,737
Oh, do come, mrs. Moore.
I insist.

386
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:18,057
Oh, come on, mrs. Moore.

387
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:25,537
I'll catch up to you
in silver city.

388
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:54,458
We're camping here
tonight, mrs. Moore.

389
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,738
Make my wagon
your home, won't you?

390
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:05,098
Certainly nice
country, charlie.

391
00:25:05,178 --> 00:25:07,058
Yes, and plenty of 'er.

392
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:08,378
Any indians around here?

393
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,218
Shucks, no, and not within
a hundred mile of here.

394
00:25:21,498 --> 00:25:23,938
I like you better in skirts.

395
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:27,179
Sorry to disappoint
you, McComb.

396
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,219
Where ya going?

397
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:30,779
To make my bed
and get some sleep,

398
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:32,739
if it's all right with you.

399
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:35,419
Sure it's all right,
but I had an uncle once,

400
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:37,299
slept away from
the wagons one night.

401
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:38,739
In the morning he woke
up without his hair.

402
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:41,179
Scalped.

403
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:43,899
Now how would you know whether
or not there are indians out here?

404
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:46,499
You've never been west
before, greenhorn.

405
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:00,779
Ain't you gonna
sleep in the wagon?

406
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,379
No, you take it tonight.
I'll bunk down here.

407
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:05,059
I'll go over and count
the horses again

408
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:07,419
and pick up a couple
of blankets.

409
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,460
Please, mrs. Moore.

410
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,900
You could at least
knock on the wheel.

411
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,460
What sort of
a man is your husband?

412
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,340
He's a gentleman.

413
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,020
Oh... isn't that a shame.

414
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,700
How long since
you've seen him?

415
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,220
You ask a lot of
questions, don't you?

416
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:14,181
You're the sort of woman
a man asks questions about.

417
00:27:14,261 --> 00:27:17,181
Besides,
i like your answers.

418
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,021
I thought you made up
all your own answers.

419
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:26,381
Awful wet down here.

420
00:27:28,101 --> 00:27:29,221
Good.

421
00:27:45,341 --> 00:27:46,741
Oh, I'm so sorry,
mrs. Moore.

422
00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:49,061
It was only pistol. He
didn't know you were there.

423
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:51,861
I'm sorry, mister.

424
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:53,061
Are you hurt?

425
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:55,341
No, it's just
bent a little.

426
00:27:57,901 --> 00:28:01,581
Pistol, take these over to
mrs. Moore with my compliments.

427
00:28:01,621 --> 00:28:03,021
She's gone.

428
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,462
Gone?

429
00:28:04,502 --> 00:28:05,942
How far can she get?

430
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:08,182
As far as your horse
will take her.

431
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:25,462
Take 'em on down to
the wagon yard, sam.

432
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:31,702
You ain't aimin' to settle in
silver city, are ya, stranger?

433
00:28:31,782 --> 00:28:33,782
Oh, I might. Why?

434
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:35,662
Well, if I was you,
I'd keep moving.

435
00:28:35,742 --> 00:28:37,262
Any particular reason?

436
00:28:37,302 --> 00:28:38,742
You wouldn't
like it here.

437
00:28:38,822 --> 00:28:40,502
Bad for your health.

438
00:28:40,582 --> 00:28:43,382
Oh, well, that's certainly
very kind of you boys

439
00:28:43,462 --> 00:28:46,582
to be so considerate
over a stranger.

440
00:28:46,622 --> 00:28:48,742
Here. Hold my horse, sonny.

441
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:14,863
All right, boys.
Out you go.

442
00:29:14,943 --> 00:29:16,023
We were just-

443
00:29:16,103 --> 00:29:17,943
you're too young for
this game. Come on, kid.

444
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,583
Come back when you're
old enough to shave.

445
00:29:35,143 --> 00:29:36,463
Move over.

446
00:29:40,423 --> 00:29:43,463
Hello, McComb.
Open for business?

447
00:29:43,543 --> 00:29:44,743
What kind?

448
00:29:44,823 --> 00:29:47,623
Strictly on the level.
Maybe you remember.

449
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,984
I was figuring on a layout
like this for myself.

450
00:29:51,064 --> 00:29:53,344
Too bad your equipment
didn't get here.

451
00:29:53,384 --> 00:29:54,784
I was coming to that.

452
00:29:54,864 --> 00:29:57,224
Mccomb, you need a partner.

453
00:29:57,304 --> 00:29:59,544
I do?
Who do you suggest?

454
00:29:59,624 --> 00:30:01,464
You're looking right at him.

455
00:30:01,544 --> 00:30:03,104
What do you say?

456
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:06,944
I'd say you'd better have
a drink and forget it.

457
00:30:07,024 --> 00:30:08,584
I don't need any partners.

458
00:30:11,264 --> 00:30:13,344
Is there an undertaker
in this town?

459
00:30:13,424 --> 00:30:14,384
Yeah.

460
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,304
Your boys seem
to be a bit rough.

461
00:30:18,344 --> 00:30:20,584
You wouldn't want them
to get hurt, would ya?

462
00:30:20,624 --> 00:30:23,904
Nobody's gonna get hurt. They're
just celebrating our partnership.

463
00:30:23,944 --> 00:30:26,984
Banjo, I seem to remember
telling you once before

464
00:30:27,064 --> 00:30:30,904
i never take chances.
It's too risky.

465
00:30:38,384 --> 00:30:41,144
But maybe I do
need a partner.

466
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:43,585
A silent partner.

467
00:30:54,345 --> 00:30:56,465
When he comes to, tell
him he's out of business.

468
00:30:56,545 --> 00:30:58,145
Now get him out of here.

469
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:10,785
A glass of milk.

470
00:31:10,865 --> 00:31:12,625
Primitive, but persuasive.

471
00:31:12,665 --> 00:31:13,665
What?

472
00:31:13,745 --> 00:31:16,385
Your method of
settling a debate.

473
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:18,745
What are you selling?
You sound like a lawyer.

474
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:21,865
I am a lawyer. Business
is a little slow at the moment.

475
00:31:21,945 --> 00:31:24,425
It might surprise you,
sir, to know that

476
00:31:24,505 --> 00:31:26,425
one of our great
universities of learning

477
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:28,745
once pronounced me
its potential best.

478
00:31:28,825 --> 00:31:32,225
I am still potential.

479
00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:33,905
Well, how about
a potential drink?

480
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:35,105
Always.

481
00:31:38,386 --> 00:31:40,266
That's a gentleman's drink.

482
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:44,106
Beck is my name, sir.
John Plato Beck.

483
00:31:44,146 --> 00:31:46,546
Thank you. Mccomb.

484
00:31:46,586 --> 00:31:47,906
Michael j. Mccomb.

485
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:48,906
To your health, sir.

486
00:31:48,946 --> 00:31:50,026
Thank you, sir.

487
00:31:51,226 --> 00:31:52,746
Someone else here
to see you, Mike.

488
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,306
Who is it?

489
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,586
I think you better make yourself
scarce. This is personal.

490
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:57,946
The lady's husband.

491
00:32:05,346 --> 00:32:06,626
You're McComb?

492
00:32:06,706 --> 00:32:08,146
That's right.

493
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:12,146
I'm stanley Moore
of the silver river mine.

494
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,626
What can I do for you?

495
00:32:14,706 --> 00:32:17,546
My wife tells me you took
over our freight wagons.

496
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:20,106
Those wagons were
neither hers nor yours.

497
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,266
I bought them faithfully.
Did she tell you that?

498
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:24,426
Yes, she did.

499
00:32:24,466 --> 00:32:25,546
Can I offer you a drink?

500
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:28,266
Mccomb, I'm in kind of a spot.

501
00:32:28,306 --> 00:32:30,027
To get my machinery
i need those wagons.

502
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:31,907
Will you lend them to me?

503
00:32:31,987 --> 00:32:34,067
Lend them to you?

504
00:32:34,147 --> 00:32:37,547
Mr. Moore, I operate
strictly on a cash basis.

505
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:40,187
If you want to buy those
wagons, they're for sale.

506
00:32:40,227 --> 00:32:41,627
How much do you want?

507
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:42,947
Oh...

508
00:32:45,027 --> 00:32:45,987
$6,000.

509
00:32:47,147 --> 00:32:49,907
I haven't that kind
of money on hand.

510
00:32:49,947 --> 00:32:53,907
Will you take shares in the silver
river mine? A dollar a share.

511
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:59,907
What do you say,
your honor?

512
00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:01,707
That stock
worth anything?

513
00:33:01,827 --> 00:33:03,467
Might be. It's a gamble.

514
00:33:03,587 --> 00:33:05,827
Well, I'm
a gambling man.

515
00:33:05,907 --> 00:33:07,547
I think you've got
a deal, mr. Moore.

516
00:33:07,587 --> 00:33:10,747
Oh, have you met
my lawyer, mr. Beck?

517
00:33:10,787 --> 00:33:11,947
We've met.

518
00:33:12,027 --> 00:33:13,907
I have a client?

519
00:33:13,947 --> 00:33:15,867
It looks like it.
Have you got an office?

520
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:17,587
Just down the street, sir.

521
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:19,507
My hat.

522
00:33:19,587 --> 00:33:20,507
Let's go.

523
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:21,387
All right.

524
00:33:24,908 --> 00:33:26,468
Get rid of this.

525
00:33:27,948 --> 00:33:31,228
If you'll just sign one of
these blank forms, mr. Mccomb,

526
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:32,908
I'll make out the bill
of sale for the wagons

527
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:35,828
and give it to mr. Moore
in the morning.

528
00:33:35,908 --> 00:33:37,708
All right.

529
00:33:37,788 --> 00:33:39,068
Here we are.

530
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:43,068
Very pretty.

531
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:45,788
I hope our little deal
works out profitably for you.

532
00:33:45,828 --> 00:33:47,548
I hope so, mr. Moore.

533
00:33:47,628 --> 00:33:49,148
Now, if you'll pardon me.

534
00:33:51,668 --> 00:33:53,908
Give my regards to
mrs. Moore, won't you?

535
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:56,148
Yes, of course.

536
00:33:56,228 --> 00:33:59,588
Interesting couple,
the Moores.

537
00:33:59,628 --> 00:34:00,748
Hmm.

538
00:34:00,828 --> 00:34:02,588
Good looking wife.

539
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,868
He's to be envied.

540
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:11,708
You sound like
a lonely man, mr. Mccomb.

541
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:17,029
Man is only lonely when he
depends on other people, mr. Beck.

542
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:18,629
I don't.

543
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:22,309
As a student of human nature,
you excite my curiosity.

544
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:27,069
Where'd you come from and
what are you looking for?

545
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:30,669
I'm looking for a lawyer who
can mind his own business.

546
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:31,669
Sorry.

547
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:37,589
Gibbons' decline and fall.

548
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:40,989
I seem to remember a quotation
from that. Let me see...

549
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:42,909
"no clash of arms,
no matter of rebellion

550
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:45,309
can pluck from his grasp
what he had won."

551
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,869
Sounds as if
you knew it.

552
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,669
Oh, I read a book once.

553
00:34:48,749 --> 00:34:49,669
Heh heh.

554
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,589
Well, caesar was ambitious.

555
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:55,989
He lived by it, and
he died because of it.

556
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:58,789
A bad exchange, that,
isn't it, mr. Beck?

557
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:00,789
Death for ambition.

558
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:02,949
But, of course, there's
an answer for that, too.

559
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:04,909
Ambition should be
made of sterner stuff.

560
00:35:04,989 --> 00:35:06,949
Of course, you've
got to be lucky.

561
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:08,990
Even caesar couldn't
make his own luck.

562
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,950
Oh, caesar didn't
have bad luck.

563
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,390
That was bad judgment.
He trusted a friend.

564
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,430
Remember? Brutus.

565
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,510
Good night.

566
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,350
You shouldn't have
waited up, darling.

567
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,750
I couldn't sleep.

568
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,670
He didn't give you the wagons.

569
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,230
I knew it would be like that.

570
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,950
You've got him all wrong,
Georgia. We made a deal.

571
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,150
What kind of a deal?

572
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,270
A fair one.

573
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,390
He doesn't even know
the meaning of the word.

574
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,270
I think you're
being hard on him.

575
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,830
He's just a businessman.

576
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,271
Stanley, you're not in
boston. You're in silver city.

577
00:36:01,311 --> 00:36:04,791
The only dealing McComb
knows is double dealing.

578
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,671
What did you give him
for the wagons?

579
00:36:06,711 --> 00:36:07,631
It wasn't money.

580
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:08,591
Well, what then?

581
00:36:10,311 --> 00:36:11,911
Some shares in the mine.

582
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:14,551
Oh, I know he's
a little smooth,

583
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,391
but he's plenty smart, too.

584
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:18,991
Stanley, how many shares
did you give him?

585
00:36:19,071 --> 00:36:20,391
6,000.

586
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,991
Don't worry, it'll be all
right, darling. You'll see.

587
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:38,071
Do you remember me?

588
00:36:38,151 --> 00:36:41,631
You bet I do.
Sam. How are you?

589
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:43,391
Still pitching horseshoes? Some.

590
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:46,031
But I ain't playin' poker.

591
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,511
Had a tough run of luck,
mr. Mccomb.

592
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:50,711
Taking a party upcountry.
But the trouble is-

593
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,431
i know. You need
a stake, huh?

594
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:54,992
Uh-huh. I thought
that maybe- pistol.

595
00:36:55,072 --> 00:36:57,832
I guess we sort of owe
you a favor anyway, sam.

596
00:36:57,912 --> 00:37:00,072
Take care of him,
will ya? Good luck.

597
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:03,152
This is getting
monotonous, Plato.

598
00:37:03,192 --> 00:37:04,672
More and more of
this paper every night.

599
00:37:04,752 --> 00:37:06,032
That's true enough.

600
00:37:10,192 --> 00:37:12,712
Tell the dealers not to
accept any more of this stuff.

601
00:37:12,712 --> 00:37:15,032
After tonight I want gambling
losses paid off in cash.

602
00:37:15,112 --> 00:37:16,832
Wait. Local merchants
are accepting these vouchers.

603
00:37:16,912 --> 00:37:18,032
Well, I'm not.

604
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:20,392
Aren't the mine owners going
to redeem these things?

605
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:21,432
They'd like to.

606
00:37:21,512 --> 00:37:22,832
What do you mean,
"they'd like to"?

607
00:37:22,912 --> 00:37:24,712
I've gone over the whole
problem with the mine owners

608
00:37:24,752 --> 00:37:26,112
and, believe me,
it is a problem.

609
00:37:26,152 --> 00:37:27,752
They're forced to
issue these vouchers

610
00:37:27,832 --> 00:37:30,912
because you and your gaming table have
corralled all the money in the town.

611
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:32,672
Then let them get
some more money.

612
00:37:32,712 --> 00:37:35,072
Haven't they heard there's a little
thing called a mint in san francisco?

613
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,432
You know, if there was a local bank,
these vouchers could be redeemed.

614
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:39,472
I think I'll take a little
ride in the morning

615
00:37:39,512 --> 00:37:41,392
and find out what goes on
in this mining business.

616
00:37:52,073 --> 00:37:53,433
Good morning.

617
00:37:53,513 --> 00:37:55,113
I just thought I'd come
up and take a look around.

618
00:37:55,193 --> 00:37:56,153
You're poaching.

619
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:57,513
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

620
00:37:57,553 --> 00:37:59,593
I'm a stockholder,
remember?

621
00:37:59,673 --> 00:38:02,393
I remember a lot
of things about you.

622
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:03,393
Good.

623
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:06,713
One is that I don't like ya.

624
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:07,633
Going somewhere?

625
00:38:09,273 --> 00:38:11,153
Think I'll come
along with ya.

626
00:38:11,193 --> 00:38:13,233
What do you think
you're doing?

627
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:14,953
Aw, I'd like
to talk business.

628
00:38:23,753 --> 00:38:26,953
Everything going smoothly
at our mine, I hope.

629
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:30,433
Take it up with my husband.
I'm going to see him now.

630
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:32,993
Oh, in that case,
we'll take our time.

631
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,873
Why don't you
leave us alone?

632
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:40,914
Because I've met
your husband.

633
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:43,594
Just what are you
trying to say?

634
00:38:45,354 --> 00:38:49,554
Just that I don't think you dislike
me as much as you think you do.

635
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:52,354
I think you're
just scared.

636
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:53,794
You're a fool, McComb.

637
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,594
You've got the wrong woman.

638
00:39:07,194 --> 00:39:08,754
Glad to see you, McComb.

639
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:10,994
Thanks. You make me feel
like one of the family.

640
00:39:11,034 --> 00:39:12,674
I guess you're up here
about the stock.

641
00:39:12,754 --> 00:39:14,034
Yeah. I'm not getting
any returns.

642
00:39:14,074 --> 00:39:16,794
Well, you might as well know.

643
00:39:16,874 --> 00:39:18,274
You won't get any.

644
00:39:18,354 --> 00:39:19,714
With that smelter
going up?

645
00:39:19,794 --> 00:39:22,474
I can't finish putting it up.
I'm about cleaned out.

646
00:39:22,514 --> 00:39:24,514
I'm sorry
to hear that, Moore.

647
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:27,354
Something about a losing
investment I don't like.

648
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:29,234
You never take a chance,
do you, McComb?

649
00:39:29,314 --> 00:39:31,034
Not if I can help it.

650
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:32,674
I know a lot of people
who don't know

651
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:34,395
what to do with a chance
when they get it.

652
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:36,995
I've got some more above
ground, but no credit.

653
00:39:37,035 --> 00:39:39,395
If I have to,
i might be able to sell out

654
00:39:39,435 --> 00:39:40,875
to a syndicate
in san francisco.

655
00:39:40,955 --> 00:39:43,555
Too bad to take
such a loss.

656
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:46,555
Why take it?

657
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:49,435
That's right, stanley.
Mccomb has plenty of money.

658
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:51,355
If we get
our smelter up now,

659
00:39:51,435 --> 00:39:53,315
the other mine owners
have to come to us.

660
00:39:53,395 --> 00:39:55,315
Why not let him advance
what we need?

661
00:39:56,515 --> 00:39:58,115
That sounds like
a very good idea.

662
00:39:58,155 --> 00:39:59,955
I might even
consider it for a...

663
00:40:00,035 --> 00:40:02,395
shall we say...

664
00:40:02,475 --> 00:40:05,795
a third interest in
silver river properties?

665
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:08,155
You don't
ask for much.

666
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:11,955
I don't know.
The way things stand, i...

667
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,395
i think maybe we'd better
accept McComb's offer.

668
00:40:14,435 --> 00:40:17,195
Good. Then we'll
all be partners.

669
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,236
Why don't you
fellows get smart?

670
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,636
The mine owners will
never pay off in money

671
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:45,436
as long as you keep
taking their paper.

672
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,476
So don't let them
feed you that malarkey

673
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:48,956
about the cash
coming later.

674
00:40:49,036 --> 00:40:51,276
They'll keep you working for
nothing. It's in the greed.

675
00:40:51,356 --> 00:40:53,116
And let me tell you
another thing.

676
00:40:53,196 --> 00:40:54,676
Mike McComb's in with 'em.

677
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:56,316
That don't sound
right, banjo.

678
00:40:56,396 --> 00:40:57,556
Mike's a gambler.

679
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:06,556
Hey, McComb!

680
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:11,396
What's banjo sweeney selling?
Patent medicine?

681
00:41:11,476 --> 00:41:12,836
Looks like trouble,
Mike.

682
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:14,716
Bar that door.

683
00:41:14,756 --> 00:41:16,076
That one, too.

684
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:18,436
The mine owners are
upstairs waiting for you.

685
00:41:24,477 --> 00:41:27,677
Well. Silver city's most
distinguished citizens.

686
00:41:27,757 --> 00:41:29,197
And mrs. Moore.

687
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,597
I had no idea there were
to be ladies present.

688
00:41:31,637 --> 00:41:33,997
I'm here as a mine owner,
mr. Mccomb.

689
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:36,677
We're not paying a social call.
We're having trouble with the mines.

690
00:41:36,717 --> 00:41:37,957
Ah, trouble,
trouble, trouble.

691
00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:40,557
Indeed, we all have our
troubles, do we not?

692
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:42,197
You're the cause
of our troubles.

693
00:41:42,277 --> 00:41:44,197
You won't let the miners
gamble unless they have cash.

694
00:41:44,277 --> 00:41:45,917
You know we've been
paying them off in paper.

695
00:41:45,957 --> 00:41:48,117
Then pay them off
in cash. Suit me better.

696
00:41:48,197 --> 00:41:50,277
Well, the truth is, there's
no loose money around.

697
00:41:50,357 --> 00:41:53,277
Now these gentlemen and
this lady here thought maybe-

698
00:41:53,317 --> 00:41:55,517
maybe they'd better do less
thinking and more mining.

699
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,277
Anyway,
why come to me?

700
00:41:57,317 --> 00:41:58,957
Don't be a bunch
of sheep!

701
00:41:58,997 --> 00:42:00,597
Go in there and
make them pay up!

702
00:42:06,277 --> 00:42:10,397
I think I may have
a possible solution.

703
00:42:10,477 --> 00:42:12,318
Some of you aren't
going to like it,

704
00:42:12,398 --> 00:42:14,638
but it's going to be
my way or not at all.

705
00:42:14,718 --> 00:42:16,158
I'll set up a bank.

706
00:42:16,198 --> 00:42:18,158
How's that
for an idea, Plato?

707
00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:20,238
He's right, gentlemen.

708
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:23,358
He has all the cash and he could
guarantee the weekly payroll.

709
00:42:23,398 --> 00:42:25,238
This is going to
cost us something.

710
00:42:25,278 --> 00:42:26,558
What is it, McComb?

711
00:42:26,638 --> 00:42:30,078
Mrs. Moore, it's
a hard, cruel world.

712
00:42:30,158 --> 00:42:32,278
Naturally it's going
to cost you something.

713
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:35,158
I want a cut of stock from
every mine in silver city.

714
00:42:35,238 --> 00:42:36,198
That's robbery!

715
00:42:36,278 --> 00:42:37,478
No, no, no.
That's business.

716
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:40,278
Of course, there'd be
an additional fee. Say 10%-

717
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:42,478
also payable in stock.

718
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,598
Plato, I'm proud of you. Sometimes
i think you earn your salary.

719
00:42:45,678 --> 00:42:47,678
Well, I suppose there's
nothing else we can do.

720
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:49,798
You win, McComb.

721
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:52,158
You're in the banking
business.

722
00:42:52,198 --> 00:42:54,358
I'll go welcome
my new depositors.

723
00:43:01,758 --> 00:43:04,118
All right, all right,
cool off, boys.

724
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,959
I've just been
having a little talk

725
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:09,479
with the mine owners
inside here

726
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:10,239
and they seem to think

727
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:11,799
it would be a good idea
if I were to set up a bank.

728
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:18,879
All right.
I'll guarantee my bank

729
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:21,079
will meet all
the paper you hold

730
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:23,079
and pay you off in cash.
How is that?

731
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,519
How are you boys doing
with those doors down there?

732
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:33,039
Knock 'em down and come on in
for a drink on the bank.

733
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,560
Put those bags on the table

734
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,360
then go back to the palace
and get the rest of the stuff.

735
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,840
What do you think of it?

736
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,840
I like 'em better
with two sleeves.

737
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,720
Oh. Meet my new tailor,
mister...

738
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,000
anyway, he once made a suit
for the prince of wales.

739
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,480
Mike, with the money
you're making,

740
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,360
you can afford to
get them ready made.

741
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,240
Make him a new vest.

742
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,240
Plato says
I'm now a gentleman.

743
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,000
Going on the theory that
clothes make the man.

744
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,680
No offense, Mike.

745
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,760
Not bad.

746
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,880
Mr. Mccomb, if you please. Oh, sorry.

747
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,000
I don't understand it. First you
loan the money here at the bank,

748
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,160
then you win it back at the
gambling tables across the street,

749
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,480
put it back in the bank,
then loan it out again.

750
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,801
But are we making
anything?

751
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:52,881
That's high finance,
pistol. Explain it to him.

752
00:44:52,961 --> 00:44:55,561
He might not be so wrong.
This system could backfire.

753
00:44:55,641 --> 00:44:56,761
Better think about it.

754
00:44:56,841 --> 00:44:58,641
Don't you think I've
thought about it already?

755
00:44:58,721 --> 00:45:01,361
We're not stopping
here. We're expanding.

756
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:03,521
Carson city,
all over the state.

757
00:45:03,561 --> 00:45:05,361
First I'm going to
open gambling houses.

758
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:06,801
After that, banks.

759
00:45:06,881 --> 00:45:08,321
People will
like that idea.

760
00:45:08,361 --> 00:45:10,041
Give them someplace
to put their money.

761
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:11,681
Right in their pockets.

762
00:45:11,761 --> 00:45:14,361
Mr. Mccomb will have no
pockets unless he stands still.

763
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:17,841
This just come over the wire.

764
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,321
This isn't addressed to me.

765
00:45:19,401 --> 00:45:22,121
Why, I thought you'd
like to see it first.

766
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:25,601
Look who's coming.

767
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:26,321
Huh?

768
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:31,601
Hey. This'll be
the biggest thing

769
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:34,201
that ever happened
to silver city.

770
00:45:34,241 --> 00:45:36,481
Have we got his
brand of whiskey?

771
00:45:43,962 --> 00:45:47,122
Put some more ice in that
punch bowl. It's all melted.

772
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:49,162
Don't worry, dear. Everything's
going to be all right.

773
00:45:49,202 --> 00:45:51,842
What difference does it make? The
whole evening's spoiled anyway.

774
00:45:51,922 --> 00:45:53,202
Oh, I'm sure the president

775
00:45:53,242 --> 00:45:55,002
will be here most
any minute now.

776
00:45:55,082 --> 00:45:57,162
I'd give $1,000 to get my
hands on that Mike McComb.

777
00:45:57,242 --> 00:45:59,562
You can just bet he's
responsible for this.

778
00:45:59,642 --> 00:46:01,282
I don't think it
was very nice of him

779
00:46:01,322 --> 00:46:02,602
after all the trouble
we went to.

780
00:46:02,642 --> 00:46:05,242
He loves trouble-
especially when he's making it.

781
00:46:05,282 --> 00:46:08,642
Excuse me, mrs. Moore, but I heard the
president was over at McComb's place.

782
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,602
Oh, that's perfect.
Just perfect.

783
00:46:10,682 --> 00:46:12,642
He'll no doubt fleece him
in a card game.

784
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:14,002
Darling, darling,
don't get so upset.

785
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:15,442
Oh, I'm so mad
i could spit.

786
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:17,562
Now, Georgia.
Men will be men.

787
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:19,842
Mccomb is not a man.
He's a-

788
00:46:36,603 --> 00:46:38,603
mr. President,
mr. Chevigee, our host

789
00:46:38,683 --> 00:46:40,563
and the owner of the biggest
mine in silver city.

790
00:46:40,643 --> 00:46:42,483
That interests me
greatly.

791
00:46:42,563 --> 00:46:43,883
Mr. President.

792
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:46,203
Uh, mrs. Austin,
mrs. Howbote,

793
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:47,203
mrs., um...

794
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:47,963
Moore.

795
00:46:48,763 --> 00:46:50,443
Ah, yes, of course, the head
of our entertainment committee.

796
00:46:52,403 --> 00:46:53,843
And mr. Moore.

797
00:46:53,883 --> 00:46:55,123
A pleasure,
mr. President.

798
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:56,483
Mr. Moore.

799
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,763
Three cheers for the
president of the united states!

800
00:46:57,843 --> 00:47:02,323
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

801
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,683
I appreciate the ovation.

802
00:47:04,763 --> 00:47:07,883
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

803
00:47:07,963 --> 00:47:11,363
Now, mr. President, let me
introduce you to the punch bowl.

804
00:47:20,163 --> 00:47:22,683
Cigar, general?
Thank you.

805
00:47:22,723 --> 00:47:24,803
How about some punch?
No, no, no, no, no.

806
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:29,443
Mccomb is an amazing man.

807
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:35,404
Pardon me, mrs. Moore.

808
00:47:35,484 --> 00:47:37,484
I wonder if you could spare
your husband for a moment?

809
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:40,724
The boys would like to have you
join us for a little talk, Moore.

810
00:47:40,804 --> 00:47:42,084
Georgia?
Of course.

811
00:47:45,684 --> 00:47:47,964
There's one or two
other matters,

812
00:47:48,004 --> 00:47:49,844
but you already know
most of the story.

813
00:47:49,884 --> 00:47:51,524
I think you can tell
the other gentlemen.

814
00:47:51,604 --> 00:47:52,884
Do you have everything
you want, general?

815
00:47:52,924 --> 00:47:55,004
Everything but a dance
with you, mrs...

816
00:47:55,084 --> 00:47:56,644
Moore.

817
00:47:56,724 --> 00:47:59,924
I wish all men were
so easily pleased.

818
00:48:05,724 --> 00:48:08,524
While we're in here talking,
McComb is out there

819
00:48:08,604 --> 00:48:10,124
making policy
with the president.

820
00:48:10,204 --> 00:48:12,964
I hardly think the president
came all the way out here

821
00:48:13,004 --> 00:48:14,444
just to patronize
the punch bowl.

822
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:15,804
You're entirely right,
gentlemen.

823
00:48:15,844 --> 00:48:17,284
Shut that door.

824
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:19,844
I can tell you
it's no accident that

825
00:48:19,924 --> 00:48:22,004
the president of the united
states came to silver city.

826
00:48:22,044 --> 00:48:23,365
Although his visit's
unofficial,

827
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:25,085
what he told me is
of vital importance.

828
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:28,205
Well, if it was so important,
why didn't he talk to all of us?

829
00:48:28,285 --> 00:48:29,845
I imagine the president

830
00:48:29,885 --> 00:48:32,245
has a pretty fair idea
who he wants to talk to.

831
00:48:32,325 --> 00:48:34,445
Besides, aren't we all in
the mining business together?

832
00:48:34,485 --> 00:48:37,325
Mccomb's right, gentlemen.
Aside from personal feelings,

833
00:48:37,405 --> 00:48:39,845
we can't operate
the mines without him.

834
00:48:39,885 --> 00:48:41,325
Let's hear what
he has to say.

835
00:48:41,405 --> 00:48:43,165
Very smart. Plato,

836
00:48:43,245 --> 00:48:45,845
you were there this afternoon.
Give them the picture.

837
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:48,765
Well, as you all know,
a first great nation

838
00:48:48,805 --> 00:48:51,845
is a nation with surplus
international credits.

839
00:48:51,925 --> 00:48:53,765
Britain has her empire.

840
00:48:53,845 --> 00:48:56,725
Kimberly diamond mines,
the silver of india,

841
00:48:56,765 --> 00:48:59,125
the gold of iran
and the tin of malaya.

842
00:48:59,165 --> 00:49:01,845
Russia has
the steppes of siberia,

843
00:49:01,885 --> 00:49:04,405
rich in a hundred resources.

844
00:49:04,445 --> 00:49:06,965
What about the gold of
california, oregon, colorado?

845
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:10,485
True. The 49ers gave us
the gold exchange,

846
00:49:10,565 --> 00:49:12,405
but, gentlemen,
that's not enough.

847
00:49:12,485 --> 00:49:14,285
The big strikes
in gold are over.

848
00:49:14,325 --> 00:49:16,246
Do you know what we need now

849
00:49:16,326 --> 00:49:18,206
to make this country the
great creditor of nations?

850
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,446
Silver.

851
00:49:19,526 --> 00:49:22,246
In simple language,
gentlemen,

852
00:49:22,286 --> 00:49:24,326
here's the word
from the president.

853
00:49:24,406 --> 00:49:26,806
You've got to produce
more silver,

854
00:49:26,846 --> 00:49:30,006
even if it means working
the mines 24 hours a day.

855
00:49:30,046 --> 00:49:31,286
Digging faster,
shipping faster,

856
00:49:31,326 --> 00:49:33,606
you've got to produce
more silver.

857
00:49:33,686 --> 00:49:36,006
Up until now, of course,
everybody's been digging silver

858
00:49:36,086 --> 00:49:38,926
to see how much of it they could
stick away in their own pockets. Fine.

859
00:49:38,966 --> 00:49:40,246
But the picture's changed.

860
00:49:40,326 --> 00:49:43,446
Silver city has become more
important than all of us.

861
00:49:43,526 --> 00:49:46,486
On what we do right here depends
the very future of america.

862
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:51,206
I visualize this
territory around us here

863
00:49:51,286 --> 00:49:54,646
as the foundation
of a vast empire.

864
00:49:54,726 --> 00:49:57,486
And if you're smart, it'll begin
right here with the men in this room.

865
00:50:01,446 --> 00:50:03,246
If we try, we'll
double the silver output.

866
00:50:03,326 --> 00:50:04,486
Depend on me.

867
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:06,726
I thought you'd see
it my way, gentlemen.

868
00:50:06,806 --> 00:50:09,487
Uh, pardon me. Mine
and the president's.

869
00:50:09,527 --> 00:50:10,847
Well, drop around
to the bank tomorrow

870
00:50:10,927 --> 00:50:11,967
and we'll go into detail.

871
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:19,407
So what else could we do?
We burnt the million dollars.

872
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:24,607
What a fire. I had $35,000
worth of ashes on my hat.

873
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,247
And for that, they threw him
out of the army.

874
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:29,087
That's gratitude.

875
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:31,247
They threw you out
once, didn't they?

876
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:34,447
No... twice.

877
00:50:34,527 --> 00:50:36,767
You've got a pretty
good job now, though.

878
00:50:40,047 --> 00:50:41,687
Our dance, I believe,
mrs. Moore.

879
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:43,327
Yes, it has been nice.

880
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:47,047
Oh, you'd better.

881
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:49,847
People might think
you don't like me.

882
00:50:49,927 --> 00:50:52,607
I don't want to dance with you.

883
00:51:05,768 --> 00:51:07,648
Take me back, please.

884
00:51:07,728 --> 00:51:11,288
Why, mrs. Moore, I think you
wanted me to ask you to dance.

885
00:51:11,328 --> 00:51:12,408
You're aggressive,
aren't you?

886
00:51:12,488 --> 00:51:13,368
Mm-hmm.

887
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:14,568
But like a child.

888
00:51:14,648 --> 00:51:15,688
First you want a circus
all done up in gold braid

889
00:51:15,768 --> 00:51:17,128
and then you want-

890
00:51:17,168 --> 00:51:18,648
you.

891
00:51:18,728 --> 00:51:20,928
I'm not interested.

892
00:51:25,488 --> 00:51:27,168
May I offer you
a toast, mrs. Moore?

893
00:51:28,728 --> 00:51:31,048
To what we both
really want.

894
00:51:41,288 --> 00:51:43,128
You seem to have
spilled your drink.

895
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:46,808
Lovely party, isn't it?

896
00:51:52,808 --> 00:51:55,129
What will
i own, Plato?

897
00:51:55,209 --> 00:51:57,049
How about
a million acres, Mac?

898
00:51:57,129 --> 00:52:00,449
All the country you can
see to that far ridge.

899
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:03,329
Clear across the valley
to those peaks.

900
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:05,729
And as far north
as you can see

901
00:52:05,769 --> 00:52:07,449
across that
snow-capped ridge.

902
00:52:09,089 --> 00:52:12,449
I tell you,
it's a big undertaking,

903
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:14,649
and it'll cost you
a pretty penny.

904
00:52:17,689 --> 00:52:19,609
Plato...

905
00:52:19,689 --> 00:52:23,929
you're looking at a man
who once burnt $1 million.

906
00:52:24,009 --> 00:52:28,209
Out there... I see
100 million.

907
00:52:28,249 --> 00:52:30,009
Buy it tomorrow.

908
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:58,290
Sam slade. Sam,
who'd you tangle with?

909
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,170
Ran into a pack
of indians.

910
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,970
Black rock range.

911
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:03,570
Black rock?
Yeah.

912
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,850
I was freightin' in
a camping outfit

913
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:12,370
for eastern fellas,
prospectors.

914
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,850
Shoshonees killed
all of them.

915
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:34,370
We'd better keep this
quiet or we'll liable

916
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,330
to throw the whole town
into a panic.

917
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:54,531
Gun and a little bit of silver.
All that's left of sam slade.

918
00:53:54,611 --> 00:53:57,371
Little enough for a man
to leave, isn't it?

919
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:58,931
Come in.

920
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:04,131
Hello, Moore.
Hello, Beck.

921
00:54:04,211 --> 00:54:06,051
I know it's late,
but I've been to town

922
00:54:06,091 --> 00:54:07,851
several times today
looking for you.

923
00:54:07,931 --> 00:54:09,131
Oh? What's on
your mind?

924
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:11,691
You know, we've been getting
out a lot of ore, all of us.

925
00:54:11,771 --> 00:54:13,611
Mines are working
at full capacity.

926
00:54:13,691 --> 00:54:14,891
Still, it's not enough.

927
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:16,571
I know it.

928
00:54:16,611 --> 00:54:18,131
Got any suggestions?

929
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:20,331
That night at chevigee's
i told you

930
00:54:20,411 --> 00:54:22,371
i thought there was still
untouched, undeveloped fields.

931
00:54:22,451 --> 00:54:24,851
Sure, I remember.
We need new fields.

932
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:27,171
Well, we're not the only ones
who think so.

933
00:54:27,251 --> 00:54:29,291
I heard a prospecting party
went out just the other day.

934
00:54:29,331 --> 00:54:32,051
That means other companies
have the same idea.

935
00:54:32,091 --> 00:54:33,972
We can't let them
get away from us.

936
00:54:34,012 --> 00:54:35,292
Where is this country?

937
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:38,092
Black rock range,
about a day's ride away.

938
00:54:38,132 --> 00:54:40,412
That's the shoshonee
indian country, boy.

939
00:54:40,492 --> 00:54:41,652
I know.

940
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:50,572
And, uh, you think there
might be silver there?

941
00:54:50,652 --> 00:54:52,892
I'm sure of it.

942
00:54:52,932 --> 00:54:54,972
Of course, that's
pretty rugged country.

943
00:54:55,012 --> 00:54:56,412
After all,
you're a married man.

944
00:54:56,452 --> 00:54:58,052
You're wife,
she might not like it.

945
00:54:58,132 --> 00:54:59,652
I'm a mining engineer, McComb.

946
00:54:59,732 --> 00:55:03,132
Here, let me
show you on the map.

947
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:05,612
The range of mountains
runs right along here.

948
00:55:05,652 --> 00:55:08,852
They have the same type of
outcroppings on that range

949
00:55:08,892 --> 00:55:10,612
as we have here where we're
getting silver right now,

950
00:55:10,692 --> 00:55:13,812
and I believe that if we
go right in this area,

951
00:55:13,892 --> 00:55:16,292
we have an excellent chance
of making a big strike.

952
00:55:16,332 --> 00:55:19,332
I want to go out there and
take a few samples of the ore.

953
00:55:19,372 --> 00:55:21,812
If they prove to be as rich as I have
every reason to believe they will,

954
00:55:21,892 --> 00:55:23,772
we can double our output.

955
00:55:32,133 --> 00:55:33,213
Good night, Beck.

956
00:55:33,293 --> 00:55:34,093
'Night.

957
00:55:35,693 --> 00:55:38,533
Good night, sweet prince.

958
00:55:38,613 --> 00:55:41,733
Lights of angels,
sing thee to thy rest.

959
00:55:47,693 --> 00:55:50,053
Looks like a long drink.

960
00:55:50,093 --> 00:55:52,413
It's gonna be a long night.

961
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,413
You silly old...

962
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:59,453
Plato, you still need that
stuff to see you through a night?

963
00:55:59,493 --> 00:56:01,933
I will for what
i want to say.

964
00:56:02,013 --> 00:56:05,013
Oh, a speech, huh?

965
00:56:05,093 --> 00:56:06,333
It's a good speech.

966
00:56:12,693 --> 00:56:15,053
A speech about
the truth.

967
00:56:15,093 --> 00:56:17,413
I used to like
the truth, Mike.

968
00:56:17,453 --> 00:56:19,414
Well, we all do, don't we?

969
00:56:19,494 --> 00:56:23,334
Ha! Not you,
you run from it.

970
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:27,014
My speech is about
the human soul.

971
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:29,254
Do you believe in
the human soul?

972
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:31,094
I believe in myself.

973
00:56:31,134 --> 00:56:34,614
Then you're wasting
your time.

974
00:56:34,654 --> 00:56:36,534
You know why?

975
00:56:36,574 --> 00:56:39,934
All right... why?

976
00:56:40,014 --> 00:56:43,254
Because you're
no good, Mike.

977
00:56:43,294 --> 00:56:45,494
You're no good.

978
00:56:49,094 --> 00:56:50,934
The defense rests.

979
00:56:51,014 --> 00:56:52,854
Did you ever read the bible?

980
00:56:52,934 --> 00:56:54,054
Not lately, no.

981
00:56:54,134 --> 00:56:56,414
Well, it's all
written there.

982
00:56:56,454 --> 00:57:00,174
The whole story about
a king called david.

983
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:02,454
You know what he wanted, too?

984
00:57:02,494 --> 00:57:03,934
A woman.

985
00:57:04,014 --> 00:57:07,614
A woman he saw one day
bathing in the garden.

986
00:57:07,654 --> 00:57:09,654
Mm-hmm. Go on.

987
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:12,255
And david desired this woman,

988
00:57:12,335 --> 00:57:14,375
and he lusted for her...

989
00:57:16,455 --> 00:57:20,255
but she was the wife
of one of his captains,

990
00:57:20,335 --> 00:57:24,415
and he sent the captain
off to the wars,

991
00:57:24,455 --> 00:57:28,775
and he placed him in
the full of the battle,

992
00:57:28,855 --> 00:57:31,095
and this captain was killed,

993
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:38,015
and the king took the wife of
this slain captain for his own.

994
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:40,135
And that's not all.
You've forgotten something.

995
00:57:40,215 --> 00:57:41,175
What?

996
00:57:41,255 --> 00:57:43,815
The king loved
that woman, didn't he?

997
00:57:43,895 --> 00:57:46,295
David loved her with
an all-consuming passion.

998
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,055
Didn't he?!

999
00:57:47,815 --> 00:57:49,775
That's not important!

1000
00:57:49,815 --> 00:57:54,215
Of course it's not important, not
to you, you cold boston codfish.

1001
00:57:54,255 --> 00:57:56,175
You and your sermons.

1002
00:57:56,255 --> 00:57:58,575
You get 'em out
of a bottle, Beck.

1003
00:57:58,655 --> 00:58:01,015
You want to make up rules
for other people to live by

1004
00:58:01,095 --> 00:58:03,215
because you've forgotten
how to live yourself.

1005
00:58:03,295 --> 00:58:04,855
You're a drunk and
sanctimonious hypocrite-

1006
00:59:16,697 --> 00:59:19,497
don't do it, Mike.

1007
00:59:19,577 --> 00:59:23,737
Don't send Moore to
that shoshonee country.

1008
00:59:25,337 --> 00:59:27,697
Don't do it.

1009
00:59:27,777 --> 00:59:29,457
Don't do that.

1010
00:59:29,497 --> 00:59:31,617
Not even you.

1011
00:59:33,057 --> 00:59:35,617
Aw, don't do it, Mike.

1012
00:59:37,497 --> 00:59:40,377
All right, take it up to the
cookhouse and check it in.

1013
00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:55,898
Hello, i, uh... want to have
a little talk with you.

1014
00:59:55,978 --> 00:59:56,858
What about?

1015
00:59:56,938 --> 00:59:58,498
Oh, about your husband.

1016
00:59:58,578 --> 01:00:01,538
Why talk to me? My husband
takes care of his own business.

1017
01:00:01,618 --> 01:00:02,938
Besides, he's gone.

1018
01:00:03,018 --> 01:00:05,698
Gone? I didn't think-

1019
01:00:05,738 --> 01:00:08,098
Georgia,
he's gotta be stopped.

1020
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:10,018
Oh, I guess you've
thought it over

1021
01:00:10,058 --> 01:00:12,098
and now you're going
to change your mind.

1022
01:00:12,138 --> 01:00:14,938
Leave stanley alone. He knows
mining. It's his business.

1023
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,818
Look, there's something
I've got to tell you.

1024
01:00:17,858 --> 01:00:20,058
He's gone up in the black
rock range. I know that.

1025
01:00:20,138 --> 01:00:22,298
I don't think you
understand, though.

1026
01:00:22,338 --> 01:00:25,018
I just found out the
shoshonees are on the warpath.

1027
01:00:25,098 --> 01:00:26,778
You know what that
means, don't you?

1028
01:00:26,818 --> 01:00:28,338
They already killed
a party of prospectors.

1029
01:00:28,418 --> 01:00:29,218
Shoshonees?

1030
01:00:30,818 --> 01:00:32,098
How long ago did he leave?

1031
01:00:32,178 --> 01:00:34,018
At dawn this morning.

1032
01:00:34,098 --> 01:00:35,258
I'm going after him.

1033
01:00:35,338 --> 01:00:37,818
Mccomb, I want to go, too.

1034
01:00:37,898 --> 01:00:40,178
No, you'd better stay here.
I'll take some of your men.

1035
01:00:40,258 --> 01:00:41,658
We ought to be able
to catch him.

1036
01:00:54,339 --> 01:00:56,459
Get on your horses
and follow me.

1037
01:01:01,419 --> 01:01:03,099
Get on your horses
and follow me.

1038
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:55,820
Pardon me.

1039
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:10,260
I, uh...

1040
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,220
we didn't get there
soon enough, Georgia.

1041
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,900
Well, king david, I see you've
brought the warrior home.

1042
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,781
I believe we've been too hasty

1043
01:03:09,861 --> 01:03:13,501
in discharging our obligations
to the late mr. Moore.

1044
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:16,141
We've written no epitaph.

1045
01:03:16,181 --> 01:03:19,181
Well, I'll speak one.

1046
01:03:19,221 --> 01:03:22,701
Nature might stand to
all the world and say

1047
01:03:22,741 --> 01:03:26,182
this was a man,
a man betrayed.

1048
01:03:26,262 --> 01:03:29,022
I don't believe
i need to identify

1049
01:03:29,062 --> 01:03:31,222
the gentleman who
victimized him.

1050
01:03:31,302 --> 01:03:34,142
He was among us today,
not to mourn,

1051
01:03:34,222 --> 01:03:37,222
but to claim the rewards
of his treachery.

1052
01:04:02,022 --> 01:04:03,182
Good morning, mr. Mccomb.

1053
01:04:03,262 --> 01:04:04,942
Good morning, edwards.

1054
01:04:05,022 --> 01:04:06,862
Well, what do you think
of this site?

1055
01:04:06,942 --> 01:04:08,382
Oh, it's excellent,
excellent,

1056
01:04:08,422 --> 01:04:11,462
but do you think a castle
will blend with this landscape?

1057
01:04:11,542 --> 01:04:13,022
Blend? In the landscape?

1058
01:04:13,102 --> 01:04:16,023
Look, edwards, I don't intend
to blend with any landscape.

1059
01:04:16,063 --> 01:04:18,263
I intend to fill it.
Yes, sir.

1060
01:04:18,343 --> 01:04:21,263
Now, look. I want a big
magnificent house, gothic style.

1061
01:04:21,343 --> 01:04:23,343
I want it built
in white marble. White.

1062
01:04:23,383 --> 01:04:25,303
But there's no marble in
this part of the country.

1063
01:04:25,383 --> 01:04:27,303
Then get marble.
And look, edwards,

1064
01:04:27,343 --> 01:04:30,303
on both sides of the main entrance
i want wings stretching out.

1065
01:04:30,343 --> 01:04:32,743
Mr. Mccomb, I'd like to talk this
over at greater length with you.

1066
01:04:32,783 --> 01:04:34,303
I'm still rather confused.

1067
01:04:34,343 --> 01:04:35,663
Hurry it up, edwards.
Good-bye.

1068
01:04:40,823 --> 01:04:43,263
"Michael j. Mccomb."

1069
01:04:45,063 --> 01:04:47,223
"Mike McComb,
who brags he once burned

1070
01:04:47,263 --> 01:04:48,863
"a million dollars
of army payroll

1071
01:04:48,943 --> 01:04:50,783
"and ran
a roulette wheel into

1072
01:04:50,863 --> 01:04:52,783
"the largest silver
syndicate in the west,

1073
01:04:52,863 --> 01:04:56,423
"expanding his interests
into cattle, wheat and lumber,

1074
01:04:56,463 --> 01:04:58,983
"is now building
a castle in the desert

1075
01:04:59,023 --> 01:05:00,503
from which to rule
his growing empire."

1076
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:01,463
Hello, chevigee.

1077
01:05:01,543 --> 01:05:02,583
Where is McComb?

1078
01:05:02,663 --> 01:05:05,143
Haven't you heard?
Mrs. Moore is coming in

1079
01:05:05,223 --> 01:05:08,183
on that san francisco
stage this afternoon.

1080
01:05:08,263 --> 01:05:09,504
You'll find him
down there.

1081
01:05:15,664 --> 01:05:17,144
Stage from san francisco.

1082
01:05:17,224 --> 01:05:20,824
Stage from san francisco.

1083
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:23,184
Welcome home.

1084
01:05:23,224 --> 01:05:24,584
It's nice to be back.

1085
01:05:24,664 --> 01:05:26,424
I've brought my carriage
here for you.

1086
01:05:26,504 --> 01:05:27,744
Thank you.

1087
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:28,704
You look well.

1088
01:05:28,784 --> 01:05:30,184
Do i?

1089
01:05:31,664 --> 01:05:35,064
What am I talking about?
You look beautiful.

1090
01:05:35,144 --> 01:05:36,984
Can this be
the old Mike McComb?

1091
01:05:37,064 --> 01:05:37,864
No.

1092
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:57,064
You've been gone
a long time.

1093
01:05:58,824 --> 01:06:01,264
If you didn't come in today
i was coming after you.

1094
01:06:03,065 --> 01:06:05,985
I don't want you to make
any plans for a week.

1095
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:10,385
Every day for a week.

1096
01:06:17,705 --> 01:06:20,505
We're the same kind
of people, you and i.

1097
01:06:20,545 --> 01:06:22,145
Maybe that's the trouble.

1098
01:06:22,225 --> 01:06:24,825
I'm not sure if we'd
be good for each other.

1099
01:06:24,905 --> 01:06:27,265
One minute we're
fighting like wildcats,

1100
01:06:27,345 --> 01:06:29,585
the next we're in love.

1101
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:31,865
It certainly took you
a long time to say that.

1102
01:06:31,945 --> 01:06:33,105
I never wanted to.

1103
01:06:33,145 --> 01:06:34,225
You just did.

1104
01:06:34,305 --> 01:06:36,585
It's not as simple as that.

1105
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,785
It would be if you'd
just stop talking.

1106
01:06:46,785 --> 01:06:48,905
I don't think it's
going to be so difficult

1107
01:06:48,985 --> 01:06:50,425
for us to get along.

1108
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:52,985
You almost had me
fooled for a minute,

1109
01:06:53,025 --> 01:06:55,146
but you haven't changed
a bit, Mike McComb.

1110
01:06:55,226 --> 01:06:59,426
Everything out there,
as far as you can see,

1111
01:06:59,506 --> 01:07:00,866
will be yours.

1112
01:07:00,946 --> 01:07:02,386
It's empty land.

1113
01:07:02,466 --> 01:07:04,626
Now, maybe, but it's not
going to stay that way.

1114
01:07:04,706 --> 01:07:06,986
One day,
you mark my words,

1115
01:07:07,026 --> 01:07:09,146
there'll be cities
out there.

1116
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:12,146
Railroads, water,
things growing.

1117
01:07:12,226 --> 01:07:16,106
A whole new world created
from a silver river.

1118
01:07:16,186 --> 01:07:18,186
They'll remember you then.

1119
01:07:18,266 --> 01:07:19,666
Me?
Sure.

1120
01:07:19,746 --> 01:07:22,146
They'll say it was all done
for the love of a woman.

1121
01:07:23,626 --> 01:07:24,986
Let's be honest, Mike.

1122
01:07:25,026 --> 01:07:27,986
You were taking care of yourself
long before I ever came along.

1123
01:07:28,026 --> 01:07:31,386
I'm sure nothing in the world
could have stopped you, or can now.

1124
01:07:31,466 --> 01:07:33,426
I don't want to be stopped.

1125
01:07:40,186 --> 01:07:42,186
It isn't going to be as easy

1126
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:43,786
as taking those wagons
away from me.

1127
01:07:50,427 --> 01:07:51,627
Mr. Burns?
What's this?

1128
01:07:51,707 --> 01:07:54,707
An invitation to
Mike McComb's housewarming.

1129
01:07:54,787 --> 01:07:56,067
I'll go.

1130
01:07:56,147 --> 01:07:57,427
It ain't gonna be that warm.

1131
01:07:57,467 --> 01:08:00,267
Everything in the house
is imported from europe.

1132
01:08:00,347 --> 01:08:03,307
Mr. Blake, mr. Chevigee,

1133
01:08:03,387 --> 01:08:05,347
and one for
the attorney.

1134
01:08:05,427 --> 01:08:06,907
Don't miss
this party, men.

1135
01:08:06,987 --> 01:08:09,027
800 cases
of real champagne.

1136
01:08:09,107 --> 01:08:11,387
Look at this. Well, what do you expect?

1137
01:08:11,467 --> 01:08:13,227
Very fancy,
but I'm not going.

1138
01:08:13,307 --> 01:08:16,107
I'm going to stay home
and so's my wife.

1139
01:08:16,187 --> 01:08:18,427
You'll go, gentlemen,
and so will your wives.

1140
01:08:18,507 --> 01:08:20,627
The king is now in his castle.

1141
01:08:20,707 --> 01:08:22,307
This is not an invitation.

1142
01:08:22,347 --> 01:08:25,267
It's a command. Louie!

1143
01:08:25,347 --> 01:08:27,827
I'll trade you mine
for another drink.

1144
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:37,307
Yes, sir, everything
in that room's imported.

1145
01:08:37,387 --> 01:08:40,307
Look at that clock.
Got that from switzerland.

1146
01:08:40,387 --> 01:08:42,908
Got some cheese from there, too.
You'll get some of that later.

1147
01:08:42,988 --> 01:08:46,468
Now that's the front door. That's
where you came in. You saw that.

1148
01:08:46,508 --> 01:08:48,428
Now upstairs are the bedrooms.
Ten of 'em.

1149
01:08:48,468 --> 01:08:51,308
One big one. And that
light hanging up there...

1150
01:08:51,348 --> 01:08:52,628
that's imported, too.

1151
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:54,068
All the way from
philadelphia.

1152
01:08:54,148 --> 01:08:55,988
If we have time later
I'll take you down

1153
01:08:56,068 --> 01:08:58,388
and show you
the wine cellar.

1154
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,548
Full of imported wine,
beer and cigars.

1155
01:09:00,628 --> 01:09:03,748
Now you see that door
and that ceiling?

1156
01:09:03,828 --> 01:09:06,428
Mike had that taken right
out of a french castle.

1157
01:09:06,508 --> 01:09:08,948
Cost us a fortune.

1158
01:09:09,028 --> 01:09:10,348
And here, this is
the dining room in here.

1159
01:09:10,388 --> 01:09:12,028
Wait till you see that.

1160
01:09:12,108 --> 01:09:14,388
Wait till we see it? We've
been here for over an hour.

1161
01:09:14,468 --> 01:09:16,468
Yes, mr. Porter,
all this is very lovely,

1162
01:09:16,548 --> 01:09:18,308
but where are our
host and hostess?

1163
01:09:18,348 --> 01:09:22,028
We're terrible,
keeping them all waiting.

1164
01:09:22,068 --> 01:09:24,828
You just say the word and
I'll throw them all out.

1165
01:09:24,868 --> 01:09:26,508
You'll do nothing
of the kind.

1166
01:09:27,668 --> 01:09:28,548
You look beautiful.

1167
01:09:28,628 --> 01:09:30,628
Thank you.

1168
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:36,269
Well, hello, chevigee,
seen the house?

1169
01:09:36,349 --> 01:09:38,269
What a lovely gown,
mrs. Mccomb. Thank you.

1170
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:40,509
Dinner is served.

1171
01:09:40,589 --> 01:09:41,909
Shall we go in?

1172
01:09:59,909 --> 01:10:01,789
Your kind indulgence,
ladies and gentlemen.

1173
01:10:01,829 --> 01:10:04,629
I'd merely like to say
how happy I am

1174
01:10:04,669 --> 01:10:07,429
to think that so many
of our invited guests

1175
01:10:07,509 --> 01:10:09,469
found time to grace our table.

1176
01:10:09,509 --> 01:10:12,309
Indeed, it's not often
that a man finds himself

1177
01:10:12,389 --> 01:10:15,429
honored by the presence
of so many...

1178
01:10:15,509 --> 01:10:18,909
so many loyal,
trustworthy friends.

1179
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:19,989
Huh, chevigee?

1180
01:10:20,069 --> 01:10:22,829
Oh, uh, yes, yes,
to be sure.

1181
01:10:24,389 --> 01:10:26,509
Now, if I may,
I'd like to propose a toast.

1182
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:31,310
To the silver queen,
mrs. Mike McComb.

1183
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:37,750
Well, I seem to remember
my father telling me

1184
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:39,590
on an occasion
somewhat similar to this-

1185
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:42,830
be brief, be sincere,
and be seated.

1186
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:45,150
We're greatly indebted
to mr. And mrs. Mccomb

1187
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:46,870
for their gracious
hospitality.

1188
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:49,070
Much happiness to them.

1189
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:53,710
Now I'll tell one.

1190
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,910
Ha! Plato.

1191
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:59,790
With a respectful bow
to our beautiful hostess,

1192
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:03,270
i propose a toast
to mr. Mccomb,

1193
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:05,030
my old friend.

1194
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:07,230
Indeed, we should
all honor him.

1195
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:11,550
His name marks
our schools, our banks,

1196
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:15,510
and one day, maybe,
our finish.

1197
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:18,230
Ladies and gentlemen, you're
in the presence of a great man.

1198
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,831
A mighty man.

1199
01:11:20,911 --> 01:11:21,791
Are there any takers?

1200
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:22,871
Easy, Plato.

1201
01:11:22,951 --> 01:11:25,111
Easy is the word.

1202
01:11:25,191 --> 01:11:28,111
Remember to say "please"
and "thank you" to mr. Mccomb.

1203
01:11:28,151 --> 01:11:30,111
He likes to be thanked.

1204
01:11:30,191 --> 01:11:33,671
Mr. Mccomb is offended
by my conduct.

1205
01:11:33,711 --> 01:11:36,751
He believes in the dignity
of man-one man.

1206
01:11:36,831 --> 01:11:39,831
Why should caesar
be a tyrant then?

1207
01:11:39,871 --> 01:11:41,111
Ask Mike McComb.

1208
01:11:41,151 --> 01:11:44,311
He knows all about tyrants.

1209
01:11:44,351 --> 01:11:45,871
But let's look at the man.

1210
01:11:45,951 --> 01:11:49,191
The whole man,
the good and the bad.

1211
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:53,391
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is no whole man.

1212
01:11:53,431 --> 01:11:56,111
Let's consider him,
then, a serpent's egg.

1213
01:11:56,151 --> 01:11:58,391
And kill him in the shell.

1214
01:11:58,471 --> 01:11:59,751
Get out of here.

1215
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:02,871
Get out,
you drunken old fool.

1216
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,791
You're no good, Mike.
You're rotten!

1217
01:12:05,831 --> 01:12:08,711
Rotten clean through!

1218
01:12:08,751 --> 01:12:11,271
You hear me? I'm through
with you, finished.

1219
01:12:11,311 --> 01:12:13,472
You think you run
the world now

1220
01:12:13,512 --> 01:12:15,392
but that won't last,
king david.

1221
01:12:15,472 --> 01:12:17,592
See that he gets home
all right, pistol.

1222
01:12:17,632 --> 01:12:18,792
Did I ever tell you
the story of king david?

1223
01:12:18,872 --> 01:12:20,632
Let me tell her
that story.

1224
01:12:20,712 --> 01:12:21,872
Later.

1225
01:12:21,912 --> 01:12:23,512
Shall we go into
the drawing room?

1226
01:12:23,552 --> 01:12:25,632
I'm afraid I can't stay.

1227
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:30,672
It's been a pleasure, sir.

1228
01:12:35,272 --> 01:12:37,472
Good night, mrs. Mccomb.

1229
01:12:37,512 --> 01:12:38,672
Good night.

1230
01:12:40,552 --> 01:12:41,952
Good night, mr. Mccomb.

1231
01:12:41,992 --> 01:12:43,152
Good night, mrs. Mccomb.

1232
01:13:02,392 --> 01:13:03,752
Mike.

1233
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:10,433
Lovely housewarming,
wasn't it?

1234
01:13:10,473 --> 01:13:13,553
I hope you don't mind
everyone's leaving so early.

1235
01:13:13,633 --> 01:13:16,353
Mind? I wonder why we bothered
with them in the first place.

1236
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:20,113
But Plato. I don't understand
his acting like that.

1237
01:13:20,193 --> 01:13:22,313
Oh, it was just
the liquor talking.

1238
01:13:22,393 --> 01:13:23,713
What did he mean
about king david?

1239
01:13:23,793 --> 01:13:25,753
What did he mean
about david?

1240
01:13:25,793 --> 01:13:27,833
Who knows what goes
through the mind of a drunk?

1241
01:13:27,913 --> 01:13:29,753
One minute he's
talking about caesar

1242
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:31,673
the next about
serpent's eggs.

1243
01:13:31,753 --> 01:13:33,673
But it was so strange.

1244
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:34,833
Forget it.

1245
01:14:03,394 --> 01:14:04,794
Oh, good morning,
mr. Mccomb.

1246
01:14:04,874 --> 01:14:06,314
Morning, mr. Mccomb.

1247
01:14:06,354 --> 01:14:07,794
Morning, mr. Mccomb.
Morning, mr. Mccomb.

1248
01:14:07,834 --> 01:14:10,954
Good morning, mr. Mccomb.
Morning, mr. Mccomb.

1249
01:14:12,154 --> 01:14:14,194
Well, it's about time
you got back.

1250
01:14:14,274 --> 01:14:15,754
I've been trying to
get in touch with you.

1251
01:14:15,834 --> 01:14:16,874
Have you?

1252
01:14:16,914 --> 01:14:18,034
Well, the mrs. And i
thought we'd leave

1253
01:14:18,114 --> 01:14:20,634
business to the rest of you for awhile.

1254
01:14:20,674 --> 01:14:21,674
Ah.

1255
01:14:21,754 --> 01:14:22,914
The harvard lampoon.

1256
01:14:22,954 --> 01:14:25,514
Very educational.

1257
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:26,914
Somebody must've
left it here.

1258
01:14:26,994 --> 01:14:29,114
I've been keeping my
eye on things, Mike.

1259
01:14:29,154 --> 01:14:30,714
Did you get those
reports I sent you?

1260
01:14:30,754 --> 01:14:33,114
I haven't been doing much reading
lately. What is it, shaeffer?

1261
01:14:33,154 --> 01:14:36,834
These were will require your
immediate attention, mr. Mccomb.

1262
01:14:36,914 --> 01:14:38,234
I don't know what
you'll say to this,

1263
01:14:38,314 --> 01:14:39,954
but mr. Chevigee
and the other mine owners

1264
01:14:40,034 --> 01:14:41,874
have withdrawn their money
from this bank

1265
01:14:41,914 --> 01:14:45,714
and have arranged to transact
their business in san francisco.

1266
01:14:45,794 --> 01:14:47,154
San francisco.
That's a long way.

1267
01:14:47,234 --> 01:14:50,314
They, uh, call themselves
the western combine.

1268
01:14:50,354 --> 01:14:51,595
Short and simple.

1269
01:14:51,675 --> 01:14:52,995
What does that mean
to us, Mike?

1270
01:14:53,075 --> 01:14:55,315
I'm not sure.

1271
01:14:55,395 --> 01:14:59,395
They still have to have
their payrolls met in my bank.

1272
01:14:59,475 --> 01:15:01,755
Only from now on,
shaeffer,

1273
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:04,235
i only want the payrolls of
the silver river mines met.

1274
01:15:04,315 --> 01:15:05,195
Is that clear?

1275
01:15:05,275 --> 01:15:06,235
Yes, sir.

1276
01:15:06,315 --> 01:15:07,635
That'll bring 'em around.

1277
01:15:07,675 --> 01:15:08,835
It should.

1278
01:15:08,915 --> 01:15:10,075
Where's Beck?

1279
01:15:10,155 --> 01:15:11,955
I haven't seen him.
I looked in all the bars.

1280
01:15:11,995 --> 01:15:13,395
He must have left town.

1281
01:15:13,435 --> 01:15:14,875
Left town?

1282
01:15:14,955 --> 01:15:16,875
Probably out looking
for a new saloon.

1283
01:15:25,315 --> 01:15:28,155
Looks like chevigee and the
boys haven't wasted any time.

1284
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:53,676
Hello, Beck.

1285
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:54,876
Hello, chevigee.

1286
01:15:54,956 --> 01:15:56,156
We learned
you were in town.

1287
01:15:56,196 --> 01:15:58,316
We'd like to talk over
a little proposition.

1288
01:15:58,396 --> 01:16:00,596
Now since you handle a
lot of McComb's business,

1289
01:16:00,676 --> 01:16:01,636
we thought...

1290
01:16:01,676 --> 01:16:02,916
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

1291
01:16:02,996 --> 01:16:04,956
I have plans of my own.

1292
01:16:05,036 --> 01:16:07,836
Besides, I'm not in sympathy
with your war over silver.

1293
01:16:12,396 --> 01:16:14,036
It's rumored that you're
going into politics, mr. Beck.

1294
01:16:19,516 --> 01:16:21,556
Why did McComb move
his offices out here?

1295
01:16:21,636 --> 01:16:23,356
We're working
24 hours a day.

1296
01:16:23,436 --> 01:16:25,076
Got our own
telegraph wire in there.

1297
01:16:27,676 --> 01:16:29,516
Mrs. Mccomb, I think you'd
better tell your husband

1298
01:16:29,596 --> 01:16:30,636
i can't get his price
for the warehouse.

1299
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:32,076
He oughta settle
for half.

1300
01:16:32,156 --> 01:16:34,836
Keep trying, mr. Taylor. Mr.
Mccomb never settles for half.

1301
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:36,476
Mrs. Mccomb, I've
been waiting for hours.

1302
01:16:36,516 --> 01:16:38,077
Well, make
yourself comfortable.

1303
01:16:38,157 --> 01:16:39,597
What goes on here?

1304
01:16:39,677 --> 01:16:41,037
Mccomb rushed me
out here from denver.

1305
01:16:41,117 --> 01:16:43,077
Now he lets me sit here
and cool my heels.

1306
01:16:43,157 --> 01:16:44,997
If that doesn't work,
try cooling your temper.

1307
01:16:45,077 --> 01:16:46,277
Name's rice,
mrs. Mccomb.

1308
01:16:46,357 --> 01:16:47,637
I'm from
the san francisco telegram.

1309
01:16:47,717 --> 01:16:48,757
They call you the silver
queen, don't they, ma'am?

1310
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:49,997
That's right.

1311
01:16:50,037 --> 01:16:51,317
Well, what do you
think of the silver war?

1312
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,477
Where I come from,
this is a skirmish.

1313
01:16:53,517 --> 01:16:54,997
Pardon me, gentlemen.

1314
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:56,437
Tracey, you were the one
who talked me into

1315
01:16:56,517 --> 01:16:58,797
buying this land for half a
million dollars, weren't you?

1316
01:16:58,837 --> 01:17:00,197
Now when I want you
to sell it for a profit,

1317
01:17:00,237 --> 01:17:01,797
you mean to say
it's not worth it?

1318
01:17:01,837 --> 01:17:02,717
No, it isn't,
mr. Mccomb.

1319
01:17:02,757 --> 01:17:03,757
Aw, what are you
talking about?

1320
01:17:03,877 --> 01:17:05,117
Tell 'em there's gold in it. Come on.

1321
01:17:05,157 --> 01:17:06,077
What goes?

1322
01:17:06,117 --> 01:17:07,557
Not so good.

1323
01:17:07,637 --> 01:17:08,797
Looks like the bottom's
dropping out.

1324
01:17:08,877 --> 01:17:10,877
It's down
another 50 points.

1325
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:12,517
Now listen, all of you.

1326
01:17:12,597 --> 01:17:14,357
I don't know where chevigee
and the rest of the combine

1327
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:16,157
are getting their money, but
they're getting it somewhere.

1328
01:17:16,237 --> 01:17:18,357
That means I've gotta
match 'em dollar for dollar.

1329
01:17:18,437 --> 01:17:20,237
Mike, maybe I'm wrong,

1330
01:17:20,277 --> 01:17:21,557
but wouldn't it
be a good idea

1331
01:17:21,597 --> 01:17:23,477
to put the properties on
the market one at a time?

1332
01:17:23,557 --> 01:17:24,957
Well, of course.
I thought that was understood.

1333
01:17:25,037 --> 01:17:26,637
Don't make it look
like I'm selling out.

1334
01:17:26,677 --> 01:17:28,197
For instance, tifton,
whenever you sell a ranch

1335
01:17:28,237 --> 01:17:29,877
wait awhile before
you list the next one.

1336
01:17:29,957 --> 01:17:32,678
Those, uh, dance halls are
worth something, aren't they?

1337
01:17:32,718 --> 01:17:35,038
Aw, no. No, I don't wanna sell those.

1338
01:17:35,078 --> 01:17:36,798
After all, that's
where the ready cash is.

1339
01:17:36,838 --> 01:17:38,078
That's something
tangible.

1340
01:17:38,118 --> 01:17:39,398
Don't forget
that's where you started.

1341
01:17:39,478 --> 01:17:41,278
You ain't gonna
sell 'em, are you, Mike?

1342
01:17:41,318 --> 01:17:42,718
Oh, pistol just
likes the girls.

1343
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,358
Hmm.

1344
01:17:46,398 --> 01:17:47,838
I think you'd like
to see me get rid

1345
01:17:47,878 --> 01:17:50,038
of those dance halls,
wouldn't you?

1346
01:17:50,078 --> 01:17:51,918
All right.
Sell 'em, tracey.

1347
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,478
Now, you all understand
the plans, do you?

1348
01:17:53,558 --> 01:17:55,038
Mccomb, a message from the east.

1349
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:00,558
The eastern syndicate lend
support to smash McComb.

1350
01:18:00,638 --> 01:18:01,958
Ah.

1351
01:18:01,998 --> 01:18:03,878
So that's where they're getting
the money, is it?

1352
01:18:05,438 --> 01:18:07,678
Gentlemen, disregard
everything I said.

1353
01:18:07,718 --> 01:18:09,718
I want every penny of cash
you can lay your hands on.

1354
01:18:09,798 --> 01:18:11,558
You get it?
Sell everything.

1355
01:18:11,598 --> 01:18:13,918
I said everything.
You heard me, didn't you?

1356
01:18:13,998 --> 01:18:15,798
All right, gentlemen, be kind
enough to get out of here.

1357
01:18:15,878 --> 01:18:17,238
I got business.

1358
01:18:21,718 --> 01:18:24,359
Mike, there are newspaper reporters
out there from all over the country.

1359
01:18:24,439 --> 01:18:25,719
They've been
waiting for hours.

1360
01:18:25,799 --> 01:18:27,039
Maybe you'd better
see them now.

1361
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:28,199
Oh, let 'em wait.

1362
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:31,439
Well...

1363
01:18:31,479 --> 01:18:33,679
i never did like
things that came easy.

1364
01:18:33,759 --> 01:18:35,519
This time, it looks they're
gonna give us a run for the money.

1365
01:18:35,559 --> 01:18:36,679
I know.

1366
01:18:36,759 --> 01:18:38,559
But we'll give 'em
as good as we get.

1367
01:18:38,599 --> 01:18:40,079
Better.

1368
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:41,439
I'm glad you said
"we", Mike.

1369
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:44,479
You don't think I've
forgotten you, do you?

1370
01:18:44,559 --> 01:18:46,079
Georgia, I'd be no good
without you anymore.

1371
01:18:46,119 --> 01:18:47,399
Are we going
to beat them?

1372
01:18:47,479 --> 01:18:48,799
You bet we will.

1373
01:18:48,839 --> 01:18:51,199
I've already forced some of
their mines to close down.

1374
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:52,679
And before
I'm through,

1375
01:18:52,759 --> 01:18:54,399
I'll close every mine
in this territory.

1376
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:56,599
You said this was
between you and chevigee.

1377
01:18:56,639 --> 01:18:58,959
But when you start talking
about closing the mines,

1378
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:01,439
l- I just
don't understand.

1379
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:05,119
Mr. Mccomb, a reply
from thompson in san francisco.

1380
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,479
Read it.

1381
01:19:06,519 --> 01:19:09,759
Urgently need $300,000
cash.

1382
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,680
We can thank McComb
for all this.

1383
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,880
Yes, and them a livin' in
that fancy house of theirs yet.

1384
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:49,720
Well, boys, how do you like it
since McComb shut down the mines?

1385
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,720
Talking ain't gonna open
'em up again, sweeney.

1386
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,120
If I was in your shoes,

1387
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,240
I'd go and have
a talk with McComb.

1388
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,800
Well, you ain't
in our shoes.

1389
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,120
We haven't even got 15
cents to buy a drink with.

1390
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,440
You stick with me and I'll buy
you all the drinks you want.

1391
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,960
Where'd you get all
the pay dirt, sweeney?

1392
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,120
I got the right
kind of friends.

1393
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,080
And I don't mean him!

1394
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,681
I'll vote for him if he
can open up the mines again.

1395
01:20:11,721 --> 01:20:13,161
Why don't you
get smart?

1396
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:15,761
Beck used to work for McComb.
He probably still does.

1397
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:17,041
Now, take these
to my office,

1398
01:20:17,121 --> 01:20:18,761
and pick me up
around 8:00.

1399
01:20:18,801 --> 01:20:19,641
Yes, sir.

1400
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:23,281
Whoa, boy.
Plato! Plato Beck!

1401
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:25,561
Hello, Georgia.

1402
01:20:25,601 --> 01:20:27,161
We've missed you.

1403
01:20:27,201 --> 01:20:29,561
Well, I haven't been far
from the sound of Mike's name.

1404
01:20:29,641 --> 01:20:30,881
They're talking about
him all over the state.

1405
01:20:30,961 --> 01:20:32,321
I hope you haven't
been listening

1406
01:20:32,401 --> 01:20:34,041
to the wrong side
in your campaigning.

1407
01:20:34,081 --> 01:20:35,521
Georgia,
I've got to listen.

1408
01:20:35,601 --> 01:20:36,641
That's my business
from now on.

1409
01:20:36,721 --> 01:20:37,841
Listening for
the truth.

1410
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:39,321
Why don't you
come out to the house?

1411
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:40,921
I know Mike would
love to see you.

1412
01:20:41,001 --> 01:20:42,441
I've been meaning
to call. Only...

1413
01:20:42,481 --> 01:20:43,841
that's all
been forgotten.

1414
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,921
Good! I'd love to talk to Mike.

1415
01:20:45,961 --> 01:20:47,561
You see, he's part
of my campaign.

1416
01:20:47,641 --> 01:20:49,121
Oh?

1417
01:20:49,161 --> 01:20:50,601
What have I been
telling you?

1418
01:20:50,641 --> 01:20:53,601
What do you think Beck's doing
in that buggy with mrs. Mccomb?

1419
01:20:53,681 --> 01:20:55,801
Come on.
Get wise to yourselves.

1420
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:57,441
Take a look at this.

1421
01:20:57,481 --> 01:20:59,281
The silver queen herself.

1422
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,881
Let's have three cheers for
Beck and the silver queen.

1423
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:03,642
The former
mrs. Moore!

1424
01:21:05,202 --> 01:21:06,322
Shut up,
you idiot!

1425
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:07,442
What's the matter,
Beck?

1426
01:21:07,482 --> 01:21:08,882
You know
all about it.

1427
01:21:08,922 --> 01:21:10,922
Everybody knows about it except
stanley Moore, and he's dead.

1428
01:21:10,962 --> 01:21:13,922
King david killed him.
King david McComb!

1429
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:15,442
Get out of my way.

1430
01:21:15,522 --> 01:21:17,162
Ha ha ha ha!

1431
01:21:25,122 --> 01:21:27,042
The prodigal returns.

1432
01:21:27,122 --> 01:21:28,162
Plato.

1433
01:21:29,722 --> 01:21:30,962
I'm glad to see you.

1434
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:33,082
I knew you'd come back sooner or later,

1435
01:21:33,122 --> 01:21:34,762
you old reprobate. Here,
let me have your hat.

1436
01:21:34,842 --> 01:21:36,322
Georgia, let's get him a drink.

1437
01:21:36,402 --> 01:21:37,362
No, thanks.

1438
01:21:37,402 --> 01:21:38,842
Remember when
i told you once, Mike,

1439
01:21:38,922 --> 01:21:41,802
a man should have roots?
Well...

1440
01:21:41,842 --> 01:21:43,242
mine are here.

1441
01:21:43,282 --> 01:21:44,682
Yes, but...

1442
01:21:44,722 --> 01:21:46,242
the town's not
the same, Plato.

1443
01:21:46,322 --> 01:21:47,922
Towns should never
stay the same, Mike.

1444
01:21:48,002 --> 01:21:49,482
They should change,
get better.

1445
01:21:49,522 --> 01:21:51,922
This one can,
with your help.

1446
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,842
Same old Beck.

1447
01:21:54,922 --> 01:21:57,083
Except, uh, I never
heard you preach sober.

1448
01:21:57,123 --> 01:21:58,243
I'm not preaching,
Mike.

1449
01:21:58,323 --> 01:22:01,043
I'm running for senator.

1450
01:22:01,123 --> 01:22:02,043
Senator?

1451
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,323
Well, well.

1452
01:22:04,403 --> 01:22:06,923
Senator Beck, eh?

1453
01:22:07,003 --> 01:22:08,923
Well, what's your
platform gonna be?

1454
01:22:08,963 --> 01:22:10,323
The decline and fall of
the roman empire or what?

1455
01:22:10,363 --> 01:22:12,963
No. The decline and fall
of the silver empire.

1456
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:16,523
As a matter of fact, Mike,
I've been talking about you.

1457
01:22:16,563 --> 01:22:17,603
Have you?

1458
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:19,763
Thanks for the boost.

1459
01:22:19,843 --> 01:22:21,563
I'm not sure you'll
like what I'm saying.

1460
01:22:21,643 --> 01:22:24,803
I'm not so sure either.

1461
01:22:24,843 --> 01:22:26,923
You've gone over to the
western combine, haven't you?

1462
01:22:26,963 --> 01:22:28,963
No.

1463
01:22:29,043 --> 01:22:30,243
You've got it
all wrong, Mike.

1464
01:22:30,283 --> 01:22:32,283
It's the people.

1465
01:22:32,323 --> 01:22:34,363
The people against the
western combine, too.

1466
01:22:36,043 --> 01:22:38,363
Funny thing about voters.

1467
01:22:38,403 --> 01:22:41,483
They don't like to be
caught in a private war.

1468
01:22:41,563 --> 01:22:43,043
Yours or anybody else's.

1469
01:22:43,123 --> 01:22:44,603
Aw, you make
me sick.

1470
01:22:44,683 --> 01:22:46,083
Senator Beck, huh?

1471
01:22:48,164 --> 01:22:51,324
Georgia, I seem to remember
dragging the senator

1472
01:22:51,404 --> 01:22:53,164
out of a gutter once.

1473
01:22:53,204 --> 01:22:55,124
Or was it
a bar room floor?

1474
01:22:55,204 --> 01:22:56,724
Buying him his whiskey,

1475
01:22:56,804 --> 01:22:59,524
putting a clean shirt on his
back when he didn't even have one.

1476
01:22:59,604 --> 01:23:02,884
And now he's come to
pass judgment on us.

1477
01:23:02,924 --> 01:23:04,964
Look, Beck, you go back
and tell your voters this.

1478
01:23:05,004 --> 01:23:06,844
I made silver city
and I can break it.

1479
01:23:06,884 --> 01:23:08,364
Sooner or later, you
and all the rest of them

1480
01:23:08,444 --> 01:23:10,084
will come crying to me
like a pack of dogs.

1481
01:23:10,164 --> 01:23:11,444
I'm sorry, Mike.

1482
01:23:11,484 --> 01:23:12,644
Eh, you're always sorry.

1483
01:23:12,724 --> 01:23:14,364
I'm sorry for you
this time.

1484
01:23:14,444 --> 01:23:16,724
I'm going to win
this fight.

1485
01:23:16,804 --> 01:23:18,964
And when I do,
I'll wipe you

1486
01:23:19,004 --> 01:23:20,964
and the western combine
off the map.

1487
01:23:21,044 --> 01:23:22,324
This country
has a chance to grow,

1488
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:23,724
and I'm going to see
that it gets that chance.

1489
01:23:25,524 --> 01:23:28,844
Beck, you're still a
sanctimonious old hypocrite.

1490
01:23:33,124 --> 01:23:34,764
Good-bye, Georgia.

1491
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:37,884
If you need me,
you'll find me in town.

1492
01:23:37,924 --> 01:23:39,164
I'll see you
to the door.

1493
01:24:02,925 --> 01:24:06,045
Georgia.

1494
01:24:54,646 --> 01:24:56,086
What's the matter
with you?

1495
01:24:56,126 --> 01:24:58,606
Plato said he was
sorry for you.

1496
01:24:58,686 --> 01:25:00,606
I'm sorry
for both of us.

1497
01:25:02,526 --> 01:25:04,246
That needs
a little clearing up.

1498
01:25:04,326 --> 01:25:06,126
Like most of
Plato's parables,

1499
01:25:06,206 --> 01:25:07,046
it doesn't seem
to make much sense.

1500
01:25:07,086 --> 01:25:09,006
He was right, Mike.

1501
01:25:09,086 --> 01:25:10,886
In town, the people are desperate.

1502
01:25:10,966 --> 01:25:12,166
It's like
a graveyard.

1503
01:25:12,206 --> 01:25:14,126
Then I hope
they rest in peace.

1504
01:25:14,206 --> 01:25:15,446
That's their funeral.

1505
01:25:16,646 --> 01:25:18,206
You can't mean that.

1506
01:25:18,246 --> 01:25:19,446
But I do mean it.

1507
01:25:19,486 --> 01:25:20,766
I've got to mean it.

1508
01:25:20,806 --> 01:25:22,886
Even if you
don't like it.

1509
01:25:22,966 --> 01:25:25,286
You almost sound as if-as
if you want me to quit

1510
01:25:25,366 --> 01:25:27,047
in the middle
of a fight.

1511
01:25:27,127 --> 01:25:30,407
I don't want you
to fight me.

1512
01:25:30,487 --> 01:25:32,367
But Georgia,
you're my wife.

1513
01:25:32,407 --> 01:25:33,767
Yes.

1514
01:25:33,807 --> 01:25:35,727
But I think
you've forgotten.

1515
01:25:35,767 --> 01:25:37,167
I'm a fighter, too.

1516
01:25:39,727 --> 01:25:42,047
You don't even understand
what I'm trying to say, do you?

1517
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:45,767
I think I do.

1518
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,767
It seems to me that-

1519
01:25:47,807 --> 01:25:49,287
the babblings
of a reformed drunk

1520
01:25:49,367 --> 01:25:52,647
have turned even you
against me.

1521
01:25:52,727 --> 01:25:54,167
That drunk was
your friend once.

1522
01:25:54,247 --> 01:25:56,407
Friend?

1523
01:25:56,487 --> 01:25:58,647
I expect nothing
from friends.

1524
01:25:58,687 --> 01:26:01,847
But I did think I could count
on the loyalty of my wife.

1525
01:26:01,927 --> 01:26:04,927
I was reminded,
you took another man's.

1526
01:26:05,007 --> 01:26:07,647
Ah.

1527
01:26:07,727 --> 01:26:09,327
Now we're getting to it.

1528
01:26:09,407 --> 01:26:10,447
Beck told you.

1529
01:26:10,527 --> 01:26:13,127
I didn't hear it
from Beck.

1530
01:26:13,207 --> 01:26:14,647
Banjo sweeney
was in town.

1531
01:26:14,727 --> 01:26:16,647
Sweeney.

1532
01:26:16,687 --> 01:26:19,727
I never wanted to blame
you for stanley's death.

1533
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:23,848
I wanted to believe you did
everything you could to stop him.

1534
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:25,288
I knew what
people were saying.

1535
01:26:25,368 --> 01:26:27,928
But I loved you, so I believed in you.

1536
01:26:28,008 --> 01:26:29,288
Now you don't.
Is that it?

1537
01:26:32,368 --> 01:26:34,448
I thought
you changed, Mike,

1538
01:26:34,528 --> 01:26:36,928
but you haven't.

1539
01:26:37,008 --> 01:26:38,008
Change?

1540
01:26:39,288 --> 01:26:40,448
Why should I change?

1541
01:26:42,408 --> 01:26:44,808
I never pretended to be anything
different than what I am.

1542
01:26:44,888 --> 01:26:46,528
And you always knew
what I was after.

1543
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:48,848
But I didn't know how
you intended getting it.

1544
01:26:51,368 --> 01:26:54,128
Mike, call off
this fight. Please.

1545
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,608
Let's start again.

1546
01:26:55,648 --> 01:26:58,488
Call it off. I'll never
call it off, Georgia. Never.

1547
01:27:00,808 --> 01:27:02,088
Then I can't
stay and watch it.

1548
01:27:02,168 --> 01:27:03,288
I'm leaving you.

1549
01:27:40,529 --> 01:27:41,889
You seen
banjo sweeney?

1550
01:27:41,969 --> 01:27:43,249
No, I ain't.

1551
01:27:50,129 --> 01:27:51,169
Where's sweeney?

1552
01:27:51,209 --> 01:27:52,649
He's not here.

1553
01:27:52,729 --> 01:27:53,929
He's gone to
san francisco.

1554
01:27:53,969 --> 01:27:54,929
Liar.

1555
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:32,450
I tried to tell you
there's a run on the bank.

1556
01:28:32,530 --> 01:28:33,490
We're through.

1557
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:34,890
What are you
talking about?

1558
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:36,410
Get carson city.

1559
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:37,930
Tell them to send us a couple
of hundred thousand dollars.

1560
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:39,530
There isn't any bank
at carson city.

1561
01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:41,370
It didn't open today,
mr. Mccomb.

1562
01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:42,290
Then get leadville.

1563
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:43,650
It's closed, too.

1564
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:50,690
Get outta here. Get out
or I'll blow you out.

1565
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:51,930
Put up that gun,
pistol.

1566
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:55,810
Shaeffer, pay off
all those people.

1567
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:58,050
But mr. Mccomb, I'm not sure
we have enough money to...

1568
01:28:58,090 --> 01:28:59,971
if you do,
you're bankrupt!

1569
01:29:00,011 --> 01:29:01,491
Pay them off.

1570
01:29:01,571 --> 01:29:02,851
Give them
everything we got.

1571
01:29:05,651 --> 01:29:08,091
Quiet down.
You'll get your money.

1572
01:29:08,171 --> 01:29:10,651
Quiet down, everybody.

1573
01:29:58,412 --> 01:29:59,332
Georgia?

1574
01:30:32,732 --> 01:30:34,132
Get your hands off that.

1575
01:30:34,212 --> 01:30:35,972
Everything goes,
McComb.

1576
01:30:36,052 --> 01:30:37,532
That picture stays,

1577
01:30:37,572 --> 01:30:38,852
unless you want to
go out of here feet first.

1578
01:30:38,932 --> 01:30:42,012
Come on, jim, terry.
Let's get this other stuff.

1579
01:30:53,973 --> 01:30:57,173
They sure cleaned the place
out, didn't they, Mike?

1580
01:30:57,213 --> 01:30:59,253
Sure did.

1581
01:30:59,333 --> 01:31:02,333
I like it that way.
More room.

1582
01:31:03,653 --> 01:31:05,813
Look, Mike,
i haven't got big money,

1583
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:07,653
but I got a few dollars. It's yours.

1584
01:31:13,053 --> 01:31:14,413
I was just thinking
of the time

1585
01:31:14,493 --> 01:31:17,253
we burned a million
dollars, remember?

1586
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:18,533
I sure do.

1587
01:31:21,213 --> 01:31:23,213
Seen a lot of changes
since then, haven't we?

1588
01:31:23,253 --> 01:31:24,533
Yeah.

1589
01:31:24,613 --> 01:31:26,573
You know, chevigee and
the boys are back in town.

1590
01:31:26,613 --> 01:31:29,053
They're running some
windbag against Beck.

1591
01:31:29,133 --> 01:31:31,293
Really?
Very interesting.

1592
01:31:31,373 --> 01:31:32,653
You didn't come here to
talk politics, though.

1593
01:31:32,733 --> 01:31:34,053
What's on your mind,
boy?

1594
01:31:34,093 --> 01:31:35,373
Oh, nothing.

1595
01:31:37,133 --> 01:31:40,654
I just thought you'd like
to know I saw Georgia.

1596
01:31:40,734 --> 01:31:42,694
You know, Beck is
making a speech today

1597
01:31:42,774 --> 01:31:44,174
at the
silver river mine.

1598
01:31:44,254 --> 01:31:46,054
Georgia's working
with him.

1599
01:31:46,094 --> 01:31:48,254
Is she?

1600
01:31:48,334 --> 01:31:49,374
She, uh-she looks
well, I hope.

1601
01:31:49,454 --> 01:31:50,654
She looks great.

1602
01:31:50,734 --> 01:31:51,854
Good.

1603
01:31:51,934 --> 01:31:54,054
She's gonna be on hand
today for the big rally.

1604
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:56,174
Why don't you
come out, Mike?

1605
01:31:56,214 --> 01:31:57,734
I don't know.

1606
01:31:57,814 --> 01:31:59,974
I'm not interested
in politics.

1607
01:32:00,054 --> 01:32:01,894
I thought you'd
like to know.

1608
01:32:01,974 --> 01:32:03,334
Well, I guess
I'd better be going.

1609
01:32:07,214 --> 01:32:09,614
Look, Mike, why don't
you two get together?

1610
01:32:09,694 --> 01:32:12,294
Maybe you can straighten this thing out.

1611
01:32:12,374 --> 01:32:13,814
Of course, it's none of my business.

1612
01:32:13,894 --> 01:32:15,774
That's right.

1613
01:32:15,814 --> 01:32:17,094
It's none of
your business.

1614
01:32:55,375 --> 01:32:58,615
Our opposition just passed by-
John Plato Beck.

1615
01:32:58,695 --> 01:33:00,375
And mrs. Mccomb was with him.

1616
01:33:00,455 --> 01:33:01,775
What's she doing
with Beck?

1617
01:33:01,815 --> 01:33:03,095
Maybe McComb
is in this.

1618
01:33:03,175 --> 01:33:05,535
You don't have to worry about
McComb. He's washed up.

1619
01:33:05,615 --> 01:33:06,975
Mr. Sweeney's
right, gentlemen.

1620
01:33:07,055 --> 01:33:08,855
The only person we have
to worry about is Beck.

1621
01:33:08,935 --> 01:33:11,175
The voters know where
to place their confidence,

1622
01:33:11,215 --> 01:33:13,695
and that's in
everest t. Walker.

1623
01:33:13,775 --> 01:33:16,615
Well, if want to get back into the
silver business, you'd better be right.

1624
01:33:16,695 --> 01:33:18,535
The president's commission
will certainly take

1625
01:33:18,615 --> 01:33:20,375
the recommendation
of our new senator.

1626
01:33:20,455 --> 01:33:21,655
Naturally.

1627
01:33:21,735 --> 01:33:24,176
I think you fellas are
just making a lot of talk.

1628
01:33:24,256 --> 01:33:26,256
Plato Beck
hasn't got a chance.

1629
01:33:26,336 --> 01:33:28,616
You're sure of that,
mr. Sweeney?

1630
01:33:28,696 --> 01:33:32,456
A sure as shootin',
mr. Chevigee.

1631
01:33:32,536 --> 01:33:33,416
Understand?

1632
01:33:35,656 --> 01:33:37,896
You can take my word for it.

1633
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:41,416
I see some very fine
old bourbon...

1634
01:34:05,096 --> 01:34:08,616
ladies and gentlemen.

1635
01:34:08,696 --> 01:34:13,776
I am winding up my campaign
at silver river

1636
01:34:13,856 --> 01:34:16,576
because it's here
that the nation looks

1637
01:34:16,657 --> 01:34:18,377
for economic support.

1638
01:34:20,257 --> 01:34:23,457
We have pledged ourselves
to the government,

1639
01:34:23,497 --> 01:34:28,537
but there are those among us who
have broken that pledge.

1640
01:34:28,577 --> 01:34:34,977
And it is our responsibility
to expose them.

1641
01:34:35,057 --> 01:34:38,977
I propose to call them by name-

1642
01:34:43,537 --> 01:34:44,817
all right, boys,
break it up.

1643
01:34:44,897 --> 01:34:45,657
Keep your places!

1644
01:34:45,737 --> 01:34:47,137
Shut up.

1645
01:34:47,217 --> 01:34:50,257
We're going right on with
this meeting. Shut up, Beck.

1646
01:34:50,337 --> 01:34:53,897
These men are here
to intimidate us!

1647
01:35:21,138 --> 01:35:23,378
Michael, let me walk. I-

1648
01:35:27,858 --> 01:35:29,458
doctor. Quick.

1649
01:35:32,778 --> 01:35:35,098
They didn't want me
to talk either.

1650
01:35:35,138 --> 01:35:37,938
I had important
things to say, Mike,

1651
01:35:38,018 --> 01:35:40,778
and I wanted to make
my peace with you.

1652
01:35:43,538 --> 01:35:45,018
Funny thing, Mike...

1653
01:35:48,058 --> 01:35:50,658
my speech was going
to be about you.

1654
01:35:50,738 --> 01:35:51,538
Georgia...

1655
01:35:53,858 --> 01:35:56,858
you tell him. You know
what I want to say.

1656
01:36:23,939 --> 01:36:26,659
I'll tell you what he told me.

1657
01:36:26,699 --> 01:36:29,819
In every age, every country,

1658
01:36:29,899 --> 01:36:32,139
a few leaders are born.

1659
01:36:32,179 --> 01:36:36,259
Not many. Just enough
to keep things going.

1660
01:36:36,339 --> 01:36:39,219
You were that kind of man, Mike.

1661
01:36:39,299 --> 01:36:42,459
He'd always hoped
you'd find out.

1662
01:36:42,499 --> 01:36:44,939
But you built an empire
just for yourself,

1663
01:36:45,019 --> 01:36:47,539
and then you destroyed it.

1664
01:36:47,579 --> 01:36:50,259
Plato was trying to
pick up the pieces,

1665
01:36:50,339 --> 01:36:51,539
fit them together again.

1666
01:36:53,619 --> 01:36:56,620
There's no one left
to do that now... but you.

1667
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:12,900
Plato Beck's dead.

1668
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:16,460
What are you going
to do about it?

1669
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,740
What are you going to
do about it, McComb?

1670
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:20,060
Speak his epitaph?

1671
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:22,900
No, I don't have any words
that would do him justice.

1672
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:25,580
I just keep thinking that
the men who killed him

1673
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,700
are celebrating right now
in silver city.

1674
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:29,580
But something's
got to be done.

1675
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:34,940
So who feels like doing it?

1676
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:36,860
We've lost everything
as it is.

1677
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:38,980
Now McComb wants to
take us into town

1678
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:41,460
and get our skin
full of lead.

1679
01:37:49,221 --> 01:37:50,941
So you're going to
let him go alone.

1680
01:37:50,981 --> 01:37:53,301
What a bunch of yellow-
bellied skunks you are.

1681
01:37:53,341 --> 01:37:55,061
Get in those wagons
and go with him!

1682
01:38:57,542 --> 01:38:59,582
Hanson, you take your men
in from the other side.

1683
01:38:59,662 --> 01:39:00,862
Cover every street
out of town.

1684
01:39:09,622 --> 01:39:12,902
Tear that sign down, take
it out of town and burn it.

1685
01:39:24,822 --> 01:39:26,942
All right, you men disperse.
Come in from the east.

1686
01:39:48,623 --> 01:39:49,903
Mccomb's coming into town

1687
01:39:49,983 --> 01:39:52,743
and he's got all
his miners with him.

1688
01:39:52,823 --> 01:39:54,783
Get on your horses and
let's get out of here.

1689
01:42:03,985 --> 01:42:05,185
Get the ropes, boys.

1690
01:42:05,265 --> 01:42:09,905
Lynch him! Lynch him!

1691
01:42:09,945 --> 01:42:12,185
String him up!

1692
01:42:16,866 --> 01:42:18,826
Hold it, men, hold it. Look.

1693
01:42:18,866 --> 01:42:21,146
I'd like to see him strung
up as much as you would,

1694
01:42:21,226 --> 01:42:23,066
but don't let's
have a lynching.

1695
01:42:23,146 --> 01:42:24,026
That's what we
came here for!

1696
01:42:25,586 --> 01:42:29,586
I know it. Beck wanted to make
his speech today, didn't he?

1697
01:42:29,666 --> 01:42:31,226
He never finished it.

1698
01:42:31,306 --> 01:42:34,746
He wanted to tell you who was
responsible for most of your troubles.

1699
01:42:34,786 --> 01:42:36,746
I can tell you that. Me.

1700
01:42:36,826 --> 01:42:38,946
I can remember,
right in this town,

1701
01:42:39,026 --> 01:42:41,626
pledging to the president
of the united states himself

1702
01:42:41,666 --> 01:42:44,466
that we here in silver city would
keep the silver river flowing.

1703
01:42:44,506 --> 01:42:47,906
We didn't do it. But it's not
too late to make a new beginning.

1704
01:42:47,986 --> 01:42:50,786
First we'll open up the mines,
and this time we'll keep 'em open.

1705
01:42:50,866 --> 01:42:53,106
Pretty soon you're going to see
some important changes around here,

1706
01:42:53,146 --> 01:42:55,306
big changes.
These men are gonna get

1707
01:42:55,346 --> 01:42:56,946
what's coming to them,
i promise you,

1708
01:42:56,986 --> 01:42:58,786
but don't let's do it
by mob violence.

1709
01:42:58,826 --> 01:43:00,306
We've all had enough
of that, haven't we?

1710
01:43:00,386 --> 01:43:01,586
Let's open the mines!

1711
01:43:01,666 --> 01:43:03,946
We want to go back to work.

1712
01:43:05,946 --> 01:43:07,787
Take 'em and
lock 'em up.

1713
01:43:07,867 --> 01:43:09,387
We'll give 'em
a fair hearing.

1714
01:43:19,067 --> 01:43:20,547
I'm proud of you, Mike.

1715
01:43:22,267 --> 01:43:24,787
What's the matter?

1716
01:43:24,867 --> 01:43:27,067
I was just thinking what
a wonderful chance I had

1717
01:43:27,147 --> 01:43:28,787
to shoot banjo sweeney
in the back,

1718
01:43:28,827 --> 01:43:30,627
and I passed it up.

1719
01:43:32,787 --> 01:43:34,987
You haven't changed
a bit, Mike McComb.
