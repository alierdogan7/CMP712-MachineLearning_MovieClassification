- How does it look?
- Just as dead as when I left.

174
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:34,147
- You had a brother here?
- Half brother.

175
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:36,546
You can look him up and meet me later.

176
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:40,369
Haven't seen him for 10 years.
I can wait till I get a shave.

177
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:43,532
As head of the family I've got
to make a good impression.

178
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,721
How do you spell "inconsequential"?

179
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,255
How do you spell "inconsequential"?

180
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:08,140
Look it up for yourself
so you'll remember it.

181
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,372
You're not fooling me.
You don't know yourself.

182
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:14,049
I wish dad would use
shorter words in his editorials,

183
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:16,447
Or else learn how
to spell the long ones.

184
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:18,567
That's the beauty
of owning your own paper.

185
00:14:18,637 --> 00:14:21,382
Nobody can edit my copy.

186
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:24,023
You're not supposed to hear that.

187
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:28,334
I...N...

188
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:31,671
Hmm.

189
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:37,406
Alan!

190
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:40,360
Look, it's Jeff!

191
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:44,809
Jeff!

192
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:48,006
Jeff!

193
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:51,099
Jeff!

194
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:04,099
Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I didn't
mean to. I just got so excited.

195
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:06,184
That's all right. I'm afraid I don't...

196
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:08,721
Susan Mitchell. Don't you remember me?

197
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,919
No. Why, I can't believe it.

198
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:15,116
What do you expect me to do,
stay 13 all my life?

199
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:16,159
Hello, Jeff.

200
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:18,244
- Alan.
- Welcome home.

201
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:20,330
Say, you filled out.

202
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,624
Well, people change in 10 years.

203
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:24,813
You haven't. I knew you right away.

204
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:29,124
I had such a crush on you. I was
always trying to impress you.

205
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:31,487
Give me your coat.
I'll get the stain off.

206
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:34,685
There's plenty of time. I'm
going to be around for a while.

207
00:15:34,755 --> 00:15:36,805
Wonderful. Will you have
dinner with us tonight?

208
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:40,594
Soon as I get cleaned up.
See you later.

209
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:46,919
So you've still got a crush on him.

210
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,178
Don't be silly. That was kid stuff.

211
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,395
Good.

212
00:15:50,464 --> 00:15:52,481
That was quite a reception.

213
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:55,400
That was my brother
and a girl I used to know.

214
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:56,825
Used to?

215
00:15:56,894 --> 00:16:00,474
She was 13 when I left.
Wore pigtails down to here.

216
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,525
She doesn't anymore.

217
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,959
I'm not asking anybody
to put up any money.

218
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,567
I just wanted you to know
what was going on.

219
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:18,687
In other words, you hope we like it,

220
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:21,815
Whether we like it or not. Is that it?

221
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:24,630
- Not exactly, Zeke.
- That's what it sounds like.

222
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,890
In the first place
it doesn't affect you.

223
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,844
You wanted to get the story
firsthand for your paper.

224
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:32,242
Anything that happens to this
town, that's my business.

225
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:34,328
Afraid you're all ahead of me.

226
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:36,413
- Hello, Davis.
- Hello, big guy.

227
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:39,054
Sorry I'm late.
Got held up at the mine.

228
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,210
What's this all about?

229
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,816
I'm going to put in a railroad
to Virginia city.

230
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:46,284
I was just telling him I'm against it.

231
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,370
I'm tired of these
so-called champagne bandits.

232
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:52,088
I want my gold to go through,
I'm going to see that it does.

233
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:55,703
Perhaps if you increased
the reward money.

234
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:58,380
I personally offered to put up $5,000.

235
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:01,091
That didn't do it.
This is the only solution.

236
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,558
I'm surprised you aren't
in favor of it.

237
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:06,826
- It'll bring in more people.
- What kind of people?

238
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:09,084
Roughnecks, thugs, claim jumpers.

239
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:11,344
That doesn't necessarily follow.

240
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:14,020
We have a peaceful town.
Should be kept that way.

241
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:16,766
Open it up, and you'll
have another dodge city,

242
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:20,694
Where a decent woman can't
step outdoors after sundown.

243
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:22,779
Is that what you want
for your families?

244
00:17:22,848 --> 00:17:24,933
That's a pretty one-sided picture.

245
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,123
What happens to my stagecoach lines?

246
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:29,209
We can't stop the clock, Henry.

247
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:31,434
The railroad is faster and safer.

248
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:34,109
My bank has an investment to protect.

249
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:36,439
I have a contract with Henry dodson.

250
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:40,227
I intend to honor it,
railroad or no railroad.

251
00:17:42,242 --> 00:17:45,615
And my paper's going to
fight against it.

252
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:48,013
I think you're making a mistake.

253
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:51,175
- We'll see.
- I'm with you.

254
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:57,432
Afraid I'll have to stay
with my friends.

255
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,522
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

256
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:08,867
Now if the rest of you will stay,

257
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:10,917
I'll go into more detail.

258
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,915
Thanks, John. I won't forget this.

259
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:17,000
What are friends for?

260
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:19,086
Sharon's not in San Francisco now.

261
00:18:19,154 --> 00:18:21,484
He'll find out I swing
some weight here, too.

262
00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:23,812
- Thanks, Zeke.
- Anything I can do, Zeke?

263
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,462
Read the paper tomorrow.

264
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:30,590
If that deal goes through,
we'll be out of business.

265
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,745
- It won't.
- What are you going to do?

266
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:35,838
Never fight your own battles
when you get somebody else to.

267
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:39,487
Only thing that's going
to stop Sharon's a .45.

268
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:41,573
He's got a long way to go.

269
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:44,945
Must be a fascinating life...
New places, new people.

270
00:18:45,014 --> 00:18:47,099
Always something different
around the corner.

271
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:50,506
You make it sound a lot better
than it seems at the time.

272
00:18:50,575 --> 00:18:53,112
You must enjoy it,
or you wouldn't do it.

273
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:55,719
Maybe he just hasn't
found anything better.

274
00:18:55,789 --> 00:19:00,064
I guess that's about it.
Well, I must be going.

275
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:02,948
Dad will be sorry he missed you.

276
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,034
Give him my best.

277
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,989
I'm sorry, Jeff.
Didn't come out very well.

278
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:09,621
Oh, forget it.

279
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:13,549
It'll get a lot dirtier
before I'm through.

280
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,913
- Mr. Mitchell.
- Jeff.

281
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:18,763
- Glad to see you.
- Wish I could say the same.

282
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,883
- Dad?
- Nothing personal.

283
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,004
I just don't like what you're here for.

284
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:25,089
What's wrong with it?

285
00:19:25,158 --> 00:19:27,174
Lots of things.

286
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:30,511
Susan, will you take this
downstairs and set it up?

287
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,639
"Proposed railroad threat
to Carson city."

288
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,725
Why is it a threat?

289
00:19:35,794 --> 00:19:39,721
This will be a different town
if you put a railroad in here.

290
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,807
It could stand a little waking up.

291
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:43,545
I like the way it is.

292
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:46,290
Growing pains are always
a little tough,

293
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,488
But you can't get
to be an adult without them.

294
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:52,373
Depends what you mean
by being an adult.

295
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,188
I don't judge a man just by his size.

296
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:57,969
You got a good point there,
Mr. Mitchell.

297
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,471
Good night, sir. Thanks for dinner.

298
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,557
Don't sound so formal.

299
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:05,233
I've got to get used
to you being grown-up.

300
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:07,666
Wait a minute. I'll walk down with you.

301
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:11,037
Good night, Susan.
Good night, Mr. Mitchell.

302
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:13,122
Zeke: Good night, Alan.

303
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:17,467
I don't think that was a very
nice way to greet him.

304
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:19,900
We're on different sides
of the fence, that's all.

305
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,986
- He understands.
- Well, I don't.

306
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,426
Look, it's late. You better
hurry up with that copy.

307
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,204
So you're a newspaper man now.

308
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,985
Yeah. Not much by your
standards, but I like it.

309
00:20:35,055 --> 00:20:37,105
That's what they pay off on.

310
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:40,581
I thought it might be hard for
you to understand how a man.

311
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,014
Could be satisfied
to stay in one place.

312
00:20:43,084 --> 00:20:46,489
You wanted to see what was on
the other side of the Mountain.

313
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,540
Both sides are pretty much alike.

314
00:20:50,278 --> 00:20:52,260
The way I figure it,

315
00:20:52,328 --> 00:20:54,345
You got everything you want right here.

316
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:56,778
Not much sense looking anywhere else.

317
00:20:56,847 --> 00:20:59,176
Of course, it doesn't make a man out.

318
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:01,574
To be a very dashing figure.

319
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:03,972
You're on the right track,
kid. Stay on it.

320
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:06,475
- I intent to.
- Remember, I'm on your side.

321
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,734
Come on in. I'll buy you a drink.

322
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:12,001
No, thanks. Glad to have
you back, Jeff. Goodnight.

323
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,183
Good night.

324
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:18,292
Maybe you can go
with dodson, but I can't.

325
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,586
If the railroad guarantees
delivery at cheaper rates,

326
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,011
I have to go along.

327
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,062
- Beer.
- Right.

328
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,149
"Champagne bandits."

329
00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:38,243
Pretty fancy title
for a bunch of holdup men.

330
00:21:38,312 --> 00:21:40,606
From what I hear, they're
a pretty fancy bunch.

331
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:52,180
You the fellow that came
to town with Sharon?

332
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,571
Yes.

333
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,099
My name's Davis.

334
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:57,429
At our mine owners meeting just now,

335
00:21:57,498 --> 00:22:00,174
Sharon's been telling us
about this railroad idea.

336
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:02,260
Glad to know you. I'm Jeff Kincaid.

337
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,735
This is Dave Fairchild,
Ben Roberts, and Jim squires.

338
00:22:05,805 --> 00:22:07,821
I understand you're the engineer.

339
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,037
That's right.

340
00:22:09,107 --> 00:22:11,193
You really think
you can put it through?

341
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:13,382
I don't see anything that can stop us.

342
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:15,502
What about the terrain?
It's pretty rugged country.

343
00:22:15,572 --> 00:22:18,456
That's what makes it interesting.

344
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:20,542
Are you against it, too?

345
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:22,801
Might say for ethical reasons.

346
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:25,025
I have a contract
with the stagecoach line.

347
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:29,196
The owner's a friend. Nothing
in the book against my buying.

348
00:22:29,336 --> 00:22:31,281
A drink for the opposition, though.

349
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:34,201
Thanks, but Sharon's waiting
for me. We've some work to do.

350
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:36,878
Don't you go tell him
I tried to bribe you.

351
00:22:36,948 --> 00:22:39,276
No, but I'll keep it in mind.
Goodnight, gentlemen.

352
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:42,751
Nice fellow. We better be going.

353
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:48,105
It would make it easier for me
if you learned how to smile.

354
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:50,190
You do the smiling.

355

like this is your idea.

work, but it always does.

We've never run up against
guys like this before.

372
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:19,366
I guess so. I just didn't expect
so violent a greeting.

374

375

First time I see you,
I ruin your jacket,

376
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:29,272
And then a whole Mountain
blows up on me.

377

- What's the matter?
- My ankle.

around my shoulder.

Looking for news.

382
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:53,603
You nearly made some.

383
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:55,688
I might as well confess.

384
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:58,086
I didn't come out here
looking for a story.

385
00:25:58,155 --> 00:26:00,762
I came to find out why
you've been avoiding me.

386
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,847
Got the feeling
your father didn't exactly.

387
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:04,933
Have the welcome mat out for me.

388
00:26:05,003 --> 00:26:06,879

389

You don't work at night.

391
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:13,866
I thought your evenings
would be taken up.

392
00:26:13,935 --> 00:26:16,924
With Alan? We're good friends.
We've grown up together...

393
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,426
Do all your good friends
kiss you good night?

394
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:25,092
Why, that was just a peck
on the cheek, like this.

395
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:27,559
You don't call that
a real kiss, do you?

396
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:31,592
- Or do you?
- I stumbled.

397
00:26:32,496 --> 00:26:34,685
Ah, here comes the wagon.

398

- There won't be any next time.

a half-inch shorter,
