1
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:45,578
Well, there's young Cantrell.
Let's go, he's a day late.

2
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:47,521
All right.

3
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,756
Ah, Dickinson. Hold that a minute,
will you? Don't drop it.

4
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:55,355
That's my whole case in there.
Evidence, affidavits, everything.

5
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,495
Try dressing on the front seat at a gallop.

6
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:01,969
- How do I look?
- That's how you look.

7
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:06,173
- Turn around. I expected you yesterday.
- I know.

8
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:08,675
- Any luck at the Jorgenson ranch?
- No, not yet.

9
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,474
Hightower, take the rest of this gear to
adjutant's quarters, will you?

10
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,539
Yes, sir.

11
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:18,080
- How much time we got?
- None. Come on.

12
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:20,222
- All my buttons buttoned?
- Yes.

13
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:23,186
Officers' wives?

14
00:02:28,998 --> 00:02:31,523
Oh, they're not gonna let
the women sit in on this, are they?

15
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:35,059
Spicy case like yours, try and keep
them out, they'd have your scalp.

16
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:36,901
Trying to make it into a Roman circus.

17
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:38,907
Tom, they want to see a hanging.

18
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:41,842
President of the court-martial
is Colonel Otis Thornton Fosgate...

19
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:46,211
I know, I know all about it.
I know Old Stone Face.

20
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,248
Tom, I admire you
for defending Rutledge, but

21
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,585
you might as well know,
I think he's as guilty as hell.

22
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,654
Well, you might as well know, I don't.

23
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:32,153
Is Mary Beecher here?

24
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:34,886
Not too friendly.

25
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,531
I'm not calling her as a friend,
I'm calling her as a witness.

26
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:41,267
Good luck, Tom.

27
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,794
Mary, I know this is gonna be
an ordeal for you,

28
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:12,028
but I had to call on you. Rutledge
needs all the help that he can get.

29
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:13,295
And whose fault is that?

30
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,494
What is done is done.

31
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:18,267
We're in the hands of the court now,
and whatever you feel about...

32
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,740
But you're defending him.

33
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,542
You. You of all men.

34
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:24,477
Well, if you had some knowledge
of the facts...

35
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:25,536
Ten-hut!

36
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,388
Silence. Silence! Quiet!

37
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:49,871
You civilians, get those hats off!
Put out those cigars!

38
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:53,699
Sergeant, see that they do,
and if they don't, throw them out!

39
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:54,765
Yes, sir.

40
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:03,609
Otis isn't feeling very well this morning.

41
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:07,144
- He had a little glass of wine last night.
- Yes.

42
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:12,294
I want something understood
right here and now!

43
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:17,665
This is a court-martial!
It is not a quilting bee.

44
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:19,935
It's not a quilting bee.

45
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:27,075
Now, if there is any further disturbance,
or undue chatter,

46
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,679
I am gonna clear this court at once!

47
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,477
Cordelia, your husband
wouldn't put us out, would he?

48
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:36,746
He wouldn't dare. Just let him try.

49
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:42,348
- Court is ready, sir.
- Very good, Captain.

50
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,896
Now, I have been told that counsel
for the defense is not in the post.

51
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:51,024
- Well, if that's true...
- Lieutenant Cantrell is present, sir.

52
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:55,132
My apologies if my last-minute arrival
has inconvenienced the court.

53
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,030
Very good, Cantrell.

54
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,510
Now, is trial judge advocate ready
to prosecute this case?

55
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:06,807
Captain Shattuck, sir.
I'm ready for the prosecution.

56
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,009
Oh, yes. Yeah.

57
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:14,146
You're the officer sent down from General
Nelson Miles' headquarters, aren't you?

58
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,885
I see, you wear the 14th Infantry insignia.

59
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,790
I've been away from the regiment, sir,

60
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:21,955
detailed to the Judge Advocate-General's
department for 10 years.

61
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:26,159
Oh, yes. Lawyer, eh? Lawyer.

62
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:30,999
Sent down here to keep a staff eye
on field soldier justice, is that it?

63
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:34,510
On the contrary, sir,
justice was guaranteed the accused

64
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:37,011
when you were detailed
as president of this court.

65
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:45,376
Now, counsel being ready and present,

66
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:49,249
this general court appointed by
departmental special order 104 under

67
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:53,591
date 8th August, 1881, is now in session.

68
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,258
All right, Sergeant. The accused,
Sergeant Rutledge, will be brought in.

69
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,698
Yes, sir.

70
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:38,473
First Sergeant Braxton Rutledge, C Troop,
9th United States Cavalry.

71
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:42,237
Hang him from the rafters! Hang him high!

72
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:45,704
Quiet! Quiet!

73
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:51,677
- Mr. President?
- Order.

74
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:56,248
Mr. President, I request this courtroom
be cleared of all spectators.

75
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,560
This is not a public show.

76
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:02,996
A soldier is on trial
for his life before this court.

77
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:05,329
And furthermore,
by the very nature of the charges alone,

78
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,096
this is certainly no place for ladies.

79
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:12,737
Request granted. Dickinson.

80
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:17,312
Clear this courtroom of everybody
not directly connected with this case!

81
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:18,973
Clear them!

82
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:26,454
Everybody.

83
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:36,426
Out.

84
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,801
Otis, Otis, tell this person
you don't mean me.

85
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,005
Out, Cordelia.

86
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,340
Captain Dickinson, escort Mrs. Fosgate
and her friends to the door.

87
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,847
Oh, really.

88
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,621
This is the most absurd thing
I've ever heard in my life.

89
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,585
Otis Fosgate, wait till I get you home
and really tell you what I think of you.

90
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:20,064
Now, gentlemen, I want counsel for both
sides to understand that this court-martial

91
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:24,641
is being held behind closed doors
with no prejudice toward the accused,

92
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:28,440
and solely because of
the scandalous nature of the charges

93
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:30,883
and to avoid offense to public decency.

94
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:34,646
- Mulqueen, read the charge sheet.
- Sir.

95
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:39,584
Since the court acknowledges
the unspeakable nature of the charges,

96
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:43,094
I would like to suggest that
out of deference to the young lady

97
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,531
whose presence is necessary as a witness,

98
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,934
that the court omit reading of the charges
and specifications in detail

99
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,201
and simply cite the accused as charged

100
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:57,235
with violation of the 92nd Article of War
on both counts.

101
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,080
Defense Counsel, any objections?

102
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,742
As long as the court is aware
of Captain Shattuck's sly attempt

103
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:06,015
to create prejudice, no objections.

104
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:12,827
The accused stands charged with violation
of the 92nd Article of War on both counts.

105
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,562
Sergeant Rutledge, how do you plead?

106
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:21,897
- Guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty to both charges, sir.

107
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,407
Not guilty?

108
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:33,545
Lieutenant Cantrell, is this prisoner's plea
made on advice of counsel?

109
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:37,882
Yes, sir. Not guilty on both charges
and not guilty on all specifications, sir.

110
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,489
All right, proceed, proceed.

111
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,690
All right, Captain Shattuck,
call your first witness.

112
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:52,460
- I call Miss Mary Beecher to the stand.
- Sir, I appeal to the court.

113
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:56,096
Captain Shattuck knows very well Miss
Beecher is here as witness for the defense.

114
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,332
Sir, I know of no rule

115
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,499
which says prosecution may not call
the defense witness

116
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,237
so long as it does not later
impeach her testimony.

117
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:03,835
Miss Beecher, please.

118
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,148
Do you swear the evidence you're about
to give is the truth, the whole truth,

119
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:16,157
and nothing but the truth,
so, help you God, ma'am?

120
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:17,817
- I do.
- Thank you, ma'am.

121
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,689
And now, Miss Beecher,
in your own words,

122
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,392
will you kindly acquaint the court
with all the circumstances

123
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:28,631
that lead up to your first meeting
with the accused, Sergeant Rutledge?

124
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:33,033
And everything that transpired thereafter?

125
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,011
Well, I... I was returning
to Arizona after an absence of

126
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,607
12 years in the East.

127
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,213
And when I arrived at Junction City,

128
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,017
I discovered that
there were no longer any passenger trains

129
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,456
running through to Spindle Station
into Fort Linton.

130
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,557
And through the friendship
of a conductor, Mr. Owens,

131
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,393
whom I'd known since I was a little girl,

132
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,229
I managed to get a ride in
the caboose of his freight train

133
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:02,193
and I was supposed to meet my father
at Spindle Station.

134
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:05,206
Mr. Owens had sent him a telegram
from Junction City.

135
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,342
And it was on the caboose
of that freight train that I

136
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:11,376
first met Lieutenant Cantrell.

137
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:32,800
He says the horses need water.

138
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:37,838
- You hear that, Owens?
- You think I'm deaf? Deaf and dumb?

139
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:41,132
You've been screaming
for water louder than them remounts

140
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,837
since we left Junction City.

141
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:45,913
How long before we get
to Spindle Station, Mr. Owens?

142
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,576
Well, the way I got it figured,

143
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:54,317
with the sand on the tracks
and the wind against us, I'd say,

144
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,615
half-hour at the outside. About midnight.

145
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,721
You hear that, Miss Beecher?

146
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:04,261
Half-hour, you'll get off at Spindle,
and I'll go on to Fort Linton.

147
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,728
You sound surprised, Lieutenant Cantrell.

148
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:10,829
What I've been trying to say is
that you're a very attractive, young and

149
00:13:10,906 --> 00:13:12,840
a rather mysterious lady,

150
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:17,238
and I'm a lonely bachelor in a lonely land.

151
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,844
Now, there's nothing mysterious
about me.

152
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:22,315
I'm just coming home after 12 years.

153
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:25,518
But somehow, it doesn't
seem like coming home at all.

154
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:30,351
I'd forgotten what a lonely land
Arizona territory really is.

155
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:33,025
Why did your father
send you back East, Mary?

156
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:35,791
Was it school or what?

157
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:39,323
No, it was promise he made
to my mother, just before she died.

158
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:44,728
I hated going. I loved Arizona then.
And now, I just don't know.

159
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:47,705
Don't you worry, Mary.

160
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:52,338
I sent your father that telegram
from Junction City like you told me, and

161
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:56,009
he'll be at Spindle Station to meet you
and mighty glad to see you, too.

162
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:57,846
Why, sure he will.

163
00:13:58,053 --> 00:14:01,716
You know, Arizona has changed
considerably since Geronimo was taken.

164
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:06,489
We haven't had any Apache trouble in,
oh, I don't know, two or three years.

165
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:09,057
Spindle Station coming up.

166
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,525
You and your dad-blame horses, Laredo.

167
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,762
You're running powerful late already.

168
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,870
If he had his way, Mary, he'd have me
throw you off the train without stopping.

169
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:22,975
If you're in such a all-fired hurry,
fetch out her other bag.

170
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:34,018
- Would you like some more hot coffee...
- No, thank you.

171
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,354
It's a pretty long, cold ride over there
to Spanish Wells.

172
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:39,724
I'll have to get used
to these Arizona distances.

173
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,060
Well, now, you know,
it's only about an hour on the train

174
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,032
from Fort Linton to Spindle, and then

175
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:49,169
from Spindle to Spanish Wells,
that's just a short day's ride.

176
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:53,868
- Well, that's still quite a distance.
- Not if there's a welcome at the end of it.

177
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:06,620
- My name's Tom.
- Goodbye, Tom.

178
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,819
There'll be a welcome for you.

179
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:11,489
Bye, Mary.

180
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,736
Oh, Nate. Nate Hedges.

181
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:30,540
Hey, Nate, wake up, Nate.
Nate, where are you?

182
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:33,980
He's around here someplace. I just...

183
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:38,712
Hey, Nate! Nate Hedges, wake up.

184
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,224
Hey, Nate!

185
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:46,216
Oh, Nate!

186
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,123
There ain't nobody here
to meet you, Mary.

187
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:51,597
I did send that telegram to your Dad,
you know.

188
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:54,966
Well, don't worry, Mr. Owens,
I'm sure he'll be along soon.

189
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,529
Well, Nate'll take care of you till he come.
You remember Nate Hedges, don't you?

190
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:01,235
- Why, Nate Hedges, is he still here?
- What's the trouble, Mary?

191
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,870
My father isn't here yet,
and I don't know what...

192
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:06,039
Excuse me, just a minute, Mary,
I think I'm gonna...

193
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:08,913
Nate. Busy, Nate?

194
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,418
Nate. Nate?

195
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:15,889
Busy?

196
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,827
Now, look here, Owens.

197
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,955
I got two carloads of valuable
remounts on that train.

198
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:25,830
You ain't gonna hold me up
for anymore of that hugging and kissing.

199
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,837
- Hold your horses, Laredo.
- That's just what I ain't gonna do.

200
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,099
Nate!

201
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:41,873
Hold it!

202
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,978
Hey, nobody starts that train but me!

203
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:52,422
Mary, you're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

204
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:55,986
- And don't forget I said it to you.
- Oh, hush. Hurry now.

205
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:28,161
Mr. Hedges?

206
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,101
Nate?

207
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:42,742
Nate?

208
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:57,355
Mr. Hedges.

209
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:04,893
Nate. Nate! Nate, wake up!

210
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:24,680
Don't scream, Miss. Don't scream.

211
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:37,365
It was... It was as though he'd
sprung up at me out of the earth.

212
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,628
I couldn't move, I couldn't scream.

213
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:42,328
It was like a nightmare.

214
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:44,429
And that man who sprang at you
from the darkness

215
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:47,236
like something from a nightmare,
is he here in this court?

216
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:49,277
- Oh, yes, but I...
- Is that man who seized you

217
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:52,609
so brutally and viciously,
is he here in this courtroom?

218
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:55,275
- Well, yes, he is sitting right there...
- Is it that man there,

219
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,477
- that colored soldier?
- I object.

220
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,754
I withdraw the word "colored."

221
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:06,352
I refer to the accused, Sergeant Rutledge.

222
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:09,158
Is he the man who seized you
so viciously, Miss Beecher?

223
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,200
- Yes, but, what I'm trying to tell you...
- That is all, Miss Beecher.

224
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,362
Your witness, Lieutenant Cantrell.

225
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,710
Sir, gentlemen.

226
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:27,239
A soldier's life is at stake,
and this man is playing cheap, legal tricks.

227
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,910
- I resent that, sir.
- That's enough!

228
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:34,514
I will have no personalities
between counsel.

229
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:38,284
Proceed, Lieutenant.

230
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:42,320
Prosecution has stolen
a key defense witness

231
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:47,331
and ruthlessly cut off the testimony at
a point highly unfavorable to the accused.

232
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:50,728
This is not the proper time
for Defense Counsel to argue the case.

233
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:53,798
He should either cross-examine
or dismiss the witness.

234
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:57,141
The manual for court-martial clearly
states, "The trial judge advocate

235
00:19:57,212 --> 00:19:59,544
"should do his utmost
to present the whole truth

236
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:04,380
"and to oppose every attempt
to suppress the facts or to distort them."

237
00:20:08,523 --> 00:20:10,889
Now, I ask the court not to accept

238
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,752
the half-truth that Captain Shattuck
has so slickly presented,

239
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:17,394
but to insist on the whole truth,

240
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,492
by letting Miss Beecher go on
with the story.

241
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:24,027
I object, sir. If this is not a
personal attack on me and my...

242
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:26,267
Sit down. Now, Miss Beecher, tell me.

243
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:30,200
- Is there more to your story?
- Yes. Yes, there is.

244
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,645
Well, I think I speak for
the other members of this court

245
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:33,976
when I say that I'd like to hear it.

246
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,147
Now, Miss Beecher,
as I recall the testimony

247
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,620
before Captain Shattuck cut you off,

248
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,526
Sergeant Rutledge was pressing
his hand over your mouth.

249
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:49,530
Now tell us, what happened then?

250
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:53,731
Well, he... He warned me.

251
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:57,102
He warned me not to scream again.

252
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,870
He said, "Don't scream again, Miss.

253
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,370
"Don't scream!"

254
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,450
You don't have to be afraid of me.

255
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:14,018
I'm First Sergeant Rutledge,
United States Cavalry.

256
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,218
Quiet, ma'am. I ain't gonna hurt you.

257
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,323
But I ain't gonna let you scream.

258
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:23,192
Now, you listen to me.

259
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,526
I've been blood trailed all the way
into Spindle by three Mescaleros.

260
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,767
They jumped me about a mile back,
got my horse.

261
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:35,804
I killed one.
The other two are out there somewheres.

262
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:39,475
Do you understand? Apaches.

263
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:56,960
Now, tell me, what did you find in there?

264
00:21:58,767 --> 00:21:59,859
He's dead.

265
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:02,130
- The old man, the stationmaster?
- Yes.

266
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:06,433
I just put my hand on his shoulder,
and he fell to the floor.

267
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:09,477
I was moving around awful fast.
One could've circled ahead of me, maybe.

268
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:11,535
Oh, you mean, while I was in there,
an Apache...

269
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:12,739
Stop it.

270
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,080
It's where they are now.

271
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:18,085
How did he fall, loose or how?

272
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:21,714
He was all limp and...

273
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:25,718
Less than one hour dead in this weather?
I don't know.

274
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,359
My father.

275
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,327
My father's coming here to meet me. If
the Apaches are out there, they'll kill him.

276
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,097
It ain't your father now. It's you and me.

277
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:38,564
You're a Western woman,
you can use a gun?

278
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,235
- Oh, yes, but...
- They'll have no mercy on you, lady.

279
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,968
They'll have no mercy.

280
00:22:56,358 --> 00:22:57,347
Look out!

281
00:23:20,615 --> 00:23:21,843
Do we have to go in there?

282
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:24,909
No, you stay here
while I police up the place.

283
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:15,028
- What were you doing out there?
- It's all right. You can come in now.

284
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,941
I took him outside. The best I could do.

285
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,239
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

286
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:06,982
Your father got word you were coming?

287
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:10,286
Yes. The conductor
telegraphed him from Junction City.

288
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:14,391
Name Beecher? Spanish Well Ranch?

289
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:17,598
You mean he didn't get it? Let me see.

290
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,462
Maybe a file copy.

291
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:24,297
A line rider could've taken it on out
to the ranch.

292
00:25:24,372 --> 00:25:25,703
Dad isn't here.

293
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:28,840
When you had the lamp out back,
you were reading sign.

294
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,003
- What is it?
- Apaches.

295
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,415
The ones that jumped us,
they didn't kill the old man.

296
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:39,419
- You mean it wasn't Apaches?
- It was Apaches, but an earlier party.

297
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,822
The signs out back showed
30 or 40 unshod ponies.

298
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:48,062
It must've been an awful big breakout
at San Rosario Reservation.

299
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,798
Our ranch is on San Rosario Road.

300
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:54,195
It's a good thing your father
didn't get the message.

301
00:25:54,536 --> 00:25:56,868
No time to be caught
out on the roads, Miss.

302
00:25:57,505 --> 00:26:01,737
However, you and I got
to get some rest and food.

303
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,710
I'll see if I can rustle us up something.

304
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:06,278
- No, let me do it.
- No, you stay!

305
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:11,843
I'm sorry, Miss.
I've been a First Sergeant too long.

306
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,915
What I meant to say is,
rest easy here till I come back.

307
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:25,856
Please continue, Miss Beecher.
Tell us what happened then.

308
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,431
Well, the storm seemed
to grow in violence.

309
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:34,968
The wind blew stronger and stronger.

310
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:39,043
I thought I heard a coyote howl.

311
00:26:40,815 --> 00:26:42,339
And I was afraid.

312
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:44,984
Terribly afraid.

313
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,527
I'm Mary Beecher.

314
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:57,664
- What did you say your name is?
- Rutledge. Braxton Rutledge.

315
00:26:58,066 --> 00:26:59,829
First Sergeant, 9th Cavalry.

316
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:04,131
I didn't know they had any colored...
I mean, are you from Fort Linton?

317
00:27:05,307 --> 00:27:08,572
The 9th Cavalry relieved
the white garrison a few years back.

318
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,612
- Then you must know Lieutenant Cantrell?
- Yes, I know him.

319
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:26,920
That Apache cut you out there.
Why didn't you tell me?

320
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:29,791
- I'm all right. You get out.
- I won't.

321
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:32,689
- There's whiskey up there.
- You want whiskey?

322
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,767
Up there on the shelf. Give it to me.

323
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,908
That isn't a knife cut.

324
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,415
Gunshot. Apaches didn't do it.

325
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,160
When did you leave Fort Linton?

326
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:03,589
- A while back.
- Yesterday?

327
00:28:04,532 --> 00:28:07,831
- I said, "A while back."
- Look, Sergeant.

328
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:11,495
I know you've got to sleep,
but suppose the Apaches come back?

329
00:28:12,073 --> 00:28:16,305
When Apaches kill and run,
chances are they don't come back.

330
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:19,143
I'll get you something to eat.

331
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,382
Please don't go to sleep.
It'll be hot in a minute.

332
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:27,077
You take yours in there in the next room.

333
00:28:27,155 --> 00:28:29,589
- I'll dish my own up.
- You stay where you are.

334
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:31,549
I'll get yours.

335
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:36,052
Anyone come,
you ain't gonna be in here with me.

336
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,559
- What're you talking about?
- I'm talking about you.

337
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:43,093
A white woman.

338
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:46,206
White women only spell trouble
for any of us.

339
00:28:46,274 --> 00:28:50,643
That's nonsense.
We're just two people trying to stay alive.

340
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:55,572
Lady, you don't know
how hard I'm trying to stay alive.

341
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,050
Sergeant, the telegraph.

342
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:00,344
Do you know how to work
the telegraph key?

343
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,548
No use. The wire is cut.

344
00:29:56,444 --> 00:30:00,778
Well, I suppose I must have slept
sometime during the night.

345
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:03,807
But, I thought that night would never end.

346
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,353
But at any time that night,
did Sergeant Rutledge

347
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:09,618
- threaten or molest you in any way?
- Certainly not.

348
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,487
He never stirred from his cot.

349
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,852
So then, what Captain Shattuck tried
to picture to the court as a brutal

350
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,592
and vicious attack upon you
by Sergeant Rutledge

351
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:22,033
was in reality nothing more than an effort

352
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:24,901
to prevent you from betraying
your presence to those two Apaches?

353
00:30:26,474 --> 00:30:29,705
- Sergeant Rutledge saved my life.
- Thank you.

354
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,844
- Any further questions, Captain Shattuck?
- No questions, sir.

355
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,850
You may step down, Miss Beecher. And
I trust we haven't unduly distressed you.

356
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:45,392
All right, gentlemen. We've had just
about enough of this legal jockeying.

357
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,988
Now, let's put first things first
and clearly establish the facts

358
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:52,430
and the nature of the crimes
with which the accused has been charged.

359
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,798
Call your next witness, Captain Shattuck.

360
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,938
I call Mrs. Colonel Fosgate.

361
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:04,038
What? What did you say?

362
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,343
You mean,
you're calling my wife as a witness?

363
00:31:07,415 --> 00:31:08,677
Yes, sir.

364
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:13,577
Well, if you knew you were gonna
have her on that stand, why didn't...

365
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:17,352
- I called Mrs. Colonel Fosgate.
- I wouldn't have...

366
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:23,163
Well, all right, Sergeant, all right.

367
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,425
Mulqueen, the water.

368
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:31,796
I said, "The water."

369
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:36,502
That footslogger knew all the time
he was gonna have her up there.

370
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:39,174
I'll never be able to...

371
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:05,068
Cordelia,

372
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,807
you were called here as a witness.
What are these other ladies doing here?

373
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:13,711
Otis Fosgate, I would not come here
without a chaperon with all these men.

374
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:16,340
- My goodness, my mother...
- All right, all right.

375
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:19,113
All right, ladies. Sit down,
sit down and be quiet.

376
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,848
Cordelia, take the chair.

377
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:23,484
- The chair?
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

378
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:26,026
- What chair?
- This chair here, ma'am.

379
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:27,318
Oh?

380
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:28,919
Yes, ma'am.

381
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:33,067
- The chair, ma'am.
- Yes, thank you.

382
00:32:33,134 --> 00:32:34,362
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,004
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

384
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:42,975
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God, ma'am?

385
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,103
Is that the King James version
of the Bible?

386
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:47,204
- Do you swear to tell the truth...
- I don't swear on anything

387
00:32:47,281 --> 00:32:49,772
- but the King James Bible.
- Do you swear to tell the truth...

388
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:53,514
Cordelia, a Bible is a Bible.
Put your hand. Go on. Swear.

389
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:55,488
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing...

390
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,750
She does.

391
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:58,948
Carry on, Shattuck.

392
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:03,354
Mrs. Fosgate, do you recognize
the subject of this miniature painting?

393
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:06,560
It's dear little Lucy Dabney.

394
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:11,965
- Lucy Dabney.
- Yes.

395
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:17,937
With the little gold cross
she always wore around her neck.

396
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,880
- I would like to place this in evidence, sir.
- Accepted.

397
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,046
Now, Mrs. Fosgate,

398
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:29,015
you and your husband were quartered
on the post at Fort Linton

399
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,581
- at the time of the murders, were you not?
- Oh, yes.

400
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:34,251
And you knew
the Post Commander Major Dabney

401
00:33:34,328 --> 00:33:37,593
- as well as his young daughter, Lucy?
- Oh, yes, very well.

402
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:39,398
Now, Mrs. Fosgate,

403
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:43,764
I know that to a woman of your breeding,
this is painful beyond words.

404
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:46,306
But I would like you to tell the court,

405
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:49,775
when was the last time
you saw Lucy Dabney alive?

406
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:54,940
The last time I saw Lucy was
at the sutler's store, Mr. Hubble's.

407
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:58,311
She came riding up on her horse.

408
00:33:58,486 --> 00:34:01,546
<i>So young, so lovely.</i>

409
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:07,790
- Hi, Mrs. Fosgate.
- Yes. Hi.

410
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,166
- Hello, Mrs. Hackett.
- Darling.

411
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:23,268
Lucy Dabney, riding astride.

412
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:27,407
When will your father realize
that you're a grownup young lady?

413
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,608
Yes.

414
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:33,877
Papa says as long as I say my prayers and
behave myself with the young lieutenants,

415
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:37,254
he doesn't care if I ride like Lady Godiva.

416
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:39,792
You're a very beautiful young girl,

417
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:43,126
considering you've grown up
without your poor dear mother.

418
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:46,826
- A very nice one.
- Well, thank you, Mrs. Fosgate.

419
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:48,702
Hi, Mr. Hubble.

420
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:51,467
Say, Brax,
you were right about that horse.

421
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:54,007
High-stepping action and sensitive mouth.

422
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:55,837
Thought you'd like her, Miss Lucy.

423
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,010
You know, I took her over
four and a half feet yesterday.

424
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,274
Four and a half feet?

425
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:03,450
You're going to get your neck broke, child.

426
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,544
I don't want you jumping a horse
when I am not around. Do you hear?

427
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:07,849
Yes.

428
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,157
You watch it.

429
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,348
Chris,

430
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:16,393
you got Miss Lucy's order ready?

431
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,662
Sure have, Dad.

432
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:20,564
- Hi, Chris.
- Hi, Lucy.

433
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:24,502
- Four and a half feet.
- Well, I did so!

434
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:27,165
Well,

435
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,505
four feet, anyway.

436
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:37,179
Thank you, Mr. Hubble.

437
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:41,585
My dear, is it wise to be so friendly with...

438
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:45,951
Brax?

439
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:47,924
- Brax Rutledge?
- Yes.

440
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:51,564
Well, I've known him
ever since I was so high.

441
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:54,692
- I know, but...
- He taught me how to ride.

442
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:59,395
Here you are, Lucy. Just like you ordered.
Six skeins of white wool.

443
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:01,498
Say, when are you going to knit me
a pair of socks?

444
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,907
What about Ellie Jorgenson?

445
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:05,878
I don't want that redhead putting burrs
under my saddle.

446
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:09,678
Oh, she won't get jealous over socks.
She is knitting me a sweater.

447
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,479
Say, you better let me help you
with these packages.

448
00:36:11,552 --> 00:36:13,315
They're pretty heavy
for a little girl like you.

449
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:16,356
Come on, Chris Hubble, oh, honest...

450
00:36:39,146 --> 00:36:43,776
<i>That was the last time I saw</i>
<i>Lucy Dabney alive.</i>

451
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:47,287
Now tell me, Mrs. Fosgate.

452
00:36:47,822 --> 00:36:52,816
Tell me in your own words, when was
the last time you saw Sergeant Rutledge?

453
00:36:54,495 --> 00:36:56,019
- You mean...
- Yes.

454
00:36:57,498 --> 00:37:01,764
Well, I was in my bedroom,
writing a letter to my daughter, Barbara

455
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:03,860
at Fort Walla Walla, Washington.

456
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:07,066
She's married to Lieutenant Pritchett.

457
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,975
You know of the Pritchetts
of Pritchettsville?

458
00:37:11,045 --> 00:37:12,103
Yes.

459
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:15,080
And she is expecting again.

460
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:21,116
Well, Otis and I couldn't be more on edge
if it was us.

461
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:23,088
Wouldn't it?

462
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,986
Please, Cordelia, what about Rutledge?

463
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,625
Rutledge? Rutledge who?

464
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:32,656
The accused, Sergeant Rutledge.

465
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:35,463
You said you saw him again that evening,
what about it?

466
00:37:35,536 --> 00:37:38,733
- You were in your room, writing...
- Yes, I was in my room, writing,

467
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:41,274
and I heard two shots. Bang, Bang.

468
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:44,076
So I rushed quickly to the window

469
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:47,005
and I saw him.

470
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:51,882
That gentleman there.

471
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:19,375
<i>It was Sergeant Rutledge,</i>

472
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,310
<i>and I watched him</i>
<i>till he disappeared into the darkness.</i>

473
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:31,386
He was headed straight for East Gate.

474
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:36,828
- Lf you'd like my opinion...
- Thank you, Mrs. Fosgate.

475
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:39,466
Your witness, Lieutenant Cantrell.

476
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,234
Defense does not challenge Mrs. Fosgate's
testimony, sir. There will be no questions.

477
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:48,071
Mr. President, if the Defense Counsel
accepts Mrs. Fosgate's testimony as fact,

478
00:38:48,142 --> 00:38:49,268
must we go on?

479
00:38:49,343 --> 00:38:50,810
Cantrell, why don't you plead
your man guilty

480
00:38:50,878 --> 00:38:52,072
and throw him on the mercy of the court?

481
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:54,376
That's your privilege, Cantrell.
Care to exercise it?

482
00:38:54,448 --> 00:38:55,972
I do not, sir.

483
00:38:56,984 --> 00:39:00,818
Get on with it, Cantrell.
That's all, Cordelia, goodbye.

484
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:04,950
One more question for Mrs. Fosgate
on redirect.

485
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:09,723
Haddock. Captain Haddock.
I knew a Captain Haddock.

486
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,296
He was the veterinarian
who took care of...

487
00:39:12,366 --> 00:39:15,301
- My name is Shattuck, ma'am.
- Shattuck?

488
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:21,398
Now, Mrs. Fosgate, please tell us

489
00:39:21,475 --> 00:39:25,468
when was the exact time you saw
Sergeant Rutledge ride past your window?

490
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:27,605
It was exactly 8:00.

491
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:30,046
Nonsense, Cordelia.

492
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:33,382
You haven't known what time it was
since the day we were married.

493
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:36,782
It was exactly 8:00.

494
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:40,116
Because the clock was striking 8:00.

495
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:45,022
The little china clock
with the painted flowers

496
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:48,360
that you stole
while your men were burning Atlanta.

497
00:39:50,104 --> 00:39:53,198
Thank you, Mrs. Fosgate.
You've been an excellent witness.

498
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:54,605
Is that all?

499
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,873
Shattuck, Haddock. Haddock.
Captain Haddock. Captain Fish.

500
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:01,608
Fish, pretty fish.

501
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:03,608
Fish, Captain Fish.

502
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:05,575
You were wonderful.

503
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,985
Thank you, Captain Fish.

504
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:09,881
You were...

505
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:11,982
Ladies, quiet.

506
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:15,051
Cordelia, quiet, please. Ladies, sit down.

507
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:21,531
Go ahead, Shattuck, go ahead.

508
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:27,498
I call the Fort Linton post surgeon,
Dr. Walter Eckner.

509
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:32,045
Swear him in, Sergeant.

510
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:35,142
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

511
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:36,706
nothing but the truth,
so help you God, sir?

512
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:39,844
- I do.
- Shattuck, I...

513
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:44,449
I suppose you're going to have the doctor
give us all of the frank medical details?

514
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,460
I'm afraid I have no choice, sir. The
condition of both bodies is vital to my...

515
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,825
All right, all right.

516
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:54,393
Sergeant, escort the ladies into the
orderly room. Have them wait there.

517
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:55,862
Yes, sir.

518
00:40:58,105 --> 00:41:00,539
I don't see how you can do...

519
00:41:00,774 --> 00:41:03,174
- You understand, I'm a surprise witness...
- Yes, Mrs. Fosgate.

520
00:41:03,244 --> 00:41:05,735
Yes, ma'am,
but please right through there.

521
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:16,517
Water.

522
00:41:32,606 --> 00:41:33,834
Proceed.

523
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,736
Dr. Eckner,

524
00:41:37,978 --> 00:41:41,812
you were at Fort Linton
the night of the murders,

525
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:43,349
were you not?

526
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,648
As there was no senior officer on the post,

527
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,348
I ordered the bodies left as they were,

528
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,584
and went to meet Lieutenant Cantrell
at the station.

529
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:54,756
The railroad station.

530
00:41:57,331 --> 00:42:00,459
We returned to
Major Dabney's quarters together.

531
00:42:00,968 --> 00:42:03,300
<i>Lieutenant Cantrell and myself.</i>

532
00:42:03,871 --> 00:42:05,702
- What happened?
- Lamp.

533
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:09,470
Glad to see you back, sir. Mighty glad.

534
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,769
This is a terrible thing.

535
00:42:12,146 --> 00:42:14,410
Ladies, this is no place for children
or any of you.

536
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:15,675
Please go to your quarters.

537
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:20,185
- Why, Cordelia!
- The idea of him trying to talk like that!

538
00:42:20,654 --> 00:42:21,916
Get rid of the men
you don't need, Skidmore.

539
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:23,320
Yes, sir.

540
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:27,383
Major Dabney, Lieutenant.

541
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:30,555
Dead by a gunshot wound through
the heart. A service gun.

542
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,724
This toy didn't kill him.

543
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:36,161
- Light that lamp.
- Yes, sir.

544
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,450
It's been fired twice.

545
00:43:07,568 --> 00:43:09,001
Strangled.

546
00:43:17,911 --> 00:43:22,610
Beaten, violated and then strangled!

547
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:23,775
The filthy...

548
00:43:27,054 --> 00:43:29,852
I suppose the Major surprised him
while he was still...

549
00:43:29,923 --> 00:43:34,292
<i>Ja, ja.</i> The Major shoots and wounds him,
you can see the blood here.

550
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:36,320
Then he kills the Major and runs.

551
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:39,025
You see the blood drops
from here to the door.

552
00:43:41,669 --> 00:43:45,935
Why should he stop to cover the body
with a serape so carefully?

553
00:43:46,674 --> 00:43:49,666
A twisted mind, maybe, who knows? Mad!

554
00:43:50,744 --> 00:43:55,340
There is an odd mark also here
on the throat.

555
00:43:55,649 --> 00:43:57,583
Not from strangulation.

556
00:43:58,185 --> 00:44:01,018
More like a cut, but not a cut.

557
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:04,355
Could you hand me that picture, Doctor?

558
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,596
The little gold cross she always wore
around her neck, it's been torn off.

559
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,237
<i>Ja,</i> I remember Lucy's little cross.

560
00:44:25,646 --> 00:44:30,276
Well, you never can tell
about such a criminal. Degenerate.

561
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:36,119
He takes the cross, perhaps
a symbol of the purity he has destroyed.

562
00:44:40,294 --> 00:44:42,592
- Who's sergeant of the guards?
- Skidmore, sir.

563
00:44:44,732 --> 00:44:47,462
Skidmore, send a runner
for the First Sergeant.

564
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,593
- You mean Rutledge, sir?
- Yes. I'm going to need his help on this.

565
00:44:53,006 --> 00:44:54,598
Rutledge is not here, sir.

566
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,372
What the hell do you mean, he's not here?
Where is he? Speak up!

567
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,984
Sir, I just don't know.

568
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:07,076
When was the last time you saw him?

569
00:45:08,655 --> 00:45:10,714
He rode past the guardhouse

570
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:15,455
looking for Major Dabney
shortly before 8:00...

571
00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:16,860
Major Dabney wouldn't be
at the guardhouse.

572
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:18,727
Normally he'd be here in his...

573
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,096
Yes, sir?

574
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:23,035
You mean Rutledge was here?

575
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,269
Rutledge?

576
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,337
But it couldn't be Rutledge.

577
00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:40,680
Assembly at this hour?
What's the idea, Skidmore?

578
00:45:40,788 --> 00:45:43,655
That's why Rutledge
was looking for Major Dabney, sir.

579
00:45:43,724 --> 00:45:46,750
Apache raiding party loose.
Three ranches burned down.

580
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,761
Officer of the guard
must be forming a patrol, sir.

581
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,057
Apaches?

582
00:45:52,266 --> 00:45:54,257
Trouble come double, sir.

583
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:58,736
I had both bodies removed
to the post hospital.

584
00:46:00,073 --> 00:46:03,236
And autopsy confirmed my spot findings.

585
00:46:05,245 --> 00:46:08,976
Major Dabney shot through the heart.

586
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:14,450
His daughter, Lucy, ravaged and strangled.

587
00:46:16,323 --> 00:46:18,348
The work of a degenerate.

588
00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:21,688
The work of a degenerate, indeed.

589
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,325
Your witness, Mr. Cantrell.

590
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:28,734
Oh, no questions.

591
00:46:28,802 --> 00:46:31,635
- What?
- It's stupid not to cross-examine...

592
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,764
Wait a minute, Doctor. Wait a minute.

593
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:35,365
Stay right where you are.

594
00:46:37,177 --> 00:46:38,269
Tom.

595
00:46:40,013 --> 00:46:42,675
That is the second witness
against the accused

596
00:46:42,749 --> 00:46:44,717
that you have failed to cross-examine.

597
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:48,247
Tom, as Defense Counsel,
it is your duty to see...

598
00:46:48,322 --> 00:46:51,553
As Defense Counsel, sir,
I'm only trying to establish the truth.

599
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:52,853
Well, naturally, we all are...

600
00:46:52,926 --> 00:46:56,089
I believe both Dr. Eckner
and Mrs. Fosgate have told the truth.

601
00:46:56,163 --> 00:46:57,653
Tom, that was entirely beside the point...

602
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:01,997
But if you disagree, I'll be very happy
to recall Mrs. Fosgate and...

603
00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:03,668
Step down, Doctor.

604
00:47:05,005 --> 00:47:06,996
All right, Shattuck, call your next witness.

605
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,666
Come on, let's not delay here.

606
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:12,109
I am certain that by now
this court is well aware

607
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:16,309
of the peculiar involvement
of Lieutenant Cantrell in this case.

608
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:21,351
So I trust that I shall not again be charged
with employing cheap, legal tricks

609
00:47:21,555 --> 00:47:25,719
when I call as my next witness,
Defense Counsel himself.

610
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:27,856
Lieutenant Cantrell.

611
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,021
- Well, have you any objections, Cantrell?
- No, certainly not, sir.

612
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,621
All right, get up there. Take the stand.

613
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:34,257
Sergeant, swear him in.

614
00:47:35,335 --> 00:47:36,802
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

615
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:37,996
I do.

616
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:42,699
Dr. Eckner has testified
that after hearing assembly sounded,

617
00:47:42,809 --> 00:47:45,937
you left the scene
of the crimes for post headquarters.

618
00:47:46,013 --> 00:47:48,573
Will you tell us what action you took then?

619
00:47:48,649 --> 00:47:49,638
Certainly.

620
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:52,817
As senior officer present,
I took command of the post

621
00:47:52,886 --> 00:47:56,151
and sent a galloper to the survey camp
to inform Colonel Fosgate.

622
00:47:56,223 --> 00:47:58,191
- You can confirm that, sir?
- Of course, yes, yes.

623
00:47:58,258 --> 00:48:00,385
Now, when the Colonel returned
to the post,

624
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,827
I left with the patrol at once,
by forced march,

625
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:07,789
where we arrived at Spindle Station
shortly after dawn.

626
00:48:54,648 --> 00:48:56,639
Skidmore, take two men
and cover the rear.

627
00:49:22,242 --> 00:49:24,710
- Don't touch that gun, Lieutenant.
- I won't have to,

628
00:49:24,778 --> 00:49:26,439
'cause you're gonna hand me that rifle
butt end first.

629
00:49:26,513 --> 00:49:28,981
No, sir. You take me back now,
they'll hang me sure.

630
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,175
Is that a confession, Rutledge?

631
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,308
Drop it, Brax!

632
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,707
Get him!

633
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,745
Hold him down!

634
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:38,454
Get those arms out here.

635
00:49:48,268 --> 00:49:49,530
Skidmore.

636
00:49:50,504 --> 00:49:53,837
Why didn't you shoot me
when you had the chance?

637
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,099
We may yet.

638
00:49:58,111 --> 00:49:59,271
All right, Skidmore, search him.

639
00:49:59,346 --> 00:50:01,075
And I mean hat, boots, socks,

640
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:03,378
and bring me every single thing
you find on him.

641
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,111
Do what you can to fix up that wound.

642
00:50:07,154 --> 00:50:09,281
Are you all right?
He didn't hurt you, did he?

643
00:50:09,356 --> 00:50:11,916
Of course not. He saved my life.

644
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,424
Did you have to treat him like an animal?

645
00:50:15,195 --> 00:50:17,459
He's under arrest
for the murder of his commanding officer.

646
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:18,725
Oh, I don't believe it.

647
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:22,730
What about your father?
What happened to him?

648
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,398
I don't know. He just never got here.

649
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:29,599
Mary, when I got word at Fort Linton
Apaches were in this district,

650
00:50:29,676 --> 00:50:32,304
- and I'd left you here alone, I was really...
- Not alone.

651
00:50:32,512 --> 00:50:34,070
Sergeant Rutledge was here.

652
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:37,673
And no officer could've protected a woman
more gallantly.

653
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:44,854
Skidmore, bring in the prisoner.

654
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,254
Here's everything we found
on Rutledge, sir.

655
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:50,455
Put it right there.

656
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:54,656
See what this says.

657
00:50:59,172 --> 00:51:04,041
"I, Colonel Thurston Tillman,
of Rutledge Hall, Prince Edward County,

658
00:51:04,177 --> 00:51:08,113

659
00:51:08,281 --> 00:51:09,771

660

"Manumit and entirely set free

"the body and services of

662
00:51:20,761 --> 00:51:22,126
"Braxton Rutledge."

663
00:51:22,696 --> 00:51:25,563
- What did you expect to find, Lieutenant?
- Well, I didn't find it.

664
00:51:25,632 --> 00:51:27,395
All right, Rutledge,
what happened here last night?

665
00:51:27,467 --> 00:51:29,196
- Why don't you ask the lady?
- I'm asking you!

666
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:30,736
Can't you see he's hurt and worn out?

667
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:32,397
Why don't you let him sit down?

668
00:51:32,472 --> 00:51:34,599
- Thank you, ma'am, I can stand.
- Sit down there, Sergeant.

669
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,142
Brax, you heard the Lieutenant. Sit down.

670
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,569
Your wound is open again. Let me see it.

671
00:51:39,646 --> 00:51:41,443
- No, leave me be, miss.
- I will not.

672
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:45,110
Yes, you will. And if you don't mind,
I'm going to ask you to wait outside.

673
00:51:49,156 --> 00:51:51,716
All right, let's have a look at the wound.
Raise up your arms.

674
00:51:55,729 --> 00:51:57,253
Give us a picture
what happened last night.

675
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:58,354
How many hostiles were there?

676
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:01,400
Give it to us, Brax.
We never figured to find you here.

677
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,730
There were 30 or 40 unshod ponies
here last night before the train came in.

678
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,065
Their signs outback show.

679
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:10,567
They killed the stationmaster.

680
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:12,703
Thirty or 40?
There really was a big breakout.

681
00:52:13,914 --> 00:52:17,748
But this wasn't Apaches,
not two small caliber bullet wounds.

682
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:19,444
Did you do it, Rutledge?

683
00:52:20,754 --> 00:52:23,985
I refuse to answer, sir, respectfully.

684
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:28,653
Tie him up.

685
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:31,524
Skidmore, Krump,

686
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:35,499
we're gonna track these hostiles down
and drive them back to the reservation.

687
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,265
All right, move in here
so you can see the map.

688
00:52:39,439 --> 00:52:40,997
Three ranches have been reported
burned out.

689
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,167
There's Jorgenson's here,
over here's Williard's,

690
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,676
and here's Edward Haight's.

691
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,406
Now, the Apaches appear
to be moving due west.

692
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,345
So we're gonna go north by west fast,

693
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,611
and cut them off
before they reach the young lady's home

694
00:52:51,685 --> 00:52:53,209
right here at Spanish Wells.

695
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,117
The young lady goes with us.

696
00:52:55,555 --> 00:52:57,284
Now get the terrain clear in your mind.

697
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:05,060
Rutledge, with that many hostiles loose,

698
00:53:05,131 --> 00:53:07,622
I can't spare anyone
to take you back to Fort Linton.

699
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:09,168
You're riding with us, too.

700
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:12,032
"One hand free" like the book says,
Lieutenant?

701
00:53:12,172 --> 00:53:13,503
You know what the book says,

702
00:53:13,573 --> 00:53:16,667
"One hand free, if and when
we make contact with the enemy."

703
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:20,939
How about that, Top Soldier,
he ain't sending you back.

704
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:22,173
He's letting you ride with us.

705
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:23,614
Half-soldier still Top Soldier.

706
00:53:23,683 --> 00:53:26,811
No, I ain't.
I'm a prisoner, now, in bad trouble.

707
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,215
And I ain't gonna let none of this trouble
rub off on you.

708
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,254
You're 9th Cavalrymen,

709
00:53:32,759 --> 00:53:34,624
and like I said, again and again,

710
00:53:34,928 --> 00:53:37,692
the 9th's record is gonna speak
for us all someday,

711
00:53:37,764 --> 00:53:39,061
and it's gonna speak clean.

712
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,225
Brax, but all we're saying,
we're your friends.

713
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,701
No, you ain't. You ain't no more.

714
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,268
You're not gonna risk
any part of this regiment's record

715
00:53:46,339 --> 00:53:47,431
for one man's good.

716
00:53:47,507 --> 00:53:50,237
Now listen to me, Brax, and hear me well.

717
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:51,704
You tell me yourself

718
00:53:51,778 --> 00:53:53,712
you did that awful thing
down at Fort Linton,

719
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,804
I wouldn't believe it.

720
00:53:55,715 --> 00:53:58,377
But Brax, why did you run away?

721
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:07,557
Because I walked into something
none of us can fight.

722
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,895
White woman business.

723
00:54:12,632 --> 00:54:14,623
Now you heard your Lieutenant, Skidmore.

724
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:18,360
You get that terrain fixed in your head,

725
00:54:18,438 --> 00:54:20,372
because the way he talks,
you're gonna need it.

726
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,075
And don't nobody call me
Top Soldier no more.

727
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:26,738
And that's an order!

728
00:54:31,818 --> 00:54:34,343
- Take the girl's bags into the lean-to.
- Yes, sir.

729
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:40,156
Mary, we're gonna try to get you back
to Spanish Wells.

730
00:54:40,226 --> 00:54:41,750
- Have you got anything to ride in?
- Yes.

731
00:54:41,828 --> 00:54:42,817
Then please get dressed.

732
00:54:43,997 --> 00:54:46,659
I'm not going anywhere until
I can say goodbye to Sergeant Rutledge.

733
00:54:46,733 --> 00:54:48,758
Sergeant Rutledge is riding with us.

734
00:54:48,902 --> 00:54:50,870
- Wounded and handcuffed?
- That's none of your business.

735
00:54:50,937 --> 00:54:53,269
And from now on
I'll have no more backtalk from you

736
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,329
in front of my men.

737
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,735
McLaren, feed a quick breakfast.
We move out in 40 minutes.

738
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:04,747
Skidmore, feed the men,
get the horses ready,

739
00:55:04,818 --> 00:55:06,809
- we move out in 40 minutes.
- Yes, sir.

740
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:10,989
We expect you to be ready in 40 minutes,
Miss Beecher.

741
00:55:16,696 --> 00:55:18,254
Sit down, Brax.

742
00:55:27,974 --> 00:55:30,534
When I rode into Fort Linton last night
and saw what had happened,

743
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:32,009
I couldn't believe my eyes.

744
00:55:33,546 --> 00:55:35,343
It's against everything
I know about you, Brax.

745
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,976
You believe it now, sir, don't you?

746
00:55:39,786 --> 00:55:43,654
You ran out, you deserted.
Now you refuse to make a statement.

747
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:46,791
What else you expect me to believe?

748
00:55:48,528 --> 00:55:49,517
Nothing, sir.

749
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,792
Now, don't you play games with me, Brax.
I know you too well.

750
00:55:53,733 --> 00:55:55,223
You and I served together for six years,

751
00:55:55,301 --> 00:55:57,326
and I know there's no better soldier
in a fight.

752
00:55:58,738 --> 00:56:00,399
And I thought there was no better man.

753
00:56:01,674 --> 00:56:03,403
What does it all add up to, sir?

754
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:09,574
What do you think it adds up to?
Friendship, damn you!

755
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,813
And damn you again!

756
00:56:15,088 --> 00:56:16,612
I'm trying to help you, Brax.

757
00:56:16,689 --> 00:56:20,625
Stay out of it, Lieutenant.
It'll smudge up any man who touches it.

758
00:56:20,693 --> 00:56:21,990
You let me decide that.

759
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,533
What about those rib wounds?

760
00:56:31,037 --> 00:56:32,561
Did Dabney fire at you first?

761
00:56:33,373 --> 00:56:35,273
You can't make self-defense out of it.

762
00:56:41,047 --> 00:56:42,810
There's still that dead white girl.

763
00:56:45,051 --> 00:56:46,951
Nobody will believe I never touched her.

764
00:56:48,555 --> 00:56:50,614
You tell me you didn't, I'll believe you.

765
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,952
Would you repeat that, Lieutenant?

766
00:57:05,454 --> 00:57:09,254
I said to Rutledge,
"You tell me you didn't, I'll believe you."

767
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:11,452
You said that, after what you'd seen
with your own eyes

768
00:57:11,527 --> 00:57:12,960
- there at Fort Linton?
- I did.

769
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,553
But you were the arresting officer,
weren't you?

770
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:16,257
- Yes, I was.
- And you had your man in irons

771
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:17,492
- for murder, didn't you?
- I did.

772
00:57:18,734 --> 00:57:21,225
Well, what did Rutledge say
when you offered to believe him?

773
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:24,669
He said, "Maybe you believe me, sir,

774
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,104
"but not any court-martial."

775
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,972
Go on with your testimony

776
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:32,139
from where you told the prisoner
you'd believe him.

777
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:36,509
Well, after that,
we watered and fed the troop,

778
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,315
and started out north by west

779
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,818
in an attempt to cut the Apaches off

780
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,323
<i>before we reached Miss...</i>

781
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:46,221
<i>Miss Beecher's home at Spanish Wells.</i>

782
00:57:58,507 --> 00:58:00,372
How's the side holding up, Sergeant?

783
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,708
You know what they say about us, sir,
we heal fast.

784
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:05,508
You give me your word
you won't try to make an escape,

785
00:58:05,581 --> 00:58:07,208
I'll take the irons off you.

786
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:09,114
I can't do that, sir,

787
00:58:09,685 --> 00:58:12,153
'cause I ain't going back to stand trial.

788
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:13,846
Don't you be a fool, Brax.

789
00:58:14,423 --> 00:58:15,447
What if you did get away?

790
00:58:15,524 --> 00:58:17,549
Why, this thing would haunt you
till you couldn't stand it.

791
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,117
You forget, sir,

792
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,925
we've been haunted a long time,
too much to worry.

793
00:58:22,698 --> 00:58:25,633
Yeah, it was all right for Mr. Lincoln
to say we were free,

794
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:29,865
but that ain't so. Not yet.
Maybe some day, but not yet.

795
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:30,928
All right, Rutledge.

796
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:35,036
But you make one move to get away,
and I'm gonna kill you.

797
00:58:35,811 --> 00:58:37,108
Yes, sir.

798
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,710
But that's just what you'll have to do.

799
00:58:50,626 --> 00:58:52,457
Troop, halt!

800
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:03,768
Vultures.

801
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,165
Krump, Moffat, over there.

802
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,161
What... What is that, Moffat?

803
00:59:30,566 --> 00:59:33,091
Man staked out, and he's awful dead.

804
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,335
Dead, dead.

805
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:38,002
Call out, Bull Horn.

806
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,308
Dead man. Staked out!

807
00:59:45,314 --> 00:59:47,441
Dead man. Staked out!

808
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:49,947
- My father.
- Don't jump at it, Mary.

809
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,281
Take it easy.

810
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:52,582
Skidmore.

811
01:00:00,262 --> 01:00:01,923
There in the rock, sir.

812
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,541
It's a young man.

813
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:23,109
Krump, you ride back
and tell Miss Beecher it isn't her father.

814
01:00:23,185 --> 01:00:24,584
- Yes, sir.
- And keep her away from here.

815
01:00:24,653 --> 01:00:25,915
Yes, sir.

816
01:00:26,989 --> 01:00:28,854
Moffat, you got the stomach
to go through his clothes

817
01:00:28,924 --> 01:00:31,586
for identification and personal effects,
or do you want me to do it?

818
01:00:32,294 --> 01:00:33,386
Somebody better.

819
01:00:34,463 --> 01:00:36,124
His own mammy wouldn't recognize him.

820
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,369
What's going on, Corporal?

821
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,033
None of your business. You hush.

822
01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:50,639
Don't be a-fretting, Miss.
Don't be a-fretting.

823
01:00:56,385 --> 01:00:59,752
Stripped clean. Boots, gun belt, hat, even.

824
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:03,625
Nothing left but torn shirt and pants,
and this tobacco sack.

825
01:01:03,692 --> 01:01:06,354
- Well, who is he? Does anybody know?
- I know him, sir.

826
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:09,923
He was wearing
the same Kansas City shirt last night

827
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,432
when I was on guard duty.

828
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:15,096
That's Chris Hubble, the sutler's son.

829
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,267
- Chris Hubble?
- Yes, sir.

830
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:23,571
Well, what's he doing way out here?
That's a horse-killing ride.

831
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:26,376
I heard he been sparking
the Jorgenson girl, sir.

832
01:01:26,982 --> 01:01:29,815
Maybe when he got news
of the Apache raid on her father's ranch...

833
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:31,318
Moffat, let me look at that.

834
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:33,414
Here.

835
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,797
Maybe you'd tell me
what you keep looking for, sir?

836
01:01:49,638 --> 01:01:52,198
Sergeant, I didn't find
what I was looking for this time, either.

837
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,369
All right, Skidmore, 10 minutes for burial.

838
01:01:56,445 --> 01:01:58,538
I know the ground's hard,
but get him under as far as you can.

839
01:01:58,614 --> 01:01:59,603
Yes, sir.

840
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,134
Whoa.

841
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,748
<i>That smoke was between us</i>
<i>and the San Rosario reservation.</i>

842
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:44,191
Now, if this was a sport uprising

843
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:47,055
designed to blood the young braves
who had never known war,

844
01:02:47,129 --> 01:02:50,895
the chances are they would go on back
to the reservation on their own.

845
01:02:51,066 --> 01:02:52,226
If not?

846
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:54,326
Well, I was there to drive them back.

847
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:57,930
A very interesting story, Lieutenant,
which I don't challenge.

848
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,497
But I would like to call
the court's attention

849
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:02,237
to one all-important factor
in this testimony,

850
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:06,714
and that is Lieutenant Cantrell's
personal interest in the accused.

851
01:03:07,149 --> 01:03:10,880
And I quote from
the manual for court-martial, which states,

852
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:15,956
"In case of personal interest in
or personal hostility toward the accused,

853
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,687
"defense counsel should apply
to be relieved."

854
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:22,564
Well, now this is a hell of a time
to bring that up with the trial half-over.

855
01:03:22,631 --> 01:03:24,155
Excuse me, sir.

856
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,197
But Captain Shattuck
is playing ducks and drakes

857
01:03:26,268 --> 01:03:27,326
with this court again.

858
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:30,804
If he would quote the text in its entirety,
it begins with the words,

859
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:33,535
"Defense counsel is not challengeable."

860
01:03:33,642 --> 01:03:35,803
All right, Lieutenant.
Read the book, Mulqueen.

861
01:03:36,645 --> 01:03:39,546
"Defense counsel is not challengeable."

862
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:41,207
"Challengeable."

863
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,046
Over here. Hand it here. Give me the book.

864
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:46,144
- Challengeable.
- All right

865
01:03:49,658 --> 01:03:51,353
"Challengeable..."

866
01:03:52,294 --> 01:03:53,818
Well, that's quite a bit different.

867
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:58,394
Mulqueen, this is a Confederate manual.

868
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:01,129
- Read the flyleaf, Colonel.
- I can read right here, it says...

869
01:04:01,203 --> 01:04:03,603
Read the flyleaf, Colonel.

870
01:04:05,874 --> 01:04:09,776
"This manual is adopted
with no changes from the manual

871
01:04:09,845 --> 01:04:12,006
"of the United States Army."

872
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:13,446
Where'd you get that thing?

873
01:04:13,515 --> 01:04:15,779
If it please the court, I stole it in Atlanta

874
01:04:15,851 --> 01:04:19,252
the night your men burned the place,
including the convent.

875
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:20,811
My specs, sir.

876
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:24,316
- Water?
- No.

877
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,888
- Well, Cantrell, do you wish to withdraw?
- I do not, sir.

878
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,360
All right, Shattuck, carry on.

879
01:04:30,432 --> 01:04:32,229
Water. No, never mind.

880
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,530
That will be all, Lieutenant.

881
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:38,037
I call as my next witness
Sergeant Matthew Skidmore.

882
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:49,674
Skidmore. All right, take the stand.

883
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:52,277
All right, Sergeant, swear him in.

884
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,419
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

885
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:57,220
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

886
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:58,851
I do, I do.

887
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:01,091
Your name, Sergeant?

888
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,693
Troop Sergeant Matthew Luke Skidmore.

889
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:07,700
Troop C, 9th United States Cavalry, sir.

890
01:05:07,936 --> 01:05:10,700
Skidmore, just how old are you?

891
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,405
Well, sir,

892
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:14,370
I don't rightly know.

893
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,604
You mean you don't even know
your own age?

894
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:19,880
I was slave-born.

895
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,844
And I saw the first steamboat
come down the Mississippi River.

896
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:29,684
At least my mammy said it was the first,
and she was holding me up to see.

897
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:31,689
That would make you at least 70 or more.

898
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,660
Mr. President,
what is this line of questioning?

899
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:36,061
- Skidmore is a good soldier.
- Excellent soldier.

900
01:05:36,131 --> 01:05:37,689
First-rate, Shattuck,

901
01:05:37,766 --> 01:05:39,631
I suppose you have a reason
for this type of questioning?

902
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:43,331
Well, sir, I was merely trying to establish
the Sergeant's reliability as a witness.

903
01:05:43,405 --> 01:05:45,270
- I withdraw the question.
- Get on with it.

904
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:48,174
Skidmore, the patrol report states
that you pressed on

905
01:05:48,243 --> 01:05:50,108
after seeing the burning ranch house.

906
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,237
I'd like to hear your version
of what happened then.

907
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:56,447
Well, sir, like you say,
the Lieutenant forced a march

908
01:05:56,518 --> 01:05:57,951
trying to get the young lady home

909
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:01,353
and make sure that the Apaches
was headed back to the reservation.

910
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:04,993
We sent out gallopers and flankers,

911
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,893
and we took all the necessary precautions.

912
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:16,431
- Sure leaving a sloppy, wide-open trail.
- And a slow one.

913
01:06:17,072 --> 01:06:18,505
And if they're heading back
for the reservation,

914
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:20,633
they're taking their own sweet time
about it.

915
01:06:20,709 --> 01:06:25,169
Them young warriors get to showing off
to one another, anything can happen.

916
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,709
Sir, as an old soldier...

917
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:30,377
Bugler, Moffat,
circle off and take the point!

918
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:31,510
Yo!

919
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:47,133
- Keep your eyes open, Skidmore.
- Yes, sir.

920
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:48,863
- Rutledge.
- Sir.

921
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,872
You got the same hunch I have, sir.

922
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:02,740
- How about a weapon?
- When the time comes.

923
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:06,015
- Just like the book say?
- Just like the book say.

924
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:32,739
Attention! Right on a line!

925
01:07:34,249 --> 01:07:36,581
Prepare to dismount! Dismount!

926
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:39,117
Forward skirmishes!

927
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:01,135
Company, ready!

928
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:02,569
Fire!

929
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,092
You ain't shooting ducks, rookie.

930
01:08:35,477 --> 01:08:37,775
- Come back, Moffat!
- Come back, Moffat!

931
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,246
Corporal Moffat, come back!

932
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:47,612
Pull up, Moffat, pull up!

933
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,929
- Moffat!
- Horse running away, sir?

934
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:57,929
- Moffat!
- Moffat!

935
01:09:03,805 --> 01:09:05,796
Come on. Come on.

936
01:09:25,627 --> 01:09:28,323
Canteen, Brax, my canteen.

937
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:30,558
Can't give you no water, Moffat,
not with that wound.

938
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,524
Then just let me be.

939
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:37,163
Stop that talk.
I got to get you back up to the section.

940
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:39,568
No good, Sergeant.

941
01:09:40,108 --> 01:09:42,576
Hold onto me and let me down easy.

942
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:45,604
Brax. Brax!

943
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,514
I'm here, Moffat. I'm right here, Moffat.

944
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:51,181
My three little girls.

945
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:53,880
What's gonna happen to them, Brax?

946
01:09:54,556 --> 01:09:57,650
Someday, Moffat,
they gonna be awful proud of you.

947
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:02,091
Someday.

948
01:10:02,397 --> 01:10:05,298
You're always talking about someday

949
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:08,636
like it gonna be a promised land
here on Earth.

950
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:10,230
Brax.

951
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:16,574
We're fools to fight the white man's war.

952
01:10:16,945 --> 01:10:20,904
It ain't the white man's war.
We're fighting to make us proud.

953
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,808
Someday your little girls...

954
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,581
Moffat, do you hear me? Moffat.

955
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,777
How is he, Rutledge?

956
01:11:01,089 --> 01:11:02,818
Moffat's dead, sir.

957
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:31,744
Hold it, Rutledge.

958
01:11:36,291 --> 01:11:37,553
Hold it!

959
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:39,824
- Sir!
- No.

960
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:55,172
Well, that closes our book, Miss Beecher.

961
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,176
We buried Trooper Moffat.

962
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,751
And then we followed the Apache trail
toward Crazy Woman River,

963
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:11,485
which we had to cross
to get the young lady home.

964
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,184
So, here it is again.

965
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:16,823
Lieutenant Cantrell,
with a record as a dead shot

966
01:12:16,898 --> 01:12:21,028
with all weapons that goes back
to his cadet days on the Hudson,

967
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:24,903
somehow missed with a service pistol
at 50 yards.

968
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:28,704
A miss, mind you,
that enabled his prisoner to escape.

969
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,005
That's all, Skidmore.

970
01:12:30,078 --> 01:12:32,945
Skidmore, one moment, if you please.

971
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:37,151
Now Sergeant Skidmore,
you're under oath.

972
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:41,979
Would you please tell the court
in your opinion as a long-service soldier,

973
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:44,490
did I deliberately miss that pistol shot?

974
01:12:44,559 --> 01:12:45,958
Oh, no, sir.

975
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:48,359
When you took aim, he was a dead man.

976
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:51,422
And the second time
when I tried with the carbine?

977
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,900
Yes, the same thing.
If the young lady hadn't...

978
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,995
Right, thank you very much,
Sergeant Skidmore, that's all.

979
01:13:00,675 --> 01:13:03,803
Uphill, moving target, service pistol.

980
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:06,004
I might have missed him myself.

981
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:11,544
Get on with it, Shattuck.

982
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:16,550
I'm sure this court is aware
that no one can tell us the rest of the story

983
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,752
except the accused himself.

984
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,494
But I cannot call him.

985
01:13:22,597 --> 01:13:23,723
Well, why not?

986
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:24,959
It's the duty of this court...

987
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:27,001
The accused
cannot be compelled unwillingly

988
01:13:27,068 --> 01:13:29,195
to testify against himself.

989
01:13:29,604 --> 01:13:33,700
But even so,
I am quite sure that Lieutenant Cantrell

990
01:13:33,775 --> 01:13:35,766
does not dare have him testify.

991
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:37,505
On the contrary, sir,

992
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:40,639
the accused welcomes
the opportunity to testify.

993
01:13:41,449 --> 01:13:45,112
Will you call him, Captain Shattuck,
or shall I?

994
01:13:49,991 --> 01:13:53,791
First Sergeant Braxton Rutledge,
9th United States Cavalry.

995
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,733
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

996
01:14:03,805 --> 01:14:05,568
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

997
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:07,634
I do.

998
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,846
I'd like you to pick it up
from where Sergeant Skidmore left it,

999
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:19,387
where you had so miraculously escaped

1000
01:14:19,454 --> 01:14:21,979
Lieutenant Cantrell's shots at you.

1001
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:26,417
I rode full gallop for Crazy Woman River.

1002
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:30,893
I figured if I could reach the upper ford
and cross over,

1003
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:36,266
I could follow the water north
to the railroad.

1004
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:41,475
<i>After a couple of hours,</i>
<i>the Apache trail was still leading me</i>

1005
01:14:41,943 --> 01:14:43,934
<i>like they was making for the river, too.</i>

1006
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:59,557
<i>And then I came down</i>
<i>over the top of the river bank,</i>

1007
01:15:00,328 --> 01:15:01,454
<i>and there they were.</i>

1008
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:07,460
<i>Crossing the river fast,</i>
<i>like they was really going someplace.</i>

1009
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,206
Easy, boy.

1010
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,042
Easy, boy.

1011
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:40,701
<i>All that land across the river</i>
<i>was part of Mr. Sam Beecher's ranch,</i>

1012
01:15:40,902 --> 01:15:42,426
<i>Spanish Wells.</i>

1013
01:15:57,218 --> 01:15:59,948
<i>I knew then the young lady</i>
<i>would never get home.</i>

1014
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:03,419
<i>Not ever.</i>

1015
01:16:28,783 --> 01:16:33,186
I recognized the old gentleman
from the times I've seen him at the fort.

1016
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:37,689
It was Mr. Sam Beecher.

1017
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:41,528
The young lady's father.

1018
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:45,727
What happened then,

1019
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,268
I don't like to remember.

1020
01:16:51,706 --> 01:16:54,140
<i>I knew the patrol</i>
<i>was coming up behind me,</i>

1021
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:56,806
<i>and there was the Indians ahead of me.</i>

1022
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:59,278
<i>I had to keep going.</i>

1023
01:17:00,715 --> 01:17:03,809
<i>I had to cross over the river</i>
<i>if I was going to break free.</i>

1024
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:51,597
<i>I tried to tell myself</i>
<i>what happened to the 9th Cavalry</i>

1025
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:53,759
<i>weren't no concern of mine.</i>

1026
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:56,464
<i>I wasn't Top Soldier no more.</i>

1027
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:59,567
<i>Now was my time to ride away.</i>

1028
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:02,800
<i>Ride away north, where I'd be free.</i>

1029
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:10,080
Miss Beecher, to the rear of the column!

1030
01:18:38,546 --> 01:18:39,945
To the rear!

1031
01:18:45,386 --> 01:18:47,854
- Ambush, sir!
- All right, get back!

1032
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:17,951
Sir, like the book say?

1033
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:28,689
Top Soldier back!

1034
01:19:29,497 --> 01:19:31,624
Stop that yelling and start shooting.

1035
01:19:31,799 --> 01:19:33,061
Squeeze them triggers.

1036
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:00,354
Thank you, ma'am.

1037
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,130
Take it easy, rookie.

1038
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:09,067
Easy now, rookie. Easy, rookie.

1039
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:39,197
And that's how it was, sir.

1040
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:41,201
And we dug in on our position
for the night,

1041
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:42,566
and did what we could for the wounded.

1042
01:20:43,037 --> 01:20:44,766
Now, let me get this straight, Rutledge.

1043
01:20:44,839 --> 01:20:47,967
What you're asking this court to believe
is that, with freedom before you,

1044
01:20:48,042 --> 01:20:51,876
you deliberately turned your back on it,
and by an incredible ride

1045
01:20:51,946 --> 01:20:56,645
and a noble disregard for your own life,
you saved that patrol from annihilation.

1046
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:59,881
No, sir. That ain't how I meant it,
and there was nothing noble about it.

1047
01:20:59,954 --> 01:21:04,254
Oh, come, Rutledge, of course there was.
It was a brave act, admit it.

1048
01:21:04,325 --> 01:21:05,690
And I wasn't thinking brave.

1049
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,251
Then what were you thinking?
Why did you come back? Tell us.

1050
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:10,297
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1051
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:12,589
All I know, I kept riding.

1052
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:15,629
And something kept telling me
I had to go back.

1053
01:21:16,904 --> 01:21:18,132
It was like...

1054
01:21:20,174 --> 01:21:21,368
It was like...

1055
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:25,474
I just ain't got the words to say it.

1056
01:21:25,546 --> 01:21:27,571
Then I'll say it for you.

1057
01:21:27,915 --> 01:21:31,817
Bravery is your stock and trade, Rutledge.
Your whole record shows it.

1058
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:36,649
But murderers and rapists
can be as brave as decent men.

1059
01:21:36,724 --> 01:21:38,954
You are trying to trade
your murderer's bravery

1060
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:40,722
for the mercy of this court, isn't that it?

1061
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:42,057
No, sir. That is not...

1062
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:43,859
All right, Rutledge.
If that isn't it, what was it?

1063
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,268
It was because the 9th Cavalry
was my home.

1064
01:21:50,204 --> 01:21:54,072
My real freedom. And my self respect.

1065
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:56,643
And the way I was deserting it,

1066
01:21:57,945 --> 01:22:01,847
I wasn't nothing worse
than a swamp-running nigger.

1067
01:22:03,551 --> 01:22:05,212
And I ain't that.

1068
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:09,046
Do you hear me? I'm a man.

1069
01:22:15,029 --> 01:22:18,157
This goading of the witness
is beyond belief.

1070
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:22,597
Shattuck, in the name
of common decency.

1071
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:26,299
Decency? Stop acting like a child, Cantrell.

1072
01:22:26,607 --> 01:22:30,270
I'm not trying for a hanging verdict
merely to whitewash this mess.

1073
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,939
This man killed your commanding officer,
admits it.

1074
01:22:33,514 --> 01:22:35,744
He's as guilty as hell, and you know it.

1075
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:37,915
Prosecution rests.

1076
01:22:43,424 --> 01:22:47,554
If Sergeant Rutledge hasn't answered
Captain Shattuck's attack

1077
01:22:47,628 --> 01:22:49,687
to the court's satisfaction,
I can only say this.

1078
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:52,198
If he had not been my prisoner

1079
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:56,503
during the action at Crazy Woman River,

1080
01:22:56,571 --> 01:23:00,405
I would have cited him for gallantry
above and beyond the call of duty.

1081
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:12,243
Before the defense opens its argument,

1082
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:15,779
this court will take a brief recess.

1083
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:21,024
Sergeant, open those doors,
air this place out a little.

1084
01:23:21,095 --> 01:23:22,392
Yes, sir.

1085
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:28,129
Excellent statement that Rutledge made.

1086
01:23:28,202 --> 01:23:30,727
Shows a fine loyal feeling for his regiment,
poor devil.

1087
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:33,069
And a good soldier.
I served with him myself.

1088
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:35,507
I hate hangings. Bad for troop morale.

1089
01:23:35,576 --> 01:23:38,067
We'll have no more talk about hangings.

1090
01:23:38,379 --> 01:23:39,903
Incidentally, I'm glad
that none of you gentlemen

1091
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:41,539
have mentioned the color
of the man's skin.

1092
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:43,846
Very well put, Mr. President.

1093
01:23:45,052 --> 01:23:46,451
Jacks or better?

1094
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:48,921
- Size of the pot, $5.
- I'm out.

1095
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:52,687
I see your five, and raise you 20.

1096
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,421
- I'm out.
- I pass.

1097
01:23:58,599 --> 01:23:59,793
Give me three cards.

1098
01:24:02,336 --> 01:24:03,963
Cards, Mulqueen.

1099
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:11,408
Mulqueen, are you bluffing again?

1100
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:19,176
Ten-hut!

1101
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:53,684
Order!

1102
01:24:53,754 --> 01:24:56,882
You men back there, get those hats off.
Put out those butts.

1103
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:03,294
All right, Cantrell, proceed.

1104
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:12,663
As my first witness,
I recall Miss Mary Beecher to the stand.

1105
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:25,481
Mary, I called you back to the stand
because I want you to tell the truth.

1106
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:28,181
Now, tell exactly what happened
that night at Crazy Woman...

1107
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:32,590
I intend to tell the truth,
no matter what you ask me.

1108
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:38,160
Now, Miss Beecher,

1109
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:43,363
would you please tell the court
what happened after the attack in the river

1110
01:25:43,704 --> 01:25:45,296
and we had dug in for the night?

1111
01:25:46,874 --> 01:25:49,604
Well, it had turned bitterly cold.

1112
01:25:50,878 --> 01:25:54,439
And we did all we could for the wounded
to make them comfortable.

1113
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:59,019
And it was then that you took me aside,

1114
01:25:59,086 --> 01:26:02,351
and told me how Sergeant Rutledge had...

1115
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:06,153
<i>Had seen my father die.</i>

1116
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:17,630
Mary, I don't know if this will be
any consolation or comfort to you,

1117
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,403
but Rutledge says
that your father died quickly.

1118
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:23,542
Nothing like that Hubble boy.

1119
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:27,474
You know, it's strange, Tom.

1120
01:26:28,482 --> 01:26:30,848
I can't even remember my father's face.

1121
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:37,324
All I can remember
is just the touch of his hand on my cheek.

1122
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:40,254
Such a rough hand,

1123
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:43,323
oh, so gentle.

1124
01:26:46,934 --> 01:26:50,131
No, Tom, I hate this land.

1125
01:26:51,238 --> 01:26:54,401
It killed my mother,
and now it killed my father.

1126
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:57,769
I wish I'd never come back to it.

1127
01:26:57,845 --> 01:27:01,042
Oh, but, Mary, it's a good land. It really is.

1128
01:27:01,782 --> 01:27:03,443
Maybe not now, but

1129
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:08,483
like Rutledge says, "Someday."

1130
01:27:08,789 --> 01:27:10,689
Tom, you're not going
to take him back now, are you?

1131
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:15,026
For the first time,
I don't really know what I'm gonna do.

1132
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:18,464
Because you know they'll hang him
if you do.

1133
01:27:21,969 --> 01:27:26,235
Tom, you know he never touched that girl.

1134
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:32,811
I just have to think about it
a little bit more, Mary.

1135
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:36,945
Just a little bit more.

1136
01:28:36,343 --> 01:28:37,605
Who's Captain Buffalo?

1137
01:28:39,613 --> 01:28:40,807
Oh, he's a...

1138
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:47,020
Well, when the Plains Indians
first saw the troopers of the 9th Cavalry,

1139
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:48,248
it was in the dead of winter

1140
01:28:48,322 --> 01:28:51,951
and they were all wearing
buffalo coats to keep them warm.

1141
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:55,393
They had buffalo caps on.
They looked like buffaloes.

1142
01:28:56,764 --> 01:28:59,562
Consequently, the Indians started
calling them buffalo soldiers.

1143
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:04,904
And Captain Buffalo is...
Well, he's the ideal soldier, you know.

1144
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:07,707
Giant size, kind of a Paul Bunyan.

1145
01:29:10,377 --> 01:29:13,778
I guess they're laying it on
a little thick now for Rutledge.

1146
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:16,080
Try to give him confidence
and cheer him up.

1147
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:17,583
What a wonderful way to do it.

1148
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:40,668
Too bad we couldn't take Otway back
for a real military funeral.

1149
01:29:41,642 --> 01:29:44,202
He sure earned
his 50 cents a day yesterday.

1150
01:29:45,045 --> 01:29:48,412
Top Soldier, you wanna read burial service
for Otway?

1151
01:29:48,482 --> 01:29:51,747
No, sir.
We're gonna do it upright for him, Krump.

1152
01:29:52,219 --> 01:29:54,779
We're gonna wait for the Lieutenant
to read the words over him.

1153
01:30:09,336 --> 01:30:11,133
Feel all right, Skidmore?

1154
01:30:11,505 --> 01:30:12,904
I'll make it.

1155
01:30:13,474 --> 01:30:14,839
Thank you, miss.

1156
01:30:26,887 --> 01:30:30,288
Lieutenant will never put those irons
back on you now, Top Soldier.

1157
01:30:30,357 --> 01:30:33,053
That's the truth, Brax.
Like I told you when he took them off,

1158
01:30:33,127 --> 01:30:35,391
he ain't never gonna put them
back on you again.

1159
01:30:35,462 --> 01:30:38,124
Yeah. It's more like
they recommended Top Soldier

1160
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:40,326
for the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1161
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:41,663
- Ain't that so?
- That's right.

1162
01:30:41,735 --> 01:30:42,895
- Yeah.
- That's right.

1163
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,028
He's right, Top Soldier.

1164
01:30:44,104 --> 01:30:47,164
General Nelson "Handsome" Miles himself
will come down to pin it on you.

1165
01:30:47,241 --> 01:30:50,176
General Miles? That's small fry.

1166
01:30:51,178 --> 01:30:53,840
The President himself is gonna call
Brax back to Washington

1167
01:30:53,914 --> 01:30:55,973
just so he can shake his hand.

1168
01:30:56,317 --> 01:30:59,650
Top Soldier strutting into
that big, blessed White House

1169
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,813
where Mr. Abraham Lincoln lives.

1170
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:06,524
Brax, don't you count on going free.

1171
01:31:08,028 --> 01:31:10,496
The Lieutenant is a strong man for duty.

1172
01:31:10,564 --> 01:31:14,022
- He's got to take you back.
- No, Sergeant Skidmore.

1173
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:15,830
He'll never take him back now.

1174
01:31:15,903 --> 01:31:18,565
Soldier can never
think by his heart, ma'am.

1175
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:20,238
He got to think by the book.

1176
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:25,307
It's against both my oath and my duty
to say this to you.

1177
01:31:26,146 --> 01:31:27,773
Brax, you've got to go.

1178
01:31:28,549 --> 01:31:30,016
And you better go now.

1179
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:33,515
Lieutenant's coming back.

1180
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:51,435
When the burial party's finished,
send them down here.

1181
01:31:51,505 --> 01:31:52,494
Yo.

1182
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:24,565
Mary Beecher,

1183
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:27,864
will you come down here, please?

1184
01:32:27,942 --> 01:32:29,239
Krump! McClaren!

1185
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:42,446
Mary, I'm sorry to have to ask you
to do this, but I need a witness.

1186
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,554
It's a little gold cross.

1187
01:32:49,797 --> 01:32:51,389
But what does it mean?

1188
01:32:51,598 --> 01:32:52,826
I'm not sure what it means.

1189
01:32:53,767 --> 01:32:57,032
You just remember that you saw me
take it off a dead Apache.

1190
01:32:57,538 --> 01:32:58,630
All right.

1191
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:07,945
Bring that jacket with you, too.

1192
01:33:19,426 --> 01:33:21,155
Well, how are you, Sergeant?
You're gonna make it?

1193
01:33:21,228 --> 01:33:22,388
I'm ready for duty, sir.

1194
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:25,855
How about our rookie here?
How're you feeling this morning?

1195
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:27,662
He's a brave soldier, sir.

1196
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:31,261
I's brave, but I's awful scared, too, sir.

1197
01:33:31,338 --> 01:33:33,067
Well, you're a good man.

1198
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:35,973
In another nine or 10 years
you're gonna make corporal.

1199
01:33:36,043 --> 01:33:38,978
- The Lord's truth, sir?
- Lord's truth.

1200
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:45,149
There's a mark on it, sir. "C.H."

1201
01:33:51,091 --> 01:33:53,855
All right, Krump,
you're acting platoon sergeant.

1202
01:33:53,994 --> 01:33:55,018
Yes, sir.

1203
01:33:55,095 --> 01:33:57,086
We move out for Fort Linton
in 20 minutes.

1204
01:34:05,305 --> 01:34:06,431
Rutledge.

1205
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:25,951
Tom, I thought you said last night...

1206
01:34:28,662 --> 01:34:33,361
Why, you cheap, contemptible,
tin-plated, book soldier!

1207
01:34:35,402 --> 01:34:37,927
Would you mind repeating that,
Miss Beecher?

1208
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:43,471
I said he was a cheap, contemptible,
tin-plated, book soldier.

1209
01:34:44,044 --> 01:34:47,571
Thank you, Miss Beecher,
you may step down.

1210
01:34:48,082 --> 01:34:49,310
Miss Beecher,

1211
01:34:50,551 --> 01:34:52,178
there isn't a man in this court

1212
01:34:52,252 --> 01:34:54,743
who didn't know and deeply respect
your father, Sam Beecher.

1213
01:34:54,822 --> 01:34:56,187
Very fine gentleman.

1214
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:58,622
Will you please accept
our deepest sympathies for your loss?

1215
01:34:58,692 --> 01:35:00,091
Thank you.

1216
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:02,560
And now, is there anything more
you would like to tell this court

1217
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:04,529
- before you leave this stand?
- Yes, there is.

1218
01:35:05,566 --> 01:35:07,966
Sergeant Rutledge saved all our lives.

1219
01:35:08,702 --> 01:35:12,229
And in common decency,
Lieutenant Cantrell at least owes him his.

1220
01:35:38,966 --> 01:35:40,297
Miss Mary Beecher

1221
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:43,866
has identified this cross
with this broken chain,

1222
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:46,569
as the one I took
from the dead Apache's headband.

1223
01:35:56,583 --> 01:35:58,915
And these 27 affidavits
from the commissioned,

1224
01:35:58,986 --> 01:36:01,750
enlisted, and civilian personnel
at Fort Linton

1225
01:36:01,822 --> 01:36:03,790
have testified that that cross

1226
01:36:04,324 --> 01:36:07,191
is the one that was habitually worn
by Lucy Dabney.

1227
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:10,788
The cross which our post surgeon,
Dr. Eckner, has testified

1228
01:36:10,864 --> 01:36:13,230
was torn from her neck.
That's correct, Doctor?

1229
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:14,623
Correct.

1230
01:36:25,512 --> 01:36:29,107
Miss Beecher has also identified
this bloodstained hunting jacket.

1231
01:36:33,187 --> 01:36:36,247
Now, I'd like to call the court's attention
to the initials

1232
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:40,256
that have been burned into the jacket,
on the inside.

1233
01:36:41,228 --> 01:36:43,458
The initials C.H.,

1234
01:36:44,831 --> 01:36:47,664
which are the initials of the sutler's son,
Chris Hubble...

1235
01:36:47,834 --> 01:36:49,096
- What's your point?
- Now, just a minute.

1236
01:36:49,169 --> 01:36:50,796
...whose body we found on the trail

1237
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:54,432
and who is the only person from whom
the Apaches could have taken that cross.

1238
01:36:56,476 --> 01:36:58,444
Quiet. Quiet!

1239
01:36:59,179 --> 01:37:01,443
I'll have order in this court!

1240
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:09,755
Lieutenant, if you've rested your case,
proceed with the summation.

1241
01:37:09,823 --> 01:37:10,949
Ready with summation, sir.

1242
01:37:11,858 --> 01:37:14,986
You've now heard all the testimony
of both the defense and prosecution.

1243
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:20,255
And yet, neither side has been able
to place before you a witness

1244
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:23,261
who actually saw the crimes

1245
01:37:23,804 --> 01:37:26,295
which the accused, Sergeant Rutledge,
is alleged to have committed.

1246
01:37:28,575 --> 01:37:31,339
Now Sergeant Rutledge has told you,
of his own free will,

1247
01:37:31,411 --> 01:37:33,936
that he entered Major Dabney's quarters.

1248
01:37:34,781 --> 01:37:35,770
But

1249
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:39,350
on urgent duty,
to inform him of the Apache raids.

1250
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:45,558
And that there he found the naked body
of the Dabney girl strangled.

1251
01:37:47,127 --> 01:37:51,723
And moved by an impulse
of pity and decency,

1252
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:55,960
he was about to cover
that poor, young body with a serape

1253
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:58,938
when Major Dabney entered, and Dabney,

1254
01:37:59,606 --> 01:38:01,733
in blind fury and outrage,

1255
01:38:01,808 --> 01:38:04,709
opened fire upon him,
wounding him grievously twice.

1256
01:38:05,445 --> 01:38:07,379
And it was then and only then,

1257
01:38:07,447 --> 01:38:11,543
in defense of his own life, that he returned
the fire, killing Major Dabney.

1258
01:38:12,853 --> 01:38:14,684
Now the trial judge advocate

1259
01:38:16,356 --> 01:38:21,055
states that this is a bald-faced lie
and charges rape and murder.

1260
01:38:24,464 --> 01:38:28,093
And the defense maintains
that this story is the simple truth,

1261
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:32,261
and that Sergeant Rutledge's action,
in defense of his own life,

1262
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:34,634
is justifiable homicide.

1263
01:38:37,177 --> 01:38:40,635
So we may say that
in circumstantial evidence,

1264
01:38:41,181 --> 01:38:42,876
this trial is deadlocked.

1265
01:38:46,486 --> 01:38:49,284
The scales of justice hanging
in even balance,

1266
01:38:50,123 --> 01:38:52,216
but being capable of tipped

1267
01:38:52,693 --> 01:38:57,460
one way or the other by one iota,
of just one featherweight,

1268
01:38:58,131 --> 01:39:00,998
of direct and tangible evidence.

1269
01:39:04,805 --> 01:39:07,205
Now defense has introduced
that evidence.

1270
01:39:07,774 --> 01:39:09,605
This golden cross right here

1271
01:39:11,044 --> 01:39:12,272
and this coat.

1272
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:17,214
And as much as it pains me

1273
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:20,344
in the presence of
the young man's bereaved father,

1274
01:39:21,855 --> 01:39:23,516
not even he

1275
01:39:24,224 --> 01:39:26,215
can tell us where his son was

1276
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:28,386
that one full hour
before the shots were heard.

1277
01:39:29,663 --> 01:39:33,997
So I maintain that there is only
one possible conclusion to be reached,

1278
01:39:36,103 --> 01:39:39,595
that Chris Hubble violated
and murdered Lucy Dabney,

1279
01:39:40,574 --> 01:39:43,543
and First Sergeant Rutledge
is innocent of the crimes.

1280
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:47,937
Order in this court! Silence!

1281
01:39:50,917 --> 01:39:51,906
Order!

1282
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:53,708
Order.

1283
01:39:54,187 --> 01:39:55,711
Quiet, everybody!

1284
01:39:57,023 --> 01:39:58,285
Order!

1285
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:25,744
I must deplore,
as I'm sure that this court does,

1286
01:40:26,686 --> 01:40:30,417
Defense Counsel's cruel
and clumsy attempt

1287
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:32,617
to shift the burden of guilt

1288
01:40:33,026 --> 01:40:37,360
to the dead son of this heartbroken man,
Mr. Hubble.

1289
01:40:38,231 --> 01:40:42,258
A dead boy,
unable to speak for himself now.

1290
01:40:42,903 --> 01:40:45,167
And to attempt to shift it, mark you,

1291
01:40:45,272 --> 01:40:49,641
by the cheap theatrical device
of this trinket.

1292
01:40:52,446 --> 01:40:56,815
He claims proof
that the Dabney girl wore this cross

1293
01:40:56,883 --> 01:40:58,248
around her neck.

1294
01:40:58,585 --> 01:41:02,351
All he has actually shown
is that she wore a cross.

1295
01:41:03,924 --> 01:41:07,724
Most of the women of the Southwest
are God-fearing women.

1296
01:41:08,662 --> 01:41:12,621
And a cross around their necks
is not an unusual ornament.

1297
01:41:13,733 --> 01:41:16,224
Nor is this cross unique,

1298
01:41:16,703 --> 01:41:19,866
unusual, or in any way

1299
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:22,568
in of itself identifiable.

1300
01:41:22,843 --> 01:41:26,779
As the contents of this box
will prove to you.

1301
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:36,346
I defy Defense Counsel to mix this,

1302
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:39,654
the original cross, with these others

1303
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:41,725
and then tell this court

1304
01:41:42,329 --> 01:41:44,229
which is which.

1305
01:41:44,297 --> 01:41:46,390
- I object!
- Objection is not in order.

1306
01:41:46,466 --> 01:41:48,559
Captain Shattuck is merely
meeting argument with argument.

1307
01:41:50,203 --> 01:41:51,329
Oh, Lieutenant,

1308
01:41:53,406 --> 01:41:56,933
could you identify this cross
if I mixed it with all these others?

1309
01:41:57,844 --> 01:41:58,970
You know I couldn't, sir.

1310
01:41:59,646 --> 01:42:02,547
He's even broke the chain on... I...
No, I couldn't.

1311
01:42:05,719 --> 01:42:07,084
Proceed, Captain Shattuck.

1312
01:42:09,856 --> 01:42:11,289
As for this coat,

1313
01:42:12,993 --> 01:42:16,929
despite Mrs. Fosgate's testimony
that she saw it at the sutler's store,

1314
01:42:17,831 --> 01:42:20,459
it's a fairly common garment
in this district.

1315
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:23,394
And as for the initials C.H.,

1316
01:42:23,904 --> 01:42:28,204
the Apaches might have taken it from
any of those looted, burned-out ranches.

1317
01:42:28,675 --> 01:42:30,973
It might have belonged to Charlie Haight.

1318
01:42:31,044 --> 01:42:34,309
Or to the foreman at Williard's,
Clay Hagathorn.

1319
01:42:35,549 --> 01:42:38,382
So much for Lieutenant Cantrell's

1320
01:42:38,518 --> 01:42:41,419
tangible, direct evidence.

1321
01:42:43,857 --> 01:42:47,418
I have just two more points to make,
and then I shall be done.

1322
01:42:48,228 --> 01:42:51,493
First, at no time in these proceedings

1323
01:42:51,565 --> 01:42:55,331
has Defense Counsel
been able to convincingly explain

1324
01:42:55,569 --> 01:42:57,969
the most damning fact of all.

1325
01:42:58,204 --> 01:43:01,935
If Rutledge was not guilty, why did he run?

1326
01:43:04,077 --> 01:43:07,444
Point number two is a delicate one.

1327
01:43:07,747 --> 01:43:10,147
A shadowy thing that, in a way,

1328
01:43:10,216 --> 01:43:12,810
has hung over this court
from the very start.

1329
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:17,488
Well, I would like to call
the court's attention to the fact

1330
01:43:17,824 --> 01:43:19,758
that it was not I

1331
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,726
who tried to shift the guilt

1332
01:43:22,829 --> 01:43:26,196
to a dead white boy to save this man!

1333
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:31,569
It was not I who stooped to use
the symbol of the cross

1334
01:43:31,705 --> 01:43:34,731
to pin the hateful charge of rape

1335
01:43:34,808 --> 01:43:38,869
on a dead white boy to save this man!

1336
01:43:39,079 --> 01:43:42,480
And finally, it was not I

1337
01:43:42,549 --> 01:43:46,076
who tried to write the word "murderer"

1338
01:43:46,152 --> 01:43:50,145
on the gravestone
of that innocent white boy

1339
01:43:50,223 --> 01:43:53,090
to salvage the life and freedom

1340
01:43:53,159 --> 01:43:55,457
- of this negro!
- I object!

1341
01:43:58,298 --> 01:44:02,029
If the color of a man's skin
is to be introduced as evidence,

1342
01:44:02,102 --> 01:44:03,501
or even argument,

1343
01:44:04,337 --> 01:44:05,702
by this court,

1344
01:44:06,539 --> 01:44:10,202
then I say it's this court
that stands on trial, and not that soldier!

1345
01:44:10,276 --> 01:44:11,607
Mr. Cantrell!

1346
01:44:13,446 --> 01:44:15,812
This court has been very patient with you,

1347
01:44:15,882 --> 01:44:18,783
knowing of your long service
with Sergeant Rutledge,

1348
01:44:19,419 --> 01:44:22,946
but I will not tolerate an attack
upon this court's integrity.

1349
01:44:23,523 --> 01:44:26,014
And may I also point out to the court

1350
01:44:26,092 --> 01:44:28,754
that in violation
of all the rules and procedures,

1351
01:44:28,828 --> 01:44:30,989
Defense Counsel is interrupting
my argument.

1352
01:44:31,064 --> 01:44:32,224
You may not!

1353
01:44:33,233 --> 01:44:37,169
Now, the one overriding rule
of this court-martial, or any court-martial,

1354
01:44:37,671 --> 01:44:40,105
is to seek out truth and administer justice,

1355
01:44:40,173 --> 01:44:42,698
and that is exactly what we're going to do.

1356
01:44:44,377 --> 01:44:45,742
Take your places.

1357
01:44:50,817 --> 01:44:54,548
Gentlemen, in my opinion, this entire case

1358
01:44:54,788 --> 01:44:56,585
hangs on this little cross.

1359
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:59,383
Is it or is it not Lucy Dabney's?

1360
01:45:00,894 --> 01:45:02,987
- And on this coat.
- Sir,

1361
01:45:04,264 --> 01:45:07,722
if it's permitted,
I think that I could pick out that cross.

1362
01:45:08,668 --> 01:45:10,932
Even if you mixed it with the others.

1363
01:45:12,305 --> 01:45:16,935
I sold it to Major Dabney
for little Lucy's twelfth birthday.

1364
01:45:18,645 --> 01:45:21,546
There's a little nick under the crossbar

1365
01:45:22,248 --> 01:45:24,148
that she discovered herself.

1366
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:27,117
Well, damn it! He's right!
It's right there, you see?

1367
01:45:27,854 --> 01:45:31,187
I offered to exchange it,
but Lucy said, "No."

1368
01:45:31,725 --> 01:45:34,558
She said that way
she'd always know it as her own.

1369
01:45:35,028 --> 01:45:36,996
Sir, I must object!

1370
01:45:37,097 --> 01:45:40,965
This is not testimony.
This man is not even under oath.

1371
01:45:41,034 --> 01:45:43,628
But it may be truth and justice,
Captain Shattuck.

1372
01:45:43,703 --> 01:45:46,103
Mr. Hubble,
will you take the stand, please?

1373
01:45:46,172 --> 01:45:48,197
Do I need to? I've...

1374
01:45:48,274 --> 01:45:50,139
Come right on up, Mr. Hubble.

1375
01:45:57,450 --> 01:46:00,078
It's all right, Mr. Hubble. Sit down, please.

1376
01:46:00,553 --> 01:46:01,542
Sergeant, swear in the sutler.

1377
01:46:01,621 --> 01:46:04,181
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

1378
01:46:04,257 --> 01:46:05,884
- so help you God?
- I do.

1379
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:14,064
All right, Captain Shattuck,
according to the rules and procedures,

1380
01:46:14,134 --> 01:46:17,262
- you may question the witness first.
- No questions, sir.

1381
01:46:18,605 --> 01:46:21,005
Lieutenant Cantrell? Your witness.

1382
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:30,042
Mr. Hubble, why did you tell me
at Fort Linton

1383
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:33,184
that you could not identify Lucy's cross?

1384
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,309
I...

1385
01:46:37,524 --> 01:46:38,889
It was too soon.

1386
01:46:40,093 --> 01:46:41,458
Chris was my son.

1387
01:46:42,428 --> 01:46:43,656
My only son.

1388
01:46:46,032 --> 01:46:48,125
It's hard for a man to admit.

1389
01:46:50,503 --> 01:46:54,701
It's all right. It's all right.
You take your time, collect yourself.

1390
01:46:55,575 --> 01:46:56,564
No...

1391
01:46:58,278 --> 01:46:59,540
My boy is dead.

1392
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:03,578
The truth can't hurt him now.
Not anymore.

1393
01:47:05,718 --> 01:47:08,118
I wanted to believe it was the Sergeant.

1394
01:47:08,188 --> 01:47:11,646
Now I can't stand by and see him hung
for something my boy did.

1395
01:47:13,092 --> 01:47:16,892
Would you please tell us
how you think it happened?

1396
01:47:18,398 --> 01:47:19,763
Well, after he...

1397
01:47:22,101 --> 01:47:24,695
After he did the thing,

1398
01:47:24,971 --> 01:47:28,202
he must have torn the cross off Lucy.

1399
01:47:31,945 --> 01:47:32,934
But why?

1400
01:47:34,113 --> 01:47:36,581
- Why would he do that?
- Go on, Mr. Hubble.

1401
01:47:38,184 --> 01:47:39,173
Well,

1402
01:47:40,186 --> 01:47:42,177
like I told you at Fort Linton,

1403
01:47:42,255 --> 01:47:44,746
I was upstairs when he ran into the house.

1404
01:47:45,058 --> 01:47:47,583
Shouted up something
about the Apache raids.

1405
01:47:47,894 --> 01:47:51,125
- When I came down, he was gone.
- And the coat was gone, too?

1406
01:47:51,798 --> 01:47:54,767
- The coat?
- Yes. The hunting jacket. It was gone, too?

1407
01:47:55,068 --> 01:47:56,330
Yes, it was.

1408
01:47:58,738 --> 01:47:59,864
Mr. Hubble,

1409
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:04,603
it was when Colonel Fosgate
was about to call attention to the coat

1410
01:48:05,945 --> 01:48:08,311
that you offered to identify the cross.

1411
01:48:10,617 --> 01:48:12,312
What is your first name?

1412
01:48:12,785 --> 01:48:14,844
They call you Chan, don't they?

1413
01:48:14,921 --> 01:48:17,754
- That's right, short for Chandler.
- Chandler Hubble.

1414
01:48:17,824 --> 01:48:19,155
C.H.

1415
01:48:27,267 --> 01:48:29,633
Is that Chris' coat or is it your coat?

1416
01:48:29,702 --> 01:48:33,798
You know, Chris was not a big man.
Won't you stand up? Let's try the coat on.

1417
01:48:34,073 --> 01:48:37,941
No, I never said it wasn't my coat.
Chris just grabbed the first thing.

1418
01:48:38,878 --> 01:48:40,903
Yes, he grabbed the first thing,

1419
01:48:41,381 --> 01:48:42,814
and whatever was in the pockets.

1420
01:48:42,882 --> 01:48:45,510
And that cross was in the pocket
because you put it there.

1421
01:48:45,585 --> 01:48:47,416
- That's not so.
- No, you had the same opportunity

1422
01:48:47,487 --> 01:48:49,387
as Chris. You knew Lucy
was gonna be alone, didn't you?

1423
01:48:49,455 --> 01:48:50,547
- No.
- Yes, you did.

1424
01:48:50,623 --> 01:48:53,990
You knew Lucy was gonna be alone.
And now, to save your own neck,

1425
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:57,393
you're trying to pin the shame of it
on Chris, your own dead son.

1426
01:48:57,463 --> 01:48:59,294
- Lies. Lies!
- Why?

1427
01:48:59,432 --> 01:49:02,833
Because you knew Lucy was alone
and Lucy trusted you

1428
01:49:02,902 --> 01:49:04,199
as everybody trusted you.

1429
01:49:04,270 --> 01:49:07,262
You went there
and strangled and killed her.

1430
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:10,468
- Why?
- No! I had to.

1431
01:49:10,543 --> 01:49:12,977
- I had to!
- Cantrell!

1432
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:15,704
Don't you understand?

1433
01:49:15,848 --> 01:49:19,079
Gee, the way she walked!
The way her body moved.

1434
01:49:19,152 --> 01:49:22,178
She drove me crazy! I had to have her!

1435
01:49:22,255 --> 01:49:24,348
I had to! I had to!

1436
01:49:26,592 --> 01:49:28,526
You know I had to!

1437
01:49:29,395 --> 01:49:32,262
God, help me! God, help me!

1438
01:49:33,366 --> 01:49:36,199
Place that man under restraint. Doctor...

1439
01:49:38,972 --> 01:49:41,065
Why, Mr. Hubble.

1440
01:50:03,696 --> 01:50:05,357
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1441
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:14,138
Well, go ahead,

1442
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:16,336
say it.

1443
01:50:18,211 --> 01:50:21,112
Mary, you're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

1444
01:50:22,048 --> 01:50:24,243
And don't you forget I said it to you.

1445
01:50:36,496 --> 01:50:38,191
Eyes left!

1446
01:50:42,368 --> 01:50:43,528
Front!

1447
01:51:25,378 --> 01:51:26,640
English
