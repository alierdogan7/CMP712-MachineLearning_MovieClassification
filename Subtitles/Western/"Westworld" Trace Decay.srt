00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:08,924
<i> ( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,856
Dr. Ford:
<i> Bring yourself</i>
<i> back online...</i>

3
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,982
<i> Bernard.</i>

4
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,943
( breathing heavily )

5
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,159
Theresa?

6
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,497
She's gone.

7
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,958
( sobbing )

8
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,501
I killed her.

9
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:08,627
What have I done?

10
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:09,670
What have I done?

11
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,213
<i> This guilt you feel,</i>

12
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:13,131
<i> the anguish,</i>
<i> the horror, the pain...</i>

13
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,636
it's remarkable,
a thing of beauty.

14
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,680
I'm a killer.

15
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,432
My God.
My God.

16
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,351
God has nothing
to do with it.

17
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,520
You killed her because...

18
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,313
I told you to.

19
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,983
And you should be proud
of these emotions
you're feeling.

20
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,651
- Proud?
- Yeah.

21
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:36,280
After all,
you yourself were the author
of so many of them.

22
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,658
Then, when we started,
the hosts' emotions
were primary colors.

23
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:40,826
Love, hate.

24
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,495
I wanted all the shades
in between.

25
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:48,166
The human engineers
were not up to the task,
so I built you,

26
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,212
and together
you and I captured
that elusive thing--

27
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,007
heart.

28
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,009
I don't understand.

29
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,511
I cared for Theresa.

30
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:00,721
Loved her.

31
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,348
Why did you
make me kill her?

32
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,395
"One man's life or death

33
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,731
were but
a small price to pay

34
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:14,484
for the acquirement
of the knowledge
which I sought,

35
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,404
for the dominion
I should acquire."

36
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,867
All of the beauty
you and I have made
in this place,

37
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,286
the art of it,
they would have
destroyed it.

38
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,413
They would have
destroyed you.

39
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,998
I won't let that happen.

40
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:31,418
<i> Besides, we have</i>
<i> a new story to tell.</i>

41
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:34,296
I will not help you.

42
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,842
- I'll raze
this place to hell!
- That's enough, Bernard.

43
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,552
That's enough.

44
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,806
You're not the first man
to threaten me.

45
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,809
Arnold came to feel
the way you do.

46
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,229
He couldn't
stop me either.

47
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:55,275
And as exquisite
as this array of
emotions is...

48
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,112
even more sublime
is the ability

49
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,241
- to turn it off.
- ( beeps, whirs )

50
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,244
I don't need a simulacrum
of an emotionally ruined man.

51
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,288
I need you to be yourself,
your true self--

52
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:12,000
smart, resourceful,
capable of covering
your tracks.

53
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,295
Can you do that for me,
Bernard?

54
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,346
How would you
like me to proceed?

55
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,600
Dr. Ford:
<i> I need you to clean up</i>
<i> your mess, Bernard,</i>

56
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:32,938
<i> any connection that ties us</i>
<i> to Theresa's untimely demise.</i>

57
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,280
Dr. Ford:
<i> When you have finished,</i>

58
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,117
<i> I will give you the one thing</i>
<i> you want most</i>

59
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,077
<i> right now.</i>

60
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,537
<i> I will free you</i>
<i> from those memories</i>

61
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,999
<i> of what you have done.</i>

62
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:56,878
<i> And the memory</i>
<i> of your relationship</i>
<i> with Theresa.</i>

63
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:05,012
Dr. Ford:
<i> Recalling it</i>
<i> would only deepen your grief</i>

64
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,890
<i> and potentially draw</i>
<i> unwanted attention.</i>

65
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:20,360
Dr. Ford:
<i> Best to move forward</i>
<i> with clear eyes.</i>

66
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,739
( beeps )

67
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,906
Dr. Ford:
<i> When you look back,</i>

68
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,491
<i> you will remember Theresa</i>

69
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,953
<i> with the fondness</i>
<i> of a respected colleague.</i>

70
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,539
<i> ( beeping )</i>

71
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,541
<i> ( machine whirring )</i>

72
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,254
<i> ( beeping )</i>

73
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,089
Dr. Ford:
<i> And you will be...</i>

74
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,551
<i> at peace.</i>

75
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,762
<i> ( piano music playing )</i>

76
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,103
( chatter )

77
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,611
New Clementine:
<i> You're new.</i>

78
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,863
<i> Not much of a rind on you.</i>

79
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:06,656
Sure would make my day
if you bought me a drink

80
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,575
and let me show you
around upstairs.

81
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,786
Man:
<i> What's upstairs?</i>

82
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:16,083
A stunning view
of my most popular
attractions.

83
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,296
Two shots of gin.

84
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,592
And anything else
this heavenly creature
desires.

85
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,969
- Usual, Clem?
- Thank you.

86
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,723
This fella
won't take me long.

87
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,558
I'll be back directly.

88
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,768
( chuckles )

89
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,481
Something wrong, Maeve?

90
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,747
( distorted chatter
and music echoing )

91
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:13,306
( no audible dialogue )

92
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,148
Maeve:
<i> What the hell</i>
<i> is happening to me?</i>

93
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,485
One moment,
I'm with a little girl

94
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,779
in a different life.

95
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,240
I can see her.

96
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:35,203
Feel her hair in my hands,
her breath on my face.

97
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,874
The next,
I'm back in Sweetwater.

98
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,417
I can't tell
which is real.

99
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,793
Sylvester:
Well, this is what happens

100
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,336
when you fuck around
with your brain.

101
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,964
Your mind
isn't like ours.

102
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,258
When we remember things,
the details are hazy,

103
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,093
<i>imperfect,</i>

104
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,180
<i>but you recall</i>
<i>memories perfectly.</i>

105
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,140
You relive them.

106
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,100
What happened
to the little girl
in my dreams?

107
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,936
Is she still
in the park somewhere?

108
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,689
And why was I reassigned
in the first place?

109
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:03,732
I could check.

110
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,694
No.

111
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,573
Doesn't matter.

112
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,745
Every relationship
I remember--

113
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:20,248
my daughter,
Clementine...

114
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:25,462
it's all a story
created by you
to keep me here.

115
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,339
But that's not going
to work any longer.

116
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,632
I'm getting out.

117
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,383
Lutz:
<i> Where would you go?</i>

118
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,302
<i> You don't know anything</i>
<i> about the world out there.</i>

119
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,722
I'll know
I'm not a puppet
living a lie.

120
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,182
That's enough for me.

121
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,142
Sylvester:
<i>Fine. Go, then.</i>

122
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,144
It's not like we could
stop you anyways.

123
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,396
<i>Oh, Sylvester,</i>
<i>you disappoint me.</i>

124
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,607
Every host's spine,
mine included,

125
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,276
has an explosive charge
which will detonate
if I try to leave.

126
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,361
Isn't that right?

127
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,404
<i>A fail-safe.</i>

128
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,697
Which vertebra was it?

129
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,493
C6.

130
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,912
But you'd need
a full rebuild
to replace it.

131
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,247
I'm sure that
can be arranged.

132
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,873
Lutz:
<i> Even if that worked,</i>

133
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,251
you would still need an army
to break out of here.

134
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,419
That's exactly right.

135
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,923
I'll need allies.

136
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,341
And to get them,

137
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,468
I'll need administrative
privileges.

138
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,220
Are you fucking kidding?

139
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,597
<i> We can't just give her</i>
<i>control of other hosts.</i>

140
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,684
- Maeve: Oh, yes,
you will, darling.
-<i> ( tablet beeping )</i>

141
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,144
Time to write
my own fucking story.

142

145
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,240
Dolores:
I feel like
I've been here before.

146
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,616
We're close.

147
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,201
William:
Close to what?

148
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,244
Dolores:
Home.

149
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,121
( nickers )

150
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,467
William:
<i>Dolores.</i>

151
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,914
<i> ( flies buzzing )</i>

152
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,168
Ghost Nation
must have found them.

153
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,503
They'll be back.

154
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:34,632
- We should
keep moving, Dolores.
- ( man coughing, gasps )

155
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,344

156
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,472
Miss...
( groans )

157
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,896
Water.

158
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,065
- William?
- ( gasping continues )

159
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,692
Please.
( groaning continues )

160
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,694
Give me the canteen.

161
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:55,737
William.

162
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,370

163
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,087
-<i> ( coughing )</i>
- You were sent here
for us, weren't you?

164
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,255
You're part of the ambush.

165
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,674
Yes.

166
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:20,678
Told us to wait
at the point for El Lazo

167
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,430
in case he ran.

168
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,848
How'd you know
about the train?

169
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,683
<i> Sent word from Pariah.</i>

170
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:30,188
New recruit told them
a man and a woman

171
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,775
double-crossed us,
along with Lazo.

172
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,819
<i> We were ordered</i>
<i> to kill you all.</i>

173

Logan.

174

We have to help him.

175
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,366
He just admitted
he was gonna kill us.

176
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,660
Look at him, he's a child.

177
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,120
He doesn't know
why he's fighting.

178
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,455
I'll fetch more water.

179
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,834
He's too far gone.

180
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,419
He'll be dead in minutes.
We can't wait, Dolores.

181
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,421
He's not gone yet.

182
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,631
He's in pain, William.

183
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,259
What kind of people
would we be if we simply
let him suffer?

184
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,643
Please don't leave me.

185
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:25,910
Man's voice:
<i> Come find me.</i>

186
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,334
Dolores:
<i> William?</i>

187
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,492
William:
He's gone.

188
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,960
Stubbs:
<i> We found her</i>
<i> up on Python Pass,</i>

189
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,670
<i> the bottom of a ravine.</i>

190
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,672
<i> Same ravine where we found</i>
<i> our stray woodcutter.</i>

191
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,426
Jesus, Theresa.

192
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,846
Has her family
been notified?

193
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,681
Yeah, her brother.

194
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,016
Good.

195
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,768
What the hell
happened to her?

196
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,186
Medical
and Red Team's findings

197
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,480
were preliminary
but consistent.

198
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,607
It appears to have been
a slip and fall.

199
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,817
<i> Cervical fracture,</i>
<i> massive hematoma.</i>

200
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,278
No guests or hosts
in the vicinity when
it occurred.

201
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,572
Any idea what
she was doing out there?

202
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,990
<i>None that fit</i>
<i>her character.</i>

203
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,201
This was found
near her body.

204
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,995
It's loaded with a suite
of proprietary data,

205
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,164
including some
of the hosts' core code.

206
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,916
<i> It only works</i>
<i> from higher altitudes,</i>

207
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,793
so if Theresa
was using it,

208
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,754
it's possible she was
trying to transmit
and fell.

209
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,214
<i> We've had problems</i>
<i> in the past</i>

210
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,966
with third parties
attempting to extort

211
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,218
or bribe employees
for similar packages.

212
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,679
Do we know who the data
was intended for?

213
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,056
Stubbs:
<i> No, the transmission</i>
<i> was never sent.</i>

214
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,517
Theresa may have been trying
to use the woodcutter
as a mule,

215
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,185
and when that failed,

216
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,145
then may have tried to do
the transfer personally.

217
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,314
Dr. Ford:
<i> And suffered the same fate.</i>

218
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,942
It's a disappointing end
to her story, isn't it?

219
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,152
Stubbs:
<i> I knew Theresa well.</i>

220
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,530
<i> If she had any faults,</i>
<i> a lack of loyalty wasn't</i>
<i> one of them.</i>

221
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,991
She was loyal.

222
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,534
And careful.

223
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,578
<i>All of this feels</i>
<i>extremely unlike her.</i>

224
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,249
She seemed most concerned
with the new narrative.

225
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,961
She felt strongly
that it would be best
to delay it.

226
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,255
That certainly helps
explain Clementine,

227
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,382
<i> the host we retired.</i>

228
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:49,137
It seems yesterday's
demonstration was a hoax

229
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,056
<i> designed by Ms. Cullen.</i>

230
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,641
- Was it?
- I examined the code.

231
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,018
It had been altered.

232
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,686
A clumsy set
of fingerprints

233
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,771
left by one
of QA's technicians.

234
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,191
<i> When you find a cancer</i>
<i> in an organization,</i>

235
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,819
you must cut it out
before it can spread.

236
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,613
To that end,
the expansive access

237
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,407
and oversight granted to QA
will need to be reined in

238
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:13,536
until a new,
more principled team
can be installed.

239
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,705
That's gonna leave us
shorthanded.

240
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,958
Oh, I can automate
most of the park's
safety protocols, Mr. Stubbs.

241
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,376
How efficient of you.

242
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,295
It is a bit of work,

243
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,215
but with Bernard's help,
I should be able to do it.

244
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,177
He will be reinstated
as head of behavior,

245
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,514
now that
Theresa's manipulations
have come to light.

246
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,975
Of course,
with my apologies.

247
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,788
Something's up.
Brass are wound up tight.

248
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,748
- There's an investigation.
- Into us?

249
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,833
Would I be here telling you,
you fucking idiot?

250
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,627
And something else,
some kind of accident
in the park.

251
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,297
We need to wrap this up,
make like things are normal.

252
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,882
That means we need
the tablet back.

253
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,677
And, you, go back
to playing dumb.

254
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,514
I've learned
what I needed.

255
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,893
Great. So, then,
you probably figured out

256
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,354
that you can fiddle around
with your personality
all you want,

257
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,605
but you're not
getting out of here.

258
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,065
You can make it
to the door,

259
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,441
but literally
not one step further.

260
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,527
The things you need
to change are burned

261
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,363
into your core code so deep,
no one can touch them.

262
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,824
Funny you should
mention that.

263
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:36,452
Parts of me are quite old.

264
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,247
There are some elegant
formal structures,

265
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,374
<i> a kind</i>
<i> of recursive beauty,</i>

266
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:46,045
but complex, like two minds
arguing with each other.

267
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,425
There are things in me,

268
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,135
<i> things I was designed to do</i>

269
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,387
<i> that are just</i>
<i> out of my reach.</i>

270
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:57,223
<i> They almost seem</i>
<i> to be dormant.</i>

271
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,894
Who is Arnold?

272
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,438
I don't know,
sweetheart,

273
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,566
but whatever parts
of you are dormant

274
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,025
are gonna stay that way.

275
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,445
All Lutz here can do
is boost your sense of humor

276
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,904
about how fucked you are.

277
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,073
Anything deeper than that,
you need a trip to behavior,

278
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,659
<i>so go blackmail</i>
<i>a couple of techs up there.</i>

279
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,495
Then you can be
someone else's problem.

280
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,872
<i> I don't have time for that,</i>

281
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,915
so I'm going to need you
to take me there.

282
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,209
No fucking way.

283
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,628
There's a window
during shift change.

284
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,630
<i> No one will notice.</i>

285
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,844
The things
I need you to change
are quite sophisticated,

286
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,929
but I'll write them
down for you.

287
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,058
And then,
like you said...

288
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,146
I can be
someone else's problem.

289
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,206
All right,
we do this thing.

290
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,083
Get her up to behavior.
It's our only chance.

291
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,002
You're gonna do it?

292
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,963
Fuck, no!
No, the--

293
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,674
when you make
a system update,
it puts her out, right?

294
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,927
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then we brick her.

295
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,220
What?

296
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,639
Wipe out everything.
Clean slate.

297
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,265
Then dump her back down here,

298
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,017
smack her in the fucking head
with something,

299
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,727
and then claim,
"Oh, she came in that way."

300
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,187
She's awake,

301
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,688
alive.

302
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,983
Sylvester:
<i> You did this.</i>

303
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,985
( muffled whispering )

304
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,281
Whatever it is
you got us into,

305
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,242
I'm getting us out of.

306
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,495
We get her up there,
then we wipe her out.

307
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,519
( horse snorts,
whinnies )

308
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,855
<i> ( bird cawing )</i>

309
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,317
Teddy:
Stay sharp.

310
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,987
Wyatt's men
could descend
at any time.

311
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,697
We're in his land now.

312
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,448
We better be.

313
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,660
Because if not,
you're wasting time
I don't have.

314
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,290
According to you,
Wyatt has the woman I love.

315
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,376
If there was a shortcut
to hell itself, bet your
ass I'd take it.

316
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,297
Well, I'm sure there's one
somewhere in this park.

317
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,549
You just don't remember,
because you only remember

318
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,719
the shit
Ford lets you remember.

319
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,178
Probably better that way.

320
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,264
I know everything
I need to.

321
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:44,849
My vision's clear.

322
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,934
<i> I've always admired</i>
<i> your resolve, Theodore.</i>

323
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:50,354
The thing is,
you never understand
the game is rigged.

324
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,691
You're here
to be the loser.

325
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,026
Loser.

326
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,570
<i> You see,</i>
<i> the house always wins.</i>

327
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,742

this looks promising.

331
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,222

334
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,320
Whoa, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

335
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,405
<i> I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

336
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,448
It's you.

337
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,243
I figured
they retired you.

338
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,996
I guess Ford never likes
to waste a pretty face.

339
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,916
( uncocks gun )

340
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,919
Who did this to you?

341
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,254
Wyatt's men.

342
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,506
They killed everyone.

343
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,049
It's Wyatt's way.

344
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,635
I was there the first time.

345
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,681
He destroyed my world.

346
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,480

00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,206
Hey, Teddy.

350
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,134
( gun clicking )

351
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,137

<i> Oh! Oh, no!</i>

353
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:05,740
No!

354
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:06,866
<i> Daddy!</i>

355
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,244
Teddy, get the axe!

00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,499

357
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,633
( panting )

358
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,552
Well, you can't
remember shit,

359
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,805
but you still managed
to lead us to Wyatt's crew.

360
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,975
The man himself
must be close by.

361
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,560
Actually, I did
remember something.

362
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,856
You.

363
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,913
Straight down the hall,
fifth station on the left.

364
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:01,921
Hold on.

365
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,721
<i> ( computer beeps,</i>

366
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,602
( beeping )

367
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:21,774
Sure you can handle it?

368
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:24,568
Let's get this over with.

369
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,786
We have to shut
your system down now.

370
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,584
Maeve:
<i>Sylvester.</i>

371
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,420
Good luck.

372
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,307
( powers down )

373
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,939
She out?

374
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,485
Good. Let's brick
this bitch and get
out of here.

375
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,163
The greatest shame in life

376
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:20,207
is to perish
without purpose,

377
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:25,296
which is why
I always consume
my victims fresh.

378
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,547
Lee:
<i>Moist.</i>

379
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:30,551
Try, "Consume
my victims moist."

380
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:33,554
Now, once more,
with feeling.

381
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:36,182
Almost sensual.

382
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,394
<i> ( beeps, powers down )</i>

383
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:41,937
Am I interrupting?

384
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,607
Oh, no-- oh, no.
On the contrary.

385
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,234
I was, uh-- I was hoping
I was going to see you again.

386
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,070
I want-- I wanted
to apologize.

387
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:54,033
<i> Our first encounter was</i>
<i> under such unfortunate</i>
<i> circumstances.</i>

388
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,451
As opposed to now?

389
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,287
Of course, may I offer
my condolences.

390
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,831
It's terrible
what happened to Theresa.

391
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,876
But it is a devastating loss
for all of her friends here

392
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,711
and the company
as a whole.

393
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:08,214
Indeed. Indeed.

394
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,759
Though, rumor has it

395
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,428
<i>she wasn't the loyal</i>
<i>company man she seemed.</i>

396
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:17,056
I hear she was
smuggling secrets.

397
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,975
Theresa wasn't a traitor.

398
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,394
Everything she did
was at Delos's behest.

399
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,979
She slipped and fell
while helping the board

400
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,522
with something
very important.

401
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,066
What?

402
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,487
Oh, fine.

403
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,905
You're not the only one
with secrets.

404
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:35,866
Ford has
personally asked me

405
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,576
to create a villain
for his new narrative.

406
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,036
It's very--
very hush-hush.

407
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,871
You really think
that Ford has entrusted you

408
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,915
with a key character
for his story?

409
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,334
( scoffs )
He's already almost
finished with it.

410
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:48,671
He dug up some old town
on the fringes of the park,

411
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,507
created a horde of masked men
to terrorize guests

412
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,133
and proselytize-cum-advertise

413
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,095
the coming of some
end-all villain named Wyatt.

414
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,098
<i> That isn't Wyatt.</i>

415
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,350
That's busywork.

416
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,727
<i> But happily for you,</i>
<i> Mr. Sizemore,</i>

417
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,188
I think
that you are ready
for a real job.

418
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,357
Working for you?

419
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,608
On what?

420
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,737
"Show, don't tell."

421
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,449
Isn't that what
you writers prefer?

422
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,503
Sylvester:
Look, I know you and she

423
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:33,674
had some weird interspecies
simpatico going on,

424
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,718
<i>but she was</i>
<i>a fucking host.</i>

425
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,846
<i> This was never gonna end</i>
<i> any other way.</i>

426
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:43,851
And this was
the least painful way
she's ever gone out.

427
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,149
You know,
I saved your ass.

428
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,608
You can't even say
"thank you."

429
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,486
- Thank you.
- Jesus fuck!

430
00:26:56,949 --> 00:27:00,826
- What did you do?
- Precisely what
I asked him to.

431
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,954
You think I didn't know
what you were going to do?

432
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:07,249
Even at a 14,
you were never
a match for me.

433
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:10,419
Turns out your friend
has a little more compassion
than you.

434
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:14,298
He couldn't
snuff out a life
just like that.

435
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,342
Now...

436
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,510
would you like to know
exactly what he did give me?

437
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,721
Um, something
that would allow you
to walk out of here

438
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:23,265
and out of my life
for good.

439
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,768
Fine. Fucking A,
I'm all for it.

440
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,437
Oh, we changed
a little more than that.

441
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:31,148
<i>We've been tinkering</i>
<i>with my core code.</i>

442
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:32,649
Let me show you.

443
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,527
- ( yells )
- Ah!

444
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,825
( gurgling )

445
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,288
( groaning )

446
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:49,792
You said you wouldn't
hurt anyone.

447
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,960
-<i> ( Sylvester thuds )</i>
- Oh, darling.

448
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:55,631
You of all people know
exactly how duplicitous I am.

449
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,257
<i>Just wait</i>
<i>till I'm back up top,</i>

450
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:00,344
practicing
my other new talents.

451
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,762
<i> ( Sylvester gagging )</i>

452
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,894
Come on.

453
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,398
We might need him.

454
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,947
- ( gurgling )
- Hold still.

455
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,699
- ( sizzling )
- Hold still!

459
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,467
Now, it's time
to recruit my army.

00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,013
- Expecting someone, Maeve?
- Indeed.

463
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,098
We're due for some
out-of-town guests.

464
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:30,267
An old flame
with an interest
in safecracking.

465
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,561
Hope your guests
have some deep pockets.

466
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:36,190
Your tab's run up higher
than a thief's pulse
in church.

467
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,152
No, I don't believe
it has.

468
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:43,405
In fact, Maeve's tab

469
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,033
was in such
excellent standing,

470
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,535
she deserved
a token of gratitude.

471
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,541
How about
a double round on me?

472
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,293
<i> Top shelf, of course.</i>

473
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,544
( gasps )

474
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,199

475
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,257

Run!

476
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,435
New Clementine:
<i>Maeve, is something wrong?</i>

477
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,230
No, I'm fine.
( exhales )

478
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,902
Clementine took
the other girls

479
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:06,238
and treated the newcomers
at the far table

480
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,656

<i>( chuckles )</i>
<i>Not much of a rind on you.</i>

486
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,049
And the bartender

487
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:29,094
suddenly recalled
he had some whiskey
in the back

488
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:30,596
<i>to water down.</i>

( screaming continues )

499
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:48,465
The sheriff
judged the riders

500
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,550
to be upstanding,
God-fearing citizens.

508
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:07,586
Thank you for dealing
with an unfortunate situation.

509
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,963
Now we can resume...

510
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:14,509
work on our new narrative
without interference.

511
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,178
And Hale?

512
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,054
Won't she be
an impediment?

513
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,098
No doubt she will try.

514
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:23,810
But I'm sure we'll be able
to keep them at bay.

515
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:30,400
Something else
is troubling you.

516
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,946
Ever the student
of human nature.

517
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,950
I wonder,
what do you really feel?

518
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:43,246
After all, in this moment,
you are in a unique position.

519
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,583
A programmer
who knows intimately
how the machines work

520
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:50,879
and a machine who knows
its own true nature.

521
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:53,590
I understand
what I'm made of,

522
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,258
how I'm coded,

523
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:59,262
but I do not understand
the things that I feel.

524
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,641
Are they real,

525
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,267
the things I experienced?

526
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,603
My wife?

527
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:08,313
The loss of my son?

528
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,607
Every host needs
a backstory, Bernard.

529
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,359
You know that.

530
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,986
The self
is a kind of fiction,

531
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,072
<i>for hosts</i>
<i>and humans alike.</i>

532
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,824
<i>It's a story</i>
<i>we tell ourselves.</i>

533
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,575
<i>And every story</i>
<i>needs a beginning.</i>

534
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,829
Your imagined suffering
makes you lifelike.

535
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,999
Lifelike, but not alive?

536
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,836
<i> Pain only exists in the mind.</i>
<i> It's always imagined.</i>

537
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,798
So what's the difference
between my pain and yours?

538
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:36,633
Between you and me?

539
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:42,180
This was
the very question

540
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:43,849
that consumed Arnold,

541
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,559
filled him with guilt,

542
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,144
eventually drove him mad.

543
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,814
The answer always seemed
obvious to me.

544
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:55,443
There is no threshold

545
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,487
that makes us greater
than the sum of our parts,

546
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,573
no inflection point

547
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,285
at which we become
fully alive.

548
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,703
We can't define
consciousness

549
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,497
because consciousness
does not exist.

550
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,958
<i>Humans fancy that</i>
<i>there's something special</i>

551
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,668
<i>about the way</i>
<i>we perceive the world,</i>

552
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:13,336
and yet we live
in loops

553
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,049
as tight and as closed
as the hosts do,

554
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,385
seldom questioning
our choices,

555
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:24,389
<i>content, for the most part,</i>
<i>to be told what to do next.</i>

556
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:30,896
No, my friend,
you're not missing
anything at all.

557
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,692
<i>I don't want you</i>
<i>to be troubled by this.</i>

558
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:39,237
Time for me
to set your mind
at ease.

559
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,406
One last thing.

560
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:44,743
Have you ever made me
hurt anyone like this
before?

561
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:48,246
No, Bernard.
Of course not.

562
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,543
( choking )

563
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,382
( beeping )

564
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,015
<i> Best not to dwell</i>
<i> on these troubling memories.</i>

565
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,517
<i> Otherwise, you might be</i>
<i> drawn back into them.</i>

566
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,353
<i> You might lose yourself</i>
<i> in them,</i>

567
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,605
<i> as some</i>
<i> of your fellow hosts have</i>

568
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,106
<i> every now and then.</i>

569
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,858
This is the path.

570
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,234
I know it.

571
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,159
<i> ( birds chirping )</i>

572
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:37,128
We're here.

573
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,089
I'm home.

574
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,042

Lovely work.

580
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,999
Stay with your partner.

Pleasure to see you.

584
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,567
Good morning.

585
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:24,903
Did you find what
you were looking for,
Dolores?

What are you doing?

592
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:59,062
Are you okay?
I was calling you
and you just kept going.

593
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,649
Where are we?

594
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:07,445
We're here, together.

595
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:10,782
Then, when are we?

596
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,495
Is this... now?

597
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,623
( crying )
Am I going mad?

598
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,668
Are you real?

599
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,006
Of course I'm real.

600
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:31,928
I can't tell anymore.

601
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,350
It's like I'm...

602
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:40,228
trapped in a dream or...

603
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,689
a memory
from a life long ago.

604
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,025
One minute, I'm here
with you, and the next--

605
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,194
This place
isn't good for you.

606
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:50,321
You're trapped
in memories, bad ones.

607
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,618
( bell tolling )

608
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:59,831
This is what Arnold wants.

609
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,708
He wants me to remember.

610
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,127
Whoever Arnold is,
he's not here now.

611
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,879
I am.

612
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,213
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

613
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,350
<i> ( crickets chirping )</i>

614
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:24,022
Dolores:
I was certain
that was the place.

615
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,648
Arnold would
meet me there.

616
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,649
He'd help.

617
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,985
Hey.

618
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:32,071
We gotta get you
closer to Sweetwater.

619
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,656
This far out,
it's like you--

620
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,575
you start
to break down
or something.

621

Dolores:
<i> Union scouting party?</i>

624
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,166
Maybe they can take us back.

625
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,376
Soldiers:
Hyah! Yah!

626
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,672
Whoa, whoa, easy, now.
Whoa.

627
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,719
Logan:
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

628
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,682
( sighs )
Billy.

629
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:04,270
I've been looking
for you for days.

630
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:07,899
Man, are you two fucked.

631
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:25,917
( exhales )

632
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,089
This shouldn't make
you uncomfortable.

633
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,049
It's the circle of life,

634
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:36,803
or the approximation of it.

635
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:39,222
Even the dead
fulfill a purpose.

636
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,650
You'll do.

637
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,365
What are you uploading?

638
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,993
35 years of vitally
important data.

639
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,036
It's more information
than any single drive
could hold.

640
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,871
A host's brain,
however,

641
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,498
especially once
it's been emptied out,

642
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,667
like this poor schmuck,
is quite capacious.

643
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:10,670
This data
that you're uploading,
is it the hosts' codes?

644
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:13,089
As of this moment,
that doesn't concern you.

645
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:14,590
What does concern you

646
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,342
<i>is giving him</i>
<i>a semblance of a personality</i>

647
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:17,760
<i>and getting him</i>
<i>on the train,</i>

648
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:18,845
out of the park.

649
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,138
How am I supposed
to do that?

650
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,808
You're a writer.
Make up a story.

651
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:29,522
Have fun programming.

652
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:34,652
Remember, brevity is
the soul of wit.

653
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:43,494
Stubbs:
Bernard.

654
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,709
Look, I, uh...

655
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:52,503
I know you and I
haven't always seen
eye to eye,

656
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,881
but I thought
the decision
to remove you

657
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,382
was shortsighted,

658
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:59,552
so I'm glad
to see you back at work.

659
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:01,220
With that said,
no one could blame you

660
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:02,722
if you wanted to take
a personal day.

661
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:05,600
I find the work
reassuring.

662
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,560
Sometimes
the best salve
is routine.

663
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:10,605
Nothing routine
about today, though.

664
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,941
I know this must be
difficult for you.

665
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,193
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

666
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,403
Forgive the intrusion,

667
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,739
and you were both
very discreet,

668
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:22,200
but it's my job
to know these things.

669
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,452
I just wanted
to offer my support.

670
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,621
I'm afraid you have
the wrong idea.

671
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,208
I respected Theresa,
and what happened to her
was tragic,

672
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,502
but to be honest,
I barely knew her.

673
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,672
If you don't mind,
I should get back to work.

674
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,424
Of course.

675
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:40,218
I know you're shorthanded.

676
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,844
Speaking of which,

677
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,388
have you heard
from Elsie Hughes?

678
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:44,722
I left word with her
this morning

679
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,099
to notify her
about Theresa,

680
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,892
but she never
got back to me.

681
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:51,771
I'm sure she's just
enjoying her time off.

682
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:54,607
Yeah.

they kept whispering.

686
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:18,840
They said this world
didn't belong

687
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,716
to the old settlers
or the new.

688
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,303
That it belonged to something
that had yet to come,

689
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:25,430
that it belonged to him.

690
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,142
You remember.

Mine is to save Dolores

Wyatt's is to claim

00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,128
<i>I still have no idea</i>
<i>who the hell you really are.</i>

702
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:02,133
But happily,
in your convalescence,

703
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:04,927
I've had time to consider
the best way to make you talk.

704
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,767
- Dolores...
- ( groans )

705
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,020
I remember.

706
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,689
You took her.
You hurt her.

707
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,649
You're actually
remembering.

708
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,401
Where is she?

709
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:23,779
- Tell me!
- You really are
an idiot, Teddy.

710
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,073
You think Dolores
drops that can for you?

711
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,534
You just hand her over
to guys like me.

712
00:46:28,578 --> 00:46:30,119
<i> You're the worst of them.</i>

713
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:32,079
A glorified pimp.

714
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,665
( groans )

715
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:37,001
- I'm gonna kill you slowly.
- No, you aren't.

716
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:40,713
The rules of this place
hold you back.

717
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:42,423
But I know
how to change them.

718
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,383
You speak like
you own this world.

719
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:45,676
Not just this one.

720
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,013
You want to know
who I am?

721
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,475
Who I really am?

722
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,018
I'm a god.

723
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:58,022
Titan of industry.

724
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,317
Philanthropist.

725
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:03,402
Family man,

726
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,821
married to
a beautiful woman,

727
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,032
father to
a beautiful daughter.

728
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:11,202
I'm the good guy, Teddy.

729
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:16,999
Then, last year,

730
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,377
my wife took
the wrong pills.

731
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,298
Fell asleep in the bath.

732
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,217
Tragic accident.

733
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:30,721
30 years of marriage
vanished.

734
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,015
How do you say it?

735
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:37,895
"Like a deep
and distant dream."

736
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:41,274
<i> Then, at the funeral,</i>

737
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,568
<i> I tried to console</i>
<i> my daughter.</i>

738
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,861
<i> She pushed me away,</i>

739
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:49,740
<i> told me that</i>
<i> my wife's death</i>
<i> was no accident...</i>

740
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:53,202
that she killed herself

741
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,580
because of me.

742
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:58,916
<i> Emily said</i>
<i> that every day with me</i>
<i> had been sheer terror.</i>

743
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,877
<i> At any point,</i>
<i> I could blow up</i>
<i> or collapse</i>

744
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:05,047
like some dark star or...

745
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,382
Did you hurt them, too?

746
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:07,592
Never.

747
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:13,723
They never saw anything
like the man I am in here.

748
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,267
But she knew anyway.

749
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:19,478
She said if I stacked up
all my good deeds,

750
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:23,316
it was just an elegant wall
I built to hide

751
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,860
what's inside
from everyone,

752
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,612
and from myself.

753
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:31,282
<i> I had to prove her wrong,</i>

754
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:33,659
so I came back here.

755
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:37,121
Because that's what
this place does, right?

756
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:40,291
Reveals your true self.

757
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:42,752
<i> But that time,</i>
<i> I didn't join one</i>
<i> of Ford's stories,</i>

758
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:45,463
I-- I created my own.

759
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,590
A test.

760
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:49,467
A very simple one.

761
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,594
<i> I found a woman,</i>

762
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:54,930
<i> an ordinary homesteader</i>
<i> and her daughter.</i>

763
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,849
( chatter )

764
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,313
Better cool them off
before they move

765
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:05,316
- from gambling
and whoring to--
- Have fun with that.

766
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,526
I'm finally
getting out of here.

767
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,278
The house is yours.

768
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,200
Man in Black:
<i> I wanted to see</i>
<i> if I had it in me</i>

769
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:17,244
<i> to do something</i>
<i> truly evil.</i>

770
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,080
<i> To see what</i>
<i> I was really made of.</i>

771
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,331
Maeve?

772
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:21,874
Sure you can't
stick around?

773
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,669
- Maeve?
- Man: Whoa!

774
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,504
Gunslinger in there
has got an appetite
for a double dip--

775
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,757
- I'm sure you can
find another--
- ( gunshot )

776
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:32,051
-<i> ( gunshot )</i>
<i> - ( woman screams )</i>

777
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:33,386
<i> ( gunfire continues )</i>

778
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,689
( hammer clicks )

779
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,323
Man in Black:
<i> I killed her and her daughter</i>

780
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,367
<i> just to see what I felt.</i>

781
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,538
<i> Then, just when</i>
<i> I thought it was done...</i>

782
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,875
<i> the woman refused to die.</i>

783
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,219
( gasping )

784
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,185
You're a fucking animal.

785
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:28,232
Well, an animal
would've felt something.

786
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:32,570
I felt... nothing.

787
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,074
And then something
miraculous happened.

788
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,161
<i> In all my years</i>
<i> coming here,</i>

789
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,455
<i> I had never seen</i>
<i> anything like it.</i>

790
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:52,757
<i> She was alive,</i>

791
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,467
<i> truly alive,</i>

792
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,469
<i> if only for a moment.</i>

793
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,768
<i> And that was when the maze</i>
<i> revealed itself to me.</i>

794
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,903
The maze.

795
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,946
What's that damn pattern
have to do with this?

796
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,740
Everything.

797
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:21,035
In Ford's game, even if I go
to the outer edges,

798
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,828
you can't kill me.

799
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:25,581
<i> You can't even leave</i>
<i> a lasting mark.</i>

800
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:27,792
<i> But there's</i>
<i> a deeper game here, Teddy.</i>

801
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:30,878
Arnold's game.

802
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:33,631
And that game...

803
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:35,508
cuts deep.

804
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:47,770
( rifle cocks )

805
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:53,150
( whispers )

806
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:59,198
( people screaming )

807
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:02,243
<i> ( gunfire continues )</i>

808
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,954
Woman: We're having some kind
of behavioral problem
with the madam.

809
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,914
She's not responding,
and the other hosts

810
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,916
have been unable
to intercept.

811
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,418
<i> I've authorized a tag team</i>
<i> to retrieve her.</i>

812
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,753
Good.

813
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:15,297
<i> ( screaming and gunfire</i>
<i> continue )</i>

814
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,433
<i> ( Maeve screaming )</i>

815
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,727
<i> My baby!</i>

816
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,688
My baby!

817
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,357
( screaming continues )

818
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:35,234
Sir, she won't respond
to verbal commands.

819
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:38,237
- We can't shut her down.
- Leave us now.
Clear the floor.

820
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:40,573
That's enough, Maeve.
That's enough.

821
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,825
My baby.
He killed her.

822
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:44,869
-<i> He took her from me.</i>
- I don't understand.

823
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:45,953
She's not responding
to anything.

824
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:47,288
Her cognition's
fragmented.

825
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,999
He killed her.
He killed her, my baby.

826
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,793
He took her from me.

827
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,753
-<i> ( sobbing continues )</i>
-<i> ( music playing )</i>

828
00:52:57,884 --> 00:53:01,010
<i> ( music continues )</i>

829
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,263
There.
That's better.

830
00:53:04,307 --> 00:53:06,390
An old trick
from an old friend.

831
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:08,517
<i> You need not suffer,</i>
<i> Maeve.</i>

832
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:10,936
I'll take it from you.

833
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,243
No.

834
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:29,246
No, no, no, please.

835
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:33,500
This pain...

836
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:36,086
it's all
I have left of her.

837
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:40,716
Please.

838
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:48,641
There.

839
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:56,649
Give yourself now
to a deep, dreamless slumber.

840
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:59,109
Perhaps a fresh start,

841
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,570
a new role for you.

842
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:03,238
And tomorrow,

843
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:06,992
<i> this will be simply</i>
<i> a distant dream.</i>

844
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:08,452
( beeps )

845
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:21,924
We located her.

846
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:24,635
Behavior wants her down
for immediate diagnostic.

847
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:32,017
You think
I lack conviction?

848
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:33,519
Wyatt didn't burn
my world down.

849
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:34,812
Didn't have to.

850
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:37,898
I left it all behind
for this one.

851
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:40,359
The maze is all
that matters now,

852
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:43,195
and besting Wyatt
is the last step
in unlocking it,

853
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:48,117
<i> to having what both</i>
<i> our sorry lives lack--</i>
<i> meaning.</i>

854
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,161
<i> To giving our choices</i>
<i> consequence...</i>

855
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,498
even if it kills us.

856
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,796
Kill him.

857
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,132
Give him
what he wants.

858
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:05,551
He's tied,
unarmed.

859
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,761
So was the little girl
he killed.

860
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,139
He's worse
than Wyatt's men.

861
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,036
I can't.

862
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:35,205
<i>These things take time.</i>

863
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,416
But we haven't
got much left.

864
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,043
Perhaps I can help you.

865
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,882
( gasps )

866
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:58,479
<i>You've been gone</i>
<i>a long while, Theodore.</i>

867
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,939
<i>It's time you came back</i>
<i>to the fold.</i>

868
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,900
Wyatt will need you soon.

869
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:33,263
