1
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,560
For a handful of onion

2
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,500
Translation and adaptation: RRZXXX

3
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,200
Look, that turned three.

4
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,640
It is rumored that they had brought
wood to dig my husband.

5
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,120
Look it, bastards.

6
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,880
Is what they're up to
this time?

7
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,960
Now the whole earth
belongs to Mr. Lamb.

8
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,080
There remained only Foster's farm.

9
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,000
- Let us help you?
- Get out. Forget it.

10
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,280
Poisoning the wells this area
fucking oil.

11
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,000
Foster tried to
humanly understand us with you

12
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,280
But it seems that you do not want to understand,
the worse for you.

13
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,480
Why do not we have heard, Foster?

14
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,080
What, you afraid?

15
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,480
I had to teach you mind first.

16
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,360
An ideal place
an accident, right?

17
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,480
- Yes, not bad.
- Courage, give him a nudge.

18
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,360
Goes the last farmer.

19
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,440
Gentlemen, our company will become
largest in the country,

20
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,040
because oil is about
to become the most used

21
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,360
Future raw material and
then animal traction

22
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,320
will be replaced completely
internal combustion engine.

23
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,880
Humanity can no longer
do anything without oil.

24
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,360
So strong is the oil gentlemen.

25
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,320
Power that will rule the world.

26
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,560
In this country under the feet
our

27
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,640
is the largest reservoir
crude oil in the world.

28
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,600
Who will be with us well.
Who will be against us, eh ...

29
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,240
So gentlemen we have control
this region.

30
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,240
One moment Mr. Lamb.

31
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,320
Forgot to mention the
land of Paradise City.

32
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,440
My knowledge, there
still be problems.

33
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Yes, yes ...
Paradise City, yes.

34
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
But that's not a problem at all.

35
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,440
Just a little misunderstanding
a farmer.

36
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,440
A man named Foster.

37
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
I had small problems in trying

38
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,560
buying
piece of land.

39
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,440
As you can see land
which already belong to the company

40
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,240
are marked in gray

41
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,520
and this piece is still green
land we are talking about.

42
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,640
- Mr. Lamb!
- Yes?

43
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,800
- A telegram from Paradise City
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

44
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,680
Gentlemen, I am informed that the d
Foster landowner

45
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,440
the victim
an unfortunate accident.

46
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,720
I can say that from this moment
problem in Paradise City

47
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,560
can be considered solved.

48
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,640
And this ...

49
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,920
Somebody help me ..

50
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,160
But you said
this was blocked?

51
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,640
Yes, but the situation is that now
My finger was stuck.

52
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,720
I need help ..
Help!

53
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,000
Finish with the wail
and get to work.

54
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,240
Are you sure the problem is as
Mr. Lamb addressed? Because ...

55
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,640
- Hey Jack, where to stop?
- We stop at least the bar.

56
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,520
I have a dry throat.

57
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,640
Onion .. ! Onion .. !
We're here!

58
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,000
Bar .. !

59
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,680
Just what I needed, a glass,
a bath and a hearty meal.

60
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,480
And a sexy mare for me.

61
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,880
Horatio, you always
want the same thing.

62
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,600
You wait here and make sure you
not steal anyone onions.

63
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,680
Listen, I'm horse
no cart horse guard.

64
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,000
Hello!

65
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,680
Apparently does not like
conversation. Too bad.

66
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,440
- Tears, why are you crying?
- But why are you crying?

67
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,000
I do not know, but suddenly I
began to feel very sad.

68
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,880
What the hell did
whiskey this from the onion?

69
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,880
- Mr bartender!
- Hey, buddy, what do you serve?

70
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,800
- A glass, please.
- A glass of what?

71
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,400
Gol, please.

72
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,000
Sorry, I can say as
Foster firm's reach?

73
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,680
What job do you have
Foster's farm?

74
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,560
I mean the former land
Foster's.

75
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,280
Now the farm is mine.
I bought it.

76
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,280
He bought it.
Foster's farm.

77
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,440
Why laugh? There is good ground
for onions grown?

78
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,400
He wants to grow onions!

79
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,400
What you have with onions?
Good for health.

80
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Look, if S

a tragic end.

Why do not you see your affairs.

102
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,720
- A Pulitzer was an accident.
- Who says it was an accident?

103
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,400
- Come on, everybody knows.
- Everyone knows?

104
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,880
Of course.
Look! It was an accident.

105
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,800

Next time do not lose

112
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,880
Hey.

113
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,840
- Are you looking for someone.
- Who?

114
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,200
- Well, I.
- Who? You?

115
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,960
Hold on boys at a time.
You go.

- Yes. I think so.

121
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,800
- On your feet!
- Hey, be careful.

122
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,000
You think we fear you with that?

123
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,000
Now what?

124
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,760
- Come, lead you back home.

Hey, ceparule, how are you?

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,000
Pay attention son, you better leave him
alone. It's a great villain.

129
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,840
Let's go.

130
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,000
No, just play, joking.
Wait for me outside, right?

131
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,960
Whatever.

132
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,480
- So, onions or gun?
- Gun.

133
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,000
No onions.
Not one but 2, 3, 4 onions ...

134
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,520
The eye is quick but hand
is even faster ..

135
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,360
Now, attention onions disappear
each remaining onions ...

136
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,280

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,880
Pistol!

139
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,720
Now be careful ..
Two onions, a gun ..

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
Two onions, a gun ..
Remove onions and bag guns ..

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,600
There are three guns now
Beware of guns ...

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,800
Four guns ..
Now be careful ..

143
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,680
The gun is made onion ..

Look at the guns,
Beware of onion, 1 2 3 4 ...

And 4 3 2 1 .. Gun spinning,

146
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,440
I told you to watch onions.

147
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,280
We arrived.

148
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,080
I live here and work here.

149
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,360
No big deal that job
but that housing is worse.

150
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
Please come.

151
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,360
Well, to be ...

152
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,280
But .. this is a printing,
so they say no?

153
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,000
- Here is printed newspapers ..
- Yes .. is printed here.

154
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,680
Only that in this town newspaper
no one reads it.

155
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,480
You see, O people
afraid to know the truth.

156
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,480
My newspaper is censored, burned.

157
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,680
The only things that are left
them are printed obituaries

158
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,280
publicity and advertising
the funeral.

159
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,080
The names of all those
read newspaper obituaries occur.

160
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,600
Sorry, but we still do not
we became acquainted.

161
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,480
I called my Pulitzer
Henry J. Pulitzer.

162
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,880
Jack for friends.

163
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,600
I am editor, director,
printer and reporter.

164
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,480
But unfortunately the only reader
of the newspapers in town.

165
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Glad to meet you,
I'm Onion (Onion).

166
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,840
- Onion? Onion and how?
- Onion and nothing more.

167
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,240
I never never knew his father.

168
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,600
- I'm sorry ..
- Why, you know?

169
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,560
Finally you get home father.

170
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,640
But what's that smell
strong onions.

171
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,560
To be honest I do not know.

172
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,800
The smell comes from me ..

173
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,640
.. comes only from me ..

174
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,680
If I could see was
this place before, Onion ..

175
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,560
Once this place
was a small paradise

176
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,840
and would have remained a small town
peaceful farmers.

177
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,800
Everything changed when they discovered
that the area is full of oil.

178
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,880
A handful of people took
control of the city.

179
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,560
Many fled the city,
and those who remained

180
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,720
died in mysterious circumstances.

181
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,720
Onion, what do you think of
oil industry?

182
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,640
- It's wonderful.
- What is beautiful?

183
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,760
What? Mind
if you repeat the question?

184
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,640
Forget it, eat, let's courage!
Eat as it cools.

185
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,680
It's under your plate.

186
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,680
True.

187
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,640
Miss Mary Ann,

188
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,760
No .. no .. no .. I love that smell.

189
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,760
- Really?
- Yes ..

190
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,760
No .. get both.

191
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
It's good, is not it?

192
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,840
He gave it ready.

193
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,480
Look Horatio, the .. !

194
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,760
Thank God!

195
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,760
That you gave me to see land
which I dreamed all my life.

196
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,760
Here my onions
can love and multiply.

197
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,760
A tit ...

198
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,760
Hey!

199
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,760
- Onion ...

200
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,840
I go, telling me later
to me who won.

201
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,760
Do not move, stay away!
Raise your hands!

202
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,760
Drop your weapons.
Now lift your feet!

203
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,760
I said standing.

204
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,760
Look, I am standing.

205
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,800
Return slowly!

206
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,600
****************************
Which of you fired?

207
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,600
- I.
- With that?

208
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,600
- Yes.
- Who threw the bombs?

209
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,480
Where do you steal?

210
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,600
I have not stolen. We make it.

211
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,600
So you will encounter neighbors?

212
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,200
Father trust
neighbors, and finally to the cemetery.

213
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,600
Your father?

214
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,600
Foster told me that not having children.

215
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,600
I am Cal. Caligola Foster
Nerone and he is my brother.

216
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,800
I am the Onion.
It's nice to meet you.

217
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,800
Nerone come to make peace.

218
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,680
Caligola and Nerone ...

219
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,280
Father knew how
you play?

220
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,080
Now you are convinced that the father
I sold your land?

221
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,000
Yes it's true. It's written and
father's signature.

222
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,960
- Your brother has doubts?
- He does not know how to read.

223
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,560
Listen guys, my father
sold this land two months ago.

224
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,760
And I made him promise
not to give it the petroleum industry.

225
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,840
I promise I will keep this.

226
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,840
Now that they killed
do not know where to go.

227
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,840
- Why are you sure you killed?
- Are safe and ready.

228
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,800
You do not have anyone to
take care of you? Any relative?

229
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,680
I have it on Nerone and Nerone
I have myself,

230
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,800
and on our land
we do not go.

231
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,440
Look What's up guys, I
I gave all my savings

232
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,000
your father in exchange for
land, you understand?

233
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,840
- $ 236.50, is not it?
- That's right

234
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,680
- These are?
- Yes, I even mine.

235
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,800
- I recognize by smell.
- Okay.

236
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,800
Take your money and your piece of the cart
and disappear.

237
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,720
No, that's not correct.

238
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,040
If planting fast
lost harvest onions.
6

239
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,800
And I have no money
fertilizer.

240
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,200
You should make a loan.

241
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:33,840
- And who gives a loan?
- Okay, so we associate.

242
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,680
You two put money
and I land.

243
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Profit share,
agree boys?

244
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,000
One hand washes the other ...
But we work together.

245
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,840
All right.

246
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,800
Of course he was assassinated.

247
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,680
Poor, was found dead
off a cliff, a few days ago.

248
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,680
A sheriff said the accident.
But I have seen body

249
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,600
He had signs of violence on the body
and the gap was far

250
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,680
the earth's.
What to look for him there?

251
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,760
And you suspect that you threw?

252
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,680
You can be sure that one
not been discarded.

253
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,840
And of course they are not evidence.

254
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,160
The fact is that since they started
to pump that shit black

255
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,200
happened a lot of accidents.

256
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,800
And all were people who refused
Petrus Lamb to sell his land.

257
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,680
For example, Armstrong
which remained ...

258
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,800
- But it happens, right?
- So, in the middle of the desert?

259
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,760
It's too much coincidence.

260
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,680
Austin. John J. Austin,
Nello fugatto the Stagno.

261
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,880
There's even
to wash feet.

262
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,880
Taney, Taney old Bill,
lost his arm in the war

263
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,880
They said he committed suicide with
a blow to the head.

264
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,880
- Tempio E donkeys was sinister.
- I see you begin to understand.

265
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,920
Earth is just right
for my onions.

266
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,840
I go to register
the act of selling

267
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,680
Onion, if you stay you die
before the first harvest to gather.

268
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Listen to the advice of a friend
go, go until you can.

269
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,760
- Look, it e.
- Yes, sure. It's right at the bar.

270
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,920
While it is true that he
skirmished in all five?

271
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,880
Sure, well I saw with my own eyes.

272
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,880
- Look, what sin is so young.
- Yes, we had a hard life.

273
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,920
I would say very short.

274
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,800
Get ten men and

275
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,680
Paradise City no longer exist!

276
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,640
- What will be?
- Ride people

277
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,000
know that the sheriff does not want
assemblies on the corners.

278
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,480
- This is a quiet town
- Yes, quiet as a cemetery.

279
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,760
Onion, Drang Drang ...
Wake up!

280
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,680
Thank you, Horatio.

281
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,840
Hello. Is there a judge
these parts?

282
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,160

284
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,680

00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,400
Judge lives
the street.

286
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,560
It's a banner there, but I
doubt that you read.

287
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,680
Oh, it's a signboard.

- Birth?
- Not my son, to death.

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,240

320
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,440

- I will deal personally.
- Attention to toe.

333
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,880
That should do.

334
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,720

And hurry up before

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,760
- Just the act of selling and ready
-

349
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,800
Poor has already begun
to speak alone.

350
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,720
Yes, as may
so as possible.

351
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,720
If I do not do justice ..

352
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,760
- What a shame.
- Yes That's right

353
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,760
I deserve to end up so bad.

354
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,240
- You wait here.
- It depends.

355
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,760
- Where's the sheriff?
- Inside.

356
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,960
- Mr Judge Logan, hello!
- Sssstt!

357
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,080
- Just trying to ..
- Ssssssssstt!

358
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,920
So ...

359
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,760
I was stolen document
ownership of land.

360
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,280
- Can you prove?
- Sure Sheriff.

361
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:22,240
Judge Logan saw him,
Come tell your honor.

362
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,080
Your recorded this
act Mr. Judge?

363
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,240
No, I do not I seen
this guy does not know anything.

364
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,480
- But .. but ..
- Ceparule not move!

365
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:37,800
You never got better, and I see that
behave like a boor.

366
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,800
- Searched it!
- Welcome.

367
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,360
How much onion ...

368
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,360
Look ..

369
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,680
Now you burned ..

370
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,600
Ceparule Remember, if you see my
it will be the last time.

371
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,880
I was told that this
is a nice town.

372
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,960
Not notice anything strange?

373
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,800
Who stole my wagon wheels?

374
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,080
Can you prove that you had
when you arrived?

375
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,400
- Good day asshole.
- Attention to speed.

376
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,000
Now it was angry.

377
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,400
Are you hurt?

378
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,400
I told you to watch your step.

379
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,960
- Does it hurt?
- Want to Mom?

380
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,080
Get him!

381
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Now give me back wheels
and contract.

382
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,320
So I'm not angry, number 3.

383
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,640
If you were smart
guarding your back, buddy.

384
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,280
Seriously?
Really, what's wrong?

385
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,360
- To know is right.
- What?

386
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,800
Return
and look to see.

387
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,280
Bella Trech, Stechinetti and
M.

388
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,000
What do you do, laugh?

389
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,240
Give me the gun with repetition.

390
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,040
- And what you did with the pipe?
- Yes, there is no pipe ..

391
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:35,600
You see sir, one day ...
a calf annoyed me, and I ...

392
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:40,000
I think he left ..
I'm going to see!

393
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,280
Wait! Hold it!

394
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,600
END PART

395
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,800
PART TWO

396
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,720
At the station, quick!

397
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,800
Horatio! Horatio, you?

398
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,800
- Who else is?
- Hello, Horatio!

399
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,480
- How did you find?
-

400
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,400
- Where did you get the wheels?
-

401
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,560
Me when I fall in head an idea
Need to plant to sow.

402
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,120
I did a lot of things.
Courage, let's go home.

403
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,520
-
-

404
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,520
- Look sexy e.
- What?

405
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,520
How what?

406
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,520
First work then pleased.
Let's go!

407
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,400
With you all the time only working
with pleasure what about?

408
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,600
Do not get older the difference
between a cow and a mare.

409
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:52,520
Are you sure that
Onion can rub?

410
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,720
Hello Mr. Lamb!

411
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,320
Mr. Lamb has come!

412
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,720
Welcome to Mr. Lamb!

413
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,920
Welcome to Mr. Lamb!

414
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,720
What do you think our wonderful
Paradise City?

415
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,800
Abominable, nor can
breathe so much dust!

416
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,920
Benjamin, my phalanx ..
Benjamin, hurry up.

417
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,880
I will provide
best room in the hotel!

418
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,800
Petrus Lamb has everything
available.

419
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,800
But all other rooms
are occupied Mr. Lamb!

420
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:37,480
Yes, yes, I understand, if all
rooms are occupied when ..

421
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,760
Benjamin I get sick ..

422
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,520
All rooms in the hotel boys
are busy! Dezocupati them!

423
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,480
You build a casino.

424
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,480
Ocupaatt!

425
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,360
- Shower me!
- There she is!

426
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,000
Benjamin, my finger.

427
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,680
I put them all in a bag
and I connected.

428
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,480
Then I saw some 500
that surrounded me.

429
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,600
Then I beat all 500 ..

430
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,280
Then another 500 have tried to
attack from behind the back,

431
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:42,320
three-meter tall giants,
and then ...

432
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,560
I stole the title deeds.

433
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,880
And now of course
employers you are.

434
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,920
I do not have any reason to remain.

435
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,000
You said something?

436
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,800
Then ... I can go.

437
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,320
I saw the contract,
I shook hands ..

438
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,160
and a man of honor
Keep the promise.

439
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,720
I knew they could not find two
associates better than you!

440
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,760
Thanks!
Caligola Thanks!

441
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:38,280
Thank Nerone, sleeping!
Come, you go to bed.

442
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:44,200
Bondarel dear sleep,
Nani do baby.

443
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:49,400
To dream of angels.

444
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,720
- Ssssstt!
- Shhh ...

445
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,720
Ms. Pulitzer.

446
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,400
Ms. Pulitzer. I am ..
I .. so ..

447
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,000
So powerful.

448
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,120
I .. Once I fought a bull
empty-handed,

449
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,240
and I hit
fist full force ..

450
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,200
And .. and ..

451
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,000
But you're looking for
here so late?

452
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:55,080
Dad had talked to someone
now it's dark

453
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,920
I can walk around town without
I see people Mr. Lamb.

454
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,600
- I'm going to wake him Horatio.
- No. .. no ..

455
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,720
Do not bother anyway
everyone sleeps in the city.

456
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:12,600
It's so good here, and out
full moon is so beautiful.

457
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,840
And then it's the first time
I got the opportunity to remain single,

458
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,800
And I missed
little conversation.

459
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:24,840
Actually I'm not too talkative,
Miss Miriam.

460
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,200
Say the first thing that
will think of.

461
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,320
Onions .. Then ..

462
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,000
My onion seed is one of
the best in California.

463
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,640
- Seriously?
- Yes.

464
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,640
It's young, sweet and fragrant ..

465
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,320
Say ..

466
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:50,480
- And then there's the Russian Nebraska.
- How is the Russian Nebraska?

467
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:58,600
Exciting ... and spicy ..

468
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,920
And passionate ..

469
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,160
I was me, I would not allow
I swear .. I ..

470
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,520
I do not do stuff like that.

471
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,600
No, it is counterfeit ..

472
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,520
Seeing yourself
As you have skirmished

473
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,920
we realized
they are not invincible.

474
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,720
Onion, if you want to give you
one hand,

475
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,720
the whole town will be on your side.

476
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,120
- So you agree?
- It's true, you know.

477
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:33,120
Well .. I am pretty busy
sowing and is a lot of work.

478
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,640
Wait, what are you going to do?

479
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,720
I'm going to see what's up
and come back.

480
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,480
No, there is only one way
the sheriff's tops,

481
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,360
by Lamb and his murderers.

482
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,520
We need to find a single proof
about their illegality.

483
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,920
A story we published in Gazeta and will
reach the ears of the governor.

484
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,040
- But you do not have any proof?
- No, all they found something

485
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,480
ended at the cemetery
Remember that learning.

486
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,040
- Then let's see how do.
- Almost dawn.

487
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,120
- Hey Bob you started to cry.
- I console him immediately.

488
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:18,360
- Whose turn?
- Stink's turn, let's day!

489
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,480
Do not mumble, speak normally.

490
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,440
- Give drinking.
- Trying to get rid of remorse.

491
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,320
But Those bastards ...

492
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,520
So now ..

493
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,440
- Sheriff!
- What?

494
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,480
Type the onion returned
out and instigate people.

495
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,560
On my Indian law if you do not
finish guy.

496
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,720
- Ceparule, attention!
- Quiet!

497
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:01,400
You and your stupid rhymes.
Imbeciles, forgot orders?

498
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,520
Gentlemen, you must leave
before.

499
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,640
The best thing would be that
you three to disappear.

500
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,520
You will cross the border tomorrow.

501
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,640
Go up there and
stay there long.

502
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,600
- Let's go.
- Continue as planned.

503
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,400
I do not do poetry,
I have talent as a poet.

504
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,520
I'll try and judge
to solve personal

505
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,920
work with the guy
onions and two orphans.

506
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,000
- It's not that Mr. Judge?
- Ready to go,

507
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,280
I will not interfere in the affairs
voasre, handle your own.

508
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,520
Then I guess you have not heard
I said.

509
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,120
I said

510
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,400
ready

511
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,480
with

512
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,400
violence.

513
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,920
Do you understand?

514
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:51,400
To be legal guardian of children
I just need your signature.

515
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,400
Move .. !

516
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,120
Benjamin!

517
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,120
We do not want to go
the orphanage, Trofio.

518
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,400
We should thank Mr.
Lamb that is worried for you.

519
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,320
Everything is arranged at the expense
Oil company & Company.

520
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,520
You will like there children

To intercept them and to

01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,520
Eliminates hârþoagele this!

694
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:14,520
You make me to stop smoking.

695
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:24,520
- Ready! Reading banned.
- Get out of here.

696
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:53,640
I want all copies of the newspaper
to be burned right now.

697
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,640
Needless, Sheriff!

698
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:13,320
You want to destroy the papers, but
truth can not be hidden.

699
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,240
And what about the law, Sheriff?

700
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:46,600
One law matters, and
that's my gun!

701
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:50,600
Teach yourself ceparule.
You still have time.

702
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,880
You alone against all!

703
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,800
So I like.

704
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:04,800
- Onions or gun.
- Gun.

705
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,920
What was dressed sexy sheriff ..

706
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,920
- Stand still, stop.
- Freeze ceparule.

707
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,600
It's ours is ours.

708
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:10,520
Asshole. Cretins, idiots!

709
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,720
It's your fault!

710
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:21,640
It is useless to try to flee,
dude, stop or pull ..

711
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,640
Prepare for the worst.

712
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,640
- I give permission .. ?
- Who is it?

713
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:05,640
You are dear?

714
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,640
Even open.
Door .. !

715
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:28,600
- Hey, where are you going?
- At ..

716
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:57,640
How do you feel

717
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,400
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

718
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,600
I think that would be
better to go.

719
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,640
Let's go boys, take it easy not to
get out from the crowd.

720
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,600
Ajutooor!

721
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,320
Mr. Lamb!

722
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,640
Are you finished Mr. Lamb!

723
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:29,680
You only left hand gold
but it's good just to catch flies.

724
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:33,920
- You left all.
- Yes I was alone.

725
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:38,680
But in your place
I would not sing victory.

726
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:42,520
Now I was just us two.
To kill you would be a good idea

727
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,640
I would turn into a hero
and do not want to do that.

728
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,520
I want to make you dust.

729
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,320
Courage, let's see
you know to do.

730
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:04,320
This time I will destroy.
You have my word.

731
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,520
Fuck you, come here ..

732
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:36,720
- Young man sitting on my stomach.
- Actually Your stay on mine.

733
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,840
My hand ..

734
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,640
Freeze!

735
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,920
Sit or I'll shoot!

736
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:59,520
Peace, to make peace, Mr. Lamb!
Please forgive me.

737
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,520
- Friends? No?
- No.

738
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,840
No, no ..

739
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,800
Benjamin!

740
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:58,600
Courage, and close the holes
we are sowing ago.

741
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:02,440
Are you sure that you are interested in a
million dollars in a Swiss bank?

742
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,400
- What do you think Horatio?
- No, not God.

743
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:09,920
- In Switzerland there are many cows.
- Sorry, Horatio is old,

744
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,600
and Switzerland is far ..

745
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,680
Benjamin run and bring cans,
Hurry!

746
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:27,640
- Yes sir!
- Oh, no.

747
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:31,240
There is no place on this planet
where to you can make a hole

748
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,600
in this land,
without that mess out?

749
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,600
Yes, in Italy.

750
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:38,480
Earth this is not good
the cultivated onion, Horatio.

751
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:41,640
- Finally you understand.
- What are you doing?

752
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:45,920
I take my cart and go, live?

753
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:56,040
Hey ceparule I finished with you.
Come back!

754
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:05,240
