1
00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:03,296
Previously on AMC's Hell on Wheels...

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,203
You are evil!

3
00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:07,548
Cheyenne is my city,

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,458
run by my mayor in support of my railroad.

5
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:12,357
He shot a cheater.

6
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:14,394
- That's no crime here.
- It is now.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,465
We're leaving here together,
you, me, and baby William,

8
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:19,118
You'll be shot, you try to leave.

9
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,466
By your hand, you took his life!

10
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:24,587
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

11
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:27,295
- I'll get us to Cheyenne.
- It's a big city.

12
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:29,628
We thought you was dead.

13
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:41,161
To build the transcontinental railroad,

14
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:43,796
Thomas "Doc" Durant once said

15
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:47,503
"A man must face his demons and destroy them

16
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:50,782
or become undone by them."

17
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:54,486
The hell on wheels of 1868
is no place for bashful men,

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,193
the deluded, or unassured.

19
00:00:57,228 --> 00:01:00,730
No place for sloppy men,
drunk and disorderly in their

20
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:04,971
heavenly vestments on their
way to an early grave.

21
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:08,643
The railroad has contained the
west these last three years,

22
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:12,384
with its iron horse and
rails pinned to the ground.

23
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:19,061
And each passing day brings
with it civilization,

24
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:21,898
if not civility.

25
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:25,606
And men in suits, who do now with their pens

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,709
what earlier,
rougher men did with their guns.

27
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:51,719
Cullen Bohannon, late of the union pacific,

28
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:54,259
is more gunman than suit.

29
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:02,967
His return to Cheyenne;
These days referred to

30
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:05,038
as the "Magic city of the plains,"

31
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:08,811
after months lost to the
prairie and presumed dead,

32
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:11,648
with a mormon wife and child in tow,

33
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:14,353
might be just the grease we need to turn

34
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:16,222
the wheels of our national obsession,

35
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:18,759
buried these long winter months in snow

36
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:22,399
and now, up to its Wheel-Wells in mud.

37
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:26,204
Or might it be the match
strike of self-immolation?

38
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,174
For Mr. Bohannon has
always worn his integrity

39
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:31,242
like a millstone around his neck.

40
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:32,410
Howdy.

41
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:34,413
Ho.

42
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:35,416
Help you?

43
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,718
You can step aside.

44
00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:38,921
Bohannon's back!

45
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,532
- What's your business here?
- None of your business.

46
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:50,932
Ha. You hear that, deputy?

47
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:54,137
It's none of our business.

48
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:58,543
There's nothin' here for
mormons but trouble, friend.

49
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,379
I ain't lookin' for trouble.

50
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:06,801
Just the kind of people
trouble finds in my town.

51
00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:10,126
There's a mormon settlement
50, 60 Miles to the northwest.

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,361
You'll be welcome there.

53
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:13,065
Let go of my horse.

54
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,520
Let go of my horse.

55
00:03:36,427 --> 00:03:38,999
Don't touch me.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,100
I'd listen to her.

57
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,102
I suggest you turn around and...

58
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:45,171
Ahh!

59
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:56,082
Still blockin' my horse.

60
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:57,550
Ahh!

61
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,006
Thank you.

62
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,760
Let's go.

63
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,022
Cullen Bohannon has come home,
dear reader.

64
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:34,625
And in our little world
just west of civilization,

65
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:38,390
we find ourselves once again at his mercy.

67
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:14,902
Are you telling me it's impossible

68
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:16,071
to tunnel through that Mountain?

69
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:17,872
No man can do it?

70
00:05:17,907 --> 00:05:19,339
We've been blastin'
for morefor more than a we.

71
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:21,741
Damn thing keeps caving in on itself.

72
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:23,944
God sakes, Delaney.

73
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,578
The Sierra nevadas couldn't stop huntington.

74
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:29,516
This blip of a molehill
is not going to stop me.

75
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:33,357
The sierras are made of granite, Mr. Durant.

76
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,358
We're dealing with more
unstable terrain here.

77
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:36,726
Mudrock and shale.

78
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,197
Excuses will not get my tunnel built.

79
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:44,303
Now, do whatever you have to do.

80
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:46,774
Put on an extra shift to clear the rubble

81
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:49,312
and print up more scrip to pay the men.

82
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:51,711
They won't work for nothing,
not even the freedmen.

83
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:53,111
Mr. Durant...

84
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:55,749
That will be all. Thank you, Delaney.

85
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:17,265
This is the railroad office,

86
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,566
not the ticket office.

87
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,135
Behind the building.

88
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:24,305
Across the tracks at the depot.

89
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:25,974
Cullen Bohannon.

90
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:27,943
Here to see Durant.

91
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,455
Martin Delaney.

92
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,992
Oh.

93
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:38,527
Builder of stone and brook Bridges.

94
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:40,529
Chief engineer at the union pacific.

95
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:50,977
It's the ghost of Cullen Bohannon.

96
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,217
And... mormon, no less.

97
00:06:57,515 --> 00:06:59,716
If ever there was proof
that you cannot be killed,

98
00:06:59,717 --> 00:07:01,285
this is it.

99
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,889
The last time I saw you,
you were being dragged away

100
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,830
by a gang of masked outlaws,
never to be seen again.

101
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:09,132
It was her dad who took me.

102
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:12,467
Mormon militia on account of the...

103
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:15,337
This is my wife Naomi and,
uh, my son William.

104
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:17,408
We wintered up at fort Smith.

105
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:19,376
Took some doin', but I'm back now.

106
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:22,078
And how many mormons did
you have to put in the ground

107
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:24,750
to effect your escape?

108
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:26,386
Wasn't like that.

109
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,854
It's always like that with you, Bohannon.

110
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,356
You start a gunfight in my town,

111
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,360
nearly have us all killed, and for what?

112
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:40,430
A girl you got pregnant.

113
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:43,399
Come back for my old job.
Is it mine or not?

114
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:44,867
No. Not.

115
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,503
Your railroad's stuck, Durant.

116
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:48,674
I'm the only one who 
can get it movin' again.

117
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,011
Even if I could fire Mr. Delaney,

118
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:53,444
he has done nothing to warrant it.

119
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:55,744
You, on the other hand,
stand there wallowing

120
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:58,348
in moral turpitude, having just confessed

121
00:07:58,382 --> 00:08:01,518
to complete lack of regard
for the most basic fundamental

122
00:08:01,552 --> 00:08:04,624
needed to get this road moving:

123
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:06,426
Dependability.

124
00:08:06,461 --> 00:08:08,295
What you need to get this road movin' again

125
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,866
is a man who can get you over
sherman summit, all right?

126
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,100
He ain't him.

127
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:14,234
I am not going over, Bohannon.

128
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:15,735
I am going through.

129
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,736
And without you.

130
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,941
Welcome to Cheyenne, madam.

131
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:43,904
This ain't how I planned on things goin'.

132
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:47,174
This ain't how I pictured Cheyenne.

133
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,909
I'll figure it out.

134
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:52,645
We'll figure it out together.

135
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:56,954
Come on.

136
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:03,764
Mr. Bohannon!

137
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:05,432
You are a sight for sore eyes.

138
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:08,034
Just when I thought me luck had run out,

139
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:11,471
here you be.

140
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:13,006
What happened to you?

141
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,009
Got a mormon girl in the family way,

142
00:09:15,044 --> 00:09:17,046
and I need a job.

143
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,448
Any more questions?

144
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:21,519
Grant sent a carpetbagger out

145
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:23,688
to install law and order.

146
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:27,357
He hung a man from the rafters of my casino.

147
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:31,058
I could use a man like you.

148
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:33,195
Mm-mm.

149
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:38,734
No, thanks.

150
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:44,410
You just said you needed a job.

151
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:46,376
Not that one.

152
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:48,680
It was good to see you, Mick.

153
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,853
By the way, I'm the mayor now!

154
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:56,158
Congratulations.

155
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:59,428
Is he a close friend of yours?

156
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:03,264
Killed his brother,
and I helped to bury him.

157
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:05,998
Suppose that makes us somethin'.

158
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:08,198
I paid $28 for this rifle.

159
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,366
You can take it out of his hide.

160
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,601
When?

161
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:13,871
When I tell you.

162
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,547
A rare Bulgarian, that one.

163
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,786
Steal the milk out your tea
as soon as he look at ya.

164
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:29,686
A surveyor for the union pacific.

165
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:31,220
An employee of Mr. Durant

166
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,255
who happens to be a partner

167
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:35,593
in my casino.

168
00:10:35,627 --> 00:10:37,427
He stinks.

169
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:39,926
Get him out of here.

170
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,394
I'll leave that to you.

171
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:42,963
Get him out of here, Mcginnes.

172
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:44,765
He's your trash now.

173
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,032
And next time ye decide to turn my business

174
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:50,069
into a gallows...

175
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:52,703
You clean up before you leave.

176
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:54,641
Gentlemen.

177
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:11,066
Ho.

178
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:20,044
Hey! You coming to lunch?

179
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:27,251
This yourn.

180
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:29,253
I knowed you's comin' back, I'd have guarded

181
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,790
what little money was
hid backside and front.

182
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,026
That money fed us good for a month.

183
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,961
Bought us one hell of a hangover, too.

184
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:42,334
If you give me a job,
we'll forget about the money.

185
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,802
You ain't been in the sun long
enough for that, Mr. Bohannon.

186
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,504
I got a family to feed.

187
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:55,715
Freedman work, Freedman Wes.

188
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,518
Fair enough.

189
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,621
Never thought I'd see the day
I'd be the boss of the boss.

190
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:02,122
Don't get used to it, Psalms.

191
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:03,656
Mm-hmm.

192
00:12:16,105 --> 00:12:18,169
Ruth.

193
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,339
I was just on my way to see you now.

194
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,308
Well.

195
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:25,712
We all got the shock of our
lives today, didn't we?

196
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:30,849
W-with Mr. Bohannon's return to Cheyenne.

197
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,850
Yes.

198
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:36,252
I've been praying these many
months for such a miracle.

199
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:40,623
How are you, Ruth?

200
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,031
Still praying.

201
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:57,481
Reckon nobody'll start
a war if you stay here.

202
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,842
It'll do just fine.

203
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:26,614
Here.

204
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,874
Eat.

205
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:33,735
Yeah, there we go.

206
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,336
Now.

207
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:38,341
You have trouble on the way,
you can see church lady.

208
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,135
Her name's Ruth, she'll help.

209
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:41,676
I won't need any help.

210
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:50,418
I'll be fine.

211
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:52,651
We'll be fine.

212
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,064
What you think?

213
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:05,535
You gonna be fine?

214
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,137
Huh?

215
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:08,170
Yeah?

216
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:14,205
I expect miss Ruth happy you're back.

217
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,442
Took it hard the day you gone missin'.

218
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:18,875
Got her hands full with that boy, too.

219
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:20,875
I expect she won't be none too happy

220
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,911
she find out you got yourself a new woman.

221
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:25,644
New baby, too.

222
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,481
Uh-oh. Here come your other woman problem.

223
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:32,050
Elam went after you
and got his self killed!

224
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:35,083
Elam went his own way, as always.

225
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:36,484
Eva, calm down now!

226
00:14:36,518 --> 00:14:38,419
You disappeared and he went after you,

227
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:39,418
as always!

228
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:41,317
Eva, I'm sorry.

229
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:44,772
Sorry ain't gonna bring him back.

230
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:47,422
All right, load 'em up, children!

231
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:49,255
That my daylight you burnin' here!

232
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,753
And I ain't cookin' up no more.

233
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:11,004
I'm curious to know if
Mr. Bohannon will resume

234
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:13,308
his role as chief engineer
now that he's returned.

235
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:15,443
No, Mr. Delaney is chief engineer now

236
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:18,179
and will be for the foreseeable future.

237
00:15:18,214 --> 00:15:20,117
You don't expect any political pressure

238
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:22,487
from Washington to restore
Bohannon to his post?

239
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:23,856
No, why?

240
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,191
He saved a young boy's life?

241
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,094
People around the country
view him as a hero.

242
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,030
Washington loves a hero.

243
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:35,302
There is a difference between a hero

244
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:36,971
and a man who's lost his way,
miss Ellison...

245
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:41,910
Something Washington nor
you seem to understand.

246
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,812
If I didn't know better,

247
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,182
I might mistake your obsession with Bohannon

248
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,880
for something more, uh...

249
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:53,382
Personal.

250
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,820
He's not that interesting.

251
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,395
Excuse me, miss Ellison. I, uh...

252
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:17,308
That's the flag of the
new Wyoming territory.

253
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,009
Odd place for it.

254
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,345
One day when people arrive on your train,

255
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:23,849
they'll look up, see that flag flyin'

256
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,649
above my statehouse

257
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,487
and know the value we place
on law and order around here.

258
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:32,892
Law abiding people who
admire the confiscation

259
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:35,860
of private property, hmm?

260
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,562
That's railroad land.

261
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,757
Technically,
if it's not in use by the railroad

262
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,867
for railroad purposes,
that land is available

263
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:46,369
for acquisition by the
state under eminent domain.

264
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:48,470
That's the law, Mr. Durant.

265
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,335
I will not be intimidated

266
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:56,339
by your interpretation of law, Mr. Campbell.

267
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:58,972
Nor by the hanging
shenanigans of your lawmen

268
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:01,175
in the casino a few days ago.

269
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:02,944
Now, that land's the future site

270
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:05,546
of the union pacific food depot.

271
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,954
My engineers are drawing
up plans even as we speak.

272
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:16,426
If there is no structure
on that hill within 24 hours,

273
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,462
Mr. Durant, my office will file form 0939,

274
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,631
condemning that property for state use...

275
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:25,266
As set forth by the united
states railroad act.

276
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,604
Fair enough, Mr. Campbell.

277
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:31,808
Fair enough.

278
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,759
Mr. Campbell.

279
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:42,457
Miss Ellison.

280
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:45,460
That's a lovely color.

281
00:17:45,494 --> 00:17:46,461
Excuse me?

282
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:49,091
On you, that is.

283
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,468
Thank you.

284
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,169
Allow me.

285
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:55,170
Oh, I can manage on my own.

286
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:56,372
Thank you.

287
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:13,093
I need half a dozen of my
chicken coops on the hill

288
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:15,126
just east of the church by tomorrow morning.

289
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,362
Divert whatever manpower
and supplies you need.

290
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,131
I just put a second shift on the grade.

291
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,533
Per your orders.

292
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,866
Oh, well, thank you, Delaney.

293
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,468
Let me know when it's done.

294
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:46,830
You're late.

295
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:48,567
You playin' faro in here now?

296
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:50,402
I don't see how that's
any business of yours, Eva

297
00:18:50,437 --> 00:18:52,038
how much does the last three cards pay?

298
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,511
Clean the tables.

299
00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:56,848
You ain't thinkin'
of gambling in my casino now?

300
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:58,817
Uh... yeah.

301
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:00,919
I'm thinkin' I will, Mickey.

302
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:02,185
You could lose everything.

303
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:04,253
I got nothin' left to lose.

304
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:10,860
Small bit of advice then.

305
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:13,061
Stay away from the Faro table.

306
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:14,763
The box is rigged.

307
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:28,437
Afternoon, fellas.

308
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:33,508
You, uh, lost little lady?

309
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:35,275
Why?

310
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,190
My money ain't good enough for ya?

311
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:43,890
- It's good enough for me.
- Hey.

312
00:19:43,924 --> 00:19:46,458
You want to hear the story
of how I lost my scalp?

313
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:47,791
Not again, Wallace.

314
00:19:47,825 --> 00:19:48,793
Deal me in.

315
00:19:48,827 --> 00:19:50,295
My pleasure.

316
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,079
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

317
00:21:58,105 --> 00:22:00,206
- Name's Bohannon.
- Yes, sir.

318
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:03,030
Yes, sir.

319
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,082
Any you all ever been
chased by a bloodhound?

320
00:22:18,116 --> 00:22:20,182
- We familiar.
- Yeah, well,

321
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:23,221
on Sherman's march to the sea,
he told his men,

322
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:24,921
he said, "You come across any bloodhounds,

323
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:25,922
you shoot 'em," right?

324
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:27,892
So, they get to Savannah.

325
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:29,691
And this real green private,
he's walkin' down the street

326
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,445
and he sees this lady
walking with a poodle.

327
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:32,789
You know, bows in its hair and everything.

328
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:34,123
One look at the poodle, pulls out his gun.

329
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:35,560
Right in the head.

330
00:22:35,594 --> 00:22:37,127
Sherman comes runnin' up to him,

331
00:22:37,162 --> 00:22:38,693
says "Son, why'd you kill that poodle?"

332
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:40,569
And the private says "Sir, well,

333
00:22:40,596 --> 00:22:43,631
on account of you... You never
what they're gonna grow into."

334
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:53,967
Come on.

335
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:57,614
What's a poodle?

336
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,902
That'll be $9.00 and 23¢.

337
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:15,488
We take cash or scrip.

338
00:23:15,522 --> 00:23:17,157
Can I get credit?

339
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:18,692
No credit.

340
00:23:18,726 --> 00:23:20,459
If you ain't got cash nor scrip,

341
00:23:20,494 --> 00:23:23,296
I can't sell you nothin'.

342
00:23:23,331 --> 00:23:26,031
But I need these things.

343
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:29,001
And I got a business to run.

344
00:23:29,036 --> 00:23:30,705
That's all right, Mr. Adler.

345
00:23:30,739 --> 00:23:34,241
I'll take care of Mrs.
Bohannon's sundries today.

346
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:40,247
I'm sure Mr. Bohannon is good for it.

347
00:23:40,281 --> 00:23:42,414
Yes, sir, Mr. Campbell.

348
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:43,548
Whatever you say.

349
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,548
I'ma raise ya.

350
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:17,749
All right, young lady.

351
00:24:17,783 --> 00:24:18,782
Call.

352
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:39,901
Full house.

353
00:24:39,935 --> 00:24:44,435
Queens over 10s.

354
00:24:45,937 --> 00:24:48,741
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, easy now.

355
00:24:48,776 --> 00:24:50,410
Not so fast.

356
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:55,452
You know, it really is hard to beat a lady.

357
00:24:55,486 --> 00:24:57,120
Unless you're a king.

358
00:25:05,827 --> 00:25:08,960
But how did... how'd you do that?

359
00:25:08,994 --> 00:25:11,163
No, that ain't right.

360
00:25:11,198 --> 00:25:13,866
Don't cry. It's only money.

361
00:25:29,646 --> 00:25:32,211
Howdy, ma'am.

362
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,325
I don't want my money back, I swear.

363
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,792
I just want to know how you cheated me.

364
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,969
You cheated yourself, woman,

365
00:26:09,004 --> 00:26:11,638
by sittin' down at a table
with the likes of me.

366
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:14,206
Now, you are either desperate,

367
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:16,641
greedy,

368
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:19,243
or stupid.

369
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,045
I'm just desperate.

370
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,883
And stupid.

371
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,383
And I need to know how you did it.

372
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,921
That's dangerous knowledge

373
00:26:27,956 --> 00:26:29,393
for someone who don't know how to use it.

374
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:31,259
I know how to use it.

375
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:39,705
It's all in the grip.

376
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,575
Now, say if someone were to cheat...

377
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,347
Thumb, fingertips.

378
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:49,048
Thumb, fingertips.

379
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:57,826
Teach me.

380
00:26:57,861 --> 00:27:01,695
What took me years to perfect?

381
00:27:01,729 --> 00:27:03,766
I ain't stupid.

382
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:08,099
I'll make it worth your while.

383
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,225
Double the powder on those charges.

384
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,860
Yes, sir.

385
00:27:36,795 --> 00:27:39,430
That much powder's likely
to get us all killed.

386
00:27:39,465 --> 00:27:42,134
Boss man decide how much powder we use.

387
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:45,368
You ain't boss man no more.

388
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,443
Mr. Delaney.

389
00:27:55,477 --> 00:27:57,243
That rock?

390
00:27:57,277 --> 00:27:58,679
It's shale.

391
00:27:58,713 --> 00:28:01,016
Where there's shale, there's methane.

392
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,084
You double that powder,

393
00:28:03,117 --> 00:28:04,985
Shrapnel's likely to kill every man

394
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:08,157
within about a hundred yards
of that wall right there.

395
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:14,673
Get back to work, Bohannon.

396
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:16,710
I want your advice, I'll ask for it.

397
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:18,781
All right. Turn them tables over,

398
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:20,775
get behind 'em before that thing blows.

399
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:24,853
You know I ain't one to come

400
00:28:24,888 --> 00:28:26,222
between two feudin' white men.

401
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:28,097
You don't want to die, neither.

402
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:33,832
Do it! Turn 'em over!

403
00:28:39,504 --> 00:28:41,443
Light those fuses.

404
00:29:01,432 --> 00:29:05,335
Mr. Bohannon,
you about to get your job back.

405
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:11,940
Shit!

406
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:17,275
What do you want?

407
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:23,849
I didn't know Elam'd gone lookin' for me.

408
00:30:23,883 --> 00:30:25,384
You shoulda known you'd
disappear like that,

409
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:27,420
he's gonna come lookin'.

410
00:30:27,455 --> 00:30:29,856
I didn't disappear. I was took.

411
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:33,260
By armed men against my will.

412
00:30:37,062 --> 00:30:39,195
But by then he wasn't listenin' to me.

413
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:41,599
I've been havin' dreams...

414
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,567
About Elam.

415
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:48,671
Not every night, but most nights.

416
00:30:48,706 --> 00:30:50,606
I'm in a big city somewheres.

417
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,207
Chicago.

418
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:53,741
New York.

419
00:30:53,775 --> 00:30:54,744
I'm lost.

420
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:56,046
Walkin' the streets.

421
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:59,084
Lookin' into peoples' homes.

422
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:01,620
Their nice warm windows.

423
00:31:01,655 --> 00:31:02,955
I'm on the outside.

424
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:05,124
Always on the outside.

425
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,026
Everyone's afraid of me.

426
00:31:09,396 --> 00:31:12,701
I think it's 'cause of my tattoo.

427
00:31:12,735 --> 00:31:16,805
And then I realize...

428
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,810
That's not what it is.

429
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:23,382
I see my reflection.

430
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:26,084
I'm not me anymore.

431
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:27,954
I'm a bear,

432
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:31,756
and I'm lookin' for Elam.

433
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,092
Thems is just dreams, Eva.

434
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:40,265
They don't mean nothin'.

435
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,302
He considered you a friend, Mr. Bohannon.

436
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:45,339
I expect that might mean somethin' to ya,

437
00:31:45,374 --> 00:31:49,106
since I know you ain't had many.

438
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,939
Well...

439
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:52,373
One fewer now.

440
00:32:04,248 --> 00:32:07,986
Mr. Thomas Durant of the union pacific

441
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,288
is not the first person we've run into

442
00:32:10,322 --> 00:32:12,156
who didn't see things my way.

443
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,490
No, sir.

444
00:32:13,524 --> 00:32:14,524
Come here!

445
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:21,732
If people believe any one
of them is above the law,

446
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:25,003
there will be no law.

447
00:32:25,037 --> 00:32:27,372
Durant?

448
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:30,843
I'd like to ask judge Webber
his opinion on a remedy.

449
00:32:30,877 --> 00:32:32,812
This hour, you're likely to find him

450
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:37,151
at the faro tables or the whorehouse.

451
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:39,320
Yes, sir.

452
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,324
Hey!

453
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:47,396
Get off! Get off!

454
00:33:02,372 --> 00:33:05,474
How was your day, husband?

455
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:07,875
It was fine.

456
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,928
- Yours?
- Just fine.

457
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,319
Mr. Bohannon.

458
00:33:16,353 --> 00:33:20,690
You in there?

459
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:27,063
Mr. Bohannon.

460
00:33:27,097 --> 00:33:29,064
Governor Campbell.

461
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,498
Why, it's nice to see you again,
Mrs. Bohannon.

462
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:34,867
You got somethin' to say to my wife, son,

463
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:36,035
you talk to me.

464
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:38,936
I bought her a meal is all.

465
00:33:38,971 --> 00:33:43,573
How you enjoyin' it?

466
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:47,644
I can buy my own meals.

467
00:33:47,678 --> 00:33:53,549
You handled yourself
mightily with my men yesterday.

468
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:56,486
Like I told 'em,
I ain't lookin' for trouble.

469
00:33:56,521 --> 00:33:58,224
Y'all have a good night.

470
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:03,931
General Grant holds you in
high regard, Mr. Bohannon.

471
00:34:03,966 --> 00:34:05,663
What do you want?

472
00:34:05,698 --> 00:34:09,269
A man of your stature
livin' amongst the, uh...

473
00:34:09,303 --> 00:34:10,538
Negros?

474
00:34:10,572 --> 00:34:13,844
Freedmen.

475
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:16,682
Now, you don't have to live
in squalor, Mr. Bohannon.

476
00:34:16,716 --> 00:34:18,917
You work for me. I'll pay you a decent wage.

477
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:20,754
I already got a job.

478
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:22,957
I'll pay you three times
what you make layin' rail.

479
00:34:22,992 --> 00:34:26,194
And I'll helyou build a
house for your family.

480
00:34:26,228 --> 00:34:30,133
Until then, allow me to engage
a room for you at the hotel.

481
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,202
Hot bath, warm bed.

482
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,542
You could be there tonight, Mrs. Bohannon.

483
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:41,413
Work for a carpetbagger?

484
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:45,350
Not a chance in a hell.

485
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:55,792
The freedmen's bureau,
sir, is but one legacy

486
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:59,766
of reconstruction I believe
I shall be remembered for.

487
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,800
And fondly.

488
00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:05,607
Should you change your mind.

489
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:20,754
By my count, that's two good jobs

490
00:35:20,788 --> 00:35:24,489
that you've turned down since we got here.

491
00:35:24,524 --> 00:35:27,359
What're we meant to do then?

492
00:35:34,922 --> 00:35:36,189
Naomi...

493
00:35:36,224 --> 00:35:37,954
Everything I done...

494
00:35:37,988 --> 00:35:41,716
All the death and
destruction I put my hand to

495
00:35:41,742 --> 00:35:44,815
and was put to me...

496
00:35:45,414 --> 00:35:50,252
All that is for naught if
I don't finish this road.

497
00:36:02,572 --> 00:36:05,676
Mr. Bohannon.

498
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,832
Hmm.

499
00:36:07,144 --> 00:36:09,979
Surprised you're still here.

500
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:13,617
Likewise.

501
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,816
Ah.

502
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,385
Somethin' about the place.

503
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,386
The cuisine, no doubt.

504
00:36:20,421 --> 00:36:21,386
Thought you would have hightailed it

505
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,418
back to New York by now.

506
00:36:23,452 --> 00:36:25,221
Story keeps me here.

507
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:27,122
Mm...

508
00:36:27,157 --> 00:36:28,122
Careful it don't kill ya.

509
00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:29,388
Hasn't killed you.

510
00:36:29,422 --> 00:36:30,755
Yet.

511
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,658
I hear you got married.

512
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:34,595
Yeah.

513
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,996
Nice mormon girl.

514
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,464
I'm interested in your
story, Mr. Bohannon.

515
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,265
My readers will be as well.

516
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:46,767
Ain't a story, miss Ellison.

517
00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:49,434
Just a life.

518
00:36:49,469 --> 00:36:52,438
It's mine to live, nobody's to read about.

519
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:02,975
Oh, I...

520
00:37:03,009 --> 00:37:05,111
Sorry to interrupt your supper.

521
00:37:05,146 --> 00:37:09,116
Thought I should come by and say howdy.

522
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,552
Hey.

523
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:13,993
We thought you were dead.

524
00:37:14,028 --> 00:37:16,162
Huh?

525
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:18,764
Why'd you think that?

526
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:22,804
You would have come back otherwise.

527
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:24,608
Why don't you go wait outside, boy.

528
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,043
Go on.

529
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:35,717
Ezra has missed you, Mr. Bohannon.

530
00:37:35,752 --> 00:37:38,017
He grieved for you.

531
00:37:42,455 --> 00:37:44,556
As did I.

532
00:37:44,591 --> 00:37:47,989
You done right by him.
He's growin' up tall.

533
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:50,023
Yes.

534
00:37:53,695 --> 00:37:57,900
We're our own little family now.

535
00:37:57,934 --> 00:38:00,104
The two of us.

536
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:02,038
Ruth...

537
00:38:11,613 --> 00:38:12,914
I'm sorry.

538
00:38:16,383 --> 00:38:20,585
Now you're back.

539
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,621
With a new wife and child.

540
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:26,885
I'm sure as the railroad starts moving,

541
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,124
you'll be moving with it.

542
00:38:30,158 --> 00:38:33,527
I have my church to look after.

543
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:37,397
And the boy.

544
00:38:37,431 --> 00:38:39,765
We'll be staying here.

545
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:44,469
I come to ask a favor.

546
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,309
I don't think I can help you.

547
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:57,648
Naomi and my boy, William...

548
00:38:57,682 --> 00:39:01,854
When I'm out in the cut,
they're here all alone.

549
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:07,125
I know how you feel.

550
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,327
About mormons.

551
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:14,163
I was hopin' you could find it in your heart

552
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:16,231
to lend a hand.

553
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:19,901
If need be.

554
00:39:19,936 --> 00:39:22,438
I have built the walls of
my church to be a stronghold

555
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:24,573
for the needy, Mr. Bohannon.

556
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:27,012
Should your wife and
child ever find themselves

557
00:39:27,047 --> 00:39:28,982
at my door,

558
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:31,851
they, like everyone else in this town,

559
00:39:31,885 --> 00:39:33,688
will find it open.

560
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:57,809
You know, ain't none of
this your fault, son.

561
00:39:57,843 --> 00:40:00,211
You traded yourself for me.

562
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:04,283
Come on.

563
00:40:04,317 --> 00:40:07,319
You would have done the same.

564
00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:12,326
Anyways, thank you.

565
00:40:19,735 --> 00:40:22,942
You're welcome.

566
00:40:58,482 --> 00:41:01,486
The defrocked Chief
engineer's return to Cheyenne

567
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,855
means another actor has entered the play,

568
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,393
already half finished.

569
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:11,360
With the bombastic dreamer,

570
00:41:11,394 --> 00:41:16,130
his legacy depending on
completing this road.

571
00:41:16,164 --> 00:41:18,598
And the carpetbagging bureaucrat,

572
00:41:18,632 --> 00:41:21,633
tasked with bringing civilization to a land

573
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:26,206
that, just yesterday, boasted wild and free.

574
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:30,714
Cullen Bohannon, for reasons
this reporter has yet to divine,

575
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:35,154
seems determined to see this road through.

576
00:41:35,188 --> 00:41:39,626
Whether he does it as laborer or boss,

577
00:41:39,661 --> 00:41:42,030
alive or dead,

578
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:45,567
only time will tell, dear reader.

579
00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:48,104
Only time will tell.
