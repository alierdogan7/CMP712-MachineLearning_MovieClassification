This right here, hey, is my job.

187
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,635
Now, I work with these men.

188
00:12:31,637 --> 00:12:33,353
That man right there, he my boss.

189
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:35,355
You got yourself a nigger boss.

190
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:43,480
He's yours too,
if you want to be here, all right?

191
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:52,656
Well, life is a mystery.

192
00:12:52,658 --> 00:12:54,658
I'll give you that, Bohannon.

193
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,331
Shit.

194
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,467
Citins appear to be complying with the ban.

195
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:06,636
No one's discharged a
firearm since this morning.

196
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:09,673
[Wood creaking]

197
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:21,400
You hear somethin'?

198
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,278
[Men shouting orders]

199
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:52,582
What the hell do you think you're doin'?

200
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:54,517
I'm reading <i>the Cheyenne Leader.</i>

201
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:55,719
We could have been killed!

202
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,721
Smallest of pities.

203
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:06,863
Permission from the commissioner
of the General Land office

204
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:09,065
to invoke the right of eminent domain

205
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:11,618
for the construction of a roundhouse.

206
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:14,454
You can't tear down a Government building!

207
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:17,457
And you can't muscle
into the casino business.

208
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:20,710
Yet here we are.

209
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:23,580
What we are building here,
Mr. Campbell, is a roundtable.

210
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:27,751
A locomotive drives onto it,
and with the turn of a lever,

211
00:14:27,802 --> 00:14:30,887
the train turns around and around

212
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:34,057
until it is pointed in
the opposite direction,

213
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:37,927
ready to head back East...

214
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:40,263
Where some people belong.

215
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:59,249
Guns off and in the barrel.

216
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:01,000
I thought I came West.

217
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:04,421
Thought wrong. New law now.

218
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:05,922
That ain't my law.

219
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:07,674
We just comin' for a quick drink, is all.

220
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,626
Why separate a man from his guns?

221
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:11,628
- Come on.
- Gamblers kept gettin' killed.

222
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,463
That's why thecall gamblin'.

223
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:15,965
First one's on me.

224
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:19,102
Come on, come on!

225
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:22,305
[Background chatter, laughter]

226
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,474
That's the one, lads.

227
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:25,642
Come on, come on!

228
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,193
- Ah!
- Oh!

229
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:28,945
I'm out. No, no, no.

230
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:30,196
No, best of luck, lads.

231
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:31,865
Best of luck. I'm out.

232
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,118
Wallace, my boy! Hey.

233
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:36,536
Friend to friend?

234
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,321
60 hasn't hit in months.

235
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:41,491
Ah, you are a gentleman 
and a scholar, Mr. Mayor.

236
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:42,876
- All right, I won't keep you.
- Good luck.

237
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,377
Thank you.

238
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:47,046
Mayor's gonna buy you a drink,
Marshal Jessup.

239
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:48,331
On the old house, as it were.

240
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:50,166
Oh, your money's no good here.

241
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:51,835
Ah, it's one drink.

242
00:15:51,886 --> 00:15:53,670
I insist.

243
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:57,390
What I mean to say is,
we no longer accept patronage

244
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:01,010
from Irish scum the likes of you...

245
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:02,178
As it were.

246
00:16:06,851 --> 00:16:11,154
Isn't wise to kick a man while he's down.

247
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:12,856
He liable to kick back.

248
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:13,907
Hmm.

249
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:23,199
Here. Here's somethin' for ya.

250
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:28,171
Fresh from a English dandy
I met down in Juarez.

251
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:29,205
Mmm. Damn.

252
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:30,540
That is fresh.

253
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:33,553
It smells like home, don't it?

254
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:36,045
Well, go on. Sh ain't gonna chew itself.

255
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:42,552
You aim to make today regular, say the word.

256
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:43,853
I'll talk to Psalms.

257
00:16:43,888 --> 00:16:46,055
No money. Rotten food.

258
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:47,891
16-hour days.

259
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:50,727
I can't think of a single reason why not.

260
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:53,196
I don't know why you toil
like that dusk 'til dawn.

261
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,864
Started it.

262
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,117
So quit. We'll ride for Denver.

263
00:16:58,152 --> 00:17:01,955
No. Left too much undone already.

264
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:03,706
You'd do well to help me finish.

265
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:05,792
[Spits]

266
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,044
I ain't cut out for work.

267
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,331
Find a better way to
live down by the border?

268
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:15,301
I got by.

269
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:19,756
'Cause a train ticket to Cheyenne...

270
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:21,090
That can turn into a death certificate,

271
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,725
you ain't careful.

272
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,928
I ain't crossed no one I can't handle yet.

273
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,930
Is that what you did down in Mexico?

274
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:28,514
Handle things?

275
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:33,269
I ain't never seen rope
burns on a live man before.

276
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,940
I didn't do nothin' in Mexico...

277
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:40,443
Unless a misunderstandin'
with a señorita be a hangin' offense.

278
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:43,947
[Laughs]

279
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:45,281
Ain't no crime there, I guess.

280
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:46,749
Yeah, you know a little somethin'

281
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:48,117
about them señoritas, don't you?

282
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,453
- Heard tell.
- [Laughs]

283
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:52,505
Found a place to bunk yet?

284
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,291
Stable lets you sleep in the
straw for a nickel a night.

285
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:58,177
You'll stay with me and my wife.

286
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:00,096
Ain't much. Roof and meal.

287
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,848
Well, I suppose it's worth meetin'

288
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:04,467
the lion tamer done caged Cullen Bohannon.

289
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,936
[Spits]

290
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:09,022
Ah, damn.

291
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:12,389
Open the gate!

292
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:21,154
[Horn blowing]

293
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:44,111
Lord lion, Father Prophet, Brother Young.

294
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:47,164
- Welcome to Fort Smith.
- Yes.

295
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:50,428
I am brother Aaron Hatch,

296
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,707
acting presiding elder,

297
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,710
head of the militia.

298
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:56,711
The letter writer?

299
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:01,015
Yes. Thank you for gracing us.

300
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,720
The order to hang a Bishop
is a serious matter.

301
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,438
I hope your indictment is beyond reproof

302
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,774
and this is not a waste of my time.

303
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,564
Uh, while you are visiting us,
the maidens of our community.

304
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,286
I've come to hand down judgment,
not take up wives.

305
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:30,078
Name of the prophet Joseph bless you all.

306
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,796
Bless this bounty.

307
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,465
Show me the accused impostor.

308
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,885
You remember that beefsteak
raid in prince George county?

309
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,254
Stole 3,000 head under Grant's nose.

310
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,973
Rode with them boys from Texas.

311
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,758
Atke kgs for a month. You 'member?

312
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,226
Remember gettin' tired of beef.

313
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,260
[Laughs]

314
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:47,929
Yeah, but them first few steaks?

315
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,981
Mmm.

316
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,650
Don't hold a candle to this
fine meal here, ma'am.

317
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:56,604
I apologize if we are
boring you with old times.

318
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:59,273
It reminds me of home, actually.

319
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,275
Mm. Naomi's father heads a mormon militia

320
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,910
at a ward some ways North.

321
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:04,162
Father trained with the same men,

322
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,447
bested the U.S. cavalry in Utah.

323
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:08,282
Bested the Yankees?

324
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:12,003
Reckon I'd like to meet that
man and buy him a drink.

325
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:15,123
- We're a sober people.
- [Chuckles]

326
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,269
You mean besides your husband.

327
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,799
He ever spoke on lufton's crossing?

328
00:21:24,801 --> 00:21:27,301
Mm-mm. My husband doesn't speak on the war.

329
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:30,304
Apologies. I only...
'Cause you said you were accustomed.

330
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:31,973
No need to stop on my account.

331
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,111
I can't believe he ain't
told you this already.

332
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:39,814
It was the best day of our lives.

333
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,700
It was June of '64,
and we come across this empty train

334
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,153
at a whistle stop in backwoods Virginia.

335
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,989
It was the definition of a sitting duck.

336
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,992
But when we get inside...
Now, you're gonna love this part...

337
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,828
When we get inside, it's a medical train.

338
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,298
And it's not empty.
It's piled up with Yankees.

339
00:21:57,332 --> 00:22:00,301
They all hobbled up on cots.
They're cryin' to their mamas.

340
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,053
They ain't got a gun, nothin'.

341
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:05,473
We jump a couple sentries,
and then it's just bam...

342
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:08,009
Bam... bam...

343
00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:09,677
Bam...

344
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,512
All dead.

345
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:15,183
That's finished. The war ended.

346
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:19,687
[Chuckles]

347
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:21,606
Damn, Bohannon, they had it comin'.

348
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,527
They did, right?

349
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,431
John...

350
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,550
Have a seat.

351
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:52,687
Um, whiskey?

352
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:56,591
I've been tasked to bring order to this city

353
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,860
by the next President of the United States.

354
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:01,562
You say you bring order,

355
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:05,933
yet men hang from saloon
rafters and lampposts.

356
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:09,537
Lynch, burn, bludgeon, or bury...

357
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:13,608
I will do whatever's necessary
to rid this city of corruption,

358
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,610
then seize your railroad.

359
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,179
Seize my railroad?

360
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,084
Are you having headaches, John?

361
00:23:23,086 --> 00:23:24,919
Huh?

362
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:27,421
T-t-that edema.

363
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:31,225
Forgive me, I have a degree in ophthalmology

364
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,762
from Albany Medical College.

365
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:39,100
You see, ocular malformations

366
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:42,603
can inhibit mental processes,

367
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:45,573
clouding one's sight,

368
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:48,242
leaving one delusional.

369
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:50,478
My vision is perfectly clear.

370
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:54,715
In fact, I can see into the future, Doctor.

371
00:23:56,618 --> 00:24:00,354
You're not in it.

372
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:04,158
One moment, the world is as clear as day.

373
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,960
The next... [snaps fingers]

374
00:24:05,962 --> 00:24:08,129
It flashes to black.

375
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:12,466
[Chuckles]

376
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,970
[Laughs]

377
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,675
First your city,

378
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,010
then your railroad.

379
00:24:41,496 --> 00:24:44,548
[Belches]

380
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,884
[Spits]

381
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,836
[Wood creaks]

382
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,040
[Screams]

383
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:16,640
On the old house, as it were.

384
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:05,639
[Knock at door]

385
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:18,719
I know you remember that train.

386
00:27:18,754 --> 00:27:20,521
And I know you got hounds on your heels

387
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,356
for somethin' you done over the border.

388
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,159
Hmm?

389
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:27,495
You keep a gun within reach,
your head on a swivel,

390
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,663
and the only time I seen
pistols plated in silver

391
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:31,632
was on man tangled with Mexicans.

392
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:34,385
Then you spoke like you done
at dinner in front of my wife?

393
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,669
All you need to know is,

394
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,140
nobody findin' me here, Bohannon.

395
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:40,841
You got somebody after you.

396
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:44,678
They after the bounty, I reckon.

397
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,681
Ain't nobody findin' me.

398
00:27:47,683 --> 00:27:50,985
You need money, I'll spare my last.

399
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:54,188
Somebody comes lookin' for ya,
I'll keep a tight lip.

400
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,857
But as for a place to stay?

401
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,026
Got to be no.

402
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:03,697
Southern man don't open his home,
then dishonor his word.

403
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:07,701
I got family inside. I won't risk it.

404
00:28:07,703 --> 00:28:09,537
Risk what...

405
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:11,705
Your job chuckin' rocks with niggers,

406
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:14,592
this shit-splattered tent with rats?

407
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:15,876
Hell, I know what it is.

408
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,678
That little mormon wench

409
00:28:17,712 --> 00:28:20,381
has got your balls pressed tight
between the pages of her Bible.

410
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:23,384
My wife's name is Naomi.

411
00:28:27,722 --> 00:28:31,025
That's what I like about you, Bohannon.

412
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:33,811
You carry the worrying
share for the both of us.

413
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,731
<i>Adiós.</i>

414
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,573
Come on.

415
00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:20,717
Sidney never came back?

416
00:29:20,752 --> 00:29:23,587
He's probably halfway to Denver by now.

417
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,144
Part of you wishes you were ridin' with him.

418
00:29:43,274 --> 00:29:45,776
Sidney spoke true about
that train last night.

419
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:52,082
Sick and wounded...

420
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:55,636
Killed 'em all...

421
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,421
The doctors too.

422
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:06,096
I can't make sense of it.

423
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:07,981
Can't.

424
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:12,686
We was tired of losin' the war.

425
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,325
Men like Sidney...

426
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,745
They like to think we won somethin'
that day.

427
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,948
Me, I just...

428
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,001
All I can remember is, after it was over,

429
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:30,370
how hot my gun was.

430
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,511
Smelled like blood and honeysuckle.

431
00:30:42,684 --> 00:30:44,801
So when we talk about Sidney...

432
00:30:47,855 --> 00:30:50,357
Yeah.

433
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,309
I ain't no better than him.

434
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:55,862
No, that's your mistake.

435
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:04,821
All the people I could lose money to,

436
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:07,207
beautiful woman tops my list.

437
00:31:16,718 --> 00:31:19,670
Familiar with the term "Drawing dead"?

438
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:22,639
Honey, I'm always drawin' live.

439
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:25,676
If I were to die,
I reckon I'd use my last breath on you.

440
00:31:30,415 --> 00:31:32,065
I bet it all.

441
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:43,744
Ain't fair to take a man's money and run.

442
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:46,580
You ain't positioned to be givin'
lessons on what's fair,

443
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:49,082
now, is you?

444
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:50,951
Is you?

445
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,939
Hey. Get out of here.

446
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,289
Watch yourself.

447
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:30,574
[Gunshot]

448
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:33,410

449
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,162
<i> Sí, sí.</i>

450
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:40,083
[Gun clicking] Shit.

451
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,553
<i>Suéltela.</i>

452
00:33:36,023 --> 00:33:37,974
<i>¡Suéltela!</i>

460
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,552
Any last words?

[Clicks tongue, sighs]

464
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:37,367
You shot a kid.

465
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,369
Oh, no, he was caught in the crossfire.

466
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,288
No, he wasn't. You shot him.

467

You turn around real slow.

[Baby fusses] Shh.

471
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:26,249
Take him.

472
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,602
- [Baby fusses] 
- Shh.

473
00:35:28,604 --> 00:35:31,688
You all right? You all right?

474
00:35:33,107 --> 00:35:36,910
We... we... we needed bread.

475
00:35:36,944 --> 00:35:40,580
[Baby crying]

476
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,576
Now leave us.

[Door creaks closed]

478
00:36:19,796 --> 00:36:23,282
Brother Brigham...

479
00:36:23,729 --> 00:36:27,148
Lion of the Lord.

480
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:34,476
I bow down before Your glory.

481
00:36:34,478 --> 00:36:37,813
Be advised...

482
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:41,650
My hand will fall with
the might of God's fist

483
00:36:41,652 --> 00:36:44,152
should he reveal a necessary judgment today.

484
00:36:44,154 --> 00:36:48,657
I accept your judgment...

485
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,792
As Heavenly Father's own.

486
00:36:50,827 --> 00:36:52,661
Brother Hatch charges

487
00:36:52,695 --> 00:36:56,331
you presided over this ward as an impostor

488
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:59,050
after murdering Bishop
Joseph Dutson and his family.

489
00:36:59,085 --> 00:37:01,303
How do you meet these charges?

490
00:37:01,337 --> 00:37:05,507
I am a former immigrant...

491
00:37:06,806 --> 00:37:09,275
A soldier,

492
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:11,810
prisoner of war.

493
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:13,646
I was born

494
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:18,484
and have remained to this day a pilgrim,

495
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:22,655
a lone man on an... on an exodus

496
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:28,127
West to the promised land, cast out.

497
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:30,296
But every home I have found

498
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:34,166
as a... as a leper.

499
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:37,836
My time as father of this ward...

500
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:42,341
It's already fostered a miracle.

501
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:45,811
My miracle is Cullen Bohannon...

502
00:37:45,845 --> 00:37:48,681
A man who cast me out,

503
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:51,517
tried to kill me,

504
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:54,353
was brought to this ward

505
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,406
by the hand of God to be saved.

506
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,692
And after a winter of spiritual healing,

507
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:03,579
this gentile, sinner, killer, slaver

508
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:07,333
fell to his knees

509
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:10,869
and begged for forgiveness.

510
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:15,341
If that is not

511
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:20,262
divine Providence of God...

512
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:23,549
Then, brother...

513
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,217
Hang me.

514
00:38:28,888 --> 00:38:31,223
I believe father's lips
have not pursed at your ear,

515
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:33,525
nor his hands laid on your shoulders.

516
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,562
You appear nothing more
than a ravening wolf.

517
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:41,066
What you stand accused of,
spilling the blood of a Saint,

518
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,286
is a heinous, sinful crime

519
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,121
whose just punishment

520
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:49,908
must be of equal weight and measure.

521
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,997
Yes.

522
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,300
[Sighs]

523
00:38:58,334 --> 00:39:03,088
And yet the spur line,

524
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,758
which proves essential to
the Saint's journey west

525
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,259
to the promised land,

526
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,062
has made twice the
progress under your tenure

527
00:39:10,096 --> 00:39:12,648
than it did under your predecessor.

528
00:39:12,682 --> 00:39:16,101
You worked on the Gentile's road?

529
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,604
Under Thomas Durant, head of...

530
00:39:18,638 --> 00:39:22,074
I know who he is.

531
00:39:22,108 --> 00:39:25,177
What did you think of the man?

532
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:27,996
I hated him

533
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:32,367
with the fire of a thousand suns.

534
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:42,211
Perhaps Heavenly Father
has a use for you yet.

535
00:39:51,805 --> 00:39:55,474
That man shot a child.

536
00:39:57,727 --> 00:40:00,813
He'll know justice.

537
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:03,315
Our son was next.

538
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:07,653
Hey.

539
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:10,456
Hey.

540
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,959
I wouldn'tet that happen.

541
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:16,712
I thought you would have killed him.

542
00:40:28,756 --> 00:40:33,510
I wasn't gonna shoot her, and you know it...

543
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:37,180
Same I knew you wasn't gonna shoot me.

544
00:40:37,231 --> 00:40:39,065
Hmm.

545
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:41,017
I wished I had.

546
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:44,854
That ain't so, Bohannon.

547
00:40:44,905 --> 00:40:47,157
Truth is, you even wish 
you were in here with me,

548
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:50,527
waitin' for someone like us to bust us out.

549
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,915
That's it, ain't it?

550
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,834
You miss it.

551
00:40:57,868 --> 00:41:01,337
Nah.

552
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:03,506
I'll be glad to watch you hang.

553
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:06,709
I've been hung before.

554
00:41:06,744 --> 00:41:10,079
Life sure is a mystery, ain't it, Bohannon?

555
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:18,655
[Door opens, closes]

556
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,075
Oh.

557
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:44,445
Any business with the Governor
will have to wait until morning.

558
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:48,449
- Tell me why you did it.
- Did what?

559
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,534
Jessup is dead.

560
00:41:52,788 --> 00:41:56,507
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

561
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,714
I loved him.

562
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:10,304
You loved him?

563
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:15,443
Oh, I see.

564
00:42:15,477 --> 00:42:17,979
Well, whatever it is you think I've done,

565
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:20,448
I can assure you, you are wrong.

566
00:42:20,482 --> 00:42:23,034
Stop lying.

567
