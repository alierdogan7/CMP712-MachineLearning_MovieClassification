00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:54,915
Well, this was
a pretty good knife once, eh?

191
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:59,374
Never let a blade
go blunt too long.

192
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,314
Everything all right, Tom?

193
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:10,033
With the farm?

194
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:11,908
With your dad?

195
00:18:12,752 --> 00:18:14,452
I suppose.

196
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,533
We're here to help you, son.

197
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,024
We're here to help you
and your dad out.

198
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:24,236
So if there's anything you need
or anything you want to tell me,

199
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,136
you can.

200
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:29,477
You know that, don't you?

201
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:31,542
Yeah.

202
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:34,822
Reckon you could finish this up?

203
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,650
Yeah.

204
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:38,728
Yeah.

205
00:18:38,728 --> 00:18:43,110
Reckon you can turn your hand
at just about anything, Tom.

206
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:49,517
[Groans]

207
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:23,565
[Gunshot]

208
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:31,390
[Gunshot]

209
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:42,201
[Flies buzzing]

210
00:19:57,134 --> 00:20:00,369
[Gunshot]

211
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:25,782
Do you think
they killed lots of boers?

212
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:30,727
It's perfectly obvious
that man's a murderer.

213
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:32,762
[Gunshot]

214
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:39,353
That boy's going to die here, and we're
all going to be chopped up with an ax.

215
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:41,392
Tom.

216
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:54,774
Nat, I reckon we should
start again from scratch,

217
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:57,005
if that's all right with you.

218
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:00,470
You do what you think's best.

219
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:04,456
Tom and I have to check
some traps.

220
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:10,759
I'd appreciate it
if you stayed away from there.

221
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,972
You have the balls.

222
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:20,755
Tom.

223
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,925
[Mumbling indistinctly]

224
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,532
[Gasps]

225
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,632
Who are you?

226
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:11,719
I'm Sarah.

227
00:22:11,953 --> 00:22:15,292
Love a boy back to life, is it?

228
00:22:19,743 --> 00:22:21,652
Excuse me.

229
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:24,992
Excuse me.

230
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,953
Bloody thirsty work
building your locker for you.

231
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:05,101
And you check that one.

232
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:14,689
Empty.

233
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:21,640
Well, they can't all be empty,
can they?

234
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:41,587
[Laughs]

235
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:43,797
Whoa!
Dad!

236
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,531
This is pretty good!

237
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,538
Very impressive.

238
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:55,804
[Laughs]

239
00:23:56,428 --> 00:23:59,582
Mr. Henry, look at me.

240
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,748
Traps empty?

241
00:24:03,217 --> 00:24:05,943
How's the boy doing?

242
00:24:09,077 --> 00:24:10,850
Sarah?

243
00:24:12,874 --> 00:24:14,248
How's his fever?

244
00:24:14,249 --> 00:24:16,416
- The fever broke earlier.
- Good.

245
00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:18,366
I mean, he looks better,

246
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:20,475
but he's still...

247
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:33,092
We'll move him out
to the stables.

248
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:35,545
Make up a bed for him.

249
00:24:42,428 --> 00:24:44,428
Hey, kid.

250
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:13,623
[Grunts]

251
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:16,436
[Breathing heavily]

252
00:25:16,436 --> 00:25:18,369
Sarah.

253
00:25:21,147 --> 00:25:23,549
[Gunshot]

254
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:35,374
[Gunshot]

255
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:50,538
You should get the boy
to bag some roos for you.

256
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:52,238
Outstanding shot.

257
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:54,505
I shot a wooden boer, dad.

258
00:25:54,506 --> 00:25:55,490
Look.

259
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:56,670
Boys.

260
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:59,702
We could take the rifles out
in the morning,

261
00:25:59,702 --> 00:26:01,341
Jimmy's still down.

262
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:02,936
I shot it off the log.

263
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:06,046
Come and shoot
some black crows, are you?

264
00:26:06,046 --> 00:26:08,213
Shoot some blackbirds?

265
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:10,615
What's he talking about?

266
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:12,397
Nothing.

267
00:26:12,624 --> 00:26:14,191
How about it, Nat?

268
00:26:14,577 --> 00:26:18,428
Carver will stay back and chop
some logs for your new locker.

269
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,529
Eh, Carver?

270
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:22,474
Yeah.

271
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:25,045
Sure.
Come on, Tom.

272
00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:34,302
Interesting kid.

273
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:37,802
Doesn't deserve a man
like that for a father.

274
00:26:37,803 --> 00:26:39,469
What does that mean?

275
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:41,569
Well, he thinks
he should get it different

276
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:44,503
just 'cause he's got God
on his side.

277
00:26:44,505 --> 00:26:46,372
Careful, Carver.

278
00:26:46,702 --> 00:26:49,857
Takes three generations
to make a gentleman.

279
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,608
And about three minutes
to unmake him.

280
00:26:56,889 --> 00:26:59,694
We've seen things, Henry,

281
00:26:59,694 --> 00:27:02,370
things other people like.

282
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:05,528
Counts for something.

283
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:10,099
Ain't that right?

284
00:27:12,227 --> 00:27:14,227
Yeah.

285
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,200
That's right.

286
00:27:30,522 --> 00:27:33,253
That Jimmy breaking into song yet?

287
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,314
Yeah, he's dancing with a horse.

288
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,824
You were a captain, yes?

289
00:27:46,825 --> 00:27:49,659
Major.

290
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,616
And you, Mr. Carver?

291
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,208
What's it to you?

292
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,537
I'm just interested.

293
00:27:59,123 --> 00:28:01,184
Well, I ain't.

294
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:04,385
Oh, leave
the glum bastard alone.

295
00:28:04,386 --> 00:28:08,292
He's got a chip on his shoulder
the size of your arm.

296
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,398
[Door creaks]

297
00:28:23,808 --> 00:28:26,559
You look like you're in
some nativity scene.

298
00:28:27,175 --> 00:28:29,275
What?

299
00:28:32,582 --> 00:28:36,087
Well, you seem better, anyway.

300
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,863
Where's Henry?

301
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:45,264
Inside talking with my dad.

302
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:50,026
Where is your family?

303
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:51,957
Don't know.

304
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:54,799
Same for Henry,

305
00:28:55,394 --> 00:28:59,429
except worse, I guess, 'cause
he had a wife and kids and all.

306
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:04,732
Henry sort of fell...
fell to drinking there.

307
00:29:04,732 --> 00:29:06,755
That man Carver,
he drinks a lot.

308
00:29:06,756 --> 00:29:08,904
Ah, he's all right.

309
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:11,471
He's just got that way
about him.

310
00:29:11,472 --> 00:29:14,130
He's had a rough ride,
no mistake.

311
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,427
He got beat senseless by his father
when he was a little Tucker.

312
00:29:17,428 --> 00:29:19,607
Got brought up by his brother

313
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:22,427
boundary riding
for the squatters and the like.

314
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,694
Where is he now?

315
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:42,372
Keep a secret?

316
00:29:45,646 --> 00:29:49,048
So up on the gold fields, right,
we gave it a go.

317
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:53,986
There was nothing there, so Henry said
we'd go back to the city to find work.

318
00:29:55,076 --> 00:29:56,076
What?

319
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:02,001
Well, they thought
there was nothing there.

320
00:30:02,523 --> 00:30:04,690
Nothing.

321
00:30:04,692 --> 00:30:06,659
Not a bean.

322
00:30:07,288 --> 00:30:13,592
You had diggers up there gnawing in the
same bone for weeks on end dressed in rags.

323
00:30:13,593 --> 00:30:15,398
Bloody grim sight,

324
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:18,140
what humanity can sink to,

325
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,006
clawing at the dirt

326
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:24,573
just for the chance
to strike it rich.

327
00:30:26,722 --> 00:30:30,636
I've seen men reduced to states
you wouldn't wish on a hog.

328
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,668
And this is just about
the worse thing I've seen.

329
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:37,510
You see it in men's eyes,

330
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:39,277
desperation.

331
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:42,862
I won't have alcohol
in my house.

332
00:31:03,392 --> 00:31:06,361
We're weak creatures,

333
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:08,261
corrupted.

334
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:10,689
I've seen Mr. Connolly drinking.

335
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:13,244
Is that right, Tom?

336
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:16,994
Get yourself to bed now, Tupper.

337
00:31:16,994 --> 00:31:18,822
You're going shooting
in the morning, remember?

338
00:31:18,822 --> 00:31:20,508
Go on.

339
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:22,759
Hey, hey.

340
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:35,341
Tupper?

341
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:44,313
He used to crawl inside
this banged up old stovepipe

342
00:31:44,314 --> 00:31:48,494
of my father's
when he was a baby.

343
00:31:48,494 --> 00:31:50,618
Miss it?

344
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:53,720
The old country?

345
00:32:01,228 --> 00:32:03,235
No.

346
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,340
It's a strange thing.

347
00:32:08,587 --> 00:32:11,555
The land here, it...

348
00:32:13,972 --> 00:32:16,073
it speaks.

349
00:32:18,494 --> 00:32:19,844
You just...

350
00:32:19,845 --> 00:32:21,945
[Clears throat]

351
00:32:27,085 --> 00:32:29,228
Listen.

352
00:32:31,697 --> 00:32:35,322
You know, sometimes
you got to go your own way.

353
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:38,064
Sometimes it's right
to put yourself first.

354
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:41,822
Do you know what I'm saying?

355
00:32:41,822 --> 00:32:43,446
I got enough here for now.

356
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:45,719
There's plenty more out there.

357
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,920
It's me big claim.

358
00:32:48,103 --> 00:32:50,986
- What will they do?
- I'll see them right. You'll see.

359
00:32:50,986 --> 00:32:54,658
I'll head back up, and they'll
think I struck it later.

360
00:32:55,716 --> 00:32:57,555
Why are you telling me?

361
00:32:57,556 --> 00:32:59,857
Why are you telling her what?

362
00:33:00,431 --> 00:33:01,930
You're always
sneaking up on people.

363
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:05,641
You're always sneaking around.
You're like a lizard.

364
00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:09,893
Tell her what, Jim?

365
00:33:09,895 --> 00:33:10,969
Nothing.

366
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,446
Nothing?

367
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:16,126
You know, you're like
a little brother to me, Jimmy.

368
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:19,298
You're like a son
to that old man in there.

369
00:33:21,197 --> 00:33:24,376
Got to sell me eights, Carver.

370
00:33:51,644 --> 00:33:53,512
[Grunts]

371
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:57,852
[Groaning quietly]

372
00:34:05,829 --> 00:34:06,900
Come on!

373
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,000
Dad!

374
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,210
Quick.

375
00:34:45,788 --> 00:34:47,459
Hmm.

376
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:50,901
Wonderful day.

377
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,348
Let's load this up
for you, Tupper.

378
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:12,327
Keep up.

379
00:35:13,202 --> 00:35:14,654
Tom.

380
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,968
Don't go letting off
any stray shells.

381
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:19,920
Keep your finger
off that trigger.

382
00:35:34,513 --> 00:35:36,181
[Gasps]

383
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,061
[Chickens clucking]

384
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:00,147
He's a fine boy.

385
00:36:00,148 --> 00:36:03,216
He's a tribute to his mother.

386
00:36:06,101 --> 00:36:08,169
Your land?

387
00:36:11,015 --> 00:36:12,998
Connolly's.

388
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:15,820
Our illustrious local landlord.

389
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:17,678
Peacocked.

390
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,471
The best stretch
is for his bloody railroad.

391
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:28,288
He's taking back the land and
pushing the small holders out.

392
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:35,624
Well, let's bag something back
for the working man, shall we?

393
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:46,206
There you go.
Privileged.

394
00:36:46,656 --> 00:36:48,179
Hey.

395
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:50,381
That's my damper.

396
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:52,301
What is it?

397
00:36:53,076 --> 00:36:54,983
Do you really like it here?

398
00:36:54,984 --> 00:36:56,884
Of course not.

399
00:36:57,406 --> 00:36:59,499
So why don't you go?

400
00:36:59,757 --> 00:37:01,842
I can't leave Tom.

401
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:04,140
I'm going my own way.

402
00:37:05,797 --> 00:37:07,563
No. I can't.

403
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:10,022
Could help you out.

404
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:13,453
You could look after it for me,

405
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,851
that thing.

406
00:37:16,761 --> 00:37:18,086
It's here with you now?

407
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:20,251
You'd be doing me a favor.

408
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:24,413
Can't keep it from them forever.

409
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:29,184
They found out I had it,
I don't know what they'd do.

410
00:37:29,702 --> 00:37:32,368
Won't be good for me.
I know that.

411
00:37:33,853 --> 00:37:35,404
I'm serious.

412
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:38,854
I have to go.

413
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:47,967
[Spits]

414
00:37:57,111 --> 00:37:59,493
You got your possums here.

415
00:38:01,282 --> 00:38:03,816
Yes. Thank you.

416
00:38:04,236 --> 00:38:08,439
Thought you might be able to
make something nice out of them.

417
00:38:11,564 --> 00:38:15,415
They're easy enough to find
if you know where to look.

418
00:38:44,353 --> 00:38:48,056
Bet you thought I was gonna be old
Henry bloody Lawson, didn't you?

419
00:38:48,057 --> 00:38:51,456
I'll ask you to put that down,
if you don't mind.

420
00:39:24,752 --> 00:39:27,001
I thought we were gonna
shoot pigs.

421
00:39:27,002 --> 00:39:30,580
You watch that gun or you'll end up
shooting yourself in the foot.

422
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,611
Wouldn't want
to have to leave you here.

423
00:39:32,612 --> 00:39:35,080
A soldier never
leaves a man behind.

424
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,279
[Chuckles]

425
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,493
You'd make a good soldier, Tom.

426
00:39:38,494 --> 00:39:40,214
Is that right?

427
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:43,424
Code of honor?

428
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,135
You ever do it, Henry?
You ever leave a man behind?

429
00:39:52,628 --> 00:39:55,306
Jimmy's mate back home.

430
00:39:55,307 --> 00:39:57,737
Gut wound.

431
00:39:57,737 --> 00:40:00,390
Nasty way to go.

432
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,127
Boers half an hour behind us.

433
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:08,557
What did you do?

434
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:11,870
I made it so that
he wouldn't suffer

435
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,136
more than he had to.

436
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,854
Terrible thing.

437
00:40:17,854 --> 00:40:21,456
You don't understand
the meaning of "necessary"

438
00:40:21,456 --> 00:40:24,081
till you've been in a war.

439
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:28,502
But it was the right thing to do.

440
00:40:28,831 --> 00:40:32,065
Always do the right thing, do you?

441
00:40:35,106 --> 00:40:38,158
I do what's necessary.

442
00:40:43,345 --> 00:40:47,089
We'll sit down together one day,
you and I,

443
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,283
and I'll tell you some stories.

444
00:40:57,184 --> 00:40:59,552
Pigs.

445
00:41:01,284 --> 00:41:02,589
You do it.

446
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:03,798
He's fine.

447
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:05,339
- Go on.
- No!

448
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:06,071
[Gunshot]

449
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:07,994
[Pig squeals] Tom!

450
00:41:08,673 --> 00:41:10,706
[Gunshot] Whoa!

451
00:41:11,197 --> 00:41:12,900
Why don't you listen to me?

452
00:41:12,901 --> 00:41:14,963
What he hell's
the matter with you?

453
00:41:14,963 --> 00:41:16,860
Huh?

454
00:41:52,908 --> 00:41:54,525
Where is it?

455
00:41:55,048 --> 00:41:56,243
Just here.

456
00:41:56,244 --> 00:41:58,001
Show me.

457
00:42:05,072 --> 00:42:06,903
It's inside them.

458
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:09,845
Here.

459
00:42:09,845 --> 00:42:12,204
You look after that lot

460
00:42:13,892 --> 00:42:16,306
while I go get this tested.

461
00:42:20,463 --> 00:42:23,009
Who's to say
I won't just run away with it?

462
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,477
Suit yourself.

463
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:27,103
There's plenty more
where that came from.

464
00:42:28,853 --> 00:42:31,555
- I can't.
- Of course you can.

465
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,947
What's the problem, eh?

466
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:37,831
It's what you want, isn't it?

467
00:42:38,711 --> 00:42:39,713
I have to make damper.

468
00:42:39,713 --> 00:42:40,829
Sarah, wait up.

469
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,532
Let me think.
I need to think.

It's my gold.

It's here, and I can do
what I want with it.

474
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:14,181
We can do what we want with it.

by morning, then.

Just follow the directions
I told you. You'll be fine.

491
00:46:35,385 --> 00:46:38,813
I'd like to thank you
and your family

492

You're not going after them?

495
00:47:18,064 --> 00:47:19,144
You can't let them go, dad.

496
00:47:19,155 --> 00:47:21,989
I'll make my own decisions.
Thank you.

497

This is our future.

- This?
- I'm your father.

What are we going to do, dad?

500

Whoo.

This ain't it.

506
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:43,139
It's back there.

507
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:46,954
That's it.

508
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,666
It's a bloody dead end.

509
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:17,133
I don't want trouble, Henry.

510
00:49:17,744 --> 00:49:21,463
When this is done,
you'll head straight that way.

511
00:49:21,463 --> 00:49:24,143
It'll take you past the river
on the high ground.

what he thought was best

for the family.

590
00:57:24,792 --> 00:57:27,219
But he was wrong.

to put things right again.

I'm sure you'll remember
everything by morning, Nat.

Yeah, Jimmy was a good kid.

There's a balance.

When things get out of balance,

605
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:44,628
you got to balance it up again.

Your father shot him, Tom.

He shot Carver,

No need for that, son.

You want respect
for your elders.

621
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,302
And then he must have
come back here,

622
00:59:48,304 --> 00:59:53,781
and he was probably nervous, right?

623
00:59:54,526 --> 00:59:58,136
And then he'd have
gone outside to the stable

624
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,541
or the shed.

625
01:00:00,542 --> 01:00:03,119

01:28:16,163 --> 01:28:18,564
you can tell me.

929
01:28:19,468 --> 01:28:21,503
Is it true, Tom?

930
01:28:23,741 --> 01:28:26,343
Is it true?

931
01:28:42,312 --> 01:28:46,662
I'm just trying
to keep the dream alive, Tom.

932
01:28:46,663 --> 01:28:49,497
That's all I'm doing.

933
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:52,210
You got a dream, son?

934
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:56,923
Yes.

935
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:00,514
And what is it?

936
01:29:10,577 --> 01:29:14,046
[Pensive piano music]

937
01:31:48,388 --> 01:31:51,412
Whoa. Whoa.

938
01:31:56,498 --> 01:31:58,866
You all right, son?

939
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:47,150
The End

01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:51,950
