1
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:33,316
No!

2
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,194
No!

3
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:49,304
No,not my business!

4
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:50,773
Don't kill me!

5
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:06,752
Let me go!

6
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:22,700
There was a story saying that
ten years ago

7
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:26,799
a big and notorious troop of
mounted bandits

8
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:31,966
were killed by a guy
who was as terrible as the God of Death

9
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,542
Not anyone could escape

10
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,091
No one knows who this guy is

11
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:58,863
No one knows where this guy comes from

12
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,095
No one knows his name either

13
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,703
So,the people called him...

14
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:05,876
The killer

15
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:09,939
What the hell was happened
on that night?

16
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:11,974
Why did he kill so many people?

17
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:13,812
No one knows the truth

18
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,214
But,all believe that

19
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:17,913
This must be related with a woman

20
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:21,990
After that night

21
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:24,654
he marked the boundary by stabbing
a sword there

22
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,095
He opened a hotel,the Peace Hotel

23
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:30,459
In the following ten years

24
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:31,558
This hotel let many poor people

25
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,036
who are utterly helpless stay

26
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,426
At that time,there was such an
understanding among the people that

27
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:01,360
No matter what a person did

28
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,861
no matter who he offended

29
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:05,797
If only he reaches the Peace Hotel alive

30
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,475
his foes could not pass the sword
and went into the hotel

31
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,669
No one could harm
that person's life again

32
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:14,439
And the Peace Hotel

33
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,707
will never bother the affairs
between them

34
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,042
They won't support anyone

35
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,344
They won't protect anyone to leave

36
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:40,335
In these ten years,
no one dares mess up in this Peace Hotel

37
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,173
And Peace Hotel has never broken
the rule to send anyone out

38
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:47,844
Until the arrival of this woman

39
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,664
Please give me a deluxe room

40
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:13,163
I want a hot water bath.
If ready,I'll be in the restaurant

41
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:27,080
Please give me a glass of wine

42
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:30,112
And if there is any precious food

43
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:32,520
just bring me some

44
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,301
You have no money!

45
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:46,528
How dare you cheat with this fake stuff?

46
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:47,961
Right!

47
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,404
You know,so many nasty people are living
in this hotel

48
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:52,102
How dare you swindle here?
Don't you want trouble?

49
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:58,776
Why don't you show this ring

50
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:00,146
to your boss first?

51
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,183
Bring some food to me at once

52
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:08,056
If I get starved,you will be in trouble

53
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,524
Go and get it now!

54
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:11,852
You'd' better tell him...

55
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:14,355
I didn't intend to have any re-union

56
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,127
Tell him to serve me a room,
I will stay two days only

57
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:21,329
I won't see him again

58
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,305
I don't want him to care
about my business

59
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:26,869
Do you know our boss

60
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,104
who you have just mentioned...

61
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:29,771
is the notorious Killer?

62
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,140
Right!

63
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:34,977
I don't know killer

64
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,345
I just know he is my damn husband

65
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:40,886
If I could choose again

66
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,318
I wish I had never met this guy!

67
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:44,494
Got it?

68
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:46,086
Boss has had a lover

69
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:48,666
He established this hotel in order to
wait for her return

70
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,801
Boss...

71
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,870
The woman who you have waited for
10 years is back!

72
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:16,020
The man who bought my virginity...

73
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,060
Iied on me like a mountain

74
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:21,725
I cried

75
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:26,064
I heard those procurers and
procuresses crying

76
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,102
They cried one after another

77
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,305
I knew it's him

78
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:35,777
He killed all the procurers
and procuresses

79
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:39,044
Did he kill the man and save you?

80
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:48,419
How are you?

81
00:08:58,036 --> 00:09:00,596
How are you?

82
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:08,378
A boy without trousers! Return it to me!

83
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:12,115
Here...

84
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,215
When he reached the 2nd floor

85
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:25,391
I was already raped by that man

86
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:28,325
so bad!

87
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:31,335
I'll never stop blaming him for the
rest of my life

88
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:34,795
Why was he so late?

89
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,299
Come on, wear the trousers

90
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,208
Don't let your dick catch cold

91
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:42,940
Come on.No

92
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:45,077
Please wear it No

93
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:47,848
I traveled with him
from province to province

94
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,282
His foes kept on chasing us

95
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,121
he killed whoever came

96
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:58,256
Once he showed his sword,
he would not let anyone alive

97
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,964
Once he saw blood,he would never stop

98
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,724
Dare you do that again?

99
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:06,167
You are a big creep!Yes,l am a creep

100
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:07,530
How dare you?

101
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,800
I am sorry...
please don't hit me that heavily!

102
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:11,465
You are a big wolf!

103
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,344
Dare you do that again?

104
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:16,709
Please hit slightly!

105
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:19,213
How dare you? It's just for fun!

106
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,450
Dare you do that again?

107
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:22,019
Stop!Or I will be angry with you

108
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,344
Dare you do that again?

109
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,519
He killed and he lost his mind

110
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:31,187
He killed those deserved to be killed
and those who didn't

111
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:33,860
He killed men and beast too

112
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:36,295
He killed whatever
movable in front of him!

113
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:38,666
He couldn't forget seeing

114
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,670
that man raping me

115
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:43,036
He released himself by killing

116
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,107
For me. He became an insane killer

117
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:56,017
Shit...please don't cry!

118
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,153
Is your ass stabbed by the branches
inside the forest?

119
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,754
10 years ago,l was pregnant

120
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:02,417
I followed him to his station

121
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,188
I was going to deliver

122
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,730
When I was delivering,
I held his hand and said

123
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,561
I wish

124
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:09,656
there would be a Peace hotel

125
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:10,757
Once getting there

126
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:12,166
we won't be afraid of enemies' revenge

127
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,397
We needn't hide a gun under the pillow
when sleeping

128
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,204
Don't cry,this is my fault

129
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,774
I love you, kid,don't cry

130
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,706
He showed me the baby

131
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:25,978
That's the first time I saw our son

132
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:28,852
His little eyes were not yet opened

133
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:31,613
He was sucking his own little fists

134
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:36,192
Suddenly!

135
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,255
Bang!

136
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,536
Promise me,
don't tell your mom about the trousers

137
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,501
All right?Promise me please

138
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,903
Come on,have a kiss

139
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:54,134
Come on,have a kiss

140
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,377
Come on,l am sorry,
come on,let me kiss you

141
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:06,686
He killed everyone in the station,
so what?

142
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:08,989
He opened the Peace Hotel

143
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:11,289
Because of my words,so what?

144
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:12,726
He saved

145
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:15,265
so many people's lives in these 10 years
so what?

146
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:18,900
Our son was still the same...

147
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,130
He was dead!

148
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:28,474
Mistress,please give Boss a chance

149
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:33,147
He is totally different now!

150
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:37,512
He is so nice to people!

151
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:40,455
Say us,we dare not go out of the station

152
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,254
So he go buying food himself

153
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,088
In these 10 years,he is quite lonely

154
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,720
He hasn't known any other women

155
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:49,265
My son is his only playmate Yeah!

156
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:52,267
He regrets so much!
Why not give him a chance?

157
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,496
Right,Mistress,
please give Boss a chance

158
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:08,884
Stop!

159
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:11,688
Boss...

160
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,753
I forgot to buy your mom medicine
for hemorrhoid piles

161
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,057
She will babble again!

162

163
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:21,760

164
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:26,260
Boss...

165
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:27,463
Don't blame me!

166
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:28,561

00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,039
It's not surprise for me
to forget one or two

169
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:34,436
Never mind!

170
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:36,541
Someone will keep you warm at night soon

171
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,677

Thank you...

177
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:55,782
I am sorry to hide inside your room

178
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:58,325
Are you the Mistress

179
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,954
who our Boss has waited for 10 years?

180
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:06,126
What mistress?I am a fake

181
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,169
All people are nasty here

182
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,576
Don't you worry your identity
would be disclosed?

00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:18,373
No,my family will come here soon

184
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,274
Do you know my surname?

185
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:21,316
Soong

186
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:24,845
Soong Tze-wen is my elder brother

187
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:29,821
Soong Ching-ling and Soong Mei-ling
are my sisters

188
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,524
I've been here for ages

189
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,723
I don't know much
about the outside world

190
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,699
How about Chiang Kai-shek and
Sun Yat-sen?

191
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:42,133
They are my brother-in-laws

192
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,238
They are financially supported
by our family to the president

193
00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:46,242
And the Generalissimo

194
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,979
I just know the Emperor Ping of the
Soong Dynasty

195
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:51,673
And a guy named Soong who delivers food

196
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,708
Emperor Ping of the Soong Dynasty
is my dad

197
00:15:54,886 --> 00:15:56,717
The Soong who delivers food
is my grandpa

198
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,586
You are daughter of the Emperor Soong?

199
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,191
So,are you a princess?

200
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:04,158
Can't you imagine that?

201
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:20,303
Well! Can you lend me...

202
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:22,811
some money to rent a room?

203
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:27,450
When my family comes,
I will pay you 10 times of it

204
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:28,746
How much do you want?

205
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,587
As much as you can

206
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:31,856
If you lend me more

207
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,924
maybe,l can let you be an official

208
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:37,083
Thank you

209
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:41,763
Well,may be I sleep with you

210
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,458
Just pay me some money

211
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:46,334
$10 by hours and $20 by night

212
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,731
If you think I am terrific,
get some clientsfor me

213
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,330
I will give you commission

214
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:53,942
No! The Boss of this hotel
is so stubborn

215
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:56,339
He won't let others hook and gamble here

216
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,810
Living here is like staying in prison

217
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,612
He won't let everyone
step out of the hotel

218
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:02,744
You'd better go after taking your bath

219
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:04,412
I'll leave your some coins

220
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,384
That's enough for you
to hire a store room

221
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:10,187
Why don't you counter offer a price?

222
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,157
What a dummy!

223
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:46,223
Pal,come on cheers!

224
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:33,372
Boss,don't kill me!

225
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,463
Mistress

226
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,602
Music!

227
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,075
Mistress...

228
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:12,445
You are so pretty!

229
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:15,478
I am not hungry

230
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,478
Open a bottle of wine for me please

231
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:19,488
And bring me some snacks for the wine

232
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:22,257
Take more bottles of wine here,
I will take them to my room later

233
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,794
And,bring more cigarettes for me please

234
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:26,760
Sit,you must be tired

235
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,234
Coming...

236
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,069
When I see Mistress wearing your clothes

237
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,476
I know you two have become reconciled

238
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,104
Yeah...

239
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:48,447
I've said, for woman

240
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:50,885
She will forget all hatred
after making love

241
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,513
Damn you creep!

242
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,361
Boss...

243
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:11,464
You have brought so many followers
while you are in fugitive

244
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:13,100
I can tell you are a big Boss

245
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,004
Have I seen you before?

246
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,043
I came here after sunset

247
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:22,214
Why do you come here?

248
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,680
I killed

249
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:25,420
miss,how about you?

250
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:26,946
Me?

251
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:29,693
I stole a piece of national treasure

252
00:20:29,827 --> 00:20:31,590
If you want it,just offer a price

253
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,561
See this fountain pen,
if you can take it out

254
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:41,137
And find a buyer,you will be rich!

255
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:42,567
Let me show you

256
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:44,965
Open like this

257
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:49,208
I have got one upstairs
which is of the same look

258
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,512
How can you compare yours with mine?

259
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:56,016
This pen was used by Emperor Hsin-feng

260
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,351
for signing insulting treaty

261
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,623
See this lighter

262
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:08,189
It's opened in this way

263
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:13,800
I have one which is of the same look

264
00:21:13,971 --> 00:21:16,405
How can you compare yours with mine?

265
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:22,036
You know? Lin Tsi-hsui
used this to burn the opium!

266
00:21:30,254 --> 00:21:32,119
This watch is great too!

267
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:33,312
What's its historical background?

268
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:34,789
Have you ever heard of Emperor Ping
of the Soong Dynasty?

269
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:36,016
Sure...

270
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:41,222
This was the favorable watch
of Emperor Ping

271
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:44,731
When he died,
he wanted this to be buried with him

272
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:45,958
Let me show you

273
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,802
Don't pull too hard

274
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,240
It's opened like this!

275
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:57,842
See!There is a picture of Emperor Ping!

276
00:22:03,654 --> 00:22:06,452
You swindled and then stole

277
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:08,048
Just take it back

278
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:10,954
And you want to rob too?

279
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:13,586
Please mind your words

280
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:16,163
You can't insult me like this

281
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,125
Do you know who I am?

282
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:20,995
The daughter of Emperor Ping

283
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:24,538
Dog,Bitch

284
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,543
Skinny Fook Sau

285
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:28,202
Yes,coming...

286
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,779
Who am l? Mistress

287
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:41,316
Anything wrong...Boss?

288
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:46,463
Nothing happened,let me help you

289
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,902
I am going to get changed

290
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,495
Take everything to my room later

291
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,507
What are you doing?

292
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,077
She is choked

293
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,112
Boss,
Mistress is choked by the sour plum

294
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:27,028
Don't you ever touch my stuff

295
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,276
Return everything you have stolen
from my room

296
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:55,763
My ring

297
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,103
What are you doing?

298
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:12,014
Behind the screen

299
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:18,180
How about sleeping with you
for the rent?

300
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,611
Where did you work,Seven Skies Nightclub
or Paramont Nightclub?

301
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,107
Paramont Nightclub

302
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,385
You know using the rouge
of Fa Heung Hall

303
00:24:52,423 --> 00:24:54,414
Wearing the cheongsam of the
Lo Kai Fook Tailor's

304
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:58,952
But you wear such ugly shoes

305
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,164
I don't think you have been a clubgirl
for long

306
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:02,630
Six months?

307
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:06,567
No.Five months

308
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:10,235
Why do you come here?Gambling?

309
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:17,772
Do you owe the loan shark money?

310
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,382
They want me to pay with my body

311
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,510
I paid and they didn't admit that

312
00:25:23,954 --> 00:25:25,979
I was so angry,
so I took a pair of scissors

313
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,081
I stabbed into the ass of the loan shark

314
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:30,751
That's why he sent someone to kill me

315
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:36,500
But,l know some rascals too

316
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:40,233
Maybe they can help me

317
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:41,664
Don't you want more trouble?

318
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,370
Do you want such person to help you?

319
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:45,374
And then you want to pay them by
your body too?

320
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:13,692
Take a seat

321
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,574
Are you Cantonese?

322
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:26,640
I have seen many Cantonese snacks
inside your bag

323
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:29,141
Do you have any family?

324
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:33,956
If you have a family,just go home

325
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,581
Stay here

326
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:37,490
if only you are utterly helpless

327
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:39,426
Tomorrow

328
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,962
there will be a train to the South
passing here at 6 am

329
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:43,890
Leave from the front yard

330
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:46,828
I hope you would get onto the train
alive

331
00:26:57,014 --> 00:26:58,504
Go and take a room downstairs

332
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:19,995
Thank you

333
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:52,159
Take this for your funeral,you asshole!

334
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,302
The water is cold,
do you know adding some hot water?

335
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:01,741
Bring some ginseng tea for us

336
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,948
You are blind,
you don't need to sleep,do you?

337
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:09,310
Mistress,we can't stand it any more

338
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,554
Let's play tonight

339
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:13,452
Yeah...

340
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:16,489
I lose much money

341
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:18,991
Well

342
00:28:19,396 --> 00:28:21,296
just forget the money I owe you,
is that alright?

343
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:23,229
No way...

344
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:24,857
So,keep on betting

345
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,106
Don't cry in front of me

346
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:03,764
Tell me!

347
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:05,535
What have you done before coming to
the Peace Hotel?

348
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:08,741
I used a pair of scissors to stab into
the ass of a small potato

349
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,510
Small potato?

350
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,581
The small potato has some followers

351
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:18,416
Get out

352
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:16,576
Don't you think they come for me?

353
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:19,208
I am not that capable

354
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:22,149
Shau Siu-man,you killed our senior

355
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,911
Get out of here at once!

356
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,648
Who is Shau Siu-man?

357
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,452
Who killed their senior?

358
00:30:30,794 --> 00:30:31,920
Confess now!

359
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:34,054
The one in red cheongsam

360
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,597
The on in red pyjamas! Oh,it's you!

361
00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:40,533
Not me...None of my business

362
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,373
Aren't they coming foryou?

363
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,739
Of course not!

364
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:48,942
If I was wrong,
I would have been your servant!

365
00:31:02,893 --> 00:31:03,791
Right

366
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:05,384
I stabbed the one
who is lying on the cart

367
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:08,556
But I did stab his ass twice only

368
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,933
He could chase after me for a long way
by that time

369
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,963
I didn't know why he was dead suddenly

370
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,709
What are you doing? Drop the gun

371
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:30,777
Haven't you fought enough before?

372
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:02,580
Are you the Killer?

373
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:19,735
The bitch inside you hotel

374
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:20,961
killed our boss

375
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:22,663
Hand her out at once

376
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,546
That bitch stabbed him with a pair of
scissors first

377
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:41,851
Then she took his gun
and treated him with 7 shots

378
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,325
She stole 30 gold bars
from our Grand Hall

379
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:46,290
I don't care

380
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,988
whether she killed you boss or not

381
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:50,530
since I opened the Peace Hotel

382
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,726
I don't wish anyone

383
00:32:52,836 --> 00:32:54,497
to mess up my place

384
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:57,535
If you respect the dead,
take him away now

385
00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:59,268
Bury him as soon as possible

386
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,638
Don't you think this rusty sword...

387
00:33:01,745 --> 00:33:02,973
could forbid us

388
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:04,444
from taking the woman and the gold?

389
00:33:04,548 --> 00:33:06,413
We are all killers

390
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,515
How many people have you ever killed?

391
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,384
Our boss has killed as many as you did

392
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,383
But I am different from you!

393
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:19,858
Everyone saw me killing

394
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,121
If you don't hand me the woman
and the gold

395
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:23,830
I will come and get her myself

396
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:25,098
and I would like to see

397
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:26,794
whether you can kill all of us or not!

398
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:31,170
If you are so single minded,
I have nothing to say

399
00:33:31,975 --> 00:33:33,806
I can't rehearse killing in front of you

400
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,137
I have to ensure

401
00:33:36,246 --> 00:33:37,338
the safety of everyone
staying in the Peace Hotel

402
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:43,614
If you want to get her by force,
I am glad to play with you

403
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,131
If I can't kill that woman
within 21 days

404
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:02,966
I will disperse my Grand Hall

405
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,240
When will you send me away?

406
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,339
It's a piece of cake for me
to kick you away

407
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:15,575
Search the place
where she has ever been

408
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:16,846
See whether she did hid the gold of the
Grand Hall or not

409
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:17,943
Yes!

410
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:18,646
If I had gold

411
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:19,483
I wouldn't have been that helpless now

412
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,217
Mistress,you should be blamed!

413
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,953
Why did you mess up with those bastards?

414
00:34:24,494 --> 00:34:27,190
In these ten years,l have been alone...

415
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:28,826
Do you still pretend to the Mistress?

416
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,533
Isn't she the Mistress?

417
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:34,000
Isn't she the woman who you have waited
for 10 years?

418
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:35,466
I haven't waited for any woman

419
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,602
If anyone pretends to be my woman again

420
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:38,868
just kick her out of here

421
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,370
Aren't you the Mistress?

422
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:42,877
How about the money you borrowed?

423
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,978
Return my money...

424
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:56,618
If that woman comes out,just kill her

425
00:35:08,438 --> 00:35:12,568
Get lost!Go and clean the floor,
you bitch!

426
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:19,044
Clean the toilet later!

427
00:35:19,616 --> 00:35:20,844
Wash the bowls

428
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,451
Prepare the dinner!

429
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,547
And make soup for us!

430
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:18,697
Boss,why not hand that woman to them?

431
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,037
Yeah...

432
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:21,505
Good idea

433
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:24,405
If your foe comes tomorrow

434
00:36:24,514 --> 00:36:25,845
I will hand you out too

435
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,941
I am sorry.I don't mean it

436
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:31,984
Boss doesn't want to kick the woman away

437
00:36:32,122 --> 00:36:33,646
He must have slept with her last night

438
00:36:38,762 --> 00:36:39,922
No need to wait,let's eat

439
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,922
Boss,let's eat.Let's eat

440
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:54,405
This what I can do

441
00:36:55,078 --> 00:36:56,545
You'd better send my away

442
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:57,836
so you won't have much trouble

443
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,518
Hold her Damn it!

444
00:37:07,424 --> 00:37:09,016
Make her drink every drops of it

445
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,001
My husband and my children...

446
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:33,706
They are waiting for me at home

447
00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:36,043
My husband has got lung disease

448
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,651
That's why I worked in the
Paramont Nightclub

449
00:37:42,225 --> 00:37:44,420
I miss my children so much!

450
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:55,535
Return the picture to Skinny

451
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:01,172
I forgot to bring my family picture
with me

452
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:22,060
Swear!

453
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:24,930
Then I will tell you a top secret

454
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:31,006
In fact,the Grand Hall doesn't aim
at me

455
00:38:33,376 --> 00:38:34,968
They just want my...

456
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,671
Confidential name list!

457
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,613
Don't you ever touch
Doggie's exercise book

458
00:38:48,825 --> 00:38:49,985
I've told you that's confidential!

459
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:52,622
Why did you peep at it?

460
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:13,543
Great!

461
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,416
She deserves it!

462
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:49,818
Can you claim yourself a human being?

463
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:52,081
Don't you ever bother me again

464
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,852
Everyone comes to the Peace Hotel for
they don't want to die

465
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,720
I haven't seen one

466
00:39:57,827 --> 00:39:59,317
who scares death as you do!

467
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,099
Since you have come here

468
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:17,076
you'd better regret

469
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:19,070
If you escape this time

470
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:20,774
I hope you to learn how
to be a human being

471
00:40:20,984 --> 00:40:22,212
Don't waste any time and effort

472
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:24,652
No matter what tricks will you play

473
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:26,319
I won't send you away

474
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:27,681
Go back to your room

475
00:41:25,048 --> 00:41:26,310
I know how foolish I am

476
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:28,375
They come here in order to pick on the
Peace Hotel

477
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,778
I didn't kill,l haven't stolen the gold

478
00:41:29,886 --> 00:41:31,376
Don't you think you needn't be killed
for stabbing that guy?

479
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:32,147
You know the truth

480
00:41:32,255 --> 00:41:34,189
But you didn't apologize to me

481
00:41:34,557 --> 00:41:36,855
And you are like the Buddha
to let me stay

482
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,321
When you are angry

483
00:41:38,428 --> 00:41:39,918
You just release your anger on me

484
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:40,928
You said I lied

485
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,191
in fact yours is the biggest lie!

486
00:41:42,465 --> 00:41:43,295
If you were pure

487
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,799
you would never have come to
the Peace Hotel

488
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:46,198
They don't trust you

489
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:47,167
If they break in

490
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,635
Can you kill them all?

491
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:49,329
Can you?

492
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:51,206
If you can,you won't bother anything!

493
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:53,239
You won't let me wait for death
right here!

494
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:54,365
The Killer opened the Peace Hotel

495
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:56,240
it's the biggest lie in the world!

496
00:41:58,148 --> 00:41:59,581
Do you want me to launch a massacre
after certain time

497
00:41:59,749 --> 00:42:01,876
so as to make you believe me
to be the Killer?

498
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:04,845
If you don't trust me,just go out and
let them kill you!

499
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:18,064
Hurry up...

500
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:26,331
Bring me wine

501
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:27,201
Wine!

502
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,046
Freeze

503
00:45:01,731 --> 00:45:03,164
Go...

504
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:16,868
Go!

505
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,051
If anyone dares to kill in my hotel

506
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:05,150
and around this station

507
00:46:05,528 --> 00:46:06,722
I will kill without mercy

508
00:46:08,264 --> 00:46:10,323
And I will kill the men who
followed with

509
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:12,457
as will as the man behind!

510
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,532
I will kill everyone in his gang too

511
00:46:15,171 --> 00:46:17,002
Just like the massacre launched on the
night of 10 years ago

512
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,939
Give way...

513
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,951
Place the tables together

514
00:46:30,453 --> 00:46:31,852
Go and help!

515
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:34,021
Go and take some medicine here

516
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:35,914
Put her on the table

517
00:46:38,227 --> 00:46:39,694
You'd better go out

518
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:46,100
Go out,don't bother us

519
00:46:46,202 --> 00:46:48,500
Go out first

520
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:36,310
Boss,she is dead

521
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,351
Boss,she is dead,it's real

522
00:48:19,154 --> 00:48:19,950
Get out

523
00:48:28,263 --> 00:48:30,128
Wake up...

524
00:48:30,265 --> 00:48:32,825
Wake up!

525
00:48:58,627 --> 00:49:00,060
She is alright,she is awake

526
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:45,303
Wonderful!Those bastards are gone

527
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,301
Wonderful...

528
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,240
Let's go and take a look

529
00:49:52,914 --> 00:49:54,575
Let's celebrate!

530
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,319
Come on...

531
00:50:04,726 --> 00:50:06,523
Bet,bet now

532
00:50:15,103 --> 00:50:17,628
Don't you have to work?

533
00:50:21,743 --> 00:50:22,767
Don't be so much!

534
00:50:22,877 --> 00:50:23,866
Yes,Boss

535
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:32,508
Come in

536
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:43,495
Boss,I've cooked some fish congee for
Miss Siu-man

537
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:45,758
Do you have to take care of Doggie?

538
00:50:45,867 --> 00:50:46,856
Yes.Just drop it there

539
00:50:46,968 --> 00:50:48,435
Thank you,Boss

540
00:51:09,424 --> 00:51:11,449
Small has appeared for 5 times
continuously

541
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,855
I want to bet $10 on Big

542
00:51:20,135 --> 00:51:23,127
Come on,bet now...

543
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:27,740
Bet $10 on big please.Alright

00:51:28,977 --> 00:51:30,171
Three sixs,all lose

545
00:51:32,213 --> 00:51:33,612
Well,we lose

546
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,855
Why didn't you scold me?

547
00:51:46,928 --> 00:51:47,917
I always ask those

548
00:51:48,029 --> 00:51:50,463
who come here to change his temper

549
00:51:51,866 --> 00:51:54,528
But I haven't changed by bad temper

550
00:51:55,537 --> 00:51:57,505
I have to learn how to be a human being

551
00:51:59,641 --> 00:52:01,506
Do you know how my dad taught his son?

552
00:52:04,846 --> 00:52:07,076
My dad was a war-lord,he had 4 wives

553
00:52:07,215 --> 00:52:09,206
When I was small

554
00:52:09,317 --> 00:52:10,807
he always held my hand to shoot those
he caught

555
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:14,186
I didn't know anything but just thought
it was funny

556
00:52:14,622 --> 00:52:18,149
He told me,if I killed one or two

557
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,495
I would be a killer,
I would be a nasty guy

558
00:52:21,796 --> 00:52:23,923
But when I killed thousands of people

559
00:52:24,032 --> 00:52:27,126
I would be a hero!A supreme hero

560
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:31,835
When I was twelve,
he was defeated by others

561
00:52:32,507 --> 00:52:35,499
His head was chopped off
by another hero

562
00:52:37,479 --> 00:52:40,642
I had nothing but had to run away

563
00:52:43,718 --> 00:52:45,515
Once I went into a village

564
00:52:46,488 --> 00:52:48,115
I was so hungry and I was sick

565
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,523
I stole a sweat potato from the field

566
00:52:52,527 --> 00:52:54,654
Suddenly a man rounded my neck with
a rope

567
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,492
I fell on the ground and was dragged
away by him

568
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,099
Before I was breathless,
I caught a bamboo

569
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:01,691
I stabbed him to death!

570
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:05,300
Later,l was surrounded by 6 strong men

571
00:53:05,507 --> 00:53:07,737
They beat be with farming tools

572
00:53:08,409 --> 00:53:10,309
At last,l killed them all

573
00:53:13,915 --> 00:53:15,610
Do you know...

574
00:53:16,184 --> 00:53:16,946
how the villagers treated

575
00:53:17,051 --> 00:53:18,678
the boy who killed 7 adults?

576
00:53:22,924 --> 00:53:24,585
I stayed in that village for
10 more days

577
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,925
No one dared to bully me

578
00:53:27,028 --> 00:53:29,019
Whatever I want to eat

579
00:53:29,364 --> 00:53:31,298
They didn't say a word

580
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,260
Before my departure

581
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,996
5 or 6 boys who were older than me

582
00:53:40,108 --> 00:53:41,666
wanted to follow me

583
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,637
At that moment

584
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,973
I strongly believed that my dad's
words were true

585
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:52,352
The following ten years

586
00:53:55,123 --> 00:53:56,613
I always remembered his words

587
00:53:57,926 --> 00:54:01,521
I built up my own gang

588
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,688
I killed numerous people

589
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,763
I became a notorious and horrible man

590
00:54:12,073 --> 00:54:13,870
Until that night...

591
00:54:19,814 --> 00:54:21,611
Was the real mistress

592
00:54:22,383 --> 00:54:26,285
killed on that night?

593
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:45,697
In fact,you are similar in many ways

594
00:54:46,774 --> 00:54:49,299
You smoke,
you drink and you love gambling

595
00:54:49,877 --> 00:54:51,538
You are so bold too!

596
00:54:56,718 --> 00:54:59,983
But when she sang on stage

597
00:55:01,155 --> 00:55:04,682
Terrific!She is so charming!

598
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:15,097
Come on,have some congee first

599
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,205
Come on

600
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:24,703
Isn't it delicious?

601
00:55:25,813 --> 00:55:26,802
Delicious?

602
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:30,881
Old man,do you want to go?

603
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,447
The killer shouldn't save that woman

604
00:55:33,554 --> 00:55:34,885
If I were the man from the Grand Hall

605
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,284
I'd come back for revenge

606
00:55:37,425 --> 00:55:39,484
You big mouth!Go to hell

607
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,595
I've said Old Man will leave!

608
00:55:41,696 --> 00:55:42,594
You lose $10

609
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:45,731
Stranger,do you want to leave?
What's wrong?

610
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:48,267
The Peace Hotel is not peaceful at all,
that's why I have to leave

611
00:55:48,403 --> 00:55:50,132
Why don't you say a word to Boss?

612
00:55:50,672 --> 00:55:52,663
What should we say?We paid every penny,
you remember?

613
00:55:53,608 --> 00:55:54,734
Go!

614
00:55:57,478 --> 00:55:59,241
Go to hell

615
00:56:08,389 --> 00:56:09,321
Ask them to come back

616
00:56:10,091 --> 00:56:12,719
Boss,they paid all the rent

617
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:45,924
The men from the Grand Hall haven't left

618
00:56:46,127 --> 00:56:47,651
Go Back...

619
00:56:47,962 --> 00:56:49,896
Hubby,take care of our son!

620
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:36,100
I was once lost and disappointed

621
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:42,432
Feeling puzzled and scared in the crowd

622
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:49,814
How can the lost one moor

623
00:58:51,185 --> 00:58:54,586
When I find this love

624
00:58:54,689 --> 00:58:57,783
I look forward to it

625
00:58:58,359 --> 00:59:04,525
I am enlightened by you

626
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:11,502
Igniting a candle in the dark

627
00:59:12,373 --> 00:59:18,573
You arouse my passion

628
00:59:19,313 --> 00:59:25,149
I am freed because of you

629
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:29,787
You change my destiny

630
00:59:30,057 --> 00:59:34,016
Accompanying the one who's crying

631
00:59:34,428 --> 00:59:37,397
The swing in the rain

632
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,899
Swinging just like my heart

633
00:59:41,435 --> 00:59:42,766
Change my fate

634
00:59:42,904 --> 00:59:47,864
Protect me from the snow

635
00:59:48,409 --> 00:59:54,405
I am lost no more

636
00:59:55,349 --> 01:00:01,754
I got into trouble in the past

637
01:00:02,456 --> 01:00:08,759
I was wrong but you heal my pain

638
01:00:09,463 --> 01:00:15,834
You are helping me

639
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:20,098
Nothing is impossible in my life

640
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:23,870
I sing this song in peace

641
01:00:24,612 --> 01:00:31,040
Thanks for re-creating me

642
01:00:58,846 --> 01:01:02,213
You change my destiny

643
01:01:02,416 --> 01:01:06,352
Accompanying the one who's crying

644
01:01:06,721 --> 01:01:09,815
The swing in the rain

645
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:13,324
Swinging just like my heart

646
01:01:13,828 --> 01:01:15,295
Change my fate

647
01:01:15,396 --> 01:01:20,424
Protect me from the snow

648
01:01:20,835 --> 01:01:27,035
I am lost no more

649
01:01:27,675 --> 01:01:33,841
I got into trouble in the past

650
01:01:34,682 --> 01:01:41,053
I was wrong but you heal my pain

651
01:01:41,856 --> 01:01:48,352
You are helping me

652
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:52,488
Nothing is impossible in my life

653
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:56,535
I sing this song in peace

654
01:01:56,971 --> 01:02:02,568
Thanks for re-creating me

655
01:02:03,944 --> 01:02:11,783
Thanks for loving me

656
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,045
Boss,why not dance with Miss Shau?

657
01:02:15,156 --> 01:02:17,124
Go dancing!Go!

658
01:02:17,224 --> 01:02:18,657
May I be excused?

659
01:02:24,165 --> 01:02:25,792
Go dancing...

660
01:02:48,122 --> 01:02:50,818
Shit!The men from the Grand Hall
come again!

661
01:02:51,459 --> 01:02:54,519
Boss,l am scared!

662
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:58,562
Damn it!What are you afraid of?

663
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,867
Most of the nasty people are living in
this Peace Hotel

664
01:03:03,671 --> 01:03:04,569
Music

665
01:03:18,018 --> 01:03:18,677
Our lives

666
01:03:18,786 --> 01:03:19,878
are saved by the Peace Hotel

667
01:03:19,987 --> 01:03:21,147
Come on,let's dance

668
01:03:21,355 --> 01:03:23,050
Let's dance and drink!

669
01:03:24,191 --> 01:03:25,488
How dare they mess up our only shelter?

670
01:03:25,659 --> 01:03:26,819
If 12 come,l will kill a dozen

671
01:03:26,961 --> 01:03:28,053
Let's dance

672
01:03:42,743 --> 01:03:43,801
I am sorry!

673
01:03:44,945 --> 01:03:46,936
This hotel made you become the scapegoat

674
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,439
I hope this hotel can save you

675
01:03:53,821 --> 01:03:55,220
Do you have a wish?

676
01:03:59,326 --> 01:04:03,194
Will you miss me like missing
your passed woman?

677
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:44,462
Go!

678
01:06:03,117 --> 01:06:05,711
Great!Send her away

679
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,287
You needn't care about us,
we won't be scared

680
01:06:54,568 --> 01:06:56,331
He will go back to the Peace Hotel

681
01:06:56,704 --> 01:06:57,261
Go

682
01:07:04,278 --> 01:07:05,210
Go...

683
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:08,375
Jump onto whatever train you see,
and never come back

684
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:10,246
If you send me away

685
01:07:10,351 --> 01:07:11,477
How about you and the hotel?

686
01:07:11,585 --> 01:07:12,517
I won't go

687
01:07:12,619 --> 01:07:15,247
Go!I don't want you to be beaten
to death again

688
01:07:15,422 --> 01:07:17,947
If you die,whatever I do will be useless

689
01:07:18,425 --> 01:07:20,325
If you like me,let's run away together

690
01:07:29,136 --> 01:07:30,125
Hold this.

691
01:09:34,094 --> 01:09:36,756
Beat him...

692
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,128
Have you beaten enough?

693
01:10:15,402 --> 01:10:17,893
I take that Shau Siu-man
did kill your buddy

694
01:10:18,038 --> 01:10:19,699
I haven't kept my promise
but send her away

695
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,505
This is my fault

696
01:10:23,744 --> 01:10:26,406
My hotel hasn't offended you

697
01:10:27,447 --> 01:10:29,074
You just want face do you?

698
01:10:30,117 --> 01:10:31,675
Now,you have gained what you wanted

699
01:10:32,386 --> 01:10:33,478
Forget it,alright?

700
01:10:36,123 --> 01:10:40,526
You are wrong!
That bitch did kill my buddy

701
01:10:40,661 --> 01:10:42,151
and she stole my gold

702
01:10:42,629 --> 01:10:44,722
But she isn't called Shau Siu-man

703
01:10:45,332 --> 01:10:46,663
She is called Lam Ling

704
01:10:47,267 --> 01:10:48,359
She is an actress

705
01:10:49,369 --> 01:10:50,631
She is a bitch!

706
01:10:51,371 --> 01:10:53,566
She is my woman,Ting Moon's woman

707
01:10:54,274 --> 01:10:56,742
She slept with all my buddies

708
01:11:09,456 --> 01:11:10,650
It's a piece of cake for me to catch her

709
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:13,416
But I let her alive intentionally

710
01:11:14,528 --> 01:11:16,052
That's why I sent her to the Peace Hotel

711
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,463
I just want her to flatter you

712
01:11:19,032 --> 01:11:20,829
To make you break your promise and
send her away

713
01:11:24,871 --> 01:11:27,533
If you get the gold,
you needn't return to me

714
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:31,473
She deserves it

715
01:11:34,948 --> 01:11:37,542
10 years ago,
your buddies risked their lives for you

716
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:39,482
Some of them betrayed you
but you killed everyone in your troop

717
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,349
10 years later,you open this hotel

718
01:11:41,455 --> 01:11:42,786
and you try to cover those scums

719
01:11:43,056 --> 01:11:44,717
Do you think you can face your buddies?

720
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:58,696
Red cheongsam

721
01:11:59,673 --> 01:12:01,538
Wine glass with lip-stick mark

722
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:05,503
You love her,
you are right to send her away

723
01:12:05,712 --> 01:12:07,179
If she couldn't cheat you
to send her away

724
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:09,010
I would have killed her

725
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:11,117
You were my follower

726
01:12:11,885 --> 01:12:13,819
You are the kid
whom I let go on that night

727
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:19,354
You did so many wrong things
on that night

728
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,452
Since you killed your wife

729
01:12:21,995 --> 01:12:23,326
you killed all your followers

730
01:12:24,064 --> 01:12:26,123
you should not let a kid go

731
01:12:26,366 --> 01:12:29,392
Even your wife allied with your buddies

732
01:12:29,503 --> 01:12:30,800
to set a trap to kill you!

733
01:12:31,004 --> 01:12:32,631
You should have been killed 10 years ago

734
01:12:42,883 --> 01:12:44,475
All of you listen!

735
01:12:45,419 --> 01:12:49,412
If you don't want to die,
come out before sunset

736
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:52,224
Otherwise

737
01:12:52,693 --> 01:12:54,524
I will launch a massacre in
the Peace Hotel after sunset

738
01:12:59,032 --> 01:13:00,693
Boss...

739
01:13:01,702 --> 01:13:03,693
Get the medicine...

740
01:13:04,438 --> 01:13:06,633
I'm alright...

741
01:13:07,407 --> 01:13:08,396
You shouldn't take any medicine

742
01:13:08,508 --> 01:13:09,372
He didn't counter attack

743
01:13:09,476 --> 01:13:10,773
That's why he was seriously hurt

744
01:13:10,944 --> 01:13:13,242
Why didn't you counter attack?

745
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,278
Why do you drag us down?

746
01:13:16,416 --> 01:13:18,441
Why did you send that woman away?

747
01:13:18,585 --> 01:13:20,382
They want to kill us all!

748
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,384
Skinny

749
01:13:21,488 --> 01:13:22,648
You saved a woman

750
01:13:22,756 --> 01:13:24,656
and you want to pay our lives for it

751
01:13:25,058 --> 01:13:26,650
You betray us for a woman!

752
01:13:28,662 --> 01:13:31,153
We have been following you

753
01:13:31,264 --> 01:13:32,697
for years

754
01:13:32,799 --> 01:13:34,824
you haven't sent any one of us away

755
01:13:35,502 --> 01:13:36,833
Are you crazy?

756
01:13:37,304 --> 01:13:40,330
If not were Boss,if not were this hotel

757
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,438
all of you would have been killed
for ages!

758
01:13:42,576 --> 01:13:43,838
You charge us!

759
01:13:44,077 --> 01:13:46,375
We charge $4 a day

760
01:13:46,513 --> 01:13:47,343
to provide you accommodation and food

761
01:13:47,447 --> 01:13:48,505
think we have to ensure your safety too?

762
01:13:48,615 --> 01:13:50,344
Damn you blind man!

763
01:13:50,817 --> 01:13:53,217
Don't fight!

764
01:13:55,255 --> 01:13:56,688
Shut up!

765
01:14:06,867 --> 01:14:08,232
I know you are all scared

766
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:12,598
If you listen to them and
go out of the hotel

767
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:16,000
I can't take care of your safety anymore

768
01:14:18,512 --> 01:14:19,774
Trust me once more

769
01:14:21,815 --> 01:14:23,783
If you stay in this hotel

770
01:14:24,851 --> 01:14:26,751
We can stay peace

771
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:33,817
Fook Sau

772
01:14:34,661 --> 01:14:36,128
Follow me to get the guns

773
01:14:53,513 --> 01:14:54,912
Fook Sau,lock the door

774
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:00,913
Don't kill me,don't kill me...

775
01:15:03,256 --> 01:15:04,723
Skinny,you can't go out

776
01:15:04,858 --> 01:15:07,622
You made mistake
and you want us to die with you?

777
01:15:08,161 --> 01:15:09,150
Don't go out!

778
01:15:09,262 --> 01:15:11,059
We are like prisoners to stay here
with you for 9 years

779
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:13,291
Do you want my family to die
with you now?

780
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,560
Dog,l beg you!

781
01:15:14,668 --> 01:15:15,760
You can't let Doggie go out,
he will be killed

782
01:15:15,869 --> 01:15:17,234
Who do you think you are?

783
01:15:17,337 --> 01:15:18,167
Let's go

784
01:15:18,271 --> 01:15:20,603
Boss...

785
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:23,300
Hands off...

786
01:15:23,677 --> 01:15:24,905
Doggie!

787
01:15:47,267 --> 01:15:49,997
Buddies,please bless me

788
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:58,539
Boss,don't blame them

789
01:15:58,945 --> 01:16:01,937
Those who come here
are all afraid of death

790
01:16:02,148 --> 01:16:04,810
If most of the people stay

791
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:08,549
three of us will have guts to stay

792
01:16:09,256 --> 01:16:11,417
I am sorry,Boss

793
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:15,654
You have trusted me for years

794
01:16:15,896 --> 01:16:17,454
Why can't you trust me one more time?

795
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:19,297
Either live or dead

796
01:16:19,566 --> 01:16:21,761
please let us choose it ourselves.Boss

797
01:16:22,469 --> 01:16:24,903
Sorry,Boss...

798
01:17:29,636 --> 01:17:30,967
You bastards!

799
01:17:33,974 --> 01:17:35,236
You promised not to kill us!

800
01:17:35,508 --> 01:17:38,306
Why do you kill us?

801
01:17:38,411 --> 01:17:39,537
Don't kill me!

802
01:17:43,883 --> 01:17:46,374
Go,run...run away!

803
01:17:49,389 --> 01:17:51,118
Run away!

804
01:17:55,528 --> 01:17:56,688
Get lost!

805
01:17:57,263 --> 01:17:58,890
Thank you for your gold

806
01:17:59,065 --> 01:18:00,293
Thank you for sending me
to the Peace Hotel

807
01:18:01,234 --> 01:18:02,724
Thank you for sending me to hell

808
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:05,635
So I can tell

809
01:18:05,739 --> 01:18:06,728
who is the heartless creep

810
01:18:07,173 --> 01:18:08,663
And who is the real man!

811
01:18:09,175 --> 01:18:10,335
I am now getting into the Peace Hotel

812
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:12,100
If you like,beat me to death again

813
01:18:47,781 --> 01:18:48,543
Go!

814
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:47,562
Doggie,run!

815
01:21:40,286 --> 01:21:43,949
Boss,please don't kill me!No!

816
01:25:43,396 --> 01:25:47,856
Wake up,please wake up!

817
01:27:00,373 --> 01:27:02,068
The Peace Hotel is no longer the same

818
01:27:02,675 --> 01:27:04,666
for the Killer is gone

819
01:27:06,245 --> 01:27:09,339
We,betrayed the hotel for our lives

820
01:27:09,549 --> 01:27:11,346
have to run our own ways

821
01:27:18,658 --> 01:27:20,626
Boss...

822
01:27:21,427 --> 01:27:23,725
That was the last time I saw Boss

823
01:27:24,964 --> 01:27:26,397
After that

824
01:27:26,532 --> 01:27:28,591
I hid with my parents in a little
fishing port in the South

825
01:27:28,968 --> 01:27:31,664
Two years later,our foes came to us

826
01:27:31,771 --> 01:27:33,238
They killed my parents

827
01:27:34,006 --> 01:27:36,634
As I know,other people say the blind men

828
01:27:36,776 --> 01:27:41,645
Fook,Sau and Skinny,
they had similar endings

829
01:27:42,381 --> 01:27:44,815
Iater,
I have heard many gossips about Boss

830
01:27:45,284 --> 01:27:47,309
Someone said he saw Boss
in North East China

831
01:27:47,553 --> 01:27:49,680
Someone said,in a station of the North

832
01:27:49,855 --> 01:27:51,345
Boss helped a young widow

833
01:27:51,457 --> 01:27:53,982
and her son in the hotel she operated

834
01:27:54,493 --> 01:27:56,017
I hope

835
01:27:56,162 --> 01:27:57,754
either one stories is true

836
01:27:57,997 --> 01:27:59,828
Although I did see

837
01:27:59,966 --> 01:28:02,298
my friend leave me on that day
