1
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:39,039
You do realize why you're in this car,
do you not?

2
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:43,715
You've been tasked by Mr. Durant
to build a bridge.

3
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,935
Any man can lay track.
Am I correct?

4
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,258
Yes, ma'am.
Pretty near.

5
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,656
Then can you explain
why you've been spending

6
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:53,608
all your energy at rail's end

7
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:55,055
instead of at the bridge site?

8
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,683
That will be remedied, ma'am.

9
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,372
Thank you.

10
00:01:01,825 --> 00:01:03,034
[Sighs]

11
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,524
You heard what the lady said.

12
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,445
This the part where I tell you the men
don't like taking orders from a woman.

13
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,293
They don't have to like it.

14
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:13,762
No, they don't.

15
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:16,080
But if you're looking to get back
in Mr. Durant's good graces,

16
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:19,205
then pissing off the man
might not be the best tact.

17
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,124
Doesn't matter,
as long as we get this rail road built.

18
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,688
[Chuckles] If you're not
careful, miss bell,

19
00:01:23,713 --> 00:01:26,141
you're going to start sounding like a man.

20
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:28,506
Right.

21
00:01:32,238 --> 00:01:34,406
[Men shouting]

22
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:44,450
[Train whistle blowing]

23
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:50,111
All right! Move your carcasses!

24
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:58,964
Step on it!

25
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,792
You lot, for the gorge,

26
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,253
make room for one more.
And as for the rest of you

27
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,152
jackanapes, I expect to be able
to walk a mile of rail

28
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:13,355
by the time I get back from me lunch break.

29
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,135
[Indistinct chatter]

30
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,108
Change the numbers all you want,
that ain't the problem.

31
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:18,827
56 men?

32
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:20,478
23.

33
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:24,461
And we've got another 46 coming in.
Another...

34
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:27,356
[Man screaming and sobbing]

35
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,702
[Screaming and sobbing continues]

36
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,542
That's got to be Fleming.
The sentry?

37
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,598
You need to do something.

38
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:54,925

[Sobbing continues]

41
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:14,779
Bring me the long rifle.

42
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,531
There's too many!
They got the high ground.

43
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,001
If you keep them occupied,

44
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:19,867
we can loop back and try and outflank 'em.

45
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,620
Damn it, I said bring me
the long rifle right now!

46
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:31,170
Get back.

47
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:35,477
[Sobbing continues]

48

Look at me.

56
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:23,365
I see you.

[Both gasping and moaning]

Never thought I'd be glad

63
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,605
Mr. Toole made foreman.

64

Out early, home late.

65
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:11,246
Don't speak his name.

66

Damn, girl.

That little bump?

You and me made that.

How you know?

78
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:09,844
Because I know.

79
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:27,698
Say something.

80

and you tell me what you're thinkin'.

Don't you leave here
without saying something.

83
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,890
I can't.

why these men ain't at work?

Then you come back in
and drink to his memory.

126
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,669
We parlayed.
We all agree.

127
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,088
It's not safe.

128
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,705
It's about to get unsafe around here

129
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,708
if you don't get your ass back to work.

130
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,012
I am afraid you'll just have to shoot us.

131
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,347
That's right!

132
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:55,978
{pub}If we route South,

133
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:58,647
then we can bridge the river here...

And avoid the entire issue of Sacred Land.

135
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:02,909
Yes.

136
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:05,771
At considerable expense.

137
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:07,790
Spend a few more pennies now

138
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:09,458
and keep your work force, Thomas.

140
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,588
We can't run from the Sioux.

141
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:14,716
If it ain't this gorge,
it'll be the next one.

142

- The men are afraid to work.
- Then we should find ones who ain't.

143
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:21,098
They believe that if the Sioux
won't kill them, perhaps you will.

144
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,349
Bullshit.

145
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,810
Of course. When logic isn't on
your side, resort to the profane.

146

All right, I'll give you facts.

147

Here, here, here.

148
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,230
May not be sacred,
but it's all Sioux territory.

149
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,940
We've already established what's
on this side of the gorge!

150
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,901
For once, let's be smart.

151
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:38,131
Reroute and show the men that we can
steer them out of harm's way.

152
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,367
The Indians' home's at stake, young lady.

153
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,940
They'll fight us all
the way to the Rockies.

154
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,630
- If that's true, then we're lost!
- We turn tail first sign of trouble,

155
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:45,822
yes, we are.
You don't...

156
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:46,996
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

157
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:49,709
What is your plan, Mr. Bohannon?

158
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,617
Fight 'em here, fight 'em now.

159
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:53,869
With what? That rabble?

160
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:54,881
Them's the ones we got.

161
00:11:55,112 --> 00:11:56,589
[Chuckles] They...

162
00:11:56,714 --> 00:12:00,176
They won't even work for you.

163
00:12:00,301 --> 00:12:02,962
You let me worry about that.

164
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:05,517
Just don't reroute this rail road.

165
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:17,893
Let me.

166
00:12:18,018 --> 00:12:20,729
Thank you.

167
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:24,182
Your husband know about
what you told me earlier?

168
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:25,851
No.

169
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,454
Nobody knows but you and me.

170
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,823
Good.

171
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:34,710
I've spent my whole
life trying to get free.

172
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:37,924
Then here come a woman...
A white woman...

00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:40,968
A married woman, spinning my head

174

saying she's got my baby.

175
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,872
I couldn't think of nothin' to do but run.

176
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:49,842
Then it set with me.

177
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,543
And?

178
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:54,563
Any harm come to you,
I go weak in the head.

179
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:56,068
You are weak in the head.

180
00:12:56,306 --> 00:12:57,516
All the gold eagles in the world

181
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:59,268

00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,526
I respect that.

545
00:40:57,412 --> 00:40:58,981
Rifle in your left hand,
cartridge in your right.

546
00:40:58,982 --> 00:41:00,826
Join the line.
Arms distance, please.

547
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,069
You think this is unwise?

548
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,921
Probably.

549
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,757
But this is...

550
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,427
Barrels down, gentlemen.

551
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,804
But a necessary evil, Mr. Toole.

552
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,140
You're speaking of
yourself then, Mr. Bohannon.

553
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:17,924
[Scoffs]

554
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,776
[Grunting]

555
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,035
Rifle in your left hand.

556
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:38,245
Cartridges in your right.

557
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,336
Congratulations.

558
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,801
All right, gentlemen.
The rest of y'all,

559
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,803
rifles in your left hand,
barrels facing the sky.

560
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,743
Finger off the trigger.
Take one cartridge in your right hand.

561
00:41:56,868 --> 00:41:57,987
Sharp end is the business end.

562
00:41:58,112 --> 00:41:59,509
Load that cartridge into the cartridge port

563
00:41:59,634 --> 00:42:01,127
on the side of your rifle,
business end first.

564
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,294
Now, on the order to make ready,

565
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,980
rack that lever all the way forward

566
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,032
and all the way back,
loading the round into the chamber.

567
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:08,134
And... make ready!

568
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:09,110
[Guns click]

569
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,189
You dropped your round.

570
00:42:13,314 --> 00:42:14,574
[Laughter] Pick it up.

571
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:16,826
Start again.

572
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,861
And... make ready!

573
00:42:18,986 --> 00:42:20,580
[Gun click]

574
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,828
[Horse neighs]

575
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,544
Boss man coming through.
Hold your fire.

576
00:42:34,669 --> 00:42:36,137
Boss man coming through!

577
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,855
Anything moves...

578
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,398
Shoot the shit out of it.

579
