1
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,087
Come on, boys, yah, yah!

2
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,319
Let's go!

3
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,138
Look at 'em, Cage!

4
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,335
Ready to bust loose!

5
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,145
Pretty soon they'll be jumpin' fences

6
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,882
Tomorrow we'll let 'em run, not today

7
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:28,580
A little rustle in the air, boys,
time to get inside!

8
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,585
Ain't they somethin', Billy?

9
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,922
Have you ever seen horses like 'em?

10
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,427
Not quite

11
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,089
Come on, get inside!

12
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,110
Let's get into town
and out before this hits.

13
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,360
Jacob! How's the missus?

14
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,933
Glad to see ya!

15
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,164
Hey, sir. Hey!

16
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,421
Hello, Mr. Ballard

17
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:37,981
Howdy

18
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:45,992
My God! Looks like half the association's
shown up. We appreciate it, gentlemen

19
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,296
Mr. Ballard, we're gonna win this fight!

20
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,901
Thank you! And you, sir

21
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,772
Good luck to ya, Ballard, for cuttin'
Carey Sartin off from water.

22
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,611
You just bought that tract to spite him

23
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,915
Morgan! Pete!

24
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,974
Well, lookey here

25
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,316
Ya didn't need it!
Hope it makes ya fell good

26
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,149
You sayin' a man can't buy land when he wants to?

27
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,150
I'm sayin' Carey's hard workin'

28
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,322
I think you've gone a little bit too far this time
Ballard

29
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,659
Now come on, Shelby

30
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:24,460
Let's be friends, huh? Nobody wants
that old rock garden of yours anyway

31
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,929
Be friends. Hm?

32
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,786
C'mon!

33
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,425
Kermit Dover! Get out here!

34
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,584
Excuse me a moment on a sweet Sunday when I
oughta be home restin' my poor old bones

35
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,361
and you makin'
a fuss over a petition for statehood

36
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,231
Where'd you get this idea?

37
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,365
Oh, it's in from Cheyenne, all official

38
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,961
Henry

39
00:03:59,005 --> 00:03:59,937
Who says it's official?

40
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,770
Judge Wilkins seen it,
that good enough for you?

41
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,708
There's a delegation comin' in from Washington

42
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,404
in a month to make Cheyenne the capital city

43
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,141
Look who signed up, Slater!

44
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:08,909
Hunter Jarvis

45
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:12,748
Big and bold like a John Hancock

46
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,946
That Slater
Morrison looks like he's sideways on alcohol

47
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,957
Now you suppose
he just forgot the good turn we done him

48
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,154
when he got flooded out last
Spring and the bank said no?

49
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:26,589
Hunter?
I need to remind you of somethin', Hunter!

50
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,998
Hunter has gone!

51
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,935
Oh, he probably heard
I was gonna come and reason with him

52
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,029
What do you think about that, Ollie?

53
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,437
Look like a three-dollar bill to me

54
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,635
Mr. Ballard

55
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,837
Uh, Myrl, how 'bout you?

56
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,176
You're a smart young man with a future,
where do you stand?

57
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,239
Statehood ain't worth fussin' over

58
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,841
Cora, let me help you

59
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,078
Thank you

60
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,017
Is that so?

61
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:51,046
It's gonna happen. No matter what next year,
five years from now

62
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,558
I wouldn't waste your sweet Sunday
worryin' about it, wait it out is my thought

63
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,756
And the vermin'll sweep in like a grass fire

64
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:02,132
The only people I see around here
are hard workin' Eye sores and riff-raff

65
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,136
You talkin' about me?

66
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,640
Whadya say, Cora, do I look like an eyesore?

67
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:12,111
No, sireeee, you're a handsome man
and my sweetheart forever

68
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,504
Smart little lady

69
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,276
Honey, Cage is waitin' for us.
We gotta get movin'

70
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,614
Hey, you're a horse trader?

71
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,983
You pull your weight in town
unlike some other folks

72
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,717
But I don't need no strangers
from Cheyenne come in

73
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,282
and tell me who I got to neighbor with...

74
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,454
...Where to put my road, my fence

75
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,554
tell me what's mine, and what ain't

76
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,425
I founded Rawlins, I made it!

77
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,032
I thought Indian traders
and trappers come here first

78
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,811
I put my roots and my law done here, boy,
when you still just a pup

79
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,981
I got a wife and two sons in the ground

80
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,013
Now your bein' new to the territory

81
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,651
Maybe you oughta plant your feet
and take a stand

82
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,594
Well, to say the truth, I wasn't gonna...

83
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,620
sign the petition for statehood

84
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,360
I didn't think it was that important

85
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,494
But since you put my character to the test,
y'hand me that paper you got there,

86
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,094
Kermit, and a pencil

87
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,002
Sure

88
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,495
Here you go

89
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:15,771
I'm a free man like you, Ballard

90
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,834
I can say yes, and I can say no

91
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,345
I say yes to statehood

92
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,625
I bought a lot of horses from you, boy

93
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,618
From now on, maybe you oughta try
to sell 'em in Cheyenne

94
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,062
If you can get there

95
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,191
Doesn't matter one way or the other where
I sell 'em, Mr. Ballard

96
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,725
I give you the same fair price
I give everybody.

97
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,436
Now if you got some other stand you'd like me
to take I'd be more than glad to accommodate you

98
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,037
Let's go, Myrl. Will ya, please

99
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,240
let's go!

100
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,909
Good afternoon

101
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,815
Thanks, Myrl

102
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:00,648
Myrl

103
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:01,584
See ya, Myrl

104
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,645
Bye, Cora

105
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,121
Take care, Myrl

106
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,141
You didn't sell no horses today

107
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,613
I said what was true

108
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,175
You don't always have to say what's true

109
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,181
I'll do better at the auction in Casper

110
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,120
That man's sure got a bug up his twirl

111
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,554
He's runnin' for somethin', isn't he?

112
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,115
You showed him up in front of town,
he ain't gonna forget that

113
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,786
Ah, he'll get over it

114
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,193
Come on, boys.

115
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,124
Right over here!

116
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,381
I know how ya feel

117
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,083
But that's the way it is with
the horse trade, Cage

118
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,924
Grow to love the animals you raise

119
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,588
but there comes a time
when you gotta sell them

120
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,227
We need cash to run the farm,
pay wages, y'know?

121
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,097
That's the way it is

122
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,072
You got it, that's the way it is

123
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,900
But be happy with what you and Billy did,

124
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,639
theses are beautiful stallions,
beautiful horse flesh

125
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,044
You're gonna make Clay Williams happy

126
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,481
and we're gonna earn
a profit to buy the land we need

127
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,213
Right?

128
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,345
Yeah

129
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,284
Y'see that dog? You wash him

130
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,625
I'll sell him, too

131
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,230
Come on, now! Get on it!

132
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,757
Safe trip

133
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,967
Be back in few weeks, sooner if
the weather holds

134
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,336
Take care of your momma, Cage

135
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,343
Sure, Pa

136
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,072
Surprise me with a present, Myrl

137
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,136
Like what?

138
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,580
Ooh, like, uh, uh, some nice soap

139
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,210
uh, maybe something sweet, and, uh...

140
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,447
Oh, uh, uh, a bicycle!

141
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:19,857
And, and some of those fancy bloomers
from the Sears Roebuck catalog!

142
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,658
And, and an Otis elevator like they
have at the World's Fair in Paris

143
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,687
Oh! And don't forget lamp oil!

144
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,130
What?

145
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,157
Don't forget lamp oil!

146
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,133
Lamp oil!

147
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,872
Otis Elevator!

148
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,964
Come on, now! Step up!

149
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:44,343
Hey, Myrl!
Has Woody always been a dusty old cuss?

150
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,816
As far as I know

151
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:51,819
Hey, Billy, I was thinkin'when
I get to Casper, I just might grab me a bath

152
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,296
Come on now, step up! Here we go!

153
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:12,506
Step up now, come on!
Straight on through, come on now step up!

154
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,774
On time, straight on through now

155
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,251
Step up! Come on, get on up there!

156
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,864
How you figure that, Myrl?

157
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:38,267
C'mon

158
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,201
Good lookin' fence you got,
Slater, what's it for?

159
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,404
Keep rustlers out, mistah

160
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,712
I didn't know Ballard owned this land

161
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,181
Yeah, he bought a new parcel,

162
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,616
it's all official. Paper 'n all

163
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,552
It's cost you ten dollars to come through

164
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,986
Ten dollars?

165
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,148
Yes, sir

166
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,487
This pass is closed, Mr. Redding

167
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,322
You ought not got too far, Ballard

168
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,850
How's that?

169
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,825
Puttin' up a fence and chargin'

170
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,890
Well, rustler like to slip in pick off strays

171
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:08,991
I get the fence, all right

172
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,366
but what about the ten dollars?

173
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,700
Keeps the riff-raff out

174
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,102
You're makin' trouble, is all

175
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,471
Look, I got no cause with you horse traders,

176
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,669
you come and go as you like

177
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,010
Where are you headed?

178
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,479

179
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,347

00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,645

They's sold

183
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,257
A little knot-headed, but put a pistol to my head,

184
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,164
I'd give ya... fifty each

185
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,391
What do you think, Ollie?

186
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,698
We need work horses

187
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:48,764
Yeah, we do, and since you ain't
heard the new rules 'till now

188
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,208
I'd be willing to let you come and go two

189
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,474
no three times, for one of them blacks

190
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,146
No sale

191
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,707
Then it'll cost you ten dollars to pass,
pay Slater

192
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,116
I ain't got ten dollars to give cause

193
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,676
I gonna pay for food and lodgin' in Casper

194
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,779
Then go around

195
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,814
I go around and the auction's over before
I get there!

196
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,622
That ain't my doin'. Ten dollars

197
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,056
Ooh, I near forgot

198
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,587
You're gonna need a permit

199
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,998
You gotta have one, gotta be... official

200
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,026
I musta crossed here
fifty times without a permit,

201
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,662
where am I supposed to get a permit?

202
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,173
Well, you can see Judge Wilkins in Rawlins,

203
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,369
or you could, uh get one in Casper

204
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,676
Yeah. Elmo Whitaker
in Casper he'll write you one up

205
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,739
You know Elmo, dontcha?

206
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,258
I'll give you five down, the rest when
I come back. Good enough?

207
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,090
How do we know you're comin' back this way?

208
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,619
Because I said I would

209
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:48,099
Maybe the horse dealer
could put up some security

210
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,268
Hm. Now that is a good thought, Ollie

211
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,738
You know, uh, I try to be a reasonable man

212
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,400
I'll go along with ya.

213
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,707
Just leave the two blacks
and pick 'em up on your way back

214
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,109
Take it or leave it, I ain't got all day

215
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,286
Billy, cut the blacks off the string and leave 'em

216
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,884
Don't leave the stallions here, Myrl

217
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,761
You can put up the roans if you have to
the blacks is promised to Clay Williams

218
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:23,997
Leave 'em, or go the long way around

219
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,671
Don't do it, Myrl

220
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,145
I ain't got no choice

221
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,548
I ain't got the money,
and the auction's in a week

222
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,019
You stay with them, Billy

223
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,179
we'll pick you up on the way back

224
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,813
I ain't feedin' no Crow

225
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,188
Naw, he gotta sleep in the barn

226
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,920
Take what you need from the pack horse

227
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:54,421
Been a real pleasure doin'
because with you, Mr. Redding

228
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,434
Let 'em through, Slater

229
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,730
Son of a bitch!

230
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:02,039
Hey, come on now! Let's turn this thing over
and get this outta the way!

231
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,235
Mr. Redding's gotta come through

232
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,421
No way! He's gone too far

233
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,358
Pretty soon we'll be goin' around
the Rio Grand to get to Casper!

234
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:21,859
I mean, if he thinks...

235
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,191
Hey, Myrl?

236
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,287
What?

237
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,456
Y'know, there ain't no use payin'

238
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,397
Attention to that old man

239
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,963
Whadya make of all this?

240
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,439
Like a church with no roof

241
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,601
Got the Almighty braggin' his head off

242
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,111
Yeah. Whadya figure he's sayin'?

243
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,541
Remember who did this?

244
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,908
Don't get too big for your britches.

245
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,316
I guess

246
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,318
Fair enough

247
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,851
CASPER

248
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,799
Hey! 171, 80. Look at this...

249
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,533
Now 80, now 90!

00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,238
One, two hundred dollars...

251
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,902
Howdy, Browder!

252
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:14,975
Myrl!

253
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,311

254
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,111

255
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:19,511
Whadya say, Partner?

256
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,415

Good to see ya!

258
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,451
Here we go, there it is

259
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,512
Hey

260
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:24,782
Yes indeed-y

261
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,915
Yes

262
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,484
Where's the stallions?

263
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,925
Henry Ballard got 'em

264
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,929
I thought Myrl promised them to Clay Williams

265
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,658
Oh, well Ballard's holdin' onto them

266
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,428
as security 'till Myrl pays him
a toll for crossin' his property

267
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,796
I heard about that gate.
That one's crazy tryin' somethin' like that

268
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,771
Yeah. Myrl's pretty angry about it

269
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:41,704
I don't blame him

270
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,071
Hey, Browder, you...

271
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,133
...you ever hear tell of one of them
English dogs, one of 'em

272
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,906
Jack Russell Terrier dogs?

273
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,174
Can't say I have

274
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,613
Well, they say,
if'n you get 'em riled up enough,

275
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,776
and they sink their teeth into ya, well now

276
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:56,083
you're just gonna have
to saw theirjaw apart 'fore they let go

277
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,755
Well, that right there
is Myrl Redding right about now.

278
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,952
A man with a bull head and a Jack Russell jaw

279
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:01,925
Quite a sight. I'll see ya

280
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:03,552
Come on!

281
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,653
See ya later

282
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,328
He told you to see me?

283
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,891
That's what he said

284
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:12,335
He's fuckin' the dog on ya, Myrl

285
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,704
There ain't no such thing as
a pass for a pass.

286
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,364
He owns the land, all right,

287
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,604
he been buyin' land like
it's goin' outta style, but I don't know

288
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,978
what this permit crap is all about
Includin' that parcel around the pass?

289
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:23,845
Oh, yeah

290
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,247
So he can do what he wants with the land?

291
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:29,050
Unless the Governor steps in,
but that's a long wiggle down the road

292
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,922
How's business, Elmo?

293
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,185
Pretty good

294
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,954
Cheatin' the hell outta them, are you?

295
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,491
Only them that tries to cheat me

296
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,563
Take care

297
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,230
One hundred twenty five
and one half, one sixty, one seventy.!

298
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:47,864
Hundred and fifty seven, hundred
and sixty, hundred and eighty...

299
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,807
One hundred, two hundred and fifty

300
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,935
That's it, and I got mine

301
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:52,636
Okay

302
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,770
What'll I tell Clay Williams?

303
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,780
Tell him I'll be back in the Spring,
I'll have the horses for him

304
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:56,781
if he still wants them

305
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:57,782
He still wants 'em all right

306
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:58,942
Tell him I mean to keep my word

307
00:16:58,984 --> 00:16:59,780
All right

308
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,080
Pleasure doin' business with you

309
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,382
Have a safe trip

310
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,787
Take care, Woody

311
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:04,413
Browder

312
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,320
Browder

313
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,514
Slater! Slater!

314
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,924
I come for the horses, Slater

315
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,518
You owe me five dollars!

316
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,790
Pay him

317
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,005
Billy! Billy!

318
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,267
Where are they?

319
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,571
They're around

320
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,838
Billy!

321
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,209
They ain't in here, Slater!

322
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,737
I said they're around!

323
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,041
Woody, check the corral

324
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,816

325
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:23,698
Easy now, easy. Easy now boys

Oh, Christ!

00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,629
It's alright

334
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,870
Easy now

335
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,251
Slater!

336
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,256
Come out here, boy, I wanna talk to you!

337
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,190
Those are not my horses!

338
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,153
What'd you do to my horses?

339
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,726
Oh! Jeez!

340
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:24,922
Huh? What'd you do to my horses?

341
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:25,861
I didn't do nothin'

342
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:26,887
why don't you ask your Crow!

343
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,661
I will when I find him, where is he?

344
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,101
Jesus, I don't know!
He was makin' trouble!

345
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,370
They have sores on them!
Tied to a pig sty!

346
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,738
Cause your Crow took off

347
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,505
I can't take care of 'em by myself

348
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,876
You been workin' in the fields, Slater!

349
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:43,939
What's the trouble here?

350
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,542
Listen,
I shoulda put the dogs on him, boss!

351
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,052
What did you do to my animals?

352
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,214
Now, he's bitchin'
about me workin' his horese too much

353
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,248
He says they ain't his.
Maybe he wants you to buy 'em

354
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,658
I wouldn't sell you a coyotel!

355
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,685
Did you get his five dollars?

356
00:19:58,797 --> 00:19:59,855
Yeah, he's paid up

357
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,627
Then get your horses and git

358
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,259
I can't move 'em cause they can't walk and

359
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,929
I ain't gonna injure them any more!

360
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,801
I left you with well fed and healthy horses

361
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,237
Ballard, and I want 'em back that way

362
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,365
Them is all you gonna get!

363
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,672
These are not my horses!

364
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,344
I don't even recognize them!

365
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,410
You got two weeks to put back into condition!

366
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,544
Two weeks! Two years!

367
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,112
I ain't gonna condition nothin'!

368
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,090
Two weeks, old man!

369
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,950
You got somethin' you wanna say to me?

370
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,053
Yeah, I'm tired of your
statehoodin' mouth in your spittin' image

371
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,257
Ballard, healthy and fat!

372
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,329
Git!

373
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,939
Myrl...

374
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,842
Where's Billy?

375
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,106
He's inside

376
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,306
Where is he?

377
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,645
He's, he's in the kitchen

378
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:01,951
Billy

379
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,690
Myrl, sorry about the horese

380
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,199
What happened?

381
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,966
Slater. Sl-, Slater run me off

382
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,064
Why?

383
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,338
Long as I was there
he couldn't work the blacks to death

384
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,371
I told him they were young
and and they'd never been in harness

385
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:26,874
He, he tied them to a pig sty
in the mud wouldn't take the harness off

386
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,943
After a week they were filthy

387
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:32,548
And one day I came out,
and he had 'em hooked up to a log pull

388
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,458
Come on, now! For Chrissakes!

389
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,688
What the hell is goin' on here?

390
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:37,786
Get over here!

391
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,421
What the hell is goin' on!

392
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:45,294
Then that old Slater
and Ollie they beat me

393
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,268
Then he set them dogs on me

394
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,400
Get him! Get him!

395
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,373
No!

396
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,745
They mighta killed me if
I'da went back there

397
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,909
You did rigth leavin'

398
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,216
Why don't you let Billy eat

399
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,777
I oughta kill him

400
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,083
Boy!

401
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,952
What?

402
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,253
Why don't you let Billy eat

403
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,623
Yeah

404
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,153
Rest easy

405
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:25,975
DAMN IT!

406
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,119
What're ya gonna do?

407
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,389
Get my horses back the way I left them

408
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,690
And damages for Billy

409
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,755
Ballard ain't gonna do
that cause you tell him to,

410
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,790
and pay Billy to boot.
He'd be the laughin' stock of Rawlins

411
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,963
You're settin' yourself up for a fall, Myrl

412
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:59,540
Ballard ain't gonna do
what you want him to he just wont'!

413
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,436
Yes he will!

414
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,776
You got chores to do, boy?

415
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:08,877
Yes, sir

416
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,353
Then get to 'em!

417
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,733
I dunno, Myrl.
Ballard's got a lot of friends

418
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,672
I wanna know what the law says I can do

419
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,540
Well, you could sue him

420
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,244
Then I wanna sue him

421
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:33,972
It's not as simple as that

422
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,104
Why not?

423
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:39,675
Well, you gotta figure on things like
how much it's gonna cost you, can you win?

424
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,312
I don't care what it costs

425
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:47,885
Myrl, you go up against Ballard in
this town you're gonna go through Judge Wilkins

426
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,554
Now Wilkins got shares in
Ballard's cattle association

427
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,621
I want my horses back in the condition
I left them in! And damages for Billy!

428
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,654
Do you wanna handle it?

429
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,668
Jesus, Myrl! You're askin'
Wilkins to rule

430
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,432
for you against Ballard in an
Injun against a white man?

431
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,373
I believe that God
is to man as man is to animal

432
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,069
You treat them with respect

433
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,273
You set dogs on a man, you pay for it

434
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,543
Now the law upholds these ideas

435
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,016
And I mean to see the law has its day

436
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,018
Do you wanna handle it?

437
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,680
I'm tryin' to tell you somethin'
here if you'll listen.

438
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,985
You're wastin' your money!

439
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,257
I'll file if you want me to file.

440
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,729
It'll cost you twenty dollars in advance

441
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,262
Twenty dollars

442
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,766
In advance

443
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,707
Half now, and the rest when
I see what you come up with

444
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,348
Now you file it!

445
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,907
Sure

446
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,225
Two boxes, here we go, Myrl

447
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,261
Good to have you back

448
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:04,796
I think you paid up last time

449
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,996
so we're gonna start fresh

450
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,004
Okay

451
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,665
Mr. Redding!

452
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:13,711
You got two swaybacks stinkin' up
Mr. Ballard's stables

453
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:17,806
I appreciate it if you pick 'em
up real soon, y'hear?

454
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,818
Otherwise, we're liken to...

455
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,413
chop 'em up for slop or somethin'

456
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:26,917
All right, Slater

457
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,358
You wanna take it on back to the room?

458
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,522
Kermit, next time
Ballard or one of his fools comes in,

459
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,794
tell him the law will take care of Ballard.

460
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,599
And if the law don't take are of him,
I'm gonna take care of him

461
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:42,937
One way or the other,
there's gonna be justice I will have it.

462
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,408
Ballard himself is gonna feed
and groom my stallions,

463
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,742
make 'em shiny and beautiful,
just like I left them

464
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:54,810
And no matter what it cost
me that's gonna happen. Sure as sunshine

465
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,151
Will you tell Mr. Ballard that if you see him?

466
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,678
Yeah

467
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,824
Hear me, I speak the truth!

468
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,223
And poker as usual, at my place

469
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,492
Tuesday night

470
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,824
I appreciate the help, Judge

471
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,097
Ah, you're welcome

472
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,540
Oh, Judge! Judge Wilkins

473
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,008
I was just comin' up to see ya!

474
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,136
I don't have time for you today, Rayborn

475
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:21,543
Come around next week

476
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,346
But... but I'm w-, w-,
waitin' on your decision, Judge

477
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,010
It's been a couple of weeks, now

478
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,391
It's been a coupla weeks now, Judge

479
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,621
My client's getting'
awful nervous about this

480
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,221
Sit down, Rayborn, you make me nervous

481
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,697
Yes sir, Judge

482
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,599
Just waitin' for you decision, Judge

483
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:50,932
I uh, I hope the petition
is in proper legal form...

484
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,809
...and where a justice
of your integrity is used to seein'

485
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:56,313
Nothin' special, it was okay

486
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,413
You talked this petition over with
Redding?

487
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:01,150
Yes, sir

488
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,780
Seems like a pissy ant fuss to me

489
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,757
Redding wants to file a suit or
is that your idea?

490
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,723
Oh well, no

491
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,624
I gave him counsel to the contrary, Judge

492
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,889
His mind's made up

493
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,159
Tell him to take his horses home and forget it

494
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:17,601
Well, you see,
my client views them as prize stallions, Judge

495
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,764
Prize is in the mind, counselor

496
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,365
Ballard don't want 'em,

497
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,672
so what's
Redding gonna do, leave 'em there?

498
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,439
Well, it's like the charges says...

499
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,674
I know what the charges say

500
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,079
Yes, sir

501
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,246
Follishness,
prideful follishness is what this is

502
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:36,583
If I was you, I'd talk sense into him

503
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,915
I got five towns to cover,
counselor and you bring me this

504
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:45,487
I don't have time for a hearing
Fifty dollars for Billy Redwood, a Crow?

505
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,497
Jesus

506
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,058
Yeah, well,
I gave him honest realistic counsel on that

507
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,966
You did, uh huh

508
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,937
Uh huh. He wants it filed

509
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:02,712
Uh, just, uh, just wondering
when you want a hearing, that's all

510
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,709
Uh, well, you don't have
to decide right now just when you get a chance

511
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,913
Ain't gonna be one

512
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,949
I'm throwing the case out, lack of evidence

513
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:18,088
I advise you to tell Redding
to pick up his horses and get on with his wife

514
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,153
Yes sir, Judge

515
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,098
And I advise you
to pick your clients more carefully

516
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,328
if you want to do business in this town

517
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,495
Yes, sir

518
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,506
You're haulin' shit up a mountain, Rayborn

519
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,565
Careful it don't spill on you

520
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:33,168
Shit up a mountain. Thank you, sir

521
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,179
Hey, Myrl, word is Ballard's still
workin' them horses out in the field

522
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,414
Where'd you hear that?

523
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,582
Mac Turnage comin' through Casper

524
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:49,081
Says he saw 'em, thought they
were yours maybe not, though

525
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,994
Just take him longer
to put 'em back into shape

526
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,058
Well, there ain't nothin' more
I can do, Myrl

527
00:28:55,967 --> 00:29:00,870
Except, maybe... uh, Billy!

528
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,735
Leave the room, would ya

529
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:02,933
I wanna say somethin' private

530
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,568
Anything you got to say
to me you can say in front of Billy

531
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,705
Well, word I get is
Ballard wants to do business with you

532
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,444
He wants to settle with you
on the horses but he won't pay Billy

533
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,416
Why not?

534
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,918
Well, Billy gave him trouble and run off

535
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,750
Billy didn't run off!

536
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,052
Ballard's fools run him off!

537
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,488
The suit stands the way it's writ

538
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,927
Well, then he won't settle with you

539
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,328
it's gonna be a standoff

540
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:27,922
Not to my mind

541
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,258
Well, what else you gonna do?

542
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,297
Whatever it takes

543
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,231
Cage, you want more stew?

544
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,296
Please

545
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,371
Are we ever gonna get our horses back?

546
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,348
I don't know, Cage

547
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:51,110
Now you sleep tight
you let me worry about it

548
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:01,221
I'm goin' to Cheyenne to see
the Governor before any of this happens

549
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,791
Or whoever runs the law and...

550
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:10,364
if that don't work, I'm thinkin' about it

551
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,841
Doin' it all over again, ain't ya?

552
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,867
Don't ya know me?

553
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,807
You know there's no way
I can let a man do what that man did

554
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,714
That is not possible!

555
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:20,775
I know you

556
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,218
If people are gonna kick me

557
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,721
I'd rather be a dog than a man, Cora

558
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,621
So if justice is to be done

559
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,421
don't deny me the freedom I need to get it!

560
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:32,020
No! This is not just about you
and what you think is right!

561
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,997
I'm a part of you and so is Cage

562
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,829
We just get thrown in, is that it?

563
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,357
Cora, please, keep you voice down

564
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:38,528
Cage is listenin'

565
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,538
I'm not sayin'
you shouldn't go after Ballard

566
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:44,531
but... you're doin'
exactly what he wants you to do...

567
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,874
to scare people away

568
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,374
Let me try somethin', Myrl.

569
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:52,247
My way. Lf, if it don't work, then

570
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:53,648
Then you do what you have to do

571
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,016
I'll stand with you, no matter what

572
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,111
What are you talkin' about, Cora?

573
00:30:56,154 --> 00:31:00,056
You know
I'm better at politicin' than you are

574
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,889
Let me go to Cheyenne for us

575
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:06,693
I know the Attorney General's wife
Judith Metcalf

576
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:10,428
I met her at the Statehood Rally last year in Casp

577
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:14,200
I spent the whole afternoon with her

578
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,530
She'll get the petition to her husband

579
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,337
That'll be the end of it

580
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,209
You get the horses back
the way you want 'em, and somethin' for Billy...

581
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,440
Cora, this is not your fight

582
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,607
IT IS MY FIGHT! It's my family!

583
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,480
Look out that window

584
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,212
If you don't stay here and fix the barn

585
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,051
we're gonna be livin' hand
to mouth before you know it

586
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,723
I've been prayin', for a miracle

587
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,556
So there'd be peace between
Ballard and me

588
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,892
But nothin' comes back. No answer

589
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,864
No ways to go, nothin'!

590
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:45,233
I'm your miracle. I'm what you prayed for

591
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,068
What sort of woman is she
the Attorney General's wife?

592
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,341
She's a fine woman

593
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,245
Her husband?

594
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,749
Mm, I'm sure her husband is fair

595
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,375
I don't know, Cora, what you're askin'...

596
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,510
The truth is...

597
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,417
I got a terrible fear you go off chasin'

598
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:06,184
Ballard, I'll never see you again

599
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,850
You're getting' sassy with your old man

600
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:12,294
is what I'm hearin',
you better watch that

601
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,924
So it's all decided

602
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,430
I'll be back in two weeks

603
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,027
I'll take Woody with me

604
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,265
I'll see the Attorney General

605
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,002
and I'll get the lamp oil you always forget

606
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,507
Two weeks is a long time

607
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:32,107
Mm, nothin' like a little separation
to make the heart grow fonder

608
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:37,611
Also, I'm smarter than you
when it come to politicin'. Di...

609
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,418
Or did I say that?

610
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,790
Yeah, I think you mentioned that one

611
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,164
You're a miracle, all right

612
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,037
Take care of my bride, Woody

613
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,515
You betcha

614
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:20,363
If I meet a handsome cowboy,
I may go right on to Phil-l-del-phi-ay

615
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:21,724
Well, if you do, send Woody back

616
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,324
I need him for the roofing

617
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,766
Wouldn't be jealous, would ya?

618
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,566
No

619
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,333
Better come back, hurry up, lose my man

620
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,435
Get down offa there, son!

621
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,335
Cage, kiss your mother, get off there!

622
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,848
Cage, go on now,
get outta here. Go on, now!

623
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,513
You go work on that barn

624
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,355
See ya, Myrl

625
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,390
Bye boys

626
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,922
Come on, come on

627
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,050
Haul it in before you let go!

628
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:27,553
Push it up again!

629
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,799
Cora, I'm gonna go over to the blacksmiths

630
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,602
All right

631
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,573
I'll come find ya

632
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:38,575
I'll be here

633
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,211
These the original documents in the case?

634
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,973
Excuse me one moment, Mr. Crawford

635
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,986
You're next! Now, okay

636
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,488
I will take these under
consideration for the Attorney General

637
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,286
You are Mr. Wakefield, is that correct?

638
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:55,656
Mr. Wakefield? Okay

639
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,991
You might wanna take a seat,
we'll get to you as soon as we can

640
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,099
Look! Look!

641
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,230
We started to,
we started to go off to the one side

642
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,240
as we were comin' up over the last hill

643
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:14,472
Hey, I think we gotta go visit
an old neightbor of ours

644
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,743
Mr. Metcalf, please

645
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,308
You have an appointment?

646
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,081
No, I don't

647
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,055
All these folks have appointments, ma'am

648
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,113

653
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:34,591
This week is outta the question

654
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,930
He's across town with the statehood people

655
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:41,235
Judith Metcalf said any time
I was in Cheyenne to come look her up

656
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:44,139

Thank you, Captain

667
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,131

668
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:17,971
Yes?

669
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,105
Well, we rode that up

Someone get a doctor!
She's still breathing

674
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,068

675
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,079
Call Doc Patterson

676
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:30,239

677
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,441
She got run over

678
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,006

Okay. Okay. Okay

685
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,633
Crazy bastards out there!

686
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,370
It hurts awful, Woody

687
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:06,111
Oh, I know. I know. I let you down, Cora

688
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,742
I'm so sorry

689
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,946
Don't let me die here

690
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,887
Oh no, you ain't gonna die

691
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:15,881
I won't let you die. We gotta go home

692
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,092
Hang on, and go home

693
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,228
Everything's gonna be okay now

00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,203
Everything's gonna be okay

696
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,405
Uh, this petition doesn't belong here

697
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,376
It's under, send it to Wilkins

698
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,470
Judge Wilkings in Rawlins

699
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:36,480

Yes, sir?

702
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,981

Hey, everybody! Ma's comin'!

Hey, yeah! Look at that, right on time!

705

I swear, your mother clocks
better than Union Pacific, Cage

706
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,228
What happened to my wife?!

707
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,377
Oh... Cora, Cora...

708
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,751
Cora?

709
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,848
What happened?

710
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,277
I'm so sorry I wasn't there for her

711
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:30,726
I'm so sorry. I should never have left her

712
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,258
It's all right

713
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:33,729
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry

714
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,129
You weren't lookin' for trouble

715
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,497
I'm so sorry

716
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,205
Be, be praised my Lord for those

717
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:24,681
who forgive through your love
and bear sickness and tribulation

718
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,946
Blessed are those whoe endure in peace

719
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,546
for they will be crowned by you, Most High

720
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,315
Be praised, my Lord for our sister bodily

721
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,888
death from whom no living thing can escape

722
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:50,367
Blessed are those whom
she finds doing your holy will

723
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:56,470
for the second death cannot harm them

724
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,616
Ante up! Nickel ante

725
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,386
Mr. Ballard, five-card draw

726
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:11,053
Then what happened, Ollie?

727
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,659
Woody started it

728
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,857
He said I smelled like pig slop

729
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:16,690
I stroked him a good one

730
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:19,726
Oh! It woulda pleasured me
to have been there to see that

731
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,759
Yes, sir

732
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,829
Take my advice, you steer clear of Redding

733
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:26,900
Sent his own woman to
Cheyenne to beg for him

734
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:27,876
Yeah, yeah

735
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,379
What kinda man do a thing like that?

736
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,007
Keep buyin' as we been doin'
and next year there'll be nothin'

737
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,017
but pasture form here to Landers

738
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,349
No way they can stop us, even the statehood

739
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,911
Accordin' to you, Mr. Ballard

740
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:40,253
Keep the land rollin' in, that's the ticket

741
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,020
Calm everybody down

742
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,391
That means you, Ollie

743
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:47,158
You and Slater. Good things are happenin'

744
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,721
we don't need trouble

745
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,701
Uh, is that a quarter to me,
or to the Judge?

746
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,599
Your quarter

747
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,069
A quarter to you, Judge

748
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,196
Another one?

749
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:30,806
Shelby!

750
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,370
Hey, bro

751
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,139
How are you?

752
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,841
Shelby, this is your chance

753
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,644
I know you been wantin' to expand

754
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:40,581
You wanna sell out?

755
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,642
Maybe

756
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,983
After all you put into it?

757
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:45,252
Well, yeah

758
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,450
I'm interested, Myrl, I'd be a fool not to

759
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,118
but I gotta, I gotta think about it

760
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,251
You come on me all of a sudden

761
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:50,988
The whole lot

762
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:51,858
You seen this

763
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,021
you know what I'm talkin' about

764
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:53,961
I know it's prime, all right

765
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:54,896
The whole lot

766
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,331
Gimme a hand

767
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,126
All right, Hattie

768
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:04,839
You're serious

769
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,002
I got Rayborn workin' up the papers now

770
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,705
You've been a good neighbor, Shelby

771
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,043
I wanna give you first crack

772
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,980
You're talkin' the whole spread?

773
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:14,382
And what's on it

774
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:19,278
Well, Myrl, I am gonna tell you up front

775
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,285
I don't have a need for all them horses

776
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,519
No, no, the horses ain't part of the deal

777
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,686
I got plans for the horses

778
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,461
So what we're talkin'
is the price of the land

779
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,431
And what's on it

780
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,696
I come up with three dollars an acre

781
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,664
Three dollars an acre?

782
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,639
Tha's a fair price, Myrl

783
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,869
You betcha, that's awful good

784
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:42,504
As long as you understand. Cash on sight

785
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:45,912
Why are you doin' this, Myrl?

786
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,814
I mean, you got water.

787
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,319
You got one of the finest
tracts of land in Rawlins

788
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,187
I mean,
if it's all because of Ballard, hell

789
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,186
I mean that land is your future

790
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,089
There rae bigger things than land

791
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:02,895
I'll haop you out

792
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,025
Want a cup of coffee?

793
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,035
Thanks

794
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:19,310
Myrl

795
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:20,782
Edsel

796
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,814
Hello

797
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:24,676
Hello, Mr. Rayborn

798
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,087
Cage

799
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,590
What did he say?

800
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:35,564
Well, Attorney General
sent you petition back

801
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,768
I mean, he's awful sorry about
Cory and everything,

802
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:41,430
but he had to turn you down

803
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:46,535
He says it's a local matter
and it's up to Judge Wilkins to decide

804
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:51,978
That's the law, see,
and he's gotta obey it

805
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,012
Just like you

806
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,087
What are you tellin' me?

807
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:02,883
Well, uh, Wil-

808
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:07,124
Wilkins already ruled, so... that's it

809
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:16,862
I put in a lot of time on this, Myrl

810
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:18,699
Have you?

811
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,141
Yeah

812
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,707
How much do I owe you?

813
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,306
Twenty-five

814
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,185
Plus what you already owe

815
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,724
Hi, boys

816
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:48,235
That's all I got,
I'll give you that rest later

817
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,773
I won't be needin' you any more

818
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:58,077
I'm awful sorry about what happened to Cora

819
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,515
That's an awful thing to happen

820
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:06,717
Just awful. Whole town's upset about it

821
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:10,449
If there's anything I can do, just...

822
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,929
I wrote somethin' I want you to read

823
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,538
Tell me what you think

824
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:26,140
I, Myrl Redding, by authority in...

825
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,609
born in me as a free man...

826
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:29,737
A free man living in a free territory

827
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,247
...demand that Henry Ballard

828
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:34,444
within seven days of receiving this not...

829
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,851
...bring to my stables
the horses he took from me,

830
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:42,154
groom and fatten them with
your own hands to the condition I left them!

831
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,786
And to injuries caused to
Billy Redwood who did nothing to you,

832
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:47,194
pay him fifty dollars!

833
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:50,997
It is signed
Myrl Redding owner of the horses!

834
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,266
Let the law take care of it, Myrl

835
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:56,431
There's no way Ballard's gonna do what
you tell him to do just because you say so

836
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,873
Yes he will. And if he don't

837
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,308
I got plans to convince him

838
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,676
Anyone want to hear
the particulars come to spread at sundown

839
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,340
and I'll spell it out for you

840
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:08,317
I hold no man responsible for
the death of my wife but me.

841
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,486
I let her go

842
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:14,317
And I gotta live with that
the rest of my wife

843
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,321
Judge Wilkins!

844
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,189
In a town where there's no law,
a man is obliged to make his own

845
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,925
Isn't that the way it works around here?

846
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,592
Wouldn't you say, Judge Wilkins?

847
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,625
Seven days

848
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:04,265
Henry Ballard! Come talk to me!

849
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:08,267
I'm delivering a notice of law on you!

850
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:15,246
You got sever days to read it, and answer it

851
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:30,794
Seven days, and I'm comin' for ya

852
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,805
I shoulda killed him

853
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:49,944
Now, Shelby'll deposit the rest of
the money in your name in the bank in Casper

854
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,114
If I need any, I'll come to you

855
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,316
But remember, it's your money

856
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,349
Why can't I just go with you?

857
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:59,920
Well, I need you to stay here with
Mr. And Mrs. Dykes do I don't worry

858
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:01,787
All I want is to go with you, Dad

859
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,131
It's yourjob now to hold down
the fort 'till I get back.

860
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,568
I mean somebody's gotta
take care of the spread

861
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:11,438
Now that's a big responsibility,
do you understand?

862
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,406
Sure

863
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:15,536
Cage, do you understand?

864
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:16,944
Well, but, but all I want is to help you

865
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,882
I know. I know

866
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:29,615
Hell, we all know it!
Ballard's gone too far

867
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:30,557
Yes, he has

868
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:31,618
Puttin' up a toll gate

869
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:32,821
Decidin' who's to pay, and who ain't

870
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,353
If he can get away
with what he done to Myrl

871
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,059
then he can do whatever the hell he wants

872
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,067
It's time we all woke up!

873
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:39,432
I know you're all real busy

874
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,232
so I'll get right to the point

875
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,899
I'm invitin' you to ride
with me against Henry Ballard

876
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:52,671
No. Wh-, what Ballard did to
Billy and your horses sure was bad.

877
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,150
Now I'd like to help,
but this ain't my quarrel

878
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,619
You're right, Dewey, it ain't your quarrel

879
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:00,885
But there'll come a time
and this toll gate is just a start of things

880
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:05,156
when Ballard decides to box you
in some more, maybe take some of your land

881
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,959
or cut you off from water
like he did Cary Sartman

882
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,295
Then you'll come and say

883
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:11,766
Looky here, Myrl, look what Ballard's doin'

884
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:12,996
I need you support.

885
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,196
And I could say to you

886
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,068
Dewey, it ain't my quarrel

887
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:19,303
I run a horse farm. I live over there

888
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,333
Two hour ride

889
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:24,876
But until statehood comes along
all we got is Ballard's law!

890
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,281
That's right!

891
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:29,148
And there's no future in it!

892
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:32,349
And I did not come fifteen
hundred miles to tolerate that!

893
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,050
I ain't lookin' for a shootout!

894
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,217
Well, neither is Myrl!

895
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,190
That's right!

896
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:38,786
Overpower him with numbers that's the idea
scare him into doin' right

897
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,626
Folks like you and me comin' after him

898
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:41,528
No bloodshed

899
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:42,623
What if he runs?

900
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,759
Let him. We'll follow till we find him

901
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:45,665
Damn right

902
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:46,634
How long will it take, Myrl?

903
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,331
Maybe a day, maybe two, maybe longer

904
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:49,998
I don't care, I'll provide
the horses and grub as long as it takes!

905
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,871
It takes money, Myrl

906
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,136
My spread's for sale

907
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,609
Shelby and I worked out a deal

908
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:57,408
Every man Jack of ya gets
fifteen dollars a month

909
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,108
for as long as it takes to bring that

910
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,310
man in alive and workin' in these stables!

911
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,842
Myrl means business!

912
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:06,617
I'm for it! I'm sick of Ballard beatin' us!

913
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,123
I know men who'd ride against him

914
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:09,318
Bring them along.

915
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,849
Now if you don't wanna go, it's okay with me

916
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,055
I'm goin' after Ballard anyway

917
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:16,127
And if you don't wanna go
on principle then go for money,

918
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,293
cause I pay cash on the barrel head!

919
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:19,996
Fifteen dollars!

920
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:42,515
He ain't comin'! Who's he gonna come with?

921
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,996
Well, he's got Woody, and an Injun

922
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,895
He shows, he goes home in a pine box

923
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,445
Hey! Hold up there!

924
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,706
Mr. Ballard! It's Redding

925
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,271
and he's got a whole army with him!

926
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,646
He's got a hundred men with him

927
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,480
Mr. Ballard, get outta here! Go!

928
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:20,546
Get 'em up in the bunkhouse tell
them to et their guns on! Hurry up!

929
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:47,580
Go on! Get the hell outta my way! Git! Git!

930
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:56,985
Hey, get back here! Get back here!

931
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:59,552
Get back here you sons of bitches,
where you goin'?
