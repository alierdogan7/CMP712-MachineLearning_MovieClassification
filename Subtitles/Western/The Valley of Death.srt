1
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,680
Down with the gun, fool.

2
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,200
Where is the gold, Kingsley?
Since you never come back.

3
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,840
Plug it.
Where is it gold, Major?

4
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,120
I skin you alive if you do not talk.

5
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,800
Fucking asshole.
Wait.

6
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,920
Winnetou.

7
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,160
Had it in the Ozark Indians
waiting for me.

8
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:21,880
Is the letter ... he is ...
I went to my village.

9
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,240
Flying Arrow has all the paper
to put Winslow.

10
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,000
There is at
where the gold is hidden.

11
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,120
You have to keep secret.
I do so until they called me.

12
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,560
Now we have all the evidence,
is no doubt ...

13
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,800
Major Kingsley that the gold
the army has been stolen.

14
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,640
The gold transport
that he led ...

15
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,320
Fort Dawson has left
but it never arrived.

16
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,760
Can I 'word?
The defense has' t speak.

17
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,920
To whom are you doing here, gentlemen?
To Major Kingsley.

18
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,840
For the honor of a brave
and good soldier ...

19
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,240
that the gold from Fort Dawson
would have been stolen.

20
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,760
What happened? The fort
had to be evacuated ...

21
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,280
and it had gold in safety
be charged.

22
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,240
Major Kingsley left the escort
then without the "t gold leave.

23
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,520
That was the right decision ...

24
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,120
because that is underway escort
robbed and slain.

25
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,840
Dan 's been away gold.
He acted as officer correct:

26
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,120
he had the gold
Three male escort.

27
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,360
He wanted only three man
gold transport through a field ...

28
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,800
that is full of rebels,
crooks and Indians?

29
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,400
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
That he has done intentionally.

30
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,480
Yes, I have that impression.
And where is the gold now?

31
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,480
Major knew that the leather,
know that he was duty faithfully.

32
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,080
Where it is gold, we do not know.
I will tell you that.

33
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,080
In Mexico.
Like the 'good' Major.

34
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,960
This charge ring
I ask 's court ...

35
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,280
to a suspension to Kinsley's
daughter, Mabel, is present.

36
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,520
Miss Kingsley is underway with
The last letter from her father.

37
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,600
That letter calls the Major Friday
and indicate where it is gold.

38
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,120
I protest.

39
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:45,960
That letter is a deliberate
astray. I think ...

40
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,320
I withdraw
the prosecutor 's word.

41
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
The request
is granted.

42
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,040
The session is delayed
Miss Kingsley to present.

43
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,400
If the river is dry cases,
we gain an hour ...

44
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,400
as we go forward.
I know this region.

45
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,880
I come here often for business.

46
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,320
Here is some more to get
and business is business.

47
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,240
A Roman once said:
Pecunia non Olette.

48
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,760
That means money is trump.
Or something.

49
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,320
It means: Money stinM not.
Smart. Funny. Money stinM not.

50
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,680
Smart guys who Romans.
You want what?

51
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,680
How you called again?
It was not Mabel Kingsley?

52
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,560
Yes, but things I have
no sense.

53
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,120
That is something for men,
not for beautiful girls.

54
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,040
Wait for my sign.

55
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,320
Halt. Hands up.
Of that car and fast.

56
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,960
From the car off, I said.

57
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,960
Get out.
Hurry.

58
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,880
Enter the letter.
What letter?

59
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,240
The letter stating
where the gold is.

60
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,320
Love her.
Halt. No movement.

61
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,200
Weapons road and hands up.
Old Shatterhand.

62
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,680
Go in a row.

63
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:48,200
Help, help.

64
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,040
You disarms the men now.

65
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,280
Me? No, you know.
I am a peaceful citizen.

66
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,200
And a coward.
Or something.

67
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,160
That bastard.

68
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,080
That put me on the spot about.
Do not.

69
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,000
I got a different idea.
We get them later Friday ...

70
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,240
and Old Shatterhand
We help.

71
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,000
What are you doing?
But let 's op.

72
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,520
Help.

73
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,120
Easy, easy.

74
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,560
The boss.
The boss is coming.

75
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,480
What was wrong?
We had almost the letter ...

76
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,480
but threw Old Shatterhand
soot in 't eat.

77
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,520
Suckers. Where are the horses?
That he chased away.

78
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,000
Catch them. Craig and I go
back to Old Shatterhand.

79
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,440
I get it.
Father's last letter.

80
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,160
He is posted in Winslow.
I know of no Indian.

81
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,000
In Philadelphia
nobody could translate.

82
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,440
It is Apache.
I understand.

83
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,880
What's wrong?

84
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,440
What do these words?

85
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,680
I tell that later. Now you can
better still do not know.

86
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,800
First, you have witnesses
for the court.

87
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,560
Can I give you some good advice?

88
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,680
You vertroum me anyway?
If no other.

89
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,200
There they are.

90
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,080
That is the coach.

91
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,960
There is only one driver on.

92
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,640
What happened?
You are too late.

93
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,880
It was horrible.
We were robbed.

94
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,960
But I have the attack
declined.

95
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,000
This city and this environment
are known as very quiet.

96
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,520
See for yourself.

97
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:00,440
Empty cells. There are no
shootings or robberies.

98
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,000
Would you Miss Kingsley
protect ...

99
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,880
and arrange a hotel room?
Of course.

100
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,880
Come on.

101
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,800
Nobody knows
where my father is ...

102
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,080
and yet he may soon dishonor
have resigned. Why?

103
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,880
Why the hurry?

104
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,960
Is enough for a defamation
Public dishonor to dismiss?

105
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,720
Miss Kingsley ...
Let me finish you.

106
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,440
My father raised me
according to the principle ...

107
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,400
that honesty is worth more
than money or property.

108
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,520
He let 's escort act
as astray for the crooks.

109
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,200
And now he is correct
accused of theft.

110
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,600
He 's solid gold rescued
when his men were already dead.

111
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,200
Dead heroes, HC?

112
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,040
What you insinuating?
Their graves are known.

113
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,480
Is Kingsley than guilty
because his grave is not known?

114
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,560
If he is buried somewhere.
He may also still be alive.

115
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,760
But where is the letter
that your father must be free advocate?

116
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:08,480
Let me see him.
The letter is here.

117
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,080
Give him.
No.

118
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,600
Wantroum the court?
No, I distrust you.

119
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,480
That is unheard of.
Your Honor, I object.

120
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,920
If the prosecutor again
go to his place?

121
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,760
Miss Kingsley, I warn you

122
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:30,680
Because 't court finds that your father
bravely defends ...

123
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,280
explains it to you now no punishment.

124
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,400
But now I ask you ..

125
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:38,640
allow the court access
in this letter?

126
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,760
No.
See?

127
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:46,360
The postmaster said in Winslow
that an Apache brought the letter.

128
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,640
The area of the Apache
lies on the border with Mexico ...

129
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,000
where your father with "t gold.
No.

130
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,440
No? Let see that letter.
I know why they did not want.

131
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,240
This letter calls your father is not free,
but charged him.

132
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,840
Nonsense.
Let see that letter.

133
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,520
If the prosecutor
go to his place?

134
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,640
Silence.

135
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,080
Miss Kingsley, the content
of the letter to comply ...

136
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,320
if they denM that is detrimental
for her father. Is it so?

137
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,840
No, Your Honor. But the letter
calls himself my father is not free.

138
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,240
Therefore, I more
Evidence come ...

139
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,080
as it courted me 60 days
postponement would be willing to give.

140
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,040
Would you 't find gold itself?

141
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,960
I beg to those 60 days for you
adjudicates on my father's honor.

142
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,680
After those 60 days you are in Mexico
in the arms of your father.

143
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,600
No, I have the time necessary
to be here to collect evidence.

144
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,120
I am to inspect the letter.

145
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,640
The court will consider your request
grant ...

146
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,240
If you have a witness who has
your hopes on new evidence supports.

147
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,360
I am the witness.

148
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,680
May I ask who you are?

149
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,560
I become Old Shatterhand
said.

150
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,680
You did far too conspicuous.
They wanted that letter does not give.

151
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,520
Loser.
Kingsley did not gold.

152
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,640
He is dead and
Winnetou has buried him.

153
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,600
First he hid the gold
and in the letter is true.

154
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,600
That girl is cunning.

155
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,640
Where did they 60 days
necessary?

156
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,760
In order to steal the gold itself.

157
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,760
What are you doing?
Miss Kingsley has room 6.

158
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:42,880
No violence.
Not now and not here.

159
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,320
Relax, I only get that letter.
Tell that Davis' s time.

160
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,840
Murdock,
do not precipitate things.

161
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,200
Get out.

162
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,240
Ram but on those keys.
Even harder.

163
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,200
My mother always said:
Only hard music is good.

164
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,080
Otherwise you have nothing.

165
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,320
Who's there?
A harbinger of the court.

166
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,120
What is it?
I got it rechtbanmerslag.

167
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,200
That you must still sign.

168
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,320
Where is the letter?

169
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,640
No sound and no wrong
move or I shoot.

170
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,760
I assume you the letter hum.

171
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,120
Am I right?

172
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,200
I got that letter.
Then I would like to see him.

173
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,280
Do you recognize him?

174
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,760
Put him down.

175
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,200
You get him.

176
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,400
We heard gunfire.
Is anyone hurt?

177
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,160
I wanted to chat, but my size
wanted something else.

178
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,680
Would you get the sheriff?
Immediately.

179
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,280
Now I know why I
The letter had to give. BedanM.

180
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,200
Miss Kingsley, we go.
You must now tackle.

181
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,560
I let the sheriff
a horse for you.

182
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,080
When we drive, we
morning in Colorado.

183
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,240
What does this guy out.

184
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,760
Where did they let you
escape?

185
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,600
What an ignorance.

186
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,920
Are you sometimes a plant?
Yes, these are plants.

187
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,960
I am very grateful.

188
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,040
Said Mr. Shatterhand
that the trip was to Rio Pecos.

189
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,440
No, to Colorado.
Oh yes, the Colorado.

190
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,680
No soldiers escort necessary?
No, we save us.

191
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,120
I am botanist, honey.
I collect rare plants.

192
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,080
What?
Well, this is beautiful.

193
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,800
My name is Rose. I am also known
Prairie Flower said.

194
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,280
I am also rare.
Search still not longer.

195
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,360
Gather me anyway.

196
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,000
I wait here for a friend.

197
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,360
A certain Sam Hawkens.
I can not now.

198
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,280
I have to go to the Wild West.

199
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,960
I want 'n onontdeMe plant
found ...

200
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:28,840
that my name will get:
herba castlepoolensis gigantis.

201
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,840
Hey, where is the whism?

202
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,920
I raise my bet.
You lose that card.

203
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,160
Excuse me, did you perhaps
Sam Hawkens seen one?

204
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,400
That is there.

205
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:54,600
Again, your turn.
I go.

206
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:58,240
Milord?

207
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,480
You now what those differences.
If I am not mistaken.

208
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,280
Sam.
Milord.

209
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,960
Come to my chest.
There you are again, milord.

210
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,120
What you see out.
Again, your dress again.

211
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,880
That continues here.
First pay.

212
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:24,560
Where is your shirt?
Wasted. Unfortunately.

213
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,200
Your shirt and your jacket too?
Unfortunately.

214
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,600
Your hair too?
Unfortunately.

215
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,480
For those hairs, I would like 72 dollars.

216
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:39,400
But then I pay.
Unfortunately.

217
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:52,720
Let us agree on.

218
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:02,000
Sheriff, give me a glass of water.
I am far from the headache.

219
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,280
Forget it.
I do it.

220
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,680
BedanM. Come, then I grab your colt.
Not with those soldiers there.

221
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,600
Tomorrow's redemption
I bring back water.

222
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,800
Oh, I feel better already.
Tomorrow 's too late.

223
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,600
I want now.
They go to Colorado.

224
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,840
Now I can tell you what the
words from the letter mean.

225
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,720
The chief
knows the road to gold.

226
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,520
That chief
I met later.

227
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,240
Winnetou?
Yes, my blood brother.

228
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,360
He will show us the way.

229
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,720
My father had often
about him.

230
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,320
He wrote that he was proud
Winnetou as a friend.

231
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,280
When we meet him?

232
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,600
Quick, dive behind the horses.

233
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,080
Halt.
Dismount.

234
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,400
For me?
Yes.

235
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,360
You were still at the session?

236
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,440
Yes, we are here
on behalf of the war.

237
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:40,920
To protect?
What does that mean?

238
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,640
And as witnesses.
You guys are guards.

239
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:49,240
Afraid that we go to Mexico?
You did it against an officer.

240
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,320
We do not need babysitting.
Shatterhand and I ...

241
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,960
Hold on.

242
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:58,160
At night you see no trace.
How did you find us?

243
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,120
A soldier heard
Miss Kingsley said ...

244
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,480
you guys to Colorado
go.

245
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,800
I got a misstep.

246
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,720
According to the sheriff told you
that we went to Rio Pecos ...

247
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,600
I never with the sheriff
discussed. This is a trap.

248
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,080
The crooks are again
behind us.

249
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:25,920
Here you have your share, mate.
Quick, on horseback.

250
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,840
We need Old Shatterhand
to win.

251
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,360
What are you planning?

252
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:02,080
In the water they hit the track
knrijt. Hopefully they keep that up.

253
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,600
If they follow us, is
a strategic ambush the ...

254
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:08,400
Strategy tells me nothing.

255
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,880
But I do know that
Winnetou us responds.

256
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,160
Where is my herba
castlepoolensis gigantis?

257
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,520
But the crooks are now
back to Shatterhand.

258
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,160
You can not track search?
Well, I did.

259
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:29,720
Here they set
because they were knrijt t track.

260
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,280
They were returned
and it went along.

261
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,560
And if you're wrong?
I rarely mistaken me.

262
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Come on.
Terrible, all these adventures.

263
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,320
Lieutenant, I got a strategic
task for you.

264
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,400
You shall ensure that
Mabel no flight to Mexico.

265
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:02,800
I go to our pursuers
Iastig make.

266
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,680
Wait, I want to know whether your plan
it is strategically justified.

267
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,320
That is nothing to you.

268
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,800
Do what he said
and watch me. Forward.

269
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,000
Miss Mabel.

270
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,680
Pay attention to me.
What do you want?

271
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,560
Militarily ...

272
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,760
this is a diversionary tactic,
Iuitenant.

273
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,160
Failure to do so, that is dangerous.
You are not afraid?

274
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:32,360
Please come down.

275
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,880
Hello, gentlemen.

276
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,840
Where are you going?
Halt.

277
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,080
Here I am.
This way.

278
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,160
Brown, you can track search.

279
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,280
Follow four-man Shatterhands
trace.

280
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,560
Do not shoot.
I want him alive.

281
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,120
Four men with me.
This way.

282
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,320
Faster, faster.

283
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,120
Along here.

284
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:28,400
This way, gentlemen.

285
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,880
Here is Shatterhand
Iangsgekomen.

286
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,120
The rest downwards.

287
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,240
These are their tracks.
We need that way.

288
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,520
Get out.
Bees.

289
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,400
Back, back.
That monster, too.

290
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,800
Look at that.

291
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,800
Here, this is the track.

292
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,640
Halt.
Search coverage.

293
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,800
This is Winnetou,
the chief of the Apache.

294
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,440
What do you know about my father?
He died in my arms.

295
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,960
There is Brown.

296
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,600
Where were you?
We have searched everywhere.

297
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:10,720
What you see out.
What happened?

298
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,440
What happened?
First, what to drink.

299
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:17,520
Where is the rest?
Death.

300
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,440
The rest is dead.
We are surprised by Winnetou.

301
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:27,680
Put their guns against our
Just off the weapons.

302
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,080
I know more about where you
gold to find out.

303
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,640
Where to go?

304
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,520
In the fishing grounds of the Ozark
Indians is the solution.

305
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,200
I have to see themselves
report so that I might reveal.

306
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,760
Do you know where my father
buried?

307
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,680
I, the daughter of my friend
bring to his grave.

308
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,120
If she is in Winnetou,
I know where they go.

309
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,760
Only knows Winnetou
where Major Kingsley's grave is.

310
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,160
To prove that Kingsley
dead, they now go to his grave.

311
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:06,640
That would be best 's possible.
But en route ...

312
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,760
we Ozark against Indians.
Winnetou that will help.

313
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,920
We must strike
for they are in the Ozark.

314
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,000
A frontal attack
is too dangerous.

315
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,920
We must therefore
in a decoy.

316
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,680
Everybody on horseback and forward.
Forward.

317
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,000
Hey, who are you?

318
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,640
Sam. Milord.
Also bees come?

319
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,160
We're good. I saw them.
They run 800 meters for us.

320
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,480
Forward.
Forward.

321
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,240
There they are.

322
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,280
We address them.
Stay in coverage and follow me.

323
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:34,400
I got a job that I go to military
measures must fulfill.

324
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,960
My father saw as a soldier
more human standards.

325
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,320
I know who their gang leader.

326
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,280
That man also knows where
Major Kingsley is buried ...

327
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,000
and he will try us
to catch up.

328
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,280
Does it still hurt?
Only when I laugh.

329
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,880
Laugh or not.
But if I see you, then ... au.

330
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,360
They now ride for us.

331
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:01,720
Dodge them.
That is militarily 's best.

332
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,160
On the prairie, they can us
not entrap.

333
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,880
But ...
That can only be in 't good area.

334
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,480
If it happens,
I know what I have to do.

335
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,520
Did you whism with you?
No. Tools and nails.

336
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,200
Search by cart.

337
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,320
Stop. No.

338
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,560
He has bad luck
if he does not drink it.

339
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,120
Wait.

340
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:39,760
I got an idea.

341
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,240
Help, help.

342
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,960
Someone calls for help.

343
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,720
Come, eropaf.
No, you stay here.

344
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:55,600
Help.

345
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:08,640
Help me anyway.

346
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,600
Help.

347
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,720
Help.
Help me anyway.

348
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,280
I'm dying.

349
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,880
What is my white brother?

350
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:32,120
That cart can never be turned over
on such flat land.

351
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,280
The wheels are very
and the horses are loose.

352
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,240
So a trap?
You bet.

353
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,880
But those poor deserve help.
We need him to help.

354
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:44,000
That I will do now.
Stop.

355
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,720
You walk into a trap.
That man needs help.

356
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,960
It 's ambush.
You are the nail and cowardly.

357
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,680
You will not go there.
Sam, you look at them.

358
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,080
If a hawk.
If I am not mistaken.

359
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,960
I do not recommend
of a citizen.

360
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,760
You do not wind up.

361
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,680
Winnetou and I
they stalk.

362
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,280
Help.

363
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,440
Help.
I can no longer listen.

364
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,400
He will die if we him
t help.

365
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:31,280
That wait is terrible.
Where are these two heroes?

366
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,200
They let him
very humane death.

367
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,120
I am sure what to do.
Even though the 'n trap.

368
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,320
Halt, halt.
No.

369
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,240
Touch officer who is not.
I want him alive.

370
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:58,560
Freeze or he will die.
So anyway.

371
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:06,960
Listen, we have a hostage.
So be wise.

372
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,560
We take him under hands
to give you the letter.

373
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,160
Drop by watching.

374
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,360
Do not come too close,
otherwise your soldier is coming.

375
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,480
And if they do not come?
Oh, come they did.

376
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:31,560
They are still good,
noble people.

377
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,840
Come up.

378
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,080
They're coming.

379
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:27,640
And?
They wait for us.

380
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,840
What do they do with him?
They will torture him.

381
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,480
Until we give the letter.
My god, give that letter then.

382
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:39,680
As long as they have Cummings,
they can blackmail us.

383
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,960
And after they kill us.

384
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:46,480
The lieutenant must come.
And I know only one way.

385
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:51,080
I get it. If the moon two
fingers over the mountains is ...

386
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,760
are you back from the Sioux.
Yes.

387
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,120
Watch out for 's Deputy
chief. He hates whites.

388
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,160
I know.

389
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,880
What is he up to?
Black Panther he ever rescued.

390
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:11,800
They are now friends. He gives
it 's set to warriors.

391
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,200
Then we try
to free the hostage.

392
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,880
I'm afraid.
For him they do nothing.

393
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:22,600
My brother will be back.
He's quick.

394
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,680
Hey, there is no audience?

395
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,240
You miss the show.
Starting something.

396
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,200
Check with a couple man
where they remain.

397
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,880
You go with me four.

398
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:22,080
I'm a little fun with your plan,
so I would only talk.

399
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,960
Where is the gold?
We do not know.

400
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,480
Do you think that I faith?

401
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:32,920
Hey boss, there is nobody
to confess.

402
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,520
What are you doing here, was found face?
I wish Panter Black speak.

403
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:06,080
Why?

404
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:09,560
My friends at the river
the Ticano are in distress.

405
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:12,440
They are threatened
by white bandits.

406
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:18,240
Black Panther is dead. Red
Buffalo is now 't Sioux tribal chief.

407
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,000
All whites are bandits.

408
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:37,000
Therefore, the Sioux
The disagreements have been excavated.

409
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,400
They're coming.
They're coming.

410
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,560
Did you hear that?
They're coming.

411
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:10,000
So we can begin.

412
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,200
Give the letter.
We only want t gold.

413
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:32,360
My sister white
must now be brave.

414
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:36,040
My brother is so white
with the warriors.

415
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,040
Give that letter here.

416
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:45,000
Well, as you want.

417
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:01,760
I take it that letter.
Only when I hear clop.

418
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,600
Then you can bring the letter.
Slowly and halfway.

419
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,600
You tie him down and walk back.
If they afrennen to the letter ...

420
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,280
is the only hostage.

421
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,200
Then they overwhelm the Sioux
and we save the lieutenant.

422
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,320
He was unconscious.

423
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,480
Get 's water.

424
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,360
How long have you wait?

425
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:32,560
If you do not bring that letter,
I save him dead.

426
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,880
Terrible. I must go now.
Let me go.

427
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:47,920
That red devil
Iaat her go.

428
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,520
I have a better idea.
Cut him loose.

429
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:53,880
Get four horses.
Come quickly.

430
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,800
Let the horses draw.

431
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,080
Is there something?
Here with that letter or ...

432
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:45,640
I count to three ...

433
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,840
One.

434
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,520
Two.

435
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:56,480
There they are finally.

436
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,040
Here is the letter.
I bring you the letter.

437
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:01,960
Why not?

438
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,080
Very slowly.
Not too fast.

439
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,520
Let him down.

440
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:19,920
Cut the cord.
Come on, do what she says.

441
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,600
Tahesan? What does that mean?
Takesan mi umann

442
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,720
That is for Apache
'the chief know. "

443
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,680
The chief?
That is down Winnetou.

444
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:54,680
Grab him.

445
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,480
lndianen. Sioux.
Back to the horses.

446
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:05,800
I do not see my white brother.

447
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,680
The Sioux as enemies
come.

448
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,760
Finally, there they are.

449
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,840
Gentlemen, what is this?
We are still friends?

450
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,600
Winnetou does not want to slaughter.
I have to give me the Sioux.

451
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:27,600
All whites will die
to the torture pole.

452
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,680
Also Winnetou:
the friend of the whites.

453
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:03,200
If their wounds are healed,
they die on the torture pole.

454
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,960
Then they
prove their manhood.

455
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:11,480
Also Winnetou. The traitor.
Who me a traitor is called a coward.

456
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:15,720
He has Winnetou not fair
fought.

457
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,560
He simulation of friendship
of the Sioux.

458
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:21,360
There is
no more friendship.

459
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,200
BedanM.

460
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:57,280
It's all my fault.
That you should not say.

461
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,000
But if I had listened ...
I will tell you what.

462
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,360
My father would be the same
have done.

463
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:07,880
BedanM.
That is quite a consolation.

464
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,960
Cozy, you know.

465
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:27,880
The chief of the Sioux
should listen to me.

466
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:31,040
You've Red Buffalo
nothing to say.

467
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,800
lntegendeel.
I know where much gold is ...

468
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,240
to rifles, gunpowder and lead
to buy.

469
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,200
Or guns.
And all the warriors that you want.

470
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:49,320
A war costs money and I know
where the cash is from Fort Dawson.

471
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,600
Gold, pure gold.
A whole car full of gold.

472
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,840
You half
and I the other.

473
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,120
Mermen you anything?
Yes.

474
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,600
What a misery.
That is it.

475
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,520
Here he is.
Nobody knows this plant.

476
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:15,520
Such a beauty
my name can get.

477
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:17,200
He has already 's name.

478
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,960
What then?
Botanical donkey.

479
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,200
I know what you're planning.
It is the only way.

480
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,280
If the time is right,
I will be ready.

481
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,000
This showed facial said ...
I know what he said.

482
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:20,080
I also know that Red Buffalo
weapons' t want to buy gold.

483
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:23,120
But a war is devastating
for our tribes.

484
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,800
Red Buffalo know that I did not even
to the torture pole will speak.

485
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:34,120
So let your maiden torture:
to let me speak.

486
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:39,440
That is a worthy warrior.
Acting as a man in a skirt.

487
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,080
A coward
who dares not to fight.

488
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:44,080
I ashamed for the Sioux.

489
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:47,600
Their chief dares
or a girl to torture ...

490
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,480
but he dares not with me
for the gold to fight.

491
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:53,800
Do not listen to him.

492
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:03,800
I take the challenge.
I will kill you in a duel.

493
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,200
Even my white brother
know where it is gold.

494
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,400
He will lead Red Buffalo
if I die.

495
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,520
What is Red Buffalo
there opposite?

496
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:17,200
Then I leave you free,
except Old Shatterhand.

497
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:21,280
Then you get your horses
and you disappear for good.

498
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,360
So they do not follow behind you?
I will keep my warriors here.

499
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:40,400
Why not throw that coward?

500
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:43,960
Red Buffalo is overcome.
But Winnetou let him live.

501
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,120
The fishing grounds of the Ozark
are nearby.

502
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,560
But the crooks follow us.

503
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:32,960
The safe way is obstructed.
We need to Slangendal it.

504
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,800
Snakes?
Yes.

505
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,120
Many have already died
by their poisonous bite.

506
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,520
But do not worry,
flowers friend.

507
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:22,640
This is the Slangendal.

508
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:27,320
Only if we reach
the fishing grounds of the Ozark.

509
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,440
We have to drive slowly.

510
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,720
The road is rocky and narrow.

511
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:46,000
O, a fellow botanist.
Wonde_ul, or rather, great.

512
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:48,360
In the Slangendal loert death.

513
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:53,120
If your legs and your horses
this plant salve ...

514
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,160
keep the odor away the snakes.
Great.

515
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,440
What is that plant?

516
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:02,680
Herba slangensis enorma
stinkensis, if I am not mistaken.

517
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:08,200
The crooks know who planted not.
That costs them men and horses.

518
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,200
That does not look nice.
Would it be a trap?

519
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,200
We drive around it
and cutting them off.

520
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,240
That does not save the horses.
You're right. Follow them.

521
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,480
Look good.
It is full of snakes here.

522
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,240
Get out.
Back.

523
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:11,880
Get out.

524
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:03,880
Winnetou.

525
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:05,720
Winnetou?

526
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:17,880
And now?

527
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:22,080
Two men have no horse.
So we never get more.

528
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:27,800
We are close to the Ozark.
They have enough horses.

529
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,240
And three solid for us.

530
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,280
Come on, we drive away.
Well.

531
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:35,560
These are our fishing grounds. You
be expected in our camp.

532
01:06:35,719 --> 01:06:40,000
Winnetou bedanM White Feather
for his hospitality.

533
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:43,160
We make two zonsomlopen
use of.

534
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:47,760
Our injured friend
must recuperate.

535
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:54,200
These two whites are here
searching for rare plants.

536
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,120
Will you protect them?

537
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:03,520
Your white friends are welcome
in the Ozark long as they want.

538
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:06,880
This is the daughter of 't injured
paleface ...

539
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:10,000
that many months ago
in the Ozark knram.

540
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:14,280
I am here to promise
being issued.

541
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,680
White Feather know Winnetou.
There is' n canoe ready.

542
01:08:39,159 --> 01:08:41,240
Winnetou the suspected al

543
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:44,320
The gold is
in the Valley of Death.

544
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:48,320
Winnetou know the way. Therefore
he will destroy the card.

545
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:51,640
My brother did not want to know
where it was gold.

546
01:08:53,079 --> 01:08:55,560
Thus, it is exactly.

547
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,520
Gold often pay people
in the destruction.

548
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,400
But go to
the honor of your brave father.

549
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,520
He was Winnetou's friend.
BedanM.

550
01:09:25,159 --> 01:09:29,240
Lieutenant, White Feather
gives us five warriors them.

551
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:33,320
If you want to stay here ...
No, I must do my duty.

552
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:35,320
Oh, it is your duty?

553
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:41,160
I just want to say that
I like to go. Really.

554
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:43,360
Today we drive further.

555
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:20,080
Wait, I get you later.
Delicious slender creature. Wait.

556
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:26,520
Say, bunny ...

557
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,840
when did you once loved
Sammetje for you?

558
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,320
Tonight.
Oh, tonight. Or never.

559
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:44,000
An echo.

560
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:34,160
Have you cross ...
Yes, me.

561
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:36,200
BedanM.

562
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:38,760
Major Kingsley
is honorable cases.

563
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,440
Would you still see the gold?
No. We know where it is.

564
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,520
My men get it on.

565
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,080
I would now like to be alone.

566
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,480
Hey, hello.

567
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,560
That's Sam.

568
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,800
No, bandits.

569
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:27,440
Halt.
None step closer.

570
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,840
I have another verassinkje
for you.

571
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,920
Hopefully you are now slim ...

572
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,920
or else
I should shoot them.

573
01:12:51,319 --> 01:12:53,480
Throw away your weapons.

574
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,640
Is there something?
Road weapons.

575
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:06,200
Kingsley's daughter is enough.
NaaMe monkeys who let us here.

576
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:08,960
As we count them later.

577
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,920
Row for us
and lead us to 't gold.

578
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,440
That is the Valley of Death.

579
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,400
Red Buffalo
is his promise not after.

580
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,760
He will chase us
with Sioux fighters.

581
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,600
Here are chiefs
buried in 's time ...

582
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,040
that no whites
in our country.

583
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:35,400
The broad here to sulfur.
And petroleum.

584
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,480
This outfit stinM.

585
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,440
Hey stop, there front.

586
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,040
Maybe it 's a trap
rotindiaan of that.

587
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,720
Come, let them 't gold
Just get.

588
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:51,120
We wait here.
We have the maiden indeed.

589
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:56,120
A very pretty girl.
Not a bad idea.

590
01:14:56,279 --> 01:14:57,840
You get 't gold.

591
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,480
You guys are back in three hours or ...
Without expensive horses' s four hours.

592
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,160
Then you leave them here.
But no minute longer.

593
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:11,000
Otherwise we cut
by its beautiful rockfish.

594
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:13,720
That would be a shame.

595
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,560
We seek cover behind the cart
as they took the gold deposit.

596
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,000
They will fall into the trap.

597
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:28,720
Forward, march.

598
01:15:32,359 --> 01:15:34,480
Help.

599
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:40,720
Loosen them. We take them.
They are Ozark.

600
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,000
Do not worry, white friends.

601
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,840
Good idea to give them everything
to retrieve.

602
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,240
The gold in return for the maiden.
Women are now expensive.

603
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:26,760
It would be even nicer to
gold and the girl to have.

604
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,600
If they are dead,
we just suits her.

605
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,600
Yes, then we share her.

606
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:36,800
And? What do you think?

607
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,960
You are very deep
sunk.

608
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:42,960
Natural gas?

609
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:46,240
In this valley blowing the breath
of Manitoe.

610
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:49,960
Who knraads something in the sense
he will kill.

611
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,840
The gas burns.

612
01:18:49,479 --> 01:18:51,200
Quick, back.

613
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,520
Where is the gold?

614
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,680
Halt.

615
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,720
The gold.

616
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,480
Where is the gold?

617
01:19:57,039 --> 01:19:58,920
The Sioux.

618
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:12,000
Manitoe is mad at Red Buffalo
because he chooses crooks.

619
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:14,000
But Manitoe is satisfied ...

620
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:18,160
Red Buffalo as the Ozark helps
to liberate the prisoners.

621
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,680
There it is gold.
Down there.

622
01:20:36,439 --> 01:20:40,440
Nonsense. You lie.
You are clogged.

623
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:44,280
If we do not find
are you coming. Search.

624
01:22:04,359 --> 01:22:06,960
There.
He has the gold.

625
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,200
The Sioux are coming.
Quick, on horseback.

626
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:27,520
Hurry.
Fast horses.

627
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,200
Hurry.

628
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,520
No, no.

629
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:16,560
Let me live. I'm rich.
But you mention price.

630
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:44,920
Red Buffalo has paid.
The Great Spirit will 'm record.

631
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:49,480
Sam, I got him.
Come here.

632
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,960
He was quite.
Come on now.

633
01:23:52,119 --> 01:23:54,560
Yes, I do so.
One moment.

634
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,880
Excuse me. From the rear.
What is it?

635
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:01,560
Never thought
I 'm still would find.

636
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,240
Does that vegetable soup
still no name?

637
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:07,200
Everybody knows it
that he is unknown.

638
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:13,840
But now he gets my name:
herba castlepoolensis gigantis.

639
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,160
Now in this town all sinners
are punished ...

640
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:22,040
the court is very pleased
to establish ...

641
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:25,360
that Major Kingsley
acted from a sense of duty.

642
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:32,400
This was due to his brave
daughter: Mabel Kingsley.

643
01:24:34,359 --> 01:24:37,960
We are also grateful
two men ...

644
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:41,920
which are working
to combat injustice ...

645
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:44,760
and the right to celebrate victory:

646
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,440
The chief of the Apache,
Winnetou ...

647
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,800
and Old Shatterhand.
