1
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:32,287
<i>Out on the Prairie ....</i>

2
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:35,059
<i>....they tell a tale ....</i>

3
00:00:35,686 --> 00:00:37,830
<i>.... Jim Read was riding ....</i>

4
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,007
<i>.... the Comanche trail ....</i>

5
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:42,772
<i>.... he beat Art Downey ....</i>

6
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,510
<i>.... quick to the draw ....</i>

7
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:48,084
<i>.... he obeyed the law ....</i>

8
00:00:48,204 --> 00:00:50,127
<i>.... so he could not fail.</i>

9
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:54,054
<i>A man is as good as his word ....</i>

10
00:00:54,174 --> 00:00:56,579
<i>.... as good as his word is he.</i>

11
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,342
<i>And if he is as good as his word ....</i>

12
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:01,288
<i>.... he's good enough for me.</i>

13
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:08,094
<i>A solemn promise ....</i>

14
00:01:08,895 --> 00:01:10,830
<i>.... he's bound to keep.</i>

15
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:13,320
<i>Or else he never ....</i>

16
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:15,889
<i>.... could fall asleep.</i>

17
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,677
<i>He'll keep his promise ....</i>

18
00:01:19,232 --> 00:01:21,026
<i>.... as best he knows.</i>

19
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,551
<i>And what he sows ....</i>

20
00:01:24,246 --> 00:01:26,129
<i>.... so shall he reap.</i>

21
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:30,043
<i>A man is as good as his word ....</i>

22
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,246
<i>.... as good as his word is he.</i>

23
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:35,075
<i>And if he is as good as his word ....</i>

24
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,414
<i>.... he's good enough for me.</i>

25
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,754
Why don't you buy it?

26
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,548
The hair of the dog.

27
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:20,194
Look .... it is real.

28
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:22,666
From the scalps of the Comanche.

29
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,878
It cost you three pesos.

30
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:38,533
Give me my doll. My doll.

31
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:39,756
It's mine.

32
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,373
Comanche.

33
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:45,700
Guard this woman well. I will claim her
later.

34
00:06:56,436 --> 00:06:58,881
Perhaps we can come to an understanding?

35
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:01,758
A ransom maybe? I have money. I will
pay.

36
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:03,725
Plenty money. Plenty gold.

37
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:06,223
Plenty Comanche scalps.

38
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:10,516
How many times Mr Rose you get $50?

39
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:11,774
You know my name?

40
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:15,291
It's wise to know the name of those who
collect gold for scalps.

41
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:17,508
No. Mercy great chief. Mercy.

42
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:18,653
Don't shoot.

43
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:30,357
Many soldiers coming.

44
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:26,599
Hold your fire.

45
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:29,185
They have crossed into the United
States.

46
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:46,479
Comanche. - Get the scalps on the
wagons. Hurry up.

47
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:18,271
Burn them.

48
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:24,635
Untie them.

49
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:33,785
Let them go.

50
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:35,408
Give them horses.

51
00:10:54,551 --> 00:10:56,751
Comanche scalps in the wagon.

52
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:00,543
Mexicans are enemies but white eyes
are worse.

53
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,756
For each Comanche scalp take ten of
theirs.

54
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:25,478
- Why didn't you save those scalps?
- I was saving my own.

55
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:59,412
We got company.

56
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:00,802
Coming fast.

57
00:12:04,997 --> 00:12:06,009
Comanche?

58
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:09,413
You don't see them until they're on top
of you. Is the patrol out?

59
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:11,780
No, Mr Read just us.

60
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,006
Something's spooking those riders.

61
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:15,721
Better wait and see.

62
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:20,517
It's Downey and his bunch.

63
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:23,157
- Friends of yours?
- Not exactly.

64
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,464
What's your hurry Downey? - Comanche.

65
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:31,649
- They jumped us.
- Why are you in Indian territory?

66
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:33,602
Hunting, there's no law against it.

67
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:36,232
- There ain't no law here.
- We're west of the law.

68
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:39,504
There's the law of the Comanche knife.
Don't rile them

69
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:41,740
I'd like to rile them real good.

70
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:46,086
- It's Peters and Flanagan,
- How did they escape?

71
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:48,083
Thought they was dead for sure.

72
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,882
We were spread-eagle against the wheels.

73
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:59,102
They had brush around our legs.

74
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:01,514
- A Comanche came.
- Quanah?

75
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:05,913
- He told them to let us go.
- Never seen a face like his.

76
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:08,429
His eyes cut wholes right through me.

77
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,766
They gave us horses and turned us loose.

78
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:13,863
Quanah's trying to tell us something.

79
00:13:13,983 --> 00:13:16,177
I know what I'd like to tell him.

80
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,064
I know. You have made a career of
Indian hating.

81
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:22,160
I am telling you, stay out of this
territory.

82
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:25,499
- Escort them to camp.
- Hold on Read.

83
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:28,006
What about our wagons?

84
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:30,909
The whole regiment couldn't get them.

85
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,661
Read ....

86
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,113
You really aiming to keep me away?

87
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:35,124
- First you had me kicked out ......
- You were no good.

88
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:38,538
They say you are pretty good with a gun.

89
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:42,550
Just how good?

90
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:45,313
I manage to stay alive.

91
00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:47,478
I asked you a question.

92
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:49,062
How good?

93
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:50,980
That's your gamble.

94
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:02,604
One time I would have called and drawn.

95
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:04,971
Now here....

96
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:10,171
I say you are Indian lover not fit to
be around whites.

97
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:12,392
Nobody moves.

98
00:15:18,514 --> 00:15:22,227
- Who are you soldier boy?
- Second Lieutenant John French.

99
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,901
Now move or you are under arrest.

100
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:29,331
Alright soldier boy.

101
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:33,466
- I'll be seeing you Read.
- You probably will.

102
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:43,463
You two ride out, see if you can save
any of our scalps.

103
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,152
There's headquarters.

104
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:52,125
The General is probably waiting. Thanks
French and don't forget ...

105
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,548
- ... you're on Downey's list now.
- I'll remember.

106
00:15:56,357 --> 00:15:58,477
- Hello sir.
- You got here fast.

107
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:01,334
You said it was urgent so we cut across
the plains.

108
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:04,352
- With Comanche loose?
- We travelled by night.

109
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:06,912
They hold up at night. Bad medicine.

110
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:11,435
- Day is going to be worse.
- What's the trouble sir?

111
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:13,520
Everything happens at once.

112
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,684
Comanche are raiding again.

113
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:18,394
John Ward is here from Washington.

114
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:21,497
Senor Gonzalez from the Mexican embassy.

115
00:16:22,086 --> 00:16:24,514
Ward wants martial law. I don't.

116
00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:28,614
- But he has the power.
- Big medicine eh?

117
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:32,422
Let's see just how big.

118
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:41,585
We signed the peace treaty in 1848 which
terminated hostilities with Mexico.

119
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:44,405
In 1853 the Gatson Purchase,

120
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,968
We paid $10 million for parts of
this territory.

121
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:53,267
These treaties guaranteed we would stop
the Comanche raids into Mexico.

122
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,543
And return all captives and property.

123
00:16:55,736 --> 00:16:58,569
President Grant told me to stay
until accomplished.

124
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:01,841
If the Comanche don't keep in peacefully, we make them.

125
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:04,516
There's thousands. Who's gonna tell them?

126
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:05,633
You are.

127
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,950
- I don't think so.
- The Army pays you?

128
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,879
As a scout not as a politician. - Read.

129
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:16,956
General Miles says you are the best man
and this is the biggest outbreak.

130
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:19,890
Washington and the nation wants
it stopped.

131
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:22,978
Preposterous this fighting should go
on forever.

132
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:25,740
It's been going on for over 200 years.

133
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,557
Senor Read is correct.

134
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:33,021
The hatred with the Comanche is ancient
noone, in truth, can say when it began.

135
00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:39,456
When the Spaniards first explored in
1707 they were welcomed.

136
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:43,441
The Indians had a tribal belief the
white man would come.

137
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,358
It would be something special - a god.

138
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:49,314
The white man came and it was special.

139
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,431
He discovered silver and forced the
Indians to work the mines.

140
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:58,756
The slave labour paid for by beatings at
the hands of the overseers.

141
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:02,117
The Comanche got sick and rebelled.

142
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,685
They massacred the Spaniards.

143
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:10,425
By the time the Comanche and rest had
avenged themselves ...

144
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:14,375
There wasn't much left of the
settlements they had.

145
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:19,585
There wasn't much left of the people
either. Pretty messy business.

146
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:23,473
The Spaniards then offered a bounty for
every Comanche scalp.

147
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:26,288
Ranging from $25 to $100 a scalp.

148
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:31,210
100 was for a warrior. 50 for a squaw
and the 25 was for a baby.

149
00:18:32,952 --> 00:18:35,539
Correction senor. Since our
independence ...

150
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:37,804
The Mexicans have revoked it.

151
00:18:38,156 --> 00:18:40,830
No longer does Mexico pay for scalps.

152
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,112
Your government is to complimented.

153
00:18:44,232 --> 00:18:48,802
Renegades on both sides got rich. They
made big business out of hunting.

154
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:51,952
Collecting scalps like pelts from
animals.

155
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:54,662
Once they staged a big fiesta ...

156
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:57,208
... invited over 400 Indians ...

157
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,917
... men, women and children. They
massacred them all.

158
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:05,748
So that's how it is. Comanche kill
Mexicans to get even,

159
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:10,027
Mexicans kill Comanche for that and
it becomes a way of life.

160
00:19:11,212 --> 00:19:16,482
I can see that but the Comanche have to
stop or we will be forced to make them.

161
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:21,153
If they knew the bounty for the scalps
had gone it would help.

162
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:24,824
That's right you could base peace talks
on that.

163
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:28,897
I don't know. I think troops are the
answer.

164
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:31,484
They can't go on killing each other
for ever.

165
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:37,702
The Comanche are known as lords of the
plains and they are very proud peoples.

166
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:42,927
Maybe they would talk peace but they
would go again without honourable terms.

167
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:49,265
As President Grant's emissary I am able
to make peace and to get it ratified.

168
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:52,864
Naturally no agreement is good
unless it's fair to both.

169
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:56,695
If we can only get through to Quanah
Parker. - Parker?

170
00:19:57,258 --> 00:20:00,566
Parker? - The chief of the antelopes,
the deadliest tribe.

171
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:02,686
If he stopped all the rest would.

172
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,617
Parker, that's an American name.

173
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:08,502
It's his mothers family name.

174
00:20:08,977 --> 00:20:12,928
- How could any American girl ...
- She was kidnapped.

175
00:20:14,155 --> 00:20:17,304
- Sounds like a frontier legend.
- Not a legend sir.

176
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:21,035
- Have you tried to reach Quanah?
- Sent out runners twice.

177
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:23,907
- They didn't come back.
- How about Quanah ...

178
00:20:24,215 --> 00:20:26,159
... Will he keep his word?

179
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:30,399
He's never violated it. He will keep
his if you keep yours.

180
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:34,415
My integrity is equal to that of
Quanah's.

181
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,108
It's a pretty high plane Commissioner.

182
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:41,747
If you mean it I will try and find
Quanah.

183
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,269
Or let him find me. I will travel
by day.

184
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:49,543
You know since Quanah attacked at
Medicine Lodge ....

185
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,476
... no American has faced him and lived.
- Until today.

186
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:57,209
Downey's hunters were captured and
Quanah freed them.

187
00:20:57,479 --> 00:21:02,270
I've never met him but him freeing those
two men is a sign of peace.

188
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,857
It's your hair. You're not worried
about losing it.

189
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:09,837
I'll tell the quartermaster to sort out
supplies. Who's going?

190
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,911
Next time lets play with four aces.

191
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:24,121
- Him.
- Puffer? That old buzzard.

192
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:27,655
He knows the country as well as I do.

193
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:37,939
What are you doing here? Hiding
from the Indians?

194
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:41,215
At it again? Get to the quartermaster's
tent.

195
00:21:41,805 --> 00:21:45,856
Get some jerk beef, biscuit, beans,
plenty of cartridges.

196
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:49,766
- Where we going ... gold mine?
- Enough for two weeks.

197
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:51,868
Where we going Jim?

198
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:58,023
Where we going? What about the
gold mine?

199
00:21:58,411 --> 00:22:00,797
A social call to the Comanche.

200
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:04,261
Don't mention them critters to me.
I am a sick man.

201
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:08,653
I'd ask them General for a leave of
absence but you couldn't do without me.

202
00:22:08,773 --> 00:22:12,390
- You'd get yourself lost.
- Puffer, just a minute.

203
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,936
Got something for you. Got it in
Santa Fe.

204
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:19,320
- What is it?
- Open it and see.

205
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:24,111
What could it be?

206
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,236
It's the oddest scalp I ever saw.

207
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:34,491
It's not a scalp, it's a wig.

208
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:38,345
- What's it for?
- To keep your bald head warm.

209
00:22:38,674 --> 00:22:42,373
I am sick and tired of hearing you
complain all the time.

210
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:46,612
You look almost human. - Why you ....

211
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,890
Take a look for yourself.

212
00:23:02,427 --> 00:23:05,327
I bet I am the only dude with an
extra scalp.

213
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:07,721
Might come in handy some time.

214
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:19,894
Makes a difference. Long time since I
enjoyed being in cold air.

215
00:23:20,014 --> 00:23:21,925
Good. You wear it no matter.

216
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:24,790
I am not waving the flag, just
remember this.

217
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:28,668
All out war or peace depend upon your
efforts.

218
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:32,202
Thank you . Back in two weeks or
maybe less.

219
00:23:32,322 --> 00:23:35,326
So long. Normally I would say
stay away from Comanche.

220
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:37,346
This is different sir.

221
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:39,225
- Ready Puffer.
- Always.

222
00:23:39,345 --> 00:23:40,373
Let's go.

223
00:24:05,213 --> 00:24:08,031
Good luck Read. You going to need it.

224
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,874
- Why do you say that?
- I got my reasons.

225
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:13,260
Who are you?

226
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:19,130
My name is Downey Commissioner.
Art Downey.

227
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,107
I was Chief Scout til I retired.

228
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,655
Retired? What do you do now?

229
00:24:25,324 --> 00:24:27,144
Prospecting. Buffalo hunting.

230
00:24:28,528 --> 00:24:31,146
What do you know about the Comanche?

231
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:36,395
Well I have lived out here for 20 years.
I taught Jim Read all he knows.

232
00:24:37,663 --> 00:24:40,152
You inferred he would fail. Why?

233
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:45,936
It's nothing personal Jim's one of the
best. It's the thinking that's wrong.

234
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:50,421
You don't send one men to talk to
a tribe.

235
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:53,933
You just don't do it.

236
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:57,068
What do you do?

237
00:24:58,348 --> 00:25:01,225
The Comanche are just plain savages ...

238
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:06,665
... they live by force and obey by force.
Reason and they think you are weak.

239
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:11,280
You got to show them you are stronger.
They respect force.

240
00:25:11,963 --> 00:25:14,334
Just like they respect a cavalry
regiment.

241
00:25:14,698 --> 00:25:19,454
I said the same thing to General
Miles and Read. They felt otherwise.

242
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:23,074
You are the only person who thinks as
I do.

243
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,064
As I said I lived out here for 20 years
and scouted for 6.

244
00:25:28,686 --> 00:25:30,600
I learnt about Indians.

245
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:36,592
Why send one cousin to do business
with another?

246
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,001
Downey ....

247
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:39,974
Yes sir.

248
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,158
You are talking in circles. Whom
are you referring to?

249
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,291
Jim Read and Quanah Parker.

250
00:25:49,242 --> 00:25:50,769
I hope I misheard you?

251
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:54,652
- You say Read is cousin to a savage?
- First cousin.

252
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:57,787
Their mothers were sisters.

253
00:25:58,996 --> 00:26:00,816
Why wasn't I informed?

254
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:03,130
- You mean you weren't?
- I was not.

255
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,606
That makes it worse than ever.

256
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:11,120
Two cousins. Dealing for and against
the Government.

257
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:16,098
Perhaps I should speak to General Miles
about recalling Read.

258
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:52,376
Dang them Comanche ain't never around
when you want them.

259
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:55,922
<i>Out on the Prairie ....</i>

260
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:57,636
<i>.... he hesitates ....</i>

261
00:26:58,587 --> 00:27:00,595
<i>....he's on a journey ....</i>

262
00:27:01,123 --> 00:27:03,249
<i>... to meet with fate ....</i>

263
00:27:03,648 --> 00:27:06,067
<i>.... he keeps on riding ....</i>

264
00:27:06,187 --> 00:27:08,397
<i>.... and takes no rest ....</i>

265
00:27:08,832 --> 00:27:11,039
<i>....for he knows best ....</i>

266
00:27:11,392 --> 00:27:13,693
<i>.... that time won't wait.</i>

267
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:16,772
<i>A man is as good as his word ....</i>

268
00:27:16,892 --> 00:27:19,374
<i>.... as good as his word is he.</i>

269
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:22,145
<i>And if he is as good as his word ....</i>

270
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,499
<i>.... he's good enough for me.</i>

271
00:27:27,082 --> 00:27:30,370
<i>Quanah Parker, the Comanche chief ....</i>

272
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,584
<i>.... is on the warpath and time is
brief ....</i>

273
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:40,950
<i>.... Read knows that Quanah is brave
and just ....</i>

274
00:27:42,032 --> 00:27:46,306
<i>.... they stake their trust on a firm
belief ....</i>

275
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:50,369
<i>A man is as good as his word ....</i>

276
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:52,694
<i>.... as good as his word is he.</i>

277
00:27:52,943 --> 00:27:55,303
<i>And if he is as good as his word ....</i>

278
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,733
<i>.... he's good enough for me.</i>

279
00:28:03,326 --> 00:28:07,389
You know Jim, I can't help looking at
this store here.

280
00:28:08,129 --> 00:28:12,766
I'm getting good natured quicker than it
takes a rooster to make a chicken grin.

281
00:28:32,182 --> 00:28:35,508
It's a Spanish girl. What is she doing
here?

282
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,242
You understand English? Comprende
inglis?

283
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:46,555
Where did you come from?

284
00:28:47,318 --> 00:28:49,666
I ask you, where do you live?

285
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,884
What'll we do the poor thing is plum
loco?

286
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:56,198
- Come on.
- No.

287
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:59,674
I will escape again. It is better
to die.

288
00:29:01,928 --> 00:29:05,345
The blood of my parents is on your
hands. Take them away.

289
00:29:05,465 --> 00:29:08,550
I will not go. You will not do this
to me.

290
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:11,571
We're your friends we are not going
to harm you.

291
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:18,757
Sorry if I hurt you.

292
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:20,942
Are you hungry?

293
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:24,441
I have not eaten since ...

294
00:29:26,026 --> 00:29:29,184
- I don't know when.
- Rustle up some grub Puffer.

295
00:29:42,002 --> 00:29:42,988
Feel better.

296
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:45,313
Muchos gracios senor.

297
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,967
It is a terrible country.

298
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:53,832
No, it's not the country.

299
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:56,027
To me .... it is.

300
00:29:57,544 --> 00:29:58,918
It's frightening.

301
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,677
Where do you live?

302
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:03,990
Durango, senor.

303
00:30:04,848 --> 00:30:07,325
- What's your name?
- Margarita Alvarez.

304
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:09,520
Where are your parents?

305
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:15,062
- The Comanche ...
- Massacred?

306
00:30:15,817 --> 00:30:17,754
- Yes ....
- I am sorry.

307
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:21,852
Comanche ....

308
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:23,955
.... savages.

309
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,499
All should be killed to stop this
murder and torture.

310
00:30:28,946 --> 00:30:31,520
No senorita. That is not the answer.

311
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:36,605
- You defend the Comanche?
- Try to explain them maybe.

312
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:40,270
You think they are humans to be treated
that way?

313
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,079
Most of them can, yes.

314
00:30:43,147 --> 00:30:47,339
You think it was necessary for my
parents to be killed by them?

315
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:50,363
- No, I didn't mean that.
- I hate Comanche.

316
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:52,512
I will always hate them.

317
00:30:57,903 --> 00:30:59,817
- Puffer.
- I ain't deaf.

318
00:31:01,132 --> 00:31:03,950
- They ain't shooting at us.
- Get up there.

319
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:39,666
It's Downey's bunch.

320
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:41,887
Yeh, a little scalping party.

321
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:02,723
We're friends.

322
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,826
What's your tribe?

323
00:32:08,363 --> 00:32:09,339
Antalapa.

324
00:32:09,986 --> 00:32:11,473
Quanah Parker's tribe.

325
00:32:12,062 --> 00:32:15,441
Can you take us to the Chief of the
antelopes?

326
00:32:16,725 --> 00:32:18,256
We come to talk peace.

327
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,757
The white man brings no harm to
our chief?

328
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:30,082
When we meet you chief will need no more
weapons than I have now.

329
00:32:32,431 --> 00:32:35,475
Then I will take the white man to
our chief.

330
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,959
The camp of your chief is not far from
here?

331
00:32:39,636 --> 00:32:41,281
One day? Two days?

332
00:32:43,472 --> 00:32:44,950
He's not at the camp.

333
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:49,709
- He rides with many warriors.
- Returning from a raid?

334
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,834
The last before the cold and snow
set in.

335
00:32:56,902 --> 00:32:59,558
Women light the victory fires even now.

336
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,506
We will rest here.

337
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:06,346
When the sun rises we will ride
together to find your chief.

338
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:11,811
I will tell him when he is before his
warriors ...

339
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:14,072
That he ....

340
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:25,569
I hope he is alright. We might spend
days looking for Quanah without him.

341
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:28,555
Never seen so much paint in all my born
days.

342
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:29,761
What d'ya mean?

343
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,906
Sure glad I got me an extra spell.

344
00:33:39,346 --> 00:33:41,968
We are in no trouble but that girl is.

345
00:33:42,196 --> 00:33:43,718
We came to talk peace.

346
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:47,523
You know, I know it, he knows it but
do the Comanche?

347
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:57,207
Let the young braves kill the whites in
the tribal manner.

348
00:33:57,427 --> 00:34:00,154
We came to talk treaty with the great chief.

349
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:02,732
Is this the way to talk? Kill them.

350
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,259
My brother still lives. We return to
our stronghold.

351
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,905
If my brother dies ... the white men's
deaths will not be as quick as his.

352
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:16,240
We will see your tongue pulled out
by the root.

353
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,674
They are coming.

354
00:35:10,794 --> 00:35:14,193
Quanah brings many things. There is
enough for all.

355
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:31,677
- The western ridge and here's the camp.
- Yep. I figured.

356
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:35,628
We've been looking for this hideout for
years. - No talk.

357
00:35:36,195 --> 00:35:38,306
- That dirty ugly face.
- Silent.

358
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,491
Just one of those days.

359
00:35:43,189 --> 00:35:46,506
It's gonna be worse if Quanah's brother
dies before he speaks.

360
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,941
Morning star.

361
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:47,638
The white men.

362
00:36:48,184 --> 00:36:49,785
I must speak to Quanah.

363
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:05,607
There are many horses and mules.

364
00:37:05,985 --> 00:37:08,360
Many guns, many bullets, much powder.

365
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:12,495
Cloths of many colours. Mexican captives
for those who need them.

366
00:37:18,957 --> 00:37:20,734
There are two white faces.

367
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:26,519
Later we will find out how long they can
live under endless torment.

368
00:37:46,282 --> 00:37:47,461
Great spirit ...

369
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,563
Mighty sun god ...

370
00:37:50,698 --> 00:37:52,238
Here is the body.

371
00:37:53,456 --> 00:37:55,937
His blood has been spilt without reason.

372
00:37:57,872 --> 00:38:00,441
Hear the sorrow and grief of his family.

373
00:38:01,455 --> 00:38:03,425
There is no joy in that song.

374
00:38:04,771 --> 00:38:06,927
Let the sound reach your heart.

375
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,270
Let this youth live.

376
00:38:13,566 --> 00:38:16,724
Give the word now. The white eyes
must die.

377
00:38:34,398 --> 00:38:37,266
By nightfall those Comanche will be
roaring drunk.

378
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:51,173
Worst varmints on the plains.

379
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:54,192
Ever see am man when they have finished?
- Shut up.

380
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:31,669
We have more plans for you.

381
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,997
Torture is for enemies. We come
in peace.

382
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:39,375
I bring big medicine from my chief
to Quanah.

383
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:43,343
Quanah cares nothing for your chief or
his medicine.

384
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:47,636
He grieves for soon he will hear the
death song of his brother.

385
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,398
It is your death song white man.

386
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:15,089
The wig scares them. They think it's
your scalp. Take it off.

387
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:23,012
Has the evil spirit turned you into
women? - His medicine too big.

388
00:40:25,564 --> 00:40:27,578
Your medicine not so big.

389
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:31,656
Now you suffer for two.

390
00:40:35,588 --> 00:40:36,657
Unbind him.

391
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:42,261
Unbind him.

392
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:50,834
These did not lift weapons against my
brother.

393
00:40:51,336 --> 00:40:53,729
They drove away other white men.

394
00:40:54,529 --> 00:40:56,447
They have no enemies in my camp.

395
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,803
My brother lives.

396
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:03,686
Come with me.

397
00:41:24,793 --> 00:41:26,420
Sabby, black jack.

398
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,800
Sabby, food. Sabby, squaw,

399
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:34,026
Nice, very nice. I got me a widow woman
in San Antoine.

400
00:41:37,981 --> 00:41:40,761
When she sets eyes on me and my new
hair,

401
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:44,060
She'll be a shakin and shiverin and a
sight to behold.

402
00:41:45,707 --> 00:41:46,956
And vice versa.

403
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:07,588
Speak ...

404
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:11,019
I come to ask the great chief to a
peace council.

405
00:42:11,741 --> 00:42:12,893
The Americans?

406
00:42:14,054 --> 00:42:16,527
Comanche are at war only with Mexicans.

407
00:42:16,972 --> 00:42:19,189
There is much bad blood and fighting.

408
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:23,174
My people have never first drawn a bow.

409
00:42:23,464 --> 00:42:26,755
Or fired a gun. But there is bad blood
and fighting.

410
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:32,525
The Americans have taken the place where
the grass is thickest and timber best.

411
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:37,197
Instead of hunting game they kill our
braves.

412
00:42:38,563 --> 00:42:40,841
For camp fires they burn our villages.

413
00:42:41,765 --> 00:42:45,372
Our women wail and cut their hair
short for the dead.

414
00:42:46,498 --> 00:42:48,750
Yet Comanche are not weak and blind.

415
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:51,091
They kill Americans like Mexicans.

416
00:42:51,628 --> 00:42:55,191
Their scalps hang in our tepees and
the white women cry.

417
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:57,786
And our women laugh.

418
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:01,391
But it was not begun by us.

419
00:43:02,086 --> 00:43:05,737
The Americans sent out the first
soldier. We sent out the second.

420
00:43:06,225 --> 00:43:10,571
Many seasons ago when the war between
Americans and Mexicans ended ...

421
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:15,823
... The Americans gave much gold for this
land. It belongs to Americans.

422
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:18,892
Soon there were be American forts
and soldiers,

423
00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:22,543
Many Americans will come here to plant
grain and raise cattle.

424
00:43:23,273 --> 00:43:25,578
And dig the earth for gold and silver.

425
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:30,346
This has been agreed by the Mexicans and
Americans? - Yes.

426
00:43:31,903 --> 00:43:33,214
No Comanche?

427
00:43:36,237 --> 00:43:39,131
Gold was given. A line has been changed
in the earth.

428
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,844
The Americans and Mexicans agreed.
No Comanche.

429
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,283
We were here long before the Americans.

430
00:43:46,403 --> 00:43:49,106
And Mexicans but noone thought to
agree with us.

431
00:43:53,645 --> 00:43:55,695
Yet we are not a conquered people.

432
00:43:56,081 --> 00:43:57,638
Noone has defeated us.

433
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:02,124
But ... our numbers still do not
increase.

434
00:44:03,145 --> 00:44:06,092
The Americans are without nothing just
like weeds.

435
00:44:06,892 --> 00:44:08,951
And drops of rain. No end to them.

436
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:11,977
Time has come to walk the path of
the Americans.

437
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:15,324
This has long been on my mind.

438
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,137
Americans are brave. They know many
things we must learn from them.

439
00:44:21,544 --> 00:44:23,603
Or the sun will set on us forever.

440
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,556
The sound of your words is good.

441
00:44:28,568 --> 00:44:30,186
There is another thing.

442
00:44:30,864 --> 00:44:34,163
My country has pledged to stop the
Comanche raids into Mexico.

443
00:44:34,534 --> 00:44:36,593
And to free all captive Americans.

444
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:41,731
The Mexicans still collect gold from the
government for Comanche scalps.

445
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:44,036
Should I treat them as brothers?

446
00:44:44,243 --> 00:44:46,592
They will no longer buy Comanche scalps.

447
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:50,467
I ask you to call the Americans and
Mexicans ... brothers.

448
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:54,320
You ask me to be better than my enemies.

449
00:44:55,905 --> 00:44:57,735
I ask you to be greater.

450
00:45:01,148 --> 00:45:03,717
A great man can grant great favours.

451
00:45:07,843 --> 00:45:10,746
I have heard these words before.
- Where?

452
00:45:11,643 --> 00:45:15,118
Many seasons ago ... from the wife of
my father.

453
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:19,858
The wife of your father and the wife
of my father were sisters.

454
00:45:20,448 --> 00:45:22,084
With the name of Parker.

455
00:45:29,628 --> 00:45:32,302
- We are friends.
- And cousins.

456
00:45:36,289 --> 00:45:38,532
I will call a meeting of the council.

457
00:45:41,163 --> 00:45:43,256
Ohh err ... that young Mexican girl.

458
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:46,679
No harm will come to her?

459
00:45:47,017 --> 00:45:49,761
Oarka and Morning Star care for her
as captive,

460
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:52,242
She belongs to the tribe.

461
00:45:53,061 --> 00:45:54,609
I'd like to help her.

462
00:45:56,272 --> 00:45:57,609
Others desire her.

463
00:45:58,453 --> 00:46:01,330
One man has offered four horses for her.

464
00:46:03,316 --> 00:46:06,897
A man must have fire in his mind to
offer four horses.

465
00:46:07,697 --> 00:46:08,762
Black cloud.

466
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:13,728
I do not question the wisdom of the
council.

467
00:46:13,848 --> 00:46:17,616
It is tribal custom that warriors can
buy their captives.

468
00:46:19,024 --> 00:46:22,670
American's ask us to call Mexicans
brothers and stop our war.

469
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,887
And return the captives unharmed.

470
00:46:26,921 --> 00:46:31,830
Americans ask us ... a race that shoots
without orders from their chiefs.

471
00:46:32,525 --> 00:46:34,487
That kills buffalos it cannot eat.

472
00:46:34,808 --> 00:46:38,476
That fouls the clear waters and changes
our earth ...

473
00:46:38,749 --> 00:46:40,975
Until we cannot live on it anymore.

474
00:46:41,987 --> 00:46:44,987
I do not think of Americans, I think
only of Comanche.

475
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:48,631
And the children of Comanche and
the children from them.

476
00:46:50,118 --> 00:46:52,256
The Americans are here and will stay.

477
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:54,068
We cannot drive them out.

478
00:46:54,188 --> 00:46:58,072
They will grow strong while we will not.
We must learn from them.

479
00:46:58,644 --> 00:47:01,961
So our children will not hunger and
they will be warm in winter.

480
00:47:02,193 --> 00:47:05,255
So they will grow strong as the
Americans are strong.

481
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:10,041
I have told my white cousin that we will
lay down our weapons.

482
00:47:10,551 --> 00:47:12,689
There will be an end to the fighting.

483
00:47:12,809 --> 00:47:14,532
For  a treaty with honour.

484
00:47:15,192 --> 00:47:17,022
Pah, a treaty with honour.

485
00:47:20,978 --> 00:47:23,784
I am among your warriors and your camp.

486
00:47:24,224 --> 00:47:28,042
The end of my time may come today,
that is in your power.

487
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:31,297
I do not speak with a crooked tongue.

488
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:35,136
My chief has pledged the word of my
nation to yours.

489
00:47:35,682 --> 00:47:39,474
And will their be laws to follow like
a conquered people?

490
00:47:40,165 --> 00:47:44,590
There will be laws. Those that obey them
will have the same rights as Americans,

491
00:47:45,505 --> 00:47:48,039
Those who disobey will be punished.

492
00:47:48,514 --> 00:47:50,660
The same as Americans are.

493
00:47:51,395 --> 00:47:53,498
Your chief shall know my decision.

494
00:47:54,061 --> 00:47:55,935
I walk the path of Americans.

495
00:47:56,055 --> 00:47:58,856
Those who this displeases, leave me now.

496
00:47:59,584 --> 00:48:01,344
This is your right.

497
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:05,591
But those who follow me must not
violate my word.

498
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,538
If they do, they will be my enemies.

499
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:12,066
I will hunt them and kill them myself.

500
00:48:13,066 --> 00:48:16,778
It is Comanche custom that no man
leaves unless others follow.

501
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:20,799
- The warriors will follow me.
- I will not ...

502
00:48:22,062 --> 00:48:24,956
... if you make peace with Americans and
Mexicans.

503
00:48:25,783 --> 00:48:28,220
There are others who think as I do.

504
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:47,220
Black Cloud. You have a head for war
and nothing else.

505
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,626
Our paths now separate.

506
00:48:49,925 --> 00:48:52,644
You and your band leave. Take all
your ponies.

507
00:48:53,132 --> 00:48:57,223
Go now and take your braves with you.
The girl and captives stay here.

508
00:48:57,926 --> 00:49:00,179
There is a treaty. They will be free.

509
00:49:34,132 --> 00:49:36,692
It would be better if they had died
in battle.

510
00:49:50,203 --> 00:49:53,371
- You sure you never played black jack?
- One man good.

511
00:49:58,703 --> 00:50:00,692
Beat two kings back to back.

512
00:50:06,165 --> 00:50:07,177
Black Jack.

513
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:10,955
Doggone. That was my last silver
dollar too.

514
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:20,092
How do you feel?

515
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:22,986
I am tired. I am frightened.

516
00:50:24,117 --> 00:50:25,745
Everybody gets frightened.

517
00:50:26,149 --> 00:50:27,399
- You?
- Sure.

518
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:30,408
Never would I think it of you senor.

519
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:34,268
Not frightened.

520
00:50:34,963 --> 00:50:36,828
Not inside of you frightened.

521
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:39,705
- It does not fit.
- It fits.

522
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:43,171
Lie down to see if you can get
some rest.

523
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:47,470
- What happened?
- We are all heading out tonight.

524
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:50,540
Quanah wants Ward and General Miles
for a council.

525
00:50:50,821 --> 00:50:54,138
Will the come they might think it too
risky? - Not the General.

526
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:57,499
- Ward is very anxious about the treaty.
- What about her?

527
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,238
She will have to stay until we get back.

528
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:05,038
Safer anyway with Black Cloud on
the loose.

529
00:51:05,648 --> 00:51:08,938
Quanah is sending a couple of guides
with us.

530
00:51:09,387 --> 00:51:11,261
I'll be back in three days.

531
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:15,000
Get the saddlebags and horse. I want to
be out before the moon comes up.

532
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,722
- Black Cloud wont attack at night.
- We aren't taking chances.

533
00:51:19,752 --> 00:51:21,124
It's too important.

534
00:51:21,766 --> 00:51:25,673
- Maybe we get a medal for this Jim?
- I been thinking Puffer.

535
00:51:26,698 --> 00:51:29,118
Maybe we are wasting our time with
the army.

536
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:32,602
If a man's country is in trouble he
helps or he ain't a man.

537
00:51:32,866 --> 00:51:35,866
Yes but what about the mining. All
that gold.

538
00:51:36,366 --> 00:51:41,627
If the USA seeks to make a messenger out
of me then that there gold can wait.

539
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,463
Stop asking those foolish questions and
let me out to those horses.

540
00:51:53,729 --> 00:51:54,679
Yes ...

541
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:02,057
- I'll tell you when I get back.
- You are going away?

542
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,590
Only for a couple of days.

543
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,511
You will take me with you.

544
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:11,051
You heard what Quanah said. You need to
stay here.

545
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:15,283
I will die before I stay alone with
Comanche.

546
00:52:16,374 --> 00:52:18,521
I am afraid you don't have a choice.

547
00:52:19,784 --> 00:52:21,825
No, I will not stay here.

548
00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:24,623
You will be safe here with Quanah.

549
00:52:25,001 --> 00:52:26,893
Out there is Black Cloud.

550
00:52:30,035 --> 00:52:31,663
I have great fear.

551
00:52:32,815 --> 00:52:34,249
Noone will hurt you.

552
00:52:38,006 --> 00:52:40,571
It is not ... just for ... myself.

553
00:52:41,714 --> 00:52:43,060
That I am afraid.

554
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,019
Margarita.

555
00:53:01,036 --> 00:53:03,148
It is strange to find love here.

556
00:53:04,608 --> 00:53:05,937
Not so strange.

557
00:53:10,301 --> 00:53:11,462
You do not?

558
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:12,923
Just talk?

559
00:53:14,656 --> 00:53:16,266
I do not just talk.

560
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:19,732
I do not know how to say.

561
00:53:19,968 --> 00:53:23,232
With other men who sought my
heart, just nothing.

562
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:25,829
And with me?

563
00:53:28,871 --> 00:53:30,015
I just say ...

564
00:53:30,622 --> 00:53:31,467
Say it.

565
00:53:33,094 --> 00:53:34,757
It's a fire inside of me.

566
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:40,314
I can't believe it is so soon,

567
00:53:42,293 --> 00:53:43,727
So much has happened.

568
00:53:45,202 --> 00:53:47,235
I have not had time to understand.

569
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:51,202
When I get back, I will be your husband,
you will be my wife.

570
00:53:52,654 --> 00:53:54,079
I belong to you know.

571
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,797
In a very special way.

572
00:53:59,005 --> 00:54:01,970
If anything bad happens ...
without you ...

573
00:54:02,757 --> 00:54:04,147
I am so alone.

574
00:54:22,686 --> 00:54:24,428
This is a good place. - Yes.

575
00:54:25,472 --> 00:54:28,877
We live here like our fathers before
us and theirs before them.

576
00:54:30,311 --> 00:54:33,038
We were born here. Where the wind
blows free.

577
00:54:33,346 --> 00:54:37,595
There is nothing to break the light of
the sun. No enclosures and free air.

578
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:42,403
In a way your words are the same as the
fathers of my nation.

579
00:54:43,204 --> 00:54:46,028
Tell your chief we want the Americans and
Comanche to live as brothers.

580
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:48,922
He will be happy to hear your words.

581
00:54:49,191 --> 00:54:51,012
He wishes to be your friend.

582
00:54:51,132 --> 00:54:52,481
He will return too.

583
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:56,818
There is food in your saddlebags and you
will be lead to the waterhole.

584
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,876
From there you go to Palador Springs.
From there you know.

585
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,536
Wherever I am is your home.

586
00:55:07,112 --> 00:55:08,247
I'll be back.

587
00:55:36,919 --> 00:55:38,810
<i>He has a sweetheart ....</i>

588
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,344
<i>.... He aims to wed ....</i>

589
00:55:42,127 --> 00:55:44,115
<i>.... Yet he must leave her ....</i>

590
00:55:44,652 --> 00:55:46,051
<i>.... alone instead ....</i>

591
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:48,897
<i>She knows the danger ....</i>

592
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:51,527
<i>.... to which he goes ....</i>

593
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,193
<i>She prays his foes ....</i>

594
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,533
<i>.... don't kill him dead.</i>

595
00:55:57,758 --> 00:56:00,310
<i>This man is as good as his word ....</i>

596
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,694
<i>.... as good as his word is he.</i>

597
00:56:03,169 --> 00:56:05,747
<i>And if he is as good as his word ....</i>

598
00:56:05,993 --> 00:56:07,823
<i>.... he is good enough for me.</i>

599
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:11,661
Here medicine mound. Sacred.

600
00:56:12,013 --> 00:56:14,459
Man go there to meet great spirits.

601
00:56:15,057 --> 00:56:17,221
Palador Springs, more far.

602
00:56:17,477 --> 00:56:18,189
Okay.

603
00:56:31,002 --> 00:56:32,673
The stars are meeting ....

604
00:56:33,219 --> 00:56:34,881
<i>.... the setting sun.</i>

605
00:56:35,735 --> 00:56:37,512
<i>He has a mission ....</i>

606
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:39,953
<i>.... that drives him on.</i>

607
00:56:40,851 --> 00:56:42,478
<i>I'll keep on going ....</i>

608
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,645
<i>.... he told his friends.</i>

609
00:56:45,765 --> 00:56:47,519
<i>Too much depends ....</i>

610
00:56:48,662 --> 00:56:50,431
<i>.... on how he's done.</i>

611
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:54,117
<i>A man is as good as his word ....</i>

612
00:56:54,346 --> 00:56:56,202
<i>.... as good as his word is he.</i>

613
00:56:56,897 --> 00:56:59,202
<i>And if he is as good as his word ....</i>

614
00:56:59,322 --> 00:57:01,291
<i>.... he's good enough for me.</i>

615
00:57:09,842 --> 00:57:12,331
Black Cloud and his warriors have
been here.

616
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,270
- How long ago?
- Two or three hours maybe.

617
00:57:17,764 --> 00:57:19,849
- Puffer.
- I'm a hurryin'.

618
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:22,378
We playum black jack?

619
00:57:24,613 --> 00:57:27,455
- Sure like to get back my dollar.
- Play one game.

620
00:57:28,018 --> 00:57:29,936
Silver dollar against your scalp.

621
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:33,499
- Not on your darn hope.
- No hurry.

622
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:35,596
I get when you come back.

623
00:57:46,293 --> 00:57:47,674
We go back now.

624
00:57:48,483 --> 00:57:51,431
When the sun leaves the sky three
times we'll be there.

625
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:57,930
I hate this darn country.

626
00:57:58,265 --> 00:58:01,537
Hottie than beans in the daytime
and cold at night.

627
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:02,752
Hurry up.

628
00:58:17,805 --> 00:58:21,034
- Too much smoke for a signal fire.
- Could be a cabin.

629
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:24,131
Yes it could. Let's cut over there.

630
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:20,813
Kids.

631
00:59:38,177 --> 00:59:39,734
Mother and kids.

632
00:59:40,068 --> 00:59:41,326
- Bad?
- Awful.

633
00:59:43,759 --> 00:59:45,967
Stopping Black Cloud will be a
dirty job.

634
00:59:46,087 --> 00:59:48,395
Got to get back to the troops quickly.

635
00:59:49,996 --> 00:59:51,245
Better bury them.

636
01:00:14,195 --> 01:00:15,678
Must be mid morning.

637
01:00:16,241 --> 01:00:17,693
I reckon a bit past.

638
01:00:20,684 --> 01:00:22,470
Must be close to the Springs.

639
01:00:23,139 --> 01:00:25,004
I make it nearer than farther.

640
01:00:33,622 --> 01:00:35,368
Guns. - Yeh, lots of them.

641
01:01:11,198 --> 01:01:14,268
Part of General Miles outfit. Sure
been bushwhacked.

642
01:01:50,831 --> 01:01:52,397
Found you after all.

643
01:01:53,052 --> 01:01:56,140
- What do you mean?
- We were sent out to bring you in.

644
01:01:56,783 --> 01:01:59,677
Then they jumped us. Comanche. About
fifty of them.

645
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,173
Black Cloud.

646
01:02:02,745 --> 01:02:03,810
A Trooper ...

647
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:06,326
... got away ...

648
01:02:06,827 --> 01:02:08,393
... raw hiding for help ...

649
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:11,323
... four or five hours ... ago.

650
01:02:12,911 --> 01:02:14,354
He should be here.

651
01:02:29,074 --> 01:02:31,361
We'll stay here til the Troopers arrive.

652
01:03:18,609 --> 01:03:19,876
The Regiment.

653
01:03:39,344 --> 01:03:41,235
Quanah, the dirty murderer.

654
01:03:41,596 --> 01:03:45,678
- It wasn't Quanah, it was Black Cloud.
- No difference they are Comanche.

655
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:48,353
It's like I told you. You gotta use
force.

656
01:03:48,473 --> 01:03:50,139
- No doubt about it.
- Lieutenant.

657
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,242
Sir. - Arrange a burial detail.

658
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,683
- Quanah must pay for this.
- You are making a big mistake.

659
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:10,753
- Quanah is ready for peace.
- You don't make sense.

660
01:04:10,873 --> 01:04:13,639
I've just come from Quanah. I am
trying to tell you.

661
01:04:13,759 --> 01:04:16,232
You are telling me nothing.
You're through.

662
01:04:16,496 --> 01:04:18,423
Downey is our new chief  scout.

663
01:04:18,903 --> 01:04:22,070
- Quanah's your cousin.
- What difference does that make?

664
01:04:22,378 --> 01:04:27,692
When close relatives negotiate there
is the possibility of personal gain.

665
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,548
Oh, I see.

666
01:04:29,891 --> 01:04:34,000
With Downey here we have no such
problem. We have transferred you away.

667
01:04:36,912 --> 01:04:37,888
Mr Reed,

668
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:40,668
- I haven't finished with you.
- Yes, you have.

669
01:04:45,592 --> 01:04:49,788
We're leaving for the canyon and Quanah.
It will be a tough forced march.

670
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:53,395
I want to get there before sundown.
Lieutenant French. - Sir.

671
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,902
Your troops will move parallel to mine.

672
01:04:56,022 --> 01:04:58,011
Stay five miles off my wing.

673
01:04:58,131 --> 01:05:01,750
If the Indians attack, we will get them
in a cross fire.

674
01:05:02,393 --> 01:05:05,612
General, I must warn you again. Stay
away from that canyon.

675
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:08,546
Still trying to save your cousin's skin?

676
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:11,871
Downey, one more remark and you
will answer to me.

677
01:05:12,637 --> 01:05:14,000
Lieutenant French.

678
01:05:14,704 --> 01:05:16,965
Downey and Merrill will be your scouts.

679
01:05:17,448 --> 01:05:18,987
Read and Puffer, mine.

680
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:21,829
You won't object if I ride with French's
column?

681
01:05:21,949 --> 01:05:24,574
Commissioner, you may ride where
you please.

682
01:05:25,691 --> 01:05:27,556
- Boots in saddles.
- Yes sir.

683
01:05:29,957 --> 01:05:31,770
What happened after I left?

684
01:05:32,104 --> 01:05:35,227
Downey convinced Ward that they
needed to use force.

685
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:39,449
Ward wired the Indian Office and the
War Department and they wired me.

686
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,111
Quanah surrenders or we wipe them out.

687
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:45,648
I am furious but what can I do? Both
my hands are tied.

688
01:05:46,133 --> 01:05:49,274
Quanah's not going to like an ultimatum.
I'll have to tell him.

689
01:05:49,394 --> 01:05:53,092
- Is that why you are leading us?
- I would be arrested if I left alone.

690
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:54,401
So would I.

691
01:05:54,521 --> 01:05:58,508
I tell you. You couldn't hurt Quanah if
you stayed a month. He is impregnable.

692
01:05:59,005 --> 01:06:02,208
We're not due back for 3 days. We must
catch Black Cloud.

693
01:06:02,328 --> 01:06:04,161
Maybe we will be lucky.

694
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:03,354
Ride fast to Quanah. Tell him many
soldiers come for war.

695
01:07:04,173 --> 01:07:06,293
Read spoke with crooked tongue.

696
01:07:06,781 --> 01:07:10,256
Tell him to sound the war cry of
the Comanche braves.

697
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,559
I wait for his words at the end of the
canyon. Go.

698
01:07:56,982 --> 01:07:58,746
What are you stopping for?

699
01:07:58,866 --> 01:07:59,846
Comanche.

700
01:08:01,104 --> 01:08:02,749
See them on the skyline?

701
01:08:10,682 --> 01:08:13,128
Well Lieutenant, what are you
waiting for?

702
01:08:14,905 --> 01:08:16,084
I don't know.

703
01:08:16,944 --> 01:08:20,375
- I better notify the General.
- I will take the responsibility.

704
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,282
Well Lieutenant.

705
01:08:33,036 --> 01:08:33,942
Well ....

706
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:37,057
Forward.

707
01:09:51,225 --> 01:09:53,481
Where in blazes is that other column?

708
01:09:55,329 --> 01:09:59,666
Head for Medicine Mound. You can see for
miles. Comanche only go there to die.

709
01:10:00,515 --> 01:10:01,518
Forward.

710
01:10:17,454 --> 01:10:18,589
See anything?

711
01:10:21,659 --> 01:10:22,548
Nothing.

712
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:24,434
Not a thing.

713
01:10:25,473 --> 01:10:27,285
How far is it to Quanah's camp?

714
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:29,165
Not far.

715
01:10:30,071 --> 01:10:31,795
- Let's go.
- Oh, General.

716
01:10:32,358 --> 01:10:34,320
I'll take you there but not them.

717
01:10:36,577 --> 01:10:39,040
- You're in command until I get back.
- Sir.

718
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:39,920
Thanks.

719
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,339
You'll see the female he's pining for.

720
01:10:42,459 --> 01:10:45,594
Female. Name of Margarita. You can
conduct his wedding.

721
01:10:57,548 --> 01:10:58,753
Black Cloud.

722
01:11:16,949 --> 01:11:18,493
That's French's column.

723
01:11:19,601 --> 01:11:21,660
Well they have been asking for it.

724
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:26,728
- They have got them trapped now.
- I'd like a crack at them.

725
01:11:26,946 --> 01:11:29,937
Go down and tell them to get away from
the fence. - Sir.

726
01:11:31,925 --> 01:11:35,805
- But I don't think ....
- I'll take the responsibility.

727
01:11:36,579 --> 01:11:37,542
Forward.

728
01:11:50,734 --> 01:11:52,353
Get back. It's a trap.

729
01:11:52,473 --> 01:11:53,549
Generals orders.

730
01:11:53,743 --> 01:11:56,338
What are you afraid of soldier boy?

731
01:11:57,930 --> 01:11:58,889
Get back.

732
01:12:59,239 --> 01:13:02,204
I am a friend of the Comanche. I come
from Washington.

733
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:03,990
I'm your white brother.

734
01:13:07,192 --> 01:13:08,784
Then it is you ...

735
01:13:09,142 --> 01:13:11,685
... who bring the white-eyes to foul
our land.

736
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:14,166
No, no. I come to protect you.

737
01:13:14,286 --> 01:13:15,213
No. no.

738
01:15:38,648 --> 01:15:39,766
General Miles.

739
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:42,202
Listen to me General Miles.

740
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:46,337
Black Cloud will let me go if you let
him out of the canyon.

741
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:04,359
- Does your white brother let you die?
- Miles, please Miles.

742
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:11,550
Please ....

743
01:16:12,008 --> 01:16:13,134
Please ....

744
01:16:19,903 --> 01:16:23,018
You want to take the deal? A mans
life is at stake.

745
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:27,777
Ranchers lives are at stake, families
too. If that butcher is turned loose.

746
01:17:40,637 --> 01:17:44,143
- This time Black Cloud is trapped.
- You ahead and Quanah behind.

747
01:17:44,263 --> 01:17:48,137
- If Quanah stays religious.
- I'd stake my life on that.

748
01:17:48,257 --> 01:17:49,536
You already have.

749
01:17:57,755 --> 01:17:59,057
Black Cloud.

750
01:18:01,336 --> 01:18:03,034
Here is your scout.

751
01:18:04,019 --> 01:18:06,315
He has brought me your words.

752
01:18:08,453 --> 01:18:10,116
Here is my answer.

753
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,388
Black Cloud.

754
01:18:31,403 --> 01:18:32,432
You die.

755
01:18:46,303 --> 01:18:47,315
Raise ...

756
01:18:48,556 --> 01:18:49,708
Pistols ...

757
01:18:50,271 --> 01:18:51,239
Charge.

758
01:21:52,039 --> 01:21:56,024
Where did you find my hair. I've been
looking all over these rocks for it?

759
01:22:00,132 --> 01:22:02,591
Ain't never found it so hard to
stay alive.

760
01:22:15,945 --> 01:22:20,264
I know this man's heart. What he has
told me, I have in my heart.

761
01:22:20,812 --> 01:22:24,349
I am tired of fighting. I do not want my
young men to die.

762
01:22:25,044 --> 01:22:27,604
I do not want my old to wail for the
dead.

763
01:22:28,352 --> 01:22:29,839
Let us be free men.

764
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,376
Free to chose our own teachers.

765
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:35,148
Free to follow in the religion of
our fathers.

766
01:22:35,351 --> 01:22:37,647
Free to think and act for ourselves.

767
01:22:38,105 --> 01:22:40,128
We will keep the peace faithfully.

768
01:22:40,515 --> 01:22:44,157
Or from where the sun now stands, we
will fight no more.

769
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:46,049
Forever.

770
01:22:48,724 --> 01:22:51,750
My chief wants to start with no bad
memories.

771
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:55,339
We'll make a new beginning and put
the fighting behind us.

772
01:22:55,459 --> 01:22:57,407
My country has pledged it's word.

773
01:22:57,786 --> 01:23:00,681
That our treaty will not be broken
by a white man.

774
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:23,517
<i>This is the story ...</i>

775
01:23:23,711 --> 01:23:25,286
<i>... there is no more.</i>

776
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:28,541
<i>It's written plainly ...</i>

777
01:23:28,766 --> 01:23:30,446
<i>... in western law.</i>

778
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:33,552
The man who's truthful ...

779
01:23:33,672 --> 01:23:35,575
<i>... he'll make his way.</i>

780
01:23:36,121 --> 01:23:37,968
<i>That's true today ....</i>

781
01:23:38,737 --> 01:23:40,470
<i>... as days of yore.</i>

782
01:23:41,258 --> 01:23:43,571
<i>A man is as good as his word ...</i>

783
01:23:43,932 --> 01:23:45,964
<i>... as good as his word is he.</i>

784
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,797
<i>If you are as good as your word ...</i>

785
01:23:48,994 --> 01:23:51,414
<i>... you are good enough ...</i>

786
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:56,677
<i>... for me.</i>
