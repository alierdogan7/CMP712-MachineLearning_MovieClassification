Over a hundred years ago,

33
00:01:33,504 --> 00:01:35,536
the wife of one of our founding fathers

34
00:01:35,538 --> 00:01:37,538
buried a time capsule.

00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:40,171

00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:53,092
I buried it here myself in 1906.

00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:55,594
With a new library coming to this site,

43
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:58,749
it's time to unearth the past. Alright.

44
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,324

53
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:40,851

OK?

73
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,148

thousands of square
miles of forest, foothills,

00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,267

- Yeah,

00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,793

Oh, nothing. It's just, um...

79
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,369
It's been a long time since
I said it out loud.

00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:54,651
You know, sounds a

81
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:56,166

82
00:03:56,205 --> 00:04:00,664

enclaves of evil. Proceed.

00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:03,112
Yes, Waverly, "proceed."

84
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:04,602
Um, ahem...

85
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:06,113
So the Triangle
seems to act as some sort

86
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:08,728
of prison, right? Any
revenants who try to cross

87
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:11,608
- the boundaries...
- Wait-wait! I know this one.

88
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:13,568
Daddy said, "Peeps who
try to cross the boundary

89
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:15,863
- suffer hell on earth."
- They're not people.

90
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,117
- They used to be.
- OK, so these outlaws-turned-demons,

91
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:20,254
- can you ID them?
- Um, yeah, well...

92
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:24,622
I... I-I had some names in this
ledger, right, which, uh...

93
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:27,618
which was... Anyway.

94
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:30,801
Um, I can still make out a
few of them from old photos,

95
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:33,430
and I have a really, really
good hunch about some others.

96
00:04:33,503 --> 00:04:36,216
OK, well, my
superiors frown upon hunches.

97
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:38,581
So if this Triangle is a
prison, then we're the wardens.

98
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:42,336
I mean, we gotta identify the
prisoners and keep them contained.

99
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,059
By shooting them in the face.

100
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:46,488

101
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:49,282

homestead and killed our sister.

See how he moves? Freaky.

174
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:56,150
Could be mimicking a
hellhound. Strong, fast,

175
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:58,635
finely tuned sense of smell...

176
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:05,286
(gunshot)

177
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:08,426
<i>Girly, you killed your own daddy.</i>

178
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:12,193
Did our work for us! (crazy laughing)

179
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:13,794
Earp.

180
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:16,296
He's one of the Seven.
He was there that night.

181
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:18,807
What did they want with a
book and an old dude's paw?

182
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:20,583
All these items are carefully curated.

183
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,836
My theory is that they're
collecting rarities

184
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:24,977
- for a ritual.
- What, like Voodoo?

185
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:27,577
Uh, more like Dark-Ages
European than Haitian.

186
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,159
Sometimes, you come
so close to cool, and

187
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:31,965
- then cool makes a run for it.
- The victim was Mel Cleghorn.

188
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:34,431
50 years ago, he was charged with
the killing of his girlfriend.

189
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:37,451
All evidence pointed to his
guilt, but he was let off.

190
00:09:37,521 --> 00:09:42,690
And legend has it the left hand of
an innocent murderer can open gateways.

191
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,903
They're trying to get out of
the Ghost River Triangle.

192
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:46,773
They can't. It's impossible.

193
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:49,076
- I hope so.
- OK, a mute's voice,

194
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:51,518
- an innocent killer; what's next?
- Now, these things

195
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,589
<i>usually come in
threes, mundus triformis.</i>

196
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,760
- Uh?
- It's a kind

197
00:09:56,795 --> 00:10:01,083
of paradox, like cold
fire, the living dead.

198
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,581
- Ohhh, OK.
- Yeah.

199
00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:05,275
I'll keep my eyes open for a zombie
wearing an icy-hot patch.

200
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,167
Come on, Earp, this ain't no
joke. If the revenants escape,

201
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:10,095
they can scatter to the
four corners of the world,

202
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:13,207
ignite a shit storm of
rape, murder, pillaging.

203
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:14,990
Well, the pillaging, we could handle.

204
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:17,876
OK, where are you going? We've
got work to do. Earp!

205
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:20,178
Earp! We've got a
description of the van.

206
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:23,856
<i>Yeah. I need to think. And
tequila. Mucho tequila.</i>

207
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,906
Sir! what are you doing?!

208
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,243
- Sir!
- (Marty growling)

209
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,712
No! NO!

210
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:43,077
- (Marty laughing)
- (man screaming)

211
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:46,907
Oh, so that's why you're
here? You're running a book?

212
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:49,166
On frontier life. But I am lately

213
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:51,252
stumped. I seek the name and likeness

214
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:53,977
of a figure once
prominent in these parts.

215
00:10:54,093 --> 00:10:55,936
Well, I have collected

216
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,438
<i>almost every back issue of
the Ghost River Chronicle.</i>

217
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:01,907
A bit of a local history nut myself.

218
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,179
So, this guy that you're looking for...

219
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:06,716
- It's a woman.
- OK...

220
00:11:06,762 --> 00:11:08,005
Um...

221
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,530
Ooh! Here we go!

222
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,532
Look familiar?

223
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:14,419
"Big Nose Kate."

224
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,044
Long-time companion of
a famous gunslinger...

225
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:20,517
_

226
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:24,424
Not the filly I'm
looking for. Think blonde.

227
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:27,096
Think striking.

228
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:29,734
Men always do.

229
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,058
Why don't you look up the
"Last spike" ceremony.

230
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:34,328
I may recall her being there...

231
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:36,807
so I've read.

232
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:38,871
Of course.

233
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,603
OK...

234
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:43,860
"May, 1882."

235
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:46,756
No. No photos.

236
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:48,710
Recognize any names?

237
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:51,514
_

238
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:57,795
Well, I appreciate the help,

239
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,798
- but I best be heading off.
- Oh.

240
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:04,468
- (musical ringtone playing)
- Oh. Uhhh...

241
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,336
So...

242
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:09,366
if I do find anything, uh,

243
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:10,790
where are you staying?

244
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:12,725
A place young ladies should not venture.

245
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,710
A trailer park,
proprietered by one Bobo Del Rey.

246
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:17,229
(indistinct chatter)

247
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:18,849
O... Oh.

248
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:21,554
Much obliged, ma'am.

249
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:29,860
- OK.
- (door closing)

250
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:31,829
(birds singing)

251
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:36,033
Hey, Daddy. Hi, Willa.

252
00:12:38,788 --> 00:12:40,871
Sorry, I don't visit much,

253
00:12:40,873 --> 00:12:43,123
but you're not even in there.

254
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:46,543
Nothing but sand in your casket.

255
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:48,929
(sighs)

256
00:12:51,183 --> 00:12:53,133
This is your gig.

257
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:56,720
You should be doing
this. You were meant to.

258
00:12:58,307 --> 00:13:00,274
I miss you guys so damn much.

259
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:02,893
(shoveling sounds)

260
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:05,529
(Man): The numbers.
I need those numbers.

261
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,450
Little respect here? Trying to have

262
00:13:09,485 --> 00:13:12,820
- a moment with my family!
- He'll tell me the numbers!

263
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:15,906
(shoveling sounds)

264
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:20,878
Whoa! Pretty sure this is illegal.

265
00:13:20,913 --> 00:13:23,247
Sam wants the numbers.

266
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:25,249
Stan knows them.

267
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:28,552
- Just gotta ask him.
- Hmm, doubt you're gonna

268
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:30,420
get much out of Johnny McDead here.

269
00:13:30,422 --> 00:13:33,257
- You OK, pal? Off your meds?
- Three of them

270
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:35,759
made me what I am!

271
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:38,762
BANG! Where I am? Hell? Must be Hell.

272
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:42,599
But I come back!

273
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:47,571
(growling)

274
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:52,242
You.

275
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:54,244
- Never going back.
- Oh,

276
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,115
you're going back,
revenant. And you're gonna burn.

277
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:02,119
(panting)

278
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:11,628
Christ, he is fast!

279
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,881
(sighing)

280
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:26,643
I ran the name on the
headstone. Stanley Gatewood.

281
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:29,313
- Hello to you too, Dolls.
- Managed the Bank of Purgatory

282
00:14:29,365 --> 00:14:31,315
in the 70s. Hired a
man by the name of Marty

283
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:33,567
who took great pleasure in
foreclosing on farmers.

284
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:35,652
Why didn't you shoot him?

285
00:14:35,654 --> 00:14:37,704
He moves like he's krumping, remember?

286
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,325
But he dropped this...

287
00:14:41,377 --> 00:14:43,076
You're welcome.

288
00:14:43,128 --> 00:14:45,963
(Dolls sighs) Passwords? Bank accounts?

289
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:48,715
Combination? But the Bank of Purgatory

290
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:51,134
- is now a surplus store.
- Contractors build around

291
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,970
old vaults that are too
big to move. Down that coffee

292
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:56,340
- and we'll go.
- It's really hot.

293
00:14:56,342 --> 00:14:59,393
Fine! Hmm!

294
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:08,352
♪ ♪

295
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:11,438
There, the van. We're too late.

296
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,024
OK, we're gonna take cover and regroup.

297
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:16,443
We don't want to tip them off.

298
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:18,612
Good thing we're not
driving a giant narcmobile.

299
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:22,032
Yeah, it's just a
two-inch clamp for my tow hook.

300
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:24,034
Think it'll be expensive?

301
00:15:24,086 --> 00:15:26,703
Less than the ring you owe Waverly.

302
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:29,539
- Oh, sorry.
- (Marty growling)

303
00:15:29,592 --> 00:15:31,541
Look at that body.

304
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:33,543
I call dibs!

305
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:35,545
Thanks. I get that a lot.

306
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:36,880
Shit!

307
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:39,549
Everybody on the ground!

308
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:42,769
- Plan B, boys, we got company!
- Ah!

309
00:15:44,356 --> 00:15:47,107
Stay back! We got hostages!

310
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:50,360
Go!

311
00:15:55,784 --> 00:15:58,264
Hostages. Good, right? Means they're
not going to kill them.

312
00:15:58,265 --> 00:15:59,518
Not yet.

313
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,248
Everybody hand over your phones. Now.

314
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,613
Who still carries phones, right?

315
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:09,420
Don't make me damage what
will soon be mine!

316
00:16:09,472 --> 00:16:12,590
Don't do this, fellas. You
haven't hurt anybody yet.

317
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:15,092
Just take what's in the register,
leave out the back.

318
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:18,262
(revenants laughing)

319
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:24,768
Ugh! Ah!

320
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,104
- (Shorty moaning)
- Keep your head!

321
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:29,190
That bitch outside can send
us all back to Hell,

322
00:16:29,242 --> 00:16:31,442
and these hostages are our
only bargaining chips!

323
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:34,278
You and you, head to the back!
You behind the desk, follow 'em.

324
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,614
Get him off the floor!

325
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,116
- Now!
- (Shorty moaning)

326
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:41,285
We're close, boys! Marty, move
your ass, find the vault.

327
00:16:41,337 --> 00:16:43,454
Gary, you help him.

328
00:16:43,456 --> 00:16:45,456
Alone?

329
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,758
Why are we not going in
there and shooting these bastards?

330
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:49,128
Do the odds. You think we can subdue

331
00:16:49,153 --> 00:16:50,427
all three before they kill anyone?

332
00:16:50,463 --> 00:16:54,215
- (siren call)
- Oh, the cavalry. Just in time.

333
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:56,133
(Wynonna) Ah, great.

334
00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:58,135
Got a report of shots fired,

335
00:16:58,187 --> 00:17:00,137
hostage situation. I call the Tac team?

336
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:02,070
It'll take them an hour
to get here from the city.

337
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:03,175
You take your cues from me.

338
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:05,392
So we just stand around with
our thumbs up our asses?

339
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:08,612
And if that's how you've
been trained, feel free.

340
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:12,483
Hostage taking is
about bargaining, right?

341
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:14,618
We have things they want.

342
00:17:14,654 --> 00:17:17,655
- The combination?
- And the Earp heir.

343
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:19,657
No. Too risky. They'll kill you.

344
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:22,243
You said it yourself, they're
trying to piece together

345
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:23,837
some kind of spell, so if they think

346
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:25,379
I can help them get what they want,

347
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:27,665
then that's gotta be worth
every person in there.

348
00:17:31,837 --> 00:17:33,837
Give this to whoever's in charge.

349
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,403
- And...
- Never get into a vehicle,

350
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:36,840
never move to a second location.

351
00:17:36,842 --> 00:17:38,809
You've been in a
hostage situation before?

352
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:41,679
- Sort of.
- This time, you're the law,

353
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:43,814
and innocent people
are depending on you.

354
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:46,560
- Now, your gun.
- What?!

355
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:49,353
They're not gonna let you in
there with it. I'll get it

356
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:51,021
back to you, Earp. I promise.

357
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:10,841
Ok.

358
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:12,927
Here goes.

359
00:18:28,978 --> 00:18:31,061
(door unlocking)

360
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:35,532
- You know who I am, right?
- Oh, yeah.

361
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:37,302
Take me in exchange for the hostages,

362
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:39,060
and I'll help you get what you need.

363
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:45,242
Come on!

364
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:49,630
You need to talk to my boss.

365
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:51,632
(cell phone ringing)

366
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:54,084
<i>- See your hands.
- Tell me what you want.</i>

367
00:18:54,086 --> 00:18:56,086
I'll release some hostages,

368
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:58,922
but if you try
anything, people will die.

369
00:18:58,924 --> 00:19:00,881
The Black Badge Division has facilities

370
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,617
outside the Ghost River Triangle,

371
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:05,095
<i>and if you harm one
hair on my deputy's head,</i>

372
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:07,481
I guarantee you a
fate much worse than death.

373
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:11,435
Come on!

374
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,270
(Beep!)

375
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:15,356
What happened?

376
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:18,776
- Shorty's hurt.
- Just my angina acting up.

377
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:20,705
You go into a surplus store, you're

378
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,553
bound to come across a few tools.

379
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:24,698
The women and the clerk can go.

380
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,116
Hey! Hey!

381
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:28,619
I said it's me in
exchange for all the hostages.

382
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:31,134
Yeah, well, we need three of you, so...

383
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:31,979
For what?

384
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:34,792
Come on.

385
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:38,962
Oh, you're welcome! No
problem. Hey, tchk!

386
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:42,383
Pfff!

387
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:45,185
(indistinct police radio)

388
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,890
When they come back, we need to create

389
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:52,476
a diversion. How do you
feel about flashing the twins?

390
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:55,946
- (growling, multiple stabbing)
- (Gary) No, Marty! Please! No!

391
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:58,032
What's the plan, Deputy Marshal?

392
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:00,734
We surround the store. You
get a clear shot, let me know.

393
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:02,820
- OK.
- We hear shots, we go in.

394
00:20:02,872 --> 00:20:05,989
Call Waverly. Tell her that
her sister's in a situation.

395
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:08,826
OK. Isn't that Champ's truck?

396
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:11,879
- Waverly's boyfriend?
- Unfortunately...

397
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:17,251
Consider my plot vacated.

398
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:19,336
- (key clinking)
- (motorcycle roaring)

399
00:20:19,338 --> 00:20:21,472
It was never yours, hombre.

400
00:20:24,143 --> 00:20:25,820
Now, you weren't stupid enough to

401
00:20:25,845 --> 00:20:27,644
let yourself be followed, were you?

402
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,515
Never. Now listen here, Bobo Del Rey.

403
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:34,852
I found Killer Miller, I
dragged Levi across the line.

404
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:37,237
But just so I don't feel like
I owe you anything else,

405
00:20:37,273 --> 00:20:40,324
I think it's best I put
some distance between us.

406
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,860
Where are you gonna go?

407
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:45,612
Anywhere under the stars.

408
00:20:45,664 --> 00:20:47,698
See, unlike your type,

409
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,284
I can roam far and wide.

410
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:53,587
Although from what I hear
around your little enclave,

411
00:20:53,622 --> 00:20:58,208
some of your cronies, oh, they're
itching to wander too.

412
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:06,016
Well, they can try, but the
only way out of the Triangle

413
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:07,885
is with me.

414
00:21:07,937 --> 00:21:10,053
Henry...

415
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:12,973
I know you've been looking for her...

416
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:15,893
been coming up a little... empty.

417
00:21:15,895 --> 00:21:18,395
Why, I don't know who you're...

418
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:20,197
No, you don't know who.

419
00:21:20,232 --> 00:21:22,399
Stone Witch?

420
00:21:24,236 --> 00:21:26,036
There it is.

421
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:29,323
Your instincts are
correct. She is close.

422
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,993
And yes, she has
been giving some of my...

423
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:36,296
weaker brethren some ideas of escape.

424
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:38,415
But I have her name.

425
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,885
- You give it to me.
- Just hold on now.

426
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:43,887
The word is...

427
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:46,223
Wynonna Earp's taken a shine to you.

428
00:21:46,258 --> 00:21:48,225
- (crow cawing)
- We can use that.

429
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,228
You son of a bitch, I
do not work for you.

430
00:21:51,263 --> 00:21:54,231
You get the heir...

431
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,934
to trust you. Have her think that, uh,

432
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:59,820
you're on her side. (Bobo sniffing)

433
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:03,190
Hell, once you get close to Wynonna,

434
00:22:03,242 --> 00:22:05,242
you'll be getting plenty on the side.

435
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,112
Then, and only then...

436
00:22:11,116 --> 00:22:13,500
you'll get the name. But first...

437
00:22:13,536 --> 00:22:16,587
(musical ringtone playing)

438
00:22:16,622 --> 00:22:18,922
God, not now!

439
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,792
Deal with that... or I will.

440
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:30,467
You stupid girl.

441
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,969
(gunshot)

442
00:22:33,772 --> 00:22:36,781
- Ow! Ow! Wrist burn!
- You want your friends to live,

443
00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:38,041
you're gonna do something for us.

444
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:39,860
What the hell?!

445
00:22:39,895 --> 00:22:42,813
(Marty roaring)

446
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:47,651
Easy, Marty. The witch chose
us three for a reason.

447
00:22:47,703 --> 00:22:51,121
Each of us guarding a
different piece of the puzzle!

448
00:22:51,156 --> 00:22:52,823
I knew about the hand, Gary hid

449
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,409
the stupid book; now I
need you to get your piece!

450
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:59,162
We didn't trust each
other and now look what I done!

451
00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:01,632
Put down the knife! The
heir's gonna help us!

452
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:04,167
I do know the numbers.

453
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,971
'Least, I did!

454
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:11,008
You got your ass put
down by an Earp too, Gary!

455
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,595
Sam and I waited 15 years

456
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:18,181
for you to come back so you
could find the damn diary.

457
00:23:18,234 --> 00:23:20,684
So be quiet!

458
00:23:20,736 --> 00:23:23,153
- This seems to be going well.
- Shut up!

459
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:25,188
You can kill us, right?

460
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,858
Can you fix us? Bring Gary back.

461
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,193
That's not how the curse works.

462
00:23:30,195 --> 00:23:32,195
I didn't put him
down with the Peacemaker.

463
00:23:32,197 --> 00:23:34,781
- He'll resurrect again soon.
- When?

464
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:38,335
We don't have time for...
If you're not gonna help us,

465
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,204
- I'm gonna...
- Wait! Wait!

466
00:23:41,257 --> 00:23:43,206
Krumper here dropped
this when I chased him

467
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:45,208
through the cemetery.

468
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:47,794
Not quite a combination, but
there are repeated sequences.

469
00:23:47,846 --> 00:23:51,632
So you're saying you can open it?

470
00:23:51,684 --> 00:23:53,310
Wouldn't be the first time I got

471
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:54,909
all up in a 24-bolt Diebold.

472
00:23:58,057 --> 00:23:59,056
Marty!

473
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:04,645
(growling)

474
00:24:04,697 --> 00:24:06,280
Put a muzzle on it.

475
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:11,902
(clicking)

476
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,624
(door closing)

477
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,910
- Oh, hey, Henry.
- The hell were you doing

478
00:24:19,962 --> 00:24:21,912
- tailing me?
- I...

479
00:24:21,914 --> 00:24:24,247
What are you doing with Bobo Del Rey?

480
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:25,999
None of your business!

481
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:28,251
You don't know what he did to my family?

482
00:24:29,972 --> 00:24:32,889
You don't know what he is?

483
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:36,259
Little girl, you do not know what I am.

484
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:41,014
I know what you're supposed to be.

485
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:43,066
You're supposed to be a hero.

486
00:24:44,737 --> 00:24:49,656
You're supposed to be Wyatt
Earp's best friend!

487
00:24:49,692 --> 00:24:52,609
You're supposed to be here to help us!

488
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:54,444
- (loud slap)
- Wavrrly Earp,

489
00:24:54,496 --> 00:24:58,031
you pull your head out of the past.

490
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,033
You let it die, you change your name.

491
00:25:00,085 --> 00:25:02,035
You do whatever it takes

492
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:04,037
to get through that
vapid brainpan of yours.

493
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:06,673
Because if anybody is gonna clear

494
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:08,625
the Earp name and pull this place

495
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:10,794
out of misery...

496
00:25:10,796 --> 00:25:13,630
it sure as hell ain't gonna be

497
00:25:13,632 --> 00:25:16,883
the heir's pitiful, little sister!

498
00:25:16,935 --> 00:25:18,935
(objects shattering)

499
00:25:20,806 --> 00:25:23,023
You forgot stupid...

500
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:27,644
for thinking you're anything
more than just another a-hole.

Ah!

503
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:43,660
(sighing) There. One more.

504
00:25:43,662 --> 00:25:46,296
I could guess the first two,
but the last one, not so much.

505
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:48,165
- So you can't open it?!
- I'll kill her!

Guys! I'm doing this

Oh, we'll get through.
