1
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:46,440
Peace.

2
00:01:46,652 --> 00:01:48,650
You are far from the reservation.

3
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,462
We carry no arms.

4
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:54,536
The treaty says you can't leave
without permission.

5
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,182
No guns, no bows and arrows.

6
00:01:57,373 --> 00:02:00,615
In the north,
ranches were burned, people murdered.

7
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,272
We search for those who did this.

8
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:05,994
To the south
we trade with our brothers.

9
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:09,416
In peace we return
to our farms and women.

10
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:12,252
Next time, obey the treaty.

11
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:38,073
The Colonel will be disappointed
to have nobody to shoot at.

12
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:40,030
Yeah.

13
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,772
Come in.

14
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:51,999
Lieutenant Hewitt is here, sir.

15
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:53,802
Send him in.

16
00:02:53,837 --> 00:02:55,534
Lieutenant?

17
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:56,570
Welcome back, Hewitt.

18
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,356
Thank you, Captain.

19
00:02:58,391 --> 00:02:59,786
What did you find?

20
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:02,753
We ran across a band of Cheyenne.

21
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:05,416
But not the renegades we want.

22
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,673
How do you know?

23
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:10,479
They came from the south.
They were unarmed.

24
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:14,025
But they were illegally
off the reservation.

25
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,556
They said it was a trading mission.

26
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:18,507
"They said."

27
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:19,474
Have the bugler sound assembly.

28
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:21,271
Yes, sir.

29
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:23,072
What are you gonna do?

30
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:24,591
Teach them a lesson.

31
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:27,060
Double the ammunition ration.

32
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:28,580
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:30,375
You can't do that.

34
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,937
Don't forget yourself, Lieutenant.
Dismissed.

35
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:36,475
We don't attack friendly tribes.

36
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,760
I preserve treaties and keep the
peace. I said you were dismissed.

37
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:49,315
Every other tribe - the Paiute, the
Comanche - will use it as an excuse
to join the Cheyenne on the warpath.

38
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,494
Not with me here to stop them.

39
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:53,536
And south of here?

40
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:54,710
South?

41
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:59,432
Texas, sir. The South's used all
its manpower in the Confederate army.

42
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:06,223
We're fighting the South.
If putting Indians on the warpath
helps us to win, I've no objection.

43
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,775
We're not fighting
against women and children.

44
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,428
There's hardly any men left in Texas.

45
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:16,718
Your being from Texas wouldn't
have anything to do with it?

46
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,211
A man fights
for what he thinks is right.

47
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:24,568
You're being insubordinate. And
you're in the wrong colour uniform.

48
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:27,981
One of us is dressed wrong, Colonel.

49
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:33,349
Lieutenant, you're under arrest and
confined to quarters until I return.

50
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:41,594
You fixed yourself up good,
didn't you?

51
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:43,156
Did you hear what he said?

52
00:04:43,486 --> 00:04:45,459
I got ears.

53
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,678
Well, remember it.

54
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:08,018
Lebbard?

55
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:09,231
Yes, sir?

56
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:12,144
See this gets to General Firewell.

57
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,538
What are you gonna do?

58
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,248
Somebody's got to warn the settlers.

59
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,632
You know what'll happen if you leave

60
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,164
I'll worry when the time comes.

61
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,661
You're just being plain crazy.

62
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:53,891
Charge!

63
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:41,820
Hey, ain't you misread your compass
needle? This is the Texas border.

64
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,841
I know.
Have you had any Indian trouble here?

65
00:08:45,412 --> 00:08:47,300
This far south?

66
00:08:47,964 --> 00:08:50,910
I'd like a canteen of water

67
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:52,701
What for?

68
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:55,057
Do you ask everyone the same thing?

69
00:08:55,517 --> 00:09:00,216
Only if it's a Northern soldier
trying to sneak into Texas as a spy.

70
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:02,356
I am from Texas.

71
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:04,258
In that uniform?

72
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:06,553
Better hold him.

73
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:20,434
Here, use these.

74
00:09:57,652 --> 00:10:00,155
They were after guns and ammunition.

75
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:14,902
Don't go to sleep
cos they'll be back. Here.

76
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:17,093
Where are you going, mister?

77
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:20,488
You're still aiming to hold me?

78
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:22,293
Yeah.

79
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:25,092
Till you get what you were after.

80
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:26,839
Thanks.

81
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:29,255
It's all clear, Sheriff.

82
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,996
I sent for the doctor.

83
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,657
I'd better get you something
to cover up that uniform
till you get where you're going.

84
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:39,632
Try this.

85
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,860
I have got people to talk to.

86
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:45,484
I'd like to get close enough
before they shoot.

87
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,073
Folks is sensitive to that colour
around here.

88
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:52,653
Say, just exactly what are you?

89
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,982
I guess you could say I'm a deserter.

90
00:10:56,017 --> 00:10:58,123
From which side?

91
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:01,396
Both, I suppose.

92
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,008
I'll get you that food and water.

93
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,660
Hey, Stellal

94
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:36,740
Stellal We've got company.

95
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:41,543
If he'll stay for dinner,
can we have peaches?

96
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:43,501
Maybe.

97
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:53,108
Go back to the house.

98
00:11:53,143 --> 00:11:55,102
Go on. Mind me!

99
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,780
Hi, Stella.

100
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:59,591
I thought you'd gone for good.

101
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:00,791
So did I.

102
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:02,193
But you couldn't stay away.

103
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:05,418
No, Stella. In fact, I deserted.

104
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:10,311
Well, you're late. I'm married.
You're not the only man in the world

105
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:11,820
Wait a minute...

106
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:14,944
Wait? Am I supposed to wait forever?

107
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:19,271
Let me tell you - one week
after you left, I got married.

108
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:23,564
To a good man, too. Ed Leathem.
That's his kid brother, Bax.

109
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:28,818
Two weeks ago there was a massacre
of Cheyenne at Sand Creek.

110
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:30,819
My regiment did it.

111
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:32,333
Now the Indians are on their way.

112
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:35,793
Indians. You made that up fast

113
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,633
Get off my land.

114
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:41,107
Stella, wait!

115
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:43,144
Your best chance is at the mission.

116
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:45,641
Damn Yankee!

117
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:48,809
Get her there, Bax.

118
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:51,209
Damn Yankee!

119
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,136
Hello, Miss Hannah.

120
00:13:09,273 --> 00:13:11,537
Don't you recognise me? Frank Hewitt.

121
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:14,074
I don't recognise no traitors.

122
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:16,464
The Comanches are on their way.

123
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:20,412
I figured you're
the strongest woman of them all.

124
00:13:20,624 --> 00:13:26,426
If you want to scare us off our land
so you can claim it, you're stupid.

125
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:30,038
I only want to help.
You'd better listen.

126
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:34,461
Listen? I've already listened
to three husbands in my time.

127
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:36,908
Maybe I'll listen to three more.

128
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:40,925
Now, you listen.
Our menfolk are fighting your kind.

129
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,869
We don't want what you call help
and I call lies.

130
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:48,977
Get going before you need patches
on them blue breeches.

131
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,625
Don't you dare, you dirty renegade!

132
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:22,987
No more trouble out of you, now.

133
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,361
Who are you? What's your name?

134
00:15:25,396 --> 00:15:27,143
Ann Martin.

135
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:30,706
Are you Jeff Martin's girl?
Where's your pa?

136
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:34,541
He's dead. You'd be dead too
if he taught me how to shoot.

137
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:37,055
I'm not here to do you any harm.

138
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:42,926
Indians are on the warpath.
I want you to get to the mission
as fast as you can.

139
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:46,537
I'm sorry about your pa.

140
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:54,080
Now, you start running.

141
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:56,903
Ann, your father and I were friends.

142
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:04,074
If you're pig-headed enough
to stay here and get slaughtered,

143
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:06,547
there's nothing I can do about it.

144
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:10,269
Keep moving, Yankee.

145
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,840
I was a horse's hindsight
for ever coming here.

146
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,403
You get!

147
00:16:56,429 --> 00:17:00,684
Mr Turncoat, I guess
I didn't talk very clear last time.

148
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:03,530
Nor did I. So maybe this will help.

149
00:17:07,274 --> 00:17:09,219
Dora Hartley.

150
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:12,375
The way the Comanches left her.

151
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:15,562
That's an ugly way of telling things

152
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:19,610
You wouldn't listen to me.
You had to be shown.

153
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:23,658
There are things to do. Let's go.

154
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:45,868
Most merciful Father, who has
been pleased to take unto Thyself

155
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:49,810
the soul of this,
thy servant, Dora Hartley,

156
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:55,159
grant unto us,
who are still in our pilgrimage,

157
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:57,863
who walk as yet by faith,

158
00:18:01,506 --> 00:18:07,524
that we may join Thy blessed saints
hereafter in glory everlasting.

159
00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:13,097
# Now all my money's spent and gone

160
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:23,606
# You pass by my door,
a singer, a song

161
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:29,284
# Now all my money's spent and gone#

162
00:18:30,386 --> 00:18:31,888
Good afternoon.

163
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:33,390
How do you do?

164
00:18:33,604 --> 00:18:37,916
La-di-dah. I thought
all the real men were away fightin'.

165
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,012
Are you ladies from around here?

166
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:44,789
Certainly not. I'm Mrs Charlotte
Ogden of the Charleston Ogdens.

167
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:49,852
The first thing I wish to make clear
is that I am not with this... this...

168
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,761
Er, creature?

169
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:53,397
Thank you.

170
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:58,040
Our driver left two days ago to
find a new wagon when we broke down.

171
00:18:58,277 --> 00:19:00,563
I thought I should bring 'em here.

172
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,112
You did right.

173
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:06,687
Put a wheel on this vehicle,
and we shall be on our way.

174
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,514
That won't be possible.
We're expecting Indians.

175
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,127
Indians?

176
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:13,706
Men Indians?

177
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:16,223
You might as well alight.

178
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,153
Indians!

179
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:21,562
Indians!
Where's my rifle?

180
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:26,888
Get down over there!

181
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:44,131
You should have seen yourselves.

182
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,179
You, too, yellow-liv...

183
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:51,530
Stand easy, son.

184
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:54,511
What's wrong? Can't take a joke?

185
00:19:54,546 --> 00:19:56,245
Not when it isn't funny.

186
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,507
I thought you should hear the sound
of the only Indian within 100 miles.

187
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:04,109
Or maybe you believe your tall tale.

188
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:07,227
If Dora Hartley could speak
from the grave, she'd tell you.

189
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:10,784
She was killed by a stray.

190
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:12,746
What if you're wrong?

191
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:17,776
If he's right, we should run so fast
the wind would knock over the trees.

192
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:24,465
By the time you ladies
made up your minds, the Comanches
could have closed off the valley.

193
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,599
Two days ago would've been different.

194
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:30,698
We're asking about today
and tomorrow.

195
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,092
I say we stay here. All of us.

196
00:20:34,306 --> 00:20:36,695
How many ladies know how to shoot?

197
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,838
You can put your hand up.

198
00:20:43,873 --> 00:20:46,341
I can shoot good, damn Yankee.

199
00:20:46,764 --> 00:20:48,376
Mr Hewitt.

200
00:20:48,411 --> 00:20:52,040
Only the Good Book tells me
what is right to do.

201
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:54,420
I don't believe in killing.

202
00:20:55,293 --> 00:21:00,333
Miss Cora, the Comanches won't be
reading it through their rifle sights

203
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:05,424
Miss Hannah, I appoint you
sergeant and second-in-command.

204
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:07,683
Pick a couple of corporals.

205
00:21:07,718 --> 00:21:09,868
Ann Martin and Stella Leathem.

206
00:21:09,903 --> 00:21:14,351
Good. Now, get those horses unhitched
and put them in the corral.

207
00:21:14,386 --> 00:21:16,287
Get your things inside the mission.

208
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,742
I sure wish you troopers luck.

209
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:22,428
Cos you're sure gonna need it.

210
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:28,870
Going somewhere, Kettle?

211
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:37,541
Maybe you do need a man around here.

212
00:21:37,576 --> 00:21:40,388
One you're sure is on your side.

213
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:42,291
At least I chose a side.

214
00:21:42,326 --> 00:21:44,405
Let's get to work.

215
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,485
You heard the man.

216
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:51,673
Emmett, I'm glad you're here.

217
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,922
Yeah, Mary... Yeah.

218
00:21:56,214 --> 00:22:00,162
All right, men, use your muscles.
Turn it over.

219
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,345
In there. Push.

220
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,313
Push!

221
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:15,784
All right, Lieutenant, all right.

222
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:17,710
Ready, men?

223
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:20,725
One, two, three...

224
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,580
Heave!

225
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,342
Any three men, Lieutenant.

226
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:30,008
Yeah, well. Target practice.

227
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,603
Good.

228
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:38,582
Hold it, hold it.

229
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:42,383
Get your head down
so you can see that front sight.

230
00:22:48,211 --> 00:22:49,929
That's fine, Hetty.

231
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:56,587
Are you all right?

232
00:22:57,351 --> 00:23:02,391
You won't hit anything, but you'll
sure as blazes scare them to death.

233
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,280
If I remember correctly,
you don't need much practice.

234
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,901
I'll take my gun back
if you don't mind.

235
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:29,736
Better than any three men,
Lieutenant, any three men.

236
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,103
Most any three men.

237
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:46,140
Hurry up, hurry up!

238
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,747
Prepare to move out, Sergeant.

239
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,922
Skirts!

240
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,218
Up!

241
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,945
Tuck them in! Tuck them in!

242
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,178
Ready!

243
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:08,450
Charge!

244
00:24:13,698 --> 00:24:18,294
You're supposed to be doing
a skirmish, not dancing a polka.

245
00:24:20,055 --> 00:24:22,228
Heckles, get down.

246
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,793
The back of your lap
is a hard place to tie a bandage.

247
00:24:26,828 --> 00:24:31,424
This time I want you to hit that
ground so hard it splits wide open.

248
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,386
Oh.

249
00:24:33,595 --> 00:24:37,215
General, this ain't
the kinda work I'm accustomed to.

250
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,596
Can't you think of a more pleasing
arrangement for the both of us?

251
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:43,558
Fall in!

252
00:24:44,757 --> 00:24:46,850
On the double!

253
00:24:56,898 --> 00:25:00,504
You've got to
brace your feet, girls. Next!

254
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,326
Hold it! Hold it.

255
00:25:05,782 --> 00:25:08,273
That's not the way I showed you.

256
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,820
Get over there, Martin.

257
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:13,423
You've got to use their momentum.

258
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,820
All right. Fast.

259
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:20,208
You see?

260
00:25:21,183 --> 00:25:23,834
# We've been working all day long

261
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:26,324
# We've been working all day long

262
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,709
# We've been working all day long

263
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:31,030
# Passing the water, darling

264
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:33,980
# Pass the bucket down the line

265
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:36,696
# Pass the bucket down the line...

266
00:25:36,731 --> 00:25:38,910
Start on that one over there.

267
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,796
If Indians don't attack at night,
why can't we bring water in there?

268
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:46,485
Because they'll be needing water.

269
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,089
Sounds reasonable.

270
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,904
# Passing the water, darling

271
00:25:50,939 --> 00:25:53,669
# We've been working all day long

272
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:56,084
# We've been working... #

273
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:03,772
It's no wonder. We're not slaves.
You've no right to work us to death.

274
00:26:03,807 --> 00:26:05,305
Hetty, my smelling salts.

275
00:26:05,638 --> 00:26:07,625
Keep that water moving.

276
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,457
How dare you talk to me like that.

277
00:26:09,887 --> 00:26:12,026
Move!

278
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:15,897
You'd better rest for a while.

279
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:19,708
Sit here.

280
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:23,839
You'll be all right.
Just a little touch of sun.

281
00:26:34,263 --> 00:26:36,404
Emmett, you've got to help me.

282
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:38,545
Let's not start that again.

283
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:42,707
I can't stand it any longer.
I think I'm losing my mind.

284
00:26:42,742 --> 00:26:43,668
You haven't told the others?

285
00:26:44,025 --> 00:26:46,994
No, but it won't take long to guess.

286
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:49,210
Oh, Emmett, please marry me.

287
00:26:49,245 --> 00:26:53,397
Look, I... told you.
I'm not ready for marriage yet.

288
00:26:53,627 --> 00:26:55,834
Get inside or back behind the wall.

289
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:59,179
Behind the wall, men.

290
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:02,021
Now, get down.

291
00:27:02,056 --> 00:27:03,448
Get down!

292
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:19,196
Let's get to work.
Throw all these pieces down the hole!

293
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:25,880
It's about ready.

294
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:38,662
There's a saying
that an army travels on its stomach.

295
00:27:38,697 --> 00:27:42,515
I'm glad we're not going anywhere.
More salt.

296
00:27:44,283 --> 00:27:47,104
Don't waste that lead, it's scarce.

297
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,631
Don't reload these with rough edges.

298
00:28:03,838 --> 00:28:08,047
What's wrong with your petticoat,
Ogden? We need bandages.

299
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:10,400
I had Hetty give up hers.

300
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:12,585
Take it off.

301
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,471
What?

302
00:28:13,495 --> 00:28:14,587
Take it off right now.

303
00:28:14,622 --> 00:28:16,754
How dare you?

304
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:18,677
Take it off, or I'll do it for you.

305
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:21,107
H-h-hetty?

306
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:26,250
If you were in South Carolina, sir,
you would be horsewhipped.

307
00:28:31,856 --> 00:28:34,938
Let me introduce a lady, la-di-dah.

308
00:28:34,973 --> 00:28:40,789
La-di-dah, a lady
with a very pompous air, la-di-dah.

309
00:28:40,824 --> 00:28:45,204
# She can't see you pass her by
Cos her nose is in the sky

310
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:49,004
# Her boots are fancy leather
And her bonnet... #

311
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:51,962
We needed the petticoat.

312
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,242
La-di-dah.

313
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,425
Hi, Stell.
- Can I talk to you?

314
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,774
Sure.

315
00:29:01,684 --> 00:29:05,199
What do you really think
our chances are?

316
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,476
With Indians it's hard to tell.

317
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:11,861
I know what this can be.

318
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:16,539
Frank, I said I got married
a week after you went away.

319
00:29:16,574 --> 00:29:18,645
Ask me why.

320
00:29:18,995 --> 00:29:21,200
You said Ed Leathem's a good man.

321
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,011
He is.

322
00:29:23,236 --> 00:29:25,426
But ask me if I love him.

323
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:27,616
That's not a fit question.

324
00:29:28,187 --> 00:29:31,111
I married him out of hurt and spite.

325
00:29:31,348 --> 00:29:32,500
I don't blame you.

326
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:35,144
I went crazy at what you'd done.

327
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:38,273
Don't say something
you'll regret later.

328
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:41,564
I'm so glad I can say it at last

329
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,339
In my heart I've never been his wife

330
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:48,438
When I saw you come riding in,
it was like a dam bursting.

331
00:29:48,473 --> 00:29:50,804
It let all my feelings loose.

332
00:29:51,475 --> 00:29:53,351
Hey, Stella! Stella!

333
00:29:53,386 --> 00:29:55,190
What is it, Bax?

334
00:29:55,225 --> 00:29:56,829
Sergeant Hannah needs you.

335
00:29:57,198 --> 00:29:58,200
I'll be there in a minute.

336
00:29:58,256 --> 00:30:01,202
She wants you right away.

337
00:30:04,924 --> 00:30:07,916
I made that up to make her go.

338
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:09,261
Now, mister.

339
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,700
Careful where you point that gun.

340
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,857
I'm pointing it at a no-good Yankee.

341
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,467
Shouldn't we forget about the war?

342
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:21,759
My brother told me to look after her

343
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,588
You're doing a good job.
We were just talking about Ed.

344
00:30:25,817 --> 00:30:27,990
Out here? Like that?

345
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:30,600
Bax, can you keep a man's secret?

346
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:32,000
Depends.

347
00:30:32,072 --> 00:30:34,572
You've got things mixed up.

348
00:30:34,607 --> 00:30:37,073
See, I already have a girl.

349
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:38,700
Which one is she?

350
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:39,800
You'll find out

351
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:42,400
Which one?

352
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,165
Well...

353
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,971
There she is now.

354
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:52,810
Come back here!

355
00:30:55,216 --> 00:30:57,900
Hello.
- Hello, Bax.

356
00:30:59,294 --> 00:31:00,400
Ann Martin?

357
00:31:00,454 --> 00:31:02,980
That's right.

358
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,336
She's nice.

359
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:09,454
Yeah. You remember it's a secret.

360
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:10,718
Sure.

361
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:12,994
It's time you got to bed.

362
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:14,076
Good night.

363
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:16,783
Put that gun away.

364
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:26,718
Look, what makes him so sure that
Indians are between us and safety?

365
00:31:26,955 --> 00:31:29,389
Dora Hartley was pretty good proof.

366
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:33,736
Then why aren't we better off
trying to fight our way through

367
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:37,748
than waiting to be slaughtered
like a bunch of sheep?

368
00:31:37,783 --> 00:31:40,069
That's something to think about.

369
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,670
We can make it easy
if we travel light.

370
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:48,482
Load everyone in a couple of wagons,
stick two horses on behind,

371
00:31:48,517 --> 00:31:51,989
and when one team gives out,
change over.

372
00:31:52,024 --> 00:31:53,959
Simple?

373
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:42,125
Sergeant Lacey! Sergeant Lacey!

374
00:33:45,296 --> 00:33:48,811
The Lieutenant and Kettle -
they're fighting.

375
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,500
What happened, Hewitt?
- Deserter.

376
00:34:07,563 --> 00:34:10,227
And what are you?

377
00:34:10,262 --> 00:34:13,311
Hewitt drove off all the horses.

378
00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:15,630
Did you?
- Yes.

379
00:34:15,732 --> 00:34:16,350
Why?

380
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:21,193
He was afraid we'd leave
and tell where he was hiding.

381
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:23,000
I don't believe it.

382
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,501
It's partly true. I heard Kettle
trying to talk you into running away.

383
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:30,295
Sounded like you might.

384
00:34:30,631 --> 00:34:32,826
So you made up our minds for us.

385
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:33,901
Somebody had to.

386
00:34:34,145 --> 00:34:38,024
Without letting us
decide for ourselves.

387
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:42,079
But he kept one horse
for his own getaway.

388
00:34:42,318 --> 00:34:44,274
That was for scouting.

389
00:34:44,705 --> 00:34:45,800
Oh, sure.

390
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:47,700
A likely story.

391
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:48,869
Ha!

392
00:34:49,077 --> 00:34:51,200
Fine thing
to have to believe a turncoat.

393
00:34:51,227 --> 00:34:53,596
Just a minute!

394
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:55,781
Frank stayed with the rest of us.

395
00:34:56,175 --> 00:34:58,233
What about that varmint?

396
00:34:58,268 --> 00:34:59,656
Lock him up till the fighting starts.

397
00:35:00,121 --> 00:35:02,863
All right. Get goin'!

398
00:35:08,017 --> 00:35:09,757
Frank, look.

399
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,306
I'm afraid it's your place, Stella.

400
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:17,797
We can hope they head north.
But we'll be ready.

401
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:21,893
Right. Back to your posts, men.
Move along. Move along!

402
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:32,227
Sentry?

403
00:35:32,262 --> 00:35:33,945
All clear, Lieutenant.

404
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:35,890
Keep your eyes open.

405
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:41,358
What you're trying to do for us now
doesn't make up for the bad before.

406
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,423
What bad was that?

407
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:46,939
You ran out on Texas and the South.
How could you?

408
00:35:46,974 --> 00:35:49,615
I have to live with my conscience.

409
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,064
And it makes you turn traitor
against friends and neighbours?

410
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:56,960
You think your way, I'll think mine.

411
00:35:56,995 --> 00:35:59,624
Got all the guns clean, Lieutenant.

412
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:02,254
I'm glad you two didn't bust up.

413
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:03,568
Bust up?

414
00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:07,005
I've got the secret
about you being his girl.

415
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,731
Bax, see if the horses are all right.

416
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:12,117
You told him I was your girl?

417
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:14,290
Yeah, I... I had to.

418
00:36:14,325 --> 00:36:15,712
Why?

419
00:36:15,747 --> 00:36:18,796
He saw me with Stella
and jumped to a conclusion.

420
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:21,181
Stella Leathem?

421
00:36:21,216 --> 00:36:23,582
I'm glad I found out, too.

422
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:24,895
Oh, Ann.

423
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:29,678
Here's your water and candle.

424
00:36:29,713 --> 00:36:31,563
Wait, Mary, please!

425
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:38,127
Whatever happens, I want you to know
that I was wrong, so wrong.

426
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:40,530
No, I was wrong.

427
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:45,459
I guess maybe you were
to have anything to do with me.

428
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:47,100
I should never have believed...

429
00:36:47,168 --> 00:36:50,490
Listen to me, please. Listen.

430
00:36:50,703 --> 00:36:55,151
Before the war at the square dances,
men were so thick around you,

431
00:36:55,186 --> 00:36:59,744
a fella couldn't get near
without having his toes crushed.

432
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:04,842
Then the war came along, and all the
men in the valley left, except me.

433
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:09,297
I guess I...
I forgot how lucky I am.

434
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,597
What makes you remember now?

435
00:37:11,836 --> 00:37:13,300
Being here, waiting to die.

436
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:14,450
We deserve to die!

437
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:18,260
I do, but not you and the b...

438
00:37:18,295 --> 00:37:22,311
Oh, darling, we've got
something to live for now.

439
00:37:24,379 --> 00:37:25,300
Marriage?

440
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,900
Yes.

441
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:29,714
How? No-one here can.

442
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:36,200
I know, darling, I know,
but that horse will carry us
to where there is one who can.

443
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,931
Oh, Emmett. Could we?

444
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:42,343
Yes, darling.

445
00:37:43,313 --> 00:37:47,363
Oh, my darling, I...
I love you so much.

446
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,549
Oh...

447
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,135
The keys, darling. Unlock the door.

448
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:57,439
Hurry, darling. Hurry.

449
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:09,011
Conover and Gibbons, gardening time.

450
00:38:09,249 --> 00:38:11,763
Your daughter ought to be in bed.

451
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:14,264
Come on, honey.

452
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:19,582
I wonder what it's like
to have a kid.

453
00:38:19,617 --> 00:38:23,132
One way to find out -
marry and settle down.

454
00:38:23,361 --> 00:38:24,625
Me?

455
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,185
New country, new life. Why not?

456
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,541
Why not?

457
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:36,033
I knew a shoemaker once
who became a violinist.

458
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:41,396
Hell.

459
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:48,028
There's a good girl!

460
00:38:50,923 --> 00:38:53,642
Emmett? Emmett!

461
00:38:53,856 --> 00:38:57,804
Help me, please!
Come back! Come back!

462
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:15,300
Mary, what happened?

463
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:17,343
Oh, Emmett!

464
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:20,222
Kettle escaped. She tried to stop him

465
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,336
We'll take her.

466
00:39:22,371 --> 00:39:24,874
No!

467
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:26,991
Help me, Cora.

468
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:33,669
No. No.

469
00:39:40,689 --> 00:39:42,748
You lied for her.

470
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:47,663
One question -
why did you keep the horse here?

471
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,300
I could've led the Indians away
before they spotted the place.

472
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:55,336
They'd have caught you.

473
00:39:55,371 --> 00:39:57,193
Maybe.

474
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:27,694
Hello?

475
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:30,652
Hello?

476
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:35,481
Anyone here?

477
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:49,901
Amigo, set up three more.

478
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,821
Well, come on! Make it fast.

479
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:58,113
These mornings are terribly dry.

480
00:40:58,148 --> 00:41:00,407
Look, I'm no bartender.

481
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:04,274
I think you are.

482
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:07,710
We lost the other one.
Tortilla missed.

483
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:09,383
I do sometimes.

484
00:41:09,418 --> 00:41:11,563
Thank you.

485
00:41:12,229 --> 00:41:14,538
Amigo, how much money you got?

486
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,809
None, I haven't got any.

487
00:41:36,415 --> 00:41:38,360
It's pretty low.

488
00:41:44,176 --> 00:41:45,473
What are you gonna do?

489
00:41:47,976 --> 00:41:50,171
Come over here.

490
00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:55,067
What are you gonna do to me?
Leave me alone!

491
00:41:55,102 --> 00:41:57,606
Put your arms up!

492
00:42:01,207 --> 00:42:04,000
I got nothing...
All I want is to get outta here!

493
00:42:04,028 --> 00:42:06,426
We find out

494
00:42:06,461 --> 00:42:08,349
Let me get down, will ya?

495
00:42:11,622 --> 00:42:14,500
Get them up!
- He is a heavy one!

496
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:16,743
Let me get down!

497
00:42:16,989 --> 00:42:19,377
Now, there.

498
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:22,028
Tell me, how much money you got?

499
00:42:22,063 --> 00:42:24,083
None. I told you, none.

500
00:42:24,118 --> 00:42:28,191
Oh, amigo,
I must shoot you for lying.

501
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:30,335
I'm not lying, I'm not. I...

502
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,218
Look, my pockets are empty. Search.

503
00:42:34,253 --> 00:42:37,552
Then I'm gonna shoot you
for not having no money!

504
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,137
No, look...

505
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:44,632
Will you tell your boys to stop
this joke and cut me down?

506
00:42:45,723 --> 00:42:49,546
My friend,
we're in somewhat of a dilemma.

507
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:53,972
If you're lying, he has to shoot you.
If you have no money, he has to.

508
00:42:54,007 --> 00:42:56,564
Now, what's it gonna be?

509
00:42:58,953 --> 00:43:04,209
Look, supposing I... supposing I was
to tell you where there was gold.

510
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:06,800
Where's that?

511
00:43:06,858 --> 00:43:08,701
Cut me down.

512
00:43:14,462 --> 00:43:17,270
Why tell us and not keep it yourself?

513
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:22,186
I couldn't. There's a bunch of women
there, afraid of an Indian attack.

514
00:43:22,221 --> 00:43:25,144
They held me prisoner, I escaped.

515
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:28,067
They got jewels and gold there.

516
00:43:28,494 --> 00:43:30,246
Women?

517
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,906
Supposing there is no gold?

518
00:43:33,006 --> 00:43:33,850
There is!

519
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,397
There's still women.

520
00:43:36,611 --> 00:43:38,100
And also Indians.

521
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:42,163
So long as we're in this valley,
let's enjoy it.

522
00:43:42,395 --> 00:43:44,875
Unless he lies and there is no women

523
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,549
I'm not lying!

524
00:43:46,773 --> 00:43:49,025
Then we come back and complain.

525
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,830
Keep amigo here?

526
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:54,528
I'll wait. Look,
I want my share of the gold, too.

527
00:43:59,899 --> 00:44:02,413
That's fair enough.

528
00:44:05,484 --> 00:44:07,759
Are you sure you're not lying?

529
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:09,200
No.

530
00:44:09,257 --> 00:44:11,919
About the gold?

531
00:44:11,954 --> 00:44:12,682
No.

532
00:44:12,723 --> 00:44:14,729
Or the women?

533
00:44:14,764 --> 00:44:16,735
No, I... No.

534
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:19,355
I'm afraid I really must, old boy.

535
00:44:19,597 --> 00:44:23,283
Oh, no. No! Please! N...

536
00:44:23,512 --> 00:44:28,461
It's not good to have too many people
know about a hoard of gold. Or women.

537
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:38,391
Well, I hope his horse is good.
Mine's a bit lame.

538
00:44:59,723 --> 00:45:01,896
Sergeant Hannah! Sergeant Hannah!

539
00:45:03,206 --> 00:45:05,288
Yes?
Indians!

540
00:45:05,524 --> 00:45:07,515
Everybody to their posts!

541
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:10,427
Get the Lieutenant.

542
00:45:25,106 --> 00:45:27,165
Hurry, Indians!

543
00:45:32,537 --> 00:45:34,300
Is everybody at their posts?

544
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,200
Yes.

545
00:45:35,222 --> 00:45:38,430
Well, get to yours.

546
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:49,158
They're not Indians.
Maybe we've got some help.

547
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,942
They're white men.

548
00:45:55,841 --> 00:45:57,900
Well, open the door.

549
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:11,896
Well, welcome, men.

550
00:46:12,108 --> 00:46:17,045
You heard, boys. Looks like we're at
the right place at the right time.

551
00:46:17,259 --> 00:46:21,309
Correct. You're just in time
for a little Indian attack.

552
00:46:21,732 --> 00:46:23,193
Indians?

553
00:46:23,228 --> 00:46:25,890
That's a nasty word. Don't josh.

554
00:46:26,136 --> 00:46:30,698
It's no joke. Glad you're here.
We could sure use three more guns.

555
00:46:32,138 --> 00:46:36,029
Hey, where d'you get that horse?
Where's Kettle?

556
00:46:36,064 --> 00:46:38,218
He sent us in his place.

557
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:42,747
That's right, amigo. He say
you need help here pretty bad.

558
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:44,900
Three for one. That's...

559
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:49,740
We only interested in two things.
One's gold - where's it at?

560
00:46:49,775 --> 00:46:52,583
What are you talking about?

561
00:46:57,936 --> 00:46:59,915
Now, get!

562
00:47:13,384 --> 00:47:15,443
These are women?

563
00:47:15,677 --> 00:47:17,656
Get going, buster.

564
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:39,412
Frank!

565
00:47:42,391 --> 00:47:44,780
You'd better take him inside.

566
00:47:44,991 --> 00:47:48,825
All right, everybody.
Back to your posts.

567
00:47:58,229 --> 00:48:00,811
Them women can't get away with that!

568
00:48:00,846 --> 00:48:02,519
Tonight'll be different.

569
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,780
Look!

570
00:48:06,229 --> 00:48:08,390
Whoa!
Hyah!

571
00:48:58,282 --> 00:49:01,160
Peace! We don't mean no trouble.

572
00:49:01,195 --> 00:49:03,838
No, no. We like Indians.

573
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:05,700
One of you talk English?
- Me.

574
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:08,206
Tell your people we're friends.

575
00:49:08,241 --> 00:49:12,484
Si, amigos. My name is Tortilla.
I never hurt a fly.

576
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:14,793
It was not a fly.

577
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:16,536
We're poor men.

578
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:18,200
Honest

579
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:20,522
We know where there is gold.
And jewels...

580
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:23,250
Big, like a mountain.
- Gold only good for white man.

581
00:49:23,287 --> 00:49:29,204
Amigo, maybe you interested
in white women who brought the gold.

582
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:32,008
Ah, Chihuahua! Beautiful, every one.

583
00:49:32,043 --> 00:49:36,218
And a pony soldier.
Chivington. Chivington's man.

584
00:49:36,864 --> 00:49:38,422
Where?

585
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:42,117
The medicine man
is a man of his word? Yes? No?

586
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:43,877
Where?

587
00:49:43,912 --> 00:49:46,494
There. Back there. The mission.

588
00:49:46,937 --> 00:49:48,314
You lie.

589
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:54,128
No, amigo. To prove that
we are honest, we will stay here
and wait for you. Si?

590
00:49:54,163 --> 00:49:57,212
We are entitled to some of the gold.

591
00:49:57,448 --> 00:50:00,178
You honest, you come with us.

592
00:50:14,737 --> 00:50:16,910
They're headed toward us.

593
00:50:17,245 --> 00:50:18,250
Back to your posts.

594
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:22,808
Wait. We gotta gamble.
Get everybody on the roof.

595
00:50:22,843 --> 00:50:23,910
Roof?

596
00:50:23,913 --> 00:50:25,658
Move!

597
00:50:25,693 --> 00:50:27,404
Hurry up!

598
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:42,491
Everybody to the roof!
Everybody to the roof!

599
00:50:54,431 --> 00:50:56,820
Leave them open! Go up!

600
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:29,748
No-one moves or talks. One call could
decide whether we stay alive or not.

601
00:51:59,523 --> 00:52:01,582
Where people?

602
00:52:03,106 --> 00:52:06,621
Well, they gotta be there.
We seen them, didn't we?

603
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,465
Yeah.

604
00:52:57,565 --> 00:52:59,760
The Lord is my strength,

605
00:53:00,204 --> 00:53:02,058
my rock...

606
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:19,774
No women, no water.

607
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:24,378
But they got to be. They were
all around. We talked to them.

608
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:28,423
That's right.
They couldn't have just flew away.

609
00:53:34,454 --> 00:53:35,904
Chief! I know...

610
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:58,719
They're going away.

611
00:54:01,341 --> 00:54:05,687
We're safe. I knew if I prayed
there would be no killing.

612
00:54:05,722 --> 00:54:09,987
It didn't do those three any good.
Let's get below.

613
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:12,247
We sure fooled them.

614
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:18,832
Frank, what have I done?

615
00:54:19,401 --> 00:54:21,687
Coulda happened to anyone.

616
00:54:21,913 --> 00:54:23,983
Get to your posts.

617
00:54:24,222 --> 00:54:26,395
Bax, look after the children.

618
00:55:11,462 --> 00:55:13,931
You can shoot, get over there.

619
00:55:13,966 --> 00:55:18,460
That's an order. You will obey
if I have to drag you over there.

620
00:55:41,332 --> 00:55:43,334
What are they doing?

621
00:55:43,369 --> 00:55:47,214
He's gonna tell them
if the signs are in their favour.

622
00:56:04,048 --> 00:56:08,974
Mother of Moses, you can't get
any scareder than I am right now.

623
00:56:16,299 --> 00:56:21,441
Let them come into the yard before
you shoot. Don't waste any bullets.

624
00:56:30,628 --> 00:56:32,164
Now!

625
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,743
Get them.

626
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:01,150
Get down!

627
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:02,050
It doesn't matter.

628
00:57:02,055 --> 00:57:04,763
It does.

629
00:57:22,828 --> 00:57:24,887
Hold your fire!

630
00:57:30,376 --> 00:57:32,981
Martin, get those outposts in.

631
00:57:58,595 --> 00:58:01,217
Why weren't you firing that piece?

632
00:58:01,252 --> 00:58:06,201
The Lord was plain in His commands
about violence and bloodshed.

633
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:09,285
He also said "An eye for an eye."

634
00:58:16,634 --> 00:58:19,023
Go to the other side!

635
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:24,164
Get below!

636
00:58:30,723 --> 00:58:34,773
Martin, Lacey, see if you can
get some fire in there.

637
00:58:52,622 --> 00:58:54,783
Is she dead?

638
00:58:55,657 --> 00:59:00,583
She was guilty. She was stained
with the mark of sinners.

639
00:59:01,026 --> 00:59:02,880
Shut upl

640
00:59:05,305 --> 00:59:07,796
Come on, get her below, quick.

641
00:59:12,497 --> 00:59:13,816
Mary.

642
00:59:27,118 --> 00:59:31,282
Oh, what's the use of all this?
We can't beat them!

643
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:34,159
Let's just wait and die!

644
00:59:37,664 --> 00:59:39,529
Oh...

645
00:59:39,739 --> 00:59:44,711
What are you standing around for?
Did you think it would be a picnic?

646
00:59:44,746 --> 00:59:46,858
Sergeant, take care of her.

647
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:50,688
What's it look like out there,
Gibbons?

648
01:00:00,427 --> 01:00:02,383
Put her over there.

649
01:00:02,721 --> 01:00:05,781
Mama! Talk to me, Mama!

650
01:00:06,012 --> 01:00:08,287
Mama!
Oh, Mama.

651
01:00:09,069 --> 01:00:11,055
Mama.

652
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:13,509
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

653
01:00:13,544 --> 01:00:15,929
I wanna stay by Mama, please.

654
01:00:16,399 --> 01:00:21,386
I know, baby, but it's gonna be
all right. You come with Lucy, huh?

655
01:00:21,421 --> 01:00:26,373
I'll take care of you, I promise.
Everything's gonna be all right.

656
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:43,399
There's some things the army
doesn't teach, aren't there?

657
01:00:49,853 --> 01:00:55,428
Lucy, I... I wish to apologise for
the bad things I've said about you.

658
01:00:55,756 --> 01:00:59,920
And the... worse things
I've thought about you.

659
01:00:59,955 --> 01:01:01,447
Forget it.

660
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,871
I...

661
01:01:04,522 --> 01:01:06,581
Thank you.

662
01:01:06,815 --> 01:01:08,450
How many casualties?

663
01:01:08,487 --> 01:01:11,400
Two dead. Quite a few nicks.

664
01:01:12,186 --> 01:01:14,359
It could have been worse.

665
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:18,010
What happens now?

666
01:01:18,045 --> 01:01:23,597
We wait until the medicine man says
a prayer to decide when to attack.

667
01:01:23,632 --> 01:01:25,736
How will we know?

668
01:01:26,179 --> 01:01:28,238
It won't be any secret.

669
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,781
# Them golden slippers, gold

670
01:02:18,816 --> 01:02:22,877
# Golden slippers I'm gonna wear
because they look for me #

671
01:02:22,912 --> 01:02:26,105
Conover, we need what rest we can get

672
01:02:27,317 --> 01:02:32,448
Those drums are driving me crazy!
Frank! They're sneaking up on us!

673
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:51,370
Hold it! That's no attack.
They're coming to claim their dead.

674
01:02:53,324 --> 01:02:57,818
Sergeant, when they've gone, send
a detail to bury those renegades.

675
01:02:57,853 --> 01:02:58,801
Right.

676
01:03:00,106 --> 01:03:01,780
I'm sorry.

677
01:03:01,815 --> 01:03:03,419
You did right.

678
01:03:03,454 --> 01:03:05,581
How are you holding up?

679
01:03:06,672 --> 01:03:08,249
Just tired.

680
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,660
This may sound strange
after the way I acted,

681
01:03:11,695 --> 01:03:15,836
but when you're liable
to be sleeping for a long while,

682
01:03:15,871 --> 01:03:19,978
you want as much living as you can
in the time that's left.

683
01:03:20,013 --> 01:03:22,872
You're a good soldier. Get some rest.

684
01:03:22,907 --> 01:03:24,513
Thanks.

685
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:35,218
Frank. I want you to know, whatever
happens, I've learned one thing -

686
01:03:36,094 --> 01:03:40,258
life is meant for only one thing,
every minute of it.

687
01:03:40,466 --> 01:03:44,015
To love and to be loved,
that's all that counts.

688
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:47,295
Stella, listen...
- Please.

689
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:54,168
If we live, I'll tell my husband
that what never started
between us will never start

690
01:03:54,203 --> 01:03:57,093
And then I'm going home. And wait.

691
01:04:08,167 --> 01:04:10,340
Jones, take over here.

692
01:04:10,867 --> 01:04:13,300
You're on guard later.
Get some sleep.

693
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:16,487
Stop treating me like a child.

694
01:04:16,522 --> 01:04:17,874
I treat you all the same.

695
01:04:18,158 --> 01:04:19,096
Except Stella.

696
01:04:19,131 --> 01:04:20,035
That's crazy.

697
01:04:20,195 --> 01:04:25,215
No. If you can fool a boy like Bax,
if you can lie about me...

698
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:30,236
If you don't want to be treated
like a child, don't act like one.

699
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:43,149
Scared, Ann?

700
01:04:43,373 --> 01:04:45,238
We all are, you know.

701
01:04:45,273 --> 01:04:47,298
It's not that.

702
01:04:50,146 --> 01:04:51,465
Oh?

703
01:04:55,739 --> 01:04:58,560
What, then? The love bug bite you?

704
01:04:59,656 --> 01:05:01,521
No!

705
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:05,812
I don't know.

706
01:05:06,243 --> 01:05:08,643
I just don't know.

707
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:14,118
Oh, to be young and not know
the source of your troubles.

708
01:05:14,153 --> 01:05:17,455
He's a Yankee.
Yes, and he's a liar, too.

709
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:22,848
Hear, now. If you love him, you help
him. He's got nothing but troubles.

710
01:05:27,786 --> 01:05:30,198
Men, I want to talk to you.

711
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:35,218
He ought to be back in the army,
always shouting, shouting orders.

712
01:05:35,253 --> 01:05:40,047
His shouting doesn't fool me.
He's worrying himself sick for us.

713
01:05:40,082 --> 01:05:44,063
Trying not to show it.
That's why he's shouting.

714
01:05:45,507 --> 01:05:48,226
Good soldiers ought to know the truth

715
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:52,489
We can let them burn us out
or carry the fight to them.

716
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,116
You're leaving it up to us?

717
01:05:55,438 --> 01:06:01,718
Why? You don't tell us how to
nurse babies, so we don't tell you
how to fight Comanches.

718
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:02,659
That's right.

719
01:06:06,068 --> 01:06:07,500
What happened?

720
01:06:07,592 --> 01:06:10,776
Him! That medicine man.

721
01:06:10,811 --> 01:06:15,487
I got so mad at him for asking
his god about killing more of us,

722
01:06:15,522 --> 01:06:19,103
that I loaded up old Betsy
with five times her...

723
01:06:19,138 --> 01:06:21,362
Oh, look at her.

724
01:06:21,569 --> 01:06:24,970
Five times?
Hannah, he's more than a mile away.

725
01:06:25,005 --> 01:06:26,022
He is?

726
01:06:26,057 --> 01:06:31,893
Guns work for 300 yards at best They
keep the medicine man out of range.

727
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:36,784
I guess I figured I'd prove my god
was more powerful than his.

728
01:06:36,997 --> 01:06:40,933
Well, I guess
I was just hoping for a miracle.

729
01:06:44,193 --> 01:06:45,842
Let's see if we can fix up one.

730
01:06:46,192 --> 01:06:48,706
Yeah, I... Huh?

731
01:06:49,378 --> 01:06:51,209
Let's go.

732
01:07:05,459 --> 01:07:07,400
Sure you can hit these things?

733
01:07:07,484 --> 01:07:09,325
We'll hit 'em.

734
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:14,138
Don't forget everything I told you.
It's up to you now. I'm staying here.

735
01:07:14,173 --> 01:07:15,653
Are you trying to get killed?

736
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:17,913
Obey orders.

737
01:07:19,892 --> 01:07:23,043
All right, men. Back to the fort.

738
01:07:24,593 --> 01:07:26,652
That's enough.

739
01:07:43,957 --> 01:07:46,346
What's holding you up, Martin?

740
01:07:47,209 --> 01:07:52,511
Well, it's too bad to waste time
until maybe there isn't any more.

741
01:07:52,546 --> 01:07:54,762
Time for what?

742
01:07:55,327 --> 01:07:58,644
Hardly more than... maybe goodbye.

743
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:05,699
Or to apologise for the mean things
I said without having enough sense
to realise I'd regret them.

744
01:08:06,574 --> 01:08:10,408
With any luck,
I think we might have been friends.

745
01:08:11,518 --> 01:08:13,793
Maybe more than that.

746
01:09:22,396 --> 01:09:24,478
How does it look, Sergeant?

747
01:09:24,689 --> 01:09:27,078
They look upset about something.

748
01:09:27,507 --> 01:09:29,509
Good luck.
- Same to you.

749
01:09:54,968 --> 01:09:59,018
Now, put your sights on them bombs
and squeeze gently.

750
01:10:22,111 --> 01:10:24,156
Frank is running away!

751
01:10:24,191 --> 01:10:28,969
He's gone to do that miracle I tried
with that old musket last night.

752
01:10:29,004 --> 01:10:31,064
He's getting the medicine man.

753
01:10:35,328 --> 01:10:36,408
Fire!

754
01:10:54,266 --> 01:10:56,009
Did he make it?

755
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:58,285
Yes. Go with the other children.

756
01:10:58,651 --> 01:11:01,245
I'm the only man left to help fight.

757
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,517
No, Bax. Do as I tell you.

758
01:11:03,552 --> 01:11:08,148
No! You got no right to say no
after what I did.

759
01:11:09,245 --> 01:11:11,850
Here's a gun. Take that last window.

760
01:12:40,901 --> 01:12:42,857
Guard that window!

761
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:55,744
We make a great team, Hetty.

762
01:12:55,779 --> 01:12:56,974
Yes, ma'am, we sure do.

763
01:12:57,234 --> 01:12:59,919
I'll get some more ammunition.

764
01:13:07,687 --> 01:13:09,541
Hetty!

765
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:15,123
From now on, ma'am, you'll have to
do your own hair and dressing.

766
01:13:15,811 --> 01:13:17,961
And shooting, too.

767
01:13:25,076 --> 01:13:26,828
Look!

768
01:13:27,492 --> 01:13:30,427
You're making a mistake!

769
01:13:35,045 --> 01:13:37,764
Look! You're making a mistake!

770
01:13:37,999 --> 01:13:40,604
You're killing the wrong ones!

771
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:42,282
Shut up!

772
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,201
Bax! How are you? Oh, Bax!

773
01:13:51,777 --> 01:13:54,166
Cora, what are you doing?

774
01:13:59,432 --> 01:14:00,615
Let go!

775
01:14:01,734 --> 01:14:03,793
I'm gonna kill them!

776
01:14:04,029 --> 01:14:05,985
Ammunition.

777
01:14:09,929 --> 01:14:12,534
Go easy. We only have a little left.

778
01:14:13,435 --> 01:14:15,926
This thing is stuck.

779
01:15:15,988 --> 01:15:18,214
Ammunition! Ammunition!

780
01:15:18,249 --> 01:15:20,440
Ammunition over here.

781
01:15:33,173 --> 01:15:35,698
Drag him over to the front.

782
01:15:37,315 --> 01:15:41,684
When I throw this rope down,
tie it round his arms, someone.

783
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,047
There it is.

784
01:16:11,236 --> 01:16:13,613
Give me a hand with this rope.

785
01:16:16,258 --> 01:16:18,317
Open the doors!

786
01:16:25,882 --> 01:16:28,396
That's good, give me some slack.

787
01:16:35,053 --> 01:16:39,433
If superstitions run true to form
then this ought to do it.

788
01:16:59,577 --> 01:17:01,522
We whipped them!

789
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:06,990
Lieutenant, I got an apology.
You're a better man than I am!

790
01:17:12,668 --> 01:17:15,327
Ann?
- Yes?

791
01:17:15,362 --> 01:17:17,632
I have to go away for a while.

792
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:19,903
For how long, I don't know.

793
01:17:20,114 --> 01:17:25,154
I go remembering that, with any luck,
we might have been more than friends.

794
01:17:25,823 --> 01:17:27,600
Then why go?

795
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:29,610
I'm still a deserter.

796
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,705
I don't want to spend my life running

797
01:17:33,261 --> 01:17:35,547
Where's he going?

798
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:46,373
The defendant will
step forward and face the court.

799
01:17:51,972 --> 01:17:54,488
The court has weighed the evidence

800
01:17:54,523 --> 01:17:59,597
presented by the prosecution and
defence. The unanimous verdict...

801
01:17:59,632 --> 01:18:01,584
Ten-shun!

802
01:18:01,912 --> 01:18:03,915
At ease, gentlemen.

803
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:08,671
Don't let me interrupt, Colonel
Chivington. You're in charge.

804
01:18:10,316 --> 01:18:14,639
Lieutenant Hewitt is charged
with insubordination and desertion.

805
01:18:14,674 --> 01:18:16,367
Where did you apprehend him?

806
01:18:16,773 --> 01:18:18,558
He came back voluntarily

807
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:24,862
but with a wild story of
rallying a bunch of women in Texas
and fighting off Indians.

808
01:18:25,099 --> 01:18:26,350
That was no story.

809
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:29,240
The defendant will remain silent.

810
01:18:29,448 --> 01:18:33,930
Yellow Horse and Broken Foot
were brought in three days ago.

811
01:18:33,965 --> 01:18:36,082
They did admit to being in a fight.

812
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,100
One they'll never forget.

813
01:18:38,209 --> 01:18:42,374
With buffalo hunters,
not some petticoat brigade.

814
01:18:42,579 --> 01:18:46,094
Out of my way, sonny!
Up on your feet, everyone!

815
01:18:46,326 --> 01:18:47,300
What's all this?

816
01:18:47,372 --> 01:18:49,000
We've come for the Lieutenant.

817
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:52,322
Stand easy. This ain't no bugle.

818
01:18:52,536 --> 01:18:55,843
Colonel,
this is that phantom petticoat army.

819
01:18:55,878 --> 01:19:01,965
I'd like you to meet
Ogden, Conover, Sergeant Lacey,
Melavan and Corporal Martin.

820
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,658
Incidentally, six
of the best marksmen you ever saw.

821
01:19:05,883 --> 01:19:09,364
Now we've been introduced,
let's get out of here.

822
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:11,402
Hold it, Lacey.

823
01:19:11,437 --> 01:19:16,500
Look, men, I appreciate what you're
trying to do, but you'll get me hung.

824
01:19:16,727 --> 01:19:19,673
Clear out before I drive you out.

825
01:19:19,903 --> 01:19:21,124
Mr Colonel...

826
01:19:22,488 --> 01:19:26,333
if there's any driving to do,
we'll do it.

827
01:19:27,217 --> 01:19:29,720
Melavan, what's come over you?

828
01:19:30,052 --> 01:19:35,957
The Lord told me that
if something's worth fighting for,
a body'd better fight.

829
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:39,777
Sergeant Lebbard,
have the bugler sound assembly.

830
01:19:42,642 --> 01:19:44,900
Can't we have a truce?
- That depends.

831
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:47,858
The South has counterattacked.

832
01:19:47,893 --> 01:19:50,719
We've lost this engagement.

833
01:19:53,559 --> 01:19:58,496
The reports I have received prove
that the wrong man has been on trial

834
01:19:58,531 --> 01:20:00,685
The evidence is overwhelming,

835
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,757
and some of it downright attractive.

836
01:20:03,792 --> 01:20:05,990
Oh, thank you.

837
01:20:06,025 --> 01:20:13,693
Lieutenant, we will need you
at the trial of Colonel Chivington
for the Sand Creek massacre.

838
01:20:13,901 --> 01:20:18,850
Stella took your advice and stayed
behind to wait for her husband.

839
01:20:18,885 --> 01:20:22,335
Lieutenant, thank you
and God bless you.

840
01:20:26,841 --> 01:20:28,889
That was for the slap, Frank.

841
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:30,814
I made a good trade.

842
01:20:31,074 --> 01:20:32,250
Thanks again.

843
01:20:32,291 --> 01:20:34,282
Congratulations.

844
01:20:34,317 --> 01:20:36,442
Thank you.

845
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:41,131
I'll never get used to you
without gun smoke on your face.

846
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:43,102
You'd better try, renegade.

847
01:20:43,137 --> 01:20:45,038
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

848
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:46,287
Thank you, Nancy.

849
01:20:46,527 --> 01:20:51,601
Ogden and I are gonna raise Nancy
to be a real lady, to square things.

850
01:20:51,636 --> 01:20:55,241
I think that'll square
a lot of things. Good luck.

851
01:20:55,276 --> 01:20:57,444
And good luck to you, too.
