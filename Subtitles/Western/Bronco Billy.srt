1
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:12,927
Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,405
...boys and girls...

3
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:17,000
...we welcome you this evening...

4
00:03:17,076 --> 00:03:20,273
...to the greatest, the most authentic...

5
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:23,041
...Wild West Show in America!

6
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:24,977
So hang on...

7
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:27,110
...to your hats and boots...

8
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:30,853
...or your loved one's hand.

9
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:36,092
Let us take you back to a time...

10
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:40,063
...when the cowboys and Indians
roamed our great land!

11
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:44,330
And now, for our first act this evening...

12
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:46,304
...Chief Big Eagle...

13
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:52,208
...the great-great grandson of
the great Apache Indian chief, Geronimo...

14
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:56,879
...will perform his legendary
Rattlesnake Dance...

15
00:03:57,216 --> 00:04:00,879
...that no white man has ever seen before!

16
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,610
And that's for sure!

17
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:04,513
Chief Big Eagle!

18
00:04:43,696 --> 00:04:46,062
I'm awful scared, Bronco Billy.

19
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:49,660
Everybody's a little nervous
their first night in show business.

20
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:53,171
You just do what we rehearsed
and everything will be fine.

21
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:56,140
Yeah, but I'm awful scared, Bronco Billy.

22
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,744
Take a swig of this,
it'll make you feel great.

23
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:06,879
The Chief got bit again by the rattlesnake.

24
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:07,977
Damn!

25
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:12,122
Running Water took him to their truck
and gave him a shot of Doc's Snake Bite.

26
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:16,059
I don't know why he can't just do
the Great Apache Flaming Arrow Act.

27
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:18,422
Didn't you tell him
to use the gopher snake?

28
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:21,026
I did, but he's a proud Indian.

29
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,068
The only good Indian is a dead Indian.

30
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,260
Let's go, girl.

31
00:06:10,116 --> 00:06:11,083
How about it?

32
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,085
How about a big hand
for Lasso Leonard James?

33
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:17,479
The greatest rope artist in the West!

34
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:22,918
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

35
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:25,896
...it is my privilege and honor...

36
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:28,066
...to present to you this evening...

37
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:30,566
...the greatest trick shooter...

38
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:34,667
...the fastest draw...

39
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,367
...the toughest hombre...

40
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:43,772
...the one and only Bronco Billy McCoy!

41
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,168
How about it?

42
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:10,958
Terrific!

43
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:19,274
Thank you, folks.
Thank you, my little pardners out there.

44
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:23,144
Always great to be back in Montana
and see all of our friends.

45
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:26,849
Now I'd like to introduce you
to my new assistant.

46
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:28,954
It's her first night in the big tent.

47
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:32,821
So how about a big Montana welcome
for Miss Mitzi Fritts.

48
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,057
Throw up the plates.

49
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,012
Throw up another plate.

50
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:15,800
How about it, ladies and gentlemen?
Bronco Billy!

51
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:26,635
And now I want all of you settlers...

52
00:09:27,012 --> 00:09:28,877
...and all of you little pardners...

53
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:30,040
...to sit tight...

54
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:33,410
...because Bronco Billy
is getting ready to do...

55
00:09:33,652 --> 00:09:37,486
...his death-defying
"Wheel of Fortune" shootout!

56
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:41,925
Are those real bullets?

57
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:44,495
It's a special buckshot.
It doesn't go too far.

58
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:46,827
But don't worry, I never miss.

59
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,997
Miss Mitzi, would you like a blindfold?

60
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,168
No, Bronco Billy.

61
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:59,467
You're the best shot in the Old West.

62
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:02,312
Very well, but I will wear one.

63
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:09,883
Are you ready, Miss Mitzi?

64
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:11,917
Yes, Bronco Billy.

65
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:13,088
All right.

66
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:15,019
Spin the wheel.

67
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:06,267
How much money we got in the kitty?

68
00:11:06,345 --> 00:11:08,108
$19 and some change.

69
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:11,076
Nobody can ever say we're getting rich.

70
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,880
I'll just be glad when we get
to the next town.

71
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:16,080
That's good, too. But, I...

72
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:20,557
If something's sticking in your craw,
why don't you just spit it out?

73
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,192
Me and the boys have been with you
down the road through hell and high water.

74
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:27,755
If there's a fight, we stick together, right?

75
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,800
We know you've done the same for us.

76
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:32,133
Doc, if it's about that little gal...

77
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:35,670
...you know how hard it is
to find a good assistant nowadays.

78
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:38,232
You tell the boys that I'll find us an angel...

79
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,870
...who will make us proud
to have her in the show.

80
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:44,279
Heck, they understand
about all that, Billy, but...

81
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,415
What the hell are you talking about?

82
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:51,255
You know the boys love you and so do I...

83
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,586
...but unless we get paid, we have to quit
because it's been six months.

84
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:11,635
What's going on?

85
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,235
Get out of my truck,
you yellow-bellied sidewinders!

86
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:15,940
- It's raining!
- Get out!

87
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:21,546
What in tarnation is he
all heated up about?

88
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,817
I just told him we was all gonna quit
unless we got paid!

89
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,619
Why'd you tell him while it was raining?

90
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:29,793
Get out of my truck, you ingrates!

91
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:33,057
- Don't you swear at my wife, Boss!
- Get out of my truck!

92
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:39,228
We never should have elected you
to tell him in the first place!

93
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:43,731
What are you talking about?
We drew straws and I lost. Remember?

94
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:45,275
Yeah.

95
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,403
So it's money you want, huh?

96
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:51,715
I'm not gonna have a pack of wolves
snapping at my heels for money!

97
00:12:52,084 --> 00:12:56,214
You think when I look at the faces of those
little pardners smiling in the audience...

98
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:57,880
...I'm thinking about money?

99
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:02,550
All the good times we've been through,
and all the bad times...

100
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:07,891
...it breaks my heart to think that the only
reason you came with me was for money!

101
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:12,396
I thought I had the best bunch,
but I guess I've been dealt a crooked hand!

102
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:14,063
It ain't what you're thinking!

103
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,633
Nobody wants to quit the outfit.

104
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:21,837
I ain't had enough money to go into a bar
and buy a girl a drink in over a month!

105
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:23,142
You think I have?

106
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:26,442
You promised I'd have enough money
to buy a wooden hand this year!

107
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:30,614
You shouldn't have blowed that hand off!
I told you that shotgun act wouldn't work!

108
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:34,184
Running Water and I
want to buy a new bed.

109
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:36,159
We're tired of sleeping on straw.

110
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:40,460
You two would still be in the reservation
drinking bad whiskey if it wasn't for me.

111
00:13:40,532 --> 00:13:44,195
I'm sick of being on the wagon
and I'm sick of drinking plain water.

112
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:47,966
We all know what you used to do
for a drink and we forgive you for it.

113
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,272
If you want to go back to wool blankets
and dirty sheets, it's all right with me.

114
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:53,675
I need new ropes.

115
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:56,613
You young cowpunchers today
don't take care of your gear.

116
00:13:56,682 --> 00:14:00,413
I've told you a hundred times,
wrap your ropes after every show!

117
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:01,612
I know my job!

118
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,655
Then know it better! You hear?

119
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:07,448
Why don't we get back in the truck
and get on down the trail?

120
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:08,754
We're getting hungry!

121
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,556
I say we get it over, right now!

122
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:12,426
Nobody wants it over!

123
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:15,227
How about the rest of you?

124
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:18,870
You're right, Boss.

125
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:21,235
Running Water and I owe you our lives.

126
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:24,574
Where would I go?

127
00:14:24,643 --> 00:14:27,476
But soon as we get some money,
I'll get some ropes.

128
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,313
You're all gonna get what you want,
I promise you.

129
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:35,016
I save every dime, every nickel
that goes into that little tin box.

130
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:38,454
One day we'll get that ranch we want,
so city kids could come out...

131
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:42,093
...and see what cowboys and Indians
are really like.

132
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,122
Then we can all settle down.

133
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,488
You're the best bunch of wranglers
in America, don't you ever forget it.

134
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:51,365
You ride with Bronco Billy,
the fastest draw in the West.

135
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:54,005
Now let's hit the trail.

136
00:15:14,526 --> 00:15:16,357
I'll go get the permit.

137
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:19,054
You all go get something to eat.

138
00:15:25,237 --> 00:15:29,970
All right, Mr. Arlington, if you will both
sign right there and pay me $10...

139
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:34,445
...then you can go upstairs
to Judge Carbon's office and be married.

140
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:40,946
Darling...

141
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:54,190
Thank you.

142
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:03,004
Darling!

143
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:06,939
Don't walk so fast!

144
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:09,714
I shall walk as fast as I please.

145
00:16:11,316 --> 00:16:12,476
Light me.

146
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:15,415
Antoinette, darling...

147
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:17,913
...you know how much I love you.

148
00:16:18,123 --> 00:16:20,591
Please, John, let's not be maudlin.

149
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:22,623
But I do love you, my pet.

150
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:24,218
We need each other.

151
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:26,125
I need to marry someone...

152
00:16:26,498 --> 00:16:29,956
...anyone, before Saturday, when I reach
the disgusting age of 30...

153
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:33,835
...or I shall lose many wonderful
millions of dollars my daddy left me.

154
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:36,167
And you need my money.

155
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:38,937
I know you're as broke
as these vulgar Idaho farmers...

156
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:41,445
...so let's not talk about love...

157
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:44,977
...and get this thing over with
as painlessly as possible.

158
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:23,948
Is there an auto mechanic on duty?

159
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:26,684
- What's the problem?
- I believe my engine's burning up.

160
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:28,157
Pop the hood.

161
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,396
Just exactly how long
is this going to take?

162
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:42,231
There's a hole in your radiator
the size of a potato.

163
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,006
Repair it!

164
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:47,712
It won't be ready till tomorrow.

165
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:48,939
What?

166
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:53,113
Tomorrow?

167
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:57,151
Got to make a trip into town
to pick up a new radiator.

168
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:01,823
I'll pay you double what you normally get,
if you'll have it repaired by tonight.

169
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:04,021
I could sure use the extra money...

170
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:06,587
...but your car won' be ready till tomorrow.

171
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:10,702
Marvelous!
You and your rented limousines.

172
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:13,995
Why in the hell
did we get married in Idaho?

173
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,267
I thought Sun Valley would be
a good place for a honeymoon.

174
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:22,039
I just want to get back to New York!

175
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:23,914
You want her fixed?

176
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:29,311
Sometimes she makes me so mad,
I could kill her!

177
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:40,965
Stick 'em up or I'll plug you!

178
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:45,568
I ought to have the whole bunch of you
strung up for cattle-rustling!

179
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:48,037
We just wanted to talk to Bronco Billy.

180
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,504
All right, turn around, nice and easy!

181
00:18:55,914 --> 00:18:59,213
You little pards played hooky
from school just to come see me?

182
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:01,419
Look at his gun!

183
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,745
He really is Bronco Billy!

184
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:05,856
Put your hands down.

185
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:09,091
Are you really the fastest gun in the West?

186
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,862
Ain't nobody faster than Bronco Billy.

187
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:24,409
I don't take kindly
to kids playing hooky from school.

188
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:28,969
I think every kid in America should go
to school at least up to eighth grade.

189
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:32,539
But we don't go to school today.
It's Saturday.

190
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:38,488
I'd been riding late last night.

191
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,089
A man's brain gets kind of fuzzy
when he's been on the range.

192
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,388
I'll tell you what.

193
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:47,189
Because you're such good hearted,
little cowboys and cowgirls...

194
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:49,665
...and you say your prayers each night...

195
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:53,637
...I'll give you one free ticket each
to the greatest Wild West Show on Earth.

196
00:19:55,273 --> 00:19:58,436
I want you to bring your folks tonight, huh?

197
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:01,440
- Thanks!
- You're welcome.

198
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,342
Don't come late. You might not get a seat.

199
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:12,546
- Billy, where are you heading?
- I'm going into town.

200
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:17,250
I got to find a woman
who can shoot like Annie Oakley...

201
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:20,329
...ride like Belle Starr,
and who ain't afraid of nothing.

202
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,667
I hope you find one, but be careful.

203
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:53,228
Are you Bronco Billy?

204
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:54,890
I sure am, ma'am.

205
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,235
You sure got a neat car.

206
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:59,197
Woman, what's your name?

207
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:01,205
Dolores. Dolores Duke.

208
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,070
It's pleasure meeting you, Miss Dolores.

209
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:08,710
Would you like to go for a little ride,
when you get off work?

210
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:14,334
Jesus!

211
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,247
I'm certainly glad someone is enjoying
our honeymoon.

212
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:33,254
You, really should've come
to the Wild West Show, darling.

213
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,666
It was wonderfully corny.

214
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:41,635
You would've gotten a big laugh out of it.

215
00:22:53,018 --> 00:22:55,919
Turn out your light. I want to go to bed.

216
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,552
Yes, dear.

217
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:01,823
Aren't you...

218
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:05,830
...going to wash that stuff off your face?

219
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:09,794
I shall wash my face
when I want to wash my face.

220
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:19,334
Will you take your wet tongue
out of my ear?

221
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:24,174
- But I'm your husband.
- That doesn't give you license to maul me!

222
00:23:25,283 --> 00:23:27,080
You frigid spinster!

223
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:30,185
If you had any blood in your veins,
you'd know what to do!

224
00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:33,122
No wonder you've never gotten married.

225
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:37,527
Are you finished with your little speech?

226
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:40,227
Honey, I just want to make you happy.

227
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:45,124
But you frustrate me to no end.

228
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:47,531
Finished?

229
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,272
Yes.

230
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:54,436
If you ever lay a hand on me again,
without first asking my permission...

231
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:58,482
...I shall cut you out of my universe!
Starting at the bank!

232
00:23:59,484 --> 00:24:00,815
Yes, dear.

233
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:05,845
Darling.

234
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:10,324
May I put my hand on your breast?

235
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:12,327
No!

236
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:29,644
Wait here. I'm gonna go cash a $3 check.

237
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:30,840
All right.

238
00:24:35,086 --> 00:24:36,383
Watch yourself.

239
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:39,420
- Be back in a minute.
- Right.

240
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:55,896
Thank you, sir.

241
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,937
Cash a check here?

242
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,240
$3?

243
00:25:03,315 --> 00:25:06,773
Yeah. I'd like it in two singles
and four quarters.

244
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:10,148
No, wait a second,
make that two quarters and five dimes.

245
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:11,620
What's it gonna be, fella?

246
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,214
It's a stickup!

247
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:16,856
Everybody up against the wall!
You, too, Tex!

248
00:25:17,462 --> 00:25:18,486
- Tex?
- Move!

249
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:45,015
Do hurry, I want to take my bath.

250
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:49,951
I hope your rented limousine's
been repaired.

251
00:26:10,448 --> 00:26:11,915
Oh, my God!

252
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:15,415
Hello? I've been robbed!

253
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:16,886
<i>News Beat 7</i>, Mr. Bronco.

254
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:18,354
Bronco Billy's the name.

255
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:20,822
Me and my Wild West Show
are camped off of l-80.

256
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:23,189
When did you feel it was time
to take action?

257
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:26,057
It's always time to take action
when there's danger.

258
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:30,033
I want to invite you pardners to come
and see Bronco Billy's Wild West Show.

259
00:26:30,101 --> 00:26:31,568
Right off of l-80.

260
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:33,831
Here's Mr. Collarton, manager of the bank.

261
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:36,373
I want to shake your hand
and I want to thank you...

262
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:39,899
The first show is at 7:30 and I want you
to come and see Bronco Billy...

263
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:43,539
...the quickest draw, fastest shot,
quickest hombre this side of the Pecos.

264
00:26:43,615 --> 00:26:44,980
Right out off of l-80.

265
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:50,077
Hello!

266
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:13,074
How charming!

267
00:27:15,713 --> 00:27:16,941
Attendant!

268
00:27:17,148 --> 00:27:19,275
Attendant! You, there!

269
00:27:21,686 --> 00:27:23,711
Heard you the first time.

270
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:26,981
Did my husband,
the man in the limousine...

271
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:28,821
...did he say when he'd be back?

272
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:29,757
No.

273
00:27:30,728 --> 00:27:32,559
Could I use your telephone?

274
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:35,824
It's right outside there. It works on dimes.

275
00:27:36,134 --> 00:27:40,468
My husband seems to be playing
a little joke on me. He's taken my purse.

276
00:27:41,105 --> 00:27:42,629
Run off, has he?

277
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:47,075
Could you lend me a dime?
I just want to dial the operator.

278
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:48,076
No.

279
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:50,011
Why not?

280
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:51,981
'Cause I ain't got a dime.

281
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,408
But you have a telephone!

282
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,077
It works on dimes.

283
00:27:56,154 --> 00:28:00,056
Why don't you take a dime
out of your stupid little cash register...

284
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:03,855
...and let me use it to call the operator?
I'll give it right back to you.

285
00:28:04,896 --> 00:28:06,591
Ain't mine to give.

286
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,778
Nice looking, ain't she?

287
00:28:21,212 --> 00:28:24,340
At my age, that's about all I can do is look.

288
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,408
She live around here?

289
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,647
Her husband run off
and left her this morning.

290
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:36,487
The man's got to be a fool to run off
and leave something like that.

291
00:28:37,328 --> 00:28:38,920
Maybe, maybe not.

292
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:43,258
Sir, you have a good day.

293
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,429
Same to you, young feller.

294
00:28:48,806 --> 00:28:50,034
Good morning, ma'am.

295
00:28:50,174 --> 00:28:52,108
Can I be of service to you?

296
00:28:56,881 --> 00:28:57,939
Yes.

297
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:00,646
Would you be kind enough
to lend me a dime?

298
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:05,484
Sure. Come on across the street,
that's where I keep my money, in my truck.

299
00:29:09,494 --> 00:29:10,256
Coming?

300
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,837
My name is Bronco Billy McCoy.
And yours?

301
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,002
Bronco. What an amusing name.

302
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:27,200
My friends call me Billy.

303
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:29,412
Come and get it!

304
00:29:36,821 --> 00:29:38,652
Where's the dime you promised me?

305
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:41,283
- I wanted an orange soda.
- I wanted a strawberry.

306
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,690
Boys, this is...

307
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:43,919
Antoinette Lily.

308
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:45,860
Miss Antoinette Lily.

309
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:48,530
You're the prettiest assistant
the boss ever hired.

310
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:51,134
I sure hope you can ride better
than the last gal.

311
00:29:51,202 --> 00:29:52,931
Wait! Wait!

312
00:29:53,638 --> 00:29:56,368
Chief Big Eagle and his wife,
Lorraine Running Water.

313
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:57,965
Miss Antoinette Lily.

314
00:29:58,643 --> 00:30:01,874
All right, boys. We got to get moving.
Let's get to work.

315
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:05,479
What an honor.

316
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:07,749
The dime!

317
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:09,849
I wanted a Dr. Pepper.

318
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:12,420
Doc Lynch, this is Miss Antoinette Lily.

319
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:15,988
Welcome to Bronco Billy's
Wild West Show.

320
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,618
I hope you'll be happy with us.

321
00:30:17,695 --> 00:30:19,959
Quit chewing the fat,
we've got work to do.

322
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:21,760
We'll talk later, my dear.

323
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:22,992
Yeah.

324
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:26,827
You'll be paid a good wage
for an honest day's work.

325
00:30:26,904 --> 00:30:28,337
Room and board are free.

326
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:29,998
You promised me a dime!

327
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:31,040
Do you ride?

328
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:33,077
Ride? You mean a horse?

329
00:30:33,878 --> 00:30:36,904
This dime will be deducted
from your first week's salary.

330
00:30:36,981 --> 00:30:39,074
Now, go ahead and make your call.

331
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:42,286
We got to hit the trail.

332
00:30:47,525 --> 00:30:48,958
You sure are pretty.

333
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,476
Operator, thank God you're there!

334
00:31:06,544 --> 00:31:11,504
I'd like to place a collect call to New York.
Area code 212-966-7058.

335
00:31:11,582 --> 00:31:12,981
To Mrs. Irene Lily.

336
00:31:13,051 --> 00:31:15,952
- <i>Your name, please?</i>
- This is Antoinette Lily.

337
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:22,722
<i>I'm sorry, that line is busy.</i>
<i>Would you like to try later?</i>

338
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:24,019
Yes!

339
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:31,525
Damn you! Give me back my dime!

340
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:35,162
This isn't happening.

341
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:40,509
Would you drive me to the next town?

342
00:31:40,578 --> 00:31:42,443
Certainly, ma'am.

343
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:21,951
I tell you that John Arlington has murdered
my helpless little stepdaughter.

344
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:23,509
I never should've let them marry.

345
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:26,853
- What could you have done?
- Well, I am the family attorney.

346
00:32:26,924 --> 00:32:30,325
All of his wives seem to disappear
so mysteriously.

347
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:34,056
Now, don't go getting yourself upset.

348
00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:37,792
Edgar, what will become of me
if she has met her end?

349
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:40,236
If that is the case...

350
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:45,035
...you are next in line
for her departed father's fortune.

351
00:32:50,214 --> 00:32:53,012
I just want her back, safe in my arms.

352
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:58,281
But we both know Antoinette would
want me to carry on, chin up.

353
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:01,717
I'll call the police immediately.

354
00:33:03,694 --> 00:33:05,719
You're such a comfort.

355
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,339
"We're barroom buddies
and that's the best kind

356
00:33:24,448 --> 00:33:26,973
"Nobody fools with a buddy of mine

357
00:33:27,151 --> 00:33:30,484
"I laugh when you're happy
I cry when you're blue"

358
00:33:32,223 --> 00:33:34,453
Must you sing that disgusting music?

359
00:33:35,726 --> 00:33:38,251
Would you want to sing a duet
of <i>Barroom Buddies</i>?

360
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:41,594
No, I don't want to sing a duet
of <i>Barroom Buddies</i>.

361
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:44,130
If I'd know you were going
to the next town...

362
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:48,662
...instead of the one nearest the motel,
I would've never gotten into this vehicle.

363
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:52,438
It must be tough having the man you love
run off with another woman.

364
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,808
It'll be better now that you are
with the show.

365
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:57,074
My husband did not run off
with another woman.

366
00:33:57,148 --> 00:34:00,015
I have no intention of working
in your show.

367
00:34:00,284 --> 00:34:03,981
- Were you messing with another man?
- No, I wasn't messing with another man.

368
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:06,819
Furthermore, my life is not your concern!

369
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:08,318
You'll wake up Doc.

370
00:34:08,726 --> 00:34:10,591
Don't tell me what to do!

371
00:34:11,562 --> 00:34:13,757
I'm your boss and don't you forget it.

372
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:17,266
You are nothing but an illiterate cowboy.

373
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:26,776
Nobody ever talks that way
to Bronco Billy.

374
00:34:26,844 --> 00:34:28,471
Take your hands off me!

375
00:34:47,698 --> 00:34:50,565
You'd better get in.
It's a long way to the next town.

376
00:34:55,873 --> 00:34:57,340
What happened to Miss Lily?

377
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,069
I threw her out on the road.

378
00:35:01,512 --> 00:35:05,039
I'll have him thrown in jail
for the rest of his life for kidnapping!

379
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:07,482
Who does he think he is,
treating me this way?

380
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:10,850
He's Bronco Billy,
the best friend a man ever had...

381
00:35:10,922 --> 00:35:12,219
...besides his wife.

382
00:35:12,523 --> 00:35:16,550
Best friend? He hasn't understood
a word I've said to him all day!

383
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:20,360
The boss has a lot of responsibilities
running the show.

384
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:24,363
When do we get to the next village?

385
00:35:24,702 --> 00:35:27,170
Just try to get some shut eye Miss Lily.

386
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:32,467
How dare he put his hands on me!

387
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:36,172
Nobody says that about a cowboy!

388
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:10,308
Miss Lily, I thought you left us last night.

389
00:36:10,414 --> 00:36:12,473
Well, that lunatic tried to kill me.

390
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:15,417
He's a very good man once you know him.

391
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:16,644
Where are we?

392
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:21,283
We put on a lot of shows for orphanages
and hospitals throughout the country.

393
00:36:24,962 --> 00:36:26,429
Children! Children!

394
00:36:27,198 --> 00:36:30,292
Let's all have our lunch
and then we can thank Bronco Billy...

395
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:32,427
...for his Wild West Show.

396
00:36:33,804 --> 00:36:37,638
Billy, I hope you and your friends
will join us for lunch and prayer.

397
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:40,939
If you don't mind a few sinners
at the table, ma'am.

398
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:43,146
We'd love to, thank you.

399
00:36:43,547 --> 00:36:47,005
All right, boys, let's take a break,
have some chow.

400
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:54,157
I realize you ain't with the show, but...

401
00:36:54,825 --> 00:36:57,020
...you're welcome to have lunch with us.

402
00:37:14,645 --> 00:37:16,476
Would Bronco Billy give the prayer?

403
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:27,255
Lord, we ask You to forgive us
for our sins...

404
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:31,184
...and we want to thank you, Lord,
for the great chow...

405
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:33,526
...food that we're having here today.

406
00:37:34,031 --> 00:37:37,330
We ask You, Lord, to look after
these little cowboys and cowgirls...

407
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:41,360
...and show them the way to a good life,
so they don't get tangled up with...

408
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:43,430
...hard liquor and cigarettes.

409
00:37:45,342 --> 00:37:46,331
Amen.

410
00:37:52,783 --> 00:37:54,842
Sister, may I use your telephone?

411
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:58,286
I'm sorry, we don't have a telephone.
We can't afford one.

412
00:38:01,058 --> 00:38:05,495
Exactly how much do you pay Mr. Bronco
for this performance?

413
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:07,128
Pay?

414
00:38:07,364 --> 00:38:11,232
Billy and his friends come here every year.
They make the children happy...

415
00:38:11,335 --> 00:38:13,132
...but they don't get paid.

416
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:20,977
I said to One-Eyed Charlie,
this famous desperado:

417
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:23,809
"If you mess with me,
you should make peace with the Lord...

418
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:26,850
"...'cause I'm faster and tougher than you,
you dirty varmint."

419
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:29,317
What did he do to make you so mad,
Bronco Billy?

420
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,115
He talked dirty about my mother.

421
00:38:31,188 --> 00:38:32,849
So you killed One-Eyed Charlie?

422
00:38:32,923 --> 00:38:35,790
I didn't, but I shot his holsters
right off his hips.

423
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,227
You should never kill a man
unless it's absolutely necessary.

424
00:38:39,296 --> 00:38:41,491
May I speak with you for a moment?

425
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:44,023
Sure. See you in a little bit.

426
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:47,136
- Thanks for the show, Bronco Billy.
- You're welcome.

427
00:38:47,671 --> 00:38:50,606
You promised to take me to the next town.

428
00:38:53,177 --> 00:38:54,644
Tell you what I'll do.

429
00:38:54,778 --> 00:38:58,009
I'll take you to the next town
and you work the first show for me...

430
00:38:58,082 --> 00:39:01,540
...till I can get a replacement.
Then you're on your own. Deal?

431
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,587
Deal!

432
00:39:03,854 --> 00:39:06,823
Buster and I come riding in
after Doc announces me...

433
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:10,119
...then I ride around the arena here
doing my tricks.

434
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:14,792
When I announce you, you'll come out here
and walk up to this table.

435
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:17,929
Then, I'll nod my head
and you pick up two plates.

436
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:20,869
When I ride by you,
throw up the first plate...

437
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:24,834
...count to three and then throw up
the second plate. Got that?

438
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:28,840
I'll show you what it looks like
when the plates go off.

439
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:34,214
No problem.

440
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:37,282
It takes hours of practice
to learn to do that.

441
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:43,988
Mighty fine shooting, Miss Lily!

442
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:46,456
Beginner's luck.

443
00:39:46,697 --> 00:39:49,291
Where on earth did you learn
how to shoot like that?

444
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:54,462
Haven't you got something better to do
than hang around like a dog in heat?

445
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:56,703
As a matter of fact, I do.

446
00:39:56,807 --> 00:39:57,796
Excellent.

447
00:40:00,177 --> 00:40:03,146
You don't do the shooting around here,
I do that.

448
00:40:03,214 --> 00:40:04,203
All right.

449
00:40:04,548 --> 00:40:06,413
Now pretend I've done all my tricks.

450
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:09,744
I'll come back...

451
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,717
...I'll get on Buster...

452
00:40:13,457 --> 00:40:15,857
...and we ride around the arena.

453
00:40:17,494 --> 00:40:19,519
I'll come right around here.

454
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:23,897
I'll swing down and pick you up
and you slide right on in back of me.

455
00:40:24,401 --> 00:40:25,163
You what?

456
00:40:25,536 --> 00:40:28,664
You reach your arm out
and I lift you right up in back of me.

457
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:30,538
That's all I have to do?

458
00:40:30,774 --> 00:40:32,332
That's all you have to do.

459
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:34,543
What happens if I fall?

460
00:40:35,546 --> 00:40:36,342
Trust me.

461
00:40:36,413 --> 00:40:37,437
Trust?

462
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:42,081
If you can't get it right, we'll go over
and over it until you do get it right.

463
00:40:42,753 --> 00:40:43,742
No problem.

464
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:46,889
All right, here I come.

465
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,926
"No problem"?

466
00:41:01,438 --> 00:41:02,427
Hello, Eloise.

467
00:41:02,506 --> 00:41:05,532
- Mrs. Lily in?
- I'll tell her you are here.

468
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:08,907
- Mr. Lipton is here to see you, ma'am.
- Thank you, dear.

469
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:10,173
Edgar, darling.

470
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:13,717
The FBI has just arrested John Arlington
in Arizona.

471
00:41:13,784 --> 00:41:15,479
What was he doing in Arizona?

472
00:41:15,552 --> 00:41:19,682
I have a suspicion he was getting ready
to flee across the Mexican border.

473
00:41:20,357 --> 00:41:23,417
He was wearing several
of Antoinette's diamond bracelets.

474
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:27,521
They are formally charging him
with the murder of your step-daughter.

475
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:30,758
I'm going out there to see him.

476
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:32,426
Has he confessed?

477
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,573
At the time of his arrest he was suffering
from amoebic dysentery and...

478
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:39,709
...wasn't able to talk.

479
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:43,606
As soon as he confesses,
I want you to file a petition...

480
00:41:43,947 --> 00:41:46,848
...requesting me to be named benefactor
of the estate.

481
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:47,781
Of course.

482
00:41:47,851 --> 00:41:48,909
Eloise!

483
00:41:52,222 --> 00:41:55,885
I want to extend my deepest sympathy
in this hour of tragedy.

484
00:41:57,294 --> 00:41:59,489
That is sweet of you, Edgar.

485
00:42:09,506 --> 00:42:10,905
Just do what I told you.

486
00:42:10,974 --> 00:42:12,032
Simple.

487
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:17,844
Miss Lily, would you like a blindfold?

488
00:42:18,182 --> 00:42:19,843
Oh no, Bronco Billy.

489
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:23,453
For you most certainly are
the finest marksman in all the West.

490
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:28,751
Very well.

491
00:42:30,427 --> 00:42:31,792
But I will wear one.

492
00:42:31,862 --> 00:42:33,625
Must you, Bronco Billy?

493
00:42:42,373 --> 00:42:44,102
Are you ready, Miss Lily?

494
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:46,069
Yes, Bronco Billy.

495
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:49,069
Spin the wheel.

496
00:43:30,187 --> 00:43:33,384
Next time you change the dialogue
on that piece of paper...

497
00:43:33,457 --> 00:43:34,549
...you're fired!

498
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:35,887
How dare you come in here!

499
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:37,221
Where's that piece of paper?

500
00:43:37,294 --> 00:43:39,285
I'm not accustomed to being yelled at!

501
00:43:39,463 --> 00:43:41,294
Where's that piece of paper?

502
00:43:43,233 --> 00:43:44,222
There!

503
00:43:46,036 --> 00:43:49,062
I say, "Would you like a blindfold,
Miss Lily?"

504
00:43:49,273 --> 00:43:52,106
You say, "No, Bronco Billy,
because you're the best shot."

505
00:43:52,176 --> 00:43:53,837
Not, "the best marksman"!

506
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:56,379
And when I say, "I'll use one,"
where does it say:

507
00:43:56,447 --> 00:43:59,439
"Must you, Bronco Billy?"
It doesn't say that here, does it!

508
00:43:59,516 --> 00:44:00,244
No!

509
00:44:00,384 --> 00:44:02,818
Every assistant I've had
for the last 10 years...

510
00:44:02,886 --> 00:44:06,549
...has said exactly what's on this paper!
That's the way I want it continued!

511
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:07,715
Do you understand?

512
00:44:08,058 --> 00:44:10,185
And another thing, I own this tent!

513
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,751
Are you finished with your little speech?

514
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,956
Yes, I'm finished!

515
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:16,929
I do not work for you!

516
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,664
And if you ever raise your voice
to me again, I will scratch out your eyes!

517
00:44:24,408 --> 00:44:26,638
Are we camping here tonight
or moving on?

518
00:44:28,278 --> 00:44:30,508
We're hitting the trail, now!

519
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:34,107
He is a madman!

520
00:44:34,818 --> 00:44:35,842
Is he?

521
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:43,792
John Arlington, I am going to murder you
for doing this to me!

522
00:44:47,898 --> 00:44:49,695
How's Buster feeling?

523
00:44:51,435 --> 00:44:52,959
Kind of poorly, Doc.

524
00:44:53,036 --> 00:44:55,903
It's just his arthritis acting up again.

525
00:44:56,273 --> 00:44:59,106
I'll give him a couple of swigs
of my snakebite remedy.

526
00:44:59,176 --> 00:45:01,974
Just fix the old boy up, just like new.

527
00:45:03,247 --> 00:45:07,149
One of these days we'll get that ranch.
Old Buster can go out to pasture.

528
00:45:07,384 --> 00:45:11,081
Running Water was telling me
about the run in you had with Miss Lily.

529
00:45:13,056 --> 00:45:16,685
I say good riddance to that woman.
She just couldn't cut the bacon.

530
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:20,524
I'm glad she got out of the frying pan
before I wasted that much time on her.

531
00:45:20,597 --> 00:45:24,124
It's a shame, because I thought
she did pretty good for her first show.

532
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:25,699
She couldn't take orders.

533
00:45:25,769 --> 00:45:28,897
I gave her the piece of paper
and she couldn't memorize her words.

534
00:45:28,972 --> 00:45:31,372
But she was a damn good shot.

535
00:45:33,911 --> 00:45:36,141
I don't want to talk about her, ever again.

536
00:45:36,747 --> 00:45:38,044
Okay, you're the boss.

537
00:45:39,716 --> 00:45:43,379
She got her ride to the next town
and her breakfast on the house.

538
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:46,120
Mighty kind of you.

539
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:50,289
Her kind don't want to work.

540
00:45:53,564 --> 00:45:56,055
No wonder her husband ran off
and left her.

541
00:46:14,217 --> 00:46:15,582
Excuse me, miss.

542
00:46:27,898 --> 00:46:29,365
"Heiress murdered."

543
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:31,633
Can I see the Sports section?

544
00:46:34,071 --> 00:46:35,095
You may!

545
00:46:35,405 --> 00:46:36,531
Thank you.

546
00:46:37,074 --> 00:46:38,200
'Bye, ma'am.

547
00:46:40,444 --> 00:46:41,968
Goodbye, Miss Lily.

548
00:46:44,548 --> 00:46:47,039
It's too bad you can't come along with us.

549
00:46:47,951 --> 00:46:49,680
So long. Happy trails.

550
00:47:00,263 --> 00:47:02,731
You have a visitor from New York.

551
00:47:05,936 --> 00:47:06,925
Is it my wife?

552
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:12,066
Hello, Edgar.

553
00:47:15,112 --> 00:47:16,511
You've got five minutes.

554
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,343
You're looking well.

555
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:24,849
That's easy for you to say!
You don't have amoebic dysentery!

556
00:47:26,056 --> 00:47:30,152
I've known Antoinette
since she was just a little girl...

557
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:32,352
...and believe me, I don't blame you...

558
00:47:32,462 --> 00:47:33,952
...for murdering her.

559
00:47:35,065 --> 00:47:38,296
But I didn't murder that cold-blooded viper!

560
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:42,405
The sooner you confess,
the sooner we can all benefit.

561
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:43,469
Benefit?

562
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,499
I know how much you must have loved her
to have done such a thing.

563
00:47:48,111 --> 00:47:50,545
But the living must go on living.

564
00:47:50,614 --> 00:47:52,878
What has happened, has happened.

565
00:47:55,052 --> 00:47:57,816
I'm facing the electric chair...

566
00:47:57,888 --> 00:47:59,287
...or something...

567
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:02,917
...and you're standing here talking about
"the living must go on living"!

568
00:48:02,993 --> 00:48:04,688
I guarantee...

569
00:48:05,495 --> 00:48:07,986
...that if you plead temporary insanity...

570
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:12,090
...you won't spend more than three years
in a mental institution.

571
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:14,000
What are you getting at?

572
00:48:14,071 --> 00:48:16,596
If you confess to Antoinette's murder...

573
00:48:17,474 --> 00:48:20,602
...the day that you are released
from the institution...

574
00:48:20,811 --> 00:48:24,338
...you will receive half a million dollars.

575
00:48:36,326 --> 00:48:40,695
But what if they don't buy that
and I go to the electric chair anyway...

576
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:41,923
...or something?

577
00:48:41,998 --> 00:48:43,363
They will buy it.

578
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:45,999
I can arrange anything. You know that.

579
00:48:48,004 --> 00:48:51,565
But those mental institutions,
they're supposed to be maddening.

580
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:55,907
I know of some out here that have
tennis courts and swimming pools...

581
00:48:56,012 --> 00:48:58,981
...your own private room, color TV...

582
00:48:59,249 --> 00:49:00,614
...maid service.

583
00:49:03,386 --> 00:49:05,047
$500,000?

584
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,490
How much is that after taxes?

585
00:49:13,897 --> 00:49:17,663
Well, if you invest wisely,
you won't have to pay a dime.

586
00:49:21,938 --> 00:49:25,635
I didn't mean to kill her,
but she was driving me crazy.

587
00:49:34,084 --> 00:49:35,381
What are you doing here?

588
00:49:36,419 --> 00:49:38,444
You still need an assistant, don't you?

589
00:49:40,223 --> 00:49:42,589
I'm the head ramrod. I give the orders.

590
00:49:44,995 --> 00:49:46,394
Yes, Bronco Billy.

591
00:49:47,497 --> 00:49:48,964
Get out of this truck.

592
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,591
Why? Aren't we heading
down the old trail?

593
00:49:52,669 --> 00:49:56,400
You got to prove that you can work hard
before you ride with the head ramrod.

594
00:49:56,473 --> 00:49:57,963
I do, do I?

595
00:49:58,475 --> 00:50:00,272
Do you want the job or don't you?

596
00:50:21,531 --> 00:50:23,692
Is that your real name, Lefty?

597
00:50:24,634 --> 00:50:26,226
What's it to you?

598
00:50:27,537 --> 00:50:31,132
Well, I was just trying
to make time pass more quickly.

599
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:34,905
Why do you want
to make the time pass quickly?

600
00:50:35,979 --> 00:50:39,039
Because I find life rather boring.
Don't you?

601
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:40,516
Nope!

602
00:50:42,452 --> 00:50:45,819
Well, I can see we have very little
to talk about.

603
00:50:47,557 --> 00:50:48,956
I reckon not.

604
00:50:55,665 --> 00:50:56,825
Light me.

605
00:51:07,878 --> 00:51:11,245
Leonard, how long have you been
with Bronco Billy?

606
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:14,045
Must be going on nine years.

607
00:51:14,117 --> 00:51:15,414
Oh, please.

608
00:51:17,354 --> 00:51:20,755
Did your father teach you
your little lasso tricks?

609
00:51:22,092 --> 00:51:23,957
My father taught me nothing.

610
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:26,761
My father gave me nothing but whippings.

611
00:51:27,464 --> 00:51:30,661
Billy taught me everything I know.
He gave me a home.

612
00:51:31,801 --> 00:51:33,598
That's very touching.

613
00:51:37,007 --> 00:51:39,305
I don't know where you come from...

614
00:51:40,744 --> 00:51:44,737
...but they must not have given you
much love when you was a little girl.

615
00:52:25,855 --> 00:52:27,516
Well, it's good to be back.

616
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:28,818
I'm hungry!

617
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:32,988
You're always hungry. Let's set up
the big tent before we put on the feedbag.

618
00:52:33,163 --> 00:52:35,097
Big tent, let's get it.

619
00:52:35,732 --> 00:52:37,757
What would you like for me to do?

620
00:52:37,834 --> 00:52:39,529
You go help the boys.

621
00:52:39,602 --> 00:52:41,229
What are you going to do?

622
00:52:41,304 --> 00:52:43,033
I do the thinking around here.

623
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:44,664
I hadn't noticed!

624
00:52:48,745 --> 00:52:49,643
Chief...

625
00:52:50,213 --> 00:52:51,305
Excuse me.

626
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:53,275
Is everything all fixed up?

627
00:52:53,817 --> 00:52:56,183
We still have some patch work to do
on the tent.

628
00:52:56,252 --> 00:52:57,719
All right. Good.

629
00:52:59,356 --> 00:53:02,189
I don't want you to get bit
by those rattlesnakes anymore.

630
00:53:02,258 --> 00:53:06,319
Why don't you use the gopher snakes?
That's what I bought the damn things for.

631
00:53:06,496 --> 00:53:08,430
- Tell him. He'll understand.
- I hope so.

632
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:11,334
Tell me what?

633
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:18,332
Spit it out.
That's what I'm here for, is to help.

634
00:53:18,408 --> 00:53:20,535
Running Water's gonna have a baby.

635
00:53:25,081 --> 00:53:26,548
I'm gonna be an uncle?

636
00:53:26,616 --> 00:53:27,640
You ain't mad?

637
00:53:27,717 --> 00:53:30,652
Mad? That's the best news
I've ever heard!

638
00:53:31,087 --> 00:53:32,679
We know money's tight.

639
00:53:32,856 --> 00:53:37,316
We got to get a trailer for you
and some clothes for the little pard.

640
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,425
What's all the shooting about?

641
00:53:39,496 --> 00:53:42,329
Big Eagle and Running Water
are gonna have a baby.

642
00:53:48,905 --> 00:53:52,432
Why don't we get into our duds
and go into town and raise some hell?

643
00:55:00,577 --> 00:55:02,841
We plan to name the little critter Billy.

644
00:55:03,646 --> 00:55:05,409
Well, I'm really honored.

645
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:10,315
In fact, what we'll have to do is
get a raise for you when the critter's born.

646
00:55:10,386 --> 00:55:11,717
Thanks, Boss.

647
00:55:11,888 --> 00:55:15,255
Here's a toast to the fastest gun
in the West, Bronco Billy.

648
00:55:15,558 --> 00:55:16,684
Bottoms up.

649
00:55:21,197 --> 00:55:24,758
Miss Lily, why don't you put a little fire
between your legs and join in?

650
00:55:26,402 --> 00:55:28,996
I've matched you beer for beer all night.

651
00:55:30,473 --> 00:55:33,306
You're the coldest fish I've ever met!

652
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:35,935
How dare you call me a fish!

653
00:55:36,246 --> 00:55:39,044
"How dare you call me a fish!"
You are, you know!

654
00:55:39,449 --> 00:55:41,508
You don't know how to have fun.

655
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:44,119
You call your life fun?

656
00:55:45,822 --> 00:55:48,586
Your daddy should've taken a belt
to your backside...

657
00:55:48,658 --> 00:55:51,388
...when you were little
and you'd have had some respect.

658
00:55:52,095 --> 00:55:54,120
My father was a great man.

659
00:55:55,532 --> 00:55:58,000
He went to heaven when I was 9 years old.

660
00:55:58,468 --> 00:56:00,402
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

661
00:56:01,671 --> 00:56:06,233
Yes, there's a whole wide world
you don't know about, Mr. Bronco Billy.

662
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:12,240
Mr. Bronco Billy, I'll walk over to the bar
and introduce myself to that fine lady.

663
00:56:20,089 --> 00:56:22,023
People are such idiots.

664
00:56:24,494 --> 00:56:26,962
Go ahead, let the tears fall in that beer.

665
00:56:28,364 --> 00:56:31,094
- I'm not crying.
- Nothing's wrong with crying.

666
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:33,897
The smoke in here is hurting my eyes!

667
00:56:35,872 --> 00:56:39,239
Did you ever think what it would be like
to be nice to folks?

668
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:43,071
Folks just want to take.

669
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,675
Girl, you sure are mixed up.

670
00:56:48,718 --> 00:56:50,049
No, I'm not.

671
00:56:55,024 --> 00:56:57,492
Miss Lily, get up!

672
00:56:58,461 --> 00:56:59,393
Why?

673
00:56:59,529 --> 00:57:01,793
'Cause I want to dance with you,
that's why.

674
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:04,357
Dance?

675
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:05,727
Come on.

676
00:57:06,102 --> 00:57:09,162
Once you take the first step or two,
it's easy.

677
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:41,895
If you could only shoot straight.

678
00:57:43,373 --> 00:57:45,739
I can outshoot you any day of the week.

679
00:57:46,943 --> 00:57:48,706
You sure are pretty.

680
00:57:49,212 --> 00:57:52,375
I bet you say that to all the girls,
Bronco Billy.

681
00:57:54,884 --> 00:57:56,283
How dare you!

682
00:57:56,786 --> 00:57:58,515
Jesus, I only kissed you.

683
00:57:59,522 --> 00:58:00,546
Watch it, lady!

684
00:58:00,623 --> 00:58:02,147
Don't shove the lady.

685
00:58:57,213 --> 00:58:58,441
You stay out of this!

686
00:58:58,514 --> 00:59:01,711
We're family! We fight together!
We stick together!

687
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:08,718
- On second thought, I'll stick with you.
- Good idea.

688
00:59:22,438 --> 00:59:25,066
We're gonna take a five-minute break.

689
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:26,639
Don't go away.

690
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,151
Hey, pretty thing,
how about a little old drink?

691
00:59:42,258 --> 00:59:43,418
Get lost!
