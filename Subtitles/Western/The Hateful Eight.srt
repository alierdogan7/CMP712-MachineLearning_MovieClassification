a gopher hole in the snow,

406

fucked up his leg, had to put 'er down.

407

You got business in Red Rock?

Well, I ain't the sheriff yet.

back any of this up?

Yeah. When we get to Red Rock.

418

I figure you a bounty hunter
open for business.

420

And I figure you taking them three
dead bodies into Red Rock to get paid?

421

Three dead.

of Major Marquis?

00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,543
Ah, them hillbillies
went nigger head-hunting.

536
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,264
- O.B.: Get in!
- They just never did get 'em

537
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,546
the right nigger head, did they?

538
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,583
No, they didn't.

539
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,111

541
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,664

left their homes and families,

542
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,624
and come up this snowy mountain
looking for me and fortune.

543
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,549
O.B.: Ha! Get up!

544
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,264

Now, it didn't stay $30,000
the length of the war.

548

it dropped down to eight, then five.

550
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,028

551
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,791

of country boys coming to call.

557
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,905
well, the South took my continued existence

558

- as a personal affront.
- O.B.: Get up!

No, reb, I ain't never heard of it.

- Did you bust out?

565
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,185
Oh,

566
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,543
Major Marquis did more than bust out.

567
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,389
Major Marquis had a bright idea.

570

why nobody never thought about it before.

00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,710

spending overnight in the camp.

And I say, "Let 'em burn."

583

I'm supposed to apologize
for killing Johnny Reb?

584
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,465
You joined the war to keep niggers in chains.

585
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,463
I joined the war to kill

586
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,190
- white Southern crackers.
- O.B.: Ha! Get up!

587
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,348
And that means killing 'em any way I can.

588
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,628
- O.B.: Get in!
- Shoot 'em, stab 'em,

589
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,021
drown 'em, burn 'em,
drop a big ol' rock on their head.

590
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,744

white Southern crackers

- in the ground,
- O.B.: Get up!

592
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,504
...that's what I joined the war to do.

593
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,860
And that's what I did.

594
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,028
To answer your question, John Ruth,

595
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,071
when Major Marquis burned 47 men alive,

596
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,990
for no more reason than to give
a nigger a run for the trees,

597
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,306
that's when the South put a reward
on the head of Major Marquis.

598
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,184
- And I made them trees, Mannix.
- O.B.: Get in!

599
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,904
You best believe I ain't looked back
till I crossed the Northern line.

600
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,942
Oh, but you had a surprise waiting for
you on the Northern side, didn't you?

601
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,420
See, once they started pulling out
all them burnt bodies at Wellenbeck,

602
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,901
seems not all them boys were rebs.

603
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,425
Why, you burn up some of your
own boys, didn't you, Major?

604
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,907
How many burnt prisoners they end up finding?

605
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,420
Wasn't the final Yankee death
count something like 37?

606
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,905
- O.B.: Giddyup!
- (REINS CRACKING)

607
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,704
That's the thing about war, Mannix.

608

People die.

609
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,711
Oh.

610
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,903
So you gonna chalk it up
to "war is hell," huh?

611
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,461
Well, admittedly, that is
a hard argument to argue with.

612
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,469
But if memory serves,

613
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,948
your side didn't look at it that way.

614
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,461
I think they thought 37 white men

615
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,947
for one nigger

616
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,222
wasn't so hot a trade.

617
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,628
- I do believe they accused you
- O.B.: Giddyup!

618
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,026
...of being a kill-crazy nigger

619
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,222
who only joined the war to kill white folks,

620
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,147
and the whole blue and gray of it all
really didn't matter that much to you.

621
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,705
O.B.: Ha! Get up!

622
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,822
And that's why they drummed your black ass

623
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,341
out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down your back.

624
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,623
- O.B.: Get in!
- Isn't it, Major?

625
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,105
Horseshit!

626
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,665
If he'd have did all that, the cavalry

627
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,191
- would've shot him.
- O.B.: Get in!

628
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,790
Well, I didn't say they could prove it.

629
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,265
- O.B.: Get up!
- But they sure did

630
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,303
think it out loud, didn't they, Major?

631
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,263
O.B.: Hyah! Get up, boys!

632
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,031
But Warren's war record was stellar,

633
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,507
and that's what saved his ass.

634
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,781
O.B.: Hyah!

635
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,709
Now, you killed yourself your share

636
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:26,109
of redskins in your day,
didn't you, Black Major?

637
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,222
Cavalry tends to look kindly on that.

638
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,230
I'll tell you what the cavalry
didn't look kindly on.

639
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,555
- O.B.: Giddyup!
- Mannix's Marauders, that's what.

O.B.: Get in! Hyah!

641
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,862
And the fact that Erskine Mannix's little boy

642
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,869
would talk about anybody else's behavior

643
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,382

Well, no one said the job
was supposed to be easy.

so important to you?

cheatin' the hangman.

00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:01,788
For the sake of my analogy,
let's just assume that you did it.

880
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,028
Now, John Ruth wants
to take you back to Red Rock

881
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,063
to stand trial for murder.

882
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,309
And if you're found guilty,

883
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,063
the people of Red Rock
will hang you in the town square.

884
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,989
And, as the hangman,

885
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,309
I will perform the execution.

886
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,026
And if all those things

887
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,983
end up taking place,

888
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,104
that's what civilized society

889
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,542
calls justice.

890
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,549
However,

891
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,823
if the relatives and the loved ones

892
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:38,390
of the person you murdered
were outside that door right now,

893
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,821
and after busting down that door,

894
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,386
they drug you out into the snow

895
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,548
and hung you up by the neck,

896
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,028
that would be frontier justice.

897
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,064
Now, the good part

898
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,909
about frontier justice

899
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:57,661
is it's very thirst-quenching.

900
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:02,229
The bad part is
it's apt to be wrong as right.

901
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,671
Well, not in your case.

902
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,111
In your case, you'd have it coming.

903
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,383
But other people, maybe not so much.

904
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,510
OSWALDO: But ultimately, what's
the real difference between the two?

905
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:16,261
The real difference is me.

906
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,870
The hangman.

907
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,744
To me, it doesn't matter what you did.

908
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,101
When I hang you, I'll get no
satisfaction from your death.

909
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,301
It's my job.

910
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,865
I hang you in Red Rock.

911
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,704
I move on to the next town.

912
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:30,666
I hang someone else there.

913
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,910
The man who pulls the lever
that breaks your neck

914
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,910
will be a dispassionate man.

915
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:42,309
And that dispassion
is the very essence of justice.

916
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,220
For justice delivered without dispassion

917
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,982
is always in danger of not being justice.

918
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,511

00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,149
I am. John Ruth.

938

I'm bringing in this one to Red Rock to hang.

939

And ain't no way I'm spending
a couple of nights

940

under a roof with somebody
I don't know who they are,

941

and I don't know who you are.

942

So, who are you?

943
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,109

- That's my name.

945

Joe Gage.

946
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,429
Okay, Joe Gage.

947
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,269
Why you going to Red Rock?

948
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,422
I ain't, I ain't, I ain't going to Red Rock.

949
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,985
Where you going?

950
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,023
About nine miles outside of Red Rock.

951
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,227
What's there?

952
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,671
My mother.

953
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,066

Listen, I'm just a cowpuncher.

955
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:33,390
I just, uh, got back
from a long drive, and...

956
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:38,028
and I wasn't just an ass
in a saddle this time.

957
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,507
I was a partner.

958
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,420
First time in my life I made a pretty penny.

959
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,110
And, uh,

960
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:50,424
figured I'd come home
and spend time with my mother

961
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,264
for Christmas.

962
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,905

970
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,182
it's a wonderful thing.

971
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:26,107
Now, is that, uh,

972

1937
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:50,863
Everybody keep your mouths shut.

1938
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:52,590
Do like I say.

1939
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:56,582
You open your mouth, you gonna get a bullet.

1940
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:59,425
Move a little sudden, a little strange,

1941
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:01,781
you gonna get a bullet.

1942
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:04,141
Not a warnin', not a question.

1943
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:05,989
A bullet.

1944
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:08,421
You got that?

1945
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:09,991
Let me hear you say, "I got it!"

1946
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:11,386
- I got it.
- I got it.

1947
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:12,621
I got it.

1948
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:14,424
We have it.

1949
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:17,902
Chris Mannix, come over here on this side.

1950
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:20,905
Come on.

1951
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:28,148
Take this gun out my holster.

1952
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:40,943
(WHISPERING): Point it at them.

1953
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:44,263
Now, like I said,

1954
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:47,145
anybody does anything,

1955
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:49,581
and I mean anything,

1956
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:51,384
you kill 'em.

1957

(GUN CLICKS)

1958
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:56,944
So...

1959
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:58,949
you finally decided I'm tellin' the truth

1960
01:47:59,060 --> 01:48:01,108
about bein' the sheriff of Red Rock, huh?

1961
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:04,942
I don't know about all that.

1962
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:07,540
But I know you ain't the killer
poisoned that coffee,

1963
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:10,186
'cause you almost drunk it
your own damn self.

1964
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:11,870
One of them is.

1965
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:18,261
Aah!

1966
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:20,382
Ow!

1967
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:23,310
Give me the key. Give me the key!

01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:39,060
(YELLS) You motherfucking black bastard!

1969
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:43,861
You're gonna die on this mountain,
and I'm gonna fucking laugh when you do!

(GASPS)

1971
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:47,310
WARREN: What'd I say 'bout talkin'?

1972
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:48,501
(MUTTERING): Bastard.

1973
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:50,987
Meant it, didn't I?

1974
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:56,027
And you need to understand
you just killed the only man here

1975
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:59,269
committed to gettin' you to Red Rock alive.

1976
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:07,108
Now, one of y'all...

1977
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:10,190
is workin' with her.

1978
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:12,348
Or two of y'all is workin' with her.

1979
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:15,111
Or all y'all is.

1980
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:21,105
But only one of you poisoned the coffee.

1981
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:27,625
Now, what charms this bitch got

1982
01:49:27,740 --> 01:49:30,425
make a man brave a blizzard,

1983
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,383

(CHUCKLES)

1985
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:36,222
I'm sure I don't know.

1986
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:43,422
But John Ruth's tryin' to hang your woman.

1987
01:49:43,540 --> 01:49:45,349
So you kill him.

1988
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:47,269
Okay.

1989
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:49,382
Maybe.

1990
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:52,663
But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.

1991
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:54,145
He damn sure wasn't.

1992
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:56,986
But he sure enough layin' over there
dead now, though, ain't he?

1993
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:59,182
He damn sure is, you sons of bitches.

1994
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:02,065
Just like any one of us
would've drunk that coffee.

1995
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:04,308
Like me, goddamn it.

1996
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:07,390
Now, those of y'all

need to think about that.

1998
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:16,625
Think about how it could've been you
rollin' around here on this floor.

1999
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:20,790
And how the man standin' next
to you would be responsible.

Oh, that's right, Joe Gage.

01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:27,345
I'm lookin' at you.

2003
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:31,741
Not so fast, Chris.

2004
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:34,022
We'll get there.

2005
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:37,144
Let's slow it down.

2006
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:39,706
Let's slow it way down.

(GUN CLICKS)

2008
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:46,984
Who made the coffee?

2009
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:48,704
He did.

2010
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:52,230
Yeah, he did, didn't he?

2011
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:55,389
Yeah, he did, didn't he?

2012
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:58,709
But it's the stew that's got me thinkin'.

2013
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:03,064
Now, how long you said Minnie been gone?

2014
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:04,750
A week?

2015
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:07,345
Si.

2016
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:10,070
See...

2017
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:13,150
my mama used to make stew,

2018
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:16,825
and it always tasted the same,
no matter the meat.

2019
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:18,863
And there was another fellow
on the plantation,

2020
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:20,505
Uncle Charly.

2021
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:22,145
He made stew, too.

2022
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:23,944
And like my mama,

2023
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:27,951
I ate his stew from the time I was a whipper

2024
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:30,461
till I was a full-grown man.

2025
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:33,583
No matter the meat,

2026
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:36,544
it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.

2027
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:41,463
Now, I ain't had Minnie's stew
in six months, so I ain't no expert.

2028
01:51:41,580 --> 01:51:45,665
But that damn sure is...

2029
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:48,465
Minnie's stew.

2030
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:50,947
So if Minnie is on the north side

2031
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:53,540
visitin' her mama for a week,

2032
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:56,510
how'd she make the stew this mornin'?

2033
01:51:56,660 --> 01:51:58,185

And this...

2036
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:07,620
this is Sweet Dave's chair.

2037
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:09,788
When I sat in it earlier,

2039
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:14,346

01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:16,701
Uh, this may be Minnie's place,

2041
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:20,108
but this is damn sure

2042
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:22,302
Sweet Dave's chair.

2043
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:27,783
And if he went to the north side...

2044
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:31,781
I'm pretty goddamn sure

2045
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:34,585
this chair be goin' with him.

2046
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:41,063
What's in the chair?

2047
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:43,342

(WARREN CHUCKLES)

2053
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:02,670
Way I see it, Senor Bob,

2054
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:05,943
is whoever is workin' with her

2055
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:08,904
ain't who they say they is.

2056
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:10,863
And if it's you,

2057
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:13,108
that means Minnie and her man

2058
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:15,063
ain't at her mama's.

2059
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:18,662
They layin' out back there dead somewhere.

2060
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:20,828
Or if it's you, little British man,

2061
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:24,149
the real Oswaldo Mobray layin'
in a ditch somewhere

2062

and you just a English fella
passin' off his papers.

2064
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:32,704
which is the ugliest guy did it.

2065
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:35,391
Which makes it you, Joe Gage.

2066
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:39,789
So I take it you deduced
the coffee was poisoned

2067
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:41,868
while you were murdering the old man?

2068
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:44,710
Yes.

2069
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:47,346
Well, mi negro amigo,

2070
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:49,622
during that whole incident,

2071
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:52,346
I was sitting on that side of the room

2072
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:54,667
playing "Silent Night" on the piano.

2073
01:53:54,820 --> 01:53:57,824
Oh, I ain't say you poisoned the coffee.

2074
01:53:57,940 --> 01:54:00,910
I said you didn't make the stew.

2075
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:05,902
My theory is...

2076
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:09,024
you workin' with the man

2077
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:13,341
who poisoned the coffee,
and both of y'all murdered Minnie,

2078
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:16,384
Sweet Dave and whoever else
picked this bad-luck day

2079
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,344
to visit Minnie's Haberdashery this mornin'.

2080
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:23,226
And at some point, y'all intended

2081
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:25,820
to bushwhack John Ruth

2082
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:28,705
and free Daisy.

2083
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:31,266
But you didn't count on the blizzard,

2084
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:34,429
and you didn't count on the two of us.

2085
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:35,701
CHRIS: Hmm.

2086
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:41,068
That's far as I got. How am I doing?

2087
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:43,148
(CHUCKLES)

2088
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:47,426
You're a real imaginative nigger,

- ain't you?
- (LAUGHS)

2090
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:52,744
So, do you intend to murder me

2091
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:55,181
based on a far-fetched nigger theory,

2092
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:57,707
or can you prove it, cabron?

It ain't so far-fetched, Senor Bob.

2095
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:07,265
And it's a little bit more than a theory.

2096
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:14,191
How long you say you been workin' for Minnie?

2097
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:16,064
Four months.

2098
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:17,909
Mmm.

01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:20,705
See, if you'd have been here
two and a half years ago,

2100
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:24,666
you'd know 'bout that sign
used to hang up over the bar.

2101
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:27,226
Minnie mention that to you?

2102
01:55:28,540 --> 01:55:30,383
No.

2103
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:33,305
You want to know what
that sign said, Senor Bob?

2104
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:39,749
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed."

(CHRIS LAUGHS)

2106
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:46,822
Now, Minnie hung that sign up
the day she opened this haberdashery.

2107
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:49,910
And it hung over that bar every day

2108
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:53,030
till she took it down
a little over two years ago.

2109
01:55:54,620 --> 01:55:56,384
You know why she took it down?

2110
01:55:58,260 --> 01:56:00,786
She started lettin' in dogs.

01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:12,663
like Mexicans.

2115
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:14,703
So when you tell me

2116
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:18,381
Minnie went to the north side
to visit her mama,

2117
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:21,071
well, I find that highly unlikely.

2118

But when you tell me

2120
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:30,941
Minnie Mink took the haberdashery,

2121
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:35,025
the most precious thing to her
in the whole world,

2122
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:39,111
and left it in the hands
of a goddamn Mexican?

2123
01:56:40,580 --> 01:56:42,230
Well, that's what I meant in the barn

2124
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:45,071

don't sound like Minnie.

2129

(WARREN CHUCKLES)

2642
02:25:13,660 --> 02:25:17,551
He was a big bad cat worth $50,000.

2643
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:21,705
And every member of his gang
was worth at least ten.

2644
02:25:21,820 --> 02:25:24,744
Which finally explains why you worth ten.

2645
02:25:24,860 --> 02:25:27,181
And what's gonna happen when
that sun comes out, nigger?

2646
02:25:27,300 --> 02:25:30,031
So is my brother's 15 men
coming straight here for us.

2647
02:25:30,140 --> 02:25:32,029
Tell him, Grouch!

2648
02:25:32,140 --> 02:25:34,461
Jody got 15 men waiting in Red Rock.

2649
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:39,422
We couldn't kill John Ruth
and free Daisy here,

2650
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:44,068
their job was to sack the town,
kill John Ruth

2651
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:46,751
and free Daisy there.

2652
02:25:46,860 --> 02:25:50,387
Now, with my brother dead,
I'm in charge of this gang.

2653
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:51,865
- Right, boys?
- That's right, Daisy.

2654
02:25:51,980 --> 02:25:52,902
Oh, yeah.

2655
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:54,829
And, Chris, I am telling you,

2656
02:25:54,940 --> 02:25:59,264
you ain't done anything yet
that we can't forgive.

2657
02:25:59,380 --> 02:26:01,223
So, let's make a deal.

2658
02:26:01,340 --> 02:26:02,830
No deals, bitch.

2659
02:26:02,940 --> 02:26:05,386
You gonna let that nigger
speak for you, Chris?

2660
02:26:05,540 --> 02:26:09,226
Hold it, Warren.

2661
02:26:09,380 --> 02:26:12,350
Seeing as how she ain't got nothing to sell,

2662
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:16,465
I'm kinda curious about her sales pitch.

2663
02:26:16,580 --> 02:26:17,786
Humor me.

(WARREN GROANS)

2665
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:22,746

02:26:31,300 --> 02:26:36,067
What's... your... deal?

2667
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:38,182
Easy.

2668
02:26:38,300 --> 02:26:42,908
Take your gun, shoot that nigger dead.

Then we sit here all nice-like
for the next two days.

2670
02:26:46,980 --> 02:26:50,143
When the snow melts, we go to
Mexico, you go on to Red Rock,

2671

get that star pinned on your chest.

2672
02:26:52,420 --> 02:26:55,424
Hey, Pete. How much can we pay him?

2673
02:26:55,540 --> 02:26:59,750
Well, we could give him Marco.

2674
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:04,947
Bob's real name is Marco the Mexican.

2675
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:07,546
He's worth $12,000.

2676
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:09,867
WARREN: That's Marco the Mexican?

2677
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:11,829
Precisely, yeah.

(LAUGHS): Shit.

2679
02:27:13,740 --> 02:27:17,745
Now that I blowed his face off,
Marco ain't worth a peso.

in the next two days,

2684
02:27:25,180 --> 02:27:27,706
which is more than likely, you can have me.

2685

Under the name of English Pete Hicox,

2686
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:35,024
I got a federal bounty of $15,000 on my head.

2687
02:27:37,460 --> 02:27:39,110
It's all yours, Chris.

2688

2689
02:27:42,340 --> 02:27:46,106
you gonna talk yourself to death.

2691
02:27:49,220 --> 02:27:50,710
Grouch Douglass.

(WARREN LAUGHS)

2693

You heard of him?

2694
02:27:54,100 --> 02:27:56,421
Yeah, I heard of Grouch Douglass.

2695
02:27:56,540 --> 02:27:59,987
He worth ten, just like Daisy.

2696
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:02,182
Well, remind me...

2697
02:28:02,300 --> 02:28:07,466
why we wouldn't just kill all y'all, cash in.

2698
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:10,863
Oh, you can kill us all,
but you'll never spend a cent

2699
02:28:10,980 --> 02:28:12,266
of that bounty money,

2700
02:28:12,420 --> 02:28:14,787
and you'll never leave this mountain alive.

2701
02:28:14,900 --> 02:28:17,221
'Cause when that snow melts,
the rest of Jody's gang,

2702
02:28:17,380 --> 02:28:21,430
all 15 of 'em that are waiting
in Red Rock, are coming here.

2703
02:28:21,540 --> 02:28:24,271
Now, let's say you shoot us all.

2704
02:28:24,380 --> 02:28:27,987
If you really want all that
Domingre Gang bounty money,

2705
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:31,144
you still got to get
all our corpses into Red Rock.

2706
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:33,422
And that ain't gonna be so easy.

2707
02:28:33,540 --> 02:28:35,781
'Cause I doubt you can drive
a four-horse team.

2708
02:28:35,940 --> 02:28:38,750
And that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two-horse team.

2709
02:28:38,900 --> 02:28:43,551
So that means you're gonna have to lead
a string of horses into Red Rock.

2710
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:45,987
And with that deep snow after a blizzard,

2711
02:28:46,100 --> 02:28:48,387
you ain't gonna be able
to get away with any more than,

2712
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:50,582
say, one body per horse.

2713
02:28:50,700 --> 02:28:56,503
So that's you leading a string
of four horses into Red Rock.

2714
02:28:56,620 --> 02:29:00,102
And with all them horses in that snow

2715
02:29:00,220 --> 02:29:03,224
and you all by your lonesome,
you're gonna be a mite poky.

2716
02:29:03,340 --> 02:29:05,661
And you're gonna run smack dab
into the Domingre Gang.

2717
02:29:05,780 --> 02:29:07,703
And again, Grouch, how many is that?

2718
02:29:07,820 --> 02:29:09,185
JOE: 15 killers strong.

2719
02:29:09,300 --> 02:29:14,067
And when those 15 killers come across you

2720
02:29:14,180 --> 02:29:16,023
in possession of all our dead bodies,

2721
02:29:16,140 --> 02:29:18,507
they ain't just gonna
kill you and that nigger!

2722
02:29:18,620 --> 02:29:20,543
They gonna go back to Red Rock

2723
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:24,142
and kill every son of a bitch in that town!

2726
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:30,030
