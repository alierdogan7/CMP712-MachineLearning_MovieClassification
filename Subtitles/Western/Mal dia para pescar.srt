1
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:12,713
 The man 's badly injured.
 lt was a terrific blow.

2
00:01:12,793 --> 00:01:15,793
 The crowd is very jumpy.

3
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,312
 Projectiles are landing onstage.!

4
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:20,632
 Please, gentlemen, calm down.!

5
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:23,072
 Bottles are being thrown.

6
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:26,073
 They're setting fire to the stage.!

7
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:25,632
 What's the diagnosis?

8
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:28,633
 He's not moving or complaining.
 He's swelling up like a balloon.

9
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:31,392
 One rib's stuck in his lung,
 his tibia's exposed,

10
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:33,112
 a concussion, most likely.

11
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:35,792
 He landed on the seats, doctor.

12
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:38,793
 Sorry, but l think it's spinal,

13
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:42,753
 whether it's fractured or not.

14
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:54,553
 WORLD CHAMPlON JACOB VAN OPPEN
 lN SANTA MARÍA

15
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:02,832
 l didn't do anything because
 there's nothing to be done.

16
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,833
 You'd have to toss a coin
 to know where to start.

17
00:03:06,873 --> 00:03:09,873
 -That bad?
 -l'll tell you.

18
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:17,633
 Multiple traumas,
 deep coma, pallor,

19
00:03:18,113 --> 00:03:21,113
 weak pulse, severe tachypnea
 and cyanosis.

20
00:03:21,153 --> 00:03:24,032
 The right lung has collapsed.

21
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:27,033
 Crackling sound
 and right sixth rib bent.

22
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,192
 Tumefaction in the lower lung.

23
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:31,472
 The coma's deepening

24
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:33,952
 and acute anemia increasing.

25
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:36,953
 Possible broken ribs.

26
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:40,353
 lsn't that enough?
 lf l were you, l'd leave him be.

27
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:44,753
 My patients die on the table.

28
00:03:44,873 --> 00:03:46,912
 Get him ready.

29
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:49,913
 Alright.

30
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:13,873
 BAD DAY TO GO FlSHlNG

31
00:04:58,273 --> 00:05:01,273
 Hey, friend?

32
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:05,393
 Hey, pal?

33
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:11,313
 You got a cigarette?

34
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:36,873
 The man about to come out is
 the top wrestler of his generation.

35
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:41,273
 World Heavyweight Champion,
 Gold Medal at the Spartakiada,

36
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:44,873
 before being rescued
 from the claws of communism.

37
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:54,752
 Boxers, wrestlers,

38
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:57,152
 judo fighters, karate experts,

39
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:58,752
 tennis players, dancers...

40
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:01,753
 We take on anyone.!

41
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:20,832
 Where's the brave man who'll
 risk his life

42
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,833
 for 1 ,000 dollars?

43
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:27,153
 1 ,000 dollars!

44
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:41,792
 Yes, ladies and gentlemen,

45
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:44,793
 life is an adventure
 without end.

46
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:49,232
 And now, a big hand...

47
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:52,233
 for the World Champion,
 Jacob Van Oppen!

48
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:55,953
 lt'll be seven days.

49
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,272
 How long does a call
 to Germany take?

50
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:07,273
 Germany... two or three days.

51
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,992
 Depends on the operator.

52
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:12,993
 May l? lt's to the lnternational
 Wrestling Federation.

53
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:15,952
 When they answer, ask for

54
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:18,953
 Herr Mallwitz, please.

55
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:29,793
 -You pay in advance here.
 -Yes, l'll go to the bank tomorrow.

56
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,833
 Here's my card.

57
00:09:38,113 --> 00:09:40,032
 -Ronco.
 -Ronco?

58
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:43,033
 -That's me.
 -Nice to meet you, Ronco.

59
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:43,312
 He trained in the Leipzig school,

60
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:46,313
 the best in the Democratic
 Republic of Germany.

61
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:48,592
 He won a gold medal
 at the Spartakiada.

62
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:50,272
 He didn 't win at the Olympics

63
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:52,872
 because when he escaped
 he became stateless.

64
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:55,472
 He lost his crown...
 well, he didn't lose it,

65
00:10:55,473 --> 00:10:58,473
 it was stolen from him in Gstaad.
 A bad ruling.

66
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:01,152
 The appeals board
 has it as an open case.

67
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:04,153
 Next year he'll regain the title.

68
00:11:06,313 --> 00:11:09,313
 That's him with President Honecker.

69
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:12,272
 They were on informal terms.

70
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:15,273
 He's never been better.
 He may have put on a few kilos,

71
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:19,393
 but that's why we're on this tour
 of 27 South American cities.

72
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,312
 And how could we forget
 Santa María

73
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:28,313
 on this lead-up to
 the world championship?

74
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:33,232
 Prince?

75
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:36,233
 Yes. Prince.

76
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:39,672
 l could help...

77
00:11:39,673 --> 00:11:42,632
 But this is
 fishing week and...

78
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,912
 the baptisms are today.

79
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,913
 l've got all my journalists out.

80
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:51,072
 But l thought your paper,

81
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:54,073
 the temple of culture and wisdom
 in this town,

82
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:57,273
 would like an exclusive on
 the visit of a world champion.

83
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,712
 Not to mention the 1 ,000 dollars

84
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:04,752
 -we're offering on Saturday.
 -What was that?

85
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:07,753
 The champion challenges anyone
 to last 3 minutes in the ring.

86
00:12:13,113 --> 00:12:14,872
 Do you smoke?

87
00:12:14,873 --> 00:12:17,873
 Yeah, sure. Thanks.

88
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:21,792
 l only smoke because
 it bothers them.

89
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:24,793
 An excellent reason.

90
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:31,752
 Jorge!

91
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:34,753
 Well... When can we take the photo?

92
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,833
 The champion wants to pay tribute
 to this nation's freedom fighter.

93
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:41,273
 From hero to hero.

94
00:12:50,393 --> 00:12:51,712
 Mrs. Lima, l presume.

95
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:54,713
 -Yes?
 -l've come to see Ronnie.

96
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:01,912
 ln the gym they spoke highly of you.

97
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:04,032
 l know you were
 a good middle-weight.

98
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,033
 Maybe a bit unlucky, Ronnie,

99
00:13:07,073 --> 00:13:10,072
 but l can see that
 you're a good man,

100
00:13:10,073 --> 00:13:13,073
 That's why l'm giving you
 this chance.

101
00:13:18,473 --> 00:13:21,473
 Thanks, Ronnie.

102
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:25,153
 -l don't know.
 -Ronnie,

103
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:28,353
 this isn't like lying.
 lt's like the movies:

104
00:13:29,473 --> 00:13:32,473
 a guy dies, and later on
 he appears in another movie.

105
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:36,472
 lt's like magic.

106
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:39,112
 See this handkerchief?

107
00:13:39,113 --> 00:13:40,432
 Look at it.

108
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,672
 l pull it through.

109
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:45,673
 l put it in my hand.

110
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:50,553
 l blow...

111
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,433
 lt's vanished.
 Now check your pocket.

112
00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:06,472
 lt's magic.

113
00:14:06,473 --> 00:14:08,032
 Wrestling's the same.

114
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:10,712
 A great wrestler has to
 conceal his tricks.

115
00:14:10,713 --> 00:14:13,713
 Because everyone wants him to.
 They want to believe it's true.

116
00:14:19,953 --> 00:14:22,953
 Just go to the paper
 and make the challenge.

117
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:25,993
 And then stay away.

118
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:29,273
 lf people see us together,
 the magic's gone.

119
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:32,552
 And if you run into Jacob,

120
00:14:32,553 --> 00:14:35,553
 stay away and not a word,

121
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:38,793
 because he respects
 a pro who knows his job.

122
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:44,712
 What'll my dad say?

123
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:47,713
 We said we'd only think about us.

124
00:14:51,713 --> 00:14:52,832
 Oh, Juan Andrés.

125
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,832
 Oh, Maria Victoria.

126
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,833
 -You're so wonderful.
 -So are you.

127
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:01,913
 Kiss me, darling.

128
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:06,872
 Where?

129
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,873
 Right here.

130
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,432
 Like that?

131
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:26,433
 You're so romantic.

132
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:42,873
 Afternoon. Everything alright?

133
00:15:50,153 --> 00:15:53,153
 ls everything alright?

134
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:01,072
 On requesting baptism
 for your children,

135
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:04,073
 do you know that you must
 educate them in the faith?

136
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:08,273
 Do you promise to spurn
 the temptations of evil?

137
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:09,832
 Yes, l promise.

138
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,833
 Do you promise to renounce the Devil,
 the source of sin?

139
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:14,712
 Yes, l promise.

140
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:17,713
 Then we shall proceed.

141
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,833
 Hey, stop! You're 30 short!

142
00:16:28,673 --> 00:16:30,552
 You're 30 short.

143
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:33,553
 -Relax, here's my card.
 -l've got it. Gimme the money.

144
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,913
 Here.

145
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:43,832
 And the rest?

146
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,152
 l just got here.
 You're leaving me with nothing.

147
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:49,153
 The money.

148
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:51,832
 -Alright?
 -Okay.

149
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,833
 Ciao.

150
00:16:56,593 --> 00:16:58,072
 Hey, pal!

151
00:16:58,073 --> 00:17:01,073
 -Yeah?
 -Where is there a florist?

152
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:12,073
 FLOWERS, URNS, CANDLES

153
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:38,072
 Unless my memory fails me,

154
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:41,073
 the proscenium
 is smaller than in Trieste.

155
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:44,993
 Do you know?
 La Duse worked there.

156
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,992
 La Duse herself.

157
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:52,993
 The first woman to play Hamlet.

158
00:17:56,753 --> 00:17:59,753
 Three people are asking after you.
 They're from the gym.

159
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:03,432
 Good. Let them in.

160
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:06,432
 Any doubts? Any questions?

161
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:09,433
 -When do we work with Van Oppen?
 -Easy does it, boys.

162
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:13,152
 As the champ gets to know you.

163
00:18:13,153 --> 00:18:14,752
 When do we start?

164
00:18:14,753 --> 00:18:16,792
 Start?

165
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:19,793
 Now.

166
00:18:23,913 --> 00:18:26,913
 He looks bigger in person.

167
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:30,913
 -Who?
 -Jacob. Barely fits through the door.

168
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:35,113
 -What door?
 -The church door.

169
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:10,473
 God bless.

170
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:13,912
 Our father who art in Heaven,

171
00:19:13,913 --> 00:19:16,913
 hallowed be Thy name...

172
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:21,633
 WORLD CHAMPlON

173
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,393
 CHALLENGE

174
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:14,393
 Thank you.

175
00:21:06,513 --> 00:21:09,513
 Can l go now?

176
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,232
 No one else is coming. Can l go?

177
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:18,233
 Yeah, sure. Go.

178
00:21:19,553 --> 00:21:22,553
 Someone was asking for you.

179
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:45,953
 -Ronnie!
 -Hey, Prince...

180
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:48,312
 Come up.

181
00:21:48,313 --> 00:21:50,152
 l went to the paper.

182
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:51,432
 Come up!

183
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:54,433
 -You know what they said?
 -Grab a beer and come up.

184
00:21:54,873 --> 00:21:56,832
 -Where are they?
 -Get up here!

185
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,833
 l'll come round in the morning.
 Take my card.

186
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,192
 But l want the money now, l need it.

187
00:22:03,193 --> 00:22:06,193
 -Later, Ronnie, we agreed.
 -But l want it now.

188
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:10,032
 -You know l need it.
 -Go home.

189
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:13,033
 l went there and said
 what you told me to say.

190
00:22:13,713 --> 00:22:16,713
 Gimme the money l need it.

191
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:20,593
 Go home and don't talk to anyone.
 Go on.

192
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,752
 -Anything else?
 -No, thanks.

193
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:13,753
 Oh, yes, the bill.

194
00:23:15,073 --> 00:23:18,073
 -Gloria.
 -No. Jessica.

195
00:23:18,473 --> 00:23:21,473
 Gloria doesn't work here anymore.

196
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:25,393
 You'll be Gloria to me.

197
00:23:27,953 --> 00:23:30,953
 lt's on them.

198
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:37,313
 -Cheers, gentlemen.
 -Cheers!

199
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:40,952
 -Do you want to play?
 -No, thanks.

200
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:43,953
 -One hand?
 -No, no. Thanks.

201
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,833
 Miss, are you alright?

202
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,793
 -Excuse me.
 -May l see you home?

203
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:29,273
 -Where were you heading?
 -Me?

204
00:24:30,273 --> 00:24:33,273
 l'm in no hurry.

205
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:52,833
 -Are you sure you're alright?
 -Yeah.

206
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:58,553
 lt got late and started raining.

207
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:07,673
 ''Adriana.''

208
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:18,553
 May l?

209
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:25,833
 -Where did you say you were going?
 -l didn't.

210
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:29,072
 Straight ahead.

211
00:25:29,073 --> 00:25:32,073
 -Do you want to stop for a drink?
 -No.

212
00:25:34,753 --> 00:25:37,753
 -Do you want to go to my hotel?
 -What?

213
00:25:39,153 --> 00:25:41,312
 -What did you say?
 -No, nothing.

214
00:25:41,313 --> 00:25:44,313
 Just thinking out loud.

215
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:48,193
 Thinking gets you into trouble.

216
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:56,953
 lt's here.

217
00:26:05,753 --> 00:26:08,753
 You can come in for a drink.

218
00:26:19,793 --> 00:26:22,112
 You didn't tell me your name.

219
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,752
 Orsini. Prince Orsini.

220
00:26:24,753 --> 00:26:27,392
 Prince...

221
00:26:27,393 --> 00:26:30,393
 What kind of prince?
 A prince, prince?

222
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,312
 Descendent of the Orsinis,

223
00:26:33,313 --> 00:26:36,313
 the Republic of Sienna,
 a Byzantine family.

224
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:40,873
 What happened to the family?

225
00:26:40,993 --> 00:26:43,993
 The 15th century, signorina.

226
00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:47,153
 -1500?
 -That's it.

227
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:50,673
 ...34 times the distance between
 the Earth and the Moon...

228
00:26:55,153 --> 00:26:58,153
 And now, tonight's last request.

229
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:01,433
 from Braulio to Marta,
 ''Nights Without You''.

230
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,872
 What time is it?

231
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:27,873
 Nine o'clock.

232
00:27:37,713 --> 00:27:40,713
 l saw the poster in the square.

233
00:27:42,313 --> 00:27:45,312
 ls it true?

234
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:48,313
 -ls the 1 ,000 dollars true?
 -What are you talking about?

235
00:27:52,913 --> 00:27:55,913
 My fiancé is going to
 fight the champion.

236
00:27:57,753 --> 00:28:00,032
 lt's no joke.

237
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:03,033
 He'll fight, but first you have to
 deposit the money.

238
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:05,832
 Fight the champ?

239
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,712
 You'll be left without a fiancé,
 miss.

240
00:28:07,713 --> 00:28:10,713
 l saw him in the church. He's old.

241
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:13,793
 -Your fiancé, does he know about this?
 -No.

242
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,832
 Better that way.

243
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,833
 Besides, there's already a contender.

244
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,033
 -Who?
 -A boxer. Ronnie Lima.

245
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:30,153
 Ronnie? Our Ronnie?

246
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:33,833
 Now you're talking crap.
 He's a drunk, everyone knows.

247
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,152
 -Why him and not my fiancé?
 -That's how it is.

248
00:28:38,153 --> 00:28:40,672
 -Why?
 -There can only be one contender.

249
00:28:40,673 --> 00:28:42,032
 Why?

250
00:28:42,033 --> 00:28:45,033
 Out of respect.

251
00:28:46,313 --> 00:28:48,392
 The ceremony, miss...

252
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,393
 Or do you bury men
 without a wake here?

253
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:02,872
 Your beauty and youth is your excuse.

254
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:03,992
 Ronnie's a drunk.

255
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,993
 Everyone knows
 he'll be tanked on Saturday.

256
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:11,233
 Goodbye.

257
00:29:29,113 --> 00:29:32,113
 That's enough for today, Ronnie.

258
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:35,313
 That not good enough?

259
00:30:46,153 --> 00:30:48,992
 There's another mistake here.

260
00:30:48,993 --> 00:30:50,912
 Bravo, Jorge. Beautiful photo.

261
00:30:50,913 --> 00:30:53,792
 -Good day to you.
 -Hello, boys.

262
00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:56,793
 No, there's no 'h' in it.

263
00:31:05,713 --> 00:31:08,713
 -Prince!
 -Ah, Heber!

264
00:31:09,353 --> 00:31:12,353
 l came to thank you for the headline.

265
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:16,433
 l'm sorry, your contender had
 some trouble with the police.

266
00:31:17,393 --> 00:31:20,112
 He'll be held for a few days.

267
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:23,113
 -But luckily, this lady came...
 -Adriana.

268
00:31:24,153 --> 00:31:27,032
 My friend Adriana. We've met.

269
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:29,432
 She came to accept the challenge
 in her fiancé's name.

270
00:31:29,433 --> 00:31:32,112
 Yes. l myself asked her to come.

271
00:31:32,113 --> 00:31:35,113
 Then you agree?

272
00:31:40,113 --> 00:31:43,113
 Yes. Of course l agree.

273
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:47,353
 -So your fiancé's up to it then?
 -Where's the money?

274
00:31:49,313 --> 00:31:51,672
 l know the paper's
 sponsoring the challenge.

275
00:31:51,673 --> 00:31:53,952
 This evening or
 tomorrow morning at the latest.

276
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,432
 ls tomorrow morning here
 at the Liberal alright?

277
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:59,433
 lt's alright with me.
 We'll validate the challenge.

278
00:32:06,873 --> 00:32:09,512
 Heber, does the death penalty
 exist in Santa María?

279
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:10,632
 Why?

280
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:13,633
 Because a man
 just got a death sentence.

281
00:32:26,193 --> 00:32:29,193
 Ladies and gentlemen, don't miss it!
 One time only in Santa María,

299
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:28,153
 Good afternoon.

300
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:48,352
 Radio Santa María here.

301
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:50,192
 Lorenzo García speaking,

302
00:35:50,193 --> 00:35:53,193
 broadcasting this unique event
 for our city.

303
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,872
 The newspaper El Liberal,

304
00:35:55,873 --> 00:35:58,873
 -organizer of this superb event,...

305
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:01,993
 takes pleasure in presenting
 this exhibition by

306
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:05,833
 the German wrestling champion,

 -Check your blood pressure!
 -Popcorn! Coffee!

308
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,633
 Bingo cards!

309
00:36:36,593 --> 00:36:39,593
 Jacob Van Oppen,
 sportsman, is tough,

310
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:41,832
 difficult and rather prickly,

311
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,312
 so we ask spectators

312
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:47,313
 to take care to avoid any gesture
 that may bother or infuriate

313
00:36:47,713 --> 00:36:49,152
 this great sportsman.

314
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:52,032
 l recommend that
 you remain in your seats

315
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:55,033
 and enjoy this splendid show,
 ladies and gentlemen.

316
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,673
 A tractor tyre.

317
00:36:59,753 --> 00:37:02,512
 lncredible.

318
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:05,513
 An oxygen tank.

319
00:37:05,553 --> 00:37:08,553
 Amazing.

320
00:37:08,953 --> 00:37:10,912
 A bathtub.

321
00:37:10,913 --> 00:37:12,152
 Wonderful.

322
00:37:12,153 --> 00:37:15,153
 And you have
 50 cents discount

323
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,433
 on the St. Maria Bingo.

324
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:24,273
 First number of the night.

325
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:28,193
 1 , 8: 18.

326
00:37:33,913 --> 00:37:36,913
 21 : 2, 1 .

327
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:48,953
 41 : 4, 1 .

328
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:55,312
 14: 1 , 4.

329
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:58,313
 Bingo!

330
00:38:07,793 --> 00:38:10,793
 Since word spread about the fight,
 the theatre's been filling up.

331
00:38:12,193 --> 00:38:15,193
 l raised ticket prices to keep
 pressure off the champ,

332
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:18,233
 but people keep paying.

333
00:38:19,953 --> 00:38:22,032
 All thanks to you.

334
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:25,033
 Did you deposit the money?
 l want to see the money.

335
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:28,633
 -When can l see it?
 -Miss, what's your problem?

336
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:32,393
 We need the money to get married.

337
00:38:36,353 --> 00:38:39,192
 You love your fiancé?

338
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:42,193
 Then go home and forget about it.

339
00:38:43,313 --> 00:38:46,313
 Don't push your luck.
 Don't make him look ridiculous.

340
00:38:47,713 --> 00:38:50,713
 My fiancé is 23 and l'm 26.

341
00:38:53,993 --> 00:38:56,993
 Right now he's working in the store.

342
00:38:57,393 --> 00:39:00,393
 Porfilio Brothers. Go and see him.

343
00:39:00,593 --> 00:39:03,593
 They call him The Turk,
 but he's Syrian. He has the papers.

344
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:26,833
 How much does a wedding cost
 in this part of the world?

345
00:39:28,593 --> 00:39:31,593
 -1 ,000 dollars is a lot of money.
 -Single and widowed.

346
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,953
 A sad fate for a woman
 so young and beautiful.

347
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:36,392
 Single, no.

348
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:38,752
 We can marry with that 1 ,000 dollars.

349
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:41,232
 And l won't be a widow.
 Your champ is very old.

350
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:44,233
 Who said he was an ordinary man?

351
00:39:45,313 --> 00:39:48,313
 What if he can still
 break arms, legs,

352
00:39:49,073 --> 00:39:52,073
 ribs, collarbones?
 And if he's not that old?

353
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:55,992
 You don't know
 what he's capable of.

354
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,192
 Even schoolgirls jump better.

355
00:39:58,193 --> 00:40:00,992
 Yes, but when it really starts,
 he's an animal.

356
00:40:00,993 --> 00:40:03,993
 l swear to you, he knows his job.

357
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:07,233
 World Champion.
 And in all the weights, miss.

358
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:34,552
 -Hello.
 -Hello.

359
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:37,272
 -ls everything alright?
 -Everything's fine.

360
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:40,273
 -You don't need anything?
 -No.

361
00:41:40,993 --> 00:41:43,993
 Excuse me, Mr. Prince...

362
00:41:44,353 --> 00:41:47,272
 Have you got the money?

363
00:41:47,273 --> 00:41:49,032
 No. Tomorrow morning.

364
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:52,033
 l had a problem with the bank,
 but it's sorted out, don't worry.

365
00:42:03,753 --> 00:42:06,232
 -What's that?
 -Nothing.

366
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:07,592
 ''Nothing''? What is it?

367
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:10,593
 lt's cyclical, although l don't
 understand the cycle.

368
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:14,233
 One day he'll strangle me
 just because l'm nearby.

369
00:42:16,273 --> 00:42:19,273
 -My card.
 -No, please, Mr. Prince.

370
00:44:37,713 --> 00:44:40,713
 l'll take one.

371
00:44:48,393 --> 00:44:51,393
 THE MATADOR VERSUS THE STRANGER

372
00:44:57,673 --> 00:45:00,673
 Come in.

373
00:45:01,153 --> 00:45:04,153
 Look who's here,
 the new business champion.

374
00:45:05,593 --> 00:45:08,593
 l came to thank you, Heber.
 Ever since you've backed this,

375
00:45:08,753 --> 00:45:10,992
 everyone wants to watch
 the champ in training.

376
00:45:10,993 --> 00:45:13,993
 -l'm glad. Very glad.
 -l read your front page.

377
00:45:15,553 --> 00:45:18,553
 Great headline: ''The Matador.''

378
00:45:21,193 --> 00:45:24,193
 -How did you come up with it?
 -lt's not mine.

379
00:45:24,793 --> 00:45:27,432
 They've called him that
 since the incident.

380
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,433
 -lf you can call it an incident.
 -What do you mean?

381
00:45:31,513 --> 00:45:34,513
 Right, you're not from around here.
 lt was a couple of years ago,

382
00:45:35,153 --> 00:45:38,153
 when he worked in the country.

383
00:45:39,033 --> 00:45:42,033
 The girl, who was unattached then,

384
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,873
 went to a hairdresser,
 a friend of hers from school.

385
00:45:46,113 --> 00:45:49,113
 She fell asleep
 while she was waiting.

386
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:52,193
 This friend, as a joke,
 shaved her head.

387
00:45:55,273 --> 00:45:58,273
 When she woke up,
 she got hysterical and ran out.

388
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:01,833
 The whole town laughed.

389
00:46:03,313 --> 00:46:06,313
 The Turk was passing by,
 they told him about it,

390
00:46:07,273 --> 00:46:10,273
 he found the hairdresser
 and with a razor...

391
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:14,433
 he sliced off the man's ears.

392
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:20,433
 The guy can still hear...
 through the holes.

393
00:46:26,513 --> 00:46:28,112
 -That's that.
 -What happened?

394
00:46:28,113 --> 00:46:31,113
 ''What happened?'' The guy's crazy.

395
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:33,752
 He barely even saw me.
 He said,

396
00:46:33,753 --> 00:46:36,392
 ''l don't like being called 'Matador'''.

397
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,112
 He knows we all call him that.

398
00:46:38,113 --> 00:46:41,113
 lt's not the same as
 seeing it on the front page.

399
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:44,633
 l said it's freedom of the press,
 we're in a democracy...

400
00:46:44,673 --> 00:46:47,512
 The girl saved me.
 She kicked him,

401
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,513
 spat at him and calmed him down.

402
00:46:51,313 --> 00:46:54,313
 He put on his fishing shorts
 and l got a shot of him

403
00:46:55,073 --> 00:46:58,073
 -lifting Ramirez's cow.
 -A cow?

404
00:47:00,433 --> 00:47:03,433
 She watched him,
 proud as a mother, smoking away.

405
00:47:04,273 --> 00:47:06,432
 He put the cow down
 and started running,

406
00:47:06,433 --> 00:47:08,712
 non-stop from Bartolomé Mitre
 to Saravia Square,

407
00:47:08,713 --> 00:47:11,713
 doing laps behind the park.

408
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:14,512
 l get it, l do.

409
00:47:14,513 --> 00:47:17,513
 Poor kid,
 l've seen so many cases like this.

410
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:22,592
 Character is a mystery.

411
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:25,593
 lt doesn't come from big muscles.

412
00:47:34,473 --> 00:47:37,473
 Tasty toffee apples.

413
00:48:27,033 --> 00:48:29,152
 -Yes?
 -Your call's ready.

414
00:48:29,153 --> 00:48:32,153
 Good, pass it to me.

415
00:50:24,593 --> 00:50:27,593
 Thanks, Gloria.

416
00:50:29,633 --> 00:50:32,633
 You should get some sun
 on those legs.

417
00:50:34,513 --> 00:50:37,513
 Why don't you find a friend
 and we'll go to lsla Paraiso?

418
00:50:37,593 --> 00:50:39,072
 l'm taking the champ.

419
00:50:39,073 --> 00:50:42,073
 How about one of those in the back?

420
00:50:42,953 --> 00:50:45,953
 -Judi, do you want to go to the beach?
 -Alright.

421
00:52:26,153 --> 00:52:28,952
 Gloria...

422
00:52:28,953 --> 00:52:31,953
 Open up some bottles.
 We're going to celebrate.

423
00:52:55,153 --> 00:52:57,152
 Gentlemen!

424
00:52:57,153 --> 00:53:00,153
 A round for everyone!
 lt's on me!

425
00:54:35,593 --> 00:54:38,593
 Cheers!

426
00:55:33,353 --> 00:55:36,353
 l saw you this afternoon
 at the Apollo.

427
00:55:38,073 --> 00:55:41,073
 Straight away l see
 what people are like.

428
00:56:00,753 --> 00:56:03,753
 -ls he alright?
 -Yeah, it's cyclical.

429
00:56:06,593 --> 00:56:09,312
 Are you sure?

430
00:56:09,313 --> 00:56:12,313
 What's wrong with him?

431
00:56:13,433 --> 00:56:16,072
 ls he sick?

432
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:18,352
 Shall l call a doctor?

433
00:56:18,353 --> 00:56:21,353
 He can't breathe.

434
00:56:22,753 --> 00:56:24,832
 Something's up. Why not?

435
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:27,592
 -l'll call a doctor.
 -No.

436
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:30,593
 -You sure you don't want me to...?
 -No, no! Get out! Now!

437
00:56:33,113 --> 00:56:36,113
 ldiots.

438
00:56:51,153 --> 00:56:52,472
 No, no...

439
00:56:52,473 --> 00:56:55,473
 l told you clearly
 1 -0-7-6, not 1 -0-3-6.

440
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,352
 Yes, l know we're friends.

441
00:56:59,353 --> 00:57:02,353
 But one thing is friendship
 and another is business.

442
00:57:02,513 --> 00:57:05,312
 Yes, it's the first time
 it's happened, l know.

443
00:57:05,313 --> 00:57:08,313
 You have to understand,
 it's making me nervous.

444
00:57:08,433 --> 00:57:11,433
 No. That's no excuse. l requested
 the transfer four days ago.

445
00:57:13,393 --> 00:57:16,393
 Please, check it again.
 1-0-7-6.

446
00:57:16,593 --> 00:57:18,472
 Hello!

447
00:57:18,473 --> 00:57:21,473
 -Are you sure? Tomorrow morning?
 -Who is this?

448
00:57:21,713 --> 00:57:24,272
 Alright. Perfect.

449
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:27,273
 No, your word does reassure me.

450
00:57:27,633 --> 00:57:29,632
 Hello. Hello.

451
00:57:29,633 --> 00:57:31,752
 No. Thank you, Mr. Ramirez.

452
00:57:31,753 --> 00:57:34,753
 -Bubi?
 -No, thank you. Ciao.

453
00:57:37,633 --> 00:57:40,633
 At last. Tomorrow morning
 we'll have the money.

454
00:57:41,073 --> 00:57:42,792
 A setback with the bank,

455
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:45,432
 but midday tomorrow
 l'll have the money.

456
00:57:45,433 --> 00:57:48,433
 Alright.

457
00:57:55,393 --> 00:57:58,312
 Excuse me. Sometimes l laugh
 and l don't know why.

458
00:57:58,313 --> 00:58:00,552
 Yeah, l understand.

459
00:58:00,553 --> 00:58:02,672
 -l'm going. Things to do...
 -Sure.

460
00:58:02,673 --> 00:58:05,472
 Sometimes l forget you're so busy.

461
00:58:05,473 --> 00:58:08,473
 l've got so much spare time.

462
00:58:09,073 --> 00:58:11,992
 lf l were a smart guy
 instead of a cut-rate journalist,

463
00:58:11,993 --> 00:58:14,993
 l'd think all this was a sham.

464
00:58:15,193 --> 00:58:16,392
 What's that?

465
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:19,393
 No, l know that's not the case.
 l'm just supposing.

466
00:58:21,033 --> 00:58:23,832
 l know lots of foreigners
 who think they're clever,

467
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,833
 stick their noses where they
 don't belong, talk non-stop...

468
00:58:29,153 --> 00:58:31,152
 My friend...

469
00:58:31,153 --> 00:58:33,032
 You're pale. Are you okay?

470
00:58:33,033 --> 00:58:36,033
 Shall l open the window?

471
00:58:37,513 --> 00:58:40,513
 No, wait a second.

472
00:58:41,993 --> 00:58:44,472
 l think you need help.

473
00:58:44,473 --> 00:58:47,473
 Someone to lend you a hand.
 And that could be me.

474
00:58:50,673 --> 00:58:53,673
 -Help with what?
 -With what, Prince?

475
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:57,032
 With the deposit.

476
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,033
 lf it comes to that,
 l can say that l've got it.

477
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:06,992
 Let's see if l get this.

478
00:59:06,993 --> 00:59:09,993
 -You'll handle the deposit?
 -The deposit? What for?

479
00:59:18,393 --> 00:59:21,393
 lncredible.

480
00:59:22,353 --> 00:59:25,353
 This is unbelievable.

481
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:29,033
 You couldn't arrange it with the girl,

482
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:31,912
 you don't have the money,

483
00:59:31,913 --> 00:59:33,952
 and you don't think you can win.

484
00:59:33,953 --> 00:59:35,392
 What do you take me for?

485
00:59:35,393 --> 00:59:38,393
 For God's sake, Prince.
 What have you got yourself into?

486
00:59:47,873 --> 00:59:50,872
 That girl
 wants to see the money.

487
00:59:50,873 --> 00:59:53,873
 She'll kick up a stink here.

488
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:57,553
 Tomorrow could be a very tricky day.

489
00:59:58,873 --> 01:00:01,873
 Why don't you go to your hotel?
 Take a shower and pack your bag.

490
01:00:04,993 --> 01:00:07,993
 There's an early morning bus.

491
01:00:46,353 --> 01:00:49,353
 Hello?

492
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:54,833
 Hello?

493
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:11,873
 Mario?

494
01:01:17,913 --> 01:01:20,432
 l'm the impresario, Orsini.
 Prince Orsini.

495
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:23,433
 Manager of Jacob Van Oppen,
 the World Champion.

496
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:28,833
 Oh, yeah. At your service.

497
01:01:34,953 --> 01:01:37,953
 lt's about the money,
 the 1 ,000 dollars.

498
01:01:38,113 --> 01:01:39,912
 To put your mind at ease.

499
01:01:39,913 --> 01:01:42,913
 lt was transferred this morning,
 and will be deposited tomorrow.

500
01:01:43,873 --> 01:01:46,712
 Good.

501
01:01:46,713 --> 01:01:49,032
 But l wanted to talk about
 some other things too.

502
01:01:49,033 --> 01:01:52,033
 Excuse me. l have to finish up.

503
01:01:52,673 --> 01:01:55,512
 -What's it about?
 -Nothing in particular.

504
01:01:55,513 --> 01:01:58,513
 Everything's been said, Mario.

505
01:01:58,753 --> 01:02:01,432
 But l consider it my duty
 to say it straight out.

506
01:02:01,433 --> 01:02:04,433
 The truth. To you.

507
01:02:07,113 --> 01:02:10,113
 l'd like you to look at this.

508
01:02:12,713 --> 01:02:15,713
 lt's in other languages,
 but you get the idea.

509
01:02:15,793 --> 01:02:18,552
 The photos help.

510
01:02:18,553 --> 01:02:21,553
 Golden Belt, World Champion.

511
01:02:22,233 --> 01:02:25,233
 Eight columns, front pages,
 the Spartakiada...

512
01:02:25,273 --> 01:02:28,273
 60,000 people watching, Mario.

513
01:02:28,313 --> 01:02:31,313
 That's a champion.
 No one can beat him.

514
01:02:32,953 --> 01:02:35,592
 No one can last
 three minutes with him.

515
01:02:35,593 --> 01:02:38,593
 One minute would be a miracle.

516
01:02:39,393 --> 01:02:42,393
 l don't mean you're not
 stronger than the champ.

517
01:02:43,873 --> 01:02:46,552
 You're younger, more vigorous.

518
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:49,392
 l'd sign a paper saying that.

519
01:02:49,393 --> 01:02:52,072
 lf the champ bought this business,

520
01:02:52,073 --> 01:02:55,073
 in 6 months he'd be begging.

521
01:02:55,273 --> 01:02:58,273
 You, on the other hand,
 will be rich in two years.

522
01:02:59,393 --> 01:03:02,393
 Why? Because you understand business.

523
01:03:02,993 --> 01:03:05,432
 The champ doesn't.

524
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:08,112
 He was trained

525
01:03:08,113 --> 01:03:09,992
 to break ribs,

526
01:03:09,993 --> 01:03:12,272
 to bend you at the waist and knees

527
01:03:12,273 --> 01:03:15,273
 and put you on the mat.

528
01:03:18,153 --> 01:03:21,153
 Each to their own profession.

529
01:03:22,073 --> 01:03:25,073
 Mario, my friend,
 look me in the eye.

530
01:03:27,713 --> 01:03:29,792
 You're the one
 getting into the ring.

531
01:03:29,793 --> 01:03:32,793
 You're the one
 who's going to get hurt.

532
01:03:33,593 --> 01:03:35,592
 lf you get up there,

533
01:03:35,593 --> 01:03:37,792
 the champ will break
 some of your ribs,

534
01:03:37,793 --> 01:03:40,793
 a bone... He'll have you
 on your back in thirty seconds.

535
01:03:42,033 --> 01:03:44,392
 There'll be no 1 ,000 dollars

536
01:03:44,393 --> 01:03:47,393
 and you may have to spend
 more than that on doctors.

537
01:03:47,873 --> 01:03:50,872
 Who'll run the business
 while you're in hospital?

538
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:53,873
 To say nothing of the shame,
 being made a fool of.

539
01:03:56,113 --> 01:03:57,832
 You said if l got up there
 on Saturday...

540
01:03:57,833 --> 01:04:00,592
 l said?

541
01:04:00,593 --> 01:04:03,593
 l think l gave you some advice.

542
01:04:05,073 --> 01:04:08,073
 At any rate,
 if you withdraw from the challenge,

543
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:12,472
 there could be a deal,
 some compensation.

544
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:15,192
 -How much?
 -Chief,

545
01:04:15,193 --> 01:04:17,712
 pour a drink for us both.

546
01:04:17,713 --> 01:04:20,713
 l'm buying, of course.
 Whatever you like.

547
01:04:33,873 --> 01:04:35,472
 Cheers, Mario.

548
01:04:35,473 --> 01:04:38,392
 He doesn't drink.

549
01:04:38,393 --> 01:04:41,393
 Adriana, l do drink vermouth.

550
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:44,752
 Mario, my friend, let's continue.

551
01:04:44,753 --> 01:04:47,753
 Friend Mario and l
 already talked about tomorrow.

552
01:04:48,313 --> 01:04:51,313
 1 ,000 dollars, exactly.
 We're not going to lose it.

553
01:04:51,993 --> 01:04:53,912
 -Mario, we're closing.
 -The grass,

554
01:04:53,913 --> 01:04:56,152
 l have to haul the grass down.

555
01:04:56,153 --> 01:04:59,153
 lf you don't go tomorrow,
 everyone will know you're afraid.

556
01:05:00,073 --> 01:05:03,073
 l'll tell them,
 house by house, person by person.

557
01:05:04,153 --> 01:05:06,952
 Just a second, Mario.

558
01:05:06,953 --> 01:05:08,752
 l thought about that too.

559
01:05:08,753 --> 01:05:11,753
 About comments around town
 if you don't go to the Apollo.

560
01:05:13,433 --> 01:05:16,433
 But it can all be sorted out.
 Suppose you do climb into the ring.

561
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:20,873
 Don't get the champ mad,
 because that'd ruin our plans.

562
01:05:21,233 --> 01:05:24,192
 You'll soon see
 what the champ can do

563
01:05:24,193 --> 01:05:27,193
 and you'll be on your back,
 without a scratch.

564
01:05:27,233 --> 01:05:29,352
 l get it.
 l go and l lose. How much?

565
01:05:29,353 --> 01:05:32,353
 How much? Let's say 100,

566
01:05:33,793 --> 01:05:36,312
 -200...
 -1 ,000.

567
01:05:36,313 --> 01:05:38,232
 1 ,000 dollars.

568
01:05:38,233 --> 01:05:40,912
 We need the money
 and he'll win clean on Saturday.

569
01:05:40,913 --> 01:05:43,913
 No tricks, no deals.

570
01:05:44,313 --> 01:05:47,312
 People will be proud of him.
 My husband's no idiot.

571
01:05:47,313 --> 01:05:50,112
 No one's stronger than him.
 No one can beat him,

572
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:53,113
 especially not that old man,
 however much of a champion he was.

573
01:05:54,873 --> 01:05:57,752
 Mario, let's close up now.

574
01:05:57,753 --> 01:06:00,753
 Miss, l'm getting tired of you.
 l came to warn my friend Mario

575
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:03,512
 of the danger he's in.
 And l will not be pressured!

576
01:06:03,513 --> 01:06:06,513
 You don't know
 what you're talking about.

577
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:08,232
 You made a public challenge,

578
01:06:08,233 --> 01:06:10,432
 and the money had better
 be there tomorrow!

579
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:13,032
 -Mario, we're closing!
 -l have to haul the grass.

580
01:06:13,033 --> 01:06:16,033
 Then haul it!

581
01:15:26,593 --> 01:15:29,593
 Prost.

582
01:18:29,593 --> 01:18:32,232
 -Yes?
 -Did you miss the bus?

583
01:18:32,233 --> 01:18:34,872
 Or don 't you even have
 the money for tickets?

584
01:18:34,873 --> 01:18:37,873
 -What are you still doing here?
 -The fight's on.

585
01:18:39,073 --> 01:18:42,073
 -What?
 -You heard me.

586
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:45,833
 -When do we see the money?
 -There's been a change of plan.

587
01:18:46,993 --> 01:18:49,432
 The money will be handed in
 tonight at the Apollo.

588
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:52,272
 But that wasn 't the deal.

589
01:18:52,273 --> 01:18:55,273
 Forget the deal.
 l'll take the money myself.

590
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:58,632
 ln case the Turk's hospital bills
 have to be paid.

591
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:01,633
 A funeral you'll have to pay if
 you don 't come up with the money.

592
01:19:01,953 --> 01:19:03,672
 Be careful, Prince.

593
01:19:03,673 --> 01:19:06,673
 People don 't like being tricked.

594
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:22,713
 He's buying.

595
01:19:23,313 --> 01:19:26,313
 -Cheers.
 -Cheers.

596
01:19:29,953 --> 01:19:32,953
 -Do you want to play?
 -Yeah, sure. Why not?

597
01:19:34,753 --> 01:19:37,753
 -What are the stakes?
 -20 pesos a chip.

598
01:19:37,913 --> 01:19:40,913
 Fine.

599
01:20:02,953 --> 01:20:05,953
 Gentlemen, why don't we get serious?

600
01:20:06,553 --> 01:20:09,553
 What do you say to 50?

601
01:20:09,913 --> 01:20:12,792
 Fine by me.

602
01:20:12,793 --> 01:20:15,793
 What are you drinking? Grappa?

603
01:20:16,233 --> 01:20:19,233
 My friend,
 a bottle of grappa, please.

604
01:20:21,673 --> 01:20:23,232
 Here from the Apollo,

605
01:20:23,233 --> 01:20:25,832
 we're broadcasting
 one of Santa María's biggest,

606
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:27,632
 most important sporting events.

607
01:20:27,633 --> 01:20:29,752
 The challenger's brute strength

608
01:20:29,753 --> 01:20:32,753
 versus the champion's skill.

609
01:20:56,793 --> 01:20:59,793
 Cheers.

610
01:21:04,713 --> 01:21:07,152
 Sorry, friend.
 You know what they say:

611
01:21:07,153 --> 01:21:10,153
 lf you're out of luck,
 don't go fishing.

612
01:21:11,753 --> 01:21:14,753
 -The bottle. Can we drink that?
 -Yes, of course.

613
01:21:16,433 --> 01:21:19,433
 Let's cut the small change.
 Two hundred?

614
01:21:22,873 --> 01:21:25,873
 Fine.

615
01:21:41,473 --> 01:21:44,473
 Our dear friend Alcides now

616
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:46,552
 with his accordion,

617
01:21:46,553 --> 01:21:49,553
 playing a beautiful melody.

618
01:22:34,633 --> 01:22:37,633
 Are you alright?

619
01:22:37,993 --> 01:22:40,792
 Are you alright?

620
01:22:40,793 --> 01:22:43,672
 You want to stop?

621
01:22:43,673 --> 01:22:45,472
 No.

622
01:22:45,473 --> 01:22:48,473
 500 more.

623
01:23:35,553 --> 01:23:38,553
 Listen, tomorrow l'll come
 and pay for the round.

624
01:23:51,673 --> 01:23:54,673
 Ever since you came in
 l've wanted to ask you...

625
01:23:56,673 --> 01:23:59,673
 Grappa,
 is it better here, or in Europe?

626
01:24:12,153 --> 01:24:14,792
 l'll go find him.

627
01:24:14,793 --> 01:24:17,793
 No. Stay here until l say.

628
01:24:58,633 --> 01:25:00,632
 236?

629
01:25:00,633 --> 01:25:03,633
 There are 400 people at least.
 How can that be?

630
01:25:05,753 --> 01:25:08,753
 They sneak in.

631
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:00,512
 The lights go down now,
 ladies and gentlemen,

632
01:27:00,513 --> 01:27:03,513
 and coming out is Prince Orsini.

633
01:27:04,073 --> 01:27:07,073
 Thank you.

634
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:14,993
 Thank you, good evening,

635
01:27:15,113 --> 01:27:17,472
 and welcome to
 this extraordinary event.

636
01:27:17,473 --> 01:27:18,432
 Today...

637
01:27:18,433 --> 01:27:21,433
 you'll witness a unique
 event for your beautiful city.

638
01:27:22,113 --> 01:27:25,113
 The man about to come out is
 the top wrestler of his generation,

639
01:27:26,713 --> 01:27:29,713
 from the finest
 wrestling school in history,

640
01:27:30,393 --> 01:27:33,393
 World Heavyweight Champion,
 Golden Medal at the Spartakiada,

641
01:27:34,273 --> 01:27:37,273
 before being rescued
 from the claws of communism.

642
01:27:37,713 --> 01:27:40,713
 Ladies and gentlemen,
 a big hand for the World Champion,

643
01:27:41,273 --> 01:27:44,273
 Jacob Van Oppen!

644
01:27:55,593 --> 01:27:58,593
 And now, the challenger,

645
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:01,873
 a brave man who has put his life
 in the clutches of the champion

646
01:28:02,593 --> 01:28:05,593
 for a prize of...

647
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:08,713
 1 ,000 dollars!

648
01:28:10,273 --> 01:28:13,273
 1 ,000 dollars!

649
01:28:21,553 --> 01:28:24,553
 This brave man is the Turk,

650
01:28:25,193 --> 01:28:28,193
 Mario Porfilio!

651
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:48,753
 What are you doing there?
 Come on! Get out!

652
01:28:52,873 --> 01:28:55,873
 Turk! Turk!

653
01:29:15,593 --> 01:29:18,312
 The Turk, loudly applauded

654
01:29:18,313 --> 01:29:21,313
 and supported by the crowd...

655
01:29:21,953 --> 01:29:24,953
 Now let's hand it over
 to the gladiators.

656
01:31:12,953 --> 01:31:15,953
 Your arms!
 Lower your arms!

657
01:31:16,473 --> 01:31:19,473
 What is he doing? lsn't this illegal?

658
01:31:41,473 --> 01:31:44,473
 Lower your arms! Lower them!

659
01:34:20,593 --> 01:34:23,593
 Get up!

660
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:29,953
 Get up!

661
01:34:32,913 --> 01:34:35,913
 Get up!

662
01:34:44,113 --> 01:34:47,113
 DOCTORS ROOM

663
01:34:57,873 --> 01:34:58,832
 So?

664
01:34:58,833 --> 01:35:01,632
 Pulse, breathing
 and cyanosis improved.

665
01:35:01,633 --> 01:35:03,552
 Sporadic recovery of lucidity.

666
01:35:03,553 --> 01:35:06,553
 As for brain recovery,
 we'll have to wait.

667
01:35:06,713 --> 01:35:09,713
 Dimas came a while ago. Can l go?

668
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:13,833
 -Yeah, sure.
 -See you.

669
01:35:16,313 --> 01:35:17,952
 Brother,

670
01:35:17,953 --> 01:35:20,912
 don't give me that false modesty.

671
01:35:20,913 --> 01:35:23,913
 lf that brute hasn't died yet,
 he never will.

672
01:35:23,953 --> 01:35:25,792
 You did it, boss.

673
01:35:25,793 --> 01:35:28,793
 The best doctors in the capital
 couldn't have done better.

674
01:36:27,353 --> 01:36:30,353
 How is he?

675
01:36:32,393 --> 01:36:35,393
 Alive.

676
01:36:38,033 --> 01:36:40,792
 l was going to have a baby.

677
01:36:40,793 --> 01:36:43,793
 Now l'm going to have to
 look after two.

678
01:36:47,793 --> 01:36:50,793
 May l?

679
01:36:59,193 --> 01:37:02,193
 You should quit smoking.
