1
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,133
All right, get them!

2
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,844
Damned Indian.

3
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,947
He's still on ourt rail.

4
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,790
Stupid, you're simply
wasting your fire.

5
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,127
Go ahead, Jim.

6
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,027
You know what to do.

7
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,934
Go over that way.

8
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,530
Why didn't you let me handle it?

9
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,598
One shot and I'd have
finished him off.

10
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,803
By this time I'd already be bringing
you back his scalp.

11
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,342
Maybe he would've had yours.

12
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,378
You're just too stupid.

13
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,613
You're real smart, brother,
aren't you?

14
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,842
Just like a true half-breed.

15
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,676
Be careful, brother.

16
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,914
I won't ever let anyone call
me a bastard.

17
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,786
Hey, look over there!

18
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,364
Look at that, Duncan.

19
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,238
They got a price on your head,
your brother's too.

20
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,811
Dirty cowards.

21
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,247
We come to sell scalps and that's
the welcome we get.

22
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,305
Yeah, they're crazy.

23
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,939
The sheriff must have
made a mistake.

24
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,213
Yeah, well then, we'll just have
to set him straight.

25
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,887
Two hundred, Jeffrey, that's more...

26
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,891
than you're worth.

27
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,158
Hey, don't throw it away, Duncan.

28
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,630
We'll set fire to the whole town
with that piece of paper.

29
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,132
We're gonna have a little fun.

30
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,207
They're really gonna pay for this.

31
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,214
We'll show them all right,
won't we boys?

32
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:51,850
Come on.

33
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,880
Hey, one minute there.

34
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,888
No, no. You got to check
your guns first!

35
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,584
You must be joking, with all those
tough characters in there.

36
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,194
Hey, mister, don't get excited. You
can keep us as hostages.

37
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,058
-What good will that do?
-Plenty.

38
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,132
If you pull up a couple of
chairs for us...

39
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,133
then we can keep you company, huh?

40
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,361
You wouldn't want to keep us
standing here, would you?

41
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,805
All right. I'll get a few chairs.

42
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,042
Thank you.

43
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,377
No, afteryou.

44
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,025
<i>What's going on?</i>

45
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,702
Well, come on, boys.

46
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,501
This friendly little visit
isn't over yet.

47
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:49,606
I have an idea.

48
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,110
We'll have to give this town a reason
for collecting that reward.

49
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,727
We didn't do it. It was
the sheriff's idea.

50
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:16,094
The sheriff, huh? Where is he?
I'd like to speak to him.

51
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,362
I'm right over here, Duncan.

52
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,068
What do you think you're doing?

53
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,697
Just why have you come here?

54
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,243
You know damn well.

55
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,143
We've been bringing you lndian
scalps for years.

56
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,440
You paid us good then, Sheriff.

57
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,808
That ain't against the law.

58
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,076
What's happened?

59
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,446
Those days are through.

60
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,646
The scalps you brought then were
those of troublemakers.

61
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,357
Now you're attacking peaceful
tribes, killing...

62
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,360
even the women and the children.

63
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,459
This is murder, Duncan, and
I must forbid it.

64
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:49,398
All lndians are the same to me,
a bunch of red bastards.

65
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,629
Show him the scalps, Monkey.

66
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,232
Here.

67
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,110
And there's more where
these came from.

68
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,844
Now, listen to me, Duncan.
I've warned you.

69
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,416
No sale! Just come along with us.

70
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,353
Duncan, I'm arresting
you for murder.

71
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,581
Get up!

72
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,218
Go open up the jail, Sheriff.

73
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,331
Nice shot!

74
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,828
Your boys are in top
form, my friend.

75
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,203
Well, well. Look who's here.

76
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,201
You've changed since you were
in that rotten prison.

77
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,512
And you, you haven't
changed at all, Duncan.

78
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,477
You're still selling out cheap.

79
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,681
Still satisfied with a dollar a
scalp, like before.

80
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,993
It's a personal hobby.

81
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,354
And what about you?

82
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,464
You still make a living out of
saving helpless women?

83
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,833
No. I'm also a doctor, remember?

84
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,666
And now I've gotten started in...

85
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,036
banking.

86
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,906
Banking?

87
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,874
The name Blackwood mean
anything to you?

88
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,341
Sure.

89
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,144
They're rich. The ones that own
the bank in town.

90
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,585
But I don't think they mean
anything to you.

91
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,656
They mean a great deal.

92
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,020
Blackwood's a banker and I've
married his daughter.

93
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,649
You don't say?

94
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:22,894
I'm pretty influential now.

95
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,019
How about putting me on
the payroll, amigo?

96
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,564
Well, I just might have an
opening for a teller.

97
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,692
Look, I have a proposition that
might interest you.

98
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,930
There's a train due to arrive
in Esperanza...

99
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,939
with half a million dollars
on board.

100
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,167
All you have to do is
hold up the train.

101
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,608
When the job is done, both
of us will be rich.

102
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,009
Or I'd be rich alone.

103
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,705
No, don't count on it.

104
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,783
You can't do it without me,
my friend.

105
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,284
That money is locked up in
an armored safe.

106
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,513
lf you're thinking of using
dynamite charges,...

107
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:53,058
you'd blow up the safe, all right,
and the money along with it.

108
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,285
But I know the combination
on the lock,...

109
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,123
so I could open it nice and easy.

110
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,289
Hold up that train and then meet
me at Hot Springs.

111
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,300
I'll be there tomorrow.

112
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,166
You won't have to run around chasing
these stinking lndians anymore,

113
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,967
just for a few lousy dollars.

114
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,970
And I'll be able to get the hell
out of this miserable town

115
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,840
and head back to Europe.

116
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,414
You must really be in love
with your wife.

117
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:17,914
Of course I am.

118
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,646
It's easy to love a woman who's
such a solid investment.

119
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,756
But as far as the pleasures of
matrimony are concerned,

120
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,757
well, that's another story.

121
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,519
-That's it.
-Come on!

122
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,722
Let them fight!

123
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,562
Come on!

124
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,297
Come on, girls. Hurry up!
Get up there!

125
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,497
Don't let those girls get away.

126
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,801
Larry, stop them!

127
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,138
-Right, Duncan.
-Make it fast.

128
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,075
You boys come with me.

129
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,980
Hey, boys, let's go! Get
on those horses.

130
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,779
We got to stop them.

131
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,051
Don't let those girls get away!

132
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,911
Duncan, wait. That lndian!

133
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,510
He got two more of our men.

134
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,953
Come on, we'll finish him
off this time.

135
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,753
Later. We've got something else
to take care of now.

136
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,068
Geraldine's been hit!

137
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:00,403
You saved our lives, mister.
We're very grateful.

138
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,948
Don't think that we'll forget what
you've done for us.

139
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,607
I didn't kill them for you.

140
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:09,153
Listen, mister, in Pyote, we overheard
Duncan and a man from Esperanza...

141
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,779
gabbing about some train robbery
they're setting up.

142
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,551
Geraldine could recognize
the other fellow,...

143
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,954
but they shot her.

144
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,153
It's the train that passes
through Esperanza.

145
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,524
They've about half a
million dollars...

146
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,531
onboard in one of the cars.

147
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,567
The bandits have arranged to meet
back in Hot Springs.

148
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,365
There's still time to stop
that train.

149
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,297
Here. There's a chance
you can help.

150
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,775
I don't know. Just why do I have
to take that chance?

151
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,107
It's a long ways to ride.

152
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,047
Maybe I'll go back.

153
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,050
Now, get to Esperanza.

154
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,982
Let's go!

155
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,885
We've got to get back to a doctor.
She's bleeding a lot.

156
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,017
Dear, dear. Hush.

157
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,554
I know I'm going to love
this country.

158
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,154
How beautiful the mountains are.

159
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,561
Do you think he'll like it,
too? I'll let...

160
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,566
the little fellow have a look.

161
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,829
I'm sure he'll love it here.

162
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,839
-King!
-Jack!

163
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,466
I'm through.

164
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,605
You've cleaned me out.

165
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,805
Never mind that.

166
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,280
You can help yourself from
that safe inside.

167
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,918
-It's your turn.
-That's yours, Bill.

168
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,674
Stop! Stop the train!

169
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,444
-What for?
-Logs! They're blocking the track!

170
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,382
Brake, damn it! Brake!

171
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,688
-Give me a hand.
-Hold on, I'm coming.

172
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,060
Look at that.

173
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,828
That was a close one.

174
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,164
Hey, give me a hand here.

175
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,272
-What happened?
-Can't you see for yourself?

176
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,904
-Watch out.
-What did we stop for?

177
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,678
There's some logs on the tracks.
We have to clear them off.

178
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,753
Oh, it's all right.

179
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,786
Robledo, halt!

180
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:36,171
Well, looks as though the
man wasn't lying.

181
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,501
You can smell those dollars.

182
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,748
Now all we gotta do is wait
for our friend.

183
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,946
Search all the carriages. Make
sure we got everybody.

184
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,817
Cover the other side.

185
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,655
Don't cry. Don't cry.

186
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:57,955
No!

187
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,664
We said no witnesses, remember?

188
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,628
You boys better decide what
to do with the kid.

189
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,051
-Everything's quiet so far.
-Good.

190
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,883
Change the guard every two hours.

191
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,890
-You understand?
-Right.

192
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,689
I'm gonna go
on a drunk for a month...

193
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,695
with my cut of the money.

194
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,629
I'm gonna buy me a ranch and breed
me some horses.

195
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,997
Well, there's no sense
speculating now.

196
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:40,037
We can make our plans when our
friend comes tomorrow.

197
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,072
Just tell me one thing. Why do we
have to wait around?

198
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,903
Why couldn't he come and open
the safe tonight?

199
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,170
It'd be too risky.

200
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,475
He's too well known around here.
He has to have an alibi.

201
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,310
Just shut up and go to sleep!

202
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,301
Hey, you got a match?

203
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,938
What's the matter?

204
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,746
Yeah, hey, listen a minute.

205
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,882
Could you please tell us where
we could find a doctor?

206
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,351
Dr. Lynne's at the station
with the others.

207
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,888
Then please take us to the station.

208
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,050
Citizens of Esperanza, we have
assembled here to welcome

209
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,252
a very special train that will be...

210
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,262
arriving with its precious load.

211
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,732
I hope you know how precious.

212
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:05,063
You're all quite aware what
it means to us all

213
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,298
to receive this grant of $500,000
from our state.

214
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,141
This gift offers all of us
definite advantages.

215
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:17,371
And all this will mean a great
deal to our town.

216
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,707
And may we now acknowledge
the efforts

217
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,616
of our distinguished mayor,
Mr. Jefferson Clay,...

218
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,087
to whom we sincerely offer our thanks,
and we are also very grateful to

219
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,557
Sheriffs Reagan and Johnson
for their aid.

220
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:32,754
Our appreciation also goes to the
manager of our local bank,

221
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:35,832
Mr. Oliver Blackwood, and to
his daughter, Hannah,

222
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:40,267
beloved wife of our very competent
and highly esteemed Dr. Lynne.

223
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,100
Whoa! Whoa, there!

224
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,902
Hurry. Help me, Maria!

225
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,579
-Gently.
-Easy now.

226
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,384
Be careful.

227
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,077
And we are very proud of
all you've done.

228
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,288
Reverend Rattigan!

229
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,448
What's the matter, Estella?

230
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,525
We need the doctor now! A
girI's been wounded.

231
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,425
-Let them through.
-Oh, the poor girl.

232
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,723
-Clear the way.
-What happened?

233
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,231
Put her in that room.

234
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,427
-Yes.
-Hannah, get my bag, quickly.

235
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,199
You find it, Estella. He put it in
the carriage out front.

236
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,505
I can hardly believe what I saw.
Those men are ruthless.

237
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,444
First, they terrorized Pyote,
then they tried to kill us.

238
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,037
Now calm down.

239
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,117
You're in no danger here.

240
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,585
The train will get here in a little
while with an armed escort.

241
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,815
The soldiers will defend us.

242
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,516
Don't worry about Geraldine.

243
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,389
There couldn't be a better man
than Dr. Lynne.

244
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:13,964
Let's pray there's still time to
save her, poor child.

245
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,071
Hemostat.

246
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,045
But who was
this other man?

247
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:32,241
I don't know. From where I was hiding
it was impossible to see his face.

248
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,478
Geraldine's the only one of us that
managed to get a good look at him.

249
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,110
She could recognize him.

250
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,813
Oh, no, it's you.

251
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,221
The man I saw in the saloon.

252
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,390
Oh, you...

253
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,030
No!

254
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,808
It's too late.

255
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:21,164
Let's go now.

256
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,406
Geraldine.

257
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,863
Hey, there's nobody on the train.

258
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,340
Who's that?

259
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,270
Who are you?

260
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:10,438
What are you doing here?

261
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,906
Answer me!

262
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,880
Who are you?

263
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,349
I brought you a train.

264
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,580
Yes. Yes, but why? What happened?

265
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,881
It's already cost many lives.

266
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:27,987
To try and save your lives, I
had to take the train.

267
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,092
Duncan's riding here.

268
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,191
With all of his men.

269
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,791
Wait.

270
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:37,929
How did you get it?

271
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,468
By stealing the train.

272
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,537
I told you.

273
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,401
Where is the money?

274
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,764
There, the train.

275
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,702
Come on, we'll make sure.

276
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,886
The safe should be in here.

277
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,421
Easy.

278
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,929
I'll open it.

279
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,846
Looks all right so far.

280
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:28,616
It's all here.

281
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,348
Then we should take it to the bank
as quickly as possible.

282
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,981
Well, it looks as though that man
was telling the truth.

283
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:38,095
lf Duncan comes after that money,
we don't stand a chance.

284
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,697
I don't think he'd dare come here.

285
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,823
And besides, there's the telegraph
if we need assistance.

286
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,959
Mr. Clay! Mr. Clay!

287
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,673
Somebody's cut the telegraph wires.

288
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,370
The line went dead, just as I was
receiving a message from Wellington.

289
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,774
They reported that Duncan and
his men completely...

290
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,779
destroyed the town of Pyote.

291
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,075
We gotta do something quickly...

292
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:00,047
or those bandits are going to
do the same to us.

293
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,352
Well, what can we do?

294
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,253
You realize now it's impossible
to call for any help.

295
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,756
But we can't just wait around until
those bandits ride in and kill us.

296
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,258
You've got to organize some sort
of defense, Sheriff.

297
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,197
There doesn't seem to be much we
can do, Mrs. Lynne.

298
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:14,994
You know perfectly well
we're not equipped

299
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,361
to stop Duncan and his gang.

300
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:20,563
We here in Esperanza, thank God,
are a peaceful community.

301
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,696
There's not a gun in town.

302
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,403
We're totally helpless.

303
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,841
You shouldn't give up so easily.

304
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,974
There's one way to get rid
of your problem.

305
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,176
What?

306
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:36,653
Kill him.

307
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,517
Sure. Why didn't we think of that?

308
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,750
This is no time to be making jokes.

309
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:44,123
Who do you suppose would be able
to kill that renegade?

310
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,821
Me.

311
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,065
For a price.

312
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,860
We don't make bargains
with lndians.

313
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:50,934
He's crazy.

314
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,434
Come on, we're wasting time
just listening to him.

315
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,062
But we still haven't decided
what to do.

316
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,141
Enough of this ridiculous talk.

317
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,641
Let's get that money out of here.

318
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,541
-And take it down to the bank.
-Just a minute.

319
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,342
This young man has just said that
he is willing to help us out.

320
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:08,248
It hardly seems that we're in any
position to refuse his proposal.

321
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,115
What are your terms?

322
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,559
I want a dollar a head

323
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,992
from every man in this town...

324
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,030
for every bandit I kill.

325
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:25,233
Plus the reward that's been offered
for Duncan and his brother.

326
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,736
Who do you think you're fooling?

327
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,433
You're stupid to trust him.

328
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:34,109
Nobody here is impressed
by all your boasting.

329
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:35,740
Get moving, lndian.

330
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:36,972
I said, get moving.

331
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,242
Why don't you try and move me?

332
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,373
Someone in your town helped
Duncan rob that train.

333
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,611
He's working with him.

334
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,840
He betrayed all of you once,...

335
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,146
and he could do it again.

336
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,634
You boys defend the train.

337
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,007
I'll go to Wellington to
ask for help.

338
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,105
We will need you to take care
of the wounded.

339
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,047
Let the sheriff go.

340
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,816
For my sake.

341
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,910
No, my dear, there's too
much at stake,

342
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:54,286
and I feel it is my duty to
go to Wellington.

343
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,822
I'll start right away.

344
00:40:56,687 --> 00:41:00,316
Dust thou art, and to dust
thou shalt return.

345
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:04,350
Grant unto thy servant Geraldine
eternal rest, O Lord.

346
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:05,820
-Amen.
-Amen.

347
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,225
Chester.

348
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,360
Please be careful, darling.

349
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,892
Don't worry.

350
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,232
I'll be back.

351
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:32,119
I hope he makes it. He's
taking a big risk.

352
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,921
lf Dr. Lynne doesn't get here in
time with those men,

353
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,755
it'll be a massacre.

354
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,956
ln the meanwhile,...

355
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,962
just what are we going to do?

356
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,666
What are you complaining about?

357
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,371
You sent away the only man that
could've been helpful.

358
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,997
-That lndian? He was just a liar.
-Oh, yeah?

359
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,269
Well, if you had seen him kill those
three bandits the way I did,

360
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,106
you wouldn't speak that way.

361
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:59,376
Maybe it was a big mistake to
send that boy away.

362
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,981
Let's ask him to come back.
There's still time.

363
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,576
What do you want?

364
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,043
I said, what do you want?

365
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,920
My mistress sent me to see you.

366
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,498
Who is your mistress?

367
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,237
Dr. Lynne's wife.

368
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,573
Her father is the banker
of Esperanza.

369
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,649
But she's the one who
decides everything.

370
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,015
She thinks since you saved her
father's money once,

371
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,247
perhaps you can do it again.

372
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,256
She'll do anything you want.

373
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,419
And he'll pay the price you ask.

374
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,797
How did you know I was here?

375
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:57,059
I just thought you might be.

376
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,968
Who's lndian? Your father
or your mother?

377
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,805
My mother.

378
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,339
You're a Navajo, aren't you?

379
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,645
What's your name?

380
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:18,946
Joe.

381
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,985
I've never known an lndian
named Joe.

382
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,762
And I've never seen a Navajo
so far south before.

383
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:32,164
And me, an lndian girl that asks
so many questions.

384
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:44,208
Go back and tell your mistress that
I'll save her money for her.

385
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:46,640
One more thing.

386
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,212
I'll need some dynamite.

387
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,679
Don't shoot, Duncan!

388
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,785
I wanna talk to you.

389
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,653
Come here. I think you owe me
a few explanations.

390
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,119
What's to explain?

391
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:34,255
How that lndian scum filched the
train right from under you.

392
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,696
And now the $500,000 has
been locked...

393
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,701
up in the bank vault.

394
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:41,828
-That damned dirty lndian!
-Calm down, Duncan.

395
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,236
You can still help.

396
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,072
They're running around like a pack
of scared rabbits in town.

397
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:50,646
They think I've gone to Wellington
for help.

398
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,942
So what?

399
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,011
So you capture me...

400
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,546
and you take me to Esperanza.

401
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,488
We go to the bank, and you force
me to open the safe.

402
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,616
The money's there in the bank.

403
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,888
I know how to open the door.

404
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,587
Then you can give me my share.

405
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:08,891
Okay.

406
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,325
But be careful.

407
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,529
This is your last chance.

408
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,327
You sure he'll come?

409
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,928
What did he tell you, Estella?

410
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,570
What'll we do if he doesn't
show up?

411
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,109
Things will be just as bad
as before.

412
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,840
They'll be worse.

413
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,574
Damned lndian.

414
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,013
Do you think he'll come?

415
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,051
That's enough!

416
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,622
We can fight them ourselves!

417
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,996
All right, get up. We'll show them!

418
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,431
Go ahead.

419
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,802
Besides, we don't know if that
lndian's telling the truth.

420
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,202
It could be a trap.

421
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:26,174
Wait a second. Didn't he bring
us the money?

422
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,007
She's right.

423
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,705
I'm sure that Chester will make
it to Wellington.

424
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:33,112
And he'll come back here
with the Rangers.

425
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:35,685
Meanwhile, trust the lndian.
He'll guard us.

426
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,783
All by himself? An lndian?

427
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:40,823
Time was when we'd pay a
dollar for his scalp.

428
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,551
No, we need the Rangers.

429
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,285
Don't count on that.

430
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,956
They won't come.

431
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,334
Your man took the wrong way.

432
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,129
What do you mean?

433
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:54,968
You'll see.

434
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:59,241
I know that I'm the man you need.

435
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:17,692
And you're absolutely sure you can
fight that gang alone?

436
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:21,025
We won't be able to help you
at all, don't forget.

437
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,870
Aman who knows what he wants...

438
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,231
is worth a lot.

439
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,067
Well then, what do you want?

440
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,643
I told you, a dollar a head.

441
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,876
All right. You'll defend us.

442
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,316
And one other thing.

443
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:49,655
You the sheriff?

444
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,351
No, the deputy.

445
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,554
He's the sheriff.

446
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:55,856
What do you want?

447
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:07,776
-That.
-What?

448
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:11,509
You want us to appoint you as
sheriff, is that it?

449
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,383
That's right.

450
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:16,816
But you can't.

451
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,615
An lndian sheriff?

452
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:22,188
The only ones elected in this
country are Americans.

453
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:25,159
My father was born here,
in the mountains.

454
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,364
His father before him and
his father before him

455
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,264
and his father before him.

456
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,459
Where was your father born?

457
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,729
But what has that to do with it?

458
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,673
I said, where was he born?

459
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:37,935
In Scotland.

460
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,441
My father was born here,
in America.

461
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,479
And his father before him and
his father before him

462
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,638
and his father before him.

463
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,980
Now, which of us is American?

464
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,487
And that's mine.

465
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,282
It belongs to me.

466
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,984
Thanks.

467
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,351
-All right?
-Good.

468
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,297
Go home and stay there...

469
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:03,194
and keep out of my way.

470
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,599
Get me some dynamite.

471
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,708
Then I'll tell you what to
do with the money.

472
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,686
They're coming now.
The rotten filth.

473
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:11,889
Girls, don't move. Duncan's
in town.

474
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:13,791
lf he sees us, we're as
good as dead.

475
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:23,803
Good Lord!

476
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:27,708
Why, it was utter insanity to rely
on that lndian.

477
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:32,307
I hope Chester gets to Wellington.

478
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,915
By now, it's our only chance.

479
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,486
I don't know. Let's pray.

480
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,475
No tricks, Duncan.

481
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,418
Don't worry. You'll
get your half.

482
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:10,867
All right, where's the money?

483
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:13,467
Or were you lying all along?

484
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,874
I swear. It was here.

485
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,438
I don't understand.

486
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:21,484
-I saw it.
-You're a liar! Where's the money?

487
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,984
They must've hidden it somewhere.
But I'll find it.

488
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:25,679
Where is the money?

489
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:28,053
-I tell you, I don't know.
-Where's the money?

490
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:30,592
My wife will know where they hid
it. Give me time to talk to her.

491
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:35,989
Chester!

492
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:37,997
No! Oh, Chester.

493
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,762
No, ma'am, you must not go.

494
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,394
-No.
-Stay inside.

495
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:42,800
Chester!

496
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,502
Chester, no.

497
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:02,956
Darling.

498
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,161
Chester, the lndian has it all.

499
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,328
He hid it.

500
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:09,524
It's my fault.

501
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,157
-I gave it to him.
-So, all the money is with the lndian?

502
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:14,065
Forgive me, darling.

503
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,559
-Come here.
-No, let me go. No.

504
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:13,452
No, let me go.

505
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,655
Joe! Please help me.

506
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,663
Hey, lndian! Come out!

507
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,670
Come on out, do you hear me?

508
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,139
Throw your gun down, or I'm
gonna kill this woman.

509
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:27,267
-Can you see her?
-No!

510
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,935
She's an lndian like you are.

511
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:30,613
Get down here fast, redskin,
if you...

512
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,081
don't want this squaw to die.

513
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:42,449
What are you waiting for?
Slaughter him!

514
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:46,578
You hear me? Slaughter him.
He's got to talk.

515
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,142
You damned lndian.

516
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:14,048
Where did you put all that money?

517
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:15,307
Speak up!

518
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,151
You'll end up talking.

519
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:19,316
Sooner or later.

520
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:24,548
I know you'd rather get a slug,
but that's too simple.

521
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:30,856
First, you'll have to tell us where
you hid the money.

522
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,969
Now, will you talk?

523
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,343
Where's the money?

524
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,177
Talk.

525
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,013
That's enough, brother!

526
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,911
We'll never know where
the money is.

527
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:21,351
Corpses can't talk.

528
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,216
Leave him be for a while.

529
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:33,187
String him up by his feet.

530
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,848
You can get yourself a little
fresh air tonight.

531
01:00:57,787 --> 01:01:01,917
Tomorrow, after you've had a good
rest, you and me will have our talk.

532
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,671
You frightened me, girl.

533
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,845
Next time you come, let us
know that it's you.

534
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:06,084
Or you might get an arrow
through the stomach.

535
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:09,590
We have to be prepared, in case one
of Duncan's men finds us here.

536
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,660
Well, I've really had it.

537
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:13,526
Let's get out of this town.

538
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:15,654
-What are we waiting for, Chuck?
-Me, too.

539
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:17,857
Why, the people here
are all cowards.

540
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:21,733
Didn't you see? No one even tried
to save that poor lndian.

541
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,328
You didn't do anything either.

542
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:25,600
But why have you come to us?

543
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:29,072
Please, help me save him.

544
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,010
He gave himself up...

545
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:34,278
to save my life.

546
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:39,245
He saved our lives, too,
remember, Chuck?

547
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:41,346
Yeah, of course I do.

548
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:46,358
Estella's right. There must be
something we can try.

549
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:48,964
Females!

550
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:53,429
Very well then, but I'll do it alone.
This is no job for women.

551
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:23,275
What are you doing here, huh?

552
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:24,580
-Me?
-Answer me.

553
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,416
I'm taking a little walk.

554
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,888
-Here?
-Sure, I'm just crazy about horses.

555
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:31,255
And you know what? I noticed that
white one has a limp.

556
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:33,988
-Are you sure?
-Look for yourself. Look.

557
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,561
You dirty little...

558
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:46,871
Help!

559
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:51,374
Help!

560
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,990
Thank you, friend.

561
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:11,129
Thank you.

562
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:15,830
They've let the lndian get away!

563
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:34,856
They're all going
to pay for this.

564
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:43,628
Listen to what I have to say.

565
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,029
lf by noon the money
hasn't turned up,...

566
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:49,662
expect everyone to die!

567
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:53,105
That's absurd. They're all innocent.
Nobody knows where it's hidden.

568
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:55,769
Well, somebody does.
I'll be waiting.

569
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,937
For the love of God, Duncan!

570
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,605
I've warned you!

571
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,864
-I'll be leaving.
-What do you mean?

572
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:27,738
I'll just be hiding.

573
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:31,438
But I need someone to bring those men
that are guarding the corral to me.

574
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,139
But not me, huh?

575
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:35,473
Some jobs a man can't do.

576
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:39,184
But the big blonde can
do it. Maybe.

577
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:41,449
Yes, that would be exciting.

578
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,115
But I don't murder men.

579
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,453
But he said nothing of killing.

580
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,619
All you have to do is get
him to follow you.

581
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:49,424
I'll do the rest.

582
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:51,662
Just leave it to us.

583
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:09,616
But I want you to live.

584
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:12,346
Why don't you go before
it's too late?

585
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,821
I have to finish what I've started.

586
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:19,659
Why do you hate Duncan so much?

587
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:23,596
lf it's not for the money that you
kill those bandits, then why?

588
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,334
Someday when you grow up,...

589
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,596
and don't ask so many questions,...

590
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:30,331
maybe I'll tell you.

591
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,035
Well, hello.

592
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,003
What are you hanging around
the corral for?

593
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:06,165
You know it ain't allowed.

594
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:09,475
Just as I passed here, this
garter unhooked.

595
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:13,514
I'd certainly appreciate a little
friendly assistance?

596
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,343
With pleasure. I know all about
these things.

597
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:21,681
It tickles. Thanks a lot.

598
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:25,757
You certainly are one
big barrel of fun.

599
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:27,920
Let's have a little kiss for
the hero, huh?

600
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:29,963
Oh, no, no. Not here.

601
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:32,727
Why don't you come to
my cabin later?

602
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,861
Don't be late now, and bring your
buddy for my girlfriend.

603
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:37,302
Wait! Wait!

604
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:39,271
Barbara, what happened?

605
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,502
-They're coming.
-Come on.

606
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:43,876
Coming?

607
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,503
I found two girls. Come on!

608
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:46,603
What about the horses?

609
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:48,910
Let them find their own girls.

610
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,782
Here we are, beautiful.

611
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,907
Go on, move. Get!

612
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:27,254
Barbara, they did it.

613
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,618
All right.

614
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,951
You want to finish your
days as sheriff?

615
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:07,519
Or are you gonna tell me?

616
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:08,823
Where's the money?

617
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:10,898
I don't know. I swear to you.

618
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:12,398
-But you let him get away.
-I don't know.

619
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:14,230
-No, I assure you.
-Come on, you know where. Start talking.

620
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:18,102
I swear. I don't know. I swear.
I swear to you.

621
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:21,199
All I know is that the telegraph gave
the alarm for the fire at Pyote.

622
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,608
You're all in danger. The
soldiers will be here.

623
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:25,703
Then get going. Go on.

624
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:29,844
You shoot, Jeff.

625
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:54,407
Did you all hear that outside?

626
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:57,107
Now it's time for three
more of you.

627
01:11:57,212 --> 01:12:00,272
And if you don't decide to
talk, I'll kill you all.

628
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,650
One way or another.

629
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:08,621
Do you hear me?

630
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:11,455
One way or another.

631
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:13,618
Duncan, why are we
wasting time?

632
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:15,992
Let's kill them all and
get out of here.

633
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,057
Enough of this business.

634
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,157
What else can we do?

635
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,760
We better go back before the
army is all over us.

636
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:26,136
We'll leave exactly when I say
so, is that clear?

637
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:29,574
And I ain't leaving till I learn
what they did with it.

638
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:32,613
The soldiers will find a town
full of corpses.

639
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:36,310
I'm a man of God and I wouldn't
lie to save my own life.

640
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:38,886
We don't know anything about
the lndian or the money.

641
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:41,888
You've killed my daughter and
nothing matters to me anymore.

642
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,481
lf I knew anything, I'd tell you.

643
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,190
What's happening?

644
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:55,030
They've let the horses loose. And
here's a message from the lndian.

645
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:57,128
It was attached to an arrow.

646
01:12:57,673 --> 01:13:00,233
We saw shadows and we attacked,
but he got away.

647
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:01,809
But they left your horse behind.

648
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:03,377
And where's the money?

649
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,947
It says in this note. He wants
it read aloud.

650
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,811
It's addressed to your attention.

651
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,213
Where is the money?

652
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:11,013
On the locomotive.

653
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:12,175
lf he hears another shot,...

654
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:14,915
he'll get on the train and take
it away with him.

655
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:17,048
Without horses, there's no way out.

656
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:18,591
We'll see.

657
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:24,355
Jeffrey, take my horse and ride
fast to the station.

658
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:27,558
lf you find the money, blow the
train whistle three times.

659
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:31,002
Then take off alone for Hot Springs.
We'll join you with the train.

660
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:32,471
Right away.

661
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:33,708
But why just him alone?

662
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:35,401
Because I say so!

663
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:39,508
We'll wait right here.
And if it's a trap,...

664
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:42,310
and none of this is true,...

665
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:45,319
I'm gonna set the church on fire
with all of you in it.

666
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,649
But for what reason?

667
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,349
That message is proof we know
nothing about it.

668
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:52,120
Speak to your heart. l
beg this of you.

669
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:54,922
Nobody ever had mercy on me.

670
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:58,493
When I was a boy they beat me,...

671
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:00,963
even called me bastard.

672
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:03,799
I didn't cry and I couldn't
fight back.

673
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:07,066
So that began my revenge
to get back at them.

674
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:11,279
Brought out my hatred for the
lndians, like my mother.

675
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,647
And to kill white people,
like my father.

676
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:17,719
My father, a preacher like
you, a minister.

677
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:20,648
Bred by mercy.

678
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:23,455
But I got a bad break when
somebody killed him

679
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:25,219
and beat me to the punch.

680
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:57,658
The signal! He found the money.

681
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:59,556
Come on, let's get out of here.

682
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:01,253
Let's go, you guys.

683
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:03,057
Thank you, Duncan.

684
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,896
For mercy and sparing our lives.

685
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:43,398
Look at that. They're
all going away!

686
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,597
Come on, hurry.

687
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,813
-Let me on.
-Let's get up.

688
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:59,216
-Give me a hand.
-Come on.

689
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:00,550
-All right, let's go.
-Hurry up.

690
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:01,850
-Everybody on there.
-All right.

691
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,548
-Move it out. Come on.
-All right.

692
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:06,456
Make this old crate move. We
have to reach Jeffrey fast.

693
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:08,660
You heard him, boys!

694
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,584
Look! The lndian.

695
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:42,494
What is it?

696
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:44,498
-Why are you shooting?
-Duncan! The lndian!

697
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:47,830
He's in front of the train. l
recognize his horse.

698
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:52,202
Come on, feed it some coal! We're
gonna catch that pig.

699
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:54,040
Come on, move!

700
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,665
He's yours, Duncan. Get him now.

701
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:42,417
Jeffrey.

702
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,422
I got to the train,...

703
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:51,390
found the cash, but the lndian
came from behind.

704
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,089
You, Sancho, come with me.

705
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,833
Duncan, hold it a minute.

706
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:51,138
Who knows where he's hiding?

707
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:54,078
We may be walking into a trap.

708
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,241
Go on, hero. Move.

709
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:05,389
It looks like a mine.

710
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:06,989
Go on.

711
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:08,527
Both of us.

712
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,530
You dig in here. Keep a look out.

713
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,428
Nobody.

714
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:44,323
Now we got him, behind the
rocks over there.

715
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,120
Duncan,...

716
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:48,760
we're in the open here.

717
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:51,131
He'll pick us off easy.

718
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:52,631
Get moving!

719
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:55,226
But I don't want to be killed.

720
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:56,962
Move, I said.

721
01:22:57,072 --> 01:22:59,040
I'm getting out of here, and to
hell with the money!

722
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:00,232
Get back here!

723
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:02,105
Come back, you coward!

724
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:27,885
You won't escape now, redskin.

725
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:48,999
You sweating?

726
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:51,705
You all ready to give up now?
Come on out, lndian.

727
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:54,543
Come on out, you're finished.
You're through.

728
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:11,658
I'm too smart to fall
for that trick.

729
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:20,670
Come on out, lndian! It's all over.

730
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:28,374
I'll pin your scalp to my saddle!

731
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,485
That's foryou, filthy,
stinking lndian.

732
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,720
Come on, lndian. Come on out.

733
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:37,586
Or would you rather not come out
and rot for killing Jeffrey?

734
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:39,283
Damn you, lndian.

735
01:26:50,638 --> 01:26:53,004
Face it, lndian. I outsmarted you.

736
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:11,253
Throw down your belt.

737
01:27:17,999 --> 01:27:19,398
There you are.

738
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,865
You won.

739
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:22,960
You're real smart, hombre.

740
01:27:23,204 --> 01:27:24,762
Why did you follow me?

741
01:27:24,839 --> 01:27:26,864
Because you want to kill me?

742
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:30,304
I know you're a bounty killer.

743
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:35,073
You want to have my bounty. But you
can have the money, if you want.

744
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:36,808
But let me live.

745
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:39,616
You killed my brother.
Broke up my gang.

746
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:41,587
Let me live.

747
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:11,476
This belonged to my woman.

748
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:15,846
Do you remember her? Huh?

749
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:20,952
Okay.

750
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:26,062
You're gonna pay for her life.

751
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:47,539
It's our money.

752
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:49,473
The lndian kept his promise.

753
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:00,317
Where is he?

754
01:31:00,855 --> 01:31:03,517
Who cares? The money is
all that counts.

755
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:06,893
-Take his horse to the corral.
-No!

756
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:09,896
Let him go.

757
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:15,766
He knows where to go.

758
01:31:21,108 --> 01:31:22,632
Go back to him.

759
01:31:22,944 --> 01:31:24,002
Go.

760
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:26,872
Go.
