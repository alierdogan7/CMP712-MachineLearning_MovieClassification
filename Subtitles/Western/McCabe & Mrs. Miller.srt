00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:40,534
HOW DO
YOU KNOW THAT?

182
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:41,868
WHO SAID HIS NAME
WAS McCABE?

183
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:42,868
JOE SHORTREED
TOLD ME.

184
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,801
WELL, HOW DOES HE KNOW?

185
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:46,400
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS
McCABE TOLD HIM.

186
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:50,167
NOW I'VE

187
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,701
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM

188
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:53,734

189
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:56,934

I'LL SEE YOU.

194
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:14,133
YOU DIDN'T SAY
YOUR NAME WAS McCABE

195
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,133
WHEN YOU COME IN
HERE.

196
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,400
I DIDN'T SAY IT NOW.

BUSINESSMAN.

203
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:35,334
BUSINESS AIN'T
SO GOOD, IS IT?

204
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,901
DID YOU EVER KNOW
BILL ROUNDTREE?

205
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:39,400
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU, SHEEHAN?

206
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:41,767
YOU GOT A TURD IN YOUR
POCKET OR SOMETHIN'?

207
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:49,834

YOU'RE NOT QUITTIN'?

214
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:05,434
OH, NO. BE RIGHT BACK,
GENTLEMEN. RIGHT BACK.

215
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:08,167
MY GOOD MAN.

216
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:14,501
TRY NOT TO DROP
THE CARDS, EH, RONNY?

217
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,634
WHERE ARE YOU GOIN'?

218
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:36,167
NOWHERE. UH...
I WAS JUST WONDERIN'

219
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:37,300

00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:42,167
WELL, I WAS GONNA GO

221
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:44,634
OH.

222
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,167
YES, SIR. THAT'S McCABE,
ALL RIGHT. JOHN McCABE.

223
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:55,200
USED TO BE CALLED
"PUDGY" McCABE.

224
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:56,667
GOT A BIG REP.

225
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,868
I NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

226
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:59,234
WELL, HE'S GOT
A BIG REP.

227
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,033
WHY THEY CALL HIM PUDGY?
HE DON'T LOOK SO FAT.

228
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,667
HOW IN THE HELL
WOULD I KNOW?

229
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:04,167
ANYWAY, HE'S THE MAN

230
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:05,400
THAT SHOT
BILL ROUNDTREE.

231
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:06,934
I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF HIM, EITHER.

232
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,267
I'VE KNOW OF ROUNDTREE.

233
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:09,834
I CAN'T REMEMBER
FROM WHERE,

234
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:10,868
BUT I KNOW THE NAME.

235
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:12,868
WELL, HE WASN'T
NOBODY TO MESS WITH.

236
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:16,367
THAT MAN OUT THERE
TAKING A PEE SHOT HIM.

237
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:18,534
HE'S GOT A BIG REP.

238
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,467
GENTLEMEN, YOUR DEALER
IS NONE OTHER

239
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:25,033
THAN JOHN McCABE.

240
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,701
PUDGY McCABE?

241
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:29,200
THE MAN THAT SHOT
BILL ROUNDTREE.

242
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,701
HE REALLY IS
A GUNFIGHTER.

243
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:34,701
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE HELL HE IS.

244
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:36,200
HE SHOT BILL ROUNDTREE?

245
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:37,701
McCABE REALLY

246
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:39,234
I KNEW
BILL ROUNDTREE.

247
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,734
WHO IS HE?

248
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,234
HE WAS A GOVERNOR.

249
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,400
HE WAS RUNNING
FOR GOVERNOR

250
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:44,400
IN WYOMING.

251
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:46,701
JEREMY, YOU ARE
SO FULL OF SHIT.

252
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,734
DAMN. OUT THERE
KIND OF MAKES YOU FEEL

253
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:52,734
LIKE A 3-SQUIRT DOG
IN A 30-MILE WIND.

254
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:54,234
THAT EGG'S RAW, AIN'T IT?

255
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,701
YEAH.

256
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:56,834
OK.

257
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:01,567
TELL ME SOMETHING, BOYS.

258
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:04,501
WHO OWNS THE PROPERTY
AROUND HERE?

259
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:14,000
SHEEHAN OWNS ALL THE PROPERTY
THIS SIDE OF TOWN.

260
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:16,501
THE CHINESE DON'T
OWN NO PROPERTY.

261
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:17,801
THEY JUST
POACH IN MINES.

262
00:14:17,868 --> 00:14:21,434

00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,501
WELL, THESE BOYS GOT MY
TIT IN A WRINGER HERE.

00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:34,000
I HATE TO MOVE ON
WHEN I'M LOSIN'.

267
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,734
YOU CAN FLOP HERE
FOR 2 BITS A NIGHT.

268
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:37,000
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU.

269
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,434

275
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:54,534
YOU GOT MANY CHINKS

276
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:57,033
YOU JUST

277
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,534
WHO SELLS THEM
THEIR MUD, YOU?

278
00:14:58,601 --> 00:14:59,534
NOT ME.

279
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:01,033
I SELL WHISKEY.

280
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,367
I DON'T TOLERATE
OPIUM SMOKERS AROUND HERE.

281
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:07,434
WELL?

282
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,968

287
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,534
I WOULDN'T STAY UP THERE
FOR FREE

288
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:22,100
IF YOU HAD A GODDAMN
SAN FRANCISCO WHORE

289
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,534
IN EVERY BED.

290
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:25,033
GET UP, COYLE.

291
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,834
THE DEALER'S BACK.

292
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:27,834
HEY, BART.

293
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:30,334
YOU KNOW HOW
TO SQUARE A CIRCLE?

294
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,367
YOU SHOVE A 4x4
UP A MULE'S ASS.

295
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,934
SHOULD WE MAKE THIS
A QUARTER GAME NOW?

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,167
LET'S MAKE IT
A QUARTER GAME.

297
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,501
SHEEHAN, BRING THESE

298
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:50,601
* AH, YOU HATE TO WATCH

299
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,067

* LIKE HE WAS GIVING UP
THE HOLY GAME OF POKER *

301
00:15:57,501 --> 00:16:00,400
* AND WHILE HE TALKS

302
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,767
* YOU NOTICE
THERE'S A HIGHWAY *

303
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:07,534

SMOKE ABOVE HIS SHOULDER *

304
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:09,934
* AND IT'S CURLING
JUST LIKE SMOKE *

305
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,367
* ABOVE HIS SHOULDER *

306
00:16:13,968 --> 00:16:16,934
* YOU TELL HIM
TO COME IN, SIT DOWN *

307
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,167
* BUT SOMETHING
MAKES YOU TURN AROUND *

308
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:20,767
* THE DOOR IS OPEN *

309
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:24,200
* YOU CAN'T CLOSE
YOUR SHELTER *

310
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,968

DO NOT BE AFRAID *

312
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,868
* IT'S YOU, MY LOVE *

313
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:34,033

00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:46,701
* WE'D MEET BETWEEN THE
TRAINS WE'RE WAITING FOR *

319
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,534
* I THINK
IT'S TIME TO BOARD ANOTHER *

320
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:55,000
* PLEASE UNDERSTAND
I NEVER HAD A SECRET CHART *

321
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:57,367
* TO GET ME

322
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,601

AND THAT,
MY DEAR MR. McCABE,

899
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,701
IS 'CAUSE EVERY GEEZER
IN THIS TOWN

900
00:46:19,767 --> 00:46:21,901

AND DON'T GIVE ME
THEM HORSEPUCKIES

929
00:47:19,834 --> 00:47:21,033

1043
00:53:34,534 --> 00:53:36,934
AND HE LOOKED OUT
THE EAGLE'S ASS,

1044
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,934

"OH," HE SAYS,
"HOW HIGH UP ARE WE?"

YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PAY ME ANYTHING.

HARRISON SHAUGHNESSY.

1722
01:28:15,434 --> 01:28:17,267
THEY HAVE STOCKHOLDERS.

1723
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:19,267
NOW, DO YOU THINK
THEY WANT

1724
01:28:19,334 --> 01:28:21,767
THEIR STOCKHOLDERS
AND THE PUBLIC

1725
01:28:21,834 --> 01:28:23,767
THINKIN' THAT THEIR
MANAGEMENT ISN'T IMBUED

1726
01:28:23,834 --> 01:28:26,267
WITH ALL THE PRINCIPLES
OF FAIR PLAY AND JUSTICE,

1727
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:29,267
THE VERY VALUES THAT MAKE
THIS COUNTRY WHAT IT IS TODAY?

1728
01:28:29,334 --> 01:28:30,367
UH-HUH.

1729
01:28:30,434 --> 01:28:33,767
BUSTIN' UP THESE
TRUSTS AND MONOPOLIES

1730
01:28:33,834 --> 01:28:36,434
IS AT THE VERY ROOT
OF THE PROBLEM

1731
01:28:36,501 --> 01:28:38,534
OF CREATING
A JUST SOCIETY.

1732
01:28:39,901 --> 01:28:41,868
DAMN IT, McCABE,
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU

1733
01:28:41,934 --> 01:28:44,634

SYSTEM OF OURS WORKS,

AND WORKING WITHIN IT,

1735
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,067
WE CAN PROTECT
THE SMALL BUSINESSMAN

1736
01:28:48,133 --> 01:28:50,200
AND THE BIG BUSINESSMAN
AS WELL.

1737
01:28:53,534 --> 01:28:54,667
WELL, YEAH.

1738
01:28:54,734 --> 01:28:58,567
I--I JUST DIDN'T, UH,
DIDN'T WANT TO GET KILLED.

1739
01:28:58,634 --> 01:29:00,634
UNTIL PEOPLE
STOP DYIN' FOR FREEDOM,

1740
01:29:00,701 --> 01:29:02,934
THEY AIN'T
GONNA BE FREE.

1741
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,734
I CAN SEE IT NOW

1742
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:16,534
ON THE FRONT PAGE
OF THE <i>WASHINGTON POST,</i>

1743
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:19,801
RIGHT NEXT TO A PICTURE
OF WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN--

1744
01:29:19,868 --> 01:29:22,801
"McCABE STRIKES A BLOW
FOR THE LITTLE GUY."

1745
01:29:22,868 --> 01:29:24,567
OH, COME...

1746
01:29:24,634 --> 01:29:27,200
YOU'RE GONNA BECOME
A FAMOUS MAN, McCABE.

1747
01:29:27,267 --> 01:29:29,200
WE COULD FIND OURSELVES
HAVIN' DINNER

1748
01:29:29,267 --> 01:29:30,701

1749
01:29:30,767 --> 01:29:31,801
WELL, I--

01:29:33,567 --> 01:29:34,701
OH, COME ON.

1752
01:29:34,767 --> 01:29:35,801
YOU'RE GONNA
STARE 'EM DOWN

1753
01:29:35,868 --> 01:29:38,467
AND MAKE THEM
QUAKE IN THEIR BOOTS.

1754
01:29:40,767 --> 01:29:42,200
MM-HMM.

1755
01:29:42,267 --> 01:29:43,701
WELL...

1756
01:29:43,767 --> 01:29:45,701
WHA-WHAT DO WE DO?

1757
01:29:45,767 --> 01:29:48,501
WE GET THE MARSHAL
AND, UH...

1758
01:29:48,567 --> 01:29:49,667
NO?

1759
01:29:49,734 --> 01:29:51,167
WE DON'T NEED
THE MARSHAL.

1760
01:29:51,234 --> 01:29:53,734
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS
THROUGH THE COURTS.

1761
01:29:55,133 --> 01:29:57,567
WELL, THEN, UH, I GUESS
WHAT YOU'RE SAYIN'

1762
01:29:57,634 --> 01:30:01,200

1763
01:30:01,267 --> 01:30:03,901
IN THE COURTS, AND
ALL THAT, THAT, UH...

1764
01:30:03,968 --> 01:30:06,367
WELL, THEY JUST
CAN'T AFFORD TO KILL ME.

1765
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:07,868
IS, UH, THAT RIGHT?

1766
01:30:07,934 --> 01:30:09,367
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT.

1767
01:30:09,434 --> 01:30:13,000
THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO LIFT
ONE LITTLE FINGER AGAINST YOU.

1768
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,434
COMES A TIME

1769
01:30:16,501 --> 01:30:17,734
IN EVERY MAN'S LIFE,
CONSTANCE,

1770
01:30:17,801 --> 01:30:20,100
WHEN HE'S JUST GOT
TO STICK HIS HAND

1771
01:30:20,167 --> 01:30:21,234
IN THE FIRE
AND, UH...

1772
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:23,534
AND, UH, SEE WHAT
HE'S MADE OUT OF.

1773
01:30:23,601 --> 01:30:26,701
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

1774
01:30:26,767 --> 01:30:29,000
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
BUSTIN' UP THESE TRUSTS

1775
01:30:29,067 --> 01:30:30,701
AND MONOPOLIES, THAT'S
WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

1776
01:30:30,767 --> 01:30:32,200
SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO PROTECT

1777
01:30:32,267 --> 01:30:34,200
THE SMALL BUSINESSMAN
FROM THESE BIG COMPANIES,

1778
01:30:34,267 --> 01:30:35,601
AND I'M GONNA
BE THE MAN.

1779
01:30:36,834 --> 01:30:38,868
CONSTANCE, JUST 'CAUSE WE
AIN'T NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT

1780
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:42,033
DON'T MEAN I AIN'T GOT, 
UH, CERTAIN PRINCIPLES.

1781
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,801
I KNOW IT DON'T MEAN

1782
01:30:44,868 --> 01:30:46,000
BUT I GOT A REPUTATION
IN THIS TOWN. THESE P--

1789
01:30:55,934 --> 01:30:58,501
AND THEY'LL DO
SOMETHIN' AWFUL TO YOU.

01:31:08,801 --> 01:31:10,734

01:31:10,801 --> 01:31:12,734
AIN'T NOTHIN'
GONNA HAPPEN TO ME.

1792
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:14,667
DON'T GIVE ME ANY
OF THAT "LITTLE LADY" SHIT.

1793
01:31:14,734 --> 01:31:16,968
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.
JUST GIVE ME MY $1,500.

1794
01:31:17,033 --> 01:31:18,534
I WANT TO MAKE A DEAL,
AND IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE

1795
01:31:18,601 --> 01:31:20,701
A DEAL WITH 'EM, THEN
I'LL MAKE A DEAL WITH 'EM!

1796
01:31:36,567 --> 01:31:38,133
EAT YOUR MEAL.

1797
01:31:44,634 --> 01:31:46,767
YOU CAN'T MAKE NO DEAL.

1798
01:31:56,267 --> 01:31:57,200
BYE.

1799
01:31:57,267 --> 01:31:58,200
BYE, HONEY.

01:32:02,367 --> 01:32:03,467
TAKE GOOD CARE
OF YOURSELF.

1804
01:32:03,534 --> 01:32:04,667
I WILL. BYE.

1805
01:32:04,734 --> 01:32:06,534
SAY BYE TO
MRS. MILLER FOR ME.

1806
01:32:06,601 --> 01:32:07,601
OK. GOOD-BYE.

1807
01:32:07,667 --> 01:32:08,601
SHE'S AMAZING.

1808
01:32:08,667 --> 01:32:09,968
LOOK AFTER YOURSELF.

1809
01:32:10,033 --> 01:32:11,767
BE CAREFUL.

1810
01:32:11,834 --> 01:32:12,767
OH, YEAH.

1811
01:32:12,834 --> 01:32:14,734

BYE, COWBOY!

1817
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,033
I WASN'T TRYIN'
TO HIT IT.

1818
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:42,701
THE TRICK IS
NOT TO HIT IT,

1819
01:32:42,767 --> 01:32:44,067
BUT TO MAKE IT
FLOAT.

1820
01:33:07,167 --> 01:33:10,334
HEY, HOLD IT, SONNY.

1821
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,400

1822
01:33:11,467 --> 01:33:13,234
HOLD UP ON YOUR TARGET
PRACTICE A MINUTE.

1823
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,834
I DON'T WANT
TO GET SHOT.

1824
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:18,400
WELL, THEN GET
OFF THE BRIDGE,

1825
01:33:18,467 --> 01:33:20,234

I WANT TO BUY
SOME SOCKS.

1827
01:33:21,501 --> 01:33:22,834
I GOT A LONG RIDE
AHEAD OF ME.

1828
01:33:22,901 --> 01:33:25,834
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THE SOCKS YOU GOT ON?

1829
01:33:25,901 --> 01:33:27,901
I WORE 'EM OUT
RUNNIN' AROUND HALF NAKED

1830
01:33:27,968 --> 01:33:29,067
IN THAT WHOREHOUSE
OVER THERE.

1831
01:33:29,133 --> 01:33:31,334
THAT'S REALLY QUITE A PLACE.
YOU BEEN THERE YET?

1832
01:33:32,767 --> 01:33:34,868
TAKE OFF YOUR BOOTS
AND SHOW ME.

1833
01:33:36,234 --> 01:33:37,667
OH, YOU'RE JOSHIN' ME.

1834
01:33:37,734 --> 01:33:39,501
I SAID TAKE OFF

1835
01:33:39,567 --> 01:33:41,467

1836
01:33:52,133 --> 01:33:55,000
I AIN'T GONNA DO THAT.

1837
01:33:55,067 --> 01:33:58,000
WHAT ARE YOU WEARIN'
THAT GUN FOR?

1838
01:33:58,067 --> 01:33:59,667
NOTHIN'.
I JUST WEAR IT.

1839
01:33:59,734 --> 01:34:01,200
CAN'T HIT NOTHIN'
WITH IT.

1840
01:34:01,267 --> 01:34:03,200
WELL, THAT DON'T
MAKE NO SENSE.

1841
01:34:03,267 --> 01:34:04,734
WHAT KIND OF GUN
IS IT?

1842
01:34:04,801 --> 01:34:05,734
COLT.

1843
01:34:05,801 --> 01:34:07,200
THEM'S GOOD GUNS.

1844
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:08,701
THAT'S WHAT I GOT.

1845
01:34:08,767 --> 01:34:10,868
MUST BE SOMETHIN'
WRONG WITH IT.

1846
01:34:10,934 --> 01:34:13,367
NAH, IT'S ME. I JUST
CAN'T SHOOT GOOD.

1847
01:34:13,434 --> 01:34:15,334
WELL, LET ME SEE IT.

1848
01:34:21,801 --> 01:34:25,133
COME ON. MAYBE I
CAN FIX IT FOR YOU.

1849
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,801
OK.

1850
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,267
CONSTANCE.

1851
01:35:38,501 --> 01:35:42,000

BUT PUT A SMILE

1854
01:35:53,334 --> 01:35:56,133
I AIN'T NO GOOD
AT SAYIN' I'M SORRY.

1855
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:05,200
I, UH...

1856
01:36:05,267 --> 01:36:07,801
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

1857
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:13,767
I GUESS I AIN'T
NEVER BEEN THIS CLOSE

1858
01:36:13,834 --> 01:36:15,634
TO NOBODY BEFORE.

1859
01:36:19,934 --> 01:36:21,200
HEY.

1860
01:36:21,267 --> 01:36:24,567
WHY DON'T YOU GET

HER HAIR LIKE YOU *

1872
01:37:48,267 --> 01:37:52,367
* EXCEPT
WHEN SHE WAS SLEEPIN' *

1873
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:59,701
* AND THEN SHE'D WEAVE IT
ON A LOOM *

1874
01:37:59,767 --> 01:38:04,033
* OF SMOKE AND GOLD
AND DREAMIN' *

1875
01:38:08,701 --> 01:38:14,000
* AND WHY ARE YOU

1876
01:38:14,067 --> 01:38:18,734
* STANDING THERE
IN THE DOORWAY? *

1877
01:38:18,801 --> 01:38:23,734
* YOU CHOSE YOUR JOURNEY
LONG BEFORE *

1878
01:38:23,801 --> 01:38:28,067
* YOU CAME UPON
THIS HIGHWAY *

1879
01:38:34,434 --> 01:38:37,734
