How many more days?

We ain't much more than started.

Us?

9

We're traipsing along like natural men.

10

We got other things to do.
We gotta get to Texas.

11
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:20,097
I can't hardly wait. Are you certain sure
we won't stay long in Humility?

12
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:25,174
Long enough to say how do you do
to your Uncle Zack and Aunt Sophie.

13
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:29,302
Could I count the money again?

14
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:32,098
- You sure there's enough?
- Certain sure.

15
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:35,456

Fox doubled on him.

Same as before, Pa. 215.

Are you expecting it to multiply?

25
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:09,898
Give it here. We'll blow the dog in.

26
00:03:12,305 --> 00:03:14,455

Old Gabriel himself will want
to borrow this horn on Judgement Day.

You better lie down now. Your ma
will be asking why I don't bed you down.

34
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,739
Won't you tell me
something more about Texas?

35
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:05,893
It's a place for the likes of us. No people
there much. No neighbours to crowd you.

36
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:08,778
Only wild game to see and to shoot at.

37
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:14,343
When you take a breath, it's got a clean
taste, like nobody never used it before.

Smart music, Faro.

That's the way Texas is, they say,

We like room more.

Room to stretch in. Room to see and hunt.

45

Where you set foot,
no foot's been set before.

46

Resisting an officer, breach of the peace.

- Can't you wait a minute?

- What are you doing here in Prideville?
- Passing through.

00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:05,784
Elias Wakefield.

63
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:09,136
Some of you Wakefields
just killed Mose Fromes over east.

64
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:11,301
- Weren't me.
- No?

65
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:14,258
Then you won't mind lying in jail
whilst we find out.

66
00:07:14,385 --> 00:07:16,660
- You coming peaceable?
- I ain't coming.

71
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:48,255
We was going to Texas.

72
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:52,583
Texas, now? That's a far piece.
So far I can't think it's there.

73
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:54,935
Bet it's nice.

74
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,265
There's buffalo.

75
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:05,094
- Sure enough buffalo?
- Galore. And deer too.

76
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:09,218
- And foxes for your hound?
- More varmints than you can count.

77
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:11,700
I swear!

78
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:14,942
The air has a clean taste to it.
The people don't crowd you.

79
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:19,900
No bound girls there, I reckon.
What they call indentures.

80
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:24,023
No lone woman either.

81
00:09:25,705 --> 00:09:29,539
- What, Hannah?
- Nothing. I was just dreaming.

82
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:35,901
I was free once.

83
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:40,064
I've heard the hounds making music
and the horn to blow them in.

84
00:09:40,185 --> 00:09:44,736
And you know that no one was on hill
or hollow but some free wild thing.

85
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:47,254
That's Texas!

86
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:50,063
Now you eat.

87
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:53,336
Stop poking and get the food on!

88
00:09:56,345 --> 00:10:00,384
- Who said you could feed him?
- He's just a boy.

89
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:03,065
Talk back when your time is up!

90
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,541
You seem to forget
you're still bound out to me.

91
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:13,463
Now get them vittles in there!

92
00:10:23,865 --> 00:10:25,821
Now, you eat.

93
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:32,303

Where's he at?

98
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:04,018
Glad you showed up, boys.
I almost knowed your grandaddy.

99
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:08,218
Him that got killed first
and so set the two families feuding.

100
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:10,905
Cry, ye young 'uns, cry, sweethearts,

101
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:13,141
when the feuding shooting starts.

102
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:15,335
And weep, you widows in lone homes

103
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:17,456
when a Wakefield beats a Fromes.

104
00:11:17,585 --> 00:11:20,099
He asked where he was at.

105
00:11:20,225 --> 00:11:23,376
He's here all right.
I got him safe and sound.

106
00:11:23,505 --> 00:11:26,656
- It's your chance to get even.
- Got him in the jailhouse?

107
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:29,857
- Else where'd you have him?
- You can't touch him there.

108
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:32,658
The law would know you'd done it.

109
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:35,299
You've got to think of my position.

110
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:40,977
Let's not push, boys. Let's have a drink.
Let's have a drink and talk.

111
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:49,544
Obliged for the vittles.
And for tending to my boy.

112
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:52,702
You rest easy, Little Eli.
We won't miss that boat.

113
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,385
- Pa?
- Well?

114
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:57,496
Her name's Hannah, Pa.

115
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:03,578
Pa, could a lone woman go to Texas?

116
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:07,015
If she was man enough to stand it. Why?

117
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:10,421
I mean her. With us.

118
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:14,220
No. We was just talking outlandish.

119
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:17,337
Nothing against you, miss,
but he forgets...

120
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:21,140
I couldn't get away even if I wanted to.

121
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:43,420
- As we're friends...
- As we are?

122
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,581
A constable's pay is mighty small.

123
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:48,822
- It's pay he wants.
- A little something between friends.

124
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:53,655
- Just let him out, friend.
- Or we can wait for that jail door to open.

125
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:56,743
- We're good at waiting.
- For a Wakefield.

126
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:22,057
No appreciation at all.
I've done 'em my last favour.

127
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:25,863
Won't buy a drink, won't buy a bed.

128

00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:19,981
You're arrested again, Wakefield,
and this time not for nothing.

139
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:23,142
- What for?
- Enticing a female indenture away.

140
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:25,654
He didn't. I came of my own free will.

141
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:28,982
- That's for the court.
- I'll teach you to be high-headed.

142
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:33,223
You thought you were so smart,
Wakefield. But it was me that was smart.

143
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:36,337
I knew the dog would tail you.
Them Fromeses didn't.

144
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:38,183
- Fromeses?
- They was after you.

145
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:41,183
I didn't let on.
I was afeared you'd fight them.

146
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:42,977
- Come on!
- Hold on.

147
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:45,061
Stand back!

148
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,222
Can't a man do something?

149
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:53,021
Sure. If you had more than a buckeye
in your pocket, you could buy her free.

150
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:56,535
- How much would it come to?
- Higher than you ever counted.

151
00:15:56,665 --> 00:16:00,101
- 200 dollars.
- And my costs too. Now move!

152
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:10,498
Pa! That's our Texas money.

153
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:14,174
I'll go back. I'll work hard.

154
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:16,819
You keep your Texas money, Eli.

155
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:21,178
Son, you got a proper say in this.

156
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:24,615
I don't want her to go back to him.

157
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:28,780
Do you stand with me?

158
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:38,660
I stand with you.

159
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,902
You're plumb wore out, Hannah.

160
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:20,734
Seems like all I want to do
is to leave things behind.

161
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:23,220
We'll stay the night here.

162
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:49,215
- Come another day or so, we'll all be safe.
- Safe for sure?

163
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:54,863
Mountain people like the Fromeses
stick close to their own briar patch.

164
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:58,216
It galls me some, though, to think I run.

165
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:02,536
I wouldn't call it running,
even leaving Texas out.

166
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:06,699
He ain't got much, Little Eli.

167
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:09,020
Just Faro and me.

168
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:15,259
Been half an orphan all his life,
which is why I made tracks.

169
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,661
Couldn't stand to think
he'd be a whole one.

170
00:18:19,585 --> 00:18:21,701
You're a good man, Eli Wakefield.

171
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:32,053
Don't let anything come between.

172
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,100
That's your Uncle Zack.

173
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:26,743
I'll find out where your Uncle Zack lives.

174
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:35,695
<i>(all shout excitedly)</i>

175
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,695
<i>(all shout excitedly)</i>

176
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,821
Never say die!

177
00:19:58,745 --> 00:19:59,734
<i>(creak)</i>

178
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:03,213
- <i>(creak)</i>
- <i>(men groan)</i>

179
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:05,415
Begging your pardon.

180
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,223
- A miss!
- I ought to cut that buckskin off of you!

181
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:21,382
- I just wanted to ask...
- Anything you want can wait!

182
00:20:28,745 --> 00:20:31,464
<i>(excited shouting)</i>

183
00:20:35,225 --> 00:20:38,854
<i>(shouts of encouragement)</i>

184
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:45,621
<i>(excited shouting)</i>

185
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,935
Well, son, you had enough?

186
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:57,413
What do you want?

187
00:20:57,545 --> 00:21:02,744
Begging your pardon, but could you
tell me where Zack Wakefield lives?

188
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:04,821
That your wife?

189
00:21:05,985 --> 00:21:07,657
No.

190
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,181
You looking for work?

191
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:12,614
Wakefield doesn't hire any women.

192
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:14,975
I could use one here, though.

193
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:18,780
She don't want no work.
I asked you a civil question.

194
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:22,784
You going to tell me
where Zack Wakefield lives?

195
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:26,261
- Wakefield's a particular man.
- <i>(men laugh)</i>

196
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:30,543
No use asking here.
Thank you, sir.

197
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:33,623
Second place north, on the left.

198
00:21:33,745 --> 00:21:36,020
- If he'll let you in.
- <i>(men laugh)</i>

199
00:21:42,905 --> 00:21:44,896
<i>(Faro barks)</i>

200
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:01,304
Howdy, Zack. We got here.

201
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:02,744
Elias!

202
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:05,857
Praise the Lord!

203
00:22:05,985 --> 00:22:09,057
You're a sight for sore eyes.

204
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:11,540
- This your young 'un?
- There's three of us.

205
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:14,463
There's three of you. Come on in!

206
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:18,578
- Sophie! Elias is here!
- <i>(Sophie)</i> In a shake!

207
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:20,343
<i>(Zack laughs)</i>

208
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:25,136
You wouldn't remember your Uncle Zack.
Shake hands.

209
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:28,621
- How are you, boy?
- This here is Hannah.

210
00:22:28,745 --> 00:22:30,417
- How do, miss?
- How do you do?

211
00:22:30,545 --> 00:22:32,775
- We've brought something for you.
- Oh?

212
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:35,021
- For your innards.
- Oh!

213
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,217
That's nice! Mighty nice!

214
00:22:38,345 --> 00:22:41,974
But you got no business
spending your money on fancies.

215
00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:44,938
Take off your duds. Sit down, y'all.

216
00:22:47,025 --> 00:22:49,858
Well, Elias!

217
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:56,183
And here's Little Eli all grown up almost!

218
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:01,260
That hair's pretty enough for a girl.

219
00:23:01,385 --> 00:23:05,503
You must have lost your shears,
you and your pa both.

220
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,097
This is Hannah, Sophie.

221
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:10,261
- Hello.
- Hello.

222
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:12,694
- Hannah?
- She come with us.

223
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:16,261
Oh. I didn't get the last name.

224
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:20,461
- Hannah Bolen.
- Pa freed her with our Texas money.

225
00:23:20,585 --> 00:23:23,383
It cost 200 dollars.

226
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:25,143
A bound girl?

227
00:23:28,665 --> 00:23:30,781
We're all going to Texas.

228
00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:32,941
I see.

229
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:37,578
You got to take things for what they are.

230
00:23:40,225 --> 00:23:42,785
Pity you didn't train that hound, Little Eli.

231
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:44,896
He didn't need no training.

232
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:49,303
He was natural-born smarter than any fox,
weren't he, Pa?

233
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:51,017
Get down, Faro. Heel.

234
00:23:55,145 --> 00:23:59,024
Hannah and Little Eli are plumb wore out.
Can you bed them down or not?

235
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:01,579
Take it easy, Eli. Don't get your dander up.

236
00:24:01,705 --> 00:24:05,220
We have a cabin for the girl
and you and Little Eli can stay here.

237
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:06,983
No.

238
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:12,133
Thanks all the same, but I'll be going. I
wouldn't want to cause trouble in a family.

239
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:14,938
<i>(Little Eli)</i> You can't go, Hannah.

240
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:18,624
- We'll all go.
- Eli.

241
00:24:18,745 --> 00:24:21,543
- Please.
- I will...

242
00:24:23,985 --> 00:24:28,024
- I'll stay the night.
- That's sensible.

243
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:32,502
- Sophie, show her to her cabin.
- I can find my own way.

244
00:24:42,745 --> 00:24:47,500
Hannah. We don't have to stay.
Zack's my brother and all...

245
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:50,458
I'll stay the night and then I'll go to work.

246
00:24:50,585 --> 00:24:54,863
- Work? Where?
- The tavern. He said he could use me.

247
00:24:54,985 --> 00:24:57,579
I don't cotton to the man.
We'll go, right now.

248
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,661
Where, Eli?

249
00:25:01,425 --> 00:25:06,055
Unless you work for your brother,
what'll you do for Texas money?

250
00:25:07,065 --> 00:25:09,533
I'll find something.

251
00:25:09,665 --> 00:25:12,498
Come to your senses, Eli.

252
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,185
Between the two of us,
both of us working,

253
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:20,584
we ought to be able to save up
steamboat fare for you and Little Eli.

254
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:25,857
Your pappy'll never get to Texas
unless he uses his head.

255
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:27,657
Good night, now.

256
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:35,620
- So he spent his Texas money.
- He can earn more.

257
00:25:35,745 --> 00:25:38,942
Not in time.
Not before the steamboat sails.

258
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:43,536
I'll let him fish for mussels, I'll have him
help me around the warehouse.

259
00:25:43,665 --> 00:25:46,657
But he can't make enough
and we won't tell him.

260
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:48,696
- I know...
- I know what's best.

261
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:52,056
I'll make a businessman out of him.
You leave it to me.

262
00:25:52,185 --> 00:25:56,815
I'll work the buckskin
out of him and off of him both.

263
00:25:56,945 --> 00:25:59,379
He's my little brother.

264
00:26:15,745 --> 00:26:19,215
How will we know
when the steamboat gets here, Pa?

265
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:22,064
I figure it'll be big enough to see.

266
00:26:22,185 --> 00:26:24,745
But what if it's night?

267
00:26:24,865 --> 00:26:29,222
Most steamboats got a whistle.
We'll keep an ear out for the whistle.

268
00:26:31,745 --> 00:26:33,701
Pa, look!

269
00:26:36,465 --> 00:26:39,616
Well, I declare! Looks like a pearl.

270
00:26:40,745 --> 00:26:42,861
Must be a pearl.

271
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:51,975
A whopper!

272
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:54,061
Is it worth something?

273
00:26:55,105 --> 00:26:59,337
- I wonder.
- As much as 200 dollars?

274
00:27:01,465 --> 00:27:03,376
I just wonder.

275
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:07,293
But is it ours?
Do we have to tell Uncle Zack?

276
00:27:07,865 --> 00:27:11,221
He bargained for the shells, that's all.

277
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:16,701
And seeing he's so keen
to make a businessman out of me...

278
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:20,860
In this bottle, ladies and gentlemen,

279
00:27:20,985 --> 00:27:26,742
in this bottle is the very reptile
that changed the course of history

280
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:29,902
2,000 years ago.

281
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:32,937
Yes, this very reptile.

282
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:36,057
The most poisonous serpent
known to man.

283
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:40,576
One nip from this fellow
and the gates of eternity open.

284
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:43,094
I was travelling in Egypt...

285
00:27:43,225 --> 00:27:45,261
Not now, sir.

286
00:27:45,385 --> 00:27:47,296
You, sir.

287
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:53,375
In good time I shall offer to the public
my secret herbal elixir,

288
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,497
the certain cure for aches and shakes,

289
00:27:56,625 --> 00:28:00,140
for languishments of the limbs
and troubles of the trunk.

290
00:28:00,265 --> 00:28:04,053
But let us not descend to commerce
until my story's done.

291
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:07,860
And I'll thank you not to interrupt!

292
00:28:07,985 --> 00:28:10,419
I was travelling in old Egypt

293
00:28:10,545 --> 00:28:13,378
and I befriended an ancient wise man.

294
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:15,735
Dead now, bless his bones.

295
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:17,856
And with his dying breath,

296
00:28:17,985 --> 00:28:21,534
he told me that this was the very asp

297
00:28:21,665 --> 00:28:25,180
that Cleopatra
clutched so closely to her bosom.

298
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:28,377
One stroke, two, and she was dead.

299
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:32,259
That haughty queen, that divinity of form,

300
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:35,775
that perfect pearl of pulchritude.

301
00:28:36,385 --> 00:28:40,060
He's a windbag,
but high educated, mighty high.

302
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:43,575
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

303
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:50,584
refined and scientificated
through the ages,

304
00:28:50,705 --> 00:28:53,139
has come to us, as by a miracle,

305
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,733
a medicine, a balm

306
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:59,824
to make your aching joints
as supple as a serpent's.

307
00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:02,459
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen...

308
00:29:11,745 --> 00:29:13,622
What'll it be?

309
00:29:13,745 --> 00:29:17,818
I wanted to tell this gentleman
how pretty his talk was. I sure admired it.

310
00:29:17,945 --> 00:29:19,503
Thank you, sir.

311
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:22,059
I spoke the simple truth.

312
00:29:23,905 --> 00:29:25,975
That part about the pearl.

313
00:29:26,105 --> 00:29:30,621
The perfect pearl of pulchritude,
meaning beauty, of course.

314
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:34,897
It put me in mind
of a freshwater pearl I know about.

315
00:29:35,745 --> 00:29:39,624
- A freshwater pearl?
- From a mussel, I guess it was.

316
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,701
I don't understand you.

317
00:29:42,785 --> 00:29:46,141
You see, a friend of mine's got it.

318
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:48,415
Lives over at Prideville.

319
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:53,622
Proceed, sir.
It may be that I know the man.

320
00:29:53,745 --> 00:29:56,418
My travels have taken me far and wide.

321
00:29:56,545 --> 00:30:01,175
He says it's as big as a pigeon egg
and he wants to trade it off.

322
00:30:05,585 --> 00:30:09,373
Did you ever see a pearl that size,
fresh or salt?

323
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:12,099
Never will. When I do, I'll bid on it myself.

324
00:30:12,225 --> 00:30:14,659
- You?
- Why not? I like pearls.

325
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:18,573
Why not, indeed? You manufacture
money in this humble hostelry?

326
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:21,458
Some. At least I don't sell medicine.

327
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:24,543
An insulting remark,
but I'll forgive you for it,

328
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:29,216
remembering, as the Bard of Avon said,
that the quality of mercy is not strained.

329
00:30:29,345 --> 00:30:32,815
If you're so smart,
tell us poor folks who's gonna outbid me.

330
00:30:32,945 --> 00:30:35,300
- Jimmy Monroe, that's all.
- Who?

331
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:42,293
James Monroe, president of these
United States, resident in Washington DC.

332
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:46,782
Jimmy's the biggest collector
of freshwater pearls in the world,

333
00:30:46,905 --> 00:30:49,055
barring the crowned heads of Europe.

334
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:51,301
You have been around, haven't you?

335
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:54,815
Around enough
not to butt into others' conversations.

336
00:30:54,945 --> 00:30:59,177
- I was talking to this gentleman.
- That's all I wanted to know. Thanks.

337
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:02,377
- I'll get word to my friend.
- You're welcome.

338
00:31:02,505 --> 00:31:04,814

- Shh.

341
00:31:19,985 --> 00:31:23,261
I didn't know
freshwater pearls was worth anything.

They're not, you fool!
Fletcher stuffed him like a sausage!

I'm stumped, anyhow.

Come on, you two.
I want you to meet Miss Susie Spann.

This is my little brother Eli.

353
00:32:32,145 --> 00:32:34,705
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you, miss.

354
00:32:34,825 --> 00:32:37,817
- And this is Little Eli.
- I'm glad to meet you.

355
00:32:37,945 --> 00:32:40,584
- And this is Faro.
- <i>(all chuckle)</i>

Sit down, y'all.

00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:50,813
Come on, Faro.

360
00:32:55,585 --> 00:32:59,180
I imagine I'll be seeing a great deal of you,
Little Eli.

361
00:32:59,305 --> 00:33:01,944
What grade will you be in?

362
00:33:02,945 --> 00:33:05,095
We didn't aim to...

363
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:07,693
We're bound for Texas, miss.

364
00:33:07,825 --> 00:33:09,622
Oh?

365
00:33:12,745 --> 00:33:15,020
Oh! Heavens to Betsy!

366
00:33:15,145 --> 00:33:17,500
It'll be on in a shake, folks.

367
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:23,821
- Then you've been to Texas before?
- No, ma'am.

368
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:26,618
That's our reason for going. We ain't been.

369
00:33:26,745 --> 00:33:30,897
Eli has the itchy foot and don't know
the medicine is to stop scratching.

372

I told Elias
that boy ought to learn his letters.

373
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:46,943
I'm sure his father knows
what's best for him.

374
00:33:47,065 --> 00:33:50,182
Miss Susie's topnotch in everything.

375

Can you spell "mussel"?

376
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,064

For keeping me from being a double fool.
That snake doctor hit it on the head.

510
00:45:30,345 --> 00:45:34,463
Forget it! Takes a spell
for a man to come to himself.

511
00:45:34,585 --> 00:45:39,943
Sure they mortified you. Keep your
powder dry. Our time to shoot will come.

512
00:45:40,065 --> 00:45:43,341
You really suppose
a man like me could fit in?

513
00:45:43,465 --> 00:45:45,376
Fit in?

514
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:47,416
Why, brother!

515
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:51,663
As for the boy, don't you worry.
He's just where he ought to be.

00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:05,343
<i>(giggling)</i>

517
00:46:05,465 --> 00:46:11,461
Children! I wouldn't like to tell your
parents how you've behaved today.

518
00:46:11,585 --> 00:46:13,337
Luke.

519
00:46:13,465 --> 00:46:15,421
Luke Lester!

520
00:46:22,185 --> 00:46:24,494
All right, that's better.

00:46:25,585 --> 00:46:27,894
Eli?

522
00:46:28,025 --> 00:46:30,061
Eli Wakefield?

523
00:46:37,145 --> 00:46:38,897
Eli!

524
00:46:40,505 --> 00:46:44,657
You'll never get anywhere
looking out the window.

525
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,981
<i>(horn blares)</i>

526
00:47:06,945 --> 00:47:11,416
Eli, come back! Children, stop that!
Children, come back!

527
00:47:11,545 --> 00:47:14,218
The Texas steamboat!

528
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:18,133
Look at 'em run.
Some people never grow up, Eli.

529
00:47:19,225 --> 00:47:21,739
Eli? Eli!

530
00:47:23,705 --> 00:47:25,661
Come back, Elias!

531
00:47:53,585 --> 00:47:55,462
- Little Eli!
- Hannah!

532
00:47:55,585 --> 00:47:57,143
It came!

533
00:47:57,265 --> 00:48:01,224
- I can't stay long. I'm stealing time off.
- So am I.

534
00:48:02,705 --> 00:48:05,139
Did you have to fight your way out?

535
00:48:05,265 --> 00:48:09,178
They were making little of Pa.
He's learning how to buy tobacco.

536
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:11,773
Don't fault your pa. It's for Texas.

537
00:48:11,905 --> 00:48:14,260
He promised! You heard him promise.

538
00:48:14,385 --> 00:48:17,343
You'll go. You and your pa will.

539
00:48:17,465 --> 00:48:20,537
- Will we, Hannah?
- Sure.

540
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:23,338
Can you come too?

541
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:25,660
Not yet a while, I reckon.

542
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:28,777
But you two gotta go. Somehow.

543
00:48:33,025 --> 00:48:35,061
<i>(short blasts on horn)</i>

544
00:48:36,985 --> 00:48:39,897

00:48:40,145 --> 00:48:44,457
? Texas! Texas!

? It's the land of promise
I'll tell you no lie

547

? It's the land of promise
Clean out of the sky

? 24 hours a day it's sunny
Nothing but trees...

549
00:48:54,905 --> 00:48:56,861
I gotta go.

550
00:48:58,505 --> 00:49:01,383
? A-rolling by
I'll tell you no lie

551
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:05,384

From heaven on high

Nothing but trees that just grow money

- I'm talking about Texas.
- He's telling no lie.

555
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:18,216
- I'm talking about Texas.
- I know it's no lie.

556
00:49:18,345 --> 00:49:22,338
? We're talking about Texas, Texas,
Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas

557
00:49:22,465 --> 00:49:24,456
Whoa!

558
00:49:25,785 --> 00:49:29,095
? It's the land of promise
I'll tell you no lie

559
00:49:29,225 --> 00:49:32,820

<i>(blasts on horn)</i>

563
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:56,537
Friends,
my name is Pleasant Tuesday Babson

564
00:49:56,665 --> 00:49:58,496
and I'm going to Texas!

565
00:50:00,825 --> 00:50:03,385
And I'm not going alone!

566
00:50:05,465 --> 00:50:11,142
People with brave hearts, ambitious
hands and a feel of distance in their bones

567
00:50:11,265 --> 00:50:13,017
are going with me.

568
00:50:13,145 --> 00:50:15,295
We're going to that rich Spanish land

569
00:50:15,425 --> 00:50:19,782
where Moses Austin won a grant
for mettlesome Americans.

570
00:50:19,905 --> 00:50:24,501
We'll steam to New Orleans,
harness up and saddle up for Texas.

571
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:26,661
Many have already signed.

572
00:50:26,785 --> 00:50:29,743
There's room for more.
That's why I am here.

573
00:50:29,865 --> 00:50:31,856
What's wrong with old Kentuck?

574
00:50:31,985 --> 00:50:35,864
It's a fine land. If it suits you, stay.

575
00:50:35,985 --> 00:50:39,295
But pot liquor for the goose
sometimes gags the gander.

576
00:50:39,425 --> 00:50:43,976
You don't measure land in Texas by
rod and chain. You measure with the eye.

577
00:50:44,105 --> 00:50:48,064
When the eye can see no further,
that's where you drive your stakes.

578
00:50:48,185 --> 00:50:52,656
The rifle ball has not been made
that can carry to a neighbour's line.

579
00:50:52,785 --> 00:50:54,821
And game, I tell you by the Book,

580
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:58,017
my own eyes have seen a sea of buffalo

581
00:50:58,145 --> 00:51:02,661
that took from sunup to sundown to pass.

582
00:51:03,305 --> 00:51:06,183
- Is your question answered, friend?
- <i>(laughter)</i>

583
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:12,257
But there is no great hurry. The ship
will wait the sale of your tobacco.

584
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:16,503
We will cruise the river
so that you may judge our vessel.

585
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:20,459
I will circulate far and wide among you.

586
00:51:20,585 --> 00:51:25,375
And now, my friends, if any would care
to examine our ship, come aboard.

587
00:51:25,505 --> 00:51:27,496
Welcome!

588
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:43,384
Hey! You're supposed to be in school!

589
00:51:43,505 --> 00:51:46,258
I thought you was buying tobacco.

590
00:51:47,745 --> 00:51:52,944
- Where did you get that shiner?
- It don't matter. The boat's here.

591
00:52:14,145 --> 00:52:16,978
Out of here! Get out of here! Come on! Git!

592
00:52:18,665 --> 00:52:21,179
Always messing things up!

593
00:52:30,305 --> 00:52:33,342
Miss Susie's right upset,
I hear, about school.

594
00:52:33,465 --> 00:52:35,581
You can't blame her.

595
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,900
You got to excuse Little Eli.

596
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:43,459
He ain't a man yet.

597
00:52:43,585 --> 00:52:46,543
No. <i>He</i> ain't a man yet.

598
00:52:56,785 --> 00:53:02,974
I hate Uncle Zack and I hate Aunt Sophie
and I hate Humility and everything!

599
00:53:03,105 --> 00:53:07,542
Hold on, son. Zack and Sophie
are different from us but they mean good.

600
00:53:07,665 --> 00:53:09,701
They got their side.

601
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:14,701
You gonna earn enough money
for Texas?

602
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:20,136
That black eye makes you cantankerous.

603
00:53:24,025 --> 00:53:26,858
You don't ever take me hunting any more.

604
00:53:26,985 --> 00:53:31,820
You don't hardly see me at all,
with me in school and you working.

605
00:53:31,945 --> 00:53:33,901
All right, son, I tell you what.

606
00:53:34,025 --> 00:53:37,461
Miss Susie's got an apology coming
for you breaking up school.

607
00:53:37,585 --> 00:53:41,373
When she's peacified,
we'll go hunting one night, real soon.

608
00:53:41,505 --> 00:53:43,461
It's a go.

609
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:57,175
<i>(school bell ringing)</i>

610
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:05,302
Good morning. Good morning.

611
00:54:07,065 --> 00:54:10,137
Thank you, Tommie. Good morning.

612
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:14,298
Could we have a word with you, miss?

613
00:54:14,425 --> 00:54:17,258
Surely. Would you excuse me, Stan?

614
00:54:18,545 --> 00:54:20,536
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yes, Stan.

615
00:54:21,945 --> 00:54:23,822
Good morning, Miss Susie.

616
00:54:28,905 --> 00:54:32,898
Did you have something to say
to Miss Susie?

617
00:54:33,025 --> 00:54:36,142
I thought you was gonna say it.

618
00:54:36,265 --> 00:54:39,302
That ain't the way I understood the deal.

619
00:54:41,465 --> 00:54:43,023
I'm...

620
00:54:45,265 --> 00:54:48,416
Pa says you gotta excuse me
because I ain't a man yet.

621
00:54:48,545 --> 00:54:50,934
I will be a man
when I blow the Gabriel Horn.

622
00:54:51,065 --> 00:54:53,659
I'm sure you will.

623
00:54:53,785 --> 00:54:56,618
Now run along to class, Little Eli.

624
00:55:10,825 --> 00:55:15,853
He won't tell me how he got that black
eye. He's always told me everything.

625
00:55:15,985 --> 00:55:18,419
Then I'm afraid I can't.

626
00:55:19,465 --> 00:55:21,933
It was over me.

627
00:55:22,065 --> 00:55:28,015
- You know, of course, about the pearl?
- Only what the children were yelling.

628
00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:33,943
Town ain't easy for a hunter,
and he's got hunter's blood in him.

629
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:36,898
I can tell you this much. He didn't run.

630
00:55:37,025 --> 00:55:40,734
He met his trouble
in the only way he knew.

631
00:55:40,865 --> 00:55:43,220
You can be proud of him.

632
00:55:44,385 --> 00:55:49,061
I'd like to know you both better.
Can't you come to supper next week?

633
00:55:50,185 --> 00:55:52,745
I suppose.

634
00:55:52,865 --> 00:55:55,060
Why, yes. Thanks, miss.

635
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,904
- Thursday, then?
- Sure.

You will. You'll blow it one day.

644
00:57:46,665 --> 00:57:50,101
Now listen. It ain't always we can listen.

What's wrong, Pa?

653

- Give me the horn. We got to go.
- You ain't even talked to Hannah yet.

We've got to blow the dog in.

- Hannah!
- How?

658
00:58:37,185 --> 00:58:39,540
I got it hid away for you.

659
00:58:39,665 --> 00:58:41,018
How?

660
00:58:41,145 --> 00:58:44,296
It's honest. That's enough.

661
00:58:44,425 --> 00:58:48,054
Bodine.
By selling yourself back as a bound girl.

662
00:58:48,185 --> 00:58:52,224
- Just say I drawed ahead.
- Bodine.

663
00:58:52,345 --> 00:58:55,781
They're making sport of you in the town.

664
00:58:55,905 --> 00:58:59,818
- Being laughed at don't kill a man.
- But the lingering will.

665
00:58:59,945 --> 00:59:02,379
Maybe so and maybe not.
Give that money back.

666
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:06,259
- It's on paper. Legal-like.
- Get the paper, then.

667
00:59:07,145 --> 00:59:10,740
Eli, some are born to stand still

668
00:59:10,865 --> 00:59:14,062
and some are born to run
like a hound is born to run.

669
00:59:14,185 --> 00:59:16,619
Can't you see Texas is the fox for you?

670
00:59:16,745 --> 00:59:19,896
I'm through with running. Come on, boy.

671
00:59:21,945 --> 00:59:24,778
Why are you mad at Hannah for, Pa?

672
00:59:29,665 --> 00:59:33,738
Look, we're much obliged.
More than I can say.

673
00:59:33,865 --> 00:59:38,655
- Eli, you're playing the fool.
- Let me be my own kind of fool, then.

674
00:59:38,785 --> 00:59:40,741

01:00:15,025 --> 01:00:17,095
No, Mother.

678
01:00:17,225 --> 01:00:20,058
My back has started hurting.

679
01:00:20,185 --> 01:00:24,622
- Couldn't you come and talk to me?
- After a while.

680
01:00:24,745 --> 01:00:26,940
<i>(knock at door)</i>

681
01:00:38,105 --> 01:00:40,824
Me and Little Eli, we...

682
01:00:40,945 --> 01:00:43,539
we forgot.

683
01:00:43,665 --> 01:00:47,658
- That's all. We plumb forgot.
- You just forgot?

684
01:00:48,385 --> 01:00:53,175
It was a prime night for hunting.
I promised Little Eli I'd take him.

685
01:00:53,305 --> 01:00:55,694
Here comes up a prime night.

686
01:00:55,825 --> 01:01:00,137
It's nice to know you weren't
fishing for pearls. Good night.

687
01:01:00,265 --> 01:01:02,859
I can't blame you for making small of me.

688
01:01:02,985 --> 01:01:07,536
But it was because Little Eli apologised
so good for breaking up school.

689
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:10,816
That's why I promised I'd take him out.

690
01:01:18,785 --> 01:01:22,380
All we knew, Little Eli and me,
was living free in the woods,

691
01:01:22,505 --> 01:01:25,258
shooting our meals and following foxes.

692
01:01:25,385 --> 01:01:30,459
It's habit-like with us and hard to bust,
and maybe it shouldn't be busted.

693
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,377
Eli.

694
01:01:38,665 --> 01:01:40,621
Come back.

695
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:51,136
That's the nicest apology I ever heard.

696
01:01:52,265 --> 01:01:55,302
Come in. We'll eat our supper cold.

697
01:02:02,425 --> 01:02:04,336
I'm obliged.

698
01:02:04,465 --> 01:02:06,933
I messed things up, I reckon.

699
01:02:07,065 --> 01:02:10,819
Like it was in my mind to ask you,
if I hadn't been so late,

700
01:02:10,945 --> 01:02:13,379
would you play for me again?

701
01:02:17,345 --> 01:02:19,142
Ask, then.

702
01:02:31,345 --> 01:02:33,301
Oh, Eli.

703
01:02:33,425 --> 01:02:35,461
Big Eli Wakefield.

704
01:02:36,425 --> 01:02:38,985
Oh, Eli. Eli.

705
01:02:41,865 --> 01:02:42,854
- Joe Emery.
- Here.

706
01:02:44,265 --> 01:02:47,655
- Brown. Mr Clay Brown.
- Here.

707
01:02:47,785 --> 01:02:51,334
- Postlewaite. John Postlewaite.
- Right here, sir.

708
01:02:51,465 --> 01:02:53,695
Zybee Fletcher.

709
01:02:53,825 --> 01:02:57,374
Zybee Fletcher. Zybee Fletcher.

710
01:02:57,505 --> 01:03:01,020
- Wakefield. Zack Wakefield.
- I'm taking it.

711
01:03:01,145 --> 01:03:04,342
Well, if it ain't Mr President Pearl himself!

712
01:03:10,465 --> 01:03:13,218
- Morgan. Anse Morgan.
- Here.

713
01:03:13,345 --> 01:03:15,700
Wakefield. Elias Wakefield.

714
01:03:16,705 --> 01:03:21,381
The president.
The president of these United States.

715
01:03:23,945 --> 01:03:26,459
About time he answered.

716
01:03:28,825 --> 01:03:31,498
Better late than never.

717
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:33,900
Looks like money, too.

718
01:03:38,865 --> 01:03:41,060
Come on, son.

719
01:03:43,785 --> 01:03:46,538
<i>(man)</i> I never would have believed it!

720
01:03:46,665 --> 01:03:48,860
<i>(excited chatter)</i>

721
01:03:56,545 --> 01:03:58,501
Now we'll see.

722
01:03:59,665 --> 01:04:01,621
<i>(Zack)</i> Elias?

723
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:11,454
- Hi, Eli.
- Zack.

724
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:20,454
I've got to send you to Pekin tomorrow.
I need cash from the bank.

725
01:04:20,585 --> 01:04:24,817
All right, Zack.
We'll talk about it at supper, huh?

726
01:04:28,025 --> 01:04:30,220
Tell you what.

727
01:04:30,345 --> 01:04:34,384
Ride that new <i>River Queen</i> back.
It'll be your first trip up the Tennessee.

728
01:04:34,505 --> 01:04:37,065
Can I go too, Pa?

729
01:04:37,185 --> 01:04:40,655
Sure. I'll fix it up
with Miss Susie about school.

730
01:04:40,785 --> 01:04:42,377
That all, Zack?

731
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:48,943
There's gonna be a big crowd
to welcome her as it's her first trip up.

732
01:04:49,865 --> 01:04:53,221
Being you're in business now,
you need some new clothes.

733
01:04:53,345 --> 01:04:58,260
- I'll advance the money.
- That's right nice, Zack. Thanks.

734
01:05:00,585 --> 01:05:05,943
Just be careful of those river gamblers.
They'll pick you clean.

735
01:05:07,385 --> 01:05:09,341
Now, son...

736
01:05:15,665 --> 01:05:18,463
"Dear Mr Wakefield,

737
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:21,463
the president regrets to advise you

738
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:24,895
that he is not a collector of pearls."

739
01:05:25,025 --> 01:05:32,136
"Furthermore, freshwater pearls
have no known commercial value."

740
01:05:32,265 --> 01:05:35,575
"The president has suggested that I..."

741
01:05:36,345 --> 01:05:40,896
Ain't even from the president.
Just from his hired man.

742
01:05:44,905 --> 01:05:48,784
Better not let on about this letter,
Little Eli.

743
01:05:48,905 --> 01:05:53,057
I overdone my fun
and poked my paw in the bear trap.

744
01:05:53,185 --> 01:05:55,938
Now I got to show some money.

745
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:06,376
I've got to think like your Uncle Zack.

746
01:06:43,865 --> 01:06:47,175
Pardon me, sir. That is a splendid hound.

747
01:06:47,305 --> 01:06:48,863
Thanks. He'll do.

748
01:06:48,985 --> 01:06:54,503
Fox-hunting, raising horses, perhaps a nip
or two and now and then a friendly game.

749
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:57,298
That is the life for a gentleman.
You agree?

750
01:06:57,425 --> 01:06:58,778
Sure do.

751
01:06:58,905 --> 01:07:01,817
A fair game.
Where she stops, nobody knows.

752
01:07:01,945 --> 01:07:06,097
No bet too big or too small.
Welcome each one and welcome all.

753
01:07:06,225 --> 01:07:09,900
I think I shall try my luck.
Would you care to watch?

754
01:07:10,025 --> 01:07:11,458
All right.

755
01:07:20,585 --> 01:07:24,021
- Black and odd, gents. Black 17.
- Me again!

756
01:07:24,145 --> 01:07:28,900
- I bet on 17 last time.
- Every roll a chance at fortune!

757
01:07:29,025 --> 01:07:32,938
- Spin it while I'm riding high.
- Get your bets down. He's in a lather.

758
01:07:33,065 --> 01:07:35,659
You do not mind, sir, if I bet modestly?

759
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:39,619
None too big, none too small, none
too short, none too tall. But shake a leg.

760
01:07:39,745 --> 01:07:41,940
How is it you play this game?

761
01:07:42,065 --> 01:07:45,057
Even on black or red.
Same as odd and even.

762
01:07:45,185 --> 01:07:48,973
35 to one by number.
The corners pay you eight.

763
01:07:49,105 --> 01:07:51,061
Half a number's 17.

764
01:07:51,185 --> 01:07:53,540
A fair, square game.

765
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:04,181
If I can help you, sir...

766
01:08:04,305 --> 01:08:08,537
Maybe I ought to find out first
if luck is touching me.

767
01:08:11,865 --> 01:08:15,414
A wise decision.
Ride with the flood, lie low on the ebb.

768
01:08:15,545 --> 01:08:17,297
Bets down, please.

769
01:08:17,425 --> 01:08:21,020
My bones say black.
I shall place my small pile on it.

770
01:08:21,145 --> 01:08:24,103
Black. My favourite colour.

771
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,341
Black, then.

772
01:08:31,465 --> 01:08:34,138
Black it is. Black and even.
You win, ma'am.

773
01:08:34,265 --> 01:08:37,575
- You won, Pa.
- Everybody wins but the banker.

774
01:08:37,705 --> 01:08:41,539
- Delighted you rode my winner.
- Place your money, man.

775
01:08:45,585 --> 01:08:47,576
What would you advise?

776
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:53,745
My problem is that when I gamble,
I don't know where to stop.

777
01:08:53,865 --> 01:08:57,824
But maybe I should go small again
before I ride the flood, huh?

778
01:08:57,945 --> 01:09:02,735
- Do we play or palaver, gamblers?
- Name it, friend. I'll go along.

779
01:09:02,865 --> 01:09:07,416
If I could catch a number,
I'd sure enough know my luck was in.

780
01:09:07,545 --> 01:09:10,537
- A number?
- Yes, ma'am. Then I'd know.

781
01:09:10,665 --> 01:09:13,498
I wouldn't let myself
be nibbled to death, friend.

782
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:16,617
- With your luck, strike hard.
- Please, gents.

783
01:09:16,745 --> 01:09:20,818
No. I'm gonna test her once again.
We'll bet your age, son.

784
01:09:20,945 --> 01:09:24,176
Four dollars on nine. We'll double it.

785
01:09:24,305 --> 01:09:26,136
Pa!

786
01:09:26,265 --> 01:09:30,144
As you please.
Against my judgement, I'll stay with you.

787
01:09:46,105 --> 01:09:48,858
- Nine wins! The red wins!
- Pa, I won!

788
01:09:48,985 --> 01:09:51,499
I won, Pa! Nine won!

789
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:55,584
- With luck like that...
- It will be you who will break the bank!

790
01:09:55,705 --> 01:09:57,218
We won, Pa!

791
01:09:57,345 --> 01:10:00,815
- 280 dollars gold!
- Pa!

792
01:10:02,065 --> 01:10:04,977
- Bets down, gentlemen.
- <i>(horn blasts)</i>

793
01:10:13,105 --> 01:10:17,257
Thanks, gents. Sorry to leave,
but I think we're coming to Humility.

794
01:10:17,385 --> 01:10:20,422
That's where me and my boy get off.

795
01:10:22,185 --> 01:10:27,020
- Hold on, my man.
- Monsieur, with luck and a bag of gold...

796
01:10:27,145 --> 01:10:31,821
That ain't gambling money. I never meant
to risk it. How did you get such an idea?

797
01:10:32,905 --> 01:10:35,783
Hey there, pilot! Don't stop at Humility!

798
01:10:37,265 --> 01:10:38,744
Good day, gents.

799
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:43,541
<i>(bell rings)</i>

800
01:11:01,705 --> 01:11:04,265
Hey, pilot! Stop! Humility!

801
01:11:30,905 --> 01:11:33,738
Fly! Dive or die, boys!

802
01:11:33,865 --> 01:11:34,980
<i>(cackles)</i>

803
01:11:48,385 --> 01:11:50,216
- You all right?
- Sure.

804
01:11:50,345 --> 01:11:51,698
<i>(all cheer)</i>

805
01:11:51,825 --> 01:11:53,895
Come on, Eli!

806
01:11:54,025 --> 01:11:58,496
- Who is that man?
- That's my little brother. That's my boy!

807
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:00,616
That's <i>our</i> boy!

808
01:12:05,585 --> 01:12:07,576
<i>(Zack)</i> Good evening, gents.

809
01:12:21,105 --> 01:12:23,665
Give all the boys here a little nip.

810
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:27,540
You buying, Mr Wakefield?

811
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:30,577
He is. My future partner.

812
01:12:30,705 --> 01:12:33,856
- What'll it be, then?
- Brandy. The best.

813
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:38,182
Drink up, boys. Name it.

814
01:12:39,505 --> 01:12:41,461
All of you.

815
01:12:48,385 --> 01:12:52,663
It's a dream I always had, Elias.
You and me in business, partners.

816
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:56,095
You tricked those gamblers
like a real businessman.

817
01:12:56,225 --> 01:12:59,615
It's a rich thing, Eli,
and you can buy in out of earnings.

818
01:12:59,745 --> 01:13:02,623
Pardon me. My congratulations, sir.

819
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:07,341
You gave me a lot of entertainment on
that boat. May I buy a drink, gentlemen?

820
01:13:07,465 --> 01:13:11,617
I'm sorry. We're late for supper as is.
Sophie'll be put out if we hold her up.

821
01:13:11,745 --> 01:13:14,100
- Another time, then.
- Sure.

822
01:13:15,065 --> 01:13:17,101
Gentlemen.

823
01:13:17,225 --> 01:13:21,377
A toast to the president
of these United States.

824
01:13:21,505 --> 01:13:24,781
To the president of the United States!

825
01:13:28,265 --> 01:13:31,814
You'll have these jokesmiths
looking for pearls themselves.

826
01:13:31,945 --> 01:13:33,742
Fletcher!

827
01:13:38,385 --> 01:13:41,058
Here's something by way of commission.

828
01:13:41,185 --> 01:13:43,141
Buy yourself a new snake.

829
01:13:43,265 --> 01:13:48,100
The one you've got
must be awful tired of biting Cleopatra.

830
01:13:50,505 --> 01:13:53,065
Chicken's coming home to roost,
eh, Stan?

831
01:13:53,185 --> 01:13:55,540
He's a smart fellow, that Eli Wakefield!

832
01:13:55,665 --> 01:14:00,022
- You gotta take your hat off to him.
- The last laugh was his.

833
01:14:07,185 --> 01:14:10,495
<i>(man singing merry song)</i>

834
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:29,099
- Leave him there, Eli.
- But, Aunt Sophie...

835
01:14:29,225 --> 01:14:32,501
No buts about it!
He has to learn, same as you!

836
01:15:00,185 --> 01:15:02,016
- ? Texas!
- ? Texas!

837
01:15:02,265 --> 01:15:04,221
- ? Texas!
- ? Texas!

838
01:15:04,345 --> 01:15:08,782
? It's a land of promise
I'll tell you no lie

839
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:13,740
? It's a land of promise
Clean out of the sky

840
01:15:13,865 --> 01:15:17,904
? 24 hours a day it's sunny
Nothing but trees that just grow money

841
01:15:18,025 --> 01:15:21,222
? Nothing but milk and honey rolling by

842
01:15:21,345 --> 01:15:23,301
? A-rolling by

843
01:15:23,425 --> 01:15:25,302
? I'll tell you no lie

844
01:15:25,425 --> 01:15:29,213
? The money just rolls, the honey just falls
from heaven on high

845
01:15:29,345 --> 01:15:33,304
? It's a land of promise
And heaven is proud

846
01:15:33,425 --> 01:15:38,294
? When you get on tiptoe
You're touching a cloud...

847
01:15:38,425 --> 01:15:41,178
Hannah! You gotta help me with Pa!

848
01:15:41,305 --> 01:15:45,935
He won't talk Texas.
I can't get nothing out of him any more.

849
01:15:46,065 --> 01:15:48,659
<i>(singing continues)</i>

850
01:15:53,905 --> 01:15:57,454
He's making
quite a place for himself here.

851
01:16:00,145 --> 01:16:01,294
<i>(whip cracks)</i>

852
01:16:01,425 --> 01:16:05,941
Who dasts?
Who dasts to crack a whip with me?

853
01:16:06,065 --> 01:16:08,818
My mammy was a gator
and my pappy was a bull.

854
01:16:08,945 --> 01:16:13,063
I can whup my weight in wildcats
and drink my belly full.

855
01:16:13,185 --> 01:16:14,413
<i>(laughs)</i>

856
01:16:14,545 --> 01:16:16,501
Who dasts?

857
01:16:25,065 --> 01:16:28,694
Not you, Stan.
You cut too fine a seam for me.

858
01:16:28,825 --> 01:16:30,975
Step up or shut up, folks.

859
01:16:31,985 --> 01:16:34,419
We're loaded for bear.

860
01:16:49,825 --> 01:16:52,385
You better trek for home, son.

861
01:16:53,825 --> 01:16:56,385
That's a Wakefield over there.

862
01:16:58,145 --> 01:17:01,820
- I know it.
- And you're not scared?

863
01:17:01,945 --> 01:17:03,060
Listen.

864
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:08,782
Cry, you young 'uns, cry, sweethearts,
when the feuding shooting starts.

865
01:17:08,905 --> 01:17:12,102
And weep, you widows in lone homes

866
01:17:12,225 --> 01:17:15,376
when a Wakefield meets a...

867
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:19,293
- What's your name, fighting man?
- Luke.

868
01:17:19,425 --> 01:17:23,213
- Don't say I didn't tell you, Luke.
- I'm not afraid of him.

869
01:17:26,385 --> 01:17:29,582
I'm not saying you're scared, son.

870
01:17:29,705 --> 01:17:32,265
There might be some that'd say you are.

871
01:17:33,665 --> 01:17:37,374
You can walk away,
let folks say what they please.

872
01:17:37,505 --> 01:17:39,939
Wakefield,
you don't want to whup him, do you?

873
01:17:40,065 --> 01:17:44,661
- I ain't got nothing against him.
- See? He doesn't want to whup you.

874
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,503
- Bodine!
- Mind the business.

875
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:51,255
I'll keep the peace here
if I can hold this wild man back.

876
01:17:51,385 --> 01:17:53,819
Stan, why don't you stop it?

877
01:17:55,065 --> 01:17:58,660
I'm trying to. Can't you see that, folks?

878
01:17:58,785 --> 01:18:00,741
Don't dare him, Luke.

879
01:18:00,865 --> 01:18:02,617
I dare you.

880
01:18:04,985 --> 01:18:07,135
I double-dare you.

881
01:18:33,065 --> 01:18:36,978
All business? Not one minute to spare?

882
01:18:39,745 --> 01:18:41,497
There!

883
01:18:44,105 --> 01:18:46,858
You haven't told him, have you?

884
01:18:48,585 --> 01:18:51,338
I figured it'd be better
if you and me both told him.

885
01:18:51,465 --> 01:18:53,979
Wakefield! You better come!

886
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:25,057
- Bodine, for once you've gone too far.
- I go where I please, Wakefield.

887
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:52,699
Enough, Wakefield,
or do I skin your back?

888
01:20:02,265 --> 01:20:04,938
Next time, Wakefield, I go for the eyes.

889
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:17,135
Stop it! Somebody stop it!

890
01:21:19,465 --> 01:21:21,535
Come on, you fool!

891
01:21:54,705 --> 01:21:56,457
Now, Bodine!

892
01:22:04,945 --> 01:22:06,856
Pa! Pa!

893
01:22:14,465 --> 01:22:16,296
<i>(crowd cheers)</i>

894
01:22:33,185 --> 01:22:35,494
<i>(cheering)</i>

895
01:22:37,425 --> 01:22:39,541
You all right, boy?

896
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:49,496
There's a man for me!

897
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:52,185
A real Texas man!

898
01:23:23,185 --> 01:23:25,745
We could sit here to talk.

899
01:23:39,465 --> 01:23:44,903
Well, son, I just wanted the three of us
to sort of talk things over.

900
01:23:45,025 --> 01:23:50,975
You see... me and Susie...
we're gonna get married.

901
01:23:51,105 --> 01:23:54,177
She'll be a mother for you.
A good one. Won't you, Susie?

902
01:23:54,305 --> 01:23:56,694
I'll surely try.

903
01:23:56,825 --> 01:23:59,464
<i>(steamboat horn)</i>

904
01:23:59,585 --> 01:24:02,258
We're thinking of you too, boy.
Both of us are.

905
01:24:02,385 --> 01:24:06,219
There'll be a home for you, Little Eli.
A roof over your head.

906
01:24:07,225 --> 01:24:10,740
And boys and girls to play with.
And school.

907
01:24:11,745 --> 01:24:14,100
We'll have lots of fun.

908
01:24:16,425 --> 01:24:17,983
No Texas?

909
01:24:20,065 --> 01:24:23,216
Son, we have to say goodbye
to some things.

910
01:24:23,345 --> 01:24:29,102
They was good things in their time,
but their time's wore out for us.

911
01:24:29,225 --> 01:24:32,581
You let them tie Faro up.

912
01:24:34,545 --> 01:24:38,094
You made me leave him tied up.

913
01:24:38,225 --> 01:24:40,295
We're getting him used to it.

914
01:24:40,425 --> 01:24:44,941
And you've been lying to me.
You've been lying all along.

915
01:24:45,825 --> 01:24:48,020
You never used to lie.

916
01:24:48,145 --> 01:24:52,377
- Not till we came here, you didn't.
- I just been trying to see my way.

917
01:24:52,505 --> 01:24:55,497
- I never thought I'd hate you, Pa.
- Little Eli!

918
01:24:59,505 --> 01:25:01,461
Not that, son.

919
01:25:01,585 --> 01:25:05,373
Forget you said it.
You can't be meaning it.

920
01:25:05,505 --> 01:25:07,780
I'm trying to be a right father to you.

921
01:25:07,905 --> 01:25:10,373
I'm trying to think
what kind of man you'll be.

922
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:15,533
What kind of a man are <i>you</i> coming to be?
That's the worst of all.

923
01:25:25,105 --> 01:25:27,255
You talk cruel, son.

924
01:25:27,385 --> 01:25:29,501
But even if you was right about Texas,

925
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,503
I give my word to Zack, and to Susie here.

926
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:34,934
You gave your word before.

927
01:25:35,065 --> 01:25:37,625
Please believe in your father.

928
01:25:50,225 --> 01:25:52,056
In all our lives, son,

929
01:25:52,185 --> 01:25:55,143
I don't know as I ever told you
you had to do anything.

930
01:25:55,265 --> 01:25:57,460
We got along good, you and me,

931
01:25:57,585 --> 01:26:00,258
and I pray God it will be so again.

932
01:26:03,385 --> 01:26:06,297
But now I want you
to take this horn out and lose it.

933
01:26:06,425 --> 01:26:07,938
Throw it away.

934
01:26:08,065 --> 01:26:12,855
Pitch it where we'll never find it,
so it won't be in our minds to blow it.

935
01:26:12,985 --> 01:26:17,024
The way to start off new
is to shuck off what's old.

936
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:21,581
Now, boy.

937
01:28:14,425 --> 01:28:16,381
Sometimes...

938
01:28:21,225 --> 01:28:22,977
Sometimes...

939
01:28:23,105 --> 01:28:25,255
Sometime he'll love you.

940
01:28:25,385 --> 01:28:27,421
And me too again.

941
01:28:34,545 --> 01:28:37,776
That girl. The one who works for Bodine.

942
01:28:39,025 --> 01:28:41,016
Hannah?

943
01:28:41,145 --> 01:28:45,775
She caught the whip.
She rode the wagon right on top of it.

944
01:28:47,305 --> 01:28:49,341
Hannah did?

945
01:28:49,465 --> 01:28:51,820
I stood there helpless.

946
01:28:54,305 --> 01:28:56,102
Hannah did?

947
01:28:56,225 --> 01:28:58,341
Well, I'll swear.

948
01:29:02,505 --> 01:29:05,736
Eli, you're free any time you want to be.

949
01:29:07,945 --> 01:29:12,382
Why, if it came to that,
you could come to Texas with us.

950
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:16,139
With hands for a pianoforte?

951
01:29:16,265 --> 01:29:18,540
With an invalid mother?

952
01:29:19,585 --> 01:29:21,462
Oh, Eli!

953
01:29:22,505 --> 01:29:25,941
Sometimes people
can ruin what they love.

954
01:29:28,665 --> 01:29:29,814
Susie.

955
01:29:29,945 --> 01:29:32,300
<i>(short blasts on horn)</i>

956
01:29:35,385 --> 01:29:37,535
He's growed up!

957
01:29:40,825 --> 01:29:42,975
My boy's growed up!

958
01:29:45,585 --> 01:29:47,940
<i>(short blasts on horn)</i>

959
01:30:25,625 --> 01:30:27,263
Hannah?

960
01:30:27,385 --> 01:30:29,341
Oh, Hannah?

961
01:30:39,065 --> 01:30:41,977
Well, I declare! A late visitor.

962
01:30:43,465 --> 01:30:46,741
By accident we're entertaining
some old friends of yours.

963
01:30:46,865 --> 01:30:49,823
They just happened to drop in too.

964
01:30:58,225 --> 01:31:00,341
Come on in, boy.

965
01:31:02,305 --> 01:31:04,739
Gentlemen, we have a visitor.

966
01:31:05,705 --> 01:31:07,855
Little Eli Wakefield.

967
01:31:13,825 --> 01:31:15,975
Who's with you?

968
01:31:16,105 --> 01:31:19,142
Nobody... but my dog.

969
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:21,301
Where's your pa?

970
01:31:21,425 --> 01:31:24,542
I... I lit out from him.

971
01:31:24,665 --> 01:31:25,700
Little Eli!

972
01:31:25,825 --> 01:31:28,544
A runaway, huh?

973
01:31:28,665 --> 01:31:30,781
He'll be looking for you.

974
01:31:31,745 --> 01:31:34,543
- I'll take him home.
- Keep him.

975
01:31:38,585 --> 01:31:42,624
Come, now, gentlemen.
Not against his will.

976
01:31:44,425 --> 01:31:46,575
Cut out the fancy talk, Bodine.

977
01:31:46,705 --> 01:31:49,265
We'll keep him. We'll wait for his pa.

978
01:31:50,785 --> 01:31:52,980
We're good at waiting.

979
01:32:12,865 --> 01:32:14,662
Hannah?

980
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:16,821
- Good morning, sir.
- Hannah here?

981
01:32:16,945 --> 01:32:20,255
Today I am maid and master,
a favour for my friend Bodine.

982
01:32:20,385 --> 01:32:25,664
- Have you seen Little Eli?
- No, he does not habituate our grog shop.

983
01:32:25,785 --> 01:32:27,821
- Wakefield.
- I have a place to go.

984
01:32:27,945 --> 01:32:30,505
- Mind if I walk along with you?
- It's a piece.

985
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:32,581
Let's go.

986
01:33:07,865 --> 01:33:12,734
As for the money, you don't need it.
Come as my lieutenant. I want you.

987
01:33:12,865 --> 01:33:16,938
- Even so, there's Little Eli and school.
- Man, I know.

988
01:33:17,065 --> 01:33:20,819
People have to make choices.
Choices never are perfect.

989
01:33:20,945 --> 01:33:23,664
It'll be rough in Texas. It'll be hard.

990
01:33:23,785 --> 01:33:28,256
Maybe your son won't be a scholar.
He'd be something better, I'd say, for him.

991
01:33:28,385 --> 01:33:33,220
Something truer to himself. And you'll
both have a life you'll never have here.

992
01:33:33,345 --> 01:33:36,143
What's important to your son?

993
01:33:36,265 --> 01:33:39,302
You. You, first of all.

994
01:33:39,425 --> 01:33:44,863
You doing the things you were cut out
to do. The things God created you to do.

995
01:33:44,985 --> 01:33:47,340
Not you imitating your brother.

996
01:33:47,465 --> 01:33:49,695
- Zack's all right.
- In his way.

997
01:33:49,825 --> 01:33:55,695
The Zacks of this world build businesses.
Men like you could build countries.

998
01:33:55,825 --> 01:33:57,543
Wakefield.

999
01:33:57,665 --> 01:34:02,022
Call it none of my business,
but how does your boy feel?

1000
01:34:13,825 --> 01:34:16,020
There's two of 'em.

1001
01:34:16,945 --> 01:34:19,937
- How far?
- Whoop and a holler.

1002
01:34:26,265 --> 01:34:28,825
It's that Texas man Babson.

1003
01:34:29,905 --> 01:34:32,260
That's your meat.

1004
01:34:32,385 --> 01:34:35,183
- Mine?
- You heard him. We come for Wakefield.

1005
01:34:35,305 --> 01:34:38,661
- Get him away or kill him.
- One or t'other.

1006
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:43,303
I'm a businessman. I've got a reputation...

1007
01:34:43,425 --> 01:34:45,381
Get your gun!

1008
01:34:53,425 --> 01:34:57,054
- Typical of me. It isn't even loaded.
- Load it.

1009
01:34:57,185 --> 01:34:59,540
- I can't afford to get...
- Load it now.

1010
01:35:43,305 --> 01:35:47,821
- Men, I'm clean.
- Not clean enough to do your own killing.

1011
01:35:47,945 --> 01:35:50,459
I told you where he was.
That was my part.

1012
01:35:50,585 --> 01:35:53,816
Tattle and turn tail, that's you.

1013
01:35:55,265 --> 01:35:57,540
Now, are you with us...

1014
01:35:57,665 --> 01:35:59,496
Or against us?

1015
01:36:04,745 --> 01:36:07,100
I'm staying here.

1016
01:36:19,465 --> 01:36:21,421
Killed himself.

1017
01:36:27,945 --> 01:36:31,699
Stay with the boy
and you won't come to no hurt.

1018
01:36:55,065 --> 01:36:57,021

1019
01:36:57,905 --> 01:37:02,137
You have today to think it over.
It's your life to live, Wakefield.

1020
01:37:02,265 --> 01:37:04,221
I believe in living it bold.

1021
01:37:04,345 --> 01:37:06,905
All right, Wakefield!

1022
01:37:10,505 --> 01:37:13,861
Get away, Texas,
if you know what's good for you.

1023
01:37:14,545 --> 01:37:16,661
- What's this?
- Get away, Babson.

1024
01:37:16,785 --> 01:37:18,935
Move on, Texas!

1025
01:37:19,065 --> 01:37:21,784
- This man is unarmed!
- Get away like they told you.

1026
01:37:21,905 --> 01:37:23,975
Run, we said!

1027
01:37:24,105 --> 01:37:26,665
Run, they said.

1028
01:38:13,785 --> 01:38:15,776
Pa! Pa!

1029
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:22,059
I'll go to school, Pa. I'll do anything.

1030
01:38:24,385 --> 01:38:27,934
You're safe, Pa. And I'm ashamed.

1031
01:38:30,585 --> 01:38:32,815
I ain't so proud, son.

1032
01:38:32,945 --> 01:38:34,901
Not of myself.

1033
01:38:41,465 --> 01:38:43,421
No, Hannah.

1034
01:38:45,865 --> 01:38:48,015
Don't leave us.

1035
01:38:48,665 --> 01:38:50,860
We're going to Texas.

1036
01:38:52,105 --> 01:38:54,460
We're gonna live it bold.
