wearing his ten guns easy.

came swarming in to steal the land.

the railroads were driving

{Y:i}From that moment onward,
they were outlaws.

forget what the boys had done for them.

a prayer would be better.

the best yarb lady in these here hills.

weep! That Yankee town weep!

No. Didn't say much.

some cattle and settle down,

that woman understand that

273
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:36,052
riding on a raid is one thing, while
riding to stop a raid is a whole 'nother

'73, getting the public to trust in banks

448
00:28:12,772 --> 00:28:15,771
has been the problem.
People see that banks close,

449
00:28:15,852 --> 00:28:17,492
then they see depression
and inflation.

450
00:28:17,532 --> 00:28:21,052
These people are hoarders,
because they don't trust in banks.

451

That's the landlord.

Mr. Wilcox has stopped at nothing

454
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:33,331
to get depositors for his bank.
And do you know why?

455
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:37,932
So that he can get the money, so that he can
enter into every wildcat scheme in this area.

456
00:28:37,971 --> 00:28:42,012
First, he brings in a new
vault, with a time clock.

457
00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:46,972
A time clock! Then he starts giving
away gifts, throwing lavish parties.

That didn't do any good.
And now this. Calliope.

people taken advantage of.

take your profits?

she ought to pull to the left.

killed some women and children,

732
