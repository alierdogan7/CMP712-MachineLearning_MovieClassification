1
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,930
" A Rich Find "

2
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,000
Fuckin' Postal contract

3
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,970
Got to bring these in first thing

4
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,680
I'll be right with you

5
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,400
Is he only a Goddamn fool or so stupid he thinks he's accomplished something?

6
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,490
Who?

7
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,410
You know Goddamn well who I mean

8
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,210
Who are you?

9
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,980
You Goddamn well know that too

10
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:09,010
I know from the Sheriff locking you up between sundown when I left and my coming back now,

11
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:10,981
you must have fucked up at the interval

12
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,894
Where you drunk?

13
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:16,499
You and I have met

14
00:02:17,778 --> 00:02:19,243
At the hotel buffet

15
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:20,470
Yes

16
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,410
But we wasn't introduced

17
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:24,193
I'm George Hearst!

18
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:26,332
Were you drunk,

19
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:28,193
George Hearst?

20
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:34,010
This fellow didn't keep you up here, did he?

21
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:37,623
He didn't like fart or snore too much for you, did he, Mr. Hearst?

22
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:38,652
I mean, he imbi

23
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:40,691
Holy Shit!

24
00:02:41,637 --> 00:02:42,351
Jesus!

25
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:44,333
The cocksucker's dead, George!

26
00:02:45,525 --> 00:02:46,323
Look, 

27
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:49,192
he's got a fuckin' knife in his chest

28
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:52,331
That ain't your fuckin' knife, is it, George Hearst?

29
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:57,502
Goddamn fool

30
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:00,110
Won't be the first the worms work on

31
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:03,680
I guess he deserves more than a dirt burying by some stranger,

32
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:06,722
even for only how big a fuckin' nigger he was

33
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:11,722
Don't know if using this trough was that big a fuckin' timesaver

34
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:13,710
I'll see to the burying with you

35
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:16,142
I owe a visit up there anyways

36
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:19,053
That ain't gonna raise your popularity with your fellow white people

37
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:23,123
Question I wake to in the morning and pass out with at night:

38
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:26,292
"What's my popularity with my fellow white people?"

39
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:28,022
Suppose we ought to go get him

40
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:29,971
He ain't fuckin' pretty to look at

41
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:37,311
Neither are you, fuckin' Nigger General

42
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:39,422
After that I arrested Hearst

43
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:42,443
Took him by the ear and led him to jail, where he remains

44
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:53,270
Hearst had no particular connection to Mr. Hostetler?

45
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:55,123
Both their names begin with "H"

46
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,253
It's gonna get bad here, Martha

47
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:03,011
It's Albert Swearengen, regrettin' the early hour and…

48
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:05,523
that I call without notice…

49
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:11,783
Good morning. Come in

50
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:14,290
…knowing I intrude

51
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:17,032
Mrs. Bullock

52
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:18,431
Good morning, Mr. Swearengen

53
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,143
Will you have meat and eggs?

54
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:21,912
I'd be grateful for coffee

55
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:22,973
Please sit down

56
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:28,383
Swell, stem to stern.

57
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:29,651
the place

58
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:34,572
If you will not eat, will you excuse me?

59
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:38,093
Teaches the camp's children

60
00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:39,392
Excellent

61
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:41,141
I'll walk you when you're ready

62
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:42,640
There's no burning rush

63
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:46,073
I'm sure the talk Mr. Swearengen would have with you must be important

64
00:04:54,938 --> 00:04:56,600
Last night from my balcony vantage,

65
00:04:57,175 --> 00:05:00,650
I watched you drag Hearst by the ear to Utter's Freight Office

66
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:03,682
I was waitin' on you comin' out of Utter's,

67
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,221
thinking that you might make a call on me,

68
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:08,121
tell me what the fuck was going forward,

69
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:10,120
but you did not appear

70
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:12,491
I finally asked myself,

71
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:19,630
"Could our Sheriff have took another route home, maybe through Chinaman's Alley?

72
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:22,503
And what would that bespeak of his frame of mind?"

73
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:24,791
It bespoke I didn't fuckin' feel like talking to you

74
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:27,911
"Al, busy night, Short on joy."

75
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:29,162
Could have told me that

76
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:30,553
"Let's talk another time."

77
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:32,702
I too, Bullock,

78
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:34,621
when suspecting I've fucked the dog,

79
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:38,410
keenly seek some solitude

80
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:40,450
Our hour is wrong

81
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:42,313
Having lost his man Turner,

82
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,651
being embarrassed by you, Hearst will be on the muscle,

83
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:52,681
and we, who will be his wrath's object, ought to stay close and confide 

84
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:54,320
Our alternative is flight

85
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:55,992
Does that appeal?

86
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:56,850
No

87
00:05:58,215 --> 00:06:01,023
We ain't that sort, which is maybe more the pity

88
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:07,570
Will you walk me to school now, Mr. Bullock?

89
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:08,153
Y es

90
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:10,321
Thank you for the coffee

91
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,312
You're very welcome, Mr. Swearengen

92
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:19,373
Owie

93
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:20,843
Well, Sofia,…

94
00:06:21,268 --> 00:06:22,171
We're almost through

95
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:24,351
It's cold

96
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:27,291
The fire's gone out

97
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,410
Mr. Ellsworth left for the diggings early this morning

98
00:06:35,157 --> 00:06:36,863
He didn't come to kiss me good night

99
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,780
You must not have wakened

100
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,872
I always waken from his beard

101
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,221
Well, last night you must not have

102
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:47,603
There

103
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:50,183
You look more than presentable

104
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:55,833
Excuse me just a moment, and then I'll take you to school

105
00:07:07,545 --> 00:07:08,273
Mornin', Dan

106
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:11,090
Jewel, you got you another customer

107
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:12,621
Just brought me mine

108
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:16,020
How do you

109
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:17,920
How do you feel?

110
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:23,423
You go ahead and drink that

111
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:24,681
That's at least my third damn cup

112
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:26,893
I'm jangle-nerved already

113
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:28,943
Let me go on and get shaky-handed,

114
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:31,872
pop my foot on the floor like I'm a-listenin' to banjo music!

115
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:32,813
Shit

116
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,300
Al's out

117
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:39,101
Out where?

118
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:40,930
Well, I don't know

119
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:47,651
But I bet you a nickel has somethin' to do with Bullock takin' Hearst by the ear from Tolliver's to Utter's Depot

120
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:49,521
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

121
00:07:50,118 --> 00:07:51,150
Anyways,  here's Jewel

122
00:07:54,177 --> 00:07:56,503
We had been at odds but settled,

123
00:07:57,546 --> 00:07:58,810
Hostetler and me

124
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:01,313
He'd sold me his livery,

125
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:04,073
fixing to move to Oregon,

126
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:07,941
pickin' up his fuckin' shotgun,

127
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:09,923
the negro stumbled and…

128
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:12,351
blew his black head off!

129
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,971
God damn it, Harry

130
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:28,092
And I fear no retribution, not by my own God…

131
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:30,233
or any other…

132
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:34,850
evil emissary's dispatch from the bowels of the earth

133
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:40,311
by whatever bundle of bloody fuckin' feathers and housecat teeth

134
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:43,960
the nigger race bows down to

135
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:52,061
My hands are fuckin' clean, and my heart is quiet

136
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,000
Harry?

137
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:40,020
Hurry up, Richardson

138
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,061
Thwart that Abyssinian

139
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:46,732
I don't know what you mean

140
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:51,192
Any thought he has of registerin'

141
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:53,063
Bad enough we have one in help

142
00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:56,670
Hello

143
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:57,792
Hello

144
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,231
We can't take you

145
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,554
My baby!

146
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:02,729
Ooh!

147
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:04,812
Ooh!

148
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:06,461
Your baby's growed, Mama

149
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:09,012
Oh, come on, come on

150
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:10,063
Come on around back

151
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:11,582
We'll get you into my room

152
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:15,310
You're so beautiful! Oh!

153
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:18,233
Did you hear, Richardson?

154
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,521
"Beautiful."

155
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:20,521
Yes

156
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:31,090
You make clear to Tolliver you will not confide entirety and that he oughtn't to expect you ever fuckin' will is the basic foundation attitude

157
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,573
Am I fuckin' boring you?!

158
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:34,402
No

159
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:37,312
Are you sure you don't want to tell me a joke or the like,

160
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:38,461
or dance a quick fuckin' jig?

161
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:42,213
I tell Tolliver I'm still your man and I'll never show him your fuckin' hole card

162
00:10:42,706 --> 00:10:45,690
Guy like Tolliver always believes he can see what you want not to show him

163
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:48,412
I'm tryin' not to show your hole card

164
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:49,891
That's your fuckin' act

165
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:51,261
So what do I say about Bullock?

166
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:53,232
What you say to Tolliver:

167
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,031
"I know why Bullock acted, but I'm not prepared to say

168
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:59,941
That's confidential and privileged between me and Mr. Swearengen,

169
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:01,533
who explained to me exactly"

170
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:03,432
What'll Tolliver think off that?

171
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:06,112
"This kid don't know what the fuck Bullock's doin'

172
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:07,230
and Swearengen don't either

173
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:10,663
But I, Cy Tolliver, wormed that the fuck out of him,

174
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:13,523
even though he tried not to let me. I can handle this fuckin' piss pot"

175
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:18,710
Fold your thumb,

176
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:20,460
go over and fuckin' talk to him

177
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,502
When you're done woolgathering, I'd like this sent

178
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,913
How are you today?

179
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:45,752
Well enough, Mr. Hearst

180
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:47,813
And you?

181
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:49,691
Well enough

182
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:52,921
What do you say of me in your paper?

183
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:55,722
I have nothing to report, Sir

184
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:57,120
Have you anything to give me?

185
00:11:57,497 --> 00:11:58,561
I have not

186
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,442
One dollar, twenty-five cents, please

187
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:05,900
Twenty-five cents increase to our rate

188
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:19,281
Damn pleased we got to speak, Adams

189
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:22,201
Al chose well making you his fuckin' ambassador

190
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:24,490
Far as him grabbin' Hearst by the ear,

191
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:27,151
how that affects yours and Mr. Swearengen's arrangements with Hearst

192
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:28,162
Fuckin' Bullock

193
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:30,571
Al's got specific ideas on that

194
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,950
And as soon as he's sure he wouldn't be unintentionally misleading you,

195
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:35,402
he'll want me to confide 'em in detail

196
00:12:35,795 --> 00:12:39,341
Why  don't you cap your visit with some complimentary higher-end pussy?

197
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:40,480
Thanks anyway

198
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:42,491
You know Leon here

199
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:46,580
Why don't you teach him somethin' about craps

200
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:50,672
Soon as I finish showin' water how to run downhill

201
00:12:56,145 --> 00:13:00,591
He'd have me a cur to paw through the scraps his fuckin' flunky tosses

202
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:01,391
That Swearengen

203
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:04,452
When here, Leon,

204
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:08,043
telling  me about the hobby you and Miz Ellsworth share,

205
00:13:08,316 --> 00:13:13,100
you walk me in Mr. Hearst's front door and sit me the fuck down across from him at his fuckin' table

206
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:15,920
God bless you, boy

207
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,372
Thanks,. Mr. Tolliver

208
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:25,901
I'm going to the hardware store, Charlie

209
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:27,881
I hope so

210
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:31,053
A little early to start drinkin'

211
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,000
Thought I'd stick around with you

212
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,230
Morning, Charlie

213
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:45,621
Morn'

214
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,583
Busy night last night, I hear

215
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:07,180
I recall my instructions to you as bein' that anytime you and I meet,

216
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:09,143
Swearengen's to be represented

217
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:11,341
Heard and understood, Mr. Hearst

218
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:15,152
And I hope correctly honored in the breach in this one single instance

219
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:16,732
Make your case

220
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:20,270
Not to read your mind,

221
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:27,080
but it seemed your idea for Swearengen and me had to do with this newer phase we're movin' into

222
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,882
camp's official business and the like,

223
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:34,360
Swearengen and me unofficially seein' to your interests

224
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:41,461
Because the small-mindedness and self-interested behavior that's so pervasive in this shithole

225
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:47,061
makes impossible my efficient attention to the requirements of my operation

226
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:49,483
Well, I can only imagine what that's like, Sir

227
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:52,121
Man who's accomplished what you have,

228
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:55,401
havin' to move among the low-rent cocksuckers and short-haulers

229
00:14:55,758 --> 00:14:59,530
Make your fuckin' case why you've gone against my instructions

230
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:02,873
I come into a certain piece of knowledge, Sir,

231
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,113
that could make this more a less a fuckin' company town

232
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:13,941
And my thinking was if communicatin' this privately to Mr. Hearst risks putting me and Al Swearengen the fuck out of action as middlemen,

233
00:15:15,225 --> 00:15:16,351
so the fuck be it

234
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:21,502
Suppose I could put the Ellsworth claim into play for you, Mr. Hearst?

235
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:25,971
How?

236
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:31,363
The lady's reinvolved herself with a habit that turns a person's life upside down

237
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:35,632
One of my own fuckin' employees supplies her, God help me,

238
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:36,963
and that's a habit, Sir

239
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:40,982
Makes a person subject to accident and mischance of every fuckin' sort,

240
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:47,051
having to do especially with the ups and downs of the fucking quality of the fucking shit she's being given

241
00:15:47,716 --> 00:15:48,950
I wish I'd heard this yesterday

242
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:57,311
I'll confide that wantin' to honor your instructions to the letter cost me 24 hours before approaching you

243
00:15:57,808 --> 00:16:02,130
If I had, my instructions would have had to do with bringing the inevitable about

244
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:05,942
In the interval, I have suffered certain losses

245
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,723
Oh, rest fuckin' Captain Turner's soul

246
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:11,052
I'd be quiet now, Mr. Tolliver, if I were you

247
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:17,082
Losses and indignities which,

248
00:16:17,947 --> 00:16:22,811
despite the strong impulse of my nature towards simplicity,

249
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:25,691
prompt me to a different approach

250
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:29,351
Do you enjoy that, Sir?

251
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:30,472
No, I don't

252
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:31,441
You don't enjoy that?

253
00:16:31,676 --> 00:16:32,400
I don't, no

254
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,763
And I wish you'd cut it the fuck out

255
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:37,720
I not only spent last night incarcerated,

256
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:39,692
I was taken to jail by the ear

257
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:41,492
That fuckin' maniac Sheriff

258
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:44,022
By our maniac Sheriff, that's correct

259
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:46,220
And had as a cellmate

260
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:49,762
or to be fair in describing my situation,

261
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:53,922
cohabitated  with in the adjacent cell a rotting corpse,

262
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:58,790
whom it was the Deputy's pleasure this morning to accuse me of having murdered

263
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:03,531
I'm therefore distressed and angry and I seem, for the moment,

264
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:05,220
to be taking this out on your ear!

265
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:09,780
But in the longer term my intentions are other,

266
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:11,513
and more complicated

267
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:16,032
Can we pretend the longer term's arrived, Sir?

268
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:19,472
I'd have you release me, for a fucking fact

269
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:29,263
Sorry

270
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:31,102
Temper got the best of me

271
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:33,451
Don't give it another thought, Sir

272
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:35,840
Don't kill her yet

273
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,651
I took that as your meaning

274
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:43,410
Oh, you think you can shine on me like the sun?

275
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:45,911
"Oh, Leon, you're good guy

276
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:48,163
You put me next to the bank lady

277
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:51,153
You got a great fucking future at my side"

278
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:52,432
Oh, fuck you

279
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:53,713
Fuck you

280
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,203
Don't you think I know the outcome of that?

281
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:01,370
Once the bank lady dies from the overdose,

282
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:04,290
you've had a good fucking day, I get a quick one in the ear

283
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:06,042
And of course if the day went bad,

284
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:08,673
first you're calm on me for a fucking while

285
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,083
Oh! Fuck you, rube!

286
00:18:13,246 --> 00:18:15,533
You clean up? Your 83 cents?

287
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:19,731
Or whatever you froze your balls for all day in the fucking stream!

288
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:23,192
Yeah, I'll get off right here if I want to!

289
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:29,691
Don't confuse me, Mr. T, with having no cards up my sleeve

290
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:33,192
This scholar didn't raise no stupid sons

291
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:36,033
Or that don't know…

292
00:18:36,976 --> 00:18:37,612
how to…

293
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:40,043
navigate a tight…

294
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:48,391
Morning, Mrs. Ellsworth

295
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,231
Morning

296
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:53,422
Out for a smoke

297
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,752
Fine, Trixie

298
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:04,412
My Celestial ain't in position

299
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,552
I ain't sure when he will be

300
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:09,821
Maybe you need to make a different arrangement

301
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:16,461
I wonder, Leon, if we don't know approach a turn in our conversation…

302
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:19,033
having to do with increasing your fee

303
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:20,460
If I was you, Lady,

304
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:24,381
instead of cracking fucking wise I might be thinking of different ways of spending my idle time

305
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:32,520
I can't help but noticing, your Celestial's not being in a position isn't reflected in your condition

306
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,401
Yeah?

307
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:36,642
I'm high and planning to stay that way

308
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:38,720
not to fucking mention alive

309
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:41,263
That's the last you see of me

310
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:54,850
Get the fuck out of here!

311
00:19:56,506 --> 00:19:57,760
Leave her the fuck alone!

312
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,403
If you would take that out of my ear,

313
00:19:59,918 --> 00:20:01,431
I would be happy to know what you mean

314
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:04,483
I mean, if you keep selling her dope, I will fucking kill you

315
00:20:04,545 --> 00:20:05,943
Fine, I agree

316
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:07,833
You have shown me the light

317
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:10,471
I don't want to see her high again

318
00:20:10,928 --> 00:20:12,361
Only promise me this, you meddling cunt,

319
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,860
if you do, before you head out to kill me,

320
00:20:15,168 --> 00:20:16,431
you'll ask her where she got her stuff

321
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:18,603
I am no longer the lady's supplier

322
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:23,352
May I go?

323
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:40,321
I know

324
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:43,982
Do you?

325
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:46,340
Yes, your ladyship, I do

326
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:50,441
And just heard from that shitbad Leon, you've got a new supplier

327
00:20:51,955 --> 00:20:57,363
You are quite mistaken, Trixie, and however well intended,

328
00:20:57,646 --> 00:20:58,922
beyond your proper province

329
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:00,803
Fuck you, Mrs. Ellsworth

330
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:05,800
I am in the process of making adjustments to the

331
00:21:06,158 --> 00:21:07,330
complications of my situation

332
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:08,543
Bullshit

333
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:09,623
Do not…

334
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:11,632
take over-many liberties

335
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:16,012
You've fallen back with a fucking child in your home

336
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:24,383
I will no longer be requiring your services

337
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:26,620
A lack for me

338
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:30,442
How I hoped I could work here forever

339
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:40,822
I  give up music with my fucking

340
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:44,012
I don't need any more friends than what I got

341
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:49,031
And I give up clocking that cocksucker upstairs

342
00:21:49,747 --> 00:21:51,061
An inscrutable figure

343
00:21:51,386 --> 00:21:52,012
Mr. Hearst

344
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:54,572
Now what I want you to know:

345
00:21:55,455 --> 00:21:58,923
His first activities impinging on me I don't hear about beforehand from you,

346
00:21:59,078 --> 00:22:00,330
I'm gonna cut your fucking throat

347
00:22:00,398 --> 00:22:01,220
Goodness

348
00:22:03,345 --> 00:22:05,102
You see that 200 I've given ya?

349
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:06,462
I do, yes,

350
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:08,590
at the margin of vision

351
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:11,192
That argues there's a better way

352
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:17,393
Take the desk

353
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:24,690
Liberia

354
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,812
He mind me here 'fore his say-so?

355
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:29,792
How is he gonna mind you come see your mother?

356
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:31,450
Here in your room

357
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:33,533
He give me this room

358
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:39,342
"You stay here, Aunt Lou. Who says what, no Goddamn never mind to me."

359
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:42,622
That's good then

360
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:44,082
Well, well, well

361
00:22:45,588 --> 00:22:47,360
You've company in your room, Aunt Lou

362
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:49,693
My boy, Mr. Hearst

363
00:22:50,177 --> 00:22:51,143
My boy Odell

364
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:54,642
Your boy? How do you do, Odell?

365
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:55,811
How do you do, Sir?

366
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:58,821
Where have you been, Mr. Hearst?

367
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:00,440
Let me fix you up some breakfast

368
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:05,381
You made yourself at home, Odell, here in the room I set aside for your mother

369
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,521
I asked him in, yes, Sir

370
00:23:07,945 --> 00:23:09,763
Yes, Sir, that was me asked him in

371
00:23:10,227 --> 00:23:13,561
Well, now that your mama has invited you in,

372
00:23:14,118 --> 00:23:16,952
I suppose we might say on the spur of the moment,

373
00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:25,232
I hope that you'll accept my invitation as well as the hotel's owner and your mother's employer

374
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,232
Please, Odell, won't you stay?

375
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:31,052
I will, Sir

376
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,641
Thank you. Thank you for your kindness

377
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:36,173
Not hungry just now, Aunt Lou

378
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:43,643
Here, Al, is your answer

379
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:49,003
Nor would 10 times the sum have tempted me

380
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:50,211
Should have known

381
00:23:50,675 --> 00:23:52,081
You confirm my judgment then

382
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:53,572
you were the money's source

383
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:55,792
As it happens, E.B., I was not

384
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:56,900
I see

385
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:04,433
In that case you may view my behavior as a random display of loyalty

386
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:08,222
Explaining yourself offers a better chance of getting it back

387
00:24:08,408 --> 00:24:10,210
That money, Al, came from Tolliver

388
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:15,151
Seeking knowledge, as he claimed, of such Hearst's activities as I,

389
00:24:15,457 --> 00:24:18,393
operating the man's hotel, might come into

390
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:24,570
How could I not believe it was you orchestrating the approach as some form of test?

391
00:24:25,585 --> 00:24:28,383
The alternative would have Tolliver, knowing my history with you,

392
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,973
believing nonetheless that he could approach me,

393
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:36,743
swaying my loyalty as if I had no morals more than a street whore

394
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:42,173
Ain't to Tolliver's standard, the baldness of it

395
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,782
My thinking exactly

396
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:46,652
The lack of prelude or prologue

397
00:24:48,146 --> 00:24:49,002
It's Hearst

398
00:24:49,385 --> 00:24:53,761
Hearst, is he Caesar, to have fights to the death for diversion?

399
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:55,753
Murder his workers at whim?

400
00:24:56,135 --> 00:24:57,962
Smash passages in the fucking wall?

401
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,973
A man of less wealth would be in fucking restraints

402
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,671
We're in the presence of the new

403
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:07,292
Fuck the fucking new! Jesus Christ, Al

404
00:25:07,886 --> 00:25:09,031
Is it over for us here?

405
00:25:09,485 --> 00:25:10,730
Go back to the hotel, E.B.

406
00:25:11,606 --> 00:25:12,572
Save us

407
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:14,501
Think of something

408
00:25:14,957 --> 00:25:15,941
Have I ever not?

409
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,893
We'll discuss that money another time

410
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:26,300
There's leaving the camp

411
00:25:26,635 --> 00:25:27,041
No

412
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:30,282
No, I...no

413
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:34,322
One thing

414
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:38,762
if he knew it was coming, Bill was not shy of drawing first

415
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,530
Seth locked up Hearst instead of that

416
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:43,191
Oh, I get it

417
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:46,933
Wh-what does that mean?

418
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:48,722
It means, Mr. Star,

419
00:25:49,368 --> 00:25:54,342
after leading him by the ear through camp for all to fucking see,

420
00:25:54,995 --> 00:26:00,521
Seth installs Hearst in a cell adjoining a man he's had killed,

421
00:26:01,055 --> 00:26:03,161
that the knife still protrudes out of his chest

422
00:26:05,008 --> 00:26:06,832
And as much as me and Hearst conversed,

423
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:08,781
I made him address my ass

424
00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:15,050
So do let's don't pretend Hearst will feel he was treated legal or-or-or civilized,

425
00:26:15,717 --> 00:26:17,813
or that his bidness with us is finished

426
00:26:18,938 --> 00:26:20,952
Hearst is fucking coming

427
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,801
Bringing us back to Bill and doing unto others first

428
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:29,981
Which ought maybe include a-a-a visit to Hearst's fucking diggings

429
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:33,543
And his muscle you fail to murder before they arouse?

430
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:35,721
You bring to chase you to camp

431
00:26:36,445 --> 00:26:38,303
Judas goat the cocksuckers

432
00:26:38,678 --> 00:26:44,462
for Swearengen's men and Tolliver's to mow down from fucking ambush while we're up seeing to Hearst

433
00:26:45,388 --> 00:26:46,892
There'll be nothing left of the camp

434
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:48,613
Uh

435
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:55,510
How much you figure will stand once Hearst had his fucking say?

436
00:27:18,747 --> 00:27:23,903
Truth is if I on Tolliver's instructions provide an overdose Mrs. Ellsworth dies from,

437
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:26,582
for being able to say he told me to,

438
00:27:27,137 --> 00:27:28,633
who does he fucking croak next?

439
00:27:29,598 --> 00:27:31,712
You are lethally fuckin' middled

440
00:27:34,998 --> 00:27:40,100
So she says, "No no, I want five oxen and one chicken"

441
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:43,991
Rube fucking humor

442
00:27:45,005 --> 00:27:45,533
Mr. Tolliver

443
00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:46,583
Come with me, Leon

444
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:49,110
Let Con calm down

445
00:27:55,065 --> 00:27:56,083
Hold off

446
00:27:56,996 --> 00:27:57,510
Hold off?

447
00:27:57,827 --> 00:27:58,903
Hold the fuck off

448
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:00,470
Don't fucking step up the purity

449
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:01,973
Just keep selling her what you've been fucking selling

450
00:28:03,337 --> 00:28:06,333
It's a wise man that knows his own limits. Now go ahead out there, son,

451
00:28:07,427 --> 00:28:08,823
and continue doing wrong

452
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:10,880
Yes, Sir, Mr. Tolliver

453
00:28:17,638 --> 00:28:18,792
Cocksucker

454
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:20,910
Everything all right?

455
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:21,740
Leave me alone!

456
00:28:28,805 --> 00:28:29,523
Ooh

457
00:28:32,817 --> 00:28:34,301
I wouldn't mind turning a fucking trick

458
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:37,920
Get the fuck out of here!

459
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:40,303
We ain't hiring

460
00:28:41,515 --> 00:28:42,551
Fuck you anways, Al,

461
00:28:42,706 --> 00:28:44,423
for not recognizing a figure of speech

462
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:46,860
It ain't one you ought to employ, you stupid bitch

463
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:51,182
I made a casual remark, and off-handed comment

464
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:53,792
I wouldn't mind turning a fucking trick

465
00:28:54,508 --> 00:28:56,262
Operate out of the back of his store,

466
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:58,130
then you're so set on lifting your skirts

467
00:28:58,628 --> 00:29:00,443
Let some fuck filthy from the mines,

468
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:02,811
breath rotten from his broken teeth

469
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,783
piss-reeking, shit-stinking fuck every hole in your body

470
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:07,973
What's the matter with you?

471
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:12,472
I lose patience with cunts too ignorant to know when their lots improved

472
00:29:16,758 --> 00:29:17,860
She's using again

473
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:19,810
Who do we speak of now?

474
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:21,441
The fucking Mrs. Ellsworth

475
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:26,672
And I told her I knew and that she'd ruin her child and that I quit her stupid job

476
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:29,580
Oh, if that don't straighten her out, I don't know fucking what

477
00:29:29,838 --> 00:29:30,990
What was I supposed to do then?

478
00:29:31,275 --> 00:29:34,482
Look after your fucking self, you loopy cunt

479
00:29:34,788 --> 00:29:35,991
Now get the fuck outta here!

480
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:55,512
Hello

481
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:57,401
Hello

482
00:30:01,545 --> 00:30:02,601
I thought you'd be at the bank

483
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:03,943
I came away without something

484
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:07,850
You might hurry not to make Sofia tardy

485
00:30:12,425 --> 00:30:13,273
Where did you stay?

486
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:15,532
At the diggings

487
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,430
Was Sofia upset?

488
00:30:19,746 --> 00:30:20,712
As you may imagine

489
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:24,603
May I appeal to you to reconsider?

490
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:30,002
I needn't be your husband to be what father to Sofia I can

491
00:30:31,356 --> 00:30:33,072
I care for you a great deal

492
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:44,811
An arrangement like ours 

493
00:30:46,055 --> 00:30:48,020
wouldn't get anymore tolerable to you

494
00:30:50,578 --> 00:30:51,450
And I couldn't bear it,

495
00:30:52,745 --> 00:30:53,573
seeing....

496
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:55,911
what you'd do to yourself

497
00:30:58,707 --> 00:31:00,500
You'll straighten around if I go

498
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:28,470
I can't help noticing you just now Mr. Blazanov, uh

499
00:31:28,425 --> 00:31:29,302
I'm sad

500
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:31,073
I see

501
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:33,210
I imagine

502
00:31:34,585 --> 00:31:35,953
my murdered parents

503
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:37,980
They were killed on their farm

504
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:41,190
while I was a student in Petersburg

505
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:43,313
I imagine their bodies

506
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:46,683
like the man we found on our walking

507
00:31:48,637 --> 00:31:51,111
We are swept up, are we not,

508
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:55,370
by the large events and forces of our times?

509
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:00,673
How much they saved…

510
00:32:02,998 --> 00:32:05,832
to send me for study

511
00:32:20,056 --> 00:32:21,602
I'm gonna go ahead and try this cobbler

512
00:32:23,018 --> 00:32:25,092
Don't think I didn't notice you hadn't tried it yet

513
00:32:28,217 --> 00:32:29,273
Oh, that's delicious!

514
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:33,981
And praise God how fast the mails must be getting to be

515
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,270
'Cause it ain't a month since I wrote

516
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:42,732
27 days

517
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:50,642
I keep track when I send you my letters so I know when to hope for one back

518
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:56,451
And him sending for me to come here, it's 27 days since I wrote to tell you that

519
00:33:00,137 --> 00:33:04,932
And I just can't feature Odell all that way in Liberia,

520
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:09,703
you could have gotten my letter that took the time it took to get to you

521
00:33:10,218 --> 00:33:14,040
and then you take passage to come back here to America,

522
00:33:14,548 --> 00:33:20,012
and got from New York City to hell and gone out here all in 27 days

523
00:33:20,608 --> 00:33:22,092
I can't feature it's possible

524
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,843
Whoo, Praise God, Praise God!

525
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,942
Well, Mama, maybe I set out without having the letter

526
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:33,462
But then you couldn't have known I was here

527
00:33:33,907 --> 00:33:35,733
Couldn't have knowed it proved, you mean

528
00:33:36,385 --> 00:33:38,462
Would've had to took it on faith,

529
00:33:39,556 --> 00:33:42,783
reading in the newspaper that he was here in this place,

530
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:45,421
you would be too

531
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:47,352
Decided it was time

532
00:33:57,915 --> 00:33:58,652
There you are

533
00:34:01,128 --> 00:34:01,970
Here we are

534
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:05,213
Odell. I had thought to find you inside

535
00:34:05,715 --> 00:34:07,513
I hope you don't take me for ungrateful

536
00:34:08,085 --> 00:34:10,052
I have an inkling you're wise, Odell

537
00:34:10,497 --> 00:34:11,820
I've gotten used to being outdoors

538
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:14,262
All that time at the site of the find

539
00:34:15,246 --> 00:34:17,003
What find do you refer to, Son?

540
00:34:19,256 --> 00:34:20,220
Liberia, Sir

541
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:21,331
The gold

542
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:26,991
Invite you now to sit down with him to eat

543
00:34:27,807 --> 00:34:29,940
"Sit across from me and have dinner, Odell"

544
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:36,411
That before you said Gold, fire's in his eyes you was anyplace indoors at all

545
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,620
Gold seemed to change his mind

546
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:43,882
Don't you want to say "Yes, Ma'am" or "Yes, Mama," before that or after, Odell,

547
00:34:44,436 --> 00:34:46,800
so my heart feels how sweet you are?

548
00:34:48,316 --> 00:34:49,171
No, ma'am

549
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:53,023
Make me know you sweet,

550
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:56,763
God-fearing and truthful like I wanted my boy to be

551
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:04,080
Back from where you send him, raising up to a man, safe amongst his own

552
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:08,140
Liberia…free

553
00:35:09,085 --> 00:35:11,130
Free? Shit

554
00:35:11,506 --> 00:35:13,122
Don't you speak to me thatta way!

555
00:35:13,507 --> 00:35:14,113
What way mama?

556
00:35:14,357 --> 00:35:15,853
Use language like that to me!

557
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:20,932
No kinda truth? Yes, Ma'am. Liberia

558
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:21,640
free

559
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:23,601
Praise Jesus

560
00:35:24,225 --> 00:35:25,581
Here come the spirit over me

561
00:35:25,938 --> 00:35:26,861
Don't you take him in vain

562
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:28,600
Don't you dare to do it!

563
00:35:29,215 --> 00:35:29,893
All right

564
00:35:30,736 --> 00:35:31,282
All right

565
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,332
What was the truth of it then?

566
00:35:39,165 --> 00:35:40,200
Liberia?

567
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:44,711
No field work

568
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:46,873
African niggers for that

569
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,473
Now they lazy and stupid, Mama

570
00:35:50,378 --> 00:35:54,762
American niggers steal off the African, till the English cheat us out of it

571
00:35:55,828 --> 00:35:57,133
Hot till you can't breathe

572
00:35:58,475 --> 00:35:59,581
Nothing ever be dry

573
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:00,691
Hate the air

574
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,263
Hate the breathing in and out

575
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:07,073
Liberia

576
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:13,711
Is there gold, Odell?

577
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:23,140
A rich find, Mama. Rich. Praise God

578
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:28,570
He give his son for our sins and Mr. Hearst to help us

579
00:36:30,448 --> 00:36:31,461
Where are you going, boy?

580
00:36:33,607 --> 00:36:35,680
Find a place where a nigger can have a drink,

581
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:37,640
before he sits down with Mr. Hearst

582
00:36:41,385 --> 00:36:48,060
Putting that dead one's kidneys up his nose, however the fuck else they summon up their demons

583
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:51,490
Beat thighbones on tin pans

584
00:36:51,946 --> 00:36:55,292
shake and'rattle and hop the fuck around

585
00:36:55,518 --> 00:36:56,252
Another?

586
00:36:58,018 --> 00:36:59,743
Am I swine, Harry,

587
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:09,913
that in an otherwise empty joint the owner must make a show of relocating further away from me?

588
00:37:10,337 --> 00:37:13,960
Maybe it's you being present keeps away the broader clientele

589
00:37:14,286 --> 00:37:19,260
And maybe, Tom, it's the chill in here is what does it,

590
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:25,510
when every edifice else in camp's been swanked up and seen to

591
00:37:26,825 --> 00:37:28,300
Look inward, why don't you?

592
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:30,320
Instead of always blaming the other

593
00:37:37,168 --> 00:37:38,540
Welcome to the Number 10

594
00:37:38,818 --> 00:37:40,011
My name is Tom

595
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:41,901
Harry'll take your order

596
00:37:42,606 --> 00:37:44,973
His name is Steve

597
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:53,441
Whiskey

598
00:38:00,977 --> 00:38:01,690
Afternoon

599
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,861
Where is my dinner companion?

600
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,271
I don't know where that boy's got to, Sir

601
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:15,392
I guess we all have different ideas, Aunt Lou,

602
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,510
of what constitutes punctuality

603
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:20,283
Guess everybody do about everything, Sir

604
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:22,121
Look like more and more that's true

605
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:23,883
Why don't I go find him?

606
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,133
You don't believe he's forgotten?

607
00:38:25,945 --> 00:38:27,232
I don't know no more, Sir

608
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:28,662
Let me just get past you

609
00:38:28,928 --> 00:38:31,223
What if he returns and you're still gone? Who'll serve dinner?

610
00:38:31,627 --> 00:38:33,833
I'm getting past you Mr. Hearst, please do excuse

611
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,050
Where's the livery at?

612
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:49,183
I'm not assuming you know left from right, or I'd have spoken

613
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,653
I've never done that sober in my life

614
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:53,702
Pissed yourself?

615
00:38:55,205 --> 00:38:58,560
And if account of the mishap circulates, I will know the fucking source

616
00:38:59,557 --> 00:39:00,270
Who could I tell?

617
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:04,243
I'd ve never known it had happened if you hadn't started screaming about it

618
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:09,060
Pissing yourself at the grave of your best friend and most admired person you've ever known,

619
00:39:09,955 --> 00:39:11,773
that ain't cause for fucking dismay?

620
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:16,793
Bible instructs us when two of different races return from a graveyard together,

621
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,493
the event should be marked with liquor

622
00:39:19,425 --> 00:39:22,050
Praise God! Thank you, Jesus

623
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:27,040
I come looking for you, that cooked for you and your friend as was strangers to me

624
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:27,991
What's your trouble?

625
00:39:28,337 --> 00:39:29,502
Save my boy, Sir

626
00:39:30,507 --> 00:39:32,520
That's past his mother's lap

627
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,020
Yeah

628
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:46,172
How are your spirits, Chief?

629
00:39:46,947 --> 00:39:47,540
All right

630
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,222
Do not bullshit me, Dan!

631
00:39:49,966 --> 00:39:51,611
The task I'd assign you is pivotal

632
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:52,670
I'm all right

633
00:39:53,336 --> 00:39:55,032
And leave the matter at that?

634
00:39:55,378 --> 00:39:57,081
Well what the fuck else would you want me to say?

635
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:00,062
Nothing. You gave me the basis to decide

636
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,550
I'm not fuckin' sending you anywhere

637
00:40:02,057 --> 00:40:03,643
Well, fuck where you were gonna send me!

638
00:40:04,378 --> 00:40:06,691
And fuck the task you were gonna assign me to do!

639
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,671
And that confirms my opinion, that indifferent rejoinder

640
00:40:10,247 --> 00:40:12,481
I'm on the verge of stiking you a fucking blow

641
00:40:12,836 --> 00:40:16,132
Oh, which I would be inclined to absorb as proof you'd passed the killing of that giant

642
00:40:17,027 --> 00:40:19,272
Which I have been waiting for you to volunteer

643
00:40:19,676 --> 00:40:21,193
Then why didn't you just ask me to volunteer it?

644
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:24,683
Because opinion solicited does not equal one freely voiced

645
00:40:27,586 --> 00:40:30,440
This is what I predicted to Johnny, virtually word for word

646
00:40:31,005 --> 00:40:31,700
About what?

647
00:40:32,116 --> 00:40:33,252
How you'd react to that killing

648
00:40:34,218 --> 00:40:37,461
"Dan, Johnny, does not like killing to end a fair fight."

649
00:40:37,756 --> 00:40:38,860
"Oh, why, Al?" Asked Johnny

650
00:40:39,156 --> 00:40:41,013
"Because - and I fucking have to explain to him - "

651
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:45,841
it's more like a contest, Johnny, or the like, a bout."

652
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:47,810
Seeing a light go out of their eyes

653
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:50,540
In the one you had left in its socket

654
00:40:53,936 --> 00:40:56,270
Better in his one than the both of yours, hmm?

655
00:40:59,346 --> 00:41:04,041
I'd have you go to Cheyenne to see to the hiring of guns

656
00:41:06,427 --> 00:41:06,900
All right

657
00:41:07,186 --> 00:41:08,771
Wishing an alternative would come to me

658
00:41:09,486 --> 00:41:10,461
Want me go to Bismarck?

659
00:41:10,716 --> 00:41:12,410
An alternative to the hiring of guns, Dan

660
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:16,882
Yeah, Hearst's pockets are bigger than ours

661
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:23,062
Being neighbor to his prick, which Bullock may as well have belittled when grabbing him by his fucking ear

662
00:41:34,886 --> 00:41:38,162
Do you feature the Nigger General getting my boy to take that money?

663
00:41:39,588 --> 00:41:41,343
No man better for the task

664
00:41:42,468 --> 00:41:44,870
That Little Nigger General has a gift

665
00:41:45,446 --> 00:41:50,672
Gets you to an attitude he'd have you and goes about his business

666
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:56,180
Leaves you to stand in wonderment. "What happened to change my mood?"

667
00:41:56,715 --> 00:42:03,050
Or change my opinion or decision, take money maybe I never featured I would,

668
00:42:03,668 --> 00:42:05,471
come fire or flood or the like

669
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:12,381
That's the Little Nigger General all over

670
00:42:13,056 --> 00:42:14,783
I pray Jesus you're right

671
00:42:15,105 --> 00:42:19,020
Oh, having no pull in that quarter, I'm tolerable confident, I am

672
00:42:21,255 --> 00:42:22,693
Could I have a swig?

673
00:42:24,045 --> 00:42:30,262
Now that is the first giant step towards long-term understanding and friendship

674
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:36,813
Do not employ a mug lest next we'd be donning white gloves

675
00:42:38,365 --> 00:42:39,162
All right then

676
00:42:46,158 --> 00:42:47,893
Yes yes yes

677
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:53,032
Yeah, there's a new house policy now at the Number 10 Saloon:

678
00:42:54,047 --> 00:42:58,043
Anyone at all can drink or move in and take up residence,

679
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,930
for all the fuck the policy cares

680
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:04,480
Ain't meaning to be here long

681
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:05,731
Ain't looking to drink

682
00:43:06,345 --> 00:43:10,112
All's I'm here for, Steve, is to talk to this here Gentleman

683
00:43:10,408 --> 00:43:15,841
Go ahead and do somersaults or peel bananas with each other for all I give a fuck

684
00:43:16,435 --> 00:43:18,570
The whole place has gone to shit anyhow

685
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:19,923
What could we have to talk about?

686
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:23,271
Your Mama did me a kindness and she asked me to talk to you

687
00:43:23,696 --> 00:43:28,140
I guess I also got to tell you she give me $742 to give to you

688
00:43:28,755 --> 00:43:30,153
if you just get the hell out of camp

689
00:43:32,228 --> 00:43:33,103
What's your name?

690
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:34,921
Nigger General Samuel Fields

691
00:43:36,855 --> 00:43:38,010
Now my plan

692
00:43:38,606 --> 00:43:45,891
I got 1200 left to me by a tall nigger who,after he sold his fucking livery to Steve there, blew his fucking head off

693
00:43:46,565 --> 00:43:49,830
past that $742 in my pocket that I'm trying to give you,

694
00:43:50,736 --> 00:43:53,302
my plan is get to San Francisco,

695
00:43:54,316 --> 00:43:58,371
buy enough white pussy to stretch from the harbor to the closest rooming house that'll have me

696
00:43:59,238 --> 00:44:01,891
and then fuck my way to the pacific ocean

697
00:44:08,557 --> 00:44:11,022
She said that, uh, she sent you away

698
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:13,380
Mmm, not far

699
00:44:13,647 --> 00:44:14,850
Fucking Africa

700
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:17,450
Damn. What'd you say made her mad?

701
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:18,893
Called her Mama

702
00:44:19,597 --> 00:44:22,523
So now you want to run a little something on her boss,

703
00:44:23,096 --> 00:44:25,403
which would be a waste of that high yellow skin, Odell

704
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:26,690
We done talking, Samuel

705
00:44:36,228 --> 00:44:37,431
All yours

706
00:44:58,086 --> 00:45:00,441
The nigger I appointed to dine with does not appear

707
00:45:02,196 --> 00:45:05,510
As well, since his mother's not here to serve us

708
00:45:09,685 --> 00:45:11,113
What do you know of last night?

709
00:45:11,557 --> 00:45:12,760
My stomach hurt

710
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:15,813
I was discomfited otherwise

711
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:20,392
Stupid, aren't you?

712
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:22,640
Yes, Sir

713
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:29,903
Better than what some of these others are

714
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:36,730
This place displeases me

715
00:45:37,678 --> 00:45:39,071
I'm taking measures to bring it down

716
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:40,661
All right

717
00:45:48,587 --> 00:45:51,990
Does he speak of the hotel? Or even more?

718
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,722
That they're armed and awake don't have to mean they're fucking hired

719
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:08,362
Yeah, and when I feel a shit coming on I'll remember to drop my pants

720
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:10,741
The obvious merits utterance

721
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:13,082
Character is fucking pertinent

722
00:46:13,496 --> 00:46:16,591
If I'm to go, I'd as soon get started before the darkness

723
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:18,570
Going means the darkness is upon us

724
00:46:24,586 --> 00:46:25,342
Bullock

725
00:46:29,117 --> 00:46:30,552
Could him and me talk?

726
00:46:32,408 --> 00:46:34,992
Sure. Converse amongst yourselves

727
00:46:40,427 --> 00:46:42,101
Charlie Utter thinks it has to come to blood

728
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:44,300
Charlie Utter's likely right

729
00:46:45,056 --> 00:46:47,382
And if it has to, that we should strike first

730
00:46:51,425 --> 00:46:55,243
Believe me, even now in the forest,

731
00:46:55,988 --> 00:47:00,952
the blade would be between my teeth, me and you making our way stealthily forward

732
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:11,142
And as to us and him, if blood's what it finally comes to,

733
00:47:11,636 --> 00:47:15,371
100 years from now the forest is what they'll find here

734
00:47:16,725 --> 00:47:18,920
Dewy morning's lost its appeal for me

735
00:47:21,437 --> 00:47:25,360
I prefer to wake indoors. Dan!

736
00:47:26,356 --> 00:47:27,452
You don't travel tonight!

737
00:47:29,545 --> 00:47:30,172
Come

738
00:47:31,066 --> 00:47:32,802
Need of canned peaches, Johnny

739
00:47:34,216 --> 00:47:36,063
Let's collect the camp elders

740
00:47:36,868 --> 00:47:38,863
Be baffled among friends, huh?

741
00:47:42,895 --> 00:47:43,990
I tried, Miss Lady

742
00:47:49,478 --> 00:47:52,503
No. No, no

743
00:48:00,388 --> 00:48:01,081
Gentlemen

744
00:48:03,598 --> 00:48:04,340
Mr. Hearst

745
00:48:08,257 --> 00:48:09,030
Odell!

746
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:11,960
Odell!

747
00:48:13,847 --> 00:48:14,643
Hello, Mr. Hearst

748
00:48:16,408 --> 00:48:17,522
Who's the new nigger?

749
00:48:18,058 --> 00:48:18,903
Fucking late, son

750
00:48:20,466 --> 00:48:21,820
Oh, sorry, Sir

751
00:48:22,715 --> 00:48:24,012
Your Mama's tardy as well

752
00:48:24,388 --> 00:48:24,993
Is that so?

753
00:48:25,537 --> 00:48:28,482
That's all right, we'll await her speaking of gold

754
00:48:28,945 --> 00:48:29,740
Oh, that'd be just wonderful, Sir

755
00:48:31,007 --> 00:48:31,810
How's the finger?!

756
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:32,882
All right, Mr. Hearst

757
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,090
How's the fucking ear?

758
00:48:40,077 --> 00:48:41,192
Good, Bullock, good

759
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:44,561
By dissembling our feelings we keep the strategic edge

760
00:48:52,316 --> 00:48:53,240
You don't get him

761
00:48:53,686 --> 00:48:54,952
You don't take him from me

762
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:56,442
Oh no

763
00:48:56,798 --> 00:48:57,513
You don't get him

764
00:48:58,107 --> 00:48:59,152
You don't take him from me

765
00:48:59,538 --> 00:49:02,070
Not quick, but she does seem full of purpose

766
00:49:09,135 --> 00:49:13,430
People are fucking people, and that is fucked up!

767
00:49:15,727 --> 00:49:20,442
You don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, 'cause you don't know people

768
00:49:21,266 --> 00:49:26,501
I know people and I know the way they fucking operate

769
00:49:27,305 --> 00:49:28,480
Who are you talking to, Jane?

770
00:49:30,025 --> 00:49:32,682
What business or concern is that of yours?

771
00:49:33,117 --> 00:49:34,332
I wondered where you were

772
00:49:35,018 --> 00:49:37,753
I'd hoped you come stay with me instead of going back to all this

773
00:49:38,545 --> 00:49:40,253
Whatever you mean by this,

774
00:49:41,305 --> 00:49:47,213
I have been recently engaged in complicated negotiations with niggers…

775
00:49:48,138 --> 00:49:54,153
who equal any other creature walking upright being able to fuck themselves up

776
00:49:56,175 --> 00:49:57,951
I got myself a room at Shaunessey's

777
00:49:59,655 --> 00:50:00,843
The offer still stands, Jane

778
00:50:01,238 --> 00:50:02,951
I'd really like it if you'd come stay with me

779
00:50:03,588 --> 00:50:05,790
I am a creature of habit and routine

780
00:50:06,558 --> 00:50:09,273
And I am a creature of difficulty falling asleep

781
00:50:09,627 --> 00:50:11,820
If I don't mind pissing myself to stay asleep,

782
00:50:12,245 --> 00:50:16,931
I'm not likely to destroy a habit routinely sleeping someplace completely elsewhere

783
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:17,952
Come on, Jane. We're going

784
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:21,641
You ain't got the fucking manpower to pull my ass up

785
00:50:22,035 --> 00:50:22,451
Come on

786
00:50:23,275 --> 00:50:26,112
You're putting yourself very much in danger, my friend

787
00:50:29,506 --> 00:50:32,833
Very very very ver very very much in danger

788
00:50:38,297 --> 00:50:39,252
That's all right, Jane

789
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:40,913
Come on

790
00:50:41,778 --> 00:50:44,571
