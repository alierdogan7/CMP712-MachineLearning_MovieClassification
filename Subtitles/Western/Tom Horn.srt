1
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:52,908
- Morning.
- Morning. What do you want?

2
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:56,780
What do you want?

3
00:02:56,888 --> 00:02:58,150
How much?

4
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:00,247
Twenty-four cents. Cash.

5
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:05,228
Don't put him in with any other horse,
would you?

6
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:06,559
Why not?

7
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:08,495
lt'd just be better.

8
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:10,361
That'll be extra.

9
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:18,470
Put him in with another horse,
he's gonna kill him.

10
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:21,176
That'll be extra for you.

11
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:23,339
What the hell else does he do?

12
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:27,112
He can spin in half his own length
in crossfire from either side.

13
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:30,643
If you drop a dime over in that stall,
don't stoop over to get it.

14
00:03:30,722 --> 00:03:33,691
- Get it with your pitchfork.
- What do you keep him around for?

15
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,626
That's a mother-in-law horse.
Know what that is?

16
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:40,358
A mother-in-law horse is a horse
you put your mother-in-law on.

17
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:44,227
Send them both up in the hills
and hope they don't ever come back.

18
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:45,993
Here's your money.

19
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:49,199
He just all-around looks after
my best welfare.

20
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:52,508
I'm going out and get a morning whiskey.

21
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:56,439
If all goes wrong,
I'll come back and sleep in that stall.

22
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:57,777
What about your tack?

23
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:00,283
Just leave it in there.
Anybody that's brave enough...

24
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:03,446
to go in there and get it,
they're welcome to it.

25
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:13,290
- Harry, pass the champagne.
- Breakfast champagne in Hagersville.

26
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:16,926
Now, how can I pass the champagne
when Dexter here drank it all?

27
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:18,629
Barkeep, a little more champagne.

28
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:20,170
Soon as we get to San Francisco...

29
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,468
I want to check out
where Mahare is training.

30
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,942
Gonna be pretty tough.
I understand he's copying your style, Jim.

31
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:27,535
I'm not worried about him.

32
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:29,978
The last 10 guys he faced,
he knocked them out.

33
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:31,879
He's never seen Jim's footwork, either.

34
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,886
Remember that Florida fight? You were
so fast, he couldn't land a punch.

35
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:39,886
That new punch of yours
is the greatest in the game.

36
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:43,022
Tex, did you ever hear of a hook punch?

37
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:45,022
No, I haven't.

38
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:48,497
We're toasting the man
with the greatest hook punch in the world.

39
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:51,968
Barkeep, give Tex some champagne
so that he can toast with us.

40
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:54,665
- I'd rather have whiskey.
- Give him anything he wants.

41
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:57,799
Jim, you brought a touch of class
to this game.

42
00:04:57,976 --> 00:05:00,069
And a lot of pretty ladies.

43
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:03,844
Tex, you ready?

44
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:05,744
What are we toasting?

45
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:08,650
We're toasting the next
heavyweight champion of the world:

46
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,585
"Gentleman Jim" Corbett.

47
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:13,886
He's gotta fight for it yet,
so he ain't champion.

48
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,722
Why don't we toast
something interesting?

49
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:16,886
Like what?

50
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:20,221
Like Geronimo there. He's interesting.

51
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:22,732
In a pig's ass. Don't you read the papers?

52
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:24,962
They put Geronimo in jail,
where he belongs.

53
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:27,095
Let me ask you something, Tex.

54
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:29,663
Who's Geronimo next to Jim Corbett?

55
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:31,909
Geronimo's a man so great...

56
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:36,038
that Corbett there'd have to stand
on his mother's shoulders to kiss his ass.

57
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:37,308
Frank.

58
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:56,126
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.

59
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:58,665
Do you have a gun, Tom?

60
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:01,800
- No, I don't.
- Good.

61
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:05,399
Then you're gonna get
exactly what you deserve.

62
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,068
I don't know where you come from...

63
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:10,273
but the manners that you arrived with
are just awful.

64
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:13,980
I'm trying to imagine
how you could make such a reference...

65
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:16,987
to the mother of the future
heavyweight champion of the world.

66
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:20,957
You ain't champion yet.
Besides, you're acting like an asshole.

67
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:24,094
- I could go to the penitentiary over you.
- Now, wait a minute.

68
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:26,824
Before we start this fight,
I wanna ask you one question.

69
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:29,867
- Is it about my mother?
- No. I've said enough about her.

70
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:32,768
If I win this fight,
am I the champion of the world?

71
00:06:32,837 --> 00:06:33,895
You're not big enough.

72
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:36,634
Then what are you picking on
a little fellow like me for?

73
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:40,576
You get in a fight in a public bar,
they'll discredit you from your profession.

74
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:42,306
I'm gonna save you from that.

75
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,938
That ain't the real Tom Horn, is it?

76
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:46,483
He doesn't seem to be
too scared of Corbett.

77
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:47,916
He's gonna get himself killed.

78
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:54,522
Lord, the end is here.

79
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:58,823
- Is Tom Horn in there?
- Yeah, he's here.

80
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:00,728
Last stall on the right.

81
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:03,700
But I wouldn't go in there
with that horse if I were you.

82
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:05,759
That son of a bitch is harebrained.

83
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:07,964
He's got him trained to stand people off.

84
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,998
Well, he's a hero of the frontier
and he's lying here in Hagersville...

85
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:14,045
with his face kicked in.

86
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:19,015
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

87
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,009
How bad you hurt?

88
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:22,986
Wasn't much of a party.

89
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:27,082
Say, you another one
of those newspaper guys?

90
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:31,060
No, I ain't, but I'd like to get you out
from under that horse if I can.

91
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,090
Open up that gate and I'll walk him out.

92
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:46,934
Let me ask you something.

93
00:07:47,812 --> 00:07:50,474
- Are you in fact Tom Horn?
- Yes, I am.

94
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:55,686
Goddamn, Tom.

95
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:04,760
You know, here in Jerkville,
where these yokels...

96
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:08,262
is busy flicking dandruff
off their mail-order suits...

97
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,769
they forget awful quick
that it was men like you that made it...

98
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:15,795
safe and possible for them
to lead out their dull little lives.

99
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:18,900
Right now,
I wish I had nothing to do with it.

100
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:23,973
- What's your name?
- John Coble.

101
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:27,207
What can I do for you, John?

102
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:31,885
Well, first, I'd like to offer you my ranch
till you get recovered.

103
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:35,049
<i>And then I'd like to offer you work...</i>

104
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:38,162
<i>that suits both your ability</i>
<i>and your quality.</i>

105
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,857
<i>I'm a fair hand, and I'll earn my keep.</i>

106
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,025
<i>Yeah, I know you will, Tom.</i>

107
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:47,796
We better stop and water our horses
here at Brown's Hole.

108
00:08:49,274 --> 00:08:51,970
We should move on as quickly as we can.

109
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,458
Tom, some of those cows in there
are mine.

110
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:14,258
What are you looking at, Mr. Coble?

111
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:18,393
We're just gonna water our horses,
and we'll be moving on.

112
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,938
You like to buy some of them cows?

113
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:25,574
I don't want no trouble, and like I say,
we'll be moving on.

114
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,508
How about a little dance?

115
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:01,110
Give us a little dance, Mr. Coble.

116
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:05,409
Dance.

117
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:07,177
I said dance.

118
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:20,062
All right, Mr. Coble,
why don't you just ride on out?

119
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,903
Get that shooter
and put it in this water trough.

120
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:35,037
Move!

121
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:52,261
You son of a bitch!
I'll get you, you son of a bitch!

122
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:55,465
Tom, that little deal
back there at Brown's Hole...

123
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:59,196
ought to give you an idea of what
we've been putting up with out here.

124
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:37,234
I ain't never seen roping like that. Damn!

125
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:39,071
He sure don't rope like no Christian.

126
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:44,875
I wanna tell you.

127
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,483
Any means that you have to take...

128
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:49,850
to eliminate this rustling problem...

129
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:53,613
we're all behind you 100%.

130
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,753
- Whole organization?
- All of us.

131
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,627
<i>I'll just have to take your word</i>
<i>on that, John.</i>

132
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:04,733
<i>You got it.</i>

133
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:43,030
Hey, Tom. How you feeling?

134
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:44,699
We're plugging along.

135
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:48,803
I'm giving a little party at the house.
I'd like you to meet everybody.

136
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,348
- I'm kind of raggedy.
- Nobody'll mind.

137
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:55,011
Most of the Association will be there,
and they're all anxious to meet you.

138
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:56,212
Okay.

139
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:07,997
Pipe down.

140
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:13,236
Ladies and gentlemen,
in this age of quarter-section pastures...

141
00:13:13,304 --> 00:13:16,705
and tinhorn legislators
who is riding our old trails...

142
00:13:16,874 --> 00:13:20,935
it's a real pleasure to welcome
a vestige of that heroic era...

143
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:22,912
that we just about lost.

144
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,175
Standing beside me, right here...

145
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:29,709
is the legendary tracker and interpreter
of the Apache wars...

146
00:13:30,455 --> 00:13:31,717
Tom Horn.

147
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:40,158
You're welcome, sir.

148
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:43,592
Tom, this is Arlo Chance.

149
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:46,631
- Tom.
- Ora Haley.

150
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:47,932
Howdy.

151
00:13:48,005 --> 00:13:49,802
- lan MacGregor.
- Proud to meet you.

152
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:12,328
What's the matter, Tom?

153
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:14,724
- What is it?
- It's a lobster.

154
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:19,592
I'll be darned.
I've never eaten a bug that big before.

155
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:24,305
That's a Maine lobster.
Broiled alive, packaged in seaweed...

156
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,639
and shipped out here by train.

157
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:31,315
At every station, the conductor drains
the melted seawater off of them.

158
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:49,728
- You getting the hang of it?
- I'm trying.

159
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:03,174
Tom, I don't know
whether John here told you...

160
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:05,772
but we've got
a hell of a range problem here.

161
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,650
The damn rustlers have
completely wiped out our herd profits...

162
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:12,013
not to mention...

163
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:15,490
what the buzzards and the predators
have done to our cash crops.

164
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,586
We got people
homesteading our rangeland...

165
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:20,756
and raising sheep on our grass.

166
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:25,633
Right at the present time, Mr. Horn,
what's your primary source of livelihood?

167
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:29,104
Mr. Coble offered me
to ease up at his place for a while...

168
00:15:29,173 --> 00:15:30,731
and I said I'd earn my keep.

169
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:32,105
That's good enough.

170
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:35,412
Tom, you met Joe Belle?
United States Marshal.

171
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,674
Hello.

172
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:39,175
I'm not wanted for anything, am I?

173
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:41,144
Why don't you two fellows see...

174
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:43,881
if you can get your heads together
for a few minutes?

175
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:44,979
Go ahead.

176
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:47,957
- Do you know who I am?
- No.

177
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:53,093
What you used to be in the southwest...

178
00:15:53,164 --> 00:15:54,859
I used to be in the northwest.

179
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:56,593
How does that work?

180
00:15:57,602 --> 00:16:00,901
I know that you've been,
as I've been, a man hunter.

181
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:02,664
I was a tracker.

182
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:05,909
Better still.

183
00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:10,311
John Coble's put in
a pretty fervent recommendation for you...

184
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:13,680
to The Cattlemen's Association
to help control the rustling.

185
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:16,311
I believe his point was...

186
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:19,845
handling rustlers after your experience
with the Apache wars...

187
00:16:19,924 --> 00:16:22,415
should be like shooting fish in a barrel.

188
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:24,654
Now, you're talking about...

189
00:16:24,862 --> 00:16:27,888
the high side of shooting
and the low side of the law.

190
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:33,633
Bring them to trial if you like.
I feel that what I know about you...

191
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:36,499
you're gonna wanna go ahead and shoot.

192
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:41,402
From the standpoint of the Association,
that's going to be entirely up to you.

193
00:16:42,747 --> 00:16:45,272
Whether I bring them in or shoot?

194
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,813
Is your problem.

195
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:53,757
You're a U.S. Marshal.
You tell me, what's the difference...

196
00:16:53,824 --> 00:16:57,157
between a U.S. Marshal and an assassin?

197
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:02,089
A Marshal's checks come in on time.

198
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:15,511
Say, did Buffalo Bill ever ask you
to be in his Wild West Show?

199
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:21,247
Yeah, he asked me once out in Arizona,
where we had a lot of people killed.

200
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:24,744
He offered me my own act.

201
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:28,048
Like I said, we had a lot of people killed.

202
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:30,919
Joe.

203
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:34,521
- Can I talk with you a minute?
- Sure.

204
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:49,709
Man of the West, Indian tracker,
and scared to death of lobster.

205
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,747
It was my first time.

206
00:17:58,022 --> 00:17:59,546
What do you...

207
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:00,955
Teach school.

208
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:02,492
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

209
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,660
- What were you going to ask me?
- That.

210
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:07,828
- What?
- What you do.

211
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:10,056
I teach school.

212
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:12,396
School teacher?

213
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:18,135
What was it like out in Indian territory?

214
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:22,135
Lonely as hell.

215
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:29,649
- What did you do out in the West?
- Cowboy.

216
00:18:31,822 --> 00:18:34,017
What do you do for Mr. Coble?

217
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:35,350
Cowboy.

218
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,993
Joe, I think we've found our man.

219
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:42,065
Not anything in Brown's Hole
I couldn't take care of.

220
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,067
Well, I think Horn's reputation...

221
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:48,867
might be as effective
as his Winchester is here.

222
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:53,171
I have quite a good reputation myself.
It always seems to precede me.

223
00:18:53,377 --> 00:18:55,572
I know that, Joe, but...

224
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,049
your political ambitions are gonna
fit right in with our future plans.

225
00:19:00,117 --> 00:19:02,813
Now, we don't wanna forget that, do we?

226
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:04,785
And, besides...

227
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:08,985
there won't be no chocolate cake
for Horn up there at Brown's Hole.

228
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:12,923
- Where are you from originally?
- Hawaii.

229
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:15,125
Hawaii?

230
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,766
Yeah, Hawaii.

231
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:20,060
Did you live in one of those grass huts?

232
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:21,870
In a hotel.

233
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:25,166
- They have those there?
- Sure they do.

234
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:28,443
Sure come a long way
to teach school in Wyoming.

235
00:19:28,746 --> 00:19:31,806
I guess you could say
I've had a romance with the West...

236
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:33,873
since I was old enough to read.

237
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:36,817
- You miss that ocean?
- Sometimes.

238
00:19:38,723 --> 00:19:41,385
You know, I never learned how to ride.

239
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:43,416
Is that right?

240
00:19:44,295 --> 00:19:45,626
Glendolene.

241
00:19:47,932 --> 00:19:51,333
It's a nice afternoon, John.
I enjoyed my lobster.

242
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:53,165
And I know Mr. Horn did, too.

243
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm glad you liked it.

244
00:19:55,072 --> 00:19:57,404
- Excellent afternoon, John.
- Joe.

245
00:19:58,442 --> 00:19:59,602
Tom.

246
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:09,950
Giddap.

247
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:20,228
The way I see this,
you'll be a stock detective.

248
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:25,629
See that the rustling gets stopped.
You can stay here at the ranch...

249
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:27,830
and I'll pay your wages as a cowhand.

250
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:31,932
$200 for every rustler
that goes somewhere else...

251
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:33,636
to ply his trade.

252
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:44,045
- Who do I report to?
- To me.

253
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:50,384
And as far as you are concerned,
you and Joe Belle never discussed this.

254
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:53,392
And for that matter, neither have I.

255
00:21:18,255 --> 00:21:19,620
Twenty-five. Do I hear 25?

256
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,784
Would you bid 30? Thank you.
Now a half. Would you bid a half?

257
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,021
Would you bid 35? 40. Thank you, sir.

258
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:27,825
Now a half. Would you bid a half?
75. Got a dollar.

259
00:21:27,898 --> 00:21:29,957
How about going on for a half? $1.50.

260
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:32,366
Would you bid $2? Did I hear $2?

261
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:34,267
I got $2 right over here. Thank you, sir.

262
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:37,432
Sold to Western Trail Packing Company
for $2.

263
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:40,405
Could I see that bill of sale?

264
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:49,451
Thank you, son.

265
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:54,980
You consider this an actual bill of sale?

266
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:57,526
I'm just the auctioneer, sir.

267
00:21:57,595 --> 00:22:00,029
The bill of sale's been sworn to.

268
00:22:00,097 --> 00:22:02,224
Well, whoever swore to it...

269
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,164
was a liar and a cow thief.

270
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:09,503
Those cows belong to John Coble
of the Wood River Cattle Company.

271
00:22:09,573 --> 00:22:11,370
Who the hell are you?

272
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,677
Stock detective.

273
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,471
What's a stock detective?

274
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:19,874
Me.

275
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:22,842
You may call yourself
some kind of stock detective...

276
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,014
but I'm a deputy sheriff,
and I'm the law here.

277
00:22:27,157 --> 00:22:30,251
Lock these men up. I'll file the charges.

278
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:33,785
Nobody's going to jail,
unless you start some trouble.

279
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:35,525
I see.

280
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:38,601
I'll tell you what, Horn. I'm gonna kill you.

281
00:22:38,836 --> 00:22:40,667
You ain't gonna kill nobody.

282
00:22:40,771 --> 00:22:42,329
If he don't, I will.

283
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:46,172
- Your damn charges ain't gonna stick.
- lf the charges don't stick...

284
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:50,574
I'll just take it between us
as who gets who first.

285
00:22:50,648 --> 00:22:52,616
That's how it's gonna be, then.

286
00:22:52,683 --> 00:22:54,275
There won't be no more cows stolen.

287
00:22:54,351 --> 00:22:56,376
Not from
the Wood River Cattle Company...

288
00:22:56,453 --> 00:23:00,287
the Bar-Three Cattle Company,
or the Haley Cattle Company.

289
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:03,488
Consider that my last word on the matter.

290
00:23:19,743 --> 00:23:21,335
Come on, boys, let's have an auction.

291
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:18,031
You know, I got a weird feeling.

292
00:24:18,135 --> 00:24:19,534
Yo, me too.

293
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:21,600
We're being followed.

294
00:24:23,307 --> 00:24:24,672
Look!

295
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:11,025
Tell them what you saw here.

296
00:30:44,688 --> 00:30:46,212
That you, Horn?

297
00:31:18,054 --> 00:31:20,181
You coming in here after me?

298
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,799
Giddap! Come on.

299
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:46,503
Get them up there.

300
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,434
Hang in there. Come on.

301
00:33:18,942 --> 00:33:21,809
Let him stop first, then give him slack.

302
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:29,375
Hitch him up.

303
00:33:31,254 --> 00:33:32,778
Hang in there.

304
00:33:46,202 --> 00:33:48,966
Ease up on him there. You got him.

305
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:17,096
Yeah, he's a good horse. You go ahead...

306
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:19,226
ride him around a little bit
and tire him out.

307
00:34:19,302 --> 00:34:23,033
Keep his head up. If you keep his head up,
he ain't gonna buck.

308
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:27,405
- Could I talk to you a minute?
- You bet.

309
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:31,405
All right, you go ahead
and take the rough off of him.

310
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:35,042
I'll come back after he's quieted down
and put a handle on him.

311
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:39,280
What'll I do if I get into a real storm
with this horse?

312
00:34:39,356 --> 00:34:43,452
Just get off of him the best you can,
but don't let him roll in that saddle.

313
00:34:47,964 --> 00:34:49,556
I think that...

314
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:53,599
I need that horse!

315
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,735
Shit. Stop that horse!

316
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,171
I need that horse.

317
00:35:03,346 --> 00:35:04,574
Get that horse.

318
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:10,544
I can understand you smaller children...

319
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,214
but you older children have no excuses.

320
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:16,315
So, we're going to stay
until you get it right.

321
00:35:16,393 --> 00:35:20,124
Now, I don't want any erasures,
so turn the page and start fresh.

322
00:35:22,198 --> 00:35:24,428
Put that mouse in your pocket.

323
00:35:39,215 --> 00:35:40,807
I brung you a horse.

324
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,281
Class dismissed.

325
00:35:56,466 --> 00:35:58,559
Lord, it's like a stampede.

326
00:36:03,173 --> 00:36:05,607
- I'm not dressed for riding.
- Sure.

327
00:36:08,111 --> 00:36:09,908
Go on home. Go on.

328
00:36:12,382 --> 00:36:15,146
- I'm not dressed for riding.
- Why, sure you are.

329
00:36:15,218 --> 00:36:17,982
Why, women ride all the time
dressed like that.

330
00:36:18,054 --> 00:36:20,022
I busted that horse for you.

331
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,524
Come on, I'll boot you up on him.

332
00:36:58,328 --> 00:37:01,229
- He's beautiful.
- He's a good horse.

333
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:04,530
Come on, I'll put you up there.

334
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,567
Okay. Done.

335
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:11,371
You all right?

336
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:13,568
- How do I get...
- Take hold of these reins.

337
00:37:13,643 --> 00:37:16,874
Grab his reins,
grab a little handful of his mane.

338
00:37:18,815 --> 00:37:21,375
Give him a little kick in the slats.

339
00:37:22,285 --> 00:37:25,311
Yeah. Hold on with your thighs.

340
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:29,052
That's it. Kind of roll your hips a little.

341
00:37:29,692 --> 00:37:32,286
Roll your hips along with the horse.

342
00:37:33,797 --> 00:37:35,287
You ride good.

343
00:38:24,714 --> 00:38:27,911
So, I finally got my teaching diploma...

344
00:38:27,984 --> 00:38:31,818
and I taught in Cincinnati for a while,
and Denver, and...

345
00:38:32,255 --> 00:38:34,416
Well, I've been everywhere.

346
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:36,614
I'm an adventuress.

347
00:38:36,693 --> 00:38:39,890
I thought that was a girl
that worked in dance halls.

348
00:38:40,163 --> 00:38:44,395
- No?
- No. That's a girl who goes on adventures.

349
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,666
How do you figure this day
we're having out here?

350
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:51,570
- An adventure.
- Yeah?

351
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:59,441
How do I work into it, this adventure?

352
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:10,426
I see a man of the Old West
trying to live in the New.

353
00:39:11,461 --> 00:39:15,192
Do you know how raggedy-ass
and terrible the Old West really was?

354
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:18,063
- No.
- lf you spend any time with me...

355
00:39:18,134 --> 00:39:21,035
you'll find out just how
raggedy-ass it was.

356
00:39:22,372 --> 00:39:24,602
You love it out here, don't you?

357
00:39:25,108 --> 00:39:26,439
Yes, I do.

358
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:08,284
- Morning.
- Good morning.

359
00:40:10,086 --> 00:40:12,316
Looking for Lee Mendenhour's place.

360
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:15,314
Two drainages over is a little basin.

361
00:40:15,692 --> 00:40:18,286
Lee is situated on the morning side.

362
00:40:21,631 --> 00:40:25,499
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.

363
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:27,870
Well, I thought maybe.

364
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:31,034
Look, I ain't never stole nothing.

365
00:40:31,774 --> 00:40:33,867
I sure am sorry about Lee.

366
00:40:34,177 --> 00:40:37,669
- He wasn't too damn bad a fellow.
- He's still with us.

367
00:40:38,214 --> 00:40:39,613
He is now.

368
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:44,142
Well, he weren't too bad a fellow.

369
00:41:38,074 --> 00:41:40,770
Those are Coble's cattle
you're running there.

370
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,702
Same old deal.

371
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,206
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.

372
00:41:45,615 --> 00:41:48,106
You get my note,
tell you to get out of this area?

373
00:41:48,184 --> 00:41:50,379
Yeah, I got your fucking note.

374
00:41:50,453 --> 00:41:53,650
I rolled it up with some tobacco
and I smoked it.

375
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:55,452
That what I did, champion.

376
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:28,689
You killed my horse, you son of a bitch.

377
00:43:35,258 --> 00:43:37,192
- How are you?
- Morning.

378
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:08,769
Howdy, John.

379
00:47:09,138 --> 00:47:10,469
Gentlemen.

380
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:16,269
It's this Horn situation. We got a problem.

381
00:47:17,246 --> 00:47:20,943
You think maybe he might be
just a little bit too protective?

382
00:47:21,417 --> 00:47:24,750
You know we still got
the Nolt sheep problem on the south fork.

383
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,651
But the rustling has stopped.

384
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:29,885
Yeah. I think it's his rifle
every bit as much as his reputation...

385
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:31,187
that's done that.

386
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,491
It's almost a foregone conclusion
that this fellow's working for us.

387
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:38,294
You know, after that incident in town,
we're just within one damn inch...

388
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:41,268
of having our names splattered
all over the newspaper...

389
00:47:41,337 --> 00:47:44,238
and I don't have to tell you
what an embarrassing situation...

390
00:47:44,306 --> 00:47:45,671
that can put all of us in.

391
00:47:45,741 --> 00:47:47,436
What do you suggest?

392
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:50,602
John, we just can no longer
afford this fellow.

393
00:47:50,846 --> 00:47:53,644
He's only doing
what we hired him to do, you know.

394
00:47:53,716 --> 00:47:57,152
The time has come for us
to divest ourselves of this Mr. Horn.

395
00:47:59,722 --> 00:48:00,814
How?

396
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:04,121
I think Joe there
is the answer to that question.

397
00:48:13,636 --> 00:48:16,628
Let this thing lie down, John. Understand?

398
00:48:20,843 --> 00:48:22,470
Thank you, John.

399
00:49:27,776 --> 00:49:29,243
<i>Bob, look at this:</i>

400
00:49:29,311 --> 00:49:32,508
<i>"Man thrown in prison</i>
<i>for eloping with his sister-in-law. "</i>

401
00:49:32,581 --> 00:49:34,879
I'll be. I wonder what he did.

402
00:49:38,988 --> 00:49:41,081
Put down the paper and play.

403
00:49:45,427 --> 00:49:46,758
It's cold.

404
00:49:49,999 --> 00:49:52,126
Nolt boy got killed, Tom.

405
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:56,397
- Who's that?
- Nolt boy, Jimmy Nolt.

406
00:50:00,376 --> 00:50:01,900
How did that happen?

407
00:50:01,977 --> 00:50:04,070
Shot with a.45-.60.

408
00:50:05,247 --> 00:50:07,147
That's what I shoot, a.45-.60.

409
00:50:08,384 --> 00:50:09,976
Shoot what, Tom?

410
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:14,413
Prairie dog.

411
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:50,520
- Jimmy Nolt's dead.
- Yeah.

412
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:53,890
Where's your horse?

413
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,654
He's dead, too.

414
00:51:22,825 --> 00:51:24,417
I knew you'd be there.

415
00:51:25,594 --> 00:51:27,357
- You did not.
- Okay.

416
00:51:29,498 --> 00:51:31,125
I heard the news.

417
00:51:32,701 --> 00:51:35,693
You still working that horse
I started for you?

418
00:51:35,771 --> 00:51:37,739
It's about the Nolt boy.

419
00:51:38,273 --> 00:51:39,570
What about him?

420
00:51:39,842 --> 00:51:41,571
They found a rock under his head.

421
00:51:41,644 --> 00:51:44,442
Like those other three fellows
from Brown's Hole.

422
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,271
You seen Joe Belle around?

423
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:50,250
The Association sent him up
to talk to Coble.

424
00:51:50,753 --> 00:51:54,245
Trying to figure what they're gonna do
with a child killer like Tom Horn.

425
00:51:54,323 --> 00:51:56,018
People think you did it.

426
00:52:00,729 --> 00:52:03,698
You don't understand what's going on,
do you?

427
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,668
No, I can't say as I do.

428
00:52:07,436 --> 00:52:09,301
What are you thinking?

429
00:52:09,872 --> 00:52:12,067
I'm thinking I want a drink.

430
00:52:50,946 --> 00:52:52,436
Whiskey, George.

431
00:53:01,123 --> 00:53:02,750
Leave the bottle.

432
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,338
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right, Charles.

433
00:53:23,345 --> 00:53:26,246
- Let's get started.
- What'll I need, Joe?

434
00:53:26,515 --> 00:53:28,210
Just your writing things.

435
00:53:28,283 --> 00:53:29,773
Where's Tom Horn?

436
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:32,352
He's over to the Interocean Hotel.

437
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:35,819
What kind of condition is he in?

438
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:40,861
He'll be just about where we want him
by the time we get set up.

439
00:53:41,163 --> 00:53:42,255
Come on over here.

440
00:53:42,331 --> 00:53:44,959
We got a mattress laid out here
for you behind the door.

441
00:53:45,033 --> 00:53:48,127
- Can you write okay lying down?
- Can you rig me a little light?

442
00:53:48,203 --> 00:53:49,670
Absolutely.

443
00:53:50,205 --> 00:53:54,198
Got the bottom of the door planed off
so you can hear real good.

444
00:53:54,576 --> 00:53:56,771
But you got to be real quiet.

445
00:53:57,045 --> 00:53:59,809
Joe, what if Tom Horn sees me in there?

446
00:54:01,416 --> 00:54:03,748
- You mean, will he kill you?
- Yes.

447
00:54:04,787 --> 00:54:07,119
I'm not going to let that happen, Charles.

448
00:54:07,189 --> 00:54:09,521
A man like that you don't want
to get mad at you.

449
00:54:09,591 --> 00:54:12,219
I'm going to be sitting
right over there at my desk.

450
00:54:12,294 --> 00:54:14,558
I've got this Colt patent.44 in my vest...

451
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,428
and a German automatic
over there in the drawer...

452
00:54:17,499 --> 00:54:19,865
one of the new ones. What I need is...

453
00:54:19,935 --> 00:54:23,302
for Tom Horn to talk himself
into a terrible tangle...

454
00:54:23,372 --> 00:54:25,340
and for you to get it down on paper.

455
00:54:25,407 --> 00:54:28,501
It's no good for us
just to write it down later.

456
00:54:28,677 --> 00:54:30,668
You mean it has to be in his own words?

457
00:54:30,746 --> 00:54:33,180
Just like I said, Charles.

458
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:47,193
Hello, Tom.

459
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,162
Hello, Joe.

460
00:54:50,332 --> 00:54:53,699
I got a letter yesterday
from a fellow up in Montana.

461
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:55,627
What'd he want?

462
00:54:56,805 --> 00:54:59,831
I'm not so sure
this is the spot to be talking.

463
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:03,372
Got a bottle of mescal in my office,
and it's quiet.

464
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:05,438
Sure.

465
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:26,460
You've spent some time in the hills,
haven't you?

466
00:55:26,535 --> 00:55:28,400
Most of my life, Tom.

467
00:55:29,271 --> 00:55:32,604
- But the world is changing fast.
- I can see that.

468
00:55:34,276 --> 00:55:36,676
And a man had better get with it.

469
00:55:37,246 --> 00:55:40,647
I've been trying to work
a few things out in my mind.

470
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:45,210
Staying in a hotel and being able
to get a drink right away seems to help.

471
00:55:46,421 --> 00:55:49,447
Think you'll ever get back
in them hills again?

472
00:55:49,524 --> 00:55:52,118
I don't know. Scares me to death.

473
00:56:06,141 --> 00:56:10,373
I see you're carrying a belly gun.
I've never known you to do that before.

474
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:12,970
Well, carrying a rifle in town and all...

475
00:56:17,452 --> 00:56:19,920
I got this inquiry from Montana...

476
00:56:19,988 --> 00:56:23,617
for a man who could come up there
and see to himself...

477
00:56:24,826 --> 00:56:27,090
and look to a few things that-a-way...

478
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:32,323
in respect to the cattle stealing going on
in the Big Moon up there in that district.

479
00:56:32,401 --> 00:56:35,564
- What's required?
- Some ability with a rifle.

480
00:56:42,377 --> 00:56:46,336
You know, Joe,
nobody ever offered to give me an office.

481
00:56:47,549 --> 00:56:50,916
- Make you feel kind of special, does it?
- I don't know.

482
00:56:51,586 --> 00:56:53,781
If I had your ability with a rifle...

483
00:56:53,855 --> 00:56:56,847
nobody would ever expect me
to come in out of the field.

484
00:56:56,925 --> 00:56:59,689
As it is, I spend half my time
on the railroad...

485
00:56:59,795 --> 00:57:03,424
handcuffed to some petty criminal,
as just a delivery man.

486
00:57:05,267 --> 00:57:08,031
What's the best shot you ever made, Tom?

487
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:10,037
I don't know.

488
00:57:11,606 --> 00:57:13,471
What about Mendenhour?

489
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:17,170
If it was me,
I'd say it wasn't much of a shot.

490
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:24,511
Wouldn't you rather shoot a Sharps.50
instead of that.45-.60?

491
00:57:24,586 --> 00:57:27,783
Those old buffalo guns carry better,
but with a.45-.60...

492
00:57:27,856 --> 00:57:31,519
you can get rounds at any general store.
Keeps a drygulcher in business.

493
00:57:32,294 --> 00:57:34,728
Tom, on the killing of this kid...

494
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:37,425
- that was quite a shot.
- Was it?

495
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:40,794
Two hundred thirteen yards.

496
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:43,865
What do you know about that?

497
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:45,970
What I just told you.

498
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:49,902
You afraid of dying, Joe?

499
00:57:53,548 --> 00:57:55,243
Yes, I am.

500
00:57:57,919 --> 00:58:02,288
I am afraid of losing my ability
to be able to come and go as I please.

501
00:58:02,657 --> 00:58:04,386
Lose my freedom.

502
00:58:04,893 --> 00:58:07,794
Not be able to get back up
in those hills again.

503
00:58:07,863 --> 00:58:09,592
What would they do to a man...

504
00:58:09,664 --> 00:58:12,326
that killed a 15-year-old boy
with a Winchester?

505
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:14,767
I believe that man would have to die.

506
00:58:14,903 --> 00:58:19,067
And you believe that a.45-.60
that's got a trajectory like a rainbow...

507
00:58:19,141 --> 00:58:20,665
could make that shot?

508
00:58:21,476 --> 00:58:23,376
I know it could happen.

509
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,547
If I'd have killed that kid...

510
00:58:33,622 --> 00:58:36,182
it would have been
the best shot I ever made...

511
00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:38,590
and the dirtiest trick I ever done.

512
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,690
Hello, Sam.

513
01:00:20,595 --> 01:00:24,326
I'm going to have to arrest you
for the murder of Jimmy Nolt.

514
01:00:24,399 --> 01:00:27,300
Taking yourself kind of serious, ain't you?

515
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:31,105
What are you going to do
with that Winchester?

516
01:00:31,573 --> 01:00:34,542
We're just going to have to find out,
ain't we?

517
01:00:40,649 --> 01:00:42,446
Yeah, I guess we are.

518
01:00:43,618 --> 01:00:45,643
I'll take that rifle, Tom.

519
01:00:51,593 --> 01:00:52,992
Hello, Earl.

520
01:01:03,438 --> 01:01:05,099
And the belly gun.

521
01:01:10,145 --> 01:01:11,669
Come on, Tom.

522
01:01:22,924 --> 01:01:24,858
Wait right there, Tom.

523
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:33,231
Don't put that pistol in that drawer.
Keep it in your pocket.

524
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:39,363
You got anything in your pockets, Tom?

525
01:01:39,441 --> 01:01:41,875
I got some Indian stuff here...

526
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:45,603
some shells in a sheepskin,
a little bit of change.

527
01:01:52,621 --> 01:01:53,986
You ready?

528
01:01:57,759 --> 01:02:00,887
No, upstairs. Bill, you stay down here.

529
01:02:34,729 --> 01:02:36,959
I'm going to put you in this one.

530
01:02:37,032 --> 01:02:39,262
I know how you love those hills.

531
01:02:39,334 --> 01:02:41,859
You can see a little bit of them from here.

532
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:46,597
Don't close that door until I get over
to that window, would you?

533
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:22,666
Is it true Horn worked for the Association?

534
01:03:23,511 --> 01:03:24,808
I've nothing to say on that.

535
01:03:24,879 --> 01:03:27,541
Is the Association going to pay
for his defense?

536
01:03:27,615 --> 01:03:29,845
I told you, I have no more to say.

537
01:03:49,804 --> 01:03:51,669
John Coble to see you.

538
01:03:57,779 --> 01:03:59,713
This is Thomas Burke.

539
01:03:59,781 --> 01:04:01,942
He'll be your legal counsel now.

540
01:04:02,617 --> 01:04:03,982
Every boy needs one of those.

541
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:07,021
Mr. Burke's the man
to put an end to all this for you.

542
01:04:07,088 --> 01:04:09,955
- I ain't got no money to pay you.
- I'll pay that.

543
01:04:10,024 --> 01:04:12,720
They're going to have you
come to court very quickly.

544
01:04:12,794 --> 01:04:14,762
Have you ever been tried
for anything before?

545
01:04:14,829 --> 01:04:18,162
Yeah, once.
It was a military trial a long time ago.

546
01:04:18,566 --> 01:04:21,933
- A couple of scouts and myself.
- What were you charged with?

547
01:04:22,003 --> 01:04:23,732
Invasion of Mexico.

548
01:04:25,607 --> 01:04:28,872
Tom, I have to move on with this
as quick as I can.

549
01:04:29,277 --> 01:04:31,074
You think I killed that boy?

550
01:04:31,146 --> 01:04:33,171
That question will never come up
between us.

551
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:35,978
Why not? It's going to come up in court.

552
01:04:39,687 --> 01:04:41,018
When do I go to trial?

553
01:04:41,089 --> 01:04:43,922
They're bringing in a judge
and swearing in a jury right now.

554
01:04:43,992 --> 01:04:46,460
I'd like to set up a time
we could get together...

555
01:04:46,528 --> 01:04:48,086
and maybe make a preparation or two.

556
01:04:48,163 --> 01:04:50,688
What for?
What are we going to talk about...

557
01:04:50,765 --> 01:04:53,996
if we don't talk about
whether I killed that kid or not?

558
01:04:54,068 --> 01:04:57,560
Mr. Burke, I'd like to talk to Tom
alone for a minute.

559
01:05:03,878 --> 01:05:06,438
You ever see so many bars in your life?

560
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:10,645
I guess that's why they call it a jail.

561
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:14,747
- I've been free all my life, John.
- I know that.

562
01:05:14,856 --> 01:05:18,417
Look, it's damn important
you don't try to break out of here.

563
01:05:18,493 --> 01:05:22,725
I know you can do it,
but it's just admitting your guilt if you try.

564
01:05:24,065 --> 01:05:27,728
Christ, I can see those hills over there,
but I can't touch them.

565
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,308
Cowboys.

566
01:05:54,896 --> 01:05:56,295
Schoolteachers.

567
01:05:59,701 --> 01:06:01,794
You sure are good company.

568
01:06:04,405 --> 01:06:06,873
Yes, but do you care for me?

569
01:06:12,247 --> 01:06:13,509
That horse over there...

570
01:06:13,581 --> 01:06:15,640
is the only thing I've owned
for a long time.

571
01:06:15,717 --> 01:06:17,651
He thinks the whole world of me...

572
01:06:17,719 --> 01:06:20,313
and I've never even given him a name.

573
01:06:20,755 --> 01:06:22,518
Was he good company?

574
01:06:23,424 --> 01:06:24,516
Yeah.

575
01:06:24,726 --> 01:06:27,559
- Do you care for him?
- Yes, I do.

576
01:06:29,898 --> 01:06:31,923
Tom, you're an idiot.

577
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:34,858
Yeah, I know.

578
01:06:44,145 --> 01:06:47,205
- What happened to your tooth there?
- Chipped it.

579
01:06:47,549 --> 01:06:49,210
How'd you do that?

580
01:06:49,717 --> 01:06:52,709
Riding horses. I've been riding all my life.

581
01:07:03,331 --> 01:07:04,628
Get down!

582
01:07:33,861 --> 01:07:35,260
Get dressed.

583
01:07:54,782 --> 01:07:58,183
How about giving me back
those Indian charms of mine?

584
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:07,060
They're just sentimental value,
nothing more.

585
01:08:14,202 --> 01:08:18,400
Earl, get Tom's Indian stuff
and bring it up here, will you?

586
01:08:20,074 --> 01:08:21,541
Anything else you want?

587
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:23,941
- Well, my rifle.
- No.

588
01:08:24,245 --> 01:08:27,009
- How about a nice fast horse?
- No.

589
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:32,251
You getting all choky
seeing me behind bars?

590
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,981
God damn you.

591
01:08:38,626 --> 01:08:40,924
- What are these buttons for?
- Just lucky.

592
01:08:40,995 --> 01:08:43,623
- The paper said they're charms.
- Yeah, they are.

593
01:08:43,698 --> 01:08:46,166
- Said you believed in them.
- I do.

594
01:08:46,234 --> 01:08:48,634
- Show me how they work.
- Someday.

595
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:51,136
Who are those fellows out there
with those rifles?

596
01:08:51,205 --> 01:08:52,570
That's the National Guard.

597
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,575
The paper said they didn't think
we could hold you in jail...

598
01:08:55,643 --> 01:08:58,339
and they got kind of personal about it.

599
01:09:18,866 --> 01:09:21,801
Open this thing up, Earl. Let us in.

600
01:09:24,072 --> 01:09:26,404
John Coble's here to see Tom.

601
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,237
Here you go.

602
01:09:33,514 --> 01:09:36,483
John brought you a suit
to wear at the trial.

603
01:09:39,554 --> 01:09:42,523
All right, you fellows can have
about 10 minutes.

604
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:44,189
Come on, Earl.

605
01:09:47,595 --> 01:09:51,326
It's real important that
you let Burke guide you in court.

606
01:09:52,433 --> 01:09:56,665
And you be as closed-mouthed as you can
around that prosecuting attorney.

607
01:09:56,738 --> 01:09:59,229
- Who is he?
- His name's Walter Stoll.

608
01:10:00,108 --> 01:10:03,874
He is effective.
They say he's running for office again...

609
01:10:04,612 --> 01:10:07,513
and this trial will be
kind of a showground for him.

610
01:10:08,349 --> 01:10:11,113
If he convicts you, he'll be a big hero.

611
01:10:13,154 --> 01:10:15,714
He needs to hang you to get elected.

612
01:10:19,193 --> 01:10:21,457
I'm sorry I got you into this.

613
01:10:21,629 --> 01:10:25,463
You could have been riding
right through this two-bit town.

614
01:10:27,135 --> 01:10:30,832
- People been trying to kill me all my life.
- I've got to tell you something.

615
01:10:30,905 --> 01:10:33,237
I knew the Association wanted
to get rid of you...

616
01:10:33,307 --> 01:10:35,172
because they told me.

617
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:38,078
But I just didn't know what to do. They...

618
01:10:39,247 --> 01:10:41,374
I didn't know nothing about...

619
01:10:41,549 --> 01:10:43,073
the Nolt boy...

620
01:10:43,651 --> 01:10:45,448
or how it happened, but...

621
01:10:46,621 --> 01:10:49,419
Who the hell could have done
such a thing?

622
01:10:51,325 --> 01:10:53,156
But I know one thing.

623
01:10:53,427 --> 01:10:55,520
You never killed that kid.

624
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:04,494
I figure folks would have to do
something about me sooner or later...

625
01:11:04,572 --> 01:11:06,631
the frontier closed and all.

626
01:11:07,074 --> 01:11:11,238
I never knew anybody that knew anything
but just killing and getting killed.

627
01:11:12,847 --> 01:11:15,281
After a while, it's all you know.

628
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:19,786
Now listen,
if it all goes wrong in there for me...

629
01:11:20,655 --> 01:11:22,953
I know you're my friend, John...

630
01:11:23,691 --> 01:11:26,182
and I know that you care about me.

631
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:31,890
Now sit down,
and I'll whip your ass at checkers.

632
01:12:18,846 --> 01:12:19,835
Good day.

633
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:31,948
That's fine, Tom.

634
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:12,393
Tom, you can step up
to the counsel's table here.

635
01:13:13,334 --> 01:13:14,961
Earl, back over here.

636
01:13:15,136 --> 01:13:16,967
You boys split up.

637
01:13:18,806 --> 01:13:20,205
The Honorable Judge Scott.

638
01:13:20,274 --> 01:13:22,469
This court is now in session.

639
01:13:22,743 --> 01:13:25,234
Mr. Ohnhouse,
you were in the next room at the time...

640
01:13:25,313 --> 01:13:26,974
under the orders of Marshal Belle...

641
01:13:27,048 --> 01:13:29,516
and you listened very carefully
to the conversation...

642
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:31,983
between Marshal Belle and Mr. Horn.
Is that correct?

643
01:13:35,289 --> 01:13:36,551
Yes.

644
01:13:36,924 --> 01:13:40,451
Will you tell the court exactly
what you took down at that time?

645
01:13:41,095 --> 01:13:44,929
The last thing Mr. Horn said
before leaving Joe Belle's office was:

646
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:46,525
"When I shot that kid...

647
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,227
"it was the best shot I ever made...

648
01:13:48,302 --> 01:13:50,167
"and the dirtiest trick I ever did."

649
01:13:57,378 --> 01:13:59,676
I want order in this courtroom.

650
01:13:59,747 --> 01:14:01,214
Your witness.

651
01:14:01,315 --> 01:14:02,543
No questions.

652
01:14:02,616 --> 01:14:04,277
You may step down.

653
01:14:08,389 --> 01:14:10,880
The prosecution calls Mr. Tom Horn.

654
01:14:21,068 --> 01:14:24,834
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth...

655
01:14:24,905 --> 01:14:26,532
so help you God?

656
01:14:26,907 --> 01:14:29,637
Did you listen carefully
to contents of the transcription...

657
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,974
as read by Mr. Ohnhouse to the court?

658
01:14:32,813 --> 01:14:33,837
Yes, I did.

659
01:14:33,914 --> 01:14:38,442
And you understand that this is a record
of your conversation with Marshal Belle?

660
01:14:38,753 --> 01:14:42,621
Well, it was "Mr. Horn said this"
and "Mr. Belle said that."

661
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,818
I don't follow.

662
01:14:46,894 --> 01:14:49,021
What I'm trying to get you to understand...

663
01:14:49,096 --> 01:14:52,259
is that that was a conversation
between me and Joe Belle.

664
01:14:53,034 --> 01:14:55,093
I understood that. Do you?

665
01:14:55,469 --> 01:14:56,800
Yes, I do.

666
01:14:57,271 --> 01:15:00,866
Do you consider it an accurate
transcription of that conversation?

667
01:15:00,941 --> 01:15:03,205
You'll have to ask that fellow
that wrote it down.

668
01:15:03,277 --> 01:15:05,768
I don't know how good he was at it.

669
01:15:07,214 --> 01:15:09,011
Can you offer us an opinion?

670
01:15:10,151 --> 01:15:12,517
What did you say your name was?

671
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,083
Walter Stoll.
I'm prosecuting you for murder.

672
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:19,655
Well, Mr. Stoll, I was just a little drunk.

673
01:15:20,528 --> 01:15:21,722
Why?

674
01:15:22,029 --> 01:15:24,088
Because I'd been drinking.

675
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,568
What's your problem now?

676
01:15:31,272 --> 01:15:33,001
I didn't understand you.

677
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,505
We're trying you for murder,
for a capital offense.

678
01:15:36,811 --> 01:15:40,212
So far, no one has had much success
in getting your attention.

679
01:15:40,281 --> 01:15:42,943
Well, I've been in jail.

680
01:15:44,685 --> 01:15:46,448
You've been in jail?

681
01:15:47,221 --> 01:15:50,190
What has that got to do
with your lackadaisical response...

682
01:15:50,257 --> 01:15:52,191
to the questions of the court?

683
01:15:52,293 --> 01:15:53,783
I'm a little bored.

684
01:15:53,861 --> 01:15:57,194
What Prosecutor Stoll is trying
to apprise you of is that...

685
01:15:57,264 --> 01:15:59,095
we're trying to decide whether or not...

686
01:15:59,166 --> 01:16:02,192
you're guilty of a crime
for which you should be hung.

687
01:16:02,436 --> 01:16:04,961
You're gonna do what you have to do.

688
01:16:05,473 --> 01:16:08,567
Do you object to the assertion
of Marshal Belle...

689
01:16:08,642 --> 01:16:10,803
that you killed Jimmy Nolt?

690
01:16:11,812 --> 01:16:15,111
That was your reply
in the transcribed conversation.

691
01:16:18,552 --> 01:16:19,814
Mr. Horn?

692
01:16:21,122 --> 01:16:23,522
Did anybody see me kill that kid?

693
01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:27,359
There were not, and you know it,
any witnesses.

694
01:16:27,428 --> 01:16:30,920
I think what the prosecutor is trying
to say to you is that...

695
01:16:30,998 --> 01:16:33,728
we would keenly like
to have you reply specifically...

696
01:16:33,801 --> 01:16:36,668
to the accusation that you killed this boy.

697
01:16:37,438 --> 01:16:40,669
You want me to say
whether I did or I didn't do it?

698
01:16:40,908 --> 01:16:42,398
In effect, yes...

699
01:16:42,476 --> 01:16:45,502
although a plea of innocence
has been entered.

700
01:16:45,646 --> 01:16:49,480
I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.
Now, whether you or Stoll...

701
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:52,314
or that sold-out,
son-of-a-bitching marshal Joe Belle...

702
01:16:52,386 --> 01:16:54,581
want to see me guilty, you go right ahead.

703
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,852
But I'm not going to give you
any more satisfaction than I have to.

704
01:16:57,925 --> 01:17:00,393
Whether you shoot me or hang me...

705
01:17:00,461 --> 01:17:02,793
or take my rifle or my horse...

706
01:17:03,564 --> 01:17:05,657
one reason is as good as another.

707
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:09,734
And I believe that, I do.
That's my last word on this matter.

708
01:17:14,074 --> 01:17:16,167
I want order in this court.

709
01:17:17,411 --> 01:17:21,142
In the interest of a fair trial,
I'm going to suggest...

710
01:17:21,882 --> 01:17:25,511
there's something about our proceedings
which seem to elude Mr. Horn here.

711
01:17:25,586 --> 01:17:27,781
But forgiving, I'm going to suggest...

712
01:17:27,855 --> 01:17:30,323
that his life
in the lawless parts of our country...

713
01:17:30,391 --> 01:17:34,418
have left him entirely unfamiliar
with the processes of the law.

714
01:17:34,695 --> 01:17:36,162
And I strongly suggest...

715
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:38,698
that someone who is interested
in his welfare...

716
01:17:38,766 --> 01:17:40,461
educate him in our ways.

717
01:17:40,534 --> 01:17:43,025
I'm not sure it is necessary to point out...

718
01:17:43,103 --> 01:17:45,970
that it is his life which is in question here.

719
01:17:53,547 --> 01:17:55,481
It's cold in the night.

720
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:10,958
I've been kind of down on my luck lately,
and I want to try to revive it.

721
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,730
This may sound kind of off-center to you...

722
01:18:15,803 --> 01:18:19,500
but I want to take my Indian charms
and set them under my bunk tonight.

723
01:18:19,573 --> 01:18:23,270
So when you come in the morning
to give me my breakfast, I'd appreciate it...

724
01:18:23,344 --> 01:18:25,244
if you didn't look at them.

725
01:18:25,446 --> 01:18:26,879
I'll probably be asleep...

726
01:18:26,947 --> 01:18:30,041
because I'll be up
most of the night, thinking.

727
01:18:30,751 --> 01:18:32,082
Sure, Tom.

728
01:19:37,584 --> 01:19:39,108
Two bourbons.

729
01:19:39,186 --> 01:19:41,450
What I'm trying to prove, Philip...

730
01:19:41,522 --> 01:19:45,652
is that criminals like Tom Horn
are not immune to prosecution.

731
01:19:46,026 --> 01:19:48,586
The newspapers and the legal profession...

732
01:19:48,662 --> 01:19:50,892
are going to set things straight
in this country.

733
01:19:50,964 --> 01:19:53,899
And our system of justice insures that...

734
01:19:54,234 --> 01:19:58,170
killers like Tom Horn
get exactly what they deserve.

735
01:19:58,238 --> 01:20:00,502
And I'm going to see that it happens.

736
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:50,738
Where are the rifles in here?

737
01:22:50,811 --> 01:22:53,279
The sheriff said we can't keep them
in here no longer.

738
01:22:53,347 --> 01:22:54,837
- You got a gun?
- No.

739
01:22:55,082 --> 01:22:56,845
You going to kill me?

740
01:22:56,984 --> 01:23:00,920
You and I are walking out of here,
and you're going to smile. Now smile!

741
01:23:04,992 --> 01:23:06,619
Keep smiling.

742
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:08,322
Smile.

743
01:23:09,596 --> 01:23:12,531
Listen, I've got a.41 caliber in your back.

744
01:25:38,245 --> 01:25:41,578
You damn fools.
What are you trying to do, kill him?

745
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:44,910
Shit.

746
01:25:45,352 --> 01:25:46,910
You damn fools.

747
01:25:57,964 --> 01:26:00,398
<i>Has the jury arrived at a verdict?</i>

748
01:26:00,934 --> 01:26:02,663
<i>Yes, we have, Your Honor.</i>

749
01:26:02,736 --> 01:26:05,967
<i>The jury finds the defendant,</i>
<i>Tom Horn, guilty.</i>

750
01:26:06,707 --> 01:26:09,801
<i>The court finds you guilty</i>
<i>of murder as charged.</i>

751
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:13,802
<i>You are sentenced to be hanged</i>
<i>by the neck until dead...</i>

752
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:17,145
<i>between the hours</i>
<i>of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a. m...</i>

753
01:26:17,217 --> 01:26:20,584
<i>on November 20, 1903.</i>

754
01:26:21,321 --> 01:26:23,881
<i>May the Lord have mercy on your soul.</i>

755
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:46,839
Someday, you're going to have to pay
for your way of life, Tom.

756
01:26:47,748 --> 01:26:50,182
You're a bad man and I know it.

757
01:26:51,151 --> 01:26:54,951
And if I let you talk me out of it,
I'll be lost forever.

758
01:26:58,592 --> 01:27:01,857
And my adventures in this life
won't mean anything...

759
01:27:02,329 --> 01:27:05,093
because you will have seduced my soul...

760
01:27:05,165 --> 01:27:07,065
and drawn me into your world.

761
01:27:11,138 --> 01:27:12,537
Goodbye, Tom.

762
01:27:25,585 --> 01:27:27,610
Has his weight been varying much
here in jail?

763
01:27:27,687 --> 01:27:29,746
I don't believe so.
It's stayed about the same.

764
01:27:29,823 --> 01:27:32,656
- Do you know how tall he is?
- I ain't sure.

765
01:27:46,306 --> 01:27:48,103
All right, Tom. Step out.

766
01:27:52,779 --> 01:27:54,644
Up on the scales.

767
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:58,675
What's this for?

768
01:27:58,985 --> 01:28:01,579
I'm designing your gallows, Mr. Horn.

769
01:28:01,888 --> 01:28:06,689
I've got to get the weights exactly right.
If this thing works the way I designed it...

770
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:11,522
you should fall absolutely straight, stop,
and make a half-turn to the right.

771
01:28:13,166 --> 01:28:15,657
- Will I be alive or dead?
- When?

772
01:28:16,369 --> 01:28:19,133
When I make that half-turn to the right.

773
01:28:19,673 --> 01:28:21,436
You should be dead.

774
01:28:22,008 --> 01:28:24,704
Nobody wants to spring the trap on you.

775
01:28:25,378 --> 01:28:28,814
Mr. Julian here is designing
something special for us.

776
01:28:29,416 --> 01:28:31,145
The trap is water operated.

777
01:28:31,218 --> 01:28:33,482
Christ, you ain't
going to drown me, are you?

778
01:28:33,553 --> 01:28:36,249
No. You just step onto the platform...

779
01:28:36,323 --> 01:28:38,348
and your weight will activate
a water valve...

780
01:28:38,425 --> 01:28:40,655
that finally springs the trap.

781
01:28:43,163 --> 01:28:45,290
All right, step back inside.

782
01:28:56,276 --> 01:28:58,471
Do I spring that trap myself?

783
01:28:59,412 --> 01:29:00,640
Exactly.

784
01:29:02,048 --> 01:29:04,380
Makes me feel like I'm committing suicide.

785
01:29:04,451 --> 01:29:07,477
You suppose that's what I've been doing
all these years, Sam?

786
01:29:07,554 --> 01:29:09,613
Don't ask me that, Tom.

787
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:11,657
Bring the scales.

788
01:29:11,992 --> 01:29:13,755
Come on, Mr. Julian.

789
01:30:12,585 --> 01:30:14,246
Tom, it's time.

790
01:30:28,735 --> 01:30:31,135
I'm gonna have to strap you up, Tom.

791
01:30:53,093 --> 01:30:56,961
Earl, I'm sorry I busted your head
so hard against those bars.

792
01:30:59,332 --> 01:31:01,095
That's all right, Tom.

793
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:05,968
This is Father J. P. Rank.

794
01:31:06,973 --> 01:31:09,771
- How do you do?
- Fine, Tom. You?

795
01:31:13,913 --> 01:31:17,144
- How long you had that Bible?
- Twenty-eight years.

796
01:31:18,618 --> 01:31:20,813
Got her about bucked out yet?

797
01:31:21,221 --> 01:31:22,813
I think so.

798
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:28,623
- You ready?
- Yeah.

799
01:31:58,091 --> 01:32:01,959
- I understand you're getting married, son.
- Yes, I am, Mr. Horn.

800
01:32:02,028 --> 01:32:04,326
You take good care of her, now.

801
01:32:12,539 --> 01:32:14,166
Right there, Tom.

802
01:33:03,256 --> 01:33:06,419
Keep your nerve, Sam,
because I'm going to keep mine.

803
01:33:39,159 --> 01:33:41,787
All right. Tom, step back on the trap.

804
01:33:50,036 --> 01:33:51,230
There.

805
01:34:36,282 --> 01:34:37,749
Sam, I've never seen...

806
01:34:37,817 --> 01:34:40,581
such a pasty-faced bunch of sheriffs
in my life.

807
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:28,412
English
