1
00:00:44,388 --> 00:00:47,100
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

2
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:53,496
LOOKS LIKE A GRAVEYARD.

3
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:56,499
THAT'S 'CAUSE HONEST FOLKS
GO TO BED EARLY.

4
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:58,800
NO KIDDIN'.

5
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:00,936
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU GOT?

6
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:03,672
I GOT SIX BITS,
BUT I NEED TO EAT.

7
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,644
I GOT A DOLLAR, JACK,
BUT I GOTTA TAKE A BATH.

8
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:11,247
LOOKS LIKE 11 CENTS.

9
00:01:11,314 --> 00:01:12,748
FORK IT OVER.

10
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:14,283
WHAT?

11
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:19,621
COME ON,

00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:59,345
ONE BEER.
WE'LL SHARE IT.

19
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:01,930

WE'RE DROVERS.

30
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:37,633
DEALER TAKES THREE

31
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,868

32
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:47,042

SEE BET.

36
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:55,651

FULL HOUSE.
KINGS OVER DEUCES.

49
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:49,771
HOW ABOUT YOU?

50
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,373

00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:02,651
I'M NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH.

00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,521
I KNOWED THEM BOYS.

57
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:07,523
THEY NEVER CHEATED NOBODY.

58
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,425
COME ON, WE GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.

59
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:11,660

60
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:13,596
COME ON,

61
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:15,163
YOU DIRTY,
ROTTEN BASTARDS!

62
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,701
SHUT UP, WHORE!

63
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,403
WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

64
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,105
YOU THINK YOU'RE
TOUGHER THAN ME?

65
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:27,610
YOU'RE NOT ANYTHING.

66
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:30,078
YOU PEOPLE LISTEN TO ME.

67
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:34,083

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,752
AND I'M NOT

69
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,287

AND I'LL AVENGE MYSELF

71
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:42,591

72
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,760
( Jack )
SO WHEN THE LAW
COMES, YOU TELL 'EM.

73
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:51,250
TELL 'EM I'M NOT

74
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:16,945
TOM.

75
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:25,721
SIR.

76
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:27,189
YOU GREW UP, SIR.

77
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:30,759
I SUPPOSE I DID.

78
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:36,898
GIVE ME THAT.

79
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:42,371
WE RUN 3,000 HEAD
ON 50,000 ACRES.

80
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,275
NICE SIZE. HOUSE IS ABOUT
A MILE UP THE ROAD.

81
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:47,776
I HOPE IT HAS BEDS.

82
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:51,947
YEAH. NEW PRIVIES, TOO.
JUST DUG 'EM.

83
00:07:52,015 --> 00:07:54,250
THAT'S NICE TO KNOW.

84
00:07:54,317 --> 00:07:57,853
YOU'LL LIKE LOTTIE.
SHE'S GOOD PEOPLE.

85
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,222
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING HER.

86
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:06,362
SHE'S A HELL OF A COOK.

87
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:11,833
IS THIS HIM?

88
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:13,502
THIS IS LOTTIE.

89
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,836
HOW DO YOU DO?

90
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:18,740
IT IS SO GOOD
TO MEET YOU!

91
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:22,611
HE IS JUST BEAUTIFUL!

92
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:24,880
YOUR DADDY HAS TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU,

93
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:27,383
I FEEL LIKE
I ALREADY KNOW YOU.

94
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,085
I BELIEVE HE'S TALLER
THAN YOU ARE.

95
00:08:30,153 --> 00:08:31,169
SMARTER, TOO.

96
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:32,521
I DOUBT IT.

97
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:38,661
WHAT ARE WE DOING OUT HERE?
LET'S GO INSIDE.

98
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:47,636
I BET YOU CAN
FIRE THIS A MILE.

99
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:51,340
YOU ALWAYS DID
ADMIRE THAT SHARPS.

100
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:56,412
SHOOTS TRUE TO 1,000 YARDS.
GENERAL CROOK GAVE IT TO ME.

101
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:59,682
I NEVER DID UNDERSTAND
THAT NAME HE GAVE ME, THOUGH.

102
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:04,019
"NEMESIS." NEMESIS
WAS THE GOD
OF RETRIBUTION.

103
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:07,389
HUNTED DOWN AND
PUNISHED THE WICKED.

104
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:09,391
COLLEGE MAN.

105
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:14,196
LAWYER, TOO.

106
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:17,599
WITH YOUR EDUCATION, THERE'S NO
LIMIT TO WHAT YOU CAN DO HERE.

107
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:21,470
REALLY PUT THIS PLACE
ON THE MAP.

108
00:09:21,538 --> 00:09:24,740
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
YOU HOME. I MISSED YOU.

109
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:26,792
IT'S GOOD TO
BE BACK, SIR.

110
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:27,976
YOU LIKE LOTTIE?

111
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:30,613
YES, I DO.

112
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,748
SHE'LL NEVER
TAKE YOUR MOM'S PLACE.

113
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:34,883
NO. I LIKE HER
VERY MUCH.

114
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:41,323
THAT REMINDS ME,
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

115
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:45,394
YOUR MOTHER GAVE ME THIS
JUST BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED.

116
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:46,962
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
LIKE TO HAVE IT.

117
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:53,636
THANK YOU.

118
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:55,638
( Tom )
SHE CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL.

119
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:59,275
SHE WAS THE PRETTIEST
WOMAN I EVER SAW.

120
00:09:59,342 --> 00:10:02,110
TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY.

121
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:07,716
SHE COULD SING,
PLAY THE SPINET,

122
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:10,218
RECITE POETRY.

123
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:13,522
GOD KNOWS WHAT
SHE EVER SAW IN ME.

124
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,958
SHE FOLLOWED YOU
OUT HERE, SIR.

125
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:23,965
IT'S AWFUL TO THINK
OF HER DYING SO YOUNG.

126
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:29,004
THIS IS A HARD LIFE OUT HERE.

127
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:39,548
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF MAYBE
SHE JUST WASN'T CUT OUT FOR IT.

128
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:40,982
THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN--

129
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,585
( Lottie )
DINNER'S ON THE TABLE!

130
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:48,724
WE BETTER GO.

131
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:55,331
MAKE A FUSS OVER DINNER.
SHE'S BEEN WORKING
AT IT ALL DAY.

132
00:10:55,398 --> 00:11:01,470
( hammering on anvil )

133
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:11,480
'EVENING.

134
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:13,181
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

135
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:16,352
WE WAS WONDERING IF
WE COULD REST OUR HORSES.

136
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:19,655
MAYBE GET A BITE TO EAT.

137
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:22,057
THE WOMAN'S GOT A STEW ON.

138
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:23,492
'EVENING, MA'AM.

139
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,527
GOOD EVENING.

140
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:28,797
SOMETHING SURE SMELLS
GOOD IN THERE.

141
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:31,400
THANK YOU!

142
00:11:31,468 --> 00:11:34,052
I'LL HAVE YOUR SIDE ARMS.

143
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,172
IT'S A HOUSE RULE HERE.

144
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:43,912
YES, SIR. CAN'T BE TOO
CAREFUL THESE DAYS.

145
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,914
WHERE YOU FELLERS FROM?

146
00:11:45,982 --> 00:11:48,917
DOWN HEELER COUNTY.
WE'RE DROVERS.

147
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:54,973
I GOT A HORSE HERE,
MIGHT HAVE A LOOSE SHOE.

148
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:01,730
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

149
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:03,899
THINK HE'LL NEED A NEW ONE?

150
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,167
( gunshot )

151
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:07,369
'MORNING, COME ON IN.

152
00:12:07,437 --> 00:12:08,704
'MORNING, SIR.

153
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:10,105
LOOK AT YOU.

154
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:13,909
STARTING TO LOOK
LIKE YOURSELF AGAIN.

155
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:15,977
YOU BUILT
REAL BUSY RIGHT NOW?

156
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:19,114
HELL, NO. THIS PAPERWORK
IS ABOUT TO SOUR MY STOMACH.

157
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:21,417
MAYBE I CAN TAKE
A LOOK AT IT FOR YOU.

158
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:27,556
I WISH YOU WOULD.

159
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,000
EVEN WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE,
YOU WERE ALWAYS READING.

160
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:41,703
I CAN REMEMBER LOOKING
IN ON YOU AT MIDNIGHT

161
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:44,172
AND YOUR LAMP
WOULD STILL BE BURNING.

162
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,174
BUT YOU'D HIDE YOUR
BOOK UNDER THE COVERS

163
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:50,011
AND PRETEND YOU WERE ASLEEP.

164
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,897
HOW'D YOU KNOW
I WAS PRETENDING?

165
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:54,015
I'D FEEL YOUR FOREHEAD.

166
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,118
EVER SINCE YOU WERE A BABY,
WHEN YOU WERE REALLY ASLEEP

167
00:12:57,186 --> 00:13:04,025
YOU'D GET A LITTLE
BEAD OF SWEAT RIGHT THERE.

168
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:05,727
SIR, I'VE GOT TO TALK TO YOU.

169
00:13:05,512 --> 00:13:10,966
FIRE AWAY.

170
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,301
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND

171
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:16,004
I'M VERY GRATEFUL
FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.

172
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:18,874
PAYING FOR MY EDUCATION
AND EVERYTHING.

173
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:24,212
IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

174
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,916
I'M NOT GONNA
BE STAYING HERE.

175
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:29,518
YOU'RE NOT?

176
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:31,653
NO, I'M GOING BACK
TO PHILADELPHIA.

177
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:33,622
UNCLE FLETCHER'S OFFERED

HERE.

180
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:46,067
SEE WHERE IT'S GOT
MY NAME AND EVERYTHING.

181
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:48,937
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE ALL SETTLED IN.

182
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:51,439
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'LL NEVER
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.

183
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:53,575
I'LL HAVE HOLIDAYS
AND WHEN I GET TIME--

184
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:57,946
LISTEN, A MAN'S GOT TO
GO HIS OWN WAY.

185
00:13:58,014 --> 00:13:59,314
WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING?

186
00:13:59,382 --> 00:14:02,551
ABOUT TWO WEEKS.

187
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:08,690
THEN WE BETTER MAKE THE MOST
OF THE TIME WE GOT LEFT.

188
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:21,703
( cows mooing )

189
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:26,508
WHY, LANE CRAWFORD.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN AN AGE!

190
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,476
'EVENING.

191
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:29,011
YOU ARE JUST IN
TIME FOR SUPPER.

192
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:30,145
THANK YOU,
MA'AM.

193
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:34,082
COME ON IN.

194
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,652
LOTTIE, THAT DINNER
WAS CAPITAL. JUST CAPITAL.

195
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,354
THANK YOU, LANE.

196
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:41,890
YOU BETTER SET A LITTLE FARTHER
FROM THE TROUGH.

197
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:45,293
YOU'RE STARTING
TO LOOK LIKE GROVER CLEVELAND.

198
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:48,997
YOU GO TO HELL, SIR.
EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE.

199
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:50,632
NOT TO WORRY.

200
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,800
WHY DON'T YOU MEN
GO OUT ON THE PORCH

201
00:14:52,868 --> 00:15:00,208
AND I'LL BRING THE
DRINKS AFTER I FINISH
CLEARING THE TABLE.

202
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:01,876
THANK YOU AGAIN,
MY DARLING.

203
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:08,016
CERTAINLY.

204
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:15,323
I GUESS I HURT
HIM, DIDN'T I?

205
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:19,261
HE THINKS THE
WORLD OF YOU.

206
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:21,796
REAL NICE PLACE
YOU GOT HERE, NOBLE.

207
00:15:21,864 --> 00:15:25,067
( Lane )
TOO BAD TOM'S NOT GONNA
BE HERE TO HELP YOU RUN IT.

208
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:30,004
GOT HIS OWN LIFE
TO LIVE, I GUESS.

209
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:35,710
BUT IT STILL SEEMS
KIND OF A WASTE.

210
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:39,447
DID YOU EVER HEAR OF A MAN
NAMED JOHN STILWELL?

211
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:43,485
( Lane )
CALLS HIMSELF RED JACK.

212
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:47,389
HIM AND THREE OF HIS BUDDIES
BUSTED OUT OF YUMA PRISON.

213
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:51,093
THEY'VE ALREADY
KILLED FIVE PEOPLE.

214
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,528
OWING TO THE FACT THAT
THEY'RE FEDERAL FUGITIVES,

215
00:15:53,596 --> 00:15:54,963
I GOT TO GO GET THEM.

216
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,032
WHY YOU TELLING ME THIS?

217
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:59,767
NEED A TRACKER.

218
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,736
PAYS $100 IN FOUND.

219
00:16:01,804 --> 00:16:05,207
SORRY, I'M RETIRED.

220
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:07,842
I SAID NO TO GENERAL CROOK.

221
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,346
THEY'LL RUN GERONIMO
DOWN THIS TIME.

222
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:19,087
I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY NO TO YOU.

223
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:23,057
GOT THIS PAIN IN MY SIDE.

224
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:26,961
HURTS LIKE A SON OF A BITCH
MOST OF THE TIME.

225
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,963
( Lane )
YOU REMEMBER.

226
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,633
I GOT IT AT MERENZE.

227
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,135
THAT BOHUNK
WOULD HAVE TOOK

228
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,303
YOUR HEAD OFF IF IT
HADN'T OF BEEN FOR ME.

229
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:39,741
GODDAMN YOU.

230
00:16:39,808 --> 00:16:41,343
CURSE ME ALL YOU WANT TO.

231
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:46,314
I CURSE MYSELF FOR
HAVING TO BRING IT UP.

232
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:52,720
BUT THE PLAIN FACT
OF THE MATTER IS
I'M GETTING OLD.

233
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:55,490
I NEED YA.

234
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:57,225
WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING?

235
00:16:57,293 --> 00:17:03,431
SOONER THE BETTER.

236
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:09,504
WHO'S THERE?

237
00:17:09,572 --> 00:17:14,842
JUST ME.

238
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,712
THEY TEACH YOU EAVESDROPPING
IN LAW SCHOOL?

239
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,515
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

240
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:24,118
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

241
00:17:24,187 --> 00:17:26,521
AFTER THOSE MEN.
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

242
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,955
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

243
00:17:28,023 --> 00:17:30,559
YES, I AM.
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

244
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:31,926
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,

245
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:33,961
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

246
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:35,830
I NEVER HAD
THE CHANCE.

247
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:38,032
IT'S NOT THE
TIME TO LEARN.

248
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,035
WE DON'T RIDE UP AND SERVE
A WARRANT ON THEIR FRONT PORCH.

249
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,804
I KNOW THAT.
I CAN HOLD MY OWN.

250
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:44,872
CAN YOU?

251
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,742
( Noble )
YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY IDEA.

252
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:53,881
THIS IS TRACKING A MAN DOWN
LIKE AN ANIMAL AND KILLING HIM.

253
00:17:57,753 --> 00:18:02,023
WE MIGHT COULD
USE A LITTLE HELP.

254
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:11,099
SOMEBODY TO MAKE COFFEE.
BRING ALONG THE PACKHORSE.

255
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:15,370
THIS IS NOT LAW SCHOOL.
YOU'D BE DOING THE DIRTY WORK.

256
00:18:15,438 --> 00:18:17,439
( Noble )
TAKING ORDERS.

257
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:21,509
IF YOU MESS UP, I'LL COME
DOWN ON YOU HARD.

258
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:27,649
I'LL GET MY
THINGS TOGETHER.

259
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:48,102
IT'S A SIDE OF ME
I HOPED HE'D NEVER SEE.

260
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:31,746
JOHNNY.

261
00:19:31,814 --> 00:19:34,081
MARSHAL.

262
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:37,936
NOBLE AND TOM ADAMS.
SHERIFF MURDOCK.

263
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:41,756
WORD IS OUT YOU'S
RIDING. MAKE 'EM STAND
STRAIGHT IT WILL.

264
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:44,693
SHOW IT TO 'EM.

265
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,866
YES, SIR.

266
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,518
"DANITE."
THAT RINGS A BELL.

267
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:16,107
MOUNTAIN MEADOWS
MASSACRE.

268
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:19,361
DANITES WERE
A BAND OF MORMONS.

269
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:25,199
GUNMEN. CALL THEMSELVES
AVENGING ANGELS.

270
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:31,038
IN '47, A WAGON TRAIN WAS
PASSING THROUGH CEDAR CITY.

271
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:34,976
DANITES KILLED EVERYBODY
EXCEPT THE INFANTS.

272
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:38,012
WORD HAS IT THAT THE
GOOD MORMONS IN THAT AREA

273
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,883
TOOK IN THE ORPHANS AND
RAISED THEM AS THEIR OWN.

274
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,286
WAS STILWELL ONE OF THEM?

275
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:51,760
COULD'VE BEEN.

276
00:20:51,827 --> 00:20:56,998
I RECKON THEY'RE HEADED
FOR UTAH. THEY FIGURE
THEY'D BE SAFE THERE.

277
00:20:57,065 --> 00:21:00,402
WHERE DO WE START?

278
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:05,473
I NEED TO STOP
FOR WATER.

279
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:09,110
( Noble )
THERE. TRUSCOTT'S WELL.

280
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:12,213
RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND.

281
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:16,284
DO YOU SWEAR TO UPHOLD THE
LAWS AND THE CONSTITUTION
OF THE U.S.A

282
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:17,952
AND THE TERRITORY OF ARIZONA

283
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,255
AND TO PROTECT OUR CITIZENS,
EVEN AT THE COST OF YOUR LIFE?

284
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:27,395
I DO.

285
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:43,711
I'M HUNGRY. I WONDER WHAT TIME
THE SLOP HOUSES OPEN UP.

286
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:47,014
IT'LL BE A WHILE. IT'S SUNDAY.
PEOPLE GO TO CHURCH FIRST.

287
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:50,534
BROTHER JOHN.

288
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,620
WHO ARE YOU?

289
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,823
NOT TALKING TO YOU, SCUM.

290
00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:00,962
I'M ADDRESSING
BROTHER JOHN STILWELL.

291
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:05,800
ARE YOU A SAINT, FRIEND?

292
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:08,135
YES, I AM.

293
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:12,273
AND YOU ARE A LOATHSOME,
CRAWLING THING.

294
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:15,276
OLD BASTARD.

295
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:17,195
HOW DO YOU KNOW ME?

296
00:22:17,263 --> 00:22:19,814
I WAS IN THE WESTERN UNION
OFFICE LAST NIGHT

297
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:22,383
WHEN YOUR DESCRIPTION
CAME OVER THE WIRE.

298
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:24,686
SAID YOU WERE A SAINT,

299
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:27,321
SO I STAYED UP
ALL NIGHT TO WARN YOU.

300
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,625
FIGURED IT WAS MY DUTY
TO THE CHURCH.

301
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:33,694
WARN ME ABOUT WHAT?

302
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:37,598
THE GENTILES.
THEY'RE COMING TO GET YOU.

303
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:42,637
AND I CAN'T SAY
AS HOW I BLAME 'EM MUCH.

304
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:45,106
THAT'S BEEN TRIED BEFORE.

305
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:47,608
NOT LIKE THIS TIME, DANITE.

306
00:22:47,676 --> 00:22:51,412
THEY'VE SENT THEIR AVENGER,
NOBLE ADAMS.

307
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,548
ADAMS, COMING HERE?

308
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:57,602
BROUGHT YOU UP SHORT,
DIDN'T IT, FILTH?

309
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:02,590
EVEN THE APACHE
WERE SCARED OF ADAMS.

310
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:05,526
NOBLE ADAMS HIMSELF.

311
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:09,730
BE HERE NOON TOMORROW.

312
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:12,167
THANK YOU, BROTHER.

313
00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:16,137
DON'T THANK ME, FRIEND.
I HOPE HE GETS YOU.

314
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:22,610
STILL AND ALL,
A SAINT'S A SAINT.
MAY GOD HELP ME.

315
00:23:22,678 --> 00:23:29,551
THEY SURE STICK TOGETHER,
DON'T THEY?

316
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:32,353
NOBLE ADAMS

317
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:34,655
COMING AFTER ME.

318
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:36,891
COMING AFTER US.

319
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,194
WE BETTER GET TO COVER.

320
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:40,795
WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?

321
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:43,731
HE'S JUST ANOTHER STINKING
BULL, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

322
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:44,099
EVEN SO, MAYBE WE BETTER CALL IT
A DAY AND HEAD ON UP TO UTAH?

323
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:51,079
NOT JUST YET.

324
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:53,610
WHY NOT?

325
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:02,257
WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE
SOMETHING BEHIND

326
00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:07,228
FOR MR. NOBLE ADAMS TO FIND.

327
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:09,297
INEZ, HAVE YOU SEEN MY COAT?

328
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:14,770
I PRESSED IT FOR
YOU, MR. BOLTON.

329
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:18,373
GOOD.

330
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:21,915
NOW, WHERE'S MY HAT?

331
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:28,684
HEY, MARY!

332
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:31,553
YOUR SISTER SURE DOES
LOOK NICE TODAY, DOESN'T SHE?

333
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:33,822
SHE SHOULD!
SHE'S BEEN UP SINCE 7:00

334
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,124
GETTING HERSELF
ALL GUSSIED UP FOR YOU.

335
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:37,459
I WAS NOT.

336
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:39,527
YOU WERE TOO.

337
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:41,463
SEE YOU THERE.

338
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:47,603
I KNOW SOMETHING YOU DON'T!

339
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:04,653
WHO ARE YOU FELLAS?

340
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:06,554
'MORNING.

341
00:25:06,623 --> 00:25:11,009
WE WAS WONDERING MIGHT
YOU COULD SPARE SOME
WATER FOR OUR HORSES.

342
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:16,264
WHY DIDN'T YOU
COME AROUND THE FRONT?

343
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:19,234
WHERE YOU FELLAS FROM?

344
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:22,570
HEELER COUNTY.
WE'RE DROVERS.

345
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:29,945
HEELER COUNTY?

346
00:25:30,013 --> 00:25:33,214
MARY.

347
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:37,585
MAKES ME SICK THE WAY SARAH
MAKES SUCH COW EYES AT LON.

348
00:25:37,654 --> 00:25:38,820
SHE LIKES HIM.

349
00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:40,055
HE MAKES ME TIRED.

350
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:43,491
HE THINKS HE'S SO BIG.

351
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,960
WHAT A SAP.

352
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:47,529
YOU GO GET READY
FOR CHURCH NOW.

353
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:51,833
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO
CHURCH. I HATE CHURCH.

354
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:54,402
COME ON!

355
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,204
OH, WELL.

356
00:25:56,272 --> 00:26:02,678
NO!

357
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:17,993
BETTER NOT DROP THAT.
YOU'LL CATCH HELL FROM MY DAD.

358
00:26:18,061 --> 00:26:21,096
LOOK AT THAT.

359
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:24,532
A LITTLE PRINCESS.

360
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:31,139
JUST A LITTLE GIRL, JACK.

361
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:35,643
NOW

362
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:41,783
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

363
00:26:44,587 --> 00:26:47,355
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

364
00:26:47,423 --> 00:26:53,494
TAKE THE KID OUTSIDE.

365
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,404
THE NAVAJO GIRL'S NAME IS INEZ.
SHE'S A HOUSEKEEPER.

366
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:09,677
SHE AND THE YOUNG GIRL, MARY,
BEEN MISSING SINCE YESTERDAY.

367
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:20,421
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW SORRY I AM.

368
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:22,390
YOUR FATHER AND
I SWAPPED HORSES,

369
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,993
AND RAN CATTLE TOGETHER.

370
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:31,133
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

371
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:41,709
YOU'LL NEED SOMEPLACE
FOR YOUR SPARE HORSES.

372
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:47,849
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.

373
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:54,856
NOBLE.

374
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:58,093
TRAIL'S POINTED DUE NORTH.

375
00:27:58,161 --> 00:28:01,930
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
HEADED FOR UTAH.

376
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:04,399
WE BETTER CATCH 'EM
BEFORE THEY GET THERE

377
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:09,037
OR WE'LL NEVER GET
THOSE GIRLS BACK.

378
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:12,808
THOSE THREE ARE
THE NAVAJO GIRL'S BROTHERS.

379
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,943
THE ONE ON THE RIGHT,
NAMED TONIO.

380
00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:18,213
THEY WANT TO COME WITH US.

381
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:24,352
NO. I BETTER
TALK TO THEM.

382
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:42,904
YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME
WHEN YOU NEARLY FILLED
ME FULL OF BUCKSHOT?

383
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:46,374
YOU WERE RIDING HOME
IN A WAGON FULL OF TURNIPS

384
00:28:46,442 --> 00:28:52,480
AND I HELD YOU UP FOR
THE WELLS FARGO PAYMENT.

385
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:56,684
YOU WERE ALWAYS MAD
WHEN I GOT THE DROP ON YOU.

386
00:28:56,752 --> 00:29:00,722
I SAW YOU HALF
A MILE BACK THAT DAY.

387
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:03,191
YOU BEEN SAYING THAT
SINCE YOU WERE 8 YEARS OLD

388
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:09,497
BUT I CAUGHT YOU EVERY TIME.

389
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:14,418
YOUR FATHER LOVED YOU
VERY MUCH. YOU SHOULD
NEVER FORGET THAT.

390
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,304
I REMEMBER THE SUMMER
WHEN MY FATHER WAS

391
00:29:16,372 --> 00:29:21,759
SCOUTING AGAINST THE NAVAJOS
AND YOU ALL PUT ME UP?

392
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:27,782
YOUR FATHER WOULD
KISS YOU EVERY NIGHT.

393
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,119
I REMEMBER IT WHEN HE TRIED
TO KISS YOU GOODNIGHT.

394
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:34,505
YOU WERE WHAT?
MAYBE 9, 10?

395
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:39,794
YOU WENT CRAZY.

396
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:42,430
I GUESS YOU'LL BE
MOVING ON NOW.

397
00:29:42,498 --> 00:29:44,599
I'M NOT LEAVING.

398
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:47,051
I THOUGHT IT
MIGHT BE USEFUL--

399
00:29:46,903 --> 00:29:50,922
NO ONE'S MAKING ME MOVE.

400
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,942
MY FATHER
BUILT THIS PLACE.

401
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,211
I'LL HIRE SOMEONE
TO WORK IT IF I HAVE TO,

402
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:03,385
BUT I'M NOT LEAVING.

403
00:30:03,452 --> 00:30:07,088
MARY AND INEZ ARE
DEAD, AREN'T THEY?

404
00:30:07,156 --> 00:30:12,460
NO, I THINK THEY'RE
ALL RIGHT.

405
00:30:12,528 --> 00:30:18,599
WE'LL GET 'EM BACK.

406
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:29,644
DO YOU KNOW THE TEHATCHI BREAK
ON THE LITTLE COLORADO?

407
00:30:29,712 --> 00:30:31,045
SURE DO.

408
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:33,848
TELL THE NAVAJOS
TO MEET US THERE
WITH THE SUPPLIES.

409
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,584
I WANT YOU TO GO WITH 'EM.
BRING A SPARE MOUNT.

410
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:42,724
YES, SIR. YOU CAN
COUNT ON IT.

411
00:30:58,574 --> 00:31:04,312
( dramatic music )

412
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:56,297
THERE IT IS.

413
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:58,566
GOD.

414
00:31:58,634 --> 00:32:02,470
YOU PATROLLED ALL THIS
WITH CAUTION IN '64?

415
00:32:02,538 --> 00:32:05,172
NAVAJO CAMPAIGN.

416
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,609
FROM HERE, EAST TO NEW MEXICO
AND NORTH TO UTAH.

417
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:13,881
( Noble )
FIFTEEN THOUSAND SQUARE MILES.
HARD COUNTRY. BAD MEMORIES.

418
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:15,182
IF WE HEAD DUE EAST,

419
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:18,152
WE HAVE TO CUT THEIR TRAIL
SOONER OR LATER.

420
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,922
LIKE TRYING TO FIND
A WAVE IN THE OCEAN.

421
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:27,061
I'LL KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT.

422
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:36,270
THERE'S TRACKS
ALL THROUGH HERE.

423
00:32:36,338 --> 00:32:42,410
MUSTANGS. INDIAN PONIES.
NOT OUR PEOPLE.

424
00:32:55,290 --> 00:33:01,362
INEZ.

425
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,835
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

426
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:13,307
THEY'LL SEND SOMEBODY
TO FIND US, YOU'LL SEE.

427
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:16,611
HERE'S WHERE
THEY MOUNTED THIS MORNING.

428
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:21,082
THESE TWO ARE THE GIRLS.
SEE THE SMALL PRINTS?

429
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:25,753
HERE'S THE HORSE
THAT WAS LEADING THEM.

430
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:29,157
SEE WHERE THE RIDER MOUNTED?

431
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:32,227
( Noble )
MEDIUM STRIDE, HIGH HEELED,
THAT'D BE THE HORSE THIEF.

432
00:33:32,294 --> 00:33:34,395
MILLER.

433
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:37,198
THERE'S TWO MORE.

434
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:41,736
( Noble )
LONG STRIDE'S.
PROBABLY THE CAVALRYMAN.

435
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:47,775
THAT LEAVES STILWELL.

436
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:50,645
( Lane )
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

437
00:33:50,713 --> 00:33:54,348
SEE THE WAY HIS HORSE VEERS
TO THE RIGHT EVERY FOURTH STEP?

438
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:59,020
MEANS HE'S HOLDING THE REIGNS
IN HIS RIGHT HAND.

439
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:03,524
SON OF A BITCH IS LEFT-HANDED.

440
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:09,497
BETTER THAN SIX HOURS
AHEAD OF US. WE GOT SOME
HARD RIDING TO DO.

441
00:34:18,907 --> 00:34:20,274
GODDAMN IT!

442
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:22,110
WHY DON'T WE TAKE
THE LEE'S FERRY

443
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:24,311
INSTEAD OF CHASING
ALL OVER THE PLACE?

444
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:26,147
LOTS OF SUN, ISN'T THERE?

445
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:28,516
YOU COULD GO FASTER
IF YOU LET US GO.

446
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:32,086
WHO SAID YOU COULD TALK?
YOU AIN'T GOT NO RIGHT TO TALK.

447
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,855
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
LITTLE LADY?

448
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:39,994
YOU AIN'T TIRED
OF OUR COMPANY, ARE YOU?

449
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:53,107
PICKED UP A COUPLE
OF HOURS ON 'EM.

450
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,710
WE'LL CAMP HERE
AND REST THE HORSES.

451
00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:58,245
MIGHT TAKE A BATH, TOO,
AS LONG AS WE'RE HERE.

452
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:01,082
BATH SOUNDS GREAT.

453
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,685
I DIDN'T SAY YOU.

454
00:35:03,752 --> 00:35:08,189
FIRST ME AND LANE,
THEN THE HORSES, THEN YOU

455
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:14,328
IF THERE'S LIGHT LEFT.

456
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,980
THIS IS GREAT!

457
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,916
( Tom )
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE ME HERE

458
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:39,253
AND I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU LATER?

459
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:41,155
I SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LEAVE ME HERE

460
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:47,294
"AND I'LL CATCH UP WITH"

461
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,838
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

462
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:02,243
I WANT MY CLOTHES!

463
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:10,017
YES, THIS IS WHAT PASSES
FOR YOUR FRONTIER HUMOR?

464
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:14,922
YOU LOOK FOR THESE?

465
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,892
I FOUND SOMEBODY!

466
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,998
<i>HOMBRE ! WITH LITTLE  COJO!</i>

467
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:36,944
'EVENING.

468
00:36:37,012 --> 00:36:38,412
IS THAT HIM?

469
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,782
I DON'T KNOW. COULD BE.

470
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:44,184
WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING
RUNNING AROUND NAKED FOR?

471
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:46,988
I WAS TAKING A BATH.

472
00:36:47,055 --> 00:36:53,828
LOOKS LIKE
A LITTLE BLUE ACORN.

473
00:36:53,896 --> 00:36:55,429
CAN I HAVE MY CLOTHES?

474
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:57,765
I DOUBT IT.

475
00:36:57,833 --> 00:37:03,004
( Noble )
DO AS HE SAYS.

476
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:09,143
NOW.

477
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,875
WHO ARE YOU?

478
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:27,228
WE'RE UNITED
STATES MARSHALS.

479
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:29,730
WHO MIGHT YOU BE?

480
00:37:29,798 --> 00:37:35,903
CHUB DUMONT.
THESE HERE IS MY PARTNERS.

481
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:38,039
ARMY HORSES?

482
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:39,540
YEAH.

483
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:43,410
BOUGHT 'EM AT A GOVERNMENT
AUCTION IN FORT STOCKTON.

484
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:47,982
FORT STOCKTON, TEXAS?
LITTLE FAR AFIELD, AIN'T YA?

485
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:53,254
MATTER OF FACT, WE ARE.
LIKE TO KEEP ON THE MOVE.

486
00:37:53,322 --> 00:37:56,457
WE WAS IN WINSLOW
A COUPLE DAYS AGO

487
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:02,596
AND THIS HERE COME OUT.

488
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:08,302
BOUNTY HUNTERS.

489
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:13,640
PICKED UP YOUR TRAIL YESTERDAY.
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE STILWELL.

490
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,077
GUESS WE WAS WRONG.

491
00:38:16,144 --> 00:38:18,946
SO HAPPENS
WE'RE AFTER THE SAME PARTY.

492
00:38:19,014 --> 00:38:21,582
THAT A FACT?

493
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:29,323
WE AIM TO GET THAT MONEY,
MISTER, ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

494
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,342
WHY DON'T YOU STRING
ALONG WITH US?

495
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:35,529
BOUNTY'S NONE OF OUR CONCERN.

496
00:38:35,597 --> 00:38:37,765
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

497
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:41,735
THESE MEN LOOK HUNGRY,
WHY DON'T Y'ALL START DINNER?

498
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:47,875
COME DOWN THE RIVER WITH ME.

499
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,616
SCURVY LOOKING BUNCH.

00:38:55,683 --> 00:39:01,455
I'VE SEEN WORSE.

501
00:39:01,522 --> 00:39:03,824
WHAT ABOUT THOSE HORSES?

502
00:39:03,892 --> 00:39:07,494
I NEVER KNEW THE ARMY
TO SELL 8-YEAR-OLD HORSES.

503
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:13,634
IT DOESN'T.
THEY'RE DESERTERS.

504
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:29,349
I'LL HAVE SOME MORE
OF THAT COFFEE, ACORN.

505
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:32,386

WELL, THANKS, ACORN.

514
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:23,204

LOOK AT HIM.

516
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,142
SCRUBBING OUT THEM DISHES

00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:31,712
JUST LIKE
A FINE LITTLE WIFE.

518
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:33,780
YOU WANNA BE A SQUAW,
BOY,

519
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:36,550
JUST COME OVER HERE

00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:42,689
I AIN'T HAD A WOMAN IN A MONTH.
I'LL MAKE YOU SQUAW!

521
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:57,288
ALL RIGHT. GET UP.

522
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:17,024
LORD, IF IT AIN'T
JOHN L. SULLIVAN HIS OWN SELF.

523
00:41:17,092 --> 00:41:22,696
I GUESS I'M JUST GONNA
HAVE TO BEAT YOU LIKE A DOG.

524
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:21,155
SHIT, THAT'S RANK.

525
00:42:21,222 --> 00:42:26,726
LOST YOUR SUPPER
AND A FIGHT ALL AT ONCE.

526
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,362
WANT SOME MORE?

527
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:32,333
THAT'LL DO.

528
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,800
YOU SHOWED HIM.

529
00:42:33,868 --> 00:42:35,502
YOU STRAIGHTENED
THAT BOY OUT.

530
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:39,940
HE SURE DID!

531
00:42:40,008 --> 00:42:46,080
GET AWAY FROM THAT.

532
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:54,221
I SAID, "GET AWAY
FROM THAT PISTOL."

533
00:43:00,862 --> 00:43:02,863
GIVE ME A DRINK.

534
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:08,168
YOU HAD IT, BOY?
NEEDING A BIG 'UN?

535
00:43:08,236 --> 00:43:11,271
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO FIGHT LIKE THAT, SON?

536
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:16,076
PHILADELPHIA.
PROFESSOR MIKE DONOVAN.

537
00:43:16,144 --> 00:43:20,881
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
THAT WAS ARTISTIC!

538
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:22,749
YOU BEAT
THE SHIT OUT OF HIM!

539
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:25,285
I GUESS I DID, DIDN'T I?

540
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,137
WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT HIM?

541
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:28,855
SIR?

542
00:43:28,923 --> 00:43:30,957
HE WAS GONNA KILL YOU.

543
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:32,342
COME ON,
HE JUST GOT ANGRY.

544
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:35,695
HE WAS GONNA KILL YOU.

545
00:43:35,763 --> 00:43:38,832
YOU ONLY PULL THAT WEAPON
FOR ONE REASON.

546
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:41,201
IF YOU'RE GONNA CARRY ONE,
YOU BETTER BE READY TO USE IT.

547
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:46,240
YOU'RE NOT.
SO LET'S HAVE IT.

548
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:52,379
SIDE ARMS, SIR.

549
00:43:54,649 --> 00:44:00,720
WE'LL JUST KEEP THIS
ON THE PACKHORSE FROM NOW ON.

550
00:44:04,526 --> 00:44:09,229
YOU JUST HAD TO
TAKE HIM DOWN A PEG,
DIDN'T YOU?

551
00:44:09,297 --> 00:44:15,369
HE THINKS THIS
IS SOME KIND OF GAME.

552
00:44:22,777 --> 00:44:23,843
GOOD MORNING.

553
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,745
'MORNING.

554
00:44:25,813 --> 00:44:27,347
COFFEE'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE.

555
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:32,319
GOOD.

556
00:44:32,387 --> 00:44:36,123
THE BOUNTY HUNTERS.
WHERE'D THEY GO?

557
00:44:36,191 --> 00:44:37,558
'MORNING, TOM.

558
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:40,494
TOOK OFF A COUPLE HOURS AGO,
HEADED FOR BLACK FALLS.

559
00:44:40,562 --> 00:44:42,496
SHOULDN'T WE GET AFTER 'EM?

560
00:44:42,564 --> 00:44:45,566
STILWELL DIDN'T
HEAD FOR BLACK FALLS.

561
00:44:45,633 --> 00:44:48,068
I SHOWED 'EM
THE WRONG TRAIL.

562
00:44:48,136 --> 00:44:51,071
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE
PUTTING ONE OVER ON US.

563
00:44:51,139 --> 00:44:53,707
WHAT TRAIL
DID THEY FOLLOW?

564
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,543
REMEMBER THOSE
MUSTANG TRACKS?

565
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:03,717
THEY KEEP GOING
LIKE THEY'RE GOING,
THEY'LL END UP IN MEXICO.

566
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,585
I HATE THIS WIND!

567
00:45:05,654 --> 00:45:07,688
THIS AIN'T NOTHING.

568
00:45:07,756 --> 00:45:10,791
LOOK AT THAT!

569
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:14,194
( Jack )
I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOKS OF THAT!

570
00:45:14,262 --> 00:45:15,562
WE GOTTA TAKE COVER.

571
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,031
WHERE?

572
00:45:17,098 --> 00:45:23,270
I KNOW A PLACE.
FOSSIL HILL.

573
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:46,326
GODDAMN IT.

574
00:45:46,394 --> 00:45:50,564
( Lane )
IT'S A NORTHER.
COME EARLY THIS YEAR.

575
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:56,704
HAVE TO WAIT IT OUT.
COME ON.

576
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:09,482
FEELS LIKE ANTS
ARE EATIN' ME.

577
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,919
( Noble )
WON'T BE A TRACK
LEFT OUT THERE.

578
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:14,988
( Lane )
THEY GOT TO
GET TO SHELTER, TOO.

579
00:46:15,056 --> 00:46:18,792
THERE IS ONE PLACE THEY COULD
GO, BUT I DOUBT IF THEY
KNOW ABOUT IT.

580
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,194
NOT MANY WHITE MEN DO.

581
00:46:20,261 --> 00:46:22,529
MAYBE....

582
00:46:22,597 --> 00:46:23,330
WHAT?

583
00:46:23,397 --> 00:46:24,164
NOTHING.

584
00:46:24,232 --> 00:46:25,532
SPIT IT OUT.

585
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:31,671
I WAS JUST THINKING,
MAYBE THE NAVAJO GIRL
WOULD KNOW.

586
00:46:50,759 --> 00:46:57,397
MIND IF WE HOLE UP HERE
UNTIL THE WIND BLOWS OVER?

587
00:46:57,465 --> 00:47:03,670
COME ON!

588
00:47:10,011 --> 00:47:13,513
GOT SOMETHING TO DRINK
OVER THERE, CHIEF?

589
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:19,653
I THINK IT'S PARTY TIME.

590
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:31,231
THAT SMELLS
LIKE HORSE PISS!

591
00:47:31,299 --> 00:47:35,969
THAT'S TIZWAN.
THE OL' MAN MUST BE
PART APACHE.

592
00:47:36,037 --> 00:47:43,010
YOU WANT SOME OF THIS BREW?

593
00:47:43,077 --> 00:47:46,013
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS PLACE IS?

594
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,399
IT'S AN OLD-TIME
INDIAN CLIFF HOUSE.

595
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,368
NO,

596
00:47:51,436 --> 00:47:53,036
IT'S TESTIMONY.

597
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:55,222
IT'S WHAT?

598
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:58,758
TESTIMONY TO
THE BOOK OF MORMON.

599
00:47:58,827 --> 00:48:02,229
OH, BOY.
HERE WE GO.

600
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:05,398
THE BOOK
OF MORMON TEACHES

601
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:09,803
THAT WAY BACK IN BIBLE TIMES,
A LOST TRIBE OF ISRAEL
SETTLED HERE.

602
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:13,807
AFTER A WHILE,
THEY SPLIT INTO TWO BUNCHES.

603
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:16,743
THE NEPHITES,
WHO WERE BELOVED OF GOD

604
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,446
AND THE LAMANITES,
WHO WERE EVIL.

605
00:48:19,513 --> 00:48:21,114
THEY HAD THIS WAR,

606
00:48:21,182 --> 00:48:23,984
AND THE LAMANITES
KILLED OFF THE NEPHITES.

607
00:48:24,052 --> 00:48:25,986
GOD WAS SO ANGRY

608
00:48:26,054 --> 00:48:30,140
HE TURNED THEIR SKINS RED
AND MADE THEM DARK SAVAGES.

609
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:34,694
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE GOT
YOUR INDIANS TODAY!

610
00:48:34,762 --> 00:48:38,699
HE IS A LAMANITE!

611
00:48:38,766 --> 00:48:42,936
YOU SEE THIS? IT'S AN
OLD-TIME LAMANITE SKULL.

612
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,472
NAVAJO.

613
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:50,010
NO.

614
00:48:50,078 --> 00:48:52,645
YOU ARE A LAMANITE.

615
00:48:52,713 --> 00:48:55,182
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY ONE.

616
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,569
YOU CAN BECOME WHITE
AND DELIGHTSOME AGAIN
IN HIS SIGHT.

617
00:48:58,419 --> 00:49:00,920
THAT'S BULLSHIT
AND YOU KNOW IT.

618
00:49:00,722 --> 00:49:03,257
NO, IT'S THE GOSPEL,
I'M TELLING YOU!

619
00:49:03,324 --> 00:49:07,327
UP AROUND CEDAR CITY WE GOT UTES
JUST AS DARK AND UGLY AS HELL.

620
00:49:07,228 --> 00:49:09,029
BUT WHEN WE BAPTIZE THEM

621
00:49:09,097 --> 00:49:15,869
YOU CAN SEE 'EM BECOMING PALE
AND WHITE AND DELIGHTSOME AGAIN.

622
00:49:15,937 --> 00:49:21,975
I'D SAY SHE LOOKS DELIGHTSOME
JUST THE WAY SHE IS.

623
00:49:35,456 --> 00:49:41,361
HERE, HOLD THIS!

624
00:49:41,429 --> 00:49:47,534
COME HERE, LITTLE LADY!

625
00:49:52,206 --> 00:49:57,144
ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

626
00:49:57,211 --> 00:49:58,511
DO YOU LIKE ME?

627
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:02,382
I GUESS SO.

628
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:08,788
YOU KNOW, IF I HAD A DAUGHTER,
I'D WANT HER TO BE
JUST LIKE YOU.

629
00:50:08,856 --> 00:50:10,590
'CAUSE I THINK YOU'RE
A PRINCESS.

630
00:50:10,658 --> 00:50:13,293
THANK YOU.

631
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:14,527
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

632
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,012
TWELVE AND A HALF.

633
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:22,302
CAN YOU REMEMBER THINGS
FROM WHEN YOU WERE REAL LITTLE?

634
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:25,805
DID YOU KNOW
I WAS AN ORPHAN?

635
00:50:25,873 --> 00:50:29,009
A NICE MORMON FAMILY
TOOK ME IN TO RAISE.

636
00:50:29,077 --> 00:50:35,315
JUST LIKE THEIR OWN,
OUTSIDE CEDAR CITY.

637
00:50:35,383 --> 00:50:37,450
YOU EVER BEEN TO UTAH?

638
00:50:37,518 --> 00:50:38,718
NO.

639
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:42,289
YOU'LL LIKE IT.

640
00:50:42,523 --> 00:50:44,691
I GOT A HOUSE THERE

641
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:48,261
AND WE COULD FIX IT UP
AND LIVE IN IT.

642
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:49,546
NO!

643
00:50:49,614 --> 00:50:53,166
AND AFTER A WHILE

644
00:50:53,234 --> 00:50:56,986
SAY, ABOUT THREE YEARS....

645
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,006
I WANT TO GO HOME NOW!

646
00:51:00,074 --> 00:51:02,775
PRINCESS.

647
00:51:02,843 --> 00:51:06,246
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CRY,
EVER, PRINCESS.

648
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:09,582
I WON'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO YOU, EVER.

649
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,251
I PROMISE.

650
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:17,391
NOW, LOOK, I'M GONNA
DO SOMETHING NICE FOR YOU.

651
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:31,638
YOU'LL LIKE IT IN UTAH.

652
00:51:31,705 --> 00:51:34,508
WE'LL HAVE LOTS OF FUN.

653
00:51:34,575 --> 00:51:35,775
YOU'LL SEE.

654
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:39,746
HECK, WE GONNA GET THE CHIEF
TO COME AND BE OUR DADDY.

655
00:51:39,813 --> 00:51:43,016
HOW 'BOUT THAT, CHIEF?
YOU WANNA BE OUR DAD?

656
00:51:43,084 --> 00:51:44,651
NO.

657
00:51:44,718 --> 00:51:48,922
WHY THE HELL NOT? YOU WANNA
STAY HERE AND DIE
ALL BY YOURSELF?

658
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:50,557
NOT AFRAID.

659
00:51:50,624 --> 00:51:53,426
( Chief )
I DIE, I GO

660
00:51:53,494 --> 00:51:59,232
BECOME LEGEND.

661
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:08,408
A LEGEND.

662
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:28,828
( dramatic music )

663
00:52:46,447 --> 00:52:50,350
THEY WERE HERE ALL RIGHT.
OLD MAN SAID
THEY PULLED OUT YESTERDAY.

664
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:54,287
WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS?
ARE THEY ALL RIGHT?

665
00:52:54,355 --> 00:52:58,558
HE SAID THEY HAD THEIR WAY
WITH THE NAVAJO GIRL.

666
00:52:58,626 --> 00:53:00,427
GODDAMN IT.

667
00:53:00,495 --> 00:53:06,566
SOONER THEY HANG, THE BETTER.
COME ON,
WE'RE BURNING DAYLIGHT.

668
00:53:23,651 --> 00:53:26,620
WHAT IS IT?

669
00:53:26,687 --> 00:53:32,759
WHY WOULD THEY
LEAVE A TRAIL SO CLEAR?

670
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:50,877
SON OF A BITCH.

671
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:52,312
KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

672
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,247
LOOKS LIKE A HORSE APPLE.

673
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:58,017
DAY OLD. SEE WHAT
HE'S BEEN EATING?

674
00:53:58,085 --> 00:54:01,688
THAT'S GRAMA.
THERE'S NO GRAMA AROUND HERE.

675
00:54:01,756 --> 00:54:03,657
( Noble )
GROWS 10 MILES UP THE WASH.

676
00:54:03,724 --> 00:54:07,543
THE FALSE TRAIL.
THEY'VE BACKTRACKED.

677
00:54:07,695 --> 00:54:10,197
THEY'RE BEHIND US.

678
00:54:10,264 --> 00:54:13,233
IN TWO DAYS,
THEY'LL BE AT LEE'S FERRY.

679
00:54:13,301 --> 00:54:17,020
ONCE ACROSS THE RIVER,
THEY'RE THREE HOURS
FROM UTAH AND HOME FREE.

680
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,471
THEN, LETS GET AFTER 'EM.

681
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:21,308
NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

682
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:23,243
MAYBE WE CAN BEAT 'EM TO IT.

683
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:26,779
IF WE CUT ACROSS HERE, WE CAN BE
AT LEE'S FERRY AHEAD OF 'EM.

684
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,548
THERE'S A MOUNTAIN IN THE WAY!

685
00:54:28,616 --> 00:54:34,688
RIGHT.

686
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,316
COME ON.

687
00:55:36,384 --> 00:55:42,455
WE'LL HAVE
TO PULL IT TO THE TOP.

688
00:55:47,695 --> 00:55:53,800
WATCH YOURSELF.
WATCH OUT.

689
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,966
NICE VIEW.

690
00:56:27,034 --> 00:56:33,105
DON'T JUST STAND HERE
AND ADMIRE IT. LET'S GET GOIN'.

691
00:56:48,922 --> 00:56:54,661
I'LL GET SOME MORE WOOD.

692
00:56:54,729 --> 00:56:57,196
BOY'S ALL RIGHT.

693
00:56:57,264 --> 00:57:00,032
GOT A LOT OF BARK ON HIM.

694
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,669
YOU SEE HOW HE GOT DOWN
UNDER THAT HORSE TODAY?

695
00:57:02,737 --> 00:57:07,407
SCARED ME TO DEATH.

696
00:57:07,475 --> 00:57:13,546
STILL CAN'T FIGURE WHY HE WANTS
TO LIVE IN PHILADELPHIA.

697
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:23,923
DO YOU EVER NOTICE THE WAY
HE LOOKS AT ME SOMETIMES?

698
00:57:23,991 --> 00:57:27,660
HIS MOTHER USED TO LOOK AT ME
THAT WAY WHEN
WE LIVED BACK EAST.

699
00:57:27,728 --> 00:57:31,264
SHE WASN'T ASHAMED OF ME, BUT

700
00:57:31,331 --> 00:57:35,769
I DIDN'T HAVE THE EDUCATION
OF HER FRIENDS.

701
00:57:35,836 --> 00:57:39,806
I THINK SOMETIMES SHE FELT
BAD FOR ME IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.

702
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:46,646
I THINK THAT'S WHY
SHE HAD ME BRING HER OUT HERE.

703
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:51,718
THAT'S WHY I SENT TOM
BACK EAST TO COLLEGE

704
00:57:51,786 --> 00:57:57,857
SO NO ONE WOULD EVER
LOOK AT HIM THAT WAY.

705
00:58:14,442 --> 00:58:18,912
( Noble )
THERE THEY ARE.

706
00:58:18,979 --> 00:58:21,147
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

707
00:58:21,214 --> 00:58:27,286
THEY'D SEE US COMING.
WE'LL TAKE 'EM TOMORROW
AT LEE'S FERRY.

708
00:58:35,629 --> 00:58:38,264
WISH WE HAD A FIRE.

709
00:58:38,332 --> 00:58:46,372
NOT TONIGHT.
THEY'RE TOO CLOSE.

710
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,509
LOOK AT THAT SKY.

711
00:58:49,577 --> 00:58:52,612
YOU CAN SEE EVERY STAR
GOD CREATED.

712
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,915
( Noble )
YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF 'EM.

713
00:58:55,983 --> 00:59:00,186
KIND OF MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU BELONG TO SOMETHING BIGGER.

714
00:59:00,253 --> 00:59:03,790
I GUESS IT DOES.

715
00:59:03,858 --> 00:59:10,296
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
YOU STAY OUT HERE.

716
00:59:10,364 --> 00:59:16,435
I GUESS THAT IS WHY.

717
00:59:18,672 --> 00:59:22,308
GOODNIGHT, SIR.

718
00:59:22,376 --> 00:59:28,447
GOODNIGHT, PARTNER.

719
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:09,138
GOOD ENOUGH. TOM AND I'LL CROSS
THE RIVER AND SET UP
ON THE BANK.

720
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:12,558
ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE ON
THIS SIDE IN THE TREES.

721
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:15,828
WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THE RIVER,
I'LL HOLLER AT 'EM
TO SURRENDER.

722
01:00:15,896 --> 01:00:17,630
IN THAT CURRENT,
WE'LL HAVE 'EM.

723
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,098
ALL RIGHT.

724
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:22,568
BUT IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,
DON'T STOP TO ARGUE ABOUT IT.

725
01:00:22,636 --> 01:00:28,707
SHOOT TO KILL.

726
01:00:41,922 --> 01:00:47,793
I'VE BEEN MEANIN' TO ASK YOU
WHY YOU STILL USE
THAT SINGLE SHOT?

727
01:00:47,861 --> 01:00:50,663
HITS HARDER.

728
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,667
WHAT IF YOU MISS?

729
01:00:54,734 --> 01:01:00,806
I DON'T PLAN TO.

730
01:01:28,402 --> 01:01:34,474
( suspenseful music )

731
01:01:41,248 --> 01:01:47,320
( whistles )

732
01:02:07,274 --> 01:02:13,312
WHAT IS IT?

733
01:02:15,715 --> 01:02:19,152
( gunshots )

734
01:02:19,219 --> 01:02:25,291
GODDAMN
BOUNTY HUNTERS!

735
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:55,421
GET OUT OF HERE!

736
01:02:57,157 --> 01:02:59,892
( Lane )
STILWELL!

737
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:06,031
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

738
01:03:28,522 --> 01:03:33,343
GODDAMN IT, WE LOST 'EM.

739
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:39,231
COME ON BACK.

740
01:03:57,817 --> 01:04:03,889
LANE!

741
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:22,275
GET THE BANDAGES
OUT OF THE PACKHORSE. QUICK!

742
01:04:22,342 --> 01:04:25,177
EASY, PARTNER.
LIE STILL.

743
01:04:25,245 --> 01:04:31,484
STILWELL SHOT ME.
TOOK THE HORSE.

744
01:04:31,551 --> 01:04:33,552
EASY.

745
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,788
WHAT'D HE SAY?

746
01:04:35,855 --> 01:04:40,676
HE SAYS STILWELL SHOT HIM
AND TOOK HIS HORSE.

747
01:04:40,744 --> 01:04:43,529
EASY!

748
01:04:43,597 --> 01:04:45,998
HE TOOK

749
01:04:46,065 --> 01:04:52,137
MY BADGE.

750
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,244
HOW'S YOUR MAN?

751
01:05:15,312 --> 01:05:17,162
HE'S DEAD.

752
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:19,332
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

753
01:05:19,399 --> 01:05:21,900
OL' BOB SAID HE PICKED UP
YOUR TRAIL IN THE WOODS.

754
01:05:21,968 --> 01:05:25,037
LOOKED LIKE THEY'S
HEADED SOUTH.

755
01:05:25,104 --> 01:05:31,344
JUST TOUCH THOSE GUNS.

756
01:05:38,918 --> 01:05:44,990
GET UP.

757
01:05:47,494 --> 01:05:53,599
YOU MEN CAN RIDE OUT OF HERE
OR YOU CAN DIE.

758
01:05:53,667 --> 01:05:58,404
THERE'S NO THIRD WAY.

759
01:05:58,472 --> 01:06:05,745
LEAVE THAT TRASH
WHERE IT LAYS.

760
01:06:05,812 --> 01:06:09,181
ONE MORE THING.

761
01:06:09,249 --> 01:06:12,852
IF I EVER SEE
ANY OF YOU AGAIN

762
01:06:12,919 --> 01:06:18,991
EXPECT NO QUARTER.

763
01:06:55,796 --> 01:06:59,998
( horse approaching )

764
01:07:00,066 --> 01:07:03,001
HE'S COMING.

765
01:07:03,069 --> 01:07:05,971
WE ABOUT GAVE UP ON YOU.

766
01:07:06,039 --> 01:07:07,539
WHERE'D YOU GET THE HORSE?

767
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:10,075
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS.

768
01:07:10,143 --> 01:07:14,480
BOYS, I GOT ME NOBLE ADAMS.

769
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:18,083
HE JUST COME OUT OF NOWHERE.
BUT I WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM.

770
01:07:18,151 --> 01:07:21,654
I FILLED HIM SO FULL OF HOLES,
HE WOULDN'T FLOAT IN BRINE.

771
01:07:21,721 --> 01:07:22,855
WOULDN'T FLOAT!

772
01:07:22,923 --> 01:07:25,290
LOOK, THERE'S HIS BADGE.

773
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:26,892
BUT LOOK AT THIS.

774
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,562
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

775
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:33,231
SAYS THERE'S
A $500 REWARD FOR US.

776
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,967
THAT'S YOUR NAME RIGHT THERE.

777
01:07:35,034 --> 01:07:36,034
$500?

778
01:07:36,102 --> 01:07:38,804
LOOK AT THAT,
THAT'S $125 APIECE.

779
01:07:38,872 --> 01:07:43,676
THAT'S A
PRETTY PIECE OF MONEY!

780
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:49,815
DEAD OR ALIVE.

781
01:07:53,553 --> 01:07:54,854
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

782
01:07:54,921 --> 01:07:57,656
BOUNTY HUNTERS.

783
01:07:57,724 --> 01:08:00,292
THEY'LL CAMP IN THOSE TREES.

784
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,362
PROBABLY PAY US
A VISIT BEFORE MORNIN'.

785
01:08:03,429 --> 01:08:09,001
I CAN'T ALLOW THAT.

786
01:08:09,068 --> 01:08:15,641
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

787
01:08:15,709 --> 01:08:23,182
WE'RE GONNA KILL 'EM.

788
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,783
JUST LIKE THAT?

789
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:30,723
THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE.

790
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:33,326
AIN'T NO NEED
TO BOTHER WITH THAT.

791
01:08:33,393 --> 01:08:39,465
WE AIN'T
GONNA BE HERE THAT LONG.

792
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:55,748
I'LL CROSS HERE. YOU GO
UPSTREAM,
AND GET THE OTHER SIDE OF 'EM.

793
01:08:55,815 --> 01:08:58,584
WE'LL GET 'EM IN A CROSSFIRE.

794
01:08:58,652 --> 01:08:59,518
ALL RIGHT?

795
01:08:59,586 --> 01:09:02,788
YEAH.

796
01:09:02,856 --> 01:09:06,559
WAIT FOR MY FIRST SHOT.

797
01:09:06,627 --> 01:09:11,063
AIM LOW,
DON'T SHOOT TOO FAST.

798
01:09:11,131 --> 01:09:12,981
HAMMER DOWN
ON AN EMPTY CHAMBER?

799
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:14,367
YEAH.

800
01:09:14,434 --> 01:09:22,174
LOAD IT.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED ALL SIX.

801
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:24,710
HOW'S THAT FACE, CHUB?

802
01:09:24,778 --> 01:09:26,679
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

803
01:09:26,747 --> 01:09:33,118
I'M GONNA SNATCH THAT BASTARD'S
PRIVATES OUT, YOU CAN BET ON IT.

804
01:09:33,186 --> 01:09:37,089
FILL UP THEM CANTEENS
BEFORE WE MOVE OUT.

805
01:09:37,157 --> 01:09:43,228
SNATCH OUT HIS PRIVATES!

806
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:05,184
( man )
OVER HERE.

807
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:23,402
COME ON, ACORN!

808
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:26,638
COME ON, ACORN!

809
01:10:26,706 --> 01:10:30,343
KILL ME!

810
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:36,749
PUT ANOTHER ONE IN HIM.

811
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:42,888
KILL HIM!

812
01:13:12,071 --> 01:13:14,439
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

813
01:13:14,508 --> 01:13:20,579
WHY DON'T YOU SIT THERE?

814
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:25,083
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

815
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:26,986
IT HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY.

816
01:13:27,053 --> 01:13:28,554
I LOST MY NERVE.

817
01:13:28,622 --> 01:13:33,726
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

818
01:13:33,793 --> 01:13:37,295
I JUST COULDN'T KILL HIM.

819
01:13:37,363 --> 01:13:40,599
IF YOU HAD KILLED HIM

820
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:45,504
YOU'D FEEL
A HELL OF A LOT WORSE,
BELIEVE ME.

821
01:13:45,572 --> 01:13:50,242
YOU JUST REST THERE.
I'M GONNA CUT LOOSE THE HORSES.

822
01:13:50,309 --> 01:13:54,513
WHAT ABOUT THE BODIES?

823
01:13:54,581 --> 01:14:01,820
TO HELL WITH THEM.
WE'VE WASTED ENOUGH TIME
AS IT IS.

824
01:14:01,888 --> 01:14:04,939
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO NORTHEAST THIS TIME

825
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:08,561
( Brewer )
THROUGH MARSH PASS?

826
01:14:08,628 --> 01:14:14,700
I SAID, WHAT ABOUT GOING
THROUGH MARSH PASS?

827
01:14:17,938 --> 01:14:24,009
I HATE THIS WIND.

828
01:14:26,646 --> 01:14:29,247
WE SHOULD CATCH UP
WITH 'EM BY MORNIN'.

829
01:14:29,315 --> 01:14:31,617
I HOPE THOSE INDIANS
MAKE LITTLE COLORADO.

830
01:14:31,685 --> 01:14:35,153
WE ONLY GOT
ONE DAY'S SUPPLY LEFT.

831
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:41,293
PLACE LOOKS KIND OF FAMILIAR.

832
01:14:45,098 --> 01:14:51,937
FORT CAMMY'S 120 MILES THAT WAY.
YOU WERE BORN THERE.

833
01:14:52,005 --> 01:14:56,942
WHEN YOU WERE 2 YEARS OLD,
I DECIDED TO LEAVE THE ARMY.

834
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:58,944
LOADED YOU AND YOUR MOTHER
IN A WAGON,

835
01:14:59,012 --> 01:15:01,714
WE SET OUT FOR FLAGSTAFF.

836
01:15:01,781 --> 01:15:06,485
WE'D STOP FOR THE NIGHT
RIGHT DOWN IN THAT BASIN.

837
01:15:06,552 --> 01:15:12,491
YOUR MOTHER HAD JUST HANDED
YOU DOWN TO ME.

838
01:15:12,558 --> 01:15:16,361
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
MADE THE HORSES JUMP.

839
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:20,032
THE WAGON ROLLED,
AND SHE FELL UNDER THE WHEEL.

840
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,868
HER RIBS WERE ALL STOVED IN.

841
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:27,740
WE WERE MILES AWAY
FROM ANY HELP.

842
01:15:27,807 --> 01:15:32,945
I TRIED TO MOVE HER,
BUT EVERY TIME SHE'D SCREAM.

843
01:15:33,013 --> 01:15:38,817
SHE STARTED SPITTING BLOOD.

844
01:15:38,885 --> 01:15:43,421
THE HURT COME IN WAVES
AND YOU'D START CRYING.

845
01:15:43,489 --> 01:15:46,158
SHE'D SWALLOW THE PAIN
AND HOLD YOU IN HER ARMS

846
01:15:46,225 --> 01:15:51,196
TILL YOU QUIETED DOWN.

847
01:15:51,264 --> 01:15:55,868
MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST MORNING
AND SHE STARTED TO GO.

848
01:15:55,935 --> 01:15:58,637
I TOLD HER,
"YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

849
01:15:58,705 --> 01:16:03,408
"YOUR SON LOVES YOU TOO MUCH
TO LET YOU DIE."

850
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:07,846
SHE SMILED AT THAT.

851
01:16:07,914 --> 01:16:13,986
THEN, SHE WAS GONE.

852
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:22,494
SHE'S BURIED RIGHT OUT THERE
SOMEWHERE.

853
01:17:17,449 --> 01:17:19,617
( Jack )
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

854
01:17:19,685 --> 01:17:24,389
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

855
01:17:24,456 --> 01:17:28,793
MARY, GO!

856
01:17:28,928 --> 01:17:35,000
WHAT HAPPENED, JACK?

857
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:40,505
TAKE THE PRINCESS AWAY.

858
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:46,644
SURE, JACK.

859
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:59,291
SHE CUT ME.

860
01:18:26,953 --> 01:18:33,024
UNLOAD THE PACKHORSE.
BRING ME A BLANKET.

861
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:42,533
( speaking Navajo )

862
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:34,452
( Noble )
THE REST OF THEM ARE
AT THE LITTLE COLORADO

863
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,938
WITH OUR SUPPLIES.

864
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:42,860
HE'S GONNA BE BACK IN A
COUPLE OF HOURS
WITH HIS BROTHERS.

865
01:19:42,928 --> 01:19:45,796
I'VE GOTTA TAKE
A LONG CHANCE.

866
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:48,433
I GOTTA KNOW IF I
CAN COUNT ON YOU.

867
01:19:48,501 --> 01:19:53,104
IF I CAN'T, SAY SO,
BUT I GOTTA KNOW.

868
01:19:53,172 --> 01:19:59,244
YOU CAN.

869
01:20:08,154 --> 01:20:11,389
INEZ. I WANT TO KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

870
01:20:11,457 --> 01:20:15,427
I TOLD YOU, PRINCESS,
I LET HER GO.

871
01:20:15,494 --> 01:20:17,495
CAN'T YOU LET ME GO?

872
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:24,569
SOMEBODY'S COMING.

873
01:20:24,637 --> 01:20:27,439
ONE RIDER. HE'S GOT A RIFLE.

874
01:20:27,506 --> 01:20:29,407
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

875
01:20:29,475 --> 01:20:33,244
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT'S JUST ONE MAN.

876
01:20:33,312 --> 01:20:37,732
I AIN'T RUNNING FROM ONE MAN.
GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN.

877
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,286
ME NEITHER.
I'M SICK OF RUNNING.

878
01:20:41,353 --> 01:20:44,355
YOU BOYS DO
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

879
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:46,157
WHAT ABOUT YOU, KID?

880
01:20:46,225 --> 01:20:48,076
YOU GONNA BE A RABBIT
ALL YOUR LIFE?

881
01:20:48,144 --> 01:20:50,061
I AIN'T A RABBIT.

882
01:20:50,129 --> 01:20:51,446
THEN LET'S GET HIM.

883
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:57,635
( dramatic music )

884
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:08,506
HALT!
UNITED STATES MARSHAL!

885
01:22:08,574 --> 01:22:11,242
GET AWAY FROM HIM, MARY.

886
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:13,478
I CAN'T!

887
01:22:13,546 --> 01:22:14,963
STOP.

888
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,814
I'LL SHOOT!

889
01:22:16,882 --> 01:22:22,837
I'M JUST TURNING HER LOOSE.

890
01:22:22,905 --> 01:22:28,726
NO!

891
01:22:33,983 --> 01:22:39,720
DAMN.

892
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:50,598
CINCH THAT UP.

893
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:52,567
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR LEG?

894
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:57,838
I THINK IT'S BROKE.

895
01:22:57,906 --> 01:23:00,141
SURE IS.

896
01:23:00,209 --> 01:23:06,281
TWO PLACES.

897
01:23:07,783 --> 01:23:09,384
WHAT HAPPENED?

898
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:14,955
I DON'T KNOW.
I HAD HIM, BUT HE GOT AWAY.

899
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:16,924
I CAN SEE THAT.
WHAT HAPPENED?

900
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,927
I HAD HIM IN SIGHT
BUT I COULDN'T SHOOT HIM.

901
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,813
YOU HAD HIM IN YOUR SIGHTS?

902
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:24,932
HE HAD THE GIRL
IN FRONT OF HIM.

903
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:30,405
I DIDN'T WANNA HIT HER.

904
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:34,141
( Noble )
GET OVER THERE.

905
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:35,410
GET UP, BOY.

906
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:36,711
I CAN'T.

907
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:42,850
STAND UP!

908
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:50,925
EITHER OF YOU KNOW
WHICH WAY THEY'RE HEADED?

909
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:57,064
SEARCH ME.

910
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:05,139
I MEAN TO HAVE THAT GIRL SAFE.
I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN.

911
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:11,679
WHERE'S STILWELL HEADED?

912
01:24:11,747 --> 01:24:16,016
GUESS.

913
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:17,485
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

914
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:21,122
ALL RIGHT,
SAME QUESTION.

915
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:23,824
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA
TAKE THE GIRL HOME.

916
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:28,028
WHICH WAY?

917
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:29,530
MARSH PASS, I THINK.

918
01:24:29,598 --> 01:24:32,400
THAT'S 80 MILES.
WHERE'S HE GONNA GET WATER?

919
01:24:32,468 --> 01:24:38,539
I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S
ALL HE SAID, I SWEAR.

920
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:51,152
SORRY, SON,
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
A HORSE FOR YOU.

921
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:54,155
PLEASE, YOU CAN'T
LEAVE ME OUT HERE.

922
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:58,926
THERE'S PEOPLE
IN LITTLE COLORADO,
15 MILES THAT WAY.

923
01:24:58,994 --> 01:25:01,296
I CAN'T WALK ON THIS LEG.

924
01:25:01,363 --> 01:25:04,999
GUESS YOU'RE OUT
OF LUCK, THEN.

925
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:07,568
HERE, TAKE THIS.

926
01:25:07,636 --> 01:25:11,906
WE'LL BE NEEDING THAT.

927
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:16,076
GET ON THAT HORSE,
DAMN YOU.

928
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:22,216
PLEASE, MISTER!
I'LL DIE OUT HERE.

929
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:51,896
HELLO. I HAVE SOME
BAD NEWS FOR YOU.

930
01:25:51,964 --> 01:25:58,103
I KNOW. TONIO BROUGHT
HER BACK THIS MORNING.

931
01:25:58,170 --> 01:26:00,905
WHAT ABOUT MY SISTER?

932
01:26:00,973 --> 01:26:04,909
I'LL DO EVERYTHING IN MY
POWER TO GET HER BACK.

933
01:26:04,977 --> 01:26:09,214
I RODE OUT WITH LON AND HIS
FATHER. THEY'RE UPSTREAM
CATCHING SUPPER.

934
01:26:09,148 --> 01:26:10,681
I HOPE YOU CAN STAY.

935
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:14,885
I CAME FOR A FRESH HORSE.

936
01:26:14,787 --> 01:26:15,987
CAN I FILL THIS FOR YOU?

937
01:26:16,054 --> 01:26:22,127
IF YOU WOULD.

938
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:36,157
( Noble )
I WOULDN'T BOTHER WITH THAT.

939
01:26:36,142 --> 01:26:39,277
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE REST
OF THE HORSES TO THE RAILHEAD.

940
01:26:39,345 --> 01:26:42,680
I'LL MEET YOU THERE
WHEN I'M DONE.

941
01:26:42,748 --> 01:26:44,449
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

942
01:26:44,683 --> 01:26:46,901
I THINK IT'D BE BETTER
IF YOU DIDN'T.

943
01:26:46,968 --> 01:26:50,988
WHY?

944
01:26:51,056 --> 01:26:53,174
WHY IN THE HELL NOT?

945
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:59,397
IS IT EASIER TO KILL 'EM
IF I'M NOT WATCHING YOU?

946
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:21,553
THANK YOU.

947
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:43,974
I KNOW WHERE HE IS.

948
01:27:44,042 --> 01:27:46,110
HOME SWEET HOME.

949
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:53,117
AN INDIAN CLIFF DWELLING.
WE WERE THERE.

950
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:54,219
BE CAREFUL.

951
01:27:54,286 --> 01:27:56,621
I WILL.

952
01:27:56,689 --> 01:28:02,760
I'LL BRING HER BACK.

953
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:14,071
HELLO, THE HOUSE!

954
01:28:14,139 --> 01:28:17,975
HI, CHIEF. WE'RE HOME.

955
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:20,345
I SAID, "WE'RE HOME."

956
01:28:20,412 --> 01:28:26,818
LET'S GO, PRINCESS.

957
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:35,627
( dramatic music )

958
01:29:29,648 --> 01:29:31,749
YOU SICK YOUR DOG ON ME?

959
01:29:31,817 --> 01:29:33,217
LEAVE HIM ALONE!

960
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,687
YOU LIKE THAT INDIAN
BETTER THAN YOU LIKE ME?

961
01:29:35,754 --> 01:29:41,826
ANSWER ME,
YOU DIRTY LITTLE WHORE!

962
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,051
GOODBYE, TRASH.

963
01:29:49,868 --> 01:29:52,269
DON'T I GET A TRIAL?

964
01:29:52,338 --> 01:29:56,423
YOUR HANDS ON A CHILD,
ALL YOU GET IS DEAD.

965
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:58,575
NO!

966
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:04,081
( Mary )
PLEASE, MISTER.

967
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:10,254
DROP IT.

968
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:13,825
GET UP.

969
01:30:13,892 --> 01:30:19,964
PUT YOUR HANDS UP.

970
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:34,779
NOBLE ADAMS.

971
01:30:34,847 --> 01:30:40,501
RIGHT.

972
01:30:40,569 --> 01:30:44,789
MISTER,
TAKE ME HOME NOW, PLEASE.

973
01:30:44,857 --> 01:30:50,928
I WANT TO SEE MY DADDY.

974
01:30:53,899 --> 01:30:56,967
PLEASE GET UP, MISTER!

975
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:57,935
RUN!

976
01:30:58,003 --> 01:31:04,074
YOU COME BACK OVER HERE
AND STAY HERE!

977
01:31:23,429 --> 01:31:29,500
GOTCHA GOOD, DIDN'T I?

978
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,642
NOW, YOU DON'T MIND

979
01:31:37,709 --> 01:31:43,247
IF I TAKE THE PRINCESS
FOR A RIDE, DO YOU?

980
01:31:43,365 --> 01:31:45,282
( Jack )
I SAID

981
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:51,989
YOU DON'T MIND IF ME AND THE
PRINCESS GO FOR A RIDE, DO YOU?

982
01:31:52,057 --> 01:31:56,026
GO TO HELL.

983
01:31:56,094 --> 01:32:02,216
NOT ME, MR. NOBLE.

984
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:12,593
NOT ME.

985
01:32:33,365 --> 01:32:36,200
BACK SHOT ME.

986
01:32:36,268 --> 01:32:39,436
MY GOD.

987
01:32:39,504 --> 01:32:42,339
BLOOD'S DARK.

988
01:32:42,407 --> 01:32:45,409
THE BULLET'S IN MY LIVER.

989
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:50,682
I'LL BE DEAD IN AN HOUR.

990
01:32:50,749 --> 01:32:56,821
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT, SIR.

991
01:33:00,358 --> 01:33:06,430
GET HIM.

992
01:33:08,433 --> 01:33:14,505
I'LL BE BACK.

993
01:34:37,689 --> 01:34:43,661
STAY THERE
TILL I COME FOR YOU.

994
01:35:15,427 --> 01:35:21,631
GO ON.

995
01:35:38,050 --> 01:35:44,121
I KNOW WHEN I'M LICKED.

996
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:51,929
YOU GONNA HANG ME?

997
01:35:51,997 --> 01:35:55,199
NO.

998
01:35:55,267 --> 01:35:58,169
THEN THEY'LL SEND ME
BACK TO YUMA.

999
01:35:58,237 --> 01:35:59,720
NO, THEY WON'T.

1000
01:35:59,872 --> 01:36:03,241
THEY WON'T?

1001
01:36:03,308 --> 01:36:07,011
'CAUSE I'M SENDING
YOU TO HELL.

1002
01:36:07,079 --> 01:36:13,316
AND LET'S JUST SEE WHAT'S
IN THAT LEFT HAND OF YOURS.

1003
01:36:42,914 --> 01:36:49,053
HE GOT HIM.

1004
01:37:43,442 --> 01:37:45,809
HE DIE.

1005
01:37:45,877 --> 01:37:47,577
HE GO

1006
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:53,550
BECOME LEGEND.

1007
01:38:03,228 --> 01:38:06,630
WAIT A MINUTE. HOLD ON.
PUT HIM SOMEWHERE ELSE.

1008
01:38:06,698 --> 01:38:07,564
( man )
IT'S GONNA COST YOU.

1009
01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:08,849
( Tom )
I DON'T CARE.

1010
01:38:08,917 --> 01:38:14,771
I WON'T HAVE HIM IN THERE
WITH MY FATHER.

1011
01:38:27,352 --> 01:38:33,524
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO?

1012
01:38:33,591 --> 01:38:35,659
FIRST THING IS
TO GET HIM BACK HOME.

1013
01:38:35,727 --> 01:38:39,397
TRY TO EXPLAIN TO MY STEPMOTHER
HOW I GOT HER MAN KILLED.

1014
01:38:39,464 --> 01:38:42,299
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

1015
01:38:42,367 --> 01:38:44,801
WASN'T IT?

1016
01:38:44,869 --> 01:38:47,804
( Mary )
TOM!

1017
01:38:47,872 --> 01:38:50,141
<i>I GOT YOU A NEWSPAPER.
THE  DENVER TIMES .</i>

1018
01:38:50,208 --> 01:38:52,109
ONLY A WEEK OLD.

1019
01:38:52,177 --> 01:38:54,978
THANK YOU.

1020
01:38:55,047 --> 01:39:00,418

THANK YOU, TOM.

1023
