1
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:32,571
It's the law, Pecos!

2
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:37,881
We want you for the robbery of
the Katy Flyer, murder of the engineer.

3
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:41,651
- Get your hands on top of your heads...
- [Fires Gun]

4
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:47,356
[Firing Gun] You bastard!
You bastards!

5
00:02:49,432 --> 00:02:51,525
[Groans]

6
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:28,529
Rooster J. Cogburn,
please step forward.

7
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:35,038
Are you Deputy Marshal
for the U.S. District Court...

8
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:37,045
for the western district
of Arkansas,

9
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:39,206
having criminal jurisdiction
over the Indian Nation?

10
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:41,215
You know I am.

11
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:44,719
Rooster, any deputy
who shoots and kills...

12
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:47,347
64 suspects
in eight years...

13
00:03:47,423 --> 00:03:49,721
is breaking the law,
not aiding and abetting it.

14
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:53,728
Let's get this straight, Judge.
Only 60 of 'em died.

15
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:55,730
None was shot
but in the line of duty...

16
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:58,961
or in defense of my person
or fleein' justice!

17
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:03,233
You have been in the service
of this court for almost two lustrums.

18
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:06,399
You're a strong man,
and you're a brave man.

19
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:10,241
And you have, at times, executed
your duties faithfully and well.

20
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:15,579
- But all too often you have
acted with excessive zeal...
- What is a "lustrum," Judge?

21
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:18,085
- Five years. Don't interrupt me.
- Yes, sir.

22
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:20,088
- Pay attention to me.
- Yes, sir!

23
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:22,351
- This is not another formal reprimand.
- Yes, sir!

24
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:26,427
People with money go where they're
protected by the law, not shot by it!

25
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,157
Is that the kind of law
my deputy got yesterday?

26
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:32,758
I was proud to tell his wife
I shot his killers.

27
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:36,828
It seems you cannot serve the papers
of this court and effect arrests...

28
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:39,670
without breaking heads
and spraying bullets about.

29
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:42,472
The West is changing,
and you haven't changed with it.

30
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:45,275
I want your badge.

31
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:50,182
Out there in the territory, they don't
know about all these newfangled laws.

32
00:04:50,252 --> 00:04:54,780
We know, but they don't. They're still
shootin' in the same direction: At me!

33
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:57,121
Your badge, Cogburn.

34
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,861
You've let yourself go,
Rooster.

35
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:10,394
Look at your belly.
You can't even close your coat over it.

36
00:05:10,473 --> 00:05:13,874
- You drink too much.
- I ain't had a drink since breakfast,

37
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:16,878
and I only wear this coat
in your court.

38
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:19,471
It was always good enough
when you needed what was in it.

39
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:22,517
You've gone to seed, Rooster.
Gone to seed.

40
00:05:22,585 --> 00:05:24,519
[Pounds Gavel]
Next case.

41
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:34,861
[Soldier]
Whoa!

42
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,094
Lieutenant, the road's out ahead.
Rock slide.

43
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:41,864
- Can we get around it?
- No, sir.

44
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:46,203
But, uh, there's a shallow downriver.
Get the wagon across.

45
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:49,244
Column right, ho!

46
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:14,268
[Lieutenant]
Whoa!

47
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:19,768
Breed, we can't move nitro
over those logs.

48
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:23,903
It's just dead wood, sir.
It's easy to move.

49
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:28,177
Shipley, Grimm, dismount.
Start movin' those logs!

50
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,084
Rawlins, Bryant, get the ropes.
Help 'em!

51
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:57,604
[Gunshot]

52
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,481

[Horses Whinnying]

56
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,904
The war is over.

57
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:26,271
- The U.S. Cavalry lost again!
- Just like I told you.

58
00:07:31,213 --> 00:07:34,046
[Shouts, Laughing]

59
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:43,016
- Give me my money.
- Don't you trust me?

60
00:07:43,092 --> 00:07:46,755
Pay up, Hawk. You'll try takin'
the gold without me.

61
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:50,094
Don't tempt me.
Any fool can blow nitro.

62
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:53,657
The last fool that thought that
blowed himself up provin' it.

63
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,601
All right, move, fast.

64
00:08:01,677 --> 00:08:04,703
We got four days hard ridin'.
That gold shipment won't wait.

65
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:26,024
Gone to seed, have I?

66
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:33,664
Gone to seed! A man does his job,
defends the code.

67
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:36,074
What does he get
out of it?

68
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:39,512
- Disgrace and abuse!
- Judge say you abuse justice.

69
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:42,209
I abuse justice?

70
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:45,447
There ain't no justice
in the West no more.

71
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:48,786
Men with sand in their craws
being pushed aside by...

72
00:08:48,857 --> 00:08:53,885
duded-up Yankee lawyers who
won spellin' bees back home!

73

[Meowing]

74
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:01,964
- That ain't St. Louis beer.
- Kansas City.

75
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:05,666
Well, I don't like it.
Neither does Sterling.

76
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,971
- [Meows]
- Too sweet, ain't it, General?

77
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:12,041
- Well, gimme my jug.
- [Meows]

78
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:14,173
Judge Parker say lock it up.

79
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:18,208
Who's payin' the rent
around here, him or me?

80
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:21,017
You can't lock up
a man's whiskey!

81
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,285
You like that joss stick
holder over there.

82
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:26,157
- Give you one minute to get my whiskey.
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

83
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,162
I'll get it
for you!

84
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,097
Don't shoot until you've heard
what I've come to say.

85
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,067
You have said enough, Judge.

86
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:37,401
- None of it to my credit nor likin'.
- [Chuckling]

87
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:41,273
May I sit and take a drink with you
and General Sterling Price?

88
00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:46,576
- If you don't mind such seedy company.
- [Chuckles, Clears Throat]

89

Rooster...
[Sighs]

90
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:53,045
You were once the best marshal I had,
and you could be again.

91
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:57,582
[Laughs]
That account is long overdrawn.

92
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:01,652
Come now, old friend, let's
let bygones be bygones.

93
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,427
I have a most important
assignment for you.

94
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:09,733
You seem to forget, Judge.
You hung up my guns, remember?

95
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:12,330
I am retired,

96
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:15,343

and rejoicin'!

100
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:27,253
Chen Lee,
turn off the light.

101
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:30,985
No doubt you've heard
of Hawk's latest outrage.

102
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,359
Now the Army believes that nitro
was taken to commit another robbery.

103
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,625
Now the time's short.

104
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:40,896
You know the territory, and you know
the scout who set up the ambush.

105
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:44,700
- Breed? He run with Hawk now?
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.

106
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:50,370
Well, he's the best scout I ever had.
Good friend too.

107
00:10:50,446 --> 00:10:55,213
He never done a wrong thing till
he killed that Wells-Fargo agent...

108
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:57,411
and run away with the payroll
we were guardin'.

109
00:10:57,486 --> 00:10:59,750
We need a man
with grit, Cogburn.

110
00:10:59,822 --> 00:11:04,384
- The government'll be mighty
grateful if you bring Hawk in.
- How grateful?

111
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,452
For the return
of the dynamite, $500.

112
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:10,657
- For Hawk, 1,500.
- Now...

113
00:11:10,732 --> 00:11:14,998
- that is information more to my liking.
- I thought it would be.

114
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,972
Now, I want him alive.
I want him to answer to me, not to you.

115
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:23,944
- Then we'll see about your badge.
- Well, I may have to charge you
my retirement rates.

116
00:11:24,012 --> 00:11:29,109
That is double salary, double expenses.
Can you afford me?

117
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:31,675
- Rates are noted and accepted.
- [Grunts]

118
00:11:31,753 --> 00:11:34,551
A group of my deputies
will act as your posse,

119
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:36,557
but it's going to take a while
to get organized.

120
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,559
Take a while?
It’ll take a miracle!

121
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:41,790
Them lily-livered lawbookers
ain't gonna risk their necks,

122
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:45,527
- or you wouldn't be here.
- You'll need this.

123
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:48,798
Do the job and it's yours
again, permanently.

124
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:53,069
Well, it goes
against my grain, but...

125
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:55,235
I'll ride
at first light.

126
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:02,781
- [Yowling]
- Drunken cat.

127
00:12:02,851 --> 00:12:08,153
That's right, Judge, in spite of the
fact that you locked up our whiskey!

128
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:13,820
You tell them deputies to meet me
at Bagby's, if you can find any.

129
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:19,732
Well, see who they have to come to
when they got a real job to be done?

130
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:23,828
The old rat killer.
Well, I'll be in fine feather tomorrow.

131
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:27,706
- Probably got another lustrum in me.
- What is lustrum?

132
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:32,213
Five years, you Chinaman.
That's the worst of you people.

133

You come over here, we give
you all the help we can.

We offer you the hospitality of our

We must ask you not to sell

or guns
to the Indians.

159
00:14:34,236 --> 00:14:37,296
It is against the civil law
and against the laws of God.

160
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:39,966
This is the law
we go by, sister,

161

166
00:14:56,358 --> 00:15:01,796
We're gonna camp here, rest our horses,
take our pleasures as we please...

167
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:05,230
with no more preachin'
from God's servants.

168
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,792
[Eula] A brand
from the burning.

169
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,168
[Spits]
What's that you say?

170
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:15,608
Our work, sir, is to pluck brands
from the burning.

171
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:20,011
If you wouldn't be plucked yourself, you
can at least show us common courtesy.

172
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:22,550
I do believe you're better at cluckin'
than you are at pluckin'.

[Cowboys Laughing]

174
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:28,216
You're an unpleasant
sort of fellow.

175
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,952
I'm the boldest sinner
on the Arkansas River, little lady.

176
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:34,621
I do just as I please,
and I make people remember me.

177
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:37,358
Only evil can come
of your presence, sir.

178
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:40,196
Temptation is the spawn
of the devil.

179
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:43,533
- You callin' me a devil, mister?
- You do the devil's work.

180
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,476
I'd shoot a man of the cloth or a lady
just that easy, so don't provoke me.

I'm not afraid. I wear God's armor.
I do not fear what man can do to me.

182

I do not fear a skunk.
I simply do not care for his odor.

I'm warnin' you.
[Cocks Guns]

184
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:08,388
You have ridden the Hoot Owl Trail
and tasted the fruits of evil,

185
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:13,628
but justice will catch up
with you to demand payment.

The Lord is my Shepherd.
I shall not want.

187

He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

188
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:28,646
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.

189
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:32,153
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for His namesake.

- Enough of your Sunday school lessons!

193
00:16:44,065 --> 00:16:48,968
- Out of my sight, both of you!
- Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.

194
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:53,474
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

195
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:56,511
My cup runneth over.

196
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:00,309
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life.

197
00:17:00,382 --> 00:17:05,149
And I will dwell
in the house of the Lord.

Good to have you back
in the territory.

202

- You might say. Big game.

203
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:42,219
- The Hawk. You seen him?
- He went through here yesterday.

204
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,748
With a wagonload of heavy cargo.
Had nine men with him.

205
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:49,490
- Oh? Which way did they go?
- Fort Ruby way.

206
00:17:49,564 --> 00:17:53,295
The Winding Stair Mountains. Took
the old trail out of Webber's Falls.

207
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:56,360
Fort Ruby? Last time I heard of that,
it was just a memory.

208
00:17:56,438 --> 00:17:59,601
There's still a settlement
there, mostly Indians.

209
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:04,008
Run by a Yankee preacher named
Goodnight and his daughter.
I helped build a church there.

you send 'em on after me.

for them dandelions.

Why don't you rest
and have some of Winona's stew?

214
00:18:14,022 --> 00:18:17,890
Oh, I'd love to, Winona,
but the trail's too hot.

215
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:22,953
I had my druthers, I'd just pull a cork
and jaw with you all night. So long.

00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:24,965
See you later.

He can have a drink.

- Give me that stuff.
- He's thirsty.

be trouble.

You want some? Come on, take a drink.
Here, have a drink.

224
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:55,889
- See that? He's thirsty.
- Oh, you want it?

225
00:18:55,964 --> 00:18:59,092
- Want a drink? Here.
- I want him to drink every last drop.

226
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:01,101
Come on,
make him drink it.

263
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:48,556
- You're too late, lawman.
- Too late to stop 'em,
but not too late to hang 'em.

264
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,857
- What happened here?
- Last night a company of gunmen rode in,

265
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:57,030
ravaged the settlement, killed my father
and many of our Indian friends.

266

- I'm sorry.
- Wolf's family was killed last night.

They'll pay for it, son.
I promise you that. They'll pay for it.

is a lean, mean, blue-eyed villain.

- Hmm. That was Hawk, all right.

- And you will stop him?
- That's my intent.

278
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:40,981
I'll find him, arrest him, take him back
to Fort Smith for trial and punishment.

00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:44,485
- Those are my orders.
- That's one hanging I will attend.

There are nine men with him.
How can you best them?

Well, ma'am, I got
my Navy Colt sidearm...

282
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:56,622
and a Winchester rifle on my saddle
and a packet full of cartridges.

283
00:23:56,698 --> 00:23:59,929
And a prayer on your lips, I hope.
You will have need of it.

284
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:02,333
And the government
has promised me a posse.

285
00:24:02,403 --> 00:24:05,998
Which I figure will be long on promise
and short on posse.

Well, go with God, Marshal.

287
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:13,336

I'm taking you to Bagby's trading post.

You'll be safe there.
Gather your belongings.

00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:18,853
We're not going anywhere, sir.

290
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,855
I must stay here
and continue my father's work.

291
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:24,824
I will be both
preacher and teacher now.

292

I admire your sand, sister,

293
00:24:28,363 --> 00:24:31,855
but you should know that
this is no place for a woman alone.

294
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:36,870
I will look after myself, and have done
so very well all of my life, thank you.

295
00:24:36,938 --> 00:24:41,534
- I won't allow it.
- You have no say in the matter, sir.

296
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:45,875
I have a lot to say, sister. I am
the federal marshal for this territory,

297
00:24:45,947 --> 00:24:48,541
responsible
for the citizens' safety.

298
00:24:48,616 --> 00:24:52,052
Now you will pack
and come with me quietly,

299
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,918
or I'll arrest you
and take you anyway.

300
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:58,254
To whom do you think
you are talking, Marshal?

301
00:24:58,326 --> 00:25:01,420
You is to whom I think
I'm talking, sister.

302
00:25:01,496 --> 00:25:06,798
It's true, you are bigger than I am,
physically. That is all.

303
00:25:06,868 --> 00:25:09,428
I think in this situation
that is enough.

304
00:25:09,504 --> 00:25:12,598
You mean you are willing
to use brute force?

305
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:14,733
That is exactly what I mean.

306
00:25:16,644 --> 00:25:18,578
Oh.

00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:20,580
Yes.

308
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:23,412
Well, I will go.

309
00:25:23,484 --> 00:25:27,420
But not because of your threats.
Saddle our horses, Wolf.

310
00:25:27,488 --> 00:25:30,480
We'll look for grangers
to help rebuild the settlement.

311
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:36,360
You have a lot of brass, Marshal. You'll
have need of it before we are through.

313
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:42,628
To make sure
the good Lord hears me.

314
00:25:44,672 --> 00:25:48,768
Yeah.
Well...

315
00:25:48,843 --> 00:25:51,437
Go saddle
the horses, son.

316
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:29,008
Whoa.

317
00:26:57,979 --> 00:26:59,776
- They there?
- Yeah.

318
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:02,338
You pushed your luck
too far last night.

319
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:04,783
Now we got Injuns after us,
along with the law.

320
00:27:04,852 --> 00:27:06,786
We gotta risk it.
We're going through.

321
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:08,788
Hold it.

322
00:27:31,612 --> 00:27:34,046
When I signal, follow.

323
00:27:34,115 --> 00:27:37,573
When I throw this stuff,
move fast and cover your ride.

00:28:23,498 --> 00:28:28,561
[Whoops] I'd say I earned
my money today, Mr. Hawk.

329
00:28:28,636 --> 00:28:31,935
You did what I'm payin' you for.
That's all.

330
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,082
Rooster.

331
00:28:45,153 --> 00:28:49,453
Yeah, it's me
and what's left of Fort Ruby.

332
00:28:49,524 --> 00:28:52,960
I'm leavin' 'em here with you, Bagby.
Take care of 'em.

333
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:55,120
- You know Miss Goodnight.
- Mr. Bagby.

334
00:28:55,196 --> 00:28:57,357
- Are you all right?
- Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

335
00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:59,365
- Hello, Winona.
- Boy?

336
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,458
Them deputies
show up yet?

337
00:29:01,536 --> 00:29:03,800
- Not a sign of 'em.
- They ain't comin'.

338
00:29:03,938 --> 00:29:08,432
I'll bet my drunken cat on that.
Well, I ain't waitin'.

339
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:13,970
Oh, Bagby...
that is a strong-minded woman.

340
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:18,178
You be careful or she'll end up ownin'
the store and you workin' for her.

341
00:29:18,252 --> 00:29:20,220
Miss Goodnight.

342
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:24,549
Keep the faith, ma'am.
See you at the hangin'.

343
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:29,127
Wolf, come with me.

344
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:31,597
[Softly]
Protect yourself.

345
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,033
- Wolf, on my horse.
- Yes, ma'am.

346
00:29:42,276 --> 00:29:44,938
Bye-bye. Thank you.

347
00:29:45,012 --> 00:29:50,177
Bagby, I'm purchasing this Winchester,
the scabbard and those shells.

348
00:29:50,251 --> 00:29:52,776
Thank you
for your hospitality.

349
00:29:52,853 --> 00:29:57,119
- But, Miss Goodnight...
- Good-bye, sir. God bless you.

350
00:30:09,737 --> 00:30:12,399
Marshal Cogburn!

351
00:30:12,473 --> 00:30:16,341
- All right, what is it?
- We're riding with you.

352
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,571
You're ridin' nowhere
with me, sister!

353
00:30:18,646 --> 00:30:22,412
- We will not slow you down
or get in your way, sir.
- 'Cause you ain't goin'!

354
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:25,850
- We'll have to ride hard
to overtake them.
- We ain't goin'!

355
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,720
I ride hard and alone!
I eat light and sleep on the ground!

356
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,284
Understood. By my reckoning, we should
reach Cheyenne Springs by sundown.

357
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,175
Breed, hurry up!

358
00:30:58,252 --> 00:31:00,914
Hawk don't trust
a hired gun at his back.

359
00:31:00,988 --> 00:31:02,922
Just at his side
in a fight.

360
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,481
Not then neither.

361
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:08,187
Breed's not on our side.
Breed's a whore!

362
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:13,427
Hawk paid for his services. He'd sell
us out to the law if they paid better.

363
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:37,657
- [Groans]
- [Hawk] Breed!

364
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:50,399
Let's get movin'.
We're fightin' time.

365
00:31:56,644 --> 00:32:00,478
Marshal Cogburn,
just wait a minute, please.

366
00:32:00,548 --> 00:32:04,245
I-I feel that you are angry
with me.

367
00:32:04,318 --> 00:32:09,654
Ma'am, you are an almighty trial.
This is a man's work and dangerous.

368
00:32:09,724 --> 00:32:13,023
For whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.

369
00:32:13,094 --> 00:32:16,359
I will make sure of what
my father's murderers reap.

370
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:20,457
You will make sure of nothing,
sister! I will! You understand?

371
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:22,900
You do your crocheting
or fingernail fixin'...

372
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,029
or whatever it is
that women do,

373
00:32:25,106 --> 00:32:29,202
- but you stay out of my way!
- A minute, Mr. Cogburn, I'm not through.

374
00:32:29,276 --> 00:32:34,942
It came to me at Bagby's that
I must help in the pursuit of these men.

375
00:32:35,015 --> 00:32:39,247
I cannot shirk it.
You're a peace officer, Mr. Cogburn.

376
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,222
I'm sure that
you understand about duty.

377
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,088
I slept and dreamed
that life was beauty.

378
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,129
I woke and found
that life was duty.

379
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:52,565
I don't suppose that
you're familiar...

380
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:54,828
with the poems
of Ella Sturgis Hooper?

381
00:32:54,902 --> 00:32:58,303
No, ma'am, and I ain't interested
in hearing 'em recited.

382
00:32:58,372 --> 00:33:00,306
And you can forget
about your duty!

383
00:33:00,374 --> 00:33:04,902
General Lee thought it was the most
beautiful word in the English language.

384
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:07,311
What the devil do you know
about General Lee?

385
00:33:07,381 --> 00:33:09,315
That he was
a Christian gentleman,

386
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:12,716
and that he was soundly whipped
in the field by Yankees!

387
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:20,425
If they ever give 'em the vote,
God help us.

388
00:33:50,758 --> 00:33:53,693
Hawk, I need some help.

389
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:56,389
I need some help
on this wagon, Hawk.

390
00:33:56,464 --> 00:33:59,058
[Men Talking,
Indistinct]

391
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:02,694
Okay, go ahead.
Come on! Come on!

392
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,704
[Men Talking, Indistinct]

393
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:06,865
All right,
take it easy now.

394
00:34:10,044 --> 00:34:13,104
Easy!
Keep her up there.

395
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,944
- Slow her down.
- Keep it up.

396
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:19,884
- He's takin' a chance with this nitro.
- He's gamblin' for big stakes.

397
00:34:19,954 --> 00:34:23,788
With our backs. I'd rather go down
shootin' than with a broke back!

398
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:28,818
- Come on, boys. Take it easy.
- [Driver] Whoa!

399
00:34:28,896 --> 00:34:31,262
- The nitro! Hold it up!
- Support that nitro!

400
00:34:31,332 --> 00:34:34,893
- Get a probe. Get in under here.
- Leroy, get back there!

401
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:38,063
Get to pryin' here.
Hold it now.

402
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:41,630
- Let's get under it, boys.
- All right. Easy! Easy!

403
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:43,677
It ain't nothin'.
The wheel just popped.

404
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:46,508
Wedge it up and put it back on.
We'll be out of here in ten minutes.

405
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,741
The axle's broke, Hawk.

406
00:34:48,816 --> 00:34:52,081
All right, fix it!
Don't waste the time we saved.

407
00:34:52,152 --> 00:34:56,350
The axle's broke, Hawk!
It’ll take till morning to fix it.

408
00:34:56,423 --> 00:34:58,584
Nothin' is gonna keep me away
from that gold.

409
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:01,423
Nothin', you hear?
Nothin'!

410
00:35:03,063 --> 00:35:05,964
All right, I'll ride
with Breed to Goldstrike.

411
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:08,593
He'll size up the bank.
I'll see Dakota, set the plan.

412
00:35:08,669 --> 00:35:12,503
If this nitro ain't in town
by Friday, the game's over.

413
00:35:12,573 --> 00:35:17,169
Hawk! I'm gonna
ride along with you.

414
00:35:17,244 --> 00:35:20,611
I gotta get myself to a doc,
before I quits on myself.

415
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:24,310
Ride along but don't hold me back. Ain't
got time for wet-nursin' no cripple.

416
00:35:24,385 --> 00:35:28,617
- We won't let you down, boss.
- Don't. I ain't a good loser.

417
00:35:55,082 --> 00:35:57,141
Wolf, I got a hunch...

418
00:35:57,217 --> 00:36:01,677
we're just a little way
from a lot of trouble.

419
00:36:01,755 --> 00:36:06,021
Now I want you to get up there
and take a careful look all around.

420
00:36:06,093 --> 00:36:09,893
Meanwhile, I'll try and keep
her ladyship occupied.

421
00:36:09,964 --> 00:36:12,626
- Yes, sir.
- Marshal Cogburn...

422
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,295
we are here together,
and it is our obligation...

423
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,634
to be on good terms
with each other.

424
00:36:18,706 --> 00:36:22,301
As long as we limit our remarks
about the war between the states,

425
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:24,810
I don't think there'll be
any open hostility.

426
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:26,812
Sister,
why don't you step down.

427
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,816
We'll give these horses' backs a rest,
get a little stretch.

428
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:33,648
[Sighing]

429
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:38,488
Why are you called Rooster?
I never heard a man called that before.

430
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:44,156
Well, I guess in the old days,
I was cocky, kind of a struttin' bird.

431
00:36:44,231 --> 00:36:47,496
[Chuckles] Have not changed much,
as I see it.

432
00:36:47,568 --> 00:36:51,334
My tail feathers may droop
a little and my wattles show,

433
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:53,999
but I can still outcrow
anything in the barnyard.

434
00:36:54,074 --> 00:36:56,008
Ooh, there's no doubt
about that.

435
00:36:56,076 --> 00:36:58,340
But can you
outdo them too?

436
00:36:58,412 --> 00:37:03,008
Well, sister, if I couldn't, I wouldn't
have much to crow about, would I?

437
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:08,020
Well, it all depends on the barnyard,
doesn't it?

438
00:37:08,088 --> 00:37:11,524
Rooster is
your Christian name?

439
00:37:11,592 --> 00:37:16,529
My baptized name is Reuben, but
I ask you not to repeat that to nobody.

440
00:37:16,597 --> 00:37:18,531
Why not? It's a name
of which to be proud.

441
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,035
At one time, Reuben led the foremost
tribe of Israel.

442
00:37:22,102 --> 00:37:24,696
Well, it hit
rock bottom with me.

443
00:37:24,772 --> 00:37:30,142
I'm bound to ask you this. Is your name
written in the Lamb's Book of Life?

444
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,271
Oh, sister,
are you licensed to preach?

445
00:37:34,348 --> 00:37:38,341
What kind of a church do you belong to
anyway? They let women preach in it?

446
00:37:38,419 --> 00:37:41,445
I'm not an exhorter,
Mr. Cogburn.

447
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:43,786
Service to others
is my witness.

448
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:47,293
I'm a teacher and something
of a journeyman nurse.

449
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:50,797
Ayah.
I can pull teeth.

450
00:37:50,864 --> 00:37:53,526
I'm sorry that
you don't like me.

451
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,966
Oh, it ain't that I don't like you.
It's how you talk.

452
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:57,970
How would you
have me talk?

453
00:37:58,038 --> 00:38:00,302
It's my business to speak
of these things.

454
00:38:00,374 --> 00:38:02,638
It isn't that.
It's the way you talk.

455
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,544
"Ayah, ayah."
What is that business?

456
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:11,641
Oh, it's my Yankee speech itself that
you find offensive?

457
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:14,984
- I do.
- I must try to remedy that.

458
00:38:15,055 --> 00:38:18,991
Paul tells us that we must be all things
to all men.

459
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:22,995
I'll have to learn some
vulgar southern expressions.

460
00:38:23,063 --> 00:38:25,998
I'll have to learn
to be lazy and slovenly.

461
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:29,297
I'll tell you something
else that Paul said:

462
00:38:29,436 --> 00:38:32,166
Let your women
be silent in church.

463
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:34,901
How come you know
that passage?

464
00:38:34,975 --> 00:38:37,569
Well, Judge Parker's
partial to it.

465
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:40,238
You know, you're not
the only one with a Bible.

466
00:38:40,314 --> 00:38:43,579
He's got a big one.
Make two or three of yours.

467
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,244
It's not the size
that's important, Marshal,

468
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,754
but your knowledge
of its contents.

469
00:38:48,822 --> 00:38:51,757
Repent ye, therefore,
and be converted.

470
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:54,919
You have something to say from that Good
Book about every occasion, don't you?

471
00:38:54,995 --> 00:38:57,088
Ayah.
It was my primer.

472
00:38:57,164 --> 00:38:59,928
In Boston, church children learn
their letters from it.

473
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,630
I figured you for a Yankee, but you look
more like a prairie bird:

474
00:39:04,772 --> 00:39:07,332
Bony and tough.

475
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:09,841
As the only girl
in a family of boys,

476
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,346
I suspect I grew up
more forceful...

477
00:39:13,413 --> 00:39:16,177
and independent
than a woman should be.

478
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,686
[Laughing]
Amen, sister. Amen!

479
00:39:19,753 --> 00:39:22,415
Marshal,
you're prayin'.

480
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:26,357
That's the first step
on the road to salvation.

481
00:39:26,426 --> 00:39:29,862
Well, this ain't no church social
nor a revival meeting.

482
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:34,526
So don't try to convert me, sister,
or you'll end up with a... empty sack!

483
00:39:36,737 --> 00:39:39,900
Marshal Cogburn,
a wagon and riders!

484
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:20,442
[Eula]
Ayah, that's the wagon.

485
00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:25,918
- I recognize the wagon.
- Just the way I figured. But, sister...

Naturally, Marshal.

Let's go.

489
00:41:12,532 --> 00:41:17,469
Wolf, I want you
to take these horses and hide 'em.

490
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:20,802
- Then get up beyond that bend
and signal when they're comin'.
- Yes, sir.

I want you two to shoot up
in the air, make a lot of noise.

492
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:28,981
Don't shoot at 'em. You might hit
that nitro, and then we'd all be gone.

493
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:33,645
You got that straight? Here, let me
show you there. This thing's loaded.

494
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,315
All you have to do is pull that back,
point it up in the air, squeeze it.

495
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:40,827
- You understand?
- Yes, yes, I think I understand.

496
00:41:40,894 --> 00:41:43,829
- Get up there behind that broken log.
- Right.

- No, I'll remember.

You mean to say that you shot across

If you'd have hit that nitro,
you'd have killed us all.

But I didn't. And if I hadn't shot him,
you'd be dead instead of him.

What were you trying to do,
talk him to death?

532

If that could happen, ma'am,
you wouldn't have needed that rifle.

ever learn
to shoot like that?

how to shoot and equitation.

- Ayah. You know, horseback riding.

our own food.

- They don't know that.
- They may be smarter than you think.

dates that lend substance to your...

is half a man.

You cannot give weight
to the words of a drunkard.

642

- They are meaningless.
- Oh, come on, sister.

00:52:29,008 --> 00:52:32,808
Don't tell me that you stand in judgment
of a man who pulls a cork now and then.

644
00:52:32,879 --> 00:52:37,873
I do. It's a weakness that indicates
a decided lack of character.

00:52:37,951 --> 00:52:43,082
That shows you know more about the Lord
and His Good Book than you do about men.

646
00:52:43,156 --> 00:52:45,249
That's my good fortune.

647
00:52:45,325 --> 00:52:48,886
I know enough about men
to have steered clear of them.

648
00:52:48,962 --> 00:52:51,556
I had no hankerin'
to have one of my own...

649
00:52:51,631 --> 00:52:55,260
and no desire
to produce more of the same.

650
00:53:00,206 --> 00:53:03,266
Wolf.

651
00:53:03,343 --> 00:53:07,541
- Yes, sir?
- She's frightening.

652
00:53:07,614 --> 00:53:12,916
Look, uh, I got me
a.22 pepperbox here.

653
00:53:12,986 --> 00:53:16,820
Now, this thing shoots five times,
sometimes all at once.

654
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:19,357
It is called
a lady's companion,

655
00:53:19,425 --> 00:53:23,259
and that is what I intend it be used for
when I leave you two off.

656
00:53:23,329 --> 00:53:28,733
Now, back in Fort Smith,
there is a sportin' lady named Big Faye.

657
00:53:28,801 --> 00:53:31,167
She was shot twice
with this thing.

658
00:53:31,237 --> 00:53:35,196
But she dresses out
at about 290, so...

659
00:53:35,274 --> 00:53:38,334
none of the bullets found their way
to any of the vitals.

660
00:53:38,411 --> 00:53:41,380
But, against ordinary people,
this gives good service.

661
00:53:41,447 --> 00:53:43,642
Now I want you
to protect sister with it.

662
00:53:43,716 --> 00:53:46,742
Thank you, sir. I shall guard Miss Eula
with my life.

663
00:53:46,819 --> 00:53:49,811
Well, more than likely,
it'll be the other way.

664
00:53:49,889 --> 00:53:54,656
But you take good care of her.
She is somethin'.

665
00:54:20,653 --> 00:54:24,646
- You wait here for Dakota.
- I could use a drink myself.

666
00:54:24,724 --> 00:54:27,284
I only drink
with friends.

667
00:54:45,311 --> 00:54:48,576
Good shot, Marshal! You are hitting
more than you are missing now!

668
00:54:48,648 --> 00:54:52,880
Well, them that I ain't hittin', lad,
I ain't aimin' at.

669
00:54:52,952 --> 00:54:57,685
If you're not careful, Hawk's men will
hear the noise and be looking for you.

670
00:54:57,757 --> 00:55:02,421
And if they ain't careful,
they'll find me. Hurray!

671
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:07,829
[Grunts, Groans]

672
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:12,928
Hey, Wolf, chalk up
two of them things!

673
00:55:15,975 --> 00:55:21,572
Hallelujah!
[Laughing]

674
00:55:21,647 --> 00:55:24,081
Your equitation teacher
do that?

675
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,618
Marshal Cogburn,
we're ready to go.

676
00:55:26,686 --> 00:55:31,055
Shooting corn bread in a meadow
is not taking us anywhere,

677
00:55:31,124 --> 00:55:33,615
and my father's murderers
ride free.

678
00:55:33,693 --> 00:55:39,427
- Well, sister, I was just celebrating.
- Celebrating what?

679
00:55:39,499 --> 00:55:43,299
Being alive, sister,
being alive.

680
00:55:43,369 --> 00:55:46,031
You're shooting your own food.

681
00:55:46,105 --> 00:55:49,768
Whiskey is making you silly.
Why do people wish to be silly?

682
00:55:49,842 --> 00:55:55,178
Why do people wish to be sober?
Life ain't an easy game, sister.

683
00:55:55,248 --> 00:55:57,910
Don't hurt to make a fool
of yourself once in awhile.

684
00:55:57,984 --> 00:56:02,614
Yes, once in awhile,
but not more often than not.

685
00:56:02,688 --> 00:56:05,782
Marshal Cogburn,
you're in a sorry state.

686
00:56:05,858 --> 00:56:08,952
You're unsteady on your feet,
untidy in your person...

687
00:56:09,028 --> 00:56:12,555
rank with the smell of sweat
and spirits.

688
00:56:12,632 --> 00:56:17,899
Cleanliness and abstinence are next
to godliness, or had you forgotten?

689
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:23,340
No, I ain't forgotten. I ain't forgot
the naggin' schemin' ways of a woman.

690
00:56:23,409 --> 00:56:27,812
You're figurin' to take a bottle out
of my hand, put a cake of soap in it;

691
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,405
probably a Bible
for a gun in the other.

692
00:56:30,483 --> 00:56:32,713
Well, it ain't gonna work.
No bit and harness for me.

693
00:56:32,785 --> 00:56:35,845
I am what I am.
That's what I am. I...

694
00:56:35,922 --> 00:56:39,653
[Grunting]
Wolf.

695
00:56:41,627 --> 00:56:43,686
- [Softly] Give me a hand.
- Yes, sir.

696
00:56:44,931 --> 00:56:48,799
- [Grunting]
- [Groans]

697
00:56:48,868 --> 00:56:53,430
I'm fine.
[Sighs]

698
00:57:09,055 --> 00:57:14,550
~ I painted her
I painted her ~

699
00:57:14,627 --> 00:57:18,859
~~ [Mumbling]

700
00:57:18,931 --> 00:57:24,836
~ I promised her
I promised her ~

701
00:57:24,904 --> 00:57:26,997
~ A ring and a weddin'
after the beddin' ~

702
00:57:27,073 --> 00:57:29,507
~ Golden trinkets too ~

703
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:31,509
~ And I left her then
And I'm free again ~

704
00:57:31,577 --> 00:57:35,980
~ 'Cause I never
promised her when ~~

705
00:57:50,997 --> 00:57:52,931
I'll tell him.

706
00:58:04,343 --> 00:58:07,107
You made good time.
Where'd you leave the wagon?

707
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:11,206
That's why we come here so soon, Hawk.
We lost the wagon.

708
00:58:13,085 --> 00:58:16,919
A posse of marshals ambushed us.
They got Nose and Emmett.

709
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:18,923
[Gasps]

710
00:58:26,866 --> 00:58:28,800
Whiskey.

711
00:58:28,868 --> 00:58:31,666
You'd turn tail
if a jackrabbit jumped you.

712
00:58:33,372 --> 00:58:35,897
Rooster Cogburn
ain't no jackrabbit.

713
00:58:35,975 --> 00:58:37,966
Cogburn?

714
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:42,071
- Cogburn aced you?
- Yeah.

715
00:58:42,148 --> 00:58:45,584
Let's go.

716
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:48,882
- You'll never take him, Hawk.
- Yeah?

717
00:58:48,955 --> 00:58:50,889
Yeah.

718
00:58:50,957 --> 00:58:55,155
I rode scout for him
for three years, and I know.

719
00:58:55,227 --> 00:59:00,494
You take my money, you wear my brand.
Got it?

720
00:59:04,737 --> 00:59:08,332
Get your butts in the saddle.
We're ridin'.

721
00:59:23,589 --> 00:59:27,150
[Rooster] We'll make an early camp
today. This looks like a likely spot.

722
00:59:27,226 --> 00:59:29,353
Is it safe
to stop overnight, sir?

723
00:59:29,428 --> 00:59:32,693
We gotta rest these horses.
Unhitch 'em.

724
00:59:35,267 --> 00:59:40,102
Anyway, I'm not worried
about them roadrunners.

725
00:59:40,172 --> 00:59:43,869
They'll be in Goldstrike
lickin' their wounds...

726
00:59:43,943 --> 00:59:46,138
and consortin'
with lewd women.

727
00:59:46,212 --> 00:59:48,544
They won't start
after us until morning.

728
00:59:48,614 --> 00:59:51,549
Man, am I thirsty.
[Sighs]

729
00:59:51,617 --> 00:59:54,381
I'm gonna
fetch some water.

730
00:59:54,453 --> 00:59:57,286
Drinkin' water, that is.

731
00:59:57,356 --> 01:00:01,622
Washin' water I am a stranger to
and will leave to you to draw.

732
01:00:01,694 --> 01:00:04,720
Marshal Cogburn,
I'm sorry if I offended you...

733
01:00:04,797 --> 01:00:09,063
with my remarks regarding
your personal habits.

734
01:00:09,135 --> 01:00:12,730
I didn't realize that you were
of such a sensitive nature.

735
01:00:12,805 --> 01:00:15,365
Ma'am, my hide is tougher
than boot leather,

736
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:19,605
but no man alive likes to be called
high-smellin' and low-down.

737
01:00:19,678 --> 01:00:23,239
That's true. But when something
unpleasant must be said,

738
01:00:23,315 --> 01:00:25,249
it's best
to have done with it.

739
01:00:25,317 --> 01:00:27,911
A sharp knife cuts the quickest
and hurts the least.

740
01:00:27,987 --> 01:00:31,423
And oft should be left
in the scabbard.

741
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,754
You're a flash
of lightning, Marshal.

742
01:00:33,826 --> 01:00:36,158
No, I just follow
the thunder.

743
01:00:36,228 --> 01:00:39,755
Well, I'll just follow
my own advice...

744
01:00:39,832 --> 01:00:43,097
and retire to the stream
to perform my ablutions.

745
01:00:45,671 --> 01:00:49,437
Her...
Her what?

746
01:00:49,508 --> 01:00:52,966
Her, uh...
Hey, sister!

747
01:00:53,045 --> 01:00:56,105
You better be careful
movin' around out there.

748
01:00:56,182 --> 01:00:58,412
Everything that grows
in this country will either...

749
01:00:58,484 --> 01:01:00,782
bite you, stab you
or stick you.

750
01:01:00,853 --> 01:01:02,787
Will she be all right?

751
01:01:02,855 --> 01:01:08,122
Any varmint that crosses that
lady's path has met its match.

752
01:01:08,194 --> 01:01:10,458
You too, Marshal?

753
01:01:10,529 --> 01:01:14,295
She'll never get the best of me.
You can bet on that.

754
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:16,391
Why do women
always want to change a man?

755
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:18,801
- Is it the same with Indian women?
- Yes.

756
01:01:18,871 --> 01:01:22,967
Miss Goodnight would be
regarded as highly as a warrior
who performs bravely in battle.

757
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:28,810
Hmm. Well, no man wants
to put his boots under a warrior's bed.

758
01:01:28,881 --> 01:01:32,977
Hey, I heard flappin' noises
back in them trees.

759
01:01:33,052 --> 01:01:35,816
As soon as we get this camp set up,
let's go huntin'.

760
01:01:35,888 --> 01:01:39,483
Get us a turkey.
Surprise Miss Eula with a good meal.

761
01:01:39,558 --> 01:01:43,756
- I would like that very much, sir.
- Good. Good.

762
01:01:51,403 --> 01:01:54,497
This here's where
they waylaid us, Hawk.

763
01:01:54,573 --> 01:01:57,007
There was marshals
all around.

764
01:02:06,418 --> 01:02:08,682
[Sniffs]

765
01:02:08,754 --> 01:02:11,518
They can't be far.

766
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:14,184
That wagon's too heavy
to move fast...

767
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,854
and too risky
to move by night.

768
01:02:16,929 --> 01:02:19,523
[Uncorks Bottle]

769
01:02:19,598 --> 01:02:21,759
Breed, how many?

770
01:02:21,834 --> 01:02:26,032
Tracks are hard to read.
Sure as hell ain't no posse.

771
01:02:26,105 --> 01:02:28,039
What?

772
01:02:28,107 --> 01:02:31,838
Do you hear that, you stupid bastards?
He galled you!

773
01:02:31,911 --> 01:02:35,369
Now you listen to me,
all of you.

774
01:02:35,447 --> 01:02:37,881
I ain't goin' away
without that nitro!

775
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:40,214
I'll kill Rooster for it!

776
01:02:40,286 --> 01:02:44,120
And I'll kill each one of you,
you show yellow again.

777
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:46,488
Here. Drink yourself
some guts.

778
01:02:56,302 --> 01:02:58,497
[Rooster]
Hello, the camp!

779
01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:04,009
We must have hiked ten miles trying
to get a shot at a turkey.

780
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:07,568
Bagby's gun pulls left
as it fires...

781
01:03:07,646 --> 01:03:11,013
and the sight is off a little,
but it's a beauty.

782
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:15,543
- Son, we been outclassed.
- We got a mixed bag, Miss Eula.

783
01:03:15,621 --> 01:03:20,524
- An owl and a possum.
- Put them in the pot.
We'll have wilderness stew.

784
01:03:20,593 --> 01:03:23,255
You shot 'em,
skin 'em.

785
01:03:25,197 --> 01:03:28,098
[Sighs]

786
01:03:37,176 --> 01:03:41,772
Marshal, did you ever come up
against Jesse James or Billy the Kid?

787
01:03:41,847 --> 01:03:44,611
Naw, I never
ran into them folks.

788
01:03:44,683 --> 01:03:48,881
Did I ever tell you about the time Lucky
Ned Pepper and gang were chasin' me?

789
01:03:48,954 --> 01:03:51,445
- No, I'd like to hear about that.
- Ayah, tell us.

790
01:03:51,523 --> 01:03:54,788
Well, that was something.
They chased me until I got tired of it,

791
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:57,954
then I just whirled
my old horse, Bo, around,

792
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:02,467
took them reins in my teeth
and rid right at them villains.

793
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:04,968
I was shootin' my saddle pistol
with one hand...

794
01:04:05,037 --> 01:04:07,301
and whirlin' my Winchester
with the other.

795
01:04:07,373 --> 01:04:12,470
Never took aim.
Just snap shot and got 'em all.

796
01:04:12,544 --> 01:04:14,478
[Eula] Marshal, are you sure
you're not...

797
01:04:14,546 --> 01:04:16,980
stretchin' the blanket
a little bit?

798
01:04:17,049 --> 01:04:20,644
I was thinkin' you'd figure that way,
so I told it gospel.

799
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:23,483
Proof is,
I'm here and they're dead.

800
01:04:23,555 --> 01:04:27,082
- [Chuckling]
- One sad thing that day.

801
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:30,595
Lost old Bo.

802
01:04:30,663 --> 01:04:34,997
Marshal,
would you like more to eat?

803
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:38,503
No, I don't think so. I'm full.
I'll tell you what I could stand.

804
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:42,506
I'd pay three dollars
for a pickled buffalo tongue right now.

805
01:04:42,574 --> 01:04:46,271
I'd have thought you'd
had enough pickled tongue for one day.

806
01:04:46,345 --> 01:04:50,839
No, but I've had enough tongue
that's more barbed than pickled,
and mighty indigestible.

807
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:53,680
[Laughing]
I know. It often is.

808
01:04:53,752 --> 01:04:57,688
Well, sister, how do you stand
on the sin of tobacco?

809
01:04:57,756 --> 01:05:01,192
Well, I know of no passage
or verse to prove it,

810
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:05,321
but I'm quite certain
that the good Lord smokes a fine cigar.

811
01:05:05,397 --> 01:05:09,527
- Hallelujah.
- Marshal, is your eye bothering you?

812
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:11,796
I could soothe it
with a poultice.

813
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:14,202
[Rooster] Oh, no thanks, ma'am.
It's past helpin'.

814
01:05:14,273 --> 01:05:16,434
Was it a hunting accident
that cost you your eye?

815
01:05:16,508 --> 01:05:19,875
You might say that.
Huntin' Yankees.

816
01:05:19,945 --> 01:05:24,382
I lost it in the war ridin' with
Bill Anderson and Captain Quantrill.

817
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,884
[Laughs]
Times have sure changed.

818
01:05:26,952 --> 01:05:29,546
- Here I am workin' for a damned Yankee.
- [Chuckling]

819
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:31,885
But you haven't changed, sir.
You're still hunting.

820
01:05:31,957 --> 01:05:35,552
Well... I guess
I like marshalin'...

821
01:05:35,627 --> 01:05:38,562
better than anything
I've done since the war.

822
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:43,727
I like buffalo huntin', but them
big shaggies is just about gone now.

823
01:05:43,802 --> 01:05:48,739
Damn shame. I was skinnin' buffalo down
at Yellow Horse Creek, Texas.

824
01:05:48,807 --> 01:05:53,210
The pay was great, but I just
couldn't stand that open country.

825
01:05:53,278 --> 01:05:56,577
I'll bet there weren't
six trees between there and Canada.

826
01:05:56,648 --> 01:06:00,914
Oh, I love the freedom of
the open prairie. You love freedom too.

827
01:06:00,986 --> 01:06:04,080
Yeah, yeah.
I only lost it once.

828
01:06:04,156 --> 01:06:08,092
But my wife and I are
travelin' different roads now.

829
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,426
She didn't like my friends, and
she didn't like me when I was myself.

830
01:06:12,498 --> 01:06:17,765
So my drinkin' picked up.
She got a bellyful of it and left me.

831
01:06:17,836 --> 01:06:22,102
Now I'm livin' happily ever after
with my cat, General Sterling Price,

832
01:06:22,174 --> 01:06:25,268
and my friend, Chen Lee,
the Chinaman.

833
01:06:25,344 --> 01:06:27,369
They let a man be.

834
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:30,108
Be what, Marshal?

835
01:06:30,182 --> 01:06:35,119
Well, be... be hisself.
He don't have to change.

836
01:06:35,187 --> 01:06:37,621
But change is
progress, Marshal.

837
01:06:37,689 --> 01:06:41,625
You don't look too old to change.
Life is a school.

838
01:06:41,693 --> 01:06:45,789
Well, teacher, don't you start pressin'
your dress for my graduation...

839
01:06:45,864 --> 01:06:49,300
'cause I intend to stay
in my own low class,

840
01:06:49,368 --> 01:06:52,064
indefinitely!

841
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:55,038
May I have more
possum stew, ma'am?

842
01:06:55,107 --> 01:06:58,543
Opossum, Wolf. Opossum.
An American marsupial.

843
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:02,979
Oh. Wolf, maybe you better
give me some of that owl meat.

844
01:07:03,048 --> 01:07:05,642
A little of that in a Rooster's
gizzard might make me smart.

845
01:07:05,717 --> 01:07:08,311
[Laughing]
A wise old owl sat on an oak.

846
01:07:08,387 --> 01:07:10,321
The more he heard,
the less he spoke.

847
01:07:10,389 --> 01:07:12,323
The less he spoke,
the more he heard.

848
01:07:12,391 --> 01:07:14,723
Now wasn't that
a wise old bird?

849
01:07:14,793 --> 01:07:20,129
I guess there's some kind of a lesson
in that for me, for both of us.

850
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:24,499
- How many miles you think we rode today?
- Oh, about 20.

851
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:27,004
It feels like
more than that.

852
01:07:27,072 --> 01:07:31,008
Wait a minute, sister.
Maybe I can help.

853
01:07:31,076 --> 01:07:34,170
[Sighing]

854
01:07:34,246 --> 01:07:36,180
That feels good.

855
01:07:36,248 --> 01:07:39,684
I'll bet your backside
hurts worse than anything.

856
01:07:39,751 --> 01:07:41,685
Yes, well...

857
01:07:41,753 --> 01:07:44,517
[Laughs, Snorts] We can't do anything
about that, can we?

858
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:46,854
I reckon not, sister.

859
01:07:46,925 --> 01:07:49,860
[Sighing]
Better.

860
01:07:49,928 --> 01:07:52,863
The layin' on
of the hands.

861
01:07:54,266 --> 01:07:57,861
How do you happen
to know about that?

862
01:07:57,936 --> 01:08:01,531
What I know might
surprise you, sister.

863
01:08:01,607 --> 01:08:05,873
My friend, nothing about you
would surprise me.

864
01:08:05,944 --> 01:08:08,538
Oh, just a minute,
sister.

865
01:08:08,614 --> 01:08:13,210
I'll put my lariat
around your bed.

866
01:08:13,285 --> 01:08:16,277
Them night crawlers
and snakes will respect it.

867
01:08:16,355 --> 01:08:19,984
Is that really true that
they won't crawl over a rope?

868
01:08:20,058 --> 01:08:22,049
I ain't gonna say it's true.

869
01:08:22,127 --> 01:08:24,789
I ain't gonna say it ain't.
But it's comfortin'.

870
01:08:24,863 --> 01:08:28,560
[Laughs]
Thank you, Reuben.

871
01:08:30,302 --> 01:08:34,898
The Good Book says: Let not the sun
go down on thy wrath.

872
01:08:34,973 --> 01:08:37,271
I'm glad that it did not.

873
01:08:38,477 --> 01:08:40,411
Good night, sister.

874
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:44,248
- Good night, Reuben.
- Wolf, give me a hand.

875
01:08:44,316 --> 01:08:46,250
[Wolf] Yes, sir.
Good night, ma'am.

876
01:08:46,318 --> 01:08:48,309
Good night, Wolf.

877
01:08:48,387 --> 01:08:53,086
[Straining] This Gatling gun's
a little heavy.

878
01:08:53,158 --> 01:08:56,252
Set this up
for our protection.

879
01:08:56,328 --> 01:08:59,422
In case I was wrong
about them cutthroats,

880
01:08:59,498 --> 01:09:01,591
we'll still have
the advantage.

881
01:09:01,667 --> 01:09:06,263
A little chilly. Well, I guess we better
stand guard tonight...

882
01:09:06,338 --> 01:09:09,432
over there
across the creek.

883
01:09:09,508 --> 01:09:12,944
Now you take
the first watch,

884
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:15,445
and I'll spell you
around midnight.

885
01:09:15,514 --> 01:09:18,108
- Thank you. You got that pepperbox?
- Right here.

886
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:20,447
Good. Now don't use it
unless you have to.

887
01:09:20,519 --> 01:09:23,784
First sign of trouble,
you give that coyote howl...

888
01:09:23,855 --> 01:09:26,619
and hightail it
back here to camp.

889
01:09:26,692 --> 01:09:30,287
Now that big, flat rock
on that side,

890
01:09:30,362 --> 01:09:32,796
- that's a good place for lookout.
- Sir?

891
01:09:32,864 --> 01:09:36,300
- Yeah?
- Has there ever been an Indian marshal?

892
01:09:36,368 --> 01:09:39,701
- Not that I heard tell of.
- That's what I'd like to be.

893
01:09:39,771 --> 01:09:42,296
A man like you.

894
01:09:42,374 --> 01:09:46,140
You ain't aimin'
your sights very high, son,

895
01:09:46,211 --> 01:09:50,147
but if you'd like
to follow my tracks, l...

896
01:09:50,215 --> 01:09:53,082
I'll help you
up the trail and proud to.

897
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:55,813
- Thank you, sir.
- Good night, son.

898
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:57,821
Good night, sir.

899
01:10:09,735 --> 01:10:11,669
[Sighs]

900
01:10:42,768 --> 01:10:44,702
[Sighs]

901
01:10:49,274 --> 01:10:51,640
[Eula]
Reuben...

902
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:57,273
have you ever seen an enlarged
picture of a drunkard's liver?

903
01:10:59,951 --> 01:11:01,885
Damnation.

904
01:11:01,953 --> 01:11:03,887
Even in their sleep?

905
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:06,219
[Bumps Head]
Ow!

906
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:09,124
Good night, Miss Goodnight.

907
01:11:09,194 --> 01:11:12,391
[Softly]
Good night, Reuben.

908
01:11:24,643 --> 01:11:26,577
[Muffled Screaming]

909
01:11:28,814 --> 01:11:31,044
Bring him.

910
01:11:37,322 --> 01:11:42,089
Leroy, take him down there.
Go on. Spread out.

911
01:11:44,663 --> 01:11:47,154
- [Wolf Yells, Muffled]
- What?

912
01:11:50,669 --> 01:11:52,603
Stay down.
Stay down.

913
01:11:52,671 --> 01:11:55,003
Where are you?
Where are you, Wolf?

914
01:11:55,073 --> 01:11:57,234
[Hawk]
I got him, Rooster!

915
01:12:00,011 --> 01:12:02,605
- That you, Hawk?
- You know it is!

916
01:12:02,681 --> 01:12:05,775
Uh-huh. Guess you're interested
in this wagon.

917
01:12:05,851 --> 01:12:07,910
You let
that boy go!

918
01:12:07,986 --> 01:12:09,954
Stay down.

919
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:14,117
[Hawk] I will let him go, when you
give me back that wagon.

920
01:12:14,192 --> 01:12:16,217
Breed, you there?

921
01:12:16,294 --> 01:12:18,387
I'm here, Rooster.

922
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:22,126
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

923
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,532
You're the one
with a little trouble.

924
01:12:24,603 --> 01:12:28,266
I want that wagon! You ain't goin'
nowhere with it!

925
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,900
Give it to me
or I'll kill your Indian boy!

926
01:12:30,976 --> 01:12:34,036
You kill that Indian boy,
and I'll blow up this wagon.

927
01:12:34,112 --> 01:12:38,981
And hunt every one of you down
and cut you throat to throat. Oh!

928
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:43,646
All right, I'll trade that
damn wagon for the boy...

929
01:12:43,722 --> 01:12:45,986
if he ain't harmed!

930
01:12:46,057 --> 01:12:49,754
Leroy,
show him the bait.

931
01:12:49,828 --> 01:12:54,060
When they lower their guns,
break cover and rush 'em. Shoot to kill.

932
01:13:00,572 --> 01:13:05,703
All right, bring him across.
We'll stand aside.

933
01:13:08,213 --> 01:13:11,774
Marshal, it's a trick! They're gonna
kill you! [Fires Pepperbox]

934
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:14,148
[Leroy Groaning]

935
01:13:14,219 --> 01:13:16,779
[Firing Rifle]

[Gunfire Continues]

937
01:13:22,427 --> 01:13:24,987
- [Continues Firing]
- Hold your fire!

938
01:13:25,063 --> 01:13:29,693
Nice work, boy. Here, sister,
give Wolf your rifle.

939
01:13:29,768 --> 01:13:33,363
You may have the boy now, but we ain't
movin' until we get what's ours!

940
01:13:33,438 --> 01:13:35,463
And neither are you!

941
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:40,978
Well, now, I got pretty good position
here and some mean deputies.

942
01:13:41,046 --> 01:13:44,880
You're a liar, Rooster.
You ain't got no posse.

943
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:48,386
I got your Gatling gun,
and I got it set up.

944
01:13:48,453 --> 01:13:50,444
I'll give you two minutes
to cut and run...

945
01:13:50,522 --> 01:13:53,787
or I'm gonna fill you
full of holes like a sieve.

946
01:13:53,859 --> 01:13:56,794
You got the gun, but you ain't
got the know-how to use it!

947
01:13:56,862 --> 01:13:59,057
Deputy, show 'em.

948
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:02,463
[Rapid Gunfire]

949
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:08,396
[Gunfire Continues]

950
01:14:13,645 --> 01:14:18,082
Ain't that the way it works?
Now hightail it out of here...

951
01:14:18,149 --> 01:14:22,984
before I forget my promise
to Judge Parker: Bring you in alive.

952
01:14:23,054 --> 01:14:25,420
That was good, Rooster!

953
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:28,220
But the odds will change
when the sun comes up!

954
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:35,032
Spread out.

955
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,762
When he tries to move that wagon
in the morning, we'll make our play.

956
01:14:37,836 --> 01:14:40,430
- Wolf, did you see their horses?
- Yes, sir, up there.

957
01:14:40,505 --> 01:14:44,601
Uh-huh. Do you think you could
work your way up there and spook 'em?

958
01:14:44,676 --> 01:14:47,110
- I can do it, sir.
- Good man.

959
01:14:52,617 --> 01:14:54,608
You're risking
the boy's life.

960
01:14:54,686 --> 01:14:57,951
I am counting a little on
your relationship with the Lord, ma'am.

961
01:14:58,023 --> 01:15:00,617
- Can you hitch a team?
- Yes, I can hitch a team.

962
01:15:00,692 --> 01:15:03,786
I'm gonna maneuver myself over there
and get their attention.

963
01:15:03,862 --> 01:15:07,525
- You hitch up that team
and saddle those horses.
- Yes, yes.

964
01:15:20,445 --> 01:15:23,073
Hawk, you there?

965
01:15:23,148 --> 01:15:26,311
Ready to deal, Rooster!

966
01:15:26,384 --> 01:15:29,876
I'm gonna give you one last chance
to give yourself up.

967
01:15:29,955 --> 01:15:32,321
[Hawk]
Wait till daylight!

968
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:35,154
We'll see who's ready
to give up!

969
01:15:35,226 --> 01:15:39,663
I'll get you a fair trial
and a fine hanging.

970
01:15:39,731 --> 01:15:44,498
Might even get you life
at the federal house in Detroit.

971
01:15:44,569 --> 01:15:49,063
They'll teach you how to read
and write there. Of course,
the rest of it ain't so good.

972
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:52,166
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

973
01:15:52,243 --> 01:15:55,269
[Horses Whinnying]

974
01:15:55,347 --> 01:15:58,475
Get them horses!
Grab 'em!

975
01:16:11,596 --> 01:16:16,932
Good work, Wolf.
You bought us some time. Hyah!

976
01:16:19,771 --> 01:16:21,705
Hyah!

977
01:16:39,124 --> 01:16:41,058
[Laughing]

978
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:15,550
Wolf, give me a hand.

979
01:17:15,627 --> 01:17:20,121
You folks runnin'
from something or to something?

980
01:17:20,198 --> 01:17:22,564
[Rooster]
Both.

981
01:17:22,634 --> 01:17:25,296
Are you goin'
across?

982
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:28,635
We aim to use your raft.

983
01:17:28,706 --> 01:17:31,971
Ten cents for a horse and rider.
Dollar for a wagon.

984
01:17:32,043 --> 01:17:34,637
Fifty cents extra
for heavy cargo.

985
01:17:34,712 --> 01:17:37,977
A show of money is required
before passage.

986
01:17:38,049 --> 01:17:42,986
Well, I'm Rooster J. Cogburn,
Federal Marshal.

987
01:17:43,054 --> 01:17:46,820
The men I'm stalkin' are hot on my tail,
and I'm gonna need help.

988
01:17:46,891 --> 01:17:50,156
I want you to give sanctuary
to this woman and boy.

989
01:17:50,228 --> 01:17:53,664
If I'd wanted women and children here,
I'd have had my own.

990
01:17:53,731 --> 01:17:55,665
They ain't nothing
but trouble.

991
01:17:55,733 --> 01:17:57,997
So don't saddle me
with your discards.

992
01:17:58,069 --> 01:18:00,333
You ain't
very hospitable.

993
01:18:00,405 --> 01:18:03,499
I ain't got an ounce of good will in me,
and that's a fact.

994
01:18:03,575 --> 01:18:07,170
I hate everybody. I'm
a cantankerous old man, and I know it.

995
01:18:07,245 --> 01:18:10,510
I like myself better
than anyone I've ever met.

996
01:18:10,582 --> 01:18:14,018
That's how come I took this job:
To be alone with me.

997
01:18:14,085 --> 01:18:16,679
- Watch that nitro.
- What?

998
01:18:16,754 --> 01:18:19,518
Let me know
if you decide to go across.

999
01:18:19,591 --> 01:18:21,855
I can't stay out in this heat
any longer.

1000
01:18:21,926 --> 01:18:24,520
The sun is frying
my brains.

1001
01:18:26,264 --> 01:18:29,358
The only way I can
get this stuff down...

1002
01:18:29,434 --> 01:18:33,029
to Sulphur Bottom
is downriver.

1003
01:18:33,104 --> 01:18:35,368
What am I gonna do
with you two?

1004
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,704
It's too risky
to leave you here.

1005
01:18:37,775 --> 01:18:41,541
Maybe I can land you someplace
before the shootin' starts.

1006
01:18:41,613 --> 01:18:43,547
Old man!

1007
01:18:43,615 --> 01:18:46,379
- Are you goin' across?
- No.

1008
01:18:47,886 --> 01:18:51,686
We're gonna go downriver.
We're loanin' the raft off you.

1009
01:18:51,756 --> 01:18:53,883
That ain't loanin'!
That's stealin'!

1010
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:56,222
Am I gonna have
trouble with you?

1011
01:18:56,294 --> 01:18:59,991
Not a teeny-weeny bit,
as long as you got that.

1012
01:19:00,064 --> 01:19:03,864
I'm securin' this for the law,
and the law will pay off.

1013
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:06,233
I ain't got much use
for the law.

1014
01:19:06,304 --> 01:19:08,329
'Course, it ain't got
much use for me neither.

1015
01:19:08,406 --> 01:19:11,398
Is there any law says you can't
help us unload this thing?

1016
01:19:11,476 --> 01:19:15,037
- Not if it'll get you
out of here any faster.
- Well, there you are.

1017
01:19:15,113 --> 01:19:17,911
Do you know anything
about ridin' a raft?

1018
01:19:17,982 --> 01:19:20,075
There's rough water
downriver.

1019
01:19:20,151 --> 01:19:23,245
I know how to ride a horse.
Couldn't be much different.

1020
01:19:23,321 --> 01:19:25,915
You ain't no sailor.
I can see that.

1021
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:30,256
Water is like a woman:
Sly and fickle.

1022
01:19:30,328 --> 01:19:32,922
You gotta keep your eye
on it every minute.

1023
01:19:32,997 --> 01:19:37,991
- You a sailor?
- I was once. McCoy's my name.

1024
01:19:38,069 --> 01:19:41,937
Been around the Horn.
Sailed the seven seas.

1025
01:19:42,006 --> 01:19:45,100
Seen everything.
Done everything.

1026
01:19:45,176 --> 01:19:50,113
That's how I know that people are
so miserable. I've seen 'em all.

1027
01:19:50,181 --> 01:19:52,115
You're wrong, old man!

1028
01:19:52,183 --> 01:19:57,280
We're made in God's image, His goodness
is a part of all of us! Even you!

1029
01:19:57,355 --> 01:20:00,449
Amazing! I never took you
for a Bible thumper!

1030
01:20:00,525 --> 01:20:04,621
Hold it, mister. She is what she is
'cause that's what she wants to be.

1031
01:20:04,696 --> 01:20:07,290
That's the way you'll take her,
and that's the way I take her.

1032
01:20:07,365 --> 01:20:11,802
You're wasting your time
preachin' at me. You too, sister.

1033
01:20:11,869 --> 01:20:13,962
I'm a ship that
can't be salvaged.

1034
01:20:14,038 --> 01:20:17,804
With God,
all things are possible.

1035
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:20,537
[Grumbling]

1036
01:20:20,612 --> 01:20:24,480
You're sure shippin' out
with a strange crew.

1037
01:20:24,549 --> 01:20:26,813
I'll match their mettle
against most.

1038
01:20:26,884 --> 01:20:29,148
Well, I'm glad it's your command,
not mine.

1039
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:34,817
Women can no more keep their mouths shut
than a yellowtail catfish.

1040
01:20:34,892 --> 01:20:37,486
Gotta agree
with you there.

1041
01:20:52,176 --> 01:20:54,667
We'll ride ahead and take 'em
at the narrows.

1042
01:20:54,746 --> 01:20:57,681
Breed, you and Luke river trail 'em.
Keep 'em in sight.

1043
01:20:57,749 --> 01:21:00,183
Join us at the narrows,
just ahead of 'em.

1044
01:21:05,089 --> 01:21:07,819
[McCoy Shouting]
Hold your course!

1045
01:21:07,892 --> 01:21:12,693
Keep that rudder amidships when you hit
that white water downriver.

1046
01:21:12,764 --> 01:21:16,461
Ain't nobody ever shot
them rapids on a raft before.

1047
01:21:16,534 --> 01:21:22,097
You just take care of my horses,
Commodore. I'll be back for 'em.

1048
01:21:22,173 --> 01:21:26,906
Don't you crack up my vessel
on them rocks! You hear me?

1049
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:41,383
[Eula]
It's so lovely here.

1050
01:21:41,459 --> 01:21:44,826
I wish we could sail
right on down to the sea.

1051
01:21:44,896 --> 01:21:48,730
Right now, Webber Falls
would be more to my liking.

1052
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,032
We'll get there tomorrow,
with the good Lord's help.

1053
01:21:53,104 --> 01:21:56,130
[Laughing]

1054
01:21:56,207 --> 01:21:59,574
Sir, would you really have killed
those men with the Gatling gun?

1055
01:21:59,644 --> 01:22:01,578
They believed I would.

1056
01:22:01,646 --> 01:22:05,980
In a pinch, a convincing lie is as good
as a posse, sometimes better.

1057
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:10,248
Marshal, tell me more about some
of the outlaws and how you bested them.

1058
01:22:10,321 --> 01:22:13,813
- Oh, well...
- If you gentlemen will excuse me,

1059
01:22:13,891 --> 01:22:16,257
I'll go and have a little sleep.

1060
01:22:16,327 --> 01:22:20,093
I've had enough of your
derring-do for one day.

1061
01:22:21,599 --> 01:22:23,760
Yeah.

1062
01:22:23,835 --> 01:22:27,771
- You ever heard of Abilene?
- No.

1063
01:22:27,839 --> 01:22:33,607
Well, I was there once lookin'
for a bunco steerer named 21-Jewel Slim.

1064
01:22:33,678 --> 01:22:37,944
That Abilene is the worst place
I have ever saw.

1065
01:22:38,015 --> 01:22:40,279
It is a sink of crime.

1066
01:22:40,351 --> 01:22:42,751
Why, I was standin'
on Horse Thief Corner,

1067
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:45,789
when Prairie Rose come down
the middle of the street...

1068
01:22:45,857 --> 01:22:47,984
with nothin' on
but her two six-guns.

1069
01:22:48,059 --> 01:22:52,587
- She was stark naked
and painted up one side...
- [Eula] Wolf...

1070
01:22:52,663 --> 01:22:54,858
stop polin'
and get some rest.

1071
01:22:54,932 --> 01:23:00,302
- You've got to spell
Marshal Cogburn tonight.
- Yes, ma'am.

1072
01:23:02,707 --> 01:23:05,835
What color was she painted,
Reuben?

1073
01:23:30,902 --> 01:23:36,169
Breed, ain't no love lost
between you and Hawk or him and me.

1074
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:40,006
If you was willing to quit him now
and join up with me,

1075
01:23:40,077 --> 01:23:42,341
I think we could take
the raft ourselves...

1076
01:23:42,413 --> 01:23:45,007
and be rich men
instead of dead ones.

1077
01:23:45,082 --> 01:23:47,016
You game?

1078
01:23:48,753 --> 01:23:52,689
Maybe.
What's your plan?

1079
01:23:54,592 --> 01:23:57,026
Come on, I'll show you.

1080
01:24:26,123 --> 01:24:29,889
We'll lay the rope underneath the water
so they can't see it.

1081
01:24:29,961 --> 01:24:34,625
When they get up to it,
it'll pull tight and stop 'em.

1082
01:24:34,699 --> 01:24:40,569
Old Rooster, he's gonna
wanna cut that rope...

1083
01:24:40,638 --> 01:24:44,734
or stretch it up
and float the raft underneath.

1084
01:24:44,809 --> 01:24:47,676
That's when I get me
a good shot at him...

1085
01:24:47,745 --> 01:24:50,578
without a chance
of blowing the nitro.

1086
01:24:50,681 --> 01:24:52,945
You kill
the other two.

1087
01:24:53,017 --> 01:24:54,951
We'll land
the cargo later.

1088
01:24:55,019 --> 01:24:57,510
What makes you think
this is gonna work?

1089
01:24:57,588 --> 01:24:59,613
It’ll work, partner.

1090
01:25:41,732 --> 01:25:45,862
Now what?
Take this tiller, Wolf.

1091
01:25:47,405 --> 01:25:49,566
What's holdin' us up?
Something's foul here.

1092
01:26:02,353 --> 01:26:04,480
[Breed]
Rooster, cut it loose.

1093
01:26:04,555 --> 01:26:07,683
Breed?

1094
01:26:07,758 --> 01:26:10,352
Yeah.

1095
01:26:10,428 --> 01:26:12,794
You saved my life once.

1096
01:26:12,863 --> 01:26:15,661
- Now we're even.
- Grateful to you.

1097
01:26:16,867 --> 01:26:20,030
Hawk's waitin'
for you downriver.

1098
01:26:20,104 --> 01:26:22,436
I can't help you there.

1099
01:26:22,506 --> 01:26:27,375
Well...
we'll be ready for him.

1100
01:26:39,357 --> 01:26:42,383
- [Horse Whinnying, Galloping]
- Someone's comin'.

1101
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:45,554
- [Cocks Rifle]
- [Breed] It's me, Hawk.

1102
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:48,724
What the hell you doin' here?

1103
01:26:48,799 --> 01:26:50,824
Where's Luke?

1104
01:26:50,901 --> 01:26:53,062
He's dead.

1105
01:26:53,137 --> 01:26:56,664
We shot it out with Rooster.
Luke lost.

1106
01:26:56,741 --> 01:26:59,209
I told you to track him,
not take him!

1107
01:27:01,646 --> 01:27:03,580
What happened?

1108
01:27:03,648 --> 01:27:05,912
Tried to stop the raft with a rope
across the river.

1109
01:27:05,983 --> 01:27:09,180
Rooster cut it
and got away.

1110
01:27:09,253 --> 01:27:12,745
We gun fought him,
but, uh...

1111
01:27:12,823 --> 01:27:16,224
Hell, Hawk,
he's just too good for us.

1112
01:27:16,293 --> 01:27:18,591
Let me see your gun.

1113
01:27:20,831 --> 01:27:23,265
You don't want my gun.

1114
01:27:23,334 --> 01:27:26,303
Oh, yes, I do.

1115
01:27:51,028 --> 01:27:54,464
You know, Breed here,

1116
01:27:54,532 --> 01:27:57,695
he gun fought old Rooster
with just one bullet.

1117
01:28:00,604 --> 01:28:02,970
You're a liar, Breed.

1118
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:06,874
I owed him one.

1119
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:16,113
[Breed Screaming]

1120
01:28:27,465 --> 01:28:32,596
I wish this thing had
a little more giddyap to it.

1121
01:28:38,809 --> 01:28:42,609
I picked these blackberries yesterday,
Reuben. Would you like some?

1122
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:46,116
Oh, no. Not for me.
I have to be careful.

1123
01:28:46,183 --> 01:28:49,277
- I can't eat just anything. I get colic.
- Hmm?

1124
01:28:49,353 --> 01:28:54,120
Of course, my mouth
is slickerin' for one thing.

1125
01:28:54,191 --> 01:28:59,788
Chen Lee's corn bread, fried
in a big ladle of coon meat grease.

1126
01:28:59,864 --> 01:29:04,130
Yes. Well, when we get back
to Fort Smith,

1127
01:29:04,201 --> 01:29:07,295
I'd like to meet Mr. Lee
and get his recipe.

1128
01:29:07,371 --> 01:29:10,067
Will we get back, Reuben?
What are our chances?

1129
01:29:10,141 --> 01:29:15,306
The odds are the same, sister.
They ain't in our favor.

1130
01:29:17,214 --> 01:29:20,479
When you drop us off
at Webber's Falls...

1131
01:29:20,551 --> 01:29:23,816
and go out after them,

1132
01:29:23,888 --> 01:29:26,823
you will be careful,
won't you, Reuben?

1133
01:29:26,891 --> 01:29:31,487
Wolf and I care about you,
very much.

1134
01:29:31,562 --> 01:29:34,827
Well, ma'am...
I don't know much...

1135
01:29:34,899 --> 01:29:38,494
about thoroughbreds,
horses or women.

1136
01:29:38,569 --> 01:29:40,662
Them that I did know,
I never liked.

1137
01:29:40,738 --> 01:29:45,300
They're too nervous and spooky.
They scare me.

1138
01:29:45,376 --> 01:29:48,573
But you're one highbred filly
that don't.

1139
01:29:48,646 --> 01:29:51,171
I don't know what you're
talkin' about half the time,

1140
01:29:51,248 --> 01:29:54,183
but that don't matter.

1141
01:29:54,251 --> 01:29:58,517
Bein' around you pleases me.

1142
01:30:00,591 --> 01:30:05,824
Those are about the nicest words I ever
heard said to me. Thank you, Reuben.

1143
01:30:05,896 --> 01:30:08,194
Well, uh...

1144
01:30:08,265 --> 01:30:11,029
Wolf, I'll spell you.

1145
01:31:32,182 --> 01:31:34,116
[Whistles]

1146
01:31:35,519 --> 01:31:37,453
[Whistles]

1147
01:31:53,103 --> 01:31:56,129
We got you now, Rooster,
you old fraud!

1148
01:31:56,206 --> 01:32:00,006
Throw your guns in the water, pull that
scow ashore and keep your hands high!

1149
01:32:02,279 --> 01:32:04,713
And don't try nothin'!
You'll be dead by breakfast!

1150
01:32:04,782 --> 01:32:09,583
That's a rattlesnake's warnin'!
You squat assassin!

1151
01:32:09,653 --> 01:32:12,144
Your schemin' ain't gonna
help you now, Rooster!

1152
01:32:12,222 --> 01:32:16,124
[Rooster] Don't you rely on it, Hawk!
Don't you rely on it!

1153
01:32:20,331 --> 01:32:22,458
[Laughing]

1154
01:32:27,871 --> 01:32:29,896
That'll keep their heads down.

1155
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:34,334
[Fires Rifle]

1156
01:32:41,418 --> 01:32:45,252
[Rapid Gunfire]

1157

[Laughing, Firing]

1158
01:32:55,733 --> 01:32:59,863
- There's one!
- [Rapid Gunfire]

1159
01:33:03,107 --> 01:33:05,200
Don't hit the nitro.
Shoot wide of 'em.

1160
01:33:05,275 --> 01:33:07,209
Force 'em into the bank.

1161
01:33:10,914 --> 01:33:14,213
- [Rapid Gunfire]
- [Laughing]

1162
01:33:30,801 --> 01:33:34,362
[Rapid Gunfire]

1163
01:34:01,432 --> 01:34:04,265
Them rapids
will get him now.

1164
01:34:05,669 --> 01:34:09,036
No... I will.

1165
01:34:09,306 --> 01:34:12,798
The Lord is with us.

1166
01:34:12,876 --> 01:34:16,004
So is that current.

1167
01:34:18,882 --> 01:34:22,818
If He owes you any favors, lady,
now's the time to collect.

1168
01:34:22,886 --> 01:34:25,047
Get out of the way, Wolf.

1169
01:34:28,325 --> 01:34:30,486
All right,
brace yourself.

1170
01:34:41,705 --> 01:34:44,173
[Screams]

1171
01:34:55,552 --> 01:34:59,147
- God help us!
- If He does, I'll give up drinkin'!

1172
01:35:16,607 --> 01:35:21,203
The gun! The gun, Reuben!
We've lost the gun!

1173
01:35:21,278 --> 01:35:24,873
[Rooster] Well, now, sister, just what
the hell can I do about it?

1174
01:35:44,301 --> 01:35:46,895
The rope!

1175
01:35:48,805 --> 01:35:50,864
Watch it there, sister!

1176
01:35:50,941 --> 01:35:53,637
Hold tight!

1177
01:36:13,897 --> 01:36:16,730
Oh, no!

1178
01:36:34,484 --> 01:36:36,782
[Sighs]

1179
01:36:36,853 --> 01:36:38,787
You all right, sister?

1180
01:36:38,855 --> 01:36:41,119
I don't know.
Am I all right?

1181
01:36:41,191 --> 01:36:43,955
I don't know.
How did we do it?

1182
01:36:44,027 --> 01:36:47,292
Your friend
must have been on the job.

1183
01:36:47,364 --> 01:36:51,300
[Laughing]
I guess He must have...

1184
01:36:51,368 --> 01:36:54,132
been on the job.

1185
01:36:54,204 --> 01:36:57,173
My God!
[Laughs]

1186
01:36:57,241 --> 01:37:00,699
[Both Laughing]

1187
01:37:04,414 --> 01:37:06,848

1188
01:37:08,552 --> 01:37:11,282
[Sighs]

1189
01:37:11,355 --> 01:37:13,516
[Horse Whinnying]

1190
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:15,558
Marshal, look!

1191
01:37:23,867 --> 01:37:25,801
It's a showdown.

1192
01:37:25,869 --> 01:37:29,703
Well... we did
the best we could.

1193
01:37:29,773 --> 01:37:33,709
Sister, I ain't never had a fight
I didn't finish standin' up.

1194
01:37:33,777 --> 01:37:36,041
We'll finish this one,
maybe not standin' up.

1195
01:37:36,113 --> 01:37:39,276
But we'll finish it
the way we planned it.

1196
01:37:39,349 --> 01:37:42,216
Come on, Wolf.
Get those lines loose.

1197
01:37:43,787 --> 01:37:47,780
Have a care with that nitro.
Easy does it.

1198
01:38:18,922 --> 01:38:23,416
Now... ease them boxes
into the water.

1199
01:38:23,493 --> 01:38:25,984
Remember,
it's nitro glycerin.

1200
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:03,294
Well...

1201
01:39:03,367 --> 01:39:05,631
we'll see.

1202
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:29,416
They never made it, Hawk.

1203
01:39:35,399 --> 01:39:37,333
Yeah, but the nitro did.

1204
01:39:53,417 --> 01:39:55,351
[Rooster]
Now.

1205
01:39:58,522 --> 01:40:00,456
Hold your fire!

1206
01:40:01,958 --> 01:40:06,918
Marshal Cogburn
is injured and dying.

1207
01:40:06,997 --> 01:40:09,124
Take your dynamite,

1208
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:12,100
but give us safe passage
down the river.

1209
01:40:12,169 --> 01:40:14,637
Sure, lady,
we'll do that.

1210
01:40:14,704 --> 01:40:16,638
We'll just
take that load,

1211
01:40:16,706 --> 01:40:19,573
and then we'll send you
and your hero on your way.

1212
01:40:19,643 --> 01:40:21,668
Straight to hell.
Come on.

1213
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,454
Now, Reuben.

1214
01:40:41,364 --> 01:40:45,323
Payday!
Come and get it, boys!

1215
01:40:45,402 --> 01:40:47,393
Payday!

1216
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:34,216
Well...
we won the battle,

1217
01:41:34,284 --> 01:41:36,548
but I lost my job.

1218
01:41:38,955 --> 01:41:41,685
Maybe not.

1219
01:41:41,758 --> 01:41:46,218
See, Judge, the Lord could very easily
have struck down the Midianites...

1220
01:41:46,296 --> 01:41:50,824
and the Amalekites with a wave of
His mighty hand, but He didn't do that.

1221
01:41:50,901 --> 01:41:53,734
He raised up a Gideon
with which to smite them.

1222
01:41:53,803 --> 01:41:56,067
An ordinary man,
like the marshal there.

1223
01:41:56,139 --> 01:41:59,905
- It's in the book of Judges, Judge.
- I know where it is, madam.

1224
01:41:59,976 --> 01:42:03,912
Very ingenious defense.
It takes one's breath away.

1225
01:42:03,980 --> 01:42:08,747
But I do not believe the Lord has
raised up a Gideon here at Fort Smith.

1226
01:42:08,818 --> 01:42:13,414
No. If He's raised up anything,
I fear it's a Rooster.

1227
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:18,223
A willful, strutting old bird who hasn't
paid any attention to the criminal code.

1228
01:42:18,295 --> 01:42:21,059
But he has!
I killed that criminal trash!

1229
01:42:21,131 --> 01:42:23,099
- Not Marshal Cogburn!
- What?
- [Parker] Sit down!

1230
01:42:23,166 --> 01:42:25,259
[Eula] He wanted him hung here,
at your convenience,

1231
01:42:25,335 --> 01:42:27,269
- Oh, back up, sister!
- But I couldn't do that!

1232
01:42:27,337 --> 01:42:29,703
- Silence in this court!
- My father's honor was at stake!

1233
01:42:29,773 --> 01:42:32,105
- Shut up! [Pounds Gavel]
- He was shot...

1234
01:42:32,175 --> 01:42:37,112
Will you take Reuben's
word for it or mine?

1235
01:42:39,349 --> 01:42:42,443
- Reuben?
- [Sighs]

1236
01:42:42,519 --> 01:42:46,455
Well, in view of past
experience with Reuben,

1237
01:42:46,523 --> 01:42:48,616
I'm afraid
I'll have to take yours.

1238
01:42:48,692 --> 01:42:50,785
Get back on the rail,
sister.

1239
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:53,294
This man may pull
a cork now and then,

1240
01:42:53,363 --> 01:42:55,456
but he's as straight
as a string.

1241
01:42:55,532 --> 01:42:59,434
- Now you're back on the rail.
- He's the best marshal you have,
and he's worth more money...

1242
01:42:59,502 --> 01:43:03,734
- than you pay him!
- Reuben, you are reinstated,
and this court is recessed...

1243
01:43:03,807 --> 01:43:06,037
and dismissed!
[Pounds Gavel, Groans]

1244
01:43:08,878 --> 01:43:10,937
Reinstated.

1245
01:43:11,014 --> 01:43:12,948
Yeah. Yeah!

1246
01:43:13,016 --> 01:43:15,541
- [Wolf] Congratulations, Marshal.
- Oh, well...

1247
01:43:15,619 --> 01:43:18,816
[Chinese]
...Reuben.

1248
01:43:18,888 --> 01:43:21,152
[Rooster]
Damn Chinaman.

1249
01:43:21,224 --> 01:43:24,489
There is one thing
I would like to get straight.

1250
01:43:24,561 --> 01:43:27,621
We both know that the Lord
brands lyin' a sin.

1251
01:43:27,697 --> 01:43:31,224
You think He'll still smile on you
after them whoppers you told in there?

1252
01:43:31,301 --> 01:43:34,668
And if thy words stray from the truth
for the good of God's own,

1253
01:43:34,738 --> 01:43:38,834
if thy intent be pure,
thou shalt not then be judged sinful.

1254
01:43:38,908 --> 01:43:41,843
Beautiful quotation.
What book? What chapter?

1255
01:43:41,911 --> 01:43:46,678
I will confess, Reuben, it is
of my own invention. I just made it up.

1256
01:43:46,816 --> 01:43:50,684
Hallelujah and jubilee!
That is one quotation I will remember.

1257
01:43:50,754 --> 01:43:53,484
And will you remember us too,
Reuben?

1258
01:43:53,556 --> 01:43:56,889
Longer than I'll remember
that quotation, Miss Eula.

1259
01:44:01,998 --> 01:44:04,592
We found five families...

1260
01:44:04,668 --> 01:44:08,661
who will homestead at Fort Ruby
and help us resettle it.

1261
01:44:08,738 --> 01:44:13,232
Will you see us off tomorrow at the
Texas Road? We join the wagon train.

1262
01:44:13,309 --> 01:44:15,607
I will consider it
a privilege, ma'am.

1263
01:44:19,349 --> 01:44:24,787
Well, ma'am...
this is where our trails part.

1264
01:44:24,854 --> 01:44:26,845
Maybe they'll
cross again, Reuben.

1265
01:44:26,923 --> 01:44:30,359
Well, that's something I think
I'd like to drink to, ma'am.

1266
01:44:30,427 --> 01:44:33,294
After that vow
you took on the river?

1267
01:44:33,363 --> 01:44:38,733
When a soul needs revivin',
thou shalt reach for help.

1268
01:44:38,802 --> 01:44:43,466
- Book and chapter?
- Rooster Cogburn, 1880.

1269
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:45,770
Will you join me, ma'am?

1270
01:44:45,842 --> 01:44:50,040
Well, maybe I will try
just a little sip.

1271
01:44:50,113 --> 01:44:52,206
To someday.

1272
01:44:58,388 --> 01:45:00,322
Someday.

1273
01:45:05,462 --> 01:45:08,829
- Good-bye, Marshal.
- Good-bye, son.

1274
01:45:11,968 --> 01:45:14,198
Good-bye, Reuben.

1275
01:45:17,574 --> 01:45:20,008
Watch your drinkin',
ma'am.

1276
01:45:20,076 --> 01:45:25,013
And if you ever have need of
a one-eyed, old peace officer...

1277
01:45:28,084 --> 01:45:30,678
Reuben, I have to say it.

1278
01:45:30,754 --> 01:45:33,018
Livin' with you
has been an adventure...

1279
01:45:33,089 --> 01:45:36,024
any woman would relish
for the rest of time.

1280
01:45:36,092 --> 01:45:40,791
I look at you, with your burnt-out face
and your big belly...

1281
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:45,028
and your bear-like paws
and your shining eye,

1282
01:45:45,101 --> 01:45:48,969
and I have to say you're a credit
to the whole male sex,

1283
01:45:49,038 --> 01:45:51,598
and I'm proud
to have you for my friend.

1284
01:45:55,512 --> 01:46:01,041
I'll be damned if she didn't get
the last word in again.

1285
01:46:01,117 --> 01:46:03,517
Well...
