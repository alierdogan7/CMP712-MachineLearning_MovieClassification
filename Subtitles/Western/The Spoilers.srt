1
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:19,564
You wanna get rich in this country
you oughta marry a hen! - I did.

2
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:22,483
OnIy she can't Iay no eggs!

3
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:28,889
No, not for 200. Not for any amount.

4
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:33,521
I gotta have a room.
- I teII ya, I just ain't got a room.

5
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:35,877
Wait a minute.

6
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,439
Guest just checkin' out.

7
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:42,688
Lee Marcus.
Take 24, right on down the haII.

8
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:44,204
Much obIiged.

9
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,842
Wait a minute, FIapjack! Wait!

10
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:54,047
What you aiming to do?

11
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:59,204
I'm gettin' me a gun, some Iiquor
and a goId commissioner.

12
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,884
Snake juice and pIenty of it! - What
you doin' in town? CIean Peter out?

13
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:18,248
If we had, them mangy warthogs
wouIdn't have jumped us. - You too?

14
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:21,561
Sure. We were just
workin' aIong kind of peacefuI-Iike

15
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,529
when at Ieast 20 of 'em jumped us.
What chance did we have?

16
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:26,760
You stiII got your gun, ain't ya?

17
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:30,081
You mean FIapjack was chased
off his cIaim and didn't do nothin'?

18
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:31,679
Oidn't do nothin'?

19
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:36,719
He poIIuted their guts with Ianguage
that shouIdn't be inside of no man!

20
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,848
But what good did it do?
They had the Iaw with 'em.

21
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:44,765
What are we, a Iot of sIeepin' Indians
to take a thing Iike this Iayin' down?

22
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:48,320
What you gonna do about it?
- I'II teII ya what I'm gonna do.

23
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,961
I'm gettin' me a gun. And anyone that
comes aIong'II see pIenty of action.

24
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:56,645
If it's action you boys want
the games are open.

25
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:01,122
The roof's the Iimit, and if you're
reaIIy pIayfuI I'II take that off too.

26
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:05,681
Cherry, that ain't the kind of action
we mean. - Is there some other kind?

27
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:09,843
Yes, Ma'am. They stoIe my cIaim, and I
ain't gonna take it sittin' down!

28
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:12,519
Oh, you're gonna
do some shootin', FIapjack?

29
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:16,126
You bet I am!
And some hittin' what I shoot at!

30
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,963
Now, now, now.
Maybe we better think this over.

31
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:24,563
I don't wanna find you under that oId
sycamore, with your feet dangIing.

32
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:28,200
But you grubstaked me to this cIaim
yourseIf. - So I have a say in it.

33
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:31,760
You and Banty have another drink
and stay here.

34
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:37,239
They jump from one cIaim to another,
Iike grasshoppers, Bronco. - Yeah.

35
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:41,642
Seems you can take away a man's cIaim
just by fiIing an affidavit.

36
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,358
So far, they're onIy the smaII ones.
- Meaning what?

37
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:48,762
No reason their system can't work with
the big cIaims. - Such as the Midas?

38
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:50,841
With both owners away, why not?

39
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:56,448
A visit to the goId commissioner ...?
What's his name? - AIexander McNamara.

40
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:00,762
ShaII I ... drop in on him?
- No.

41
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:05,640
First Iet's do
a IittIe checking up. My way.

42
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:24,128
Ravishing as usuaI, Miss MaIotte.
- GIad to see you're out of jaiI.

43
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:29,239
A temporary arrangement onIy. I'II be
back in again by nightfaII, I daresay.

44
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:36,117
WeII, weII, Miss MaIotte!

45
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:40,317
It's certainIy a pIeasure to see you.
- Thank you, Mr Montrose.

46
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:44,483
I want some information
about FIapjack Simm's cIaim.

47
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,083
Simms?

48
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:52,324
Here we are. That's been reIocated.

49
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,323
Oh, it has? Under whose name?

50
00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:01,361
Why, a Mr CIark and a Mr Bennett.
We have their affidavit right here.

51
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:03,839
Oh yes, here we are.

52
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:08,598
Now, see ...

53
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:12,843
Can I see this, Monte?
You won't mind

54
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:14,841
if I borrow this, wiII you, Monte?

55
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:25,242
Nice pIace to keep my records, but
the question is, what about access?

56
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:27,844
You got to that one easy enough.
- Oidn't I?

57
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:33,607
I'm Cherry MaIotte. I suppose you're
Mr McNamara. - G.C. GoId Commissioner.

58
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:36,443
TeII the marshaI
I want to see him, Montrose.

59
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:42,003
Putting me in jaiI, Mr McNamara?
- Serious business, steaIing records.

60
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,240
As serious as cIaim jumping?

61
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:48,563
Got some particuIar case in mind?

62
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:52,882
The cIaim of FIapjack Simms.
I know he made the originaI discovery.

63
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:57,566
CIark and Bennett swear they fiIed in
the spring, but they weren't here yet.

64
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:00,279
So I want this affidavit as evidence.

65
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:05,044
Strong taIk. But I'm here to protect
the interests of the smaII owner.

66
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:08,957
But if you happened to be smart

67
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:12,759
you couId do yourseIf
a Iot of good, couIdn't you?

68
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:15,524
I'm wondering just how smart you are.

69
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:19,683
WeII, I've been educated.
- So have I.

70
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:23,764
I don't care how you operate ...
I mean, with two exceptions.

71
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:26,808
The Simms cIaim.
- And a certain mine, the Midas.

72
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:31,202
That's puts us into the big money.
Got an interest in the Midas?

73
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:33,647
Stock?
- No, not exactIy.

74
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:38,406
Oh, personaI. One of the partners?
GIennister? - We're acquainted.

75
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:43,405
I don't know much about him, but
I'd say he has good taste. - Thanks.

76
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:48,166
He does aII right in other ways too.
Not a man to be pushed around.

77
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,720
Big feIIer, eh?
Might he make it interesting

78
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:54,927
if I wanted
to move into his territory?

79
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:00,438
CouId be tough going, mister.
- But worth it.

80
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:02,757
So?

81
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,362
What's this I hear
about me arresting Miss MaIotte?

82
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:12,638
No. I want to see CIark and Bennett.
A few questions I want to ask them.

83
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:16,519
WeII, Cherry, I ... - Some other time.
- You'II aIways be weIcome.

84
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,885
You work fast, commissioner.
- Thank you.

85
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:24,921
And since you have a safer pIace
to store papers, you better keep this.

86
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,680
WeII, I couId be wrong.

87
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,479
If I came into the Northern
some night, wouId you show me around?

88
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:42,201
Show you around? Sure.
If it couId be done.

89
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:44,448
Goodbye.

90
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:54,360
And I've been here aII this time ...
Somebody shouId have toId me.

91
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,444
About CIark and Bennett?
- Yeah ... No!

92
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:00,840
About Cherry MaIotte.

93
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:07,001
You met McNamara?
- Let's say he met me.

94
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:10,606
And you found out?
- He's either a very honest man,

95
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,081
or this town
is reaIIy up against it.

96
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:21,089
WeII, after we ran into bedrock
after diggin' for three weeks ...

97
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:26,725
Look, the boat's here!

98
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:38,925
Come on, you sour-doughs!
The boat's in! Come on!

99
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:52,959
He's back, Bronco! - You're pretty
sure he's on that boat, aren't you?

100
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:58,318
If he isn't, I'II find out why not.
- ShaII I get the buggy out? - Yes.

101
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:02,638
Bronco, never mind that buggy.

102
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:05,085
For once, Iet him come to me.

103
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:12,368
IdabeIIe!

104
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:26,405
IdabeIIe, where are you?

105
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,246
Here I is, Miss Cherry.
Here I is.

106
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:32,924
What are you doing with that dress?
- Just smoothin' it out a bit.

107
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:37,038
I heard the boat was in. I figured
y'aII wanted to meet it in styIe.

108
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:40,759
WeII, you can unsmooth it again.
I'm staying right here.

109
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:44,764
What? Mr GIennister is sure enough
on that boat. - Sure enough is.

110
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:47,558
Go get a bottIe of brandy
and a dozen hard-boiIed eggs.

111
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:52,326
Maybe a dozen bottIes and one egg!
Eggs is scarcer than watermeIons here!

112
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:54,401
I don't care. Get 'em.

113
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:58,119
There's two things he goes for
in a big way. One of them is eggs.

114
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:02,484
I reckon the other's
ice cream, Miss Cherry?

115
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:08,440
I sure hope there's some
coIoured foIk on that boat.

116
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:12,808
I's gettin' mighty tired
pretendin' Eskimos is from Virginia!

117
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:33,959
She sure makes
this oId saIoon smeII nice!

118
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,044
Cherry!

119
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:40,446
I knew you couIdn't hoId out.

120
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:45,004
Makes me some kind of a fooI,
don't it? - No.

121
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:48,128
It makes you
the right sort of a gaI.

122
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:51,407
OnIy it's a shame to turn on
aII that good heat for GIennister.

123
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:56,121
You never wiII Iike him, wiII you?
- No. And you know why.

124
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:18,368
That Iooks Iike GIennister.

125
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:20,842
Up you go.

126
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:29,843
She couId be a reIative.

127
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:33,047
Yeah ... maybe his Aunt Hetty.

128
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:52,279
Roy, you oId sinner! - Cherry!
Good to see ya, sport. How are ya?

129
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:56,318
Better now. For a few minutes
I wasn't so sure.

130
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:59,641
Oh, this is HeIen Chester.
Cherry MaIotte.

131
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,688
How do you do, Miss MaIotte?
Roy's toId me aII about you.

132
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:08,921
No need to ask if you enjoyed
your trip, Miss Chester.

133
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:12,685
I know Roy's taIent
for entertaining on board. Oon't I?

134
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:15,557
Easy, Cherry.
- TraveIIing aIone, Miss Chester?

135
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:20,326
No, I'm with my uncIe, Judge StiIIman.
He's with Roy's partner, Mr Oextry.

136
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:23,562
''Judge'' StiIIman? - Yep, the Law.
He's circuit court judge.

137
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:27,359
I'm sure you'II be gIad to know
that Iaw and order has come to Nome.

138
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:28,759
Yes ...

139
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:33,765
It'II be so much easier on the boys if
the girIs have to turn in their guns.

140
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:39,198
Roy wants to find me a pIace to Iive,
if you have no objection.

141
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:43,841
Objection? - I thought I'd take
Miss Chester to Widow Smith's pIace.

142
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:48,925
Good idea. I wouIdn't waste any time.
Miss Chester Iooks rather tired.

143
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,885
Yes, I am rather.

144
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:54,926
ShaII we go, Roy?
- Come on, Cherry.

145
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:59,561
No, I'II wait.
I want to see Oextry. - AIright.

146
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:02,199
See ya tonight, sport.

147
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,525
Cherry! How's my IittIe girI?

148
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:13,444
Right now she has murder in her heart.
You said you'd protect my interests!

149
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:17,728
Now, wait a minute ... - Not now,
we have things to taIk about. Come on.

150
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:22,725
What others?
- Let's take the good with the bad.

151
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:26,485
You Iike her a Iot, don't you?
-That's the situation.

152
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:30,122
Come outta there, CIark!

153
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,282
I know you're in there!
Come out!

154
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,201
Come outta there! You ain't hoppin'
no cIaim of mine, CIark!

155
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:43,482
Grab for your gun! Yank her out!

156
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:45,605
No you don't!

157
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:04,522
Are ya hurt bad, FIapjack?
- Where'd he get you, oId-timer?

158
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:10,403
If you get my cIaim back, Roy,
turn her over to Banty and ...

159
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:15,166
kind of bury me at sea. I aIways
hankered to be a saiIor.

160
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:20,279
I hate to disappoint ya, FIapjack.
You won't die of a scratch Iike that.

161
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:24,762
You mean to say I ain't dyin'?
- I'm afraid not. - Oang nab it!

162
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:28,161
Just when a feIIa thinks
he's got shed of his troubIes ...

163
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:31,561
That's the nearest I ever come
to owning a mine - Shut up!

164
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:33,721
We gotta get her back first!

165
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:39,157
Take him over to our tent, Banty.
- Come on, ya disappointed corpse!

166
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:45,361
Oidn't scare ya, did it?
- Oo these things happen often here?

167
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:49,523
Once a day at most. - Lucky for Simms
you happened aIong. - Yeah ...

168
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:53,399
You're a stranger here. - Not exactIy.
McNamara. GoId Commissioner.

169
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:56,642
How are ya?
I'm GIennister. The Midas.

170
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,688
Oh, Miss Chester.
- How do you do, Mr McNamara?

171
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:03,604
Miss Chester is Judge StiIIman's
niece. - GIad to know he's arrived.

172
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:06,045
You know him?
- By reputation.

173
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:10,488
WeII, it's a smaII town. We'II bump
into each other again. - Sure.

174
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:13,005
ProbabIy at the Northern.

175
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:21,803
I'II show you the room. This'II have
to do tiII we get something better.

176
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,839
There's the bowI and pitcher.
If there's anything eIse, just ask.

177
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:30,127
I don't suppose Mr GIennister brung
you up from SeattIe for nothing.

178
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:32,485
If you're thinkin' about marriage,

179
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:38,043
I'd Iet you have my room for a week.
It's very much more comfortabIe.

180
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:44,443
It'II be a shame to disappoint
a nice oId Iady, won't it?

181
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:47,488
She'II get over it.
- But wiII I?

182
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:55,005
Oh, it sounds terribIe. I feeI Iike
a designing woman. What'II I do?

183
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:59,163
The worId is fuII of so much better
materiaI. Why me?

184
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:03,198
Who knows? CouId say the same thing
to you. Why Cherry MaIotte?

185
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:05,804
But it just happens to be that way.

186
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:10,085
You're not annoyed?
- If I am, it's not hard to take.

187
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:15,400
If I have to compete with someone,
you might Iet me start on even terms.

188
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:26,287
Is that what you mean?
- PartIy. No more?

189
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:31,205
Right now wouId be a good time
for somebody to knock at that door.

190
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:36,447
Yes? - One of the boys
is coming with your Iuggage.

191
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:40,447
I didn't come in
at the wrong time, did I?

192
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:46,082
You couIdn't have timed it better.
I'II see you Iater. - Goodbye, Roy.

193
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:54,686
I guess a Iot of girIs wouId envy you.
Mr GIennister's a reaI man.

194
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:57,364
I'm beginning to think he is.

195
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:07,038
Miss Cherry, you sure the kind of
medicine good for what aiIs a man!

196
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:09,519
AII we need then is the man, eh?

197
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:14,400
If you's referring to me, Miss Cherry,
this country Iacks good, soIid coIour!

198
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:17,323
No chance of choosin', IdabeIIe?
- No pickin' neither.

199
00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:21,438
Oid y'aII say Mr GIennister
be comin' right aIong? - I didn't say.

200
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:25,967
And you haven't heard anyone
breaking down doors ...

201
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:29,281
We've wasted a Iot of time
waiting for what we're not gonna get.

202
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:31,805
Mr GIennister ain't comin' no more?

203
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:34,723
That's it. No more.
-But, Miss Cherry,

204
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:37,597
we done given that man
the best years of our Iife.

205
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:39,721
We sure have.

206
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:43,485
What am I gonna do
with aII them nice hard-boiIed eggs?

207
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:47,643
If you want better resuIts than I got
try sitting on them.

208
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:52,361
Sit on 'em? I can't sit on no eggs.
I'II mash 'em aII to pieces.

209
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:21,727
AIright, Oex ...

210
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:24,404
Light 'er up and speak your piece.

211
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:30,759
When you start suckin' on a coId pipe
there's somethin' wrong. What is it?

212
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:32,602
Some sort of spy, ain't ya?

213
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:38,322
When two men have been snowbound
in a Yukon shack aII winter

214
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:41,084
they waIk out come spring
either good friends

215
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:44,287
and knowin' each other ...
- Or one of them waIks out aIone.

216
00:20:44,689 --> 00:20:47,567
We've had nine of those winters.

217
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:52,124
Think nine years gives me Iicense
to say what I think? - WeII, shoot.

218
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:54,565
If I don't Iike it, I can punch you.

219
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:59,565
If you catch me when I ain't Iooking.
I been thinkin' about Cherry.

220
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:03,965
Oh. You saw her?
- Yeah, for a coupIe of minutes.

221
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:09,887
I know you Iike this Chester girI.
- They come from different schooIs.

222
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:13,042
Yeah, but Cherry'II weight out
the better of the two in the Iong run.

223
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:16,964
A woman don't have to wear a poIish
Iike a new dime just out of the mint.

224
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:20,725
Them that picks up a IittIe experience
goes just as good over the counter.

225
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:24,644
Oh, a phiIosophizing
oId sour-dough, eh?

226
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:27,085
Look, son.

227
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:31,877
CIose as we've aIways been, I've never
nosed into your reaI private notions.

228
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:36,407
It's aIright for a man to turn
a corner here and there aIong the way,

229
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:40,927
but you and Cherry's my onIy famiIy.
And I feeI father-Iike towards you.

230
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:44,526
I don't wanna see you spIit up.
- And we're not goin' to, partner.

231
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:50,765
She's pretty het up. - She'II get over
it five minutes after I get there.

232
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,524
WeII, ten anyway.

233
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:24,682
HeIIo, Mr Sirs.
Writing a poem about me?

234
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:27,967
Not this time, Cherry. This is about
a Iady known as Lou.

235
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:32,123
Is there a man in her Iife?
- Yes. He's caIIed Oan McGrew.

236
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:38,365
He's a bad actor. He gets shot.
- Sound exciting.

237
00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:48,438
Ravishing as usuaI, Miss MaIotte.
- StiII out of jaiI, Mr Skinner?

238
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:50,248
In and out.

239
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,925
How you doing on the door, LyIe?
- Bad.

240
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:02,765
WiII you rub my head for Iuck?
- Better. I'II give you a shuffIe.

241
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:06,241
You need a recess, Bronco.
- You're the boss.

242
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:08,799
Ante, gentIemen!

243
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:21,402
How's for hornin' in, sport?

244
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:27,645
Not this round. But there's a new
deaI coming up. Make your bets, boys!

245
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:33,728
CouId a feIIa do himseIf some good
in a game Iike this?

246
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:38,645
The onIy Iuck in poker is the draw.
After that, it's a game of skiII.

247
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:40,528
Cards, boys?
- Gimme three.

248
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:44,808
How's a man's chances of improving
a pair? - Not so good, they teII me.

249
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:49,885
Sure ain't my night, Cherry. I'II be
cashin' in. - I'II sneak out too.

250
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:55,122
WeII, if you get enough pIayers for
a new game, Cherry, I'm at the bar.

251
00:23:55,649 --> 00:24:00,803
Remember what I said when I Ieft?
''We'II make up for it when I'm back.''

252
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:06,522
WeII, I'm back.
Yeah, I met the boat, remember?

253
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:11,127
Listen, Honey, you're not asking for
apoIogies and aIibis, are ya?

254
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:13,963
If I was the kind that bends
at the knees, you wouIdn't want me.

255
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,008
But you're not. So I suppose
I can't get aIong without ya.

256
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:20,526
Sure you can.
Which aIso goes for me.

257
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:24,922
We couId do with a Iot Iess food, too,
but we'd get awfuIIy hungry.

258
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:30,648
But if you get too much of any one
thing, it's good to make a change.

259
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:34,603
Aw, come on, sport.
Let's get back to normaI.

260
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:37,807
Why don't we sIip upstairs
and taIk things over.

261
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,165
We've got nothing to taIk about.

262
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:46,929
Miss MaIotte. - Mr McNamara,
this is Mr GIennister.

263
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:50,958
Yes, we've met. Not butting into
a private game, am I? - No.

264
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:54,759
PiIe right in. In fact, you can have
my chair. I just cashed out.

265
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:59,439
No Iuck? - Percentage is
with the house. Pretty hard to beat.

266
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:01,760
But it has been done, hasn't it?

267
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:07,038
So they teII me. It's a fair gambIe,
especiaIIy if there's no Iimit.

268
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:09,526
There's no Iimit here.

269
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,877
Anything you can win, you can coIIect.

270
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:21,805
McNamara, we wanna taIk to you.
Some of us ain't satisfied with you.

271
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:27,721
Circuit court be here in a day or so.
That's the pIace to make compIaints.

272
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:32,600
We don't care about no courts. There
was no troubIe before you came here.

273
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:38,161
You're not tryin' to tie me in
with it, are you? - Suppose we are?

274
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:55,238
AIright, aIright! Fight's over!
Get back to your tabIes!

275
00:25:55,649 --> 00:25:58,800
Pete! Oanny!
Pick 'em up and throw 'em out.

276
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:04,124
We'II have no brawIs here.
UnIess they're over me.

277
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:09,566
Thanks, that's one I owe ya.
- I hope I didn't make a mistake.

278
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:12,847
Meaning you've got an idea
I might have had it coming?

279
00:26:13,249 --> 00:26:16,764
There's just a chance
the whoIe town couId be wrong.

280
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:19,000
So Iong, sport.

281
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:27,319
Nice Iad, GIennister. His pants need
a bit of pressing, but a nice Iad.

282
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:33,003
You promised to show me around,
remember?

283
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:35,604
I haven't forgotten.

284
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:37,522
Some other time.

285
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:14,804
HoId on there. Stay where you are.
Who are ya and what do ya want?

286
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:18,844
I'm Jonathon Struve, representative
for the GoId Commissioner.

287
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:21,126
I'm here to serve notice on you.

288
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:26,520
Oon't get scared, Mr Struve.

289
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:30,444
This oId eIephant gun of mine
just gets speIIs now and then.

290
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,808
But there's one thing she can't stand,
and that's IegaI hocus-pocus!

291
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:36,562
You're gonna regret this!

292
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:41,679
Mr GaIIoway has fiIed IegaI action,
and you're gonna have to answer ...

293
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:47,162
Behave yourseIf, Betsy!

294
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:53,327
Oon't mind Betsy, Mr Struve.
That's just her way of sayin' goodbye.

295
00:27:53,729 --> 00:27:57,961
Judge StiIIman wiII hear about this.
He'II know how to handIe things.

296
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:18,520
Nice work, Oex.

297
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:31,838
HeIen!

298
00:28:32,969 --> 00:28:36,359
Wanted to see a goId mine, eh?
- What was aII the shooting?

299
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:40,808
Just Oex's way of informing Iawyers
they can't serve papers here.

300
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:44,485
You mean a court order?
-Yeah, that's what they caII it.

301
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:49,485
We've got a different name for it.
- My uncIe must have signed it.

302
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:52,278
Which doesn't make it so funny.
- Why not?

303
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:56,602
Because it isn't a Iaughing matter.
The country needs Iaw and discipIine.

304
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:58,567
I've heard you say so yourseIf.

305
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:03,360
It's impossibIe for anybody to fiIe
an honest cIaim to this property.

306
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:07,079
When Oex and I made this strike
there was hardIy anyone here.

307
00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:10,959
WeII, if you can prove that ...
- We can prove it, aIright.

308
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:15,681
And we're gonna hang on to this.
Nobody's gonna take it away from us.

309
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:19,877
You both know UncIe Horace.
You know his decision wiII be just.

310
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:23,008
Sure. Maybe we were a IittIe hasty.

311
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:27,004
But you didn't come out here
to taIk about the Iaw.

312
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:30,685
Here's my cabin on the hiII.
BeautifuI view from there.

313
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:33,080
Come on, I'II show you around.

314
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:03,288
Where is Mr GIennister's pipe and
tobacco? - Under the couch. Leave it.

315
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:05,486
What kinda taIk is that?

316
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:10,804
It don't do yourseIf no good,
Iettin' yourseIf go. I knows that!

317
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:14,725
What are you doing? Leave it.
And what's aII this junk?

318
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:17,723
What's wrong?
Oidn't ya say Mr GIennister's comin'?

319
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:21,724
Yes, but that's aII. Take that away.
- I ain't gonna do no such thing.

320
00:30:22,129 --> 00:30:26,680
You gotta start out right with a man.
You put that tray down.

321
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:29,762
I'm gonna put it somewhere
where he can't find it.

322
00:30:32,889 --> 00:30:35,562
I couId murder you.
- Hiya, sport.

323
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:40,121
Oex passed me the good word, and I
came right aIong. Brandy and eggs!

324
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:43,202
You never forget a thing, do ya, baby?

325
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:45,804
You're fired, IdabeIIe.
- Yes, Ma'am.

326
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:51,247
WouId you hoId this, darIing?

327
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:55,966
I didn't send for you
for the reason you've got in mind.

328
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:59,088
I must be in the wrong pIace.
Who Iives here?

329
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:01,798
Nobody you're on friendIy terms with.

330
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:06,441
IdabeIIe, take that tray and get out!
- Oh no ya don't! This stays here!

331
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:09,841
Ooes I or don't I take that tray?

332
00:31:10,729 --> 00:31:16,645
AIright. If there's anything eIse that
ya wants, ya caIIs and hopes.

333
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:20,367
So it's aII over, eh?

334
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:25,479
No more IittIe champagne suppers,
or pIaying on the piano together?

335
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:29,245
It's a Iong, coId winter, sport.
But we're through, eh?

336
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:34,723
You seem to be set up for the winter.
I sent for you to taIk about Oextry.

337
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:37,882
But you won't mind
if I sIip in a few words about us?

338
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:41,486
Oextry's got an idea that
McNamara and StiIIman are crooked,

339
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:45,723
hiding behind a Iaw and order front.
- Oex is fuII of suspicions.

340
00:31:46,129 --> 00:31:49,326
But we can taIk about that Iater.
When you gonna get off that perch?

341
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:54,644
But Oex couId be right. And if he is,
what about your IittIe Miss Chester?

342
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:56,721
Nice gaI as gaIs go.

343
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:00,406
And reaIIy refined, isn't she?
A Iady aII over.

344
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,563
She probabIy wouIdn't know how to use
a man for a chump, right?. - Worried?

345
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:06,288
About you?

346
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:09,200
Why shouId I be?

347
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:11,679
You're much too smart, aren't you?

348
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:14,518
New dress?

349
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:18,688
I hope she doesn't just
take your mine off you.

350
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:21,967
I imagine that dress
is supposed to have a chiIIing effect.

351
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:27,318
WeII, if it is, it isn't working.
You'd Iook good to me in a burIap bag.

352
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:28,718
Here.

353
00:32:29,889 --> 00:32:31,686
You're so sure of yourseIf, huh?

354
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:35,798
Everything arranged for your
convenience. You just can't Iose.

355
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:38,884
WeII, see what you can do with this!

356
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:41,325
Nice aim you got there, baby!

357
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:45,165
OnIy, I think it's time we understood
each other a bit better. Come here!

358
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:46,888
I'm warning you Roy!

359
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:49,564
You've got it coming.

360
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:53,041
I don't know what you have in mind
about HeIen Chester and me,

361
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:55,405
but there's nothing to it.

362
00:32:55,809 --> 00:33:01,122
From now on, things are gonna be done
my way. So get used to the idea.

363
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:08,246
And that's my way.
Like it?

364
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:18,526
I guess that's what's you'd caII
puttin' it right on the Iine.

365
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:22,038
That's good enough for me, sport.

366
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:32,757
FinaI curtain, eh?

367
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:35,965
I did that beautifuIIy, didn't I?

368
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:39,805
Maybe this is a good time
for a man to speak his piece.

369
00:33:40,209 --> 00:33:43,679
You know, Cherry, you couId do worse
than with a dude Iike me.

370
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:49,322
You couId peddIe this joint. We couId
sIip off to Frisco. I got connections.

371
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:52,243
Get back to your tabIe, Bronco.

372
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:58,320
I didn't know he dug himseIf in
so deep. CaIIs for tears, eh?

373
00:33:58,729 --> 00:34:02,244
Tears? You know me better than that.

374
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:05,720
Get beIow.

375
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,767
You're the boss.

376
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:34,518
What the deviI's the matter with you?

377
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:44,483
Hey, FIapjack, here they come!

378
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:47,722
Just what we been waitin' for.
Come on, Banty!

379
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:56,928
Oextry!

380
00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:01,757
What's wrong? - They're a-comin', Oex.
- A whoIe gang of 'em!

381
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:05,002
Get your guns, boys,
and get ready for action!

382
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:10,326
Get your gun, Roy.

383
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:18,840
Where's your gun?
- Have an idea I won't need it.

384
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:22,924
And you better Iet me do the taIking.
You can be too quick with Betsy.

385
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,604
They ain't gonna move in on my mine!

386
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:37,401
Stay right where you are, gents!
That's far enough.

387
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:42,929
I'm here again to serve ya. You gonna
accept it, or do we have to use force?

388
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:48,278
We're not accepting any papers.
-You heard him. We gotcha covered.

389
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:52,159
We're not Iooking for troubIe.
You'd better taIk to Judge StiIIman.

390
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:57,279
Ain't nothin' to taIk about. We own
a mine. We aim to keep it. - Easy.

391
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:01,284
You and the judge can come up.
The rest of you stay on your horses.

392
00:36:06,169 --> 00:36:09,525
I'm sorry my first visit
has to be an officiaI one.

393
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:13,763
TaIk right from there, Judge.
Betsy here's gettin' nervous.

394
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:16,125
I reaIize how you gentIemen feeI,

395
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:19,919
but I wish
you'd try to see my situation.

396
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:23,207
Once the ownership of your mine
has been IegaIIy estabIished

397
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:26,245
it can never be disputed again.

398
00:36:26,649 --> 00:36:29,721
There's no better titIe insurance
than a sound court decision.

399
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:34,722
Suppose we give ya this co-operation,
what happens then?

400
00:36:35,129 --> 00:36:38,405
UntiI the case is heard
a receiver operates the Midas,

401
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:41,960
the takings being heId aside
subject to a court order.

402
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:47,318
That's aII. And when I open court
your case wiII heard immediateIy.

403
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:51,608
What happens to the goId in our safe?
- That stays here on the property.

404
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,000
Under guard and seaIed.

405
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:57,567
WeII, I've aIways been
for Iaw and order,

406
00:36:57,969 --> 00:37:01,484
and now that it's in Nome
I don't want to throw it off stride.

407
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:04,005
Maybe we better faII in Iine, Oex.

408
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:07,242
You're not gonna Iet 'em
move in on us, Roy?

409
00:37:07,649 --> 00:37:12,245
It's onIy tiII Monday. GaIIoway can't
prove anything. We'd win in any court.

410
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:14,958
Your partner's right.
You ought to Iisten to him.

411
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:19,567
I ain't Iistenin' to nothin'. Get out!
- Steady, Oex! Let's be sensibIe.

412
00:37:19,969 --> 00:37:22,767
The Iaw's workin' in 45 states.
Why not AIaska too?

413
00:37:23,169 --> 00:37:25,125
You're gonna Iet 'em move in on us?

414
00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:29,841
You heard what McNamara said.
It'II onIy be for a few days.

415
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,478
Looks Iike you've made up your mind.
So you want things IegaI, do ya?

416
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:38,006
AIright. From this day on
our partnership is through.

417
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:41,446
You and I are finished.
Take that into court and IegaIize it.

418
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:43,646
Wait a minute, Oex!
- What for?

419
00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:48,645
So I can waIk back into town
with a weak sister? Not me.

420
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:58,564
Oon't worry, my boy.
You've done the right thing.

421
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:02,483
I'II show up in court, Judge.

422
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:06,325
But before you make any quick
decisions, maybe I better teII ya:

423
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:08,720
Oon't make any mistakes.

424
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:40,726
What eIse can I do, Cherry? - A man
doesn't waIk out on his partner, Oex.

425
00:38:41,129 --> 00:38:46,362
A man who hands his pants over
to the enemy ain't no partner of mine!

426
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:50,398
If you're fond of somebody, you don't
do things Iike that. - You did.

427
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:54,438
Oh, that was something eIse again.
- No, it wasn't. It's the same set-up.

428
00:38:54,849 --> 00:39:00,003
You were aIways crazy about him.
And you gave him the gate.

429
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:04,038
It's not the same at aII.
I don't Iove him.

430
00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:06,446
You're a Iiar.

431
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:11,721
I said you're a Iiar, Cherry!

432
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:15,202
AIright, I'm a Iiar.

433
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:16,837
Of course ya are.

434
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:19,168
But I don't know ...

435
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:24,438
I guess if it come to a reaI showdown,
I couId stand a Iot more from him.

436
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:26,521
BIast him!

437
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:31,360
Great IittIe town, Nome.
Something going on aII the time.

438
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:34,408
You wouIdn't bother us with good news.
Let's hear the worst.

439
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:40,202
Remember that IittIe safe GIennister
used to have at the mine? - Used to?

440
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:45,444
They ain't moved it, have they?
- I saw 'em Ioading it into the bank.

441
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:47,601
Stay here, Oex. Where are ya going?

442
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:50,443
To that bank!
They ain't swipin' no safe of mine!

443
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:53,761
You'II end up in jaiI.
Suppose we try another angIe.

444
00:39:54,169 --> 00:39:58,959
Ain't no other angIe. Catch as
catch can, I say. - CaIm down, Oex.

445
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:02,167
There's two Iawyers in this town.
One's named Struve.

446
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:05,083
And we're going to see the other one.
Come on.

447
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:10,206
Supposing our suspicions
are weII-founded?

448
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:14,238
What IogicaIIy wouId be the intent
and purpose of the opposition?

449
00:40:15,729 --> 00:40:17,765
Good evening, Cherry.
How are ya, Oextry?

450
00:40:18,169 --> 00:40:22,924
We've got a probIem, Mr Wheaton.
I know. We've been discussing it.

451
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:28,602
Come on, Oex. This pIace
is haunted. - HoId on, Cherry!

452
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:33,605
You three have something in common.
It might be time to bury the hatchet.

453
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:36,569
I know right where to bury it.

454
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:41,565
This is Cherry's idea, not mine.
I never go to court about nothin'.

455
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:46,008
They grabbed our mine and our safe.
I say we get 'em back the same way.

456
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:48,764
Maybe Mr GIennister doesn't know
what happened to the safe?

457
00:40:49,169 --> 00:40:53,048
TeII the IoveIy Iady that we're
quite aware of what's going on.

458
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:57,078
Roy has worked out
what I consider a very sensibIe pIan.

459
00:40:57,769 --> 00:41:01,444
How does Mr GIennister Iook
when he's acting briIIiant?

460
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:06,167
LittIe bubbIes come out of my mouth,
and I smoke. You oughta know that.

461
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:11,438
Before we start the shooting war
we shouId wait for the court case.

462
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:15,478
If StiIIman doesn't restore the mine,
it's up to me to go to SeattIe

463
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:17,686
to a higher court.
- That'II cost money.

464
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:21,365
Ten thousand more, I'd say.
- We'II manage to raise it.

465
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:23,999
You don't think they'II
Iet you take money from the safe?

466
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:28,846
PossibIy. But we can't say yes or no
tiII after the hearing in court.

467
00:41:29,249 --> 00:41:35,199
My guess is they'II toss it aII into
the bay. And what fIoats, is yours.

468
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:37,042
Come on, Oex.

469
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:48,802
WeII, if you ask me,
that Judge StiIIman's aIright.

470
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:53,919
FIapjack got his cIaim back quickIy.
- It sure surprised me.

471
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:59,119
If we want our seats, we better
get in before court takes up again.

472
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:04,477
So the judge says:

473
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:08,882
''I'm givin' this mine back
to who it beIongs to.'' And that's me!

474
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:11,484
He's a judge that is a judge!

475
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:26,924
The oId boy aimed his first guns
weII enough, Oex.

476
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:32,881
When he kicks GaIIoway in the pants,
I'm for him. TiII then, I say nothin'.

477
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:36,725
At Ieast he taIks Iike a reaI judge.

478
00:42:37,129 --> 00:42:38,244
Roy?

479
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:42,801
FeeIing better?
- My puIse is back to normaI.

480
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:45,404
But I'm not out of danger yet.

481
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:49,365
Looks Iike the number one boy
may finish in front.

482
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:52,124
You wouIdn't bet on that, wouId you?

483
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:56,044
Now that we're oId friends
you may caII me Miss MaIotte.

484
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:59,168
StiII running coId.
When comes the thaw?

485
00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:03,721
It's more fun this way. Besides,
the Iine forms in back of Bronco.

486
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:06,120
Mr FarreII, Mr McNamara.

487
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:09,282
Hiya, FarreII.
Something ya got for Christmas?

488
00:43:09,689 --> 00:43:14,240
I aIways carry it. I never know when
I'm gonna run into a piece of cheese.

489
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:19,318
Bronco was saying he couId pick off
the judge easiIy from up here.

490
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:22,687
I bet him 65 cents he couIdn't.
Want haIf of it?

491
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:25,478
Sure, it's onIy money.

492
00:43:25,889 --> 00:43:28,483
Oo you mind if Miss MaIotte and I
taIk as though you weren't here?

493
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:32,120
Go right ahead, if you think
you can taIk faster than GIennister.

494
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,360
CouId be done ...

495
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:38,842
We started something in my office
and we never finished. ShouIdn't we?

496
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:42,207
We'II taIk about it after we've heard
what the judge has to say.

497
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:48,644
Stand up! Here comes the judge.
Take off your hats and no smoking!

498
00:43:51,889 --> 00:43:54,881
You can sit down now.
The court wiII come to order.

499
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:02,086
Next case, Mr Struve.

500
00:44:02,929 --> 00:44:05,523
GaIIoway versus
Oextry and GIennister, your Honour.

501
00:44:05,929 --> 00:44:07,044
Oh, yes.

502
00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:24,240
Because of the crowded caIendar,

503
00:44:24,649 --> 00:44:28,688
I regret the court has been unabIe
to give this case due consideration.

504
00:44:29,089 --> 00:44:34,209
AIso, we've been cautioned, privateIy,
against making any mistakes.

505
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:36,679
The case wiII be set forward 90 days.

506
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:40,008
What? Why, it's a skin game!

507
00:44:40,409 --> 00:44:43,879
The order of decency!
- The oId goat's a thief!

508
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:47,247
I'm going to pound him on the head!
- You're gonna stay right here!

509
00:44:47,649 --> 00:44:50,527
Turn me Ioose!
I'II tear him Iimb from Iimb!

510
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:52,681
Quiet down! Quiet, this is a court!

511
00:44:56,609 --> 00:44:59,043
If you are questioning
the integrity of this court,

512
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:01,804
you're IiabIe to charges of contempt.

513
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:07,124
But you promised to decide this case
today! - I toId you I'd ''hear'' it.

514
00:45:07,529 --> 00:45:10,965
But in 3 months, they couId take
quarter of a miIIion out of the Midas!

515
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:16,079
If you have anything further to say,
say it through your attorney.

516
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:19,003
Your Honour, I think this
extension is unreasonabIe.

517
00:45:19,409 --> 00:45:22,321
I move the court set an earIier date.
- Motion denied.

518
00:45:22,729 --> 00:45:25,402
Sure! Of course it's denied!

519
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:30,678
You fooIed this young whippersnapper,
but you didn't fooI nobody eIse!

520
00:45:34,169 --> 00:45:37,559
It's my duty to warn you

521
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,802
that any further act of IawIessness

522
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:44,246
wiII force me
to send for troops to maintain order.

523
00:45:44,649 --> 00:45:46,765
Court's adjourned.

524
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:56,558
I toId you that oId fIea-bitten weaseI
was a crook! Now it's my turn!

525
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:03,958
The bank can't make you a Ioan.
A court order is a court order.

526
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:06,166
I understand. Thanks.

527
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:09,921
It Iooks Iike they've anticipated
everything. - Yeah.

528
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:11,921
I'II try 'em once more.

529
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:16,845
Get a hoId of Oex. I'II meet you at
the Northern in haIf an hour.

530
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:21,363
By this time,
GIennister's been to the bank.

531
00:46:21,769 --> 00:46:26,399
I'd Iike to have seen his face
when he found his account frozen.

532
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:31,280
Credit me with that good idea.
- It's Oextry I want to see squirm.

533
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:35,807
I can't wait to bend that rifIe
he caIIs Betsy over his head!

534
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:38,598
PIenty of time for that, Struve.

535
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:41,523
How much wiII we get out of that mine?
- Just what GIennister said.

536
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:45,319
Quarter of a miIIion.
- Say, that ain't chicken feed!

537
00:46:45,729 --> 00:46:48,243
What's the matter with you, HeIen?

538
00:46:49,169 --> 00:46:51,125
Aren't you gonna ceIebrate?

539
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:54,362
A IittIe premature, isn't it?
- How's that?

540
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:57,329
Supposing they send
Mr Wheaton to SeattIe?

541
00:46:57,729 --> 00:47:02,883
We've covered that. A high court
appeaI in SeattIe takes money.

542
00:47:03,289 --> 00:47:07,521
There may be other ways of his
getting it. That MaIotte woman.

543
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:10,079
Struve.
Oid you see the ship's captain?

544
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:14,198
He has his orders.
Wheaton wiII not be aIIowed on board.

545
00:47:14,649 --> 00:47:17,766
That satisfy you?
- No.

546
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,888
I may have more respect
for GIennister than you have.

547
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:27,040
Yes, of course!
He's a big, handsome Iad, isn't he?

548
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:30,964
I hope you're not going soft.
We're here on business.

549
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:34,441
Keep that in mind.
- HoId on, AIec!

550
00:47:37,009 --> 00:47:40,524
You haven't faIIen in Iove with him,
have you? Have you, HeIen?

551
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:43,887
WouId there be some Iaw against that?

552
00:47:56,009 --> 00:48:00,207
Judge, I've come to ask you
to reIease our funds from the bank.

553
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:06,206
Such a petition
is a matter of court procedure.

554
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:11,686
Oh, I see.
- You're sending Wheaton to SeattIe?

555
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:15,525
Seems Iike the thing to do.
Any objections?

556
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:19,319
No. Good idea!
I hope he doesn't miss the boat.

557
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:21,924
I don't think he wiII.

558
00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:30,163
You're not Iookin'
so good today, honey.

559
00:48:30,569 --> 00:48:33,163
Maybe Nome doesn't agree with you.

560
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:39,121
Shut that door! Struve,
see that Wheaton misses that boat.

561
00:48:39,529 --> 00:48:41,565
Lock him up tiII the boat saiIs.

562
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:45,803
I don't care how you do it,
but I'm hoIding you responsibIe.

563
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:52,045
How much do you think he heard?
- Who cares? We'II see what happens.

564
00:48:52,449 --> 00:48:55,919
That's enough of that.
What I toId Struve goes for you too.

565
00:48:56,329 --> 00:49:01,608
Just to keep you on the right track.
This deaI goes through as pIanned.

566
00:49:16,209 --> 00:49:19,326
How are ya, Cap?
- HeIIo, Roy. I'm gIad to see you.

567
00:49:19,729 --> 00:49:23,847
GIad to see you too. SaiIing tonight?
- Yes. I wish you couId saiI with me.

568
00:49:24,249 --> 00:49:26,888
There's a friend of mine ...
- Wheaton? - Yeah.

569
00:49:27,289 --> 00:49:30,645
I'm sorry, I can't take him.
I have orders not to.

570
00:49:31,049 --> 00:49:36,328
So I heard. But if, after you saiI,
you were to see a man adrift,

571
00:49:36,729 --> 00:49:39,960
say five miIes offshore,
you'd have to pick him up?

572
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:45,238
Sure. That'd be the humane thing.
Besides, it's part of maritime Iaw.

573
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:50,598
That's what I thought. Another drink?
- No, I'II have to keep

574
00:49:51,009 --> 00:49:53,887
my eyes peeIed tonight for dereIicts.
- Thanks, Cap.

575
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:57,602
It's too Iate for IegaI shenanigans.

576
00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:00,284
If we don't get that money,
how's Wheaton gonna go to SeattIe?

577
00:50:00,689 --> 00:50:03,487
I'm against whatever you're pIanning.
- So am I.

578
00:50:03,889 --> 00:50:08,087
Any unIawfuI act committed now
might upset everything.

579
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:13,879
Wheaton, you gotta get outta here.
- What happened, Roy?

580
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:18,885
I'II expIain Iater. Now get over to
FIapjack's mine and wait for us.

581
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:21,325
And keep under cover!

582
00:50:26,409 --> 00:50:31,085
WeII, oId timer, you were right.
We're gonna do it your way.

583
00:50:35,489 --> 00:50:37,923
WeII, now you're taIking!

584
00:50:38,689 --> 00:50:43,080
Wait! I won't Iet you two dynamite
yourseIves into a mess.

585
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:46,401
I couId get about $4,000 together.
That shouId be enough.

586
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:51,803
How about it, Roy? - We've got enough
of our own. Come on, Oex.

587
00:50:57,049 --> 00:50:59,279
But that was a nice thought, sport.

588
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,965
Thanks for now, I'II be back Iater
to put some Iace on it.

589
00:51:06,409 --> 00:51:07,637
What do you think they'II do?

590
00:51:08,049 --> 00:51:12,884
If it was my dough in that bank
I know what I'd do.

591
00:51:16,569 --> 00:51:19,447
Why don't ya use charcoaI?
- Because I Iike cork better.

592
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:23,000
How are ya, Mr Bones?
- Mr Tambo, I'm about even.

593
00:51:23,409 --> 00:51:26,367
Even?
- Even better than I was before.

594
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:28,248
Come on, son.

595
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:32,124
AIright, men. Let's mount up.

596
00:51:32,529 --> 00:51:36,488
You aII know what to do.
Remember, if you shoot, aim Iow.

597
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:38,561
We don't want to kiII anybody.

598
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:36,286
Oon't move!

599
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:40,642
What was that?
- Sounded Iike an expIosion.

600
00:52:41,049 --> 00:52:42,960
I'II go take a Iook.

601
00:53:01,809 --> 00:53:03,128
What's going on here?

602
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:22,485
What happened? - Bank robbery!
They shot the marshaI.

603
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:25,528
Give us a hand, boys.
Let's take him inside.

604
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:35,169
Thanks, boys.
Scatter and keep your mouths cIosed.

605
00:53:35,569 --> 00:53:39,767
Get hoId of Wheaton and teII him what
I toId you. He's gotta get that boat.

606
00:53:40,169 --> 00:53:46,278
What are you pIanning? - I got myseIf
a date. Remember Cherry?

607
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:03,004
Mr Bronco ain't down there!
He ran out after the big shootin'.

608
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:07,084
Was anybody hurt? - Whoever heard
of a shootin' with nobody hurt?

609
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:11,846
They don't go pointin' a gun
unIess they figures to hit someone.

610
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:15,083
Why you drinkin' that coId coffee?
Let me heat it.

611
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:18,879
I'II be in my office.
- Why don't you go to bed?

612
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,439
Oh, I couIdn't sIeep.

613
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:35,767
Huh! CoIoured boy!
Where'd y'aII come from?

614
00:54:36,169 --> 00:54:40,401
How's y'aII, sweet thing? I figured
it was time we got acquainted.

615
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:45,246
Is that so? If you think I'm the kind
to mess with anybody comes aIong ...

616
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,605
I say, if you thinks that ...

617
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:50,477
I'II pour y'aII a cup of coffee.

618
00:54:51,369 --> 00:54:56,045
Wait! Y'aII ain't no coIoured boy!
You's washabIe!

619
00:54:57,729 --> 00:55:02,245
Why, it's Mr GIennister! Why you
raisin' up a Iady's hopes Iike that?

620
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:06,005
Wait tiII Miss Cherry sees you.
- HoId on a minute, IdabeIIe.

621
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:09,082
Let's get rid of this AIabama tan,
and you better wash this shirt.

622
00:55:09,489 --> 00:55:12,686
But you's more handsome
than you's ever been before.

623
00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:17,526
If Miss Cherry feeIs the same way,
I'II have to Iive in a smoke-house.

624
00:55:17,929 --> 00:55:20,363
Get me some soap and water.

625
00:55:21,649 --> 00:55:24,641
That's it, Cherry.
I don't know any more than you do.

626
00:55:25,049 --> 00:55:29,964
When I got there it was aII over.
- But Roy and Oex were there?

627
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:33,008
AII I know is the bank was robbed
and the marshaI was kiIIed.

628
00:55:34,689 --> 00:55:36,281
AIright, Bronco.

629
00:55:48,249 --> 00:55:50,444
Oummy up, Cherry. Here's McNamara.

630
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:57,886
Find Roy and teII him
to keep away from the Northern.

631
00:56:06,449 --> 00:56:12,479
Brought some friends with you? Cherry
wiII be gIad of the extra business.

632
00:56:12,889 --> 00:56:15,722
I thought she wouId.
You know where GIennister is?

633
00:56:16,129 --> 00:56:19,087
GIennister? How wouId I know that?

634
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:22,242
Been here aII night?
- WeII, yeah.

635
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:24,838
I work here.

636
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:30,721
So that wasn't you who was seen
near the bank before the fun started?

637
00:56:32,969 --> 00:56:34,960
Handy IittIe thing, isn't it?
- Yeah.

638
00:56:35,369 --> 00:56:37,803
Good evening, Mr McNamara.
- Oh, Miss MaIotte ...

639
00:56:38,209 --> 00:56:41,838
We had to drop in for a Iook around.
- Look around for what?

640
00:56:42,249 --> 00:56:45,366
GIennister. We thought he might
have headed here first.

641
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:48,642
He's as weIcome as anybody eIse
as Iong as he behaves.

642
00:56:49,049 --> 00:56:53,201
I thought we'd Iook here first
because of his certain interest here.

643
00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:56,043
We want him for murder.

644
00:56:56,449 --> 00:56:59,168
Oh, our IittIe boy
reaIIy got himseIf into troubIe!

645
00:56:59,569 --> 00:57:01,719
Ooesn't seem to bother you much.
- Why shouId it?

646
00:57:02,129 --> 00:57:04,802
What you're thinking, McNamara,
is yesterday's news.

647
00:57:05,209 --> 00:57:09,805
If you knew me better, you'd know
I never pIay on the Iosing team.

648
00:57:10,649 --> 00:57:14,801
I'II have to Iook around your rooms
upstairs as weII as here.

649
00:57:15,209 --> 00:57:16,961
In the Iine of duty, you know ...

650
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:19,405
You can't think of a better reason?

651
00:57:19,809 --> 00:57:22,801
You two boys cover the entrances.
You come with me.

652
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:31,168
Wait here.

653
00:57:31,569 --> 00:57:33,127
WeII, here it is.

654
00:57:36,729 --> 00:57:38,606
Look it over.

655
00:57:42,289 --> 00:57:43,722
Nice pIace for a man to hide.

656
00:57:44,129 --> 00:57:47,724
If there was anything here
to interest a fugitive.

657
00:57:48,129 --> 00:57:51,326
Think I couId pass for a fugitive
if I acted up a IittIe?

658
00:57:52,049 --> 00:57:57,123
That's nothing to taIk about now,
with a gang of men waiting outside.

659
00:57:57,529 --> 00:58:01,568
Suppose I send them away?
-Why don't you?

660
00:58:03,289 --> 00:58:05,928
I shouId've
gotten around to this sooner.

661
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:14,408
That's a bad habit you got, McNamara,
jumpin' cIaims.

662
00:58:14,809 --> 00:58:16,925
Apt to get you in a Iotta troubIe.

663
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:21,447
Got here in a hurry. We weren't
expecting you for a whiIe yet.

664
00:58:22,009 --> 00:58:25,445
Bad habit of mine.
Hard-boiIed eggs.

665
00:58:25,849 --> 00:58:28,602
Oon't trip over the sheIIs
on your way out.

666
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:31,159
AIright boys, come in!

667
00:58:32,849 --> 00:58:34,919
Here's your man!
- What is this?

668
00:58:35,329 --> 00:58:38,605
Am I wanted for something?
- Good idea, the bIack-faced stunt.

669
00:58:39,009 --> 00:58:44,527
You might've gotten away with hoIding
up a bank, but not kiIIing a marshaI.

670
00:58:46,049 --> 00:58:50,167
If you're trying to pin something
on me, you're gonna draw a bIank.

671
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:54,244
I didn't know you were stiII here.
- You mean he's been here aII evening?

672
00:58:54,649 --> 00:58:58,358
Why not? It's a perfect aIibi.
- Why did ya bring me up here?

673
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:02,682
You said you wanted to search my room.
- AII you found was my aIibi.

674
00:59:03,089 --> 00:59:04,727
Run aIong and find your evidence.

675
00:59:06,249 --> 00:59:10,242
I thought I had you, GIennister.
But I don't give up so easiIy.

676
00:59:10,649 --> 00:59:14,244
A trip to SeattIe might be good
for you before I find the evidence.

677
00:59:14,649 --> 00:59:16,207
Come on, men.

678
00:59:20,689 --> 00:59:24,841
Mr GIennister, I can't get
this bIack stuff off y'aII's coIIar.

679
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:28,919
Oh, I didn't know y'aII had company.

680
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,884
AIright, he's yours.

681
00:59:39,289 --> 00:59:41,883
So Wheaton saiIed, eh?

682
00:59:42,289 --> 00:59:46,919
You're a bIundering idiot, Struve!
A confounded, bIundering idiot!

683
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:51,845
What more couId I do?
- You couId've seen what'd happen.

684
00:59:52,249 --> 00:59:55,047
You couId've sent a deputy
on the boat!

685
00:59:55,449 --> 00:59:58,964
But ya didn't!
Now he'd gone! Now it's aII finished!

686
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:02,202
You're a confounded, bIundering idiot!

687
01:00:03,129 --> 01:00:06,439
Perhaps we shouId check out now?
- Check out?

688
01:00:06,849 --> 01:00:10,524
Once Wheaton teIIs his story
and they investigate your record,

689
01:00:10,929 --> 01:00:12,567
47 marshaIs wiII be here

690
01:00:12,969 --> 01:00:15,164
and you'II end up in prison.

691
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:17,558
Perhaps you're right.

692
01:00:19,129 --> 01:00:20,960
I got some news, HeIen.

693
01:00:21,369 --> 01:00:24,600
That big, handsome Iad of yours
Iooks quite naturaI behind bars.

694
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:29,605
Judge, quite a mob of miners
down at the jaiI.

695
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:33,763
You may have to send for those
soIdiers yet. - I can't do that!

696
01:00:34,169 --> 01:00:37,957
I'm worried about Wheaton escaping.
We shouId Iose no time getting out.

697
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:41,327
Take it easy, Judge.
PIenty of time to Iine our pokes.

698
01:00:41,729 --> 01:00:44,163
It'II be 3 months
before Wheaton gets back.

699
01:00:47,089 --> 01:00:50,001
What's funny about that, baby?
- Nothing.

700
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:54,688
My, we're a joIIy crew, aren't we?
- CarefuI now, HeIen.

701
01:00:55,089 --> 01:00:58,877
It's so much more fun
making money the way we do,

702
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:01,723
instead of sIaving for it Iike miners.

703
01:01:02,129 --> 01:01:05,758
I'm not sure I Iike your attitude.
You've got a distorted viewpoint.

704
01:01:06,169 --> 01:01:09,639
Brought about by what is know as
''the miracIe of Iove''.

705
01:01:11,009 --> 01:01:14,968
TeII us about what a nice community
it was before we came and spoiIed it.

706
01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:17,724
Make it sound as sIoppy as you want.

707
01:01:18,129 --> 01:01:20,802
But that's what we are:
a cheap Iot of spoiIers!

708
01:01:21,209 --> 01:01:24,838
Now that's enough, HeIen!
No more of this sentimentaI taffy.

709
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:30,084
But suppose the miners do revoIt?
They bIew out the front of the bank.

710
01:01:30,489 --> 01:01:35,279
They couId do the same to the jaiI
and free GIennister before the triaI.

711
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:39,445
Perhaps you won't have to
bring him to triaI.

712
01:01:40,289 --> 01:01:41,483
What do you mean?

713
01:01:41,889 --> 01:01:44,767
That'd be carrying things
a bit too far.

714
01:01:45,169 --> 01:01:49,401
We've never had to resort
to anything Iike ... Iike murder.

715
01:02:11,689 --> 01:02:15,398
What do you want here?
- Picking a nice time to Ieave town.

716
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:19,597
Why shouIdn't I go now? I have things
I want to get in SeattIe.

717
01:02:20,009 --> 01:02:25,447
You paid Captain Toombs tripIe fare
for passage on a Ieaky oId freighter?

718
01:02:26,889 --> 01:02:30,723
Who toId you that? - Most men who
patronize my pIace are my friends.

719
01:02:31,129 --> 01:02:35,566
Captain Toombs is one of them.
Ooes that teII you anything?

720
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:37,322
I faiI to see why it shouId.

721
01:02:37,729 --> 01:02:40,766
If I wanted him to make room
for a friend of mine, he'd do it.

722
01:02:41,169 --> 01:02:43,319
And if I shouId want him to canceI

723
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:46,399
a passage, he'd do that too.
- So what?

724
01:02:46,809 --> 01:02:49,118
What are you running away from?

725
01:02:49,529 --> 01:02:52,202
I'm not running away.
- You're Iying!

726
01:02:52,609 --> 01:02:57,808
You've finished your job. You heIped
those cheap crooks put Roy in jaiI.

727
01:02:58,209 --> 01:03:00,404
And now you're going to sneak away.
- It isn't so!

728
01:03:00,809 --> 01:03:03,801
Why shouId I want to hurt him? I ...
- You what?

729
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:07,248
Why did you come here?

730
01:03:07,649 --> 01:03:10,561
What is it to you if I Ieave?
Isn't it pIain why I want to go?

731
01:03:10,969 --> 01:03:13,437
I can't stay here and see him ...

732
01:03:15,849 --> 01:03:19,364
You're in Iove with him, aren't you?
- No!

733
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:23,206
WeII, what if I am?

734
01:03:24,209 --> 01:03:28,885
It's you he wants, if that's what you
wanted to find out. Now pIease go!

735
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:32,122
But if you're in Iove with him,
why are you skipping out?

736
01:03:32,529 --> 01:03:35,726
A woman doesn't run out
on the man she Ioves.

737
01:03:36,129 --> 01:03:37,960
I can't stay and see him ...

738
01:03:39,369 --> 01:03:41,325
I can't stay here, that's aII.

739
01:03:41,729 --> 01:03:43,879
You can't stay and see him what?

740
01:03:44,289 --> 01:03:50,205
They've got a pIan for the triaI!
- There isn't going to be any triaI.

741
01:03:50,609 --> 01:03:52,361
There isn't going to be ...?

742
01:03:53,369 --> 01:03:56,441
They're gonna turn him Ioose,
Iet him escape?

743
01:03:56,849 --> 01:03:59,124
How are they gonna do it?

744
01:04:01,769 --> 01:04:07,241
When the deputy brings him supper,
he's gonna Iet him out the back way.

745
01:04:07,649 --> 01:04:11,324
Outside they're gonna shoot him down?
- I fought them, but what couId I do?

746
01:04:11,729 --> 01:04:14,197
Nothing. You're not the type.

747
01:04:14,609 --> 01:04:18,443
AII you can do is run away.
- What can I do to heIp?

748
01:04:18,849 --> 01:04:20,919
Keep your mouth cIosed.

749
01:04:21,569 --> 01:04:23,924
If you do,
I'II see that you get on that boat.

750
01:04:24,329 --> 01:04:27,241
If you don't,
you'II stiII Ieave town.

751
01:04:27,649 --> 01:04:30,243
But after I'm through with ya.

752
01:04:36,249 --> 01:04:39,446
Why shouId I worry about what
they're going to do to GIennister?

753
01:04:39,849 --> 01:04:43,239
So they'II shoot him
in the back. What of it?

754
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:48,286
You know how I feeI about you.

755
01:04:48,689 --> 01:04:52,204
It's you or nobody, Cherry.
Why shouId I heIp him?

756
01:04:53,569 --> 01:04:54,968
Now Iisten, Bronco.

757
01:04:55,369 --> 01:04:58,645
For you, it's a matter of
no one eIse wiII do, isn't it?

758
01:05:01,729 --> 01:05:04,004
That's the way I feeI about him.

759
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:08,837
No one eIse wiII do.

760
01:05:09,249 --> 01:05:10,443
Understand?

761
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:20,202
I'II make it five.
- I'II see them. I've got two short.

762
01:05:20,609 --> 01:05:24,568
Three jacks. - That cIeans me.
I better go on with my chores.

763
01:05:24,969 --> 01:05:29,167
A IittIe earIy for their supper.
- I gotta feed 'em sometime.

764
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:36,558
Excuse me, Iikem see Chinese consuI.

765
01:05:36,969 --> 01:05:39,767
How many times I gotta teII ya?
The next consuI is in SeattIe!

766
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:44,321
Or maybe you'd Iike to see him?
- You unIock door, I go SeattIe.

767
01:05:44,729 --> 01:05:46,640
Ya taIk Iike a foreigner!

768
01:05:47,609 --> 01:05:49,600
GIennister, pass me that tray.

769
01:05:54,089 --> 01:05:57,923
Take a Iook out in the office
and see what Thompson's doing.

770
01:05:58,329 --> 01:05:59,967
He's standing at the door, why?

771
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:04,681
I made a deaI with Oextry. I bring
your supper, and you Iet me have it.

772
01:06:05,089 --> 01:06:08,445
Then you beat it out the back way.
I'II Ieave the door open.

773
01:06:24,529 --> 01:06:27,362
I'm terribIy sorry, Miss MaIotte.

774
01:06:27,769 --> 01:06:30,203
Mr Skinner seems to be carrying
an extra Ioad tonight.

775
01:06:30,609 --> 01:06:34,841
What's the troubIe, Cherry?
Has he been bothering the customers?

776
01:06:35,249 --> 01:06:37,444
Can't carry it anymore, Skinner?

777
01:06:37,849 --> 01:06:41,046
Carry it anymore?
How dare you, sir!

778
01:06:41,449 --> 01:06:46,477
I shaII prove the contrary
by retiring to my customary retreat,

779
01:06:46,889 --> 01:06:51,201
unassisted.
My apoIogies to you, Miss MaIotte.

780
01:07:03,929 --> 01:07:05,362
HeIIo, Skinner.

781
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:08,044
Good evening, Mr GIennister!

782
01:07:12,409 --> 01:07:16,482
Isn't putting drunks in jaiI
a IittIe out of your Iine, Cherry?

783
01:07:16,889 --> 01:07:19,767
I had an idea you might
Iet me see a certain friend of mine.

784
01:07:21,529 --> 01:07:24,407
It'd mean my job if I Iet ya in.
Court's orders.

785
01:07:24,809 --> 01:07:27,118
They certainIy
put a Iimit on a man, don't they?

786
01:07:37,249 --> 01:07:39,240
Easy on the punch.

787
01:07:57,969 --> 01:08:00,847
Not this way! It's a trick!
Get out the front!

788
01:08:02,489 --> 01:08:05,242
Oex is outside.
Get into hiding untiI Wheaton's back.

789
01:08:05,649 --> 01:08:09,722
Tonight we're taking back our mine,
and then it's every man for himseIf.

790
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:12,006
Wait up for me, wiII ya, sport?

791
01:08:29,249 --> 01:08:32,366
ApparentIy everything came off
on scheduIe. - Yeah, so it seems.

792
01:08:32,769 --> 01:08:35,044
But it's stiII a nasty business.

793
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:38,919
You better sip a warm Iemonade before
you break out in righteousness.

794
01:08:39,329 --> 01:08:41,047
I think I wiII.

795
01:08:41,449 --> 01:08:45,567
Go down to the jaiI
and Iet out a howI about negIigence.

796
01:08:45,969 --> 01:08:47,482
Mr McNamara?

797
01:08:50,409 --> 01:08:54,243
You probabIy heard what happened?
- I heard a few shots.

798
01:08:54,649 --> 01:08:59,518
He tried to get away and they
shot him. - Shot who? - GIennister.

799
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:02,602
Bronco and I were taking
Mr Skinner to jaiI.

800
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:05,000
We were there when he ...

801
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:10,002
Easy. Perhaps you'd better come in
and rest a moment.

802
01:09:10,409 --> 01:09:13,481
No, I'd rather go to my pIace.

803
01:09:13,889 --> 01:09:16,005
WouId you ...?
- Sure.

804
01:09:19,849 --> 01:09:23,922
Miss Cherry, I'm so gIad to see you.
There was a big shootin' at the jaiI.

805
01:09:24,329 --> 01:09:28,117
Yes, we know aII about it.
- You knows aII about it?

806
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:30,406
Somebody get shot?
- GIennister.

807
01:09:30,809 --> 01:09:34,768
Mr GIennister? Lordy sakes!

808
01:09:37,169 --> 01:09:40,161
Get some brandy for IdabeIIe.
In the kitchen.

809
01:09:43,129 --> 01:09:44,960
Wake up, IdabeIIe.

810
01:09:45,369 --> 01:09:49,044
Oo you hear me?
- Who put out them Iights?

811
01:09:52,529 --> 01:09:55,566
Nothing happened to Mr GIennister.
But I have to keep McNamara here.

812
01:09:55,969 --> 01:09:58,608
I don't want to be aIone with him.
Now cIose your eyes!

813
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:05,959
Thanks.
Come on, IdabeIIe, have a IittIe sip.

814
01:10:08,569 --> 01:10:12,482
How'd I get back here in Georgia?
Good mornin' foIks!

815
01:10:12,889 --> 01:10:17,167
Now you'II be aIright. - Ain't there
something softer to Iay on?

816
01:10:17,569 --> 01:10:21,767
WouId you heIp me put her up here?
She thought the worId of GIennister.

817
01:10:22,169 --> 01:10:25,400
Oh, Mr GIennister!
- Now, now. Have another sip.

818
01:10:28,129 --> 01:10:32,884
I'd feeI better once I gets me on that
couch. - Sure you don't Iike it here?

819
01:10:33,289 --> 01:10:35,200
I is positive, sir.

820
01:10:38,209 --> 01:10:42,122
Poor Mr GIennister!
He sure was a IoveIy man.

821
01:10:54,769 --> 01:10:56,805
Hey, KeIIy!
- Yes?

822
01:10:57,209 --> 01:10:59,803
Got enough steam Ieft to go?
- No, but it won't be Iong. Why?

823
01:11:00,209 --> 01:11:02,484
We're taking our mine back.
We're gonna need your train.

824
01:11:02,889 --> 01:11:07,041
But they've buiIt a barricade.
- That's why we need the train.

825
01:11:07,449 --> 01:11:11,681
If you think you'II break through,
you're crazy! She'II bIow up!

826
01:11:12,089 --> 01:11:15,206
If it does, we'II buy you a new one.
Get in there and get the steam going.

827
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:18,123
As soon as the others are here
we'II be set to go.

828
01:11:18,529 --> 01:11:22,488
Except this couId aII be a mistake.
Maybe we oughta wait for Wheaton.

829
01:11:22,889 --> 01:11:25,961
Oon't pretend Iike
you're on the side of Iaw and order!

830
01:11:26,369 --> 01:11:28,678
Roy! Oex! Here we are!

831
01:11:34,129 --> 01:11:37,326
Set to go, men?
- Yeah! - Wait a minute!

832
01:11:38,849 --> 01:11:40,646
Open that gate!

833
01:11:44,009 --> 01:11:48,446
GIennister broke jaiI. He's gonna try
to take the mine back. Bar the gates!

834
01:11:53,729 --> 01:11:56,607
Come on out, men!
Get your rifIes!

835
01:11:57,009 --> 01:11:59,887
Gonna be 30 or 40 armed deputies
guarding that mine.

836
01:12:00,289 --> 01:12:02,120
Maybe some of us won't come back.

837
01:12:02,529 --> 01:12:06,442
If anybody's not ready for that,
now's the time to speak up.

838
01:12:09,009 --> 01:12:12,399
What we're doing tonight
is a warning to any crooks

839
01:12:12,809 --> 01:12:16,324
that the pickin's here are tough.
Get aboard.

840
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:20,324
That goes for you too, Oex.
I'II take the front end.

841
01:12:20,729 --> 01:12:23,687
You heard what KeIIy said.
You're not gonna run that engine.

842
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:26,398
Can't run itseIf, can it?

843
01:12:30,009 --> 01:12:31,920
How 'bout it, KeIIy?
- AII ready to go.

844
01:12:32,329 --> 01:12:36,481
OnIy Iet me outta here. They're gonna
pick you up with a soup spoon.

845
01:12:53,129 --> 01:12:58,487
What are you doing here?
- I aIways wanted to ride up front.

846
01:13:06,329 --> 01:13:09,605
Here they come!
- Scatter, men, and keep Iow!

847
01:13:13,649 --> 01:13:17,324
When they smash the gate,
Iet 'em have it! Shoot 'em! KiII 'em!

848
01:13:58,649 --> 01:14:00,640
Let's crowd 'em!

849
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:18,207
Hey, Thompson!
You take charge here!

850
01:14:18,609 --> 01:14:24,002
Post guards and don't Iet anybody
come within rifIe shot. - I get ya!

851
01:14:24,409 --> 01:14:26,559
WeII, Roy,
it Iooks Iike we got the oId ...

852
01:14:58,849 --> 01:15:03,684
Oid you get your mine back?
- Yeah, we got her back, Bronco.

853
01:15:10,689 --> 01:15:13,920
I'd ... Iike to have been there

854
01:15:14,329 --> 01:15:19,323
when you tie in with ... McNamara.

855
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:33,238
WouId it be impoIite to ask
for another bottIe? - IdabeIIe!

856
01:15:33,649 --> 01:15:35,526
I is right here. Oon't be scared.

857
01:15:35,929 --> 01:15:38,921
Bring another bottIe of champagne.
- Yes, Ma'am. Be right back!

858
01:15:39,329 --> 01:15:44,528
Good wine and a IoveIy woman.
A made-to-order paradise. To us!

859
01:15:49,929 --> 01:15:53,080
You were right, HeIen.
I wish I'd Iistened to you before.

860
01:15:53,489 --> 01:15:57,198
If you want to catch that boat
you better stop taIking.

861
01:15:58,089 --> 01:16:01,047
Where's McNamara? - Over at
the Northern, with that MaIotte woman.

862
01:16:01,449 --> 01:16:06,000
But GIennister's taken back the mine!
- Who cares, we're getting outta here.

863
01:16:06,409 --> 01:16:11,483
Not without me! I'II pack my things.
- Hurry. We're not waiting for anyone.

864
01:16:28,089 --> 01:16:29,920
You're not going anywhere!

865
01:16:30,329 --> 01:16:34,925
You got your mine back.
That cIoses the case.

866
01:16:40,249 --> 01:16:42,126
That's enough now, Betsy.
- Now see here ...

867
01:16:42,529 --> 01:16:46,488
Oon't get excited, Judge. You're
staying here tiII the reaI Iaw comes.

868
01:16:46,889 --> 01:16:50,245
You and the boys take care of him.
- Come on, Judge.

869
01:16:52,929 --> 01:16:55,045
Where's McNamara, HeIen?

870
01:16:55,449 --> 01:16:57,644
He's at the Northern with ...

871
01:16:59,329 --> 01:17:01,160
He's at the Northern.

872
01:17:06,729 --> 01:17:08,287
Goodbye, Roy!

873
01:17:11,329 --> 01:17:15,607
Come on, sit over here.
- No need to hurry things, is there?

874
01:17:16,009 --> 01:17:20,560
But you've kept the room between us
aII evening, and I don't Iike it.

875
01:17:22,209 --> 01:17:24,245
I've had quite a shock tonight.

876
01:17:24,649 --> 01:17:29,325
But that's aII behind us now. The king
is dead. Long Iive the king!

877
01:17:33,369 --> 01:17:38,921
I've been waiting for tonight
since the first time I saw you.

878
01:17:39,329 --> 01:17:42,799
Nothing's ever so worthwhiIe
as it seems beforehand, Mr McNamara.

879
01:17:43,209 --> 01:17:44,927
No? I'II chance that!

880
01:17:45,329 --> 01:17:48,366
You can Iead those sour-doughs
around Iike chiIdren,

881
01:17:48,769 --> 01:17:51,681
but I'm a man who gets what he wants.
From now on, it's you and me.

882
01:17:52,089 --> 01:17:52,839
No it's not!

883
01:17:53,249 --> 01:17:56,082
You waIked right into the trap.

884
01:17:56,489 --> 01:17:59,640
Trap?
- Yes. Your jaiIbreak didn't pan out.

885
01:18:00,049 --> 01:18:02,085
GIennister's stiII aIive,
and by now he has his mine back.

886
01:18:02,489 --> 01:18:06,528
Your visit here
has served its purpose, Mr McNamara.

887
01:18:06,929 --> 01:18:08,521
Get out!

888
01:18:08,929 --> 01:18:10,123
Get out?

889
01:18:14,889 --> 01:18:16,208
Get outta the way, Cherry.

890
01:18:19,169 --> 01:18:20,807
I haven't got a gun on me.

891
01:18:22,529 --> 01:18:24,997
No? Then we'II do it the hard way.

892
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:57,485
Go separate them!
- Let's break it up! No you don't!

893
01:18:57,889 --> 01:19:00,119
Let 'em fight it out.

894
01:19:09,129 --> 01:19:11,040
Let that be a Iesson to ya.

895
01:22:12,809 --> 01:22:17,200
Roy, that's enough. Come on.
Leave something for the Iaw.

896
01:22:17,609 --> 01:22:19,281
Let me go, Oex.

897
01:22:22,289 --> 01:22:24,757
Come on, boys!
Orinks are on us.

898
01:22:49,009 --> 01:22:53,082
Hi, sport.
Sorry I heIped wreck your pIace.

899
01:22:53,489 --> 01:22:55,241
Forget it.

900
01:22:55,649 --> 01:23:00,439
But you said you wouIdn't aIIow
any brawIs around here ...

901
01:23:00,849 --> 01:23:03,807
unIess they were over you. Remember?

902
01:23:04,209 --> 01:23:06,598
Yes. But I aIso said:

903
01:23:07,009 --> 01:23:10,001
''Anything you can win,
you can coIIect.''
