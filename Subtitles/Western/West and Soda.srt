Go down coward, which you...

Chicken soft music to the ears:
The voice and his world.

17
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:24,406
She is a pure real sunlighter in this
miserable place of eat and drink.

18
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:29,406
See how she struggles for her bread...

19
00:06:32,537 --> 00:06:38,134
You are cute abelard... so masculine,

00:06:42,337 --> 00:06:45,135

Well, I'm sure you, a big and strong man
want to talk about whatever

28
00:07:15,657 --> 00:07:20,572
it is that big strong men usually talk about
and I know is nothing that will be fit

29
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:26,170
for my delicate ears. I'll be back later boys...
you creeps and if you think there's any of...

00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:35,054
Ehi... pianoplayer, silence ain't golden,

But I warn you, no clinkers,
I can't stand clinkers.

37
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:54,649
I warned him I'm a very sensitive fellow,
it's just the way I am something like clinkers

38
00:08:54,777 --> 00:09:00,807
get on my nervs, anyway he did it on purpose.

39
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:08,332
Buy five foots boots, small box, probably
broke, so no oak playing time not line,

40
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:12,496

41
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:16,175

It's four o'clock, assistants police
aren't back yet.

47
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:21,166

...get up and fly!

49
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:13,169

00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:54,565
Yeah! I'm known as the velvet finger.

53
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:01,648
Bright Broth G. Lie and Murder!

your land eh, eh, eh, eh,

55
00:13:07,297 --> 00:13:10,494
I'm almost sorry that I had
your house burnt down...

56
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:16,249
what's that another pianoplayer,
oh those noughty boys

57
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:23,565
Lands more precious than gold...
I want to own it all...

58
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:39,407
y lands, is mine as far as I can see,
except forthat small farm

59
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:41,767
and that's the only fertile piece
in the whole valley

60
00:13:42,217 --> 00:13:46,972
but it belongs to darling Clementine
but soon it'll be mine,

61
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:49,054
now that I'm the only decent bachelor

62
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:51,532
in these parts she can't refuse to marry me,

63
00:13:52,057 --> 00:13:58,087
I'll have her, her cosy house,
and watt's more eh, eh, eh...

64
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:00,971
that rich green, good land.

65
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:10,327
Simmer down, this is a disonest man,
I give you my word!

66
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:13,733
I promise that by tomorrow
you'll have that juicy pasture!

67
00:14:13,857 --> 00:14:18,009
Good, Bravo,
long live our boss!

68
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:21,932
That's enough, knock it off...
thanks, I deserve it.

69
00:14:22,617 --> 00:14:24,972
Here's... to new land,
have a drink boss.

70
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:28,567
What's that... whisky! We might as
well try it! GOD!!! God...

71
00:14:50,177 --> 00:14:54,537
cubes! They reopened the hunting
season on stage coaches...

72
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:58,377
pull up your pants you sloba
and follow me.

73
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:02,416
It's time to keep our regular appointment
with darling Clementine.

74
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:16,851
My milk improves enormously with
Chaicosky's sex walzy music.

75
00:16:17,057 --> 00:16:20,891
With my crop of cream will be the cream of
the crop as long as we don't have to put up

76
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:25,568
up with any more of that dreadfull rock and
roll, it just brings out the butter in me.

77
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:29,213
This music puts me to sleep, gives me
something with a hot rhythm,

78
00:16:29,457 --> 00:16:33,894
something with a afrocuban beat,
something to make my troops...

79
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:35,894
How uddly-cuddly!!!

80
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:46,574
Ci, ci, ci, ci, ciici...

81
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:52,052
Socrate don't scare the chicky
and don't drink so much

82
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:55,536
you're getting to be a regular
brooze-hound.

83
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:14,815
Here comes Clementine...
it's that time a day. Milking time girls!

84
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:32,127
Clementine is such a good girl she
deserves the very best we can give.

85
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:52,046
Go ahead, I'll stay here ask for
her land and her hand,

86
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:56,176
if she refuses scare her and I'll gallop
to the rescue, she'll find me insistable...

87
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,768
- You must be in love! Ich ich ich...
- Aaaahh

88
00:18:00,217 --> 00:18:04,495
Shut up, do what I say,
I'm the big boss.

89
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,977
When I was only a calf, I saw a rodeo once

90
00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:16,777
and they had a marvelous way
of catching a bull;

91
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:18,973
twirled a rope and zum...
he has the bull by the horns.

92
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:22,175
You girls, if you ask me that's no way
to pick a husband they say

93
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,567
they not pick up bulls that way
they throw them down.

94
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:27,206
I wonder if Clementine
can catch a man that way!

95
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,692
But she's trying to scare the man away!

96
00:18:29,897 --> 00:18:32,536
No, just bad men, that's not
a scare crow she is making...

97
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:35,974
that's a scare bandit. Frankly I'm worried
about Clementine if any of this group

98
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:38,367
wants her land but claimes after hand.

99
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,256
Well, he is ugly.

100
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:45,166
But being a man makes...!

101
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:49,569
Look girls! Here comes the assistants is...

102
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:52,206
Don't just stand there Dolly,
I'll be along, turn the allarm!

103
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:58,049
Oh ooh oh...

104
00:18:58,177 --> 00:19:00,896
Are they coming to ask for my hand again?

105
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:20,736
Hello darling Clementine, our boss who's
hiding behind some rocks out there,

106
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:24,805
said us to ask you for your hand and
your lovely lace green patch of land...

107
00:19:25,017 --> 00:19:28,407
You know this property is all he can think
of poor men he is going loco

108
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:30,488
with desire for it, he is dying for it...

109
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:36,369
He wants it so much that its killing him
and everybody else... bang, bang...

110
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:41,407
Kill your gruesome boys, gruesome...
any too quick for me...

111
00:19:41,937 --> 00:19:47,569
Well, Slim the boss says to scare her
if she refuses, so lets start the show.

112
00:19:47,697 --> 00:19:50,131
Ich ich ich

113
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:02,657
How can I stop them, what'll I do?

114
00:20:02,777 --> 00:20:05,132
Hey, olè Bessy... away...
two... one... two... three!

115
00:20:27,777 --> 00:20:30,132
Ich ich ich

116
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:42,097
Ehi, here, have a good cigar!

117
00:20:42,097 --> 00:20:45,567
Those noughty bandits now, what did I do
with that gun, oh trey're making

118
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:48,655
me so nervous now where's the powder?

119
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,652
Come on, sister!

120
00:20:56,457 --> 00:20:58,971
Yaaaaa... Yaaaaa... Yaaaaa...

121
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:04,577
Pull... pull, till it blows up.

122
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:10,569
- Ich ich ich ich ich
- Ah ah ah...

123
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:16,569
I certainly hope this is the right way to
load it... if it is I have to shoot that.

124
00:21:18,097 --> 00:21:21,976
Give that back to me, give it back so...
I can shoot you...

125
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:28,172
You bully...

126
00:21:35,697 --> 00:21:39,167
That's enough! Dear, gentle lady
forgive these repulsive children,

127
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:46,728
they're just loaded with hot spirits...
...get out of here! I'll take care of you later.

128
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:53,170
I'm the only one strong enough to
control them... but... deep down,

129
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:56,175
they are really not so bad,
they just need a kind hand

130
00:21:56,457 --> 00:21:58,971
and maybe you also need a kind hand?

131
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:06,049
Or... you learn what could happen to you
and house if you turn me down.

132
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:08,174
See...

133
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:15,376
made me your love will be a lot safer...
I love you darling Clementine

134
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:20,572
and I love your land, I have tremendous
plans forthe future of this valley,

135
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,770
tremendous spectacular plans,

136
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:26,487
and ljust happen to have one with me.
Look at that!

137
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:29,769
All of it will be ours.
What do you think of me now?

138
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:36,726
- May I speak frankly?
- Oh, I'm waiting anxiously for your answer.

139
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:40,174
You make me sick.

140
00:22:50,457 --> 00:22:55,736
Hey Slim, the boss got a
little dizzy, take a look!

141
00:22:57,177 --> 00:23:01,773
- It must be love!!!
- Maybe it was a lady's boot.

142
00:23:01,977 --> 00:23:05,367
- Yeah, looks like he got a kick out of it.
- Right...

143
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:12,768
He, funny, his face is stamped
with soulful love.

144
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:17,772
Ich ich ich... It's made a
deep impression on him.

145
00:23:17,977 --> 00:23:20,172
Ich ich ich...

146
00:23:25,457 --> 00:23:32,097
Her attitude has left it's mark in
our minds and on my face...

147
00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:34,975
deeply...

148
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:44,857
...people of the valley today
Clementine turned me down,

149
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:48,736
forthe last time she has refused me her
sweet and love and her valuable land.

150
00:23:57,617 --> 00:24:02,407
He did it! Hip, hip, urrah,
hip, hip the boss...

151
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:11,937
no one... a piece of land but
my patience has run out finally.

152
00:24:11,937 --> 00:24:15,486
I don't like the way the boss shout,
we're in for more trouble than usual.

153
00:24:15,617 --> 00:24:19,974
People you know my reputation as a
great lover of land among otherthings.

154
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:24,972
Cattivissimo... You are all of us!

155
00:24:26,617 --> 00:24:29,211
Uuuuus!!

156
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:33,535
You set them out forthe boss and you...
through tick and ticker.

157
00:24:34,017 --> 00:24:37,487
All right, let me ask you something.
I want to know how deep is your loyalty.

158
00:24:37,817 --> 00:24:40,570
Are you willing to be hit in the
face with a lady's boot?

159
00:24:40,777 --> 00:24:43,371
Nooooo!

160
00:24:44,057 --> 00:24:46,730
Before you answer let me
put it to you differently,

161
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:51,772
are you willing to let your boss
be hit in his face with a lady's boot?

162
00:24:54,017 --> 00:24:55,575
Eh?

163
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:12,650
Now tell me, do you want me to be hit
in the face with a lady's boot?

164
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:18,697
- Nooooo!
- I didn't think you would

165
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:23,646
and so now we'll handle that little lady
the way we've handled the whole valley.

166
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:27,486
We change the last cinema in the stand

167
00:25:27,697 --> 00:25:29,927
in the way of progress that your

168
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:36,175
Clementine does not outlook... up to know
but from tonight on she's got to find out

169
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:40,976
and is up to you to get up for find out to guess
this new entire valley orto get that little lady.

170
00:25:41,177 --> 00:25:45,534
For he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good fellow, for...

171
00:25:45,817 --> 00:25:51,767
he's a jolly good fellow and so
said all of us, and so said all of us.

172
00:27:16,457 --> 00:27:22,168
- The music of nature.
- The rain is very good forthe fields.

173
00:27:22,377 --> 00:27:26,006
Some of you have a cigar?
I start liking cigars.

174
00:27:26,617 --> 00:27:28,573
Dolly, please...

175
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:27,813
Yaaa.

176
00:30:30,217 --> 00:30:35,496
Oh, you are nothing but a worm, a snake,
coyote cat, get out of here, get out,

177
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:38,968
don't let me see you ever again!

178
00:30:42,097 --> 00:30:44,008
Lh ih ih... Bye.

179
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:31,770
I wonder why the light didn't roasted you!

180
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,247
La la la m m m mmm la la la

181
00:31:44,457 --> 00:31:49,975
Oh stranger, this place is busy
as an hotel, sing the alarm...

182
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:04,488
This time is loaded...
go away or I shoot,

183
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:06,567
one...

184
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:09,612
two...

185
00:32:11,537 --> 00:32:12,572
two and a half...

186
00:32:13,257 --> 00:32:16,169
two and three quarter...
two and seven eight...

187
00:32:27,937 --> 00:32:30,167
is he dead already?

188
00:32:31,897 --> 00:32:37,051
Darling, put on an appropriate record,
there is someone dead there.

189
00:32:45,377 --> 00:32:49,336
Who is he? I've never seen him before,

190
00:32:51,217 --> 00:32:55,096
he looks dead but,
if he is dead why does he feel smoking

191
00:32:55,377 --> 00:33:00,576
and if he is not dead maybe he's alive,
that means he's not dead yet...

192
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:08,488
- Ehi stranger are you dead?
- Alive girl... only tired!

193
00:33:09,017 --> 00:33:10,894
Why are you lying there?

194
00:33:11,817 --> 00:33:15,651
- I fell off my horse!
- So I noticed!

195
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:27,256
Ljust rode 1381 miles...
I've got to get out, I can't stay here.

196
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:49,771
You can stay here, what's more
you need is rest and vitamins,

197
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:54,414
meantime tell me who you are, where you
come from, where're you going and why.

198
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:56,335
Do you really want to know all about me?

199
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,573
Well, don't think that
I'm interested in you.

200
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:04,569
Noooo... then why you're asking all those
questions, if you are not interested in me.

201
00:34:09,457 --> 00:34:12,494
Anyway, my name is Johnny.

202
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,972
Oh... the more I look at him,
the more I want to look at him.

203
00:34:51,177 --> 00:34:54,567
- Ssssssstt
- The more I want to look at him...

204
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:57,132
he's beautiful!

205
00:35:22,177 --> 00:35:26,887
- It was an accident.
- I'm sorry, I shoot without thinking.

206
00:35:28,097 --> 00:35:33,217
Mhhh... what a coincidence right now
I could use a fast gun like you.

207
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:39,367
No...! Anything but that don't ask me to
shoot that man I couldn't do it ever again.

208
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:45,210
- Why not Johnny?
- Complexxes! My past is chasing me!

209
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:26,170
Johnny why did you leave your guns at home?
Don't you feel unprotected without them?

210
00:36:28,537 --> 00:36:32,576
Well to tell the truth,
I do feel a little naked.

211
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:16,214
I'm going to do a little shopping, but please
Johnny try not to get into any trouble

212
00:37:16,457 --> 00:37:20,166
without your gun is going to be very hard.

213
00:37:38,537 --> 00:37:44,169
Welcome stranger... oh, oh, ah, ah,
glad to see felling for us, down.

214
00:37:44,457 --> 00:37:51,772
But watch yourself down, if we're
around you could get afraid. Lh ih ih

215
00:38:20,617 --> 00:38:22,972
Yehhhh! Ehi you...
you down the bar with the hat,

216
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:27,529
ye I'm talking to you,
you're new round these parts...

217
00:38:27,817 --> 00:38:33,050
am I right, tell me you fellow, where are
you from, uhm what do you know,

218
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:39,653
which way you end up, we're interested,
and now tell me something else you wouldn't

219
00:38:39,897 --> 00:38:46,450
by any chance be a dirty government agent
would you? You know something Slim?

220
00:38:46,697 --> 00:38:51,771
He must be a mushroom
that pops out last night.

221
00:38:52,537 --> 00:38:56,815
A fresh little mushroom from...
nowhere, ah, ah, ah, ah,

222
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:27,167
I don't like strongsider strangers!!!!!!!

223
00:40:15,697 --> 00:40:17,369
- They're fighting, eh?
- I fell so.

224
00:40:17,617 --> 00:40:19,767
- Dirty fighting.
- It's their work.

225
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,370
Business looks good.

226
00:40:24,617 --> 00:40:26,175
- Is he a stranger? Never saw him before!

227
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:28,772
I wonder how he likes the town.

228
00:41:04,017 --> 00:41:05,655
It's mighty quiet...

229
00:41:09,097 --> 00:41:11,372
they must have done someone in.

230
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:22,487
Sorrow, over six feet, long box, probably
broke sell an oak, best brest, first class

231
00:41:22,617 --> 00:41:26,292
a packing freightining planting
charges to grease digger relatives.

232
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:32,645
Coward scandalous, shame on you picking
on a handsome honoured man.

233
00:41:33,177 --> 00:41:37,056
Oh... you'll pay forthat.
Come on Johnny, lets go get your gun

234
00:41:37,337 --> 00:41:40,886
and show those two horribles
drunkers they can't do this to you...

235
00:41:41,097 --> 00:41:46,091
and I'm shocked at you Esmeralda...
giving such company.

236
00:41:51,017 --> 00:41:54,168
But, I didn't pay the bill for
the juice I didn't drink.

237
00:41:54,537 --> 00:41:56,812
You should have paid
those two bills instead!

238
00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:05,576
When you're angry like that you seem to me
even more beautiful. Ah ah ah.

239
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:08,172
Lh ih ih...

240
00:42:11,777 --> 00:42:16,487
Look at that, look what the stranger got.

241
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:23,772
Gold, shiny gold, it's a fantastic
nugget, you two found!

242
00:42:24,217 --> 00:42:27,766
You mean, that I found,
I won't credible find again.

243
00:42:28,217 --> 00:42:30,970
That idiot of Slim has
nothing to do with it.

244
00:42:31,417 --> 00:42:36,855
Aaahhh! Do you think I'm nothing but an
idiot? I'll review a part, piece my face,

245
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:41,255
then I'll put upir fath hang up in the sun
and swink and fly in your...

246
00:42:41,497 --> 00:42:43,772
bunk and nobody calls me an idiot.

247
00:42:44,217 --> 00:42:49,496
Shut up idiots, put your brains to work
if either of you have got any! Ah...

248
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:56,774
I want him to tell us the way
to find the shiny gold nugget...

249
00:42:57,417 --> 00:43:01,774
there must be many more where
he found this gorges little beauty.

250
00:43:02,617 --> 00:43:06,576
I always had a weakness
for shiny gold nuggets.

251
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:12,171
I love them even more than I love land
and land is gold... Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...

252
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:31,169
Oh! What a lovely silence.

253
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:34,170
Silence is more than anything
else a sysmatic phenomenon.

254
00:43:35,297 --> 00:43:39,768
Ehi Johnny, what does it mean?

255
00:43:40,857 --> 00:43:44,167
I don't know. Very often I don't have the
slighest idea what I'm talking about.

256
00:43:44,617 --> 00:43:47,768
- I'm very curious about you Johnny!
- You think it!

257
00:43:48,017 --> 00:43:51,168
I got that message when you started
cross-examined me, so...

258
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:55,376
face my slightest phisical imperfection...
I've got... as you can see.

259
00:43:59,777 --> 00:44:03,053
Tell me. Why are you complexed?
Did you kill someone?

260
00:44:03,417 --> 00:44:05,772
- Euh... I shoot.
- Did you really?

261
00:44:06,217 --> 00:44:09,175
Crazy, you don't look like a killer.
Who did you shoot?

262
00:44:10,617 --> 00:44:14,166
Oh, well, my best friend.
He was going to kill me.

263
00:44:14,857 --> 00:44:18,566
Did you ever consider going
to an analyst?

264
00:44:19,217 --> 00:44:21,856
Sure I did, it was my analist that I shoot.

265
00:44:24,817 --> 00:44:28,173
The moment I killed him I destroyed
all my feelings of violence...

266
00:44:28,617 --> 00:44:30,812
from then on I never shot another man,

267
00:44:31,457 --> 00:44:34,176
- I only shoot at tin cans.
- Only at cans?

268
00:44:36,857 --> 00:44:42,966
Cans. Bang, bang, you see, full sight.

269
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:45,373
It's too bad Johnny,
because you shoot so well.

270
00:44:45,657 --> 00:44:46,806
I never miss.

271
00:44:48,217 --> 00:44:52,972
Look at this shot, bang, bang and
watch this one, bang, bang, see?

272
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:54,167
Aahhh.

273
00:44:55,017 --> 00:44:58,566
With a little practice any one
can learn to shoot without a gun.

274
00:45:06,777 --> 00:45:09,132
You're strange, you're
even a little luny.

275
00:45:10,017 --> 00:45:14,010
You think so? You are the first woman who
understands me. That's why I feel at home.

276
00:45:14,497 --> 00:45:17,057
How long have you know your
analyst before you did it Johnny?

277
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:20,816
Five years it was and then I've shot him.

278
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,771
Long time, what made you wait so long?

279
00:45:24,937 --> 00:45:31,206
What a domestic scene as he will whisper
sweet nothing listen to your ears.

280
00:45:32,457 --> 00:45:34,846
Well Clementine?
May ask one question?

281
00:45:35,617 --> 00:45:38,848
No, I've already told you...
I rather die than marry you.

282
00:45:39,257 --> 00:45:43,216
So long, this question is for
the brain thincancelor.

283
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:48,491
Will you be so kind to honour us
with your company,

284
00:45:51,857 --> 00:45:56,977
so we can have a little time to talk. Well!
Time is wasted are you coming?

285
00:46:01,417 --> 00:46:02,406
Oh chiven!

286
00:46:02,817 --> 00:46:06,412
...You know, your name sure fits,
you are a gruesome!

287
00:46:07,537 --> 00:46:15,330
Ahh... Ah! Ah! Ah! I get to control myself...
I want him to die. Grr grr grr.

288
00:46:18,857 --> 00:46:20,973
Lh ih ih.

289
00:46:28,017 --> 00:46:30,133
Ah ah ah.

290
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:33,255
Patapim patapam...
Ah ah ah.

291
00:46:33,817 --> 00:46:34,806
Johnny!

292
00:46:35,017 --> 00:46:40,171
There you are... knocking
is confortable... ah ah ah.

293
00:46:44,217 --> 00:46:47,573
Ah!! Ah!!

294
00:46:54,177 --> 00:46:57,726
- And what if I don't talk?
- You're dead meat.

295
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:11,212
All right come on, hold the prey away,
lets go!

296
00:47:23,937 --> 00:47:27,976
Well... we've particularly waited 7 days

297
00:47:28,617 --> 00:47:31,654
for you to answer, have you changed
your mind and decided to talk?

298
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:34,127
Where did you find this nugget...
talk...

299
00:47:34,777 --> 00:47:37,575
Anyone who shoots to an unarmed
isn't wortherto be talked to!

300
00:47:38,217 --> 00:47:40,173
I'm not interested in your opinions,

301
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,493
I want you to tell me
where you found this gold.

302
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,574
Ehi boss, I've got a groovy idea...

303
00:47:45,017 --> 00:47:47,611
why don't you let this massacre
to Government's agents?

304
00:47:47,817 --> 00:47:51,127
We've done such a good job we can get
an incent credit for it. Ah ah ah.

305
00:47:51,897 --> 00:47:54,570
Your groovy idea is square, forget it...

306
00:47:56,097 --> 00:47:58,975
There are other way to kill him
that are very interesting

307
00:47:59,217 --> 00:48:01,128
let me show you the way they work,

308
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:04,170
- I guarantee he will be dead for good.
- No,

309
00:48:05,617 --> 00:48:08,973
I'm trying to make to you coward talk
and to do that he's got to be alive

310
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:12,966
but I don't think we'll have to
waste much more time on him,

311
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:16,886
I'll turn the jof overthe real experts,
there are some busy ants around here

312
00:48:17,177 --> 00:48:18,974
that can make a stone talk.

313
00:48:24,377 --> 00:48:29,132
All right girls, go to him
have a good meal.

314
00:48:43,937 --> 00:48:48,169
Now listen to me horse face,
it wan't do you any good to try to stop...

315
00:48:48,457 --> 00:48:51,813
those ants with your fancy cigar...
they only get madder or angrier.

316
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:56,170
Just tell me where you found that gold nugger
and you can sleep in a better bed tonight.

317
00:48:56,617 --> 00:49:04,171
Look stop trying to make like a hero,
you don't impress me at all. TALK!!!

318
00:49:05,617 --> 00:49:09,326
Frankly ljust feel very causy down
here whenever I've gone to the beach

319
00:49:09,617 --> 00:49:12,575
I've enjoyed been embared to the sand.

320
00:49:17,217 --> 00:49:20,766
Ehi... look Slim

321
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:26,571
Well, but it won't last... they ask already
for another charge. Lh ih ih

322
00:50:10,217 --> 00:50:17,373
Come on, spit out the name of the mine,
ah ah. You only have a few seconds left.

323
00:50:32,057 --> 00:50:35,254

324
00:50:47,777 --> 00:50:51,133

00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:22,566

00:51:25,017 --> 00:51:29,215
Did he escape?
It's true... take a look.

327
00:51:44,217 --> 00:51:48,256
- There's no long gone.
- He's gone. You let him slip, you...

328
00:52:21,697 --> 00:52:26,976
He's gone away... forthis... I should hang
you forthe rest of your miserable life.

329
00:52:27,617 --> 00:52:32,566
Oh, I've got to know where to find
that nugget I can't stand not knowing...

00:53:09,097 --> 00:53:14,012
Esmeralda, how come you thought of her?

336
00:53:14,297 --> 00:53:17,369
It's natural isn't it?

00:53:17,817 --> 00:53:21,605

a man to talk. Lh ih ih...

The guys will beat me up...

376
00:59:00,017 --> 00:59:02,167
And I thought you been kidnapped,

377
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:05,773
to know that kind of danger but... all alone
you were in the cottage of that... that hoty,

378
00:59:06,217 --> 00:59:08,492
and I thought you were honourable and decent...!

379
00:59:08,777 --> 00:59:11,416
- Clementine, please let me explain...
- I get you up when you fell from your horse

380
00:59:11,657 --> 00:59:15,013
after riding 1381miles
and then you treat me like this...?

381
00:59:15,257 --> 00:59:18,169
- It's not true, listen...
- No, Johnny don't give me excuses,

382
00:59:18,617 --> 00:59:21,575
they'Iljust be lie,
and I couldn't stand if you lie to me

383
00:59:21,897 --> 00:59:24,365
on top of everything else
you're not betterthan other men...!

384
00:59:24,697 --> 00:59:26,176
You are just a charger.

385
00:59:26,417 --> 00:59:29,375
She is going too far,
she should never call him that?

386
00:59:29,977 --> 00:59:34,573
The way she is treating that cowboy so badly,
I think whe must have a cosh on him...

387
00:59:35,457 --> 00:59:39,052
Take yourthings and go away,

388
00:59:39,297 --> 00:59:42,369
I never want to see you again Johnny...

389
00:59:45,857 --> 00:59:49,167
I... I be better off myself...

390
01:01:02,537 --> 01:01:05,574
Here you're...

391
01:01:06,777 --> 01:01:10,565
you miserable... you Esmeralda
what kind of a woman you are

392
01:01:11,017 --> 01:01:15,169
to let a man escape throught your window...

393
01:01:15,417 --> 01:01:18,727
and you fool...
to let him run away right under your nose

394
01:01:19,017 --> 01:01:22,771
I don't know what I should do to you
but it should be something very bad.

395
01:01:23,017 --> 01:01:26,566
You don't know how to figure it.
I'll do it. The gold that man was keeping

396
01:01:26,817 --> 01:01:29,968
is so worthy... I will be rich.
Land is gold but... gold is gold...

397
01:01:30,217 --> 01:01:32,970
go ahead shoot him on the nose
you'll save me the trouble, shoot!!!

398
01:01:33,217 --> 01:01:35,048
!!! Then I'll shoot you on the nose next!

399
01:02:08,297 --> 01:02:12,176
Some indians just kidnapped Esmeralda.

400
01:02:12,537 --> 01:02:16,416
They get what they deserves.
Now listen to me

401
01:02:17,177 --> 01:02:20,726
Johnny is the man who escaped...

402
01:02:22,377 --> 01:02:26,131
but Clementine hasn't... and by tomorrow
that rich green land will be mine...

403
01:02:26,377 --> 01:02:29,972
I'll be in person the commander
of that operation

404
01:02:30,217 --> 01:02:34,335
to make sure that this time the job is
done right... and I'm going to be rudeness...

405
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:10,568
Help!
Johnny... Help!

406
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:30,170
I shoot him down like a dog
...ih ih ih.

407
01:04:20,297 --> 01:04:24,973
One doesn't shoot dogs I told him that...

408
01:04:51,097 --> 01:04:57,172

411
01:05:32,297 --> 01:05:35,050
Ah ah ah...

412
01:05:37,817 --> 01:05:44,689

that small unfortunate incident,

413
01:05:47,017 --> 01:05:52,330

I'm not going to divore you.

414
01:05:55,377 --> 01:05:59,814
There is nothing to be breath of
ljust want to marry you... That's all!

415
01:06:15,177 --> 01:06:17,975
You're ipocrit as well as gruesome!

416
01:06:19,617 --> 01:06:24,168
Clementina, Clementina don't you think
you are exagerating?

417
01:06:24,457 --> 01:06:27,574
Anyway you might as well agree to marry me,
you have no choice

418
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,968
you are not leaving this house
unless you do what I say.

419
01:06:32,217 --> 01:06:37,655
Look what you get for husband... me.

423
01:08:33,297 --> 01:08:36,175

Johnny, we are ready when you are!

425
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:44,166
You want us to bring them there for you
or should we wait out there.

426
01:09:00,377 --> 01:09:03,767
Johnny!!

427
01:09:13,097 --> 01:09:16,726
Johnny, I'm so happy you
come back to me!

428
01:09:16,857 --> 01:09:20,167
- He's running away!
- Sorry, I have to go.

429
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:25,816
Ehi, don't leave me out here
I want to see what's going on too...

430
01:09:42,457 --> 01:09:45,051
Bang bang...

432
01:10:00,497 --> 01:10:02,567
like may be two customers.

433
01:11:08,075 --> 01:11:12,944
- Now you can't see me.
- Shoot at me!

434
01:11:14,595 --> 01:11:19,953
- They don't see you.
- I suggest you to light a match.

435
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:22,715
Oh, good idea!

436
01:14:23,235 --> 01:14:26,625
Oh no! From 15 yards up.

437
01:14:26,955 --> 01:14:29,833
You're supposed to feel it
when ljump like that.

438
01:14:30,275 --> 01:14:34,029
Well, not if I can see you come just
because you are stupid on the job,

439
01:14:34,275 --> 01:14:36,231
just enough stupid to catch him.

01:15:08,595 --> 01:15:11,029
It's about time he get

441
01:15:11,275 --> 01:15:14,631
deserves but the rest of his
last dinner as well.

01:15:44,835 --> 01:15:46,507
There's our customer!!!

443
01:16:00,275 --> 01:16:03,824
Go on he was here, I'm sure he was
right behind that light spot.

444
01:16:04,275 --> 01:16:08,427
I think he wasn't, so you better leave out
the light spot and take a look under it.

445
01:16:08,675 --> 01:16:11,428
Even without picking under it
I know what happen right here.

446
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:17,427
That body, by all legal and illegal rights
belong to us, and was not by some devel.

Another gun...

455
01:19:14,155 --> 01:19:16,430
He's a regular clown.

456
01:19:49,915 --> 01:19:55,228
Candy, peannuts, soda pop,
popcorn and gun robe.

457
01:21:08,355 --> 01:21:13,873
I feel bad, I didn't realize my gun
after loaded kills after a fire.

458
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:56,635
Give me a tranquilizer!

459
01:22:21,235 --> 01:22:24,227
But where that nugget come from?

460
01:22:24,515 --> 01:22:29,543
From a delicious Company...
I found it into a soap box.
