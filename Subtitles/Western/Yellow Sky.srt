00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,623
Quite a punch
you got there, ma'am.

175
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,217
Come in mighty handy
when you get married.

176
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,127
You're right, son.
She's as tough as a pine nut.

177
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,395
She oughta be.
She was raised with Apaches.

178
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:14,438
- Apaches?
- Yeah. Fine people if you understand them.

179
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:17,133
- Any of 'em around here?
- Oh, from time to time.

180
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,937
- Come on, Grandpa.
- Just a minute.

181
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,877
What about that food?

182
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,177
Do we get it peaceful
or don't we?

183
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,945
Well, we might arrange
for one night, Mike...

184
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,283
seein' what a lean belly he's got.

185
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,482
I'll send a couple
of the boys up after it.

186
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,063
You shouldn't have given in
to him like that, Grandpa.

187
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,098
I know what I'm doin'.

188
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:44,134
Don't feed 'em, and right away
they begin "suspicioning."

189
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,533
[Laughing]

190
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,869
Now, you act as if nothing
had happened and leave this to me.

191
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,618
What you goin' to all
that trouble for, Dude?

192
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,952
- You ain't hardly seen her yet.
- He's seen her all right.

193
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:09,515
Course, it was kinda worm's-eye view-
him right at her feet eatin' dust.

194
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,962
What do you reckon a girl like her's
doin' anyway livin' in a town like this?

195
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:17,330
The old man's
a prospector, most likely.

196
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:21,496
A little loony. Lots of old-timers
like him all through these hills.

197
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:25,337
- Yeah, but her?
- Somebody's got to look after the old fool.

198
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,579
Hmm. Look!

199
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,787
Kinda cute-lookin', ain't she?

200
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,856
Right nice swing to them hips too.

201
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:43,519
Yeah. And when she tucks in that shirt-

202
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,504
Better let me help you
with that bucket, ma'am.

203
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,743
- Looks heavy.
- I can manage.

204
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:11,049
Just the same, ma'am, somebody oughta help
you carry that bucket up to the house.

205
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,283
Well, now wait a minute, lady.

206
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,758
You don't mean you'd shoot
a big, handsome fellow like me?

207
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,625
[Laughs]
If you got to shoot somebody...

208
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,791
why, pick on Half Pint or Walrus.

209
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,028
They don't amount to nothin' no how.

210
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,439
I've told you once.

211
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,475
Well, as long as I'm goin'
your way anyhow-

212
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,476
[Stretch] You heard what she said.
Sit down.

213
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,409
- But I was just-
- Shut up.

214
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,481
- I got a right to-
- Shut up!

215
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,393
You gotta hit some people
in the head with an ax.

216
00:28:56,501 --> 00:29:00,267
Now, listen, all of you. I'm figurin' on
layin' up here for three or four days...

217
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:04,330
till the horses get their legs back,
and I don't want any unnecessary trouble.

218
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:08,105
- Stay away from those people.
- Listen. You ain't-

219
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,979
Yes, I am. I ain't talkin'
just to hear my own voice.

220
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,983
I'm ordering you.

221
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,486
If I catch any of you messin' around
that house, somebody's gonna get hurt.

222
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,315
- Is that clear?
- That include you too?

223
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,522
That includes everybody.

224
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,726
There's an old saloon
down at the other end of the town.

225
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,736
We'll bunk in it.
Gets kinda cold around here at night.

226
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,389
[Snoring]

227
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,665
- Where you goin'?
- Outside.

228
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:11,765
I can't sleep nohow with this fathead
snorin' like a wounded buffalo.

229
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,868
- Turn over!
- [Muttering]

230
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,471
[Groaning]

231
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,347
[Snoring Resumes]

232
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,926
Sure is still tonight, ain't it?

233
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,201
I wonder what Dude's up to.

234
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,316
Brother, am I sure gonna throw a shoe
if he gets anyplace with that gal.

235
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,883
From what I saw, she'll tear him
in two if he tries anything.

236
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,391
[Coyote Howling]

237
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,185
What are you doin' here?

238
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,517
Lookin' for one of my men.

239
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,989
I told you if anybody came up here,
he was liable to get shot.

240
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:13,062
I wish you wouldn't keep
pointin' that thing at me.

241
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,462
Women got no business
carryin' guns.

242
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,763
- They're apt to shoot somebody
they don't mean to.
- Not me.

243
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,240
You know,
if you was prettied up a bit...

244
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,332
you might look almost like a female.

245
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,280
[Grunting]

246
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:39,482
[Muffled Shouting]

247
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,928
[Mike]
You-

248
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,367
[Grunting Continues]

249
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,771
[Whimpers, Panting]

250
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,038
[Grunting]

251
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:17,255
Just wanted to show you how safe
you'd be if I really wanted to get rough.

252
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,191
You smell. Even Apaches
are cleaner than you.

253
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,326
Why, you-

254
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,402
Didn't anybody ever tell you
before that you smell bad?

255
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,959
Mike! Mike!

256
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,970
What happened?

257
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,972
It's nothin', Grandpa.
It's just-

258
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,542
I just caught someone
prowlin' around out here.

259
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,407
Did you get him good?

260
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,209
Maybe I should have.

261
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,383
[Laughs]

262
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,079
Good thing she can shoot
as straight as she can, young fella.

263
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:21,318
Most women'd have lost their heads at a time
like this, and you'd have been done for.

264
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,951
Ain't every girl can miss
that close... on purpose.

265
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,998
- Do you need any help?
- No!

266
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,392
[Laughs]

267
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,404
Better be gettin'
back on inside, honey.

268
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,498
Ain't likely he'll bother
anybody else tonight.

269
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,442
He's gonna be kinda dizzy.
[Laughs]

270
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,652
Mike, how'd you
come to shoot him?

271
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:02,555
I don't know.
He grabbed me.

272
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,101
He made me feel-

273
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,704
I don't know.

274
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:12,572
I wish I'd let him die
of thirst when he came here.

275
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:36,501
[Coyote Howling]

276
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,526
[Coyote Howling]

277
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,196
What were you doing up there?

278
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,774
I was lookin' for you.

279
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:48,334
I guess you didn't hear what I said
about stayin' away from that girl.

280
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:52,644
[Chuckles] Looks like you didn't
even hear it yourself.

281
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,345
Anyhow, I wasn't bothering about her.

282
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:02,723
I was just nosing around,
following a hunch.

283
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:09,428
- What kind of a hunch?
- Gold.

284
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,459
It doesn't make sense-
that old man and a girl like her...

285
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,562
living up here just for their health.

286
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:20,440
Sure enough, they've got half a dozen cradles
and a big sluice box down in the canyon.

287
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:25,448
Well, how do you know it's not just old
equipment left around here like everything else?

288
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,110
Because there's a shack down there too.

289
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,551
Apaches been living in it.

290
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,419
I could smell 'em
the minute I opened the door.

291
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,287
Strong as a fox's den.

292
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:41,389
Well, suppose they have
found some gold, what of it?

293
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:46,061
Too much money layin' around in banks
for us to worry about any little dab they got.

294
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,638
Maybe it isn't so little.

295
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,140
Well, anyhow, we're not
sticking around to find out.

296
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,235
We're movin' on as soon
as the horses are fit.

297
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,871
Well, I don't know about you...

298
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:03,079
but I'm getting a little tired
of all this robbery business.

299
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:06,281
I've got a bullet floating
around in me, right here.

300
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,416
Some tinhorn gambler
who yelled like a stuck pig...

301
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,995
because he dropped
a few hundred dollars.

302
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,428
Claimed he'd been cheated.

303
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,592
Which he had, but that's
neither here nor there.

304
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,602
I don't know if I ever told you...

305
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:23,470
but I used to have
a big faro layout in San Juan.

306
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,874
Best-looking woman in camp
waiting on me hand and foot.

307
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,147
Then bang-

308
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,582
Along comes this tinhorn-
puts a bullet in me.

309
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:40,016
When I got on my feet again,
the money was all gone.

310
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,024
Her too.

311
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:47,261
She lit out with a fellow
who ended up beating her.

312
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:51,563
[Laughs]
Which wasn't a bad idea either.

313
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:56,038
As for me, I was just
a down-at-the-heels sharper...

314
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,132
with one bad lung,
looking for a stake.

315
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:06,010
But I told them
I'd come back, loaded.

316
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,512
That's why I joined up with you.

317
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,556
Maybe now's the time.

318
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,427
Not interested.

319
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,866
Just thought I'd mention it.

320
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,571
Need any help getting back to bed?

321
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,542
I'm staying here
for the rest of the night.

322
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,738
I'll send the kid
with your saddle and blanket.

323
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,812
By the way...

324
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:45,355
that woman I was telling you
about in San Juan-

325
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,651
Her name was Lucy.

326
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:51,023
This girl kind of reminds me of her.

327
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,028
Same figure.

- Lookin' for the old man's gold, like Dude said.

They're up in the hills somewhere.
They lit out as soon as they heard us comin'.

341
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,390
- Put that down and come with me.
- All right, boss.

342
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,154
All right.

343
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,952
Get in there where I can
see what you're doing.

344
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,203
So you fellows figure
you got a new boss, eh?

345
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,406
- We want that gold.
- Dude said you wasn't interested.

346
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,878
- So we took a vote and-
- Decided that Dude's the leader. Is that it?

347
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,478
It just happens that votes
don't mean a thing to me.

348
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,951
You wanna get rid of me,
you've gotta run me out.

349
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:07,785
You ain't got no objections
to bein' rich, have you?

350
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:10,588
We ain't arguin' about that now.
We're talkin' about who's boss.

351
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,576
[Chuckles]

352
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,704
Personally I don't care who's boss...

353
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:33,544
long as we get that gold.

354
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,448
Now you're talkin'.

355
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,613
[Gunshots]

356
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,658
No sense bangin' away like that, Mike.
You're just usin' up good bullets.

357
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,287
If I could just get one of 'em,
it might change their minds.

358
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,635
Looks like they got gold all right.

359
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,042
- Yeah, that's what we've been tellin' you.
- Let's get it.

360
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,741
My way. Understand?

361
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:15,417
Gonna get mighty hot
up on that hill after a while.

362
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,256
Them two'll get good and thirsty.

363
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,262
All we gotta do is sit tight.

364
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:23,197
Sit tight?
Like a bunch of scared rabbits?

365
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,326
- Well, there's six of us. Let's root 'em out.
- Go ahead.

366
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:33,735
It couldn't be that you're worrying about
somebody else getting killed, could it?

367
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,079
You and Lengthy get in the house...

368
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,309
and see if you can find out
where they got the ammunition hid.

369
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,544
Cinch they couldn't
carry it all up there.

370
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:45,884
You and Bull Run
look around the barn.

371
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,293
[Gunshot]

372
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,461
[Gunshots]

373
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:21,322
Whew.

374
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,893
Mighty hot sun.

375
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:29,688
Almost tempts a man
to drink water.

376
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,729
Well, I declare!

377
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,959
There's one of them
wavin' a flag of truce.

378
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:07,936
[Laughs]
Tryin' everything, I guess.

379
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,110
It don't seem exactly right
to shoot a man wavin' a white flag, Mike.

380
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,375
I'll teach them to come around here,
chasin' us out of our house.

381
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,382
Wait till he gets up a little closer.

382
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,714
You can always get him
if he gets nasty.

383
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,550
That's close enough.
[Voice Echoing]

384
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,723
It's the only white shirt we got
in the outfit. Belongs to Dude.

385
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,729
He's kind of particular.
Don't wanna get it dirty.

386
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,195
Look, I shaved.

387
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,895
Changed my shirt too.

388
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,903
Smell like a lily.

389
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:47,436
Even combed my hair, right
around the part you gave me.

390
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,774
What do you want?

391
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:54,943
I thought maybe you and me
could make a deal.

392
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,077
There's only one deal
we'll make with you:

393
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:00,748
Get out of Yellow Sky and stay out,
or we'll shoot the lot of you.

394
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:04,419
Them bullets of yours ain't gonna last
forever. We found your ammunition.

395
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,593
Soon as you use up the ones you got,
my boys are gonna come up and get you.

396
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,827
Well, at least you
won't be among 'em.

397
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,335
Oh, don't a flag of truce
mean nothin' to you?

398
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,201
With thieves like you?

399
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,501
Now, nobody's gonna hurt you
if they can help it.

400
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,043
But we know you got gold,
and we're gonna get it.

401
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:25,946
Come on back to the house and tell us where
it's hid. Maybe we'll cut you in for some.

402
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,847
You might as well be comfortable
while you're gettin' robbed.

403
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,781
Ask him what kind of a deal.

404
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,621
You can't make a deal
with him, Grandpa.

405
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,661
Fifty-fifty's better than nothin'.

406
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,696
Anyhow, it don't do no harm to ask.

407
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,499
Sit down and keep your hands in sight.

408
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:47,627
We haven't made up our minds yet
what we're gonna do with you.

409
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,165
Get down!

410
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,807
Dirty, double-crossin'-

411
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,248
Grandpa!

412
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,955
[Groaning]

413
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:11,084
Oh, I gotta get you back to the house.
It's bleedin' bad.

414
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:16,497
Oh, I've bled before.
[Groaning]

415
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:22,570
[Gunshots]

416
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,664
Hold your fire!
They're givin' up!

417
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,510
Bull Run and Walrus, get up there.
Somebody's been hit.

418
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:40,715
I sure hope it ain't that girl.

419
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,318
I got a different future
picked out for her.

420
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,527
[Coughs]

421
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,272
I've seen a lot worse than that.

422
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,847
Didn't even break no bone.

423
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,217
Don't look like you got
no lead to probe for neither.

424
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,115
Don't look like you got
no lead to probe for neither.

425
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,984
That's right. Just got
a hole in my leg.

426
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,394
Uh, probing is usually
a two-quart job.

427
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:26,594
[Men Laughing]

428
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,137
You'll have to excuse us, ma'am.

429
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,265
You see, we're used to
men getting shot...

430
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:35,174
and the boys just haven't
stopped to remember...

431
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:38,874
that this is your grandfather
and the only one you've got.

432
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,447
Look, why don't you go?
Can't you see he wants to go to sleep?

433
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:48,524
I think we oughta get this deal
of ours settled right now.

434
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,820
- Where's the gold?
- He can't talk now.

435
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,488
Tomorrow when he's feeling better,
he'll tell you anything you wanna know.

436
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,624
- All right, Mike. Might as well get it over with.
- But, Grandpa, you're not-

437
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:02,000
If we don't, first thing you know,
they'll be twisting my arm for me.

438
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,302
Did you ever have a fellow
twist your arm for you?

439
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:09,675
It don't feel so good.
Get me my pipe.

440
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:23,452
I don't supposed it'd do
any good to tell you boys...

441
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,495
we haven't got any gold?

442
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,196
Yeah, that's what I thought.

443
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,832
You'd just keep hunting for it
until you'd made a nuisance of yourself...

444
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:40,876
until somebody got killed.

445
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,674
Now, wouldn't you?

446
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:49,345
Suppose I admit
that we have got some gold...

447
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,717
but don't tell you where it is?

448
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:56,225
Now, you wouldn't do a mean thing
like that to us, would you, Grandpa?

449
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:18,779
Let me give you boys
a little history of things here.

450
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:23,285
About 15 years ago, heavy silver
was hit here in Yellow Sky.

451
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:25,855
[Chuckles]
The town boomed overnight.

452
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,891
Me and Mike here-
Oh, she was just a baby then.

453
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:32,519
I was a young fellow myself-
not a day over 60.

454
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:34,756
[Laughing]

455
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,196
Well, we was late gettin' here...

456
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:45,035
and didn't manage to put our hands
on anything worthwhile anyhow...

457
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:49,238
so it didn't matter one way or the other
to us when the veins pinched out.

458
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:52,645
Well, it was right hard
goin' for us for a while...

459
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,843
but we finally hit
on what we were lookin' for.

460
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:08,889
Pretty soon we hired us
two or three young Apaches...

461
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,967
from the old chief, Colorado.

462
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,060
[Laughs]
Then things began to hum.

463
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:19,301
You know, I've been smokin'
a pipe for 60 years.

464
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:23,812
[Laughs, Coughs]
I'm still havin' trouble with my puffer.

465
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:34,423
Yeah. What was I talkin' about?

466
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:36,515
Gold.

467
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:42,655
Oh, yes. Yes.
Mighty dangerous thing...

468
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,327
if you want it
out of plumb greediness.

469
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,863
I've seen it ruin many a man.

470
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,870
Of course, I had good reasons
for wantin' it myself.

471
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:57,777
Now, Mike here-
I'm the only one she's got.

472
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:01,339
So, you see, I wanted to see her
took good care of before I died.

473
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,544
Come to the point.
What about our deal?

474
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,389
- What's your idea of a deal?
- Depends on how much you got.

475
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,987
- Well, now, countin' the dust-
- Don't tell 'em, Grandpa.

476
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,360
- Don't tell 'em anything more!
- Well, Mike, I thought-

477
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,559
I had to do something. I couldn't
let you stay up there and die.

478
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:22,229
- Now, listen, ma'am.
I've been tryin' to be patient with you-
- That money's yours, Grandpa.

479
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:25,069
I know how hard you worked
and sweated for it.

480
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:28,702
They got no right to it. Of course,
you can't understand that, can you?

481
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,474
'Cause you're no good.
None of you.

482
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:35,711
- You're just born takers.
- You still haven't said how much you got.

483
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:40,313
It ain't just the money.
Look at him. He's an old man.

484
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:43,756
All he's dreamed about is seein'
this town come to life again...

485
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,057
with people livin' here and
workin' and-and stores open.

486
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,428
The stage comin' through
from Alkali.

487
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,525
And all because of him
and what he done.

488
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,951
You see, Mike? They don't even
know what you're talkin' about.

489
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,758
Uh, how about 50-50?

490
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,559
How much?

491
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,434
Oh, 50,000.

492
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,729
Fifty thousand dollars?

493
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,876
[Grandpa]
Around that.

494
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,971
I think maybe we can do business.

495
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:40,379
Where is it?

496
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,951
Go show 'em, Mike.

497
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,458
Mike?

498
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:06,131
It's cached in the mouth of that
old silver mine up under those big rocks.

499
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:10,236
When you came here this morning,
we went up and knocked out a few timbers.

500
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:12,315
It's buried now.

501
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,680
- If you want it, you'll have to dig for it.

01:13:35,673 --> 01:13:38,301
Looks like they ain't
the only ones around here.

672
01:13:38,409 --> 01:13:40,309
All right, turn 'em loose on us.

673
01:13:40,411 --> 01:13:43,972
They may finish us, but we'll get
our share of them before they do.

674
01:13:44,082 --> 01:13:47,574
Do you think I'd turn
crazy drunk Apaches loose on ya?

675
01:13:47,685 --> 01:13:49,152
They're friends of yours,
ain't they?

676
01:13:49,253 --> 01:13:51,653
- Why, yes, but l-
- You sent for 'em, didn't you?

677
01:13:53,224 --> 01:13:54,953
Well, did you or didn't you?

678
01:13:55,059 --> 01:13:57,857
Why, I didn't know they was
within 50 miles of here...

679
01:13:57,962 --> 01:14:00,988
till some of the boys that used to work
for me slipped in here last night.

680
01:14:01,099 --> 01:14:05,934
Seems like they'd had some trouble over
at the reservation. They were out to kill.

681
01:14:06,037 --> 01:14:09,768
Took a lot of coaxin' on my part,
but I... finally got them to promise...

682
01:14:09,874 --> 01:14:12,104
to bring the big chief here
to talk to me.

683
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:14,644
You know, he's an old friend of mine.
[Chuckles]

684
01:14:14,745 --> 01:14:16,679
I just got through telling them...

685
01:14:16,781 --> 01:14:19,511
that if they went back to the reservation
and behaved theirselves...

686
01:14:19,617 --> 01:14:23,951
I'd talk to the Indian agent myself
and have their troubles took care of.

687
01:14:24,055 --> 01:14:27,286
Huh. Took a heap of arguing
on my part.

688
01:14:29,627 --> 01:14:32,221
That's what they're gonna do.

689
01:14:33,564 --> 01:14:35,464
What about us?

690
01:14:35,566 --> 01:14:38,558
Why, I told 'em
you was working for me.

691
01:14:50,381 --> 01:14:52,713
[Drums]

692
01:15:13,304 --> 01:15:15,431
[Walrus] Reckon what them
fool Indians are up to now?

693
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,906
[Half Pint] Maybe Stretch give
the old man a good talkin' to.

694
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:19,909
He's a great one for makin' deals.

695
01:15:20,011 --> 01:15:21,911
It's that honest face of his.

696
01:15:22,013 --> 01:15:24,607
One look at him and you say,
"By gum, there's an honest thief."

697
01:15:24,715 --> 01:15:26,615
- [Laughing]
- [Laughing]

698
01:15:26,717 --> 01:15:28,685
For all we know, they'll be back.

699
01:15:28,786 --> 01:15:32,813
So let's stop shooting off our mouths
and start loading this gold.

700
01:15:32,924 --> 01:15:35,757
[Stretch] I wouldn't be in too big
a hurry about that if I was you.

701
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:37,760
[Walrus]
Where'd you come from?

702
01:15:37,862 --> 01:15:40,387
I told you to meet me behind
them rocks. You didn't do it.

703
01:15:40,498 --> 01:15:43,956
- Well, you see, Dude here-
- I'm givin' the orders around here.

704
01:15:44,068 --> 01:15:46,400
[Dude]
We'll talk about that later.

705
01:15:46,504 --> 01:15:48,972
Right now, we wanna know
what those Indians are up to.

706
01:15:49,073 --> 01:15:51,234
The old man told 'em to move out.

707
01:15:51,342 --> 01:15:55,108
- For good?
- Huh. He must've been shot
in the head, not the leg.

708
01:15:55,213 --> 01:15:57,272
Well, come on.
Let's load up and git.

709
01:15:57,381 --> 01:15:59,440
Just a minute.

710
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:02,417
Before we talk about loadin',
there's one thing I wanna get straight.

711
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:06,149
- What about our deal with the old man?
- Well, what about it?

712
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:10,091
There's a fortune in there-
enough for everybody...

713
01:16:10,194 --> 01:16:12,128
includin' the old man and the girl.

714
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:14,755
[Laughs]
Now it comes.

715
01:16:14,865 --> 01:16:18,323
Up to last night, I figured
the same way you fellas did.

716
01:16:18,436 --> 01:16:21,997
I was just tryin' to save us a lot of trouble
when I said we'd split 50-50.

717
01:16:22,106 --> 01:16:26,975
If it hadn't been for them Apaches
comin' in, maybe I'd still feel the same.

718
01:16:27,078 --> 01:16:30,912
But the old man played it square,
stuck to his bargain.

719
01:16:31,015 --> 01:16:34,314
If it hadn't been for that, we'd all
be layin' around here dead right now.

720
01:16:34,418 --> 01:16:37,785
Whether you like it or not,
we're givin' 'em their full share.

721
01:16:37,888 --> 01:16:42,120
If that don't suit you, you've got a fight
on your hands and you better get at it quick.

722
01:16:42,226 --> 01:16:48,096
It's a free country, ain't it?
Majority rules. I say we take a vote on it.

723
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:50,633
I told you once before.
I don't like votes.

724
01:16:50,735 --> 01:16:53,829
We busted our backs
diggin' this stuff out, boss.

725
01:16:53,938 --> 01:16:57,135
We've been scared off by Indians,
shot at by an old desert rat...

726
01:16:57,241 --> 01:16:59,641
- and that he-girl of his.
- Throw down your guns.

727
01:17:02,413 --> 01:17:04,313
It's five to one.

728
01:17:05,983 --> 01:17:10,386
Nobody's anxious to see you dead,
Stretch, but we want that gold...

729
01:17:10,488 --> 01:17:12,388
and we want all of it.

730
01:17:12,490 --> 01:17:17,223
There's plenty more left here. If that girl
and the old man want it, they can dig for it.

731
01:17:17,328 --> 01:17:20,354
I've waited all my life
to make a killing like this...

732
01:17:20,464 --> 01:17:23,627
and I'm not giving
half my share to anybody.

733
01:17:40,818 --> 01:17:43,810
[Ricochets]

734
01:17:43,921 --> 01:17:45,821
Give up now,
and we'll call it quits!

735
01:17:45,923 --> 01:17:48,653
You better do like he says, 'cause
we're gonna play billiards with you...

736
01:17:48,759 --> 01:17:50,659
till we run you out of them rocks.

737
01:17:50,761 --> 01:17:52,922
Then we're gonna pick you off
like a turkey.

738
01:18:00,438 --> 01:18:02,406
[Dude]
Fan out! We gotta flank him.

739
01:18:02,506 --> 01:18:04,497
- [Bull Run] But I don't think-
- Who cares what you think?

740
01:18:04,608 --> 01:18:07,236
You're in this now
whether you like it or not.

741
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:48,378
[Echoing]
Come on! I'll keep you covered!

742
01:18:58,095 --> 01:19:00,325
[Panting]

743
01:19:13,677 --> 01:19:15,941
[Footsteps]

744
01:19:20,718 --> 01:19:22,652
- What are you doin' runnin' around here?
- You're hurt.

745
01:19:22,753 --> 01:19:24,653
Get down!

746
01:19:24,755 --> 01:19:26,655
Can you make it to the house?

747
01:19:26,757 --> 01:19:29,317
- I gotta get their horses.
- Horses are already in the barn.

748
01:19:38,102 --> 01:19:40,832
- Well, we had him.
- [Half Pint] That fool girl.

749
01:19:40,938 --> 01:19:44,499
Almost filled us full of holes
with that buffalo gun of hers.

750
01:19:44,608 --> 01:19:47,441
[Walrus] Come on! Let's go back
and load up and get out of here.

751
01:19:47,545 --> 01:19:49,445
And spend the rest of your days...

752
01:19:49,547 --> 01:19:51,606
waiting for Stretch
to stick a gun in your back?

753
01:19:51,715 --> 01:19:53,945
Not me. I'm not leavin'
till we get him.

754
01:19:54,051 --> 01:19:56,019
I wanna sleep nights.

755
01:20:18,976 --> 01:20:21,035
- [Door Closes]
- What happened?

756
01:20:21,145 --> 01:20:25,582
Oh, me and the boys
had a little... argument.

757
01:20:25,683 --> 01:20:27,082
About our deal?

758
01:20:29,253 --> 01:20:31,983
Couldn't see it your way, eh?

759
01:20:34,525 --> 01:20:39,428
Huh. We figured that was it.
[Mutters]

760
01:20:45,202 --> 01:20:47,261
Grandpa!
You shouldn't get out of bed.

761
01:20:47,371 --> 01:20:49,771
Aw, a lot healthier down here.

762
01:20:51,342 --> 01:20:53,242
Here.

763
01:20:58,816 --> 01:21:00,750
Thanks.

764
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,591
What'll they do next?

765
01:21:19,904 --> 01:21:23,101
It's hard to say
with me not there to tell 'em.

766
01:21:30,047 --> 01:21:32,777
You've got yourself
quite a granddaughter, mister.

767
01:21:32,883 --> 01:21:36,148
[Grandpa Chuckles]
I know that.

768
01:21:38,188 --> 01:21:40,884
It's her future that's worrying me.

769
01:21:45,596 --> 01:21:47,496
[Sighs]
Yeah.

770
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:53,771
[Coyote Howling]

771
01:21:53,771 --> 01:21:56,137
[Coyote Howling]

772
01:22:22,266 --> 01:22:24,200
Mighty quiet out there.

773
01:22:24,301 --> 01:22:25,962
- [Horse Whinnying]
- Shh!

774
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:35,909
- Means they're leavin'.
- Might...

775
01:22:37,581 --> 01:22:39,572
if Dude's got anything
to say about it.

776
01:22:39,683 --> 01:22:41,583
He's gold crazy.

777
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,420
Can't tell about Lengthy.

778
01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:48,681
He's got other things on his mind.

779
01:22:52,162 --> 01:22:56,599
You, Walrus, Bull Run-
cover the back door.

780
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,362
I told Half Pint to take the front door
soon as he gets back.

781
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:03,839
I'll cover the window.
If he comes out...

782
01:23:05,909 --> 01:23:09,072
- let him have it.
- Wait a minute.

783
01:23:09,179 --> 01:23:14,116
Before anybody starts giving orders
around here, let's get one thing settled.

784
01:23:14,218 --> 01:23:17,119
I got first call on that girl,
understand?

785
01:23:17,221 --> 01:23:20,213
- Ah, who cares about her?
- I do.

786
01:23:22,326 --> 01:23:24,226
All right.
Go ahead and take her.

787
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:29,261
All I want is that gold.

788
01:23:29,366 --> 01:23:31,266
Come on. Let's go.

789
01:23:59,797 --> 01:24:02,061
[Gun Cocks]

790
01:24:04,001 --> 01:24:05,901
Stretch!

791
01:24:06,003 --> 01:24:09,336
You listening?

792
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,934
We know that if we try to blast you out,
some of us are gonna get hurt.

793
01:24:14,044 --> 01:24:18,606
On the other hand, if we run off
with the gold and leave you still alive...

794
01:24:18,716 --> 01:24:23,813
we've got sense enough to know that
you'll keep looking until you find us.

795
01:24:23,921 --> 01:24:26,913
So we've decided
to do what you wanted-

796
01:24:27,024 --> 01:24:30,653
split with the old man and the girl.

797
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:34,219
Course it's not exactly
what we'd like to do...

798
01:24:34,331 --> 01:24:36,424
but you can't have everything.

799
01:24:36,533 --> 01:24:38,433
What do you say?

800
01:24:41,405 --> 01:24:43,305
[Whispering]
Get in back!

801
01:25:02,126 --> 01:25:04,526
I'm gonna open the door.

802
01:25:04,628 --> 01:25:07,426
[Shouting]
That suits me! Come on in!

803
01:25:19,877 --> 01:25:21,777
Did you get him?

804
01:25:21,879 --> 01:25:24,973
[Lengthy] Yeah, I'm sure we did.
I saw him fall.

805
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:42,498
Why, you dirty-

806
01:25:52,843 --> 01:25:55,368
[Glass Shatters]

807
01:26:01,685 --> 01:26:07,419
Hey, lady! Lady!
It's me- Walrus.

808
01:26:07,524 --> 01:26:12,052
I got Bull Run with me.
He's bleedin' somethin' awful.

809
01:26:12,162 --> 01:26:15,290
[Groans]
This ain't no trick, ma'am.

810
01:26:15,399 --> 01:26:17,333
I got it in the belly.

811
01:26:19,203 --> 01:26:21,831
Looks like the kid's done for.

812
01:26:21,939 --> 01:26:23,998
Let him in.

813
01:26:25,676 --> 01:26:27,576
Bring him in!

814
01:26:33,217 --> 01:26:35,151
[Grunting]

815
01:26:40,924 --> 01:26:43,017
There you are.

816
01:26:43,126 --> 01:26:45,822
[Footsteps]

817
01:26:50,534 --> 01:26:52,866
- We thought you was dead.
- Well, you was wrong.

818
01:26:54,304 --> 01:26:56,204
[Door Closes]

819
01:26:58,075 --> 01:27:03,308
- [Pan Clatters]
- [Water Gushes, Stops]

820
01:27:04,715 --> 01:27:06,615
[Bull Run]
I hurt, Stretch.

821
01:27:12,656 --> 01:27:16,285
I was kind of wantin'
to get back to see my folks...

822
01:27:17,995 --> 01:27:19,895
but I hurt, Stretch.

823
01:27:22,032 --> 01:27:23,932
Can't just let him lie there and die.

824
01:27:24,034 --> 01:27:26,628
- [Gunshot]
- [Pottery Shatters]

825
01:27:32,142 --> 01:27:34,406
There ain't nothin'
you can do for him now, ma'am.

826
01:27:47,991 --> 01:27:49,925
[Walrus]
Funny thing.

827
01:27:50,027 --> 01:27:53,963
He was the only one against
comin' here in the first place.

828
01:27:54,064 --> 01:27:57,227
What are they gonna try next?

829
01:27:57,334 --> 01:28:00,098
Guess they ain't gonna try nothin' but...

830
01:28:00,203 --> 01:28:03,138
get each other and winner take all.

831
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,970
Where are they now?

832
01:28:06,076 --> 01:28:10,240
Dude took a shot at Lengthy, tried
to get him in the back of the head...

833
01:28:10,347 --> 01:28:12,713
just when he thought he'd got you.

834
