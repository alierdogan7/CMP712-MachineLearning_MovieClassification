1
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,594
On the ground!

2
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,111
Goodbye, friend!

3
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,560
We are rich, boys!
The suffering is over!

4
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,755
Well said, Jessie Joe!

5
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,032
You'll finish suffering...
forever!

6
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,835
I have it...
Stop!

7
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,760
I see you've put flowers
in your guns.

8
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,796
I’ll place them
on your graves.

9
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,273
Lower your holsters!

10
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,190
Move!

11
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,117
Good.
Now, turn around!

12
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,671
And what do you want?

13
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,429
- Can I pass?
- I'm busy here, go away.

14
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,840
Well then let me help you...

15
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,040
Start by moving back,
there will be some fireworks.

16
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,110
I love parties!

17
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,549
It won't be a real party,
but it'll be just as enjoyable.

18
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,516
- Thanks.
- No problem.

19
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,352
Hey Mr., yes you!
Come over here.

20
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,270
Come here.
Wait a moment.

21
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,208
Look there!

22
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,914
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye and rest in peace!

23
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,318
- Thanks.
- You're welcome my dear.

24
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,480
On that wagon is a dying man,
I believe he might interest you.

25
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,080
- Who is it?
- I don't know, haven't asked.

26
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,380
Francis Fitzgerald Grotz
found him like this!

27
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,920
Must be escorting the gold.

28
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,751
And who's this
Francis Fitzgerald Grotz?

29
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,120
I am... I come from an unknown father
and a mother who was notorious!

30
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,078
Her name was Sandy Miles,
the sweetest morsel of the West!

31
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,080
And you'd be the
gold's guide?

32
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,433
Yes.

33
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,152
- Who are you?
- Little Rita.

34
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,796
The famous gunfighter of the West?!

35
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,913
Yep.

36
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,560
What luck!
An honor to meet you!

37
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,074
Let us rejoice!

38
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,952
Take me away with you?

39
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,756
- Okay!
- Little Rita, thank you.

40
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,075
This is a nice way to die...

41
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,879
- What do we do with him?
- Throw him with the rest of the bodies!

42
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,513
Honor to you, Sitting Bison.

43
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,153
Augh, Little Rita.

44
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,920
A joy to see you again,
Big Little Rita.

45
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,520
And a pleasure to see you again,

46
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,638
Sweet Apple of the Sky, daughter of
great Chief Sitting Bison.

47
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,040
Three days and three nights,
I worried for you.

48
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:34,280
For three days and three nights,
I prayed to the gods.

49
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,720
I heard you were attacked
by one hundred bandits?

50
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,790
Eight...

51
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,468
And all eight...
dead?!

52
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,560
I made a nice catch,
two cases full of gold!

53
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,710
Two cases?
And where are they?

54
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,756
There, in the wagon.

55
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,958
- Who is this?
- Francis Fitzgerald Grotz, my friend.

56
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,160
- Pleased to meet you, Sir Francis.
- Hi.

57
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,948
- Where are the cases of gold?
- Back there.

58
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,640
How disgusting...
gold is despicable!

59
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,395
- You agree, Sir Francis?
- Dear Bison, you must be exaggerating!

60
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,317
I wish I could have both cases!

61
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,277
I say something wrong?

62
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,040
Another part of this metal...

63
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,400
was taken back
from evil men.

64
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,920
A day not far from now,
Little Rita

65
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,640
...and I will forever destroy
all the cursed gold...

66
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,800
expelled from the bowels of the earth!

67
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,120
Only afterwards
will we live in peace!

68
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,238
May the gods protect you,
Little Rita.

69
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,440
By the next moon we will destroy
all the gold gathered these years.

70
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,595
- Why not now?
- Some is missing... Ringo and Django.

71
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,000
You'll be killed.
Their guns howl like hyenas...

72
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
...and shoot faster than the wind.

73
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,920
There have been many who tried
to kill those two.

74
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,080
Now their bodies inhabit
all the cemeteries of the West.

75
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,520
I'm afraid that is
too great a risk for you.

76
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,080
And that worries me...

77
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,640
But if there's one ounce of gold left,
that means all the work was in vain!

78
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,840
Have you thought that men
will mine more gold...

79
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,600
...and so there will be other wars,
and the kingdom of evil will return?

80
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,640
Destruction of that gold
will be up to others.

81
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,360
What others?

82
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,114
Those who come after me,
they will believe and feel as I do.

83
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,880
Remember Little Rita,
your fate is sealed.

84
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,880
The night will see a red star
bright in the sky...

85
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,340
and you will return to nothing,
because of nothing you came.

86
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:30,720
You are but a story,
a beautiful legend... and nothing more.

87
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,154
Okay... but now
there's the gold.

88
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,514
It's empty!

89
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,991
"Thanks a lot"
...Ringo!

90
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,760
The village is deserted,
as usual!

91
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,240
You better be the next one
to change tracks.

92
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,391
It will be done, sir.
Thank you!

93
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,392
You are?

94
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,868
- Where are you from?
- From where I left...

95
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,040
Give me the guns...

96
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,713
in this village you can
not walk around armed.

97
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,960
All the same! When I ask for their pistol,
 they all respond like that!

98
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,919
With a stupid smile like...
...forgive me, stranger.

99
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,240
I'm the law here
and nobody listens to me!

100
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,040
Sometimes I think that I...
just have the wrong job, understand?

101
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,558
I get nervous and
I feel like I'm about to explode!

102
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,874
Where's Zoco?

103
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,160
- Who's Zoco?
- Where is he?!

104
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:50,000
He's playing cards in the saloon,
but there's four of them armed!

105
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
- What are you planning?
- Guess.

106
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,310
- High noon shootout?
- Yes.

107
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,760
Off by five minutes,
you're early?

108
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,880
My name is Ringo,
I'm never early or late.

109
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,758
Ringo?
The super-bounty-killer?!

110
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,116
Be right back.

111
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,958
- Zoco, we need to talk.
- Start again.

112
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,711
Always one remaining!

113
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,631
Of course, there's an odd one!

114
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,916
- Zoco, come here for a minute.
- Shut up.

115
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,639
Divide again.

116
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,871
There's always one!

117
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,236
I'm the boss
so I'll take it.

118
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,792
Guys, easy now!

119
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,557
With the remaining dollar
we'll pay for a drink!

120
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,756
Out.

121
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,678
Damn! This is what I was
trying to warn you about!

122
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,037
Ringo, don't make too much noise
my nerves will explode...

123
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,070
Twelve sharp.
I'll prepare the coffins.

124
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,278
Play!

125
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,680
- What are you after, Ringo?
- The stolen gold, my half.

126
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,148
We decided to keep it for ourselves.

127
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,440
Bad, very bad.

128
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,160
There is a psalm that says:
Greed leads to death.

129
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,080
One to remember when
the day of reckoning comes.

130
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,755
- That day has arrived.
- For me or for you?

131
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,231
Do not waste time, pray.

132
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,711
Give me a drink.

133
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,829
No alcohol for minors;
Milk or Coca-Cola, choose.

134
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,875
I want a whiskey.

135
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,040
Don't make me lose my patience,
boy.

136
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,952
I ordinarily only
say it once.

137
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,595
For me that's too much.

138
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,840
Do not play with my glasses,
boy!

139
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,789
And you, don't play smart,
I know that wasn't whiskey.

140
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,560
I don't like it.

141
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,917
My doctor advised me
 to leave the life here!

142
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,400
Go up to the sheriff
and tell him we're missing one.

143
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,119
- One what?
- A coffin...

144
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,632
...for Ringo.

145
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,873
Allow me, sheriff?
Can I give you some wise advice?

146
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,440
I'm wise as is,
but say it anyway.

147
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,840
- Prepare another coffin.
- Well if your health is that bad...

148
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,310
- It's not for me!
- Then for Whom?

149
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,670
- Ringo?
- Him.

150
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,600
He's healthy as a bull!

151
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,040
I've seen many die
with the health of two bulls.

152
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,477
You mean someone's gonna kill...
who?

153
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,600
Hello, sheriff.

154
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,116
Your grandson is past his bedtime,
take him to sleep.

155
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,190
Hello, Ringo.

156
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,760
- - What are you looking for?
- The gold that you've got.

157
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,960
One man just
tried before you.

158
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,269
Now his wife is a widow.

159
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,878
I have no wife.

160
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,240
That's it?

161
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,640
Everything I have done
in my life

162
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,280
I did for a fistfull of dollars.

163
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,956
I believe you also did
for a few dollars more...

164
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,988
Grotz, put the money in a safe place.

165
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,835
- This isn't the end.
- Yes, it won't end like this!

166
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,959
Get up... and go!

167
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,639
Serves you right, damn thief!

168
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,312
Go! If I see you
in my town again...

169
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,920
We'll meet again.

170
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,117
When you're tired of living,
call me!

171
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,278
The gun has long-range
we can only pray now!

172
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,036
- How many meters away is that?
- Seventy.

173
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,755
With this one...
it'll fix him for good.

174
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,840
Hi, great Chief Sitting Bison.

175
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,680
Augh, Big Little Rita
how was it?

176
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,440
Well, I had an exchange
of views with Ringo.

177
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,960
He was convinced to return the gold.

178
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,872
- Was it difficult?
- It was a cinch.

179
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,040
Now he is in heaven
among the angels.

180
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,520
You are a devil,
an Archfiend!

181
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,753
- Chief!
- What? Speak, hurry up!

182
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,552
He stole the...
...stole the gold

183
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,150
the stagecoach,
was robbed by...

184
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,073
Django...

185
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,755
Now it'll be settled...
where is he now?

186
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,760
You must know that Django is
a nomadic one. Moving continuously.

187
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,560
The last smoke signals
 informed that yesterday morning

188
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,680
he was in the mountains of Tucson.

189
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,960
- Then I'll head for Tucson.
- Oh, Little Rita.

190
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,670
Do not worry.
I'll go and circle right back.

191
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,949
- Hello.
- Hello.

192
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,000
This the way to Tucson?

193
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,154
Yes, but if you're digging a grave
you can dig it here!

194
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,200
- You're funny, boy.
- I'm not a boy.

195
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,480
Well for a man,
you don't look very mature!

196
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,917
And you, a gravedigger...
talk too much!

197
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,629
Get out of the way, let me pass.

198
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,790
- If I don't?
- Do not tease me child.

199
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,748
I have no time to lose.

200
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,075
I am Little Rita.

201
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,590
And I am Django.

202
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,120
Don't move.

203
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:59,319
They were right to say you are
the biggest pain in the West!

204
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,233
Get up.

205
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,920
You know what I want:
the gold, the gold that was in the stagecoach.

206
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,672
I've made some effort for that gold.

207
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,958
Mexicans broke my
hands with their horses.

208
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,838
Where's the gold?

209
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,400
- Go away.
- It doesn't end here.

210
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,400
A friend of yours
told me the same thing.

211
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,560
It went bad,
very bad.

212
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,357
Go!

213
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,800
- It's a gun!
- Yeah.

214
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,840
He's not a gravedigger,
but an arms dealer!

215
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,360
- Come on, let's get the gold.
- Where can we put it?

216
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,954
The saddlebags.

217
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,150
You were wasteful,
not leaving any bullets.

218
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,236
Does your courage
lie in that armor?

219
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,992
- I'll take off...
- I have no bullets!

220
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,357
I'll turn around,
after all I am a girl!

221
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,875
Shouldn't have done that, Django.
I'm sorry.

222
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,796
Please, Little Rita,
let me die like the Americans.

223
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,800
The Americans?
What do you mean?

224
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,280
I want to tell you my life story.

225
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,236
No, I don't have the time!

226
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:05,674
The Indians and the Japanese
die quick...

227
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:11,080
but I'm a gunslinger...
a famous gunfighter.

228
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,040
I'm entitled to two minutes of agony
before dying.

229
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,996
Alright! Talk!

230
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,634
When I was... a child...

231
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:26,038
I could not bear my father,
but adored my mother...

232
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,759
What a magnificent sight
the herds of buffalo are!

233
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,240
Those are cows!
Four thin cows...

234
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,196
And a wild horse!

235
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,720
- Hello, folks!
- Hi!

236
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:15,272
My name is Black Star,
I'm looking to sell my cattle.

237
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,874
- Where is the closest water souce?
- About two miles.

238
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,431
- Where you from?
- Far away.

239
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,595
- And where you going?
- Far.

240
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,636
Now it's clear!

241
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,596
Have a nice trip.

242
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,040
- Did you see his eyes?
- I saw them.

243
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,440
You didn't take your eyes off him,
you were like an owl!

244
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,560
I'm so happy,
I'm going to scream!

245
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,360
Go ahead, we're in the country!

246
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,316
He's beautiful!

247
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,400
He's so beautiful!

248
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,880
The herdsman is so good-looking!
I'm happy, Grotz!

249
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,348
Women are all the same!

250
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,240
One glance
and they're electrocuted!

251
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,198
I love him! I love him!

252
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,436
I don't understand them!

253
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,160
Who you are? What do you want?

254
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,676
Lucrecio! Emilio! Get him!
The girl we'll take later.

255
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,512
Let me go, damn yokels!

256
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,874
- You've decided to talk?
- No!

257
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,796
What's happening?

258
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:06,909
Well, when the Mexicans hear the name of
their leader, they immediately start partying.

259
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,355
So you want to talk or not?

260
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,396
Walk!

261
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,754
- Sit!
- Leave us alone.

262
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,869
- So you were convinced?
- Yes.

263
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,716
You'll tell the truth?

264
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,400
I always hear of gold
at the camp of Sitting Bison...

265
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,880
and they hide it in a cave.

266
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,640
Tell me how I can get
in there secretly...

267
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,480
and you'll save your life!

268
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,436
Thank you, Sancho.

269
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,480
When you have finished drinking
this flask

270
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,840
...if you have not yet spoken

271
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,360
...with a hot iron, I'll put my signature
on your face!

272
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,316
But you don't know how to write!

273
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:30,160
- Speak!
- You know the Indian camp?

274
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,040
- Yes.
- On the hill is a cave.

275
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,640
- In front is a door.
- Sure!

276
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,872
- The door opens with a magic word.
- A magic word?

277
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,669
- Cintauaua.
- Cintauaua? And what happens?

278
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,278
- In there is gold!
- Sancho's gold!

279
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,236
Viva Sancho!

280
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,920
You were saying
that there is a cave...

281
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,120
...with a door and then you say
the magic word:

282
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,760
Cintauaua!
And after?

283
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,760
Inside is gold!

284
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,593
- There is gold!
- Sancho's gold!

285
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,956
What are you doing here?

286
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,200
I saw your capture
from afar...

287
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,476
and I waited for the right moment
to free you.

288
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,316
Thank you.

289
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,509
Hurry, please!

290
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,196
Bravo!

291
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,351
- The gun!
- Here it is.

292
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,916
Follow me!

293
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,836
Go!

294
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,710
Honor to you, Sitting Bison.

295
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,598
Augh, Little Rita. Welcome back.

296
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,560
I heard you did not
show kindness with Django.

297
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,235
I gave him the privilege
to inaugurate a new cemetery.

298
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,600
- This one of your prisoners?
- No, this is my friend.

299
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,878
Saved me from certain death.
His name is Black Star.

300
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,640
Pleased to meet you.
Friends of Rita, are friends of Sitting Bison.

301
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,269
- You will be our guest.
- Thank you, great Chief.

302
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,276
You love gold?

303
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,590
- No.
- Bravo.

304
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,791
- Our goal is to destroy it, is it not?
- Yes.

305
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,436
Bravo.

306
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,716
Why aren't you sleeping?

307
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,274
- I'm not sleepy.
- Are you sick? - I'm fine.

308
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,629
Tell me the truth...
you're in love, huh?

309
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,639
I confess, I'm in love.

310
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,280
Careful! I can not understand
that I do not know!

311
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,440
But as my mother said, Sandy Miles,
love is like a bullet...

312
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,000
it enters the heart
and ends up in your head!

313
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,276
- If you don't remove it, boom!
- How do I remove it?

314
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,156
With this.

315
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,748
As my mother said:
"Sing and it will pass."

316
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,588
Listen, and stop dreaming.

317
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,237
- Rita, wake up!
- What is it?

318
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,160
- What?
- Black Star is a dead man.

319
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,994
- He tried to steal the gold in the cave.
- Gold!

320
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,480
The Indians caught him
and soon... he will be scalped.

321
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,400
- That Scoundrel! Where is he now?
- Out with Sitting Bison.

322
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,958
Okay, let's go.

323
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,790
You shouldn't have done it.

324
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,556
Why not?

325
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,760
Calm down, Little Rita.
Black Star will pay for his crime.

326
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,040
I do not forget
that once you saved my life.

327
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,720
For this,
I grant you a favor.

328
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:38,120
Black Star, will be tried
by the pale faces.

329
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:42,480
A regular court will judge you.
If found innocent...

330
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:49,238
you will be free. But found guilty...
you'll be scalped!

331
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,876
Your honor,

332
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,590
the defendant here...

333
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:01,595
...it's true, tried to scratch
some of the gold, but who...

334
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,035
...who has never fallen
to such a temptation!

335
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,480
Silence! Silence!

336
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,436
Enough!

337
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:21,631
Your honor, I call
the mercy of this court

338
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,917
and the noble jury here today.

339
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,992
Defendant,
have you anything to declare?

340
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,751
Yes, your honor.

341
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,440
I am guilty.

342
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,396
I ruined everything!

343
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,799
We need the jury's verdict...

344
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:03,480
Are you deaf? Have you not heard
what the defendant said?

345
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,916
Guilty! The accused is guilty!

346
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,356
Silence!

347
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,480
Defendant Black Star, because
you're guilty we condemn you...

348
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,436
...to death.

349
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,397
Silence or I'll clear the room!

350
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:34,120
Since the crime was committed
in Indian territory...

351
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,829
the accused will be extradited there
and executed according to sentence.

352
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,200
The pale faces have given me the honor
to execute a death sentence.

353
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,909
But only after I have performed
the noble traditions of my people.

354
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,036
Ok, Bison!

355
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:30,994
For you to die,
we have different ways.

356
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:36,430
Chopped, sun-dried
hanging from a rope,

357
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:41,196
roasted, or drilled.

358
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,599
What does it mean to be ''drilled''?

359
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,800
Take a pot
full of red ants...

360
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,190
bury the subject
up to their neck...

361
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,120
and place the pot on his head.

362
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:04,557
Then imagine them,
drilling small holes...

363
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,076
tiny holes.

364
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,836
Can I choose?

365
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,949
Sorry Sir Black,
but that decision is for me.

366
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,076
You'll attend a ceremony
you've never seen before.

367
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,513
To kill or not kill...

368
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,476
that is the question.

369
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,200
Big Chief Sitting Bison,
on behalf of your affection

370
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,395
I ask you to save the life...

371
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,036
of this man.

372
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,640
Little Rita, all of this
madness for nothing?

373
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,997
- Why didn't you ask me before?
- Please, don't ask any questions.

374
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,720
It's a private matter.

375
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,480
Privacy is sacred for me
and for my people.

376
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,429
So I close my mouth,
your request is accepted.

377
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,316
Black Star will live.

378
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,911
Hello guys,
looking for something?

379
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:39,240
Go away, idiot! I am Sancho
and I come to rob the bank!

380
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:43,840
Don't be loud, it hurts!
I have a nervous disposition!

381
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,040
- Just don't be loud!
- Go! - Do not shout!

382
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,554
Do whatever you like,
but leave me alone!

383
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,756
Hello, sheriff!

384
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,270
- Give me a drink.
- I've finished everything, I'm sorry.

385
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:07,520
Don't you annoy me too!
Give me a drink!

386
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:11,513
The last two bottles,
he drank them.

387
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:13,996
Who?

388
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:23,040
It's Black Star!

389
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:27,160
But Blacky, shouldn't you
be dead at this hour?

390
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,469
She saved my life.

391
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,040
What man saved your life?
Tell me!

392
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,191
- I said she.
- Oh, she!

393
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,676
Who is she?

394
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,160
- Little Rita.
- Great, fantastic!

395
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:51,120
Let's drink to that!
It's not everyday that you're spared.

396
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,511
Why the funeral on your face?
Did you have a relative die?

397
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,270
Or maybe you've fallen in love
with that little pest?

398
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:08,036
Sorry, Blacky.
I didn't mean to offend you.

399
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,640
- What's happening? - Sancho, each month
he comes to rob the bank.

400
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,471
He comes and goes.

401
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,510
Prepare the coffins, sheriff.

402
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,553
Hello!

403
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,948
- The gun!
- Ok.

404
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:55,157
Now we'll have a little party!

405
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,957
Nice shooting, Black!
You were really good!

406
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:30,080
I wouldn't be able to do
such a thing, even drunk!

407
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:34,119
Now the bounties are yours.
I wish you a proposal.

408
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,314
Why not stay here with us?

409
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,560
You were fantastic,
you've liberated us from a nightmare!

410
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,279
- Thanks.
- We propose you as governor!

411
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:53,000
I can not deceive you.
It was not me, it was him!

412
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,956
Him?

413
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,760
Thank you, sir. You are a hero
and deserve a reward.

414
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,194
But I am a condemned man.

415
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,510
Who is the fool who condemned
a man like you to death?

416
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,312
Joseph, it was you.

417
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:18,236
It's true! Excuse me, Mr. Star,
I had not recognized!

418
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,039
However, that is water
under the bridge, right?

419
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,433
Gentlemen, I propose this
man be appointed sheriff.

420
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:30,240
I have been condemned
and I must die.

421
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:33,232
The Indians have not performed
their sentence.

422
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,636
Now it's up to you.

423
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,037
But hurry!

424
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:45,789
No later than tomorrow,
before sunset.

425
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:05,075
For now we will put
you in prison. Then we'll see.

426
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,996
Your hands, Black!

427
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,916
Do you think that's enough?

428
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,640
Three tons of dynamite are here
and thirty cases of TNT on top!

429
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,596
Think about the explosion!

430
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,433
That's right. Little more, eh?

431
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:21,120
Little Rita, my informant
tells me...

432
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:24,556
that Black Star
has made a heroic act.

433
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,039
He killed Sancho and saved
the money of the bank.

434
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,876
Good boy! I knew
he would change!

435
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,720
He has a generous heart,
that cowboy.

436
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:39,760
- He's not a cowboy!
- Sorry, little one.

437
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,716
Don't call me little!

438
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,996
Sorry, Big Rita.

439
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:49,717
I understand they also wanted him
as the sheriff, but he refused.

440
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:55,560
He said he was sentenced to death
and wants to be hanged...

441
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,357
tomorrow at sunset.

442
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,997
Idiot.

443
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,236
Little Rita!

444
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,475
It looks like you ran here!

445
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,916
Where is Black Star?

446
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:44,800
I thought you would show up.
He is sleeping in his cell.

447
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:49,396
You can't let him die,
I got rid of Ringo and Django!

448
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:53,040
Now I demand proof
of your gratitude.

449
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:56,077
It's not up to me,
he wants to die!

450
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,440
You can stop it!

451
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,400
How can I? It's impossible!

452
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,039
There is a court order!

453
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:09,760
He has proven himself an honest man
and deserves to live.

454
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,680
But what can I do?

455
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,960
Tonight we'll blow
up the mountain.

456
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,916
With all that gold?

457
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,320
But it's a crime!
I don't approve of it.

458
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:24,760
- Later, the village will have
a party, right? - Yes

459
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,880
We also invited
Sitting Bison, you'll come too?

460
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,836
Okay, I will.

461
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:34,596
But during the festival
you release Black Star.

462
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,840
Get him drunk,
throw him on a horse... off he goes!

463
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:42,833
You have quite the imagination,
but it is against the law!

464
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:47,994
All right, Sheriff,
you'll regret it!

465
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,476
One moment!

466
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,118
Hi, Little Rita.

467
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,040
I thought you said
he was in prison?

468
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,840
There he stands now!
He's a volunteer prisoner.

469
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,195
He can do whatever he wants!

470
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:15,638
I understand, there is
one too many of us.

471
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,156
Guess I'm the one?

472
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,156
I guess!

473
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,790
Why are you interested in me?

474
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,353
One day you saved my life.

475
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,034
And once you saved mine.

476
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:50,638
- This is the last time!
- Listen, is the last favor I ask.

477
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,920
I tried to steal
the gold because...

478
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,799
I was convinced that stealing and killing
was the only way of the West.

479
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,560
Now, I know it's not.

480
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,554
It was you that showed me...

481
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,792
there is something
more important than gold.

482
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,874
Maybe we wont see
each other again...

483
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:25,668
but I want you to know...
I love you.

484
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:13,235
It's time for the metal to be
returned back to the earth.

485
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:17,800
In a few moments
the mountain will blow...

486
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:21,200
and buried in its bowels,
the cursed gold...

487
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,000
that created evil
and corrupted men.

488
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
We pay tribute to the great
Little Rita

489
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,675
who allowed us to achieve
this great dream.

490
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:36,114
May the gods protect her life
and our people.

491
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,516
Sir Francis?

492
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:47,233
- Right ahead.
- With pleasure.

493
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,880
Less than 9...

494
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,836
8...

495
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,236
Fire!

496
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:45,189
Rita, what are you doing?
Why didn't you enter the saloon?

497
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,232
It's my fate...
right, great leader?

498
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:03,040
On the night you see a red star
bright in the sky...

499
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:08,194
that night you will go away.
Farther than where you came from.

500
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:14,070
You are a legend, Little Rita,
a beautiful, impressive legend.

501
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:19,439
You come from nothing,
and there you shall return.

502
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,476
Farewell, great Chief.

503
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,036
Farewell, Grotz.

504
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,678
Goodbye, little one.

505
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,957
Where were you?
I searched everywhere!

506
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,596
What are you doing?

507
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,756
And where is Rita?

508
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,477
She's gone
and never coming back.

509
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,236
Gone?

510
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,030
Without telling me anything?

511
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,276
So suddenly.

512
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:39,636
Grotz, tell me now,
why and where she went!

513
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:44,029
She had to go back where
she came from. Far away.

514
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:57,036
I'll find her. I'll find her.

515
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:01,752
At the risk of looking
for the rest of my life.

516
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:24,468
And tracking night after day,

517
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,996
day after night.

518
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,155
As the sun chases the moon.

519
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,875
As the light chases the darkness.

520
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,554
As death after life.

521
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:40,359
The important thing here:
Is to always chase something...

522
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:45,074
with love. Yes, love.
