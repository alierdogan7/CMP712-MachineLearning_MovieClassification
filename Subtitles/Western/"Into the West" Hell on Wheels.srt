Loved by the buffalo had
traveled across the nations,

4
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,165
but had not yet found the prophet

5
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,400
who could make false the terrible
vision of the white man's wheel.

6
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:54,565
He sought the signs that would lead
him to his people's salvation...

7
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,300
but found only traces of those who had
come before and vanished into the darkness.

00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,107
Let the ribbons of the
union pacific railroad

00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:28,506
Omaha, Nebraska Territory
December 1, 1863

10
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,465
unfurl from this immortal point

11
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,800
until they reach the shores
of the mighty pacific!

12
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,600
I have in my hand a telegram
just received from washington...

13
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,800
Which I shall read to you.

14
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,700
It says,

15
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,365
"when this great task shall have been done,"

16
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,400
"disunion shall be rendered
forever after impossible."

17
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,000
"There will be no fulcrum for the
lever of treason to rest upon."

18
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,900
Thomas, jackson, stop shirkin'
and set that wheel on the bench.

19
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,700
They say it's gonna take
10 years to finish the line.

20
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,667
I'd sure like to ride it one day.

21
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:25,600
One train from atlantic to pacific?

22
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:26,600
Whoo-hoo!Ha ha!

23
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,300
Maybe they'll finish it, maybe they won'T.

24
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,000
If there's money to be made, I fully
intend to see our family gets its share.

25
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,300
I want to see 20 wheels
on that wall by sundown.

26
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,200
Come on, pop, you're talkin'
like the railroad's already here.

27
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,165
Listen to me.

28
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,565
We have to make ready.

29
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,700
Haven't I taught you anything, boy?

30
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Pardon me, sir.

31
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,000
My name is clara wheeler.

32
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,100
My father's name was samson wheeler.

33
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,800
You can't turn out an orphan, daniel.

34
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:02,800
The poor thing has no one.

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll send her back east where she belongs.

36
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,000
And where will she find
safety in the middle of a war?

37
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,200
We've heard nothing from
wheelerton these many months.

38
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,900
There are places in st.Jo,

39
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,600
across the river, where she
can be with her own kind.

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It is our christian duty
to care for that child.

41
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,465
We're the only people that she has left.

42
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,800
Woman, she's not even
samson's natural child.

43
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:26,100
Just a foundling he took in...

44
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,067
as was his wont.

45
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,000
We owe her nothing.

46
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,565
What?

47
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,100
Ma's right.

48
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,265
Excuse me.

49
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,400
We just can't turn our backs
on someone lookin' for our help.

50
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:42,600
Not after what she's been though.

51
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Think if it was one of us.

52
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,065
Charity always costs those that give it.

53
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,600
So you'd bear that burden
upon yourself, I take it?

54
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:54,300
Be responsible for her?

55
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,765
Yeah.I will.

56
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,700
And you will answer for
her, for good or ill?

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's right.

58
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,700
Very well, then.

59
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,100
Robert, why does she get to sleep in my bed?

60
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,665
Well, because clara's our guest, lilly.

61
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,095
We're all gonna have to
learn to make sacrifices.

62
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,500
Really, the floor is fine.

63
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,900
There's comfort in just
having a roof over my head.

64
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:49,900
Mother says you can wear some of her
things until she can make you some new ones.

65
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,565
Please tell her not to bother.

66
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,200
I know how to work a sewing machine.

67
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,800
All right.

68
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,700
What you got there?

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,200
Did you do these?

70
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,800
I used to have time for frivolities.

71
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,100
I thought the world was a pretty place,
but it's not.

72
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,300
Well...let me know if you need anything.

73
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll just...I'll be in my room.

74
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:21,800
-Thank you.
-Yes

75
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,900
Mother, take off!

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,100
I'll tell you when it's over.

77
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:46,100
God be with you.

78
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,550
-Go on.Git!

79
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:48,900
Come on!

80
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,300
Aah!

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Oh, my god!

82
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,700
Aah!

83
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,000
Clara! Clara!It's ok!You're ok……

84
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,600
You're ok.

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,900
You're ok.

86
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,165
Ohh!

87
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,500
What's wrong with her?

88
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,950
You're ok.

89
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:07,700
You stay here.

Outside Sacramento, California
March, 1864

91
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:15,165
As governor of the state of california,

92
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,400
I am proud to welcome you to this glorious
celebration of our american industry.

93
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,600
We of the central pacific railroad
have come far these last few months.

94
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:29,600
Further, I might add,
than our competitors on the union pacific.

95
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,400
Bravo.

96
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,800
The great race has now begun.

97
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,865
We may now look forward to the day

98
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,250
when the pacific will be bound
to the atlantic with bands of iron

99
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:43,842
that shall consolidate and
strengthen our ties of nationality

100
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:47,400
and advance with giant strides
the prosperity of our nation.

101
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:48,400
Hear, hear!

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,400
Can you imagine that?

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,800
We can have breakfast in san francisco,

104
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,800
supper in carson city, all the way
to the mississippi in just 3 days.

105
00:07:57,835 --> 00:07:59,600
It is truly remarkable.

106
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,600
It's all changing so fast.

107
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,300
The wheels of progress, my dear,

108
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,865
the wheels of progress.

109
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,700
It is our destiny to smash it asunder!

110
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,100
Shoot, 1, 2, 3.

111
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,700
[Speaking lakota language]

112
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,500
[Speaking lakota language]

113
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,300
What are you saying, my dear?

114
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,200
Oh...something my mother said
to me before we were married.

115
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,600
Her world always seemed
so different than mine.

116
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,900
I'd like to see it sometime.

117
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,200
I don't see any reason
why we shouldn't see some of it sometime.

118
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,500
Ethan...

119
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:49,365
hmm?

120
00:08:49,400 --> 00:09:19,400
-Do you mean it?
-Absolutely.

121
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
That's what we've always said we'd do.

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,800
We could catch the next stage to denver.

123
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,500
Really?

124
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,300
You're brilliant, you know that?

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,800
And exquisitely beautiful.

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,500
You're truly one of the most
wonderful women I've ever known.

127
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,600
And there've been so many, my love.

128
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,200
Oh! -Ethan! I love you, too.
-Mmm.

129
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,100
My daughter margaret and her husband ethan
were not alone in their wandering.

130
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,800
My son abe joined the ranks of jobless men
(Central Pacific Railhead Sierra Navadas)

131
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,950
who threw their lot in
with the central pacific

132
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:27,700
in its 1,000-mile journey
east from sacramento.

133
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,365
By the time it was finished,

134
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,264
the railroad would profoundly
impact my children's lives.

135
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,700
Put your backs into it!

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,400
Come back here, chief.

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,700
The name's abe.

138
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,300
One of the lost tribes of israel, are we?

139
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,965
Well, my old testament friend,

140
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,400
have you had a look at the
offering you just brought me?

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,700
We're trying to keep the grade level.

142
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,765
This won't do it.

143
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,600
You'll have to clean it up.

144
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,900
That's your job.

145
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,300
Fight!

146
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,300
Hit him!

147
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,700
Damn gandy dancers!

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,100
That'll cost you sons
of whores a day's wages!

149
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,300
That goes for all of you! Now, move it!

150
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,600
Mr. Strobridge, get over here!

151
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,900
You men, get back to work!

152
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,465
I will not tolerate
mistreatment of these men!

153
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,000
You can't speak to them as though you
were speakin' to gentlemen, mr. Crocker.

154
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,900
They're as near as brutes as they can get.

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,784
Now, most of these micks will be off to the

156
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:44,900
gold fields as soon as
they can earn a grubstake.

157
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,900
We started with 5,000 men.

158
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:47,500
Now?

159
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,900
I got less than 600.

160
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,100
Well, there seems to be a surplus
of chinese in san francisco.

161
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:59,100
They're said to be very reliable workers.

162
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,600
I will not boss chinese! Damn it!

163
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,400
Denver, Colorado Territory
September, 1864

164
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:13,219
Good God.

165
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:14,165
What happened?

166
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,300
How did this happen?

167
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,800
This is not right.

168
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,800
You got that right.

169
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,600
Look ye upon this outrage
to all civilized people!

170
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,700
The hungate family...

171
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,700
cruelly murdered on their own land...

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,500
land only 25 miles to
the east of our fair city.

173
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,500
Sacrificial lambs slaughtered
by the godless cheyenne dog soldiers...

174
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,400
their bodies cast like joseph's into a well.

175
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,100
Who's this speaker?

176
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Colonel chivington, the fightin' parson.

177
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,365
Whooped the greycoats at glorieta pass,

178
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,600
and he's gonna give these redskins a hidin'!

179
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,600
Brothers and sisters of colorado.

180
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,400
Our territory sits poised
just on the cusp of statehood.

181
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,300
But there can be no statehood without order.

182
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:06,417
Hear, hear.

183
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:07,500
Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,065
And there will be no order

185
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,965
as long as a single savage is allowed

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,800
to occupy one sacred
inch of our precious soil!

187
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
All right.

188
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,700
Now, there is hope.

189
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,765
Governor evans has authorized me

190
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,000
to muster a new regime for our self-defense.

191
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,500
Yeah!Yeah!

192
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,100
Now...

193
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,100
who of you...

194
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,221
will join me in this righteous enterprise?

195
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,200
Hyah!

196
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,200
Grisly business, that.

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,300
Why must you insist on making record of it?

198
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,000
You know that's what we do.

199
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,400
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,800
I was just thinking...

201
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,300
helluva price to pay for some mangy cows.

202
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,700
They say old man hungate was out
lookin' for strays when they butchered him.

203
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:10,765
Yes, thank you kindly.

204
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,850
I'd--if you could keep quiet?

205
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:12,900
Beggin' your pardon, ma'am.

206
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,200
You just leave everything
to colonel chivington.

00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,100

208
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,500

212
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:39,500
Aah!

213
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,700
Let go!

214
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,900
Leave her!

215
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,500
No! Don't kill him!

what's happen?  What are they doing to us?

00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,800
I think they're taking us to their camp.

234

They are treating us as
honored guests, not captives.

235
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,300
Guess they admire you here.

236
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,000
You're one of them.

237
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,400
No.

I've spent most of my life

239

It's all right.

240
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,200
Take these.

241
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,500
It's all right.

242
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,900
I'll be here.

243
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,600
Tell me about this magic box.

244
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,400
We call it a camera.

245
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,500
Cam-camera.

246
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:28,867

248
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,100
The white man's words, they have no, um...

249
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,800
um..music in them.

250
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,300
You speak them very well.

251
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,900
So many white man come.

252
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,300
They fill our land with their noises.

253
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,300
I do not like their language.

254
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,600
Their words...

255
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,400
they have no meaning.

256
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,900
Walkin' under white man's road,
as you have done, it is difficult.

257

258
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,900
does not know where to rest.

259
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,200
Sometimes I...

260
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,700
I feel a hole in my heart.

261
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,000
Ah, the white men are like locusts.

262
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,400
They fly so thick that the
whole sky looks like a snowstorm,

263
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:22,800
and we are like small buffalo
herds who have scattered.

264
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,900
They will keep coming.

265
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,400
They're building a railroad.

266
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,200
It will carry them from
one ocean to another.

267
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,500
That one over there.

268
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,900

269
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700

I am not so ugly in your magic box.

279
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,365
When the white father told those of us

280
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,100
who wished peace to come
to this place, we came.

281
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,800

283
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,100

They had been horribly butchered.

288
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:30,100

289
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,600
This is a lie.

290
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,350

291
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:36,100
and there are bad indians.

292
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,800

they have brought about this trouble.

293
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,300
But I am determined to end this fighting.

294
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
You will help me.

295
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,800
You understand the white man's thoughts.

296
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,800

311
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,000
I want...

312
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:25,800
all the chiefs of the soldiers
to understand that we are for peace.

313
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,500

nothin' to do with his soldiers

321
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,100
I have done my best...

322
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,600
to keep my young men quiet,

323
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,100
but they do not always listen.

324
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,200
Well, by their rebellion,

325
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,100
they seek to help the great
co-traitors who make war on us.

326
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,000
No.

327
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,700

and receives this medal...

332
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,500
I have been proud to call
all white men brothers.

333
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,800
Whatever peace you make must be
with the soldiers, not with me.

334
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
We see now.

335
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,500
I am not a great war chief.

336
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,200

337
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,600

whether it's the greycoats
from the south or the indians,

340
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,300
is to fight them until
they lay down all their arms

341
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:52,700
and submit to military authority.

342
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,400

that, then major wynkoop...

And what will I do with the third
colorado volunteers if we make peace?

356
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,300
The third was raised
primarily to kill indians.

357
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,700
Then they must kill indians.

358
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,000
The tall chief said as long as
this flag flies above our camp,

359
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,000
no soldiers will harm us.

360
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,900
Margaret light shines had
lifted the people's spirits

361
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:38,100
with the magic of the
white man's shadow box.

362
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,865
Now black kettle called on the young men

363
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,700
who remained behind to
search for the buffalo.

364
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,200
All right, men...the gates!

365
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,200
Major.

366
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,500
See that these men are fed
and given a place to rest.

367
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,200
We march on the hostiles
at sand creek tonight.

368
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,600
I've heard of no new provocation, sir.

369
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,065
Don't you know the cheyenne nation

370
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,400
is guilty of robbery, arson, murder, rape,
and fiendish torture?

371
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,365
Not even sparing women and children?

372
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,690
I feel it is right and honorable to use any

373
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:28,300
means under god's heaven
to end these outrages.

374
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:29,500
Including murder, colonel?

375
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,700
Where's sergeant owens?

376
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,500
Sir!

377
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,800
Post a ring of pickets around
the perimeter of this post!

378
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,800
Any man tryin' to leave
will be shot on sight!

379
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:41,000
Is that understood?

380
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:42,000
Yes, sir!

381
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,200
Damn any man in sympathy with the indian.

382
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,500
When will you leave?

383
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,200
Tomorrow.

384
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,800
You have brought us much happiness.

385
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,700
But it's good you should
return to your people.

386
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,200
Many white people will see the
cheyenne as they really are.

387
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,000
They will understand that
your spirits are peaceful.

388
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,100
I will keep this one.

389
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,800
For my wife.

390
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,300
Of course.

391
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,100
This is good medicine.

392
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,700
My husband and i can never repay
your the kindness you have shown us.

393
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,600
You go in peace, my granddaughter.

394
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,100
And may one day...

395
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,500
your heart will be full again.

396
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,600
Thank you.

Sand Creek Village
November 29, 1864

398
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,000
Off with your overcoats, men.

399
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,800
Oh, you'll fight better without 'em.

400
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Remember the hungates?

401
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,100
Yeah!  Yeah!

402
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,465
You look back on the plains of the platte

403
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,000
where your mothers and fathers and
brothers and sisters have been slain,

404
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:01,500
their blood saturating the sands!

405
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Take no prisoners.

406
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,800
Kill 'em all.

407
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,600
Scalp 'em all.

408
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,400
That's right!

409
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,800
Every last one!

410
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,100
Come on.

411
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,600
Soldiers.

412
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,765
Margaret! Margaret!

413
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,200
Listen.  Listen. Take this.

414
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,700
Fasten it to the top of the flag.

415
00:34:00,735 --> 00:34:02,000
As quickly as you can!

416
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,300
The soldiers will see!

417
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,200
Hey!

418
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,600
Stop!

[Speaking native language]

421
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,200
Remember the hungates!

422
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,100
No!....

423
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,100
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!

424
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,000
Ethan!

425
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,700
Ethan!

426
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,900
Ethan!

427
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,500
No!

428
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,700
When you return to your people, tell them.

429
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,600
Tell them a great shame fills my heart.

430
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,400
You are my people now.

431
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,200
Now, you see how these savages
treat their prisoners, major?

432
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Damn you to hell, colonel.

433
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,300
You wanted war?
Now you're gonna have it.

434
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:23,200
North Platte
300 miles west of Omaha
October, 1866

435
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,500
2 rails every 30 seconds, one on each side.

436
00:38:27,535 --> 00:38:28,800
4 rails to the minute.

437
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,800
3 strokes per spike, 10 spikes per rail.

438
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,900
400 rails to the mile.

439
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,500
It's 1,800 miles to san francisco.

440
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,600
21 million times you got
to swing those hammers.

441
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,800
Listen to that sound.

442
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,000
That's money.

443
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,200
Money.

444
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,265
You know,

445
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,700
it won't be long before this enterprise
gets beyond the reach of any town.

446
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,400
And men deprived of their diversions
are inclined to get restless.

447
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,900
So if they can't come to town,

448
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,100
why, then the town will
just have to come to them.

449
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,900
You get my meaning?

450
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,900
Yes, sir.It sure don't look like much.

451
00:39:01,935 --> 00:39:03,100
Not now.

452
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,000
There's gonna be thousands of boomers
comin' up here to north platte from omaha...

453
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,200
men with nothin' to do once winter sets in.

454
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,900
Right here.

455
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,700
Right here is where we're gonna
stake our own little claim.

456
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,900
Our own little empire.

457
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,600
Good work.

458
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,500
Omaha

459
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,500
Take me with you.

460
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,800
No womenfolk allowed.

461
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
It's just gonna be father, me, and jackson.

462
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,500
Thomas has to see to business here.

463
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,600
You and lilly, you look after mom.

464
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,100
I can work as hard as any of your brothers.

465
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,900
Harder, I expect.

466
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,700
Well, what is it, then?

467
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,000
You know father.

468
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,600
You're not like him.

469
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,500
You are decent.

470
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,700
2 stages.

471
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,200
Supposed to be 3.

472
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,900
Oh, well.

473
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Father is father.

474
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:06,765
He is who he is.

475
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,900
There's no use trying to change him.

476
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,600
And there's family. You know what it's like.

477
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,800
They were taken from me.

478
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,950
Out here, we each make our own way in life.

479
00:40:23,985 --> 00:40:26,600
Robert, some of us haven't got a choice!

480
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,600
We've always got a choice.

481
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,500
First wheelers came out
here, it was all wild country.

482
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,000
Grandpa's cousin jacob,
he's first to come out.

483
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,500
Sure heard stories about him.

484
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,400
They tamed so much of it,

485
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,200
I figure railroad will tame what's left.

486
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,100
Just isn't gonna be much of
a west once it's finished.

487
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,700
I guess I just wanna see it
before it goes, that's all.

488
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,300
Let me see it with you.

489
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,600
You're all I have left.

490
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,400
You're my only family.

491
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,800
Father's gonna have himself a proper fit.

492
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,200
Then you'll help me?

493
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,000
I can't make promises.

494
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,100
-I'm gonna take 2 melds.
- Mm-hmm.

495
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,500
Dog star had once believed the white man
would someday leave the land.

496
00:41:31,535 --> 00:41:33,365
Black Hills,
Dakota Territory

497
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,000
Now, with his grandson white
bird and his son sleeping bear,

498
00:41:37,035 --> 00:41:40,500
he saw them come like a
prairie fire on a hot wind.

499
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,492
Many passed through the sacred ground with

500
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:47,400
the hope of the world
bent to the 4 directions,

501
00:41:47,435 --> 00:41:50,400
seeking the yellow stone
that made them crazy.

502
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:56,600
Dog star had heard how the long knives
repaid black cattle's promise of peace.

503
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,100
He feared that a similar
fate awaited his people.

504
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,500
Sioux promised to fight
until every white man

505
00:42:11,535 --> 00:42:13,600
was driven from their sacred land.

506
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,400
The bravest of these leaders sent his
messengers riding through the nation.

507
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,950
Dog star's brother running fox
answered the call to battle,

508
00:42:22,985 --> 00:42:26,500
and invited the great warrior
to speak to their village.

509
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,100
His name was makhpiya luta, red cloud.

511
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,500
[Speaking lakota language]

512
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,000
Red cloud spoke.

513
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,865
and white crow, His son red lance,

514
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,800
and many young men were inspired
to follow him to protect their land.

515
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,500
Sleeping bear and white
bird also wished to fight,

516
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,400
but dog star had already
lost one son to the white man,

517
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,100
and did not wish to sacrifice another.

518
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,800
Keep 'em straight, boss!

What do you know about
railroad construction?

523
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,900
They built the great wall
of china, didn't they?

524

Keep it straight!

Men say you indian.

530
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,600
Yeah?  What of it?

531
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,100
Never seen indian.

00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,500
What bad luck brings you out here,chow ping?

538
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,000
Before here,gum shan,gold mountain.

539
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,900
Fan gway steal claim.

540
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,400
Gold not for chinese,he say.

541
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,300
why?

542
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,900
A white ghost.

543
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,400
Demon.

544
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,850
Fan gway stand,talk,

545
00:45:00,885 --> 00:45:02,500
tell us what to do.

546
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,800
Call us coolies.

547
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,500
Chinese like indian.

548
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,900
Fan gway hit,

549
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,700
steal,shoot.

550
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,300
Come on,guys.

551
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,200
Keep 'em straight!

552
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,100
Incline 75 degrees!

553
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,765
That face is straight up.

554
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,800
We got a clear a shelf 3 miles
long across that bastard of a rock.

555
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,200
Your plan to accomplish this,mr. Strobridge?

556
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,500
Damned if I know,sir.

557
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,200
One-eye bossy man think road not possible.

558
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,700
Use very bad language,but road possible.

559
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:45,900
How?

560
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,700
I'll be.

561
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Now,if there's one thing the chinese
know something about, it's gunpowder.

562
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,750
Ready?!

563
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:30,700
Gung-hoy!

564
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Gung-hoy!  Gung-hoy!.........

565
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,900
Help!

566
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,500
Chow ping!.....

567
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,700
Come on,help me!

568
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,800
Chow ping!

569
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Good

570
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,800
Ft. Phil Kearny
Wyoming Territory
December 20, 1866

571
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,500
The white man's forts spread like
a stain across the people's land.

572
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,900
White crow and red lance join
the warriors of red cloud.

573
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,900
There they would fight to
remove any mark of the white man.

574
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,100
This would be a different kind
of war,  fought like no other.

575
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,000
It would be a war of watching,of waiting.

Captain,the supply train
is being fired upon.

601
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,500
You are to support the supply
train,captain fetterman.

602
00:50:25,535 --> 00:50:27,265
Relieve it,and report back to me.

603
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,365
Under no circumstances are you to pursue

604
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,300
and engage the indians
over lodge trail ridge.

605
00:50:31,335 --> 00:50:32,800
Is that understood?

606
00:50:32,835 --> 00:50:33,465
Yes,sir.

607
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,600
No pursuit beyond lodge trail
ridge,  colonel carrington,sir.

608
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,400
Godspeed,captain.

609
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:42,900
Whoa.

610
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,800
Hold up!

611
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,900
That's lodge trail ridge,captain fetterman.

612
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,800
What's he doing?

613
00:51:31,300 --> 00:52:01,300
Hyah!

614
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,700
please

615
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,400

Donner Summit, Sierra Nevadas
7000 feet above sea level
February, 1867

620
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,500
We're never gonna break out of that rock.

621
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:44,500
We've been trying for a year.

622
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,500
Fan gway say

623
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,400
move mountain, but
mountain don't want to move.

624
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,400
That's white man's logic.

625
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,900
Don't try to understand it.

626
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,500
You'll go crazy trying.

627
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,300
You have people back where
you come from, chow ping?

628
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,200
Have wife in home village.

629
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,900
One day, I finish here.

630
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:15,100
Say to her, "you come now."

631
00:55:15,135 --> 00:55:16,100
Give her silk dress.

632
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,900
We going to live in tai fau.

633
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,565
Tai fau?

634
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,200
San francisco, right?

635
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,500
You learn chinese real good.

636
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,400
I've been studying your phrase books.

637
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,700
Learned how to write a
little of your alphabet.

638
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,800
You have village?

639
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,800
Americans don't belong to any one place.

640
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,000
Just when we get settled, we up and
get restless for something different.

641
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,200
I rode the pony express till it played out.

642
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,300
Never as free as when I
was on the back of a horse.

643
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,200
Nothing steady after that.

644
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,100
Why you stay now?

645
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,300
Never been part of something like this.

646
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,800
Something permanent.

647
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,600
Think maybe I'll see it
through, just this once.

648
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,400
Maybe I'm just a crazy
indian like they all say.

649
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,000
North Platte
Nebraska Territory
April, 1867

650
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,900
Once north platte had only been an
empty prairie 300 miles from omaha.

651
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,100
Ambitious men like daniel wheeler had
turned the wilderness into a boom town.

652
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:49,800
Carnivorous swarms followed the
railroad workers every step of the way,

653
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,000
devouring their weekly pay
faster than grasshoppers.

654
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,700
Jackson.

655
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,300
Jackson!

656
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,200
Comin', pa!

657
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,200
Sure is flush times.

658
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,400
Hell on wheels.

659
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,800
You should've seen this
place before we civilized it.

660
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,465
I don't mind telling you, wheeler,

661
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:31,500
the union pacific finds the very presence
of a sinkhole like this a noxious affront.

662
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,700
I'd like to see you try
to stop it, casement.

663
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,800
You'd have a mutiny on your hands.

664
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,000
Might be wiser for you to start
thinking of us as informal partners.

665
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,165
You appropriated railroad land

666
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:48,200
for illicit purposes and then sold it
to other speculators at 5 times its value.

667
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,165
Don't bellyache to me if the union pacific

668
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,500
swells couldn't see the potential
of their own right-of-way.

669
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,000
Do not presume to lecture me
on what's good for the railroad.

670
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,300
No. That's for you.

671
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,100
You masters back east
don't need any lessons.

672
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,165
Government bonds

673
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,000
16,000 a mile for flatlands
graded and tracked.

674
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,600
32,000 a mile for foothills,

675
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,800
64,000 a mile  for mountains.

676
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,565
Tell me, casement,

677
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,200
how many so-called mountains

678
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,700
has the union pacific climbed thus far?

679
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:22,800
Ha ha ha!

680
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,100
You, sir, are a rank opportunist.

681
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,100
Welcome to north platte, sir.

682
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,000
King of the plains emporium
is the place for you.

683
00:58:36,035 --> 00:58:37,400
Best tables and the best liquor.

684
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,000
They got the best looking women, too.

685
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,300
Here, let me get that for you, sir.

686
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,800
There you go.

687
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,900
Give us this day our daily strangers.

688
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:54,762
-Hey.

689
00:58:55,315 --> 00:58:56,479
- I have your britches ready.

690
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,900
All right.

691
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,500
You'd never even know they were ripped.

692
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,600
5 cents, please.

693
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,300
Almost forgot.

694
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,965
Now those are getting pretty worn.

695
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,300
You ought to let me make you a new pair.

696
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,573
- Oh, yeah? You'd do that?

697
00:59:12,608 --> 00:59:13,400
- Yeah.

698
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,000
I'd like that.

699
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,300
I'll have to measure you.

700
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,800
Step right up.

701
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,300
Ow!

702
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,700
Put your arms out like this.

703
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,300
Well, sure looks like you're prospering.

704
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,365
If I save up enough money,

705
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,500
I can get my own shop and I won't
have to rent from your father anymore.

706
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:40,100
You deserve finer things, clara.

707
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,400
So do you.

708
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,500
Robert!

709
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,900
See ya.

710
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,600
You're needed at the shop.

711
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:58,600
Yes, sir.

712
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,300
Don't let me see you idling again.

713
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,950
Especially with that girl.

714
01:00:01,985 --> 01:00:03,100
That girl has a name, father.

715
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,900
It's clara!

716
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,200
About time you got used to saying it!

717
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,300
Those miscreants will not
trouble your establishment again.

718
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,700
What about my money, colonel?

719
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,700
Are you gonna make good these men's debts?

720
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,500
Good day, sir.

721
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,700
Soldiering in the west was
a lonely, miserable affair.

722
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,900
Some men deserted outright and
others fell into bad habits.

723
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,300
Before officers like george armstrong
custer could tame any indians,

724
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,100
they first had to tame their own men.

725
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,165
My son, jacob jr.,

726
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,165
Didn't like what the army had become

727
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:12,400
but still thought his skills could be
used to preserve peace on the frontier.

728
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,865
When custer took charge of the 7th cavalry,

729
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:20,500
jacob knew it wouldn't be long before
his job went from scouting to killing.

730
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,400
I reckon that this...

731
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,200
Will help morale any.

732
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,700
His morale will improve
when they'll be given indians to fight.

733
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,765
For that, gentlemen,

734
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:36,300
I have relied upon your good
offices to no avail, it seems.

735
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,165
The funny thing about indians, colonel,

736
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,000
they ain't so easy to find
when they don't want to be.

737
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,000
Let me offer you an alternative
explanation, mr. Wheeler,

738
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,700
you, being half-breeds,

739
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:51,550
have not applied yourself to the
work with the requisite enthusiasm.

740
01:01:51,585 --> 01:01:55,600
The 7th cavalry has been charged
with clearing these plains of savages

741
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,900
from the arkansas to the platte.

742
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:04,100
All depredations on lands being opened up
by the railroad are to cease.

743
01:02:04,135 --> 01:02:08,400
You will oblige me by performing
your duties without further delay.

744
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,500
Have I made myself clear?

745
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,400
As day, colonel.

746
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,100
We're finished here. Dismissed.

747
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Thank you, trooper.
That'll be sufficient.

748
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:55,400
We're through.

749
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,200
Donovan, we're through!

750
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,000
They've bloody done it!

751
01:03:01,035 --> 01:03:02,100
They've done it!

752
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:06,400
They built the great wall
of china, didn't they?

753
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,600
Fantastic!

754
01:03:09,443 --> 01:03:09,500
You should be proud of yourselves!

755
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,500
Let's see the union
pacific try to beat us now!

756
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,900
We did that.

757
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,500
Eastward, men!

758
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,400
Eastward to victory!

759
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,600
Medicine Lodge Creek
October, 1867

760
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:47,700
Margaret light shines had followed black
kettle's people in their wanderings.

761
01:03:47,735 --> 01:03:50,900
She began to live the life
of her mother before her.

762
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,850
When the long knife chief sherman,

763
01:03:53,885 --> 01:03:55,965
came to speak words of friendship,

764
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,800
she listened,
but she no longer trusted any white man.

765
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:04,900
It was white men who had killed her husband.

766
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:11,700
The iron horse is now crossing the lands
between the arkansas and the platte.

767
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,400
But there's land south of the arkansas,

768
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:15,665
and before it's taken,

769
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,200
we'd like to set aside a
part of it for your home.

770
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,865
On this home,

771
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,100
we'll build a house to
hold the goods we'll send.

772
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,900
To this home,

773
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:28,700
we'll send a physician to live
with you and heal your sick.

774
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:34,050
We'll send a farmer to teach
your people to grow corn

775
01:04:34,085 --> 01:04:38,300
and wheat and a mill to
make for you meal and flour.

776
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:43,365
For all this, you'll receive
an allowance of $20,000

777
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:48,300
each 12 moon to be spent by
the white father on your behalf.

778
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,900
He says, "why do you come here?

779
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,300
Because red cloud has
killed so many bluecoats?

780
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,500
"This is the time for
fighting, not talking."

781
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,500
From this day forward,

782
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:23,100
all war between the parties to
this agreement shall forever cease.

783
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,265
War will end in the total destruction

784
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,700
of the indian because his numbers are less.

785
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,400
We've prepared peace papers.

786
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:36,165
We ask that your chiefs and
head men hold their council

787
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,100
and meet with us when the shadows
are long to sign these papers.

788
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,000
Many wrongs have been done my people,

789
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,400
but I still live in hope.

790
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,900
I have not got 2 hearts.

791
01:07:10,056 --> 01:07:12,167
North Platte

792
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,100
What am i paying you for?

793
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,500
Get to work!

794
01:07:24,535 --> 01:07:25,500
Move your stuff!

795
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,700
I'm sending the girl back to omaha.

796
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,900
She belongs with your mother and sister.

797
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I won't let you do that.

798
01:07:44,035 --> 01:07:44,800
You won't let me?

799
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,400
You won't let me?

800
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,100
You've been seduced by
girlish blandishments.

801
01:07:49,135 --> 01:07:50,200
It's not like that.

802
01:07:50,235 --> 01:07:51,000
Yes, it is.

803
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,465
If you want to expend

804
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,765
some of that surplus of
manly urges you've got,

805
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,600
-I suggest you do it in one of own establish
-stop it!

806
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,700
I got a mind to teach that little slut

807
01:07:59,735 --> 01:08:01,100
I said you shut your mouth!

808
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:02,500
No!

809
01:08:02,535 --> 01:08:03,100
Stop!

810
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,200
Get off him.

811
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,100
I will let this pass...

812
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,500
for now.

813
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,900
Don't make me choose.

814
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,300
What are you looking at?

815
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,465
Sorry.

816
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,700
I didn't mean to startle you.

817
01:09:12,735 --> 01:09:13,700
It's all right.

818
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:16,700
It was about me...

819
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,700
what happened before with
your father, wasn't it?

820
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:26,500
It's not just the land
that's changing, clara.

821
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:27,900
It's people.

822
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,700
Me.

823
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:31,900
No.

824
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,800
You are one of the better angels.

825
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:37,500
Ohh! Ha ha!

826
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:43,500
Better angels, huh?

827
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,300
The better angels of our nature.

828
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,500
That's what mr. Lincoln called them.

829
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,400
Whoa!

830
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,400
Oh, he's got a spot open.

831
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,600
That's mine.

832
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:00,300
How could a country so
beautiful make men so cruel?

833
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,300
Ha ha ha!

834
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,765
So the towns came and went-

835
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,700
Cheyenne, Wyoming Territoy
May, 1868
julesburg, sidney, potter, kimble, archer.

836
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:10,765
At every stop,

837
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,000
the empire that daniel wheeler sought
for his family grew a little larger.

838
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,965
Then came cheyenne,

839
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,800
the magic city of the plains nearly halfway
between omaha and the shores of california.

840
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,800
The wheelers had become men of substance,

841
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,365
but robert knew that
something more important

842
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,800
had been lost along the tracks
and he aimed to get it back.

843
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,500
Thank you.

844
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,900
Hello, robert.

845
01:10:46,935 --> 01:10:48,100
Let me help you.

846
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,200
That's a pretty dress, clara.

847
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,300
It speaks of a real delicate sensibility.

848
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,500
Delicate?

849
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,200
Is that how you see me?

850
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,465
No.

851
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,500
I was just

852
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,965
all I meant to say was it's just nice to see

853
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,400
some refinement in a place
such as this, that's all.

854
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,800
Thank you.

855
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,200
You did just what you said you would.

856
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:14,865
I'm proud of you.

857
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,100
Let me show you something.

858
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,400
Clara...

859
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,900
-these are-
- vanities, I know.

860
01:11:34,935 --> 01:11:36,200
No. No, not at all.

861
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,000
These are... great.

862
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,500
I never thought I'd take up drawing again.

863
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,100
When I was a girl, I had such ambitions.

864
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,300
I dreamed of owning a ladies' emporium

865
01:11:48,335 --> 01:11:51,800
in a place like new york or san francisco.

866
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,465
I imagined myself

867
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,800
traveling to all the great
capitals of europe and...

868
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,300
I had time to dream then, I suppose.

869
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,200
You should never stop dreaming, clara.

870
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,800
That was...

871
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,500
bold of me.

872
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,300
Not nearly bold enough, robert wheeler.

873
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,200
Humbolt Sink, Great Basin
Nevada June, 1868

874
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,600
donovan!

875
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,865
A jackrabbit would need a canteen

876
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,800
and a haversack to get through this desert.

877
01:12:48,835 --> 01:12:50,700
Makes me wish we were back in the mountains.

878
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:52,465
Damn it!

879
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,200
Put your backs into it!

880
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:00,000
Every mile we make the
mother-lovin' union pacific makes 4!

881
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,800
Now you work as though heaven itself
were before you and hell behind you!

882
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,500
This isn't a ladies' social, donovan!

883
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,900
Beggin' your pardon, mr. Strobridge.

884
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,900
You work these men any harder,
you're not gonna have one left.

885
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,300
The heat, sir.

886
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,300
You get these cursed celestials digging!

887
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,465
If you don't get these
chinese working, donovan,

888
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,900
you and the other walking bosses will
have to take their place on the line.

889
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,800
I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.

890
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:43,767
What did you say?

891
01:13:43,802 --> 01:13:44,700
Can't or won't?

892
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,600
No disrespect meant, sir.

893
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,600
But we're gonna finish
this railroad together

894
01:13:49,635 --> 01:13:51,800
or we're not gonna finish it!

895
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,600
Let them have their damn rest.

896
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,400
We resume work first light tomorrow morning.

897
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,800
Yes, sir!

898
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,100
Thought you said you didn't
have any use for the chinese.

899
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,000
Got even less for bosses.

900
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,100
Ft. Phil Kearny
Wyoming Territoy
August, 1868

901
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,265
After 2 years of fighting,

902
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:28,800
the long knives abandoned
their fort and signed a treaty

903
01:14:28,835 --> 01:14:32,300
that gave the sacred
lands back to the lakota.

904
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,350
The red cloud had done what no man,

905
01:14:35,385 --> 01:14:37,900
white or indian, thought possible.

906
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,800
Young warriors took heart
from this great victory.

907
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,950
Many who had gone to the reservations

908
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:47,300
began to return to their hunting grounds.

909
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,200
There they found the white men.

910
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,400
The circle of violence was renewed.

911
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:57,500
Punishment fell on those
who did not seek war.

912
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:58,800
Black Kettle's Camp
Washita River

913
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,500
See that, mr. Wheeler?

914
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,000
A presentiment of victory.

915
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,900
Heaven sent, colonel.

916
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:21,000
Fine work, scouts.
I will send for you if I have need.

917
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,200
The garry owen, if you please, corporal.

918
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,200
Hyah!

919
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:55,200
Soldiers! Soldiers!

920
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,550
All around us!

921
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:57,700
See to the women.

922
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,700
Save as many as you can.

923
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,000
We're living in a nightmare.

924
01:16:04,035 --> 01:16:05,500
We will meet again.

925
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,800
Colonel wants to see you.

926
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,300
Give me that coat.

927
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,800
Now!

928
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,300
Keep moving!

929
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:14,600
Go on!

930
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,800
Get back in line!

931
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,900
Margaret?

932
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,900
Git!

933
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:52,900
Fort Hays, Kansas
7th Cavalry Headquarters

934
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,600
That one doesn't look like such
a bad sort,does she,armstrong?

935
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,900
Their women possess a fierceness
not found in our more refined sex.

936
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,000
Those who have not been too
degraded by being mere chattels

937
01:18:09,035 --> 01:18:11,900
may yet learn some rudimentary manners.

938
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,400
And what's your name?

939
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,500
This one goes by margaret,ma'am.

940
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:20,600
Margaret.

941
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,300
That's a lovely name.

942
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,400
It's nice to have met you,margaret.

943
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,700
[Speaking lakota language]

944
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,300
Oh,that's the one.

945
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,400
You tell the lieutenant
to mind his privates.

946
01:19:15,435 --> 01:19:17,200
This one's a wildcat.

947
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,600
No! Take me back!

948
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,900
Stop fighting me!  Ain't
nothing gonna happen to you.

949
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,400
You're nothing but a murderer
like the rest of them!

950
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:29,200
No! No!

951
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,900
Listen to me,listen to me.

952
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,100
shu shu... It's ok.

953
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:36,700
Listen to me.

954
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,500
I'm gonna march you through that gate.

955
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,600
There's a pony waiting at the corrals,ok?

956
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:41,700
You get on it.

957
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,700
You go ride clear of here,you understand me?

958
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,300
No,I won't!

959
01:19:45,335 --> 01:19:46,000
No!

960
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,100
Aah! Take me back!

961
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,200
You don't belong with these people!

962
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:54,300
You don't belong with them!

963
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,265
These people-

964
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:10,900
- they're my sisters and my mothers,

965
01:20:10,935 --> 01:20:14,700
my children,and my brothers!

966
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,400
I won't leave them!

967
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,000
You ain't talkin' sense,margaret.

968
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:22,600
How can I ever face ma and pa if
I don't see you safe out of here?

969
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,100
You tell them...

970
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,900
their daughter margaret died at sand creek.

971
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:42,400
Lived to see the white man keep
his promises on the washita.

972
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:46,300
You tell them that the hole in my heart...

973
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,500
is now filled with sorrow.

974
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,900
You tell them...

975
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,400
that I can never be who I was.

976
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,200
Tell them that I love them.

977
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,900
Will you do this for me, jacob?

978
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,600
Will you tell them these things, jacob?

979
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,500
The lines will meet at promontory summit.

980
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,800
Utah's mormon country.

981
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,000
But they say brother brigham appreciates
the work of a gentile dollar.

982
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,900
When they drive that last spike,
a real opportunity begins.

983
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,500
We'll have our pick of the spur lines and...

984
01:22:25,535 --> 01:22:26,300
hauling contracts.

985
01:22:26,335 --> 01:22:27,400
Yes.

986
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,200
I don't want any part of it.

987
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,300
I had hoped to bestow upon
you our family's good fortune.

988
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,265
That is no more or less than my obligation

989
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,500
as it is yours to respect
and serve our businesses here.

990
01:22:42,535 --> 01:22:44,600
And I'll carry out my
duties until the rails meet.

991
01:22:44,635 --> 01:22:46,000
I owe you that.

992
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,900
Once it's finished, I'm
striking out on my own.

993
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,100
You display no aptitude for enterprise, sir.

994
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,000
That girl has a better head for
business than you'll ever have.

995
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,865
I underestimated her.

996
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,900
Clara, father. Can you say her name?

997
01:23:02,935 --> 01:23:03,700
Clara.

998
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,400
Clara.

999
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:10,300
She makes people nice things.

1000
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,700
Taking advantage of their weakness
doesn't seem much a business to me.

1001
01:23:14,735 --> 01:23:16,500
Different times call for different methods.

1002
01:23:16,535 --> 01:23:17,765
Oh, if that's progress,

1003
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,700
I suppose I don't want much a part of it.

1004
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,100
You better think hard on your future, boy.

1005
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,000
You boys earned it.

1006
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,300
Now fill it to the brim.

1007
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:55,600
All right.

1008
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:03,750
The union pacific.

1009
01:24:03,785 --> 01:24:05,000
Late as usual.

1010
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:24,500
Promontory Point, Utah
May 10, 1869

1011
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,165
For my wayward son abe,

1012
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:34,500
that may morning was a
triumph like no other.

1013
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,750
A ribbon of iron stretched 1,800 miles

1014
01:24:37,785 --> 01:24:40,700
from the mississippi to the pacific ocean.

1015
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,200
When those final rails were laid,

1016
01:24:44,235 --> 01:24:46,200
america changed forever.

1017
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,900
The final spike!

1018
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,200
Preacher.

1019
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:04,700
Some men fancied that they represented
the future of that new america,

1020
01:25:04,735 --> 01:25:06,965
but it was men and women like robert

1021
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,500
and clara who would come
to embody its true spirit.

1022
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,265
Their pluck and determination

1023
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:16,600
would be sorely tested in
the years that lay ahead.

1024
01:25:16,635 --> 01:25:18,465
We're right here today

1025
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,700
Bless this majestic road and
all those who ride upon it.

1026
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,300
May they and their business prosper.

1027
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,500
Now...

1028
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,600
where we now stand...

1029
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,800
but a few months since could be seen nothing
but the path of the red man.

1030
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:46,100
Now, a thousand wheels will bear on
their axles the wealth of half the world,

1031
01:25:46,135 --> 01:25:47,400
drawn by the iron horse,

1032
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,565
darkening the landscape
with its smoky breath,

1033
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:54,400
and startling the wild indian
with its piercing scream!

1034
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:00,165
We are a great people

1035
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,200
and can accomplish great things!

1036
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,500
You micks get down off that train!

1037
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:03,500
Get the real railroad men up here!

1038
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,200
All right, all right, time for a photograph!

1039
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,900
All you micks, break up.

1040
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:12,900
Get down from those rails, you chinese!

1041
01:28:12,935 --> 01:28:13,700
Come on!

1042
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,500
At least we got this to show for it.

1043
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,900
They can't ever take this away from us.

1044
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,400
Good luck in tai fau.

1045
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:41,200
You watch out for fan gway.

1046
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,000
Can't escape 'em.

1047
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,800
They're everywhere.

1048
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,893
All still now!
