Make yourself at home, Twillie.

344
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:25,728
If you still care to play cards,
there's always a game.

345
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:29,603
Naturally. There may be a game of flinch
back there, too. I was very good at...

MULLIGAN: In the alcove there.
TWILLIE: Thanks.

Well, I'll see you later
and we'll have another little conversation.

I'll make it $200.

TWILLIE: Playing lone hand?

353
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:00,203
Up to now.

354
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:04,087
Would you like to engage
in a little game of Cut?

355

The higher card wins?

356
00:25:06,455 --> 00:25:09,333
- What stakes?
- Make it easy on yourself.

357
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,845
- $100, gold.
- I'll cover that.

The country is fraught with marauders.

361
00:25:28,215 --> 00:25:30,251

00:56:35,655 --> 00:56:37,930
MAN 1: Straight.
TWILLIE: Straight whiskey, thank you.

845
00:56:38,015 --> 00:56:39,368
I says there ain't a man...

846
00:56:39,455 --> 00:56:40,604
[Hiccups]

847
00:56:41,335 --> 00:56:42,563
You're full of helium.

848
00:56:42,815 --> 00:56:46,808
You better not take off your shoes.
You'll go straight up in the air. Now, listen...

849
00:56:46,895 --> 00:56:49,125
go over there and sit down
at one of those tables.

850
00:56:49,215 --> 00:56:53,413
The best man that ever breathed ain't good
enough for the worst woman in the world.

851
00:56:53,775 --> 00:56:56,209
Now listen, you pygmy.

852
00:56:56,615 --> 00:56:58,685
Go over and sit down
at one of those tables...

853
00:56:58,775 --> 00:57:01,369
or I'll take you out of here
and throw you on your head.

854
00:57:01,455 --> 00:57:03,605
You and who else?

855
00:57:05,415 --> 00:57:06,973
Me and Squawk Mulligan.

856
00:57:08,975 --> 00:57:10,090
Okay.

857
00:57:10,975 --> 00:57:13,091
You big tomboy.

858
00:57:15,695 --> 00:57:18,163
TWILLIE: Can you beat that?
MAN 1: Kinda tough.

859
00:57:18,255 --> 00:57:19,483
Tough, nothing.

860
00:57:20,255 --> 00:57:24,043
If I was in condition, and I had Squawk
with me, I could lick two of them.

861
00:57:24,135 --> 00:57:26,524
MAN 1: Give me a shot of that panther.
TWILLIE: Yeah.

862
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:31,529
I am tending bar one time down
the Lower East Side of New York.

863
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:35,325
A tough paloma comes in there
by the name of Chicago Molly.

864
00:57:35,815 --> 00:57:38,693
I cautioned her,
"None of your peccadilloes in here."

865
00:57:39,855 --> 00:57:43,609
There was some hot lunch
on the bar comprising of succotash...

866
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:46,925
Philadelphia cream cheese...

867
00:57:47,175 --> 00:57:50,087
and asparagus with mayonnaise.

868
00:57:51,415 --> 00:57:54,248
She dips her mitt down in to this melange...

869
00:57:54,335 --> 00:57:57,293
I'm yawning at the time,
and she hits me right in the mug with it.

870
00:57:57,375 --> 00:57:58,444
[Man 1 chuckles]

871
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:01,130
I jumps over the bar and knocks her down.

872
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,970
Where's the funnel?

873
00:58:03,055 --> 00:58:04,932
I don't know. It's up along there somewhere.

874
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:07,973
You were there the night I knocked
Chicago Molly down, weren't you?

875
00:58:08,055 --> 00:58:11,365
You knocked her down?
I was the one that knocked her down.

876
00:58:11,815 --> 00:58:15,774
Yeah, that's right. He knocked her down.
But I was the one to start kicking her.

877
00:58:16,055 --> 00:58:18,091
- Here's the funnel.
- Okay.

878
00:58:18,735 --> 00:58:20,885
I starts kicking her in the midriff.

879
00:58:21,655 --> 00:58:25,011
Did you ever kick a woman
in the midriff that had a pair of corsets on?

880
00:58:25,095 --> 00:58:27,814
No, I just can't recall
any such incident right now.

881
00:58:27,895 --> 00:58:31,968
Why, I almost broke my great toe.
I never had such a painful experience.

882
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:33,727
MAN 1: Did she ever come back again?

883
00:58:33,815 --> 00:58:37,603
I'll say she came back. She came back
a week later and beat the both of us up.

884
00:58:39,135 --> 00:58:41,490
Yeah, but she had another woman with her.

885
00:58:42,615 --> 00:58:44,685
An elderly lady with grey hair.

886
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:46,652
<i>I had those two tough guys beat her up.</i>

887
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:49,573
Sheriff, come out from behind that bar.
You're not wanted here.

888
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:52,374
You're crazy. I'm wanted for
in nearly every state in the Union.

889
00:58:52,455 --> 00:58:53,490
Come on.

890
00:58:55,415 --> 00:58:56,609
[Milton ululating]

891
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:09,652
We must all act together if we are ever to rid
this town of Badger or any other lawbreaker.

892
00:59:09,735 --> 00:59:12,329
Something's got to be done
about this masked outlaw.

893
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:14,053
Unless we can catch him red-handed...

894
00:59:14,135 --> 00:59:17,013
or can someway learn his identity,
there's not much we can do.

895
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,734
I know someone who can identify
the Masked Bandit.

896
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,732
Explain yourself, Mrs. Gideon.

897
00:59:21,815 --> 00:59:25,012
- I don't wish to injure anyone's reputation.
- I'm sure you don't.

898
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:29,054
But Flower Belle, the Sheriff's wife,
has an intimate acquaintance with him.

899
00:59:29,135 --> 00:59:30,454
- What's that?
- Yes.

900
00:59:30,535 --> 00:59:33,129
She was asked to leave Little Bend
on account of him.

901
00:59:33,215 --> 00:59:35,490
Of course, she claims
she never saw his face, but...

902
00:59:35,575 --> 00:59:36,610
That's possible.

903
00:59:36,695 --> 00:59:39,732
But it is known he visited her
in her own room.

904
00:59:40,055 --> 00:59:42,523
So everybody in Little Bend believes that...

905
00:59:42,615 --> 00:59:45,766
Well, you know.
What else can everyone believe?

906
00:59:45,895 --> 00:59:48,125
I'm inclined to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

907
00:59:48,215 --> 00:59:51,013
However, I will agree to keep
an accurate check on her activities.

908
00:59:51,095 --> 00:59:52,084
I suggest...

909
00:59:53,335 --> 00:59:54,324
Another thing.

910
00:59:54,415 --> 00:59:57,725
Your name was brought up at
the Vigilante Committee meeting last night...

911
00:59:57,815 --> 01:00:00,727
in connection with the masked outlaw
who's been robbing the stages.

912
01:00:00,815 --> 01:00:01,850
In what connection?

913
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:05,245
A person said that you've been well
acquainted with him for some time...

914
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:06,814
that you actually know who he is.

915
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:09,170
I don't know who he is. I wish I did.

916
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:11,969
Nobody believes me. I hope you do.

917
01:00:12,295 --> 01:00:14,855
- I was just beginning to like you.
- I believe you.

918
01:00:15,415 --> 01:00:17,326
LEM: Mr. Carter?
CARTER: What is it, Lem?

919
01:00:17,415 --> 01:00:20,248
- Miss Foster's fainted again.
- Who's Miss Foster?

920
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:22,286
She's the lady that's teaching school.

921
01:00:23,175 --> 01:00:25,291
Come on. Let's see what we can do for her.

922
01:00:28,215 --> 01:00:31,844
What's this, Miss Foster? Aren't you taking
the job a little too seriously?

923
01:00:32,215 --> 01:00:35,525
I guess it upsets me too much,
when the boys get unruly.

924
01:00:36,055 --> 01:00:37,966
Wet a towel and put it on her head.

925
01:00:41,175 --> 01:00:42,767
Go back to your books, boys.

926
01:00:49,015 --> 01:00:52,007
Don't let them get you upset.
It's your nerves, you need a rest.

927
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,448
[Furniture crashing]

928
01:00:54,175 --> 01:00:57,531
You hear that? It gives you an example
of what she's got to put up with.

929
01:00:57,615 --> 01:01:01,494
- I better go dismiss the class for the day.
- No, that's what they're hoping you'll do.

930
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:04,533
I'll take over the class.
I'll show you how to handle them.

931
01:01:04,615 --> 01:01:06,287
But I wouldn't think of imposing.

932
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:08,605
I'll give them learning they never got before.

933
01:01:10,575 --> 01:01:12,691
Boys! Quiet!

934
01:01:13,135 --> 01:01:14,363
[Boy whistles]

935
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:21,574
This is Miss Flower Belle. She'll teach you
your lessons for the rest of the day.

936
01:01:27,255 --> 01:01:28,768
Boys, stand up.

937
01:01:30,415 --> 01:01:31,689
Sit down.

938
01:01:33,775 --> 01:01:34,764
Very good.

939
01:01:35,455 --> 01:01:37,366
That's your first lesson in discipline.

940
01:01:37,655 --> 01:01:39,213
I demand obedience.

941
01:01:43,255 --> 01:01:47,043
Boys, education's a great thing.
I don't know what I'd do without mine.

942
01:01:48,175 --> 01:01:51,372
Knowledge ain't so easy to get.
You got to work hard and study.

943
01:01:51,455 --> 01:01:52,683
I'm still studying.

944
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:56,165
Of course, I don't study the same things
you do, but it's a good idea.

945
01:01:56,775 --> 01:01:59,414
Now, history. A very fascinating study.

946
01:01:59,495 --> 01:02:01,406
In fact, it's my favourite reading.

947
01:02:02,935 --> 01:02:04,163
What's your name?

948
01:02:06,135 --> 01:02:07,124
Lem.

949
01:02:07,215 --> 01:02:09,604
Lem, tell me,
what do you know about Cleopatra?

950
01:02:10,055 --> 01:02:11,693
Gosh, teacher, I ain't seen her.

951
01:02:11,975 --> 01:02:14,330
Of course, you ain't.
She's a historical character.

952
01:02:14,415 --> 01:02:16,371
She lived way back in the early times.

953
01:02:16,655 --> 01:02:19,533
What a time she had.
She used to fool around with snakes.

954
01:02:19,815 --> 01:02:21,089
You mean, rattlesnakes?

955
01:02:21,175 --> 01:02:24,645
These snakes didn't rattle, they crooned.
She was the Queen of Egypt.

956
01:02:24,735 --> 01:02:26,293
I seen Little Egypt once.

957
01:02:27,295 --> 01:02:30,765
They ain't related. Sit down.
By the way, what are you doing here, Pop?

958
01:02:30,855 --> 01:02:33,415
Never had time to learn reading
and writing up to now.

959
01:02:33,495 --> 01:02:36,373
Carried a musket in '61.
Fought in Chickamauga and Bull Run, I did.

960
01:02:36,495 --> 01:02:38,213
You did? That's fine.

961

<i>Any questions?</i>

962
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:45,248
We was doing arithmetic on the blackboard
when Miss Foster took sick.

963

Arithmetic?

964
01:02:50,215 --> 01:02:52,490
I was always pretty good at figures myself.

That will be enough of that.

968
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:00,967
Now this example is...

969
01:03:01,055 --> 01:03:04,934
what is known as addition,
or putting two and two together.

970
01:03:05,175 --> 01:03:08,212
BOY 1: Why, teacher?
FLOWER: You said "Why?"

971
01:03:08,815 --> 01:03:09,930
Yes, teacher.

972
01:03:10,255 --> 01:03:13,850
That's what I thought you said,
and that's a very good question, too.

973
01:03:14,895 --> 01:03:19,047
Addition is when you take one thing
and add it to another and you get two.

974
01:03:19,215 --> 01:03:22,844
Two and two is four and five will get you 10,
if you know how to work it.

975
01:03:23,335 --> 01:03:26,054
Anyway, it all adds up in the end...

976
01:03:26,535 --> 01:03:29,208
and that, my dear young man, is addition.

977
01:03:30,095 --> 01:03:32,655

978
01:03:33,335 --> 01:03:34,324
Subtraction.

979
01:03:36,055 --> 01:03:37,374
That's very simple.

980
01:03:37,455 --> 01:03:41,334
For instance, a man has $100
and you leave him with $2.

981
01:03:42,015 --> 01:03:43,607
Boy, that's subtraction.

982
01:03:45,495 --> 01:03:48,805
I'm only gonna do this once,
so everybody pay attention.

983

- What's wrong with it?

BOY 1: Eight and seven are 15
and nine are 24. Not 31.

I was just trying to trap you. Smart boy.

988
01:04:07,735 --> 01:04:09,566

What is this? Propaganda?

992
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:32,733
I wonder what would happen
if you moved that one over there.

993
01:04:42,975 --> 01:04:46,012
I see. It's just an experiment, that's all.

994

- You are in.

995
01:04:53,935 --> 01:04:56,210
I thought you might enjoy
one of my pies, Sheriff.

996
01:04:56,295 --> 01:04:59,605
- This is the one I baked especially for you.
- Thank you.

997
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:02,843
- Is this the raspberry?
- No, it's the gooseberry.

998
01:05:03,615 --> 01:05:06,687
I was used to getting the raspberry.
I was beginning to enjoy it.

999
01:05:06,775 --> 01:05:08,333
A little tart.

1000

I won't keep you from your work, Sheriff...

1001
01:05:10,455 --> 01:05:13,731
but sometime when your duties permit,
I'd enjoy having you to tea.

1002
01:05:13,815 --> 01:05:16,568
Tea, yes, fine, I'd like that.

- Let us say sometime.

01:16:16,575 --> 01:16:19,487
What's this thing doing here?
It's ruining my necktie.

1170
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,931
Who's going to pay for my laundry?

1171
01:16:22,095 --> 01:16:23,494
Have you anything to say?

1172
01:16:23,575 --> 01:16:25,770
Yes, this is going to be a great lesson to me.

1173
01:16:25,855 --> 01:16:29,006
You villain. I advise you to make your peace
for the hereafter.

1174
01:16:29,095 --> 01:16:32,053
I'm not thinking of the hereafter.
I'm thinking of the present.

1175
01:16:32,135 --> 01:16:35,844
- Have you any last wish?
- Yes, I'd like to see Paris before I die.

1176
01:16:36,495 --> 01:16:38,008
Philadelphia will do.

1177
01:16:39,575 --> 01:16:42,487
TWILLIE: Vote for Cuthbert J. Twillie
for Sheriff.

[Dramatic instrumental music]

1179
01:16:55,655 --> 01:16:58,089
FLOWER: Don't move, any of you.
You either, Carter.

1180
01:16:58,175 --> 01:17:01,531
FLOWER: You trigger-brains can see
for yourself he ain't the man you want.

1181
01:17:01,615 --> 01:17:03,287
You wouldn't believe me when I told you.

1182
01:17:03,375 --> 01:17:05,491
You'd rather hang an innocent man
than take my word.

1183
01:17:05,575 --> 01:17:08,248
CARTER: While you're talking,
the man we want is getting away.

1184
01:17:08,335 --> 01:17:10,246
Don't let that worry you.
Open up them bags.

1185
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:15,487
MAN: Look at that.

1186
01:17:15,735 --> 01:17:18,295
FLOWER: There's enough there
to build a school, a church...

1187
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:20,809
or anything else
this town needs to make it civilized.

1188
01:17:20,895 --> 01:17:23,204
That's what you've been hoping for, ain't it?

1189
01:17:23,295 --> 01:17:26,287
Now, if any of you want
to take out after that bandit, go to it.

1190

[Dramatic instrumental music continues]

1192
01:17:48,855 --> 01:17:51,494
CARTER: I want to thank you personally
for what you've done.

1193
01:17:51,575 --> 01:17:55,329
CARTER: Not only for righting a wrong,
but for helping us build for the future.

1194
01:17:55,415 --> 01:17:57,167
Civilization's a great thing.

1195
01:17:58,855 --> 01:18:00,891
I'm sorry, Flower Belle.

1196
01:18:00,975 --> 01:18:03,205
That's all right, honey. You did your best.

1197
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,048
[People murmuring]

1198
01:18:11,135 --> 01:18:13,091
So, you're not married, after all?

1199
01:18:13,215 --> 01:18:16,685
- No, I'm as single as the day I was born.
- Great.

1200
01:18:17,535 --> 01:18:20,368
Now I can ask you something
I've wanted to for a long time.

1201
01:18:20,615 --> 01:18:21,889
I can even ask you to be my...

1202
01:18:21,975 --> 01:18:24,330
BADGER: Excuse me for interrupting, Carter.

1203
01:18:24,815 --> 01:18:28,330
I know what you were going to say,
but I'm afraid you're a little too late.

1204
01:18:28,415 --> 01:18:29,768
What do you mean?

1205
01:18:29,855 --> 01:18:32,528
Just a minute, boys.
You got me all confused.

1206
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:35,853
- I like the both of you.
- But you can't marry both of us.

1207
01:18:36,255 --> 01:18:37,893
I know. That's the trouble.

1208
01:18:38,535 --> 01:18:40,810
You've got to give me
a little time to think it over.

1209
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,123
How much time?

1210
01:18:42,695 --> 01:18:46,210
Maybe tomorrow. Maybe never.

1211
01:18:47,335 --> 01:18:49,895
But don't let that keep you
from coming around.

1212
01:18:50,415 --> 01:18:54,488
Any time you got nothing to do
and lots of time to do it, come up.

1213
01:19:04,495 --> 01:19:07,293
FLOWER: You leaving, honey?
TWILLIE: Yes. Goodbye, beauty.

1214
01:19:08,495 --> 01:19:12,249
I wanna give you back your wedding ring.
Guess I won't need it anymore.

1215
01:19:13,295 --> 01:19:16,014
Thanks. Maybe some other time.

1216
01:19:16,095 --> 01:19:19,531
- Yeah. I'll keep you on my wedding list.
- Thank you.

1217
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:23,884
I have to hurry back East
to attend to some oil wells I have there.

1218
01:19:23,975 --> 01:19:27,411
- Oil wells?
- Yes, hair oil wells.

1219
01:19:31,455 --> 01:19:32,729
What a man.

1220
01:19:34,415 --> 01:19:36,690
If you get up around the Grampian Hills...

1221
01:19:37,535 --> 01:19:39,924
you must come up and see me sometime.

1222
01:19:42,175 --> 01:19:44,370
I'll do that, my little chickadee.
