00:00:58,968 --> 00:01:02,364
This infernal machine!

3
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:04,767
I appreciate your spending
your Sunday fixing it.

4
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:08,337
Better than another
Sunday in an empty house.

5
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:11,574
You know me circumstance.

6
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:14,679
Ain't going to lie to you.

7
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:16,480
What would you do

8
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:17,981
if you were married to a woman

9
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,284
whose heart was for another?

10
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:25,390
It's a big world,
Mr. Toole.

11
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:32,266
Ah, Eva's me wife.
I'm making me stand.

12
00:01:33,116 --> 00:01:35,637
Hold on.

13
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:40,295
Thanks.

14
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:42,578
Mr. Durant is

15
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:43,812
Yeah.

16
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:45,828
His train is at council bluffs.

17
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:47,963
He could be here as soon as tonight.

18
00:01:51,137 --> 00:01:53,505
More reason to get this
machine fixed by tomorrow

19
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,074
so we can finish the bridge.

20
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:57,811
Show how valuable you
are to the railroad.

21
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,852
He's going to know you had a hand
in raising this bridge, too.

22
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:04,822
I'm not so sure.

23
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:08,359
Shall I see you later?

24
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:11,730
When I fix the engine.

25
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,801
Right.

26
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,551
Durant's on his way back.

27
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:26,721
[Grunts]

28
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:29,956
I can finish up here if you
want to get back to town.

29
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,424
That's what I'd do.

30

Any fool know that.

35
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,871
Ain't you got somewhere to be?

36
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:26,243
Not on the lord's day.

37
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,148

clodhoppers with

43
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:45,634

Hell, you gonna do it, do it right.

49
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:06,959
You got to lay in
a second wall of rock,

50

52
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,223
I'll take 3, too.

Come on. Get up.

57
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:37,832

Don't go too far.
We love taking your money.

That bast-- that bastard
Durant is back.

63
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:53,548
He'll be looking for the
payment for his land parcels.

64
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:57,385
Durant? Really?

65
00:04:57,452 --> 00:05:00,019
So, pay him.
Back to me game.

66
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:03,893
I need my cut from this place.

67
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,927
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm a bit short.

68
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:11,200
Bad run of luck.
[Chuckles]

69
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:13,803
And drinking up the rest, no doubt.

70
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:17,607
Ma was right.
You're a shambles,

71
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:19,677
just like dad.

72
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:26,053
I'm the proprietor here.

73
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:27,421
This is my place of business.

74
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:28,721
Our place of business.

75
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:30,491
I stuck my neck out
floating a land parcel

76
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,794
for Mr. Ferguson for it.

77
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:33,298
Come on. I know
you have money.

78
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,700
What do you got on you?

79
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:38,407
No, Sean. You're embarrassing me.
Stop it.

80
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,810
I'll do worse than that if
you're holding out on me.

81
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:46,651
We'll see.

00:06:02,568 --> 00:06:04,703
Oh, and thank you for...

[Grunts] All you've
done these past weeks.

87
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:14,678
Now, it's time to go take care
of that husband of yours.

88
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:17,179
At least let me
walk you to the office.

89
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:21,885
I should be seen making my way to
the office under my own steam.

90
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:25,056
Oh, uh...

91
00:06:33,905 --> 00:06:35,340
Please, take it.

92
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:38,711
And...

93
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:42,379
If you ever need anything for
yourself or your child...

94
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:44,616
Thank you,
Mr. Durant.

95
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:54,433
Good-bye.

00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:34,101
And those are his personal ledgers.

102
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:36,470
Yes, Mrs. Bell.
That is true.

103
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:39,470
I was gathering them
under direct orders.

104
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:42,539

109
00:08:06,032 --> 00:08:08,200
[Breathing heavily]

110
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:34,789
Mr. Durant!

111
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:38,261

Ahh.

113
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,067
What are you up to, McGinnes?

114
00:08:47,673 --> 00:08:49,675
Nothing at all, sir.

115
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,350
I...

116
00:08:57,857 --> 00:09:02,291
Whatever happened to
the magic lantern show?

117
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:05,996
Oh, well, my brother and I
manage the pleasure house now.

118
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:07,665
And we're partners in the saloon.

119

Magic lantern show in
Chicago. [Chuckles]

121
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,340
Two men caught a tiger under a barrel.

122
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:20,974
Great story.

123
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:26,044
The two young men were
devoured by the tiger.

124
00:09:28,382 --> 00:09:30,381
Think about it.

125
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,822

You're back early.

00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,691
About wore out that damn steam engine.

140
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:50,725
So, no bridge.

All right.

142
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:55,597
For your sins, you will

144
00:10:57,765 --> 00:11:00,001
Your wife?

145
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:02,440
Don't look so horrified.

146
00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:04,841
Oh, and wear a clean shirt.

147
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:08,610

Look how good this hearth draw, huh?

154
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,698
door, roof.
Practically done.

155
00:11:40,337 --> 00:11:42,903
Toole going to kill Eva and the baby,

156
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:45,804
if the baby come out like me.

157
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:50,276
Look here. That ain't going to happen.
Hear me?

158
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:51,711
Who going to stop it?

That's who.

161
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:58,879
You'll be the best
father for that baby,

162
00:11:58,947 --> 00:12:00,280
far as I can tell.

163
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:02,947
How you mean?

164
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,553
He'll be mixed.
Mulatto.

Whatever you wanna say.
He'll be like you, right?

166
00:12:11,658 --> 00:12:14,289
Yeah, I suppose.

167
00:12:14,357 --> 00:12:17,124
Who be better for him, hmm,

168
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:20,361
than somebody just like him?

169
00:12:22,563 --> 00:12:24,565
I ain't never thought
about it like that.

170
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:29,403
See, you'd be his father.

171
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,970
And I'd be his uncle Psalms.

172
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:32,604
[Laughs]

173
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:35,076

like them buildings.

178
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:47,823
Some of them are,
like, 6 stories tall.

179
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:50,993
You should see the buildings
in New York--twice that.

180
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,833
Me brother lives in a
building 10 stories tall.

181
00:12:57,268 --> 00:12:59,202
Would you take me to New York?

182
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:01,036
Of course.

183
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:06,471
Well, depending on...
You know.

184
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:08,174
What?

185
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:10,478
The baby.

186
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:13,911
You mean, when the
baby's fit to travel?

187
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:21,051
Just say what you're thinking.

188
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:26,518
If the baby's born white, Eva,

189
00:13:26,585 --> 00:13:28,421
then we can meet me family.

190
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:30,956
Well, see, I thought...

191
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:33,422
You said that you'd put
that aside, Mr. Toole.

192
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,690
Me brother wouldn't.

193
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,625
In the saloon, the men are wagering

194
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,360
whether the baby will be
born white or...

195
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:46,266
Something else.

196
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:51,938
Shall we leave this place?

197
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:56,643
Maybe.

198
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,282
It's a big world, after all, isn't it?

199
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:07,786
[Indistinct talking]

200
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,492
All right.
You ready?

201
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,135
[Grunts]

202
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:21,104
Oh, it's going to be
a wonderful evening.

203
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:23,040
I'm sure you'll adore them.

204
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:26,676
As for your flaxen-haired
maiden of the west...

205
00:14:26,744 --> 00:14:28,311
Fair-haired
maiden of the west.

206
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:30,978
Just like most of your enthusiasms.

207
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:34,285
I understand. She's
attractive and capable.

208
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:37,423
And very smart.

209
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,226
And that makes her very dangerous.

210
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:42,927
Do you think she may have
deciphered our mileage from--

211
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:45,028
They--
here they are.

212
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:48,030
Here you are.
Come in. Come in.

213
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:52,198
Ahh. Mr. Bohannon. Pleased
to make your acquaintance.

214
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,465
Same here, ma'am.

215
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:55,602
Now, you'll come right over here

216
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,639
and sit on my right.
[Clears throat]

217
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:00,373
Lily,
forgive me, I--

218
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,373
Mrs. Bell.

219
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:02,976
Mrs. Bell,
please.

220
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:04,145
Andrew.
Yes?

221
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:05,846
Close those shades and shut the door

222
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:07,047
and see that we're not disturbed.

223
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,449
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:38,842
[Distant animal cries]

225
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:46,785
Thank you, Andrew.

226
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:48,488
Well, bon appetit.

227
00:15:48,555 --> 00:15:50,888
So...

228
00:15:50,956 --> 00:15:54,159
Tell me where you're
from, Mr. Bohannon.

229
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:55,594
Meridian, Mississippi.

230
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:58,132
Oh. Is yours
a cotton family?

231
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,036
Was.
Ain't nothing left.

232
00:16:01,104 --> 00:16:02,371
Of course.

233
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:04,707
Thomas, didn't we know someone

234
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:06,943
with the railroad in meridian?

235
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:09,745
Is there a railroad
there, Mr. Bohannon?

236
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:13,785
Yes, ma'am, mobile and Ohio had a
railhead there before it burned.

237
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:15,386
Leonidas Tate.

238
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,588
Yes, Leo Tate.

239
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:20,992
He had shares in credit
mobilier, didn't he?

240
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,729
We used to summer with
the Tates in New York,

241
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:25,530
on long island sound.

242
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:29,833
I doubt Mr. Bohannon
is interested in our, uh,

243
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,703
sailing stories with
the Tates. [Chuckles]

244
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:43,245
Matter of fact,

245
00:16:43,313 --> 00:16:46,046
I married Mr. Tate's
youngest daughter Mary.

246
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:50,751
It was there at Christ church.

247
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:53,252
Well, small world.

248
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,785
Well, tell us, how is she?

249
00:16:57,324 --> 00:16:59,457
She's dead.

250
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,500
The war took her.

251
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,067
Oh.

252
00:17:15,312 --> 00:17:21,450
Did your family know
Richard McLemore, then?

253
00:17:21,518 --> 00:17:23,455
He and my grandfather laid
the very first spur line

254
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:24,891
in Lauderdale county.

255
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,893
God, Bohannon,

256
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:29,763
I just might send you to
New York one of these days

257
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:32,466
to deal with the board
on my behalf. Ha!

258
00:17:32,534 --> 00:17:35,136
Unless memories of the
city would be too painful.

259
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:39,376
Well, my eyes are set west
to the future, Mr. Durant.

260
00:17:39,444 --> 00:17:40,578
I think you know that about me, too.

261
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:43,916
[Grunts]
Well said, Mr. Bohannon.

262
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:47,621
Well, this has been lovely,

263
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:49,757
but I must go.

264
00:17:49,824 --> 00:17:52,627
I'm so sorry.

265
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:55,664
All this talk of the railroad
must have been so boring for you.

266
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:59,203
Not at all. After all, my future
is bound to the railroad also.

267
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:03,042
Of course. It's very tragic,
what happened to your husband.

268
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:04,944
Well, it's just good
we could provide you

269
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:07,146
with some employment, in the meantime.

270
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:08,713
In the meantime.
Until you decide

271
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:10,848
where you're going to
reestablish yourself,

272
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,983
someplace more conducive.

273
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:17,352
Of course.
Thank you.

274
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,354
I'll walk you to your car.

275
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:23,188
There's no need,
really. Good night.

276
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:25,723
Good night.
Good night--Mrs. Bell.

277
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,191
I'll accept that offer,
Mr. Bohannon,

278
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:30,860
seeing as though my husband
is still enjoying his brandy,

279
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:32,528
aren't you, dear?

280
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:34,662
Yes, of course.
[Chuckles]

281
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,431
You should know that
Mrs. Bell has been

282
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:40,100
very important to the railroad.

283
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:42,171
She's done a lot to get us this far.

284
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:45,208
Does that include
sleeping with my husband?

285
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,710
I--

286
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:50,480
I ain't around much.

287
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,348
You ain't.

288
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,784
Why do you hide your
breeding, Mr. Bohannon?

289
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:59,154
Oh, I guess I just got used to
traveling low to the ground.

290
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,955
[Laughs]

291
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:02,791
Regarding Mrs. Bell,

292
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:04,960
my husband is making some changes.

293
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:08,164
Is Mr. Durant
firing her?

294
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:11,167
Be careful with whom
you align yourself.

295
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:15,371
My husband believes you have
a future on the railroad,

296
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,811
and I do, too.

297
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:19,879
Yeah?

298
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:24,384
You hardly know me.

299
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:26,389
Hmm.

300
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,992
Yes, but my instincts...

301
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:31,628
Are always right.

302
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,836
Good night,
Mr. Bohannon.

303
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:38,072
Good night.

304
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:52,131
[Indistinct talking]

305
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:54,135
Lily...

306
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:57,308
Mr. Bohannon.

307
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,218
[Grunts]

308
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:08,884
We need to dis--

309
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,099
we need to discuss your
progress on my bridge.

310
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,171
Mrs. Bell has an estimate. I
think we should ask her opinion.

311
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:17,605
I'm asking yours.

312
00:20:17,673 --> 00:20:20,241
Two weeks.

313
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:21,877
If the weather holds
and we work Sundays.

314
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:24,014
Not good enough.
One week.

315
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:26,249
We're dangerously behind schedule.

316
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:29,018
Whose schedule would that be?

317
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:30,754
Yours, Mr. Bohannon.

318
00:20:30,822 --> 00:20:33,359
It was on your advice

319
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:35,861
that we decided to bridge
the gorge at this point.

320
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:37,429
Yes, sir. And we made
good time, considering.

321
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:39,597
Considering what,
Mr. Bohannon?

322
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:42,870
Indians. Strike.
Wash-out.

323
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:46,074
All I need is a structure

324
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:48,077
that will support a locomotive

325
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:50,114
from one side of
the gorge to the other.

326
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:52,451
Understand?

327
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,955
I'll, um...

328
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:04,125
I'll drive it across
the bridge myself.

329
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:06,362
How about that?

330
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,877
[Water pours]

331
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,084
Can we speak in private?

332
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:29,822
Yes.

333
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,863
Got something for you.

334
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:46,535
It's a Claddagh ring.

335
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:48,204
From home.

336
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:50,739
You're offering it to me?

337
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:53,541
I mean, I'm a successful businessman,

338
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:55,677
and you're starting
in your church--

339
00:21:55,745 --> 00:21:57,280
I thought when you gave me
the land for the church,

340
00:21:57,348 --> 00:21:58,782
it came with no strings attached.

341
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,383
These aren't strings, Ruth.

342
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:02,018
It's a token of my affection.

343
00:22:02,085 --> 00:22:04,954
Proposing marriage, Sean?

344
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:08,694
It's how
you wear it. Um...

345
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:11,562
On your right hand,

346
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:15,067
pointed toward your wrist means...

347
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:16,870
Your heart is captured.

348
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,081
I would like you to
wear it like that for me.

349
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:26,953
Ahh...

350
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:28,653
It's a bit small.

351
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,260
But I'll keep it, Sean.

352
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:35,129
And you will think about it?

353
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:41,505
I just need a little time.
This is all so fast.

354
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:45,274
Of course.

355
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:48,548
With your father's death,
and then, your church...

356
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:51,286
Take your time.

357
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:54,356
I'll find a ring that fits better.

358
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:56,192
Good-bye.

359
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:05,446
[Indistinct shouts]

360
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:11,254
Hey!

361
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:13,556
Let's get into position like
we went over this morning.

362
00:23:13,623 --> 00:23:14,957

them braces, all right?

would have been glad

that I had been flattened.

401
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,037
No. I was worried
about you.

been more careful, then.

Don't blame me for
your failures, Bohannon.

It's not my fault you blew the engine.

you oversold our mileage

I was worried you weren't
being provided for.

424
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,371
Where did you go?

425
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:13,138
Into the long country.

426
00:27:13,205 --> 00:27:15,773
I prayed and fasted.

will be, a Cheyenne.

No, you are a baptized Christian.

Ruth, after I became a Christian,

430
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:25,785
I killed my brother, and
I killed your father.

431
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:31,526
I broke my father's heart,

432
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:34,563

I didn't come here for your pity.

435

I came here to bring you food,

436

to tell you while I was hunting,
I saw the white spirit.

437

I don't believe in ghosts, Joseph.

438

Your father was right.

This is a bad place.

440
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,091
You should leave.

I can't leave.

You're not naive, lily.

471
00:29:48,964 --> 00:29:53,067

I have work to do.

that Mr. Durant died,

00:33:31,546 --> 00:33:34,282
and as far as you can see
in either direction.

547
00:33:34,351 --> 00:33:36,851
Mr. McGinnes and me,
we have an arrangement.

548
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:39,820
There are only two ways
to leave this railroad.

549
00:33:39,888 --> 00:33:41,921
You die in my employ,

550
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:45,625
or you walk back
through Indian territory.

551
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,460
[Groans]

552
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:52,163
Back to whatever squalid slave
shack from which you came.

553
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:55,167
This ain't right.
It ain't right.

554
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:56,703
[Sighs]

555
00:33:56,771 --> 00:34:01,374
If the sun rises on your
sorry ass in the morning,

556
00:34:01,441 --> 00:34:05,313
I will have you shot for trespassing.

557
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,580
Is that what you want?

558
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,583
What you just tore up,

559
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:13,350
that's what I want.

560
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,319
I want to build me a house
down by that river,

561
00:34:16,386 --> 00:34:19,121
where I can lock
my damn door at night.

562
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:24,192
Know that that's my damn house.

563
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,096
And my damn property.

564
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:28,397
And I can shoot any damn man
that comes through that door

565
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:31,298
and tell me it ain't mine.

566
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:35,434
I ain't afraid to work,
Mr. Durant,

567
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:38,705
but I ain't gonna be your
damn nigger no more.

568
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:42,908
What I want is some respect.

569
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:45,511
And if I got to take it
out of your damn hide,

570
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:50,380
or anybody else's, I will.

571
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:58,024
Mr. Ferguson.

572
00:34:58,092 --> 00:34:59,827
Have a seat.

573
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,401
Please.

574
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:07,169
[Knock on door]

575
00:35:09,604 --> 00:35:12,943
Oh. Did I come
at a bad time?

576
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:17,280
No, I--I was just
resting.

577
00:35:17,347 --> 00:35:20,449
Thomas told me you had words.

578
00:35:20,516 --> 00:35:21,950
He did?

579
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:24,687
There are no secrets between us.

580
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:27,791
You were not a surprise to me.

581
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:30,626
I see.

582
00:35:30,694 --> 00:35:32,295
I told him that I thought he was wrong

583
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,132
to speak to you in that way.

584
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,770
You've been very instrumental

585
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:37,438
in the building of the railroad.

586
00:35:37,506 --> 00:35:39,807
And if it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't have stayed afloat

587
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,775
during Thomas' recovery.

588
00:35:44,113 --> 00:35:45,213
Thank you.

589
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:47,215
That's why what I am going to ask you

590
00:35:47,282 --> 00:35:48,816
is so difficult.

591
00:35:48,884 --> 00:35:51,887
In light of Thomas' injuries

592
00:35:51,955 --> 00:35:55,156
and his nightly discomfort,

593
00:35:55,224 --> 00:35:59,161
well, it's just not possible
for us to share a bed.

594
00:35:59,228 --> 00:36:02,960
[Sighs]

595
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,465
You want me to leave my train car.

596
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:09,568
I need suitable accommodations.

597
00:36:09,636 --> 00:36:13,639
I'm sure you understand.

598
00:36:15,043 --> 00:36:17,412
I have nowhere else to go.

599
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:20,849
You're a smart girl.

600
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:23,254
You seem to know your way around.

601
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:26,731
I'm sure you'll find something.

602
00:36:32,497 --> 00:36:33,999
[Sighs]

603
00:36:48,385 --> 00:36:50,588
[Sighs]

604
00:36:56,112 --> 00:36:58,579
[Lily sighs]

605
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:06,005
You don't have to leave.

606
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:09,058
I've seen how you fare in the tents.

607
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,978
Can't build another floorboard.

608
00:37:12,215 --> 00:37:14,482
That's not funny.

609
00:37:14,549 --> 00:37:16,165
I know it ain't.

610
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:18,014
You know, you could stay.

611
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:21,054
Thomas already knows.

612
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:24,789
No, he only thinks he does.

613
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:28,360
Yeah, well, he's right.

614
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:33,431
Lily...

615
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:35,066
You shouldn't test a man

616
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:38,168
who's jealous or afraid
for his livelihood.

617
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:39,569
Especially not when he's both.

618
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:42,039
Hey.

619
00:37:42,909 --> 00:37:45,545
Don't want to test a man.

620
00:38:06,627 --> 00:38:09,162
[Owl hooting]

621
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,564
[Door opens]

622
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:20,246
Sean:
Is it true?

623
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:22,345
[Breathing heavily]

624
00:38:22,615 --> 00:38:25,115
Sean, you can't be here.

625
00:38:26,183 --> 00:38:30,557
I need to know if it's true.

626
00:38:31,493 --> 00:38:33,394
You've been drinking.

627
00:38:42,538 --> 00:38:44,170
Did you?

628
00:38:44,237 --> 00:38:46,704
Sean, you're scaring me.

629
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:49,139
Joseph.

630
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:56,145
Did you and he...

631
00:38:56,213 --> 00:38:58,548
Don't.

632
00:38:58,615 --> 00:39:03,017
People say you had relations.

633
00:39:03,086 --> 00:39:04,888
People lie.

634
00:39:04,955 --> 00:39:08,923
Mickey saw you together.

635
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:13,230
What do you want from me?

636
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:16,030
I want the truth.

637
00:39:16,097 --> 00:39:17,764
Get out.

638
00:39:17,832 --> 00:39:22,103
I want the truth!

639
00:39:26,641 --> 00:39:30,746
And I thought it was me you wanted.

640
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:43,998
You have to go.

641
00:39:45,936 --> 00:39:48,304
Please go.

642
00:40:00,325 --> 00:40:01,858
[Door closes]

643
00:40:23,742 --> 00:40:25,912
[Indistinct chatter]

644
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:41,057
[Glass breaking]

645
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:07,046
This ain't no boarding house.

646
00:41:09,783 --> 00:41:13,588
From the looks of it,
it ain't even a house.

647
00:41:18,795 --> 00:41:23,537
What happened, Durant kicked you
out of your fancy railroad car?

648
00:41:23,604 --> 00:41:25,970
Something like that.

649
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:29,477
[Scoffs]

650
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:30,979
What about you?

651
00:41:31,046 --> 00:41:34,717
You get tired of building
your dream house?

652
00:41:40,987 --> 00:41:43,821
Something like that.

653
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:51,826
Might as well.

654
00:41:58,464 --> 00:42:02,902
You ought to know, Mr. Durant
offered me a new job.

655
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:04,601
Oh, yeah?

656
00:42:04,669 --> 00:42:08,571
Yeah.

657
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:12,071
He want me to do something

658
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:16,075
I'm sure you ain't gonna like at all.

659
00:42:17,377 --> 00:42:19,344
What's that?

660
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:25,815
[Laughs]

661
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:33,587
What'd you tell him?

662
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:37,455
Told him I'd think about it.

663
