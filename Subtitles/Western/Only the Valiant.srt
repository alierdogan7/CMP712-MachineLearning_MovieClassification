1
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:25,888
My name is Joe Harmony.

2
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:28,901
This is my stamping ground.

3
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:31,665
I'm a scout for the Army.

4
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:35,401
Had my work cut out for me
for a long time.

5
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:39,769
Behind that pass

6
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:43,441
there is the whole 'Apache nation.

7
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:46,213
They used to come
swarming out of that pass

8
00:01:46,286 --> 00:01:49,119
killing everything in sight.

9
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:52,124
Then we built a fort.

10
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:54,990
Fort Invincible.

11
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:58,792
Plugged up the pass
just like a cork in a bottle.

12
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,062
Things was fine for a while.

13
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:08,036
But them 'paches is pretty smart.

14
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:12,545
One day the bottle blew
the cork plum apart.

15
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:34,320
Just as I figured.

16
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:36,191
That's Tucsos.

17
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:37,662
He's the boss of all the Apaches,

18
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:39,699
the fella that started
this whole business.

19
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:41,700
You step aside, Corporal.

20
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:43,565
The Army doesn't shoot prisoners, Joe.

21
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:44,831
I'm a civilian.

22
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:48,068
We'll take him back
to Fort Winston with us.

23
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:51,338
You crazy?
This ain't no common injun.

24
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:54,073
He's just about as near to a god
as a fella can get.

25
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:56,707
If you shoot him now,
things will quiet down.

26
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:58,273
Without Tucsos stirring them up,

27
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:00,114
the rest of them injuns
would get reasonable

28
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:01,915
just as fast as they can.

29
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:03,148
If you take him in alive,

30
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:05,657
you'll have every Apache
in the territory coming after him.

31
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,056
We had three years of this.

32
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:08,754
You can stop it right now.

33
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:11,456
We'll take him back to Winston, Joe.

34
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,893
Suit yourself, Dick.

35
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:17,394
Come on.

36
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,246
- Lieutenant Underwood.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:28,975
Detail the men
to return to Fort Winston.

38
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:31,313
Have them inform Colonel Drumm
that we're bringing Tucsos in.

39
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:32,373
Yes, sir.

40
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:33,885
And put a burial detail to work.

41
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:36,445
I want this place looking like
a cavalry post before we leave.

42
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:37,649
Yes, sir.

43
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:42,219
That's all he ever cares about:

44
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,286
Leave it looking neat.

45
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:50,193
Cavalry post.

46
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:05,078
Atten-hut!

47
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,452
Eyes... right!

48
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:31,841
Present arms!

49
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:36,341
Send the prisoner over to the guard
and dismiss the detail.

50
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,940
Yes, sir.

51
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:40,213
Detail dismount!

52
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:45,654
I tell you, I ain't never
saw the likes of it.

53
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:47,192
Mike, rack that up for me.

54
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,490
There were 16 million Indians.

55
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:51,689
16 million of them, I tell you!

56
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:55,565
And they're running through that pass
like a bunch of crazy jackrabbits.

57
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:57,569
Oh, stop that noise.

58
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:59,730
And right there stands this fella Tucsos,

59
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:00,898
waiting to be shot.

60
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:02,635
Just waiting to be shot!

61
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,040
And what does our captain do?

62
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,772
He says, "Men, I want
this place cleaned up

63
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:10,179
and looking like a cavalry post
the first thing you do!"

64
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,444
And that's all he said.

65
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:14,282
By golly, it's enough
to drive a man to drink.

66
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:19,053
This is the last time I ever
go anyplace without this.

67
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:22,759
Did he have any orders
to go through the pass

68
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,729
or to shoot Tucsos?

69
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:26,129
How do I know?

70
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,030
Well, if he didn't, he wouldn't.

71
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:30,228
Orders was made to be broke, Rutledge.

72
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:32,601
Not with Captain Lance.

73
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:34,902
I ought to know that
better than anybody.

74
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:51,446
What's the matter with Saxton?

75
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,116
Oh, that one.

76
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:56,585
He's tired of tooting his bugle.

77
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,187
Wants a carbine.

78
00:06:58,264 --> 00:06:59,822
You should have seen
the poor lad up there.

79
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:00,991
Shaking in his boots he was.

80
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,466
It was his first time.

81
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:04,503
Ah, first time.

82
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:06,471
I know all about that.

83
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,666
Listen, you either got it,
or you ain't got it,

84
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:10,141
and he ain't got it.

85
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,370
No, sir.

86
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:19,808
Why, you...

87
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:21,911
Did you want
to say something?

88
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:23,182
No.

89
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:24,188
Good.

90
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:25,849
Two cards, please.

91
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:30,328
- Hello, Captain Lance.
- Mrs. Drumm.

92
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:31,363
The Colonel's in his room.

93
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,126
Thank you.

94
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,223
Colonel.

95
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:37,361
Sit down, Captain.

96
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:38,768
Thank you, sir.

97
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,298
So you got him, Richard.

98
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,808
And they're all dead up there...

99
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:45,902
Selden, all of them.

100
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:46,968
Yes, sir.

101
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:48,775
That's horrible.

102
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:50,247
It can be worse.

103
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:52,341
There have been a few times
in my life, Richard,

104
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:54,943
when I regretted having to obey orders.

105
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:56,886
This is one of them.

106
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:59,516
I almost wish you'd
killed Tucsos up there

107
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:02,083
instead of bringing him in.

108
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:05,962
As it is, you saw these settlers
on the parade ground.

109
00:08:06,032 --> 00:08:08,193
They've been coming in
for three or four days now,

110
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:10,463
looking for protection,

111
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:12,971
but it's blasted little protection they've got.

112
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,371
We're under-strength.

113
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:19,605
The relief column won't be here
for at least ten days.

114
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:24,514
They're sending 400 men,
which is enough to handle anything.

115
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:28,315
But if the Apaches make
a sortie to free Tucsos,

116
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:31,619
as they undoubtedly will,

117
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:34,285
this can be another Fort Invincible.

118
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:42,258
We've got to get Tucsos
up to Fort Grant right away.

119
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:43,962
The first thing tomorrow morning.

120
00:08:44,037 --> 00:08:45,299
Yes, sir.

121
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:48,534
Have the adjutant
write out orders for a detail.

122
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:52,704
I'Il... I'll leave it in your hands
to choose an officer and...

123
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:58,580
and have him...

124
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:00,585
Will you please go now, Captain?

125
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:04,212
Dad?

126
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,587
No, thank you, dear.

127
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:07,819
- Bill?
- No, thanks.

128
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:09,122
I'll answer it.

129
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:12,658
Hello, Dick. Come in.

130
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:14,427
I was wondering where you were.

131
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,235
I got the same treatment, Dick,
so don't feel too proud.

132
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:22,740
I gather it was pretty grim at Invincible.

133
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:25,775
It was pretty grim.

134
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:27,005
What do you think happened?

135
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,310
Selden forget to put out
pickets once too often?

136
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:32,442
No. Tucsos cut off their water supply.

137
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:33,951
All he had to do then was wait.

138
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,488
That's a smart one, that Apache.

139
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:37,545
How about a little whiskey, Dick?

140
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:38,852
No, thanks, sir.
Not right now.

141
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:40,654
Come on, Dick, have one.
It'll relax you.

142
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:41,989
Besides, it tastes mighty good.

143
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:43,995
I'll bet it does,
but I got work to do tonight.

144
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:45,587
That's the trouble with you,
Richard Lance.

145
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:46,996
You're always working.

146
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,693
Do this, do that.

147
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,531
10,000 things to do.

148
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:52,195
And when you finally
get around to me,

149
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:53,671
it's for three minutes.

150
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,037
If Bill treated me like that...

151
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:57,042
If Bill was a captain
and I was a lieutenant,

152
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,340
he could make out the reports
and I could get here first.

153
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:01,573
Thanks. I like everything
just the way it is.

154
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:04,310
Not that you can't come and visit us
when Cathy and I are married, but...

155
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:06,011
Bill, don't talk like that.

156
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:08,383
Haven't I told you?
I'm going to propose to you tonight.

157
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:11,149
See? I got here first.

158
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:12,657
I asked for the pleasure
of the company

159
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:14,784
of the beautiful daughter
of Captain Eversham.

160
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:16,158
Lo and behold, I got it,

161
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:18,459
so I'll thank you not
to make any overtures.

162
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:19,657
Don't worry, Dick.

163
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:21,563
I'll see that they don't stay out too late.

164
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:22,794
To tell you the truth, Ed,

165
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:24,894
I'm going to get a lot of sleep
tonight anyway.

166
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:26,268
Why?

167
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,069
I'm taking Tucsos up to Fort Grant
first thing in the morning.

168
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:31,167
- No.
- Who wished that on you?

169
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:32,438
The Army.
Who do you think?

170
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:35,242
That's a mighty dangerous detail
the way things are.

171
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:38,580
It's not as dangerous
as keeping him around here.

172
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:40,642
Now, the beautiful daughter
of Captain Eversham,

173
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,847
that is why I have to sleep tonight.

174
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:45,254
Good night, Cathy.
Good night, Bill.

175
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:46,758
Good night.

176
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:49,954
Dick, will I see you before you go?

177
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,792
If you get up real early.

178
00:10:57,904 --> 00:10:59,633
Dick.

179
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:05,274
You're enough to drive a woman insane,

180
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:07,438
running off like that.

181
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:09,606
Show me how much
you're gonna miss me.

182
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:15,847
That'll take a lot of showing, Cathy.

183
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:18,322
No, it wouldn't. Try.

184
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:35,407
That's how much I'm gonna miss you.

185
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:39,070
You better stop or I'll go over there
and shoot Tucsos and never leave at all.

186
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:41,443
I'd like that.

187
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,474
Good night, Cathy.

188
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:56,360
- Hey, Simpson.
- Yeah.

189
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:57,555
- Calhorn.
- Right.

190
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,224
- You're on a patrol tomorrow. 5:30.
- How nice.

191
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,096
I thought you'd like it.

192
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:03,965
Where's Kebussyan?

193
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:06,835
Probably tagging along
after Lieutenant Holloway.

194
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:09,374
I suppose you're right.

195
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:13,806
Thanks, Gilchrist.

196
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,144
I've done nothing for you, Murdock.

197
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:18,376
You brought Tucsos back.

198
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:21,545
Lance is taking him back
to Fort Grant tomorrow.

199
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:22,713
You going with him?

200
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:24,154
What do you think?

201
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:27,488
Well, the country's beautiful
this time of year, Mr. Murdock.

202
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,656
Be just as easy if the whole patrol
committed suicide tonight.

203
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:34,791
Save the Apaches a lot of trouble.

204
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:38,394
And if Lance don't wanna shoot himself,
I'll be glad to do it for him.

205
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:41,031
I wouldn't mind having
that pleasure myself.

206
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:42,506
But I'll say one thing.

207
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:45,043
If there's anybody can take
Tucsos up to Fort Grant,

208
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:46,305
it's Captain Lance.

209
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:48,845
I hate his black heart, too,

210
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:51,179
but he's still the best officer
I ever served under.

211
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,683
Didn't the captain
really wanna shoot him?

212
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:54,811
- Well, he...
- Sure.

213
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:57,651
But he wants to do it
all neat and proper,

214
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,350
according to regulations.

215
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:02,394
The way he should have shot you, Onstot.

216
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:06,330
Except deserters get hung,
unless they're lucky.

217
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:27,449
Hi, Dick.

218
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,509
Hi, Joe.

219
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:31,088
Thought you'd be in bed.

220
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:33,557
I've got too much to do.

221
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,924
I don't like what
you're gonna do tomorrow.

222
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:37,519
I don't like it at all.

223
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:39,827
Neither do I, but it's gotta be done.

224
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,366
I'm telling you straight.

225
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:45,564
Any detail leaves here with Tucsos
maybe ain't gonna come back.

226
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:47,003
I just rode out a couple hours.

227
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:48,938
Them hills is full of Apaches.

228
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:51,067
I could feel 'em.

229
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:53,044
They'll be coming after him.

230
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:54,841
Well, I got my orders.

231
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:57,178
I figured that's what you'd say.

232
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:01,183
I'll walk a piece with you.

233
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:21,869
I've gotta be getting back, Bill.

234
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:24,341
You still haven't answered me.

235
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,844
Yes, I have, by not answering.

236
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:28,744
You mean it's no.

237
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:33,343
Dick's the one?

238
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:38,082
How long have you known it?

239
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:39,624
I don't know.

240
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:41,592
I do.

241
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:44,459
I guess I always have.

242
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,794
You know, when I think of your future,

243
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:48,731
I tremble.

244
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:49,961
Why?

245
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:52,231
He'll beat your children
and break your heart.

246
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:53,431
Every day?

247
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:54,700
Every single day.

248
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:56,366
Wonderful!

249
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:59,309
Yes, he will be wonderful, Cathy.

250
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:01,642
Has he asked you yet?

251
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:03,181
Not yet.

252
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:05,513
Do you know what he's gonna do
when you say yes?

253
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:07,416
No, what?

254
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:11,150
This.

255
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:25,430
Good night, Joe.

256
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:26,596
See you in the morning, Dick.

257
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:35,580
Lance, I was over in your quarters
looking for you.

258
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:37,582
The Colonel wants to see you.

259
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,410
Where's Holloway?

260
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:43,148
Courting.

261
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,150
Come in.

262
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:54,766
- Good evening, Captain.
- Mrs. Drumm.

263
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:55,960
If you'll excuse me.

264
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,662
You sent for me, sir?

265
00:15:57,737 --> 00:15:59,466
I certainly did, Richard.

266
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,438
What do you think you're doing?

267
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:02,667
Sir?

268
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:07,406
I told you to assign an officer to the detail
that is taking Tucsos back.

269
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,005
I didn't say assign yourself.

270
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,379
You didn't say not to, sir.

271
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,977
I thought you'd have
more sense than that.

272
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:17,921
You know we've got
nothing but a cadre here.

273
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,457
And you should know if you don't

274
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:24,121
that you're the only officer
I have any faith in.

275
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:28,633
I'm a sick man, Richard,
despite what Jennings tells me.

276
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:31,101
I'm in no position to handle the post.

277
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,934
You're the only person here
I can depend on.

278
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:37,066
I don't want you taking
Tucsos up to Fort Grant.

279
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:39,236
Too many lives depend
on your being here.

280
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:40,836
Well, the orders are out, sir.
You can't change...

281
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:42,744
I can change any orders I ever gave,

282
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:45,443
and I'm changing those right now.

283
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:51,880
I want you to wake up the adjutant
and tell him to put Lieutenant Holloway

284
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:55,916
in charge of the detail
that is taking Tucsos back.

285
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:57,462
Holloway?

286
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,430
He's a good man, isn't he?

287
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:01,796
Well, yes, sir,
he's one of the best, but...

288
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,131
Then he's the officer
commanding the detail.

289
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:05,500
I've never argued with you
about an order bef...

290
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:07,937
Then don't argue with me now, Captain!

291
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:09,975
That's the way I want it.

292
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:14,839
Yes, sir.

293
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:17,246
Anything else?

294
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:19,147
That's all, Richard.

295
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:25,924
- Lance...
- Save it.

296
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:28,482
The minute they started,
we knew we had 'em.

297
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:31,155
And it was a slaughter.

298
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,165
High watermark
of the Confederacy, they called it.

299
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:36,360
Come in.

300
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:40,269
Hello, Dick.
Not asleep yet?

301
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,273
You're taking over the Tucsos detail, Bill.

302
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:43,330
I'm sorry.

303
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:46,008
You're joking.

304
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,774
I wouldn't joke about a thing like that.

305
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:51,214
No, of course you wouldn't.

306
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:57,249
Looks like tonight's my unlucky night.

307
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:00,720
That's funny.

308
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:04,251
First time I remember an order
being changed around here.

309
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,321
Like rewriting the Bible.

310
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:09,664
Well, it's the one time I don't mind
making it easy on the captain.

311
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:11,669
Do I, Cathy?

312
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:15,138
And I guess I'm the one
who needs sleep now.

313
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:17,107
Good night, Cathy.

314
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:18,404
- Dick.
- Good night, Bill.

315
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:19,944
Good night.

316
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:34,292
Dick.

317
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,386
That was a cruel thing to do.

318
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:39,556
Cruel?

319
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:42,260
Why did you do it?

320
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:43,767
Why?

321
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:48,897
I don't know what you're
talking about, Cathy.

322
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:51,135
You're not fooling me.

323
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,576
I've lived in an army post all my life.

324
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:55,807
Dad's right.

325
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:57,644
Orders don't get changed
unless someone goes

326
00:18:57,716 --> 00:19:01,618
to an awful lot of trouble to change them.

327
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:05,054
Cathy, believe me,
it's just the way things are.

328
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:06,648
I was planning to go myself.

329
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:09,159
Until you saw Bill kissing me,

330
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,662
and then you went
directly to Colonel Drumm.

331
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:15,358
I never...

332
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:17,095
Cathy.

333
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:19,262
I don't know what it's all about,
Dick, but whatever it is...

334
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:20,771
Well, good night.

335
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:41,515
Prepare to mount.

336
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:44,355
Mount.

337
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:48,427
Good luck, Bill.

338
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:50,867
Thanks, Dick.

339
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:51,994
Good luck, Joe.

340
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:53,333
Back to you, Dick.

341
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:55,965
Forward... ho!

342
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:20,953
He's been standing at that wall
the last three nights.

343
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:22,118
Wonder when he sleeps.

344
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:24,219
What makes you think he can?

345
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,690
Halt! Who goes there?

346
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:05,226
Corporal of the guard!
Post number three!

347
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:17,415
I brought back a friend of yours.

348
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:19,348
Bill Holloway.
What's left of him.

349
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,245
Put him in the guardhouse.

350
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,930
You done a wrong thing, Dick.

351
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:13,198
Wanna take a look?

352
00:23:16,508 --> 00:23:18,203
Just as well.

353
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:23,114
Bill.

354
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,854
Joe.

355
00:23:37,162 --> 00:23:39,289
- Take care of him, soldier.
- Yes, sir.

356
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:43,527
Aren't you going to
tell me how it happened?

357
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:46,264
I guess you've got a right to know.

358
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:49,398
They jumped us about three hours
after we left here.

359
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:53,434
Me and them two soldiers only got away
'cause we was riding rear guard.

360
00:23:53,512 --> 00:23:55,412
They took Bill alive.

361
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:57,949
Me and the two soldiers rode circles
the next three days,

362
00:23:58,016 --> 00:23:59,881
trying to catch up with 'em.

363
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:03,444
He was headin' back here
this afternoon when we found him.

364
00:24:03,522 --> 00:24:05,547
Was he still alive?

365
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:08,320
I guess you might call it alive.

366
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:12,489
They was sending him back
deliberate as a warning.

367
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:14,998
When are those 400 men coming?

368
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:16,091
Another week.

369
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:17,362
That's what I figured.

370
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:19,199
I didn't think Tucsos
would be sending us a warning

371
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:22,604
unless he was dead certain
he could wipe us out.

372
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:27,134
Now he's gotta get even with us
for capturing him.

373
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:29,612
My guess is they're
up there behind a pass

374
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:32,377
beatin' their war drums right now.

375
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:34,817
Is that a guess or is that a sure thing?

376
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:38,482
I lived with the Chiricahuas
for ten years.

377
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:41,617
You can learn a lot
about injuns in ten years.

378
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:43,786
When do you think he's coming?

379
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:45,796
That's hard to say.

380
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:48,196
Might be three days, might be less.

381
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:51,998
Only thing sure, he ain't gonna wait
for that relief column to get here.

382
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,507
Another thing's for sure,
Tucsos got a look at this place.

383
00:24:56,575 --> 00:24:58,440
Right this minute,
he knows our strength

384
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,909
better than the sergeant major.

385
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:04,342
Let me know what you decide, Dick.

386
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,974
Thanks, Joe.

387
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:11,546
Captain Lance, they want you
back at the gate, sir.

388
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:17,922
I'm sorry about Lieutenant Holloway, sir.

389
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:19,554
There wasn't a finer officer.

390
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:21,565
We know what he was to you.

391
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:24,302
Thank you.

392
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,768
He was a good officer and a good man.

393
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:33,368
And I say the Army ain't
got too many like that.

394
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:39,975
Give me a hand
with these boots, Rutledge.

395
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:42,316
If it wasn't for Lance,
Holloway would still be alive,

396
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:44,582
and he'd be dead.

397
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:46,749
That's what's wrong with the Army.

398
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:49,089
The wrong guys always get killed.

399
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,828
First time in four days
those toes have seen daylight.

400
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:59,166
Yeah, I'm gonna miss
Lieutenant Holloway.

401
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:02,469
That's a lot of talk, Murdock.

402
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,304
If the truth were known,

403
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:07,345
you're probably glad
that Holloway got killed.

404
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:10,074
It just gives you another chance
to apply for a commission.

405
00:26:10,148 --> 00:26:13,709
I'll never get a commission
as long as Lance is around.

406
00:26:13,785 --> 00:26:17,744
And would you say that was
his fault or your fault?

407
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:20,883
Or maybe they were afraid
they might not find another sergeant.

408
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,824
Shut your mouth, you dirty Reb.

409
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:26,630
Well, I'll say this much for the captain.

410
00:26:26,698 --> 00:26:29,098
He can tell the difference
between a soldier and a tramp,

411
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,067
and if you can do that,
you're a good officer.

412
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:32,330
I'll leave it up to you, Rutledge.

413
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:33,393
You went to West Point.

414
00:26:33,472 --> 00:26:35,133
And Lance had him kicked out.

415
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:37,767
Well, is it Lance's fault
if Rutledge does something,

416
00:26:37,843 --> 00:26:39,743
and is foolish enough
to get caught at it?

417
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:40,800
Rutledge must love him.

418
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:42,710
He come way out here
to serve under him.

419
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:45,272
Sure, that's what it is, love.

420
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,649
You're all sore because he knows you
for what you really are:

421
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,984
A bunch of flea-bitten bellyachers.

422
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:53,081
And you talk about bellyaching.

423
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:55,718
What did you do when the captain
took away your liquor ration?

424
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:58,695
What did I do?
Well, I quit drinking.

425
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:02,959
I'm just wanna ask you one question.

426
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:07,836
Suppose you found yourself in a dark alley
one night with Captain Lance.

427
00:27:07,906 --> 00:27:09,271
What would you do?

428
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:11,206
What would I do?

429
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:13,039
I'll tell you what I'd do.

430
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:16,080
I'd sneak up behind him,
and I'd put up my hand

431
00:27:16,148 --> 00:27:18,514
and grab him by the throat,
and I'd whirl him around,

432
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:22,212
and I'd say, "Captain,
have you got a drink on you?"

433
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:27,487
Spit and polish, that's all he is.

434
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:29,424
If it ain't in the books, it's wrong.

435
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:32,395
Get him in a bad spot and he'd run.

436
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:36,594
Yeah, run just like a dirty Reb.

437
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:39,762
You no good, dirty
son of a Yankee mule.

438
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:41,305
Come on down, Rebel.

439
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:44,137
I came out here to fight injuns,
not sergeants.

440
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:46,575
You come out here because
you were sent from a Union prison.

441
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:47,577
Well, what about it?

442
00:27:47,646 --> 00:27:49,546
Then you deserted after you got here.

443
00:27:49,614 --> 00:27:53,015
You'd still be running if Lance hadn't
have caught you and brought you back.

444
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:54,609
That's right, I would.

445
00:27:54,686 --> 00:27:58,087
Are you coming down, Rebel?

446
00:27:58,156 --> 00:28:00,920
I got no call to fight with you, Sergeant.

447
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:03,086
What, I gotta drag you down?

448
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:05,322
Let it alone, Murdock!

449
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:08,331
Leave me up on my feet.

450
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,129
Why don't you get up, Onstot?

451
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:13,467
Murdock, you wanna
twist somebody's leg?

452
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:15,233
I ain't occupied for the next few minutes.

453
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:17,332
Use mine.

454
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:19,843
If Lance had hung you,
I could forgive him a lot.

455
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:21,071
Kebussyan!

456
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,042
Where's that Arab?

457
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,677
The captain threw him
in the guardhouse.

458
00:28:28,754 --> 00:28:29,914
Ain't you heard him yellin'?

459
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:31,080
No, I ain't.

460
00:28:31,156 --> 00:28:32,453
The crazy gorilla.

461
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:33,923
He can't stand the guardhouse.

462
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:36,051
Just makes him crazier.

463
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:39,029
Burial formation for
Lieutenant Holloway in 40 minutes.

464
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:41,861
Any man missing gets
three hours latrine duty.

465
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:45,266
You got it?

466
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:46,565
Yeah, sure. Sure.

467
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:48,435
All right, hop to it.

468
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:52,639
Load!

469
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:54,975
Aim! Squad!

470
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:56,810
Fire!

471
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:00,752
Aim! Squad!

472
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:02,377
Fire!

473
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:04,422
Order arms!

474
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:39,055
"Man dieth and wasteth away.

475
00:29:39,124 --> 00:29:41,957
"Yes, man giveth up the ghost,

476
00:29:42,027 --> 00:29:43,619
"and where is he?

477
00:29:43,695 --> 00:29:47,222
"Though the root thereof
wax old in the earth,

478
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:51,133
"and the stock thereof
die in the ground.

479
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:54,263
"Yet, through the scent
of water, it will bud

480
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:58,935
"and bring forth boughs like a plant.

481
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,502
"As the waters fall from the sea,

482
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:05,778
"and the flood decayeth and dryeth up,

483
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:11,153
"so man lieth down and riseth not

484
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:14,215
"till the heavens be no more,

485
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:17,193
"they shall not awake,

486
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:21,722
nor be raised out of their sleep."

487
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:46,714
All right.

488
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,725
Let's take Harmony's word for it.

489
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:51,660
Let's assume Tucsos is going to attack.

490
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,358
That means he'll do it
before the relief column gets here.

491
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:56,559
And that way,
we don't stand a chance.

492
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:59,968
Before he attacks, he'll have to
assemble west of the Flintheads.

493
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:02,632
That means he'll have to come
through the pass to get here,

494
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:04,902
so I'd like to take a patrol
out to Fort Invincible

495
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:06,307
and try and hold him off up there.

496
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:09,176
No, I can't spare you, Richard,
and I can't spare the men.

497
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:11,340
I only need a small patrol,
six or seven men.

498
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:12,974
Six or seven men?

499
00:31:13,051 --> 00:31:14,518
Tucsos will have hundreds.

500
00:31:14,586 --> 00:31:18,078
He can still only get through
that pass a few at a time.

501
00:31:18,156 --> 00:31:21,250
It didn't look so invincible last time
you were up there, did it?

502
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:23,351
The way I figure it,
you can hold Invincible

503
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:25,919
with a small party,
but only for a short time.

504
00:31:25,997 --> 00:31:29,194
If I can hold Tucsos off up there
until a relief column gets here,

505
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:30,461
we'll be out of trouble.

506
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:32,799
What about the water supply up there?

507
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:35,499
Well, we can carry enough
to last two or three days.

508
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:37,565
If we're up there any longer than that,

509
00:31:37,642 --> 00:31:39,610
we won't be needing any.

510
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:41,009
When would you want to leave?

511
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,070
Right away.
Tomorrow morning.

512
00:31:43,148 --> 00:31:44,843
All right, Richard.

513
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,577
I guess it's that or nothing.

514
00:31:46,651 --> 00:31:48,482
I'll give you the best men
left on the post.

515
00:31:48,553 --> 00:31:49,986
I'd rather pick 'em out myself, sir.

516
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:51,545
Certainly, take anyone you want.

517
00:31:51,623 --> 00:31:53,386
Have the adjutant write out the orders.

518
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:54,482
Thank you, sir.

519
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,325
I... I want to apologize for my attitude

520
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:00,455
last time we spoke.

521
00:32:00,532 --> 00:32:02,727
I wasn't myself.

522
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:05,167
Well, I'm glad to see
you looking better, sir.

523
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:09,037
It's merely the calm
before the storm, I'm afraid.

524
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:10,665
Good night, Richard.

525
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:12,801
Good night, sir.

526
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:17,473
I'm... I'm sorry about Holloway.

527
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:19,244
Well, I guess he knows that.

528
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:26,256
All right, kids.
Gather round. Gather round.

529
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:27,552
What's the good word tonight?

530
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:28,923
Read it and you'll see.

531
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,995
Excuse me, gentlemen.

532
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:41,436
"The following enlisted men
will form at 5:40 AM,

533
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:45,567
"fully equipped for a combat patrol
to be commanded by Captain Lance.

534
00:32:45,644 --> 00:32:48,306
"First Officer, Troop A, Fifth Cavalry.

535
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,749
"Senior Sergeant Murdock,
Corporal Gilchrist,

536
00:32:52,817 --> 00:32:56,514
"Trooper Kebussyan,
Trooper Onstot,

537
00:32:56,588 --> 00:33:00,046
"Trooper Rutledge,
Trumpeter Saxton.

538
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:03,026
"Second in command will be
First Lieutenant Winters,

539
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:05,722
"J. Harmony will act as scout.

540
00:33:05,797 --> 00:33:08,664
By order of Colonel Drumm."

541
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:10,792
- Well, that lets me out.
- Me, too.

542
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:13,303
Let's get back to the card game.

543
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:15,703
That's a mighty ugly body of men.

544
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:18,368
Looks like he picked the men
he hated the most.

545
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:21,640
Or the ones who hated him the most.

546
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:24,511
I don't figure it. Why me?

547
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:25,844
Why any of us?

548
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:30,752
Well, now, what are all you old hens
clucking about this time?

549
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:31,948
You ain't seen this order.

550
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:34,992
No, my little hero,
I ain't seen this order.

551
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,156
But I can see this board, I'll bet ya,
just about as good as anybody.

552
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:46,697
He must figure I'm having
too good a time around here tonight.

553
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:50,366
Wants to get me away someplace
where it's dry as boot leather.

554
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:52,467
T'aint no matter how dry it is...

555
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:53,636
if you're dead.

556
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:55,304
I ain't gonna be dead.

557
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,780
I'm coming back.

558
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:01,216
Like Holloway, maybe?
I hope.

559
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:06,181
Say, the Arab's still in the guardhouse.

560
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:09,317
You reckon he's gonna
turn him loose to go with us?

561
00:34:09,394 --> 00:34:12,989
If I ever put him in the guardhouse,
I'd never take him out on patrol.

562
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:17,965
Let me out!
Let me out!

563
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:20,664
Let me...

564
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,468
You gonna keep this up all night?

565
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,475
Let me out, effendi.

566
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:27,408
So you can kill the captain?

567
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:33,141
So I can kill the captain.

568
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:34,981
I don't mind you doing it, Arab,

569
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:37,851
but you gotta do it on your own time.

570
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:40,288
Let me out.
Let me out!

571
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:43,191
Get me... out!

572
00:34:57,876 --> 00:34:59,867
Corporal of the guard,
post number eight!

573
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:03,703
What's the matter?

574
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:05,875
Look what that loco Arab done.

575
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:10,450
I wouldn't have believed it.

576
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:12,490
Well, I got orders to let him out anyway.

577
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:13,489
He's on patrol tomorrow.

578
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:14,752
Just as well.

579
00:35:14,826 --> 00:35:16,794
I don't think he likes it in there.

580
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:18,556
No, I guess not.

581
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:23,697
All right, Arab.
Come on. Get out.

582
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:27,534
You're on patrol tomorrow morning
with Captain Lance.

583
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:30,073
He asked for you especially.

584
00:35:33,878 --> 00:35:35,368
He asked for me?

585
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:36,744
That's right.

586
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:47,119
So, he asked for Trooper Kebussyan.

587
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:50,093
So...

588
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:53,562
he meet a trooper named Death.

589
00:35:53,631 --> 00:35:55,622
Don't do nothing that'll get you back here.

590
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,635
We gotta keep this
guardhouse in one piece.

591
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:02,764
There's always time.

592
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:04,934
Always place.

593
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:13,909
Think he'll do it?

594
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:15,350
Probably.

595
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:21,151
What do you want?

596
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:22,420
I have to talk to you, Cathy.

597
00:36:22,494 --> 00:36:24,826
There's something I want to tell you.

598
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:28,024
There's nothing you have to say
that will do any good.

599
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:29,930
Not after what you've done.

600
00:36:31,803 --> 00:36:34,931
And I wouldn't want to listen to anything
that you might have to say.

601
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:40,109
You probably want to
tell me you're sorry,

602
00:36:40,178 --> 00:36:43,636
that you didn't mean what you did.

603
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:46,479
Or perhaps you're gonna say it
wouldn't happen again.

604
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:51,955
Maybe you want another chance.

605
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:58,228
Or were you gonna say
that love made you do it?

606
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:04,529
Well, you're not gonna
say anything to me.

607
00:37:04,602 --> 00:37:07,730
Not about love or Bill or what has been

608
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:11,798
or will be or what might have been...

609
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:14,538
because I'm not gonna listen.

610
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:18,673
Because, to me,
you're as dead as Bill is.

611
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,310
More dead...

612
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:23,377
because I'm gonna remember him.

613
00:37:24,889 --> 00:37:27,449
I've put you out of my heart.

614
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:33,994
Do you hear me?

615
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:36,829
Now leave me alone.

616
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:38,994
Get out of here.

617
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,265
Get out!

618
00:37:55,353 --> 00:37:56,843
Dick...

619
00:38:10,635 --> 00:38:13,365
Jenny, you're an angel for doing this.

620
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:16,839
There'll be a reward in heaven
for girls like you.

621
00:38:16,908 --> 00:38:19,433
Well, there better be
a reward right down here.

622
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,070
There's only enough here to last me
three or four days, darling.

623
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:24,774
You know I'll be back
as soon as it's gone.

624
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:25,907
Will you?

625
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:27,975
Have I ever lied to you, Jenny?

626
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:29,041
Yeah.

627
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,644
Oh, Jenny.

628
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:34,021
You start talking like that,
and I'll think you don't love me anymore.

629
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:35,992
Bye, gotta go.
I gotta go.

630
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:38,853
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

631
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,296
Just one sip to point the way
for the rest of this.

632
00:38:45,703 --> 00:38:49,400
Now you be a good girl while I'm gone,
or I'll bash your pretty little head in for you.

633
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:51,237
Now give us a kiss.

634
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,745
Tis whiskey, not glory

635
00:38:55,813 --> 00:38:58,782
That makes a man happy

636
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,909
I'd trade all my medals...

637
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:11,725
Now, now, now.
None of that.

638
00:39:11,796 --> 00:39:13,855
Don't you worry your pretty little head.

639
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:15,296
I'll be coming back to ya all right.

640
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:16,799
Now give us a kiss.

641
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:18,631
That's better.

642
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:21,467
You just remember, darling,
I'll be thinking of you,

643
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:25,441
and only you,
every minute of the time.

644
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,603
Yes, every minute, darling.

645
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,941
Attention!

646
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:46,027
Prepare to mount.

647
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:49,958
Mount!

648
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:54,596
Forward... ho!

649
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:16,744
What about the cistern?

650
00:42:16,814 --> 00:42:21,376
Dry. Bone dry.

651
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:23,044
How about the acequia down below?

652
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,883
Busted.

653
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:28,221
You gonna tell the soldiers?

654
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:29,691
They'll find out soon enough.

655
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,751
If you say so.

656
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:34,229
I think I'll take a look
at the other side of the pass.

657
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:36,630
There's something I can't catch quite.

658
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:37,827
When he's coming.

659
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:40,496
That's what I can't catch.

660
00:42:40,571 --> 00:42:41,868
Sometime tomorrow, maybe.

661
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:45,067
Afternoon. Night.

662
00:42:45,142 --> 00:42:47,576
Maybe not till dawn the day after.

663
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:56,345
On the other hand, he might
show up an hour from now.

664
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,411
You start trying to calculate that fella

665
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:01,617
to do something at
the time you calculate,

666
00:43:01,692 --> 00:43:05,458
then's the time to figure
for just the opposite.

667
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:06,928
See ya, Dick.

668
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:22,471
Prepare to dismount.

669
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:23,638
Dismount!

670
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:29,953
Close it up.
Close it up.

671
00:43:37,595 --> 00:43:41,554
Gilchrist, take Kebussyan as a detail
and close the gate.

672
00:43:41,632 --> 00:43:44,999
Bring the ammunition
and put it up on the fire step.

673
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:48,527
Sergeant Murdock, I want you to locate
suitable quarters for all of us,

674
00:43:48,606 --> 00:43:50,836
and see that the spare
canteens and the packs

675
00:43:50,908 --> 00:43:53,638
are placed in whatever
quarters you choose for me.

676
00:43:53,711 --> 00:43:56,839
Also detail someone
to corral the horses.

677
00:43:56,914 --> 00:44:01,146
And Saxton, I want all calls sounded.

678
00:44:01,218 --> 00:44:05,712
Lieutenant Winters, you'll accompany me
on an inspection of the walls.

679
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,815
You have your orders.

680
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:09,655
All right, fall to.

681
00:44:11,696 --> 00:44:13,994
Just a minute, Onstot.

682
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:16,932
The horses seem to like you
better than any of the rest of us.

683
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:18,696
You take care of them.

684
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:26,276
Where you going with them canteens?

685
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:27,572
You heard the captain.

686
00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:28,839
Just leave mine be.

687
00:44:28,913 --> 00:44:30,972
I never saw you get so hot about water.

688
00:44:31,048 --> 00:44:32,879
Never mind what you never saw.

689
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,577
Give me my canteens.

690
00:44:34,652 --> 00:44:35,584
Gilchrist.

691
00:44:35,653 --> 00:44:38,850
I can take care of anybody
that questions my rank, Lieutenant.

692
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:40,652
You'll get the same
water ration as everyone else.

693
00:44:40,725 --> 00:44:43,626
Understand, Gilchrist?

694
00:44:43,694 --> 00:44:44,786
Yes, sir.

695
00:44:44,862 --> 00:44:47,854
Now get back to unpacking that horse.

696
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:51,199
Carry on, Sergeant.

697
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:52,599
Yes, sir.

698
00:44:59,844 --> 00:45:01,937
Well, that's one way to handle it.

699
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:05,380
He'd been drinking.
Gilchrist, I mean.

700
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:06,507
Water?

701
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:08,051
In this country?

702
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,945
You need any, you can
come around to my quarters.

703
00:45:12,023 --> 00:45:14,924
I'll take what you
ration the men, no more.

704
00:45:14,992 --> 00:45:15,981
Speaking of quarters,

705
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,460
you're entitled to share mine,
wherever they are.

706
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:20,156
I'll get by, thanks.

707
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:25,300
Suit yourself.

708
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:27,394
Let's take a look at these walls.

709
00:45:38,215 --> 00:45:41,150
Captain, this is mighty thirsty work.

710
00:45:41,218 --> 00:45:42,810
Most work is.

711
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:50,727
Now, to sum up, the wall's
in pretty good shape.

712
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:52,660
It'll stand up all right under rifle fire.

713
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:53,788
Yes, sir.

714
00:45:53,864 --> 00:45:56,594
After all, they can only come
through that pass a few at a time.

715
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:59,500
We can bring enough fire to bear
to take care of that situation.

716
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:04,030
Wasn't taken care of last time,
and there was half the troop up here.

717
00:46:04,108 --> 00:46:07,168
Well, maybe we got a couple
of tricks up our sleeves.

718
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:08,370
Captain Lance?

719
00:46:08,446 --> 00:46:10,971
Yes, Sergeant.

720
00:46:11,048 --> 00:46:12,777
Sir, I put the men in the old barracks.

721
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,909
They can fix the lean-to against the wall.

722
00:46:14,985 --> 00:46:17,283
Put Lieutenant Winters in the QM building.

723
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:18,480
Good work, Sergeant.

724
00:46:18,556 --> 00:46:21,821
And I figured the best place
for the captain was in the guardhouse.

725
00:46:23,427 --> 00:46:25,258
Very good, Sergeant.

726
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:27,126
Go there.
I'll join you directly.

727
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:31,228
You better get some rest.

728
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:33,065
I'm gonna take some men
up to the pass tonight.

729
00:46:33,137 --> 00:46:34,468
You'll be in command here.

730
00:46:34,538 --> 00:46:35,664
In command of what?

731
00:46:36,907 --> 00:46:38,374
The horses.

732
00:46:47,051 --> 00:46:48,040
Hey, Captain...

733
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:49,381
Yes, I know.
It's thirsty work.

734
00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:51,182
Mighty thirsty work.

735
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,657
Go easy with that.

736
00:47:00,064 --> 00:47:01,861
More of it in there.

737
00:47:01,932 --> 00:47:03,422
What is this stuff, Captain?

738
00:47:03,501 --> 00:47:07,096
I don't want anybody in here
unless I'm here, understand?

739
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:08,604
Yes, sir.

740
00:47:13,177 --> 00:47:16,374
There's something I'd like to discuss
with the captain, if he's got the time.

741
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:17,709
What is it, Sergeant?

742
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:19,373
There's a vacancy, sir.

743
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:23,216
On account of Lieutenant
Holloway being killed.

744
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:24,515
So?

745
00:47:24,588 --> 00:47:27,751
Well, sir, I'm the senior
non-commissioned officer in line...

746
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:30,157
Your application for commission's
been in three times.

747
00:47:30,227 --> 00:47:34,561
Each time I asked
that it be turned down.

748
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:37,533
I figured maybe you did it.

749
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:40,069
But seeing the way things are,

750
00:47:40,137 --> 00:47:44,233
you know, if anything should
happen to the captain,

751
00:47:44,308 --> 00:47:46,868
there ain't many of us
coming out of this.

752
00:47:46,944 --> 00:47:49,606
Maybe only one or two.

753
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,171
Maybe only one.

754
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:58,417
That's quite possible.

755
00:47:58,489 --> 00:48:00,923
But it'd be interesting
to see which one it is,

756
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:03,323
won't it, Sergeant?

757
00:48:06,864 --> 00:48:08,695
Sergeant?

758
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:12,826
I want a fatigue detail tonight.

759
00:48:12,903 --> 00:48:14,734
Half an hour after mess.

760
00:48:49,673 --> 00:48:54,940
Laddie, I've learned two things in my life.

761
00:48:55,012 --> 00:48:58,140
One of 'em is that you can't even up
a fingernail by biting it.

762
00:48:58,215 --> 00:49:00,581
And the other is that you can't
drink a quart of whiskey

763
00:49:00,651 --> 00:49:03,518
every day of your life
and stop it just like that.

764
00:49:03,587 --> 00:49:04,884
It ain't healthy.

765
00:49:04,955 --> 00:49:06,582
Every day of your life?

766
00:49:06,657 --> 00:49:08,090
Well, no, not quite.

767
00:49:08,158 --> 00:49:10,183
Just since I was three years old.

768
00:49:10,261 --> 00:49:12,456
Maybe you better
go back to water, hmm?

769
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:15,430
Water? That's for fish.

770
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:18,969
Go get me a new pick.
That one's dull.

771
00:49:19,036 --> 00:49:21,129
Yes, Corporal.

772
00:49:35,986 --> 00:49:38,011
The holes are drilled
for the dynamite, sir.

773
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:40,784
A couple here in the pass, and one
halfway between the pass and the fort.

774
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:43,349
You think you can handle
this stuff all right?

775
00:49:43,427 --> 00:49:44,519
Yes, sir.

776
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:49,222
You remember hearing them
tell us about it at the Point?

777
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:52,428
Yes, sir.

778
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:55,836
You've got a good memory, Rutledge.

779
00:49:55,906 --> 00:49:57,430
All right, take it.

780
00:50:12,956 --> 00:50:14,856
Turn that up a little brighter, Onstot.

781
00:50:14,925 --> 00:50:16,324
Yes, sir.

782
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:23,266
Captain, sir.

783
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:27,168
If you'll pardon the liberty, sir,
have you got a cigar I can have?

784
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:33,142
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

785
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,405
When's Joe Harmony coming back here?

786
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:36,969
When he's ready.

787
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:38,912
I suppose so.

788
00:50:38,982 --> 00:50:42,474
Hey, these things make you thirsty,
don't they, Captain?

789
00:50:42,553 --> 00:50:45,647
Well, don't smoke 'em, then.

790
00:50:45,723 --> 00:50:47,714
So far I can't do nothing
around this outfit.

791
00:50:47,791 --> 00:50:50,225
- Gilchrist.
- Yes, sir.

792
00:50:50,294 --> 00:50:51,921
The rest of us go back
to the fort tonight,

793
00:50:51,995 --> 00:50:54,020
you stay here on guard duty.

794
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:55,622
First shift.

795
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:57,929
If the Apaches should
put in an appearance,

796
00:50:58,001 --> 00:51:01,698
all you have to do
is touch off the dynamite.

797
00:51:01,772 --> 00:51:03,000
Yes, sir.

798
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:05,371
Me with a 20-year thirst.

799
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:06,568
Captain Lance.

800
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:08,474
What is it?

801
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:11,070
- Lieutenant Winters.
- I came up to relieve you.

802
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:13,207
Get back to the fort
or I'll put you under arrest.

803
00:51:13,283 --> 00:51:16,252
I'm tired of being put on the shelf by you.

804
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,346
Go on back.
I'll take over here.

805
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:22,187
You fool, you haven't even got
the strength to stand up straight.

806
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:25,319
You think I'm so sick,
why'd you bring me here?

807
00:51:25,396 --> 00:51:26,624
You're drunk.

808
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:31,500
- And what if I am?
- Where'd you get it?

809
00:51:31,568 --> 00:51:36,164
There's a whole river of it running
right through the middle of the fort.

810
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,572
Well, there won't be for long.

811
00:51:38,642 --> 00:51:39,700
Sergeant Murdock.

812
00:51:39,777 --> 00:51:41,540
- Yes, sir.
- Form the men.

813
00:51:41,612 --> 00:51:43,170
All right, pick up your equipment.

814
00:51:43,247 --> 00:51:46,375
- Rutledge. Rutledge.
- Yes, sir.

815
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,577
- Hurry it up.
- Be right down.

816
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:49,641
Fall in.

817
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,348
All right, look alive.
Get in there.

818
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:54,516
When we get back,
consider yourself under arrest

819
00:51:54,591 --> 00:51:55,922
and remain in your quarters.

820
00:51:57,795 --> 00:51:59,660
Look out!

821
00:52:09,907 --> 00:52:11,966
Come down here.

822
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:22,908
A thousand pardons, effendi.

823
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:24,317
The rock fell.

824
00:52:25,422 --> 00:52:27,788
It might've kill you.

825
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:31,520
It must've been the will of heaven.

826
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:38,401
You can see for yourself.

827
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:40,994
No man can move that rock.

828
00:52:41,071 --> 00:52:43,164
Get it out of the way.

829
00:52:44,174 --> 00:52:45,801
Alone, effendi?

830
00:52:45,876 --> 00:52:47,844
Get it out of the way.

831
00:53:03,927 --> 00:53:06,862
Get it out of the way
or I'll have you shot.

832
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,849
Now take your place.

833
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:42,555
All right, straighten it up.

834
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,792
You did that on purpose.

835
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:48,701
It was the will of heaven.

836
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:50,603
Detail, atten-hut.

837
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:52,972
Right face.

838
00:53:53,043 --> 00:53:55,341
Forward... harch.

839
00:54:00,284 --> 00:54:01,615
Jerry.

840
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:05,411
Thanks.

841
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:08,424
Go to the devil.

842
00:55:03,313 --> 00:55:06,077
More, effendi.
I'm big man.

843
00:55:06,149 --> 00:55:08,140
That's not my fault.

844
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,534
Hey, that ain't enough to wet my teeth.

845
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:27,467
You old enough to have teeth?

846
00:55:27,537 --> 00:55:29,027
Yeah, I'm old enough.

847
00:55:29,106 --> 00:55:32,269
Then you're old enough to get up
in the pass and relieve Gilchrist.

848
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:34,071
- Right now?
- Right now.

849
00:55:34,144 --> 00:55:35,372
He's done two hours.

850
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:37,379
He'll tell you what to do up there.

851
00:55:40,017 --> 00:55:42,815
You don't look thirsty.

852
00:55:42,886 --> 00:55:44,114
Rebs don't need water anyway.

853
00:55:44,187 --> 00:55:45,882
Give me some of that horse water.

854
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:48,423
Yeah.

855
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:51,655
Come to think of it,
it ought to suit a deserter.

856
00:56:00,103 --> 00:56:01,627
What about the extra canteens?

857
00:56:01,705 --> 00:56:03,502
Captain's saving them for tomorrow.

858
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:05,336
Sure ain't saving us.

859
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:14,481
Don't it seem funny to you
there's no news of Joe Harmony?

860
00:56:14,551 --> 00:56:15,950
Nothing seems funny to me.

861
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:17,077
It's because you got no imagination.

862
00:56:17,154 --> 00:56:19,952
- Maybe you got enough for both of us.
- Maybe I have.

863
00:56:20,023 --> 00:56:21,854
Got enough to be nervous anyway.

864
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:26,625
- How's the Lieutenant?
- How do I know?

865
00:59:33,283 --> 00:59:34,944
He put me out there to die.

866
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:36,781
That's why he gave me the carbine.

867
00:59:42,192 --> 00:59:44,092
Stay where you are.

868
00:59:47,163 --> 00:59:48,255
What's the trouble, Captain?

869
00:59:48,331 --> 00:59:50,765
Somebody fired a couple of shots in here.

870
00:59:50,834 --> 00:59:52,802
It was not I, effendi.

871
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:55,201
I have no carbine.

872
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:57,934
Are all the others accounted for?

873
00:59:58,008 --> 00:59:59,066
As far as I know, sir.

874
00:59:59,142 --> 01:00:00,074
Well, check on it.

875
01:00:00,143 --> 01:00:01,167
Yes, sir.

876
01:00:01,244 --> 01:00:03,371
I came to watch over you, effendi,

877
01:00:03,446 --> 01:00:07,314
see no harm come to you.

878
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:10,512
That was very thoughtful of you.

879
01:00:10,587 --> 01:00:11,952
Everything all right up at the pass?

880
01:00:12,022 --> 01:00:14,183
Yes, sir.
Saxton's on guard.

881
01:00:14,257 --> 01:00:15,349
You better tell him what happened.

882
01:00:15,425 --> 01:00:17,518
He's liable to get jumpy
hearing those shots.

883
01:00:17,594 --> 01:00:20,222
And check on this man's story.

884
01:00:20,297 --> 01:00:22,026
Yes, sir.

885
01:00:22,098 --> 01:00:24,498
All right, Arab, get moving.

886
01:00:59,469 --> 01:01:00,902
Captain Lance!

887
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:06,133
Captain Lance!

888
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:08,542
Joe.

889
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:14,975
It's him that took
those shots at you, Captain.

890
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:17,178
I guess he got scared
when he seen Joe there,

891
01:01:17,253 --> 01:01:18,618
and I can't find Rutledge.

892
01:01:18,688 --> 01:01:21,179
Worry about that later.

893
01:01:21,257 --> 01:01:24,317
Come on, on your feet.
On your feet!

894
01:01:36,006 --> 01:01:38,804
Dick, can you hear me?

895
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:41,639
Yeah, I can hear you, Joe.

896
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:45,670
You should have let me shot him
when we had a chance.

897
01:01:45,749 --> 01:01:47,546
Now it's too late.

898
01:01:47,617 --> 01:01:50,279
He's coming, Dick.

899
01:01:50,353 --> 01:01:52,685
Yeah, I know, Joe.

900
01:01:52,756 --> 01:01:53,848
You better let me help you.

901
01:01:53,923 --> 01:01:54,981
Listen.

902
01:01:55,058 --> 01:01:59,722
You remember that something
I couldn't catch hold of?

903
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:03,726
I finally got a hold of it.

904
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,395
Tucsos knows everything.

905
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,938
He's in no hurry, Dick.

906
01:02:11,374 --> 01:02:13,137
It makes no difference

907
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:16,940
if the relief column does come.

908
01:02:17,013 --> 01:02:18,742
Yes, Joe?

909
01:02:18,815 --> 01:02:22,808
Because he knows
the whole relief column

910
01:02:22,886 --> 01:02:28,654
was made up of only 31 men.

911
01:02:29,959 --> 01:02:35,556
Just 31... men.

912
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:57,843
All right, Kebussyan.

913
01:03:10,767 --> 01:03:12,200
For the moment,
I think we can assume

914
01:03:12,268 --> 01:03:16,068
that by this time tomorrow
some of us will be dead.

915
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:19,939
I never permitted men to risk death
in a combat detail under my command

916
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:22,307
without explaining why.

917
01:03:22,378 --> 01:03:25,677
Also, I'd like to straighten out

918
01:03:25,748 --> 01:03:30,447
any misapprehensions you may have
as to why you were picked for this detail.

919
01:03:32,055 --> 01:03:35,218
In each case, my only consideration

920
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:37,691
was the defense of Fort Winston.

921
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,524
The fort is under-manned,

922
01:03:40,597 --> 01:03:44,590
and I picked the men that I thought
could best be spared.

923
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:51,707
I'm prepared to give you
my individual reasons

924
01:03:51,774 --> 01:03:54,174
if you want them.

925
01:03:54,244 --> 01:03:58,374
If not, the detail is dismissed.

926
01:04:08,324 --> 01:04:09,882
Very well.

927
01:04:12,262 --> 01:04:14,355
Sergeant Murdock.

928
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,295
As for you...

929
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:20,462
your record as a noncom is full of nothing
but bullying and brutality.

930
01:04:20,537 --> 01:04:24,303
That's why you haven't been
offered your commission.

931
01:04:24,374 --> 01:04:26,638
The result is you're a malcontent.

932
01:04:26,709 --> 01:04:30,839
Your absence from Fort Winston is no loss.

933
01:04:30,914 --> 01:04:32,176
Yes, sir.

934
01:04:33,716 --> 01:04:35,650
Trooper Onstot,

935
01:04:35,718 --> 01:04:39,245
a man who will desert once
is a man who will desert again,

936
01:04:39,322 --> 01:04:41,620
given the slightest opportunity.

937
01:04:41,691 --> 01:04:44,159
Here there won't be any opportunity.

938
01:04:44,227 --> 01:04:47,025
The desert would be
a much worse enemy for you

939
01:04:47,096 --> 01:04:49,860
than any Apache
you might have to face.

940
01:04:53,002 --> 01:04:55,232
Trooper Rutledge,

941
01:04:55,305 --> 01:04:58,001
you came 2,000 miles
to serve under my command

942
01:04:58,074 --> 01:05:01,635
with only one motive: Revenge.

943
01:05:01,711 --> 01:05:03,611
With your intelligence
and your training,

944
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,148
you should have been
promoted many times.

945
01:05:06,216 --> 01:05:09,947
But your record shows
nothing, good or bad.

946
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:13,785
At Winston, they need men
who are more than adequate.

947
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:15,153
Yes, sir.

948
01:05:19,095 --> 01:05:21,757
Trooper Kebussyan,

949
01:05:21,831 --> 01:05:24,095
the reason for your
presence on this detail

950
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:27,261
won't be found on any record book.

951
01:05:27,337 --> 01:05:32,070
It's impossible to transcribe the feelings
that a man carries in his soul.

952
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:35,201
Here the dark thoughts that you carry

953
01:05:35,278 --> 01:05:38,042
will be less harmful.

954
01:05:38,114 --> 01:05:41,914
I don't think any other
explanation is necessary.

955
01:05:41,985 --> 01:05:43,213
No, sir.

956
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:48,716
Trumpeter Saxton,

957
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:51,919
you have long and publicly
made known your wish

958
01:05:51,995 --> 01:05:55,021
to trade your trumpet for a carbine.

959
01:05:55,098 --> 01:05:58,192
Last night I gave you one.

960
01:05:58,268 --> 01:06:00,828
However, both you and I know
that you're a coward

961
01:06:00,903 --> 01:06:03,303
and have no such wish.

962
01:06:04,774 --> 01:06:05,934
No, sir.

963
01:06:09,045 --> 01:06:11,741
Corporal Gilchrist,

964
01:06:11,814 --> 01:06:15,045
yours is a record
of drunkenness, brawls,

965
01:06:15,118 --> 01:06:17,052
and destruction of Army property

966
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:20,783
that is unequaled
in the United States Cavalry.

967
01:06:20,857 --> 01:06:23,883
Somehow you've managed
to keep your stripes.

968
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,394
But in the event of an attack on Winston,

969
01:06:26,462 --> 01:06:28,760
the proximity of the fort's whiskey

970
01:06:28,831 --> 01:06:32,733
would see you end up inevitably
in front of the firing squad.

971
01:06:34,237 --> 01:06:37,729
You've omitted me
in your analysis, Captain.

972
01:06:37,807 --> 01:06:40,435
Your rank entitles you
to privacy, Lieutenant.

973
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:44,469
I wish to know why
I was included in the detail.

974
01:06:44,547 --> 01:06:46,481
Very well.

975
01:06:46,549 --> 01:06:50,144
You're here, Lieutenant,
because you're an extremely ill man.

976
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:51,880
I needed an officer.

977
01:06:51,954 --> 01:06:53,979
There was nothing to lose
by selecting an off...

978
01:06:57,026 --> 01:06:58,687
You see what I mean.

979
01:07:02,498 --> 01:07:04,056
Any questions?

980
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:07,263
Yes, sir.

981
01:07:07,337 --> 01:07:09,032
What is it?

982
01:07:09,105 --> 01:07:12,302
I'm sure we all appreciate having
our little faults and weaknesses

983
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:14,502
pointed out to us, sir.

984
01:07:14,577 --> 01:07:18,206
But I imagine the captain
has a reason for being here, too.

985
01:07:18,281 --> 01:07:19,373
You think so?

986
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:22,850
Yes, sir, I think so.
We all think so.

987
01:07:22,919 --> 01:07:24,716
And just to even things up a little bit,

988
01:07:24,787 --> 01:07:27,085
I'd like to have the pleasure
of telling the captain

989
01:07:27,156 --> 01:07:29,989
what I think that reason is.

990
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:31,458
Go ahead.

991
01:07:33,396 --> 01:07:37,162
You were supposed to take
Tucsos up to Fort Grant,

992
01:07:37,233 --> 01:07:39,292
but you had the orders changed.

993
01:07:39,369 --> 01:07:41,530
Lieutenant Holloway went out

994
01:07:41,604 --> 01:07:45,472
and got himself conveniently
killed in your place.

995
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:48,908
Then you began to feel guilty about it,

996
01:07:48,978 --> 01:07:52,675
so you figured out a suicide mission
and fixed it so you could take

997
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:55,445
every one of us that you hated
along with you.

998
01:07:55,518 --> 01:07:58,316
That's all, Captain.

999
01:07:58,388 --> 01:07:59,946
That's the way it is.

1000
01:08:02,792 --> 01:08:05,761
So that's the way it is.

1001
01:08:05,828 --> 01:08:07,659
Yes, sir.

1002
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:10,130
Detail. Ten-hut!

1003
01:08:11,768 --> 01:08:13,167
Dismissed.

1004
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:17,999
Rutledge.

1005
01:08:18,074 --> 01:08:20,042
Yes, Captain.

1006
01:08:20,109 --> 01:08:23,010
You disappeared for a while last night.

1007
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:24,979
Where were you?

1008
01:08:25,047 --> 01:08:29,177
I went down to the corral
to take a look at the horses.

1009
01:08:29,252 --> 01:08:31,379
You're lying, aren't you?

1010
01:08:31,454 --> 01:08:33,888
That's an enlisted man's privilege, Captain.

1011
01:09:07,757 --> 01:09:09,315
Any sign from Onstot?

1012
01:09:09,392 --> 01:09:12,919
No, sir. He hasn't showed himself
for about 15 minutes.

1013
01:09:15,932 --> 01:09:18,423
You better go out there
and see if he's all right.

1014
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:19,490
Yes, sir.

1015
01:10:01,244 --> 01:10:04,680
You think you can handle a carbine now
without getting careless?

1016
01:10:06,415 --> 01:10:07,814
I think so, sir.

1017
01:10:10,453 --> 01:10:11,545
Here.

1018
01:10:12,889 --> 01:10:14,379
Thank you, sir.

1019
01:10:21,264 --> 01:10:22,629
Captain.

1020
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,496
Don't I get any?

1021
01:10:26,569 --> 01:10:28,833
No. Do you want to know why?

1022
01:10:31,173 --> 01:10:32,538
No.

1023
01:10:53,896 --> 01:10:57,024
Indians are on the other
side of the wall, Corporal.

1024
01:11:16,452 --> 01:11:18,283
Why didn't you shoot, you fool?

1025
01:11:18,354 --> 01:11:21,050
I thought better of it.

1026
01:11:21,123 --> 01:11:24,559
Shoot him, we'd all be done for.

1027
01:11:24,627 --> 01:11:27,960
He's the only man
can keep this outfit going.

1028
01:11:30,299 --> 01:11:32,460
Where are you, Onstot?

1029
01:11:32,535 --> 01:11:34,127
This is Murdock.

1030
01:11:51,354 --> 01:11:53,345
Five years I've been in the Army,

1031
01:11:53,422 --> 01:11:56,016
and I get captured
on account of a dirty Reb.

1032
01:12:03,265 --> 01:12:04,232
Captain.

1033
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,699
What is it?

1034
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:07,463
There's Murdock coming back.

1035
01:12:18,147 --> 01:12:20,479
Wait a minute, Captain.
That's Murdock.

1036
01:12:23,986 --> 01:12:28,548
No trooper ever carried
a carbine that way.

1037
01:12:28,624 --> 01:12:31,058
There'll be coming now.
Fire at will.

1038
01:12:52,782 --> 01:12:54,545
Hold your fire!

1039
01:12:55,885 --> 01:12:57,853
Let them carry back their wounded.

1040
01:13:47,403 --> 01:13:49,997
Winters, do you know
the trail to Arahawa Rim?

1041
01:13:50,072 --> 01:13:52,302
I do.

1042
01:13:52,374 --> 01:13:54,308
Yeah.

1043
01:13:54,376 --> 01:13:56,241
Yes, I know it. Why?

1044
01:13:56,312 --> 01:13:58,576
Well, as near as I can figure it,

1045
01:13:58,647 --> 01:14:02,048
the relief column ought to be
at the Rim sometime tomorrow.

1046
01:14:02,118 --> 01:14:03,745
I want you to ride out there

1047
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:07,255
and tell Captain Conrahan
to get here as fast as he can.

1048
01:14:08,891 --> 01:14:10,586
Do you really mean that?

1049
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:13,822
I just said it, didn't I?

1050
01:14:13,896 --> 01:14:16,387
You might be dead when I get back.

1051
01:14:16,465 --> 01:14:18,399
I'll take my chances on that.

1052
01:14:18,467 --> 01:14:21,459
How do you know I'd ride to Conrahan?

1053
01:14:21,537 --> 01:14:24,199
How do you know
I wouldn't ride for the fort?

1054
01:14:24,273 --> 01:14:27,333
It would solve all my troubles, you know.

1055
01:14:27,409 --> 01:14:29,741
Yeah, I know.

1056
01:14:29,812 --> 01:14:32,042
And I also know that
whatever your faults are,

1057
01:14:32,114 --> 01:14:34,207
you're still an Army man.

1058
01:14:36,051 --> 01:14:37,643
You can take my horse if you want to.

1059
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,382
No, thanks.
I got a good one.

1060
01:14:40,456 --> 01:14:41,787
Good luck, Dick.

1061
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:43,484
Good luck to you, Jerry.

1062
01:14:44,827 --> 01:14:48,160
How big a column does Conrahan got?

1063
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:49,424
400 men.

1064
01:14:49,498 --> 01:14:51,056
Nice round number.

1065
01:15:25,234 --> 01:15:26,701
Cease firing!

1066
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:44,510
All ready, Captain.

1067
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:49,523
Kebussyan, open the gate.

1068
01:15:56,932 --> 01:15:59,196
You all right, Saxton?

1069
01:16:00,903 --> 01:16:03,895
Yes, sir. Fine, sir.

1070
01:16:38,874 --> 01:16:40,842
I'd like to try to get through, sir.

1071
01:17:06,735 --> 01:17:12,605
Arab, what do you think about
when you're thirsty?

1072
01:17:12,675 --> 01:17:14,040
Water.

1073
01:17:16,478 --> 01:17:17,911
Water.

1074
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,538
Sometimes melons.

1075
01:17:19,615 --> 01:17:23,574
You're a great help, a great help.

1076
01:17:23,652 --> 01:17:25,620
Gilchrist!

1077
01:17:25,688 --> 01:17:27,019
Yes, sir?

1078
01:17:29,992 --> 01:17:32,119
Sometimes blood.

1079
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:41,128
You got a cigar, Corporal?

1080
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:42,192
Sir?

1081
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,671
I said, have you got a cigar?

1082
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:46,401
Yes, sir, in my saddlebag.

1083
01:17:46,475 --> 01:17:47,464
Go get it.

1084
01:17:47,543 --> 01:17:50,307
And take the pennant
off the guide-on and put this on it.

1085
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:52,779
Well, sir...

1086
01:17:52,848 --> 01:17:54,281
you're going to surrender?

1087
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:56,341
No, Corporal.

1088
01:17:56,418 --> 01:17:58,978
We're going to have
a little talk with Tucsos.

1089
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:01,113
But what's the cigar got to do with it?

1090
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:03,556
You just go and get it,
and you'll find out.

1091
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:06,253
And take that pistol off your belt.

1092
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:09,357
Yes, sir.

1093
01:18:38,394 --> 01:18:41,227
A charge of dynamite is under the rocks.

1094
01:18:41,296 --> 01:18:43,662
All you have to do is light
the fuse with your cigar

1095
01:18:43,732 --> 01:18:45,393
when I give the signal.

1096
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:46,491
Yes, sir.

1097
01:18:46,568 --> 01:18:48,536
If you have any trouble,
call my name out once,

1098
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:51,164
then get back to the fort immediately.

1099
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,673
Yes, sir.

1100
01:19:32,848 --> 01:19:34,679
Time short, hard one.

1101
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:37,275
Why you come out under pale flag?

1102
01:19:37,352 --> 01:19:40,719
I came to offer you
a chance to surrender.

1103
01:19:40,789 --> 01:19:43,952
You have strange courage, dog soldier.

1104
01:19:44,026 --> 01:19:47,757
Do you command mighty party
that you can speak such words?

1105
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:51,596
Or is it because you think
no army but your army,

1106
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:53,532
no warriors but yours?

1107
01:19:53,602 --> 01:19:55,695
By waiting half day,

1108
01:19:55,771 --> 01:19:58,638
I capture your men
with bag of water.

1109
01:20:12,654 --> 01:20:15,646
Your warriors have
great thirst, hard one.

1110
01:20:15,724 --> 01:20:17,783
My terms are simple.

1111
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:20,920
Your men will lay down their arms
and come through the pass on foot.

1112
01:20:20,996 --> 01:20:23,931
Scout I send back to you,

1113
01:20:23,999 --> 01:20:26,365
he able to speak before he die?

1114
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:29,737
He spoke.

1115
01:20:29,805 --> 01:20:32,171
Still, you make terms to Tucsos?

1116
01:20:32,241 --> 01:20:34,471
You heard.

1117
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:36,807
Help you have sent for will do no good.

1118
01:20:36,879 --> 01:20:38,471
1 and 30 men.

1119
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:41,311
Our chieftains have promised 400 men.

1120
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:44,648
It is not their way
to promise much and send little.

1121
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:47,712
I know what I say is true.

1122
01:20:47,789 --> 01:20:49,654
You're a liar.

1123
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:50,749
There is no more to hear.

1124
01:20:50,826 --> 01:20:51,918
Wait.

1125
01:20:53,629 --> 01:20:56,860
I do not speak foolishly or surrender.

1126
01:20:56,932 --> 01:20:59,366
I have brought with me strong medicine,

1127
01:20:59,434 --> 01:21:02,335
medicine that will make
these mountains tremble

1128
01:21:02,404 --> 01:21:04,872
and leap from the earth.

1129
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:09,343
I can destroy this pass
and all of your warriors with it.

1130
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:13,142
Watch. You will see.

1131
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:15,842
All right, Corporal!

1132
01:21:22,524 --> 01:21:23,821
Captain Lance!

1133
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:29,995
Very well, Corporal,
go back to the fort.

1134
01:21:30,065 --> 01:21:31,760
This medicine is controlled from the fort.

1135
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:32,857
Soon you will see.

1136
01:21:32,935 --> 01:21:34,698
You lie, hard one.

1137
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,237
Your medicine fail.

1138
01:21:36,305 --> 01:21:38,705
You who know all things know nothing.

1139
01:21:38,774 --> 01:21:42,437
Tucsos is growing old and foolish.

1140
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:44,877
No more time for talk, dog soldier.

1141
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:47,381
Return to fort, soldier.

1142
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:48,848
With no water,

1143
01:21:48,917 --> 01:21:52,409
you will soon be as dust
under hooves of our horses.

1144
01:22:19,214 --> 01:22:21,341
- What happened?
- I don't know, Captain.

1145
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:24,647
The fuse was gone
and that little cap thing, too.

1146
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,847
Somebody tampered with it.

1147
01:22:26,922 --> 01:22:28,446
That's what I'd say.

1148
01:22:47,776 --> 01:22:52,179
Looks like the fuse was gone
out of that demonstration charge.

1149
01:22:52,247 --> 01:22:53,805
That's funny.

1150
01:22:53,882 --> 01:22:56,476
I could have sworn I put it in.

1151
01:22:56,551 --> 01:22:59,714
Makes me wonder about
the charge up in the pass.

1152
01:22:59,788 --> 01:23:03,280
Maybe the fuse is gone
out of that one, too.

1153
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:06,759
Well, Captain, why don't you
take a run up there and see?

1154
01:23:08,864 --> 01:23:11,196
Why did you do it, Rutledge?

1155
01:23:11,266 --> 01:23:13,029
We're all of us caught up here together.

1156
01:23:13,101 --> 01:23:15,899
Where did you expect to go?

1157
01:23:15,971 --> 01:23:17,734
With you, Captain.

1158
01:23:17,806 --> 01:23:19,535
And just remember this.

1159
01:23:19,608 --> 01:23:21,098
I'm not committing suicide.

1160
01:23:21,176 --> 01:23:23,474
I'm killing you.

1161
01:23:23,545 --> 01:23:26,241
No, Rutledge, you are committing suicide,

1162
01:23:26,315 --> 01:23:30,581
because I'm going back up in that pass
with a new fuse the first chance I get

1163
01:23:30,652 --> 01:23:32,813
and blow it sky-high.

1164
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:34,287
And whatever you think,

1165
01:23:34,356 --> 01:23:37,621
I didn't bring this patrol up here
to get every man killed.

1166
01:23:37,693 --> 01:23:42,255
I'm going to get out
every one alive that I can...

1167
01:23:42,331 --> 01:23:44,765
and especially you, Rutledge.

1168
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:48,530
I'm going to get you back to Winston
and have you court-martialed.

1169
01:23:48,603 --> 01:23:51,629
I'm going to have you hung
with the strongest length of rope

1170
01:23:51,707 --> 01:23:54,403
in the whole New Mexico Territory.

1171
01:25:57,799 --> 01:25:58,891
Allah!

1172
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:13,913
Leave it alone.

1173
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:16,642
Leave it alone.

1174
01:26:44,579 --> 01:26:46,479
I'll need some bandages
from my quarters.

1175
01:26:46,548 --> 01:26:47,708
Yes, sir.

1176
01:27:08,169 --> 01:27:09,659
This what you wanted, Captain?

1177
01:27:09,738 --> 01:27:11,467
It was in Rutledge's pocket.

1178
01:27:12,908 --> 01:27:15,240
Yes, exactly what I wanted.

1179
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:19,041
If I can reset these fuses,
this mission may still be a success.

1180
01:27:20,382 --> 01:27:22,441
Judging from the ruckus
I hear out there,

1181
01:27:22,517 --> 01:27:24,712
our red brothers are
too busy at the moment

1182
01:27:24,786 --> 01:27:26,754
to pay much attention to us.

1183
01:27:28,557 --> 01:27:30,548
I'll need somebody to cover me.

1184
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,422
I'll go, Captain.

1185
01:27:33,495 --> 01:27:35,087
I am ready, effendi.

1186
01:27:35,163 --> 01:27:36,926
No, you can't go
with that shoulder, Kebussyan.

1187
01:27:36,998 --> 01:27:39,262
I will not let anyone else go.

1188
01:27:41,369 --> 01:27:43,769
All right. Come on.

1189
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:55,773
Before they kill me, I'd like to get
my hands loose for just five minutes.

1190
01:28:55,844 --> 01:28:57,869
Yeah, it looks like you're gonna
get your wish, Reb.

1191
01:29:26,641 --> 01:29:29,132
You always had me tired
with your dirty Yankee stripes!

1192
01:29:31,746 --> 01:29:34,044
Why you fight so soon before you die?

1193
01:29:34,115 --> 01:29:36,447
Because he's a no good
son of a Yankee mule.

1194
01:29:36,518 --> 01:29:38,110
Your hate is strong, dog soldier.

1195
01:29:38,186 --> 01:29:40,051
Yeah? Turn me loose
and I'll show you

1196
01:29:40,121 --> 01:29:41,884
how a dirty Yankee soldier oughta die.

1197
01:29:47,295 --> 01:29:49,286
I've waited a long time for this, Sergeant.

1198
01:29:49,364 --> 01:29:51,229
Just don't run away, Rebel.

1199
01:31:45,513 --> 01:31:47,242
Kebussyan!

1200
01:31:47,315 --> 01:31:49,545
Hurry! Hurry, effendi!

1201
01:32:00,295 --> 01:32:02,855
Go. Go, effendi.

1202
01:32:45,206 --> 01:32:47,231
Saxton, anything moving?

1203
01:32:47,308 --> 01:32:49,208
No, nothing.

1204
01:32:49,277 --> 01:32:51,643
Everything's quiet, Captain.

1205
01:33:03,925 --> 01:33:08,487
Well, Corporal, looks like
they cut us down a bit.

1206
01:33:09,664 --> 01:33:12,599
Yeah, I kind of figured they would.

1207
01:33:12,667 --> 01:33:17,400
Next time they come, they're gonna
cut down the rest of us.

1208
01:33:17,472 --> 01:33:19,463
Looks that way, don't it?

1209
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:26,947
You tried to shoot me, didn't you?

1210
01:33:28,816 --> 01:33:30,306
Sir?

1211
01:33:30,385 --> 01:33:33,149
Aimed your carbine
at me the other night.

1212
01:33:35,089 --> 01:33:37,614
Well, I...

1213
01:33:37,692 --> 01:33:39,489
I guess I got nothing to lose now

1214
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:42,427
if I admit that that idea might have

1215
01:33:42,497 --> 01:33:44,727
flitted through my head a little.

1216
01:33:44,799 --> 01:33:47,267
Why didn't you do it?

1217
01:33:47,335 --> 01:33:49,530
I can't rightly answer that, Captain.

1218
01:33:49,604 --> 01:33:51,765
Unless...

1219
01:33:51,839 --> 01:33:53,807
Unless maybe I got the sudden notion

1220
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:57,038
that it might kind of spoil things for you,

1221
01:33:57,111 --> 01:34:00,012
not going down in the line of duty,

1222
01:34:00,081 --> 01:34:03,482
which you're so fond of, so to speak.

1223
01:34:03,551 --> 01:34:06,179
No.

1224
01:34:06,254 --> 01:34:08,620
You're a soldier, Gilchrist.

1225
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:10,180
A professional one.

1226
01:34:10,258 --> 01:34:13,750
You may be creation's
worst mule son of a soldier,

1227
01:34:13,828 --> 01:34:15,887
but that's what you are.

1228
01:34:15,964 --> 01:34:19,422
That's why you couldn't do it.

1229
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,092
I knew that.

1230
01:34:21,169 --> 01:34:23,933
That's why I didn't have you shot
five minutes after I saw you point

1231
01:34:24,005 --> 01:34:26,940
the muzzle of that thing at me.

1232
01:34:27,008 --> 01:34:30,705
You could've had me shot
for what I did to them canteens.

1233
01:34:30,778 --> 01:34:33,770
Well...

1234
01:34:33,848 --> 01:34:35,509
In both cases,
I didn't have enough men

1235
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:37,380
for a firing squad anyway.

1236
01:34:37,452 --> 01:34:41,320
I knew that, Captain.

1237
01:34:41,389 --> 01:34:43,789
Meanwhile, I wonder if you'd
do something for me.

1238
01:34:43,858 --> 01:34:46,588
Anything you say, sir.

1239
01:34:46,661 --> 01:34:49,653
Down in my quarters,

1240
01:34:49,731 --> 01:34:53,895
you'll find my loose tobacco
and cigarette papers.

1241
01:34:53,968 --> 01:34:55,868
I'm not quite certain where I left them,

1242
01:34:55,937 --> 01:34:58,132
but they might have been under

1243
01:34:58,206 --> 01:35:01,642
one of those canteens,
you understand?

1244
01:35:01,709 --> 01:35:03,836
I need a smoke, Corporal.

1245
01:35:03,911 --> 01:35:07,472
It may take you a few minutes
to find the makings.

1246
01:35:07,548 --> 01:35:09,846
No longer.

1247
01:35:09,917 --> 01:35:11,475
Yes, sir.

1248
01:35:37,412 --> 01:35:38,811
Sorry you didn't get to find out

1249
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:43,681
how it was with me
sending Holloway off, Joe.

1250
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:47,119
Tis whiskey, not love

1251
01:35:47,188 --> 01:35:50,487
Brings you here at this hour

1252
01:35:50,558 --> 01:35:53,220
Oh, Barney, dear Barney

1253
01:35:53,294 --> 01:35:55,626
I can't let you in

1254
01:35:55,696 --> 01:35:58,028
From the look in your eye...

1255
01:36:02,336 --> 01:36:04,031
Sir, I forgot.

1256
01:36:04,105 --> 01:36:07,336
I couldn't find your papers
and your tobacco, sir.

1257
01:36:07,408 --> 01:36:08,807
I didn't think you would.

1258
01:36:08,876 --> 01:36:10,138
But I looked, sir. I did...

1259
01:36:10,211 --> 01:36:12,406
Captain Lance,
they're coming again, sir!

1260
01:36:25,893 --> 01:36:27,451
What are they doing out there, sir?

1261
01:36:27,528 --> 01:36:29,428
Doesn't matter much what they're doing.

1262
01:36:29,497 --> 01:36:32,227
We only got about 40 cartridges
left between us.

1263
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:34,291
Come on, you beautiful creatures!

1264
01:36:34,368 --> 01:36:36,268
Come on, you red-chested devils!

1265
01:36:36,337 --> 01:36:37,497
I'm waitin' for ya!

1266
01:36:37,572 --> 01:36:39,005
They'll be coming, Corporal.

1267
01:36:39,073 --> 01:36:41,541
Nothing like hurrying 'em up a little bit, sir.

1268
01:36:56,991 --> 01:36:58,117
Corporal, come down here!

1269
01:36:58,192 --> 01:36:59,625
You come up here, Captain!

1270
01:36:59,694 --> 01:37:01,321
The grade up here is different!

1271
01:37:03,498 --> 01:37:06,194
I can see where they're going!

1272
01:37:06,267 --> 01:37:08,428
Hundreds of red devils all over us!

1273
01:37:10,171 --> 01:37:12,332
Barney, dear Barney

1274
01:37:12,406 --> 01:37:14,670
I can't let you in

1275
01:37:14,742 --> 01:37:18,644
From the look in your eye

1276
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:21,307
You're gunning for trouble

1277
01:37:21,382 --> 01:37:25,250
To your spoutings,
go back where...

1278
01:37:28,256 --> 01:37:32,352
There's more to be seen
than the floor of a tavern

1279
01:37:41,469 --> 01:37:43,869
Merely slipped, Captain.
That's... That's all.

1280
01:37:47,241 --> 01:37:49,072
Hey, Captain. Listen.

1281
01:37:49,143 --> 01:37:51,008
I got me an accompaniment.

1282
01:39:30,811 --> 01:39:32,745
Cease firing!

1283
01:39:41,522 --> 01:39:43,786
Sergeant Thompson, take over.

1284
01:41:01,869 --> 01:41:03,359
We're about ready to go, Lance.

1285
01:41:03,437 --> 01:41:04,734
Feel fit to ride?

1286
01:41:04,805 --> 01:41:06,170
Yeah, I'm all right.

1287
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:08,231
Just taking a look at
this new weapon of yours.

1288
01:41:08,309 --> 01:41:10,209
Really something, eh?

1289
01:41:10,277 --> 01:41:11,608
Call it a Gatling gun.

1290
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:14,443
350 rounds a minute.

1291
01:41:14,515 --> 01:41:16,642
They were talking about it
my last year at the Point.

1292
01:41:16,717 --> 01:41:18,309
Does the work of a regiment.

1293
01:41:18,386 --> 01:41:20,320
That's why they gave me only 31 men.

1294
01:41:20,388 --> 01:41:21,946
All I need.

1295
01:41:22,022 --> 01:41:23,922
That gun's going to revolutionize war.

1296
01:41:23,991 --> 01:41:25,390
Yeah, I believe it.

1297
01:41:25,459 --> 01:41:28,451
Are you sure you're all right?

1298
01:41:28,529 --> 01:41:29,655
Get me that orderly.

1299
01:41:29,730 --> 01:41:30,788
Parker!

1300
01:41:30,865 --> 01:41:33,060
Tis whiskey, not love

1301
01:41:33,134 --> 01:41:34,226
You want me, Captain?

1302
01:41:34,301 --> 01:41:35,791
We're leaving.

1303
01:41:35,870 --> 01:41:38,236
Where's my captain? Captain.

1304
01:41:38,305 --> 01:41:40,705
We got everything packed,
everything you got, Captain.

1305
01:41:40,775 --> 01:41:42,970
Except...
Except the canteens.

1306
01:41:43,043 --> 01:41:44,169
They were empty.

1307
01:41:44,245 --> 01:41:46,270
Yes, sir, so we didn't bring 'em.

1308
01:41:46,347 --> 01:41:47,746
- Did we?
- No.

1309
01:41:47,815 --> 01:41:49,612
Mount up!

1310
01:41:49,683 --> 01:41:50,980
Move out.

1311
01:41:51,051 --> 01:41:52,814
Yes, sir.

1312
01:41:53,888 --> 01:41:56,482
Tis whiskey, not love

1313
01:41:56,557 --> 01:41:59,617
Brings you here at this hour

1314
01:41:59,693 --> 01:42:00,751
Giddyap!

1315
01:42:05,699 --> 01:42:08,361
Barney, dear Barney

1316
01:42:08,436 --> 01:42:10,427
I can't let you in

1317
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,638
Conrahan, take over the detail.

1318
01:42:21,715 --> 01:42:23,979
Yes, sir.

1319
01:42:24,051 --> 01:42:27,248
Detail, forward ho!

1320
01:42:32,059 --> 01:42:33,959
Hello, Doc.

1321
01:42:34,028 --> 01:42:37,020
Didn't expect to see you back.

1322
01:42:37,097 --> 01:42:39,065
I did.

1323
01:42:39,133 --> 01:42:41,363
Well, be that as it may,
under the circumstances,

1324
01:42:41,435 --> 01:42:42,902
I prescribe a drink.

1325
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:44,164
No, thanks.
I haven't got time.

1326
01:42:44,238 --> 01:42:45,170
I'm sorry.

1327
01:42:45,239 --> 01:42:46,866
I've got a report to make.

1328
01:42:46,941 --> 01:42:49,068
- To whom?
- Colonel Drumm.

1329
01:42:49,143 --> 01:42:51,941
He isn't here.

1330
01:42:52,012 --> 01:42:54,344
I sent him back myself yesterday.

1331
01:42:54,415 --> 01:42:56,440
Ordered him, as a matter of fact.

1332
01:42:56,517 --> 01:42:59,714
Told him I wouldn't
be responsible if he didn't go.

1333
01:42:59,787 --> 01:43:01,778
He's had two bad spells.

1334
01:43:01,856 --> 01:43:04,051
A third time you have one
with a cerebral hemorrhage,

1335
01:43:04,124 --> 01:43:06,786
you don't have another.

1336
01:43:06,861 --> 01:43:10,160
You can make your report to the mirror.

1337
01:43:10,231 --> 01:43:12,495
You mean...

1338
01:43:12,566 --> 01:43:14,761
I'm acting in command of Winston?

1339
01:43:14,835 --> 01:43:19,101
Till they send out another colonel,
or some chowder-headed major.

1340
01:43:19,173 --> 01:43:22,336
But if you insist on making a report
to flesh and blood,

1341
01:43:22,409 --> 01:43:24,877
I'd suggest Cathy Eversham.

1342
01:43:24,945 --> 01:43:26,606
Cathy?

1343
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:28,477
She knows now that she was wrong.

1344
01:43:28,549 --> 01:43:30,540
She's sorry.

1345
01:43:30,618 --> 01:43:31,880
And she's in love with you, Dick.

1346
01:43:31,952 --> 01:43:33,977
Believe me, she is.

1347
01:43:41,295 --> 01:43:43,786
Now, take it easy.
You've had five hard...

1348
01:43:43,864 --> 01:43:45,525
That's doctor's orders!

1349
01:43:45,599 --> 01:43:47,191
They say that this world

1350
01:43:47,268 --> 01:43:51,068
Is more wide than a barrel

1351
01:43:51,138 --> 01:43:56,269
And crowded with women
delightful to see

1352
01:43:56,343 --> 01:44:00,803
But the facts of the matter,
alas, is that women

1353
01:44:00,881 --> 01:44:05,215
Are always most happy bedevilin' me

1354
01:44:08,589 --> 01:44:13,322
If I was a human instead of a soldier

1355
01:44:13,394 --> 01:44:17,728
I'd go to my captain
and speak to him true

1356
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:23,464
I'd say, "Me poor bucko,
you're heading for trouble"

1357
01:44:23,537 --> 01:44:27,871
"Captain, dear Captain,
it's trouble for you"

1358
01:44:27,942 --> 01:44:30,137
Well, if what he says is true,

1359
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:32,940
I'm gonna take him out
and have him shot.

1360
01:44:33,013 --> 01:44:34,503
He's safe.

1361
01:44:40,754 --> 01:44:46,192
It's not me own self
that I'm thinking of, Captain

1362
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:51,596
Captain, dear Captain,
I'm thinking of you

1363
01:44:54,635 --> 01:44:57,627
