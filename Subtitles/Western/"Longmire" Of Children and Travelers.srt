really roughed up in there.

get him out.

I'll go see Henry.
Thank you.

that reform school in Arizona.

go check it out.

00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,955
I'll take care of it.

with the tri-county jail,

but now that Henry's
in there...

just drive back?

between good girls and bad girls

00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,407
They, uh, send you two
to help look for polina?

359
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,079
Yeah.

360
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,577
Come on in.

361
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,163
[ Clears throat]

362
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,493
Cold one?

363
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,420
I'll take one.

364
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,795
Ooh.

365
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:39,053
So, uh, any leads on our little
runaway tramp?

366
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,599
Still searching.

367
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,104
She's a sexy little number,
isn't she?

368
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:46,810
Who?

369
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,311
Polina.

370
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,601
[Chuckles]

371
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,814
Oh, brother,
you have no idea.

372
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,773
[Laughs]

373
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:00,111
Hey, uh, I saw
a convenience store nearby.

374
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,577
Would you be a sweetheart
and grab us some more beers,

375
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,538
get yourself a little
something sweet, as well?

376
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,622
Anything else?

377
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,922
Not just yet.

378
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,590
[Laughs]

379
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,259
Ah.

380
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,711
Oh.

381
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,637
She knows how
to fill out a uniform.

382
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,306
Oh, yeah.

383
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,386
So, tell me about
this polina.

384
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,062
Oh, she'll get
your tall boy tingling.

385
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,395
But, uh,
when she starts coming on to you

386
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,818
with that sexy
little Russian accent of hers,

387
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,770
do yourself a favor.

388
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,903
Keep it in your pants.
[Laughs]

389
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,905
I don't mind
a little feistiness.

390
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,486
[Laughs]

391
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,823
Well, feisty's one thing,
brother, but this girl's nuts.

392
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,624
You know, some days,
she is bashing

393
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,202
some poor little girl's
head in.

394
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,378
Other days,
she's off somewhere,

395
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,001
drawing pictures
of unicorns.

396
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,457
[Chuckles]

397
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,426
And other days,

398
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,845
she's waiting for you
in your office,

399
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,718
wearing nothing at all.

400
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,890
Really? Nothing?

401
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,934
Nothing but a dirty,
little grin.

402
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,978
[Laughs] So, uh...

403
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,475
...is that when you grabbed her
by the throat

404
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,401
and choked the life
out of her?

405
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,104
[Gasps]

406
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,689
Whoa, whoa.
What the hell?

407
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,571
See, I'm not looking for polina,
norwood.

408
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,991
I already found her.

409
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,991
Her body was dumped
in my county.

410
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,118
I'm looking for a killer.

411
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,620
[Scoffs]

412
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,622
What the hell you
breathing down my neck for?

413
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,204
Your phone
was at the crime scene.

414
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,256
Oh, shit!

415
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,217
[Sighs]

416
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,216
All right, look.

417
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,053
Um, when I found polina
in my office,

418
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,978
we, uh,
came to a little agreement.

419
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:55,311
She'd let me hit it and quit it,
and after I finished,

420
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,895
I'd leave a few doors
unlocked for her.

421
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,607
But after she left, I realized
she'd stolen my cellphone,

422
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,488
so I started tracking her.

423
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,410
I had to get
that damn thing back

424
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,488
or else my dumb ass
would get fired!

425
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,448
So is that
when you killed her?

426
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,705
Man,
I-I couldn't even find her!

427
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,670
You all's
cellphone coverage sucks!

428
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,167
[Sighs]

429
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:20,548
So I-l decided to lay low here
for a while, you know,

430
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,719
see how things played out.

431
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,512
Look, I know
this looks bad,

432
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:33,064
but I swear I'm actually
a really good guy.

433
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:37,151
You mean other than when you
were exchanging sexual favors

434
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,648
with underage girls?

435
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,025
When you put it like that,

436
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,483
you make it sound like
<i>i</i> did something wrong.

437
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,786
You did.

438
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,339
Is that our guy?

439
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,669
Could be.

440
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,424
We're holding him
for statutory rape

441
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,926
and, uh,
suspicion of murder.

442
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,179
Hey, Walt.

443
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:12,512
That was Ruby.
She called the tri-county jail.

444
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,645
Set up an appointment
for you and Henry at 2:00.

445
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,146
Anything else?

446
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,273
Yeah. We brought in
another driver --

447
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,774
a gareth ashbery.

448
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:26,655
He's from, uh...Riverton.

449
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,278
Branch, if you want
some time off --

450
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,703
come on, Walt.

451
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,827
What else am I gonna do?

452
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,206
Sit around
and reread the classics?

453
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,252
Let's talk to that driver.

454
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,218
Walt:
You often pick up hitchhikers?

455
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,591
I strive to live
in a Christian manner.

456
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,889
"Be not forgetful
to entertain strangers..."

457
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,093
"For thereby some have
entertained angels unawares."

458
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,803
Yes.

459
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:59,518
But perhaps sometimes
one entertains devils, as well.

460
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,572
Is it a sin
to kill a wicked man?

461
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,658
Yes, it is.

462
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:12,079
But what if this wicked man

463
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,953
sneaks into
his daughter's bed at night

464
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,000
and teaches her
filthy tricks?

465
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,669
[Tires screech]

466
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,418
She was fine
when you left her there

467
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,124
on the side of the road?

468
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,834
Yes. She was laughing.

469
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,339
Why?

470
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,342
Probably because she had just
stolen my wallet.

471
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,173
Did that make you angry?

472
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,975
Did you turn around,
try to get that wallet back?

473
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,304
No.
I just wanted to get away.

474
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,607
Her fantasies
were twisted, evil.

475
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,392
Vic:
Maybe they weren't fantasies.

476
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,228
Maybe she was telling you the
truth about what her father did.

477
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:48,191
Well, then,
I will pray to Nicholas,

478
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,947
the patron Saint
of children and travelers,

479
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,864
for the lord to guard her spirit
from each of her foes.

480
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,874
Why did polina
really run away?

481
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,122
LAN NY: What?

482
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,203
I'll take the truth
this time.

483
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,663
She wasn't happy here.

484
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,873
According to polina,
her father raped her.

485
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,174
Is that why she ran off?

486
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,797
How did you really get
that scar on your arm?

487
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,298
Hey, hold on.

488
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,471
We weren't perfect parents,
but we're not perverts.

489
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:15,017
I told you, she -- she attacked
me when I tried to ground her.

490
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,219
You also told me you hadn't
seen her in over 11 months.

491
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,225
Records show you enrolled her
in a reform school

492
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,601
just six weeks ago.

493
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,736
These aren't
our signatures.

494
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,689
I mean,
someone forged our names.

495
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:31,446
I bet that other family
put our names down

496
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,697
in order
to get rid of her.

497
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,653
What other family?

498
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,000
Listen, polina didn't run away
11 months ago.

499
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,372
We re-homed her.

500
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,587
Re-homed her?

501
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,083
I mean, we couldn't control her,
you know?

502
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,964
We tried -- I don't know.

503
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,049
We tried contacting
the angels of kirov.

504
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,505
They didn't even exist
anymore.

505
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:56,138
Social services
wasn't any help, so...

506
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,513
What did you do?

507
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,561
Phoebe: I joined
an online support group.

508
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,104
They suggested a chat room

509
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,728
where we might find someone
to take polina.

510
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,485
Who did you find?

511
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,938
A woman named Priscilla Gunther
over in durant.

512
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,819
She said
she and her husband, art,

513
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,492
had raised a bunch
of troubled Russian kids already

514
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,444
and had room
to take in another one.

515
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,451
So we put polina in the car,
and we drove up to durant,

516
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,657
and we re-homed her
with the gunthers.

517
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,413
With people
you had just met online?

518
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,246
We were desperate. It seemed
like they could handle her.

519
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,173
I mean, there's no law against
re-homing a kid like polina.

520
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,381
Unless, of course, the gunthers
turn out to be sexual predators.

521
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,462
They were nothing
like that.

522
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,344
I mean, she said she had
a psychology degree.

523
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,767
He spoke Russian.
They were excited.

524
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,560
No red flags. I mean,
we wouldn't have left polina --

525
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,264
so where did this re-homing
take place?

526
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,028
Gunthers lived here.

527
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,027
When did they move?

528
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,074
A couple nights ago.

529
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,992
Just up and out
without saying boo.

530
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,321
The gunthers have a daughter
named polina?

531
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,207
That might have been
her name.

532
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,661
Teens, pink hair,
sort of a handful.

533
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,587
Vic: How so?

00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,812
He took Sofia
to use the bathroom.

712
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,391
Our oldest daughter
is on a school trip.

713
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,977
We are so excited.
[Laughs]

714
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,043
We got to get out of here.

[Speaks Russian]

716
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,296
They're gonna take you
back to the orphanage!

717
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,295
What the hell happened
to polina?! Tell me!

718
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:17,971
Get in!

719
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,566
Tell me!

720
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:30,813
Polina came back.

721
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,735
She said she was
taking Sofia with her,

722
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,062
and I was gonna let her.

723
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,271
I was.

724
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,736
[Voice breaking]
But my husband heard us, and --

725
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:42,037
oh, my God, he was drunk,
and he just kept choking her!

726
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,008
What's happening?

727
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:00,505
Walt: Pull over!
Pull over!

728
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,925

[Tires screeching]

730
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,325
Step out
with your hands raised!

731
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,296
Drop the weapon!
I will shoot!

732
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,622
Girl: Let us be!

733
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,175
[Speaks russian]
We're family.

734
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,924
If you come any closer,
I'll shoot.

735
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,425
I'm here to help you,
Sofia.

[Speaks Russian]

737
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,434
You can only trust family.

738
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,936
Then you should know
polina sent me for you.

739
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,518
You know polina?

740
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,067
I feel now I do.

741

[Speaks Russian]

742
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,711
Polina abandoned us.

743
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,164
We can't trust her.

744
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,248
Polina had
a lot of problems,

745
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,459
but you brought out
the good in her.

[Gun cocks]

749
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,221
She said she'd always
be there for me.

750
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,927
Where is she?

751
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:33,857
Polina wanted to protect you,
Sofia, more than anything.

752
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,276
She never once
forgot about you.

753
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,478
You're lying,
just like her!

754
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,064
She wanted me
to give this to you.

755
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,158
[Both laughing]

756
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,087
Shoot him, Sofia, now!

757
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,222
I've failed a lot of people,
Sofia.

758
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,390
I'm not gonna fail you.

759
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,486
Okay.

760
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,565
You're safe now.

761
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,030
Ugh! Aah!

Oh, you broke my arm!

Ah! Aah!

764
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,331
I only wish I could do more.

765
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,190
Where am I going to now?

766
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:03,776
Somewhere better,
I promise.

767
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,158
Whatever it takes.

768
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,612
You sound like polina.

Thanks.
