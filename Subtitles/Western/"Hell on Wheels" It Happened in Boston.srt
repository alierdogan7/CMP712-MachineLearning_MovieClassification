the hell out of here.

185

Let's not appear to be fearful.

I'll only be gone a few days.
He gonna be any trouble?

187
00:11:48,602 --> 00:11:49,902
Well, he won't bathe.

188
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:51,621
And while you were in Cheyenne,

189
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:55,992
he pulled that knife when
I asked him to sweep the church.

190
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:57,376
Boy, don't you know better

191
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:58,711

on a church lady?

192
00:11:58,745 --> 00:12:00,830
You're not going to hurt him,
are you?

193
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:02,999
He ain't mine to whup.

194
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,918
Get your gear, boy.
You're coming with me.

195
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:07,803
He might've fallen off
a Mormon wagon.

196
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:09,439
Maybe somebody at the fort
will want him.

197
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:12,141
Will he be safe
traveling that far?

198
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:13,509
Safe as me, I reckon.

199

with that knife again,

to the Indians.

201
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:20,683
He doesn't think
you really will.

202
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:23,736
He don't know me so well.
Come on.

203
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:29,692

your request

204
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:33,579

on your behalf.

when I got word of the cholera.

381
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:44,720

You hung a Mormon boy, I heard.

393
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:42,411
Pretty sure his father
killed my chief of police

394
00:23:42,446 --> 00:23:44,447
and blamed his son.

395
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:46,833

how they're telling it.

I guess maybe Durant's right.

419

Some men are architects,

420
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:15,621
and others, just builders.

421
00:25:15,672 --> 00:25:17,123
I don't mind it like that.

422
00:25:17,174 --> 00:25:19,592
The offer still stands
