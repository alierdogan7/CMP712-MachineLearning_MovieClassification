FIGURE OUT WHY
I EVER GAVE IT UP.

19
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:42,300
- TAKES THE EDGE OFF

DOC, LIBATION!

29
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,868
I WONDER IF HE THOUGHT
I SAID "LIVE PATIENT?"

( gasping )

31
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:16,000

WILL YOU KEEP
A GIRL COMPANY?

39
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:52,567
I WILL,

ELLSWORTH?

45
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,567
YES, MA'AM.

46
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:07,267
MY LEISURE TIME'S USUALLY
SPENT AT THE GEM.

47
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,367
WHAT FILLS THE REST
OF YOUR TIME?

48
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:12,801
WELL, MA'AM, I'VE GOT MYSELF
A WORKING GOLD CLAIM.

49
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:15,234
WELL, SIR,
IS THAT A DAMN FACT?

50
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:17,400
YES, MA'AM, A HELL OF
A WORKING GOLD CLAIM.

51
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,334
AND IF WE KNEW
EACH OTHER BETTER,

52
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:21,334
I WOULD THROW FUCKING
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

53
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:23,501
IF YOU DID,
I WOULD TRY TO CATCH IT.

54
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:27,234
A WORKING, FUCKING

55
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:30,534

MY FULL RANGE OF EXPRESSION.

57
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:36,267
DO YOU SHOOT CRAPS?

58
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:37,801
NO, I DON'T.

59
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:40,434
BUT I'M A LETHALLY
QUICK STUDY.

60
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,100
COME ON.

61
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:57,467
JOEY?

62
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,133
I'M SICK, BOSS.

63
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,634
I AIN'T RIGHT.

64
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,767
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.
WALK THIS WAY.

65
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,334
I WOULD NEVER'VE
MADE NEBRASKA.

66
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:06,334
I GOT FEVER.

67
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,334
MY BACK'S HURT
SOMETHING AWFUL.

68
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:10,701
ALL RIGHT, SON, LAY UP

70
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,300
HERE'S THAT
LIST YOU GIVE ME.

71
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,734
YOU HOLD IT FOR AWHILE.

72
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:19,033
FELLA WHO COULD READ
SAID ONE OF THE ITEMS
WAS FOR SMALLPOX.

73
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:21,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING SHOWING
THAT LIST AROUND?

74
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,033
WELL, WHEN I GOT
POORLY BY BUFFALO GAP

75
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:25,067
I WANTED TO SEE
IF I COULD FILL
THE LIST THERE.

76
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:27,000
THAT'S A BREACH
OF GODDAMNED TRUST!

77
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,434
HAVE I GOT SMALLPOX,
MR. TOLLIVER?

78
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:32,834
HOW DO I KNOW?
MAYBE YOU GOT YOURSELF
A DOSE.

79
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:35,300
NO, I-I WOULDN'T.
I'M VIRGIN.

80
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,968
THAT'S HOW COME
I JUMPED WHEN YOU TOLD
ABOUT NEBRASKA PUSSY.

81
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:39,901
ANYWAY, GO LAY UP.

82
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,434
 <i>JOEY DIDN'T</i>
 <i>MAKE NEBRASKA?</i>

83

84
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,033
I WONDER IF JOEY WAS
AFTER A REMEDY FOR ANDY?

85
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,000
MAYBE WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING.

86
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,734
AIN'T YOU CLEVER,
EDDIE?

87
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:01,634
WAS I BEING CLEVER?
I THOUGHT I WAS WORRYING
ABOUT THE PLAGUE.

88
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:05,534
WHY DON'T YOU CONCENTRATE
ON RUNNING IN THE BONES
ON JOANIE'S MARK?

89
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:07,467
A WELCOME DIVERSION.

97
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,501

107
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:58,300

SORRY-LOOKING CABIN
EVEN IN THIS SHITHOLE CAMP!

176
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:35,367
PASSERS-THROUGH HAS
A RIGHT TO MAKE INQUIRIES?

177
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:38,467
A LEAVE-TAKER HAS IT.

178
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,734
( inhaling )

179
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:48,434
I CARRIED THAT
FUCKING CHILD!

180
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:54,434
NO, NOT IN MY BELLY, BUT

181
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,234
NONE OF THAT
FUCKING BLOOD IN ME.

182
00:13:57,234 --> 00:13:59,000
FUCKING COCKSUCKER!

183
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:09,000
IT'S JANE CANARY CALLING
FOR DOC FUCKING COCHRAN!

184
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:13,367
YOU FUCKING
IN THERE?

185
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,968
I BELIEVE
I'LL FUCKING WAIT!

186
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,834
TRIXIE'S UPSTAIRS.

187
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,000
E.B.'S WAITING FOR YOU
IN THE KITCHEN.

188
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,334
QUIT DRINKING A FEW HOURS.
WE'RE HAVING A GET-TOGETHER.

189
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:34,801
WHOM DO YOU MEAN?

190
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:37,033
BUY SOME FUCKING FRUIT
OR THE LIKE, HUH?

191
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:44,100
I TOLD YOU SOMETHING
STRANGE WAS GOING ON.

192
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,968
ARE YOU PREPARED NOW
TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS?

193
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:50,501
IF THAT WIDOW WAS HIGH
I AM A MONKEY'S UNCLE.

194
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,834
HOW MUCH FRUIT?

195
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:58,234
HOW MANY'S A FUCKING
GET-TOGETHER?

196
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:01,067
NOW ONE THING I CAN
TELL YOU, JOHNNY...

197
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:05,367
RIGHT NOW AIN'T
A GOOD TIME TO ASK.

198
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,734
HI, AL.

199
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,434
YOU TOSS THE PLACE?

200
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:19,501
I KNOW WHAT'S
IN THIS ROOM.

201
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,534
HOW'S THE WIDOW?

202
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:23,901
YOU GIVING HER
THAT DOPE?

203
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:26,100
I GIVE IT
TO HER REGULAR.

204
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,033
AND SHE TAKES IT?

205
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:30,801
SHE GOES BEHIND
WHERE SHE DRESSES
TO SPARE THE CHILD SEEING.

206
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:33,634
WHEN SHE GOES BEHIND
WHERE SHE DRESSES TO SPARE
THE CHILD,

207
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:35,868
DO YOU SEE BILLOWS
OF DOPE SMOKE RISING?

208
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,701
SHE SAYS
SHE EATS IT.

209
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:41,067
- DOES SHE ACT HIGH TO YOU?
- I CAN'T BE SURE.

210
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,033
I NEVER SEEN
A RICH PERSON HIGH
BEFORE.

211
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:52,067
NEXT PIECE OF DOPE,
TRIXIE...

212
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:57,434
 <i>YOU GO BEHIND THE SCREEN</i>
 <i>WITH THE WIDOW.</i>

213
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,334
YOU WATCH HER
PUT IT IN HER MOUTH,

214
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,667
YOU WATCH HER SWALLOW.

215
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,601
AFTERWARDS, YOU LOOK
DOWN HER FUCKING YAP

216
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,200
AND YOU VERIFY
SHE'S GOT NOTHING

217
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,334
ABOVE OR BELOW
HER FUCKING TONGUE.

218
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,434
I'LL FIND
A GOOD REASON.

219
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,334
YOU BEING FUCKING
CLEVER WITH ME?

220
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:11,834
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT

221
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,300
AND NOT AROUSE
HER SUSPICION?

222
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,033
ONLY SUSPICION YOU
GOTTA WORRY ABOUT IS MINE

223
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:19,000
OF IF YOU'RE GIVING IT
TO HER AT ALL.

224
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,167
WHY WOULDN'T I?

225
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:25,901
I'D RATHER TRY TOUCHING
THE MOON THAN TAKE ON
A WHORE'S THINKING.

226
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:30,267
 <i>ONLY KNOW THIS, TRIXIE,</i>

227
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:31,934
THAT WIDOW BETTER
BE MUDDLEHEADED

228
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:33,801
NEXT TIME FARNUM
SEES HER OR YOU PAY.

229
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:36,300
- CAN I GO BACK?
- PLEASE.

230
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,033
TRIXIE AND ME CHATTED
ON THE SUBJECT

231
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:07,167
- OF THE WIDOW
TAKING DOPE.
- I SEE.

232
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:10,501
- TRIXIE'S GONNA
MAKE SURE SHE DOES.
- GOOD.

233
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:13,133
YOU FIND PRETEXT
TO DETERMINE TRIXIE
AIN'T LYING.

234
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,501
OH.

235
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,901
 <i>( woman gasping )</i>

236
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,434
DAMSEL IN DISTRESS.

237
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:31,767
WILL YOU WANT ME BACK
FOR THE GET-TOGETHER?

238
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,467
HOW THE FUCK COULD WE
DO IT WITHOUT YOU, E.B.?

239
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,334
TRUTH ISN'T
IN YOU.

240
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:38,267
MAKES TWO OF US.

241
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:46,367
DOLLY WAS WITH
THAT DRUMMER.

242
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:48,133
'FRAID HE GIVE
HER PLAGUE.

243
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,634

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,634
IT'S LOVELY.

251
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:19,667
VERY LOVELY.

252
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:22,434
I NEED YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME.

253
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,000
 <i>AND I KNOW YOU CAN.</i>

254
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,167
WHEN FARNUM'S HERE,
SO WE CAN BUY YOU
TIME TO GET WELL

255
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,133
YOU HAVE TO FAKE
BEING HIGH.

258
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200

261
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:49,601
YOU BETTER HAVE A PAYING
DWARF UNDERNEATH YOU!

262
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:52,234
AM I DYING?

263
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:57,300
TURN OFF THE FUCKING WATER
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU DID.

264
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,701
- I KNOW YOU
DIDN'T FUCK HIM.
- NO.

265
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:02,267
YOU SUCK HIS PRICK?

266
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,033
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO SHOW IT TO ME TILL
HE HAD A HARD ON.

267
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:07,434
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL
A MISTAKE OF YOUTH.

268
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:11,567
YOU MUG IT UP
WITH HIM?

269
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,434
- A LITTLE.
- FRENCH LOCK OR NORMAL?

270
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:16,100
NORMAL.

271
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:19,868
SO ANY HOOPLE-HEAD
WHO DRANK

272
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,467
FROM THE SAME GLASS
THIS GUY DID

273
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:24,067
WOULD HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT
TO SIT THERE WEEPING AS YOU,

274
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:26,667
EXCEPT I CAN'T KICK HIS ASS
AND SEND HIM OUT TO WORK.

275
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:30,434
MY MOM DIED OF IT
WHEN WE WAS COMING OUT.

276
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:32,801
 <i>AND THAT'S WHEN</i>
 <i>DADDY GAVE US UP.</i>

277
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:37,100
WELL, THAT SAD STORY
MAKES ME BELIEVE

278
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,667
MAYBE YOU WAS EXPOSED
AND AIN'T A CANDIDATE
FOR IT NO MORE.

279
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,901
STICK TO HAND JOBS
A DAY OR TWO IF YOU LIKE.

280
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:58,267
THESE SHEETS
NEED CLEANING.

281
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,367
I JUST PROVIDED
NEW LINENS.

282
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,901
AND NOW THEY GOT
SICK ON 'EM.

283
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,133
TAKE THOSE
TO THE CHINAMAN.

284
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,734
SHOW YOU WANT
A CLEAN EXCHANGE.

285
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:07,834
SAY, "FOR MR. FARNUM, WU.

286
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:10,100
SHEET FOR FARNUM."

287
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:25,901
- HELLO.
- HELLO, MR. STAR.

288
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:27,901
- MAY I HELP WITH
THOSE SHEETS?
- I GOT 'EM.

289
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:29,901
HOW IS MRS. GARRET?

290
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:32,801
- STILL NOT RECEIVING.
- YOU DO TELL HER I'VE ASKED
TO CALL?

291
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:34,901
ON COMMISSION
FOR MR. BULLOCK.

292
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,367
HOW'S BUSINESS
AT YOUR STORE?

293
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:39,501
BRISK.

294
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:40,868
OH.

295
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,133
JESUS CHRIST!

296
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:04,267
YOU JUST SHIT
YOURSELF!

297
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:08,334
I TAKE IT YOU'VE BEEN
OUT ON A HOOT.

298
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,300
I'VE BEEN DRUNK
AWHILE, CORRECT.

299
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,801
WHAT THE FUCK
IS THAT TO YOU?

300
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:15,634
QUESTION WAS WELL MEANT,
LIKE IF YOU WAS

301
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:18,934
A FARMER I WOULD ASK YOU
HOW THE FARMING WAS GOING.

302
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:22,067
I DID LOSE MY FUCKING
BEST FRIEND, YOU KNOW?

303
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:23,868
I KNOW.

304
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:27,601
ANYWAYS, I AIN'T HERE
TO TEACH YOU ANY MANNERS.

305
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:33,167
I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT THE CHILD.

306
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,467
SHE'S FINE.

307
00:21:36,534 --> 00:21:38,567
AND WHAT ELSE?

308
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:41,567
AND SHE'S STAYING
WITH THAT WIDOW,

309
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,834
AND THE WHORE FROM THE GEM
IS WITH HER, TOO.

310
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:47,534
WHAT THE FUCK IS A WHORE
DOING WITH HER?

311
00:21:47,534 --> 00:21:50,234
THE WIDOW HAS HEALTH
PROBLEMS OF HER OWN.

312
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:52,567
 <i>AND TRIXIE'S</i>
 <i>TAKING CARE OF HER.</i>

314
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:57,701
YOU HAVE HIGH STANDARDS
AS APPLIED TO OTHER PEOPLE.

315
00:21:57,701 --> 00:22:01,267
I AIN'T JUDGING ANYONE.
I WAS SEEKING INFORMATION!

316
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:04,067
WELL, ARE YOU
ADEQUATELY INFORMED?

317
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,801
YES, I AM,
YOU COCKSUCKER!

318
00:22:06,801 --> 00:22:09,267
'CAUSE I AM
IN THE MIDST
OF A SITUATION.

319
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:11,033

IS THAT TO YOU?

321
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:24,834
FELLA IN THE WOODS I SEE
TO SAY HELLO TO HAS IT.

322
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,901
UNLESS HE CAUGHT IT
FROM A TROUT.

323
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:30,467
I FIGURED SOME IN THE CAMP
COULD BE DOWN WITH IT, TOO.

324
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:32,434
WHAT WAS HE DOING
IN THE WOODS?

325
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,767
SOMEONE THREW HIM THERE.

326
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:35,767
ANYWAYS, HE'S BETTER NOW.

327
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:37,400
AND HOW DO
YOU FEEL?

328
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,534
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

329
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:42,167
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- WHY?

330
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,868
I TAKE IT THAT YOU'RE
FEELING WELL.

331
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:46,934
- AM I WRONG?
- NO, YOU'RE NOT
FUCKING WRONG!

332
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:48,968
THAT'S ALL I WANTED
TO FUCKING KNOW!

333
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,667
I WILL LAY YOU OUT
AS SOON AS LOOK AT YOU!

334
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:53,901
THIS IS MY POINT.

335
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:56,334
YOU BEEN CARING
FOR A SICK MAN

336
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,701
WHO DOESN'T SEEM
TO HAVE GOTTEN YOU SICK.

337
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:01,100
AREN'T YOU A WISE
FUCKING OWL?

338
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,901
BEING AS YOU HAVE
A GIFT FOR IT,

339
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:08,901
AND I'M GONNA HAVE
SICK PEOPLE UP TO MY HIPS,

340
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:12,667
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT
WANNA COME BACK TO CAMP.

341
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,334
MY BEST FRIEND DIED.

342
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,400

NOW WILL YOU
HELP ME?

344
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:33,868
YOU CAN DO YOUR DRINKING
OFF WORK, LIKE I DO.

345
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:59,534
E.B.:
 <i>MADAM?</i>

346
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,701
YES?

347
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,868
 <i>HOW ARE YOU?</i>

348
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:15,267
BETTER, MR. FARNUM.
THANK YOU.

349
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:19,167
I'M GLAD.

350
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,634
HOW ARE YOU?

351
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:23,834
VERY WELL,
THANK YOU.

352
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:27,400
 <i>EXCUSE ME.</i>

353
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,601
- I BROUGHT MORE LINENS.
- HMM.

354
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,000
I'D HEARD
SOMEONE THREW UP.

355
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:46,934
( sighs )

356
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:55,534
WELL, APPEARS
LUCK PINCHES OUT

357
00:24:55,534 --> 00:24:57,801
AT THIS GAME EVEN
QUICKER THAN PROSPECTING.

358
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:59,501
IT CAN COME BACK
THAT QUICK, TOO.

359
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:02,868
NEVER WEAKEN,
SAME AS AT THE CREEK.

360
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:06,634
YOU WANT TO STOP FOR
A WHILE, ELLSWORTH?
WE <i>CAN</i> STOP.

361
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:08,367
 <i>OH, WHAT IF</i>
 <i>MY LUCK COMES BACK?</i>

362
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:10,701
 <i>WON'T BE HERE</i>

Joanie:
 <i>WELL, MAYBE IT'LL</i>
 <i>A WAIT FOR YA.</i>

364
00:25:12,934 --> 00:25:14,000
OF COURSE, TOO,

365
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,334
MAYBE IT WON'T,
RIGHT, JOANIE?

366
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:20,968
MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP
FOR AWHILE, HONEY.

367
00:25:20,968 --> 00:25:22,701
YOU NEED TO PISS?

368
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:24,834
EXCUSE ME.

369
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:27,334
DID I SAY THAT
TOO POLITE, CY?

370
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:29,634
GO HEAD OFF NOW.

371
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:33,934

373
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,300
PLACE YOUR BETS, GENTLEMEN.
PLACE YOUR BETS.

374
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,534
ALL RIGHT, LET'S WARM
THE WORLD BACK UP NOW.

375
00:25:42,534 --> 00:25:44,367
Eddie:
 <i>NEW SHOOTER COMING OUT.</i>

00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:48,701
SEVEN, THE WINNER.
THE WINNER IS SEVEN.

377
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:51,367
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET ON ME, YOUNG MAN?

378
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:54,234
WELL, I MIGHT
HAZARD A 20.

379
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:55,767
 <i>ALL RIGHT, NOW!</i>

380
00:25:57,868 --> 00:25:59,534

WAGONS,
WESTWARD BOUND!

385
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:13,567
- <i>IT'S A SEVEN.</i>
- <i>YOU BETTER GET</i>
 <i> ON ME NOW.</i>

386
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:16,934
I GOT A MEETING TO GO TO
AND I GOT A HOT HAND HERE!

387
00:26:16,934 --> 00:26:18,434
HAH!

388
00:26:18,434 --> 00:26:21,200
MONEY'S OUT FRONT,
HONEY.

389
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,801
OKAY.

390
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:28,267
SPOTS ARE COMING OUT
ALL OVER HIS BODY.

391
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:30,501
THAT DON'T DECIDE
HOW IT ENDS.

392
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,734
JOEY WAS CHERRY.

393
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:34,367
I KNOW.

394
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:36,734
HE DIDN'T WANT US
TO DO IT TILL HE KNEW HOW.

395
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:39,501
YOU'D DO BETTER
IF THE TRICKS

396
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:41,634
DIDN'T THINK LOOKING
AT 'EM MADE YOU CRY.

397
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,701
WHOA, NOW.

398
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:04,567
IT'S JOHNNY BURNS,
REVEREND.

399
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:12,701
MR. BURNS.

400
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:15,868
- HOW ARE YOU?
- THERE'S A MEETING
AT THE GEM.

401
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:18,033
MR. SWEARENGEN THOUGHT
YOU'D WANNA COME, TOO.

402
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:19,868
AT HIS SALOON?

403
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:21,234
YES, SIR.

404
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:25,200
MAY I ASK
THE MEETING'S PURPOSE?

405
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,734
WELL, HE DON'T GET
INTO THAT WITH ME.

406
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:29,667
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

407
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:32,167
TELL MR. SWEARENGEN
I WILL BE THERE.

408
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,567
HE'S HAVING ME
GET FRUIT.

409
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:37,000
I KNOW THAT MUCH.

410
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,968
FINE.

411
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:48,167
THE THREE RED HANDS
ON THE PONY'S FLANK

412
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:50,400
WAS THREE MEN KILLED
HAND TO HAND.

413
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,300
THE RED CIRCLE WAS
ONE KILLED ON HORSEBACK.

414
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,234
THE WHITE LINES
ON THE PONY'S LEGS

415
00:28:57,234 --> 00:28:59,367
WAS TIMES THAT HE'S
A'COUNTED COUP.

416
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:02,400
WITH THEM, WHETHER
YOU MEAN TO KILL YOUR MAN

417
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,234
AFTER OR YOU'RE JUST
SHOWING OFF,

418
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:07,801
YOU HIT 'EM WITH A GUN BUTT
OR A STICK OR A CLUB.

419
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:10,067
THAT'S COUNTING COUP.

420
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:12,033
THAT'S WHY HE COME
FOR YOU INSTEAD OF

421
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:14,367
PICKING YOU OFF WITH AN ARROW,
LIKE HE DID YOUR HORSE.

422
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:16,434
 <i>CHARLIE.</i>

423
00:29:16,434 --> 00:29:18,601
AH, THERE YOU ARE.

424
00:29:21,534 --> 00:29:25,167
THAT WAS ONE BAD <i>HOMBRE</i>
YOU GOT BY BULLOCK.

425
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,501
BILL'S DEAD,
CHARLIE.

426
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:34,167
OF YOUR OWN SEEING?

427
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:37,601
YEAH.

428
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:41,267
I HEARD IT SPOKE OF
TWO DAYS AGO,

429
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:45,200
 <i>BUT AS OFTEN</i>
 <i>AS HE WASN'T BEFORE,</i>

430
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,400
I HOPED HE WASN'T
THIS TIME, TOO.

431
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:51,400
I WAS AFTER
THE BASTARD WHO DID IT.

432
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,200
ANYTHING BROKE?

433
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,234
NO.

434
00:29:58,234 --> 00:30:00,934
CAN YOU RIDE?

435
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,400
YEAH.

436
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,501
LET'S GET
THAT COCKSUCKER.

437
00:30:08,901 --> 00:30:10,968
WE SHOULD
DIG A GRAVE.

438
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:14,334
I'D AS SOON NOT WASTE
THE FUCKING TIME.

439
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:17,467
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

440
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,267
YOU AIN'T DOING
HIM NO FAVOR.

441
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:26,000
I MEAN HIS WAY
TO HEAVEN'S ABOVE GROUND
AND LOOKING WEST!

442
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,734
WELL, LET'S
DO THAT, THEN.

443
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,767
DON'T YOU WANT TO TAKE
HIM OVER THE RIDGE?

444
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:37,467
THIS HOLE IN THE GROUND
AND PUT HIM UP THERE WITH
HIS HEADLESS BUDDY?

445
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:40,367
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT YOU
NEARLY GOT KILLED FOR.

446
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:42,868
INTERFERING WITH HIS
BIG FUCKING MEDICINE,

447
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:47,367
 <i>BURYING HIS FUCKING BUDDY</i>
 <i>OVER THE FUCKING RIDGE!</i>

448
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:08,167
TRIXIE DID HER WORK
AND THEN SOME, AL.

449
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,801
MUST'VE PUT A DOUBLE
HANDFUL OF THAT DOPE

450
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:11,968
DOWN THE WIDOW'S MOUTH.

451
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:14,734
DID YOU HAPPEN TO OFFER
ON HER GOLD CLAIM?

452
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:16,167
THE MOMENT WAS WRONG.

453
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,834
THE DOPE HAD MADE
THE WIDOW RANDY.

454
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,734
 <i>LUSTFUL LOOKS,</i>
 <i>HEAVY BREATHING.</i>

455
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:23,167
 <i>OUTTHRUST CHEST.</i>

456
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:25,100
THE FULL CATALOG.

457
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,667
ONLY HOPE YOU COMPORTED
YOURSELF AS A GENTLEMEN.

458
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:29,567
THERE WAS A CHILD
IN THE ROOM.

459
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:33,133
PEACHES AND PEARS
ON THE FUCKING BAR.

460
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:35,434
SPOON IT OUT AMONGST
YOURSELVES.

461
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:48,100
FIRST THING TO SAY IS...

462
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:52,534
PLAGUE'S IN
THE FUCKING CAMP.

463
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:54,901
SMALLPOX.

464
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:57,267
PLAGUE IS SPREAD
BY RATS.

465
00:31:57,267 --> 00:31:59,234
Al:
 <i>I WAS RAISED</i>
 <i>CALLING IT PLAGUE</i>

466
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:01,133
BUT DOC WANTS
THAT IN RESERVE

467
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:03,567
IN CASE OUR LUCK HOLDS
AND THE RATS DECIDE

468
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:05,334
TO DESCEND ON US,
TOO, HMM?

469
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:08,501
- ( laughing )
- BUT WHATEVER YOU
FUCKING CALL IT,

470
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:10,734
THE POINT IS FOR
NO ONE TO RAISE

471
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:13,100
THEIR FUCKING DRESSES
OVER THEIR HEADS.

472
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,067
YOU-- YOU WAIT
IT OUT.

473
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,033
YOU OUTLAST
THE COCKSUCKER.

474
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:20,501
I'VE OUTLASTED SEVERAL
FUCKING OUTBREAKS.

475
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:22,534
IS IT PRETTY?
NO, BUT IT PASSES.

476
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,567
SO, WE NEED A PLACE
FOR THEM TO GET IT.

477
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:29,801
 <i>TO CARE FOR 'EM</i>
 <i>AND TO KEEP 'EM OUTTA SIGHT</i>

478
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:31,601
SO PEOPLE DON'T GET
FRIGHTENED AND DISGUSTED.

479
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:33,334
MR. BULLOCK AND ME
HAVE LUMBER LEFT

480
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:35,267
FROM PUTTING
OUR BUILDING UP.

481
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:36,767
TENT'S A BETTER
IMPRESSION.

482
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:39,968
EMPHASIZES IT'S
A PASSING PHASE.

483
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:42,100
AS FAR AS A VACCINE,

484
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,300
ONE PLACE WE KNOW HAS IT
IS FORT CARNEY.

485
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,634
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT?

486
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:48,033
OFF THE FUCKING ISSUE,
TOM.

487
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,534
Doc:
 <i>BISMARCK</i>

488
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,501
AND CHEYENNE
PROBABLY GOT IT, TOO.

489
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:56,167
SO WE SHOULD SEND
TO ALL THREE PLACES.
AND AS TIME'S A FACTOR,

490
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:58,167
STAGECOACHES AIN'T
THE RIGHT CONVEYANCE,

491
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,801
SO I SUGGEST THREE GROUPS
OF HORSEMEN, HUH?

492
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:03,367
FIVE RIDERS TO A GROUP,
FEND OFF THE DIRT WORSHIPERS.

493
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:06,367
60 BUCKS A RIDER,
$10 IN ADVANCE, 50 ON RETURN.

494
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:09,501
E.B.:
 <i>WOULD BE THREE TIMES</i>
 <i>FIVE TIMES 60.</i>

495
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:11,200
$900 AT THE WORST.

496
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,400
ASSUMING THEY
ALL SURVIVE.

497
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,067
Al:
 <i>ADD IN, FOR THE VACCINE</i>
 <i>AND PAYING THE DOC,</i>

498
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:18,567
 <i>I WOULD SAY $1,500</i>
 <i>IS THE TARGET.</i>

499
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:21,300
I'M IN FOR FIVE.

500
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,734

KIDDING ME, E.B.?

502
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,567

00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:56,634
OH, OWE YOU A PENNY.

679
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,801
 <i>I'M BETTER.</i>

680
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:02,767
I WAS SO SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT MR. HICKOK.

681
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:04,634
YEAH.

682
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:10,501
YOU OUGHTTA GET
YOUR HUSBAND OUTTA
THAT CREEK.

683
00:44:10,501 --> 00:44:14,534
AS SOON AS I FEEL
JUST A LITTLE BETTER.

684
00:44:15,734 --> 00:44:20,534
ANYWAYS, I'M GLAD
TO SEE THIS LITTLE ONE

685
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:24,267
IN GOOD CONDITION
AND TALKING, TO BOOT.

686
00:44:24,267 --> 00:44:26,334
COME SEE HER
ALL THE TIME.

687
00:44:26,334 --> 00:44:29,567
NAH, I'M
FUCKING DRUNK.

688
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,901
I MIGHT BE SEEING
TO SICK PEOPLE.

689
00:44:35,901 --> 00:44:38,400
BUT I'M GONNA KEEP

690
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,467
THIS EXACT RECOLLECTION
OF YOUR LOVELY MUG.

691
00:44:42,467 --> 00:44:46,067
AND PUT A PENNY ASIDE
EVERY TIME I CURSE.

692
00:44:46,067 --> 00:44:48,868
 <i>AND THAT IS</i>
 <i>MY PROMISE TO YOU,</i>

693
00:44:48,868 --> 00:44:51,767
AND ME TOO.
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER
AGAIN DOWN THE ROAD.

694
00:45:06,767 --> 00:45:09,334
- GENTLEMEN--
- WELL, LET'S SEE IT.

695
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:12,167
OR SHOULD I SAY,
MY FELLOW AUTHORS?

696
00:45:13,734 --> 00:45:15,334
Jane:
 <i>I'M DONE IN THERE!</i>

697
00:45:15,334 --> 00:45:17,267
WHERE WOULD THE DOC
HAVE GOT TO?

698
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:19,234
SOUTH END
OF CHINAMAN'S ALLEY.

699
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,300
THEY'LL GET ME THERE.

700
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:34,100
I THINK MAYBE IT SHOULD
HAVE A QUESTION MARK.

701
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,601
"THE PLAGUE
IN DEADWOOD?"

702
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:37,968
THE TYPE IS SET.

703
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,834
YOU'RE READING
THE DEFINITIVE EDITION.

704
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:44,167
LET'S RUN IT.

705
00:45:47,467 --> 00:45:49,400
NICE WORKING WITH YOU.

706
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:06,334
- TAKE HIM
RIGHT OVER HERE.
- ( man coughs )

707
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,067
 <i>IT'S ALL RIGHT</i>
 <i>TO BREATHE,</i>

708
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:17,067
 <i>JUST TURN YOUR HEAD</i>
 <i>AWAY FROM HIM.</i>

709
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:19,734
( muffled )
OKAY, DOC.

710
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:21,400
ALL RIGHT.

711
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,133
ROLL HIM OVER
ON HIS SIDE.

712
00:46:25,267 --> 00:46:28,000
TURN HIM
BACK THIS WAY.
THAT'S IT.

713
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:32,534
ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU, FELLAS.

714
00:46:32,534 --> 00:46:34,334
BYE, DOC.

715
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,634
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SON.

716
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:41,167
IT'S GOING 
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

717
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,801
Jane:
 <i>HEY!</i>

718
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:49,167
HEY, SOMEBODY!

719
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,367
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE UP TO THIS?

720
00:46:57,868 --> 00:46:59,934
OH YES.

721
00:46:59,934 --> 00:47:02,200
I'M RIGHT WHERE
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE.

722
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,701
 <i>( man coughing )</i>

723
00:47:04,701 --> 00:47:07,200
 <i>( panting )</i>

724
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:18,067
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE
FOR YOU.

725
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:19,601
SO I SEE.

726
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:24,067
YOU ALREADY BEEN EXPOSED,
YOU WANNA FOLLOW HIM IN?

727
00:47:24,067 --> 00:47:26,000
I MIGHT.

728
00:48:55,067 --> 00:48:59,467
"'THE PIONEER' WAS ASSURED
OF THEIR IMMINENT RETURN."

729
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:03,467
I'LL BELIEVE IT
WHEN I SEE IT.

730
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,934
"IMMINENT RETURN" IS ONE
OF MY CONTRIBUTIONS

731
00:49:07,934 --> 00:49:10,701
TO THE FUCKING ARTICLE.
THE IDEA FOR THAT PHRASE.

732
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,167
"PEST TENT BEING
ERECTED AT THE SOUTH--"

733
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:19,567
WHAT ABOUT THAT
FUCKING TOLLIVER

734
00:49:19,567 --> 00:49:21,868
BUYING UP PROPERTY
ON THE Q.T., HUH?

735
00:49:21,868 --> 00:49:23,934
WE'RE LUCKY HE WAS
STRUGGLING WITH THE SHIT

736
00:49:23,934 --> 00:49:26,667
WHEN HE MADE THE OFFER
TO LOAN OUT THE LOT.

737
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:29,701
NONETHELESS, IT SAYS THE MAN
SEES THE POSSIBILITIES
OF THE THINGS.

738
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:31,601
I MEAN, TO COME UP
AT THIS FUCKING JUNCTURE

739
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,901
WITH THE IDEA
OF CREATING AN EMPORIUM
FOR THE FUCKING CHINKS

740
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:36,234
TAKES BRASS FUCKING BALLS,

741
00:49:36,234 --> 00:49:38,133
AND A LONG-TERM VISION
FOR THE FUTURE.

742
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:43,434
MERRICK.

743
00:49:43,434 --> 00:49:46,234
MERRICK WANTED
TO PUT HERE <i>"GRATIS."</i>

744
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:48,067
NOW IS THE IDEA

745
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:51,667
TO INFORM YOUR READER
OR MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE
A FUCKING DUNCE?

746
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:53,367
I HAD HIM PUT "FREE."

747
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:56,701
DON'T SEE WHY HE DOESN'T
HAVE NEWS OF THE BASEBALL.

748
00:49:56,701 --> 00:49:59,133
THAT NEW LEAGUE STARTED
A TEAM IN CHICAGO.

749
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:03,567
DIFFERENT PATH TAKEN

750
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,667
AT CERTAIN FORKS
IN THE ROAD,

751
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:08,100
WHO KNOWS WHAT KIND
OF A JOINT WE'D BE IN NOW?

752
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,567
OF COURSE, TRUTH IS,
AS A BASE OF OPERATIONS,

753
00:50:11,567 --> 00:50:14,968
YOU CANNOT BEAT
A FUCKING SALOON.

754
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,501
AH!

755
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,400
 <i>( blues music playing )</i>

756
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:33,300
