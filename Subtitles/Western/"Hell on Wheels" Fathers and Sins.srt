1
00:00:00,062 --> 00:00:03,170
Previously on AMC's Hell On Wheels...

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,817
You owe me a life

3
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:07,752
for the one you took from me today.

4
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:11,529
Every one and every thing
that travels by railroad

5
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:14,380
east, west, north, south,
will pass through here.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,941
And stay at my hotel.

7
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:17,897
You reach Cheyenne in 20 days

8
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,721
on time and on budget and I will convince

9
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:22,578
Congress to reinstate you permanently.

10
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:24,724
Aah!

11
00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:27,534
John...

12
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:38,033
Ezra, stop.
Listen.

13
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:41,420
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Don't run away like that.

14
00:00:41,454 --> 00:00:43,088
Ezra!

15
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:44,757
A knife doesn't scare me,
young man.

16
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,759
- Hold still.
- [Chuckles]

17
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:52,631
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
boy a good whuppin' won't fix.

18
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:54,183
Yeah.

19
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,556
Think we'll start
with a haircut first.

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,592
Mm-hmm.

21
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:00,942
Let's get to it.

22
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,445
Yeah.

23
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,064
A woman like that good
with scissors and a Bible?

24
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:07,866
You ought to marry her up,
Mr. Bohannon,

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,035
before Miss Ruth find her
some other lowlife

26
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,621
fancy belt-wearing huckster
that come along.

27
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,372
You callin' me a fancy lowlife

28
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,707
belt-wearing huckster, Psalms?

29
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:17,358
[Chuckles]

30
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:22,080
Uh, no sir, Mr. Bohannon.

31
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:23,715
All anybody needs to be
concerned with today

32
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:25,584
is making Cheyenne by tomorrow.

33
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:27,836
Yes, sir, Mr. Bohannon.

34
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,392
All right, y'all, listen up!

35
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:38,013
That there dot on the horizon
is Cheyenne!

36
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:41,099
I promised General Grant
hisself...

37
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,436
that we'd make it there
by tomorrow at sunset.

38
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:47,188
It gives us two days
to lay 5 mile of track.

39
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:49,741
Mr. Bohannon,
speaking for the Irish,

40
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:51,660
all due respect, sir,
but tomorrow's Sunday.

41
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,411
It's the lord's day,
not a work day.

42
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,946
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That's right.

43
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:58,366
Even the lord makes
exceptions, Mr. Quinn.

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,918
And sacrifices.

45
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:01,786
In fact, the only thing
he don't make

46
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:03,672
is the extra money
I'm gonna put in your pockets

47
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,173
you get us to Cheyenne
on schedule.

48
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:06,174
Yeah, that's true.

49
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,094
This right here...

50
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,379
is the rest of my stock.

51
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:12,881
I'm cashing it in.

52
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:14,466
Spreading it around.
Who wants a piece?

53
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:16,635
All: Yeah.
- I want a piece.

54
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:18,806
Well, I suppose it's no sin
to work on the lord's day.

55
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:20,438
Long as we don't
make a habit of it.

56
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,973
And my crew
will take a piece of that.

57
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,642
Work be our ticket to heaven.

58
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:25,393
We'll ride this train
and that stock

59
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:26,861
all the way to Cheyenne.

60
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,400
We've been through
hell and back.

61
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:35,203
Indians, rain, drought...

62
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:38,873
cholera.

63
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,660
You men have done
a hell of a job.

64
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:43,912
I'm proud of all of y'all.

65
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:51,252
Now...

66
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:53,505
you get us to Cheyenne
by tomorrow night,

67
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:55,090
first two rounds is on me!

68
00:02:55,124 --> 00:02:56,308
All: Yeah.

69
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,892
Whores are on Dutch.

70
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:58,893
All: Yeah!

71
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,895
Get to work!

72
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,013
[Indistinct chatter]

73
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,789
[Whistle blowing]

74
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:32,293
[Distant train whistle]

75
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:46,274
Good God, he's going to do it.

76
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:47,726
Who is?

77
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:48,860
Bohannon!

78
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:50,812
He's right there.

79
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:52,864
Tomorrow, he'll be right here,

80
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:55,650
laying tracks in my town.

81
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:57,402
Pennies on my eyes.

82
00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:59,821
Our town.

83
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:02,523
You keep leaving that
rather important part out.

84
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:09,414
Hmm. How did you sleep
last night, Mr. Durant?

85
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:12,801
Those goose down mattresses,
they cost a fortune.

86
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,836
[Spyglass snaps shut]

87
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:19,224
What?

88
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:21,593
You sell cattle to Bohannon.

89
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:24,312
You lend me money
to build <i>our</i> town.

90
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:26,815
You build a hotel
on the best lot in Cheyenne

91
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,318
and charge me
full fare to rent a room.

92
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:33,521
Now, if I didn't know better,

93
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:36,274
I might think you were playing
both ends against the middle,

94
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:37,492
Mrs. Palmer.

95
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,861
Hmm.

96
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:41,496
Thank you, Abigail.

97
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,915
[Clears throat]

98
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:46,601
Often, your interests
align with mine.

99
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:48,136
Occasionally, they don't.

100
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,540
[Laughs] Your interests
align with mine?

101
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:54,459
I think you got it backwards.

102
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,294
[Chuckling]

103
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:00,682
Mmm.

104
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:02,517
Quail?

105
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:05,520
Dove.

106
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:08,356
The French call it detente.

107
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,691
It's what you and Bohannon
better reach

108
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,309
before he reaches Cheyenne.

109
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,361
Make peace with Bohannon?

110
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:15,647
To what end?

111
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:17,198
You promised me
Cheyenne would be

112
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,567
the most important
railroad city in America.

113
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:21,001
How are you
going to accomplish that

114
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:25,039
without the cooperation
of the railroad?

115
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,042
You are an exasperating woman,
Mrs. Palmer.

116
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:32,630
Why? Because I talk like
a blunt-talkin' man?

117
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,467
Send Bohannon a telegram.

118
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,885
Invite him to lunch.

119
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,053
Today.

120
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,090
Work it out.

121
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:44,843
Nothing is that easy
with Bohannon.

122
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:47,428
I am not sure he's the problem.

123
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:04,412
That's him.

124
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:22,046
Lot of guns down there.

125
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:23,681
All the guns in the world

126
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,167
will not protect
Cullen Bohannon.

127
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:51,739
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>

128
00:07:16,993 --> 00:07:18,359
Ruth.

129
00:07:19,996 --> 00:07:21,663
Ruth.

130
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:23,882
Mr. Bohannon.

131
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,584
This just came for you.

132
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:31,951
She wrote this down right?

133
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:34,643
Yes, sir.

134
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:36,344
Thank you, Luke.

135
00:07:39,617 --> 00:07:41,099
Ruth.

136
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:50,942
Where's Ruth at?

137
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,476
Hey, she gave you a haircut.

138
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,006
Looks good.

139
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:10,158
Ruth?

140
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:16,458
I've kept you out of your bed
long enough, Mr. Bohannon.

141
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:18,510
I'll be on the noon train
to Omaha.

142
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:20,429
There's an orphanage
in Council Bluffs.

143
00:08:20,463 --> 00:08:22,547
- I can take Ezra--
- Ruth...

144
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:27,636
stop it.

145
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:40,899
I'm sorry, but if a tenant
of Christ's teachings

146
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,704
is selflessness, then I have
been a poor disciple.

147
00:08:45,738 --> 00:08:48,073
Sean McGinnis
was a troubled soul.

148
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:50,492
His brother relieved him
of his troubles.

149
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:52,661
Now, that weren't
through no fault of yours.

150
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:55,163
Sean came to me
to unburden himself.

151
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:57,382
He came seeking solace.

152
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,500
And...

153
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:03,872
and I denied him.

154
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:13,148
Perhaps I would do well

155
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:16,852
to spend some time
away from this place.

156
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,698
The men need you here, Ruth.

157
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:36,338
I have made no difference

158
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:37,873
in their lives.

159
00:09:39,742 --> 00:09:42,177
Well, you've given me comfort.

160
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:44,296
And you've given me hell too.

161
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:45,714
[Chuckles]

162
00:09:45,748 --> 00:09:48,350
In equal parts,
according to what I deserve.

163
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:50,886
And I ain't the only one.

164
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,858
Do you want me to stay,
Mr. Bohannon?

165
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:07,319
Hell on wheels just needs
a good preacher, Ruth.

166
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,954
And you are.

167
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:11,323
You are a good preacher.

168
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,244
Tomorrow's Sunday.

169
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:19,715
The men expect
to get preached to.

170
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:21,666
They expect you
to do the preaching.

171
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:23,418
That's all there is to it.

172
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:27,389
Come on, boy.
Get your hat.

173
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:29,091
We're going to Cheyenne.

174
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:37,516
You have a seat.

175
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:40,068
You stay right there too.

176
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:42,771
- Mickey.
- You're just in time.

177
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:46,158
Chief of police over there
is full as a gypsy's bra,

178
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:48,577
and I'm almost positive
that Wallace

179
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:50,378
is dealing
off the bottom of the deck.

180
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:54,616
Thank you.

181
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:58,286
Take two.

182
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:14,002
Take your damn scalp and get
the hell out of here.

183
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:20,392
- Oh, you can leave that.
- That's my money.

184
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:23,028
Not anymore, it ain't.

185
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:24,446
Um...

186
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:37,793
You best give me that.
It cost me $1.

187
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:41,129
Agh!

188
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:43,548
Thanks for the warning.

189
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,067
Ugh!

190
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:47,052
[Sniffles]

191
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:51,006
You know what that is?

192
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,558
That's a telegram.

193
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:55,310
From Durant.

194
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:58,647
Asking me to come to Cheyenne.

195
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:00,599
What for?

196
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,684
If I didn't know better,
I'd say he's surrendering.

197
00:12:02,718 --> 00:12:04,352
He knows we're gonna be
in Cheyenne tomorrow

198
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:05,487
and wants to broker a deal.

199
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:07,739
Know what that means?

200
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:09,491
Hey.
[Knocks on table]

201
00:12:11,828 --> 00:12:14,663
We won the damn war, damn it.

202
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:20,285
Ain't none of us out here
never won nothin'.

203
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:23,121
And never will.

204
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:26,625
Otherwise, we wouldn't
be here in the first place.

205
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:34,549
Quit your damn bitchin'.

206
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,051
You're comin' to Cheyenne.
Let's go.

207
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:38,386
Well, what you need me for?

208
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,523
Victory needs an audience,
and you is he.

209
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:42,724
Come on, my friend.

210
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:47,896
[Sighs]

211
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:58,707
[Coins clinking]

212
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:01,877
[Retches]

213
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:03,745
[Coughing]

214
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,590
Where my money at?

215
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:18,593
Put your hat on.
You might find it.

216
00:13:18,628 --> 00:13:21,096
Uh-uh.
Come on.

217
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:37,495
I was wondering
when you'd come.

218
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,863
Forgive me.

219
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:40,815
If you're praying,
I can come back.

220
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:45,153
How will you tell it?

221
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:49,157
"Cain and Abel"?

222
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,596
"Fallen woman pastor
brings murder into her church"?

223
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,718
Is that how you see yourself...

224
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:02,170
a fallen woman pastor?

225
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,649
This doesn't have to be
about the newspaper.

226
00:14:26,412 --> 00:14:31,833
Do you ever wonder how we came
to be in this forsaken place?

227
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:33,418
[Sighs]

228
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:36,304
Well...

229
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:39,257
if I believed in God,

230
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:43,178
which...I don't...

231
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:47,732
I would say it's for my sins.

232
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:50,986
I have just enough faith
to condemn me

233
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,989
for the sins I've committed
since I arrived here.

234
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:58,726
What sins?

235
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:06,001
I've been praying
for understanding.

236
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,420
I-it isn't...

237
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:11,706
a sin to pray
for understanding, is it?

238
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,125
Oh, we can't know God's will.

239
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,681
So...

240
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:21,383
where does that leave you?

241
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:24,352
Will you...go back east?

242
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,526
Mr. Bohannon has...

243
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,874
asked me to stay
with the railroad.

244
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:38,650
So...perhaps he's the answer
to your prayers.

245
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:41,119
[Chuckles]

246
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:42,871
[Both laugh]

247
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:45,240
A man with the mark of Cain.

248
00:15:45,274 --> 00:15:48,376
[Chuckles]

249
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:51,079
That would be ironic.

250
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:00,889
You have feelings for him.

251
00:16:00,923 --> 00:16:02,257
Don't you?

252
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:16,688
Why we going to Cheyenne?

253
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:22,277
- I already told you.
- No, you ain't.

254
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:24,829
- When you tell me?
- Would you just shut--

255
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:26,831
shut up.

256
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:28,783
You're makin' my head hurt.

257
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,990
Ho.

258
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:41,846
What we doing?

259
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:44,766
Men coming up behind us.
Don't look back.

260
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,720
Who they?

261
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:50,638
Told you not to look back.

262
00:16:50,672 --> 00:16:52,640
Who is it?

263
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:55,059
Damn it, Elam!

264
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:57,862
Come on.
Get up.

265
00:16:57,897 --> 00:16:59,614
Get back on.

266
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,321
Get to the border of Cheyenne,
fast and straight.

267
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:07,405

What in God's name is going on?

00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:54,758
I'd keep my head down
if I was you!

- I'm drunk.
- Christ!

Yep.

290
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:24,655
- Get that boy upstairs!
- You get him upstairs.

This is my hotel, and those
windows cost a fortune!

- In the back.

Not everything bad
that happens to you

317

- is my fault, Bohannon.
- Mostly it is.

318
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:49,573
I told you
there was a range war coming.

319
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:51,291
Not all my neighbors
are happy with my decision

320
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:53,076
to sell livestock
to the railroad.

321
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,411
Or build this town.

322
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:55,996
No, they come after me.

323
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:59,132
I don't think is a first
for you, Bohannon.

324
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,752
Whoever they is,
they got us outnumbered

325
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:03,587
and outgunned.

326
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:04,805

Not much.

330
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,477
Shit.

331
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:12,396
We got women and children
in here.

332
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,148
All they got to do
is wait us out.

333
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:17,267
This town got a telegraph
office, don't it?

334
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,770
Yes. Up the street.

only a few hours from here.

you'll be dead

the cavalry gets here.

00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:27,194
That is a distinct possibility.

339
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:33,619
You keep 'em off me till
I get across the street,

340
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:35,786
we might make it.

341
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,205
You got that boy upstairs.

342
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:39,206

00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:42,259
You want me to cover you?

you a better shot than me.

346
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:52,886

nobody'll be hurt.

You ain't believin' him.

00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:53,580
Ain't no sense
in all of us getting killed.

You're right.

"Best damn thing
that ever happened to me."

00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:14,748

00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,390
I don't...

389
00:24:40,424 --> 00:24:42,759
You finish that road.

390

And, Elam...

you was lying about that.

Wha--they took him.

to get at you.

Hey.

405
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:04,901
You might need this.

406
00:27:12,376 --> 00:27:14,677
I'm gonna take the back.

Soon as you drop your gun belt.

to do with this.

All right.

416
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,268
Let him go.

417
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:46,603
You drop your gun belt

418
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:48,404
and you come out
where I can see you.

Mr. Ferguson's
back along the way.

420
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:22,187
You go with him
back to the hotel.

You listen to Miss Ruth,
you hear me?

Go on.

425
00:30:02,858 --> 00:30:04,299
They say why they took him?

426
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:06,854
I think it's the Mormons
for him taking the workers.

427
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,856
Huntington warned him
about that.

428
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,275
I know you're not fool enough
to go after him.

what needs to be done.

- Mr. Ferguson.

Mr. Ferguson!

434
00:30:21,836 --> 00:30:24,455
Going after him is suicide.

435
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:25,956
Look around you.

436
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:29,009
Do you want to face
those men again, alone?

437
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:31,545
I'm gonna keep my word
to Bohannon.

438

Uh...

00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,462
Mrs. Toole will be
leaving us, I'm afraid.

What do you mean?

447
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:09,449
Well, the woman's a whore,
Miss Ellison.

448
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:14,638
Mrs. Toole is not a whore.

449
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,173
And even if she were,
I expect that

450
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,641
to be as little concern to you

451
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,394

are to me.

Prior to becoming
Mr. Mortimer Ramsey,

00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:29,686
proprietor of this hotel,
you lived in Omaha?

Calling yourself...
ah, Dr. Henry Whitford.

456
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,609
Until the deaths
of three patients

457
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,029
hastened a name change
and a move west.

458
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,664
Clearly, you are mistaken.

459
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,116
The deaths were attributed
to an overdose

460
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,951
of "perpetual sunshine"...

461
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,286
a miracle elixir
you widely prescribed,

462
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,005
claiming it would cure
just about anything,

463
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,625
which I guess, technically,
death does, doesn't it?

464
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:55,679
I'm a newspaper woman,
Mr. Ramsey.

that, and the other.

Now, as for my guest,

467
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,636
she will be staying on

468
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,272
until she finds other,
more suitable, lodgings.

469
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:07,307
Are we clear on that?

470
00:32:07,341 --> 00:32:09,893

gives you any more guff,

you just talk to me, okay?

476
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:31,331
Let me know.

477
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,178

some tough luck.

I asked you to stay here.

What?

00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:03,390
That--that you're not worthy
of my friendship?

no charity, so...

It was me that killed
my brother, Ruth.
