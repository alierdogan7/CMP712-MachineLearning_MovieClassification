Nice town to live in.

They got no railhead,
no digging up in the hills,

62
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:52,200
no reason to grow fat.

63
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:54,267
This town eats
because Vincent Bronson

64

on the table.

don't you?

back with me

You can take his name
off the list.

83
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:46,801
He called me out.

85
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:00,667

86

Better come inside, Sam.

you can get it secondhand
from the mayor.

to the Bronson spread?

92
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,000

bounty hunter
or something?

Don't make an enemy
of him, storekeeper.

tomorrow.

dead?

101
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,534
He's dead.

I don't know
the details.

Marc was a good man
with a gun.

106
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:20,667
He was a big mouth

107
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:23,033

a good man with a gun.

108
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,100

in the ground
between the 2 of 'em.

he's all mistaken.

115

Maddox is like that?

That's too bad.

133
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:31,634
Then he's going to buy
himself a lot of pain.

134

Try him, cotton.
Talk to him.

135

Ryan's a kicked dog.

148
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,901
Well, maybe that's
what makes him

like Maddox.

There are other ways.
You buy him.

you buy the man above him.

00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:16,267
You're a soft-tongued liar.

185
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:17,734
You live in Sabbath?

186
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:21,601
Near. What... what are you
doing here?

187
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:24,334
Oh.

188
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,601
That's not
an honest question.

189
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,767
I know what
you're doing here.

190
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,934
I was in town
getting some supplies,

191
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,868
and I heard about it.

192
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:38,033
Do you think you owe me
anything, Jered?

193
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,601
Say it out plain,
Laura.

194
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,501
My man,
Hurd Price,

195
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:48,567
he's one of the men
you want.

196
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:51,968
I guess it had to be
something like that.

197
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:54,400
He work for Bronson?

198
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:56,801
No.

199
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:58,534
We have a small farm

200
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,434
between here
and the high country,

201
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,667
and he takes work
from Bronson

202
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:03,033
when he can get it.

203
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,834
Let him go, Jered.
He never shot anybody.

204
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:10,434
He stands with the rest.

205
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:11,567
Sorry, Laura.

206
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:13,167
The hell you are.

207
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:15,534
Nobody has to die.

208
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,767
Just tell him to come into town
and give himself up.

209
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,868
What will happen to him
then?

210
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:24,467
He'll go back to bannock
and stand trial.

211
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:26,501
Will they hang him?

212
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:28,501
Circuit judge
is no hanging judge.

213
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:31,367
In fact, a man like Bronson
could buy him cheap.

214
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:33,400
I don't... I don't mean
just the judge.

215
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:36,567
I mean the town,
the good people with the rope.

216
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:38,567
My town, Laura.

217
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:40,467
Nobody gets a mob rope
in my town.

218
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,734
You know that.
I give you my word.

219
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,234
If he comes in peaceful,

220
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,200
there will be no hurt
come to him.

221
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:49,901
You never did
give much away.

222
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,367
Would you come, Laura,

223
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:56,567
if your man hadn't
been on the list?

224
00:16:56,634 --> 00:16:58,267
No.

225
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:01,167
There's nothing left over
from before, Jered.

226
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:02,701
Good-bye.

227
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,601
He has until tomorrow.

228
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,701
I called you in 'cause
we've got trouble.

229
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,267
You remember last spring

230
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:37,901
we took a herd over
the Kiowa.

231
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:39,667
We hit a town called bannock

232
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:42,868
on the way back.

233
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:45,868
7 of us went into town.
Do you recall?

234
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:50,000
[Snickers]
None too clearly.

235
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:52,234
We shot up the town.

236
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,467
[Horses neigh]

237
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,567
Seems an old man
took a bullet.

238
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:01,334
We thought it was nothing
but a lot of broken glass,

239
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,801
but...

240
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:06,067
seems now it's a bit more.

241
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:08,167
Now, the hard point
of the matter

242
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:11,100
is there's a lawman
the name of Maddox

243
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,801
in Sabbath.

244
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:16,501
Figures to take us back
and stand trial for murder.

245
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:18,334
[Man laughs]

246
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,467
One lawman?

247
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,267
Ryan thinks he's enough.

248
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:28,067
Cotton Ryan.

249
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:31,534
Choctaw, you may not
think much of Ryan

250
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,100
as he stands now,

251
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,701
but...

252
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:40,868
in his day, you couldn't walk
in the same sun as him.

253
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:42,634
Hey, where's
Marc Corman?

254
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:44,033
Marc Corman's
dead.

255
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,501
Corman's dead

256
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:48,601
'cause he called short
on this Maddox.

257
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:51,501
Marc Corman's dead?

258
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:56,534
I called ya here to hear
what you have to say.

259
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:59,167
Well, Vern?

260
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:01,801
I don't know,
Mr. Bronson.

261
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:03,834
I don't want trouble,

262
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,334
I appreciate ya askin' us
here for our opinion,

263
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,033
but it seems to me you got
some choice, and I don't.

264
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,801
I can't go back to bannock.

265
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:13,033
If I do, my land dries up
and blows away.

266
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,033
My beef gets scattered
into the high country.

267
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,434
I don't have the hands
to keep my spread tied down.

268
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:21,601
You know I壇 see ya
right, Vern.

269
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:23,400
I'd send some of the boys,

270
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:25,868
give my mark
to cover your losses.

271
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:27,834
Thanks, and I know
you mean it,

272
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,734
but I have
to work my own.

273
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:33,000
Well, what do you
suggest, Vern?

274
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,701
I don't suggest
anything,

275
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:36,934
and I don't aim
to do anything.

276
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,133
Just stay close
and mind what's mine.

277
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,300
And if he comes
after you?

278
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,534
I'll stop him
if I can.

279
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:46,868
Stop him first
and make sure.

280
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:49,167
I didn't kill anybody
that night in bannock.

281
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:52,300
I've got no quarrel
with the law.

282
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:55,033
You, Choctaw?

283
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,033
You give the orders,
Mr. Bronson.

284
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,033
I asked for
an opinion.

285
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,133
It was an
accident.

286
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
If that lawman
wants to lean hard,

287
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,067
then I say
we set him running.

288
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:08,367
I go along with Choctaw,

289
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:10,667
but, uh, as he says,
Mr. Bronson,

290
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:13,701
you give the orders.

291
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:16,667
Hurd?

292
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:19,300
Well, then,
I壇 like to hear

293
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,167
what you
have to say, Vince.

294
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:23,167
Want your say,
Harv?

295
00:20:23,234 --> 00:20:28,033
I say we tell the lawman
to peddle his law in bannock.

296
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,334
You got all the guns
you need, Mr. Bronson...

297
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,634
just for the asking.

298
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,934
Maddox needs a lesson
taught.

299
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,400
Can I say something, pop?

300
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:39,467
Now, I wasn't
ever in bannock,

301
00:20:39,534 --> 00:20:41,067
but it seems to me
if pa here

302
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,934
is willing to pay
for the damages,

303
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,868
give the old man's family
something,

304
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:46,934
then this Maddox
has no cause to push.

305
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,334
If he does,
I think Harv's right.

306
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,033
There are 2 men
dead already.

307
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,868
That's a bit heavy.

308
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:57,467
I don't think
this Maddox runs easy,

309
00:20:57,534 --> 00:20:59,100
and killing a lawman

310
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:01,234
is a certain way
for trouble.

311
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,834
I'll talk with him.
Maybe he has a Price.

312
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:08,234
Maybe he's
a reasonable man.

313
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,534
If not, all we've lost
is a few hours.

314
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:14,067
If we decide to go back,

315
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:16,734
I値l cover
any of your losses.

316
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:19,100
Most we'd face
is a fine, anyway,

317
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:21,267
if that.

318
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:25,200
We'll try it my way.

319
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:27,267
[Speaking
native language]

320
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:29,100
Our food's been
laid out.

321
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:32,834
Vern, Hurd, will you
gentlemen be my guests?

322
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:35,968
Choctaw, show 'em where
to get washed up.

323

When it comes down
to bedrock,

324
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:40,434
my word don't call much,
does it, Vince?

325
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:43,200
I'm just hired help.

326
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:46,434
No man means
more to me, Harv.

327
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:49,667
All I致e got
is you and Jason.

328
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:52,067

yellow, dumb ladino...

all longhorn
and no brains.

and money in the bank.

332
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:02,033
That didn't come easy.

We both us put 30 years
of sweat into it.

334

on some dumb gunplay.

I don't like to see you
backing off, Vince.

337
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:17,934
You're making a mistake.

338
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,701
I don't see it that way.

339
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:24,300
Ride into Sabbath
in the morning, see Ryan.

340
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:28,534
Hear how he made out.
I want to step around this.

341
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:32,567
If Maddox is open, tell Ryan
to set up a meeting.

342
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:34,434
Send Jason.

343
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:37,267
I'm asking you.

344
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:39,968
Keep clear of Maddox.

345
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:41,767
Take Crowe with you.

346
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:58,100
It's a great life.

347
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,834
If you were
some cheap gunsel

348
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:02,100
with a big name
running out in
front of ya,

349
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,200
they'd all be
buying you drinks,

350
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:07,133

against you,

gonna tell the kids

352
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:12,234
and the ones
who weren't there.

353
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,601
But if you're a lawman,
you're a disease.

354
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,834
They need you,
but they hate you.

355
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:20,367
Comes with the job.

356
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:23,501
I saw Bronson.

357
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:24,901
He wants to talk.

358
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:26,067
Talk?

359
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:28,200
He wants to trade.

360
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:30,501
He says he's sorry.

361
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:33,534
He means it.
I know him.

362
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:36,601
He didn't know
anybody was killed.

363
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,667
He wants to make it
all good.

364
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:40,567
Something for
my pockets, too.

365
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:44,601
Why not?

366
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:47,033
You could hear
what he's got to say.

367
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,601
I just heard.

368
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,334
The old man was
just an accident.

369
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,801
They'll get a chance

370
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:53,067
to say their piece
in bannock.

371
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:54,200
Be reasonable,
Maddox.

372
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,467
Good night, Ryan.

373
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,234
There will be some dyin'.

374
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,033
It'll be their doin'.

375
00:24:24,634 --> 00:24:25,767
[Whimpers]

376
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,734
Mr. Bronson?

377
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:40,767
What are you doing
out here, Crowe?

378
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:43,067
We just brought a couple
of hundred head up

379
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,901
from Bornite creek,
Mr. Bronson.

380
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:47,133
I saw a rider,
and, uh...

381
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,701
who else is with you?

382
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:54,033
Uh, Hitchins
and Jason,
sir.

383
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,767
You and my son are about
the same age, aren't you?

384
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,834
Uh, Jason痴
a bit younger...

385
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:02,667
5, 6 months.

386
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,567
Ever been up here
before?

387
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:07,434
No, sir. I figured
it was private.

388
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:09,100
On this high ground,

389
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:13,467
you can see the whole valley
on a clear day,

390
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:18,567
from the sierras
to white wolf pass.

391
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:22,567
Now, there was the old
Comanche camp. We...

392
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:24,400
we broke 'em there.

393
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:27,634
Harvey and me
and my brothers.

394
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:30,033
Brother Jacob
died there.

395
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,067
[Coyote howls]

396
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:38,300
They were fine people,
the Comanches.

397
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:41,834
Don't ever listen to any talk
that runs down an Indian.

398
00:25:46,868 --> 00:25:51,300
We buried brother
Jacob here and...

399
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:54,267
my other brother Aaron
beside him.

400
00:25:54,334 --> 00:26:00,801
They'd had enough
of guns and killing.

401
00:26:00,868 --> 00:26:05,000
The dead
don't have much.

402
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:07,033
Crowe, did you ever
feel the world

403
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,534
turn beneath
your feet?

404
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:15,167
No, sir.

405
00:26:15,234 --> 00:26:17,667
You best be getting
back down, son.

406
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,033
Choctaw, the kid
had the edge.

407
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,667
You're sand-blind,
Jack.

408
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:35,534
You take him on,
Jack.

409
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:37,267
$5, Choctaw?

410
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,567
That's like stealing
from a blind man's cup.

411
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:40,901
That's fair.

412
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:43,167
I figure Crowe痴 just
emptied your cup, Lee.

413
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,000
What do you say,
Crowe?

414
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:47,467
I guess
about even.

415
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:48,634
Even?

416
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:50,968
Sonny, you were
way behind...

417
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:52,400
again.

418
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:55,067
The top man takes
Dekker痴 money from him.

419
00:26:55,133 --> 00:27:00,567
1, 2, 3.

420
00:27:00,634 --> 00:27:01,868
[Horse neighs]

421
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:03,467
[Shouts orders]

422
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:05,167
I want those cattle

423
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:07,234
down at the wolf pass
tomorrow night.

424
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,834
Crowe, you come with me.
We gotta go into Sabbath.

425
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:11,067
Sure, Harv.

426
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,934
Gonna fight on
that lawman, Harv?

427
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,767
Move your ass
out of here, Lee.

428
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,567
Wait a minute,
Mr. Stenbaugh.

429
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,300
I fancy a bit
of tin star.

430
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:22,701
I'll leave enough for you
to cut your first teeth on.

431
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,300
You're a gentleman.

432
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:28,100
Choctaw.

433
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:30,367
What do you think
he's gonna do?

434
00:27:30,434 --> 00:27:32,534
Chew the hell
out of that law dog.

435
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,834
Maddox.

436
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:09,534
Mr. Maddox,
Mr. Maddox, your room...

437
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:13,334
what I mean is we
are getting a regular...

438
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,234
a drummer of
women's goods.

439
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,334
And jewelry,
and, well, you see,

440
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,767
I wasn't expecting you
to be staying over,

441
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:24,067
and, well, to put
a fine edge on things,

442
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:25,734
I need your room.

443
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:28,234
You see, he always expects
to get the same room,

444
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,200
and l... I can't...
oh...

445
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:47,334
is there something
you wanted?

446
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,968
Can't say there is,
minister.

447
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:51,801
A man comes to
the house of god,

448
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:53,167
he comes to seek.

449
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:55,133
I'm not a believing man,
minister.

450
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,400
Then why have
you come?

451
00:28:57,467 --> 00:29:00,601
A man doesn't see
many churches like this...

452
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,334
in a town like Sabbath.

453
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,534
The shape of the house
of god is unimportant.

454
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:07,968
That's not so, minister.

455
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:09,968
The kind of church
a man builds to pray in

456
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,901
tells you a lot
about the man.

457
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:13,133
Further south,

458
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,868
there are some fine,
old adobe churches.

459
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:17,767
Mexican. They're
cool and dark inside

460
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:20,167
to give a man peace.

461
00:29:20,234 --> 00:29:22,868
They're made
for kneeling.

462
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:25,367
This one's made for
standing upright.

463
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:28,767
There is no easy comfort
from god.

464
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,334
Tell me, minister,

465
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,434
you must know all
the people in this town.

466
00:29:32,501 --> 00:29:35,100
Those who come to my church.

467
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,834
I don't see
a land office.

468
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,834
If I wanted to see
a map of the territory,

469
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:41,167
a map with the deed
boundaries marked on it,

470
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:42,934
who might be able
to oblige?

471
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,834
Why do you ask me?

472
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:46,767
I figured you'd be
the one man in this town

473
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:52,067
who would find it
difficult to lie to me.

474
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:54,734
Mr. Dusaine
is the legal expert.

475
00:29:54,801 --> 00:29:56,667
He takes care
of all such matters.

476
00:29:56,734 --> 00:29:58,734
Thank you, minister.
Good morning.

477
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:18,100
My, it's beautiful.

478
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:19,734
Oh! That's him!

479
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:31,601
Mr. Dusaine?

480
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,901
You have the deed maps
for this territory.

481
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:37,300
I'd like to see them.

482
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,367
And who, pray tell,
told you...

483
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:41,067
the minister.

484
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,501
Well, I知 afraid that I would
need written permission

485
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:46,834
before I could allow you
to examine such documents.

486
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:58,801
Sir! I shall call
the marshal.

487
00:30:58,868 --> 00:31:00,200
You do that.

488
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:07,334
Thank you, Mr. Dusaine.

489
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:42,067
[Harvey]
Don't try to
soften me up, cotton.

490
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,734
Doesn't your lawman
want to talk?

491
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:46,634
Take it easy, Harvey.

492
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:48,100
Yes or no?

493
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,167
Why do you want
to push things

494
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:50,601
until they break,
Stenbaugh?

495
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:51,868
Let Bronson handle it.

496
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:53,133
You gonna
mealy-mouth,

497
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,801
or are you
gonna tell me?

498
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:56,267
He won't trade.

499
00:31:56,334 --> 00:31:59,467
You can have your say
in bannock.

500
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:02,434
Did you crawl, Ryan?

501
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,601
I wasn't asked to.

502
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:08,033
I told Vince you weren't
the man to carry this.

503
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,567
Where is Maddox?

504
00:32:09,634 --> 00:32:11,033
Climb down, Harvey.

505
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,734
You can't ride this man.

506
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:14,901
Run to hell, why don't you?

507
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,767
Maddox?

508
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,501
I'm Harv Stenbaugh.

509
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:47,834
Well, lawman?

510
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:49,133
What's your name, son?

511
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,634
Crowe wheelwright.

512
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:52,701
I've no business with you.

513
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:55,434
You've got business with me.

514
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:57,100
Drop that
gun belt.

515
00:32:57,167 --> 00:33:00,434
I'm taking
you in.

516
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:02,234
No, you're not.

517
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,634
You got 2 ways
to move, lawman.

518
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:06,300
Run...

519
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:07,734
or take me.

520
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:19,834
[Gunshot]

521
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:26,033
[Horse neighs]

522
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,234
Don't make me kill you, son.

523
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,767
What are you gonna
do about this?

524
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:55,200
He's shooting 'em
down in the street.

525
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:26,467
[Harris]
You all know
why you're here.

526
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:29,868
What I want to know is
what are we gonna do?

527
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,133
He wants to know what
we're going to do.

528
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,567
Marc Corman
and Harvey Stenbaugh
were our friends.

529
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:38,167
Do we care about
our friends?

530
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:41,234
Corman's widow, my sister,
and the little ones,

531
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,167
do we care about them?

532
00:34:43,234 --> 00:34:46,267
Are we just gonna stand
around here and talk?

533
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:50,667
Talk never moved a thing
or pulled a stump.

534
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:52,334
Are we gonna stand
around and wait

535
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,567
while this killer
shoots down

536
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,234
whoever he wants
in our town?

537
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,901
He's a lawman.

538
00:34:57,968 --> 00:34:59,400
What? What?

539
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:01,000
How do we
know that?

540
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:03,400
Anyway, he ain't
the lawman here.

541
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,334
What happened
in bannock months ago

542
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,067
is of no concern
to us,

543
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:09,701
but we must respect
the law.

544
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:13,701
As your mayor, I say we
gotta protect our own.

545
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:16,234
This man has got
to be stopped.

546
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,634
What you got
in mind,
Harris?

547
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:21,167
We all go over to
the hotel, all of us,

548
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:22,868
and we go
meaning business,

549
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,234
and that means
going armed.

550
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,400
And we can tell Maddox
to get out of town.

551
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:30,667
Now, now,
wait a minute, Luther.

552
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:33,234
That sounds
like vigilante talk.

553
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,133
Shouldn't we stay
within the limits of...

554
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,033
Sam, Sam. It seems to me
that you, as mayor,

555
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,367
should be giving lead,
you know,

556
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:44,534
not trying to keep
your head on straight.

557
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:47,400
This town owes
Vince Bronson a lot.

558
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:49,801
Legally speaking,
there is a precedent

559
00:35:49,868 --> 00:35:52,100
for forming
a citizens committee.

560
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,167
Only if there's
been a breakdown

561
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:56,334
in the formal
law services.

562
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Well, Ryan is
broken down enough

563
00:35:58,467 --> 00:35:59,934
to satisfy
any precedent.

564
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,334
Moss is right,
you know.

565
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,968
We're all beholding
to Bronson,

566
00:36:04,033 --> 00:36:05,801
and a Bronson man
was murdered.

567
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:09,400
Now, we can talk till sundown
and accomplish nothing,

568
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,267
or we can act.

569
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:14,200
Now, I say that we
call off this meeting

570
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:16,267
and do what we know
is right.

571
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:18,000
Now, Luther,
let's...

572
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:20,667
anybody here who calls himself
a man who wants out

573
00:36:20,734 --> 00:36:26,868
better speak right now.

574
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,934
Anybody?

575
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,334
Well, then I think we got
our work cut out for us.

576
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,667
Oh, dear.

577
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:48,434
You know what that man
meant to me?

578
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:51,968
I held him
above all other men.

579
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:54,801
Closer even
than my brothers.

580
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:58,033
I want him, Ryan.

581
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,801
I want him broken.

582
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:03,767
I want his face
in the dirt.

583
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:05,667
And I値l hang
what's left of him

584
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:07,434
hang him for
the murderer he is.

585
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,934
I don't care how.
I don't care who,

586
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,634
so long as I知 there
to see it.

587
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:15,901
It wasn't murder,
Mr. Bronson.

588
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:17,701
I call it murder.

589
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:18,801
I was on the prod...

590
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:22,000
I call it murder...

591
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:26,267
and I want something
done about it.

592
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:29,234
The great cotton Ryan,

593
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,000
you were good
with a gun once.

594
00:37:31,067 --> 00:37:34,067
Oh, you were beautiful.

595
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:36,267
But fort bliss
was a long time ago,

596
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:41,667
wasn't it, Ryan?

597
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:45,100
I don't like men
sweating fear in my house.

598
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:49,434
You pay me, Mr. Bronson,
and I eat your dirt.

599
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:53,033
But that don't make
what you say right.

600
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,000
Get out.

601
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:56,467
When I知 finished,
Mr. Bronson.

602
00:37:56,534 --> 00:38:01,567
Leave him.

603
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:04,934
Harvey was on the prod.
He went after Maddox.

604
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,934
He put the horn in him,

605
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,067
and then he made
his move first.

606
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:09,734
Don't make the same mistake,
Mr. Bronson.

607
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:12,567
Don't go to a man
like Maddox with a hammer.

608
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:14,434
You want him.
I understand that.

609
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,467
I figured that
was your play.

610
00:38:16,534 --> 00:38:19,601
But finish that thing
in bannock first.

611
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:22,534
Go back there.

612
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:25,734
You can buy
the whole town...

613
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:31,300
and the judge
that goes with it.

614
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:33,667
Ryan...

615
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:35,067
I知 sorry.

616
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:45,834
We'll get Maddox.

617
00:38:45,901 --> 00:38:48,868
Yes...

618
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:53,100
we'll get Maddox.

619
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,534
My heart isn't in it.

620
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:59,734
God's my witness, Jace,
I wanted no more killing.

621
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:01,534
I could've bought
that town with a whisper.

622
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:04,400
Ryan's right.

623
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,868
But not now.

624
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:09,734
Harvey's death
finished any chance

625
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:15,067
of doing it
without guns.

626
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:20,167
Damn you, Harvey.

627
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:21,567
He's in
the saloon.

628
00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:22,434
Who is?

629
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:23,467
Let's go.

630
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:54,968
Which one has the words?

631
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:56,567
You're the
storekeeper.

632
00:39:56,634 --> 00:39:59,467
Luther Harris,
ain't it?

633
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:02,434
Let me say
them for you.

634
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,467
You want me
out of your town.

635
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:05,701
What happened
some other time,

636
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:07,968
some other place
ain't your trouble.

637
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:10,901
I've seen men like you
in every town in the west.

638
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:12,801
You want the law, but you
want it to walk quiet.

639
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:17,067
You don't want it to put
a hole in your pocket.

640
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:19,334
You take courage from
each other, and you come armed.

641
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,334
# [piano discord]

642
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,234
Well, there
are enough
of you.

643
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:30,534
All you need is one man with
enough stomach to die first.

644
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:36,067
I'm not leaving until
what I came for is done.

645
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,734
So if you plan
to do anything about it,

646
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:38,801
do it now or go home.

647
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:08,167
How much?

648
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:09,133
For the meal.

649
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,667
2 bits.

650
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,033
Jesus, I thought
for sure they...

651
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:21,367
#  I知 thinking
of sweet lena fair # 

652
00:41:21,434 --> 00:41:23,667
#  with deep blue eyes
and corncob hair # 

653
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:24,934
#  her voice... # 

654
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,934
good evening,
cotton.

655
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,400
Lucas.

656
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:34,367
Cards?

657
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:36,100
A dollar a point?

658
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:39,334
You know I can't run
that high, Lucas.

659
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,033
You got my note for more
than I can ever pay,

660
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,968
and still
you want to play.

661
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,167
I'm not calling in
your note.

662
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,067
I'm not a great believer
in the milk of human kindness.

663
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:57,701
You got a rope on the man
who owes you.

664
00:41:57,767 --> 00:41:58,968
Hit me.

665
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:10,300
Yours.

666
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,567
You got a weight
on your back, cotton.

667
00:42:12,634 --> 00:42:14,567
Is that the gossip?

668
00:42:14,634 --> 00:42:16,667
I've heard.

669
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:17,868
Besides,

670
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:20,334
you've been here
last night and tonight.

671
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,067
Now, you're not
an indulging man.

672
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:24,567
Call.

673
00:42:24,634 --> 00:42:26,868
A man's pleasure
talks a lot.

674
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:28,968
Now, ain't
that pretty?

675
00:42:29,033 --> 00:42:33,367
Hit me.

676
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:36,634
May I be of service,
cotton?

677
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:39,000
I got me a mess, Lucas.

678
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:42,767
And I haven't got enough
long boot to step out of it.

679
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:44,100
Let's play cards.

680
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:49,601
Well, cottontail Ryan.

681
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,801
Cottontail Ryan.

682
00:42:52,868 --> 00:42:54,467
You wanted something,
Dekker?

683
00:42:54,534 --> 00:42:55,934
Yeah,
I want something.

684
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,100
I want some more of
your cheap whiskey.

685
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:01,901
Service in your
place stinks.

686
00:43:01,968 --> 00:43:06,200
And you're a damn fool
to come here.

687
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:10,300
He smells of trouble.

688
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:11,868
I'm all right.

00:44:01,133 --> 00:44:01,968
Maddox!

691
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:33,300
I'm calling you out,
Maddox.

692
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:35,200
We've no quarrel, Crowe.

693
00:44:35,267 --> 00:44:36,567
I'm gonna kill you,
Maddox.

694
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:37,968
I'm not gonna
fight you, boy.

695
00:44:38,033 --> 00:44:39,100
Stand.

696
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:41,534
I don't plan on
dying for no reason.

697
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,534
Ease up.

00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:09,234
You cheap little gunslinger.

701
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,400
You set me up.

702
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:11,834
So help me god.

703
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:13,701
Go on for your gun.
You want a chance?

704
00:45:13,767 --> 00:45:14,801
Go ahead.

705
00:45:14,868 --> 00:45:15,734
I don't know nothing
about those shots.

706
00:45:15,801 --> 00:45:16,968
Go for your gun.

707
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:19,701
I wouldn't do something
like that. Believe me!

708
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:22,000
It came from
over there.

709
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:26,667
My town, Maddox.

00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:11,033
[gunshots]

715
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,501
[Woman]
Aah.

716
00:46:24,501 --> 00:46:25,968
[Man]
Aah!

717
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,300
Drop it.

718
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,434
Get up.

719
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:32,133
Ugh.

720
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:37,667
Aah!

721
00:46:37,734 --> 00:46:41,400
[Cotton]
Come on.

722
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:44,767
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

723
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:46,901
[Clock ticking]

724
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:20,767
Next time I see you,
I値l kill you.

725
00:47:30,534 --> 00:47:33,601
God knows I got reason enough
to want to see you dead,

726
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,767
but I hate back shooters.

727
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:37,200
If you've got nowhere
important to go,

728
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:43,534
I got a bottle
in that desk.

729
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:45,367
Dekker's on your list.

730
00:47:45,434 --> 00:47:46,534
He a Bronson hand?

731
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:50,200
Yeah. Stays close
to Choctaw Lee.

732
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,334
Choctaw's a gun hand,

733
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,234
fast and likes
his work.

734
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,367
Dekker's
a shadow walker.

735
00:47:54,434 --> 00:47:55,834
He walks big when
he's with Choctaw,

736
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:58,434
but a back shooter
inside.

737
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,167
I knew it'd be him.

738
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:01,634
I saw him in town
earlier.

739
00:48:01,701 --> 00:48:04,167
Thanks, Ryan.

740
00:48:04,234 --> 00:48:06,133
I owe you
something, too.

741
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:12,267
I feel good.

742
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:15,868
I remember you
at fort bliss.

743
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,300
Well, that's
my trouble.

744
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:20,534
Everybody remembers me
at fort bliss.

745
00:48:20,601 --> 00:48:21,901
That's all I got,
Maddox,

746
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:23,834
a bunch of yesterdays.

747
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,701
It's a long ride down
from the high country

748
00:48:25,767 --> 00:48:28,634
with stops
all the way down.

749
00:48:28,701 --> 00:48:30,133
In Abilene, I ran.

750
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,901
In Acadia city,
I hid in a cellar.

751
00:48:32,968 --> 00:48:34,133
In Monmouth,

752
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,167
the Loring brothers
made me eat dirt.

753
00:48:37,234 --> 00:48:40,234
What keeps pushing you?

754
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,367
I've been a lawman
for 20 years.

755
00:48:42,434 --> 00:48:46,234
What stops you
running sand inside?

756
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,467
I guess the question
doesn't arise.

757
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:49,801
You know, after
killing Stenbaugh,

758
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:53,200
Bronson will come
for you.

759
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:56,267
It's always the same.

760
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:57,467
You post a man,

761
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,434
he has to come into town
to prove he's a man.

762
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:02,400
You kill a man, he's got
a friend or a kin,

763
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:04,834
just has to come
against you.

764
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,868
And for no reason...

765
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:08,567
no reason
that makes any sense.

766
00:49:08,634 --> 00:49:09,767
And it don't matter
a damn

767
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:12,767
to the man
already in the ground.

768
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:16,033
Nobody wins.

769
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,834
You can stop it.

770
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:19,968
Ride out tomorrow.

771
00:49:20,033 --> 00:49:22,100
It's not a private matter
with me, cotton.

772
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,100
The law.

773
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:27,200
The honest ones carry it hard
and clean all their lives.

774
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:30,100
Behind their backs,
the others buy it, sell it,

775
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:33,434
dirty it,
tie it into knots.

776
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:36,067
Who lives longer,
Maddox?

777
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:37,167
I was out
bringing in a killer

778
00:49:37,234 --> 00:49:39,000
when the shoot-up
happened.

779
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:40,100
I could have chased
a few tracks

780
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:42,167
and let the
matter drop.

781
00:49:42,234 --> 00:49:44,267
But I知 the law
in bannock.

782
00:49:44,334 --> 00:49:45,567
Anybody who goes
against the law

783
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:47,200
goes against me.

784
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:49,467
I don't know
any other way.

785
00:49:49,534 --> 00:49:52,000
How many more
for one old man?

786
00:49:52,067 --> 00:49:54,567
I don't call
the numbers.

787
00:49:54,634 --> 00:49:56,968
Ryan, I never drew first
on a man in my life.

788
00:49:57,033 --> 00:49:58,501
That's the only way
to stay clean.

789
00:49:58,567 --> 00:49:59,634
You play it
by the rules.

790
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:01,567
Without the rules,
you're nothing.

791
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:02,868
Bronson won't
come alone.

792
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:04,734
I didn't figure
he would.

793
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:06,701
You think he sent Dekker.
He didn't.

794
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:09,167
Well, I don't know
that. Do you?

795
00:50:09,234 --> 00:50:12,167
I know Bronson.

796
00:50:12,234 --> 00:50:14,334
Either way,
it don't matter.

797
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,767
Good night, Ryan.

798
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:21,868
[Dekker]
Let me go, cotton.

799
00:50:21,934 --> 00:50:23,767
Let me go.

800
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:25,868
What's the matter
with you, Ryan?

801
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:27,667
Let me out of here!

802
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:29,501
You're through, Ryan.

803
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:32,234
Bronson's gonna walk you
into the ground.

804
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:38,667
You're all through,
cottontail.

805
00:50:38,734 --> 00:50:41,200
Calculate you got about
10 minutes, back shooter.

806
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:42,968
It'll take me 5
to get to Maddox,

807
00:50:43,033 --> 00:50:45,133
and Maddox 5
to get saddled.

808
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,334
I think he'd appreciate
a little hunting.

809
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,467
Or I can gun you down
trying to escape...

810
00:50:50,534 --> 00:50:53,701
in the back.

811
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:54,901
You won't be so...

812
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:58,901
back shooter,
anytime you want out...

813
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:00,400
you just call.

814
00:51:14,534 --> 00:51:16,067
Hold on, Crowe.

815
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:17,334
You look like
you got your teeth

816
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,167
set on edge, boy.
Now move!

817
00:51:21,234 --> 00:51:23,033
I didn't know nothing
about Dekker.

818
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,634
You don't even
interest me, Crowe.

819
00:51:24,701 --> 00:51:25,534
Where's your horse?

820
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:26,534
Tied up behind
the stables.

821
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:28,067
All right.
Let's go.

822
00:51:28,133 --> 00:51:29,567
Listen to me, Ryan.

823
00:51:29,634 --> 00:51:31,934
I didn't know about Dekker.
You ask him.

824
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,501
Well, Maddox called my name
down in front of everybody.

825
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:35,634
I ain't afraid
of him, Ryan.

826
00:51:35,701 --> 00:51:36,801
You would be

827
00:51:36,868 --> 00:51:39,200
if you had brains
enough to spit.

828
00:51:39,267 --> 00:51:41,100
Well, I figure
I知 faster than him.

829
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:42,868
Keep walking.

830
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:44,234
In every town
Maddox has worked,

831
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,100
the ground is full
of men who were faster.

832
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:47,968
Yeah. Well, I really am.
I aim to prove it, too.

833
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:49,901
It makes
a great epitaph.

834
00:51:49,968 --> 00:51:51,067
You may be faster.

835
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:52,334
You may even be
better with a gun,

836
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,767
but Maddox
will kill you.

837
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:55,601
And that's a fact.

838
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:57,067
You'd be staring up
at nothing

839
00:51:57,133 --> 00:51:59,501
before your gun
even got clear.

840
00:51:59,567 --> 00:52:01,968
I know what I知
talking about, Crowe.

841
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:03,334
You might not
rate me very high,

842
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,834
but I know men
like Maddox.

843
00:52:26,534 --> 00:52:29,267
You'd drive a man to hell,
wouldn't you, Jered?

844
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:31,400
Hello, Lucas.

845
00:52:31,467 --> 00:52:32,667
Whose day for
choosing is it,

846
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:34,501
Price or Adams?

847
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:36,234
You know this Adams?

848
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,534
I know him.

849
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:39,601
What kind is he?

850
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:41,234
I wouldn't know.

851
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,200
But I know what you're
doing is wrong, Maddox.

852
00:52:44,267 --> 00:52:46,434
You were wrong
in san Acoma,

853
00:52:46,501 --> 00:52:48,000
and you're
wrong here.

854
00:52:48,067 --> 00:52:50,367
Not from where
I stand.

855
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:52,734
You can't see
from where you stand.

856
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,767
I didn't want
to wake you.

857
00:53:09,834 --> 00:53:11,567
Where were you?

858
00:53:11,634 --> 00:53:13,601
Over at
Vern痴 place.

859
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:15,300
Sorry.

860
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:17,267
Where are you going?

861
00:53:17,334 --> 00:53:18,868
Go back to bed, Laura.

862
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:21,801
Where are you going, Hurd?
I want to know.

863
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:24,400
Go back to bed,
will you, please?

864
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,334
You're running,
aren't you, Hurd?

865
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,133
Do you have to, Laura?

866
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,000
No, I don't have to.

867
00:53:31,067 --> 00:53:32,434
Damn you!

868
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,734
Always got to push
my face in it,
don't you?

869
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:36,801
You and this
god-cursed land.

870
00:53:36,868 --> 00:53:37,934
Yes, I知 running!

871
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,200
Does that make you
happier?

872
00:53:39,267 --> 00:53:44,667
You said you'd
give yourself up.

873
00:53:44,734 --> 00:53:46,801
Well, that was before
Harv was killed.

874
00:53:46,868 --> 00:53:48,968
I'm talking
about you, Hurd.

875
00:53:49,033 --> 00:53:50,901
I don't care about
Harvey Stenbaugh.

876
00:53:50,968 --> 00:53:53,067
He doesn't make
any difference.

877
00:53:53,133 --> 00:53:54,934
Harv Stenbaugh
was my friend.

878
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,467
You hated him.

879
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:57,767
You were
frightened of him,

880
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,300
and he never cared
about anything

881
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:04,667
unless it had the
Bronson name to it.

882
00:54:04,734 --> 00:54:08,767
You lying bitch!

883
00:54:08,834 --> 00:54:10,200
You are a nobody,

884
00:54:10,267 --> 00:54:12,601
just a little nobody
to them.

885
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:14,801
I owe Vince
everything I致e got.

886
00:54:14,868 --> 00:54:16,501
You owe him what?

887
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:18,934
This piece of dirt
that wouldn't grow wheat.

888
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,467
And what do you
owe Harvey?

889
00:54:20,534 --> 00:54:22,434
He kept you on your knees
saying thank you.

890
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:25,267
Hurd, they just don't care.

891
00:54:25,334 --> 00:54:28,434
But you do.

892
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:30,167
Yes.

893
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:32,501
That's not what I see
every time I look at you.

894
00:54:32,567 --> 00:54:34,033
You know what I see?

895
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,267
I see, "you're not much,
Hurd Price."

896
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:39,434
No, not a man, like
all the men you've known.

897
00:54:46,434 --> 00:54:50,400
I didn't mean that.

898
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:54,467
Yes, you did.

899
00:54:54,534 --> 00:54:58,367
And maybe you're right.

900
00:54:58,434 --> 00:55:02,701
Maybe that is
what's in my face...

901
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,968
I don't think so.

902
00:55:05,033 --> 00:55:07,200
I've tried, Hurd.

903
00:55:07,267 --> 00:55:10,167
And I don't want
to see you dead.

904
00:55:10,234 --> 00:55:13,334
I can't go in alone,
Laura.

905
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,167
The others won't
go in now...

906
00:55:15,234 --> 00:55:17,868
not to surrender.

907
00:55:17,934 --> 00:55:20,534
Here's Vern.

908
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:25,167
But Maddox promised nothing
would happen to you.

909
00:55:25,234 --> 00:55:31,801
What did you
promise him?

910
00:55:31,868 --> 00:55:33,334
I'll be back.

911
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:42,100
[Cocks rifle]

912
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:43,334
[Maddox]
When you turn around,

913
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,934
keep your arms
straight out from the body.

914
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,434
I told you the next time
I saw you, I壇 kill you.

915
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:53,400
I knew nothing
about Dekker.

916
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:54,601
So you said.

917
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:57,167
It's true.

918
00:56:57,234 --> 00:57:02,734
I just wanted you
to know.

919
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:04,334
You ride for Bronson?

920
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,234
Yeah,
I ride for him.

921
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,868
Does he send
you out to do
his killing?

922
00:57:08,934 --> 00:57:10,968
No. And he didn't
send me out here

923
00:57:11,033 --> 00:57:12,300
this morning,
neither.

924
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:14,133
You just took it
upon yourself.

925
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,067
What for,
a pat on the head?

926
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:17,801
You killed
Harvey Stenbaugh.

927
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:19,734
You got a bad memory, son.

928
00:57:19,801 --> 00:57:21,834
Stenbaugh had it
in mind to kill me.

929
00:57:21,901 --> 00:57:24,100
He didn't have a chance.

930
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:26,667
You don't even care,
do you, Maddox?

931
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:27,834
No.

932
00:57:27,901 --> 00:57:30,200
No, I don't care.

933
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:32,767
You say he didn't
have a chance.

934
00:57:32,834 --> 00:57:34,400
He went for
his gun first.

935
00:57:34,467 --> 00:57:35,434
When he does that,

936
00:57:35,501 --> 00:57:37,701
he uses up
all his chances.

937
00:57:37,767 --> 00:57:39,200
Do I have to keep
my arms up here...

938
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:42,701
till I say different.

939
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:44,801
You liked Stenbaugh?

940
00:57:44,868 --> 00:57:46,067
Well, then
I知 sorry, Crowe,

941
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:47,934
but he had
a lot of chances.

942
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,067
He didn't have to come
into town that morning.

943
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,434
He didn't have
to cross the street

944
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:52,801
and push it
to a shooting.

945
00:57:52,868 --> 00:57:54,334
He could've
given himself up.

946
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,868
You wouldn't have
done no different.

947
00:57:55,934 --> 00:57:57,167
You're wrong.

948
00:57:57,234 --> 00:58:00,868
I wouldn't put living
down on cheap pride.

949
00:58:00,934 --> 00:58:06,701
You can drop
your arms.

950
00:58:06,767 --> 00:58:09,534
Still planning on
trying to kill me?

951
00:58:09,601 --> 00:58:11,033
I don't know.

952
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,300
But I ain't
afraid of you.

953
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:15,501
I never said you were.

954
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:17,901
Any fish in that stream?

955
00:58:17,968 --> 00:58:20,734
Some natives
and some bullheads.

956
00:58:20,801 --> 00:58:21,868
Hungry?

957
00:58:21,934 --> 00:58:23,267
I didn't come out here...

958
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:27,334
having breakfast
ain't gonna make
us friends.

959
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,267
You got another line?

960
00:58:29,334 --> 00:58:30,968
In the saddlebag.

961
00:58:42,234 --> 00:58:44,234
Ryan thinks
you're pretty good.

962
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,400
Says you could've killed me
any time you wanted to.

963
00:58:47,467 --> 00:58:49,701
I say different.

964
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:52,400
I think I知 faster.

965
00:58:52,467 --> 00:58:53,801
You asking me
who's faster

966
00:58:53,868 --> 00:58:56,100
or whether I could
kill you if I chose to?

967
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,601
Because
if it's the second,

968
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,067
the answer is yes.

969
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:06,000
You're pretty damn sure.

970
00:59:06,067 --> 00:59:08,734
I'm pretty damn sure.

971
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:11,100
You think it's a game,
don't you?

972
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:17,033
A contest
between gentlemen.

973
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:20,667
You ever kill
a man, Crowe?

974
00:59:20,734 --> 00:59:22,734
You're a cowman.

975
00:59:22,801 --> 00:59:24,534
You carry a side-gun
for protection.

976
00:59:24,601 --> 00:59:26,934
Snakes.

977
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,667
You learn to use it
sometimes fairly well.

978
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:35,267
Sometimes you
become really good.

979
00:59:35,334 --> 00:59:38,734
But you're
still a cowman.

980
00:59:38,801 --> 00:59:40,367
I'm a lawman.

981
00:59:40,434 --> 00:59:42,434
You know what
a lawman is, Crowe?

982
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:44,734
He's a killer of men.

983
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:46,167
That's what the job
calls for.

984
00:59:46,234 --> 00:59:47,300
There are nicer ways
to put it,

985
00:59:47,367 --> 00:59:49,434
but it reads the same.

986
00:59:49,501 --> 00:59:51,234
That's the difference
between us,

987
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,400
and it's all
the difference I need.

988
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:55,667
Maddox!

989
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06,067
Being fast
don't count for much.

990
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:08,300
It's what you learn
in the trade.

991
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:11,133
You read a man.

992
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,534
You believe me?
About last night?

993
01:00:13,601 --> 01:00:15,200
I don't think you'd
trail a man so hard

994
01:00:15,267 --> 01:00:20,467
so early in the
morning just to tell a lie.

995
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,634
If you're heading for
Vernon Adams' place,

996
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:24,033
better expect trouble.

997
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,434
<I>He'll be waitin'.</I>

998
01:00:26,501 --> 01:00:27,367
Good morning,
mayor.

999
01:00:27,434 --> 01:00:28,300
'Morning, marshal.

1000
01:00:28,367 --> 01:00:29,701
Nice morning.

1001
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:32,334
Just a minute,
marshal.

1002
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,634
He's left town.

1003
01:00:33,701 --> 01:00:35,767
Who?

1004
01:00:35,834 --> 01:00:38,033
He rode out
this morning, I heard.

1005
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,501
We wanna make sure
he don't come back.

1006
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:41,834
I just come
from the minister

1007
01:00:41,901 --> 01:00:43,968
and the church-going women.

1008
01:00:44,033 --> 01:00:46,868
Seems y'all got
the same complaint...

1009
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,567
but none of you
have any reason

1010
01:00:48,634 --> 01:00:50,701
for me to post Maddox
out of town.

1011
01:00:50,767 --> 01:00:52,601
I told you we were
wasting our time.

1012
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:54,634
He's running scared
of Maddox.

1013
01:00:54,701 --> 01:00:57,367
What we need is some
real vigilante talk.

1014
01:00:57,434 --> 01:00:59,567
Well, I heard
you tried that once...

1015
01:00:59,634 --> 01:01:03,934
then went scuttling back
to your wives.

1016
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,400
Maybe if you
keep trying,

1017
01:01:05,467 --> 01:01:08,367
you can find some brave man
to shoot Maddox in the back.

1018
01:01:08,434 --> 01:01:10,400
Now I suggest you
fine, upright gentlemen

1019
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:12,334
go about your business.

1020
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,067
If you can't keep
the dirt off the street,

1021
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:16,801
Ryan, we can...
and we will.

1022
01:01:16,868 --> 01:01:18,467
You're all mouth, Luther,

1024
01:01:19,868 --> 01:01:22,567
You won't do much more
than scratch yourself.

1025
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:44,400
Look, down there.

1026
01:01:50,467 --> 01:01:53,400
What is it, Vern?

1027
01:01:53,467 --> 01:01:54,734
Maddox.

1028
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:56,300
[Price]
What are you gonna do?

1029
01:01:56,367 --> 01:01:57,601
[Vern]
End it here.

[Rifle cocks]

1031
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:01,167
You sure it's Maddox?

1032
01:02:01,234 --> 01:02:02,267
I'm sure.

1033
01:02:02,334 --> 01:02:03,467
He hasn't
seen us, Vern.

1034
01:02:03,534 --> 01:02:04,734
We could get
through the pass.

1035
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:07,000
I said if he came
after me, I壇 kill him.

[Horse neighs]

1037

Come on,

Come on!

1041
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:10,467
Over there!

1042
01:05:10,534 --> 01:05:13,501
Hold him still.

1044
01:05:14,767 --> 01:05:16,367

bunch, Mr. Bronson.

Some'll be Adams'.

1049
01:05:48,634 --> 01:05:55,167
Cut out his brand
and give 'em to him.

[Moo]

1051
01:05:57,801 --> 01:05:59,300
What do you mean,
you don't know?

1052
01:05:59,367 --> 01:06:01,133
I just don't know.

1053
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,100
You knew last night.

1054
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:07,868
Oh, did I?

1055
01:06:07,934 --> 01:06:09,968
I can't figure you, Crowe.

1056
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:11,701
You ain't scared of him,
so what is it?

1057
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:13,033
Well, maybe
I just don't think

1058
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:15,200
it's the right way
to do things.

1059
01:06:15,267 --> 01:06:17,434
Maybe... I don't think
it's my fight.

1060
01:06:17,501 --> 01:06:19,801
I just don't know.

1061
01:06:19,868 --> 01:06:22,067
Maybe I don't think
it should take 4 or 5 guns

1062
01:06:22,133 --> 01:06:24,467
to go against one man.

1063
01:06:24,534 --> 01:06:26,300
He murdered Harvey.

1064
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:28,801
I know what happened,
Jace.

1065
01:06:28,868 --> 01:06:31,701
I was there, remember?

1066
01:06:31,767 --> 01:06:33,300
I thought
we were friends.

1067

I wouldn't.

01:06:39,767 --> 01:06:42,267
I just wanna think
on it.

1070
01:06:42,334 --> 01:06:44,701
Well, you better
think right...

1071
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:48,434
if you wanna ride
for this brand.

1072
01:06:48,501 --> 01:06:49,734
[Moo]

1073
01:08:31,334 --> 01:08:33,400
Your run is over,
mister.

1074
01:08:33,467 --> 01:08:34,534
Drop your rifle.

1075
01:08:49,901 --> 01:08:51,501
Now the side gun.

1076
01:09:00,501 --> 01:09:05,734
Walk ahead.

1077
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:08,400
That's far enough.
Turn around and sit.

1078
01:09:14,767 --> 01:09:17,300
You Price or Adams?

1079
01:09:17,367 --> 01:09:18,501
Adams.

1080
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:20,601
Keep one thing
in mind, Adams.

1081
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:26,267
Make it difficult,
you're a dead man.

1082
01:09:26,334 --> 01:09:27,434
Let's go.

1083
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:38,601
How did you know
who I was?

1084
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:39,934
I was in town
when you brought in

1085
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,033
Corman's body.

1086
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,667
And you thought you were
better than him.

1087
01:09:43,734 --> 01:09:45,934
No, I didn't.

1088
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,567
I didn't kill anybody
that night,

1089
01:09:47,634 --> 01:09:48,801
and I can't afford
the time

1090
01:09:48,868 --> 01:09:51,000
to go back and
stand trial.

1091
01:09:51,067 --> 01:09:52,968
I got under 100 head
and nobody but a woman

1092
01:09:53,033 --> 01:09:55,133
and my old dog
to hold down that place.

1093
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,767
If I知 gone more than
a week, I got nothing
to come back to.

1094
01:09:57,834 --> 01:10:00,400
You have no right
to take that from me.

1095
01:10:08,267 --> 01:10:09,501
Drop it.

1096
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:23,567
I told you
to drop it.

1097
01:10:33,501 --> 01:10:35,601
[Speaking native
language]

1098
01:10:45,434 --> 01:10:48,467
What do you want,
Price?

1099
01:10:48,534 --> 01:10:53,267
I just come by to pay
my respects, Vince.

1100
01:10:53,334 --> 01:10:55,133
When's the buryin'?

1101
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,000
Soon.

1102
01:10:57,067 --> 01:11:00,133
I'd appreciate it
if I could attend.

1103
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,033
You'll be welcome.

1104
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,734
Can I stay, Vince?

1105
01:11:04,801 --> 01:11:08,868
J-just for the night,
I mean.

1106
01:11:08,934 --> 01:11:11,000
You must excuse me.

1107
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:13,767
She'll show you
to your room.

1108
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:18,234
Thanks, Vince.

1109
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,667
When are you going
after that Maddox?

1110
01:11:21,734 --> 01:11:24,033
When the dead
are buried.

1111
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,834
He needs killin'!

1112
01:11:26,901 --> 01:11:29,667
No man needs killing.

1113
01:11:29,734 --> 01:11:34,000
I was only thinking
of Harv.

1114
01:11:34,067 --> 01:11:39,767
We're all thinking
of Harv.

1115
01:11:39,834 --> 01:11:42,033
It took guns
to get this land,

1116
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:45,434
guns to keep it,
guns to make things grow.

1117
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:49,067
The guns that pride
called out...

1118
01:11:49,133 --> 01:11:54,667
and each time,
we buried the cost.

1119
01:11:54,734 --> 01:11:57,701
I'll see you, Price,
at the buryin'.

1120
01:12:12,567 --> 01:12:14,167
I wouldn't think a few
beef and a scrub ranch

1121
01:12:14,234 --> 01:12:21,100
would be worth
dying for, mister.

1122
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:22,667
We're leaving.

1123
01:12:37,868 --> 01:12:39,200
[Growling]

1124
01:12:45,834 --> 01:12:48,400
[Minister]
<I>O, omnipotent god...</I>

1125
01:12:48,467 --> 01:12:51,734
alone and unbending
in thy heaven,

1126
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:53,133
accept with mercy

1127
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,300
into thy judgment
this, thy child.

1128
01:12:56,367 --> 01:12:58,868
Molded from the cold shard

1129
01:12:58,934 --> 01:13:02,033
and fired with a soul
warmed in thy presence

1130
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,901
comes forth man,

1131
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,467
to struggle
and move unbowed

1132
01:13:07,534 --> 01:13:10,767
through this harsh world
alone,

1133
01:13:10,834 --> 01:13:13,801
to be tested by life...

1134
01:13:13,868 --> 01:13:17,200
to be confused by passion...

1135
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:21,234
to be tempted
and brought down by evil...

1136
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,067
to seek for the light
that the soul knows

1137
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,234
and never turns away from,

1138
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,534
and then to return
from whence he came...

1139
01:13:28,601 --> 01:13:31,367
again, alone,

1140
01:13:31,434 --> 01:13:33,267
to stand in awed finality

1141
01:13:33,334 --> 01:13:34,801
before thy gaze

1142
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:36,868
and give account.

1143
01:13:36,934 --> 01:13:39,701
Such is man's destiny,

1144
01:13:39,767 --> 01:13:42,434
and from the hardness
comes forth a purity

1145
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,234
that soft men
can never find.

1146
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,868
Such a man was this,
our brother,

1147
01:13:48,934 --> 01:13:51,200
who now we bury here.

1148
01:13:51,267 --> 01:13:52,100
Amen.

1149
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:55,100
[All]
Amen.

1150
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:56,868
[Minister]
Now let us each man

1151
01:13:56,934 --> 01:14:02,934
unto his own god pray.

1152
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,934
And now let us sing
unto the lord.

1153
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,434

#  a bulwark

1156
01:14:17,133 --> 01:14:18,801
we should've gone
together, Harv.

1157
01:14:18,868 --> 01:14:22,868
#  our helper,
he amid... #

[dog barking]

1159
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:37,701
Hush!

1160
01:14:44,534 --> 01:14:47,200
He's not here.
I'm alone. He's run.

1161
01:14:47,267 --> 01:14:49,601
Got a prisoner here
needs a bit of care.

1162
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:51,334
Got a hole in him.

1163
01:14:57,501 --> 01:14:59,901
Vern, where's Hurd?

1164
01:14:59,968 --> 01:15:01,767
He's run free,
Laura.

1165
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:09,667
Can you get
the bullet out?

1166
01:15:09,734 --> 01:15:10,901
Not if I want
to kill him.

1167
01:15:10,968 --> 01:15:13,334
It'll have to be cut out
through the back.

1168
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:20,567
Oh, gosh!

1169
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:28,234
We can put him
in the bed.

1170
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,901
He goes outside.

1171
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,634
Get up.

1172
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:42,133
He's hurt bad.

1173
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,133
Someday I値l get a second
chance at you, Maddox,

1174
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,400
and I won't miss.

1175
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:47,133
Don't push it, Adams.

1176
01:15:53,067 --> 01:15:59,434
I've got some food
warming.

1177
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:01,834
How do you like
the Price farm?

1178
01:16:01,901 --> 01:16:03,534
Over there
we grow corn...

1179
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:05,300
for the weevils,

1180
01:16:05,367 --> 01:16:06,701
and out in back,
the potatoes

1181
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:09,868
fried black in the ground
from the sun.

1182
01:16:09,934 --> 01:16:11,701
We do own
a few head of stock

1183
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:16,534
to keep the Borefly
happy and the crows.

1184
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:17,868
It's not much,
but I guess

1185
01:16:17,934 --> 01:16:21,033
it's more than
you got, Jered.

1186
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,400
You married
to this Price fella?

1187
01:16:23,467 --> 01:16:26,501
No preachers
and no flowers...

1188
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:30,801
but I知 his woman,
Jered.

1189
01:16:30,868 --> 01:16:33,000
That food
will be done now.

1190
01:16:41,334 --> 01:16:43,434
Does he have to stay
out there all night?

1191
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:45,934
He does.

1192
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,801
You haven't
changed much.

1193
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:52,234
Not much.

1194
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:55,000
I hear canyon city's

The "golden promise."

1197
01:17:00,968 --> 01:17:04,033
Well, it had a good run
for its money.

1198
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,200
Remember Bucky?

1199
01:17:06,267 --> 01:17:08,000
Where's Bucky now?

1200
01:17:08,067 --> 01:17:10,367
He's dead.
Charlottesville.

1201
01:17:10,434 --> 01:17:12,767
Somebody named
Yancey, I heard.

1202
01:17:12,834 --> 01:17:13,968
Buck tried to
take him in,

1203
01:17:14,033 --> 01:17:17,300
gave him too much
edge, I guess.

1204
01:17:17,367 --> 01:17:20,601
And Joe Wilmot?

1205
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:23,067
Him, too.
Shot in the back.

1206
01:17:23,133 --> 01:17:24,434
Ben Tilson...

1207
01:17:24,501 --> 01:17:25,701

bill Chrysler...

1209
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,567
all gone.

1210
01:17:29,634 --> 01:17:31,734
Jack horn will
never walk again.

1211
01:17:31,801 --> 01:17:35,934
I'm sorry, Jered.

1212
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,133
A lot of candles
to light.

1213
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,200
Can I... take
something out to Vern?

1214
01:17:43,267 --> 01:17:44,167
Go ahead.

1215
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:54,767
Get me something to
cut loose from these irons

1216
01:17:54,834 --> 01:17:56,667
and a gun
if you've got one.

1217
01:17:56,734 --> 01:17:58,667
Please, Laura!

1218
01:17:58,734 --> 01:18:00,200
No, Vern,
he'll kill you.

1219
01:18:00,267 --> 01:18:01,667
No, he'll go
after Hurd next,

1220
01:18:01,734 --> 01:18:03,300
maybe kill him.

1221
01:18:03,367 --> 01:18:04,801
Now, with a gun and
him not expecting it,

1222
01:18:04,868 --> 01:18:07,234
I could stop him.

1223
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,934
Eat your food.

1224
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,133
I'll get you
another blanket.

1225
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,868
[Coyote howling]

1226
01:18:18,934 --> 01:18:20,334
Promise me
that you won't try

1227
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,868
to kill Maddox,

1228
01:18:21,934 --> 01:18:24,067
that you'll just go.

1229
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:25,434
He'd come after me.

1230
01:18:32,634 --> 01:18:35,801
It turned colder. Can I
take him another blanket?

1231
01:18:47,868 --> 01:18:51,167
Laura...

1232
01:18:51,234 --> 01:18:52,534
thanks for supper.

1233
01:19:05,067 --> 01:19:07,367
Promise me, Vern,
that you'll go.

1234
01:19:07,434 --> 01:19:08,968
Just go.

1235
01:19:09,033 --> 01:19:12,067
I got
no more run in me.

1236
01:19:12,133 --> 01:19:13,534
If you get me a gun,
I have more than

1237
01:19:13,601 --> 01:19:15,567
a better chance
to get him.

1238
01:19:15,634 --> 01:19:18,300
He'll check me again
before he beds down.

1239
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:22,367
He won't expect
nothing.

1240
01:19:22,434 --> 01:19:24,033
You've got to!

1241
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,200
I was gonna
give it to him.

1242
01:19:53,634 --> 01:19:54,634
Do you want to know why

1243
01:19:54,701 --> 01:19:56,367
I was gonna
give him the gun?

1244
01:19:56,434 --> 01:19:59,033
He's hurt,
he's a friend...

1245
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,834
there are a lot
of reasons.

1246
01:20:00,901 --> 01:20:03,434
I wanted to
because of you.

1247
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:05,601
Because there's nothing
soft in you, Jered,

1248
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:07,200
there's nothing forgiving.

1249
01:20:07,267 --> 01:20:09,000
Even this damn land
doesn't hold a man down

1250
01:20:09,067 --> 01:20:12,400
as hard as you do.

1251
01:20:12,467 --> 01:20:16,067
What made you
change your mind?

1252
01:20:16,133 --> 01:20:19,200
It wouldn't make
any difference.

1253
01:20:19,267 --> 01:20:20,667
You'd kill him
or go after him,

1254
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:23,567
or he'd kill you.

1255
01:20:23,634 --> 01:20:25,434
[Horse neighs]

1256
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:28,100
I didn't want that.

1257
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:32,834
[Coyote howls]

1258
01:20:32,901 --> 01:20:35,968
The sword of Gideon.

1259
01:20:36,033 --> 01:20:39,300
How do you see yourself,
Jered?

1260
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:41,534
What are you
asking, girl?

1261
01:20:41,601 --> 01:20:42,868
For me to let
Adams go?

1262
01:20:42,934 --> 01:20:44,868
Forget about Price,
Bronson and the rest?

1263
01:20:44,934 --> 01:20:46,033
Would that be
so terrible?

1264
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,267
You know
I can't do that.

1265
01:20:47,334 --> 01:20:49,267
You hold
the law too high.

1266
01:20:49,334 --> 01:20:51,701
You always did.

1267
01:20:51,767 --> 01:20:53,167
Would it really
make any difference

1268
01:20:53,234 --> 01:20:54,367
if just once...

1269
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:56,100
you can't play with
it like that, Laura.

1270
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:58,567
There is no
"just once."

1271
01:20:58,634 --> 01:21:00,868
Next time
it might be a friend...

1272
01:21:00,934 --> 01:21:02,901
or money in your hand...

1273
01:21:02,968 --> 01:21:05,200
or maybe you get scared...

1274
01:21:05,267 --> 01:21:08,133
and then it becomes one more
"just once."

1275
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,434
Soon you don't know
who you are.

1276
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:12,734
You can't break
the rules, Laura.

1277
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,467
Oh...

1278
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:17,901
the rules...

1279
01:21:17,968 --> 01:21:21,667
I forgot
about the rules.

1280
01:21:21,734 --> 01:21:23,968
You think they
change the killing.

1281
01:21:24,033 --> 01:21:26,067
Because you never
draw on a man first,

1282
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:29,567
you think
that really matters?

1283
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:36,868
Do you know what
they call you, Jered?

1284
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,934
"The widow-maker."

1285
01:21:50,434 --> 01:21:52,434
I have a harsh tongue,
Jered Maddox,

1286
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:56,033
and then I知 always
saying I知 sorry,

1287
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,267
and there's no use
your being out there...

1288
01:21:59,334 --> 01:22:01,767
wanting to be
in here and...

1289
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,234
me in here wishing
that you'd come to me.

1290
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:24,801
[Whispering] oh, you
took a damn long time...

1291
01:22:24,868 --> 01:22:26,868
how did you
get here?

1292
01:22:26,934 --> 01:22:28,133
Huh?

1293
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:32,400
This place, I mean.

1294
01:22:32,467 --> 01:22:36,234
After canyon city,
there was tombstone.

1295
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,033
Then I went north
to Ellsworth.

1296
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,367
That's where
I met Hurd,

1297
01:22:41,434 --> 01:22:43,434
and he brought me
here.

1298
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:46,834
Why do you stay?

1299
01:22:46,901 --> 01:22:50,300
I've used up
too many places.

1300
01:22:50,367 --> 01:22:53,767
Besides, I owe Hurd.

1301
01:22:53,834 --> 01:22:56,467
He's kind and tender...

1302
01:22:56,534 --> 01:23:00,434
when there's time
to be kind and tender.

1303
01:23:00,501 --> 01:23:04,067
He left you here.

1304
01:23:04,133 --> 01:23:06,868
He's frightened.

1305
01:23:06,934 --> 01:23:08,601
Terrible thing, to
be frightened, Jered.

1306
01:23:08,667 --> 01:23:11,200
You wouldn't know.

1307
01:23:11,267 --> 01:23:13,767
You don't leave a man
like him much.

1308
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:30,334
Come back with me.

1309
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,934
Would you quit?

1310
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,467
I've thought about it.

1311
01:23:36,534 --> 01:23:38,400
25 years
and all you've got

1312
01:23:38,467 --> 01:23:39,767
is a gun and
not enough ground

1313
01:23:39,834 --> 01:23:44,267
to throw over you.

1314
01:23:44,334 --> 01:23:48,133
Come back
to bannock.

1315
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:53,801
Laura.

1316
01:23:53,868 --> 01:23:56,801
I've always
loved you, Jered.

1317
01:23:56,868 --> 01:24:00,467
But I would rather have
this dead land and Hurd Price

1318
01:24:00,534 --> 01:24:04,067
than the cold waiting
that I壇 have with you.

1319
01:24:04,133 --> 01:24:07,434
Do you still carry
that whistle thing?

1320
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:09,501
You mean the flute.

1321
01:24:09,567 --> 01:24:10,801
Do you?

1322
01:24:10,868 --> 01:24:16,868
In the saddlebag.

1323
01:24:16,934 --> 01:24:23,234

Any free land
around here?

I asked you
a question, mister.

1328
01:25:01,601 --> 01:25:03,000
Only high up.

1329
01:25:03,067 --> 01:25:05,167
South of the river
there's some for the buying.

1330
01:25:05,234 --> 01:25:07,701
Good land?

1331
01:25:07,767 --> 01:25:09,400
Men like you
don't buy land, Maddox.

1332
01:25:09,467 --> 01:25:13,968
You don't buy it,
and you don't work it.

No.

1337
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:40,667

with his stuff.

What does a man like
that want, Lucas?

1356
01:26:58,467 --> 01:26:59,934
A name.

in bold, proud letters.

When Maddox comes back,

1359
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:08,667
you could have
big trouble, cotton.

1360
01:27:08,734 --> 01:27:11,067
If Maddox comes back.

1361
01:27:11,133 --> 01:27:12,834
He'll come back.

1362
01:27:12,901 --> 01:27:15,934
He might need help.

1363
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,167
I tell you, Lucas,

01:27:17,234 --> 01:27:21,167
if I had somewhere
to run to, I壇 run.

But I don't,
so I値l stand.

1366
01:27:24,868 --> 01:27:27,501
And the storekeeper
and his friends?

1367
01:27:27,567 --> 01:27:30,667
I don't know.

1368
01:27:30,734 --> 01:27:35,767
You knew Maddox
from before?

1369
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:40,033
You never said.

1370
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,634

01:27:41,701 --> 01:27:43,701

There's been trouble
between us.

1377

I killed a man
in san Acoma.

Maddox called it
against me,

out of town.

that's how
it stayed.

How? That's what
I wanna know, Luther.

into the street.

1400
01:29:42,634 --> 01:29:45,100
You mean cut him down,
just like that?

1401
01:29:45,167 --> 01:29:46,701
Just like that.

1402
01:29:46,767 --> 01:29:47,901
Does that bother you?

it was murder,

him a killer

What's the matter,

1411
01:30:00,868 --> 01:30:03,534
I got no taste
for it.

Ah. I had you down
for a man.

01:30:38,434 --> 01:30:40,400
When he gets better...

1423
01:30:40,467 --> 01:30:42,667
let him go.

1424
01:30:42,734 --> 01:30:44,167
Tell him he can go
back to his land.

1425
01:30:44,234 --> 01:30:45,601
The others, too.

1426
01:30:45,667 --> 01:30:48,167
Tell him it's finished.

1427
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:50,100
I'm pulling out.

1428
01:30:50,167 --> 01:30:51,868
You?

1429
01:30:51,934 --> 01:30:53,634
What happened out there?

1430
01:30:53,701 --> 01:30:56,400
Nothing happened.

1431
01:30:56,467 --> 01:30:58,968
A man like you
doesn't let go that easy,

1432
01:30:59,033 --> 01:31:00,667
not for no reason.

1433
01:31:00,734 --> 01:31:03,701
I guess I just
looked around me.

1434
01:31:03,767 --> 01:31:06,167
Anyway, soon
there'll be no more towns

1435
01:31:06,234 --> 01:31:07,901
like bannock,

1436
01:31:07,968 --> 01:31:11,601
towns that need
a gun like mine.

1437
01:31:11,667 --> 01:31:15,100
I guess yours is
the right way, cotton.

1438
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:18,767
Sit out the years.
Find a nice, quiet town,

1439
01:31:18,834 --> 01:31:21,501
one that pays
a better house toll.

1440
01:31:21,567 --> 01:31:22,901
Don't do it
my way, Maddox.

1441
01:31:22,968 --> 01:31:24,934
Quit clean.

1442
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:25,934
Buy you a drink?

1443
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,100
No, thanks.

1444
01:31:27,167 --> 01:31:28,734
[Knock]

1445
01:31:28,801 --> 01:31:30,367
Bronson just rode
into town.

1446
01:31:30,434 --> 01:31:35,167
There's 4 of 'em.

1447
01:31:35,234 --> 01:31:36,567
Who's he with?

1448
01:31:36,634 --> 01:31:38,501
His son Jason,
Choctaw Lee,

1449
01:31:38,567 --> 01:31:40,734
and Hurd Price.

1450
01:31:40,801 --> 01:31:42,534
I'd say you bought
more than you can chew

1451
01:31:42,601 --> 01:31:43,801
this time.

1452
01:31:43,868 --> 01:31:46,067
You figure you've got
a say in this?

1453
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:49,100
I wouldn't want to see you
get it in the back.

1454
01:31:49,167 --> 01:31:52,901
We've done...
too many towns.

1455
01:31:52,968 --> 01:31:54,501
You don't owe me, Lucas.

1456
01:31:54,567 --> 01:31:57,434
Well, let's say
I need the action.

1457
01:31:57,501 --> 01:32:01,033
You and I sit at the
same table, Jered.

1458
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:04,200
The virtuous
need us, but, hah!

1459
01:32:04,267 --> 01:32:07,067
They don't like
the smell.

1460
01:32:07,133 --> 01:32:08,968
[Bronson]
Maddox?

1461
01:32:09,033 --> 01:32:10,534
Damn fools!

1462
01:32:10,601 --> 01:32:12,501
I'll go out
and talk to them.

1463
01:32:12,567 --> 01:32:15,133
Leave it be.

1464
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,901
A man gets caught
in his own doing.

1465
01:32:17,968 --> 01:32:19,067
You can't change
what you are,

1466
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:20,067
and if you try,

1467
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:26,501
something always
calls you back.

1468
01:32:26,567 --> 01:32:28,834
Cotton?

1469
01:32:28,901 --> 01:32:31,434
I can't.

1470
01:32:31,501 --> 01:32:32,667
I got no stomach

1471
01:32:32,734 --> 01:32:37,567
for that kind
of shootin' anymore.

1472
01:32:37,634 --> 01:32:42,434
[Shuffling]

1473
01:32:42,501 --> 01:32:44,501
Which one is
Hurd Price?

1474
01:32:44,567 --> 01:32:46,601
The one on the end,
next to the old man.

1475
01:32:46,667 --> 01:32:48,734
Watch Lee,
on your right.

1476
01:32:48,801 --> 01:32:51,968
He's the gun hand.

1477
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:54,100
[Shuffling]

1478
01:32:59,934 --> 01:33:02,868
Crowe!

1479
01:33:02,934 --> 01:33:05,000
Please let me talk
to 'em, Maddox.

1480
01:33:05,067 --> 01:33:06,934
Jason and me were
never in bannock.

1481
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,567
We went to Abilene.

1482
01:33:11,634 --> 01:33:13,334
Hear me out.

1483
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,067
Jason and me
are friends.

1484
01:33:15,133 --> 01:33:18,467
I'll kill you if
I have to, Maddox!

1485
01:33:18,534 --> 01:33:20,133
No need to, son.

1486
01:34:01,467 --> 01:34:04,534
Whoa!

1487
01:34:04,601 --> 01:34:07,767
[Cocks gun]

1488
01:34:07,834 --> 01:34:11,400
[Gunshot]

1489
01:34:11,467 --> 01:34:13,601
[Gunshots]

1490
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:14,734
Aah!

1491
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:31,467
Oh! Ow...

1492
01:34:46,767 --> 01:34:48,534
there's been enough.

1493
01:34:59,133 --> 01:35:01,834
He's going.

1494
01:35:01,901 --> 01:35:02,701
He killed Harvey.

1495
01:35:02,767 --> 01:35:04,934
You can't let him go!

1496
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,467
Maddox!

1497
01:35:09,534 --> 01:35:10,567
It's over, Jason.

1498
01:35:10,634 --> 01:35:11,501
I don't crawl.

1499
01:35:11,567 --> 01:35:12,901
He'll kill you.

1500
01:35:12,968 --> 01:35:13,868
Get your hands
off of me!

1501
01:35:13,934 --> 01:35:15,267
I'm not afraid
of him!

1502
01:35:15,334 --> 01:35:17,567
Harvey would walk
fire for you.

1503
01:35:25,567 --> 01:35:29,434
He's my son, Maddox.

1504
01:35:29,501 --> 01:35:31,000
Don't beg him!

1505
01:35:48,167 --> 01:35:49,367
Oh!

1506
01:35:49,434 --> 01:35:51,133
Ohh... ohh...

1507
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,367
ohh...

1508
01:36:14,167 --> 01:36:15,133
ahh!

1509
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,467
Oh!

1510
01:36:17,534 --> 01:36:20,167
Oh!

1511
01:36:20,234 --> 01:36:23,300
Oh!

1512
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:24,868
Ahh...

1513
01:36:47,801 --> 01:36:49,167
[buzzards cawing]

1514
01:36:59,734 --> 01:37:00,267
[Cocks gun]
