1
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,867
There he is...
First to give up.

2
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,733
I never thought
he'd sell out.

3
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,867
I suppose he's going to
deposit all the money

4
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:50,433
He got for the herd.

5
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:54,067
How's the cattle business?

6
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,067
No sense sitting
around here all day

7
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,933
Chawin' like a bunch
of old women.

8
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:01,333
Anybody has a right
to sell out if he wants to.

9
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,300
I suppose Steve
wanted to get his

10
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:04,867
Before the price
dropped to nothing.

11
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,067
And he was going to be
the cattle king of Wyoming.

12
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:15,633
Well, the rest of you will
soon do just what he's done.

13
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,100
We're not selling out.

14
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:19,067
You just stick around
and see.

15
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:21,667
Sure, I'll stick around.
I got nothing better to do.

16
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,333
As a matter of fact,

17
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,167
I'll be here long after
you two-bit ranchers

18
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,633
Are all starved out.

19
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,600
If I were 20 years younger...

20
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:30,367
You won't live
to be 20 seconds older

21
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,300
If you keep running off
at the mouth that way!

22
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:36,400
Go ahead, let's see
how fast you are.

23
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:37,733
All right, graycoe.
That's enough.

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,067
Says who?

25
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,833
I've been wanting to talk
to you men about something.

26
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,433
Aw, we got nothing
to talk to you about.

27
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:59,600
Thanks, Steve,
for what you just did for me.

28
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,833
I didn't ask for your help.

29
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,100
Now wait a minute,
please.

30
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,567
Look, I just wanted
to tell you this.

31
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:09,067
If you can help it,
don't sell out.

32
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:10,067
You sold.

33
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,567
Now, look,
if you trust me,

34
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:13,467
You'll hold on
as long as possible.

35
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,567
How long are you
talking about?

36
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:16,933
Till next spring.

37
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:19,367
You can manage that
all right, can't you?

38
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,800
What is your scheme?

39
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,600
I can't tell you just yet.

40
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,533
We'll think it over.

41
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:49,967
Hi, Larry.

42
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,233
Hello, Steve.

43
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,300
Afternoon, Mr. mccullum.

44
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,233
Good afternoon, Steve.

45
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,500
Got a minute?

46
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,300
Of course. Sit down.

47
00:03:58,367 --> 00:03:59,267
Thanks.

48
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,900
So you've sold
your cattle, huh?

49
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:05,433
All but a few head.

50
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,133
After paying off the crew,
this is all that's left of it.

51
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,400
$8,000. Not very much
for all those steers.

52
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:17,200
Longhorns are a drug
on the market.

53
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:18,933
I was pretty lucky
to sell them at all.

54
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,400
If you'd held them
a while longer,

55
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:24,567
The smaller ranchers
might have had some hope.

56
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:25,967
Now, I don't know.

57
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,067
Hope for what?

58
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,533
For the price of longhorns
to go up?

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,400
You know better than that,
Mr. mccullum.

60
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,900
Well, something
might have happened.

61
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:38,767
Sure, but not if somebody
doesn't make it happen.

62
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,367
I'd like to mortgage
my ranch.

63
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:43,967
You'd get more
if you sold it.

64
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,500
I want to keep it.

65
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,800
Oh, I see.

66
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:50,467
Well...
It's not worth very much.

67
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:53,500
5,000 acres is
always worth something.

68
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:56,233
You were just getting ready
to buy it.

69
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,067
How much do you need?

70
00:04:58,133 --> 00:04:59,533
About $20,000.

71
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,533
$20,000!

72
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,167
You expect me to take
a mortgage for $12,000?

73
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,067
I can't do it.

74
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,700
You can cut the place up
into farms and make that much.

75
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,467
I'll let you have $6,000.

76
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:12,867
$8,000.

77
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:16,533
$6,000, Steve.
Take it or leave it.

78
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,667
I'll take it.

79
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:21,667
Make out the papers.

80
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,133
What are you planning
to do with the money?

81
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:30,933
You'll find out.

82
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,067
Hi, Bob.

83
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,900
Steve.
How was the trip?

84
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:45,500
Well, about what
you would expect.

85
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,700
I got the going rate
for longhorns...

86
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:49,600
Half cent a pound.

87
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,067
I can pay
your back wages now.

88
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,633
Thanks for waiting.

89
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,967
That's all right.

90
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:58,067
Well, thanks
for everything, Steve.

91
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,100
I'll be seeing you.

92
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,400
Now hold on.
You've still got a job.

93
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:05,100
You're still my foreman,
regular foreman's wages.

94
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,500
You don't need me.

95
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,567
You just sold
almost all your cattle.

96
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,900
And half a cent a pound,
the few you got left

97
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:12,833
Aren't worth paying anybody
to look after.

98
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,800
Climb on your horse
and come with me.

99
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:16,467
Where to?

100
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,433
Just over the hill.

101
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,200
Remember him?

102
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:38,167
Mewhhh!

103
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:41,167
It's your little crossbreed.

104
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,800
How does he look to you?

105
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:45,800
He looks fine, Steve.
He's coming along great.

106
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:48,067
Gonna have
some good steaks on him.

107
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:49,600
Yeah, he's tough, too.

108
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,667
He's as tough as any steer
we've ever grown around here.

109
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:55,133
It's going to work, Bob.
I'm sure of it.

110
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,133
Looks like you're right,
Steve.

111
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,633
It's going to take
a lot of money.

112
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,733
Did you consider that?

113
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,433
Yeah.
I mortgaged the ranch.

114
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,700
I'm leaving for Oregon
tomorrow morning.

115
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,367
I sure wish
you'd come along, Bob.

116
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,433
You don't waste much time.

117
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,133
I can't afford to.

118
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,267
I'm ready.

119
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,633
Good.

120
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,633
We'll button down the place
and we'll get packed.

121
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,867
Mewhhh!

122
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:28,433
[ Player piano plays ]

123
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,933
Where are you going?

124
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,667
I'm going to see Maddox.

125
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:54,933
Maybe he's busy.

126
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,667
He won't be too busy
to talk to me.

127
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:01,067
If it's about a job, Andrews,
I'm the man to see.

128
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,267
It's about a job,

129
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,167
But you'll probably
be working for me.

130
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,767
Oh? Sounds interesting.

131
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,467
Hmm. It is.

132
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:09,700
What is it?

133
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,533
I want to talk
to you, Maddox.

134
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,933
This is Bob Andrews.

135
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,800
Come in.

136
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:37,967
I have a proposition
for you, Maddox,

137
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:39,733
But it's confidential.

138
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,667
Mr. graycoe is
a trusted associate.

139
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:45,400
All right, Mr. Andrews.
I'm a busy man.

140
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:47,133
What is your proposition?

141
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,667
This is big, Maddox,

142
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,233
Bigger than anything
you've ever done.

143
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,500
And I'm going to be
your partner.

144
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:56,967
Yeah? Go on.

145
00:08:57,067 --> 00:09:00,267
Steve Patrick has an idea
he thinks is going to make him

146
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:04,633
The biggest cattleman
in Wyoming.

147
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,867
I can't see any advantage

148
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:07,233
In being any kind
of a cattleman in Wyoming.

149
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,767
He's bringing in a herd
of white-face.

150
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,767
He's crazy.

151
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,867
If you don't shut up...

152
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:11,933
Who do you think
you're talking to?

153
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:13,267
Graycoe!

154
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:17,633
Mr. Andrews, graycoe's
a very impulsive man.

155
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,133
I suggest you be
more careful with him.

156
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,933
Sit down
and please go on.

157
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,067
Patrick has an idea
for a new crossbreed.

158
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
He's tried it and it works.
I've seen it.

159
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,967
It's a cross
between the Texas longhorn

160
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,433
And hereford dairy cattle.

161
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,400
It's got half again
as much meat as the longhorn

162
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:32,567
And it's just as rugged.

163
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,333
These winters won't
bother it at all.

164
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,900
It'll change the whole
cattle picture in this state.

165
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:40,200
And how does Patrick expect
to keep this a secret?

166
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:41,800
He doesn't.
Once he gets started,

167
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:43,367
He plans to furnish
his neighbors

168
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,267
With all the breeding stock
they need.

169
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,800
Very charitable man.

170
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:49,733
Just what do you expect us
to do about all this?

171
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,833
Some of the ranchers
around here have quit already

172
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,433
And their land's for sale.

173
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,567
The rest of them
have mortgages.

174
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:58,267
You have enough cash on hand

175
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,667
To buy up 10 or 15,000 acres
of land and paper tomorrow.

176
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:02,967
Then we'll go ahead.

177
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,200
We? I see you're

Not a very good

179
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:08,700
You've told me a secret.

180
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,733
You've told me
how to capitalize on it.

181
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,633
Now if I should decide
to go ahead,

182
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,733
I don't need you.

183
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,200
Yes, you do.

184
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:18,133
You need the hereford cattle,
and I'll have them...

to get them?

in the morning.

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,300

to grab Patrick's herd.

190
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:30,233
That's right.

191
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,267

to do it.

like the palm of my hand.

00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,367
You've got a deal.

195
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:42,300
Now just tell me
when and where.

196
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,967
Can you furnish
about six good men?

197

Yes.

198

We'll be gone
a couple of months.

199

above canyon river.

200

I'll meet you there
when we get back.

201
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,900
Let's see, you better be there
in about six weeks

202
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,000
In case we make better time
than we expect to.

203
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,100
I'll tell you the rest
of the plan then.

204
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,300
We'll be there.

205
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,300
In the meantime,

We'll have the biggest spread
in this state.

208

Before we're through,
we'll own 50,000 head of cattle.

209
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,700
I'm curious
about one thing.

210
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,700
I thought you and Steve Patrick
were close friends.

Well, if this works out...

215
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,367
It will,
if you do your part.

216
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:28,667
Don't worry
about that.

217
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:30,667
I've got a question, too,
Andrews.

218
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,667
Just what do you figure
on doing with Patrick?

219
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,200
You don't think he's
going to sit there

220
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:37,433
While you steal
his cows, do you?

221
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,933
We'll decide that
when we come to it.

222
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,100
All right.

223
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,767
We'll meet you
above canyon river.

224
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,400
Right.

225
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,067
So we're going into
the cattle business now, huh?

226
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,833
I don't see why not.

227
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,433
Maybe Patrick's all wrong
about this crossbreed.

228
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,767
I don't think so.

229
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,767
He knows more about cattle
than anybody around here.

230
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,533
If he says it'll work,
it will.

231
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,500
And you're going
to take the gamble

232
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:06,267
And sink all that cash
in land?

233
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,967
It won't be
much of a gamble.

234
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,833
The land that's available
around here is pretty cheap.

235
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,567
And after Patrick leaves,
it'll be cheaper.

No. There must have been
quite a few of them.

a proper education.

Oh, he isn't so wild, ma'am.

to educate him.

Unless all the men
in Oregon are blind,

I'm afraid you'll
have to sleep in the barn.

A bit tender, but I reckon
they'll be all right

I reach Pendleton.

You'd better figure on
shooting your way out.

530
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,533
I'm taking three.

531
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:37,600
20.

532
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,033
Raise.

533
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,733
I'll see you...

534
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,233
See the raise...

535
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,233
And bump you 50.

536
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,233
I'll see you,
lynch.

537
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,400
I'm light.

538
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:51,900
You're always light.

539
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:54,233
A house full of 3's.

540
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,100
That makes 30 you owe me.

541
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:57,900
Put it in the book, Ben.

542
00:30:57,967 --> 00:30:59,333
How much does he owe me
altogether?

543
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,467
Well, let me see now.

544
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:04,933
That makes it $170...
$178,000 and 50 cents.

545
00:31:05,067 --> 00:31:07,200
Nothin'.
I can afford it.

546
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:13,233
Whiskey.

547
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,733
You know him, Ben?

548
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,367
Never laid eyes
on him before.

549
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,767
Mister,
you're either the law

550
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,067
Or you're
running away from it.

551
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:28,067
Which is it?

552
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:31,133
And the answer
had better be right.

553
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,567
Neither one.

554
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:34,733
I'm a cattle rancher...

555
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,133
Looking for a trail crew.

556
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,767
Now that's not
very clever.

557
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,067
This is the last place

558
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,200
Anybody would look for
cowpunchers.

559
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,767
Yeah, it's the last place,
all right.

560
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:46,400
Nobody else wanted the job
I'm offering.

561
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:48,067
We make our own jobs.

562
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:50,667
We do all right
without hiring out to anybody.

563
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:56,233
Yeah, you look it.

564
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,733
Nice clothes...

565
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,233
A good livin'...

566
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,467
Lots of money
to play around with.

567
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:07,067
Yeah, you look like
you're doing real fine.

568
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:08,700
You came in here
looking for trouble,

569
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:09,833
Didn't you?

570
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,733
Well, you came
to the right place.

571
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:24,867
Make your play, big man.

572
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:28,167
I've had a bad day.

573
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:30,467
I reckon it's
a good a place as any

574
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,067
To get it off my chest.

575
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,700
Stand still, will ya?

576
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,333
I'm gonna keep
gettin' up,

577
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,933
So you better
get your gun.

578
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:15,633
'Cause you're gonna
have to kill me

579
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,867
To keep me down.

580
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:20,100
I don't want to kill you.
I want to hire you.

581
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,067
Want to talk business?

582
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:29,233
Talk.

583
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,667
Like I said,
I'm a rancher.

584
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:34,533
I'm going to Wyoming with
a thousand head of herefords.

585
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,433
I couldn't get
a trail crew

586
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,633
Because everybody thought
I was crazy to try it.

587
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,067
Are you interested?

588
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,867
Well, any man that can hit
the way you do

589
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,900
Can't be altogether crazy.

590
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:47,600
What's your proposition?

591
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:49,433
Regular puncher's wages...

592
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,800
And a permanent job
on my ranch

593
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:55,133
After we get
the herd through.

594
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,800
Mister,
you got a crew.

595
00:33:57,867 --> 00:33:59,333
But being a stranger,

596
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,567
Maybe you don't
know about us.

597
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:02,667
Oh, I know about you,
all right.

598
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:05,433
You're mostly ex-convicts
or ex-outlaws.

599
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,133
Nobody will give you a job.

600
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,867
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
you're my crew.

601
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:12,533
As long as you do your job
and play square with me,

602
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,867
That's all I ask.

603
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:16,600
I don't care who you are
or what you've done.

604
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:19,533
You're the first man
that's talked that way to us

605
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,533
In a long time.

606
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,067
You may be loco at that,

607
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:24,733
Driving cattle backwards
on the Oregon trail.

608
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,467
But if that's what
you want us to do,

609
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,533
We'll do it.

610
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,800
We're all
pretty good cowhands.

611
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,833
I believe you.

612
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,067
Maybe you won't think
I'm so loco

613
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:35,900
After I tell you what
I plan to do with the cows.

614
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:37,400
How about a drink?

615
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,700
Uh, I'd like
to go along, too.

616
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:41,067
I can cook.

617
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:42,567
You can cook?

618
00:34:42,633 --> 00:34:44,533
All right.
Then you're hired.

619
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:50,533
There.

620
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,333
Well, you won't
need me anymore.

621
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,533
Thank you, Chuck.

622
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,733
That's fine, doc.

623
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,333
How soon will I be able
to ride again?

624
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,100
Right now,
if you want.

625
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,733
But don't overdo it.

626
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,100
Hey, let me do that.

627
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,400
Doc says I'm going
to live again.

628
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:06,400
Oh, he does?

629
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:09,567
He's healed up
very nicely, Janet,

630
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:11,700
Thanks to your care
and good cooking.

631
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:13,567
He doesn't owe it
all to me, doctor.

632
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:15,567
Steve Patrick helped him.
So did you.

633
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:17,467
Well, you're right
about Patrick.

634
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,967
There's no doubt
he saved Bob's life.

635
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:22,067
He must be
quite a man.

636
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,533
Yeah.

637
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,367
Yes, he is.

638
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:28,833
Well, goodbye.
See you soon.

639
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,567
So long, doc.
Thanks again.

640
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:31,967
Bye, sir.

641
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:34,267
You're getting to be
mighty polite all of a sudden.

642
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,367
How come?

643
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,067
Cowboys are always polite.

644
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,533
Oh.

645
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,867
Good day.
Goodbye.

646
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:40,933
Goodbye.
Bye.

647
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:42,067
[ Door closes ]

648
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,433
There's nothing wrong
between you and Steve,

649
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,467
Is there?

650
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:51,933
Well, of course not.
What makes you ask?

651
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,433
I don't know.

652
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,833
Just the expression you had

653
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,967
When the doctor said
you owed your life to him.

654
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:00,500
You didn't seem
to like the idea.

655
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:01,600
Don't be silly.

656
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,067
You know,
I got a good mind

657
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:04,600
To go out
and get myself shot up again

658
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:06,167
Just so you can
take care of me.

659
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:09,300
I enjoyed it.

660
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,533
About your recovery.

661
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,733
None at all.

662
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,067
Too soon?

663
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,600
I think so.

664
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,100
I'm sorry.

665
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:23,067
Oh, don't be.
I'm very flattered.

666
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:26,300
Janet...

667
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:28,933
Steve's going
to be here soon.

668
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:32,300
I don't want
to go back with him.

669
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:35,867
Why not?

670
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:38,333
Well, for several reasons,
but i...

671
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,800
I like it here.
I like it very much.

672
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:45,333
I want to start a new life...

673
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,733
With you.

674
00:36:50,867 --> 00:36:52,767
I'm sure that if you
explain to Steve

675
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:53,833
That you want to
stay on here in Oregon,

676
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,867
He'll understand.

677
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:57,967
But as far
as I'm concerned...

678
00:36:58,067 --> 00:36:59,433
Janet...

679
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,400
I'm in love with you.

680
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:07,167
I don't think you are, Bob.

681
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:09,200
You're just grateful.

682
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:10,700
Yes. Yes, I am grateful,

683
00:37:10,767 --> 00:37:13,467
But I'm not proposing to you
out of gratitude.

684
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:14,667
I...I need you.

685
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,100
Something's troubling you,
isn't it?

686
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:19,233
Everybody's got something
troubling them, Janet.

687
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,300
Listen to me, please.

688
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:24,633
No. I'm sorry, Bob.

689
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,300
I like you very much.

690
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:28,767
That's all.

691
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:36,767
Well...

692
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,767
I guess that's that.

693
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:56,267
Steve!
Hey, Steve!

694
00:37:57,867 --> 00:37:59,767
How you doing,
old-timer?

695
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,467
How you been, huh?

696
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:04,467
Fine.

697
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:05,533
That's good, cowboy.

698
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,100
There you are.

699
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:15,600
Good boy.

700
00:38:18,867 --> 00:38:19,800
Hiya, Steve.

701
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:22,900
Hi, Bob.
Janet, how are you?

702
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,533
Hey, you look
as good as new.

703
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,500
Better maybe, huh?

704
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:26,467
How do you feel?

705
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:27,467
I feel fine.
How'd it go?

706
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:28,733
Pretty well.

707
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,233
I got a thousand head of
the greatest-looking white-face

708
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,333
You've ever seen.

709
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,700
Janet, I hope this character

710
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:35,433
Didn't give you
too much trouble.

711
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,567
No trouble at all.
He was a model patient.

712
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:38,867
Where are all the cowboys?

713
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:41,100
They're at the corral,
Chuck, with the herd.

714
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,233
Do they all have guns
and buckin' broncos?

715
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,433
Can I see them?

716
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,867
No, I'm afraid not.
Not this trip.

717
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:48,200
Did you get
a good crew?

718
00:38:48,267 --> 00:38:49,533
Yeah, I think so.

719
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,067
They're a strange bunch,

720
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,700
But I think
they'll work out all right.

721
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:54,133
That is,
except for the cook.

722
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,433
He's a little bartender.

723
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,067
I don't think he knows
one end of the pot from another.

724
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,633
Can I talk to you a minute
before you go?

725
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,833
Sure, miss hale.

726
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,067
Hey, can you
ride all right, Bob?

727
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,500
Yeah, fine.
I'm ready whenever you are.

728
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:06,467
Good.

729
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,433
I know just
how you feel, Chuck.

730

I want to thank you
for taking care of him.

732

I'd like to
pay you, Janet.

How much do I owe you?

738

You don't owe me anything,

739
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:33,300
Because I want
to ask a favor of you.

740

A favor?

741

Yes. A big favor.

742
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:40,233
Well, I owe you
a pretty big favor.

743
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,133

on the trail drive.

744
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,333
What?

745
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,233
We've got to
get away from here.

746
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,100
I've told you why.

747
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:48,633
I can't wait until
I sell this place.

748
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,833
That might never happen.

749
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,233
And I wouldn't be
a burden to you either.

750
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,100
I'd be a working member
of your crew.

Janet, i...

752
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:57,833
You said you weren't sure
of your cook.

753
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,067
That's right.

754
00:39:59,067 --> 00:40:00,667
Well, I can cook.
You're sure of that.

755
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:01,967
Yeah.

756
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,667
And I'd expect
to be paid for my work.

757
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:07,200
Then I'd have enough money
to get to a big city,

758
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:08,600
Like Chicago or...

759
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:12,233
Janet, I'm sorry.
I just can't do it.

760

Well...

762

that just aren't allowed

765
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,867
I don't know.
It's just...

Traditional.

767
00:40:26,233 --> 00:40:28,033
A lot of things
are traditional.

768
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,167

on the Oregon trail.

Now what about Chuck?

772
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,433
The trip is
much too dangerous

in the wagon.

00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:44,267

778
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,100

a favor, Steve.

I want.

a crew of gunslingers

That he picked up
in Oregon.

Looks like
you've made up your mind

1067
00:57:10,233 --> 00:57:12,333
We can't do this
without killing Patrick.

1068

That's right.

Did you buy up the land
and mortgages like I told you?

1071

We've got all the land
we could possibly use.

1072
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:21,067
Good.

00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:23,733
Does Patrick
know about this canyon?

1075

Sure he does.

1076
00:57:24,933 --> 00:57:27,167
What better place to
turn a stampeding herd?

1077
00:57:27,233 --> 00:57:28,467
He'll think
I'm doing him a favor

1078
00:57:28,533 --> 00:57:29,733
By starting him
in there.

1079
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,733
Yeah. Good plan.

1080

in the canyon for a while,

Don't you
worry about that.

The time to
start the stampede

one more thing.

about her.

before daylight.

01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,067
Ha ha ha!

1414
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,333
There he is...

1415
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,667
First of the new strain.

1416
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:55,533
Chuck and I
want him for a pet.

1417
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,867
Pet?

1418
01:18:57,933 --> 01:18:59,533
Why?

1419
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,833
If he's the one that
brought you to Oregon,

1420
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,067
He deserves
special treatment.

1421
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,367
We owe him a lot.

1422
01:19:06,433 --> 01:19:08,700
I agree with you.

1423
01:19:08,767 --> 01:19:10,667
He's all yours, cowboy.

1424
01:19:12,267 --> 01:19:14,167
There comes our future,
Janet.

1425
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:20,867
It may be the future

1426
01:19:20,933 --> 01:19:23,833
Of every other ranch
in Wyoming.
