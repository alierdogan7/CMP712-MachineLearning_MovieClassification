00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,961
Over there!

184
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:40,161
Aah!

185
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:47,737
[Grunts]

186
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:04,978
Nope.

187
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:07,717
Uh-uh.

188
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:09,551
Where the cattle at?

189
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:11,286
Upriver.
We passed 'em off.

190
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,461
To who?

191
00:12:15,495 --> 00:12:17,995
[Cocks pistol]

192
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,965
You best tell him
who you're working for.

193
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:27,402
Chet Achison
put the gang together.

194
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:31,640
- Take me to him.
- That's him.

195
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:35,076
Oh, shit.

196
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,011
So...

197
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:39,578
What was the plan, son?

198
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:41,146
We's to ride into Omaha,

199
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,646
get paid out
at the restaurant there.

200
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:45,148
Who in Omaha?

201
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,252
It's Durant.

202
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:53,093
He's behind this.
I know he is.

203
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:54,565
I'm taking you
into the sheriff in Omaha.

204
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:57,200
You try to run,
I will kill you.

205
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,336
You understand?

206
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,706
- Yeah.
- Good.

207
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:15,718
Yeah, it'll work.

208
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:18,290
[Grunts]

209
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:19,524
Damn it, Elam.

210
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:21,492
[Bell clanging,
train horn blows]

211
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:48,530
Sir!

212
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:54,265
I believe this is yours.

213
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,303
Thank you, sir.

214
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:04,013
Can I help you, sir?

215
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:07,247
My name's Declan Toole.

216
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:10,282
I received word
of my brother Gregory's death.

217
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:14,758
I believe he'd have been
familiar in saloons.

218
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,593
Did you by chance know him?

219
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:19,429
My friend,

220
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:21,987
I was honored
to give the eulogy

221
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:24,271
at your brother's funeral.

222
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:25,538
Thank you.

223
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,340
I don't drink the whiskey.

224
00:14:28,374 --> 00:14:30,309
And you are?

225
00:14:30,343 --> 00:14:33,447
Mickey McGinnes.

226
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:35,682
- This is my place.
- Pleased.

227
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:39,320
If it's not too much trouble,

228
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:41,856
could you tell me a little
about the circumstances

229
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,893
of my brother's death?

230
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:50,203
Let's sit.

231
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,715
[Groans]
Shh.

232
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:04,420
It's the only thing I know
to stop the bleeding...

233
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:08,759
Pack her with hot rags
sprinkled with wheat dust.

234
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:10,764
Is that an Indian remedy?

235
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:12,568
No.

236
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:16,204
It's my German aunt.

237
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:18,605
It's only temporary, though.

238
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,340
[Sighs]

239
00:15:20,374 --> 00:15:21,674
One day, it'll come on,

240
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:25,376
and I won't be able to stop it.

241
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,673
What causes it?

242
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,845
[Grunts] A whore's life.

243
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:33,576
She had a good run, though.
It's almost two years.

244
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:37,790
How old is she?

245
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:39,561
19, I think she said.

246
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:42,533
Oh, my God.

247
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,135
[Sighs] Is she still working?

248
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:47,971
No.
Jack takes care of her.

249
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:50,539
He's in love with her.

250
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:54,243
They're both touched
in the head.

251
00:16:05,488 --> 00:16:08,024
[People shouting]

252
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:14,329
Ugh!

253
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:16,595
Mr. Bohannon,
your, uh,

254
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,966
your companion looks unwell.

255
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,403
Yeah, I told him not to run.

256
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:23,474
Whiskey!

257
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:32,885
Time for a little talk.

258
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:38,351
[Train whistle blows]

259
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:40,299
Now, I got 3,000 workers
to feed.

260
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,267
You got my cattle.
I want it back.

261
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,671
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

262
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,506
You hired some men
to kill my pen crew

263
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,775
and rustle my cattle.

264
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,114
Those are
very serious accusations

265
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:54,214
in a place like this, Bohannon.

266
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:56,355
See, 'cause I figure
you canceled

267
00:16:56,389 --> 00:17:00,126
the railroad's beef contracts,
and then you did this.

268
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:01,529
You're trying to starve us out.

269
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:04,132
I canceled
the railroad contracts

270
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,636
because I am no longer
in a position to sell beef

271
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,772
to the railroad.

272
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:15,312
Although,
through some new acquaintances,

273
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:18,862
I can broker a price
of $28 a head.

274
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:20,004
[Scoffs]

275
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:23,516
Shit, I wouldn't buy from you
for a nickel a head.

276
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,149
Mr. Durant.

277
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:27,217
- Sheriff.
- Who shot Bubba Wade?

278
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:29,720
Yeah, I did.

279
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:32,058
Mm, Durant hired him
and some others

280
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,891
to kill a U.P. crew
and rustle my cattle,

281
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:35,258
and I want 'em back.

282
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:37,428
You got proof?

283
00:17:37,462 --> 00:17:40,330
This one here, he's a witness.

284
00:17:40,364 --> 00:17:42,364
The judge of this town
prefers his witnesses

285
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,765
to be of the breathing kind.

286
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,199
[Chuckles]

287
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:49,399
Sheriff, this...
this is Mr. Cullen Bohannon.

288
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:51,402
He is the new head

289
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:54,772
of the Union Pacific Railroad.

290
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:57,005
He seems to have lost
his cattle

291
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,275
and is
under the mistaken impression

292
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:00,710
that I am somehow responsible.

293
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:03,677
He did the rustling.
He did the hiring.

294
00:18:03,712 --> 00:18:06,243
Mr. Durant ain't left town
in three days.

295
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:08,845
Now, Bubba here
was wanted for rustling,

296
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,680
and rustling's a hanging crime.

297
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,750
Come see me
if you want your reward.

298
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:15,619
Now clean up this mess.

299
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:19,855
Then clear out.

300
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,090
Thank you, sheriff.

301
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:30,700
How dare you come in here
and make these accusations?

302
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:34,237
I had nothing to do
with these purported murders

303
00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:36,640
and thievery.

304
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:39,076
Who do you think I am?

305
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,779
You're capable.

306
00:18:40,813 --> 00:18:43,819
You overestimate me, Bohannon.

307
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:45,453
[Chuckles] What...

308
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:47,289
All right, what the hell
are you doing out here, then?

309
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:50,260
I am a businessman
building a railroad hub

310
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:53,963
out here on the prairie.

311
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:57,035
Now get this corpse
away from my table.

312
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:03,739
This ain't over.

313
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:06,842
Indeed it is not.

314
00:19:09,677 --> 00:19:13,013
Ah, thank you.

315
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:15,981
[Clears throat]

316
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:39,377
Got to telegraph the fort,
call off Bendix.

317
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:43,149
Like putting a mad dog
back on a chain.

318
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,686
Mr. Bohannon.

319
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:48,987
Maggie Palmer.

320
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,355
I own the Circle P Ranch.

321
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,823
Quite a spectacle in there.

322
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,659
Sorry to ruin
your supper, ma'am.

323
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,994
Mm, that was
the most entertainment

324
00:19:56,114 --> 00:19:57,612
we've had around here for weeks.

325
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:59,800
I like your style.

326
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,801
Obliged.

327
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:03,201
If you'll excuse me.

328
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:04,803
I can offer you
all the cattle you need

329
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,638
for your railroad, $25 a head.

330
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:12,510
No offense, ma'am, but I know
what market prime is.

331
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,147
Kind of volume I'm looking for,
you ought to offer me

332
00:20:14,182 --> 00:20:17,084
a quarter over prime,
fixed rate, for three years.

333
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:20,884
75¢ over prime, two years.

334
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,723
50¢ over prime, three years,

335
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:26,628
or end of project,
whichever comes first.

336
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:33,204
Done.

337
00:20:33,238 --> 00:20:35,105
Why, uh,

338
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:37,340
why are you offering me a deal
that might cost you later?

339
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:39,510
Oh, I've made
the better deal, Mr. Bohannon.

340
00:20:39,544 --> 00:20:41,280
There's a range war coming,

341
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:42,750
and your railroad
is about to drive

342
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,749
right through it.

343
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:47,754
Good day.

344
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:56,692
- You saved that girl's life.
- Yeah.

345
00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:59,831
Here.
[Baby coos]

346
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:06,171
Mm.
Maybe for the time being.

347
00:21:13,274 --> 00:21:14,974
How did you survive

348
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:17,979
the life of a prostitute?

349
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:19,647
[Sighs] I was lucky.

350
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:22,886
The whoring business
wasn't too good for me.

351
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:25,589
You know, white men
thought I was dirty

352
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:27,724
'cause I'd lived
with the Indians,

353
00:21:27,758 --> 00:21:30,258
so I could only charge
cut rate.

354
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,092
[Chuckles]
I mean, don't get me wrong.

355
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:35,430
If you wanted me,
I would give you a big ride.

356
00:21:35,464 --> 00:21:40,067
But just not that many
wanted me.

357
00:21:40,102 --> 00:21:41,435
Except for Mr. Ferguson.

358
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,405
[Baby whimpers]

359
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,907
And your late husband?

360
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:49,513
Yeah.

361
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:52,750
I've heard the story.

362
00:21:52,784 --> 00:21:55,252
I reckon
between the two of them,

Well, they both loved you.

They say never
fall in love with a whore.

I'm the reason he's dead.

370
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:26,021
Ain't no two ways about it.

371
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:32,861

A word, ma'am.

379
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:12,901
So the curse has come calling.

Now ain't a good time.

381
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,247
I've come a long way.

382
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:34,850
Did you not get my letter
stating my intentions?

383
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:37,718
It was read to me, but...

384
00:23:37,753 --> 00:23:41,189
I can't marry somebody
I ain't ever met before.

385
00:23:42,858 --> 00:23:45,662
It's our custom

to marry my brother's widow,

It's not my custom.

in two.

- Can you repair it?
- Yeah.

402

We'll have to remove everything
from the wagon

to lighten it, eh?

404
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:08,282
Then I can cut the sapling

00:34:17,401 --> 00:34:19,699
'cause they ain't accepted
Christ.

545
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:22,068
Far as I know,

546
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:25,107
Indians don't believe in hell.

547
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:31,980
Then it don't matter, then.
Let's go get a drink.

[Bell clanging, thunder]

549
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:46,154
Tell ya, it was
the most brutal engagement

550
00:34:46,188 --> 00:34:49,089
since Shiloh, and I was there!

551
00:34:49,123 --> 00:34:52,258
Give it a rest, Wallace,
for crying out loud.

552
00:35:01,545 --> 00:35:05,551
This should be interesting.

553
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:07,419
That's Declan Toole.

[Sniffs]

555
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:17,400
Gregory Toole was my brother.

556
00:35:20,137 --> 00:35:22,203
I came out here to take
his child and the mother

557
00:35:22,237 --> 00:35:23,705
back to New York.

558
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:26,476
She my woman.

559
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,742
And that's my baby.

560
00:35:28,777 --> 00:35:32,244
I can't judge
my brother's choice of wife,

561
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:36,453
be it whore or Saint.

562
00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:38,158
But that baby is my brother's.

563
00:35:38,192 --> 00:35:41,425
She mine.

564
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,876
By law,
she's my responsibility.

565
00:35:43,996 --> 00:35:45,796
By blood,

566
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:49,399
she mine.

567
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:51,269
I understand
there's some doubt to that.

568
00:35:51,303 --> 00:35:54,306
Nah, ain't no doubt in my mind.

569
00:35:57,008 --> 00:35:59,976
You stay away from my family.

570
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:01,311
My brother's Irish blood

571
00:36:01,345 --> 00:36:03,849
runs through that baby's veins.

572
00:36:03,884 --> 00:36:05,451
Your blood gonna be
on this floor

574
00:36:07,521 --> 00:36:09,022
All right.

575
00:36:09,056 --> 00:36:12,095
Y'all both done said
your piece.

576
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,333
Stay away from each other.

577
00:36:16,735 --> 00:36:19,538
You must be Mr. Bohannon.

578
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:22,009
I am.

579
00:36:22,044 --> 00:36:24,946
My brother considered you
the only upright man

580
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:28,685
he'd ever met in America.

581
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:35,696
Well...

582
00:36:37,164 --> 00:36:42,002

about my family.

[Birds chirping]

584
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:02,989
Elder Dutson,

585
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:05,367
would you do me the honor
of allowing me

586
00:37:05,487 --> 00:37:06,894
to say the Grace?

587
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:08,859
Of course, Mr. Anderson.

588
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:12,092
Okay.

589
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:15,833
Thank you, Lord,
for this bounty

590
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:19,869
you have placed before us.

591
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:23,339
And thank you for bringing
this blessed family

595

601
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,273
You mind sharing a picnic
with me?

602
00:37:51,307 --> 00:37:54,077
No. Please come in.

603
00:37:54,111 --> 00:37:57,417
I was about to have lunch.

604
00:37:57,452 --> 00:37:58,820
Looks like you was
about to have yourself

605
00:37:58,854 --> 00:38:00,487
a nice bowl of dishwater.

606
00:38:00,522 --> 00:38:02,155
I made it myself.

607
00:38:02,189 --> 00:38:05,192
Yeah, and I'm sure
it was wonderful.

608
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:09,597
I know it probably
doesn't compete

609
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:14,233
with rib steak and beans and...

610
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:17,939
a hot sheaf of cornbread.

611
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:20,975
But I reckon you can
choke it down, don't you?

612
00:38:23,476 --> 00:38:27,465
We are butchering a new herd
of cattle today.

613
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:30,485
Thought you might have a taste
for some meat.

615
00:38:34,723 --> 00:38:39,093
- Mm.
- Mmm.

00:38:39,127 --> 00:38:43,664
Lot of innocent people died
'cause of this.

617
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:46,700
Lot more to follow.

618
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:52,509
Killing is a sin,
Mr. Bohannon.

619
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:55,479
There goes any appetite I had.

620
00:38:55,513 --> 00:38:57,114
Well, besides the Indians,
weren't there others

621
00:38:57,148 --> 00:39:01,546
who died at your hand?

622
00:39:01,581 --> 00:39:03,547
Thems was rustlers and such.

623
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:04,814
And you killed them.

624
00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:07,851
You're damn straight I did.

625
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:13,183
Damn it.

626
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,886
Ruth, it's my job.

627
00:39:15,006 --> 00:39:16,387
I understand that.

628
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,187
But killing them
should make you lose

629
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:21,623
your appetite as well.

630
00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:24,491
I don't take joy from it.

631
00:39:24,525 --> 00:39:25,825
A man who hates his sin

632
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,730
can be redeemed from it,

633
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:32,198
even if he can't turn
away from it.

634
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:37,899
Do you hate your sin,
Mr. Bohannon?

635

Cornbread's dry.

636
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:07,431
Then there is hope for you.

637
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:13,471
Eat.

638
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,284
The railroad headquarters
will be here.

639
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:28,519
My office will be
on the second floor,

640

the largest rail yards

Everyone and everything
that travels by rail,

643
00:40:36,223 --> 00:40:39,526
east, west, north, south,
will pass through here.

644
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:41,029
- And stay at my hotel...
- Mm-hmm.

645
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:45,035
Which will be right there.

646
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:47,039
Don't you think that's
a little close to the bank?

647
00:40:47,074 --> 00:40:50,407
I choose the location
of my hotel and its design.

648
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:53,810
It's going to have
a cascading staircase.

649
00:40:53,844 --> 00:40:56,080
Perhaps it would be better
over there,

650
00:40:56,114 --> 00:40:57,381
by the merchant square.

651
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:58,883
No.

652
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,986
It will be exactly
where I'm indicating,

653
00:41:01,021 --> 00:41:03,888
according to the terms
of my sale to you.

654
00:41:03,923 --> 00:41:06,824
You should read
those documents carefully.

655
00:41:06,858 --> 00:41:08,927
Of course.

656
00:41:08,962 --> 00:41:10,797
I've only read
about cascading staircases,

657
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:13,796
but I understand that the ladies
like to come down them

658
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,599
in their ball gowns.

659
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:18,401
Is that true, Thomas?

660
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:22,070
Well, it does lend a lady
a certain ethereal charm

661
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:25,004
to descend such a staircase
on the arm

662
00:41:25,038 --> 00:41:26,339
of a handsome man.

663
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:27,976
At least, that has been
my experience.

664
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:31,811
Hmm, well, then you will have
to build a ballroom.

665
00:41:31,846 --> 00:41:33,312
And I will have to learn
to dance

666
00:41:33,347 --> 00:41:36,116
something
other than the Horny Toad Stomp.

[Laughs] Yes, indeed, Maggie.

668
00:41:39,387 --> 00:41:42,654
Although I suspect
the Horny Toad Stomp

669
00:41:42,688 --> 00:41:44,757
is not without its charms.
