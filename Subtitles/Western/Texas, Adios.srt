1
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,271
Get up!

2
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,650
You shouldn't go looking for fights.

3
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,755
I have to do it.

4
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,694
You're talking to a bounty killer.

5
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,669
I reckon you know what
the star stands for.

6
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,096
It means I don't need
bounty killers around here.

7
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,432
And the reward?

8
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,137
I'll take it. It goes to a worthy cause.

9
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,649
It goes into your pocket,
Sheriff, right?

10
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,110
I'm glad you understand.

11
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,299
Jim!

12
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,470
Jim! Jim!

13
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,013
Your brother just got another
one of the bandits, alive!

14
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,974
He's looking for you!

15
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:56,385
Give Margie a kiss for
me and get on home!

16
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:13,699
Two bandits this month, nine
in a year. This is the tenth one.

17
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,702
There'll be a celebration.

18
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,274
They didn't have one last time.
Bill Slattery was killed.

19
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,209
This time the whole
town's gonna go wild!

20
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,909
I gotta get going.

21
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,507
There's gonna be
a celebration, Margie.

22
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,553
- See you tonight, Margie.
- Jim!

23
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,027
I'm sorry, Dick, but I have to leave.

24
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,628
- You can make my excuses.
- What'll I say?

25
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,300
I don't know.

26
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,474
Dick...

27
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,178
...keep an eye on Jim.

28
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,711
My brother's still just a kid.

29
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,244
Don't worry, Bert.

30
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:04,026
- You know, you're pretty good.
- What are you doing here?

31
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,328
It ain't nice to leave town without
saying good-bye to a fellow.

32
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,961
- Where are you going?
- I'm going with you.

33
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,544
I ain't going to White Rock.

34
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,421
Why aren't you going to White Rock?

35
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,987
Jim, when I was seven years old,
our father was murdered...

36
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:43,424
...and the fellow who did it
will be brought to justice.

37
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,230
I'm gonna see to that. It's an
old score and I want to pay it...

38
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,499
...once and for all.

39
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,141
Okay. Where exactly
will we be heading?

40
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,503
No, I'm going alone.

41
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,974
He was my Dad too.

42
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,445
It's too much of a risk.
You're too young.

43
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,482
You were younger than I am, when
you first caught Sam Guildmore.

44
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,950
Sure you wanna come?

45
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,188
You bet.

46
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,038
- Where will we be heading?
- Mexico.

47
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,098
Mexico?

48
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,425
On the other side is Sierra Mojada.

49
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,131
I want pesos.
Two hundred dollars worth.

50
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,403
Dollars? One moment, sir.
Please, one moment.

51
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,942
Did you say dollars?

52
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,317
The bank is always
glad to get dollars.

53
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,551
Yes, the bank is always glad.

54
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:20,049
It comes to 2,400 pesos, sir.
Thank you very much.

55
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,657
Do you know anyone called...

56
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,086
...Cisco Delgado?

57
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,557
Do you know Cisco Delgado?

58
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:47,478
Yes, I know the name.
But I've never met senor Delgado.

59
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,376
He's never been to Sierra Mojada.

60
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,144
Now, if the bank can be
of any further use to you?

61
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,636
Halt!

62
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,702
Forward!

63
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,460
Like the entertainment?

64
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,536
Why did you kill them?

65
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,436
It's the way I punish thieves.

66
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,176
You murdered them for stealing?

67
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,640
I may have had other reasons.

68
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:16,222
That's the way I do things, stranger.

69
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,930
Ask if he knows Cisco Delgado.

70
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:26,404
He doesn't know him.
Nobody knows him.

71
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,163
Take it easy.

72
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,272
It's powerful stuff.

73
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,484
What is it?

74
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,316
Firewater.

75
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,926
Tell me, miss, do you know
a certain Cisco Delgado?

76
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,575
You didn't answer me.

77
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,179
I don't know him.

78
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,484
Wait a minute.
If you don't remember...

79
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,987
...maybe this will jog your memory!

80
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,722
You didn't have to do that.

81
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,052
He's just a kid.

82
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,192
You're just a kid, too.

83
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:25,198
Next time, mind your own business.

84
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,695
You staying or leaving?

85
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,287
My boss thinks he can help you.

86
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,383
- Who's this boss of yours?
- Mr. McCloud.

87
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,147
It's a wonderful way
to induce perspiration.

88
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,409
I'm sorry, won't you two
please sit down?

89
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,177
We don't have much time for visiting.

90
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,522
That's really too bad.

91
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,389
I know that you are Texans.

92
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:05,361
I don't want you to have
to return empty handed.

93
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,265
They tell me you're
searching for someone.

94
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:12,034
I think I recall the name
that they mentioned.

95
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:15,632
Shall we talk?

96
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,246
Yes, that's better.

97
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,947
If I asked you why you
were looking for him...

98
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,292
...you'd probably say it
was none of my business...

99
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,088
...wouldn't you?

100
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:41,955
True.

101
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,127
It's Creme de Mente...

102
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,461
...not Firewater.

103
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,039
I prefer to drink mint before lunch.

104
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,336
Is that right?

105
00:26:53,678 --> 00:27:00,106
And if I kept asking you exactly
why you wanted to see this man...

106
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:01,310
...you wouldn't tell?

107
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,047
Exactly.

108
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:09,525
Then I can't help you, despite
the fact that I'd really like to.

109
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,388
What do you mean?

110
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,689
Why do you want to see Delgado?

111
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,997
Just a minute...

112
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:33,514
...two gold nuggets.

113
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,188
They have the magic power
of granting speech to the mute.

114
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,295
Tell me why you're here.

115
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,015
Then I'll give you a little advice.

116
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,176
Take your brother and
go back to Texas.

117
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,297
Stranger, I'm afraid some dirty
vermin just stole your horses.

118
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,564
Breaks my heart.

119
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,946
Mine, too.

120
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,502
Texas is back there!

121
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,299
Is that some kind of a hint?

122
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,935
No, it's an order.

123
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:45,042
According to the laws of this territory,
the mayor has the power not to...

124
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:49,382
...admit or expel any or all strangers
considered undesirable to the state.

125
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,617
The mayor is right here.

126
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:04,329
That fellow is the lawyer and
you two are the undesirable.

127
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,336
What do you mean?
We haven't done anything.

128
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,675
What is your name, boy?

129
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:15,375
Jim Sullivan, and this
is my brother, Bert.

130
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,146
Bert, you'd better tell your brother,
and tell him right away...

131
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:25,586
...what happens when a
stranger gets too curious.

132
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:45,665
Wait. I need to talk to you.
No one will see us down here.

133
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:48,745
Suits me.

134
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,966
I'm sorry about what just happened.

135
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,131
In this part of Mexico,
there's no law, there's no order...

136
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:21,008
...only anarchy and the total
oppression of mercenary interests...

137
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,480
...of merciless tyranny and
uncontrolled power.

138
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,615
So I've found out.

139
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,349
Exactly. You've seen it.

140
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:33,418
And all because we're afraid
of one all-powerful man.

141
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:34,513
Who is he?

142
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,525
They could be following us.

143
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,359
Tell me where I can find him.

144
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,589
I don't know anything about that.

145
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,567
Wait, don't go.
Stay here and help us.

146
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,165
We're planning to
rebel against Delgado.

147
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,641
You two are Americans,
you are both free!

148
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,438
You've been through this already.

149
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,342
You understand.
Will you give us help?

150
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,308
I'd like to, I really would...

151
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:03,147
...but I'm in too much of a hurry
to wait for a revolution.

152
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,319
Good luck to you.

153
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,431
Thanks.

154
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,675
Thanks, Mr. Sullivan.

155
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,283
You drink too much, Miguel.
It's time too stop.

156
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,017
Don't tell me what to do.

157
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,220
About them two foreigners...

158
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,003
...if you want me to, I could
arrange a little accident.

159
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,333
That's something I'll do.
Adios, Miguel.

160
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,714
Are you tired?

161
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,690
Bert, when you were sheriff, didn't
you try to catch your criminals alive?

162
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,424
This ain't White Rock

163
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,956
If you're afraid, you'd better
turn around and go home.

164
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,163
Here comes a carriage.
Let's get a ride.

165
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,052
He's trying to run us down!

166
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,616
That's the first time you
ever killed any one, ain't it?

167
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,584
Yeah.

168
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,250
You'll get used to it.

169
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:24,180
Please, come with me.

170
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,561
This dollar belongs to you.

171
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:40,104
Are you still interested
in knowing about Delgado?

172
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,731
Yes, of course.

173
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,556
The horse is all yours.

174
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,947
Didn't make it? Next time, maybe.

175
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:35,119
You keep an eye on the horses,
let me take care of the girls.

176
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:42,023
If I tell you where Delgado is,
it will cost you six dollars...

177
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:45,293
...plus four for my trouble,
that makes it ten.

178
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:49,100
The girl is included in that for free.

179
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,139
In the mountains, there's a little hut
near the trail that leads to Traherra...

180
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,678
...where we'll find a shepherd named
Manuel Hernandez. He'll talk.

181
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,409
I hope so.

182
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,712
I can't understand it, Cisco.

183
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,254
Old Antonio there, refuses
to sell us his land.

184
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,287
Bad Antonio.

185
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,726
I want that land.
And I want it right away.

186
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,499
- Good morning, Cisco.
- Good morning.

187
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,944
What have you got, McCloud?

188
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:17,115
It's the collection for the month,
with the cash for those twenty girls...

189
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:20,384
...and the thirty crates of rifles.
The alcohol's on another bill.

190
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,288
Keep talking.

191
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:25,328
The land near Coberta wasn't
producing so I sold it.

192
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:29,923
The settlers of Tahona refused to
pay. I had to punish them for that.

193
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:37,436
I'll take care of the
punishing around here.

194
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,250
Do you want your sons to die?

195
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:02,497
It will be on your head.

196
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,137
Cisco!

197
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:54,613
A couple of strangers were in Sierra
Mojada yesterday, looking for you.

198
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,515
Did you find out who they were?

199
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,179
They're the sons of Jack Sullivan.

200
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:06,586
I tried to send them back where they
came from, but they wouldn't go.

201
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:10,098
But don't worry about it.
I can handle it.

202
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,131
Leave them alone!

203
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,395
Where are they now?

204
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,730
The path near Traherra.

205
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,064
Bert! There's someone down here.

206
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,697
Yeah, there's someone.

207
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,039
Whoever it is, is dead.

208
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,038
It's the girl from the tavern.

209
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,634
I knew we'd see each
other again, Yankee.

210
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,270
God did not listen to me...

211
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,413
...even though I prayed.

212
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,242
Now, I want you boys to bury the girl.

213
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:16,509
Make the grave big enough
for you and your brother.

214
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,616
You might need it.

215
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:24,050
While I'm at it, I'll make it
big enough for all of you.

216
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,300
That seem strange to you?

217
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:38,705
What?

218
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:43,345
Why didn't they try to kill us?
They had plenty of chances.

219
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,275
I don't know.

220
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:17,235
What do you want?

221
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,215
Are you Manuel Hernandez?

222
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:24,218
Arkita told us the way here.

223
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:27,254
Where is Cisco Delgado?

224
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:32,621
Wait.

225
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,006
It's not enough. Another.

226
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,074
It's enough.

227
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,417
All right. Come on.

228
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,490
Those are Delgado's prisoners.

229
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:49,003
Go with them but don't ask any
questions. Good-bye.

230
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:44,583
Juan, Juan, It's us!
Bring her out! Come on you!

231
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:49,256
No! Let go of me! Let go of me!

232
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:54,033
Take your hands off me!
Let go of me!

233
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:11,517
You dirty killers! You're just a bunch
of filthy murderers! Every one of you!

234
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:16,025
Stay where you are! Make one false
move, God help me, I'll shoot you!

235
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,988
Now get out of that wagon!
You're free! Go, you're free!

236
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:22,065
Get down! All of you!

237
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,631
You're acting like a fool!

238
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,264
Bert! What are you
gonna do about it, Bert?

239
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,907
We've got other work to do, boy.

240
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,343
Put them in with the others!

241
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:16,981
And give them a bath!

242
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,221
And you two come with me!

243
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,968
Where's Delgado?

244
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,156
Didn't they tell you not to
ask any more questions?

245
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:55,613
Yeah.

246
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,591
Then you'd better take their advice.

247
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,726
He's gonna wait here.

248
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:38,111
I've been expecting you,
Bert Sullivan.

249
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,217
You know why I'm here, don't you?

250
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,656
It's taken you a pretty
long time to get here.

251
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,625
You're going back to Texas.

252
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:29,364
You've got a score to settle with
the law and I'll see it gets paid.

253
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:54,994
I've come a long way since I left
Texas. Land, money, this house...

254
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,099
...a name that's feared
all over Mexico.

255
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,169
Do you expect me to
leave all of this behind...

256
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,365
...because you are blind enough to
confuse revenge with justice?

257
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,064
You killed my father.

258
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:13,276
That's not a good enough reason
for me to give myself up to you.

259
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:19,946
I'm taking you back
with me, Cisco.

260
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,061
No! You're going back alone!

261
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:42,033
I'll give you a chance to
get out. You better take it.

262
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,094
Where's Jim?

263
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:09,665
Why do you want to know?

264
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:14,533
Jim is my son.

265
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,716
You were a kid when I was there.

266
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,186
I wish it had never happened.

267
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,220
I couldn't forget her.

268
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,364
Not even after she died.

269
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,483
I didn't come back for Jim...

270
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:05,561
...because I knew he was with you...

271
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,557
...and would grow up to be honest...

272
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:13,534
...respected, without the taint
of being a criminal's son.

273
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,429
It wasn't an easy thing to do.

274
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,497
It was a sacrifice.

275
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,169
All the same, I did it
and I'm not sorry!

276
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:23,677
I did it for his sake...

277
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:27,349
...and now you've bought him here
to show him what his father's like.

278
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:32,952
I never wanted him to find out
what his father really was.

279
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,314
I hope you're satisfied.

280
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:20,224
Well?

281
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,335
Follow me.

282
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,155
She's pretty.

283
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,695
Dance. It's your party. Go ahead.

284
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:01,497
The party's for you, too.

285
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:16,009
Why don't you think better
than any of my men.

286
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:19,341
I'd pay a lot to a man like you.

287
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:25,579
There's a job here if you want it.

288
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:29,124
We're going back tomorrow.

289
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:32,721
Really?

290
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:38,766
I'll give you money.

291
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:41,401
Enough money to last you
for the rest of your life.

292
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:46,274
You can do that in Texas.

293
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,443
You're coming back.

294
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:57,150
That's where you're wrong.

295
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:04,250
Dead wrong!

296
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,454
Just who the hell do you
think you are?

297
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:10,191
My judge? Well, you aren't
and I'm not gonna take it!

298
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:12,963
Your father was nothing
but a cheap bandit...

299
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,661
...and your mother a harlot!

300
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,328
I said, this girl here is mine.
Don't move!

301
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,470
That's all! Go on, get out!

302
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,375
It was because of the girl.
He's the one who started it.

303
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:33,108
Sure, Jim. Sure.

304
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,482
Leave us alone.

305
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:42,219
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.

306
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,663
Take your hands off me,
you murderer!

307
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,238
Lock him up!

308
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:15,486
You had your chance
and you didn't take it.

309
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:20,085
I'm turning him over to you.
Show him that I mean business.

310
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:24,733
Give Miguel what's left of him. I want
him taken to the Texas boundary.

311
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:27,128
Good-bye, Bert.

312
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,370
Greetings from Cisco, Miguel.

313
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:11,536
He wants you to take the
American back to Texas again.

314
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:23,258
What did I tell you?
You are undesirable.

315
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:58,416
You wait for me outside.

316
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:14,239
You push this one on the floor and...

317
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,940
...I'm gonna break your arm.

318
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,973
Why is he treating me like this?

319
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:23,443
That's something I wouldn't
mind finding out myself.

320
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:56,305
Calm down.

321
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,305
You get out of my way.

322
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:25,661
Open it.

323
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:27,932
And look inside it.

324
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:42,076
It's your mother's.

325
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,558
We knew each other.

326
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,228
Don't look at me like that.

327
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,374
How did you know my mother?

328
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,451
Answer me!

329
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,891
How did you know my mother?

330
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:32,361
You are my son.

331
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,169
Take it!

332
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,206
What's the matter?

333
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:24,309
You don't want to talk?
I understand.

334
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:30,384
There is one thing, pray!

335
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:46,170
I wouldn't feel so bad
about leaving this country.

336
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:11,456
- Hello, Sullivan.
- Howdy!

337
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,668
What's this?

338
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:19,703
A bunch of lousy revolutionaries?
And a pretty poor bunch at that.

339
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,968
Your men can't shoot straight
enough to knock off my hat.

340
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:25,003
Are there enough men?

341
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:34,347
For what?

342
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:37,385
To eliminate Cisco Delgado.

343
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:50,997
Idiots! Stupid idiots!

344
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,048
You can't stop Cisco!

345
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:00,572
Are you tired of living?

346
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:05,377
Yes. Under these conditions,
who wouldn't be tired of living?

347
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:11,957
Do me a favor, stranger.
Pray for all of us.

348
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:26,931
Don't go away. You once
stood for justice and liberty.

349
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:30,539
My father told me that you
lost your wife and your sons...

350
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:34,138
...because you stood up to Delgado

351
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:35,949
Why don't you join us?

352
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:46,961
No. It's too late now.

353
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,567
What about you, Sullivan?
Will you help us?

354
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:56,597
I wish you luck.

355
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:39,045
Your gun.

356
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:42,584
Your gun.

357
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:50,448
What do you want it for?

358
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,219
You heard what Fernandez said.

359
01:13:56,165 --> 01:14:00,329
I heard that Cisco has
your brother in prison.

360
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:02,163
I'm sorry.

361
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:18,210
You're very brave to try and fight.

362
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:23,915
I admire Fernandez. He's a man you
can trust. He has the courage to die.

363
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:26,087
He knows what dignity is.

364
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,333
Good-bye, stranger.

365
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,129
Jim! Jim! Hurry! Come on!

366
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:10,700
There's no one on guard! Come!

367
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:13,701
Come on!

368
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,717
Come on!

369
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:13,965
Hold it!

370
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:31,215
No, you don't!

371
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:04,209
You shouldn't have tried that.

372
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,050
Come back here.

373
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,561
Come back here!

374
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:46,993
I'm warning you.
Get ready for an attack!

375
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:49,120
Fernandez is leading
a group of revolutionaries!

376
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:51,062
They're coming here!

377
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:55,160
- And what about Bert?
- Bert? I haven't heard anything.

378
01:17:56,705 --> 01:18:01,108
Pedro, I want the men here at once,
and all of them ready to go.

379
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,492
They're trapped at
the end of the valley!

380
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:28,657
Halt!

381
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:34,962
Here I am.

382
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,138
Did you change your mind...

383
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,145
...or did you finally decide
not to take on Delgado alone?

384
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,974
I came to tell you that you'd
better get ready for an attack.

385
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:50,243
- An attack?
- By Delgado.

386
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:53,380
How many out there?

387
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:56,049
I'm not sure. But they'll
have reinforcements this time.

388
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:04,026
I'll be ready. It's going to be a really
old-time battle on horseback.

389
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:05,459
Come along and help us.

390
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:12,232
I reckon you know a lot about the
law, but we're not in a courthouse.

391
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,466
We're unprotected now.

392
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,044
Get down!

393
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:24,413
Didn't you hear Mr. Sullivan?
Get off your horses!

394
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:57,777
When they get to that point in the
road, give the signal to fire...

395
01:20:57,986 --> 01:21:00,216
...we'll take them by surprise.
The rifle!

396
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,993
Thank you, Sullivan.

397
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:22,446
Stay where you are, Bert!

398
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,920
And put down that pistol.

399
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:35,618
Until now, I had nothing against you.
But you made me want to kill you.

400
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:40,130
I will kill you because you hate me
so. You have a reason to hate me...

401
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:41,997
...but not my own son!

402
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:26,013
Is that you, Bert?

403
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:30,908
I can't see you.

404
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:33,084
Listen to me...

405
01:26:42,463 --> 01:26:49,631
When you, when you get to Texas...

406
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:52,429
...can you hear me?

407
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:54,038
Texas...

408
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,406
...good-bye.

409
01:28:14,255 --> 01:28:16,280
All right, let's get moving.

410
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:20,690
We've got a long
road ahead of us, Cisco.

411
01:28:23,164 --> 01:28:25,223
We're going back to Texas.

412
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:27,313
We're going back to Texas.
