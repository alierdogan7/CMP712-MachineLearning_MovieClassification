00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,549
THE MERCENARY

2
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,110
<i>Paco Roman became a clown.</i>

3
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,232
<i>Better a clown living than a dead hero.</i>

4
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,796
<i>Me, Sergei Kowalski Polish emigrant,</i>

5
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,275
<i>I have always said.</i>

6
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,439
<i>Early in our history,</i>
Paco was a simple </i> peon.</i>

7
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,235
<i>But a peon like no other.</i>

8
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,469
It's Sunday.

9
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,350
It is not expected to have more to eat?

10
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,749
<i>Look, amigos.</i>

11
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,554
Today was meat.

12
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,074
He's right.

13
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,597
We are all housed in the same boat.

14
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,755
It's true.

15
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,196
Swallow it and you can endure anything.

16
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,035
People no longer speak
that of Francisco Madera.

17
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,470
- Who is it?
- A less than nothing.

18
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,310
It seems that everyone is equal home.

19
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,558
So I brought you our lunch.

20
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,553
Eat, prompted.

21
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,116
So what?

22
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,197
You're not hungry?

23
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,914
Come on, taste it to me.

24
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,714
It's good, eh?

25
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,512
He ate it.

26
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,878
He ate it!

27
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,910
Cheers!

28
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,030
<i>Stealing the rich to give to the poor,</i>

29
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,073
<i>it does not please the rich.</i>

30
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,635
I ate well so I do not care.

31
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,869
You'll find this bitter lesson.

32
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,833
As far as what did you eat?

33
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,991
Go ahead.

34
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,112
Charge!

35
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,798
- Pepote!
- Come.

36
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,275
<i>Not far away is the bar of Curly.</i>

37
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,790
<i>It is rich, powerful.
Is the boss.</i>

38
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,231
Thirty... and that's it.

39
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,872
I lie.

40
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,156
Four jacks.

41
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,868
Two ladies.

42
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,068
With those two...

43
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,034
that makes four.

44
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,754
- Are you kidding?
- In case...

45
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,359
There is this.

46
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,034
Thank you.

47
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,035
September!
Sorry, man.

48
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,919
Place your bets, try your luck.

49
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,111
Come on, we relaunch the dice.

50
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,229
September!

51
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,793
The dice.

52
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,632
The result?

53
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,068
Sept.

54
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,870
Another seven, right?

55
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,677
Do you like milk?

56
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,472
Not really, no.

57
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,677
- A glass of milk.
- It works.

58
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,753
Hold.

59
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,994
I must drink?

60
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,319
- Thank you.
- The dice.

61
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,552
Here's to you.

62
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,268
Is better.
When they emerge,

63
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,436
do you use it more.

64
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,154
Pay those who have been cheated.

65
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,790
What do you drink?

66
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,673
It's on the house.

67
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,350
The Polack!

68
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,154
If you seek me,

69
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,157
you might stay there.

70
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,839
- You'll burn your fingers.
- I have gloves.

71
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,197
I do not see them!

72
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,870
I have removed
because I shoot better without.

73
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,800
We can no longer drink a drink in peace.

74
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,032
Little scamp.

75
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,990
Hello, Curly.
Talk about a surprise!

76
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,992
I had not seen you.

77
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,752
- He is the Polack?
- It will help us.

78
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,677
The revolution will break out Mexico.

79
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,998
We have silver mines Sierra in Palo.

80
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,149
Armed gangs attack any convoy.

81
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,477
We have accumulated seven tons of money.

82
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,036
It should convey the Sierra Palo...

83
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,675
- In Mexico City?
- No.

84
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,393
My brother, Alberto Garcia,

85
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,353
wants to send money United States.

86
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,032
He is willing to pay $ 400
plus $ 100 per week

87
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,710
for someone like you,
Mr. Kowalski.

88
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,559
Why you do not ask the army?

89
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,149
My brother thinks that with you,

90
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,751
money is sure to happen United States.

91
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,151
- 1000.
- How?

92
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,278
$ 1 000 deposit, more than 200 per week,

93
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,948
more travel

94
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,195
and food.

95
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,917
- That's your money.
- The revolution has begun.

96
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,193
This is serious.
It will be a risky journey.

97
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,358
Enforcement is delayed.

98
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,553
Looks like the Poles hooked a big fish.

99
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,116
Now I am interested in Mexicans.

100
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,833
In fact,

101
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,634
you're nervous, you could miss your shot.

102
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,035
As earlier.

103
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,630
He'll pay.
I so promise, Curly.

104
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,478
Are you married?

105
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,999
I am divorced.

106
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,354
- Children?
- No.

107
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,359
All right.

108
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,637
Plays. Fire!

109
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,595
Resting.

110
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,035
Go open the door.

111
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,351
Good evening, darling. Between.

112
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,393
<i>Between amigo.
The girls are pretty.</i>

113
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,673
You are American?
Want a girl or a drink?

114
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,958
I was told that you sold weapons.

115
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,116
If I'm not mistaken.

116
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,795
Get out all.

117
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,595
This man comes to talk business
with Pepote.

118
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,552
This way.

119
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,478
I have Colt, of Winchester, the Mauser.

120
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,672
Or a nice gun.

121
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,314
- The machine gun.
- It's funny.

122
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,229
Rather, the Americans selling weapons.

123
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,829
The new model by Hawkins.

124
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,951
300 strokes per minute.

125
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,196
I bought it for a good cause.

126
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,190
But when the heart gets involved...

127
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,789
I sell everything cheap.

128
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,233
All.

129
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,469
I am the to 2,000 pesos only.

130
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,510
1000.

131
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,951
1 800.

132
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,113
1000.

133
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,238
1500?

134
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,515
- 1000 or nothing.
- Go to 1000.

135
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,429
Good morning.

136
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,154
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, Se√±or .</i>

137
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,072
Which of you order?

138
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,634
Me.

139
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,150
I am Elias Garcia.

140
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,635
This is one of my brothers.

141
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,478
Did you hear?

142
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,071
The other did not use to us.

143
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,429
I have no time to lose.

144
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,518
What mission have you given to the Polack?

145
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,399
What a Polack?
I do not understand...

146
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,430
Don Elias is shy.

147
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,312
Help him, Sebastian.

148
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,391
This valley

149
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,750
is infested with vultures.

150
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,029
They would soon devouring a corpse.

151
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,234
Where did the Polack and why?

152
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,155
Mine of Palo Alto.

153
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,909
My brother recruited him to convey money.

154
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,395
You will not need money...

155
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,994
where you go.

156
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,632
<i>Hello, gringo.</i>

157
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,637
Hands in the air.

158
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,876
Approach.

159
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,114
Gently.
Keep your hands in the air.

160
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,069
Go!

161
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,350
What are you looking here?

162
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,553
One of the brothers Garcia.

163
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,516
Alfonso.

164
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,517
He was lucky.

165
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,469
This is his cousin
who hanged himself there.

166
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,068
It recognizes the least.

167
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,317
I had to ferry the money,

168
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,556
but given the situation,

169
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,594
I assume that money
eventually into your hands.

170
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,234
What do you know about money?

171
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,998
I had to bring it through the border.

172
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,988
You know what makes this type
finally hanged?

173
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,074
Not?

174
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,998
I'll show you.

175
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,273
Look.

176
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,552
Here the mine where the money

177
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,991
and there, the gentleman
detonated dynamite.

178
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,510
An entire mountain

179
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,950
separates us money now.

180
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,316
I did hang

181
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,709
and I dig.

182
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,957
- How many are you?
- Twelve.

183
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,879
Paco Roman and his twelve apostles.

184
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,350
You should stir.

185
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,189
Working 24 hours 24,

186
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,436
you will...

187
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,471
ten years, to pretty much.

188
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,228
Where are you going?

189
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,554
I go out.
My task is finished.

190
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,433
It's a strange story
which begins with a treasure

191
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,319
which disappears when they found it.

192
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,915
You speak well.

193
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,273
As a priest.

194
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,391
Or a high-flying swindler.

195
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,033
I know the crooks,

196
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,196
they do not talk like you.

197
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,513
Who are you?
You're fast.

198
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,153
Who are you?

199
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,679
Sergei Polish.

200
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,111
If they keep me out, I'll kill you.

201
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,788
It will not help.

202
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,992
They do not care you kill me or not.

203
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,869
- You know count to ten?
- Yes.

204
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,312
I know also add, subtract and divide.

205
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,393
Fine.

206
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,272
Starts counting.

207
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,392
I want to just ten, they drop their guns.

208
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,431
One, two, three...

209
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,478
The guys...

210
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,195
Good going...

211
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,391
What have we here?

212
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,908
Decidedly, you have no chance.

213
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,314
Why?

214
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,798
What does it say?

215
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,118
It is addressed to Garcia.

216
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,073
A whole troop of soldiers is underway.

217
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,236
Guess who's headed?

218
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,954
A Garcia.

219
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,310
Colonel Alfonso Garcia.

220
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,589
It's a trap.

221
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,356
A machine gun.

222
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,474
You, there!

223
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,077
Come!

224
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,228
Come and help me to assemble it!

225
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,356
I do not work for nothing.

226
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,480
You are willing to pay?

227
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,915
- How?
- 200.

228
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,952
Sort of...

229
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,238
Well, here it is, your money.

230
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,037
Profiteer!

231
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,998
I take over.
Rafael!

232
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,232
Provides ammunition.

233
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,991
It will do nothing against their guns.

234
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,871
How does it work?

235
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,395
You, you know how to use it!

236
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,591
Draw is not assembled.

237
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,755
200 more.

238
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,479
All right.

239
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,192
Here, 200!

240
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,748
We have them.

241
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,110
First line, load!

242
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,829
We need to find dynamite.

243
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,519
There must have.

244
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,835
Will see in the mine.

245
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,156
Okay. Roberto.

246
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,839
- Put it here.
- What for?

247
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,508
They believe it has more ammunition.

248
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,315
Go!

249
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,752
They no longer fire.

250
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,154
Attack.

251
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,910
Hurry up and up.

252
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,916
What for?

253
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,235
Confront the army,

254
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,271
but to our advantage.

255
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,473
- It goes where?
- Right on the guns.

256
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,399
Jumps.

257
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,594
<i>Cheers, gringo!</i>

258
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,195
You're a military genius.

259
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,951
The only one helping me.

260
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,756
I almost get you down!

261
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,077
You would not have helped me
against these bastards.

262
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,678
You would have killed anyone.

263
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,394
I had my gun in your back.

264
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,916
Yes.

265
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,111
I was wondering...

266
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,834
<i>Why gringo does not kill me?</i>

267
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,553
I thought...

268
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,276
I thought...

269
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,118
It is not on their side?

270
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,880
I'm on one side:
Mine.

271
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,160
You have praised my services.
What's more...

272
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,157
I pity you.

273
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,513
I have no need for me to complain.
Do not repeat it.

274
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,234
One day you'll lose your head.

275
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,279
That annoy me have to complain too

276
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,754
when you're dead.

277
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,914
You talk as fast you pull.

278
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,276
Cheers, guys!

279
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,553
<i>Here's to you, gringo.
Long live the revolution!</i>

280
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,476
What it is?

281
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,752
To kill the leaders to strip.

282
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,877
There is not that much, right?

283
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,595
The speech this is not my forte.

284
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,240
I saw my father die in these mines.

285
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,836
My brother also.

286
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,354
But not me.

287
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,471
I'll die not in there.

288
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,517
I will make the revolution.

289
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,757
I'm doing well, right?

290
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,559
No.

291
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,676
I was given this for you.

292
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,272
You have learned the rules?

293
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,196
When one follows the rules,

294
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,234
you lose.

295
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,832
You travel light.

296
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,519
Where is the money?

297
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,118
I paid dearly for that information.

298
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,399
Do not you, Curly?

299
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,000
You're wasting your time.

300
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,952
Forget the money.

301
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,071
You're a hard, Polack.

302
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,717
But I know how

303
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,717
soften people,

304
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,831
even people like you.

305
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,356
You'll see.

306
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,072
Let's go.

307
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,710
Sebastian!

308
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,956
We've been looking for breakfast.

309
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,878
Why you left so early?

310
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,709
I'm an early riser.

311
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,074
I have not forgotten the money.

312
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,155
I need you alive.

313
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,998
But not him.

314
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,952
It makes what?

315
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,757
I would take him his boots...

316
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,473
and everything else.

317
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,436
Good idea. Go ahead!

318
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,875
Enough is enough.

319
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,671
Let him enough to go home.

320
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,518
Naked, it must be hideous.

321
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,789
Queue.

322
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,673
He told you to spin.

323
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,959
We'll Meet Again

324
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,794
and I will kill you...

325
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,034
Mexican.

326
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,070
Fits well.

327
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,154
I want the machine gun.

328
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,990
- Anything else?
- You are a clever, you.

329
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,995
We could team up.

330
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,831
Teach me to make the revolution.

331
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,713
Comprehensive program.
You will not be rich enough.

332
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,109
Half.

333
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,477
Half of our treasure.

334
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,670
It's pretty, right?

335
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,156
Forget the treasure and listen to me.

336
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,998
It does not exist.

337
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,750
Give me the money, the true,

338
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,714
I can see and touch.

339
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,515
That's all that interests me.

340
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,275
Say 200 per day.

341
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,438
Plus costs.
Prepaid.

342
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,830
Give everything you have.

343
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,989
<i>With the help of gringo,
the country's banks are ours.</i>

344
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,111
<i>Not true, gringo</i>

345
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,390
This is a good investment.

346
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,079
Rafael!

347
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,352
I have nothing more to invest.
I lost everything.

348
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,271
You see,

349
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,392
if you ask nicely, we can have everything.

350
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,191
Your learning began.

351
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,439
First, we never turn back
to a type that has robbed.

352
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,552
Deuzio, leave here before the army arrives.

353
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,193
Many will.

354
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,479
Started!

355
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,837
You too, Rafael.
We are an army.

356
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,791
1. CAVALRY

357
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,872
One, two, one, two...

358
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,878
Section... Stop!

359
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,153
Left... left!

360
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,114
2. Infiltrate the POST
COMMAND

361
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,876
3. BUGLE

362
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,756
4. GUN

363
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,951
5. BANK

364
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,119
Come out, you are free!

365
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,157
Saut√© the locks.

366
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,237
These boots are too tight.

367
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,229
There's not much.

368
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,399
3000 or 4000 in notes, over 2,000 gold.

369
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,758
I owe you...

370
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,273
2800 for both last week, right?

371
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,429
Exact.

372
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,679
No tickets.

373
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,910
Happy to be free?

374
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,839
Leave the police to find the bandits

375
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,235
I'm not jumping for joy.

376
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,995
- Your name?
- Colomba.

377
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,234
- We are not bandits.
- Of course.

378
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,228
You are revolutionaries, I know music.

379
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,795
My father was one.

380
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,752
He eventually hanged.

381
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,158
But he would never have recruited
a stranger.

382
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,198
<i>This is not a gringo like the others.</i>

383
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,879
This is my employee.

384
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,152
He told me what to do.

385
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,030
The money is enough for me.
This is to you, General.

386
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,634
Say your speech and draw us.

387
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,308
The food and supplies

388
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,592
held by the State belong to the people,

389
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,997
that is to say to you!

390
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,359
Those who want help the revolution closer!

391
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,313
Long live the revolution!

392
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,556
The success is mixed.

393
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,196
I want to help.
Nothing keeps me here.

394
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,838
Take all uniforms.
I have an idea.

395
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,832
Not stay planted there.

396
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,996
Do what he says.

397
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,036
Colomba, if you want to follow us, help us.

398
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,599
You are military elite of this country.

399
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,631
The rebels are exhausted.

400
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,957
We will overcome

401
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,152
and eliminating their leaders.
You smile?

402
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,510
An article in the newspaper?

403
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,669
What has he?

404
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,991
- The rebels.
- Where?

405
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,715
Here.

406
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,114
One movement

407
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,199
and you become a victim of the revolution.

408
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,236
Are you ready?

409
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,873
I am ready, Paco.

410
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,033
You can reach your regiment.

411
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,152
It's 30 km walk.

412
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,872
It is not long

413
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,150
for a soldier of the republic.

414
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,151
The bag of the barracks
we reported 26,000 pesos

415
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,510
over 10,000 of the train attack.

416
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,199
How much is that?

417
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,711
5600 dollars.
4 weeks of pay.

418
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,592
And that?

419
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,670
No, repackages it.
Go.

420
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,279
So the hero?

421
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,950
A revolutionary not ashamed of his actions.

422
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,991
A thief like you, though.

423
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,628
I am not a thief.
I liberated this city.

424
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,996
This is the salary of my army.

425
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,518
This is theft.

426
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,358
Nothing else.

427
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,791
You are going away, soldiers return,

428
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,434
they will take revenge,

429
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,949
and these people will be alone again.

430
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,834
What has he?

431
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,511
It is you, the liberator.

432
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,236
They want to cheer you.

433
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,718
- Money.
- I'm on it.

434
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,038
Welcome to our city.

435
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,232
- Paco Roman Vive!
- Fear not, thief.

436
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,671
They take you to Simon Bolivar.
Show yourself.

437
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,631
It is rich, tonight!

438
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,831
Rich and happy!

439
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,592
Rich and happy!

440
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,152
What will happen tomorrow?

441
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,599
What?

442
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,714
You have my word.

443
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,636
It is.

444
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,115
There remains.
A drink.

445
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,959
You drank all night.

446
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,236
You too think too much?

447
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,918
You'll see.

448
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,875
It is wrong to think too much.

449
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,151
Everything depends on what you think.

450
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,518
You think like me?

451
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,554
I am sure General.

452
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,670
Let's go see it together.

453
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,039
Who is it?

454
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,396
The army is coming this way.
A whole regiment.

455
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,038
We'll see tomorrow.

456
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,193
By the way...

457
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,918
It is that this Simon Bolivar?

458
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,479
And what does that mean, make a revolution?

459
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,917
Make a revolution?

460
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,551
At the head, there are leaders,

461
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,109
those who work other.

462
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,751
The rich.

463
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,353
Below,

464
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,312
there are the poor.

465
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,229
The revolution aims at unity.

466
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:36,192
Gather the top and bottom.

467
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,511
Malin, the Bolivar.

468
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,560
They are brought together
and it is the revolution?

469
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,233
It's impossible.

470
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,271
As you see,

471
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,359
rich and poor are well separated.

472
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,914
I see.

473
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,349
I'm with the poor.

474
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,593
It should be ready in 10 minutes.

475
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,756
- The machine gun is next.
- No.

476
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,631
What, no?

477
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,875
No, that's all.

478
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,272
I must stay here.

479
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,789
You're still drunk.

480
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,118
You're going to sober up quickly
when he saw the guns.

481
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,991
That's why I stay.

482
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,916
I have to protect these people.

483
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,000
These pigs Republicans not scare me.

484
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,998
I will fight with one hand.

485
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,078
Of course, general you're a big boy.

486
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,838
It is found in Sonora.

487
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,118
If you drop these pigs Republicans

488
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,709
back and deep pockets.

489
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,035
Why?

490
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,312
Next time, my rates have increased.

491
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,152
<i>Poor Paco .</i>

492
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,237
<i>You think you're Bolivar.</i>

493
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,670
<i>You became an idealist.</i>

494
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,633
<i>The shortest path to the cemetery.</i>

495
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,111
And for lunch?

496
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,553
30 eggs, 2 sliced?? ham,
4 pounds of cheese

497
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,637
40 loaves of bread at a minimum,

498
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,991
and 30 bottles of beer.
Especially beer.

499
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,317
All...
this is for you?

500
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,398
Do not ask a man that pays well.

501
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,398
Of course, everything you want.

502
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,556
I will not ask anything.

503
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,715
You are right.

504
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,030
<i>Paco is on its way.</i>

505
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,708
<i>Looking for me, that's for sure.</i>

506
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,789
<i>Hello, Se√±or.
Sleep well?</i>

507
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,632
Yes, thank you.

508
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,312
You have everything ready?

509
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,558
<i>Yes, se√±or .</i>

510
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,149
Everything is ready.

511
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,397
Hams, the loaves of bread,

512
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,628
30 bottles of beer, as expected, generally.

513
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,748
Captain.

514
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,428
Yes... Captain.

515
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,273
Get out of there.

516
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,594
Shall we?

517
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,515
Get out of there, it will cool.

518
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,076
There were too many.

519
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,637
Everything went wrong.

520
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,199
Curly was with them.

521
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,150
The guy we did not kill.

522
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,514
I know what you're thinking, the Polack.

523
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,673
I offer you twice.

524
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,513
I do not do credit.

525
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,638
Ira.

526
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,759
You're an honest man.

527
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,871
Listen, Paco, I can make you as famous

528
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,040
that Pancho Villa or Zapata.

529
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,356
I can make you all rich,

530
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,114
but I want to be left carte blanche.

531
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,792
What do you mean?

532
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,669
Do not worry, I've thought of everything.

533
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,553
I we have prepared a small contract.

534
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,996
"First,

535
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,954
"I will be the sole judge

536
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,630

"Of property confiscated

549
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,919
Sign.

550
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:24,073
If you lower your trousers
before the Poles,

551
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,959
why not add women to the list?

552
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,910
Paco Roman will provide you also women.

553
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,839
The revolution deserves that!

554
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,039
Choose the ones you want.

555
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,829
Those whores

556
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,759
or those who love the fine gentlemen.

557
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,271
Even the most expensive!

558
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,710
Even a soldier in petticoats like me.

559
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,632
You do not refuse him anything.
He need only ask.

560
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,353
Go to bed, Colomba.

561
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,590
<i>- Enough.
- In bed? Come gringo.</i>

562
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,475
Go ahead alone.

563
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,148
The Polack did not want you.

564
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,589
I said nothing.

565
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,593
Colomba, listen to me.

566
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,593
You do not want him?

567
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,394
Of course I do.
Why not?

568
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,909
<i>He, at least, this is a hombre!</i>

569
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,354
Are you happy?

570
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,394
Not quite.
Try like that.

571
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,551
With his best friend.

572
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,428
And his partner.

573
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,951
<i>Gringo!</i>

574
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,469
Where is he?

575
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,359
It stinks, right?

576
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,517
No.

577
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,119
It's good for the skin.

578
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,879
- It's true, you look great.
- What did you, idiot?

579
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,195
Go ahead.

580
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,153
Show us as good as the Mexicans.

581
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,436
Go!
Or I'll blow your brains out.

582
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,154
<i>Sorry, gringo.</i>

583
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,590
You know how women are.

584
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,109
I want it.

585
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,716
You exaggerate, Paco.

586
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,559
But if you want a fight,

587
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,275
I'll show you how a jealous idiot

588
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,357
is thrashing.

589
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,788
Standing.

590
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,637
- It's unfair!
- Wait a minute.

591
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,195
Take that in the face!

592
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,676
He's crazy!

593
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,437
You won, Paco.

594
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,715
Arm.

595
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,796
Plays.

596
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,638
Fire!

597
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,193
Halt.

598
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,310
What?

599
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,953
Why do we stop?

600
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,113
I'm hot.

601
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,875
Santa Rosita is a big city.

602
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:10,117
There will be a garrison.
It's risky.

603
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,198
I know, but it's worth it.

604
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,189
This Thursday, Rosita is holy festival.

605
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,598
The bearded lady.

606
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,198
There will be a procession

607
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,640
and you know how we are believers.

608
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:30,676
Really?

609
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:21,715
Now!

610
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,357
At first of these gentlemen.

611
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,998
I have four for the price of one.

612
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,590
Who is it?

613
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,109
Mayor with his family.

614
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:16,717
Let them hang.

615
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,471
No, wait.

616
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,639
She will cook and he shall wash our pants.

617
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,239
Outside.

618
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,189
General Paco Roman!

619
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,512
I demand justice.
Let me back my land.

620
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,518
- I want his head.
- What has he done?

621
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,551
Ask her.
It is the notary.

622
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,268
What have you done?

623
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,675
I did not do anything, listen.

624
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,552
That's the truth:

625
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,752
For three months, he asked me to share

626
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,269
my house and my wife

627
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,029
against his wife and his wretched farm

628
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,515
because it is the revolution!

629
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,588
All right.

630
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,152
Kill him.

631
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,831
Not him, the other.
One who demands justice.

632
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,037
No, General.
It is rich, I'm poor!

633
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:41,199
Thank you, General.
You are the hope of Mexico.

634
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,192
My brother!

635
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,789
Your brother?

636
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,068
I do not know you.

637
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:00,311
I worked in the mines with you, my friend!

638
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,158
My friend!

639
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,828
I worked in the mines.

640
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,110
It's me, Pepote!

641
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,515
Pepote!

642
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,795
I knew a Pepote.

643
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,070
It was a revolutionary.

644
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,157
It was like my brother.

645
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,514
I sent it to buy guns.

646
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,476
It was long ago.

647
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,709
I do not even know you.

648
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,949
Remember,

649
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,195
he was given money.

650
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,193
When he failed to return,
it was believed dead.

651
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,913
Let me explain.

652
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,674
I'm still alive.

653
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,718
There, I recognize you.

654
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,468
You recognize him?

655
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,838
Thank you, my friend.

656
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,953
You have betrayed us.

657
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,992
You have spent our money.

658
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,513
You should not have.

659
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,232
Not really.
Do not waste a bullet.

660
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,589
Take a knife.

661
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,671
No, I saved your life!

662
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:46,158
I beg you, I did not want to hurt.

663
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,515
This is because of women.

664
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,359
It's true.

665
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,278
You saved my life.

666
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,593
I will not kill you.

667
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,078
But you will not go over to a brothel.

668
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,952
I swear.

669
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:10,038
I swear I will not do it again!

670
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,072
I have to be sure.

671
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,433
He should thank me to spare.

672
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:28,153
We can not rely to anyone.

673
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,515
Paco wants to see you.

674
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,314
He wants to see that too.

675
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,593
You are leaving us?

676
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,708
It not abandon his friends to their cause.

677
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,950
Nobody ever left Paco

678
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,151
with deep pockets.

679
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,114
Your money stays here

680
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,958
to serve the revolution.

681
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,395
You're a pig.

682
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,797
Maybe, I do not know.

683
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,273
You see that?

684
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,715
This is Mexico.

685
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,954
I did not know it was so great.

686
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,312
It's beautiful.

687
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,148
I want to work for Mexico.

688
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,875
I will take what is ours.

689
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,991
I want justice.

690
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,838
You will be judged.

691
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,032
Colomba.

692
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,996
"For eating when we were starving

693
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,149
"Drunk and when we were thirsty,

694
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,950
"For staying dry

695
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:54,039
"When we walked in the rain and so on,

696
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,559
"We condemn you ..."

697
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,036
At death, I presume?

698
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,592
I do not know...

699
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,759
yet.

700
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,638
It depends my digestion.

701
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,270
We will have our wedding dinner.

702
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,512
Your fate will depend Colomba.

703
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,751
Do not be too optimistic.

704
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,235
I will marry him.

705
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,873
I am a General

706
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,354
and a revolutionary.

707
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,232
I do not need a priest,

708
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,271
or paperwork.

709
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,678
Take him.

710
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:40,595
Outside.

711
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,236
What a party!

712
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,554
Your sword...

713
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,034
Removes it.

714
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,959
It hurts me.

715
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,475
Fire!

716
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,513
What is it?

717
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,716
Firecrackers.

718
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,036
They celebrate our marriage.

719
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:01,789
Too bad...

720
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,992
- We must liberate the Poles.
- Forget it.

721
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:08,233
Paco, they attack!

722
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,989
All right, I'll release it.

723
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,596
They destroy everything.

724
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,511
The Polack they will raze the city!

725
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,434
These bastards are everywhere.

726
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,468
Help me.
They even have a plane.

727
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,591
I can hit him with a gun?

728
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,831
It's possible, yes.

729
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,277
But that's your problem.

730
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,519
We no longer team.

731
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,756
It may be wrong.

732
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,713
I will make your money with 10 000.

733
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,239
Too late!

734
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,672
No, come back!

735
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,199
Stop him!

736
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,151
Farewell, Paco!

737
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,116
Perfect, they are our thank you.

738
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,434
Bravo for once the plane.

739
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,757
I'll pick my two rascals.

740
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,111
You had promised me.

741
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,309
Forward!

742
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,437
If it is low enough...

743
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:49,795
Paco!

744
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:50,950
Colomba!

745
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:03,112
I'm stuck.
Blow up the lock.

746
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,670
Too late, they all died.

747
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:33,908
Listen to me.

748
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,280
Where are the Poles and Paco?

749
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:41,598
You can go to hell.

750
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,552
- So?
- Their band is decimated.

751
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:21,194
But Paco and Polack I have missed.

752
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,630
I have them.
Both of them.

753
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,391
I let you do as you intended.

754
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,511
I could have caught.

755
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,790
God knows where they are.

756
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,560
I want them both alive!

757
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:39,638
Double the reward and patrols.

758
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,198
As you wish.

759
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,713
<i>Paco managed to get away.</i>

760
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:50,717
<i>It went from hero to clown</i>

761
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,558
<i>in six months.</i>

762
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,239
Hello, Curly.

763
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:27,755
As we find ourselves.

764
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,040
One last time.
If you want to kill him,

765
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,073
give him a chance.

766
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,109
He can defend himself.

767
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,872
A ball each.

768
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,909
Going back to back.

769
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:10,869
At the third sounding, you can take.

770
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,390
Go.

771
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,156
Have you seen? Subject property, eh?

772
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:48,908
Not bad.

773
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,149
I knew you'd end up.

774
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,395
I want...

775
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,990
Take your filthy paws, Paco.

776
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,791
Go, ahead.

777
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,791
We're going where?

778
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,149
Mexico.

779
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,794
You're worth $ 10 000.

780
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,956
I will recover what you robbed me.

781
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,154
Bastard.

782
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:25,748
Hurry up.

783
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,793
You've never been so clean.

784
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,998
You're sure of yourself?

785
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:37,035
I want my money.

786
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:02,348
He takes her to the 51st regiment.
It will be before them!

787
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,436
MEXICAN BORDER

788
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,634
The Poles, I understand.

789
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:25,195
But Paco?

790
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,036
Are you married?

791
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,719
We were,

792
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,592
but a Mexican woman

793
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,030
can not be fooled twice.

794
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,871
And if it was a trap?

795
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,355
<i>I will stay with you, se√±or Garcia</i>

796
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,030
until your soldiers to have captured.

797
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,231
Then you pay me.

798
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,079
I see.

799
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,989
What do you sing?

800
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,518
A song of a compatriot.

801
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,073
You may know.

802
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,599
Chopin.

803
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,629
No... Expect.
There is no Chihuahua?

804
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,917
Hello, Commander.

805
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,315
I give you this rebel.

806
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,670
The famous Paco Roman.

807
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:13,790
Mexico There is now 3000 pesos.

808
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,274
In this regard,

809
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:19,712
I have something right here
might interest you.

810
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,752
It's you!

811
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:42,753
This is you!

812
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,356
Prepare a cell.

813
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:04,954
Section, halt!

814
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,513
You have earned this, with my compliments.

815
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:26,629
You and I we could be celebrating tonight.

816
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,429
Both of them.

817
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:32,833
Expect at least he died, Colonel.

818
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:36,354
Be.

819
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,631
I do not inflict it.

820
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,913
As you see,

821
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,714
you have more value your friend.

822
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,952
That's a start.

823
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,111
Pass them by arms.

824
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,278
Look where greed has led you.

825
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:33,109
I do not understand why She denounced you.

826
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:34,514
Women...

827
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:36,199
It's a revolutionary.

828
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:40,188
The revolution needs of these 60 000 pesos.

829
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,278
A guy like me, it's everywhere.

830
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:01,632
"On behalf of the republic,
I condemn the firing squad

831
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:04,912

If she hopes to save you as well,

844
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,788
it is mistaken.

845
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,831
Our salvation will come from heaven.

01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:41,837
Arm.

847
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:42,995
Colomba, aims tanks.

848
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,515
Do not move!

849
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,794
You will not forget.

850
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,468
See you in San Pedro in two days.

851
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:13,437
- Tell them that Paco returned.
- I will.

852
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:15,833
Good luck!

853
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:31,315
Well?

854
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,152
There's your share.

855
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:45,556
I leave the Polack.

856
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,792
I join my people.

857
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,711
Paco.

858
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,990
It might be good, we both.

859
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,037
Teaming.

860
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:09,152
Novel and Kowalski, associate.

861
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:13,789
There is always a revolution
start somewhere.

862
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:16,715
We can help each camp

863
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:21,148
and to retire a few years.

864
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,518
Teaming up with you,

865
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:26,959
it would be nice,

866
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,476
but my revolution is here.

867
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:33,599
Farewell, friend.

868
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,313
They'll end up.

869
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,558
Perhaps.

870
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,478
But I have a dream to pursue.

871
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,318
Thou hast no dream?

872
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:56,671
It does not surprise me.

873
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:21,475
Now.

874
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,393
Good luck, Paco!

875
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:02,354
Continues to dream but keep your eyes open.
