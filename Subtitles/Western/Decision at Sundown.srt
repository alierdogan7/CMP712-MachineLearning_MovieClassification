1
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,403
Driver!

2
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,005
Pull up here.

3
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,374
I said, pull up.

4
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,021
You, shotgun, stand up!

5
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,121
Throw me my rifle.

6
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:40,326
All right, boys, you can move out.

7
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,629
From now on,
we're going in different directions.

8
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,729
Well, git!

9
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:14,127
Morning, Bart. I was beginning to think
that coach was never gonna get here.

10
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:18,965
Looks like it woke you up.
- Well, waiting makes a man sleepy.

11
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,934
I've been over in that hollow
since yesterday afternoon.

12
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:26,339
Kind of scared the coach
might pass me during the night.

13
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,609
The way he's traveling now, though,
he'd have been by here two days ago.

14
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,344
I'd have missed you altogether.

15
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,817
Rough as you look, though,
I can't say as I blame him.

16
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,078
Sam, you sure it's him?

17
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,356
Well, of course I'm sure.
There ain't a hundred Tate Kimbroughs.

18
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,591
There could be,
but I'm only interested in one.

19
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:48,728
Well, wait till you see him for yourself.
You'll know that's the one.

20
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,230
He's a big man in Sundown?
- The biggest.

21
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,767
He's got that town in his fist
and he's squeezing it hard.

22
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:58,504
Ain't heard the folks complain much.
Guess they're all scared.

23
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:00,740
Glad to hear he's doing so well.

24
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,475
When a man's riding high,
the ground comes up

25
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,143
and hits him a lot harder when he falls.

26
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,346
Well, why don't you rest a little while?

27
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,281
You know I ain't had nothing to eat
since yesterday.

28
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,816
We could make a little fire and cook up...

29
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,231
We'll be eating when we get to Sundown.

30
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,613
Today's not Sunday.
- Thursday.

31
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:41,948
What's all the commotion?

32
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:46,919
Tate Kimbrough's getting married.
- Today? Why didn't you tell me?

33
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:49,555
Well, I didn't reckon it was important.

34
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:53,526
Sam, folks say the most important moment
in a man's life is when he gets married.

35
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,528
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

36
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,231
There's a pretty good eating house down...
- Where's the barbershop?

37
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,565
Over there.

38
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:02,969
I'm not going to miss the most important
moment in Tate Kimbrough's life.

39
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,706
A man shouldn't go to a wedding
with stubble on his face.

40
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,442
A man shouldn't go to a wedding
on an empty belly neither.

41
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,576
Go ahead and fill it.

42
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:14,586
No reason for you to go,
stomach empty or full.

43
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,452
You'll have to come back
this afternoon, mister.

44
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:23,022
This is my last customer. I'm closing up.
I'll be open again at 2:00.

45
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:26,726
What time's the big wedding today?
- In about half an hour.

46
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,327
Ain't you almost finished with him?

47
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:31,664
Shouldn't take you more than 15 minutes
to shave my whiskers.

48
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,739
I told you, mister, I'm closing up.

49
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,973
You wouldn't be going to a wedding
looking like this, would you, Mr. Barber?

50
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:43,276
No, but...
- That's what I mean.

51
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:47,747
I told you, I'm closing up.
- You told him three times.

52
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,149
You don't mind if I shave myself?

53
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:54,520
Well, no. No, sir, I don't mind, not at all.
- Thanks.

54
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,620
Go ahead.

55
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,227
I take it you're good friends
of Mr. Kimbrough.

56
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,795
Do you?

57
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:06,532
Well, it looks like you've come a long way
to attend his wedding.

58
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,632
We've come a long way.

59
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,937
Mr. Kimbrough is a very lucky man.

60
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,239
He's marrying up
with Miss Lucy Summerton,

61
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,375
the finest and prettiest
young lady in Sundown.

62
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:18,344
Sounds like you think might highly of her.

63
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,112
Oh, yes, I certainly do.

64
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:21,948
Lady like that's making a big mistake

65
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,618
marrying a man
as rotten as Tate Kimbrough.

66
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:30,523
I guess you've figured out now
we ain't friends of Mr. Kimbrough's.

67
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:34,703
You shouldn't talk like that
about Mr. Kimbrough.

68
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,654
Thank you, Mr. Summerton.

69
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,254
Oh, Bart, Mr. Summerton here
is Lucy's papa.

70
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,103
Yeah?

71
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,606
That's a shame.

72
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,509
Good morning, Mr. Summerton.

73
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:16,102
Good morning, Doctor.
- How is Lucy feeling today?

74
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,906
Both the Summertons are enjoying
excellent health, I am happy to say.

75
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,842
Well, I wasn't inquiring about her health.

76
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:27,277
Being a physician,
that should be your only concern.

77
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,996
Honey!

78
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,096
Ruby!

79
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,937
I was just watching Mr. Summerton ride
down the street in his fine buggy.

80
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:55,542
Of course, you made sure that he saw you.
- He saw me.

81
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:59,111
I imagine he must be
a little upset having that

82
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:02,281
Bible-quoting justice of the peace
perform the ceremony,

83
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,650
instead of the Reverend Peterson.

84
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:11,040
It could just be that the reverend is
out of town on account of you and me.

85
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:22,271
Oh, Tate, you're making a mistake.
You'll still need me.

86
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,129
I never needed anybody.

87
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,773
Everybody's got to need somebody.

88
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:34,246
You must think you need Lucy Summerton.
- I'm marrying Lucy because I love her.

89
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:36,346
You love me.

90
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,611
But you never married me.

91
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,656
Oh, it's different between you and me.
You know that.

92
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,756
Yes, I guess I know.

93
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:50,563
It would be embarrassing for Lucy
if you stayed in town.

94
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,043
I'm leaving Sundown tonight.

95
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,602
I wouldn't want to embarrass
Mrs. Kimbrough.

96
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,422
Honey, you really are something.

97
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,511
I have to change for the wedding.

98
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,147
You can't go to the wedding.

99
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,217
Now, listen to me, Tate.
I never crowded you.

100
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,953
You know I always thought
that someday you'd marry me.

101
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,990
I've given you more
than any woman should ever give a man.

102
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,128
Even though things haven't worked out
the way they should, I've got to be there.

103
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,397
To remind Lucy and her father
and everybody else in town about us?

104
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,098
That's not the reason.
I've got to be there for me, Tate.

105
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,663
Don't you understand? For me.

106
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,039
Maybe if I see you getting married,

107
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:38,878
it'll be easier for me to understand
that now you belong to somebody else.

108
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,978
Ruby,

109
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,150
do me one last favor, will you?

110
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,380
Don't sit in the front pew.

111
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,111
That sure is a good eating house
down there on the corner.

112
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,747
These horses need food more than we do.
Where's the stable?

113
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,142
Right down there a stretch.

114
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:36,736
Hey, Doc, come in here
and give me a hand, will you?

115
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,836
Yeah, sure.

116
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,845
We want to buy some feed
for our horses, mister.

117
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:50,280
You'll have to talk to Abe about that.
He's in here.

118
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,057
I ain't wore these boots in five years.
My feet must have growed some.

119
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,352
Push.
- Oh, who are you?

120
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,061
We want to buy some feed for our horses.

121
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,220
How many you got?
- Two.

122
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:09,797
Much obliged, Doc.
Give me 50 cents and help yourself.

123
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,743
I can't go to church smelling like a horse.

124
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,147
Try some of it. It's real sweet-smelling stuff.

125
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,248
Yeah.

126
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,317
You figure on staying in Sundown
for any length of time?

127
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,219
We could.

128
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:32,024
You know, there's a lot of folks around here
that ain't interested in seeing you rebels.

129
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,325
The war is over.

130
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:37,329
I bet you still got plenty folks down in
Texas that thinks the war is still going on.

131
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:39,098
What makes you think we're from Texas?

132
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,400
From your talk,
I sure didn't think you was Yankees.

133
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,769
Yeah.
- What brings you two fellas to Sundown?

134
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,973
Tate Kimbrough.
- Oh, mighty fine fellow, Mr. Kimbrough.

135
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:50,242
Sure nice you got here
in time for his wedding.

136
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,479
Well, come on, Doc,
we'll walk over to the church together.

137
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,613
I'm not going.

138
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:58,150
Oh, sometimes you take things too serious.

139
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,650
I don't think so.
- Well, it's up to you.

140
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,715
Something bothering you, mister?

141
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,968
Were you afraid that Mr. Kimbrough
wouldn't like it

142
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,383
if you weren't in time for his wedding?

143
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,919
Some folks around here figure
that Sundown doesn't need

144
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,164
any more of Tate Kimbrough's friends.

145
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:46,639
We ain't interested in what some folks
around here figure.

146
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,374
Sheriff, I was shaving Mr. Summerton
when those two men came into my shop.

147
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,243
One was a fellow I saw hanging around
town a couple of days ago,

148
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,878
the other one I never saw before.

149
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,013
Well, what about them?

150
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,716
Well, I don't like their looks,
especially the one I never saw before.

151
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,185
The nerve of him,
talking about Tate Kimbrough like he did.

152
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,554
I tell you, Sheriff, he's a bad one.

153
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:45,791
Well, what are you going to do?
- Nothing he can do.

154
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,059
He ain't broke any laws.

155
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,129
But he said that Tate Kimbrough...
- The stranger just stated an opinion.

156
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:55,924
Now, you can't arrest a man
for having an opinion, can you, Sheriff?

157
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:02,589
Good morning, gentlemen.
What'll you have?

158
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,546
You got anything to eat?

159
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,416
The restaurant's right down the street,
but it's closed.

160
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,384
Two whiskeys, then.

161
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:17,690
Your money's no good today, mister.
All the drinks are on Tate Kimbrough.

162
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,026
We're paying for our drinks.
- There's no charge.

163
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,527
If you don't mind, we'd like to pay.

164
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:28,514
Give him back his money, Otis.

165
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:42,403
That sign means what it says, mister.
- So do I, Sheriff.

166
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:53,113
Otis, make sure everybody's got a full glass.

167
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,747
The good health
of Mr. And Mrs. Tate Kimbrough.

168
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,185
Sheriff, I'd sure appreciate it
if you'd get my money out of there,

169
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,600
wipe it off and put it back on the bar.

170
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,192
Better hurry, Sheriff.

171
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:05,562
I don't think Mr. Kimbrough
would like you to miss his wedding.

172
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:10,778
Mister, if you're figuring
to stay on in Sundown,

173
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,216
you're making a big mistake.

174
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:27,619
Otis, the sheriff left you a messy job,

175
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,988
but my friend and I would like
these drinks before we leave.

176
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:31,457
That's all right, you go right ahead.

177
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,597
You paid for your drink.

178
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,754
Otis, I think I will have that drink.

179
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,370
On me.

180
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:37,050
Doc!
- Hello, Ruby.

181
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,893
Do me a favor. Ride with me to the church.

182
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:46,064
Well, I wasn't planning on going.
- Please.

183
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,301
All right, Ruby.

184
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:33,789
I sure never expected Morley Chase
and the C-Cross boys at the wedding.

185
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,123
Something wrong, Barber?

186
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:43,789
Oh, no, no, no, Mr. Chase. It's just that...

187
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:44,890
Just that what?

188
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,593
Well, none of us figured on seeing you here,

189
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,229
on account of you and Tate
ain't exactly friends.

190
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,031
Well, why not?
I'm no different than the rest of you boys.

191
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:56,956
You know we all feel
the same about the groom.

192
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,287
The day's full of surprises.

193
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:10,189
What's she doing with him?

194
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:41,980
Make way for Mr. Kimbrough.

195
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,480
Come on, now,
make way for Mr. Kimbrough.

196
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:51,242
All right, everybody, stand aside
and make way for the bridegroom.

197
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:03,035
Good morning, Mr. Kimbrough.
- Good morning, Zeke.

198
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,604
All right, folks, everybody inside.

199
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,934
Men, leave your guns in the vestibule.

200
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,656
Good morning. Good morning.

201
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,942
I ain't never been to no wedding,
even yours.

202
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,167
You stay here.
- Oh, Bart!

203
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:29,048
Dear brethren,
we are gathered together on this...

204
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:35,119
Sheriff, we shouldn't proceed with
the ceremony with you toting a gun.

205
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,168
Your gun.
- Thank you.

206
00:21:49,774 --> 00:21:53,345
Dear brethren, we're gathered here
together on this glorious day

207
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:58,545
to unite Lucy Summerton
and Tate Kimbrough in holy matrimony.

208
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:04,456
Oh, friends, before I begin the ceremony,
there's a question here that has to be asked.

209
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,725
Is there any man here
who knows any reason

210
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,728
why these two dear people
should not be married?

211
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,431
If so, let him speak
or forever hold his peace.

212
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,931
Lucy Summerton, do you take...
- Hold it!

213
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,203
Well, now, look here, everybody's welcome,

214
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,172
as long as they leave
their gun in the vestibule

215
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,474
and ain't got enough whiskey in them
to make them troublesome.

216
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,010
You said if anybody had any objection
to this wedding to speak up.

217
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,203
That's what I'm doing.

218
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,513
We're not interested, stranger.

219
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,849
Kimbrough, we never laid eyes
on each other before today,

220
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,989
and we're not strangers.

221
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:37,113
Think back to Sabine Pass
and a girl named Mary.

222
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,993
I never heard of Sabine Pass.
- Lying ain't gonna help you none.

223
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:46,965
Swede, get that man out of here
so we can go on with our wedding.

224
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,065
Stay where you are.

225
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:55,440
You'd better leave town
if you want to stay in one piece.

226
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,909
I'll leave when I finish what I came for.

227
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,911
Well, whoever you are,
and whatever you came for,

228
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,580
you're not going to stop this wedding.

229
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,849
The name's Allison, Miss. Bart Allison.

230
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:08,284
If you marry this man,
you'll be a widow by sundown.

231
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,359
You, take this money down to the preacher.

232
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,135
Good gracious, what's this for?

233
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:25,770
Maybe I just done you out of a wedding fee,

234
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:31,820
so you can keep that money for
performing Kimbrough's funeral services.

235
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,064
You men sit down and stay quiet.

236
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,229
Wagon!

237
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,849
Around the corner.

238
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:06,938
You should have killed that fellow
when he passed us on the street,

239
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,006
instead of there in church.

240
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,741
I didn't kill him.

241
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,343
Then what is all the fuss about?

242
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,078
I just told him I was going to.

243
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,321
You just stood up there in church

244
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,924
and told Kimbrough
you was going to kill him.

245
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:30,061
Bart, you must be plumb crazy.
- I'm doing this my own way, Sam.

246
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,631
For three years I've hunted Kimbrough,
but he didn't know it.

247
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:38,001
Before I settle with him,
I want him to know he's being hunted.

248
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:46,102
You ain't hunting him no more,
he's hunting you.

249
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:58,289
They're holed up in Abe's livery stable.

250
00:25:58,389 --> 00:25:59,958
Now, don't worry, Tate,
they ain't going nowhere.

251
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,894
We got that whole stable covered,
front and back.

252
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,096
Seeing as how I'm your best man
and got the ring,

253
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,432
I figured I ought to get back
so's we could get on with the wedding.

254
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,600
You done the right thing, Sheriff.

255
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,037
Now, if everybody will get back inside,
we'll proceed with the ceremony.

256
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,622
You can't have a wedding without a bride.

257
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,274
Lucy!

258
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,288
Charlie, I expect you to have Lucy
back here at the church by 12:00.

259
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,790
I don't think we ought to go ahead
with this wedding

260
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,625
until this man Allison is behind bars.

261
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,160
Don't worry about him.

262
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,829
I should think you'd be worried about him.
He said he was going to kill you.

263
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,898
He's not going to kill me.

264
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,434
Allison's not the first man
that's had that thought in mind.

265
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:46,671
It's more than just a thought with that one.
- I told you not to worry about him, Charlie.

266
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,576
I expect Lucy back here by 12:00.

267
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,014
I want you to get him now.

268
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,283
Tate, he won't come out,
and we can't get in there and get him

269
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,051
without somebody getting shot up.

270
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,087
I pay you and the boys real good, Swede.

271
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,254
If I didn't think a little gunplay

272
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:04,989
would come up from time to time,
you wouldn't be worth it.

273
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:06,991
He won't stay holed up forever.
As soon as he makes his move...

274
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:08,860
You haven't got forever.

275
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,195
I don't care how you do it.

276
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,031
You've got exactly one hour
to take care of Mr. Allison.

277
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:17,502
I'll be at the hotel.
- I wouldn't pass by the stable on the way.

278
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,105
You're liable to not get there.

279
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:23,010
Tate, is there anything I can do?

280
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,177
How long has it been
since you've handled a gun?

281
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,813
Gracious. Not since the fracas up in Denver.

282
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,404
I don't like guns much.

283
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,750
That figures.

284
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:45,432
Well, Ruby, it looks like the wedding's
been called off, for a while anyway.

285
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,976
That fellow sure was a nervy cuss,
wasn't he, Doc?

286
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,780
Yeah. It's too bad he didn't use a little
common sense along with his nerve.

287
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,448
What do you mean?

288
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:09,583
Well, now he hasn't got a chance of
accomplishing what he came here for.

289
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:18,290
Herb, you and Pete get up
above that eating house.

290
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:19,831
Unless one of them shows his face,

291
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:21,766
you just keep shooting
at the window nearest Spanish

292
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,891
when he makes his move.

293
00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:55,867
Allison, unless you and your partner
want to die in that stable,

294
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,802
you'll throw out your guns and come on out.

295
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,270
I ain't ready yet.

296
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,674
When I am, I'll be coming out
the same time my gun does.

297
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:06,175
If you don't come out, we're coming in.

298
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,559
You sure would be making a big mistake.

299
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:38,807
There ain't no way they can get at us
from the rear.

300
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,355
Bart!

301
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:35,452
That fellow seemed awful anxious
to come in here, so bring him in.

302
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,107
Where you going, Doc?

303
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:47,712
I left my satchel in here.
I figure I'm gonna need it.

304
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,449
Come on in.

305
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,354
Fix him up.

306
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,963
A lot of people hoped
this would be more serious, Spanish.

307
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,164
Including you, Doc?

308
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,199
When a man takes a hand in something
that's no concern of his,

309
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,699
he ain't usually so lucky.

310
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,768
Take your hand away.

311
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,871
Here, bite.

312
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,815
Stand up, Spanish.

313
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,990
Ain't it lucky you brought the iodine, Doc?

314
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,278
Now, you just go on about your business,
and tell everybody else to do the same.

315
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:57,948
This here thing's
between Kimbrough and me.

316
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,487
You had your chance to kill Tate.

317
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,157
You won't live long enough to get another.

318
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,591
Come on, Spanish.

319
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,098
You'd better move along, too, now, Doc.

320
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,167
Spanish is right, Allison.

321
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,370
It's a pity,
but when a man is bent on revenge,

322
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,938
he has a one-track mind.

323
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:23,975
He seldom accomplishes
what he sets out to do.

324
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:28,079
You sound like you wouldn't mind
seeing Kimbrough killed yourself, Doc.

325
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,914
No, I guess I wouldn't.

326
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,716
I don't believe in violence,

327
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:35,453
but maybe that's the only way Sundown
can get rid of Tate Kimbrough.

328
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:39,957
What did he do to you?
- Never did anything to me, personally.

329
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:43,528
After the war,
I came out west to set up practice.

330
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,431
I fell in love with Sundown
the first time I saw it.

331
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,967
After I got to know the people,
I fell in love with them, too.

332
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:52,270
When Kimbrough came to town
a couple of years ago,

333
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,005
things changed, people changed.

334
00:32:56,207 --> 00:33:02,713
I don't imagine I have to tell you how it
feels to see something you love destroyed.

335
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:05,618
Who's Mary?
- She was Bart's wife.

336
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,809
You got what you came in here for. Now git.

337
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:31,442
Bart, when you told me to check Sundown
for a fella named Tate Kimbrough,

338
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:35,513
you didn't tell me you was aiming
to kill him because of Mary.

339
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,613
Now you know.

340
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,083
Yeah.

341
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:04,442
I'm sorry I drove off and left you, Dad.
- I know you were terribly upset.

342
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:09,113
First that woman has the colossal gall
to show up at my wedding.

343
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,283
And then that beast of a man
interrupts the whole thing

344
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,819
and tells me that I'll be a widow
before the day's over.

345
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,855
I was there, dear, I know what happened.

346
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,458
And do you know
what happened in Sabine Pass?

347
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,638
And about a woman named Mary?
- You know I don't.

348
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:28,232
Well, I haven't heard any shooting
for a few minutes.

349
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,967
Maybe that means they've gotten him.

350
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,802
No, he's holed up in the livery stable.

351
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:34,906
He won't come out
and nobody'll go in and get him.

352
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:38,776
Darling, Tate expects you to be
at the church at noon.

353
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:39,944
Will I tell him you'll be there?

354
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:43,648
Now, now, in spite of everything
that's happened,

355
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:49,358
I see no real reason why you shouldn't
go through with the wedding.

356
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,714
Lucy, I have to tell Tate something.

357
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:59,981
Well, when I've made up my mind
what I'm going to do, I'll tell him myself.

358
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,710
One shot at those Texans every half-hour
ain't getting us no place.

359
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:47,828
I bet Tate's really fuming
having his wedding held up like this.

360
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,381
Now you get this straight.

361
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,050
I pay you a notch higher than the rest,
so I expect more from you.

362
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,552
You pay for my services, Tate,

363
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,220
but you haven't got enough money
to buy my life.

364
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,990
A man can't storm that stable
without getting himself killed.

365
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,090
Spanish is still alive.

366
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,654
How about it, Spanish?
You willing to try again?

367
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:09,600
Not alone, but I'll try it again
if you'll side me, Swede.

368
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,869
Well, what about it, Swede?

369
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,238
Well, Spanish has never been too bright.

370
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,408
Maybe he doesn't mind
getting a belly full of lead, but I do.

371
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,744
Maybe he isn't too bright,
but it don't look like

372
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,579
he scares as easy as you do.
- I'm not scared, Tate.

373
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,314
I'm just using good sense.

374
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:27,239
He's right, Tate. All you have to do is wait.

375
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:28,886
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

376
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,155
Well, I'm not going to wait.

377
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:34,959
So, Swede, stop telling me
how much sense you got

378
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,461
and start living up to that reputation
you've been bragging about.

379
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:39,163
Now, go on down there
and blast them out of that hole

380
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,198
and stop acting like a scared kid.

381
00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:45,123
You know that last part
could go for you, too.

382
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,071
Maybe you're not scared enough
of the right people.

383
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,639
Well, if you're in such a hurry
to take care of them,

384
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,224
why don't you go tackle the job yourself?

385
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,343
Come in!

386
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,712
Tate, I don't...

387
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:00,384
You don't what, Charlie?
- Well, I...

388
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,484
Yes, Charlie?

389
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,356
I doubt very much if Lucy
will go through with the wedding.

390
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:06,924
That is, at least until this man Allison is...

391
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:09,293
There's no reason for Lucy
to concern herself about Allison.

392
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,661
But I think there is.

393
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,698
This 'widow by sundown' thing
is hardly a happy thought

394
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:17,134
for a girl to have on her mind
when she's taking her marriage vows.

395
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:19,566
No, I don't suppose it is.

396
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:22,273
I don't think Allison can be feeling
quite as sure of himself

397
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,408
as he did when he sounded off
at the church.

398
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:28,546
He must realize he'll never
get out of that stable alive.

399
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,348
Now, if I was in his spot,

400
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,117
I'd jump at a chance
of riding out of this town in one piece.

401
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:36,020
Wouldn't you, Charlie?
- I certainly would.

402
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,756
So you go on down
and give him that chance.

403
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,983
Me? Why me?

404
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,828
I don't want the rest of the town to think
that I'm willing to let him go

405
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,664
after that threat he made this morning.

406
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:51,502
Of course, Charlie, I couldn't go in
the stable and tell him myself.

407
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,770
I think you can understand that.

408
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,440
Well, of course, but how about Swede here?

409
00:37:56,507 --> 00:38:00,010
Swede, go down and tell the boys
to hold that fire in case Allison agrees

410
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,830
to accept Mr. Summerton's offer.

411
00:38:03,647 --> 00:38:07,557
Are you willing just to let him
ride out, Tate?

412
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:10,752
Sure.

413
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,041
What's worrying you, Charlie?
- Well, I...

414
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:33,411
Well, this puts me in an awkward position.

415
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,845
Well, what about me?

416
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:38,649
A thing like this can start barreling,
start people talking.

417
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,685
Once Allison is out of the way
and Lucy and I are married,

418
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:47,124
the talking will taper down
and things will drop right back into normal.

419
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,360
We wouldn't want anything to change,
would we, Charlie?

420
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,690
No, no, I guess not.

421
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:56,400
You and I have always understood
one another, haven't we, Charlie?

422
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,870
Well, at least I've always understood you.

423
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,970
I'll speak to him.

424
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,324
Well, I'll be.

425
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:27,649
Next to Kimbrough, that's about the last
fella I'd figure on coming to pay us a visit.

426
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,774
Allison!

427
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:44,482
Mr. Allison, I'd like to speak to you.

428
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,582
Then start!

429
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,321
I'd rather come inside.

430
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:56,063
I can hear you just fine from where you are.

431
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:01,332
You must realize
you men are trapped in there,

432
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,901
unless you forget that foolish threat
you made at the church.

433
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,537
I ain't going to.
- Then you're a complete fool.

434
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,739
That ain't no way to talk to a man
who saved your daughter

435
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,304
from making an awful mistake.

436
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:17,047
I came down here to offer you a chance
to ride out of Sundown.

437
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:19,283
The sheriff is willing to let you leave town.

438
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,619
You mean Kimbrough's willing, don't you?

439
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,187
I can't much blame him.

440
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,856
You go on back and tell Kimbrough
we're staying.

441
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:30,060
Be reasonable, man.
Save your life and ride out of town.

442
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,429
You'll be better off than when you rode in.

443
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:33,931
How would we?

444
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,367
To be very blunt,
I'll make it worth your while.

445
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,467
How much?

446
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,204
Five hundred dollars.

447
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:46,644
That ain't very much money
for three years' work.

448
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:50,414
We've got a lot of traveling expenses
tied up in Kimbrough.

449
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:54,685
Hey, Bart, how do you like this father
offering money to save Kimbrough's skin,

450
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,288
so his daughter can marry up with him?

451
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:00,591
And Lucy always looked like
a pretty good-looking girl to me

452
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:03,928
to have her father going around
trying to buy her a husband.

453
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,130
I'm not trying
to buy my daughter a husband.

454
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,055
I don't know
what else you call it, Summerton.

455
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,121
Charlie!

456
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:01,251
Bart, I think you've done a fool thing.

457
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:02,753
After all that searching around,

458
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:06,590
it seems like you'd have been satisfied
to just kill him on sight.

459
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,793
Even a rattler gives a warning.
- Oh, yeah?

460
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:12,529
Well, if they gave as much advance notice
as you're giving that Kimbrough,

461
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:17,219
rattlesnakes would be as out of date
as them dinosaurs.

462
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,572
What time do you figure it to be?

463
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:25,409
Sun's throwing a pretty good shadow now.
It must be nigh unto 2:00.

464
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:30,003
Oh, my old belly's growling
like a trapped bear.

465
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:35,853
Bart, I think you ought to have
snapped up Summerton's offer.

466
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,990
There ain't nothing to stop you
from taking him up on it, Sam.

467
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:46,563
Oh, well, we'll probably both be as dead
as a pulled beef by suppertime, anyway.

468
00:42:46,663 --> 00:42:49,166
I sure ain't hankering to try
and argue my way

469
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,669
past old St. Peter on an empty stomach.

470
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:57,571
Allison, the offer still stands,
but it ain't going to much longer.

471
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:03,500
If you're smart, you'll ride out of town
while you got the chance.

472
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,119
Swede!

473
00:43:18,428 --> 00:43:21,532
Hey, give me another drink, will you, Otis?

474
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:22,900
Me, too.

475
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,469
Oh, I wish those fellows would hurry up
and get out of there

476
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:28,939
so I could get in and get my other boots.
These things are killing me.

477
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,476
Hey, Doc, come get these things off of me,
will you?

478
00:43:34,711 --> 00:43:38,961
Yeah, and you can send him
a bill for it, too, Doc.

479
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:53,259
That Swede is the shyest sheriff I ever saw.

480
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,266
Look at him, he's been doing nothing
but just stand there.

481
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:59,536
There's nothing keeping you from going
down there, Barber. You're not tied down.

482
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:01,705
It isn't any of my business.

483
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,141
Besides, I wouldn't want to do that, Tate.

484
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:10,361
If I went down and took care of those two,
I'd be showing up our sheriff.

485
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,551
Swede!

486
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:19,957
You still got your prayer book on you?

487
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,193
Sure do, Mr. Kimbrough.
I'm never without it.

488
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:28,903
Well, a saloon is no place for
a staunch citizen like you. Come on!

489
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,976
There something eating you, Doc?

490
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:44,941
No, nothing's bothering me, Morley.
This affair is no concern of mine.

491
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,925
After all that's happened,
Lucy needs time to think it over.

492
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,594
We've wasted too much time already.

493
00:44:57,694 --> 00:45:00,164
The train pulls out of Silver Springs
tonight at 8:00.

494
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:02,032
Mr. And Mrs. Tate Kimbrough
are going to be on it.

495
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,401
I wouldn't count on that if I were you.

496
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,737
But I am counting on it, Charlie.

497
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,238
The only changes we're making in our plans

498
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:12,163
is getting married here
instead of the church.

499
00:45:21,184 --> 00:45:24,584
Now, honey, hasn't this gone far enough?

500
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:26,456
When we decided to get married,

501
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:30,661
I didn't think it would be necessary for me
to chase after you anymore.

502
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:35,098
And come to think of it, Lucy,
it wasn't me did the chasing.

503
00:45:35,198 --> 00:45:38,302
You don't have to remind me of that, Tate.

504
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,104
I'm really no different than Ruby, am I?

505
00:45:41,204 --> 00:45:44,308
You must be.
I never asked Ruby to marry me.

506
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,408
And what about Mary?

507
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,774
I never asked her either.

508
00:45:49,846 --> 00:45:52,049
You know, there are some girls
a man gets to know pretty well

509
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:54,117
without having to ask them anything.

510
00:45:54,217 --> 00:45:55,919
How well did you get to know Mary?

511
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,822
Oh, well enough
never to consider marrying her.

512
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,358
Lucy, I never pretended to be a saint,

513
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,529
and you never tried to pass yourself off
as a wide-eyed innocent.

514
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,434
You know about Ruby and me and...

515
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:14,126
Tate, why does this man want to kill you?

516
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:17,474
Maybe it's because he doesn't
understand women the way that I do.

517
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:19,910
Lucy, I promise you,
when you wake up tomorrow morning,

518
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,445
you won't be a widow.

519
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,314
You'll be a very happy
and content Mrs. Tate Kimbrough.

520
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:28,664
Now, forget all about this fellow.
- I can't, Tate.

521
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,974
Afternoon, Lucy.
- May I come in?

522
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,275
Your Pa send you here?

523
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,682
Why should my father ask me to come here?

524
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:02,586
Well, he might have figured you'd have
a little better luck than he did.

525
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:06,086
What are you talking about?
- Come on in.

526
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:14,094
Your Pa offered to pay us to leave town.

527
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:17,184
I don't believe you.
- It's true.

528
00:47:18,668 --> 00:47:22,940
Maybe your father's more interested in
having this wedding come off than you are.

529
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,475
Look, I'm marrying Tate Kimbrough
because I want to,

530
00:47:25,575 --> 00:47:27,778
not because my father
or anyone else wants me to.

531
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,746
You're a stubborn gal.

532
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:32,582
I was hoping you'd stopped by to thank me.

533
00:47:32,682 --> 00:47:34,718
Thank you for embarrassing me
in front of the whole town?

534
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:38,355
I did you a favor, Lucy, and it won't
take long to get over your embarrassment.

535
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:41,191
And how long do you think it'll take you
to get over the fact that Tate

536
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,726
once took a woman away from you?

537
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:45,028
I'd expect Kimbrough
to explain it to you that way.

538
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,397
Well, what other way is there to explain it?

539
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:50,367
Instead of putting all the blame on Tate,
why aren't you big enough to admit

540
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,902
that whatever happened was just as much,

541
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,438
and probably more,
your fault than anyone else's?

542
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,974
Just because your girl
liked the way Tate looked

543
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:58,342
doesn't give you the right to kill him.

544
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:04,222
I don't suppose he bothered to tell you
that that 'girl' was my wife.

545
00:48:06,716 --> 00:48:11,119
Well, does even that
give you the right to kill him?

546
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:14,591
Listen, when you're in love
the way you must have been,

547
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:17,394
the truth isn't an easy thing to face up to.

548
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:20,564
No man, including Tate Kimbrough,
can take another man's wife away from him

549
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:22,199
unless she wants to be taken.

550
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:27,824
So maybe you didn't lose anything
that was really very worthwhile.

551
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:48,256
Bart, I was just thinking...

552
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,423
Well?
- That little girl had a point.

553
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:57,034
Did I hear you right?

554
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:01,471
If I'd known you was hunting Kimbrough
because of Mary,

555
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:05,311
I'd have tried to stop you from coming here.

556
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:09,544
Bart, I gotta tell you something about Mary.

557
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,685
She wasn't the girl you thought she was,

558
00:49:15,785 --> 00:49:19,610
and Tate Kimbrough,
he wasn't the first man...

559
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:27,563
Sheriff, that offer of yours still go?

560
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,667
It's about time
you started showing some sense.

561
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:33,403
Does it or don't it still go?
- It does.

562
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:36,840
Then my partner's coming out.
- I'm staying.

563
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,510
Get your horse, Sam, and get moving.
- I ain't leaving, Bart.

564
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,805
I told you to get moving.

565
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:52,255
I won't need my horse just to go
across the street to get something to eat.

566
00:49:52,355 --> 00:49:56,860
I'm going to that restaurant
and then I'm coming back.

567
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:20,014
Hold it!

568
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,417
Drop your gun belt.

569
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,975
Anybody home here?

570
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:48,977
Pancho, Jose,

571
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:52,708
Guadalupe, Maria!

572
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,086
Maureen.

573
00:51:00,423 --> 00:51:02,423
Maureen.

574
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,900
I was gonna have some enchiladas, but
maybe I'd better make it Irish stew, huh?

575
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,102
Well, you can have anything you want.

576
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:15,602
Well, bring me eggs, then. Lots of them.

577
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,240
Maureen.

578
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:24,114
I think you made a mistake
trusting the sheriff, Sam.

579
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,850
Oh, I've made a lot of mistakes
in my time, Doc.

580
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,585
One more ain't gonna hurt much.

581
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,605
What happened between you
and your friend?

582
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:38,562
I got this from trying to tell him the truth.

583
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,964
Sometimes the truth can be mighty painful.

584
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:44,401
Yeah, anyway,
maybe you can't convince a man like him

585
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:48,581
about something
he just don't want to know about.

586
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,705
You knew Mary?

587
00:51:55,312 --> 00:52:00,242
Here, this ought to hold you for a while.
- Oh, fine, fine.

588
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:06,623
I don't know whether to gulp it right down
or just let it sit there and admire it.

589
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:10,427
Well, I always figured I could go for a man
as uncertain as him.

590
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,362
Looks like it's been a long time between.

591
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,672
You want some more coffee?

592
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:27,171
You did know Mary.
- I knew her.

593
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:31,671
Maybe I should say I knew more about her.

594
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:35,585
Well, she was no wife for Bart Allison, Doc,
or no other man.

595
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:40,445
Beautiful, though,
beautiful as the springtime, but wild.

596
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,463
The way I figure it,
Kimbrough must have been

597
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:49,633
one of the last fellows
she got a hankering for.

598
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:54,271
Anyway, about a week before Bart got back
from fighting the war,

599
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,371
she killed herself.

600
00:52:57,907 --> 00:53:02,412
On account of the way she was,
I guess that's all she could do.

601
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,882
So now Allison's taking out
all of his hate on one man?

602
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:09,722
He don't figure there was ever anybody else.

603
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:12,722
Doc, I'm going back over there
and tell Bart about this whole mess

604
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:15,725
if I have to hit him over the head
and tie him up.

605
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,994
There ain't no more men like Bart Allison.

606
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:21,264
I ain't gonna let them kill him
over the likes of Mary.

607
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,732
I don't think they're gonna
let you back in there.

608
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:25,669
Sure they will. We'll get on our horses
and we'll ride out of this town

609
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:29,105
and maybe he can start living
like a man's supposed to.

610
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,741
What man knows
how a life should really be lived?

611
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,276
Well, he'll know.

612
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:39,482
He'll know as soon as he gets the memory
of that woman out of his craw. He'll know.

613
00:53:39,582 --> 00:53:42,118
The food's on me, Sam.
- Thanks, Doc.

614
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:47,573
You keep that coffee hot, honey.
I'll be back one of these days.

615
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:00,034
Texas!

616
00:54:00,336 --> 00:54:01,705
Where are you heading?

617
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:04,865
I ain't about to walk back to Texas.

618
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,411
No objection to me getting my horse?

619
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:11,275
No, go ahead.
- Thanks.

620
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:27,864
You better get away from there, Doc,
before you get hurt.

621
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:31,593
Doc, Doc, you've gotta tell Bart.

622
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:34,535
Mary was no good.

623
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,247
How can y'all stand around doing nothing

624
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:46,483
when a man's been murdered
right before your eyes?

625
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:47,884
Shut up, Doc!

626
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:51,442
Swede! Swede Hansen, I'm gonna take you,

627
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:54,124
and when I do,
you're gonna see me coming.

628
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,892
I'll be waiting for you, Allison.

629
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,594
And he won't be coming alone!

630
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:00,797
Doc, go on up the street
and join the rest of your fine citizens.

631
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:02,699
Allison! Sam wanted you...

632
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,001
What he wanted
don't make no difference now.

633
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:07,103
Well, if you'd listen to me, I think it might.

634
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:08,838
I ain't listening no more.

635
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:12,142
Where I come from, a lawman don't shoot
an unarmed man in the back,

636
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:14,711
and when he gives his word,
you can count on it.

637
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:20,591
There's liable to be some more shooting,
so everybody off the street.

638
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:31,561
If we're only just going to be spectators
to the next killing,

639
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:35,996
we might as well go inside
and wait with the others.

640
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:57,587
Their consciences will rest easier
if they don't see what happens to Allison.

641
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,956
Doc, if you'd been tending bar
as long as I have,

642
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,959
you wouldn't expect so much
out of the human race.

643
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:08,329
Hey, Otis, come on in here
and start pouring some more whiskey.

644
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,777
Another one.

645
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:36,993
This is still a saloon, Morley.
How about joining me in a drink?

646
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,388
I don't want another drink.

647
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:54,410
How about you joining me,
Mr. Justice of the Peace?

648
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:58,515
Oh, good gracious, no. No, I haven't
touched a drop of whiskey in years.

649
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,016
Is that a fact?

650
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:03,601
The gospel truth. Isn't that right, Otis?

651
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,593
You never fooled anyone, Zaron,

652
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:14,964
so why don't you drink out in the open,
the way a man's supposed to?

653
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,766
Hey, come back here!

654
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:19,068
Leave him alone! Let him go!

655
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:24,307
You had no call to do that.
We all knew that Zaron was a drinking man.

656
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:28,845
I figured it was about time
we let him know that we know.

657
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:32,916
Did you see the old hypocrite's face
when I broke his whiskey bottle?

658
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:36,119
He claims he's gonna be
a real preacher someday.

659
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:42,594
I'll bet he'll never dare get back
in that pulpit again, even for a wedding.

660
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:45,929
Do you all think that's really funny?

661
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:48,231
What's the matter with you, Doc?

662
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:52,669
Why should Zaron be the only man forced
to see himself the way he really is?

663
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,504
Why, if we all faced up to the truth,

664
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:57,574
our heads would be hanging lower
than his is right now.

665
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:59,375
I don't know how you figure that.

666
00:57:59,475 --> 00:58:04,280
We all heard our fine sheriff offer to let
those two men ride out of town unharmed

667
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,498
if they'd come out without their guns.

668
00:58:05,598 --> 00:58:06,716
If they'd come out without their guns.

669
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,384
We all saw what happened.

670
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:10,587
You know dang well
he ain't our sheriff, Doc.

671
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:11,888
He's Kimbrough's sheriff.

672
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,691
But he should be ours, Abe.
This is our town.

673
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,860
We're responsible for everything good
and everything bad that happens in it.

674
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,330
Kimbrough couldn't have changed Sundown
if we hadn't helped him.

675
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:21,864
I ain't never helped Kimbrough.

676
00:58:21,964 --> 00:58:25,900
We've all helped him,
haven't we, Mr. Morley?

677
00:58:25,968 --> 00:58:29,172
By doing nothing, just like we're doing now.

678
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:33,943
Sure, Spanish and the sheriff
pulled the triggers that killed that Texan,

679
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:37,547
but we're all guilty,
just as guilty as they are.

680
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:40,707
And unless we do something about it,

681
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:42,685
there's another killing coming up.

682
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:47,120
You're sure keeping me waiting
a long time, Allison.

683
00:58:54,897 --> 00:58:57,166
There isn't anyone here
who hasn't lost something

684
00:58:57,266 --> 00:58:59,502
since Tate Kimbrough came to town.

685
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:02,372
If we let this chance pass
without doing anything,

686
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:05,475
I doubt that we'll ever get back
what we've lost.

687
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:09,145
I hadn't noticed Mr. Summerton
had lost anything, Doc.

688
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:11,547
He's done pretty well
the last couple of years.

689
00:59:11,647 --> 00:59:16,019
Perhaps you hadn't noticed it,
but I've lost more than anyone else.

690
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,119
I lost my self-respect.

691
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:28,038
Where are you going, Lucy?

692
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,300
What's going on in here?

693
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,803
I don't know, Tate,
but whatever it is, I like it.

694
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:49,686
It wouldn't surprise me, Doc,
if you weren't stirring things up a bit.

695
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:52,081
I've certainly been trying.

696
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:55,723
I'd stop if I were you.

697
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,996
You know, Mr. Morley,

698
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:14,243
I think Allison deserves a better chance
than his partner got.

699
01:00:14,343 --> 01:00:16,343
What do you think?

700
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:20,249
I think you're right, Doc.
You're just as right as rain.

701
01:00:20,349 --> 01:00:24,620
Old Charlie Summerton ain't
the only one that lost his self-respect,

702
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,090
but I aim to do something
about getting mine back.

703
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:29,325
Now, I always figured
that our sheriff was a coward

704
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,861
unless he had all the odds going for him.

705
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:35,998
So, if it's all right with my boys,
we'll go over there

706
01:00:36,098 --> 01:00:39,158
and just even them odds up a little.

707
01:01:18,507 --> 01:01:23,212
I've been waiting for two years
for something like this to happen.

708
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:26,015
Looks like maybe Allison's coming to town
was all we needed

709
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:29,050
to get us back on the right track.

710
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:34,347
All right, up! Up!

711
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,790
Throw it out.

712
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:44,131
Drop 'em!

713
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:47,134
And the belts!

714
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,474
Looks to me, Morley,
like you and your C-Cross boys

715
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:53,142
are going out of your way to make trouble.

716
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:58,281
Maybe so, but we just got to figuring
that a man's got to draw the line someplace

717
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,449
if he's going to go on living with himself.

718
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:02,785
And that's just what we're doing.

719
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,521
Now, Sheriff, if you want that Texan,

720
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:08,024
you're going to have to take him
all by yourself.

721
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:11,194
Interfering with the law
is a pretty serious offense, Morley.

722
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,694
Your boys ain't lawmen.

723
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:16,065
The fact is,
they was pretty decent ranch hands

724
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,201
till Kimbrough put his brand on them.

725
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:20,369
Now, go ahead, do your duty.

726
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:23,529
Jack, give the sheriff back his gun.

727
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:38,471
Maybe we'd best get back inside.

728
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:43,232
Looks like there's gonna be
some more shooting.

729
01:03:06,615 --> 01:03:11,654
Swede, Sam never had a chance
to use his gun, and you won't either.

730
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,754
Start walking.

731
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,802
Doc!

732
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:18,020
Let me see. Come on, let's have a look at it.

733
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,257
Looks like I'm going to have to go over
to that hotel and pry Kimbrough loose.

734
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,160
In half an hour this hand will be so
swollen, you won't be able to use it.

735
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,594
Go over there and sit down.

736
01:04:25,694 --> 01:04:27,997
By that time I'll be finished
what I came here for.

737
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:29,765
Allison, I want you to listen to me.

738
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:32,234
Sam thought more of you
than anyone else in the world.

739
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:33,436
That's why he wouldn't hurt you.

740
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,339
Sam never hurt anybody in his life.
On account of me, he's dead.

741
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,441
It should have been me,
but you can't change things by wishing.

742
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,042
He only wanted...
- Or by talking.

743
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:43,079
And there's some things
you can't change with bullets.

744
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:44,947
It looks like you're doing your job real good,

745
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:49,127
so don't spoil it
by some of your philosophizing.

746
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:55,157
Doc, if it just so happens
I ain't able to bury Sam,

747
01:04:55,257 --> 01:04:58,027
I'd appreciate it if you'd take care of it.

748
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:01,494
I'll take care of it, Bart.
- Thanks.

749
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:26,603
Tate, you're going to be next.

750
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:30,359
How can you find anything to laugh about?
- It's really very funny.

751
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:31,494
Funny?

752
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:36,665
Yeah, that a woman like Mary Allison
can cause all this commotion.

753
01:05:36,765 --> 01:05:37,933
Take me with you?

754
01:05:38,033 --> 01:05:40,033
I can't.
- Please.

755
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,102
I'm not going anyplace.

756
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:45,074
Tate, you can't meet him in a gunfight.
He'll kill you.

757
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:47,977
Or I'll kill him.
It's sure going to be one way or the other.

758
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:50,713
But it doesn't have to be that way
if you left town.

759
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:53,582
I'm staying. I've got a lot of
time and effort in this town.

760
01:05:53,682 --> 01:05:57,762
I had everything my way
until Allison came along.

761
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:15,805
Things aren't going to be the way
you want them any longer, Tate.

762
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:18,407
They're not afraid of you anymore.
Don't you understand?

763
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:20,242
You've lost everything.

764
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:23,079
Once Allison is taken care of,
things will slip right back into place.

765
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:24,914
How can they?
You've lost people like Spanish and Swede.

766
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,082
There's no one left to help you.

767
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:29,118
The world's full of people
like Spanish and Swede.

768
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:33,889
I've just got to get by Allison.
I'll replace them easy enough.

769
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:37,093
Please don't try to shoot it out with him.
- I've got to.

770
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,694
Why?

771
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:40,629
Survival to most people means
just staying alive.

772
01:06:40,729 --> 01:06:42,331
To me it means more than that.

773
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:45,000
There's nothing more important
than staying alive.

774
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,704
Ruby, I haven't got time
to argue the point with you.

775
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:52,119
Well, I'd better start showing my face.

776
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:58,047
It wouldn't do to have people think
that Tate Kimbrough was afraid.

777
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:00,147
But you are afraid.

778
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:08,250
But nobody's going to know about it
but me and you.

779
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,142
Why did you take the sign down, Otis?

780
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:05,937
Well, the way things was going, I figured...
- Put it back up there!

781
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:10,953
Looks like there's a lot of changes
going on today, Tate.

782
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:14,318
I never saw you carrying a gun before.

783
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:18,260
I don't like using a gun,
but I can if I have to.

784
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,697
We all figured that you'd leave town
before you'd face up to Allison

785
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:24,433
without your boys standing by
to help you out.

786
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:26,869
You mean, that's what
you were hoping I'd do, don't you?

787
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:28,537
That's right.

788
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:29,905
Probably Allison don't know it,

789
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:33,175
but he's done this town a lot of good
since he come here.

790
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:37,379
And I'd just hate to see you get lucky
and beat him at the draw.

791
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:40,209
Well, if I do get lucky,

792
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:44,620
you'll find out that things haven't changed
as much as you think.

793
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,589
But that's where you're wrong,

794
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:49,491
'cause no matter what happens
between you and Allison,

795
01:08:49,591 --> 01:08:51,889
you're finished in Sundown.

796
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,363
We'll see, Morley. We'll see.

797
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:58,160
'Vengeance is mine,' saith the Lord.

798
01:08:58,233 --> 01:09:02,104
If you could get that message over
to Allison, you'd save me a lot of trouble.

799
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:03,572
No more, Otis.

800
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:04,807
If you're not going to drink anymore,

801
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:09,327
why don't you go on outside
and get things over with?

802
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:12,179
I'm in no hurry.

803
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,451
No hurry at all.

804
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:38,635
Mr. Allison, you were right.
You did do me a big favor.

805
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:40,834
I came here to help you.

806
01:09:40,909 --> 01:09:43,412
You said I ought to thank you
for stopping the wedding.

807
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:45,180
Well, you were right about that.

808
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,483
But you're wrong about
going down there now.

809
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,618
Tate's already lost everything.

810
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:54,323
The town, the power he had,
me, if he really ever wanted me.

811
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:55,991
Don't you see?
If you go out there and try to kill him...

812
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:59,128
Lucy, now you just stay here inside
with Doc,

813
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:01,228
where you belong.

814
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:50,842
Zaron, your cup finally runneth over.

815
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:55,248
I guess I can't keep Mr. Allison
waiting any longer.

816
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,835
Thanks, Otis.

817
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:34,358
Go tell Otis to pour you a drink.

818
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:44,540
Allison, is this what you've been waiting
three years for?

819
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:44,724
Oh, Tate! Tate!

820
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:53,268
I had to do it to you.
Couldn't let him kill you.

821
01:12:53,368 --> 01:12:56,768
Get up, Kimbrough, and pick up your gun.

822
01:12:58,473 --> 01:13:01,076
Haven't you had enough hate for one day?

823
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:04,780
If you killed Tate and 300 more,
you still couldn't change things.

824
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:10,519
You were married, but you never had a wife.
Do you hear me? You never had a wife.

825
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:14,423
How can you get revenge
for something you never had?

826
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:16,523
Get up, Kimbrough.

827
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:20,093
Stay out of this, Doc.

828
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:21,497
I can't, Allison.

829
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:24,333
Sam said he hoped you'd start living
the way a man should live.

830
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:26,335
The only way you can do that
is to know the truth.

831
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:28,170
He tried to live long enough to tell you.

832
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:32,350
You just heard it from Ruby.
I heard it from Sam.

833
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,615
You're gonna need some patching up
before you leave town.

834
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:41,715
Lucy, get my satchel.

835
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:12,541
Otis, this is a day for a celebration.

836
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:17,346
Oh, boys, come on back in here
and I'll buy drinks for everybody.

837
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:20,336
Fill Mr. Allison's glass up first.

838
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:30,923
I'll pour my drinks myself
and pay for my drinks myself.

839
01:15:30,992 --> 01:15:33,395
But, Allison,
you've done this town a big service.

840
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:36,259
We feel that we...

841
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:38,500
Well, there certainly was no call to do that.

842
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,168
You're an ungrateful cuss, Allison.

843
01:15:40,268 --> 01:15:43,972
If it wasn't for Morley here, you
wouldn't be standing drinking that whiskey.

844
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:47,376
Where I come from,
folks don't celebrate or have a big to-do

845
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:51,079
when a man acts
the way a man's supposed to act.

846
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:53,081
Morley, if you'd remembered you were a man

847
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:55,484
before Swede and Spanish
shot Sam in the back,

848
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:58,389
I'd have joined your celebration.

849
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:03,187
Sorry. I wish I had remembered sooner.

850
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:39,524
John, we just can't let him ride away.

851
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:40,729
If it wasn't for him...

852
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:44,569
Yes, he changed things
for everybody in town.

853
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:47,335
But, unfortunately,
there's nothing we can do for him.

854
01:16:47,435 --> 01:16:48,804
I'll tell you one thing.

855
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:54,854
None of us will ever forget the day
that Bart Allison spent in Sundown.
