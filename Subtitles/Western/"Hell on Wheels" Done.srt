You've met the Colonel, I see.

explaining the difference

00:29:57,466 --> 00:30:00,701
could not have been built
without Thomas Durant.

357
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:07,508
That wasn't an answer.

358
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,976
I'll ask again.

359
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:11,478
As a former employee
of the Union Pacific,

360
00:30:11,514 --> 00:30:13,847
did Thomas Durant ever
voice his intention to

361
00:30:13,883 --> 00:30:15,916
or offer any bribes to
an elected official?

362
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:21,055
The transcontinental railroad could not
have been built without Thomas Durant.

363
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:24,091
Mr. Bohannon, you have sworn an oath

364
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:26,860
before this committee
under penalty of perjury.

365
00:30:26,896 --> 00:30:31,832
We have a dozen Senators on record saying
Thomas Durant attempted to bribe them,

366
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:35,235
are you disputing their
account of the facts?

367
00:30:36,005 --> 00:30:37,905
The fact I know to be true

368
00:30:38,674 --> 00:30:40,674
is that the transcontinental railroad

369
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,278
could not have been built
without Thomas Durant.

370
00:30:44,313 --> 00:30:47,047
This committee has the authority
to hold you in contempt, Colonel.

371
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,283
You have the right to
detain me, Governor,

372
00:30:49,318 --> 00:30:51,151
but that won't change the fact

373
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,021
that the transcontinental railroad
could not have been built

374
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:56,557
- without...
- BOTH: Thomas Durant.

375
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:06,200
Thank you, Colonel. That'll be all.

376
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:22,750
ED: The lecture circuit
won't know what hit them.

377
00:31:22,785 --> 00:31:25,619
First stop, Council Bluffs,
day after tomorrow.

378
00:31:26,122 --> 00:31:28,122
But the book isn't written yet.

379
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,957
The book will come,
don't worry about that.

380
00:31:29,992 --> 00:31:33,460
In the meantime, your face tells
the story better than any book.

381
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:36,463
LOUISE: Maybe we should
go over the details.

382
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:38,665
Yes. Walk us through it, Mrs. Toole.

383
00:31:39,702 --> 00:31:42,035
You were headed West with your family

384
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:44,104
when you were attacked by Wild Mojave...

385
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,773
- Yavapai.
- Sorry?

386
00:31:47,476 --> 00:31:48,776
It was...

387
00:31:48,811 --> 00:31:50,077
(SIGHS)

388
00:31:50,112 --> 00:31:51,879
We was attacked by Yavapai.

389
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:53,380
Apache.

390
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:56,817
Then they traded me to the Mojave
for three blankets and a horse.

391
00:31:57,253 --> 00:31:59,052
Three blankets and a horse.

392
00:31:59,655 --> 00:32:01,688
The price of a human soul.

393
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:03,056
Great detail. Possible title.

394
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:04,825
- Remember that, Ms. Ellison.
- Mmm.

395
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,896
So, the Mojave marked your
face and made you their slave.

396
00:32:08,931 --> 00:32:10,631
No. Not exactly.

397
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:12,399
(CHUCKLING) How would you describe it?

398
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:16,971
They...

399
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:20,007
Everyone had marks but...

400
00:32:21,477 --> 00:32:25,179
The point is to let Mrs. Toole

401
00:32:25,214 --> 00:32:27,447
tell her story in her own words.

402
00:32:28,517 --> 00:32:29,950
Go ahead, Eva.

403
00:32:29,985 --> 00:32:31,385
We won't interrupt.

404
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,190
It was hard at first

405
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:39,226
because I missed my momma.

406
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:41,428
But then I had me a Mojave...

407
00:32:46,135 --> 00:32:48,468
Had me a Mojave sister and...

408
00:32:52,074 --> 00:32:55,309
I'm sorry, this dress just
don't seem to fit right.

409
00:32:55,344 --> 00:32:58,045
(STUTTERS) But, the dress
is part of the story,

410
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,881
it indicates you... You've been saved.

411
00:33:03,953 --> 00:33:05,586
Saved from what?

412
00:33:05,621 --> 00:33:06,820
(SCOFFS)

413
00:33:06,856 --> 00:33:08,722
From a life of savagery, of course.

414
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:16,897
The marked face and the dress, we
can't have one without the other.

415
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:18,432
Not now, Ed.

416
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,472
I can't do this.

417
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:26,773
Eva, we'll get a different dress.

418
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:28,508
No, it ain't the dress.

419
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,213
The railroad is finished, Eva.

420
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,283
What else will you do?

421
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:38,385
This is the best that you can hope for.

423
00:33:42,091 --> 00:33:44,024
Oh, God, I...

424
00:33:47,363 --> 00:33:48,763
I'm sorry. I...

425
00:33:56,105 --> 00:33:57,505
I love you, Louise.

426
00:33:59,408 --> 00:34:01,008
But I promised myself

427
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:02,676
I'm done whoring.

428
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,747
Good luck in Chicago.

429
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,360
(GUNSHOT)

430
00:34:22,965 --> 00:34:24,898
You're one hell of a shot.

431
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:27,501
Plenty of practice.

432
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:29,202
Too bad for the Apache.

433
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:30,971
That's where you're heading, right?

434
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:32,139
Arizona territory?

435
00:34:32,174 --> 00:34:33,574
Ship out tomorrow.

436
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,944
Apache women are turned on by gore.

437
00:34:38,013 --> 00:34:40,280
Fornicate like rabbits
once the killing's done,

438
00:34:40,316 --> 00:34:42,249
you barely have to force them.

439
00:34:42,818 --> 00:34:45,652
Got myself a few trap
trophies from Arizona,

440
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:47,688
had 'em stitched into coin purses.

441
00:34:47,723 --> 00:34:49,123
No.

442
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:51,825
It ain't that kind of assignment.

443
00:34:52,861 --> 00:34:55,362
Just bringin' a couple
of renegades is all.

444
00:34:55,397 --> 00:34:57,130
Grant tell you that?

445
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:00,300
He's a politician, I suppose he has to.

446
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:05,473
You're a killer.

447
00:35:06,175 --> 00:35:07,975
You know what happens in the fog of war.

448
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:24,091
Got to go see to the wife before I go.

449
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:26,193
Keep up with my conjugal duties,

450
00:35:26,228 --> 00:35:27,728
lest she turn to the postman.

451
00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:30,130
You got yourself a girl?

452
00:35:33,969 --> 00:35:36,169
That's for the best. Kes you focused.

453
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,973
Don't worry about Grant's bullshit.

454
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:41,808
You'll ship out, kill some Injuns,

455
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:45,012

back to Washington a hero.

It's all right, my son.

No man is without sin,
but you can be forgiven.

Do you seek salvation?

Thomas Durant will invoke
his fifth amendment right

470
00:39:15,264 --> 00:39:17,564
as secured by the constitution
of the United States.

471
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,335
Mr. Durant, we have sworn testimony
corroborating the charges against you,

472
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:27,207
am I clear you are choosing to let these
charges go unanswered by you here today?

Mmm-hmm.

474
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,244
As is your constitutional right,

475
00:39:31,513 --> 00:39:34,781
so long as you're aware
the record of history

476
00:39:34,816 --> 00:39:37,417
will remember Thomas
Durant as a criminal.

477
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:39,619
The record of history?

478
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:41,454
That's right, Mr. Durant.

will read, however,

the handful of overfed
Senators in this room

482
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:51,498
who choose to write it.

483
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:56,069
I'm not interested in the
record of history...

Mr. Durant, please.

00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:00,106

with my own eyes out West.

488

the American people, torn apart by war,

490
00:40:18,193 --> 00:40:22,095
cried out into the darkness
and turned a hopeful ear

491
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,230
to the void for an answer.

492
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,500
Americans needed a dream

493
00:40:28,403 --> 00:40:29,903
and I gave them one.

494
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:36,643

railroad that would unite

don't come simple...

1,776 miles of iron track,

502
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:12,178

can accomplish great things.

driven by their cowardly

The patsy. Sent into the wilderness

517
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,677
so that men sitting in this room

518
00:42:17,712 --> 00:42:19,813
can lay their sins upon my back,

519
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:22,115
and claim they themselves are clean.

520
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:29,022
Men enjoying immunity while
enriching themselves on the backs

521
00:42:29,391 --> 00:42:33,126
of those who sacrificed everything

522
00:42:33,161 --> 00:42:39,161
to make manifest America's destiny.

523
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:41,745
Lives have been lost.

524
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,047
Men have been ruined.

525
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:48,685
I saw it, and I survived.

526
00:42:57,563 --> 00:43:03,233
I will not return from the wild
having made America's dream a reality

527
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:09,506
only to have six bureaucrats
in starched collars judge

528
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:13,743
the manner in which I
realized that dream.

529
00:43:18,217 --> 00:43:22,152
Put me on trial, lock me in prison,

530
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,189
erase me from the record.

531
00:43:30,128 --> 00:43:32,262
For history is written in pencil...

532
00:43:35,734 --> 00:43:40,770
And the truth is carved in
steel across this nation.

533
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:46,910
And one truth above
all others is this...

534
