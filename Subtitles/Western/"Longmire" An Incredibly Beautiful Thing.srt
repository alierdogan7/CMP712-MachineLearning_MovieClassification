between man and nature.

right toward the front door.

from that direction.

188

about this woman.

189
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:36,111
How about a cash reward?
The Maces could afford it.

190
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:37,345

on their own daughter.

here in Cumberland county,

that your company

231

Huh.

is more important...

that pays his salary.

from the local police force.

is... it's a company car.

It's used by Leland Townes.

He's not really an employee,
technically.

Herderite doesn't occur
naturally in Wyoming.

Yeah.

The land went to hay
