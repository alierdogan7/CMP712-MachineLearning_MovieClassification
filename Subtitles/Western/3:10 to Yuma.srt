This place, does it keep your boss busy?

174
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,395
No. He does other things too.

175
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,063
Like what other things?

176
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,400
He has like a little bank,
and he loans money to ranchers.

177
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,736
What does he do?
Does he keep the money here?

178
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,488
[Sighs]
See, he doesn't have any money anymore.

179
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,907
What with the drought, nobody pays back.

180
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,076
That's too bad.
[Chuckles]

181
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,705
Miss, if my outfit's
asking you too many questions...

182
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,874
well, you just say so, huh?

183
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,251
See, we've been on a cattle drive
for about three months...

184
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,087
and when you walk into
a place like this and...

185
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,005
see a nice girl like you -

186
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,425
Well, it's nice.

187
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,762
How far away is the Mexican border?

188
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,726
Nobody knows exactly.
It's never been decided.

189
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,144
I think we can find it all right.

190
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,983
When the marshal wakes up, you tell him
that the coach from Contention was robbed.

191
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,234
And you tell him the driver was killed, huh?

192
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,405
- Killed?
- Killed.

193
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,952
Oh. Oh, if there's a killin',
I'm supposed to wake him.

194
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,078
It's only robbery
he don't wanna be waked for.

195
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,539
- Marshal!
- [Knocking]

196
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,836
Wake up. The coach has been robbed
and Bill Moons was killed.

197

Marshal, Bill Moons was killed.
These fellas outside seen it.

198
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,840
How far back was it?

199
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,636
- It was about 10 miles.
- They took the horses too.

200
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,516
Did you hear that, Marshal?

201
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,601
Why didn't you fellas try and help?

202
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,228
We were all strung out.

203
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,313
We didn't see it till we looked
back up here at the pass.

204
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,981
That's right.

205
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,857
Go get everybody.

206
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,336
Where you fellas from?

207
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,047
- Prairie Cattle Company.
- I didn't know they got this far.

208
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,883
Well, you see, they just bought
60,000 head down in Mexico...

209
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,969
and they sent us down there
to drive 'em in.

210
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,762
Then you won't be staying in town long?

211
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,805
No, just long enough to have a drink.

212
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,319
Alex Potter!

213
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,909
I told you he had rheumatism!

214
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,745
Anyway, he sold his horse.
Now, you know that.

215

[Bartender]
He can use one of my horses.

217
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,674
Suspicious old goat.

218
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,472
- Where's Alex Potter?
- Sleeping it off, I guess.

219
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,266
I don't think he wants to leave town
with us here.

220
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,855
Scatter and cross the border.
We'll meet in Nogales tonight.

What's holding up the boss?

Don't worry about him.
He'll be along.

223

- Yeah. And Velvet, do you remember her?
- Mm-hmm.

242
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,623
Shoot. I spent 300 in one night on Velvet.

243
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,836
Hey, I remember
they had real Paris dresses there...

I mean, what's a woman for
if you don't treat her right?

246
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:59,345
I'd have spent every cent I had on her,
except she married the governor of the state.

247
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,814
Is there many young fellas

I don't mind a skinny girl...

to make up for it.

You got blue eyes?

Brown.

That's all right.
They don't have to be blue.

- We just come from Bisbee.

Didn't you see an outfit ride through?

why don't we catch him?

So we catch him.

- We'll arrest him.

Till his outfit comes back
and shoots up the town?

296
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,630
No one's ever held him yet.

297
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,674
We could grab him,
get him out of town quick.

298

00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,309
Now, is there anything else
you want to get paid for?

343
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,105
I'll tell ya. If it's all right with you...

344
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,274
you can give me two dollars extra
for making me nervous.

345
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,280
Don't move.

346
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,576
It's the marshal.
He's got a shotgun on you, Wade.

347
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,787
Put your hands up.

348
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,169
Ben!

349
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,298
- Watch him.
- I'll watch him.

350
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,015
Now, what good is all that?

351
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,100
You know, he's only gonna
come back with the others...

352
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,976
and I'll go free.

353
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,355
And you'll get shot.

354
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,399
Mister, we're gonna get you out of town
so fast you won't touch ground.

355
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,151
Come on. Over here.

356
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,658
Sit down there.

357
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,164
Here, take this.

358
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,835
Wait a minute. I helped out this far.
Now I'm finished.

359
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,129
- You're what?
- I said I'm finished.

360
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,965
I come into town on business.

361
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,801
Look, my cattle's dyin'.
I gotta take care of 'em.

362
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,427
Dan, you're the best shot we got.

363
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,305
Well, that - That's not my job.
I'm no deputy.

364

You are now.
Every man here's a deputy.

365
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,435
Look, I was just coming
into town to see Mac here.

366
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,896
So I don't mind helping out,
but that's all.

367
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,774
I can't spare the time,
not unless I want to lose everything.

368
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,525
It won't make any difference.

369
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,237
Mac, you watch him.

370
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,496
Can I talk to you a minute, uh, Mac?

371
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,124
What's it about, Dan?

372
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,921
Well, it's a business thing, you know?

374
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,049
Thanks.

375
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,264
The way I figure it,
the faster we get him out of here, the safer.

376
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,099
That's right. We'll outsmart 'em.

377
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,268
Every step, we'll outsmart 'em.

378
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,479
We only got two, three hours head start.

379
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,441
They'll probably figure we're gonna
take him over to Fort Huachuca.

380
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,152
- Turn him in there.
- Sure they will. [Sniffles]

381
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,904
And if they don't figure that,
they'll figure we'll take him to Benson.

382
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,406
That's a fact.

383
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,325
And if they don't figure that...

384
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,951
then they'll figure
we'll take him over to Contention...

385
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,287
put him on the 3:10 to Yuma.

386
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,955
Sure they will. Bound to.

387
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,083
Alex, will you let me finish?
Then you can agree.

388
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,377
Oh, sure, I will.

389
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,883
Now, the minute the coach comes,
we'll put him on it and start.

390
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,384
- Start where?
- That's where we fool 'em.

391
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,555
Look, here's Benson.

392
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,768
Here's Contention.

393
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,480
And here's Fort Huachuca.

394
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,024
It would only be for six months.
We're bound to have rain by then.

395
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,319
Rain?

396
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,487
Sure, everybody would prosper.

I still couldn't help you.

be gettin' back home.

- For what?

405
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,018
I'm not telling you for what.

406
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,479
I want two of you
to set off with Dave Keene.

407
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,523

with the prisoner in the coach.

We gotta know
what we're getting ourselves into.

410
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,696
Sure. Might not be safe.

411

Safe. Who knows what's safe?

from looking at his wife.

416
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,754
I'll pay $200 to each man.

417
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,881
I'll volunteer.

418
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,425
Why, I thought you said
you couldn't spare -

419
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,344
- Do you want me, or don't you?
- Why, sure we want you.

Here, take this shotgun.

Now, do I have another?

422
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
I'll go.

Oh. Now, wait a minute, Alex.
Oh, no offense.

if we had somebody else.

We thank Thee for food.

We ask Thee to give us the wisdom
that comes with silence.

513
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,685
Amen.

514
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,687
I didn't close my eyes once.

515
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,732
I just squinted, 'cause you could run away.

516
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:24,027
Why would I want to run away?
Why, this is real nice. Real nice.

517
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,824
Uh, would you like me
to cut your meat for you?

518
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,035
Oh, yeah. Will you, please?
Thank you.

519
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,208
Would you mind
cutting the fat off, please?

- Me.

523
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,434
I thought I saw something moving
out there in the carriage shed.

524
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,560
You shouldn't have done that.
They could've heard.

525
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,271
Guess I just got kind of spooky.

526
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,859
I was in San Francisco once. I -

527
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,778
I knew a girl there.

528
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,906
And she was the daughter
of a sea captain too.

529
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,534
And she had the greenest eyes.

530
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,828
I used to look real deep into her eyes...

531
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,580
and they'd - and they'd just
change colors, you know.

You know, all the colors of the sea.

- You know what I mean.

They wouldn't know he's here, would they?

544
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,968
Oh, no. They think he's in the coach.
That's how we planned it.

- Go get the horses.

547
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,230
- Well, which ones?
- They're saddled.

548
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,484
What happens when they catch the coach?

549
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,780
Well, they'll have
to round their men up first...

550
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:34,200
so they shouldn't be able
to catch up to it at least till noon.

551
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,035
And they'll find out he isn't in it.

552
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,829
By then, we'll be in Contention, and -

553
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,830
They couldn't get there in time anyway.

554
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,503
Alex, turn down the lamp.

555
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,337
And when the horses come,
bring him out.

556
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,974
I don't want you to be worried, 'cause this
is a lot safer than being with the coach.

No. All I saw was Wade.

see my wife from here.

was a room at the hotel.

01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:15,661
What? What do you mean
he's out of town?

854
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,704
He took a prisoner to Tucson.

855
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,416
Well, we'll do it without him.

856
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,417
Mr. Moons, are you with us?

857
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:27,131
Yeah, if it's a fair fight,
sure, I'd stay for that.

858
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,257
Fair fight, that's a man's duty.

859
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:33,262
But this way - I mean,
this is a big outfit, Wade's gang.

860
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:34,763
A tough outfit.

861
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:38,226
Another time, but you know,
my mother, I got to think of her.

862
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,603
- One son just buried.
- Go on. Go on. Get out.

863
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,615
I'm sure I can get some help.

864
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:56,451
Even five.

865
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,831
Five more men
would at least give us a chance.

866
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,124
Oh, five would be easy.

867
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:05,293
Certainly, in a town this size,
you ought to be able to get five.

868
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:23,144
Well, the street seems to be clearing.
Everybody going inside.

869
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:27,607
I guess they figure
a storm is blowing up, huh, Dan?

870
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,293
- Any news?
- Not a word.

871
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:48,670
Think they'll find out
where Alex and Dan took Wade?

872
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:52,675
I don't know,
but I'm not gonna take the chance.

873
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,718

Hey, Dan, you like a girl singing?

880
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:06,081
I don't know. It kind of keeps a man
from working too hard.

881
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,792
Puts his mind at rest.

882
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:13,506

Almost 2:30?

886
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:33,233
Well, that, um - that leaves you
one-half hour to decide, huh?

they won't come right up.

Yeah.

And that means Butterfield too.
He'll walk out on you, Dan.

No, he won't. He'll stick. I can tell.

He's human.

Now, what do you figure
you're gonna die for, huh?

1001
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:34,482
Because Butterfield
lost his gold shipment? Hmm?

1002
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,819
Or because some fool driver
got what he deserved?

1003
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,366
I'm going up to talk to Dan.

1004
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,450
You watch out from here.

1005
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:01,133
Drop the gun.

01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,123
Take good care of him.

1009
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:36,877
Dan, open up.

1010
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,550
- What happened to Alex?
- I don't know. I heard shots.

1011
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:45,429
I ran back to the stairs. Then they
were dragging him towards the hotel.

[Alex]
Dan! Dan!

1013
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:52,352
Well, I guess that leaves just the two of you.

1014
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:55,439
If there's one more shot, I shoot you.

1015
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,064
Tell 'em.

1016
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:03,780
Hey, Charlie?

1017
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,657
You've got one more shot.

1018
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:07,242
Make it good.

1019
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:10,161
Tell 'em we'll use it
on the way to the station.

1020
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,293
Go see what they did to Alex.

1021
