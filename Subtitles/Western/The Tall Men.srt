00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,648
Looks like we're getting
close to civilization.

2
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,095
<i>I wouldn't give half an acre
of Texas for the whole Montana Territory.</i>

<i>[ Honky-tonk Piano ]</i>

4
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:40,815
- Howdy.
- Evening.

5
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:43,911
We need some feed and a couple stalls.

6
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:47,276
That'll be $16 overnight, gold or silver.

7
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:50,158
We ain't aiming to buy you out, mister.

8
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:53,419
Ain't aiming to sell. It's still $16.

9
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,342
- In advance.
- That's Yankee talk.

10
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,024
Never mind.
My brother don't know the war's over.

11
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:00,996
You got $16?

12
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:03,111
Uh, we're a little short of funds.

13
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:05,736
<i>Then you boys better be on your way.</i>

14
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,228
I figured you might be in a trading mood.

15
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:10,506
For instance?

16
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:14,120
Well, uh, one genuine Yankee saber.

17
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:16,045
Oh, and this fancy timepiece.

18
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:19,884
Solid gold.
Used to belong to a live general.

19
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:22,830
And a fine pair of field glasses.

20
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:26,788
You with the reb army?

21
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:28,716
In a left-handed sort of way.

22
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:31,433
- Quantrill's Raiders.
- Mighty tough outfit.

23
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:33,357
So I've heard.

24
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,592
How, uh, far do these things reach?

25
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:37,833
Four or five miles.

26
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:41,196
I'll trade you the whole kit and kaboodle
for $50 over your 16.

27
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,892
- Might give you 20.
- Thirty.

28
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:47,908
Twenty-five. That's my limit.

29
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:52,040
Mister, you just bought your self
a parcel of Yankee souvenirs.

30
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,499
Well, gents, help your selves...

31
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:57,420
to the feed and stall space.

32
00:03:57,518 --> 00:04:00,301
You want your horses before sun up,
just come and take 'em.

33
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:02,286
Door's always open.

34
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,572
- Never mind the saddles.
- Reckon this'll be a quick one, huh?

35
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:08,557
Could be.

00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:38,120
<i>Come on, seven.! Pay off.</i>

43
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:47,236
No way in or out back there.

44
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:49,165
A lot of action inside.

45
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:00,676
- Craps again.
- [ Chattering, Muttering ]

46
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:08,746
Never saw such a herd
of hard-rock gophers in my life.

47
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:10,983
Gold's what they grow here, not beef.

48
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:13,867
- Clint. You need remindin'?
- No.

49
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:16,748
We're here on business.
lots of looking, very little drinking.

50
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:19,300
- And the war's over.
- Yep. The war's over.

51
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,451
- What'll it be?
- What do you drink in Montana, friend?

52
00:05:29,549 --> 00:05:32,330
Too blamed much.
Fractured, or all of a piece?

53
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:34,251
A couple of snorts.

54
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,645
That'll be eight dollars in greenbacks,
five in silver or a pinch of dust.

55
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,391
Mmm. Expensive, living hereabouts, huh?

56
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:42,500
If you call it living.

57
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:46,504
Sure ain't slept in a barrel long.

58
00:05:46,604 --> 00:05:50,345
Nothing gets a chance to age in a boomtown,
mister. Not even the people.

59
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:52,331
Mild as milk juice.

60
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:10,219
How's about another snort?

61
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:13,577
Easy, boy. let's not foul this up.

62
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:17,766
You're calling the turns in this deal, Ben.

63

Take a look. The fancy Jasper.

65
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:45,250

00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:13,280
- Evening, Mr. Stark. Buy you a drink?
- My pleasure. Gus.

69
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:16,233
Hear you're riding to Butte tonight.

70
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:19,233
Yes. After I leave,
set 'em up for the boys.

71

Hope you'll be heading back here soon.</i>

73
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,315

76
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,650
Get your hands up,Jasper.

77
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:57,995
Keep 'em up.

78
00:08:00,394 --> 00:08:02,283
Now peel off that money belt.

79
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:06,378
Freeze it.

80
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:14,858
Thought I raised you neater than that.

81
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,349
Now you can unfasten that money belt
and pass it over real slow.

82
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,751
Is that all?

83
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,152
- Or do you want my watch too?
- Keep it.

84
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,072
We're traveling now.

85
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,472
We're real taken
with your company, Mr. Stark.

86
00:08:30,571 --> 00:08:32,392
I'm afraid I can't say the same.

87
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:35,272
Fact is, we're so taken
that we can't leave you.

88
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,818
Can't have you rousing out those vigilantes
on a cold night like this.

89
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:41,704
If you're gonna kill me,
get it over with now.

90
00:08:41,802 --> 00:08:44,583
Move over a shade, Ben.
Allow me to accommodate the gentleman.

91
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:47,464
<i>All I said was, we didn't want
to leave you here.</i>

92
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:49,383
I'm hoping we don't have to.

93
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,514
You coming, mister, or staying?

94
00:08:54,474 --> 00:08:56,295
You're dealing.

95
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:58,980
- I guess I'm riding.
- Saddle your horse.

96
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:26,887

We bunked here night before last.

[ Clint ]
Quiet as a graveyard, ain't it, Mr. Stark?

98
00:09:35,945 --> 00:09:37,832
Sit down, Mr. Stark.

99
00:09:43,464 --> 00:09:46,246
Hate to lose a man who talks
like a college professor...

100
00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:48,167
but we've brought you far enough.

101
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:50,087
Tomorrow Clint'll
pick up some supplies.

102
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:52,967
You can take your share
and hightail it back.

103
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:54,952
- Minus my money?
- Yeah, minus.

104
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:58,824
Would you, uh, care for a cigar?

105
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,112
Thank you.

106
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:06,312
How about you?

107
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:19,775
If you open that belt, you'll find nothing
but mint-fresh hundred-dollar bills.

108
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,263
The kind that crackle?
[ Chuckles ] That's what I like.

109
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:25,190
Spending them won't be easy.

110
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:27,111
You'll leave a trail so wide...

111
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,754
the Pinkertons'll be on you
like buzzards on a dead mule.

112
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:33,955
And who's to tell the Pinkertons?
You?

113
00:10:35,143 --> 00:10:38,308
You're making it tough
on yourself, Mr. Stark.

114
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:41,255
I'm not trying to make it tough.
Only tempting.

115
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:45,222
Never could resist temptation.

116
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,079
Will you answer just one question?

117
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,453
- [ Hammer Cocks ]
- Ask it.

118
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:56,290
What were steers selling at
when you left Texas?

119
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:59,174
We haven't been home in four years.

120
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:01,574
Three and four dollars a head,
and no takers.

121
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:04,323
- Of all the stupid, stalling-
- What are you driving at?

122
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:09,126
What we buy in Texas,
we sell for $50 a head in Montana.

123
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:13,958
You mean you'd drive a herd 1 ,500 miles,
all the way from Texas to Mineral City?

124
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:16,838
- I had meant to.
- He's loco, Ben.

125
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:19,717
I was planning to go to Texas,
but I'm no cattleman.

126
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:21,954
I knew I'd need a trail boss.

127
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,877
Now, ain't that too bad.

128
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,797
But it's not too late.

129
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:29,311
My offer still goes. We split 50-50
on every cow we bring into Montana alive.

130
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:31,782
- Ha!
- Can't you see how big this is?

131
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:34,049
I'm offering you half the chips...

132
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,380
in the biggest game you ever
had the chance to sit in.

133
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,650
A chance for big money-
honest money.

134
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:42,534
More than you could ever make
in a lifetime.

135
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:47,333
And against that, what have you? Spending
a few thousand, and then prison. Or hanging.

136
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,522
<i>It's dealer's choice, hermano.</i>

137
00:11:59,623 --> 00:12:02,208
A chance to make something
for ourselves.

138
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:04,677
With him holding the joker.

139
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:07,873
I don't like the game, Ben,
but you call it.

140
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:12,763
Do you realize there hasn't been a mouthful of
beefsteak in Montana since before the war?

141
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,126
We'll gamble.
Give him back his money belt.

142
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:20,037
You carry the bankroll, Mr. Stark.

143
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:22,206
We'll carry the guns.

144
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,514
A man couldn't ask
for better protection.

145
00:12:55,975 --> 00:13:00,165
- What do we do now?
- We short-cut it straight across.

146
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:03,044
Pretty rugged. Only an Indian
could get through that.

147
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:08,379
We ain't mentioned it afore, Mr. Stark,
but me and Ben is quarter-blood Comanche.

148
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,717
[ Rifle Cocks ]

149
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,235
Well, get down. Don't just sit there.

150
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,155
Get yourselves some shelter.

151
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,141
Henry, put the horses up.

152
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,497
Make yourselves to home.
I reckon we got a little coffee left.

153
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:09,826
Thanks, Grandma.

154
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:11,812
Grandma?

155
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:25,762
Here, drink some of this.
It'll warm you up.

156
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,642
Well, go ahead.
I ain't gonna bite you.

157
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,523
I don't know.
Those teeth look pretty sharp to me.

158
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,402
Well, they oughta be. They haven't
had anything to eat in three days.

159
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:37,052
- What?
- Well, take a look for yourself.

160
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:41,887
Them folks are starving.

161
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:45,055
From the looks of you,
you ain't doing any better.

162
00:14:45,156 --> 00:14:47,196
No. We lost our packhorse.

163
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:53,407
<i>[ Ben ] Maybe you're not
as empty-handed as you think.</i>

164
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:57,852
You ain't thinking
of butchering one of our mules.

165
00:14:57,956 --> 00:15:01,634
That's no mule, Grandma.
That's a Missouri elk.

166
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:03,554
You just start setting the table.

167
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,434
How we gonna get our wagons
out of here without mules?

168
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,314
You starve to death,
you won't need any wagons.

169

will you, Grandma?

341
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,420
All right.

- [ Clears Throat ]
- This way.

343
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:31,862
You know something?
You do remind me of my grandma.

344
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:33,780
Yeah.

345
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:37,489
The way she must've looked when Grandpa
Allison bought her from old Stone Bear.

346
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,795
Cost him six horses, a musket, uh...

347
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:42,131
and his fancy gold snuffbox.

348
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:44,596
You know, that's a heap
to pay for a woman.

349
00:29:44,694 --> 00:29:47,060
But the old boy
never seemed to regret it...

350
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:49,527
although I do think
he missed his snuffbox.

351
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,957
Now, me- I don't use it.

352
00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:54,640
No snuffbox, no deal.

353
00:29:54,741 --> 00:29:57,361
I could shop around some.

354
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:05,997
You know, a funny thing-

355
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:09,551
two months ago, the only future I had
was the wrong end of a rope.

356
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:12,557
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

357
00:30:12,663 --> 00:30:16,918
Clint and me turned bad men,
held up that Nathan Stark fella.

358
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:21,771
- I thought you were partners.
- We are now, in a cattle deal.

359
00:30:21,878 --> 00:30:24,977
I got a hunch, Nella, that something
great's gonna come out of it.

360
00:30:25,078 --> 00:30:27,925
Not ''big'' great,
the way Stark sees things...

361
00:30:28,023 --> 00:30:30,095
but ''little'' great.

362
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:34,606
<i>- And that's good enough for me.
- ''Big'' great pays off better.</i>

363
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:37,393
All I want is a little ranch
in my home country...

364
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:39,696
along Prairie Dog Creek.

365
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:42,645
Ain't anything like it in the world.

The world's bigger than that, Ben.
You just haven't looked.

367
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,084
I looked plenty.

00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:50,604
Four years of war,
watching men scrabble over life...

369
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,749
like coyotes over a kill.

370
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:55,701
And for what?
Did they eat better, sleep better?

371
00:30:57,335 --> 00:31:00,498
A corner's all I want...

372
00:31:00,598 --> 00:31:02,485
with the right kind of woman.

373
00:31:05,526 --> 00:31:07,893
You ever been
in my part ofTexas, Nella?

374
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:11,056
No. But there's
something better someplace.

375
00:31:11,157 --> 00:31:13,907
There's just gotta be.

376
00:31:14,004 --> 00:31:17,650
Maybe so. Maybe right here.

377
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,418
You sure give a honey and molasses
flavor to this rabbit.

378
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:32,623
That's not honey and molasses.

That's just girl.

- Ben.
- Yeah?

381
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,878
How much you figure your share
of the cattle drive?

382
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,217
Mmm, it depends on luck.

383
00:31:55,316 --> 00:31:59,278
High as 50,000, low as plain nothing.

384
00:31:59,382 --> 00:32:01,868
Nobody ever got through
on this kind of drive.

385
00:32:01,972 --> 00:32:04,077
You will.

386
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:07,727
[ Chuckles ]
I sure got a double reason for trying.

387
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:13,460
You know, with $50,000-
even half of that-

388
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,978
you could buy a big business...

389
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:18,734
maybe out in California.

390
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:22,132
Honey, when you see
that prairie dog country...

391
00:32:22,228 --> 00:32:25,740
you wouldn't swap it
for anything else.

392
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:29,456
The house will sit square
on top of the hill...

393
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:32,207
looking down at the river.

394
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:34,315
Yeah, I know.

395
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,874
Two rooms to start,
but it'll grow, gradual-like...

396
00:32:36,979 --> 00:32:40,078
and maybe three, four rooms.

397
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:42,798
Yeah. Slow and easy.

398
00:32:45,075 --> 00:32:47,498
You tied to that dream, Ben?

399
00:32:47,604 --> 00:32:49,938
Tighter than a cinch strap.

400
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:52,403
Even if I feel different?

401
00:32:55,316 --> 00:32:58,547
Well, I guess I was wrong
in not asking.

402
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:02,834
I kinda took it for granted
that we feel the same about things.

403
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:08,236
Not about ranch living.

404
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,405
I had all of that I could stand
when I was a kid.

405
00:33:12,788 --> 00:33:14,511
It couldn't have been that bad.

406
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:20,173
I wish I could show you a picture
of my ma on her wedding day.

407
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:22,162
She was beautiful-

408
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:25,904
all alive with hopes and plans
for the future.

409
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,995
I was only 1 2 when she died.

410
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,390
She wasn't beautiful anymore...

411
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,312

No more hopes, no plans.

414
00:33:43,474 --> 00:33:47,304
That's just one side of the picture, Nella-
the hard-luck side.

415
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:53,928
Don't it depend a little
on who you're with...

416
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,817
and how you feel about each other?

417
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:01,426
My pop loved Mom.

418
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:05,384
There wasn't any man could've
loved a woman more than he did.

419
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:08,174
No, it was ranch livin'-

420
00:34:08,275 --> 00:34:12,071
dirty, mangy, sod-busting living
that killed her.

Happy?

424
00:34:22,162 --> 00:34:24,105

and chipped enamel cups...

where there ain't none to be found...

before your cows are all frozen dead?

I won't let it be.

a thousand times.

00:41:32,652 --> 00:41:36,163
Only that people often
get attached on a long trip.

511
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,260
Why the sudden interest, Mr. Stark?

512
00:41:40,363 --> 00:41:43,910
I didn't notice you riding back
to Timpas Grove when those Sioux hit us.

00:41:53,995 --> 00:41:57,192
- How long do you intend staying?
- That depends on the price.

Well, uh, dollar and a half a night,
nine dollars for the week.

- Never mind, Clerk.

''What's that supposed to mean?''

Only that hot water and a tub
go well together...

a beautiful woman.

You may waste the words,
but you sure don't waste much time.

I guess we better get something straight.
