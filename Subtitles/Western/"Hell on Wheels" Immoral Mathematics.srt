You can always move down
to the slaughterhouse.

183
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,061
And what if we refuse to move?

184
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:51,278
And I thought you was the smart one.

[Rooster crowing]

186
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,539
You know I used to be a bookkeeper.

187
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,044
You look like a bookkeeper.

188
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,440
Hmm. I was always more comfortable
around numbers than people.

189
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,967
I could control numbers.

190
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:57,344
The war put a stop
to that, didn't it?

191
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:04,977
You're suffering from the
soldier's heart, Mr. Swede.

192
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:07,897
I can see it in your eyes.

193
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,608
You're still fighting them battles.

194
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,129
I saw no battles.

195
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:14,070
I was a quartermaster.

196
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,573
More numbers.

197
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,939
Hmm. I never even saw the enemy

198
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:25,243
until our supply train
was captured and...

199
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:29,085
I become prisoner of war.

state of Georgia.

203
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:44,016
Total chaos ruled.

I weighed 200 pounds when I
went in and 86 when I come out.

206
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,990
I just couldn't
make them numbers add up.

207
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:05,542
I woke one night to one of my own men

208
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,332
trying to eat the flesh from my arm.

209
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,292
He thought I was dead.

210
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:15,494
I realized that night
I had to control people

211
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:18,631
like I controlled numbers

212
00:20:18,756 --> 00:20:28,175
and I learned to practice
a sort of immoral mathematics.

213
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,945

In the end I found I was able
to make them numbers add up.

Mmm.

218
00:20:57,365 --> 00:21:02,052
So, have you thought
about that confession?

219
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,948
Well, I figured by your math,

220
00:21:06,073 --> 00:21:08,225
you're gonna hang me either way.

221
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,644
Yeah.

finish eating your sorry ass?

were brutally slaughtered

then carried off into slavery
in their filthy camp...

the reader wants it to mean.

So, all you got to do is
get down on your knees...

get down on their knees

361
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,482
And that's exactly why
you need to hire me.

362
00:37:56,648 --> 00:37:59,903
You're going to have
to explain that to me.

363
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,833
I can't remember a time
I wasn't outgunned,

364
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:05,636
outmanned, or out supplied
fighting you Yankees.

365
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:08,995
But I damn sure whooped
your asses more often than not.

366
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,747
Is that so?

367
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:13,711
Yes, sir. My men rode to hell
and back for me, Mr. Durant.

368
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:17,337
That's why you need me out here.

369
00:38:18,941 --> 00:38:21,507
What do you know about
building railroads?

370
00:38:21,673 --> 00:38:22,988
Well, I had to learn
how they was built

371
00:38:23,113 --> 00:38:25,223
so I could figure out
bestow to blow them up.

372
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:26,857
You remember the Baltimore

373
00:38:26,982 --> 00:38:29,260
and Ohio bridge over
the monacacy river?

374
00:38:29,385 --> 00:38:31,559
I built that bridge before the war.

375
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,767
I blew the whole thing up

376
00:38:35,892 --> 00:38:39,400
using half a keg of black powder...

377
00:38:39,566 --> 00:38:42,439
But I'm done
destroying things, Mr. Durant.

378
00:38:42,564 --> 00:38:45,240
I want to help you
build this railroad.

379
00:38:49,172 --> 00:38:53,581
Why should I trust
my railroad to a gray back?

380
00:38:55,478 --> 00:38:58,724
You didn't have too much trouble
trusting gray backs

381
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:02,461
when you was smuggling cotton out of
Mississippi during the war, now did ya?

382
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:04,300
You walk a fine line, son.

383
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:06,198
40 Miles, Mr. Durant.

384
00:39:06,323 --> 00:39:09,347
Ain't no secret you got to lay
40 Miles of usable track

385
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,803
before your government
money kicks in.

386
00:39:11,928 --> 00:39:14,372
Now, you and I both know

387
00:39:14,497 --> 00:39:17,272
that you ain't gonna get
there going at this rate.

388
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,900
You don't get that $16,000 a mile,

389
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:23,572
this whole thing goes belly-up.

390
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,449
You're fighting a war, Mr. Durant.

391
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:30,489
No doubt about it.

392
00:39:30,614 --> 00:39:34,122
You need me to help you win it.

393
00:39:48,568 --> 00:39:50,013
Son of a bitch.

394
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,684
What the hell are you doing, man?

395
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,477
He's the son of a bitch
who killed Johnson.

396
00:39:56,643 --> 00:39:57,686
We gonna hang him.

397
00:39:57,811 --> 00:39:59,314
Nonsense.

398
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:01,899
This is my new foreman.

399
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,820
Find me someone else to hang.

400
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:45,651
You're the new foreman?

401
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:47,653
Yeah.

402
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,868
Johnson's things still in there?

403
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,142
Yes, sir.

404
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:56,704
You want me to clear it out?

405
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,164
Leave it.

406
00:40:59,705 --> 00:41:01,472
Yes, sir.

407
00:42:03,502 --> 00:42:10,695
