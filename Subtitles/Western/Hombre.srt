that Mr. Russell died
three nights ago.

Why?

55
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:21,183

has given you.

178
00:17:03,414 --> 00:17:05,780
The lovemaking's fine, isn't it?

179
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,283
No, it isn't fine!

180
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:11,220
It's mostly something you want to do
and usually without taking a shave.

181
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:13,723
Look. You don't want
to have any kids.

182
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,725
You don't want to
keep house.

183
00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:18,227
Now you don't want
to sleep with me.

184
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:21,231
I can do better to get
a dog to keep me company!

185
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:31,240
I'd like to see
these forks just once

186
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:34,244
without yesterday's
dried egg on them.

187
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:39,749
The walls
of this house

188
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:41,751
are paper thin,
Billy Lee.

189
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:43,753
What's that
supposed to mean?

190
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:46,756
It means you can hear
everything through them,

191
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:48,257
and I mean everything.

192
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:50,351
We fight a lot.

193
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:53,397
What's wrong
with you two?

194
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:55,762
Well, what isn't?

195
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:01,202
What did you
get married for?

196
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:06,710
So you'd have the right
to sleep in the same bed?

197
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:08,177
I guess.

198
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:12,706
Well, that part of it isn't
going to last, believe it or not.

199
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:15,116
She'll get fat,
and you'll get old.

200
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:16,619
Then what?

201
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:19,714
I'm not worried about then.
I'm worried about now.

202
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,225
You try living with
the 24-hour bellyaching

203
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:24,284
and see how you like it.

204
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:26,387
That's the price you pay
if you want it

205
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:28,398
where you can
nudge it in the night.

206
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:33,236
Billy,
time to go to work.

207
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:36,239
Well...

208
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:39,242
I see the silver's being
polished all nice and bright

209
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,470
for Mr. Russell.

210
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:42,638
And what's the matter
with that?

211
00:18:42,714 --> 00:18:46,650
And who are you going
to all this trouble for?

212
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:50,017
A man who was carried off by
the Apaches when he was a child,

213
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,489
raised among red devils
to be a red devil.

214
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:56,584
Is that what I'm gonna have sleeping
in the bed in my front bedroom?

215
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:59,255
I'll tell you
something else about him.

216
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,264
When old man Russell found him

217
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:03,266
amongst some army
prisoners at Fort Thomas

218
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:07,771
and took him to his home,
gave him his name,

219
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,205
this ingrate went back
to the Apache again.

220
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,210
He had no use
for the white man.

221
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:17,214
So... you don't waste
your time with this, hmm?

222
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,216
He eats with the fingers.

223
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,718
When I get done with him,

224
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,414
he'll be eating
out of my hand.

225
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:25,922
You think so?

226
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,184
Uh-huh.

227
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,243
Mr. Russell?

228
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,249
I'm Jessie Brown.
I've been expecting you.

229
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,754
The gate seems to be
off the hinge.

230
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,258
I know. I've been meaning to
do something about that

231
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,759
sometime or other.

232
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,261
Come on in.
We can't talk here.

233
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,267
[Door Squeaks]

234
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,271
I hear it.

235
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,776
The roof s got
a nice, big leak too.

236
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,777
If it were raining now,

237
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,279
you'd drown right where
you're standing.

238
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,782
But it isn't raining,
is it?

239
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,283
Doesn't appear to be.

240
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,785
[Squeak]

241
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,548
Mr. Russell,

242
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:33,988
this house has got ten rooms,
two flights of stairs,

243
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:36,856
and one woman to
keep it all nailed down.

244
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:37,860
That's me.

245
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:38,987
All right.

246
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:42,123
Would you like to see
the rest of the house?

247
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,634
There's nothing else
to show you

248
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,670
except me
and the account books,

249
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:50,333
and you've already had
a fairly critical look at me.

250
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:53,275
Well, I'll take
a look at the books.

251
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:58,080
You might like to know

252
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:00,583
that old man Russell
had a fine funeral.

253
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:02,516
Everyone in the house
chipped in.

254
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:05,021
We bought him a horseshoe
of red carnations.

255
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:07,023
They didn't last
in this heat,

256
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:08,524
but they
were pretty.

257
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:11,027
And we got him
a marble headstone.

258
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:13,529
It has his name on it,

259
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:15,532
and underneath
we had them put,

260
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,534
"In the fullness
of his years."

261
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:19,035
Is that all right?

262
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:21,367
I'd settle for that
on my own slab.

263
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,872
What do you figure
yours is gonna read?

264
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,204
"Shot dead," probably.

265
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:27,642
Don't people like you,
Mr. Russell?

266
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:29,577
Only takes
one who doesn't.

267
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:35,551
Let's assume you're
going to have a future.

268
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,214
How would you feel about
going into business with me?

269
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:42,385
I'll make the same arrangement with
you that I had with old man Russell.

270
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,054
These are the accounts.

271
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:47,063
You'll clear $300 a year

272
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:49,065
without even
lifting a finger...

273
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,569
and you'll have a place
to hang your hats, besides.

274
00:21:57,141 --> 00:22:00,076
I've had an offer
on this house...

275
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:03,011
for a herd of horses
down in Contention.

276
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:06,879
I think
I'm going to take it.

277
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:11,251
You knew that when
you walked in the door.

278
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:17,526
Let me ask you
something, lady.

279
00:22:17,595 --> 00:22:20,029
This house here that
you're so hot about,

280
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:21,530
it's mine, isn't it?

281
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,032
Yes, it's yours.

282
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,536
I can sell it or not sell it,
whichever, right?

283
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:29,539
You can do
what you want to.

284
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:31,541
Was there anything
in that will

285
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:33,304
that made provision
for you?

286
00:22:33,377 --> 00:22:35,242
Not a line.

287
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,543
Then it turns out
that I don't have

288
00:22:37,615 --> 00:22:40,049
any responsibility
toward you at all.

289
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:42,551
You don't owe me
a thing.

290
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,087
No. Fact is, I don't.

291
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:47,556
And I'm not one
to quarrel with the facts,

292
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,320
Mr. Russell.

293
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:57,066
[Door Opens]

294
00:22:58,369 --> 00:22:59,802
Anybody in there?

295
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:01,498
Just one.

296
00:23:01,572 --> 00:23:03,005
Got something to say,

297
00:23:03,074 --> 00:23:05,508
and I'd just as soon
nobody heard it.

298
00:23:05,576 --> 00:23:07,009
Why? Something wrong?

299
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:09,012
Russell is selling
the house.

300
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,014
I'm high and dry.

301
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:13,516
Well, now, that's
kind of sudden, ain't it?

302
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:15,518
It's his house
and my luck.

303
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:18,578
If you're hurting for money,
I can let you have a little.

304
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:20,647
You can let me have
more than that.

305
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:23,592
- Like what?
- Make an honest woman out of me.

306
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:25,526
Come on, Jess.
You're already that.

307
00:23:25,596 --> 00:23:28,030
Now, don't hedge.
I need an answer.

308
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:29,532
You appear to be it.

309
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,036
That's a hell of a romantic
way of looking at it.

310
00:23:33,104 --> 00:23:35,038
You could do a lot worse.

311
00:23:35,106 --> 00:23:37,540
I don't turn your pants
pockets inside out.

312
00:23:37,608 --> 00:23:40,873
I don't say no
in the middle of the night.

When you got the stomachache, I'm
ready with the bicarbonate of soda.

314

When you get a cold, I'm the one
who brings up the croup kettle.

315
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:51,153
I know I'm not 20,
but that's not too bad.

316
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:54,555
Over the years, I have learned
to control my temper.

317
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,650
All that's true.

318
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,628
So? Yes or no?

319
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,001
Not a chance.

Well...

I've gone this far.

322
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:13,010
So if it's not
too undignified to ask,

323
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,510
why not?

324
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,846
Jessie, you could be the Queen
of Sheba with a rose in your teeth,

00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:23,910
you could be Velvet-skin Annie
out of a Frisco hook shop,

00:24:23,988 --> 00:24:25,421
the answer
would still be "no."

You got me in pretty
classy company anyhow.

cleaning spittoons
at a dime a day.

00:24:32,463 --> 00:24:34,556
It's now 30 years later and
all I can see out the window

331
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:36,759
is a dirt road
going nowhere.

The only thing
that changes the view

333
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:42,197
is the spotted dog lifting his leg
against the wall over there.

and their rotgut liquor

of my one good shirt.

337
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:54,051
I wear three pounds of iron
strapped to my leg.

338
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,552
That makes me fair game
for any punk cowboy

339

340
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:01,489
No, Jess.
I don't need a wife.

00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:07,052
Doesn't seem to be
my day, does it?

I'm doing you
a favor, honey.

344
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,004
Anytime a man
weasels out on you,

345
00:25:15,072 --> 00:25:18,508
it turns out that
he's doing you a favor.

00:25:18,576 --> 00:25:21,511
Well, maybe you are, Frank.

It's urgent that my husband
and I get to Bisbee.

350
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:53,542
I want to arrange
to leave tonight.

351
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:56,546
- The line is closed.
- I'm prepared to hire a rig.

352
00:25:56,614 --> 00:25:57,911
We don't have any.

353
00:25:57,982 --> 00:25:59,347
What do you have?

354
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:00,782
Nothing at all, lady.

355
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:01,977
We got a mud wagon.

356
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:05,580
Who's going to drive it?

357
00:26:05,656 --> 00:26:07,180
I could do it.

358
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:08,691
He doesn't have
enough experience.

359
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,693
The company would
not allow it.

360
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:12,991
I'm willing
to let him drive.

361
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:15,498
You might also
be willing to sue us

362
00:26:15,566 --> 00:26:16,498
in case
something happens.

363
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:18,000
If I bought the wagon?

364
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:19,502
It's not mine to sell.

365
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:23,506
If I paid for more
than just our fares?

366
00:26:23,574 --> 00:26:26,008
Well, you'll need
a driver, horses...

367
00:26:26,077 --> 00:26:27,510
four, maybe six horses.

368
00:26:27,578 --> 00:26:30,012
And the relay stations
aren't working anymore.

369
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:33,482
The same horses
will have to go all the way.

370
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,520
If they don't make it,
who's going to pay for them?

371
00:26:36,587 --> 00:26:40,523
I'll buy the horses. So there's
no other problem, is there?

372
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:43,025
You want to get there
bad, don't you?

373
00:26:43,094 --> 00:26:44,186
Settle it.

374
00:26:44,261 --> 00:26:46,525
We'll go to the hotel
and have dinner.

375
00:26:46,597 --> 00:26:50,533
That should give you time
to find a man and get ready.

376
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:52,034
I don't know, lady.

377
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:54,537
You'll make a month's wages
in three days.

378
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:56,038
You'll be ready.

379
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:09,486
Me and Doris want to get
out of here, so does Jess.

380
00:27:09,553 --> 00:27:10,986
That's three more of us.

381
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:13,489
And Russell's looking
for a ride too.

382
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:14,990
All right,
that's four.

383
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:16,993
Why can't we do it?

384
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:18,494
Have I said we couldn't?

385
00:27:30,074 --> 00:27:32,590
Whoa!

386
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:39,590
Is everybody ready?

387
00:27:39,664 --> 00:27:42,030
I saw that fella Mendez.
I'm going along with you.

388
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:44,363
Going to Bisbee to get married.
What do you think?

389
00:27:44,435 --> 00:27:47,871
Not much, but that's up to you.
Here's your ticket.

390
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:50,874
If there are any stops open
on the way, show that for meals.

391
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:52,375
Drinks are extra.

392
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:54,877
Hand it in when you
reach your destination.

393
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:56,379
Hey, this one's for him.

394
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:58,381
Want to hand it to him?

395
00:27:58,449 --> 00:27:59,882
Sure.

396
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:07,323
I see you're
going to Contention.

397
00:28:07,391 --> 00:28:09,325
I change there for Bisbee.

398
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:12,658
Yesterday I was in the army, and
next week I'll be a mining man.

399
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,665
Week after, I'll have a wife
all arranged for and waiting.

400
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:17,928
Isn't that something?

401
00:28:18,002 --> 00:28:19,333
Yes, it is.

402
00:28:19,403 --> 00:28:21,769
What did you do
with my house plant?

403
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,171
I stuck it in the boot.
It's O.K.

404
00:28:24,242 --> 00:28:25,675
It better be.

405
00:28:25,743 --> 00:28:28,007
I nursed that thing along
for six years.

406
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,512
[Door Opens]

407
00:28:47,832 --> 00:28:50,357
- Cicero Grimes.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:28:50,434 --> 00:28:53,870
Well, write it down, boy,
for the coach out front.

409
00:28:53,938 --> 00:28:55,371
It's a special run.

410
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:58,636
I know that.
That's why I'm going on it.

411
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:00,643
I'm afraid
it's full-up.

412
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:03,305
You can get
one more on up top.

413
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:07,010
No one's allowed to ride with
the driver. That's a company rule.

414
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:11,946
They going?

415
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:14,321
Yes, sir. Both of them.

416
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:28,838
You got a ticket for
that stage out in front?

417
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:34,168
Well, that's it.

418
00:29:34,245 --> 00:29:36,770
You can give me your ticket,
and you can take the next stage.

419
00:29:36,847 --> 00:29:39,145
That's a funny idea.

420
00:29:39,216 --> 00:29:43,585
No, that's not a funny idea.
That's a good idea.

421
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:47,647
See, you could stay here,
get drunk, have some fun.

422
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:49,158
Now, how's that sound?

423
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:51,820
But I'm gonna be traveling tonight.
No. I don't think so.

424
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:55,696
Leave him alone! You come late,
you find your own way.

425
00:29:58,736 --> 00:30:00,169
What did you say?

426
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:01,670
I said why don't you
leave him alone?

427
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:04,708
The man wants to take
the stage, let him take it.

428
00:30:11,248 --> 00:30:14,183
Well, suppose I take
your ticket instead.

429
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:17,687
You just walk in and take
someone else's seat?

430
00:30:17,755 --> 00:30:20,189
Looks like it, don't it?

431
00:30:20,257 --> 00:30:23,192
Somebody's pulling
a joke on somebody.

432
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,353
You think so?

433
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:35,466
What kind of a business
do you run here?

434
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:37,473
You let a man walk in
and say he's taking your seat

435
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,031
after paying the fare?

436
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,340
The company doesn't
do anything about it?

437
00:30:41,412 --> 00:30:43,710
Friend.

438
00:30:45,282 --> 00:30:47,716
This business is
between you and me.

439
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:52,722
We don't want anybody else
poking their nose into it, do we?

440
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:55,088
You wearing a gun?

441
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:00,195
You better get one.

442
00:31:00,264 --> 00:31:03,165
You can't just threaten
a man like that.

443
00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:06,203
There are witnesses here
seeing you threaten me.

444
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,670
They heard you call me
a dirty name.

445
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:10,172
I never called you anything.

446
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:13,802
And even
if they didn't, I did.

447
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:17,244
I didn't say a word.

448
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:26,188
Now, friend...

449
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:29,192
I'm going to step out
into the street here,

450
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,855
and if you don't come out
in about one minute,

451
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:37,128
I'm going to have to
come back in here.

452
00:32:13,737 --> 00:32:15,432
You should have
done something.

453
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:19,402
You talking to me, lady?

454
00:32:19,477 --> 00:32:20,910
Yes, to you.

455
00:32:20,978 --> 00:32:22,673
It wasn't my business.

456
00:32:22,746 --> 00:32:24,611
What if he'd taken
your ticket?

457
00:32:24,682 --> 00:32:25,876
He didn't.

458
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:29,181
That soldier would have
helped you, and you know it.

459
00:32:29,253 --> 00:32:31,187
I didn't ask him for any.

460
00:32:31,255 --> 00:32:33,689
He didn't even
have a gun.

461
00:32:33,757 --> 00:32:36,885
That's his business,
he don't want to carry one.

462
00:32:39,263 --> 00:32:42,061
Takes a lot to light
a fire under you.

463
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:44,693
If it's all right
with you, lady,

464
00:32:44,768 --> 00:32:47,202
I just didn't feel
like bleeding for him.

465
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:50,206
And even if it isn't
all right with you.

466
00:33:24,775 --> 00:33:27,175
What if there were
Apaches out there now,

467
00:33:27,244 --> 00:33:28,711
watching us?

468
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:30,713
Don't alarm yourself,
young lady.

469
00:33:30,781 --> 00:33:32,214
The wild, free ones

470
00:33:32,283 --> 00:33:34,183
are all up in the mountains.

471
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:35,684
The wild, caught ones

472
00:33:35,753 --> 00:33:36,981
are at San Carlos.

473
00:33:37,054 --> 00:33:38,487
I've heard
a lot of stories

474
00:33:38,556 --> 00:33:41,150
about what Indians
do to white women.

475
00:33:41,225 --> 00:33:43,693
They do the same thing
to white women

476
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:45,194
they do to Indian women,

477
00:33:45,262 --> 00:33:48,959
and they don't mind it much,
red or white.

478
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:51,399
I don't know if the ladies
enjoy that kind of talk.

479
00:33:51,468 --> 00:33:53,732
What kind of talk?

480
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:56,432
About Apache Indians
and what they do to women.

481
00:33:58,776 --> 00:34:01,336
You saying
I got a loose mouth?

482
00:34:01,412 --> 00:34:03,539
If he wasn't
saying it, I am.

483
00:34:03,614 --> 00:34:07,015
Right. That lady
speaks right up, don't she?

484
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:08,210
Mm-hmm.

485
00:34:08,285 --> 00:34:12,085
If you want to know
if I'm carrying a gun, I'm not.

486
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:15,648
My tongue is my only
weapon, Mr. Grimes.

487
00:34:15,726 --> 00:34:17,091
And it's deadly.

488
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:29,105
I've lived among the Apaches
on a reservation...

489
00:34:29,173 --> 00:34:33,542
the women grinding corn
and rubbing skins,

490
00:34:33,611 --> 00:34:35,044
the men almost naked...

491
00:34:35,112 --> 00:34:36,670
some of them quite striking.

492
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:39,181
Just when you begin to
find them almost beautiful,

493
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,184
they squat
and pick at themselves

494
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:42,446
with the dogs

495
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,679
sniffing at them.

496
00:34:43,754 --> 00:34:46,222
I can't imagine
eating a dog

497
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,190
and not thinking
anything of it.

498
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:50,193
You ever been
hungry, lady?

499
00:34:50,261 --> 00:34:52,195
Not just ready for supper,

500
00:34:52,263 --> 00:34:56,290
but hungry enough
so that your belly swells up?

501
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:58,699
I wouldn't care
how hungry I got.

502
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,236
I know I wouldn't eat
one of those camp dogs.

503
00:35:00,304 --> 00:35:04,138
You'd eat it. You'd fight
for the bones too.

504
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,904
Have you ever
eaten a dog, Mr. Russell?

505
00:35:06,977 --> 00:35:09,241
Eaten one
and lived like one.

506
00:35:09,313 --> 00:35:11,975
Dear me.

507
00:35:17,221 --> 00:35:19,155
Mr. Russell
obviously feels sympathy

508
00:35:19,223 --> 00:35:21,157
for the Indians' plight.

509
00:35:21,225 --> 00:35:24,160
If you're a humane man,
you do.

510
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:28,426
But you have to live on
a reservation like San Carlos

511
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:29,989
to see that caring for them

512
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:32,331
is not a simple matter
of giving them food and clothing.

513
00:35:32,403 --> 00:35:34,667
My name is Favor,
by the way.

514
00:35:34,738 --> 00:35:37,468
I happen to be
the Indian agent at San Carlos.

515
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:40,476
As the agent,
I see all the problems

516
00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:42,307
the Interior Department
is faced with...

517
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:45,314
natural resentment
on the part of the Indians,

518
00:35:45,382 --> 00:35:46,679
their distrust,

519
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,684
their reluctance to
cultivate the soil.

520
00:35:48,752 --> 00:35:51,152
They live where
they don't want to live.

521
00:35:51,221 --> 00:35:55,681
That too, which can't
be helped for the time being.

522
00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:59,251
Do you happen to know
someone at San Carlos?

523
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,628
Most of them.

524
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:06,295
- You've visited the agency?
- I lived there.

525
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,804
I don't think
I recognize you.

526
00:36:08,872 --> 00:36:10,806
Did you work for
one of the suppliers?

527
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:13,308
No. I worked
for the police.

528
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:16,612
But the police
are all Apache.

529
00:36:37,234 --> 00:36:38,667
Whoa.

530
00:36:40,037 --> 00:36:42,335
Delgado's station.

531
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:45,933
- Mendez!
- Well, who else?

532
00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:48,842
You can wash at the bench
near the kitchen door

533
00:36:48,912 --> 00:36:52,780
and follow the path around the back
for the other things.

534
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,511
- Still got horses?
- A few more days.

535
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:56,246
Then change them for these.

536
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,788
I thought you had closed down.

537
00:36:58,856 --> 00:37:00,380
That's a long story.

538
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:02,948
Get your woman
to make some coffee, eh?

539
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:10,029
Mr. Mendez.

540
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,625
I find myself
in an awkward situation.

541
00:37:12,703 --> 00:37:15,638
I'm going to have
to rely on your tact.

542
00:37:15,706 --> 00:37:18,470
You mean you have
a dirty job for me to do.

543
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:20,510
Giving as little
offense as possible

544
00:37:20,577 --> 00:37:23,205
arrange to have Mr. Russell
ride on top with you.

545
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,341
How do I offend the man
without offending him, Dr. Favor?

546
00:37:27,418 --> 00:37:29,147
My wife finds it disturbing

547
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:31,153
having him inside with us.

548
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:34,657
What is there about him
that bothers the lady?

549
00:37:34,725 --> 00:37:37,717
I'm sure you know
his history better than I do.

550
00:37:37,795 --> 00:37:39,660
I leave it in your hands.

551
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,992
And wash yours?

552
00:38:20,204 --> 00:38:21,637
It's for the dust...

553
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:23,639
or whatever reason
you want.

554
00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:44,584
Dr. Favor... says you shouldn't
ride in the coach.

555
00:38:48,232 --> 00:38:49,665
They all say that?

556
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:52,167
I don't know
what they all say,

557
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:54,170
but he's paying
for most of it.

558
00:38:54,238 --> 00:38:55,671
I don't think
he wants to argue.

559
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:57,001
What do you say?

560
00:38:57,074 --> 00:39:02,102
Well, I say,
why make people unhappy?

561
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:04,613
Let them do
what they want.

562
00:39:04,681 --> 00:39:06,478
It's not a big thing.
Why should we let it worry us?

563
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,110
What if I decide
to stay inside?

564
00:39:09,186 --> 00:39:13,623
A man could catch his death
of cold riding up on top.

565
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,783
Is that worth
arguing about,

566
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:18,123
making trouble, getting
people angry and upset?

567
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:20,356
Or is it easier
to forget it? Which?

568
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:28,600
If you ask...

569
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:32,233
why I lend myself
to this...

570
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,243
it's a habit...

571
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:37,473
a lifetime of it.

572
00:39:37,548 --> 00:39:39,948
I didn't ask.

573
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:42,943
Against the cold.

574
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,460
I want you
to hear this.

575
00:39:55,532 --> 00:39:57,500
I was just telling him

576
00:39:57,568 --> 00:40:00,332
that you're not the first
through here this afternoon.

577
00:40:00,404 --> 00:40:02,167
About an hour ago,
three men came by.

578
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,434
- Did you know them?
- Some riders.

579
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:06,476
- But did you know them?
- They may work around here.

580
00:40:06,543 --> 00:40:08,477
This station's
supposed to be closed.

581
00:40:08,545 --> 00:40:09,978
What were they
doing here?

582
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:12,140
It happens.
People pass by.

583
00:40:12,215 --> 00:40:14,979
What did they look like? Did they
say where they were going?

584
00:40:15,052 --> 00:40:17,043
If you think they
planned to hold us up,

585
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,487
they wouldn't know
a stage was coming by today.

586
00:40:20,557 --> 00:40:23,492
I want to go another way.
Is there one?

587
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,495
There's a road past
the old San Pete Mine.

588
00:40:26,563 --> 00:40:28,497
It hasn't been used in years.

589
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:31,864
It's wild and hard to travel over,
but it ends up in the same place.

590
00:40:31,935 --> 00:40:34,426
We'll take it.
We have women.

591
00:40:34,504 --> 00:40:38,338
Any possibility of being stopped,
we should take precautions.

592
00:40:38,408 --> 00:40:40,501
Start without delay,
if you please.

593
00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:46,010
Hyah!

594
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:49,519
Get up! Get up!

595
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:51,019
Hyah!

596
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:54,022
Hyah!

597
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:20,443
Smoke bother you?

598
00:41:22,422 --> 00:41:25,858
Would you put it out
if I said it did?

599
00:41:28,428 --> 00:41:30,089
Oh, yeah.

600
00:41:30,163 --> 00:41:34,361
My mama taught me
to remove my hat and my cigar

601
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:36,868
in the presence
of a lady.

602
00:41:36,937 --> 00:41:38,370
Whatever else I take off

603
00:41:38,438 --> 00:41:40,463
depends on
how lucky I get.

604
00:41:54,955 --> 00:41:57,549
Oh, it's stuffy in there.

605
00:41:57,624 --> 00:41:59,387
I noticed.

606
00:41:59,459 --> 00:42:03,327
Listen, I had nothing to do
with your getting thrown out.

607
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:04,830
All right.

608
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:07,332
Although, frankly,
it wouldn't bother me a bit

609
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:10,336
if you had to walk
all the way to Bisbee.

610
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:12,463
It wouldn't bother
me either, lady.

611
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,349
Get up there!

612
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,354
Get up now!

613
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,356
Get up! Get up!

614
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:32,358
Giddup! Yes!

615
00:42:32,426 --> 00:42:34,360
Giddup!

616
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,041
Ho!

617
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:02,987
All right,
everybody out!

618
00:43:05,058 --> 00:43:07,492
Billy, take care
of the horses

619
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:09,495
and get a water bag.

620
00:43:09,563 --> 00:43:11,497
Why have we made this stop?

621
00:43:11,565 --> 00:43:13,999
If you're thinking of us,
we're not tired.

622
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:16,501
No. I'm thinking
of the horses... and me.

623
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,003
I'm tired.

624
00:43:18,071 --> 00:43:20,301
We'll rest here
for a couple of hours.

625
00:43:20,374 --> 00:43:22,501
I have to get some sleep.

626
00:43:22,576 --> 00:43:25,010
If you're smart,
you'll do the same.

627
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:35,520
Hey, amigo.

628
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:40,525
This ain't the stage road.

629
00:43:40,594 --> 00:43:43,028
We took a different way.

630
00:43:43,096 --> 00:43:44,529
Different way?

631
00:43:44,598 --> 00:43:48,034
You just take any old road
you feel like?

632
00:43:48,101 --> 00:43:51,036
I think you'd better
talk to Dr. Favor.

633
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:53,038
No.
I'm talking to you.

634
00:43:57,611 --> 00:43:59,272
We all agreed.

635
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:01,473
You were asleep.

636
00:44:01,548 --> 00:44:05,450
I thought... he wants
to come with us so bad,

637
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,453
this will be all right.

638
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:08,749
Where's it go?

639
00:44:08,822 --> 00:44:10,289
Same place.

640
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:14,293
We'll be in Benson tomorrow
if the road is all right

641
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:15,794
and nothing happens.

642
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,295
What could happen?

643
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,825
You better stop
right there, lady,

644
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:57,330
or I'm going to know
all there is to know about you.

645
00:45:57,397 --> 00:46:00,161
Well, you could at least
have cleared your throat.

646
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:03,464
I couldn't.
My heart was in it.

647
00:46:03,537 --> 00:46:06,768
It's hot.
These are heavy.

648
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:10,275
So you've seen my legs.

649
00:46:10,343 --> 00:46:12,903
There are worse
walking around.

650
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,641
Some worse,
some better.

651
00:46:15,715 --> 00:46:19,776
Well, you're not going to
have much to do with them,

652
00:46:19,853 --> 00:46:21,787
so don't
let it worry you.

653
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:23,789
You're a pretty
thorny woman.

654
00:46:23,857 --> 00:46:26,291
Has anyone ever gotten
within range of you?

655
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:28,793
Not that it's
any of your business,

656
00:46:28,862 --> 00:46:30,796
but I was married once.

657
00:46:30,864 --> 00:46:34,300
Been a widow
since I was 19.

658
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:38,804
My husband was
a sweet Missouri boy.

659
00:46:38,872 --> 00:46:42,308
One night, they brought him home
on a kitchen door.

660
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:44,309
Been shot eight times.

661
00:46:44,377 --> 00:46:46,311
Seems there
had been an argument

662
00:46:46,379 --> 00:46:49,314
over the price
of a Mexican saddle.

663
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:53,284
He had a comic valentine
for me in his pocket.

664
00:46:53,353 --> 00:46:56,652
The dead are dead.
You ought to bury them.

665
00:46:58,391 --> 00:47:00,325
I'm sure
that's good advice.

666
00:47:00,393 --> 00:47:03,760
Trouble is, Mr. Russell,

667
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:08,267
I think you feel the same way
about the living.

668
00:47:27,821 --> 00:47:29,789
What do you want?

669
00:47:29,856 --> 00:47:32,290
I hope I'm not
bothering you,

670
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:34,691
but it's so hot,
I was just cooking.

671
00:47:36,263 --> 00:47:39,289
Whew. There's a nice little
breeze up here, though,

672
00:47:39,366 --> 00:47:41,129
isn't there?

673
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:43,761
Everybody's
gone to sleep.

674
00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:46,305
I can't sleep
when it gets this hot.

675
00:47:46,373 --> 00:47:47,704
I just wake up dizzy.

676
00:47:47,774 --> 00:47:50,299
That a fact?

677
00:47:53,713 --> 00:47:55,647
This place
sure is spooky,

678
00:47:55,715 --> 00:47:58,650
all those buildings
and nobody in them.

679
00:48:01,288 --> 00:48:04,780
You know, I'm awfully glad
you're along with us.

680
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:06,485
If anything happened,

681
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,993
it's nice to know
there's somebody along

682
00:48:09,062 --> 00:48:10,859
that could do
something about it.

683
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,296
That's what you think?

684
00:48:12,365 --> 00:48:15,027
I saw you back
at the station.

685
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:18,537
You frightened the life
out of everyone back there.

686
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:21,039
Did you like that,
little lady?

687
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:23,337
I like to see a man
act like a man.

688
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:27,039
I think that you should
have what you like.

689
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,274
Oh! Don't do this!

690
00:48:30,951 --> 00:48:32,543
You scared?

691
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:35,053
You never had it
like this, hmm?

692
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,555
You get hurt a little,
and then you...

693
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:42,561
get rubbed a little bit.

694
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:50,068
Ha ha ha!

695
00:48:51,771 --> 00:48:54,069
[Sobbing]

696
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:03,047
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm going to get my husband!

697
00:49:03,116 --> 00:49:05,243
So he can charge up that hill
and get his head blown off?

698
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:06,876
You let go of me!

699
00:49:06,953 --> 00:49:08,887
He's got to do something.
That man hurt me.

700
00:49:08,955 --> 00:49:12,721
You wagged your tail in his face to
get his attention, and you got it.

701
00:49:15,095 --> 00:49:17,529
You're disgusting,
you know that?

702
00:49:17,597 --> 00:49:20,225
You talk so dirty.

703
00:49:23,603 --> 00:49:26,538
Wipe your nose
and shut your mouth...

704
00:49:26,606 --> 00:49:28,039
and tell everyone

705
00:49:28,108 --> 00:49:30,042
you fell and skinned your knees

706
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:31,509
going to the public
convenience.

707
00:49:31,578 --> 00:49:33,546
Here. Mop up.

708
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:53,065
Hyah! Hyah!

709
00:49:54,634 --> 00:49:56,067
Hyah!

710
00:50:17,157 --> 00:50:21,093
We're missing a water bag.
We started with three.

711
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:24,096
I must have left it
behind at San Pete.

712
00:50:24,164 --> 00:50:25,597
Mendez will skin me.

713
00:50:25,665 --> 00:50:27,098
Right down
to the bone.

714
00:50:36,176 --> 00:50:38,610
[Doris Blake]
Oh, that's an awfully pretty kit.

715
00:50:38,678 --> 00:50:41,613
[Mrs. Favor]
Yes. It's made of Spanish leather.

716
00:50:41,681 --> 00:50:42,773
Geranium?

717
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:44,248
Jasmine.
Would you like some?

718
00:50:44,317 --> 00:50:45,614
It's cooling.

719
00:50:45,685 --> 00:50:49,121
Thank you. What does
a bottle like this cost?

720
00:50:49,189 --> 00:50:51,623
The best years
of your life.

721
00:50:51,691 --> 00:50:53,124
I like Dr. Favor.

722
00:50:53,193 --> 00:50:55,127
He has
such lovely manners.

723
00:50:55,195 --> 00:50:56,628
I was noticing his hands.

724
00:50:56,696 --> 00:50:59,130
He keeps his nails
so nice and clean.

725
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,100
He's very proud of his hands
and feet, they're so small.

726
00:51:02,168 --> 00:51:05,535
I, on the other hand, am proud
of his brain. It's very large.

727
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:06,936
He reads a lot, doesn't he?

728
00:51:07,006 --> 00:51:10,271
Far into the night,
which is just as well.

729
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:14,370
'Cause when he takes his trousers
off and folds them neatly

730
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:17,007
and hangs them over
the back of a chair,

731
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:21,577
that sharp, exciting intelligence
of his doesn't count for very much.

732
00:51:21,654 --> 00:51:24,088
All we're left with
is thin, spindly legs

733
00:51:24,157 --> 00:51:26,887
with those
little blue veins on them

734
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,394
and all the knots
and bumps.

735
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:31,589
A love match, huh?

736
00:51:31,664 --> 00:51:34,098
When I was 18
and a student of his

737
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:36,727
and I heard him read
Robert Browning.

738
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:41,604
But now I'm 35,
and I hear him cough up phlegm.

739
00:51:41,674 --> 00:51:43,608
They all make
those noises...

740
00:51:43,676 --> 00:51:46,110
bathroom noises
and bedroom noises.

741
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:49,615
Well, I suppose we've
all felt the same chill.

742
00:51:49,682 --> 00:51:51,616
Not me. I like men.

743
00:51:51,684 --> 00:51:55,120
They may have put
a little gray in my hair,

744
00:51:55,188 --> 00:51:57,622
but I keep coming
back for more,

745
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,624
so they must have
something.

746
00:51:59,692 --> 00:52:01,091
[Russell]
Hear, hear.

747
00:52:09,135 --> 00:52:11,069
[Mendez Barking Orders
At Horses]

748
00:52:34,661 --> 00:52:36,094
Whoa!

749
00:52:37,664 --> 00:52:41,725
Everybody take a nice walk
to the top of the grade.

750
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:56,114
Hyah!

751
00:53:27,647 --> 00:53:31,083
Well, I'm getting tired
of this trip.

752
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:32,583
I want a bath.

753
00:53:32,652 --> 00:53:35,086
I want to sleep
12 hours.

754
00:53:35,154 --> 00:53:38,089
I want a big, rare steak.

755
00:53:39,659 --> 00:53:41,092
And then what?

756
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,095
I don't know.
I never know what's next.

757
00:53:44,163 --> 00:53:48,099
Whatever it is, I'm going
to have to scratch for it.

758
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:49,600
That I do know.

759
00:53:49,669 --> 00:53:53,503
Wish I could find a rich old man
and give it a rest for a while.

760
00:53:53,573 --> 00:53:57,600
- Where? Out to pasture?
- Mm-hmm. I'm ready.

761
00:53:57,677 --> 00:54:01,113
Let someone else
work up a sweat for a change.

762
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:04,547
Let someone else
put the meat on the table.

763
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:08,045
Glad to buy you dinner.

764
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:10,055
Mmm. There's
a lot of men

765
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:12,557
who will do that,
Mr. Russell.

766
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:15,560
Well, I'd just as soon
make it breakfast.

767
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:17,061
No, thanks.

768
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:21,066
I just take coffee in the morning...
nothing with it.

769
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:43,588
You know, we liked
not to have made it.

770
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,090
I figured you had
some catching up to do.

771
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:48,593
When you didn't come
by the main road,

772
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:50,094
we went back
to Delgado's.

773
00:54:50,163 --> 00:54:52,097
He told us you'd
come this other way.

774
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:54,656
He didn't want
to tell us, but he told.

775
00:54:54,734 --> 00:54:57,100
I tell you,
we done some riding.

776
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,070
Well, look who
we have here.

777
00:54:59,138 --> 00:55:01,629
Hello, Jessie.

778
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:03,869
Feeling ornery,
Frank?

779
00:55:03,943 --> 00:55:06,411
Let's not start
asking questions.

780
00:55:06,479 --> 00:55:09,971
Just one...
what are you doing here?

781
00:55:10,049 --> 00:55:12,176
Going bad, honey.

782
00:55:12,251 --> 00:55:15,448
All right.
Break out that luggage.

783
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:18,046
Doc Favor's pretending
he don't see us.

784
00:55:18,124 --> 00:55:20,558
Things kind of
close in on you,

785
00:55:20,626 --> 00:55:22,560
don't they, Doctor?

786
00:55:22,628 --> 00:55:25,563
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

787
00:55:25,631 --> 00:55:28,065
My wife and I
are going to Bisbee

788
00:55:28,134 --> 00:55:29,567
to settle some affairs.

789
00:55:29,635 --> 00:55:31,466
We'll be there
two days at most.

790
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,562
That's not where
you're going.

791
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:36,972
You're going to
hole up in Mexico,

792
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:40,069
or you're going
to get on a boat in Veracruz

793
00:55:40,146 --> 00:55:41,272
and head out.

794
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:43,281
Hey, Lamar,
you know something.

795
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:46,079
He ought to be
over here with a gun.

796
00:55:46,152 --> 00:55:49,588
He don't need a gun
to pull off a robbery.

797
00:55:49,655 --> 00:55:51,646
He does it
with pen and ink.

798
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:54,591
- No.
- Yeah.

799
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,118
He just claims a higher
beef tally than what comes in.

800
00:55:58,197 --> 00:56:02,031
Then he pays the trail driver off
for what's delivered,

801
00:56:02,101 --> 00:56:05,764
charges the government for meat
that ain't even there,

802
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:07,863
and then pockets
the difference.

803
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,373
Ain't that right, Doctor?

804
00:56:09,442 --> 00:56:11,774
The Indians go hungry,
but you don't.

805
00:56:11,844 --> 00:56:15,541
All right.
Let's get to it.

806
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:38,069
What about
up in the boot?

807
00:56:38,137 --> 00:56:39,570
A shotgun.

808
00:56:41,641 --> 00:56:44,075
Do you think this
is worth your while?

809
00:56:44,143 --> 00:56:47,196
You won't be able to
show your face again.

810
00:56:48,263 --> 00:56:49,958
I purely appreciate that,

811
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:55,629
but don't give me
no more advice, please.

812
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,899
I'll bet you're dead
or arrested in two weeks.

813
00:56:57,973 --> 00:57:00,066
You ain't gonna have
nothing to bet with.

814
00:57:00,142 --> 00:57:03,305
- There are witnesses.
- I don't see no witnesses.

815
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:05,313
Lamar, you see
any witnesses?

816
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:06,973
No. Not here.

817
00:57:10,386 --> 00:57:13,822
That man don't look
like no witness.

818
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,754
Hey, mister!

819
00:57:15,824 --> 00:57:18,315
Are you a witness?

820
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:24,263
I've seen you someplace.

821
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:27,968
That bothers me.

822
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:31,202
Come on, mister.

823
00:57:31,273 --> 00:57:33,503
Help me out.
Where was it?

824
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,837
Cicero!

825
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:38,345
Well, now,
lookee here.

826
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:40,348
How much did you steal?

827
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:42,350
Tell us so we don't
have to count it.

828
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:44,249
He figures he's helped enough
without giving us the tally.

829
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,254
- About 12,000, I figure.
- Somewhere around there.

830
00:57:47,322 --> 00:57:48,289
Get it loaded.

831
00:57:48,357 --> 00:57:50,382
Looks like you did good,
and we did better.

832
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:52,927
Boy, get up there.
Throw those two saddles down.

833
00:57:52,995 --> 00:57:57,295
Amigo, you and you,
saddle them two horses.

834
00:58:05,374 --> 00:58:08,810
I figured you'd
ride along with us a way.

835
00:58:10,379 --> 00:58:12,313
I'd better not.

836
00:58:12,381 --> 00:58:14,315
You'll be all right.

837
00:58:14,383 --> 00:58:17,318
I'll be all right here.

838
00:58:19,388 --> 00:58:20,980
You're coming.

839
00:58:21,056 --> 00:58:24,025
One way or the other,
you're coming.

840
00:58:50,352 --> 00:58:52,786
Friend, I'll thank you
for the buggy ride,

841
00:58:52,855 --> 00:58:55,221
and we'll do it again
some time.

842
00:59:05,868 --> 00:59:08,302
Hyah! Hyah!

843
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:09,860
Hyah!

844
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,144
[Closes Shotgun]

845
00:59:25,888 --> 00:59:28,618
Kid, get down.

846
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,816
What?

847
00:59:29,892 --> 00:59:31,826
Just get down
from there.

848
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,731
Hey, Braden.

849
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:41,325
Hold up a minute.

850
00:59:41,403 --> 00:59:43,337
I forgot
a little something.

851
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:48,775
What are you
doing up there?

852
00:59:48,844 --> 00:59:50,277
Getting my things.

853
00:59:50,345 --> 00:59:52,279
You figure
you're going someplace?

854
00:59:52,347 --> 00:59:54,281
Why stay here?

855
00:59:54,349 --> 00:59:55,782
Just how far

856
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:58,513
do you think
you're going to get?

857
00:59:58,587 --> 01:00:00,612
That's to find out.

858
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:11,856
Now, how far did you say
you're going to get?

859
01:00:11,934 --> 01:00:14,164
Leave us some water!

860
01:00:25,047 --> 01:00:26,878
Now how far?

861
01:00:38,393 --> 01:00:41,294
Oh, about as far
as Delgado's.

862
01:00:45,901 --> 01:00:47,596
What does that mean?

863
01:00:47,669 --> 01:00:49,762
Maybe if
we all get thirsty,

864
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:52,773
we'll go to Delgado's
and get some mescal.

865
01:01:31,413 --> 01:01:34,814
Jessie, do you want me
to do something about Braden?

866
01:01:36,385 --> 01:01:38,785
There's nothing
to be done about him.

867
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:55,496
Russell!

868
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:00,107
Russell,
where are you going?

869
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,273
Russell!
Wait for us!

870
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:04,778
Russell!

871
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,939
Russell, wait!

872
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,501
[Coughing]

873
01:03:15,851 --> 01:03:17,944
Why didn't you
wait for us?

874
01:03:18,019 --> 01:03:20,647
What did you want me
to wait for?

875
01:03:20,722 --> 01:03:23,316
Look, we want to
get out of here

876
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,655
before they come after us.

877
01:03:27,395 --> 01:03:28,987
Is there something
stopping you?

878
01:03:29,064 --> 01:03:31,999
Man, what is
the matter with you?

879
01:03:32,067 --> 01:03:34,535
This isn't happening to one person.
It's happening to everyone.

880
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:36,833
And you want me
to show you the way?

881
01:03:36,905 --> 01:03:40,864
Sure.
You show us the way, we follow,

882
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,173
but we are
all together.

883
01:03:44,246 --> 01:03:45,338
Together, huh?

884
01:03:45,413 --> 01:03:49,281
I flatter myself
that I understand Mr. Russell.

885
01:03:49,351 --> 01:03:51,285
We affronted his dignity...

886
01:03:51,353 --> 01:03:54,322
a very necessary thing
to a man.

887
01:03:54,389 --> 01:03:57,290
We asked him
not to ride with us.

888
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,020
Now he's telling us
we can't walk with him.

889
01:03:59,094 --> 01:04:00,493
Isn't that right, Mr. Russell?

890
01:04:00,562 --> 01:04:03,588
Maybe we don't walk
the way you walk.

891
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:06,327
Fair, but harsh.

892
01:04:06,401 --> 01:04:09,802
But for all that, you're no longer
in a hurry, are you?

893
01:04:09,871 --> 01:04:11,304
No. I'm in no hurry.

894
01:04:11,373 --> 01:04:13,807
If you want
to go on, go on.

895
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,399
Leave the saddlebags
and the gun.

896
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:17,809
I thought
we'd get to that.

897
01:04:17,879 --> 01:04:19,813
You forgot something,
didn't you?

898
01:04:19,881 --> 01:04:21,109
Money.

899
01:04:21,183 --> 01:04:24,812
An odd oversight for a man
who thinks of everything.

900
01:04:24,886 --> 01:04:27,354
I was a little busy
back there.

901
01:04:27,422 --> 01:04:29,856
He's thinking, "Why not
take my money out here?"

902
01:04:29,925 --> 01:04:31,517
No law to stop him.

903
01:04:31,593 --> 01:04:34,027
Your money?

904
01:04:34,095 --> 01:04:38,293
You starved a bunch of Indians to
death at San Carlos for that money,

905
01:04:38,366 --> 01:04:40,334
and now you're trying to get
your sticky fingers on it,

906
01:04:40,402 --> 01:04:42,461
and meanwhile Grimes is
getting the time he needs.

907
01:04:42,537 --> 01:04:45,506
Enough of this.
We have to move.

908
01:04:45,574 --> 01:04:47,269
Why move?

909
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:49,776
Why not wait here for him,

910
01:04:49,845 --> 01:04:51,506
maybe finish it?

911
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:52,774
Finish it?

912
01:04:52,848 --> 01:04:54,679
You mean kill him?

913
01:04:54,749 --> 01:04:56,910
They get close enough,
they're gonna kill you.

914
01:04:56,985 --> 01:05:00,148
They didn't hurt anybody before.
Why would they wanna hurt us now?

915
01:05:00,222 --> 01:05:02,782
They'll be running out of water.
You wanna give them yours?

916
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:04,792
- No.
- They'll kill you for it.

917
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,795
And if we don't
finish it, what then?

918
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:10,297
You got
no say in this.

919
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:13,300
Now, you can go on
or stay, whichever.

920
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:16,565
Either way, you leave the saddlebags
here. The belly gun too.

921
01:05:16,638 --> 01:05:20,472
You're not a figure to command
too much confidence, Mr. Russell.

922
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,874
What if everyone
decides against you?

923
01:05:22,944 --> 01:05:25,913
Then they've got you
to show them the way home.

924
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:36,323
It's the frying pan
or the fire,

925
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:37,824
as far as I'm concerned.

926
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:39,986
At least Russell
knows the way.

927
01:05:56,011 --> 01:05:57,979
All right.
Everybody, stay put.

928
01:06:04,853 --> 01:06:07,788
You got one thing
to do, kid...

929
01:06:07,856 --> 01:06:08,948
watch him.

930
01:06:09,024 --> 01:06:11,288
He can leave until
the time they come.

931
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:12,849
After that, no.

932
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:15,795
If he tries to leave
with nothing,

933
01:06:15,864 --> 01:06:17,297
shoot him once.

934
01:06:17,365 --> 01:06:20,300
If he takes the money,
shoot him twice.

935
01:06:20,368 --> 01:06:23,565
If he picks up the water,
you empty your gun. Understand?

936
01:06:23,638 --> 01:06:26,163
I don't understand
anything about this mess.

937
01:06:27,876 --> 01:06:30,310
Mendez, you think
you can do this?

938
01:06:33,381 --> 01:06:34,609
That's right.

939
01:06:48,897 --> 01:06:49,989
Right there.

940
01:06:56,404 --> 01:06:59,339
First, a shotgun
when they're close...

941
01:06:59,407 --> 01:07:02,843
and I mean so close
you can touch them...

942
01:07:02,911 --> 01:07:05,345
and then this
if you need it.

943
01:07:05,413 --> 01:07:06,846
I'll be over there.

944
01:07:06,915 --> 01:07:07,847
Where?

945
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:09,008
Right there.

946
01:07:09,084 --> 01:07:12,019
If one of us
doesn't get a good shot,

947
01:07:12,087 --> 01:07:13,611
the other
probably will.

948
01:07:13,688 --> 01:07:15,588
Hit something, Mendez...

949
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:19,093
first the men,
then the horses.

950
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,593
I don't know.

951
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:24,063
Just to sit here
and wait to kill them?

952
01:07:24,132 --> 01:07:26,100
If there was some
other way, we'd do it.

953
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:29,193
Maybe we can
outrun them.

954
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:34,071
If you run, they're going to catch
you. They're going to kill you.

955
01:07:34,142 --> 01:07:37,111
You believe that
more than you believe anything.

956
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,372
All right.

957
01:07:38,446 --> 01:07:40,107
And try not to puke.

958
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:44,117
You may have to lay
in it for a long time.

959
01:11:00,615 --> 01:11:02,981
[Whinnying]

960
01:12:32,107 --> 01:12:33,631
[Moaning]

961
01:12:44,052 --> 01:12:47,215
Hey, hombre!

962
01:12:47,288 --> 01:12:49,051
[Chuckling]

963
01:12:49,124 --> 01:12:51,922
A compliment
on your shooting.

964
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:57,362
You have put a hole in me.

965
01:12:57,432 --> 01:13:01,926
Whew! I never had
a bellyache like this

966
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:04,301
since I'm a little boy.

967
01:13:06,074 --> 01:13:08,099
Hey, amigo!

968
01:13:09,744 --> 01:13:11,439
Friend!

969
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:15,449
I am going to
give you back this bullet.

970
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,462
Tonight, Mendez,
not while the sun is out.

971
01:13:29,531 --> 01:13:30,623
Why not?

972
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:33,462
Because you sweat a lot
and you'll want more.

973
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,201
Hey, hombre!

974
01:13:58,993 --> 01:14:03,259
Look, amigo,
how close you come.

975
01:14:03,331 --> 01:14:06,926
I tried to do better.
I think you moved.

976
01:14:07,001 --> 01:14:09,663
You can be sure I move.

977
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:13,173
How do you prefer them...
tied to a tree?

978
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:14,674
That would be nice.

979
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:17,370
You like to
pull a trigger, huh?

980
01:14:17,445 --> 01:14:20,073
I can do it again for you.

981
01:14:20,148 --> 01:14:21,672
You could,

982
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:25,845
but first I have to talk
to this other...

983
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,182
this Favor.

984
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:29,519
He can hear you.

985
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:31,183
Tell him this...

986
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:34,023
Tell him
he give us the money

987
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:35,619
and some of the water,

988
01:14:35,697 --> 01:14:38,188
and we give him
his wife,

989
01:14:38,266 --> 01:14:39,756
and everybody goes home.

990
01:14:39,834 --> 01:14:42,530
Ask him
how he like that.

991
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:44,595
You out of water, huh?

992
01:14:44,672 --> 01:14:49,632
Ah, this Grimes,
he never bring canteen,

993
01:14:49,711 --> 01:14:51,144
only whiskey.

994
01:14:51,212 --> 01:14:54,648
He think it is
going to be easy.

995
01:14:54,716 --> 01:14:57,651
It's going to get harder.

996
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:00,654
Not if this Favor
give us the money.

997
01:15:00,722 --> 01:15:02,155
He hasn't got it.

998
01:15:02,223 --> 01:15:04,487
He gave it to me.

999
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:08,654
Ohh!

1000
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:11,528
Yousteal the money.

1001
01:15:11,599 --> 01:15:13,999
Ha ha ha!

1002
01:15:14,068 --> 01:15:17,663
All right.
We trade with you then.

1003
01:15:17,739 --> 01:15:19,673
You give us the money,

1004
01:15:19,741 --> 01:15:22,005
or we shoot the woman.

1005
01:15:22,076 --> 01:15:24,340
All right. Shoot her.

1006
01:15:26,748 --> 01:15:29,683
That nice
little soft woman?

1007
01:15:29,751 --> 01:15:32,413
You don't care
we shoot her?

1008
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:34,785
She's nothing to me.

1009
01:15:34,856 --> 01:15:38,348
How about the others?
What do they say?

1010
01:15:38,426 --> 01:15:42,419
They say what they want.
I say what I want.

1011
01:15:42,497 --> 01:15:44,965
Tell Grimes
how things are up here.

1012
01:15:45,033 --> 01:15:47,968
Tell him he'd better
think some more.

1013
01:15:50,705 --> 01:15:52,639
All right.

1014
01:15:52,707 --> 01:15:54,971
I talk with Grimes.

1015
01:15:56,711 --> 01:15:59,145
Ha ha ha ha!

1016
01:16:21,235 --> 01:16:22,668
Mr. Russell...

1017
01:16:22,737 --> 01:16:25,672
we're getting more and more
worried about you.

1018
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:28,675
If you can tell them
to shoot Mrs. Favor

1019
01:16:28,743 --> 01:16:30,301
without even flicking
an eyelash,

1020
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:33,506
we're beginning to wonder
how you feel about us.

1021
01:16:33,581 --> 01:16:35,173
You're a lot of trouble.

1022
01:16:36,751 --> 01:16:40,517
Then will you tell me why
we keep trotting after you?

1023
01:16:40,588 --> 01:16:42,249
Because I can cut it, lady.

1024
01:17:07,782 --> 01:17:09,716
[Billy Lee]
There's no more cover.

1025
01:17:09,784 --> 01:17:12,378
It's just open country.

1026
01:17:12,453 --> 01:17:14,387
[Favor]
If we cross in daylight,

1027
01:17:14,455 --> 01:17:16,855
they'll ride us down
with their horses.

1028
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:19,893
Then we leave
when it's dark.

1029
01:17:36,477 --> 01:17:38,741
Can we have
some water now?

1030
01:17:38,813 --> 01:17:39,905
Tonight.

1031
01:17:39,981 --> 01:17:42,040
Do you object
to our eating?

1032
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:44,084
The biscuits,
not the beef.

1033
01:17:44,152 --> 01:17:45,619
It's packed in salt.

1034
01:17:58,065 --> 01:18:01,364
I figure we'll reach San Pete
tomorrow morning,

1035
01:18:01,436 --> 01:18:04,371
Delgado's, if we're lucky,
the next morning.

1036
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:05,872
And then home.

1037
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:09,034
It doesn't seem so far
when you look ahead.

1038
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:12,375
The trouble is you have to
keep looking back.

1039
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:17,884
Don't let that
get away from you.

1040
01:18:17,952 --> 01:18:20,716
I'm going to go
have a look at things.

1041
01:18:50,918 --> 01:18:52,351
My friend.

1042
01:18:56,924 --> 01:19:00,860
I want you to know
you did very well back there.

1043
01:19:00,928 --> 01:19:03,692
It took more nerve
than most have

1044
01:19:03,764 --> 01:19:05,732
to lie there
waiting for them.

1045
01:19:07,435 --> 01:19:10,370
Well, he shouldn't have
made me do it.

1046
01:19:10,438 --> 01:19:14,499
You didn't have to,
you know.

1047
01:19:14,575 --> 01:19:16,839
Listen, he makes sense,
whether you agree with him or not.

1048
01:19:16,911 --> 01:19:21,371
He makes sense, even if it kills
you... that's what you're saying.

1049
01:19:21,449 --> 01:19:24,384
It's just I never
shot at a man before.

1050
01:19:24,452 --> 01:19:28,388
- That's not an easy thing.
- I know, but it seems easy to him.

1051
01:19:28,456 --> 01:19:31,550
If he can kill two people,
he can kill five.

1052
01:19:31,626 --> 01:19:33,560
- For what reason?
- My money.

1053
01:19:33,628 --> 01:19:37,462
No. I know him
better than that.

1054
01:19:37,532 --> 01:19:39,397
Where money
is concerned,

1055
01:19:39,467 --> 01:19:42,197
I'm afraid
you don't know anyone.

1056
01:19:50,912 --> 01:19:52,345
All right. Wake up.

1057
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:53,641
Wake up!

1058
01:19:53,714 --> 01:19:55,181
Come on. Wake up.

1059
01:19:57,151 --> 01:19:59,176
Get over there.

1060
01:20:06,928 --> 01:20:08,862
Throw me my gun,
please.

1061
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:15,368
The saddlebags
and the water.

1062
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:25,211
Maybe you'll leave us
your blessings

1063
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:27,042
since you're taking
everything else.

1064
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:31,210
[Russell] Do you think
you can carry all that?

1065
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:34,615
I think so.

1066
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:37,954
You better
put down that gun.

1067
01:20:41,062 --> 01:20:43,394
You got two ways to go...

1068
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:45,898
put it down or use it.

1069
01:20:49,704 --> 01:20:52,639
Even if you tie me,
you're going to be dead.

1070
01:20:55,409 --> 01:20:57,001
You've persuaded me.

1071
01:21:02,917 --> 01:21:04,509
Will that do?

1072
01:21:15,429 --> 01:21:18,330
If you wanted to go
someplace, keep going.

1073
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:21,368
I see. You're driving
me out, is that it?

1074
01:21:21,435 --> 01:21:22,868
Looks like it.

1075
01:21:22,937 --> 01:21:25,303
What am I permitted
to take with me,

1076
01:21:25,373 --> 01:21:26,863
if anything?

1077
01:21:26,941 --> 01:21:29,102
Your life. How's that?

1078
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:30,871
Not overly generous.

1079
01:21:30,945 --> 01:21:32,378
They're probably
out there

1080
01:21:32,446 --> 01:21:35,609
waiting for one of us
to show himself.

1081
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:37,514
You might make it.

1082
01:21:37,585 --> 01:21:40,884
If I don't,
it's the same as murder.

1083
01:21:40,955 --> 01:21:43,389
If you get there,
look me up.

1084
01:21:43,457 --> 01:21:45,186
We'll drink
on your luck.

1085
01:21:45,259 --> 01:21:48,319
If you get there.

1086
01:21:48,396 --> 01:21:49,829
Good-bye, my friends.

1087
01:21:49,897 --> 01:21:52,229
Take care
of yourselves.

1088
01:22:24,432 --> 01:22:26,866
Oh, it's getting cold.

1089
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:34,874
You haven't
moved a muscle

1090
01:22:34,942 --> 01:22:38,378
in the last
hour and a half.

1091
01:22:38,446 --> 01:22:41,882
You don't get tired.
You don't get hungry.

1092
01:22:41,949 --> 01:22:44,713
You don't
get thirsty.

1093
01:22:46,454 --> 01:22:47,978
Are you real?

1094
01:22:49,557 --> 01:22:51,320
More or less.

1095
01:22:52,893 --> 01:22:57,830
I've known a lot of men,
but I never met one like you.

1096
01:22:57,898 --> 01:22:59,331
There's always
been something

1097
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,028
that could rattle them
or shake them up a little.

1098
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,832
You, maybe?

1099
01:23:03,904 --> 01:23:06,668
I've done it to
a couple in my time.

1100
01:23:06,741 --> 01:23:08,208
Where are they now?

1101
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:12,003
Oh, they're all gone.

1102
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:19,352
I've been
wedded and bedded

1103
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:22,014
and loved and let down.

1104
01:23:23,924 --> 01:23:25,858
It hasn't always
been nice.

1105
01:23:25,926 --> 01:23:27,860
At least
it's been natural.

1106
01:23:27,928 --> 01:23:29,862
And you...

1107
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:33,366
do you toss a girl
over the back of your horse

1108
01:23:33,434 --> 01:23:36,130
and ride off
into the pinon trees?

1109
01:23:38,439 --> 01:23:40,566
You asking
for a demonstration?

1110
01:23:42,443 --> 01:23:44,206
I think I'm asking
for trouble.

1111
01:24:29,924 --> 01:24:31,858
[Two Gunshots]

1112
01:24:39,934 --> 01:24:41,367
What does that mean?

1113
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:45,364
I don't know.
A signal, maybe.

1114
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:46,872
Maybe they found Favor.

1115
01:24:46,941 --> 01:24:48,806
Yeah, maybe that, too.

1116
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:12,247
We'll hole up
in that shack on top

1117
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:13,748
while it's daylight

1118
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:15,751
and hope
they pass us by.

1119
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:17,252
Why stop now?

1120
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,754
If we keep going,
we get home.

1121
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:21,256
Oh, man,
we're so close.

1122
01:25:21,324 --> 01:25:22,757
So are they.

1123
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:45,110
There's blood
in my shoe.

1124
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:50,183
You always bought them
a size too small.

1125
01:26:28,992 --> 01:26:31,256
Dr. Favor!

1126
01:26:33,763 --> 01:26:35,993
It's Dr. Favor!

1127
01:26:57,053 --> 01:27:00,022
He doesn't remember
we left water behind.

1128
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,149
We have to tell him.

1129
01:27:02,225 --> 01:27:03,692
You don't do anything.

1130
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,524
What do you mean
we don't do anything?

1131
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:10,032
Take a look at him.
He's dying of thirst.

1132
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,034
What did you think
would happen?

1133
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:14,536
You just thought you'd
never see him again,

1134
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:17,038
so yesterday,
it was all right, huh?

1135
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:19,541
No. I should have
said something yesterday.

1136
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:21,042
I'm saying it now.

1137
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:22,339
Lady.

1138
01:27:22,412 --> 01:27:24,710
They could be
anywhere out there.

1139
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:26,214
Don't press our luck.

1140
01:27:31,855 --> 01:27:33,914
Dr. Favor!

1141
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:37,358
Dr. Favor!

1142
01:27:41,164 --> 01:27:43,997
We left water behind
in the mine shaft!

1143
01:27:46,836 --> 01:27:49,361
In the mine shaft!

1144
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:10,519
You will learn something
about white people...

1145
01:29:10,587 --> 01:29:13,055
they stick together.

1146
01:29:13,123 --> 01:29:15,353
They better.

1147

[Sigh]

1148
01:29:40,116 --> 01:29:43,051
Well, I reckon
I will just take me

1149
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:46,054
a little hike up that hill
and parley.

1150
01:29:46,122 --> 01:29:49,353
Any message you want
to send your husband?

1151
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:52,519
Tell him I'm being
well looked after.

1152
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:56,326
That's real wifely.

1153
01:29:59,602 --> 01:30:00,967
Hey!

1154
01:30:01,037 --> 01:30:03,369
I'm coming up to talk.

1155
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:05,703
Y'all hold your fire.

1156
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:21,056
Wait a minute. Wait!

1157
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:22,557
He wants to talk.

1158
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,559
That's no trick.

1159
01:30:24,627 --> 01:30:27,562
Let's hear
what he has to say.

1160
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,072
You don't know
what he wants.

1161
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,074
You have to find out
what he wants.

1162
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:43,738
- Doesn't that make sense to you?
- All right.

1163
01:30:52,589 --> 01:30:55,683
- Anybody home?
- We can hear you.

1164
01:30:55,758 --> 01:30:58,522
Come on out.
We'll talk some.

1165
01:30:58,595 --> 01:31:00,529
You say what you want.

1166
01:31:00,597 --> 01:31:03,464
How'd you like
to go home?

1167
01:31:05,435 --> 01:31:06,527
What else?

1168
01:31:06,603 --> 01:31:08,662
It's looking at you.

1169
01:31:08,738 --> 01:31:12,538
See, we can stay here
just as long as we please.

1170
01:31:12,609 --> 01:31:15,544
I can send a man
for more water and chuck,

1171
01:31:15,612 --> 01:31:17,546
but you people
can't move around.

1172
01:31:17,614 --> 01:31:21,050
You can't move
unless I let you, right?

1173
01:31:21,117 --> 01:31:22,812
What's your offer?

1174
01:31:22,886 --> 01:31:26,219
You leave the money,
we leave the woman.

1175
01:31:26,289 --> 01:31:28,621
We have to
talk about that.

1176
01:31:28,691 --> 01:31:30,056
You do that.

1177
01:31:30,126 --> 01:31:33,562
We'll let you look at the woman
while you're talking.

1178
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:35,063
That may help.

1179
01:31:35,131 --> 01:31:37,065
When you're ready,
bring the money down,

1180
01:31:37,133 --> 01:31:38,566
and you take her.

1181
01:31:38,635 --> 01:31:40,068
Suppose...

1182
01:31:40,136 --> 01:31:42,627
Well, suppose nobody
wants this woman.

1183
01:31:45,141 --> 01:31:46,574
That's all right,

1184
01:31:46,643 --> 01:31:49,510
but you ain't leavin' here
with the money,

1185
01:31:49,579 --> 01:31:52,514
and that's the main thing
you think about.

01:31:52,582 --> 01:31:56,018
- Hey. I got a question.
- What's that?

get down that hill?

Now, you hold on.

1189
01:32:01,591 --> 01:32:06,028
I'm going down this hill
the same way I come up it.

01:32:06,095 --> 01:32:08,325

Now, you just hold on.

01:35:48,918 --> 01:35:50,351
People kill each other, too.

1223
01:35:50,419 --> 01:35:51,852
I've seen that.

1224
01:35:51,921 --> 01:35:53,855
You're going
to see some more.

1225
01:35:53,923 --> 01:35:55,356
If you want to say

1226
01:35:55,424 --> 01:35:57,858
that it's my fault
we're stuck up here,

1227
01:35:57,927 --> 01:35:59,360
go ahead.

1228
01:35:59,428 --> 01:36:02,864
No. What I want to know
is why you helped.

1229
01:36:02,932 --> 01:36:04,365
Because he needed it,

1230
01:36:04,433 --> 01:36:06,867
just like that woman needs it.

1231
01:36:06,936 --> 01:36:09,370
It's not up to us to decide

1232
01:36:09,438 --> 01:36:11,998
whether she deserves
to live or not.

1233
01:36:12,074 --> 01:36:13,871
We only help, huh?

1234
01:36:13,943 --> 01:36:16,377
Do we have
another choice?

1235
01:36:16,445 --> 01:36:17,810
Not help.

1236
01:36:19,949 --> 01:36:21,644
Just let her die?

1237
01:36:21,717 --> 01:36:23,708
That's up to Grimes.

1238
01:36:25,955 --> 01:36:28,219
You mean,
you'd sacrifice her life

1239
01:36:28,291 --> 01:36:29,815
for that money?

1240
01:36:29,892 --> 01:36:31,382
Is that
what you're saying?

1241
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:32,893
You go down there,

1242
01:36:32,962 --> 01:36:36,398
and you ask that lady
what she thinks of life.

1243
01:36:36,465 --> 01:36:38,558
Ask her what life is worth
to those Indians in San Carlos

1244
01:36:38,634 --> 01:36:40,124
when they run out of meat.

1245
01:36:40,203 --> 01:36:43,036
But she didn't
take the money. Favor did.

1246
01:36:43,105 --> 01:36:46,905
She said, "Those
dirty Indians eat dog,"

1247
01:36:46,976 --> 01:36:48,910
that she couldn't eat dog
no matter how hungry she got.

1248
01:36:48,978 --> 01:36:50,843
Ask her if she'd eat dog now.

1249
01:36:50,913 --> 01:36:54,405
I don't know what your gripe is
against the world.

1250
01:36:54,483 --> 01:36:56,917
Maybe you got a real one.

1251
01:36:56,986 --> 01:36:58,920
Lady, up there
in those mountains,

1252
01:36:58,988 --> 01:37:01,923
there's a whole people
who have lost everything.

1253
01:37:01,991 --> 01:37:05,927
They don't have a place left
to spread their blankets.

1254
01:37:05,995 --> 01:37:09,431
They've been
insulted, diseased,

1255
01:37:09,498 --> 01:37:11,762
made drunk and foolish.

1256
01:37:11,834 --> 01:37:15,702
Now, you call the men who did that
Christians, and you trust them.

1257
01:37:15,771 --> 01:37:18,934
I know them
as white men, and I don't.

1258
01:37:19,008 --> 01:37:20,771
Russell,

1259
01:37:20,843 --> 01:37:23,505
if nobody ever lifted a finger
until people were deserving,

1260
01:37:23,579 --> 01:37:25,945
the whole world
would go to hell.

1261
01:37:26,015 --> 01:37:28,950
We better deal
with each other out of need

1262
01:37:29,018 --> 01:37:30,451
and forget merit,

1263
01:37:30,519 --> 01:37:33,920
because none of us
have too much of that...

1264
01:37:33,990 --> 01:37:35,958
not me, not you,
not anybody.

1265
01:37:36,025 --> 01:37:38,960
If it bothers you,
why talk about it?

1266
01:37:45,034 --> 01:37:47,229
[Mexican]
Hey, man!

1267
01:37:47,303 --> 01:37:49,794
Do you hear me?

1268
01:37:49,872 --> 01:37:54,969
Come on down here!
I got something for you.

1269
01:37:55,044 --> 01:37:59,413
Hey, hombre,
whatever is your name...

1270
01:38:00,983 --> 01:38:02,917
do you hear me?

1271
01:38:05,488 --> 01:38:07,422
[Audra]
Alex!

1272
01:38:07,490 --> 01:38:09,924
Alex! Alex!

1273
01:38:09,992 --> 01:38:11,926
[Crying]

1274
01:38:14,964 --> 01:38:19,424
Alex, please!
Please help me!

1275
01:38:19,502 --> 01:38:22,618
Alex! Alex!

1276
01:38:25,087 --> 01:38:26,850
God sees this,

1277
01:38:26,922 --> 01:38:31,359
and if we live,
we must live in fear of him.

1278
01:38:33,429 --> 01:38:35,863
At least that's what
they frightened me with

1279
01:38:35,931 --> 01:38:37,364
when I was a child.

1280
01:38:37,433 --> 01:38:39,367
Don't be frightened,
Mr. Mendez.

1281
01:38:39,435 --> 01:38:41,369
There is no God.

1282
01:38:41,437 --> 01:38:43,871
Not in either of us, perhaps.

1283
01:38:43,939 --> 01:38:45,133
Not anywhere.

1284
01:38:45,207 --> 01:38:47,869
Nothing, Dr. Favor?

1285
01:38:47,943 --> 01:38:49,308
Nothing.

1286
01:38:49,378 --> 01:38:50,811
You're sure?

1287
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,814
No reward in heaven?

1288
01:38:52,882 --> 01:38:55,316
Why lie to ourselves?

1289
01:38:55,384 --> 01:38:56,817
Well, hell, then?

1290
01:38:56,886 --> 01:38:59,821
A little bit of hell, maybe?

1291
01:38:59,889 --> 01:39:01,823
Ah, yes.

1292
01:39:01,891 --> 01:39:03,756
There's hell.

1293
01:39:07,897 --> 01:39:09,330
[Audra Faintly]
Alex?

1294
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,334
Alex?

1295
01:39:17,406 --> 01:39:18,839
Alex?

1296
01:39:21,477 --> 01:39:22,842
Alex?

1297
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,347
Alex?

1298
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:29,850
Alex?

1299
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:33,081
Alex?

1300
01:39:34,423 --> 01:39:35,856
Alex?

1301
01:39:38,928 --> 01:39:40,862
Alex?

1302
01:39:42,431 --> 01:39:44,831
Alex?

1303
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:46,367
Alex?

1304
01:39:46,435 --> 01:39:49,302
[Doris]
By dark, she'll be dead.

1305
01:39:51,874 --> 01:39:54,672
Isn't somebody
going to do something?

1306
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:05,982
All right.

1307
01:40:06,055 --> 01:40:08,717
Somebody want
to go down there, go ahead.

1308
01:40:08,791 --> 01:40:11,988
Just one thing...

1309
01:40:12,061 --> 01:40:14,359
You walk down there,
you're not going to walk back.

1310
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:17,763
You leave the bag and start up with the
woman, they're gonna kill both of you.

1311
01:40:17,833 --> 01:40:21,064
You're saying that so nobody
will take the money and try.

1312
01:40:21,136 --> 01:40:23,832
They'll kill both of you.

1313
01:40:23,906 --> 01:40:25,840
That's why I'm saying it.

1314
01:40:25,908 --> 01:40:27,842
That's your wife down there.

1315
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:29,969
You going to cut her loose?

1316
01:40:34,416 --> 01:40:36,680
Mendez, you going to save her?

1317
01:40:44,927 --> 01:40:47,361
Billy Lee What's-your-last-name,

1318
01:40:47,429 --> 01:40:49,795
you going to go down there?

1319
01:40:49,865 --> 01:40:51,298
This one won't.

1320
01:40:51,367 --> 01:40:53,130
That's his woman,
but he won't do it.

1321
01:40:53,202 --> 01:40:54,965
He doesn't care enough
about his own woman,

1322
01:40:55,037 --> 01:40:56,905
but maybe somebody else does.

1323
01:40:56,905 --> 01:40:57,894
But maybe somebody else does.

1324
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:01,706
All right. You, lady.

1325
01:41:01,777 --> 01:41:04,803
You worry about his wife
more than he does.

1326
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,313
Go on down there,

1327
01:41:06,382 --> 01:41:09,818
cut her loose, start back up again,
get shot in the back...

1328
01:41:09,885 --> 01:41:11,944
or in front, if the Mexican
by the trough does it.

1329
01:41:12,021 --> 01:41:14,888
In the back or in the front,
one way or the other.

1330
01:41:29,405 --> 01:41:31,339
Just give me your knife.

1331
01:41:31,407 --> 01:41:33,705
That's all I want from you.

1332
01:41:36,912 --> 01:41:40,348
You want a lot more
than that from me, lady.

1333
01:42:20,622 --> 01:42:22,317
All right.
Kid, come here.

1334
01:42:29,798 --> 01:42:32,232
I'm not looking
to get myself killed,

1335
01:42:32,301 --> 01:42:33,734
so pay attention.

1336
01:42:33,802 --> 01:42:36,236
You know how
to use this?

1337
01:42:36,305 --> 01:42:37,738
I guess so.

1338
01:42:37,806 --> 01:42:40,240
Ejects and loads.
It's ready now.

1339
01:42:40,309 --> 01:42:41,742
There's one in there,

1340
01:42:41,810 --> 01:42:44,745
and I hope
you only need the one.

1341
01:42:44,813 --> 01:42:46,576
Watch the Mexican.

1342
01:42:49,618 --> 01:42:51,552
After I go past him,

1343
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:54,054
he'll come out
with his back to you.

1344
01:42:54,123 --> 01:42:56,387
If he touches his gun,
shoot him.

1345
01:42:56,458 --> 01:42:57,823
In the back?

1346
01:42:57,893 --> 01:43:00,555
I'll ask him
to turn around.

1347
01:43:02,131 --> 01:43:04,065
There's something else...
the money.

1348
01:43:04,133 --> 01:43:05,566
What about it?

1349
01:43:05,634 --> 01:43:09,570
Maybe it's you who will have to
take it up to San Carlos after,

1350
01:43:09,638 --> 01:43:11,572
but that's easy, huh?

1351
01:43:17,646 --> 01:43:20,080
I thought you were
keeping it for yourself.

1352
01:43:20,149 --> 01:43:22,083
Think what
you want to think.

1353
01:43:22,151 --> 01:43:23,778
That's up to you.

1354
01:43:23,852 --> 01:43:26,320
All of us thought so.

1355
01:43:26,388 --> 01:43:29,084
It belongs to those
people up there.

1356
01:43:29,158 --> 01:43:31,092
I grew up
on their land.

1357
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:33,094
I hunted
every foot of it.

1358
01:43:33,162 --> 01:43:35,255
Maybe you take
the money back

1359
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:36,763
I owe it.

1360
01:43:38,667 --> 01:43:40,601
I'll see it gets back.

1361
01:43:40,669 --> 01:43:44,435
Tell them to cut you out
a plain ten-dollar horse

1362
01:43:44,506 --> 01:43:45,973
by way of thanks.

1363
01:43:54,616 --> 01:43:57,050
All that trouble
you went to, huh?

1364
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:01,384
It's a shock to grow old,
Mr. Russell.

1365
01:44:12,134 --> 01:44:13,226
Hey!

1366
01:44:14,803 --> 01:44:17,567
Got something for you.

1367
01:46:06,615 --> 01:46:10,551
Mister, you got
a lot of hard bark on you,

1368
01:46:10,619 --> 01:46:12,644
walking down here
like this.

1369
01:46:32,407 --> 01:46:33,840
Now I owe you.

1370
01:46:33,909 --> 01:46:36,503
You put two holes in me.

1371
01:46:36,578 --> 01:46:39,342
That's usually enough
for most of them.

1372
01:46:39,414 --> 01:46:40,847
Don't try it again.

1373
01:46:40,916 --> 01:46:43,885
That vaquero is more
than a fair hand.

1374
01:46:43,952 --> 01:46:46,182
You got the money?

1375
01:46:46,254 --> 01:46:49,280
Unless I brought
my dirty laundry by mistake.

1376
01:46:49,358 --> 01:46:51,326
Let me see it.

1377
01:46:51,393 --> 01:46:52,860
You look for yourself.

1378
01:47:00,869 --> 01:47:02,734
Come on. Hurry up.

1379
01:47:20,288 --> 01:47:22,722
Oh,
get out of the way.

1380
01:47:22,791 --> 01:47:24,418
Please get out of the way.

1381
01:47:28,964 --> 01:47:31,899
Well, now.

1382
01:47:31,967 --> 01:47:36,404
What do you suppose hell
is going to look like?

1383
01:47:36,471 --> 01:47:39,907
We all die. It's just
a question of when.

1384
01:48:38,467 --> 01:48:40,492
Mr. Mendez?

1385
01:48:40,569 --> 01:48:42,230
This one's still alive.

1386
01:49:10,932 --> 01:49:16,529
I would like at least
to know his name.

1387
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:20,874
He was called
John Russell.
