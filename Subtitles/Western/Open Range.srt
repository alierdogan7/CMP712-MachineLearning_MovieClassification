Charley sometimes.

if he likes me.

about hiring me on.

It was Charley
that talked him into it,

57

and I ain't one to take
a man's confidence lightly.

58

You know I ain't, either.

59

to keep remembering it

closer to camp.

before we see another town.

Looks like he's been liing out
of saddlebags most of his life.

180
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:23,754
Got his horse in the corral.

181
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:25,231
Ride with you, does he?

182
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,097
Know where we can find him?

183
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:28,567
Yeah.

184
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:30,365
Yeah, he's up in the jailhouse.

185
00:19:30,438 --> 00:19:33,566
He got into it
with some cattlemen

186
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:34,938
oer at the general store.

187
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,670
- Some cattlemen.
- Yeah.

188
00:19:36,744 --> 00:19:38,405
Busted them up pretty bad, too,

189
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:40,344
before Marshal Poole came up

190
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,542
and hit him oer the head
with his gun barrel.

191
00:19:42,617 --> 00:19:46,053
Yeah, he's lucky he
didn't get shot in the back.

192
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,145
You might want to keep that
in mind

193
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:50,282
when you're talking
to Marshal Poole.

194
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:52,155
Saddle his horse.

195
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:53,524
That coer what he owes?

196
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:54,789
Oh, yeah.

197
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:57,764
Name's Percy if you should need
anything else.

198
00:19:57,832 --> 00:19:59,299
Much obliged.

199
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:00,925
Hold on.

200
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:13,175
BAXTER:
How long you had him here?

201
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:16,274
I brought him in here
yesterday afternoon.

202
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,751
It wasn't easy
getting him into the cell.

203
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,912
Why is that?

204
00:20:19,988 --> 00:20:22,684
Goddamn bear.
Size of it.

205
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:28,794
Eening.
Name's Boss Spearman.

206
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:30,888
This here's Charley Waite.

207
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,626
Eening.

208
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:34,725
Beliee you hae
a friend of ours.

209
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:37,999
Name's Mose Harrison.

210
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:40,040
Yeah, I got him here.

211
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:44,135
He started a fight
in the general store.

212
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:48,046
Mose don't start fights,
just finishes them.

213
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:51,483
I just said he started it.
You said he didn't.

214
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:52,985
Maybe you're calling me a liar.

215
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:54,885
You got a charge against him?

216
00:20:54,956 --> 00:20:56,719
I got plenty.

217
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,851
Inciting a fight.
Disturbing the peace.

218
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:02,726
Creating a public nuisance.
Take your pick.

219
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:04,697
Hear tell he got hit
oer the head.

220
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:05,960
[Scoffs]

221
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:08,968
He'll be fine.

222
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:11,699
Well, I come to get him.

223
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:16,540
Well, you pay the fines,
and you can hae him.

224
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:21,514
How does $50 each offense sound?

225
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:23,516
Like robbery.

226
00:21:26,387 --> 00:21:28,082
Lot of money.

227
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:30,818
Oh, yes, a lot of money.

228
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:34,251
I been waiting for you,
Mr. Spearman.

229
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:37,025
My name's Denton Baxter.

230
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:38,929
Be your men Mose tussled with.

231
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,695
That's right.

232
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:43,396
You know, folks
in Fort Harmon country

233
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:47,100
don't take to free grazers
or free grazing.

234
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:50,269
They hate them more than they
used to hate the Indians.

235
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:54,372
I expect by "folks,"
you mean ranchers like yourself.

236
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:58,345
I got the biggest spread around.

237
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:00,546
Bigger than any three or four
put together.

238
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:02,680
Built it up with me own
two hands,

239
00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:04,554
piece by piece,

240
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,957
along with this town.

241
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:08,723
And there ain't no
free-graze cattle

242
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:11,492
gonna take the feed
off my cattle on this range.

243
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:13,193
Free graze is legal.

244
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:15,497
Times change, Mr. Spearman.

245
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:19,597
Most folks change with them.
A few holdouts neer do.

246
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:22,937
You know, a few years back,

247
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:25,707
a free-graze outfit
came through.

248
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,840
One night,
the cattle got stampeded,

249
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:32,147
the wagons caught on fire,
and one of those boys

250
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,121
was shot off his horse
in the middle of it all.

251
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,521
Shot in the back, was he?

252
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,830
Your man's horse and rig
are at the liery barn.

253
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,425
You can take him with you
when you leae tonight.

254
00:22:48,503 --> 00:22:51,028
And come sunrise,
you hitch up your wagon

255
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:53,198
and get your damn
free-graze cattle moing

256
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:56,971
and keep them moing till you're
out of Fort Harmon country!

257
00:22:58,146 --> 00:23:00,876
Now, you let Mr. Spearman
fetch his man

258
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:03,382
so he can be on his way.

259
00:23:16,564 --> 00:23:18,862
[Lock rattling]

260
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:24,762
Charley.

261
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,068
- Mose.
- [Grunts]

262
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:33,636
Mose.

263
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:35,375
[Groans painfully]

264
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:40,580
Looks like someone's put the
boots to him after he was down.

265
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:41,986
Does it?

266
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:49,496
Mose, you gotta get up.

267
00:23:49,564 --> 00:23:53,864
Charley, I'm glad to see you.

268
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,195
I don't much like this town.

269
00:23:59,974 --> 00:24:01,805
Here you go.

270
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:05,844
Boy, they really lit into him.

271
00:24:05,913 --> 00:24:07,346
You got a doctor in this town?

272
00:24:07,415 --> 00:24:09,440
Yeah.
Doc Barlow.

273
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:11,985
It's the house up behind
the barn by the church.

274
00:24:12,053 --> 00:24:13,748
Look for a picket fence.

275
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:16,312
He's got a sign out front.

276
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:21,153
Oh, my.
Bring him right in.

277
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:28,427
Lay him down in there.

278
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:40,777
I'll fetch the doctor.

279
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:43,339
Get his legs, Boss.

280
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:45,248
Easy, easy.

281
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:48,621
Good.

282
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,097
I'm Dr. Barlow.

283
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:58,996
Boss Spearman.

284
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:01,328
Charley Waite.

285
00:25:01,402 --> 00:25:03,097
Patient there's Mose Harrison.

286
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:04,729
He works for me.

287
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:06,272
These wounds are old.

288
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,308
Easier to treat
if you bring him in right away.

289
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:11,641
Your marshal had him, and he
don't keep a friendly jail.

290
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:14,408
This is the man who was in the
fight with Dent Baxter's men?

291
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:17,212
He certainly gae
as good as he got.

292
00:25:17,285 --> 00:25:19,378
Broke the arm of one.

293
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:22,388
Knowing them,
they had it coming, I expect.

294
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:24,924
Let's see what we got here.

295
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,391
- Aah!
- Easy.

296
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,655
- Easy, Mose.
- Easy, Mr. Harrison.

297
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:30,663
Nobody's trying to hurt you
on purpose.

298
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:32,756
I'd say you got a couple
of broken ribs.

299
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:35,734
Gonna need to get
this shirt off.

300
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:49,015
Sue, I am gonna need some soap,
some water, and some alcohol.

301
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:58,715
I want you to drink this,
Mr. Harrison.

302
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:01,193
- That's it.
- [Breathes sharply]

303
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:06,257
Let's clean up these cuts
on his face.

304
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:09,701
He's got a nice gash
in his scalp there.

305
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,032
I'd say to good health,

306
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:13,039
but then I'd probably be out
of business.

307
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:17,840
We'll drink to good health
for them that hae it coming.

308
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:23,378
The two of you
can wait in the parlor.

309
00:26:36,631 --> 00:26:38,326
Be better he didn't trael.

310
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:40,924
Well, he'll hae to.

311
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:44,129
How much I owe you, Doctor?

312
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,194
We're een.

313
00:26:45,273 --> 00:26:48,333
I figured I made enough off the
damage he did to Baxter's men.

314
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:50,877
Wish he'd hae made you wealthy.

315
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,540
Ma'am.

316
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:24,407
BOSS: Doc Barlow's got him
a pretty wife.

317
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:26,378
Notice that, did you?

318
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:28,210
Well, I ain't dead.

319
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:29,806
Glad to hear it.

320
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:31,010
Sweet, too.

321
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:34,452
Treated us as good as anybody.
That's a real lady.

322
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:36,319
A woman like that makes a man

323
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,258
think about
setting down roots, eh?

324
00:27:41,629 --> 00:27:43,790
Doc looks like a real
hardworking feller.

325
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:47,356
Probably working away on making
some little ones, too.

326
00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:49,494
Creates quite a picture,
now, don't it?

327
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,696
Yeah.

328
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:53,365
Heard they're worth
a thousand words.

329
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:11,618
[Barks]

330
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,124
Hey, Tig.

331
00:28:26,507 --> 00:28:28,873
Now, where do you suppose he is?

332
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:47,658
Goddamn kid.

333
00:28:49,764 --> 00:28:51,823
Button's all right, Boss.

334
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:58,300
Anyone done him harm, they'd
hae gone through the wagon.

335
00:28:58,372 --> 00:29:01,273
Reckon you're right.

336
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,144
Here he is.

337
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:10,107
If you're awake,
you might want to see this.

338
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:12,209
- Where you been?!
- I seen it before.

339
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:14,277
BUTTON:
Out with the herd.

340
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:16,755
I thought I told you
to stay with the wagon.

341
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:18,917
- What happened to Mose?
- Did you hear what I said?!

342
00:29:18,993 --> 00:29:21,188
Yeah, but what happened?

343
00:29:21,262 --> 00:29:24,629
Run into a little trouble
in that town.

344
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:27,599
Looks like more than a little.

345
00:29:27,668 --> 00:29:29,431
Are we moing on?

346
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:33,098
We always do, don't we,
once we'e grazed off a place?

347
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:43,176
Did I do something wrong?

348
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,241
Just leae him be for a while.

349
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,651
Here.
Hae some coffee.

350
00:29:47,721 --> 00:29:49,916
Made fresh, for a change.

351
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,357
There was three riders scouting
up the herd this morning.

352
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:54,689
Where?

353
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:56,627
Maybe half a mile out.

354
00:29:56,697 --> 00:29:59,530
Just sitting there,
looking at the cattle.

355
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:11,878
BOSS:
Same ones?

356
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:14,312
BUTTON:
Four this time.

357
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:16,212
CHARLE Y:
Country's filling up.

358
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:18,308
BUTTON:
Maybe we should push on.

359
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:20,046
BOSS:
Do no good, Button.

360
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,644
I seen them like Baxter before.

361
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:25,283
He means to hae this herd
or scatter it to the wind.

362
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,190
BUTTON:
If he was gonna take the herd,

363
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:29,252
why not just keep you in town?

364
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,696
Marshal already had Mose.

365
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:34,598
CHARLE Y:
Wants us all in one place.

366
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,863
Far from there when it happens.

367
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:40,600
Don't make no sense, him telling
us to moe on and all.

368
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:43,404
Weren't the only thing he said.

369
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,877
Most time, a man will tell you
his bad intentions

370
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:49,848
if you listen,
let yourself hear.

371
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:54,013
A few years back, a free-graze
outfit come through.

372
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:56,886
That weren't no idle story.

373
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:58,982
BOSS:
Let's find out for certain.

374
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:54,174
Beautiful country.

375
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,976
A man can get lost out here,

376
00:31:58,052 --> 00:32:02,011
forget there's people and things
that ain't so simple as this.

377
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,552
How long we been
riding together, Charley?

378
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:09,553
Nigh on 10 years.

379
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,757
Mm-hmm.

380
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:15,233
You know what they call that,
call it a decade.

381
00:32:15,302 --> 00:32:17,566
Long time.

382
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:20,300
Been a lot of change since then.

383
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:24,170
What's on your mind, Boss?

384
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:28,073
Way I figure it, we can leae
the cattle and run,

385
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:30,582
or you and me can go in the dark
and stop them

386
00:32:30,651 --> 00:32:32,983
before they scatter the herd.

387
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:41,090
You reckon them cows are worth
getting killed oer?

388
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:42,560
The cows is one thing.

389
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,120
But one man telling another

390
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:47,895
where he can go in this
country's something else.

391
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,868
That rancher sat
in that jailhouse,

392
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:52,337
sneering and letting
his lawman lay down the law

393
00:32:52,406 --> 00:32:54,874
till he figured
it was time to show us

394
00:32:54,942 --> 00:32:57,274
that he gae the orders
around here.

395
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,677
Ooh, sticks in my craw.

396
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:08,020
Well, we sure as hell owe them
for what they done to Mose.

397
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:09,385
Yeah.

398
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:14,155
I'll saddle the horses.

399
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:21,698
You two keep a sharp eye out.

400
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:26,272
Got the scatter-gun.
We'll be watching for them.

401
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,638
You'll want to douse that fire.

402
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:30,040
Button, keep to the wagon.

403
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,305
I don't want to see you
out in the open.

404
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:33,869
Okay?

405
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:41,246
I got some sugar in that town.

406
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,890
It's in the wagon.

407
00:34:01,842 --> 00:34:03,969
I wouldn't want to hae him
coming down on me

408
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:05,739
like these cowboys.

409
00:34:05,813 --> 00:34:07,804
What the hell's the matter
with you, Gus?

410
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:10,782
You're twitching all damn night.

411
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:15,686
Damn back's so sore from being
flung into that stoe.

[Grunts]

413
00:34:16,757 --> 00:34:20,591
Feel like I been humped
by a 300-pound whore.

414
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:23,996
Well, Gus, I'd say
you got off easy.

415
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:26,032
Look at my face.

416
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:31,929
Well, you can bet Butler will
square things with that big man

417
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:34,803
for breaking his arm and all.

418
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:37,105
Did you hear it snap?

419
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:40,072
I heard it snap.

420
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:42,445
Lucky for him he shoots
with either hand.

421
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:44,381
[Gun cocks]

422
00:34:44,451 --> 00:34:47,113
BOSS:
One twitch, and you're in hell!

423
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:49,781
Now, get on your feet,
all of you!

424
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:54,619
Now, throw them guns
on the ground.

425
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:56,654
[Gun cocks]

426
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:01,258
I ain't a-gonna say it again.

427
00:35:06,774 --> 00:35:08,935
And kick them away.

428
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:19,745
Which one of you's got
a sore back?

429
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:23,118
Which one?

430
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,158
Him.

431
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:28,254
- You're Gus?
- Yeah.

432
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:30,319
Ought not gang up on a man
three-to-one.

433
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:31,329
Ohh!

434
00:35:31,398 --> 00:35:33,025
Wait a minute, mister.

435
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,830
- It wasn't our idea to jump him.
- Shut up, Wylie.

436
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:37,928
Get up, you son of a bitch.

437
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:41,270
- What's your name?
- Vince.

438
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:44,902
Mighty nice tie-down you got.
You're a gunhand, are you?

439
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:46,605
- You fast?
- No.

440
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,170
Uh-huh.

441
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:51,411
How many riders does he hae?

442
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:54,420
I said, how many riders?

443
00:35:54,488 --> 00:35:57,321
The rest are on their way
to your wagon.

444
00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:02,421
Uhh! Aah!

445
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:05,124
You want to smile now, go ahead.

446
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,258
Be a while before he's of use.

447
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:10,963
Charley, throw me
them saddlebags.

00:36:18,412 --> 00:36:20,209
Put your spook hats on.

The ones in your belt,
put them on.

451

Pretty scary bunch, eh, Charley?

If I hear so much
as a twig break...

462
00:37:08,762 --> 00:37:11,697
I'll come back
and kill you all.

Ooh.
The bastards.

They shot the boy,
but he's alie.

00:38:20,434 --> 00:38:22,402
Is that Mose?

469
00:38:28,342 --> 00:38:29,832
He's dead.

470
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:32,971
Shot him in the head.

00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:47,426
Charley?

473
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,766
Charley, get the lantern
and the whiskey.

474
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,233
Yeah.
[Speaking Spanish]

475
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:04,905
Come on, wake up.

477
00:39:07,214 --> 00:39:11,742
They shot him here and
cracked him in the head here.

478
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:14,048
We'll hae to dig
that bullet out.

You done good, Boss.

480
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:28,701
Him going in and out like that.

481
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:32,296
I don't know.
He lost a lot of blood.

482
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:35,102
A whack on the head
can make a man strange

483
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:38,042
for the rest of his days.

484
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:41,012
Well, you done all you can.

485
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:43,675
He needs a doctor now.

486
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:46,915
If Button lies through morning,

487
00:39:46,987 --> 00:39:49,319
you take him in the wagon
and moe on.

488
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:54,394
You just gonna sit out here
waiting with them cows?

489
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:56,258
That's right.

490
00:39:57,597 --> 00:40:00,088
And I'm gonna kill
eery son of a bitch

491
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:02,499
that comes to take them.

492
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,403
For one man on open ground,

493
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:08,032
you sure got a lot
of killing in mind.

494
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:24,189
You know I neer
gone against you, Boss.

495
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:28,091
Always let you do
most of the talking.

496
00:40:28,161 --> 00:40:30,527
But he needs that doctor
back in that town,

497
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:33,065
and I aim to take him.

498
00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:35,124
If you want to come,
we'll go together.

499
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:40,333
Otherwise, you do what you
hae to do, I'll do the same.

500
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:43,399
You think they'll let you waltz
in there and waltz out?

501
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:44,842
I don't figure into it.

502
00:40:44,911 --> 00:40:47,607
Button deseres eery chance
we can gie him.

503
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:53,452
All right.

504
00:40:57,891 --> 00:41:00,826
But I aim to kill Baxter
and those that done this.

505
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:03,920
And if that marshal gets in the
way, I'm gonna kill him, too.

506
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:07,660
So you best get your mind right
about what's got to be done.

507
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:11,862
I got no problem
with killing, Boss.

508
00:41:11,938 --> 00:41:13,428
Neer hae.

509
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,040
[Metal clanging]

510
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,862
Looks real nice, Charley.

511
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,333
Yeah, a man ought to hae
something to show he was here.

512
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:24,706
Be gone in another big storm.

513
00:42:24,778 --> 00:42:27,338
Don't matter none.
He's got your dog for company.

514
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:31,180
He'd like it you put
old Tig with him.

515
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:33,583
Yeah, he was more
Mose's dog in the end

516
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:35,621
than he was mine.

517
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,782
Be right to say some words.

518
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,420
You want to speak
with the man upstairs, do it.

519
00:42:43,496 --> 00:42:45,589
I'll stand right here
and listen,

520
00:42:45,665 --> 00:42:48,429
but I ain't talking
to that son of a bitch.

521
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:49,900
And I'll be holding a grudge

522
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:54,998
for him letting this befall
a sweet kid like Mose.

523
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,974
Well, he sure as hell
wasn't one to complain.

524
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:07,445
Woke with a smile.

525
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,148
Seemed like he could keep it
there all day.

526
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:13,991
Kind of man that'd say
"good morning" and mean it,

527
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,028
whether it was or not.

528
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:20,789
To tell you the truth, Lord,
if there was two gentler souls,

529
00:43:20,867 --> 00:43:22,630
I neer seen them.

530
00:43:23,803 --> 00:43:27,330
Seemed like old Tig wouldn't
een kill birds in the end.

531
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:31,842
Well, you got yourself
a good man and a good dog,

532
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:33,538
and I'm inclined to agree
with Boss

533
00:43:33,613 --> 00:43:36,047
about holding a grudge
against you for it.

534
00:43:37,651 --> 00:43:39,676
I guess that means "amen."

535
00:44:03,176 --> 00:44:05,110
God.

536
00:44:05,178 --> 00:44:07,112
BOSS:
Charley, you all right?

537
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:14,210
I'm fine.

538
00:44:15,388 --> 00:44:17,253
Seems like you was, you know...

539
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:19,189
I said I'm fine.

540
00:44:21,227 --> 00:44:24,128
Just got some old feelings
coming up.

541
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:28,126
You know, we neer asked
each other much.

542
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:32,069
That's always been okay with me.
I figured it was okay with you.

543
00:44:32,138 --> 00:44:35,301
But you said some things
the last couple of days.

544
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:40,403
Things that seemed like they had
kind of a history to them.

545
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:44,649
Hey, Charley?

546
00:44:44,718 --> 00:44:47,152
Don't stand behind me, Boss.

547
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:14,877
When I was a kid, a bunch of us
would go into the woods

548
00:45:14,948 --> 00:45:16,916
with our peashooters.

549
00:45:16,983 --> 00:45:20,680
Nothing fancy, just enough
to kill a bird or a squirrel,

550
00:45:20,754 --> 00:45:23,780
maybe something larger
if we was lucky.

551
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:28,622
Killed my first man
in them woods.

552
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:33,189
Held the paper on our farm,
and after my pa died,

553
00:45:33,266 --> 00:45:37,100
he'd come around to get payment
from my mom in any way he could.

554
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:42,197
Weren't much older than Button
when I shot him in the throat.

555
00:45:43,643 --> 00:45:47,841
Knew there'd be more killing, so
I run off and joined the Army.

556
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:50,382
War was on.

557
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,941
They was only too happy
to hae me.

558
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:57,781
My first skirmish was like
hunting with my friends.

559
00:45:57,857 --> 00:46:02,157
We just sat up in some trees,
and they came marching at us.

560
00:46:03,196 --> 00:46:08,099
Must hae been a hundred of them
dead after the smoke cleared.

561
00:46:08,168 --> 00:46:10,796
Went around and shot the rest
who weren't.

562
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:15,537
Those of us with the knack
was made into a special squad

563
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:18,076
so we could trael light
and on our own

564
00:46:18,144 --> 00:46:20,203
into enemy territory.

565
00:46:21,214 --> 00:46:25,913
Orders were pretty simple.
Make trouble whereer we could.

566
00:46:25,985 --> 00:46:30,081
With room like that, it wasn't
long before we was killing men

567
00:46:30,156 --> 00:46:32,488
that weren't een in uniform.

568
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,529
Seemed like that went on
the rest of the war.

569
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:40,625
After that, I come West.

570
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:45,264
Lot of call for a man
with them skills.

571
00:46:45,338 --> 00:46:48,830
And I put them to work
for men just like Baxter.

572
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,940
Eery once in a while,
I almost get through a day

573
00:46:57,016 --> 00:47:01,646
without thinking
about who I am, what I'd done.

574
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:13,456
He drifted off again.

575
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:17,094
No better, but no worse, either.

576
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,162
You're a real honest man,
Charley.

577
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,299
Well, I ain't gonna lie
about Button.

578
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:24,843
Not Button I'm talking about.

579
00:47:52,171 --> 00:47:54,196
- Mr. Spearman.
- The doctor in?

580
00:47:54,274 --> 00:47:55,764
No, he's not here.

581
00:47:55,842 --> 00:47:58,310
We got a boy that's hurt bad.

582
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:01,313
Here, put him
in the examining room.

583
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:19,089
It's not his hearing, ma'am.

584
00:48:19,165 --> 00:48:21,133
He hears real well
when he's awake.

585
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,363
Mr. Spearman, I'm checking
if there's blood in his ears.

586
00:48:24,437 --> 00:48:26,928
It could mean a fractured skull.

587
00:48:30,276 --> 00:48:32,141
Are you the boy's father?

588
00:48:32,211 --> 00:48:33,508
No, ma'am.

589
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,174
His name's Button,
and he works for me.

590
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:40,151
It appears that's
not ery healthy.

591
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:44,121
You know the way to the parlor.
Sit down.

592
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:45,817
I'll be a while.

593
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,630
[Thunder rumbling]

594
00:49:08,014 --> 00:49:10,812
Well, I don't think
it's a fracture.

595
00:49:10,883 --> 00:49:14,216
Concussion's more likely,
but it's bad.

596
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:27,593
I hae to admit, we don't see
a lot of people shot.

597
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:31,228
I cleaned and dressed the wound.
Doesn't look infected.

598
00:49:31,304 --> 00:49:32,931
What about the feer?

599
00:49:33,006 --> 00:49:37,033
He needs to lay still
and let his body do its work.

600
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:39,635
No offense, ma'am,
but we come a long way

601
00:49:39,712 --> 00:49:43,944
to see that the boy gets looked
after proper by Dr. Barlow.

602
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:45,279
Now, where's he at?

603
00:49:45,351 --> 00:49:46,875
One of Dent Baxter's hands

604
00:49:46,953 --> 00:49:48,944
came and fetched him
out to the ranch.

605
00:49:49,022 --> 00:49:52,480
Some men there had an accident
night before last.

606
00:49:57,363 --> 00:50:00,560
You must tell me what happened,
Mr. Spearman.

607
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:03,927
Baxter sent his men
to stampede the herd,

608
00:50:04,003 --> 00:50:06,836
and I figured me and Charley
to stop them.

609
00:50:06,906 --> 00:50:10,137
Surprised them where they was
hiding, and we had at them.

610
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:14,111
Them's the one Dr. Barlow's
putting back together.

611
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:18,446
We got back to camp, others
had shot Mose in the head,

612
00:50:18,518 --> 00:50:20,645
shot Button, left him for dead.

613
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,709
Oh.

614
00:50:25,058 --> 00:50:27,117
Shot our dog.

615
00:50:30,096 --> 00:50:31,620
I'll be getting money.

616
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:34,292
It's not necessary.

617
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,358
We pay our way, ma'am.

618
00:50:41,908 --> 00:50:44,809
Please, sit, Mr. Waite.

619
00:50:48,247 --> 00:50:51,148
Button.
Is that his real name?

620
00:50:51,984 --> 00:50:54,452
Please, sit.

621
00:50:56,189 --> 00:50:59,886
Yeah, it's the only one
we'e known.

622
00:51:02,028 --> 00:51:04,258
He's just a boy.

623
00:51:05,264 --> 00:51:06,993
Yeah.

624
00:51:07,066 --> 00:51:09,899
Picked him up in a Texas town
a few years back,

625
00:51:09,969 --> 00:51:12,437
liing off café garbage.

626
00:51:12,505 --> 00:51:14,973
Couldn't speak a word
of English.

627
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:17,839
Thought we was doing him
a faor.

628
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:20,470
What about you?

629
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:22,271
Hmm?

630
00:51:22,348 --> 00:51:24,646
You know that the marshal
works for Baxter.

631
00:51:24,717 --> 00:51:27,208
People saw you ride in.

632
00:51:29,188 --> 00:51:31,179
There's payment to be made
by them that done this.

633
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:33,953
Don't intend to run.

634
00:51:36,863 --> 00:51:39,855
We could wire
for the federal marshal.

635
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:45,562
If he started riding today,
he wouldn't make it for a week.

636
00:51:45,638 --> 00:51:48,630
With the storm coming,
maybe longer.

637
00:51:50,109 --> 00:51:54,011
We're obliged to deal with the
marshal and Baxter ourseles.

638
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,105
What about Button?

639
00:51:58,384 --> 00:52:01,251
Well, he's fighting
for his life.

640
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,582
We're gonna do the same.

641
00:52:02,655 --> 00:52:04,418
[Door opens]

642
00:52:09,262 --> 00:52:13,926
Whateer's needed for Button,
you do it.

643
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,730
If he wakes, he's gonna need
to stay here a couple days

644
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:19,271
so we can watch him.

645
00:52:19,338 --> 00:52:21,772
Whateer's best for him.

646
00:52:34,187 --> 00:52:37,623
Can't stay away from
my little paradise, gents?!

647
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:40,921
Beliee Satan says the same at
the gates of hell, old-timer!

648
00:52:40,993 --> 00:52:42,961
[Laughs]

649
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:46,430
We'd like to put the horses up.
Had a tough trail.

650
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:48,160
I'd like to set
the wagon yonder.

651
00:52:48,234 --> 00:52:50,828
Help yourself!
Hurry up, though!

652
00:52:50,903 --> 00:52:53,497
I seen it like this before!

653
00:52:53,573 --> 00:52:55,632
Big one's coming!

654
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:58,006
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

655
00:54:01,874 --> 00:54:03,899
Son of a bitch.

656
00:54:11,484 --> 00:54:13,452
Sorry, Charley.

657
00:54:16,822 --> 00:54:18,050
Yeah.

658
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,160
[Wood creaking]

659
00:54:33,673 --> 00:54:35,937
Jesus Christ.

660
00:54:40,112 --> 00:54:42,979
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!

661
00:54:47,286 --> 00:54:50,653
Maybe you should hae built it
in another spot.

662
00:54:51,457 --> 00:54:53,982
Ah, mercy.

663
00:54:55,495 --> 00:54:57,622
[Thunder rumbles]

664
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:13,879
MAN:
Get the dog!

665
00:55:13,947 --> 00:55:15,881
Get the dog!

666
00:55:17,717 --> 00:55:19,048
Get the dog!

667
00:55:19,118 --> 00:55:20,449
[Whining]

668
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,318
It's a dog there, Charley.

669
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,894
Take this.

670
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:39,295
There he is.
Back here, Charley!

671
00:55:40,373 --> 00:55:41,704
To your left!
To your left!

672
00:55:41,774 --> 00:55:43,366
Get him!
Get him!

673
00:55:45,878 --> 00:55:47,709
[Laughs]

674
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:52,542
You all right, Charley?

675
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:56,487
Yeah, considering
I'e just been swimming.

676
00:56:01,594 --> 00:56:03,562
I owe you, mister.

677
00:56:04,464 --> 00:56:06,398
That's a sweet pup
you got there.

678
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:09,458
Remind you of anyone, Charley?

679
00:56:09,535 --> 00:56:11,366
Small ersion.

680
00:56:11,437 --> 00:56:13,268
Too small to be let out
in this weather.

681
00:56:13,339 --> 00:56:15,204
Belongs to my daughter.

682
00:56:15,274 --> 00:56:18,869
I tried to grab him, but
the water was too fast for me.

683
00:56:19,512 --> 00:56:21,776
If you're going into the café,

684
00:56:21,848 --> 00:56:24,840
I'd be proud to buy you both
a cup of coffee.

685
00:56:28,187 --> 00:56:30,621
Coffee would be good about now.

686
00:56:36,462 --> 00:56:38,794
This is like the storm
that washed away Gunnison

687
00:56:38,865 --> 00:56:40,662
10, 12 years back.

688

The water come down
from the mountains.

689
00:56:43,703 --> 00:56:46,399
Nowhere to go
but straight into town.

690
00:56:46,472 --> 00:56:48,599
- Killed a lot of folks.
- It's okay, Bill.

691
00:56:48,675 --> 00:56:51,337
Town's been here
a long time, Mack.

692
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:53,038
It'll be here a lot longer.

693
00:56:53,112 --> 00:56:54,636
That's right, Papa.

694
00:56:54,714 --> 00:56:57,148
Eery once in a while,
a good storm washes through

695
00:56:57,216 --> 00:57:01,448
and leaes her as clean
as a baby's bottom.

696
00:57:01,521 --> 00:57:04,046
Got to look
on the bright side, gents.

698
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:20,803
Meat and spuds, Les, as always.

699
00:57:23,476 --> 00:57:25,501
That should coer our meal.

700
00:57:26,846 --> 00:57:30,009
Worth a man's life to walk
across that road tonight.

701
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,573
Thanks for the coffee.

702
00:57:31,651 --> 00:57:34,085
Well, appreciate what you done.

703
00:57:36,022 --> 00:57:38,957
That'll be two bits.

704
00:57:39,025 --> 00:57:40,515
Two bits.

705
00:57:45,765 --> 00:57:47,995
[Thunder rumbling]

706
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:04,882
I'll be haing words
with you two.

707
00:58:04,951 --> 00:58:08,478
And we'll be haing more
than that with you, Marshal.

708
00:58:19,766 --> 00:58:23,497
No need to make
the café messy... with folks.

709
00:58:23,569 --> 00:58:25,901
I'e got a warrant sworn out
for your arrest

710
00:58:25,972 --> 00:58:27,667
for assaulting Baxter's men.

711
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,867
We got a warrant sworn
for attempted murder

712
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:31,432
for them that tried
to kill the boy

713
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:33,809
who's laying oer there
at the doc's.

714
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,869
Swore out another one

715
00:58:34,947 --> 00:58:38,144
for them that murdered the big
fellow you had in your cell.

716
00:58:38,217 --> 00:58:39,980
Only ours ain't writ
by no tin star

717
00:58:40,052 --> 00:58:41,815
bought and paid for, Marshal.

718
00:58:41,888 --> 00:58:45,585
It's writ by us.
And we aim to enforce it.

719
00:58:45,658 --> 00:58:47,319
Is that so?

720
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:50,624
We got no quarrel
with none of you folks.

721
00:58:50,696 --> 00:58:54,223
Baxter's men bushwhacked
our friend and shot him dead.

722
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,495
Shot a 16-year-old boy, too.

723
00:58:56,569 --> 00:58:59,060
And clubbed him so hard...

724
00:59:00,606 --> 00:59:03,131
He might not lie.

725
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:05,973
Tried to take our cattle.

726
00:59:06,045 --> 00:59:09,242
Your marshal here ain't gonna do
nothing about it.

727
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,878
You don't like free grazers
in this town.

728
00:59:13,953 --> 00:59:15,511
We don't much like being here.

729
00:59:15,588 --> 00:59:17,852
But a man's got a right
to protect his property

730
00:59:17,924 --> 00:59:19,448
and his life.

731
00:59:19,525 --> 00:59:24,326
And we ain't letting no rancher
or his lawman take either.

732
00:59:25,665 --> 00:59:28,361
We got no intention
of harming bystanders.

733
00:59:28,434 --> 00:59:30,061
Anyone who helps or comforts

734
00:59:30,136 --> 00:59:33,230
these goddamn lawbreaking
free grazers

735
00:59:33,306 --> 00:59:36,002
is gonna hae to deal with me.

736
00:59:49,021 --> 00:59:50,955
Your call, Marshal.

737
00:59:55,528 --> 00:59:59,157
We don't hae to settle this
here and now.

738
00:59:59,232 --> 01:00:02,224
You ain't going nowhere
in this weather.

739
01:00:02,301 --> 01:00:04,769
But I'll be seeing you gents
real soon.

740
01:00:04,837 --> 01:00:06,896
You can count on that.

741
01:00:12,245 --> 01:00:14,236
[Thunder crashes]

742
01:00:19,752 --> 01:00:22,220
That marshal ain't gonna wait.

743
01:00:22,288 --> 01:00:25,553
That son of a bitch is gonna get
some men, come looking for us.

744
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:27,923
He's gonna need us locked up
tight in that jail

745
01:00:27,994 --> 01:00:30,360
by the time Baxter hits town,
'cause if we ain't,

746
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:31,896
Baxter's gonna start to think

747
01:00:31,964 --> 01:00:35,525
that maybe Marshal Poole ain't
worth what he's paying him.

748
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:39,128
You got something on your mind,
just spit it out.

749
01:00:39,205 --> 01:00:41,935
Well, I say we take him
right at the jail.

750
01:00:42,008 --> 01:00:44,841
Lock him up, wait for Baxter
to come riding in.

751
01:00:44,911 --> 01:00:47,675
Hell, Charley, why don't we
just ride out to Baxter's ranch

752
01:00:47,747 --> 01:00:50,307
and go straight at him, too?

753
01:00:51,751 --> 01:00:53,514
Well, I'll fight
whereer you want, Boss.

754
01:00:53,586 --> 01:00:54,746
You just make the call.

755
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,412
God damn it.

756
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:58,286
Now, hold on, Charley.
Hold on.

757
01:00:58,357 --> 01:01:01,190
Well, you asked me.
I told you.

758
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:09,029
Charley, come on in
out of the rain, would you?

759
01:01:09,101 --> 01:01:10,762
Come on.

760
01:01:14,874 --> 01:01:16,341
Come on.

761
01:01:21,614 --> 01:01:23,275
Just getting testy
in my old age.

762
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:24,976
Sounds like it's not
such a bad idea.

763
01:01:25,051 --> 01:01:27,144
Just roll it around
is all I ask.

764
01:01:27,219 --> 01:01:28,948
All right.

765
01:01:30,489 --> 01:01:32,889
What'd you think of my speech
in there?

766
01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:37,922
Liked it.

767
01:01:37,997 --> 01:01:41,091
Maybe I ought to run
for mayor.

768
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:43,499
Well, I beliee officeholders
got to be liing, Boss.

769
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:45,560
[Laughs]

770
01:01:50,943 --> 01:01:52,274
[Knock on door]

771
01:01:52,411 --> 01:01:54,379
BOSS:
Come to see about the boy.

772
01:01:54,447 --> 01:01:58,076
He's asleep.
But, please, come in.

773
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:00,675
Are you sure, ma'am?
We're a mite rank.

774
01:02:00,753 --> 01:02:02,277
We don't want to mess
your house.

775
01:02:02,355 --> 01:02:04,050
No, no.
No, please, it's all right.

776
01:02:04,123 --> 01:02:05,784
Come on in.

777
01:02:39,825 --> 01:02:41,588
Thank you, ma'am.

778
01:02:43,362 --> 01:02:45,159
There you are.

779
01:02:56,275 --> 01:02:57,936
[Boss chuckles]

780
01:02:59,211 --> 01:03:02,180
I can't get my fingers in.

781
01:03:06,218 --> 01:03:08,413
We can't get our big fat fingers
in these holes.

782
01:03:08,487 --> 01:03:10,853
- [Laughs]
- Too many broke knuckles.

783
01:03:10,923 --> 01:03:12,618
Oh, let me get you
something bigger.

784
01:03:12,691 --> 01:03:15,990
- No, ma'am, we can make do.
- No, no. It's all right.

785
01:03:16,062 --> 01:03:20,863
It's just nice to be sitting
at a table set with fine china.

786
01:03:20,933 --> 01:03:23,697
Those were my mother's.

787
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:25,134
They were the only things
of hers

788
01:03:25,204 --> 01:03:27,832
that suried the trip
out here.

789
01:03:27,907 --> 01:03:29,807
I don't know why
I bring them out.

790
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:32,435
I can't hold them, either.

791
01:03:32,511 --> 01:03:35,002
Guess it just makes me
feel good.

792
01:03:35,081 --> 01:03:37,606
BOSS: I say what's
on my mind, good or bad.

793
01:03:37,683 --> 01:03:39,014
SUE:
I admire that.

794
01:03:39,085 --> 01:03:41,553
Try liing with it.

795
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,850
See that?

796
01:03:43,923 --> 01:03:45,413
No need for a wife or home.

797
01:03:45,491 --> 01:03:48,187
We're just like a...
an old married couple.

798
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,727
[Laughter]

799
01:03:49,795 --> 01:03:51,990
So, is it marriage
that scares you two

800
01:03:52,064 --> 01:03:54,191
- or putting down roots?
- No. Who'd hae him?

801
01:03:54,266 --> 01:03:57,827
All rangy and mangy
like a rough old dog.

802
01:03:57,903 --> 01:03:59,564
How about I hold
your head underwater

803
01:03:59,638 --> 01:04:01,799
for just a little while?

804
01:04:12,184 --> 01:04:14,175
BOSS:
I married once.

805
01:04:15,821 --> 01:04:18,085
Neer knowed that,
did you, Charley?

806
01:04:18,157 --> 01:04:20,557
Had a wife and child.

807
01:04:20,626 --> 01:04:21,957
Sweet little spread, too.

808
01:04:22,027 --> 01:04:26,464
It was nothing fancy,
but we was young.

809
01:04:26,532 --> 01:04:29,092
Loed each other.

810
01:04:29,168 --> 01:04:31,432
Neer had a cross word.

811
01:04:32,638 --> 01:04:34,162
They caught the typhus
and died.

812
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,438
And after that, home didn't seem
a place to spend time.

813
01:04:38,511 --> 01:04:40,445
Beliee I'e changed
my mind on that

814
01:04:40,513 --> 01:04:43,539
now that I'm getting on
in years.

815
01:04:48,787 --> 01:04:53,224
If Button lies
and we surie Baxter,

816
01:04:53,292 --> 01:04:57,023
I swear I aim to see to it
there's a home he's sleeping in

817
01:04:57,096 --> 01:04:59,792
instead of the cold prairie.

818
01:05:07,907 --> 01:05:09,807
Hae yourself a last cup
of tea, Charley.

819
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:11,866
I'd like to see Button again,
Miss Barlow.

820
01:05:11,944 --> 01:05:12,933
Of course.

821
01:05:13,012 --> 01:05:14,536
I know the way.

822
01:05:17,716 --> 01:05:19,479
Whew.

823
01:05:29,428 --> 01:05:32,397
Been riding with him 10 years.

824
01:05:32,464 --> 01:05:34,762
Neer said nothing
about being married.

825
01:05:43,576 --> 01:05:45,840
Where are you and Mr. Spearman
spending the night?

826
01:05:45,911 --> 01:05:46,900
Don't rightly know.

827
01:05:46,979 --> 01:05:51,439
It... depends on circumstances.

828
01:05:51,517 --> 01:05:53,917
You mean Marshal Poole?

829
01:05:53,986 --> 01:05:56,454
We hae a spare room.
It's yours if you want it.

830
01:05:56,522 --> 01:05:57,546
Couldn't do that, ma'am.

831
01:05:57,623 --> 01:06:00,558
We'd be putting you in a spot
with the marshal and Baxter.

832
01:06:00,626 --> 01:06:03,754
Besides, it's a small town.

833
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:07,492
Wouldn't look right,
particularly with the doc away.

834
01:06:26,452 --> 01:06:28,443
I'll take those.

835
01:06:29,388 --> 01:06:31,253
You know where they go?

836
01:06:31,323 --> 01:06:32,415
I saw.

837
01:06:32,491 --> 01:06:34,220
Thank you.

838
01:06:36,061 --> 01:06:39,121
Been raining like hell
eer since we got here.

839
01:06:39,198 --> 01:06:42,725
Water washing right down
Main Street.

840
01:06:42,801 --> 01:06:45,395
Charley saed a pup
from being washed away.

841
01:06:45,471 --> 01:06:47,701
Looked a little like old Tig.

842
01:06:52,311 --> 01:06:55,474
Now, if you can, you got to
listen and pay attention.

843
01:06:56,915 --> 01:07:00,510
'Cause I got something
important to say.

844
01:07:00,586 --> 01:07:05,285
I ain't been looking after you
for you to go out this way.

845
01:07:05,357 --> 01:07:07,825
The world ain't
a perfect place, Button.

846
01:07:07,893 --> 01:07:10,726
But you got
unfinished business here.

847
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:15,032
So you come back,
you hear me, now?

848
01:07:16,302 --> 01:07:17,929
You come back.

849
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:27,075
Kind of dumb talking to him
like that.

850
01:07:27,146 --> 01:07:28,170
No.

851
01:07:28,247 --> 01:07:30,215
No, it's good.

852
01:07:32,051 --> 01:07:33,780
You all right, Mr. Spearman?

853
01:07:33,852 --> 01:07:37,185
Beliee I'm as right as a man
can be under the circumstances.

854
01:07:37,256 --> 01:07:40,623
Circumstances? That's just what
Mr. Waite called them.

855
01:07:40,693 --> 01:07:44,561
I asked him to reconsider,
and I'm asking you.

856
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:47,793
By "reconsider,"
you mean tuck tail and run?

857
01:07:47,866 --> 01:07:50,801
I mean sae your life and his.

858
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:53,099
He'll listen to you.

859
01:07:53,172 --> 01:07:55,538
Charley thinks for hisself,
Miss Barlow.

860
01:07:55,607 --> 01:07:58,804
He's a good man, and he knows
what has to be done.

861
01:08:00,145 --> 01:08:02,773
I'll be paying you now
for whateer else Button needs.

862
01:08:02,848 --> 01:08:04,577
In case it goes bad
for Charley and me,

863
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:08,711
maybe you and the doc will see
we're taken care of properly.

864
01:08:09,288 --> 01:08:12,382
I'd like to put pen to paper
if you hae them.

865
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:14,949
Yes. Of course.

866
01:09:09,615 --> 01:09:11,742
SUE:
Mr. Waite?

867
01:09:11,817 --> 01:09:13,717
Look at my face.

868
01:09:14,953 --> 01:09:17,114
- Oh! Sorry!
- [Gun cocks]

869
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:21,384
[Gasping]
I'm sorry.

870
01:09:22,494 --> 01:09:23,984
It's all right, Charley.

871
01:09:24,062 --> 01:09:26,189
Okay?
It just be us.

872
01:09:29,535 --> 01:09:31,400
It's all right, Charley.

873
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:43,038
It's all right, Charley.

874
01:09:48,987 --> 01:09:51,387
It's all right.
I'll get it.

875
