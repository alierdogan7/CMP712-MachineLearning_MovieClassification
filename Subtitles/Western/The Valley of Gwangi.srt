Migue.

00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:10,675
No, no.

7
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:15,181
Leave it. He who takes
from Gwangi the evi one is cursed.

00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:17,911
-Ony by an od woman's tongue.

00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,721
Keep your superstitions

00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:33,660
Foo.

13
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,499
One day he wi earn
to obey the aw of Gwangi...

14
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:42,304
...or ike his brother, he wi perish.

15
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:00,799
Howdy, ma'am.

16
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,679

-You want to do something for me?

-Two mies out of town.

24
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,310
-Two mies?
-You' need that horse, senor. And a guide.

-Now how about getting me that horse?
-Ten pesos, senor.

00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,304
The first miion's
aways the toughest, Lope.

33
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,451
Ladies and gentemen...

Now, what in the name of Sam Hi
brings you around here?

41
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:15,236
Up to no good, that's for sure.

42
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:17,565
You don't seem gad to see me, Champ.

43
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,641
About as gad as a dying mue
to see a vuture.

44
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,108
'm no vuture.
Bird on the wing, maybe.

45
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,409
Yeah, fying to the next quick buck.
We, it ooks ike you finay made it.

46
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,347

-A you care about is yoursef...

00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,750
...no matter who gets hurt.

48
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:37,051
Yeah, aways did.
Fussing around her ike a mother hen.

49
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:41,322
Her daddy was a friend. Somebody's
gotta protect her from guys ike you.

50
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,955
-Running out on her ike you did.
-You weren't sorry to see me go.

51
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:48,069
Nope, but it darn near broke T.J.'s heart.

52
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:52,200
Yeah. From what  hear,
you're not doing so good by her either.

53
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,275
Not enough customers
to pay the bi.

54
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:58,673
We don't need any big shot coming
around here teing us how to run this show.

55
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,578
-Now, why don't you just go back--
-Wait a minute.

56
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:06,016
We, that's her tune.
That's the grand finae, isn't it?

57
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,180
We, now, 'm surprised you remembered.

58
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:14,225
We, excuse me,  gotta see this.
For od times' sake, you understand?

59
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,226
Caros.

60
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:30,691
Hurry up with that ramp.

61
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:18,707
-Howdy there, partner.
-Ex-partner.

62
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,475
And to what do we owe
this unpeasant surprise?

63
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,880
-'m just ooking around.
-For troube.

64
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:28,012
They say it comes in threes.
wonder what the next two wi be.

65
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,256
Hey, you can't go in there!

66
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:34,991
Get out.

67
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:37,997
-Been a ong time, T.J.
-Do you want to get kied?

68
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,965
You're the one
who's aways trying it out there.

69
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:43,001
Don't start that again.

70
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,800
You and me are gonna have
a nice itte tak...

71
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:48,102
...or  might just
put you across my knee.

72
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:51,678
Fat chance. This is T.J., remember?

73
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:53,974
Sure,  remember.

74
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:59,552
-f you don't mind, 'd ike to change.
-We, go on, go ahead.

75
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:05,789
Hey, you hesitated up there,
before the jump.

76
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:09,055
The sight of you woud upset
your own mother.

77
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:12,166
-Not puing much of a crowd.
-We pay Viarosa next.

78
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:14,268
Things wi be better there.

79
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,336
-You sure?
-Sure, 'm sure.

80
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,535
-Why is that?
-What do you care?

81
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:21,141
You've got your own business now.

82
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,835
Yep. That's right. A one-man operation.

83
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:26,538
Sitting in a nice office,
buying and seing acts...

84
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:29,377
...instead of getting knocked off
horses for 1 0 bucks.

85
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:33,181
-t's haf the risk, twice the pay.
-So mind your own business.

86
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:36,017
'm doing just that.
Got a dea for you, T.J.

87
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:39,388
Get you off the hook with
this broken-down, moth-eaten rodeo.

88
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:41,860
-f you got a brain, you' take it.
-Thanks.

89
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:46,496
Buffao Bi wants to buy Omar the
Wonder Horse. He's offering a good price.

90
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:49,638
-And you get 1 0°%, right?
-Twenty.

91
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:53,997
We, you're not getting
one thin dime out of me.

92
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:58,613
And Buffao Bi is not getting Omar.
And you needn't think you can come...

93
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:02,717
...busting in here ike some hick-town
horse-deaer trying to ruin my show.

94
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:06,753
There's peope depending on me:
Champ, Caros, Bean, Rowdy.

95
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:09,686
But you woudn't know much
about oyaty, woud you?

96
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:12,716
-This is business.
-You pay your con tricks...

97
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:16,490
...and ' stick to horse tricks.
Now beat it.

98
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:21,996
My, my. Aways did ook sweet in a temper.

99
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:26,568
-Get out,  said.
-A right, 've hotter irons in the fire.

100
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:30,542
You just keep strugging, eaping off
patforms into a pot of water.

101
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:33,739
Break your neck if you want to.
Makes no difference to me.

102
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,008
Good.

103
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:39,621
Just worried about that horse up there.
Woudn't ike anything to happen to him.

104
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,390
Excuse me.

105
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:55,134
Good for you, T.J. You shoud've done
that a ong time ago. Thrown him out.

106
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:11,981
say! Heo, there. Over here, sir!

107
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:15,981
-Someone you know?
-A cient of mine, Professor Bromey.

108
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:19,491
-What's he doing out there?
-He digs for od bones and things.

109
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:21,186
Heo!

110
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:24,696
Sounds ike he dug himsef
into troube. Come on.

111
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:33,032
- say, thank heavens you came aong.
-What has happened, professor?

112
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,871
''What has happened, professor?''
You know very we what has happened.

113
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:39,879
-Rosita?
-Rosita. Rosita's my mue.

114
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:42,745
She absoutey refused to budge.
Then she kicked me.

115
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,216
- don't know where she's gone now.
-You hurt?

116
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:51,553
We, there are no bones broken,
but it's frightfuy painfu.

117
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:54,594
Oh,  don't beieve we've met.
My name is Bromey.

118
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,754
-Hi, name's Tuck Kirby.
-How do you do?

119
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,560
Hey, hop on, we' give you a ride back.

120
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:04,833
We, perhaps Lope's mount
might be a itte more practica.

121
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:07,737
Wait, my boy.

122
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,878
Up.

123
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:11,444
Right.

124
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:17,811
You ought to know better than
to get behind a stubborn mue.

125
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:22,218
Your advice comes a itte ate, Mr. Kirby.

126
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:31,130
Look, professor,
Rosita's found her way home.

127
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,564
Vicious beast.

128
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,537
Give me your shouder, Lope.

129
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:51,417
'd say you coud use
a good, stiff drink.

130
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:55,523
You're right, Mr. Kirby.
t's in the trunk there.

131
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:02,522
Lope tes me you're one of these
archaeoogist feows.

132
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:06,429
We, he's pretty near the mark.
Actuay...

133
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:08,729
...'m a paeontoogist.

134
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:10,997
-We dig deeper.
-My father used to say...

135
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,868
...it is not good to dig up the past.

136
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,709
Let seeping dogs ie, eh?

137
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:18,278
We're not gonna get very far
that way, are we?

138
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:22,508
-That depends on where you want to get to.
-The bottom of things, of course.

139
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,346
What Darwin did with
his theory of evoution...

140
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,921
... intend to do with
my theory of humanoids.

141
00:18:28,157 --> 00:18:30,523
-''Humanoids''?
-t means, ''man-ike.''

142
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:35,694
t's beieved amongst paeontoogists
that man first evoved a miion years ago.

143
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:39,727
intend to prove it was
many eons before that.

144
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:45,636
f you'd ike to ook in that trunk,
you' find a piece of rock. Wi you get it?

145
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:57,114
That's it.

146
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,220
Now ook at the fossi.
The impression eft in the rock.

147
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:06,627
-That ooks ike some sort of footprint.
-Precisey, it's an Eohippus.

148
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,786
-Eo...?
-Eohippus.

149
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:13,526
The so-caed dawn horse.
The ancestor of our present-day horses.

150
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:17,502
never saw a horse sma enough
to eave a print ike that.

151
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,470
Did you notice it had three toes?

152
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:22,610
Over the period of evoution,
horses have grown arger.

153
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:25,576
And that center toe has become
the hoof as we know it.

154
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:31,608
What is more incredibe
is the fossi beside it.

155
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:34,483
am convinced that
is the tibia of some humanoid...

156
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:37,181
...that existed at the same time
as the Eohippus.

157
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,921
Possiby more than 50 miion years ago.

158
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:46,495
-You found this thing around here?
-n the foothis.

159
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:51,628
This is my whoe ife, Mr. Kirby,
but  need time and money.

160
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:55,971
My resources,
both financia and physica...

161
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:59,136
...are running precariousy ow.

162
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:01,874
We, professor, what you

00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,800
Hi there, hon.

-t's about that dea.
-So go!

177
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,105
-You've been thinking about it?
-Nothing has been further from my mind...

178
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:41,909
...with the possibe exception of you.

179
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:55,959
Hey, toro.

180
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:59,828
Hey, toro. Hey, hey, toro.

182
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:06,000
Hey, hey, toro.

183
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:41,032
Tuck!

184
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:46,506
Daring, are you a right?

185
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:56,249
Cut it out, Tuck, if you want me
to get on with the repairs.

186
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,155
You know it's not easy
for me to keep sti with you...

187
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:01,727
...hanging around me ike that.

188
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:05,465
Who was that fea
jumped the bu, anyway?

189
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,829
-Oh, Caros.
-'m gad he was there.

190
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:10,938
-He saved your ife.
-Yeah.

191
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:18,436
Why did you wak out on me, Tuck?
was ready to se out, to marry you.

192
00:23:18,613 --> 00:23:21,173
That's a  ever wanted.

193
00:23:23,118 --> 00:23:25,177
don't know.

194
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,349
know  didn't want to.

195
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:31,754
Getting married is ike
being a horse tied up in a corra.

196
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:35,124
never coud take being
a roped up ike that.

197
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,827
T.J., you know what?

198
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:43,903
just know you're gonna se me Omar.

199
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,676
That's right. You've got a dea.

200
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,210
Wait a minute. What's going on?

201
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,777
Nothing. Anything for you, baby.

202
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:57,481
Don't give me any of that ''baby'' stuff.
What's the pitch?

203
00:23:57,652 --> 00:24:00,587
-Caros brought me a new act.
-What kind of an act?

204
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:06,119
-Stick around. Come to the opening at--
-No, no,  mean now.

205
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:10,663
A right, ' show you tonight.

206
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:14,427
But first the patient must rest,
or he might have a reapse.

207
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:17,333
-And reapses can be fata.
-T.J.,  want to know--

208
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:20,100
Now ie sti.

209
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:23,108
Doesn't it hurt to move?

210
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:26,481
Terribe.

211
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:40,228
Meet E Diabo.

212
00:24:57,112 --> 00:25:00,343
We, if that don't beat a.

213
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:07,077
You want a itte sugar, don't you?

214
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,425
-Where'd you ever get a critter ike that?
-Caros found him.

215
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:19,592
Must have been in a god mine,
because that's what he is. Soid god.

216
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,465
t took a whie to train him, but now
he's about ready for his debut.

217
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:25,833
We, what's the act?

218
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:35,906
We strap a patform onto Omar's back,
and E Diabo watzes on top.

219
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:41,681
A horse dancing on horseback.
That's gonna be a humdinger.

220
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:56,131
can see it a now. Presenting E Diabo,
the word's one and ony miniature horse.

221
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,239
We are on our way to a fortune.

222
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:06,681
-Amazing.
-t's absoutey astounding.

223
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:10,807
Yeah, it was those three toes
that started me thinking.

224
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,457
And four on its hind feet.

225
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:21,458
-Great Scott, it coud be-
-Yeah, an Eo-- What's it?

226
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,622
-Hippus.
-Eohippus. Yes.

227
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:27,902
Eohippus, if you are one...

228
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:34,298
...what are you doing here over 50 miion
years after you shoud be extinct?

229
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,742
t coud be a freak of nature, of course.

230
00:26:40,248 --> 00:26:42,546
We, is there any way you can te?

231
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:45,450
By checking its origin.

232
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,622
f  coud prove that this
is the genuine artice...

233
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,350
... sha undoubtedy
receive a knighthood...

234
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:55,519
...for the greatest scientific
discovery of the age.

235
00:26:56,898 --> 00:27:00,595
The greatest scientific discovery
of the age?

236
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:05,801
-T.J. doesn't know what she's got hersef.
-Sir Horace Bromey.

237
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:07,441
t' ook great in ights.

238
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:12,478
-Gaieo, Newton, Darwin, Bromey.
-Buffao Bi, Barnum and Baiey.

239
00:27:12,647 --> 00:27:14,706
-Bromey.
-Or the Ringing Brothers.

240
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,443
Yes. Yes. We' pay one off
against the other.

241
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:20,645
-Se to the highest bidder. Make them beg.
-Possiby Lord...

242
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:23,655
-We'd make a kiing.
-...Bromey.

243
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:28,189
We must find out where
this itte horse came from.

244
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:31,526
Yes, et's go find this guy Caros.

245
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:39,535
-mpossibe.
-But my dear feow...

246
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:43,769
... have no commercia interest
in E Diabo. 'm a scientist.

247
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:48,348
don't care what you are.
T.J. has given away our secret.

248
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:51,883
-Destroying a my dreams.
-Oh, come now, be reasonabe.

249
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:54,544
Reason is something my peope
do not understand.

250
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:58,625
That witch Tia Zorina tes them
superstitious nonsense about E Diabo.

251
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:01,318
-They beieve it.
-At east show us the camp.

252
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:06,365
don't want any more troube.
You've caused enough aready.

253
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:13,669
-We, thanks for your hep, Caros.
-What hep?

254
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:18,074
''Tia Zorina. Camp.''
We can sure find where that camp is.

255
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:20,214
-How?
-Why, Lope.

256
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:22,748
-Lope?
-Sure. Listen, that kid...

257
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:26,853
...coud find a neede in a haystack
and se it for a profit. 'm not kidding.

258
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:23,768
Madam, 'm prepared to pay
a guide handsomey.

259
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:29,315
To ead you to the Forbidden Vaey?
No. Not for a the god in the word.

260
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:33,420
-What's this Forbidden Vaey?
-From there came the itte horse...

261
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:37,024
...and unti he is returned,
a great evi wi fa upon us.

262
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:40,488
-Rubbish!
- te you, uness the itte horse...

263
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:44,792
...is returned, we sha a
suffer the curse of he.

264
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:49,628
Superstitious captrap. There's nothing
hocus-pocus about that itte horse.

265
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:54,138
Don't you reaize we've discovered
a iving specimen of the Eohippus?

266
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:58,438
-What, that thing reay is an Eohippus?
-Of course.

267
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:04,882
We, naturay we sha have
to prove it by scientific research.

268
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:09,750
We, we aren't getting any scientific
research done here, are we, professor?

269
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:28,432
f you can't hep me,
perhaps  can hep you.

270
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:33,577
f you knew where the itte horse
was hidden, what woud you do?

271
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:37,343
Return it to the Forbidden Vaey.

272
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:43,148
We....

273
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:48,753
A centavo for your thoughts, senor.

274
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:51,290
Oh, hi, Lope.

275
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,501
You ook unhappy, senor.

We,  got a probem, Lope.
've been wresting with it for hours.

277
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:03,099
Sometimes it heps to te an amigo.

278
00:31:04,512 --> 00:31:07,948
We, it's ike this, amigo:
made a big discovery ast night.

279
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,051
f  te this friend about it,
it coud hep her a ot.

280
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:12,948
She coud make a fortune.

281
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:17,120
But if she makes a fortune
it might not hep me.

282
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:21,292
can't figure out why 'm trying
to hep a friend make a fortune...

283
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:25,865
...when a  gotta do is be quiet

284
00:31:26,034 --> 00:31:28,229
-Savvy?

-Love.

286
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,804
No! Love's for Latins.

287
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,239
When my mama was aive
she used to te me:

288
00:31:36,411 --> 00:31:40,541
''Lope, when you hep someone
you ove you hep yoursef.''

289
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:45,311
Here, limonada, for free advice.

290
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:49,485
You sure do know how
to hep yoursef, Lope.

291
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,522
What's the big discovery, senor?

292
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:54,161
Oh, no, no, no.
You' end up wanting a cut.

293
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,024
Why? 'm doing fine on my own.

294
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:58,461

-Sorry, senor?

00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,730
-With the professor.
-With the professor?

297
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:09,835
must meet him tonight with the mue,
outside the arena.

298
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,504
We, that's it, amigo.
No more figuring.

299
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:18,880
got the feeing that certain friend of mine
is in need of some hep right now.

300
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,173
Come on, come on!

301
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:54,473
-Hey, Tuck!
-Tuck, what's the hurry?

302
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,783

305
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,033
Come on, chico,
we mustn't ose them.

306
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,703
What happened?

307
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:24,811
-He hit me.
-Who?

308
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,243
-Your friend, Kirby.
-What?

309
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:30,145

steaing E Diabo.

310
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:35,153
-Steaing?! Why, the dirty--
-No, no. Not Tuck.

311
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:39,987
-We just saw him with our own eyes.
-He's no good, T.J.

312
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:42,662
Champ, get Bean and Rowdy.

313
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,162
You bet.

314
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,608
Whoa!

315
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,713
Come on!

316
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,479
Look here.

317
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:19,717
Tuck's got company.
We're headed in the right direction.

318
00:36:19,894 --> 00:36:23,830
He's working with the professor.
They were speaking of scientific interest.

319
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:27,934
Scientific interest, my eye!
Tuck wants E Diabo for Buffao Bi.

320
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:31,162
-You shoud have istened to me, T.J.
-He's right, T.J.

321
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:32,863
That Tuck is the owest.

322
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,009
A right, a right!
He was right.  was wrong.

323
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:40,113
-But if we stand here we' never catch him.
- know where they're heading.

324
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,044
-There's a shortcut.
-To where?

325
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:44,684
Forbidden Vaey.

326
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:40,396
Hep!

327
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:42,735
Now, professor,
where's that itte horse?

328
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:46,402
- don't know.
-You don't know?

329
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,710
Sir Horace, when your king finds out
you're a ow-down horse thief...

330
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:55,413
...he' give you a touch of the sword,
a right. Yeah, just about there.

331
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,217
You're gonna te me where E Diabo is.

332
00:37:58,392 --> 00:38:01,259
You can make it easy or hard.
That's up to you.

333
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:05,593
-We, the gypsies took him.
-You put them up to it.

334
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:09,065
We, yes, in a way,
but it's going to benefit a of us.

335
00:38:09,236 --> 00:38:10,760
Oh, now, is that a fact?

336
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:14,738
-E Diabo--
-s the property of Miss T.J. Breckenridge!

337
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,272
'm protecting her interests.

338
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:19,936
We, so am .

339
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:25,450
Don't you see, we must foow
the gypsy trai to the Forbidden Vaey.

340
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,247
Where there is one Eohippus,
there must be others.

341
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:32,058
At east two, the sire and the mare.

342
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:34,890
Possiby more.

343
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,297
Just think what you
and Miss Breckenridge coud do...

344
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:42,562
...with a dozen Eohippi.

345
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,068
From now on we're partners?

346
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:52,470
Oh, no, professor.  make it a rue never
to shake hands with an anxious man.

347
00:38:52,646 --> 00:38:54,807
' join you, but no deas.

348
00:38:54,982 --> 00:38:58,748
-Senor Kirby!
-Hey, hi there, Lope.

349
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,320

350
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:06,927
-One peso. To you, haf.
-Okay.

351
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,673
Fy, itte one. Fy home to your master.

352
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:51,471
This circe of mountains,
jagged peaks, deep ciffs...

353
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,473
...coud be the perfect barrier
against man and the eements.

354
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,370
Huh, no wonder they ca it
the Forbidden Vaey.

355
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:00,309
Yes.

356
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,415
Might be the answer to many things.

357
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,814
Like what?

358
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:08,045
We sha soon see, Mr. Kirby.

359
00:40:08,556 --> 00:40:11,855
We' camp here tonight,

360
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,492

361
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,723
Quick, the horses!

362
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,733
-Where's Rosita?
-Senor Kirby, professor, ook!

363
00:40:39,086 --> 00:40:41,520
There's bood a around.

364
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:53,692
Ho! Ho, boy, ho!

365
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:05,209
Yeah, the gypsies stopped here,

366
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,371
Senor Kirby! Professor!

367
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,791
Now, how'd they get here?

368
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:27,729
was afraid of something ike this.

369
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,060
Champ,  just caught mysef
a horse thief.

370
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:35,072
Now hod on, T.J. You don't think
had anything to do with that?

371
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,643
Look, the Eohippus!

372
00:41:41,815 --> 00:41:45,251
Easy. Easy. Steady.

373
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,956
No, that's no good.
Let's chase him on horseback.

374
00:42:00,134 --> 00:42:01,931
Go get him.

375
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,962
-Hey, need any hep?
-Not from you.

376
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,975

-Take your thieving hands off him.

377
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,874
He's mine.

378
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:49,982
Whatever you say, T.J.

379
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,985
Tuck Kirby,  coud shoot you.

380
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,490
Keep after him, Champ.

381
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,110
Hey, we got him cornered.

382
00:43:22,283 --> 00:43:24,513

384
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,260
He must have gone cear through.

385
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:39,593
-Yeah, we, that's that because we're not.
-Looks ike the end of the road.

386
00:44:14,468 --> 00:44:16,993
t opens into another whoe vaey
through there.

387
00:44:17,171 --> 00:44:20,231
Wider inside. Wide enough
for the horses.

388
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:23,609
Take up the sack easy.

389
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:33,486
Take her away.

390
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,824
Okay, that did it!

391
00:44:53,006 --> 00:44:55,167
Come on, boys.

392
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,499
Now, ain't that something?!

393
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,160
Man, oh, man!

394
00:46:38,946 --> 00:46:40,937

395
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:19,205

-Oh, it's beautifu.

404
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:50,694
-What kind of bird is it, professor?
-Oh, no bird.

405
00:50:50,864 --> 00:50:53,628
A giant pterodacty, a fying reptie.

406
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,133
t's been extinct
for over 50 miion years.

407
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,636
Then what's it doing here?

408
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,206
Precisey.

409
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:05,037
What is it doing here?

410
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,873
-Where are the others?
-There!

411
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,813
Let's get out of here!

412
00:51:13,553 --> 00:51:15,714
Gwangi.

413
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,150
-Take off, T.J.
-Lope's hurt.

414
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,058
Can you ride? Get on a horse, boy!

415
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:27,667
-Come on, professor. No time for that.
- can't go now.

416
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:31,099
There's a big izard back there,
heading this way. Get aboard.

417
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:34,604
Leave me aone, Mr. Kirby.
'm not eaving now.

418
00:51:34,775 --> 00:51:36,743
Come on, Tuck.

419
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:39,845
Okay, professor, it's your funera.

420
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,252

426
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,259
-Let's get up there.
-What about the professor?

427
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:44,761
Nothing we can do for him now.
Just hope he's sti aive.

428
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,947
Rowdy, you must be pumb loco.

-Now what'd  do?
-Come here.

430
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:12,449
These cartridges are banks.
They're the banks we use in the show.

431
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:15,219
No wonder the rifes didn't do any good.

432
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,956
How was  to know? You expect
to wake a fea ready for a shootout?

433
00:55:19,132 --> 00:55:20,793
Hey, forget it.

434
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:22,901
Here, maybe we can use these.

435
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:28,063
-See if you can cut that into a spear.
- don't take orders from no horse thief.

436
00:55:31,811 --> 00:55:35,338
A right, now te me, just what
do you mean, a horse thief?

437
00:55:35,515 --> 00:55:36,743

Caros said you did it.

442
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,664
Caros?

443
00:55:53,299 --> 00:55:56,826
You never did bring anything

What are you doing out of the cave?
You wanna get yoursef kied?

451
00:56:27,934 --> 00:56:30,027

00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:34,471
-What's that for?
-We, it's a trap.

453
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:38,805
n case one of those itte izards
decides to mosey up this way.

454
00:56:40,046 --> 00:56:43,379
A hoe in the ground
coud swaow me up too.

455
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:47,884
You can't te a friend from an enemy,
cockeyed femae.

456
00:56:51,558 --> 00:56:54,152
Don't they seep nights?

Tuck,  don't care.
Don't you understand?

Keep those horses steady!

513
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:10,225
Tuck, Caros!

514
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:28,376
Can't get through here!
Go back to the professor.

515
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:51,605
There's no way through!
There's no way through!

516
01:08:51,775 --> 01:08:54,073
We gotta go back!

517
01:11:39,742 --> 01:11:42,438
We're gonna ug this critter back aive!

518
01:11:42,612 --> 01:11:48,050
T.J., honey, you're gonna have the greatest
main attraction that any circus--

519
01:11:49,652 --> 01:11:51,483
What's the matter?

520
01:11:55,592 --> 01:11:57,253
Where's Caros?

521
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:29,607
Champ!

522
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:46,931
t is as  foretod.

523
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:52,540
Gwangi has kied Caros
just as he kied his brother Migue.

524
01:13:53,076 --> 01:13:56,375
-We, how'd you know that?
-n a dream,  saw it.

525
01:13:56,546 --> 01:14:01,313
The great jaws snapping,
the rideress horse. He was doomed.

526
01:14:01,484 --> 01:14:04,282
And so wi you be doomed,
a of you...

527
01:14:04,454 --> 01:14:06,752
...uness the evi one is set free!

528
01:14:06,956 --> 01:14:12,417
Baderdash, my good woman, baderdash!
He's no more evi than an aigator.

529
01:14:12,862 --> 01:14:16,093
The ony thing that's evi about him
are his jaws.

530
01:14:16,265 --> 01:14:19,928
Spes? He can cast no spes!

531
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:23,637
A right, come on, et's move out.

532
01:14:28,277 --> 01:14:31,178
Defy the aw and perish!

533
01:15:19,695 --> 01:15:23,722
n the name of word science,
beg you,  impore you, to think again.

534
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:29,532
-Later. We've got a show to put on.
-A show! A show?

535
01:15:29,705 --> 01:15:35,803
But it's disgracefu to think of putting
this creature on dispay in a cheap circus!

536
01:15:35,978 --> 01:15:39,971
-We can do what we ike. He's our property.
-He beongs to us a, to mankind.

537
01:15:40,149 --> 01:15:42,515
-To scientific research!
-Easy, professor.

538
01:15:42,685 --> 01:15:47,816
You can do your research in the time
we give you. Foow us on our word tour!

539
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:52,552
You must be mad, raving mad.
Word tour!

540
01:15:52,728 --> 01:15:56,186
We' see what the Roya Society
has to say about this.

541
01:15:58,801 --> 01:16:01,998
-What's this about a word tour?
-'ve got it a figured out.

542
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:05,299
-We pay London, Paris, Madrid, and--
-Wait a minute.

543
01:16:05,475 --> 01:16:08,410
-Forgetting something, aren't you?
-Oh, yes, New York.

544
01:16:08,578 --> 01:16:11,672
No, not New York, Wyoming!
That ranch!

545
01:16:11,848 --> 01:16:14,874
-We taked about it, remember?
-Yes, but that was before.

546
01:16:15,051 --> 01:16:17,952
Look, T.J., this show was going to be it.

547
01:16:18,121 --> 01:16:22,524
The reason  heped you was so that
a of you coud get paid off handsome.

548
01:16:22,692 --> 01:16:26,560
-From a show that's reay worth buying.
-But now it's worth saving.

549
01:16:26,729 --> 01:16:29,926
Tuck, can't you see?
We can do the tour, then buy the ranch.

550
01:16:30,099 --> 01:16:33,227
No. No, we can't.
Not you and me. Not now.

551
01:16:33,402 --> 01:16:38,169
-Same od Tuck.
-Oh, no, not the same od Tuck!

552
01:16:38,341 --> 01:16:41,777
But a new kind of T.J.,
suddeny caught up in a word of gitter.

553
01:16:41,944 --> 01:16:45,345
Leave me out. That dreamboat's
on the rocks before it sais.

554
01:16:45,515 --> 01:16:47,642
As you ike.

555
01:16:48,618 --> 01:16:50,745
As you ike?!

556
01:16:51,621 --> 01:16:55,455
-We, that's it.

557
01:16:58,561 --> 01:17:00,358
Figures.

558
01:17:00,897 --> 01:17:04,458
We, 'm sorry for you.
You're heading for a pace  just eft.

don't think you're gonna ike it much.

560
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,508
Senorita, you must go after Mr. Kirby.

561
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:21,616
He's a very proud man
and he' never come back.

562
01:18:12,435 --> 01:18:13,959

563
01:19:42,758 --> 01:19:44,350
