1
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:31,281
AMALGAMATION AND CAPITAL

2
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:39,778
- Good morning, William..
- Good morning, M. Bullock.

3
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:41,806
Are you sometimes permitted coffee?

4
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:45,357
About a third of a cup?

5
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:47,791
Completed with cow’s milk.

6
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,705
As to sugar,

7
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,514
three spoons?

8
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,319
Is this the morning, William, do you suppose,

9
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:01,865
the tip of this lamp,
like a Indian spear,

10
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,397
goes into the top of my head?

11
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:07,107
I don’t know, Sir.

12
00:02:14,983 --> 00:02:17,067
Does it stand comparison
with your mother’s?

13
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:22,230
Stiffened with a further
lace of sugar?

14
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,260
I mean that he would make it,
Sir—my father would.

15
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,586
Do you have time to sit a bit?

16
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,763
I suppose I might do, having chopped
the kindling last evening.

17
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:52,356
Why don’t you tell me
about your father, William?

18
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,075
I didn’t know my brother so well
as you had a chance to.

19
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:58,361
I was nine when Robert left our home.

20
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,955
I think you knew him longer.
You were 11.

21
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,748
I knew him pretty well.

22
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,575
What did he like doin’ best?

23
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,676
Sometimes he’d sing.

24
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:17,601
Not army songs, but other kinds.

25
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:19,525
He would make mother laugh.

26
00:03:21,813 --> 00:03:23,936
He made the best duck calls of anyone.

27
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:25,832
He would send away through the wood,

28
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,248
and he taught me comebacks,

29
00:03:28,436 --> 00:03:30,016
and feeder calls and hails.

30
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:43,422
Mr. Utter and I have some camp
bidness to see to.

31
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:46,771
William,

32
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:49,860
are you a good duck caller?

33
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:52,609
I suppose I’m pretty good.
I could show you, Sir.

34
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:57,178
I know of some potholes over Belle Fourche
way that are pretty good for ducks.

35
00:04:03,307 --> 00:04:05,106
Goodbye, Mr. Bullock.

36
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:15,384
E.B. Farnum, Al.

37
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:17,433
Come in, E.B.

38
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:22,577
I’ve been prostrated
by the agonies of the damned.

39
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:26,275
Judgment is upon us then.

40
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:28,792
A molar rotted through.

41
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:31,548
Distressing me also,
that you are my eyes and ears

42
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:34,762
and a day as eventful as yesterday
should find you indisposed.

43
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:39,038
Some solace in knowing I’m missed.

44
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:42,373
You missed the advent of the
fucking telegraph operator

45
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:45,885
that had you steered into one of your rooms,
you could have kept tabs on henceforth.

46
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:47,163
The pain nearly killed me.

47
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,069
As you still breathe amongst us,

48
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,603
I shall ask you to befriend this fuckin’ Russian.

49
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,388
- Russian?
- The fucking telegraph operator, E.B.,

50
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,238
is a fuckin’ Russian.

51
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:02,057
Of course I’ll befriend him.
I’m very fond of Russians.

52
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,410
And as the trust between you deepens,

53
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:06,991
we’ll be particularly interested in messages

54
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:09,424
to and from Yankton.

55
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:13,591
Yeah? Sorry, E.B.

56
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:17,542
Al, you might wanna take
a gander at that.

57
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:18,886
E.B. is leaving.

58
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,866
You won’t miss him.

59
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:23,793
He’s livin’ at Merrick’s and looks
like the prize at a carnival.

60
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:26,866
What a delightful image
to carry away with me!

61
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:42,692
Swearengen’s put the paper man’s boat to sea

62
00:05:42,938 --> 00:05:45,322
with a hold full of fuckin’ bullshit.

63
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:50,106
He wants 5,000 more upstairs.

64
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:56,784
Tell that fat bastard he can come
down and get it hisself!

65
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:59,284
He says it’s 100 if I bring it up.

66
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:02,265
Is the 5 you already brought him
in any kinda action, Tess?

67
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:05,516
It’s just for him to look at
while he fucks ya!

68
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:06,893
So,

69
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:11,297
do I want my $8.00, Tess,
of the $9.00 he pays for the fuck,

70
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:14,347
and my 90 of the 100 he gives you
to bring it up to him,

71
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:17,051
or do I want to give
fat boy the opportunity,

72
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:19,603
if he has to come down
to get the other five,

73
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:24,165
to test his luck on the floor here
amongst the games of chance?

74
00:06:24,603 --> 00:06:27,490
- I see.
- And don’t mistake me, honey,

75
00:06:27,736 --> 00:06:30,955
I want to take the time
to explain myself to you.

76
00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:34,409
We’ve come to see Mose Manuel
about his brother gettin’ shot.

77
00:06:38,243 --> 00:06:40,356
Fetch Mose Manual, Tess.

78
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,935
Tell him Sheriff Bullock wants to pay his condolences

79
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:47,589
here amongst the games of chance.

80
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:58,829
All these rumors, sheriff,
swirling around you...

81
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:01,458
How do you keep your hat on?

82
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:03,863
If you’ll sign right here, Ma’am.

83
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:06,542
And give us a “A.G.” in the corner.

84
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:09,719
Is that abbreviation

85
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:12,000
Is that abbreviation a term of art
in financial transactions?

86
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:14,678
Ought I acquaint myself with its meaning?

87
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:17,922
That abbreviation, Ma’am, is your initials.

88
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,744
And by asking the whereabouts of
the currency I signed for receiving,

89
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:28,512
do I reveal an even deeper stupidity?

90
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:31,456
The coach from Denver
should get in today.

91
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:36,216
And the safe we’ve purchased?
To be housed in the bank we’re to build?

92
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,383
It’s inside the coach; as well.

93
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:41,777
Safe’s inside the coach and
the currency is inside the safe

94
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:43,462
is the full picture.

95
00:07:44,244 --> 00:07:46,478
There, I did manage to be stupid.

96
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,034
And you will see to the
safe’s temporary situation

97
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:53,936
at the Star & Bullock hardware store?

98
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:58,880
Gaze averted from the awkwardness
such a situation generates.

99
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,610
Fixin’ my eyes instead on its

100
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:03,303
pluses securing your money.

101
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:06,226
Excellent then, Mr. Ellsworth.

102
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:11,743
May I further impose on you
to convey this letter?

103
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,032
Of course.

104
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:15,640
Mr. Swearengen?

105
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:17,384
Please.

106
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:22,592
All right.  Is there anything else for us to discuss?

107
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,065
Not at this time.

108
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:29,979
I’ll be goin’ then.

109
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,369
Who’s that?

110
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:45,205
It’s Joanie Stubbs.

111
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,105
You’re outside my place.

112
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:52,826
Keepin’ half-assed vigil after the fact.

113
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:55,145
Well, come in and tell
me what you mean.

114
00:08:58,421 --> 00:08:59,430
Nah, that’s all right.

115
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,762
Uh, that cocksucker you spoke to me of

116
00:09:05,006 --> 00:09:07,910
come from here last night with a bloody fucking mug.

117
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:10,253
- I gave it to him.
- Good.

118
00:09:14,571 --> 00:09:16,230
Ahhh…anyways, he told me…

119
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:18,133
at rifle point

120
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:20,403
you was okay.

121
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:22,395
- I am.
- I knew.

122
00:09:23,282 --> 00:09:24,962
if he was lying you was dead

123
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:28,260
if he was lying you was dead and
feared finding you so in the darkness.

124
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,944
Scared that way since I was small.

125
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:32,834
Well, come on in, Jane.

126
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:39,388
If you was alive -
why fuckin’ knock was my thinkin’.

127
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:43,759
Interfere with you gettin’ to sleep
or - bein’ asleep already -

128
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:46,570
- Jane, it’s nippy on my twat.
- Alright, then, see you later!

129
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,448
Do you remember you were
in here yesterday?

130
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,413
- Yes, I fuckin’ remember.
- Well, why not come in again?

131
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,865
Maybe I just fuckin’ might.

132
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:03,757
Nigger General’s got a wild horse on his hands.

133
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,751
I pity the brute beast

134
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:11,397
I pity the brute beast who pits
his cunning against the Nigger Generals!

135
00:10:15,526 --> 00:10:17,587
We can catch the cavalry
before they head south...

136
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:19,599
and sell him for $100!

137
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:21,568
But they want their horses cut!

138
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:22,769
Where’d you catch him?

139
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:25,764
I sprung a rope fence behind
him in a box canyon.

140
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:27,381
He’d escaped the Sioux

141
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:30,506
but his path crossed an in-season mare’s.

142
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:33,698
Now, now I can nut him,

143
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:36,213
but the moon is wrong,
and he’s gonna take it badly.

144
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:39,910
Fuck, I ain’t losing my chance
at 100 waiting on no fucking moon!

145
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:42,710
Okay.  Don’t put your ass on me.

146
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,793
Wash him so he won’t fester.

147
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:49,769
Hey, I got him

148
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:52,209
All right.  Come here, boy,
come here..

149
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:55,148
Now, if you want to take it out on someone,
remember

150
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:58,794
it was very dark-skinned
white folks that cut on you.

151
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:01,097
They just sounded like
niggers to throw you off.

152
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,392
This one’s a “D.”

153
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:08,131
And this one’s a “G.”
And what’s the first one?

154
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:10,070
"D" ?

155
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:12,534
“Sheriff Bullock declines comment...

156
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,630
...on the swirls of rumors
that parties in Helena...

157
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:17,901
...with whom he has had long association...

158
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,166
...are keenly interested in annexing...

159
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:22,871
... our camp to the Montana territories.

160
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,882
‘The Pioneer’ also learns of interest more developed...

161
00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:28,337
...and advanced...

162
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:29,718
...on the part of Wyoming.”

163
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,897
You knew Cheyenne would
be heard from.

164
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:34,133
Get the fuck up off them steps!

165
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:37,968
Here’s where it gets
really fuckin’ busy.

166
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:42,577
“And of an offer secretly proffered by
certain elements in Washington D.C. ..."

167
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:44,065
"...to annex to America..."

168
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,968
"...these our beloved hills as a
separate free-standing territory,..."

169
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,398
"...with an eye towards
eventual statehood.”

170
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:51,968
Makin’ Deadwood fuckin’ headquarters!

171
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:54,039
Don’t spread your legs
for them just yet, Johnny.

172
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:57,171
Not with Mexico to be heard from and fucking France.

173
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:07,973
There.  100 extra copies,
gentlemen, to satisfy

174
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:11,809
the widened interest I expect
today’s edition may generate.

175
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,011
Wonderful, eh, Mr. Blazanov?

176
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,098
100 copies extra.

177
00:12:17,522 --> 00:12:20,714
Shall we walk a bit, my American
and Russian friends?

178
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:22,187
Shall we?

179
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:25,343
I can’t leave my apparatus.

180
00:12:25,514 --> 00:12:27,606
Are not all of us,
Mr. Blazanov,

181
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,878
tethered in some sense
to our labors?

182
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,940
And at some point in our lives,

183
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:34,569
is not acceptance

184
00:12:34,882 --> 00:12:37,520
of that tethering discovery of a path to joy?

185
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:40,071
Don’t know, Mr. Merrick.

186
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,531
And does not the very knowing
we are tethered allow us

187
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:44,244
in conscience upon occasion,

188
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:46,830
the rejuvenating pleasures of respite?

189
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,087
Take your walk alone, A.W.,

190
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:51,034
for I confess

191
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:54,003
I’m mesmerized by
Mr. Blazanov’s machine

192
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:57,424
and hope he may explain its workings.

193
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,046
Has Al seen “The Pioneer”?

194
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:02,505
I don’t know. A mystery
you should seek to solve.

195
00:13:05,704 --> 00:13:07,822
- Good day.
- Good day, Miss.

196
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:10,480
A.W. Merrick of
“The Deadwood Pioneer.”

197
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:12,728
- I wish to send a telegram.
- A telegram, yes,

198
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,439
of course.  Then that’s
Mr. Blazanov there you seek.

199
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:19,529
How do you do?

200
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:22,445
Blazanov, Cheyenne and
Black Hills telegraph company.

201
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:23,421
How do you do?

202
00:13:23,612 --> 00:13:25,423
- Miss Isringhausen.
- Mr. Farnum.

203
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:28,667
- I wish this message sent.
- Oh, of course.

204
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,590
I have a form for
you to write on.

205
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:32,902
Please.

206
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:44,138
You seem uncowed

207
00:13:44,498 --> 00:13:46,548
by Mr. Blazanov’s apparatus.

208
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:48,890
Are you initiate in its mysteries?

209
00:13:49,158 --> 00:13:50,257
Fuck off.

210
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:54,038
Gentlemen!

211
00:13:58,539 --> 00:13:59,858
Oh, Jeez! Ah, what news?

212
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,368
This ink-stained wretch has just
produced an overrun of 100 copies!

213
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,413
Dan, don’t you agree that the truth,

214
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:09,891
f only a pinch, must season every falsehood,

215
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:11,784
or the palate fuckin’ rebels?

216
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:14,468
And mustn’t the novice chef be mindful

217
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:17,904
not to ladle out his concoction
by the unseasoned fucking ton,

218
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:21,796
lest before he perfect his art,
he lose his clientele?

219
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:31,935
I’d like the ball scores
a little more fuckin’ prompt.

220
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:34,467
Excuse me.

221
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:42,232
Al Swearengen, I would not go
into that office if I were you.

222
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:44,197
Were you fuckin’ born yesterday?

223
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:47,482
No, Sir, I was not.
I was not born yesterday!

224
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:51,022
Then may we please have
a conversation as fuckin’ adults?

225
00:14:51,242 --> 00:14:53,331
I think we’d better!

226
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:10,196
I ain’t waitin’.

227
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:12,469
Give this to him.

228
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:14,444
Tell him whatever its import,

229
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:16,956
he’d best not serve the sender ill.

230
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,151
He’s in with Merrick, E.B.

231
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:29,884
I bear news that don’t wanna wait.

232
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:33,660
Every rumor you floated

233
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,793
in your article, Merrick, I believe
is a living possibility for this camp,

234
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:39,276
and I want you to fuckin’ hear
that as a compliment.

235
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:42,840
- If so, it’s the first from your lips.
- Because all them possibilities

236
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:45,634
called next to accomplished
fact in one fuckin’ outgush

237
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:47,979
makes people smell a rat.

238
00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:51,658
Yes, I suppose so.

239
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:55,128
These interests comin’ after us,
Merrick, they’re fuckin’ rough.

240
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:56,764
They’re going after our nuts.

241
00:15:57,105 --> 00:16:00,235
They’re hypocrite cocksuckers,

242
00:16:00,478 --> 00:16:03,133
and the fuckin’ lyin’ tactics
and instruments they use

243
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:06,520
to fuck people up the ass
can be turned against them.

244
00:16:07,018 --> 00:16:09,065
My newspaper being
such an instrument.

245
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:10,294
But scale,

246
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:11,539
amount,

247
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:13,546
proportion, seasonin’.

248
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:16,138
Drink that fuckin’
second shot, Merrick!

249
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:17,551
I like my fuckin’ liquor.

250
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:20,084
A trait in you that
gave me early hope.

251
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,418
I like stinkin’ of fuckin’ ink too.

252
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:24,868
- Give it a fuckin’ smell, Al.
- No.

253
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:26,407
So you enjoyed

254
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:28,538
writin’ your fuckin’ article, huh?

255
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:32,455
Worse ways to spend a night,
puttin’ shoulder to a fuckin’ idea.

256
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:34,808
Evidently, I put mine to overmany.

257
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,945
Pursued down overmany avenues.

258
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:42,144
The camp’s welfare was the main idea.

259
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:49,453
Al!  Something strange has
transpired I need you to construe.

260
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,367
What?

261
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:53,762
- As I was befriending...
- Come in!

262
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,370
As I was befriending
the Russian operator,

263
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:03,147
that woman tutor
came to send a telegram.

264
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:05,048
We jockeyed a bit

265
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:07,767
as I sought a glance at its contents,

266
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:09,820
and finally, she shouted

267
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,200
in so many words

268
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,138
- and here is the strangeness in a tutor,

269
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:16,761
to get the fuck away from her.

270
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:20,137
Since the private part of this
meetin’s over... Ellsworth brung it.

271
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:22,808
... In so many words.

272
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,778
- Where’s the tutor now?
- Still with the operator,

273
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,194
apparently waiting for
an answer to her message.

274
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:31,797
Leave by the front entrance, huh?

275
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:35,357
Walk around for a few minutes
before you go back to your place.

276
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,082
Bring that tutor up here.

277
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:52,946
The Russian too.

278
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:55,904
It felt like something
you’d want to construe.

279
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:57,083
Go away, E.B.

280
00:17:58,927 --> 00:17:59,949
All right. Certainly.

281
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:40,534
It’s the seeds from the sunflower
we had in Fort Quitman,

282
00:18:40,975 --> 00:18:43,019
which I had in a jar which broke

283
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:46,683
broke and mice ate most of.
So now I only have these three.

284
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:49,176
I didn’t know you brought them.

285
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:53,356
Mr. Bullock’s been missing father.
I talked to him about it this morning.

286
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:57,273
As Papa like the sunflower,

287
00:18:57,577 --> 00:18:59,302
I thought Mr. Bullock might as well.

288
00:19:02,062 --> 00:19:04,048
Then shall we plant those together?

289
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:06,303
Press the soil firmly on them,

290
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:08,503
while I get the watering can.

291
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:22,724
Maybe we should take
Mr. Bullock lunch at his store.

292
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:29,707
An accident befell my brother
is the sum of what I know,

293
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:32,387
and be glad I choose to say it.

294
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:37,128
Gutshot, at Nuttall’s No. 10
by his own hand?

295
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,200
Correct.

296
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:42,867
The day you sell out the claim
you two were partnered on?

297
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:46,318
Correct, and fuck yourself,

298
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,466
and don’t act entitled

299
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:49,793
to answers.

300
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:51,861
Why was Charlie handlin’ the gun?

301
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,783
Fuck yourself,
and don’t act entitled.

302
00:19:56,356 --> 00:19:58,715
Why weren’t you two
watchin’ Nuttall’s bike ride?

303
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:03,918
Fuck yourself.

304
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:06,555
I want to see his gun and his remains.

305
00:20:07,178 --> 00:20:08,586
Where is Charlie buried?

306
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:10,633
My brother

307
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:14,883
is buried in a secret burial place

308
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:18,679
by his own private instructions!

309
00:20:18,894 --> 00:20:20,620
Jesus Christ, Bullock!

310
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,975
- Put together a court or don’t!
- Quiet, you!

311
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:25,528
Don’t hush me in my
own fucking joint.

312
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:27,541
And if we take it outside, old man,

313
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:30,496
expect a different outcome
from the other fuckin’ day.

314
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:32,511
You best have 5 of your
fuckin’ cappers then with,

315
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:34,909
rifles at the ready.

316
00:20:35,143 --> 00:20:37,776
I got 5 and 5 behind them,
indoors or out.

317
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:40,502
I too must report
to the Sheriff a death,

318
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:42,813
a Cornishman at theft has been shot

319
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:44,500
in Mr. Hearst’s claim.

320
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,659
Killed?

321
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:47,209
Yes, in flight.

322
00:20:47,928 --> 00:20:50,566
It’s all fuckin’ amalgamation
and capital, ain’t it, Wolcott?

323
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,166
Mr. Utter, are you a student of Hume?

324
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:54,902
Smith?

325
00:20:55,446 --> 00:20:56,813
A disciple of Karl Marx?

326
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:58,213
Come on, Charlie.

327
00:20:58,432 --> 00:21:01,497
My employer, Mr. Hearst, has interests
and connections in Montana, Sheriff,

328
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,978
as are imputed to you
in this morning´s “Pioneer.”

329
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:05,328
You shut your fucking mouth!

330
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:07,212
- Get him out of here!
- Down, Charlie !

331
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:08,708
Sure got to you, didn’t he, Mose?

332
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,384
Now he’s got to get you to die!

333
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:20,333
Let me, uh…

334
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:23,556
get my arm through here

335
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:25,973
so I can secure my toast.

336
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:30,992
You’re gonna lift me
one time too fuckin’ many!

337
00:21:31,216 --> 00:21:33,554
You don’t go back in there if I let you go.

338
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:40,246
-  I’m leavin’ the whole fuckin’ camp!
- Going where?

339
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:44,231
A letter come to hand
I need to take to Bill’s missus.

340
00:21:44,495 --> 00:21:45,551
Excuse me.

341
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,282
Excuse me. Camp bidness.

342
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:49,892
He wrote

343
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:52,051
- just before he got killed.
- I see.

344
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:55,594
And you know who fuckin’ give it to me?
How crazy life got?

345
00:21:56,266 --> 00:21:59,204
And money must buy these bastards
any-fuckin’g-thing they want!

346
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:03,875
That cocksucker inside,
Mr. Amalgamation and fuckin’ capital!

347
00:22:04,305 --> 00:22:06,486
Hearst’s geologist
gave you the letter?

348
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,006
And God knows

349
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:12,610
who he fuckin’ bought it offa…

350
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:16,164
or how many hands it passed through.

351
00:22:16,373 --> 00:22:18,030
It fucks me up thinking Bill’s missus

352
00:22:18,157 --> 00:22:20,295
got to handle something
that cocksucker touched.

353
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:23,457
Was it over the letter
you beat him the other day?

354
00:22:25,731 --> 00:22:26,537
No no. Excuse me.

355
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:31,342
No, I give my word not—
not to say what that was over.

356
00:22:32,578 --> 00:22:34,666
I’d best go, lest

357
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:38,414
Mr. Amalgamation and capital takes
one through the fucking head.

358
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,471
What’s the import of that expression?

359
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:43,720
Do I look like I fuckin’ know?

360
00:22:47,052 --> 00:22:50,071
Some big-shot eastern magazine
reporter interviewin’ Bill

361
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,391
said that was what’s
changing things around.

362
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,478
Jane.  I don’t know what’s
gonna come of fuckin’ Jane.

363
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,059
I’ll keep an eye on her.

364
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:02,362
You should lock her in that cell
and don’t let her fuckin’ drink!

365
00:23:04,148 --> 00:23:06,193
And don’t fuck yourself up
over Mose Manuel.

366
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:08,098
He’ll get hisself fleeced

367
00:23:08,358 --> 00:23:10,522
of what is rightfully his

368
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,652
and what he got by fuckin’ murder.

369
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:15,899
He’ll be judge on hisself and jury too.
Just like the fuckin’ most of us.

370
00:23:19,174 --> 00:23:20,546
Coach from Denver.

371
00:23:24,064 --> 00:23:25,112
Here’s yours.

372
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:33,187
Good luck, Charlie.

373
00:23:41,674 --> 00:23:44,469
We’ve brought you and Mr. Star lunch.

374
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:19,053
Thank you.

375
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,069
- I’m up!
- You want the bath?

376
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,298
I may well get to that.

377
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:34,253
- Ample here, ain’t it?
- Yeah.

378
00:24:34,498 --> 00:24:36,708
Uh, formerly a cooperage.

379
00:24:37,206 --> 00:24:38,894
My friend Eddie that bought him out

380
00:24:39,084 --> 00:24:41,638
said the man had been
a season ahead of himself.

381
00:24:43,111 --> 00:24:45,639
Well, lovely as it’s fixed
as a brothel,

382
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:48,973
I expect you will reopen soon enough,

383
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:51,885
Restock and reopen.

384
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:55,076
You’d think so, wouldn’t ya?

385
00:25:09,828 --> 00:25:11,251
Stay awhile, Jane.

386
00:25:12,486 --> 00:25:13,696
Be my guest.

387
00:25:14,855 --> 00:25:16,164
Or favor me and stay.

388
00:25:23,494 --> 00:25:25,300
I get top fuckin’ dollar.

389
00:25:41,146 --> 00:25:43,294
New saloon in the camp, Jane?

390
00:25:44,123 --> 00:25:46,723
I know that’s some clever opening gambit

391
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:49,372
to culminate in breaking my balls.

392
00:25:50,648 --> 00:25:53,050
Just sayin’ I checked the usual spots

393
00:25:53,226 --> 00:25:55,890
‘cause I wanted to say goodbye
before I left camp,

394
00:25:56,106 --> 00:25:58,634
so incase you go ahead and fucking die...

395
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:00,869
Goodbye, Charlie, goodbye.

396
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,636
Have a good fuckin’ trip.

397
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:04,281
Shut the fuck up.

398
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:09,126
‘Cause it so happens when you return,

399
00:26:09,893 --> 00:26:12,509
if no trees or animals killed you,

400
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:15,306
that you were fucking
driving crazy with criticism

401
00:26:15,547 --> 00:26:17,981
you will find I’ve moved
out of this shitbox

402
00:26:18,524 --> 00:26:22,255
so I don’t have to fucking
embarrass you or fucking have you

403
00:26:22,476 --> 00:26:25,662
hovering over me like the ugliest
fucking nurse in the fucking universe.

404
00:26:31,432 --> 00:26:32,192
Into where?

405
00:26:32,701 --> 00:26:34,025
Into where what?

406
00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:37,824
Into where are you fuckin’ movin’
when you fuckin’ move out of here?

407
00:26:38,092 --> 00:26:40,474
Into the fucking whorehouse
down the way,

408
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:42,866
which you fucking sent me
to see that woman at,

409
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:45,440
if needin’ to piss in
my ear didn’t crowd out

410
00:26:45,684 --> 00:26:47,338
every other thought or recollection

411
00:26:47,621 --> 00:26:48,761
in your head!

412
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,600
How did the two of you get along?

413
00:26:55,473 --> 00:26:57,932
Did I just fucking say
I was movin’ in there?

414
00:26:58,194 --> 00:27:00,729
Which being it’s a fuckin’ whorehouse
could indicate

415
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:04,112
some fuckin’ business arrangement
or some other fuckin’ thing.

416
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:06,576
Yeah, I’m gonna be Queen Hooker.

417
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,964
You’re a keen fuckin’ student
of the human scene, Charlie!

418
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:14,822
Well, good!

419
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:17,988
Good.

420
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:24,219
Where are you going anyway?

421
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:30,171
I’ve made a decision not to tell you.

422
00:27:31,142 --> 00:27:35,143
If you made a decision not to tell me,
what did you just fuckin’ tell me for?

423
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:40,010
My decision is not to tell you
my specific destination…

424
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:43,321
’cause…

425
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:45,781
I don’t think I should.

426
00:27:46,768 --> 00:27:47,988
And that’s that.

427
00:27:48,848 --> 00:27:52,203
Well, have a safe journey
to your unannounced destination

428
00:27:52,447 --> 00:27:54,277
and a safe fucking return.

429
00:27:55,345 --> 00:27:58,982
And good luck to you with
your new livin’ arrangement.

430
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:01,361
And...

431
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,418
my best, please, to,
uh, Miss Stubbs.

432
00:28:06,607 --> 00:28:09,584
And you not only a fucking pain
in the balls, Charlie,

433
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:13,634
but also the strangest
fucking person I ever met.

434
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:16,439
You’ll get no argument here.

435
00:28:16,872 --> 00:28:17,964
Good!

436
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,071
3 plus 3 would equal 6.

437
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:33,964
Well, I sometimes put 9 to amuse myself.

438
00:28:34,828 --> 00:28:36,080
Alright, take it up.

439
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:39,342
Vigilant to detail like his Pa.

440
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:46,080
I’d think Mrs. Garret as
the bank’s chief backer

441
00:28:46,352 --> 00:28:47,984
might wish to be present
for its opening.

442
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,126
Well, as far as that, I got her proxy.

443
00:28:53,794 --> 00:28:55,480
Yes, but wouldn’t she wish to be?

444
00:28:59,711 --> 00:29:01,083
Perhaps she would.

445
00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:04,486
I can ask.

446
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:09,385
Excuse me.

447
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:17,535
What the fuck’s going on?

448
00:29:18,102 --> 00:29:19,883
You ask the wrong fella.

449
00:29:20,097 --> 00:29:22,674
The water comes to a boil
between them two fuckin’ women,

450
00:29:22,824 --> 00:29:25,022
I will fuckin’ guarantee you that much.

451
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:28,659
Have you proposed to Mrs. Garret
as you fuckin’ swore you would?

452
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,371
Leavin’ aside what
I did swear or didn’t,

453
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,190
let’s say I fuckin’ have.

454
00:29:34,434 --> 00:29:35,215
And?

455
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:38,567
That’s where the matter stands.
She ain’t said yes or no.

456
00:29:39,082 --> 00:29:42,033
How did the lady incline,
fuckin’ Ellsworth?

457
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,046
I wouldn’t guess, fuckin’ Trixie.

458
00:29:45,313 --> 00:29:47,357
Did you present yourself
enthusiastic?

459
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:49,864
Well, I didn’t dance a jig
if that’s what you’re asking.

460
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,315
Or more fuckin’ glum-like,

461
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,499
next to invitin’ refusal.

462
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:55,613
Not glum, not…

463
00:29:56,924 --> 00:29:58,876
invitin’ refusal.

464
00:29:59,638 --> 00:30:01,471
Straightforward, I’d call it.

465
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,734
- Sincere?
- Yeah.

466
00:30:08,212 --> 00:30:10,725
Well, what the fuck
is her fuckin’ problem then?

467
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:14,326
You’re a worthy enough fuckin’ candidate,

468
00:30:14,594 --> 00:30:16,680
given all her fuckin’ givens.

469
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:18,712
Warm endorsement.

470
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:22,657
She’d have to state her reservations.

471
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,223
Mrs. Garret writ me a letter

472
00:30:26,194 --> 00:30:29,631
saying how yesterday she lost her
temper with you somewhat,

473
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:31,971
and judgment,

474
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,387
she tipped she was on
to you bein’ a Pinkerton.

475
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:37,914
Oh, bein’ bright,

476
00:30:38,138 --> 00:30:40,488
I expect you concluded
it was me must have told her,

477
00:30:40,913 --> 00:30:43,076
meanin’ maybe
I had sold over to her,

478
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:45,852
and with my allegiance now in question,

479
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:47,880
I expect you wired
the Pinkerton big-shots,

480
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:50,852
arguing you oughtn’t sign any documents
that might be able to prove that you,

481
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:52,132
the agency

482
00:30:52,316 --> 00:30:55,054
and Mrs. Garret’s fuckin’ in-laws hired me

483
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:58,460
to lay at Mrs. Garret’s doorstep
the murder of her husband.

484
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:00,113
And further, Mr. Swearengen,

485
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,200
that as to purchase of your allegiance
-now in question-

486
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:05,204
they might wish to
keep the bidding open.

487
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,544
Biddin’s open always on everyone,
Miss Isringhausen.

488
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:14,476
But I expect you understand,
knowin’ as I do,

489
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:16,871
should Mrs. Garret lose her claim,

490
00:31:17,236 --> 00:31:19,279
rather than operate it themselves,

491
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:23,458
her cunt in-laws will sell
to third-party cocksuckers inimical

492
00:31:24,364 --> 00:31:25,618
to the whole of my interests

493
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:27,057
in this camp.

494
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:30,132
To buy my allegiance
against myself,

495
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:31,956
in-law cunts

496
00:31:32,552 --> 00:31:35,744
and shit-heel operators would
have to bid very high indeed.

497
00:31:37,394 --> 00:31:39,128
No, more likely
Miss Isringhausen,

498
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:43,008
I think you’d contemplate changing
your allegiance before I would mine.

499
00:31:45,593 --> 00:31:48,123
What benefit would I consider
might accrue to me?

500
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:52,689
I intercepted your shit-heel boss’s
message back to you,

501
00:31:52,963 --> 00:31:54,731
through the miracle of telegraph,

502
00:31:54,992 --> 00:31:56,809
and it answers that very question.

503
00:31:57,024 --> 00:32:00,103
As I have it here before me,
I will read it to you verbatim.

504
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:03,278
“Miss Isringhausen, as this
will save you great pain...

505
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:04,786
"... and keep you from being killed,...

506
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,493
"...sign all documents
Mr. Swearengen has drawn.

507
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:10,528
"Take the $5,000 and disappear.

508
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:12,632
"Yours sincerely,

509
00:32:13,023 --> 00:32:14,189
"your boss,...

510
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:16,029
...Pinkerton shit-heel.”

511
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:23,153
The $5,000 alluded to in
the invisible telegram,

512
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:25,438
can the money be produced?

513
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:33,755
Without, of course, exposing
him to the contents of the document,

514
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:36,980
I would want the sheriff
present at my signature,

515
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:39,147
and as my escort from the camp.

516
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,195
I bet that can be arranged.

517
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:49,369
I can’t betray the confidence of messages.

518
00:32:52,902 --> 00:32:55,635
Don’t guarantee what
you’ll never do, Blazanov

519
00:32:56,587 --> 00:32:59,256
not without imaginin’
your feet stuck to the fire.

520
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:02,504
Sir...

521
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:06,651
I am a person whose parents

522
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:08,808
have been murdered,

523
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:11,027
and no other family connection

524
00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:12,565
and feeling,

525
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:14,617
and believe

526
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:16,399
in confidence of messages.

527
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:18,926
What the fuck’s all that supposed to mean?

528
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:21,454
I hope…

529
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,678
feet in the fire

530
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,385
would not change me.

531
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:28,566
Congratulations, Mr. Nuttall.

532
00:33:28,813 --> 00:33:31,361
- Thank you, young man.
-  How’s the boneshaker?

533
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,395
Unshook.
Which would be a fib to say about me.

534
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:40,913
I’ve come, Sheriff,
to ask what you’ve learned

535
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:43,498
of the shootin’ yesterday in my place.

536
00:33:44,412 --> 00:33:47,454
Mose Manuel said his brother
killed himself by accident.

537
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:49,132
Uh, by accident?

538
00:33:49,681 --> 00:33:51,881
Two hours before Mose sells their claim

539
00:33:52,352 --> 00:33:54,052
that Charlie said they’d worked theirselves

540
00:33:54,382 --> 00:33:56,586
lock, stock and barrel to the Hearst interests?

541
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:58,839
There’s no witnesses, Tom.

542
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,032
Hurtful, brother against brother,

543
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:05,148
in a joint that bears my name...

544
00:34:06,106 --> 00:34:08,363
the most recent hurtful event.

545
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:13,510
But might I ask William to assist me

546
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:17,331
in calibrating the boneshaker’s
handlebars?

547
00:34:19,794 --> 00:34:20,655
Go ahead, William.

548
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:25,622
I don’t know how to
calibrate handlebars, sir.

549
00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:28,507
Oh, knowledge is
overrated, William.

550
00:34:28,786 --> 00:34:29,881
diligence is what’s required

551
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:32,370
in the service of a willing spirit.

552
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:35,347
Easy, easy, boy.

553
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:37,487
I use my right hand to pour.

554
00:34:42,388 --> 00:34:44,455
And then Miz Bullock

555
00:34:44,974 --> 00:34:46,511
said as it’s yours,

556
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:49,427
you might want to see
the safe installed.

557
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:51,145
Did she?

558
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,108
Yes, Ma’am.
Havin’ brought the midday meal

559
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:56,699
as the safe arrived
with the money inside.

560
00:35:00,074 --> 00:35:02,042
And what did Mr. Bullock
say to Mrs. Bullock?

561
00:35:03,124 --> 00:35:05,309
He said that might be
a good idea.

562
00:35:07,454 --> 00:35:11,024
With enthusiasm equaling yours
as you describe the moment?

563
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:14,518
I’d say on Mr. Bullock’s part,

564
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,505
about equal enthusiasm,

565
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,132
Mrs. Garret, yes.

566
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:21,365
Despite which Mrs. Bullock persisted?

567
00:35:26,956 --> 00:35:29,891
Well, perhaps I oughtn’t
to disappoint her.

568
00:35:35,381 --> 00:35:37,153
Earlier when I asked what else

569
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:40,238
we might have to discuss,
I referred to my proposal.

570
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:43,035
I took that to be your
meaning at the time.

571
00:35:43,444 --> 00:35:44,703
Chose not to respond.

572
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:48,030
Not to, yes, as I hadn’t
yet made up my mind.

573
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,323
- Have you now?
- Nor have I now.

574
00:35:57,629 --> 00:35:59,515
Would you have me decide now,

575
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:02,077
before I act on
Mrs. Bullock’s invitation?

576
00:36:03,376 --> 00:36:04,644
Do you put me to those terms

577
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:09,099
I guess there’s no burning rush.

578
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:15,647
Shall we go for a walk, Sofia?

579
00:36:42,718 --> 00:36:44,989
Are you sure you won’t join us?

580
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:50,862
Thank you. I tend to forego

581
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:52,330
the midday meal.

582
00:37:05,882 --> 00:37:07,429
It occurred to me,

583
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:11,127
Mrs. Garret having reason
to be present in any case,

584
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:13,807
that we might discuss
in more formed a fashion,

585
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,041
our plans for the children’s schooling,

586
00:37:18,045 --> 00:37:21,514
more constructively than in
some previous conversation.

587
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:29,303
I’m delighted.

588
00:37:30,093 --> 00:37:31,103
Wonderful.

589
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,528
Mr. Swearengen asked
to see you, Sheriff.

590
00:37:38,031 --> 00:37:39,040
Not just now.

591
00:37:48,992 --> 00:37:50,968
A man tying the right rope to the frame

592
00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:53,269
and the other end to a thunderhead,

593
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:55,914
could use the machine to tow clouds.

594
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,714
I wish I was taller.

595
00:37:57,904 --> 00:38:00,674
Well, when your legs lengthen,

596
00:38:00,907 --> 00:38:03,298
I calculate you’ll be among
the great cloud haulers of the world.

597
00:38:03,763 --> 00:38:07,224
Just to ride like you did yesterday, Mr. Nuttall.
You should have seen your face.

598
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:10,676
The Bella Union gap was my crucible, William.

599
00:38:10,931 --> 00:38:12,744
the fabled mud slick.

600
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:15,373
I shifted shoulders forward,

601
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:16,766
not too much,

602
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:19,156
and at a sledge-trench, Ho!

603
00:38:19,722 --> 00:38:21,540
Swung my buttocks left, by God,

604
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,796
turned the bars just so,

605
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,255
thump!

606
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:27,784
The buried plank,

607
00:38:28,147 --> 00:38:29,000
bom !

608
00:38:29,326 --> 00:38:31,274
And did I not come through a treat?

609
00:38:35,676 --> 00:38:36,710
Good afternoon.

610
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,648
Good afternoon, Mrs. Garret.

611
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:43,696
Good afternoon, Mrs. Bullock.

612
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:46,754
Very good wishes on a venture offering opportunity

613
00:38:47,384 --> 00:38:49,529
to so many in the camp.

614
00:38:57,498 --> 00:38:59,323
- Thank you.
- Hope.

615
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:04,336
For taking up the education
of the camp’s children,

616
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:06,615
my Sofia included, thank you.

617
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,242
As I feel I expressed inadequately
when last we spoke.

618
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,256
Bite of meat, Mrs. Garret?

619
00:39:19,142 --> 00:39:21,462
No, Thank you.
That appears to be the safe.

620
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:22,726
William,

621
00:39:22,974 --> 00:39:25,682
do we dare ride double?

622
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:28,483
-  I do if you do.
- I do!

623
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:30,385
Dauntless then!

624
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:34,138
Courage high to the sticking place,

625
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:37,166
and honor bright
as I mount and circle and consider

626
00:39:37,429 --> 00:39:39,419
the best way to swoop you up.

627
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:41,948
Awaiting you here, Sir.  (

628
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:47,760
Great.

629
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:50,250
Beautiful.

630
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,090
This all seems very much in order.

631
00:40:11,907 --> 00:40:13,252
First depositor.

632
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:32,780
it’s to witness some...

633
00:40:33,062 --> 00:40:36,242
wrist business, Sheriff. 
Al said brief but of crucial importance.

634
00:40:40,862 --> 00:40:43,572
- How long will we be?
- Brief, very.

635
00:40:44,036 --> 00:40:45,532
And you’d save me a beatin’.

636
00:40:50,814 --> 00:40:51,564
Excuse me.

637
00:40:56,147 --> 00:40:57,679
Get your head on it.

638
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,349
My head is on it.

639
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:02,494
Get your head on it, Tess!

640
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:04,431
It’s on it, Mr. Tolliver.

641
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:07,402
It does sound like a girl with
a mouthful, Mr. Manuel.

642
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:12,018
Her tongue in her cheek can
achieve the same fuckin’ effect.

643
00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:14,956
I require a conversation
with the Sheriff.

644
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:16,952
Confess a crime.

645
00:41:19,656 --> 00:41:21,001
You’re fuckin’ cheatin’ me!

646
00:41:23,144 --> 00:41:24,124
Get the fuck out from under there!

647
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,425
I ain’t cheatin’ you, Sir.

648
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:27,426
Will you have another dealer,
Mr. Manuel?

649
00:41:27,623 --> 00:41:28,801
Another fuckin’ cheat?

650
00:41:29,057 --> 00:41:32,132
Hot and cold’s the way the cards
run, Sir, time immemorial.

651
00:41:35,321 --> 00:41:36,769
I want it back. 

652
00:41:37,447 --> 00:41:38,873
Give it back to me!

653
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:43,171
Give him his last wager, Leon. 

654
00:41:43,393 --> 00:41:45,653
We’ll call that one no bet.

655
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:47,266
Yes, sir, Mr. Tolliver.

656
00:41:49,572 --> 00:41:51,373
All of it. Everything.

657
00:41:52,087 --> 00:41:55,221
Now, I can’t do that Mr. Manuel,
as I believe you know

658
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:58,531
- And those rifles are aimed at your head.
- Everything!

659
00:41:59,698 --> 00:42:01,411
Including youth, Mr. Manuel?

660
00:42:01,844 --> 00:42:04,683
And why not beauty? 
Not credibly restored, perhaps,

661
00:42:04,973 --> 00:42:07,382
but as a new
non-negotiable term? 

662
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:09,633
Would you not have, too,
your brother Charlie resurrected? 

663
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,386
Would you stipulate your envy
of him be purged surely,

664
00:42:12,754 --> 00:42:15,981
you’ll insist that Charlie
retain certain defects,

665
00:42:16,227 --> 00:42:19,231
his ineffable self-deceptions,
for example,

666
00:42:19,428 --> 00:42:21,439
and purpose, so far as you had one. 


667
00:42:21,814 --> 00:42:25,296
I suppose you would see removed
those qualities

668
00:42:25,564 --> 00:42:28,197
which caused you to love him,

669
00:42:28,566 --> 00:42:31,449
and the obliviousness to danger
which allowed you to shed his blood.

670
00:42:42,397 --> 00:42:43,905
I want to talk to Bullock!

671
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:47,031
Get the fucking Doc!

672
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,158
 I coulda cooled that out.

673
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,967
On my order, Mr. Tolliver,
Lee will burn this building,

674
00:42:54,152 --> 00:42:56,690
mutilating you before,
during or after as I specify,

675
00:42:56,859 --> 00:42:59,102
or when he chooses
unless I forbid.

676
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:01,928
My full attention is at your disposal.

677
00:43:02,193 --> 00:43:06,136
Tell Sheriff Bullock what transpired
here before getting the Doc.

678
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:17,318
And now how many?

679
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:18,529
Eight. 

680
00:43:21,718 --> 00:43:23,098
Two portions of four.

681
00:43:23,909 --> 00:43:25,410
Very good, Sofia.

682
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:27,717
May I have candy?

683
00:43:28,994 --> 00:43:32,419
You ask a reward, Sofia,
for doing your numbers??

684
00:43:32,926 --> 00:43:35,160
Where would you get such an idea?

685
00:43:39,372 --> 00:43:40,764
“Received...

686
00:43:41,107 --> 00:43:42,333
...from Trixie…"

687
00:43:43,844 --> 00:43:44,949
The whore.

688
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:49,817
May I sign the first receipt?

689
00:43:50,946 --> 00:43:52,212
Yes, please do.

690
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,539
Huzzah.

691
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:06,459
I’m to fetch Sheriff Bullock.

692
00:44:06,836 --> 00:44:08,211
He’ll be back momentarily.

693
00:44:11,017 --> 00:44:12,017
All right, let’s go.

694
00:44:12,237 --> 00:44:14,066
- Ready, ready, ready!
- Ready, here we go!

695
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:18,544
We missed.

696
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:20,970
Trial run.  No harm done at all.

697
00:44:21,221 --> 00:44:22,379
Hey, swing around, Tom!

698
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:24,061
On my way! 

699
00:44:24,365 --> 00:44:25,610
Tie off that leg rope.

700
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,276
Don’t you want to serve your country

701
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:30,556
as good as they been to you? 
I bet you don’t even vote.

702
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,027
Hold that leg rope!

703
00:45:03,552 --> 00:45:06,289
That’s between us. 
Tell no one I give you that.

704
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:08,670
I best now, but thank you.

705
00:45:08,891 --> 00:45:11,258
You keep it a secret,
and you won’t get into any trouble.

706
00:45:12,131 --> 00:45:15,935
And if you told I helped you on the bike,
that’s between you and your father.

707
00:45:22,364 --> 00:45:23,176
Oh shit!

708
00:46:11,053 --> 00:46:12,826
I think my back’s broke.

709
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,250
