1
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,442
Previously on Hatfields & McCoys...

2
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:11,953
All this to-do over a pig.

3
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:16,258
This is about honor,
about lyin', and murder.

4
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:17,325
I'm Johnse Hatfield.

5
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:18,426
I know who you are.

6
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:20,495
You spent the night under a Hatfield roof?

7
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:21,796
You're not my daughter anymore.

8
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:24,165
They're trying to kill you.

9
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,867
I'm going there to rescue my bride.

10
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:26,768
Uh!

11
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:29,070
I'm gonna shoot you dead, come dark!

12
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:31,039
My brothers have got Johnse.

13
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,408
Please, Mr. Hatfield, hurry!

14
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:03,338
Hurry up.

15
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:09,811
Stop.

16
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:16,551
See, I want to just shoot you myself.

17
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,488
But I got to humor my brothers.

18
00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:24,926
In a couple of minutes,
when the sun comes up,

19
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:28,930
I'm gonna give you this pistol.

20
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:33,601
Now, will you do the honorable
thing and kill yourself?

21
00:01:33,703 --> 00:01:35,503
Why in God's name would I do that?

22
00:01:35,604 --> 00:01:37,238
Shame and remorse.

23
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,174
Bullshit.

24
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:44,346
No, you all,

25
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:48,083
you just want to save yourselves
from doing a murder.

26
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:52,120
And I ain't ashamed of loving Roseanna.

27
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:09,170
So he won't die by his own hand.

28
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:11,973
Will he eat poison?

29
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:12,974
To hell with this.

30
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:15,610
Guns down.

31
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:18,480
Now.

32
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:22,384
I said now.

33
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:27,355
Do what he says,
or I'll scatter your brains

34
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,124
all over this place.

35
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,449
The rest of you kneel down
there next to your brother

36
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,451
and pray as if your lives depend on it,

37
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,854
on account they do.

38
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:01,923
Are you deaf, McCoy?

39
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:03,491
I said to kneel.

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,194
I kneel for no man.

41
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:11,533
And I pray only to God,

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
not you.

43
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:17,672
You're a brave man, Jim McCoy.

44
00:03:21,677 --> 00:03:24,946
Your daddy should be proud.

45
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,518
All right, Skunkhair, torch it.

46
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,730
You know, we should've burnt
down this shithole years ago.

47
00:03:50,873 --> 00:03:54,075
Whoo!

48
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:55,410
This is none of your business.

49
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:57,011
Get off me!

50
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,047
You're a damn fool for riding into McCoy hands.

51
00:03:59,148 --> 00:04:02,817
None of that matters now.

52
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:05,787
Roseanna's carrying my baby.

53
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:07,922
She saved my life.

54
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,624
I'm gonna marry her.

55
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:15,063
Roseanna's what?

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,401
Did you know about this?

57
00:04:20,503 --> 00:04:21,836
Johnse, she's a McCoy.

58
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:22,871
She betrayed her own family.

59
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:24,405
She'll betray ours too.

60
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:25,840
That ain't true.

61
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:27,442
You know, I ain't...
I ain't taking this.

62
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,179
No, you'll take it.

63
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,413
Stop it!

64
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:33,948
You'll take it and like it.

65
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:36,184
Stop it, please!

66
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:37,285
Anse, Anse!

67
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:38,553
Hey, that's enough.

68
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:40,355
That is enough.
That is... that is enough!

69
00:04:40,456 --> 00:04:44,259
You don't touch that boy
no more, Anderson Hatfield.

70
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:48,062
You will never marry a McCoy.

71
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:53,568
You leave this house to go after her.

72
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:57,105
You don't come back.

73
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:58,606
Now, you make your choice.
Make it now.

74
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:01,643
Stay or go.

75
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:15,483
Whoo!
- Whoo-whoo-whoo!

76
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:18,553
I'm up.

77
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:20,755
Come on, come on.

78
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:23,858
Go, squirrel.

79
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:30,331
Come on, Sammy.

80
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:34,869
Ah-ha!
- Whoo!

81
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,672
Now we got a competition on our hands, boys!

82
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,608
One apiece.
Robert E.

83
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:41,943
Here.

84
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:44,646
Jefferson, Jefferson.

85
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:45,847
That's the family discount.

86
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,515
Give me that.
- No.

87
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,883
How much you had already?
- No, I ain't had nothing.

88
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,318
Give it to me.
- I ain't had nothing.

89
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:51,552
Stop acting like that.

90
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:52,954
Quit hitting me.
Quit hitting me.

91
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:55,056
Hey, Robert E., take over.

92
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:01,863
Nancy.

93
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:03,898
Hello, Johnse Hatfield.

94
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,166
Hey.

95
00:07:05,234 --> 00:07:07,835
How ya been?

96
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:11,506
I been fine.

97
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,242
You know,
I should've called on you.

98
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:16,210
I really didn't mean you no harm.

99
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:20,882
I just... I guess what happened
was kind of an accident.

100
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,584
I guess it was.

101
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:26,287
But don't you worry about it none.

102
00:07:26,355 --> 00:07:30,258
I just been all messed up
in my mind about Roseanna.

103
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:31,359
How is she?

104
00:07:31,427 --> 00:07:33,861
Poorly.

105
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:36,464
Doctor says she took down with a cough.

106
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:39,367
She's been spitting up blood.

107
00:07:40,903 --> 00:07:42,103
They think she might lose the baby.

108
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,072
Lose it?

109
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,573
Or not.

110
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:48,643
Who knows?

111
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,411
Hey, will you...

112
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,748
would you tell her that I asked
after her and the baby?

113
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:56,217
Would you do that for me?

114
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:57,418
I'll pass it along...

115
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,255
Next time I see Roseanna.

116
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:21,509
Hey, grandpappy.

117
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,177
That ain't funny.

118
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:25,546
Yeah, it is.

119
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:33,087
Hey, don't let it eat you up.

120
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:35,089
Hey, speaking of eatin',

121
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,525
have you tried this pickled okra?

122
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:41,429
Delicious.

123
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,397
It's a damn pepper.

124
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:43,865
Bullnose red hot.

125
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:45,500
You son of a bitch.

126
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,269
If you weren't my brother,
you'd be dead right now.

127
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,807
Come on, now.
Let's dance.

128
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,876
Right there, son.

129
00:08:54,943 --> 00:08:59,013
This competition's still open, ain't it?

130
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:01,649
If'n you don't mind wasting a bullet.

131
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,352
I ain't wasted one yet.

132
00:09:08,023 --> 00:09:10,858
How you gonna beat that,
fog eye?

133
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:15,096
Good luck.

134
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:18,699
Hey, hey, toe the line.

135
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,470
You're over the damn mark.

136
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:24,439
Yeah,
Judge should've caught that.

137
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,942
Just do what you do, son.

138
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:31,045
What he does is miss.

139
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,356
Oh, Cap.

140
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:43,982
You missed complete.

141
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,656
No, he didn't.

142
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,258
Hit the nail on the head.

143
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,361
Right on the gol'dang head.

144
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,830
You see where that went.

145
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,098
Hey, settle down, boys.

146
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,265
No, no, no, no, no, no.

147
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,000
This here is a shooting contest.

148
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,002
This here is a shooting contest,
boys.

149
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,471
Get up.

150
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,046
Look at this.

151
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,949
Watch McCoy put his head down.

152
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,854
Hatfield's a-tremblin'.

153
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,862
Devil Anse couldn't meet the old man's eye.

154
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,298
Randall McCoy looked away

155
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,802
like a lonely girl seeing
a hard prick for the first time!

156
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,938
You watch your filthy mouth,
Hatfield.

157
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,608
Might be some rowdy-do.

158
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,643
Whatever happens, Cotton,
you stay right here.

159
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:45,811
Keep these horses peaceable.

160
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,781
Hah!

161
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,086
Yeah, McCoy flinched.

162
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,654
Skipped off a step.

163
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,989
Hatfield, he shit himself.

164
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,458
You can smell it yet.

165
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,826
How'd you see it, Ellison?

166
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,895
Seems to me both men behaved gentlemanly.

167
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:07,699
If anyone looked off,
they both did together.

168
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,805
Let's go.

169
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,978
That is for owing me almost

170
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,080
a whole greenback on my heirloom fiddle

171
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,750
for a year, you thieving prick.

172
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,518
Johnse was right.

173
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,255
You hit like a old woman.

174
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,125
Maybe we should get you a bonnet and a dress.

175
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,295
No more.

176
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,263
I am hell on earth!

177
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,299
You're a damn stinkhog.

178
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,937
That's enough now.

179
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,572
You take him, Ellison.

180
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,713
Hatfields, stay out of this.

181
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,048
Get in there.

182
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,783
Come on, bud.

183
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,284
Come on, get him.

184
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,587
Yeah, that's the way.

185
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,522
How many more do you need?

186
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:04,823
Let him sit there.

187
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,592
Aw, we ain't done with you yet.

188
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,368
Aww.

189
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,174
Ah!

190
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,983
Go on, there, get him!

191
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,352
Go take your dancing lessons.

192
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,622
You're going dancin'!

193
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:37,623
Take this.

194
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,891
Stick 'em.

195
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,017
Ellison!

196
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,997
Hold on, little brother.

197
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,136
Just keep holding on.

198
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,703
Anse, Anse.

199
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,504
Where's...

200
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,406
Where's Cotton?

201
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,843
Cotton, come here.

202
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,148
Let the law handle it.

203
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,017
You get well.

204
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,120
We'll look after the rest.

205
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,222
Cotton, you comfort your daddy.

206
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,891
Can we go home now?

207
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,428
Levicy, get him to a bed at the house.

208
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,100
Johnse, Captain, get his legs.

209
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,501
Gonna get him in the wagon.

210
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,670
Levicy, get a blanket.

211
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,305
Gonna get him up there...

212
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,540
He was always angling for peace,

213
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,609
throwing water on fires that others started,

214
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,247
letting people have their way,
and now...

215
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,816
now maybe killed for it.

216
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,051
What did Ellison say to you?

217
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,955
Asked for Cotton.

218
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,156
We got 'em!

219
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,991
Sherriff holed 'em up!

220
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,993
We got them bastard McCoys.

221
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,428
We got 'em, Anse.

222
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,817
Sheriff,
you can't let them take us.

223
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,285
How's your brother, Anse?

224
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:23,755
Still alive...

225
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:26,191
Barely.

226
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,027
I need you to hand over your prisoners, sheriff.

227
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,397
I understand how you feel,
Anse.

228
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,299
But these boys broke Kentucky law

229
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,568
on Kentucky soil and are obliged

230
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,737
to be tried by Kentucky justice.

231
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,307
Yeah.

232
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,909
Well, I'll take 'em anyways.

233
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,277
Anse, give me a minute.

234
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,514
I want to go on a record about all this.

235
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,151
I wish you would, Judge.

236
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,388
Explain to your brother howsomever he and you

237
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,492
and the other Hatfields feel...
and I know that's awful...

238
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,328
this business requires to be done legal.

239
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,264
Sheriff,
you acknowledge the victim

240
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,933
was a West Virginia citizen.

241
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,502
That's the essence of the case determinative.

242
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,638
That's why West Virginia law prevails.

243
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,441
Now, you can dispute the matter
here or later in court.

244
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,809
It's your choice,
you son of a bitch.

245
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,314
You're likely to lose in either venue.

246
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,715
Yah.

247
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:31,256
You abscond with these boys
over my strenuous objection.

248
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:35,627
Easy, easy.

249
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,203
Damn.

250
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:06,992
He gon...
he gonna die?

251
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:10,662
Should've already.

252
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,451
Oh, my lord.

253
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,421
Obtained a directive from Judge Tobias Wagner

254
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,757
instructing the sheriff to
recapture and restore the boys

255
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:39,958
to his lawful custody.

256
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,293
Sheriff.

257
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,761
The law...

258
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:45,197
Ain't worth a bucket of spit.

259
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,499
They-they were kidnapped illegal.

260
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,267
So why can't we kidnap 'em back the same way?

261
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,769
No, Hatfields will have 'em heavily guarded.

262
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,237
Could turn into a bloodbath.

263
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,673
Sweet Jesus,
what have they done?

264
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,341
Jim, you go with Perry to Pikeville

265
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,578
and get this letter toÃ© sheriff maynard.

266
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,948
Calvin, you stay here with
your mother until I get back.

267
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:16,995
Poppy,
you ain't going over there.

268
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:20,131
Alone he'll do me no harm.

269
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,476
It's Poppy.

270
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:05,877
Where?
Where?

271
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,445
Right there.

272
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,680
Where?

273
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,248
Right... you see him?
- Yeah, I see him.

274
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,983
He's coming to get us.
- There he is, Poppy.

275
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:36,408
I come unarmed to ask you for my boys.

276
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,009
You got my word.

277
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,911
I'll turn 'em over to the law in Pikeville.

278
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:44,282
Your boys stabbed my brother.

279
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,919
They stabbed him over
and over again, then shot him.

280
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,856
Penalty for that's the same in Kentucky

281
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,492
as it is in West Virginia.

282
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,827
How is Ellison?

283
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,202
I pray he recovers.

284
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,105
You still believe in praying?

285
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,474
I do.

286
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,244
Well, then we'll leave it to the almighty.

287
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:16,381
If my brother survives,
you can have your boys,

288
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,951
and we'll let Kentucky law take its course.

289
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,320
If he dies...

290
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,788
If my brother dies,

291
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,957
your boys will stay here not long before justice

292
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,993
will be done on 'em.

293
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,995
Is there anything I can say or give you

294
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:32,564
that'll move you from that?

295
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,466
No.

296
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,038
I'd like to see my sons.

297
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,313
I don't think so.

298
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,749
Then let their mother see 'em.

299
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,193
We'll send for her.

300
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,706
Devil Anse Hatfield,

301
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:19,110
I rue the day I saved your life.

302
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,979
May God damn your eternal soul.

303
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,349
That might be, Randall.

304
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,919
But I don't recall God saving your ass that day.

305
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,355
We saved each other,
'cause that's...

306
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:33,224
'cause that's what men do in war.

307
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,294
This all here,
this all sits the way it sits,

308
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,731
'cause of us and nobody else.

309
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,100
If you feel the need
to bring up God one more time,

310
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,869
whose side he sits on...

311
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,508
You won't be making a ride home.

312
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,681
Yah.

313
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,754
Hey.

314
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:06,224
I hope you and all of your kin

315
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,226
and friends and babies

316
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,628
come and try to rescue 'em
so's we kill you all at once,

317
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,497
not drag it out.

318
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:15,233
Jim.

319
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,602
Shut up.

320
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,074
What, where's he going?
What's he doing?

321
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,242
He's leaving us.

322
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,877
What?

323
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,111
He's leaving.

324
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,179
Poppy!
- Poppy!

325
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,715
Poppy!
- Shut up.

326
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,116
Poppy!

327
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:33,685
Poppy, we're here!

328
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:35,053
Shut up.

329
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,329
Poppy!

330
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:59,177
What are you doing?

331
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,879
Cutting the boards.

332
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,080
What for?

333
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:03,948
There's a possibility.

334
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,884
There's a possibility of uncle Ellison dyin'.

335
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,786
Jim said we'd want a coffin.

336
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,689
Don't you cut no boards.

337
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:21,065
I tell you when you can cut any boards.

338
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:25,003
Yes, sir.

339
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,754
Now you better do your job and get 'em back.

340
00:24:06,855 --> 00:24:08,356
We just have to get up a posse.

341
00:24:08,457 --> 00:24:11,059
We have a written finding
here from Judge Tobias Wagner

342
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:13,728
stating you're legally entitled
to enter West Virginia

343
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,630
in hot pursuit.

344
00:24:15,731 --> 00:24:18,232
West Virginia's sovereign

345
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,668
and has armed Hatfields swarming all over.

346
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:22,670
You cannot abide by this.

347
00:24:22,771 --> 00:24:24,405
If'n Ellison Hatfield dies,

348
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:26,641
Devil Anse has so much has said
he'd kill my sons.

349
00:24:26,742 --> 00:24:29,477
Ellison dies,
your sons are murderers.

350
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:38,220
Just made some enemies,
sheriff.

351
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:41,590
Get out of my way.

352
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:48,430
Reverend Garrett.

353
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:54,603
Captain Anderson Hatfield sent me to fetch you.

354
00:24:54,704 --> 00:24:56,171
He promised Randall.

355
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:58,874
Ellison?

356
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:02,210
Passed over Jordan singing with the angels.

357
00:25:02,312 --> 00:25:03,245
Oh, dear God.

358
00:25:03,346 --> 00:25:07,649
Ma.

359
00:25:07,717 --> 00:25:09,851
I'm to fetch you to your boys.

360
00:25:09,952 --> 00:25:11,220
Where are they?

361
00:25:11,283 --> 00:25:13,184
They're in a safe place where they can visit

362
00:25:13,285 --> 00:25:14,985
with their mother.

363
00:25:15,087 --> 00:25:17,421
I'm to bring only her.

364
00:25:17,489 --> 00:25:21,392
I gave my word.

365
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,568
Ride to Pikeville.

366
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:35,172
Tell your father where I am
and what has happened.

367
00:25:35,273 --> 00:25:38,109
All right, ma.

368
00:26:16,615 --> 00:26:19,150
I've come to see my sons.

369
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,121
They're inside.

370
00:26:32,297 --> 00:26:33,831
It's very Christian of you to do this, Anse.

371
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:35,599
Save it for your congregation,
preacher.

372
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,670
Please, Captain Hatfield.

373
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:42,239
Let me take 'em back to Kentucky with me.

374
00:26:46,077 --> 00:26:48,612
Please.

375
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:55,486
You'll get 'em back.

376
00:26:55,587 --> 00:26:57,988
That much I can promise you.

377
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:11,035
Mama.

378
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:12,870
I brought some food from home.

379
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:14,738
Is Poppy here?

380
00:27:14,806 --> 00:27:16,507
Is he coming?

381
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,610
I've got apples from the yard tree and cheese,

382
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:21,979
the one you like, bud,

383
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,081
bread your sister baked...

384
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:25,216
Is pop comin' back?

385
00:27:25,283 --> 00:27:27,851
Some chicken.

386
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,820
From the first book of kings...
- Hold on, reverend.

387
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:32,323
Mama, we...

388
00:27:32,424 --> 00:27:34,191
We saw Poppy riding away.
When's he coming back?

389
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:36,093
When's he getting us out of here?

390
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:44,034
You can't imagine the pain that comes

391
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:47,738
with giving birth to a child.

392
00:27:47,806 --> 00:27:50,307
But I welcomed that pain over and over

393
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:54,545
so that I might have each of you.

394
00:27:54,646 --> 00:27:58,882
I love you all

395
00:27:58,984 --> 00:28:01,819
and will always love you.

396
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,089
But what about Poppy?

397
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,225
He will always love you too.

398
00:28:08,293 --> 00:28:10,661
I meant...

399
00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:15,566
'Any who escape the sword of hazael

400
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:19,903
'will be put to death by Jehu.

401
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:23,040
'And any who escape the sword of Jehu

402
00:28:23,108 --> 00:28:27,344
'will be put to death by Elisha.

403
00:28:27,445 --> 00:28:32,016
'But I shall spare 7,000 in Israel.

404
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:37,087
'All the knees that have not bent before baal.

405
00:28:37,188 --> 00:28:40,124
All the mouths that have not kissed him.'

406
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,015
All right.

407
00:30:13,518 --> 00:30:17,354
Whoa, whoa.

408
00:30:19,224 --> 00:30:21,258
Hickory tree there.

409
00:30:34,773 --> 00:30:37,908
Tie 'em tight now.

410
00:30:37,976 --> 00:30:41,678
Johnse.

411
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,180
Johnse.

412
00:30:43,248 --> 00:30:45,883
Is that too tight?

413
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:52,222
You're shooting phamer there

414
00:30:52,323 --> 00:30:55,325
when the time comes.

415
00:30:55,427 --> 00:30:57,361
You reap what you sow.

416
00:31:00,965 --> 00:31:02,199
You're shooting Tolbert.

417
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,634
Mm.

418
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,504
Tolbert first.

419
00:31:07,605 --> 00:31:10,174
Bud.

420
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:37,100
You boys understand what's gonna happen here?

421
00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:47,845
You understand why?

422
00:31:47,912 --> 00:31:50,280
Make yourselves ready.

423
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,630
Aim!

424
00:32:16,508 --> 00:32:20,044
Harden your hearts.

425
00:33:13,732 --> 00:33:16,700
Oh.

426
00:33:20,717 --> 00:33:24,453
'Surely thou shalt slay the wicked, o God.

427
00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:29,458
'Depart from me therefore,
ye bloody men.

428
00:33:29,526 --> 00:33:32,862
'Do not I hate them that hate thee, o lord?

429
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:36,065
'I hate them with perfect hatred.

430
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:38,334
I count them mine enemies.'

431
00:33:38,401 --> 00:33:41,904
Same family that killed
your brothers killed my pap.

432
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:45,774
Somebody ought to do something about it.

433
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:48,228
I don't see your sister.

434
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,264
Roseanna's ailing.

435
00:33:50,365 --> 00:33:51,966
Still laid over at aunt Betty's.

436
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:53,567
Can't travel none.

437
00:33:53,635 --> 00:33:55,069
She lose the baby?

438
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:58,272
No, it come, a girl,

439
00:33:58,373 --> 00:34:00,641
but it's sickly.

440
00:34:00,742 --> 00:34:02,209
Likely to perish?

441
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:03,677
I pray not.

442
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:05,145
But likely.

443
00:34:05,213 --> 00:34:07,548
Likely.

444
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:11,018
Baby's daddy,
Johnse Hatfield...

445
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,588
Folks are saying he was amongst
them that killed your brothers.

446
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:17,057
I pray he wasn't.

447
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,960
Likely was.

448
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:21,628
Likely.

449
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,664
Tolbert...

450
00:34:23,732 --> 00:34:26,166
Phamer...

451
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,437
And bud...

452
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:33,007
Having been handled with such

453
00:34:33,108 --> 00:34:37,878
manifest injustice and cruelly murdered,

454
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:40,481
when they stand before the lord,

455
00:34:40,582 --> 00:34:42,549
he will wash away their sins

456
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,485
and take them to the promised land.

457
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:49,156
People forget.

458
00:34:49,224 --> 00:34:53,360
Hatfields killed our pap too.

459
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:56,263
Honest soldier coming home from war

460
00:34:56,364 --> 00:34:58,332
doing no harm.

461
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,701
That's another item goes on Hatfield's account...

462
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:02,669
Shut up.
Come on.

463
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:04,071
Which reckoning is past due,

464
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,773
which bill needs collectin'.

465
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,276
Come on.

466
00:35:50,585 --> 00:35:52,086
I'm accepting donations,

467
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:54,088
reward money for the capture or killing

468
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:55,456
of the murderous Hatfields.

469
00:35:55,523 --> 00:35:57,424
McCoy family thanks you.

470
00:35:57,525 --> 00:36:00,627
Do not let this atrocity go unpunished.

471
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:03,197
Jesus will be smiling on you and your family.

472
00:36:03,298 --> 00:36:06,600
Thank you.
Thank you.

473
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:32,126
It ain't fitting you remain here

474
00:36:32,227 --> 00:36:35,696
just sitting days on end.

475
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:40,267
I know he's revenged.

476
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:42,803
I miss my daddy.

477
00:36:42,904 --> 00:36:45,205
My brother was always about the work of life.

478
00:36:45,273 --> 00:36:47,975
He'd...

479
00:36:48,076 --> 00:36:50,377
He'd not...

480
00:36:50,445 --> 00:36:54,047
He'd not want you lingering about his remains...

481
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:03,190
Not when...
not when there's chores to do.

482
00:37:35,523 --> 00:37:37,824
A lot of strange faces in town.

483
00:37:37,926 --> 00:37:39,893
Man hunters, Randall,

484
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:42,729
here to bring your sons' killers to justice.

485
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,464
They ain't here for justice.

486
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:47,000
They're here to try and collect
the bounty we're offering.

487
00:37:50,438 --> 00:37:52,439
Ma'am.

488
00:38:23,304 --> 00:38:26,006
This here Devil Anse
Hatfield's loggin' enterprise?

489
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:28,575
Devil Anse won't be back till tomorrow mornin'.

490
00:38:28,676 --> 00:38:32,179
If you're looking for work,
he only hires men he know:

491
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,880
His neighbors, his kin.

492
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:36,984
Well, right now, I believe
I got business with you.

493
00:38:37,051 --> 00:38:39,353
What's that?

494
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,723
You got that funny streak
of white in your hair, Tom.

495
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:44,491
Guess that's why folks call you Skunkhair.

496
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:46,927
My friends call me that.

497
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:49,863
Well, no reason we can't be friends, Tom.

498
00:38:49,964 --> 00:38:53,667
Don't get testy.

499
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:56,536
I'm just doing my job.

500
00:38:56,604 --> 00:39:00,173
You got a prize on your head,
Mr. Skunkhair Tom Wallace.

501
00:39:00,241 --> 00:39:01,975
You got the wrong man.
I didn't do nothin'.

502
00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:04,444
Kentucky courts say otherwise.

503
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:06,313
You must've crossed the tug and got lost.

504
00:39:06,414 --> 00:39:07,347
This here West Virginia.

505
00:39:07,415 --> 00:39:09,216
I'm in the right place, Tom.

506
00:39:09,317 --> 00:39:12,152
McCoy family's gettin' indictments for them

507
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,021
that murdered their three boys,

508
00:39:14,122 --> 00:39:16,056
already posted rewards.

509
00:39:16,157 --> 00:39:17,658
What the hell?

510
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:18,825
How much?

511
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:21,395
I don't recollect exact.

512
00:39:21,496 --> 00:39:23,363
Couldn't be more than two bits or so for you.

513
00:39:23,431 --> 00:39:24,798
You son of a bitch.

514
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,893
Shut it down.

515
00:39:44,995 --> 00:39:46,161
Take 'em off.

516
00:39:46,262 --> 00:39:48,931
All right.

517
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:54,970
Hey, Selkirk, come here.

518
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:57,172
Come here.
Where you been?

519
00:39:57,273 --> 00:39:58,340
You been drinkin', hmm?

520
00:39:58,441 --> 00:39:59,975
No, sir.

521
00:40:00,076 --> 00:40:01,110
No?

522
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:02,344
You sleepin'?

523
00:40:02,445 --> 00:40:06,115
Yes, sir.

524
00:40:06,182 --> 00:40:07,816
I'm a hold back 25Â¢?

525
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:09,852
Yes, sir.

526
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:16,258
25Â¢?

527
00:40:22,832 --> 00:40:25,801
Ugh.

528
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:27,403
Anse!

529
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:31,273
Anse!

530
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:32,508
Ugh.

531
00:40:39,382 --> 00:40:42,518
They scalped him,
like Indians done it.

532
00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:49,658
He's my best friend since we was little.

533
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:52,661
Jim.

534
00:40:52,762 --> 00:40:55,864
He was my best friend.

535
00:40:58,601 --> 00:41:03,038
Randall McCoy done this.

536
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:04,940
Thought we'd leveled the scales.

537
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:08,043
Uncle Anse,
I found these in the logs

538
00:41:08,144 --> 00:41:10,879
underneath Skunkhair.

539
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:13,348
$750 for you.

540
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:16,351
Seeing as how you was the outlaw leader.

541
00:41:16,419 --> 00:41:18,487
What in tarnation?

542
00:41:18,588 --> 00:41:20,055
Am I in there, French?

543
00:41:20,156 --> 00:41:22,624
Well, I'll be damned, Lark,
you and me both.

544
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:24,259
They're after me too.

545
00:41:24,327 --> 00:41:26,295
Hell, Selkirk,
you're worth more than me,

546
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:29,832
McCoy defector that you are.

547
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:31,567
$600?

548
00:41:31,668 --> 00:41:33,669
That's uncle Wall.

549
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,706
Uncle Wall wasn't even in that shootin'.

550
00:41:37,774 --> 00:41:40,242
This is out of hand.

551
00:41:40,343 --> 00:41:42,578
Greedy bushwhackers
and bloodsuckers by the dozens

552
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:47,349
are gonna come after us.

553
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,384
Just keep your guns handy.

554
00:41:49,486 --> 00:41:50,953
Cap.

555
00:41:51,054 --> 00:41:53,021
Yes, sir.

556
00:41:53,123 --> 00:41:56,024
Take care of Skunkhair here.

557
00:41:56,126 --> 00:41:59,495
Everybody else get back to work.

558
00:41:59,596 --> 00:42:00,929
'Lias.

559
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:04,767
Come on.
- Anse, a word.

560
00:42:04,868 --> 00:42:08,103
Reckon we ought to stock up on supplies and ammo.

561
00:42:08,171 --> 00:42:11,507
We need to take to them hills if a posse comes.

562
00:42:14,711 --> 00:42:16,979
Nobody knows these hills like us.

563
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:23,018
Set up lookouts along the tug.

564
00:42:23,086 --> 00:42:25,420
We won't get caught unawares again.

565
00:42:25,522 --> 00:42:27,990
Uhhuh.

566
00:42:28,091 --> 00:42:32,127
What do you hear of Roseanna?

567
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:33,729
I once had a daughter Roseanna,

568
00:42:33,797 --> 00:42:35,097
who's now dead to me.

569
00:42:39,803 --> 00:42:40,903
How's Sally holding up?

570
00:42:41,004 --> 00:42:44,439
Poorly.
How would you expect?

571
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:47,810
Women are fortunate to enjoy
special consideration, hmm?

572
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:50,412
If I curled up in a ball
every tragic turn of events,

573
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:52,447
I'd never get any work done.

574
00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:53,916
Quit talkin' like an imbecile.

575
00:42:53,983 --> 00:42:56,285
You never lost your sons.

576
00:42:56,386 --> 00:42:58,921
Mr. Cline?

577
00:42:58,988 --> 00:43:00,155
Not now.
We're busy here.

578
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:07,396
Not too busy to pay me the $250 bounty owed me

579
00:43:07,463 --> 00:43:10,065
on Mr. Skunkhair Tom Wallace.

580
00:43:17,006 --> 00:43:18,841
Should I have brung his ears too?

581
00:43:18,908 --> 00:43:21,777
Put that abomination away.

582
00:43:21,845 --> 00:43:24,680
I'm owed the bounty.

583
00:43:24,747 --> 00:43:27,783
There were no conditions imposed.

584
00:43:27,851 --> 00:43:29,484
We are not Savages.

585
00:43:29,552 --> 00:43:32,421
It is our duty to bring
the Savages in for justice.

586
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:36,758
Avoiding unnecessary wear
and tear on their corpses.

587
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:38,427
Had to get me out of West Virginie quick.

588
00:43:38,528 --> 00:43:42,264
Couldn't strain my horse toting a whole carcass.

589
00:43:42,365 --> 00:43:44,166
What's your name?

590
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:45,667
Frank Phillips.

591
00:43:45,735 --> 00:43:48,871
You the one they call 'Bad Frank'?

592
00:43:48,938 --> 00:43:50,806
Not to my face.

593
00:43:50,907 --> 00:43:53,175
And not twice.

594
00:43:53,243 --> 00:43:56,745
Do not come back for more
reward money, Mr. Phillips.

595
00:43:56,846 --> 00:43:58,947
I will not be a party to atrocity.

596
00:43:59,015 --> 00:44:01,149
Any event,
we got our indictments

597
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:03,252
against the murderers,
and we're sending deputies

598
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:05,988
across the tug.

599
00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:08,957
No doubt they'll handle things just fine.

600
00:45:07,884 --> 00:45:09,918
Ma'am.

601
00:45:09,986 --> 00:45:11,019
I'd like to see Roseanna.

602
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,522
See our baby.

603
00:45:13,623 --> 00:45:16,058
Even if she weren't too sickly,

604
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,527
she'd not want to see
the murderer of her brothers.

605
00:45:21,431 --> 00:45:22,965
I didn't...
I didn't murder 'em.

606
00:45:23,066 --> 00:45:24,800
I raised my rifle.

607
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:26,802
I shot over their heads.

608
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:27,970
You can ask Alex Messer.

609
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:34,576
I built a cabin for me,
Roseanna,

610
00:45:34,677 --> 00:45:36,211
and the baby to live at.

611
00:45:36,312 --> 00:45:40,549
It's a... it's a real nice one
with an oilpaper window.

612
00:45:40,616 --> 00:45:42,751
You built a cabin for your whiskey business

613
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:44,386
and to consort with whores.

614
00:45:44,454 --> 00:45:45,954
God damn it.

615
00:45:46,055 --> 00:45:49,558
I took a chance coming here.

616
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:53,228
They got a reward out for me.

617
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:57,733
Please.

618
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,802
A man...

619
00:46:00,903 --> 00:46:02,771
A man's got a right to see his own child.

620
00:46:02,872 --> 00:46:06,341
You got no rights here.

621
00:46:06,442 --> 00:46:10,012
Now, get yourself off my porch and gone.

622
00:46:21,357 --> 00:46:22,457
I got my rights!

623
00:46:22,558 --> 00:46:23,592
I'm tellin' you that!

624
00:46:23,693 --> 00:46:26,261
God damn it!

625
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:48,250
Come on, girl.

626
00:47:01,097 --> 00:47:04,733
Fft, fft, fft.

627
00:47:16,946 --> 00:47:18,180
You see him?

628
00:47:18,281 --> 00:47:21,049
You see him?

629
00:47:21,117 --> 00:47:22,184
You see him?

630
00:47:22,285 --> 00:47:23,518
Yeah.

631
00:47:23,586 --> 00:47:26,555
I got him.

632
00:47:26,656 --> 00:47:29,157
Shoot him.

633
00:47:29,225 --> 00:47:31,293
Just be quiet, Parris.

634
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,034
Did you get him?

635
00:47:41,204 --> 00:47:44,272
No.

636
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:12,254
Identify yourself.

637
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:20,196
I said identify yourself.

638
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,685
Bounty hunters.

639
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:46,188
Worst kind of trash.

640
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:50,126
Cap, get your paper and quill.

641
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,895
Time to put Randall McCoy on notice.

642
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:22,725
Found these horses ground-tied
a few miles out of town.

643
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,628
Figured I'd bring 'em in for the sheriff.

644
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:26,929
Letter pinned on there is addressed

645
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:31,700
to the lawyer Cline and you,
Mr. McCoy.

646
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:45,681
'My name is Nat Hatfield.

647
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:48,818
'I am not one individual but many.'

648
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:53,222
This is as good as a confession.

649
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,258
'We hereby notify you
that if you invade our state

650
00:49:56,359 --> 00:50:01,030
'to take or kill Hatfields,
we will charge it to you.

651
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:04,800
Your hides will pay the penalty.'

652
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:10,339
Devil Anse Hatfield is threatening to kill us,

653
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:11,921
like he done these men.

654
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:15,758
We got it in writing.

655
00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:18,828
We appreciate your help,
Mr. Miller.

656
00:50:18,929 --> 00:50:22,699
Let me get these horses over to the sheriff.

657
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:44,954
Hey, Cotton,
give us another bottle.

658
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:47,590
Cotton, give us a bottle.

659
00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:58,983
I love Johnse Hatfield so much.

660
00:50:59,051 --> 00:51:01,086
Why don't he see that?

661
00:51:01,153 --> 00:51:03,488
On account of you're a whore.

662
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:06,157
Better than some McCoy bitch.

663
00:51:18,037 --> 00:51:20,839
Cap, put down the whiskey,

664
00:51:20,906 --> 00:51:24,075
make like nature calls.

665
00:51:24,176 --> 00:51:27,145
Get my drift.

666
00:51:28,948 --> 00:51:33,451
All right, I'm gonna find me a tree to water.

667
00:51:37,323 --> 00:51:39,023
That's good.

668
00:51:39,091 --> 00:51:42,260
You know, I knew this boy once 30 years ago.

669
00:51:42,361 --> 00:51:43,595
Could hold his hand over that fire

670
00:51:43,696 --> 00:51:46,664
for two minutes and take the pain.

671
00:51:46,732 --> 00:51:49,100
Do you know who that boy was,
Cotton Top?

672
00:51:49,168 --> 00:51:51,936
That was your old uncle Jim Vance.

673
00:51:52,004 --> 00:51:53,738
No.

674
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:56,241
Yes, God's truth.

675
00:52:02,715 --> 00:52:05,917
William 'Cap' Hatfield.

676
00:52:05,985 --> 00:52:07,519
Yeah?

677
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,921
Button your dick,
you vulgar bastard.

678
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:12,991
I'm arresting you for the murder
of Tolbert, phamer, and...

679
00:52:29,642 --> 00:52:32,377
Miller?

680
00:52:32,478 --> 00:52:34,445
Miller, come on, wake up.

681
00:52:43,022 --> 00:52:46,090
Another one of your deputies
what's gonna fix things for ya?

682
00:53:09,315 --> 00:53:12,550
A tele-scop...

683
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:14,118
Scope.
- Scope.

684
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,320
It's a telescope.

685
00:53:15,387 --> 00:53:16,588
Telescope.

686
00:53:16,655 --> 00:53:19,157
For a gun, latest thing.

687
00:53:19,225 --> 00:53:24,095
You shoot a target at 100 yards,
makes it the same as 25.

688
00:53:24,196 --> 00:53:25,897
You joshin' me?

689
00:53:25,965 --> 00:53:28,600
Hard to miss at 25 yards.

690
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:29,867
Yep.

691
00:53:29,935 --> 00:53:32,036
Ordered it near six month ago.

692
00:53:32,137 --> 00:53:34,372
Just arrived by push boat.

693
00:53:34,473 --> 00:53:39,344
Take a look, little brother.

694
00:53:41,647 --> 00:53:45,149
That is one fine purchase.

695
00:53:47,786 --> 00:53:51,389
I figure to use it on old Devil Anse.

696
00:53:56,962 --> 00:54:00,031
Hey, give me that.

697
00:54:00,132 --> 00:54:01,065
Come on.

698
00:54:01,133 --> 00:54:04,135
Take that.

699
00:54:16,715 --> 00:54:17,882
You see him?

700
00:54:17,983 --> 00:54:19,651
Get on the ground behind me.

701
00:54:19,752 --> 00:54:21,552
Don't even breathe.

702
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,121
I got you this time.

703
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:34,365
Oh, God.

704
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:38,536
Hey, Anse!

705
00:54:38,604 --> 00:54:42,707
I do believe we got ourselves a real McCoy!

706
00:54:42,808 --> 00:54:46,444
Cap done shoot 'em dead!

707
00:54:46,512 --> 00:54:48,646
You saved your pappy.

708
00:54:48,714 --> 00:54:50,381
I'm proud of you, son.

709
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:53,723
You are good, boy!

710
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,793
Mama, are you sure you won't eat some?

711
00:54:57,869 --> 00:54:59,003
No, thank you, sweetheart.

712
00:54:59,104 --> 00:55:02,707
I'm fine.

713
00:55:02,774 --> 00:55:05,009
There's something you've been wanting to tell me?

714
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,678
What is it?

715
00:55:07,779 --> 00:55:11,515
Your nephew Parris has been killed.

716
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:12,750
Good lord.

717
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:15,453
Poor Parris.

718
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,188
Got to do something about it,
Randall.

719
00:55:17,255 --> 00:55:21,058
Got more detectives and family
coming back dead every week.

720
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:22,727
You can't keep poking a mad bear with a twig

721
00:55:22,794 --> 00:55:24,695
and making it madder.

722
00:55:24,796 --> 00:55:25,997
We need a big stick,

723
00:55:26,064 --> 00:55:27,965
someone prepared to execute our indictments.

724
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:30,434
Pa...

725
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:33,270
Let me do it.

726
00:55:33,338 --> 00:55:35,306
I'll get my brothers' killers.

727
00:55:35,407 --> 00:55:37,408
I'll be his right hand.

728
00:55:37,509 --> 00:55:39,043
I can fire a gun, pa.

729
00:55:39,144 --> 00:55:41,112
I appreciate it, boys,
but the only success we've had

730
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:42,346
in capturing any of our fugitives

731
00:55:42,447 --> 00:55:44,015
has been with Bad Frank.

732
00:55:44,082 --> 00:55:46,083
I do not like that man.

733
00:55:46,151 --> 00:55:48,252
That man is a Savage.

734
00:55:48,353 --> 00:55:50,655
He's the only one equal to the task.

735
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,958
Can this bad man, the Savage,

736
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:58,696
can he bring me my boys back?

737
00:56:16,548 --> 00:56:20,785
We got a paying customer for ya.

738
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:28,092
Bye, Miss Nancy.

739
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:38,469
Easier seein' president Chester A. Arthur

740
00:56:38,537 --> 00:56:42,473
than passing through these woods
to get your 'shine.

741
00:56:45,644 --> 00:56:47,578
What you want, Nancy?

742
00:56:47,646 --> 00:56:51,882
Purchasin' whiskey for my brother's birthday.

743
00:56:57,289 --> 00:57:00,191
Though I did hear you paid
a visit to my aunt Betty.

744
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,359
I don't much like aunt Betty.

745
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:06,731
When you gonna stop tryin'
to win over my relations?

746
00:57:06,832 --> 00:57:09,533
Only one I care about,

747
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:13,204
your cousin Roseanna,
mother of my baby.

748
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:17,675
Little Sarah Elizabeth is frail and ailing,

749
00:57:17,743 --> 00:57:20,111
and so is Roseanna.

750
00:57:20,212 --> 00:57:22,313
Folks don't expect the child to live much longer.

751
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:26,951
I'm truly sorry, Johnse.

752
00:57:27,018 --> 00:57:29,887
Without the baby, I fear
you'll lose Roseanna too.

753
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:34,492
After all that happened, I...

754
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,361
it seems like she don't want you anymore.

755
00:57:44,636 --> 00:57:47,972
What am I supposed to do?

756
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:52,409
You don't deserve these hard times, Johnse.

757
00:57:53,779 --> 00:57:56,180
You truly don't.

758
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,004
Hah!

759
00:58:20,105 --> 00:58:22,239
Ho, ho, ho.

760
00:58:28,313 --> 00:58:29,780
My lady...

761
00:58:34,953 --> 00:58:36,921
Uncle Wall,

762
00:58:37,022 --> 00:58:38,689
I'd like you to marry us,

763
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:42,059
me and Nancy McCoy.

764
00:58:48,767 --> 00:58:50,234
Jesus H. Christ almighty, boy.

765
00:58:50,335 --> 00:58:51,735
You gone plumb crazy?

766
00:58:51,803 --> 00:58:54,572
No, sir.

767
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:01,612
What about the McCoy woman
you already knocked up?

768
00:59:03,615 --> 00:59:07,051
Yes, sir, well,
that is a sad chapter.

769
00:59:07,152 --> 00:59:11,789
That seems over with... Roseanna,
though, not by my choosin'.

770
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:15,025
You know,
it's different with Nancy.

771
00:59:15,126 --> 00:59:18,629
There ain't no one opposed.

772
00:59:20,532 --> 00:59:22,032
Do your ma and pa know?

773
00:59:22,133 --> 00:59:24,535
You know,
I ain't askin' this time.

774
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,976
Please, uncle Wall.

775
00:59:32,077 --> 00:59:35,646
Me marrying a McCoy could help end

776
00:59:35,714 --> 00:59:38,249
all this dying between our families.

777
00:59:45,323 --> 00:59:47,391
By the power vested in me
by the state of West Virginia,

778
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:51,695
I now pronounce you man and wife.

779
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:54,965
Jefferson, come over here and sign this thing.

780
00:59:55,066 --> 00:59:56,667
Right there.

781
00:59:56,735 --> 00:59:57,868
Let me sign.

782
00:59:57,936 --> 01:00:00,337
Shut up.

783
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,378
You sure you want to do this,
sis?

784
01:00:07,445 --> 01:00:08,612
Smile, little lady.

785
01:00:08,713 --> 01:00:10,681
It's your wedding day.

786
01:00:10,749 --> 01:00:14,852
Man and wife now.

787
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,390
And I expect no more trouble
between us, not ever.

788
01:00:23,461 --> 01:00:26,230
I sure hope you know what you're doin', boy.

789
01:00:26,298 --> 01:00:29,133
I don't know how to tell
y'all this but just say it.

790
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,870
Just come on out with it, Wall.

791
01:00:32,938 --> 01:00:36,640
Yesterday I married Johnse and Nancy McCoy.

792
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:39,877
What?

793
01:00:39,945 --> 01:00:42,079
You married 'em?

794
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,714
Well,
it was damn sure reluctantly.

795
01:00:43,815 --> 01:00:46,650
I can tell you that.

796
01:00:46,751 --> 01:00:48,686
Harmon McCoy's daughter?

797
01:00:48,753 --> 01:00:53,257
Oh, my God.

798
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,626
Well, he was lookin' to be lost to us.

799
01:00:55,727 --> 01:00:57,695
This time,
he just may have succeeded.

800
01:00:57,762 --> 01:00:59,063
Well, Anse,
he thinks it'll make peace

801
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:00,564
between you and Randall.

802
01:01:00,665 --> 01:01:01,932
He does, huh?

803
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,968
Somebody want to tell me how a son of mine

804
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,303
could turn out to be so goddamn dumb?

805
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,309
Cap.

806
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,178
Yeah?

807
01:01:14,279 --> 01:01:16,080
Get your horse.

808
01:01:16,181 --> 01:01:17,481
Go fetch your brother.

809
01:01:21,586 --> 01:01:23,220
No matter how you fortify it,
Anse,

810
01:01:23,321 --> 01:01:26,256
this place is too close
to the tug and open to attack.

811
01:01:26,324 --> 01:01:27,825
As long as that peckerwood Perry Cline

812
01:01:27,926 --> 01:01:29,159
keeps putting up bounties,

813
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,694
the wolves are just gonna keep on comin'.

814
01:01:30,762 --> 01:01:32,896
Oh, Wall, I think we sent Kentucky a notion

815
01:01:32,964 --> 01:01:34,698
of how we deal with bounty hunters.

816
01:01:34,766 --> 01:01:36,433
Damn it, Jim.

817
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:38,168
All I'm sayin' is,
y'all would be better off

818
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,037
deeper in the mountains.

819
01:01:40,138 --> 01:01:43,040
Just to be safe, Anse.

820
01:01:43,141 --> 01:01:48,045
Well, I'll take it under advisement, Wall.

821
01:01:48,146 --> 01:01:51,148
And don't you let Johnse bring
his new McCoy hussy with him.

822
01:01:51,216 --> 01:01:53,751
I'll bring him home, mama.

823
01:02:27,252 --> 01:02:29,486
When you do the trick with me,

824
01:02:29,587 --> 01:02:33,057
are you picturing Roseanna?

825
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,429
Tryin' not to.

826
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:42,132
Tryin' but failin'?

827
01:02:42,233 --> 01:02:46,904
I need more time, I guess.

828
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:50,808
I'll give you time, Johnse.

829
01:02:50,909 --> 01:02:53,811
I can wait a long time for what I want.

830
01:02:53,912 --> 01:02:55,813
Anybody the hell in there?

831
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,982
That's my brother.

832
01:03:00,552 --> 01:03:01,785
Jefferson.

833
01:03:01,886 --> 01:03:04,855
You got to hide me.

834
01:03:04,956 --> 01:03:07,324
Why we got to do that?

835
01:03:07,425 --> 01:03:08,725
Can't let me hang, sis,

836
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,561
not for no fight that I can't even remembers,

837
01:03:10,628 --> 01:03:12,296
'cause I was drunk

838
01:03:12,363 --> 01:03:14,364
and feels terrible about poor Fred Wolford.

839
01:03:14,466 --> 01:03:16,166
Fred Wolford?

840
01:03:16,267 --> 01:03:17,468
The mailman.

841
01:03:17,535 --> 01:03:19,069
We was at a barn dance,

842
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,172
drinking, arguing,
went out back,

843
01:03:22,273 --> 01:03:24,975
commenced to scuffle.

844
01:03:25,076 --> 01:03:26,577
I just give him... I give him a little cut,

845
01:03:26,644 --> 01:03:28,011
and he tried to shoot me.

846
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,413
So I wrenched that gun around,

847
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,515
and I made him shoot his own damn self.

848
01:03:31,616 --> 01:03:33,584
Oh, hell.

849
01:03:33,651 --> 01:03:36,520
He died this morning.

850
01:03:36,621 --> 01:03:37,821
Now they all out there looking for me.

851
01:03:37,922 --> 01:03:39,490
They got a reward out.

852
01:03:39,557 --> 01:03:41,125
Come here, brother.

853
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:43,427
You gonna be all right.

854
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:46,063
All right.

855
01:03:46,164 --> 01:03:49,333
We'll feed you.
You can spend the night here.

856
01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:51,935
You're gonna be safe here,
Jefferson.

857
01:03:52,003 --> 01:03:54,671
For the night.

858
01:03:54,739 --> 01:03:59,009
As long as I'm here.

859
01:04:17,629 --> 01:04:22,299
I don't look like the girl
Johnse romanced no more.

860
01:04:25,537 --> 01:04:28,972
Will he still want me lookin' like this?

861
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,008
Too late to worry about that.

862
01:04:34,279 --> 01:04:36,780
I didn't want to stir the pot,

863
01:04:36,848 --> 01:04:40,951
but here it is.

864
01:04:42,854 --> 01:04:46,390
Johnse's gone and got himself married

865
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:49,493
to your cousin Nancy.

866
01:04:51,963 --> 01:04:55,399
Did you hear me?

867
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,800
Johnse Hatfield

868
01:04:56,868 --> 01:05:01,605
married Nancy McCoy.

869
01:05:08,046 --> 01:05:10,647
Mr. Phillips,
good to see you.

870
01:05:10,748 --> 01:05:13,250
Equally good to see the two of you.

871
01:05:13,318 --> 01:05:16,453
Expect you know why I called
this meeting here this morning.

872
01:05:16,521 --> 01:05:18,722
Y'all are lookin' for someone to lead a posse

873
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,424
across the river,

874
01:05:20,491 --> 01:05:22,092
and I'm the only gun handler around here

875
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,860
who's man enough for the job.

876
01:05:25,697 --> 01:05:27,998
You're awful full of yourself, ain't ya?

877
01:05:28,066 --> 01:05:31,435
I wouldn't call it that.

878
01:05:31,502 --> 01:05:34,404
I wasted some years of my misspent youth

879
01:05:34,505 --> 01:05:36,840
a'ridin' with Jesse and Frank.

880
01:05:36,941 --> 01:05:40,177
Once got to witness wild bill kill a man,

881
01:05:40,245 --> 01:05:41,612
so I seen better than me,

882
01:05:41,713 --> 01:05:45,115
though not many.

883
01:05:45,216 --> 01:05:47,417
And I can't help but see
what you got to choose from.

884
01:05:50,788 --> 01:05:53,624
I didn't realize you'd once been an outlaw.

885
01:05:53,691 --> 01:05:55,859
Oh, that, of course,
was before I was saved,

886
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,896
long prior to my being washed clean of sin

887
01:05:59,964 --> 01:06:03,734
by the blood of our lord and savior Jesus Christ.

888
01:06:03,801 --> 01:06:06,703
You sure don't act Christian.

889
01:06:06,804 --> 01:06:10,574
I'm a warrior for God,
Mr. McCoy,

890
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,610
a fighter of evil,

891
01:06:13,711 --> 01:06:16,613
right and ready to take on your demon murderers.

892
01:06:18,082 --> 01:06:20,617
I heard you were a Pinkerton man.

893
01:06:20,718 --> 01:06:22,686
I was,

894
01:06:22,787 --> 01:06:25,022
till I got shot in the back by Hatfields,

895
01:06:25,089 --> 01:06:28,292
left me with my limp,

896
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,260
another reason that warrants my hiring.

897
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:37,534
I bear Devil Anse Hatfield and
all his kin a personal grudge.

898
01:06:54,919 --> 01:06:56,453
Now, let me get this straight.

899
01:06:56,554 --> 01:07:00,190
Now, Randall wants his governor
to make our governor arrest us

900
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:01,792
and cart us over to Kentucky?

901
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:03,360
It's called extradition, Elias,

902
01:07:03,461 --> 01:07:07,731
and I don't think our governor
Wilson will agree to it.

903
01:07:07,832 --> 01:07:09,800
Well, I got my own ace in this poker game.

904
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:12,869
My friend John Floyd works
with Windy at the capital now.

905
01:07:12,937 --> 01:07:16,840
Yes, sir, our new assistant secretary of state.

906
01:07:16,941 --> 01:07:18,375
John will help out.

907
01:07:18,476 --> 01:07:20,477
It's Cap and Johnse.

908
01:07:22,647 --> 01:07:23,947
How do we handle this boy,
'vicy?

909
01:07:24,015 --> 01:07:28,118
Well, not by pushin' and pullin' him.

910
01:07:28,219 --> 01:07:31,922
That's what drove him into
the arms of another McCoy.

911
01:07:34,225 --> 01:07:37,494
You want to untie this knot...

912
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,763
You get her to hate him.

913
01:07:54,212 --> 01:07:57,147
Take your hat off in here.

914
01:08:00,017 --> 01:08:03,720
So...
How's the married man?

915
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:07,324
Doin' just fine, uncle Wall,
just fine.

916
01:08:07,425 --> 01:08:09,493
So marriage suits you then,
huh?

917
01:08:09,594 --> 01:08:11,161
Yes, sir,
right down to the ground.

918
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:15,499
She must be one sorry-ass cook.

919
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,535
You choosin' a ham supper over
a comely McCoy bride.

920
01:08:18,603 --> 01:08:20,070
She ain't McCoy no more,
is she?

921
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:23,373
She's Hatfield,
Mrs. Johnse Hatfield.

922
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:26,476
Hatfield ain't just a name on a piece of paper.

923
01:08:26,577 --> 01:08:30,680
Don't expect to bring her
around here like the last one.

924
01:08:30,782 --> 01:08:32,682
Things get spoke that ain't for McCoy ears.

925
01:08:32,784 --> 01:08:34,584
Well,
I didn't bring her here, did I?

926
01:08:34,685 --> 01:08:36,186
Don't sass your father.

927
01:08:36,254 --> 01:08:38,155
Your horndog philanderin' helped make this mess.

928
01:08:38,256 --> 01:08:40,524
Mama, please, you know what?
I get enough grief at home.

929
01:08:40,591 --> 01:08:43,794
Truth be told,
I need to get away for a bit.

930
01:08:43,895 --> 01:08:46,663
It ain't her, you know.

931
01:08:46,764 --> 01:08:48,131
Nancy treats me fine.

932
01:08:48,232 --> 01:08:50,133
It's just...

933
01:08:50,234 --> 01:08:54,171
Her gol'dang brother is turning
my honeymoon into misery.

934
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,406
Jefferson McCoy?

935
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,241
I heard he killed the mailman the other day.

936
01:08:58,342 --> 01:09:00,043
Got a gol'dang reward up too.

937
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:06,349
You're harborin' a McCoy
with a price on his head?

938
01:09:06,451 --> 01:09:08,785
Nancy says it's just for a while,

939
01:09:08,886 --> 01:09:12,556
says it's her duty to protect him.

940
01:09:12,623 --> 01:09:15,592
Well, loyal sis.

941
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,360
How much is the reward?

942
01:09:17,428 --> 01:09:19,162
I don't know.

943
01:09:19,263 --> 01:09:21,998
$100 maybe.

944
01:09:22,066 --> 01:09:25,802
Well, we just want you to be happy, son.

945
01:09:28,272 --> 01:09:31,107
Why don't you take a little time
away from home, hmm?

946
01:09:31,175 --> 01:09:33,543
Wouldn't hurt none.

947
01:09:33,644 --> 01:09:37,080
Go huntin' with your pa.

948
01:09:39,784 --> 01:09:42,552
It's true; I ain't been huntin' for a spell.

949
01:09:44,522 --> 01:09:46,256
You up to goin' with me, Johnse?

950
01:09:46,357 --> 01:09:47,791
That'd be nice.

951
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:50,293
I don't know.
Yeah, might as well.

952
01:09:50,361 --> 01:09:54,397
Shit, better than watching
my layabout brother-in-law

953
01:09:54,465 --> 01:09:55,932
drink up all my whiskey profits,
right?

954
01:09:57,201 --> 01:09:58,535
Amen to that.

955
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,896
I believe that's a Jefferson McCoy.

956
01:10:25,997 --> 01:10:27,998
Who's sayin' that?

957
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:32,235
Johnse Hatfield's uncle Jim Vance

958
01:10:32,303 --> 01:10:34,938
and his little brother Cap.

959
01:10:35,006 --> 01:10:36,907
Where's... where's Johnse?

960
01:10:37,008 --> 01:10:39,943
Out huntin' with his pa.

961
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:42,646
So what you doin' here?

962
01:10:45,483 --> 01:10:46,917
Doin' a little hunting ourselves.

963
01:10:47,018 --> 01:10:50,587
Well...
Not much huntin' around here.

964
01:10:50,655 --> 01:10:55,325
Place is all shot out of deer and such.

965
01:10:55,393 --> 01:10:59,429
Oh,
there's still critters here.

966
01:10:59,497 --> 01:11:02,666
And one critter in particular

967
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:05,368
has a handsome reward on his head.

968
01:11:08,773 --> 01:11:10,140
Nancy!

969
01:11:10,207 --> 01:11:11,708
What are you doing to my brother?

970
01:11:11,776 --> 01:11:13,310
Nancy, do something!
They gonna take me in!

971
01:11:13,377 --> 01:11:14,878
Get off!

972
01:11:14,946 --> 01:11:16,846
You get back in that cabin,
Miss McCoy.

973
01:11:16,948 --> 01:11:18,148
You get yourself dressed proper.

974
01:11:18,215 --> 01:11:19,883
Get off him, you old coot!

975
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:22,118
What the hell you gonna do?

976
01:11:22,219 --> 01:11:25,355
Nancy!

977
01:11:27,558 --> 01:11:29,192
Damn it.

978
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:33,029
I'll show you.

979
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:34,331
Come on.

980
01:11:34,398 --> 01:11:35,865
Get 'em, Nancy!

981
01:11:37,134 --> 01:11:39,135
Get off me, you...

982
01:11:39,236 --> 01:11:40,270
you bitch!

983
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:41,905
You good for nothing bitch!

984
01:11:41,973 --> 01:11:43,206
Let go!

985
01:11:43,307 --> 01:11:44,240
You want to do some whippin'?

986
01:11:44,308 --> 01:11:45,742
Here's some whippin', girl.

987
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:47,644
Don't let him do that to you!

988
01:11:47,745 --> 01:11:50,981
Yeah, bet you like that,
don't you, you mean little...

989
01:11:51,048 --> 01:11:52,482
Get off of her, Vance!

990
01:11:52,583 --> 01:11:53,683
Stop it, Jim.

991
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:58,655
Stop it, Jim.

992
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:06,663
He's gettin' away.

993
01:12:58,082 --> 01:12:59,582
Come on, Cap.

994
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:00,784
We're gonna lose him.

995
01:13:00,885 --> 01:13:03,620
Stabilize me.

996
01:13:09,827 --> 01:13:11,394
I ain't drowned!

997
01:13:11,462 --> 01:13:14,597
Come on.
- You Hatfield morons!

998
01:13:14,699 --> 01:13:16,499
Come and get me!

999
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,035
Goddang pecker-pullers!

1000
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,170
What's the matter with you?

1001
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:21,871
Can't swim?

1002
01:13:21,972 --> 01:13:24,874
Go ahead, shoot, you fog-eyed,
half-blind bastard!

1003
01:13:24,975 --> 01:13:26,509
Here I am!

1004
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:29,813
You one-eyed ape, it's 1/2 mile!

1005
01:13:36,554 --> 01:13:38,188
Yeah!

1006
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:39,556
A hole in the head.

1007
01:13:41,092 --> 01:13:42,826
You did good, boy.

1008
01:13:58,943 --> 01:14:03,513
Nancy?

1009
01:14:03,581 --> 01:14:05,682
Jesus.

1010
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:08,251
Somebody bashed you?

1011
01:14:08,352 --> 01:14:10,520
Oh, my God.

1012
01:14:10,588 --> 01:14:15,091
Jim Vance beat me like I was a mule, worse.

1013
01:14:15,192 --> 01:14:16,526
Uncle Jim?

1014
01:14:16,627 --> 01:14:19,028
He did disgusting things to me.

1015
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:22,098
Him and Cap come in here and take Jefferson.

1016
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:24,567
Now, you tell me true whether you had anything

1017
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:25,664
to do with that.

1018
01:14:25,732 --> 01:14:29,835
I swear to you I didn't.

1019
01:14:29,902 --> 01:14:33,138
Nancy, I swear it.

1020
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:36,475
Well, then you go,
and you get after 'em,

1021
01:14:36,542 --> 01:14:39,711
and you bring my brother back here.

1022
01:14:39,812 --> 01:14:41,713
You go on and do that.

1023
01:14:41,814 --> 01:14:42,848
You do that for me.

1024
01:14:42,915 --> 01:14:45,283
Damn it.

1025
01:14:48,554 --> 01:14:49,921
Get!

1026
01:14:49,989 --> 01:14:51,223
I can't, Nance.

1027
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:53,892
Can't or you won't?

1028
01:14:53,993 --> 01:14:57,062
I can't.

1029
01:14:57,163 --> 01:14:59,531
It's already been played out.

1030
01:14:59,632 --> 01:15:03,201
I seen my... my brother Cap down the road.

1031
01:15:05,571 --> 01:15:08,406
Jefferson tried to run.

1032
01:15:08,474 --> 01:15:10,108
Cap had to shoot him.

1033
01:15:13,846 --> 01:15:16,214
Jefferson's killed, Nancy.

1034
01:15:16,282 --> 01:15:20,986
Oh.

1035
01:15:21,087 --> 01:15:23,789
No.
Now I ain't got no one.

1036
01:15:23,856 --> 01:15:28,560
Hey, hey, hey.

1037
01:15:28,661 --> 01:15:30,262
All of 'em dead.

1038
01:15:34,467 --> 01:15:36,835
Now I ain't got nobody.

1039
01:15:40,039 --> 01:15:42,741
Now my brother's dead.

1040
01:15:42,842 --> 01:15:43,942
You got me.

1041
01:15:44,043 --> 01:15:45,477
You st...
- No!

1042
01:15:45,578 --> 01:15:47,179
You still got me.
- Stop it, damn it!

1043
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,647
Come here.
- Don't touch me!

1044
01:15:48,748 --> 01:15:49,815
Stop it!

1045
01:15:49,916 --> 01:15:51,483
I don't want you here!

1046
01:15:51,584 --> 01:15:53,151
No!

1047
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:54,152
Hey.

1048
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:55,420
No.

1049
01:15:55,488 --> 01:15:57,856
No.

1050
01:15:57,957 --> 01:16:00,258
Damn it.

1051
01:16:00,326 --> 01:16:01,860
Get out of here.

1052
01:16:01,961 --> 01:16:03,128
Get!

1053
01:16:03,229 --> 01:16:06,097
Get out of here!

1054
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:09,801
Why you want to be on the posse?

1055
01:16:09,869 --> 01:16:11,837
I don't like Hatfields.

1056
01:16:11,938 --> 01:16:13,238
Were you in the army?

1057
01:16:13,306 --> 01:16:16,474
I tried to enlist, both sides.

1058
01:16:16,576 --> 01:16:18,743
There was something awry with my genitals.

1059
01:16:21,047 --> 01:16:22,647
It prevent you from riding a horse?

1060
01:16:22,715 --> 01:16:23,949
Oh, not anymore.

1061
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:25,851
And I'm a fine shot.

1062
01:16:25,952 --> 01:16:28,553
I can hit a rat's ass at 40 yards.

1063
01:16:28,654 --> 01:16:30,622
You leave word where to find
you when it comes to that.

1064
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:35,594
Next.

1065
01:16:35,695 --> 01:16:37,696
My name is Ransom Bray.

1066
01:16:37,763 --> 01:16:39,698
I am armed and ready to ride.

1067
01:16:39,765 --> 01:16:43,101
And I'll take on your fight
and anyone or anything

1068
01:16:43,202 --> 01:16:46,972
you put in front of me.

1069
01:16:47,073 --> 01:16:50,609
Mr. Phillips, I ain't here to just join a posse.

1070
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:53,211
I want to be your personal deputy,

1071
01:16:53,312 --> 01:16:55,347
'cause I work hard,
and I wouldn't say...

1072
01:16:55,414 --> 01:16:57,215
got any law enforcement experience?

1073
01:16:57,316 --> 01:17:02,754
Well, I... I want to learn the occupation,

1074
01:17:02,855 --> 01:17:04,623
'cause I know I'd be good at it.

1075
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:08,693
I ain't gonna give you no guff.

1076
01:17:12,131 --> 01:17:15,667
All right, look,
you take me on,

1077
01:17:15,768 --> 01:17:18,803
and I'll even split my wages with you.

1078
01:17:23,709 --> 01:17:25,443
Well, sir,

1079
01:17:25,544 --> 01:17:29,347
let me talk to Mr. Cline and Mr. McCoy about you.

1080
01:17:29,448 --> 01:17:33,718
Lady upstairs wanting to talk to you.

1081
01:17:33,786 --> 01:17:36,888
Gentlemen, I'll be back.

1082
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:59,244
Man downstairs said you had something to tell me.

1083
01:18:01,614 --> 01:18:04,916
How would you like to know
where Selkirk McCoy is,

1084
01:18:04,984 --> 01:18:07,185
traitor that killed his own kin?

1085
01:18:07,286 --> 01:18:09,421
What would you want in return?

1086
01:18:11,791 --> 01:18:16,328
For you to kill Jim Vance,
man that did this to my face...

1087
01:18:16,429 --> 01:18:18,463
worse than that,
killed my brother and my pap.

1088
01:18:25,938 --> 01:18:30,675
Jim Vance is on the list.

1089
01:18:30,743 --> 01:18:35,313
Sooner or later we gonna get every damn one.

1090
01:18:35,381 --> 01:18:38,350
Not just get 'em, kill 'em.

1091
01:18:41,287 --> 01:18:44,990
You can demonstrate on Selkirk.

1092
01:18:45,091 --> 01:18:49,661
He's workin' down in
beckleyville using a fake name.

1093
01:18:51,263 --> 01:18:54,065
Want me to kill him too?

1094
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:55,400
Makes me no never mind.

1095
01:18:55,468 --> 01:18:58,003
It's Jim Vance I hate.

1096
01:19:01,374 --> 01:19:04,009
And just one other thing.

1097
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:10,215
Just leave Johnse Hatfield be...

1098
01:19:10,316 --> 01:19:12,083
for now.

1099
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,978
Ready?

1100
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:32,347
Up.

1101
01:19:32,448 --> 01:19:35,050
Selkirk McCoy, the kin killer.

1102
01:19:35,151 --> 01:19:37,953
Yes, sir, I believe that's you.

1103
01:19:38,054 --> 01:19:39,755
Well, you got me wrong, sir.

1104
01:19:39,822 --> 01:19:40,922
Name's bidwell.

1105
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:43,058
Stop the horseshit.

1106
01:19:43,159 --> 01:19:45,527
You're Selkirk McCoy,
and we damn well know it.

1107
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:48,663
Don't... don't kill me.

1108
01:19:48,731 --> 01:19:50,198
Don't kill me.
I give up.

1109
01:19:50,266 --> 01:19:52,434
I give up.
You got me dead to rights.

1110
01:19:52,535 --> 01:19:54,202
A man who'd shoot his own cousins,

1111
01:19:54,303 --> 01:19:56,171
I don't expect he'd let himself get taken alive.

1112
01:19:56,272 --> 01:19:57,773
Make your play.

1113
01:19:57,874 --> 01:19:59,174
I ain't wearin' no gun.

1114
01:19:59,275 --> 01:20:00,876
My hands are up.

1115
01:20:00,977 --> 01:20:03,812
I won't deny a man his right to defend hisself.

1116
01:20:03,913 --> 01:20:05,580
I'll count to five,
and you go for it.

1117
01:20:05,648 --> 01:20:06,882
One, two...

1118
01:20:06,983 --> 01:20:08,383
Aaron, you tell him I'll surrender!

1119
01:20:08,451 --> 01:20:09,718
Three.

1120
01:20:09,819 --> 01:20:11,153
I'm gettin' down on the floor.

1121
01:20:11,254 --> 01:20:13,388
I'm helpless.
I surrender.

1122
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:14,876
You got a witness right there.

1123
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:16,611
He knows I give myself up.

1124
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:19,180
Yeah,
real-life Judas Iscariot.

1125
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:20,648
Don't do it, Mister.

1126
01:20:20,716 --> 01:20:21,950
It ain't right.

1127
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:24,752
Maybe you're right.

1128
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,621
Maybe he ain't worth the price of a bullet.

1129
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,457
That's right.
No, sir.

1130
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:41,602
Hit me, Cap.

1131
01:20:41,704 --> 01:20:44,072
Ooh.

1132
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:45,206
It's me.

1133
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:46,441
Open the damn door.

1134
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:49,243
He's alone.

1135
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,281
Hey, sugar.

1136
01:21:06,729 --> 01:21:08,329
You insane, boy?

1137
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,598
That's right, Johnse.
Don't give up.

1138
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,467
Whoa.

1139
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:16,404
Come on, Johnse.

1140
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:19,240
Yeah!
- You shut up.

1141
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:24,946
Why'd you do it, uncle Jim?

1142
01:21:25,014 --> 01:21:26,347
What the hell?
Do what?

1143
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:33,187
Get your money, Cap.

1144
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:35,123
Let's get 'em.

1145
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:36,991
All right, now.

1146
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:38,926
Get off him.

1147
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:47,835
I'm gonna kill you!

1148
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:49,303
You monster!

1149
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:51,372
Nancy says you damn near raped her!

1150
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:52,607
That's a lie!

1151
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:54,342
That bitch came at me first.

1152
01:21:54,443 --> 01:21:56,411
That's my wife you're talking about, God damn it.

1153
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:57,912
Johnse, sit down.

1154
01:21:58,013 --> 01:21:59,147
You're drunk.

1155
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:01,015
Sit, sit.

1156
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:07,722
The only way I could come here was liquored up.

1157
01:22:07,823 --> 01:22:10,858
I hate goin' up against my family like this.

1158
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,894
Uncle Jim's right about Nancy comin' after him.

1159
01:22:12,995 --> 01:22:14,796
She started whippin' him with a cow's tail.

1160
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:17,331
Pret'near took my eye out,
she did.

1161
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:22,070
I had to jerk that thing out
of her hand to save myself.

1162
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:24,072
I'm sorry, Johnse.

1163
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:28,609
Well... You know.

1164
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:31,612
You hear about Selkirk?

1165
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:35,450
That Bad Frank prick hauled
him off to Pikeville jail.

1166
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:39,387
How did he know where he was,
Johnse?

1167
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,622
Selkirk was incognito.

1168
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:45,059
Only us Hatfields knew where he was.

1169
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:52,100
I am foursquare Hatfield,

1170
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:54,469
front and back, dawn to dusk.

1171
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:04,612
Yeah, well, that's why
emotions are runnin' so wild,

1172
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:09,417
because there's a spy amongst us.

1173
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:19,794
Whoa.

1174
01:23:19,895 --> 01:23:22,296
Papers come through.

1175
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:25,166
It's official.

1176
01:23:27,803 --> 01:23:30,605
'Special deputy,
state of Kentucky,

1177
01:23:30,706 --> 01:23:32,807
Mr. Frank Phillips.'

1178
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:35,309
Sent by governor Simon Buckner.

1179
01:23:38,147 --> 01:23:40,515
You should be very pleased,
Mr. Phillips.

1180
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:48,656
Men, should you meet resistance,

1181
01:23:48,724 --> 01:23:51,959
you'll use no more force
than is necessary to prevail.

1182
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:55,129
We are not infidels like the Hatfields.

1183
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:59,167
We embody the law.

1184
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:00,501
Let us pray.

1185
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,339
Dear lord,

1186
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,976
may you be with us today and bless our endeavors.

1187
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:13,781
Amen.

1188
01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:18,719
Years past,
you'd have lead the charge

1189
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,555
and fixed this mess yourself.

1190
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:24,926
Today you best leave it to the younger men.

1191
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:26,360
He killed my boys.

1192
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:27,795
This is my fight.

1193
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,665
Your sons can ride in your stead.

1194
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:34,735
With dignified regard,
Mr. McCoy, you ain't deputized.

1195
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:36,637
He's right, Randall.

1196
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:41,175
You're the one who insists this all be legal.

1197
01:24:43,345 --> 01:24:45,346
Yah.

1198
01:24:47,282 --> 01:24:48,516
Let's ride!

1199
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,442
Our boys will be fine.

1200
01:25:14,543 --> 01:25:16,210
I thought you were goin' off with 'em.

1201
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:21,983
Mm, they reckon I'm too old and shaky.

1202
01:25:22,084 --> 01:25:25,353
I'd slow 'em down.

1203
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:30,358
They're young men.

1204
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:32,460
We should pray for their safety.

1205
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:36,897
You ever get tired of praying, Randall?

1206
01:25:36,999 --> 01:25:39,400
Seems like it so rarely works.

1207
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:42,803
It's not ours to question God's will.

1208
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:47,074
That's what faith's for.

1209
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:50,011
Don't be fearful, mother.

1210
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:55,483
Gets awful dark in these woods at night.

1211
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,585
We could use some of Tom Edison's

1212
01:25:57,686 --> 01:25:59,220
electric lightnin' bulbs.

1213
01:26:01,757 --> 01:26:05,793
There's so much I wanted to give you,

1214
01:26:05,861 --> 01:26:09,096
so much, Sally.

1215
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:11,932
But all I brought you is pain in this life.

1216
01:26:12,034 --> 01:26:14,869
Others have, but not you.

1217
01:26:19,975 --> 01:26:24,045
You always believe what you say,
Randall.

1218
01:26:24,146 --> 01:26:27,481
That is a rare quality,
and I admire you for it.

1219
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:33,220
That why you married me?

1220
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:36,891
I married you, because one day,

1221
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:39,960
you're gonna buy me that electric double boiler.

1222
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:58,045
Where's the guards?

1223
01:26:58,146 --> 01:26:59,213
I don't know.

1224
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:01,515
Maybe waiting to ambush us.

1225
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:34,382
There ain't nobody here,
Mr. Phillips.

1226
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:38,018
Food on the stove,
plates on the table.

1227
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:39,920
Let's wait till they get back.

1228
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:43,190
Devil ain't comin' back.

1229
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:47,928
Heard us comin' and gone deep in the hills.

1230
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:50,898
Least we got him on the run.

1231
01:27:56,238 --> 01:28:00,708
Now, we got others to go fetch.

1232
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:18,125
Wake up, frenchy,
you lazy son of a bitch.

1233
01:28:18,193 --> 01:28:20,995
Don't kick me, Lark,
you asshole.

1234
01:28:34,109 --> 01:28:35,843
Lark Varney!

1235
01:28:35,944 --> 01:28:37,711
French Ellis!

1236
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:39,747
Come on outside!

1237
01:28:39,848 --> 01:28:42,383
We'll give you one chance!

1238
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:43,884
Well, who are you?

1239
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:46,487
Deputy marshals out of pike county!

1240
01:28:46,555 --> 01:28:48,889
We got warrants!

1241
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:53,227
Toss out your guns and come on out!

1242
01:29:02,571 --> 01:29:05,172
We're lookin' for Devil Anse Hatfield!

1243
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:08,576
Either one of you mush-heads
know where he went to?

1244
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,377
Hey, that you, Ransom Bray?

1245
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:12,446
Hey, I know you!

1246
01:29:12,547 --> 01:29:14,648
Yeah, I'm friends with the fella
that's humpin' your sister

1247
01:29:14,749 --> 01:29:15,916
Ruth-Anne back home!

1248
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:20,087
Thought maybe I'd look her up myself,

1249
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,223
but the line's too long!

1250
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:25,926
Ah!

1251
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,767
I think they killed me,
frenchy.

1252
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:35,269
I'm g... I'm gutshot.

1253
01:29:35,337 --> 01:29:37,037
Tell us where the Hatfields run off to,

1254
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:38,172
and we'll spare you!

1255
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,040
Hey, Lark.
- Come on out!

1256
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:41,775
They shot me, frenchy.

1257
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,043
Come on.
Drink some of this.

1258
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:48,782
You got to stay with me, Lark.

1259
01:29:51,019 --> 01:29:53,187
Okay, I'm freightin' you out.

1260
01:29:53,288 --> 01:29:54,321
Okay.
- Okay?

1261
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:56,190
Okay.

1262
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:57,925
You put up a good show,
and I'll make a run for it,

1263
01:29:58,026 --> 01:29:59,193
circle behind 'em.

1264
01:29:59,294 --> 01:30:02,329
Okay.
- Okay, come on.

1265
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:06,300
Come on.

1266
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:07,968
All right, we're comin'.

1267
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:09,303
Hold your fire.

1268
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:12,239
Lark will tell you about the Hatfields.

1269
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,575
All right,
you break to the right,

1270
01:30:14,676 --> 01:30:19,413
and I'll go left, okay?

1271
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:40,801
All right, I quit this fight!

1272
01:30:43,071 --> 01:30:44,438
Here's my gun!

1273
01:30:57,419 --> 01:30:58,953
Hell, if I'd have known y'all was comin',

1274
01:30:59,054 --> 01:31:00,921
I'd have put my Sunday best on.

1275
01:31:00,989 --> 01:31:05,759
French, you're under arrest for your part

1276
01:31:05,827 --> 01:31:10,497
in the illegal execution
of the sons of Randall McCoy.

1277
01:31:10,599 --> 01:31:13,867
How you know my sister Ruth-Anne?

1278
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:15,936
McCoy boys.

1279
01:31:16,004 --> 01:31:19,740
Calvin, Jim, I see y'all were
takin' up your daddy's war.

1280
01:31:22,911 --> 01:31:25,980
Jesus, you already got Alex and Charlie?

1281
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:28,449
You know, that other fella I don't recognize.

1282
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:30,784
I mean, y'all just round up
anybody you come across?

1283
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:32,219
All you need to know is,

1284
01:31:32,287 --> 01:31:33,687
this here warrant has your name on it.

1285
01:31:33,788 --> 01:31:36,857
Yeah, reckon I'm gonna hang,

1286
01:31:36,925 --> 01:31:39,293
be a big disappointment to my family.

1287
01:31:39,361 --> 01:31:40,961
Well, take us straightaway to Devil Anse,

1288
01:31:41,029 --> 01:31:43,130
you won't have to ride in the cage.

1289
01:31:43,198 --> 01:31:45,232
How do you know my sister?

1290
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,935
Hell, everybody pass through bluefield

1291
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:50,004
gets a pork job from Ruth-Anne Bray.

1292
01:31:54,743 --> 01:31:56,543
What the hell?

1293
01:31:56,645 --> 01:31:58,479
Made one damn remark too many.

1294
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:01,515
He was takin' us to Devil Anse!

1295
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:05,586
He don't know where Hatfield is!

1296
01:32:05,654 --> 01:32:07,855
French Ellis was always a fat liar.

1297
01:32:07,922 --> 01:32:09,356
How do you know him?

1298
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:12,226
We was in school together,
the one year I went.

1299
01:32:15,664 --> 01:32:18,632
The way I fire asswipe morons is,

1300
01:32:18,661 --> 01:32:20,562
I put a bullet in their goddamn heads.

1301
01:32:20,663 --> 01:32:22,965
Won't happen again.

1302
01:32:23,019 --> 01:32:24,119
Apologize.

1303
01:32:27,457 --> 01:32:29,658
We got to do this right.

1304
01:32:30,827 --> 01:32:32,127
Politic!

1305
01:32:34,297 --> 01:32:37,232
No more trail justice,
you hear?

1306
01:32:39,102 --> 01:32:41,837
I might want to be sheriff one day.

1307
01:33:07,697 --> 01:33:11,133
Hey.

1308
01:33:11,234 --> 01:33:13,769
I picked up our ammo and our winchesters.

1309
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:14,970
Good.

1310
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:16,891
Dumb McCoy's raiding all the push boats;

1311
01:33:16,992 --> 01:33:18,292
Didn't think to check the mail wagon.

1312
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,761
Yeah.
- Is it true?

1313
01:33:20,829 --> 01:33:22,363
Governor Wilson in there?

1314
01:33:22,464 --> 01:33:23,598
Next best thing.

1315
01:33:23,665 --> 01:33:26,467
He sent his boy John B. Floyd.

1316
01:33:27,569 --> 01:33:29,136
No, no, no.

1317
01:33:29,204 --> 01:33:31,372
John, now,
I want you to understand this.

1318
01:33:31,473 --> 01:33:34,775
Now, what we got here is Lark Varney,

1319
01:33:34,843 --> 01:33:37,078
French Ellis,
Skunkhair Wallace,

1320
01:33:37,179 --> 01:33:38,946
all of them dead.

1321
01:33:39,014 --> 01:33:43,184
Then we got Alex Messer,
Selkirk... pliant men...

1322
01:33:43,285 --> 01:33:45,052
about a half dozen others kidnapped.

1323
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,621
I hear you, Wall.

1324
01:33:46,722 --> 01:33:48,189
It's hard to know how many of our relations

1325
01:33:48,384 --> 01:33:50,118
they've buried in unmarked graves.

1326
01:33:50,219 --> 01:33:52,887
Why, you have governor
Wilson's complete support, Anse.

1327
01:33:52,955 --> 01:33:54,489
He's doin' everything he can.

1328
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:56,124
Well, it's pretty clear it ain't enough.

1329
01:33:56,225 --> 01:33:58,193
I petitioned the U.S. district court

1330
01:33:58,294 --> 01:34:01,329
for writs of habeas corpus
on our imprisoned citizens.

1331
01:34:01,397 --> 01:34:04,933
Now, governor Wilson has had a heated exchange

1332
01:34:05,034 --> 01:34:07,102
of telegrams with governor Buckner.

1333
01:34:07,203 --> 01:34:08,570
Heated exchange?

1334
01:34:08,572 --> 01:34:09,905
Yes, sir.

1335
01:34:10,007 --> 01:34:11,574
Hear that, Wall?
They had a...

1336
01:34:13,210 --> 01:34:14,710
They had themselves a heated exchange.

1337
01:34:14,811 --> 01:34:16,779
Mm.

1338
01:34:16,847 --> 01:34:19,448
Give me troopers at the border, John,

1339
01:34:19,549 --> 01:34:22,084
troopers at the border,

1340
01:34:22,185 --> 01:34:25,054
so when McCoy tries it again,
you stop his ass.

1341
01:34:25,122 --> 01:34:30,092
John, John, what these son'
bitches are doin' is illegal.

1342
01:34:30,193 --> 01:34:33,162
Ain't no out-of-state lawman
got the right to invade

1343
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:35,698
another sovereign state to abduct citizens,

1344
01:34:35,766 --> 01:34:37,400
warrant or no damn warrant.

1345
01:34:37,501 --> 01:34:40,736
I sent an official requisition to Kentucky

1346
01:34:40,837 --> 01:34:42,638
calling for the arrest of Frank Phillips

1347
01:34:42,739 --> 01:34:44,473
and 23 members of his posse.

1348
01:34:44,574 --> 01:34:46,142
Kentucky ain't gonna do nothin'.

1349
01:34:46,243 --> 01:34:49,011
But if they try to invade West Virginia again,

1350
01:34:49,112 --> 01:34:53,482
Mr. McCoy's posse can be arrested here.

1351
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:57,153
Mmhmm, by who?

1352
01:34:59,489 --> 01:35:02,091
Ah, hell, deputize us.

1353
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:04,493
Give us a few Cannon,
we'll ride into Pikeville,

1354
01:35:04,594 --> 01:35:06,228
end this shit right now.

1355
01:35:06,329 --> 01:35:09,198
Sir, you are talkin' about
startin' another civil war.

1356
01:35:09,299 --> 01:35:12,668
That's not talk, John.

1357
01:35:12,769 --> 01:35:15,671
That's what we already got.

1358
01:35:15,772 --> 01:35:18,574
So you tell the governor...

1359
01:35:18,675 --> 01:35:22,144
He steps in, or I will.
