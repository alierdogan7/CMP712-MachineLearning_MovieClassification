1
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:23,077
THE OIL, THE BABY AND THE
TRANSYLVANIANS

2
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:49,384
Romi....

3
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,431
I think that Ion is drunk
somewhere.

4
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:54,004
Maybe he's at the theater.

5
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:58,780
What's that mean?

6
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,798
It was a joke.

7
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:01,975
Please forgive me.

8
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:07,452
I forgive you.

9
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:08,526
Hey...

10
00:05:09,147 --> 00:05:12,293
Why did he take his gun if he was only 
going to collect his money?

11
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:15,157
I don't know.

12
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:18,712
Maybe it is the tradition around here.

13
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,669
- Shepherd?
- Yes? - He's not coming.

14
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,683
I can see that.

15
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:27,943
I hope that he doesn't...

16
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:32,236
That he doesn't what?

17
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:33,950
Do something foolish!

18
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:35,853
What sort of foolishness?

19
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,263
How do we know that he'll find...

20
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,578
the one who owes
him money.

21
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:51,278
C'mon, we're going
to the fire.

22
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:53,293
To get warmed up.

23
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:57,498
- Romi.
- Yes?

24
00:09:57,912 --> 00:10:00,813
I miss Bob.

25
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:02,678
I liked him a lot.

26
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:07,552
You liked him, but it
was necessary for him to marry.

27
00:18:28,785 --> 00:18:29,845
Ion, is that you?

28
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,228
Thank God that you're
here.

29
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,837
What's wrong with him?

30
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:46,829
Have you brought it?

31
00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:49,537
- What?
- The money.

32
00:18:52,374 --> 00:18:52,851
Yes.

33
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:56,706
My dears, I think I'll change
my opinion about America.

34
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,695
It looks like you can find
honest people here too.

35
00:19:00,254 --> 00:19:02,550
And now I'm wondering
why you're late.

36
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:05,648
Maybe it took time while that
man earned the money he owed.

37
00:19:06,016 --> 00:19:09,157
How could he know that
you needed it?

38
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:10,565
Like you said.

39
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,283
How the fuck could he know?

40
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:14,561
Girl, up!

41
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:15,601
We'll take the mail coach.

42
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,675
Romi, go and buy some
tickets!

43
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:20,015
Ion, give him some money!
What is it?

44
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:22,471
What "please"?

45
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:30,849
This happens when you take
women with you.

46
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:35,441
You don't know what you're talking about.
Can't you see that she's tired?

47
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:39,604
- So shut up!
- Thanks brother, for the lack of respect.

48
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:42,029
What is your opinion?

49
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:44,087
A few days wait wont
be the end of the world.

50
00:19:44,397 --> 00:19:46,346
Maybe for you, because
you're young.

51
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,530
But if you really want to,
then we should stay.

52
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,981
Take the money,
shepherd.

53
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,295
You keep hold of it.

54
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:55,900
Take it.

55
00:19:57,568 --> 00:19:58,673
Give it to him.

56
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:02,095
He thinks that he is smarter than 
the Pope.

57
00:20:02,463 --> 00:20:03,438
Yeah, yeah.

58
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:04,824
No, no.

59
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,742
Look at you!

60
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,059
So, how do I look?

61
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:50,662
10 dollars.

62
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:52,081
????????

63
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:53,532
10 dollars.

64
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:55,373
Shepherd, you'll be surprised.

65
00:22:56,152 --> 00:22:57,365
Here is some tobacco for you.

66
00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:00,320
Light your pipe, because
I have something to tell you.

67
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,660
What?

68
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:06,160
I've done a deal.

69
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,503
What have you done?

70
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:09,582
I bought 10 acres of land.

71
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:10,968
Acres?

72
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:12,463
"Acres", it's English.

73
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:13,524
Around 1 hectare in Romanian.

74
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:14,282
1?

75
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:15,279
And a house.

76
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:16,371
And a house?

77
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:18,278
How do you say "casa"
in English?

78
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:23,693
You bought them from a shop.

79
00:23:24,652 --> 00:23:27,468
Where did you find a shop
that sells land and houses?

80
00:23:27,588 --> 00:23:29,309
I found a man who said
that he was moving.

81
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:30,566
He's moving elsewhere.

82
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:34,010
It was like this:
17 dollars for 1 acre,

83
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:34,924
170 for 10.

84
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:37,329
200 dollars for the house and
the outhouses.

85
00:23:37,827 --> 00:23:38,932
2.5 dollars the tobacco,

86
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:40,123
10 dollars the clothes.

87
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:44,260
Well my dear, I think that you gave
the money to that man, and he left.

88
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,051
You think that I'm stupid?

89
00:23:46,484 --> 00:23:48,217
I don't think, I know.

90
00:23:49,408 --> 00:23:50,318
Here is the document.

91
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:53,177
We h-h-had...

92
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,450
witnesses,

93
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,858
and in 10 minutes everything
was done.

94
00:23:56,204 --> 00:23:57,482
That's why I like Americans.

95
00:23:58,219 --> 00:23:58,912
Everything is fast.

96
00:23:59,887 --> 00:24:00,623
Ok.

97
00:24:01,338 --> 00:24:02,486
You bought land.

98
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:05,009
But, where is it?

99
00:24:05,703 --> 00:24:06,807
And, have you seen it?

100
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:10,390
Did you ask the neighbours what
kind of land it is?

101
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,504
How you will work it?

102
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,704
And, who allowed you to buy land?

103
00:24:17,728 --> 00:24:21,037
Is that why we're here?
To buy land?

104
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,202
Or, to earn some money,

105
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,641
to get back home,

106
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:27,044
where our land already is?

107
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:30,365
You deserve a few slaps!

108
00:24:30,712 --> 00:24:32,532
You've gone crazy since 
coming to America.

109
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,195
But it's not a big deal.

110
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:39,461
Let's find that man who sold you the land,
and stole your money.

111
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:40,409
- Come!
- No!

112
00:24:41,557 --> 00:24:42,835
What did you say?

113
00:24:44,264 --> 00:24:44,957
I said no!

114
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:46,334
Please, repeat.

115
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:47,980
No!

116
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,514
We can't leave until
next year.

117
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:52,139
Why, moron?

118
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:56,471
Because...

119
00:24:58,561 --> 00:25:00,879
in 8 months...
I'll be a father.

120
00:25:02,637 --> 00:25:04,067
What are you saying, "Mucho"?

121
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,611
You're no better than him!

122
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:16,286
This is the last shame that could
happen to me.

123
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,738
Come.

124
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:25,826
I knew that you'd be exactly
like your uncle Virgil.

125
00:25:25,946 --> 00:25:28,880
- When he was seeing a female, he also....
- She's not a female!

126
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:30,310
She's my woman!

127
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,629
Well....
shame on you.

128
00:25:38,492 --> 00:25:39,769
Immoral.

129
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:47,474
If Father Iosif finds out?

130
00:25:49,136 --> 00:25:52,450
He must know that I'm
very mad at you.

131
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,956
I should beat you up.

132
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,341
Heeeeeeeeey,
the ones from Poplaca!!!

133
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:08,063
Our family name will
never die!

134
00:26:09,406 --> 00:26:10,294
So what?

135
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:13,056
If I wasn't able...

136
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:15,114
what did you think?

137
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,134
That our name will die?

138
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:20,975
Who? Us?

139
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:22,838
Our family?

140
00:26:25,646 --> 00:26:26,469
Hey girl,

141
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:28,224
I mean woman...

142
00:26:28,592 --> 00:26:29,697
Come here so I can kiss you.

143
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,004
But we...

144
00:26:35,124 --> 00:26:38,281
You, nothing!
You've done your duty.

145
00:26:39,342 --> 00:26:44,086
I'll take care of the rest!

146
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,865
But you know what I'm thinking of?

147
00:26:48,861 --> 00:26:50,269
How should we tell Ion?

148
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:53,626
He gets angry quickly.

149
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:55,424
- What?
- Ion knows.

150
00:26:59,266 --> 00:26:59,829
He knows...

151
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:05,808
Nice.

152
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:09,323
But, it's not too bad.

153
00:27:11,185 --> 00:27:12,311
I realise...

154
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,257
Now is the time to step up.

155
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:19,855
To wash the baby's ass,
and make him toys.

156
00:27:21,588 --> 00:27:22,780
But it's good.

157
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:25,465
It's really good.

158
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,033
- Are you sleeping?
- No.

159
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:36,697
- Is something bothering you?
- Yes.

160
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:38,818
Ion...

161
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,789
This story with the debt...

162
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:42,695
Was it true?

163
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:48,024
How did you earn that money?

164
00:28:50,697 --> 00:28:51,455
You know...

165
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:55,441
Instead of finding the one
from our family who owed you...

166
00:28:55,561 --> 00:28:57,867
you'd better not have got 
it the wrong way!

167
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:58,798
Shut up, please!

168
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:00,346
Sleep!

169
00:29:00,757 --> 00:29:02,274
I won it fair, believe me.

170
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:05,458
What have you done for it?

171
00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:07,234
A lot of things.

172
00:29:12,981 --> 00:29:15,493
Will we reach Poplaca ever?

173
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,634
We will, we will, why not?

174
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:33,165
Well, my brother...

175
00:30:33,484 --> 00:30:36,040
If you bought land, you must work it.

176
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:38,553
Otherwise...,
why would you buy it?

177
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:43,188
But for this, you need tools.

178
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,867
So, you must earn some cash.

179
00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:48,557
To get us on our feet.

180
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:52,169
Check the map for the location 
of the house,

181
00:30:52,754 --> 00:30:55,461
since we haven't even 
seen the place yet.

182
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:58,277
I'm not scared of work.

183
00:30:58,397 --> 00:30:59,951
And you should also not be afraid.

184
00:31:00,406 --> 00:31:01,099
I'll try.

185
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:05,095
Well, goodbye.
See you soon.

186
00:31:05,788 --> 00:31:06,827
Romi, let's go.

187
00:31:07,261 --> 00:31:07,802
Wait.

188
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:11,709
Ioane, maybe you'll find a christian
priest.

189
00:31:15,261 --> 00:31:16,518
Let's go now.

190
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:49,828
Well my dears, we will raise
chickens and turkeys...

191
00:31:50,148 --> 00:31:53,701
Because eggs are very important
for you, girl.

192
00:31:54,307 --> 00:31:57,989
And if Ion earns money,
we will buy a cow too.

193
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:02,111
And we will take the cow to a bull...

194
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:04,255
The first calf we'll keep for ourselves.

195
00:32:05,614 --> 00:32:09,729
We will make provisions,
and when the child grows up a little,

196
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:13,000
We'll go back home.

197
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:15,649
We must face reality.

198
00:32:16,082 --> 00:32:17,230
As long as...

199
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:20,977
the child is little, we can't leave.

200
00:32:23,346 --> 00:32:24,862
Have you thought about his name?

201
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:26,790
And, if it will be a girl?

202
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,389
- Impossible!
- Impossible.

203
00:32:30,228 --> 00:32:32,828
Romi, look on that map.

204
00:32:32,948 --> 00:32:35,860
I don't want to get lost
on someone else's land.

205
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:37,761
Here is it.

206
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:39,061
Seriously?

207
00:33:18,238 --> 00:33:21,255
Romi, my son, it's good.

208
00:33:24,612 --> 00:33:27,780
But I haven't slapped you in a long
time.

209
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,561
Watch out, don't demolish it.

210
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:11,913
Romi, are you remembering the
words from the Bible?

211
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:12,737
Which ones?

212
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,708
What happened on Day 1?

213
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,514
Making food and cleaning.

214
00:35:23,224 --> 00:35:24,331
Goddamnit.

215
00:35:25,047 --> 00:35:26,675
Are you missing my slaps?

216
00:40:40,185 --> 00:40:41,184
What's up with these horses?

217
00:40:43,288 --> 00:40:44,547
They're the horses...

218
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,523
of the one who sold the farm.

219
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:57,867
Water.

220
00:40:57,987 --> 00:41:00,254
- Go to the well.
- Which well?

221
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,735
Congrats Romi.

222
00:41:03,855 --> 00:41:07,489
We have free horses, but what would
they drink?

223
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:10,709
Stop talking.

224
00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:13,444
You'd better fix those harnesses,
we will find something.

225
00:41:14,268 --> 00:41:17,632
Thank you for your advice.

226
00:41:18,764 --> 00:41:20,782
Without it, I would be a dead man.

227
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,712
Where are you Romica?

228
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:27,488
There must be water.

229
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:29,512
There must be water in America.

230
00:42:00,336 --> 00:42:01,855
You left Romi alone.

231
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:21,794
96...

232
00:42:22,554 --> 00:42:23,123
97

233
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:24,696
98

234
00:42:25,537 --> 00:42:26,731
99

235
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:28,141
100.

236
00:42:28,684 --> 00:42:30,094
Here.

237
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:33,576
Hold this.

238
00:42:36,773 --> 00:42:37,485
And you!

239
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,707
Don't be worried about anything.

240
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,446
Because Romi, our little brother,
your husband,

241
00:42:42,915 --> 00:42:44,130
is a trustworthy man.

242
00:42:45,988 --> 00:42:46,786
Well, well.

243
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:55,078
Are you crazy?
Fuck you, idiot!

244
00:42:56,068 --> 00:42:59,210
Stupid motherfucker!

245
00:43:00,027 --> 00:43:02,874
Stupid motherfuckers.

246
00:43:02,994 --> 00:43:04,002
Neighbours?

247
00:43:05,044 --> 00:43:06,988
And they won't let us 
take water from the river.

248
00:43:10,175 --> 00:43:11,026
Romi, we can't go on like this.

249
00:43:12,918 --> 00:43:13,752
No.

250
00:43:14,949 --> 00:43:17,206
I'm going to have a few words with them.

251
00:43:20,478 --> 00:43:22,804
Please teach me the english:

252
00:43:23,499 --> 00:43:26,241
We are your new neighbours,
can we get some water?

253
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:31,274
Ok.

254
00:43:32,467 --> 00:43:33,205
Repeat.

255
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,849
Shut up!
Are you my teacher?

256
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:30,409
I will say to you a few words!

257
00:45:55,546 --> 00:45:57,499
Is anyone home?

258
00:46:21,969 --> 00:46:23,987
Is anyone home?

259
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:26,722
Yes there is.
I am "home".

260
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,122
- Oh, you mother....
- Don't talk like that!

261
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:44,481
[ Hungarian ]

262
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:48,309
I thought you were a thief.

263
00:46:48,982 --> 00:46:52,432
[ hungarian ]

264
00:46:52,757 --> 00:46:53,756
Because he didn't want too.

265
00:46:54,165 --> 00:46:55,294
- Hey!
- What?

266
00:46:59,352 --> 00:47:00,697
You know Romanian.

267
00:47:11,092 --> 00:47:13,696
From hell, not heaven.

268
00:47:19,585 --> 00:47:20,692
Orban Peter.

269
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:24,164
Traian Brad.

270
00:47:24,728 --> 00:47:25,900
Hello.

271
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,005
Hello.

272
00:47:29,956 --> 00:47:31,041
Let me show you...

273
00:47:31,161 --> 00:47:32,777
my house.

274
00:47:37,209 --> 00:47:39,162
I have "tzuica".

275
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:41,332
- Made from plums?
- Yes.

276
00:47:41,452 --> 00:47:43,025
- Not whiskey?
- No.

277
00:47:43,442 --> 00:47:45,135
It's my pleasure then.

278
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,917
Madam, Traian Brad from Poplaca.

279
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:54,499
Emek Forkoszloki.

280
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:58,490
I know every corner of Transylvania.

281
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:04,023
Let's eat some bacon.

282
00:48:12,946 --> 00:48:14,964
It's from plums, I made it myself.

283
00:48:16,678 --> 00:48:18,132
Nice color.

284
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,517
Will there be enough?

285
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:28,313
Nice.

286
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:32,327
It's nice, but this is nicer.

287
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:26,549
You're woried about something.

288
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:28,034
Well Romi...

289
00:59:28,771 --> 00:59:30,507
I will tell you the truth.

290
00:59:31,007 --> 00:59:32,656
It would have been better if we drank the money.

291
01:00:13,501 --> 01:00:14,955
What do they want?

292
01:00:15,389 --> 01:00:17,168
To sell them the farm.

293
01:00:18,437 --> 01:00:20,358
How do you say in english
Go?

294
01:00:25,238 --> 01:00:27,668
I'll shoot you!

295
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:41,808
Well, you can teach me more of these
short words, I like them.

296
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:48,934
You hear?

297
01:00:50,236 --> 01:00:52,971
What do they want from us?

298
01:10:15,731 --> 01:10:18,498
I can't wait to meet Ion.

299
01:10:18,766 --> 01:10:20,474
Maybe you'll be good for him.

300
01:10:21,974 --> 01:10:24,835
And because I like you,
everything is ok.

301
01:10:33,466 --> 01:10:34,577
It's a shame, girl.

302
01:10:35,112 --> 01:10:37,584
You came here, and forgot
your own language.

303
01:10:41,082 --> 01:10:42,429
Hello my dear.

304
01:10:42,914 --> 01:10:45,713
I came here to ask you,

305
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:48,838
our brother Brad Ion,

306
01:10:49,687 --> 01:10:56,034
has he left some money for us,
because we need tools.

307
01:10:56,154 --> 01:10:59,919
But I don't think you understand me,
because you have a weird look.

308
01:11:02,728 --> 01:11:05,310
Yeah, "understand, understand'',
this is all you know.

309
01:11:13,283 --> 01:11:17,275
Ask him: 
What is Ion doing?

310
01:12:02,766 --> 01:12:04,697
Are you a priest?

311
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:05,435
Yes.

312
01:12:05,999 --> 01:12:08,755
I shaved my beard to not be
recognized.

313
01:12:09,081 --> 01:12:10,253
You're talking in Romanian.

314
01:12:10,621 --> 01:12:13,030
I grew up in Braila, ( Romanian region )
of course I know Romanian.

315
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:17,357
Oh shit. Please forgive me, 
but this America....

316
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:18,833
Wait a moment.

317
01:12:19,177 --> 01:12:21,759
God may forgive his sins...

318
01:12:22,562 --> 01:12:25,275
Brother Romi, I found a priest
too.

319
01:12:28,908 --> 01:12:31,946
It's true, he's a little crazy,
but it's good.

320
01:12:32,066 --> 01:12:33,145
He talks Romanian.

321
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:35,315
"ION, YOU MUST COME TO ROMI'S WEDDING,
I'LL BREAK YOUR BONES IF NOT, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

322
01:13:24,762 --> 01:13:26,693
Now, your Holiness,
you may start.

323
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:44,974
Lord have mercy!

324
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:48,359
Have mercy on us,
and us on one another.

325
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:51,875
And all your life, be like this,

326
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:54,522
with your neighbours.

327
01:13:55,043 --> 01:13:58,840
May God....

328
01:13:59,361 --> 01:14:02,356
You must love each other, your home,
and your child.

329
01:14:02,476 --> 01:14:06,344
And you Romulus, it's necessary 
to be faithfull.

330
01:14:06,843 --> 01:14:10,163
Do not fall in temptation!

331
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:22,557
Kiss her!

332
01:14:27,167 --> 01:14:27,774
Like that.

333
01:14:35,007 --> 01:14:38,284
Now, the ceremony must continue.

334
01:14:38,404 --> 01:14:39,824
I don't know how.

335
01:14:40,516 --> 01:14:41,275
What do you mean?

336
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:46,027
I only know the funeral ceremony,
which is not suited for now.

337
01:14:48,281 --> 01:14:52,426
- Father, I realise that you're here for nothing.
- Not necessarily.

338
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:48,672
Miss Orban...

339
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,405
You wanna dance?

340
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:09,016
Why aren't you dancing?

341
01:16:09,371 --> 01:16:10,695
Look at her, 
how beautiful she is.

342
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:40,381
Stop talking about your
prince!

343
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:43,224
You don't want me to start talking about
Iancu ( Transylvania's first and only prince )

344
01:17:43,699 --> 01:17:50,079
Iancu your Highness...

345
01:17:51,161 --> 01:17:54,568
This is how your prince was praying
for mercy.

346
01:18:17,898 --> 01:18:22,607
How can you talk like that about
my prince?

347
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:26,836
But how can you talk like that 
about Iancu?

348
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,246
Like that.

349
01:18:28,854 --> 01:18:30,980
- Like that!
- Me too!

350
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:34,222
Your Iancu is stupid.

351
01:18:42,679 --> 01:18:43,850
I'll kill you!

352
01:19:32,794 --> 01:19:34,530
You're not my friend
anymore!

353
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:36,743
I'm leaving too, shepherd.

354
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:39,629
What?

355
01:19:40,224 --> 01:19:42,980
What a nice wedding this was.

356
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:46,300
Nice, nice.

357
01:19:46,622 --> 01:19:49,877
- Let's drink something.
- Of course.

358
01:20:00,642 --> 01:20:02,768
What is that sound from your coat?

359
01:20:03,202 --> 01:20:05,047
The Bible was lost.

360
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,638
Do you know this game?

361
01:20:08,332 --> 01:20:10,177
I know all games, father.

362
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:18,941
At Braila, if you scored a double
6, you were dead.

363
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:29,716
Look.

364
01:21:26,388 --> 01:21:30,598
Double 6 again?
What did I do wrong, God?

365
01:24:40,614 --> 01:24:41,547
6 6.

366
01:24:42,763 --> 01:24:43,544
4 2.

367
01:24:56,856 --> 01:24:58,831
Why are you awake so early?

368
01:25:00,089 --> 01:25:01,348
Hey "Mucho".

369
01:25:02,173 --> 01:25:05,666
Before opening your mouth,
which talks only nonsense,

370
01:25:06,395 --> 01:25:09,010
take care of your own sleep, not mine.

371
01:25:09,661 --> 01:25:10,702
What are you doing here?

372
01:25:12,026 --> 01:25:13,393
I'm digging.

373
01:25:13,834 --> 01:25:15,701
I see, but what are you digging?

374
01:25:16,721 --> 01:25:17,740
A well.

375
01:25:18,649 --> 01:25:21,014
I don't want to go again
to that Hungarian.

376
01:25:21,134 --> 01:25:24,508
If there was water, don't you think 
that those before us would have dug one?

377
01:25:26,482 --> 01:25:28,349
They were lazy.

378
01:25:32,706 --> 01:25:35,266
I'll have my water,
our water.

379
01:25:55,308 --> 01:25:56,371
It's impossible.

380
01:25:56,675 --> 01:26:00,386
That's not logical.

381
01:26:00,807 --> 01:26:01,545
What?

382
01:26:01,913 --> 01:26:04,691
That your brother scores
what he wants.

383
01:26:05,516 --> 01:26:08,055
That makes no sense.

384
01:26:08,175 --> 01:26:12,425
What he does, is called
sorcery.

385
01:26:14,465 --> 01:26:15,029
Look.

386
01:26:17,178 --> 01:26:17,959
Again.

387
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:19,885
6 6.

388
01:26:24,225 --> 01:26:25,288
You see what I see?

389
01:26:25,408 --> 01:26:26,568
I see.

390
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:03,936
A very good time is prepared
for Mr. Berkovich.

391
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:08,447
- Who is this man?
- This is the one who makes coffins.

392
01:27:08,946 --> 01:27:12,353
He builds coffins.

393
01:27:12,676 --> 01:27:16,951
When a man dies, he "sleeps"
in a coffin of his size.

394
01:27:20,746 --> 01:27:23,632
I'll explain.
I'll build 2 for you.

395
01:27:39,392 --> 01:27:40,173
Do you like it?

396
01:27:41,843 --> 01:27:44,490
- Isn't it too big?
- No, maybe we'll have twins.

397
01:28:15,358 --> 01:28:16,096
Shepherd!

398
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:20,740
Shepherd!

399
01:28:22,803 --> 01:28:25,776
- Who came?
- Orban's boys, they brought water.

400
01:28:27,186 --> 01:28:28,163
Water?

401
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:34,998
Charity?

402
01:28:36,169 --> 01:28:36,907
For us?

403
01:28:38,339 --> 01:28:40,965
- We need water.
- Shut up!

404
01:28:48,330 --> 01:28:50,457
I don't need your water!

405
01:28:50,772 --> 01:28:52,247
Look what I'm doing with it.

406
01:28:55,242 --> 01:28:57,434
You're cra...

407
01:28:57,554 --> 01:28:59,647
How dare you talk like this,
"Mucho"?

408
01:28:59,981 --> 01:29:03,149
You want a few slaps!

409
01:29:04,538 --> 01:29:05,949
And you, what are you doing?

410
01:29:06,448 --> 01:29:08,314
Let it flow!

411
01:29:15,848 --> 01:29:19,385
Please forgive me, 
I didn't want to hurt you.

412
01:29:19,819 --> 01:29:20,600
Put her there.

413
01:29:20,991 --> 01:29:21,924
There.

414
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:28,713
Remember.

415
01:29:29,017 --> 01:29:31,296
And tell it to the kid
if I'm dead.

416
01:29:31,793 --> 01:29:34,332
We do not accept charity.

417
01:29:35,547 --> 01:29:36,372
Do you understand?

418
01:29:38,802 --> 01:29:39,670
Ok then.

419
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:46,439
Romi,
where is thatsmell coming from?

420
01:29:48,218 --> 01:29:49,889
Maybe there was a toilet there 
before.

421
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:52,862
You're crazy.

422
01:29:54,775 --> 01:29:57,032
After so much work,
you find a toilet?

423
01:30:12,748 --> 01:30:15,840
Romi, what toilet was here?

424
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:46,769
Ion, I'm glad that I found you.
We have a big problem!

425
01:30:47,095 --> 01:30:48,288
It's not about Julie.

426
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:50,662
- It's burning!
- They set you on fire?

427
01:30:50,782 --> 01:30:54,177
- The ground is burning.
- Are you stupid?

428
01:30:54,297 --> 01:30:57,107
You want some slaps.
Are you deaf? The ground is burning.

429
01:30:57,227 --> 01:30:59,459
I dug a well and that's what I found.

430
01:31:01,846 --> 01:31:03,148
Fucking oil!

431
01:31:03,756 --> 01:31:07,033
If it's a treasure?

432
01:31:07,153 --> 01:31:08,806
Uncle Nicolae said this:

433
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,155
When it's a treasure
it erupts.

434
01:31:13,116 --> 01:31:14,106
Hello, father.

435
01:31:14,536 --> 01:31:16,637
- When are we playing again?
- I'm not playing with you anymore.

436
01:31:16,757 --> 01:31:18,251
- Why?
- Because you're lucky.

437
01:31:31,884 --> 01:31:32,909
Ion!

438
01:31:33,464 --> 01:31:36,103
Explain this to me!

439
01:31:49,602 --> 01:31:50,140
Ion...

440
01:31:51,112 --> 01:31:54,931
Since I'm here with you,
please translate your words.

441
01:31:55,621 --> 01:31:56,288
I was saying...

442
01:31:58,468 --> 01:31:59,940
I was saying that Orban should
be our leader.

443
01:32:00,961 --> 01:32:01,672
What?

444
01:32:02,193 --> 01:32:03,269
Orban to be the leader?

445
01:32:03,669 --> 01:32:05,544
How is that possible?
Leave me alone!

446
01:32:06,044 --> 01:32:06,946
Come down.

447
01:32:07,953 --> 01:32:10,002
- Traian!
- No Traian, this man leader,

448
01:32:11,339 --> 01:32:12,311
NEVER!

449
01:32:13,392 --> 01:32:18,218
He, the one who insulted Iancu?

450
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:19,624
Leave me alone!

451
01:32:21,483 --> 01:32:22,698
You, to command me?

452
01:32:23,063 --> 01:32:23,983
Traian Brad?

453
01:32:24,729 --> 01:32:25,719
NEVER!

454
01:32:26,066 --> 01:32:27,038
As long as I live.

455
01:32:31,132 --> 01:32:32,660
- What does he want?
- What does he say?

456
01:32:33,525 --> 01:32:35,574
I'm saying nothing,
it's your business.

457
01:32:36,129 --> 01:32:39,220
An Orban shall never command me!

458
01:32:40,258 --> 01:32:41,907
Ion, you should be ashamed.

459
01:32:43,956 --> 01:32:45,396
What is that word?

460
01:32:46,929 --> 01:32:48,249
We go!

461
01:32:48,369 --> 01:32:48,769
Come.

462
01:34:04,628 --> 01:34:06,329
- It will be a solution?
- What solution?

463
01:34:07,318 --> 01:34:09,349
Let's go and talk with McKellan...

464
01:34:10,193 --> 01:34:14,324
You do the talking, and I'll 
make a nice ceremony.

465
01:38:40,313 --> 01:38:44,445
Come, the circus has began.
You're not some ladies in front of a mirror.

466
01:38:44,844 --> 01:38:48,003
McKellan has gone to kill Orban.
Come!

467
01:39:40,946 --> 01:39:42,265
You're here my dear
Transylvanians.

468
01:39:43,342 --> 01:39:44,487
Hello Peter.

469
01:39:45,112 --> 01:39:46,727
How could I leave you
like this?

470
01:39:52,924 --> 01:39:54,695
Ion, go there.

471
01:39:55,602 --> 01:39:57,113
Romi, there.

472
01:39:57,460 --> 01:39:59,126
Peter, come here.

473
01:40:43,347 --> 01:40:44,319
Take care.

474
01:40:48,711 --> 01:40:50,326
You've messed with the wrong people.

475
01:41:12,956 --> 01:41:19,780
- Where did you get that?
- From Plevna, year 1877.

476
01:41:24,324 --> 01:41:28,230
- What is wrong with these guys,
they only want my head. - Cover me!

477
01:41:29,945 --> 01:41:31,854
Ion, be careful!

478
01:41:55,521 --> 01:42:01,120
If that Turk ever found out
what his weapon is doing here...

479
01:42:12,748 --> 01:42:14,983
God's yard must be huge.

480
01:43:57,346 --> 01:44:00,710
Romi....
I think we're done.

481
01:44:03,075 --> 01:44:03,856
Let's go.

482
01:44:41,244 --> 01:44:42,221
Put your finger.

483
01:44:53,365 --> 01:44:54,363
Did you understand?

484
01:45:25,163 --> 01:45:29,503
Well, only God can illuminate that man.

485
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:31,912
He's a stubborn Transylvanian,
like me.

486
01:45:32,996 --> 01:45:33,972
Goodbye.

487
01:46:32,911 --> 01:46:33,562
It's a boy.

488
01:46:34,026 --> 01:46:37,238
- He looks like me.
- Like me too.

489
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:39,560
- And me too.
- He looks like us.

490
01:46:49,584 --> 01:46:50,842
Thank you my dear.

491
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:57,788
Scream my boy, scream.

492
01:46:58,721 --> 01:47:00,501
So it can be heard in Poplaca.

493
