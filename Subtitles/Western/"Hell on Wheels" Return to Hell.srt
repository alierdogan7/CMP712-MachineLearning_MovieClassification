00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:27,297
Shut up, Paddy.

185
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:29,049
You can write her yourself tomorrow.

186
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,550
I can't read, sir.

187
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:31,802
Can't help you there.

188
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:33,103
Watch it!

189
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:36,106
[Screams]

190
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:43,814
[Both coughing]

191
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:46,366
- Get it out!
- Water!

192
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:49,403
Keep 'em coming.

193
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,738
Pass the bucket. Come on.

194
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,991
Quickly lads!

195
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:56,827
Come on, get this fire out!

196
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,880
Keep 'em coming!

197
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:02,165
Come on, faster, faster.
Come on, move it out.

198
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:03,467
All right, boys, pick it up!

199
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:53,860
It's always good doin' business 
with a fellow pioneer, Mr. Young.

200
00:15:53,941 --> 00:15:57,483
Please, thank all of your wives
for the heartiest hospitality

201
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:59,592
I have felt on either
side of the Mississippi.

202
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:01,785
We'll make a Saint of you yet,
Mr. Huntington.

203
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,870
I will pray for your safe
return to Sacramento.

204
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:08,154
And I will hope for your continued
health and prosperity.

205
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,660
Oh, uh... mister, uh...

206
00:16:10,713 --> 00:16:12,796
Gundersen, was it?

207
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:16,216
That name is Norwegian if I'm not mistaken.

208
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:19,002
You are not mistaken.

209
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:23,807
Why did you want to know what
kind of feed I give my chinamen?

210
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:32,766
Our guest asked you a question,
brother Gundersen.

211
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:36,019
I learned during the war

212
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:39,072
that an army runs on its stomach,

213
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:44,327
and what is a labor force
if not a small army?

214
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:46,747
I see.

215
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:47,925
Thank you.

216
00:16:47,951 --> 00:16:50,617
I spent years on the Union Pacific Railroad

217
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:51,701
under Thomas Durant.

218
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:53,703
Oh, that old son of a gun?

219
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:55,872
He ever give you that damn speech of his

220
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:58,041
- about the lion and the zebra?
- Oh, many times, yes.

221
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:00,177
Oh! 'Bout turned me into rip van winkle.

222
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:02,629
Because you found it boring?

223
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:04,097
[Laughs]

224
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:06,133
Tell me, did you ever have the opportunity

225
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:07,517
to work with Cullen Bohannon?

226
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,894
That man impresses the hell out of me.

227
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:12,439
Everything I know,

228
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:17,027
I learned by careful
study of Cullen Bohannon.

229
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:18,862
How about that?

230
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:21,364
And I suppose I'll see him
on the downslope soon enough.

231
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,317
Perhaps you could use a
former Union Pacific man

232
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:30,157
to accompany your fresh mormon workers.

233
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:31,491
That is,

234
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:36,546
if brother Brigham can spare me.

235
00:17:36,582 --> 00:17:37,881
We will discuss it.

236
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,299
Hmm.

237
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:41,384
Leave us, Gundersen.

238
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,636
Good day.

239
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:04,107
You. Remember me?

240
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,360
You no good trash.

241
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:13,116
Help... me...

242
00:18:13,168 --> 00:18:17,037
Look at me.

243
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:19,873
Look at me!

244
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,925
My name is Eva.

245
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,546
I'm a mother, daughter, injun,

246
00:18:26,598 --> 00:18:28,798
wife, and whore.

247
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:30,433
But all my time on this earth,

248
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:35,272
I ain't ever met a bigger
piece of shit than you.

249
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:10,090
He couldn't be saved.

250
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:14,728
Have you seen Ezra?

251
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:17,147
I-I'm sorry, I haven't.

252
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:21,568
Ezra hasn't come back.

253
00:19:21,603 --> 00:19:23,853
I'll be over after a while.

254
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:26,856
He's never stayed out all night.

255
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:28,608
All right. Hey, listen.

256
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,361
H... h...
he run off before all this started.

257
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:34,080
- He's all right. 
- But... but where is he?

258
00:19:34,116 --> 00:19:35,198
Probably just tryin' to stay out of the way.

259
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,366
We'll find him.

260
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:38,335
- Ezra! 
- Ezra!

261
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,869
- Come on out, now!
- Ezra!

262
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:42,872
Have you not seen him, Ruth?

263
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:44,374
Oh, you know how boys are.

264
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:45,747
- He's just hidin' somewheres.
- Ezra!

265
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:47,556
Ezra!

266
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:50,180
- I won't be cross! 
- Ezra!

267
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:56,052
Please! Come out!

268
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:59,522
What is it?

269
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:02,201
The back room.

270
00:20:02,227 --> 00:20:04,644
No, church was clear.

271
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:09,232
Under the floor.

272
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,438
Ruth...

273
00:21:21,473 --> 00:21:24,474
No.

274
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:25,775
Please.

275
00:21:25,811 --> 00:21:28,361
- No!
- No, no.

276
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:29,779
No! Let me... let me go!

277
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:32,315
[Screams]

278
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:39,743
[Sobbing and wailing]

279
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,681
Sidney Snow. Where is he?

280
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:20,017
I don't know.

281
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:21,018
He's your marshal.

282
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,571
[Grunts]

283
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:25,489
I haven't had eyes on him

284
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:27,074
since he left on that prison train!

285
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,026
He takes his orders from you.

286
00:22:29,078 --> 00:22:31,946
Hey, that man's incapable of takin'
orders from anyone.

287
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:33,864
Whoa! A child is dead!

288
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,083
I swear to you before God.

289
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:39,036
I had nothin' to do with the
heinous crimes at the church.

290
00:22:39,088 --> 00:22:42,373
You hired that son of bitch
when you should have hung him.

291
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:44,291
You're right.

292
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:46,093
You're right.

293
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:50,297
The blame for last night's tragedy is mine.

294
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:55,136
I never should have empowered Sidney Snow.

295
00:22:55,188 --> 00:22:57,972
I've killed far better men than you

296
00:22:58,024 --> 00:23:01,692
for doin' a lot less than that.

297
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:05,312
I have no shred of doubt.

298
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:11,952
I'd like to offer every
resource at my disposal

299
00:23:11,988 --> 00:23:16,791
to help you find him and see him hang.

300
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:28,419
You're all out of resources,
far as I can tell.

301
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:34,225
Campbell didn't know.

302
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,395
We searched the casino,
the whorehouse, the laundry.

303
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,397
Every bleedin' rat hole in Cheyenne.

304
00:23:39,432 --> 00:23:41,432
- Search again.
- I've searched it already!

305
00:23:41,484 --> 00:23:43,067
He's got to be somewheres.

306
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:46,437
I oversaw the search myself.

307
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:48,439
Bohannon.

308
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:51,609
- You seen him?
- Mm-mm.

309
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:55,112
There are a lot of rotten,
mangy dogs in this town,

310
00:23:55,164 --> 00:23:57,665
but none who'd shelter a child-killer.

311
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:01,786
All he had to was hop on a horse.

312
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:03,871
He's halfway to Mexico by now,

313
00:24:03,923 --> 00:24:06,424
or some other arsehole town in this world!

314
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:08,793
He ain't in Mexico.

315
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:10,044
Cullen!

316
00:24:15,218 --> 00:24:16,383
He's gone.

317
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:22,306
It's over.

318
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:35,870
I had him, Mickey.

319
00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:46,275
In the general store.

320
00:24:49,744 --> 00:24:53,796
Had my gun to his head.

321
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,257
Well, why didn't you shoot him?

322
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:20,742
Ruth...

323
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:28,289
We searched everywheres...

324
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:30,591
And I was too slow.

325
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:32,638
Stupid.

326
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:39,600
I let Sidney get away.

327
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:48,309
When you first brought him to the church,

328
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:53,030
I wanted to send him to the orphanage.

329
00:25:53,065 --> 00:25:56,650
I had no business being anyone's mother.

330
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,334
You was just scared.

331
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:19,590
I never learned his full name.

332
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:23,260
Never knew where he came from.

333
00:26:26,182 --> 00:26:28,599
Whether he had brothers or sisters

334
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:32,519
or what became of his family.

335
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:36,991
I don't know if he was a
colicky baby or a happy one

336
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:42,746
or if his eyes were like his father's.

337
00:26:42,782 --> 00:26:47,418
He'll never go to school.

338
00:26:47,453 --> 00:26:49,837
Never have a sweetheart.

339
00:26:54,627 --> 00:26:59,797
Never get married.

340
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:02,716
He hated doing chores.

341
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:07,554
He brought live toads into the church.

342
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:23,320
He was wild and headstrong...

343
00:27:23,372 --> 00:27:27,541
And I could never get him to take a bath.

344
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:29,994
But he was a good boy.

345
00:27:36,252 --> 00:27:39,887
And the last time I saw him,

346
00:27:39,922 --> 00:27:42,673
I spoke to him in anger.

347
00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:46,343
No. No.

348
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:47,511
You was just tryin' to protect him.

349
00:27:47,563 --> 00:27:49,897
The good it did.

350
00:27:49,932 --> 00:27:52,996
- You didn't know.
- I should've known!

351
00:27:56,405 --> 00:28:00,357
I was supposed to take care of him.

352
00:28:04,664 --> 00:28:08,248
I never deserved to be a mother.

353
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:09,389
[Sobs]

354
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,658
[Sobbing]

355
00:28:36,205 --> 00:28:37,861
Ah, brother Brigham.

356
00:28:39,087 --> 00:28:41,304
Good day.

357
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:45,725
You made a favorable impression
on Collis Huntington.

358
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:49,479
We discussed your

359
00:28:49,514 --> 00:28:53,015
accompanying the saints to
work on the Central Pacific.

360
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:56,235
He'd like you along.

361
00:28:56,271 --> 00:29:01,023
Truly a man of vision, like yourself.

362
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:06,746
The holy spirit compelled me to...
to reach out to him.

363
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:07,997
Oh!

364
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:18,374
