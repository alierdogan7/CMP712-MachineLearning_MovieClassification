1
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,934
Tall and skinny, mean tempered
and extra fast with gun

2
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,217
Travels with half-wit uncle
called Uncle Roscoe something

3
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,452
# Round and round we're goin'

4
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,853
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
And bye-bye, Lucy Long

5
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,488
# Old Joe Clarke, he had a wife

6
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,220
# She was seven feet tall

7
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,091
# She slept with her head in the kitchen
And her big feet in the hall

8
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,490
# I wished I had a sweetheart

9
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,220
# I'd put her on the shelf

10
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,454
# And every time she'd grin at me
I'd get up there myself

11
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,973
# Round and round #

12
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,849
Melody, how many verses
you say there was to that song?

13
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,215
About 100, I reckon

14
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,931
- 100
- But I only know about 90 of 'em

15
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,898
# Bye-bye, Lucy Long

16
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,176
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke

17
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,854
# Round and round we're goin' #

18
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,170
Melody, what is it?

19
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,856
Some cow town, it looks like

20
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,979
How come here?
I thought there wasn't any till Hot Creek

21
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,779
- I don't know, unless
- Unless what?

22
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,570
George, you recollect that fork in the road
500 miles back, we turned right?

23
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,379
I just remembered we should have turned left

24
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,011
It don't surprise me none
A cowhand that goes in for breaking horses,

25
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,809
he's been hit
in the seat of the pants so many times,

26
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,053
he ain't got any brains any more,
just oatmeal in his head

27
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,979
# I wished I was a big, red apple

28
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,700
# Hanging on a tree

29
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,533
# And every pretty girl that come along

30
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,168
# Would take a bite out of me

31
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,059
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke

32
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,609
# Round and round we're goin'

33
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,340
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke

34
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,650
# Bye-bye, Lucy Long #

35
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,610
- Howdy, friend
- Howdy

36
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,897
- Where are we, old-timer?
- This here's Payneville

37
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,016
Painful? What's painful?

38
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,696
- This here is
- You mean generally or is this personal?

39
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:17,370
It's a bad sign when the first fella you meet
in a town is some kind of hobgoblin

40
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:39,699
Don't go far I don't aim to be drinking
for more than five or six hours

41
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,135
- Is that him?
- Yes, I think so

42
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,298
<i>(softly)</i> # Round and round, Old Joe Clarke

43
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,179

# Bye-bye, Lucy Long #

46
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,297
I guess she's got as much right
to get thirsty as a man

47
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,416
<i>(hums)</i>

48
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,859
- Look She's coming out
- Just look at that walk

49
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,976
Very nice

50
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,376
Very nice

51
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,614
- No, Ira Don't
- Let go of me

52
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,736
No, look!

53
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,930
I didn't mean nothin'

54
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,290
I didn't know

55
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,978
All right From now on, don't go
making remarks about other men's girls

56
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,096
Yes, sir

57
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,780
No, no, sir No

58
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,249
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing, <i>señor</i>

59
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,775
You want something maybe, please?

60
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,496
Give me some of them

61
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,496
<i>¿Tomates?</i>

62
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,133
- Open 'em I'll eat 'em here
- <i>Sí, señor</i>

63
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,979
Again

64
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,774
Don't try to draw with him
If you do, you're dead

65
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,412
- Did he see me?
- No

66
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,536
I thought he did

67
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,578
He'll cross back over to get his horse

68
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,337
We pushed a thousand head of cattle out there,
me and my partner, him and me

69
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,176
What's more, you fuzzy-faced apes, my name
ain't Roscoe and I ain't nobody's uncle

70
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,891
The next one that calls me so
will get down on the floor

71
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,536
Don't look for me back, either

72
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,978
I will invest my money
where at least one man ain't a lunatic

73
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,212
- Drunk already?
- Let's get outta this place

74
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,135
It's a spook town
The more I see, the more I don't like it

75
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,134
- They do something?
- No, outside of calling me their uncle

76
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,738
It's their attitude They're disrespectful

77
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,893
George, you take gettin' used to
You don't make the right impression

78
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,450
- You ought to know that by now
- Ought I?

79
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,853
You walk in someplace where nobody don't
know you, you already got that dumb look

80
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,889
You ask some fool question any papoose
could answer, like, "Where am I?"

81
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,130
You ain't immediately nominated for governor

82
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,215
You gotta walk in kinda unsmiling

83
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,052
Unsmiling?

84
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,977
Look and act like you're somebody, like you can
take care of yourself no matter what happens

85
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,213
- Pretty soon you are somebody
- That what you done?

86
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,171
I ain't said more than two words in this town
and already I got a certain standing

87
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,059
Unsmiling, eh?

88
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:31,171
I can walk in any place and clear my own place
at the bar until they even before they know me

89
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,330
- All right Come with me
- Huh?

90
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,976
Come with me

91
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,494
Mr Unsmiling Jones

92
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,333
Thought you said you weren't coming back

93
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,094
<i>(laughter)</i>

94
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,776
<i>(men fall silent)</i>

95
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,735
- Your pleasure, gentlemen?
- Some liquor

96
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,856
Yes, sir

97
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,130
Stop goggling You're with me

98
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,779
- Mud in your eye
- Thank you, sir Thank you very much

99
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,574
- Good stuff
- Yeah

100
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,618
- I make it myself
- How much?

101
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,736
On the house, any time

102
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,856
Much obliged

103
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,456
You see?

104
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,898
It's spooked
The whole dad-blamed town is spooked

105
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,498
We gotta get outta this place quick

106
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,015
Why, it's all very simple, George

107
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,618
Simple? What would you have done
if somebody had drawn on you?

108
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,135
What would anyone draw on me for?

109
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,170
Because you was asking for it The way
you walked in, your face all scrounged up

110
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,889
It was just asking somebody
to slap leather with you

111
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,812
Well

112
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,737
Look, Melody, you couldn't hit the hind end
of your horse with a handful of bug shot

113
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,856
- Right in front
- He'll move

114
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,774
You ain't a gun fighter
You ain't even a good shot

115
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,775
You're just a no-good bronc stomper
that's been hit in the seat of the pants

116
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,168
eoeok

117
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,493
He's looking at something else

118
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,810
Darlin'!

119
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,936
Monte!

120
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,650
<i>(whihspers)</i> Don't move There's a gun on you

121
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,380
- Come with me Keep close
- Listen, lady

122
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,295
Do as I tell you
and I'll get you out of this Smile Smile

123
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,859
That's better

124
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,217
Stay right here and I'll get your horses

125
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,133
- <i>(George)</i> Who is it?
- I never seen her before

126
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,336
In Cherryenne when you was
kicked in the head and missing four days,

127
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,809
you sure you didn't marry somebody?

128
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,575
I wasn't that far out of my head

129
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,415
Whoa

130
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,140
- Keep close to the front wheel
- But

131
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,291
- You looking to get shot?
- No

132
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,497
Then do what I say
When you start moving, move

133
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,412
Now can you tell us what happened?

134
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,653
- What's them initials stand for?
- That's for my name, Melody Jones

135
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,572
For Monte Jarrad too

136
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,860
You don't look much like him, really
Excepting you're built something like him

137
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,138
- Tall and spindly
- They took me for somebody else?

138
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,250
That's why I did what I did,
so's you wouldn't get killed by mistake

139
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,533
Oh

140
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,899
- Then it wasn't me they were scared of?
- They thought you was Monte Jarrad

141
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,055
You say somebody is fixing
to kill this here Monte Jarrad?

142
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,169
- Nobody but the sheriff and his posse
- Any particular reason outside of prejudice?

143
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,900
Well, there's always the reward, of course

144
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,736
1000 dollars, dead or alive

145
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,778
Mr Unsmiling Jones,

146
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,091
a man with a certain standing in the community

147
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,136
<i>(dog barking)</i>

148
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,689
Whoa

149
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,136
- Is this Monte?
- No, they just took him for Monte

150
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,088
Of course it's Monte
Hi, Monte Heard a lot about you

151
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,299
Don't pay no attention to Pop
He's a little mixed up

152
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,894
This is Uncle Roscoe, ain't it?

153
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,494
Hi, Uncle Roscoe

154
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,051
I'd ask you to alight and eat, but I think
you'd better keep going, south

155
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,609
I ain't in any hurry

156
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,375
Can't you understand?
There's gonna be a posse after you

157
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,134
Not after me I ain't done nothin'

158
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,929
- Ain't you gonna alight?
- No, he's gonna keep going

159
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,568
You can't be as thick-headed as that

160
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,018
This country's full of men
just aiming to shoot you on sight

161
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,651
- Get outta here while you still can
- You heard what she said

162
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,136
- Get going
- Who are you?

163
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,256
He's my brother Avery

164
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,329
Now, are you going?

165
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,456
All right

166
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,412
Come on Uncle Roscoe

167
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,535
Cherry

168
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,936
Cherry

169
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,736
Let me in, Cherry

170
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,696
That's just the way it was

171
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,535
One punch and Ira Waggoner
was flat in the road

172
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,650
Wish he'd broken his neck That's what I get
for tyin' up with somebody I ain't never seen

173
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,132
- You don't even know Waggoner?
- I never saw him Leo picked him

174
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,249
It was fixed that the shotgun guy that got me
was gonna be left behind

175
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,617
Outside the horse,
there wasn't supposed to be no shootin'

176
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,614
- I got a good mind to blast his belly open
- That's right

177
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,418
- Get outta here!
- I was

178
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:18,496
Never mind Get to town and look for Leo,
so I don't have to slope outta here by myself

179
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,616
Sure, Monte

180
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,456
You stay here

181
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,419
Now, what about this fella?

182
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,938
- He's nothing but a tramp cowhand
- Stop talking like a fool or like I'm a fool

183
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,730
How do you know
he ain't one of Luke Packard's men?

184
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,856
Come on, Monte Sit down

185
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,057
There Now, he's nothing but a tramp cowhand

186
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,610
who just wandered into Payneville
with an old side rider

187
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,058
On account of the initials on his saddle,
they took him for you

188
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,690
Cotton was fixing to shoot him
when I got this idea

189
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,571
I figured the best thing I could do was
help them keep on thinking he was you

190
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,653
Tomorrow, the posse'll be ridin' after him
50 miles from here,

191
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,573
and the north'll be wide open for you

192
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,732
- See anything wrong about that?
- Yeah

193
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,017
Nobody's as stupid as you make him out to be

194
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,013
He's just a common, ordinary,
useless bronc stomper,

195
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,252
like you see any way you looked around here

196
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,093
He'd have done anything I asked him to

197
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,538
He would, huh?

198
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,135
He did, didn't he?

199
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,374
He kinda liked you?

200
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,895
Yeah, it looked like it

201
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,936
That's what I thought it was

202
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,135
You better be glad he did, too

203
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,979
There's something maybe you better remember

204
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,577
And never mind tellin' me
how it didn't mean nothin' to you

205
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,937
Just don't monkey around with nobody at all,

206
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,739
unless you wanna see their belly blasted open

207
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:32,133
In my life, I ain't never been so low in my mind
as since I talked to that there girl

208
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,693
If we aim to get across that line,
we ought to hustle up these ponies

209
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,819
- I don't aim to cross any line
- What are you talking about?

210
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,259
I don't aim to get across any line
because that's what she wants us to do

211
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,139
I worked that out before her mouth shut

212
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,328
- You mean there ain't no posse?
- Sure, and it's probably trailin' us

213
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,572
There wouldn't be if she hadn't sicked it on us

214
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,369
Are you telling me
that there pretty lady is a skunk?

215
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,737
Something happened back there
we don't know what it is

216
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,256
If that posse's trailing us to the south,

217
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,379
it'd make an opening
for somebody to get away to the north

218
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,011
- I can't believe it
- Where is that somebody else now?

219
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,810
If what you say is a fact,
he's hid out round that same place

220
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,656
- That's the way I figured it too
- Leastways, if she ain't, he

221
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,293
Wait a minute, Melody
You ain't gotta be no dumber than necessary

222
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,294
That would make me somebody
The man that took Monte Jarrad

223
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,099
- Now, you look here
- You don't understand, George

224
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,493
But for one hour back there
I felt what it felt like to be high-regarded

225
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,256
- I'm never gonna feel the same again
- But that fella's a killer

226
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,618
I might even get
you can't tell get to be sheriff

227
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,012
<i>(gunshot)</i>

228
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,297
That or a corpse One or the other

229
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,936
Now, you just listen to me

230
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,180
- Where are you goin'?
- Back

231
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,695
But listen, Melody Melody!

232
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,215
You go on if you want to

233
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,613
If only you could shoot a little better

234
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,056
<i>(howling)</i>

235
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,171
What are we supposed to be doing?
Playing Indians?

236
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,689
You gonna ask her where he is?

237
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,011
I ain't figured out yet what I'm gonna do

238
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:07,051
I was mixed up in shootin' once I can't tell you
how quick I got sick of the whole idea

239
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,696
Mm-hm!

240
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,090
- He's changed, Avery
- He can't help it He's in trouble

241
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,615
They're chasin' him and he's wounded

242
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,616
No, it's more than that

243
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,978
You know, when we were all kids together,
just growin' up,

244
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,291
he was kind of wild, of course

245
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,009
That's why I was so crazy about him, I guess

246
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,409
But it ain't wildness now He's mean

247
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,654
Plain, downright mean
And he's gettin' meaner all the time

248
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,936
There she is now Ask her

249
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,818
What you got in this mattress? Skulls?

250
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,416
Take your dirty feet off my bed

251
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,413
You've really got a crust

252
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,935
- My horse run off and I
- Shh!

253
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,850
Look, I don't know if you're crazy,
but you've gotta get out of here

254
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,093
- I'll get you another horse and saddle
- I couldn't leave without Henry

255
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,218
- Your partner?
- No, Henry's my horse

256
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,850
I couldn't leave him, specially with his bridle on

257
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,734
- Where is your partner?
- George?

258
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,176
He's out somewhere in the brush

259
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,296
He's the nervous type

260
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,416
Oh

261
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,818
In some kind of a fix, ain't you?

262
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:40,295
Of course not All I'm trying to do
is to keep you out of a fix

263
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,414
Don't you see?
That's why I took you out of town

264
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,734
You mean when you called me Monte
in the middle of the street?

265
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,178
You've got it crazy about this Monte, ain't you?

266
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,771
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll make a deal with you

267
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,898
<i>(dog barks and growls)</i>

268
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,374
- What'd you do that for?
- Your dog's seen something

269
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,293
Somebody's prowling around out there

270
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,816
Your partner, maybe

271
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,540
No, he'd fall over something

272
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,020
Sounds like he's gone now

273
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,216
What kind of a deal?

274
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,133
Will you do somethin' for me?

275
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,179
Sure

276
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,298
- Stay in this room until morning?
- Do what?

277
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,849
Sleep here, in that bed?

278
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,976
For me? Will you?

279
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,015
- Why?
- I'll explain it in the morning

280
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,331
I just don't want you goin' outta here tonight

281
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,054
- All right
- You promise?

282
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,176
Sure

283
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,016
Thank you

284
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,898
- And for Pete's sake, stay put this time, will you?
- Mm

285
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,018
- Thanks Good night
- Uh

286
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,009
You don't wanna sit and talk a spell first?

287
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,136
Heaven forbid

288
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,615
- Stick 'em up
- You surely took long enough about it

289
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:03,535
- You heard me?
- I been listenin' to you for about five minutes

290
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,132
You always wanna shoot 'em in the right eye
Spoils their aim

291
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,460
I went back into town last night

292
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,576
To look into things

293
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,336
What'd you find out?

294
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:25,336
The way it looks now, as long as you keep on
lettin' anybody think you're Monte Jarrad,

295
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,651
you've got five chances of being hung or shot,

296
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,574
which a fella tells me is a record in these parts

297
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,492
How come?

298
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:39,131
One the sheriff's got just about
everybody in this county in a posse

299
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,613
that ain't got no other aim in life
but to catch you and hang you

300
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,571
Two there's a family
in this county named Cotton

301
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,016
that you killed three members of
five years ago

302
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,253
This family, which has got
about 150 uncles and cousins,

303
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,493
is conducting an independent hunt
to kill you ahead of the posse

304
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,974
Three?

305
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:10,409
Three if neither one of them crowds get you,
the express company has got its men here

306
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,016
because 40,000 dollars in cash
was taken off that stage.

307
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,139
Some say 40 million,
but that sounds like an overstatement to me

308
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,337
Four failing all them people gettin' you,

309
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,890
you can look for
the United States Cavalry to arrive

310
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,415
There was some mail on that stage

311
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,290
They aim to kill you both 'cause you is
Monte Jarrad and 'cause you ain't Monte Jarrad,

312
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,179
and they just don't like to be disappointed

313
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,693
You said five

314
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:42,537
And five if you keep on looking at
a certain female lady the way you've been,

315
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:48,650
I think we could count on Monte Jarrad himself
to take a hand in the shooting soon

316
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:58,255
If this Monte Jarrad is such a well-known,
popular sort of a jigger,

317
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:03,016
- how come I get mistook for him?
- Monte ain't been back for five years

318
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,490
Besides, you ain't run into nobody
that knowed him good

319
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,970
You ain't fooled nobody
that really knowed Monte

320
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,133
- I got a message for you
- I don't know nobody in Payneville

321
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,612
It was hardly a social introduction,
but you did knock him over

322
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,490
Name's Ira Waggoner
He drove the stage that Monte held up

323
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,415
- How'd he know about me?
- He don't

324
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,970
"Give this to Monte," he said
Everybody thinks you're him

325
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,416
Everybody but this little lady skunk
you're taking up with

326
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,059
<i>(Cherry)</i> Skunk, huh?

327
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,576
Mornin'

328
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:49,453
Cherry George didn't mean that
He was just shootin' off his face

329
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,975
- No, he's right
- Look, Cherry

330
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,852
Aw, what George thinks ain't what I think

331
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,014
You go on about your business
any which way you wanna go

332
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,252
Now, look here There ain't any use to this

333
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:12,052
- You don't have to cry
- Please I am a skunk, and I know it

334
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,216
You ain't a skunk

335
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,336
You've been nice,
even though you knew I was lyin'

336
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,856
I'm sorry I drug you into it Goodbye

337
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,969
Look, what kind of a box is it you're in?
Can't you tell me?

338
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:37,452
You see, I've known Monte Jarrad
ever since we was kids

339
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,933
We grew up together
So when he rode in hurt, I tried to help him

340
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,092
- Did you get him out?
- No

341
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,296
They'll catch him now, I guess

342
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,213
The posse'll be pounding back by this evening

343
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,213
When I told you that I'd explain,

344
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:59,374
I decided to tell you the whole truth
and see if you'd help me

345
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,976
Take a saddle,
or anything to lead the posse away

346
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,291
There just wasn't nobody else I could turn to

347
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,779
You'd do anything for that belly gunner

348
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,889
This morning I decided not to
It wouldn't be fair dragging you in no further

349
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,211
I was gonna tell you the truth all right

350
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,850
I wasn't gonna ask you to do nothin' else

351
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,217
That why you brung
Monte's saddle along with you?

352
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,336
What?

353
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,410
Why, I didn't know it was there

354
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:38,529
I thought you might have noticed it
when you put this blanket over it

355
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,409
I don't know why I even try to lie to you

356
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,536
Me neither

357
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,696
Come on, Henry

358
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,294
- What are you doing?
- Changing saddles

359
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,896
- You're gonna do it?
- It's what you wanted, ain't it?

360
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,016
Well, yes, but

361
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,533
Melody, you can make it, can't you?

362
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,575
I hope so.

363
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,699
They'll see you with the saddle
and tell which way you went

364
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,932
You'll have such a lead, you'll make it

365
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,776
If you mean do I aim to get caught,
the answer is no

366
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:36,138
A fella can stand just so much
of that pounding, and then

367
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,568
I'm awful grateful to you

368
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,732
Is there something I can do for you, maybe?

369
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,653
Sure You can take care of my saddle

370
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,175
All right

371
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,175
Melody, ride as hard as you can
and don't stop for nothin'

372
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,692
Goodbye

373
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,536
Well, that sinks the duck

374
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,775
Thank you

375
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,732
Thank you

376
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,375
- I meant goodbye
- Goodbye

377
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,772
Would you take something from me for keeps?

378
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,734
I won it for bronc stomping
last year at Cherryenne

379
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,055
I was 17th.

380
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,656
Thanks, champ

381
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,656
Giddy-up!

382
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,774
Melody! Where you goin'?

383
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,896
Melody!

384
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,889
Whoa

385
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,019
He's gone with your saddle
You can see it a mile off

386
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,731
You said last night he'd left the house
Where'd he stay?

387
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,698
I don't know, Monte He just disappeared

388
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,010
- Start movin'
- Sure, Monte

389
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,098
You know what I'd do if you crossed me

390
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,572
I know you're in trouble,
but I don't like that kind of talk

391
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:05,097
I didn't ask you what you liked
Just be careful what you're doin'

392
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,219
I'm gonna pick up Uncle Roscoe,
and then I'm on my way

393
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:15,330
When you get through with what I told you to do,
I'll send for you Be ready

394
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,497
- Can I get by?
- Ten

395
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,174
- Up ten
- I call

396
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,969
You fellas oughta let people pass
when they ask you

397
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,696
- Waggoner
- Back

398
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,136
You wanna see me?

399
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,576
Sit down

400
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,613
You needn't keep watching my gun

401
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,533
You couldn't stop it

402
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:01,649
There's only three men in these parts
I can't slap leather with One is Monte Jarrad

403
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,572
- But you ain't him
- No?

404
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,210
No You had me fooled for a time, but

405
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,770
not after I thunk it over

406
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:14,694
But you're frontin' for him,
and that's all I wanna know

407
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,256
Where is he?

408
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,697
- I was fixin' to ask you that
- I done my part of that job

409
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:28,092
Now I'm waitin' for you fellas to do yours
You understand?

410
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:34,256
Mister, I'm gonna tell you the truth
I ain't got the first idea what you're talkin' about

411
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:39,733
I want my share I wanna know where
that money bag is You understand that?

412
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,936
No.

413
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:53,497
Then you'd better start remembering You're
gonna tell me before you leave this room

414
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,096
You mean you figure
I know where that money is?

415
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,255
I figure you better

416
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:10,688
Well, I don't know exactly what to say to that

417
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:19,171
Nobody else has to know
Just you and me Fifty-fifty

418
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,336
<i>(Melody hums)</i>

419
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,976
Mister, I swear I don't know
how you've lived as long has you have.

420
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,449
What do you mean?

421
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,339
- Do you remember Morgan Earp?
- Sure

422
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:45,609
He got his spine shot in two
He had his back to a door that had glass in it

423
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,975
Sure What about it?

424
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,497
If you look behind you,
you'll find just that kind of a door

425
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,929
That's the oldest one in the book

426
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,456
That glass is painted over and I know it

427
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,089
Maybe, but I sure wish
you'd give it a second thought

428
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,696
- I've had just about enough of this
- So have I

429
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,216
Hello, Leo

430
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,733
- Who's this?
- I don't know

431
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:30,418
- He's trying to pass himself off as Monte
- I know He's riding Monte's saddle

432
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:35,096
- What deal you making?
- I was trying to find out about things

433
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,899
- What things?
- I got a certain right to

434
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,016
To do what?

435
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,095
Sit here till I ride off

436
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:47,411
Then be someplace where I can find you

437
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,014
You understand?

438
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,613
Yeah

439
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,932
I wanna hear some more
about them rights you're so worried about

440
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,890
Let's go

441
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,016
- Me?
- Come on

442
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,609
Walk ahead of me until we're out in the street

443
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,416
Mount your pony

444
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,371
Mister, I'm obliged to you
for getting me out of that bar

445
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,373
Ride by my off-stirrup, close

446
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,331
- I ain't goin' that way
- You go the way I tell you to

447
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:02,450
I can't understand how in Sam Hill a tramp
like you found a way to kill Monte Jarrad

448
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,776
Get going

449
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,530
Stay where you are

450
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,969
- Now, look, I'm sick and tired
- I'm gonna smoke a cigarette

451
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,779
When I'm done, I'm gonna throw it away

452
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,296
When I throw it away, take care of yourself

453
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,138
Some friend of this belly-bustin' gunman,
I take it

454
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,498
- Say it while you can, tramp
- Figure you're good with a gun yourself

455
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,618
Outside of Monte,
I've never seen anybody better

456
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,975
All I meet today is champions

457
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,769
You shot Monte in the back
You wanna try again?

458
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,579
I aim to pull out of this fix

459
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,858
It ain't my squabble and there's no sense
in getting myself shot

460
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,535
- Monte Jarrad ain't dead
- Did he give you that saddle?

461
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,851
- No, he didn't, but his girl did
- What girl?

462
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,295
- Cherry de Longpre
- Did she kill him?

463
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,213
Ain't nobody killed him, you lunkhead

464
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,490
He got hurt bad and couldn't travel fast

465
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:37,450
I took his saddle as a favour to her,
to fool jackasses like you away from him

466
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:44,173
A full growed man like you could let a girl
talk him into a dang fool trick like that?

467
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,019
All I can say is here I am

468
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:53,334
I've heard some dumb stories in my time,
but that one really takes the cake

469
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,456
Get ready

470
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,009
All right

471
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,695
This don't make no sense to me
in any particular,

472
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,613
but let her go

473
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,930
Put 'em up, black hat

474
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,049
Higher

475
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,415
Take his gun, Melody

476
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,694
Like I told your friend, never turn your back
on anything, especially a woman

477
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,736
It's all right, George

478
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,691
- This the girl?
- Ain't she a lulu?

479
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,738
- Get off
- Just a minute, ma'am

480
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,176
If you're Cherry de Longpre,
you'll know I'm Leo Gledhill

481
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,332
How do you do, Mr Gledhill? Now get off

482
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:52,051
- I'm a friend of Monte Jarrad
- The lady said get off, Mr Gledhill

483
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,617
You jughead We been looking all over for you

484
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,774
Take Mr Gledhill for a walk out in the desert
Way out, and leave him

485
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,171
- Get!
- Leave him and do what?

486
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,299
Follow Melody to where you was headed
in the first place

487
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,816
You're gonna get out of this country
I'm gonna take you

488
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,814
- How do you like that for organisation?
- You know who I am

489
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,531
I don't know who you are,
only who you say you are

490
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,452
But that's who I am

491
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,535
You could be Luke Packard
who works for the express company

492
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,737
- Come on, Melody
- Yes, ma'am

493
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,051
Too bad, partner I know just how you feel

494
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:48,169
If there's anything in the world I like,
it's gettin' saved from bein' shot

495
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,178
# I wished I had a candy box

496
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,370
# To put my sweetheart in

497
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:01,295
# I'd take her out and kiss her twice
And put her back again

498
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,054
- # Round and round #
- Melody

499
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:11,012
You know, Monte'd kill a girl
if she done to him what I done to you

500
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:15,014
That's because Monte
don't understand women very well

501
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,694
I suppose you do?

502
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,853
Pa gave me a piece of advice
that ain't never failed me

503
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:27,777
"If you fool around a woman, hide a dollar
in your boot, then you'll come out with a dollar"

504
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:31,489
"That is," Pa says, "if you keep your boots on"

505
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,616
- What are you gonna do now?
- Tie up with George

506
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,216
Head toward Hot Creek
and work around there this winter

507
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,452
Will you be coming back this way in spring?

508
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,896
Maybe Don't like it much
down there in the summer

509
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:59,018
If you do, will you do something for me?

510
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:03,731
I don't like to seem impolite,
but after the way things been going,

511
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,573
I'd better listen to what it is first

512
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:10,210
I don't blame you
This money bag that Monte took,

513
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:15,329
when you come back, I want you
to give it back to the express company

514
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,695
- Can't
- You mean you won't?

515
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,136
- Don't know where it is
- I'm going to show you

516
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,657
It's in a little adobe house
Under the window sill, there's a slab

517
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:30,769
Under that there's a space
for a man to hide in if he can breathe

518
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:35,297
It's in there Monte told me
when it looked like he was gonna die

519
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,772
- Why don't we give it back to 'em now?
- We certainly will not

520
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,579
- Why not?
- Monte's gotta have his chance

521
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,936
They're looking for him
If that money popped up here,

522
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:50,059
they'd close in so tight
a jack rabbit couldn't get out

523
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:55,135
- We gotta wait till he gets away
- No, I'd better turn it in right now

524
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,133
You can't After promising me,
you wouldn't dare

525
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,451
Promised? When was that I promised?

526
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,372
Well

527
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,694
Well, you gotta promise now

528
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,819
- Oh, well
- Well, do you promise?

529
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,936
All right, I promise

530
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,616
<i>(howling)</i>

531
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,496
<i>(howling)</i>

532
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,695
Melody

533
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,169
I'm awful sorry I hope you understand,

534
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,808
and maybe someday you'll forgive me

535
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,255
Forget it

536
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:50,972
Ain't a thing in the world you've got
to worry about, as far as I'm concerned

537
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:54,257
If you ever do come back through here

538
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:59,016
I tell you, Cherry,
I'd like to see you again a whole lot

539
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:05,938
But I just don't seem to be cut out for the kind
of life you folks lead around these parts

540
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,896
Yeah, I see

541
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:44,218
- Good evening
- Luke Packard's the name

542
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,536
From the express company

543
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,260
Lift your hands just a little higher

544
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,969
And you, lady, step round the other side of him

545
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:05,778
I'd certainly be embarrassed
if you grabbed his iron and flung a shot at me

546
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,455
That's something
that's been worrying me most of my life

547
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:13,613
What would I do if a woman
hung the drop on me?

548
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,771
Boy, oh, boy

549
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,576
Over

550
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:28,171
These don't give much light to speak of,
but they'll warm it up while we wait

551
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,456
- Wait for what?
- The posse

552
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,259
- They're swinging around this way now
- Posse?

553
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:37,379
The sheriff and some of the boys
are heading up here

554
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,293
Go over in that corner

555
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:45,739
What they're aiming to do when they get here,
I couldn't say They didn't tell me

556
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,097
- But you can't do that
- No? Why can't I?

557
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,139
They'll kill him, not arrest him
Those Cotton boys won't let 'em

558
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,133
They're legal, lady Legal to the teeth

559
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,815
I ain't the one they're after
I ain't Monte Jarrad

560
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:03,256
I'm Melody Jones I ain't never set eyes on him

561
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,208
I ain't never seen
the gentleman in question myself

562
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,371
But this is Monte Jarrad's hideout

563
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:13,499
On information received,
this here girl is Monte Jarrad's lady friend

564
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:18,211
Monte Jarrad is well known to be a beanpole,
such as you be

565
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:22,373
When a posse makes a mistake,
it's mighty hard to unmake

566
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,612
Come, now Let's don't look on the dark side

567
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,850
What other side is there, mister?

568
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:34,539
If them Cottons get hold of me, I'm a dead duck
It ain't gonna be no good to say sorry

569
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,737
The fact is, I don't care a hoot

570
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:42,132
whether you're Monte Jarrad
or Melody Jones or Harmony Q Smith

571
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:47,294
All I'm interested in is 42,004 dollars
and 85 cents

572
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,133
belonging to the express company I work for

573
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,768
and not another cussed thing on earth

574
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:58,219
Once I get my hands on that,
you're as free as a bird

575
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,896
- Can I talk to this girl alone?
- Step in there if you want

576
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,893
- You trust me?
- 100 per cent

577
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,051
You'll never regret it, Mr Packard

578
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,780
You'd better take a light with you

579
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:27,372
Well, how do you like that?
He's no better than a cheat

580
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,059
I couldn't break my word in here if I wanted to

581
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:36,178
What did you wanna talk to me about?

582
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:42,332
Oh, yeah Say, what about this?

583
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,776
- What about what?
- About my gettin' hung over this money

584
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,899
- How far are you aimin' to carry this?
- You know the situation

585
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:56,010
You figure if I tell where the money is, it'll hurt
that belly buster's chances of gettin' away

586
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,375
But what about my neck?

587
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:02,215
You have to do what you think is right, of course

588
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,690
You gonna hang onto that promise
you trapped me into?

589
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:10,888
- I'm not gonna argue about it
- Maybe you're in love with him, but I ain't

590
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:15,611
This thing's gone just about far enough,
and ten feet further

591
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,856
Just as you please

592
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,337
- Made up your mind?
- Uh-huh

593
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,219
Well, where is it?

594
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,452
- Where's what?
- The money Stop stalling

595
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,850
What money was it?

596
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:44,969
You realise what you're doin'? That posse
ain't more than 30 minutes from here, Monte

597
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:49,099
- I ain't Monte
- I ain't got any way to force you

598
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:54,414
But I hate to see a man taken apart
without a chance to defend himself

599
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,935
- I'll tell you where it is
- What?

600
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:01,935
The money you're after Can't you keep
your mind on what we're talking about?

601
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:07,618
- If I tell you where it is, can we go?
- That was the proposition

602
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:11,739
- Which man do you aim to be the death of?
- Shut up

603
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,653
It's under that slab under the window

604
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,979
Well, what do you know about that?
Mister, you're a

605
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,017
<i>(gunshot)</i>

606
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,929
Then you were telling the truth

607
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,453
Yeah

608
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,259
Look out for the fella doin' the shootin'

609
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:54,571
It's the real Monte He's after the money again

610
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,856
Is he dead?

611
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,296
Yeah

612
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,295
Shh

613
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,735
There's somebody out there

614
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:30,330
- Is that the way you always draw?
- You numbskull

615
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:35,619
I'm sorry, but I couldn't be sure who was in here

616
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:47,052
- Who is it?
- Packard, the express-company fella

617
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,780
Well, that sinks the duck

618
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,010
Now they got a "corpus delict"

619
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,452
- A what?
- A dead body

620
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:59,410
That's the way the law says it
If they've got a corpus, you're delict

621
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:03,175
Before this, we could have proved
there was a mistake

622
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,616
- Then why did you do it?
- We could have

623
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,850
- Do what?
- Shoot him

624
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:11,011
- Him?
- Why did you shoot him?

625
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:15,458
Why should I shoot the man,
a perfect stranger? Why should I?

626
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:19,818
Wait a minute
Both of you, you can't hang it on me

627
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,097
You was under the table with your gun smokin'

628
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:28,812
How do you account for that hole?
He ran outside, shot him, then came back in?

629
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,816
That's right

630
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:38,734
If it wasn't you,
we've got that belly buster back with us

631
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,892
Melody, we gotta
get outta this country and quick

632
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:45,575
- Ain't nothin' holdin' me back
- All right

633
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,890
But first you get the pony

634
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:51,018
Keep your eyes open
Maybe somebody's still out there

635
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,217
Don't you think
we oughta keep clotted together?

636
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,019
Stop trying to think Do as I say

637
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,410
All right

638
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,213
We got housekeeping to do before we leave

639
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:12,692
Give me a hand
Let's get this corpus into that box

640
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,690
Here, help cover up these spots

641
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,612
- You with us?
- You bet

642
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,736
Come on

643
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:35,775
Step back

644
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,896
You're under arrest

645
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:45,179
Light those candles, Kriendler
Let's see what's going on in here

646
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,096
Stick 'em up, fella

647
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:16,851
- I can't say I expected much more of you
- This him?

648
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:20,649
- Ain't it?
- Do I have to go through all that again?

649
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,972
Sheriff, he isn't Monte
He's just some guy that's got all mixed up

650
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:28,610
- Hold me Put me in jail
- You think I'm crazy?

651
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:31,340
They're prominent in this county, the Cottons

652
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:36,255
If I was to let him go,
they're as liable to string me up

653
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:42,450
Take it easy They'll be along any minute
If he ain't who they want, they won't touch him

654
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,088
Look, Sheriff, if they hang me,

655
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,809
how are you gonna find out
where the money is?

656
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,698
<i>(coughs)</i>

657
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:56,614
You know where the money is,
even if you ain't Monte?

658
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:59,453
- I do
<i>- (coughs)</i>

659
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,731
- What ails you?
- Nothing

660
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,972
Just clearing my throat

661
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,698
Well?

662
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:15,773
- If I tell you, can I get outta here?
- If I was you

663
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:20,092
If he opens his mouth one more time,
knock him in the head

664
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:25,095
I give you my word The minute
that money's in my hand, that door's open

665
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,012
- It's right

No!

Come on?

670

Try any monkey business
and I'll blow you clear outta this house

671
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:51,008
Where's that money? You said
you knew where it is Let's have it, quick

672
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:55,139
- I'm afraid I changed my mind
- I'm giving you one more chance

673
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:59,213
Tell us, or do we have to get it outta you?

674
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,940
I don't think I got any suggestions

675
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,170
Get ahold of him Pin him

676
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:09,538
Anybody touches me
is gonna get their brains knocked out

You brush ape How did you think
you were gonna stop a man?

680
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,770
What are you doin' here?

681
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,249
Just lightin' a candle

682
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,934
Melody, why didn't you go?

683
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,977
I reached for you, but I couldn't find you

684
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,779
I couldn't leave you in all this mess

685
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:58,014
Maybe I can be as tough as this Monte Jarrad
Maybe a little bit tougher

686
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,259
- Let's get outta here
- They stampeded our horses

687
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,854
Well, what do you know?

688
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,460
For the last time, where's that money?

689
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,975
I forget

690
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:21,737
All right, put your guns away
and go to work on him

691
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:26,451
Don't knock his head clear off him
because he's gotta talk, and quick

692
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,376
You

693
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,056
You get over there

694
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,176
Get him

695
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:50,688
Whop him, Melody Whop him!

696
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:08,494
Get your hands off me

697
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,856
I got him

698
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,890
Wait a minute Bring him out here

699
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:24,179
Where is it?

700
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,292
Let him have it

701
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:33,010
Hold it We gotta try somethin' else

702
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:36,490
- Why?
- You'll knock him out, then what good is he?

703
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:43,133
- Want me to heat up his spurs?
- No, the way he said it, it's in this room

704
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,690
The way he said it, it must be

705
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,256
It's got to be

706
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:57,255
There's a stiff in here

707
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:59,376
Holy jumping Jupiter!

708
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,974
- It's Luke Packard
- Luke Packard?

709
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:04,096
It is Luke all right

710
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,136
Run for it

711
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,333
Hey!

712
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,298
Open this door!

713
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:17,293
Come on back!
Come back here and open this door!

714
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,416
Come back here!

715
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:28,094
Cherry? Cherry?

716
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:32,418
Cherry? Cherry?

717
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,489
Cherry? Cherry?

718
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:49,179
Monte's headed for the de Longpre range
Come on, let's go!

719
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:08,736
Cherry?

720
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,656
Cherry?

721
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,856
Cherry?

722
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,855
Hi

723
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:29,614
You can stop thinkin' what you're thinkin'

724
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:33,136
because you won't have time to throw that can

725
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,660
And you're too far for that Winchester

726
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:50,298
I thought you might be that Monte Jarrad,
but that can't be

727
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,054
- No?
- No

728
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:56,417
That weasel looks somethin' like I do
Fools people sometimes

729
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,174
Get over there

730
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:07,253
Take off that holster

731
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,376
And the boots

732
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:28,536
Don't think we look alike, hm?

733
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:33,455
I don't think I deserve people
to say anything like that about me

734
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,176
The jumper

735
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:49,691
It ain't gonna do you no good, you know

736
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:59,090
You don't think so?

737
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:07,220
Not even if we swapped every stitch.

738
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:15,809
'Cause there still wouldn't be
no scar on my face

739
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,973
But who'd know that if there wasn't no face left?

740
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:25,814
- Is that what you really aim to do?
- The pants

741
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:36,693
I didn't come lookin' for you
just to admire you, if that's what you mean

742
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:40,136
In that case, I guess I'd better fix you too

743
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:45,409
You ain't doin' this just because it suits you to

744
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,413
You got something else on your mind

745
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:50,810
Yeah?

746
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:56,899
Yeah But I ain't gonna help you with it none

747
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:59,620
I'm gonna make you ask about it

748
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:05,059
All right What about it?

749
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,895
- What about what?
- What about Cherry?

750
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:11,016
What about her?

751
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,575
You'll have to be clearer than that

752
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:18,698
- You know what I'm asking you
- Sure

753
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:23,935
But you're gonna have to ask it in plain words

754
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:29,015
- What were you doin' here the other night?
- If I don't tell you, you'll never know

755
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:33,412
- You'll tell me all right
- Will I?

756
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:39,097
Don't get smart I don't like it
And you won't like it either

757
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:42,536
What could you do
that you weren't gonna do already?

758
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:46,659
That's what I meant when I say
I'm gonna fix you too

759
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:51,450
I ain't gonna answer that question
I'm gonna leave you to worry about that

760
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:54,453
But she ain't yours no more

761
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:58,169
- You're lying
- You see?

762
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:01,616
That's what you're going to have to worry about

763
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:06,774
Was I lying or not?
With me gone, you'll never know

764
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:10,819
From now on, you'll have to
go on wondering about that,

765
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:15,929
for as long as you live,
which I don't figure to be very long

766
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,936
Come on

767
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:31,016
The hat

768
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:51,496
<i>(Melody hums)</i>

769
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:56,650
Know what you are now?
YOu're just an old used-to-be.

770
01:10:56,820 --> 01:11:01,575
If you don't think so, ask her yourself
She's comin' in right now

771
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:13,015
You better get out to the barn
George is there He's hurt

772
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:15,936
Bad?

773
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,056
I think he's dyin'

774
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:29,016
All right, go on

775
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,900
Why did you shoot that old man?

776
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:42,329
He come asking for it Anytime somebody
comes asking for it, they're gonna get it

777
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:46,138
Found him in the gulch where you left him

778
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,860
Where you left him to die

779
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:56,220
You're wearin' his stuff

780
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:58,940
So the tramp was tellin' the truth

781
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:05,411
Monte, you were gonna kill him too

782
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:08,538
and leave him here to be buried as yourself

783
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:21,937
Get your dumb thumb out of my eye

784
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:26,378
- I was just trying to see if you were dead
- Well, I ain't

785
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:30,499
And I don't like somebody
trying to gouge my eye out

786
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:36,898
- Monte?
- Yeah I stumbled onto him up in the rocks

787
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:40,177
You can't, Monte
Look out, Melody! He's coming!

788
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:45,454
Take care of yourself, tramp

789
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:49,852
Take my gun, Melody Take it and drill him

790
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:52,170
Partner, you ain't got no gun

791
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:07,532
Get outta here They're comin'

792
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,734
Inside

793
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:16,980
- You two cover that door
- Yeah

794
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,656
Leo, the front door

795
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,252
- Come back here
- Stop me

796
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:32,376
<i>(gunfire)</i>

797
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:36,376
- Look, Melody
- Sit down

798
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:40,975
Surrender in the name of the law!

799
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:50,294
- Take that horse and cut for it
- Why don't Monte go?

800
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:54,294
He can't race a horse
with that wound, but you can

801
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:58,009
She's right You can't do
no more damage around here

802
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:01,172
- No, I ain't goin'
- Why not?

803
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:03,649
Horse like that can't carry three people

804
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,020
Looks like we're gonna have company

805
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:52,774
- Did you get him?
- What for?

806
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:56,091
I ain't got anything against them fellas out there

807
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:01,054
- Get down You'll get your head shot off
- Why did you shoot?

808
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:03,370
He was shootin' too straight

809
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,976
George

810
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:13,531
Listen, George, only one thing
about this business still puzzles me

811
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:18,171
- What's that?
- What I'm doin' in it

812
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:21,616
You was gonna make somethin' out of yourself

813
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:24,658
- Don't you remember?
- That's right

814
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:28,256
You was gonna take Monte and be somebody

815
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:33,531
- That sounds kinda silly now, I reckon
<i>- (gunfire continues)</i>

816
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:41,130
All I'm askin' you now is,
tell me when you figure you is somebody

817
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:45,259
so we can get the heck
out of this shootin' gallery

818
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:50,258
Is that really why you stayed?

819
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,056
Well, not exactly

820
01:15:55,180 --> 01:16:01,574
The truth is, I hadn't hardly got into
that idea good before I kinda got sick of it

821
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:04,573
Too jumpy to suit my taste

822
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:07,618
Why did you ride back into Payneville?

823
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,738
You was all tangled up in something

824
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,368
I couldn't rightly figure out what

825
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:16,498
No use tryin' to talk sense into your head

826
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:19,015
The only way to get you out

827
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:24,618
was for me to try to get inside
and bust open the whole shebang

828
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:30,537
It never occurred to me that maybe
you had reasons not to want to get out

829
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:46,176
Melody

830
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,060
What is it, Uncle Roscoe?

831
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,456
Where's my gun?

832
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:57,810
You ain't got no gun, George

833
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:01,495
You'd better give me one, Melody

834
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:05,170
If them fellas break in

835
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:09,974
you're gonna need some help

836
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:20,616
Here you are, George

837
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,696
Got it?

838
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:25,816
Yeah

839
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:33,848
Don't make out
you're worse off than you are, George

840

Here Drink some of this

841
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:39,296
<i>(gunfire continues)</i>

842
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:46,336
<i>(hums vey softly)</i>

843
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:57,098
We can't stand for this from nobody, George

844
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:09,018
- Hey, now

845
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:11,933

846
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,660
- Stop him, Avery!

847
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:20,336
I'm sorry

848
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,138
Hey, Monte Jarrad!

849
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,256
What about it?

850
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:34,816
What about it, Monte?

851
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,576

01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,253

853
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:49,376

01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:53,693
Hey, men! Hold your fire!

855
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:56,977
Hold your fire! Let 'em shoot it out!

856
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:07,498
This one's for that scar on your face

857
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,896
You're walkin' too good

858
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:24,578
That one was a little too close

859
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:30,738
No face left, remember?

860
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:12,015
Thanks, partner

861
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:21,135
# I'm a poor lonesome cowboy

862
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:25,210
# I'm a poor lonesome cowboy

863
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:29,218
# I ain't got no sweetheart

864
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:33,373
# I'm a long way from home #

865
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:38,129
Come on You can bring your hat this time

866
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:49,499
# I ain't got no sweetheart

867
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:53,016
# I ain't got no sweetheart

868
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:56,331
# I'm a poor lonesome cowboy #

869
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:10,377
What a dumb town!
They catch you and then they don't hang you

870
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:13,976
They slung me in and they slung me out

871
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:18,099
- You still tryin' to make out you're bad off?
- Have you ever?

872
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:21,172
- What's this?
- Reward for drilling Monte

873
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:24,093
They held back 25 dollars for the doctor,

874
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:27,297
five dollars on a charge of vagrancy,

875
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:31,294
three weeks' rent for living in the jail
when I wasn't guilty

876
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:34,896
- Why are you givin' it to me?
- You brung him down

877
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:38,575
Me? I couldn't have brung down
a two-week-old baby

878
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:43,370
I was so dreamy, I couldn't hardly move,
let alone use a drilling iron

879
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:46,452
But you had to, George It wasn't me

880
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:49,896
That shot came straight from this barn

881
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:52,449
- Avery?
- Flat out

882
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:55,453
- Pop, maybe?
- No, I had his gun

883
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,809
This is awful, George Awful

884
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:04,258
Who do you care saved your life?
I'd let anybody save mine

885
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,059
- I'm givin' up
- Givin' up what?

886
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:11,657
Everything I ain't gonna make
no further fool of myself about her

887
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:17,213
- What in the Sam Hill are you talking about?
- She knowed him long before me

888
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:21,009
It was him or me, one or the other

889
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:24,889
She had a right
to shoot at whoever she wanted to

890
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:30,612
Melody, if you mean what I think you mean,
get outta my sight

891
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:35,774
- You ain't worthy for me to know
- I've been kiddin' myself too long

892
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:38,295
I know who she was aimin' at

893
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:52,576
Come in

894
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,016
Hello

895
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:07,493
- I was looking for my saddle
- Behind the curtain

896
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,256
What's that?

897
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,650
The reward

898
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:16,492
Oh

899
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:21,256
- I hoped you wouldn't take it like that
- I ain't blamin' you

900
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:24,696
It ain't no disgrace to be saved by a woman

901
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:28,011
What kind of a chump do you take me for?

902
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:31,616
You think I don't know who you were shootin' at?

903
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:33,611
- What?
- Look, Cherry

904
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:39,935
When a fella puts himself between a fella
and his girl, he's got to look out on both sides

905
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:43,979
- He's got to be ready
- You mean I was shootin' at you?

906
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:50,170
I ain't blamin' you You had to make
a quick pick which fella you wanted

907
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:54,492
I'm mighty glad
you ain't any better shot than you are

908
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:58,050
Thanks for takin' care of my saddle for me

909
01:23:58,820 --> 01:24:03,211
Why, you you butter-fingered gun juggler

910
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:12,692
Melody

911
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:16,889
Cherry!

912
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,976
Hold it

913
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:27,938
When I aim at somethin', I hit it

914
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:31,649
And when I hit somethin', that's what I aimed at

915
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:48,530
Don't tell me she missed you all three times

916
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:51,419
- I've changed my mind, George
- What now?

917
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:58,529
I decided I don't wanna be sheriff

918
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:01,772
Well, that's a right smart decision

919
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:05,899
I'm thinking it's about time
I was thinking about settling down

920
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:12,530
A fella that knew about ranching
could make this dump into a nice place

921
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,533
- If he had a good foreman
- You ask her?

922
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:18,931
- Ask her what?
- For the job, you numpus

923
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:24,128
- You don't think I ought to go to Pop?
- Go away You disgust me

924
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:28,494
Well, if you think that's the way

925
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:43,936
<i>(Melody hums)</i>

926
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:50,690
<i>(Cherry)</i> Melody, stop it

927
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:52,816
Stop it, I tell you Stop

928
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:03,179
My goodness
You don't have to be so rough about it
