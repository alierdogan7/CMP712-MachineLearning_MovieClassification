[all muttering]

180
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,516
Now, get him down
and cut him loose.

181
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,475
Come on, fellas, it's hot.

182
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,916
Just how many holes
you want to dig?

183
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,319
Down on your bellies.

184
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,995
[laughing]

185
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,957
Seems to remind you
of somethin', don't it?

186
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,236
Yeah, only it was
the other way around.

187
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,515
Old Man Childer's barn?

188
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Yeah.

189
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,711
I recall
his daughter was there, too.

190
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,393
And her brothers
comin' after you.

191
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,473
Yeah. I had a hell of a time
pullin' my boots on.

192
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,874
It wasn't just your boots,
little brother.

193
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,639
What're you doin' here?

194
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,234
Just passin' through.

195
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,356
You?

196
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,312
Doesn't matter anymore.

197
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,594
It's good to see you, Dal.
Especially alive.

198
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,837
Good to see you, too, Mac.

199
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,875
Let's go home.

200
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,915
[neighing]

201
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,674
You know, Mac,

202
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,711
half a day's ride,
we'll be home.

203
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,277
Does Kate know
you're comin'?

204
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,192
Nobody knows I'm comin'.

205
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,953
Sure did miss her.

206
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,355
I got a feelin'
it was more than home cookin'.

207
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,119
[horses neighing]

208
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,116
(Dal)
Where is everybody?

209
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,350
(Mac)
Pa?

210
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,750
Mama?

211
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,234
[birds chirping]

212
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,154
[gun clicking]

213
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,156
(man)
Don't neither
one of you move.

214
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
Pa?

215
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,359
Mac, is that you?

216
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,318
Well, of course it's me.

217
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,314
[door creaking]

218
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,437
Well, it's a good thing
you yelled out, boy.

219
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,318
I was all set to shoot.

220
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,552
Who's that with you, boy?

221
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,036
It's me, Pa. Dal.

222
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,879
By God, it is.

223
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,716
(Pa)
Ma, you better come out here.

224
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,674
Take a good look, Mother.

225
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,114
They got it wrong.

226
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,793
Damn, I knew they did.

227
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,553
Quit your swearin', Luke.

228
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,155
Dal, is it you?

229
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,033
How you doin', Mama?

230
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,472
There's only one man
in the world with that voice.

231
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,475
Underneath that grizzle,
it's his face.

232
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,077
The army told us
you were dead.

233
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,030
Oh, son.

234
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,393
Mac, give me a hug.

235
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,516
[spits]

236
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,800
[chuckling]

237
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,591
Hey, where are the girls?

238
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,473
What happened, Ma?

239
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,996
Let me get a jug,
and I'll tell you.

240
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,355
Hold this.

241
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,676
They were in this place
before anybody knew it.
Tore it apart.

242
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,519
When they pulled out,

243
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,595
they took Sissy
and Heather with them.

244
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,318
Jesse tried fightin' 'em off,
but they just hit too fast.

245
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,232
You mean Jesse was here?

246
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Two months ago.

247
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,190
He got wounded
somewhere in Tennessee,
and they sent him home.

248
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,677
Looks like
you put up a fight.

249
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,111
Oh, I managed
to get off
a couple of shots,

250
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,600
but there was just
too many of 'em.

251
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,637
Comanches have
got nothin' on them.

252
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,949
They took all the livestock

253
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,680
and just about
every speck of food
we had in the place.

254
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,434
You keep sayin' "they," Pa.
Who're you talkin' about?

255
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,957
Soldiers. Like him. Rebs.

256
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,796
You got any idea
where they went?

257
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,270
South is all
anybody seems to know.

258
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,275
Mama? You all right?

259
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,358
She ain't slept
since it happened.

260
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,194
How can I sleep
when they stole my children?

261
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,351
What about the Connery place?

262
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,954
Kate all right?

263
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,519
(Pa)
Kate was here.
Came for supper.

264
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,512
You mean she's with them?

265
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,149
You know Kate,
she'd give 'em a fight.

266
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,115
What about the law?
What've they been doin'?

267
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,352
Not much they could do
without gettin' folks killed.

268
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,152
And if it's Gillette
you're talkin' about,
he wasn't even around.

269
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,277
Where the hell's he been
the last few days?

270
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,080
I figure
I'll go into town
and ask him that.

271
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,516
Go get my children
and you bring 'em back.

272
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,910
Don't worry, Mama,
we'll find them.

273
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,313
Mac, I don't want
you havin' a run-in
with Miles Gillette.

274
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,519
You might kill him.

275
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,796
[snickers]

276
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,792
Why don't you stay here
with the folks?

277
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,351
I'm gonna ride over
to the Sparks' place
and talk to Shorty.

278
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,832
Yeah, I guess you're right.

279
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,517
Somebody ought to stay
with Ma and Pa.

280
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,910
You just find out
who did it, Dal.

281
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,833
Be ready to ride.

282
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,559
[horses neighing]

283
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,914
[bell ringing]

284
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,795
[snorting]

285
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,555
Dal? I'll be doggone.

286
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,917
Everybody had you
dead and buried
for dang near a year.

287
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,511
Good to see
you're still kickin'.

288
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,913
How are you, Miles?

289
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,070
You got any idea
who hit our folks' place?

290
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,072
And all we know
is a band of renegades

291
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,674
swept through
about a week ago.

292
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,592
Hit about
a half a dozen places
in the county,

293
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,239
then just disappeared.

294
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,674
Eh, how many of 'em?

295
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,638
Oh, about a dozen of 'em,
from what I heard.

296
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,189
Armed to the teeth.
Had some wagons with 'em.

297
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,671
Some of 'em full of grain,
others were carryin'
prisoners.

298
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,436
Where were you
when all of this was goin' on?

299
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,752
I was down in Converse,
runnin' down a prisoner
of my own.

300
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,275
That's, kind of,
out of your territory,
isn't it?

301
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,680
Yep, a ways.

302
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,116
But I wanted
to see this man locked up.

303
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,113
Happens he was a kin
of yours, your Uncle Jack.

304
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,681
Dal, even if I'd been here
when the renegades
come through,

305
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,439
there's nothin'
I could have done about it.

306
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,954
You could've gone after 'em.

307
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,633
They didn't leave much choice.

308
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,519
Said anyone tried followin',
they'd find nothin'
but bodies.

309
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Dal?

310
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,040
Hello, Frank.

311
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,639
Sorry you had to come back
to somethin' like this.

312
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,916
Appears
they hit your place, too.

313
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,999
Happens I was out
at your folks', with Kate.

314
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,199
We were engaged, Dal.
Gonna get married.

315
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,517
We all thought you were dead.

316
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,197
Pa said
they were headed south.

317
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,556
Yeah, pulled out
about four days ago.

318
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,275
I got a feelin'
you're goin' after 'em.

319
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,473
Mac's out at the place now.
He'll ride with me.

320
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,157
Sharp's. Take 'em.

321
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,274
Knock the stripes off a skunk
from 500 yard.

322
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,194
Thanks, Miles.

323
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,874
[horse neighing]

324
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,195
I'm sorry.

325
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,358
She's a hell of a woman.

326
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,755

[gasps]

331
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,350
I want to go home.

332
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,830
I know, Heather. We all do.

333
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,040
Why hasn't someone
come to help us, Kate?

334
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,793
Someone has to come.

335
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,360
We can't count on that.

336
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,080
[whispering]
We've got to do it ourselves.

337
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
How?

338
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,878
I'm gonna talk to Jesse.

339
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,119
Do you think they'll let you?

340
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,078
Only one way to find out.

341
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,959
Watch yourself, Kate.

342
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,920
[cattle mooing]

343
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,995
Hold it.

344
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,558
How're the girls holdin' up?

345
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,359
They want to go home.

346
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,030
Kate, if they take
us all to Mexico,
we don't have a chance.

347
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,679
Maybe this'll help.

348
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,319
Where'd you get that?

349
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,797
From Dal, when we were kids.

350
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,276
I keep thinkin'
I'm gonna look up someday,

351
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,400
and there he is.

352
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,960
He's dead, Jesse.

353
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,713
I don't believe that.

354
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,990
He's too ornery.

355
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,594
[horse neighing]

356
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,199
I might need some help.

357
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,351
I'll be waitin'
for your move.

358
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,074
Ms. Connery?

359
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,438
Get back to the women.

360
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,039
[seagulls cawing]

361
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,840
And as for you,

362
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,551
whatever it is
you're hatchin', forget it,
or end up dead.

363
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,750
(Mac)
Horses, cattle,

364
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,030
three or four wagons,
all of 'em carryin'
a real load.

365
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,191
(Dal)
Yeah, a regular caravan.

366
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,272
They're headin'
for the coast.

367
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,114
Figured they'd head
straight for Mexico.
I don't get it.

368
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,759
Maybe they're goin'
for a swim.

369
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,309
Well, they can swim
in the Rio Grande.

370
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,760
[cattle mooing]

371
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,719
No matter what happens,
I want you
to stay out of the way.

372
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,280
What are you up to?

373
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,919
Just do as I say.

374
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,280
Ms. Connery.

375
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,999
Please, sit down.

376
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,271
I was wonderin'
when we'd have
a little time to visit.

377
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,391
(Kate)
Why are you doing this?

378
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,073
I have my reasons.

379
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,120
No reason could be worth
what you're doing.

380
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,715
I'm talkin' about the South,
Ms. Connery,

381
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,395
and a way of life
that was taken from us.

382
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,160
What makes you think
you can get it back?

383
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,874
Ms. Connery,

384
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,680
the rebel yell
was first heard at Manassas,

385
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,430
and at 100 battles since then,
from Richmond to Gettysburg.

386
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,716
The rebel yell
is hard to describe.

387
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,316
It's a mixture of fear
and anger and exaltation

388
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,679
but it inspires men,
even from defeat.

389
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,156
These damn Yankees think
they've heard the last of it,

390
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,754
but they haven't,

391
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,435
and I'm gonna get it back
any way I can.

392
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,513
These people
have nothing to do
with any of that.

393
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,954
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

394
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,594
[man coughing]

395
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,549
Hey, you,

396
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,916
these ropes
are startin' my wrists
to bleed.

397
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,992
How about makin' 'em looser?

398
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,234
[men shouting]

399
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,480
[guns firing]

400
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,991
(sentry)
Somebody's escapin'.

401
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,040
Hold your fire.

402
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,713
I don't want him dead.

403
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,031
(man)
I'll get him. I'll get him.

404
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,953
[soldiers clamouring]

405
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,717
(Ashbury)
I said, no shootin'.

406
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
Major!

407
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,595
Kill him.

408
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,474
[women gasping]

409
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,000
[guns firing]

410
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,636
(Ashbury)
That's the end of him.

411
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,432
Too bad, he would've brought
a good price in Mexico.

412
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,509
[sobbing]

413
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,394
(Mac)
Great idea of yours,
takin' this canyon.

414
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,159
It's hot enough to pop corn.

415
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,310
[fly buzzing]

416
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,914
Get a leg broke.

417
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,352
Everything seems
to have a bite to it,

418
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,035
and I'm smellin'
like an old sheepherder.

419
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,831
Mac, they got
a four-day jump on us.

420
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,598
This canyon's the shortest way
I know to the coast.

421
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,116
Yeah.

422
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,759
Come on, big brother.

423
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,796
What's got your back up?
You ain't said much
the last couple of hours.

424
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,314
Uh, it's Kate.

425
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,355
I never figured
that woman to run off.

426
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,989
Well, Dal,
she thought you were dead.

427
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,197
Well, she might have waited
to find out.

428
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,919
I mean, Frank King!

429
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,433
Nice enough fella.

430
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,075
Owns a big ranch,
runs a lot of cattle.

431
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,994
[horse neighing]

432
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,840
Always said
there never could be
no other man.

433
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,709
Hell, even if I was dead,
she didn't give me a chance
to get cold.

434
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,276
You're right. Forget her.

435
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,592
What do you mean, forget her?

436
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,275
She might have had
her reasons, you know.

437
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,554
[waves crashing]

438
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,240
[cattle mooing]

439
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,272
I'm sorry about your friend.

440
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,036
Go on.

441
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,398
You don't have to end up
like the others, Ms. Connery.

442
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,234
I would like to
take you back south with me.

443
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,350
I can offer you, a--
A more genteel way of life.

444
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,436
You go back there,
and they'll shoot you.

445
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,354
You're not a soldier anymore,
you're an outlaw.

446
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,116
I'm still
Major Cooper Ashbury,
and they'll follow me.

447
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,077
What about the Traven girls?

448
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,593
They'll end up
in Chihuahua eventually.

449
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,832
What about you, Ms. Connery?

450
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,071
Does my proposal interest you?

451
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,949
Nothing about you
interests me, Major.

452
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,111
I'd rather end up
in Chihuahua.

453
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,075
[panting]

454
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,275
[grunting]

455
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,155
[coughing]

456
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,038
She's comin' in, Major.

457
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,837
Bring down the trade goods
and all the people now
onto the beach.

458
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,115
Yes, sir.

459
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,760
Attention, men!

460
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,711
Bring down the trade goods
and the people
to the beach now!

461
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,792
Look, there's the ship.

462
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,714
(man)
You heard the Lieutenant!

463
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,190
Don't just stand there gapin',
move!

464
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,758
Pull them wagons round.

465
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,636
(Lt. Butler)
Soldier, get these women
lined up with the others.

466
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,874
Get up.
Don't you touch her.

467
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,155
[groans]

468
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,680
Hell in petticoats.
Don't touch 'em, Hardy.

469
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
Ow!

470
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,520
Get in there.

471
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,274
Come on, let's get in there.
Get in there.

472
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,236
(man)
Take it right up to shore.

473
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,600
Careful, <i>señor.</i>

474
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,716
Colonel Hammond,
I'm Major Ashbury.

475
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,038
Even down here, Major,
we're aware
that the war is over.

476
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,635
It's not for me,
or for my men.

477
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,677
That's why I contacted you.

478
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,514
We're in the market
for arms and ammunition.

479
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,595
We plan to go back
and kill the Yankees.

480
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,596
Well, it's a relief
to see that you don't
hold a grudge, Major.

481
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,472
I'd like to see the guns.

482
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,630
Surely.

483
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,790
Rifle.

484
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,552
Lieutenant.
(Lt. Butler)
Sir?

485
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,196
I'll need 200 more,
and ammunition.

486
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,437
That is not a problem, Major.

487
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,591
I'd like to see
the rest of the guns now.

488
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,717
You can't. They're not here.

489
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,479
Then where are they?

490
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,438
Two days sailing from here.

491
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,196
I've run guns
for too long, Major.

492
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,910
I make it a practise
to see the other man's
merchandise first.

493
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,999
Then take a look.

494
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,317
I guarantee these women
will bring a good price.

495
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,837
The men I took are strong,
they're ideal for workin'
in the silver mines.

496
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,912
Plus a herd of cattle
and horses.

497
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,229
That's the grain?

498
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,040
Most of it.
We have close to a ton.

499
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,034
I understand
Maximilian needs it
to feed his troops,

500
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,157
and you do business
with Maximilian.

501
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,709
I do business
with the highest bidder.

502
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,200
She won't do.

503
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,278
She's strong.
She's a hard worker.

504
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,149
So is a mule, but it's not
what they're interested in
down there.

505
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,039
You see, this is what
they're interested in.

506
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,392
Young and fresh.

507
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,920
And spirited.

508
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,670
What's your price?

509
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,479
They're not for sale.

510
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,512
She speak for you, Major?

511
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,759
They are special.

512
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,434
Well, I agree.

513
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,991
Blonde hair is rare
south of the border,
brings a good price.

514
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,197
And red hair's
even more rare.

515
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,751
I'll give you $1,000 for her.

516
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,431
Well, what'll it be,
Ms. Connery?

517
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,991
I meant
what I said last night.

518
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,789
Throw in a dozen rifles,
and she's yours.

519
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
Done.

520
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,070
Too bad.

521
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,033
[insects chirping]

522
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,556
Get his boots.

523
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,676
Yeah.

524
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,149
[gunshot]

525
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,396
Dal.

526
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,920
Mac?

527
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,912
At least he remembers us.

528
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,794
Dal, it is you.

529
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,916
[panting]

530
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,673
They said you were--
I know,

531
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,070
I'm gettin' tired
of hearin' that.

532
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,960
(Jesse)
Yeah, they were Rebs,
all right.

533
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,474
Still fightin' the war.

534
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,029
Man leadin' 'em
calls himself Ashbury.

535
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,430
Cooper Ashbury? A Major?

536
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,035
That's him.

537
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,876
The men he's ridin' with

538
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,031
would follow him
straight into hell
if he called it.

539
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,713
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

540
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,634
You're right about
them followin' him
into hell, they would.

541
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,552
I rode with him once myself.

542
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,632
Why did they take
so many hostages?

543
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,713
Figured we'd be worth
somethin' to slave traders.

544
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,640
Comancheros.

545
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,958
Sell the men for slave labour
in the silver mines,

546
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,831
take the women
down to Chihuahua
and sell them for--

547
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,798
Yeah, we get the picture.

548
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,591
The folks,
how they doin' anyway?

549
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
[sighs]

550
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,037
Sittin' home alone, waitin'.

551
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,798
Well, at least
they're together.

552
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,880
Yup.

553
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,670
They always done
just fine together.

554
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,919
[waves crashing]

555
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,597
How're the girls doin'?
They all right?

556
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,399
Uh, Heather's scared.

557
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,114
Sissy's lookin' out for her,
and Kate's lookin' out
for both of them.

558
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,512
Hear you got yourself wounded
somewhere in Tennessee.

559
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,115
Shoulder.

560
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,152
But it's all right now.

561
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,274
Did, uh, Ma tell you
what colour I was wearin'?

562
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,477
Blue, grey, it doesn't matter.

563
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,078
A man fights
for what he believes in.
Just be glad it's over.

564
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,514
Amen to that.

565
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,873
[seagulls cawing]

566
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,200
Can you ride?

567
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,155
[grunts]

568
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,159
Yeah, I can ride.

569
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,833
Goin' in the mornin'.

570
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,034
[waves crashing]

571
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,513
[seagulls cawing]

572
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,672
When do we go for the guns?

573
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,280
The first tide.

574
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,319
But there'll only be yourself
and two men allowed along.

575
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,800
There's the grain
and the prisoners.

576
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,599
No room for everyone.

577
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,718
What about the horses
and the cattle?

578
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,033
My men will drive 'em down
when we come back,
in four or five days.

579
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,518
You have a deal, Major.

580
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,753
You can trust me.

581
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,034
I was wondering
if you would care to join me.

582
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,474
The pheasant
in this part of the country
is extraordinary.

583
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,517
Cooked with wine and sage.

584
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,473
You must be starved.

585
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,476
Well?

586
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,397
If you're thinking
of using that knife
on me, don't.

587
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,150
And if I did?

588
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,550
That man out there
would shoot you.

589
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,109
Thereby making you
a somewhat less attractive
dinner partner.

590
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,675
Allow me.

591
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,753
What happens to us now?

592
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,115
Chihuahua?

593
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,200
No.

594
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,750
Not you.

595
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,277
You're much too good
for that.

596
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,634
Why not Mexico City,
St. Louis, New Orleans?

597
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,354
I'm really tempted
to take you along with me,

598
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,714
but I'm just afraid
that I'd awaken some morning

599
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,554
and find
you'd made a necklace
with my teeth.

600
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,392
No, you'll stay here for now.

601
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,994
What about the girls?

602
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,878
They're coming with me.

603
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,633
I'd rather go with them.

604
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,870
I'm sorry.

605
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,360
I'll be back in a while,

606
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,114
and then we'll decide
what to do with you.

607
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,630
(man)
Put your backs into it, boys!

608
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,720
(Jesse)
Oh, God.

609
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,435
Kate's there,
but they took the girls.

610
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,240
[grunts]

611
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,434
[birds chirping]

612
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,275
[snorting]

613
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,600
[both grunting]

614
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,640
[cows mooing]

615
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,835
[yelling]

616
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,360
[gun firing]

617
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,790
(man)
Stampede! Stampede!

618
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,040
Ya!

619
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,394
[cows mooing]

620
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,479
[horses neighing]

621
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,474
[guns firing]

622
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,150
[groans]

623
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,632
You cut that kind of close,
didn't you?

624
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,439
I got sand in my eye.

625
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,234
[birds chirping]

626
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,431
I should have known
you'd come.

627
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,759
Yeah, you should've.

628
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,115
(Jesse)
I told you he was too ornery.

629
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,270
Jesse!

630
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,874
[Jesse laughing]

631
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,555
Oh, God, we thought
they'd killed you.

632
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,077
If you ain't learnt by now,
the Travens are a hard kill.

633
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,759
I, uh, got somethin' here
that belongs to you.

634
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,639
Thank you, Kate.

635
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,115
Hello, Mac.

636
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,520
Hello, Kate.

637
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,952
Hey, how do you like
what I picked up
on the trail?

638
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,632
What about Heather and Sissy?

639
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,757
They sailed this morning
for Mexico.

640
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,320
Why didn't
they take you along?

641
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,437
They thought I'd be trouble.

642
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,558
I can appreciate that.

643
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,879
What about Ashbury?

644
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,633
He sailed with them.

645
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,031
It's a hard ride
between here and Chihuahua.

646
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,112
And them travellin' by ship.

647
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,432
I don't know nothin'
about Mexico.

648
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,520
Dal?

649
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,995
Not much.

650
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,916
Jesse?

651
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,958
I know someone who does.

652
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,714
Jack Traven.

653
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,591
You are talkin' about
Uncle "Black Jack" Traven?

654
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,875
Yes, sir.

655
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,400
Well, big brother,

656
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,871
you know there are some people
who call him "scoundrel."

657
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,636
Some might even call him
"outlaw."

658
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,474
And we all know he's a rogue.

659
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,155
Besides, we don't know
where to find him.

660
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,959
Converse County Jail.

661
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,712
What are we waitin' for?

662
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,190
[sawing]

663
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,759
Never seen old Uncle Jack
raise a sweat before.

664
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,114
[birds chirping]

665
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,719
[chuckling]
Well,

666
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,551
good to see you boys
made it through the war
all right.

667
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,554
Well, quit gawkin'.
It's humiliatin' enough
without you laughin' on it.

668
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,793
Aw, come on, Uncle Jack,
you've been in jail before.

669
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,439
Well, I don't care about that.

670
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,637
It's the workin'
I'm talkin' about.

671
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,111
A lot of men have seen me
raise a lot of hell
in my time,

672
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,637
but not one man alive
has ever seen me
raise a blister.

673
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,997
Well, don't fret
about it, Jack.

674
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,878
We're not gonna tell nobody.

675
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,917
What did they
lock you up for?

676
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,391
Oh, they're just tryin'
to make somethin'
out of nothin'.

677
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,632
I met this gal
over in Big Springs,

678
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,030
and it turned out
she was married.

679
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,477
You're in here
'cause of that?

680
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,836
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that, but...

681
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,556
How'd you boys know
where to find me?

682
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,074
Miles Gillette.

683
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,279
Miles Gillette, huh?

684
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,755
Oh, Mac, I sure hope
you're still figurin'
on runnin' against him.

685
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,556
I'll swear that man's
been after my hide

686
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,916
for 30 years,
and he won't let up.

687
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,117
What did you ever do to him?

688
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,994
Nothin' serious.

689
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,478
I mean,
a man can't even bend the law
a little bit anymore.

690
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,951
Now, last time
you were in jail,
it was over a woman, too.

691
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,958
Judge's wife, I recall.

692
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,432
And there was shootin'.

693
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,234
Self defence.

694
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,275
Ain't you gettin'
a little old for that?

695
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,114
Uh, you mean gunplay?

696
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,634
No, I mean the other.

697
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,077
When I get too old for that,
they'll be shovellin' dirt
in my face.

698
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,720
How about this last woman?
Any shootin'?

699
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,038
No serious shootin'.

700
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,396
We just dropped by
to say hello.

701
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,869
Well, thanks.

702
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,156
Mac, we need him.

703
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,594
You heard what he said.

704
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,353
Yep, except we need him.

705
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,999
Well, that's fine.

706
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,312
Except,
how we gonna get him out?
I mean, it's a jail.

707
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,834
Got any ideas?

708
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,750
Yeah.

709
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,399
[crickets chirping]

710
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,278
(Jesse)
Come on, Uncle Jack,
we gotta get out of here.

711
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,880
[Jack coughing]

712
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,359
Come on, Uncle Jack.

713
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,553
Well, did you have to use
two sticks of dynamite?

714
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,839
[horse neighing]

715
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,909
Hello, Kate.

716
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,320
Hello, Jack.

717
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,310
Brought your horse.

718
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,550
Oh, thank you.

719
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,915
Glad to see
you're still alive.

720
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,195
Well, thank you.

721
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,034
Take a look at these wrinkles
and these here grey hairs.

722
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,349
Every one of 'em earned.

723
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,760
[chuckling]

724
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,594
[clicking tongue]

725
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,478
Well, I sure do appreciate
you boys bustin' me out.

726
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,155
I hope nobody back there
got a good look.

727
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,995
I gotta be loco.
Blowin' up a jail!

728
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,270
(Jack)
By the way, where we bound?

729
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,910
Mexico.

730
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,114
You do know
the country down there,
don't you?

731
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,475
I know more
about that country

732
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,438
than a jackrabbit
knows about runnin'.

733
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,479
Every trail,
back trail, cantinas,

734
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,714
bawdyhouses.

735
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,474
We're not exactly
goin' down there
sightseein', Jack.

736
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,755
We ain't?

737
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,520
Then why?

738
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,399
(Jesse)
Mac, Dal, better get up here!

739
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,519
Right out there.

740
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,553
(Jack)
Who the hell are they?

741
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,836
I'd say
that's gotta be a posse.

742
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,153
Looks like
they're in a hurry.

743
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,960
Uncle Jack,
have you been
tellin' us everything?

744
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,269
What do you mean?

745
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,751
I mean,
by the way they're ridin',
you left out somethin'.

746
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,478
Yeah, it might be that fella
I shot over in Waco.

747
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,957
You mean you killed someone?

748
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,554
(Jack)
No, it's worse.

749
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,758
His father was the mayor.

750
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,115
I don't want to hear anymore.

751
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,874
If they catch up to us,
my chances of
runnin' for office are dead.

752
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,553
You hear me? Dead!

753
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,637
You could always start over.

754
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,630
That's Miles Gillette
leadin' 'em.

755
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,440
What's he doin' along?

756
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,512
Maybe he heard you're fixin'
to run for sheriff.

757
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,354
Why is the Sheriff
of Big Springs
chasin' after you

758
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,079
for somethin'
you did in Waco?

759
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,152
Well, Mac, you know
how that old turkey's

760
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,152
had it in for me
all these years.

761
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,914
If you keep jawin',
they're gonna catch up to us.

762
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,879
No, because in a few hours
we'll be at the Rio Grande.

763
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,395
When we cross that,
we'll be in Mexico.

764
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,630
Come on.

765
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,634
It's your men?

766
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,112
My welcoming committee.

767
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,431
I don't see any sign
of the rifles.

768
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,795
We have a system here.

769
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,473
You see those wagons?

770
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:22,156
They're to transport
the grain and the prisoners
to the train.

771
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,276
Train?

772
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,477
The train that will take us
to Chihuahua.

773
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,438
Your rifles
are on that train.

774
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,670
How far?

775
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,757
Half a day's journey
from here.

776
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,150
(man)
Hey, Carlos,

777
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,277
what do you think of
this pretty blonde girl here?

778
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,874
[man exclaiming]

779
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,679
[people chattering]

780
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,394
[men grunting]

781
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,719
[birds chirping]

782
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,033
[insects chittering]

783
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,834
Where is Jack?

784
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,397
He was supposed
to be keepin' watch,
but he disappeared.

785
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,709
(Dal)
Where's Mac?

786
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,598
Lookin' for Uncle Jack.

787
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,790
[sighs]

788
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,557
Here, I brought you
a little drink.

789
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,676
Where you been?

790
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,920
There's a village back there,

791
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,161
and you know
they got some girls there
that would just--

792
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,709
That posse's in sight.
Best get goin'.

793
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,598
You still haven't told us
why that posse
isn't lettin' up.

794
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,034
Well, it must be
that other thing.

795
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,120
What thing?

796
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,520
Well, it wasn't my fault.

797
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,319
I was just drinkin'
a lot of whiskey and--

798
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,359
Whiskey gets the blame
for a lot of things
it didn't do. Come on.

799
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,557
(Jack)
Hold on to that tequila.

800
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,034
[men grunting]

801
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,394
[man laughing]

802
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,953
[people chattering]

803
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,995
[exclaims]

804
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,673
[woman chattering]

805
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,233
Unload everything.

806
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,595
(Hammond)
Put them all in the stockade!

807
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,478
And I mean all of 'em.

808
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,713
[girls screaming]

809
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,280
(girl)
No, no!

810
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,315
All right, get down. Move!

811
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,834
[men clamouring]

812
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,759
[girls screaming]

813
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,557
[men chattering in Spanish]

814
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,034
[girls crying]

815
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,233
[horses approaching]

816
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,514
No sign of 'em.

817
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,636
Good.

818
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,799
I best get back up there
and keep a lookout.

819
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,600
(Mac)
Good thing they let up.
Horses need a rest.

820
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,718
(Dal)
Yeah, could be
they're doin' the same thing.

821
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,953
How you makin' out?

822
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,474
I'm doin' fine.

823
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,596
[sighs]

824
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,474
Kind of warm.

825
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,635
Hey, Kate.

826
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,274
How did you manage
to get so friendly
with Frank King?

827
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,760
What do you mean?

828
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,194
The two of you're engaged.

829
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,919
I'd say that's gettin'
pretty friendly.

830
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,514
I heard you were killed.

831
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,398
What was I supposed to do?

832
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,631
You always said
you'd wait for me.

833
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,756
Wait?

834
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,436
I waited for you
most of my life.

835
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,000
Like I said,
I heard you were dead.

836
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,673
Well, I ain't dead.

837
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,752
I never got word otherwise.

838
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,351
Same as when you left,
not a word.

839
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,352
There was a war goin' on.

840
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,359
You know,
sometimes a man's gotta do--

841
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,511
What he has to do.
Well, sometimes
a woman does, too

842
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,240
and I'm a woman,
Dal Traven, not a martyr.

843
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,958
I just thought
you always knew
I'd be comin' back.

844
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,712
How was I supposed to know?

845
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,996
I thought that's the way
it was meant to be.

846
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,434
You thought?

847
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,352
Why didn't you ever ask me?

848
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,834
Ask you? Ask you what?

849
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,791
Oh, why didn't you ever ask me
what Frank King asked me?

850
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,110
[crying]

851
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,557
Hey, Dal,
while you're down there

852
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,791
tryin' to figure out
the female race,

853
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,951
you might as well
take a bath.

854
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,598
Those two gotta be loco.

855
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,837
I think they call that love,
little brother.

856
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,877
Amounts to the same thing,
don't it?

857
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,679
How's your love life?

858
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,760
[exclaims]

859
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,950
Not me.

860
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,476
Since I've been home,

861
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,075
I spend my time with the folks
helpin' with the ranch.

862
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,072
What about your schoolin'?

863
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,758
I figured
I'd pick that up again
when we get back.

864
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,912
Well, that's good to hear.

865
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,632
We Travens
got a lot of faults,

866
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,155
but bein' ignorant
ain't one of them.

867
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,711
Especially
havin' a big brother aimin'
to run for governor.

868
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,960
No. That just sounds good
to the ladies.

869
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,315
[laughing]

870
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,873
You sure did leave
an awful big footprint, Mac.

871
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,750
Listen,

872
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,114
you just be yourself, Jesse.

873
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,715
So far, I'd say
you're doin' just fine.

874
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,397
I just realized
Holiday Hammond's hangout's

875
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,073
over that next ridge.

876
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,994
I know those boys up there,
and I can ride in.

877
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,954
But they'll
probably shoot you.

878
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,430
You mean, there's nobody else
they'd let pass through there

879
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,512
besides thieves and killers?

880
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,640
Oh, no offence.

881
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,520
Do you mind tellin' me
how you're gonna get
the rest of us in there

882
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,399
without us endin' up
in a funeral procession?

883
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,991
Well, there's a mission
over here a little ways.

884
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,630
I figured I'd ride over there
and say a prayer for you boys.

885
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,194
What'd he say?

886
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,551
Said he was gonna
take up prayin'.

887
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,313
You best go with him.

888
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,600
Amen.

889
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,233
Hey, where'd you get that?

890
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,720
I borrowed them.

891
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,995
You mean stole.

892
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,151
They don't sell 'em,
you know.

893
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,517
You gonna borrow him, too?

894
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,031
Here, you best take these

895
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,554
and we best quit jawin'
and get out of here.

896
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,000
[both laughing]

897
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,112
[woman speaking Spanish]

898
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,873
[Hammond chattering]

899
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,631
Colonel, I would like
to see those guns now.

900
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,159
Why, what's your hurry?
Enjoy the festivities.

901
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,551
I have kept my end
of the bargain.

902
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,994
<i>Mañana, mañana.</i>

903
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,640
Now! I want to see them now!

904
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,360
[gun clicking]

905
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,039
The Major said now.

906
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,760
Right now?

907
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,075
Right now.

908
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,358
You have been double-dealin'
from the start, Colonel.

909
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,120
That's right, Major.

910
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,476
But, you see,
that's the risks you take

911
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,870
when you deal
with the likes of me.

912
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,314
Lock him up.

913
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,437
What the hell's
goin' on here?

914
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:26,309
Kate's goin' in there
and lend a little comfort
to the prisoners.

915
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,715
Prisoners?

916
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,477
You mean
you want to send her
in there alone?

917
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,677
Well, it's gonna take
at least three of us, Dal.

918
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,275
That's the only way
I know how to get us in.

919
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,113
Why does it have to be Kate?

920
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,079
Well, you'd look
pretty foolish in this getup.

921
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,435
Dal, don't forget
Ashbury's in there.

922
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,671
Now, he knows you
and he knows Jesse.

923
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,717
Now I figure Uncle Jack
knows what he's sayin'.

924
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,234
It's gonna take
three of us inside.

925
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,437
That leaves me,
Jack, and Kate.

926
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,349
Well, Ashbury knows Kate,
too, you know.

927
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,477
Not in that outfit he don't.

928
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,558
I don't want her
goin' in there.

929
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,359
Well, what about what I want?

930
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,239
I've been with this thing
a lot longer than you have.

931
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,993
Heather and Sissy
are in there.

932
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,719
How else
are we gonna get them out?

933
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,473
We'll find another way.

934
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:10,789
Come on, Dal.

935
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,475
What do you say
let's take a little ride?

936
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:32,314
Jesse, why don't you
go take that Sharp's
off my horse?

937
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,757
The way this is goin',
you're gonna need it
more than me.

938
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,554
[donkey braying]

939
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,312
Don't go hard on him, Kate.

940
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,558
I'm afraid he inherited
that ornery streak from Pa.

941
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,514
I never seen your pa
ride hard on your ma.

942
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,640
Oh, he tries.

943
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,960
He tries, but she
just fights right back.

944
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,079
Just like you do.

945
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,231
They ended up havin'
a pretty good thing.

946
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,834
That's all I want.

947
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,754
Well, if you can tolerate him,
you'll have it.

948
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,994
Kate, he needs you,
you know that.

949
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,996
You're right, he does need me,
but he doesn't know it.

950
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,714
I think he does.

951
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,599
Hell, you know him
as well as I do. He cares.

952
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,876
I think he cares a lot,
he just...

953
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,031
He--he don't know
how to say it.

954
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,077
Well, isn't it about time
he learnt?

955
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,038
Well, it's not his way,

956
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,432
but I'll tell you somethin',

957
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,797
I'd be willin' to bet,
you stick with him,
he'll learn.

958
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,914
What about you?

959
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,070
Kate,

960
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,559
you sure
you're gonna be all right
goin' in there alone?

961
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,835
Don't worry, Mac.

962
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,038
Even if they find me out,
they probably won't hurt me.

963
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,794
You didn't
answer my question.
What about you?

964
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,554
Goin' in there alone,
I mean, that's risky.

965
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,000
You always do that.

966
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,080
What?

967
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,589
Change the subject
when things get too close.

968
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,680
Oh.

969
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,720
[snickers]

970
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,520
You think
you got me figured out,
don't you?

971
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,000
Well, that's not
gonna work, see,

972
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,391
because
I'm not talkin' about me,
I'm talkin' about Dal.

973
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,400
Now, I think he's actin'
the way he is--

974
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,676
What is it
with you Traven boys?

975
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,120
Oh.

976
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,513
I got the feelin'
you're fixin'
to make a point.

977
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,994
Dal can't say how he feels
about a woman,
and you run from it.

978
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,594
I'm not runnin'.

979
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,832
I mean, Kate,
you know how it is.
You know...

980
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,638
Well, I am runnin',
I'm--I'm runnin' for sheriff.

981
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,278
There is no room
in my life right now
for a woman.

982
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,952
The trouble with you,
Mac Traven,
is you're gun-shy.

983
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,675
Well, let me put it this way.

984
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,071
Somebody like you comes along,

985
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,913
I might consider it.

986
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,874
Now cool down.

987
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,955
[chuckles]

988
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,394
[birds chirping]

989
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,835
It's like
a damn hornet's nest
down there.

990
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,951
If you got a plan, Jack,
you better be
lettin' me in on it.

991
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,831
You know,
you never asked me
how I got this tequila.

992
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,356
How?

993
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,389
Stole it.

994
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,919
Just like I did this.

995
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,720
I got a plan.

996
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,840
Quit worryin' about
that woman, will you?

997
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,640
She's a tough one, and smart.
You know that.

998
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,518
And when the shootin' starts,

999
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,195
she'll be there
to look after the girls.

1000
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,519
We'll take care of her, Dal.
That's a promise.

1001
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,872
I'm gonna hold you to it.

1002
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,880
[hens clucking]

1003
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,674
You looking for someone?

1004
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,070
I heard at the mission
some women were brought in.

1005
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,753
I'd like to see them.

1006
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,071
This is not
a good place for you.

1007
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,992
Take me to them, please.

1008
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:19,955
Then come.

1009
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,720
How you boys doin'?

1010
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,393
Haven't seen you
for a while.

1011
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,279
Figured either
a lawman or a husband
finally got you.

1012
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,716
There's a few of them
chasin' me, I guess.

1013
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,916
Who's he?

1014
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,593
This is my nephew.

1015
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,953
(man)
Go on through.

1016
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,439
That wasn't too hard.

1017
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,355
Sister, will you pray for me?

1018
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,679
Of course, my child.

1019
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,834
[men chattering]

1020
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,119
I'm Sister Katherine.

1021
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,595
Uncle Jack,

1022
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:04,754
now I know you got a plan,
but don't you think
you ought to fill me in?

1023
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,957
Here, you might need this.

1024
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,640
Kate!

1025
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,836
[shushing]

1026
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,754
Mac is here.
So's Jesse and Dal.

1027
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,595
You mean they're alive?

1028
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,273
They're goin' to get you
out of here.

1029
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,874
[chain rattling]

1030
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,039
You're intruding, sir.

1031
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,634
I'm sorry, Sister.

1032
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:58,953
But I couldn't help noticing,
despite the habit,
that you're quite young.

1033
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,919
And now
I can't help wondering

1034
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,957
what you'd look like
without that outfit.

1035
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,839
I am a nun.
Have you no conscience?

1036
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,756
Not when
there's a profit in it.

1037
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,195
[screams]

1038
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,399
Hello, Kate.
Welcome to Mexico.

1039
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,274
[all laughing]

1040
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,274
You all know what
the old maid said
to the cowpuncher, don't you?

1041
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,360
(man)
No.

1042
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,312
You tell 'em, Uncle Jack.

1043
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,440
Come on, <i>amigos.</i>

1044
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,352
It's been a long,
hard trail, and I'm buyin'.

1045
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,874
[all cheering]

1046
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,595
[men shouting]

1047
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:42,752
Damn, it won't take forever
for that posse to get here.

1048
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,559
What're they waitin' on?

1049
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,518
Jack said to wait
for his signal.

1050
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,920
What signal?

1051
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,912

[horses neighing]

1056
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,751
I reckon
that's Uncle Jack's signal.

1057
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,433
I'll take
the one on the left.

1058
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,715
Got you.

Find the girls.

On the train.

1080
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,119

Get back.

Where's Kate and the girls?

1086
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,117
By God, I ought to kill you

1087
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,431
for what you done
to my family.

1088
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,400
Then do it.

1089
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,550
This killin's
got to stop somewhere.

1090
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,911
I recall this belongs to you.

1091
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,479
Makes us even, Major.

1092
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:48,832

We'll be getting
into Chihuahua tonight.

1104
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,917
Perhaps the day after
you'd care to go on
into Mexico City.

1105
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,674
Colonel Hammond,

1106
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,039
are you going
to keep the brandy
all to yourself?

1107
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,194
Why, no.
No, not at all.

1108
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,794

Stop this train.

You best
get out of the way.

1132
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:27,274
Sorry, Sheriff,
can't do that.
We want Jack.

1133
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:30,475
Now, I know why
you boys come down here.

1134
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,711
I'm sorry for what happened
to your family,

1135
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,439
but I got a job to do.

1136
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,716

is goin' back to Texas.

We're all goin' back to Texas.

Uncle Jack's ridin' with us.

1139
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:43,116
You boys
busted your Uncle Jack
out of jail.

1140
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,157
Now, I'm willin'
to let that slide.

1141
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,516
You ain't got
no authority down here.

1142
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,273
What'd he do anyway?

1143
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,800
What'd he do?

1144
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:55,314
This man's a horse thief,
a renegade,

01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,360
a double-dealin',
lyin', womanizin'--

1146
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,671
Womanizin'
ain't against the law.

1147
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,280
Go on, tell 'em, Gillette,

1148
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,159
how you been
settin' on your rump
for all these years,

1149
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,799
all of a sudden
you start chasin' me

1150
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,792
till I about
turned into raw meat.

1151
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,190
You just been
runnin' loose too long.

1152
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,795
There's more to it than that.
You tell them, or I will.

1153
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,031
I'll carve
your tongue out, Jack.

1154
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,032
You better tell us, Miles.

1155
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,358
He's been after my wife.

That ain't all of it.

1159
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:33,199
That wife of yours
has been chasin' me
for years,

1160
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,796
and I just got
tired of runnin'.

1161
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,472
I--I caught 'em together.

1162
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,438
And I'm takin' him in.

1163
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,594
You take one Traven,
you gotta take 'em all.

1164
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,191
Sorry it had to come to this.

1165
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,352
Maybe it doesn't have to.

1166
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,752
Make you a trade, Sheriff.

1167
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,400
Holiday Hammond
for "Black Jack" Traven.

1168
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,519
Hammond's a big fish
compared to Uncle Jack.

1169
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,630
Mean a lot more to you fellas
ridin' back into Texas

1170
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,757
with Holiday Hammond in tow.

1171
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,196
Been on the wanted list
almost 20 years.

1172
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:13,398
(Jesse)
Most wanted man in Texas,
the way I hear it.

1173
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,831
You boys got yourself
a trade.

1174
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,879
You'd have loved Mexico City.

1175
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,634
Maybe, but you'd
never have seen it alive.

1176
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,590
Kate, I might have died
a happy man.

1177
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,119
Jack Traven, I don't want

1178
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,351
to ever see you
around Big Springs again.

1179
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:46,000
Afraid you got no say
in the matter, Gillette.

1180
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,595
See, I'm gonna be
the next sheriff
of Big Springs.

1181
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,399
See you at the polls.

1182
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,437
Give my regards to your wife.

[Jack laughing]

1184
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,231
Jack Traven
for Holiday Hammond.

1185
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,439
You boys sure did get
the best of that trade.

1186
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,512
That's a matter of opinion.

1187
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,399
Upsy-daisy.
Sorry.

1188
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,160
[both laughing]

1189
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,719
Got room for one more?

1190
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:02,759
You mean
you're tradin' in your horse
for a wagon ride?

1191
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:06,356
Yeah, well, I got somethin'
I want to ask you.

1192
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,033
[Heather giggling]

1193
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,914
Let's go home.

1194
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,795
Giddyap!
