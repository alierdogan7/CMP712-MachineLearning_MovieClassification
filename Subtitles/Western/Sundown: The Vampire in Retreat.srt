1
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,374
Gwendolyn, stop terrorizing your sister.

2
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,035
Dad, we were just playing.

3
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,807
Playing? Look at poor Julia.

4
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,210
She won't even sleep with the lights out.

5
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,749
Darling, stop being such a tyrant.

6
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,716
They're just having a little childhood fun.

7
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,083
Yeah, Dad. Childhood fun.

8
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,452
Anyhow, it's not me

9
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,117
who has horror pictures all over my room.

10
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,195
Is it?

11
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,793
Gwen is right.

12
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,528
It's just a passing phase.

13
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,628
Barbie and hula hoops
are a passing phase.

14
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,333
And what makes it worse
is that you encourage this.

15
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,500
Well, I...

16
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,009
She didn't buy these things herself.

17
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,011
No. But lately, when we go shopping,

18
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,276
it's all she seems to want.

19
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:33,011
Well, maybe this trip to Purgatory
will do her some good.

20
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,349
She'll meet some nice, average,

21
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,820
everyday, normal people.

22
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,711
I got a dollar says that's him.

23
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,717
Yeah.

24
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,696
If that's the guy that's gonna
save Purgatory, we're in big trouble.

25
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,153
Hey!

26
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,228
You pensioners work here?

27
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,694
Full serve.

28
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,459
That's one of your dumber ideas, Merle.

29
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,056
Self-serve, that's the way.

30
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,006
Whoever he is,
one of us best take care of him.

31
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,335
Well, I went out yesterday.

32
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,137
And me the day before.

33
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,338
Well, damn it.

34
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,418
Let me go get some sunblock.

35
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,282
Be right with ya, young fella!

36
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,787
Young dipshit.

37
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,618
About time.

38
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,057
I was beginning to think you guys had died.

39
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,487
Hey! Where the fuck you goin'?

40
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,650
You guys gonna sell me some gas or what?

41
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,885
Sometimes I miss the old days.

42
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,518
It's hardest on Mort, of course.

43
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,960
That temper of his.

44
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,103
What is the big deal?

45
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,807
Get the lead out of your ass
and sell me some gas!

46
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,146
Boy, I hope that isn't him.

47
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,733
I'm not so sure Mort is the right one
to wait on this guy.

48
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,601
Might work out.

49
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,335
Might put us in deep shit with Mardulak.

50
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,568
How much you want, son?

51
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,510
You can fill it up, Gramps.

52
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:49,979
I've been waiting half my life

53
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,347
for you fossils to figure it out.

54
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,612
Everything moves a little slower

55
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,587
at my age, young fella.

56
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,214
Now you just...

57
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,350
Just relax,

58
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,191
and I'll get your gas for you.

59
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,857
Mort's doing okay, eh?

60
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,194
Can't last.

61
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,531
Hey, Gramps.

62
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,103
What's with the sun bonnet?

63
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,002
You can't take the sun?

64
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,335
Now ain't that something!

65
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,940
Old fart can't take the sun
and he lives in the damn desert!

66
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,713
Your name wouldn't be
David Harrison, would it?

67
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,310
Tom Pryor.

68
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,322
The name on the road to fame.

69
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,483
Ain't that a shame.

70
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,798
Looks like Mort struck oil.

71
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,232
Now look what you've gone and done!

72
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,636
I'm sorry, but he got me pissed!

73
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,972
That's gonna put our butts in the sun.

74
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,546
I better go down to the plant
and tell Jefferson.

75
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,137
You two hide the body.

76
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,513
Anybody sees it, we're spiked for sure.

77
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,676
I don't believe this.

78
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,186
- What?
- They've knocked his...

79
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,518
- Oh, no.
- Give 'em here!

80
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,615
Oh, no.

81
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,353
Oh, no.

82
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,361
They... No. No.

83
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,637
False alarm!

84
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,802
Never mind, folks! False alarm!

85
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,278
Forget it. Never mind.

86
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,246
False alarm, Otto!

87
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,943
You folks, never mind.

88
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,986
Never mind, Sandy.

89
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,183
Never mind.

90
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,000
Let's turn it up!

91
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,162
I hope this works, Pierre.

92
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,673
Are you sure?

93
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,675
Yes! Yes! Up!

94
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,836
Here it goes.

95
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,759
So, what now?

96
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,901
Relax, boys.

97
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,843
Dave Harrison's on his way.

98
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,250
Sarah, I really do appreciate

99
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,445
you taking time off your studies.

100
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,317
Mardulak paid me a hell
of a lot for that patent.

101
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,720
The least I can do is make sure
it works for the guy.

102
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,293
We're family.
One goes, we all go.

103
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,361
- Right?
- Right.

104
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,158
You know, David, there is one thing

105
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,462
I really do dread about
these next two weeks, though.

106
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,332
Meeting that bastard Shane again.

107
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,904
Hey.

108
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,530
You were the one who dated him.

109
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,575
Well, we didn't exactly date.

110
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,270
Oh, I know. You two were
the legend of Twain Hall.

111
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,511
You know, the last time I saw him,

112
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,845
he swore that he would get you back,
no matter what it took.

113
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,612
- That was the day that...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

114
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,553
The day he beat the shit out of me.
But at least I got the first punch in.

115
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,591
Yeah. You weren't in the hospital very long.

116
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,226
Where is this place?

117
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,489
I don't know.

118
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,087
Around this corner, I think.

119
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,740
You sure we can't take
this up with Mardulak?

120
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,469
No!

121
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,636
He told me himself.

122
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,407
Disciplinary problems go to Mr. Jefferson.

123
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,109
You said you had a disciplinary problem.

124
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,208
You go to Mr. Jefferson.

125
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,816
Lucky me.

126
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,387
Yes?

127
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,697
Mr. Jefferson will see you now.

128
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,446
So?

129
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,676
Well, the good news is
it wasn't Dave Harrison.

130
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,946
From the beginning, Merle.

131
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,647
From the beginning.

132
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,220
I can't believe this.

133
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,387
I just can't believe this.

134
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,955
No one is gonna believe us!
I wouldn't believe us!

135
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,900
Who is gonna believe that
some relic with a sombrero

136
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,973
knocked off Tom's head
with a backhand?

137
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,974
We know that they hid
Tom's jeep in the garage.

138
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,011
With his headless body!

139
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,011
Yeah.

140
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,138
And that's gotta be enough

141
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,445
to get a cop to believe
that something happened.

142
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,712
Shit, Jack.

143
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,515
What kind of monsters are these?

144
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,352
This stuff is worse than a chorizo, man.

145
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,018
Pigs, pigs, pigs!

146
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,824
I have come to retire among swine.

147
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,225
How can you drink that stuff cold, James?

148
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,327
It's not even the right color.

149
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,201
What's the color got to do with it?

150
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,365
It tastes real.

151
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,033
A typically English comment.

152
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,772
If this Dave Harrison
can't step up production,

153
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,041
then it won't matter, anyhow.

154
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,845
It will be back to the old ways
for all of us.

155
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,086
Yeah.

156
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,155
That would be a damn shame.

157
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,793
This the road to Purgatory?

158
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,871
Would you be David Harrison?

159
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,131
Yes.

160
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,232
That way.

161
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,605
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

162
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,044
Bye! Bye!

163
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:00,110
We must hide the body... and the car.

164
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,550
We thought of that.

165
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,122
Mort and Milt are taking care
of that right now.

166
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,783
A pity that foresight
is so infrequently available

167
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,087
to the Bisby brothers.

168
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,184
What about Mort?

169
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:14,096
As this act is that of simple murder,
not a reversion,

170
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,293
Mardulak may look more kindly upon it.

171
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,997
In the meantime, I'm gonna have
the sheriff take Mort to jail.

172
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,097
To jail?

173
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,334
What jail can hold him?

174
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,273
It won't be the bars that will restrain

175
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,504
your hot-headed brother.

176
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,012
It'll be the fear for his life.

177
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,242
Do I make myself clear?

178
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,477
As clear as a spring in Maine.

179
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,985
Thank you.

180
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,247
You may go.

181
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,345
You must be the Harrisons.

182
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,916
Did we leave our name tags on?

183
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,282
No need for name tags
in a town this size, man.

184
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,788
Everybody knows this is the day
that David Harrison arrives.

185
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,451
You're famous, man.
A celebrity.

186
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,858
A big fish in a dry pond.

187
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,827
This is my wife, Sarah,

188
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,523
and my daughters, Gwendolyn and...

189
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,965
- Juliet.
- Juliet.

190
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,558
I'm Quinton Canada,

191
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,865
the only policeman in Purgatory.

192
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,872
Easiest job in town, man.

193
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,705
No drunks, no tourists, no crime.

194
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,906
- Nice to meet you.
- A pleasure to have met you.

195
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,209
Thank you.

196
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,080
Nice guy.

197
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,620
But what's with the hats?

198
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,683
My darling.

199
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,167
<i>Anna? It's them, the Harrisons, ja?</i>

200
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,500
Everybody knows us?

201
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,164
Celebrities, man.

202
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:08,170
Anna and Otto Trotsberg,

203
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,805
shopkeepers at your service.

204
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,577
Mardulak told us you come today.

205
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,777
We should treat you good.

206
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,114
Regular VIPs.

207
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,348
<i>But we don't know their kinderl</i>

208
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,582
<i>Come, liebchin.</i>

209
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,750
Come see Auntie Anna.

210
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,059
And what is your name, child?

211
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,132
Juliet Harrison.

212
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,258
And that's my sister, Gwendolyn.

213
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,064
Juliet and Gwendolyn.

214
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,435
Do you hear that, Otto?

215
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,235
Such names!

216
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,436
Your parents must be very romantic.

217
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,536
They're very horny.

218
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,615
Gwen!

219
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,947
To be young and alive, eh, Otto?

220
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,489
And you have such beautiful children.

221
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,253
You see, Anna and I outlived our children.

222
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,921
There's no greater sadness than...

223
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,019
Shush, Otto.

224
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,567
That was a long time ago.

225
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,067
How can we help you?

226
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,535
We could use some supplies.

227
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,107
- How about spaghetti tonight, kids?
- Yay!

228
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,403
Sounds good. Do you want
to help me find the tomato sauce?

229
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,035
- Come on, girls.
- Help yourselves.

230
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,670
We could also use some directions.

231
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,339
We're staying up at the Reilly Mansions.

232
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,818
Oh. The old copper barons' homes.

233
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,855
<i>Ja. It's just down the road,
across the bridge.</i>

234
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:24,980
Copper barons?

235
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,423
You know, for years,
this little town was booming!

236
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,495
A lot of jobs. Lot of money.

237
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,724
The copper market collapses
and so does Purgatory.

238
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,060
Everybody leaves.

239
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,260
It's a town for ghosts.

240
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,395
And then, Jozek Mardulak,

241
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,564
he bought the whole town.

242
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,301
Lock, stock, and barrel.

243
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:47,243
- Now it's a town for...
- Otto.

244
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,246
Blood-makers, Anna.

245
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,713
Blood-makers.

246
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,650
Thanks to you, Dave Harrison.

247
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,813
Well, don't thank me yet.

248
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,154
There are a lot of needy people in this world
that could use that blood substitute.

249
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,228
And if I get the production going faster,

250
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,854
then you'll have that boom town again.

251
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,489
Excuse me.
Do you have any garlic?

252
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,260
Garlic?

253
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,858
Where?

254
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,063
Do we have any?

255
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,738
Garlic? No.

256
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,814
No! Never!

257
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,849
Was it something I said?

258
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,077
I don't... Well, they were friendly.

259
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,552
- Neat store!
- Did you get directions to the house?

260
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,553
Yeah. It's a breeze.

261
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,055
It's up there, past the bridge.

262
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,681
Okay, you can go with the groceries.

263
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,369
Two more. Those damn Bisbys.

264
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,770
I didn't hear any alarm.

265
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,205
This time, we're closed.

266
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,608
I'll phone the cafe and tell Sandy.

267
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,744
- It's late.
- I'm cold.

268
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,116
There's gotta be a police station
around here somewhere.

269
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,557
That's it!

270
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,188
I can't bear to look
at that hamburger another minute!

271
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,358
Food. Shit.
How'd I ever eat it?

272
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,733
Oh, you poor mofos!

273
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,362
All you gotta do is look at it.

274
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,134
I gotta cook it!

275
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,334
Hello?

276
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,468
Well, thanks.

277
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,704
Bye, Anna.

278
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,276
More people are coming into town.

279
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,215
Let's keep up appearances.

280
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,616
Bailey, sit back down.

281
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,122
We can't fool everyone forever.

282
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,420
Mardulak's gotta know that.

283
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,069
They look so...

284
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,365
so hungry.

285
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,379
Hey! Hey!

286
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,214
It's him! They caught him!

287
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,850
We saw it all, Officer!

288
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,424
This guy killed our friend!

289
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,524
That so, Mort?

290
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,824
You killed their friend?

291
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,264
I'm afraid so, Mr. Quinton.

292
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,925
I lost my head.

293
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,001
Hey, he's not in handcuffs.

294
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,235
Hey, man, what's going on?

295
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,605
Why isn't he in handcuffs?

296
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,406
That wouldn't do any good, man.

297
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,276
No good at all.

298
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,850
Okay. Got to lock you away.

299
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,012
Can't have a threat
to the population like yourself,

300
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,714
walkin' around the neighborhood.

301
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:50,695
So, you saw Mr. Bisby's
temper tantrum, eh?

302
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,127
Temper tantrum?

303
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,029
Yeah, Mort's always had a short fuse.

304
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,830
- Short fuse?
- He murdered our friend!

305
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,460
He was an asshole!

306
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,165
Who else knows you've come to Purgatory?

307
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,242
What kind of question is that?

308
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,038
You haven't even asked what I saw yet!

309
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,807
I know exactly what you saw.

310
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,812
You do?

311
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,785
Well, good.

312
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,119
Good. Then we can go ahead
and leave town, right?

313
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,555
We can just go.

314
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,251
Not exactly.

315
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,760
The hell we can't.

316
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,762
We're gettin' out of here.

317
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,990
In the cell, please.

318
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,534
We haven't done anything!

319
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,866
Now don't make me use force.

320
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,618
- Okay.
- All right, who wants to be strong

321
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,281
- and carry the groceries?
- Me! Me! Me!

322
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,819
Not too bad for a two-week vacation.

323
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,627
- I wonder who got the big one?
- Yeah, I wonder.

324
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:04,361
- But ours isn't too bad.
- I wanna carry the bicycle.

325
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,629
Okay. Come on.

326
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,829
Okay. How about I take the heavy stuff?

327
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,841
- Good idea.
- All right.

328
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,843
Oh, gosh.

329
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,113
Well, it looks somewhat livable.

330
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,349
- Yeah, if you're a spider.
- Wow, Mommy, spider webs!

331
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,472
Damn it!

332
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:06,823
We strike tomorrow.

333
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,162
Everything is ready.

334
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,236
I hear the Harrisons have arrived.

335
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,928
I timed it perfectly.

336
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,030
Just don't let your lust
interfere with my plan.

337
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,132
It won't. I've waited this long.

338
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,711
I can wait one more night.

339
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,109
Where do you think you're going?

340
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,943
Just to pay a visit.

341
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,414
Naked?

342
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,348
All right, girls.
Time to go to bed now.

343
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:31,115
No! Mom! Mom!

344
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,953
- Mom!
- Mom!

345
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,318
Good night, girls.

346
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,556
Now I don't want to hear another sound.

347
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,311
Coming to bed?

348
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:55,880
You remember.

349
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,381
Four legs, springy mattress.

350
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,179
Oh, yeah.

351
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,480
Big day tomorrow.

352
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,647
Yeah? Well, it could be
your big night, tonight.

353
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,248
Mansion, candle light,

354
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,521
<i>Wuthering Heights all over again.</i>

355
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,221
I'll be up as soon as I'm finished.

356
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,355
You promise?

357
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:14,727
Threat.

358
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,790
Oh, David.

359
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,455
You don't know what you're missing.

360
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:42,175
David! David!

361
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,241
Mommy!

362
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,880
Okay, okay. Okay!

363
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,118
Come on. It's okay.

364
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,421
It's all right. It's all right.

365
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:26,088
Honey, I'm finished.

366
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,756
It's okay. I don't know.

367
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,026
It was a bird or something.

368
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,125
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

369
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,864
Have the girls been fighting again?

370
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,180
This hick town sucks!

371
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,580
There's one hip club in town

372
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,949
and there's, like, this line!

373
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,383
Let's blow.

374
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,154
Let's go back to L.A.!

375
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,595
Right. Where your old man'll kill ya,

376
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,564
and mine will put me in a convent.

377
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,158
These people are gross.

378
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,068
That local geek Jeff's having
a party at his parents' house.

379
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,334
Supposed to have real ludes.

380
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,966
714s!

381
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,476
Dude.

382
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,012
Hey, you know what's supposed
to be fun on ludes, Chaz?

383
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,376
Laser tag.

384
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,682
Whoa. Pervert alert.

385
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,578
I didn't come here to harm you...

386
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,589
or your girl.

387
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,023
I came here to give you shelter.

388
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,789
A future. Succor.

389
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,125
Sucker?

390
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,327
I don't know, man.

391
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,202
Look at me.

392
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,863
Look into my eyes.

393
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:46,307
You'll never have to use that knife again.

394
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,040
Come with me and live forever.

395
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,615
Young forever.

396
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,547
Strong as the night.

397
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,142
Strong as eternity.

398
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,517
Stronger than death.

399
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,659
I promised you strength and more.

400
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,855
All you must do is fight, one night, for me.

401
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,330
One night, and eternity is yours.

402
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,958
Yeah, no... no problem.

403
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,902
Hey, can we still screw?

404
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:17,270
Mister, speaking of forever,
what can kill us, anyway?

405
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,036
- The sun?
- No longer.

406
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,771
Sunscreens have changed things.

407
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,713
Daylight is merely uncomfortable for us,
if we are protected.

408
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,511
What if you're not?

409
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,813
You fry like fat on a griddle.

410
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,081
- What else?
- Precious little.

411
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:34,181
A beheading,
a wooden stake through the heart.

412
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,691
What about a steamroller?

413
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,261
What about crosses?

414
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,626
I wouldn't recommend the church.

415
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,836
Come. See my army
that I've been gathering

416
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,806
from across the territory.

417
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,183
Meet our newest acquisitions.

418
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,278
Say hello to Chaz...

419
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,448
and Burgundy.

420
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,923
Tomorrow night, my friends.

421
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,590
We attack Purgatory tomorrow night.

422
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,214
Hello.

423
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,487
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.

424
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,020
Do you have a...
a tow truck around here?

425
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,329
L... My car broke down, and...

426
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,905
I've been walking all night.

427
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,530
Sorry to hear it.

428
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,972
We ain't got no tow truck.

429
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,135
Do you have a phone?

430
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:03,404
This ain't your day, son.

431
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:09,342
I'm looking for a town called...

432
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,614
Purgatory?

433
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,280
Purgatory.

434
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,520
Never heard of it.

435
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,653
This old map says that it's...

436
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,328
that way, but,

437
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,526
well, it's not listed on any of the new ones.

438
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,933
Maybe it went down in the earthquake.

439
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,437
No, no. Highly doubtful.

440
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,440
There's no fault line in these parts.

441
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,737
How do you come to know so much?

442
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:35,074
I sort of make it my business.

443
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:40,942
I don't suppose you'd want to...

444
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,417
give me a ride?

445
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,715
Nope. Don't reckon so.

446
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,950
I didn't think you would.

447
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,650
Well...

448
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,387
Be seeing ya.

449
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,870
You think they're advertising this place

450
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,442
in some tourist brochure?

451
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,806
There's got to be a logical explanation.

452
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,748
Your wife was nearly raped by a bat,

453
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:17,219
while you sat downstairs working.

454
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,311
Logical enough?

455
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,754
I told you, Mommy!

456
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,258
It wasn't a bat!
It was a vampire!

457
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,827
Do you see?

458
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,759
Do you see what you're
turning your daughter into?

459
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,422
My daughter?

460
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,762
Gwen, why don't you take
your sister upstairs and play?

461
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,631
Okay. Come on.

462
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,671
But, Mommy,
I saw a vampire on top of you!

463
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,673
I saw it all!

464
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,403
Do you think we should
take Julie to a physicist?

465
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,480
Psychiatrist, darling.
No, Julie is fine.

466
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,104
Aren't you, sweetheart?

467
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,274
You've just been having
some nightmares, that's all.

468
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,353
You've all been watching
too many damn horror films.

469
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,082
Now, I am going to work.

470
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,318
And when I get back,
I don't want to hear any more of this.

471
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:56,393
All right?

472
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,198
Long time, no see.

473
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:12,834
Can't say I'd noticed.

474
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,504
I understand you have a problem here.

475
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,007
Yeah.

476
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,279
We got this thing flowing pretty well
at a trickling pace,

477
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:25,413
but when we try to increase production,
something screws up.

478
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,754
So I suggested we get you
to have a look at your design.

479
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,521
You suggested me?

480
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:31,925
That's big of you, Shane.

481
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,190
I'm a pretty big guy, Dave.

482
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,891
Well, there are no problems
with my process.

483
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,493
It worked in the lab
and it will work in the factory.

484
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,835
Well, I just followed your instructions.

485
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,932
Apparently not well enough.

486
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,374
Are you suggesting...

487
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:47,910
Suggesting what?

488
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,604
That you made a mistake?

489
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,875
That Saint Shane, the boy wonder,

490
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,746
the charm school graduate,

491
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,979
might have made a boo-boo?

492
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,748
Boo-boo?

493
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,324
Does it still hurt that I had your wife?

494
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,450
Does it still hurt
that she dumped you for me?

495
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,757
Well, she needed someone
she could push around, a wimp.

496
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,128
- Asshole.
- And she got one.

497
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,659
How is Sarah anyway?

498
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,600
And the kids?

499
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,903
Gwendolyn and Juliet, the youngest.

500
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,602
Let's get to work, Dave.

501
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,575
Sandy, that was so bad.

502
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,051
Just like these burgers.

503
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,880
Looks like you've seen better days.

504
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,511
And nights.

505
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,852
Just coffee, please.

506
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,555
Make it strong?

507
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,866
Sure. Just a sec.

508
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,919
Nice town you have here.

509
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,494
Not the easiest place to find.

510
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,530
Probably why we don't get many strangers.

511
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,168
What might you be doing in Purgatory?

512
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,397
Just traveling, you know,

513
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:57,201
town to town, job to job.

514
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,868
Nothing to do around here.

515
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,673
Not since the copper mines closed.

516
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,577
Well, my car broke down last night, and...

517
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,150
No one to fix it 'round here.

518
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,344
Best have your coffee and be on your way.

519
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,480
You might be able to hitch a lift
out on the main road.

520
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,855
Don't want to be stuck
in these parts around dark.

521
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,686
I guess not.

522
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,525
Guess not.

523
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,304
Anything else?

524
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:46,148
You wouldn't happened
to have seen this man?

525
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,554
That's Count Mardulak.

526
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,182
Count Mardulak?

527
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:54,556
If that's all,
I'll be getting your check.

528
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,466
That'll be a dollar.

529
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:16,879
Well, I'll just be moving along.

530
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,512
On to the next.

531
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,458
Nice meeting you folks.

532
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,100
I saw those looks you were giving him, girl.

533
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,403
What looks?

534
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,000
What looks?

535
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:44,240
Looks that belong on
a 20-year-old human, not on you.

536
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,440
I am 20.

537
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,246
But you ain't no human.

538
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:51,412
I only came over six months ago.

539
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,150
And there's no going back.

540
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,421
Tell Nigel to nuke me up
some cheeseburgers

541
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:00,019
for those humans in my jail.

542
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,827
I'm going out on patrol.

543
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:10,902
Shane, Shane, Shane.

544
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,873
Baby blunder.

545
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:15,138
You've got the wrong damn
backflow valve on here.

546
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:18,113
When you step up production,
it shuts down the flow regulator.

547
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,184
Yeah, well, it must've been installed
by the construction crew.

548
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,149
No, I'm afraid not, Shane.
It's your mistake.

549
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,585
You specified it right here.

550
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,657
You're a heck of an engineer, Shane.

551
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:35,297
Tell me, Dave, does Sarah
still whimper when she comes?

552
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,133
Or does she still come?

553
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,506
Shane, you sad thing.

554
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:45,835
Oh, yeah.

555
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,808
I used to love to see her on her knees.

556
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,119
I've never been second to anyone, Harrison,

557
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:02,658
and I sure as hell won't be second to you.

558
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,094
I'll have what I want when I want it.

559
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,826
Get the picture, Boo-Boo?

560
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,168
Special from the Purgatory Cafe:
Cheeseburgers,

561
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:22,337
and for those of us on diets,
protein drinks.

562
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:25,643
Damn synthesized blood.

563
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,650
You must be seeing things again.

564
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,583
Why cover it up?

565
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,621
Only two things we can do with 'em:

566
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,713
Kill them or convert them,

567
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:35,883
like with that Shane Dennis.

568
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,756
Mardulak needed him.

569
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,457
These guys, either way, there's no point

570
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,659
in hiding what we are, ma...

571
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,258
Mort.

572
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,927
Blood? Convert us?
What's he talking about?

573
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,938
You've picked a bad spot

574
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,201
for a camping trip.

575
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,723
I'm taking my break.

576
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:07,882
Fine.

577
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:19,933
Well, if it isn't Mardulak's favorite dish.

578
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,766
Excuse me, Ethan.

579
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,897
In a bit of a rush, are we?

580
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,432
Careful, girl.

581
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,569
It's getting hot in Purgatory.

582
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,643
You wanna hear about my dream, Gwen?

583
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,655
Another crazy dream.

584
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,418
What happened in this one?

585
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,392
It was a vampires' war and bloody and...

586
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,156
How come you're so weird?

587
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,165
You don't believe anything, do you?

588
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,598
Oh, Julie!

589
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,303
Wow, a secret passage.

590
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,105
Come on.

591
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,681
It's too dark.

592
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,381
Come on.

593
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,721
There's no monsters here.

594
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,851
I think so.

595
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,020
Gwen!

596
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,360
Let's explore.

597
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,703
Wow, a coffin!

598
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,542
Let's look inside.

599
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,616
Very bad idea.

600
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,810
Come on. Just a peek.

601
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,887
Gwen!

602
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,355
Stop being such a coward.

603
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,925
It's a good dare.

604
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,363
Then I'll do it myself.

605
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,419
Monster!

606
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,020
Help me, Julie!

607
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,069
Mommy! Mommy!

608
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,969
Whoa...

609
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,439
- Big monster!
- What? Where?

610
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,873
- In the library?
- Yes!

611
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,241
Calm... What are you talking...

612
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:50,052
I am Jozek Mardulak, Mrs. Harrison.

613
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,088
I own Purgatory.

614
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,419
I live in the mansion opposite.

615
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,254
I was working in the cellar

616
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,454
when your daughters, well, appeared.

617
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,292
I'm sorry.

618
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,334
Oh, please.
No reason to apologize.

619
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:07,927
There is a secret passage
that goes between the two mansions.

620
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,972
And the little fiends found it, huh?

621
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,702
- How come you were in the coffin?
- Gwen.

622
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,243
I'm sorry. She doesn't...

623
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,074
That's quite all right.

624
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,613
It's very dim down there.

625
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:21,014
My dear departed mother rests there.

626
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:24,451
Her last and final request.

627
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:27,718
Once a week I go down
and pay my respects.

628
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,055
I'm afraid I was standing by the coffin

629
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:34,461
when your beautiful daughters appeared.

630
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,691
They must have thought...

631
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,530
Oh, say no more.
I'm so sorry.

632
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,228
You know children.

633
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,531
Yes.

634
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,767
But what would we do without them?

635
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,639
Could I offer you tea or anything?

636
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,610
No, that's quite all right.

637
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:53,240
I must return to my dear departed mother.

638
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:57,377
But I'm quite sure we shall meet again.

639
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,732
He came out of the coffin.

640
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,864
Swear it! Right, Julie?

641
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,204
- It was dark.
- Not that dark.

642
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,538
Put a wager on it?

643
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,668
Mom.

644
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,337
Next week's allowance.

645
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:24,971
We'll go down there right now.

646
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,915
- Is it a bet?
- The whole allowance?

647
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,452
Every penny.

648
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,156
It was dark down there.

649
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:37,227
And he could have been standing
beside the coffin, right?

650
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,195
- I suppose so.
- Good.

651
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:43,027
Now I don't want to hear
another word about it, all right?

652
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,401
Mom doesn't play fair.

653
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:53,335
Wanna go biking?

654
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,571
Yeah. Let's buy some candy, too, okay?

655
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,340
Yeah!

656
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,092
Well, this is certainly
an odd place to meet.

657
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,467
I had to get you out of Purgatory.

658
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,164
Really?

659
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,401
Hi, I'm Sandy White.

660
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,568
My name's Robert Van Hel...

661
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,305
Van what?

662
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,644
Robert Van Hell. That's it.

663
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,345
So now what can you tell me
about the man in the picture?

664
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,717
We can't talk here. Get in.

665
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:46,318
Looks like we won't ever be tasting
human blood again.

666
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,921
The Hemotechnics plant works like a dream.

667
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,364
Seems Harrison has fixed it,

668
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:53,027
so mass production won't be a problem.

669
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,430
What's the matter, Bailey?

670
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,474
Don't you like it?

671
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,907
Artificial blood.

672
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,501
I'm never gonna get used to this garbage.

673
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:05,639
Don't you ever miss warm human blood?

674
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,981
The thrill of sinking your teeth
into young, soft flesh?

675
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:14,185
Seeing the ecstasy in their eyes

676
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,954
as they give themselves
to us... completely?

677
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,326
You are the last one in Purgatory

678
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,093
to have had a human.

679
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,191
Mardulak picked you.

680
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:26,792
You lucky bastard.

681
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,668
Tell us, what was it like?

682
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,105
Yeah.

683
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,905
Shane.

684
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:42,682
There aren't many
young people in Purgatory.

685
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,913
It can be terribly lonely.

686
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,255
Right.

687
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,854
Now, you said that you knew
where I could find this man.

688
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:58,331
Do we have to talk about that now?

689
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,869
Well, I...

690
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,563
I thought that's why we were here.

691
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,971
And you said that you wanted

692
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,702
to get out of P...

693
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,429
- No! No!
- Too late.

694
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:30,898
I wasn't going to bite you!

695
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,161
I promise.

696
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,432
I just needed to kiss...
to kiss a man again.

697
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,370
That's a likely story.

698
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:38,839
Look!

699
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:42,537
I could take you to Mardulak,
your friend in the picture.

700
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,448
Okay.

701
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,384
Let's go see what that noise is all about.

702
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,548
All right, now, no tricks.

703
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,853
This is holy water.

704
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,587
Come on.

705
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:44,167
Mysterious doings, Shane.

706
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,901
What is it you're doing, man?

707
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:49,342
Well, let's see now, Quint,

708
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:50,879
it'd be work for Jefferson.

709
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:53,449
Mind if I take a look?

710
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,984
I'm afraid so.

711
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,348
Who are they?

712
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:58,648
That's Shane Dennis.

713
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,986
- He's the designer of the blood plant.
- The what?

714
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,456
He was human when he got here.

715
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:03,753
You mean that he's also a...

716
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,989
It was the first try at integrating
people into Purgatory.

717
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,291
It failed.

718
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:12,027
When he found out, he panicked.

719
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,626
So they turned him into a...

720
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:14,704
They needed him.

721
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:16,102
- So how many...
- What?

722
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:17,503
- Of you...
- Vampires?

723
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,576
Yes, vampires, are there?

724
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:21,667
The whole town.

725
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,111
Apart from the Harrisons.

726
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:26,114
And the two in jail.

727
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:29,746
Now, look, rookie.

728
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,515
If it's a test of strength
you want, you lose.

729
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:36,252
I have been a vampire 135 years.

730
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:41,059
I guess you're stronger
and faster than I am.

731
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,962
You're still not gonna see in those crates.

732
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,660
You're a child, man.

733
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,703
You cannot stop me.

734
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,737
You're gonna be in big trouble now, Shane.

735
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,476
Mr. Jefferson, I'm glad you arrived.

736
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,709
Shane here is giving me a lot of trouble.

737
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:01,785
Do they work?

738
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,615
Just about to find out.

739
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,627
What you gonna do with that?

740
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,218
Shoot me a Rasta vampire.

741
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:29,837
They work.

742
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,776
Fortified wood.

743
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:37,353
Splinters on impact.

744
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:40,184
Shane, you are a genius.

745
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:43,987
And tonight a hundred more
domesticated abominations will die.

746
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:50,657
The revolution.
I have to warn the others.

747
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:52,200
The count!

748
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:53,735
Good idea.

749
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,397
Let's go visit the count.

750
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:59,100
You don't understand.
Things have changed.

751
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,938
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

752
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,708
Jefferson sure as hell turned me on.

753
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,683
You can practically
smell the blood from here.

754
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,412
Mardulak's wrong.

755
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,889
Humans and vampires
ain't never gonna coexist.

756
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,087
He told you.

757
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:49,750
David, look, you were in med school.

758
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,418
I never saw you.

759
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,325
Shane called me and asked me
to dinner one night.

760
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,866
It was one time, David.
One night.

761
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,434
And Juliet.

762
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:00,970
Is she mine?

763
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,439
David, I don't know.

764
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:07,805
I think she is.

765
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:11,472
Why can't you just lie to me?

766
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:14,778
Just swear that you love me
and that it never happened.

767
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:23,116
I mean, it's bad enough
that you ever slept with him, but...

768
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,091
for you to do it after we were married.

769
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:32,232
And the way he lords over me.

770
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,633
Shit.

771
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:35,500
I'm not staying.

772
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:36,833
It's to hell with it.

773
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,737
The hell with the house,
the hell with the plant,

774
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:40,776
the hell with everything.

775
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,310
How far to this mansion?

776
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,460
Look out.

777
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,472
Hi.

778
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,440
Hi.

779
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:14,510
Bye.

780
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,135
Bye.

781
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,111
He was the one in my dream...

782
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,186
the vampire with Mommy.

783
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,087
Come, child.

784
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:03,819
Tell us about the dream.

785
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:08,261
Damn, I can taste that
fresh young blood already.

786
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:11,061
If I got started, I couldn't stop.

787
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:12,795
Hey, Mort, save some for us!

788
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,394
Know what's going on, don't ya?

789
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,405
Lynch mob?

790
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,407
In a way.

791
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:23,809
What you're looking at
is a crowd of hungry vampires.

792
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,041
That's right.

793
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:29,118
Purgatory's a town full of them.

794
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,119
I'm one.

795
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:32,950
You two ain't.

796
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,887
And that's the problem.

797
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:37,960
The problem is you're
some kind of psychotic nut.

798
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,824
Alice.

799
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:47,268
Didn't get these in 7-Eleven.

800
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,763
The problem is there's only two things

801
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:54,071
can happen to you in Purgatory.

802
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:55,974
They can kill you,

803
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,946
or they can turn you into a vampire,

804
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:02,610
like me, like all of us.

805
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,812
Make sure there's enough
to go around, Mort!

806
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,013
Letting us go.

807
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,024
Ain't in the cards.

808
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,927
Don't drain 'em dry, Mort.

809
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:46,026
Tired of hunting, you said.

810
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:47,721
Tired of killing.

811
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,425
Tired of the life of a vampire.

812
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:53,469
Tired, you said.
Each one of you.

813
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,538
You, where were you

814
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,335
when I first asked you to join me?

815
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,272
You were crying in the Pyrenees

816
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,174
after having killed a ten-year-old boy.

817
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:03,246
Mardulak, I...

818
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,679
You, you made your home in the sewers.

819
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:09,081
You killed winos.

820
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,019
You, farmers' children.

821
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:15,421
Our lives were full of murder.

822
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:19,052
That's why I put so much
money into Purgatory.

823
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:23,121
That's why I invested
in the synthesizing of blood.

824
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,828
A new life, a chance for serenity,

825
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:31,533
a faint hope that we might finally
make peace with our maker.

826
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,508
I know, it's not going to be easy

827
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,239
to live with mortals.

828
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:41,010
Not easy to hide our ways from them.

829
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,449
But we must learn to coexist.

830
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,612
We must treat them as equals.

831
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,713
We need them.

832
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:50,088
And when we have finally got our factory

833
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:53,890
into mass production, they will need us.

834
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,830
For those of you who wish to defy me,

835
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,867
remember...

836
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,960
I am the greatest of our kind.

837
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,236
If you cannot obey me...

838
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,143
Now go!

839
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,648
Well, I'm convinced.

840
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,704
Let's go, honey.

841
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:39,400
It was a bad idea to come here
in the first place.

842
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:42,478
Let's get the girls and let's go home.

843
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:47,578
We can work it out, but...

844
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:50,983
not here, not now.

845
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,623
Please?

846
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,559
I love you, Sarah.

847
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,138
I love you, too.

848
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,504
I'm sorry, Mardulak,

849
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:15,077
but I lost my temper.

850
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:16,736
I should kill you,

851
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,837
but I'm tired of killing.

852
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,813
Then what?

853
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,714
I can't send you anywhere.

854
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,151
We all have to stay here near the plant

855
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,553
or all this, this town,

856
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,182
my dream of the future,
will mean nothing.

857
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,727
The only punishment is death.

858
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:37,493
No, I think you should stay here
in jail one more night

859
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,262
and then, tomorrow, you can go home.

860
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:45,470
But if you ever do anything
without my permission again...

861
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:47,736
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

862
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:52,937
All right. That's enough, Mort.

863
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,017
What about them?

864
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,157
Mardulak, come quick.

865
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:08,924
The Harrison girls.
One of them had a dream.

866
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,330
You must speak with her.

867
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,033
Are you sure the girls went into town?

868
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:20,609
Yeah, I think so.

869
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,073
Turn around.
They're in that car!

870
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,037
Hold it.

871
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:14,696
Okay.

872
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:15,924
There's our way up.

873
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:20,128
Now, no bat stuff
or anything like that, you hear me?

874
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:23,535
You know, you're very cute.

875
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:34,310
No, that would never work.

876
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,409
All right, come on. Come on.

877
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:37,850
We got work to do.

878
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,581
Up you go.

879
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:46,613
If I can... just get a...

880
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:48,054
Okay.

881
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,626
Well...

882
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,789
that wasn't so bad.

883
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,644
What are you gonna do now?

884
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:12,943
Wait till they get back.

885
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:20,178
Sorry, I forgot.

886
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,417
Okay. It's okay.

887
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:29,259
Then, down through the skylight.

888
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,671
And pop!

889
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:38,741
End to the count's vile reign.

890
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,206
But you don't understand.

891
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,005
Times are changing.

892
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,375
Now don't start all over again with that.

893
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,042
Once a bloodsucker,
always a bloodsucker.

894
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,347
You just don't want to listen, do you?

895
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,133
Let go of my daughters.

896
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,070
Hello again.

897
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:21,241
You know this... this kidnapper?

898
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:22,443
Of course, darling.

899
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,383
That's our host, Count Mardulak.

900
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:28,082
He is, is he? You are?

901
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:29,658
Well, what are you doing
with my daughters?

902
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,784
Dad, he just wanted to talk to Julie.

903
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:33,953
About her dreams.

904
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,725
But come, let's not waste time out here.

905
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:37,925
I want to hear more.

906
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:43,630
Really, honey.

907
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,503
And remember,

908
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,838
don't take on bat form
unless you have to.

909
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:51,038
Our strength is in these.

910
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,172
If we get into hand-to-hand combat,

911
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:55,477
we don't stand a chance.

912
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:58,486
And aim carefully.

913
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:03,389
I want the Harrison woman
and the blonde child taken alive.

914
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,893
Some of us will die this night,

915
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,192
but the world of vampires
will remember us as gods,

916
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:11,892
fighting for the right to hunt humans

917
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,299
as it was always meant to be.

918
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:16,872
And we will kill for that right.

919
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:20,067
Death to Mardulak and his traitors.

920
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,150
Anyone care for a drink?

921
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:31,880
A bourbon perhaps?

922
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:34,684
- No, thanks.
- Maybe something stronger?

923
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,520
No, thank you.

924
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:39,151
Sit here, please.

925
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:47,929
Now, Juliet, tell us about your dream.

926
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,800
It was about a war,

927
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,636
a terrible war between vampires.

928
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,039
And many were killed.

929
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,474
Julie, please.

930
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:57,910
Mr. Harrison, this is not a joke.

931
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:01,745
There was a man,
slicked back hair and sideburns.

932
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:03,284
He was in charge.

933
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,650
- Shane.
- Are we being serious here?

934
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:08,815
David, can you just listen, please?

935
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,155
He had another man with him.

936
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,194
Grey hair and a white beard.

937
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:15,059
Jefferson.

938
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:21,562
There were lots of vampires.

939
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:23,434
They carried guns.

940
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:24,938
Guns?

941
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:37,149
Count Mardulak.

942
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,618
What's the matter?

943
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,348
You afraid to tell them your real name?

944
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:41,445
Do I know you?

945
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:44,048
Me? No.

946
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,926
But you may remember
my great grandfather,

947
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,760
Van Helsing... Senior.

948
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:55,065
You mean to tell me that
that sweet, misguided idiot

949
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,036
was your great grandfather?

950
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,107
Yes.

951
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:02,644
And it's taken me years
to finally trace you here,

952
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:05,908
to finally fulfill my family's destiny,

953
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:08,074
to finally...

954
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,648
to finally kill and destroy the...

955
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:15,018
That's enough.

956
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,113
Sarah, it's time to go.

957
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:17,749
Everybody is looney tunes around here.

958
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,090
Okay.

959
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:23,688
Are you ready to die, Count?

960
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,200
You Van Helsings never learn, do you?

961
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,772
Sandy.

962
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:33,467
What are you doing?

963
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:36,238
He came here this morning.
He was asking about you.

964
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,905
I kept with him to keep an eye on him,

965
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,381
to see what he was...
to see what he wanted.

966
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:44,581
But please don't hurt him.

967
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:46,450
He doesn't mean anything.

968
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:48,547
He's just confused.

969
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,991
I think perhaps you stayed with him

970
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:56,087
for other reasons than my safety, no?

971
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:01,768
Ladies and gentlemen,

972
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:06,535
what we have here is a vampire
in love with a human.

973
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:09,975
Better integration than
I could possibly have dreamed.

974
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,206
Count... Count Mardulak?

975
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:14,010
Will somebody call him
by his real... name?

976
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:15,777
Excuse me a second.

977
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,250
I really think we ought to be going.

978
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,117
The plant is working perfectly.

979
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,850
I'm a big-city type of guy

980
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,791
and it's just been a pleasure meeting you.

981
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,419
Bye, Count.
It's been a pleasure.

982
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,033
Move as fast as you can.

983
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:32,259
- We will.
- We will, thank you.

984
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,063
- Come on, Gwen.
- Bye.

985
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,368
What if they talk?

986
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:44,207
Do you really think
they believed a word of it?

987
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:47,646
But this one, on the other hand,

988
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,217
what can we do with him?

989
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:01,591
You'll have to kill me
before I stop hunting you down

990
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:03,756
like a filthy fanged fi...

991
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:20,646
I hear they're letting Mort back tomorrow.

992
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,548
That's good. That's good.

993
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,688
Sounds like trouble.

994
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,282
Better warn Mardulak.

995
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:01,185
In the heart. I told you.

996
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,053
In the heart!

997
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:14,062
What the hell are you doing, Jefferson?

998
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,137
Mardulak will...

999
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:19,164
Move out!

1000
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,064
Town full of crazies.

1001
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:24,935
They're not crazies, Daddy,
they're vampires.

1002
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,976
Juliet, I don't think your father's
in the mood right now.

1003
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:31,706
- Are we going home, Daddy?
- Yes.

1004
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:46,657
Come on. Come on.

1005
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:49,430
Oh, my goodness.

1006
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:53,797
Quick, follow me.

1007
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,962
Anna, quick.

1008
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:29,861
Alice.

1009
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:31,132
Alice, wake up.

1010
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:38,673
Let's go see what's going on.

1011
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:41,875
Alice, smile for me.

1012
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:43,417
- What?
- Smile.

1013
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:45,612
- Go like this.
- No!

1014
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:53,391
While you were sleeping,
I didn't have a choice.

1015
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:55,293
It was either that or kill you.

1016
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,957
It's not such a bad life...

1017
01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:59,864
death, whatever you want to call it.

1018
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,371
What am I going to tell my mother?

1019
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:11,712
- I can't go in public with these things.
- Don't worry.

1020
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:15,250
They only show when you're hungry
or overemotional.

1021
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,978
Overemotional?

1022
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:38,067
Keep your mind on one thing, Shane.

1023
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,698
Time enough for that later.

1024
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:44,239
Take your children.

1025
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,871
Try and make it back to Mardulak.

1026
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:48,472
This is all some sick joke, right?

1027
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,145
If you value your life, go now.

1028
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:52,584
- But we...
- David!

1029
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:54,622
Stop being so stubborn.
Let's go!

1030
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,588
Go! Go!

1031
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:04,964
We're here to set you free.

1032
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:06,898
Free, do you hear me?

1033
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:09,869
This is the only place
you've been free, Jefferson.

1034
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:13,533
You call this freedom?

1035
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,606
Just leave us alone.

1036
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,044
The plant works now.

1037
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,775
Yeah, get out of here.

1038
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,147
You've got two choices.

1039
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:26,278
Join us... or die.

1040
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:28,117
Don't make me laugh.

1041
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,021
You're the only one with any strength.

1042
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:31,592
There's too many of us.

1043
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:34,094
I could take every one of those punks.

1044
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:37,791
All right, you bottle-suckers,
are you with us or not?

1045
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,561
Jefferson's right.

1046
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:41,932
This ain't no life for a vampire.

1047
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:43,470
I'm with you, Jefferson.

1048
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:45,005
Bailey, what are you doing?

1049
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:47,041
We've worked too hard for this.

1050
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:48,973
Nigel, shut up.

1051
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,138
Bailey, think about your friends, okay?

1052
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,341
Let go of me, Nigel.
The man's talking sense.

1053
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,213
- You'd know it if you just listen.
- He's talking dumb.

1054
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:57,751
Take your arm off me

1055
01:10:57,853 --> 01:10:59,980
or I'm gonna tear it off of you
and shove it down your throat.

1056
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,353
Bailey, please, just listen to some sense.

1057
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:04,255
Come on, ain't nobody else coming with me?

1058
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,987
Or are you all a bunch of wimps

1059
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:10,498
like this little candy-assed
artificial bloodsucker?

1060
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,430
Don't push it.

1061
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:14,092
What are you gonna do about it?

1062
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,437
Anyone else?

1063
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:24,512
Enough.

1064
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:25,807
Guns?

1065
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:28,075
What kind of bullets can kill vampires?

1066
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,618
Wooden ones.

1067
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:34,951
Charge!

1068
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:36,354
Shit!

1069
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,035
Quick, into the plant!

1070
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,016
No.

1071
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:08,583
At last.

1072
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:11,683
Come on! Get up!

1073
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:13,056
Give me a gun! I want a gun!

1074
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,288
I'll kill every one of them!

1075
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:28,401
Grab anything wooden.

1076
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,375
Mort, find Mardulak.

1077
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:37,243
Our only chance
is to get hold of those guns.

1078
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,028
Welcome to the other side.

1079
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:26,927
It has begun.

1080
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:30,129
Shall we break out the crossbows, master?

1081
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,968
Yes.

1082
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,601
If it's war he wants...

1083
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:41,448
then it's war he'll get.

1084
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:46,921
- Jefferson!
- Good.

1085
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:48,990
That means there'll only
be punks around the back.

1086
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,116
Pierre, Pucci, and a few of us
will try and hold him off.

1087
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:53,490
Ramon, go get some firepower.

1088
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,085
You bet.

1089
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:04,472
Move, move, move!

1090
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:06,598
Hand over your guns, punks.

1091
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,311
It's been nice knowing you.

1092
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:16,111
Get them!

1093
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:17,810
Rico, duck.

1094
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,248
Where's the girl?

1095
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:57,586
I don't see the girl!

1096
01:14:57,693 --> 01:14:58,751
Forget her, Shane.

1097
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:00,522
I've done my part.

1098
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:05,391
James, get down!

1099
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:56,214
Great. No way out.

1100
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:57,615
Do something!

1101
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,210
What? I'm not a young man anymore.

1102
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,885
Neat trick, old man.

1103
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:19,269
They came back here.

1104
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:20,739
Easy.

1105
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,274
They out there?

1106
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,010
Damn! They got away.

1107
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:29,140
Back to the horses.

1108
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,548
Come on!

1109
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:36,053
Have they gone yet?

1110
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:38,217
Quiet.

1111
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:43,831
- You okay, David?
- Yeah.

1112
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,268
You son of a bitch.

1113
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:01,708
Looking a little sweaty, Dave.

1114
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,929
Come on, David.

1115
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:16,793
You've always been a wimp.

1116
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:20,467
All I want is Sarah and my daughter.

1117
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:21,831
Daughter?

1118
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:24,371
What's he mean, Mom?

1119
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:29,576
David!

1120
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:30,804
Shane, let him go!

1121
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:50,061
Put the girls in the car.

1122
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:53,658
Run! Get in the car, girls. Hurry!

1123
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:08,144
I never did like you, Shane.

1124
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,539
Why, Ethan?

1125
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:37,043
Your pitiful fear of God.

1126
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:40,410
We are special.
We are hunters.

1127
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:41,982
We kill.

1128
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:43,676
We feed on humans.

1129
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:46,015
Like a hundred other parasites.

1130
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:49,056
Like tapeworms. Like fleas.

1131
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:50,590
Like fungus.

1132
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:52,751
That's how special vampires are.

1133
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:54,761
Jefferson...

1134
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:57,832
I have a barrel pointed
straight at your ugly heart.

1135
01:18:57,933 --> 01:19:01,061
Tell your pathetic followers
to drop their weapons.

1136
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:02,431
Now!

1137
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:08,770
Do as he says.

1138
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,642
Put them down.

1139
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:19,711
Take their ammo.
Come on.

1140
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:20,845
- Hurry, hurry!
- Give me that.

1141
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:22,082
Take that ammo.

1142
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:25,883
Come on, let's go.
Let's go!

1143
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:30,030
Come on, Jones!
Hurry up. Come on!

1144
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,697
You feel like going for a ride?

1145
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,099
- What?
- Come on, come on!

1146
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:38,271
Go on. Hurry.

1147
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:40,508
- Hold on.
- There you go.

1148
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,103
- Hang on tight, Julie.
- Move it.

1149
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:49,843
Move!

1150
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:18,874
After them!

1151
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:44,005
Hurry! Run!

1152
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:45,766
Okay. Wait, wait.

1153
01:20:45,874 --> 01:20:47,569
All right, the secret
passageway in the library.

1154
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:48,904
- You remember where it is?
- Yes, Mommy.

1155
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,535
- All right, do you remember how to get in?
- Spin the globe.

1156
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:54,444
I want you to go in there
and I want you to find a place to hide.

1157
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:56,710
Don't let anyone see you. Go!

1158
01:20:56,818 --> 01:20:58,342
Go! Run! Hurry, run!

1159
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:06,027
Sarah!

1160
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:08,061
Juliet!

1161
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:09,255
Daddy's here.

1162
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:27,611
I know you're here somewhere.

1163
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,116
It's only a matter of time.

1164
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,547
David! Where are you going?

1165
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,310
David, get back!

1166
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:05,384
David!

1167
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,214
Let me out!
I've got to get across.

1168
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:11,918
It's too late.

1169
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:13,995
Shane!

1170
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:16,928
Come on back.
I know a way.

1171
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:19,000
Here, take this.

1172
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:50,094
You wanna play rough, eh?

1173
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:24,722
You said there was another way over.

1174
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:27,825
Mardulak, I'm going to take David
through the passageway.

1175
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:30,029
We've got to stay together.

1176
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:32,733
That's his wife over there.

1177
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,968
You've been a vampire too long.

1178
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:36,566
- All right!
- David.

1179
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:39,374
It's holy water.

1180
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:41,142
You may need it.

1181
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:42,716
Come on then.

1182
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:45,081
You can't go with just
a human for protection.

1183
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:47,746
Dan, look after them!

1184
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:50,421
Cover us!

1185
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:01,632
Go!

1186
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,704
Isn't it wonderful how the world works

1187
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:15,510
in its mysterious ways?

1188
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:23,921
Whatever will be, will be.

1189
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:29,658
About a year ago, I'm sitting
at home when the phone rings.

1190
01:24:29,764 --> 01:24:31,197
It's David.

1191
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:33,199
David, of all assholes.

1192
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:35,326
Some sucker's gone
and bought his process.

1193
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:37,302
But he can't go and build it.

1194
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:38,838
He's on another job.

1195
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,567
So he asks me...

1196
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:42,506
You were in class together.

1197
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:43,770
You used to be friends.

1198
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:46,312
You're the only other person
who knew anything about that process.

1199
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:49,406
Yeah, he used to bore me
with his bullshit all day.

1200
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:51,109
Anyhow, I go.

1201
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:52,709
Hell, why not?

1202
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:55,085
The money was good.

1203
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:57,420
Cash.

1204
01:24:57,525 --> 01:24:59,493
It takes me a while
to figure out the real reason

1205
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:00,754
they need a blood plant.

1206
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:03,763
So then they make me into a vampire.

1207
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:05,594
Voila.

1208
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,894
Idea.

1209
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:08,662
Block a valve.

1210
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,671
Persuade them.
"We need David. "

1211
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,333
You see, I know he won't go anywhere

1212
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:17,104
without his beautiful wife and kids.

1213
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:19,737
Find out that Jefferson
is planning a revolution.

1214
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:22,282
Even better.
Time it perfectly.

1215
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:26,342
And now, you're here on this wild night.

1216
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,718
You and my daughter.

1217
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:31,314
I told David about Juliet.

1218
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:33,951
You should have seen his face.

1219
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:36,428
Well, I couldn't get you when I was human.

1220
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:40,262
You still wanted that
half-baked wiener, David.

1221
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:42,131
But now...

1222
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:45,104
now there's nothing
you can do to stop me.

1223
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:56,446
I came to visit you the other night.

1224
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:57,745
Remember?

1225
01:25:57,852 --> 01:26:01,652
Flap, flap, flap.

1226
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:04,190
Shane, don't.

1227
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:07,090
And now, my dark angel,

1228
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:09,527
take my immortal kiss.

1229
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:11,155
Shane, don't.

1230
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:13,962
Tell me you want me, Sarah.

1231
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:19,773
Tell me you want me, baby.

1232
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:25,835
Shane.

1233
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:27,608
Take me.

1234
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:35,984
Take me.

1235
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:38,490
No! No!

1236
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:39,525
Sarah!

1237
01:26:39,627 --> 01:26:41,060
David, up here!

1238
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:42,823
You want to watch him die?

1239
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:45,591
This is personal.

1240
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,998
David!

1241
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:50,635
Sarah!

1242
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:56,610
You got about a half a second

1243
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,838
to step away from my wife, Shane.

1244
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:01,677
- David.
- You okay?

1245
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:03,080
I'm all right.

1246
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:05,881
Time's up.

1247
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:39,717
In the heart, David.

1248
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:42,449
In the heart.

1249
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:48,122
Stranglers in the night,

1250
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:50,254
exchanging glances.

1251
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:53,493
Lovers at first bite.

1252
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:58,599
Good. Slow, slow.

1253
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:07,705
Ready?

1254
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:29,435
The gun!
Throw me the gun!

1255
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:47,346
In the heart, Shane.

1256
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:48,649
In the heart.

1257
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:01,128
Maybe we should see what damage

1258
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:02,930
<i>we can do from this side, ja?</i>

1259
01:29:03,037 --> 01:29:04,368
Right.

1260
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:05,939
Will you be okay?

1261
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,439
I'll be fine.

1262
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,417
Let's go!

1263
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:21,880
Get back to Mardulak.
You don't stand a chance.

1264
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:25,117
- I want to help you!
- It's not your war.

1265
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:26,818
I got an idea.

1266
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,725
I told the girls to hide down here.

1267
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:32,231
- Gwen!
- Juliet!

1268
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:33,925
- This is Daddy.
- It's okay.

1269
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:35,229
Come on.
You don't have to hide...

1270
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:38,100
No! Girls.

1271
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,834
Someone must have stolen
Mardulak's mother.

1272
01:29:40,942 --> 01:29:42,000
It was empty.

1273
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:44,078
Mommy and Daddy have
to do something, all right?

1274
01:29:44,178 --> 01:29:45,668
- Good hiding place?
- The best.

1275
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:46,940
But you can't come out yet.

1276
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:48,515
- Mom.
- McDonald's.

1277
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:50,015
- Big Mac?
- Each.

1278
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:52,143
Deal. Hide.

1279
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:16,533
Stop firing.

1280
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:23,274
Well, now...

1281
01:30:23,384 --> 01:30:24,783
look what we got here.

1282
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:26,410
Don't worry, little pretty.

1283
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:28,045
I ain't gonna shoot you.

1284
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:33,651
I'm gonna kill you
with my own dirty hands.

1285
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,834
And before you die,

1286
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:44,029
you're gonna feel these dirty hands

1287
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:47,437
all over your clean, white body.

1288
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:49,066
What are you gonna do with that?

1289
01:30:49,177 --> 01:30:50,576
It ain't gonna rain.

1290
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:16,728
Wood! I need wood!

1291
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:18,328
David!

1292
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:26,138
More wood!

1293
01:31:35,723 --> 01:31:37,156
I ran out of bullets.

1294
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,961
Stop firing. Stop firing.

1295
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:43,792
Hold your fire!

1296
01:31:43,898 --> 01:31:46,230
Mardulak?

1297
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:48,564
I have a friend of yours here.

1298
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:51,604
If you want to see
her pretty face alive again,

1299
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:53,333
throw down your guns.

1300
01:31:55,476 --> 01:31:57,205
Do as he says!

1301
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,207
Shoot them.

1302
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:32,643
Are you going to simply kill us, Jefferson,

1303
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:35,238
without ever really knowing?

1304
01:32:35,349 --> 01:32:38,182
You always said we were the same age.

1305
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:40,481
That you could beat me one on one.

1306
01:32:40,588 --> 01:32:44,183
Or was that just some more
of your Jeffersonian bullshit?

1307
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:47,623
Don't push me, Mardulak.

1308
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:50,856
I'm giving you and your pathetic wimps
a chance to die quickly.

1309
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:53,092
Why? Are you afraid?

1310
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:56,595
And this is the man

1311
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:59,070
you're willing to risk eternity for?

1312
01:32:59,173 --> 01:33:00,663
All right, Mardulak.

1313
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:01,742
Give me your gun.

1314
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:04,606
Don't worry.
She'll be all right.

1315
01:33:04,712 --> 01:33:06,543
Back!

1316
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:08,410
You, give him yours.

1317
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:22,754
Vampire to vampire.

1318
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:31,895
Pass me the wood.

1319
01:33:35,476 --> 01:33:37,034
Do you mind telling me what you're doing?

1320
01:33:37,144 --> 01:33:38,839
We're going up on the roof.

1321
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:40,367
You beat me.

1322
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:42,806
How the hell did you beat me?

1323
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:46,869
Did you really think we were
the same age, pilgrim?

1324
01:34:48,282 --> 01:34:50,307
I was getting a little too famous.

1325
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:52,147
I had to change my name.

1326
01:34:52,253 --> 01:34:54,221
Change your...

1327
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:55,686
It's not possible.

1328
01:34:57,692 --> 01:34:59,717
Don't be so shocked.

1329
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:01,556
Think of it this way.

1330
01:35:01,662 --> 01:35:03,755
The last thing you will ever see

1331
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:06,196
will be the face of the greatest vampire

1332
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,631
the world has ever known.

1333
01:35:07,735 --> 01:35:09,032
It can't be. He died.

1334
01:35:09,136 --> 01:35:10,330
He died, I tell you.

1335
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:15,241
Count Dracula.

1336
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:17,776
It's been a pleasure knowing you.

1337
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:23,341
Good-bye, Jefferson.

1338
01:35:31,158 --> 01:35:34,719
You should have died all those years ago.

1339
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:37,525
At least you would have died as a god,

1340
01:35:37,631 --> 01:35:39,895
not as a traitor to your kind.

1341
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,365
Shoot them.

1342
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,934
Push! Push!

1343
01:37:03,517 --> 01:37:05,712
We have been forgiven.

1344
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:08,118
At last.

1345
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:10,782
We've been forgiven.

1346
01:37:15,629 --> 01:37:17,722
My limo will carry you back home.

1347
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,824
And, of course, we will fix
and return your car to you.

1348
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:23,733
You sure you don't want me to stay
and help you rebuild your plant?

1349
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,169
No, it's not necessary.

1350
01:37:25,272 --> 01:37:26,967
Now that we have your blueprints,

1351
01:37:27,074 --> 01:37:29,338
I'm sure we can do it fine by ourselves.

1352
01:37:29,443 --> 01:37:31,411
That's quite a task.

1353
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:33,776
There are many more of us
out there to be converted.

1354
01:37:33,881 --> 01:37:36,111
This town is only the beginning.

1355
01:37:36,217 --> 01:37:39,243
Was he telling the truth
about being my daddy?

1356
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:41,048
Julie, don't be silly.

1357
01:37:41,155 --> 01:37:43,646
He was a mad person, lying, that's all.

1358
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:45,349
You mean...

1359
01:37:45,459 --> 01:37:48,019
Yes. Daddy's your dad.

1360
01:37:49,129 --> 01:37:50,756
Dad.

1361
01:37:52,466 --> 01:37:54,058
I love you, Daddy.

1362
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:57,865
I love you, sweetheart.

1363
01:37:57,972 --> 01:38:02,102
And remember, the past is the past.

1364
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:05,042
We have begun a new life tonight.

1365
01:38:05,145 --> 01:38:06,737
Let us hope it is not in vain.

1366
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:11,383
In vein!

1367
01:38:13,821 --> 01:38:16,051
L... I kind of like it.

1368
01:38:17,258 --> 01:38:19,624
- Let's go home.
- Let's go home.

1369
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:21,058
Let's go.
Get in the car.

1370
01:38:21,161 --> 01:38:23,356
Quick, quick. Bye.

1371
01:38:25,332 --> 01:38:27,562
With... With the...

1372
01:38:27,668 --> 01:38:29,602
See, we're vampires.

1373
01:38:29,703 --> 01:38:30,670
We got the...
