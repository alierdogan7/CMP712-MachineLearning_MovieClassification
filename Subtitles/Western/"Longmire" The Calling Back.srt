[insects chirping]

2
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:26,853
[Seth] It doesn't cry out when it's shot?

3
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:29,254
[Mitch] No, man.

4
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:30,648
Shut up.

5
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:32,966
[rustling]

6
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,885
- Mitch! Dude.
- Shh.

7
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:36,988
- You got to chill.
- Yeah.

8
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:39,515
Stay here. I'm gonna go down by the creek.

9
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:42,076
There might be a few
of them taking a drink.

10
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:44,645
- Split up?
- Shh.

11
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:46,689
Stop talking, man.

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,583
[sighs]

13
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:55,256
And remember, if you see
something, shoot something.

14
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:23,034
[gunshot]

15
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,751
Mitch?

16
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:33,503
Mitch!

17
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,504
Mitch!

00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:02,198
Walt. Hey.

21
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:05,409
Morning. Uh, I brought you mail.

22
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:10,414
Yeah. I was gonna get that.

23
00:02:13,944 --> 00:02:15,628
Coffee? I can...

24
00:02:16,153 --> 00:02:18,422
make some coffee? Okay.

00:02:19,282 --> 00:02:20,323

00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:25,746
[sighs] Um, I haven't had time...

28
00:02:25,747 --> 00:02:27,289
Plants and mail and stuff.

29
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,752
I've just, um, been so busy
with work and everything,

30
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:34,421
I just, um, haven't had
time, you know, so...

31
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:37,424
- Vic, um...
- You know, it's usually nice.

32
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:40,010
You know, like, this
nice, cute little house,

33
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:43,179
but, like, with work and
everything, I just, um...

34
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,932
- Vic, um...
- ...ran out of time. Yeah.

35
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:48,435
I, uh, don't know how to
say what I'm about to say,

36
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,162
so I'm just gonna say it.

37
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:52,999
I have to evict you.

38
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:01,632
What? No.

39
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:06,745
Uh... Sean's company gave us
this, um... him... this house

40
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:09,599
as part of his package, and I just, um...

41
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,934
[sighs]

42
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:18,007
Shit. Uh, they have been
sending these notices,

43
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:22,594
and I-I just didn't really look at
them and paid much attention to them.

44
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:24,262
I've just been so...

45
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:25,639
- I'll... I'll get it.
- Sorry.

46
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,159
...busy with work and everything.

47
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,246
Vic, should I be worried about you?

48
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,915
What?

49
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:37,085
God, no, no.

50
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,528
I have been to your place.

51
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:42,447
- [laughs]
- Fair enough.

52
00:03:42,448 --> 00:03:46,094
Anyway, I brought some
boxes. I can help you move.

53
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:48,054
Today?

54
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:52,224
Right. Of course, it's eviction day.

55
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,560
Shit.

56
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:09,200
I'm early.

57
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:14,646
This desk was empty,
but I can... I can move.

58
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:17,440
Oh, no, no. Um, no, that's your desk.

59
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,709
Okay.

60
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,380
[sighs]

61
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:25,216
Anything I can do?

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,703
Uh, it's eviction day.

63
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:34,058
Just, uh, a lot of paperwork.

64
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,310
Um, you know...

65
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,480
- Okay.
- Happy to help.

66
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:43,400
Oh [scoffs] pretty complicated.

67
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,945
All right.

68
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:51,993
I'll be... be here.

69
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,997
I'll just, uh...

70
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:01,151
- [Mitch] Hey, man.
- Hey.

71
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:03,295
[Mitch] We, uh, need to report something.

72
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:04,380
Crime report?

73
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:08,342
Not really. We just, uh, saw
something while we were out hunting.

74
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,928
You can take this one.

75
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:13,014
[clears throat] Come in, guys.

76
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:15,266
All right, take a seat.

77
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:17,143
Be right with you.

78
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:18,895
Here.

79
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:25,759
Is there a form or something
I should get them to fill out?

80
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,155
Uh, all the forms are
in the card-catalog room.

81
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:32,408
So...

82
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:34,577
Yep. There.

83
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:42,543
I told him to shoot if he heard anything,
and, uh, that's exactly what he did.

84
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,671
Uh, I-I thought it was a deer.

85
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:48,674
And that's when you saw
the girl... after you shot?

86
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:50,159
Yeah.

87
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,077
All right. What did she look like?

88
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:56,140
Indian. Uh, uh, Native American.

89
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:03,755
Uh, she had on a blue top
with, uh, flowers, I think,

90
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:06,859
and, uh, um, no pants.

91
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:11,387
Just a shirt and underwear.

92
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:12,514
[Zach] No pants, no shirt.

93
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:16,827
After I shot, she didn't
scream or anything.

94
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:21,582
And after she saw me, she took off running.

95
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,109
So I didn't think she was injured.

96
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,880
But... I just want to make sure.

97
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:29,673
You didn't call 911?

98
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,175
We are 911.

99
00:06:31,242 --> 00:06:32,492
We went to Fish and Game,

100
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:35,846
but they said since another person
was involved, we got to come to you.

101
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:40,143
All right, uh [clears throat] can
you show me where this happened?

102
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,352
[clears throat] Yeah, man.

103
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:48,151
Yeah. Let's see. It was
right... It was right there.

104
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:50,736
Yeah, right there. Yeah.

105
00:06:50,803 --> 00:06:52,071
[Ferg] Okay, thanks, guys.

106
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:54,931
We'll let you know if anything
turns up. Okay? Thank you.

107
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:56,284
[Zach] This way.

108
00:07:02,732 --> 00:07:06,085
Welcome to the exciting
life of an Absaroka deputy.

109
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,825
Standing Bear, I need a good lawyer.

110
00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:15,928
Can you put me in touch with Cady Longmire?

111
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:18,413
Happy to.

112
00:07:18,414 --> 00:07:20,641
- Cady?
- Yep?

113
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,981
- [May] Oh.
- What's going on?

114
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,861
Um, I need your help.

115
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:33,095
[sighs]

116
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:37,658
A neighbor of ours, Gabriella
Langton, was attacked.

117
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:40,977
Where is she? Is she okay?

118
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:43,789
She's outside in my car.
She didn't want to come in.

119
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:48,151
She ran to our house
after being out all night.

120
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:50,195
She was half-dressed and in shock.

121
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:52,131
What happened?

122
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:53,883
She was raped.

123
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:57,911
Okay, thanks.

124
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,289
Even the Crossroads Motel
is completely booked.

125
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,584
That is the fifth place I have tried with
no vacancy because of that damn casino.

126
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,878
You know what? I'm gonna
go check it out in person.

127
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,796
[Walt] Why?

128
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:11,567
Someone once told me that a face-to-face
interaction is better than a phone call.

129
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:22,102
Cady is in your office. We
came here with May Stillwater.

130
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:24,205
Is May's daughter in some kind of trouble?

131
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,999
Not her daughter, no.

132
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,836
Sheriff, this is Gab... Gabriella.

133
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:51,256
But we've called her Gab
since she was a little girl.

134
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:53,192
She was a chatterbox.

135
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:58,197
Always full of stories
and jokes, so "Gab" stuck.

136
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:00,950
Gab?

137
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:04,412
This is Sheriff Longmire.

138
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:09,833
Hi, there, Gab.

139
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:17,300
She grew up just down the street from me,
so I've known her for a long, long time.

140
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:19,343
[Henry] And I was her coach in high school.

141
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:23,764
She has got a killer hook shot.

142
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:33,065
Early this morning, Gab ran to our
house after being out all night.

143
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:41,740
She told my daughter Lilly
that... she was raped.

144
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:44,994
Gab, are you hurt?

145
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:54,527
May, did you take Gab to
the hospital or doctor?

146
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:57,423
Yes. First thing I did was take
her to the Res health clinic.

147
00:09:57,489 --> 00:10:01,552
And then I went to see Henry, 'cause
I knew we'd need a good lawyer.

148
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:05,889
And now we're here.

149
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:16,066
[sighs]

150
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:24,450
Gab, can you tell me
what happened last night?

151
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,712
You know, whatever happened...
it's not your fault.

152
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:44,261
Did you know the person
that did this to you?

153
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:54,480
Can you tell me what they looked like?

154
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:02,405
Gab, anything that you
can remember will help us.

155
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:07,868
I think he had a beard.

156
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:11,414
Can you tell me if he
was Indian or white or...

157
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:12,831
White.

158
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:18,921
Where did this happen?

159
00:11:18,988 --> 00:11:21,757
She said she was out at some party.

160
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:31,058
Did you know anybody at this party?

161
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:39,942
Where did the party happen?

162
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:47,199
Outside.

163
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:50,744
On the Res somewhere.

164
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:56,750
There was a bonfire.

165
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,711
You sure it was on the Res?

166
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:03,006
I think so.

167
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:13,725
[Walt] Gab, is there a
reason you didn't go home?

168
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:19,607
Is there a reason you
didn't tell your mother?

169
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:29,533
I shouldn't have told anyone.

170
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:34,037
[Cady] What do you think?

171
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:38,358
I don't have jurisdiction
on the Res, Pumpkin.

172
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:41,069
Based on what we heard in there,
you can't take it to trial, so...

173
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,446
No, I can't.

174
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:46,800
But I can help find a federal
prosecutor who will take the case.

175
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,803
I just need to get the feds
some convincing evidence.

176
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,972
Dad, I need an investigator.

177
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,082
Sheriff, sorry to interrupt.

178
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,186
Um, the girl who just left this
office matched a report I took earlier.

179
00:12:57,253 --> 00:13:00,213
Two hunters saw a barefoot
Native girl running in the woods.

180
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:03,400
Said she was only wearing a shirt, a
blue, flowery shirt like the girl had on.

181
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,594
- Where were they when they saw her?
- Uh, here.

182
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:06,945
Um...

183
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:12,951
Here.

184
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:18,356
That's not on the Res. Gab
wasn't raped on the Res.

185
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:20,083
I'll investigate this as my own case.

186
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,613
Cady, let's you and I head
over to the Res health clinic,

187
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:27,073
see if there's any physical
evidence that can help us.

188
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:30,034
Zach, you and Ferg head out
to where she was first sighted.

189
00:13:30,035 --> 00:13:32,012
Take the two hunters who saw her.

190
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,391
See if you can pinpoint
exactly where this happened.

191
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,767
Let's go, Punk.

192
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:50,822
[Cady] Thank God May took
Gab to the Res clinic.

193
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:54,350
I mean, with a rape kit, at least
we'll have some physical evidence.

194
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:58,163
That's good, 'cause Gab didn't
give us too much information.

195
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:03,025
Just give her a little time.
Then when she's ready, she'll...

196
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:05,128
She might not ever be ready.

197
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:08,257
You were really good with her.

198
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:12,803
If she'll talk to anyone,
it's gonna be to you.

199
00:14:15,998 --> 00:14:18,333
What's with the boxes?

200
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:21,628
[Walt] Vic got evicted.
I'm helping her move.

201
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,313
You are?

202
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:26,132
What about Sean?

203
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,902
Vic and Sean got divorced.

204
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:32,347
Oh, God.

205
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:33,865
Is she okay?

206
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:36,559
I wanted to ask you how you'd feel about,

207
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,163
uh, Vic staying in your
spare room temporarily.

208
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:46,819
Um, weird. [chuckles]

209
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,238
Yeah, I'd... I'd feel... I'd feel weird.

210
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:50,173
[Walt] Right.

211
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:53,451
[Cady] Can she stay in a hotel?

212
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:56,639
Well, she tried, but they're
all booked for the casino, so...

213
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,098
Can she stay with you?

214
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,850
No.

215
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:08,841
I wanted to wait, you
know, for a-a real doctor,

216
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:11,194
but Gab was too spooked.

217
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:12,345
She wasn't gonna wait.

218
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:16,116
And May, she insisted I do something, so...

219
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:25,900
So, yeah. So I did the best I could.

220
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:27,777
But...

221
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:29,254
[Walt] But what?

222
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:32,549
She had already taken a
shower before she got here.

223
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:36,411
And she was so embarrassed, you know?

224
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:39,372
She didn't want me to do anything.
She just wanted to go home.

225
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:42,041
[sighs] It was really difficult.

226
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,960
And the clinic doesn't
have any rape kits, so...

227
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:46,313
What?

228
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:49,692
We do the best we can with what we have.

229
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,259
I know all of the things...

230
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,114
uh, the procedures that you're supposed
to do in these types of situations.

231
00:15:56,181 --> 00:16:00,851
I thought I got it all,
but... after she left,

232
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:05,815
I realized that [sighs] I forgot to have
her undress on a sheet of white paper

233
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:10,528
so they could collect any hair,
lint, or any of that stuff.

234
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:14,550
Do you have anything,
any physical evidence?

235
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:18,220
No.

236
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:22,915
But I'm pretty sure...
pretty sure she was raped.

237
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,852
That's not gonna hold up in court.

238
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,127
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:28,337
I did the best I could
w-with everything that...

240
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:30,065
[sighs]

241
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:31,942
She was just so scared, you know?

242
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,348
[Ferg] You're sure she was
coming from this direction?

243
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:40,784
[Mitch] Pretty sure.

244
00:16:47,023 --> 00:16:49,776
Did you find the girl?

245
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:52,194
I'm not authorized to
give you that information.

246
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:53,756
Am I in trouble?

247
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,049
Should you be?

248
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,136
Looks like somebody
had a pretty good party.

249
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:13,859
You said the girl you saw was
wearing a blue blouse, right?

250
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,220
With flowers?

251
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:19,322
[Seth] Yeah.

252
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:22,242
What are you doing?

253
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:25,687
Can't go in there.

254
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:27,122
Why not?

255
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,458
Let me see the map.

256
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:33,336
You see this?

257
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:38,508
All this, it's all Res.

258
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,972
We have no jurisdiction
anywhere beyond this fence.

259
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,775
[May sighs]

260
00:17:57,427 --> 00:17:59,321
She's lying down.

261
00:18:00,222 --> 00:18:03,366
I'm gonna stay with her until
her mother comes home from work.

262
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:09,564
I could wait.

263
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:11,750
It's fine, Standing Bear.

264
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:16,922
Are we doing the right thing?

265
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:20,717
It is our duty to help.

266
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:25,830
It's just [sighs] I'm the one
who's pushing her to go after this.

267
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:28,017
You saw her with Walt.

268
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:30,143
She's...

269
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:32,879
[sighs]

270
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,315
All she wants is for this to go away.

271
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:38,944
Who am I to interfere? I'm not her mother.

272
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:45,349
All of these children belong to us.

273
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,786
We have to push to get justice.

274
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:51,959
Think about what happened
with your own daughter.

275
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:58,129
Gab is going to need help
to restore her spirit.

276
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,385
There is a sweat off Walsh Road...

277
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:06,930
for women and girls who have been... hurt.

278
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:10,350
Takes place every third Sunday.

279
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:12,877
A sweat?

280
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:14,063
Just for this?

281
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:17,524
How long has this been going on?

282
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:24,280
[sighs] Forever.

283
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:44,342
They changed the law recently.
They could have come to me.

284
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,847
No, they couldn't have.

285
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:53,292
A white man rapes a Native woman on the
Res and he's a boyfriend or a husband,

286
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:56,438
- it's within my jurisdiction.
- He's a stranger.

287
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:04,029
It happened on the Res,
so you can't do anything.

288
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:08,057
The rapist is white and a
stranger, so I can't do anything.

289
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:10,786
Neither one of us can
officially investigate this case.

290
00:20:10,853 --> 00:20:13,663
Cady's gonna take it
to a federal prosecutor.

291
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,791
Tsk. Yeah, good luck with that.

292
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,986
I told Cady I'd help.

293
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,737
She's not giving up on this one.

294
00:20:21,738 --> 00:20:25,425
She's, uh... She's stubborn like that.

295
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:31,056
She's gonna need some sort of case for
the feds to even consider taking this on.

296
00:20:32,457 --> 00:20:39,522
You know, uh... we could
cross-deputize each other.

297
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:46,155
So we'd each have jurisdiction in
each other's district, widen our reach.

298
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:50,224
If I give you authority on the Res,

299
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:53,978
we'll have to get everything
we need in less than two weeks.

300
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:57,415
'Cause that's how long I have
before I'm drummed out of a job.

301
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,358
Who leaves a $25 chip lying around?

302
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:28,571
White guys.

303
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:30,740
[indistinct conversations]

304
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:42,234
All right, Nighthorse agreed

305
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:45,529
to give me access to security
footage from last night.

306
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,655
Malachi is waiting.

307
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:48,950
Did you tell him I was with you?

308
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:50,426
I'm not stupid.

309
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,681
- Hey, Matty.
- Hey.

310
00:21:57,751 --> 00:21:59,728
[Malachi] So, Turner and Hooch,

311
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:03,606
I'm supposed to show you
last night's security footage.

312
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:05,883
You're supposed to show me.

313
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:07,610
I'm just on a ride-along.

314
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,262
We're looking for a victim.

315
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:12,615
We need to know if she was
here and who she was with.

316
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:17,037
Well, for the record, I told
Nighthorse to demand a warrant.

317
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:19,647
But he's a softie, so...

318
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,083
Stop, Malachi.

319
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,293
Stop right there. That one.

320
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,255
Go back, please.

321
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:29,925
Right there. You know those guys?

322
00:22:32,368 --> 00:22:33,595
Maybe.

323
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:36,723
Who are they?

324
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,417
You're the brain trust. You figure it out.

325
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:43,212
Cut the crap, Malachi. Tell us.

326
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:49,844
You know, Mathias, I believe you
arrested one of my guys... Curtis...

327
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:51,613
couple of days ago.

328
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,074
I think he didn't do it.

329
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,493
Curtis was a drunk and disorderly.

330
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,788
Oh, well, that's a matter of opinion.

331
00:23:02,565 --> 00:23:05,543
[Mathias] If I release him,
you'll tell us who these men are?

332
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,006
- Deal.
- [scoffs]

333
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:17,013
Yeah, these guys work in
the oil fields in Odin.

334
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,057
Started coming in here on their days off.

335
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,852
Like craps, love poker.

336
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,630
I'm happy to print you out some
stills if that would be any help.

337
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:29,901
You're sticking your nose
in where it doesn't belong!

338
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:31,385
Linda, I am just trying to help!

339
00:23:31,386 --> 00:23:33,595
If something happened to
Lilly, I would want you to...

340
00:23:33,596 --> 00:23:35,490
[Linda] Want me to mind
my own damn business!

341
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:36,640
[sighs]

342
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:40,120
My daughter is in there
traumatized by what you made her do.

343
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:44,023
Ms. Langton, I'm Sheriff Longmire.

344
00:23:44,024 --> 00:23:47,044
What are you doing here? I thought
Mathias is the one who's supposed to...

345
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,361
Mathias and I are working
together on this one.

346
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,405
Ms. Stillwater is just trying to help.

347
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:53,574
Gab and I don't need any help.

348
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:56,744
Ms. Langton, we want to find this
man. We want justice for your daughter.

349
00:23:56,745 --> 00:24:02,750
Go... Go inside and look at my
daughter curled up on that couch,

350
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:08,089
shaking like a leaf, too
scared to say anything!

351
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,068
And then I dare you to tell
me that justice can help us!

352
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,905
Go. You heard me.

353
00:24:17,432 --> 00:24:18,908
Go right ahead.

354
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:31,046
[shoes scraping]

355
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:51,900
Gab, uh, well... [sighs]

356
00:24:53,302 --> 00:24:55,928
I understand that you were
at the casino last night.

357
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:58,513
- The casino?
- No, I wasn't at the casino.

358
00:24:58,514 --> 00:25:01,743
Gab... these were pulled
from last night's security.

359
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:05,038
[Linda] You can't pay me
so much as a nickel in rent,

360
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:07,564
and you're putting money into the slots?

361
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:09,667
Where are you getting the cash, Gabriella?

362
00:25:09,734 --> 00:25:12,486
- [Walt] Ms. Langton, please.
- [Linda] She can't seem to find a job,

363
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:14,113
so she has to live here with me.

364
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:19,469
And while I am working myself to
death, scrubbing motel toilets,

365
00:25:19,535 --> 00:25:22,013
she's out just throwing money away?

366
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,181
And you lie about it?

367
00:25:23,248 --> 00:25:27,518
Ms. Langton, May, can I just
have a minute alone with Gab?

368
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:29,396
Come on.

369
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:33,316
What else am I gonna find out, huh,
that you were wearing brand-new boots?

370
00:25:33,383 --> 00:25:34,317
Linda. Come on!

371
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,112
[Linda] I need a drink.

372
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:53,402
Gab...

373
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:57,673
is the man who attacked
you... in this photo?

374
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,516
Can you point to him?

375
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,289
So, there were two?

376
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:35,545
But you're sure these are the guys?

377
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:43,428
Okay.

378
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:54,897
[engines shut off]

379
00:26:59,594 --> 00:27:02,155
I'll hang back in case anyone runs.

380
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:14,334
[Walt] Where can I find these two guys?

381
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:18,588
What the hell, man?!

382
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:22,008
[Walt] I'm gonna ask you again.

383
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:25,136
- Where can I find these guys?
- They're in that one right there.

384
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:27,680
Ferg.

385
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:33,269
Sheriff's Department!

386
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:37,232
The hell are you?

387
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,902
Get off me, man.

388
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,532
Come here.

389
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:48,410
Get up! Get the hell up!

390
00:27:48,477 --> 00:27:49,937
- Get the hell up!
- What the hell?

391
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:52,622
- On your feet!
- [indistinct shouting]

392
00:27:52,688 --> 00:27:54,416
Don't move!

393
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:55,584
Shut up.

394
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,751
- Got him?
- Got him.

395
00:27:56,818 --> 00:27:58,628
Let's go.

396
00:27:58,694 --> 00:28:00,171
Out. All right, let's go.

397
00:28:06,328 --> 00:28:08,763
Ferg, phone.

398
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,843
Hey, Punk, we got two suspects in custody.

399
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:25,929
I'll hold them while you meet
with the federal prosecutor.

400
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,365
Yeah. Good luck.

401
00:28:44,949 --> 00:28:46,676
Sheriff Longmire.

402
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:50,704
Walker Browning. Heard you
arrested a couple of my guys.

403
00:28:50,705 --> 00:28:53,475
I had to come down here
and see what was what.

404
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:55,250
You with the oil company?

405
00:28:55,251 --> 00:28:58,480
I'm their representative till the
company's lawyers can get here.

406
00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:01,882
Oh, you don't have to go, sugar?

407
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:04,777
I'm sure me and you can share
that little bed just fine.

408
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:08,096
You shut your goddamn mouth! You hear me?!

409
00:29:08,097 --> 00:29:09,348
[grunts] Do you hear me?!

410
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:11,951
Yeah, yeah, man. I hear you.

411
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:23,028
Sheriff, these are good guys.

412
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:25,906
No drugs, clean records,
report to work on time.

413
00:29:25,907 --> 00:29:27,342
They do a hell of a job.

414
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,721
When their leave rolls around,
yeah, they like to have a good time.

415
00:29:31,746 --> 00:29:34,373
Got to blow off some steam.
You know how that goes.

416
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:36,476
But rape? You got to be kidding me.

417
00:29:37,335 --> 00:29:40,254
Now, where did this supposedly happen?

418
00:29:40,255 --> 00:29:44,651
At a party in the woods,
a place near, uh...

419
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:46,927
Yeah. Near Eberwine
Creek. I know the place.

420
00:29:46,928 --> 00:29:49,739
The guys sometimes build a
fire and party over there.

421
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:53,951
Oh, they can be loud, shooting off
firecrackers, all that horse shit.

422
00:29:56,729 --> 00:30:00,791
That, uh, area, the clearing where
they hang out, isn't that on the Res?

423
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:04,170
That's right.

424
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,449
Okay, uh, as far as I know,

425
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,094
only tribal police have
jurisdiction on the Res.

426
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:19,185
I'm holding the suspects... your guys...
till the federal prosecutor gets here.

427
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:22,630
The feds?

428
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:23,898
Damn.

429
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:31,155
You must have some pretty
compelling evidence against them.

430
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:35,368
God damn it!

431
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:39,247
Okay, I take pride in my guys.

432
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:42,833
God damn it.

433
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:50,966
Look, if they really did this...

434
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,430
throw the book at them.

435
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:08,467
Ms. Longmire, the lack of
a hospital-issued rape kit

436
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:11,720
and any DNA evidence, on top of the
unreliability of the victim's account,

437
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:14,616
already make it almost impossible to try.

438
00:31:14,683 --> 00:31:18,644
I wish it were different, but... we
can't throw money at a lost cause.

439
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:21,790
Gab deserves more.
These women deserve more.

440
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,442
You know, Ms. Longmire, earlier this year,
the Violence Against Women Act was passed.

441
00:31:25,443 --> 00:31:27,277
If Gabriella's attacker
was her boyfriend...

442
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,840
She didn't know her
rapists. They were strangers.

443
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:32,366
They?

444
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:34,868
[Cady] Gab was raped by two
different men, Mrs. Bradley...

445
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:37,954
oil-rig workers that
she was partying with.

446
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:39,140
Oil-rig workers?

447
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:44,520
I had the exact situation
happen in North Dakota.

448
00:31:44,587 --> 00:31:47,756
Guys from the Bakken shale
fields raping girls on the Res

449
00:31:47,757 --> 00:31:49,692
because they knew they
could get away with it.

450
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:52,594
Mrs. Bradley, if these guys know

451
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:56,616
there will never even be an attempt
to stop them, they will keep doing it.

452
00:31:56,683 --> 00:32:00,143
But a federal prosecutor investigating,
even if it doesn't go to trial,

453
00:32:00,144 --> 00:32:01,746
may serve as a disincentive.

454
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:06,334
They have to know that
there are consequences.

455
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:10,779
[Cady] This is really good, Dad.

456
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,656
I think she's gonna
consider taking the case.

457
00:32:12,657 --> 00:32:14,592
I mean, this is a huge deal.

458
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:18,763
Of course, Gab is gonna
have to meet with her.

459
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:22,207
She's gonna need a detailed
first-person account of the assault.

460
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:26,646
Hopefully, Gab can give
her some, you know, details.

461
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:31,633
Also, the prosecutor is going to
bring a sexual-assault nurse examiner,

462
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:34,553
'cause they can do a rape kit
up to 72 hours after the assault,

463
00:32:34,554 --> 00:32:36,054
and it's still admissible in court.

464
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:38,073
Gab is gonna have to go
through all that again?

465
00:32:39,183 --> 00:32:40,892
It's the only way.

466
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:43,329
I mean, the Res-clinic
exam isn't gonna cut it.

467
00:32:45,565 --> 00:32:49,919
And I was hoping that maybe
you could bring it up with Gab.

468
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:51,170
Me?

469
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:53,071
Normally, I'd say that
a woman should do it,

470
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:59,053
but in this case, I mean, you're the
only one she really responded to earlier.

471
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,431
You're really good with her, Dad.

472
00:33:03,374 --> 00:33:05,518
You treat her like you treat me.

473
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:11,858
You know, I always assumed that you
had to be really tough for your job.

474
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:17,488
Never occurred to me
that you were... just you.

475
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:31,252
I thought about it, and I'd be happy
to have Vic stay with me for a while.

476
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:36,382
Yeah.

477
00:33:41,663 --> 00:33:43,222
[engine shuts off]

478
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:45,915
She's gone!

479
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,685
[Walt] Ms. Langton, just take a breath.

480
00:33:47,752 --> 00:33:50,253
You! You scared her off.

481
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:52,339
- She's run away!
- Gab ran away?

482
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,816
[Linda] Of course she ran away.

483
00:33:53,883 --> 00:33:55,843
You people scared her off.

484
00:33:55,844 --> 00:33:59,262
She's terrified of you guys
poking and prodding at her.

485
00:33:59,263 --> 00:34:00,889
Ms. Langton, what happened?

486
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:05,954
Said that she was gonna meet me at the
Blind Tiger, but she never showed up.

487
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,330
And since they don't got
a phone, I couldn't call,

488
00:34:08,397 --> 00:34:12,961
so I walked over here, and Ms. Langton
said that she had left an hour before.

489
00:34:13,027 --> 00:34:14,944
Leave.

490
00:34:14,945 --> 00:34:17,214
And don't come back.

491
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:19,508
We're done here.

492
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:36,525
[rock music playing]

493
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:41,697
[Walt] Cady found a federal prosecutor.

494
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:45,141
We can't find the victim.

495
00:34:45,142 --> 00:34:47,101
So I need your help, Henry.

496
00:34:47,102 --> 00:34:49,354
I will get a cover for my
shift, and I will meet you...

497
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:51,791
[Malachi] It's not surprising
that the girl ran away.

498
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:55,795
She knows she's not gonna see any justice.

499
00:34:58,614 --> 00:35:01,216
- [glass thuds]
- Ah.

500
00:35:01,826 --> 00:35:04,870
Oliphant vs. Suquamish, 1978,

501
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:09,123
stripped the tribe of its rights
to arrest and prosecute non-Indians.

502
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:13,062
I guess you was scared we would,
uh, scalp you if we got some power.

503
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:15,129
But you did get power.

504
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,941
[Malachi] Not the right power, Walter.

505
00:35:17,007 --> 00:35:21,487
See, when a white man hands you a law,
you have to pay attention to the loopholes.

506
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:25,724
See, they figured if a
white man was stupid enough

507
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:31,080
to date or marry an Indian girl,
he has to suffer the consequences.

508
00:35:31,146 --> 00:35:34,900
But all other non-Natives
are still protected,

509
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:37,419
so we're right back where we started.

510
00:35:37,486 --> 00:35:38,695
We are not back where we...

511
00:35:38,696 --> 00:35:41,448
[Malachi] All you ever did was shame a girl

512
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:43,217
and cause a mother to lose her daughter.

513
00:35:43,284 --> 00:35:46,261
At least when I was in
charge, we had some justice.

514
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:47,262
[scoffs]

515
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:54,687
Oh, and, uh, Hank... you
can't get out of your shift.

516
00:35:54,754 --> 00:35:56,939
You've missed too much work already.

517
00:35:57,006 --> 00:35:58,733
[laughs]

518
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:04,446
[sighs, grunts]

519
00:36:08,935 --> 00:36:10,369
Hi.

520
00:36:12,772 --> 00:36:15,207
Your dad told me that he
talked to you about this.

521
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:16,584
He did. He did.

522
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:19,670
Um, it's fine. Come in.

523
00:36:19,737 --> 00:36:21,589
- Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

524
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:23,448
Come in, come in. You can put that down.

525
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,467
- Okay.
- Uh, right there.

526
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,623
[sighs]

527
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:35,937
Um, I'm, uh... I'm really sorry.

528
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:41,609
My dad told me that you...
well, about the divorce.

529
00:36:41,676 --> 00:36:43,259
Yeah.

530
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,863
That. [chuckles]

531
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:49,033
[clears throat]

532
00:36:50,852 --> 00:36:53,436
Well, this... This is the guest room...

533
00:36:53,437 --> 00:36:55,605
- Okay.
- ...where you will be staying.

534
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:56,606
[chuckles]

535
00:36:56,607 --> 00:36:57,875
[Vic] Great.

536
00:36:59,735 --> 00:37:03,714
Thank you. Just, um... Just
until a hotel room opens up.

537
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:07,617
Stay as long as you want. Really.

538
00:37:07,618 --> 00:37:11,305
Absaroka can be tough on us single ladies.

539
00:37:11,372 --> 00:37:13,182
Yeah. [laughs]

540
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,186
Do you have any food or
anything? You want to...

541
00:37:17,252 --> 00:37:19,688
Come on. [laughs]

542
00:37:27,638 --> 00:37:28,697
[Vic] Hey!

543
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:32,183
I'm sorry. I tried to stop them.

544
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:34,686
Gab didn't run away. She was kidnapped.

545
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:38,248
Linda found this ransom note
in her mailbox this morning.

546
00:37:38,315 --> 00:37:40,817
It says that Gab will only be released

547
00:37:40,818 --> 00:37:43,212
if all rape charges against
those oil workers are dropped.

548
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:46,256
I ran to May's to get her to drive me here.

549
00:37:46,323 --> 00:37:48,342
Please, Sheriff.

550
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:50,011
Please find my daughter.

551
00:37:50,078 --> 00:37:54,807
Ms. Langton, Vic will stay with you
in case they try to contact you again.

552
00:37:54,874 --> 00:37:57,333
I'm not going back to the house.

553
00:37:57,334 --> 00:37:59,687
It's okay, Ms. Langton, you'll
be safe. I'll be with you.

554
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:02,606
I was supposed to be
at work 30 minutes ago.

555
00:38:02,673 --> 00:38:05,693
If I don't get on a bus right
now, I'm gonna be an hour late.

556
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:10,447
Vic, um, go to the Langton
house and stay posted there.

557
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:12,741
We're gonna find Gab.

558
00:38:12,808 --> 00:38:16,204
Linda, I'll drive you to the motel.
That way, you won't have to take the bus.

559
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:24,694
Do we even have the right guys in custody,

560
00:38:24,695 --> 00:38:27,422
or are the real rapists still
out there holding Gab hostage?

561
00:38:34,997 --> 00:38:35,931
[Walt] Let's go.

562
00:38:57,895 --> 00:39:00,147
[laughs]

563
00:39:00,148 --> 00:39:01,249
[clears throat]

564
00:39:13,077 --> 00:39:15,369
Ferg, Zach, trail them.

565
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,848
See where they take you,
who they take you to.

566
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:20,184
I'll have Ruby put a flag on both of them.

567
00:39:21,085 --> 00:39:22,978
I'm gonna follow a different lead.

568
00:39:29,218 --> 00:39:31,653
I can't help you, man.
I don't know anything.

569
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:35,074
[Walt] I think you can help me, actually.

570
00:39:35,808 --> 00:39:38,077
You were with Gab that night at the casino.

571
00:39:40,104 --> 00:39:43,898
Listen, I know Gab's mom was pissed
off that we were at the casino,

572
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:48,503
but if I had to live in that house with
that bitch, I'd want to run away, too.

573
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,840
Gab didn't run away,
Mandy. She was kidnapped.

574
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:55,261
I believe she was kidnapped
by one of these men.

575
00:39:56,204 --> 00:39:58,806
I believe these are also
the men that raped her.

576
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:01,976
Now, you weren't there
for Gab when she was raped.

577
00:40:02,043 --> 00:40:05,187
How about you be there for her
now, before she gets killed?

578
00:40:06,005 --> 00:40:07,356
I met Will and Tyler.

579
00:40:07,422 --> 00:40:08,816
Who are these guys?

580
00:40:08,883 --> 00:40:10,776
I need names.

581
00:40:12,344 --> 00:40:13,570
The only one I know is him.

582
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:16,264
Partied with him before.

583
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:18,826
The other guys, they're new,
but it was always the same party.

584
00:40:18,893 --> 00:40:23,521
They would buy us drinks, give us
chips, and we'd have a good time.

585
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:25,333
Thought Gab needed a break from that bitch,

586
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:28,710
so I brought her along with me, and
I thought that she would have fun.

587
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:33,948
That guy, he didn't touch Gab.

588
00:40:33,949 --> 00:40:37,136
Not today, not yesterday, nothing.

589
00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:39,680
And I know that for sure.

590
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:41,974
Why for sure?

591
00:40:45,211 --> 00:40:47,188
'Cause he was with me.

592
00:40:47,255 --> 00:40:48,480
Where?

593
00:40:51,092 --> 00:40:52,234
His place.

594
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:54,135
The barracks?

595
00:40:54,136 --> 00:40:55,988
With eight guys to a room?

596
00:40:56,055 --> 00:40:59,449
No. His little spot.

597
00:41:00,851 --> 00:41:02,703
His unit.

598
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,980
- His storage unit?
- [lighter clicking]

599
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:07,916
When exactly were you with him?

600
00:41:07,983 --> 00:41:10,669
That night until yesterday afternoon.

601
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:13,672
This guy you were with, what's his name?

602
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:15,590
I don't know.

603
00:41:15,657 --> 00:41:16,717
You don't know?

604
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:19,702
No, I don't know.

605
00:41:19,703 --> 00:41:21,013
And I don't want to know.

606
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:25,416
You know, my mother always told me to
keep my mouth shut and never name names,

607
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:27,144
and now I know why.

608
00:41:29,297 --> 00:41:31,940
Look what happened to Gab
after she said something, huh?

609
00:41:35,844 --> 00:41:38,739
And now no one is gonna
do anything about it.

610
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:41,033
What am I doing here?

611
00:41:44,353 --> 00:41:47,772
[Ferg] You know, I mean, that's why I
like using my personal vehicle for work.

612
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:50,876
It's just great for surveillance.

613
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:54,129
It's just not your typical,
you know, unmarked car.

614
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:02,971
Hey.

615
00:42:03,038 --> 00:42:05,206
What are you doing?

616
00:42:05,207 --> 00:42:06,141
Zach?

617
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,603
Zach!

618
00:42:16,844 --> 00:42:18,303
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

619
00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:20,388
I'm getting photos that
we can show our next victim

620
00:42:20,389 --> 00:42:24,076
so she can identify her rapist,
'cause I know it's gonna happen again.

621
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,996
And I know it's gonna
be one of you assholes.

622
00:42:43,578 --> 00:42:45,013
Hey! Hey!

623
00:42:52,171 --> 00:42:53,105
Come on.

624
00:42:53,714 --> 00:42:55,065
Come on!

625
00:43:04,808 --> 00:43:07,077
So, what happened out there, Ferg?

626
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:12,582
Sheriff... I'm gonna be honest with you.

627
00:43:16,111 --> 00:43:18,672
I'm not so sure about this new guy.

628
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:20,590
He pushes too hard.

629
00:43:21,658 --> 00:43:26,013
He was provoking those guys
at the camp, filming them.

630
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,140
And what did you do?

631
00:43:28,207 --> 00:43:32,019
I just tried to stay out of the way.

632
00:43:32,086 --> 00:43:33,479
I expect better of you.

633
00:43:33,545 --> 00:43:35,796
You're the senior deputy.

634
00:43:35,797 --> 00:43:39,276
If you thought he was doing the wrong
thing, you should have stopped it.

635
00:43:39,343 --> 00:43:41,529
So, was Zachary out of line?

636
00:43:42,596 --> 00:43:45,491
Do you need to file a report
of inappropriate behavior?

637
00:43:48,143 --> 00:43:49,411
No.

638
00:43:51,855 --> 00:43:52,998
No.

639
00:43:54,608 --> 00:43:57,044
[Zach] Sheriff, you got to come see this.

640
00:44:12,876 --> 00:44:17,231
This guy here... matches the casino still.

641
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:25,138
[Ferg] Do you think this guy could
be involved in the rape, Sheriff?

642
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:26,615
[Zach] Or the kidnapping?

643
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:29,743
[Walt] We'll know soon enough.

644
00:44:31,061 --> 00:44:34,939
Hey. So, it's been dead quiet here.

645
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,485
Linda is still at work, and there's
no sign of Gab or anybody else.

646
00:44:38,486 --> 00:44:39,777
Where you at?

647
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:41,255
[Walt] Hammond Storage,

648
00:44:41,322 --> 00:44:46,009
following up on something I saw in a video
Zachary shot at the oil-company barracks.

649
00:44:49,037 --> 00:44:51,831
You know, if you tell me
what you're looking for,

650
00:44:51,832 --> 00:44:54,101
I can help you find it a whole lot easier.

651
00:44:54,168 --> 00:44:56,562
[Walt] I just need to take
a look at all the lockers

652
00:44:56,628 --> 00:44:58,421
rented by employees of that oil company.

653
00:44:58,422 --> 00:45:00,482
- Where's the next one?
- [sighs] Back there.

654
00:45:03,344 --> 00:45:04,986
[sighing]

655
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:23,297
There you go. More of the same.

656
00:45:24,656 --> 00:45:27,509
Who rents that one? Different lock.

657
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,162
Huh.

658
00:45:31,163 --> 00:45:33,682
That's strange. I don't, uh...

659
00:45:33,748 --> 00:45:37,018
I don't have a record of this
unit being rented out this month.

660
00:45:37,085 --> 00:45:39,062
Number 11.

661
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:43,383
Eight... Nine... Ten.

662
00:45:43,384 --> 00:45:45,486
Oh, 11 there.

663
00:45:54,353 --> 00:45:56,246
It said "11" right on the key.

664
00:45:56,313 --> 00:45:57,956
That's the right key.

665
00:46:04,112 --> 00:46:05,905
It's just the wrong lock.

666
00:46:05,906 --> 00:46:07,132
Stay back, Bart.

667
00:46:18,793 --> 00:46:21,313
[breathing heavily]

668
00:46:22,172 --> 00:46:24,149
[muffled sobbing]

669
00:47:10,387 --> 00:47:13,031
[Cady] Did she recognize her kidnappers?

670
00:47:13,098 --> 00:47:17,101
No. There were two of them wearing
masks when she was abducted.

671
00:47:17,102 --> 00:47:18,978
But the good news is that Gab and her mom

672
00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:21,122
aren't gonna be pressured
into dropping the charges.

673
00:47:21,189 --> 00:47:23,625
Well, we probably have a
stronger case now than ever.

674
00:47:23,692 --> 00:47:25,151
Where is Mrs. Langton?

675
00:47:25,152 --> 00:47:26,545
In Gab's room.

676
00:47:30,407 --> 00:47:31,592
How is she?

677
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:34,595
Okay.

678
00:47:34,662 --> 00:47:37,264
Ms. Langton, the last thing
we want to do is push you.

679
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:40,434
[Cady] Listen, the federal
prosecutor is ready to file on this,

680
00:47:40,501 --> 00:47:41,959
but not until she speaks with Gab.

681
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,521
So if you could please let us
know when Gab is ready to talk.

682
00:47:44,588 --> 00:47:48,024
Oh, I can tell you right
now... Gab isn't gonna talk.

683
00:47:49,343 --> 00:47:51,695
But in order to move
forward with the case...

684
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:54,573
There is no case. Gab
is not pressing charges.

685
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,242
There's no more ransom. I found her.

686
00:47:57,309 --> 00:48:02,330
Good for you, since you were the
reason she was taken in the first place.

687
00:48:02,397 --> 00:48:05,566
Listen, the feds rarely
pursue cases like this.

688
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:09,129
- The fact that they are is encouraging.
- Are the Feds gonna pay my rent?

689
00:48:09,196 --> 00:48:11,548
'Cause I don't need justice.

690
00:48:11,615 --> 00:48:13,425
I need to pay the rent.

691
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,994
Yeah.

692
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:20,098
Did someone, uh, come to see you at work?

693
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,769
They pay you to drop the charges?

694
00:48:24,919 --> 00:48:30,317
Buy you a new phone...
a couple months' rent?

695
00:48:33,178 --> 00:48:37,449
A lot of bad things happen
to a lot of women out here.

696
00:48:39,142 --> 00:48:43,455
At least my daughter had the good
luck to be raped by a white guy.

697
00:48:48,402 --> 00:48:49,860
You can't do this.

698
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:52,988
You have your picture of justice.

699
00:48:52,989 --> 00:48:54,257
I have mine.

700
00:48:54,324 --> 00:48:55,425
Who paid you?

701
00:48:55,492 --> 00:49:00,221
Women on the Res are taught
to keep their mouths shut.

702
00:49:00,288 --> 00:49:04,976
That's what my mother taught me,
and that's what I tried to teach Gab.

703
00:49:06,336 --> 00:49:09,630
Thank you. Thank you all.

704
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:15,737
Because with your help... I
think that she finally learned.

705
00:49:22,686 --> 00:49:24,078
Goodbye.

706
00:49:27,733 --> 00:49:29,334
Bye-bye.

707
00:49:43,582 --> 00:49:45,893
That sucked.

708
00:49:48,044 --> 00:49:49,145
[sighs]

709
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:29,477
[women singing in native language]

710
00:51:10,752 --> 00:51:12,353
[woman] Gab...

711
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:17,966
or as the spirits know you...

712
00:51:17,967 --> 00:51:20,111
Morning Star.

713
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:25,241
A part of you was taken away.

714
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:31,957
Someone took what did not belong to them.

715
00:51:33,942 --> 00:51:38,505
That part of you is now wandering...

716
00:51:38,572 --> 00:51:40,632
and lost.

717
00:51:44,452 --> 00:51:50,141
This is why you feel...
like you don't belong.

718
00:51:56,381 --> 00:52:00,527
I'm now going to call
that part of you back.

719
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:06,199
[pot clanks]

720
00:52:08,727 --> 00:52:12,605
Come back, Morning Star.

721
00:52:12,606 --> 00:52:15,357
[women singing in native language]

722
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:19,629
Come back, Morning Star.

723
00:52:21,448 --> 00:52:26,201
Come back, Morning Star.

724
00:52:26,202 --> 00:52:27,620
[indistinct talking]

725
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:31,707
[voice breaking] Come back, Morning Star.

726
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:34,268
[ululating]

727
00:52:46,014 --> 00:52:48,700
Morning Star...

728
00:52:49,726 --> 00:52:52,286
call yourself back.

729
00:52:59,736 --> 00:53:02,005
[breathing heavily]

730
00:53:10,872 --> 00:53:15,918
Come back, Morning Star.

731
00:53:15,919 --> 00:53:18,146
[sobbing]

732
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:32,827
[women singing softly in native language]

733
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:05,526
[Henry] May?

734
00:54:06,928 --> 00:54:08,888
This can't be how it ends.

735
00:54:08,889 --> 00:54:11,074
I won't stand for it.

736
00:54:13,393 --> 00:54:14,786
Where are you going?

737
00:54:16,479 --> 00:54:20,708
I'm gonna leave a note... for Hector.

738
