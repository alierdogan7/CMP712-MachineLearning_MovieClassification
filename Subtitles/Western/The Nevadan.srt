1
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,518
- Morning, son.
- Morning.

2
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,349
We're off course.
Know the old mine around here?

3
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,836
- There's a lot of them here.
- It's worked by a man named Sand.

4
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,838
- Samuel Sand.
- He's my father.

5
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,996
You don't say, boy.

6
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,237
Your pa hunted buffalo
with me in the army.

7
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,796
We thought it only decent
to stop by and say howdy.

8
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,232
Three miles on, second canyon,
head west. You'll see.

9
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,190
- You have a first name?
- Max.

10
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,391
Much obliged, Max.

11
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,474
You keep out of this, squaw.

12
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,758
- Now, where is the gold? Tell me.
- Take it easy.

13
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,319
Come on, Sam.

14
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,751
Sam, ain't no use holding out.

15
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,793
There's no gold, Jesse.
When will you get it?

16
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,197
Now, look,
you're working a so-called dead mine.

17
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,676
- You found something.
- Would I be living like this?

18
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,031
- We don't want it all, just half.
- Of nothing.

19
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,198
You've been sprinkling gold dust
like snow.

20
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,518
- $1 a day's worth.
- You paid the store with a gold nugget.

21
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,840
It's been two years, one nugget. $38.
Wouldn't even pay for the shovels.

22
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,235
We didn't ride this far to argue.

23
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,468
You're going to tell us where it is,
if you tell us with your dying breath.

24
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,636
Whoa, boy, easy.

25
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,358
Ain't that handsome beadwork?
You fashion 'em yourself, squaw?

26
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,910
It's 1 5 years since I skinned an lndian,
Squaw Man,

27
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,475
but I ain't forgot the way.

28
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,719
Leave her be! Please, leave her be.

29
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,196
I tell you, there ain't any gold.
I swear it, none.

30
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,072
I'm not afraid.

31
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,836
Max...

32
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,996
They're both dead.

33
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,553
There's nothing you can do now. Max!

34
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,751
Max, stay outta there.
God, please stay out.

35
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,192
Come into town with me.

36
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,480
They don't even look like people.

37
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,716
Their suffering's over.

38
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,195
I don't want anybody to see them
looking like that. Ever.

39
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,556
Go away. Leave me alone. Please.

40
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,753
My God.

41
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,359
Max, you poor child.

42
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,235
- You come live with us. I mean it.
- I can't.

43
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,352
We've got acres of land
and plenty of work.

44
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,518
- I've got to find those men.
- And if you do?

45
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,552
- Revenge isn't God's way.
- Save your preaching.

46
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,479
You're only a boy, they're vicious men.

47
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,319
Get 'em, Max. You go get 'em.

48
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,431
If he doesn't, who will?

49
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,995
- The law.
- What law?

50
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,872
Max, at least wait a day. Rest up.

51
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,152
Maybe I can get 'em
before they sell that horse.

52
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,873
Here... Here, Max.

53
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,837
Mrs McCanles, I got a rifle,
a horse and $8. It'll hold.

54
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,477
Well, then, good luck.
Don't forget the way back.

55
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,399
I'll remember you both
for your kindness.

56
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,153
Who the hell are you?

57
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,828
My name is Max. Max Sand.

58
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,235
- Just a kid.
- Indian.

59
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,795
- Half-breed.
- You alone?

60
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,479
Spit it out.

61
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,433
I'm after three men
who killed my parents.

62
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,632
- I thought you were the ones.
- Are we?

63
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,439
No.

64
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,952
- How long have you been tracking 'em?
- Three, four days.

65
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,869
- When did you eat last?
- A couple of days ago.

66
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,194
Pick up the horses, then join us.

67
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,951
Hey, kid, why don't you go home?

68
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,515
While you still have a chance.

69
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,790
I don't have a home.

70
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,431
How can you guys be so friendly...
after what I tried to do?

71
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,871
Everybody in this world's foolish
in his own way.

72
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,279
Besides, we were all kids once
ourselves, weren't we, now?

73
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,996
Don't move, mister.

74
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,198
Now, turn around, with your hands up.

75
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,120
All I want is some food and a horse.

76
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,949
- I haven't seen a gun like that in years.
- Keep away.

77
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,232
- It won't work, you know.
- I said stay back.

78
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,431
The barrel's rusted, the hammer's broke
and they don't make ammunition for it.

79
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,956
You wanna trade?

80
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,116
I could use something to eat.

81
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:24,152
You've eaten about 25 pounds of food in
three days. Think you'll ever get filled up?

82
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,273
Sorry, I didn't think.
I know it's a long way to haul food.

83
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,710
- Well, finish it up, if you can.
- I can.

84
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,389
I didn't expect you to be so generous.

85
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,718
- Think I'd throw you to the coyotes?
- You had every right.

86
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,150
I meant to kill you if I had to.

87
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,317
You an old hand at killing?

88
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,910
I killed my share of deer and rabbits.

89
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,079
- Ever hold a gun on a man?
- No.

90
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,319
You mean to kill three of 'em, huh?
Bang, bang, bang.

91
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,672
You'll make it 'cause you're in the right?

92
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,271
- It helps.
- They bury a sheriff a week out here.

93
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,072
I figure it's a matter
of me killing them before they kill me.

94
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,312
You wanna show me
this fancy gun work?

95
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,671
Turn around and face the sun.

96
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,153
Hit that.

97
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,194
Go on home, boy. Take the short cut.

98
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,198
The sun was in my eyes
and I wasn't ready.

99
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,599
Think a man will hold still and give you
warning so you can shoot at him?

100
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,395
- I can hit a rabbit at 80 yards.
- It don't shoot.

101
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,799
- Think you can use your rifle in a bar?
- I've never been in a bar.

102
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,429
Just to find 'em,
you'll have to comb out every saloon,

103
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,918
gambling hall and whorehouse
between here and Mexico.

104
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,953
Do you think you're after
three preachers?

105
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,675
You gonna gun 'em down
coming out of a church social?

106
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,032
They steal 'cause they're too lazy to work
and kill 'cause they love to.

107
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,638
They hide out like rats in the garbage.

108
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,472
So if you're gonna get 'em, you'll have to
wallow in that garbage right with them.

109
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,158
I'll do what I have to.

110
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,070
It ain't that easy. Finding them's
one thing, killing them's another.

111
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,589
I'll figure out ways.

112
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,356
I've been selling guns
to men like that for 1 5 years.

113
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,951
They've got more ways to cripple
and kill than you can dream of.

114
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,790
They'll shoot you in the back,
ambush you, kill you in your sleep.

115
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,955
All you've got
is some blind lndian revenge.

116
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,915
- I'm half white.
- You're all helpless.

117
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,318
You get so you can do that
with either hand,

118
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,829
when you're half-drunk, half-awake,

119
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,068
in a dark room or on a running horse,
you might stand a chance.

120
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,350
A small chance.

121
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,949
- Would you teach me?
- I sell guns. I don't teach killing.

122
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,596
- Then I'll learn myself.
- You won't live that long.

123
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,714
Thanks for the food and advice, Mr Cord.

124
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,878
- I guess I'll be on my way.
- Where to? How?

125
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,436
Even if I did teach you,
that's only half of it.

126
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,712
While you're looking for them,
you gotta eat.

127
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,074
You need clothes, food, horses, guns,
ammunition. How you gonna get that?

128
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:51,038
You'll wind up stealing and killing like
the ones you're tracking, can't you see?

129
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,791
I don't see nothing except
my father lying on a blood-covered floor,

130
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,390
all burnt and cut
with his head blown to pieces.

131
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,199
And my mother, split up the middle,
and every inch of her skin ripped off.

132
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,914
God help us.

133
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,071
Pick up that brass. Cartridges cost
a cent-and-a-half apiece.

134
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,798
Sit down.

135
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,796
A little poker suit you?

136
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,872
Well, not too much.

137
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,118
- You know how to play cards, don't you?
- No.

138
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,599
I guess I can teach you.
Have a drink.

139
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,872
Well, I...

140
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,389
- You don't drink either?
- No.

141
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,874
Where you're going, you'd best learn.

142
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,549
The lowest hand you can get is a pair,
two of a kind.

143
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,234
Then two pair, then three of a kind,

144
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,953
then a straight.

145
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,434
Three of what kind?

146
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,474
Three anything.
Three nines, three tens, three jacks.

147
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,719
- Which ones are the tens?
- Don't you know how to read?

148
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,388
I never went to school.

149
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,956
- Can you write?
- If I could write I could read.

150
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,357
- Anything you can do?
- Reach.

151
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,716
That's a waste of good whiskey.

152
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,151
Where you were going,
you wouldn't need whiskey.

153
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:55,551
A ten has got ten spots on it,
you can count that far on your toes.

154
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,352
Max...

155
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,793
Take it easy. It's a quiet town.
I know people, I do business with 'em.

156
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,310
All right, but, Mr Cord,
if you happen to see...

157
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,992
I know, if I see anything like a horse
with an ''SS'' brand, l'll come and get you.

158
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,275
Here's a buck. Buy yourself some candy.

159
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,036
Yes, sir. Can I help you today?

160
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,511
A can of peaches. A big can, please.

161
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,358
Best eastern peaches in the West.

162
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,630
Would you open it for me?

163
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,996
No charge.

164
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,510
You got a book
that teaches reading and writing?

165
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,678
McGuffey's Primer.
Right under the stairs.

166
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,551
Hey...

167
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,514
Of course, you can't pick one out
until you can read!

168
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,188
It's this one here.

169
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,995
25 cents for the peaches
and 1 0 cents for the book.

170
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,275
Ideas don't weigh much but peaches do
and freight is charged by weight.

171
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,996
Most people are hungrier
in their stomachs than in their minds.

172
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,718
Well, here's your first decision.

173
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,878
The top sign says Silver City.
That's in Colorado.

174
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,995
The second one, the one over there,
that's Donner, California.

175
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,158
The one on the bottom,
that says Sonora.

176
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,920
That's down south in Old Mexico.

177
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,476
I sure can't tell you which way to go,

178
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,116
but if you wanna catch 'em,
go where the money is.

179
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,518
They'll head for where they can
spend it or steal it.

180
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,717
Mr Cord, I don't know how
I can ever pay you back for all this.

181
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,278
No need to.

182
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,032
If you get tired of chasing 'em,
look me up and we'll talk about it.

183
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,838
Well, no use drawing this out.
Good luck, Max.

184
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,679
Bang, bang.

185
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,708
Very nicely done.

186
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,869
Handling one of these is only half of it.
The rest is learning human nature.

187
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,075
That takes a lifetime,
so you'd better not trust anyone.

188
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,155
You wanna plan your moves,
pick your place to fight,

189
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,718
don't make any threats,
and don't you ever walk away from one.

190
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,038
Goodbye, Max.

191
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,794
Goodbye, Mr Cord.

192
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,630
Don't even trust a friend.

193
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,909
Come on, Struther,
you've washed your pink body enough.

194
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,429
Struther, please hurry up.

195
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,518
Hey, the dames are coming!

196
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,193
The dames are coming!

197
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,109
Struther, you'd better hurry up
and get outta there.

198
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,594
Pink...

199
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,074
Red...

200
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,234
Cat got your tongue? Come on!

201
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,318
- Gee, you're cute.
- Walter? How are you?

202
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,115
- Hey, look at me!
- Shut up.

203
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,911
Hello, cowboy. Welcome to town.

204
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:53,148
- Try the next room.
- White women more popular.

205
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,430
They saved me for you.

206
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,799
- Navajo?
- Kiowa.

207
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,156
I am Kiowa, too.

208
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,192
Yes or no?

209
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,998
$5...

210
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,756
...for some questions.

211
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,671
I'm looking for three men.

212
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,078
One is named Jesse,
got a scar on his neck, carries a knife.

213
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,034
He may be riding a grey horse.
Ever see anyone like that?

214
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,310
Lots of men with scars come here.

215
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,600
Buy yourself some moccasins.

216
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,356
Why do you ask for them?

217
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,676
They tortured and killed a woman.

218
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,269
Kiowa, like you.

219
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,638
One man...

220
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,753
...has a scar here.

221
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,590
He works downstairs
dealing cards in the bar.

222
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:24,118
- But he might not be the same man.
- Where does he keep his horse?

223
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,993
In the stable across the street.

224
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,998
But please don't tell anyone I told you.

225
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,397
- Hey, mister?
- Yeah?

226
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,989
That grey for sale?

227
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,069
Belongs to Jack Langely at the
Palace Bar. I don't think he'll sell him.

228
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,956
Jesse!

229
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,031
- Any cards, boys?
- You, dealing cards.

230
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,438
- Jesse who?
- Jesse coward, Jesse murderer.

231
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,393
- Woman killer.
- My name is Jack Langely.

232
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,068
When you killed my parents,
it was Jesse.

233
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,193
I'm Jack Langely.
When did this killing take place?

234
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,358
- Hey, Hudson, what's my name?
- Jack Langely.

235
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,917
- How long have I worked here?
- A year, year and a half.

236
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,714
- Anything else?
- Stand up.

237
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,638
I'm not armed.

238
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:43,152
My father wasn't armed when
you tied him up and blew his head off.

239
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,396
- Kid...
- I know what I'm doing.

240
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,672
- He's riding my father's horse.
- It's mine.

241
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,199
With an ''SS'' brand?

242
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,914
I have a bill of sale for it.

243
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,715
Fair enough, let's see it.

244
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,794
Now, look, son...

245
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,115
If Langely did what you said,
I'll let you kill him.

246
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,155
But if he's got a bill of sale,
you could have the wrong man.

247
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,278
Let's look.

248
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,276
Come on, both of you.

249
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,354
You fight like your mother, boy.

250
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,235
Should've taken you to a sailmaker
to get stitched up.

251
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,797
That McGuffey Reader in your shirt
kept that knife from your stomach.

252
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,195
The minute he's done, you move on.

253
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,359
How can he ride a horse
with all them stitches in him?

254
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,154
That's up to him.

255
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,716
You killed a man,
as you tell it, for good reason.

256
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,309
You did what you had to, so am I.

257
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:30,834
If we don't drive you out,
there'll be more killing. Got any friends?

258
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,631
An lndian girl was asking about you.
Maybe she can help.

259
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,390
Where...? How did you get...?

260
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,390
You come back to us in trouble
and in pain. You are welcome.

261
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,878
- How long?
- Many days.

262
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,959
You talk in fever
of the death of your father and Tabinaka,

263
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,037
my brother's daughter.

264
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,879
You stay here with your own people.

265
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:49,318
Neesa, she became shame of Kiowa,
but she bring you home.

266
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:55,436
That's good. Maybe both of you
make each other well.

267
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,596
You stay here.

268
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,797
Oh, no. You get back in there.
It's hot water and it's good for you.

269
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,712
''See... See the frog...

270
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,638
''...on a log.

271
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,673
''Rab sees the frog...''

272
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,316
Three weeks you sit here.
You never laugh or smile.

273
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,548
''Can the frog see Rab?''

274
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,550
You learn to read not to make you wise
but to help you find men to kill.

275
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:09,879
''The frog can see the dog.
Rab ran at...''

276
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:15,438
Do you think that I became
a dance-hall girl because I was bad?

277
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,155
It was because I was full of hatred
and foolish.

278
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,717
''See the lamp. It...''

279
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,994
If there was a medicine that would
change the way I was, I would take it.

280
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,551
- Do you know of one?
- Neesa, it's got nothing to do with you.

281
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,229
Honestly, nothing.

282
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,197
If I could find a medicine,
I'd take it myself.

283
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,920
- Really?
- For true.

284
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,558
See the lamp?

285
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,995
It is out.

286
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,997
- It ain't gonna work, Neesa.
- Why?

287
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,270
I'm gonna have to go soon.

288
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,949
- When?
- One morning I'll be gone.

289
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,389
Make yourself at home.

290
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,391
You looking for anything in particular?

291
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,196
- Names, that's all. I'm no thief.
- Yeah...

292
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,034
- What kind of names?
- Friends of Jesse Coe's.

293
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,760
Are you a friend of Jesse Coe's?

294
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,716
I'm the one that killed him.

295
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,716
My name is Angie.

296
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,310
Mrs Coe.

297
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,072
You might call me ''The Widow Coe''.

298
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,317
- I don't know what to say.
- I do.

299
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,838
Thank you.

300
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,548
Tell me about the men he rode with.

301
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,590
You know, you look young.

302
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,875
But any man that could take
Jesse Coe with a knife...

303
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,714
...had to be some man.

304
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,708
Do you know where they are?
Do you know their names?

305
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,111
Well, I think one of 'em's name is...

306
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,709
...Bowdre, Bill Bowdre.

307
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,755
He wanted Jesse to go on a bank job
with him, down in Louisiana.

308
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,994
And it's really too bad he didn't go.

309
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,352
- Why?
- 'Cause they got caught. Put in prison.

310
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,996
There was one other one.

311
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,430
I don't know his name.

312
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,396
That's all I can tell you.

313
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,835
''Western gang...

314
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,239
''...robs...

315
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,515
''...Bank of...

316
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,395
''...New Orleans.

317
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,953
''Two...

318
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,992
''...a-a...''

319
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:19,031
Hey, Cap... What's that word?

320
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,356
The word is ''apprehended''.

321
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,074
What does it mean?

322
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,113
Well, it means...caught.

323
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,113
Say anything
about where they were taken?

324
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:39,312
No, but a fella robs a bank down here,
they throw him in the state prison camp.

325
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,112
Much obliged.

326
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,994
- Corbin? How do you want yours?
- Just money!

327
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:16,671
- Sand, how do you want it?
- I want all of it, in that bag.

328
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,155
- Max...
- Shut up.

329
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,119
- The big money's in the vault.
- Get back.

330
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,598
Stay there.

331
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,994
There's only one this time, Warden.

332
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,839
Two years. He robbed a bank.

333
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,437
''Two years hard labour.''

334
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,712
That's the only kind we got here.

335
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,708
Starting with me, everything here
is mean and miserable.

336
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,117
The heat, the mosquitoes,
the food, the life.

337
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,636
There's nothing to do all day but work,
nothing to do at night but sleep.

338
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,879
We don't have any walls or fences.
The swamp is our wall.

339
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,196
Miles and miles of it,

340
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:46,236
filled with dirty water, quicksand,
moccasins and malaria.

341
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,673
- Any questions?
- No.

342
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,836
''No, sir.''

343
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,551
No, sir.

344
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,716
Just one more thing.

345
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,355
Don't ever make me mad.

346
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,232
- Big Foot!
- Yes, sir, Warden.

347
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,638
- Put him in Miller's bunk.
- Yes, sir, Warden. Let's go.

348
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,233
Right over there.

349
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,753
Don't be looking at this gun.
They want you to go for it.

350
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,157
I'm a prisoner just like yourself.
I'm a trusty.

351
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,918
In there.

352
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:10,033
You don't get to keep anything,
just a blanket and clothes.

353
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,312
Shave once a week,
one razor for the whole barracks.

354
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,273
This is your bunk. Belonged to Miller.

355
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,954
- He died.
- The only way out, is it?

356
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,799
They try it through the swamps.

357
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,639
The dogs are after two of them now.

358
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:29,469
They tried to rob a bank in New Orleans.

359
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,116
- Bowdre...
- Him and Strayhorn. Friends of yours?

360
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,790
No, I read it in the paper.
Did they make it?

361
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,560
Nobody's made it since I've been here.

362
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,036
Go to the blacksmith,
put these leg irons on you.

363
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,476
Something bothering you, boy?

364
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,356
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

365
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,473
Big Foot!

366
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,592
Get 'em all out here
so they can watch this.

367
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,592
Let's go.

368
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,078
Big Foot!

369
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,191
Now, you listen to this.

370
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,678
Strayhorn died in the swamp.
Bowdre here's gonna wish he did, too.

371
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,279
When he serves his time,
he'll serve every day of Strayhorn's.

372
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,832
You think about that...hard.

373
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:54,596
- A man lies where he falls here.
- He'll drown.

374
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,755
The warden's watching you, boy.

375
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,392
Back to the mess hall. Let's move!

376
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:52,153
Get back in there
and keep the fires going till morning.

377
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:56,876
- When do I sleep?
- Just don't let the fires go out.

378
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:05,277
- He's really giving it to me, ain't he?
- You made yourself a lot of enemies.

379
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,716
For what it's worth to you...

380
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,558
...you made yourself a lot of friends, too.

381
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,198
Thanks for what you did.

382
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,392
- You'd have done the same.
- I don't know.

383
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,034
Maybe I can do something
for you some day.

384
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,595
Maybe you can, some day.

385
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:03,715
- Haven't I seen you before?
- You! Back to work. No more talking.

386
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,270
I don't know. Maybe.

387
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,718
- You ever been in Santa Fe, Max?
- No.

388
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,151
Bowdre...
What went wrong out there?

389
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,954
We got lost.

390
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:43,235
- Maybe it was Juarez.
- Juarez? No, I don't think so.

391
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:49,231
- Didn't you have a plan or nothin'?
- Sure, to move fast and not get caught.

392
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,830
- What was it like out there?
- In the swamp?

393
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,036
It was just like the warden said,
miles and miles of swamp, quicksand,

394
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,552
razorbacks, poison snakes,
mosquitoes, everything that kills.

395
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:08,639
No food, water you couldn't drink.
We went in circles.

396
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:14,790
- I've had all the swamp I want.
- Yeah? I'm going.

397
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,750
- How?
- I don't know yet.

398
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:24,159
- What if I find a way?
- I've had it. You count me out.

399
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:28,876
I can't.
You're the only man here I'd risk it with.

400
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,877
- Nice evening.
- For people with guns.

401
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:41,154
- Take it easy, fella. I just do my job.
- And how you love it.

402
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,316
I love living, same as you.

403
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:47,149
Trouble with this place,
you can't pick your friends.

404
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,235
This is new. Where are we going?

405
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,000
- Didn't they tell you?
- Tell me what?

406
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,033
We're clearing this
for new rice paddies.

407
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,993
That's why everyone's so happy.

408
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,796
- Is that good?
- Good? They got women there, pal.

409
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:38,518
Lo and behold. Lo and behold!

410
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,632
Pick one for yourself.
Give her a big smile.

411
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,478
Smile?

412
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,834
- For what?
- Don't you know?

413
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:51,396
The warden rents us out to the planters.

414
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,672
He keeps the money,
but we get the women.

415
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,394
Yeah? How?

416
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,433
One Saturday night a month
while we're here,

417
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,428
he lets 'em come into the barracks.

418
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,189
They let the women
come to the barracks?

419
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,709
I didn't believe it at first.

420
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:14,356
- And we can talk to 'em?
- Talk to them?

421
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:19,078
Stop dreaming of women.
Think about a boat.

422
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,352
All I can see,
feel or think about is woman.

423
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,348
With a boat there's no struggling
in the swamps, no snakes...

424
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,872
- You still have to know which way to go.
- I thought about that.

425
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:35,471
And the water, the food and a gun,
but let's start with a boat.

426
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,069
All right, let's go. Get to work.

427
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,316
- Work. Let's go.
- Come with me.

428
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,633
Let's go.

429
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,470
Hurry up, don't take all day.

430
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:02,593
- What's taking so long?
- Maybe the warden changed his mind.

431
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,519
I'll kill him with my bare hands.

432
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,792
How ya doing, Max?

433
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,156
They are coming, ain't they?

434
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,113
Let's douse the lights down there.

435
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,475
They'll come now the candles are out.

436
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:24,118
- Are you young or old?
- I'm young.

437
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,117
So am I.

438
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:31,395
- What's your name?
- Max.

439
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,670
Mine's Pilar.

440
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:40,758
- What'd you do to wind up in here?
- Nothin' much.

441
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,315
- Did you kill somebody?
- No.

442
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,948
I'm glad I didn't get one that kills.

443
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,232
No, I just tried to steal some money.

444
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,352
- For a woman?
- No.

445
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,395
You talk different.
You're not from here, are you?

446
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,558
No, I'm from the West.

447
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,158
Oh.

448
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:27,557
It's dry there. And clean.

449
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,751
You were born here, huh?

450
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:34,750
Born here, knee-deep in water all my life
and I'll likely die here.

451
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,270
I was thinking,
you're a prisoner here same as me.

452
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,029
Yeah, but one day they'll let you go.

453
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:48,913
Well, if you hate it so much,
why don't you do something about it?

454
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:54,428
- Do something? What?
- Get out. Escape.

455
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,915
- Escape? How?
- In a boat.

456
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,395
With me.

457
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,795
You interested, Pilar?

458
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:15,998
Bowdre...

459
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,595
I think she's going to help us.
She's showing me a boat.

460
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:27,950
- I don't see any boat.
- Right over there, by those bushes.

461
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:31,436
- What does she want for it?
- To go with us.

462
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:35,474
No. I like women,
but not when I'm running.

463
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,148
Oh, yeah. You got lost, didn't you?

464
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:42,353
She was born here, she knows
these swamps. We gotta have her.

465
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,109
Yeah... How are you gonna
arrange everything?

466
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,550
- And we need a gun.
- I know.

467
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:57,838
You boys better get your talking done.
You won't have much more time for it.

468
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,669
They're sending 20 men out
to another camp next week.

469
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,519
You're on the list, Max.

470
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,711
- Here they come.
- Hey, here they come!

471
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,753
Pilar...

472
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,277
Listen, Pilar, I have to talk to you.
Let's go outside.

473
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,833
They're taking me out of here next week,
to a new place.

474
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,759
Maybe it'll be easier to get out of.

475
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,635
It'll have stone walls,
we won't see each other again.

476
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,831
We have to get out before that.

477
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,554
Getting a boat by myself won't be easy.

478
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,752
It's the only way,
if we're gonna be together.

479
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,073
- What happens to me then?
- I'll take care of you, Pilar.

480
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:22,114
You bring me the boat,
show me the way, I'll make you free.

481
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,153
And I'll start you off in life real good.

482
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:31,154
Just treat me nice, Max,
that's all I want.

483
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:40,911
- You'll be there? Certain?
- I'll try.

484
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,669
Trying ain't good enough,
you've got to be there.

485
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,919
Two hours after sunset,
meet me at the edge of the swamp.

486
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,759
Bring the boat by that stand of cypress.

487
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:55,475
- Let's go back inside, Max, I'm scared.
- Pilar...

488
01:16:55,680 --> 01:17:00,231
If you're not there and they catch me,
you know what they'll do to me.

489
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,998
I'll be there.

490
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,434
Max...you'll treat me nice, won't you?

491
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,874
Yes.

492
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,034
...six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven...

493
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:37,593
...thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

494
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:09,670
- Are you sure this is the place?
- Yeah.

495
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:12,155
That dirty, filthy, lying Cajun...

496
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:15,796
- There ain't no boats anywhere around.
- Shut up!

497
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:21,711
When Big Foot comes to they'll
be after us. We shoulda killed him.

498
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:30,593
Get in.

499
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,515
Something hit me.

500
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,113
Let's go.

501
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,514
Joe.

502
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:05,834
If we don't get him back,
you'll serve out his time.

503
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:10,358
If he kills one of my men with your gun,
l'll hang you.

504
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,518
Yes, sir, Warden. I'll get him.

505
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,508
Pilar, which way?

506
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,638
Go right.

507
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,116
I gotta look at it.

508
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,276
- Hold that.
- Bread?

509
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,311
Good poultice.

510
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,118
Right!

511
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,153
Bottle.

512
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,715
Coulda used swamp water for that.

513
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,838
Pilar...

514
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:20,078
- How do you feel?
- I don't know.

515
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,679
I'm so sleepy.

516
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,956
You've got a fever, that's all.

517
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,556
Max...we're not going
to get out of here, are we?

518
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,436
We're going to get out of here.
You just tell me if we're heading right.

519
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:43,033
- I'm not sure.
- Take a guess.

520
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,831
Best one you can.

521
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,988
Keep that way.

522
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:59,151
- What's wrong with her?
- Snake bite.

523
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:04,752
You can't go by her,
she's out of her mind. We're lost.

524
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:10,114
We're all right. We ain't lost.
We're heading west.

525
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:17,034
- How do you know?
- I can tell. The sun.

526
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,196
The sun?

527
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:26,277
What do you think you are,
a lousy lndian or something?

528
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:31,554
That's right, I'm half lousy lndian,
and my mother was an lndian.

529
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,836
Max...

530
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,996
Max Sand.

531
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,589
I swear I didn't kill 'em.
I had nothing to do with it.

532
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:01,157
I was outside minding the horses.
It was that crazy Jesse Coe.

533
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,716
- But he paid for it. Somebody got him.
- Me.

534
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:09,118
- Who else was with Coe?
- Fitch. Tom Fitch.

535
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:13,598
Two guys I just fell in with.
I didn't know what they were like.

536
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,713
- Where's Fitch?
- California gold fields, last I heard.

537
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:23,631
Look, I didn't wanna do it. I couldn't
help it. They made me do it with them.

538
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,558
- You scared?
- Yes!

539
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,672
- Like my mother was?
- Give me a chance.

540
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,075
- Don't shoot!
- That's all I ask.

541
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:35,478
- Like you blew my father's head off?
- You're crazy!

542
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:38,874
That's why you wanted to escape,
so you could kill him.

543
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,832
What do you plan for me?

544
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:17,229
- What were they shooting?
- I don't know, but they used five bullets.

545
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,398
If we can't travel in this, they can't either.

546
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:24,149
They've got a boat, man,
don't you realise that?

547
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:52,552
There's nothing I can do to help you,

548
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:56,036
unless we get out of this swamp
as quick as we can.

549
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:59,232
I don't know where we are.

550
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:06,875
Cool air from dry land makes fog.

551
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:11,596
- You could be out by morning.
- I'll find a doctor or somebody.

552
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:15,236
You can't stop, you'll get caught.

553
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,637
- Leave me.
- I couldn't do that, Pilar.

554
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:24,396
I want you to.

555
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:27,751
You're a dirty, low animal.

556
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:34,877
You lied to me. You used me to kill.
You're worse than the man you killed.

557
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,674
You don't care about me or anybody.

558
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,917
- You'd kill me, too, if you had to.
- No.

559
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,556
No? You have!

560
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:50,631
You're not going to die, Pilar, I promise.

561
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:56,038
- You'd promise anything.
- I won't let you.

562
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:00,358
What do you think you are, God?

563
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,391
Go away.

564
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:08,311
Go away! I don't wanna die in sin
looking at your face!

565
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,158
I'm sorry.

566
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,436
I'm so sorry.

567
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:43,194
You been askin' around
for a man by the name of Tom Fitch?

568
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,709
- He's my brother.
- I heard of him.

569
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,239
You did, huh?

570
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:52,958
A couple of months ago he rode through
here, up to no good. Headed north.

571
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,558
How'd he look?

572
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:59,799
Mean as you.
The kind somebody's always looking for.

573
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,152
- I hope you keep on looking.
- You do, huh?

574
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:10,196
Yeah, because then you'll be moving on
as soon as your horse gets shod.

575
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,755
- You will, won't you?
- Most likely.

576
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,590
Most definitely.

577
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,675
- Three kings.
- Tom Fitch...

578
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:31,398
Heard about a Joe Fitch, worked in
the mine, 300 feet down. He's still there.

579
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:36,628
Then there was a Carrot Fitch, red hair.
But that was back in Fort Wayne.

580
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:40,116
No, Tom Fitch doesn't ring a bell.

581
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:43,232
Any reason why you're tracking him?

582
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,716
He's my brother.
Got a message from home.

583
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:51,072
- You'll run into him one of these days.
- I hope so.

584
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,755
I'll put the horses in the corral.

585
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,389
- You got some coffee?
- Yeah.

586
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,037
Why are you staring at that?
You've seen it.

587
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:02,677
- Pretty fancy.
- Made from the dress of an lndian.

588
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:06,714
- Named Sand?
- Yeah. Yeah!

589
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:15,713
Well, who woulda thought a wet-nosed
kid woulda made a big thing out of it?

590
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,399
It's the Indian in him.

591
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:22,594
One of the best knife-men I knew was
Jesse Coe. He killed him with a knife.

592
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,268
Then he tracks Bowdre to Louisiana,

593
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:30,076
gets himself thrown in prison
just to gun him down, then he escaped.

594
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:33,078
You got a bad case of the shakes, Fitch.

595
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:37,159
The shakes!
The kid's creepy, he ain't human.

596
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:41,273
He doesn't kill people, he executes them.

597
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,040
Yeah, he executes them.

598
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,197
Hard job, ain't it, killing time?

599
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:32,392
I'm working. You just can't see it.

600
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,673
Gimme a drink.

601
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:59,395
- Hell of a way to begin a day, ain't it?
- I ain't crying about it, why should you?

602
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:05,436
If ever you could, it'd add 20 years
to your life...and maybe somebody else's.

603
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:17,558
- Morning, Buck.
- Morning.

604
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,399
I thought I told you to get out of town.

605
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,231
I didn't know there was any hurry.

606
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:32,992
Mr Fitch, this here
is a hair-trigger .45 I'm holding.

607
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:39,389
The slightest jar and it goes off...by itself.
Makes a hole as big as a cannonball.

608
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,558
Now, turn around
and put your hands on the bar.

609
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,876
Put the cuffs on him.

610
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,671
Our job is to keep our ears open
and our mouths shut.

611
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:16,668
- How are we gonna find Fitch?
- He'll find us.

612
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,916
He was spreading bills all over town.

613
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:27,671
I was first to notice something wrong.
The sheriff nailed him here.

614
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:31,031
- Hey, can we have three whiskeys?
- Yes, sir.

615
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:35,313
He wasn't a bad guy, though.
A little hard, but interesting.

616
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,511
What was his name?

617
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:42,953
Fitch. Tom or Joe Fitch,
something like that, I don't remember.

618
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,310
There you are. Six bits.

619
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,038
Hey, Fitch.

620
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:07,038
Hey, Fitch, it's Beckwith.
Are you in there?

621
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:14,549
- I'm here.
- Get ready, we're getting you out.

622
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:54,270
Hey, that's not Fitch!

623
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:15,359
- Who the hell are you?
- Tom Fitch.

624
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:18,120
Try again.

625
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:23,228
- Now who are you?
- Tom Fitch.

626
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,192
Give him some more.

627
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:40,193
What is going on here?
Answer me, what's going on here?

628
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:44,518
- Are you trying to kill this man?
- Let go of that rope.

629
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:47,678
Not before I find out
what this is all about.

630
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,999
Nobody pulls a gun on a priest.

631
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:55,033
- Who says so?
- Me, Cipriano say so.

632
01:37:55,240 --> 01:38:01,554
- By the Blessed Virgin, I mean it.
- I believe you. Let's get outta here.

633
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,558
You've never been
in a church before, hmm?

634
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:32,591
No.

635
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,758
And what do you think of it?

636
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:40,596
I don't know. It's kinda strange.

637
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,676
Did you ever see Him before?

638
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:54,399
Yeah, once.
He was on the end of a little silver chain.

639
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,829
He is the Son of God,

640
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:02,635
who came to earth
to teach men love by example.

641
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,470
He must have missed somebody.
That looks worse than hanging.

642
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:27,319
- You didn't come to supper.
- I didn't work this afternoon.

643
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:34,313
You know, Padre, this room
is worse than some jails I've been in.

644
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:40,072
In a way, we're both prisoners here.
Myself by choice, you by circumstance.

645
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:43,397
- Son, you...
- Will you quit calling me ''son''?

646
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,910
- My father's dead.
- I know, Max.

647
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:51,238
You'll be here for some weeks.
Use them profitably.

648
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:54,273
- Arguing with you?
- You might read.

649
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,835
I brought you a book, the Bible.

650
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,838
Men have been reading it
for many centuries.

651
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:02,429
- What's it about?
- Everything important.

652
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,915
There's only one thing important to me.

653
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:09,830
Finding and killing a man, eh?
Primitive, hopeless revenge.

654
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:12,110
- I'll settle for that.
- Why?

655
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:16,233
There is another half of you
waiting to be discovered.

656
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:20,433
You also inherited a tradition
of philosophy and conscience.

657
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,676
I don't understand them words.

658
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:28,716
The difference between right and wrong
and knowing when not to do wrong.

659
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:32,754
If the civilised half of you
ever wakes up, Max,

660
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:36,589
with God's help, you could become
a whole man some day.

661
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:42,113
With God's help my leg will heal before
you can say ''amen'' and I'll be gone.

662
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,234
Goodnight.

663
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:16,074
- Padre.
- Come in, come in, Max.

664
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:22,310
I'm leaving now
and I want to bring back your Bible.

665
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:26,832
You've had it a long time.
Why don't you keep it?

666
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:30,589
Well, I remember the things
that matter to me...

667
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:33,232
...an eye for an eye.

668
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:39,828
- Which way are you heading?
- I'm going north.

669
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:43,669
You look well. Healthy, rested, alive!

670
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:47,668
Quite different
from when I first found you.

671
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:52,679
Padre, I want to thank you
for what you did for me.

672
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:55,155
Maybe some day I can pay you back.

673
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:59,638
Max, please, sit down a moment.

674
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:06,154
I would like to show you something.

675
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,556
Take a look at that.

676
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,795
Surely a picture can't hurt you.

677
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:20,156
That beautiful couple,
that young man and woman,

678
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:24,558
came all the way
from an ancient European civilisation

679
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:28,992
to find a new and promising life
in the American West.

680
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:34,877
On the way, a band of lndians
raided their wagons.

681
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:39,198
They killed and scalped both of them,

682
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:42,437
after indulging in
coarse lndian pleasures.

683
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:45,518
Two of the children

684
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:51,955
were swung by the heels
and had their heads crushed.

685
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:56,472
The third child was saved
and grew up alone,

686
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:58,750
wanting only vengeance.

687
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:01,435
Believe me, Max,

688
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:07,749
it took more courage to refrain from
the obvious temptation than to give in.

689
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,070
- We're different men, Padre.
- No.

690
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,755
That was my family, Max.

691
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:27,396
I'm the only one who survived.

692
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:31,114
Don't do any more.

693
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:35,711
Stop while you can. Save yourself, Max.

694
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:43,190
Don't say what you will or won't do.

695
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:48,269
Just remember,
when you ride out of here,

696
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,914
God goes with you.

697
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:00,516
I'll keep it in mind.

698
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:15,799
Wait a minute.

699
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,869
That's who was using your name.

700
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:34,595
- You told me he was dead.
- We left him for dead.

701
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:22,474
Hey, you. Tough guy.

702
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:34,036
- I could use somebody like you.
- Doing what?

703
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:37,835
- Do you care?
- Yeah, I do.

704
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:44,394
- Who are you?
- Smith. Nevada Smith.

705
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,954
- You look broke.
- I am.

706
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:49,718
Suit yourself,

707
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:54,789
but if you're interested
in making a lot of money fast, follow me.

708
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:26,478
Here, put your horse in the corral.
Take mine, too, then come in.

709
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,592
No, wait.

710
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:46,477
You, shotgun upstairs. Cipriano, behind
the door. The rest of you find your spots.

711
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:49,069
We'll soon find out who he is.

712
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,508
You go in there. Take that room.

713
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:07,674
Good.

714
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:32,276
Come on in, come on.

715
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:42,153
Here, sit down. Sit down here.

716
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:56,109
Say...Smith...

717
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:57,878
Tell me...

718
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:03,429
- Why did you use my name?
- I heard of you around.

719
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:07,189
When they caught me,
I said the first name I thought of.

720
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:12,599
Under my own name, I'm wanted.
But I didn't know you were in these parts.

721
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:16,315
You're wanted? You?

722
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:18,476
What are you wanted for?

723
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:21,717
Trying to make a living the easy way,
same as you.

724
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,478
Me?

725
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:28,355
- Did you ever see me before?
- Not as I recall.

726
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,879
Any family living?

727
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:37,835
- Why do you wanna know?
- Don't get hot under the collar, Smith.

728
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:41,828
Sometimes when you're running,
a family can help.

729
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:50,755
Last time I remember, I had a mother,
a father, two sisters and one's married.

730
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:55,276
- What kind of set-up you got?
- We'll get to that.

731
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:59,792
Tell me...have you ever heard
of a Max Sand?

732
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:08,635
Sand... Yeah, I seen
some wanted posters on him.

733
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,751
Never met him. Why?

734
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,876
I killed his mother and father.

735
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:22,029
- So?
- So he's out to get me.

736
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:28,953
Part-lndian. If there's anything
I can't stomach, it's a half-breed.

737
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:35,592
Of course, I can understand
how it happens.

738
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:39,349
There's nothing like an lndian squaw.
You agree?

739
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:44,350
- One of my best kinds of fun.
- Me, too.

740
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:51,917
Hold it. Here...why don't you use
some good tobacco?

741
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:57,037
What do you think of that pouch?

742
01:50:57,240 --> 01:51:02,439
- Unusual. Where'd you get it?
- Gift... Sort of a gift.

743
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,670
Fitch, let's get down to it.

744
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:08,952
You said you could use
a man like me. For what?

745
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,995
We're knocking off a gold shipment.

746
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:18,149
I'll give you the details tomorrow.
Until then, relax. Get to know the boys.

747
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:21,833
OK.

748
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:27,310
Use one of the rooms upstairs.

749
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,197
See you around.

750
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:34,234
Max...

751
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:40,400
Nothing, I was just talking to the...

752
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:20,031
They take $250,000 worth of gold
a month out of there.

753
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:23,277
It's too big to hit and too well guarded.

754
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:26,472
They're digging up our future right now.

755
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:29,558
Once a month,
a gold wagon goes to the railroad,

756
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:32,069
two men on the wagon, twelve guards.

757
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:34,236
We'll have a dozen waiting.

758
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:37,671
You won't go very fast
with a wagon full of gold.

759
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:43,193
We don't. We put it in our saddlebags
and head out in 1 2 different directions.

760
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:47,916
- Equal split?
- No. All you can grab.

761
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:53,069
There won't be much time but we'll
load up enough to last you a few years.

762
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:57,872
A few of us are liable to get killed.
Scare you?

763
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:03,279
No. I don't plan to be one of them,
and there'll be more for the rest of us.

764
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:07,632
Hey, I like you.
l like him, he's got a sense of humour.

765
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:17,875
Black widow, jack of hearts,
queen of hearts,

766
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,548
deuce of hearts, another black queen...

767
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:23,069
Gimme that bottle!

768
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:26,431
Now, we're not running
any Sunday school...

769
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:33,751
...but nobody takes another drink
from now until we're finished.

770
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:36,952
I don't want jumpy riders
and nervous triggers.

771
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:41,915
This won't be a cowhand Saturday night
spree, shooting up the town.

772
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:45,829
We're gonna move in fast,
hit hard and run.

773
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:47,519
Every man for himself.

774
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:50,314
- Shoot to kill?
- Is there any other way?

775
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:51,794
No.

776
01:53:56,720 --> 01:54:01,475
They move the shipment out at 8.
We'll be up at 5. Any questions?

777
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:08,190
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

778
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:16,320
- What are you thinking about?
- How I'm gonna spend that gold.

779
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:20,068
- Shoot straight.
- I intend to.

780
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:01,153
Max...

781
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:06,036
Hey, Max!

782
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:30,757
They'll come down here
heading for that pocket.

783
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,318
Here's the road.

784
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:40,913
Rudabough, take three men on this side.
Keep your horses outta sight.

785
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:43,588
You take three
and set up a roadblock.

786
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:46,712
Nothing gets by. That means the wagon.

787
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:52,995
Cipriano, you and two men on this side.
I'll go up the road so they can't turn back.

788
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:54,633
- Alone?
- Yes!

789
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:58,435
- You don't have to get...
- I'm giving the orders!

790
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:03,915
Shoot fast, aim to kill.
Get the drivers first.

791
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:07,192
We have to do this quick,
before help can come.

792
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:09,960
With the first shot, we all close in.

793
01:56:10,160 --> 01:56:12,151
Now, any questions?

794
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:21,360
Don't make any mistakes, Max Sand.

795
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:26,920
If they don't get you, I will.

796
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:40,076
Look at this, man!

797
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:00,273
Max! Max Sand!

798
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:03,350
- That's me.
- Max...

799
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:10,195
- Max, I'm out of ammunition.
- Then get out of there.

800
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:12,753
All right.

801
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:15,553
All right.

802
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:18,438
I'm coming.

803
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:22,839
I'm coming.

804
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:29,838
I'm coming, Max.

805
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:31,314
Here...

806
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:52,874
Why my hand, why not me?

807
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:07,072
- Huh?
- 'Cause I want to see you beg.

808
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:09,635
Beg, you... Beg!

809
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:15,599
- Beg for what?
- Beg, like my mother and father begged.

810
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:18,271
Your mother?

811
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:22,834
Yeah...

812
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,074
Here...

813
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,635
Here, maybe you want this, huh?

814
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:47,715
Come on...

815
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:50,639
Come on, get it over with.

816
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:52,398
Get it over with.

817
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:56,309
For God's sake, get it over with.

818
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:59,876
You waited years for this,
so get it over with.

819
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:02,273
Come on.

820
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:07,398
Finish me. Finish...

821
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:10,078
Finish me!

822
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:17,110
You haven't got the guts.

823
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:21,951
You're yellow!

824
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:28,353
Finish me!

825
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:37,160
You're just not worth killing.

826
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:54,108
Finish me. Finish me!

827
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:58,195
You're yellow!

828
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:01,597
You haven't got the guts!

829
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:06,952
You're yellow!

830
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:14,235
You haven't got the guts!

831
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:17,637
You're yellow!
