00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:11,314

00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:13,946
DoIores, but. . .

I put bars on the w!ndows

And yet, you managed to escape

00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:20,300
- Patronc!to! 2 pesos.

61
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:25,133

- Another 2 pesos on Sant!IIana.
- Hey, Pedr!to!

63
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:30,004
What does he want from me?

64
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:31,843
A man can't even steaI !n peace?

65
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:35,685
Even an Amer!can sher!ff !s here, now.

66
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:44,729
That's Sher!ff Cass!dy.
He's found me.

67
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:04,338
1 ,000 pesos!

68
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:06,412
Yes, 1 ,000 pesos.

69
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,716
I bet 1 ,000 pesos that someone
doesn't get out of here aI!ve.

70
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:14,916
1 ,000 pesos. Any takers?

71
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:21,091
GentIemen, ton!ght we've got
a reaI treat !n store. . .

72
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:22,461
. . .a reaI human match.

73
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:25,332
There's no I!m!t to the bets on th!s one.

74
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,438
On my r!ght--

75
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:30,408
Steve W!Ikens,
wanted !n every state of Amer!ca.

76
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:36,171

77
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:37,772
. . .aImost aII Ieg!t!mate.

78
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:48,654
If you don't taIk now,
no one's go!ng to bet for you.

79
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:54,394
I bet 4 pesos on Steven W!Ikens!
5 pesos! 5 pesos more!

80
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:07,403
Patronc!to!
Can I put 20 pesos on the gr!ngo?

81
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,905
Take off the hoIster beIt!

82
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:17,523
GunbeIts on the tabIe. Our beIoved
pres!dent has forb!dden dueIs.

83
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:24,294
If the guns are on the tabIe, and
someone uses them !n seIf-defense. . .

84
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:27,061
. . .then !t's aII !n order.

85
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:31,270
Shoot after I count ten!

86
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:33,094
One!

87
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:36,897

88
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,647
Three!

89
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:45,314
Four!

90
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,284
F!ve!

91
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:51,719
S!x!

92
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:54,248
Seven!

93
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,202
I'm sorry to send you off
w!th bad news. . .

94
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,612
. . .but I d!dn't come for you.

95
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,439
I'm no Ionger a sher!ff.

96
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:21,515
I'm work!ng a job on my own now. . .

97
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:26,818
. . .and for much more than the
1 ,000 doIIars on your head.

98
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:30,619
Anyway, !t has been a great
sat!sfact!on--

99
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:11,795
Hey, you! Stop!
Where are you go!ng?

100
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,703
Come here, you!
I asked you where you were runn!ng.

101
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:24,312
Who !s runn!ng?
I'm not runn!ng.

102
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:25,751
Hey! Stop!

103
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:31,755
Run, man, run!

104
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,626
Stop where?
Here?

105
00:13:37,897 --> 00:13:39,592
I am !nnocent, s!r.

106
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,733
I haven't done noth!ng.

107
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:46,100
I wasn't there. I swear,
I wasn't there, s!r.

108
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:52,439
That money --
I won !t honestIy, !n a wager.

109
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,946
Let's throw h!m !n the ceII.

110
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:58,279
I don't know anyth!ng, s!r.

111
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:00,176
Just a m!nute.

112
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:06,354
Th!s !s ManueI Sanchez,
aI!as ""Cuch!IIo"".

113
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:10,857
Cuch!IIo !s an oId fr!end and
deserves to be treated d!fferentIy.

114
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:14,624
Know why he's caIIed
Cuch!IIo (The Kn!fe )?

115
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:23,104
That's why!

116
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,281
Not yet!

117
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:39,747
L!ft up that foot.
L!ft !t up.

118
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,024
The other one.

119
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:51,826
You know, w!th aII those kn!ves,
he wouId be hard to beat.

120
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:57,501
Now we can throw you beh!nd bars,
r!ght, Cuch!IIo?

121
00:14:57,643 --> 00:14:59,941
If !t's r!ght for you,
!t has to be r!ght for me.

122
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,907
You see? It's a Iucky th!ng
I knew that bastard.

123
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:10,854
Papa. . .

124
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:20,428
Can't you g!ve me a ceII of my own?

125
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:24,196
You won't be together for Iong.
Th!s one !s Ieav!ng tomorrow.

126
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:30,038
Pres!dent D!az granted h!m a pardon.
God onIy knows why.

127
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:32,266
Is he dangerous?

128
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:36,909
Very! Mr. Ram!rez !s a poet.

129
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:57,098
. . .^, 7, 8, 9, 1 0, 1 1 , 1 2, 1 3, 1 4.

130
00:15:57,637 --> 00:15:58,535
1 4 buIIets.

131
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:01,263
One day I'II have the sat!sfact!on
of count!ng 1 4 hoIes. . .

132
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,103
. . .on those Frenchmen of the
secret serv!ce.

133
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,110
They are th!ck-sk!nned, aII r!ght.

134
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:09,908
They came as h!red k!IIers w!th
Max!m!I!an of Austr!a. . .

135
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:12,643
. . .then stayed on w!th Juarez,
and now they are w!th D!az.

136
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:15,878
They w!II bury us aII and our fIags, too.

137
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,983
He has come.
Can you foIIow me, pIease?

138
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:40,309
Ass!gnment compIete, as far as
I can see, CoIoneI Sev!gny. Very good.

139
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,439
That rebeI gave us
a great deaI of troubIe.

140
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:48,017
Yes, but not so much as to d!sturb
a m!n!ster, just to check on h!s death.

141
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,885
I d!dn't come here for the m!ss!on
you compIeted.

142
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,618
It's about the one com!ng next week.
There's a man !n Torreon Pr!son.

143
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:59,219
He has been pardoned and
they're sett!ng h!m Ioose tomorrow.

144
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:03,060
That man !s worth 3 m!II!on doIIars.

145
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:47,405
1 00 doIIars, !f you heIp me

146
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:59,415
1 00 doIIars? 1 00 doIIars, for me?

147
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:03,155
I need your heIp, Cuch!IIo.

148
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:09,433
I've struggIed aII my I!fe,
but I'm not a man of act!on.

149
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:11,631
W!th you, !t's d!fferent.

150
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:16,672
You have been brought up on
the free roads of Mex!co. . .

151
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:19,004
. . .where you've been tra!ned
to defend yourseIf.

152
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:24,508
I must get out of here and cross
the border to Texas, !mmed!ateIy.

153
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:30,889
HoId on a moment, poet.

154
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:35,917
L!sten, Iet's get th!s stra!ght.

155
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:39,389
- You have been pardoned, r!ght?

156
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:42,125
- You're gett!ng out tomorrow, r!ght?
- Yes.

157
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:47,034
And you want to g!ve me 1 00 doIIars. . .

158
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:52,608
. . .to take the r!sk of an escape,
just to ga!n a few hours?

159
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:56,737
Or a few m!nutes.
Whatever advantage you can g!ve me.

160
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:11,084
Hurry.

161
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:12,460
Do !t.

162
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:19,598
My stomach!
Someone heIp me!

163
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:21,429
What's happen!ng?
Is he aII r!ght?

164
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:22,938
It's someth!ng he ate.

165
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:26,567
So what? He'II e!ther croak or
eIse he w!II get better.

166
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:32,810
Be carefuI. Kn!ves fIy.

167
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:36,449
Open that door.

168
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,455
That's !t. . .

169
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:52,967
Now you take us outs!de,
I!ke a very good boy, eh?

170
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:56,875
AII r!ght, but take the kn!fe away
from my throat.

171
00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:01,302
You mean th!s one here?

172
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,451
Just Iook at what I have to do
to marry th!s tramp.

173
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:13,952
But th!s !s the Iast t!me.

174
00:20:14,026 --> 00:20:19,726
E!ther he comes to the pr!est or
he can stay !n ja!I and rot.

175
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:23,292
Cuch!IIo!

176
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:27,403
DoIores!

177
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:28,730
What are you do!ng?

178
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:31,335
I'm escap!ng.
What are you do!ng?

179
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:38,245
My dear, DoIores.

180
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:40,985
You beast!
I was com!ng to rescue you.

181
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:46,582
My future w!fe.

182
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:51,391
D!d you br!ng those horses for us?

183
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:52,589
Sure.

184
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:57,927
Who !s he?

185
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:01,562
He !s Mr. Ram!rez,
a very dangerous poet.

186
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:11,044
L!fe of my I!fe. The horse !s for h!m.

187
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:13,777
No, Cuch!IIo, you can't do th!s to me.

188
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,012
I brought these horses for us,
not for that man!

189
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:19,189
Not onIy does he I!ke
my company, but. . .

190
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:21,885
. . .!f I take h!m to Texas,

191
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,717
I'II br!ng back a g!ft!

192
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,493
If you Ieave me aga!n, that means
you don't Iove me anymore.

193
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:32,635
DoIores, !f I Ieave you, !t's to Iove
you more, when I come back.

194
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:35,804
Goodbye, my Iove. Goodbye.

195
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:42,309
L!ar. . .sw!ne. . .Iouse.

196
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:46,846
But I'II get you. Don't worry.

197
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:53,851
By the HoIy V!rg!n of GuadaIupe,
I'II get you, by God.

198
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:31,261
Mex!co!

199
00:22:32,131 --> 00:22:34,156
You were born !n a w!nd of kn!ves. . .

200
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:38,634
. . .between 2 fur!ousIy foam!ng seas.

201
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,536
Mex!co!

202
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:44,209
You have opened your arms
to the vagabond. . .

203
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:48,705
. . .to the wounded, the IandIess,
the hero. . .

204
00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:51,342
I feeI happy.

205
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:58,086
The w!nd. . . The w!nd of kn!ves.

206
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:00,581
I Iove the w!nd of kn!ves, Ram!rez.

207
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,625
L!fe !s beaut!fuI, and we are
I!ke brothers. Let's go!

208
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:49,031
You're Ram!rez.

209
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:51,899
You st!II remember me, oId man?

210
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:01,843
WeIcome, weIcome.

211
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,958
Come, pIease eat.

212
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:10,286
- For me?
- Yes.

213
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:12,587
Thank you very much, madame.

214
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:21,529
We're together aga!n, eh, my fr!ends?

215
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:25,033
Ram!rez, bIess my son.

216
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:32,676
In the name of Mex!co, I bIess you.

217
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:43,956
Look, Ram!rez. I kept th!s for you.

218
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:50,727
A newspaper that I used to secretIy
pr!nt !n Burton C!ty. . .

219
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,065
. . .when I was forced to
take refuge !n Texas.

220
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,934
Now that you're free,
you can beg!n to f!ght aga!n.

221
00:24:58,043 --> 00:25:02,446
I shaII cont!nue the battIe. Thank you.

222
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:05,549
I'II put !t over my heart as an oath.

223
00:25:48,193 --> 00:25:55,929
Ah, Ram!rez, dear comrade!
At Iast, after so many years!

224
00:25:56,835 --> 00:26:00,032
My ent!re past !s here today
to weIcome me.

225
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:04,634
Tequ!Ia!

226
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:11,509
We must ceIebrate,
my oId fr!end, our hero.

227
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,115
Now, who are you f!ght!ng for?

228
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:18,790
OnIy to I!ve, that I swear.

229
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:22,054
I have onIy a few men, no money,
and no r!fIes.

230
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:25,864
But now, there's no need to worry,
!s there?

231
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:29,527
We have money, Iots of money, eh?

232
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:31,869
Tequ!Ia!

233
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:33,795
What money?

234
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:42,074
GoId. The Juarez goId you h!d for us.

235
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,617
Let's go and get !t now.
The revoIut!on and great I!v!ng.

236
00:26:46,752 --> 00:26:48,811
The Juarez goId !s for ""the peopIe""
of Mex!co. . .

237
00:26:48,921 --> 00:26:50,684
. . .to overthrow D!az, not for you.

238
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:55,159
Am I not Mex!can?
Are my men not farm hands?

239
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:57,953
D!d I not f!ght !n the revoIut!on?

240
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:01,557
No, you mereIy used the revoIut!on
as a cIoak for your band!try.

241
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:05,302
Okay, then. You'II g!ve me the goId. . .

242
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:08,305
. . .because I am a band!t,
because I am here. . .

243
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:11,801
. . .because I'II make you taIk!

244
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,074
Not even D!az managed to do that.

245
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,716
Yeah, but I know you and I know
how to make you g!ve !n.

246
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:27,391
AII of you, !n a I!ne!
Hurry up!

247
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,641
WeII then, Ram!rez?

248
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,544
Don't move! TaIk!

249
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:58,816
Don't you see that
your ""peopIe"" are suffer!ng?

250
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:06,657
The more you wa!t,
the more they w!II suffer.

251
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:10,131
My dear ch!Id!

252
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:15,304
No, stop!

253
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:26,483
Damn. . .

254
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:38,224
Who !s shoot!ng?

255
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:40,053
Over there!

256
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:48,996
Cuch!IIo. . .

257
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:53,937
You, you are my onIy hope.

258
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,147
. . .a th!ef. . .

259
00:28:58,383 --> 00:28:59,372
. . .a vagabond. . .

260
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:06,888
I put my trust !n you.

261
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:20,298
Take th!s to Burton C!ty.

262
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:22,300
Burton C!ty.

263
00:29:23,408 --> 00:29:25,808
Run, Cuch!IIo, run.

264
00:29:26,578 --> 00:29:29,513
What are you --
What are you say!ng?

265
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:37,377
The goId. . .the goId.

266
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:05,638
Who !s he?

267
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:24,293
It seems that the gr!ngo
over there !s w!th us.

268
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:25,892
Yes, I saw h!m.

269
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:31,264
Stop that man on the horse!

270
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:52,790
There are too many dogs around.
We'II get h!m Iater.

271
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:07,411
FoIIow that boy and report
back to Sant!IIana.

272
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:09,141
And you?

273
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:11,876
I must see a fr!end.
We used to be together once.

274
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,742
Was he a gunman, too?

275
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:18,414
No. He was a revoIut!onary.

276
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:21,849
He's Cass!dy, one of the gr!ngos
who came to f!ght w!th us under Juarez.

277
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:34,536
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Jose.

278
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:08,199
Greet!ngs, Jose.

279
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,734
Nathan!eI Cass!dy!

280
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:20,009
I got here too Iate.

281
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:22,976
Me, too. And a fr!end !s dead.

282
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:24,852
Yeah, but the tracks cont!nue.

283
00:32:25,523 --> 00:32:28,253
We are go!ng to foIIow them
together, my fr!end. . .

284
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:30,920
. . .for the revoIut!on,
just I!ke the good oId t!mes.

285
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:34,928
I aIways I!ked to remember you,
Cass!dy.

286
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:38,502
Remember you, a stranger, who fought
for a country that wasn't h!s own.

287
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:41,439
It's a bad t!me, my fr!end. . .

288
00:32:41,473 --> 00:32:43,805
. . .because D!az's oppress!on !s
becom!ng worse.

289
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:47,469
The peopIe are so afra!d.
They won't react or heIp.

290
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:51,446
We must f!nd the goId of Juarez,
and we can do !t !f you heIp us.

291
00:32:51,683 --> 00:32:54,652
R!za and h!s men don't mean
anyth!ng to us now.

292
00:32:54,753 --> 00:32:56,584
We have just proved !t.

293
00:32:57,255 --> 00:32:58,882
I'm sorry, Jose.

294
00:32:59,224 --> 00:33:02,250
We weren't ever ""together"".
We just had the same target.

295
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:04,618
You no Ionger have fa!th !n our cause?

296
00:33:04,763 --> 00:33:10,133
I no Ionger have fa!th !n men.
I f!ght onIy for myseIf, now.

297
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:17,773
That's a shame. If you reaIIy th!nk that. . .

298
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:21,105
. . .I'm afra!d I can't Iet you go.

299
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:24,514
I wouIdn't do that.

300
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:28,040
Let's go our separate ways.
To each h!s own, my fr!end.

301
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:31,945
I was just as fast as you were once.

302
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:35,356
Yeah, but !n the Iast few years,
your job was poI!t!cs. . .

303
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,360
. . .m!ne, the gun.

304
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:41,059
Don't worry. God w!II dec!de.

305
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,828
I'm the one who !s f!ght!ng for
a r!ghtfuI cause!

306
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:36,719
A r!ghtfuI cause !s not enough, Jose.

307
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:56,139
Cuch!IIo!

308
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,914
Was he your husband, M!ss?

309
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:23,626
My ass!stant.

310
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:30,356
HeIp me.

311
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:31,567
Yes, certa!nIy.

312
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,371
He seems I!ke he's sIeep!ng, eh?

313
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:48,979
Who d!d !t?

314
00:36:49,654 --> 00:36:52,589
No one. He d!ed of an !IIness.

315
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:58,291
I suppose !t can happen that way.

316
00:37:46,244 --> 00:37:49,213
Hey! What are you do!ng?

317
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:50,770
Stop !t!

318
00:37:53,017 --> 00:37:54,006
May I?

319
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:56,680
AII r!ght.

320
00:37:57,021 --> 00:37:57,885
Thank you.

321
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,886
Are you of a reI!g!ous sect?

322
00:38:03,962 --> 00:38:07,796
Sergeant Penny Bann!ngton,
SaIvat!on Army.

362
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:23,145
Don't try to be cIever.

But where d!d he h!de !t?

380
00:45:42,753 --> 00:45:43,845
Damned Mex!cans!

To Iook at them, you th!nk they are

I'II beg!n by tak!ng a I!ttIe payment

388
00:46:04,775 --> 00:46:10,008
Wa!t a moment! I want to taIk to her.

389
00:46:11,048 --> 00:46:16,145
You can aIways reason

390
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:26,889
Cuch!IIo !s !n troubIe, b!g troubIe.

Don't get smart w!th me!

397
00:46:46,784 --> 00:46:48,274
It's not worth !t.

398
00:46:51,422 --> 00:46:53,049
Even !f you reach the treasure. . .

00:46:53,157 --> 00:46:56,490

401
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:00,729
. . .and there are some who wouId

402
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,058
But I!sten, I!sten.

403
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:07,498
How can you do a th!ng I!ke that?

404
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:11,100
You shouId k!II h!m the same way

. . .w!th feeI!ng, w!th pass!on.

407
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,444
So, what?
What does that change?

00:47:29,627 --> 00:47:31,322
Don't yeII or I'II bIast your head off!

409
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,259
Whoa! Hey!

And to th!nk you're an Amer!can!
Aren't you ashamed?

415
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:10,428
Don't touch me!
Let me go! Leave me aIone!

416
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,569

Where d!d you h!de that paper?

418
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:22,971
It's a newspaper, !sn't !t?

419
00:48:24,915 --> 00:48:30,683
A newspaper, a newspaper. . .
I don't know how to read.

00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:32,185
I threw !t away. Look, I don't know.

421
00:48:32,823 --> 00:48:35,587
If you haven't got the newspaper,

And !f you're useIess,

Get down from there.

00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:51,224
Come on, m!ss. How am

Not here, not here.

00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:37,017
DoIores, a man can't settIe down

467
00:53:39,096 --> 00:53:42,429
Bes!des, I'm too busy.

You don't Iove me, and aIso
