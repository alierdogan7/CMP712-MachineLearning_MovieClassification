THE ROADS WE TAKE

11
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,936
We ain't got long to wait here.
They'll be on our trail.

12
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,330
What are we going to do
about a hoss for you, Bob?

13
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,030
Oh, I guess that can use of
yours'll  carry double for a while.

14
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,230
We'll annex the first animal
we come across.

15
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,740
By jingoes, we made a haul,
didn't we?

16
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,600
According to the marks
on this money there's 30,000 –

17
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,170
15,000 apiece!

18
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,920
It's short of what I expected.

19
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,650
Old Bolivar's mighty nigh played out,

20
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,330
I wish that sorrel of yours hadn't got hurt.

21
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,830
So do I, but it can't be helped.

22
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,606
Bolivar will get us both far enough
to get fresh mounts.

23
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:55,990
What a pity!

24
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,810
Dang it, Shark, I can't help thinking
how funny it is  that an Easterner
like you can come out here

25
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,410
and give us Western fellows cards
and spades in the desperado business.

26
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,310
What part of the East was
you from, anyway?

27
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,222
What?

28
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:14,545
I say, what part of
the East was you from?

29
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,290
- I'm from New York State.
- New York?

30
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,003
I got here by sheer luck.

31
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,890
I was walking along the road
with my clothes in a bundle,

32
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,020
making for New York City.

33
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,890
I had an idea of going there
and making lots of money.

34
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,130
I always felt like I could do it.

35
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:58,210
I came to a place where the road forked
and I didn't know which fork to take.

36
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,450
I studied about it for half an hour,
and then I took the left-hand.

37
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,560
and I went West with it.

38
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:14,840
Well done!

39
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,765
I've often wondered...

40
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:32,970
if I wouldn't have turned out
different if I'd took the other road.

41
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,275
Oh, I reckon you'd have
ended up about the same.

42
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:40,810
It ain't the roads we take,

43
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,530
it's what's inside of us that makes
us turn out the way we do.

44
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,330
I'd a good deal rather that sorrel
of yours hadn't hurt himself, Bob.

45
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,100
Same here,

46
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:12,130
he was sure a first-rate
kind of a crowbait.

47
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,370
But Bolivar, he'll pull us
through all right.

48
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,850
Reckon we'd better be moving on,
hadn't we, Shark?

49
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,450
- Stop your funning! We got to be hitting
the breeze. - Set still!

50
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,970
Set still! You ain't going
to hit no breeze, Bob.

51
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,610
I hate to tell you, but there ain't
any chance for but one of us.

52
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,010
Bolivar, he's plenty tired,
and he can't carry double.

53
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,355
We been pards, me and you,
for three year, Shark Dodson.

54
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:05,990
We've risked our lives together
time and again.

55
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,470
I've always give you a square deal,
and I thought you was a man.

56
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,959
I've heard some queer stories

57
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,715
about you shooting one or
two men in a peculiar way,

58
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:14,870
but I never believed 'em.

59
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,285
You don't know how bad I feel,

60
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:19,630
about that sorrel of yourn
breaking his leg, Bob.

61
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,238
Now if you're just having a little
fun with me, Shark,

62
00:09:22,356 --> 00:09:23,450
put your gun up.

63
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,050
If you mean to shoot – shoot!

64
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,590
Shoot, you blackhearted son
of a tarantula!

65
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,220
Bolivar cannot carry double.

66
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,342
Ahem! Peabody,

67
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:03,130
I must have fallen asleep?

68
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,230
Yes, sir.

69
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,710
I had a most remarkable dream.

70
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,279
What is it, Peabody?

71
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,930
Mr. Williams, sir, is outside.

72
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,999
He has come to settle his deal.

73
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,790
The market caught him
short, sir, if you remember.

74
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,030
Yes, I remember.

75
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,950
What is quoted at today?
– One eighty-five, sir.

76
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,510
Then that's his price.

77
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,755
Excuse me, sir, but he say he's
an old friend of yours, Mr. Dodson,

78
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:52,790
and he would like to speak with you...

79
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,290
And he's waiting...

80
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,790
- Okay. Let him in.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,190
Williams...

82
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,110
Listen, Dodson,
we been pards, me and you...

83
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,960
I've always give you
a square deal.

84
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:19,525
I'm very sorry that it happened...

85
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,590
You bought up all stocks.

86
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,490
I think you might...

87
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,510
If you remember
I sold you the stock at 98.

88
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,315
Yes, I remember...

89
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:42,190
...at 98.

90
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,240
Listen Dodson, if I
settle at the market price,

91
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,640
as you are asking me to do,
I will lose money - be ruined!

92
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,670
This would be my downfall.
I ask you, please...

93
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,670
Please...

94
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,236
I hate to tell you,

95
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,930
but there ain't
any chance for you.

96
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,510
One eighty-five.

97
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,590
Bolivar cannot carry double.

98
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,200
MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD KIN

99
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,120
Lay still! I say lay still!

100
00:21:26,755 --> 00:21:27,810
Hands up!

101
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,819
Up with the other one.

102
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,533
You might be amphibious
and shoot with your left.

103
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,731
You can count two,
can't you?

104
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:35,950
Hurry up,

105
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:36,850
now!

106
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,330
- Can't raise the other one.
- What's the matter with it?

107
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,570
Rheumatism...

108
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,410
in the shoulder.

109
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,530
Inflammatory?

110
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,377
Was...

111
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,950
The inflammation has gone down.

112
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,495
Don't stand there making faces,

113
00:22:14,696 --> 00:22:16,530
If you've come to burgle
why don't you do it?

114
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,730
There's some stuff lying around.

115
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,430
Excuse me,
it's good for you

116
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:27,215
that rheumatism and me
happens to be old pals.

117
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:28,883
I got it in my
left arm, too.

118
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,930
Most anybody but me
would have popped you

119
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,650
when you wouldn't hoist
that left claw of yours.

120
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,275
Tell me please, how long
have you had it?

121
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,440
Four years...

122
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:49,321
I guess that ain't all.

123
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,730
Once you've got it, it's you for
a rheumatic life – that's my judgment.

124
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,970
- Well, ever try rattlesnake oil?
- Gallons,

125
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,840
If all the snakes I've used the oil
of was strung out in a row

126
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,450
they'd reach eight times
as far as Saturn and back.

127
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,860
- Some use Chiselum's Pills.
- Fudge!

128
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,610
Took 'em five months. No good.

129
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,930
I had some relief the year I tried
Finkelham's Extract... - Finkelhait's.

130
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,760
Yes, Finkelhait's... and when
I used Potts's Pain Pulverizer,

131
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,090
I felt oneself better.

132
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,410
But I think it was the buckeye

133
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,330
I carried in my pocket
what done the trick.

134
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,770
Is yours worse in the morning
or at night?

135
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,015
Night, just when I'm busiest.

136
00:23:57,616 --> 00:23:59,490
Say, take down that arm of yours.

137
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:04,672
Say! Did you ever try..?

138
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:05,999
Damn!...

139
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:09,456
Forgot...

140
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:18,450
Here is it...

141
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:25,450
- Ahem! Blickerstaff's
Blood Builder... - Did you?

142
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,270
Blickerstaff's...

143
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,990
- You know, I never did.
- It's a pity.

144
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,750
Does yours come in paroxysms
or is it a steady pain?

145
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,740
It jumps...

146
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:47,385
It strikes me when
I ain't looking for it.

147
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,131
I had to give up second-story work

148
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:54,440
because I got stuck
sometimes half-way up.

149
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,390
- I see!
- Tell you what -

150
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,990
I don't believe the blooming doctors
know what is good for it. - Same here.

151
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,630
I've spent a thousand dollars
without getting any relief.

152
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,070
- Yours swell any?
- Of mornings.

153
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,710
And when it's going to rain -
great Christopher! - Me, too...

154
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,910
I can tell when a streak of humidity
the size of a table-cloth

155
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,400
starts from Florida and...

156
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:40,910
with the approach of it,
I began to feel badly,

157
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,910
And if I pass a theatre
where there's

158
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,790
the moisture starts my left arm
an 'East Lynne' matinee going on,

159
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,750
jumping like a toothache.
- It's undiluted - hades!

160
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,550
You're dead right.

161
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,670
Say, old man,
ever try opodeldoc?

162
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,150
Slop! Might as well rub
on restaurant butter.

163
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,475
Sure, It's a salve
suitable for little Minnie

164
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:46,510
when the kitty
scratches her finger.

165
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,510
- Sure?
- Sure.

166
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,352
I'll tell you what!
We're up against it.

167
00:27:03,353 --> 00:27:04,740
You are right.

168
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,150
- I only find one thing that
helps in our life. - Fomentations?

169
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,950
Saint Ignatius' nut?

170
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,685
Well, it's a...

171
00:27:20,386 --> 00:27:22,290
Good Booze..! Eh?!

172
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,620
Don't take umbrage at me.
Say, this job's off -

173
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,080
get on your clothes
and let's go out and have some.

174
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:32,116
The devil take it!

175
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,990
For a week I haven't been able
to dress myself without help.

176
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,528
I'm afraid Thomas is in bed, and...

177
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:40,750
Climb out, I'll help
you get into your duds.

178
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,990
You know, it's very unusual...

179
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,030
- Here's your shirt.
- Of course.

180
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,910
I knew a man who said Omberry's
Ointment fixed him in two weeks

181
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,590
so he could use both hands
in tying his four-in-hand.

182
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,790
Liked to forgot my money,
laid it on the dresser last night.

183
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,030
Come on. I ask you. Leave it alone.
I've got the price.

184
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,910
Ever try the urine of young pig?

185
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,500
Young? It's interesting...

186
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,210
You know, my uncle...

187
00:30:14,386 --> 00:30:17,034
THE RANSOM OF RED CHIEF

188
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:20,762
Ahem! It's you...
How are you, Sam?

189
00:31:23,268 --> 00:31:27,214
- You know, we have joint capital
of about... - Five hundred dollars.

190
00:31:27,695 --> 00:31:30,685
That's just the point.
We cannot begin new business...

191
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:31,781
with such money.

192
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,417
To pull off a fraudulent scheme
in Western Illinois, we need more...

193
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,377
...Two thousand dollars.
- But where will we get it?

194
00:31:38,787 --> 00:31:39,618
I know...

195
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:45,899
I have one brilliant idea.
2000 dollars that is easy as pie.

196
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:48,820
- Bank robbery?
- No.

197
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,421
Express robbery?

198
00:31:51,481 --> 00:31:54,942
Oh Bill, I am tired of fussing
like this. Listen closely...

199
00:31:55,972 --> 00:31:56,770
The love of children...

200
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:01,513
The love of children...
It is strong in semi-rural communities.

201
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:05,627
Did you get me?
- No.

202
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:08,702
Kid...

203
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:14,537
Kidnapping.

204
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:23,379
Sam!

205
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:16,242
The money is ours in fact.

206
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:21,243
I've never been engaged in such
business but I think we can risk.

207
00:33:21,523 --> 00:33:23,724
No risk. It is easy and simple.

208
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:29,365
While you had loafed about,
I had paved the way for it.

209
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:33,366
Listen to me closely.

210
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:36,647
I have selected for our victim
the only child of a prominent citizen.

211
00:33:37,688 --> 00:33:40,208
His name is Ebenezer Dorset.

212
00:33:40,368 --> 00:33:43,586
The pop will take out nothing less
than two thousand dollars for his kid.

213
00:33:43,686 --> 00:33:44,949
Don't disturb!

214
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:50,131
Tomorrow we'll rent a carrriage
in the neighbouring village.

215
00:33:51,451 --> 00:33:54,122
The Dorset's home is uptown.

216
00:33:54,612 --> 00:33:56,052
In the afternoon we'll go
to the country,..

217
00:33:58,154 --> 00:33:59,993
...take the precious kid...

218
00:34:01,295 --> 00:34:04,244
...and hide him in a cave.

219
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:08,996
Next we'll write a letter
to pop about ransom...

220
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:11,216
...and get money.

221
00:34:13,777 --> 00:34:16,337
The snot-nosed kid
will be back home...

222
00:34:16,738 --> 00:34:18,898
...and we'll go to Western Illinois
to pull an our scheme off.

223
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:23,419
You're a bad man on strategy tricks.

224
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:30,341
I am ready!

225
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:41,934
Meow!

226
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:35,027
That's 2000 that lies at our feet.

227
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:37,928
I'm sure we'll take 'em easy.

228
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,628
Hey, boy!
- Easier!

229
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,085
Hey, little boy!

230
00:35:46,115 --> 00:35:49,521
Would you like to have a bag
of candy and a nice ride?

231
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,900
Wow!

232
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:10,251
That will cost the old Dorset
an extra five hundred dollars.

233
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:15,118
Take the boy to the cave
and I'll return the carriage.

234
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:17,789
– You don't think he'll run away?
– No fear of it.

235
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,870
Boy!

236
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,551
Boy!

237
00:38:35,383 --> 00:38:38,854
Bill!

238
00:38:47,246 --> 00:38:51,237
– Do you live in the woods?
– Yes, in the woods, boy!..

239
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:56,328
Don't frighten a baby. More ease...
In the woods, little boy.

240
00:38:57,116 --> 00:38:58,855
– Are there any real Indians
here? – Who?

241
00:38:59,123 --> 00:39:03,121
–  Indians. –  No, there are
no Indians here.

242
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,531
– Are you afraid, boy?
– Me? Afraid?

243
00:39:07,771 --> 00:39:09,732
I am a Red Chief indeed!

244
00:39:16,013 --> 00:39:17,294
Got it?

245
00:39:21,015 --> 00:39:23,085
Keep an eye on him! Quickly!

246
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:46,181
Wait!

247
00:39:48,582 --> 00:39:51,462
Ha! Cursed paleface,

248
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:58,584
do you dare to enter
the camp of Red Chief?

249
00:40:02,665 --> 00:40:07,536
Hey you, Snake-eye! When my braves
returned from the warpath

250
00:40:08,187 --> 00:40:12,548
you'll be broiled at the stake
at the rising of the sun.

251
00:40:12,988 --> 00:40:15,348
Go! Be ready to be punished.

252
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:22,400
Go!

253
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:33,063
And what?

254
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:40,155
He's all right now. We're playing Indian.
I'm Old Hank, the Trapper,

255
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:46,226
Red Chief's captive, and
I'm to be scalped at daybreak.

256
00:40:52,278 --> 00:40:55,108
And I heard you'll be
broiled at the stake.

257
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,630
By Geronimo!
That kid can kick hard!

258
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:09,872
Red Chief! Welcome to wigwam.

259
00:41:16,084 --> 00:41:18,232
I like this fine.

260
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,555
I never camped out before.

261
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:31,688
We had five puppies.

262
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:40,120
– Why you have such a red nose,Hank?
– Because... – Hist!

263
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:45,801
Hist, buddy!
I think there are spies there...

264
00:42:07,577 --> 00:42:10,808
Never mind! He's just a kid.

265
00:42:13,578 --> 00:42:18,780
– Good boy. We was lucky.
– To be sure!

266
00:42:38,385 --> 00:42:41,375
– What about spies?
– Everything is all right!

267
00:42:43,546 --> 00:42:49,097
Why are oranges round?
Why nothing in holes?

268
00:42:50,188 --> 00:42:52,068
I don't like girls.

269
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:01,471
My father has lots of money.

270
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:13,554
Are the trees moving
make the wind blow?

271
00:43:18,275 --> 00:43:21,986
Red Chief, would you
like to go home?

272
00:43:22,236 --> 00:43:24,546
Aw, what for?

273
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:29,628
I don't have any fun at home.
I hate to go to school.

274
00:43:30,118 --> 00:43:32,919
I like to camp out.

275
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,310
You won't take me back home
again, Snake-eye, will you?

276
00:43:42,641 --> 00:43:47,162
Not right away. We'll stay
here in the cave a while.

277
00:43:47,642 --> 00:43:50,473
All right! That'll be fine.

278
00:44:37,015 --> 00:44:39,765
– What happened?
– Psst! Psst, buddy.

279
00:44:41,176 --> 00:44:44,537
– If you will not sleep now,
tomorrow I... – What tomorrow?

280
00:44:45,177 --> 00:44:47,537
Sleep! Now!

281
00:50:01,417 --> 00:50:03,938
Why are you getting up
so soon for, Sam?

282
00:50:05,738 --> 00:50:08,619
Me? Oh, I got a kind
of a pain in my shoulder.

283
00:50:10,499 --> 00:50:13,300
I thought sitting up would rest it.

284
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:17,701
You're a liar!.. You're afraid...

285
00:50:24,783 --> 00:50:30,754
You were to be burned at sunrise,
and you were afraid he'd do it.

286
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:35,166
– Ha! You are kidding...
– And he would, too,..

287
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:38,066
if he could find a match.
– Are you sure?

288
00:50:48,569 --> 00:50:52,200
Do you think anybody will pay out money
to get a little imp like that back home?

289
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:55,571
– Okay.
– Are you sure?

290
00:50:56,771 --> 00:50:58,572
Adsolutely!

291
00:50:59,652 --> 00:51:05,063
A rowdy kid like that is just
the kind that parents dote on.

292
00:51:10,094 --> 00:51:14,005
Now, you and the Chief get up
and cook breakfast, relax...

293
00:51:15,056 --> 00:51:16,166
...while I'll to scout out.

294
00:51:16,312 --> 00:51:17,289
Oh, I go away...

295
00:51:17,966 --> 00:51:19,467
Sam, maybe I'll to scout out?

296
00:51:19,637 --> 00:51:24,108
No, no, no... I'll go to reconnoitre.
Don't worry!

297
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:27,069
– Okay.
– Relax!

298
00:51:38,782 --> 00:51:40,032
Well, I go...

299
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:05,640
What's the matter?
Give back a rock!

300
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,803
I'll get you!

301
00:58:58,093 --> 00:59:02,804
No man ever yet struck the Red Chief
but what he got paid for it.

302
00:59:06,015 --> 00:59:08,326
You'd better beware me!

303
00:59:08,436 --> 00:59:11,036
What's he up to now?

304
00:59:11,537 --> 00:59:15,638
You don't think he'll run
away, do you, Sam?

305
00:59:17,098 --> 00:59:20,699
No fear of it. He don't seem
to be much of a home body.

306
00:59:35,423 --> 00:59:37,160
There don't seem to be much
excitement around town

307
00:59:37,165 --> 00:59:38,873
on account of his
disappearance.

308
00:59:39,664 --> 00:59:43,625
His folks may think he's spending
the night with one of the neighbours.

309
00:59:44,745 --> 00:59:47,786
Anyhow, he'll be missed today.

310
01:01:02,165 --> 01:01:06,156
If you don't behave,
I'll take you straight home!

311
01:01:10,647 --> 01:01:12,767
Now, are you going
to be good, or not?

312
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:27,111
Are you going to be good after all?

313
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:29,287
I was only having fun,

314
01:01:29,488 --> 01:01:31,122
I didn't mean to hurt Old Hank.

315
01:01:32,432 --> 01:01:34,223
But what did he hit me for?

316
01:01:35,753 --> 01:01:38,554
Okay, I'll behave, Snake-eye,

317
01:01:39,274 --> 01:01:41,655
if you won't send me home,

318
01:01:41,956 --> 01:01:44,035
and if you'll let me play
the Black Scout today.

319
01:01:46,116 --> 01:01:48,186
What?
– The Black Scout game.

320
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:54,933
Listen to me carefully.

321
01:01:55,134 --> 01:01:57,022
I don't know the game.

322
01:01:57,323 --> 01:01:58,909
That's for you and Mr. Bill to decide.

323
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,961
Now, you come in and make friends with him
and say you are sorry for hurting him.

324
01:02:05,921 --> 01:02:06,961
Well, let's go!

325
01:02:07,961 --> 01:02:11,482
Or home you go, at once.

326
01:02:12,683 --> 01:02:16,644
He's nice guy, very kind but you had hurt
him when you hit him with a rock.

327
01:02:33,648 --> 01:02:37,489
I'm sorry, Old Hank.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

328
01:02:37,809 --> 01:02:41,930
You didn't... I know...
Well, shake each other's hands.

329
01:02:56,414 --> 01:03:01,125
– Well, you can take a walk
and be a good boy.
– I will stay and protect the cave.

330
01:03:02,575 --> 01:03:06,966
Of course! You may do it,
our invaluable friend.
Well, time to take action.

331
01:03:08,737 --> 01:03:13,288
And now we'll write the letter
to old Dorset.

332
01:03:16,339 --> 01:03:21,250
Ebenezer Dorset, Esq.:

333
01:03:36,044 --> 01:03:39,194
Please, Sam make the ransom fifteen
hundred dollars instead of two thousand.

334
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:44,896
It ain't human for anybody
to give up two thousand dollars

335
01:03:45,386 --> 01:03:47,382
for that forty-pound
chunk of freckled wildcat.

336
01:03:47,683 --> 01:03:49,377
Let be fifteen hundred dollars.

337
01:03:51,348 --> 01:03:53,608
You can charge the difference up to me.

338
01:03:53,909 --> 01:03:56,799
Please, Sam!

339
01:03:57,309 --> 01:03:59,750
Okay... Have it your way.

340
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:04,351
Thank you. You're always
were a true friend.

341
01:04:08,272 --> 01:04:12,743
Listen to me carefully!
"Ebenezer Dorset, Esq.

342
01:04:15,154 --> 01:04:19,115
We have your boy concealed
in a place far from this city.

343
01:04:20,555 --> 01:04:25,146
Absolutely, the only terms
on which you can have him
restored to you are these:

344
01:04:25,356 --> 01:04:26,246
Listen and be attentive!

345
01:04:27,037 --> 01:04:30,878
We demand two thousand
dollars for his return.

346
01:04:30,998 --> 01:04:33,038
Fifteen hundred dollars, Sam!

347
01:04:33,998 --> 01:04:36,969
Oh, sorry. You're right!
Fifteen hundred dollars...

348
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:43,231
If you agree to these terms, send your
answer in writing by a solitary messenger

349
01:04:43,761 --> 01:04:48,552
to-night at half-past eight o'clock,
where you'll put later on

350
01:04:49,122 --> 01:04:52,563
two thousand dollars.
– Fifteen hundred dollars, Sam!

351
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:55,564
Oh, sorry again, Bill!
Fifteen hundred dollars...

352
01:04:57,444 --> 01:05:02,236
More precisely, after crossing Owl Creek,
on the road to Poplar Cove...

353
01:05:15,249 --> 01:05:19,640
I never lost my nerve yet till we kidnapped
that two-legged skyrocket of a kid.

354
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:23,081
He's got me going. – Don't worry.
Everything will go well.

355
01:05:24,281 --> 01:05:27,092
You won't leave me here alone
with him, will you, Sam?

356
01:05:27,932 --> 01:05:33,293
I'll be back some time this afternoon. You must
keep the boy amused and quiet till I return.

357
01:05:34,234 --> 01:05:37,594
Okay. I'm ready.

358
01:05:43,176 --> 01:05:45,917
Aw, Snake-eye, you said
I could play the Black Scout...

359
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:47,247
...while you were gone.

360
01:05:48,297 --> 01:05:51,768
Play it, of course,
Mr. Bill will play with you.

361
01:05:53,338 --> 01:05:55,249
What kind of a game is it?

362
01:05:55,499 --> 01:05:59,700
– Yes, what kind of a game is it?
– I'm the Black Scout and I have
to ride to the stockade

363
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:03,301
to warn the settlers
that the Indians are coming.

364
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:07,542
I'm tired of playing Indian myself.
I want to be the Black Scout.

365
01:06:10,483 --> 01:06:13,444
All right.
It sounds harmless to me.

366
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:20,835
I guess Mr. Bill will help you
foil the pesky savages.

367
01:06:21,296 --> 01:06:22,796
What am I to do?

368
01:06:23,197 --> 01:06:24,296
You are the hoss.

369
01:06:25,227 --> 01:06:28,447
Get down on all fours!
– Oh, time to go...

370
01:06:28,627 --> 01:06:31,908
How can I ride to the stockade
without a hoss?

371
01:06:32,278 --> 01:06:33,299
Of course...

372
01:06:33,775 --> 01:06:36,199
You'd better keep him interested

373
01:06:36,299 --> 01:06:39,470
till we get the scheme going.
Loosen up.

374
01:06:53,714 --> 01:06:55,869
How far is it to the stockade, kid?

375
01:06:56,270 --> 01:07:00,901
Ninety miles. And you have
to hump yourself to get there on time.

376
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,796
Gee, now!

377
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:15,279
Hurry back, Sam, as soon as you can.

378
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:21,961
I wish we hadn't made the ransom
more than a thousand.

379
01:07:22,841 --> 01:07:24,802
Gee up!

380
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:28,042
Say, you quit kicking me...

381
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:31,043
...or I'll get up and warm you good.

382
01:07:31,243 --> 01:07:33,314
Forward!

383
01:08:15,735 --> 01:08:18,987
Our city is very peaceful.

384
01:08:19,389 --> 01:08:22,241
We have no any accidents here in fact.

385
01:08:22,736 --> 01:08:24,127
Yes, nice small town.

386
01:08:24,497 --> 01:08:27,618
But whole city was shocked to-day.

387
01:08:28,498 --> 01:08:30,318
What happened?

388
01:08:31,219 --> 01:08:37,070
One of the very respectable
citizens Mr. Ebenezer Dorset...

389
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,170
What?

390
01:08:39,221 --> 01:08:41,941
Ebenezer Dorset...
– Uh! And what about him?

391
01:08:42,301 --> 01:08:45,212
– ...either lost or it was stolen...
– Wallet?

392
01:08:45,462 --> 01:08:47,333
No! His only son.

393
01:08:48,444 --> 01:08:50,623
Really? Is it possible?

394
01:08:51,384 --> 01:08:53,554
Oh my God!

395
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:56,525
But what our President is doing?

396
01:09:58,881 --> 01:10:00,551
Bill!

397
01:10:06,783 --> 01:10:09,453
Bill! Bill!

398
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:24,512
Sam, I suppose you'll
think I'm a renegade...

399
01:10:24,713 --> 01:10:27,458
...but I couldn't help it.

400
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,273
Where is the boy?

401
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:46,528
Where is he?

402
01:10:47,863 --> 01:10:52,864
The boy is gone.
I have sent him home.

403
01:10:55,715 --> 01:10:58,076
What? You sent him home?!

404
01:10:59,836 --> 01:11:02,277
It is all off.

405
01:11:03,117 --> 01:11:07,748
Believe me, Sam, nobody ever was subjugated
to such supernatural tortures as I have been.

406
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:13,240
I tried to be faithful
to our articles of depredation;

407
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,520
but there came a limit.

408
01:11:29,484 --> 01:11:32,765
What's the trouble, Bill?

409
01:11:33,805 --> 01:11:37,596
Well, I rode the ninety miles
to the stockade, not barring an inch.

410
01:11:38,606 --> 01:11:41,437
Then, when the settlers were rescued,
I was given oats.

411
01:11:41,687 --> 01:11:46,478
Sand ain't a palatable substitute. I tell you,
a human can only stand so much!

412
01:11:47,408 --> 01:11:51,559
I take him by the neck and drag him down
the mountain. On the way he kicks my legs;

413
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:57,001
and I've got two or three bites
on my thumb and hand cauterized.

414
01:11:58,091 --> 01:12:01,082
But he's gone. Gone home.
– Gone...

415
01:12:01,452 --> 01:12:03,732
I'm sorry we lose the ransom,

416
01:12:03,972 --> 01:12:07,413
But it was either that
or Bill Driscoll to the madhouse.

417
01:12:09,374 --> 01:12:11,574
– That's all.
– All?

418
01:12:13,935 --> 01:12:16,606
Life is beautiful!

419
01:12:25,498 --> 01:12:29,209
Bill, there isn't any heart disease
in your family, is there?

420
01:12:29,499 --> 01:12:33,519
– What? – I say, there isn't
any heart disease in your family?

421
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:38,461
No, nothing chronic
except malaria and accidents.

422
01:12:38,647 --> 01:12:40,139
– It's nothing!
– Nothing.

423
01:12:46,509 --> 01:12:50,157
– But why?
– It's doesn't matter.

424
01:12:50,264 --> 01:12:51,039
– So, nothing chronic?
– No.

425
01:14:12,245 --> 01:14:15,326
Two Desperate Men!

426
01:14:22,248 --> 01:14:23,883
Gentlemen:

427
01:14:27,285 --> 01:14:31,520
I received your letter today
by post in regard to the ransom

428
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:35,321
you ask for the return of my son.

429
01:14:35,416 --> 01:14:41,152
I hereby make you a counter-proposition, which
I am inclined to believe you will accept.

430
01:14:41,422 --> 01:14:42,293
Interestingly...

431
01:14:44,423 --> 01:14:50,852
You bring Johnny home and pay me
two hundred and fifty dollars in cash,

432
01:14:50,895 --> 01:14:51,955
and I...

433
01:15:01,978 --> 01:15:04,428
You bring Johnny home and pay me...

434
01:15:05,104 --> 01:15:06,429
To pay him?..

435
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:15,011
Pay me two hundred and fifty dollars in cash,
and I agree to take him off your hands.

436
01:15:16,341 --> 01:15:20,782
You had better come at night, for
the neighbours believe he is lost,

437
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:26,334
and I couldn't be responsible for what they
would do to anybody they saw bringing him back.

438
01:15:27,944 --> 01:15:31,255
Very respectfully,
Ebenezer Dorset.

439
01:15:34,146 --> 01:15:36,326
Barefaced impudence!

440
01:15:39,267 --> 01:15:42,548
Bill, we'll do the next...

441
01:15:46,189 --> 01:15:47,859
Bill!..

442
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:51,860
Bill!..

443
01:15:54,891 --> 01:16:00,312
Sam, what's two hundred and fifty dollars,
after all? We've got the money.

444
01:16:09,435 --> 01:16:13,036
One more night of this kid
will send me to a bed in Bedlam!

445
01:16:22,798 --> 01:16:26,589
Besides being a thorough gentleman,

446
01:16:27,559 --> 01:16:32,561
I think Mr. Dorset is a spendthrift
for making us such a liberal offer.

447
01:16:34,561 --> 01:16:36,562
Sam! Sam!

448
01:16:36,962 --> 01:16:42,003
You ain't going to let
the chance go, are you?

449
01:16:42,963 --> 01:16:46,644
Tell you the truth, Bill, this little lamb
has somewhat got on my nerves too.

450
01:16:47,024 --> 01:16:49,825
Sam, we'll take him home,

451
01:16:49,926 --> 01:16:51,455
pay the ransom...

452
01:16:53,106 --> 01:16:55,356
...and make our get-away.

453
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:01,628
Johnny...

454
01:17:04,729 --> 01:17:06,159
Wait! Wait, Johnny!

455
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:10,530
You know, your father had bought
you a silver-mounted rifle.

456
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,231
– Really?
– Really.

457
01:17:13,236 --> 01:17:15,251
Also, your father
had bought a pair of moccasins.

458
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:17,252
– Really?
– Really.

459
01:17:17,572 --> 01:17:20,173
And we are going to hunt
bears the next day!

460
01:17:20,373 --> 01:17:22,523
– Will Old Hank come too?
– You bet!

461
01:17:23,814 --> 01:17:28,655
Well, now we'll go to your father, then pass
the night and we'll go to hunt in the morning!

462
01:18:54,617 --> 01:18:57,187
Bill, hold on! Don't give up!

463
01:19:00,228 --> 01:19:02,389
How long can you hold him?

464
01:19:03,089 --> 01:19:07,490
I'm not as strong as I used to be,
but I think I can promise you ten minutes.

465
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,990
Enough...

466
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:12,251
...in ten minutes we'll be legging it
trippingly for the Canadian border.
