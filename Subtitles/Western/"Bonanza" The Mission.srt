00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,472
ANNOUNCER:
<i>The following program</i>

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:09,042
<i>is brought to you</i>
<i>in living color on NBC.</i>

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,773
(fanfare plays)

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,342
(men laughing in distance)

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,893
Now, now can I have that drink?

6
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:28,728
Not until you finish
your story, Charlie.

7
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,663
You have to tell us
about General Fremont.

8
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,499
Yes, let me see, where was I?

9
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,135
Oh, yeah, that was the time

10
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,570
that me and the general come
through here together.

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,141
That was in the summer of '47.

12
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,009
As a matter of fact,
there wouldn't have been

13
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,980
no Virginia City if it hadn't
been for me and the general.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,748
(laughter)

15
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,817
I told you to shut up
your lying, didn't I?

16
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:51,818
I ain't lying.

17
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,186
- You are lying.
- I... (groaning)

18
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,422
- Ain't you, ain't you?!
- Yes, sir, yes, sir.

19
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,390
Now, wait a minute, mister,

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,592
old Charlie here
don't mean any harm.

21
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,028
He's just an old man
hangin' around the saloon.

22
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,588
We like to hear his stories.

23
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,903
Well, I don't like to hear them.

24
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,362
Now, did anybody ask you
to put in your two bits' worth?

25
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,413
- (laughter) -Why don't
you fellas leave me be?

26
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,550
I tell you, I did scout
for General Fremont.

27
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,884
I tell you, I did.

28
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,686
Why don't you leave me be?

29
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,088
All right, old man.

30
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,183
Latigo, give me a knife.

31
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,762
What you aiming to do?

32
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,265
Well, now, anybody that's fought

33
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,901
as many Indians
as you claim you have

34
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,204
ought to have a few scars,
shouldn't he?

35
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,605
No.

36
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,275
Suppose we just scratch off
some of this beard and...

37
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,444
- Ow!
- (laughter)

38
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,712
- So's we can...
- (Charlie groans)

39
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,080
put on some war paint.

40
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,315
(men taunting,
talking over each other)

41
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,307
Leave him alone!

42
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,793
(panting)

43
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,785
(grunts)

44
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,249
Come on, Charlie.

45
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,451
Let's get you out of here before
you get in any more trouble.

46
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,888
Thank you, Hoss... thank ye.

47
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,836
My friend Charlie don't like
to be treated like that.

48
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,837
(sighs)

49
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,271
I don't like it neither.

50
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,786
You dropped something.

51
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,389
Yeah.

52
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,485
HOSS:
"Fremont Expedition, 1847."

53
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,831
"Presented to Charles Trent,

54
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,833
"chief scout,

55
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:25,430
for services above and beyond
the line of duty."

56
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,635
Charlie, you... you wouldn't
want to lose that.

57
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,688
(theme song playing)

58
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,465
You're about the only
real friend I got in town.

59
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,667
All I seem to do is
a-cause you trouble.

60
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,935
Charlie, you promised me solemn

61
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,570
you wasn't goin'
back in that saloon again.

62
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,238
Well, I-I didn't mean to.

63
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,375
Just them fellas wanted to hear
some of my stories, that's all.

64
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,876
Yeah, for a couple of drinks.

65
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,678
I guess...

66
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,214
I guess you won't give me
another chance, will you?

67
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,283
Dad-burnit, Charlie, how many
chances you gonna have to have?

68
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,885
I talked Pa into giving you
a job on the ranch.

69
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:46,919
And what do you do?

70
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,121
The first payday you take off

71
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,489
and we don't see you again
for a week,

72
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,690
and you come back drunk.

73
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,159
That was, that was
a mistake, Hoss.

74
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,428
Charlie, it's that way with
every job you got around here.

75
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,964
There ain't nobody around here
going to give you a chance now.

76
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,700
I, I guess you're right,

77
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,236
but I ain't gonna
to bother you no more,

78
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,837
I can promise you that much,

79
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,173
'cause I'm, I'm gonna take up
scouting again.

80
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,808
(chuckling):
Yeah.

81
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,544
General Fremont-- he'll be
sending for me any time now--

82
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,413
today, tomorrow for sure.

83
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,548
Charlie, I, I wouldn't count
on it too much.

84
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:18,184
General Fremont's a busy man
with, uh, this war talk and all.

85
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,953
Oh, I know, I know he,
he wouldn't go back on me.

86
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:24,023
You see, him and me--we crossed
the Great Salt Flat together.

87
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:27,927
I'd better, better go fix up
a little, though, I guess.

88
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,363
Charlie... it...
it just ain't no use.

89
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:34,567
I... I done made up my mind
what I'm gonna do with you.

90
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,369
- What? -Well, I'm,
I'm gonna go in there

91
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,138
and get some money and
I'm gonna, gonna fix you all up

92
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,773
nice and clean,
and I'm gonna put you

93
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,109
on the first stagecoach
out of here for San Francisco.

94
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:47,747
That's mighty kind of you,
Hoss, I, I appreciate it,

95
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,016
but I can't go to no big city.

96
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,117
(sniffs)

97
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,853
I belong out here,
I got to stay here.

98
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,189
Charlie, I, I been all wrong

99
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,257
about maybe you getting
a new chance here.

100
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,392
It's...

101
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,027
The big city's
the only place for you.

102
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,428
- I...
- You stay right here.

103
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,398
Don't you go no place, you hear?

104
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,301
Hoss!

105
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,802
CHARLIE (muttering):
Gone... Hoss...

106
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,794
Hold on, Cutter.

107
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,808
Where you going?

108
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,877
I heard a couple friends of mine
was passing through.

109
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,045
Thought I'd talk to 'em is all.

110
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,747
Well, I have a strict schedule
on this mission.

111
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,484
You be back here and ready
to lead out in one half hour.

112
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,487
- (Cutter laughs)
- Cutter.

113
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,156
Cap'n...

114
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,426
I think it's about time you
and me had us an understanding.

115
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,595
Now, I been loning it
through this territory

116
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,998
for a goodly time and I ain't
never taken no orders yet,

117
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,634
not from a savage
and not from no soldier boy.

118
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:45,304
You signed an army contract
to scout trail.

119
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,807
You're going to fulfill it--
and to the letter--

120
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,242
or you'll be relieved.

121
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,579
Why, mister,
you've got about as much chance

122
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,047
of crossing that desert
without me

123
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,750
as a blind hooty bat has
of reaching the sun.

124
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,421
(Cutter laughs)

125
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,455
All right, carry on, men.

126
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,723
(grunting)

127
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,159
Cap'n, Cap'n,
I know that whole desert.

128
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,728
I mapped out the first trail
to Salt Lake City.

129
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,563
I know the whereabouts
of every water hole.

130
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,565
Yeah, well,
I-I can't sign on anybody

131
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,300
just because they claim
to be a scout.

132
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,936
You don't, you don't,
you don't believe me, huh?

133
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,338
Yeah, yeah, look at that,
look at that.

134
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,476
Fremont Expedition?!

135
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:27,680
Yeah, you can read what's
written on the other side, too.

136
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,484
"Presented to Charles Trent,
chief scout,

137
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,853
for services..."

138
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,388
Trent?

139
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,822
Yeah.

140
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,293
Are you the same Trent
that scouted

141
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,662
for the border expedition
against the Apaches?

142
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:46,132
Yeah, that was back in,
back in '53.

143
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,267
I wouldn't have known you.

144
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,337
I mean, it's been so long.

145
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,705
Of course,
you wouldn't remember me.

146
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,574
I was just a shavetail, but...

147
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,243
that was my first assignment.

148
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,878
I guess
it would have been my last

149
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,615
if you hadn't led us out
of that Apache trap.

150
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,050
Charlie Trent.

151
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,315
You'll give me a chance then?

152
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,724
Now, Charlie,
that gold shipment is vital,

153
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,660
maybe with a war coming on.

154
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,652
We've got a scout.

155
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,035
Perhaps next time
I make a trip, Charlie.

156
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,815
Cap'n.

157
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,517
That old bum was pretty drunk,

158
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,645
thinking he can scout
for you, sir.

159
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,660
Corporal, "that old bum"

160
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,931
was the finest scout
in the United States Army.

161
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,635
Whatever I know about this
territory I learned from him.

162
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,538
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

163
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,530
I am, too.

164
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,072
Give us a bottle.

165
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,088
Give old buzzard bait
a drink here, too.

166
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,080
(Cutter laughs)

167
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,294
Wake up,
the man's buying you a drink.

168
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,286
Huh? Oh.

169
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,991
(men laughing)

170
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,989
- Charlie.
- Huh? Huh?

171
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,157
Oh, oh-ho!

172
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,025
Hoss, did I ever tell you
about the time

173
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,361
I led a expedition
up the Columbia River?

174
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you told me, Charlie.

175
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,267
Come on, let's go down to the
stable and you can clean it off.

176
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,703
I tried... Hoss.

177
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,439
Honest, honest, I tried hard.

178
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,542
You ask them soldier boys
if I didn't.

179
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:14,446
That captain--
he just didn't want me.

180
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,718
(sighs)

181
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,286
(clicks tongue)

182
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:24,189
Joe, give me a cup of coffee
and a sandwich.

183
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,769
Cutter's in here, Cap'n.

184
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,871
You ain't making no friends
with none of us, Cutter,

185
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:39,905
way you're treating the cap'n.

186
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,897
(Cutter scoffs)

187
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,014
I told you to be back and ready
in half an hour.

188
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,482
Mm-hmm.

189
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,085
Seems to me I do remember
you saying something like that.

190
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,120
Well, don't you mind now.

191
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,888
I'll be along a little while.

192
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,957
Barkeep...

193
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,859
set my friend the captain here
up a drink.

194
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:12,872
Last man that grabbed me
like that was a Blackfoot chief.

195
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,540
I cut his liver out.

196
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,376
A man don't live long
without a liver, Captain.

197
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,378
That's a pure medical fact.

198
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,214
I'm giving you a direct order.

199
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,885
Get outside
and join the detail-- now.

200
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,787
Or what?

201
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,722
Or you're through.

202
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:33,225
Well, now, that don't seem
so likely, mister.

203
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:36,395
You need a scout,
and I'm the only one there is.

204
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,832
You're a long way from being
indispensable, Cutter.

205
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,967
There's a man who knows
the wasteland country

206
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,903
better than you
or any scout alive--

207
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,205
Charlie Trent.

208
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,707
Trent?
(scoffs)

209
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,575
Where you gonna find him?

210
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,044
Charlie.

211
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,550
That's Charlie Trent?

212
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,920
(Cutter laughs)

213
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,856
The great Charlie Trent, huh?

214
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,491
Remington massacre.

215
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,959
You remember, Charlie?

216
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,895
You led them soldier boys
right into an ambush,

217
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,465
right smack-dab up to where
them Injuns was waitin'.

218
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,933
(Cutter laughing)

219
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,669
He's just the kind of a scout
you need, Cap'n.

220
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,937
(laughing)

221
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,532
Collect your gear from the wagon
and then clear out.

222
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,702
(snickers)

223
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:35,654
Take along plenty of water,
soldier boy, plenty of water.

224
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:39,113
(laughing)

225
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,724
Charlie...

226
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,235
Charlie, you asked me
for a chance.

227
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,509
This is it.

228
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,411
Now, don't give me
any cause to regret it.

229
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,116
We'll provide you with
your mount and your gear.

230
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,986
Get anything else you need.

231
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,887
We'll move out
as soon as you're ready.

232
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,127
Well?

233
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,138
Cap'n...

234
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,607
Cap'n, I...

235
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,236
He'll do it, Cap'n.

236
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,270
Uh, Charlie!

237
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,020
Cap'n...

238
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,321
my name's Cartwright.

239
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,056
I... I'm a friend
of old Charlie's.

240
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,890
I'll see to it he's
ready to go in no time.

241
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,726
We rode together.

242
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,468
Cap'n...

243
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,061
let him ride with you again.

244
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,043
I haven't much choice.

245
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,478
Thank you, sir.
I... I'll get him.

246
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,095
Charlie...

247
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,130
Charlie... I been looking
all over this town for you.

248
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,565
The cap'n's down there
waiting for you.

249
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,034
- You got to get your gear and...
- Leave me alone, please, sir.

250
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,502
Please leave me alone.

251
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,072
Just go... go tell
that captain man

252
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,407
you couldn't find me,
that's all.

253
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,076
Charlie... he's offering you

254
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,777
the chance you've
been waiting for.

255
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,980
If it was just me,
I-I wouldn't mind.

256
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,918
But, you see, it's Pender and
all his men depending on me...

257
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,053
Charlie...

258
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,290
you led the first map party
across that desert.

259
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,860
The first white man
that ever crossed it.

260
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,229
Now, if you can do that,

261
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,892
you can lead Pender
and his men now.

262
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,337
Or... Or was that just
one of your lies

263
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,106
about leading that map party?

264
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,776
No. 'Cause that was true,
Hoss, that was true.

265
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,144
All right, then.

266
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,680
Now, Charlie, you listen to me,
and you listen real good.

267
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,515
If you let Cap'n Pender
and those men

268
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,117
go out across that desert
without somebody

269
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,253
to scout the trail for 'em,
you <i>are</i> gonna be a coward

270
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,621
<i>and</i> a murderer.

271
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,858
Charlie, you got to do it!

272
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,227
If you...
if you would help me,

273
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,262
if you'll come with me.

274
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,498
Well, Charlie, I...

275
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,933
Just like... just like you...

276
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,467
just like you said yourself,

277
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,270
this here is the chance
I've been waiting for.

278
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,138
Will you please help me?
Will you please come with me?

279
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,277
Yes, sir, I'll go with you.

280
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,303
Ah. Thank you.

281
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,339
Oh, hey...

282
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,786
Well, good-bye, Captain,
and good luck.

283
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,487
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

284
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,390
Detail... forward!

285
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,258
Forward!

286
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,250
- Hyah!
- Ho!

287
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,961
(Cutter laughing)

288
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,371
CUTTER:
Hey, Charlie.

289
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,674
This time don't go letting
them injuns get <i>your</i> scalp.

290
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,940
(Cutter laughing)

291
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,784
(Cutter laughing)

292
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:26,986
You stand there laughing

293
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,988
like you just done
something great, Cutter.

294
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,991
But all you've done was
to mess up things real good.

295
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,827
It's working out
just the way I wanted, Buck.

296
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,328
And how do you make that?

297
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,797
We had a plan,
a plan to get the gold--

298
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,165
now we've got nothing.

299
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,235
I changed plans
for a better one.

300
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,337
We still get the gold.

301
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,829
Maybe you'd better tell us
what you got in mind.

302
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,410
Way it works out now,

303
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,646
I don't have to explain
me survivin'.

304
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,549
They get lost,
sand covers everything,

305
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,419
ain't a trace of nothin' left,

306
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,789
and everybody figures it's
old Charlie Trent led 'em wrong.

307
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,660
You were gonna lead them
soldiers out into the desert.

308
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,130
What if this Charlie
takes 'em another way?

309
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,999
Them renegade bands down south
would like nothing better

310
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,068
than to get their hands
on that gold.

311
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,837
Cheyenne on
the warpath up north.

312
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,808
They got nowhere to go
but across that desert...

313
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,039
with us following 'em.

314
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,522
- Detail...
- Detail...

315
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,990
- halt!
- halt!

316
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,333
- Forward!
- Forward!

317
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,962
- Ho!
- Yo!

318
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,709
Hyah!

319
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,701
Get out there!

320
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,671
- Detail...
- Detail...

321
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,663
- halt!
- halt!

322
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,802
- Dismount!
- Dismount!

323
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,904
Looking for something, Charlie?

324
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,082
Oh-ho...

325
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,418
Oh, no, no, I wasn't
looking for nothin'. I...

326
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,787
- Just-Just lookin'.
- A bottle?

327
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,490
What bottle? Heh.

328
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,225
(sighs)

329
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,716
You ain't gonna find it.

330
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,299
Hoss...

331
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,301
Hoss, that was all I had.

332
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,170
I... I didn't want to...

333
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,606
drink it, I just wanted
to know it was here, that's all.

334
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:38,065
I... I wasn't aimin'
to drink a drop of it.

335
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,581
I... I...

336
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,249
I promise.

337
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,411
Cross my heart.

338
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,787
I poured it out
this morning, Charlie.

339
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,196
I... I can't make it
without a drink, Hoss.

340
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,298
Hoss, I can't make it!

341
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:03,168
Charlie, you done made it almost
a week now, just on a pint.

342
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,037
Yeah, what we've
come through is nothing--

343
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,905
like taking a walk
down a boulevard

344
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,607
on a bright, sunshiny day.

345
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,776
You wait'll we get
across that there mountain

346
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,378
and hit the Great Salt Flats.

347
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,515
A man... a man's got to have
something in his insides

348
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,116
when he tackles that desert.

349
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:22,487
And you done took and poured my
insides right out on the ground.

350
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,889
Charlie...

351
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,325
you're just gonna have
to grow some new ones.

352
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,694
'Cause if you don't take us
across that desert,

353
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,754
we'll all gonna die
and rot out there.

354
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,234
All right, I'll...
I'll try, Hoss.

355
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,302
Honest, I'll-I'll try.

356
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,294
Here.

357
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,975
You drink your coffee
and... quit worryin'.

358
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,375
You're gonna make it.

359
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,146
(spits)

360
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,637
I...

361
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,855
CUTTER:
My!

362
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,657
There they be.

363
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,185
Getting ready to bed down
like nice soldier boys.

364
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,864
Come dark, we gonna ride.

365
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:09,096
From here on out,
we stay ahead of 'em.

366
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,081
What's our line of march?

367
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,350
Uh... due east, Cap'n.

368
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,452
You see, once you hit
that there desert,

369
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,288
there ain't no landmarks
to guide you.

370
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,224
You have to kind of...
kind of sense things, you know?

371
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,359
Kind of... kind of
feel your way along.

372
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,696
Charlie, Charlie, that's
what we're depending on you for,

373
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,299
to take us to
that first water hole

374
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,100
in a two-day march--
and then after that,

375
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,469
you'll have to lead us
to the next water hole,

376
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,506
then on to the last one.

377
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,873
Can you do all that, Charlie?

378
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,182
I tell you what...
(anxious laugh)

379
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,418
I been, I been,
I been thinking it over,

380
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,620
and I reckon it
might be our best bet

381
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,822
to head due north, you see,
and that way

382
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,191
we can circle the desert
entirely, you see?

383
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,493
With Yellow Star
and the whole Cheyenne Nation

384
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,795
on the warpath?

385
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,862
Look, I didn't bring you along

386
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,297
to tell me how
to get us all killed.

387
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,299
We have to cross that desert.

388
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,502
Now, you signed on as a scout
to lead us over it.

389
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,902
Now, can you do it?

390
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,737
Me and Hoss'll lead out.

391
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,611
Prepare to move.

392
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,386
Prepare to mount!

393
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,893
- Forward!
- Forward!

394
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,794
- Ho!
- Ho!

395
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,120
You aimin'
to take 'em on tonight?

396
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,388
Nah.

397
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,589
(Cutter chuckles)

398
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,657
You ever see the Zunis hunt fox?

399
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:13,792
No.

400
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,694
Well, they just let 'em
keep on runnin'

401
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,196
till their tongues are all
swole up and hanging out.

402
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,465
Then they walk up to 'em
real peaceful like

403
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,635
and club 'em to death.
(laughs)

404
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,904
Yes, sir, we're gonna
let those soldier boys

405
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,973
just ride on a piece.

406
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:31,705
Far enough so there
ain't no way back.

407
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:08,580
Sort of like being
out on the ocean, ain't it?

408
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,316
Only difference is that...

409
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:14,480
we're looking for water
instead of land.

410
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,290
You got your
bearing yet, Charlie?

411
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,293
(wind whistling softly)

412
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,696
You don't... you don't reckon
we could've circled back

413
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,998
on ourselves, do you,
and gotten lost?

414
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,034
No, no, no.

415
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,798
Of course not.

416
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,639
Ain't much daylight
left, Charlie,

417
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,609
and you said we'd sure find
that water hole before sundown.

418
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,878
That there water hole
has got to be

419
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,647
within an hour's march
of here, I'm tellin' you.

420
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,816
You go back
and tell the cap'n.

421
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,018
And capt'n will bring them
soldiers of his'n

422
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,020
up here right away.

423
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,489
You sure, Charlie?

424
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,791
Sure?
No, of course I ain't sure.

425
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,893
But I got to act like I was.

426
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,829
I got to fool them soldiers
into thinking I'm sure.

427
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,600
'Cause if just one man panics,
it'll spread like wildfire,

428
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,504
and we'll find ourselves
a bunch of buzzard bait.

429
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:09,341
You... You said you had faith
in me, didn't you?

430
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,176
(wind whistling)

431
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,577
Yes, sir, I do.

432
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,312
Well, hang on to it, son.

433
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:18,875
Hang on to it, 'cause that's
all I got to hang on to myself.

434
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,920
I'll tell 'em.

435
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,756
Ah. Now, when I find
that there water,

436
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,259
I'll fire three shots
in the air.

437
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,591
Yes, sir.

438
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,243
- Detail...
- Detail...

439
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,578
- halt!
- whoa!

440
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:47,712
HOSS:
Captain.

441
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,048
- Dismount.
- Dismount!

442
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,177
Captain... just
a little piece further.

443
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,792
I made a mistake trusting him.

444
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:04,262
I think it's time
we admit it... both of us,

445
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,631
we're lost, and you know it.

446
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,800
Cap'n, you're wrong.

447
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,570
With the captain's permission.

448
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,805
Me and the men
would like the captain

449
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,036
to tell us straight out
how we stand.

450
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,845
Cap'n.

451
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,515
Men, you've got a right to know.

452
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,917
(gunshot in distance)

453
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,053
- (second gunshot)
- It's Charlie.

454
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:31,323
- (third gunshot)
- He found water!

455
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,952
(whooping,
excited chatter, laughter)

456
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,662
Prepare to mount!

457
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,664
(whistling, excited chatter)

458
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,826
- Mount the horses!
- Yee-haw!

459
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,472
Hyah!

460
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,974
Forward!

461
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,142
- Hyah!
- Yo!

462
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,577
(excited shouts, whistling)

463
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,741
(whooping, excited shouts)

464
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,390
- CHARLIE: Cap'n! Ho! Ho!
- PENDER: Detail, halt!

465
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,691
CHARLIE:
Hold 'em back!

466
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,093
PENDER:
Master Sergeant, slow down!

467
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,095
(men clamoring)

468
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,097
CHARLIE:
Cap'n, hold your men back!

469
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,365
Keep your men back, Cap'n!

470
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,733
Don't let 'em come here!

471
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,602
- I knew you'd find it, boy!
- (indistinct chatter)

472
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,938
(two gunshots)

473
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,464
- Detail, ten-hut!
- Detail!

474
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,478
What's wrong?

475
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,811
That there water's
been poisoned.

476
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,719
See that animal over there?

477
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,858
Yeah, well, the same thing'll
happen to any of us

478
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,588
that drinks this here water.

479
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,164
We don't need a scout
to find poison water for us!

480
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,799
Sergeant.

481
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,833
Yes, sir?

482
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,170
Move the detail
to that area up ahead.

483
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,506
Make camp.

484
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:59,778
Issue half rations of water
to the men and the mules.

485
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,613
None to the mounts.

486
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,615
Detail...

487
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,049
forward.

488
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,289
All right, Charlie,
how far to the next water hole?

489
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,291
It's about a day's march.

490
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,795
But me nor nobody else
can say whether that water'll be

491
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,264
any more fittin'
to drink than this is.

492
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,165
Can you find it?

493
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,893
Found this one, didn't I?

494
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:36,414
What do you think, Cap'n?

495
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,782
We can make our water last
another full day.

496
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:44,456
We'll have to lose our mounts.

497
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:49,360
The mules can keep going
as long as they get some water.

498
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,628
(sighs)

499
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,231
You got to make
the decision, Cap'n.

500
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,533
Well, if we turn around
and go back,

501
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,536
the men and the gold
will be saved, but...

502
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:01,940
if we go on up ahead
and that water's poisoned, too,

503
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,171
it'll be too late to turn back.

504
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:11,516
There's nothing in my orders
about turning back.

505
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,185
Charlie, we'll move out
just before dawn,

506
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,177
- while it's still cool.
- Yeah.

507
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,741
(grunts)

508
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:51,422
(grunts)

509
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,158
You're gonna poison
this one, too?

510
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,893
That's what I'm gonna do, Buck.

511
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,761
They're liable
to get suspicious.

512
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,564
That don't make no difference.

513
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:03,568
Besides, they can't never
know just how it got done.

514
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,738
Now, go on, do like I told you,
start brushing out our tracks.

515
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,006
Look, all we've been doing

516
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,641
is riding around
this miserable desert.

517
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,310
Now, I say we stay here
and finish off them soldiers.

518
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,279
All I want is
to split that gold,

519
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,581
and I got nothin' so far
but sun-baked.

520
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,716
Latigo?

521
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,485
I'll side with them.

522
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,087
BUCK: Now, them soldiers
have got to come here.

523
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,056
All we got to do
is wait for 'em.

524
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:27,759
But if you feel you'd rather
not make the stand with us,

525
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,993
you can clear out.

526
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,461
No hard feelings.

527
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,930
(laughs)

528
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,195
No hard feelings, huh?

529
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,802
Now, you listen to me,

530
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,704
every last one of you.

531
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,207
There ain't one of you
got a chance

532
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:46,372
of leaving these salt flats
alive less'n I lead ya.

533
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,483
(chuckles)

534
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,286
Now, where would
you ambush eight men

535
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,322
on flatlands like this?

536
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,457
But up ahead, there's places
where we can pull it off.

537
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,827
Now, go on, do like I told you,
start brushing out our tracks.

538
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,160
(Cutter coughs loudly)

539
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,084
(wind whistling softly)

540
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,161
It's poisoned.

541
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,337
(grunts)

542
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,573
- Kelly! -Kelly! Get out!
That water's poison!

543
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,941
- Kelly...!
- Get out of there!

544
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,042
The water's poisoned!
The water's poisoned!

545
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:51,976
Get out of there!

546
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,478
Have you lost your head?

547
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,980
The water's good!
It's not poisoned!

548
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,216
- Let me have some more!
- Kelly! Kelly!

549
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,051
You just drunk your death, man!

550
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,719
KELLY:
That water's good!

551
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,721
The water's good!
It's not poisoned!

552
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,490
Stand back.

553
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,482
(Kelly panting)

554
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,129
Charlie...

555
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,897
make sure.

556
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,732
Test that water again.

557
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,567
No need to, Cap'n.

558
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,203
Kelly himself will prove
I was right.

559
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:20,605
You drunken old sot!

560
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,308
That belly is loaded with
so much poison now from liquor

561
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,776
you don't know
what you're doing!

562
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,611
You took us where there's water!

563
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,980
You don't... (panting)

564
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,576
(gasping, screaming)

565
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,477
(screaming)

566
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,060
(gasping)

567
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,128
Sergeant, bring a canteen.

568
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,797
Ain't no use doing that, Cap'n.

569
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,800
He can't swallow none nohow.

570
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,401
(weak gasping breaths)

571
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,393
(breathing stops)

572
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:00,543
Move him over under the wagon
and cover him with a blanket.

573
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,286
It's four riders
and one spare horse,

574
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,589
all headed away from here
and riding fast

575
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,191
for the next water hole.

576
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,626
And poison that one, too.

577
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,151
- (howling in distance)
- Yeah.

578
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,299
Another thing, Cap'n--

579
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,634
only a scout would know
his way around here

580
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,125
like them bushwhackers
are doing.

581
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,104
A scout--
that would have to be Cutter.

582
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,546
We'll go ahead while
we still have some water left

583
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,448
and try to fight
our way through.

584
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,017
Eh, Cap'n...

585
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,786
Cap'n, there's rocks
around that there water hole.

586
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,088
Best place in the world
for ambush.

587
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:47,025
They'd pick us off
before we ever seen 'em.

588
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,961
We're not gonna stay here
and die, not without a fight.

589
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,729
You got an idea
better than that?

590
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,064
Yeah. Yeah.

591
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:55,466
If they are still
at that water hole,

592
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:59,303
that water will be good
until after they finish us off.

593
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,672
That makes sense,
Charlie. Go on.

594
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,207
CHARLIE:
Yeah, but...

595
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,510
we got to make sure
they are still there.

596
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,079
So when the moon sets,
I'll start out, see?

597
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,882
I should make it in...
oh, an hour or two.

598
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,383
No, Charlie, no.

599
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,385
I'll go with some of my men.

600
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,522
Sergeant,
you and Johnson will go with me.

601
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,514
- Corporal...
- No, Cap'n.

602
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,062
(howling in distance)

603
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,697
I'm, uh, I'm a scout.

604
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:29,867
I can do a better job alone.

605
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,869
All right, Charlie.

606
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,005
But after you
get there, what then?

607
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:38,342
Well, if they ain't there
and the water is still good,

608
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,912
I'll fire three shots.

609
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,115
No... No, Cutter may have
heard that signal before.

610
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,184
So this time
I'll fire three shots,

611
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,753
wait a while,
then fire two more.

612
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,389
And, Cap'n, when
you hear them five shots,

613
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,024
you come a-runnin'.

614
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,460
And if I don't hear
the five shots?

615
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,096
If you don't hear 'em,
you head due north.

616
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,532
Forced march,
traveling by night.

617
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:04,068
And with any luck,
you ought to make the highlands

618
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,404
and water in about two days.

619
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:10,374
Course, the, uh...
Cheyennes might be there, too.

620
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,111
Buy then maybe...
maybe it's better to be scalped

621
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,412
than to die of thirst, huh?

622
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,402
(wry chuckle)

623
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,880
(howling in distance)

624
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,389
I'm sorry I ever
doubted you, Charlie.

625
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,158
Oh, ho-ho...

626
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,326
Oh...

627
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,094
thank you, Cap'n.

628
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,357
Thank ye.

629
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,940
Well, bye, Hoss.

630
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,543
Charlie, when I promised
to come along on this deal,

631
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:46,944
I meant all the way.

632
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,880
No, no, you've done
enough for me already.

633
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,449
I just ain't worth it,
can't you understand that?

634
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,185
If you leave me here, I'll...
I'll just tag along after you.

635
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,987
Hoss, you ain't
a-comin' with me.

636
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,589
'Sides, I...
I travel faster alone.

637
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,225
Charlie...

638
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,693
if I let
you go out there alone,

639
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,295
I'd feel guilty
the rest of my life.

640
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,830
That's better than
being dead, ain't it?

641
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,799
You know better than that.

642
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,660
Yeah.

643
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,870
Five shots, right, Cap'n?

644
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,481
(wind whistling softly)

645
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,298
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

646
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,667
- There sure ain't
no sign of 'em. -Yeah.

647
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,001
That don't mean those fellas

648
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,137
ain't up there hidin'
in them there rocks.

649
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,471
- Well...
- I don't like it.

650
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,874
It just...
it just don't feel good.

651
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,844
We're gonna have to take
a chance on it anyhow.

652
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,714
Let's go.

653
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,206
All right,
but you be careful, son.

654
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,938
Dad-burnit, Charlie,
is it gonna take you all day

655
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,930
to make up your mind?

656
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,677
Ha! Whoo!

657
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,203
(whooping, shouting)

658
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,576
(both shouting happily)

659
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,923
- CHARLIE: Water!
- HOSS: Hola!

660
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,524
(Hoss whoops)

661
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:42,059
- (Hoss whoops)
- CHARLIE: Oh, boy!

662
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,060
Oh!

663
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,464
(Hoss whoops)

664
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,300
Now, ain't them
a happy pair of fools?

665
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,201
(Cutter laughs)

666
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,039
(laughing)

667
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,375
Drink your fill, boys.

668
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,243
Then we're going to have
a nice, long talk

669
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:00,905
about my good friend
Cap'n Pender.

670
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,964
(blow thuds, Hoss groans)

671
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,033
Why didn't them soldier boys
come with you?

672
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,701
How many of them are there left?

673
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,136
I reckon that's something
you're going to have

674
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,604
to find out, mister.

675
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,105
Well, that's something
I'm just going to find out.

676
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,074
Cutter!

677
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,410
(groans)

678
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,012
They're back
at the other water hole.

679
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,013
- Charlie!
- There's...

680
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,815
There's five of 'em.

681
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,651
One of 'em died.

682
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,787
They're waiting for my signal
to come on ahead.

683
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,119
Charlie!

684
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,826
Cap'n Pender got
any suspicion of me?

685
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,861
No, course not.

686
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:51,862
(chuckles)

687
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,798
No, if, if we had
any suspicions,

688
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,701
you don't suppose that me
and Hoss would have come walking

689
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,536
in here the way we done, do you?

690
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:02,440
No, I reckon not,
being the scout you once was.

691
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,635
What's that signal?

692
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,311
I ain't a-gonna tell you.

693
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,814
You ain't a-gonna tell me?

694
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,450
(laughs)

695
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,444
Hey, Latigo,
fetch me my saddlebag.

696
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:23,217
You ain't a-gonna tell me.

697
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,267
Charlie, this ought
to make you talk, huh?

698
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,604
(Cutter laughing)

699
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,606
It's all yours, Charlie,

700
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,508
you just tell me
what that signal is.

701
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,944
(Cutter laughing)

702
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:43,314
My, I bet you got mighty dry
for this, too.

703
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,249
(inhales)
Mmm!

704
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,851
Smell it, Charlie, huh?

705
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,387
- (Charlie sniffs)
- What's the signal now, huh?

706
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,421
Don't you tell him, Charlie.

707
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,590
(Cutter laughs)

708
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,326
Mmm!

709
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,129
That's too good
to waste on you, but...

710
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,531
(men chuckling)

711
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,733
(Charlie gasps)

712
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,901
Tastes good, huh?

713
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,202
Yeah.

714
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,771
What's the signal, Charlie?

715
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,106
And it's all yours,
every last bit of it.

716
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,441
Signal?

717
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:14,278
Three sh... three sh...

718
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,746
- Louder, Charlie, louder.
- Three sh...

719
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,047
Three shots.

720
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,049
Charlie! Charlie!

721
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,118
Three shots.

722
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:24,688
The signal is three shots,

723
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:28,092
and when,
when Pender hears them,

724
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,128
they'll move out
and join us here.

725
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:34,565
CUTTER:
Three shots, just like before.

726
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,867
Well, I wanted to make sure.

727
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,303
Eh, just like before, huh?

728
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,338
Yeah, that's right.

729
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:42,640
(laughs)

730
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,074
Hey, Buck, untie him.

731
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,917
What about him?

732
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,919
Ah, untie him.

733
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,820
He ain't going no place.

734
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,658
(Charlie mutters raspily)

735
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,393
- Yeah, now...
- (Cutter laughing)

736
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,495
Now give it to me.

737
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,496
Give it to me.

738
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,231
Here's your reward, Charlie.

739
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,733
(Cutter laughing)

740
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:12,470
Is it, is it all right, Hoss?

741
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,207
Yeah, I... I reckon you earned
that one, Charlie.

742
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,675
(Charlie chuckles)

743
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:21,111
This ought to bring 'em running
like a flock of dumb sheep.

744
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:25,115
(three gunshots)

745
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:27,107
Three.

746
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,355
Go on, Charlie.

747
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:34,348
Just fire two more times.

748
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,431
Five shots, he said.

749
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,132
He's trying to warn us.

750
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,124
They run into trouble.

751
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,251
(Charlie chuckles)

752
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:03,988
We... We sure fooled 'em
that time, didn't we, huh?

753
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,589
(mutters)

754
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:09,193
Cutter thought he was tormenting
me into telling the truth.

755
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,427
(chuckles)

756
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,963
And all the time it was
Cutter himself that gives

757
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:17,134
the signal for Pender
to start moving north.

758
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:19,169
Yep, but...

759
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:22,106
they're gonna
find out in a minute.

760
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:25,676
When they do, they're liable
to be real mean, Charlie.

761
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,907
Yeah, well, I, I...

762
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:34,418
You know... you know,
it's a funny thing.

763
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,853
I got plenty
of this doggone stuff.

764
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,288
I don't seem to want it.

765
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,622
(chuckles)

766
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:43,160
You know, it kind of, uh,
kind of burns my insides.

767
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,152
LATIGO:
Hey, Cutter.

768
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,225
- Cutter.
- Look, here they come.

769
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,775
Three soldier boys.

770
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,368
Only three.

771
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,505
Ain't none of 'em Pender.

772
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,984
He's a smart one.

773
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,786
Maybe he figures
on going behind this butte

774
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,788
and having himself a look-see.

775
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,856
Hey, Latigo, you get up
on one of them rocks,

776
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,158
keep your eyes peeled.

777
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,826
You let me know,
but don't you do no shootin'.

778
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,692
You hear?

779
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,435
I... I guess the only reason
I drink the doggone stuff

780
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,604
is so that I can stop
remembering.

781
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,440
I just don't understand it.

782
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,642
That wasn't the signal
for them to come up here.

783
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:34,812
You see, Hoss, years ago,

784
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:37,948
I led a whole detachment
of cavalry

785
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,451
into a Kiowa trap.

786
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,988
They was all butchered
and they died cursing me.

787
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:47,591
Wasn't your fault, Charlie.

788
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:48,892
Yeah?

789
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:51,595
That ain't good enough.

790
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:55,866
Buck, you keep watching
that wagon.

791
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,534
(blows)

792
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,337
Morgan, you take those two
and you keep 'em out of sight.

793
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:03,671
I may need the old man later,
to wave these on.

794
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,543
You two get over
behind those rocks,

795
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,412
and don't try
to let 'em know we're here

796
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:10,814
or I'll break this gun barrel
right over your heads.

797
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,806
Stay low!

798
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:16,587
In no time at all now,

799
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:19,250
we gonna be divvyin' up
that gold.

800
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,328
He must have spotted the others.

801
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,663
Now, you stay here, Buck.

802
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,164
No shooting till I start it,

803
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,234
and you be mighty careful
how you go hitting them mules.

804
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,302
Two of 'em, coming from high up
and behind us.

805
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,837
One of 'em's the captain.

806
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,439
Well, that makes it
easier for us.

807
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,908
We'll just let 'em sneak up
on us before we start shooting

808
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,543
Come on.

809
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,478
We gotta do something, Hoss.
We gotta...

810
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,913
Shut up!

811
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,517
Old man, don't be so hoggy
with that whiskey.

812
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,362
Fill that cup.

813
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,354
Sure.

814
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,903
Bring it over here.

815
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,895
Careful.

816
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:16,240
(grunting)

817
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:22,820
Good work, Charlie.

818
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,521
You go get Buck,
I'm going after Cutter.

819
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:25,511
Right.

820
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:35,255
Well, if they're down there,
they're not giving it away.

821
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,504
Let's go down to those
four big rocks down there.

822
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,106
- See 'em?
- Yeah.

823
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,098
I'll go first.

824
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,894
Doggone it,
I had him dead to rights.

825
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,329
We got him pinned down now.

826
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,992
We can blast him
out of there easy.

827
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,433
(gunfire)

828
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,723
(grunts)

829
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:36,421
(gunfire continues in distance)

830
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,936
(grunts)

831
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,928
(gunfire continues in distance)

832
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,818
Cutter!

833
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:16,066
(gunfire continuing)

834
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,056
(gunfire stops)

835
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:33,917
Hey, the wa--the water is good,
Cap'n; you can drink it.

836
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:36,186
Ah, it's just a crease, Charlie.

837
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,555
Hey, Corporal!

838
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:39,890
Corporal!

839
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,759
Bring up the wagon!

840
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,028
Get yourselves a drink!

841
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,463
Yee-ha!

842
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,796
Ha-hoo!

843
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:52,169
Hyah!

844
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,467
("Taps" playing)

845
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:09,085
Detail, atten-hut!

846
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:22,165
Scout... lead us out.

847
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,600
Sure, Cap'n.

848
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,538
- Detail!
- Detail!

849
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,540
- Forward!
- Forward!

850
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,532
Ho!

851
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,517
ANNOUNCER: <i>This has been</i>
