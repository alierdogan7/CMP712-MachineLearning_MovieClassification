1
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:52,483
Junction City!

2
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:39,290
Stay.

3
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:43,453
Excuse me.

4
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:56,668
Marshall, it's the Younger gang!
I just saw them, bold as brass!

5
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:59,972
- Take it steady, Frank.
- Cole and Bob Younger. No mistake.

6
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:03,412
- Where are they?
- The bank. Four men, right now.

7
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:05,472
The Younger brothers.

8
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,314
Looks like we caught us
a real big fish.

9
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:09,853
All right, boys.

10
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:12,788
Spread the word.
Everyone knows what to do.

11
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:15,486
Just tell them to hold it
till I give the signal.

12
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,960
All right, gentlemen.
Hold steady.

13
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:21,658
Now we can do this the easy way--
nobody has to die--

14
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:24,429
or we could do it the hard way.

15
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:26,265
The choice is yours.

16
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:30,365
You, open the safe.

17
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:33,206
I don't know the combination.

18
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:05,064
I hit him.
I shot Lightning Jack Kane.

19
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:07,604
I got him, Clem.
I seen him buck just as I fired.

20
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:21,551
I just shot Kane,
the fastest gun alive.

21
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:23,746
Maybe you hit him too,
but mine was a head shot.

22
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:25,949
Knocked him forward,
right out of the saddle.

23
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:28,857
There ain't no maybes.
My shot was plumb in the middle.

24
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:31,828
It's the Younger brothers.
We got the Younger brothers!

25
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,962
- We got one too!
- I got one.

26
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:37,228
Set the camera up here.

27
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:39,293
Let's get that dead body
in the front.

28
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:41,305
I want the committee
right behind it.

29
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:44,342
And get the town hall in the back.
This is history.

30
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:46,343
That there is Sam Jorgenson.

31
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:49,005
Where's the other one?
Where's that Lightning Jack?

32
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,914
We got Kane, Marshall. Me and Pat here,
we filled him full of holes.

33
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:55,817
Horse took a fright
and dragged the body, I reckon.

34
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:58,822
He ain't the fastest gun alive--
not anymore.

35
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,923
- You better go fetch the body.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:06,225
Marshall Kurtz in the center. You've
gotta be in the center of the photo.

37
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:08,831
Can we have a statement?

38
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,267
I'm not much for speeches.
I leave that to the politicians.

39
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:15,670
I am just a man
who's doing the job...

40
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,674
that people elected me to do.

41
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:22,770
I think today we sent out a message
to all lawbreakers.

42
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:24,781
In Junction City...

43
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:26,942
you will respect the law...

44
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:28,952
or you will learn to fear it!

45
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,510
- Hear! Hear!
- Right!

46
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:33,489
I guess these boys
are just slow learners.

47
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:37,623
Three cheers for Marshall Kurtz.
Hip, hip, hooray!

48
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,134
All right. Hold it.

49
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,707
- Read that out to me.
- Yes, sir.

50
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:26,903
But you don't need the gun, sir.
I ain't the law.

51
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:30,981
Read it.

52
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:33,540
''Younger gang wiped out.''

53
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:38,311
That part.

54
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:41,620
''The only flaw in the trap
was the escape...

55
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:44,127
of Lightning Jack Kane...

56
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:49,324
although several witnesses swore...

57
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,334
he was shot full of holes...

58
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:53,802
and riding dead in the saddle.

59
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,973
Kane is of medium height
and build, blond hair...

60
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:05,942
with a mean, weathered face...

61
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:09,509
and has an English accent.''

62
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:11,680
- English?
- Yes, sir.

63
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:15,055
I don't speak English.
I'm a bloody Australian!

64
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:19,091
How can I send this
to my mates back home...

65
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:21,997
and tell them what a big success I am
if it says I'm English?

66
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:26,267
- Bloody newspapers. Never get it right.
- That's right.

67
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:29,829
''Marshall Dan Kurtz
was unconcerned...

68
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:32,035
saying, 'Dead or alive...

69
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,544
Kane don't matter.

70
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:36,546
We got Cole Younger.

71
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:40,380
He was the leader and brains
of the gang.

72
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:43,079
Kane was a follower...

73
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:45,714
and just a brainless no-account.

74
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,089
Without the Younger brothers,
he's nothing.'''

75
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:54,331
He's nothin'?

76
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,501
Without the Younger brothers,
I'm nothin'?

77
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:58,558
Right.

78
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,570
Brainless no-account?

79
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:01,935
That's what it said.

80
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:07,877
We'll see who's brainless.

81
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:13,417
What's all that shooting
down there?

82
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:17,287
What's going on?

83
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:26,860
<i>That's four bags of soap...</i>

84
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:28,865
<i>and two sacks of flour.</i>

85
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:33,734
You got that, boy?
That's four bags of salt...

86
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:35,773
two bags of flour.

87
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,774
That's on top...

88
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:39,776
of my regular order.

89
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:04,195
His handwriting is so messed up,
Mr. Curran. Maybe I can make it out.

90
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:06,464
It says, ''Thank you, sir.
Is that everything?''

91
00:10:06,537 --> 00:10:08,903
That's what I thought it said,
but it's bad written, real bad.

92
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:12,074
Get him to load the rest
on the wagon out there...

93
00:10:12,143 --> 00:10:14,111
and you better do
the tallying up yourself.

94
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,305
Being he can't write proper...

95
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,542
we don't want him
doing no figuring, do we?

96
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,111
Put the rest of those goods
on Mr. Curran's wagon.

97
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:27,054
And no more sass, you hear?

98
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,652
Pay him no heed, Mr. Doyle. It's a fine
Christian thing you've done...

99
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:33,720
taking on this poor, unfortunate boy.

100
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:36,028
It's been a real struggle,
Mrs. Franks.

101
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,034
The boy was poorly raised.

102
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:41,094
His folks filled his head
with all kind of fool thoughts...

103
00:10:41,172 --> 00:10:43,163
that he was just as good
as a normal man.

104
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:45,334
Of course when they died
of the cholera...

105
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,107
I knew it was my Christian duty
to take him in--

106
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,444
try to get his mind right.

107
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:53,575
Bless you.
Good day, Mr. Doyle.

108
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:56,088
Good day to you.
It's real hot out there today.

109
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:58,253
Oh, it sure is.

110
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,759
Ben.

111
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,524
Judge Curran
is one of my best customers.

112
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:10,090
I ain't gonna have you sassin' him.

113
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:19,003
That's it! No more notes
and no more writing.

114
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:20,339
You understand?

115
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:22,846
Half the folks around here
can't read or write.

116
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:25,144
And it irks them
that somebody like you can.

117
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:27,348
It's unnatural.

118
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:32,015
I took you on when nobody else would.
I deserve some gratitude.

119
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:41,257
Finish loading
and tally up the cash drawer...

120
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,358
and take it to the bank.

121
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,505
Now hold steady, gentlemen.

122
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:55,569
We can do this the easy way--
no one has to die--

123
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:58,582
or we can do it the hard way,
but the choice is yours.

124
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,250
Fill it up.

125
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,230
Shut the door. Against the wall.

126
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:14,993
Hands in the air.
Keep clear of that window.

127
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:19,403
Fill it up.

128
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:21,638
Yeah.

129
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:23,640
Against the wall.

130
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:29,037
Keep away from the window.
What the hell's this?

131
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:31,742
- Storekeepers. We're closing up.
- What?

132
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:35,684
Stores-- they close at 4:00.
They do their bankin' from 4:00 to 5:00.

133
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:39,115
Maybe you ought to come back
after 5:00.

134
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,757
You.

135
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,460
You.

136
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:52,696
Yeah. Open the safe.

137
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:00,205
I said open the safe.

138
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,770
I can't. I'm just a teller.
Only the manager knows the combination.

139
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,881
Where's the manager?

140
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:12,583
Shit.

141
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:13,715
Over there.

142
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,589
Away from the window.

143
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:23,600
Hey, they're robbing the bank!
Quick, call the sheriff!

144
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:25,863
Hands down! Give me that.

145
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,785
Better hope you got
a lot of friends out there.

146
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:53,854
- Hold still, boys. He's got a hostage.
- It's only the dummy.

147
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:58,031
Hold still, everyone.

148
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,501
Mate, come on.

149
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,074
Trail 'em,Jed,
but stay well back.

150
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,584
We need a few good riflemen
with fresh horses.

151
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,451
Find me someone that can read tracks.
We'll meet at the livery stable.

152
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,625
Go.

153
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:44,047
One word and you're dead.

154
00:14:56,961 --> 00:15:00,362
- Where did they go,Jed?
- Through that pass.

155
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,763
Do we circle?

156
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,358
No, follow me!

157
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:09,706
Mount up.

158
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:20,111
When I say jump, you jump.
No questions, no back talk.

159
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:22,485
Mount up.

160
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,137
What are you,
part Indian or something?

161
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,334
No, an Indian
would have been smart enough...

162
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:46,843
to let me ride right into them.

163
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,987
- Tracks gotta be here somewhere.
- Take the men and circle the ridge.

164
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:06,496
- We'll head for the county line.
- Let's go, boys.

165
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:17,907
Get down.

166
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:22,703
You did good.

167
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,841
Kept your mouth shut.
I'm letting you go.

168
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:28,785
You can talk now.

169
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:34,086
You can't talk?

170
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:46,099
Turn around.

171
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,366
Face that tree.

172
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,204
Turn back, you're a dead man.

173
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,642
Don't even think about it.

174
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:04,218
''I'll join your gang.''

175
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,359
What gang?

176
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,991
What are you gonna do anyway,
walk into a bank and write 'em a note?

177
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:21,301
Dumbest thing I ever heard of.
Take your boots off.

178
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:27,370
Quick. I don't want you
running back over there...

179
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:29,470
to tell the posse where we are.

180
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,685
Just be glad...

181
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:42,282
that you're walking back to town...

182
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,851
instead of lying
across the saddle.

183
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:22,799
Hold up, boys.

184
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:25,963
It don't make no sense.

185
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:29,871
He's turned the horse loose
and kept the boy.

186
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:34,275
Maybe he's just running that poor
dummy boy barefoot out of pure meanness.

187
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:38,481
Stay alert, men.
And shoot on sight.

188
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:07,569
Shit, how did you get--

189
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:31,959
I'm snakebit.

190
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:37,266
I can't be snakebit.
That's a Navajo snake charm.

191
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:39,502
Cost me $50.

192
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:48,715
Yeah.

193
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:50,720
Suck the poison.

194
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:03,666
You're gonna have to suck
the poison out.

195
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,668
I can't reach it.

196
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:23,720
What? Put the gun down?

197
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,896
That's it?
Is it just a splinter?

198
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:41,233
No bite.

199
00:20:42,006 --> 00:20:44,167
See? Snake charm works.

200
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,378
I ain't scared of snakes, okay?

201
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:53,576
I just don't like 'em.

202
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:02,425
Nonetheless...

203
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:07,052
you was willing to chaw on my butt
to save my hide.

204
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:10,667
Fact is...

205
00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:12,930
you've been saving my hide
since we met.

206
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:16,371
I ain't a man
to take that lightly.

207
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,873
Let's git.

208
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:30,820
They'd have turned back by now.

209
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:33,721
A posse will never cross
the county line.

210
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,725
We've got some talking to do.

211
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:00,609
I thought you'd given up tobacco.

212
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:02,778
All right.Just this once.

213
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:14,497
How come you can't talk?

214
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,244
Baby. You had a baby.

215
00:22:32,116 --> 00:22:35,745
You're the baby.
Baby can't talk.

216
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,754
You was born dumb...

217
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:39,756
but not deaf.

218
00:22:39,824 --> 00:22:42,156
Not deaf.

219
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:45,320
What's your name?
What do people call you?

220
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:10,351
Ben Doyle. Ben Doyle...

221
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:13,083
meet Lightning Jack Kane.

222
00:23:16,994 --> 00:23:20,589
That's the Lightning Jack Kane.

223
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:26,996
You probably heard of me.

224
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,223
Outlaw.

225
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:40,576
You want to be an outlaw?

226
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:42,578
Doesn't everybody?

227
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:49,519
Gonna help me rob a bank.

228
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,182
Yeah, I could have used
some backup last time, but--

229
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:08,431
Your ears, your eyes for me.

230
00:25:10,574 --> 00:25:12,166
You think I need them?

231
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,248
What makes you think
I need your eyes?

232
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:26,854
Just what gave you that notion?

233
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:39,933
Yeah, well, my eyes get
a little fuzzy up close...

234
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:43,269
trying to read
and squinting down a sight...

235
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,706
but I can hit anything
you can point at...

236
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:48,904
and it'll be dead
before your finger's straight.

237
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,343
See that? That's an evil eye.
Got it off a Navajo medicine man.

238
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,650
$ 7 5.

239
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,316
That's my aiming eye.

240
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:02,985
So don't starting thinking
just 'cause one part of me...

241
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,495
ain't working good
that I got a weakness.

242
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,801
Yeah.

243
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,896
I guess you know better than me
how folks react to weakness.

244
00:26:20,678 --> 00:26:24,546
Anyway, you still think
I need help?

245
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:50,834
''I can tell a one-dollar bill
from a hundred-dollar bill.

246
00:26:56,647 --> 00:26:57,909
They're all ones!

247
00:26:58,816 --> 00:27:02,411
I knocked off a bank
for 50 bucks.

248
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,293
What?

249
00:27:21,005 --> 00:27:23,235
''I'll never tell anyone.''

250
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,512
Oh, you'll never tell anyone.
Of course.

251
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:36,786
Hey, while you're at it...

252
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:40,756
don't go talking to no one
about that snakebite either, eh?

253
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,419
Don't go talkin' to no one, eh?

254
00:27:44,228 --> 00:27:46,162
I just come out with 'em.

255
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,664
Don't go talking to no one.
Don't tell anyone.

256
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,769
I'll probably make up a lot more
funny jokes like that about you.

257
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,537
But if you ride with me,
nobody else will.

258
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:13,289
Have you ever tried
Arizona chicken?

259
00:28:19,997 --> 00:28:21,794
Australia is a colony.

260
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,358
So if you rob a bank back there,
you're wanted all over the country.

261
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:29,668
But in America, you can rob banks
in five different states.

262
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,675
You still got another 30.
Across the border and you run free.

263
00:28:32,743 --> 00:28:37,908
No worries. Yeah,
democracy is a wonderful thing.

264
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:45,112
What?

265
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:49,626
Ah, gut pain.
Well, pick your outhouse.

266
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:52,322
And next time you eat buzzard,
only the drumsticks.

267
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:03,699
We ain't got all day.
Go anywhere.

268
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,538
Must have been a powerful,
bad smeller.

269
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,982
What do you smell, old Mate?

270
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:01,257
Not you. Him. He's Mate.

271
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,266
That's his name.

272
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,894
I was going to call him Thunder
at one stage.

273
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,996
You know,
Lightning Jack and Thunder.

274
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,439
He wouldn't hear of it.

275
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,910
Aha. That's what he smelt.

276
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:28,924
No, they're just plain folks.

277
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,757
I never shoot plain folks...

278
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,262
unless they annoy me.

279
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,367
Mount up.

280
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,307
Sling it.

281
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:49,235
Act like your mind's gone away.

282
00:30:49,313 --> 00:30:52,305
Smile. I don't need a gun.

283
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,181
I'm gonna charm these folks
out of a $ 10 horse.

284
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:57,311
Five dollars, maybe less.

285
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,322
I got a silver tongue.

286
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,359
Howdy, neighbors.

287
00:31:02,426 --> 00:31:05,361
$30 for this bag of bones!

288
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:08,193
Thieving bastard.
I should have shot him.

289
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:35,181
Now relax.
Like I said, democracy.

290
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:38,194
We're not wanted in this state
till after we rob the bank.

291
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,401
All right. I go in...

292
00:31:50,474 --> 00:31:52,840
I go to the far wall...

293
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,845
wave the money,
then you come in.

294
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:59,474
I do the speech.
All you gotta do is draw your gun...

295
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,484
and cover me.

296
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,417
Oh, unless someone goes
for their gun.

297
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,424
Then you shoot them.

298
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,234
Now, hold steady, gentlemen. Ma'am.

299
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,704
We can do this the easy way--

300
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:30,713
no one has to die--

301
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:33,841
or we can do it the hard way.

302
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,476
The choice is yours.

303
00:33:07,384 --> 00:33:10,353
There's someone robbing the bank!
Get the sheriff, quick!

304
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,441
Bank robbery bungled.

305
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,154
''In a display of criminal stupidity...

306
00:33:45,222 --> 00:33:48,453
one of the two would-be robbers
managed to shoot himself...

307
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,586
before the tellers
could even raise their hands.

308
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,831
His partner panicked...

309
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:02,532
and the two fled in fear as
the bank staff laughed in their faces.

310
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:07,567
One witness thought one of the men
was Jack Kane.''Jack Kane?

311
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,579
What happened to Lightning Jack?

312
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:12,715
I sweat blood earning that handle...

313
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:16,412
and some pissant reporter
just leaves it out.

314
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,216
I'm writing him a letter.

315
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,749
''But U.S. Marshal Daniel Kurtz
dismissed this claim...

316
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:27,321
saying, 'Every time there's a robbery,
someone identifies Kane.

317
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,664
But that colorful outlaw era
is finished.

318
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,899
Kane is just a loose end
who will be cut off.

319
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:38,100
He sure ain't no Jesse James.'''

320
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,637
What do they mean,
I ain't no Jesse James?

321
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,507
What's so special about Jesse James?

322
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,517
He sure didn't impress me none.

323
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,466
Do I know Jesse James? Yeah.

324
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:08,266
Rode on a few banks a couple of years
back with him and his brother Frank.

325
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,797
Frank's the brains.
Jesse is a pecker-head.

326
00:35:15,212 --> 00:35:17,680
Pecker. Down there.
That's your pecker.

327
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,682
Jesse's a pecker-head.

328
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,253
Is he bald?

329
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:34,723
No, he's not bald.
Just dumb.

330
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,826
Dumb like I was to try and rob a bank
with a greenhorn like you.

331
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,280
We've got to face the facts.

332
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:55,452
I was born to be an outlaw.
You wasn't.

333
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:01,081
Go home, kid. Forget it.

334
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:03,285
Just one good headline.

335
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,796
Is that too much to ask?

336
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,663
You want bullets?

337
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,776
What do you want them for?

338
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,472
Gonna rob a bank?

339
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:24,013
By yourself?

340
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:30,152
Oh, you're gonna join up
with the James boys.

341
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:33,088
They're gonna learn you
to be an outlaw?

342
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:36,217
So one day I'll pick up the newspaper,
and it'll say...

343
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:39,456
''Jesse James and Ben Doyle rob bank.''

344
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,325
Like they could teach you things
that I couldn't.

345
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,569
I suppose they'll put that
in the paper too.

346
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:51,732
''Jesse James succeeds
where Jack Kane failed.''

347
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,074
Nah.

348
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,067
I was just joshing you.
Come on.

349
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,540
Those James boys couldn't even teach you
to fart like an outlaw.

350
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,409
Yeah. There'll be more of them.

351
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,576
If they come down for a visit,
just do like I do.

352
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,586
I've spent some friendly time
with the Navajo.

353
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,721
There'll be no trouble
if we follow their rules.

354
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,725
Just passing through.

355
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,969
Show no fear. No disrespect.

356
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,772
But most important--

357
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:07,843
Shit.

358
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,210
No rules. They're Comanche.

359
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,477
Just mount up steady-like.

360
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,895
They ain't gone.

361
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,527
Comanche don't even have a word
for retreat.

362
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,537
They'll be circling right now.

363
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,366
That means the other three
will come from my side.

364
00:40:17,714 --> 00:40:19,773
Don't shoot, no matter what.

365
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:23,018
Just follow me.

366
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:46,735
Get down! Ride low!

367
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:30,919
Try and stay on your horse.
I can't take on the whole bloody tribe.

368
00:42:58,441 --> 00:43:01,535
Why didn't we shoot them?
They're Comanche.

369
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:03,738
We don't know their names.

370
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:05,747
You don't know nothing
about Indians, do you?

371
00:43:07,149 --> 00:43:09,743
If you kill a Comanche
and you don't know his name...

372
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:11,810
his spirit goes into an owl...

373
00:43:11,888 --> 00:43:16,552
and every night that owl will
come around calling out, ''Who? Who?''

374
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:20,187
If you can't sing out the right name,
it'll follow you forever.

375
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:22,925
Bad medicine.

376
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:26,935
Eh? I learnt that secret
from old Red Eagle himself.

377
00:43:27,003 --> 00:43:29,267
He was a Comanche.

378
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:33,172
Sold me this charm.
It keeps grizzly bears away.

379
00:43:33,242 --> 00:43:35,176
Only $30.

380
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,111
I think we got a problem, Dan.

381
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:46,678
Granville? That's ten days' hard ride
from where he was hiding two days ago.

382
00:43:46,756 --> 00:43:49,782
- This is horse shit.
- No, it's called competition.

383
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:52,623
That stuff we ran on law and order
and the Younger gang wipeout...

384
00:43:52,695 --> 00:43:54,856
got picked up nationwide.

385
00:43:54,931 --> 00:43:57,092
<i>Heck, the Mail made you
a national hero, Dan.</i>

386
00:43:57,967 --> 00:44:00,265
So our rivals are rooting
for the underdog.

387
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:06,174
They'll try and turn Kane
into some kind of folk hero outlaw.

388
00:44:06,242 --> 00:44:08,733
Then you'll be just the lawman
who failed to catch him.

389
00:44:09,912 --> 00:44:14,076
So far it's just this one small paper,
but it could catch on.

390
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,313
Then we'll have to deflate
Mr. Kane pronto.

391
00:44:18,087 --> 00:44:19,019
How?

392
00:44:19,088 --> 00:44:22,114
I can find the right people
with the proper incentive.

393
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:25,957
What I need is some financial support
from the law and order association.

394
00:44:26,028 --> 00:44:28,519
Well, I'm sure
that can be arranged.

395
00:44:28,598 --> 00:44:32,261
<i>Junction City and the Mail
are behind you 100%.</i>

396
00:44:33,669 --> 00:44:34,795
Governor.

397
00:44:41,177 --> 00:44:42,804
I'm safe.

398
00:44:42,878 --> 00:44:44,470
There's no law in Wayside Flats.

399
00:44:46,048 --> 00:44:48,380
I got us a cabin
a couple of miles up the road.

400
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:51,443
Tomorrow I'll start teaching you
the outlaw trade.

401
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,546
But now there's something
more important--

402
00:44:54,624 --> 00:44:56,057
the Red Garter Saloon.

403
00:45:05,635 --> 00:45:08,365
There's only one reason
this town exists.

404
00:45:08,437 --> 00:45:11,895
Tell me, how long has it been
since you bedded down a woman?

405
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:17,145
Don't know?

406
00:45:21,651 --> 00:45:23,209
You never?

407
00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:25,219
You never?

408
00:45:29,558 --> 00:45:32,288
You're a full-grown man.

409
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:34,295
We're outlaws.

410
00:45:46,742 --> 00:45:49,438
Figured on learning you
how to rob banks.

411
00:45:50,513 --> 00:45:52,879
Never figured on learning you
at lovemaking.
