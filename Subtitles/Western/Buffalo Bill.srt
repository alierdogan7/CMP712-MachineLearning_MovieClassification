- I guess I'd better go catch them mules.

- My daughter and I are grateful, sir.

- Anyone would figure himself lucky for the chance.

She's right, Mr. Cody.

We need more men like you

There's some white men
that need wiping out.

40

I don't understand you, sir.

41

This is not a war arrow.
It's a hunting arrow. There are no barbs.

<i>A hunting arrow?</i>
<i>How very considerate of them.</i>

Are you implying
that we were fair game?

44
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:41,304
No, I mean that those were agency Indians,
drunk on white man's whiskey.

I suppose that
excuses them out here.

00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:47,985
I didn't come here to steal.

00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:51,545
Maybe you Indians have another word for it,
but that's my dress you have on.

124

I tell you,
I didn't come here to steal.

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,269
- Senator, have I made myself clear?
- Perfectly.

140
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:24,032
You may count on my support
when the issue comes before Congress.

141
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:27,199
Mr. Vandervere, why can't you build your
railroad around the Cheyenne lands...

142
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:29,209
instead of across them?

143
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:32,872
Young man, that would delay
construction for over a year...

144
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:34,939
and double the cost.

145
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:38,850
- Yes, Sergeant?
- We found him, sir.

146
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,185
- We had a little trouble.
- Bring him in.

147
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:44,748
A distinguished visitor, gentlemen.
Yellow Hand.

148
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:49,221
Son of ChiefTall Bull.

149
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:52,630
Excellent.
Let's have a look at him.

150
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:56,493
Do you think that we can get him
to listen to reason?

151
00:15:56,571 --> 00:16:00,405
I doubt it. I've gotten nothing
out of any of them.

152
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:12,886
- How, Yellow Hand.
- How, <i>Pahaska.</i>

153
00:16:12,954 --> 00:16:17,391
Tell him his people must move out of
the Smoky Hill country within 30 days.

154
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:21,589
I understand your words.
I've been to white man's school.

155
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:23,995
We've hunted and fished together
since we were so high.

156
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:27,565
Once you saved
Yellow Hand's life.

157
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:32,406
When you do an Indian a favor,
he never forgets it.

158
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:35,773
If you do him bad,
he never forgets that either.

159
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:38,745
Very interesting.
Now, tell us, Yellow Hand...

160
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:41,475
They give themselves
amazing names.

161
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:44,609
Tell us why your people
refuse to obey the order to move.

162
00:16:44,686 --> 00:16:48,452
We must live where
there is food and water and buffalo.

163
00:16:48,523 --> 00:16:51,014
What has the buffalo
got to do with it?

164
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:53,822
Without the buffalo, the Indian
would practically perish.

165
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:57,797
It's his main source of food. In the winter,
the hides protect them from freezing.

166

If you want something
from the Indians...

168

why don't you treat their chiefs the way
you would the heads of any other nations?

169

Understand them, what they're up against.

Maybe they'll be able
to understand you.

The idea is preposterous.

But what a headline!
"Redskin powwow at the Hotel Astor."

Yellow Hand,
do you want us to use force?

178
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:40,374
My people do not want war...

179
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,842

if we must.

180
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,403

181
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:49,780
- Yes. I have my orders.
- All right, Yellow Hand.

183

Tell my brother that if this man
is taken hostage...

211
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:32,239
it will make it easier for the Cheyenne
to make a good peace.

- Certainly I am.

00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:49,156
Doesn't sound like a very good idea
to me. Cheyenne are a shifty lot.

217

I'll attend to the strategy, Cody.
