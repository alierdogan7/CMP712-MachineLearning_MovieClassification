1
00:01:04,077 --> 00:01:06,238
[narrator] Hans Brinker
was a Dutch boy

2
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:09,180
who lived in a small village
by the Zuider Zee.

3
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:12,616
His story takes place
about 100 years ago.

4
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,917
In those days, Holland had
all the quaint characteristics

5
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,255
we have come to think of
as typically Dutch.

6
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:23,353
All the charm and the beauty
captured and passed on to us

7
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,864
in the paintings
of the great Dutch masters,

8
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:29,561
such as Vermeer, Ruisdael,
and Rembrandt.

9
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:36,107
Here, in the fishing village
of our story,

10
00:01:36,176 --> 00:01:38,542
the men pursued
their livelihood on the sea

11
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:42,048
for six hardworking days
each week.

12
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:46,211
But on the seventh,
they took their folks to church.

13
00:01:46,286 --> 00:01:49,722
And that is where they'd been
on the particular Sunday in spring

14
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,724
when our story begins.

15
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:55,319
Among the good burghers
on their way home from Sunday Mass,

16
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:59,331
was a humble family
of fisherfolk called Brinker.

17
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,731
What a wonderful day for a sail.

18
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:04,168
- On Sunday?
- Why not? We've been to church.

19
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:07,206
- We can go to the coast for a picnic.
- Please, Mother.

20
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:09,765
All right.
l'll pack a basket lunch.

21
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:13,404
- May l invite Hilda van Gleck?
- [Raff] Of course.

22
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:18,115
Do you think the burgomaster
will approve?

23
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:20,050
Why shouldn't he?

24
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:25,053
Good day, Mevrouw.
Burgomaster.

25
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,787
We wondered if Hilda
would like to come sailing.

26
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:30,625
- May l, please?
- No, it's out of the question.

27
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:33,894
Besides, we're taking coffee
with the Schimmels.

28
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,959
- l'm sorry, Hans.
- So am l.

29
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:40,495
- Come in, Hilda.
- Another time, perhaps.

30
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:54,381
l would have liked to have
gone sailing with Hans.

31
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:57,548
lt's right that you're polite
to persons like the Brinkers,

32
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:59,649
but you must not
associate with them.

33
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:03,685
Why not? They're decent, honest folk
and it's fun to be with them.

34
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:07,164
Father means you should choose
companions from your own class.

35
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:10,965
Oh, Mother. l suppose he means
someone like Ludwig Schimmel.

36
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:12,868
He bores me.

37
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:16,874
l much prefer the company
of Hans Brinker.

38
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:27,311
[man] Ahoy! Ahoy there!

39
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:37,288
* [accordion playing]

40
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:10,786
Have you ever heard people say
that the Lord created the earth,

41
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:13,833
- but the Dutch made Holland?
- No.

42
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,698
Well, once upon a time,
all the land where we now live

43
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,135
was covered by water.

44
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:20,468
Then our
great-great-grandfathers came

45
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,440
and decided to take it from the sea.

46
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:24,136
- Take it from the sea?
- Yes.

47
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,579
First, they built a big dike, like this,
to keep the ocean back.

48
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:31,640
Then they used windmills
to pump the water out,

49
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:33,948
so they could raise crops
and build towns

50
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,784
- where the sea used to be.
- lt's called the watcher.

51
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:40,348
Because it always keeps
both eyes open, watching the sea.

52
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:44,363
But sometimes a storm drives
the waves over the watcher,

53
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:48,424
- so they built a second dike.
- lt's called the dreamer.

54
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:50,799
lt's only half awake,
until it's needed.

55
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,600
But then it stands there,
holding the water back.

56
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:55,641
And that one?

57
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,802
That last one
is called the sleeper.

58
00:04:57,877 --> 00:05:02,712
lt just lies there, snoozing
like our old cat in front of the fire.

59
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:05,683
But if the sea ever broke
through the two other dikes,

60
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:09,813
the sleeper would wake up
and save us from being drowned.

61
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,619
Now you understand what
people mean when they say,

62
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:16,389
''The Lord created the earth,
but the Dutch made Holland.''

63
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:21,232
- Let me see.
- lt's not very good.

64
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:28,637
Well, l don't know much about it,
but l think you have talent.

65
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,972
l want to learn.
l want to be a good artist.

66
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:35,140
Then you shall be. They say a man can
do anything if he puts his mind to it.

67
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:38,082
- Now, what about a race?
- Good. Where?

68
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:41,552
Over the dike, around the windmill
over there, and then back.

69
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,885
- l'll get back first.
- You mean you'll try.

70
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:45,857
Get ready. Go!

71
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:59,998
[bleating]

72
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:06,303
[cows mooing]

73
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,322
[clucking]

74
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:49,383
Beat him, Father!

75
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:52,152
That wasn't fair.
You pulled me back.

76
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,386
l can't let you beat me yet.

77
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:57,225
- [boy crying]
- [girl] Father, come quickly!

78
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:05,563
Yes, you see what can happen
if you don't keep a close watch.

79
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:09,707
The sea is our friend
because we live by it.

80
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:11,937
But it could also be our enemy,

81
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:15,105
and if we are not careful,
we might die by it.

82
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:19,813
We better be starting for home.

83
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:22,480
Even on Sunday,
the devil can brew a storm.

84
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:32,288
lt's time you two went to bed.

85
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,904
Otherwise, you'll be sleepy
for school tomorrow.

86
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:41,304
Just a little while longer, Mother.

87
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:43,899
- [thunder]
- [Raff] Gretel...

88
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:47,003
[mother] To the loft, both of you.

89
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,514
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, darling.

90
00:07:57,724 --> 00:08:00,659
- [Gretel] Good night, Father.
- Good night.

91
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,464
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, darling.

92
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:11,470
Good night, Father.

93
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:14,063
Don't forget your prayers.

94
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:23,442
[thunder]

95
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:29,588
Metje, have you seen
all these drawings Hans has made?

96
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:32,489
- l've seen them.
- Don't you think they're good?

97
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,960
Perhaps, but he should be
learning a useful trade,

98
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:38,088
not wasting his time
making pictures.

99
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:40,496
Wasting his time?
He wants to be an artist.

100
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:43,798
Holland has too many artists,
all poor.

101
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,670
lsn't that better than being
a poor fisherman, like his father?

102
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,971
l'm serious, Raff.
l'm worried about Hans.

103
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:53,604
Gretel will be all right.
She can cook and sew.

104
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,740
She'll find a husband.
But what will be the future for Hans?

105
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:59,011
l think a man should work
at what he enjoys.

106
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:02,282
l want our children to have
a better life than we've had.

107
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,084
But we are getting along fine.

108
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:07,251
Now, perhaps. But when
winter comes and fishing is poor,

109
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,693
there will be hardly
enough to eat again.

110
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:14,165
Metje, you don't have
to worry anymore.

111
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:17,226
l've been keeping
a surprise for you.

112
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:20,665
- [thunder]
- [Tiel] Mother.

113
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,736
- Mother, what is it?
- Oh, darling. Did it frighten you?

114
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:30,146
Oh, it's such an awful weather.

115
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:31,740
Come, darling.

116
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:34,685
See? See how it rains.

117
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:37,154
lt was so loud.

118
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:41,855
Look.

119
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:43,657
[coins jingling]

120
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,664
Where did you get
all that money?

121
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:47,927
For years, ever since
Gretel was born,

122
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,799
whenever l made an extra guilder,
l put it aside.

123
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,304
First, l filled my tobacco pouch.
Then a sock.

124
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:56,604
And now, do you know
how much we have?

125
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:57,768
No.

126
00:09:57,844 --> 00:10:00,836
- Exactly one thousand guilder.
- Oh, Raff.

127
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:04,111
Now you don't have to
work so hard in your old age.

128
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:07,448
l like to work. Who would want
to sit and just do nothing?

129
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,215
This is for you and the children.

130
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:14,989
lf Hans wants to be an artist,
all l ask is that he's a good one.

131
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:17,723
- Where are you going?
- To hide this where it's safe.

132
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:24,861
Now you're going to bed, darling.

133
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,200
Like...

134
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:28,167
that.

135
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:30,832
- Now, you go to sleep.
- [knocking]

136
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,311
[Kaps] Raff! Open up!

137
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:43,445
Kaps, come in.
You, too, Peter.

138
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:46,984
What brings you out
on a night like this?

139
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,392
The dike at Sloterdam has broken.

140
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:53,091
- They need men to repair it.
- Let's get started then.

141
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,135
- May l go, too, Father?
- Why not? Get dressed.

142
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:03,205
They say it's the worst storm
in 40 years.

143
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:05,744
The waves are breaking
over the seawall.

144
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:13,911
[Raff] Hurry up, Hans.

145
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,118
[thunder]

146
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:22,661
[man] Put your backs into it, men!

147
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:25,289
[wind howling, waves crashing]

148
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:41,203
[man] Keep them coming!

149
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:44,880
More bags.

150
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,489
Ah!

151
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:57,529
- [Hans] Father!
- [thud]

152
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:05,094
[Hans] Help!

153
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:16,739
After him!

154
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,696
[man] He's hurt bad.

155
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,472
Fortunately, the skull wasn't broken.

156
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,916
l think he will be all right in time.

157
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:56,614
When they brought him home,
he didn't even recognize us.

158
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:58,156
That should pass soon.

159
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:01,853
Of course, he has to be
in bed for a while.

160
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:05,389
l'll look in again this evening.

161
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:08,764
Peter and l will be glad
to share our catch with you

162
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:10,928
till Raff is on his feet again.

163
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:13,198
Thank you, Kaps.
You are a good friend.

164
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:16,571
But we'll get along.
Raff managed to put something aside.

165
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:19,702
That's good. We fishermen
live from hand to mouth.

166
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,406
Come on, Peter.

167
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:27,483
You mustn't worry. l'll take
the Sea Beggar out tomorrow.

168
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:34,654
We must ask the good Lord
to make your father well again soon.

169
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:38,026
[narrator] But as the weeks
went by, Raff didn't improve.

170
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:42,329
He could sit by the window now,
but he was listless and vacant.

171
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:44,164
His memory was gone,

172
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:48,037
and with it any recollection of his
savings and their secret hiding place.

173
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,507
lf we could only find
the money your father hid,

174
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,510
we'd have more than enough
to live on.

175
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,637
Why don't you ask him again?

176
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:56,944
Perhaps he'll remember this time.

177
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:09,287
Raff, it's me, your wife.

178
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:12,297
Darling, do you remember
the money you saved?

179
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:16,968
- Money?
- Yes. A thousand guilders.

180
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:21,132
You hid them in a leather bag
the night of the big storm.

181
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:22,606
Storm?

182
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:26,702
You took it into the storeroom,
but we can't find it.

183
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:29,179
We searched everywhere.

184
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:32,274
You must have hidden it well.
Where is it?

185
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:37,779
Love, do you understand?

186
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:41,384
Where is the money
in the leather bag?

187
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:46,758
You must remember.
We need the money desperately!

188
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:50,766
[sobbing]

189
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:59,167
Don't cry, Mother.
Please don't cry.

190
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:01,703
l'm sorry.

191
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:04,147
You eat your soup.
You must be hungry.

192
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:07,546
[narrator] Summer and fall went by,

193
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,952
and somehow
the Brinkers survived.

194
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:11,421
But then...

195
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,117
[wind blowing]

196
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:15,922
to make matters worse,
winter, bitter and severe,

197
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:18,361
came very early that year.

198
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,271
Hans quit school,

199
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,807
for though he was
too young for a steady job,

200
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:33,402
the responsibility for his family's
support now rested on him.

201
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:36,573
No job was too lowly
nor too hard.

202
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:38,810
There were five mouths to feed,

203
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:42,217
and the medicines for his
sick father were costly.

204
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:44,017
[shouting, laughing]

205
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:01,029
Hans, wait!

206
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,843
l haven't seen you for a long time.
Where are you going?

207
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:07,845
l'm taking wood to the tavern.

208
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:09,437
How's your father?

209
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:12,575
Much better, thank you.
He's able to sit up now.

210
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:14,483
That's good.
l missed seeing you.

211
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:17,078
When are you and Gretel
coming back to school?

212
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:20,990
Not for a while. We have to
help out till Father's on his feet.

213
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,255
l hope you're keeping up
with your drawing.

214
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:26,389
l've been too busy fishing all summer
and now doing odd jobs.

215
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:28,194
You mustn't give up your drawing.

216
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:31,293
There are so many artists
much better than l'll ever be.

217
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,703
You're too modest.
My father's bought a lot of pictures,

218
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:37,402
and l don't like them
as well as yours.

219
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:40,445
Promise me that no matter
how difficult it is,

220
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:43,107
you won't give it up.

221
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,150
l'll keep on with it then.

222
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:49,312
Hilda, l thought you
were coming with us.

223
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:50,548
Just a minute, Ludwig.

224
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:52,921
lt was good to see you again.

225
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:54,584
Yes.

226
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,595
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

227
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:05,667
Too bad about
Hans's father, isn't it?

228
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:07,672
- But he is getting better.
- Better?

229
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,173
He's a helpless idiot.

230
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,266
Ludwig, what a terrible thing to say.

231
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:15,178
lt's true. l've seen him
sitting in his window, just staring.

232
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:18,216
They say he doesn't even know
his own wife and children.

233
00:17:18,284 --> 00:17:19,717
Dr. Krupp will cure him.

234
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:22,310
How can anyone cure a man
who's lost his mind?

235
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:23,821
We can hope, can't we?

236
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:26,255
- Good-bye.
- See you tomorrow, Hilda.

237
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:28,793
Bye.

238
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:31,853
l can carry my own
books home, thank you.

239
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:35,700

248
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:01,357
Try the woodcutting mill?

249
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,952
They don't need anyone.
Neither does Schimmel.

250
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:06,589
Times are bad.
l'm lucky to wash pots here.

251
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:10,499
Maybe Captain Jansen will take you on.
He's on his way back to Hoorn.

252
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:12,002
l'll ask him.

00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:25,817
Excuse me, Captain.
l'm Raff Brinker's son.

258
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,682
Oh, is he getting any better?

259
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:29,721
Dr. Krupp says it'll take time.

260
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,019
He ought to see a brain doctor.

261
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:34,321
- A brain doctor?
- Dr. Boekman.

262
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:36,657
Saved my brother when
the others gave him up.

263
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:40,392
- But he'll be expensive.
- He's the best in all the Netherlands.

264
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:43,697
- Can you give me work?
- Pulling my barge?

265
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:46,169
- That's man's work.
- But l'm strong.

266
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:50,106
Next year maybe. See Dr. Boekman.
lf anybody can cure your father, he can.

267
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:53,168
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
- From the beginning. All together.

Who pull the heavy barges

270
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:20,866
Good evening, Father.

271
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,670
- [Metje] You are late.
- l've been looking for work.

272
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:25,175
Didn't you find anything?

273
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:29,146
l made a little delivering wood,
but it won't pay for Father's medicine.

274
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:31,046
We saved some soup for you.

275
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:34,381
You mustn't feel badly, son.
We'll manage somehow.

276
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:36,580
We can't keep taking charity.

277
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:39,715
l know. lf we could only find
the money your father hid,

278
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:42,158
we would have more
than enough to live on.

279
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:48,098
- l'm going to Amsterdam in the morning.
- Why would you go there?

280
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:51,432
l've heard about a famous brain doctor.
A Dr. Boekman.

281
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:53,597
We can't even pay old Dr. Krupp.

282
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:56,140
How can we afford
a famous city doctor?

283
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,733
l'm hoping someone
might buy my drawings.

284
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:00,438
l'll take our lace and sell it.

285
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:03,380
We should get a better price
in the big city.

286
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:11,321
[narrator] So early next morning,
Hans and Gretel went to Amsterdam.

287
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:15,421
The Dutch metropolis
is not only Holland's capital,

288
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:18,156
it's also one of the world's
most exciting places,

289
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,529
proudly called
''the Venice of the north, ''

290
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,128
for it, too, is a city
of islands, bridges and canals.

291
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:32,538
It, too, is a seat
of learning and the arts,

292
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,875
of soaring buildings
and mighty churches,

293
00:20:34,947 --> 00:20:38,940
dynamic with the bustle of business
and world commerce.

294
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:43,286
[organ playing]

295
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:53,231
Under any other circumstances,
this first glimpse of the big city

296
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:56,496
would have been sheer magic
for Hans and Gretel.

297
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:59,094
But even so, it held out hope.

298
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:02,504
Hope to turn their handiwork
into cash.

299
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:04,770
Hope to find the celebrated doctor.

300
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:08,438
Excuse me. Can you tell us
how to find the marketplace?

301
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:10,277
Just cross that bridge there.

302
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:12,010
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

303
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,583
[indistinct chatter]

304
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:23,592
There's a place over there.

305
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:40,335
Oh, look, Henry!
What exquisite lace!

306
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:42,846
Perhaps you'd be interested
in a drawing, sir.

307
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:45,179
This is hardly the place
to show pictures.

308
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,512
Where should l go?

309
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:49,053
- To the street of the art dealers.
- Thank you.

310
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:51,589
lf l have any luck,
l'll call on Dr. Boekman.

311
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:52,885
l'll be waiting for you.

312
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,392
Look, l want this, and perhaps this.

313
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:57,759
Oh, don't be so bored, Henry.

314
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,926
Excuse me. Do you know the way
to the street of the art dealers?

315
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,332
- Over there.
- Thank you.

316
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:04,596
Not at all.

317
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:24,680
Well, what do you think of it?

318
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:26,088
lt's wonderful, sir.

319
00:22:26,158 --> 00:22:29,184
l've never seen anyone use oils before.
ls it difficult?

320
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:32,254
Yes, at first.

321
00:22:32,331 --> 00:22:35,027
Can you tell me where to find
the art dealers?

322
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:38,066
- Are you an artist, too?
- l hope to be.

323
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:40,105
Now l only draw with a pencil.

324
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:42,504
May l see one?

325
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:45,637
Hmm. They're not bad.

326
00:22:45,711 --> 00:22:48,077
There's a strong feeling
for the land here.

327
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:50,047
- ls this your village?
- Yes, sir.

328
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:52,777
l suppose you have come
to Amsterdam to sell them.

329
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:55,445
lf anyone would want
such plain sketches.

330
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:58,513
The old masters often
worked in black and white.

331
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,720
Even the greatest, who once
lived in that house l'm painting.

332
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,786
- Who's that, sir?
- Who was...

333
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:07,766
Why, Rembrandt van Rijn, of course.

334
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,097
Did Rembrandt really live there?

335
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:11,659
[Ruisdael] For 20 years.

336
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:15,764
That was his happy period,
when he was married to Saskia.

337
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:17,604
Didn't he die in poverty?

338
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:21,373
Yes. But l think
he was happy even then,

339
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:24,109
for he had fulfilled
his ambitions.

340
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:27,050
- Do you understand that?
- l think l do, sir.

341
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,849
Come. l'll introduce you
to a friend of mine

342
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:33,858
who has helped a lot of artists
to get started, including me.

343
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:36,258
Will you take this?

344
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,959
No. No.

345
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,365
Think you might take a few
on consignment, Mynheer Dionne?

346
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:45,801
Well, maybe one.

347
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:48,339
lf he sells it, you can
give him a commission.

348
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:49,396
Thank you, sir.

349
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:52,239
Do you know where
l can find a Dr. Boekman?

350
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:55,109
He's living in the big house
on Princengracht.

351
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,444
Why do you want to see him?

352
00:23:57,516 --> 00:24:00,952
My father was in an accident
last spring and lost his memory.

353
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,683
Hmm. So, maybe l can take two more.

354
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,316
Thank you, sir.

355
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:09,553
Thank you.

356
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:13,359
l'm very grateful to you, sir,
but l don't even know your name.

357
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:14,865
Frans Ruisdael.

358
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:18,596
Here's a little present so you can
begin to experiment with colors.

359
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,299
Colors! lt's a wonderful gift.

360
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:25,366
- But you are too generous.
- Oh, no, no, no.

361
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:27,810
Thank you again, sir.

362
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,839
l'll come back as soon as my paintings
are worthy enough.

363
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:46,589
- What's his name?
- Hans. Hans Brinker.

364
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:49,532
Who knows. He might
turn out to be good someday.

365
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:53,230
- Oh, yes. l want to pay for this.
- Put your money away.

366
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:57,366
You think you are the only one
who wants to encourage young talents?

367
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:08,746
[bell ringing]

368
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:11,381
- What is it?
- l'd like to see Dr. Boekman.

369
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:13,048
The doctor sailed for London.

370
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,559
London?
When will he be back?

371
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:19,427
- He'll be away at least two weeks.
- l'll come back then.

372
00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:38,949
- What happened?
- The doctor won't be back for weeks.

373
00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:40,678
Too bad. l sold everything.

374
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:44,552
The rich lady bought the lace.
The rest went for a good price.

375
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:46,022
- Look.
- You did well.

376
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:51,692
- You'd better carry the money home.
- All right.

377
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:56,566
- l saw where Rembrandt lived.
- You did?

378
00:25:56,635 --> 00:25:58,728
And l met a real artist.
Frans Ruisdael.

379
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:01,932
He liked my drawings enough
to introduce me to an art dealer

380
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:05,135
- who will try to sell some for me.
- That's wonderful.

381
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,044
And the artist gave me these paints.
Good ones, too. Now l can try colors.

382
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:12,606
People are kind here.
The rich lady asked about me,

383
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:15,346
and when l told her
how hard it had been for Mother,

384
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,183
she said she'd call on us.

385
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:19,019
That's nice of her, but why?

386
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:21,753
l don't know, but l think
she means to help us.

387
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,317
We must celebrate tonight.

388
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:27,491
Let's ask Kaps and Peter
to have dinner with us for a change.

389
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:38,600
[belches] Ahhh!

390
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:40,645
[laughs]

391
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:43,510
What a good meal, Metje!

392
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:46,847
Like old times, eh, Raff?

393
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,184
Want to play your accordion? Hmm?

394
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,295
[chuckles]

395
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:06,201
Oh, you want me to play it, huh?

396
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:11,572
[accordion playing]

397
00:27:11,643 --> 00:27:15,579
* There's an old sailor song
That we sing all day long

398
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,673
* And we call it
''The wooden shoe waltz''

399
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,244
* When we're far out at sea
This gay melody

400
00:27:23,322 --> 00:27:25,347
* Makes us dream
Of our sweethearts

401
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:28,086
* By the old Zuider Zee

402
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,290
* Oh, my darling, my darling,
My Hollander miss

403
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:36,266
* I'm longing to hug you
And give you a kiss

404
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:40,704
* Then whirl you around while
The band plays with schmaltz

405
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:44,208
* As we dance to the tune of
''The wooden shoe waltz''

406
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:46,039
- * Like this
- [taps shoes]

407
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:48,204
- * Like this
- [taps shoes]

408
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,478
* Then whirl you around
And give you a big kiss

409
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,849
- * Like this
- [kisses]

410
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,047
- * Like this
- [kisses]

411
00:27:57,122 --> 00:28:00,353
* The tune of
''The wooden shoe waltz'' *

412
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:03,087
[laughs]

413
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:09,166
[narrator] But Raff's smile
was only fleeting.

414
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:12,328
The harsh gray winter months
marched by.

415
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:15,703
In those days, when the ice
locked up canals and waterways,

416
00:28:15,774 --> 00:28:18,004
the pulse in those
busy arteries of Holland

417
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,067
came almost to a standstill.

418
00:28:20,145 --> 00:28:23,876
No wonder it became ever more
difficult for Hans to find work,

419
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:27,248
though he tried everything
in his power to help out.

420
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,582
But the urge to be an artist
was equally strong in him.

421
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:35,353
He devoted each leisure hour
to canvas and brush.

422
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:37,759
Hadn't it been the lot
of many a Dutch artist

423
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:40,821
to suffer privations
before attaining fame?

424
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:43,493
And anyway,
he'd promised Hilda

425
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:46,867
that he would not
neglect his talent.

426
00:28:56,848 --> 00:28:59,316
[laughing, chattering]

427
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:09,686
l suppose you want to see
what Hans is painting.

428
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:12,093
l'll join you later.

429
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:16,898
[boy] Come on.
The ice is better over there.

430
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,430
Hello, Hans.

431
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:23,440
- Hello, Hilda.
- May l see?

432
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:25,408
Oh, it's wonderful!

433
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:27,775
lt's so exciting to work in colors.

434
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:31,714
Things used to seem dull and gray,
but now l see everything differently.

435
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:34,149
- Do you, Hans?
- lt's all because of you.

436
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:37,518
Now l feel confident.
l believe in myself.

437
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:39,682
l'm glad.

438
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:41,817
l am anxious
to try a portrait next.

439
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:44,293
How would you like to paint me?

440
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:47,263
l'd like to very much.
When?

441
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:50,096
ls tomorrow all right,
after school?

442
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:52,398
Fine. l'd ask you
to come to our house,

443
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:54,962
but Father isn't feeling
too well these days.

444
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,338
l know where we can go.
lnside the mill.

445
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:00,207
- lt's warm, and boss won't mind.
- l'll be waiting.

446
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:04,112
l'd like to surprise Father
with it on St. Nicholas Day.

447
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:06,116
Maybe he'll want to buy it.

448
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:09,517
Oh, l wouldn't feel right
about selling it to you.

449
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:23,995
Good evening, sir.

450
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:25,730
Good evening.

451
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,107
- Very good coffee. Thank you.
- [knock on door]

452
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:33,144
Come in, young man.

453
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:36,237
As l was saying, my husband
and l have no children.

454
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:37,906
We are quite well-to-do.

455
00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:41,248
We live in a house with
more rooms than we can use.

456
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,722
Mynheer Korbes has consented
to let me investigate conditions here.

457
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,886
l admit, l expected to find
a sordid atmosphere.

458
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:53,260
Even drunkenness, perhaps.

459
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:57,031
[Mrs. Korbes] But l must say,
l'm relieved.

460
00:30:57,102 --> 00:31:00,162
Everything is quite clean
and tidy, despite your poverty.

461
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:03,264
Gretel, you would like
to live in a big nice house

462
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,832
with servants and good food,
wouldn't you?

463
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:08,311
l hardly need to remind you
of the advantages

464
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,974
that Gretel would have
that's she's missing now.

465
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:15,110
But, Mevrouw Korbes,
l couldn't leave my family.

466
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:16,745
Do you mean...

467
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:19,449
You mean that you would
prefer to live here?

468
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:22,459
We're very happy together.

469
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:25,792
Of course, you could visit Gretel
whenever you wish.

470
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:29,163
My husband is prepared
to send you a sum from time to time,

471
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:31,202
until your husband is able to work.

472
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:34,568
Thank you for your good intentions,
Mevrouw Korbes,

473
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:36,971
but l could never give up
one of my children.

474
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:39,306
But...

475
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:42,904
l hope you understand.
We are all so close...

476
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:46,542
Perhaps if you raised children
of your own, you'd know what l mean.

477
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:48,848
A family is something
you never separate,

478
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,581
no matter how poor you are.

479
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:55,957
Well, it's your decision.
l only wanted to help you.

480
00:31:57,495 --> 00:32:01,727
l think you'll come to realize
you're not being fair to Gretel.

481
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:06,493
Here's my husband's card
if you change your mind.

482
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:09,301
- Gretel.
- Good evening.

483
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:15,004
And l thought
she came to help us.

484
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,945
Oh, she meant well, Hans.

485
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:22,112
You can't blame one who can't understand
what a family means to each other.

486
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:41,602
- Hello, boss.
- Hello.

487
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:42,662
Hello, boss.

488
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:45,642
Hans is going to do my portrait
as a surprise for Father.

489
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,337
Ah, it should be interesting.

490
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:49,277
lt may not turn out
like Rembrandt,

491
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:51,542
but the light and shadows
are the same.

492
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:56,718
Well, well.
What's the matter, Ludwig?

493
00:32:56,788 --> 00:32:59,416
You haven't carried
Hilda's books home lately.

494
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:01,482
- No, sir.
- Have you had a falling out?

495
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,027
l don't think l should tell you, sir.

496
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:06,859
Tell me what? lf it concerns
my daughter, speak up.

497
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:10,059
Well, l don't believe
in carrying tales, sir.

498
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:12,103
Tales? Tales?
What do you mean?

499
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,467
Well...

500
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:16,302
Hilda's been meeting secretly
with Hans Brinker.

501
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:17,363
What?

502
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:20,900
l just saw them
go into Boss' windmill alone.

503
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:24,142
Boss' windmill alone?

504
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:37,050
Ja, it's coming pretty good.
lt even looks like her.

505
00:33:37,128 --> 00:33:38,425
[laughs]

506
00:33:38,496 --> 00:33:40,896
l'll get some more firewood.

507
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:55,742
Mind if l rest a moment?

508
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:57,338
No, of course not.

509
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:07,187
Oh, it's going to be good.
Father will be very pleased.

510
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:15,760
So, this is how you abuse
my confidence, Hilda?

511
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:18,064
- l'm ashamed of you.
- But, Father!

512
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:20,730
Go home at once.
You'll be punished later.

513
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:23,273
[sobs]

514
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:29,745
Hans Brinker, l forbid you
to ever see my daughter again.

515
00:34:29,814 --> 00:34:31,406
But you don't understand, sir.

516
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:32,814
Silence!

517
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:36,149
You're an insolent peasant.

518
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:39,554
lf l ever hear you're meeting
secretly with Hilda again,

519
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:41,615
l'll have you horsewhipped!

520
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:43,716
[growls]

521
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:55,335
Oh, what's the good burgomaster
so upset about?

522
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:57,398
Didn't he like your painting?

523
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,787
Hans, have you seen your father?

524
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:20,330
- No.
- He's wandered off somewhere.

525
00:35:20,398 --> 00:35:22,696
l'm afraid something terrible happened.

526
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:26,032
- l'll find him. Take this and go home.
- All right.

527
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:41,886
lt's the idiot!

528
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:26,689
Where is he?

529
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:28,095
Down by the canal.

530
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,532
You stay here.
l'll get the watchman.

531
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:32,900
[dog barks]

532
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:38,834
[barking continues]

533
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:49,185
Father!

534
00:36:49,254 --> 00:36:52,018
lt's me, Father.
Come back home, won't you, please?

535
00:36:57,128 --> 00:36:58,857
There he is.

536
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:04,693
Arrest him.

537
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:19,208
lt's Raff!
Come on and help!

538
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:26,048
lt's me, Raff.
Your old friend.

539
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:27,921
Come on. Let's go home.

540
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:37,462
[woman] They shouldn't
let him run around like this.

541
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:39,435
[man] He should be put away.

542
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:43,440
- [woman #2] Oh, it's terrible.
- Poor Metje.

543
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:49,241
Well, he's quiet now.
You should all take some rest.

544
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:50,781
How can we rest?

545
00:37:50,848 --> 00:37:54,249
l'm afraid, Kaps. Poor Raff
doesn't know what he's done.

546
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:56,310
[knock on door]

547
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:04,818
You know what
they're saying in the tavern?

548
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:07,763
That they're going to send
your father to an asylum.

549
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,399
l'm sorry.
l wish we could help.

550
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:14,029
You've done everything you could.
Thank you.

551
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:16,039
We better be going, Peter.

552
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:21,744
You mustn't worry.
Dr. Boekman is due back soon.

553
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:23,610
l am going to see him.

554
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:26,445
How are we going to pay
such an expensive doctor?

555
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:30,817
- l hope the dealer sold my drawings.
- You mustn't count on that.

556
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:35,518
lf worst comes to worst,
l can let the rich lady adopt me.

557
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:38,255
- Oh, no.
- No, Gretel, you won't have to do that.

558
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:39,921
l'll find something.

559
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:43,058
[narrator] Hans and Gretel
redoubled their efforts,

560
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:45,659
but the promise of a solution
for their troubles

561
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:48,001
came from an entirely
unexpected source.

562
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:49,562
Hans! Gretel!

563
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:52,633
Have you heard about the competition
on St. Nicholas Day?

564
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,372
That's the one with the prize
of the silver skates.

565
00:38:55,446 --> 00:38:58,813
There's 300 guilders, too,
for the boy and girl who wins it.

566
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:01,909
This is the miracle
we've been waiting for.

567
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:03,510
Even if we get in the finals,

568
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:07,080
we'll be up against the best skaters
on the whole Zuider Zee.

569
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:09,285
Who cares?
We all have the same chance.

570
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,022
lf one of us wins,
our problems will be solved.

571
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:13,688
We better go sign up now.

572
00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:16,495
Come on.
l'll race you to the town hall.

573
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:18,398
Go!

574
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:22,269
[narrator] And so the possibility of
winning the prize in the great race

575
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,274
kindled new hope
in Hans and Gretel.

576
00:39:24,342 --> 00:39:27,743
Here, indeed, was a possible solution
to their many problems.

577
00:39:27,812 --> 00:39:29,507
This coming event added, also,

578
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,845
more excitement to one of the
most delightful Dutch holidays,

579
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:39,618
St. Nicholas Day, the time when St. Nick
appears on his handsome white steed.

580
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,920
It is a time for parties
and the giving of gifts,

581
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:48,898
much like our Christmas.

582
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:52,800
At the mayor's house,
as in most homes along the Zuider Zee,

583
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,998
there was only one topic
of conversation that evening:

584
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:59,475
tomorrow's qualifying races
to pick the contestants

585
00:39:59,544 --> 00:40:02,843
for the big silver skate event
just two weeks away.

586
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:08,111
Hilda and l are going to win first
places in the competition tomorrow.

587
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:11,121
Don't be so sure.
Our town is famous for good skaters.

588
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:15,455
- Like Hans Brinker?
- Yes, like Hans and his sister.

589
00:40:17,195 --> 00:40:20,426
- Cakes?
- [Ludwig] They shouldn't be allowed.

590
00:40:20,498 --> 00:40:22,659
- Why not?
- They only have wooden skates.

591
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:26,727
- l don't see why it makes a difference.
- Wooden skates are dangerous.

592
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:28,704
They can cause an accident.

593
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:31,298
Hans and Gretel
seem to do all right on theirs.

594
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:55,765
lt's almost time for St. Nicholas
to be arriving on his white steed.

595
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,825
So let's sing a welcome song
for him. All together.

596
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:01,770
* Hear the hoof beats on the roof

597
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,330
* We don't need more further proof

598
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:07,138
* Good St. Nick is coming

599
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:09,873
* He will fill each little wooden shoe

600
00:41:09,947 --> 00:41:12,609
* If you're good you'll be
Getting something too

601
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:15,709
* Good St. Nick is coming

602
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:18,415
* Welcome, St. Nicholas

603
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:21,424
* Bring us cheer

604
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:27,488
* For we only see you but once a year

605
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:30,591
* Hear the hoof beats on the roof

606
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:33,364
* We don't need more further proof

607
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:36,406
* Good St. Nick is coming

608
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:37,998
* He will fill...

609
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,912
- [children shouting]
- Come, children.

610
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,344
Well, hello, little boys and girls.

611
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:53,413
l hope you've all been
good children during the year.

612
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:55,288
- Oh, yes.
- We've been good.

613
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,348
So have l.

614
00:41:56,427 --> 00:42:00,386
[laughing] l'm glad to hear it,
for tonight, when you're asleep,

615
00:42:00,464 --> 00:42:02,489
l'll bring presents down the chimney

616
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:05,331
into the shoes
of all the good boys and girls.

617
00:42:05,403 --> 00:42:09,464
But l will bring switches
to those who have been bad.

618
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,168
You see, l know everything
that's gone on,

619
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:16,771
like not studying your lessons,
or squirming in church,

620
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:18,782
or not obeying your parents.

621
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:22,183
Some of you could even be guilty
of throwing snowballs

622
00:42:22,253 --> 00:42:25,347
at gentlemen in high hats.

623
00:42:25,423 --> 00:42:28,915
But next year, l'm sure
you will all be little angels again.

624
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:32,952
Now l must be off to visit other
children all over the country.

625
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,657
So help yourself to the sweets,

626
00:42:34,732 --> 00:42:38,099
and l wish you all a happy
and merry St. Nicholas Day.

627
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:45,506
Hurry up, children.
You mustn't catch cold.

628
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:09,757
What are you doing?

629
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:15,295
What are you doing sneaking
around in the dark like a thief?

630
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:18,137
l was just passing, Your Honor.
l mean, Your Holiness.

631
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:20,541
l have this present for the burgomaster.

632
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:22,340
Present?

633
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:26,315
l am the one who gives presents, my boy.

634
00:43:30,988 --> 00:43:32,580
When did you do this?

635
00:43:32,657 --> 00:43:35,091
The last few nights.
l painted it from memory.

636
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:39,795
Well, l'm sure the burgomaster
will like it.

637
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:42,264
But now you better be off home.

638
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,597
Yes, Your Holiness...
Uh, Your Grace.

639
00:43:54,745 --> 00:43:56,838
l thought everyone had a good time.

640
00:43:56,914 --> 00:44:01,715
- Oh, yes, especially Father.
- How he loves to play St. Nicholas.

641
00:44:03,187 --> 00:44:05,712
Hilda, have you been seeing
the Brinker boy lately?

642
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:08,020
No, not since you forbade me to.

643
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:10,925
Hmm. Why don't you
let those go and get some sleep.

644
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:13,623
- You want to be fresh for the contest.
- All right.

645
00:44:13,698 --> 00:44:16,132
Good night. Thanks for the party.

646
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,600
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, dear.

647
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:27,870
l saw that Brinker boy outside
looking in on the party.

648
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:31,244
- What did you do?
- Sent him away, of course.

649
00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:34,045
We really should've
invited the Brinkers this year.

650
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:36,882
lt's been a trying time for them.

651
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:42,620
Hilda says Hans and Gretel
are entered in the competition.

652
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:45,127
But they only have
their wooden skates.

653
00:44:45,196 --> 00:44:47,790
Why don't you send
Hilda's old ones to the girl?

654
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:51,164
That's what l hoped you'd say.

655
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:12,017
Wasn't it nice of Kaps
and Peter to remember Tiel?

656
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:14,023
They've had a hard winter, too.

657
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:16,616
- l carved these for him.
- He'll love them.

658
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:18,924
lt isn't much.

659
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:22,261
We have a lot to be grateful for.

660
00:45:25,302 --> 00:45:30,239
Raff used to look forward to
St. Nicholas Day as much as you did.

661
00:45:32,743 --> 00:45:36,474
l remember how excited you used
to be to wake up in the morning

662
00:45:36,547 --> 00:45:38,481
and find your shoes overflowing.

663
00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:41,211
Sometimes he'd go
without tobacco for a month

664
00:45:41,285 --> 00:45:44,049
so he could bring you apples
and gingerbread men.

665
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:46,112
[knocking]

666
00:46:08,779 --> 00:46:10,770
- Who brought it?
- l don't know.

667
00:46:10,848 --> 00:46:13,112
Perhaps there's a card inside.

668
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:16,153
- Oh.
- Look.

669
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,619
What it this?

670
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:23,154
Oh, it must be for you, Gretel.

671
00:46:23,227 --> 00:46:25,491
Now l have a chance to win tomorrow.

672
00:46:25,563 --> 00:46:29,090
- lsn't it wonder...
- l can skate fine on wooden ones.

673
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,031
Let's show your father.

674
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:37,339
Look, Raff. We have good friends
who remembered us.

675
00:46:37,408 --> 00:46:40,036
All this wonderful food
you need to make you strong.

676
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:44,207
Tomorrow Hans and Gretel are going to
enter the competition, and they may win.

677
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:47,341
Look. Gretel has real skates.

678
00:46:50,955 --> 00:46:55,585
The competition has narrowed
down to six boys and six girls.

679
00:46:55,659 --> 00:47:00,119
We shall now select
the finalists for the big race.

680
00:47:00,197 --> 00:47:02,722
The girls will take
their starting positions.

681
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,665
Good luck.

682
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:09,598
You'll race out to the barrel,
circle it, and return.

683
00:47:10,674 --> 00:47:13,268
The first three to finish
will have the honor

684
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:17,041
of representing our village
in the big race, the 20th.

685
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:18,843
On your marks.

686
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:21,282
Get ready. Go!

687
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,611
[all cheering]

688
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,338
Come on, Gretel.
Come on.

689
00:48:21,745 --> 00:48:23,906
[all cheering]

690
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:29,819
Wonderful, Gretel.
You did it.

691
00:48:29,887 --> 00:48:32,754
Congratulations, Hilda.
lt was a good race.

692
00:48:32,823 --> 00:48:33,949
The winners are:

693
00:48:34,024 --> 00:48:37,687
Hilda van Gleck, Gretel Brinker,
and Katrinka Flack.

694
00:48:39,496 --> 00:48:42,522
And now, the boys will take
their starting positions.

695
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,295
Good luck, Hans.

696
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:47,166
At least get in the finals like l did.

697
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:56,272
You'll race across the bay, up the canal
as far as the marker, then return.

698
00:48:56,347 --> 00:48:58,076
Don't get behind Brinker.

699
00:48:58,148 --> 00:49:01,709
lf he hits rough ice with those
snowplows, he'll break his neck.

700
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,710
On your marks.

701
00:49:04,788 --> 00:49:06,517
Get ready.

702
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:09,718
Hey! Come back
and wait for my signal!

703
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:14,797
On your marks.

704
00:49:14,865 --> 00:49:16,264
Get ready.

705
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,493
Go!

706
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,639
Hans is keeping up.

707
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:28,041
But it's a long way to go.
Come on, Hans.

708
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:09,715
Beat him, Hans!

709
00:50:20,297 --> 00:50:23,289
Never mind, Hans!
You can catch up!

710
00:51:14,952 --> 00:51:17,079
That's my boy in the lead.

711
00:51:22,393 --> 00:51:23,690
Beat him!
Beat him!

712
00:51:34,972 --> 00:51:37,907
Ludwig, what happened?

713
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:42,071
You were first. You were in the lead.
Why did you let him beat you?

714
00:51:46,483 --> 00:51:48,951
And the winners are:
Hans Brink...

715
00:51:52,055 --> 00:51:57,220
Hans Brinker, Ludwig Schimmel,
and Peter Bouman.

716
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:09,197
lf my son had tried, he could
easily have come in first.

717
00:52:09,273 --> 00:52:13,937
But he didn't. Hans Brinker
beat him, and on wooden skates.

718
00:52:14,011 --> 00:52:16,707
ln the big race,
Brinker won't have a chance.

719
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:19,010
Who do you think'll win,
Mynheer Schimmel?

720
00:52:19,082 --> 00:52:24,543
My Ludwig, of course.
l've been giving him some pointers.

721
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:27,852
l'd put my money on Peter,
not because he is my son,

722
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:30,325
but it takes endurance
to skate 26 miles.

723
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:33,090
And Peter is a strong lad,
big for his age.

724
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:37,395
l'll wager 20 guilders
that Ludwig comes in ahead.

725
00:52:37,468 --> 00:52:39,527
l'll take that bet.

726
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:44,505
Make a note of that.

727
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:50,704
Forgive me, but l hope that spoiled brat
of his falls and breaks...

728
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:53,045
Ah, ah, ah, Kaps.

729
00:52:53,116 --> 00:52:57,883
At least we all agree that someone
from our village will win.

730
00:52:57,955 --> 00:53:00,389
l think you're all crowing
a little too soon.

731
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:04,154
Have you heard of a boy at Hoorn
they call ''Charles the Champion''?

732
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:06,287
He won the last two years.

733
00:53:06,363 --> 00:53:09,764
That's right.
And he won't be 1 9 until next month.

734
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,926
So, he's entered again.

735
00:53:12,002 --> 00:53:14,027
[bargemen laughing]

736
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:21,611
[narrator] On the day
the famous surgeon was due back,

737
00:53:21,678 --> 00:53:24,442
Hans went to Amsterdam.

738
00:53:32,656 --> 00:53:36,183
With skates like those,
how much better would be his chances

739
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,354
to win the race and pay
for the doctor's services.

740
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:43,627
Perhaps the art dealer
had sold one of his drawings.

741
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:51,102
You won't find anyone in there.
The shopkeeper is ill.

742
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:52,505
He went home.

743
00:54:05,122 --> 00:54:07,317
[bell ringing]

744
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:15,254
- lt's you.
- Has the doctor returned?

745
00:54:15,332 --> 00:54:18,324
This morning, but l'd advise
to come back tomorrow.

746
00:54:18,402 --> 00:54:20,336
But l must see him today.

747
00:54:20,404 --> 00:54:23,965
l'm sorry. He has given
strict orders to admit no one.

748
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:26,908
He is not feeling well.
He had a rough crossing.

749
00:54:26,977 --> 00:54:29,946
l can't leave without talking to him.
Please.

750
00:54:30,013 --> 00:54:31,913
My father needs help badly.

751
00:54:31,982 --> 00:54:37,443
Very well, but l warn you,
he'll be furious with both of us.

752
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:42,181
Excuse me, Dr. Boekman.

753
00:54:42,259 --> 00:54:44,693
Didn't l tell you
l was not to be disturbed?

754
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:47,696
Whatever you're selling,
l don't want it.

755
00:54:47,764 --> 00:54:50,665
- l'm not selling anything, sir.
- What's that you carry?

756
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:54,397
- Paintings to show an art dealer.
- l'm much too busy to see anyone.

757
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:57,269
But this can't wait, sir.
lt's about my father.

758
00:54:57,341 --> 00:55:00,071
He had a head injury last spring
and lost his memory.

759
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:03,442
l'm sorry. l can't take on
any new patients at this time.

760
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:05,913
Couldn't you just
come and look at him?

761
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,884
Frankly, no. My work has piled up
since l've been away.

762
00:55:08,952 --> 00:55:11,944
Captain Jansen said if anyone
could cure him, you could.

763
00:55:12,022 --> 00:55:15,321
- Who's Captain Jansen?
- Commander of a barge over at Hoorn.

764
00:55:15,392 --> 00:55:17,883
You cured his brother
when everyone gave up.

765
00:55:17,961 --> 00:55:20,293
Oh, yes. lnteresting case.
Amnesia.

766
00:55:20,364 --> 00:55:23,231
Won't you see
if there's any hope?

767
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,791
- You're very persistent.
- l have to be.

768
00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:28,303
People in our village
think he's dangerous.

769
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:30,670
They want him locked up
in an institution.

770
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:38,072
- Order my sleigh at once.
- Yes, doctor.

771
00:55:38,148 --> 00:55:41,015
Well, come on.
You've got to show me where you live.

772
00:56:14,885 --> 00:56:16,443
[indistinct murmuring]

773
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:22,352
Well, l think the children
should be consulted.

774
00:56:22,426 --> 00:56:23,825
What is it, Mother?

775
00:56:23,894 --> 00:56:27,295
The doctor says an operation
may restore his memory,

776
00:56:27,364 --> 00:56:28,831
but it's very dangerous.

777
00:56:28,899 --> 00:56:30,958
You mean Father might die?

778
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:35,130
Any operation where pressure on the
brain is concerned is highly delicate.

779
00:56:35,205 --> 00:56:38,436
Fortunately, the patient
appears to be strong physically.

780
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:42,342
l think he has a good chance
of getting through it.

781
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:46,280
But we know that no matter
how dangerous, it's necessary.

782
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:48,340
Don't we?

783
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:51,045
- Yes, Mother.
- Yes.

784
00:56:51,121 --> 00:56:53,817
When will you do it, doctor?

785
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,450
l have a very full schedule
since l've been away.

786
00:56:56,526 --> 00:57:00,462
Let me see.
Two amputations and, uh...

787
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:02,760
Well, there's no opening
until the 20th.

788
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:05,666
Bring him to the Amsterdam
hospital the day before.

789
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:08,204
Yes, l will.

790
00:57:08,271 --> 00:57:11,672
l'm prescribing some medicine
to quiet his nerves

791
00:57:11,742 --> 00:57:14,540
if he should be restless again.

792
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:19,177
See he has plenty
of good nourishing food.

793
00:57:19,249 --> 00:57:21,945
Meat, preferably red wine.

794
00:57:22,018 --> 00:57:25,476
- Thank you for coming, Doctor.
- Oh, not at all.

795
00:57:25,555 --> 00:57:28,718
Well, this will be all for today.

796
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:30,760
- Doctor...
- Huh?

797
00:57:30,827 --> 00:57:34,160
l know you're expensive,
so it's only fair to tell you,

798
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:36,426
we can't pay for a while.

799
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,766
lt's not my custom to send a bill
until after l have rendered my services.

800
00:57:40,837 --> 00:57:42,600
Good day.

801
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:45,334
[narrator] As the day
of the great race drew near,

802
00:57:45,408 --> 00:57:48,809
the contestants in the participating
villages by the Zuider Zee

803
00:57:48,879 --> 00:57:53,111
spent every spare moment
practicing for the event.

804
00:57:58,522 --> 00:58:02,288
- Have you seen Hans anywhere?
- He's embarrassed on his wooden skates,

805
00:58:02,359 --> 00:58:05,021
so he's practicing at the point
where no one can see him.

806
00:58:05,095 --> 00:58:06,960
Thanks.

807
00:58:18,141 --> 00:58:19,369
Did you hurt yourself?

808
00:58:19,442 --> 00:58:22,377
lt's these old wooden skates,
but l'm getting better.

809
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:26,006
lt's just a question
of jumping over the rough spots.

810
00:58:32,222 --> 00:58:33,883
Still meeting secretly, huh?

811
00:58:33,957 --> 00:58:35,322
What do you mean?

812
00:58:35,392 --> 00:58:39,294
A pretty little scene.
Not as comfortable as the mill, is it?

813
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:41,421
How did you know about that?

814
00:58:41,498 --> 00:58:46,231
Everyone knows that Hilda's father
forbade her to see you again.

815
00:58:46,303 --> 00:58:48,567
But he didn't know
about the mill.

816
00:58:48,638 --> 00:58:50,833
You're the one
who told the burgomaster.

817
00:58:50,907 --> 00:58:52,602
What if l did?

818
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,469
You are contemptible.

819
00:58:56,513 --> 00:58:58,413
Get your skates off.

820
00:59:56,706 --> 01:00:00,403
My Ludwig was attacked today
by the son of that madman Brinker.

821
01:00:00,477 --> 01:00:03,071
Without provocation, mind you.

822
01:00:03,146 --> 01:00:06,274
As a member of the town council,
l strongly feel

823
01:00:06,349 --> 01:00:09,011
that a boy like Hans Brinker
should not be allowed

824
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:10,882
to represent our town in the race.

825
01:00:10,954 --> 01:00:14,651
- You sure it was without provocation?
- l have Ludwig's word for it.

826
01:00:14,724 --> 01:00:17,750
l heard from my daughter,
who happened to be present,

827
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:21,558
and she feels that young Brinker
was entirely justified.

828
01:00:22,299 --> 01:00:25,496
And, frankly, so do l.
Good evening.

829
01:00:32,575 --> 01:00:35,635
[narrator] On the eve of Raff's
removal to the hospital,

830
01:00:35,712 --> 01:00:39,375
the Brinkers faced two of the most
critical situations of their lives:

831
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:43,283
Raff's operation
and the race for the big prize.

832
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:46,686
No wonder the immediate future
held for the little family

833
01:00:46,756 --> 01:00:49,224
a mixture of fear and of hope.

834
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,452
You are going to shave before
we take you to the hospital.

835
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:55,964
l can't let you
frighten the nurses.

836
01:00:56,032 --> 01:00:59,729
Dr. Boekman is going to
make you well again. l know.

837
01:01:02,305 --> 01:01:04,637
Who's going to take care of Tiel
when we go?

838
01:01:05,608 --> 01:01:08,907
Old Maria's going to take care of him.

839
01:01:20,657 --> 01:01:23,387
Amsterdam hospital,
at your service.

840
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,189
Thank you very much
for the ride.

841
01:01:25,261 --> 01:01:28,662
Will you pick up Hans and be
at the marketplace this afternoon?

842
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:30,927
But not later than 4:00.

843
01:01:31,001 --> 01:01:34,232
l hope everything goes well.

844
01:01:42,012 --> 01:01:44,913
l think it's best you say
good-bye to your father now.

845
01:01:48,952 --> 01:01:50,920
Good-bye, Father.

846
01:01:55,959 --> 01:01:58,086
[Gretel] Mother, we hate to leave you.

847
01:01:58,161 --> 01:02:00,789
lf it wasn't for the money
we may win, we'd give it up.

848
01:02:00,864 --> 01:02:04,493
Of course you won't.
There's nothing you can do now.

849
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:06,501
What time are the races tomorrow?

850
01:02:06,569 --> 01:02:09,436
Girls start at 1 0:00
and the boys go right after us.

851
01:02:09,506 --> 01:02:12,475
Hans, when do you think you
will be reaching Amsterdam?

852
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:15,670
Early afternoon.
We turn back when at King's Bridge.

853
01:02:15,745 --> 01:02:19,237
lf the operation is over
and if your father is out of danger,

854
01:02:19,315 --> 01:02:21,374
l'll wave to you from the bridge.

855
01:02:24,154 --> 01:02:25,416
God be with you.

856
01:02:26,456 --> 01:02:27,548
God be with you.

857
01:02:31,895 --> 01:02:34,386
Come on, darling.

858
01:02:41,604 --> 01:02:44,232
l'll come to the marketplace
as soon as l can.

859
01:02:44,307 --> 01:02:46,241
All right.

860
01:03:02,258 --> 01:03:04,624
Can you help a poor cripple?

861
01:03:18,808 --> 01:03:20,571
Can you help
a poor cripple?

862
01:03:20,643 --> 01:03:23,203
No, l am sorry.

863
01:03:26,149 --> 01:03:27,946
Beggars are not allowed in here.

864
01:03:28,017 --> 01:03:29,985
l am not a beggar, sir.
l am an artist.

865
01:03:30,053 --> 01:03:32,078
- [laughing]
- Aren't they the same?

866
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:33,622
You made a good purchase.

867
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,681
Ruisdael is becoming quite popular.

868
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:38,659
- Yes, so l understand. Good day.
- Good day, sir.

869
01:03:38,728 --> 01:03:41,663
- ls Mynheer Dionne around?
- Oh, he died two weeks ago.

870
01:03:41,731 --> 01:03:44,325
Went home ill and never recovered.

871
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,494
- l'm sorry.
- Everything's in quite a mess.

872
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:49,629
l'm his nephew.
l'm here to take over.

873
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:53,198
Do you know if he sold my drawings?
l left some pencil sketches.

874
01:03:53,276 --> 01:03:55,107
Oh, those. Yes.

875
01:03:55,178 --> 01:03:58,306
l'm glad to get rid of them.
They take up space.

876
01:03:58,381 --> 01:03:59,848
- Are these yours?
- Yes.

877
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,941
Now l have better ones.
ln oils. See?

878
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:06,284
- Perhaps you'd be interested in these?
- l'm selling out. Not buying.

879
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:13,357
Thank you, sir.

880
01:04:35,552 --> 01:04:39,613
- Are you badly hurt?
- A thief! He stole all my money!

881
01:06:46,182 --> 01:06:48,514
Open the door!
Open up!

882
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:50,711
Help!

883
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:05,692
Help! Police! l'm in here!
Help me get out!

884
01:07:18,781 --> 01:07:21,579
What did the boy
who ran after him look like?

885
01:07:21,651 --> 01:07:22,640
Like any beggar.

886
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,155
l wouldn't be surprised if he
wasn't in league with that cutthroat.

887
01:07:26,222 --> 01:07:28,349
They often work in pairs.

888
01:07:28,424 --> 01:07:32,554
- Did the boy leave these paintings?
- And those dreadful drawings, too.

889
01:07:32,628 --> 01:07:35,119
He's no thief. l know him.
He's a friend of mine.

890
01:07:35,198 --> 01:07:37,359
Try and find him.
He might be in trouble.

891
01:07:37,433 --> 01:07:39,526
Yes. Come on.

892
01:08:04,026 --> 01:08:06,221
l am sorry,
but l can't wait any longer.

893
01:08:06,295 --> 01:08:08,559
l can't understand
what's happened to Hans.

894
01:08:08,631 --> 01:08:11,259
He knows we have to be back
for the races tomorrow.

895
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:16,499
lf he doesn't come soon,
l think you'd better go to the police.

896
01:08:21,978 --> 01:08:25,004
[narrator] Exhausted by
his vain efforts to get free,

897
01:08:25,081 --> 01:08:28,448
his troubled mind filled with
concern for tomorrow's events,

898
01:08:28,518 --> 01:08:32,648
Hans spent a night
of frustration and anxiety.

899
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:44,384
[Hans] Help me! Help me!

900
01:10:48,424 --> 01:10:51,689
[man] Who called for help?
Where are you?

901
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:57,658
Here! l'm locked in,
and can't get out!

902
01:10:57,733 --> 01:11:02,500
Oh, ho! You must be the boy
the police are looking for.

903
01:11:02,572 --> 01:11:06,633
Wait till l call them,
and we'll have you out in a jiffy.

904
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:09,041
We've been looking
all night for you.

905
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:11,773
Can you show us the ship
where you saw this cripple?

906
01:11:11,847 --> 01:11:14,680
- First l must find my sister.
- Don't worry about her.

907
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,877
She's sleeping in a warm police station.

908
01:11:16,953 --> 01:11:19,513
Well, come on then.
lt's nearby.

909
01:11:33,102 --> 01:11:34,569
What do you want?

910
01:11:34,637 --> 01:11:38,232
May l speak to the man
with the crutch, please?

911
01:11:38,307 --> 01:11:40,502
Someone wants to see you.

912
01:11:42,712 --> 01:11:43,872
How did you...

913
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:57,725
l can't thank you enough, Brinker.

914
01:11:57,793 --> 01:12:00,785
l'll even take your paintings.
On consignment, of course.

915
01:12:00,863 --> 01:12:04,856
Doesn't he get a reward
for recovering the money?

916
01:12:04,934 --> 01:12:08,529
- Certainly. Here you are.
- [coins jingling]

917
01:12:08,604 --> 01:12:10,401
Five guilders.

918
01:12:10,473 --> 01:12:13,704
Gretel, it's almost enough
to buy some new skates l saw.

919
01:12:13,776 --> 01:12:17,177
- How much more do you need?
- Two more guilders.

920
01:12:19,382 --> 01:12:22,715
Two more guilders.

921
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:24,878
[Gretel] We have to pick up my skates.

922
01:12:24,954 --> 01:12:29,789
- We'll never get to the dike by 1 0:00.
- Unless we find a sleigh.

923
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:33,795
l'm sure Mynheer Dionne will be
happy to loan us his. Come on.

924
01:12:35,598 --> 01:12:39,557
[* band playing folk tune]

925
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,742
- l don't think they're coming.
- Why wouldn't they?

926
01:12:53,816 --> 01:12:56,683
Maybe they realized
Hans doesn't have a chance.

927
01:12:56,752 --> 01:13:00,119
They had to take their father
to Amsterdam, but they'll be here.

928
01:13:00,189 --> 01:13:03,215
As soon as the dance is over,
l shall call the girls' race.

929
01:13:03,292 --> 01:13:06,352
But, Your Lordship,
two of our contestants are missing.

930
01:13:06,429 --> 01:13:09,557
- Nevertheless, we shall proceed.
- But...

931
01:13:22,745 --> 01:13:25,908
- Where are Hans and Gretel?
- We'll be called any minute.

932
01:13:46,535 --> 01:13:48,002
Silence!

933
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:52,006
The girls get ready for the first race.

934
01:13:52,074 --> 01:13:54,338
[horn blowing]

935
01:14:00,282 --> 01:14:03,080
l wish l knew
what's happened to them.

936
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:06,383
[crowd murmuring]

937
01:14:06,455 --> 01:14:08,218
[bells jingling]

938
01:14:10,593 --> 01:14:13,960
[woman] Look over there!
Here comes someone now!

939
01:14:16,899 --> 01:14:18,298
Here they come!

940
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:28,839
[man] The girls will take
their starting positions.

941
01:14:28,911 --> 01:14:30,378
That's you, Gretel. Hurry!

942
01:14:30,446 --> 01:14:32,073
Good luck!

943
01:14:33,149 --> 01:14:34,639
- Oh!
- What happened to you?

944
01:14:34,717 --> 01:14:38,118
- l've been to Amsterdam...
- There isn't time. Get ready.

945
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:40,519
Look, they're even better than yours.

946
01:14:40,589 --> 01:14:43,752
When the horn blows,
you will start.

947
01:14:43,826 --> 01:14:49,560
The girls' race is four miles
out to the Zuider Zee and back.

948
01:14:49,632 --> 01:14:53,898
The winner will receive
these silver skates

949
01:14:53,969 --> 01:14:56,733
and 300 guilders.

950
01:14:56,806 --> 01:14:58,831
Good luck to all of you!

951
01:15:03,579 --> 01:15:05,479
[horn blows]

952
01:15:05,548 --> 01:15:07,880
[cheering]

953
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:10,501
[cheering]

954
01:16:38,374 --> 01:16:39,932
Come on! You can do it!

955
01:17:02,398 --> 01:17:04,298
Please don't feel bad about it.

956
01:17:04,366 --> 01:17:05,856
[man] silence!

957
01:17:05,935 --> 01:17:11,271
The winner is Wilhelmina Vooster
of Sparkenburg.

958
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:16,403
- [applause]
- [all] Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

959
01:17:16,478 --> 01:17:19,572
Will you please come forward
and receive your prize?

960
01:17:20,883 --> 01:17:23,147
[crowd murmuring]

961
01:17:29,291 --> 01:17:31,589
[man] The prize.

962
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,529
Never mind.
You nearly won.

963
01:17:39,601 --> 01:17:41,535
Anyway, you still
have a chance.

964
01:17:41,603 --> 01:17:45,539
[man] And now the boys
will take their starting positions.

965
01:17:45,607 --> 01:17:48,804
Go on, Hans.
l'm sure you can win.

966
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,742
Good luck, Hans.

967
01:17:55,217 --> 01:18:00,484
[man] You are about to begin
a long-distance race of 26 miles,

968
01:18:00,556 --> 01:18:04,492
across the Zuider Zee
to Amsterdam and return.

969
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,552
The one we have to worry about
is that fellow from Hoorn.

970
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:10,393
- Which is he?
- The tall one with the fur cap.

971
01:18:10,466 --> 01:18:13,833
They don't call him
Charles the Champion for nothing.

972
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:16,166
l expect every one of you to finish,

973
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:18,001
whether he wins or not.

974
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:19,631
You will start on the horn.

975
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:22,472
After that,
it's every one for himself.

976
01:18:22,544 --> 01:18:24,978
May the best Hollander win.

977
01:18:25,047 --> 01:18:26,537
[whispering]

978
01:18:26,615 --> 01:18:29,914
Oh. lt has been called
to my attention that there is

979
01:18:29,985 --> 01:18:32,977
a dangerous patch of thin ice
in the south basin.

980
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:36,991
So heed the warning and be certain
that you all go around it.

981
01:18:37,059 --> 01:18:38,048
Good luck!

982
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:42,157
[horn blowing]

983
01:18:42,598 --> 01:18:45,533
[cheering]

984
01:18:59,448 --> 01:19:03,179
Even with the best possible speeds,
they won't be back for a long time.

985
01:19:03,252 --> 01:19:05,720
Come. l invite you
to the tavern for a drink.

986
01:19:05,788 --> 01:19:07,221
[all laughing]

987
01:19:36,985 --> 01:19:40,182
[cheering]

988
01:20:22,431 --> 01:20:25,229
- Hurry! Come on!
- Hurry!

989
01:21:05,574 --> 01:21:08,065
Hans! Here l am!

990
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:11,840
Your father is out of danger!

991
01:21:15,884 --> 01:21:19,843
That's it, Henry!
Go, boy, go! Go!

992
01:21:44,813 --> 01:21:46,644
[grunts]

993
01:23:42,531 --> 01:23:44,522

994
01:24:17,232 --> 01:24:19,996
[horn blowing]

995
01:24:40,055 --> 01:24:41,989
l don't see Hans anywhere.

996
01:24:42,057 --> 01:24:45,720
- But Peter is second.
- Come on, Peter!

997
01:25:03,478 --> 01:25:05,969
[loud cheers]

998
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:12,586
[all] Hooray! Hooray!

999
01:25:12,654 --> 01:25:14,747
Hooray!

1000
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,120
- Where's my boy?
- What happened to Hans Brinker?

1001
01:25:21,196 --> 01:25:23,858
They were both behind me
when we left the canal.

1002
01:25:23,932 --> 01:25:27,595
[man] The winner is
Peter Bouman of Volendam.

1003
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:32,003
Will you please come forward
and receive your prize?

1004
01:25:34,609 --> 01:25:38,238
My 20 guilders, if you please.

1005
01:25:45,654 --> 01:25:49,215
l don't understand it.
There must be foul play here somewhere.

1006
01:25:49,291 --> 01:25:51,418
Here they come!

1007
01:25:51,493 --> 01:25:54,155
- [woman] Get a blanket.
- [man] They're hurt?

1008
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:55,890
Something must have happened.

1009
01:26:03,104 --> 01:26:05,129
Hans! Ludwig!

1010
01:26:08,109 --> 01:26:09,974
What happened?

1011
01:26:10,045 --> 01:26:12,206
Peter! You won?

1012
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:17,445
Yeah. But what happened to you?

1013
01:26:17,519 --> 01:26:19,714
- Well, tell us now.
- Out with it.

1014
01:26:24,192 --> 01:26:26,353
lt was all my fault.

1015
01:26:26,428 --> 01:26:29,864
l tried to take a shortcut
across the thin ice,

1016
01:26:29,931 --> 01:26:33,094
and it wouldn't hold me.
Hans pulled me out.

1017
01:26:34,035 --> 01:26:36,367
And what do you have
to say to that?

1018
01:26:36,438 --> 01:26:38,406
l say...

1019
01:26:38,473 --> 01:26:42,637
l say we should both be glad
that our town won.

1020
01:26:42,711 --> 01:26:45,077
Come on, Ludwig.

1021
01:26:48,617 --> 01:26:51,211
l am sorry.

1022
01:26:51,286 --> 01:26:53,481
Thanks for everything
you've done.

1023
01:27:14,809 --> 01:27:18,176
You're recovering quickly,
l don't l have to call on you again.

1024
01:27:18,246 --> 01:27:21,875
- lt's that thick Dutch head of mine.
- [all laugh]

1025
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:24,384
- We can't thank you enough, Doctor.
- No.

1026
01:27:24,452 --> 01:27:27,114
Peter Bouman has offered
to lend us his prize money.

1027
01:27:27,188 --> 01:27:31,056
- So we can pay your fee.
- l warn you. lt's pretty high.

1028
01:27:34,396 --> 01:27:36,091
This is my fee.

1029
01:27:40,802 --> 01:27:43,430
And l won't take anything less.

1030
01:27:43,505 --> 01:27:48,966
A genuine Hans Brinker is going to be
worth a lot of money one of these days.

1031
01:27:49,044 --> 01:27:52,172
By the way, someone has
taken care of your hospital bill.

1032
01:27:52,247 --> 01:27:54,841
- Who was that?
- Mynheer Schimmel

1033
01:27:54,916 --> 01:27:57,885
said it had something to do
with Hans and his son.

1034
01:27:57,953 --> 01:28:00,387
- Well, good day.
- [laughs]

1035
01:28:00,455 --> 01:28:02,218
What's all of this
about money?

1036
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:05,748
Why didn't you use
the thousand guilders l saved?

1037
01:28:07,562 --> 01:28:09,359
Oh, Raff.

1038
01:28:09,431 --> 01:28:12,662
We ransacked the storeroom.
We looked everywhere.

1039
01:28:12,734 --> 01:28:14,395
Somebody must have
stolen it.

1040
01:28:14,469 --> 01:28:18,667
But you didn't look under
the loose board, did you? Huh?

1041
01:28:31,853 --> 01:28:33,081
Oh, Raff.

1042
01:28:33,154 --> 01:28:35,987
Do you call that a safe place
to hide so much money?

1043
01:28:36,057 --> 01:28:38,821
- Anyone could have found it.
- But you didn't, did you?

1044
01:28:38,893 --> 01:28:40,986
No, because it was too easy.

1045
01:28:41,062 --> 01:28:43,553
Oh, you silly man!

1046
01:28:45,233 --> 01:28:47,133
[* accordion playing]

1047
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:50,899
* There's an old sailor song
That we sing all day long

1048
01:28:50,972 --> 01:28:53,566
* And we call it
''The wooden shoe waltz''

1049
01:28:53,642 --> 01:28:57,100
* When we're far out at sea
This gay melody

1050
01:28:57,178 --> 01:28:59,271
* Makes us dream of our sweethearts

1051
01:28:59,347 --> 01:29:01,110
* By the old Zuider Zee

1052
01:29:01,182 --> 01:29:04,413
* Oh, my darling, my darling,
My Hollander miss

1053
01:29:04,486 --> 01:29:07,785
* I'm longing to hug you
And give you a kiss

1054
01:29:07,856 --> 01:29:12,122
* Then whirl you around while
The band plays with schmaltz

1055
01:29:12,193 --> 01:29:15,788
* And dance to the strains of
''The wooden shoe waltz''

1056
01:29:15,864 --> 01:29:17,491
- * Like this
- [taps shoes]

1057
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:19,226
- * Like this
- [taps shoes]

1058
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:22,565
* Then whirl you around
And give you a big kiss

1059
01:29:22,637 --> 01:29:24,332
- * Like this
- [smooching]

1060
01:29:24,406 --> 01:29:26,169
- * Like this
- [smooching]

1061
01:29:26,241 --> 01:29:29,233
* The dance of
''The wooden shoe waltz'' *
