Nearly done, general.

186
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,051
Lieutenant Wuster,
Lieutenant Tanner,

187
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:06,854
sergeant Frank Harper,
all murdered,

188
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:11,125
and all attributed
to Cullen Bohannon,

189
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,396
as enumerated
in Miss Ellison's article.

190
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:17,064
Told you when I took this job
there's a lot of graves

191
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:19,234
- along this railroad, Mr. Ames.
- Yes.

192
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:21,502
But you didn't tell us
that you had murdered these men.

193
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:24,539
Ain't nobody misses 'em.

194
00:11:24,573 --> 00:11:27,508
[Chuckles]
Well, be that as it may,

195
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:31,579
the board is here to ascertain
your character, Mr. Bohannon.

196
00:11:31,614 --> 00:11:35,350
Your impropriety,
your penchant for violence,

197
00:11:35,384 --> 00:11:39,487
your innate lack of judgment
is what's on trial here,

198
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:41,522
as the secretary will attest.

199
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:46,494
For the record, it's his men
done the murdering of my family.

200
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:49,830
General Grant is not
the subject of this inquiry.

201
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:52,400
- Maybe he ought to be.
- [Slams desk]

202
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:55,102
- You're out of order, sir!
- Calm down, senator.

203
00:11:55,137 --> 00:11:57,071
I suggest a ten-minute break
before we call

204
00:11:57,105 --> 00:11:59,707
our first witness, Mr. Chairman.

205
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:01,743
Ten-minute break.
[Gavel bangs]

206
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:10,518
[Applause]

207
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:12,253
Mr. Bohannon.

208
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:13,954
What did you mean when
you said General Grant's men

209
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:17,124
murdered your family?

210
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,393
Look, look, if I'm gonna write
the truth, I'm gonna need your--

211
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:19,960
What truth?

212
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:21,462
Yours, mine, or theirs?

213
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:24,399
The truth.

214
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,668
There's no such thing.

215
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,642
Hand off that pistol.

216
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:38,112
Nod if you understand me.

217
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:43,150
You promised that if

218
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:46,521
I provided you with information,
you'd protect me.

219
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:51,659
I came from nothing.
Did you know that?

220
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:54,762
[Sighs]

221
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:58,466
There is nothing
in my heritage, my people,

222
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,100
where they came from,

223
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:02,903
their place in the world,
to give me even

224
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:08,909
the slightest leg up
on what is to be my destiny.

225
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:11,813
The school of hard knocks
was my teacher.

226
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:13,087
And do you know what I learned?

227
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:15,450
If Mr. Bohannon finds out that

228
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:16,984
- I've been feeding you infor--
- That a man who is encumbered

229
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:18,686
by what's right and what's wrong

230
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:20,287
will never achieve anything.

231
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:22,323
Are you listening to me?

232
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:25,693
I am not encumbered
by what encumbers most men

233
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:29,497
because I am not most men.

234
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:33,468
I thought I saw
the same potential in you.

235
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:36,504
If I was mistaken...

236
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:38,539
you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

237
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:45,012
I will remind you, Miss Ellison,
that you are under

238
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:47,582
a moral obligation
to tell the truth,

239
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:51,719
as you know it, for the benefit
of these proceedings.

240
00:13:51,754 --> 00:13:54,722
I understand.

241
00:13:54,757 --> 00:13:57,692
You have written numerous
articles about Mr. Bohannon

242
00:13:57,726 --> 00:13:59,994
for the <i>New-York Tribune</i>
since your assignment

243
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:03,364
- in Hell on Wheels, haven't you?
- Yes.

244
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,132
You know him well?

245
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,870
I-I don't think anybody
knows him well.

246
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:11,972
Ah, well, keeps to himself,
does he?

247
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:15,910
- That's not what I meant.
- What did you mean?

248
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:21,248
Well, he's not
the chattiest person, and he's--

249
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:23,918
- A bully.
- No, I was going to say--

250
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:26,421
Didn't you write a story
about Mr. Bohannon's decision

251
00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:28,423
to hang the hatch boy?

252
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:29,824
Yes.

253
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:31,526
You described Hell on Wheels

254
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,230
as a Sodom and Gomorrah
of the Nebraska plains,

255
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:39,667
with Mr. Bohannon as its lot.
Hmm.

256
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:41,702
Well, surely you don't condemn
the chief engineer

257
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:44,705
of the Union Pacific
for performing his duty

258
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,742
and punishing the murderer
of his chief of police?

259
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:51,011
You can, and you must,

260
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:52,947
if you're not certain
that the man

261
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:55,416
he lynched committed the crimes
for which he was hung.

262
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:58,619
Are you suggesting
that Mr. Bohannon,

263
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:01,388
in the name of
the Union Pacific,

264
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:03,390
hanged an innocent man?

265
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:08,162
The boy in question was
suspected of the transgression,

266
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:10,397
but no one was able to say,

267
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:13,300
definitively,
that he had done it.

268
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:16,003
I myself thoroughly examined
his skull in the aftermath,

269
00:15:16,037 --> 00:15:19,674
and found nothing to suggest
criminal tendencies.

270
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:23,310
And the boy was, what, 17?

271
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:25,746
And quite devout, I understand.

272
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:27,915
Mr. Bohannon asked me
if I'd had occasion

273
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,818
to know what the Mormons
are like, as a people.

274
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:36,023
How they might react
to being forced off their land.

275
00:15:41,663 --> 00:15:44,231
He asked me if I thought
they would fight.

276
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:47,802
Hmm, sounds like
he wanted to fight.

277
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:51,138
Not a fight.
It was a baby.

278
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:53,674
Along with Mr. Ferguson, sir.

279
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,744
And yet, it was Mr. Bohannon

280
00:15:56,778 --> 00:15:58,412
who gave those young people,

281
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:02,683
your employee and her hapless
suitor, a pistol,

282
00:16:02,718 --> 00:16:07,254
and bullets, and left them
to die in the wilderness.

283
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:09,189
He handed them a gun, yeah.

284
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:13,360
Did you witness
this inhumanity?

285
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:17,999
No, sir, um, but Mr. Bohannon
told me about it, yeah.

286
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:20,801
Ah.

287
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:23,004
- Bragging, no doubt.
- Bullshit.

288
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:24,705
Again, sir,
you're out of order.

289
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,440
Am I the only one who sees
what's going on here?

290
00:16:26,474 --> 00:16:27,808
What, Mr. Bohannon?

291
00:16:27,843 --> 00:16:30,011
A total mis-retelling
of events.

292
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:31,278
Decisions had to be made,

293
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:32,513
it fell to me to make them,

294
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:33,981
the railroad
had to move forward.

295
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:36,651
You're two weeks behind,
are you not?

296
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:38,485
Over the decision you made

297
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,024
not to move camp while you
searched for a whore's baby.

298
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:45,492
Or am I mis-retelling that?

299
00:16:47,596 --> 00:16:51,231
These are complicated issues,
Mr. Bohannon,

300
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:54,401
with serious public
and fiduciary ramifications.

301
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:56,470
And as stockholders
of this company,

302
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:58,706
we have every right
to explore them,

303
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,108
whether you like it or not.

304
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:24,899
Hmm.

305
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:30,504
So you was a soldier, huh?

306
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:32,773
Where'd you fight?

307
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:34,875
I marched with Sherman.

308
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,945
In Mississippi?

321
00:18:49,851 --> 00:18:51,518
Mr. Ferguson...

322
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:54,789
is Mr. Bohannon,
formerly a killer--

323
00:18:54,823 --> 00:18:58,525
uh, pardoned, by law,
for those sins--

324
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,664
still, in your opinion,
capable of killing a man?

325
00:19:07,368 --> 00:19:10,304
I suppose he would kill

326
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:12,506
if another man tried
to kill him.

327
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,509
That was not the question.

328
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:19,013
Have you seen him kill a man?

329
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,420
Yes, or no?

330
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:33,427
Yes.

331
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,932
How recently, Mr. Ferguson?

332
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:46,306
Recent.

333
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:48,342

334
00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:54,215
Eh, no more questions.
Thank you, Mr. Ferguson.

I move we clear the room,
go into executive session,

336

and vote on whether to retain

337
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:04,591

of his position.

338
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:06,861

Let me quote just one item

I believe you will see the value

After what you've been
through today,

you've earned this.

00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:25,679
I'll meet you back
at the train.

You know the problem
with being me?

Can't be no worse
than being me.

Everyone knows I'm a drunk,

561
00:35:59,781 --> 00:36:02,450
and I've been told you can't
make it to the white house

on the back of a pink elephant.

563

You mean you can't drink
in public?

00:36:10,758 --> 00:36:13,560
Shit.

00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:18,099
Well, may be best

It's too late for that.

Well, general...
