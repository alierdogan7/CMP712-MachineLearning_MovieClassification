00:00:02,345 --> 00:00:04,781
<i>Die Spinnen (The Spiders)<i> was
Fritz Lang's third feature film...

2
00:00:04,782 --> 00:00:07,182
and the first to establish his
reputation as one of Germany's...

3
00:00:07,183 --> 00:00:09,483
foremost silent directors.
Lang's work on <i>The Spiders</i>...

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,890
prevented him from directing
the expressionist classic...

5
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:14,337
<i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i>,
a film that had been assigned to him...

6
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:15,538
by producer Erich Pommer.

7
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:17,840
The credits of <i>The Spiders</i>,
however, include several names...

8
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:20,041
famous by <i>Caligari</i>, such
as Set Designer Hermann Warm and...

9
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:22,170
actress Lil Dagover. Filmed in
1919, <i>The Spiders</i> was made...

10
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:24,171
in two parts designed to be shown
on two different theatre dates.

11
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:26,340
Lang's plans to complete
the serial story with a third...

12
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:28,493
and fourth part to be titles
<i>The Secret of the Sphinx</i>
and <i>For Asia's Imperial Crown</i>...

13
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:29,594
were unfortunately
never realized.

14
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:32,363
The film's obsession with
diabolical evil directed by...

15
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:34,464
a powerful but unseen force
is a foreshadowing...

16
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:36,553
of the <i>Dr. Mabuse</i> films
made by Lang three years later...

17
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:38,754
Part of a series of adventure
films in exotic locations...

18
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:40,940
popular in Germany at the time,
<i>The Spiders</i> was a...

19
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,841
boxoffice success and made
Decla the leading German studio.

THE GOLDEN SEA
<i>First Part of "The Spiders"</i>

21
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,980
The message in the bottle.

The Standard Club of
San Francisco...

23
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:26,581
...on the evening before
the great America-Japan Regatta.

24
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,780
Lio Sha.

25
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,780
"Where is Kay Hoog, the favorite
in tomorrow's race?"

26
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:00,500
Kay Hoog.

27
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:16,980
"Kay Hoog lives only for sport.
He's probably forgotten...

28
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,481
...all about tonight's party amid
the preparation for tomorrow's race."

29
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:31,980
"Each of you knows the great
importance of a message in a bottle...

30
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:35,181
It is the last attempt of shipwrecked
sailors to send a message."

31
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,680
"Today as I headed toward shore
aboard my yacht..."

32
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,680
"I hurried home
to open the bottle."

33
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:49,130
<i>To whomever finds this:
Please notify Harvard University...</i>

34
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:51,831
<i>Cambridge Massachusetts,
immediately that I was taken...</i>

35
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:54,180
<i>prisoner here near
the 75th longitude by
descendants of the Incas...</i>

36
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,781
<i>who by tradition still faithfully
offer human sacrifice to the sun.</i>

37
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,680
<i>Unbelievable treasures lie buried
below the ruins of their temples...</i>

38
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:03,481
<i>which are probably inherited
from their old King...</i>

39
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:07,082
<i>Beneath the so-colled "Holy Sea"
extends a gold mine, which
appears to be inexhaustible.</i>

40
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:09,530
<i>Today I escaped my torturers
and made it to the coast...</i>

41
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:12,231
<i>In the name of God, help me.
May 5, 1918.   Fred Johnson.</i>

42
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,780
"I found the point on a map..."

43
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:51,480
"and wired Harvard University
immediately."

44
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,580
"As proof that this mystery
really exists. I have the reply."

45
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:35,380
<i>Professor Johnson
has been missing...</i>

46
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,381
<i>for six months from Peru

00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:15,880
"Consequently, I will not be
in tomorrow's race
for the Golden Trophy...

48
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:19,381
of San Francisco. The golden
treasures of the ancient Incas
are far more inviting."

49
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:38,480
Mouton Rothschild, 1863.

50
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,580
"Good luck, Kay Hoog."

51
00:10:39,194 --> 00:10:41,280
"A broken glass means luck."

52
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,696
That night.

53
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,780
The next morning.

54
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,380
"Do not interfere
with the Spiders' business."

55
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,880
Dr. Telphas.

56
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,880
"The assembly of Spiders
is waiting for you."

57
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:37,980
"Report on our nighttime visit
to Hoog and show the captured
document...

58
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:41,381
Inform the Spiders precisely
of my plans. The golden treasure
must be ours."

59
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,880
"At the Master's order, Lio Sha
has convened this meeting...

60
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:39,881
to inform you
of an important matter."

61
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,080
"The Master wants you to finance
this undertaking immediately...

62
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,481
so that we can get
there ahead of Kay Hoog."

63
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,880
The two expeditions prepare.

64
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,580
"Cuicatlan is the southern-most
station of the South Mexican Railway."

65
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,780
"The line was built by the government
to establish a connection...

66
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,081
to a balloon station where
meteorilogical measurements
are taken."

67
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,080
"I will lead the expedition
myself, and you will
accompany me, Dr. Telphas."

68
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:18,380
On board the scenic car
of the South Mexican Railway.

69
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,280
A telegram arrives for
Harry Rongoon.

70
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:03,080
"Paging Mr. Rongoon! Paging
Mr. Rongoon!"

71
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:14,180
A chance reunion.

72
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:24,980
"I am employed by the meteorological
station in Cuicatlan. I fly
a measurement balloon."

73
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:30,880
"My next mission is a flight
over the Crated Mountains...

74
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:32,581
...of the Cordillares in Chile."

75
00:18:57,697 --> 00:19:00,280
In the bar of Cuicatlan.

76
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:36,980
The Spiders recruit.

77
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,280
"Gentlemen! Twenty dollars per day
and a hundred dollars bonus!"

78
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:19,480
"If you want to go along,
you have to be on time.
I leave at exactly 6 o'clock."

79
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,930
6:02

80
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,280
"Free the balloon!"

81
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,380
The next day,
over the Cordillares.

82
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,480
"This is a document written
in peculiar characters that
I took from the Spiders...

83
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:02,781
in the bar. As much as
I can make out, it is about
a mysterious diamond ship."

84
00:25:13,574 --> 00:25:15,780
The Spiders' expedition.

85
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,380
"It's not enough that we have Kay Hoog
opposing us for the gold treasure...

86
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:27,781
Now he also has the key to our
biggest secret, the diamond ship."

87
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,080
"Where the sun sets in the west...

88
00:25:35,081 --> 00:25:37,381
lies the Holy Sea upon
which no man has ever sailed."

89
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,580
"Every morning in the sun's
first rays there bathes in the sea...

90
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:50,481
the Priestess of the Sun...
a golden woman... Eldora."

91
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,280
75 degrees W. Longitude.

92
00:26:39,424 --> 00:26:41,680
The ruined city
of the old Incas.

93
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:05,180
"If you really want to..."

94
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:58,080
Naela, Priestess of the Sun,
arrives to bathe in the Holy Sea.

95
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,580
Again the great day comes which
occurs every fifty-two suns,
the Great Festival of the Sun."

96
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,780
"We will make a human sacrifice,
so that the race of the Incas...

97
00:29:48,781 --> 00:29:50,781
will again become great and
renew its ancient splendor."

98
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,780
"Flee from here. Save yourself.
Death waits for you here."

99
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,980
"Flee, otherwise you are lost! No white
man has ever left this valley alive."

100
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:33,080
And Kay Hoog saw...

101
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,380
"You will never leave here alive.
In three days is the Great Festival...

102
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:44,381
of the Sun... where your heart
will be sacrificed."

103
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,730
"Tell us how
you took her prisoner..."

104
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,780
"During the nigt I saw smoke rising.
I investigated and saw..."

105
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:40,880
"On the day of the Great Festival
the blood of the prisoners will stain...

106
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:44,181
the sacrificial rock and you. Priestess
of the Sun, will offer the sacrifice."

107
00:34:52,116 --> 00:34:54,480
"I offer flowers which are pure
and white, as sacrifice. But the blood...

108
00:34:54,581 --> 00:34:57,281
of a man? Kill?... Me?
Let there be no sacrifice."

109
00:35:00,436 --> 00:35:02,980
"You must sacrifice them to the sun,
so our people will be great...

110
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:04,881
and powerful.
Again as in time past."

111
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,280
"Flee! Flee!"

112
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:24,780
"I will save you,
as you saved me."

113
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,880
The gold mine
under the Holy Sea.

114
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,980
"The holy candles must not burn.
They bring death."

115
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:34,680
"No one will find us here.
This is the sanctuary of...

116
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:36,781
the Priestess of the Sun,
which none may enter."

117
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,080
An underground waterfall.

118
00:37:32,155 --> 00:37:35,080
"Let me go with you...
far away from here."

119
00:38:22,124 --> 00:38:23,880
And Lio Sha?

120
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,580
"All exits are guarded...
it is impossible to escape."

121
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,180
"Then there is only one way out!
The waterfall must have an outlet..."

122
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,830
"Since her childhood I have trained
Naela for this day. I know how
to force her."

123
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,440
The Sun Festival.

124
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,380
"I will personally come
to get you, that we may make
the sacrifice to the sun."

125
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,780
"O Mighty Sun!"

126
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,680
"Gold! Gold!"

127
00:45:49,148 --> 00:45:51,280
The holy candles are burning.

128
00:46:11,425 --> 00:46:12,980
"Gold! Gold!"

129
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,880
"Come to your senses men!
Everyone will get his share
of the treasure!"

130
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,480
The survivors.

131
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,380
And Kay Hoog...

132
00:50:37,112 --> 00:50:38,680
Afterwards.

133
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,780
Weeks later...
back in San Francisco.

134
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:44,280
"You still have a secret document
of the Spiders. I am here to get it."

135
00:51:47,728 --> 00:51:50,780
"The Diamond Ship document?
It's in good hands."

136
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,080
"We shouldn't be enemies
any longer. You saved my life.
I love you, Kay Hoog."

137
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,780
"There is my heart
and my love."

138
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,581
"Beware Kay Hoog. You have
rejected Lio Sha's love...
now fear her fate."

139
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,780
"I'll be back soon, Naela.
It's urget that I go to the city."

140
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,280
And when Kay Hoog returned...

141
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,680
"Where is Naela?"

142
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,180
"Naela!"

143
00:55:10,234 --> 00:55:11,980
The sign of the Spiders.

144
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,980
"Lio Sha... you will pay
dearly for this!"

145
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:56,180

Hoog and his revenge on Lio Sha...
