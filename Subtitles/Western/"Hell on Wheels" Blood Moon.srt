- It's a norwegian penny.
- Mr. Swede.

I'm Mr. Durant's wife.
You're dangerously behind schedule.

It ain't my fault that you
oversold our mileage.

Did you lay with him?

00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,740
Mickey saw you together!

00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:19,365
Sean, you're scaring me.

10
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,290
Why do you hide your
breeding, Mr. Bohannon?

11
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:24,415
You can't just push me out.

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,340
Mr. Durant offered me a new job

13
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:27,565

Lillian Bell several days ago.

We're trying to

between the corruption
of this railroad

24
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:30,681
and its near total decimation.

they'll replace me.

It's not a matter of explanation.

103

the fortune he'll make.

to know my true self...

her... the more...

You know.

Mr. Bohannon...

00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:06,841
Is that anything that springs up
between you and your woman...

176
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:09,774

00:13:32,807 --> 00:13:36,041
They're always out here
lately at night.

186
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,546
They could slip up and slit
our throats any minute.

187
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,715
So why don't they then?

188
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:45,921
I don't know.

189
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:48,726
But I aim to find out.

190
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,503
I should have known
what they was doin'.

191
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,173
[Fly buzzing]

192
00:14:03,747 --> 00:14:07,716
There's always a reconnoitering
before a battle.

193
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:12,791
Why didn't you send
someone out yourself?

194
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:19,135
Anybody I would've sent out there
wouldn't have come back alive.

195
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:22,104
I couldn't spare the men,

196
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,139
the bridge was almost built.

197
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:27,341
Do you think you were
being shortsighted?

198
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,813
Them some nice shoes.

199
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:37,883
Clean.

200
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:42,685
Think you would've volunteered

201
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,921
to go out and scout a thousand Sioux?

202
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:49,557
[Chatter]

203
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:57,130
You riding out to the bridge?

204
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:59,500
I am.

205
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:02,871
It's quite a milestone for you.

206
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:05,504
It's a milestone for all of us.

207
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,306
Which makes it an ideal time

208
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,075
to talk about your
plans for the future.

209
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,441
Shall we?

210
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:28,526
[Chatter in background]

211
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:51,456
Don't you like New York?

212
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:55,429
I have found it's filled
with women like you.

213
00:15:55,464 --> 00:15:57,064
Ohh.

214
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,234
You think
I'm cruel. Hmm?

215
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:07,075
Tell me... what would
you do in my place?

216
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,314
Thomas will write you
a check and a letter

217
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:15,148
of introduction to a family
that's desperate for a governess.

218
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,081
A governess?

219
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:21,852
Please try and see this
in a positive light.

220
00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:26,390
It's a respectable family...

221
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:29,729
With plenty of marriageable young men.

222
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:38,066
I'm putting a very bright
future in your hands.

223
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:40,803
Yes, you are.

224
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:42,536
Thank you.

225
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,155
Thank you for being the first one
to take her over, Mr. Bohannon.

226
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,481
There were no other
volunteers, skipper.

227
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:59,282
Well, most folks ain't interested

228
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:01,150
in being crushed, boiled, or drowned.

229
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:02,818
Good luck, sir.

230
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:04,221
[Sizzle] Ow.

231
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,955
[Chatter]

232
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:34,414
[Train whistle blowing]

233
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,360
Ah!

234
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,230
[Metal creaking]

235
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:40,334
It's all right, Mr. Durant.

236
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:42,674
It's just the wheels
bearing to the track.

237
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,374
[Metal creaking]

238
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,427
[Chuckles]

239
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:25,193
[Wheels screeching]

240
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:44,309
[Men laughing and cheering]

241
00:19:55,422 --> 00:19:57,459
You did it, ya bastard!

242
00:19:57,494 --> 00:19:58,862
All right, all right, all right.

243
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:00,264
She's not here, Mr. Bohannon.

244
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:03,234
Good job on the
bridge, Mr. Toole.

245
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,369
All right.

246
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,906
Hey, y'all, listen up!

247
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,542
Still got about a day's
work ahead of us.

248
00:20:08,576 --> 00:20:11,080
But there's a round
of drinks on Mr. Durant

249
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:13,083
waiting for you
at the starlight tonight!

250
00:20:13,117 --> 00:20:14,383
Yeah!
All right!

251
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:16,519
Come on, lads!
Back to work!

252
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:19,623
You're welcome.

253
00:20:19,657 --> 00:20:21,459
Don't get cocky.

254
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:23,926
We are still nowhere
near where we need to be.

255
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,860
How far did you
tell the board we were?

256
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:27,195
[Sighs]

257
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:29,131
Leave the men to their work.

258
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:31,299
Whoa. Easy, easy, easy.

259
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:35,642
We need to talk.

260
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,876
You all right,
Mrs. Bell?

261
00:21:36,247 --> 00:21:38,050
Mr. Ferguson.

262
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:42,355
Yes. I'm just
closing the office.

263
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:47,927
Mr. Durant is down
at the bridge site.

264
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:52,196
Can I help you with something?

265
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,799
No, ma'am.

266
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:56,269
You have a good day.

267
00:21:56,303 --> 00:21:57,969
You, too.

268
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:34,948
It'd be nice to have some real walls,

269
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:37,785
keep out the cold, keep you warm.

270
00:22:39,153 --> 00:22:42,152
If your looking for my
husband, he's at work.

271
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,119
I know where he at.

272
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:46,958
Want to have that talk we was
going to have before you left.

273
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:49,562
I've been back a while now,

274
00:22:49,596 --> 00:22:51,330
how come this is the first
time you showed up?

275
00:22:51,364 --> 00:22:53,834
I got a surprise for you.

276
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:57,806
Surprises ain't been
good in my experience.

277
00:22:57,841 --> 00:22:59,275
This one is good.

278
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,312
For you and the baby.

279
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:05,652
You don't got to worry
about the baby no more.

280
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:09,423
Why you say that?

281
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:12,928
Because it's between me
and my husband now.

282
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:16,030
He's got a future on this railroad.

283
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:18,100
I heard you quit.

284
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,905
I'm on my own now.

285
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,576
I built us a house down by the river.

286
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:37,082
Fresh water, land...

287
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:39,520
Place where the baby can grow up.

288
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:45,060
A good solid floor and freedom...

289
00:23:46,495 --> 00:23:48,995
A fireplace that ain't that smoky.

290
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,264
Stop it.

291
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:52,668
All our love can live there.

292
00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:54,035
Can you stop it?

293
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:55,968
That ain't real.

294
00:23:56,003 --> 00:23:57,302
Yeah, it is.

295
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,436
No, it ain't.

296
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,536
And I got to pretend
that that don't exist.

297
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:06,407
Come on. Come on.

298
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:08,906
No, I got mending to do.

299
00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:13,481
Mr. Toole would be real angry
if he knew you were here.

300
00:24:13,516 --> 00:24:16,450
You should probably go.

301
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:43,184
How would you like
to be a very rich man?

302
00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:46,085
Seen a lot of rich men
end up in shallow graves.

303
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,921
When the board arrives, they will see
that I have misled the government

304
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,323
on their behalf. [Sighs]

305
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,992
They will move against me.

306
00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:57,998
They may even try
to have me imprisoned.

307
00:24:58,032 --> 00:25:03,105
The railroad will likely fail and,
well, you'll be out of a job.

308
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:05,508
I've been in worse spots.

309
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:10,514
I am offering you
a full partnership...

310
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:14,648
If you will help me convince them

311
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:17,150
that everything we have
done has been necessary.

312
00:25:25,695 --> 00:25:27,631
Now, why would they believe me?

313
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:32,502
You are an interesting
anomaly, Mr. Bohannon.

314
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:35,104
A gunslinger and an aristocrat.

315
00:25:35,138 --> 00:25:36,405
[Chuckles]

316
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:38,839
Yeah, wouldn't go that
far in either direction.

317
00:25:38,874 --> 00:25:42,408
Look, I am unwell.

318
00:25:42,443 --> 00:25:44,846
I simply need you to back me up.

319
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,680
What if they don't believe me?

320
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:52,422
Well, there's a good chance that
you will share in the blame.

321
00:25:52,456 --> 00:25:54,425
And a jail cell.

322
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,061
From the moment you accept my offer,

323
00:25:57,096 --> 00:26:00,666
all your debts owing to me
will be forgiven.

324
00:26:05,906 --> 00:26:09,443
All my debts to you were
buried with Doc Whitehead.

325
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,167
Sign the check.

326
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:35,104
[Sighs] I know her.

327
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:38,341
She will not leave the railroad.

328
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:41,780
This is the best way
for us to be rid of her.

329
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:43,081
Is it?

330
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:46,816
Have you done something
you haven't told me about?

331
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:53,519
I will do this my way
if your way fails.

332
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:55,555
Your way.

333
00:26:56,925 --> 00:27:01,028
As long as there's no mess.
Do you assure me?

334
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,466
I'll sign the check...

335
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,738
And then her fate will be
briefly in her hands...

336
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,441
Before it's in mine.

337
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:24,892
[Sighs]

338
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:38,139
Mr. Durant has offered me a
permanent place with the railroad.

339
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:41,474
[Chuckles] He, uh...

340
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:43,575
He offered me a partnership.

341
00:27:43,609 --> 00:27:46,576
Then it must be your
job he's offering me.

342
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:48,778
[Horses approaching]

343
00:27:51,112 --> 00:27:52,747
Whoa, whoa.

344
00:27:52,781 --> 00:27:56,620
It's one of our horses. Shit.

345
00:28:02,695 --> 00:28:06,498
It's too dangerous
for you to be out here now.

346
00:28:17,111 --> 00:28:19,779
I've been thinking
about what you said.

347
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:24,183
About all you have
is your job... and me.

348
00:28:24,217 --> 00:28:27,320
All I have is this railroad and you.

349
00:28:27,354 --> 00:28:29,522
We can build it together.

350
00:28:29,556 --> 00:28:31,456
We already are.

351
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,225
Everything...

352
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,730
Everything to remove the
Durants is in this ledger.

353
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:40,534
False mileage, skimming
profits, the whole lot.

354
00:28:40,568 --> 00:28:42,839
We can do this.

355
00:28:45,011 --> 00:28:46,379
Hey, no!

356
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:47,813
Wait!

357
00:28:47,846 --> 00:28:49,346
Burning it before Durant finds
out and has you killed.

358
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:51,482
I guaran-damn-tee he's
already thought about it.

359
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:55,054
How do you know?

360
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:57,887
Like he said,

361
00:28:57,922 --> 00:29:01,058
me and him's different
sides of the same coin.

362
00:29:01,093 --> 00:29:04,293
Mr. Bohannon!

363
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,093

[Horses neighing]

367
00:29:13,863 --> 00:29:15,763
It's just an Indian.

368
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,531
I don't know, sir...

371
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,737
Mr. Bohannon!

372
00:29:26,772 --> 00:29:28,238
Bring the lantern.

373
00:29:28,272 --> 00:29:29,705
Up there?

374
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:46,184
Shine that light over here.

375

Nicked him.

376
00:29:57,225 --> 00:29:59,826
Go on back to camp with Toole.

377

Lily... burn that book.

378
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:50,729
Would you keep this for me,

379
00:30:50,763 --> 00:30:54,765
and ship it back east...

380
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,469
Ship it back east
if something happens?

381
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:00,776
What kind of happen?

382
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:07,750
In case I am killed,
Mr. Ferguson.

383
00:31:10,757 --> 00:31:12,690
Why not?

384
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:15,928
If a white woman dies and
a black man in the stew,

385
00:31:15,962 --> 00:31:17,198

386
00:31:17,232 --> 00:31:19,498
I'm just asking you to keep it.

387
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:21,233
And I'm just saying no.

388
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:23,537
What have I done to offend you?

389
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:31,146
Please? Please?

390
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,886
Get on from here.
You on my property.

391
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:54,009
This is for Eva.

392
00:31:57,481 --> 00:31:59,816
It's beautiful.

393
00:32:04,118 --> 00:32:06,381
Give me the damn package.

394
00:32:08,952 --> 00:32:11,119

Where did you see the white spirit?

00:32:45,953 --> 00:32:49,856
Down at the gorge.
What's it mean?

399
00:32:55,961 --> 00:32:58,763
The Sioux nation
wants everyone here to die.

400
00:32:58,797 --> 00:33:00,698
When?

401
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:04,170
Soon.

402
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:07,972
It'll be a blood bath.

403

I don't care what happens
to anyone here... but Ruth.

404
00:33:14,814 --> 00:33:16,915
No offense taken.

405
00:33:18,817 --> 00:33:21,153
You've changed,
Mr. Bohannon.

406
00:33:21,188 --> 00:33:25,192
Yeah? I'd say it's you.
Take me out there.

407
00:33:28,497 --> 00:33:32,033
If they catch us...
They'll kill you.

408
00:33:33,436 --> 00:33:36,203
Take me out there right now.

409
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,862
You wanted to see me?

410
00:34:06,407 --> 00:34:08,674
It's your take from the saloon.

411
00:34:09,943 --> 00:34:11,742
You were holding out on me.

412
00:34:11,777 --> 00:34:13,043
That's for your own good.

413

Against the church...

414
00:34:16,845 --> 00:34:19,681
Word is you've separated
from her, yeah?

415
00:34:19,716 --> 00:34:22,384
Actually, we're closer than ever.

416
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:24,284
She'll never convert to the faith.

417
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:26,586
I'm going to convert to hers.

418
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:30,221
Would you listen to yourself?

419
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:32,322
She's infected your mind.

420
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:33,990
I thought it through.

421
00:34:34,024 --> 00:34:35,559
That'd kill mum.

422
00:34:35,593 --> 00:34:37,929
You'll burn in hell, Sean.

423
00:34:37,964 --> 00:34:41,328
You're forever cast
in the lake of fire.

It's in the Bible.

I came to America to build

427
00:34:47,234 --> 00:34:50,801
a life in this world, not the next.

428
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:55,142
Then I'll have to disown you.

429
00:34:59,577 --> 00:35:01,780
Whew.

430
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,921
Do you know who I am?

431
00:35:07,754 --> 00:35:09,788

I'm his brother.

00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,627
I'd be that baby's Uncle.

434
00:35:15,028 --> 00:35:17,760
I appreciate your thoughts,

435
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:20,727
but I'm Mrs. Toole
and this is his baby.

436
00:35:20,762 --> 00:35:22,530
If that how you see it,

437
00:35:22,565 --> 00:35:24,401
then you need to talk to Elam,

438

'cause his heart is tearing all apart.

the gathering of tribes.

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,336
What's a blood moon?

442
00:35:54,371 --> 00:35:57,639
It's a time for bloodletting...

443
00:35:57,673 --> 00:35:59,374
The settling of scores.

444
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,677

445
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:04,380

I want you to come and tell Durant,

448
00:36:24,363 --> 00:36:27,130
so he don't think I'm crazy.

449
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:31,869
You'll never see me again.

450
00:36:37,376 --> 00:36:41,810
What did you do after you
discovered the Sioux threat?

451
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:48,083
Telegraphed the fort
and asked for soldiers.

452
00:36:48,117 --> 00:36:50,416
We sent men and weapons.

453
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:55,185
Yeah, five recruits and a small cannon.
Much obliged.

454
00:37:02,661 --> 00:37:07,367
Baptism is a sacramental
cleansing of a life.

455

Do you understand that?

456
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,405
Of course.

457
00:37:19,714 --> 00:37:24,785
You affirm your love
of God above all things.

459
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:30,950

This is serious, Sean.

You're going to have to
renounce your faith.

462
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:45,220
You're going to have
to give up your saloon,

the pleasure house...
And?

464
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:49,292
And...

465
00:37:50,326 --> 00:37:54,864
I just can't believe
you're going to do that.

466
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:58,803
Doesn't your church compel you

467
00:37:58,837 --> 00:38:01,103
to baptize anyone who asks?

468
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:06,607
If you are sincere, Sean.

469
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:10,573
Does your God allow you
to deny me access to him?

470
00:38:12,978 --> 00:38:15,213
Of course not.

471
00:38:15,247 --> 00:38:16,647
Well...

472
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,460
To the river then.

00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:10,449
Is it that ugly?

474
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:15,386
No... it's beautiful.

475
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:18,526
I knew you'd come
around once you saw it...

476
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,461
And saw that I was serious.

477
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:24,795

provider, and, uh...

what you think.

Steady, Mr. Ferguson!

499
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:48,689
I thought we were on our way.

500

We are.

501

for what...
I thought it was you.

as wide as the sky.

00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:06,107
No. I came to tell him that it's
over between us, I swear it.

506
00:41:06,141 --> 00:41:07,408
I love you, Eva, and you made me think

507

that you loved me
just a little bit, as well.

00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:12,412

forces of wickedness,

519

reject the evil powers of this world,

520
00:42:41,738 --> 00:42:44,305
and repent of your sin?

521
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,410
I do.

522
00:42:47,444 --> 00:42:50,182
Do you accept the freedom and power

God gives you to resist evil

and oppression in whatever
forms they present themselves?

525
00:42:57,527 --> 00:42:59,897
I do.

526
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:04,568
Do you confess Jesus
Christ as your savior

527
00:43:04,603 --> 00:43:09,441
and promise to serve him as your lord?

528
00:43:09,475 --> 00:43:11,711
I do.

546
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,737
I thought the lord was going to
send the angel Gabriel himself

547
00:45:01,772 --> 00:45:02,938
to strike me blind.

548
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:07,076
Well, thankfully, that didn't happen.

549
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:21,855
Ohh.

550
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:25,691
Sean.

551
00:45:28,394 --> 00:45:30,664
Sean, stop!

552
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:47,846
Good day, Mr. Durant.

553
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:51,488
I thought we had
an agreement, Mr. Ferguson.

554
00:45:53,057 --> 00:45:54,856
This job you need doing...

555
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:57,056
Cold feet, hmm?

556
00:45:57,091 --> 00:45:59,191
I would've thought...

557
00:45:59,226 --> 00:46:05,663
That you would want to keep your
land, your house, your future...

558
00:46:05,697 --> 00:46:08,230
You said after the bridge...

559
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,133
The bridge is complete.

560
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,735
It's time, Mr. Ferguson.

561
00:46:20,704 --> 00:46:23,402
Good boy. Good boy.

"I'm afraid we can't
accommodate you at this time."

This is some kind of bullshit.

This is the world we live in.

571
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:03,398
We cannot panic every time
somebody sees an Indian

572

and bring the work to a halt.

573
00:47:05,335 --> 00:47:06,669
Well, guess what? The
men are already spooked.

Damn it!

00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:13,340

Mr. Ferguson.

Sit down.

581
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:51,449
Did you change your mind
about sending it?

I'm gonna be shipping
it in the morning.

You're here to kill me.

00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:13,439
Mr. Durant
promised me my land

587
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,573
and my house down on the river.

588
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:27,189
My life is worth only a few
acres of river bottom.

589
00:48:27,224 --> 00:48:29,424
It's a nice spot.

590
00:48:32,094 --> 00:48:34,395
How are you going to do it?

591
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:36,896
Strangle or cut.

592
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,562
Probably cut.

593
00:48:57,346 --> 00:49:00,079
You got a reason for me not to?

I don't think you're the person

the Durants think you are.

596

came to see me last night.

Ah.

615
00:51:21,252 --> 00:51:26,024
Well, you had your chance, Lily.

616
00:51:26,058 --> 00:51:29,230
We asked you to leave town nicely.

617
00:51:32,734 --> 00:51:35,403
I told you already, Thomas.

618
00:51:35,438 --> 00:51:37,241

00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:43,816
You betrayed me to Bohannon
over pillow talk.

621
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:48,220
So you decided to have me killed.

622
00:51:48,254 --> 00:51:50,256
It's vulgar, Thomas.

I have borne every privation
for this railroad!

another human being,

the hands of your wife...

629

I've even endured your bed!

00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:11,117
That, Lily, makes you a whore.

631
00:52:12,553 --> 00:52:16,156
[Sighs] Know then that
when your precious railroad

632
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:18,525
is ripped from your thick
and grasping fingers

633
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,327
that you've been undone by a whore.

634
00:52:20,361 --> 00:52:22,196
Why?

635
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,767
What have you done?

636
00:52:27,003 --> 00:52:31,170
I'll leave you to your work.

638

I was their white spirit...

639
00:52:41,982 --> 00:52:45,457
They stretched me on the ground

640
00:52:45,491 --> 00:52:50,559
and they built
small fires upon my body.

I should never have turned
to the... the heathens.

You should never have lost
your place in this town.

I have...
I have missed you...

Shh.

650
00:53:21,091 --> 00:53:22,557
I'm here now.

[Cocks gun] Wait!

653
00:53:29,066 --> 00:53:31,568

Yeah. When's
that going to be?

00:53:44,353 --> 00:53:46,486
Tomorrow night.

Oh, God!

659
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:01,167
There's no need for
that, Mr. Bohannon.

660
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:02,769
Look at him.

661
00:54:02,803 --> 00:54:04,269
I doubt he's even going to
make it through the night.

662
00:54:04,303 --> 00:54:06,737
Friend of yours or not,

663
00:54:06,771 --> 00:54:08,839
he's going to hang for
sabotaging the railroad.

00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:10,408
I'm putting a guard on him.

Stop! This is not the way.

Stop!

672
00:54:36,368 --> 00:54:38,336
You will not kill
another man in a rage,

673
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:40,205
I won't have Durant's
blood on my hands.

674
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:41,538
Then why the hell did you tell me?

675
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:44,872
To prove to you finally
that he has to go.

676
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:48,213
But not this way.

677
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:51,347
You and I can build
this railroad together.

678
00:54:51,382 --> 00:54:54,185
I've already shipped the ledger.

679
00:54:54,219 --> 00:54:56,921
But the board won't
take a woman seriously.

680
00:54:56,955 --> 00:54:59,290
I can't do this without you.

681
00:55:03,727 --> 00:55:07,129
And you...

00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:13,901
You're better with me, aren't you?

683
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:17,701
Yeah.

684
00:55:18,903 --> 00:55:21,205
I am.

685
00:55:23,711 --> 00:55:27,946
I want you on the first
railcar out of here.

686
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,080
You ain't gonna be on it, is you?

687
00:55:30,114 --> 00:55:31,450
No.

688
00:55:31,484 --> 00:55:33,616
Thought so.

00:55:35,584 --> 00:55:37,382
Protect our bridge.

690
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:41,589
I'll be here waiting for
you when you get back.

691
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:07,681
You know how to work a cannon?

692
00:56:07,715 --> 00:56:09,785
Cannon?

693
00:56:09,819 --> 00:56:12,221
I seen plenty cannon work.

694
00:56:12,256 --> 00:56:15,091
You really got one?

695
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:18,396
Mount up, this ain't no place to die.

696
00:56:25,905 --> 00:56:28,340
Thanks for not killin' my lady friend.

697
00:56:28,374 --> 00:56:30,008
You welcome.

698
00:56:30,043 --> 00:56:31,877
Gotta ask you though.

699
00:56:31,911 --> 00:56:34,447
Was you ever gonna do it?

700
00:56:34,481 --> 00:56:36,749
You know your Bible?

701
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:39,684
Some.

702
00:56:39,718 --> 00:56:41,817
You know when the angel came down,

703
00:56:41,851 --> 00:56:45,920
grab a hold of Abraham's arm right
before he cut Isaac's neck?

704
00:56:45,954 --> 00:56:47,288
Yeah?

705
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:49,157
It won't like that.

706
00:56:49,192 --> 00:56:52,894
Almost got my ass shot.

707
00:56:54,229 --> 00:56:57,363
She ain't a woman to be messed with.

708
00:56:57,398 --> 00:56:59,065
True.

709
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:00,532
True, she ain't.

710
00:57:00,566 --> 00:57:03,101
Hmm. Let's do it.

[Clicking]

712
00:57:05,271 --> 00:57:06,256
Ahh.

713
00:57:27,317 --> 00:57:30,786
If I could have a quiet word, please.

715
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:59,623
My personal ledgers...
How damning are they?

716
00:57:59,657 --> 00:58:05,966
You ask because
you have lost them, hmm?

717
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,569
How damning?

718
00:58:08,603 --> 00:58:14,111
How far you are falling, min herrdome.

719
00:58:14,146 --> 00:58:21,750
You may fall through
the floor into hell itself.

[Gasping]

721
00:58:23,853 --> 00:58:30,628
At least a prison in upstate New York.

722
00:58:30,663 --> 00:58:34,366
What am I going to do?

723
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:40,832
You are suffering...
That is good!

724
00:58:40,867 --> 00:58:45,238
Suffering builds character.

725
00:58:45,273 --> 00:58:50,609
You will need that during
your incarceration.

726
00:58:50,643 --> 00:58:51,978
I will die in prison.

727
00:58:52,013 --> 00:58:57,449

01:14:17,013 --> 01:14:19,450
No! No! No!

916
01:14:19,484 --> 01:14:23,322
Aah! Aah!

917
01:14:29,361 --> 01:14:33,095
No! No!

918
01:14:34,532 --> 01:14:37,735
No! Please! Please!

919
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:38,902
No!

920
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:40,936
Shh. I will be quick.

921
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:42,238
I was kind to you.

922
01:14:42,272 --> 01:14:46,079
Yes, you was.

923
01:14:46,113 --> 01:14:48,548
I thank you.

924
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:54,524
Cullen will kill you.

925
01:14:54,558 --> 01:14:56,928
Yes...

926
01:14:56,962 --> 01:15:00,232
For this is all for him.

927
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:04,202
No! No!

928
01:15:04,236 --> 01:15:07,004
Oh!

929
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:15,711
Aah!

930
01:15:51,304 --> 01:15:56,166
How was it you decided
to defend the bridge and not the town?

931
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:59,688
I learned in the war
to protect strategic assets.

932
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:01,422
The town.

933
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:03,990
The town ain't nothing but
wood and canvas, replaceable.

934
01:16:04,024 --> 01:16:06,794
And its inhabitants?

935
01:16:09,266 --> 01:16:11,401

Ah. A beautiful
bridge, Mr. Bohannon.

970
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:27,287
An enduring monument to
the vision of Mrs. Lily Bell...

971
01:20:30,805 --> 01:20:33,994
And your own myopic
single-mindedness.

972
01:20:34,342 --> 01:20:35,707
[chuckles]

973
01:20:35,827 --> 01:20:39,020
I was surprised that
you made it

974
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:41,192
so easy

975
01:20:41,769 --> 01:20:44,052
to take her from you.

976
01:20:46,924 --> 01:20:48,203
Thank you.

977
01:20:48,947 --> 01:20:50,386
It was, uh...

978
01:20:51,267 --> 01:20:53,563
inexplicably pleasurable...

979
01:20:59,819 --> 01:21:02,425
Not as much as it'll
be to see you swing.

980
01:21:04,188 --> 01:21:05,503
You evil son of a bitch.

981
01:21:05,838 --> 01:21:08,593
Regrettably not, Mr. Bohannon...

982
01:21:08,713 --> 01:21:09,869
[chuckles]

983
01:21:10,874 --> 01:21:13,902
...for you and I are now...

984
01:21:16,011 --> 01:21:17,761
consumated.

985
01:21:19,425 --> 01:21:20,841
Are we not?

986
01:21:26,721 --> 01:21:28,098
Adieu to you!

987
01:21:28,218 --> 01:21:29,649
Good day!

988
01:21:32,074 --> 01:21:33,274
Whoa!

989
01:22:08,724 --> 01:22:10,962
Mr. Bohannon...

990
01:22:12,362 --> 01:22:15,627
It's gonna take some time
to sort this all out.

991
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,921
Meanwhile, the President
of the United States

992
01:22:19,946 --> 01:22:23,046
has ordered the construction
of the railroad to continue.

993
01:22:24,969 --> 01:22:30,249
Would you entertain in assuming
Mr. Durant's role and leading us westward?

994
01:22:36,803 --> 01:22:38,218
Mr. Bohannon...

995
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,821
will you finish this road?

996
