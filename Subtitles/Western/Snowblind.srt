1
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,240
In the year 1968, an ice age gripped the earth.

2
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,200
World economy stalled and governments fell, 
leaving entire civilisations in ruin.

3
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,960
In the ensuing years of merciless cold, millions perished.

4
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,365
But humanity prevailed.

5
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,560
Humankind evolved, people's bodies adapted.

6
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,805
Their minds did not.  

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,960
 Man remained a savage animal.

8
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,120
Chapter 1:  
 There Will Be Blood.

9
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,640
Gimme some water, Jack!

10
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,560
What for?

11
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,040
In less than an hour, they'll burn you to ashes.

12
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,480
And believe me, nothing's gonna stop your mouth from becoming dry.

13
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,720
You're getting excited, Jack!  
 - Not hardly.

14
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,720
I've seen ordinary scum like you every day.

15
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,240
- So that's why you're personally watching me?

16
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,240
What did you want - water?  
 - Yeah.

17
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,120
They're ready.

18
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,080
Back off! Way off!

19
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,360
Careful, boy!

20
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,440
Move it! Move!

21
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,560
Men! Today I give you the pleasure, of turning this,

22
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,800
scumbag of an outlaw

23
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,560
into a hunk of meat.  
 Once upon a time a great gunfighter,

24
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,840
who was brought to his knees by a slut, a common whore!

25
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,040
Any last words of wisdom you would like to share with us?

26
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,680
Yeah. If you have the opportunity to shoot somebody -  
 shoot, and don't speak.

27
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,800
Men!

28
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,840
Ready your arms!

29
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,480
Aim!

30
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,000
F - - -  
 - Don't fire!

31
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,480
Guns down!  
 - What?!?

32
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
Guns down!

33
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,240
Mister Young is with us now.  
 - Are you crazy?

34
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,520
I will report you to the Governor!  
 - Feel free to join us upstairs.

35
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,200
The Governor is here?

36
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,720
Come in Mister Young.

37
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,640
Who invited you to the party?

38
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,400
I'm just here to give you a little going away present.

39
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,280
 
 - Looks more like a "welcome back" present.

40
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,720
Who do I have to kill?

41
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,880
Matthew Saberneck.  
 - Is he really too much for all your little boys?

42
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,080
My organisation doesn't rely on mere Manpower.

43
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,560
My biggest weapon is information.

44
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,280
By combining logic with seamless data,

45
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,240
the outcome of all things can be predicted.

46
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,480
The fact that you are standing here in front of me  
 right now, is proof of my methods.

47
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,120
Uh-huh.

48
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,080
Seems to me that Saberneck's death is worth a little  
 bit more than just my life.

49
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:12,080
I must confess, from what I've seen so far,  
 I'm not convinced of your legendary status.

50
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,880
I'm sorry to put you to the test Mister Young.

51
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,400
But a legend is not valid fact.

52
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,120
It is made up of myth, word of mouth and exaggerations.

53
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,040
That's why I came here -  
 I need valid facts to run my organisation.

54
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,480
Regarding your concerns about mister Saberneck's life...

55
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,640
maybe a little silver could make up the difference?

56
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,480
500 now, and 5000 when you get the job done.

57
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,800
I thought he worked for you.  
 - He did.

58
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,480
Didn't work out, huh?

59
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,400
I think Jack needs some water.

60
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,520
His ranch is behind a small town called China.

61
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,720
Just drive out to Liberty and continue south-west.

62
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,480
You'll find it right there behind some hot springs.

63
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,200
And Mister Young...  
 I believe you'll be requiring this.

64
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,040
And don't forget Mister Young:  
 I have my people everywhere.

65
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,280
I'll be in your office in Liberty in three days.

66
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,360
Have my money ready.

67
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,880
You didn't say anything about HER?

68
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,280
Clayton Young isn't one of your men, Marshal.

69
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,400
He would never kill a woman.

70
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,720
Chapter 2:  
 Lady In The Water

71
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,200
Does Matthew Saberneck live around here?

72
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,280
Who wants to know?  
 - The name's Clayton Young.

73
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,720
I'm an old friend.  
 - Just down the road.

74
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,200
You Matthew Saberneck?  
 - Come forth!

75
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,440
That's enough!

76
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,480
Put your hands up, Mister Young!

77
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,560
Now get off the bike.

78
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,200
Take off your gun!

79
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,440
I don't take off my gun for anyone.  
 - Take it off, or I'll take you off at the neck!

80
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,160
Other hand!

81
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,800
Lay that thing down.

82
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,160
Now come on over here so I can watch you!

83
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,000
You're pretty careful!  
 - Yup.

84
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,840
How do you know who I am?  
 - What are you doing 'round these parts?

85
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,040
Just passin' through.

86
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,440
Can I put my hands down now?

87
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,360
Nice place.  
 - Now what do you want?

88
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,480
Truth be told... I'm leaving these parts for good.

89
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,960
And I just wanted to see the last great gunfighter  
 in person before I go.

90
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,160
You mean, I'm gonna be number one again?

91
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,720
Alright....

92
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,280
C'mon, let's go wet our tonsils!

93
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,200
You know, I'd kill any other man who took my guns from me.  
 - I know.

94
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,040
Chapter 3:  
 Lion's Den

95
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,240
Yeah well you know, one of my biggest mistakes was  
 to let Charles Renardo draw first on me.

96
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,520
Hell, I don't even remember what we were arguing about...

97
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,480
Say...  
 When'd you find your interest in farming?

98
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,645
Farming? ME?!?  

99
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,840
Farming? ME?!?  
 Well actually I'm not THAT interested in farming...

100
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,960
Hi! Just been thinking about you!

101
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,560
This is Naina, my wife.

102
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,440
This is Clayton Young, Clayton will be staying for dinner.

103
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,965
An old friend of yours.  

104
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,560
An old friend of yours.  
 No, actually we just met.

105
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,485
I see.

106
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,480
Pleased to meet you.

107
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,680
You know, sorta on accounta her...

108
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,400
I pretty much changed my whole way of life.

109
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,320
She's still not happy.

110
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,640
Keeps talking 'bout her family back east.

111
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,800
What about you?  
 - I figured I'd head down to the southern sands.

112
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,200
Oh, joinin' the search for paradise!

113
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,160
Well good luck.  
 - Matt?

114
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,120
If the gentleman's staying for dinner,  
 you want to kill a rabbit?

115
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Yeah, sure.

116
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,525
Wanna wash up?  

117
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,280
Wanna wash up?  
 - Yeah.

118
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,405
Quiet out here.  

119
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,760
Quiet out here.  
 - Yeah well I've had enough excitement for one lifetime.

120
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,565
Just one fight left ahead of me.  

121
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,640
Just one fight left ahead of me.  
 - With whom?

122
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,200
The Governor seems to think I stole from him.

123
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,240
That's the first time I hear you being called a thief.

124
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,360
So what's this really about?

125
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,600
Are you coming to bed, Matthew?  
 - Get in the house, woman!

126
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,480
Ain't you got no shame?

127
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,560
She's used to being alone out here  
 with me all the time...

128
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,840
Listen I'm sorry, all I got to offer you is the barn.

129
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,965
The barn's better than what I've had the last couple days...  

130
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,080
The barn's better than what I've had the last couple days...  
 - Good enough.

131
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,640
Yeah it's been a real nice evening, I enjoyed your company.

132
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,560
You have a good night.  
 - Good night.

133
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Night, see you in the morning.

134
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,480
Who's Mister Young?

135
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,885
He's a gunfighter.

136
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,165
Probably the best around.  

137
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,000
Probably the best around.  
 - Even better than you?

138
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,640
He's come to kill me Naina.

139
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,845
Sent by the Governor.  

140
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,600
Sent by the Governor.  
 - Then why are you letting him stay?

141
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:38,440
Because... If he's ready, it don't make no sense to hide.

142
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,000
Tomorrow I'm gonna take him to the woods to find out.

143
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,160
Morning! Sleep well?

144
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,280
Like a log.

145
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,640
Sorry, seems I'm getting a little jumpy in my old age.

146
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,960
You're still pretty fast.

147
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,005
I never was that good with a hand gun...  

148
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,280
I never was that good with a hand gun...  
 Come on, I set us up some breakfast.

149
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,040
I'll clean up and be right there.

150
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,320
Chapter 4:  
 Hunted Hunter

151
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,200
You're pretty calm,  
 knowing the Governor is coming after you.

152
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,200
I never did learn how to run.

153
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,840
Besides, this is my land...

154
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,360
I ain't gonna budge for him!

155
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,480
What about her? Ain't he gonna kill her too?

156
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,480
No. It's her he's after.

157
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,880
But I'm not gonna make it easy for him.

158
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,600
I used to work for that sunovabitch.

159
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,880
'Bout five years ago, I had to kill a whole family.

160
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,120
Right down to their cats, and their dogs, and their chickens.

161
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,160
Guess it's my turn now.

162
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,845
You sure do take care of that cannon.  

163
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,400
You sure do take care of that cannon.  
 - Oh yeah. Heh.

164
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,800
It's been a good ol' gun for me...

165
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,280
Damn thing'll take your arm off at a mile.

166
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,160
I can see now why you feel more like the hunter  
 than the hunted.

167
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,440
Yeah.

168
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,360
Well. Let's go bag us some dinner!

169
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,480
I think I smell a rabbit!

170
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,080
You go down that way, send it up to me...  
 I'll be waitin' over there!

171
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,320
No need for me to have a gun, right?

172
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,680
Smart boy. Now get movin'!

173
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,085
Hold it right there!  

174
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,880
Hold it right there!  
 Matt! I've got that sunovabitch!

175
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,240
Gimme the gun before I blow your brains out!

176
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:12,840
This is Virgil, Mr Young... One of my former students.

177
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,880
And this... this is Duke!

178
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,805
This ain't what it looks like.  

179
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,200
This ain't what it looks like.  
 - It sure is.

180
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,960
If you have to shoot somebody Mr Young, you shoot me.

181
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,360
He's one of the Governor's!

182
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,960
I had just lost him there for a second!

183
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,880
Now hold on there boys!

184
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,760
How come you didn't tell me 'bout this gun?

185
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,245
Like I told ya...  

186
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,800
Like I told ya...  
 I'd have to kill any man who took my guns from me!

187
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,480
So he did.

188
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,360
Chapter 5:  
 Heartbreak Kids

189
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,360
Come on Clayton, I want you to  
 meet the rest of my little family.

190
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,285
This is Johnny...  

191
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,640
This is Johnny...  
 - And you're Clayton Young?

192
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:28,400
He sure as hell is!

193
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,120
This young woman here is Barbara...  
 there's no one better with a blade.

194
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,760
Nice to meet you.

195
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,360
And this here... is Virgil Junior!

196
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,160
How a man knows, what's inside a woman's stomach, 
 I'll never understand.

197
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,165
It's simple, he put it there, that's how!  

198
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,080
It's simple, he put it there, that's how!  
 Hey young man, you keep those remarks to yourself.

199
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,600
Right. Like you'd know anything about that.

200
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:56,160
Wait a minute you two, don't start that.  
 Come on Clayton, let's go have a drink.

201
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,400
Sit down.

202
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,000
So you taught those kids?

203
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,240
Not the singing part.

204
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,400
Oh yes. Barbara!

205
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,960
The Governor wanted me to make my own unit.

206
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,925
So he had their parents killed, and brought'em to me.  

207
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,640
So he had their parents killed, and brought'em to me.  
 I couldn't leave 'em.

208
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,485
Anything wrong?  

209
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,040
Anything wrong?  
 - No.

210
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,440
Just getting ready.

211
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,680
I'm leaving in the morning.

212
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,080
What changed your mind?

213
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,480
I got to know you.

214
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,240
Well. What do we do now?

215
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,560
I leave, and you take care.

216
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,400
What happens to you?

217
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,240
Who'd they send to get me? You?

218
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,560
No probably just some ordinary man...

219
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,280
Who's morals wouldn't keep him  
 from shooting you in the back!

220
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,880
Shit! One more time...  
 - Alright, alright

221
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,840
Ready, set, go!

222
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,960
Damn it!  
 - See? I hit it!

223
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,720
Right... this time I'm gonna get the one on the left!

224
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,160
I gave her a little polish.

225
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,040
I can see you don't believe in rust.

226
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,920
So you can shoot straighter.

227
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh. By the way.

228
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,160
Yeah?

229
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,960
It was a fine party.

230
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,760
Sure was!

231
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,400
Real nice sendaway for Clayton!

232
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,200
Sendaway?!?  
 - Yeah...

233
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,680
He'll be leaving first thing in the morning!

234
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,680
Chapter 6:  
 Fatal Attraction

235
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,720
Seems like we been here before.

236
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,400
Throw me my pants!

237
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,045
I can't get that old thing to work...  

238
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,840
I can't get that old thing to work...  
 Sure you can.

239
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,440
I'll fix us some breakfast.

240
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,360
Let's go back to bed...

241
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,365
You've been with him, haven't you?  

242
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,160
You've been with him, haven't you?  
 YOU'VE BEEN WITH HIM, HAVEN'T YOU?!?

243
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,440
It wasn't his fault!

244
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,800
He's getting away! HE'S GETTING AWAY!

245
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,080
Chapter 7:  
 The Trouble With Women

246
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,925
I killed my husband!  

247
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,400
I killed my husband!  
 He found out about us and started beating me.

248
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,845
He was going to come after you...  

249
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,320
He was going to come after you...  
 I didn't mean to kill him!

250
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,240
A man's life for another man's moment of weakness?

251
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,280
That hardly seems like a fair trade.

252
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,565
What am I going to do?  

253
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,440
What am I going to do?  
 - It's your call...

254
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,400
I guess you can't stay here.

255
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,600
Will you take me to Liberty?  

256
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,240
You got any money?

257
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,320
I've got his rifle...

258
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,960
He told me once, it was worth a hundred silver...

259
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,765
Alright, I'll take it.  

260
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,080
Alright, I'll take it.  
 - And you'll take me!

261
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,760
I had a feeling you'd be trouble.

262
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,565
I told you, you can't trust that darned Clayton Young!

263
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,400
I chased him from district to district for a year,  
 and you just give him back his guns.

264
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,120
Are you implying that you mistrust my judgement, Sheriff?

265
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,240
Well, he did kill two of my scouts so far.

266
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:27,000
Has the thought occurred to you that maybe,  
 just maybe, he doesn't like your men?

267
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,120
And to tell you the truth, I couldn't blame him either!

268
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:32,960
Governor! Sir!

269
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,560
You cannot keep on contracting outsiders.  
 It will weaken the men's morale.

270
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,120
Thank you for your assessment, Marshal.

271
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,485
Clayton Young is not an outsider, he's an outlaw!  

272
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,600
Clayton Young is not an outsider, he's an outlaw!  
 - I meant "thank you" as in "get lost".

273
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,840
The killing of our scout proves one thing:  
 That Clayton Young is on his way here.

274
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:59,000
I've met this man, and he won't be able to resist  
 getting his hands on 5000 silver.

275
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,280
Is that clear enough?

276
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,205
This meeting isn't over yet!  

277
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,840
This meeting isn't over yet!  
 - What was it?

278
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,440
"Get lost", was it?

279
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,000
Oh. Well if my recruiting techniques  
 aren't to your liking...

280
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,440
... perhaps we can put your son in our  
 Spartan-Programme, Jack.

281
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Did you know he fathered a boy fourteen years ago,  
 and he "forgot" to inform me?

282
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,520
Well nothing evades my knowledge,  
 you should know better than that, Jack!

283
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,240
Mister Lafort... please... please don't

284
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,440
Have your wife deliver the boy to the barracks in a fortnight.

285
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,360
Or I'll have some of the Marshal's unit make her.

286
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,760
And as for that Matthew Saberneck...

287
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,840
... I bet he's dead already.

288
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,760
Chapter 8:  
 Love On The Run

289
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,400
This is the last stop before Liberty.  
 Do they know you here?

290
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,560
Matthew always went with the boys to get supplies.  
 They never took me.

291
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,600
Good.

292
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,800
I only need to rest for a few hours...

293
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,720
Then we can go on.

294
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,480
We're having a meal and a bath. Then we're leaving.

295
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,480
I don't want to be a bother.

296
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,120
To late for that.

297
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,680
Hello?

298
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,160
Anybody here?

299
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,160
Excuse me, my husband must be resting.  
 Can I help you?

300
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Yeah. I need a room for me and...

301
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,120
Your wife.

302
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,560
This way.

303
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,360
The room is three silver in advance.

304
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,760
Half a silver extra for the bath.

305
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,920
Dinner is eight o'clock. One silver each.

306
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,365
Take ten.  

307
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,680
Take ten.  
 And forget you ever saw us.

308
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,960
I've already seen you.

309
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,440
That's why you keep staring at me?

310
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,680
Come here.

311
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,925
What for?  

312
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,240
What for?  
 - This is the honeymoon suite.

313
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,520
Chapter 9:  
 Caught In The Act

314
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,520
So much for a short break.

315
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,240
You're the only man I've been with...  
 apart from my husband.

316
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,080
What about the Governor?

317
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,120
When he heard about me, he came east...

318
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,120
He took me from my parents.

319
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,280
Kept me as some kind of trophy.

320
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,280
He "heard" about you?

321
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,480
It's these stupid things they say  
 because of my eyes...

322
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,960
A blue-eyed Indian girl is kind of a collector's item...

323
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,840
I'm one in a billion.

324
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:40,400
It's said that the man I fall in love with  
 will become invincible.

325
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,205
Now I understand.  

326
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,960
Now I understand.  
 - Exactly.

327
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:54,120
The Governor never touched me...  
 So that I would fall in love with him.

328
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,280
No, not that...

329
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,840
Now I understand how truly crazy that guy is!

330
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,240
Thanks.

331
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,160
Morning, Virgil!  
 - Morning.

332
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,600
What can I do for you?  
 - I'll take ten of those chemical torches please.

333
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,360
Yes. It's five silver then.

334
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,080
Did your husband fix any breakfast?  
 - Yes, right now.

335
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,280
I'll take some eggs and coffee.

336
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,925
Just eat your breakfast.  

337
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,880
Just eat your breakfast.  
 - Mister Young!

338
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,800
Already on the road again

339
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,840
Morning.

340
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,800
Where's Matt?

341
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,960
Back at his place...  
 We're just taking a little trip.

342
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I killed him! It was an accident.

343
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,960
If that be the case, I'm taking you back.

344
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,160
Sorry. She's coming with me.

345
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,120
This ain't your affair, Mister!

346
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,920
Either I take her, or I'll have to draw on you.

347
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,680
I wouldn't.

348
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,640
You got a wife, and a kid on the way.

349
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,880
They need you a lot more than Matt needs her now.

350
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,685
It's suicide boy.  

351
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,800
It's suicide boy.  
 I can't help that!

352
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,280
That's enough, boy!

353
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,920
Let's go.

354
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,280
Not so fast, bigmouth!

355
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,000
LOOK OUT!

356
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,320
Chapter 10:  
 First Blood

357
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,200
Stupid.

358
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,400
Go check it out!

359
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,880
It's the coroner from China station!

360
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,200
He didn't stand a chance.

361
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,960
It's Virgil!

362
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,525
Who dunnit?  

363
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,400
Who dunnit?  
 - Clayton Young.

364
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,880
Aww, to hell with it!

365
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,440
Come on you guys!

366
00:45:40,475 --> 00:45:41,920
Matt!

367
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,405
You ain't finished!  

368
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,560
You ain't finished!  
 - He ain't going anywhere.

369
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,640
Sorry.

370
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,320
What are my choices?

371
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,600
You could teach in a school.

372
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,560
Or I do know a whorehouse you could work at.

373
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,840
Or I could get married again!

374
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,200
I think it's better not to rely on people or things  
 you can lose.

375
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,040
You never needed anyone?

376
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,400
No. And I prefer to keep it that way.

377
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,680
So you're telling me, you don't need me tonight?

378
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,040
Well... The nights do get cold up in these parts...

379
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,200
Looks like they cleared out.

380
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,600
Yeah... but not before getting to know each other real well!

381
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:24,320
Take it easy on him, willya?  
 I've never seen him upset like that.

382
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,960
They might already be in Liberty!

383
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,600
It's better if we're not seen together.  
 You go to the hotel!

384
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,520
On foot?!?

385
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,960
Have a nice walk!

386
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,920
Didn't I tell you I didn't want to be - - -

387
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,480
Oh, Mister Young!

388
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,245
Your punctuality matches your reputation.  

389
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,720
Your punctuality matches your reputation.  
 - Saberneck's dead, where's my money?

390
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:31,120
Since you killed my scout, I would need some proof.

391
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,525
I got his rifle.  

392
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,960
I got his rifle.  
 - Not good enough.

393
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,560
The girl?

394
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,600
She wasn't part of the deal.

395
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,720
I'll send someone to check on Saberneck.  
 Come back again here tomorrow.

396
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,640
You better have my money ready.

397
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,200
Chapter 11:  
 Dead Man Walking

398
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,960
This damn thing!  
 - Damn!

399
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,680
Pull up over at the pond! Hey Duke!  
 Pull up over at the pond!

400
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,520
Gimme the water bottle.

401
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,800
Ain't you gonna save your bullets for that whore?

402
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,565
Everything okay?  

403
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,360
Everything okay?  
 - He's gone crazy.

404
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,160
Yeah, probably.

405
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,840
Spread out! Be careful, it could be a trap.

406
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,240
What are you doing? The wind is coming from the east!

407
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,645
Are you saying I should've smelled her?  

408
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,080
Are you saying I should've smelled her?  
 - I did.

409
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,280
I hope you don't mind...  
 I ordered for you.

410
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,960
So... Where are we going tomorrow?

411
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,240
Chapter 12:  
 Ways Of Honor

412
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,445
Your bus leaves in the morning.  

413
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,280
Your bus leaves in the morning.  
- But I want to go with you.

414
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,005
Wouldn't work.  

415
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,800
Wouldn't work.  
 - Why not?

416
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:33,360
Because I finally realised how things really are.

417
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,960
How are things?

418
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,800
I'm a Gunfighter.

419
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,005
Anyone I ever care for, dies.  

420
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,480
Anyone I ever care for, dies.  
 - That's a lie! You could quit.

421
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,200
Like Matt?

422
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,880
We'll go somewhere they don't know you.

423
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,320
You live the way you do because you want to.

424
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,120
You're afraid to care about anything.

425
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,800
You know... my father didn't have any money...

426
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:32,000
My mother's parents they had lots of money,  
 but they wouldn't give him any.

427
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,240
So my mama took poison to scare'em...

428
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:44,000
See, she didn't want to die, but she died anyway.

429
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:53,360
My father left... I stayed there with my grandparents,  
 until my dad come back to take revenge.

430
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:00,520
When the shooting stopped, there's just me left.

431
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:08,400
So I took the guns and the ammo from their bodies,  
 and I went just as far away as I could.

432
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,045
But that's the past!  

433
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,800
But that's the past!  
 We're here together, right now...

434
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,560
Look at me. Look at me!

435
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,165
Do you love me?  

436
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,000
Do you love me?  
 - Yeah.

437
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:34,000
Then I will not let you ruin our only chance!

438
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,205
There! There he is!  

439
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,560
There! There he is!  
 - Get him!

440
00:56:08,595 --> 00:56:12,200
Fire at will!

441
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,605
Concentrate fire on Saberneck!  

442
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,000
Concentrate fire on Saberneck!  
 - I guess he's not gonna pay now...

443
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,800
Give him cover!

444
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,640
Cover, you guys!

445
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,045
What the hell are you doing man, I thought you'd cover me!  

446
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,040
What the hell are you doing man, I thought you'd cover me!  
 - Man, I thought you're supposed to cover ME!

447
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,725
We gotta go!  

448
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,120
We gotta go!  
 - What's going on out there?!?

449
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,040
It's Matt...

450
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,840
Matt's guys are here, and they're after us,  
 so we gotta go!

451
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,840
NOW!

452
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,400
I'll get the bike.

453
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,120
Get back! It's not safe

454
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,800
Clayton! Are you still with me?!?

455
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,440
Yeah.

456
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,440
You got'em there!

457
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,040
Matt?

458
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,440
Matt?!? Matthew!

459
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:32,000
What... What are we gonna do now?

460
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,880
We bury Virgil... If me make it outta here alive.

461
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,640
Chapter 13:  
 Half Past Dead

462
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:05,440
Just an ordinary man... who's morals wouldn't keep him  
 from shooting you in the back.

463
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,365
He's dead alright...  

464
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,520
He's dead alright...  
 Now all I need is that damned Clayton Young.

465
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,005
Send some scouts after them!  

466
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,680
Send some scouts after them!  
 - Yes, Sir. They won't know they're being watched.

467
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,920
Ashes to ashes, you bloody traitor...

468
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:44,160
Now nothing can stop me...  
 She's all mine.

469
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,960
Like hell she is!

470
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,720
You're nothing but a dog...

471
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,600
I made you a dog of war...

472
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:04,680
You sat on your land like some stubborn guard dog...

473
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,000
I'll put you down like a dog as well!

474
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,080
Matt!

475
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,645
Where're we going now?  

476
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,960
Where're we going now?  
 - We'll head South.

477
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:39,080
To the sands?  
 No one's made it over the mountains!

478
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,365
Without the money, it's gonna be even harder...  

479
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,560
Without the money, it's gonna be even harder...  
 - What money?

480
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,405
WHAT MONEY?  

481
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,520
WHAT MONEY?  
 Stop the bike! Stop the bike!

482
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,445
It's true!

483
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,600
You made a deal with the Governor?

484
01:00:55,635 --> 01:00:58,320
You came to kill my husband!

485
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,040
Listen!

486
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,320
I was only gonna get the money we would've gotten anyway -  
 Because YOU killed him, remember?

487
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,240
I didn't mean to kill him!

488
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,160
I loved him!

489
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,280
You have a funny way of showing it!

490
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:25,720
I was only gonna get the money so we could make the escape...  
 together, you know?

491
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,640
There's a smuggler's hideout in Carpenter Valley.

492
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,480
There's tracks there heading in every direction.

493
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,640
And there's fuel.

494
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:45,600
I always wanted to head back east... Back to my people.

495
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,800
You'd like their ways!

496
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,720
I don't like nobody's ways but mine.

497
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,480
Let's go.

498
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,240
We gotta get you to a doctor!

499
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,920
I'll be alright.

500
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,405
You been shot!  

501
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,920
You been shot!  
 Yeah, well...

502
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,160
Don't you remember that Mexican guy? I think his name was Tequila?

503
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,240
Yeah...?  
 Yeah well he got shot up a lot worse than that.

504
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,080
Didn't he die?

505
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:34,440
Yeah... But I ain't got time to die.

506
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,200
I been shot in the exact same spot before,  
 must've been only scar tissue came out.

507
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:46,440
So you go on up front and keep following that trail.

508
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,280
Go on!

509
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,120
Chapter 14:  
 Act Of Vengeance

510
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,520
We have confirmation that they're heading for the base  
 in Carpenter's Valley...

511
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,080
Governor.

512
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,440
Should we deploy the troops?

513
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,000
Are you sure of the identity of our prisoner?

514
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,840
Definitely. By the looks.

515
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,205
We won't be needing any troops then.  

516
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,040
We won't be needing any troops then.  
 - Sir?!?

517
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,640
Indulge me.

518
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,000
Welcome back to the pen, Barbara.

519
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,760
I had imagined you turning into more of a lady.

520
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
It's been a while, I still know everything about you.

521
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,840
You don't know more than the shit you are.

522
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:46,120
I must admit, I was filled with some fatherly pride,

523
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,680
when I learned that you and Virgil had become engaged.

524
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,160
And even more than that, when I learned  
 that you had become pregnant.

525
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,845
I don't give a damn about that baby!  

526
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,720
I don't give a damn about that baby!  
 - Don't tempt me, Barbara!

527
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,480
And there's no need to be cursing.

528
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,125
You have my full sympathy.

529
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:11,200
I just want to know what happened to my loved ones,  
 just as yourself.

530
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,120
My loved ones?

531
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,280
You mean my parents that you killed,  
 and my brother you dumped god knows where?

532
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,885
So that's how you remember it?  

533
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,280
So that's how you remember it?  
 - What are you talking about?!?

534
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:30,120
I didn't have to kill your parents to get you;  
 they sold you to me.

535
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,280
No.

536
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:40,240
I paid your parents, and turned to leave...  
 but they were surprised.

537
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,480
They thought the amount I had given them  
 was for both of their children.

538
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:50,720
But unfortunately, your brother just didn't have your eyes.

539
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,965
So you...

540
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,580
... you just took him to the...

541
01:04:57,615 --> 01:04:59,160
... just took him to the...

542
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,000
Do you think that this is easy for me?

543
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,520
I take no pleasure in my actions!

544
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:11,080
There have to be sacrifices to keep our people alive.

545
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,840
But as a show of my good intentions,

546
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:24,960
let me clear up the rest of your family history.

547
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,240
Marshal!

548
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,200
This is the keeper of the China Inn.

549
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:39,520
Please, tell this young woman everything that you have witnessed.

550
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:45,440
Your husband came to buy some chem torches,  
 just as Mister Young had finished his breakfast.

551
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:50,480
When he recognised Virgil, he shot him without warning.

552
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,405
Go ahead, Mylady...  

553
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,720
Go ahead, Mylady...  
 Tell this poor woman the whole, sad truth.

554
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:11,240
His first shot only got him in the gut...  
 Moaning in pain, Virgil slid to the floor

555
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:18,480
Mister Young just laughed at him,  
 and then he shot him in the hand.

556
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,280
The woman who was with him screamed to stop,

557
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,000
but he went on.

558
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:30,600
He shot him in the feet, in one arm...

559
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,640
... and...

560
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:34,720
... he even shot him in the...

561
01:06:34,755 --> 01:06:36,280
STOP!

562
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:50,240
I do imagine,  
 you would like to kill that Mister Young...

563
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,760
Chapter 15:  
 On Deadly Ground

564
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,880
Hand me the rifle.

565
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,720
It's all clear.

566
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,480
Where's my lockpick?

567
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,200
Don't move!

568
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,720
This whole place is rigged!

569
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,480
What?... with Mines?!?

570
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,000
Yeah, with mines.

571
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:33,640
Why didn't you tell me? Clayton!

572
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,080
Try to get some rest.

573
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,680
I'll head back up the trail to cover our tracks,  
 and refuell the bike.

574
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,480
The sun will be up soon...

575
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,880
Yeah, there's not much time... Make the most of it!

576
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,400
Was hast du? Ist doch nur dein Ehemann!

577
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,520
Chapter 16:  
 Marked For Death

578
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,320
Shit!

579
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:14,680
Damn it.  

580
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,680
Damn it.  
 - I'm going in!

581
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,160
Barb?!?

582
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,880
Barbara, what are you doing?

583
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,320
Im gonna kill that fucking sunovabitch!

584
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,640
STOOOP!

585
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,160
To hell with it!

586
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,920
BARBARA! NOOOOO!

587
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,725
Hold your fire!  

588
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:27,800
Hold your fire!  
 - Bastard!

589
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,560
I'm alright, go for it!

590
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,360
Oh no bitch, you ain't going nowhere.

591
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,565
Back off, slut!  

592
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,480
Back off, slut!  
 - Johnny?!?

593
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,880
This is all because of your whoring!

594
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:05,160
But Matt already got your stud in the arm,  
 and now he's finishing him off!

595
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:09,240
Oh yes... Why the tears?  
 I'm here!

596
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,480
Wait up, Duke!

597
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,920
There's a whiteout coming up.

598
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,360
You mean we won't find him in there?

599
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,520
He won't find himself in there!

600
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,160
He'll be going Snowblind.

601
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,600
Come on.

602
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,480
What is going on here?

603
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,960
Get off'a her!

604
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,125
That's what whores are made for!  

605
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,200
That's what whores are made for!  
 - WHAAAT?!?

606
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,200
Matt! You're killing him!

607
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,325
You're alright?  

608
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,480
You're alright?  
 - Not for long she won't be!

609
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,920
Pack your things. We're going home.

610
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,120
Chapter 17:  
 The Big Chill

611
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:47,440
Probably just some ordinary man...  
 Who's morals wouldn't keep him from shooting you in the back!

612
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,400
You're a coward!

613
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:56,400
You're afraid care about anything!

614
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:07,360
From what I've seen so far, I'm far from convinced  
 of your legendary status, Mister Young!

615
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:22,920
You will die alone, like you have lived alone.

616
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:31,200
Chapter 18:  
 Some Like It Hot

617
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:39,040
And you sort my Sword out...  
 make sure you don't mess it up this time!

618
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:45,520
Sir! Clayton Young blew that pregnant lady to pieces.  
 He was wounded, and disappeared in a whiteout.

619
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,280
And Saberneck took off with his woman.

620
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,560
Your woman! I meant, "your woman", Sir!

621
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,960
This is just what I predicted.

622
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:00,200
Matthew Saberneck is a slave to his principles,  
 So he will return to his land.

623
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,600
But only this time, I'll be waiting for him.

624
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,120
You mean you want to come with us on this mission?

625
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:10,280
Of course.  
 I want to be close when we kill them off.

626
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,120
We're gonna kill all of them?

627
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,800
NO, you imbecile!

628
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:19,040
And for every bruise that she gets, you will lose a limb!

629
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,445
Permission to speak, Sir.  

630
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,800
Permission to speak, Sir.  
 - Speak all you want, Marshal.

631
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,480
Permission to speak freely, Sir!

632
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:32,680
Always hiding behind that mask  
 of military bullcrap, aren't you Philipp?

633
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:40,600
I have become that mask, Sir.  
 It enabled me to do all you ever asked of me, Sir.

634
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:49,440
And after all that killing, and all that slaughtering,  
 you're suddenly afraid of Saberneck?

635
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:54,480
All I can say Sir, is that YOU should be afraid.

636
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,205
We will send three units.  

637
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:06,280
We will send three units.  
 And Jack, you take care of that damned Clayton Young in the meantime.

638
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:11,720
Well, how am I supposed to find him?  
 He definitely ain't no slave to principle.

639
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:18,680
No, but he's a slave of his habits.  
 So there's only one place he's going to be!

640
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,600
Round the front, cowboy!

641
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:28,160
Kassie, open the door!

642
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,720
Clayton! We heard you was dead!

643
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,200
Come in!

644
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:17,320
Don't take this the wrong way Chili...  
 I just don't think I'm in the mood.

645
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:22,960
I heard you tore up the town for some girl...

646
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,520
Yeah, guess so.

647
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,800
Must be one hell of a lucky girl then.  
 Nevermind me.

648
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,680
Boy, wait!

649
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,040
What was it you said?

650
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:08,680
If I can shoot, shoot... and don't speak.

651
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,400
So you cheated death again, huh?

652
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,920
They are coming! Should we deploy the troops?

653
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,125
Keep them hidden!  

654
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:57,240
Keep them hidden!  
 Nobody fire a shot until they're on foot

655
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:03,040
Chapter 19:  
 Enemy At The Gates

656
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,800
We'll be home soon.

657
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:21,280
It's not my home. Not anymore.

658
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,040
I want you to forget about that...

659
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:27,560
Woman.

660
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,960
I never meant to hurt you!

661
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,800
Well you damn near killed me!

662
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:45,160
I really made a mess of everything.

663
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Wait! Wait!

664
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,640
Sharpshooter!

665
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,640
It's got to be that damned Clayton Young then!

666
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,605
We're losing to many men!  

667
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,680
We're losing to many men!  
 - Let's lose some more then.

668
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,360
Send in the next unit!

669
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,800
Aww shit!

670
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,680
One hell of a homecoming!

671
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,680
Gimme a break!

672
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,960
Make your peace, little man!

673
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,400
I made mine. What about you?

674
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,520
I am ready!

675
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,680
Damn! We're out!

676
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,805
This hasn't turned out well!  

677
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,920
This hasn't turned out well!  
 I can't even see that sunovabitch!

678
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,760
Won't you please go and kill them!

679
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,720
Matthew Saberneck!

680
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:26,760
Don't shoot... You win, old man!  
 I'm the only one left!

681
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,280
You gotta be crazy coming out here like that!

682
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:36,080
You would never shoot an unarmed man!

683
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:41,205
Well...

684
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,720
I guess, I wouldn't.

685
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,320
But I would.

686
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:55,040
I'd kill a child abducting murderer any chance I get.

687
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,720
I came here... for you!

688
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:08,040
I waited for you, the whole time!

689
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:23,680
Chapter 20:  
 Death Wish

690
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:33,880
I appreciate all your help.

691
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:37,000
But there ain't nothing gonna change the way things are.

692
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,160
This doesn't have to be.

693
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,120
The hell it doesn't!

694
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,845
There's Virgil...  

695
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,200
There's Virgil...  
 and all the others who died on your account.

696
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,680
Nothing's gonna change that.

697
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,400
... and nothing's gonna change this!

698
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,280
You call it, old man.  
 Nooooo!

699
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,720
You satisfied now?

700
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:31,600
Better watch yourself young man...  
 Ain't no such thing in this world as a soft-hearted gunman.

701
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,400
You can go on with him now, if you want.

702
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,960
It was me that shot you in the back.

703
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:51,440
Well I guess all is fair in love and war

704
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,720
Don't you get it?

705
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,200
You been killed twice now, and you're still standing there.

706
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,800
The blue-eyed girl's one true love...

707
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,320
... that's you!

708
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,960
Oh boy!

709
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,080
Where you're heading?

710
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:05,760
South! Like I said, I'm leaving for good.

711
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,280
What about you?

712
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:13,160
Well... I think it's about time we pack up and...

713
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,720
... head east!

714
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:25,520
Okay, which way is east?!?

715
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,440
