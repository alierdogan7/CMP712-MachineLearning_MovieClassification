Comanche.

Come to relieve me, Tom?

14

Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

I can't think of one.

Houston wants us to attack

106
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:19,555

107
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:21,588

108
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,756

Houston's skirmish yesterday

127
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,974

130
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:32,649
It's our lifeline.

131
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:35,244
(Almonte): Would it not be
better to abandon this position

132
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:37,121
until we can rejoin all our armies

133
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:38,790
and then pursue Houston on the offensive?

134
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:40,020
Why?

135
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,634
We have him!

Here and now.

137
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:47,682

Amen.

If you've come to bear arms with us,

177
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:23,346
then I'll assign you to
Colonel Lamar's cavalry.

178
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:24,764
I'll be assigned no man.

179
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:26,307
Be clear on that.

180
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:31,229
But we'll kill Mexicans alongside you

181
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:34,920
till every brown breathing
bastard lies dead.

182
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,109
Fair enough.

183
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:39,445
When I'm ready to attack,
I'll give you a sign.

184
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:40,947
Watch for it.

my way might be my last.

567
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:50,242
Don't say such things.

568
00:35:50,272 --> 00:35:51,539
You know, my whole life,

569
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,084
people have been telling
me what's good for me.

570
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:56,962
(Man): Back over when you've got a minute.

571
00:35:57,753 --> 00:36:00,253
You'd be a damn fool not to go with him.

572
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,178
No, you're the fool, Kit Acklin.

573
00:36:09,745 --> 00:36:12,085
(Crunching, man screaming)

574
00:36:12,115 --> 00:36:14,462
(Houston): Where am I?

575
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,844
Did they cut my leg off?

576
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,417
(Doc Ewing): No, but
your ankle was shattered.

577
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:20,981
If sepsis sets in,

578
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:24,305
you will die a slow, miserable death.

579
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,640
Any word from Emily?

580
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,606
(Doc Ewing): No.

581
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:28,976
We got to get you to New Orleans.

582
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:31,479
If not, should you fall unconscious,

583
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,815
I will have that leg off.

584
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:37,527
I'll take my chances in New Orleans.

585
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,360
Emily.

586
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,392
(Distant gunfire)

587
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,784
(Coughing)

588
00:37:06,466 --> 00:37:09,334
(Indistinct shouting)

589
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:11,378
(Shushing)

590
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:18,510
(Distant shouting)

591
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:21,596
(Distant cannonfire)

592
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:28,353
(Whimpering)

593
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,320
Am I dying, padre?

594
00:37:42,953 --> 00:37:43,952
Si.

595
00:37:54,215 --> 00:37:56,215
(Sobbing)

596
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:05,140
(Karnes): Deaf.

597
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,456
Deaf!

598
00:38:07,897 --> 00:38:10,061
(Flames crackling)

599
00:38:12,765 --> 00:38:15,680
(Distant banging)

600
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:33,042
(Loud banging)

601
00:38:35,461 --> 00:38:37,255
(Knowles): Oh-ho!

602
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:41,342
Well, chop my legs and call me Shorty.

603
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:44,095
Vern! Vern, ain't this swank?

604
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:45,876
Ain't this swank?

605
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:46,998
Close this thing.

606
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:48,396
Hey, take a look at this.

607
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,592
Take a look at this.

608
00:38:49,635 --> 00:38:51,344
(Breathes noisily): One second.

609
00:38:51,946 --> 00:38:54,153
General Santa Annabella herself.

610
00:38:54,183 --> 00:38:56,199
Ooh, well, hello there.

611
00:38:56,229 --> 00:38:58,447
Hello. Hello, there.

612
00:38:58,477 --> 00:39:00,311
The spoils of war, son.

613
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:01,842
We grab what we can hold,

614
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,564
and we cut out of here tonight.

615
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,066
Yes, sir. Whoa, whoa, no.

616
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:06,359
I don't know.

617
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:07,610
Vern, Vern, hey, Vern.

618
00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:09,491
You got to understand.

619
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:11,147
I'm a hero now.

620
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:14,288
I saved the war secretary's life.

621
00:39:14,694 --> 00:39:18,529
I heard you tripped
over a bunch of Mexicans.

622
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:19,530
It...

623
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:20,508
(Thudding and grunting)

624
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:21,999
Ha!

625
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,664
Eureka.

626
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,193
Holy shit.

627
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,206
(Gun cocks)

628
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:48,710
(Colby Pitt): Surrender, Mexican,

629
00:39:48,752 --> 00:39:51,754
or I'll kill you deader than last Tuesday.

630
00:39:51,797 --> 00:39:55,550
On your knees. On your knees.

631
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,927
Are you alone?

632
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,887
Maybe.

633
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,608
Hands up.

634
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,097
Hands up!

635
00:40:18,106 --> 00:40:19,566
God damn. We can't get it all now.

636
00:40:19,608 --> 00:40:22,193
Got to come back before we head out.

637
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:24,362
- (Metallic clattering)
- (Gasps)

638
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,548
Well, goodness gracious.

639
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,472
What is this?

640
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:34,472
It's the mother lode...
Santa Anna's treasure.

641
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,474
You snakes weren't gonna tell me about it?

642
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,684
Well, why should we?

643
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,548
We found it.

644
00:40:39,578 --> 00:40:42,163
Lucky for me,

645
00:40:42,193 --> 00:40:43,848
so did I.

646
00:40:43,891 --> 00:40:47,323
(Karnes): That there must
be El Presidente's tent.

647
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,583
(Elwood): Cover this shit up. That's right.

648
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,739
- All right.
- Cover it up.

649
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,855
- All right.
- That's right.

650
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,896
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-whee!

651
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:05,303
Awful highfalutin.

652
00:41:05,345 --> 00:41:07,555
(Laughs)

653
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,187
Looks like this place done been looted.

654
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,052
We was just picking up
a few souvenirs, man.

655
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,825
Spoils of war and such.

656
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:17,277
Well, you know that looting

657
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:21,611
could get you court-martialed and shot.

658
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:24,897
- (Laughs nervously)
- What, you mean...

659
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,861
even for a token or two
for our loyalty to Texas?

660
00:41:29,903 --> 00:41:31,785
Listen up.

661
00:41:31,815 --> 00:41:34,171
All this belongs to the Texas government.

662
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:36,588
So if you don't mind, I'll take...

663
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:39,537
- Captain, you all right?
- Son of a bitch.

664
00:41:40,736 --> 00:41:42,707
(Quietly): Damn.

665
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,807
Oh, lookee here.

666
00:41:47,248 --> 00:41:49,303
Would you look at that?

667
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:52,592
Santa Anna must've buried that, right?

668
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:54,594
Must have.

669
00:41:54,636 --> 00:41:55,970
All of it.

670
00:42:01,656 --> 00:42:05,980
(Loud thud)

671
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,900
(Metallic clinking and thud)

672
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:10,902
(Quietly): Damn.

673
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:13,738
(Indistinct chatter)

674
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,783
(Scattered cheering)

675
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,877
(Man): Yeah!

676
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,922
(All cheering)

677
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,593
How about that?

678
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,721
(Man): Vive, El Presidente!

679
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,681
(Man): Yeah!

680
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,356
(Doc Ewing): It's a tincture of opium, Sam,

681
00:42:43,386 --> 00:42:46,103
for the pain.

682
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,023
Quart of warm whiskey
would work just as well.

683
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:55,413
General, you've got to see this.

684
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:56,619
He needs to rest.

685
00:42:56,649 --> 00:42:58,149
I need fresh air.

686
00:42:58,192 --> 00:43:00,527
Fetch my clothes.

687
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:03,279
Haul me up, Tom.

688
00:43:03,322 --> 00:43:06,324
(Hockley): By my count,
we have over 20,000 pieces

689
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,825
of silver and gold...

690
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:10,495
all of Santa Anna's
personal valuables, sir.

691
00:43:10,538 --> 00:43:13,206
(Seguin): General, we must give
these to the people of Tejas.

692
00:43:13,249 --> 00:43:15,500
(Rusk): Gentlemen, there is
no discussion on this matter.

693
00:43:15,543 --> 00:43:17,168
Funds seized from the enemy

694
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:20,672
belong to the newly liberated Republic.

695
00:43:20,714 --> 00:43:22,173
(Man): Another group going in.

696
00:43:22,216 --> 00:43:24,676
(Rusk): It all goes to Texas.

697
00:43:28,722 --> 00:43:31,849
Karnes, that soldier there.

698
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:33,101
Bring him to me.

699
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,519
(Karnes): Sir.

700
00:43:34,562 --> 00:43:36,521
Flores, fetch Colonel Almonte.

701
00:43:36,564 --> 00:43:38,898
Yes, sir.

702
00:43:38,928 --> 00:43:40,191
(Man): Move!

703
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:41,979
(Indistinct chatter)

704
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:45,109
- (Flores): Colonel Almonte...
- (Karnes): Come on.

705
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,695
So you're a private.

706
00:44:01,285 --> 00:44:04,537
Si, señor.

707
00:44:05,217 --> 00:44:07,598
Colonel Almonte,

708
00:44:07,628 --> 00:44:10,588
why do your men salute him?

709
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:11,835
Regretfully,

710
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:13,987
I do not know all my soldiers, sir.

711
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:15,889
That's too bad.

712
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,169
Private Pitt,

713
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:20,151
execute your prisoner.

714
00:44:22,418 --> 00:44:23,835
(Colby Pitt): Yes, sir.

715
00:44:25,337 --> 00:44:27,505
(Houston): No, private.

716
00:44:28,673 --> 00:44:30,341
Put him up against a tree

717
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:32,923
so his brains don't splatter.

718
00:44:36,122 --> 00:44:39,642
I am Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.

719
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:40,651
Wait. He's Santa Anna?

720
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:44,268
And I am Sam Houston.

721
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:46,466
El Presidente, General,

722
00:44:46,736 --> 00:44:48,757
I cannot express

723
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:52,555
how glad I am to meet you.

724
00:44:52,871 --> 00:44:54,604
I ask to be treated as a general should be

725
00:44:54,634 --> 00:44:57,168
when made a prisoner of war.

726
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:58,461
Men!

727
00:44:58,504 --> 00:45:00,547
We captured Santa Anna!

728
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:03,508
We must convene a tribunal and execute him.

729
00:45:03,551 --> 00:45:06,177
(Baker): Death by firing squad!

730
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,180
(All): yeah!

731
00:45:09,223 --> 00:45:10,515
(All talking at once)

732
00:45:10,558 --> 00:45:12,058
Yeah!

733
00:45:12,101 --> 00:45:15,103
(All shouting)

734
00:45:16,905 --> 00:45:19,991
The conqueror of the Napoleon of the West

735
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:23,870
can afford to be generous
to the vanquished, no?

736
00:45:23,912 --> 00:45:25,788
You should have remembered that, sir,

737
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:27,498
at the Alamo.

738
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:30,376
At the Alamo, your defenders chose to die.

739
00:45:30,419 --> 00:45:32,416
You offered them no alternative.

740
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:34,568
- (Spits)
- Bastardo.

741
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,307
Juan...

742
00:45:38,151 --> 00:45:39,819
This is war, sir,

743
00:45:39,861 --> 00:45:43,168
and no one here is good or bad,

744
00:45:43,693 --> 00:45:45,863
just winners

745
00:45:45,893 --> 00:45:49,473
and losers.

746
00:45:49,503 --> 00:45:51,898
I acted under the orders
from my government.

747
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,191
You are yourself the government.

748
00:45:54,234 --> 00:45:55,776
That's damn right.

749
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,029
(Rusk): Texas formed a
recognized government.

750
00:45:58,071 --> 00:45:59,697
We are not pirates.

751
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,699
The rules of war applied.

752
00:46:01,742 --> 00:46:04,201
General, why are we even
talking to this murderer?

753
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:05,849
He needs to swing.

754
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:08,673
Firing squad, here and now!

755
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:12,343
(All): Yeah!

756
00:46:12,386 --> 00:46:15,471
(All talking at once): Do it!

757
00:46:15,514 --> 00:46:16,973
- Yeah!
- (Men shouting)

758
00:46:30,994 --> 00:46:34,866
(Men shouting)

759
00:46:34,908 --> 00:46:37,156
(Houston): There'll be no firing squad.

760
00:46:37,186 --> 00:46:39,178
(Man): We want blood!

761
00:46:39,221 --> 00:46:41,868
(Houston): That cannot happen.

762
00:46:41,898 --> 00:46:45,309
Alive, Santa Anna is of great value to us.

763
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,962
If we execute him,

764
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:51,298
he'll just be another dead soldier.

765
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:53,155
Let us take our reparations.

766
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,194
Open his war chest.

767
00:46:55,237 --> 00:46:57,154
Gold to every man in my command.

768
00:46:57,197 --> 00:47:01,367
Equal shares for all those
who risked their lives.

769
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:03,786
General Seguin, General Sherman,

770
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:05,621
show the men.

771
00:47:05,664 --> 00:47:06,914
Divvy it up.

772
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,834
(Sherman): Yes, sir.

773
00:47:09,876 --> 00:47:12,878
(All cheering)

774
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,530
General, we're taking him.

775
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,858
Retribution goes hand in hand

776
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,346
with victory.

777
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,182
Present your prisoner.

778
00:47:41,224 --> 00:47:43,517
I will not.

779
00:47:46,474 --> 00:47:48,355
All right, fine by me.

780
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,977
We end it all now.

781
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,980
My only reason for living

782
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:57,940
is to slay him.

783
00:47:59,347 --> 00:48:01,736
Ride on out of here while you can.

784
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,131
Shut your mouth, boy.

785
00:48:04,161 --> 00:48:05,856
Shoot me first.

786
00:48:06,575 --> 00:48:08,489
You don't think I will?

787
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:12,599
Soldiers, ready arms!

788
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,289
Don't fool yourself.

789
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,471
Santa Anna will die!

790
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,835
It's just a matter

791
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:46,046
of how many of us he takes with him.

792
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,136
You understand me?

793
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:58,535
(Coughs)

794
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,591
Charmaine.

795
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,783
(Horse neighs)

796
00:50:13,813 --> 00:50:15,678
(Groans)

797
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,876
Come here, girl.

798
00:50:17,906 --> 00:50:19,223
Come here.

799
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,387
You saved me today.

800
00:50:33,672 --> 00:50:35,563
Oh, sweet girl.

801
00:50:37,724 --> 00:50:39,105
(Groans)

802
00:50:39,135 --> 00:50:42,976
(Horse whinnies)

803
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:46,141
No.

804
00:50:50,288 --> 00:50:54,458
Why'd you have to go do that for?

805
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:56,001
Why'd you do that?

806
00:51:18,024 --> 00:51:20,234
I'm so sorry.

807
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,038
(Crying): I'm so sorry.

808
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,337
Come on. Let's get you off that leg.

809
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,547
Let's get you off that leg, okay?

810
00:51:50,236 --> 00:51:52,558
You do me a favor.

811
00:52:00,205 --> 00:52:02,743
You do me a favor.

812
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,788
You wait for me. You hear?

813
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,754
You wait for me.

814
00:52:08,784 --> 00:52:11,535
You'll be seeing me real soon.

815
00:52:13,622 --> 00:52:14,872
(Gun cocks)

816
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:17,541
(Exhales)

817
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:18,959
(Gunshot)

818
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:20,669
(Gunshot echoing)

819
00:52:20,712 --> 00:52:23,380
(Crying)

820
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:36,602
(Snickers)

821
00:52:36,645 --> 00:52:39,647
(Indistinct chatter in Spanish)

822
00:52:54,788 --> 00:52:57,039
(Distant galloping)

823
00:52:57,082 --> 00:52:58,290
(Man screaming)

824
00:52:58,333 --> 00:53:02,044
(All speaking Spanish)

825
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:03,254
(Lorca): Get every one of them!

826
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:04,588
Every one of them!

827
00:53:04,631 --> 00:53:05,798
Hey, come on!

828
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:07,133
(Gunshot, woman screams)

829
00:53:07,175 --> 00:53:08,467
Come on!

830
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,053
(People shouting indistinctly)

831
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,516
(Panting)

832
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:20,271
(Gunshot)

833
00:53:20,313 --> 00:53:23,315
(Laughter)

834
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:26,402
(Gasps)

835
00:53:29,863 --> 00:53:31,365
No! He's just a child.

836
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,783
Nits make lice.

837
00:53:32,826 --> 00:53:35,202
We're done killing women and children!

838
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,787
Then get out of here!

839
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,964
I aim to kill Mexicans,
and I ain't done yet.

840
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,292
- Go.
- All right.

841
00:53:41,334 --> 00:53:43,168
Just go, man. Go.

842
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:45,254
Go!

843
00:53:45,297 --> 00:53:46,839
Come on, man.

844
00:53:50,886 --> 00:53:54,138
Give me the boy.

845
00:54:00,854 --> 00:54:02,980
(Gunshot)

846
00:54:09,196 --> 00:54:10,584
(Thunder rumbles)

847
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:12,073
(Houston): Any word from Deaf?

848
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:13,449
(Flores): No, General.

849
00:54:13,892 --> 00:54:15,100
And Miss West?

850
00:54:15,143 --> 00:54:16,727
Nothing, sir.

851
00:54:19,335 --> 00:54:21,268
Very well.

852
00:54:26,279 --> 00:54:29,281
You wanted to keep me alive, no?

853
00:54:29,324 --> 00:54:32,409
Once you are gone, these men will hang me.

854
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:36,121
Tell me something.

855
00:54:36,164 --> 00:54:39,306
Your generals... will they retreat

856
00:54:39,336 --> 00:54:42,177
once they're informed
you've been taken hostage?

857
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,216
No.

858
00:54:43,696 --> 00:54:45,781
Their orders are to engage.

859
00:54:50,711 --> 00:54:53,755
Then I recommend you rescind those orders.

860
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:58,610
So you want Texas

861
00:54:58,653 --> 00:55:01,572
in exchange for my life, huh?

862
00:55:01,614 --> 00:55:03,073
Sounds like a trade.

863
00:55:03,116 --> 00:55:04,283
(Rusk): Only President Burnett

864
00:55:04,325 --> 00:55:06,368
can negotiate a treaty.

865
00:55:06,411 --> 00:55:08,245
(Houston): Well, he
can't very well negotiate

866
00:55:08,288 --> 00:55:10,080
if El Presidente here is dead.

867
00:55:10,123 --> 00:55:11,582
Now, can he?

868
00:55:16,463 --> 00:55:18,088
(Woman): I'll need them vials.

869
00:55:18,131 --> 00:55:21,091
(Indistinct chatter)

870
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,618
Kit,

871
00:55:26,648 --> 00:55:28,751
are you sure you're fit to ride?

872
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:30,943
Hey, now, don't fuss.

873
00:55:30,985 --> 00:55:32,319
In case I need tending to,

874
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:35,557
Doc Ewing's coming with the General.

875
00:55:36,574 --> 00:55:38,367
I'll see you when I get back.

876
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:39,910
I certainly hope so...

877
00:55:39,953 --> 00:55:42,788
if you don't get yourself killed.

878
00:56:15,738 --> 00:56:19,871
(Elwood whistling)

879
00:56:26,499 --> 00:56:29,501
(Doc Ewing): Sarah, you got
my medical bag packed up yet?

880
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:34,828
I'll be seeing you.

881
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:37,234
(Doc Ewing): Sarah!

882
00:56:46,327 --> 00:56:48,203
Where you heading to, Vern?

883
00:56:50,628 --> 00:56:53,083
War is over for me, Knowles.

884
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:54,293
I done my duty.

885
00:56:54,335 --> 00:56:56,587
Had my fill of taking orders.

886
00:56:56,855 --> 00:56:59,047
Might head on down to Victoria.

887
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,879
Mm.

888
00:57:00,909 --> 00:57:02,493
You want to know my guess?

889
00:57:02,966 --> 00:57:06,413
You and Gator are going after that bank.

890
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:09,500
Gator's so full of bunkum,
if he told me water was wet,

891
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:12,503
I'd have to poke my finger
in and feel for myself.

892
00:57:13,947 --> 00:57:15,781
Kit didn't trust him.

893
00:57:16,123 --> 00:57:17,245
You ought not to neither.

894
00:57:17,275 --> 00:57:18,921
Well, I ain't robbing no bank.

895
00:57:18,951 --> 00:57:20,457
I'm a hero now.

896
00:57:20,487 --> 00:57:23,155
Got a reputation to uphold.

897
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:31,705
Well, if you want to ride
your hero ass along with me,

898
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,123
you're welcome.

899
00:57:34,709 --> 00:57:36,788
Well...

900
00:57:38,505 --> 00:57:40,631
no, thank you, my friend.

901
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:44,259
I reckon I'll just stay put.

902
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:49,797
Good luck with that shit.

903
00:57:52,905 --> 00:57:55,124
Tell them boys I say adios.

904
00:57:55,154 --> 00:57:57,071
All right.

905
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:04,429
You lily-livered weasel.

906
00:58:04,472 --> 00:58:05,722
How in the hell am I supposed

907
00:58:05,765 --> 00:58:07,504
to take this bank by myself?

908
00:58:07,534 --> 00:58:11,036
Well, why don't you
recruit Karnes and Anderson?

909
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:26,723
(Houston): Tom, I want you
to ride on ahead to Burnett.

910
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,546
Formalize our agreement with Santa Anna.

911
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,153
Buckley and Seguin will
take charge of the army

912
00:58:32,183 --> 00:58:33,340
while I'm away.

913
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,268
(Rusk): You get that leg healed up, Sam.

914
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,561
Texas needs you.

915
00:58:36,591 --> 00:58:37,562
(Grunts)

916
00:58:37,592 --> 00:58:41,444
You just gonna leave me behind, is that it?

917
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:44,770
Well, I'll be damned.

918
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,438
I'd about given up on you.

919
00:58:47,805 --> 00:58:50,534
I had to lay Charmaine to rest.

920
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:54,113
(Karnes): Partner, damn.

921
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,073
You look like something the cat dragged in

922
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:58,594
that the goat wouldn't eat.

923
00:58:58,624 --> 00:58:59,878
Right here.

924
00:58:59,908 --> 00:59:00,744
(Coughs)

925
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,080
Let it out.

926
00:59:03,351 --> 00:59:05,207
Let it on out.

927
00:59:08,161 --> 00:59:09,551
(Houston): Private Pitt.

928
00:59:10,984 --> 00:59:12,214
The man that captured Santa Anna

929
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,680
ought to make a damn good Ranger.

930
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,456
Your first assignment:

931
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,762
Take Captain Smith home to his wife.

932
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,417
Yes, sir.

933
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:23,309
Sorry to hear about Charmaine.

934
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,787
(Smith): Anybody fetch me a new mount yet?

935
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:28,824
(Doc Ewing): Get a wagon
and lay him down in back.

936
00:59:28,993 --> 00:59:31,066

your old crippled ass?

941

Karnes will take command of the Rangers.

942
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,469

944

Go home, old friend.

945
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:11,361
The Republic of Texas
is grateful for your service.

946

947

948

949
01:00:17,702 --> 01:00:19,398
Got to get Houston to New Orleans

950
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,068

Mmm!

962
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,221
You think you are a man of destiny,

963
01:01:50,264 --> 01:01:52,140
but all I see

964
01:01:52,183 --> 01:01:54,184
is President Jackson's puppet.

965
01:01:56,228 --> 01:01:58,938
All I see is a man in a chicken coop.

966
01:01:59,081 --> 01:02:01,708
I am defending my people
against pirates like you,

967
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,081

968
01:02:04,111 --> 01:02:07,906

aside with a footnote.

969
01:02:07,948 --> 01:02:09,491
Perhaps.

970
01:02:09,533 --> 01:02:10,867
Better a footnote

971

you did in San Jacinto.

We are men on opposite sides,

975
01:02:20,377 --> 01:02:22,796
yet there is much we share.

976
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:25,340
A love of our countries,

977
01:02:25,382 --> 01:02:29,010
a love of... other things.

978
01:02:29,053 --> 01:02:31,429
A remarkable woman, Miss West.

979
01:02:32,608 --> 01:02:34,766
An extraordinary woman,

980
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:37,056

981

982
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,632
I hear women are quite skilled

983
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:45,051

984
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:48,805
"Oh, Antonio, yes, yes, more.

985
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,473
Give me more."

986
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:53,184
Give him another one, Doc.

987
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:56,271
He's wrestling with
what defeat tastes like.

Colonel Portilla's got Emily West.

990
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:28,219
Wants to trade her for Santa Anna.

991
01:03:30,401 --> 01:03:32,223
A whore for a chief of state.

992
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:36,269
Portilla is losing his mind.

993
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:44,602
Give this back to him.

994
01:03:46,366 --> 01:03:47,891

Whoa, whoa. Keep your head, mister.

it along with your scalp.

- All right.

1010

watching all your caterwauling,

1216
01:19:56,049 --> 01:19:58,133

me around this long.

1221
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:17,281

Now, when you get older, well,

1226
01:20:47,049 --> 01:20:51,103
I'm gonna expect you
to account for yourself.

1227

young lady like yourself.

want to annex our Texas.

1236

If you would accept this...

1237
01:22:06,971 --> 01:22:09,014
It must be used for good.

1238
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,266

as well as the collateral...

1239

1245
01:22:27,189 --> 01:22:29,047
They may have cleaned you up.

1246
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:30,665

1253
