00:03:53,763 --> 00:03:56,629
That's where I'm headed.
I'll get you home.

[Whispers] No.

15
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,063
I've got to go to him.

16
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,263
He needs me.

17
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,896
There's nothing but Apaches for 60
miles between here and ft. Creel.

18
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,230
The Apaches won't hurt me.

22
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:37,063
Look.

23
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:00,130
There.

24
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,496
Good afternoon. What
can I do for you?

25
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:32,230
Oh.

26
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,663
Did you find her?

27
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,030
Where's the horse
she was riding?

28
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:50,163
Dead.

29
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,464
That's too bad.

30
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:08,197
You take care of my horse?

31
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:10,696
Where did you find Mrs. Grange?

32
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:12,529
Give him plenty of
feed and water.

33
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:13,930
He needs it.

34
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:15,796

Jess Remsberg.

38
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:35,763
I see they've busted you
back to corporal again.

39
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,230
Yeah, twice.

40
00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:38,830
Say, it's been a
long time since...

41
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:40,997
yeah, yeah, it's
been a long time.

42
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:43,464
Is Scotty McAllister
out at the fort?

43
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,796
Yeah. Did you hear
he made lieutenant?

44
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,263
Tell him I'm in here, will you?

45
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,430
Sure.

46
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:10,197
Well, look at them out there.

47
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,263
Watching, waiting to see
how I'm gonna take it.

When they brought you
back the first time,

50
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,197
I tried to treat you decent.

51
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:31,397
This time, the Apaches didn't
take you away, you ran away.

52
00:10:34,997 --> 00:10:37,963
My horse is dead
and you're back.

53
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,263
Should've been the
other way around.

Please, Ellen, please.

59
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:11,364
Please, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
I didn't.

61
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:20,930
I'm sorry, will.

62
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:23,430
I'm sorry I was brought
back to shame you.

63
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:24,963
I don't like the way I feel.

64
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,364
I hate myself for it.

65
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,663
You know how I loved you.

66
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,629
You were always good to me.

67
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:36,263
When Chata's band took you,

68
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,030
I just near went out of my head.

69
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,663
I hunted for you
for a whole year,

70
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,163
until I figured
they'd killed you.

71
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,097
Will, there's something
I didn't tell you...

72
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:45,496
and suddenly, you were back.

73
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:46,629
I was afraid to tell you...

74
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:47,763
I wanted for us...

75
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,763
there's something that
happened to me...

76
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,629
I don't want to
hear what happened!

77
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:54,963
I don't want to know
anything about it.

78
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,730
It's bad enough just
thinking about you

79
00:11:58,796 --> 00:11:59,997
with them Apaches all the time,

80
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:01,796
trying to stop from
thinking about it...

81
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:03,663
I had to go back to them.
I had to!

82
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,330
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

83
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:07,696
You mean, you liked living
with a bunch of savages?

84
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:09,063
You don't understand.

85
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,696
Well, no, I don't understand.

86
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,397
Lots of white women have been
grabbed off by the Indians.

87
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:15,464
Any decent one of them
would've killed herself

88
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,596
before she'd let them turn
her into an Indian squaw!

89
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,830
I'm not that decent, I guess!

90
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:23,297
Well, don't shout.
They'll hear you!

91
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:26,130
You don't care what
happens to me...

92
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:29,030
only what people
think about you.

93
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:31,063
I do business with them people.

94
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,163
The same people that treat
your wife like dirt.

95
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,364
I was better off
with the Indians.

96
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:41,230
Maybe that's where you
figured you belong.

97
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:43,297
I don't belong here anymore.

98
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,496
Maybe you don't.

Yes, sir!

114
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:04,330
That was the worst exhibition!

115
00:14:04,397 --> 00:14:05,863
Well, I know, sir, but
most of these new horses

116
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,464
are a long way from
being saddle broke...

117
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:10,330
half your men don't know one
end of a horse from the other.

118
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:12,963
Yes, sir! Come on now.
Pull it into line there!

What is it, corporal?

124
00:14:20,297 --> 00:14:22,063
Jess Remsberg's in town, sir.

125
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,830
Jess?

126
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,197
How does he look?

127
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:27,496
Well, he still ain't over
it, that's for sure.

128
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:28,763
Where is he?

129
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,230
The saloon, sir.

130
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:32,263
Harrington, you lend Sgt.
Ferguson a hand.

131
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,263
Yes, sir.

132
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,030
Sgt. Ferguson. Yes, sir?

133
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:38,030
You keep those men polishing the seats
of their pants on saddle leather

134
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:39,397
until they can do that turn.

135
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:40,496
Yes, sir!

try this maneuver once more.

down on that flag.

150
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:45,397
I've got a wagon load of goods for ft.
Concho.

00:15:45,464 --> 00:15:48,963
I'd, uh, sure appreciate it if I
can tag along with your troop.

152
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,063
No.

153
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,930
What do you mean, no? I've got
a right to army protection.

154
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,730
If I take you along, you do.
But I'm not.

155
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:07,796
My, you sure do look pretty
in that new uniform.

156
00:16:08,763 --> 00:16:10,130
Lieutenant, I'm sure...

157
00:16:10,197 --> 00:16:12,097
Grange, this trip's going
to be rough enough

158
00:16:12,163 --> 00:16:14,364
without dragging
along extra freight.

159
00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:16,830
Sorry.

160
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:18,130
[Laughs]

161
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,430
I hear you found Ellen
Grange on the way.

162
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:30,464
Her husband didn't seem too
anxious to get her back.

163
00:16:35,063 --> 00:16:36,997
Tom van scouting for you?

164
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,063
Aye.

165
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,596
I sent him down to Mexico

166
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:43,563
to check how many more warriors
have joined Chata's force.

167
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,430
I found him about
60 miles south,

168
00:16:45,496 --> 00:16:47,763
where I picked up Mrs. Grange.

169
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,364
I'd say he was 2 days
dying, Apache style.

170
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:56,163
Then Chata's already come
north across the border

171
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,364
slaughtering anyone
they've run across.

172
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,997
Not without reason, Scotty.

173
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,696
The Apaches have been holed up

174
00:17:02,763 --> 00:17:05,197
on that hellhole
reservation at San Carlos,

175
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:07,097
tricked, lied to, murdered...

176
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:09,997
it cuts both ways, Jess.

177
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:13,663
Bad enough when a man like
tom van ends the way he did.

178
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,830
When you find women and
children dead like that...

179
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,529
I've got to tell Maj.
Novac about van.

180
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:27,663
Wait a minute.

181
00:17:29,763 --> 00:17:31,563
You sent me a message.

182
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:33,896
I'm here.

183
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:37,596
Aye.

184
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,696
[Bells tinkling]

185
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,863
That's a pretty nice scalp
you got there, mister.

186
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,863
I know where an Indian
scalp like that

187
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,030
would bring a pretty good price.

188
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,663
How much you want for it?

189
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,496
What was that, McAllister?

190
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:17,330
He was going to
kill you, Toller.

191
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:20,529
All I did was ask what he
wanted for the Indian scalp.

192
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:22,563
This Indian was his wife.

193
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,130
[Gasping]

194
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:38,397
What happened?

195
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:39,830
I hit you.

196
00:18:42,063 --> 00:18:44,063
It's a good thing you did.

197
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:47,796
Where is it, Scotty?

198
00:18:56,863 --> 00:18:58,464
Where'd you get it?

199
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:01,430
Ft. Concho, from
the town marshal.

200
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:03,230
New man. Clay Dean.

201
00:19:04,596 --> 00:19:06,297
Clay Dean?

202
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:09,896
Aye. Killer for hire, wearing a badge.
You know the type.

203
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:15,696
[Sighs]

204
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:16,830
Thanks, Scotty.

205
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:21,330
Dean may not be the man.

206
00:19:21,397 --> 00:19:23,430
If he's not, he'll tell me.

207
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,629
The man who caught my wife alone is
gonna pay, and not just by dying.

208
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:29,097
He'll be praying...
stop it, Jess!

209
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:30,997
Apaches take revenge that way.
No civilized...

210
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:33,529
that was no Apache that
killed and scalped my wife.

211
00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:35,763
That was one of
your civilized men.

212
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,297
We're heading for ft. Concho
in a couple of days, Jess.

213
00:19:40,364 --> 00:19:42,230
I want you to come along.

214
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:45,663
You just wanna be with me
when I catch this man Dean.

215
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,230
You figure I'll let him die
quick and easy if you're there.

216
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:52,230
With tom van gone,
I need a scout.

217
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,097
No.

218
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:58,230
Jess. I've 2 wagon-loads of
ammunition and 25 green troopers.

219
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,896
Col. Foster needs them in ft.
Concho.

220
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:03,596
What are you bucking for?

221
00:20:03,663 --> 00:20:06,696
I can't afford any
mistakes on my record.

222
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:09,097
I'm going to be a
general some day.

223
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:12,430
I don't remember you being
so damned ambitious.

224
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,730
I'm getting married
when I get to Concho.

225
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:22,197
Sgt. Neabamer's daughter.

226
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:27,030
She'll give you hell
if I don't get there.

227
00:20:30,197 --> 00:20:33,263
I guess a week or so won't
make any difference.

228
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:41,529
We ought to bury that, Jess.

229
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,529
After I find the man
that took it off her.

230
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:03,163
Tell the major he'll
have to wait.

231
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,097
I've got some unfinished
business to take care of.

232
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:36,663
McAllister said you
wanted to kill me.

233
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,830
I don't much like that idea.

234
00:21:42,596 --> 00:21:44,397
I'd rather get it over with now,

235
00:21:44,464 --> 00:21:46,330
if the thought's
still in your mind.

236
00:21:47,997 --> 00:21:49,263
It's not.

237
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:51,896
Are you quite sure?

238
00:21:53,197 --> 00:21:54,197
I said so.

239
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:00,596
Then I apologize.

240
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,496
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

241
00:22:04,963 --> 00:22:06,629
I know you didn't.

242
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,230
[Girl screaming]

243
00:22:41,963 --> 00:22:43,430
[Men laughing]

244
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,830
Let her go.

245
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:48,130
Like hell. She tried
to steal our horses!

246
00:22:48,197 --> 00:22:50,596
She ought to be put in jail,
like any horse thief.

247
00:22:50,663 --> 00:22:52,397
No, we won't let her go

248
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:54,730
till she's nice to us, like
she was to those Apaches.

249
00:22:54,796 --> 00:22:57,097
[Man] She shouldn't mind
us, after all that time

250
00:22:57,163 --> 00:22:58,464
she took pleasuring Chata's son.

251
00:22:58,529 --> 00:22:59,696
I said, let her go.

252
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,629
Sure.

253
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:07,997
[Grunting]

254
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,863

259
00:23:43,197 --> 00:23:44,197
Ugh.

260

[Groans]

261
00:24:01,397 --> 00:24:02,397
Ugh.

262
00:24:13,863 --> 00:24:15,163
Ow!

263
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,863
[Horses neighing]

264
00:24:53,297 --> 00:24:54,529
I didn't lay a finger on you.

265
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:55,916
I wasn't gonna do
anything to her,

266
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:57,297
just tell her
husband, that's all.

267
00:24:57,364 --> 00:24:59,663
You won't tell her husband anything.
You just forget it!

268
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,230
All right, I won't, I swear!

269
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:07,163
[Panting]

270
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:18,430
I like changing odds. 2-to-1
seemed more of an even bet.

271
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:44,430
So you saved me again, Mr.
Remsberg.

272
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,063
This time you saved my honor.

273
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,963
Only, now you know there's
none left to save.

274
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,330
You sound like I ought to
apologize for butting in.

275
00:25:56,397 --> 00:25:58,730
I didn't ask you to
bring me back here.

276
00:26:00,063 --> 00:26:02,830
Look, if the Apaches had
taken you captive...

277
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:05,563
at least the Apaches didn't
spit when I walked past.

278
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:08,563
People here treat me like I'm...
I know.

279
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:12,197
I had a Comanche wife.

280
00:26:15,063 --> 00:26:17,030
Well, that's different.

281
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:18,763
No one thinks it's
wrong for a man

282
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,464
to take himself an Indian girl,

283
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:22,763
as long as he leaves her
behind when he goes.

284
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,730
I said she was my wife.

285
00:26:27,663 --> 00:26:30,163
I know how they look at you.

286
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,263
I know how they treat you.

287
00:26:34,863 --> 00:26:37,297
One of them finally
killed my wife.

288
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,230
Come on, better get you home.

289
00:26:55,997 --> 00:26:59,730
I can understand why you'd
want to run away, Mrs. Grange,

290
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:02,563
but there's something you
ought to think about.

291
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:05,030
If you go back to Chata's band,

292
00:27:05,097 --> 00:27:06,730
his son, Nachee,

293
00:27:06,796 --> 00:27:09,364
will most likely kill you
for running away from him.

294
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,397
I didn't run away.

295
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,663
I was taken away, unconscious.

296
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,163
Our brave soldiers
hit the Apache camp

297
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,464
while the men were out hunting.

298
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:21,063
The trooper who gave me this

299
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,030
almost killed me before
he saw my blond hair.

300
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,997
But if I were your husband, Mrs.
Grange...

301
00:27:30,063 --> 00:27:33,063
you are not my husband.

302
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,696
They all think any decent
woman would prefer to die

303
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:37,930
than live as an Apache squaw.

304
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,696
Maybe they're right.

305
00:27:40,763 --> 00:27:42,963
Death comes soon enough.

306
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,763
Anybody that hurries
it is a damned fool.

307
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:52,930
What I was trying to say is...

308
00:27:52,997 --> 00:27:55,163
what's over is done.

309
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,197
You and your husband
could go someplace

310
00:27:57,263 --> 00:27:59,596
where nobody knows
what happened to you.

311
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,563
My husband would know.

312
00:28:10,763 --> 00:28:12,397
# [bugle playing]

313
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:27,663
[Grange] Thanks, major.

314
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:30,397
I appreciate your cooperation.

315
00:28:30,464 --> 00:28:32,230
It's my pleasure, Mr. Grange.

316
00:28:39,896 --> 00:28:41,230
Have a seat, sergeant.

317
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:48,330
If that was a hint you want me
back in the army, no thanks.

318
00:28:48,397 --> 00:28:51,963
Toller, Chata may have already
started north across the border.

319
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,330
You know what that means.

320
00:28:54,397 --> 00:28:56,496
But as far as my
re-enlisting is concerned,

321
00:28:56,563 --> 00:28:58,130
no chance, major.

322
00:28:58,197 --> 00:29:00,163
The army owes me for 40 horses

323
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,963
I spent the last 4 months
hunting and breaking.

324
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,997
I'm planning on
investing my stakes

325
00:29:05,063 --> 00:29:06,997
in a nice, profitable
gambling saloon.

326
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:08,464
No more army for me, major.

327
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:13,430
Sir, Grange claims you've
given him permission

328
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:14,963
to accompany me to ft. Concho.

329
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,230
The army has to cooperate
with traders like Grange...

330
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,430
yes, sir, I understand.

331
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:20,063
He's been most helpful
to us many times.

332
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,430
Yes, sir. It's just that
with all green troopers,

333
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,496
and only 2 days
before we head out...

334
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,830
you don't have those
2 days, McAllister.

335
00:29:26,896 --> 00:29:29,163
You'll be starting for ft.
Concho at dawn.

336
00:29:31,097 --> 00:29:35,529
Sir, I need time to whip those raw
recruits into some kind of shape.

337
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:38,696
And half those horses Toller
delivered still aren't saddlebroke!

338
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:41,963
Then he will just have to finish
breaking them on the way to ft. Concho.

339
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,364
There's no time left... hold on!

340
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:48,030
My contract with the army calls for
delivery of fresh mounts to McAllister.

341
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:49,930
And I've delivered them.

342
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,330
Your contract reads that you'll be paid
for delivering saddlebroke horses.

343
00:29:52,397 --> 00:29:55,130
It ain't my fault that he's got
to move out before I'm finished!

344
00:29:55,197 --> 00:29:56,796
Sir, if I could have
just one more day.

345
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:58,230
You have your
orders, lieutenant.

346
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,297
Yes, sir.

347
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,430
Not with me, he don't!

348
00:30:00,496 --> 00:30:02,397
Sir.

349
00:30:02,464 --> 00:30:04,763
You can have your money for the 20
mustangs you've already broken.

350
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,696
If you want to get
paid for the rest,

351
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,596
you'll have to tag
along with McAllister.

352
00:30:08,663 --> 00:30:11,629
He'll give you a receipt for every
horse you break in on the way,

353
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:14,796
and col. Foster will pay
you for them in Concho.

354
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:18,364
The men I hired to help catch those
mustangs are paid off and gone.

355
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,863
The clothes I lived in
for 4 months, I burned.

356
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,496
I didn't buy this new outfit
to eat no trail dust.

357
00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:26,796
You're dealing me this off the bottom
of the deck. This is a swindle...

358
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:27,997
be careful, Toller!

359
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:29,629
You shut up, McAllister!

360
00:30:29,696 --> 00:30:32,496
You don't scare me none.

361
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:34,596
And you sure can't
pull no rank on me.

362
00:30:34,663 --> 00:30:36,997
Toller, I'm sorry.

363
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:39,730
But that's the way
it will have to be.

364
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,464
Hurry it up, Toller.

365
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:44,963
You might manage to break
another horse or 2 before dawn.

366
00:30:46,963 --> 00:30:50,730
You enjoy seeing me on the
horn, don't you, McAllister?

367
00:30:50,796 --> 00:30:53,197
You were a pretty good
sergeant once, Toller,

368
00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:57,430
but to me, you're just another
money-hungry civilian.

369
00:30:57,496 --> 00:31:00,730
You used to be a pretty good
sergeant yourself, McAllister,

370
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:02,663
but now you're just...

371
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:05,696
a rank officer.

372
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,397
I'll be back, major.

373
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:16,796
[Ferguson shouting orders]

374
00:31:19,763 --> 00:31:21,063
Get in there!

375
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:24,197
Move it out!

376
00:31:25,896 --> 00:31:28,529
Company, attention!

377
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:32,063
Line up in columns of 2,
dress right on the flag.

378
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,364
Fall in over there!

379
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,163
Form up in columns of 2, and
dress right on that flag.

380
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,730
Get that horse up off his back!
Go get those reins!

381
00:31:39,796 --> 00:31:42,097
Bring that horse back in here!

389
00:32:34,963 --> 00:32:35,963
Whoa!

390
00:32:39,596 --> 00:32:40,796
Grange?

391
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:42,963
Yeah?

392
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,629
You might not be able to
get any kind of an escort

393
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:48,197
back here for weeks,
maybe longer.

394
00:32:48,263 --> 00:32:49,464
So?

395
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:51,796
Might not be too good an idea,

396
00:32:51,863 --> 00:32:54,063
leaving your wife here
alone, all that time.

397
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,596
What makes it your business?

398
00:32:56,163 --> 00:32:57,397
Hmm?

399
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:00,563
Well, it doesn't make
any difference anyway.

400
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:03,730
She stole 2 horses, and
disappeared again last night.

401
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:04,997
Did you report it?

402
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:06,197
No, why should I?

403
00:33:06,263 --> 00:33:08,297
They could have sent
somebody after her.

404
00:33:08,364 --> 00:33:10,464
Now, maybe she's got
too much of a start.

405
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:12,496
If she wants to go, she can go.

406
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:14,696
Straight to hell,
for all I care.

407
00:33:30,796 --> 00:33:31,930
Sergeant,

408
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:33,629
mount up!

409
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,863
[Ferguson] Prepare to mount!

410
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,030
Mount!

# [bugle playing]

00:33:40,297 --> 00:33:42,596
Scotty, I'll be
riding out on my own.

413
00:33:42,663 --> 00:33:44,930
I'll, uh, I'll pick you
up in a couple of days.

414
00:33:44,997 --> 00:33:48,030
Remember, you're no use to
me hung up like tom van.

415
00:33:48,097 --> 00:33:49,763
Yes, mother.

416
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,630
Oh, I'll, uh, I'll need a spare horse,
in case I have to make some time.

417
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:53,730
Toller!

418
00:33:53,796 --> 00:33:55,397
I want a receipt.

419
00:33:57,696 --> 00:33:59,896
[Ferguson] Bring
that horse forward!

420
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,063
[Scotty] Drop that
guard there, trooper.

421
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,930
Pull yourself up, lad.

422
00:34:16,563 --> 00:34:18,796
Look proud, all of you.

423
00:34:18,863 --> 00:34:20,197
Move them out, sergeant.

424
00:34:20,263 --> 00:34:21,730
Yes, sir!

425
00:34:21,796 --> 00:34:24,364
Lead off to the left
in a column of twos.

426
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,097

[Man] It is your doing
Nachee is dead.

433
00:35:03,163 --> 00:35:05,496
White-eyed trappers
took him alive.

434
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:07,430
They beat him to
death with a whip.

435
00:35:11,629 --> 00:35:13,563
I didn't want him dead.

436
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:16,163
You white-eyes want us all dead.

437
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,796
But when I die, it will not be
as tame reservation Indian.

438
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,397
I will die Apache!

You can care for

Here, rub him down
while he's feeding.

You've been pushing hard.

464
00:39:04,197 --> 00:39:06,030
I didn't want to
come in after dark

465
00:39:06,097 --> 00:39:09,263
and have one of your rookies
mistaking me for an Apache.

466
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,663
Thank you.

467
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:13,496
Got anything for me?

468
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:15,330
I got a good look at Chata.

469
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:17,997
You stretch your
luck pretty thin.

470
00:39:18,063 --> 00:39:20,330
He's got about 45 armed men.
He's on the move.

471
00:39:20,397 --> 00:39:23,063
His whole camp,
women and kids...

472
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,796

[Scotty] Where's Chata headed?

474
00:39:27,629 --> 00:39:29,696
[Jess] The Mogollon range
would be my hunch.

475
00:39:29,763 --> 00:39:32,529
With his families along, he's
got to set up a permanent camp

476
00:39:32,596 --> 00:39:34,596
before he can put
on any war-paint.

477
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,397
If we could cut in ahead of
him, catch him by surprise...

478
00:39:37,464 --> 00:39:40,364
Scotty, he's got almost
50 fighting men.

479
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,297
You've got 29, including
me, Toller, and Grange.

480
00:39:43,364 --> 00:39:47,030
All I'm figuring is to hold Chata in
place long enough for reinforcements

481
00:39:47,097 --> 00:39:48,529
to reach us from Concho.

482
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:51,529
Just hold on a
minute, lieutenant.

483
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:53,629
You ain't aiming to
tangle with Chata?

If you're going to eavesdrop,

485
00:39:55,297 --> 00:39:56,896
at least keep your mouth shut.

486
00:39:56,963 --> 00:39:59,263
I put out a lot of money
for what's in that wagon.

I want to get it to Concho!

488
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,397
I didn't invite you
along, Grange!

489
00:40:02,464 --> 00:40:04,464
If you're so anxious
to get to Concho,

490
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:06,596
just hoist your butt on
that wagon of yours and go!

491
00:40:06,663 --> 00:40:08,097
You think I'm crazy?

00:40:14,896 --> 00:40:16,963
You busting with things
to say, too, Toller?

494
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,930
I don't like it any
more than Grange,

495
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:21,297
but you're the
cock-a-doodle-doo here,

496
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:22,696
so I'm stuck.

497
00:40:22,763 --> 00:40:25,230
Then?

498
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:28,063
I just finished busting you
another gut-twister. Mark it.

499
00:40:31,297 --> 00:40:33,230
Yes, sir?

500
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,130
Corporal, you'll
carry a dispatch

501
00:40:35,197 --> 00:40:37,930
to col. Foster at ft. Concho,

502
00:40:37,997 --> 00:40:40,063
and don't stop on the way.

503
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,030
Not to eat, not to sleep.
Understand?

504
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:44,163
Yes, sir.

505
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,596
Pick him out the 2 fastest
mounts we've got.

506
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:50,030
In future, Grange,

00:40:50,097 --> 00:40:52,230
when I'm having a
private conversation,

508
00:40:52,297 --> 00:40:54,529
you keep the hell away from me.

509
00:40:55,529 --> 00:40:57,063
Like right now.

510
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,097
Jess, get a solid
meal under your belt.

511
00:41:02,163 --> 00:41:04,496
I want you to ride out
to keep track of Chata.

512
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:06,197
That'll leave you
without a scout.

513
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,563
Chata could find you
before I find him.

514
00:41:09,629 --> 00:41:11,629
I'll take care of myself.

515
00:41:11,696 --> 00:41:14,297
You take care of yourself.

516
00:41:14,364 --> 00:41:17,663

got to see before I die.

Yeah?

520
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,230
If we should tangle
with Chata...

521
00:41:43,997 --> 00:41:46,896
he'll have to leave his
families unguarded.

522
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,896
There's a chance we
could get to your wife,

Mrs. Grange!

537
00:43:35,663 --> 00:43:37,030
What the...

538
00:44:03,197 --> 00:44:05,596
get your pencil ready.

539
00:44:05,663 --> 00:44:07,430
Them horses all you worry about?

540
00:44:07,496 --> 00:44:10,464
Yeah. I got 10 more to bust.
Then my worries are over.

541
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:12,930
You can still lose your
skin out here, too.

542
00:44:12,997 --> 00:44:14,763
Not if I can help it.

543
00:44:23,763 --> 00:44:25,097
Sir,

544
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,930
there's fresh pony tracks
leading across our trail

545
00:44:27,997 --> 00:44:30,696
into that canyon.

546
00:44:30,763 --> 00:44:33,596
Well, soldier boy, you
found your Apaches.

547
00:44:34,763 --> 00:44:36,230
We proceed, sir?

548
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:38,430
Tell the men we'll
advance at the ready.

549
00:44:38,496 --> 00:44:39,763
Yes, sir.

550
00:44:41,297 --> 00:44:43,397
Toller...

551
00:44:43,464 --> 00:44:45,763
do you remember the
Ojo Caliente fight?

552
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:49,529
You got an arrow in your backside
and I pulled you to cover.

553
00:44:50,796 --> 00:44:52,730
I remember.

554
00:44:52,796 --> 00:44:55,197
I have to lead the column.

555
00:44:55,263 --> 00:44:58,596
Somebody's got to find
out if Chata's up there.

556
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,063
And if I get killed,
you'll know.

557
00:45:03,163 --> 00:45:04,263
That's right.

558
00:45:05,863 --> 00:45:07,030
I see.

[Toller] Come on, you
ain't paid for yet!

564
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,130

568
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:42,063
Form a company front behind
the wagons, sergeant,

569
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:43,563
and do that about turn!

570
00:50:43,629 --> 00:50:44,796
[Ferguson] Yes, sir.

571
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,997
Let's get you mounted.

572
00:50:46,063 --> 00:50:47,130
Leave me be!

573
00:50:47,197 --> 00:50:49,230
Don't give me no
orders, McAllister!

574
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,297
[Ferguson] O'Brien!

575
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:06,896

Your leg's broke.

00:53:56,563 --> 00:53:57,763
I know.

587
00:54:10,263 --> 00:54:11,896
Sir, there's 16 dead,

588
00:54:11,963 --> 00:54:14,230
and there's some more
men that's hurt so bad

589
00:54:14,297 --> 00:54:15,997
they can't be of much use.

590
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,930
And, uh, the cook wagon's lost.

591
00:54:17,997 --> 00:54:19,464
I know, sergeant.

592
00:54:19,529 --> 00:54:20,663
All our grub, sir.

593
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:22,763
And all the water.
I know, sergeant!

594
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:24,629
Chata's got us pinned down here.

595
00:54:24,696 --> 00:54:27,464
As long as he keeps
us pinned down...

596
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:29,263
until col. Foster shows up,

597
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,696
it'll have been worth it.

598
00:54:31,763 --> 00:54:33,696
Won't it, sergeant?

599
00:54:33,763 --> 00:54:35,763
Yes, sir.

600
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:39,796
Tell the men that the water
they've got in their canteen

601
00:54:39,863 --> 00:54:43,330
will have to last them until
the reinforcements arrive.

602
00:54:44,496 --> 00:54:46,963
Any man who uses his up...

603
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:49,297
will just have to
drink his own sweat.

604
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:52,863
Yes, sir.

605
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,763
And, sergeant...

606
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,496
fine job for your
first Apache fight.

607
00:54:56,563 --> 00:54:58,197
Thank you, sir.

608
00:54:58,263 --> 00:54:59,963
Well?

609
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,030
Find shade for the
wounded and see

610
00:55:02,097 --> 00:55:04,163
that everything's done
that can be done.

611
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,963
Yes, sir.

612
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:09,896
I think the worst casualty
is that cook wagon.

613
00:55:11,663 --> 00:55:13,330
That Chata, he dealt the cards,

614
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:16,263
played us, and took
the first hand cold.

615
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:19,297
I've still got an ace
card up my sleeve.

616

Harrington?

617
00:55:20,596 --> 00:55:21,596
Aye.

618
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,696
Don't look!

619
00:55:34,763 --> 00:55:36,529
Look the other way.

It's Cpl. Harrington.

That's where Scotty is holed up.

We gotta get to those rocks
before Chata can cut us off.

When I give you the word,
you get going full out!

625
00:56:12,163 --> 00:56:14,030
Here, I'll take the boy.

626
00:56:14,097 --> 00:56:16,397
You've both got a better chance
of making it if I take him.

627
00:56:16,464 --> 00:56:17,963
Give him here.

00:58:04,696 --> 00:58:06,930
What'd you bring that here for?

654
00:58:08,696 --> 00:58:10,230
That's her son.

655
00:58:16,397 --> 00:58:17,796
Sorry, ma'am...

656
00:58:18,563 --> 00:58:20,230
I didn't mean to...

657
00:58:22,896 --> 00:58:25,896
Scotty, Harrington
didn't make it.

658
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,863
He was tortured before he died.

659
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:33,297
Probably told Chata
everything he knew.

660
00:58:33,364 --> 00:58:35,297
So Chata knows.

661
00:58:35,364 --> 00:58:38,163
I'm waiting here for reinforcements
that aren't going to arrive?

662
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,430
He also knows what you
got in those wagons.

663
00:58:40,496 --> 00:58:43,030
He wants that ammunition
and the glory.

664
00:58:43,097 --> 00:58:46,063
And he gets both
by wiping us out.

665
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,963
Which makes him bigger than
ever with the Apaches.

666
00:58:49,629 --> 00:58:50,796
Jess.

667
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:55,197
We've got to break
out and find water.

668
00:58:55,763 --> 00:58:57,230
Where?

669
00:58:57,297 --> 00:59:00,297
There's only 2 places
between here and Concho.

670
00:59:00,364 --> 00:59:02,563
One of them's where Chata
left his families,

671
00:59:02,629 --> 00:59:04,596
20 miles inside those hills.

672
00:59:04,663 --> 00:59:07,063
With those wagons,
you'll never outrun him.

673
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,730
And the other place?

674
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,297
Diablo canyon.

675
00:59:10,364 --> 00:59:13,330
Just a half a mile from
where Chata's sitting.

676
00:59:13,397 --> 00:59:17,130
But Diablo is a box canyon.
There's only one way in.

677
00:59:17,197 --> 00:59:19,830
I spotted 4 or 5 Apaches
just inside the rocks.

678
00:59:19,896 --> 00:59:22,263
That's all he'll need
to hold you out.

679
00:59:23,997 --> 00:59:28,663
Weli... what's next... general?

680
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:38,830
How old is he, ma'am?

681
00:59:38,896 --> 00:59:40,197
4 months.

682
00:59:40,263 --> 00:59:41,830
He don't favor his
mother, that's for sure.

683
00:59:41,896 --> 00:59:43,330
[Man chuckles]

684
00:59:44,696 --> 00:59:46,163
That's yours?

685
00:59:47,364 --> 00:59:48,663
Yes.

686
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:50,397
You didn't tell me that...

687
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:52,830
why?

688
00:59:52,896 --> 00:59:55,930
After the way you acted?

689
00:59:55,997 --> 01:00:00,263
So you ran off the first chance
you got to get back to this...

690
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,997
half-breed bastard!

691
01:00:02,063 --> 01:00:03,464
Ah, come off it, Grange.

692
01:00:03,529 --> 01:00:04,963
You stay out of this, Toller!

693
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,730
That's just a little
baby that's Ali...

694
01:00:06,796 --> 01:00:08,663
you keep your mouth
shut or I'll...

695
01:00:17,063 --> 01:00:18,663
you were saying?

696
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,230
Pick it up.

697
01:00:23,263 --> 01:00:24,997
Be careful, Grange.

698
01:00:25,063 --> 01:00:27,063
I told you to pick it up.

699
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:34,297
You got another one in your holster,
use that one or back water.

700

[Gun fires]

701
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:54,997
You two can play games
some other time.

702
01:00:55,063 --> 01:00:57,263
Right now, we can't spare
either one of you.

703
01:01:07,496 --> 01:01:10,130
You ought to play poker, Grange.

704
01:01:10,197 --> 01:01:11,696
You got natural luck.

705
01:01:24,364 --> 01:01:27,863
It. McAllister would
like to see you two.

706
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:30,297
[Scotty] Look, we
set out at dark

707
01:01:30,364 --> 01:01:32,330
with the wagons for Concho.

708
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,496
Chata's not likely to follow us

709
01:01:34,563 --> 01:01:36,163
till he's sure we're
not just trying

710
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,230
to feint him out of the canyon.

711
01:01:38,297 --> 01:01:39,896
He'll just scout us,

712
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:43,063
knowing he can catch us easy
enough when he's ready.

713
01:01:43,997 --> 01:01:45,997
After a couple of hours

714
01:01:46,997 --> 01:01:48,930
I'll shift direction...

715
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:52,330
strike straight for where
he's left his families.

716
01:01:52,397 --> 01:01:55,997
His scouts will race
back to report it.

717
01:01:56,063 --> 01:01:59,763
Chata will have to
come out to stop us.

718
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:03,197
Only by then, I'll have
changed direction again.

719
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:08,263
Circling back to
Diablo canyon...

720
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:10,563
getting there

721
01:02:10,629 --> 01:02:12,997
before Chata realizes
what's happened.

722
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:19,330
You might make general one day.

723
01:02:19,397 --> 01:02:22,263
Except he'll probably
leave some men

724
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:23,796
in the entrance to that canyon,

725
01:02:23,863 --> 01:02:26,030
just in case.

726
01:02:26,097 --> 01:02:28,364
That's something you'll
have to take care of

727
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:30,663
before you set out for Concho.

728
01:02:32,297 --> 01:02:35,529
You and the 4 best
men I've got left.

729
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,663
Toller?

730
01:02:41,763 --> 01:02:43,763
He's not under my orders.

731
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,163
But I'm thirsty, too

732
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,297
and I'm getting thirstier.

733
01:02:56,563 --> 01:02:58,830
[Ferguson] Troopers, mount up!
We're moving out!

734
01:02:58,896 --> 01:03:00,397
Dress on the wagons!

# [bugle playing]

736
01:03:01,896 --> 01:03:04,163
Let's move it!

737

[Ferguson] Flank the
first armor wagon!

738
01:03:06,263 --> 01:03:09,397
White, Hopkins, flank
the second armor wagon.

739
01:03:09,464 --> 01:03:11,197
It's time now, Mrs. Grange.

740
01:03:11,263 --> 01:03:13,364
[Ferguson] Avery, miller,
flank the freighter's wagon.

741
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:16,063
Bugler, drive point
behind the lieutenant!

742
01:03:21,629 --> 01:03:22,896
Help me mount, sergeant.

743
01:03:22,963 --> 01:03:24,529
Sir, are you sure you're able?

744
01:03:24,596 --> 01:03:25,896
Sergeant, I give the orders.

745
01:03:25,963 --> 01:03:27,230
Yes, sir.

746
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:43,130
Here.

747
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:06,796
Jess.

748
01:04:06,863 --> 01:04:08,997
As far as I'm concerned,

749
01:04:09,063 --> 01:04:11,696
your job's done when
you report to Concho.

750
01:04:12,696 --> 01:04:15,130
If Clay Dean's there...

751
01:04:15,197 --> 01:04:18,763
I'll not take it bad if you
don't return with col. Foster.

752
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,629
Oh, Scotty.

753
01:04:20,696 --> 01:04:22,397
Aye?

754
01:04:22,464 --> 01:04:25,629
Keep an eye on Ellen Grange
and her boy, will you?

755
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,330
You've got no luck, Jess.

756
01:04:32,529 --> 01:04:34,397
She's already married.

757
01:05:22,796 --> 01:05:25,496
"Welcome to your gory bed..."

758
01:05:25,563 --> 01:05:27,097

[Toller] Been over 2 hours.

761
01:05:49,896 --> 01:05:52,663
McAllister must've made
his first move by now.

762
01:06:14,063 --> 01:06:16,297
[Scotty] Now, we start
straight for the hills

763
01:06:16,364 --> 01:06:17,629

769
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:14,097

01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:15,963
I couldn't count.

771
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:17,896
They couldn't have
left too many behind.

772
01:07:57,197 --> 01:07:59,563
Turn back to the canyon!

773
01:07:59,629 --> 01:08:01,930

We keep on like this all the
way, these animals will die!

778

Get them lined up

heading out for Concho.

Sir, we only got
just 11 men left.

You.

815
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:11,397

to the canyon with...

Mr. Toller...

823

825
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,230
A few.

Look, I'm a damned
good sergeant, see...

827
01:15:39,364 --> 01:15:42,263
but I never fought
no Indians before.

828
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:44,063
I never even been west of St.
Louis

829
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:46,430
till I brought out this
bunch of recruits.

831
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:54,896
Get those horses back to the water.
They earned it.

832
01:15:54,963 --> 01:15:56,763
And get one of those ammo wagons

833
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:58,563
all the way back to the water

834
01:15:58,629 --> 01:16:00,464
so we can use it
for a last stand.

835
01:16:00,529 --> 01:16:03,863
The question now is whether we can
hold out until col. Foster gets here.

836

Suppose Remsberg gets caught?

837
01:16:06,663 --> 01:16:08,696
Remsberg ain't Harrington.

838
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:26,297
I don't much like the idea of
blowing up all this ammunition.

watch this whole rim up here.

call it quits.

that come from?

They're using arrows.
They're out of ammunition.

chances a stray bullet

847
01:17:58,197 --> 01:18:00,097

get out of here.

897
01:26:16,464 --> 01:26:18,696
[Colonel] Sergeant, mount up.

898
01:26:18,763 --> 01:26:20,629
[Man] Company, mount!

899
01:26:20,696 --> 01:26:22,596

[Horse neighing]

903
01:27:02,197 --> 01:27:03,896
We have to move back further.

904
01:27:03,963 --> 01:27:07,063
Yeah, they'll all be slipping
back in here now it's dark.

905
01:27:14,063 --> 01:27:16,130
We're pulling back, get moving.

906
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:17,963
Hold it.

907
01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:22,263
Anybody seen Grange?

908
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:23,330
Grange?

909
01:27:24,163 --> 01:27:25,364
Grange?

910
01:27:27,496 --> 01:27:28,496
Grange!

911
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:33,529
Grange!

912
01:27:48,563 --> 01:27:50,197
[Woman laughing]

913
01:28:04,263 --> 01:28:05,763
[Man] Who's that?

914
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:08,130
Jess Remsberg.

915
01:28:10,364 --> 01:28:12,563
Who the hell is Jess Remsberg?

916
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,297
Scout for col.
Foster at the fort.

917
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:20,263
All right.

918
01:28:26,730 --> 01:28:28,397
What do you want?

919
01:28:32,529 --> 01:28:34,030
You Clay Dean?

920
01:28:34,629 --> 01:28:35,730
Yeah.

921
01:28:36,496 --> 01:28:38,896
I need some information.

922
01:28:38,963 --> 01:28:40,430
It's important.

923
01:28:40,496 --> 01:28:41,896
Better be important to me.

924
01:29:02,596 --> 01:29:03,730
Well?

925
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:29,230
Where did you get that?

926
01:29:30,730 --> 01:29:32,663
I won it in a poker game.

927
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:34,730
Who did you win it from?

928
01:29:35,297 --> 01:29:36,297
Why?

929
01:29:36,364 --> 01:29:37,796
Who?

930
01:29:37,863 --> 01:29:40,529
First, you tell me why
you want to know.

931
01:29:44,496 --> 01:29:46,197
She was my wife.

932
01:29:46,263 --> 01:29:47,397
Oh.

933
01:29:49,464 --> 01:29:51,496
So that's it.

934
01:29:51,563 --> 01:29:55,230
No, you're not gonna find
out about him from me.

935
01:29:55,297 --> 01:29:58,163
I might tell him about you,
though, when I see him.

936
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:00,997
He did you a favor, mister.

937
01:30:01,063 --> 01:30:03,230
I ain't got nothing against
a man bedding down

938
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:06,230
with a pretty, young
Indian girl...

939
01:30:06,297 --> 01:30:08,330
but when you call one
of them your wife...

940
01:30:08,397 --> 01:30:10,364
tell me who you won it from.

941
01:30:13,796 --> 01:30:15,930
You can leave here
now, squaw man.

942
01:30:17,063 --> 01:30:18,596
Leave your gun belt.

943
01:30:20,997 --> 01:30:22,364
Take off that gun.

944
01:30:26,397 --> 01:30:27,496
Or use it.

945
01:30:48,297 --> 01:30:49,297
Ah!

946
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:52,097
[Grunting]

947
01:30:55,263 --> 01:30:56,730
[Whimpering]

948
01:30:58,730 --> 01:31:00,930
Now, tell me who you
won her hair from.

949
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:01,997
If I do?

950
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:04,364
If you do, marshal,
you go on living.

951
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:07,097
You've got yourself quite a
name as a bad man with a gun.

952
01:31:07,163 --> 01:31:09,230
Maybe you think you can
tell me any name at all,

953
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:10,696
then later come gunning for me.

954
01:31:10,763 --> 01:31:12,529
Is that what you're
thinking, marshal?

955
01:31:12,596 --> 01:31:15,364
No, I... [screaming]

956
01:31:17,796 --> 01:31:19,030
Well, now you know.

957
01:31:19,963 --> 01:31:22,930
You're not fast anymore.

958
01:31:22,997 --> 01:31:26,563
You give me the wrong name and
I'll come back and finish the job.

959
01:31:33,663 --> 01:31:34,896
Now who?

960
01:31:35,963 --> 01:31:39,063
He needed $10 to see my hand.

961
01:31:39,130 --> 01:31:42,197
Grange put up the scalp for it.
He was drunk and he...

962
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:43,696
did you say...

963
01:31:43,763 --> 01:31:46,430
Grange. A freighter.
Will Grange.

964
01:31:46,496 --> 01:31:48,863
He was telling how
he'd revenged his wife

965
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:51,197
on this Comanche
girl he'd caught.

966

967
01:32:06,863 --> 01:32:07,863
Ugh!

968
01:32:08,629 --> 01:32:10,730
Ah.

969
01:32:10,796 --> 01:32:14,330
Get inside the perimeter.
Get against the wall!

970
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:22,097
[Groaning]

971
01:32:23,397 --> 01:32:24,430
Get back!

972
01:32:24,496 --> 01:32:25,763
But he's alive!

973
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:33,263

[Baby crying]

978
01:32:57,796 --> 01:32:58,930
They're killing him.

979
01:32:58,997 --> 01:33:00,063
Not yet.

980
01:33:02,263 --> 01:33:03,930
It's an old trick.

981
01:33:05,863 --> 01:33:09,430
They saved him for this,
to work on our nerves.

982
01:33:10,364 --> 01:33:11,896
[Screaming continues]

983
01:33:11,963 --> 01:33:13,364
[Sobs] Oh, god.

"now and in the
hour of our death."

Ferguson!

990
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:51,230
It's time to collect
that dry brush

991
01:33:51,297 --> 01:33:53,796
and get it under
that ammo wagon.

992
01:33:53,863 --> 01:33:55,763
If they rush us,

993
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:57,963
that wagon better burn fast.

Mrs. Grange!

997
01:34:44,529 --> 01:34:46,563
Somebody's got to kill him.

998
01:34:46,629 --> 01:34:48,529
Put an end to what
they're doing.

999
01:34:48,997 --> 01:34:49,997
Ugh!

1000
01:34:51,830 --> 01:34:52,830
Mrs. Grange.

1001
01:35:02,796 --> 01:35:04,930
Give me the gun and get down.

1002
01:35:24,496 --> 01:35:25,529
No.

1003
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:30,230
Oh.

[Moaning]

1005
01:35:39,063 --> 01:35:41,997
It's all up to you now, Toller.

1006
01:35:42,063 --> 01:35:45,097
Don't let them get
the ammunition.

1007
01:35:45,163 --> 01:35:47,596
Chata won't get that ammunition

1008
01:35:47,663 --> 01:35:49,696
even if he wipes us out.

1009
01:35:49,763 --> 01:35:53,197
And he's lost too many men
against a force half his size.

1010
01:35:53,263 --> 01:35:55,030
And you did it.

1011
01:35:55,097 --> 01:35:56,130
No.

1012
01:35:57,930 --> 01:35:59,563
I killed most of my men.

1013
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:02,297
Chata had to be stopped
and you stopped him.

1014
01:36:02,364 --> 01:36:05,430
That's what the army's out
here to do, ain't it?

1015
01:36:06,796 --> 01:36:07,963
Is it?

1016
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:10,963
Yes.

1017
01:36:11,796 --> 01:36:13,063

You...

1021
01:36:27,997 --> 01:36:29,730
you tell them that...

[Grange screams]

1023
01:37:15,263 --> 01:37:17,830
You sure this is what you
want to do, Mrs. Grange?

1024
01:37:17,896 --> 01:37:19,863
I don't want him to die.

1025
01:37:21,097 --> 01:37:22,930
Chata will take care of him.

1026
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:26,563
And raise him as an Apache.

1027
01:37:26,629 --> 01:37:29,896
My people would never raise
him as one of their own.

1028
01:37:37,930 --> 01:37:39,796
They're getting
ready for the kill.

1029
01:37:39,863 --> 01:37:42,197
We better get back to the wagon.

1030
01:37:43,364 --> 01:37:44,997
Now, Mrs. Grange.

1031
01:37:51,263 --> 01:37:53,263
Mrs. Grange, let go now.

They're coming, all of them.

fire this wagon.
