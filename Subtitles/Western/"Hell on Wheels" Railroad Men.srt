Thomas, I won.

533
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:16,504
When those government inspectors
order you to rip up and rebuild

534
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,659
half the shoddy track you laid
either side of the 50 miles

535
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,694
you buttered up for Campbell,

536
00:37:22,695 --> 00:37:25,647
it'll cost you a hell of
a lot more than Ogden.

537
00:37:27,317 --> 00:37:29,968
And when those very same
inspectors look at your track,

538
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:33,138
half-spiked, half tied, held
together with a prayer,

539
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:35,974
they're gonna ask some
very tough questions,

540
00:37:35,975 --> 00:37:38,426
including what the hell have
you done with all their money?

541
00:37:40,564 --> 00:37:42,697
You'll land in jail over this.

542
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:46,113
I've been there before, Collis.
I'm willing to go back.

543
00:37:46,742 --> 00:37:47,741
Are you?

544
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:53,675
You're mad.

545
00:37:56,213 --> 00:37:57,579
Good night, Collis.

546
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:59,564
I'll give you half a million dollars.

547
00:37:59,565 --> 00:38:01,266
I don't want the money.

548
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:02,834
Three-quarters of a million dollar.

549
00:38:02,835 --> 00:38:04,369
Enjoy the festivities.

550
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,454
Oh, for Christ's sake, take it!

551
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:09,390
Take Ogden.

552
00:38:10,193 --> 00:38:13,692
If that will end this,
Thomas, by all means,

553
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:17,031
take it.

554
00:38:17,601 --> 00:38:20,552
But the ceremony happens at Promontory,

555
00:38:20,553 --> 00:38:22,154
on C.P. soil.

556
00:38:22,155 --> 00:38:24,055
And I keep all the government bonds.

557
00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:25,840
All two and a half
million dollars' worth.

558
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,080
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, Collis.

559
00:38:35,986 --> 00:38:37,285
Go to hell!

568
00:40:08,144 --> 00:40:09,510
but I own it.

569
00:40:09,846 --> 00:40:11,079
All of it.

570
00:40:12,515 --> 00:40:14,515
I made a deal with Huntington.

571
00:40:16,953 --> 00:40:18,152
Mmm.

572
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:22,690
I beat you.

573

574
00:40:28,732 --> 00:40:29,931
All right, Doc.

575
