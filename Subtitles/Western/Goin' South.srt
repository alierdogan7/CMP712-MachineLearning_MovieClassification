WHEN I CAME HOME

1423
01:44:36,803 --> 01:44:39,806
AND YOU WAS GONE,
HONEY.

1424
01:44:41,808 --> 01:44:43,944
LET ME HELP YOU UP.

1425
01:44:43,944 --> 01:44:44,811
OH!

1426
01:44:44,811 --> 01:44:46,313
THANK YOU, MOON.

1427
01:45:00,327 --> 01:45:03,830
I'M NOT SURE I'LL EVER
GET USED TO MEXICO.

1428
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:06,833
WHY, SURE, YOU WILL,
HONEY PIE.

1429
01:45:06,833 --> 01:45:10,337
YOU GOT USED TO ME,
DIDN'T YOU?

1430
01:45:10,337 --> 01:45:12,839
ANYWAYS...

1431
01:45:12,839 --> 01:45:16,843
FIRST, LET'S GET USED
TO BEING RICH.
