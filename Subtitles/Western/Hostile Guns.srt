00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:55,533
You gonna?

6
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:57,067
Yeah, I'm gonna.

7
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,433
Today?

8
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,333
Today.

9
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:03,067
Well, back pay
and everything?

10
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:05,967
Every last simoleon.

11
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:08,433
I think Uncle Joe
knows you're gonna.

12
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:10,567
So he knows.

13
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,300
You shouldn't
have told everybody
on the spread.

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,267
Then you could've
jumped him sudden
and surprise him,

15
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:18,300
And maybe
from behind.

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,067
It's no surprise.

17
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,667
Right to his ugly face.

18
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,367
Uncle Joe.

19
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,800
Uncle Joe, I got something
to tell you.

20
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,600
This here's
a free country.

21
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,467
If all the ugly people
in the world was thrown
in a heap...

22
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:42,567
You'd be on top.

23
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,933
I always liked the top.

24
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:49,067
You're meaner than a grizzly
with ticks in his ears.

25
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,267
I'm a grizzly bear,
all right.

26
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:54,733
You ain't got no more
milk of human kindness
than a tarantula.

27
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:58,233
And if you moved
into his tepee,

28
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,700
Even a drunken,
dog-robbin' Indian
would move out

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,267
'Cause he couldn't
stand the smell.

30
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:05,533
Uncle Joe, you stink.

31
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,167
Sticks and stones
may break my bones,

32
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,167
But names
will never hurt me.

33

34
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:15,767
Now you're goin'
too far, boy!

35
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:18,900
Six hundred
and forty-seven dollars.
Five years back pay.

36
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,633
My own flesh and blood!

37
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:23,133
Telling people
you took me in

38
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:25,567
Out of Christian kindness
when my folks died.

39
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:29,067
"Poor orphan nephew,"
you told around.

40
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,567
Why, I punched
1,000 cows for you

41
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,500
When it was so hot
you could fry an egg
on a rock.

42
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,433
Only you're too mean
and stingy to buy grain
to keep a few chickens.

43
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,500
And I punched 1,000 cows
in winters so cold,

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,367
You had to chip the ice
off a horse's back

45
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,500
Before you could
saddle up.

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,300
Now, I told you,
I want my money.

47
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,500
Six hundred and
forty-seven dollars,
right now!

48

Them's fightin' words, boy!

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,167
Why, you fat old pig,
that's what I'm getting at.

50
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:58,800
I come to fight
for my money.

51
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:03,267
Lord,
give me strength
to bear my load.

52
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,100
All right, boy.

53
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,967
I just ain't
got it in me

54
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:10,467
To strike my own
flesh and blood.

55
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,567
Come on in the house
and get your money.

56
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:14,267
You mean it?

57
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:21,433
This strong
right hand of mine
would wither

that's what he's got.

Horse or man,
its breedin' will tell.

66
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:58,533
Now, take this boy
to the bunkhouse

67
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:01,067
And care for him
tenderly.

Show some sense, boy.

may be addled
forever as it is.

that iron box

we tried
to explain to you...

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,100
You lose on seven
after you make
your first point.

for me, Ed?

into my place.

from gambling.

He don't know
a hit from a miss.

betting on the "do pass"

Are you calling me ignorant?

94

buck the table.

- Ja.

last trip.

like I see on the boats
in the old country.

what it is at that.

the lumber.

your consideration,

just sign the receipt

00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,600
I mean,
I know I was wrong.

180
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,233
I shouldn't
have acted
the way I did,

181
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,400
But you understand
I ain't scared of you,
don't you?

182
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,700
When I was your age,
it was real important

183
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,367
That nobody think
I was scared of anything.

184
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,733
Then I, uh,
I grew up.

185
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,600
Come on out.

186
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,433
I'm doing 10 days.

187
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,133
Or $50.

188
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:28,233
I'm offering you a job
that you can earn $100 on.

189
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,633
A hundred?

190
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,333
Also, you can get
yourself killed.

191
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:35,133
But of course, you're
not afraid of anything.

192
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:37,433
What do you
want me to do?

193
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,667
What I tell you to.

194
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:44,133
All right,
start telling.

195
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:46,633
Well, first you can
get us a couple
of cups of coffee.

196
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,567
You're Bill Reno's boy,
aren't you?

197
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:06,900
Yeah. Why?

198
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,233
I knew Bill.

199
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,633
Yeah, I hear you
whipped your Uncle Joe.

200
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,467
Yeah.

201
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:16,867
Made him holler uncle.

202
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:18,533
(CHUCKLES)

203
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:19,933
Aw, he must
be getting old.

204
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,700
The mean old
bull buffalo

205
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,333
Could've whipped
a dozen like you
in his prime.

206
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:29,800
He even whipped me once...

207
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,367
And I could always handle
at least 11 like you.

208
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,067
Coffee's good.

209
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,233
I just don't
make you out.

210
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:42,400
You'll grow.

211
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,767
You giving me
this break
because, uh...

212
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,467
'Cause you liked
my old man?

213
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:55,100
I heard a lot of lead
whistle while your pa
was at my elbow.

214
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,167
So I'm putting
a stack of chips

215
00:13:57,267 --> 00:14:00,933
On the proposition that
you're not all big mouth...

216
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:04,367
There's a streak
of man in you.

217
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:06,567
(CHUCKLES)

218
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:12,100
I guess I gotta take
that kind of talk
from you.

219
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,567
You're doing me
a big favor.

220
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,300
You don't have to take
anything from me

221
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,967
If you feel that
you're man enough
to handle it.

222
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,567
No luck on that
deputy thing.

223
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,267
Hey. He's supposed
to be in that cell.

224
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,600
Yeah, I know.

225
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,300
Well, I'm sorry
about the deputy.

226
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,233
- I got my dep.
- What?

227
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,933
He's it.

228
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,467
Are you crazy?

229
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:47,367
Well, possibly.

230
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:50,300
My ear sure hurts.
Know who belted me?

231
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,333
Yeah. I did.

232
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,400
Mike, would you
get the marshal
a cup of coffee?

233
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,867
Never mind.
I'll get it.

234
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:03,100
Mike, would you
take a look and see
what's outside?

235
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:11,233
How much
you paying him?

236
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,567
Oh, the usual.
100.

237
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,367
I know human nature.

238
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:21,067
I got another 100
that says that kid won't
come through for you.

239
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:23,200
I'll take that bet.

240
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,733
Might as well
load him up.

241
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:34,667
Never seen anything
like it before
in my life.

242
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,767
Yep.

243
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,267
What kind of a rig
do you call that?

244
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,733
Had it built special
right here
in San Carlos.

245
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,533
We got trouble.

246
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:56,500
He says he won't
leave that cell alive.

247
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,533
Afraid of hanging, huh?

248
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:01,333
Well, those kind
usually are.

249
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:05,200
Big, tough,
rough murderers,
afraid to die.

250
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,200
So that's why you
built that wagon.

251
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,367
And that's why you want me
to help you haul prisoners
to the pen in Huntsville.

252
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:14,667
- That's right.
- Why didn't you tell me?

253
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,233
You didn't ask me.

254
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,900
Say, McCool, if it's all
the same to you...

255
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:21,067
Well, it isn't the same.
You gave me your word.

256
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:23,167
All arrangements
have been made.

257
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:24,700
I'm notifying the warden
and the governor.

258
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,467
I don't figure you
for a welcher.

259
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,100
I wasn't figuring
on welching.

260
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,400
I just figure you can
get someone else.

261
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,767
Well, I'm sorry,
Mike, I can't.

262
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:36,933
Now, are you gonna
give us a hand?

263
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,700
Yeah.

264
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,067
All right.
Just don't take
any chances.

265
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,067
This prisoner's
a murderer.

266
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,367
Killed a 12-year-old boy,
among others.

267
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,067
So you got help,
did you?

268
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:56,233
Well, you'll need it.

269
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,533
You come in here,
somebody's
gonna die.

270
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:02,867
I'm warnin' you.
I'll kill you with my boots,

271
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:04,900
My hands,
my bare feet
if I have to.

272
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:11,300
All right, Pleasant, let's go.

273
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,500
You're next, boy.

274
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,900
I'll break you
like a stick.

275
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:25,467
Come on.
Come on.

276
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,900
I want to hear
your back snap.

277
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:38,667
(BOTH GRUNTING)

278
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:22,300
Get up!
Get up.

279
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,367
I ain't leavin'.
I ain't leavin'!

280
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:28,867
Get up!

281
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:30,700
You got those handcuffs?

282
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,567
(PANTING)

283
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,133
All right.

284
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,933
Well, he's earned
his money already.

285
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:03,700
(GRUNTING)

286
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Aah! Why don't you
just shoot me here?

287
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,933
I don't want to hang!

288
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,200
We might just
oblige, Pleasant.

289
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,667
Now, you come on.
Climb aboard.

290
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,867
Thanks for
softening him up.

291
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,900
You behave yourself,
Pleasant, for
a couple of days,

292
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:29,467
And I'll fit you
to a nice comfortable
Oregon boot.

293
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:32,833
Ain't no such thing
as a comfortable
leg iron.

294
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,367
Thanks, Marshal.

295
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,700
Good luck, kid.
Wire me when
you get there.

296
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,500
That 100 I'm paying
the kid looks mighty safe,
doesn't it?

297
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,567
I wouldn't be
in his boots
for 1,000.

298
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:07,033
I'll see you
when I pick up the 100.

299
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:10,633
Looks like they
give old cousin Hank
a good pastin'.

300
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:14,667
Nobody does
that to my brother.

301
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:17,167
Took all of 'em,
for sure.

302
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:19,367
Yeah, all of them.

303
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:20,500
Shoot.

304
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,733
Somewhere between
here and Huntsville,

305
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,500
We're gonna
spring Cousin Hank
from that wagon.

306
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,767
In the meantime,
let's pay a call
on that marshal

307
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,933
That helped them
gang up
on Brother Hank.

308
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:06,933
Afternoon,
gentlemen.

309
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,867
I understand strangers
have to check their guns
when they're in town?

310
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:12,433
That's right.
Here, I'll take them.

311
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:15,900
Oh!

312
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,967
Sure parted his hair,
Cousin Aaron.

313
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:22,600
He got off easy.

314
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:29,733
Where you figuring
on camping tonight?

315
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,767
That little valley
looks good.

316
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:34,700
I need some water.

317
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,500
Drink?

318
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:47,800
Got any whiskey?

319
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:57,533
- I'll lead
the way out.
- All right.

320
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,067
(WHISTLES)

321
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,767
They're movin' again.

322
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,433
Your blanket's
right over here,
Pleasant.

323
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:30,100
Sorry you didn't
find my food
too appetizing.

324
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,533
The thought of hangin'
kind of takes
my appetite.

325
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:38,067
Never could understand
that "hearty breakfast"
stuff about prisoners.

326
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,100
Neither could I.

327
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,533
You bed down
over there.

328
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,567
How do you feel?

329
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,167
I'm all right.
A little sleepy.

330
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,900
Hey, hold on there.

331
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:52,067
What do you think
I've got you along for?

332
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:53,733
You expecting trouble?

333
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,967
Yeah. Any prison wagon
is trouble.

334
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,600
All the time.

335
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,600
On every trip.

336
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,167
Now, there are those
that would spring a prisoner

337
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:04,700
If they could just for laughs.

338
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,233
Then there are the others
that are relatives,
friends that...

339
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:12,433
Well, they're just bent
on beating the law
out of what's theirs.

340
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,767
So one of us
has to stay awake.

341
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:16,433
Yeah, that's right.

342
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:18,133
You can take
the first watch.

343
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:22,400
Yeah, right up
between those two rocks,
that looks pretty good.

344
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,700
That way you can see
anybody coming up,

345
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,700
And they can't take
a free shot at you.

346
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,700
Better keep this fire
going, too.

347
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,667
I'll spell you
in about four hours.

348
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:34,933
Oh, by the way,
I'll be in the wagon.

349
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:38,067
That way, the prisoner
won't be able to tell
whether I'm watching or not.

350
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,300
I can take
that fella
on the horse.

351
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,467
Suppose you
just wound him.
Suppose you miss him.

352
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:32,467
They'll kill Hank.

353
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:35,367
And we'd be in
for a wing-ding fight.

354
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,733
Time and place
ain't right yet.

355
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:39,533
Gotta get 'em both.
We gotta be sure.

356
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,500
Well, we're still
ahead of 'em.

357
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:26,300
She ain't been by yet.

358
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,633
Looks like we'll have
some waiting.

359
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,967
If you like, you can
get out and stretch.

360
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:34,267
You heard him.
Get on out.

361
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:39,267
Saw some prairie hens
about a quarter mile back.

362
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,100
Maybe we can scare up
a few around here.

363
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,967
Yeah.
We can roast 'em.

364
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:44,833
I like mine fried.

365
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:05,167
They're splitting up.

366
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:06,733
Now we can take them.

367
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:12,100
Get him
on the first shot.

368
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,833
No need to worry
about the other one.

369
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:40,067
- He's headed
right this way.
-(GUN COCKING)

370
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:42,300
That makes it easy.
Just leave him to me.

371
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,600
Shoot him
in the belly.

372
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,700
I want him
to die hard.

373
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,133
You head around to the wagon
and kill the other one.

374
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,500
(CLUCKING)

375
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:07,733
(CONTINUES CLUCKING)

376
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,600

(STAGECOACH APPROACHING)

378
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:40,267
McCool?

379
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:42,367
He'll be along.
My name's Reno.

380
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,667
All right.
Everybody out, gentlemen.

381
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,967
Hurry it up.

382
00:28:50,067 --> 00:28:51,467
Transfer to
the Huntsville wagon.

383
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:52,700
Come on. Move.

384
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,700
Amigo,
it's a privilege.

385
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,233
The name is
Angel Dominguez.

386
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:00,500
Hello, Angel. They, uh,
clipped your wings, huh?

387
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,733
Ah, si.

388
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,367
- McCool?
- That's right.

389
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:05,267
I'm Travis.
I brought your prisoners.

390
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:08,900
Sign.

391
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:12,200
R.C. Crawford,
Angel Dominguez.

392
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,533
There you are.

393
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:18,200
Here's the key.

394
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:21,200
You Crawford?

395
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,267
R.C. Crawford
is the name.

396
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:24,600
This is a disgrace...

397
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,733
A railroad commissioner
shackled to a goat stealer.

398
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,467
Someone will pay for this.

399
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,467
All right, Mike.

400
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:37,833
Water 'em down,
fit 'em with a Oregon boot,
and get 'em loaded.

401
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,167
It's a good thing
you didn't shoot.

402
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:53,967
That sure was close.

403
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:56,533
Now, you remember
about that Gid.

404
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:58,533
He's the best gun
in 10 states.

405
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,967
He would've been
the best dead gun
in 10 states

406
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,167
If that stage
hadn't shown up.

407
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:07,567
People tried to take
prisoners away from him
before and they died.

408
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,033
Maybe with more prisoners
to look after,

409
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:16,367
We'll have a better chance
to get at him.

410
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,533
How's it going?

411
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:22,100
Well, no problem...
So far.

412
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:25,567
Could that be
Mike Reno?

413
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,467
Could be.

414
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:29,733
Heard about him.

415
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:32,067
Kind of
hot to handle, isn't he?

416
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:34,667
Well, we got a
hot prisoner along.

417
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,233
Sort of
evens things out.

418
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:38,667
Hank Pleasant.

419
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:41,533
- That's right.
- Good luck.

420
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,067
Only luck you have
with the likes of him

421
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:45,767
Or any other prisoners
is to keep 'em in chains.

422
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:47,800
All safe and secure, huh?

423
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,200
You betcha.

424
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:55,633
Senor Sheriff,

425
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:57,967
My guitarra, por favor.
Please. My guitarra.

426
00:30:58,067 --> 00:31:00,067
All right, Pleasant.

427
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:01,833
Climb aboard.

428
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:07,100
(EXCLAIMING IN SPANISH)

429
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:15,267
I hope it's all right.

430
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:17,600
- I'm kind of partial to music.
- Gracias, senor.

431
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:20,800
You've got company,
Pleasant.

432
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:25,600
Ain't you gonna
help me up, too?

00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,400
Anybody laughs
at Hank Pleasant
loses their teeth.

435
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
But, senor Pleasant,
I didn't mean to.

436
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,133
I'm only a happy Mexican.

437

All right, Pleasant.

438
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,200
Remember,
they're your guests.

439
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,100
Of course.
Take it easy, my friend.

440
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,467

442
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,067

in this state...

443
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,100
Connections.
I can help you.

444
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,633
What are you here for,
the ride?

445
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:02,467
Enemies, political enemies
who stooped
to the lowest tactics

446
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:05,200
To bring R.C. Crawford down,
but...

447
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,667
R.C. Crawford
will rise again.

448
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,867
We all gonna have a nice time.

449
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:15,833
Amigos, my heart is so happy
that I am almost sad.

450
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:19,100
He's been talkin' like
that ever since
we left the jail.

451
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,700
Sometimes I envy him.

452
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,867
Just so he keeps it
to himself.

They should camp
the other side of
stone junction tonight.

00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:47,900
- We'll get 'em tomorrow.
- Yeah.

If it were convenient,
I'd buy you a drink.

461

Maybe I can
arrange that.

462
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:24,900
If that means violence,
count me out.

463

R.C. Crawford uses this.

464
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,933
You know, senor,
I am the same way.

465
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:31,800
My head rules me.

466

Sometimes
my heart takes over,
but I'm always sorry.

that ruled you

- You just cool off.
- He was makin' fun of me!

gonna hang me.

gonna reach Huntsville.

about my cousin Tico.

They come
from all over.

he even charged
admission.

00:34:57,467 --> 00:34:59,067
Will you shut up?

496
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,600
It seems so barbaric.

497
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,100
They let my cousin Tico
say his last few words.

00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:08,733
He say he was very happy
that so many people came.

It make feel him
very important.

502
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:14,467
One more word.

503
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:18,367
He had very seldom
ever felt important before.

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,367
(WHISTLES)

506
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:51,933
Whoa. Whoa.

507
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:03,700
Keep an eye on 'em.

Sorry to
inconvenience you,
gentlemen.

making a stop
at Stone Junction.

You just might have
some friends there.

511
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:20,733
Indeed I do, Constable.
I have friends
everywhere.

512
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:23,867
They will be shocked at
this shoddy treatment.

513
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:27,400
The reward
for five years
of public service.

514
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,067
A reward?
For why such
a strange reward?

515
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:34,400
Because those big brains
of his weren't working
quite fast enough.

The greatest brain
is of no avail

and broken promises,

518
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:43,667
But this gross wrong
will soon be righted.

Only one year.
Like my uncle,

521
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:49,867
I learn to be a cook
in the prison kitchen.

522
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:53,200
Then maybe I can get
a job in Huntsville.

523
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,067
Amigos, this is
a big privilege

Whoa.

527
00:37:43,867 --> 00:37:45,800
Keep an eye on 'em.
I'll go in and
get the prisoner.

528
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,633
Hope we have to
make no more stops
after we leave this place.

and Huntsville

and sagebrush.

00:38:00,133 --> 00:38:01,933
It's the ugliest place
I ever seen.

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,233
So many friendly people.

Someday I'll have one,
my friend.

538

will be shouting,

when you get there.

very well.

I'm only from a

But I know what you mean.

647
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:32,967
So she's the one
who killed Weddington, huh?

648
00:44:33,867 --> 00:44:35,567
Good for you, Duchess.

649
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:38,200

with gumption.

I'm not sure that it took
gumption, Miss Manon.

As long as they don't
hurt other people,
but he did.

658
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:07,067
Yeah, I remember
once I hired out
to help bust up a press,

659

Burn down a newspaper office.

660
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:10,767
I heard that Weddington
paid for the job.

661
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:14,300
The newspaper probably
printed something
he didn't like.

662
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,967
Could've been
50 different people
killed Weddington.

663
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:19,200
You had to take the blame
for killing a slob like him.

664
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,767
I know how you feel.

665
00:45:20,867 --> 00:45:23,867
How would you know?
You've been killing
since you were 15.

666
00:45:23,967 --> 00:45:25,967
Yeah, but this time
I was railroaded.

667
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:27,400
How did I know
it was a kid?

668
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,967
It was dark.
I thought he was
coming after me.

669
00:45:30,067 --> 00:45:34,767
I think if any of us
was railroaded,
it was Miss Manon.

670
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:38,500
Yeah. Me and her both.

671
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,300
And the jurors' wives
belonged to

672
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,433
If they'd brought back
a verdict of not guilty,

673
00:45:46,533 --> 00:45:48,333
Their old ladies
would've locked 'em out.

674

yelling at her.

a little too hard

On somebody's toes or neck.

678
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,733
A bullet fixes that,
and then they find
somebody convenient...

679
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:08,700
In this case,
Miss Manon...

680
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,333
To throw to the lions.

It don't seem right,
you know?

killing her man
in a quarrel of love?

687

you've missed the point.

692
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:46,133
How about telling us

something else?

00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:52,333
Sorry. It sometimes
helps to talk.

695
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:55,667
He ought to know.
That's all he ever does...
talk, talk, talk.

696
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:58,967
Senorita, I will
do something
better for you.

697
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:01,800
I will sing you
a song so sad

698
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,833
That you will feel happy.

699
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:06,833
Thank you, Angel.
I'd love to hear one.

700
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:08,067
Si, senorita.

701

(CONTINUES SINGING IN SPANISH)

706
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:40,267
Si, amigo.

707
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,967
Yeah, this is the place.

708
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,667
(WHISTLES)

709
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:15,533
Got about another hour.

710
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:18,567
Yeah, we'll make camp
the other side
of that hill.

711
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:23,833
Would you like
a drink, ma'am?

712
00:48:23,933 --> 00:48:25,833
No, thank you,
Mr. Reno.

713
00:48:25,933 --> 00:48:29,500
Real thoughtful
when it comes to
a pretty gal, ain't you?

714
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,833
He's only being
a gentleman, senor.

715
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:34,733
You heroes
and your tin stars,
all alike.

716
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:36,267
Either pushing
somebody around

717
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:38,667
Or makin' a play
for a poor gal
who can't help herself.

718
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:40,767
How can you
say that, amigo?

719
00:48:40,867 --> 00:48:42,367
He only...

720
00:48:42,467 --> 00:48:44,367
For the last time,
goat thief,
don't talk to me.

721
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:45,567
MCCOOL: Pleasant!

722
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:52,167
Pleasant, you're
not only a coward,
you're a dirty liar.

723
00:48:52,267 --> 00:48:54,067
Pleasant!

724
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:56,367
I warned you
about laying hands
on the prisoner.

725
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:58,067
What did I tell ya?
Gangin' up on me.

726
00:48:58,167 --> 00:49:00,933
McCool, as a personal
favor, let big mouth
out of that wagon.

727
00:49:01,067 --> 00:49:04,900
I've got a feeling he'd rather
have you let the lady prisoner
out of the wagon, Marshal.

728
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,733
I'll let out
some of your blood.

729
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,600
Mike.

730
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,233
Now I'm gonna have to
warn you about laying hands
on the prisoner.

731
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,867
Besides, you've
already taken him once.

732
00:49:15,967 --> 00:49:18,167
Yeah, and I ain't about
to forget that.

733
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:20,400
I told you
I'd cause trouble.

734
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,100
He isn't trouble.
He's just hot air.

735
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,700
It'll all be over

736
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,100
When they take that
little rope and put it
around your neck.

737
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,133
(VOCALIZING)
And hang you.

738
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,400
See what I mean?

739
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,533
You give 'em a badge,
they ain't human.

740
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:32,367
Anyone ever
call you human?

741
00:49:32,467 --> 00:49:34,367
You button your lip
or I'll fatten it for you.

742
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:36,833
McCool,
he's beggin' for it.

743
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:39,700
Mike, you just...
You just simmer down.

744
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,767
Remember, we're supposed
to deliver him in one piece.

745
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:45,667
(URGES HORSE)

746
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:08,000
This is gonna make
a turkey shoot look easy.

(LAUGHING)

748
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:12,233
Yep.

749
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,567
One thing R.C. Crawford
will never be
out of is cigars.

750
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:26,167
One thing R.C. Crawford
will never be out of is bull.

751
00:50:26,267 --> 00:50:31,033
My friends will see
that I'm supplied until
the day I prove my innocence.

752
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:34,267
You're guilty as hell,
and you know it.

753
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,433
There'll be appeals.

754
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,933
Whoa.

755
00:51:39,367 --> 00:51:41,167
Do you know
where that road
could wash out?

756
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,067
There's a wash
about three miles ahead.

757
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:46,667
Sure like to
take a look at it.

758
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:51,133
There was a cloudburst
around here a week past.

759
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,167
Must be it.

760
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:55,467
Funny lookin' tracks.

761
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:59,267
Indian sled,
maybe carretas.

762
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:01,433
You, uh...

763
00:52:01,533 --> 00:52:03,133
You know where
that detour goes?

764
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:06,867
Well, it must go
through that canyon.

765
00:52:09,467 --> 00:52:11,700
Well, what do you think?

766
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,833
I think we're acting
like a couple of old hens
with one chick.

767
00:52:14,933 --> 00:52:16,067
Let's go.

768
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,200
(WHISTLING)

769
00:52:38,233 --> 00:52:39,633
Hey, Aaron.

770
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,600
I see something.

771
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:04,133
Yeah, it's them.

772
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:26,900
- Say, McCool,
you notice that...
- Yeah, I know.

773
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:30,333
Something happened
to the sleigh tracks.

774
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:34,933
Maybe the, uh,
Indians camped off the trail.

775
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:37,233
Maybe that's what
they want us to think.

776
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,767
Could be
it wasn't Indians.

777
00:53:39,867 --> 00:53:42,267
You're sayin'
every now and then
on these trips someone...

778
00:53:42,367 --> 00:53:44,433
Tries to
set up a bushwhack?

779
00:53:44,533 --> 00:53:46,167
Yeah, every now and then.

780
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:49,800
I better take
a little look around.

781
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,800
Better stay within
hollerin' distance.

782
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:26,933
Sorry, lady and gents.

783
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:28,433
There'll be
a slight delay

784
00:54:28,533 --> 00:54:30,500
While the brakeman
inspects the roadbed.

785
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,633
I resent that allusion
to a railroad.

786
00:54:33,733 --> 00:54:36,667
I'm sorry, Commissioner.

787
00:54:36,767 --> 00:54:39,667
Do we have to keep
these shackles on?

788
00:54:39,767 --> 00:54:42,100
Right now,
I'm afraid so.

789
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,633
(SIGHS) Well,
I'm sure
you know best.

790
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:48,633
Why don't you
try to butter the man up,
Duchess?

791

(LAUGHING)

792
00:55:18,567 --> 00:55:20,900

at the last minute.

795
00:55:30,867 --> 00:55:32,400
You plugged him
somewhere for sure.

796
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,733
I ain't so all
sure about that.

797
00:55:40,733 --> 00:55:41,767
Hyah!

798
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,833
(GUNSHOT)

799
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,800
Pretty smart
for a lawman.

800
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,233
I want to get him
in the belly.

801
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:08,167
You can still take him,
cousin.

802
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,700
You know what that is?

803
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,633
Relatives of mine.

804
00:56:14,733 --> 00:56:17,100
We'll be
leavin' here soon.

805
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,833
Some of us, anyway.

806
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,667
You're going with me,
Duchess.

807
00:56:24,767 --> 00:56:26,867
I'll make you forget
that fancy Dan you killed.

(GUNFIRE)

809
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,133
He ain't got
no fair shot at us,
not where he is.

810
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:46,067
We got him
pinned down good.

811
00:56:46,133 --> 00:56:48,133
Let's finish him off
before the other one
gets here.

812
00:56:48,233 --> 00:56:49,400
Get around him.

816
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,467
Did you break
a bone?

817
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:21,833
No, but it sure
tore things up.

818
00:57:21,933 --> 00:57:23,800
We'll never
make it, Ned.
Not now.

819
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:27,200
I sure hate
to leave old Hank.

820
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,800
We'll get over to Dos Rios.
Some of the family
are there.

821
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,333
We can still head off
that wagon a day
out of Huntsville.

822
00:57:32,433 --> 00:57:33,700
Give me a hand.

823
00:57:36,467 --> 00:57:38,233
(VOICE ECHOING) Mike!

824
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:39,500
(VOICE ECHOING) Over here!

825
00:57:53,733 --> 00:57:56,533
Looks like there were
two of them.

826
00:57:56,633 --> 00:57:57,900
I hit one.

827
00:58:00,233 --> 00:58:01,933
You don't look any too much
the worse for wear.

828
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:04,800
A few bumps and scratches
where my horse pulled me.

829
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,633
Who do you suppose
they were?

830
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,933
They were probably friends
of Pleasant.

831
00:58:09,067 --> 00:58:11,833
Crawford's pretty sure
about his connections.

832
00:58:11,933 --> 00:58:13,733
Don't overlook
Miss Manon.

833
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:17,533
She probably has friends
who'd give their eye teeth
to deliver her.

834
00:58:17,633 --> 00:58:19,700
I can't say
I blame them.

835
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,067
You on her side?

836
00:58:22,133 --> 00:58:24,833
It just doesn't seem right
that she should do time

837
00:58:24,933 --> 00:58:28,567
For killin' some
pigheaded crook.

838
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:30,667
You've been listening
to Crawford.

839
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:33,233
The things he said
about this Weddington
or whatever his name was,

840
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:35,133
You know,
the guy she killed.

841
00:58:35,233 --> 00:58:36,500
Yeah...

842
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,667
It could be
that Crawford was lying,
didn't even know him.

843
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,833
What you're saying is
that the law's perfect.

844
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:44,833
She's guilty
and should be put away.

845
00:58:45,633 --> 00:58:47,700
Well, now, not exactly.

846
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,500
You're saying that
she shouldn't be.

847
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,400
I'm not saying anything.

848
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,767
I can think what I want to.

849
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,600
No more shoots.
Maybe no more bullets.

850
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,600
Maybe they're both dead.

851
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,767
Oh, no, senor.
Here they come.

852
00:59:06,867 --> 00:59:09,067
The other men
must be dead.

853
00:59:11,233 --> 00:59:13,267
Well, I ain't dead.

854
00:59:22,067 --> 00:59:24,300
I'm making
my own break.

855
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,067
Crawford, for a price,
I'll take you along.

856
00:59:28,367 --> 00:59:30,267
No charge for you,
Duchess.

857
00:59:37,067 --> 00:59:40,200

I'll let bygones
be bygones.

858
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,633
You go, too.

859
00:59:41,733 --> 00:59:44,167
Just keep your mouth shut.

860
00:59:44,267 --> 00:59:45,700
This goes
for all of you.

861
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,267
We might just
as well settle here
for the night.

862
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,300
That shot
got any closer,

863
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,400
Might've settled
here forever.

864
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,333
Well, you'll be able
to relax now.

865
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,900
We'll make camp here.

- Look out!

868
01:00:22,633 --> 01:00:24,933
Uh!

869
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:30,367
No, I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction of a bullet.

870
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:39,433
Angel, Miss Manon,

871
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:41,833
I could almost
forgive you two for that.

872
01:00:43,233 --> 01:00:45,033
I'm sorry
for your sake, senor.

873
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,567
Well done, McCool.

874
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,133
I had a little help.

875
01:00:58,067 --> 01:00:59,700
Might as well
build a fire.

877
01:01:16,267 --> 01:01:17,567
Hey, Angel.

878
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,667
Thanks for taking off
the shackles.

879
01:01:33,767 --> 01:01:36,867
I don't think
you'd be going anywhere.

880
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:39,267
Wouldn't get far
if I tried.

881
01:01:40,467 --> 01:01:42,100

seems to be enjoying
the rest of the weary.

884
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:52,200
He'll need it.

885
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,067
He takes
the next watch.

886
01:01:55,267 --> 01:01:56,733
He's very nice.

887
01:01:57,933 --> 01:01:59,467
He said the same for you.

888
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:04,300
He's quite young, isn't he?

889
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,867
Makes him susceptible
to female charms.

890
01:02:08,733 --> 01:02:10,200
But you aren't?

891
01:02:11,767 --> 01:02:13,967
At one time.

892
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:18,167
I know.
If only things
had been different.

893
01:02:19,933 --> 01:02:23,500
Yeah. Same old story.

894
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,200
Oldest story
in the world.

895
01:02:26,067 --> 01:02:27,233
If only.

896
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:32,333
Yep.

897
01:02:33,633 --> 01:02:35,633
My if only's different.

898
01:02:42,867 --> 01:02:44,933
It goes something like this.

899
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,700
If only she hadn't
been what she was.

900
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:53,567
Did it really matter?

901
01:02:55,367 --> 01:02:57,167
Well, that's what
I found out later...

902
01:02:57,267 --> 01:02:59,367
That it really
didn't matter.

903
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:04,300
But I suppose
your hurt pride
drove her away, hmm?

904
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:09,633
Oh, if only you hadn't
said the things to her
that you did say.

905
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,933
I said them.

906
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,833
Did you look for her?

907
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,933
When something
like that happens, you...
You stop looking.

908
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,433
You might have met
someone, uh, better.

909
01:03:27,733 --> 01:03:30,433
I might have,
but I didn't.

910
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,967
You hurt pretty bad.

911
01:03:35,967 --> 01:03:37,767
In one way or another.

912
01:03:41,867 --> 01:03:43,500
Look, Miss Manon,

913
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:49,733
If you're thinking, uh,
about getting around me,
it won't work.

914
01:03:59,433 --> 01:04:02,067
All right, let's
get 'em rolling.

915
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,067
You got these irons on
too tight.

916
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:05,700
You're breaking my heart.

917
01:04:06,967 --> 01:04:09,467
- Mornin'.
- Good morning.

918
01:04:09,567 --> 01:04:10,800
Sleep good?

919
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,833
Yes. Very well,
thank you.

920
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:14,233
Right here.

921
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,733
Didn't ask me
how I slept.

922
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:26,700
With a headache,
I assume.

923
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,500
Somehow I don't
think he cares.

924
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,867
True, senor, true.

925
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,433
You, Dominguez,
I am going to kill.

926
01:04:33,533 --> 01:04:36,100
Sure. Same way
you killed the constable.

927
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,267
Always he try
to kill somebody.

928
01:04:39,867 --> 01:04:44,300
You're a smart girl,
playing up to the deputy.

929
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,533
I don't know what
you're talking about.

930
01:04:50,733 --> 01:04:54,400
You, uh, worried
about those bushwhackers
that hit us yesterday?

931
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,467
Some.

932
01:04:56,567 --> 01:04:58,533
I know somebody
you worried.

933
01:04:58,633 --> 01:05:01,067
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

Marshal Willett
back at San Carlos.

935
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,967
He said I was
making a mistake
in hiring you.

936
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,733
What made him think so?

937
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:13,567
Said he was
a good judge
of character.

938
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:16,433
For some reason or
other, had you pegged
as bad medicine.

939
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,067
Even bet me cash
that you'd get me
into trouble.

940
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,267
I covered that bet.

941
01:05:24,367 --> 01:05:27,133
Said I was as good
a judge of character
as he was.

got anything to say
about it.

the whole place
over to you.

hasn't been too much

be over tomorrow.

minded it too much.

going to be like.

do any time.

the firing pin
in McCool's gun.

it looks.

1041
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:01,933
It never is.

1042
01:13:02,067 --> 01:13:03,333
You've got
to believe me this time.

1043
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:04,900
Why?

1044
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:07,067
Ask him.

1045
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:11,900
Nothing has changed.
The same game.

1046
01:13:12,067 --> 01:13:14,767
Why didn't you say
something about it?

1047
01:13:14,867 --> 01:13:18,067
We decided back
in the jail that it'd be
better not to.

1048
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,267
Gid, Mike and I just...

1049
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:28,633
I just wanted to be
free. I don't want
to go to jail.

1050
01:13:28,733 --> 01:13:31,667
Surely you can
understand that.

1051
01:13:31,767 --> 01:13:34,567
I shot Weddington
in self-defense.

1052
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:36,100
He was going to kill me.

1053
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,233
That's what
you told the jury.

1054
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:40,533
I shouldn't have
to serve time.

1055
01:13:40,633 --> 01:13:42,067
I agree.

1056
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,067
The judge
thought different.

1057
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:49,633
Look, I don't care
when you knew her or
why or how. That's past.

1058
01:13:49,733 --> 01:13:53,233
Now I say she isn't gonna
do time in some prison.

1059
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:56,967
My orders read,
"Deliver the prisoners."

1060
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,500
I'd better take
that gun belt.

1061
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,733
Now.

1062
01:14:21,967 --> 01:14:23,633
They will
kill each other.

1063
01:14:24,933 --> 01:14:27,233
If they don't,
I will.

1064
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:29,400
(GRUNTING)

1065
01:14:37,067 --> 01:14:40,233
They're fighting
like a couple
of animals.

1066
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:42,700
The winner gets
the girl.

1067
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,567
They don't know it yet,
but I'm gonna be
the winner.

1068
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,067
They do not see
Senor Pleasant.

1069
01:15:28,167 --> 01:15:29,833
Good. Maybe
he'll kill them both,

1070
01:15:29,933 --> 01:15:32,100
Then we'll get away,
the four of us.

1071
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,900
But... But you
are innocent.

1072
01:15:35,067 --> 01:15:36,400
There were appeals
for you.

1073
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,233
There are no appeals.
I'm not innocent.

1074
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:43,800
But senor, you told us
that you were innocent,
and you're guilty?

1075
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:51,533
(GRUNTING)

1076
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:11,400
You're not the first
to let a woman make
a fool out of you.

1077
01:16:13,067 --> 01:16:15,867
This isn't gonna
change anything.

1078
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:19,567
You're gonna make
the rest of the trip
in shackles.

1079
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:21,833
Let go of him.

1080
01:16:22,933 --> 01:16:24,967
Get up there.

1081
01:16:25,067 --> 01:16:26,633
Don't make me shoot.

1082
01:16:28,267 --> 01:16:30,267
You go right ahead.

1083
01:16:38,067 --> 01:16:40,633
(SHACKLES CLINKING)

1084
01:16:40,733 --> 01:16:45,400
I know you think
you're still right.

1085
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,967
You get the chance,
you'd probably
try it again.

1086
01:16:50,067 --> 01:16:53,233
Well, you're not
gonna be getting
a chance.

1087
01:16:55,067 --> 01:16:56,800
You think
she likes you.

1088
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:59,833
She was just conning you.

1089
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:08,433
McCool, here's your rifle.

1090
01:17:14,067 --> 01:17:16,067
You should've used it.

1091
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:19,333
You knew I wouldn't.

1092
01:17:19,433 --> 01:17:21,600
You killed one man.

1093
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:22,667
If you'd have used it,

1094
01:17:22,767 --> 01:17:25,967
You two could've
been out of here
by now.

1095
01:17:26,067 --> 01:17:28,500
Why don't you
leave me alone, Marshal?

1096
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,967
Get your bracelets on,
Honey.

1097
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,600
All right, you,
get over here.

1098
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,567
Can I make breakfast,
Senor McCool?

1099
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:49,500
There'll be no time
for breakfast.
We're too late now.

1100
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,567
All right,
let's get aboard.

1101
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:03,533
I'm sorry, Angel.

1102
01:18:03,633 --> 01:18:06,300
Sorry I didn't thank you
for yesterday.

1103
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,800
Well, thank you
for thanking me,
senor.

1104
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:14,100
You know, I was thinking,
when we get to the prison,

1105
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,700
I'll talk to the warden
about you.

1106
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,933
Senor Constable,

1107
01:18:19,067 --> 01:18:22,233
If you can only
get me a job
in the prison kitchen.

1108
01:18:22,333 --> 01:18:24,933
That's not exactly what
I was thinking about.

1109
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:26,900
I was thinking
maybe the warden would...

1110
01:18:27,067 --> 01:18:30,600
Would write to the governor
and they'd get you
a pardon.

1111
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:34,567
That would mean
they would not let me
stay in prison?

1112
01:18:34,667 --> 01:18:38,233
That's right.
You'd be able to get out.

1113
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:40,067
Oh, no, senor,
that's no good,

1114
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:42,400
Not until I learn
to cook.

1115
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:45,167
It would be no good
if I could not cook

1116
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:47,267
So I can get a job
in the big city.

1117
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,067
We'll see, Angel.

1118
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:54,933
Pleasant!

1119
01:18:56,967 --> 01:19:00,833
One thing I'll say
for you, you sure never
give up trying.

1120
01:19:00,933 --> 01:19:03,733
Now get in
the wagon.

1121
01:19:19,267 --> 01:19:22,233
(WHISTLES)

1122
01:19:24,633 --> 01:19:28,067
See, Mike,
I am trouble.

1123
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:31,067
I'm not complaining.

1124
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:34,300
Thanks for trying.

1125
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,233
It ain't over yet.

1126
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:37,733
We'll be in Huntsville
tonight.

1127
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:39,600
We still got
a few miles to go.

1128
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:42,867
If your kin
do liberate us,

1129
01:19:42,967 --> 01:19:45,300
Are you still going
to take me with you?

1130
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,367
But Senor Crawford
told me he was guilty.

1131
01:19:48,467 --> 01:19:50,867
R.C. Crawford guilty?

1132
01:19:50,967 --> 01:19:53,067
A crook? No.

1133
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,067
I'm a desperate man,
Mr. Pleasant.

1134
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,633
Mr. Pleasant.

1135
01:19:57,733 --> 01:20:00,300
Don't make me beg.

1136
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,600
They liberate us,
I'm going to put you
out of your misery.

1137
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,867
A bullet right through
your big fat mouth.

1138
01:20:25,433 --> 01:20:30,067
Bunco, I'm right glad
that you and Alfie agreed
to come along with us.

1139
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:31,633
Shucks, Aaron,

1140
01:20:31,733 --> 01:20:34,300
Me and Alfie's
been beholden
to Hank Pleasant

1141
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,567
For more years
than we can remember.

1142
01:20:36,667 --> 01:20:40,800
Aaron, ain't you
forgetting about old Tub
throwing in with us?

1143
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:43,333
I was just waitin' to see
if he could hold out.

1144
01:20:43,433 --> 01:20:44,767
Don't worry about him.

1145
01:20:44,867 --> 01:20:49,100
He may not be
the man that Chig is,
but he'll hold up.

1146
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,833
I know he will.
I was just joshin'.

1147
01:20:51,933 --> 01:20:55,000
The main road's
over yonder.

1148
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,067
I'll go on up ahead.

1149
01:20:57,167 --> 01:21:00,867
The rest of you stay quiet.
And don't run your horses
until I give the signal.

1150
01:21:09,367 --> 01:21:17,300
(ANGEL SINGING IN SPANISH)

1151
01:21:38,167 --> 01:21:40,733
Senor McCool,
a man up there!

1152
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:43,867
A man up there!

1153
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:46,200
- Yeah? Where?
- Right up there!

1154
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,433
He is looking at us.
And he had a rifle.

1155
01:21:48,533 --> 01:21:50,267
The crazy goat
thief's lyin'.

1156
01:21:50,367 --> 01:21:52,967
I swear it, senor.
A man on a horse!

1157
01:21:53,067 --> 01:21:55,233
PLEASANT: He's trying
to spook you, McCool.

1158
01:22:03,267 --> 01:22:04,633
Ain't nobody
out there, McCool.

1159
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:08,467
They'll kill us!
They'll kill us all,
except him.

1160
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:20,567
They're all
right down there.

1161
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:23,600
This should be easy
as hot pie.

1162
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,933
I didn't see the one
on horseback, though.

1163
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:28,967
He's more than likely
resting up in the wagon.

1164
01:22:29,067 --> 01:22:31,567
I like hot pie
the easy way.

1165
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:33,300
That's why
we're all here.

1166
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,967
We got him six to two.

1167
01:22:36,067 --> 01:22:38,400
They gotta take
the chances, not us.

1168
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:42,333
Come on, fellas.
Just take care of yourselves
and keep plucking.

1169
01:22:42,433 --> 01:22:45,133
Let's go.

1170
01:22:58,533 --> 01:23:01,967
If the wagon is attacked,
you'll help Gid,
won't you?

1171
01:23:02,067 --> 01:23:03,400
Why?

1172
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,400
You can't let him
fight alone.

1173
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,433
Why can't I?

1174
01:23:10,067 --> 01:23:12,433
Call to him.
Tell him you'll help him.

1175
01:23:12,533 --> 01:23:14,800
Not a chance.

1176
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:17,100
Listen, kid,
and listen fast.

1177
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,767
He was right.
I was conning you.

1178
01:23:19,867 --> 01:23:21,733
I'd have done
anything to escape.

1179
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:23,433
You could've shot him
and you didn't.

1180
01:23:23,533 --> 01:23:25,167
You know why,
don't you?

1181
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:26,567
He does.

1182
01:23:26,667 --> 01:23:30,067
I'm in love with him.
Always have been.

1183
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,667
That's why he
turned his back
on the rifle.

1184
01:23:32,767 --> 01:23:35,233
He knew
I wouldn't shoot.

1185
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:37,333
(GUNFIRE)

1186
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:04,400
Mike, this might be
the last chance

1187
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,100
You'll ever have
to grow up.

1188
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,967
Are you gonna let us
just sit here
and get shot at?

1189
01:24:11,133 --> 01:24:13,300
Nobody is shooting
at you.

1190
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,667
I told ya.

1191
01:24:14,767 --> 01:24:17,900
I told ya
they'd come.

1192
01:24:18,067 --> 01:24:19,933
I hope you're satisfied.

1193
01:24:20,067 --> 01:24:21,633
You have a nice
front-row seat.

1194
01:24:21,733 --> 01:24:25,233
You can watch him
get killed!

1195
01:24:31,267 --> 01:24:32,167
McCool!

1196
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:33,733
(GUNSHOT)

1197
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:38,067
That marshal at San Carlos,
he don't have to win that bet.

1198
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:40,867
I was a chump, okay?
I admit it.

1199
01:24:40,967 --> 01:24:43,333
But you're being a chump, too,
if you don't let me help you.

1200
01:24:43,433 --> 01:24:45,233
We can take 'em.

1201
01:24:50,067 --> 01:24:51,800
Mike.

1202
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:56,567
It'll take more
than you and McCool
to stop 'em.

1203
01:25:22,533 --> 01:25:24,067
I got one of 'em.

1204
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:29,233
(WHISTLES)

1205
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,400
Well,
that makes two.

1206
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,900
They've flanked us.

1207
01:25:52,067 --> 01:25:54,067
Mike!

1208
01:26:04,133 --> 01:26:05,700
They busted
Tubby's leg.

1209
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,900
I saw Bunco go down.

1210
01:26:11,467 --> 01:26:14,833
- The kid heard you.
- I forgot Bunco's
his pa.

1211
01:26:14,933 --> 01:26:17,433
You and your big mouth.

1212
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,967
That's Chig over there
covering us.

1213
01:26:44,067 --> 01:26:47,433
Let's move in
on that wagon.

1214
01:26:52,167 --> 01:26:55,067
Old Chig's gonna
set this up for us.

1215
01:26:56,633 --> 01:26:57,967
(GUNSHOTS)

1216
01:26:58,067 --> 01:27:00,433
(RIFLE CLICKS)

1217
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,433
(GROANING)

1218
01:27:38,533 --> 01:27:39,733
That's crazy.

1219
01:27:39,833 --> 01:27:42,367
Chig's over there.

1220
01:27:42,467 --> 01:27:45,667
Sure came
from where he was.

1221
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,433
Hank! We're coming!

1222
01:28:01,533 --> 01:28:03,767
We'll get you,
Hank!

1223
01:28:03,867 --> 01:28:06,900
Aaron, get back here
behind the rock.

1224
01:28:09,533 --> 01:28:11,900
They ain't gonna
get to hang you, Hank.

1225
01:28:12,067 --> 01:28:13,867
Ain't nobody
gonna hang you.

1226
01:28:13,967 --> 01:28:15,667
Stay back, Aaron,
stay back!

1227
01:28:15,767 --> 01:28:18,067
Drop that gun.

1228
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:21,267
Aaron!

1229
01:28:27,067 --> 01:28:29,867
Uhh.

1230
01:28:31,367 --> 01:28:34,267
Hank.

1231
01:28:34,367 --> 01:28:38,833
That was my brother!
He come to get me!

1232
01:28:38,933 --> 01:28:43,100
He try, senor.
God knows he try.

1233
01:28:50,567 --> 01:28:53,633
What made you
change your mind?

1234
01:28:53,733 --> 01:28:56,433
She told me
she was in love with you.

1235
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,333
And she said
she always had been.

1236
01:29:09,433 --> 01:29:12,067
He knows it.
He's known it all along.

1237
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:16,267
You took a long time
in telling me.

1238
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:25,200
Gid, once this trip is over...

1239
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,733
It isn't likely
I'll be seeing you again.

1240
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:35,100
My regular run
is Huntsville.

1241
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,833
We'll visit.

1242
01:29:36,933 --> 01:29:38,800
We'll have a lot
of time to talk.

1243
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:45,300
Mike, let's get
on the road.

1244
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:57,233
