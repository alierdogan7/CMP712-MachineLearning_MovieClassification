to search my bag.

178
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:54,091
[Scoffs]

179
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:56,510
Our personal enmity aside,
Bohannon,

180
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:59,513
my offer of the reward
is sincere.

181
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:03,017
If the child is found,
I will make good on the gold.

182
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:07,071
Mr. Bohannon, come quick.
It's, um--it's about the baby.

183
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:09,490
This here's
railroad property, Durant.

184
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:12,860
You come back, I'll have you
arrested for trespassing.

185
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:15,763
Don't be surprised
if someday soon,

186
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:17,898
I return the favor.

187
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:30,878
He, uh...

188
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:33,347
he knows.

189
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:35,349
He as much as said so.

190
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:37,384
Sean, if he knew,

191
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:41,688
you would have a hole
in your head right there.

192
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:44,942
Find your manhood
and embrace it.

193
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:47,394
We're in the endgame.

194
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:48,962
[Knocks on carriage]

195
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:51,982
[Man whistles, shouts]

196
00:10:57,939 --> 00:10:59,873
Two of 'em--
they was right there,

197
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:01,909
tacked and ready to move out,
and then they was gone.

198
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:03,911
- Two horses all they took?
- And the tack.

199
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:05,579
Hell, the tack's worth
more than the horses.

200
00:11:05,613 --> 00:11:07,414
Herschel there said
they went straight south.

201
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:09,416
Couldn't say if they was
carrying a baby or not,

202
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,137
- but hell, he's half blind.
- Horse thieves.

203
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:14,505
Ain't no horse thieves
riskin' a hanging

204
00:11:14,556 --> 00:11:16,340
and leavin'
out in broad daylight.

205
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:18,976
He's right. It doesn't sound
like rustling to me.

206
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,478
What I'm saying is, what would
horse thieves want with a baby?

207
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,647
But baby thieves
need horses, sure.

208
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:27,985
- Where you going?
- Drop my reins.

209
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,770
You don't know
who these people are, Elam,

210
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:31,405
or if they even have the baby.

211
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:34,358
We ain't found her yet.
This got to be them.

212
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:38,579
Now, drop my reins like I say.

213
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:41,748
I can't wait for you.
Got to move this camp.

214
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:45,502
Then move it.

215
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:48,088
Come on, now.
Come on.

216
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,757
Come on, move!

217
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:32,334
Ezra Jacob Dutson, on this day
of your eighth birthday,

218
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,133
per the teachings
of the prophet Joseph Smith,

219
00:12:35,623 --> 00:12:39,093
you are baptized into the Church
of the Latter-Day Saints.

220
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:41,061
- [Chuckles]
- Kneel down, son.

221
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:43,197
Yes, father.

222
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:48,735
O, Lord...

223
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,106
pour out thy spirit
upon thy servant,

224
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,741
that he may do this work
with holiness of heart.

225
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:57,161
I have baptized thee,

226
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:59,830
having authority
from the almighty God,

227
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:03,250
as a testimony that ye have
entered into a covenant

228
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:06,420
to serve him until you are dead
as to mortal body,

229
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:09,790
and may he grant unto you
eternal life.

230
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:21,718
Happy Birthday, Ezra.

231
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:34,982
[Distant hoofbeats]

232
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:37,751
[Hoofbeats approaching]

233
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:52,666
Thought the camp couldn't move
without you.

234
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,220
Can't and won't.
Those the tracks?

235
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:59,873
Look like.
Can't tell which way they gone.

236
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:06,263
Denver.

237
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:08,182
Denver?
That's where that trail leads.

238
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:10,817
Other one leads
to an old surveyor camp.

239
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,819
- Ain't nothin' for 'em there.
- Denver 150 miles from here.

240
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:14,655
They get to Denver,
she gone for good.

241
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,023
She ain't got her mama's milk.

242
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:18,742
How's she gonna make it
to Denver?

243
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:21,361
She ain't.

244
00:14:31,873 --> 00:14:34,074
Ha!

245
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:57,898
It's Declan Toole.

246
00:14:57,932 --> 00:14:59,700
What do you want?

247
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:02,703
- May I come in?
- Go away.

248
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:09,743
I have nothing to say to you.

249
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:29,763
[Grunting]

250
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:40,607
Now, we gonna talk some.

251
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,910
You holler,

252
00:15:43,945 --> 00:15:46,280
I'm gonna gut you like a fish.

253
00:15:46,314 --> 00:15:49,116
You hear?

254
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,956
[Grunts]

255
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:04,548
[Coughs]

256
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:09,269
- I'm a New York City copper.
- Out here...

257
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,557
that don't make no nevermind.

258
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:16,443
Enough!

259
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,395
I've not taken the child.

260
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:20,147
I was looking for her,
same as you.

261
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:22,482
You was looking for her
in Elam tent?

262
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:24,067
That don't make no sense.

263
00:16:24,118 --> 00:16:27,154
Why would I take the baby?

264
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:34,328
On account of you don't want
no negroes raising her up,

265
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:37,798
that's why.

266
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:41,551
She's my own flesh and blood,
she is,

267
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:44,471
and I'd do nothing
to endanger that child.

268
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:52,312
You tell me,
where my baby niece at?

269
00:16:52,347 --> 00:16:54,848
Hmm?

270
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:02,656
Easy.

271
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:11,615
I don't see no horses.

272
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:15,235
Damn it, Elam.

273
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:43,814
[Rustling]

274
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:48,601
What?
What'd you find?

275
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,376
This is hers.

276
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:04,872
It's a fool's errand.
You know that, don't you?

277
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:06,724
You got the whole story
right there.

278
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:08,959
We don't know
if she dead or alive.

279
00:18:08,994 --> 00:18:11,245
- What you think?
- I don't know.

280
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:13,831
I ain't gonna stop till I do.

281
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:17,751
Might be best you never know.

282
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:29,430
You killed them men.

283
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:33,784
Wasn't to bring
your family back.

284
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:36,604
Why?

285
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:40,774
Made you feel better?

286
00:18:40,826 --> 00:18:43,227
It give you peace?

287
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:49,116
You go on back if you want.

288
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:53,170
I'm gonna go do what I got to do
for my little girl.

289
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:08,519
Ha!

290
00:19:08,553 --> 00:19:10,721
Come on!

291
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:13,390
Ha!

292
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:20,597
Shit.

293
00:19:37,883 --> 00:19:39,583
Eva.

294
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:55,232
Eva.

295
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:01,021
I've been looking for you.

296
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:09,363
She's better off...

297
00:20:09,414 --> 00:20:12,032
away from me.

298
00:20:15,537 --> 00:20:17,955
I couldn't give her nothing.

299
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:22,209
You could give her
a mother's love.

300
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,462
You don't know nothing
about it.

301
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,384
Eva.

302
00:20:30,435 --> 00:20:35,272
Eva, there--there was a time
I was intimate with Joseph.

303
00:20:37,142 --> 00:20:40,361
It destroyed my father, but...

304
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:43,513
I had fallen into darkness
and sin.

305
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:49,853
As time went on, I...

306
00:20:52,324 --> 00:20:55,409
discovered I...

307
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,128
was with child.

308
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:07,972
I was frightened.

309
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:16,347
Mm.

310
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:18,065
I...

311
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:19,850
thought through
all the possibilities

312
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:23,887
if I were to have the child,
and...

313
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,659
none of them were good.

314
00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:32,329
I prayed to the Lord
every night to...

315
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:36,900
take it away.

316
00:21:40,955 --> 00:21:43,507
Then...

317
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,126
nature took its course.

318
00:21:51,216 --> 00:21:55,719
I was not to be a mother,
and I felt...

319
00:21:55,753 --> 00:21:58,806
unworthy of God's love.

320
00:21:58,857 --> 00:22:01,141
I was a sinner...

321
00:22:03,978 --> 00:22:07,597
and I had sinned.

322
00:22:10,702 --> 00:22:14,321
But God did not spurn me...

323
00:22:14,372 --> 00:22:16,240
as others surely would have.

324
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:20,994
Even though I had been thinking
evil thoughts,

325
00:22:21,046 --> 00:22:22,996
he was not ashamed of me.

326
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:27,718
The good Lord gave me permission
to feel how I was feeling,

327
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:31,922
and however you're feeling
right now, Eva,

328
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:35,893
it's all right with him.

329
00:22:35,927 --> 00:22:38,929
The good Lord
has infinite capacity

330
00:22:38,963 --> 00:22:40,964
to take our sins.

331
00:22:47,689 --> 00:22:50,908
And all you have to do
is let him.

332
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:07,424
[Sighs]

333
00:23:10,712 --> 00:23:13,797
[Sobbing]

334
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:19,269
Shh. Shh.

335
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:22,306
[Continues sobbing]

336
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:27,561
Shh.

337
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:35,903
[Gags]

338
00:23:35,954 --> 00:23:39,689
[Breathing heavily]

339
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,163
Ugh.

340
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:52,386
There's kindness
in you yet, Psalms.

341
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,505
Not much.

342
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,840
[Chuckles]

343
00:24:00,145 --> 00:24:02,429
You were named
for a book in the Bible.

344
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,647
Mm-hmm.

345
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:07,017
My mama named me
after verse 37,

346
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:09,820
the one about God
slaying the wicked

347
00:24:09,854 --> 00:24:13,273
and offering comfort
to the suffering.

348
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:18,862
Have you considered
what you're doing?

349
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:22,916
I know what I'm doing.

350
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:26,620
Is it Christian?

351
00:24:26,671 --> 00:24:28,755
I'm gonna make you
give me back that baby.

352
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,290
That's Christian enough.

353
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:31,925
I can't give you
what I don't have.

354
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,877
[Chuckles]

355
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:35,629
You've given me
