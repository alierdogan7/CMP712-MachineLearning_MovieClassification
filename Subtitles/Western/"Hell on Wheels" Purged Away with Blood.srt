It's probably for the best.

372
00:27:19,716 --> 00:27:23,669
That child ain't got
a chance in this world.

373
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:27,306
But I guess you know that
better than anybody, don't you?

374
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:37,984
Have you heard about the train?

375
00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:40,236
Yes.

376
00:27:40,303 --> 00:27:43,022
Is he dead?

377
00:27:43,106 --> 00:27:45,358
No.

378
00:27:45,442 --> 00:27:47,360
No, he's not.

379
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,812
Then why are you here?

380
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,835
He wants to see you.

381
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,453
To see you and Joseph.

382
00:27:57,504 --> 00:28:01,090
Why?

383
00:28:02,342 --> 00:28:04,677
Don't know.

384
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:08,264
Maybe you can talk him into giving up.

385
00:28:08,331 --> 00:28:11,634
Why would he listen to me?

386
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:15,438
You're his daughter, Ruth.

387
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:17,440
How can you just sit there?

388
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:25,615
He hates me.

389
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:28,534
He has made that very clear

390
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:31,237
- my entire life.
- Ruth...

391
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:36,492
he's going to kill everyone on
that train if we don't do something.

392
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:40,379
I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.

393
00:28:40,464 --> 00:28:43,382
We have to try and stop him.

394
00:28:45,368 --> 00:28:47,753
I know you don't love me anymore.

395
00:28:47,838 --> 00:28:49,755
But please,

396
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,842
just do this one last thing for me.

397
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:05,238
He's dying, you know.

398
00:29:05,322 --> 00:29:07,857
Yeah, well... 

399
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:10,776
who the hell isn't?

400
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:13,863
Cullen: Hey, Reverend!

401
00:29:18,335 --> 00:29:20,953
Got some people here who
want to talk with you.

402
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,573
Sending them in, all right?

403
00:29:28,078 --> 00:29:30,129
Sure you want to do this?

404
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:32,431
Yes.

405
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:34,133
All right.

406
00:29:34,217 --> 00:29:36,919
Be careful in there.

407
00:29:44,394 --> 00:29:46,729
[Knock on door]

408
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,365
Come in.

409
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:10,886
Come to father, Ruth.

410
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:15,508
[Clears throat]

411
00:30:15,592 --> 00:30:18,761
Please, Ruth.

412
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:23,966
I want to be at peace
before I leave this world.

413
00:30:26,403 --> 00:30:28,938
Go.

414
00:30:45,422 --> 00:30:46,487
You... 

415
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:52,011
and your mother... [Clears throat]

416
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:56,349
didn't deserve the way I... 

417
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:59,352
I treated you.

418
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:04,106
But look... look what a... [Chuckles]

419
00:31:04,174 --> 00:31:07,643
strong person you turned out to be.

420
00:31:09,813 --> 00:31:13,399
You're... 

421
00:31:13,483 --> 00:31:17,903
you're a beautiful, strong woman.

422
00:31:17,988 --> 00:31:20,740
You're st... 

423
00:31:20,824 --> 00:31:22,958
stronger than I ever was

424
00:31:23,026 --> 00:31:25,544
or c... could be.

425
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:35,805
Please... 

426
00:31:35,872 --> 00:31:38,057
forgive me.

427
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:45,481
[Gasping]

428
00:31:48,151 --> 00:31:51,887
[Sobbing] I forgive you, father.

429
00:32:04,418 --> 00:32:06,001
You think it'll work?

430
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:09,271
One way or the other.

431
00:32:13,043 --> 00:32:15,177
Shit!

432
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,215
We got it under control.

433
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:21,583
Is the siege over?

434
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:23,436
We don't need you here.

435
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,139
Well, I've come to fetch my prisoner.

436
00:32:27,224 --> 00:32:30,109
Mr. Swedinforms me that he's on that train.

437
00:32:30,193 --> 00:32:32,394
Just doing my duty as a citizen.

438
00:32:32,446 --> 00:32:34,480
- Son of a bitch...
- Hey, hey.

439
00:32:34,564 --> 00:32:36,732
Easy now, fella.

440
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,954
This ain't over.

441
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:50,996
Jesus will forgive you,

442
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:53,799
but only if you let these people go.

443
00:32:53,884 --> 00:32:57,086
I'm willing to risk that for you, Joseph.

444
00:32:57,137 --> 00:33:00,923
What are you saying?

445
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:07,980
I'm gonna kill them all.

446
00:33:11,485 --> 00:33:14,153
Father, please.

447
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:18,741
I'm doing it all for you, son.

448
00:33:25,198 --> 00:33:27,333
I don't want this.

449
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:29,919
It's too late.

450
00:33:29,986 --> 00:33:31,337
Die is cast.

451
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:32,955
No.

452
00:33:33,006 --> 00:33:35,624
Yeah.

453
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:38,344
All that's left for us is to... 

454
00:33:38,428 --> 00:33:41,263
say good-bye.

455
00:33:47,354 --> 00:33:50,523
I love you, son.

456
00:33:52,526 --> 00:33:55,811
I love you, too.

457
00:33:55,862 --> 00:33:57,846
[Grunts]

458
00:33:59,682 --> 00:34:02,017
[Groans]

459
00:34:04,204 --> 00:34:06,822
[Groans]

460
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:09,875
[Gasps] Oh, my God!

461
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,046
[Groans]

462
00:34:23,506 --> 00:34:25,724
Behold... 

463
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:28,510
Your legacy.

464
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,185
Ohh... 

465
00:34:36,236 --> 00:34:41,407
[Sobbing]

466
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:21,397
Your knife.

467
00:35:45,972 --> 00:35:48,724
Take that man into ctody.

468
00:35:53,146 --> 00:35:54,963
Move out.

469
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:33,401
Don't go to Chicago.

470
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:35,820
I have to.

471
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:38,656
I made a promise.

472
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:41,510
When you come back,

473
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:45,580
we need to talk about that baby.

474
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:50,501
You mean your baby?

475
00:36:57,343 --> 00:36:59,677
The track is being repaired.

476
00:36:59,745 --> 00:37:03,214
We'll have you on your way soon.

477
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:08,052
Thank you.

478
00:37:11,445 --> 00:37:16,060
I've been thinking about... 

479
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:18,062
my son.

480
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:20,114
William.

481
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:25,570
I was a terrible father.

482
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:28,623
No, don't say that.

483
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:34,278
Terrible husband.

484
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:40,668
I need to see... 

485
00:37:40,753 --> 00:37:43,888
my wife.

486
00:37:43,955 --> 00:37:46,307
You will.

487
00:37:46,392 --> 00:37:51,145
I need her to forgive me.

488
00:37:53,766 --> 00:37:55,900
[Sighs]

489
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:58,686
For what?

490
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:00,438
Everything.

491
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:02,640
[Breathing hard]

492
00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:12,417
And... 

493
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:16,987
when I... when I return, I... 

494
00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:32,603
Good-bye, Thomas.

495
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:53,658
Being a country doctor's about
a lot more than you might think.

496
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,910
One of my many duties

497
00:38:55,994 --> 00:39:00,531
is to see people out of this world.

498
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:06,237
I'd hold their hand or talk to 'em.

499
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:10,374
Usually I'd just listen.

500
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:16,814
It was an obligation I took great pride in.

501
00:39:26,558 --> 00:39:31,195
Cullen... 

502
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:34,999
I would be truly honored

503
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:38,920
if it was you to see me out of this world.

504
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:44,241
Are you asking me to pull the trigger?

505
00:39:44,293 --> 00:39:46,210
Well, I sure don't want them Yankees

506
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:49,430
to be the last face I see.

507
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:57,605
Uh... 

508
00:39:59,424 --> 00:40:02,777
I can't... I can't do that.

509
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:10,234
I could still bust you out of
here. You just say the word.

510
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:12,453
I am not gonna let you pay the price

511
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,240
for me running like a
cwe can go to Mexico... 

512
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:17,792
Listen to me.

513
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,913
I am done running.

514
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:26,968
There's no honor in the
way I've been living.

515
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:34,759
The least I can do is die with some.

516
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:14,181
My 3 boys died in the war.

517
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:18,519
I never got a chance to bury them.

518
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:23,641
But... 

519
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:26,894
I had a good life.

520
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:30,147
Probably better than I deserve.

521
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:36,153
You want me to read some words?

522
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:57,773
I'm ready.

523
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:15,576
I don't know if I can do it.

524
00:42:18,137 --> 00:42:21,209
You be strong, son.

525
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:24,168
You be strong.
