1
00:01:44,223 --> 00:01:46,077
I am Bobby Jay Jones.

2
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,966
Close the door and take off your hat.

3
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:02,865
And listen, Bobby Jay Jones!

4
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:11,400
The convict being released from the Canyon City 
penitentiary today is looking for trouble.

5
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:15,171
- Give him some!
- I don't want any trouble in my town.

6
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:18,677
Me and my boys, there's 
all we can't handle.

7
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:22,854
- The first place he's probably heading 
for is Weed City. - We'll find him.

8
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:27,040
- Then he could come up here to Gun Hill.
- It will never happen.

9
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:32,743
- Here's $ 500, For that you watch him.
- Oh, we'll watch him.

10
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:39,380
- Yes, indeed! - Which ever way he heads
after leaving Weed City, you let me know.

11
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,460
For that, you'll get another
hundred dollars in gold.

12
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:48,167
And don't wink that eye of you again.
I'm not buying to kill him.

13
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:50,620
If you kill him, you'll get nothing.

14
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,543
Maybe even a something little worse.

15
00:02:56,056 --> 00:03:01,296
A man finishing stressing a place 
like that, must be pretty old.

16
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:03,806
I got my age.

17
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,651
This man got a name?

18
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:10,960
Clay Lomax.

19
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,377
- Clay Lomax!
- All right, main warden.

20
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:57,380
I'd wish you to have kept those.

21
00:03:57,797 --> 00:04:01,100
I was counting on you getting
a fixing coming right back here.

22
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:06,119
I ain't getting in any trouble until
I find the trouble that I want.

23
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:11,653
I say this for you, warden...

24
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:16,308
- You've been one mean son-of-a-bitch.
- Likewise.

25
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,441
I know you hate me, but not as much 
as you hate somebody out there.

26
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,161
I'll see you soon.

27
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:31,679
Good afternoon!

28
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:35,612
The no. 12 to Kansas City,
when is it coming through?

29
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:48,500
No. 12 from Kansas City?
Tomorrow morning at 9 'o clock.

30
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:50,558
Oh, give or take an hour.

31
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:53,470
- Is Trooper still in business?
- Trooper?

32
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:56,400
No don't get up in my time.

33
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:59,652
Yes, he's still in business.

34
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:03,385
Right down the street.
Right next door to...

35
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:07,776
Next door to what? 
I didn't quite hear you.

36
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:12,506
- To the bank.
- Next door to the bank.

37
00:06:13,903 --> 00:06:16,046
Stockman's Bank. Yeah.

38
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:08,829
Times for eyes seeing ghosts!
What the hell are you doing here?

39
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:13,067
I just wanted to see if there's any 
of my blood still on the sidewalk.

40
00:07:13,187 --> 00:07:15,217
They wore all.

41
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:53,403
They let you or you busted out?

42
00:07:53,697 --> 00:07:55,954
Nobody busts out of Canyon City.

43
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:59,916
- It don't seem like seven years!
- Just to me I've done them.

44
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:05,187
- You would have gotten out heap sooner if 
you'd name the other man. - So they said.

45
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:10,416
- He shot you in the back. He must 
have been a stranger. - No.

46
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,268
- You knew him.
- I did?. - You did.

47
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:18,148
- My partner.
- Sam Foley!

48
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:20,753
Well, I'll be...

49
00:08:21,364 --> 00:08:25,509
- Well, that's what they call water 
under the bridge. - Where is he?

50
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:29,445
Who? Oh, Sam!

51
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:34,192
- He's long gone.
- Gone where? - He's gone.

52
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:38,070
Save yourself from charging 
that drink, Clay.

53
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:41,381
Nice to see you're back.

54
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:45,083
See, I've been on something else 
you ain't having seven years.

55
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:49,292
All of them new. 
Fresh of from the farm.

56
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:51,488
A real live bunch of 
rubber dolls.

57
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:56,278
- Ain't not one of them over twenty.
- Sam Foley... How much?

58
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:00,245
How much?

59
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,568
- $ 200.
- That ain't enough.

60
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:06,086
That's all I have got.
Now where is he?

61
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:11,372
- Where's your two hundred dollars?
- There's a woman holding my money in Kansas City.

62
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:14,237
Kansas City, hell!

63
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:19,335
- Ain't no woman kept nothing for 7 years.
- On the way, it'll be here tomorrow.

64
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:23,436
- Why did you have her send here?
- It all started here.

65
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:26,210
It's the last place I saw him.

66
00:09:27,328 --> 00:09:32,236
It ain't much money.
You don't know how bad he's gone.

67
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:34,270
Respectable bad!

68
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,897
I probably would get twice as much money 
from him for not tell you where he is.

69
00:09:41,392 --> 00:09:45,760
Let's say I told you where you 
could find Sam for $ 200...

70
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:50,949
- What would you do?
- Pay you, and kill him.

71
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,889
Muchachas!

72
00:09:57,188 --> 00:10:02,295
- Hey Grand's! Folk's bourbon, a new bottle!
- I don't know if you're is old enough?

73
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:06,833
Oh now, we're old enough. 
And you're old too, grands.

74
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:10,605
You want glasses or I just 
put a nipple on the bottle?

75
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:15,576
- You watch your mouth. This here 
is Bobby Jay. - Bobby Jay!?

76
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:19,627
That is just a divine name!
I just couldn't say no to a drink!

77
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,694
- They call me Alma.
- How old are you? - Twenty.

78
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:27,639
Well, you still got a couple 
of good years left.

79
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:32,276
I bet he's a hundred.

80
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:37,505
- That's old enough for five people.
- If he was a turtle he would be young.

81
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,270
I've heard about a turtle
to be 400.

82
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,923
What would people took 
to living that long?

83
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:47,814
Alma, where did you get that shine up?
Did you do rubs up the wall?

84
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:50,433
Stepped on the toes!
That's a good one.

85
00:10:50,553 --> 00:10:54,454
People ought to be like those, when 
they get too old you just shoot them. 

86
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:59,178
And it's gonna come to that. If they 
don't there ain't gonna be enough room.

87
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:03,123
- Who will say who's who?
- Well me, honey.

88
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:05,803
Sooner or later it would 
become your turn.

89
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:11,654
Because if you live, you get older.
And if you live enough, you get old.

90
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:15,532
Pepe! You all hear something?

91
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:19,535
Did you hear, Alma?

92
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:24,816
Bobby Jay, come on, Bobby Jay.
Let's gonna snuggle.

93
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,835
You all want to snuggle?

94
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:32,229
- Now they want to snuggle too.
- Yeah well, sure!

95
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:35,235
We got Looloo, Penzy, and Berta...

96
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:41,027
- No, we've got you.
- No, I am sorry.

97
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:44,330
- oh Alma, these are my boys.
- No. Just you and me.

98
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,962
You and me, and Skeeter! What?

99
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:49,687
All right.

100
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:54,649
- Three Musketeers! Pepe!
- Last again! But grateful!

101
00:11:55,051 --> 00:11:59,431
- You got to pay 6 pence for that bottle!
- We just keep going, friend!

102
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:11,957
If you asks me, the old one
should kill the kids.

103
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,766
We were talking about Sam Foley.

104
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:17,478
Get your money and 
we'll talk some more.

105
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,023
Emma!

106
00:12:25,313 --> 00:12:28,859
- Emma wouldn't still be around with you?
- Emma, come here!

107
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:33,719
Oh, Clay!

108
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:40,165
- You still give them good 
neck poppers? - Turn around.

109
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:43,820
You're mad about something?

110
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:48,998
He's hot all over.

111
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:51,208
I don't want to hear about it.

112
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:58,197
- We'll talk. But hell, I've always 
liked that fellow. - So did I.

113
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:01,191
Until I stopped.

114
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,100
That's where they dug the bullet out?

115
00:13:12,145 --> 00:13:14,599
Yeah, they dug it out of there.

116
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:16,504
But they didn't dig it 
out of your mind.

117
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:20,734
Bobby Jay! Come on,
Bobby Jay! Let me in!

118
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:23,458
Will you shut up, for Christ sake!

119
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,534
- Let me in!
- Shut up!

120
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:36,077
Bobby Jay! Come on, Bobby Jay! 
Will you let come in too?

121
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:42,046
- Bobby Jay, come on! - Shut up! 
- Bobby Jay, I want to come in!

122
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:03,220
- You're disturbing the peace.
- Peace of what?

123
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:07,732
Let's cut out the jokes. 
And keep the mouth shut.

124
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:11,290
You got your stubborn boots on, 
Bobby Jay. Stop him.

125
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:59,412
- That sure is a broke of knife. - I'd like 
to break the rest of it all on his liver.

126
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:04,854
- Watch you said, but don't touch you said.
- No one has slapped me, not even my father.

127
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:09,396
Don't forget what Mr. Foley 
said about that killing!

128
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:23,367
- He tried to kill you.
- He will try it again.

129
00:15:34,404 --> 00:15:37,997
- Not much of a horse.
- Could enough for a gift but not much cash.

130
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:41,801
Well, I guess he could carry
you and all that money.

131
00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:44,752
I hope your memory is
as big as your mouth.

132
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:46,895
I want a lot of answers
for all that money.

133
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:49,572
You'll get them.

134
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:51,335
You're Clay Lomax?
Do you know a Teresa Ortega?

135
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:53,715
I have got something for you.

136
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:09,913
My name is Decky. My mommy told 
me to call you Theo Clay.

137
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:13,059
That means Uncle Clay.

138
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:19,412
- What the hell is this?
- Just as it looks like, a small female child.

139
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,641
I was told to deliver her to you.

140
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:29,454
My mom says you always wore a 
Texas hat. That's a Colorado hat.

141
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:35,516
I was expecting an envelope. Is there 
any rules that I got to take it?

142
00:17:36,044 --> 00:17:37,559
No... no company rule.

143
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:43,597
We got to take out water. 
Make up your mind, mister.

144
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:54,587
Her mother started out with her, but 
she died just outside Kansas City.

145
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:00,099
- Died? From what?
- Men, the doc said.

146
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:02,909
She'd not even been thirty.

147
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:07,253
She looked more like fifty. Anyway,
we took her off and buried her.

148
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:14,970
- What happens if I just leave her on 
the train? - To you? Nothing. - To her?

149
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:20,542
The first town we hit that's got 
a Marshall I'd hand her over.

150
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,351
Wait a minute. We found this
piece of paper pinned on the kid.

151
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:32,372
It's got your name on it.

152
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:26,962
Well now, maybe you're better off.

153
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:31,908
After what do you expect from 
a man who changes his hats?

154
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:57,534
- Decky. What's your last name? - Ortega.
- No, that was your mother's. Your father's?

155
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,892
- I ain't got no father.
- Everybody has got a father.

156
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:10,551
- You're about five years old maybe?
- Six, going on seven.

157
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:14,654
- Six, going on seven...
- Well, how does it come out?

158
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:20,293
Do you leave her here or some place else?
She didn't have a name printed out of nothing.

159
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:25,236
- Someone has a mean sense of humor.
- Mean to you, or her?

160
00:20:26,613 --> 00:20:29,548
There ain't no law that says
you got to accept shipment.

161
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,653
I can't hold up this train waiting for 
you to figure what a way to weasel out.

162
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:38,314
- Watch your mouth. - Forget it, mister. 
I just carry her over to a Marshall.

163
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,722
Someway down the lines.
Maybe it will be better off.

164
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:45,350
A man who changes hats.

165
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:49,216
Oh, hell!

166
00:20:50,472 --> 00:20:52,997
- Come on, kid.
- I won't!

167
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:59,202
- Come on! - I don't want to go with him!
- You have decided? - Yeah.

168
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:05,008
If you don't get this,
you didn't take that.

169
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:08,157
Please don't leave me here!
Please!

170
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:11,921
Please don't leave me here!
Please!

171
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,035
Don't leave me!

172
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:18,361
I don't want to go with you!

173
00:21:22,652 --> 00:21:24,836
- Now limber.
- I won't.

174
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:26,909
If you don't then I'll drop you
on your little rump.

175
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:30,044
Put me down. You hate me!

176
00:21:41,163 --> 00:21:43,526
I don't want to go!

177
00:22:02,682 --> 00:22:04,799
This ain't never gonna go away.

178
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,602
I will remain a huge black eye.

179
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:11,056
- How much sugar?
- Bastards!

180
00:22:11,176 --> 00:22:15,042
I says to him, do anything you want
but please don't touch my poor eyes.

181
00:22:15,162 --> 00:22:18,083
Well, that was it! 
Red blank as a bull.

182
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:22,597
_ Did he smack you?
- No! Right in the eyes. I'm so dumb.

183
00:22:22,823 --> 00:22:27,860
I should have known! He just got 
to do what a girl says he can't.

184
00:22:28,107 --> 00:22:29,927
I got you just the thing for you.

185
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:48,961
I sell these little bastards, to 
the bar-fighters for a dollar each.

186
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:53,716
- I just thought it in connection with 
a female. - What the hell is them?

187
00:22:53,836 --> 00:22:58,911
- Real live Mexican bloodsucker worms!
- Well, them is leeches.

188
00:22:59,031 --> 00:23:02,357
- It draws the color right out of the skin.
- I will not.

189
00:23:02,477 --> 00:23:06,842
Shoot honey, I wouldn't do 
you no mean trick. Watch!

190
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,185
Put one of those on your cheek and you'll
get a complexion like a new-born babies.

191
00:23:22,004 --> 00:23:25,726
You know something?
I forgot to collect my money.

192
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:28,617
- From them three fellas?
- Yeah.

193
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:34,338
- I didn't know how much I'd charge.
- Just powder your eye and drink your coffee.

194
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:37,866
Collecting money, 
that's what men are for.

195
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:51,037
Now, Who would do a thing like 
this to a man's property?

196
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:56,124
Some low-cow-shagged tail with a knife 
and he must have had it done like this.

197
00:23:57,105 --> 00:24:01,438
- All this damages on you're gonna be billed!
- Mister, don't rouse him before breakfast.

198
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,393
I'm gonna take an inventory of all 
you damaged, burned or busted!

199
00:24:08,034 --> 00:24:13,130
- Pour us some coffee. 
- Pour your own. - Pour!

200
00:24:13,623 --> 00:24:15,114
What is them things?

201
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:22,689
- Well, that's her breakfast.
- No. You gotta be kidding me!

202
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:28,372
Alma will eat anything you give her. 
Eat them thing, Alma!

203
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:35,604
- Bobby Jay! - What?
- Only he'd done was meet a train.

204
00:24:35,983 --> 00:24:39,493
- Well, did he get on that train?
- No.

205
00:24:39,902 --> 00:24:43,318
Very interesting. Come on!
What else did he do?

206
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:49,586
He stole a little girl, about so high.
It looks like he's bringing her here.

207
00:24:51,212 --> 00:24:56,084
It sounds like an old Bank robber is gone 
white slave trader. Now you hear that, Alma?

208
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:59,742
Lomax is bringing your replacement!

209
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:03,916
- Is she gonna eat this thing?
- Well, sure she's gonna eat that thing.

210
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:08,806
- Do you want to see? - Trooper!
- You give me my money! - What money?

211
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:12,388
- From last night.
- Oh the hell, you owe us.

212
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,686
Pepe, what'd you think
we ought to charge?

213
00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:19,229
I don't know.
She had a nice roll in her purse!

214
00:25:26,175 --> 00:25:27,948
Give her back her purse!

215
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:31,612
Give her back her purse 
stay down!

216
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:36,547
- You tore that wall and you're gonna pay!
- We ain't paying for nothing, grands.

217
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,261
We are getting paid.

218
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:43,623
- Pepe, see what's in that cash drawer.
- Watch your line. I've got a gun at you!

219
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:49,096
Well now, I declare?
You've drawn your gun on me.

220
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:56,649
- Why did you do that?
- Self-defense. - He's dead!

221
00:25:57,069 --> 00:26:00,557
- Not.
- Oh, yes he is.

222
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:05,364
Well, that's right Skeeter, 
we are three musketeers.

223
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:11,167
- Next!
- Bobby Jay Jones, I swear...

224
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:15,946
What is that, is our blood brother
going back on his solemn word?

225
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,216
Get the money out of the drawer! 
Do you know how to cook?

226
00:26:28,477 --> 00:26:32,868
Wrong! You know to cook!
You'd just hide on. Come on.

227
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:38,316
- Trooper! - Tell clay...
- Clay is gone.

228
00:26:38,885 --> 00:26:41,714
Gun... Hill.

229
00:26:50,814 --> 00:26:55,393
My mom says no cowboy ever
walks when he can ride.

230
00:27:12,701 --> 00:27:17,139
- Sit right there, or I'll whirl you.
- No, you won't.

231
00:27:19,341 --> 00:27:20,621
It's Trooper!

232
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:24,472
- Them three kids shot him.
- Did they? - Yeah.

233
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:29,098
And then they left, took Alma with them.
Did anybody going after them? - Nobody yet.

234
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:34,832
Before he died he said your name 
and something about Gun Hill.

235
00:27:35,242 --> 00:27:37,837
- Gun Hill?
- Yeah.

236
00:27:57,445 --> 00:28:03,093
- I'd pay a weight. - I'm sorry.
- I never had kids, never wanted none.

237
00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:16,865
I'd ran away from you anyway.

238
00:28:20,428 --> 00:28:25,031
It seems to me you are the right one.
She got to go to school anyhow.

239
00:28:25,254 --> 00:28:29,199
I can't board any children, 
all I can do to teach them.

240
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:33,870
- What do you teach them? 
Look out for yourself? - Yes.

241
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:44,291
No!

242
00:28:44,492 --> 00:28:49,983
But preacher you are my last hope 
left in this town I can turn to.

243
00:28:50,256 --> 00:28:55,857
- I suggest to turn this responsibility 
over to the Marshall. - To the law?

244
00:28:56,494 --> 00:28:58,329
Turn her over to the law?

245
00:28:58,449 --> 00:29:02,591
Preacher, you know I've done bad things 
in my day but nothing that bad.

246
00:29:03,216 --> 00:29:07,602
Reverend, you're harder than hard.
I'd say you are mean.

247
00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:09,168
Perhaps.

248
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:13,472
But not mean enough to try to 
get rid of a child in her presence.

249
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,217
- You've got any soap? 
- No. - Well, I have.

250
00:30:28,449 --> 00:30:31,690
- You stink. You got to have a bath.
- No!

251
00:30:41,352 --> 00:30:47,011
- Now shove them rags. - No! - Get them 
off or I'll do it for you. - I won't!

252
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:20,823
- You bastard stinkpot, it's cold!
- What did you say?

253
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:23,037
You bastard stinkpot!

254
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:27,289
You say that again and  I'll 
scrub your dirty little mouth!

255
00:31:42,062 --> 00:31:47,299
- What about you? You stink too!
- If I've finished with you I'll take mine.

256
00:31:56,661 --> 00:32:01,323
- Are you my father?
- What kind of fool's question is that?

257
00:32:02,842 --> 00:32:04,622
But since you're so curious...

258
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:08,480
Me and your mama was friends 
of us, a hundred years ago.

259
00:32:09,384 --> 00:32:11,509
- You're not an uncle.
- No.

260
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:16,772
I sure had a lot of uncles.
But they were no good.

261
00:32:17,257 --> 00:32:20,263
Mama said no man was any good.

262
00:32:22,086 --> 00:32:25,735
- On the third time she came to visit.
- Visit? Where?

263
00:32:26,034 --> 00:32:28,911
She lived with other ladies.

264
00:32:29,217 --> 00:32:30,649
I stayed with folks.

265
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:33,538
- What folks?
- Different ones.

266
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:38,824
The last ones didn't want me to keep 
my cat. They threw stones at her.

267
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:43,368
- As long as they didn't hit her...
- They did! They killed her.

268
00:32:44,477 --> 00:32:48,199
The place I'm taking you to are friends
of mine, they'll let you have a cat.

269
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:54,226
- I don't want any more cats.
- The Nelsons got a nice place, a real farm.

270
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:01,578
It's still a far piece. 
We better get going.

271
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:20,303
That ain't the way to Gun Hill!
Why are we getting here, Jay?

272
00:33:20,423 --> 00:33:23,497
You got to tell Sammy we cut out 
for Mexico, to get our money, huh?

273
00:33:23,617 --> 00:33:27,025
- Oh now, you're thinking for me?
- No, no!

274
00:33:45,642 --> 00:33:48,677
I'm sure have a fine running cards.

275
00:33:48,878 --> 00:33:52,272
It looks like the Nelsons 
had the same.

276
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:07,777
Indians!

277
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:16,766
What are you figuring, scout?

278
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:20,625
- Navajo or Apache?
- I don't know.

279
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:27,897
- Is it Indians?
- Worse.

280
00:34:28,226 --> 00:34:30,175
Worse than Indians, Decky.

281
00:34:30,744 --> 00:34:35,476
- That there is the smell of hard times.
- Are you funning me? - No.

282
00:34:35,714 --> 00:34:38,074
There ain't nothing else smells that bad.

283
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:43,219
Let's fix us a campfire, so we 
can make that stink go away.

284
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,992
Hey, you told me you could cook!

285
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:13,957
If you're pulling a gun,
I would tell you I could fly!

286
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:18,925
- And you walking on water and turning
sticks into snakes! - You told me a lie.

287
00:35:19,045 --> 00:35:22,591
- Yes. - Yes? Why?
- I told a lie.

288
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:25,474
Don't you think you ought
be punished for that?

289
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,628
Punished? One eye is swollen shut,
the other is smoke blind.

290
00:35:30,948 --> 00:35:34,024
I'm too stiff to stand up
and I'm too sour to sit down.

291
00:35:34,144 --> 00:35:38,973
Plus I'm sun burned. How are you 
gonna punish me? - Oh, there's ways.

292
00:35:39,234 --> 00:35:43,825
Bobby Jay. Come let me rustle up
something to eat. That girl is a mess.

293
00:35:44,086 --> 00:35:48,230
Well, that's true. 
But I want her to cook.

294
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:52,047
And when I want someone to
do something, the do it.

295
00:35:57,693 --> 00:36:02,049
- Now, you see anything? - It seems 
Lomax is settling down for the night.

296
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:05,081
He got a nice fire going too.

297
00:36:15,411 --> 00:36:18,746
How high you reckon 
a man can flap a jack?

298
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:30,404
- Where did it go?
- A schooner bird, he stole it in mid-air.

299
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:37,043
- That was my pancakes! - Schooner bird is 
the only one thing that can eat and fly.

300
00:36:38,235 --> 00:36:42,650
- Maybe because they fly backwards. - Backwards?
- To keep the dust out of their eyes.

301
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:46,771
They live on flapjacks, chewing 
tobacco and hard-rock candy!

302
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:52,731
- Damn you bird, bring it back!
- Cursing won't fetch nothing of them.

303
00:36:53,118 --> 00:36:58,919
Here, you give me your plate. There's an 
Apache magic trick that will get it again.

304
00:36:59,944 --> 00:37:03,934
Now you keep it covered 
and held tightly.

305
00:37:04,177 --> 00:37:06,221
I will say the magical words.

306
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:09,493
- You got the hold tight? - Tight!
- Repeat after me.

307
00:37:09,763 --> 00:37:13,368
- Hoki-Poki!
- Hoki-Poki!

308
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,857
- Dame Noki!
- Dame Noki!

309
00:37:28,071 --> 00:37:32,122
- It didn't work.
- Of course it always works.

310
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,370
Did you look?

311
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:53,883
You swallow it down and get some sleep.
We've got places to go coming morning.

312
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,470
Can you ride a horse?

313
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,855
- I'm doing that now?
- No, I mean by yourself.

314
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,251
Of course. They'd always let me ride...

315
00:39:03,498 --> 00:39:06,586
- ...when I get to the livery stable.
- The livery stable?

316
00:39:07,716 --> 00:39:12,166
- What kind of job did you hold out?
- I cleaned up the stables.

317
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,148
What did they pay you for that?

318
00:39:16,302 --> 00:39:20,223
I told you!
They let me ride the horses.

319
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:26,241
Well, if I'm gonna drag you all the way
to Gun Hill, what you need is a pony.

320
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:28,942
We'll cut out that little one.

321
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:37,165
- That's stealing! - They're wild 
horses, they don't belong to nobody.

322
00:39:37,629 --> 00:39:42,655
At the next ranch we come to, I'm gonna 
swap that little coat for a saddle.

323
00:39:42,856 --> 00:39:44,745
Come on now. Get down.

324
00:40:02,688 --> 00:40:05,259
Get him! Get him!

325
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:09,454
Get him!

326
00:40:19,522 --> 00:40:21,225
Get him!

327
00:40:39,658 --> 00:40:43,627
Hooray! Hooray! You got him!

328
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:05,350
- He's a nice little gentleman, ain't he?
- May I pet him now?

329
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:09,324
- You just don't let him pick a hug 
out of you! - I know to do with horses.

330
00:41:17,902 --> 00:41:21,601
It is stealing!
I won't let you!

331
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:26,183
- You're trying to put me in 
my place? - It is stealing!

332
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:33,243
Oh, you're tougher than wrang leather.

333
00:41:37,477 --> 00:41:41,175
All right. Damn it!

334
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:45,320
Go on back.

335
00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:50,278
What's wrang leather?

336
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:55,283
It's something that 
don't come apart in the rain.

337
00:42:57,604 --> 00:43:03,521
- No doubt about! He's headed toward Gun Hill!
- Yeah. That's all I need to know.

338
00:43:03,641 --> 00:43:07,397
So? We cut across these hills 
and tell Mr. Foley, right?

339
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:11,617
Wrong! The man wants trouble.

340
00:43:35,803 --> 00:43:38,257
I don't care if you are mad at me!

341
00:43:38,377 --> 00:43:41,651
If you'd done as to the pony, you 
wouldn't have fallen out of your mother.

342
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:45,779
I wasn't took away from her, 
she was taken away from me.

343
00:43:46,605 --> 00:43:48,898
Wranged leather.

344
00:43:49,914 --> 00:43:51,428
Again?

345
00:43:57,711 --> 00:44:00,073
Don't get snake bit!

346
00:44:13,523 --> 00:44:17,789
Why don't you get upon him and shoot 
that old man and little girl, huh?

347
00:44:18,758 --> 00:44:21,900
We can wait up here for you 
until you get back.

348
00:44:23,116 --> 00:44:27,656
I don't want to catch up to him yet.
I want to have some fun with him!

349
00:44:28,786 --> 00:44:33,786
Shoot him? Shoot him?
That's no fun, Alma.

350
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:39,840
You don't have any imagination. It's either
in bed, or on out. - You know he's right.

351
00:44:40,161 --> 00:44:46,116
No, I don't. You know that I spent 
the whole night in lobby listening.

352
00:44:46,336 --> 00:44:50,166
We're making it up to you now.
I bet you ride with her.

353
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,414
Don't you feel good?

354
00:44:54,278 --> 00:44:56,939
- Damn! Look at that thing!
- What?

355
00:44:59,622 --> 00:45:02,610
She got split my bridges
with that big behind.

356
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:08,343
I can't help it. You want me to ride this 
horse all naked! - That's bad, Alma!

357
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:12,265
- You know what's happens to bad girls?
- Don't do that.

358
00:45:12,563 --> 00:45:15,936
- What's the matter Pepe? Don't you 
like to have fun? - Sure I do, but...

359
00:45:16,056 --> 00:45:18,941
Well alright then, we're gonna
have some fun! Yes, we are!

360
00:45:35,472 --> 00:45:37,896
You know I think you're horse-crazy.

361
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,169
They're nicer than people.

362
00:45:42,294 --> 00:45:43,797
How would you like to have him?

363
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:17,649
- I'm stealing it.
- I know!

364
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:22,610
- Why ain't you kicking about it?
- The foal had a mom, this one doesn't.

365
00:46:23,138 --> 00:46:24,923
They have got an owner.

366
00:46:27,896 --> 00:46:32,558
We could tell that it was wild pony,
in the pasture and couldn't jump out.

367
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,076
You're growing up fast.

368
00:46:45,816 --> 00:46:49,209
- Do you know what they do with 
horse-thieves? - They hang them.

369
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:09,648
Good day!

370
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:14,391
- Good afternoon!
- I make it morning.

371
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:21,532
- I think I've seen that pony before.
- I got him out your coral back there.

372
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:23,318
Do you want to get rid of him?

373
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:25,775
I could be I left the gate open.

374
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,036
That little scrub like him 
I figure it might be worth...

375
00:47:31,128 --> 00:47:32,312
...a couple of dollars.

376
00:47:32,513 --> 00:47:36,195
He has got a sentimental value.
It belonged to my late wife.

377
00:47:36,407 --> 00:47:41,362
- Why don't you put a sentimental price 
on him? - Oh, uh... 20 dollars?

378
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:47,107
- Do you've got a saddle with him?
- My late wife. She ran off.

379
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:51,945
With a knife with her.
Saddle that... that'll run you another 10.

380
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:57,089
- It'll be a nice outfit for the little lady.
- He's just trying to smooth me down.

381
00:47:57,444 --> 00:48:00,675
Well, is that so, little lady? 
And what for?

382
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:03,783
He's been trying to dug me off,
every place we go.

383
00:48:04,302 --> 00:48:07,531
I could stay here, then you 
will have to buy me a pony.

384
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:12,353
- Let's get on with the deal.
- Hmm...

385
00:48:12,952 --> 00:48:17,543
- $ 15 for the pony and $ 5 for the saddle.
- $ 15 for the both.

386
00:48:18,883 --> 00:48:20,585
Count out your money!

387
00:48:28,401 --> 00:48:34,108
- Your name is El Sueno, that means dream.
- Her name happens to be Patty.

388
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:36,785
El Sueno!

389
00:49:18,035 --> 00:49:22,756
- I won't eat that. - Why not? Rabbit is good 
- It makes me think of my cat.

390
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:28,853
- I won't eat it. - What the hell will you eat?
- Flapjacks. - You can't eat them every day.

391
00:49:33,316 --> 00:49:37,720
- Let me take a look at them legs of yours.
- They're all right. You go eat that cat.

392
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,361
Don't you speak out.
That's saddled up and raw.

393
00:49:42,922 --> 00:49:45,247
That's my good Indian jacket.

394
00:49:45,576 --> 00:49:49,169
It's about to become a good Indian vest.

395
00:49:49,409 --> 00:49:55,116
- These'll make good leggings for you.
- You spoil my jacket. I won't wear no legging!

396
00:49:55,612 --> 00:50:00,837
- You will. One more day like today and 
your feet will break off. - No, I won't!

397
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:33,265
They've been down for the night.
It looks like.

398
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:36,400
Pepe, take over.

399
00:50:39,553 --> 00:50:41,150
Move!

400
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:57,929
- Yes, sir! - Yeah General, you 
got yourself one hell of a an army.

401
00:50:58,223 --> 00:50:59,761
Give me a drag.

402
00:51:01,607 --> 00:51:05,376
- I gave you an order.
- Yes, sir!

403
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:17,250
It's you own fault for not doing what 
you're told. Get out there and watch!

404
00:54:12,856 --> 00:54:15,286
Give me all the guns! Right Here!

405
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:36,148
Put your hands on your heads! 
Turn around!

406
00:54:38,582 --> 00:54:42,598
Is he still carrying that knife 
in his boot? Get it.

407
00:54:48,044 --> 00:54:50,228
Your friends...

408
00:54:50,435 --> 00:54:54,445
...they took turns gunning old
Trooper in his wheelchair.

409
00:54:54,843 --> 00:54:59,023
Shot hit him in the belly, 
so he died real slow.

410
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,324
You know what happens when you got
shot in the belly? You can't move.

411
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:11,034
You can't breathe. You feel yourself 
filling up with blood, with pain.

412
00:55:11,327 --> 00:55:13,371
And you can't die!

413
00:55:13,491 --> 00:55:16,415
Lomax, you know I got 
a man covered you!

414
00:55:16,724 --> 00:55:19,101
You had a man. This is his gun!

415
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:24,488
- Don't shoot me in the back, please!
- You've been trailing me. Why?

416
00:55:25,714 --> 00:55:27,085
Who sent you?

417
00:55:27,186 --> 00:55:30,325
We got orders to do you no harm 
and we've done you none!

418
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:35,183
- Who? - Don't nobody do no talking! 
- You tell him! Don't let him shoot me!

419
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:41,706
Sam Foley. What Skeeter told you is true! 
They got orders not to kill you!

420
00:55:41,926 --> 00:55:47,486
- Just to follow you and let know when you come 
to Gun Hill. - Does Foley know? - He sure does!

421
00:55:47,606 --> 00:55:52,293
And I'd think hard on that... 
You bitch!

422
00:56:04,629 --> 00:56:06,273
Any more?

423
00:56:07,568 --> 00:56:12,749
- I'm leaving you your horses, punk.
- Maybe I see you again.

424
00:56:13,014 --> 00:56:18,899
Just do your little choir, punk.
You tell him I'm coming.

425
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:27,875
Just tell him.

426
00:56:49,176 --> 00:56:54,254
I know you what you are. 
A holdup man. That's what.

427
00:56:54,591 --> 00:57:00,066
All that damn shooting last night. I 
thought you tried to murder another rabbit.

428
00:57:00,687 --> 00:57:05,296
- Rabbits don't carry guns.
- Oh shut up and ride.

429
00:57:21,114 --> 00:57:27,031
Let's stick to the road, we get to Gun Hill 
a lot faster that way. - Oh, shut up!

430
00:57:27,395 --> 00:57:31,344
Maybe he's right. The way Lomax is going, 
he won't get there before tomorrow morning.

431
00:57:31,464 --> 00:57:35,475
- And we got to let Foley know.
- Not without my gun!

432
00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:50,235
- It's gonna start raining again.
- Yep.

433
00:57:54,814 --> 00:57:56,766
It's getting dark too.

434
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:04,354
You used to talk a lot, and now you're 
getting crumpy like a... father.

435
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:09,466
Did your mother ever tell 
you who your father was?

436
00:58:09,745 --> 00:58:12,592
She only told me he was 
a good-looking bastard.

437
00:59:01,432 --> 00:59:04,866
Hey, mister. 
Come on in out of the wet!

438
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:17,203
- I'll take care of your horses.
- I'll give you a hand. - I don't need it.

439
00:59:17,323 --> 00:59:19,313
You go on in.

440
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,378
You know how to blow dry my pony?

441
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:24,320
Brush her with a straw.

442
00:59:24,485 --> 00:59:26,657
Yes, ma'am.

443
00:59:45,575 --> 00:59:49,890
- Come in. Bring the child out of the rain.
- The rain will dirt up your floor.

444
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:52,821
Well, bring that child in.

445
00:59:56,035 --> 00:59:58,515
Come on, let's dry you all.

446
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:24,613
Mrs. Farell, I can filth my shirt until 
next week. - Good. How about your shirt?

447
01:00:25,227 --> 01:00:27,693
It's not my shirt, it's his.

448
01:00:28,162 --> 01:00:30,863
More coffee for Mr. Lomax, Dutch.

449
01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:33,952
Where do you go to school?

450
01:00:34,304 --> 01:00:38,707
- I don't go anymore. I'm all through.
- So soon?

451
01:00:39,764 --> 01:00:44,297
- Where did you go before you graduated?
- Kansas City, Kansas.

452
01:00:44,498 --> 01:00:47,063
Oh my, that must've been 
very interesting.

453
01:00:47,363 --> 01:00:51,378
- You got a school around here close?
- No, sir. Ma has been teaching me at home.

454
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,891
Next year he starts at Gun Hill.

455
01:00:57,182 --> 01:01:01,726
I like coffee, and I'm almost as 
old as you are. - Sure.

456
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:10,561
That isn't real coffee. That's what 
my momma calls tender coffee.

457
01:01:10,681 --> 01:01:13,297
It'll be tough enough 
to get it into you.

458
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:25,799
- Where are you gonna sleep?
- In here with you. We won't crowd each.

459
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:30,416
- Where is he gonna sleep?
- There a tow bed in Dutch's room.

460
01:01:30,874 --> 01:01:33,708
Is that what you call Mr. Lomax, "He"?

461
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:39,919
- His first name is Clay, but I don't call him much.
- Now don't you get too settled down there.

462
01:01:40,662 --> 01:01:45,817
- I got to be moving on the minute this rain quits.
- Oh that won't be for a while yet.

463
01:01:46,098 --> 01:01:50,830
The creek is up. And that means my boys
won't be back until tomorrow morning.

464
01:01:51,717 --> 01:01:54,382
You just settle down all
you want to, my dear.

465
01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:07,232
That is a real nice woman
for a lady.

466
01:02:08,174 --> 01:02:12,305
She's bringing her boy up right, 
and she's got a fine place here.

467
01:02:13,321 --> 01:02:17,712
- Not a bad spot to hold out.
- And a nice hayloft to play in.

468
01:02:17,832 --> 01:02:23,201
- Like it's not? - Not for me, she 
says "my dear". But I'm not her dear.

469
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:26,841
Go to sleep.

470
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:30,884
- You're not gonna skin out on me?
- Go to sleep.

471
01:02:31,004 --> 01:02:35,123
- I won't stay here.
- You'll stay where I plant you.

472
01:02:37,602 --> 01:02:40,338
Oh, what's that letter? 
The first one?

473
01:02:41,618 --> 01:02:47,031
- It's an A. - What's the next one?
- M. - How do you know?

474
01:02:47,562 --> 01:02:52,224
- I can read and can also write.
- How about arithmetic?

475
01:02:52,552 --> 01:02:56,274
Numbers? Well...
I worked in banks.

476
01:02:56,961 --> 01:03:02,656
- I bet there's still things I could teach you.
Lots of things - You go to sleep, damn it!

477
01:03:03,128 --> 01:03:06,978
You're in a big damn hurry,
just to get out there to her.

478
01:03:07,179 --> 01:03:11,124
No pasting!
Or I'll soap your mouth.

479
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:01,983
- That's a lot of guns going there. You want 
me them to hole them down? - No, thanks son.

480
01:04:02,441 --> 01:04:03,967
Just leave it be.

481
01:04:05,033 --> 01:04:08,755
- I'm going to bed. Good night, sir!
- Good night!

482
01:04:09,882 --> 01:04:14,967
- If you're gonna burn coal my friend take one 
of your school books. - I ain't that wide awake.

483
01:04:47,787 --> 01:04:52,847
- He looks like a fair enough boy.
- He's got his flaws, but he is my son.

484
01:04:58,699 --> 01:05:03,454
- Yo do that pretty handy.
- Actually, I'm a bit rusty.

485
01:05:03,971 --> 01:05:08,655
It's the first time I pour a drink for 
a man since my husbands died, five years.

486
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,772
Is Decky your daughter?

487
01:05:13,453 --> 01:05:17,117
What would you say?

488
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:21,027
One minute, yeah, but
the next minute...

489
01:05:23,076 --> 01:05:25,471
Well, I ain't sure myself.

490
01:05:27,168 --> 01:05:31,560
- Is any man ever sure?
- Now ell, with some women...

491
01:05:33,121 --> 01:05:37,360
Do you really believe that or 
do you just want to believe it?

492
01:05:40,057 --> 01:05:42,840
That child troubles you, doesn't she?

493
01:05:46,945 --> 01:05:49,176
I guess I feel sorry for her.

494
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:55,599
She'd be mad as hell if she knew that, 
but she don't even know how little she is.

495
01:05:56,377 --> 01:06:00,804
It seems to me she shied off pity,
like most people.

496
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:22,411
I've trying to find somewhere to board her.
I'd pay. - I'd keep her for you.

497
01:06:22,531 --> 01:06:26,768
- No pay.
- I'd have to pay as long as I could.

498
01:06:27,063 --> 01:06:30,938
There is something that 
might come up to prevent.

499
01:06:33,419 --> 01:06:35,449
You're a generous woman.

500
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:40,045
I'm selfish.
This is a female practicality.

501
01:06:40,795 --> 01:06:46,654
- If you leave her here, you'll come back.
- Cards on the table, I might keep on moving.

502
01:06:47,688 --> 01:06:49,425
I'll take that gamble.

503
01:07:08,396 --> 01:07:14,313
I could tell you a tale about
being a wandering Willie.

504
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,752
I'd make you some 
damn sweet promises.

505
01:07:19,814 --> 01:07:22,185
But there is that kid in there.

506
01:07:24,862 --> 01:07:26,694
You ought to know it all.

507
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:32,615
- You look at a man that just got out of the pin.
- You don't have to tell me anything.

508
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:36,102
You better know about this.

509
01:07:37,285 --> 01:07:42,100
Seven years ago
my partner and I picked a bank.

510
01:07:57,666 --> 01:08:00,472
My partner, my friend...

511
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,676
call it double-cross, 
call it betrayal.

512
01:08:07,156 --> 01:08:11,031
Now you see there's 
something I got to do.

513
01:08:12,807 --> 01:08:18,396
- And it might put me back there.
- I'll take that chance.

514
01:08:21,053 --> 01:08:24,963
You sound like a man 
offering a man a job.

515
01:08:25,386 --> 01:08:27,299
I'm not a man.

516
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:33,337
The offer stands.
I'll keep the child.

517
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:37,435
And there will be no more 
talk about tomorrow.

518
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:42,616
Throw the dice, took the coin.
Come with me.

519
01:08:43,241 --> 01:08:48,643
It's always now, really. 
Isn't it Clay?

520
01:09:09,425 --> 01:09:13,159
I said I hadn't poured a drink 
for a man for five years.

521
01:09:14,521 --> 01:09:16,188
That's true.

522
01:09:18,161 --> 01:09:21,132
But when my workmen are
in the bunkhouse...

523
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:25,515
...and Dutch is in his bed, I pour.

524
01:09:25,956 --> 01:09:29,619
For me. Until I'm drunk.

525
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:32,683
Do you understand?

526
01:09:34,776 --> 01:09:39,296
Until I'm drunk enough to 
turn off the tomorrows.

527
01:09:40,294 --> 01:09:44,333
And a little bit more 
to turn off the now.

528
01:09:46,063 --> 01:09:49,033
And a little bit more to sleep alone.

529
01:10:15,221 --> 01:10:19,823
- Leaving to a rain bull-party on a dry ground!
- You didn't do like I told you.

530
01:10:19,943 --> 01:10:25,916
- Like you told me? Pepe, get the arms.
- You're a pissin' punk.

531
01:10:26,136 --> 01:10:32,120
- I should have stepped on you back there.
- You'll be sorry, you didn't do that.

532
01:10:32,952 --> 01:10:38,212
- Do you know them? - Not like he's good.
- You got your guns, keep on traveling.

533
01:10:38,332 --> 01:10:43,889
Gun Hill is just down the road. It got 
two whorehouses, a hotel and Sam Foley.

534
01:10:46,084 --> 01:10:49,433
- Is there anybody in there?
- There's nobody your size.

535
01:11:05,524 --> 01:11:07,308
Get in here!

536
01:11:24,556 --> 01:11:28,466
- The is nobody in that bunkhouse.
- I have four men working in this ranch.

537
01:11:28,586 --> 01:11:32,804
- They'll be back from town, any time now.
- Oh, now I'm getting scared!

538
01:11:32,924 --> 01:11:37,172
They'll be liquored up, carrying
their guns. I'd get out of here.

539
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:41,405
- Is there any guns in there?
- No, sir. - I believe you.

540
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:43,976
You gonna take a look, Skeeter.

541
01:11:45,482 --> 01:11:50,660
- Are there any guns in that other room?
- No. - Now, I believe you too.

542
01:11:50,895 --> 01:11:54,734
But Skeeter won't.
You take a good look, Skeeter!

543
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:05,183
Go on, take a look in there.

544
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:10,877
- I got rid of them guns, put horses in 
the barn. - I've got another job for you.

545
01:12:10,997 --> 01:12:13,747
- Well, make it quick, I'm hungry.
- Quick?

546
01:12:14,696 --> 01:12:17,583
That dummy here wants me 
to make it quick.

547
01:12:17,626 --> 01:12:21,606
That old man got us all
while him sleeping on duty.

548
01:12:21,726 --> 01:12:24,911
- Can you imagine that?
- Bobby Jay, don't start that again.

549
01:12:25,031 --> 01:12:30,406
You will ride one mile down to Gun Hill,
and you will sit out in that rain and wait.

550
01:12:30,526 --> 01:12:36,494
And if you see any ranch-hands ridings up,
you're gonna fire your gun 3 times and come here.

551
01:12:36,614 --> 01:12:39,746
- Damn!
- You said what?

552
01:12:41,933 --> 01:12:45,138
- Nothing.
- Cover them.

553
01:12:48,769 --> 01:12:51,476
Make them go away.

554
01:12:51,936 --> 01:12:55,744
- Is that old man your hero?
- Yeah!

555
01:12:56,181 --> 01:13:00,023
He was better than all of you together! 
So you better watch out!

556
01:13:00,143 --> 01:13:05,002
Don't you know he's just an old
jail-bird and yeller!

557
01:13:05,203 --> 01:13:07,040
He's not yeller!

558
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:15,745
He's not do nothing. And I was slapping 
you, he still wouldn't do nothing.

559
01:13:15,865 --> 01:13:20,976
- 'Cause you got guns!
- You cook. You do tend the horses.

560
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,912
That's right, baby, we got the guns!

561
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:29,068
Don't unsaddle them, 
just grain. Move, boy!

562
01:13:33,995 --> 01:13:37,087
- What's she to you?
- She's my mother.

563
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:41,656
If you be back in 10 minutes, 
I'll shoot you in the kidneys.

564
01:13:42,059 --> 01:13:44,947
I told you it we'd have some fun.

565
01:13:45,628 --> 01:13:47,801
Fun? I didn't even laugh
since I met you.

566
01:13:47,921 --> 01:13:50,290
Now is that a way to 
talk to your man?

567
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:55,474
My man, wouldn't let me stand about 
in wet clothes. - You'd take them off.

568
01:13:58,013 --> 01:14:03,320
Come on do that over by that fireplace so 
I could watch you all nice and rosy.

569
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,634
Come on, do that thing!

570
01:14:09,709 --> 01:14:11,810
Not in front of the children!

571
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:17,752
You just keep cooking, Mama!
You ain't no angel!

572
01:14:17,872 --> 01:14:22,804
- I've seen that through the window. 
Didn't see it all, though. - Well, we will.

573
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:26,620
- Don't push your luck!
- Get over there.

574
01:14:28,576 --> 01:14:30,384
Move!

575
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:54,653
We'll be happy!

576
01:15:00,711 --> 01:15:03,917
He Mama, you got a leaky roof!

577
01:15:04,037 --> 01:15:07,204
You better patch that thing!

578
01:15:07,324 --> 01:15:12,544
Hey, we're supposed having a party, Mama.
Why don't we eat from these fancy dishes?

579
01:15:12,664 --> 01:15:18,620
- No, they belonged to my grandmother. - Then, 
they're too old! They've been here long enough.

580
01:15:22,931 --> 01:15:27,088
Look at that hand! Sometimes 
I don't think it's me at all.

581
01:15:27,346 --> 01:15:29,678
- That little boy, Pepe...
- Huh?

582
01:15:29,879 --> 01:15:33,469
- What about him? - I'll bet you 
a dollar he'd done the smart thing.

583
01:15:33,648 --> 01:15:37,270
- Such as what?
- He cut out. - Shut up!

584
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:42,568
Now Pepe is stupid. Too stupid 
to come in out of the rain.

585
01:15:42,688 --> 01:15:45,353
- I'll bet another dollar he is dry.
- What?

586
01:15:45,554 --> 01:15:50,111
- In the rain? - Rain, hell. 
He's in Sam Foley's house by now.

587
01:15:50,702 --> 01:15:56,597
- Maybe we got to ride on in, huh? - That man 
is trying to pull your leg. And to split us up.

588
01:15:56,717 --> 01:15:59,705
Goddamn, let's get on with it.
Let's get some fun.

589
01:15:59,906 --> 01:16:03,986
Mama, give me that cup up there, 
gimme the one with roses on it.

590
01:16:12,436 --> 01:16:14,702
Oh come on, Mama!

591
01:16:19,337 --> 01:16:25,283
Have you folk ever heard of the Switzer 
that got the apple up on the son's head?

592
01:16:26,302 --> 01:16:29,144
By the name of William Tell.

593
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:35,167
- What we need is a son! And we got one!
- No!

594
01:16:36,984 --> 01:16:39,685
Now I bet we can use you.

595
01:16:41,834 --> 01:16:45,004
Now I didn't hear you say "no"!

596
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:52,201
Well, our story says it was a 
kid's head. So any kid will do.

597
01:16:52,495 --> 01:16:54,737
So you can say which one.

598
01:16:58,226 --> 01:17:02,911
- Alright then, I'll pick the head. 
- Not him!

599
01:17:04,722 --> 01:17:09,243
- Okay, then you, over by the fire place.
- Why don't you use my head?

600
01:17:11,744 --> 01:17:13,540
Move!

601
01:17:20,556 --> 01:17:23,304
Go on. 
Put this cup on her head.

602
01:17:23,621 --> 01:17:26,345
Then put it on your own kid!

603
01:17:42,689 --> 01:17:46,569
Well, what do you know! 
A little lady gun! Damn!

604
01:17:46,629 --> 01:17:49,092
But somebody forgot to 
put the caps in!

605
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:52,308
Oh, I wanted him to see this.

606
01:17:54,472 --> 01:17:58,504
- That is shooting!
- No, my hand was aiming at the handle.

607
01:17:58,658 --> 01:18:01,811
Wasn't you aiming at the handle?

608
01:18:02,072 --> 01:18:07,098
Okay boy, you give me the next cup. 
Gimme the one with the flowers on it.

609
01:18:18,442 --> 01:18:20,309
Scaredy cat.

610
01:18:21,249 --> 01:18:25,194
No! You little son-of-a-bitch!
You leave her...

611
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:45,475
I think that rain has gone let off.

612
01:18:48,296 --> 01:18:54,249
Okay, Mama! Next! Give me the 
one with the daisies on it!

613
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:56,703
Well...

614
01:19:12,291 --> 01:19:15,778
Well, what's the hell 
the matter with you?

615
01:19:17,933 --> 01:19:23,592
Oh, I see, sure. It says 
I need a little nerve-tighter.

616
01:19:33,049 --> 01:19:38,403
What do you think Alma, you think my 
shooting hand is steady enough to perform?

617
01:19:38,771 --> 01:19:42,282
I can not stand the sight
of you in those clothes.

618
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:46,852
Before you do take them off, 
you get to shoot the next one.

619
01:19:47,498 --> 01:19:48,883
Come on!

620
01:19:51,956 --> 01:19:54,645
Do you want to try? Huh?

621
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:23,376
Drop that, Lomax!
I said 1...

622
01:20:23,825 --> 01:20:27,712
No, don't! He's got one shot left! 
He shot the floor,

623
01:20:27,994 --> 01:20:30,917
two teacups, her and him, 
that's five shots!

624
01:20:31,037 --> 01:20:34,938
Shut up and get over there!
One is all I need!

625
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:40,234
Now you know I don't mess around, Lomax.
You stand there until you hear my horse.

626
01:20:40,354 --> 01:20:44,434
You move, and she stops moving.

627
01:20:48,473 --> 01:20:50,105
Get out the lights.

628
01:20:57,881 --> 01:21:00,088
My gun is on the table.

629
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:09,660
About Decky ad my son...
I had to make that choice.

630
01:21:10,071 --> 01:21:15,226
If it had been the other way around, 
I'd probably had done the same.

631
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:37,382
Put on your clothes, 
I'll get the horses!

632
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,406
No! He is lame!

633
01:22:40,613 --> 01:22:46,026
- Ain't they coming? What do you do with 
that kid? - Get down! I need your horse!

634
01:22:46,146 --> 01:22:48,926
This is my horse! I wouldn't let you 
ride to Gun Hill on my horse!

635
01:22:49,046 --> 01:22:54,110
He's a good horse! And you'll only kill him, 
the way you kill everything you lay your hand to!

636
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:57,397
You should not have said that, Pepe!

637
01:23:06,783 --> 01:23:08,814
You really shouldn't have, Pepe.

638
01:23:38,271 --> 01:23:39,821
Decky!

639
01:23:41,585 --> 01:23:42,912
Decky!

640
01:23:46,085 --> 01:23:48,375
Wait! Here I am!

641
01:23:53,802 --> 01:23:55,423
Wait!

642
01:23:55,658 --> 01:23:57,419
Here I am!

643
01:24:00,436 --> 01:24:02,092
Wait!

644
01:24:34,121 --> 01:24:37,315
That is the God's truth, Mr. Foley.

645
01:24:41,467 --> 01:24:46,575
- Want a cup of coffee?
- I'd prefer to have a drink of that whiskey?

646
01:24:47,369 --> 01:24:48,778
It's over there.

647
01:24:50,734 --> 01:24:54,667
I'm really sorry that I have been
tracking up your nice floor.

648
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:58,650
That's bad news, Bobby Jay.

649
01:24:59,695 --> 01:25:02,185
I'm sorry to hear that.

650
01:25:03,021 --> 01:25:05,217
Now sir, you did say he was trouble.

651
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:08,493
But that order of yours
about not shooting....

652
01:25:09,024 --> 01:25:12,652
Mr. Foley, I lost my two best friends
because of that order.

653
01:25:12,772 --> 01:25:17,391
Why don't you go on over to the hotel, 
get a hot bath and some sleep.

654
01:25:17,592 --> 01:25:19,540
We'll settle this later.

655
01:25:19,773 --> 01:25:22,286
From now on, I'll take care 
of Clay Lomax.

656
01:25:22,406 --> 01:25:26,725
If it's all the same to you, sir, 
I prefer my money now.

657
01:25:29,951 --> 01:25:31,360
All right.

658
01:25:39,857 --> 01:25:42,443
Why didn't you want him shot?

659
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:46,482
- Why? You?
- Yeah, by me.

660
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:50,307
I've killed men before,
Mr. Foley, no complaints.

661
01:25:51,468 --> 01:25:55,496
So I've  heard. So has 
everybody heard it from you.

662
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,392
When you buy a killing, Bobby Jay,
you sell yourself.

663
01:26:00,512 --> 01:26:04,500
A reliable professional killer 
is a closed mouth.

664
01:26:04,746 --> 01:26:10,312
Me, I'm a business man, with a 
reputation to protect. Understand?

665
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:15,094
Oh no, sir. That's putting it real nice.
I mean I know my place.

666
01:26:15,672 --> 01:26:21,672
- What are you gonna do when Lomax gets here?
- I'm gonna ask him to come in and sit down.

667
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:26,362
Give him a drink and cigar and say: 
Well, Clay, what's on your mind?

668
01:26:26,482 --> 01:26:30,172
I loose two men and you'll 
get Lomax a cigar?

669
01:26:30,373 --> 01:26:33,101
A drink and a cigar.

670
01:26:33,335 --> 01:26:34,992
Now, here! 100...

671
01:26:37,105 --> 01:26:39,289
Two hundred. That's double 
what I told you. Now get out!

672
01:26:39,536 --> 01:26:44,667
What about Pepe and Skeeter? 
What am I gonna their poor families?

673
01:26:50,959 --> 01:26:56,677
I also lost a horse. And a rifle,
and a couple of handguns.

674
01:27:04,416 --> 01:27:06,376
Who the hell are you?

675
01:27:07,532 --> 01:27:09,564
I keep house for Mr. Foley.

676
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:11,759
Is there anyone else to home?

677
01:27:12,746 --> 01:27:15,247
Alright. Get over by that window.

678
01:27:15,406 --> 01:27:19,938
If anybody gets in, you're gonna 
get the same thing a your boss got.

679
01:27:30,748 --> 01:27:34,107
Get that bag you're carrying
and bring it on over here!

680
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:11,428
Having more fun? I like fun too. 
Much as the next man.

681
01:28:11,548 --> 01:28:13,919
But I get less of it.

682
01:28:18,549 --> 01:28:23,985
- Here. We split it right down the middle.
- Where is Decky?

683
01:28:24,434 --> 01:28:28,144
Well... put that gun away
and I will tell you.

684
01:28:29,236 --> 01:28:30,657
Get over here!

685
01:28:32,198 --> 01:28:33,677
Right there.

686
01:28:39,539 --> 01:28:43,190
Now I don't see any 
fancy teacups around,

687
01:28:43,391 --> 01:28:46,297
but I do see an apple in that bowl.

688
01:28:46,784 --> 01:28:48,205
Get it.

689
01:28:49,042 --> 01:28:50,287
Get it!

690
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:58,553
Put it on his head and 
don't get between us.

691
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:13,120
Did you ever hear of the Switzer
name of William Tell?

692
01:29:16,445 --> 01:29:21,024
I'm gonna give you a chance. 
I'm gonna put this gun away.

693
01:29:21,283 --> 01:29:26,848
Then I'm gonna draw and I'm gonna
shoot that apple off your head.

694
01:29:27,486 --> 01:29:31,936
If you think you can
stop me, you draw.

695
01:29:38,504 --> 01:29:43,424
- She ran off when I was changing horses!
- She ran where? - I don't know.

696
01:29:45,576 --> 01:29:47,220
Fun?!

697
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:51,235
You had a lot of fun with
them kids, didn't you?

698
01:29:51,576 --> 01:29:55,098
Put one of them little 
whiskey glasses on his head.

699
01:30:04,117 --> 01:30:07,722
Here is your second chance to draw.

700
01:30:23,082 --> 01:30:24,867
Next target...

701
01:30:25,102 --> 01:30:28,495
I'm gonna supply 
the next one myself.

702
01:30:28,615 --> 01:30:33,203
You're gonna appreciate this 
because you like fun so damn much.

703
01:30:33,586 --> 01:30:34,924
Ma'am!

704
01:30:35,044 --> 01:30:40,055
Now you keep to him one side and 
balance this cartridge on his head.

705
01:30:40,772 --> 01:30:41,911
Take it!

706
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:03,242
I'm gonna make you draw, punk!

707
01:31:03,362 --> 01:31:07,833
Because I want to see you the way
Trooper saw it. Fun and jokes!

708
01:31:07,953 --> 01:31:09,729
And here's the catch:

709
01:31:09,976 --> 01:31:14,895
If you don't draw and I hit that cartridge, 
it's gonna blow your head off.

710
01:31:15,015 --> 01:31:19,961
I could miss, that's 
a lot smaller than a teacup.

711
01:31:20,677 --> 01:31:23,836
And you're a lot bigger 
than a little girl.

712
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:30,487
Oh? What's the matter?

713
01:31:31,476 --> 01:31:32,568
Huh?

714
01:31:33,965 --> 01:31:36,408
It says it needs some nerve-tonic.

715
01:31:36,528 --> 01:31:40,555
You can kill me, 
but don't stand there mocking me now!

716
01:31:40,675 --> 01:31:44,019
Shoot me or give me a chance!

717
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:47,421
Come on, you wanna give me a chance?

718
01:31:48,571 --> 01:31:50,192
Are you all right, huh?

719
01:31:50,567 --> 01:31:53,843
Are you ready to give him a chance?

720
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:02,278
It says it's ready.

721
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,737
Fetch the laws.

722
01:33:15,554 --> 01:33:20,532
I see you've finally got a new hat.
That's not a Texas hat either.

723
01:33:20,652 --> 01:33:23,356
- Oh, what about it?
- Oh, nothing.

724
01:33:26,482 --> 01:33:31,519
- Are you my father? - You asked me that 
before. Are you gonna start that again?

725
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:35,869
Not if you don't want me to.
But why did you come back?

726
01:33:37,501 --> 01:33:39,779
I'm damned if I know.
