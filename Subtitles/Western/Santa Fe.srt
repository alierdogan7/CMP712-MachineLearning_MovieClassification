1
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,640
{y:i}With malice toward none
and charity for all.

2
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,000
{y:i}This the great man said
{y:i}at Gettysburg.

3
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,120
{y:i}Yet after four long years of strife and
{y:i}battle between the North and South...

4
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,800
{y:i}... the malice still remained...

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,680
{y:i}... and charity
{y:i}was a forgotten word.

6
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,120
{y:i}Peace came...

7
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,040
{y:i}... but the soldier returned
{y:i}to a ravaged land...

8
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,120
{y:i}... to homes
{y:i}which had been destroyed...

9
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,360
{y:i}... to children who no longer
{y:i}recognized their fathers...

10
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,320
{y:i}... to families
{y:i}who were now strangers.

11
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,480
{y:i}Still others found less...

12
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,760
{y:i}... not even the welcoming hand
{y:i}nor the friendly smile.

13
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,400
{y:i}Only the dull apathy of despair...

14
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,800
{y:i}... a torn and bleeding nation...

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,160
{y:i}... at the lowest ebb in its history.

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,320
{y:i}With the restlessness born of war,
{y:i}men of both the blue and the gray...

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,200
{y:i}... sought distant ground
{y:i}in which to plant their roots.

18
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,960
{y:i}But not all could forget...

19
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,680
{y:i}... and in many of them,
{y:i}the flame of hatred still burned.

20
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,680
Didn't know the war got
this far north in Missouri.

21
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,040
Didn't get far enough north
to suit me.

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
Maybe we should've stayed
back in Virginia.

23
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,040
Poor land up here.
Folks are even poorer.

24
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,520
How can they be poor?
They won, didn't they?

25
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,240
Don't start that again, Clint.

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,680
Better water the horses
and wet our own throats.

27
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,360
Plumb frightened her.

28
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,720
I guess the gents up here
don't bow to ladies.

29
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,640
Something long and cool that bites.

30
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,600
Sweet cider is his limit.

31
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,960
All we got's whiskey.

32
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,280
Well, give me whiskey.

33
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,440
About time you all realized
I'm not a kid any longer.

34
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,600
Hey, you, with the striped pants.

35
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,080
You're a Johnny Reb, ain't you?

36
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,760
You mean, are we from the South?
What about it?

37
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,920
Be careful how you talk, Reb.

38
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,960
Army for army, we beat you good,
and man for man, we can lick you now.

39
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,760
Well, now, mister...!

40
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,400
No need to get steamed up, friend.
The war's over, so let's forget it.

41
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,840
We're looking for some land where we
can settle down to work again in peace.

42
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,280
Maybe we ain't so sure.

43
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,000
What's your name?
Where you come from?

44
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
We're the Canfields.

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
We owned the biggest plantation
in Virginny.

46
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,320
It doesn't matter what we owned.
We haven't got it now.

47
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,680
- How much?
- I don't take counterfeit money.

48
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,720
Counterfeit?
You haven't even looked at it.

49
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,720
I said, it's counterfeit.
Now, get out of here, all of you!

50
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,160
Look here...

51
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,600
No trouble, Clint. Let's move.

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,600
I ain't never seen a Reb yet
that would walk when he could crawl.

53
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah, that's what they do.

54
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,520
Every one I ever seen crawled.

55
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Dirty drunken Yanks.
None of you can call yourself a man.

56
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,640
All right, come on.

57
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,280
Come on, let's get out of here.

58
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,560
Here's four more.

59
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:09,600
Since the beginning of time,
man's growth in civilization...

60
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,760
Since the beginning of time,
man's growth in civilization...

61
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,840
...has been in the story
of transportation.

62
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,320
Our beginning is in
the few meager miles of track...

63
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,960
...over which you've ridden out here
to Wakarusa Grove from Topeka.

64
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,040
But the rails will not stop.

65
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,840
They'll go on to reach the old pueblo
of Santa Fe, New Mexico...

66
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,400
...then onward westward to California
to touch the waters of the blue Pacific...

67
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,320
...to meet the ships
bearing treasures from the Orient.

68
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,640
What's he been drinking?

69
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,160
When I find out, I'll send you a case.
Maybe it'll broaden your own vision.

70
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,120
It will not be easy...

71
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,240
...but nothing but a railroad
will make this new empire...

72
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,080
...a part of an expanding America.

73
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,680
I know that among you workmen
who will build the Santa Fe...

74
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,040
...there are many who come
from both the North and the South...

75
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,400
...and I ask all you now to put aside
your differences for all time...

76
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,600
...in the interest of a good
and common cause.

77
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,080
And to this end, that you join with me
in repeating the oath of allegiance...

78
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,760
...from President Johnson's
Amnesty Proclamation.

79
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,200
I'm sure Colonel Holliday
doesn't need the ladies.

80
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,200
Why don't you take them down
and get dinner prepared.

81
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,400
Hold up your right hand.

82
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,320
I do solemnly swear
in the presence of almighty God...

83
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,280
...that I will faithfully support,
protect and defend...

84
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,920
...the Constitution
of the United States...

85
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,920
...and the union of states
thereunder...

86
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,760
...and that I will in like manner
abide by and faithfully support...

87
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,480
...all laws and proclamations
made during the Rebellion.

88
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,280
Hey, what's wrong with you?

89
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,960
We're wanted men.
This is our chance for a new life.

90
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,760
Say, aren't you Britt Canfield?

91
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,600
You've mixed me up
with somebody else.

92
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,400
I'd know you anywhere, Canfield.

93
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,160
The name's Remley. John Remley.

94
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,720
That's right, mister.
I'm a friend of his.

95
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,000
But I'm positive.

96
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,280
I know him too.
You've made a mistake.

97
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,080
You rode with White's Raiders.

98
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,320
I was a major in the Federals
under Gen. Sheridan.

99
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,600
Last time I saw you was when you
hit our lines at Parsons Creek.

100
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,120
Of course, I guess all you saw of us
that afternoon was our heels.

101
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,480
You've got a pretty good memory.

102
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,240
We were in luck.
We had the element of surprise, major.

103
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,600
Not major anymore,
just plain Dave Baxter.

104
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,200
Now, why all this Remley business?

105
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,640
A man who rode
with Confederate guerrillas...

106
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
...might have trouble
making friends here.

107
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,960
- That's gone. Let's forget it.
- I'd like to.

108
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,520
Well, I'd better report.

109
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,800
I'm certain I could find a good job
for a man like you, captain.

110
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,880
- You're the boss?
- I am here at end of track.

111
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,960
I'm building this line
for Colonel Holliday.

112
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,040
See me at the engineering car
first thing in the morning.

113
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,280
How about it? Do we stick together?

114
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,320
With a lot of Yankees?

115
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,600
Clint, you've gotta stop fighting a war
that doesn't exist.

116
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,240
You've got to forget it.

117
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,320
Forget it?
You think they've forgotten?

118
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,480
I'll always remember what the Yanks
did to the South, to us.

119
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,240
- I know, I know.
- And for that, I'll hate them all my life.

120
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,320
Clint's right.

121
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,160
Clint, Tom, you too, Terry,
you've gotta get this in your minds:

122
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,520
We fought for something
we believed in and lost.

123
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,320
Now we've got to mend our fences.

124
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,360
Hate won't help us any.

125
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,160
Neither will what you're doing.

126
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,440
I'm always interested in men
who think for themselves.

127
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,840
And there are easier ways...

128
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,960
...to make money off of
a Yankee railroad than by laying track.

129
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,080
I'm not cut out for this type of work.

130
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,120
I ought to be an engineer.

131
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,360
Takes this to handle an engine.

132
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,000
Your head just matches
what you're handling.

133
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,280
Gotta have your wits with you
every minute.

134
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,800
Make one little mistake,
and you just lose everything.

135
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,280
Look at all these gadgets.

136
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,800
Takes brains to know
what each one of them's for...

137
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,480
...when to push and when to pull.

138
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,600
You ought to be thankful you're
working with a man like me, Dan.

139
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,160
See what I mean?

140
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,480
Get into it, there,
you sorghum lappers.

141
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,200
Come on, there.

142
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,280
Yeah! Come on,
you sorghum lappers.

143
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,120
Come on!

144
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,480
We'll be waiting for you.

145
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,960
Sure wish we were there now.

146
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,600
- The pay train.
- Keep on working, you fools.

147
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,440
I was looking for Thompson,
the paymaster.

148
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,920
I've been expecting you.

149
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,680
- I'm the paymaster now.
- You?

150
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,840
Didn't Dave tell you?
I'm Judith Chandler.

151
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,680
Glad to know you.

152
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,560
Here's a list of men we've hired,
along with those who are sick...

153
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,320
...those who have deductions coming,
and so forth.

154
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,640
Thank you.

155
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,600
Is something wrong?

156
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,040
No. In the South...

157
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,640
...we don't usually see a woman
doing a man's work.

158
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,400
We women of the North
are a little different.

159
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,840
So are the men.

160
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,880
My husband. Dave tells me
he knew you through the war.

161
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,280
You were in Major Baxter's regiment.
You must have known Tony.

162
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,600
No, ma'am. You see, l...
I wasn't exactly with Major Baxter.

163
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,400
Our uniforms were
of a different color.

164
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,280
Canfield.

165
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,520
- Now I remember.
- I don't understand.

166
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,720
Tony was killed in the war,
Captain Canfield...

167
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,960
...at Parsons Creek,
in the charge that you led.

168
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,920
I'm sorry. Deeply sorry.

169
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,400
Sorry? Tony and Dave
were very good friends.

170
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,080
They dreamed of the railroad
along with Colonel Holliday.

171
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,080
Tony was to have been
Dave's assistant.

172
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,680
They planned together
to cross the prairies...

173
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,120
...mountains, build bridges.

174
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,800
Bridges that Tony will never cross.

175
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,480
Mrs. Chandler, the war's over.

176
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,160
It doesn't do any of us any good
to personalize it.

177
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,960
I'm sure you feel if it weren't for me,
your husband would be here now, but...

178
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,000
He would be, wouldn't he?

179
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,440
I'm sorry you feel that way.

180
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,360
Now, here's what we're up against.

181
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,960
Along this 300-mile strip
is a 2-million-acre land grant...

182
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,960
...that's coming to
the Santa Fe Railroad...

183
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,520
...if we reach
the Kansas-Colorado border...

184
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,400
...by next March 1 st.

185
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,360
We must have that land grant
to finance the road...

186
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,880
...and unless we reach the state line
in time, the Santa Fe's dead.

187
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,880
Then, Dave, we'll just have to
get there in time.

188
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,800
All the men are paid
and accounted for.

189
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,680
- Sorry there's no money left.
- We certainly could use it.

190
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,480
By the way, Judith, I've just promoted
Britt here to be my assistant.

191
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,520
Assistant?

192
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,360
Congratulations, Mr. Canfield.

193
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,840
Thank you.

194
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,800
I'll let the men know what's ahead.

195
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,240
What's the matter?
Don't you approve of my choice?

196
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,680
Of course. Only now he's doing the job
that Tony would have done.

197
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,880
Judith, somebody has to take
Tony's place with the railroad.

198
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,320
Somebody has to take Tony's place
with you. And that's where I come in.

199
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,760
Not yet, Dave. We'll have to wait.

200
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,880
- Why?
- I just feel that way.

201
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,000
When a woman feels that way,
there's no point in arguing with her.

202
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,440
Just don't make the waiting too long.

203
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,920
- What's up?
- Nothing new.

204
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,440
Whenever that pay train rolls in,
'tis booze they smell.

205
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,080
- Well, it's 20 miles to a town.
- And so it is.

206
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,240
But some smart operators have
set up a saloon and gambling camp...

207
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,320
...about a mile back there
in the woods.

208
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,440
They've been following along
behind us for two or three weeks.

209
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,920
Tomorrow, what with all the headaches,
we'll not get 200 yards of track done.

210
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,240
Swede, I thought I told you to throw
that fellow off of railroad property.

211
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,000
Hey, you, come here.

212
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,240
By golly, I did throw him off once.

213
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,400
He's the dirty dog that's been
passing word on to the crews...

214
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,600
...telling them how to get
to that gambling camp.

215
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,440
Oh, he has, has he?

216
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,120
There's a good time waiting
for all you men just a mile away.

217
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,800
Go up till you see a red rock.
Follow your no...

218
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,040
Get away from this camp,
and keep away.

219
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,080
Britt! Britt!

220
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,520
- Trouble!
- What?

221
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,120
Indians.

222
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,880
Anybody know
what he's talking about?

223
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,520
I do. Says he wants to talk to you.

224
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,480
Well, ask him
what he's got on his mind.

225
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,800
He says the iron horse spits fire
and frightens his people.

226
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,200
Ask him if he's afraid.

227
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,680
He says, Of course not.

228
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,200
He's the greatest chief that is.
He's afraid of nothing.

229
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,960
If that's true, he can prove it
to us and his tribe...

230
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,400
...by driving the iron horse.

231
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,840
You've put him on the spot.
He won't dare lose face.

232
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,000
They're holding you hostage till
the chief gets back safe to his people.

233
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,360
Me?

234
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,360
He's good.

235
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,040
This engine don't run,
except on the tracks.

236
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,760
Stop this thing.

237
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,520
How do you say stop in Indian?

238
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,240
Try!

239
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,680
You were all right, chief.

240
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,640
Maybe someday
we'll name a train after you.

241
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,800
Well?

242
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,040
He's telling them that the Indian pony's
much better than the iron horse.

243
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,200
The iron horse
has to stay on one trail...

244
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,520
...and the Indian pony will
take them hunting anywhere.

245
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,400
He's gonna let the railroad alone.

246
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,160
Well, let's get back to work.
We can't make state line standing here.

247
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,840
- Dan.
- Yeah, yeah.

248
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,240
Ask him where he got
those bells on the tomahawk.

249
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,480
He said they was given to him
by a saloonkeeper.

250
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,200
Same fella that
gave him the whiskey.

251
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,680
Told him the iron rails
and singing wires was bad medicine.

252
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,600
I wonder who'd want to feed
these Indians lies about the railroad.

253
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,240
Yeah.

254
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,280
I wonder too.

255
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,560
Yes, sir.

256
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,520
Gambling hall and a saloon
right in their own wagons...

257
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,520
...following behind us
every time we move.

258
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,920
Half the crew are here.

259
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,080
There won't be a paycheck left.

260
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,760
They sure aren't helping
the Santa Fe any with this setup.

261
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,440
How about it? I feel lucky.

262
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,040
Like to buck the tiger?

263
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,120
Gamble? Not me.

264
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,880
Don't know the first thing
about gambling.

265
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,440
Thanks, Britt.
Where'd you find them?

266
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,480
You guess.

267
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,040
My brothers,
feeding liquor to the Indians.

268
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,840
When we split up, I didn't think
it'd be this far apart.

269
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,120
- What makes you think we had...?
- You're quite a man now, aren't you?

270
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,520
Big saloonkeeper and gambler,
just like your brothers.

271
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,840
In that letter you sent me, you said you
came out to get in on the land boom.

272
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,160
This is surer profit. Quicker.

273
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,520
For you, maybe,
but not for the Santa Fe.

274
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,520
We've got to reach Colorado
by March 1 st to get a land grant...

275
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,160
...or there won't be any railroad.

276
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,840
And we're not going to be delayed
just so an outfit can sell more liquor.

277
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm through trying to run your lives...

278
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,920
...so stay away from the Santa Fe
unless you want to work on it.

279
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,520
Tell that to your boss.

280
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,160
Why not tell me yourself, Canfield.

281
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,160
The name is Sanders. Cole Sanders.

282
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,640
Yes, l... I've already met
your chief salesman.

283
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,600
- Got a thing to settle with him.
- Crake.

284
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,240
Canfield, you're in
the railroad business...

285
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,360
...and we're in
the entertainment field.

286
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,680
Now, if you want to come in
and buy a drink...

287
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,400
...or gamble a dollar or two,
you're welcome.

288
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,440
But don't try telling me
how to operate.

289
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,880
I'm telling you to keep away
from the Santa Fe.

290
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,960
- Lf you're looking for trouble...
- That's exactly what I'm looking for.

291
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,400
Where are you going?

292
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,760
This is a private fight.

293
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,320
What's that?

294
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,800
Oh, probably one of them
drunks celebrating.

295
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,680
There she is, me boys.

296
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,320
- Good work, Moose.
- The state line.

297
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,000
- We made it!
- With less than 48 hours to spare too.

298
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,360
Now I know why railroaders
turn gray young.

299
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,080
And the land grant is ours.

300
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,120
No more financial worries,
for a while.

301
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,720
All right, boys.
A week's holiday for everyone.

302
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,480
The train leaves for Topeka
in the morning.

303
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,560
Thanks, sir!

304
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,160
Thank you.

305
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,840
What's this?

306
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,240
Thought you said
you never gambled.

307
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,600
Oh, these? Oh, I just carry them
around to tell my fortune with.

308
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,640
Oh, you should know something
about card games, Dan.

309
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,560
How would you like to have me
teach you how to play poker?

310
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,040
Oh, would you, Luke?

311
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,680
Don't think it'd be fun for you.

312
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,600
Forget it.
You're my friend, aren't you?

313
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,480
I'm glad.

314
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,080
My daddy told me you never
play cards with strangers.

315
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,640
How many?

316
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,240
I'll take four.

317
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,160
Mind if I cut them?

318
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,240
I'll play these.

319
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,000
Well, Mr. Plummer,
how much do you wager?

320
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,360
- I'll check.
- I'll bet all I got.

321
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,280
I think I'll raise.

322
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,840
Next time I play poker with you,
you're gonna have gloves on.

323
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
Luke! Dan!

324
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Come on, fellas. We got bad news.

325
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,480
What's the matter,
the whiskey all gone?

326
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,800
No, worse than that.
We gotta go to work.

327
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,840
A fella came in camp and said
we ain't reached the state line.

328
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,840
You're crazy.
The state line's out here.

329
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,640
That ain't what he said.
And he's a government surveyor.

330
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,120
Come on. Get out of here.

331
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,360
That's right, Britt.
We're short of track by four miles.

332
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,840
When I rode in tonight...

333
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,400
...I found your company surveyor
had made a mistake.

334
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,640
It's four miles to Colorado.

335
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,160
Our surveyor staked that line
days ago. Where is he?

336
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,240
Oh, he's in his tent now, passed out.

337
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,560
He was up in that saloon camp
for a week, drinking.

338
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,040
Pretty smart, aren't they?

339
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,600
They knew once we crossed
that state line, we'd get our land grant.

340
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,720
Then they'd have no place to set up
business except on railroad property.

341
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,800
Get the men out.
We've got work to do.

342
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,880
Come on. Get your clothes on.

343
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,400
Get moving. We've got work to do.

344
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,720
Get moving.

345
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,400
Come on, you spalpeens.
There's work to be done.

346
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,640
Men, we need four miles of track.

347
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,480
Four miles by tomorrow night.

348
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,240
So 'tis four miles of rails
he needs, is it?

349
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,760
We haven't even one.

350
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,680
That's right, Britt. Nor ties either.

351
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,040
Dave, does that
land-grant agreement...

352
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,800
...say anything about our road
being continuous track?

353
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,920
No, only that we run our line
into Colorado...

354
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,400
...by nightfall tomorrow.

355
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,680
Then we've got track, back there,
track which we've laid.

356
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,160
Tear it up, rails and ties.
Four miles of it. Move it up.

357
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,880
You graders, get busy.

358
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,960
Rest of you men, get on those flats.
Make it fast.

359
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,120
Come on. Get moving, you spalpeen.

360
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,560
Come on, you, get moving.

361
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,000
Britt's a man who thinks on his feet.
That's what I like.

362
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,440
You know, I think he'll do it.

363
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,480
You've changed toward Canfield.
You've stopped resenting him.

364
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,600
I never did resent him as a person.
Only what he stood for.

365
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,120
Glad to hear you say that, Judith.
Britt's a fine man.

366
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,480
I've got the fullest faith
and confidence in him.

367
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,880
I think of him more as a friend
than a fellow worker. He's got...

368
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,680
What am I doing?
I'm patting another man on the back...

369
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,280
...when I should be telling you
what a remarkably clever fellow I am.

370
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,200
You men, would you like to know
what we've been doing?

371
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,520
The toughest job we've ever done
on this line.

372
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,320
But we got it done without you.

373
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,000
Yes, we've done it without you!

374
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,080
Now, get out of here!

375
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,520
What are you doing?

376
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,080
Get out of here!

377
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,920
And me with aces full!

378
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,240
What did you want, tricking the road
into stopping short of the state line?

379
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,840
- What are you talking about?
- Getting our surveyor drunk.

380
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,880
You almost finished the Santa Fe.
Without that grant, you would've.

381
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,520
We didn't know about the surveyor.

382
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,880
- We wouldn't do that, honest.
- That's the truth.

383
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,240
What is this? I thought we had
talked this over once before.

384
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,240
I thought I'd convinced you
once before.

385
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,680
I still say let me run my affairs.

386
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,320
With my help.

387
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,520
- Ready?
- Now.

388
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,320
To commemorate
this special event...

389
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,240
...we now dedicate the new western
headquarters of the Santa Fe.

390
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,280
And so it is with extreme pride...

391
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,120
...that the Atchison, Topeka
& Santa Fe Railroad...

392
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,160
...announces the opening today...

393
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,760
...of regular, daily passenger
and freight service...

394
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,960
...between Atchison, Kansas
and your fair city.

395
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,960
Think of it, ladies and gentlemen.

396
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,360
Over 360 miles in 19 hours.

397
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
That's an average
of almost 20 miles per hour.

398
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,040
What is the fare, mister?

399
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,920
The fare?
Twenty dollars and 10 cents.

400
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,520
That's cheaper than walking
in those boots.

401
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,320
To the west, our road
runs another 300 miles.

402
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,800
But to your city, the railroad
has brought growth, prosperity...

403
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,760
...and a closeness
to the outside world...

404
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,360
...that otherwise would not
have been possible.

405
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,320
It'll do the same for other frontier
communities all over the continent.

406
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,360
Now, folks...

407
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,720
...inside you'll find all the beer
and sandwiches you can handle.

408
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,280
And it's all on the Santa Fe.

409
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,720
- Howdy, Britt.
- How are you, Johnson?

410
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,640
It's all right. She knows
all about the Canfields.

411
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,960
This is Ella Sue. My wife.

412
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,680
Your wife? When did this happen?

413
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,720
We've only been married
three months.

414
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,160
That's right.

415
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,160
Welcome to the family, Ella Sue.

416
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,320
- I'd say he's made a fine choice.
- Thank you.

417
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,000
- Hi, Britt.
- Well, it's been a long time, stranger.

418
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,360
What are you all doing
in Dodge City?

419
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,840
Not what you think.

420
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,040
We're partners in a little ranch
a mile out on the north road.

421
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,720
Shipping and buying
buffalo hides and bones.

422
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,680
- Big business.
- What happened to Sanders?

423
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,320
I don't know. We split up.

424
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,880
Well, I'm glad to see
you wild galoots...

425
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,000
...finally got some sense
and settled down.

426
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,080
We're only in this till we make
enough money to go back to Virginia.

427
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,040
We'll all go back. You with us.

428
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,200
No, I like what I'm doing. I'm staying.

429
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,040
That is, as long as they'll keep me.

430
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,960
- Oh, Judith.
- You sneaked out on me, Britt.

431
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,240
Mrs. Chandler, this is Ella Sue...
Mrs. Johnson.

432
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,960
Mr. Johnson, Mr. Clay
and Mr. Moore.

433
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,360
How do you do?

434
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
Why don't you come out
and join the celebration.

435
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,240
We're gonna have a dance
on the new station platform.

436
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,920
Well, sorry, ma'am,
but we've got livestock to tend to.

437
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,280
Oh, I am sorry.

438
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,120
Maybe you could come out
and visit us.

439
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,560
You too, Mrs. Chandler.
Later or tomorrow.

440
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,960
Not this trip. Leaving for end of track
first thing in the morning.

441
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,800
If we don't get a pay car out there,
our crews will lay down on the job.

442
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,320
Hope you do well
with those buffalo hides.

443
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,680
See you next time I'm in Dodge City.

444
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,800
- Old friends?
- Not particularly.

445
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,440
I thought they might be.
They sound Southern.

446
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,360
I must've had a loose coupling
to gamble even my job away to you.

447
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,120
No, it's just fate.
All in the cards, Luke.

448
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,160
Say, what'd you do
before you was a fireman?

449
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,800
- Used to work for a doctor.
- A doctor?

450
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Well, he sold medicine.

451
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,680
Dr. Dopley's Indian Remedy.

452
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,800
What'd you do,
mix up the medicine?

453
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,360
No, mix up the customers.

454
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,880
A cardsharp from a medicine show.

455
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,600
I should've known it.

456
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,760
We've stopped for water.

457
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,280
- How about a little walk?
- I'd love it.

458
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,600
Holdup!

459
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,360
- Holdup!
- The payroll.

460
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
Hold where you are.

461
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,840
Keep on your feet.

462
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,520
In there.

463
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,120
Who's the engineer?

464
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,080
- He is.
- Oh, no, him. Him's the engineer.

465
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,280
- He is.
- Him.

466
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,960
Shut up. Now, make up your minds.

467
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,760
- Didn't hear you knock.
- Because I didn't.

468
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,680
How long you been eating
with a gun on the table?

469
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,040
Sit down and eat.

470
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,640
Didn't expect to see you so soon.

471
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,960
Didn't you?

472
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,000
You boys had to do some hard
riding to beat that train back.

473
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,560
We haven't been anyplace.

474
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,120
Quit stalling.

475
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,000
You, Sanders, all of you...

476
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,040
...were in on that train holdup today.

477
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,400
- What holdup?
- Talk, Clint.

478
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,760
Don't start anything, Britt.

479
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,680
Maybe you know, Ella Sue.
Maybe you can tell me.

480
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,360
My worthy brothers.

481
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,160
Outlaws. Men with guns. Killers.

482
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,560
We didn't kill anybody.

483
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,680
One of the trainmen was shot dead.
What do you call that?

484
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,360
A Canfield didn't shoot him.

485
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,760
What difference does it make?
You were in on it.

486
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,840
Where's Tom?

487
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,000
In there. The bedroom.

488
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,320
He's been shot.

489
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,040
Hello, Tom.

490
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,040
You're kind of off the track,
aren't you, coming out here?

491
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,720
- How do you feel?
- I'll be good as ever in a day or two.

492
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,560
You bet.

493
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,560
My mistake was...

494
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,840
Well, we were wrong
to do it, Britt. Crazy.

495
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,280
Canfields are all crazy.

496
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,400
You too, taking the chance
on coming out here.

497
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,800
Don't talk. I'll get a doctor.

498
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,760
What for? To ask questions?
I tell you, I'm all right.

499
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,360
Whether you like it or not,
I'm getting a doctor.

500
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,760
{y:i}We...

501
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,080
We're still brothers, aren't we, Britt?

502
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,240
Sure. Always will be.

503
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,480
Good old Britt.

504
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,600
Always around when you need him.

505
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,520
Britt, someone's coming.

506
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,440
Some men.

507
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
I'll be right back.

508
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,520
Stay with him.

509
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,400
Put away your gun.

510
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,000
Clear the table.

511
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,280
Come in.

512
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,920
{y:i}Well...

513
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,480
- Evening, marshal.
- Evening.

514
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,760
What are you doing here?
What can we do for you?

515
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,520
Just checking up on a train robbery,
if you don't mind.

516
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,520
Canfield was just telling us about it.

517
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,720
Come in, sit down.

518
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,720
- Britt, you know Bat Masterson.
- Yeah.

519
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,040
Only law for 40 miles
around Dodge City.

520
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,000
Yeah, Canfield and I have met.
I see you know these folks.

521
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,200
Johnson's an old friend of mine
from back home.

522
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,960
When I'm in town,
I usually try to drop in on him.

523
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,720
Take a look.

524
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,640
Well, what about it?

525
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,680
I ain't sure, but I think so.
It's hard for me to tell.

526
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,400
You said you could recognize him.

527
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,040
Yeah, but I gotta be sure.

528
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,040
Terry! Terry!

529
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,680
That's her. That's the girl, all right.

530
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,600
I knew I'd know her
if I saw her again.

531
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,680
And that's the fella
I always seen her with.

532
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,200
I'm sure now.

533
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,760
You're pretty young, son, to be riding
with outlaws and holding up trains.

534
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,600
I couldn't hold up a train, sir.

535
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,200
I haven't been away in two days.
They'll tell you.

536
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,880
He's lying. I saw his face when his
mask fell. He's one of them outlaws.

537
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,120
He's not. He's been here all the time.

538
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,640
That's right, marshal. I was with him.

539
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
Looks like you've made
a mistake, Masterson.

540
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,200
Mistake? Maybe. But that's something
that'll come out in the hearing.

541
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,680
You're under arrest, son.

542
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,120
No! No!

543
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,560
Britt... Britt, you can't help.

544
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,760
Tom's dead.

545
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,400
You look at me like I was
the reason he was killed.

546
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,360
I'll let you answer that
in your own mind.

547
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,400
The farther you get from the South...

548
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,080
...the shorter your memory becomes.

549
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,360
Because our father
had been in Congress...

550
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,480
...had come back to Virginia
when the war started...

551
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,640
...because he still owned
a plantation...

552
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,320
...they said that
according to the terms...

553
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,160
...written in Johnson's
Amnesty Proclamation...

554
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,680
...he wasn't entitled to a pardon
like everyone else.

555
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,000
Well, that was a lie.

556
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,520
You, Father and all of us knew it.

557
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,160
They said... They said he hadn't
taken an oath of allegiance.

558
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,960
They said it was too late.

559
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,520
They used their crooked Yankee laws
for their own gain...

560
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,560
...to sell everything
the Canfields had.

561
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,520
You saw what it did to Father.

562
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,200
His heart couldn't stand that.

563
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,680
You stood there along with all of us.

564
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,880
Watched him die.

565
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,040
There wasn't anything
you could do about it.

566
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,840
Nothing any of us could do.

567
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,120
They killed him.

568
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,680
If what they did was no crime...

569
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,400
...then what we did today
was no crime either.

570
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,960
Maybe you can forget all that,
but I can't.

571
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,400
Mrs. Chandler. Mrs. Chandler.

572
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,440
What is it, Henry?

573
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,240
Another one of those coded messages
from the Denver Rio Grande Railroad.

574
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,760
Caught it going through.
Just deciphered it.

575
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,920
Looks important.

576
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,080
It'll go a lot easier with you,
Johnson, if you speak up.

577
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,160
Now, who rode with you
on that train robbery?

578
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,080
Nobody. I wasn't even there.

579
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,400
But we've got positive identification.

580
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,240
Britt, I have to see you.

581
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,400
Yeah, all right.

582
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,120
You know Dave's gone to Kansas City
to try to get the Wells, Fargo contract...

583
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,320
...which we need so badly,
and now this happened.

584
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,480
This wire was just sent from
the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad...

585
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,080
...ordering materials for them to start
building in Raton Pass right away.

586
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,440
But they've been building
through Royal Gorge.

587
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,520
Maybe they think they
can get both routes...

588
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,720
...block us this side of the mountains.
You've got to beat them to Raton, Britt.

589
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,240
We've lost the gorge.
The court ruled against us.

590
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,360
But if you should begin
grading first...

591
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,880
...Raton Pass will be ours
by prior construction.

592
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,680
Johnson, considering all the facts...

593
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,480
...as far as I'm concerned,
you're as guilty as sin.

594
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,120
Britt, a railroad must keep growing,
or it dies.

595
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,960
And if it dies, all life along
its right of ways dies too.

596
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,160
Our loyalty belongs
to the thousands of people...

597
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,800
...who've put their trust in men
like you and Baxter.

598
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,000
Nothing must stop this railroad
from going forward.

599
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,600
It's bigger than
any one person, Britt.

600
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,880
Even a brother.

601
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,760
Moose.

602
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,000
I've got a big job for you. Round up the
best gunmen and go to Royal Gorge.

603
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,200
Crack shots shouldn't be
hard to find here.

604
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,760
- What?
- We'll pay them enough.

605
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,200
Make up a special train.
I want you there by dawn.

606
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,840
Hold the Rio Grande people there.

607
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,400
I got eyes, and I never forget a face.

608
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,040
Oh, marshal, just a minute.

609
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,200
Rusty, you and the boys
did some celebrating...

610
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,160
...the night before the holdup and...

611
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,840
Well, with the new depot
opening and all...

612
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,280
...guess we took aboard a few.

613
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,040
From that headache you were carrying
around, I'd say it was a full shipment.

614
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,360
Now, a thing like that
could affect your eyesight.

615
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,320
There's nothing wrong
with my eyesight, then or now.

616
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,680
Rusty, see that man
standing back there?

617
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,840
- What about him?
- Take a good look at him.

618
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,280
- Now look this way. Describe him.
- What?

619
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,320
What does he look like?
What's he wearing?

620
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,760
Well, he's... He's got a hat on.

621
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,880
A kind of a brown one.

622
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,920
And a coat. A black one.

623
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,800
Very good.

624
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,160
Now, what about his eyes,
his mustache?

625
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,880
- His eyes are...
- No, no.

626
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,920
I don't remember.

627
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,760
But his mustache
is kind of pointed.

628
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,280
Look again, Rusty.

629
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,120
His hat is gray.
His coat isn't black, it's brown.

630
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,160
And he must've had a quick shave,
because I don't see any mustache.

631
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,760
I saw some specs advertised
in the last copy of Harper's Weekly.

632
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,560
I'll order you a pair.

633
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,800
Still stick with your witness, marshal?
And this time he's sober.

634
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,640
Come here, you.

635
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,520
Well, Johnson, I guess we can't
make it stick this time.

636
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,360
Even the railroad's on your side.

637
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,680
All right, you can go.

638
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,600
Very clever, Britt. And I'm glad.

639
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,120
Southern loyalty, I suppose.

640
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,800
Don't be forgetting,
nobody's to be hurt.

641
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,640
Mr. Harned! Mr. Harned!

642
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,760
The Atchison, Topeka
& Santa Fe Railroad...

643
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,520
...is going through Royal Gorge!

644
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,440
So be pulling your crews
out of there.

645
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,160
The Santa Fe.

646
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,520
If it's a showdown you want,
this is the right place for it.

647
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,920
Just like I told you. He'll fight it out
here if it takes all summer.

648
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,760
Keep them hopping, boys.

649
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,080
This won't get you anywhere!

650
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,040
I saw you pepper that hat.
That's fancy shooting.

651
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,560
- We've had practice.
- You boys are fine.

652
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,880
I was thinking you were
against the Santa Fe.

653
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,560
You're wrong.

654
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,360
Well, now, don't be letting
those Rio Grandes get bored.

655
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,640
They're not even
going to let us sleep.

656
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,600
I've arranged for horses
along the way.

657
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,440
How much more will she take?

658
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,160
As much as that lazy fireman
can give her.

659
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,080
Too bad I can't highball you
clean to Raton.

660
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,080
Sure hope you get there in time.

661
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,640
I will, if Moose can hold
those Rio Grande builders...

662
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,600
...at Royal Gorge long enough.

663
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,840
- Tie down the safety valve.
- I already did.

664
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,360
What's going on here?

665
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,440
Santa Fe gunmen are trying
to drive us out of the gorge.

666
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,920
But that's impossible.

667
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,920
The federal court issued an injunction
ordering the Santa Fe...

668
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,000
...to give the gorge to the Rio Grande.
- What?

669
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,280
The office rushed me out
with this copy.

670
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,920
Those men must know that.

671
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,920
- I get it.
- Get what?

672
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:04,000
It was a trick to hold me here,
to keep us away from Raton Pass.

673
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,120
The Santa Fe couldn't be there yet.
You could still beat them.

674
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,600
Joe. Joe. Round up
those graders again. Quick.

675
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,960
We're going on to Raton.

676
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
- Where's Mr. Wootton?
- There on the end. Fiddler.

677
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,040
- Hold your horse. What you doing?
- Business. Important.

678
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,720
Ain't nothing as important as Uncle
Dick winning that fiddling contest.

679
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,040
I got $ 18 bet on him.

680
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,480
Eighteen dollars. And we've got
700 miles of railroad on him.

681
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,880
How long does this last?

682
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,760
Till two of them fiddlers wear out.

683
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,560
- Why, it might take all night.
- Sure.

684
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,280
Keep it up, Pete, you old buzzard.

685
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,200
Oh, so you're from the Santa Fe.

686
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,680
Well, I got two brothers
working on the Santa Fe.

687
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,040
And when they're out of jobs,
I gotta feed them.

688
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,400
- Then let me through.
- No, you don't, mister.

689
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,800
Not till the fiddling's over.

690
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,560
You're all right, Uncle Dick.

691
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,200
Mr. Wootton. Hey, Mr. Wootton.

692
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,400
My name's Canfield.
I'm from the Santa Fe Railroad.

693
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,440
Canfield? Santa Fe?
What do you...? What do you want?

694
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,080
A railroad starts through here tonight,
ours or Rio Grande.

695
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,920
Ours by prior construction...

696
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,480
...if we can make a deal now
to buy your toll road.

697
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,280
Yep, I've been running this toll road
for many years now.

698
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,240
Hacked the whole 27 miles out
with my own hands.

699
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,720
The Santa Fe will do right by you.
Give you $50,000.

700
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,480
Fifty thousand?
What do you think I am?

701
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,680
You...? You want more?

702
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,440
Do you know where I got the money
to build this road with?

703
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,440
Back in '52,
I drove a herd of sheep...

704
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,480
...8900 of them, up to California...

705
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,760
...and sold them out
to the starving miners.

706
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,000
All the way from Taos
to Sacramento in 107 days.

707
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,600
Got back in 38 days
with a sack full of gold.

708
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,680
And a big sack. Yes, sir.

709
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,280
Now you'll get another sack.

710
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,280
Oh, I guess my riding days are over.

711
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,720
But I'd like to finish it out in style.

712
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,480
Just give me a free pass to ride
on them there steam cars.

713
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,680
It's a bargain, Uncle Dick.
It's a bargain.

714
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,840
And the $50,000.

715
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,680
All right. Men, $ 10 to everyone
who can handle a spade tonight.

716
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,000
- Ten dollars?
- Yeah.

717
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,560
- Count me in.
- Me too.

718
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,840
I'll grab an Irish banjo
and pick up a 10 myself.

719
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,520
Come on!

720
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,800
Uncle Dick, from the start
of this roadbed...

721
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,680
...we head straight for Raton Mountain,
where we'll tunnel through.

722
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,040
Raise the gate.

723
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,320
All right, men, get busy.

724
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,040
Come on. Some on this side.

725
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,880
Is this as fast as this thing will go?

726
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,880
Yep. Them horses
don't run by steam.

727
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,280
Old Dick Wootton's toll house
is close by now.

728
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,760
There they are, digging up the road.

729
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,960
- Let's get them and run them off.
- Shut up. Stay where you are.

730
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,120
Keep back. Until I tell you.

731
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,520
Smart trick.

732
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,080
To outwit the Rio Grande.

733
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,240
I have more men here than you have.
We could drive you off this mountain.

734
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,600
Go ahead and try it.

735
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,240
No. I don't want any bloodshed.

736
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,080
Neither do you.

737
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,160
We're both railroad builders.

738
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,360
It only matters to us,
not the people out there...

739
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,720
...whose railroad they use
as long as they have one.

740
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,360
That's the important thing.

741
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,400
So since you got here first,
let it be the Santa Fe.

742
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,920
Good luck.

743
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,760
Sure, you did a fine job, me boys.

744
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,760
But don't be strolling away too far.

745
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,440
The train for Dodge City will be
leaving in a few minutes.

746
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:46,840
When do we get our pay?

747
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,080
Don't you be worrying about that.
You'll get it.

748
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,400
- Yeah, you'll get it.
- Yeah, I hope we do.

749
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,160
Clint, there's Britt.

750
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,800
But if it weren't for him, l...

751
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,280
I know, I know, Terry,
but don't say anything.

752
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,600
You know how embarrassed
he gets when you thank him.

753
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,080
- Hi, Britt.
- What are you two doing out here?

754
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,120
- Were you at Royal Gorge?
- Sure.

755
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,520
When we heard you needed some
extra hands back in Dodge, we joined.

756
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,840
Why don't you sign up
for a steady job with us.

757
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,440
No, no. We'll be going back.

758
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,920
Fighting is one thing...

759
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,800
...but working regular hours is
something I wasn't cut out for.

760
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,440
This way, I'm my own boss
and not some Yankee.

761
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,480
And I thought you were
getting over that.

762
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,640
Hello, Britt.

763
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,520
Your chest must be puffed out
a foot after what you've done.

764
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,840
Naturally I feel good...

765
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,880
...but you made the winning
of Raton possible.

766
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,680
- I?
- By letting me go.

767
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,720
You know about us Canfields,
don't you?

768
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,880
Yes.

769
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,920
Will you believe me if I tell you
it was in self-defense?

770
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,120
Hotheaded southerners
and drunken northerners?

771
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,280
And we couldn't have proved
it wasn't murder?

772
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,680
Can you believe that?

773
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,040
I must have already, don't you think?

774
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,200
Yes, you... You must have, Judith.

775
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,040
But I'm glad you told me yourself.

776
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,120
For me, I'm getting sick of
this no-pay-on-payday business.

777
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,280
I've been out of money
for two weeks.

778
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,400
The road always comes through,
sooner or later.

779
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,800
Well, they can't pay
if they haven't got it.

780
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,080
They got it.

781
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,720
Santa Fe wouldn't be
the first railroad to go busted.

782
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,240
I read in the paper
about one of them eastern roads.

783
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,760
Yeah, there are rusty rails
and rotting ties...

784
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,400
...all over the United States
to prove that.

785
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,000
It's none of my business...

786
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,480
...but if I had pay coming,
I'd ask them about it.

787
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,680
I'd find out just when that pay train
was going to get here.

788
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,240
Fella's right.

789
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,080
Let's go find out about it right now.

790
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,120
All right, let's go. Come on.

791
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,080
What's the guy's name?

792
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,280
- Oh, Mr. Baxter!
- Hey, Mr. Baxter!

793
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,600
- What's the matter?
- We want our money.

794
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,440
- Yeah, how about our money.
- It'll be here before long.

795
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,960
Promises won't buy anything.
What we want is the cash.

796
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,360
- That's right.
- That's right.

797
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,440
Has Dave Baxter ever lied to you?

798
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,520
He says you'll get your money soon.
I say so too.

799
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,280
And I ought to know,
because I'm the one who'll pay you.

800
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,760
That still don't tell us
when the money's coming.

801
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,240
- Yeah. Where is the money?
- When's it coming?

802
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,520
I'll tell you when the money's
gonna get here, if it'll satisfy you.

803
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,680
There's a pay shipment leaving
Dodge City at midnight tonight.

804
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,280
It'll be here in the morning.

805
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,840
That's different.
That's all we're asking.

806
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,640
See how easy it is to find out
what you wanna know?

807
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,160
Board! All aboard for Dodge City!

808
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,400
Get this over to the telegraph office
right away.

809
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,320
Dave.

810
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,640
I wonder, Dave, was it wise
telling those men...

811
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,720
...when the pay train
was leaving Dodge?

812
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,320
- What do you mean?
- Suppose there's another holdup?

813
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,320
We'd lose the New Mexico extension.
The Wells, Fargo contract too.

814
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,360
- I hope there is a holdup.
- What?

815
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,840
There'll be no money aboard,
only 20 of Bat Masterson's deputies.

816
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,240
I just sent him a wire.

817
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,760
- A trap?
- Yes, a trap.

818
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,040
And if my way of thinking is correct,
it'll work.

819
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:09,000
You hope someone who heard you
out there will take the bait?

820
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,160
Very possible.

821
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:34,640
Catching these men makes a great
deal of difference, doesn't it?

822
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,040
The difference between
success and failure.

823
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:41,840
If we want the Wells, Fargo contract,
we've got to get rid of these outlaws.

824
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:01,080
He's made a fool of me,
and you helped him do it.

825
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,600
- Dave, you can't believe that.
- What else can I believe?

826
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,800
- Britt's done nothing wrong.
- They're brothers.

827
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,240
They've been in trouble before.
They killed a man.

828
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,640
Maybe they had to.
Maybe it was the soldier's fault.

829
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,760
They're southerners.
I know what hatred can do.

830
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,600
Some people get over it,
others don't.

831
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,560
You're condoning these men.

832
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,880
I was as revengeful against the South
because of what they took from me...

833
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,240
...as they must be against the North
because of what we took from them.

834
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,760
You've got a short memory.

835
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,600
Now you're talking the same kind
of hatred I had to fight.

836
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,800
It wasn't a hard fight with him
to help you, was it? A murderer.

837
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,080
I tell you the man
who was killed was drunk.

838
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,320
They had to shoot him
in self-defense.

839
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,440
- How do you know?
- Because Britt told me.

840
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,880
It's gone that far
between you, has it?

841
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,760
You're in love with him, aren't you?
Aren't you?

842
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,880
That's all the answer I need.

843
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,760
Twelve hours a day ain't enough
for a man to work.

844
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,640
Just a little run
down the line, he says.

845
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,480
Doggone if we ain't halfway
to Dodge City.

846
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,880
Well, just keep on going,
because that's where we're headed.

847
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,600
- What?
- You heard me.

848
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,840
Come in.

849
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,680
Well. You kind of like
surprise visits, don't you?

850
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,840
This will be the last one.

851
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,880
- Who else is here?
- No one.

852
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,880
So you came out to Colorado
to help the Santa Fe.

853
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,160
Finding out about a payroll
leaving tonight...

854
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,200
...was just an accident, I suppose.

855
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,680
Listen, Britt...

856
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,960
...we got a chance to square accounts
with those Yankees once and for all.

857
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,880
- Don't try to stop us.
- You bet I won't.

858
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,160
Ride for that train,
and you ride to your death.

859
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,720
Bat Masterson's men
will be aboard waiting for you.

860
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,400
But there won't be any money.

861
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,320
I don't believe it. It's a trick.

862
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,480
On Baxter's part.

863
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,080
I might lie for my brothers,
but I never lie to them.

864
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,880
Then I guess we'll have to
call off the whole thing.

865
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,360
Canfields are finished around here.

866
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,000
Pack out tonight,
and I'll go with you to Virginia.

867
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,760
You'll go with us?

868
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,240
- What about your ever-loving railroad?
- That's finished too, for me.

869
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,600
There's someone who believes in me,
in all the Canfields...

870
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,760
...and we are not
going to destroy that trust.

871
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,760
Yeah.

872
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,400
Come on, let's all go back home.

873
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,920
Yes. Yes, we'll go.

874
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,080
It's what I've always wanted, Clint.

875
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,800
Sure. We'll go.

876
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,920
Then be ready to leave in an hour.

877
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,640
There's something in town I must do.

878
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,880
Well, what's so funny?
We aren't gonna get the payroll.

879
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,520
Aren't we?

880
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,000
If the money isn't onboard that train,
there's only one place it can be.

881
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,960
In the railroad safe
at the Dodge City depot.

882
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,560
And with those marshals out of town,
riding that train, waiting for us...

883
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,440
...what could be nicer?

884
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,520
- But, Clint, we promised.
- I know.

885
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,800
Isn't it a lucky thing I was listening?

886
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,160
So Mr. Britt Canfield is your brother.

887
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,560
Wouldn't the railroad
like to know that.

888
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,560
Come on, before Crake
and the boys get tired waiting.

889
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,160
Will you see that this gets
to Dave Baxter in La Junta?

890
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,160
Wells, Fargo!

891
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,320
There's more than a payroll here.
There's a couple of hundred thousand.

892
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,320
Come on.

893
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:53,760
Outlaws robbed the depot safe
and shot a couple of guards.

894
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,080
Ella Sue, where are they?

895
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,240
I don't know.

896
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,000
You know they robbed the depot.

897
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,880
- Yes.
- Then you know where to find them.

898
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,400
- No.
- They've got to be brought in.

899
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,440
People were killed tonight.

900
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,600
I can't find Terry and Clint,
that'll mean more killing.

901
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,240
Innocent men. Doesn't that
mean anything to you?

902
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,800
Yes. Yes, it does.

903
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,080
They ridden to the way station
at Lyles Crossing.

904
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:57,640
They're going to stop
the westbound and escape.

905
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,760
Sanders planned it.

906
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,600
I was supposed to meet them there...

907
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,480
...go with them.

908
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,960
But it would always be
running away...

909
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:16,520
...somebody after you
all your life, hiding, afraid.

910
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,160
Anything's better than that.

911
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,280
I'd rather see Terry in prison.

912
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:27,920
Clint did this to us. I hate him.

913
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,640
No, Ella Sue. Don't hate Clint.

914
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,040
I'm the one to blame. I'm the oldest.

915
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,600
They always did what I said.

916
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,160
I should have
kept the family together.

917
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,760
Britt.

918
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:47,400
Save Terry for me, if you can.

919
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,400
I thought I'd find you here.
Where's the rest of your gang?

920
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:57,480
I realize all the Santa Fe meant to you
was a chance to get some fast money.

921
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,840
Take it easy, Baxter.
Where are your brothers?

922
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,080
- I can't tell you that.
- We'll catch them.

923
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,120
- Meanwhile, you're under arrest.
- You're making a mistake.

924
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:06,840
Britt had nothing to do with it.

925
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,400
He came to find them,
to make them give themselves up.

926
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,400
Is that true? Then you won't mind
telling us where they are.

927
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,840
You ever had
any brothers, Masterson?

928
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,400
- You leave me no choice.
- They're at Lyles Crossing.

929
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,200
- Ella Sue.
- Lf you hurry, you can get there.

930
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,640
I love Terry,
and I don't wanna love a killer.

931
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,840
Let's move.
Carter, stay here with Canfield.

932
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,000
- I've got to go with you.
- So you can tell them we're coming?

933
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,320
- Keep him here.
- I'm trying to save your lives.

934
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,600
- And theirs?
- Lf I can. They'll shoot it out.

935
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,120
- That's the way we'd like it.
- And you'll win, but you won't all win.

936
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,200
I wanna stop them
as much as you do.

937
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,720
If I can make them give up
without a fight, I will.

938
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,680
Swear him in as a deputy, Bat.

939
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,240
Captain Canfield's a good man
in a fight. I ought to know.

940
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,520
We're cattlemen, mister.
Want tickets for Fort Lyon.

941
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,840
How many traveling?

942
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,640
- Six.
- Seven.

943
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,720
There's a young woman
supposed to meet us.

944
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,480
I ain't seen nothing all day,
except you men...

945
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,960
...and what trains go whizzing by.

946
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,920
They don't stop unless I flag them.

947
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,440
How long till ours leaves?

948
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,440
Well, that's a touchy question.

949
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,960
Sometimes she's 10 minutes late,
sometimes two hours.

950
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:55,680
Last week, she was on time once.

951
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:08,440
I guess she'll be on time...

952
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,160
On time tonight too.

953
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,640
They're just telegraphing about it.

954
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:18,960
I guess I'd better tell them
that I've got passengers.

955
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,360
Forget about the tickets.

956
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,080
We'll use our passes.

957
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,960
Looks like they're here.

958
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:50,280
Just be ready to flag down that train,
and nothing will happen to you.

959
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,080
Ella Sue ought to be here by now.

960
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,720
I hope she don't get here.
A woman is only in the way.

961
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,200
I'm not going without her.

962
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,920
You can't rush them
without somebody getting hurt.

963
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,520
Yeah.

964
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,240
You inside there...

965
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,760
...come out with your hands up.
You can't get away...

966
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:46,240
- I'm going to talk to them.
- No, wait, Canfield. Don't risk it.

967
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,880
They're my brothers. I'll be fine.

968
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,240
They're desperate men
fighting for their lives.

969
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,280
They're still my brothers.

970
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,320
Clint, Terry, can you hear?

971
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:11,200
Clint, Terry, can't you hear me?

972
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,840
Yeah. Get away from here, Britt.
Go back.

973
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,560
There are too many of us.
Give up while you can.

974
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,800
You'll get a fair trial.

975
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,480
Fair trial?

976
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,160
If you want us, come and get us.

977
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,800
- Don't!
- Get away.

978
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:34,560
Could've figured you'd turn yellow
when it'd come to him.

979
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,440
Keep away from
that window, Sanders.

980
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,800
It's your own fault, Terry.
You shouldn't have done it.

981
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,240
Britt!

982
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,080
Britt!

983
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,760
We'll board the train on the fly.

984
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,920
As soon as the engine gets between us
and the marshals, make a run for it.

985
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,640
You're not getting on any train.

986
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,800
So you Canfields are all alike.

987
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:25,320
Come on.

988
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,400
Keep rolling.

989
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,560
Keep your hands off that brake.

990
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,440
Come down.

991
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,560
Stop this train.

992
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,200
Stop this train.

993
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,360
Honor your partner,
lady by your side.

994
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,400
Circle left for quite a while.

995
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,040
Circle right for half a mile.

996
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,000
Swing your honey
and give her a smile.

997
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,440
Allemande left with your left hand.

998
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,920
Back to the right.
To the right, left grand.

999
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,920
Meet your honey
and promenade home.

1000
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:04,920
I wish to pay tributes to the men
who built this railroad.

1001
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,240
Let us drink a toast
to Cyrus K. Holliday...

1002
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:12,440
...and his chief construction engineer,
Mr. Dave Baxter.

1003
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:17,080
Well, Colonel Holliday and I
are not the men who built the railroad.

1004
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:20,880
As for myself,
I'm only one of the men.

1005
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:25,440
But there is a man to whom
we owe a great deal personally.

1006
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,040
He isn't here.

1007
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,600
I wish he were. I'd like to thank him
and to shake his hand.

1008
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:37,000
He put the welfare of this road
above all else, even above self.

1009
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,960
Why, gentlemen, look at you.
What happened?

1010
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,960
We've come to say goodbye,
that's what.

1011
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,960
We're quitting as soon as we get
this kettle to headquarters.

1012
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,960
But where can you get another job?

1013
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,440
Oh, we got one already.

1014
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,160
I wonder if you'd write down
a telegram for us.

1015
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,280
It's to tell them
that we're on the way.

1016
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,800
Certainly.

1017
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,880
Just say, Leaving Saturday.

1018
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,440
Who is it going to?

1019
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:04,840
Oh, construction engineer on the new
railroad they're building up in Nevada.

1020
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,160
Name's Canfield.

1021
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,240
Britt Canfield.

1022
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:15,240
Never mind the telegram, boys.
I'll deliver it myself.

1023
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,400
Hey, where did you say
that is in Nevada?

1024
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,000
Where is it?

1025
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,520
What the future holds,
no man can know...

1026
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:32,560
...but there'll always be
a new end of track.

1027
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,560
Our trains will become
bigger and faster.

1028
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,840
For as the railroads grow...

1029
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,600
...so will America.
