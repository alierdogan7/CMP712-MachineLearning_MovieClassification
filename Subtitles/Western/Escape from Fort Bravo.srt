Why does it have to be
such a big secret?

-Because l'm not supposed to have brains?
-That's a good question.

Halfway home.

-How long were they here?
-They haven't got a chance, Roper.

697
00:59:03,756 --> 00:59:07,522
When we got here, they told us
the whole country's alive with Mescaleros.

-About half of them.

He's the kind who'll follow a man
right around the Earth.
