00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,596
[Cady] [echoing] Dad! Dad!

4
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:56,431
Dad, Dad, Dad.

5
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,432
Stop, stop!

6
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,226
- Aah!
- Dad, Dad, it's me.

7
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,269
It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me.

8
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,187
I'm on your side.

9
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:03,479
I'm on your side.

10
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:05,649
Dad, Dad, it's me.

11
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,150
[Walt] Cady.

12
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,068
Oh, my God.

13
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,528
Oh, my God, what happened?

14
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,737
Where is she?

15
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,739
- Oh, my God.
- Where is she, Cady?

16
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,408
I got to stop the bleeding, okay?

17
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,744
Shh, shh, don't speak.
Just stay right there.

18
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:17,870
Don't move, don't move.

19
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:25,961
I'm right here.

20
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,128
[Walt] Where is she?

21
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:28,797
Where is she, Cady?

22
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,643
Dad, I'm right here.
I'm right here, okay?

23
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,176
[Walt] Cady, I... Cady.

24
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,511
- Cady.
- Stay with me.

25
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,807
- Cady.
- Yeah.

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,516
- Yeah.
- Where is she?

27
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:41,935
Where is she?

28
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:43,937
She's dead, Dad.

29
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:45,939
Mom's dead.

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,523
She's gone.

31
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:49,693
But I'm right here.

32
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:50,903
- Cady.
- I'm right here.

33
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,167
I'm right here,
and you're gonna be fine.

34
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,657
Okay? Stay here.

35
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,659
Stay with me.

36
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,081
Dad.

37
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,750
Dad.

38
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,084
Dad!

39
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,212
[echoing] Dad! Please wake up!

40
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,339
Please, Dad!

41
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,591
Please wake up! Don't leave me!

42
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,511
Please don't leave me, Dad!

43
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,849
Please don't leave me, too.

Sit down, Standing Bear.

46
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,504
I would rather stand.

47
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,716
Yeah, I would, too,
if I had a bullet in my ass.

48
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,304
.30-caliber bullet
from Walt Longmire's rifle.

49
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,890
He fired at the man he
thought was Hector.

50
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,728
Bullet hit this rock and ricocheted
into your butt as you ran away.

51
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,274
You dripped blood under these leaves.

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,485
Same blood I found soaking
the seat of your truck.

53
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,695
Which was stolen.

54
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,448
No, it just wasn't
where you had stashed it

55
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,701
after it broke down,
'cause I found it.

56
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,912
I fixed your punctured fuel line,
by the way.

57
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,621
If you were so certain
you had me dead to rights,

58
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,250
why am I not in jail?

59
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,085
Oh, jail's still on the table...

60
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,130
for the assault and
murder of Tyler Malone.

61
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,216
But I'm gonna give you another choice.

62
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:37,926
You can work for me.

63
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,388
Well, not so much you as Hector.

64
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,014
Doing what?

65
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,725
Whatever I ask.

66
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,227
[cellphone ringing]

67
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,354
Don't answer.

68
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,068
She will wonder why I am not picking up.

69
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,528
And you'll lie to her.

70
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,405
You've gotten pretty good at that.

71
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,994
I believe you are overplaying your hand.

72
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,662
Is that so?

73
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,123
Even if I did what you say,

74
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,208
you have no authority
to prosecute felonies,

75
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,586
and the feds have never been
interested in helping you.

76
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:13,879
True.

77
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,382
But I'm gonna have
something this time...

78
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,760
I've never had before.

79
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:21,719
Evidence.

80
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,849
Now let's roll up that sleeve, hmm?

81
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,700
[panting]

82
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,121
Where is he?

83
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,832
Lady, I don't know
what you're talking about.

84
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,846
[monitor beeping]

85
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,443
[sighs]

86
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,480
I just had to do that
once before you die.

87
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,901
I'm not dying.

88
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:04,990
I know.

89
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:07,952
[footsteps approaching]

90
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,202
[clears throat]

91
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,329
- Hey.
- Oh.

92
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,123
Thank God.
You're awake.

93
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,585
He's, uh... a little stunned
from the surgery still.

94
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,005
Hey.

95
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,256
You feeling okay?

96
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,300
Yeah.

97
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,303
Okay enough to answer some questions?

98
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,184
Uh-huh.

99
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,186
What the hell happened?

100
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,731
I got, uh...

101
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,567
And if you say you got shot,
I am gonna punch you.

102
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,535
Beyond that, I... don't know.

103
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,332
The bullet went through
and through, Dad.

104
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,656
But it only hit soft tissue,
so there's minimal damage.

105
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,670
They say you took a pretty
hard blow to the head.

106
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:02,922
Five stitches.

107
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,550
[Vic]
Who was it, Walt?

108
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,516
I don't know.

109
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,852
Did you not hear them come in?
Were you... were you asleep?

110
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,149
Um...

111
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,276
No.

112
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,318
What were you doing?

113
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,407
I was... I was with someone.

114
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,536
Donna was there?

115
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,081
Who's... who's Donna?

116
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,959
[Walt] D-Donna's, um...

117
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,460
She's his girlfriend.

118
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,590
[clears throat]

119
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,015
Is she here, too?

120
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,641
No, I don't think so.

121
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,560
You haven't found Donna?

122
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,896
Walt, we didn't know we were supposed
to be looking for her, okay?

123
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,441
How long have I been here?

124
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,069
13 hours.

125
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,113
Then he's still here.

126
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,032
- Who's still here?
- Walker Browning.

127
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,201
You're gonna lay down. Dad, Dad.

128
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,703
Stop it.

129
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,330
- Stop it.
- Shit.

130
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,789
- Come on.
- Nurse!

131
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,166
Walt! Hey.

132
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,333
Help, Nurse!

133
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,709
Dad.

134
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,710
Sit down.

135
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,046
- Dad.
- Come on.

136
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,880
Dad, where are you going?

137
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,090
Room 119.

138
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,342
- Dad, stop it.
- Yeah, Ferg.

139
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,843
Dr. Donna Monaghan.

140
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,847
Yes, the psychiatrist.
You need to find her.

141
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,233
Walt, why do you think
that Walker is here?

142
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,386
I handcuffed him to the bed.

143
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,188
Walker.

144
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,110
Uh, no. My name's Ruth.

145
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,406
He was right here.

146
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,325
Room 119.

147
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,784
Would you like to sit down?

148
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,661
You don't look well.

149
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,620
Sorry.

150
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,791
Where's Walker Browning?
He's supposed to be in that room.

151
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,709
He was released yesterday afternoon.

152
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,545
- Who released him?
- The sheriff.

153
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,214
This is the sheriff.

154
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,716
This is Sheriff Wilkins?

155
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,219
[Cady] Dad, stop. You can barely walk.

156
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,930
As long as I can do that,
I have to find her.

157
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,153
If Walker was released
yesterday afternoon,

158
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,628
would that have given him
enough time to get to your cabin?

159
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:25,070
Sure.

160
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,026
[grunts]

161
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,240
Come on.

162
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:35,658
[grunts]

163
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,452
So, what time were you attacked?

164
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,120
I wasn't wearing a watch.

165
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,664
[exhales deeply]

166
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,790
No, I know, I'm just...

167
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,269
I'm just trying to make sense
of the timeline is all, you know?

168
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,172
Walker had a lot to do in...

169
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,299
not a lot of time.

170
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,177
Damn it.

171
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,263
[grunts]

172
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,853
[grunting]

173
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,313
Okay, this is ridiculous.

174
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,503
- No, I got it.
- No, you don't. Here.

175
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:09,859
- I got it, Vic.
- It's fine.

176
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,944
Here, hold on. Just give me your foot.

177
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,281
Give me your foot.

178
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,573
Okay.

179
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,700
Okay.
All right.

180
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,993
Here.

181
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:19,994
Thanks.

182
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,332
Maybe you should stop
flattering yourself.

183
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,334
Maybe this isn't all
about you, you know?

184
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,046
What? Me getting shot in my house?

185
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,464
Yeah.

186
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,424
And Dr. Monaghan disappearing.

187
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,097
Maybe this is all about her,
and you're the collateral damage.

188
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,599
Think about it, Walt.

189
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,404
One of her patients attempts suicide
and then sets her van on fire?

190
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,441
Stopped at the hospital.
Why aren't you there?

191
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,235
Because he refuses to listen
to anyone who cares about him.

192
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,279
Any sign of Donna, Ferg?

193
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,573
Uh, no answer on her home phone.

194
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,451
She wasn't scheduled to work today.

195
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,619
I asked the Sheridan P.D.
to stop by her house.

196
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,037
My boots.

197
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,331
[grunts]

198
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,083
Um...

199
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,752
Also, Doc Weston told
me to give you these.

200
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,097
[straining] Put out an APB on Donna.

201
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:26,143
Have Ruby call every
hospital in the state.

202
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,396
[exhales deeply]

203
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:34,902
[breathing heavily]

204
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,946
I don't think I can be any more clear.

205
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,534
Is there a reason you're
not doing what I asked?

206
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,578
Actually, yeah.

207
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,913
I think somebody should
be looking for Zach.

208
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,457
When was the last time you saw him?

209
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,874
When I fired him.

210
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,002
Why?

211
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,879
Well, the last time I saw him,

212
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,424
he'd started drinking again
and he was in a pretty dark place.

213
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:00,970
Oh, come on. You think that Zach shot
Walt and kidnapped Dr. Monaghan?

214
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,013
My belt.

215
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,682
What do you think, Walt?

216
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,982
Well... I don't know.

217
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,738
I don't remember the actual...
actual event.

218
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,422
- Well, then you don't know...
- I don't!

219
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,241
Okay?!

220
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,659
I don't remember!

221
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,123
I don't know if it was...
it was Walker Browning or...

222
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,919
one of Donna's patients,
or the guy I just fired.

223
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,463
I don't know.

224
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,522
Then let's go see if we can't
clear some things up, okay?

225
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,773
- Yep.
- Okay.

226
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,281
[door opens]

227
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,684
Did you hear him break in?

228
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,269
Maybe.

229
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,275
So, they kicked through the front door.

230
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,653
You got shot there?

231
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,327
Or is that where Cady found you?

232
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,413
Uh...

233
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,420
I guess, uh, the shooter
must've hit me in my room

234
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,338
and I crawled out here.

235
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,802
You got shot through the door?

236
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,429
I guess so.

237
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,849
So it's not that you can't
remember who shot you.

238
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,018
You didn't even see him?

239
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,772
[high-pitched ringing]

240
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,734
This must be where you
were when you got hit.

241
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,402
I'll see if I can find the slugs.

242
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,086
[sighs]

243
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,256
Found one.

244
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,342
Hey, Ferg, you got an evidence bag?

245
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,511
Yeah.

246
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,479
What'd you find?

247
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,609
Evidence.

248
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,618
All right.

249
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,079
I'm gonna go see what
kind of slugs these are.

250
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,204
.30 caliber.

251
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,583
My rifle's gone.

252
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,629
I was shot with my own rifle.

253
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,130
[sighs]

254
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:29,345
Bet that's what he used to smash me
in the back of the head, too, so...

255
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,305
[Ferg] Walt.

256
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,934
We got two bullet holes, we got two
slugs, and we got one blood spot,

257
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,853
so at least we know that Dr.
Monaghan didn't get shot.

258
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,814
[Vic] Hey, Walt.

259
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,651
I know you said that you didn't hear
a car approach your cabin,

260
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,094
but isn't it possible that one
did and you didn't hear him

261
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:46,537
because...

262
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,657
I don't want to get too personal, but...

263
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:53,995
Walker didn't drive here.

264
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,830
We don't know it was Walker.

265
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,499
- He drove away.
- In a getaway car?

266
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,628
Sort of.

267
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,712
He took my Bronco.

268
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,014
So, he shoots you... but not Donna.

269
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,646
And he drives off in your
truck with her in tow.

270
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,295
This is really starting to seem
like she was the target, Walt.

271
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,365
Who else knew that she was out here?

272
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,163
Just you and me.

273
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,342
That's why I don't think
this is about her.

274
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,878
Somebody tried to hurt me.

275
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,761
[sighs]

276
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,100
[door slams]

277
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,366
So, what now?

278
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,412
Check and see if anybody's
responded to the APB.

279
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,458
And try and track the Bronco,
figure out which way they went.

280
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,044
And I have to make a little trip.

281
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,845
[indistinct shouting]

282
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,309
[Man] Come on, hustle!

283
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,727
All right!

284
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,131
[Man #2] Come on, now! Let's go!

285
00:17:43,155 --> 00:17:44,479
[Man] Batter up!

286
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,482
- You see him?
- He's right there.

287
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,524
[Walt] Hey, Jim.

288
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:53,197
You know, Walt, sometimes I wonder
who's looking after your county

289
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,990
when you're over here in mine.

290
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,910
Where's Walker Browning? I know you
released him from the hospital.

291
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,955
This is not really a
good time right now.

292
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,358
I'm gonna sing the national
anthem here in just a minute.

293
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,751
- You let a criminal go.
- Did I?

294
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,836
What crime did he commit, anyways?

295
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,559
From what I understand, you guys
didn't charge him with anything.

296
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,673
- He was trying to murder Gab Langton.
- Well, that's not the story I heard.

297
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,885
And what story did you hear?

298
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,803
Well, the story I heard
is about a sheriff

299
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,806
with a bug up his ass
about an oil company

300
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:21,434
trying to pin a rape and murder case
on a couple decent oil workers.

301
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,185
When he couldn't make that stick,

302
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,429
then he stalks them into the
woods and ambushed them.

303
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,440
That's a lie. Walker and Trot
Simic were trying to kill Gab.

304
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,360
- They'd have killed me, too, if I...
- Yeah, if you hadn't shot first.

305
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,738
You really think I'd
lie about this, Jim?

306
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,946
I think you've been under a lot of
pressure these last couple months, Walt.

307
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,827
I think it's clouded your judgment.

308
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,203
He did this to me.

309
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,290
He shot me, and he abducted this woman.

310
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,250
Now I need to find her.

311
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:50,129
I know you got a blind spot where
the oil companies are concerned, Jim.

312
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,090
But I never thought you'd go this far.

313
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,591
God damn it, Walt.

314
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,970
Your self-righteous habit of
accusing people without any evidence

315
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,641
is gonna get you into a shitload
of trouble someday, and soon.

316
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,644
Like the next time you come into my
county without a proper warrant.

317
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,066
[gate closes]

318
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:22,244
[piano playing]

319
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,926
[playing continues]

320
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,057
[sighs]

321
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,688
When we get to the Newett oil field,
you keep the work site office occupied.

322
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,315
I'll take a look around for Walker.

323
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,528
Vic, where are you going?

324
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,404
Do you really think

325
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:01,034
that Walker Browning
is gonna escape captivity, shoot you,

326
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,285
and then head back to work?

327
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,330
- He's gone, Walt.
- So where are we going?

328
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,457
We're expanding our search
for Dr. Monaghan

329
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,003
to include people who actually had
something to do with Dr. Monaghan.

330
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,006
Jesus, Walt, we both saw that smoldering
van after one of her patients torched it.

331
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,985
The least we could do is try and
figure out who that patient is

332
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,136
and get an address for him.

333
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,016
- Fine.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

334
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,936
Did I give you the impression
that I was asking permission?

335
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,187
Because I wasn't.

336
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,606
[cellphone rings]

337
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,150
[cellphone beeps]

338
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,442
Yeah, Ferg?

339
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,944
I found Walt's Bronco.

340
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,696
I'm right here, Ferg.

341
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,032
<i>Where's my truck?</i>

342
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,743
It's about a quarter
mile from your cabin.

343
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:27,954
The keys are still in it.

344
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,496
What about my rifle?

345
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,166
No. No sign of it.

346
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,254
But it looks like there was
another car parked here.

347
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,423
I'm thinking the shooter stashed his car

348
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,467
<i>and snuck up to your place on foot.</i>

349
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,764
Hey, Ferg, is there any sign
that Donna was in the Bronco?

350
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,765
<i>Nothing obvious.</i>

351
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,978
I'll have it towed to the print shed
so I can take a more thorough look.

352
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,021
At least there isn't any blood.

353
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,232
<i>That's a good sign.</i>

354
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,368
[grunts]

355
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,330
We need to see Dr.
Monaghan's patient files.

356
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,417
You know we can't do that.
We've got HIPAA restrictions.

357
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,128
We understand that doctor-patient
privilege normally applies,

358
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,005
but Dr. Monaghan is missing.

359
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,259
- Have you heard from her?
- We weren't expecting her today.

360
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,625
We think that she was abducted
by one of her patients.

361
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:28,110
- This is important.
- And so is the privacy of our patients.

362
00:22:28,134 --> 00:22:30,021
Look, if you're telling the truth,

363
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,477
you won't have any trouble getting
a judge to write you a limited warrant.

364
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,354
- We don't have time for that.
- [chuckles]

365
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,941
You had time to drive all the
way over from another county.

366
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,068
And what does that mean?

367
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,944
If Donna really was missing,

368
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,738
I would expect to see
the Sheridan police.

369
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:48,367
Really? Okay. 'Cause she
disappeared in our county

370
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,704
two days after her car was firebombed
in our county, so, you know.

371
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,790
- Oh!
- Call an ambulance!

372
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,793
Walt!
Come on!

373
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,754
What are you... what
are you waiting for?!

374
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,465
- It's... it's dead.
- Well, then go find another one!

375
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,927
Walt? Walt?

376
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,387
Are you okay? Walt!

377
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,099
[door closes]
You are a genius.

378
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,558
[grunting]

379
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,230
Walt.

380
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,773
Hey.

381
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:20,732
Come on.

382
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,858
Give me a hand.

383
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,780
Walt, come on, man.
There's, like, tons of files.

384
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:30,825
Walt! You know, I could use
a little help over here.

385
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,369
Walt!

386
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,538
Walt?

387
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,415
Walt, wake up.

388
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,001
Walt, are you okay?

389
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,543
Are you okay?

390
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,840
You're not gonna kiss me again, are you?

391
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,258
[sighs]

392
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,220
The paramedics are on their way.

393
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,306
No, no. No, that's, uh...

394
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,808
- Okay.
- That's not necessary.

395
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,352
I'm, uh... I'm fine.

396
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,104
Really.

397
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,691
I'm fine.

398
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,068
Thank you.

399
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,699
We're gonna come back with
a warrant, ma'am, okay?

400
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,541
I'm taking you to the hospital.

401
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,672
I'm fine.

402
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,592
No, you're obviously not fine.
You passed out.

403
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,716
A few minutes ago,
you thought that was brilliant.

404
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,764
A few minutes ago,
I thought you were faking it.

405
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,391
I just need something to eat.

406
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,517
- Did you take the pills?
- They make me drowsy.

407
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,978
I can't go to sleep.
I have to find Donna.

408
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,064
- Walt.
- Just take me to the arson inve...

409
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,255
Happy?

410
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,798
Ecstatic.

411
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,516
Did you?

412
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,767
[tires screech]

413
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,977
Damn it, Walt!
Seriously?

414
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,190
You know, I know that this isn't
a normal missing person for you

415
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:28,652
and that you care about her
or love her or whatever.

416
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:34,783
And maybe I don't care about
her as much as you do,

417
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,494
but I care about you, okay?

418
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,006
And don't, okay?

419
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,675
I'm not jealous.

420
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,218
That kiss...

421
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,428
Vic.

422
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,096
It wasn't me making a move, okay?

423
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,058
It was me... moving on.

424
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,685
All right?

425
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,020
And if you really, really
want to help Donna,

426
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:05,865
you're gonna have to
take care of yourself,

427
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,108
and if that means being drowsy,
then so be it.

428
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,068
Okay?

429
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,653
Now open your mouth.

430
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,904
Vic.

431
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,573
Open your damn mouth.

432
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,161
Swallow.

433
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,506
Show me.

434
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,552
Tongue.

435
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,806
You are like a frickin' four-year-old.

436
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,727
Ow.

437
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,455
[knock on door]

438
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,872
It is open.

439
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,415
[door opens]

440
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,251
[Vic] Okay, watch your step.

441
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,383
Walt, what are you doing here?

442
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,551
- He said he called you.
- He lied.

443
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,845
I meant to call.

444
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,974
His house is a crime scene.
He can't sleep there.

445
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,143
You should be at the hospital.

446
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,561
I was.

447
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,980
Not when I stopped by.

448
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,776
He checked himself out
because he's invincible.

449
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,238
So, can he stay?

450
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,084
I got to get back to work and start
going over some patient files.

451
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,367
- Of course.
- I'm going with you, Vic.

452
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:42,786
Go. I will keep him restrained.

453
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,703
Thank you.

454
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,921
So, the last time you were here, I drew
you a map to the Crow Reservation.

455
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,385
Is that what got you shot?

456
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,803
I think so.

457
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,971
I ran into Walker Browning out there.

458
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,642
How did he know where to find Gab?

459
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,186
I don't know.

460
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,023
Did he get her? Is she okay?

461
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,692
She's fine.

462
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,279
She got away.

463
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,240
But...
[groans]

464
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,117
...Trot Simic is dead.

465
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,369
Shot.

466
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:25,912
Who shot him?

467
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,914
I don't know.

468
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,166
I thought I had him, Henry.

469
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,752
[moans]

470
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:32,919
Trot?

471
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,838
Uh, no.

472
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,007
Walker.

473
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,592
He got away, too.

474
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,555
And now he's got Donna.

475
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,097
Who is Donna?

476
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:50,313
She's a... psychiatrist.

477
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,984
[sighs]

478
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,656
Well...

479
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,573
[grunts]

480
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,952
...I have been busy, too.

481
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,082
I will tell you about it
some other time.

482
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,479
Hey, Ferg, what did you do
with the prescription records?

483
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:36,900
Uh, they're, um... right next
to the, uh, bipolar cases.

484
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,110
Okay.

485
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,280
[sighs]

486
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,199
Vic.

487
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:49,329
- Yeah?
- I found a blonde hair in Walt's Bronco.

488
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,506
Yeah, no, I mean, we sort of figured
that she was in the Bronco, so...

489
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,919
It was in the way back.

490
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,467
Shit.

491
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,473
Uh...

492
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,560
Could be mine.

493
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,228
I was back there with Tyler Malone.

494
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,105
Should I tell Walt about it?

495
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,191
No. No, don't.

496
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,778
Um... he doesn't need the extra stress.

497
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,448
Um...

498
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,828
Find a lab, run it against mine.

499
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,415
And if it's a match,

500
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:37,252
then there's no need to worry him, okay?

501
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,132
[door opens]

502
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,468
- [Walt] What do you got there, Ferg?
- What?

503
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,927
Nothing.

504
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,223
How did you sleep?

505
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,184
Lot better than you two, looks like.

506
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,727
- So, uh...
- Here.

507
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,269
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

508
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,649
Anybody got a line on Walker
Browning's whereabouts?

509
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,696
No. We've been going through Dr.
Monaghan's patient files and notebooks

510
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,780
trying to find that patient that she
mentioned after her van got torched.

511
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,740
We found a few suicide attempts

512
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,343
and a bunch more that Dr. Monaghan
seemed to be worried about.

513
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:13,038
We're focusing on patients
that live in Absaroka

514
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,915
since that's the hospital they went to.

515
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,376
Yeah, but, unfortunately,
we can't, uh, check them

516
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,879
against the date that you saw Donna
at the hospital visiting her patient.

517
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,005
Why not?

518
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,758
'Cause I didn't get them.

519
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,885
We're missing the last three weeks.

520
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,054
And they're the ones we need.

521
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:33,224
Sure, yeah, but we, um... we still have
a really good suspect list.

522
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:37,896
Um, Kyle McCormick, Duncan Butler,
Tamar Smith, Jesse Cruz.

523
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,689
I say we split up and go interview them.

524
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,483
[Walt sighs]

525
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,611
The arson investigation
turn anything up?

526
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,405
As of two hours ago, nothing.

527
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,407
[door opens]
Check again.

528
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,330
We got to make sure
we got our ducks in a row

529
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,536
before we start running
down Donna's patients.

530
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,871
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Punk.

531
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,459
Is that what all this is?
These are Donna's patient files?

532
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,795
Not all of them.
We're missing the last few weeks.

533
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,084
Please tell me you got these
from a Special Master.

534
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,550
What's that?

535
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:10,971
Uh, the guy that the judge
would normally appoint

536
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,140
to, uh, decide which
files we can look at.

537
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,101
Normally. Yeah.

538
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,436
So, not in this case.

539
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:22,273
Okay, I guess you'll just have to claim
that you're not in your right mind.

540
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,525
Yeah, he's not.

541
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,986
You know, under the circumstances,

542
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,572
I'll pay whatever fines they impose.

543
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,323
"Fines"?

544
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,659
Dad, you have a major
civil suit pending.

545
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,539
If they find out that you're
illegally seizing files...

546
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,874
Cady, they don't even
know that these are gone.

547
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,417
Good. Then you can give them back,

548
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,795
and you can get a judge
to appoint a Special Master.

549
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,047
Then what? Wait?

550
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,716
Donna's missing.

551
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,177
You know, once I found myself
in similar circumstances,

552
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,889
and someone once told me that I could get
the same information a different way.

553
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:54,931
A legal way.

554
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,725
Hey.

555
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,849
Walt, we haven't been
to Dr. Monaghan's house yet.

556
00:32:58,873 --> 00:33:01,250
You know,
maybe the missing files are there.

557
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,693
Okay, Ferg, um, go to the hospital,

558
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,570
see if you can convince
someone to give you

559
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,989
the name of that suicidal patient
that Dr. Monaghan visited last week.

560
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,282
Vic, we'll go to Donna's.

561
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,374
Was there something else?

562
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,754
Well...

563
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,421
Not really.

564
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,841
No, I was just checking
to see if you were okay.

565
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,718
What happened to your eye?

566
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,935
I was, uh... it was an accident.

567
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,436
I'm fine.

568
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,396
Good. So am I.

569
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,653
[door closes]

570
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,331
[handle rattles]

571
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,544
[sighs]

572
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:08,296
Doesn't anybody lock their
doors in this state?

573
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,634
Huh.

574
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,469
What?

575
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,807
Nothing. It's just not what
I expected from Donna.

576
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,474
You been here before?

577
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,561
Once.

578
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:28,692
I brought her by after the van
fire to pick up some things.

579
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,028
How long's she lived here?

580
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,696
I'm not sure.

581
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,534
This is a really nice place
for someone working at a V.A. clinic.

582
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,704
Where'd she get her money?

583
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,664
I don't know.

584
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,006
How well do you really know Donna, Walt?

585
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:57,220
These look like the ones
you found in her office.

586
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,143
[door creaks]

587
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,568
[Vic] It's clear.

588
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,823
[grunts]

589
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,284
[Walt] Hey!

590
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,787
Hey!

591
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,039
- Okay, Vic?
- Yeah.

592
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,581
Get up!
Come on.

593
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,327
- Who the hell are you?
- I could ask you the same thing.

594
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,550
I'm the sheriff. Let me see some I.D.

595
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,760
Look, I don't have any.

596
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,095
You don't have a wallet?

597
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,472
- Go ahead.
- Easy.

598
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,307
You can pat me down.

599
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,605
Nothing.

600
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:34,901
What are you doing here?

601
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,445
Visiting my mom.

602
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,033
I didn't know that Donna had a son.

603
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:44,953
Neither did I.

604
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,046
Hi, there. Sorry to bother you.

605
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,672
Uh, my name is Deputy Ferguson

606
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,678
with the Absaroka County
Sheriff's Department.

607
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,260
That explains the outfit.

608
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,428
Right.

609
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,849
Uh, anyway,
I'm one of the lead investigators

610
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,683
on a missing-persons case.

611
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,852
I'm really hoping you can
help me with something.

612
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:11,127
I.D.?

613
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,357
Okay.

614
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:24,201
Now, our missing person interacted
with someone here a few days ago.

615
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,703
A patient who had recently
attempted suicide.

616
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:28,956
I'm hoping you can tell me...

617
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,540
- Can't.
- No?

618
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,384
I mean,
I think if you'll let me explain...

619
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,003
Then I would just be
wasting both of our time.

620
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,256
Look,
this was one of Dr. Monaghan's patients,

621
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,050
and Dr. Monaghan is our
missing person, so...

622
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:44,554
So take it up with someone
in administration.

623
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,305
The doctor can be in real danger.

624
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,433
Above my pay grade, Detective Ferguson.

625
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,648
[sighs]

626
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,154
Hey, listen.

627
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,365
I don't know what you've
been telling everybody,

628
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,611
- but I never met you before in my life.
- Excuse me?

629
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,494
So, stop going around telling people

630
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,872
that I'm the one that gave
you the name Tamar Smith.

631
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,438
I'm sorry. I think you have me
confused with somebody else.

632
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:16,133
Right, because I'm not the one who gave
you the name of Dr. Monaghan's patient.

633
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,881
I don't know how you got it.

634
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,466
Tamar Smith?

635
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,858
[sighs]

636
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,818
[door opens]

637
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:45,115
It took you guys that
long to Google a name?

638
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,911
That's not how we do it, Andy.

639
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,578
It's Andrew.

640
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,707
Right. Andrew Price.

641
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,586
We're still waiting on the San
Francisco P.D. to confirm that.

642
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,881
[scoffs]
They sending it via the Pony Express?

643
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,548
Well, it'd be a lot quicker

644
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,509
if you hadn't left your
wallet in California.

645
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,678
Look, man, I'm telling you,
Donna Monaghan is my mother.

646
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,264
Can't you just call her?

647
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,474
Why don't you have the
same last name, Andrew?

648
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:14,227
I kept my father's name.

649
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,938
Well, if you're her
son, why did you run?

650
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,858
'Cause I thought you were someone else.

651
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,445
[sighs]

652
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,238
I'm in a little financial trouble,

653
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,033
and not all my investors
are very patient.

654
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,492
What kind of financial trouble?

655
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,078
The kind where you don't have the money.

656
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:37,876
Look, starting a nightclub isn't easy,
and financing is, well, creative.

657
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,837
Right. Like stealing
from your supposed mother

658
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:41,964
when she's not around.

659
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,840
Uh, what's that quote?

660
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:46,284
Family are the ones who,
when you have nowhere left to go,

661
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,760
they have to take you in.

662
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,183
Robert Frost.

663
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:56,978
Uh, actually, it's home, not family.

664
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,649
Either way, Donna never mentioned you.

665
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,153
Oh, I get it now.

666
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,654
You're screwing her.

667
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,697
Funny. I mean, you're
not really her type.

668
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,700
She does like to mix it up, though.

669
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,954
Unpredictability has led her
to be attracted to all sorts of guys.

670
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,957
Oh, I'm real sorry.
You're... you're not the first.

671
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,833
But I'd be careful, though.

672
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,128
My pops is still all
messed up about her.

673
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,381
When'd you see your mother last?

674
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,134
Uh, we rang in the New Year together,
actually.

675
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,261
She gave me a list of resolutions,

676
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:34,307
a list of ways I could be a more
successful, more miserable person.

677
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,517
She calls it being a realist.

678
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,394
I say it's her being a bitch.

679
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,438
Well, you seem angry with her.

680
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,441
You think I'm exaggerating.

681
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,484
You just wait.

682
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,320
Donna's missing.

683
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,573
Like I said, she does what she
wants whenever she wants.

684
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,992
Not this time.

685
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,576
She's been abducted.

686
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,871
Well, if I were you,
I'd check the previous guy.

687
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,748
- What previous guy?
- I don't know, man.

688
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:03,962
But there's always a previous boyfriend.
She does tend to overlap.

689
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,005
Not everyone takes too kindly to that.

690
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,343
[knock on door, door opens]

691
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,552
- [Ferg] Sheriff.
- Yeah?

692
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,475
Ferg.

693
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,478
Lock him up and see if
anything he's saying is true.

694
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:25,817
And I need you to look into
Donna's ex-husband, any other, um...

695
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,361
- Boyfriends?
- Uh-huh.

696
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,363
- Do you have something else?
- Yeah.

697
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,991
I got the name of Donna's
suicidal patient.

698
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,179
Good afternoon, sir.

699
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,389
Ma'am.

700
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,973
Are you Tamar Smith?

701
00:41:58,058 --> 00:41:59,309
Yes, sir.

702
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,311
- Did I do something wrong, sir?
- No.

703
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,980
No, we just need to ask you
a few questions, Tamar.

704
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,816
About what?

705
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:10,444
About Dr. Monaghan. She's missing.

706
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,573
We're talking to the last people
who might've seen her.

707
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:17,077
How do you know that I even know her?

708
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,496
The V.A. clinic felt compelled
to give us a list of her patients.

709
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,541
When was the last time
you saw Dr. Monaghan, Tamar?

710
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,378
About three or four days ago.

711
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:30,298
When you did last see her,
was that at the clinic in Sheridan?

712
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,985
No, ma'am. I don't go to that clinic.

713
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,093
It's...

714
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,345
It's a little scary.

715
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,972
There's a lot of crazies there.

716
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,474
[chuckles]

717
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,476
Where do you see her?

718
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:46,980
Dr. Monaghan makes house calls.
She has a mobile unit.

719
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,649
Really like a van.

720
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,527
That mobile unit was
firebombed a few days ago.

721
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,903
Firebombed?

722
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:54,197
Someone broke a window

723
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,199
and threw a Molotov cocktail inside.

724
00:42:56,366 --> 00:43:00,995
That was just this past Tuesday
between 3:00 and 3:30 in the afternoon.

725
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:02,538
Where were you then?

726
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:07,919
Do you know anything about that?

727
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:10,338
Um...

728
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:17,345
Okay, Tamar, we're gonna need
to take a look around inside.

729
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:18,846
Yeah.

730
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:43,204
So, I'm still waiting for you to tell me

731
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:47,667
where you were between
3:00 and 3:30 on Tuesday.

732
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:51,462
I was in the hospital, sir.
I had an accident.

733
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,592
Well, I'm glad you're okay now.

734
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:03,516
Are you okay?

735
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,645
Not really.

736
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:12,275
Dr. Monaghan would tell
me to talk it out.

737
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:16,321
Hold on a second.

738
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,953
Here's the thing.

739
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,750
You make me nervous, sir.

740
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,546
You look a lot like my
commanding officer.

741
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:39,761
And he was pretty...

742
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,971
commanding.

743
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:57,279
I'll reach out to the hospital and
confirm what time she was discharged.

744
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,948
You gonna pass out again?

745
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,160
- What?
- Jesus, Walt.

746
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:07,038
Sit down. You look terrible.

747
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,482
And you're having a hard time
focusing on what I'm saying.

748
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:12,209
I'm fine. I... I just wasn't
listening to you, Vic.

749
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,877
- I, uh...
- Oh.

750
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,631
I was thinking about Molotov cocktails.

751
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,133
What about them?

752
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:24,722
Throwing a Molotov cocktail into a van
is a different act than overdosing.

753
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:28,016
One's aggressive, the other's passive.

754
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,645
Different people.

755
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,606
Donna always said it was a patient.

756
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:37,610
Um, I assumed it was the
same suicidal patient

757
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,695
she was visiting at the hospital, but...

758
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,490
She also said that they missed
a couple of appointments.

759
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:43,700
Four.

760
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,618
Their last four appointments.

761
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,955
One of the things that I took from
Donna's house was her calendar.

762
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:52,249
Maybe we can figure out which patient
missed her last four sessions.

763
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:53,668
Yeah.

764
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,464
[sighs]

765
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,187
Are you kidding me?

766
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:18,233
I told you,
you have to take those files back.

767
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,277
This is serious.

768
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,242
Dad?

769
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,870
What am I missing?

770
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,956
What?

771
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,253
I can't remember anything.

772
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:42,634
I, uh... I should be the one to...
to help her,

773
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:45,302
to know everything that happened,

774
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:50,516
but... it's like a fog that won't lift.

775
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,939
It's not your fault.

776
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:03,112
You were shot and you have a concussion.

777
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,533
You were there.

778
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:09,035
- What did I miss?
- I don't know.

779
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:13,415
When I walked in, you were on the floor,

780
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:18,420
and then I-I ran into your room
and I found a bloody sheet,

781
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,630
and I brought it back to
try and stop the bleeding.

782
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,717
And then I called 911.

783
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,219
Did I say anything?

784
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,762
Where is she?

785
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,350
You kept saying, "Where is she?"

786
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:36,729
I thought you meant Mom.

787
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,191
Right.

788
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,735
I'm sorry.

789
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,737
If I'd known,

790
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,865
maybe I could've gotten Vic and Ferg
to start searching for Donna sooner.

791
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,284
It's my fault.

792
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,495
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Donna.

793
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,122
I just... I didn't know...

794
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,749
That I'd like it.

795
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:03,213
You were protecting my feelings.
I get it.

796
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,718
And I appreciate it.

797
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,345
And I'm also pretty sick of it.

798
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,932
'Cause I do the same thing.

799
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,476
You know, I-I keep secrets from you

800
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,438
because I don't want to disappoint you.

801
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,439
What secrets?

802
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,649
Not now.

803
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,153
What secrets, Cady?

804
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,076
I got a job.

805
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,247
Congratulations.

806
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,794
I'm working for Jacob Nighthorse.

807
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:46,466
[footsteps approaching]

808
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,509
Not now, Vic.

809
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,886
Okay.

810
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,513
[door closes]

811
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:54,682
I'm not working directly for him,

812
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,393
but he's funding a legal-aid
operation on the Res,

813
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:59,020
and he asked me to run it.

814
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,483
That's why I came to your cabin.

815
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:06,026
I came to tell you, Dad.

816
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,738
I think this job is the perfect
opportunity because...

817
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,406
Because you're my daughter.
He's using you.

818
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:13,868
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Think about it.

819
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,410
I did.

820
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:18,163
This casino is here
whether we like it or not.

821
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:24,003
And if I can use those
funds to help people...

822
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,088
I think Mom would've liked that.

823
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:29,383
I know this hurts you, Dad.

824
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,385
Just like the idea of someone
taking Mom's place hurts me.

825
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,893
But I think it's time we
move on with our lives

826
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,061
without secrets.

827
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:54,282
You said you took a bloody sheet
from my room to stop my bleeding.

828
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:57,035
What?

829
00:49:57,202 --> 00:50:00,623
Are you sure there was already blood
on the sheet when you used it?

830
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,669
Yeah.

831
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,423
I have to get back to work.

832
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,806
So do I.

833
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,098
[door opens]

834
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,516
- Hey.
- Vic.

835
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,685
- Donna was shot.
- What?

836
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,437
There were two blood
spots in my bedroom.

837
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,560
We missed the second one
because it was on a sheet

838
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,315
that Cady used to stop my bleeding.

839
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,485
Shit, okay. Well, then I
think I know who shot her.

840
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,573
Duncan Butler. He missed
his last four sessions with Donna,

841
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,617
just like the guy that she mentioned
after her van was firebombed.

842
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:38,703
Good work, Detective.

843
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,791
[Walt] Are you Duncan Butler?

844
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,334
Look, I turned my music down,
for Christ's sakes, all right?

845
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,629
Why don't you just go
tell the Reynolds to lay off?

846
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,473
You were here three
days ago playing music?

847
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,340
- No, I was at work three days ago.
- Oh.

848
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,884
Well, can your wife verify that?

849
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,427
She can tell you I wasn't here,

850
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,304
and my boss can tell you I was there.

851
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,723
And where is "there"?

852
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,850
Continental Meats in Sheridan.

853
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,351
[Walt] Oh, Sheridan, huh?

854
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:06,021
Well, you wouldn't happen
to know a Donna Monaghan?

855
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:07,398
She works out that way.

856
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,774
No.

857
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,611
Well, she's not the psychiatrist

858
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,237
you've been seeing the last two years?

859
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,698
God damn it! She's not
supposed to talk about that.

860
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,283
- You seem like you're angry with her.
- Yeah, wouldn't you be?

861
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,651
That shit's supposed to be confidential,
and she goes and sics the sheriff on me.

862
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:24,331
She didn't sic me on you.
She didn't tell me anything about you.

863
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,167
Well, if she didn't tell you,

864
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,530
then you must've broken some laws
finding out I see her.

865
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:30,129
You know what, I'm calling the ACLU.

866
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,973
When you talk to them,
make sure to mention

867
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,676
that we're investigating someone
who set a van on fire.

868
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:38,053
- Is that what she told you?
- Like I said, she hasn't told me anything.

869
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,766
Because Donna Monaghan is missing.

870
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,225
Do you know anything about that?

871
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,730
Shit. Get around back.

872
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,400
[gunshot]

873
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,729
All right. Let's go get her.

874
00:51:54,753 --> 00:51:55,754
Hey!
[grunts]

875
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:57,740
Come on.
Drop the gun!

876
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,743
- Whoa, whoa.
- Drop the gun.

877
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,290
Come on.

878
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,379
Look, if she's missing,
we got to go find her.

879
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:09,669
Who's next on your list?

880
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,963
- Right now, there's just you.
- What?

881
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,808
Look, I didn't firebomb her van,
all right?

882
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,258
I sure as hell didn't kidnap her.

883
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:19,178
Then you won't mind if my deputy and me

884
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,722
take a good look around your home.

885
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,853
Fine.

886
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:35,569
Hey, but every minute you're in there
is a minute we're not looking for Donna.

887
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,822
Okay.

888
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:41,868
Well, thanks for your help.

889
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,786
Yep.

890
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:45,079
[sighs]

891
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,832
His boss at Continental Meats confirms

892
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,675
he was in the middle
of an eight-hour shift

893
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:53,086
when Donna's van got firebombed.

894
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,339
He was also working when she
and I were attacked, so...

895
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,885
So, I guess that leaves
the mysterious Andrew Price.

896
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:02,137
What do you think our next step is?

897
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,890
Well, I think my next step is sleep.

898
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,391
Seriously?

899
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,143
I mean, that's good.

900
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,686
You're finally talking some sense.

901
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,688
- I'll give you a ride to Henry's.
- No.

902
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:15,692
No, I need you to head upstairs,
see if anybody confirmed Andrew's story,

903
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,028
or see if the APB's generated any leads.

904
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,490
- Okay.
- Have Ruby call Henry to come pick me up.

905
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:22,825
Get some rest, Walt.

906
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,300
What?

907
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,386
I said nothing.

908
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,972
Yeah, but it's in how you said nothing.

909
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,516
- Speak.
- We should not be doing this.

910
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,726
What?

911
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:53,480
Trying to find the man who attempted to
kill Gab and me at the Crow Reservation

912
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,232
and might have Donna?

913
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,026
I am not saying that Walker
Browning should be ignored,

914
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,911
but maybe given your physical state
and the lawsuit you are facing...

915
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:05,242
Look, you can drive me and keep
your thoughts to yourself,

916
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,619
or you can set me out right here.

917
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:11,164
But you cannot drive me and
judge me at the same time.

918
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,631
[gear cranks]

919
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,676
Seriously?

920
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,970
You're gonna make me get out here?

921
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:27,014
No.

922
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:30,183
But I do not know which way to turn.
I have never been here before.

923
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:51,454
Barracks another half mile further on.

924
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,623
The active rig should be right here.

925
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,880
[engine idling]

926
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,759
Hey, shut it off.

927
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:05,677
[engine quiets]

928
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:10,766
Shut it off.

929
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,226
[engine stops]

930
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,352
Who are you?

931
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:15,228
Doug.

932
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,646
What's going on here, Doug?

933
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,814
Doing my job.

934
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,066
You work for Newett Energy?

935
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:20,902
I do this week.

936
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:23,863
I'm a private contractor.
Shutdown engineer.

937
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:26,281
Newett determined these
wells were unproductive,

938
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,951
so they called us in to
plug it and close up shop.

939
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:31,287
When'd they make that decision?
[cellphone ringing]

940
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,247
Called us two days ago.

941
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,790
Two days ago.

942
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:37,043
You know Walker Browning?

943
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:38,752
No, never heard of him.

944
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:41,546
- Hello?
- Hey, I got a job for you, Hector.

945
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,215
<i>Now is not a good time.</i>

946
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:45,634
I'm not sure you understand
how this deal works.

947
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,886
<i>I'm with the sheriff.</i>

948
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,803
<i>Oh, great. Put him on.</i>

949
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:51,891
<i>I got some blood samples I'd
like to share with him.</i>

950
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:55,227
Look, Henry, you don't get to
choose what's a good time or not.

951
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,062
I need Hector now.

952
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,982
I'm probably an hour away.

953
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:01,858
I'll see you in 45 minutes.

954
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:02,944
[cellphone beeps]

955
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:05,112
[cellphone beeps]
Henry.

956
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:12,119
We got to get over to Newett headquarters,
figure out where they relocated Walker.

957
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,079
I cannot do that.

958
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:16,623
- Why not?
- I have someplace I have to be.

959
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,006
Do not make me leave you out here.

960
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,891
[truck door opens]

961
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:56,913
[distant] Dad!

962
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,086
[sighs]

963
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,444
[telephone ringing]

964
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,576
[sighs]

965
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:36,537
Hello?

966
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,913
[Coroner] <i>Hey, I'm calling
from the Cumberland morgue.</i>

967
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:41,375
<i>- Sheriff around?</i>
- Speaking.

968
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,627
<i>Hey, uh, I had a note
that you were interested</i>

969
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,464
<i>in any blonde Jane Does
in the 45 to 55 range.</i>

970
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,758
Yeah. Why?

971
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,636
<i>'Cause I got one.</i>

972
00:57:54,819 --> 00:58:02,565
