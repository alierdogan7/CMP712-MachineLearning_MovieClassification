Thank you.

I've put Cheyenne behind me.

I'm in trouble, Eva.

215
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,867
Durant, he hired us.

Nobody was supposed to get hurt...

217
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:07,440
But Shea...

218
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,679
He killed Delaney.

219
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:17,483
We killed that soldier today.

220
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:22,522
Listen here, Mickey.

221
00:21:22,557 --> 00:21:24,991
Shea won't blink at killing Durant.

222
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:27,527
And he's been trouble ever since
he showed up in Cheyenne.

00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:39,072
You've got to kill that mad dog.

Look at my face.

00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:48,281
What is it you see here that makes
you think I'd murder my own kin?

00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,789
You know I'm right.

229
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:26,452
DURANT: Charming.

230
00:22:27,288 --> 00:22:28,588
What's that, Fatty?

231
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:35,995
You remind me of a gorilla
I saw once in a traveling circus.

232
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:38,664
Only the gorilla had better breeding.

233
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:43,284
You'd be wise to mind your hole
or I'm liable to give y'another.

234
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:47,573
I'd wager your mother dropped
you on your head more than once

well know, can be slippery.

Oh.

00:23:40,595 --> 00:23:43,162
I think I've a notion of who
you're wantin' for this.

246
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:04,650
I've not seen my cousin anywhere
since this whole thing started.

247
00:24:07,922 --> 00:24:09,889
Pains me to say it,

248

He's killed Delaney.

251
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:25,972
He'll kill Durant, too.

252
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:31,744
We both know what he's capable of.

253
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:34,347
You saw him take out a man's eye.

254
00:24:34,382 --> 00:24:35,681
I did.

255
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:43,322

What in hell made him think that?

00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,820
Well, we needed a credible threat
for Durant, so I told him.

not until Thomas Durant

You're too late, Miss Ellison.

297
00:27:55,997 --> 00:27:59,131
Johnny Shea killed Mr. Delaney
and kidnapped Durant.

298
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:00,600
McGinnes turned him in.

299
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:02,068

No loyalty amongst rats.

Maggie,

302
00:28:10,478 --> 00:28:13,579
Durant told you he wired for
money to pay off the ranchers?

303
00:28:13,615 --> 00:28:14,747
Yes.

304
00:28:17,051 --> 00:28:19,678
I've been through the books.
There's no wire.

305
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:22,922
- He sold his personal stock.
- No, he didn't.

306
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:27,526
He's broke.

307
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:33,613

00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:37,937
- That's one way to solve that problem.
- A man was killed.

- Your friend, murdered.
- Yes, and I wasn't.

I'm not lucky to be alive.

311
00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:52,852
I think Shea was told not to kill me
on that train by Thomas Durant.

312
00:28:52,887 --> 00:28:56,989
What you are suggesting is beyond absurd.
This isn't a dime novel.

You don't know what happened
on that train, Louise.

You were there but you don't know.

315
00:29:04,198 --> 00:29:07,942
I'm telling you, Maggie.
Shea was following orders.

316
00:29:09,337 --> 00:29:14,064
Unpack that cash.
I'll squander neither money nor lives.

317
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,642
- We wait.
- Your waiting is gonna get him killed.

318
00:29:16,678 --> 00:29:19,045
- We only have a few hours before...
- Listen to me...

319
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,048
Miss Ellison may just be right.

320
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:24,984
Durant is just the kind of
man to do such a thing,

321
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:27,253
arrange his own kidnapping.

322
00:29:28,823 --> 00:29:32,325
- No.
- If she's wrong, if we're wrong...

323
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,527
Durant's no worse off than he is now.

324
00:29:34,562 --> 00:29:39,465
If we're right, won't be long before
he waltzes through that door.

325
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:43,001
Of course, he'll have to stand trial

326
00:29:43,026 --> 00:29:46,608
for what
befell his chief engineer on that train.

327
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:55,915
Fine.

328
00:30:00,455 --> 00:30:02,088
Do what you want.

329
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:09,161
Bring me Mickey McGinnes.

330
00:30:28,716 --> 00:30:32,084
DURANT: John Campbell is not
going to let the murderer

331
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,421
of the chief engineer of the
Union Pacific railroad go free.

332
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:39,158
He will hunt your cousin
down until he finds him.

333
00:30:39,193 --> 00:30:41,694
And when he finds him... (INHALES)

334
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:46,132
Do you think we can rely
on that thing up there?

335
00:30:50,238 --> 00:30:54,540
It would be prudent to tie things off.

336
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,209
No loose ends.

337
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:01,414
You're absolutely right.

338
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:04,717
That would be the prudent thing to do.

339
00:31:05,787 --> 00:31:10,756
So when these bastards get here,
and drop that money off,

340
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:15,361
that thing up there and
me are gonna take it

341
00:31:15,396 --> 00:31:17,396

No, you're not.

That's what we're doing. There's not
a damn thing you can do about it,

word out of your mouth.

were worth saving.

Come on.

350
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,325
There's $50,000 in there.
You just take it and go.

351
00:32:29,103 --> 00:32:31,437
Look, we need to take this money
and get the hell out of here. Now.

352
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:33,939
Take the damn money.
Take it and get of here.

353
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:37,243
$250,000. Not 50.

354
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:38,310
It's not enough.

355
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:39,645
It's enough for the life that we want.

356
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,480

the masked man boarded my car.

Dandy Johnny Shea, I later found out.

374
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:56,268
He shoots my chief engineer,
thoroughly unprovoked,

375
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,271

we moved again.

382
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:24,195
She was a good woman.

383
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,831

00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,669
Anyway,

385
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,472
I was meeting a man out at
Soda Springs when it happened.

386
00:35:35,642 --> 00:35:36,875
He sells these.

387
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:40,278
Grapefruit.

388
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,083
A bit more bitter than I'd hoped.

389
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,054

DURANT: When the time came,

396
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:13,411
Maggie Palmer rode up over the ridge.

397
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,415
She had a sack of money.

398
00:36:18,452 --> 00:36:22,387
And Dandy Johnny Shea...
He picked up the bag,

399
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:27,592
shot her dead
and rode away, if I had to guess.

400
00:36:29,363 --> 00:36:32,464
- Where would he go?
- MICKEY: Christ if I know.

401
00:36:32,499 --> 00:36:36,368
Uh... I'd start anyplace
that sells liquor or whores.

402
00:36:37,437 --> 00:36:39,270
He could still be in Wyoming.

403
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:42,941
He could be in New York.

404
00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:46,819
Uh, California...

405
00:36:49,116 --> 00:36:50,315

406
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:53,475

00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:15,006
I don't know, John.

411
00:37:19,346 --> 00:37:23,782
Maybe he got tired of all the death.

412
00:37:27,587 --> 00:37:29,020
I know I am.

413
00:37:36,096 --> 00:37:38,029
I'm free to go, I assume.

414
00:37:55,248 --> 00:37:57,782

00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:02,187

416
