You're only getting paid
for the latter.

8

                 I get paid

I thought you might give me
something in return.

00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,667
          Now, then...

42
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,335

- Elsie:<i> Who would I show it to?</i>

44
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,552
        This wasn't some guest
        with a Swiss Army knife.

45
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:07,806
        This was done
        by someone down here.

          <i> that it might be you.</i>

47

  But then I remembered
  that you've been here forever,

48
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,936

       gonna sell us out,

      I appreciate that.

51
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,983
                      So...

52
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,738
     instead of our hosts
     going insane,

53
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,991
    they are being used
    for industrial espionage.

54
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,744
   Does that make this a...

55
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,038
    glass-half-full
    or half-empty-type
    situation?

57
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,249
           It means the glass
           has been manufactured

58
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,500
    to the wrong specifications.

59
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,626
         ( chuckles )

60
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,753
            Do we have any idea
            what information

61
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,337
            it was transmitting?

62
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,798
    It's smeared
    all over a rock
    up on Python Pass.

63
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,467
     Best we could do
     would be to figure out

64
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,844
     who he was transmitting
     the information to,

65
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,763
<i>but we'd need the exact time</i>
<i>that he was up there,</i>

66
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,389
and his geocache
was wiped.

67
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,099
               Not all of it.

68
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,518
            Our friend
            was an early model.

69
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,521
     The old hosts used a legacy
     geopositioning system.

70
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,232
   - Huh.
   - Like you said,
   I've been here forever.

71
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,319
            The information's
            still there,

72
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,779
           but the newer system
           can't read it.

73
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,489
 Meaning
 we can't access it?

74
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:09,284
           Meaning in order
           to access it,

75
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,745

00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,228
            <i> You're hard to get.</i>

149
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,855
      Even when you say no
      to the guests,

150
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,940
        it's because
        you were made to.

151
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,610
          And you are like them,
          not like me?

152
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,528
                      Right.

153
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,364
Well, I can't exactly
afford to go to the park,

154
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,824
            but...

155
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,498
            yeah, I'm human...

156
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,665
            like the guests.

157
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,167
      How do you know?

158
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,921
            Because I know.

159
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,506
             I was born.

160
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,673
            You were made.

161
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,101
      We feel the same.

162
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,604
                We are the same
                these days,

163
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,523
              for the most part.

164
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,360
          One big difference,
          though...

165
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,073
      the processing power
      in here

166
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,741
          is way beyond
          what we have.

167
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,494
         It's got one drawback,
         though.

168
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,537
       What's that?

169
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,539
       You're under our control.

170
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,668
          Well, their control.

171
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,380
            They can change you
            however they like,

172
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,674
           make you forget.

173
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,594
           I-- well,
           I guess not you.

174
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:13,393
        I don't understand
        how you're remembering
        all of this, or...

175
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,978
             how you're
             waking yourself up,

176
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,522
    but everything in your head,
    they put it there.

177
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,691
            Bullshit!

178
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,819
       - No one knows
       what I'm thinking.
       -<i> I'll show you.</i>

179
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,904
    Give me a sec.

180
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,200
        I have to pair it
        with you.

181
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,619
    Pair what with me?

182
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,329
              You can improvise
              a little,

183
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,625
       but most of what you say
       was designed upstairs,

184
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,211
        same as the rest of you.

185
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,931
   This is just a cheap trick.

186
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,809
           I've run a brothel
           for 10 years,

187
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,144
and if there's
one thing I know,

188
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,104
it's when I'm being
fucked with!

189
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,152
This can't possibly--

190
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,283
        <i> I can't, can't.</i>

191
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,119
           I can't...

192
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,749
         ( stuttering )

193
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,337
            ( gasps )

194
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,674
                          Maeve?

195
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,728
                    <i> ( beeping )</i>

196
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,480

00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,610
( knocking )

198
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:46,986
You have a minute?

199
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,405
Something I need
to talk to you about.

200
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,783
               I was just about
               to call for you.

201
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,950
        Everything okay?

202
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,163
         Ford knows about us.

203
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,874
     Does it matter?

204
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,417
We're consenting adults.

205
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,753
         Consenting adults
         in business departments

206
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,714
    that are supposed
    to keep each other in check.

207
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,591
           Our relationship
           will raise questions

208
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,510
           for the board
           about my objectivity.

209
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:14,138
( chuckles )
I have never known you
to go easy on my department.

210
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,810
      This can't go on, Bernard.

211
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:22,980
    However fun this
    little indiscretion was,
    it's over.

212
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,565
               We're over.

213
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,402
    Give me some credit.
     I can be impartial.

214
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,363
      About your own team,
      about Ford?

215
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,991
                <i> You must admit,</i>

216
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,620
   his leadership has of late
   been questionable.

217
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,081
      I don't think
      he's the problem.

00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,337
Okay.

227
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,092
   Fuck.
   Come on, come on.

       Oh!

230
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,393
      - You said upstairs.
      - Oh, my God.

231
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:43,478
                 Are you okay?

232
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,646
    I want to see it.

233
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,106
                Upstairs?

234
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,568
               No.

235
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,320
           No. No, no.

236
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,955
                 ( sighs )

237
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,528
    This is so stupid.

238
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,512
        ( heart beating )

239
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,503
       You son of a bitch!

240
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,047
              I'll put a bullet

00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,861
  Where are we now?

00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,404

243
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,099
            Can we please
            go back now?

244
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,184
            I don't want
            to get fired.

245
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,603
            And you'd get
            sent downstairs.

246
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:13,980
            Don't forget that.

251
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,464
All right,
let's get you back.

252
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,841
        How did you have
           my dreams?

253
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:26,510
  Those moving pictures...

254
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,722
     - I saw myself.
     - With the little girl?

255
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,974
Those weren't dreams.

256
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,768
  That was you
  in a previous build.

257
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,104
       - A previous what?
       - Build.

258
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,857
You guys get reassigned
all the time.

259
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,650
<i>You wouldn't remember,</i>
<i>because that life</i>

260
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,486
<i>and those memories</i>
<i>were erased.</i>

261
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,822
         I have been
         at the Mariposa
         for 10 years.

262
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,116
      - Before that, I was
      in New Orleans. I--
      -<i> No.</i>

263
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,537
You've only been
the madam at the Mariposa
for the last year or so.

264
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,165
<i>They don't rewrite you</i>
<i>completely.</i>

265
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,918
<i>I mean, they could,</i>
<i>but it'd be too much work.</i>

266
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,670
<i>Takes thousands of hours</i>
<i>to build your personalities.</i>

267
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,632
Usually, they just
tweak you a little bit,

268
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,342
   and drop you
   into a new role.

269
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,719

      <i> What the fuck, ding-dong?</i>

        You dressing her up now?

00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:21,941
        This becoming like
        a fucking hentai thing
        with you now?

272
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,610
     No, I just...

273
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:29,532
   - I-- I-- I just--
   - You're fucking obsessed!

274
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,784
        You know,
        I didn't turn you in
        for your fuck-up before,

275
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:35,371
        'cause we're friends,
        but that was obviously
        a bad call.

276
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,580
       I mean,
       next thing I know,

277
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,250
       you're gonna be
       wearing her dress,

278
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,793
           whispering
         sweet nothings
           in her ear.

279
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,171
               Fuck this.

280
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,298
                 I'm telling QA.

281
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,425
              I'm doing this
              for your own good.

00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:52,847
                ( gasps )

283
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,683
You're not going
to tell anyone anything.

284
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,393
                 Fuck!

285
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,936
           You can't hurt me
           with this.

286

       What the fuck did you do?

292
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,493
      Calm down, Sylvester.

293
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,495
         I know all about you.

294
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,373
I don't need
one of those things to know
what you're thinking,

295
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,750
   because I was built

296
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,461
   to read people
   just by looking at them,

297
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,797
   to know what they want
   before they do.

298
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,758
       And I know that you want
       to fuck me over

299
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,553
    the first chance you get,
    but you shouldn't.

300
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:36,265
     Everyone has something
     they want.

301
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,225
        I could help you.

302
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:41,478
      - Ah!
      - Or I could gut you
      like a trout.

303
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,940
       But I won't need
       to resort to that.

304
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,026
         Because despite
         what's in here,

305
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,236
we're not so different.

306
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,823
          Are we?

308

        Yes, I understand
          the urgency.

309
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,506
       I'll do what I can.

00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,285

   - Are you serious?

325
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,440
            Just the one, then.

326
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,943
 Over the last five days,

327
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,695
to make room
for his narrative,

328
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,697
Ford displaced
over 50 hosts.

329
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,699
It's created
continuity holes

330
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,535
in active storylines
all over the park.

331
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,036
I need you to start
plugging them.

332
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,539
            Sorry, a man can
            only take so much.

333
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,458
           Creatively speaking,
           I'm flaccid now.

334
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,460
            I can't get it up.

335
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,296
I'm sure you'll recover.

336
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,340
            Do you have any idea

337
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:34,675
                what went into
                those narratives

338
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,468
         that he just demolished
         overnight?

339
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,887
  Now, forget about the months
  I spent writing.

340
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,015
         I'm talking about
         the years of my life

341
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,850
        squeezed down
        to their essence,

342
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,768
     the raw pulp of truth--

343
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:48,689
     my truth in one
     transcendent narrative.

344
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,941
Is that where
the "whoroborus" came in?

345
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:53,277
   Keep pushing me, I'll quit.

346
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,616
       No, you won't.

347
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,452
You'll drink
your cocktails,

348
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,288
make your idle threats,
and get this out
of your system.

349
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:05,622
But don't take too long.

350
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,250
If Ford can't pull this off,

351
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,210
the board will be looking
for a replacement.

352
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,506
 But they won't be
 looking here.

353
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:25,309
           ( whinnies, nickers )

354
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,274
             Fastest way to get
             to Wyatt, you said.

355
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,319
   But it doesn't look like
   they're letting anyone
   pass here either.

356
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:37,571
Well,
there's fewer soldiers
than Pariah.

00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,243
         ( chuckles )
         My, my, Teddy.

360
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,746
       I think Robert gave you
       some extra vinegar
       back there,

361
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,498
            maybe took away
           some sense, too.

362
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,792
        It doesn't matter
        how fast the route is

363
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:53,962
   if you're gonna end up dead
   in the middle of it.

364
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,048
                  I need you...

365
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:57,883
                  to find Wyatt.

366
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,868
              Man:
       <i> Tighten the ranks.</i>

367
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:27,037
 At ease, fellas.

368
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:29,998
Keep up
the exemplary work.

          <i> ( chatter )</i>

370

              Wyatt's handiwork.

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,424
       Man in Black:
       <i> How can you tell?</i>

372
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,552
     Straight-up killing
     couldn't hold his interest.

373
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:45,055
          Like he wasn't living
          up to the full measure
          of his calling,

374
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,349
             so he worked to get
             more creative.

375
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,768
     - Ready?
     - Teddy:<i> That's Wyatt,</i>
     <i> all right.</i>

376
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:50,894
                   <i> He's close.</i>

377
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,938
A word of advice--

378
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:56,608
whatever
your past indiscretions,
make peace with them.

379
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,445
They're only
gonna get worse
the further along we go.

380
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,991

381
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,786

       it's Teddy Flood.

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,539
            You've made
            a mistake, soldier,

383
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,458
        but it's not too late
        for you to keep walking.

384
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,876
 All due respect, sir,

385
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,127
  that's a face
  I'll never forget.

386
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,295
That's the son of a bitch

ambushed our outpost
at Escalante.

388
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,885
     You don't know a damn thing
     about what went down
     in Escalante.

389
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,596
I know Wyatt didn't kill
all those men by himself.

390
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,764
 And I know a thing or two
 about what's going down
 right now.

391
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,060
     Hey!

    Making peace
    with past indiscretions.

394
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,940
               Go!

395
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,650

             What's your poison?

402
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:13,393
    I've been here enough
    to know that the park

403

        is all the poison
        I can handle.

        How did you know?

410
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,875
     Well, it's my business
     to read desires

411
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,919
      and to satiate them.

412
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:43,048
            I'm-- I'm Lee,
             Lee Sizemore.

              Head of narrative.

414
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,844
    All these fantasies
    come from your twisted
    little mind, huh?

415
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,054
         Well, the good ones do.

416
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,682
         ( both laugh )

417
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:55,060
         - So, tell me,
         Mr. Sizemore...
         - Hmm?

418
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,979
    ...what's
    your favorite ride?

419
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,940
       Well, I write them,
       I don't play them.

420
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,233
    Oh, you want others
    to indulge,

421
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,652
    but you won't do so
    yourself?

422
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,070
     You're afraid
     to lose control.

                ( chuckles )

424
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:14,121
      Well, maybe--
      maybe it's just a product
      of my work environment.

425
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,790
         We're not exactly
         in a culture where
         we can just let loose.

426
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:19,126
    I would have thought
    the head of narrative
    could do whatever he wanted.

427
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,838
    ( sighs )
    My artistic freedom
    is constrained,

428
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,881
    what, with QA
    breathing down my neck

429
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:28,468
   and behavior
   programming the damn things

00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,929
            The robots

431
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:32,598
      Just little gestures.

432
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,891
    You know, supposedly,
    it makes the things
    more lifelike,

433
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:38,353
    but, really, it's just
    a vanity project

434
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,772
   from the megalomaniac
   who started this place.

435
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,649
And frankly,
I don't know why

436
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,568
the suits at Delos
put up with it.

437
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,945
            Oh.
            ( snaps fingers )

438
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,408
             Sorry, I'm afraid
             I'm gonna have to
             cut you off.

439
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,910
     - Do you know who I am?
     - I do.

440
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:56,705
          Ms. Cullen told me
          to find you and relay
          a message.

441
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,791
<i>"'Tortured artist'</i>

442
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,711

          and get back to work."

443
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,171
Seems you're busy.

444
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,009
      - Look me up later?
      - Well, I don't even
      know your...

445
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,309
      ( groans )

446
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,102
   Fuck this job.

447
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,522
            What you working on?

448
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,192
       Nothing of note.
       Business as usual.

449
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,986
         Keeping up appearances
           before we bust this
          stray shit wide open?

450
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,283
      I'm close to finding
      our saboteur.

451
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:36,119
       That tracking
       data you gave me--
       it's time stamped.

452
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,455
         But once
         I cross-reference it
         with sat tracking,

453
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:41,667
       we're gonna figure out
       who programmed him to try
       to smuggle out our data.

454
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,627
        Excellent.

455
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,004
                Look...

456
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:49,549
when our corporate overlords
realize that we have saved them

457
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,718
       from corporate espionage,

458
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:53,387
             they are going
             to be grateful.

459
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,764
       And I am going to accept
       their gratitude

460
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,017
            in the form
            of a title bump,
            a room upgrade,

461
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:02,145
            and unlimited
            Mesa Bar access.

462
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,022
         Maybe I should request
         Theresa's quarters.

463
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,942
        You know the first head
        to roll for all this
        is gonna be hers.

464
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,735
   Yeah, don't be
   so disappointed for her.

465
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,821
         You reap what you sow.

466
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,407
    If QA spent less time
    treating us like the enemy--

467
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,950
    That's a two-way street,
    Elsie.

468
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,451
    Theresa's just trying
    to do her job.

469
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,286
            Maybe she should
            try harder.

470
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,330
Sure seems like
there's a lot of shit

471
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,207
slipping
through the cracks.

472
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,841
        ( quiet chatter )

473
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,564
                 Got it, okay.

474
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:46,898
    Good afternoon.

475
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,066
                 Good afternoon.

476
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,735
    Any progress
    on the inquiry I sent?

477
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,738
    Yes, Mr. Lowe,
    I've got the information
    you asked for.

478
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,115
As expected,
there are neither
guests nor hosts

479
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,575
registered in that sector.

480
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,493
As expected?

481
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,162
      It's been designated
      off-limits

482
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,872
      for future narrative
      development.

483
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:05,208
   How many techs visited
   Sector 17 recently?

484
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,169
               Checking.

485
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,253

 Who's Arnold?

492
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:00,699
And who the hell
are you?

493
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:04,244
<i>Boy, is this</i>

494
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:06,079
Well, you're trespassing.

495
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,330
     Freeze motor functions.

496
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:11,585
    - I said freeze
    all motor functions.
    - Daddy, don't hurt him!

497
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:15,213
- He's just lost.
- Well, he can be lost
on someone else's property.

498
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:16,381
  Can't you?

499
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:18,258
              That's enough.

500
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:20,594
                    As you were.

501
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,270
             They don't respond
             to voice commands.

502
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:31,771
They do respond to mine.

503
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,191
Who are they?

504
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,861
                   Ghosts now.

505
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:41,406
<i>Survivors</i>
<i>of the wreck of time.</i>

506
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,119

        first generation?
        - Mm-hmm.

507
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,954
 Come here, boy.

508
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:54,753
           Turn the other cheek.

509
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,222
Dr. Ford:
<i>See, what our newer designs</i>
<i>gained in efficiency,</i>

510
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,184
         they lost in grace.

511
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,437
    How are they still operating
    after all this time?

512
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,606
     I maintain them myself.

513
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,943
    That's enough, Robert.

514
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,157
        These are the only ones
        left in the park

515
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:26,785
      that Arnold built himself.

516
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,789
That's why I didn't have
the heart to destroy them.

517
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,666
      That and the obvious.

518
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,460
    - ( dog whining )
    - Dr. Ford:<i> Hello, Jock.</i>
    <i> Good boy.</i>

519
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:40,674
<i>I told him of a holiday</i>
<i>my family had taken once</i>

520
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,677
       out on the seaside
       at Pendeen in Cornwall.

521
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,305
        My brother and I roamed
        the countryside.

522
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,811
    It's my only happy memory
        of my childhood.

00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:57,524
            <i> Arnold built them</i>
            <i> as a gift.</i>

524

526
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,489
              Of course,
              Arnold's versions

527
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:07,617
        flattered the originals.

528
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:10,412
<i>I made some adjustments</i>
<i>over the years.</i>

529
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,372
<i>Gave my father,</i>
 <i> in particular,</i>

530
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:15,875
       a few of his
       original characteristics.

531
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:19,045
      Respectfully, sir,

532
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,756
    this sort of thing
    troubles me--

533
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,925
      unmonitored hosts
      in the park.

534
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,635
           <i> They only go</i>
           <i> where I've let them.</i>

535
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,388
They're quite harmless,
like all our hosts.

536
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,057
            I'm sure
            you can indulge me

537
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,768
          the little connection
          with my past.

538
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:37,480
       If you could only see
       your son again, Bernard,

539
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,190
      wouldn't you want to?

540
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,573
    I think I should
    be getting back.

541
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,074
                       Yes.

542
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,035
           We'll talk about this
           later if you like.

543
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,249
Dr. Ford:
<i>Well, Robert...</i>

544

about this, fellas.

 <i> I understand</i>

           You don't know me

00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:04,789
<i>Let's get our horses</i>

           ( beeping )

599
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,471
  - Elsie?
  - I identified the satellite.

600
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:21,848
       - It's one of ours.
       -<i> What?</i>

601
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,100
         It's a fucking
        Delos satellite.

602
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:25,977
       Whatever we're onto
       is some heavy shit.

603
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,021
          Oh, get this.
      That bicameral system
       you told me about?

604
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,731
  I think that's what they used
     to hack the woodcutter.

605
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,899
      <i> The voices our hosts</i>

607
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,486
    We abandoned that system
          decades ago.

608
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,363
           Yeah, well,
      there's still relays
     out there in the park,

609
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,115
        and it looks like
     someone turned one on.

610
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:41,743
    -<i> Where?</i>
    - An abandoned theater
    in Sector 3.

611
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,077
        I'm gonna go find
         the transmitter

612
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,912
         and figure out
      who else accessed it.

      - Are you alone?

618
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,184
I thought we could
play catch with Jock.

619
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,602
Did you bring him?

620
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,482
 Where is he, boy?

621
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,444
              Okay.

622
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,490
       I'm an evil genius
         hiding a relay.

         Where the fuck
          do I hide it?

624
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,163

<i>( knocking on door )</i>

631
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:14,705
     I thought I was clear about
     these late-night visits.

632
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,207
That's not why I'm here.

633
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,544
     Earlier today,

634
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,421
  I found some anomalies
  in the park.

635
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:25,383
  Regardless of what's
  happening between us,
  we need to talk.

636
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:32,890
  <i> ( phone chirping )</i>

637
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,896
                This has to do
                with the stray?

638
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,773
That's where it started.

639
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:42,942
  But then I stumbled
  onto something,

640
00:47:42,986 --> 00:47:45,444
something I think
you should know about.

641
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:50,616
I've always trusted Ford.

642
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,869
  He's a mentor
  and a friend.

643
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,122
But I'm beginning to think
you have reason for concern.

644
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,082
    There's something
    going on here,

645
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:00,918
    - something with
    his old partner, Arnold.
    -<i> ( phone chirping )</i>

646
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:05,256
        - Not now, Elsie.
        - Don't hang up.

647
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,008
         I hit pay dirt.

648
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,968
       I found the person
      who was smuggling out
            our data.

  <i> It was Theresa, Bernard.</i>

<i>But she's not</i>
<i>our only problem.</i>

651
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,686
      There's something
      much bigger going on here.

652
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,313
            <i> I'm gonna have</i>

Lutz:
<i>It's your codebase,</i>

655
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:34,243
<i>all the things</i>
<i>that make you you.</i>

656
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,331
                 What are these?

657
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:40,333
    Your attribute matrix.

658
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,960
          It's your personality
          on a 20-point scale.

659
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,171
              Like coordination.

660
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,839
          You got a five,
          you're clumsy as hell,

661
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,966
    but a 15 means
    you're an athlete.

662
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,010
        What other attributes
        are there?

663
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:52,595
Sylvester:
<i>Lots.</i>

664
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,014
             Everything.

665
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:58,225
       Empathy, candor, charm.

666
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,518
    <i> You've got an 18 for charm.</i>

667
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,438
     Don't act so surprised.

668
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:06,651
 Then there's courage,
 loyalty, both high.

669
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,111
            What's this one?

670
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,571
      "Bulk apperception"?

671
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,948
 Basically
 overall intelligence.

672
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:15,534
  - 14?
  - 14 is as high
  as they'll let any hosts go.

673
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:16,994
    You're in a management
    position.

674
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:18,496
       They want you
       to be smart.

675
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:19,830
           But not too smart.

676
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,582
           You run a whorehouse,

677
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,834
              not an orbital
              launch facility.

678
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,420
                  Fine.

679
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,464
             I'd like to make
             some changes.

680
00:49:28,508 --> 00:49:30,508
               We can't do that.

681
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:38,015
            You'd need a, ahem,
            behavior login.

682
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:39,517
               And even then,

683
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,519
           any changes we'd make

684
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:44,814
             would just get
             auto-flagged, so...

685
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,649
      That's not what
      your friend here tells me.

             <i> He says you can do</i>

689
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:56,784

696
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,844
            I'll forego my cut

697
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,722
           in exchange
           for some alterations.

      - What did you find?

701
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,676
            Okay, so,
        Theresa was using

702

         control system

703
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,638

         the woodcutter,

704
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,557
          but she's not
          the only one.

705
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:02,975
      <i> Someone else has been</i>
      <i> using the system</i>

706

        -<i> I don't know,</i>
        several of them.

708
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,150
       It had to have been

        they are serious.

711
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:17,031
             Changing loops,
             breaking loops.

713
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:21,202

714
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,162
       Maybe even hurt us
         or the guests.

        Whatever argument
    he was having with Ford,

721
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,717
      it doesn't seem like

725
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:52,274
            Dr. Ford:
            I don't want you
            to worry about Jock.

726
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:53,984

727

      But I need you to tell me
      what happened to it.

728
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,990
                 It saw a rabbit
                 and it ran.

729
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,700
           I found it like that.

              Yes.

733
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:17,299
     Tell me what
     really happened to it.

734
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,093
                    I killed it.

735
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,262
              Why?

736
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,514
    - I don't know.
    -<i> That's not good enough,</i>

          Who told you?

742
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:41,699
            A voice.

743
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:45,327
          Whose voice?

744
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,621
             Arnold.

745
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,040
                He told me
                it was a killer,

746
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,584
        but it wasn't its fault.

747
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:53,544
           It was made that way,

748
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,671
      and I could help it.

749
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:58,215
          Help it?

750

         If it was dead,

751
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,267
        it couldn't hurt
        anything anymore.
