1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:41,338
First, state your name, age,
and the present condition of your health,

2
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,466
and whether in your condition

3
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:49,071
you could travel to attend in person
to Beaver, the court now sitting there.

4
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:56,278
I am Brigham Young. I am in my 75th year.

5
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,992
It would be a great risk
to both my health and life

6
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:05,189
for me to travel to Beaver at this time.

7
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:11,694
Because I am, and have been for some time,
an invalid.

8
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:21,110
Second, what office,
either ecclesiastical, civil or military,

9
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,206
did you hold in the year 1857?

10
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:32,251
I was Governor of the Territory,
ex-officio Superintendent to Indian Affairs,

11
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:39,031
and President of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints,

12
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,067
in the year 1857.

13
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,941
<i>The last time I was here,</i>
<i>I was six months old.</i>

14
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,545
<i>They say you don't remember things</i>
<i>at that age, but I remember feelings.</i>

15
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:14,491
<i>I remember the feel of wooden wagon</i>
<i>wheels bouncing over the rocky ground.</i>

16
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:20,499
<i>I remember the feel of horse hooves</i>
<i>as they pounded across the meadow.</i>

17
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,932
<i>I remember the feelings of love</i>

18
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,631
<i>that flowed through everyone</i>
<i>on that wagon train.</i>

19
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,503
<i>It felt special.</i>

20
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,841
<i>Two different worlds met on this spot,</i>
<i>one of love, the other of hate.</i>

21
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,460
- What is it?
- Riders. Looks like six of them.

22
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,838
<i>Let's</i> go see who we have.

23
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,242
Greetings.

24
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:51,881
<i>I'm</i> Captain Alexander Fancher,
and this is Captain John Baker.

25
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,163
Perhaps you could tell us,
are we close to the supply station?

26
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,524
There is no supply station.

27
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,099
We were told there was a supply station
near here.

28
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,331
No supply station. Best if you keep going.

29
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,876
We need supplies,
which we will happily pay for,

30
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,970
and a resting spot where we can graze
and water our livestock.

31
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,708
We have nothing to sell.

32
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,910
We passed rich fields being cultivated
all across this territory,

33
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,352
- yet you say you have nothing to sell us.
- <i>That's</i> right.

34
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,425
We <i>don't</i> have enough supplies
to get us to California.

35
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,017
Is there a problem, Alexander?

36
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,495
- Seems they <i>don't</i> like strangers.
- Just making sure that you do not stop here.

37
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,532
We're willing to pay top dollar.

38
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:39,162
- Money is the root of all evil.
- What about charity and mercy?

39
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,830
Our livestock need to graze and water.
Our people need rest.

40
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,570
You should have thought about that before.

41
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:53,875
<i>Name's</i> General Jacob Samuelson,
and these are my sons, Jonathan and Micah.

42
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,617
Folks around here call me the Bishop
or the General.

43
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,659
<i>I'm</i> the Bishop of the Church,
the General of the local militia,

44
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,457
and the Mayor all rolled into one.

45
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,589
<i>I'm</i> Captain Alexander Fancher,
one of the leaders of this wagon train.

46
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,670
This is Captain Baker, Nancy Dunlap.

47
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,341
Well, these people here are telling us
to move along.

48
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:19,070
We were hoping to buy provisions
and water and graze our livestock.

49
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,646
We <i>don't</i> come begging.
We're willing to pay.

50
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,806
Not an unreasonable request.

51
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,578
We need to show some Christian charity
here, now <i>don't</i> we?

52
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,620
Thank goodness.

53
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,916
The men here sometimes get a little excited.

54
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,891
We've had many problems with emigrants
using this trail.

55
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,052
<i>I'm</i> sorry to hear that.

56
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,630
So you understand,
we need to check you out

57
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,565
before we decide whether
to help you or not.

58
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,501
Of course. We have nothing to hide.

59
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,770
You stay here.
My sons and I will look things over.

60
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,158
<i>That's</i> a fine animal you're on, sir.

61
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,787
This is One Eyed Blaze.
<i>He's</i> my pride and joy.

62
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:15,027
- Must be worth a pretty penny.
- Two thousand, <i>that's</i> no lie.

63
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,826
Now, what fool would pay so much
for a horse?

64
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,338
A breeding or a gaming man, sir.

65
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,448
You interested in horses, son?

66
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:36,044
We have the best horses
west of the Mississippi with us.

67
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,693
Well, <i>there's</i> nothing here
that looks menacing.

68
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,564
You all seem to be good Christian men
and women.

69
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,001
Thank you, Bishop.

70
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,073
Does this mean you'll let us stay here
and rest awhile?

71
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,903
First, let me ask where you people are from.

72
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,810
Most of us are from Arkansas,
some of us are from Missouri.

73
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,678
Missouri?

74
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,452
Our people need rest, Bishop.

75
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,454
We'll pay double
with American Gold Eagles.

76
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,950
No, of course not.

77
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,052
- One should not pay for what God provides.
- Thank you.

78
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,597
My men will direct you to a place
not very far from here

79
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,361
where you can camp
for no more than two weeks.

80
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,095
You'll be safe from the hostile Indians there.

81
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,502
- Thank you. Thank you very much, Bishop.
- Good day.

82
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:46,048
Did you see those horses?
<i>Weren't</i> they something?

83
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,215
I've never seen horses like that before.

84
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,521
Two thousand dollars for a horse!

85
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,353
A man could have a mansion
with that kind of money!

86
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:00,728
Those horses are going to be used
for gambling. Gambling is a sin.

87
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:06,701
Some of them come from Missouri
and Arkansas.

88
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,208
I want you to keep an eye on the emigrants.

89
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,368
We need to find out more about them.

90
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,843
- We will.
- Yes, Father.

91
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:18,474
I want to know every detail.
<i>There's</i> no telling what could be important.

92
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:25,881
<i>"The woman shall not wear
that which pertaineth unto a man.

93
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,689
<i>"All that do so are abomination
unto the Lord thy <i>God."</i>

94
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,973
Put the horses and wagon away.

95
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:50,947
Dinner is in exactly one hour. <i>Don't</i> be late.

96
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,116
Micah, I expect you and your new wives
to be on time. No excuses.

97
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,655
- Yes, sir.
- You spend too much time with them.

98
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,783
The Prophet recommends that every man
should have at least three wives.

99
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,724
Maybe you should take another one.

100
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,659
What are you smiling at?

101
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:10,263
- You <i>don't</i> even have a single wife yet.
- <i>He's</i> particular.

102
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,163
Too particular if you ask me.

103
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,533
Here, let me take her.

104
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,207
Emily, you've been a godsend
since my Jenny died.

105
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:03,077
Well, you know,
we've all got to help one another, Robert.

106
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,455
You know, the baby needs a mother.

107
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,554
Let us give thanks to the Lord.

108
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,260
We thank you for the food we eat,

109
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:20,099
the shelter that keeps us dry,
the clothes that keep us warm.

110
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:24,108
Thank you for this beautiful place
for us to rest,

111
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,576
and for the animals to feed and drink.

112
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,477
We thank you for delivering
the Gentiles into our hands.

113
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:34,246
Bless the Bishop and his family
for allowing us to stay.

114
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,878
Surely these people are cursed
beyond hope of redemption.

115
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,423
Thank you for showing
the light of Christian charity

116
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:44,827
to those who doubted our motives
for staying in this glorious place.

117
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,457
Cursed are the Gentile dogs
who allow abominations

118
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,559
like that woman in pants who carries a gun.

119
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,298
Curse all the people from Missouri
who drove us from our land

120
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,634
...in <i>Jesus'</i> name.

121
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,700
May these children of Satan go to hell!
Amen.

122
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:27,703
<i>"As he rode along, he wondered what
he would do if he came face to face.

123
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,669
<i>"He had a lot of things..."</i>

124
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,074
A word with you, Captain Fancher?

125
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,170
In private, if you please.

126
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,350
- How long do you plan to stay here?
- The Bishop has allowed us two weeks.

127
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,982
Two weeks?

128
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,061
We need that time for our people to rest,

129
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,653
the animals to get their bellies full,
their strength back.

130
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,967
I have a bad feeling about this place.

131
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:01,165
It <i>isn't</i> safe. And I think
we should move on as soon as possible.

132
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,332
The Bishop himself said <i>we'd</i> be safe here.

133
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,376
I know, but I <i>don't</i> like it.

134
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,944
I have children that depend upon me.

135
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,571
As do I.

136
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,878
I <i>can't</i> help it.

137
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,019
Since Lorenzo got sick,

138
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,224
I just worry all the time.

139
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,760
My children have only me to depend upon.

140
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,855
Nancy, you're not alone. You've got
an entire wagon train here with you.

141
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:33,196
Now, the Bishop seems to have
an understanding with the Indians, and...

142
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,463
Well, I believe we're safe here.

143
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,247
<i>It's</i> not the Indians I worry about.

144
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,322
How long will you be gone, Father?

145
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:59,124
Two days. Jonathan, you're the eldest.
You'll be responsible.

146
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,322
Yes, sir.

147
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,990
Are you sure you <i>don't</i> want me
to go with you?

148
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,159
<i>I'm</i> sure.

149
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:07,365
Would you like me to do as you suggested
and check up on the emigrants?

150
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,067
You're awfully eager
to follow my suggestions.

151
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,042
<i>I'd</i> like to get another look at the horses.

152
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,976
Are you sure <i>that's</i> all you want to
get a look at?

153
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,174
Watch them closely.
I want to know what they're up to.

154
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,377
What would you like me to do?

155
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,584
You watch your brother.

156
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,721
- What are you doing?
- Watching you.

157
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,666
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

158
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,174
- You're the <i>Bishop's</i> son.
- Yes, sir, <i>I'm</i> Jonathan.

159
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:22,077
- Beautiful day.
- Yes, sir. Sure.

160
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,547
- Are you out for a morning ride, are you?
- No, sir.

161
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,553
The truth is,
I was admiring your horses yesterday,

162
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:35,753
and I was hoping to get a closer look
at them, if <i>that's</i> okay by you.

163
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,659
Well, <i>let's</i> ride on down
and get you that closer look.

164
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,494
<i>I'm</i> always proud to show off our horses.

165
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,433
- You like horses, do you?
- Yes, sir.

166
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,803
It seems I have a way with them.

167
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,006
- These are all mares?
- Brood mares.

168
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,275
Most of them are due in the spring.

169
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,682
When we get to California,
we should have a fine crop of babies.

170
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:05,280
- I've never seen horses like this before.
- And you probably never will.

171
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,723
These horses are <i>Kentucky's</i> finest.

172
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,624
We plan to start horse racing
when we get to California.

173
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:15,632
Give those miners something to do
besides drinking and whoring.

174
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,441
Why is that horse tied away
from the others?

175
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,670
<i>He's</i> mean, unmanageable,
<i>doesn't</i> like anybody.

176
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,542
I heard he was kept in a stall
for a whole year and never let out

177
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,344
while his owners tried to decide
what to do with him.

178
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:36,581
- Are you planning on racing him?
- No, no, <i>he's</i> unridable.

179
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,957
Then why do you keep him?

180
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,552
For breeding.
He'll make a great sire, one day.

181
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:48,759
<i>He's</i> got the finest bloodlines,
and he runs like the wind.

182
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,174
<i>I'm</i> telling you,

183
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,248
I swear my brother knows
how to talk to horses.

184
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,878
Very impressive.

185
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,325
Ma'am. Begging your pardon.

186
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,693
That was quite impressive, Mr. Samuelson.

187
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:40,600
- Jonathan. My name is Jonathan.
- Emily. <i>I'm</i> Emily.

188
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:45,705
I saw you on the first day.
I was riding in my <i>father's</i> carriage.

189
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,438
I remember.

190
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:52,313
And <i>I'm</i> Micah. Mr. <i>Talkative's</i> brother.

191
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,051
Nice to meet you, Micah.

192
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:01,215
- So, do all animals like you?
- Most, I guess.

193
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,354
Perhaps <i>you'd</i> like to try and ride him?

194
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,568
<i>He's</i> magnificent.

195
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,873
Captain Fancher, why <i>don't</i> you let
Jonathan try to ride him?

196
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,307
I would say <i>that's Jonathan's</i> decision.

197
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:23,074
I'll warn you though,
<i>he's</i> thrown every rider <i>that's</i> tried.

198
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:29,043
- Mr. Samuelson?
- Jonathan. Please, call me Jonathan.

199
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,552
- Jonathan.
- I'll need a corral.

200
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:35,559
A one without corners
so he <i>won't</i> feel confined.

201
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,056
I think we can provide that.

202
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,230
Come back tomorrow in the morning,
you can have a go at him.

203
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:07,851
We are earnestly seeking to expose
the vicious principles of Joseph Smith

204
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:12,225
and those who practice
the same abominations and whoredoms.

205
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,322
Joseph Smith has ordered us
to destroy everything.

206
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,764
He is the voice of God.

207
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:19,530
Burn the papers. Burn the papers.
Burn everything.

208
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,807
We will trample down our enemies

209
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:27,242
and make it one gore of blood from
the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean.

210
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,179
I will be to this generation
a second Mohammed,

211
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:34,378
whose motto in treating for peace
was "The Al-Qur'an or the <i>sword."</i>

212
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:39,355
So shall it eventually be with us,
Joseph Smith or the sword!

213
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:48,198
Burn. Let their lies burn.

214
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,802
Why does Joseph Smith need protection?

215
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:01,072
You're supposed to be a general, or a king?

216
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,637
- I heard you got 40 wives.
- King Smith!

217
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,481
I told you that Joseph Smith meant trouble.

218
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,214
<i>It's</i> probably those Missourians.
They hate him.

219
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:18,656
There must be 100 people down there.
We gotta get back downstairs. You stay put.

220
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,494
We will never leave you or forsake you.

221
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,603
Brother Hyrum!

222
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:41,651
Joseph Smith is dead!
Joseph Smith is dead!

223
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,657
Here he comes.

224
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:33,737
- Mr. Samuelson, good morning.
- Good morning, Captain Fancher.

225
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:39,103
- What have you done to him?
- <i>He's</i> ready to go if you are.

226
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,347
Now, I'll hold him while you mount.

227
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:46,144
You let me know when you're ready,
I'll pull that blindfold.

228
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,913
That <i>won't</i> be necessary.

229
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,801
Okay.

230
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,865
<i>It's</i> okay. <i>It's</i> okay.

231
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:17,607
<i>It's</i> okay. Steady. Easy boy. <i>It's</i> okay.

232
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,250
Okay.

233
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:24,820
Here you go, pal. <i>It's</i> okay. <i>It's</i> okay.

234
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:42,000
Good boy, good boy. <i>That's</i> it. Come on.

235
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,545
You listen to me now.

236
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,365
Now, you're listening to me now.

237
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,984
Come on, good boy. <i>That's</i> it. Come on.

238
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,254
We're gonna be a good team.

239
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,020
I think that boy does speak horse.

240
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:47,167
Good boy. Good boy.

241
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,979
Good boy.

242
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,256
Good boy.

243
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,629
Good morning, Jonathan.

244
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,994
Here we go. <i>I'm</i> gonna get up on you now.

245
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,066
Good boy.

246
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,474
<i>That's</i> it, good boy.

247
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:03,313
Okay, you ready? Here we go.

248
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,376
<i>It's</i> okay. We're still partners.

249
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:11,145
Okay. Here we go.

250
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,986
Good boy.

251
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:25,365
Good boy. There you go.
Hey, we're buddies.

252
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:21,648
Joseph Smith himself ordered
a company of Danites

253
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,753
to put right physically
that which is not right,

254
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:30,665
and to cleanse the Church
of very great evils.

255
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,897
I have no wife whom I love so well

256
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:38,465
that I would not put a javelin
through her heart for lying with my brother,

257
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:41,010
and I would do so with clean hands.

258
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,245
There are sins that men commit

259
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:51,379
for which they cannot attain forgiveness
in this world,

260
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,783
or in that which is to come.

261
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:58,454
And if their eyes were open
to their true condition,

262
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:02,465
they would be perfectly willing
to have their blood spilt upon the ground

263
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,558
<i>to atone for their sins.</i>

264
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:09,038
If there is a person here
that has committed a sin

265
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,077
that he knows will deprive him of that
exaltation which he desires,

266
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:18,548
and he cannot attain to it
without the shedding of his blood

267
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,848
to atone for that sin,
and be saved and exalted with the gods,

268
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,387
they would say,

269
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,754
<i>"Shed my blood that I may be saved

270
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,583
<i>"and exalted with the gods!"</i>

271
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,378
You've done wonders with him.

272
00:30:56,354 --> 00:31:00,256
Good boy. No, he does most of the work.
I just hang on.

273
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,054
You two look like
you've been together forever.

274
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,524
You have a beautiful baby.

275
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,936
Thank you, but she <i>isn't</i> mine.

276
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,097
Her mother died at childbirth.

277
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,234
So, <i>I'm</i> just helping the other women
and Robert take care of her.

278
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,811
And <i>she's</i> doing a wonderful job of it.

279
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,642
I <i>couldn't</i> survive without her.

280
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:33,784
Can you believe what Jonathan has been
able to do with the stallion?

281
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,017
<i>It's</i> impressive.

282
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,785
But <i>I'd</i> like to see what happens when

283
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,298
you take him outside
the confines of this little corral.

284
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,390
President Buchanan has sent
thousands of troops

285
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:18,799
which are on their way here
to kill all the Indians and all the Mormons.

286
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,837
- <i>It's</i> outrageous.
- Outrageous.

287
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,272
President Buchanan means
to remove me as Governor

288
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,434
and give the kingdom to the Mericats.

289
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,674
I will try to take care of number one,

290
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,378
and if it is wicked for me
to try to preserve myself,

291
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:40,355
I shall persist in it,
for I am intending to take care of myself.

292
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,090
Hell cannot remove me.

293
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,661
- Amen.
- Amen.

294
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,458
- I am still your Governor.
- Glory to God!

295
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:53,265
I will still rule this people until God himself
permits another to take my place.

296
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:54,861
Hallelujah!

297
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,373
<i>I'm</i> declaring martial law.

298
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:01,309
We will not be run out.
This time, we will stand and fight.

299
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,874
I am the voice of God,

300
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,117
and anyone who <i>doesn't</i> like it
will be hewn down.

301
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,819
God has revealed to me

302
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,395
that I have the right and the power

303
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:22,432
to call down curses on anyone
who tries to invade our lands.

304
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:27,937
- Therefore, I curse the Gentiles.
- Amen.

305
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:33,569
You like him?

306
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,307
<i>He's</i> a beautiful horse.
With the right handling,

307
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:38,507
he'll be a great horse.

308
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:42,780
<i>I'm</i> glad you think so,
because <i>he's</i> yours to keep.

309
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,657
I <i>can't</i> accept such a gift.

310
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,285
Boy, that horse belongs to you.

311
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:54,627
He was yours the moment you laid eyes
on each other.

312
00:33:54,899 --> 00:34:00,303
And it <i>wouldn't</i> be fair for me to stop
love at first sight, now would it?

313
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,768
Thank you, sir. You're very generous.

314
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,435
No more generous than your father
has been to us.

315
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,438
Thank you, sir.

316
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:14,109
- Thank you very much.
- You're most welcome.

317
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,886
I <i>don't</i> know how to accept such a fine gift.

318
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,019
Well, I think, as the Captain said,

319
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,428
I think he was yours the moment
you laid eyes on each other.

320
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,194
Love at first sight.

321
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,500
Do you believe in that?

322
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,737
I <i>don't</i> know.

323
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,601
It happened to my parents.

324
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:45,010
My mother always likes to say it was
<i>God's</i> plan for their lives,

325
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:51,180
that it was their destiny to be together.
Do you believe in destiny?

326
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,748
You're different. I mean,
I've never met anyone like you before.

327
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,725
You haven't?

328
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,130
A lot of people say <i>it's</i> because
<i>I'm</i> a <i>pastor's</i> daughter,

329
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:05,258
which... I really <i>don't</i> like it.
It makes me feel like a misfit.

330
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,895
I've never really been around
Gentiles before.

331
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:12,806
Gentiles? What do you mean by that?
You're not Jewish.

332
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,179
<i>It's</i> just what we call you people.

333
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,010
You people?
What do you mean by you people?

334
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:24,381
<i>It's</i> just a manner of speaking.

335
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:29,756
You know, different parts of the country
have different ways of saying things.

336
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,328
You know?

337
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,490
I suppose, Biblically speaking,
you're correct.

338
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,658
But then that would make you a Gentile, too.

339
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:40,635
Actually, I like that you're different
from the other girls around here.

340
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,335
How am I different?

341
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,272
Well,

342
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:54,142
for a start, you're the prettiest girl
I've ever seen.

343
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,758
Well, I like that.

344
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,349
And you speak your mind.

345
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,827
You're not afraid to tell people
what you think.

346
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,694
Why is that different? A lot of the women
around here speak their mind.

347
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:12,860
I mean, look at Nancy.
<i>She's</i> much more outspoken than I am.

348
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,666
You mean the woman who wears the pants
and carries the gun?

349
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:19,937
- Yes.
- My father thinks <i>she's</i> an abomination.

350
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,042
Does he?

351
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:25,877
<i>He's</i> not different from
the rest of the men around here.

352
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:32,218
And I <i>don't</i> see other women in the
wagon train wearing pants or carrying guns.

353
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,813
I mean, so what do they think about her?

354
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,826
<i>It's</i> a free country.
She can do what she pleases.

355
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,523
Why would your father care about
something like that?

356
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,758
What difference does it make to him?

357
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,562
<i>It's</i> just the way he is.

358
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,762
A lot of things bother him.

359
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,712
<i>"Why look at the mote in your brother's</i> eye
when there is a beam in <i>yours?"</i>

360
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:03,253
- What?
- Jesus said that in Matthew.

361
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,181
It sounds as though your father is always

362
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,225
looking for the motes
in other <i>people's</i> eyes.

363
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:16,858
<i>He's</i> the Bishop. I mean, <i>it's</i> his job.
He has to keep people in line.

364
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,067
What does your father do?

365
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:25,074
My father says,
<i>"Judge not, lest ye be judged."</i>

366
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,211
Jesus said that, too.

367
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,083
How does he keep control?
How does he punish the sinners?

368
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:39,487
He <i>doesn't</i> punish sinners.
Their sins are between them and God.

369
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,394
Will I see you again?

370
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,761
Even if the sun <i>doesn't</i> rise.

371
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:09,775
A wagon train from Missouri and Arkansas
is camped at the Mountain Meadows.

372
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,447
They have 500 head of prize beef,

373
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,787
a choice herd of Kentucky racehorses,
Kentucky muzzleloaders,

374
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,123
a large stockpile of ammunition

375
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:22,598
and a well-guarded wagon
with a trunk that is said to be full of gold.

376
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,361
I hear some of them are Missouri wildcats

377
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,668
who brag about killing Joseph Smith

378
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,608
and carry the very gun that killed him.

379
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:39,149
They say that they will join the army
and kill Brigham Young, all the apostles,

380
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,515
and every damned Mormon man,
woman and child.

381
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,249
They have no pass
to go through our country.

382
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,953
No man has the right to go through
our lands without a pass.

383
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:55,127
They could be killed as common enemies.

384
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,133
The Paiutes and the brethren
must stick together

385
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,999
for the Mericats plan to kill us all.

386
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,437
We have led the Mericats
to the Mountain Meadows.

387
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,874
<i>It's</i> the perfect place for an ambush
and a siege.

388
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:10,845
A crown of celestial glory and eternal joy

389
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:14,645
is the reward of those who are faithful
and willingly obey.

390
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:19,582
We are gathered here to build up
the kingdom of God.

391
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:25,424
It exalts God that he has planted this people
in a place <i>that's</i> not desired by the wicked.

392
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,391
Until this moment,
I have protected emigrants

393
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,730
who have passed through this territory,

394
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,497
but now...

395
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:36,334
Now I will loose the Indians upon them!

396
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:42,208
And if any miserable scoundrel
comes here to our Zion, cut his throat.

397
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,813
We take a solemn oath to never discuss this,

398
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,681
even among ourselves,

399
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:54,780
and promise to keep the whole matter secret
from every human being.

400
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,493
- Amen.
- Amen.

401
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:03,927
<i>"Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous.

402
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:08,471
<i>"Praise is comely for the upright.
Praise the Lord with <i>heart."</i>

403
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,572
You should be careful, Emily.

404
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,148
These people are different.

405
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,878
I find him interesting.

406
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,588
I know.

407
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,285
- Where are you going?
- To the river to bathe.

408
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:34,421
- Is that safe?
- Safer then one more day with the smell.

409
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,227
Good night.

410
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,699
Emily.

411
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,671
No good will come of this.

412
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,574
Seems like a lot of people
have opinions about things

413
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,080
which are none of their business, Robert.

414
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:56,847
We're leaving in a week
and your heart will still be here.

415
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,281
Well, maybe I will stay with my heart.

416
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,487
And be one of his many wives?

417
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,328
At least you'll have help with the dishes.

418
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:36,890
Easy, boy. What is it? What are you seeing?

419
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,529
Something out there?

420
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:55,302
- What are you doing here?
- Spying on you.

421
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:57,440
Boy, can he run!

422
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,442
I've got <i>Father's</i> best horse here
and he <i>can't</i> even keep up.

423
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:02,205
Promise me you'll let him
sire some stock for me.

424
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,440
Why are you spying on me?

425
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:08,280
Well, Father is a little worried about you.

426
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,649
He thinks you're getting a little too friendly
with the Gentiles.

427
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,483
And what do you think?

428
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:17,325
- You need a wife.
- <i>I'm</i> getting tired of hearing that.

429
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:21,995
Let me tell you, <i>there's</i> nothing like
a soft body to cuddle up with at night.

430
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,657
I <i>don't</i> want to hear about that.

431
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,235
- You like that Gentile girl?
- Why?

432
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,864
She sure is pretty. You think she'll convert?

433
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:34,567
- Maybe I will.
- Now you're just being stupid.

434
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:38,939
You're the man.
<i>She's</i> the one who needs to convert.

435
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:41,910
Micah, do you love your wives?

436
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,889
I <i>don't</i> know. I mean, <i>what's</i> love?

437
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,985
Maybe men <i>don't</i> fall in love,
only women do.

438
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,823
- You ever thought about that?
- No.

439
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,758
You need a wife.

440
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,444
- Here you go.
- Where are you going?

441
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:16,041
Home, to bed, with my wives.

442
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:19,049
Well, be careful
you <i>don't</i> go falling in love, okay?

443
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,783
<i>It's</i> okay. At least <i>I'm</i> married.

444
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,655
Oh, you want me to put your horse away
for you?

445
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:29,426
No, I'll do it.
I want to talk to father when he gets home.

446
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,986
Fine-looking horse.

447
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,492
Yes, he is, Father.

448
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,859
Where did he come from?

449
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:10,702
He was a gift to me.

450
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,269
Who would give you such a fine gift
and why?

451
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:21,316
Well, the truth is,
no one else could go near him.

452
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,554
So they gave him to me.

453
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:29,250
He'll make a great sire.

454
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,260
He'll definitely improve
the quality of our stock.

455
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:35,422
- Yes.
- <i>What's</i> happening with the emigrants?

456
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:38,126
When do they plan to move out?

457
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:41,962
I think they plan to stay the two weeks
that you gave them.

458
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,200
Have they said anything about
the <i>Prophet's</i> murder?

459
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:51,247
I <i>don't</i> think they even know
who Joseph Smith was.

460
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:56,182
Have you heard them talk about joining
<i>Buchanan's</i> army, running us out of here?

461
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,551
All they want to do is go to California.

462
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:04,351
I think you've got them figured wrong.
They mean no harm.

463
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:09,655
Some of them are from Missouri.
<i>Can't</i> trust anyone from Missouri.

464
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:14,236
<i>That's</i> like saying every Mormon
is perfect and can do no wrong.

465
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:20,268
You're not getting attached
to the emigrants, are you?

466
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:22,038
What do you mean?

467
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:28,644
I notice those emigrant girls
had an eye for you.

468
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:32,288
I've been thinking,
the Taylor girl is awful pretty.

469
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:36,018
- <i>It's</i> time you took a wife.
- I <i>don't</i> want one right now.

470
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,218
Gwen Taylor is sweet on Donald.

471
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:43,356
<i>I'm</i> the Bishop around here.
You can have any girl you want as a wife.

472
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:47,464
<i>I'm</i> not interested in her, Father.

473
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,966
I <i>don't</i> want someone to marry me
just because you're the Bishop.

474
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:52,371
Why not?

475
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:58,280
You have your <i>mother's</i> looks, my position.

476
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,408
Any girl would be proud to be sealed to you.

477
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:06,986
She was beautiful.

478
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:12,089
At least, <i>that's</i> how I remember her.

479
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,889
Is that how you remember her?

480
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:24,567
She was considered the most beautiful
woman in these parts.

481
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,075
What happened to my mother?

482
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,081
After all these years, what does it matter?

483
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,616
It matters to me.

484
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:37,915
The Apostle took her away.
I want to know why.

485
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,353
He had a revelation that she was
supposed to be his wife.

486
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,516
And you believed him?

487
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:46,387
She already had a family and a husband.

488
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,828
She was sealed to you in the Church.

489
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:51,628
As the Apostle Heber says,
<i>"Learn to do as you are told.

490
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:55,330
<i>"If you are told by your leaders
to do a thing, do it.

491
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,430
<i>"It's</i> none of your business
whether it be right or <i>wrong."</i>

492
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,339
<i>It's</i> wrong to take a mother
from her children,

493
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,912
a wife from her husband.

494
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,516
No one can do that.

495
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,810
There are many things
that we <i>don't</i> understand,

496
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,253
because we <i>don't</i> have
direct revelations from God.

497
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,859
You <i>didn't</i> even argue with him, did you?

498
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:21,488
He was one of the Apostles.
I had no right to argue with him.

499
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,591
She knew.

500
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:31,698
She saw through the lie
and came back for us.

501
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:37,476
- Jonathan.
- She was willing to die for us.

502
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,221
You were there.

503
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:47,517
What are you talking about?

504
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,787
You were there when she died.

505
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:54,922
You <i>don't</i> understand. I loved her.

506
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:58,900
When I die, her secret name
will be the first name I'll call.

507
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:01,664
I will make her celestial goddess
of my planet.

508
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:06,402
You loved her but you let the Apostle
take her away and kill her.

509
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,068
I had no choice.

510
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,840
You're responsible for her death!

511
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:20,021
Jonathan! Jonathan! Stop!
Stop, Jonathan! You'll kill him!

512
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,251
- Just like he killed my mother!
- He <i>didn't</i> kill her!

513
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,420
- He was there!
- He <i>didn't</i> kill her!

514
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:30,256
- I saw him there.
- He <i>didn't</i> kill her.

515
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,201
The Danites killed her
and the Apostle made him watch.

516
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:37,836
My mother said he cried for months.

517
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:50,815
I would die for the woman I loved
before I saw her murdered.

518
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,135
Get up!

519
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:13,971
Get up.

520
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:17,977
What for?

521
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,174
You're going to the temple
for your endowments.

522
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,250
But...

523
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,187
I <i>haven't</i> taken the test.
How can I get a recommend?

524
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,757
<i>I'm</i> the Bishop.
I decide what you do and when you do it.

525
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:33,228
You're temple-worthy, and you're going to
the temple whether you like it or not.

526
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,628
Your brothers will escort you.

527
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:43,934
<i>Don't</i> argue, Jonathan. Just do it.

528
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:13,029
Everyone who passes through
their endowment in the Temple

529
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:17,766
are placed under the most sacred obligation
to avenge the blood of the Prophet

530
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,172
whenever an opportunity arises.

531
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:23,905
You must teach your children
to do the same.

532
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:28,713
The entire Mormon people are sworn and
avowed enemies of the American nation.

533
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:32,186
The blood of Christ will never wipe that out.

534
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:36,650
Your own blood must atone for it,
and the judgments of the Almighty

535
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,198
will come, sooner or later,
and every man or woman will have to atone

536
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,097
for breaking their covenant.

537
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:49,901
<i>"We and each of us covenant and promise

538
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:53,772
<i>"that we will not reveal
any of the secrets of this,

539
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:57,643
<i>"the second token of Aaronic priesthood

540
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:02,275
<i>"with its accompanying name,
sign or penalty.

541
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:07,254
<i>"Should we do so,
we agree to have our breasts cut open

542
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:11,691
<i>"and our hearts and vitals
torn out from our bodies

543
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:16,391
<i>"and given to the birds of the air
and the beasts of the <i>field."</i>

544
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:21,985
Hold me. <i>Don't</i> ever let me go.

545
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,118
I won't, I promise.

546
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:28,995
I <i>didn't</i> think you were coming.

547
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,596
I will always come back for you.

548
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:36,803
Nothing, nobody will ever keep
anything between us.

549
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,267
I have never met anyone like you.

550
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,980
I've never met anyone like you.

551
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:50,819
I've loved you since the first moment
I saw your beautiful face.

552
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:59,360
We <i>don't</i> even know each other.
Do you think it can happen so fast?

553
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,291
Love at first sight.

554
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:08,503
<i>It's</i> only a matter of minutes,
or maybe seconds.

555
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,967
- And it lasts forever.
- Forever.

556
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:25,514
Jonathan, does your father have more
than one wife?

557
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:31,818
Yes. He has 18.

558
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:36,864
Eighteen? How can a man
have so many wives?

559
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:41,835
Well, the Prophet, Brigham Young,
he has 27.

560
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:46,842
Well, how many wives will you have?

561
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:52,611
Well, if I married someone like you,

562
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,481
why would I want to marry anybody else?

563
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:27,674
Captain Fancher! Oh, dear God, no.

564
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,411
God, no!

565
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:33,179
- We found her in the river.
- Captain Fancher!

566
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:35,056
Oh, God.

567
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:38,589
<i>Don't</i> let the children see this.
What happened?

568
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:41,789
We <i>don't</i> know.
We found her floating in the river.

569
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,628
- What were you doing down at the river?
- I just went there to bathe.

570
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,723
And what were you doing there?

571
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:48,030
Emily, you need to be
with <i>Nancy's</i> children now.

572
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,766
- But...
- Emily, they're alone now.

573
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,973
- Where are you going?
- To help...

574
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,514
I <i>don't</i> think <i>that's</i> a good idea
right now, son.

575
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:03,575
You're not one of us. You <i>don't</i> belong here.

576
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:07,315
Best be on your way.
Let us take care of our own.

577
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:10,725
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

578
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,158
<i>I'm</i> very sorry.

579
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:50,095
In these perilous times, <i>it's</i> important
to remember <i>God's</i> commandment

580
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,033
to love even those who hate us.

581
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:57,568
<i>"Thou hast commanded us
to keep thy precepts diligently.

582
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:00,802
<i>"O that my ways were directed
to keep thy <i>statutes!"</i>

583
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,504
<i>"Thou hast rebuked
the proud that are cursed,

584
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,446
<i>"which do err from thy commandments."</i>

585
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:08,710
<i>"I've</i> chosen the way of <i>truth."</i>

586
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:22,887
Jonathan.

587
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,328
Jonathan, wake up.

588
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,109
You're still here.

589
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,410
I <i>couldn't</i> leave.

590
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:45,143
We're leaving soon.

591
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:49,385
And Captain Fancher wants us gone
by first light.

592
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,226
First light?

593
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,321
Yes.

594
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,893
<i>Nancy's</i> death has made us all very nervous.

595
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,991
Then <i>I'm</i> going with you.

596
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,897
- To California?
- Yes, to California.

597
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:09,439
You would leave everything
and just come with me to California?

598
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:10,977
Yes.

599
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:16,050
Because I love you
and I want you to marry me.

600
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:19,583
You do?

601
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,557
I would give up my life for you.

602
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,763
This is my pledge to marry you.

603
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:47,105
And this represents
my commitment to leave.

604
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:04,793
<i>She's</i> beautiful.

605
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,128
She was my mother.

606
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:11,973
She would have loved you.

607
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:28,756
I have to get back before they miss me.

608
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:32,589
I'll slip out early
and I'll be back by first light.

609
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:35,230
- All right.
- I promise.

610
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:02,491
I've asked for this special meeting
of the Saints

611
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:07,655
because we're about to embark
on one of our greatest missions.

612
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,264
Not even your closest wives must know.

613
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:15,234
You all agree to a vow of secrecy?

614
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,737
- Yes.
- Yes.

615
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:20,332
The Gentiles have once again
invaded our land.

616
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,639
I had a vision.

617
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,413
- I had a vision.
- <i>What's</i> going on?

618
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,108
Where were you?

619
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:35,623
The Prophet Joseph Smith
came to me last night and he said,

620
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:41,990
<i>"How long will you let the Gentiles
continue to drive us <i>away?"</i>

621
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:45,932
And I <i>couldn't</i> answer him.
I <i>couldn't</i> answer him.

622
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:51,606
Then Joseph Smith whispered that God
has decreed these Gentiles are cursed.

623
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,874
And that they will murder
every Mormon man, woman and child.

624
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:56,808
- Never! Never!
- Wait!

625
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,210
- Stop it!
- Wait, let me speak!

626
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,145
Mormon Saints,
do you remember the Mormon War?

627
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:01,614
Yes!

628
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:03,919
They ran us out of Missouri!

629
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:07,478
Are we going to wait for them to burn
our houses and slaughter us again?

630
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,888
No! No! No!

631
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:13,359
- These Gentiles must die!
- Yes! Die!

632
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,864
<i>It's</i> not true! <i>It's</i> not true!

633
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:18,228
I've been among them.

634
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:20,996
Upon your order, I've spied on them.

635
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:24,369
I <i>didn't</i> see or hear anything
to support what you're saying.

636
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,339
Have you forgotten your pledge

637
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:29,002
to obey the Prophet and the Apostles
without question?

638
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,808
The Prophet and his Apostles sent word

639
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,246
that they were each given
the same revelation from God.

640
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,544
Joseph Smith said,

641
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:39,985
<i>"As Aaron was chosen by Jehovah
to speak for Jehovah to Israel,

642
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:46,187
<i>"so Jehovah created me, Joseph Smith,
to be your God on <i>Earth."</i>

643
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:47,353
Hallelujah!

644
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,954
<i>"The Apostles were chosen
to be my <i>mouth."</i>

645
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:51,055
Hallelujah!

646
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:55,536
To question the Prophet and the Apostles
is to question Jehovah himself!

647
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:58,630
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

648
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:04,311
We, we have been honored

649
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:08,811
above all other men
to be the chosen instruments of death

650
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:12,410
in carrying out this merciful deed.
It is our sacred duty!

651
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:17,186
Through their deaths,
these Gentiles will obtain eternal salvation.

652
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:23,425
We are to consider their deaths
a virtuous act of grace and mercy.

653
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:25,925
Brethren, we have a duty to perform.

654
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:29,436
It is a duty we owe to God
and to our Church.

655
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:35,068
The orders of those in authority
are that all the emigrants must die.

656
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,408
Amen! Amen!

657
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:40,472
Our leaders speak with inspired tongues,

658
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,950
and their orders come
from the God of Heaven.

659
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:46,783
We have no right to question
what they have commanded us to do.

660
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,050
It is our duty to obey.

661
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,150
And what of the laws of our land?

662
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,855
Do we disobey the laws of our country?

663
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:59,628
Whether we like it or not,
we're still part of the United States.

664
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:02,169
How dare you question
the voice of the Heavenly Father?

665
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,705
I do not question the Heavenly Father,

666
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:09,301
I question what the Prophet
and the Apostles think they heard.

667
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:12,677
Is it not possible
that Satan has deceived us all?

668
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,675
The Prophet and the Apostles
never make mistakes!

669
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:18,481
They're called
by the Heavenly Father himself!

670
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:21,352
Although you are my son,
I warn you, beware.

671
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:26,588
Lest Joseph Smith and Jehovah demand
your blood as atonement for your sins.

672
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,130
- You know the penalties for disobedience.
- Amen!

673
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:32,292
The Prophet decrees
a crown of celestial glory for all

674
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:34,961
who are faithful and willingly obey.

675
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,629
Hallelujah!

676
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:38,730
- Blood atonement!
- Blood atonement!

677
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:42,641
Blood atonement! Blood atonement!
Blood atonement!

678
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:45,839
Blood atonement! Blood atonement!
Blood atonement!

679
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,439
- Have you all gone mad?
- Blood atonement!

680
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:51,418
Traitor! Arrest him! Arrest him!

681
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,521
Tie him up!
Make sure he <i>can't</i> warn the emigrants!

682
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,260
For the love of God!

683
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:05,095
We praise you, Joseph Smith,

684
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:08,534
and vow to avenge your blood
and the blood of all the other Saints

685
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:10,162
murdered by these wicked people!

686
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:14,432
<i>Blood atonement! Blood atonement!</i>
<i>Blood atonement!</i>

687
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,424
Father, please.

688
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:33,822
You <i>can't</i> do this.

689
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,864
Try to understand.

690
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:41,665
Before Joseph Smith picked me off
the streets, I had no future.

691
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:46,473
He changed all that, made me a bishop.
I have more than I ever dreamed of,

692
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:49,271
money, respect, beautiful wives.

693
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:54,441
I owe everything to him.
He believed in me before anyone else did.

694
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,040
Do you understand how much
that meant to me?

695
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,780
For the first time, I understood

696
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:01,288
that I had it in me
to become a god someday.

697
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:04,154
I was no longer a failure.
There is greatness in me.

698
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:08,128
And so you choose
to kill innocent women and children?

699
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:11,056
They're not innocent.

700
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:15,164
Yes, they are, Father.

701
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:19,466
Like lambs to the slaughter.

702
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:24,144
They murdered Mormon children
in Missouri.

703
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:28,408
God demands their blood spill
on the earth to atone for sins

704
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,451
that can never be wiped away
by <i>Christ's</i> blood.

705
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:33,215
We're saving their eternal lives,

706
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:37,053
giving them a chance
to get into one of the heavens.

707
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,320
And you really believe that?

708
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:44,661
How can you all blindly honor and obey
as a god on earth

709
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:48,799
a man who went to school for two months?

710
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:55,674
Brigham Young is an uneducated madman.

711
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:02,044
Please.

712
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,442
No, please!

713
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:08,880
So you think <i>he's</i> God on Earth?

714
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:13,691
Well, if he is, let him hear me now!

715
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:16,389
<i>He's</i> a crazy tyrant!

716
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:04,094
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom in the last days.

717
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:05,696
God will bless you.

718
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:09,005
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom in the last days.

719
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:12,808
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

720
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:15,016
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

721
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:17,847
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom.

722
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,945
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

723
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,351
God will bless you.

724
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:25,086
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom in the last days.

725
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:28,425
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom.

726
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:32,131
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom.</i>

727
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,498
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

728
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:36,764
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom.

729
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,931
<i>God will bless you.</i>

730
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:42,272
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

731
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:44,539
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom.</i>

732
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:46,114
<i>God will bless you.</i>

733
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:48,012
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom.

734
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:49,641
God will bless you.

735
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:53,313
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

736
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,615
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

737
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:57,055
<i>God will bless you.</i>

738
01:09:57,159 --> 01:10:00,560
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

739
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:02,756
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom.</i>

740
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,298
<i>God will bless you.</i>

741
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,067
Indians!

742
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:12,931
<i>It's</i> Indians!

743
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,443
Come on, <i>let's</i> go!

744
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,070
Ready arms!

745
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,377
Draw those knives!

746
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:57,009
Help!

747
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:58,581
Help them load!

748
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:12,798
Powder!

749
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,028
Rob, behind you!

750
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:20,500
Now, get over there. Get out!

751
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:37,720
No!

752
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:45,756
Now, now!

753
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,700
Look out!

754
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,133
We're out of ammo!

755
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,550
Get down, now!

756
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,003
Stay down!

757
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,944
- He said <i>he'd</i> come back.
- Who?

758
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,344
Jonathan. He said <i>he'd</i> come back.

759
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:47,513
<i>I'm</i> sure he tried.
Maybe he <i>can't</i> get through.

760
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:51,656
He asked...

761
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:56,888
He asked me to marry him.

762
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,692
And he said he wanted to come
with me to California.

763
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:05,306
So we exchanged
our most precious possession.

764
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:12,211
I gave him my cross. Are you angry?

765
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:17,814
I could never be angry with you,
no matter what.

766
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:25,857
If we get out of this, will you marry us?

767
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,963
I would be proud to marry you.

768
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:33,365
It has always been my dream to do so.

769
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:39,206
Pray for him.

770
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,404
I love him so much.

771
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:53,487
I volunteered to ride
to the Mormons for help.

772
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:55,489
It would give me great peace of mind

773
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:58,560
if you would look after my daughter
while <i>I'm</i> gone.

774
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,718
<i>Isn't</i> there anyone else?

775
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,626
You should be here with your baby
at a time like this.

776
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:06,997
<i>I'm</i> the best rider we got.
We have the best chance if I am riding.

777
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:11,600
I will look after her
as though she were my own.

778
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,581
Return safely, Robert.

779
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:41,432
<i>Let's</i> go.

780
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:08,089
<i>It's</i> been four days.
I <i>don't</i> know how long we can hold out.

781
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:12,633
Our <i>food's</i> low, we have no water.

782
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:18,863
They know we'll die without water.
All they have to do is wait.

783
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:22,337
Our ammunition is almost gone.

784
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:29,016
Captain Baker is dead. <i>I'm</i> the only leader,
and, God help me, I <i>don't</i> know what to do.

785
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:35,455
We can pray.

786
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,628
We can all pray together.

787
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:46,461
<i>"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

788
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:51,330
<i>"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

789
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,807
<i>"He leadeth me beside the still waters.

790
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,572
<i>"He restoreth my soul.

791
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:02,048
<i>"He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his <i>name's</i> sake.

792
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:05,415
<i>"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

793
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,048
<i>"I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

794
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:13,958
<i>"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

795
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:19,125
<i>"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

796
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:24,200
<i>"Thou anointest my head with oil,
my cup runneth over.

797
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:30,004
<i>"Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life,

798
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:34,048
<i>"and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord <i>forever."</i>

799
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,014
- Amen.
- Amen.

800
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:52,265
These are your orders
from President Haight.

801
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:53,925
It has been sent by the Council at Cedar City

802
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:57,233
and it has been approved
by all highest authorities.

803
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,083
Sir?

804
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,347
I cannot do this.

805
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,356
President Haight has counseled
with Colonel Dame

806
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:21,521
and has orders from him to put
all of the emigrants out of the way.

807
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:24,827
None who are old enough to talk
are to be spared.

808
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:29,902
Brethren.

809
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:38,108
The entire camp are cut-throats,
robbers and assassins.

810
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,807
They are a part of the people
who drove the Saints from Missouri,

811
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:44,943
and who helped shed the blood
of our prophets, Joseph and Hyrum.

812
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:49,990
It is our orders from all in authority
to get the emigrants from their stronghold.

813
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:54,985
Brother Lee, the brethren in the priesthood
are united in this.

814
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:58,066
It would not go well with you
to oppose them.

815
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:03,370
Let us pray on this matter again.

816
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:20,586
Brethren, I have the evidence
of <i>God's</i> approval of our mission.

817
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,985
It is <i>God's</i> will that we carry out
our instructions to the letter.

818
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,322
Amen.

819
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:59,483
Micah? Thank God.

820
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,328
Micah!

821
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:37,788
Micah!

822
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:43,270
Micah!

823
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:49,709
Jonathan. Jonathan. Help me.

824
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:52,075
Get me out of here. I <i>can't</i> help you in here.

825
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,876
- I <i>can't</i> do it anymore.
- Do what?

826
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:59,552
Oh, my God, <i>what's</i> happening?

827
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:02,248
Micah, <i>what's</i> happening?

828
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:08,822
The Indians and the wagon train.

829
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:12,526
<i>It's</i> awful. <i>It's</i> awful.

830
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:15,667
I <i>can't</i> make any sense of it.

831
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:23,044
Micah, you tell me
<i>what's</i> happening at the wagon train,

832
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:25,942
or so help me, I will cut your throat!

833
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:30,608
Yes, of course. Blood atonement.

834
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:33,944
You, too?

835
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,718
I thought you were the innocent one.

836
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:40,454
Tell me, please.

837
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:49,198
We attacked. <i>It's</i> started.

838
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:54,305
- Get me out of here. Please.
- <i>It's</i> too late.

839
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,437
<i>It's</i> too late. <i>It's</i> started. <i>It's</i> too late for me.
<i>It's</i> too late for everybody.

840
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:01,106
- <i>It's</i> started. <i>It's</i> too late.
- Micah!

841
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:03,414
Micah!

842
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:05,783
Micah!

843
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:12,121
Use this on the chain, and free yourself.

844
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:18,657
And when you get free, Jonathan,
you run as far and as fast as you can.

845
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:23,500
Do not come back and do not look back.
Save yourself from this while you still can.

846
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,039
No, I have to go to her. I have to.

847
01:22:26,141 --> 01:22:31,306
There'll be nothing left to go to, Jonathan.
You run. Run.

848
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:36,982
Micah.

849
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:39,076
Goodbye, my brother.

850
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,113
No.

851
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,720
No, Micah, don't.

852
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:47,254
<i>I'm</i> going to follow the brethren

853
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:50,593
and do my duty to the Mormon god,
Brigham Young.

854
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:55,459
Micah. Micah! Micah!

855
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:23,024
- I <i>didn't</i> see it.
- What?

856
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:26,026
I <i>didn't</i> see the sun rise.

857
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:34,038
They're coming! Get ready!

858
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:43,076
Hold your fire!

859
01:23:45,987 --> 01:23:49,548
Thank God. <i>It's</i> the Mormons!

860
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:24,150
<i>I'm</i> John D. Lee,
Indian Commissioner for this district.

861
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:26,784
We've got the Indians under control.

862
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:29,793
Come with us, and you'll be safe.

863
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:33,129
Thank God. They've been at us for days.

864
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:34,792
I <i>don't</i> think
we could have lasted much longer.

865
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:38,464
Most of the Indians trust us. We have
an agreement worked out with them.

866
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:41,371
But we must move quickly before
the dissenters convince the others

867
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:43,103
to attack again.

868
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:48,081
<i>Don't</i> worry, we've dealt with them before.

869
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:49,741
What should we do?

870
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:54,720
We must take all the weapons, all your guns,
and put them in one of the wagons.

871
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:58,055
Why should we give up our guns?

872
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:01,424
We have to give the appearance of peace.
No weapons.

873
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:03,759
I <i>don't</i> like us giving up our guns.
<i>We'd</i> be defenseless.

874
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:08,562
Sir, we know these savages.
They know that we are a militia.

875
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:11,701
We have to convince them
that you are in our custody.

876
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:14,934
Giving up our weapons
<i>doesn't</i> make much sense.

877
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:19,445
Nothing we have to do in order to
appease the Indians makes much sense, sir.

878
01:25:19,547 --> 01:25:20,980
Trust me.

879
01:25:22,016 --> 01:25:26,316
<i>Don't</i> worry,
we will transport you to Cedar City in safety.

880
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,720
Once there, you will be cared for

881
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:34,022
until the opportunity comes for you
to be taken to California.

882
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:38,361
I <i>don't</i> know about the others,
but I've got a bad feeling about this.

883
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:44,299
We're out of water.

884
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:47,404
We're almost out of food,

885
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:51,206
and the guns will do us no good
without ammunition.

886
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:07,728
All right.

887
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:11,560
Put all children, eight years old
and younger, into the other wagon.

888
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,635
- <i>I'm</i> not giving you my child.
- Neither am I.

889
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:19,238
Do you want to save your babies?
Then put them into that wagon.

890
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,101
There'll be armed guards all around.

891
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:25,577
Your babies will be protected better
than your gold.

892
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:35,987
- Take good care of him, Reverend.
- I will.

893
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:45,460
Please comfort her, Reverend.
<i>She's</i> so afraid.

894
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:49,128
I will take care of them all
as if they were my own Emily.

895
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:58,474
- Take care of them, will you?
- I will.

896
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:36,676
<i>This is loving our neighbor as ourselves.</i>

897
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:38,843
<i>If he needs help, help him.</i>

898
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:41,818
<i>If he wishes salvation,</i>

899
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:47,122
<i>and it is necessary to spill his blood</i>
<i>upon the ground in order that he be saved,</i>

900
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:48,593
<i>spill it.</i>

901
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:52,223
<i>Will you love</i>
<i>your brothers and sisters likewise,</i>

902
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:55,234
<i>when they have committed a sin</i>
<i>that cannot be atoned for</i>

903
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:57,668
<i>without the shedding of their blood?</i>

904
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:00,900
<i>Will you love that man or woman</i>
<i>well enough to shed their blood?</i>

905
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:03,034
<i>That is what Jesus Christ meant.</i>

906
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:07,911
<i>He never told a man or woman</i>
<i>to love their enemies in their wickedness.</i>

907
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:10,541
<i>He never intended any such thing.</i>

908
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:13,348
<i>I could refer you to plenty of instances</i>

909
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:18,289
<i>where men have been righteously slain</i>
<i>in order to atone for their sins.</i>

910
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,249
Oh, my God.

911
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:44,582
No.

912
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:30,119
Halt!

913
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:37,298
Wait.

914
01:30:50,678 --> 01:30:56,139
Mormons! Do your duty!

915
01:31:21,108 --> 01:31:23,804
- Have mercy!
- I do this out of duty.

916
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:53,068
May God forgive you.

917
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,875
<i>Oh, Lord, my God, receive their spirits.</i>

918
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:06,954
<i>We were not to spill</i>
<i>the blood of the innocent!</i>

919
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:10,046
<i>I shot her before I realized she had a baby.</i>

920
01:33:37,178 --> 01:33:40,011
Micah! Micah! Enough.

921
01:33:42,984 --> 01:33:44,542
The <i>boy's</i> dead.

922
01:33:46,587 --> 01:33:49,818
- Are you sure?
- Go, do your duty for Jehovah.

923
01:37:02,116 --> 01:37:03,549
Micah?

924
01:37:14,628 --> 01:37:15,993
Micah?

925
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:19,991
Follow the brethren. Do my duty.

926
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,465
Micah.

927
01:37:22,736 --> 01:37:25,364
Micah, <i>where's</i> Jonathan?

928
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:29,137
Jonathan.

929
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:31,605
<i>He's</i> free.

930
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:35,039
<i>He's</i> innocent.

931
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:41,586
Micah.

932
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:48,321
Why are you here?

933
01:37:52,933 --> 01:37:56,664
You <i>shouldn't</i> be here.
I told you to stay out of this!

934
01:37:57,705 --> 01:37:59,673
- I told you to leave!
- Jonathan!

935
01:37:59,773 --> 01:38:01,434
- Micah, give me the gun.
- No.

936
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:03,567
No, I cannot do that!

937
01:38:04,445 --> 01:38:07,903
- I have to do my duty!
- Micah, you <i>can't</i> do this.

938
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:11,112
You'll be cursed.

939
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:21,353
<i>I'm</i> already cursed!

940
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:31,763
Please, Jonathan,

941
01:38:33,173 --> 01:38:34,697
shoot me.

942
01:38:35,876 --> 01:38:38,538
Please. I <i>can't</i> live like this.

943
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:43,043
Put me out of my misery, please.

944
01:38:44,351 --> 01:38:45,943
Please...

945
01:38:46,854 --> 01:38:48,253
I can't.

946
01:38:49,023 --> 01:38:52,481
- Help me atone for my sins.
- You're my brother.

947
01:38:53,193 --> 01:38:54,626
I love you.

948
01:38:55,896 --> 01:38:59,593
Jonathan, if you do this for me,
I'll be saved.

949
01:39:01,802 --> 01:39:04,600
Please put me out of my misery.

950
01:39:04,705 --> 01:39:08,300
- Kill me before I kill her!
- No! Micah!

951
01:39:26,527 --> 01:39:27,960
Thank you.

952
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:31,188
<i>I'm</i> free now.

953
01:39:56,857 --> 01:39:58,552
No!

954
01:40:05,232 --> 01:40:07,928
Jonathan? Jonathan?

955
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:14,936
Jonathan?

956
01:40:26,954 --> 01:40:28,353
Please.

957
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:46,036
Jonathan.

958
01:40:47,574 --> 01:40:49,064
You came back.

959
01:40:50,444 --> 01:40:53,436
Nothing or no one could ever keep us apart.

960
01:40:57,117 --> 01:41:00,575
We're going to California together,
remember?

961
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:03,112
California.

962
01:41:04,858 --> 01:41:05,825
Jonathan.

963
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:07,394
Yes?

964
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:13,757
I don't... I <i>don't</i> think
<i>I'm</i> going to make it to California.

965
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:20,203
You <i>can't</i> die. I <i>won't</i> let you die!

966
01:41:20,841 --> 01:41:23,275
I <i>don't</i> think <i>I'm</i> gonna make it.

967
01:41:24,344 --> 01:41:26,141
You have to make it.

968
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:29,909
If you die, I die.

969
01:41:30,517 --> 01:41:33,850
- You can't.
- <i>Don't</i> die.

970
01:41:35,289 --> 01:41:37,484
I have nothing left but you.

971
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:41,589
If you die, I have nothing.

972
01:43:28,569 --> 01:43:31,629
<i>We saved each other</i>
<i>that cold September dawn.</i>

973
01:43:33,307 --> 01:43:38,040
<i>Sixteen children survived,</i>
<i>too young to remember, too young to tell.</i>

974
01:43:40,013 --> 01:43:43,346
<i>They were taken to Mormon families</i>
<i>to be raised.</i>

975
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:46,817
<i>It was a year and a half before</i>
<i>the United States Army tracked them down</i>

976
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,514
<i>and returned them to their relatives.</i>

977
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:53,020
<i>The story of hate will eventually die.</i>

978
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:56,821
<i>The story of love will last forever.</i>

979
01:43:59,299 --> 01:44:02,097
<i>When did you first hear</i>
<i>of the attack and destruction</i>

980
01:44:02,202 --> 01:44:07,105
<i>of this Arkansas company</i>
<i>at Mountain Meadows in September 1857?</i>

981
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:10,767
I did not learn anything
of the attack or destruction

982
01:44:10,877 --> 01:44:15,576
of the Arkansas company
until some time after it occurred,

983
01:44:15,682 --> 01:44:17,707
and then only by floating rumor.

984
01:44:19,553 --> 01:44:23,751
<i>Did John D. Lee report to you</i>
<i>at any time after this massacre</i>

985
01:44:23,857 --> 01:44:26,690
<i>what had been done</i>
<i>at the massacre and if so,</i>

986
01:44:26,793 --> 01:44:29,455
<i>what did you reply to him</i>
<i>in reference thereto?</i>

987
01:44:29,563 --> 01:44:31,963
<i>Within some two or three months</i>
<i>after the massacre,</i>

988
01:44:32,065 --> 01:44:37,196
he called at my office and had much to say
with regard to the Indians,

989
01:44:38,538 --> 01:44:40,335
<i>their being stirred up to anger</i>

990
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:42,738
<i>and threatening the settlement</i>
<i>of the whites.</i>

991
01:44:42,843 --> 01:44:45,812
<i>He then commenced</i>
<i>giving an account of the massacre.</i>

992
01:44:45,912 --> 01:44:51,782
I told him to stop. I did not wish my feelings
harrowed up by a recital of details.

993
01:44:52,886 --> 01:44:56,151
<i>Did you, on the 10th of September 1857,</i>

994
01:44:56,256 --> 01:44:58,816
<i>receive a communication</i>
<i>from Isaac C. Haight,</i>

995
01:44:58,925 --> 01:45:00,825
<i>or any other person of Cedar City,</i>

996
01:45:00,927 --> 01:45:04,829
<i>concerning a company of emigrants</i>
<i>called the Arkansas company?</i>

997
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:08,998
<i>I did, from Isaac C. Haight</i>

998
01:45:10,504 --> 01:45:14,941
or John D. Lee,
who was a farmer for the Indians.

999
01:45:17,778 --> 01:45:21,077
<i>- And have you that communication?</i>
<i>- I have not.</i>

1000
01:45:22,282 --> 01:45:26,048
I have made diligent search for it,
but I cannot find it.

1001
01:45:27,387 --> 01:45:29,480
<i>Did you answer that communication?</i>

1002
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:36,187
<i>I did, to Isaac C. Haight, who was</i>
<i>then acting President at Cedar City.</i>

1003
01:45:37,698 --> 01:45:41,225
<i>Will you state the substance</i>
<i>of your letter to him?</i>

1004
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:45,601
Yes, it was to allow
this company of emigrants

1005
01:45:45,706 --> 01:45:47,901
- and all companies of emigrants...
- Ready.

1006
01:45:48,008 --> 01:45:50,909
<i>... to pass through the country unmolested.</i>

1007
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:52,569
Aim.

1008
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:58,413
And to allay the angry feelings
of the Indians as much as possible.

1009
01:45:58,785 --> 01:45:59,945
Fire.
