1
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,332
"Four thousand horses
lost to raiders in three months.

2
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,526
Need for more men to protect herds
desperate. Repeat, desperate.

3
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,103
John Hudson,
Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Cavalry."

4
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,466
More men, more men.

5
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,234
There isn't a command in the Army
that doesn't want men.

6
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,311
He'll have to do with what he has.
Well, Colonel Sharpe?

7
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,677
Hudson's tried to reach the railhead
by every route available.

8
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,375
Yet our forces have always
been intercepted by raiders.

9
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,817
Our spring offensive depends
on the strength of our cavalry units...

10
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,149
...and that means horses.

11
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:07,259
Fort Hedley's in the center
of all the great southwestern herds.

12
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,219
It was your idea to establish
a purchasing depot there.

13
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,455
Now, what are you doing about it?

14
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,634
We've known that the Confederacy
has a well-organized spy system.

15
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,667
They know the importance
of horses to us.

16
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,896
Their men may operate
even in our own fort.

17
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,770
All I was permitted to do was to send
a private detective out there, a civilian.

18
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,501
Everyone spotted him right away.

19
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,475
General, as I've told you many times...

20
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,980
...the only answer to their espionage
is an espionage system of our own.

21
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,211
- Taken it up three times with the Cabinet.
- Don't they want to win?

22
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,379
They won't stand for our men in uniform
being secret agents.

23
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,525
They stand for enemy agents
knocking the war out from under us.

24
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:44,527
They think spying is beneath the dignity
and honor of an Army man. That settles it.

25
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,790
How do you expect me
to get those horses here?

26
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,026
Colonel Sharpe, there's a war going on
a few miles south of here.

27
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,604
If we are to mount a successful offensive
in the spring and end the war...

28
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,673
...we must have horses.
Thousands of them.

29
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,209
That's why Hudson's out at Fort Hedley,
and why you're chief of planning.

30
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,679
I don't care how you handle it, but don't
come to me with it again. Just get horses.

31
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,990
It isn't that they know
the route that's important.

32
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,287
You can't hide the trail
of hundreds of horses.

33
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,625
But they know in advance
what pass we're going to cross.

34
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,927
That's their advantage.
They don't have to spread their men so thin.

35
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,764
You must have some idea
how the information's getting out.

36
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,136
The whole town's full of people
trying to sell horses and information.

37
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,640
I can't do it all alone.

38
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,746
George, I know, officially,
you're here on a routine inspection.

39
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:38,145
Unofficially, you're probably
looking for a chance to replace me.

40
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,084
Well, if they don't send me enough men
to do the job, let them replace me.

41
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,849
It'd be much easier
leading a bayonet charge back there.

42
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,457
Mr. Quint, will you excuse us?

43
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,391
I have a confidential matter
to discuss with Colonel Hudson.

44
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,963
Certainly. Certainly, sir.

45
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,606
I wasn't able to get you more men.

46
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:05,175
But before I came, I stopped at the arsenal
at Springfield, Massachusetts.

47
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,210
Without orders, I may add.

48
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,111
John, some gunsmith is trying
a new idea with the Springfield rifle.

49
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,479
I saw a demonstration that was amazing.

50
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,645
No more muzzle loading.
It operates with a new bridge action.

51
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,623
That rifle can be loaded and fired so fast,
it'll make each man equal to five.

52
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,090
When can I get them?

53
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,393
May be a long time
before they're ready.

54
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,932
- Springfield people experiment in secret.
- Then what good are they to us?

55
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,065
Maybe I can convince them
to let us experiment in action.

56
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,002
If not, I'll have to wait
until they aren't looking.

57
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,505
Can't get them any other way.

58
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,973
In the meantime, I'm supposed
to use magic to get the horses through.

59
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,604
Magic and that incompetent you sent me
who calls himself a detective.

60
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,377
Now I'll let you in
on a little secret, George.

61
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,453
I think we have the raiders
fooled this time.

62
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,558
I've sent the drive out under Lex Kearny,
the new major just assigned me.

63
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,490
He's taking a route those raiders
will never anticipate.

64
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,131
Right over the highest peaks
in the range.

65
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,426
Snow, the year round,
through Grey Rock Pass...

66
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,536
...which is 9000 feet above sea level.

67
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,405
- Major Kearny?
- Yes, sergeant?

68
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,667
That's Grey Rock Pass, just ahead.

69
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,936
I told you we'd make it this time.

70
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,161
What are the orders, major?

71
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,899
Those raiders outnumber us
at least 4-1, Captain Tennick.

72
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,873
Let them have the herd,
make a run for it back to the fort.

73
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,636
That's desertion. Give me the men.

74
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,077
I'll delay them
while you get the horses through.

75
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,810
Captain, we're leaving the herd.
Form up at the rear, now.

76
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,351
Form up at the rear, sergeant.

77
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,354
If I wanted the sergeant
to carry out the order, I'd issue it.

78
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,515
Get in form, captain.

79
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,421
Form up at the rear!

80
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,886
Form up at the rear!

81
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,037
- Is Colonel Hudson alone?
- No. But you can go in, Mr. Quint.

82
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,541
Thanks.

83
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,211
Troop's back, colonel.

84
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,315
You've got another "no delivery" dispatch
to send to Washington.

85
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,644
- Casualties?
- Nope.

86
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,685
Just the herd this time.
Great beginning for the new major.

87
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:12,120
I thought Kearny could get
the herd through if anyone could.

88
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,087
They told me you're the best detective
the Army could hire.

89
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,456
Why don't you find out
who the raiders are?

90
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,464
First things come first with me, colonel.
I don't care who the raiders are.

91
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,932
I wanna know
where they get their information.

92
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,833
I don't like the way you say that, Quint.

93
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,605
That's my plan, colonel.

94
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,368
If you don't like that way,
you can always make a change.

95
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,442
- Major Kearny, sir.
- Send him in.

96
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,852
Sit down, Lex.

97
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,686
Shall I make my report in front of him?

98
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,088
Don't be bashful, major.
I already made it for you.

99
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,528
Go ahead, Lex.

100
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,360
As instructed, I didn't open the sealed
orders until we arrived at Taos Wells.

101
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,868
The orders said to take the herd
by way of the Dundalk Flats route.

102
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,166
They were waiting for us
on the other side of Grey Rock Pass.

103
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,138
Did anyone have access to the orders...

104
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,835
...from the time you left
until you reached Taos Wells?

105
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,437
No, sir.

106
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,139
After you opened the orders,
who saw them besides you?

107
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,114
Captain Tennick and Sergeant Snow.

108
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,278
After they learned which route,
were they ever out of your sight?

109
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,015
Here and there,
but then I was out of theirs.

110
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,125
Did you get a look at any of the raiders?

111
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,695
- We didn't put up a fight.
- Why not?

112
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,433
- Permission to see the colonel, sir.
- Captain Tennick.

113
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,398
I request a court-martial.

114
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,539
- Against whom and on what charges?
- Against Major Kearny.

115
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,931
Charges of willful disobedience
of orders...

116
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,474
...and misconduct
in the presence of the enemy.

117
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:42,273
Quite some charges from a man
I could arrest for insubordination.

118
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,940
Sir, the orders were, "Defend the herd
with force against enemy attack."

119
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,643
Major Kearny ordered us
to desert the herd.

120
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,582
I've known Lex Kearny for a long time.
I was his duty officer at West Point.

121
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,225
He couldn't commit such an act.

122
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,918
I'm sure his reasons for the retreat
were honorable.

123
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,121
I recommend you withdraw your request.

124
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,960
I respectfully decline
your recommendation, sir.

125
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,293
You're certain
you have sufficient grounds?

126
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,505
I'm certain, sir.

127
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,272
Request granted.

128
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,005
Thank you, sir.

129
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,478
Has he sufficient grounds, Lex?

130
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,818
Yes, sir.

131
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,784
He wants these gold leaves.

132
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,547
Charge: Violation
of the 52nd Article of War.

133
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,286
"Neglect of duty and cowardice
in the face of the enemy.

134
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:34,092
Sacrificing war material, specifically
a vitally needed shipment of horses."

135
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:38,202
How does the accused plead
to the charge and specifications?

136
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,098
Not guilty by reason of circumstances.

137
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,603
This is his official service record.

138
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,337
"Major Alexander Kearny
was born in Virginia.

139
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,811
At West Point,
before the declaration of war...

140
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,314
...he openly sympathized
with his home state.

141
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:56,379
At the outbreak of the war, he submitted
his resignation from the Army...

142
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,319
...giving reason as reluctance
to fight against the South.

143
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,289
He later withdrew his submission.

144
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,020
Kearny led a troop
in three engagements this year.

145
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,160
He was removed from his command because
of indecision in the presence of the enemy.

146
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,829
Official comment: Untrustworthy.
To be transferred to duty at Fort Hedley."

147
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,032
Our orders were to defend the herd
and drive them to the railroad.

148
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,541
Kearny's action was in violation
of these orders.

149
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,306
In the face of a far-superior force,
it is my judgment...

150
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,211
...that it was better to sacrifice horses
and save the men.

151
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:29,047
Then we retreated, leaving the herd
unprotected, without even firing one shot.

152
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,190
Did you hear Major Kearny tell
Captain Tennick he wouldn't fight?

153
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,384
The major said we were outnumbered
4-1, ordered us to the rear.

154
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,586
- That's all, thank you.
- Can I say something?

155
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:38,923
Certainly, sergeant.

156
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,531
I served with Major Kearny.

157
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,101
He was a lieutenant then,
at the First Battle of Bull Run in '61.

158
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,229
Our troop covered the retreat that day,
and we were the last to withdraw.

159
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,307
We didn't have to be the last...

160
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,569
...but the lieutenant
was stubborn as a mule...

161
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,837
Sergeant Snow.

162
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,981
Let him tell it in his own way.

163
00:11:56,148 --> 00:12:00,050
Well, sir, I never saw such an onerous...

164
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,517
...cuss in my whole life.

165
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,485
But he's certainly no coward.

166
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,887
The whole troop was sighted
for that action, sir.

167
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,459
But the action he speaks of
was a retreat, wasn't it?

168
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,290
Everybody knows we lost
the First Battle of Bull Run, sir.

169
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,093
It was right after I enlisted.
We were out on patrol.

170
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,667
Major Kearny, two mules,
and 10 more of us.

171
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,829
Well, all of a sudden, about 25...
Maybe it was 50.

172
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,769
Anyway, they were Stand Watie's men.

173
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,969
They came charging out of the rocks,
screaming like wildcats, firing as they come.

174
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,314
I gotta admit, I was so scared,
I couldn't fire my gun.

175
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,780
Couldn't even move.

176
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,612
Next thing I know, the major was standing
alongside me, firing and loading.

177
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,450
When he was loading,
he talked to me real quiet.

178
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,593
Major saved my life that day. I know it.

179
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:46,130
This court finds Major Alexander Kearny,
5th Cavalry, United States Army...

180
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:51,668
...guilty of gross neglect of duty by reason
of cowardice in the face of the enemy.

181
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:58,439
Alexander Kearny, you are warned
that you are liable to the death penalty...

182
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,206
...if you trespass upon the grounds
of any United States Military post...

183
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,578
...or reservation henceforth.

184
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,100
Conduct the prisoner through the gate.

185
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,527
Sergeant Snow will give you
a receipt for these, Mr. McCool.

186
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,324
And bring in more next time.

187
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,433
- My spread's not too big, colonel.
- I'll buy all you can get me.

188
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,194
How can they buy stock like that?

189
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,669
That's the sorriest-looking
bunch of jackrabbits I ever saw.

190
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,336
You ain't got nothing to say
about what the Army buys anymore...

191
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,569
...yellow-belly.

192
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:44,045
Never could understand why you were
particular with us ranchers, major.

193
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:49,545
Unless you were making sure those raiders
got good, sound horse flesh.

194
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,715
Sir, Kearny's giving the Army a bad name,
hanging around like this.

195
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,861
I know we don't have
jurisdiction over him.

196
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,292
I wish there were some way
to get him out of town.

197
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,091
He'll be leaving soon, lieutenant.

198
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:03,523
Captain Tennick.

199
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:09,029
Captain Tennick, I see you haven't got
my gold leaves yet.

200
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,976
You're mighty brave
with that whip, captain.

201
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,606
I'll be back without my whip
when I get my herd through the railhead.

202
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,186
There's something eating that fella.

203
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,789
I'm not so sure he's yellow.

204
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,612
Erin.

205
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,358
What in the world are you doing here?

206
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,029
Hasn't a wife a right
to come and see her husband?

207
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,103
Colonel John wrote me.

208
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,334
I like you in civilian clothes.

209
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,770
What did Hudson say?

210
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,545
Oh, Lex, I don't care
what happened here.

211
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,614
You hated this war in the first place.

212
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,216
You've given enough of
your life to the Army.

213
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,786
Let's just be grateful it's over
for you at last, and you can come home.

214
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:34,119
You've been gone so long, darling, your son
hardly remembers what you look like.

215
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,586
What does he look like?

216
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,320
You see?

217
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,795
You don't remember him either.

218
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,995
Jamie's grown up.

219
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,537
He's a man.

220
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,539
Yes, and he needs a father.

221
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,943
Erin, I'm not going home with you.

222
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,447
Why?

223
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,718
Until this war is over,
I have to do what I think is right.

224
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,149
Else I'll never be able
to look at you again.

225
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,588
Or Jamie, or myself.

226
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,557
Why don't you trust me?

227
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:14,893
Men have to do strange things sometimes
that they don't like to tell their wives about.

228
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,900
There's nothing to do
with not trusting them.

229
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,597
When do you want me to go back?

230
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,866
Stagecoach leaves in the morning.

231
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,907
In the morning.

232
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,244
There's another one in a couple of days.

233
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:37,479
And when you pay your respects
to Colonel John...

234
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,250
...tell him to mind his own business.

235
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,519
And I'll mind mine.

236
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,065
That new whiskey, Old Crow.

237
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,778
Pour it.

238
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,976
Pour it yourself, Copperhead.

239
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,150
I'll do the honors.

240
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,191
Another glass, bartender.

241
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,455
- I assume you're treating.
- Help yourself.

242
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,259
Thanks.

243
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,397
To the Union.

244
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,141
He won't drink to that.

245
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,374
I'll bet you 10 he will.

246
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,680
To the Union.

247
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,426
Why didn't you go home with your wife?

248
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,995
Is that any of your business?

249
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,530
I got enough to worry about here
without you.

250
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,965
Maybe this drive will get through,
and you'll have less to worry about.

251
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,163
The drive didn't get through.
I guess maybe you already know that.

252
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,672
A scout brought the word in
about an hour ago.

253
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,037
Over half of them were killed.

254
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,779
- Tennick?
- I don't know.

255
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,581
Troop's back.

256
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,614
Caught two raiders,
they're bringing them in.

257
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,056
The rest of them got away,
but they shot the horses from under two.

258
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,695
See you.

259
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,216
Captain Tennick,
what's that on your blouse, dirt?

260
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:51,413
Or is that the blood of some of the troopers
who died out there for you?

261
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,491
Are you proud of yourself,
Captain Tennick?

262
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,462
Do you feel like a brave man now?

263
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,431
Lieutenant Johnson, take over the detail.

264
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,639
Go for the guard. Post number one.

265
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,368
Guard detail, over the gate.

266
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,351
Look out, Mr. Kearny, don't come inside.

267
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,529
Arrest him. He's on military property.

268
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,632
The death penalty can go at this,
did you forget?

269
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,636
I did, but you didn't.

270
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,002
Take him to the guardhouse.

271
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,076
Open up, guard.

272
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:19,443
- Was it bad?
- We can hold out.

273
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,649
They might not hang you
if you tell them what they wanna know.

274
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,149
They ain't gonna hang us.

275
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,296
Give me your belt too.

276
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,593
Tie them together.

277
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,720
Nice, thoughtful friends you got.

278
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,695
- You ain't in on this.
- Get back there.

279
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,199
Just sit tight and you won't get hurt.

280
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,010
This ought to warm
your ivory dome, baldy.

281
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,513
Yeah, thanks.

282
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:42,619
Feels good on top of my head,
but it don't penetrate. My insides are cold.

283
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,813
I'm about to bust out crying.

284
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,819
You can have these two 10's
if you'll get us whiskey.

285
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,690
What is it, Confederate money?

286
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,922
U.S. Treasury, it's the real thing.

287
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,227
Sure, what's he gonna do with it
where he's going?

288
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,501
Twenty dollars.

289
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,969
One 10 now and one 10
when you bring the whiskey.

290
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,772
Give me the money.

291
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,294
Where's the other 10?

292
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,524
- Right here.
- Stick a bottle through first.

293
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,968
Don't break it, open the door.

294
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,574
Give me that 10
and get back to your bunks.

295
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,239
I will when you give me
the bottle of whiskey.

296
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,447
Do it my way, you won't never get it.

297
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,305
Straighten up.

298
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,503
Drop that gun.

299
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,429
Through the main gate.

300
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:02,882
No.

301
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,358
Kearny, what are you doing here?

302
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:44,025
Wait here.

303
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,096
You stay with him.

304
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,537
Good evening.

305
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,698
How come?

306
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,605
- He helped us break.
- Let him tell it.

307
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,810
We shared the same cell, we were gonna
share the same appointment in the morning.

308
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,213
So we shared the same breakout.

309
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,046
- Where's Elm?
- Last time we saw him...

310
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,278
Let him tell it.

311
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,253
I guess he's looking for a horse,
I borrowed his.

312
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,289
Why did you come out here with them?

313
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,951
Well, we just naturally all ran
in the same direction.

314
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,619
You didn't have to run, major.

315
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,289
Once you were off military property
they couldn't touch you and you know it.

316
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,492
Why did you come here?

317
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,365
- Hadn't been for him, we couldn't make it.
- That's right.

318
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,506
You've got 20 miles to cover tonight.

319
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,574
Kind of late, can't we bunk here?

320
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,234
No, the Army's wise
to your little secret now.

321
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,972
This ranch and the town's
off limits to you both.

322
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,810
Water your horses and get going.

323
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,212
Talk.

324
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:38,482
Well, I came out here to ask you for a job.
Of course, I didn't know it was you.

325
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,682
If I had, I'd ask you for it in town.

326
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,554
So you want a job.

327
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,423
Well, I wouldn't have gone
to all this trouble if I didn't.

328
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:46,621
What kind of trouble?

329
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,390
Soon as I heard they got raiders...

330
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,932
...I got arrested
and thrown in the cell with them.

331
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,400
None of them seem to stay
in jail too long before.

332
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:58,440
Well, if you don't wanna hire me, just forget
all about it, and I'll mosey on back to town.

333
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,771
You can't go back, major. Not now.

334
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,640
You're either in or you're through.

335
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,115
Where's Sims and Mizzell?

336
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:11,687
I'm gonna fix those...

337
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,483
Kearny.

338
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:18,192
I told you never to run a horse like that.
Look at him. Where'd you get him?

339
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,923
Rented him in town from the blacksmith.

340
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,498
What's so funny?

341
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,862
That's one thing
they got plenty of, is horses.

342
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,197
- And you had to rent one.
- What's he doing here?

343
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,669
I don't know yet.

344
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,808
Rub down those animals
and hit the bunk.

345
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,909
His too?

346
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:36,445
It's your horse.
Unless you're making him a present of it.

347
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,513
Come along with me, major.

348
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,015
All right, Mr. McCool.

349
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,569
Pick yourself a horse.

350
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,611
And use this outfit.

351
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,156
- Any one?
- Suit yourself.

352
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:20,655
I'll take the black.

353
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,053
You ain't giving it to him.

354
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,060
You got one horse you can ride,
do you want another you can't?

355
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,285
Morning, Mr. McCool.

356
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,927
How do you like it?
What Yankees wouldn't give...

357
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,192
...to know about this.

358
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,633
It's a wonderful hideout, but you can't
keep these horses here forever.

359
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,740
You joined up just in time
to get the answer to that one, major.

360
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,808
Those horses represent five raids.

361
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,171
There's close to 1000 head
down there.

362
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:16,438
We're gonna drive them
over the mountains.

363
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,310
From there on, they don't go north,
they go south.

364
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,645
For the right price too.

365
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,547
All right, Pete, stir them up.

366
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,849
Follow me, major.

367
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,998
Come on, Rebs, stir it up!

368
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,227
This ain't no cotillion.

369
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,898
Come on, boys, pack and saddle up.
We're heading south.

370
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,565
Money in the sock, boys.

371
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,138
When I say move, I mean move!

372
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,580
He knows how to handle
those kind real well.

373
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,981
They're no-goods,
deserters and freebooters.

374
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:59,351
But the boys in gray,
they're patriots like you, major.

375
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,515
Those Southern gentlemen
are great fighters.

376
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,490
There isn't anything they won't tackle.

377
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,494
What's to keep them from breaking out
and going it alone?

378
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:10,122
After all, there's no corner
on the raiding business these days.

379
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,428
Maybe not,
but there's knowing where to raid.

380
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,366
They're ready.

381
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:23,139
Men, this is the major that got himself
cashiered out of the Yankee Army...

382
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:26,283
...for having Southern sympathy
which they couldn't prove.

383
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:29,249
Now, he'll have a chance to prove them.

384
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:35,889
- Come on, boy.
- Ride by twos.

385
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,692
Major Kearny? My name's Jim Randolph.

386
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,559
Ex-major, please, Mr. Randolph.

387
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,862
Nice to have you with us, sir.

388
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,299
- You're from Virginia, I hear.
- That's right. You?

389
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,631
South Carolina.

390
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,574
You know, sir,
I had you in my sights once.

391
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,835
Used to ride with Stand Watie.

392
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,740
And now, I'm right glad I missed you.

393
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,642
Well, I'm glad you did too.

394
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,010
How come you left that outfit
for this one?

395
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,846
Some of us were sent over here
to join McCool.

396
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,184
I reckon horses are almost
more important than men these days.

397
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:17,658
- All the rest of you from Stand Watie?
- Oh, no, sir. They come from all over.

398
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,060
Some had their commands smashed up,
drifted out here.

399
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:25,066
They're all fine folk. Not like Elm's trash.

400
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,262
Aren't there enough of us to work alone?
Do we need big Pete Elm?

401
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,634
No, but we need McCool.

402
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:34,437
Without him, we'd never know which way
the Yankees were sending their herds.

403
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:38,207
We ask him how he gets his information,
he just laughs at us.

404
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,248
McCool likes Elm, so that's it.

405
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,682
Sims! Mizzell!

406
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,816
You two still here?

407
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:52,895
Hightail it over that hill
and roust out the commission boys.

408
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:56,329
And no drinks. If they're ready for us,
get back here pronto.

409
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,465
You know we've got a feeding problem.

410
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,765
Quicker you get back,
quicker we get rid of it.

411
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,306
We can't sell them dead horses.
Now, get going.

412
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,669
Where's he sending them?

413
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:11,110
South Fork. Bear Creek.
Some of our people are down there.

414
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,547
They pay off McCool
and take the herd from there.

415
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,436
May I borrow your mirror
when you're finished with it?

416
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:36,061
I've quite finished, Mr. Kearny.
It's yours.

417
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,305
Why, thank you, sir.

418
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:48,645
McCool, think I can cut
our feeding problem in half.

419
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,050
See that hill up there? Mizzell?

420
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,622
Post yourself on top
and wait for Sims' signal.

421
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,816
- What signal?
- Let him talk.

422
00:34:56,527 --> 00:35:00,088
Sims, when you get to South Fork,
if everything's all right...

423
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,961
...shine your mirror steady at Mizzell's
position like this for a half a minute.

424
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,831
We'll move the herd on down.
If there's something wrong...

425
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:10,269
...flick it like this. We'll stay put
till we get your go-ahead signal.

426
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,372
Was that clear?

427
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:18,474
This means "come on down,"
this means "stay where you are."

428
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:22,016
Right. Save all that time
riding back and telling us.

429
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,814
- Go ahead, men.
- Any questions?

430
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,082
What if it snows?

431
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,227
I'll send the major down.
He can teach you another trick.

432
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,358
Come on.

433
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,157
Kind of used to giving orders, aren't you?

434
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,132
What's worse, I'm used to being obeyed.

435
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,531
Well, don't overstep yourself, major.

436
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,000
Don't ever ride that horse again.

437
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,231
Easy, boy, now.

438
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,994
Put it away.

439
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,161
Let them fight.

440
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,883
Make him throw away
that Arkansas toothpick, Mr. McCool.

441
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,959
I said, let them fight.

442
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:28,074
Now you won't ride my horse,
or any other horse, for a while.

443
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:52,835
It worked, boys.
Mr. Kearny, you're right. It worked.

444
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,665
He gave me the signal to go ahead.

445
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:59,867
All right, boys, let's move!
Payday's just around the corner. Let's go!

446
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,338
Let's go!

447
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,912
Let's go.

448
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,092
Get going.

449
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,291
Let's go.

450
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,464
Well, they're all yours,
Mr. Commissioner.

451
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,804
One thousand head to take down
to the old Mississippi.

452
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:04,463
Nine hundred and eighty-four
by actual count, Mr. McCool.

453
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,974
And here, I already have
the money for them.

454
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,875
I was instructed to tell you, gentlemen,
that if you keep these horses coming...

455
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:14,745
...any offensive the Yankees
might try to start will be smashed.

456
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:18,912
We'll keep them coming
as long as this good hard cash holds up.

457
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:39,703
The Army doesn't approve of horses
from an outfit that hires a man like Kearny.

458
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,902
I don't care what the Army approves.

459
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,707
I'm a civilian. A neutral civilian.

460
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:48,348
I hire who I want. Come on.

461
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,155
What's going on here, captain?

462
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,986
That rancher McCool has hired
the escaped prisoner Kearny.

463
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,028
- He ought to be back in the guardhouse.
- I don't approve any more than you do.

464
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,963
But neither do I approve of the way
you had him arrested. You started the fight.

465
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,695
I would have been forced
to dismiss charges against him.

466
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,498
You tricked him onto the post.

467
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,300
Certainly was no premeditated action
on his part.

468
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,040
You're lucky I didn't
press charges against you...

469
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:17,840
...for brawling with a dishonorably
discharged officer.

470
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,921
- How many head have you got here?
- Eight.

471
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,684
I got some more
coming off the range Friday.

472
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,096
Seventy-five.

473
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,225
One-forty.

474
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,563
Two-twenty-five.

475
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,665
Four and a quarter.

476
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,571
Six hundred and seventy-five dollars.

477
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,304
- For all eight?
- That's all they're worth.

478
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:54,374
- Looks like the Army made a deal, major.
- I'll see you at the bar in about an hour.

479
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:58,488
I've got a little banking and some
personal business to attend to. Come on.

480
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:08,357
Sir, I'm sorry to see you
in a position like this.

481
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:10,295
Thanks, sergeant.

482
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,292
Kearny.

483
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,604
You made a grave mistake
in not going home, Lex.

484
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,835
Erin has come back.

485
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,642
Did you write her again?

486
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,476
Your boy ran away from his school.

487
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,682
Mr. Ramsey, Sergeant Poole.

488
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:14,249
I'm wondering if you and Kearny
can still shake hands.

489
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,754
Let's continue with your report, major.

490
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,296
The raiders are led by this horse rancher
named McCool...

491
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:25,401
...the one who sells a few horses
to the Army as a blind.

492
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:26,866
Got nearly hundred men.

493
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:30,006
A third of them are Confederate soldiers
on assignment for this.

494
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:33,405
And the rest of them are a bunch
of jayhawkers led by a man names Elm.

495
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,603
The captured horses are kept
in a canyon 45 miles east of here...

496
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,374
...and about once a month,
they run them to Bear Creek...

497
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,314
...where they turn them over
to the Confederate agents.

498
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:43,510
That's the picture.

499
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,485
Good job, major.

500
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:50,252
Thank you, colonel. And now, sir, I request
that I be relieved of the assignment.

501
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,292
That calls for an explanation, major.

502
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,354
I consider myself a bad risk.

503
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,795
It'll take just one mistake
to smoke us out.

504
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,992
Colonel, permit me
to speak for the major.

505
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,501
He has a personal problem.
His wife's here.

506
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,162
What's that got to do with it?

507
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,174
Because I had no idea what the effect
of this would be on my family.

508
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,209
Kearny, all these men have problems too.

509
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,780
Excuse me, colonel,
it's a little different with Lex.

510
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:16,010
His boy ran away from school because
he couldn't stand the disgrace of his father.

511
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,679
Why'd you volunteer
for this assignment, Lex?

512
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,347
Because I wanted to see
this war ended quick...

513
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,289
...and I thought the idea
of counterintelligence...

514
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:25,951
...was the best way to help it.

515
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,324
Then get on with this job.

516
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,092
If you don't, you'll spend
your days with a brand on you:

517
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:33,065
Traitor and coward.
It's in your record. We had it put there.

518
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,000
To reinstate you now would expose us.

519
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,969
I can't change your record back.

520
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,200
Very well, sir.
What do you want me to do?

521
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:42,774
Find out how McCool's getting
his information to intercept the herds.

522
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,140
How do you stand with him?

523
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:48,076
About as well as anyone, I think.
But he confides in no one.

524
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:51,187
If he were removed, could you work
into a position of authority?

525
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,789
- It's possible.
- Then McCool must be removed.

526
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,016
Give me permission
to pick a fight with him?

527
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,593
It has to be done so his contact
won't be scared off.

528
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,356
This is the way.
The Southern spy ring is widespread.

529
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,295
They undoubtedly have a man out here.

530
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,731
We must get to him
and destroy him through McCool.

531
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,994
The best way to do that is on a raid.

532
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:11,839
- Who's leading the detail on the next drive?
- I am, sir.

533
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,534
Good. Then your job is to kill McCool.

534
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,647
He rides a big pinto.
It's the only one in the outfit.

535
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:22,809
I'll flash you a signal before the attack
and maneuver him into position for you.

536
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,886
Thanks. I'll get him.

537
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,323
After you're top dog with that outfit...

538
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,621
...if the key man wants to do business,
he'll get in touch with you.

539
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:35,026
When you know your man,
get word to Poole.

540
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,599
Poole will tell Ramsey,
and Ramsey will send for me.

541
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,963
- Any questions?
- No, sir.

542
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,268
Leave one at a time at intervals
of two minutes. Dismissed.

543
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,603
- Sir, may I be the first to leave?
- Yes, Poole.

544
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:53,282
Sorry about your boy, Lex.
Wish there were something I could do.

545
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,078
There is, sir. Here's his picture.

546
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,585
You try the recruiting offices
near Philadelphia...

547
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,087
...I think he can be located.

548
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,782
His mother and I will be very grateful.

549
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,986
- lf he's in the services, I'll find him for you.
- Thank you, sir.

550
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,035
What a licking that man's taking.

551
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,267
- He'll stand up.
- I'm sure he will.

552
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,345
Because he has faith. Faith in people.
Faith in a strong Union.

553
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:28,250
I hope someday his family will understand
and appreciate what he is doing.

554
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,886
I found out just after
I got back to Philadelphia.

555
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,817
The news of you was in all the papers.

556
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,390
I tried to keep it from Jamie,
but his schoolmates...

557
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,186
You know how cruel children can be.

558
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,089
His whole world crashed, I suppose,
and he ran away.

559
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:43,631
- Where?
- I don't know. I've tried everywhere.

560
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:47,601
I thought he might have come out here
to you to see if it were true.

561
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:50,199
Colonel John thinks he may have
joined the Army.

562
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,672
But he's too young, isn't he, Lex?

563
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,004
Drummer, bugler, dispatch runner...

564
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,977
They take them now
if they pass for 15. He'd pass.

565
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,640
Colonel John's tracing all enlistments.
He said he'd do everything he could.

566
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,014
Jamie will change his name.
Wouldn't use Kearny.

567
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:06,051
Then we'll never find him.

568
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:07,690
Lex, you've got to do something.

569
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:11,885
Staying here, what you're trying to prove,
is not worth our son's life. Nothing is.

570
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,997
If you hadn't come in the first place
you might've stopped him.

571
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,794
If you were a good mother,
that's where you'd be. At home. Now.

572
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,199
Kids get scared when they
go out on their own.

573
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:24,431
He might come creeping back,
and you ought to be there to help him.

574
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,543
What good does it do
to come wailing to me?

575
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,373
With Jamie gone,
I thought I belonged with my husband.

576
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:31,571
You can't be with me.

577
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:35,149
I've got things to do right now
which you're interfering with.

578
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:42,325
Lex, I'm afraid. Please, let me stay.

579
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,693
I've said everything I can say.

580
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,763
I wish you'd go back,
but I can't make you.

581
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:55,771
Just think, Mr. Kearny...

582
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:59,966
...I might've plugged you that time.
Been a downright sin.

583
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,648
We ought to be up on the ridge
where we can see the herd coming.

584
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,580
Why be on that ridge freezing?
The lookouts will signal us.

585
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,152
I don't like all this looking-glass
monkey business.

586
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,221
Well, it worked before, didn't it?

587
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,884
It's working now too.

588
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,694
On your horses, men!

589
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,202
Not yet. They're still too far away.

590
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,130
Who says so?

591
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,899
It's a code, Pete. It spells out words.

592
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,602
I'll ride on up there to make sure
of Sims and Mizzell.

593
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,272
All right, stay put.
But be ready to move out.

594
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:43,586
All right, major. Go ahead.

595
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:01,463
You go back and signal McCool
to get the men into position.

596
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,299
Sims will flash you when to attack.

597
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:26,086
Hold!

598
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:33,761
This is it.

599
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,541
- Assemble at the rear.
- Yes, sir.

600
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,178
Assemble at the rear!

601
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,910
Assemble at the rear!

602
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:03,059
They must have seen
them stinking looking glasses.

603
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,201
Well, it's a perfect spot for an ambush.

604
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,303
After all, they've had some experience.

605
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,439
They're getting cagey, aren't they?

606
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:12,507
Well, if this is what they want,
we'll give it to them.

607
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,303
Come on!

608
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:19,978
Drive them. Move them fast.

609
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,658
Get after that herd!

610
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:18,490
Catch me a horse.

611
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:42,725
Dirty double-crosser.

612
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:14,917
You sure got even with that fella.

613
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:38,938
They got Mac
because of your looking glasses.

614
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:41,083
I ought to put a bullet through your head!

615
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:49,216
Be careful you don't get one in yours.

616
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,884
Now, get after your men! They're scattering
the herd all over the mountain.

617
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:07,968
Fool, are you all right?

618
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:10,044
- Yes, sir.
- Can you make it?

619
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,272
Pick up a stray horse
as soon as we've left.

620
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,110
McCool's dead and so is Tennick.

621
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,751
Retreat!

622
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,442
There you are. Count it up quick.

623
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,018
- Next.
- Yankee dollars, Jim.

624
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:54,179
Send them home to your family.
May come a time they'll be useful.

625
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,585
If you're smart, you'll take them home, boy.
This outfit's finished.

626
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:01,197
We're not finished. Long as Yankees try
to get horses over the mountain...

627
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:02,592
...we'll try to stop them.

628
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,360
- You know who Mac's friend was in town?
- No.

629
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,868
But we'll follow the herds to the hills
and take our chances.

630
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,007
You'll get picked off like flies, brother.

631
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:15,042
Gotta know where they're heading, be there
first with the most. Only way it'll work.

632
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,269
Just a minute, men.

633
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:18,209
Captain Spencer has the right idea...

634
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:20,713
...but I believe he's going about it
the wrong way.

635
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,680
If we sit tight here and have patience...

636
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:27,220
...McCool's friend will let himself
be known to us.

637
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:31,349
Whoever he is, he must know
that Mac trusts us.

638
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,119
Especially Pete here.
And he'll get in touch with him.

639
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:37,061
Meantime, Pete and I will continue
at the ranch near town...

640
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:38,962
...and sell a few horses to the Army.

641
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:42,601
But keep quiet about McCool being dead.

642
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:46,367
Informers scare easy, and he may never
show his nose here again.

643
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:49,671
- And I think we ought to give it a try.
- That's right, men.

644
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,838
Me and the major got the same ideas.
We ain't quitting.

645
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,678
You can't make money like this
no place else.

646
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:59,215
All we can lose is a little time, boys.

647
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,461
Thank you, Mr. Kearny.
We're with you, of course.

648
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:09,029
All right, come on.
Step up here and get your money.

649
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,564
Count it out.

650
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,797
Sir, will you take a look over there?

651
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:23,669
Where's McCool?

652
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,179
Down in Texas,
bringing back a string of mustangs.

653
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,749
We're kind of taking care of things
while Mac's gone.

654
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:32,410
- I see. How many?
- Dozen head.

655
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:36,821
Four hundred and twenty...

656
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,620
...four-eighty...

657
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:40,262
...five-sixty...

658
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:42,563
...seven-twenty...

659
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,724
...eight hundred and forty...

660
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,266
...nine hundred...

661
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,529
...nine-fifty...

662
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,043
...ten hundred and sixty-five dollars.

663
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,346
All right.

664
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:02,609
Sergeant Snow,
give the receipt to Mr. Elm.

665
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,167
Anybody talk to you?

666
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:28,141
Me neither.
This idea of yours ain't working.

667
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,570
Give it a chance.

668
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,663
We already lost one herd.

669
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:50,761
First thing you know,
we'll be losing another.

670
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,061
May be all right for you la-di-da boys
from the South...

671
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,933
...to be hibernating around camp
like a bunch of she-bears.

672
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,538
But it ain't easy for me to keep my men
from hightailing out of there.

673
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,007
What are you doing in there?

674
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:03,509
Found one of McCool's maps.

675
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,446
He's made penciled crosses
where he intercepted every one of the herds.

676
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:10,182
Ain't that nice.

677
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,790
The Army's coming!

678
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:21,063
If they think they got something on us...

679
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:25,364
- We'll give them a welcome.
- Put those guns away.

680
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,838
Let me handle it.

681
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,341
How do you do, sir.

682
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,538
Sit down.

683
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:44,718
So McCool's dead.

684
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:46,685
Where'd you find out about that?

685
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:49,756
McCool would never go to Texas.
His business is all here.

686
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:53,327
- Listen, Mr. Army, if you're trying to...
- Wait a minute, Pete.

687
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:56,988
I thought McCool had taken you two
into his confidence before he was killed.

688
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,292
Maybe he did.

689
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:03,201
If he had, about 500 more horses
would be in Confederate hands today.

690
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,440
Did McCool have a map around here?

691
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:07,576
- Well...
- Not that I know of.

692
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:10,806
Well, he had one like this someplace.

693
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:13,513
How much did I pay you
for that last string?

694
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:17,177
- Ten hundred and sixty-five dollars.
- Forget the 10.

695
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:20,584
Let's just deal with the last two digits:
Six and five.

696
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:24,693
Notice on the map, the longitudinal sides
are all numbered from one to nine.

697
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,419
The latitudinal, the same.

698
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:28,689
Now, let's take our numbers...

699
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,900
...the longitudinal six
and latitudinal five as coordinates...

700
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,593
...and see where we cross.

701
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:37,069
Right about here, isn't it?
And where are we?

702
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,640
- Yellow Rock Pass.
- Exactly.

703
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,936
That was the route taken
by the last herd.

704
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,773
Well, I'll be.
You've been telling us all the time.

705
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:49,110
Remember when I bought your horses?
The price never came out in round numbers.

706
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:52,777
That was because the last two digits
had to indicate the route of the drive.

707
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:54,446
Simple, but effective.

708
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,616
I advised McCool to take someone
into his confidence...

709
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:00,991
...in case anything happened to him.
But he wanted to play it alone.

710
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:04,156
Well, partner, we're in business again.

711
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,701
Yes. You better get up to the canyon
and tell the men we've made contact.

712
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,997
But no names. This is our deal.

713
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:13,074
Right, major. You and me's the brains.

714
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,777
- He has his uses.
- Yes, so I understand.

715
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,951
I didn't like telling him,
but I couldn't speak to you alone...

716
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,612
...without making him suspicious.
And my own men too.

717
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:29,385
What are they thinking now?

718
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,891
That I'm stirring you up
to bring in more horses.

719
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,928
I was careful to visit
several other ranches today.

720
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:38,465
Lex, I can't tell you how glad
I am to have you with us.

721
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,500
Wasn't sure of you at the court-martial.

722
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,831
And I was afraid that Erin
might influence you.

723
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:47,075
But when you refused to go home
and stayed on with McCool...

724
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:52,113
I feel for you with Erin.
I know what she means to you.

725
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,147
- Is she still in town?
- Yes, but don't worry.

726
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,047
I put out a tracer for your boy.

727
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,678
When he's been located, at least Erin
won't be staying close by.

728
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:03,018
And after the war, well...

729
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:06,821
...bitterness loses its taste,
many things are forgotten.

730
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,988
- I hope so.
- I must go.

731
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:12,166
Can't stay too long.

732
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:18,438
We'll work well together, Lex.
Oh, by the way...

733
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:21,634
...there's a shipment coming in.
A new kind of rifle.

734
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:24,279
The South could make good use of it.

735
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:28,406
When the time comes, I want you to
organize a little raid on our supply wagons.

736
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:30,882
I'll be glad to, sir.

737
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:37,520
John Hudson, their key man.
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

738
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:41,425
I might be able to get his ledger.
It'll have entries of all his purchases...

739
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:43,827
...and correspond with the
locations on that map.

740
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,060
Yeah. There's a better way
to do it, I think.

741
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:49,568
Kearny, get horses,
bring them for Hudson to buy.

742
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:54,108
I'll be at corrals when he names his price.
When you have the receipt, I'll arrest him.

743
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,643
If he has a ledger,
that'll be so much the better.

744
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,940
Take him to Washington,
confront the staff...

745
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:02,881
...with the proof that the only way to
fight espionage is with counterespionage.

746
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:06,453
I'll bring some horses with Elm,
and you can arrest him with Hudson.

747
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:07,919
Right.

748
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:11,185
Before I left Washington, Halleck
gave me high-command opinion...

749
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,591
...on organizing a group like ours.
They laughed at the general.

750
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,460
Said since counterespionage
wasn't in the dictionary...

751
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:21,194
...it seemed ridiculous to try to create
something that couldn't be defined.

752
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:25,704
Well, we're defining it for him.
And in great big capital letters.

753
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,566
- Any questions?
- Yes, sir.

754
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:31,840
What about those rifles you said you had
brought in the hard hardtack boxes, sir?

755
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:36,178
I packed them that way. In case the wrong
man got to snooping. Lucky, isn't it?

756
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,912
I was supposed
to steal those when they arrived.

757
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:42,683
That's how I got them, but we'll upset
your plan. Thank goodness they're here.

758
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:47,228
The firepower in these Springfield rifles will
multiply the strength of our garrison by five.

759
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:50,126
It'll give us the equivalent of 250 men.

760
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:52,995
We'll outnumber
the raiders and outfire them.

761
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:54,659
Any further questions?

762
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:57,572
The major won't be
the first to leave today.

763
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,436
Your son's been found,
Lex, safe and sound.

764
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,306
He'd enlisted under
the unusual name of John Smith.

765
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,447
Held at Chestnut Hill recruiting station.

766
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,778
- You'll want to tell your wife, I know.
- Yes, sir.

767
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:13,816
Erin.

768
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,387
- Erin?
- Lex?

769
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,117
Yes.

770
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,561
Honey.

771
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:30,002
Jamie's been found.
And he's safe, and he's well.

772
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:31,640
How do you know?

773
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:37,102
I can't tell you, but he was at Chestnut Hill
recruiting station a few miles from home.

774
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,874
- Did Colonel John tell you this?
- No.

775
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:44,918
Please don't ask me any more,
but it's true, believe me.

776
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:46,782
What do you think I ought to do?

777
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:49,982
Go home to him, of course.
The stagecoach leaves in the morning...

778
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,093
...and you'll be home within a week.

779
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,819
That's what I thought.

780
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,487
You'd do anything
to get rid of me, wouldn't you?

781
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,497
- Erin, you don't think...
- Yes, I do.

782
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,898
I'd put nothing past you,
the way you've acted...

783
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,901
...none of your friends understand you.

784
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,404
Even Colonel John
won't talk to me about you.

785
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:09,170
- Erin, listen to me...
- Let go of me. Now get out.

786
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:12,280
And don't come creeping back
to me with any of your tricks.

787
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:16,384
I'm staying here until Colonel John
tells me my son's been found.

788
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,116
I hope it'll be soon.

789
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,956
I hope many things will be soon.

790
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:23,955
Get out.

791
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,223
Get out!

792
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:42,204
- Mrs. Kearny to see you, sir.
- Oh, send her in, sergeant.

793
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,039
Yes, sir. Mrs. Kearny.

794
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,340
I was thinking about you
this moment, my dear.

795
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:49,313
I've just received a long,
official document from Washington.

796
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:54,252
Which translated into one sentence says
"Young James Kearny has been found."

797
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,815
Oh, Colonel John.

798
01:04:56,993 --> 01:05:00,394
Well, he's in the best of health.
Army grub seems to agree with him.

799
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,691
- So it's true.
- Well, what's the matter, Erin?

800
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:07,302
Lex came to see me last night
to tell me Jamie's been found.

801
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:10,871
I didn't believe him. I sent him away.

802
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,905
How did Lex know about Jamie?

803
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:16,841
I don't know, he wouldn't tell me, that's
one of the reasons I didn't believe him.

804
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,709
He acted so strange,
so mysterious about everything.

805
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:23,283
That's why I came to you.
I thought you could see him, talk to him...

806
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:26,615
...and get him to stop
this thing he's doing, whatever it is.

807
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:29,758
Erin, you worried for weeks
about Jamie, didn't you?

808
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,655
It didn't help matters any, did it?

809
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:34,523
He was found, and all your worries
were for nothing.

810
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:36,790
Now, you know what I'd do
if I were you?

811
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:39,167
I think you
ought to go home to your son.

812
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:42,270
This is a man's world out here,
and you don't belong.

813
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,133
But just remember this...

814
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:46,901
...people don't always act
the way you expect them to.

815
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:50,978
It doesn't mean that they aren't
fond of you or they don't love you.

816
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:56,608
It simply means they may have a star to
follow that's stronger than any personal tie.

817
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:00,814
Colonel John, I don't know
what I would have done without you.

818
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:04,255
Now run along, my dear.

819
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,928
- Good morning, John.
- Good morning, George.

820
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:46,693
- When did you get back?
- Last night.

821
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:48,962
It was late,
I didn't want to roust you out.

822
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:51,504
I congratulate you
on that herd getting through.

823
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,335
Everyone in Washington is elated.

824
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,000
- It was a surprise, wasn't it?
- It certainly was.

825
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,204
Mind if I use your telegrapher?
I'd like to wire General Halleck.

826
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:01,282
Well, help yourself.

827
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:04,350
- Ramsey?
- Yes, sir.

828
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:41,922
Colonel.

829
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:46,194
I was just getting ready
to bring you some horses.

830
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:50,293
Yes, I know. You almost had me,
didn't you, Lex?

831
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:54,565
I'm afraid I don't understand.

832
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:58,298
You were out to get me, but by a
rare stroke of fortune, I got you first.

833
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:02,240
It's the accidental things that sometimes
change the course of history, isn't it?

834
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:05,539
For instance, if you hadn't told Erin
that Jamie had been found...

835
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:08,444
...our positions might be reversed.

836
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:11,916
- I still don't understand.
- You made a mistake.

837
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,751
Your information about Jamie could
only have come from George Sharpe.

838
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,756
And he made a mistake too.

839
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,385
He called Ramsey by name, when by
all odds, he should never had known him.

840
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:23,498
What does all this prove, colonel?

841
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:27,363
Nothing. But I got curious.
I took Ramsey riding with me yesterday.

842
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:29,504
We happened to run on to Pete Elm.

843
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:32,163
As you said, he has his uses.

844
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:33,706
Ramsey talked.

845
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:37,676
One of the things he admitted was that they
know nothing about you in Washington.

846
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:41,078
You're doing this thing alone.
Against orders.

847
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,947
All you've got to do is get rid of me,
and you're in the clear?

848
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:47,521
Yes. Raise your hands.

849
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,183
Stand up.

850
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:56,296
Face that wall.

851
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:11,837
Open that door.

852
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,188
Colonel Sharpe?

853
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:23,154
Yeah. And that gin-pot bartender...

854
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:26,158
...and your trooper friend
Ferguson are pushing up daisies.

855
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:29,161
- Just like you're gonna be if l...
- Hold it, Elm.

856
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:33,028
I'm sorry this had to happen, Lex.
Good men fall when mistakes are made.

857
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:35,136
Nothing gained,
and all of them dead now.

858
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:37,204
You're in an unusual predicament.

859
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,637
One that can be of great service to me.

860
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:42,641
You're a Northern agent,
but nobody's alive to prove it.

861
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:45,678
With your record, everyone believes you
are a Southern agent.

862
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,213
I'll have to hang you for that
in the morning.

863
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,852
That and the murder of Colonel Sharpe.

864
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,420
Then our clever Mr. Quint
can report to Washington...

865
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:56,217
...that the rebel spy ring
has been smashed...

866
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:59,122
...and its leader, you, executed.

867
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:02,162
That will leave me free
to go on taking your horses.

868
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:05,823
And when the spring comes, instead
of the North mounting an offensive...

869
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,866
...it'll be the South.

870
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:09,901
I'm sorry, Lex.

871
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:12,035
Get going.

872
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,725
Are they starting the drive today?

873
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:35,455
Kind of wish you were in them hills
to stop it, don't you, Copperhead?

874
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,784
Open up the door, guard.

875
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:34,587
I'm supposed to ask you
if there's anything you want.

876
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:36,486
Is there anything you want?

877
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:40,390
- Let's get at it.
- Turn around. Hands behind you.

878
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:56,806
Sweet dreams, Copperhead.

879
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,413
At trail. Right, left, face.

880
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,572
Forward.

881
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,796
Detail, halt!

882
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:23,070
We'll have to go in with you, sir.

883
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:45,890
- You'll all be court-martialed for this.
- Yes, sir. Follow me.

884
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,261
Get in the wagon.

885
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:08,842
- Go to the warehouse.
- Sir, our plans were to go north...

886
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:11,281
...into the hills.
- We gotta stop the drive...

887
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:13,683
...before it's shot up.
Follow trail of the herd.

888
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:16,290
- Major Kearny...
- There's new Springfield rifles...

889
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,483
...in the warehouse.
Enough for the troop.

890
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,424
If we get them in time,
we'll have a chance.

891
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:47,152
Never exactly doubted you, sir.

892
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:50,951
That raw deal they gave you at your
court-martial gave us a pain in the collar.

893
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,856
Where do you suppose it gave me a pain?

894
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:57,588
What's going on around here, major?
We can't figure it out.

895
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,496
It's lucky for me
you figured out what you did.

896
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:02,794
There's no time to go into details...

897
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:05,337
...but I'm working to uncover
the rebel spy leader.

898
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:09,273
And the trouble is it turned out to be our
own commanding officer Colonel Hudson.

899
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,913
- Colonel Hudson?
- Yes, but he'll be taken care of.

900
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:16,073
We've got to stop an ambush and keep
the lieutenant's men from being cut down.

901
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:17,808
What can the six of us do, sir?

902
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:22,082
If these rifles are everything Colonel Sharpe
hoped for, we'll have plenty of firepower.

903
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:27,194
No more muzzle loading. Breaks open at the
breach like this. Cartridge is inserted here.

904
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:31,124
When fired, it ejects the empty.

905
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:35,870
Load and fire in a matter of seconds.
That's all there is to it.

906
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:38,162
Let's get moving.

907
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,082
What are you doing here, Private Larsen?

908
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:25,049
Oh, mess sergeant sent me down
to pick up some rations.

909
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,484
- See Sergeant Snow and Kearny?
- Prisoner?

910
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:30,853
Yeah, the prisoner Kearny.
He's escaped.

911
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,687
No, sir.

912
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,663
- Who's that from back there?
- Me, sergeant.

913
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:39,733
I'm just wrestling the hardtack boxes.
I'll take beans any day.

914
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,734
Horses to gallop!

915
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,299
Watch out for yourselves!

916
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:47,184
Hold them.

917
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:56,931
Bring the rifles down.

918
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,145
Sergeant, Lieutenant Johnson.

919
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:13,018
It's like we had all our trouble for nothing.
We're too late.

920
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:17,591
Maybe not. First go over and straighten out
Lieutenant Johnson about me.

921
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:25,490
Sir, we were coming to help you.

922
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:28,534
- Major Kearny's in command.
- Major Kearny?

923
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,763
Yes, Major Kearny, lieutenant.

924
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:33,908
If you want that one bar on your shoulder
to turn into two...

925
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:36,101
...I suggest you hear me out.

926
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:40,611
Sir, the lieutenant may not believe him.
We might as well be going back anyway.

927
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:43,080
We won't be going back, Olie.

928
01:18:57,165 --> 01:19:01,397
- I'm sorry we weren't in time, lieutenant.
- What are your orders, sir?

929
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,970
Equip every man that can ride
with these new rifles.

930
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:07,734
We're going to the south fork of Bear Creek
and get your herd back.

931
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:50,814
Dismount.

932
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:54,779
- Riley, get the rifles and ammunition.
- Yes, sir.

933
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:58,585
Sergeant Snow, lieutenant,
come with me.

934
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,183
Seems like everybody's here today.

935
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:31,655
There's Colonel Hudson
with my green jacket.

936
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:35,991
Now, this is the only way they can get out,
and we can catch them in our crossfire.

937
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:39,065
You go back and bring up the first section
on this side.

938
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:41,395
You deploy the second section
on the far side.

939
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,801
And a shot from me will be the signal
to open fire.

940
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:47,635
Colonel, instruct your men
not to shoot at Colonel Hudson.

941
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:50,209
I want him brought back
with every hair on his head.

942
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,505
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

943
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:33,811
How'd you let a thing like that happen,
colonel?

944
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:37,720
Kearny had help. Probably on his way
to Washington right now.

945
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,760
My usefulness at the fort is finished.

946
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:46,532
Well, it would take about a week
to plant someone in your place.

947
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:48,293
Can't let the Yankees have horses.

948
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:43,150
There must be a couple hundred men
up there.

949
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:46,055
Somehow they got hold of
those new Springfield rifles.

950
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,889
I guess Kearny didn't go to Washington.

951
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:31,730
We'll have to wait until dark
if we're going to get out of here.

952
01:23:31,906 --> 01:23:34,466
Cease fire!

953
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,445
Cease firing.

954
01:23:39,914 --> 01:23:42,883
- Cease firing.
- These things get hot, sir.

955
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:48,014
- Hold your fire.
- I feel like a whole army, sir.

956
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:54,251
- Hold your fire.
- We got them trapped all right, major.

957
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:02,033
They can stay under cover
of those trees all day...

958
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:06,230
...and they can slip out tonight.
We got to smoke them out of there.

959
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:10,777
That's right, major, we'll smoke them out.
With your permission, sir.

960
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:13,573
- All right, sergeant.
- Hamel.

961
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:17,884
Torch some brush,
and we'll put it on the wagon.

962
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:23,315
It's gonna be a beautiful fire, major.

963
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:09,325
They'll be coming out soon.

964
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:31,409
- Get your men ready.
- Yes, sir.

965
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:38,792
You should have let me finish Kearny
when we had him.

966
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,987
I can't say I disagree with you, Pete.
Your hindsight is great.

967
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:45,049
It's Colonel Hudson.

968
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:37,460
Why don't you shoot me
and be done with it?

969
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:41,659
I need you for living proof
that five good men didn't die in vain.

970
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:49,643
Present!

971
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:56,743
Major Kearny...

972
01:30:57,318 --> 01:30:59,718
...sometimes it may appear
that the Army is blind...

973
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:01,320
...to new methods of operation.

974
01:31:01,489 --> 01:31:05,323
That's because we are dealing with
countless lives placed in our trust.

975
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:07,518
Fortunately, in times of emergency...

976
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:10,493
...men arise with a brand of courage
and fortitude...

977
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:15,693
...that go far beyond the call of duty,
and you are one of these.

978
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:18,703
And so were Colonel Sharpe,
Captain Tennick...

979
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:22,434
...and those other brave men
who willingly sacrificed their lives.

980
01:31:27,348 --> 01:31:28,610
Major Kearny...

981
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:32,985
...you have been returned to duty with the
commendation of the general...

982
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:35,179
...of the Army of the Republic.

983
01:31:35,356 --> 01:31:37,483
And I'm recommending
that you be transferred...

984
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:41,389
...to head the newly-formed Department
of Military Intelligence in Washington.

985
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:42,859
However...

986
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:46,659
...the most important accomplishment
that came out of this entire operation...

987
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:49,997
...was your successful demonstration
of an experimental weapon.

988
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:52,071
You proved on the field of action...

989
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,209
...its superior effectiveness
over our older firearms.

990
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:59,540
And as a result, the Springfield rifle
has been made standard equipment...

991
01:31:59,714 --> 01:32:01,909
