1
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:30,447
BLACK ROBE

2
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:01,765
The Indians, who
went to flangis,

3
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,371
thought there was
a city of gold ...

4
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:07,882
QUEBEC, NORTEAMERlCA, 1634

5
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,578
In the South there is a city of gold.

6
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:11,847
My brother saw it.

7
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:17,484
Tramblé.

8
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,118
Look at these, Tramblé.

9
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,028
"Where did you trap them,
Sainte Marie"?

10
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:25,590
In the forest.

11
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:27,363
It's my secret, Tramblé.

12
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:30,098
And how do you pay the
Indian trappers?

13
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:32,971
With knives, Father.
With cooking pots.

14
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:35,875
With Brandy and Whiskey, I am told.
With Brandy.


15
00:02:43,185 --> 00:02:45,949
And what if there is no mission?

16
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:47,955
What if your father Laforgue arrives ...


17
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:50,287
to find yet another
two Jesuit martyrs?

18
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:52,816
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

19
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:54,158
It's not we.

20
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:56,426
It's Father Laforgue 
who must cross it.

21
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,930
Has he journeyed far from this settlement?

22
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,333
"Even in good weather?"

23
00:03:03,672 --> 00:03:06,937
He has been studying the Huron and 
Algonquin languages.

24
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:09,739
He is very dedicated and devot.

25
00:03:09,778 --> 00:03:10,972
Of course.

26
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,978
Even I have been on these
journeys, Monsieur Champlain ...

27
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:19,517
from the lakes of Hurons
to the rivers of Maine.

28
00:03:19,554 --> 00:03:22,250
- And now ...
- We are too old.

29
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,283
- Perhaps, Younger men are more suitable --
- Perhaps. Perhaps not.


30
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:35,760
1500 miles by canoe ...

31
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:37,829
in that country,

32
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:39,704
at the beginning of the winter ...

33
00:03:41,643 --> 00:03:44,009
Death is almost certain,
Father Bourque.

34
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:47,446
Death is not always
a great evil, Monsieur Champlain.

35
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,183
God should have made me a Jesuit,
to have answers for everything.


36
00:04:08,236 --> 00:04:11,171
He must paddle with them
12 hours a day,

37
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:13,197
or they will not respect him.


38
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:16,142
he must smile
and not show anger.

39
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:19,705
He must carry a pack animals loads 
on his back as they do.

40
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:23,980
The journey, like our 
lives is in God's hands.

41
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,452
Look at them. The English
and the Dutch are colonists.

42
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:35,724
We have priests.

43
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:38,959
Who would want to bring a woman here.



44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,094
and have kids running half
wild in the woods?

45
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:44,128
We are Starving
in winter..

46
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:49,376
- Good afternoon, father.
- Good afternoon.

47
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:50,673
Good afternoon, Father.

48
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:56,884
- Do you think they're going upriver?
- Who cares?

49
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:58,283
As long as I am not going.

50
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,754
Leave the forest
to the savages.

51
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:04,623
Remember that priest
who came back like that?.

52
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:07,059
It was the Iroquois.
They caught him.

53
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:09,256
That was just fingers.

54
00:05:09,297 --> 00:05:11,788
One might lose something, that is more useful.

55
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:40,617


56
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,218



57
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:46,352


58
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:16,849
Why do you want to accompany
Father Laforgue?

59
00:07:19,227 --> 00:07:22,253
For the
greater glory of God.

60
00:07:22,297 --> 00:07:23,355
Indeed?

61
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:27,096
I am told you're bored
in this settlement.

62
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:29,897
Sometimes. A little.

63
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,738
To come all this way
and to just build huts ...


64
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:36,175
I understand.

65
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:39,672
Can you read and write?


66
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:43,711
Yes, Father. I was taught by my uncle,
who was a priest in Tour.

67
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,951


68
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:48,683


69
00:07:49,424 --> 00:07:51,415
He speaks it more fluently than I do.

70
00:07:54,262 --> 00:07:56,753
If we send you and if ...

71
00:07:56,798 --> 00:07:58,265
when you return ...

72
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:02,694
you could go to France, to
study for the priesthood,

73
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:04,136
Would that please you, Daniel?

74
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:07,807
Yes, Father.

75
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:40,033


76
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:48,134
These are our Fathers.

77
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:52,366
They are soldiers of Heaven.

78
00:10:52,407 --> 00:10:55,035
They left their friends
and their country ...

79
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:57,636
to show you
the way to Paradise.

80
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:09,786
Chomin ...

81
00:11:09,824 --> 00:11:12,884
I entrust to you Father Laforgue.


82
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:18,732
Who is journeying into the land
of Herots.

83
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:22,529
Love and honor him.

84
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,003
Guard him well.

85
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:22,629
Look at him, dressed like 
a savage Chieftan.

86
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:24,427
We are not colonizeing the Indians.

87
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:27,229
- They are colonizeing us.
- Not me, they are not.


88
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:30,465
I am not becomeing one
of those wild woods men.

89
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:33,338
In one more year, I am going back to France.

90
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:34,807
How are you?

91
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:36,400
Are any of us?

92
00:12:36,444 --> 00:12:39,436
If winter doesn't kill us,
the Indians might.

93
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,040
If they don't,
it could be the English.

94
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,516
So keep your faith.

95
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:46,213
I made that point
with you, God in mind.

96
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:36,075
Good morning

97
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:37,778
You are?

98
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:41,219
- Paul Laforgue.
- You have to serve my mass?

99
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:44,483
I am the priest of New France.

100
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:48,455
The savages did this to me.

101
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:51,090
"Indians"? But why?

102
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,724
They are uncivilized,

103
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,860
just as the English
or the Germans were ...

104
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:56,460
before we took our faith to them.

105
00:16:57,738 --> 00:17:00,036
In
a few weeks ...


106
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:01,871
I will be returing.

107
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:03,501
Returning to New France?

108
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:06,980
The savages live
in total darkness.


109
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:08,982
We must convert them.

110
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:12,452
What more glorious task
than that, Paul.

111
00:17:12,486 --> 00:17:14,852
What more glorious task.

112
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:10,407


113
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:12,537


114
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:16,083


115
00:18:16,117 --> 00:18:17,482


116
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,445


117
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:24,083


118
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,151


119
00:18:28,663 --> 00:18:30,324


120
00:18:31,966 --> 00:18:34,560


121
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:37,867


122
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:53,746


123
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:22,807
Black Robe, what are you doing?



124
00:19:24,118 --> 00:19:25,517
I'm making words.

125
00:19:26,554 --> 00:19:27,748
"Words"?


126
00:19:28,856 --> 00:19:30,448
You do not speak.

127
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:32,923
I'll show you.

128
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:38,189
- Tell me something.
- Tell What?

129
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:40,598
Something I do not know.

130
00:19:44,238 --> 00:19:47,537
My woman's mother...

131
00:19:47,575 --> 00:19:49,907
died in snow
last winter.

132
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:25,039
''Last winter, Chomin's wife mother...


133
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,876
died in the snow''.''

134
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:48,358
I have still other greater things
that I can teach you.


135
00:21:03,451 --> 00:21:05,351


136
00:22:03,143 --> 00:22:04,838
Father ...

137
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:07,211
I did not mean any disrespect ...

138
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:10,342
but do you have any doubts?

139
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:12,982
What about?

140
00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:16,980
Them ... these people.

141
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:20,494
If we change them.

142
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:24,157
If we do not change them,
How could they enter Heaven?

143
00:22:24,198 --> 00:22:27,224
Intelligence is not lacking
among these people.

144
00:22:28,903 --> 00:22:31,269
He speaks only
Algonquin, father.

145
00:22:34,675 --> 00:22:35,972


146
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:41,974


147
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:44,348



148
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:46,046


149
00:22:46,086 --> 00:22:48,816


150
00:22:48,856 --> 00:22:52,690



151
00:22:57,064 --> 00:22:58,827
What is the meaning of that word?

152
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:04,070
You love that tobacco,
more than you love us.

153
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,595
What can I do? I know that.

154
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,403
he will ask and ask until they have ...

155
00:23:08,442 --> 00:23:10,672
everything, we brought with us.


156
00:23:10,711 --> 00:23:14,044
Father, they do not understand.

157
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:16,481
They share everything
without question.

158
00:23:16,517 --> 00:23:18,451
Then they should question.

159
00:23:18,485 --> 00:23:20,953
They plan nothing,
but think only of the moment:

160
00:23:20,988 --> 00:23:22,455
hunting, eating, forn --

161
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:30,597
Go and get the tobacco, Daniel.

162
00:25:30,384 --> 00:25:34,650
They say it's soothing
once you become used to it.

163
00:25:48,368 --> 00:25:50,666
That may take some time.

164
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:52,228


165
00:25:52,272 --> 00:25:56,072


166
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,874


167
00:25:58,912 --> 00:26:01,847


168
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,181



169
00:26:04,218 --> 00:26:07,449



170
00:26:13,894 --> 00:26:16,089
They don't seem to be very happy father.

171
00:26:17,164 --> 00:26:20,327
They should be.
I have told them the truth.

172
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,111


173
00:26:40,154 --> 00:26:43,521


174
00:26:43,557 --> 00:26:45,047


175
00:26:45,092 --> 00:26:47,890


176
00:26:50,898 --> 00:26:54,356


177
00:26:54,401 --> 00:26:56,062


178
00:26:57,337 --> 00:26:59,362


179
00:26:59,406 --> 00:27:01,636
.

180
00:27:24,097 --> 00:27:27,692
So charming, 
Mademoiselle Lafontaine.

181
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:29,634
And so attractive.

182
00:27:31,471 --> 00:27:33,063
So modest.

183
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:36,873
She is from a very good family.

184
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:03,453


185
00:30:04,524 --> 00:30:08,756


186
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:14,258


187
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:16,861


188
00:30:16,903 --> 00:30:18,803


189
00:31:58,038 --> 00:31:59,665


190
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,303


191

What do you think they
are talking about, father?

229
00:35:39,826 --> 00:35:41,316
I don't know.

230
00:35:41,361 --> 00:35:42,521
Of us?

248
00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:34,026
Mother, what are you doing?

249
00:38:35,635 --> 00:38:37,193
Praying to Saint Joan.

250
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:42,867
Perhaps God has chosen you
as he chose her.

251
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:46,276
You must not compare me
to a saint, Mother.

252
00:38:46,312 --> 00:38:50,214
"In New France, you will remember me 
in your prayers?

253
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,649
I always do..

254
00:38:53,286 --> 00:38:55,447
God will hear your prayer.

255
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,048
He has chosen you
to die for Him.

256
00:39:00,326 --> 00:39:02,988
I will never see you again.

257
00:40:20,306 --> 00:40:22,206

258
00:40:26,813 --> 00:40:30,180

260
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:44,353
I'm afraid, Lord.

261
00:40:46,165 --> 00:40:48,360
I don't welcome death ...

262
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:50,426
as a holy person should.

263
00:41:19,332 --> 00:41:22,733


264
00:41:22,769 --> 00:41:24,293

00:42:43,483 --> 00:42:44,643
Daniel?

272
00:42:52,825 --> 00:42:55,385
I too have committed
the sin of the flesh.

273
00:42:55,428 --> 00:42:57,225
Do you, father?

274
00:42:57,263 --> 00:42:59,561
"In France, long ago"?

275
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,089
No, here.

276
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:04,292
Sin of intent.

277
00:43:04,337 --> 00:43:05,861
Here.

278
00:43:05,905 --> 00:43:07,532
I've lusted after her.

279
00:43:09,108 --> 00:43:10,905
Kneel with me ...

280
00:43:10,943 --> 00:43:13,002
and say an act of contrition.

281
00:43:13,045 --> 00:43:17,505
Father, Life is not so simple
for the rest of us.

282
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,211
I am not a Jesuit.

283
00:43:19,252 --> 00:43:21,413
You said you wanted to
serve God.

284
00:43:21,454 --> 00:43:23,251
Yes, Father, but I ...

285
00:43:28,828 --> 00:43:31,388
I'm afraid of this country.

286
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,955
The Devil rules here.

287
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,128
Controls the hearts
and minds ...

288
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,967
of these poor people.

289
00:43:39,005 --> 00:43:44,204
But they are true Christians,
they live for each other.

290
00:43:44,243 --> 00:43:46,939
They forgive things,
we would not forgive.

291
00:43:46,979 --> 00:43:50,278
The Devil makes them resist
the truth of our teachings.

292
00:43:50,316 --> 00:43:52,477
Why should they believe them?

293
00:43:52,518 --> 00:43:54,782
They have an after world of
their own.

294
00:43:54,821 --> 00:43:56,982
They have no concept of one.


295
00:43:57,023 --> 00:43:59,821
Annuka has told me ...

296
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:03,920
they believe that, in the forest at night,
the dead can see.


297
00:44:03,963 --> 00:44:08,059
Souls of men hunt
the souls of animals.

298
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:12,161
"Is that what she told you?"
It's childish, Daniel.

299
00:44:12,205 --> 00:44:14,935
Is it harder to believe
in a paradise ...

300
00:44:14,974 --> 00:44:17,067
where we all sit on the clouds with a good God?

301
00:44:49,075 --> 00:44:51,168


302
00:44:53,946 --> 00:44:56,039


303
00:44:56,082 --> 00:44:59,813


304
00:44:59,852 --> 00:45:03,618


305
00:45:03,656 --> 00:45:05,988


306
00:45:06,025 --> 00:45:09,290


307
00:45:09,328 --> 00:45:11,888


308
00:45:11,931 --> 00:45:13,796


309
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:18,067


310
00:45:18,104 --> 00:45:20,129


311
00:45:20,172 --> 00:45:22,231

00:47:21,927 --> 00:47:23,588

319
00:47:24,663 --> 00:47:26,460


320
00:47:28,701 --> 00:47:31,169
Oh, God of mercy...

321
00:47:31,203 --> 00:47:34,297
Please, Bless
this innocent child.

322
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,705


323
00:47:36,709 --> 00:47:38,609


324
00:47:47,686 --> 00:47:51,554

331
00:48:31,864 --> 00:48:34,128
Where are my paddlers?
You promised.


332
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:47,236
You go with your own mission
to the Hurons, alone, Black Robe.

333
00:48:47,279 --> 00:48:50,646
Ask your Jesus, to help you,
Black Robe.

334
00:50:58,277 --> 00:51:00,177

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,742

00:53:15,783 --> 00:53:19,742


352
00:53:19,787 --> 00:53:23,689


353
00:53:23,724 --> 00:53:26,750


354
00:53:26,794 --> 00:53:30,127


355
00:53:38,939 --> 00:53:41,032

00:53:41,075 --> 00:53:42,975

00:54:24,151 --> 00:54:27,587


358
00:54:27,621 --> 00:54:31,819


359
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,170
Lord ...

360
00:54:52,446 --> 00:54:56,143
If it be Thy wish that
I suffer greater tribulations

361
00:54:56,183 --> 00:54:58,811
in the days ahead ...

362
00:54:58,852 --> 00:55:00,877
I welcome it.

363
00:55:02,122 --> 00:55:05,649
Thou has given me this cross
for thy honor ...

364
00:55:05,692 --> 00:55:08,957
for the salvation
of these poor barbarians.

365
00:55:10,464 --> 00:55:11,954
I thank Thee.

366
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:45,381
Father, Forgive me.

367
01:01:45,425 --> 01:01:46,619
What for?

368
01:01:48,195 --> 01:01:50,026
For the things I said to you.

369
01:01:51,531 --> 01:01:53,362
For leaving you.

370
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,836
God is with us.
He is the one who forgives us.

371
01:05:52,472 --> 01:05:53,461
Sing.

372
01:05:54,441 --> 01:05:55,601
Sing!

373
01:07:20,093 --> 01:07:24,325


374
01:07:24,364 --> 01:07:28,926


375
01:07:53,326 --> 01:07:55,351
The arrowhead is still there

376
01:07:55,395 --> 01:07:57,386
If we try
to remove it, you will die.

377
01:08:00,366 --> 01:08:02,834
You want to be one of us?

378
01:08:02,869 --> 01:08:04,962
What do you think now?

379
01:08:05,004 --> 01:08:08,565
The Iroquois are not men.
They are animals.

380
01:08:08,608 --> 01:08:12,442
They're the same as us
or Hurons.

381
01:08:12,478 --> 01:08:16,380
If they showed pity, others
will say that they are weak.

382
01:08:19,352 --> 01:08:20,910
Tomorrow ...

383
01:08:20,954 --> 01:08:22,478
do not cry out.

384
01:08:24,023 --> 01:08:26,287
If we do cry out, "Will they stop?"

385
01:08:26,326 --> 01:08:28,692
No, They would not stop.

386
01:08:29,696 --> 01:08:32,722
But if you cry out when you die,

387
01:08:32,765 --> 01:08:34,824
they will
have your spirit.

388
01:08:34,867 --> 01:08:37,461
When I die, Chomin,
I will go to Paradise.

389
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:40,165
Let me baptize you
so you will go there also.

390
01:08:40,206 --> 01:08:42,674
Why would I go to your paradise?

391
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:44,609
Are my people there?

392
01:08:44,644 --> 01:08:49,138
"My wife? My son? There's 
only Black Robes there".

393
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:54,642


394
01:08:56,356 --> 01:08:59,382


395
01:08:59,425 --> 01:09:02,019


396
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:03,892


397
01:09:05,765 --> 01:09:09,223


398
01:09:09,268 --> 01:09:10,599


399
01:09:11,804 --> 01:09:14,773


400
01:09:14,807 --> 01:09:20,302


401
01:09:20,346 --> 01:09:25,579


402
01:09:25,618 --> 01:09:27,085


403
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,850


404
01:09:29,889 --> 01:09:32,414


405
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:34,289


406
01:09:34,327 --> 01:09:38,855


407
01:10:20,707 --> 01:10:22,106


408
01:12:36,409 --> 01:12:38,570


409
01:12:39,712 --> 01:12:41,111


410
01:14:22,515 --> 01:14:24,540
We go downstream 
to my people.

411
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,778
No, We go upstream
to the Huron mission.

412
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:29,117


413
01:14:29,155 --> 01:14:31,749
You're so weak, The Iroquois
could easily catch you.

414
01:14:31,791 --> 01:14:34,624
And they would not expect you
to travel away from your people.

415
01:14:37,129 --> 01:14:39,563
You're not so stupid, Black Robe.

416
01:16:01,113 --> 01:16:04,105
Lord, I beg you ...

417
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:06,675
show your mercy
to these savage people ...


418
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:09,779
who will never look upon Your face
in Paradise.

419
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:39,794
Tell me, Black Robe ...


420
01:18:40,806 --> 01:18:42,706
What does your dreams see now?

421
01:18:43,809 --> 01:18:45,709
I'm too weary for dreams.

422
01:18:46,879 --> 01:18:49,074
But you must.

423
01:18:49,114 --> 01:18:52,777
If you do not ... how do you see
the way that lies ahead?

424
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:56,279
I trust in God.

425
01:18:56,322 --> 01:18:58,984
He will guide me ...
all the way to Paradise.

426
01:19:00,192 --> 01:19:02,956
You have not seen this paradise.

427
01:19:04,096 --> 01:19:06,223
No man should
welcome death.

428
01:19:07,233 --> 01:19:09,633
This world is a cruel place ...

429
01:19:10,769 --> 01:19:13,431
but it has the sunlight.

430
01:19:15,941 --> 01:19:18,273
I'm sorry that I should leave now.


431
01:19:26,885 --> 01:19:29,410


432
01:19:30,322 --> 01:19:31,880



433
01:19:31,924 --> 01:19:33,289

434
01:19:34,493 --> 01:19:38,020


435
01:19:38,063 --> 01:19:40,395


436
01:19:42,635 --> 01:19:47,402


437
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:49,566


438
01:19:49,608 --> 01:19:54,944


439
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,447


440
01:19:59,251 --> 01:20:01,549


441
01:20:01,587 --> 01:20:05,648


442
01:20:05,691 --> 01:20:08,251


443
01:20:09,461 --> 01:20:11,156


444
01:20:12,765 --> 01:20:17,168


445
01:20:25,077 --> 01:20:26,977


446
01:20:28,747 --> 01:20:31,807
Chomin, do you hear me?
My God loves you.

447
01:20:36,055 --> 01:20:40,185


448
01:20:40,225 --> 01:20:43,626
If you accept His love,
he will admit you to Paradise.

449
01:20:45,664 --> 01:20:48,861


450
01:20:48,901 --> 01:20:52,997


451
01:20:53,038 --> 01:20:56,405


452
01:20:58,410 --> 01:21:01,573


453
01:23:54,953 --> 01:23:57,080


454
01:23:57,122 --> 01:23:59,113


455
01:24:00,392 --> 01:24:04,328



456
01:24:04,363 --> 01:24:07,025


457
01:24:08,166 --> 01:24:11,158


458
01:24:15,507 --> 01:24:17,168
"I'll go with you, Father".

459
01:24:19,411 --> 01:24:21,242
You must stay with her.

460
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,339
She has lost everything
because of us.

461
01:24:24,349 --> 01:24:25,873
She needs you more than I do.

462
01:24:27,052 --> 01:24:30,021


463
01:24:30,055 --> 01:24:32,683
We will do what she ask.


464
01:24:32,724 --> 01:24:36,023
What can we say to people who thinks 
that dreams are the real world...

465
01:24:36,061 --> 01:24:39,155
and this one is an illusion?


466
01:24:40,566 --> 01:24:42,158
Perhaps they're right.


467
01:24:44,069 --> 01:24:46,230
Good bye, Father Laforgue.


468
01:24:46,271 --> 01:24:48,102
No Farewells,

469
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:49,630
not in this land

470
01:24:49,675 --> 01:24:52,542
and no greetings,
no names.

471
01:24:52,578 --> 01:24:54,569
The forests speak.


472
01:24:54,613 --> 01:24:57,104
The dead talk at night.

473
01:24:57,149 --> 01:24:58,844
God bless you both.

474
01:27:24,896 --> 01:27:26,056
Father?

475
01:27:40,512 --> 01:27:41,911
Who are you?

476
01:27:42,914 --> 01:27:44,814
I'm Father Laforgue.

477
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:46,147
How many are with you?

478
01:27:47,152 --> 01:27:48,380
I am alone.

479
01:27:53,792 --> 01:27:57,728
Some months ago
that fever struck this village.

480
01:27:57,763 --> 01:28:00,391
The Indians thought that 
we brought it to punish ...

481
01:28:00,432 --> 01:28:02,263
those who would not accept our faith.

482
01:28:03,268 --> 01:28:05,395
Many died.

483
01:28:05,437 --> 01:28:09,635
One man who lost his child
killed father Duval.

484
01:28:10,575 --> 01:28:12,167
What are they all doing now?

485
01:28:13,445 --> 01:28:16,380
Who knows
what the savages will do?


486
01:28:16,414 --> 01:28:18,746
Who knows
what they think?

487
01:28:18,784 --> 01:28:24,347
Even after 20 years,
I still do not understand them.
 

488
01:28:24,389 --> 01:28:26,983
They would probably torture
and kill us both.

489
01:28:29,461 --> 01:28:31,429
But what about those
converts?

490
01:28:31,463 --> 01:28:33,055
We must have some influence.

491
01:28:33,098 --> 01:28:37,330
Converts?
Perhaps, There are no converts.

492
01:28:37,369 --> 01:28:41,635
Our only hope
is that ... some believe ...

493
01:28:41,673 --> 01:28:44,437
that baptism will
cure their fever.

494
01:28:45,677 --> 01:28:48,202
If they ask for baptism,

495
01:28:48,246 --> 01:28:50,874
we must have a great 
public ceremony at once. 

496
01:28:52,484 --> 01:28:53,610
Father Jerome ...

497
01:28:54,753 --> 01:28:56,448
Shouldn't we ...?

498
01:28:56,488 --> 01:28:58,683
I mean ...

499
01:28:58,723 --> 01:29:01,385
Should they not understand our faith ...

500
01:29:01,426 --> 01:29:02,859
before accepting it?

501
01:29:02,894 --> 01:29:04,691
Understand?

502
01:29:04,729 --> 01:29:07,095
But they are in danger of  death...

503
01:29:07,132 --> 01:29:10,590
and we are offering them
a place in Paradise.

504
01:29:44,269 --> 01:29:48,603


505
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,632


506
01:29:51,676 --> 01:29:53,200

507
01:29:54,846 --> 01:29:58,646


508
01:29:58,683 --> 01:30:02,483


509
01:30:06,324 --> 01:30:10,317


510
01:30:10,362 --> 01:30:13,092


511
01:30:13,131 --> 01:30:16,259


512
01:30:16,301 --> 01:30:20,499


513
01:30:20,538 --> 01:30:23,666


514
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:26,074


515
01:31:32,410 --> 01:31:35,811
Father death
may be near.

516
01:31:35,847 --> 01:31:37,781
Will you hear my confession?


517
01:31:39,517 --> 01:31:41,542
If you will hear mine.

518
01:31:49,995 --> 01:31:52,486
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

519
01:32:28,366 --> 01:32:30,095
Lord ...

520
01:32:30,135 --> 01:32:33,263
Why is Father Jerome
is with you in Heaven ...

521
01:32:33,304 --> 01:32:36,467
while Chomin lies
forever in utter darkness?

522
01:32:38,443 --> 01:32:39,933
Help me.

523
01:33:11,609 --> 01:33:13,543
Demon!
Why are you here?.

524
01:33:14,579 --> 01:33:16,547
I am not a Demon.

525
01:33:16,581 --> 01:33:19,106
I take the place of Father Jérome.


526
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:22,278
- Is he dead?
- Yes

527
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,083
How long will you stay?


528
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:26,650
All of my life.

529
01:33:27,759 --> 01:33:30,387
If we take the
water sorcery ...

530
01:33:30,428 --> 01:33:31,861
We will not be sick?

531
01:33:33,131 --> 01:33:35,725
Baptism does not cure you.

532
01:33:35,767 --> 01:33:38,395
The other Black Robe said so.

533
01:33:38,436 --> 01:33:42,395
He meant only that
we must ask the help of Jesus.

534
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:44,931
Perhaps, He will answer your prayers.

535
01:34:11,703 --> 01:34:13,671
Many want to kill you,
Black Robe.

536
01:34:15,707 --> 01:34:16,867
I know.

537
01:34:26,484 --> 01:34:28,452
A Demon cannot feel pain.

538
01:34:29,821 --> 01:34:31,118
Are you a Man?

539
01:34:33,525 --> 01:34:35,322
Yes

540
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,385
You must help us, Black Robe.

541
01:34:38,396 --> 01:34:40,296
Do you love us?

542
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:09,423
- Yes
- Then, Baptize us.

543
01:35:16,634 --> 01:35:18,192
Spare them.

544
01:35:18,236 --> 01:35:20,101
Spare them, Oh Lord.

545
01:36:44,322 --> 01:36:47,291


546
01:36:47,325 --> 01:36:49,623


547
01:36:49,661 --> 01:36:52,926

01:36:52,964 --> 01:36:54,955
