00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,185
Be careful.

181
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:05,428
There are still people
here who care for you.

182
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:48,235
You believe in God, Bohannon?

183
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,736
Jesus and all that shit?

184
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,472
I never understood people prayin' to a guy

185
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:55,442
who let himself get crucified.

186
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:58,277
And for what?

187
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:02,915
I reckon faith ain't
easily explained to some.

188
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:08,724
See, I stand here and I look,

189
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:11,127
and I see Cullen Bohannon,

190
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:15,634
but I sure as hell don't recognize him.

191
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:19,235
The jail, the load-up,
or the first water stop.

192
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:20,769
Which it gonna be?

193
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:23,006
I know you're planning something.

194
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,242
- Railroad work.
- Come on, now.

195
00:13:25,277 --> 00:13:28,911
Lying just outside the house of the Lord?

196
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:31,181
If you're so sure I'm lying,
why don't you arrest me?

197
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:34,850
Well, shit, I don't want
to ruin all the fun.

198
00:13:37,354 --> 00:13:41,860
Ain't too late to walk away.

199
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:45,427
Yeah, it is...

200
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:47,464
For both of us.

201
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:54,169
Hmm.

202
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:56,172
Best pray on it then.

203
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:58,342
Just to be safe.

204
00:13:58,376 --> 00:14:01,280
Oh, I leave the prayin' to you.

205
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:03,718
You gonna need it.

206
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:12,629
I got no feud with Campbell.

207
00:14:12,663 --> 00:14:14,733
He arrested your workers!

208
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:17,034
And your boss.

209
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:21,407
Durant dug his own grave,
as I knew he would sooner or later.

210
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:23,342
Road won't get built without him.

211
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:26,911
Going to war with the Governor
is insurrection, Mr. Bohannon.

212
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:28,476
Wouldn't be my first do-si-do.

213
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,210
You'll wind up in prison or worse.

214
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,511
Yeah, danced that number likewise.

215
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:35,513
What are you lookin' for?

216
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:39,116
Lookin' for the keys to the damn armory...

217
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:45,253
And a partner.

218
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:52,424
Mr. Bohannon, I'm an engineer,
not a gunslinger.

219
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:55,336
You work for the Union
Pacific, Mr. Delaney.

220
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,262
That's a dream for some.

221
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,667
For others, it's an obsession.

222
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:01,771
My granddaddy tore hisself a cotton empire

223
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:03,439
out of swamp bottom and a sun,

224
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:06,342
and I aim to do similar
with this here railroad.

225
00:15:06,376 --> 00:15:08,343
So you either give me them keys...

226
00:15:08,378 --> 00:15:10,311
Or you get out of my way.

227
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,794
All right then.

228
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:27,229
You got a plan...

229
00:15:27,263 --> 00:15:29,664
I hope.

230
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,187
That's great. Thank you.

231
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,546
You surprise me, miss Ellison.

232
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:49,413
A nice dinner and a glass of wine

233
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,888
don't change the truth, Mr. Campbell.

234
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,286
Nor would I expect them to.

235
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,788
I just didn't expect you to lend
any credence in your article

236
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,291
to my position over that of Mr. Bohannon's.

237
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,560
Mr. Bohannon sees the
world in black and white.

238
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,329
But we don't, do we?

239
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:08,332
I suspect what you and I have
in common, Mr. Campbell...

240
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:10,067
Among other things...

241
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:12,461
Is the certainty that the world
is neither black nor white

242
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,938
but decidedly gray.

243
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,943
That's what makes it both daunting and,

244
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:21,238
at times, alluring.

245
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,150
Not to mention surprising.

246
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:28,990
Perhaps it wouldn't be intolerable

247
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:31,826
to discuss a world,

248
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,529
in all its shade of gray,

249
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:38,867
over lunch at the Palmer?

250
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:42,905
That wouldn't be intolerable
at all, Mr. Campbell.

251
00:16:53,852 --> 00:16:55,688
Shotgun. Balls and powder.

252
00:16:58,762 --> 00:17:01,464
All of 'em.

253
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:02,532
The whole rack?

254
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,733
All of it.

255
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:10,674
I ain't trading on credit.

256
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,344
Neither am I. On the hop.

257
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:25,661
Ain't no secrets in this town, McGies.

258
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:28,966
You ought to know that by now.

259
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,108
Damn.

260
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:40,109
Lookee here, Bohannon.

261
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,348
Caught me another one.

262
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:09,050
[Grunting]

263
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:19,341
Now, I know them shotguns
wasn't just for shootin' fish.

264
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:21,211
I guess you just ain't had enough yet.

265
00:18:21,246 --> 00:18:22,514
[Laughs]

266
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:26,151
You got that right.

267
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:27,886
Stop it!

268
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,853
He obviously knows nothing or
he would have told you by now!

269
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:33,325
Yeah, you keep squawkin',
you'll be next, huckleberry.

270
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,863
Now, I know Bohannon is planning
on busting these men out...

271
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:42,535
And I know that you are a part of it.

272
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:45,274
So...

273
00:18:49,644 --> 00:18:51,280
Why won't he talk to me, Parker?

274
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:52,783
I don't know, Sid.

275
00:18:52,817 --> 00:18:55,716
- Maybe he don't like you.
- Doesn't like me?

276
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:57,754
[Groans]

277
00:18:57,788 --> 00:18:58,854
[Laughs]

278
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,289
[Coughs]

279
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:01,791
Go ahead, get him up.

280
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,764
Don't! No more!

281
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:11,901
No more.

282
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:13,437
That's enough.

283
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:26,074
He's gonna bust the men out.

284
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:28,910
Yeah, I know that.

285
00:19:28,944 --> 00:19:31,411
Where?

286
00:19:31,446 --> 00:19:33,943
The jail? The load-up?

287
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:37,382
The first water stop?

288
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:41,052
The load-up.

289
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:44,315
Get us out in the open. That's smart.

290
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,626
What else?

291
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:51,766
It's all I know.

292
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:53,937
I swear.

293
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:58,544
Lock him up.

294
00:20:04,516 --> 00:20:06,755
Prep the prisoners for load-up.

295
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,257
We ain't leavin' for two hours.

296
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,491
Adapt or die, atwood.

297
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:13,196
Adapt or die.

298
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:14,665
We still need to sweep the town.

299
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,803
We ain't got time...

300
00:20:16,837 --> 00:20:19,237
And neither does Bohannon.

301
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:56,773
[Knock at door]

302
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:17,977
You sang like a Irish canary.

303
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:23,450
I challenge any man here

304
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:27,223
to endure a beating like
that and keep his mouth shut.

305
00:23:27,257 --> 00:23:30,860
Bohannon was our last
chance to get out of here.

306
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:38,035
I go back to Alabama, I'm a dead man...

307
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:39,202
But you ain't gonna make it out this...

308
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:40,635
Whoa, hey! Easy!

309
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,169
Leave him be!

310
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,138
He gonna get what comin' to him!

311
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,507
Not from the likes of you, he won't!

312
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,010
Gentlemen, please!

313
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:49,379
Fighting amongst oursel...

314
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:51,146
Quiet, fat man!

315
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:55,182
It's 'cause of you we in here.

316
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:57,920
Got to say for yourself, Irish? Huh?

317
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:27,756
Speaks for itself, don't it?

318
00:25:16,773 --> 00:25:18,453
- [Gasps]
- Where is he?

319
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:19,977
You been hidin' him, ain't you?

320
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:21,312
He's not here.

321
00:25:21,347 --> 00:25:23,484
Yeah, but he was here, wasn't he?

322
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,520
Him and that lyin' shit-ass irishman.

323
00:25:25,554 --> 00:25:28,455
I've done nothing.

324
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:30,785
I have nothing for you.

325
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:41,334
Don't be playin' with fire, church lady.

326
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,374
All right, bring 'em out.

327
00:26:42,979 --> 00:26:44,179

328
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,618
Stay awake, gentlemen.

329
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:25,860
What are you thinking?

330
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:32,650
Considering your past...

331
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:34,817
Romantic predilections.

332
00:27:38,684 --> 00:27:40,920
You have been curious about me.

333
00:27:40,954 --> 00:27:43,321
Oh, I've made inquiries.

334
00:27:48,795 --> 00:27:53,565
When I was younger,
I used to think it made me abnormal.

335
00:27:55,903 --> 00:27:58,602
But after my time covering the war,

336
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:02,274
I realized that there were
men who were equally as...

337
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:04,676
Confused?

338
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:06,244
Curious.

339
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:19,022
What do you want, John Campbell?

340
00:28:19,056 --> 00:28:20,457
From you?

341
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,325
From life.

342
00:28:25,194 --> 00:28:28,330
One day...

343
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:31,806
When I get what I deserve...

344
00:28:31,841 --> 00:28:35,579
Without a fight...

345
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:39,315

00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:49,029

348
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:56,547
So far... no.

all the deputies they can spare.

water stop at kenmore.

00:29:21,587 --> 00:29:25,620
- Bohannon?
- Yeah.

00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:29,805
I never want to hear the
name Cullen Bohannon again.

358
00:29:58,906 --> 00:30:01,307

362
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,614
Hey!

363
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,516
Y'all get your minds right.

364
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,518
This ain't over till I say it is.

365
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,711
I don't like the way you're lookin' at me.

366
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:25,711
Lookin' at what?

367
00:33:25,746 --> 00:33:27,679
You hear what I said?

368
00:33:31,082 --> 00:33:33,015
[Grunts]

369
00:33:38,523 --> 00:33:40,221
You ignorant son of a bitch.

370
00:33:40,256 --> 00:33:42,690
That's gonna cost ya.

371
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:54,477
[Gasps and coughs]

372
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,899
No!

373
00:34:56,245 --> 00:34:58,311
Free the rest of them men.

374
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,351
- Watch over them guards.
- Thank you, Bohannon.

375
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:14,333
Aye, lads. Here's the business.

376
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:15,534
Unlock us.

377
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,106
- What's the matter?
- Shit!

378
00:35:51,141 --> 00:35:53,408
I told you this wasn't over.

379
00:35:56,741 --> 00:35:58,807
Stop the train! Now!

380
00:35:58,842 --> 00:36:01,410
We're goin' back.

381
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:12,424
All right, Bohannon.

382
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:19,363
If we return to Cheyenne
with them on our tail,

383
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:21,096
we'll be right back where we started.

384
00:36:21,122 --> 00:36:22,422
Free, ain't ya?

385
00:36:22,457 --> 00:36:25,159
For the moment.

386
00:36:25,193 --> 00:36:27,727
Them men might fight for Campbell's cause,

387
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:29,228
but they sure as hell won't die for Sidney.

388
00:36:29,262 --> 00:36:30,561
What makes you so sure?

389
00:36:30,596 --> 00:36:32,095
For one thing, they're outmanned.

390
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,265
- And we're outgunned.
- Not anymore.

391
00:36:45,344 --> 00:36:47,347
He's not going to give up without a fight.

392
00:36:47,381 --> 00:36:49,851
Yeah, I won't kill Sidney...

393
00:36:49,886 --> 00:36:52,154
But I will bring him in.

394
00:36:52,188 --> 00:36:53,509
Now, when we get back to Cheyenne,

395
00:36:53,522 --> 00:36:55,456
you make things right with Campbell.

396
00:36:55,491 --> 00:36:57,524
He wants to keep his job.

397
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:59,427
He'll negotiate with you.

398
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:03,433
Your confidence is very
annoying, Bohannon.

399
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:07,937
I was just ponderin'
what you'd do if things was similar.

400
00:37:07,972 --> 00:37:10,571
I'm wrong, you tell me now.

401
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:18,542
Just like old times.

402
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:21,611
I preferred the cover of the hotel...

403
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:23,815
When they were shooting at you.

404
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:30,487
[Train brakes squeal]

405
00:37:34,995 --> 00:37:37,364
Sidney!

406
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,533
That weren't real gentleman-like, Bohannon...

407
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:50,337
Stealin' all my prisoners like that.

408
00:37:50,372 --> 00:37:53,841
Never should have given me them keys, son.

409
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:57,644
Ah.

410
00:37:57,678 --> 00:38:00,043
I'ma need those prisoners back.

411
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,980
Them prisoners is liberated, and armed.

412
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,580
- Can't win this one.
- Oh, yeah?

413
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:08,148
I ain't gonna parlay with you, Bohannon.

414
00:38:08,182 --> 00:38:11,029
I reckon we gonna have to shoot it out.

415
00:38:15,624 --> 00:38:18,560
Yeah, you could always give yourself up.

416
00:38:18,595 --> 00:38:21,763
[Laughs]

417
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:25,401
Ah. Why don't you come on over
here and give yourself up?

418
00:38:29,202 --> 00:38:32,102
That's what I thought.

419
00:38:32,136 --> 00:38:34,779
Just gonna have to come get me, I guess.

420
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:35,904
Mm-hmm.

421
00:38:44,215 --> 00:38:45,914
Delaney!

422
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:57,361
[Whistles]

423
00:38:57,395 --> 00:39:01,933
Last chance, Sid. End of the line.

424
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:28,626
[Gunshots]

425
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:43,473
Whoo!

426
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,847
Keep 'em pinned, boys!

427
00:40:13,882 --> 00:40:15,282
Delaney! Damn it, Delaney!

428
00:40:15,316 --> 00:40:17,718
Do it now!

429
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,386
Hold your fire!

430
00:40:58,025 --> 00:40:59,392
Hold! Enough!

431
00:40:59,426 --> 00:41:03,496
Enough! Hold it!

432
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,598
Damn it, Delaney! Hold your damn fire!

433
00:41:16,075 --> 00:41:19,614
Sidney!

434
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:21,881
Sidney Snow!

435
00:41:42,473 --> 00:41:44,241
Where'd he go?

436
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:09,408
Where is that bastard?

437
00:42:09,442 --> 00:42:12,777
Gone.

438
00:42:12,811 --> 00:42:15,780
No, he ain't.
