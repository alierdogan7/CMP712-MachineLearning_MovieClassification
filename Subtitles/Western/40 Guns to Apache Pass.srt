1
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,652
For years following the Civil War

2
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:26,611
the question was whether Indians
or the United States Army

3
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:29,402
would control Arizona Territory.

4
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:32,511
Bands of hostile Apaches
roamed the countryside.

5
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:35,697
Only the courage and dedication
of a few brave fighting men

6
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:38,292
kept the Territory from being
completely overrun.

7
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:50,704
In the summer of 1869,

8
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:53,700
Cochise, bold chief of
the Chiricahua Apaches,

9
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:58,240
made a brutal vow to kill every man,
woman and child in southern Arizona.

10
00:01:59,112 --> 00:02:00,683
Many of the settlers in the area

11
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,949
had already felt the fury
of Cochise's bloody oath.

12
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:06,481
A small detail of
United States cav alrymen

13
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:10,180
were escorting the survivors to
a hastily-established outpost.

14
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:13,845
There, the Army was determined
to make a last-ditch stand.

15
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,378
I know how to spell our name.

16
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:41,181
Go work.

17
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:42,717
Hey! Hey, look!

18
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,452
It's Bruce.

19
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:56,467
Don't get your hopes up, sis,
when the Captain comes courting

20
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:58,365
he doesn't bring a crowd of people.

21
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:06,281
Ellen.
- It's good to see you, Bruce.

22
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:07,686
Is something wrong?

23
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,188
Your pa at the house?
- Yeah.

24
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:10,615
Let's go talk to him.

25
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,912
Isn't that the Carter family?

26
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:15,199
What's left of them.
Apaches hit this morning.

27
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:16,472
Your place will be next.

28
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:18,828
Sure glad you came to stand
them off, Captain.

29
00:03:18,863 --> 00:03:21,177
We make our stand at Apache Wells.

30
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:25,273
Oh, you're going to have a hard time
talking Pa into leaving.

31
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:28,253
They all wanted to stay, too.

32
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:30,973
The Apaches made a pretty good
argument against it.

33
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:41,603
Sergeant Walker.

34
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,923
Have some of the men
find their wagon.

35
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,167
Pitch it up and bring it
to the house.

36
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:49,786
Captain, wait. Don't you think you
ought to talk to Pa first?

37
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:51,407
I think he'll understand.

38
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:00,713
Pa!

39
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:11,586
Captain Coburn.

40
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:12,991
Mrs Malone.

41
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:15,368
Cochise's gone on the war path.
- What?

42
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:18,327
We're escorting the settlers
into Apache Wells.

43
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:22,933
I didn't ask for any escorting.

44
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:25,892
Neither did they, Cochise sent his
braves to burn them out.

45
00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:27,815
Pa knows how to deal
with the Apaches.

46
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,024
There's no dealing with them, Mike.
How many guns do you have?

47
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,088
Just this one.

48
00:04:34,202 --> 00:04:36,022
She's never failed me yet.

49
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:40,770
Look, Mr Malone.
Our job is to protect you people.

50
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:42,927
We can't put soldiers
at every farm house.

51
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:46,159
You've got to come in where our
strength is concentrated.

52
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:48,053
You better listen to him, Harry.

53
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,041
Kate.

54
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:54,958
We have given ten long years of
hard work to build up this place.

55
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:58,183
And you'll give your life
if you try to hang onto it.

56
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:02,222
Cochise made a vow he'd kill every
white man in southern Arizona.

57
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:04,258
Looks like he's already started.

58
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,124
Now this is no time to argue.

59
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:10,719
I'm not going to let you stay here
and get killed.

60
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:26,091
Well, I guess it's the only way.

61
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,162
It'll take me a little
while to pack.

62
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:29,812
Sorry, ma'am, we can't wait.

63
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:31,872
Troopers will bring
your wagon around.

64
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:33,566
Be ready to go when it gets here.

65
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:40,777
Come on, Ma.

66
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,955
Pick up what you can, kids.

67
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:57,405
Captain, shall I order
the men to dismount?

68
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,814
Sergeant Walker gives the orders.

69
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:04,565
I know that, sir, but the men
asked me to talk to you.

70
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,650
They're complaining you're driving
them too hard. They need a rest.

71
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:11,202
They can rest when we
get back to camp.

72
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,990
I know, Captain, but we got to
stop somewhere.

73
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,622
There's water, hay for the horses.

74
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:18,512
We can stand off the Apaches here
as good as any other place.

75
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:21,249
Bodine, are you talking command
of this outfit?

76
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:23,542
No, sir.

77
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:28,164
When I was a sergeant the officers
used to listen to what I had to say.

78
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,915
Is that why they broke
you to Corporal?

79
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,509
They'll need me again, sir.

80
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:36,560
Maybe they will, but by God I don't.

81
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:39,096
If you give me one more
bit of trouble

82
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,597
I'll bust you all the way
back to Privey.

83
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:43,485
Now, mount up.

84
00:06:44,552 --> 00:06:45,428
Yes, sir.

85
00:06:58,153 --> 00:07:00,724
Locking horns with
the Captain again, Bodine?

86
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:05,958
I don't back off for nobody,
Sergeant.

87
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:07,729
Well, that's why you're here.

88
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:11,775
You and a dozen more like it
that nobody else could handle.

89
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,995
Sergeant, I want to tell you
something.

90
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,193
He might break the rest of them
but he won't even make a dent in me.

91
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:29,313
Sergeant Walker?
- Hello.

92
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,988
Put a match to it, no use leaving
anything for Cochise.

93
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,788
Whoa!

94
00:08:08,347 --> 00:08:11,575
Captain Coburn drove
the settlers hard all day,

95
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,803
but nightfall and weariness
finally forced a halt.

96
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:17,650
I want your complete
cooperation tonight.

97
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:21,200
If we're attacked they'll probably
hit the wagons and the horses first.

98
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:24,272
I want you people to bed down
right up there in those rocks.

99
00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:26,487
There'll be no fires, no noise.

100
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:28,627
Be ready to move out at daylight.

101
00:08:28,662 --> 00:08:31,419
We don't have much water, sir.
- I know.

102
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:34,844
Give the women and children what they
need, save the rest for the horses.

103
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,094
Get them started, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:41,529
All right. Bring your belongings
and come with me.

105
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:55,191
Look, Captain,
what about us troopers?

106
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:57,079
We're just as thirsty as they are.

107
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:59,064
We've been riding in
the hot sun all day.

108
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:01,363
It won't hurt you to go one night
without water.

109
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:03,689
Look, Capt...
- That's all, Bodine.

110
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:16,373
You know, we'd better get ready to
help if there's Indian trouble.

111
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,496
Let's ask the Captain if he'll
lend us a couple of rifles.

112
00:09:20,531 --> 00:09:23,989
You know how I am with guns, Mike.
Can't hit the broad side of a barn!

113
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:26,973
Well, if those Apaches get close,
you'll learn fast enough.

114
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:44,635
Any chance those Apaches will
hit tonight, Captain?

115
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,829
They don't let me in on their
plans always, Mike.

116
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:49,482
Just try to keep ready.

117
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:52,930
Doug and I would like to help if
you'd let us have a couple rifles.

118
00:09:56,234 --> 00:10:00,432
I appreciate the offer but I don't
have enough guns to arm my own men.

119
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:05,235
Well, then I guess we'll have to
sharpen up the old axe, huh?

120
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,452
Many a battle has been won with less.

121
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:11,184
Hey, Mike, Doug?
Come on, give me help.

122
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:20,994
Here. Ma and Pa went up the hill,
you can take them up, huh?

123
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,316
All right.

124
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:31,163
Oh!

125
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:37,912
It's been a long time since we've
been able to talk to each other.

126
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:41,221
Over a month, Colonel hasn't been
too generous with leave time lately.

127
00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:44,301
Oh, well you won't have
any more excuses.

128
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:45,947
I'll be right there at Apache Wells.

129
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:48,447
I won't be looking for excuses.

130
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:52,147
Come on, I'll walk you.

131
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:55,265
Mm, uh-uh. I like it right here.

132
00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:01,589
Listen to that lonely sound.

133
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:06,281
Probably a lonely Apache scout.

134
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,752
Did you come out here just to
protect me from the Indians?

135
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:14,661
Well, not exactly but...

136
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:17,768
They'd give anything for a scalp
as pretty as that one.

137
00:11:18,942 --> 00:11:21,502
How about you? Hmm?

138
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:35,157
It'd be awful easy to hand it to you.

139
00:11:36,302 --> 00:11:37,678
Why don't you?

140
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:43,476
I'm not a very good bet for
a girl like you.

141
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:47,846
Men in my business don't
stick around too long.

142
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,108
Your warning comes
a bit late, Bruce.

143
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,750
I'm going up the hill, see you later.

144
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,362
You know that's all
the water we have.

145
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:44,283
You'd never do that if you weren't
hiding behind those Captain's bars.

146
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:46,346
I'm not hiding behind anything,
Bodine.

147
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:50,112
I fought in this army for ten years
before they pinned these on me.

148
00:12:50,147 --> 00:12:51,902
I don't need them now.

149
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:53,687
Oh?

150
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:58,718
You mean you're willing to forget
you're an officer

151
00:12:58,753 --> 00:13:00,390
and reckon man to man?

152
00:13:01,993 --> 00:13:03,858
I've tried everything else with you.

153
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:06,589
I guess that's the only language
you understand.

154
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,501
Captain! Captain!

155
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:45,034
Captain, you'll kill him, sir.

156
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,955
Pick those horses up and put
a guard on the water.

157
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,985
Yes, sir.

158
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:32,809
Apache Wells, Arizona territory.

159
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:35,809
Colonel Homer Reed in command
of a troop of cavalry

160
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:39,723
whose assignment was to hold
the lonely outpost at any cost

161
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:42,975
and to protect the settlers
in the adjacent area.

162
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,184
Nearby families had already
taken refuge here,

163
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:49,393
only the most distant ranches
remained to be accounted for.

164
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:52,110
Attention! At ease.

165
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:58,647
That Captain Coburn's outfit?
- No sir, that's the morning patrol.

166
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:01,168
Captain was due back yesterday,
wasn't he, sir?

167
00:16:01,203 --> 00:16:03,922
I'll send a detail if they don't
return by nightfall.

168
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,755
The old man is lost if Coburn
isn't around.

169
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,873
It'd suit me if that stiff-necked
Captain never came back.

170
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,705
Bugler! Sound assembly.

171
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:14,779
Take care of your wounded.

172
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:17,647
The rest of you, hold your posts.
They might come back.

173
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:23,936
Good work, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

174
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:26,405
Captain and me have ridden together
for a long time.

175
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,364
Can't lose him this close to home.

176
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:31,264
These Apaches are getting bolder.

177
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:33,347
I thought they'd follow you
into camp.

178
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:35,134
Maybe next time they will.

179
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,470
I'm getting sick and tired of
having to turn and run

180
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:40,610
every time an Apache
sticks his head up.

181
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:43,645
When are we getting those
new rifles, Colonel?

182
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,607
I've put in requests at least
a dozen times.

183
00:17:46,642 --> 00:17:49,713
Army keeps sending back excuses
instead of rifles.

184
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:53,270
They give us an impossible job
and no tools to do it with.

185
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,900
How long do you think we could hold
this place against an all-out attack?

186
00:17:56,935 --> 00:18:00,273
Not long with our old worn-out guns.

187
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:04,593
You think Cochise would risk all his
forces on a frontal assault?

188
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:06,429
He's smart, Colonel.

189
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:09,365
When our patrols can't stand
and fight it shows weakness.

190
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,991
He won't be long in
taking adv antage of it.

191
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:16,235
At least you got the settlers here
where our power is concentrated.

192
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,551
Show them where to set up camp,
will you?

193
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:19,749
Yes, sir.

194
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,471
Bodine.

195
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:37,918
Why didn't you pick him up?

196
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:41,081
I don't know what you're
talking about.

197
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:42,929
Stand up when I'm talking to you!

198
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:52,901
You heard me call.

199
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:54,756
With all that shooting?

200
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,364
I didn't hear nothing.

201
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:00,983
That beating the Captain gave you
didn't teach you much, did it?

202
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:07,341
Oh, I haven't forgotten anything
about that, Sergeant.

203
00:19:20,889 --> 00:19:24,177
He did a pretty good job on ya.
- Yeah.

204
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,326
You...

205
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,830
Anybody else want to
take a look, huh?

206
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:37,743
Anybody else want to take a look?
Look! Come on, look!

207
00:19:40,356 --> 00:19:43,883
Anybody else down here?
Come on, look at it!

208
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:51,857
Don't think that this gives
Captain Coburn the whip hand.

209
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:55,485
Oh I'm going to be a good soldier
from now on.

210
00:19:57,121 --> 00:20:00,818
Every time the Captain rides out of
this camp I'll be right behind him.

211
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:04,120
He catches a bullet I want to
make sure he's dead.

212
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:31,097
Malone's old rifle had
finally failed him.

213
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,551
Ironically, an Apache bullet
had caught him

214
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:35,476
just as safety seemed assured.

215
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:41,218
He's dead!

216
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:43,608
I thought we'd made it but...

217
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,430
He was laying dead on that seat
when we got in.

218
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:52,875
If we joined the Army...

219
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:55,838
...could we get some rifles, Captain?

220
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:59,988
I'd see that you get guns some way.

221
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:04,246
Good 'cause we're ready to fight!

222
00:21:32,511 --> 00:21:35,776
Stand at... ease.

223
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:56,842
Colonel Reed had fired off an angry
demand to his home base.

224
00:21:56,877 --> 00:22:00,840
After two weeks of anxious waiting,
a reply finally came.

225
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,200
All right, what is it?

226
00:22:02,235 --> 00:22:05,329
A shipment of new lever-action
rifles came in from back east.

227
00:22:05,364 --> 00:22:08,020
They're sending you 40 of them.
- When do we get them?

228
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:10,677
You'll have to meet them beyond
the Chiricahua mountains.

229
00:22:10,712 --> 00:22:13,011
They hired some scouts to
bring them that far.

230
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:15,822
Figured you fellas were the best
to sneak them past Cochise.

231
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:18,063
They sure give us
the tough end of it.

232
00:22:18,098 --> 00:22:19,679
It's up to you, Bruce.

233
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,842
We'll get them through.
- Going to have your hands full.

234
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:25,009
Those mountains are crawling
with Apache.

235
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:27,797
Three different bunches of them
gave me a run.

236
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,952
I had to come around here through
the Apache pass to get by them.

237
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:34,855
May as well back the same way.

238
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,267
Keep your eyes open.

239
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:39,271
The guns will be here at
Hatchet Rock tomorrow, noon.

240
00:22:39,306 --> 00:22:40,888
Hatchet Rock.

241
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:43,653
Might as well keep it, Captain.
Might come in handy.

242
00:22:43,688 --> 00:22:44,653
Thank you.

243
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:47,555
You've done a good job,
the rest is up to us now.

244
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,570
Better get some rest.
- Thank you, sir.

245
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:01,209
Well, Bruce the Army finally
came through, 40 repeating rifles.

246
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:04,555
That will improve our
chances against Cochise.

247
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,117
Improve them? Trade our old
singleshots for those lever actions,

248
00:23:08,152 --> 00:23:10,804
we can hold off all the Apache
in this territory.

249
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,548
We're going to have to
bring them in first.

250
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,474
I'll get some men together now, sir.

251
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:18,876
Take as many men as you need,
I don't want to be left shorthanded

252
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:21,281
but take enough troopers
to get the job done.

253
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:25,666
We'll sneak out of here after dark,
Apache won't even know we're gone.

254
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:30,012
Oh, Captain.
- Yes, sir?

255
00:23:30,047 --> 00:23:32,436
That last mission you were on...

256
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:36,601
...there is a rumour that you
beat up one of the men.

257
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:42,969
Colonel, you know how rumours get
started on a small post like this.

258
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:45,891
This is a serious matter, Captain.

259
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:48,827
I'll overlook it this time,
but from now on try...

260
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,852
Baby them a little more?

261
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:54,643
Captain, there are two ways
to get men through a door,

262
00:23:54,678 --> 00:23:58,100
you can kick them through or
you can lead them through.

263
00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:01,523
That's right, sir, but they wind up
the same place anyway.

264
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:05,824
Take a look out there, Colonel.

265
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:09,593
It's not exactly the cream
of the crop,

266
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:12,824
yet we're expected to make soldiers
out of all of them.

267
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:16,020
I know it's a ragtag bunch they
sent us to fight Indians,

268
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,454
but this mission is vital, Bruce.

269
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:21,128
We can't afford any trouble
in the ranks.

270
00:24:22,218 --> 00:24:24,061
I don't expect any trouble, sir.

271
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,078
Sir...

272
00:24:31,294 --> 00:24:34,900
With the Captain's permission,
I'd like to go along on this one.

273
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:39,203
You sure got a sixth sense for
something big, haven't you, Sergeant?

274
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:42,838
Well sir, I been around long enough
to get these stripes here,

275
00:24:42,873 --> 00:24:45,190
I'm bound to know if
something's going on.

276
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:46,208
I see.

277
00:24:46,243 --> 00:24:47,904
It's the rifles, isn't it, sir?

278
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:51,717
Yes, it is. Let's just keep it
between the two of us.

279
00:24:51,752 --> 00:24:54,516
The less the men know, the less
the Apache can get out of them

280
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:56,222
in case they get captured.

281
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:01,477
Attention.

282
00:25:05,352 --> 00:25:10,107
I need ten men for a mission,
a very important one...

283
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:13,271
...and it's very dangerous.

284
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:15,472
I'm asking for volunteers.

285
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,664
Come on, Doug!

286
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:54,736
What's the matter with you, Fuller?

287
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,547
What about you, Higgins?

288
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:07,671
Thank you, men. We'll leave tonight.

289
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,461
Check your equipment,
take care of your horses.

290
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:13,772
Dismissed.

291
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:26,246
Captain?
- What is it, Sergeant?

292
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:30,610
You said this was an important
mission but...

293
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,013
It is.

294
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:36,954
You sure haven't got the best men
riding with us.

295
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,723
Those two green Malone boys,
it's their first time out.

296
00:26:41,758 --> 00:26:44,169
Bodine, he's always trouble.

297
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:47,219
He'll do, Sergeant.

298
00:26:47,254 --> 00:26:49,973
Have them ready after chow.
- Yes, sir.

299
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:15,911
They're proud to be riding
with you, Bruce.

300
00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:18,956
Glad to have them.
They'll make good soldiers.

301
00:27:19,883 --> 00:27:22,568
Watch out for both of them,
especially Doug.

302
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:27,269
Mike can take care of himself
but Doug...

303
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:29,989
...he'll need help at first.

304
00:27:31,004 --> 00:27:32,528
I'll keep an eye on him.

305
00:27:33,642 --> 00:27:38,750
I guess it's because I'm older that
they seem like such boys to me.

306
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:45,432
They'll be men when we come back.

307
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,547
They're waiting for us, Doug
we've got to go.

308
00:27:56,582 --> 00:27:57,792
Goodbye, Mama.

309
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,077
Boy, take care of Doug, huh?

310
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:07,835
Goodbye, sis.
- Bye.

311
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,145
Goodbye, sis.
- Take care.

312
00:28:14,142 --> 00:28:16,144
Everybody is counting on you, Bruce.

313
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,146
You've got to get those
rifles through.

314
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:19,880
We'll do our best, sir.

315
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,493
Under the cover of darkness,

316
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:52,157
Captain Coburn moved out with his
little band of volunteers.

317
00:28:52,192 --> 00:28:54,001
Everything depended on his success

318
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:57,722
in reaching the rendezvous with
the supply wagon and the 40 rifles.

319
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:13,638
Coburn led his men deep into
the Chiricahua mountains.

320
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:16,063
When they reached Apache Pass

321
00:29:16,098 --> 00:29:20,034
the Captain sensed that hostile eyes
were watching from the high rocks.

322
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:22,112
Have a look now, sir.

323
00:29:23,092 --> 00:29:25,596
Apache can hide in a badger hole.

324
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:28,168
Hold up a couple of minutes,
I want to take a look.

325
00:29:28,203 --> 00:29:29,328
Yes, sir.

326
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:36,724
Apaches wouldn't take on this many
soldiers would they, Mike?

327
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,517
You're not scared, are you?

328
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:41,805
A little, aren't you?

329
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,371
Of course not.

330
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,132
That's what we joined up for,
to get a crack at them.

331
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:50,160
I think I can shoot once but
I wonder if I'll be able to reload

332
00:29:50,195 --> 00:29:52,614
with a bunch of Indians
hollering down on me.

333
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:56,335
You'll do fine.

334
00:29:57,285 --> 00:29:59,833
Just remember we'll be fighting them
side by side.

335
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:03,355
Hooo!

336
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:29,478
All right, two men dismount
and take cover.

337
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:39,725
He signalled to someone up there
before I got him.

338
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,425
That means they know we're coming.

339
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:50,313
You look a little pale, boys.

340
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,282
I thought you wanted to
see 'em butchered.

341
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,478
Leave those two kids with the horses.

342
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:57,073
Assign a rearguard and the rest
of you come with me.

343
00:30:57,108 --> 00:30:58,031
Yes, sir.

344
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:04,042
Malone brothers,
stay with the horses.

345
00:31:04,077 --> 00:31:05,366
Yes, sir.

346
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:07,530
Bodine.
- Yes, Sergeant?

347
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,534
You, you post the rearguard
and cover.

348
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,274
The rest of you come with me.

349
00:31:58,512 --> 00:31:59,752
Doug!

350
00:32:03,624 --> 00:32:04,993
Look, I saw one.
- What?

351
00:32:05,028 --> 00:32:07,844
I saw one up there!
Let's go get him.

352
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:10,146
But, the Sergeant told us
to stay here.

353
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:12,368
But, he didn't tell us not to fight.

354
00:32:12,403 --> 00:32:15,691
I'll circle around this way,
you come up the back of him.

355
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,109
Mike?

356
00:32:18,034 --> 00:32:21,242
Come on now, you've got to get
your feet wet sometime.

357
00:32:21,277 --> 00:32:23,686
This is as good a place as any.

358
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,834
I'm scared, Mike. I'm scared.

359
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:31,982
I never should have joined the Army.

360
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:37,479
Look, I know how you feel,
everybody's nervous at first.

361
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,918
You'll get over it once you
get into the action.

362
00:32:40,953 --> 00:32:44,992
Well, come on!
Let's go get us an Apache.

363
00:32:45,027 --> 00:32:47,419
Mike. Mike!

364
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,785
Doug! Come on, Doug.

365
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,377
I'm coming, Mike.

366
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:51,830
Doug, help me! Doug!

367
00:34:03,797 --> 00:34:05,310
Doug, come on help me.

368
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,441
Mike!

369
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:35,259
Mike!

370
00:34:55,499 --> 00:34:57,114
Where's Mike?

371
00:34:58,324 --> 00:35:02,385
I tell you where he is,
the Apaches carried him away.

372
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:05,877
This kid didn't have the guts
to help his brother.

373
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:10,132
I can't believe that, Doug.

374
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:11,553
It's true.

375
00:35:15,063 --> 00:35:17,042
He just kept calling me.

376
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:21,194
I couldn't make myself go to him.

377
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:22,937
I can still hear him.

378
00:35:24,063 --> 00:35:26,543
I can still hear him
calling for help.

379
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:32,361
Fetch the horses.

380
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:36,169
On your feet.

381
00:35:43,826 --> 00:35:44,702
Mike!

382
00:35:45,712 --> 00:35:46,667
Mike!

383
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,798
Mike, Mike!

384
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:53,462
Please, please let me go!
I've got to help him.

385
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:55,447
Mike, please!
- Take it easy, kid.

386
00:35:55,482 --> 00:35:57,679
Let me go. Let me go!

387
00:35:57,714 --> 00:35:59,839
Shut up!
- Mike, Mike!

388
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:02,217
Mike! Mike!
- Doug. Listen, Doug.

389
00:36:04,338 --> 00:36:06,051
Now you listen to me.

390
00:36:06,086 --> 00:36:09,214
Its too late to help your brother.
He's dead, you understand?

391
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:10,581
He's dead.

392
00:36:10,616 --> 00:36:12,595
Get him on a horse.

393
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,446
The troopers were on the run.

394
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:51,744
The Captain couldn't afford
to lose one more man.

395
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:55,590
If those 40 repeating rifles didn't
get back to Apache Wells,

396
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:58,789
Cochise would massacre every one
of its defenders.

397
00:37:10,374 --> 00:37:12,558
As far as we go, Sergeant.

398
00:37:12,593 --> 00:37:14,788
We going to be here long, Captain?

399
00:37:14,823 --> 00:37:16,792
I don't think so, why?

400
00:37:18,114 --> 00:37:20,014
I've a feeling we're being watched.

401
00:37:20,049 --> 00:37:21,765
You could be right.

402
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,754
Dismount.

403
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:24,677
Keep your rifles handy.

404
00:37:43,948 --> 00:37:46,781
We going to go back the same way
we came, sir?

405
00:37:47,695 --> 00:37:51,005
I don't think it makes any difference
how we go back, Sergeant.

406
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,993
If we get hit again we'll just
have to make a run for it.

407
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:57,825
We left half our men
lying dead back there.

408
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,022
Yes, sir.

409
00:37:59,858 --> 00:38:01,792
Some of the best ones, too.

410
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:07,775
There's only seven of us left
to get them guns through.

411
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,079
Six.

412
00:38:09,114 --> 00:38:11,730
Six men and a worthless, yellow kid.

413
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:14,957
Don't be too hard on him, Captain.

414
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,218
Remember that was his first time
under fire.

415
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:21,007
That's no excuse. I've got no use
for a coward, Sergeant.

416
00:38:22,644 --> 00:38:23,850
Yes, sir.

417
00:38:46,294 --> 00:38:47,737
Bodine.
- Hmm?

418
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:51,117
When we going to get out of here?
- Shh! When I say so.

419
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:54,285
Come on, we got a couple of
pretty good horses.

420
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,800
What are we waiting for?

421
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:58,487
I've still got something
to settle with that Captain.

422
00:38:58,522 --> 00:39:01,696
Get it settled, I don't intend to
ride back to that death trap.

423
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,912
I promise you one thing, we'll never
go back with this outfit.

424
00:39:24,352 --> 00:39:25,853
Hold your fire.

425
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,048
Glad you're here, Captain.
I didn't aim to wait long.

426
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:50,901
Kind of jumpy, aren't you?
- There's good reason.

427
00:39:50,936 --> 00:39:54,736
We come within a ace of tangling with
a herd of Apache about an hour ago.

428
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:56,135
Chiricahuas?

429
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,968
No, them's Tontos.
Them's wearing war paint.

430
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:00,873
Seem to knows where they's going.

431
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:02,460
To join Cochise.

432
00:40:02,495 --> 00:40:03,975
That's my guess.

433
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,626
We're shorthanded,
be glad to have you ride with us.

434
00:40:06,661 --> 00:40:08,055
Not on your life.

435
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,571
My contract called for me to bring
this wagon here and no further.

436
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:17,044
I value my head too much to travel
into Chiricahua country

437
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:20,224
with old Cochise on the war path
like he is.

438
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:21,810
You got a point there.

439
00:40:21,845 --> 00:40:24,040
Army doesn't give us any such choice.

440
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:25,807
That's your problem, Captain.

441
00:40:26,744 --> 00:40:28,450
Mind if we take off now?

442
00:40:34,472 --> 00:40:36,736
All right gather around, men.

443
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,078
This is what we came for.

444
00:40:52,123 --> 00:40:53,502
40 repeating rifles.

445
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:56,210
No other gun of its kind
in southern Arizona.

446
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,304
Oh-wee!

447
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:05,285
With these the Indians could wipe out
every white man in this territory.

448
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,662
I've got to get them through to
Apache Wells and we will,

449
00:41:09,697 --> 00:41:12,951
else there will be seven more dead
troopers lying in these hills.

450
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:18,631
Now, if we are overrun...

451
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:22,687
...the last man alive will
light this fuse...

452
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:26,723
...and stay with this wagon until
it's blown to hell.

453
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:33,381
Are there any questions?

454
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:38,678
Good.

455
00:41:45,748 --> 00:41:48,285
Sergeant, want me to take the team?

456
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,389
Sure. Go ahead, Bodine.

457
00:41:57,606 --> 00:42:01,415
Hey! I thought you said we weren't
going to go back with this outfit.

458
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:05,225
You just relax, Barrett, just relax.
There's been a change of plans.

459
00:42:55,402 --> 00:42:57,236
I didn't tell you to stop, Bodine.

460
00:42:57,271 --> 00:43:00,559
Captain, it's a long pull up
that hill, the horses are winded.

461
00:43:03,078 --> 00:43:06,036
All right, dismount.
We'll rest here for a minute.

462
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,523
Good shot, Barrett.

463
00:43:20,558 --> 00:43:22,107
Come on, tie him up.

464
00:43:23,126 --> 00:43:25,629
The rest of you keep those rifles
pointing in the air.

465
00:43:38,486 --> 00:43:41,960
Now, me and Barrett are taking off
with these rifles.

466
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:45,434
Don't worry, we're not hogs,
these guns are worth plenty.

467
00:43:45,469 --> 00:43:47,271
We might need some help.

468
00:43:54,316 --> 00:43:56,238
The Captain didn't
offer you anything

469
00:43:56,273 --> 00:43:57,967
when he asked you to volunteer.

470
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,739
Go along with me,
I'll make you rich.

471
00:43:59,774 --> 00:44:03,460
You do that and you'll sign the death
warrant of everybody at Apache Wells.

472
00:44:03,495 --> 00:44:07,200
Don't worry about that, these guns
will make us king of the mountain.

473
00:44:07,235 --> 00:44:10,132
Higgins, what about you?
I know you like money.

474
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:14,730
Come on, you'll never have a chance
like this with that uniform.

475
00:44:22,392 --> 00:44:25,008
Eight dollars a month
don't pile up very fast.

476
00:44:25,802 --> 00:44:27,857
I knew you'd see it my way.

477
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:30,403
Well, Fuller?

478
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:31,860
Oh, that's right.

479
00:44:31,895 --> 00:44:35,635
You'd rather have the Captain
chew your tail out every day,

480
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,924
or are you waiting for the Apaches
to come along and finish the job?

481
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:41,501
You'll be running the rest
of your life, Fuller.

482
00:44:41,536 --> 00:44:44,043
You'll have to hide your face
everywhere you go.

483
00:44:45,124 --> 00:44:47,372
How long do you think he's been
called Fuller?

484
00:44:47,407 --> 00:44:50,604
That's right, I changed my name
to get into the Army.

485
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:52,446
I sure don't mind changing it
to get out.

486
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,518
Right, and when we get to where
we're going, which is Mexico,

487
00:44:55,553 --> 00:44:58,324
soon as we cross that border
you can call yourself lucky

488
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:01,313
when those senoritas start
swarming all over you.

489
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:15,862
Kid, how about making it unanimous?

490
00:45:18,731 --> 00:45:20,562
Oh, come on now!

491
00:45:21,795 --> 00:45:23,966
You sure you don't want to
face your folks

492
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:26,138
right after letting your
brother get killed?

493
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:37,240
What about them?

494
00:45:37,275 --> 00:45:39,220
We can't just leave them
here to die.

495
00:45:39,255 --> 00:45:41,322
Ah, don't worry about it.

496
00:45:41,357 --> 00:45:43,483
We'll let them loose
before we leave.

497
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:45,610
They'll make their way back
all right.

498
00:45:46,942 --> 00:45:50,093
Come on, kid!
You coming with us or not?

499
00:45:55,565 --> 00:45:56,645
All right.

500
00:45:57,539 --> 00:45:59,734
As long as you're letting them go.

501
00:46:05,293 --> 00:46:08,478
Pack those rifles on the team,
we're heading across country.

502
00:46:19,113 --> 00:46:21,547
I'd offer to take you with us,
Sergeant,

503
00:46:21,582 --> 00:46:23,461
but you might slow us down.

504
00:46:26,854 --> 00:46:29,470
Damn you, Bodine.

505
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:40,753
Well, Captain...

506
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:46,161
You've been top dog for a long time.

507
00:46:46,196 --> 00:46:49,370
You know there's an old saying,
"Every dog has his day".

508
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:53,338
And I'm doing the barking now.

509
00:46:53,373 --> 00:46:56,820
I thought that uniform would do
something for any man that wore it,

510
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,381
even you, Bodine.

511
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:00,555
Well, it did something for me.

512
00:47:01,432 --> 00:47:03,150
It got me what I've been
waiting for.

513
00:47:03,185 --> 00:47:04,906
Chance to turn traitor?

514
00:47:04,941 --> 00:47:08,365
Well, I guess it's all in the way
you look at it.

515
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,359
See, the uniform I
started out in was grey.

516
00:47:12,793 --> 00:47:15,739
When I was captured at Shiloh
they gave me a choice...

517
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:20,222
...to rot in a stinking
Yankee prison camp...

518
00:47:21,283 --> 00:47:24,215
...or join you Blue Coats
fighting Indians.

519
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,597
You see, Captain Sir,
I'm sort of a galvanised Yankee.

520
00:47:27,632 --> 00:47:30,944
I don't have too much respect
for this blue outfit.

521
00:47:31,973 --> 00:47:35,727
I don't imagine you had too much
loyalty for the grey one, either.

522
00:47:35,762 --> 00:47:37,970
I want to tell you something,
Captain.

523
00:47:38,005 --> 00:47:40,451
Changing uniforms has
taught me one lesson.

524
00:47:41,468 --> 00:47:43,629
A man only owes one loyalty...

525
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:46,039
...to himself.

526
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:50,242
Come on, Bodine. We're ready to go.

527
00:47:50,277 --> 00:47:53,474
All right head on out,
I'll be with you in a minute.

528
00:47:53,509 --> 00:47:56,198
Higgins, pick up that loose stuff.
- All right.

529
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,703
This is your idea, Captain.

530
00:48:36,202 --> 00:48:39,148
You ordered the last man to stay
with the wagon...

531
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:41,265
...till it was blown to hell.

532
00:48:42,618 --> 00:48:44,461
Well, you're the last man.

533
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:54,176
See you in hell, Captain Sir.

534
00:49:04,445 --> 00:49:05,662
Sergeant!

535
00:49:07,303 --> 00:49:08,930
Sergeant, can you hear me?

536
00:49:11,005 --> 00:49:12,233
Yes, sir...

537
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:15,939
I can hear you.

538
00:49:17,272 --> 00:49:19,433
I can see, too.

539
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:25,244
Listen, I, my rope is tied to the
wagon but I don't think yours is.

540
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:27,993
Can you roll away from here?

541
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:40,655
I'm sorry, sir. I, I can't make it.

542
00:51:09,582 --> 00:51:12,858
It's a long way to Apache Wells,
Sergeant, think you can make it?

543
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:16,389
I sure don't want to stay here, sir.

544
00:51:59,371 --> 00:52:01,532
You're going to have to rest.

545
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,657
Now, don't you go passing out on me.

546
00:52:22,561 --> 00:52:25,701
I won't pass out on you, Captain.
Just keep talking to me.

547
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:30,361
I don't know why you don't go ahead
and leave me here anyway I'm...

548
00:52:30,396 --> 00:52:31,972
I'm slowing you down.

549
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:35,839
I know how determined you are
to get those guns.

550
00:52:35,874 --> 00:52:37,488
Now, you listen to me,

551
00:52:37,523 --> 00:52:40,265
we'll make it back together
or we won't make it at all.

552
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:53,058
You got more guts than
any man I ever knew.

553
00:52:53,093 --> 00:52:55,245
Must have been bred in you.

554
00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:00,802
Not exactly.

555
00:53:00,837 --> 00:53:03,988
Actually, I come from a long line
of losers, Sergeant.

556
00:53:06,432 --> 00:53:09,367
Matter of fact my family motto was,

557
00:53:09,402 --> 00:53:12,302
"If at first you don't succeed...

558
00:53:13,272 --> 00:53:14,489
"...give up".

559
00:53:19,617 --> 00:53:22,268
You sure switched that around
somewhere.

560
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,764
I tried to.

561
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:27,439
When I was nine years old,
I'll never forget that,

562
00:53:27,474 --> 00:53:29,131
big, old kid knocked me down.

563
00:53:29,166 --> 00:53:33,079
I just lay there and thought it'd
be safer, till he kicked me.

564
00:53:35,113 --> 00:53:38,870
Well, something must've popped
inside of me because I got up

565
00:53:38,905 --> 00:53:42,628
and fought back for the first time
in my life and I liked it.

566
00:53:44,129 --> 00:53:45,756
Did you whip him?

567
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:47,590
No.

568
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:50,469
No, he beat the tar out of me.

569
00:53:51,755 --> 00:53:53,643
But, I learnt something though.

570
00:53:55,486 --> 00:53:57,802
We're all going to die someday.

571
00:53:57,837 --> 00:54:02,171
It's better to die fighting than
lying with your face in the dirt.

572
00:54:04,362 --> 00:54:07,593
That sort of spirit sure made
a hell of a soldier out of you.

573
00:54:07,628 --> 00:54:12,398
Yeah, I knew I wanted the Army
when I was 15.

574
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:14,493
Ran away from home to join up.

575
00:54:14,528 --> 00:54:18,919
Clawed and scratched through the
ranks till I was a top cat like you.

576
00:54:18,954 --> 00:54:22,591
Of course, with my background
if it hadn't been for the war,

577
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,485
I'd never have made Officer.

578
00:54:25,615 --> 00:54:29,073
I won these bars fighting
in the field.

579
00:54:30,597 --> 00:54:33,566
There's going to be a star
there someday, Captain.

580
00:54:34,444 --> 00:54:37,834
There won't be anything there
if I don't get those rifles back.

581
00:54:38,811 --> 00:54:40,182
Yes, sir.

582
00:54:40,217 --> 00:54:41,554
Come on.

583
00:54:49,465 --> 00:54:51,057
I'm sorry, Captain.

584
00:54:56,203 --> 00:54:58,637
Looks like I'm going to
have to carry you.

585
00:55:42,868 --> 00:55:44,329
Now, look dead, will you?

586
00:55:44,364 --> 00:55:47,174
You couldn't have found
a better decoy!

587
00:55:53,064 --> 00:55:54,508
Here he comes.

588
00:57:20,405 --> 00:57:22,418
Colonel Reed.

589
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,070
Get him to the hospital tent!

590
00:57:42,919 --> 00:57:45,702
Sergeant Walker, Captain?
- Yes, sir.

591
00:57:45,737 --> 00:57:47,944
The guns and the rest of the men,
where are they?

592
00:57:47,979 --> 00:57:49,453
We lost them, sir.

593
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:52,198
Step inside, Captain.

594
00:57:59,124 --> 00:58:01,809
I want to see Captain Coburn.
- You can't see him now.

595
00:58:01,844 --> 00:58:03,117
But, I can't...

596
00:58:08,053 --> 00:58:11,762
No, Captain I won't allow another
mission to leave here.

597
00:58:11,797 --> 00:58:13,987
You said the Tonto Apache
were joining Cochise.

598
00:58:14,022 --> 00:58:15,631
What does that mean?

599
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:18,138
They're preparing for
an all-out attack.

600
00:58:18,173 --> 00:58:20,611
Exactly, and they might hit
any time.

601
00:58:20,612 --> 00:58:23,046
That's why we've got to have
those rifles.

602
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:24,710
I need every man here

603
00:58:24,745 --> 00:58:27,248
to have even an outside chance of
defending this place.

604
00:58:27,283 --> 00:58:30,480
I can't send half my command off
on some wild goose chase now.

605
00:58:30,515 --> 00:58:33,511
Then give me four men,
I'll get those rifles back.

606
00:58:33,546 --> 00:58:36,578
You had 11 when you lost them.

607
00:58:45,058 --> 00:58:46,867
That mean I can't go, Colonel?

608
00:58:47,755 --> 00:58:49,483
That's exactly what I mean!

609
00:58:49,518 --> 00:58:52,362
You failed once, Captain
and put us in deep trouble.

610
00:58:52,397 --> 00:58:55,147
One more failure would mean
certain disaster.

611
00:58:55,182 --> 00:58:57,070
Don't you understand?

612
00:58:57,105 --> 00:59:00,211
We've got the fight of our lives
trying to hold this place.

613
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:03,378
You see those people out there?

614
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:06,229
They were all depending on you.

615
00:59:07,398 --> 00:59:09,719
And they'll all be dead
this time tomorrow,

616
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:12,146
but by God we'll go down fighting.

617
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:16,597
And you're asking me to send
more troopers?!

618
00:59:16,632 --> 00:59:18,604
What's the matter with you?

619
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:27,294
I am relieving you
of your command, Captain.

620
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:31,121
You'll fight when we're hit but you
have no further authority here.

621
00:59:31,156 --> 00:59:34,914
If we survive, a court martial will
decide your future in the Army.

622
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:36,961
That will be all, Captain.

623
00:59:37,669 --> 00:59:40,240
I said, that will be all!

624
01:00:28,807 --> 01:00:29,887
Ellen!

625
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:43,447
Sorry, Ellen I wanted to
tell you myself.

626
01:00:44,434 --> 01:00:46,732
That'd make it a little easier
for you.

627
01:00:46,767 --> 01:00:48,051
Easier?

628
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:53,633
Both my brothers are gone and you're
going to make it easier for me.

629
01:00:55,394 --> 01:00:56,577
How?

630
01:00:57,999 --> 01:01:00,145
You said you'd watch out for them!

631
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:02,291
You promised to bring them back!

632
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:04,283
Why didn't you?

633
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:09,187
I tried. When the Apache hit,
I tried to put them in a safe place.

634
01:01:09,222 --> 01:01:10,911
A safe place?

635
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,809
You stand there without a scratch
yet both my brothers are dead

636
01:01:14,844 --> 01:01:17,248
and you left them in a safe place?!

637
01:01:19,462 --> 01:01:21,828
Ellen, didn't the Sergeant tell you?

638
01:01:21,863 --> 01:01:24,373
Doug's not dead, he's alive!

639
01:01:24,408 --> 01:01:26,979
Oh I don't believe you!
They're both dead.

640
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:29,687
No, they're not.

641
01:01:29,722 --> 01:01:32,236
Well then, where is he?
Where's Doug?

642
01:01:35,547 --> 01:01:38,471
He deserted, but he is alive.

643
01:01:40,015 --> 01:01:41,399
You're lying!

644
01:01:41,434 --> 01:01:44,380
Doug would never desert,
he's too loyal.

645
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:48,157
Oh, I knew I shouldn't have
let him join the Army.

646
01:01:48,192 --> 01:01:50,984
He wasn't the kind to make
a good soldier.

647
01:01:51,019 --> 01:01:53,776
He was so timid and didn't
like fighting.

648
01:01:54,792 --> 01:01:57,056
He couldn't even stand
the sight of blood.

649
01:01:58,367 --> 01:02:00,944
But, he'd never desert
Mother and me.

650
01:02:00,979 --> 01:02:03,522
It's true, Ellen, he went with them.

651
01:02:05,609 --> 01:02:08,919
Well, then they forced him to go.
They forced him!

652
01:02:08,954 --> 01:02:10,794
If he's alive I know he'd be back.

653
01:02:10,829 --> 01:02:14,469
Just as well get that out of
your mind, he's not coming back.

654
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:17,730
Why?

655
01:02:17,765 --> 01:02:21,235
Because he is a deserter and if
he comes back he'll be shot.

656
01:02:22,146 --> 01:02:24,000
You could, couldn't you?

657
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:27,828
You could shoot a poor,
frightened boy!

658
01:02:28,764 --> 01:02:32,074
Oh, it's funny how blind
I have been about you.

659
01:02:33,168 --> 01:02:37,707
It's funny I didn't see it long ago
the way that you force your men,

660
01:02:37,742 --> 01:02:40,587
expecting them to be
as strong as you are!

661
01:02:40,622 --> 01:02:43,433
Well, you're cruel, Bruce,
cruel and brutal!

662
01:02:44,878 --> 01:02:47,367
The way you beat up that man
coming up here!

663
01:02:47,402 --> 01:02:51,423
You beat his face to a pulp because
he wanted a dipper of water?!

664
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:55,409
Oh, it's funny I didn't see then
how truly heartless you are.

665
01:02:55,444 --> 01:02:59,756
No wonder Doug ran off, no wonder
they all went, you drove them to it!

666
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:02,676
They ran off to get away from you.

667
01:03:02,711 --> 01:03:04,231
Now, just a minute!

668
01:03:05,034 --> 01:03:06,916
Maybe I did make a mistake,

669
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:09,317
but you might as well hear
all of the story.

670
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:12,531
Doug didn't desert
to get away from me.

671
01:03:12,566 --> 01:03:15,620
He could've saved Mike's life
and he didn't do it.

672
01:03:15,655 --> 01:03:20,297
He didn't want to come back and
face you, that's why he deserted.

673
01:03:20,332 --> 01:03:23,805
No. No!

674
01:03:35,658 --> 01:03:37,840
Coburn knew that because of
his failure

675
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:40,661
the entire camp could be
overrun by the Apaches.

676
01:03:40,696 --> 01:03:43,409
The Colonel had ordered him
confined to post

677
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:47,187
but a heavy weight of guilt made him
decide to disobey that order

678
01:03:47,222 --> 01:03:50,055
and take the gamble of going alone
after the guns.

679
01:03:53,432 --> 01:03:54,698
Soldier.

680
01:03:54,733 --> 01:03:55,919
Yes, sir?

681
01:03:55,954 --> 01:03:57,581
I need your sidearm.

682
01:04:01,156 --> 01:04:03,716
Do you mind saddling that horse?
- Yes, sir.

683
01:04:54,655 --> 01:04:58,079
The Captain hoped to pick up the
track of the rifles by daybreak.

684
01:05:13,714 --> 01:05:17,096
He studied the trail taken
by the deserters.

685
01:05:17,131 --> 01:05:19,736
At least he had a fresh horse
for the search ahead.

686
01:05:42,929 --> 01:05:44,476
Whoa!

687
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:50,892
Your pack horse just about had it.

688
01:05:50,927 --> 01:05:53,122
Riding all night through
these mountains,

689
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:54,656
I bet we didn't cover ten miles.

690
01:05:54,691 --> 01:05:58,024
That's right, Fuller, we didn't
run into any Apache, either.

691
01:05:59,194 --> 01:06:04,382
Now look, we'll hole up here,
hide our v aluable merchandise.

692
01:06:04,417 --> 01:06:06,860
You keep talking about how
v aluable these are.

693
01:06:06,895 --> 01:06:09,258
I wonder if we'll live long enough
to cash them in.

694
01:06:09,293 --> 01:06:12,433
Know what your trouble is, Higgins?
You don't have any faith in me.

695
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,969
Yeah, it about sums it up.

696
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:16,177
Give me a hand here, hold it up.

697
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:22,085
You treat all this stuff
with love and care, boys.

698
01:06:23,943 --> 01:06:27,572
This here rifle I'm holding...

699
01:06:28,691 --> 01:06:32,787
...is worth a thousand dollars
in pure, raw gold.

700
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,875
Ooh-wee!

701
01:06:35,926 --> 01:06:38,436
Yeah but worth's one thing,
getting's another.

702
01:06:38,471 --> 01:06:40,908
Don't you worry about that, Higgins,
I'll get it.

703
01:06:40,943 --> 01:06:44,834
I'll get a thousand dollars apiece
for these rifles, maybe more.

704
01:06:49,633 --> 01:06:50,795
See, boys...

705
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:54,891
...I'm a first-class salesman,
a travelling salesman.

706
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,198
This here's my sample case.

707
01:06:59,135 --> 01:07:02,318
How far you travelling, Bodine?
- Oh, not too far.

708
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:05,502
My best customer is up
in those hills somewhere.

709
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:10,662
Cochise?

710
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:12,625
That's right, boy.

711
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:15,231
Apache gold is what I'm dealing for.

712
01:07:16,352 --> 01:07:19,158
You said we were going to sell
those guns in Mexico!

713
01:07:19,193 --> 01:07:21,965
What's the matter, sonny,
you getting cold feet?

714
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,977
Want to go back... to a firing squad?

715
01:07:25,012 --> 01:07:27,713
I'll be glad to dump these rifles.

716
01:07:27,748 --> 01:07:30,370
We can start making better time.

717
01:07:30,405 --> 01:07:33,715
Our next stop will be Mexico where
all those senoritas hang out.

718
01:07:34,553 --> 01:07:37,868
Yeah, and ol' Cochise's next stop
will be Apache Wells.

719
01:07:37,903 --> 01:07:41,183
Well, I'm glad you boys are
beginning to appreciate

720
01:07:41,218 --> 01:07:43,051
just how well I use this
head of mine.

721
01:07:43,086 --> 01:07:44,745
What are you talking about?

722
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:47,351
Ha, the Army will be too busy
fighting Cochise

723
01:07:47,386 --> 01:07:48,807
to send anybody chasing us.

724
01:07:49,938 --> 01:07:53,192
You already got the Army wiped out
and you ain't even found Cochise.

725
01:07:53,227 --> 01:07:56,854
There you go worrying again,
Higgins. I won't have to find him.

726
01:07:56,889 --> 01:07:59,070
I get close enough,
his braves will find me.

727
01:07:59,105 --> 01:08:02,597
They'll cut your throat before you
get a chance to talk to him.

728
01:08:02,632 --> 01:08:05,445
Oh no, this is my insurance.

729
01:08:06,547 --> 01:08:09,061
He needs these guns a lot more
than he needs my scalp.

730
01:08:09,096 --> 01:08:10,597
Keep a sharp lookout.

731
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:13,556
Time enough to let down after
we get across the border.

732
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:15,055
Come on, let's go.

733
01:08:22,872 --> 01:08:26,330
Sonny boy, you take care
of the horses.

734
01:08:26,365 --> 01:08:28,820
Listen, I'm going to go up there
and pick me out a spot.

735
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:32,336
Why don't you all go around the
other side, you know, just in case.

736
01:08:32,371 --> 01:08:33,881
Good idea.

737
01:09:40,088 --> 01:09:43,251
The Captain would have given anything
to get a crack at Bodine,

738
01:09:43,286 --> 01:09:46,058
but recovering the guns was
his prime concern now.

739
01:10:16,497 --> 01:10:18,834
Bodine was hurried up
into the mountains

740
01:10:18,869 --> 01:10:21,171
where Cochise waited with
a party of braves.

741
01:10:56,986 --> 01:11:00,865
Soldier, you are a very brave man...

742
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:03,825
...or a fool.

743
01:11:06,355 --> 01:11:09,074
I'm neither one, just a hunter...

744
01:11:10,023 --> 01:11:11,923
...out after big game.

745
01:11:12,805 --> 01:11:17,606
The hunter was captured by the game
he was seeking.

746
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:22,205
It's the only way I could get to
see the mighty Cochise.

747
01:11:22,775 --> 01:11:24,638
The Army insults me!

748
01:11:24,673 --> 01:11:28,038
Sending an underling to parlay!

749
01:11:28,073 --> 01:11:31,365
Nobody sent me, I came on my own.

750
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,472
The White Eyes do not let
their soldiers ride alone

751
01:11:34,507 --> 01:11:36,197
through the Chiricahuas.

752
01:11:37,299 --> 01:11:39,620
Nobody gave me permission to come.

753
01:11:39,655 --> 01:11:41,896
Then you deserter.

754
01:11:45,608 --> 01:11:47,587
If you want to call it that.

755
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:55,778
A man who turns on his friends
cannot be trusted by his enemies.

756
01:11:56,648 --> 01:11:58,320
We will talk no more.

757
01:12:00,433 --> 01:12:02,756
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute!

758
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:05,080
I'm not asking you to trust me.

759
01:13:00,553 --> 01:13:02,137
You have more of these?

760
01:13:02,172 --> 01:13:06,006
40 rifles, 40,000 in gold...

761
01:13:06,942 --> 01:13:08,193
...if you want them.

762
01:13:11,826 --> 01:13:13,327
Show me the rifles.

763
01:13:16,004 --> 01:13:20,043
I am not like your people,
my word can be trusted.

764
01:13:21,823 --> 01:13:24,421
When I see the rifles,

765
01:13:24,456 --> 01:13:28,768
you will get the Apache gold that
means so much to the White Eyes.

766
01:13:52,537 --> 01:13:55,904
Coburn trailed the deserters back to
where they stood guard over the guns

767
01:13:55,939 --> 01:13:57,764
waiting for Bodine's return.

768
01:15:14,253 --> 01:15:17,029
Higgins, get away from him!
Let me get a shot at him.

769
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,112
Now, let's go
get us an Apache.

770
01:15:24,147 --> 01:15:27,544
I'm scared, Mike.
I'm scared!

771
01:15:29,281 --> 01:15:31,715
I never should have joined the Army.

772
01:15:32,999 --> 01:15:34,853
Get out of the way, Higgins.

773
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:38,318
That's no excuse.

774
01:15:38,353 --> 01:15:40,662
I've got no use
for a coward.

775
01:15:40,697 --> 01:15:42,177
Captain!

776
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:51,055
Captain!

777
01:16:12,637 --> 01:16:15,003
Get him up, get him off of me!

778
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:13,084
Doug.

779
01:17:51,285 --> 01:17:52,832
That kid!

780
01:17:54,457 --> 01:17:56,197
I should have known.

781
01:17:56,198 --> 01:17:57,757
The guns!

782
01:17:57,792 --> 01:17:59,783
Where are they?
- Now look!

783
01:18:03,121 --> 01:18:08,548
He say, two men ride away
with horses.

784
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:11,725
We will follow.

785
01:18:13,525 --> 01:18:17,746
But, if this is a trick,
YOU will be the first to die.

786
01:18:33,424 --> 01:18:35,593
Cochise knew he must
keep those rifles

787
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:38,199
from reaching the cav alry
at Apache Wells.

788
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:59,968
It's no use trying to outrun them
dragging these pack horses.

789
01:19:04,269 --> 01:19:06,112
Give me a hand, will you, Doug?

790
01:19:08,594 --> 01:19:10,857
You going to fight them here, sir?

791
01:19:10,892 --> 01:19:13,850
I'll try slow them down, it's up to
you to get the rifles through.

792
01:19:13,885 --> 01:19:16,802
But, I won't leave you
here alone, Captain.

793
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:21,090
You're going to obey orders, soldier.
- Yes, sir.

794
01:19:23,004 --> 01:19:26,007
Sure feels good fighting on
the right side for a change.

795
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:30,615
Come on, help me load these.
- Yes, sir.

796
01:19:44,147 --> 01:19:46,672
Better get going, hadn't you, Doug?
- Yes, sir.

797
01:20:14,339 --> 01:20:16,079
Hup. Hup!

798
01:20:19,141 --> 01:20:20,897
With five guns,

799
01:20:20,932 --> 01:20:24,504
Coburn hoped to buy enough time
for Doug to get to Apache Wells.

800
01:21:36,478 --> 01:21:37,900
It's Coburn.

801
01:21:38,991 --> 01:21:40,435
It's Coburn!

802
01:21:42,662 --> 01:21:45,438
Wait a minute, Chief, it's no trick.

803
01:21:46,218 --> 01:21:49,187
I've got the same rifle he has,
I'll get him out of there for you.

804
01:21:49,188 --> 01:21:51,133
I'll get those rifles for you.

805
01:22:33,151 --> 01:22:34,891
At ease, soldier.

806
01:22:35,715 --> 01:22:37,512
There are your rifles, Colonel.

807
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:41,551
Break them out.
Issue one to each man.

808
01:22:42,485 --> 01:22:45,966
Captain Coburn stayed behind
to fight off the Indians, sir.

809
01:22:46,001 --> 01:22:47,891
Alone?
- Yes, sir.

810
01:22:49,059 --> 01:22:51,038
He wouldn't let me stay.

811
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:54,031
He said it's the only way we could
get the guns through.

812
01:22:57,215 --> 01:22:59,160
He could still be alive.

813
01:23:00,373 --> 01:23:01,579
Corporal.

814
01:23:06,365 --> 01:23:09,550
Captain Coburn's in trouble.
I need some volunteers. Mount up.

815
01:23:12,548 --> 01:23:14,391
Think you can ride, son?

816
01:23:16,011 --> 01:23:17,545
Yes, sir!

817
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:19,079
Go get him.

818
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:23,144
Yes, sir.

819
01:26:28,728 --> 01:26:32,403
Bodine was caught between the Army
and hostile Apaches.

820
01:26:32,438 --> 01:26:35,294
All he could do was try to
save his own hide now.

821
01:27:30,306 --> 01:27:31,625
Hyah!

822
01:28:04,976 --> 01:28:06,616
Yes, sir.

823
01:28:06,651 --> 01:28:08,257
Captain sir.

824
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:01,187
Captain Coburn?

825
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:04,064
Captain Coburn?

826
01:29:11,452 --> 01:29:14,012
Everything's all right, Doug.

827
01:29:16,104 --> 01:29:18,265
Everything's going to be all right.

828
01:29:30,069 --> 01:29:31,832
Attention!

829
01:29:40,454 --> 01:29:41,660
Forward!

830
01:29:42,751 --> 01:29:44,287
Ho!

831
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:09,120
Go ahead, Doug.

832
01:30:13,054 --> 01:30:14,476
Oh, Doug!

833
01:30:16,294 --> 01:30:17,567
Good work, Captain.

834
01:30:17,602 --> 01:30:20,275
For once I am glad you
disobeyed orders.

835
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:21,605
So, am I, sir.

836
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,653
The boy made the difference.

837
01:30:31,102 --> 01:30:33,616
Go ahead, Captain.
