Narrator: <i>montana territory, 1 879,</i>
<i>where cattle was king.</i>

2
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:04,876
<i>Where the law was a gun...</i>

3
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:07,676
<i>... and the men who drove the great herds</i>
<i>up from texas...</i>

4
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:09,375
<i>... made the rules.</i>

5
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:13,044
<i>They were hard men.</i>
<i>They had to be hard to keep alive.</i>

6
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:16,556
<i>The ground they took with their guns,</i>
<i>they held with their guns.</i>

7
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:19,559
<i>Held it against the indians.</i>

8
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,493
<i>Held it against cattle rustlers.</i>

9
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:26,931
<i>It was theirs by right of conquest.</i>
<i>They meant to keep it.</i>

10
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:30,600
<i>Then came what they believed</i>
<i>was a new enemy.</i>

11
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:33,038
<i>It came as a slow white tide...</i>

12
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:37,646
<i>... rolling north from the prairies</i>
<i>toward the grasslands of montana.</i>

13
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:39,406
<i>Sheep.</i>

14
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:43,382
<i>And with the sheep rode men</i>
<i>who also lived by their gun.</i>

15
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:47,717
<i>They swept north slowly, steadily...</i>

16
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:52,988
<i>... searching for range, grass, water.</i>

17
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:56,760
<i>Cattlemen claimed</i>
<i>there was death in this tide.</i>

18
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:00,494
<i>They said no steer could live</i>
<i>where a sheep had grazed.</i>

19
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:03,097
<i>They warned the sheepmen to keep off.</i>

20
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,636
<i>Then they turned to their guns</i>
<i>and there was war.</i>

21
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:11,770
<i>They rolled back the first attack</i>
<i>and buried the sheepmen where they fell.</i>

22
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:15,080
<i>They buried some of their own too...</i>

23
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:17,981
<i>... and marked the spots for all to see.</i>

24
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:20,889
<i>They put up signs as a warning.</i>

25
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,491
<i>Signs that promised death</i>
<i>to any sheepman...</i>

26
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,426
<i>... who might look at this ground</i>
<i>and want it for his own.</i>

27
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:31,559
<i>And that's how it was</i>
<i>when morgan lane rode north years later...</i>

28
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:35,534
<i>... driving his sheep</i>
<i>into the cattle lands of montana.</i>

30
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,286
Man:
What's on yon sign, mr. Lane?

31
00:03:01,464 --> 00:03:03,694
Oh, it's sort of a friendly warning, mac.

32
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:07,098
It says that any sheepman
crossing this point will get shot on sight.

33
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,535
Mackenzie: What are you gonna do?
- We're going across. What else can we do?

34
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:11,731
Wait a minute, laddie.

35
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:14,376
The sheep's all played out
and they need water.

36
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:18,480
- The nearest river is five miles ahead.
- The sheep can't go a step further this day.

37
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:20,275
We'll have to bed down dry for the night.

38
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,941
Well, it will not be the first time.

39
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,485
And you call montana the promised land.

40
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,479
That's what it is to me, mac.

41
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:29,522
I promised myself
i'd come back here one day...

42
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:32,058
...ever since the cattlemen
drove my father off the range.

43
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:36,062
Australia, where your father took you,
is a fine, fine country for sheep, mr. Lane.

44
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:39,759
It would have been far better to have
stayed there from the look of this.

45
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:44,236
Not me, mac. This time, i'm here to stay.
Well, cheer up.

46
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:46,739
Tomorrow night, you can wet your whistle
at fort humboldt.

47
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,075
I'll be wetting my whistle tonight, mr. Lane,
if it's all the same to you.

48
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,548
- Where did you dig that up?
- San francisco.

49
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:59,084
I purchased it the day before we left.

50
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:01,621
And you mean to tell me
you've had that all that time?

51
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:06,421
Aye. Come desert and mountain,
rain and blizzard...

52
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:09,622
...i've treasured this bonny wee bottle
in my bedroll.

53
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,266
And you know something, mr. Lane?

54
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:15,666
When you laddies were freezing,
the very thought of this kept me warm.

55
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,365
So long as you're gonna open it up tonight,
i better start rounding up the boys.

56
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:22,875
- Hey, fellas!
- Mr. Lane, mr. Lane. Please, mr. Lane.

57
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:25,674
Mr. Lane, let's talk this over,
friend to friend.

58
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,715
Laddie, there's barely enough
for the two of us.

59
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:32,821
Mr. Lane, you cannot do this to me.

You're not implying that they don't exactly
care for sheepmen around here, are you?

108
00:09:56,545 --> 00:10:00,675
- Mm-hm. Only to shoot at.
- Uh-huh. How do they feel about peddlers?

If i don't sell sheep dip for sale,
i'm welcome. I hope.

just for the looks of it?

of your adopted country.

we might purchase something.

Man: No.

132
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:11,944
No. I will tell you what.

133
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,988
The hat, you don't want,
the shirt, you don't want.

134
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:18,718
The boots, you don't want. The fine
imported music box, you don't want.

135
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:20,862

you do want.

137
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:27,359

the boots, the shirt or anything else.

138

Mackenzie: Name your price for the bird.

139
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:35,400
I let him go for $2 and i lose $2. no.

140
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:39,576
Let him go for $ 1 and you'll only lose $ 1.

141
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:42,081
Papa:
That's better. All right, $ 1.

142
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,844
I would starve in scotland.

143
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:49,718
Well, you have the bird.
Take care of the bird.

Mac, be sure you keep the sheep
well-bunched.

151
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:20,822
- Don't let anybody on horseback near them.
- All right, mr. Lane.

152
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,651
Come on, papa. Hurry up. Hurry up.

153
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:41,741
Sheepmen don't talk much, no?

154
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:44,311
Hmm? No.

155
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:47,842
Peddlers talk too much, yes?

156
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,182
Yup.

157
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,512
- Then i keep quiet.
- Good.

158
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,585
You have no pistol gun?

159
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:02,219
- No what?
- You don't carry a boom-boom? No?

160
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:05,765
No. I don't like them.
They make me nervous.

161
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:07,596
Uh-huh.

162
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,901
You are going to shoot the murderer
who killed your men?

163
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,807
Mm-hm. I see. Later, later.

164
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:22,417
You've got another business before?

165
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:24,449
Mm-hm.

166
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:28,949
You're kind of curious, aren't you, papa?

167
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:32,787
So am i. I wanna find out
what's wrong with sheep.

168
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:35,793
I think sheep are pretty important
in the world.

169
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,031
I'd like to know
why a few cattle barons in montana...

170
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:44,366
...think they can keep sheep
off the open range.

171
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:49,504
Morgan:
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

172
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:51,009
[Bell ringing]

173
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,239
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen...

174
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,940
...and listen to one of the most
amazing discoveries...

175
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:57,710
...of the medical world.

176
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,355
None other than dr. Otto schwartz's...

177
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:06,086
- schultz. Schultz.
- Dr. Schultz's amazing "tiger-marrow fat."

178
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,493
Extracted from the wild beast
in its native lair.

179
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:14,728
And, as the doctor will testify,
it cures every human ailment.

180
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:16,997
It cures..."fallen arches"?

181
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,367
"Fallen arches, flat feet,
warts, corns, bunions.

182
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:25,412
And it also cleans and tightens
loose teeth."

183
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:51,837
Remember, reeves,
have the boys back at the ranch at 4:00.

184
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:55,340
- And try to stay out of trouble.
Reeves: We'll do our best, miss singleton.

185
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:57,502
[Men hollering]

186
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:13,887
Who are they?
They act like they own the town.

187
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:15,860
They do,
and most of the range around here.

188
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:18,591
That's maria singleton and rod ackroyd.

189
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:23,905
Come on, sheriff.

190
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,201
[Bell ringing]

191
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:34,205
[Fiddle playing]

192
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:39,714
[Singing]
<i>Oh, dan, he went down to the mill</i>

193
00:15:39,888 --> 00:15:43,722
<i>to get some corn to have his fill</i>

194
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:47,225
<i>the miller swore by the point of his knife</i>

195
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:51,628
<i>he never saw such a man in his life</i>

196
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,461
<i>so</i>

197
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:57,970
all [singing]:
<i>Get out the way, old dan tucker</i>

198
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,270
<i>get out the way, old dan tucker</i>
<i>you're too late to come to supper</i>

199
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:03,468
- <i>supper</i>
- <i>supper</i>

200
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:06,638
- <i>supper</i>
- <i>supper</i>

201
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,011
[cheering]

202
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:16,623
- Those boys are pretty good, aren't they?
- Yeah, very good.

203
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:18,851
Go on, reeves,
tell about that fight you had.

204
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:20,495
Well, sheriff, i tell you...

205
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:22,790
...you should have seen
them sheepherders run.

206
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:24,262
All but one of them.

207
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:27,800
It sure breaks my heart every time
i hear of a sheepherder getting killed.

208
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,301
[All laugh]

209
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:32,565
Well, i don't like shooting,
but this is cattle country.

210
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,709
Maybe it will learn them
they ain't wanted here.

211
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:37,744
- Thanks for the drink, slim.
- You're welcome, sheriff.

212
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:41,543
Hello, stranger.
You're new here, ain't you?

213
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:45,118
Oh, sort of, sheriff.
But i get acquainted fast.

214
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:47,915
- Well, be sure you meet the right people.
- Oh, sure.

215
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,320
That goes for both of us.

216
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,737
- Give me some whiskey, will you?
Bartender: What kind?

217
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:04,600
Drinking whiskey.

218
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:08,607
- Do you boys care to join me?
- Why not?

219
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,836
Whiskey's whiskey,
no matter who pays for it.

220
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:13,573
You never said a truer word.
Fill them up, will you?

221
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:18,185
What's your business, mister?

222
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,387
- I'm a peddler.
Reeves: Peddler?

223
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,222
Yeah, wagon's down the street.
Well, good luck.

224
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,903
- Hear you fellows had a little trouble.
- You heard wrong. Not us.

225
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:38,505
Them sheepherders and the sheep
had the trouble.

226
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:39,868
Oh.

227
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:44,138
Say, i'm a stranger around these parts.
Uh, like to ask a question.

228
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,113
- What's wrong with sheep?
- What's wrong with sheep?

229
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:50,945
Hey, listen, this dude wants to know
what's wrong with sheep.

230
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,781
[All laugh]

231
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:59,390
- I'd like to know what's wrong.
Co yne: I'll tell you, mister.

232
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:02,860
They chew up the grass by the roots
so it won't never grow again.

233
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,191
Did you ever smell them?

234
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,766
Cattle won't set foot
where a sheep's been.

235
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:09,563
Hmm. That's funny.

236
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:12,229
Just across the border,
i saw plenty of sheep and cattle...

237
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:13,897
...getting along together fine.

238
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:18,570
No trouble at all. Around here,
there seems to be plenty of room for both.

239
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:28,682
You talk like a sheepherder.

240
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:33,956
- How does a sheepherder talk?
- Like you're talking now.

241
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:36,097
I'm asking you again,
what's your business?

242
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:38,995
I'm telling you again. I'm a peddler.

243
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:42,767
You're all dressed up, but you're
a dead ringer for one of them dirt-eaters...

244
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:44,667
...we traded shots with last night.

245
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,937
- Where's your gun?
- I don't carry a gun.

246
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,170
Some men don't carry them in gun country
because they're afraid.

247
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,737
That's right.

248
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:58,010
Tecumseh: Ordinarily, i don't get
mixed up in other men's feuding.

249
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:02,252
But i couldn't help
but overhear you talking.

250
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:05,951
Son, that trigger's tied back
with rawhide...

251
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:10,360
...and if you don't know
how to fan a gun, don't put it on.

252
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:17,866
Either buckle on that gun
or get out of town.

253
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,860
All right, my friend.
Start counting, will you?

254
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:51,404
When you get to three, we'll shoot.

255
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,738
One.

256
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:02,407
Two.

257
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,152
Morgan:
You never learned to count, mr. Reeves?

258
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:17,690
Now, pick up that gun
and we'll start all over.

259
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,568
I take back what i said.

260
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,498
No sheepherder
can draw and fire like that.

261
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,441
Will you have a drink with me?

262
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,310
I do believe i will.
Very neighborly of you.

263
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:38,744
The man's buying, fellows.

264
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:41,879
[Men chattering]

265
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,487
- How about that same song?
- Through with that gun of mine, son?

266
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,824
Oh, yeah, thanks a lot.
Sure shoots fast, doesn't it?

267
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,295
Bartender: What will you have?
- Just a drink of whiskey.

268
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:53,457
[Men chattering]

269
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:55,730
[Bell ringing]

270
00:20:56,905 --> 00:21:00,272
Lady, please, please, just for a moment.
Come back. Come back.

271
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:04,469
Look, lady, this is a antimacassar.
You lay it back on the chair like this.

272
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:07,706
Your husband lays his head back like this.

273
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:10,943
And it catches the macassar oil
from his hair.

274
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,713
He don't use macassar oil on his hair
no more

275
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:16,653
then i sell you a bottle.
Fine macassar oil, no?

276
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:18,417
He ain't got no hair, neither.

277
00:21:18,593 --> 00:21:21,153
Oh, wonderful.
Then he needs a fine toupee.

278
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,957
Camel hair, huh?

279
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:27,124
Mister, i laid my husband under the sod
seven years ago

280
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:30,100
...come 4th of july.

281
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,171
Better for him.

282
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,270
See you back at the ranch, maria.

283
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,472
Sober, i hope.

284
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:59,859
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Papa schultz's wagon's open.

285
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:03,004
- Where are the customers?
- You got any musical instruments?

286
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:05,401
I'm looking for a guitar.

287
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,475
Guitars we ain't got.
Guitars we never have.

288
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:13,103
But maybe i can offer you something else.
Look, look, madam, i have music boxes.

289
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:16,307
- A fine imported music box.
- No, thanks. Nothing else.

290
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,881
Good morning, miss singleton.

291
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,615
- Find what you wanted?
- No, i was looking for a guitar.

292
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:26,124
A guitar?

293
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:29,092
Papa, didn't i tell you in chicago
you should order guitars?

294
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,028
You tell me in chicago?
You tell me nothing in chicago.

295
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,067
I'm sorry, miss singleton.
We'll order one specially for you.

296
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:38,331
Never mind. By the time it got here,
i'd forget i ever wanted it.

297
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:42,341
- Say, i'm curious about something, mister.
- Oh?

298
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:44,570
How'd you know my name?

299
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:48,876
Well, i'll tell you.
I was curious, too, so i asked someone.

300
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:51,542
Curiosity killed the cat, you know,
mister, uh?

301
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,314
Lane. Morgan lane, ma'am.

302
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:56,881
Good day, mr. Lane.

303
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:24,545
- Make yourself at home.
- Always do.

304
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:30,255
- Don't think i got your name.
- Tecumseh.

305
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,487
Mine's lane.

306
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:36,859
Mr. Lane, i figured out your brand.

307
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:38,124
Have you?

308
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,237
You had a killer's look in your eye when you
stood up to reeves in that saloon today.

309
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:45,969
You knew that cowpoke killed your man...

310
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:49,239
...and you were out
to square accounts with him.

311
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,702
What do you want?

312
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,010
Well, a sheepman is poison
in this country...

313
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:59,449
...and i'm the only one that knows
for certain that you're one of them.

314
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:04,122
And i'm out of drinking money.

315
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,220
Oh.

316
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,824
Well, i tell you, tecumseh, i'm sort of...

317
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:13,763
...short of drinking money myself,
but, uh...

318
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:19,470
...think that will keep your mouth shut?

319
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,900
Till it runs out.

320
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:24,776
Well, try to make it last, will you?

321
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:29,140
Mister, i ain't no sheepman...

322
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:32,753
...but i sure admired the way
you handled yourself in the little big horn.

323
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:35,355
But don't crowd your luck.
Thought i'd tell you.

324
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:36,957
Thanks.

325
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:40,788
- Say, you been around this country long?
- Since '51.

326
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:43,123
The buffaloes and the injuns run it then.

327
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:44,629
[Chuckles]

328
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,028
Ackroyd and singleton run it now, huh?

329
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:53,139
Yup. And what they don't hold,
the forsythe company does.

330
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:57,938
Between the three of them, they just about
put the little cattlemen out of business.

331
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,975
Going someplace?

332
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:02,912
I'm gonna ride to singleton ranch,
see that girl and her partner.

333
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,917
You're a dead man already, mister.

334
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,123
Too bad.

335
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:16,990
A nice young fella too.

[Neighs]

337
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:48,993
I don't see what makes you think
you have to outshoot...

338
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:51,860
...outdrink and outride every man
in the territory.

339
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:55,525
For the same reason makes you put on airs
because your name happens to be singleton.

340
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:57,604
All right, turn him loose.

341
00:25:57,772 --> 00:25:59,763
[Men cheering]

342
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:27,929
You hurt, boss?

343
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:30,594
Huh? No, i'm all right.

344
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,670
Sooner you find out that horse'll kill
anybody that tries to ride him...

345
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:43,181
...the better off you're gonna be.
- Lf i don't kill him first.

346
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:58,391
Miss maria, you'd better marry that man
while he's still in one piece.

347
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:01,057
Maybe i could handle him better
if he was broken up a little.

348
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:03,898
He'll never be gentle, that's sure.
Or you, either.

00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:05,733
[Knocking on door]

350
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:09,300
Oh, how do you do?

351
00:27:09,477 --> 00:27:10,967
- Is miss singleton here?
- What is it?

352
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:13,842
- I, uh, brought this out to show...
- we don't want any.

353
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:16,643
- Yes, but miss singleton ordered it.
- We still don't want any.

354
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:18,581
- Just...
maria: Who is it, kitty?

355
00:27:18,753 --> 00:27:21,654
- It's a man with a...
- guitar.

356
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:24,018
Maria: A man with a what?
- Guitar.

357
00:27:24,192 --> 00:27:26,626
- Hello, miss singleton.
- Oh, the peddler.

358
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:28,023
Uh-huh.

359
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:31,131
You see, by a strange coincidence,
after you left town today...

360
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:34,132
...i started rummaging
through our music department.

361
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:37,931
And what do you think i found? A guitar.

362
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:41,676
- Won't you come in?
- Why, thank you very much.

363
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:46,446
Well?

364
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:49,741
Maria: Nice tone.
- Thanks.

365
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,684
- Oh, wait till you hear it when it's tuned.
- But it doesn't look new.

366
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:56,718
New? Well, i should hope not.

367
00:27:56,891 --> 00:28:00,452
- This is probably 1 25 years old.
- That's what i thought.

368
00:28:00,628 --> 00:28:03,995
Perhaps you're not aware, madam,
that guitars are something like violins.

369
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:06,292
The older the instrument,
the sweeter the tone.

370
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:09,665
As a matter of fact,
you happen to be looking at a genuine...

371
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:12,033
a genuine gonzales papa schultz.

372
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:14,300
Don't be foolish. It's a lyon & healy.

373
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:16,569
Mrs. Maynard's husband was a musician.

374
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:18,076
Oh.

375
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,480
- Congratulations.
- He blew the bugle at gettysburg.

376
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:23,674
Did he?
Well, now, that's very interesting.

377
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:25,342
You know something, mrs. Maynard?

378
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,012
I've always been of the opinion that
the blowing of that bugle at gettysburg...

379
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,021
...was the main factor
in the union victory.

380
00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:33,820
My husband was on the confederate side.

381
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:35,087
Didn't i say confederate?

382
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:38,164
Maria:
After that one, i think you'll need a drink.

383
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:41,769
- Well, if you insist.
Maria: Kitty?

384
00:28:45,907 --> 00:28:50,173
- So, uh, you're a peddler, mr. Lane?
- Among other things.

385
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:53,746
And you rode all the way out here
to sell me a guitar?

386
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:55,246
Among other things.

387
00:28:55,717 --> 00:28:58,880
Heard about you beating reeves
to the draw yesterday.

388
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:01,112
Pretty fast with a gun, aren't you?

389
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,758
- Among...
- yeah, i know. Among other things.

390
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:08,191
- Just who are you? Where are you from?
- Originally, australia.

391
00:29:08,363 --> 00:29:10,160
Recently, california.

00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,424
What are you doing in montana?

393
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:16,404
Frankly, i'd like to live here.
I'd like to buy some land.

394
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:18,971
You've come to the wrong section.
We're not selling.

395
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,768
That's too bad.
Have you thought of the advantages...

396
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:23,934
...of having me for a neighbor,
miss singleton?

397
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:27,946
Why, i could even teach you the guitar.
Among other things, of course.

398
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:30,346
It's not a question of wanting you.

399
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,385
It's just that we don't take kindly
to strangers, that's all.

Oh, but i had no intention
of remaining a stranger, if you don't mind.

the imperial canadian cattle company.

He's my neighbor on the south
and rod's my neighbor on the north.

I see. Tell me, how did you ever
come to settle in montana?

00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:13,780
When the homesteaders
overran our property in texas...

448
00:32:13,948 --> 00:32:16,542
...our families just packed up
and moved to montana.

449
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:19,846
Our families have held this range
ever since 1 87 1...

450
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,886
...and we intend to go on holding it.

Is it too late to congratulate you?

456
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:38,904
Mr. Lane's not interested
in our personal affairs, rod.

457
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:42,509
He's looking for some range land
for himself.

458
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:45,168
Why don't we sell him
the bear creek range?

459
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:46,404
We never use it.

460
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:49,607
What makes you think mr. Lane
could run a cattle outfit?

461
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:52,976
Come right down to it,
what makes you think i couldn't?

462
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:57,451
Running a cattle spread is a man's job.

463
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,490
- Rod.
- Oh.

464
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:01,595
You'll have to excuse rod, mr. Lane.

465
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:06,063
- He's just had a bad time with a horse.
- Oh, sure, that's all right.

466
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,328
Matter of fact, i always did think
horses knew a lot about human nature.

467
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:11,131
What do you mean by that?

468
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:15,105
Well, for instance, i think they know
who can handle them and who can't.

469
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:19,303
Another very important factor is once you
get into the saddle, you gotta stay there.

470
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,142
- Evidently, you overlooked that.
- I suppose you could do better.

471
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:25,342
Morgan: Well, i wouldn't say that.
I might try, though.

472
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,820
Especially if the stakes were right.

473
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:31,789
I wouldn't mind trying to ride anything
you've got for that bear creek range.

474
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:36,523
If you mean that, mr. Lane,
you might just wind up with a broken neck.

475
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:38,222
Morgan:
True enough.

476
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,493
On the other hand,
i might wind up with a range.

477
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:43,637
You wanna bet or don't you?

478
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:45,866
It's a deal.

479
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,504
Good.

480
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:52,145
What were you saying about texas?

481
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:55,411
Well, there's an awful lot of it.

482
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,053
- Morning, sheriff.
- Morning.

483
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:37,317
- Looks like the whole town's out here.
- Yeah. News sure travels fast, tecumseh.

484
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,792
- Who you betting on, the man or the horse?
- The horse. I know that animal.

485
00:34:41,963 --> 00:34:44,363
Any man stays on him,
i'll throw my badge away.

486
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:47,501
I got $ 1 0 that says
the stranger stays up on him.

487
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,726
I'll take that bet.

488
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,779
Step in close, everybody.
Papa schultz takes all the bets.

489
00:35:06,954 --> 00:35:09,514
One suit of clothes,
one pair of shoes, one hat...

490
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,786
...one suit of underwear against $ 1 5
that my partner stays on the horse.

491
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:16,395
- I'll take that bet, mister.
Papa: Thank you.

492
00:35:16,564 --> 00:35:20,159
- I'll take some of that.
- Thank you. Money. Thank you, thank you.

493
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:23,235
Now for the ladies.
One skillet, one washtub...

494
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:27,135
...one bottle of perfume against $ 1
my partner stays on the horse.

495
00:35:27,308 --> 00:35:29,742
- Here you are, mister.
- Sold for the lady. Thank you.

496
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:32,345
Step in close, everyone.

497
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,114
- Everything all ready, reeves?
- Yup, he's ready.

498
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:37,251
- Morning.
- Howdy, sheriff.

499
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:39,716
More ways than one
to get rid of a man, huh, rod?

500
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,948
Yes. Why don't you try it sometime?
All right, bring him out.

501
00:35:49,597 --> 00:35:51,258
[Horse neighing]

502
00:35:58,105 --> 00:35:59,766
You understand the rules, mr. Lane?

503
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:03,570
In order to win, you have to stay
in the saddle one full minute.

504
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:08,478
Well, look, i don't want to appear curious,
but how will i know when the time's up?

505
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:10,344
I'll blow this whistle.

506
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:11,542
Oh.

507
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:14,279
Well, don't be afraid to blow it real loud,
will you?

508
00:36:14,455 --> 00:36:16,616
[Chuckles]
I hope i'm around to hear it.

509
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:19,885
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

510
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:27,195
Mr. Tecumseh, what do you think?
Will my partner stay on this horse?

511
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:29,632
If he falls down, i am bankrupt.

512
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:32,034
- How much you got bet on him?
- Don't ask me.

513
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:35,232
Everything in the wagon.
Everything on my back.

514
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:36,501
Shoes too.

[Crowd cheering]

517
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:06,238
- Hang on, son. Hang on.
- Is he still on? Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

518
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:07,601
Stay on him, son.

519
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:19,246
Stay on him.

520
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:25,924
Come on, boy, ride him.

521
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,778
Partner, we are out of business.

522
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:53,581
Are you all right?
Morgan, are you all right?

523
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:55,722
Get him some water.

524
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,120
Now, don't move.

525
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:00,590
I had no intention of moving.

526
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:05,096
Come on, get up.

527
00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:17,476
We should've driven out in the buckboard
after the toss that bronco gave you.

528
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:20,045
Yeah. Ouch.

529
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:21,472
He's quite some animal.

530
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:25,210
- You're quite some horseman, for a peddler.
- Peddler?

531
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:28,312
What a lovely spot.

532
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:32,152
If that horse had known i was riding for this
as a prize, he wouldn't have been rough.

533
00:38:32,326 --> 00:38:34,385
Well, you only lost by a couple of seconds.

534
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,587
Yeah, but he didn't have his watch.

535
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:39,028
That will always be
the longest minute in my life.

536
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,328
- It's been an interesting life, hasn't it?
- Mine?

537
00:38:43,537 --> 00:38:45,596
You said you came from australia,
didn't you?

538
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:48,401
Yeah. Say, there's a lovely country.

539
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,511
I guess there isn't very much
that you haven't seen.

540
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,613
Oh, yes, there is, plenty.

541
00:38:53,781 --> 00:38:56,716
- You wanna hear about the things i have?
- Where would you begin?

542
00:38:56,884 --> 00:38:58,374
Well, let's see.

543
00:38:58,552 --> 00:39:00,645
<i>Uh...</i> a moon over the andes.

544
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:03,654
Oh, now, we have
pretty tolerable moons over montana.

545
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:04,916
Well, all right.

546
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,219
Let's say surf along a coral beach
in the tropics.

547
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:08,419
Oh, no.

548
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:12,088
Give me 1 0,000 head of cattle
at roundup time.

549
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,398
Tell me, morgan...

550
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:19,005
...why did you leave all these sights
and places to come to montana?

551
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:25,442
Well, i guess every man's got a sort of
special dream of his own.

552
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,171
What's yours?

553
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:29,043
Simple enough.

554
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:33,581
A sheltered valley, good green pasture.

555
00:39:33,754 --> 00:39:36,018
Hot in the summer, cold in winter.

556
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:38,884
A place to build a house.

557
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,550
A woman.

558
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,889
That's a good dream, morgan.

559
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:48,093
Do you, uh, think you could
make your dream come true in this valley?

560
00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:49,395
Oh, yes.

561
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,936
Better than any place i ever saw.

562
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:56,239
And to think i only lost it
by a few seconds.

563
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,900
No, you didn't.

564
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,910
This isn't bear creek.

565
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:02,413
This is sunset valley.

566
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,841
It belongs to me.

567
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:08,318
It isn't part
of the ackroyd-singleton range.

568
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,616
Runs clear down to those foothills.

569
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:15,891
My brother would've built his house here
if he'd lived.

570
00:40:17,631 --> 00:40:19,064
I'm gonna lease it to you.

571
00:40:21,235 --> 00:40:22,634
You're gonna?

572
00:40:23,537 --> 00:40:24,561
Why?

573
00:40:25,272 --> 00:40:27,172
Because i want you to have it.

574
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,969
Yes, but why?

575
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:35,309
Well, because i think you're the kind
of cattleman we're gonna need on our side.

576
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:38,452
This fight's gonna be tougher
than the last one.

577
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:45,019
Tell me, why do you have to fight?

578
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:48,320
Some idiot's bringing sheep
on the range again.

579
00:40:48,496 --> 00:40:50,521
Yeah, but it's only one man.

580
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:54,361
No, listen, when there's one man
low and greedy enough...

581
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:58,369
...to bring sheep onto country like this,
others will follow.

582
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,439
We found that out in the last sheep war.

583
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:02,576
You won the last one.

584
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,069
I lost my father and brother doing it.

585
00:41:06,247 --> 00:41:07,737
I see.

586
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:10,916
I guess this valley means a lot to you.

587
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,013
A part of you, huh?

588
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,581
Maybe that's why i want you to have it.

589
00:41:19,793 --> 00:41:21,420
Among other things.

590
00:41:23,697 --> 00:41:25,631
What other things?

591
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:27,232
<i>Well...</i>

592
00:41:28,802 --> 00:41:33,739
look, um, we'd better be getting into town
and drawing up that lease.

593
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,631
Looks like a sheepdog.

594
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,500
Smells like one too.

595
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:09,802
- He acts like he's looking for somebody.
- Yeah.

596
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,507
When he finds him,
we'll find us a sheepherder.

597
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:21,715
Well, this lease seems to make me
a montana landholder, at least temporarily.

598
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:23,322
That's right.

599
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:26,186
May i be the first to congratulate you...

600
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,252
...on the beginning of your dream?

601
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:29,828

Poor old girl.
What did you do, break your rope?

Mm-hm. She should, i raised her.

613
00:43:16,977 --> 00:43:18,069
That's a sheepdog.

614
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,043
Yeah. Good dogs.

615
00:43:23,217 --> 00:43:24,616
You ought to get yourself one.

616
00:43:24,785 --> 00:43:27,117
Sheepdogs mean sheepherders
in this country.

617
00:43:27,288 --> 00:43:29,188
I thought i recognized you before.
Now i'm sure.

618
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,755
That dog of yours cinched it.

619
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:35,624
Mister, you're a sheepherder.

620
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,061
You heard what he called you?

621
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:43,767
Uh-huh.

622
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:46,829
He's right. I'm a sheepman.

623
00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:54,671
Now get back to those filthy sheep of yours
and get them out of the country.

624
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:58,510
No, ma'am. I'm staying right here.

625
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,883
I'm gonna move my sheep
into the pasture i just leased.

626
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:05,321
Wait a minute, mister.
You tricked me out of that lease.

627
00:44:05,492 --> 00:44:08,655
There's no law in this territory
that will hold me to it.

628
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:10,797
Move your sheep
into that valley of mine...

629
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:15,367
...and every cattleman in the country will
ride against you with every gun they've got.

turned out to be a sheepherder, huh?

You read that warning sign, didn't you?

634

Yeah. Sure.

635
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:50,098
It said any sheepman
crossing the line gets shot on sight.

636
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,636
Well, why doesn't someone
start shooting?

637
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:55,998
We don't shoot unarmed men.

638
00:44:56,176 --> 00:44:57,473
Maybe you figured on that.

639
00:44:57,644 --> 00:44:58,702
You're a liar.

640
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:02,142
Your men shot down my sheepherder...

641
00:45:02,316 --> 00:45:04,648
...a young kid
who never carried a gun in his life.

642
00:45:04,818 --> 00:45:08,754
Yeah. Any other sheepherder who crosses
that line will get the same as he got.

643
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:10,219
He never crossed your deadline.

Reese:
No, but you did.

645
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:15,462
Listen, sheepherder.

646
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:20,289
Either you get out of town
or you'll get the same thing.

650

Drop that gun...

651
00:46:31,805 --> 00:46:34,296
...or i'll squeeze this iron
as sure as you're born.

652
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:37,603
You better get back to your sheep, mister,
while you're still alive.

653

[All laughing and jeering]

654
00:47:19,213 --> 00:47:21,477
Here's some hot milk, dear,
to quiet your nerves.

655
00:47:21,649 --> 00:47:23,913
Hot milk? I'm so mad i could drink hot...

656
00:47:24,085 --> 00:47:26,315
milk will do. I'll set it right here.

657
00:47:26,487 --> 00:47:27,511
A sheepman.

658
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:31,317
The lowest, vilest, most contemptible
creature on the face of the earth.

659
00:47:31,492 --> 00:47:34,461
If you could've seen him
standing there <i>smirking...</i>

660
00:47:34,629 --> 00:47:36,961
if i'd had a gun,
i'd have blown him in two.

661
00:47:37,131 --> 00:47:40,066
Next time you go out with him, dear,
be sure to carry your gun.

662
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:43,431
Next time? Next time i gotta get even.

663
00:47:43,604 --> 00:47:45,128
Oh, what a fool i was.

664
00:47:45,306 --> 00:47:48,503
Every girl is entitled
to make a fool of herself once.

665
00:47:48,676 --> 00:47:52,112
Yeah, but not with a sheepman.

666
00:47:58,119 --> 00:47:59,780
[Crashing]

667
00:48:06,961 --> 00:48:10,624
Well? If you can think of anything
more contemptible to say...

668
00:48:10,798 --> 00:48:14,256
...than i've already said to myself,
say it and get out.

669
00:48:14,836 --> 00:48:17,532
You must feel mighty proud
of the singleton name tonight.

670
00:48:17,705 --> 00:48:21,163
You've just handed the richest-watered
range land in the whole territory...

671
00:48:21,342 --> 00:48:23,537
...to a song-singing sheepman
in fancy clothes.

672
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:25,235
Well, what if i did?

673
00:48:25,413 --> 00:48:27,540
It's my land.
I can do what i want with it.

674
00:48:27,715 --> 00:48:29,808
You idiot.
You played right into lane's hands.

675
00:48:29,984 --> 00:48:33,044
With that lease, he can move in.
He's got the law on his side now.

676
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:36,384
Listen, if morgan lane
moves sheep on my land...

677
00:48:36,557 --> 00:48:39,082
...i'll personally shoot every one of them
and him too.

678
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,320
Oh, that's fine, brave talk
now that the damage has been done.

679
00:48:42,497 --> 00:48:45,159
Besides tossing away
everything our family's fought for...

680
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:48,791
...you've made a laughingstock out of me.
- You a laughingstock? Ha.

681
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:50,961
So that's what's hurting you, your pride.

682
00:48:51,138 --> 00:48:53,470
How do you think it looks
for the girl i'm to be marrying...?

683
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:56,269
If that's the way you feel,
you can call that off right now.

684
00:48:56,444 --> 00:48:57,468
Uh-uh.

685
00:48:57,645 --> 00:49:00,136
Right now,
i got more important things to do.

686
00:49:01,382 --> 00:49:03,111
Like what?

687
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:05,516
I'm gonna get that lease back.

688
00:49:05,686 --> 00:49:07,381
Wait a minute.

689
00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:11,456
I gave morgan lane that lease
and i'll get it back.

690
00:49:21,936 --> 00:49:25,201
There's no more than a trickle of water
in the creek, laddie.

691
00:49:25,373 --> 00:49:28,774
You got this lease from the girl
just in time.

692
00:49:30,678 --> 00:49:32,270
Yeah.

693
00:49:32,914 --> 00:49:35,348
Hated to get it that way, though, mac...

694
00:49:35,516 --> 00:49:36,744
...but it had to be.

695
00:49:36,918 --> 00:49:40,786
Well, what about the sheep, mr. Lane?
They've got to have water.

696
00:49:42,323 --> 00:49:44,450
We're driving them across tomorrow.

697
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:47,389
That means fighting and killing.

698
00:49:47,562 --> 00:49:49,154
Yeah.

699
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:51,321
Too bad she's gotta be mixed up in it.

700
00:49:52,266 --> 00:49:55,030
All's fair in love and war, mr. Lane.

701
00:49:56,437 --> 00:49:57,836
Who said anything about love?

702
00:49:58,005 --> 00:49:59,029
[Gunshot]

703
00:50:16,123 --> 00:50:18,318
Morgan:
Hello there, tecumseh.

704
00:50:18,926 --> 00:50:21,861
A fine greeting
for a friend who comes a-visiting.

705
00:50:22,029 --> 00:50:24,623
I'm sorry. Weren't expecting any friends.

706
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:27,063
Gave my boys orders
to shoot anybody on horseback.

707
00:50:27,234 --> 00:50:28,724
Next time, i'll walk in.

708
00:50:28,903 --> 00:50:30,632
Might be safer for you at that.

709
00:50:30,805 --> 00:50:33,569
Come on over and squat.
I'm glad you came out.

710
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:36,209
I wanted to thank you
for what you did for me in town.

711
00:50:36,377 --> 00:50:39,073
Shucks, weren't nothing i done.

712
00:50:40,715 --> 00:50:44,151
Well, if you really wanna thank me,
let me join up with you.

713
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:47,082
I figure it will be healthier for me
in the long run.

714
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:48,812
Join up?

715
00:50:49,457 --> 00:50:51,948
You've got something going on back here.
What is it?

716
00:50:52,126 --> 00:50:53,252
Well, here it is.

717
00:50:53,427 --> 00:50:55,952
The big cattle outfits run the country.

718
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,394
With their loud talk,
their riding and shooting...

719
00:50:58,566 --> 00:51:00,158
...and their hatred for sheepmen.

720
00:51:01,168 --> 00:51:03,898
- Tell me something i don't know.
- All right, i will.

721
00:51:04,305 --> 00:51:07,672
There's a lot of little cattlemen around here
what can't make a living...

722
00:51:08,142 --> 00:51:12,078
...because they're being pushed
and squeezed by the big outfits.

723
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:14,237
Do you know
many of those little cattlemen?

724
00:51:14,415 --> 00:51:16,042
I know every one of them.

725
00:51:16,717 --> 00:51:17,741
You do, eh?

726
00:51:20,588 --> 00:51:22,681
Morgan:
All right, let's get to the point.

727
00:51:22,857 --> 00:51:26,190
You small ranchers are getting
put out of business by the big outfits.

728
00:51:26,594 --> 00:51:28,755
There's no secret about that, is there?

729
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:30,897
You're fighting for your very existence.

730
00:51:31,065 --> 00:51:34,694
All right, the way i see it,
there's only one thing to be done.

731
00:51:34,869 --> 00:51:38,236
You've got to start running cattle
on the same range with sheep.

732
00:51:38,406 --> 00:51:39,532
It can't be done.

733
00:51:40,574 --> 00:51:42,132
You're wrong. It can be done.

734
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:46,075
Swing with me, i'll not only show you how,
but i'll give you the sheep to start with.

735
00:51:46,247 --> 00:51:47,771
Pedro:
People's coming.

736
00:51:47,948 --> 00:51:49,939
[Hoofbeats appro aching]

737
00:51:57,892 --> 00:51:58,916
Whoa.

738
00:51:59,093 --> 00:52:04,463
It took a bit of persuading, but i finally got
mr. Clark, the banker, to drive out with me.

739
00:52:04,632 --> 00:52:05,963
Morgan:
Good to see you, mr. Clark.

740
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:08,761
Hello, lane. Hello, joe, barry.

741
00:52:08,936 --> 00:52:10,301
What are you boys up to?

742
00:52:10,471 --> 00:52:14,339
I've just been trying to tell our neighbors
that they don't have to stay broke.

743
00:52:14,508 --> 00:52:16,032
Well, i'm certainly glad to hear that.

744
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:18,474
Lane wants us to go in with him
on his sheep deal.

745
00:52:18,646 --> 00:52:22,480
He's willing to cut us in on shares if we'll
back him up when he crosses the deadline.

746
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,880
That sounds good
from a financial standpoint.

747
00:52:25,052 --> 00:52:26,417
And i know you can use the money.

748
00:52:26,587 --> 00:52:28,350
But these people are all friends of mine.

749
00:52:28,522 --> 00:52:30,683
You're asking them
to start a fight they can't win.

750
00:52:30,858 --> 00:52:35,056
Wait a minute, mr. Clark.
I'm not asking them to start anything alone.

751
00:52:35,229 --> 00:52:38,494
But if i can guarantee that one
of the big outfits will swing along with us...

752
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:40,600
...would you advise us to take a chance?

753
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:42,326
You don't mean forsythe?

754
00:52:43,471 --> 00:52:45,871
- Who else?
- Splendid.

755
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,941
Well. If forsythe's in,
i'm all for the deal.

756
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:51,635
Count me in too. I like it.

757
00:52:51,812 --> 00:52:53,973
Boys, it's a deal.
I'll tell you when we move.

758
00:52:54,148 --> 00:52:55,809
I want to thank you for riding out here.

759
00:52:55,983 --> 00:52:58,178
- We'll be waiting.
- Good night.

760
00:52:58,352 --> 00:52:59,546
How about a cup of coffee?

761
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,915
Thanks, i will.

762
00:53:08,362 --> 00:53:10,796
With forsythe on our side,
i don't see how we can lose.

763
00:53:10,965 --> 00:53:13,160
- When did you see forsythe?
- I didn't.

764
00:53:13,334 --> 00:53:14,665
You don't know him?

765
00:53:15,336 --> 00:53:16,667
Uh-uh.

766
00:53:16,837 --> 00:53:19,032
Then how do you expect
to sell this deal to him?

767
00:53:19,206 --> 00:53:20,230
I don't know.

768
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:22,068
[Chuckles]

769
00:53:22,243 --> 00:53:25,644
First, you tell the little fellows
you've got forsythe on your side.

770
00:53:25,813 --> 00:53:29,340
Now you're going to tell forsythe
you've got the little fellows lined up.

771
00:53:29,517 --> 00:53:32,247
Lane, you ought to be a politician.

772
00:53:34,221 --> 00:53:37,657
Say, do you think it would be too late
to see forsythe tonight?

773
00:53:37,825 --> 00:53:38,985
Too late tonight?

774
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,991
Sure. You're gonna introduce me to him.

775
00:53:41,862 --> 00:53:43,329
Good health.

776
00:53:48,235 --> 00:53:50,567
Man:
All you gentlemen say is quite true.

777
00:53:51,005 --> 00:53:54,907
Everything you've told me is confirmed here
in my company's quarterly statement.

778
00:53:55,709 --> 00:54:00,510
We're facing an alarming situation
if the price of beef continues to decline.

779
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:04,616
Mr. Lane, i see your point.

780
00:54:04,785 --> 00:54:07,845
With sheep, we'd have two markets,
wool and mutton.

781
00:54:08,022 --> 00:54:10,320
The price of both is up.

782
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:13,349
Maybe you're right.

783
00:54:13,894 --> 00:54:16,294
There's just one hitch.

784
00:54:16,463 --> 00:54:18,954
You're asking me
to turn against my neighbors...

785
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:22,193
...to make enemies of men
who've been my friends for years.

786
00:54:22,369 --> 00:54:25,270
Look, mr. Forsythe,
here it is in a nutshell.

787
00:54:25,439 --> 00:54:28,306
If you can convince your friends
of your faith in this plan...

788
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:30,340
...you'll be accomplishing two things:

789
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:32,479
You'll bring prosperity back to the range...

790
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:35,274
...and you'll put an end
to all of this fighting and shooting...

791
00:54:35,449 --> 00:54:38,043
...that's been going on around here
for years.

792
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:40,880
It might work, gentlemen.

793
00:54:41,055 --> 00:54:42,420
It might work.

794
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:43,614
It will work.

795
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:46,521
Just get them together
and give it to them straight.

796
00:54:56,437 --> 00:55:00,100
And i want every wagon road and trail
that crosses our property closed.

797
00:55:00,274 --> 00:55:03,539
Cut some cedar posts and string new wire.
Have the men ride the line...

798
00:55:03,711 --> 00:55:06,771
...and check every foot of fence
between here and blackstone canyon.

799
00:55:06,947 --> 00:55:10,405
Reeves, i'm holding you responsible
for anything that gets through.

800
00:55:10,584 --> 00:55:13,553
Yes, ma'am. All right, boys, let's go.

801
00:55:18,158 --> 00:55:20,319
- Good morning, maria.
- Good morning, maria.

802
00:55:20,494 --> 00:55:23,657
Maria: Morning.
- Things seem to be popping this morning.

803
00:55:23,831 --> 00:55:26,129
Maria:
They've just begun to pop, mr. Clark.

804
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,427
Say, what are you two doing
in my neighborhood?

805
00:55:28,602 --> 00:55:32,299
Well, george here insisted on driving over
to personally invite you and rod...

806
00:55:32,473 --> 00:55:34,407
...to a little gathering
at his house tonight.

807
00:55:34,575 --> 00:55:38,568
Well, i can't speak for rod,
but i'm in no mood for social affairs.

808
00:55:38,746 --> 00:55:40,646
It won't be altogether social, maria.

809
00:55:40,814 --> 00:55:42,441
There will be business discussed...

810
00:55:42,616 --> 00:55:45,141
...that concerns you
and every rancher in this section.

811
00:55:45,319 --> 00:55:47,651
- You make it sound mighty important.
- It could be, maria.

812
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:48,845
Maria:
What's it all about?

813
00:55:49,023 --> 00:55:51,617
I can't very well tell you that
until we all get together.

814
00:55:51,792 --> 00:55:54,727
But it will be a sort of surprise.

815
00:55:54,895 --> 00:55:57,193
Well, i've had enough surprises lately.

816
00:55:57,364 --> 00:55:59,332
Thanks for the invitation.
Maybe next time.

817
00:56:04,138 --> 00:56:05,833
Maria:
Wait a minute.

818
00:56:06,573 --> 00:56:09,064
- I'll come to your party on one condition.
- Name it.

819
00:56:09,944 --> 00:56:11,707
Invite morgan lane.

820
00:56:13,514 --> 00:56:15,311
Morgan lane will be there, i promise.

821
00:56:25,793 --> 00:56:29,388
I'd like to know what's behind
forsythe's idea in giving this shindig.

822
00:56:29,563 --> 00:56:31,053
Said he had a surprise for everybody.

823
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:33,461
Why don't you go in and find out?
You got an invite.

824
00:56:33,634 --> 00:56:36,432
Uh-uh. I got more important business
in town.

825
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:38,798
You got more chance
of getting shot in town too.

826
00:56:38,973 --> 00:56:41,669
If that's your idea of humor,
