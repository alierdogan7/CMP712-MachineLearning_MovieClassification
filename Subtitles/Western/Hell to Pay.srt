[Soft folk music]

00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:27,549
# #

3
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,768
Wonderin' if you folks
might let me climb aboard.

4
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,065
Uh-uh.

5
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,131
I don't take no blue bellies
on board, mister.

6
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,904
War's over, driver.

7
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,104
I'm willin' to pay.
Yellowbacks.

8
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,410
Yankees killed both my brothers
at First Manassas.

9
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,040
I'll tell you somethin',

10
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,244
there ain't enough money
in the state of Colorado

11
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,288
to buy passage on this rig.

12
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:46,257
What's the problem, Johnny?

13
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,918
Well, there ain't
no problem, Chance.

14
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,462
It's just that, seems
one of Mr. Lincoln's boys

15
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,498
has lost his way,
that's all.

16
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,725
Sorrell came up lame.

17
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,734
I was hopin' I might be able
to climb aboard

18
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,326
and get a lift
to the next town.

19
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,372
Don't see any harm in lettin'
this poor sod aboard, Johnny.

20
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,704
Chance!
You of all people.

21
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,470
It's like he said.

22
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,136
War's over.

23
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,861
Lieutenant Kirby Scott,
ma'am.

24
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,032
Rebekah Shepard.

25
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,076
This is my father
Jedediah.

26
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,872
After my momma died, my father
and I elected to come west.

27
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,378
We're joining my sister.

28
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,880
She's already got a business
established in Rampart.

29
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,041
(Jedediah)
How about you, son?

30
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,414
Mustered out
of Fort McHenry, sir.

31
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,474
Week after Appomattox.

32
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,644
That didn't
take you long.

33
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,085
Homestead Act, sir.

34
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,986
Figured I better get out here
and get some land

35
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,457
before the rest of Mr. Lincoln's
army beats me to it.

36
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,461
Ah, well, if it's land you're
looking for, you're in luck.

37
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,053
My father's a new land agent.

38
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,622
Jedediah Shepard
at your service.

39
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,395
So you're gonna be
a Sodbuster.

40
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,629
Something against
honest work?

41
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,639
Just sounds like, uh...
work.

42
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,969
And you?

43
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,443
Gambling? Robbery?
Shiftless lay about?

44
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,707
(Rebekah)
Lieutenant! I hardly think
that's appropriate.

45
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,373
Were it not for this man,

46
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,885
you'd hardly be aboard
this conveyance.

47
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:38,338
Whoa now! Whoa!
Ho!

48
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,269
Anybody goes for a gun
and I'll break her neck.

49
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,241
That includes you, Banker!

50
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,503
Go on.
Hand 'em over, boys.

51
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,010
Be quick about it.

52
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,412
All of you.
Out with your hands high.

53
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,780
You leave these passengers
alone, mister.

54
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,614
Do you want to join
your brother, Johnny?

55
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,517
Come on! Come on!

56
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,120
Well, look what we got here.

57
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,095
A real blue belly.

58
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,597
Let's get a rope
and string him up right now.

59
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,826
Don't get itchy, boys,

60
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,300
and you won't get hurt.

61
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,632
Lemme see that piece.

62
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,804
Well, will you look
at this.

63
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,537
What are you,
some kind of fancy gun thrower?

64
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,171
Actually,
I'm an ornithologist.

65
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,545
Ooh! I'd be horny too,

66
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,584
ridin' next to this
sweet little thing.

67
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,482
I think she oughta
come back with us.

68
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,986
Keepin' me mighty warm
at night.

69
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,047
Step back or I'll give you
the bellyful of lead

70
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,685
I should've given
you at Shiloh.

71
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,955
Quiet!

72
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,690
Now let's get
what we came here for, boys.

73
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,824
Law's gonna catch up
to you one day, partner.

74
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,927
Well, I am just quaking
in my boots, Johnny.

75
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,272
It's locked, boss.

76
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,106
Turn the box around.

77
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,379
Anybody else?

78
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,750
There's a fortune
in here, boss.

79
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,089
It's about time.

80
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,891
That's government money.
You'll never get away... Eh!

81
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,931
No!

82
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,365
Maybe that'll teach you some
respect, Mr. Government agent.

83
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,902
Stop it, please.
Just stop it.

84
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,197
Leave him alone.

85
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,262
Just take the money
and leave us alone.

86
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,398
Take what you came for
and get out.

87
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,739
Grab the strongbox
and the mail.

88
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,478
Bring it to my horse.

89
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,890
Now don't go spendin'
all that

90
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,516
before we get back to town.

91
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:41,855
You know what to do.

92
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,225
You haven't got
a problem with that,

93
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,264
now do you, Lassiter?

94
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,266
(Rebekah)
You can't do this.

95
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,565
It's cold-blooded murder.

96
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,367
Maybe we can make an exception
in your case, honey.

97
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,907
[Laughter]

98
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,602
Sha!

99
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,544
Come on, come on.

100
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,608
It'll be first light
in less than an hour.

101
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,247
Gut shoot him and let's get
this thing over with.

102
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,223
Lieutenant!

103
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,700
Let's get out of here.

104
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,309
Johnny!
Let's get him in the coach.

105
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,508
Are you all right, sir?

106
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,880
I think so.

107
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,476
Lieutenant!
We need a hand here.

108
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,357
Be careful.
He's hurt pretty bad.

109
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,094
I've never seen
anything like this.

110
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,366
The two of you,

111
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,965
you almost seemed
like you were one person.

112
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,008
We should.

113
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,414
I don't understand.

114
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,351
He's my brother.

115
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,261
Whoa now! Whoa! Whoa!

116
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,595
JT!
Sheriff!

117
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,568
What's the ruckus, Johnny?

118
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,002
Find Doc Gaylen. We got
a wounded man in the coach.

119
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,039
Get away clean?

120
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,095
Whoa, boy.

121
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,232
Same outfit as last time.

122
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,709
You know, the hoods,
the whole works.

123
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,405
Howie, you round up
Doc Gaylen.

124
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,844
Matt, you and Mordechai
get him

125
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,541
up to Mother Smalley's.

126
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,083
Daddy, he's hurt.

127
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,140
Legs, legs.

128
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,185
Grab his legs.

129
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,312
Shhhew!

130
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,583
These two here gunned
half a dozen of 'em.

131
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,715
And if the leader
hadn't have grabbed

132
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,692
the box aforehand
and rushed off with it,

133
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,125
they'd have got him to.

134
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,457
You know how
teary-eyed I get

135
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,827
around these things,
big brother.

136
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,229
Why don't you, uh,

137
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,096
handle the formalities
with the Sheriff here,

138
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,362
and I'll, um,

139
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,461
be in my office.

140
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,630
Miss Rebekah?

141
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:07,934
My brother here?

142
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,941
He loves paperwork.

143
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,316
Appears like you
and your brother

144
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,862
happened along
in the nick of time.

145
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,558
That's just what anybody
would've done, sir.

146
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,500
I can assure you that ain't
the case, young fella.

147
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,663
Seeing as how there have been
six payroll robberies

148
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,900
in six weeks,
and nobody yet done nothin',

149
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,373
including me.

150
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,670
Your name?

151
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,541
Lieutenant Kirby Scott.

152
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,637
Or make that just Kirby Scott.

153
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,410
You wouldn't by any thought
be the Kirby Scott

154
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,885
from Little Roundtop,
Antietam,

155
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,148
Bull Run?

156
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,019
Yes, I've been
to those places, sir.

157
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,887
Been to those places?

158
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,587
Son, if you're the same
Kirby Scott I'm talkin' about,

159
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,789
we heard of you
even way out here

160
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,593
in this little one mule town.

161
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,998
No wonder Johnny there
thinks you're aces,

162
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,933
and he rode with Jeb Stewart.

163
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,028
There's a lot of heroes
in the war, Sheriff.

164
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,596
If you don't mind, I'd
just as soon not jaw about it.

165
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,269
Mindin' my own business don't
precisely come with this job,

166
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,606
if you know what I mean.

167
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,408
No offense.

168
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,471
I often wonder if folks
keep electin' me

169
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,016
because I'm naturally nosy,

170
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,449
or just not bein'

171
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,816
the swiftest bull
in the herd

172
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,946
don't qualify me
for much else.

173
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,047
Man needs to know
his limitations.

174
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,651
And able companions
they have become.

175
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,128
If these little facts
you'll swear to, if need be,

176
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:44,033
just put your John Henry
on that last line there.

177
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,071
What are your plans, son?

178
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:50,472
Don't suppose you'd consider
postin' here as my deputy?

179
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,783
That's a kind offer, sir,
but no.

180
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,980
It's a lousy offer.

181
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,114
And I don't blame you
one whip.

182
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,558
This town's been mouse quiet
since the mine shut down.

183
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,720
But with the war over,
folks are gonna come west

184
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,663
faster than goose grease
through a tin horn.

185
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,066
Neither me nor Marshall Boone
are gettin' any younger.

186
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,366
There's plenty of able-bodied
folk around.

187
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,497
Able-bodied ain't
what's in short supply.

188
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,303
Good luck, son.

189
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:23,743
[Piano playing She'll Be Comin'
Around the Mountain]

190
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,303
[Piano playing She'll Be Comin'

191

# #

192
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:36,176
Bartender, you got any of that
Tennessee sippin' whiskey?

193
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,587
These boys drink
elephant piss.

194
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,921
Think they've gone
to hell.

195
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,724
Put away your money,
stranger.

196
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:48,096
First drink in town
always on Del Shannon.

197
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,362
Might that be the same
as on the house?

198
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,630
Might be.

199
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,299
Damn you,
you two-timin' sidewinder.

200
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,705
(Del)
Hold it there, partner.

201
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,539
Do I know you?

202
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,011
You sure as hell
gonna remember me.

203
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,049
Hey, bartender, you move
any closer to that shotgun,

204
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,607
and I'll gut shoot him
right now.

205
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,677
Now, mister, I don't know
what got under your scent,

206
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,950
but if you will sit
for a spell

207
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,321
and have a drink...

208
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,555
Ha! I ain't drinkin'
with no rattlesnake like you.

209
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,392
Well, well, well,
Horace.

210
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,455
Is that you?

211
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,966
There's the one
that done it.

212
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,434
You... You tell him
to stay back, Shannon.

213
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,698
This bushwhacker
jumped my claim.

214
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,637
On your orders.
And I can prove it.

215
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,641
Least-wise I could, but...

216
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,475
(Del)
Now, mister,
those are mighty strong words.

217
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,139
Maybe if you'll just
sit a spell,

218
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,410
we can work this out.

219
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,718
Or you can just say
adios, Horace.

220
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,312
Ah! Unh!

221
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,915
D-Did I do that?
I am so sorry.

222
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:51,395
I just got this thing, and have
no idea what to do with it.

223
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,667
My apologies again.

224
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,938
Shake the man's hand.

225
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,353
Arly Lyons.

226
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,651
Pleasure, I'm sure.

227
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,332
I-I don't know
who are, mister,

228
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,598
but thank you kindly.

229
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,507
I don't know whether to shake
your hand or shoot you.

230
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:50,647
That old fool might come back
someday and bushwhack me.

231
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,420
Got a feelin' you'll be
seein' him first.

232
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,432
Excuse me.

233
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,163
Dad, look at that.

234
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,431
It'll be fine.

235
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,303
Well, you'd be
Jedediah Shepard.

236
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,433
I'm Matt Elden.

237
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,067
Matt Elden, I'd like to
introduce you

238
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,634
to my daughter Rebekah.

239
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,044
Well, it's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, ma'am.

240
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:20,074
I'm afraid that
your desk is rather...

241
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:25,317
Ellis Potter must not be
as neat as I remembered.

242
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,918
Sir, Ellis Potter
was murdered six weeks ago.

243
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,689
L... I assumed you knew.

244
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,787
Murdered?

245
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,855
I thought Ellis Potter
was retiring.

246
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,458
I knew him back in Virginia.

247
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,333
Well, he was to retire
this week,

248
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,340
but I'm afraid
he didn't make it.

249
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,740
Jedediah! Is that you?

250
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,868
Mrs. Potter!

251
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,105
Rebekah Shepard!

252
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,737
Oh, darling!

253
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,282
My, how you have grown!

254
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,443
Mary, I just found out
about Ellis.

255
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,510
I'm so sorry.

256
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,555
Oh, thanks, Jed.

257
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,318
It was bad business.

258
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,018
Not that there's any chance

259
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,618
of corrallin' the varmints
that did it!

260
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,926
Now, Mary, you know
that is not fair!

261
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,091
This town
has its hands full.

262
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,601
Oh, it has its hands full,
sure.

263
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,604
Just not ladylike
to speculate what!

264
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,436
(Jedediah)
Kirby Scott. Just the man.

265
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,941
Matt Elden,
Kirby Scott.

266
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,910
Looks like he may be
our first customer.

267
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,105
I'm afraid Union Army

268
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,082
is not too popular
in these parts, Mr. Scott.

269
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,378
Well, I best rustle up

270
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,750
some new duds
before I'm shot, huh?

271
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,948
Mary, can I arrange
for you to get a ride home?

272
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,049
It's not too safe for a woman
traveling alone these days.

273
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,787
Oh, Dad,
I can go with her.

274
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,692
That way I'll be able
to see the countryside.

275
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,561
I-I'm afraid you don't
understand what I meant.

276
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,361
I'll see to it
you get home, ma'am.

277
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,925
And I will make sure that Miss
Shepard returns safely as well.

278
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,437
Fine idea.

279
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,803
That'll give me a chance
to track down Rachel

280
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,398
and rustle up some land
to show you.

281
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,467
Does that sit well
with you, Mary?

282
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,806
Right down
to the ground, Jed.

283
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,440
Mr. Scott,
come help me find my buggy.

284
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,519
Why, Miss Rebekah.

285
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,023
I was just comin'
to visit with you.

286
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,524
Oh, were you now?

287
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,891
Well, I was just wondering
if I could have the pleasure

288
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,556
of your company
at supper this evening.

289
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,896
Well, I'm afraid
your brother invited me

290
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,493
to accompany him
out to Miss Potter's.

291
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,128
I mean,
I'll be back in time.

292
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,470
I'll wait up, even if
it's way past my bedtime.

293
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,010
Whoa!

294
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,774
Well, hello, little brother.
You lost already?

295
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,815
I'm found, big brother.

296
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,681
I am found.

297
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,387
(Mrs. Potter)
So there's another Mr. Scott.

298
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,652
Better and better.

299
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,886
Don't worry, young man.

300
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,727
You'll have her all to yourself
on the way back.

301
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,788
Tashi'ne.

302
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:48,958
Lives with her older sister

303
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,262
in a played out mine
near the lake.

304
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,302
Just the two of them?

305
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,133
Three.

306
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,433
Her older sister married
Willie Brax

307
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,996
when he mustered out
of the Third Colorado

308
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,167
after Sand Creek.

309
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,334
Bad business.

310
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,707
Lot of folks say
he deserted.

311
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,245
But I know better.

312
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:05,079
Not a yellow bone
in his body.

313
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,011
Rebekah told me

314
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,386
that you and your brother
came out here together.

315
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,517
Was he in Mr. Lincoln's
army as well?

316
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,687
Uh, we didn't exactly
come out together, Miss Potter.

317
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,960
And, no, he didn't exactly
join the regular army.

318
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,433
Surely he didn't join
John Brown's men

319
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,595
or Quantrell's?

320
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:26,695
No, ma'am.

321
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,433
Uh, Chance sort of
sat on the sidelines,

322
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,633
if you know what I mean.

323
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,643
It was a hard war
to choose sides.

324
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,372
Didn't you have
a brother in the war?

325
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,073
Well, my brother Roy.

326
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,638
Evil bastard.

327
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,843
Pardon my language.

328
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,409
Rode with
"Bloody" Bill Anderson.

329
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,786
Left his granddaughter

330
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,348
for me to raise.

331
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,293
I dread the day
when he comes back.

332
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,330
What became
of your husband Ellis?

333
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:55,298
Ellis was a mining man
all his life...

334
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,664
from Pennsylvania.

335
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,397
Me being from Virginia, well,

336
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,099
we couldn't agree about nothin'
when the war came.

337
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,541
He put a lot of store
in Mr. Lincoln.

338
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,340
And most of the folks I knew

339
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,505
thought Abe was as dumb
as a post.

340
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:13,039
God rest his soul.

341
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,746
And when we came west,
Ellis ran the assay office

342
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,721
when the mines were open.

343
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,155
After the Homestead Act in '63,

344
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,692
it was just natural for him

345
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,625
to move on over
to the land office.

346
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,027
They couldn't get
a single man

347
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,124
from back east
'cause of the war.

348
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:33,194
[Sighs]
The last few months, though,

349
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,500
Ellis was actin'
very strange.

350
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,973
Excited and afraid.

351
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,068
My husband was not
a brave man, Kirby.

352
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,010
But he was honest.

353
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,173
Are you sayin'
my father's in danger?

354
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,774
I'd sure as hell say it.

355
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,218
(Mrs. Potter)
Shoot!

356
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,119
Sarah!

357
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,124
You'll say nothin'
of the sort!

358
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,320
L... This is my daughter, Sarah.

359
00:19:56,395 --> 00:20:00,331
Quite an alarmist,
as you can see.

360
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,367
Sarah. My name's Kirby Scott.

361
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,096
This is Miss Shepard.

362
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,104
Please to make
your acquaintance.

363
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,003
And this is Roy's
granddaughter Kathleen.

364
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,510
Say hi, baby.

365
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,807
Kathleen.

366
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,542
Perhaps we should be going.

367
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:18,548
Oh, no, please.

368
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,847
Won't you stay
for dinner, please?

369
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,216
Please.

370
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,653
Well, we have
so few folks here,

371
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,917
and we have plenty of food.

372
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:26,923
Not today, Mrs. Potter.

373
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,516
But I'd like very much
to visit you

374
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,925
later this week,
if you'll allow me.

375
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,362
Well, that just sounds grand.

376
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,990
I'm gonna hold you to it.

377
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,797
You can bank on it.

378
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,962
Don't look so worried,
Miss.

379
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,472
You heard that girl.
How can I not?

380
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,975
You know how excitable
women can be.

381
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,204
So you're an expert
on women, are you?

382
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,543
Oh, no. That's more
my brother's department.

383
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,742
Wait till he meets
my sister.

384
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,443
You must be Jedediah Shepard.

385
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:30,818
I am.

386
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,880
Excuse all the noise
around here,

387
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,325
but I'm having the place
spruced up a mite

388
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,453
on account
of the big onslaught.

389
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,587
Onslaught?

390
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,427
War's over, man.

391
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:41,693
Last coupla years,

392
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,997
you coulda fired Jeb Stewart's
cannon through town

393
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,128
and hit nothin' but birds.

394
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,672
Next coupla weeks,

395
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,173
half the town's population
is comin' back.

396
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,675
I suppose you're correct.

397
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,973
Suppose?

398
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,843
Your land office
and my saloon

399
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,611
will be the two top businesses
within 50 miles.

400
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,552
So put a smile
on that face of yours.

401
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,248
I'm lookin'
for a young woman.

402
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,086
Of course you are.

403
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,092
Forgive my poor manners.
Amanda!

404
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,129
We got ourselves here
a young fella

405
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,960
rode darn near 1,500 miles,

406
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,329
and we ain't yet offered him

407
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,301
a fine drink
or a nasty woman.

408
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,770
Right here,
Mr. Land Agent.

409
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,364
(Del)
Clint, my best bottle

410
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,842
for the land agent here.

411
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,879
Right here we have
our very, very best.

412
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:31,313
Excuse me, boys.
[Laughs]

413
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,180
Dad.

414
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,618
Dad!
[Crying]

415
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,091
Dad!

416
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,991
Dad...

417
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,223
Dad!

418
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:50,234
Don't get near me.

419
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,600
Dad...

420
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,402
Rachel.
Why are you dressed like that?

421
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,876
Let's not get into this,
Rebekah.

422
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,640
[Crying]

423
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,180
Shut up!

424
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:07,412
[Men laughing]

425
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,512
Where's that Virginia charm,
carpetbagger?

426
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,851
Come on, Chance.

427
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,187
Show us that legendary
American know-how.

428
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,126
[Laughs]

429
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:23,027
[Laughter]

430
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,865
You know, you could
just pay for it.

431
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:29,566
Afraid I'd quickly
become a poor man.

432
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,871
Told you things
would get exciting.

433
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,173
I don't think the law would
help on either side. Do you?

434
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,113
Job's still yours
if you want it.

435
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,412
A wise man knows
when to mind his own business.

436
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,076
We'll see.

437
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,947
Thank you for meeting me
this evening.

438
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,685
It was a very kind offer.

439
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,226
I've been called a lot
of things, ma'am,

440
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,386
but kind ain't one of 'em.

441
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,362
Well, you are.

442
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,796
Here's to kindness.

443
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:57,665
And to kind women.

444
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,704
Like my sister.

445
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,207
My pa didn't approve
of my life either, Rebekah.

446
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,608
Said I was too wild.

447
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:07,975
Too foolish.

448
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,742
Didn't care about
the important things.

449
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,080
Mucking stalls
and slapping hogs?

450
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:17,713
[Laughs]
And duty, honor, country.

451
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,381
Well, your father may not
have approved of you

452
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,824
not joining the army,
but I do.

453
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,760
War's foolishness.
What does it prove?

454
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,855
A man's worth, maybe?

455
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,593
Poppycock.

456
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,396
This war was an excuse
for Mr. Abraham Lincoln

457
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,632
and his Yankee profiteering
friends, who were trying to...

458
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,605
To free the slaves?

459
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,044
You and Father.

460
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,079
You think Rachel was furious

461
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,638
when her husband Ben
went back to fight?

462
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,946
I imagine so.

463
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,885
Furious women
do foolish things.

464
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,024
Well, you should take this wine
from me, Mr. Gambler.

465
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,427
I'm about to make
some foolish choices of my own.

466
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,378
Cabin should be
just over there.

467
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,176
This grassland
would be yours too.

468
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,412
Right up to that hillside.

469
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,851
Kinda fills the eye,
don't it?

470
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,321
Great place
to raise a family.

471
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,290
If a fella was so inclined.

472
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,350
If a fella was so inclined.

473
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,844
Sorry, son.
It looks worse than I had hoped.

474
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,559
Might be better off

475
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:13,502
to tear it down
and start over again.

476
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,006
It's not so bad,
Mr. Shepard.

477
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,066
Looks solid enough to me.

478
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,341
Mighty pretty at sunset.

479
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,440
My daughter's taken
quite a shine to you, son.

480
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,246
I suppose you know that.

481
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,082
I don't know
about that, sir.

482
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,849
I kinda figure she liked
my brother better,

483
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,412
if you want to know
the truth.

484
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,582
Fella like Chance

485
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,990
looks might enticing
to a girl at first.

486
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,427
But a man like you,
and a place like this,

487
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,487
looks better to me.

488
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,226
Ain't you maybe gettin'
the plough

489
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,733
a bit ahead of the mule, sir?

490
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,531
I know my daughter,
son.

491
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,730
And I know men.

492
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,602
You want this place,
it's yours.

493
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,937
But if you want my daughter,

494
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,874
you're gonna have to
go after her.

495
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,152
Mr. Elden thought
you wanted to see me.

496
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,095
He was mistaken.

497
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,757
Rebekah, I'm your sister.

498
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,131
Ah.

499
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,762
I'm sorry I wasn't there
after Mom passed, Bekie.

500
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:20,862
I was...

501
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,065
Otherwise engaged?

502
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,506
Look, I know you don't
approve of me.

503
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,100
But you weren't here

504
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,974
after Ben died.

505
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,741
I had no other way.

506
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,577
No easier way.

507
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,208
Please don't judge me, Bek.

508
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:36,082
Can't we just go back to...

509
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,418
We can't go back,
Rachel!

510
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,981
Today and tomorrow
is all we have.

511
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,583
But the War...

512
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,561
Is over! It's over!

513
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,063
People keep blaming the war,
and I am sick of it.

514
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,123
We can't walk away
from what it's done to us,

515
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,360
between us!

516
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,494
You can walk away
from what you're doin'.

517
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,594
[Laughs]

518
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,969
You could come work here.

519
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,507
Here?

520
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,064
You gotta be kiddin', honey.

521
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,269
I could never work here.

522
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,811
Never.

523
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,406
Never.

524
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,793
Didn't bury the hatchet,
I see.

525
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,324
Can't you see it stickin'
in my back?

526
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,031
Rebekah, this was

527
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:31,564
a very tough town
to live in during the war.

528
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,812
You think livin'
in Virginia was easy?

529
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,814
Half the families
for Lincoln.

530
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,406
The other half
were for Lee.

531
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,146
Our house was taken over
three times

532
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,312
as battle headquarters.

533
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,446
Once for the North,

534
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,012
twice for the South.

535
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,252
We lost everything.

536
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,619
Everything.

537
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,461
I'm sorry.
Hm?

538
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,864
Let it out.

539
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,635
I promised myself
I wouldn't do that.

540
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,640
That's a tough promise
to keep.

541
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:07,200
You said
this was a tough town.

542
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,620
So have you worked
for the bank long?

543
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,851
Not too long.

544
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,984
Used to have a ranch
just west of town.

545
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,030
Beef contracts
with the Union Army.

546
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,066
Easy work when the Army
was just fighting the Indians.

547
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:32,467
Not too popular when we
started fighting each other.

548
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:35,165
Lots of Confederate
sympathizers hereabouts,

549
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,673
as you can imagine.

550
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,972
Silver strike drew folks
from all over the South.

551
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,842
Owning a bank, you didn't
have to choose sides.

552
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,245
No.

553
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:47,307
Just have to lend money.

554
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,650
That's popular with everybody.

are you doin' here?

I worked with mongrels

The smell of you
makes me sick.

571
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,902
Get a poultice on that.

572
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,907
Otherwise,
she'll lose her foot.

573
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,842
Best not let us
see you again.

Time shall tell.

578
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,348
You're not gonna offer me
a glass of lemonade?

579
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,884
You pass by
any lemon trees?

580
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,385
No.

581
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,886
But if a man expects visitors,

582
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,321
he ought to be prepared.

583
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,019
Canteen's on the post.

584
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:46,188
Chance says you plan to stay
on this land to prove up.

585
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,027
What's it look like?

586
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,829
You could be goin' door-to-door

Why, Kirby.

591
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,271
You're not jealous?

Mr. Shannon and I heard
an ugly rumor.

607

Sheriff offered you
that deputy job.

608
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,021
And the more we thought
about it...

609
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,922
The more we realized

610
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:52,121
that I was much better qualified
for the job.

611
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,356

00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,695

I'm a farmer, McSween.

My father
was a farmer.

does him a good turn.

when they don't.

maybe to...

I expect to work
very hard at it.

I did not come
to pick up a gun.

some practice with that axe

really upset

00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:13,312
Shannon's men always tryin'
to run him off.

714
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,516
I'll be careful.

715
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,151
You sure there's nothing
I can do?

716
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,491
There's not much
any of us can do.

Kathleen's his
granddaughter.

It was only a matter of time
before he came back for her.

My uncle Roy is an evil man,
Mr. Scott.

I don't mind sayin' so.

721
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,870
And there's just only so much
evil in this world

723

Where's the bartender?

724
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,687
He got in Chickamauga, Reb.

725
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:03,393
We want whiskey. And none
of that chilipicker stuff.

It's the last of it.
Right here.

We're willin' to pay.

00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:49,838
I told you I didn't want
to see you again.

731
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,940
I have laudanum and medicine.

732
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,814
Otherwise, she'll lose
that foot.

733
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,299
I brought you
some medicine.

734
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,425
It might hurt a bit.

Brax!

I have a warrant
for you to vacate the premises.

00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,762
Effective noon tomorrow.

743
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,820
What warrant?

744
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,763
This is hogwash.

745
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,032
It's the law, old timer.

746
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:52,405
You abandoned this claim
when you joined the army.

747
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,341
I was servin' my country.

748
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,708
Well, you shoulda
thought of that

749
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:59,681
before you became
so patriotic.

750
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,048
Now, do you obey the law...

751
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,746
or do we end this
right here?

752
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,812
Mr. Brax needs time
to think it over.

753
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,983
If I was you,
I'd do the same.

754
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,958
Well, hello, Sodbuster.

755
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,495

your chance.

Nothing's changed.

I don't owe you nothin'.

761
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,455
Didn't ask for nothin'.

762
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:44,323
I wore the same uniform as you
for half a decade.

763
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,522
And I wore it with pride.

'Fore sun up on the 29th,

we reached the edge of camp,

full of whiskey
to keep out the night air.

776
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,192
Reckon I heard
about that.

777
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,128
Black Kettle had
an American flag

778

tied to the end
of a long pole.

779
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,757
When he saw us, he ordered
the women and children

780
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,096
to stand under the flag

781
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,160
so we'd be sure to see it.

782
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:29,797
And there's a real, live breeze
blowin' that mornin'.

off to my flank,

788
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,075
and I saw his lips move.

789
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,177
Couldn't make out what
he was sayin' at first.

790
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,983
He was always real quiet.

791
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,887
And then I could.

792
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,721
"No prisoners."

walkin' around in the smoke.

797
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,865
I was on the search party
to help kill the survivors.

00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,775
You couldn't see five feet
through the dust and smoke.

799
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,370
I reckon I got separated
from the rest.

800
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,779
I just reached down
off my horse

801
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,286

aboard and took off.

00:50:55,652 --> 00:51:01,716
You sign here...
and here and here.

892
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,384
I was wonderin' what you might
be able to tell me

893
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,859
about the land under
Mr. Brax's claim,

894
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,919
and Mrs. Potter's as well.

895
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:08,089
Not much.

896
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,030
Nothing special,
I can assure you.

897
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,658
Brax's mine played out

898
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,169
years before he went
off to war.

899
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,365
Ellis and Mary Potter's piece
abuts the Brax claim,

900
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,966
but there was never
much silver on it.

901
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,568
The vein runs, um,

902
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:26,207
north along
the picket wire,

903
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:30,413
and, um, Ellis's piece
runs due south.

904
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:33,183
Here, I, um...
See for yourself.

905
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:37,090
This is the original
Colorado Mining Company survey.

906
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,651
You can see
where it peters out.

907
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:41,959
There's no chance
of any vein discovered?

908
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,863
Discovered by who?

909
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,528
The real action's out west,
Mr. Scott.

910
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,504
The Comstock claim
in Virginia City,

911
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,165
not to mention California.

912
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,505
Then why drive
Mr. Brax off his claim?

913
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,442
It's the law, Mr. Scott.

914
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:57,343
I signed the papers myself.

915
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,780
He abandoned his claim
when he went to war.

916
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,750
And there are
plenty of people

917
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,809
coming west
now that the war is over.

918
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,479
We gotta make room
for them.

919
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,420
Doesn't quite seem fair.

920
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,823
This cabin you're living in

921
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:14,386
was built by someone too,
Mr. Scott.

922
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,558
But he had the misfortune
of dying at Vicksburg

923
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:21,138
instead of at home
in his own bed.

924
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:21,695
Instead of at home
in his own bed.

925
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,762
His wife and adopted daughter

926
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,569
were not of the Christian faith.

927
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,202
Tashi'ne asked that her sister
and Emil Brax,

928
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,610
be buried here today,

929
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,648
as he himself
was a Christian man.

930
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:33,774
This is dreadful.

931
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,374
I thought we left
all of this behind us.

932
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,147
Some people say
that Emil Brax,

933
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,018
in recent days,
had been a coward.

934
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,991
He died a hero,
defending his family.

935
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,084
The end of the war has
given honorable men

936
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,153
on both sides of this
recent conflict hope.

937
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,688
Hope that we could put
the evil of slavery behind us,

938
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:53,133
and hope that we could be
one nation under God,

939
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:56,502
and hope that we can finally
turn our back on evil.

940
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:58,973
Never turn your back on evil.

941
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,033
Who are you?

942
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,976
John Boone,
U.S. Marshall.

943
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:04,445
You'd be Kirby Scott.

944
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,074
JT said I'd find you
out here.

945
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,549
That's right.

946
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,653
This is
Miss Rebekah Shepard.

947
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,517
Land agent's daughter.

948
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:13,715
I don't understand.

949
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,314
I thought the sheriff
was the law.

950
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,553
I'm a Federal Marshall, Miss.

951
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,117
I cover the whole territory.

952
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,359
I understand you had a chance
to become JT's deputy.

953
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:23,524
You turned it down.

954
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,500
I came west
for different reasons.

955
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,400
I went to dental school, Scott.

956
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:31,406
Fate is what happens when
need collides with opportunity.

957
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,465
I don't need to be a lawman.

958
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,374
Well, who cares
what you need?

959
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:38,073
What about what she needed?

960
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:39,638
Are you content to mop up

961
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,445
after the damage is done?

962
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,078
Hell, a stable boy
could do that.

963
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,179
This is none
of my business.

964
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,247
Evil is all of our business.

965
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:00,998
Let us pray.

966
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,811
(woman)
Sheriff! Sheriff!

967
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,312
Father told me to tell you

968
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,144
there's some men
ridin' this way.

969
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:25,085
Will you look at that?

970
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:45,045
That's "Bloody" Bill Anderson's
outfit, isn't it?

971
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,709
(Sheriff)
What's left of 'em.

972
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:55,451
Who are they?

973
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:57,789
Marauders from
Kansas, Missouri.

974
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,453
Hell of a reputation.

975
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,520
Worse than Quantrell,
some say.

976
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:02,724
What do they want?

977
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,925
I don't know.

978
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,265
If that fella in the lead's
who I think he is...

979
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:11,034
I'm afraid I do.

980
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,608
You comin'?

981
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,149
Or you got
some moonlight plowin' to do?

982
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:58,551
Yeah.
But I got a better idea.

983
00:55:58,621 --> 00:55:59,356
[Chatter]

984
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,814
[Chatter]

985
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,519
(man)
Then don't play fair.

986
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:05,618
Play to win!

987
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,287
Just sit.

988
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,126
Amanda.

989
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,804
You're hoardin'
the prettiest girls.

990
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,576
Perhaps it airs
better over here.

991
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:29,482
Don't mean you need
both of 'em.

992
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,612
I have a hard time
makin' up my mind.

993
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:35,556
Reckon I can help you out
on that score.

994
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:42,496
Let's have some order
around here!

995
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,226
Who the hell are you?

996
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,167
He's a tin star, Lester.

997
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,636
Y'all blind?

998
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,434
You challenging my authority?

999
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:53,101
Lester?

1000
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:56,168
No.
But I think he might.

1001
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:00,675
Pretty tough
with this gun.

1002
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,947
How are you
without it?

1003
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,511
Fair.

1004
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:26,703
I'm gonna cut you real bad.

1005
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:29,273
Chance.

1006
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:30,744
Wouldn't advise that,
honey.

1007
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:32,281
Mm!

1008
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:36,307
[Together]
# Wish I was in the land
of cotton #

1009
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,354
# Old times there #

1010
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,480
# Are not forgotten #

1011
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:42,525
# Look away #

1012
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:46,028
# Look away
Look away #

1013
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:47,722
# Dixieland # #

1014
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:48,764
Dixieland.

1015
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,459
[Both laughing]

1016
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:53,434
Well, it's a coupla
fellow travelers.

1017
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:54,492
You, uh...

1018
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,402
You heard we lost the war.

1019
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,100
No! You hear that?

1020
00:57:58,174 --> 00:57:59,402
He's fibbin'.

1021
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,841
Oh, he don't look
like he's fibbin'.

1022
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,138
Nope!

1023
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,679
Robert E. Lee turned over
his sword

1024
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:06,647
to General Ulysses S. Grant
at Appomattox Courthouse

1025
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:08,343
on April 9th.

1026
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,909
A day that will live
in infamy!

1027
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,420
To Robert E. Lee!

1028
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,218
[All]
Robert E. Lee!

1029
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:18,788
Ooh-hoo.

1030
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:21,228
Well, that was not
good sportsmanship.

1031
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:22,525
I'm the law.

1032
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,226
Now I want you
to holster your weapons,

1033
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,768
and we'll come around
and collect 'em.

1034
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,770
Nobody's been bad hurt yet,

1035
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,328
and nobody has to be.

1036
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:32,874
You shouldn't have
oughta done this.

1037
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:35,604
I know who you are, Mister.

1038
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,908
You aren't wanted for anything
in this territory,

1039
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,040
but for what you animals
done back in Kansas,

1040
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,448
they oughta string the whole
lot of you up by the balls.

1041
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,282
It was war.

1042
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,755
That wasn't war.
It was slaughter!

1043
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:48,916
Uh-uh-uh.

1044
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,391
I would hate for this thing
to go off

1045
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,484
and expose your shortcomings.

1046
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:55,292
I believe, if I recall,
the war is over.

1047
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,128
So why don't you just
call it an evening?

1048
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,327
Fair enough.

1049
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,962
You men are not wanted here.

1050
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,437
But I understand
from Mr. Scott

1051
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:05,770
that your boss has got
personal business in the area.

1052
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,639
When that's settled,
I want you all

1053
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,644
outta here for good.

1054
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,010
I'm keeping your weapons
at the sheriff's office

1055
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:14,072
until you leave.

1056
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,693
[Gasps]

1057
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:25,750
Roy!

1058
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:26,817
Where is she?

1059
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,557
Well, you can't find her.

1060
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:29,598
[Cocks gun]

1061
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,065
Hello, Sarah.

1062
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:34,729
I'd hoped you died
in the war, Roy.

1063
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:36,567
I'm quite certain you did.

1064
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,573
She didn't mean that, Roy.

1065
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:39,573
No?

1066
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:41,200
She... we...

1067
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:43,245
I came for my granddaughter.

1068
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:46,248
She is happy here with me, Roy.

1069
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:47,840
Why don't you just
let her be?

1070
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,578
Where's Ellis?

1071
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:53,520
He passed away last month.

1072
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,989
Going back east, then?

1073
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,855
What business is that
of yours?

1074
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,791
Kathleen's not cut out
for that.

1075
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:01,125
What life can you offer her,
Roy?

1076
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:02,960
On the run?

1077
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,260
Going to leave her
stranded in some town

1078
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,494
where they decide to hang you?

1079
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:07,593
Just let her be, Roy,
please.

1080
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,036
Have her here
tomorrow at noon.

1081
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,630
Or I'll kill you both.

1082
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:25,381
Just move into the hotel
till they leave town, son.

1083
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,855
Oh, that's hardly
necessary, Sheriff.

1084
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,221
I can handle things.

1085
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,351
Like you did tonight?

1086
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:32,724
Figure I'll get my gear.

1087
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,057
I'll be back
at first light.

1088
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,360
I'll make arrangements
with Mother Smalley's

1089
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:38,229
You did a good job tonight.

1090
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,359
Both of you.

1091
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:41,369
Come on,
my big brother and I

1092
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,803
have some serious talking
to do.

1093
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:44,965
[Sigh]

1094
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:53,280
You saved my hide tonight,
Sodbuster.

1095
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,044
Don't make
a habit of it.

1096
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,349
I wasn't planning on it.

1097
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:00,821
Kirby, I'm so proud of you.

1098
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,653
Rachel and Chance
want to celebrate.

1099
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:04,124
Why not?

1100
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,923
You're welcome to come,
if you'd like.

1101
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,024
Reckon I'd see you
at sun-up.

1102
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:18,270
Till morning then.

1103
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,535
Hee-yah!

1104
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:22,305
[Horse whinnies]

1105
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:45,791
So Sergeant Rabbit,
you really volunteering

1106
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,392
for this mission?

1107
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:52,033
It ain't much.

1108
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,076
Lonely life.

1109
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:57,772
[Horse neighs]

1110
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,372
Well, duty calls, Sergeant.

1111
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,485
Call's for thee.

1112
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,890
Chance should probably be
out there with them.

1113
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:16,591
So?

1114
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,429
He makes me nervous.

1115
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:24,331
Why don't you just hide
your watch?

1116
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,398
Yah.

1117
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:36,753
We used to tie Rosie
up to a tree

1118
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,152
We used to tie Rosie
up to a tree

1119
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:39,620
and pretend she was Comanche.

1120
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:41,919
Went to supper once,
and couldn't recollect

1121
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:43,925
where we lashed her up.

1122
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:46,928
Ma nearly strung us up
at the smokehouse.

1123
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,931
As usual, Chance parlayed

1124
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,125
his way out of it.

1125
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,724
Our way out of it.

1126
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:55,293
[Laughs]

1127
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:58,872
You do charm all.

1128
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,738
Every day the sun shines.

1129
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,107
What happened
to your sister Rose?

1130
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,408
(Kirby)
She died of Typhus
before the war.

1131
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,412
Ma passed from consumption

1132
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:07,278
before Pa was killed
at Chickamauga.

1133
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,341
Sorry.

1134
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:10,783
No brothers of your own?

1135
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:14,345
No. Just me and Beck.

1136
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,414
Till I met Ben.

1137
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:21,327
You recollect how you meet
someone and you just...

1138
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:23,262
have to have them?

1139
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,892
Apple brown betty?

1140
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,300
Oh, I'd die for some.

1141
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:31,101
Rebekah was the best cook
in Tyler County.

1142
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,506
Won county fair
five years running.

1143
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:35,203
That I can believe.

1144
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:36,870
(Chance)
Kirby here

1145
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:39,972
won best sweet corn, best sow,

1146

1148
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,047
Thanks.

1149
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:49,182
You know I ain't lying,
big brother.

1150
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:53,490
Which is why this...

1151
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:56,031
don't figure at all.

1152
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:58,430
That's not something
I hanker for.

1153
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,695
Then don't do it.

1154
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:01,669
You don't owe
that stupid Marshall nothing.

1155
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:03,637
Rachel, this is supposed
to be a celebration.

1156
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:05,867
Why not celebrate him telling
that no good lawman

1157
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:06,874
to shove it up his...

1158
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:08,376
You're drunk!

1159
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:10,036
So?

1160
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,706
It's what Shannon pays me for,
ain't it?

1161
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:13,714
Among other things.

1162
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:17,275
You got no call
to say that!

1163
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,583
We each walk
our own paths.

1164
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:23,147
Tell that
to Miss High and Mighty.

1165
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:25,660

1166
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:29,425

1168
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,363
I'll make sure
she gets home.

1169

You coming?

1170
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,374
I think
I'll stay a while.

1171
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:55,584
I'd think on this
long and hard, Kirby.

1172
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:57,717
You threaten me now too,
little brother?

1173
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,624
You doing Shannon's
scut work?

1174
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:03,324
That's what he's got
McSweens and Lyons for.

1175
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:07,499
I just deal poker.

1176
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,664
And give advice.

1177
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,401
Good advice.

1178
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:25,977

getting involved in anything...

Sodbuster.

1186
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:22,435
If she's anything like
her sister, she ain't a lady.

1187
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:24,172
I guarantee it.

This is a better show
than the Del Star, huh?

See this jagged tear?

1217
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:09,371
So what?

1218
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:11,606
I saw that same jagged edge
the night the stage

1219
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,612
was held up.

1220
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:13,649
Come with me.

1221
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:15,714
Was I involved?

1222
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:21,188
You ought to be
arresting your man

for murdering my top hand.

1224
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:29,861
Or should I get John Boone
to do it?

1225
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:31,331
No, come off it, Del.

1226
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,424
Boone'd tell you

1227
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,264
to go to hell,
just like I would.

1228
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,531
We both know Lyons was filth.

1229
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:38,630
The question is,
were you behind it?

1230
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:40,675
In on robbing
my own payroll?

1231
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:43,041
Why the hell would I do
something like that?

1232
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:44,579
I don't know.

1233
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:47,810
That's why I always figured
you weren't involved.

It seems your brother

1246
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,544
wants to take over

1247
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,910
Mr. Lyons' position
in my organization.

1248
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:23,079
I don't believe you.

1249
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:25,518
I told you I came out west
to find my fortune, Kirby.

1250
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:27,681
Mr. Shannon's gonna
help me find it.

1251
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:29,189
This is about Rebekah,
isn't it?

1252
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:33,251
Leave my sister's name
out of this, you stupid cowboy.

1253
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:35,763
Or do you think
your brother's just with me

1254
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:38,800
'cause he can't have
what he really wants?

1255
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:40,357
That's not what I meant, Rachel.

1256
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:42,461
Get outta here.

1257
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:45,098
I said get outta here!

1258
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,939
(JT)
He's a good man, Del.

1259
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:57,110
Boone and I best not find
you're behind this.

1260
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:58,653
You won't.

1261
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,689
Is that because
you're innocent?

1262
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,782
Or just because you figure
we're not up to it?

1263
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:06,054
Take your pick, Sheriff.

1264
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:08,824
Take your pick.

1265
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,865
Go now, whoa! Ho.

1266
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,594
JT?

1267
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:14,067
Guess what? We made it.

1268
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:16,900
No robbery.
First time in six weeks.

1269
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:18,633
Well, that's great, Johnny.

1270
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,301
Got the mail too.
Here you go.

1271
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:25,506
Folks are gonna be
mighty hungry for it.

1272
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:26,741
Thank God.

1273
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:28,680
Maybe we'll finally have
that letter from Mother.

1274
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:29,843
Here you go, Violet.

1275
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:32,079
This is addressed
to Mr. Ellis Potter

1276
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:33,246
at the mining office.

1277
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:34,789
Looks like our curse is broken.

1278
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,586
You best give it
to that new fella.

1279
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:37,648
Shepard is his name.

1280
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:39,626
Yes, sir.
I'll see to it right away.

1281
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:41,424
Let's go.

1282
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:43,055
Yah!

1283
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:46,795
Mail and payroll got through.
No problem.

1284
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:49,394
Looks like
you may have been right.

1285
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,132
Telegraph arrived
for Marshall Boone.

1286
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:52,605
War department's

1287
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,768
gonna issue warrants
for Hobbs and his men.

1288
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:57,573
You don't look like
that's good news.

1289
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:00,581
Miss Sarah says that Roy
wants to take Kathleen today.

1290
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,674
Well, Boone's on the way
with the warrants.

1291
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,514
Ain't much we can do
till then.

1292
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:07,487
I could take 'em up to my place
till Marshall gets here.

1293
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:09,922
Well, reckon you could at that.

1294
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,662
I'll take that, Violet.

1295
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:18,700
But driver says to give it
to Mr. Jed.

1296
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:21,258
I always handle the mail,
Violet, you know that.

1297
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,328
Yes, sir.
But he said.

1298
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:25,839
That's okay, Matt.
I'll take it.

1299
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:29,937
What with the robberies,

1300
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:32,412
this is the first mail
we've had in six weeks.

1301
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:33,675
That so?

1302
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:37,614
Why don't you let me

1303
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:38,948
take care of that, Jed?

1304
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,046
Ellis always liked me
to handle the mail.

1305
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:43,557
That's okay, I'll get to it
in a moment.

1306
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:50,588
Griff?

1307
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,896
How would a couple
of your hound hoots here

1308
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:56,665
like to make themselves
some traveling money?

1309

[Horse neighs]

1310
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:16,314
Why, hello, Miss Rebekah.

1311
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:20,692
I was wondering if there was
someplace we could go to talk.

1312
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:28,427
You didn't tell me
you were bringing lunch.

1313
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:30,972
Well, the way
to a man's heart...

1314
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,301
is to be honest.

1315
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:34,535
Though cooking never hurts.

1316
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,078
[Laughs]

1317
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,307
Chance, about last night...

1318
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:41,315
There's nothing
to explain.

1319
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:44,113
You made your choice
and I made mine.

1320
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:45,619
What do you mean?

1321
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:47,314
Me and Rachel.

1322
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:49,482
Didn't you already know?

1323
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:51,719
Chance, you can't
be with Rachel.

1324
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,319
You sound like Kirby.

1325
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,330
Why can't the two of you
just accept

1326
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:58,093
Rachel's the love
of my life?

1327
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:01,625
Love?
I should hardly think so.

1328
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:02,897
Okay.

1329
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:05,303
So it ain't love.

1330
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:08,172
She's just great
in the sack.

1331
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:38,370
Hey, girlie.

1332
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,034
Ain't you supposed to be
picking cotton?

1333
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:43,339
Or are you too busy
taking jobs away

1334
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:45,471
from good white folk?

1335
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:48,744
Or sashaying around town
pretending you're good as us?

1336
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:50,341
Y'all leave me alone.

1337
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,444
Or my pappy'll come to town
and whip you good.

1338
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:53,988
Let me go! Uh!

1339

[Horse whinnies]

1340

Expecting your pappy's
a lot more used to

1341
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:02,158
the other end of this whip.

1342
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:03,755
My pappy
wasn't no slave.

1343
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:06,630
Wasn't ever no slave.
He's a free man.

1344
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:09,364
What'd he do?
Sell your brother and sister?

1345
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:12,134
Or leap off the ship
and keep running.

1346
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:13,139
See here, you men.

1347
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,768
Let her go.

1348
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,745
Will you look at
the fancy Yankee.

1349
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:23,080
Come to free the slaves like
your skinny-ass Abe Lincoln.

1350
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:25,210
You remember what happened
to him last month, don't you?

1351
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:26,481
Got what he deserved.

1352
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:29,285
Mr. John Booth, Yankee.
Patriot.

1353
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,588
John Booth was
a despicable coward.

1354
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:33,719
That make us cowards too,
Yankee?

1355
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,092
If the boot fits, wear it.

1356
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:37,688
Jed! Mr. JT!

1357

Mr. JT!

1360
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:44,928
You men stop this.

1361
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:46,941
Let her go.
Let her go!

1362
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:48,636
Where'd you men
get those weapons?

1363
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:49,836
Oh, these?

1364
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:51,038
Reckon we got 'em
from your old friends

1365
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:52,603
down at the saloon.

1366
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:54,546
Or maybe they weren't
your friends after all.

1367
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:57,107
They don't like you very much
down there, Sheriff.

1368
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:02,414
You men hand over those weapons
before somebody gets hurt.

1369

Someone. Someone like you.

1370
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,426
Maybe we'd better let it go.

1371
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:09,157
Let it go?
Not till you apologize, Yankee.

1372
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,698
Not till you crawl over here

1373
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:12,063
and lick the dirt
off my boot.

1374
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:13,761
Clear out of here, Mr. Shepard.

like this'd be dead by now.

1420
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,447
But your father's in
fairly decent physical shape.

1421
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:24,508
And that helps, believe me.

1422
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:28,545
And JT here is tougher
than rawhide.

1423
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:31,217
What does that mean,
back shot?

1424
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:33,853
Well, the bullet enters the back
and there's a small hole,

1425
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,556
and comes out in front.

1426
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:37,723
I thought they were
in a gunfight.

1427
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:38,891
There's no telling

1428
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:40,867
about a gunfight, Ma'am.

1429
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:43,769
Especially in this town.

1430
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:48,059
My God.

1431
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:51,003
Who did this?

1432
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:52,903
Those men who came in
last night...

1433
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:55,067
No, please.

1434
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:58,135
Those men will be gone soon.

1435
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:05,351
Are they gonna make it, Doc?

1436
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:10,481
It's like drawing
to an inside straight.

1437
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:27,902
Who's winning?

1438
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:32,009
Reckon it ain't you.

1439
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,775
You know about this
in advance?

1440
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:36,817
Why don't you ask
your girlfriend?

1441
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:39,285
I've got myself
one hell of an alibi.

1442
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:42,084
I didn't ask you if you did it.
Did you know about it?

1443
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:45,291
No.

1444
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,328
Leave him alone.

1445
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:50,626
That's your own father,
Miss Rachel.

1446
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:53,691
My father's been sticking his
nose in other people's business.

1447
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,565
Saving a young black woman's
life.

1448
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,867
Ain't that how we all
got into this?

1449
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:02,273
On the nose, brother Chance.

1450
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:13,178
You Yankees could just not leave
well enough alone.

1451
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:15,950
Everybody was happy.

1452
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:17,855
Everybody knew their place.

1453
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:20,258
I got nothing against
the negroes.

1454
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,159
They's as good
as three-fifths of a person

1455
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:23,629
as you gonna find.

1456
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:26,667
I just don't want 'em voting
or owning businesses.

1457
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,362
Or mixing where
they don't belong.

1458
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:30,370
War's over, Greg.
You lost.

1459
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:32,338
How naive are you, friend?

1460
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:35,433
That argument is gonna last
100 years.

1461
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,375
Maybe it's time to go,
little brother?

1462
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:39,777
Are you saying that
I've gotta pick a side?

1463
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,817
Uh-uh.
I like it right here.

1464
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:44,784
You wasting your air, Griff.

1465
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:46,548
Kirby here has never
mastered the art

1466
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:48,521
of saying the right thing.

1467
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,922
Big brother has to actually
go and do the right thing.

1468
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:53,552
Nearly got the boy killed
in Chancellorsville.

1469
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:55,289
And Vicksburg.

1470
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:59,663
Hmm, perhaps today
is his lucky day.

1471
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:26,554
Keep the faith, Rebekah.

1472
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:44,877
[Screams]

1473
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,408
You stick your head outside,
you son of a bitch,

1474
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:50,383
I'll blow her head off.

1475
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:16,403
[Door opening]

1476
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:18,200
Hello, Mr. Elden.

1477
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:20,173
I'd like to ask you

1478
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:21,208
a few questions.

1479
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:22,208
Of course, son.

1480
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:24,268
Take a seat.

1481
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:29,246
How's Jedediah?

1482
01:26:29,317 --> 01:26:30,944
He's not doing too good.

1483
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,078
I'm sorry to hear that.

1484
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:34,985
Seemed like a good man.

1485
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:36,250
Yes, sir.

1486
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:38,121
It's part of what almost
got him killed.

1487
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,785
Ah, yes.

1488
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:43,319
The young lady.
That's bad.

1489
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:45,525
I'm hoping you might
clear something up for me.

1490
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,124
Be glad to.

1491
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,863
I'd like to take another look
at that mineral plot

1492
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:50,234
you showed me yesterday.

1493
01:26:50,305 --> 01:26:52,705
Of course.

1494
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:57,040
Here you go.

1495
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:58,271
This...

1496
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:02,339
is the mining plot for my deed.

1497
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:03,475
If you notice,

1498
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,712
the legend on your map
is upside-down.

1499
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:08,244
I see.

1500
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:09,950
Which means that
this silver vein

1501
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:12,117
is actually running south
through Mr. Brax's claim.

1502
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:14,058
Across into Ellis Potter's

1503
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:15,789
and into my own.

1504
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:16,795
Now, if we're dead

1505
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:18,525
or run off our land,

1506
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,501
these claims revert back
to your bank, Mr. Elden.

1507
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:23,036
And to you.

1508
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,774
Well, isn't that something?

1509
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,935
I know you didn't do it
alone, Mr. Elden.

1510
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:34,641
Del Shannon and Lyons

1511
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:37,184
were in on it with you.

1512
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,747
Did Shannon
kill Ellis Potter?

1513
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:43,017
Or did you?

1514
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,992
I'm afraid that was Del's doing.

1515
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:50,793
You see, Ellis discovered the
government's error one night.

1516
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:53,925
A lot of mistakes were made
in Washington during the war.

1517
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:58,200
The emphasis was on war maps.

1518
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,400
And as to the rest of it...

1519
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:03,069
Well...

1520
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:05,009
The stage holdups weren't
for the money at all.

1521
01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:07,104
It was just to stop the mail.

1522
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:08,876
Keep the sheriff
and the land agent

1523
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,076
from getting those new maps.

1524
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:12,016
At least until Mr. Brax
was dead

1525
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:14,486
and Mr. Potter was back
in Virginia.

1526
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:19,185
Which leaves only you,
Mr. Scott.

1527
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,228
You ever kill anybody,
Mr. Elden?

1528
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,355
Can't say that I have.

1529
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:25,331
It's not that easy.

1530
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:29,166
Ooh, I think I'll get
the hang of it.

01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:36,877
And then Griff here opened fire
on JT and the new land agent.

1596
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:39,276
I'm gonna have to
dock your pay for that.

1597
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:43,113
You know, your brother can be
a real pain in the ass.

1598
01:33:43,184 --> 01:33:45,049
Men, y'all know

1599
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:48,282
how many of our close friends
and associates

1600
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:52,122
were sent to their reward
by Mr. Scott here.

1601
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:55,992
A year's salary

1602
01:33:56,063 --> 01:33:58,759
to the first man
who sends Mr. Scott

1603
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:01,131
to his.

1604
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:07,240
You can't do this.
The whole town will know.

1605
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:09,367
I built this town!

1606
01:34:09,443 --> 01:34:12,310
And no Yankee, Reb,

1607
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:15,645
or lawman, or war, for that
matter's, gonna take this

1608
01:34:15,716 --> 01:34:17,479
away from me!

1609
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:19,610
Let's go, Shannon.

1610
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:21,018
You too, Griff.

1611
01:34:21,088 --> 01:34:23,215
Clint?

1612
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:28,718
I believe it's your deal.

1613
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:12,269
Kirby!

1614
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:19,236
Chance!

1615
01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:20,746
Step away from him.

1616
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:21,873
No.

1617
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:23,917
Step away from him!

1618
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:26,612
No. It's over.

1619
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:31,892
I'll be the judge of that.

1620
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:35,458
Boone.

1621
01:35:38,132 --> 01:35:40,032
Stay out of this, old man.

1622
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:42,160
Time we settled old scores, Del.

1623
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:43,362
Why not?

1624
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:48,532
Wipe the slate clean.

1625
01:35:48,609 --> 01:35:50,236
My thoughts exactly.

1626
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:52,108
[Cocks gun]

1627
01:36:18,572 --> 01:36:20,665
Time to go, folks.

1628
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:22,140
Ready, Mr. Scott?

1629
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:23,699
As I'll ever be.

1630
01:36:26,747 --> 01:36:27,805
Everything in order, Jed?

1631
01:36:27,882 --> 01:36:30,146
Tashi'ne here
is the rightful owner

1632
01:36:30,217 --> 01:36:31,616
of Brax's land.

1633
01:36:31,685 --> 01:36:34,017
And Kirby gets those
under his land as well.

1634
01:36:34,088 --> 01:36:37,285
Looks like when that arm heals,
you may be a wealthy man.

1635
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:40,293
I've got all I need right here.

1636
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:44,731
Am I missing the double wedding?

1637
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,266
Not yet.

1638
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:47,960
Right now Chance and I
want to see

1639
01:36:48,035 --> 01:36:49,502
what's a little further west.

1640
01:36:49,570 --> 01:36:52,539
Not much for settling down.
That's more Kirby's style.

1641
01:36:52,606 --> 01:36:54,198
We'll see.

1642
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:57,438
You gonna stick around
and be a deputy, Mr. Scott?

1643
01:36:57,511 --> 01:36:59,604
I reckon I could help out
once in a while.

1644
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:00,977
If I'm not in the way.

1645
01:37:01,048 --> 01:37:02,538
I'll be sure that he does.

1646
01:37:02,616 --> 01:37:04,413
I'm glad to hear it.

1647
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:07,045
You know, I'm not gonna
be around forever.

1648
01:37:07,121 --> 01:37:09,385
Someday maybe you'll be
after my job.

1649
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:12,516
I think I'll stick
a little closer to home.

1650
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:19,157
I'll see you folks
in the by-and-by.

1651
01:37:19,233 --> 01:37:20,860
Light's getting yellow, Chance.

1652
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:28,174
Bye, big brother.

1653
01:37:28,242 --> 01:37:29,174
Don't be a stranger.

1654
01:37:29,243 --> 01:37:30,733
Oh, we'll be back.

1655
01:37:30,811 --> 01:37:32,574
Besides, you're gonna be
a rich man.

1656
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:35,581
Can't play poker
with the dead.

1657
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:53,860
I'm gonna miss them.

1658
01:37:53,934 --> 01:37:54,992
A lot.

1659
01:37:55,069 --> 01:37:56,969
[Speaking native language]

1660
01:37:57,037 --> 01:37:59,028
Go with God, brother.

1661
01:38:01,242 --> 01:38:04,177
Go with God.
