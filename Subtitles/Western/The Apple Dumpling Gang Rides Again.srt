It's Shoshone again, sir.

7
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,245
- And our wagon.
- Yes, sir.

8
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:17,249
Private Higgins and Corporal Albright
took it to the supply depot last week.

9
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,376
This belonged
to Corporal Albright.

10
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:24,356
Must have hit them coming out
of Sam Young Canyon.
Stripped it and put the torch to it.

11
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:26,483
- Take care of the mounts, Corporal.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

12
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,427
Lieutenant Ravencroft,
in the last three months,
the army has lost...

13
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:32,465
over 40 cases
of Springfield carbines.

14
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:36,696
<i>Twice that amount</i>
<i>of army issue handguns,</i>
<i>saddles, blankets and rations.</i>

15
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,364
Enough to supply
two forts this size.

16
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,706
<i>And all those thefts</i>
<i>occurred in territory under</i>
<i>the protection of this fort.</i>

17
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:46,746
I realize that, sir.

18
00:02:48,548 --> 00:02:50,812
I want you to mount
another patrol, Lieutenant.

19
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:54,115
Take as many men as you need,
the best scouts we have...

20
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:56,747
and find out what happened
to those supplies!

21
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:59,383
- Yes, sir.
- Jim...

22
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:04,896
I'm running out of explanations
to Washington.

23
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:08,492
If these raids don't stop...

24
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:12,060
it could mean...
my command here.

25
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:16,598
I understand, sir.
I'll leave immediately.

26
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:36,695
Boy, I sure miss Dusty, Donovan,
and the kids...

27
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:38,788

ringing on the farm.

28
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:42,631
Now don't start again, Amos.
Is that how you want to
go down in the history books?

29
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:46,194
"After terrorizing the West,
they ended up as farmers...

30
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:48,707
milkin' cows
and collectin' eggs."

31
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:52,541
- Is that what you want?
- Well, no, not exactly, but...

32
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:56,070
boy, Dusty sure could make
those biscuits and honey.

33
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,424
You just stick with me.

34
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:08,188
I tell ya, Amos, people are gettin' rich
in these boom towns...

35
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,991
and there's no reason why a couple
of smart hombres like us...

36
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:14,591
- can't double or even triple
our stake overnight.
- Double?

37
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:17,228
We got $300.43 now.

38
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:20,967
If we double that tonight,
then we triple that
tomorrow night, that'd be, uh...

39
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,943
- that'd be... carry the one...
- Kind of gets you
to thinkin', don't it?

40
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:27,980
- Six... no, four... three...
- First thing we gotta do is
get ourselves spiffied up.

41
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:31,142
- Then we'll take this town
like Grant took Richmond.
- That's right.

42
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:35,620
I get ya now.
How do you think we go about...

43
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,714
Howdy.

44
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:42,285
Say, um, how do you figure
going about that?

45
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:46,526
Well, uh, I'm still workin'
on the particulars.

46
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,728
I'll tell you one thing: We ain't gonna
dry gulch no one no more.

47
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:53,500
Yeah, and you ain't
gonna get us mixed up
in none of those bank robberies.

48

- Shh.

49

callin' us out?

50

I was assigned to escort you.

60
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:52,463
Well, you see,
there've been some problems
at the fort, ma'am...

61
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:55,296
and I guess they were needed
for more important duties.

62
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:02,002
It's a bit warmer
than I expected.

63
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:04,942
I'd best get some lighter clothing
before we leave.

64
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:07,138
You can take care of this
in the meantime...

65
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:11,479

have our picture took?

stop her before she busted up
the whole place?

the picture said, "Take a

01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:14,654
If everything goes well,
I figure we should be able to
meet back here in 45 minutes.

815
01:05:14,724 --> 01:05:17,420
An hour, at the outside.

816
01:05:17,493 --> 01:05:21,224
$50,000 an hour.
That's pretty good pay.

817
01:05:33,176 --> 01:05:35,804
[Gasps]

818
01:05:39,182 --> 01:05:43,278
Uh, could you direct us to the
Bridger Military Prison, please?

819
01:05:43,352 --> 01:05:45,980
Who the blazes are you?

820
01:05:46,055 --> 01:05:48,819
Ya ever hear of the
Apple Dumpling Gang, punk?

821
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:51,693
Why didn't you say so?

822
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:53,888
I hear you wanna see me.

823
01:05:53,963 --> 01:05:58,161
Maybe we do, maybe we don't.
Whose little boy are you?

824
01:05:58,234 --> 01:06:01,169
[Chuckling]

825
01:06:03,506 --> 01:06:05,497
I'm Mac.

826
01:06:05,575 --> 01:06:08,738
Mac who, fuzzy face?

827
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:26,552
That Mac.
Probably wants to talk to you.

828
01:06:27,864 --> 01:06:31,561
Uh, we just wanted
to say howdy.

829
01:06:33,469 --> 01:06:35,528
Howdy.

830
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:38,073
How long were you there
and what'd you hear?

831
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:40,837
Oh, nothing.
We just got here, Mr. Mac.

832
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:43,902
We didn't hear nothing
about any train robbery, did we?

833
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,279
No, no. Didn't hear nothing
about the money either.

834
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:50,911
- Boys.
- Wait a minute.

835
01:06:52,255 --> 01:06:55,850
Mac, we can use a couple
of extra guns on this job.

836
01:06:57,293 --> 01:06:59,955
Yeah, I hear you boys
are pretty handy with the iron.

837
01:07:00,029 --> 01:07:04,864
That's right. Pound for pound,
we're the best in the West.

838
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:08,530
<i>[Big Mac]</i>
<i>Well, good.</i>

839
01:07:08,604 --> 01:07:14,406
Yes. [Chuckling] Well, here.
We'll give you a chance to prove it.

840
01:07:22,552 --> 01:07:25,487
[Chuckling]

841
01:07:25,555 --> 01:07:28,080
Well, now that's
what I call shootin'.

842
01:07:28,157 --> 01:07:30,853
Maybe we can
use you boys.

843
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:34,556
Uh, are you gentlemen
prisoners here?

844
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,564
When we feel like it.

845
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:42,098
<i>It ain't all that surprisin'</i>
<i>when you know the story.</i>

846
01:07:42,171 --> 01:07:45,402
See, Bridger here
was built by army prisoners.

847
01:07:45,474 --> 01:07:48,307
When they was digging the foundation,
they found these caverns.

848
01:07:48,377 --> 01:07:51,904
[Chuckling]
A few of the boys just
kept it under their hat.

849
01:07:51,981 --> 01:07:54,449
Figured they'd use it later
to bust out.

850
01:07:54,517 --> 01:07:57,748
[Chuckles]
But it turned out to be
the perfect hideout.

851
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:03,122
Now, where's the last place the
law would look for a person that
was robbin' a supply wagon?

852
01:08:03,192 --> 01:08:05,854
Why, that's a toughie.
Now, where is the last place...

853
01:08:05,928 --> 01:08:07,623
- Prison.
- Huh?

854
01:08:07,697 --> 01:08:10,427
You got a head
on you, boy.

855
01:08:10,499 --> 01:08:12,433
Just barely.

856
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:17,836
So we figured why bust out
and be on the dodge
the rest of our lives.

857
01:08:17,907 --> 01:08:22,037
Stay in prison and run the whole
operation from here. Live like kings.

858
01:08:22,111 --> 01:08:24,102
Come and go when we want.

859
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:27,775
Feel the need for a little relaxation,
a little female companionship...

860
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:29,715
we just ride into town.

861
01:08:29,785 --> 01:08:31,878
Makes life in prison
very comfortable.

862
01:08:31,954 --> 01:08:34,980
Does Warden Waddell
know about this?

863
01:08:35,057 --> 01:08:38,891
No! Nobody does,
but the seven of us.

864
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:42,055
Well, nine of us now
and the outside man.

865
01:08:42,131 --> 01:08:45,828
- Who's that?
- You'll meet him when the time comes.

866
01:08:45,901 --> 01:08:48,836
The outside man lets us know
when there's a wagon...

867
01:08:48,904 --> 01:08:51,338
or a shipment coming through
with somethin' worthwhile on it.

868
01:08:51,407 --> 01:08:53,568
<i>He gets a cut</i>
<i>for his trouble.</i>

869
01:08:53,643 --> 01:08:56,840
<i>You'll get yours too</i>
<i>if you handle yourselves</i>
<i>all right.</i>

870
01:08:58,247 --> 01:09:00,875
We'll be watching ya.
[Chuckles]

871
01:09:04,987 --> 01:09:07,922
We'll slip into town
one or two at a time.

872
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:12,188
- You two know where your spot is?
- The Variety Saloon.

873
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:15,196
I want everyone
in place at 12:00 sharp.

874
01:09:15,264 --> 01:09:17,323
And you better be there.

875
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,062
12:00 sharp.
Don't worry.

876
01:09:20,136 --> 01:09:22,696
Giddap!
Come on!

877
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:30,245
You know, Theodore.
Robbin' army payroll
ain't exactly goin' straight.

878
01:09:30,313 --> 01:09:34,079
We ain't robbed no payroll yet, Amos,
and we ain't goin' to.

879
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:36,175
I'm thinkin' on a plan.

880
01:09:36,252 --> 01:09:38,482
Better come up with it by noon.

881
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:41,648
If you don't have it by noon...
Wait for me.

882
01:09:43,592 --> 01:09:46,891
All we gotta do
is have the sheriff in this town...

883
01:09:46,962 --> 01:09:49,260
Iock us up
under protective custody.

884
01:09:49,332 --> 01:09:53,325
Then we just lay back and let him
handle the rest. We'll be heroes.

885
01:09:59,008 --> 01:10:03,604
If you're looking for Sheriff Vaughn,
he's over at the Widow Bradshaw's.

886
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,171
<i>Seems a fox has been gettin'</i>
<i>into her chicken house again.</i>

887
01:10:07,249 --> 01:10:12,084
Hmm! Usually takes the sheriff
about a week to settle the matter.

888
01:10:12,154 --> 01:10:14,918
- A week?
- Yeah, we can't... A week?

889
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:18,824
We can't wait a week.
I mean, already the little hand's
on 12, big hand's on 11.

890
01:10:18,894 --> 01:10:22,352
<i>You need a lawman, the federal marshal's</i>
<i>down at the Variety's.</i>

891
01:10:23,566 --> 01:10:26,364
- Let's go! Come on!
- Hey, Theodore.

892
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:29,131
Are we in more trouble here
or back in Junction City?

893
01:10:29,205 --> 01:10:32,231
When you're in this much trouble,
it can't get worse.

894
01:10:35,644 --> 01:10:39,740
[Clears Throat] Howdy.
Uh, we're lookin' for the marshal.

895
01:10:39,815 --> 01:10:42,648
We've got a marshal here, of sorts.

896
01:10:42,718 --> 01:10:45,778
But I don't know as he can handle
your complaint though.

897
01:10:45,855 --> 01:10:48,255
- I'm sure he can.
- Oh, sure he can. Where is he?

898
01:10:48,324 --> 01:10:50,849
Right over there.

899
01:10:50,926 --> 01:10:55,192
- [Groaning]
<i>- It's the famous Marshal</i>
<i>Woolly Bill Hitchcock.</i>

900
01:10:55,264 --> 01:10:58,700
He's just a shell of a man he was
before the Apple Dumpling Gang
got away from him.

901
01:10:58,768 --> 01:11:00,895
- Shall I wake him up?
- [Both] Uh, no, no.

902
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:03,063
- Let him sleep. We're just leaving.
- Thank you very much.

903
01:11:22,725 --> 01:11:25,353
- Where's the backdoor?
- In the back.

904
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:43,644

Where's the two

909
01:12:08,204 --> 01:12:10,764
They'll be here.
They better.

910
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,138
Where we goin'?
I can't see.

911
01:12:13,209 --> 01:12:15,837
I don't know.
Just act nonchalant.
