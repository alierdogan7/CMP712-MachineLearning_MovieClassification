1
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,707
It's a story about animals.

2
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:44,749
The story took place in a barren land.

3
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,082
I hate to bring up about animals...

4
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,665
...but one of my high school teacher...

5
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,074
...always loved about telling
a story on ancient monkeys.

6
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,291
He said there were two monkeys...

7
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,749
...in order not to be eaten by tigers...

8
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,040
...while they are picking up peaches,

9
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,708
they decided to cooperate.

10
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,665
First monkey would go up and pick,

11
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,043
the second monkey looks
out for the first monkey.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,499
In return, the first monkey would
give half of the food to the second monkey.

13
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,332
However, the sentry monkey
could never leave it's duty.

14
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,655
It requires those two monkeys...

15
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,351
...should never only think about itself.

16
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:16,833
As a result,

17
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,332
those two monkeys become
a group of monkeys.

18
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,499
This group of monkeys become human beings.

19
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:27,249
Our story starts with this bird.

20
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,083
Ay!

21
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,625
Give me a cigarette.

22
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,832
Do you know Muhammad?

23
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,124
He's an Arabian prince.

24
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,415
I hunted this falcon for him.

25
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,083
Cost him a million RMB.

26
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,749
See, you take half of the money...

27
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,416
...and let me go with the other half.

28
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,958
Sounds good?

29
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:10,875
Ok, never mind.

30
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,874
It's all yours if you're letting me go.

31
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:17,957
Keep talking.

32
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,915
Hello. Do you hear things?

33
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,583
Hello!

34
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,875
You are good person,

35
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,415
but good things don't always
happen to good people!

36
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,416
Hey!

37
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
Are you nuts?

38
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,124
You almost ran me over!

39
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,874
Brain-dead asshole.

40
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,457
I tried to reason with him.

41
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,082
Hey, say something!

42
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,416
Hey.

43
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:06,624
Is there anyone?

44
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,916
Hey, what's going on?

45
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,958
We're fucked...

46
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,415
...there's only one road out...

47
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,165
...and both sides are gonna be blocked.

48
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,833
We can't run out of this.

49
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,040
Take the falcon and just go.
I'll call the police.

50
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,624
When I become a lawyer,

51
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,374
I recall the monkey story.

52
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,832
And I just want to tell my teacher,

53
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,165
humans are not really humans...

54
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,040
...until they learned to use fire,

55
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,540
not because they abandoned selfishness.

56
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,208
Hey! Come here!

57
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,375
The car is broken!

58
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,374
Hey hey hey, let's go!

59
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,916
Hi, greeting!

60
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,166
Hello.

61
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,916
I'm Pan Xiao.

62
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,500
We've spoken on the phone.

63
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,249
I pretty much understand your situations.

64
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,720
There are two more questions I need to ask.

65
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,415
Do you think you could handle this?

66
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,374
There are two things I'd like to mention.

67
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,540
First of all, I took ten
hours train to here.

68
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,790
But what I didn't know is to arrive here, I
have to take another 3 hours horse carriage.

69
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,207
I am not asking for money,

70
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,999
I am talking about opportunity cost.

71
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,790
We can always earn more money,

72
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,124
but when times gone, they're gone forever.

73
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,832
Do you think you could handle this?

74
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,332
Please, listen to me first.

75
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,791
Consider this a new habit,

76
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,995
because we're gonna do the
exactly thing on court. OK?

77
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,958
Secondly,

78
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,790
your case is kind of complicated.

79
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,874
I can't know for sure that we could win.

80
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:52,226
Therefore,

81
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,091
the payment of the remaining
fund is important.

82
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,916
It seems you can handle this.

83
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,499
When I am going back, I am not gonna
take horse carriage anymore right?

84
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,041
I never loved animals.

85
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,500
I especially hate horses.

86
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,665
It's clear what happened.

87
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,165
The defendant murdered a police officer...

88
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,833
...while poaching protected birds.

89
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,625
The prosecution rests.

90
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,208
Will the defense please begin?

91
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,958
Thank you, Your Honor.

92
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,165
We don't hear a single word...

93
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,124
...from my defendant on this tape.

94
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,124
So, I don't understand what
this so-called evidence...

95
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,791
...has to do with my client.

96
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:41,624
I'll show you!

97
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,540
Altai falcon feathers were in the vehicle.

98
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:44,415
I suspect...

99
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,624
You say you "suspect" you "think"...

100
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:47,290
...but that's not enough.

101
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,999
The law requires proof.

102
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:53,582
What you're providing are clues, not proof.

103
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,457
Let me demonstrate "proof".

104
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,333
Officer Wang,

105
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,832
on the day of the crime,

106
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,915
did you have lunch with the victim?

107
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,333
Yes.

108
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,415
Did you consume alcohol?

109
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,625
I don't remember.

110
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,541
I present to the court...

111
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,290
...the receipt for the meal.

112
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:20,040
Officer Wang ate with the
victim at Dafudi restaurant.

113
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,750
It has your signature.

114
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,291
Thank you.

115
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,957
You ordered roasted lamb...

116
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,707
...one bottle of Songzhuang liquor,

117
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,999
and four bottles of beer.

118
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,415
Quite a lot of alcohol.

119
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,582
So, we can only conclude...

120
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,270
...that your consumption of alcohol...

121
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:39,040
...was the direct cause of this accident.

122
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,790
And Officer Wang, frankly,

123
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,082
you're an indirect cause of this tragedy.

124
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Say that again!

125
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,832
You know very well what happened that day!

126
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,582
I've had enough of your bullshit!

127
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,499
Objection! Your honor.

128
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,166
This is personal attack!

129
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,457
You're a good lawyer,

130
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,374
and a friend I'd like to make.

131
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,291
I'm sorry,

132
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,249
my liver has some functional disorder.

133
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,666
That's why I don't drink.

134
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,045
If you're satisfied with
the results of the case,

135
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,861
let's make the best of our time...

136
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:16,665
Well, let's wrap this up.

137
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,333
I'll wire the rest of your money...

138
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:23,332
...into your account within ten days.

139
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,999
C'mon, you shouldn't screw with lawyers.

140
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,750
It's ten days.

141
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,999
Do you know how much
effective time people have in their lives?

142
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,374
Outside of sleeping,
eating, and bullshitting,

143
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,374
It comes out to a little
over 100,000 hours.

144
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,415
And you actually want me to wait 10 days.

145
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,791
That car.

146
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,291
Do you see it?

147
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,540
It's a little too red, isn't it?

148
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,415
My wife liked it.

149
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,540
I went away on business this year...

150
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,332
...and when I came back,

151
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,416
I heard she'd had an accident.

152
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,415
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

153
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,290
But I bought the color anyway.

154
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,874
Because I promised her I would.

155
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,790
So, rest assured.

156
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,708
People like me...

157
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,416
...intend to keep the promises.

158
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,750
How much is your car worth?

159
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,421
It seems your wife doesn't
need it anymore huh?

160
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,040
So you should leave me
the car as collateral.

161
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,458
You can't have...

162
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,708
...the car.

163
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,583
Really?

164
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,000
Look here.

165
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,540
I've signed this receipt.

166
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,916
It proves that

167
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,541
I bought this bottle of alcohol.

168
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,583
But who can tell...

169
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,145
...that I actually have been drinking?

170
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,583
So.

171
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,082
You really want the car huh?

172
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,083
Here. Sign.

173
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,208
Do you believe...

174
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,416
...I ran into that police car...

175
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,540
...intentionally?

176
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,833
Or not?

177
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,750
Sorry.

178
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,635
That's outside of my
professional competence.

179
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,875
You're a good lawyer.

180
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:39,833
Thank you.

181
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,333
Hey, pal!

182
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,707
There's only one road out
of this place, right?

183
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,000
That's what it looks like.

184
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,708
I need to see your license.

185
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,958
Name?

186
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,208
Pan Xiao.

187
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,375
Occupation?

188
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,540
I thought you knew?

189
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,208
Answer the question!

190
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,708
Lawyer.

191
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,333
Can I go?

192
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,040
You only lost a conviction.

193
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,791
Is it worth the anger?

194
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:20,999
I swear to god...

195
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,165
...if I weren't a cop, I'd kick your ass.

196
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,541
Too bad you're a cop.

197
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,875
Thank you sir.

198
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,000
What the fuck are you?

199
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,458
The merchandise is on the move.

200
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,708
We can't afford another delay.

201
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,208
Think of something.

202
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,875
I know.

203
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,583
Hi, Michael.

204
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,790
- It's me.
- Mr. Pan.

205
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:37,707
- We're gonna make a big scene tomorrow.
- Not a problem!

206
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,832
Have you invited media for
the book release tomorrow?

207
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,582
Yes, more than 30 of them.

208
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,457
Well, invite more.

209
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,907
- The more the better.
- The costs' gonna be much higher!

210
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,666
We gotta take this big.

211
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,957
Fame and fortune are two related brothers.

212
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,457
Fame brings fortune...

213
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,466
...and you can't buy fame
without the fortune!

214
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,999
The second thing is write
up something for the press.

215
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:53,957
What's it gonna be?

216
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:54,790
You don't even know this?

217
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:55,624
Ay ya!

218
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,632
Famous lawyer went to a
distant border area...

219
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,915
...and won justice for a
wrongly accused man.

220
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,083
What about the content?

221
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,250
Our legal wire reports...

222
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,082
...not long ago...

223
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,415
...our journalist...

224
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,623
...has had accompanied with
famous lawyer Pan Xiao,

225
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,915
whose English name is Sean Pan,

226
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,123
been to the no man's land
in Northwest rural China.

227
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,082
Hello?

228
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,791
Get down here!

229
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,750
Get down here now!

230
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,750
Wipe it off!

231
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,458
Can't talk to you!

232
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,666
I forgive you this time.

233
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,955
That's gonna be the most
expensive slap of your life.

234
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,875
What are you doing?

235
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,375
Hey, get back in the truck...

236
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:42,976
...both of you!

237
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,500
You hear me?

238
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,208
What are you doing?

239
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,082
Hey! Hey!

240
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,750
"Hey"what, boy? "Hey" what?

241
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,790
C'mon, sanitation! You
can't just pee anywhere!

242
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,083
Hey, buddy, this time...

243
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,999
...we'll let you off.

244
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,416
Pieces of shit...

245
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,500
Fuck you!

246
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:32,875
I'll let you off this time!

247
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,458
Hurry up!

248
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:38,165
Ay!

249
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,166
Hey.

250
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,583
Ouch.

251
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,790
Are you fucking blind?

252
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:06,874
What's the matter?

253
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:09,165
Hey, comrade. Hey, are you cold?

254
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,833
I'll close the windows.

255
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,500
Calm down. Deep breaths.

256
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,451
There's a rest area up ahead.

257
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:23,999
There'll be people.

258
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,000
You'll be alright. We'll be alright.

259
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,416
Hey, pal?

260
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:29,625
Buddy?

261
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,500
Ay.

262
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,790
I need to make a phone call.

263
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,833
Boss, fill it up.

264
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,333
Need me to fix your car?

265
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,958
No, just fill it up.

266
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:25,790
You sure? Your car ain't
looking good to me.

267
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:27,791
No repairs. Thanks.

268
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,375
How much?

269
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,250
One thousand five hundred yuan.

270
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:35,208
How much?!

271
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:37,125
One thousand five hundred yuan.

272
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,707
It's just a tank of gas.

273
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,332
Really.

274
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,000
One thousand five hundred yuan.

275
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,666
Man.

276
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,249
Don't you think that's a little overpriced?

277
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,207
There's another gas station down the road.

278
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,040
Four hundred and ten kilometers that way,
you can't miss it.

279
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:01,624
So, pal, what you're
doing here is extortion.

280
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,708
Extortion?

281
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:07,790
We don't like that word around here.

282
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:10,124
What we do is affiliated marketing.

283
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:11,791
You understand?

284
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,708
What?

285
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,165
Our rule is...

286
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:16,541
...before you buy gas,

287
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:19,040
we have a little dance show...

288
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:21,875
...that you go in there and watch,

289
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:23,416
it's pretty sexy.

290
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,540
The show is 1,200, gas is 300.

291
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,957
I'd say 300 a tank is reasonable.
Wouldn't you?

292
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:34,791
OK. Fine.

293
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,541
One thousand five hundred yuan, then.

294
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,583
But I don't need to see the show.

295
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,624
No show, no gas.

296
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:43,707
Otherwise I'd just be...

297
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,290
...ripping people off.

298
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:48,915
You get in there and have your fun.

299
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,957
You'll be smiling when you come out.

300
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,625
Right?

301
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:56,875
Just go.

302
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:58,708
Don't be surprised!

303
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,583
Ok.

304
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:05,666
I'll go in.

305
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,583
I'm going in.

306
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,250
Hey,

307
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:10,416
Zit.

308
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,000
Fill it up.

309
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,208
Come on.

310
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:36,791
Hey!

311
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,750
Hey! Hey!

312
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:40,767
Hmm.

313
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:41,249
What are you doing?

314
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:43,041
What am I doing?

315
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,000
You actually want to see the show?

316
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:50,540
Fine, then that's an extra 100.

317
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:27,958
Stop it!

318
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,500
Could you please stop it!

319
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,208
You don't need to do anything.

321
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,500
Here's 200, Ok? Take it.

322
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,125
I just came to get gas,

323
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,541
I need to go.

324
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:10,249
Come on, put on your clothes.

325
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,208
Go, go sit over there.

326
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:27,332
- Mister...
- What?

327
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Mister, y'know.

328
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:30,249
This is my first time turning tricks.

329
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:31,916
If I don't the boss beats me.

330
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:33,281
Mister, please don't arrest me.

331
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:34,456
I'm telling you the truth.

332
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:35,948
Cross my heart and hope to die.

333
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:36,790
I'm not a cop,

334
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:37,958
now get up.

335
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,875
You're not a cop?!

336
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,395
Then what the hell are you looking at?

337
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,125
I'm watching my car, Ok?

338
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:48,909
If you people didn't do this
"captive market" thing...

339
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:50,416
I wouldn't be here at all.

340
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,583
So, handsome.

341
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:01,458
Where are you going, anyway?

342
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:04,916
Home.

343
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:10,790
Did you like my dancing just now?

344
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,333
I'm telling you the truth.

345
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,500
I used to be in that...

346
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,582
...that Shanxi Art Academy.

347
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,124
Really. Do you believe me?

348
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:27,791
Look,

349
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,500
look! And look!

350
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,707
Get up!

351
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:33,999
Do you know how I got here?

352
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,499
They lied to me...

353
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:37,166
Get up, get up!

354
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,000
Mister...

355
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,791
...help me, Ok?

356
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,916
Take me with you.

357
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,124
Just help me out, Ok?

358
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,165
I'll give you 100, take it.

359
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,124
- What are you doing?
- It's my fare.

360
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:03,290
- Don't be polite, Take it.
- Why..why are you giving me money?

361
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:05,707
This is your money. This is your tip.

362
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,540
- Keep it, I can't help you.
- Don't be like this sir.

363
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,208
- Just take it!
- I can't help you!

364
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,750
I...

365
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:25,333
So what'd she say?

366
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,207
Was she an artis or a
ball player this time?

367
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:35,853
Damn little bitch you wanna run again?

368
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:37,833
You can't run with...

369
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:39,166
...broken legs!

370
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,750
You wanna run...

371
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:44,791
Hey, look, just talk to her, Ok?

372
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,333
Don't hit women.

373
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:49,207
I'll deal with you in a second!

374
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,166
Here, 1,500.

375
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:54,833
That's not enough.

376
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,207
Get this off my car, I don't want it!

377
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,333
Get off! I don't want it!

378
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:08,790
It's cold, you'll freeze
to death without glass.

379
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,249
I didn't tell you to fix my car!

380
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,415
Hey, Zit, fix the headlight too!

381
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:19,540
Hey, no!

382
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:20,708
No!

383
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:22,665
Don't fix my car,

384
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,333
don't, don't!

385
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:30,624
Fine.

386
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:31,915
Forget the headlights.

387
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,750
Three thousand yuan.

388
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,791
What a guy.

389
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:44,541
Don't leave no trace.

390
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:47,082
God bless me, God bless me.

391
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,166
Hey, boss.

392
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:04,166
Fill me up.

393
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:06,125
Here, 1500.

394
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:08,916
It's 1,500 for the gas, alright?

395
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,250
My gas line leaks, Ok?

396
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:15,583
Take it!

397
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,124
So you like her, huh?

398
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:24,666
Zit,

399
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:26,291
give him some gas!

400
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,541
A lighter.

401
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,000
One hundred yuan.

402
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:52,291
Wait a minute...

403
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,249
...you still owe me 50.

404
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:56,708
What 50?

405
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:58,291
So I don't say anything.

406
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,250
Look,

407
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:19,540
all I have.

408
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:21,541
Keep it secret.

409
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:28,749
Nobody hears about you and the girl.

410
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:30,416
I won't say a word.

411
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:36,791
Thank you. Thank you very much!

412
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:41,708
You're such a wonderful person.

413
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,166
I said I let you off,

414
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,915
and then you burned my truck.

415
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:00,833
Ah?

416
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:02,583
What's going on?

417
00:48:03,666 --> 00:48:05,290
Why the fighting?

418
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:06,582
This asshole set my truck on fire.

419
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,790
Is the gas Ok?

420
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:08,749
You burn my truck?

421
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:09,624
What's on your mind?

422
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:10,457
You want blow me up?

423
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:11,207
I got no money,

424
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,375
if I did you'd have it.

425
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:14,421
You got no money and you
burn my fucking truck!

426
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,333
Get up!

427
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:21,559
Stand up!

428
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:22,040
Straight!

429
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:23,291
Man.

430
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:23,832
It's my fault.

431
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,707
I'm sorry.

432
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:25,374
I'm sorry!

433
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:27,166
I apologize!

434
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:31,541
Sorry's not good enough.

435
00:48:32,166 --> 00:48:33,666
I'm gonna remodel your car...

436
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,583
Hey.

437
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,874
Hey what?

438
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:43,290
Hey, hey.

439
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:44,958
Hey what?

440
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:50,041
Brother.

441
00:48:50,851 --> 00:48:51,851
Let's see how far you can run!

442
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:53,207
Bro, he fucking bites.

443
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:54,375
Hurry up.

444
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:55,915
What the..., you fucking idiot?

445
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:57,583
You let him bite you?

446
00:48:57,666 --> 00:48:59,166
Go get him, that way!

447
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:01,666
Get him!

448
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:03,958
Take the bat.

449
00:49:06,809 --> 00:49:07,809
Don't run.

450
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,353
I told you, you're not going anywhere.

451
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,749
People are capable of doing anything.

452
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:38,416
When they are in extreme danger,

453
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:40,749
it's so called animal instinct.

454
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:54,708
So where are we anyway?

455
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:57,914
What happened to your face?

456
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,082
Get out!

457
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,750
Hey, hey that hurts!

458
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:01,934
Get out!

459
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:02,749
You're hurting me!

460
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:04,156
My stuff is still in the car...

461
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,666
Hey, what's the matter with you?

462
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,415
Mister, please, I'm begging you...

463
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,083
...don't leave me here.

464
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:12,666
Go home!

465
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,250
Look, I'll tell you the truth.

466
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:16,624
I'm not from the dancing academy.

467
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:18,541
My family is in Hebei.

468
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:21,665
They sold me to a trafficker for 20,000,

469
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:24,124
and then he married me to that asshole.

470
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,040
You think I'd marry him?

471
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:27,749
And he makes me work to pay him back.

472
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:29,541
You go back right now.

473
00:52:29,642 --> 00:52:30,642
I'm not lying.

474
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:32,166
Cross my heart and hope to die.

475
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:33,916
Really!

476
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,500
Go back.

477
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:58,541
Get out!

478
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:01,040
How do you expect me to go that far alone?

479
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:03,082
- Please, just get out of there.
- Can't you rescue me?

480
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,999
- Get out, then we'll talk.
- No!

481
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:08,248
- Save me, please?
- We discuss it when you get out.

482
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:09,936
Please, I can't go back that far alone.

483
00:53:26,934 --> 00:53:27,934
Open the door! Open the door!

484
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:28,457
Open the door!

485
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:30,125
Ahhh, just open it.

486
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,541
Open it!

487
00:53:53,541 --> 00:53:55,041
Mister, look...

488
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,000
I'll tell you the truth,

489
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:01,207
I do okay here,

490
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:03,374
There's no competition,

491
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,041
the boss likes me...

492
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:06,541
it's alright.

493
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,040
Alright, I won't disturb you.

494
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:09,708
I'm leaving now.

495
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:24,875
Burglary...

496
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:26,749
...for a large amount, 3-10 years.

497
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:29,708
Battery...

498
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:32,207
...if aggravate dis also 3-10 years...

499
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:33,875
...plus punitive compensation.

500
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:35,309
Bigamy...

501
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,582
...bigamy is section 258... right,

502
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,500
Two years in jail, minimum 2 years.

503
00:54:41,684 --> 00:54:42,684
I'm really a lawyer.

504
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:46,582
Do you believe me?

505
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:49,767
You don't believe me.

506
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:51,291
You don't believe me at all!

507
00:54:59,142 --> 00:55:00,142
Let me ask you something.

508
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,832
Did you smell gasoline?

509
00:55:03,517 --> 00:55:04,517
So you think...

510
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:06,041
...I poured gasoline on him?

511
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:08,017
No, no.

512
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:08,749
I didn't think that, not that...

513
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:09,582
You're lying!

514
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,750
That's what you thought!

515
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:12,125
Do you believe me?

516
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,415
Yeah, I believe you.

517
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:15,915
Don't say you believe me when you don't.

518
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:17,290
- You have to believe me, really!
- I do,

519
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:20,099
- I believe you deep down my heart.
- I really believe you, really.

520
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:32,625
Help! Help! Help!

521
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:33,791
Hey what are you doing?

522
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:34,875
Are you nuts?

523
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:35,499
Help!

524
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,165
You fucking crazy?

525
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,165
Help!

526
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,454
What the heck you are doing?

527
00:55:38,541 --> 00:55:40,082
Help!

528
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,530
Are you trying to kill yourself?

529
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,749
Don't kill me, Mister!

530
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:20,957
Are you trying to kill yourself?

531
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:23,082
Don't kill me!

532
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,874
Don't touch my money!

533
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:39,166
You monster!

534
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:40,707
Don't touch my money!

535
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:42,375
You asshole! Don't touch my money!

536
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,040
- Don't move, listen!
- Don't touch my money!

537
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:45,708
Listen to me!

538
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,750
This is my bank card,

539
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:57,416
take it.

540
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:59,166
There's 200,000 in the account,

541
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,666
the password is the account number.

542
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:04,166
I don't want it.

543
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:06,166
You can have it all.

544
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:08,125
Do you understand?

545
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:09,541
You can have all of it.

546
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:10,708
I don't want anything.

547
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:12,583
If you want the car you can take it.

548
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:13,666
I don't want anything!

549
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:15,375
Go!

550
00:57:15,642 --> 00:57:16,642
Just Go!

551
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,166
Just leave me alone, Ok?

552
00:57:18,208 --> 00:57:19,708
Just leave me alone!

553
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,707
My career comes to the end.

554
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:30,290
So is my life.

555
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:32,457
Hey, Mister. Don't be like that...

556
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,125
All the media were gonna be there...

557
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:37,665
And I was gonna make the headline news...

558
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:41,333
Now...

559
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:45,749
Ha, I guess I'll make headlines anyway.

560
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,333
What's so great about being famous?

561
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:52,316
If you weren't so worried about it,

562
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:53,540
...you wouldn't be afraid right now.

563
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:54,749
You have 200,000.

564
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:55,665
Two hundred thousand?

565
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:57,333
Doesn't do me anything.

566
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,040
In two years I've only saved 20,000.

567
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:02,415
And I know just what I'm going to do.

568
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,874
There's a little place
in Jiuquan called Anxi.

569
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:08,790
Nobody knows me there.

570
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:11,915
I'm going to rent a place in town,

571
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:13,083
install some mirrors...

572
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:15,040
...and maybe start a dancing
school or something.

573
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:16,915
Didn't you say you were from Hebei?

574
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:26,625
Listen...

575
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:28,082
In this industry...

576
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,499
...if the first thing out
of a girl's mouth is,

577
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,166
"I'll tell you the truth,"

578
00:59:31,916 --> 00:59:33,915
then the rest isn't the truth.

579
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:38,374
Just like my industry...

580
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,290
You know what, Pan Xiao,
you know what I think?

581
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:42,332
You could open a boutique store.

582
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,249
- Hire some people, rent a place...
- Go, just go!

583
00:59:44,416 --> 00:59:45,457
Or drive a taxi?

584
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:46,290
You could buy a car...

585
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:46,957
Oh good god,

586
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,207
- Pan Xiao.
- Just go!

587
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:50,495
- I told you is true.
- I need some time to think, Ok?

588
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:15,666
Hey, you're not dead!

589
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:20,457
You're not dead!

590
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,832
How could you...?

591
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,708
Ha! That's fantastic!

592
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:33,833
He's not dead,

593
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,040
...and if he's not dead I'm fine!

594
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,624
Hey buddy, you scared the crap out of me!

595
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:40,915
I mean, oh my god, you...

596
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:43,665
This whole thing is just a bad joke...

597
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:59,582
I'm not dead, what about you?

598
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,500
This guy...

599
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,333
So where is he?

600
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:17,041
One hundred.

601
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,416
He got in a fight here...

602
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:30,707
...and then took our girl away.

603
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:33,249
We're looking for him right now.

604
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:36,875
Then did you see...

605
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,000
...if he had a falcon with him?

606
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:49,166
How would I know?

607
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:55,875
Wait a minute.

608
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,790
I'll need another 50...

609
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,290
...if you want me to keep this secret.

610
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:11,874
You're a falcon dealer?

611
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:27,666
You're smart.

612
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,040
Hey, there's one more favor I need.

613
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:24,708
Open the back seat...

614
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,291
...and pull on the rope.

615
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:42,374
There's something in there I need.

616
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:55,874
Good, fantastic.

617
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,750
The falcon's Ok, anyway.

618
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:01,708
Alright,

619
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:03,583
then you...

620
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:06,957
...you have your stuff...

621
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:08,875
...and...

622
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:10,874
...and you have your car...

623
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:12,541
...park right here...

624
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:15,125
I gotta go,

625
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:17,333
take care.

626
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:24,082
Mr. Pan.

627
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:25,665
Don't be such a rush.

628
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:27,707
We still have some things to talk about.

629
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:34,041
Let me ask you something.

630
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,125
If a man

631
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:38,291
had his car broken,

632
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:41,999
and he waits by the road for help,

633
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:45,083
has that man done something wrong?

634
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:47,125
No, nothing.

635
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:51,458
Nothing?

636
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:56,124
Then why did you run into him?

637
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:58,166
His leg was broken,

638
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:00,916
blood flowed...

639
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:05,875
Ay.

640
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:07,708
Why did you do that?

641
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:10,582
I didn't do it on purpose.

642
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:13,458
He didn't do it on purpose.

643
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,458
And when you hit him,

644
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:24,061
why didn't you take him to a hospital?

645
01:05:26,416 --> 01:05:27,416
I thought...

646
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,000
...I thought you were dead.

647
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:32,666
Is that man dead?

648
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:34,625
No?

649
01:05:35,666 --> 01:05:39,332
Why did you pour gasoline on that man?

650
01:05:48,916 --> 01:05:50,624
You're a very bad man.

651
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:55,749
Do you realize that what
you've done is serious?

652
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:58,582
Do you realize how it impacts society?

653
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:09,291
OK.

654
01:06:09,916 --> 01:06:11,540
Get the tube from the car.

655
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,000
Go!

656
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:26,958
Now suck the gas out.

657
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:30,541
Why?

658
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:55,333
Pour it out.

659
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:08,166
Pour it on your head.

660
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,749
Good, good, good.

661
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:25,208
Put it down.

662
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,250
Get away from the car...

663
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:48,540
You're terrified, don't you?

664
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:50,458
How is it?

665
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:52,707
The smell isn't so good, is it?

666
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:56,875
No, it's not.

667
01:07:57,291 --> 01:07:58,791
Not good,

668
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:00,833
no good to smell.

669
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,625
I've got gas on me,

670
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,208
and my leg is hurt.

671
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:14,238
We're even, alright? We're even.

672
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,957
You're all fucked up now.

673
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:20,666
Hey,

674
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:22,458
we should get you to a hospital,

675
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:24,915
your leg doesn't look good...

676
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:26,583
before it's too late.

677
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:29,249
Oh, so you love him?

678
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:32,208
Okay,

679
01:08:32,416 --> 01:08:34,124
you wanna go with him?

680
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:45,458
Hey, slut,

681
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:48,124
feel his pocket, see if he
has a lighter in there.

682
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:01,041
Mr. Pan?

683
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:03,999
It isn't a clue,

684
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:05,832
it's proof, right?

685
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,041
Come on,

686
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:08,666
light his hair!

687
01:09:10,208 --> 01:09:11,708
Light it.

688
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:17,082
You don't want him to die?

689
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:20,499
What about you? Do you wanna die?

690
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,666
Light it!

691
01:09:34,375 --> 01:09:35,875
One...

692
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,000
Two...

693
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:00,791
Hey, there's that fucker.

694
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:17,625
Help!

695
01:10:17,708 --> 01:10:19,208
Run!

696
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:14,678
Do you know a village called ErDao Liangzi?

697
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:41,041
This won't work,

698
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,500
I told you.

699
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:48,250
He's got a gun.

700
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:52,416
Yeah?

701
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:54,083
I've got a truck,

702
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:55,708
I'm gonna hit the bastard.

703
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,500
Hey, calm down!

704
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:02,708
We should get outta here

705
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:04,750
and call the cops.

706
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:08,790
We should call the cops.

707
01:14:09,559 --> 01:14:10,559
Man, you don't know,

708
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:12,083
I'm a lawyer...

709
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:14,666
So what?

710
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:16,875
You caused all this!

711
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:18,833
You brought him out!

712
01:14:19,166 --> 01:14:20,666
My brother's dead because of you.

713
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,125
Fuck off!

714
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,000
Suddenly I realized that...

715
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:53,166
...now...

716
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:55,249
...I was that monkey.

717
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:59,249
I was placed at the dog-eat-dog world,

718
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:03,415
and you know what's more pathetic?

719
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:07,915
Nobody's under the tree looking out for me.

720
01:16:05,208 --> 01:16:06,874
Oh, I forgot about you are vegetarian.

721
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:10,125
What do you want for me?

722
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:14,291
Friends,

723
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:15,957
should help each other.

724
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:21,375
We...

725
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:23,291
...are not friends.

726
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:26,083
We are different!

727
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,457
You don't know yourself.

728
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:30,790
You write your own damn book,

729
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:32,118
I smuggle my own damn falcon,

730
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:33,832
we had the same goal.

731
01:16:34,666 --> 01:16:36,166
I believe,

732
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:38,458
we...

733
01:16:40,083 --> 01:16:41,624
...are still different.

734
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:50,833
Take it.

735
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:55,958
You could call the police.

736
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:17,333
So,

737
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:19,468
I could help you to find
something you want,

738
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:22,541
you take me our here.

739
01:17:49,059 --> 01:17:50,059
Mister...

740
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:50,790
Don't do this to me!

741
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,458
I can't drive!

742
01:18:08,666 --> 01:18:10,915
What the hell's wrong with you?

743
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:12,207
I was not meant to do it.

744
01:18:12,375 --> 01:18:13,875
Are you trying to kill me?

745
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:24,207
Yeah, you're tough...

746
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:25,875
...kidnapping my woman??

747
01:18:30,041 --> 01:18:31,541
Who the hell are you?

748
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,833
Where's the guy in the suit?

749
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,749
Who are you?

750
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:51,832
How many idiots am I gonna meet today?

751
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:55,666
Come here!

752
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:02,916
Leave me alone.

753
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:09,707
What are you doing?

754
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,290
Nice knife.

755
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:17,208
Come on, stab me.

756
01:19:18,541 --> 01:19:20,041
What's this?

757
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,000
Oh, it's a gun.

758
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:26,207
You're hardcore.

759
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:27,999
Is that a hammer?

760
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:30,332
Come here and smash my head in,

761
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,124
do it!

762
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:32,791
Come here!

763
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,583
You really are a fucking idiot!

764
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:01,874
You almost got me killed!

765
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,250
Get up!

766
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:08,874
You're playing around with guns huh?

767
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:42,540
Where were you going?

768
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:10,875
My hands hurt.

769
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:15,207
Take off my ropes, Ok?

770
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:48,291
My falcon?

771
01:22:51,041 --> 01:22:59,041
Where's my falcon?

772
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,750
His dad took it.

773
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:13,625
You know him.

774
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,500
Get in.

775
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:06,583
Don't.

776
01:25:08,041 --> 01:25:09,665
She's a girl.

777
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:11,333
Just let her go.

778
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:20,790
Friend do this thing for me, Ok?

779
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:36,750
Hello? 110?

780
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,332
I saw a hit and run...

781
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,707
...on Yanbai Road, a red car.

782
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,500
Come as fast as you can.

783
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:49,290
You! Why did you do that?

784
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,625
Friends...

785
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:54,082
...are gonna help their friends.

786
01:26:57,666 --> 01:26:59,166
I'll give you this,

787
01:27:00,458 --> 01:27:01,958
just don't kill him!

788
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:46,665
Don't take her money...

789
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:48,333
...you don't deserve it.

790
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:52,582
Give it back.

791
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:28,415
You poisoned by carbon monoxide.

792
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:30,249
Water will make you die faster.

793
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,500
What's this about?

794
01:30:45,791 --> 01:30:48,624
He took the girl.

795
01:30:48,791 --> 01:30:50,749
He's gonna kill her.

796
01:30:50,916 --> 01:30:52,416
The falcon dealer.

797
01:30:52,916 --> 01:30:56,207
I don't think he's going to let her go.

798
01:30:56,666 --> 01:30:58,166
You think?

799
01:30:58,333 --> 01:30:59,665
That's not enough, is it?

800
01:30:59,833 --> 01:31:02,540
The law demands evidence.
Do you have evidence?

801
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:07,041
Do you?

802
01:31:08,166 --> 01:31:09,666
You don't?

803
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,333
Well, I do.

804
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:17,332
I've got the suspect.

805
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:21,290
It's on maker 320 send a car.

806
01:31:36,375 --> 01:31:37,875
No, wrong way!

807
01:31:38,291 --> 01:31:39,791
U-turn.

808
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:41,708
Erdao Liangzi!

809
01:31:42,041 --> 01:31:43,374
You have to get to Erdao Liangzi!

810
01:31:43,541 --> 01:31:44,582
Or she'll die!

811
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,082
You've been poisoned.

812
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:47,415
Save your thoughts.

813
01:31:47,583 --> 01:31:48,457
Ignore the voices in your head.

814
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:50,125
Get some rest.

815
01:31:58,666 --> 01:32:00,166
I'm sorry, sir!

816
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:30,250
Wake up,

817
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,000
wake the hell up!

818
01:32:36,184 --> 01:32:37,184
Hello? Police.

819
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:38,708
Hello, I gotta report to you,

820
01:32:38,875 --> 01:32:40,375
Erdao Liangzi!

821
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:42,290
There's been a kidnapping, possible murder,

822
01:32:42,458 --> 01:32:43,698
and poaching of protected birds.

823
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:44,207
Ah?

824
01:32:44,375 --> 01:32:45,875
Ahya! God, he's a murderer!

825
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:04,165
Hey, know anybody who buys falcons?

826
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:43,582
Anyone?

827
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:00,415
Just like I told you,

828
01:37:00,583 --> 01:37:02,083
the goods are here.

829
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:07,582
When did you go from being a falcon...

830
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:09,250
...poacher to a hitman?

831
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:12,540
- Does that scare you?
- Me, afraid...

832
01:37:13,583 --> 01:37:15,957
My entire life, I go
abroad every other week.

833
01:37:16,125 --> 01:37:16,957
I had a deal in tens of millions.

834
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:19,249
But I don't kill people.

835
01:37:21,708 --> 01:37:23,208
Here's the money.

836
01:37:24,708 --> 01:37:27,124
You get it after you clean up down there.

837
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:30,250
Drag it out.

838
01:37:34,125 --> 01:37:35,249
What are you doing?

839
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:36,207
What do you think?

840
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:37,875
Well, what can I say?

841
01:37:38,666 --> 01:37:40,499
You can't keep doing this.

842
01:37:40,666 --> 01:37:41,987
Do you think you are eating buns?

843
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,500
One after the other one?

844
01:37:44,083 --> 01:37:46,207
You should stop doing it.

845
01:37:46,375 --> 01:37:47,040
Did you hear me?

846
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:47,707
Do it!

847
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:49,040
Hey, you...

848
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:50,208
Fine fine fine.

849
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:51,165
If you don't want to listen to me,

850
01:37:51,333 --> 01:37:52,415
then do whatever you want.

851
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:53,415
I say I'm abroad now.

852
01:37:53,583 --> 01:37:54,790
I didn't hear or see anything.

853
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:56,458
I don't know anything about it.

854
01:38:03,458 --> 01:38:04,958
What plans?

855
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,500
What? I'm in China.

856
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:09,290
My wife wanted me to get her something.

857
01:38:09,458 --> 01:38:10,958
Wait a bit longer.

858
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:22,750
Micheal, call the police.

859
01:38:22,916 --> 01:38:23,707
Where are you?

860
01:38:23,875 --> 01:38:25,749
There are 800 people waiting for you!

861
01:38:25,916 --> 01:38:26,499
Erdao Liangzi!

862
01:38:26,666 --> 01:38:27,082
Call the cops! Call the cops!

863
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:27,915
Erdao Liangzi!

864
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:28,707
Hurry up, call the cops!

865
01:38:28,875 --> 01:38:29,665
What police?

866
01:38:29,833 --> 01:38:31,124
Hurry it up!

867
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:32,457
Call the police!

868
01:38:32,625 --> 01:38:33,915
- You think you made a fool of me?
- I know.

869
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:35,874
- This is you, your career! Are you aware of that?
- God dammit, I know!

870
01:38:36,041 --> 01:38:38,249
- Keep the whole page on paper for me!
- Fuck, I know.

871
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:48,458
Hello?

872
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:53,665
Say something! Hello?

873
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:01,040
Can you hear me?

874
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:06,665
- Mr. Pan.
- Hello? Keep going.

875
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:08,333
Everyone is here, the media,

876
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:08,999
leaders all waiting for you.

877
01:39:09,267 --> 01:39:10,267
Then just wait.

878
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:11,791
What about the under table money?

879
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:14,499
Don't hand out a cent if I don't show.

880
01:39:14,666 --> 01:39:15,790
- Do you hear it?
- Ok.

881
01:39:15,958 --> 01:39:16,999
You tell me.

882
01:39:17,166 --> 01:39:18,666
- Are you done?
- No.

883
01:39:18,916 --> 01:39:20,040
I've got a big case to handle here.

884
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:21,750
Bye.

885
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:25,165
You dig everyone out!

886
01:39:27,208 --> 01:39:28,708
Who the hell are you?

887
01:39:30,416 --> 01:39:31,665
You could never die huh.

888
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:33,333
Shut up, listen to me.

889
01:39:33,583 --> 01:39:35,083
Think about why I released you.

890
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:36,874
I was trying to give you a second chance!

891
01:39:37,208 --> 01:39:38,957
Your sentence just got a lot harsher!

892
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:41,563
But what you did is kill more people.

893
01:39:41,583 --> 01:39:43,083
Your sentence just got a harsher!

894
01:39:43,166 --> 01:39:44,666
You stand still.

895
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:47,083
What are you doing?

896
01:39:55,666 --> 01:39:57,332
Bullshit. There's no cops.

897
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:01,290
Just you?

898
01:40:01,458 --> 01:40:02,958
And you want to stop me?

899
01:40:03,916 --> 01:40:06,124
You must think I'm an idiot...

900
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:08,416
..."divide and conquer".

901
01:40:10,791 --> 01:40:12,707
I think you forgot something.

902
01:40:17,041 --> 01:40:18,749
You are really an idiot!

903
01:40:19,916 --> 01:40:21,249
Let me tell you some truth,

904
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:22,916
cops are gonna be here in minute.

905
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,000
Get in his truck,

906
01:40:25,583 --> 01:40:27,249
and push redial on his satellite phone.

907
01:40:28,125 --> 01:40:29,625
See if they're coming or not.

908
01:40:35,333 --> 01:40:36,833
He called the cops!

909
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:39,250
Don't move!

910
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:40,999
No wonder you're so late.

911
01:40:41,166 --> 01:40:42,666
You backstabber!

912
01:40:43,375 --> 01:40:45,749
You are a idiot!

913
01:41:15,416 --> 01:41:16,916
I'll fucking kill you!

914
01:41:17,125 --> 01:41:17,749
Wait.

915
01:41:17,916 --> 01:41:18,540
What?

916
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:20,333
I need the proof!

917
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:28,250
Run.

918
01:41:30,458 --> 01:41:31,958
I'm fine.

919
01:41:36,666 --> 01:41:38,166
Run.

920
01:41:45,791 --> 01:41:47,291
Split, run!

921
01:42:08,375 --> 01:42:09,875
Get up! Come on!

922
01:42:11,166 --> 01:42:13,082
Get up!

923
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,500
What's this?

924
01:43:04,708 --> 01:43:06,208
You're a bloody wreck.

925
01:43:08,833 --> 01:43:11,040
Go. There's a first-aid kit in the truck.

926
01:43:19,458 --> 01:43:20,958
Have a cigarette!

927
01:43:22,017 --> 01:43:23,017
Smoke!

928
01:43:23,041 --> 01:43:24,541
It won't kill you!

929
01:43:27,541 --> 01:43:29,207
Don't throw lighters around anymore, Ok?

930
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:30,124
Tell you what,

931
01:43:30,291 --> 01:43:31,791
this time I'll let you...

932
01:44:31,166 --> 01:44:32,666
let her go.

933
01:44:50,416 --> 01:44:51,916
Hurry up, get out of here!

934
01:44:53,833 --> 01:44:55,333
You go first.

935
01:44:56,291 --> 01:44:57,791
Just go!

936
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:00,665
Go! Get up.

937
01:45:03,208 --> 01:45:04,708
Get the fuck up!

938
01:45:06,416 --> 01:45:07,916
I can't run anymore.

939
01:45:09,291 --> 01:45:10,791
You should run.

940
01:45:11,125 --> 01:45:13,124
Tell the world what was going on here.

941
01:45:15,291 --> 01:45:16,791
Get the fuck out!

942
01:45:38,708 --> 01:45:40,208
Why?

943
01:45:41,375 --> 01:45:43,082
You are alive,

944
01:45:43,875 --> 01:45:45,415
why you came back?

945
01:45:47,208 --> 01:45:49,499
You think you could save her by yourself?

946
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:58,540
You'll never understand.

947
01:46:00,125 --> 01:46:01,874
We have nothing in common.

948
01:46:03,083 --> 01:46:04,583
You are an animal.

949
01:46:09,416 --> 01:46:10,916
Sure.

950
01:46:12,458 --> 01:46:13,958
You are vegetarian.

951
01:46:15,333 --> 01:46:16,957
I am carnivore.

952
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,624
You should watch her die first.

953
01:46:43,583 --> 01:46:45,207
How could I not recall anything?

954
01:46:45,375 --> 01:46:47,540
What's the teacher's name?

955
01:46:48,458 --> 01:46:50,665
Let's call him "Teacher monkey".

956
01:46:51,833 --> 01:46:53,665
I still want to tell him,

957
01:46:54,416 --> 01:46:55,916
that I was absolutely right.

958
01:46:56,666 --> 01:46:59,082
The biggest difference
between a man and an animal,

959
01:46:59,833 --> 01:47:02,415
is we learned how to use fire.

960
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,374
Tomorrow I could make the headline.

961
01:49:17,333 --> 01:49:18,915
I was looking at that bird.

962
01:49:19,416 --> 01:49:21,124
Why does it fly that high,

963
01:49:21,625 --> 01:49:22,707
risking its life for...

964
01:49:23,083 --> 01:49:24,583
...a mouthful of food?

965
01:49:25,166 --> 01:49:26,874
I'm like that bird.

966
01:49:27,916 --> 01:49:29,457
Those years in no-man's land...

967
01:49:30,208 --> 01:49:31,708
...were wasted ones.

968
01:49:33,125 --> 01:49:34,749
Nobody treats me like...

969
01:49:34,958 --> 01:49:36,832
...I'm a human being, not even myself.

970
01:49:37,708 --> 01:49:39,208
That truck driver who saved me,

971
01:49:39,375 --> 01:49:40,375
looked at me on the way,

972
01:49:40,875 --> 01:49:42,375
starring,

973
01:49:42,708 --> 01:49:44,208
said nothing at all.

974
01:49:45,083 --> 01:49:46,083
I was then thinking,

975
01:49:46,583 --> 01:49:48,624
I'm gonna do something and
make people be proud.

976
01:49:55,375 --> 01:49:56,375
It's all over.

977
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:57,750
So, in the future,

978
01:49:58,125 --> 01:49:59,625
are you leaving again?

979
01:50:00,125 --> 01:50:01,625
No,

980
01:50:03,291 --> 01:50:04,791
I'm tired.

981
01:50:05,375 --> 01:50:06,457
I just want to stay here.

982
01:50:06,666 --> 01:50:07,374
To find,

983
01:50:07,541 --> 01:50:09,041
find a real job here.

984
01:50:10,625 --> 01:50:12,125
I've been gone for so long...

985
01:50:12,416 --> 01:50:13,957
I don't even have any friends left.

986
01:50:19,083 --> 01:50:21,290
- Hello, Mrs. Xing.
- Hello, class.

987
01:50:22,434 --> 01:50:23,434
I need to start class.

988
01:50:23,458 --> 01:50:24,958
You wait here, Ok?

989
01:50:25,083 --> 01:50:26,415
Get your clothes off,

990
01:50:26,583 --> 01:50:28,083
get ready.

991
01:50:28,666 --> 01:50:31,499
- What's wrong with Shi Hanyu?
- She's sick today.

992
01:50:31,666 --> 01:50:33,166
Take it easy, take it easy.

993
01:50:33,517 --> 01:50:34,517
Don't shout! Don't shout!

994
01:50:34,541 --> 01:50:34,957
Come on everybody.

995
01:50:35,166 --> 01:50:35,957
Come on now, 2nd formation.

996
01:50:36,125 --> 01:50:36,832
Let's get started,

997
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:37,624
alright?

998
01:50:37,791 --> 01:50:38,874
Everybody hold hands,

999
01:50:39,125 --> 01:50:40,125
back up a step.

1000
01:50:40,166 --> 01:50:42,082
Is everyone's arm straight? Yes?

1001
01:50:42,333 --> 01:50:44,415
- Good. Come down.
- Yes.

1002
01:50:44,583 --> 01:50:46,083
Turn right.

1003
01:50:46,642 --> 01:50:47,642
Good.

1004
01:50:47,666 --> 01:50:49,665
First hand position, get ready.

1005
01:50:49,833 --> 01:50:51,540
Get set.

1006
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:52,915
Inhale! Exhale!

1007
01:50:53,083 --> 01:50:54,624
Stretch! Stretch! Stretch!

1008
01:50:54,791 --> 01:50:55,540
Right!

1009
01:50:55,708 --> 01:50:57,208
Breath.

1010
01:50:57,833 --> 01:50:59,333
Keep it up! You two.

1011
01:50:59,541 --> 01:51:00,541
Good.

1012
01:51:00,625 --> 01:51:04,374
Two two three four,

1013
01:51:04,541 --> 01:51:08,040
five six seven eight.

1014
01:51:08,208 --> 01:51:09,208
Mind to breath.

1015
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,000
Right!

1016
01:51:11,625 --> 01:51:12,790
Open!

1017
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:13,958
Right!

1018
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:14,915
Hold your breath.

1019
01:51:15,083 --> 01:51:16,083
Put it down.

1020
01:51:16,559 --> 01:51:17,559
Come here, Maomao.

1021
01:51:17,583 --> 01:51:19,083
Show it to everyone.

1022
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:20,750
Pay attention everyone!

1023
01:51:20,875 --> 01:51:22,375
Don't forget what we just learned!

1024
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:30,791
Knees straight!

1025
01:51:31,041 --> 01:51:32,541
Fantastic!

1026
01:51:33,041 --> 01:51:35,499
Li Yuxin!

1027
01:51:36,416 --> 01:51:37,957
You studied dance after that, right?

1028
01:51:40,333 --> 01:51:42,082
Professional dance?

1029
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:55,208
No problem.

1030
01:51:55,333 --> 01:51:55,874
Come on.

1031
01:51:56,125 --> 01:51:58,457
Bring those mats over here for me.

1032
01:52:02,375 --> 01:52:03,875
What are you two doing?

1033
01:52:04,333 --> 01:52:05,833
Have you stretched your back?

1034
01:52:07,958 --> 01:52:09,707
Don't just stand there, get moving!

1035
01:52:09,875 --> 01:52:11,375
Put them on the floor.

1036
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:14,790
You'll be my assistant from now on.

1037
01:52:16,375 --> 01:52:17,875
Try to keep up, okay?

1038
01:52:19,059 --> 01:52:20,059
Children!

1039
01:52:20,083 --> 01:52:22,165
This is Mrs. Li, our new teacher.

1040
01:52:22,333 --> 01:52:23,915
Everyone say hello to Mrs. Li.

1041
01:52:24,083 --> 01:52:27,582
Hello! Mrs. Li.

1042
01:52:27,791 --> 01:52:29,291
Well, don't just stand there talking!

1043
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:30,499
Give me splits!

1044
01:52:30,958 --> 01:52:32,458
Splits!

1045
01:52:33,583 --> 01:52:35,083
You too.
