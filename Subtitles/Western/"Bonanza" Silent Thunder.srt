00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,945

Hello, Annie!

00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,314
- (sheep bleating)
- Annie!

8
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,976
Whoo!

9
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,387
(excited bleating)

10
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,334
Don't run away now.

11
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,170
Albie isn't gonna hurt you.

12
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,472
(bleating)

13
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,673
You're real purdy.

14
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:14,868
LITTLE JOE:
Albie!

15
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:19,512
Why, hello there, Little Joe.

16
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,081
Now, leave her alone, Albie.

17
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,415
You're scaring her.

18
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,085
Now, what are you doing
up here on the mountain?

19
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,653
Just on my way
to Placerville.

20
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,121
Come on, Albie,
you're hurting her.

21
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,723
Oh, I'm the only friend
she's got up here.

22
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,192
Ain't I, Annie?

23
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:36,029
Leastwise, she don't give me no
back talk like the other women.

24
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,431
She's not an animal
in one of your traps.

25
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,455
Now, let her go.

26
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,464
I ain't hurting her--
I was just saying hello.

27
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,877
Oh, you better not hurt her.

28
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,245
Not ever.

29
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,447
ALBIE:
You don't belong up here.

30
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,449
This ain't your country.

31
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,509
Best you mind your own business.

32
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,619
You bother Annie,
I'll make it my business.

33
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,195
(sheep bleating)

34
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,377
This is my country,

35
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,711
and I'm gonna see
it stays that way.

36
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,053
(theme song playing)

37
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,956

38
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,560
(bleating)

39
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,724
Come on, stop working
so hard, Sam.

40
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,858
You got company.

41
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,095
Oh. Sorry, Little Joe.

42
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,197
I got a touch of fever.

43
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,733
Figured this might...
sweat it out of me.

44
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,735
Eh, feeling any better?

45
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,837
Hey, I brought you that
gun barrel Pa said you needed.

46
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,372
And I got a little present
for Annie.

47
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,408
(chuckles) Waste of time,
bringing her anything.

48
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,604
Just... leave her be.

49
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,714
(chuckles)
Hey, Sam, look.

50
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,979
She's pretending she's a tree.

51
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,655
Foolishness.

52
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,124
Can't hear, can't talk,

53
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:22,152
don't understand no more than
them dumb beasts she tends.

54
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,032
No use bringing her presents,
Little Joe.

55
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,900
Aw, come on, Sam.

56
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,003
Anybody understands
getting a present.

57
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,138
Suit yourself.

58
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,140
Getting on towards dinner.

59
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,909
You're welcome to share it,
such as it is.

60
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,400
Thank you.

61
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,490
Look, I, uh... I brought you
a little present.

62
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,187
Hey, wait a second,
let me get it.

63
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,736
Uh... I thought I'd bring it
as long as I was coming.

64
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,227
It's not much.

65
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,976
Well, go on,
it's not gonna bite you.

66
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,968
Well, come on, take it,
it's for you.

67
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,574
Here, wait a second.

68
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,780
Here.

69
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,395
It's not much, just...
just a rag doll.

70
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:37,763
Hey... don't worry,
I'm not gonna take it back.

71
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,516
Yeah, well, you...

72
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,247
y-you go right ahead
and enjoy it.

73
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,185
So long.

74
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,494
I'll-I'll see you.

75
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,292
Yeah, so long.

76
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,431
It's good talking to you,
Little Joe.

77
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:42,101
Man gets out of the habit
with nobody around to listen.

78
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,504
Why do you stay up here, Sam?

79
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,172
It's best.

80
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,975
Yeah, maybe it's best for you,
but what about Annie?

81
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:53,045
Must be something
terrible wrong with a man

82
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,948
to father a child like her.

83
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,618
Killed her ma,
bringing her into the world.

84
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,953
I reckon it ain't
too much punishment

85
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,622
for me to raise her.

86
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,791
It was just an accident
the way she was born.

87
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,925
It's not your fault.

88
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,260
No more!

89
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,662
I won't hear no more about her.

90
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,325
Not from you, not nobody.

91
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,570
Okay, Sam.

92
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,573
I'll help you move
the rest of those sheep

93
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,042
before I start out
for Placerville.

94
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,350
- (sheep bleating)
- LITTLE JOE: Come on!

95
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,627
(Little Joe groans)

96
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,231
I never knew a couple dozen
sheep could be so ornery.

97
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,166
They're almost as bad as people.

98
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,835
You know, it's funny.

99
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,604
You know, I've been talking
to you all day, and...

100
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,564
I know you can't hear
a word I'm saying.

101
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,712
Hey, what are you
looking at now?

102
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,881
Hey...

103
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,817
that's what I call
a right pretty girl.

104
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,086
Hey, look over here.

105
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,655
That fella right there, that's
that handsome Joe Cartwright.

106
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,592
This is the guy that's always
watching me when I'm shaving.

107
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,796
I just can't seem
to get rid of him.

108
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,628
(Little Joe laughs)

109
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,298
(Little Joe laughs)

110
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,041
All right, what are you trying
to fool me with now?

111
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,034
What have you got
behind your back?

112
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,952
Yeah, that...

113
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,012
that's real beautiful.

114
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,454
That sure is pretty.

115
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:54,300
I guess you don't need to know
how to talk to say everything.

116
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,427
Thanks.

117
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,906
I-I wish I could...

118
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,875
make you understand.

119
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,378
Hey, look.

120
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,610
Look, I'm-I'm trying
to tell you I like it.

121
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,211
Thank you.

122
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,564
(dog barking in distance)

123
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,566
- Oh, howdy, Preacher.
- Albie.

124
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,401
It's good to see you again.

125
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,236
Thank you, Albie.

126
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,972
You been walking
in the way of the Lord?

127
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:36,275
Well, I-I've been doing
a lot of walking.

128
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,678
Uh, say, you were
up here near spring

129
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,880
the last time you came by here.

130
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,548
I guess it was.

131
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,550
You dropping in on Sam, too?

132
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,786
Well, you don't think
I'd be swapping tales

133
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,888
and telling news
with that Annie?

134
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,892
She's a child of God, son,
for all the way he made her.

135
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,161
Reckon that's a fact, Preacher.

136
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,596
How about you?

137
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,632
About time you married
and raised a family, isn't it?

138
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,068
Plenty of unmarried girls
in town.

139
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:06,105
Town girl once said I had
the smell of a trapper on me.

140
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,442
It's like...
meat that's not cured right.

141
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,644
You'll find the right girl
soon enough.

142
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,079
Come on, now.

143
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,515
The word of the Lord
will calm your mind...

144
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,347
and your soul.

Amen.

148
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:42,274
I'm paying for my sins,
Preacher. Paying.

149
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:46,512
You, Sam? That why you're always
getting them chills and fever?

150
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,710
Every man is tempted
by the devil, Albie.

I could bear up

Uh, even if'n
you could read, Sam,

who would you read it to?

159
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,977
Getting cramps,
sitting all this time.

179
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,701
Come on, come on.

180
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,538
I've been trapping
for over a week.

181
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,240
A man likes a woman
to be waiting when he gets back.

182
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,742
Come on.

183
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,645
Come on!

184
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,914
What are you, some sort of stick
of wood or something?

185
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,282
Come on.

186
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,217
You can't hear, you can't talk.

187
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,209
Haven't you got any feelings?

188
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,626
Now, that's not so bad now,
is it, huh?

189
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,797
PREACHER:
Albie, where are you?

190
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,766
You in there in that shed?

191
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,067
Coming, Preacher.

192
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,403
I'm not finished with you yet.

193
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,463
I'll be back.

194
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,669
(door opens)

195
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,913
What are you doing
in that shed, Albie?

196
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:11,517
Well, I'm just helping Sam catch
up with his chores, Preacher.

197
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,885
Oh, that's good of you, Albie.

198
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,553
Sam's got a lot of fever.

199
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,623
Be a good idea if you
stop around whenever you can.

200
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,258
Don't worry, Preacher.

201
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,961
I'm going to be around
a lot more now.

202
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,293
Good.

203
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,450
(coins clinking)

204
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,340
What you doing here, girl?

205
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,536
You should be out
with the sheep.

206
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,181
What are you hiding?

207
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,843
Out with it, girl.

208
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,891
I've warned you.

209
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,350
Never touch me money pouch.

210
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,034
Corrupted by a present.

211
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,703
You've done an evil thing.

212
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,298
You must be punished.

213
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,681
At least if you can't hear,

214
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,483
I know you can feel.

215
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,420
I take no joy in hurting you.

216
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,821
I'm your father.

217
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,590
It's my duty to teach you
right and wrong

218
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,821
as best I can.

219
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,393
Thou shalt not steal.

220
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,526
Thou shalt not steal.

221
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,641
Ah.

222
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,979
Don't look at me
with them sad eyes.

223
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,550
I can't stand to see suffering
written on your face

224
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,251
and not a word
coming from your tongue,

225
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,020
not even sobbing.

226
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,823
Put it back,

227
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,021
so you'll remember,
never do it again.

228
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:39,958

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,956
Hey, Sam!

232
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,948
Sam Croft!

233
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:45,697
Hey, wait till you see what
I brought you from Placerville.

234
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:46,698
Come on.

235
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,534
It's really for you anyway, Ann.

236
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,968
Wait till you see what it is.

237
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:53,072
See, I got to talking
to this doctor in Placerville

238
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,675
and I told him all about you,
and he gave me this.

239
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,244
Here, here, take it.

240
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,113
Hey, Sam!

241
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,775
Sam!

242
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,152
It's a... it's a book
of sign language,

243
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,954
a-and you can learn to talk
once you...

244
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,223
once you understand these signs.

245
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,825
It's not hard either

246
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,488
'cause I learned a whole bunch
of 'em on the way out here.

247
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,968
Yeah, sure, you-you don't even
know what I'm talking about.

248
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,164
Here, come on, come on.

249
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,943
Now, listen.

250
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,781
You can learn to talk

251
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,117
and to hear

252
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,551
just like other people.

253
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,819
(thunder cracks)

254
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:44,620
Only with these...
with your hands.

255
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,150
Well, let me see
how I'm going to do this.

256
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,234
First page.

257
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,636
Now, now, look.

258
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,272
A flower.

259
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,976
See the picture?

260
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,345
A flower, just like the picture.

00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,679
(sniffs)

262
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,281
Ah.

263
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,649
A flower, you see?

264
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,651
(sniffs)

265
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,953
Flower--this is the sign.

266
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,288
(sniffs)

267
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,656
Flower.

268
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,851
Now you do it.

269
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,529
All right, watch me once more.

270
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,863
Flower.

271
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,398
(sniffs)

272
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,267
Just like you were smelling
a real nice flower.

(chuckles)

277
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,212
Look, there's-there's nothing
in my hand.

278
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,847
I'm not trying to fool you.

279
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,549
F-Forget that.

280
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,584
We'll go-go to another one.

282
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,155
Girl.

283
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,224
You.

284
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,792
Girl.

285
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,729
Girl, 'c-c-cause your cheek's
real, real nice and soft.

286
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,565
G-Give me your hand.

287
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,100
See, just like that.

288
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,365
Girl, gi...

289
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,697
Wow.

290
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,345
Boy... boy.

00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,346
(clicks tongue)

292
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,448
Just like tipping my hat--
a boy--

293
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,450
like I tip, tip my hat.

(sniffs)

297
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:32,130
This is gonna be a lot tougher
than I thought.

298
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,565
I can't make it any plainer.

299
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,193
I don't know
why you can't understand it.

300
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,772
(sniffs)

301
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,708
That's it!

302
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,842
That's it.

303
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,071
What's this for?

304
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,480
Oh, Annie.

305
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,383
Look, this isn't
some kind of a game.

306
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,952
I'm doing my best to...
to teach you this sign language.

307
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:54,953
(thunder cracks)

308
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,789
Look, I want you
to be able to talk

309
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,658
and to understand people
when they talk to you.

310
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,150
Can't you see that?

311
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,298
No, I guess you never will.

313
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,438
You couldn't hear that.

314
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,945
Why, of course.

315
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,346
Of course, you feel it!

316
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,081
Here.

317
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,650
Here, you feel that?

318
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,318
That's what talking is.

319
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,186
Feel it.

320
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,221
Here.

321
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,356
Feel it.

322
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,859
Feel the ground.

323
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,028
Look, you can talk like that.

324

(thunder cracks)

325
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,398
Look!

(thunderclap)

327
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,629
See that? I'm talking to you
with my hands.

328
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,313
That's it!

329
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,281
That's it, you understand.

330
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:59,584
You do understand.

331
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,678
That's girl.

332
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,356
Boy.

333
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,826
Boy--tipping your hat.

334
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,828
A beautiful flower.

335
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,764
(thunder rumbling)

336
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:16,702
There isn't a person
who can talk or hear

337
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:20,672
that could ever understand
the way you feel.

338
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,197
I'm so happy.

339
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,144
It's raining.

340
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:37,489
(thunder rumbling)

341
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,481
Rain.

342
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,597
Rain, just... just like
the drops coming down.

343
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,366
Come on.

344
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,358
Let's go inside.

345
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,511
You want to learn it all?

346
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,079
All right, you will.

347
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,216
It'll take time
and it'll take work,

348
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,878
but you will.

349
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,647
(thunderclap)

350
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:17,229
You trying to tell me
that there's any hope

351
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,964
when I've lived my whole life

352
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,832
with the weight of her
pressing on me heart

353
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,434
like a stone.

354
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,202
Yeah, well, you watch, Sam.

355
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,105
You see for yourself.

356
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:31,743
Now, you are going to talk

357
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,110
to your father.

358
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,743
Understand?

359
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,977
Boy.

360
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,585
Girl.

361
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,628
Flower.

362
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,304
Book.

363
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,846
That ain't talking.

364
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,714
That's just like Indian sign.

365
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:10,715
That's right.

366
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,083
That's right, only better.

367
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,619
You're a fool, Little Joe.

368
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,855
She's just waving
her arms around.

369
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:19,724
How do you know she understands
what she's doing?

370
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,893
See for yourself,
she understands.

371
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,361
All right.

372
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:27,132
You know what them signs mean,
do you?

373
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,201
You, girl.

374
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,203
He, boy.

375
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,035
What am I?

376
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,632
What am I?

377
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,668
What am I?!

378
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:42,747
What am I?!

379
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:43,748
Stop scaring her, Sam.

380
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:44,983
I tell you, she does understand.

381
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:45,984
No.

382
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,854
No, no!

383
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,288
She's not an animal, Sam.
Help her.

384
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,157
Bring her to town
if you don't believe me.

385
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,692
Let the doctor see her.

386
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,727
SAM: No doctor can give
that poor girl

387
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:58,230
what she was robbed of at birth.

388
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,932
She'll never change.

389
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,768
She can learn to understand,
but not if you don't help her.

390
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,964
Not if you don't
give her a chance.

391
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,809
Oh.

392
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,539
Sam.

393
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,506
Look at her. She's talking
to you with her hands.

394
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,121
She's telling you

395
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,857
she went out into the rain
and got the book.

396
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,224
Now do you believe me?

397
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,663
She's not one
of your sheep, Sam.

398
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,655
She's your daughter.

399
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,259
(metal clanging)

400
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,695
Whoa. Whoa.

401
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,929
Now, you wait here.

402
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,989
I'll see if the doc's in.

403
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,637
(metal clanging)

404
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,332
MAN: Hyah!

405
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,835
Hyah!

406
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:20,238
Hyah! Hyah!

407
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,339
Ann!

408
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,508
- Hyah!
- Look out!

409
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,500
Get out of the way!

410
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,782
Oh. Ann!

411
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,342
Ann, you near got killed.

412
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:40,625
Ain't that the old coot
who lives up in the mountains?

413
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,027
Yeah. Sam Croft.

414
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,162
He only comes down
about twice a year.

415
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,731
You know, I-I thought
he lived by hisself.

416
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,466
He-He's been holding out on us.

417
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,458
Yeah. Yeah.

418
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,176
Well, Sam Croft.

419
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,346
Now where did you get a pretty
little thing like her, huh?

420
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,248
You been holding out
on us, Sam?

421
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,283
Uh, what do you want, Tom?

422
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,584
Well, you went out

423
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,921
and got yourself
a little company, huh?

424
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:12,290
She's-she's my daughter.

425
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,825
Who you trying to fool?

426
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,360
Leave us alone.

427
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,996
Has old Sam
been treating you right?

428
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,831
Hmm?

429
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,299
Well, what do you say?

430
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,701
I'm talking to you.

431
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,569
She... she don't talk
much to strangers.

432
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:25,804
Well, now how come?

433
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:28,206
Is she too good
for fellas like us, huh?

434
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,575
Yeah, let me get
a good look at her.

435
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:31,976
Now let go!
Give-give me that!

436
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,378
You want it, Sam?

437
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,146
Well, you got to come
and take it.

438
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:36,815
SAM:
Uh, uh, please, leave us alone.

439
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,249
We ain't doing you no harm.

440
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,252
Now, Sam,
if the girl wants her bonnet,

441
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,621
let her ask for it
real pretty-like, huh?

442
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:48,393
Now, I bet
I can make you talk to us.

443
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,495
No, leave her alone.

444
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,630
Leave her alone. Oh.

445
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,632
Whoa, there, Sam,
where you going?

446
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,396
LITTLE JOE:
Leave him alone!

447
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:18,590
It's only that old
mountain goat Sam Croft.

448
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,218
Get out of here.

449
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,436
Come on, Pappy.

450
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,437
(chuckles)

451
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,463
He ain't worth shooting.

452
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,968
Aw, we just having a little fun.

453
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,216
You both all right?

454
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,285
Well, we ain't hurt.

455
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,053
Good. Come on, Sam,
the doctor's in.

456
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,189
No, we ain't going to no doctor.

457
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,191
We shouldn't have come here
in the first place.

458
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,559
Shouldn't have listened to you.

459
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,694
What's the matter?
What are you talking about?

460
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:59,597
We belong in the mountains,
me and the girl both.

461
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:03,468
We ain't fit for no town
and the town ain't fit for us.

462
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,804
Sam, for once,
think of what's right for Ann.

463
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,472
That's <i>who</i> I'm thinking of.

464
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,441
Now, get out of my way.

465
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,419
How's it coming along, son?

466
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,823
You know, you've been spending
much more time up at the Crofts'

467
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,625
these past few months than here.

468
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,527
Pa, you just
wouldn't believe it.

469
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,229
Why, Ann's learned
so much already.

470
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,931
We can carry on
a regular conversation.

471
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:36,134
Uh, how's Sam Croft?

472
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,269
Still as stubborn
about it as ever?

473
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,471
That man's impossible.

474
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,608
He told me he'd never let her
see the doctor, not ever.

475
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,411
Sure hope I can get him
to change his mind.

476
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,640
Joe...

477
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:53,218
You don't think you're, uh...

478
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,253
over your head?

479
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,288
What do you mean?

480
00:30:57,288 --> 00:31:01,459
Well, sometimes it's best
not to push people too hard.

481
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,927
Leave well enough alone.

482
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,395
Why should I leave him alone?

483
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,464
He's not gonna help her.
Somebody has to.

484
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:07,632
Yeah, I know.

485
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:12,637
Sometimes helping
looks like meddling.

486
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,334
Don't worry, Pa,
I know the difference.

487
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,611
Joe, take care of yourself
up there.

488
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,312
- (door opens)
- Sure, I will, Pa.

489
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,678
(door closes)

490
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,983
Sam?

491
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,960
Sam, you in there?

492
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,017
Oh, there you are.

493
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:02,419
I was awful lonely
out on the traps.

494
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,027
What's that,
a new kind of game, huh?

495
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,861
You want me to play
a little game with you, huh?

496
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,968
I got ya!
Ol' Albie's missed you a lot

497
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,869
but he's gonna make it
all up to you.

498
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:30,840
Now, Sam, there's no need
to bring a gun up on me.

499
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,518
Get away from her.

500
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,090
And keep away!

501
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,693
I don't see you running
Joe Cartwright off of here,

502
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,262
or maybe you think
he's a better man than I am.

503
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,289
Joe Cartwright's
teaching her to talk!

504
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,304
I'll bet you
he's teaching her to talk.

505
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,975
Move or I'll blow
your head off!

506
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,777
All right.

507
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,109
All right, Sam.

508
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,018
Just remember,
with all that money

509
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,619
and all them girls in town,

510
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:12,579
Joe Cartwright ain't interested
in marrying anyone like Annie.

511
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,337
(Little Joe laughs)

512
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:31,105
All right,
this is last one for today.

513
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,442
This is going to be a tough one.

514
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,312
Love. Love.

515
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,656
Your father...

516
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:46,851
helps you.

517
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,062
Your father...

518
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:54,599
gives you food.

519
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,469
You... live...

520
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,700
in your father's house.

521
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,880
You love your father.

522
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,942
Your father loves you.

523
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,316
Uh...

524
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:24,662
Let me see.

525
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,731
I can say, uh...

526
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,499
you love flowers.

527
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:32,368
Then you'd know
that it was good.

528
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,569
I teach you to talk, yeah.

529
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:45,983
(chuckles):
No. No, no, you...

530
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:47,485
That's wrong.

531
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:51,547
See, you don't love me.

532
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,630
Now that is wrong.

533
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,395
You don't love me.

534
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:10,141
Now look, you don't love me!

535
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,406
You don't love me,
and I don't love you!

536
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,055
Oh, Annie...

537
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,650
Annie, I'm... I'm sorry.

538
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,832
Please, I...

539
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,893
I-I didn't want to hurt you.

540
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,130
Annie, please look at...

541
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,153
(dog barking in distance)

542
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,145
(chickens clucking)

543
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,671
All-all of a sudden,
for no reason,

544
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,439
she-she tried to kiss me.

545
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,608
She tried to kiss you?

546
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:53,844
She did kiss me,
as a matter of fact.

547
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:57,315
I guess she got upset,
and she ran away.

548
00:36:57,315 --> 00:37:01,047
I should have been watching you
all along.

549
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:10,016
You should have been
watching me?

550
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,765
You should have been
watching me?!

551
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,234
You should have been
helping me teach her...

552
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,936
instead of being
so stubborn!

553
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,805
Teaching her what?

554
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:24,041
Kissing? All kinds of sin?

555
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:28,946
You keep away from her.

556
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:31,582
All right, Sam.

557
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,751
All right,
I'll keep away from her.

558
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,919
You're her father.

559
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,081
You try teaching her
for a change.

560
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,172
(hoofbeats receding)

561
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,834
(sighs)

562
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:04,008
Good-bye,
Little Joe Cartwright.

563
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:17,326
Ann! Ann!

564
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,337
Hello, Sam.

565
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,039
I'm looking for Ann.

566
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:31,242
I told you I didn't like
a gun thrown on me.

567
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,077
How's it feel?

568
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,912
Where's Ann?

569
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,080
Have you got her?

570
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,782
No, I ain't got her,

571
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,048
but I will have
after you meet with an accident.

572
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,022
You see, Sam,
I'm going to be a hero.

573
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:48,857
I'm gonna take care of Annie
after you die in an accident.

574
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,228
(Sam screams)

575
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,242
So you just walked out?

576
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,578
Well, what was I supposed to do?

577
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:10,081
She completely misunderstood.

578
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,016
Oh, and then her father.

579
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,517
I go in and I try
to explain it to him,

580
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,487
and he starts... starts accusing
me of all kinds of things.

581
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,223
It's really funny, he doesn't
try to help her himself.

582
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,725
You insisted
on starting this.

583
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,793
You can't walk out
before you finish it.

584
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,428
I understand that--
I'm not a little kid.

585
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:25,996
Aren't you?

586
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,531
If you understand it
and still walk out,

587
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,799
then you're just a little kid.

588
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:29,967
Now wait a minute!

589
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,969
Don't you raise your voice
to me, boy.

590
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,097
Then don't you call me
a little kid.

591
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,042
Joe...

592
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:42,046
you opened a door
to the world for this girl.

593
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,382
You let her look out
for the first time.

594
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,318
Now, her gratitude for you
must be overwhelming,

595
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,586
to say the least.

596
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,454
All right, fine! Fine!

597
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,089
All I was trying to do
was help her.

598
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,791
You can't shove someone
into the water

599
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,993
and then not wait around
to see if they can swim.

600
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,194
She has a father!

601
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,363
No! You started it.

602
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,232
You were the one who tampered
with those two lives

603
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,666
and you can't
abandon them now.

604
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,396
Well, what do you want me to do,
marry her?!

605
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:17,147
Help me, Pa.
I don't know what to do.

606
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,184
Go back.

607
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,920
No, I can't.

608
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,656
I can't go back there
and hurt her anymore.

609
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,758
You must make her understand

610
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:33,297
that what she feels for you
is gratitude, not love.

611
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:37,701
Oh, she'll be hurt a little bit,
but she'll get over it.

612
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,870
If you don't go back,

613
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,135
she'll remain hurt forever.

614
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:49,008
I think I'll go for a ride.

615
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,008
(door opens, closes)

616
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:10,960
(weakly):
I can't hardly feel nothing.

617
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:18,209
What's to become of you, Ann?

618
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,745
I've kept you up here, hidden.

619
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:25,015
Ashamed of me own
flesh and blood.

620
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:29,520
Forgive me, daughter,
if you can.

621
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,288
I love you, Ann.

622
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:35,225
I always did.

623
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,896
(shallow breathing)

624
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,677
Well, I knew you'd be back
sooner or later.

625
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,516
You still playing games
with me?

626
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:36,920
I'm going to teach you more
than Joe Cartwright ever did.

627
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,399
You're worried about your pa?

628
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,567
Your pa ain't coming back.

629
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,834
You're gonna stay with me.

630
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:53,270
All right now, look,
now, just take it easy.

631
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:57,007
You be nice to Albie, and Albie
is gonna be nice to you.

632
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,442
I'll even buy you a new dress.

633
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,512
(Albie laughs)

634
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,662
(no audio)

635
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:36,344
(no audio)

636
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,644
(no audio)

637
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,214
(clattering)

638
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,493
Come back!
There ain't no place to go!

639
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,631
(frogs croaking)

640
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,544
(distant coyotes howling)

641
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:09,877
(panting)

642
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,784
Annie!

643
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:16,053
Annie.

644
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,822
Annie, Annie, what happened?

645
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,891
Look at me!

646
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,159
Look at me.

647
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,559
What happened?

648
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:27,231
Your father... hurt.

649
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:29,600
LITTLE JOE:
Needs help. Where?

650
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,536
He fell.

651
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,562
Stay out of this, Cartwright.

652
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:40,237
You do this to her, Albie?

653
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:44,415
What's she trying to tell you?

654
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,150
What happened to Sam?

655
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,885
What are you talking about?

656
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,720
Annie says Sam's been hurt.

657
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,922
Now, don't fool with me.

658
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,948
You know she can't talk.

659
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,359
Can't she, Albie?

660
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,393
(grunting)

661
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,971
(grunting)

662
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,188
(Little Joe cries out)

663
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,689
(blows landing)

664
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,681
(grunting)

665
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,167
(blows landing)

666
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,953
(sighs)

667
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,841
(Albie grunts)

668
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:52,142
Well, what did the doctor say?

669
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,644
Well, he said he'd be all right,

670
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,479
but he'll need a lot of care.

671
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,147
(sighs with relief)

672
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,383
Did you, uh...

673
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:02,352
Have you spoken to her yet
about...?

674
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,854
Yeah.

675
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,322
Good.

676
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,857
You'd better tell her
her father will be all right.

677
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,849
Right.

678
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:30,480
Your father...

679
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,684
be all right.

680
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:37,020
Doctor says...

681
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,854
your father be all right.

682
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:52,559
What...? What'd she say?

683
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,341
She said she'd help you

684
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,243
and take care of you.

685
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:01,974
She says she loves you
very much.

686
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,384
Joe?

687
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,052
Yeah?

688
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:14,889
What's the sign for daughter?

689
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,270
It's easy.

690
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:48,452
ANNOUNCER: <i>This has been</i>
