1
00:02:22,454 --> 00:02:27,012
Nebraska Territory,
circa 1853.

2
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,587
Come on, girls.

3
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:59,545
- Hello, Bob.
- Afternoon, Miss Cuddy.

4
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,075
Come on inside, I've got supper ready.

5
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:25,657
The pie is made out of peaches... from a can.

6
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,425
They had four of those cans.

7
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,719
I don't know who got the other three,

8
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,695
- I don't know who could afford 'em.
- It's good pie.

9
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:36,912
If it pleases you, we might
have a postprandial recital.

10
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:40,071
Okay, what?

11
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:45,970
- A bit of music.
- I like music.

12
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:54,839
♫ On the distant prairie,
where the <i>heather wild, ♫

13
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,414
<i>♫ In its quiet beauty liv'd and smiled, ♫

14
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:05,872
<i>♫ Stands a</i> little cottage,
and a creeping vine, ♫

15
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:10,544
♫ Loves around its porch to twine. ♫

16
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:16,445
<i>♫ In that peaceful dwelling
was a lovely child, ♫

17
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,120
♫ With her blue eyes
beaming soft and mild. ♫

18
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:27,820
<i>♫ And the wavy ringlets
of her flaxen hair, ♫

19
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,336
<i>♫ Floating in the summer air. ♫

20
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:38,020
♫ Fair as a lily, joyous and free, ♫

21
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:43,499
♫ Light of that prairie home was she. ♫

22
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,231
♫ Ev'ryone who knew her felt the gentle pow'r ♫

23
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:54,281
♫ Of Rosalie, "The Prairie Flower." ♫

24
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:07,339
That sure was pretty singin', Miss Cuddy.

25
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:12,999
- I got some cheese.
- Cheese?

26
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,720
Yes, Ma'am, you know I've got
a few of your sheep now.

27
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,739
I know.

28
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:21,300
Well, I made some cheese outta their milk.

29
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,919
I wonder if you'd like to have some.

30
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,610
I've got some here in my pocket.

31
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:29,619
The cheese would be a fine finish to our

32
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,255
fried chicken dinner and
peach pie this evening.

33
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,672
Well then, here it is.

34
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,915
This is fine cheese, Bob.

35
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:02,514
So why not marry?

36
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:06,175
Do what?

37
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:11,395
<i>Why not throw in together,</i>
land, animals, implement, lives,

38
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,530
the whole ball of wax?

39
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:18,812
<i>We could use my capital and</i>
know-how to improve your claim and mine.

40
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:23,712
And if the union produces children,
so much the better.

41
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,169
Looked at from any angle, it works.

42
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,815
So why not marry?

43
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:40,232
I reckon I'll go back
East to find me a wife.

44
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,925
Please, Mr. Giffen,

45
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,955
I won't take "No." for an answer.

46
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,820
Miss Cuddy...

47
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:50,382
I appreciate the offer and the supper,

48
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,092
and the concert and all...

49
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:55,425
but I cannot marry you.

50
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,665
<i>Will not.

51
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,525
Won't.

52
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,799
I ain't perfect,

53
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,442
but you are too bossy.

54
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:06,084
And too plum-damned plain.

55
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,939
There ain't no medicine for it.

56
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,330
This one here's still
breathing a little bit, Mama.

57
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:00,729
She is dead.

58
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,691
Mother is dead!
= Mor er død! =

59
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:04,225
I'll take her outside.

60
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,223
No! No! We must bury her properly!

61
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:08,968
I'll prepare her.

62
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,135
I'll take her outside
She is starting to smell.

63
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,566
No! No! No!

64
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,412
We must bury her properly!

65
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:21,893
You wished for her to die.
= Du ønskede for hende at dø. =

66
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:24,425
You hated her.
= Du hadede hende. =

67
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,165
You hate me.
= Du hader mig. =

68
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:32,561
Take her inside!
Let Go!

69
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,892
Take her inside!
Let Go!

70
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,561
Take her inside!

71
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:46,917
Ice...

72
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:48,375
Cold...

73
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,599
FROZEN!

74
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,566
Oh, my Jesus.

75
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:23,884
To what do I owe this pleasure, Reverend?

76
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,924
Springtime, Miss Cuddy.

77
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,175
Are Clydene and the kids
getting along all right?

78
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:30,467
Meaner than ever and
growing by the minute.

79
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:33,217
Put your mule up and
come on inside the house.

80
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,977
There's been some trouble amongst
the women here abouts.

81
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,465
I've heard about it.

82
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,462
It's bad.

83
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,470
Guess what I'm ordering.

84
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,204
- I couldn't.
- A Melodeon.

85
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:01,467
- You are not!
- Yep, I don't trust shipping a piano...

86
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:06,842
so, soon as I get into Loup I'm gonna
order a Mason & Hamlin Melodeon.

87
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,615
You'll have the only Melodeon in the Territory.

88
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,616
Back home I used to play
the piano by the hour.

89
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,600
I can't live without
real music much longer.

90
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:25,039
- I could help you with them dishes.
- I don't want any help with the dishes.

91
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,209
So...

92
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,547
How you gettin'
along with that Giffen boy?

93
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,850
He uses my mules when I don't need them.

94
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,850
He helps me with my corn.

95
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,140
We planted some potatoes together
and we keep the fences up.

96
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:46,861
How you getting along?

97
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:48,710
When my bulls have finished their work here,

98
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,514
I let him turn it turn up on his heifers.

99
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:51,709
Well...

100
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,856
Seems like you are getting
along<i> together all right.

101
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:54,902
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

102
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,684
Feed him a meal every now and then.

103
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,253
Like you do me.

104
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:01,291
You're a good citizen, Mary Bee.

105
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:03,779
The bed up on the
loft has fresh linen.

106
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,872
I'll take the slop out to the hogs
before you go to sleep.

107
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,629
You're gonna give me a son.

108
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:55,629
You're gonna give me a son.

109
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:44,084
Hell no!

110
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,309
This here is a God damned free country, Dowd!
Can't nobody make me do it.

111
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:53,607
Thou shalt not take the Lord's
name in vain, Vester.

112
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:57,100
- Especially not in His own house.
- I won't go, I can't.

113
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,069
Why not?

114
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:01,634
In the name of our Savior, Vester.
I ask you, why not?

115
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:04,949
<i>I can't take no time away from my crops
and I</i> got the girls to look after

116
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:07,850
and I can't afford to pay for no wagon.

117
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,382
- I ain't in on this deal.
- Then what are we gonna do about Theoline?

118
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,539
Pitch her down a hole in the outhouse.

119
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,700
You are a poor specimen of a man,
Vester Belknap!

120
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,975
- I came here for the drawing.
- Me, too.

121
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,112
Let's get it over with.

122
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,662
<i>What about Vester?</i>
I'll draw for Vester.

123
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,080
- What do you mean?
- I said I will draw for him.

124
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,974
- What did she say?
- I said, "I will draw for Vester Belknap."

125
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:38,185
Can we proceed?

126
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:44,059
This is a painful occasion for you and
your families and I grieve for you.

127
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:46,329
<i>Your wives are fine and godly women.

128
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,728
But life gave them more
than they could bear.

129
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,020
Now we all draw lots.

130
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,142
Whoever draws the black bean

131
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:58,413
will carry the women home
to where they come from.

132
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,738
<i>Shall we defer the lady?

133
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:02,892
- I'll draw last.
- I'll go first.

134
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,230
Keep your hands closed until
everybody's drawn.

135
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,183
Thor.
Miss Cuddy.

136
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,474
Put your hands in a circle here.

137
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,175
On the count of 3... 1...

138
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,787
- If that bean in my hand is black. I dunno...
- 2...

139
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,150
- Pass for it.
- 3.

140
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:24,089
<i>Does that mean</i> Vester has to go?
<i>But he said he wouldn't.

141
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:27,900
He has to, he's one of us.
I baptized him.

142
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:30,231
- I don't trust Vester.
- <i>Me neither.

143
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:36,331
It's true, Reverend,
Vester is a brute with no conscience.

144
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:39,066
- I'll go.
- You can't.

145
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:41,319
- Yes I will.
- Well, hell, a woman?

146
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,684
I can ride as well as anybody.

147
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:46,225
And handle a team and shoot.
You all know that.

148
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,042
And I can cook and care for

149
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:50,276
those women better
than any of you can.

150
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,415
Hell, she's right,
<i>she's sure as hell right!

151
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,152
<i>That's mighty kind of you, Miss Cuddy.

152
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:59,142
<i>You tell us what</i> you need,
we'll... we'll see to it.

153
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,365
- When will you leave?
- As soon as I can.

154
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:02,620
Today is May 5th.

155
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:06,262
She could be back in time to
celebrate 4th of July with us.

156
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:08,489
Reverend Dowd, we cannot allow this.

157
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:11,697
It is not a lone woman's place

158
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,370
to drive a wagon across this country.

159
00:17:13,384 --> 00:17:17,674
Much less when it carries three of
the Lord's least capable children.

160
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:20,259
Then why not go with me, Mrs. Linens,
we can do it together.

161
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,934
You too, Mrs. Polhemus,
better still.

162
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,253
No, you have husbands and family
to care for, as you should.

163
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,808
But I do not, because I live uncommonly alone.

164
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:33,347
Enough, please, be seated.

165
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,252
I'm afraid you are all are
right about Mr. Belknap,

166
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:43,316
he's untrustworthy with the
task of this gravity,

167
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,254
and we need a Homesman.

168
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,892
<i>We will do everything we can to equip and...

169
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,976
accommodate for this journey, Miss Cuddy.

170
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,132
If you gentlemen will excuse me for a minute.

171
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,979
- Come to look after your wagon?
- I did.

172
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:51,030
- My Lord, what is that?
- It's a train wagon, traded for it last year.

173
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,904
Since then it's been sittin'
out here in the snow.

174
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,386
When Svendsen and Sours come
around here wantin' a wagon,

175
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,006
I gave 'em a hell of a deal on it...
I give it to 'em.

176
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:05,778
<i>I cut the windows a little bigger,
greased it real good,

177
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,152
set some new spokes and fellows.

178
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,474
That's the just the right
thing for them women.

179
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:43,650
I put a sliding bolt on that door.

180
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:47,550
- What for?
- Lock them ladies in.

181
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:52,407
- Why would I do that?
- Stop and think about it.

182
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:54,662
Oh.

183
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,341
What's that?

184
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:03,570
You might wanna tie somethin' down.

185
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,679
Puttin' in ten of 'em.

186
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:11,880
Oh my, I'm not sure I'm ready.

187
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,979
Are you scared?

188
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,041
- A little.
<i>- Listen here, Mary Bee...

189
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:21,395
You got a passable rig, mules,

190
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:26,456
and you're as good a man
as any man<i> here abouts.

191
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:30,112
<i>And you're doing a hell of a fine thing.

192
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:35,870
So go ahead on... get to it... and do it.

193
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,344
- Does everybody know?
<i>- Yep.

194
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,109
- What are they say?
- Don't say nothin'.

195
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,514
People like to talk death and taxes.

196
00:20:51,392 --> 00:20:57,307
<i>But when it comes to "crazy",</i>
they stay hushed up.

197
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,542
Miss Cuddy!

198
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,250
Mary Bee!

199
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:37,597
Mary Bee!

200
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:38,797
Whoa!

201
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:39,102
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

202
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:42,725
I tried to catch you in town,
but you was already gone.

203
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,677
What do you want, Reverend?

204
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:45,726
To give you these,
they're letters to the women's

205
00:21:45,732 --> 00:21:49,000
closest to kin around Hebron,
Iowa and on back East.

206
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:54,017
Your journey will be long,
difficult and dangerous.

207
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:55,142
I expect it will.

208
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,446
Well, bless you woman.

209
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:59,475
Bless you and keep you, you know I believe
in you, don't you, I truly do?

210
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,700
I know it.

211
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:03,243
I'd go in your place if I could.

212
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,268
Now let us pray.

213
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:15,266
Heavenly Father, look down upon my daughter.
Bless her in this undertaking.

214
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,458
<i>Grant her thy strength,
guide her with thy grace that

215
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:19,651
she may carry home

216
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,380
We beg of Thee.

217
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,324

Amen.

<i>Send your account to Finnedy, the bastard!</i>
But this here is Bob Giffen's place.

224
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:55,481
<i>Bob Giffen has gone and abandoned this place,

C'mon!

229
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,725
- Are you are an angel?
- You're not dead.

230
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,315
Help me.
<i>Would you help me?

231
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:31,192
- For God sake?
- Suppose I do?

232
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:33,789
What would you do for me?

233
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:37,395
Anything! Anything!
As God is my witness!

234
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,549
If I cut you down, will you
do what I tell you to?

235
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:42,227
Hell, yes I will!
Swear to God!

236
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:44,293
- You swear to it?
- I swear.

237
00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:48,507
Swear to that Almighty God

238
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:53,619

I need to collect my possibles.

00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,017
- This is Bob Giffen's place.
- I never met him.

250
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:37,083
- What happened to his sheep?
- I ate 'em.

251
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:41,678
Now you've been blasted out by vigilantes
and hanged for jumping Bob's claim.

252
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,475
Hell! That's abandoned.
Now look at it.

253
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,337
He didn't abandon nothing.

254
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:47,855
He just went back East, to find himself a wife.

255
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,736
It's abandoned.

256
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:55,990
It sure is.

257
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:02,206
This is abandoned.

259
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:29,267
Unhitch and stable the mules

261
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:35,124
Your horse needs feed, too.

262
00:27:37,234 --> 00:27:40,427
Well, if you don't care to, I will,

What's this job of work you have in mind?

268
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:03,555
I would be grateful if you not
use my good chair that way.

269

My name is Cuddy,
Mary Bee Cuddy.

- Where is Mr. Cuddy?
- I'm unmarried.

271
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,463
What's the job?

272
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:17,884
Three women in this country
have lost their mind...

273
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:20,559
their husbands can't care for them properly.

274
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:24,738
You and I are gonna take them
back across the river to Iowa.

275
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,184
- The Missouri River?
- We'll leave tomorrow.

276
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:29,182
Hell, that's five God damn weeks from here!

277
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:32,710
I will not sit still for
profanity in my house.

I can see why you're single!

279
00:29:40,334 --> 00:29:43,086
I need someone who can hunt
and guide and spell me at the rains,

281

That's why I set you free.
It's your job and you're sworn to do it.

282
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,344
Three crazy women for five weeks
is a lot more than I bargained for.

283
00:29:55,667 --> 00:30:00,309
If you've lied to me, and intend
on abandoning your responsibility,

284
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,375
then you are a man of low character,

285
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,173
more, disgusting pig than honorable man.

286
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:09,017
Thank you for the kind words, Sister.

287
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,932
You're no prize yourself, you're plain
as an old tin pail and you are bossy!

288
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:17,943
But I'll sit out with you,
because I said I would.

289
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,252
And I'll help you tend your cuckoo-cuckoo
clocks as long as<i> it suits me.

00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:24,554
<i>However, I will up and</i> leave
when, where and if I please.

336
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,662
I put banknotes for $300 inside
this envelope, just for you.

337
00:35:42,884 --> 00:35:44,513
Well, why not let me have it now?

338
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:47,121
Right this minute I'm going to the
Post Office to put it in the mail.

339
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:48,613
Why not carry it along with us?

340
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,938
<i>When we get to Hebron,</i> Mrs. Carter
will have it for you.

341
00:36:09,942 --> 00:36:14,063
<i>Her boy's not very not old,
we'll have to watch him close.

342
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:16,991
I don't know what he'll do
when we take Arabella away.

343
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:53,795
Ma'am...

344
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:05,826
Well there she is, <i>my wife, Belle.

345
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:09,287
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Sours.

346
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:16,328
<i>She won't say nothin', Miss Cuddy,
she just sets</i> and looks out the window.

347
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:22,275
It's like her body's all stoved-up.

348
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:27,206
I have to carry her to the outhouse,

349
00:37:27,384 --> 00:37:30,725
undress her nights,<i> dress her in the morning.

350
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,702
How long she been like this?

351
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:34,378
Ever since...

352
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:39,983
I don't even know her no more.

353
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:44,151
How old is your wife?

354
00:37:44,351 --> 00:37:45,834
Nineteen.

355
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:49,061
- And you?
- Twenty one

356
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,109
I see.

357
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,986
My, but she was beautiful,<i> Miss Cuddy.

358
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:01,496
She may be once again.

359
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:07,084
<i>Mr. Briggs, will ya winter-up your
leisure long enough to lend a hand?</i> Now!

360
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:41,480
I wish you God's comfort, Garn.

361
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:48,009
Here... there's this, too.

362
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:52,377
<i>Her grandma's wedding gift,
I reckon</i> it should go with her.

363
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:56,325
I'll keep it for her and
see she takes it home.

364
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,342
We'll be back in a few weeks, you'll hear from
or meet the Reverend Dowd that she's safe.

365
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:10,754
Goodbye!

366
00:39:16,617 --> 00:39:18,518
Goodbye!

367
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:21,107
You don't love me?

368
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,320
You won't even look at me.

369
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:27,015
You don't give a tinker's damn.

370
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,691
Just go on home and play
with that damn doll.

371
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:33,055
<i>Leave me up against it.

372
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,749
You don't love me?

373
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:43,396
- G'bye.
- Go on, get, you can just go to hell.

374
00:39:44,328 --> 00:39:45,010
G'bye!

375
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,133
You don't love me.

376
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,361
Good morning, Mr. Svendsen.

377
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:04,662
Come in.

378
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,423
- She's ready.
- Why is she tied?

379
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:16,517
"God will strike you down",
she says to me.

380
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,348
She thinks she's God.

381
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:37,899
Her cousin will pick her up in Iowa
and take her to asylum.

382
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:39,147
Stop it!

383
00:40:41,215 --> 00:40:43,073
What a pain you are!
= ...du der. =

384
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:55,861
How will we get her loaded?

385
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:05,317
Unbolt the wagon door.

386
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,239
Stop it!
Stop it!

387
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:09,439
Stop.

388
00:41:13,642 --> 00:41:15,341
Open the wagon door!

389
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:25,385
Help me, push her in.

390
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,728
Do not untie her,
she'll try to kill you.

391
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,618
She'll try to kill her, too.
Drop out!

392
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:43,435
What are you doing with that son of a bitch?

393
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,899
- Oh, no.
- He's going with us.

394
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:48,046
<i>He's the one who tried to
take over </i>Bob Giffen's place.

395
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:50,637
I need help,
surely you understand!

396
00:41:50,837 --> 00:41:52,651
He was suppose to hang.

397
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,180
- Mr. Svendsen.
- Get down off that wagon.

398
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,447
Get down off that wagon right now,
or I will shoot you where you sit.

399
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:05,350
I can't do this alone,
I need him, now you leave us be!

400
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,823
Get us moving.

401
00:42:09,817 --> 00:42:14,022
You boys didn't have balls to hang me!
You wanted my horse to do it for you, didn't ya?

402
00:42:14,092 --> 00:42:16,263
C'mon! Let's go.

403
00:42:16,463 --> 00:42:18,230
C'mon, first, c'mon.

404
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:21,588
Keep that gun on that son of a bitch.

405
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:30,725
I'll watch over your wife, Mr. Svendsen,
I promise, she'll be safe with me.

406
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:16,971
I'm giving you my seed.

407
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:19,573
But you refuse.

408
00:43:22,209 --> 00:43:25,129
You'll receive my seed, woman.

409
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:27,788
You'll give birth to our child.

410
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,099
You girls go to your room
while I talk to your mama.

411
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:14,340
Theoline, this is Mary Bee.

412
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:16,568
- Undo!
- Undo your hands? I am.

413
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:18,720
Undo, undo.

414
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,318
<i>Undo, undo, undo.

415
00:44:21,518 --> 00:44:22,817
Do you know me, Theoline?

416
00:44:22,841 --> 00:44:24,241
Undo, undo, undo.

417
00:44:24,334 --> 00:44:28,151
Line, darling,
I am Mary Bee, your friend.

418
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,791
Don't you know me?

419
00:44:57,125 --> 00:45:01,039
Now listen, girls,
your mother's very sick.

420
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:07,303
But she loves you just the
same as she always has.

421
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:10,296
And you must love her, too, and
help as much as you can.

422
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:13,911
There are some things
I want you to do for her.

423
00:45:13,984 --> 00:45:17,213
I want you to undress her,
heat some water,

424
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:21,709
and give her a nice bath,
with soap, from face to feet.

425
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:24,630
- Right on the bed?
- Right on the bed.

426
00:45:25,334 --> 00:45:27,910
Wash and dry her hair, too,
then brush and comb it.

427
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:33,294
Then find some clean clothes for her
and underwear, and dress her again.

428
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:41,611
And while you do all this, I want you
to smile at her and say kind things.

429
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:47,388
- Do you know a little song you can sing?
- We know "Flow gently, Sweet Afton"

430
00:45:47,684 --> 00:45:49,894
That would be fine.

431
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:54,523
And when you've finished all this, I want
you to do some chores for your father, too.

432
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,489
You're now the ladies of the house.

433
00:45:58,334 --> 00:46:02,048
I want you to sweep it out,
wash the dirty dishes,

434
00:46:02,148 --> 00:46:08,005
take the bedding outdoors and air it...
show him how grown up you are.

435
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:10,924
Will you do that for him, for me?

436
00:46:12,334 --> 00:46:15,858
Now, all right, now start singing.

437
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:18,797
♫ Flow gently, sweet Afton ♫

438
00:46:18,897 --> 00:46:21,593
- Good, and remember...
- ♫ Among thy green braes ♫

439
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:24,771
- love your dear mother.
- ♫ Flow gently, I'll sing thee ♫

440
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:28,810
- Now, you get busy as bees, give me these foreheads.
- ♫ a song in thy praise ♫

441
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:35,008
<i>♫ Flow gently, I'll sing thee
a song in thy praise ♫

442
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:39,968
<i>♫ My Mary's asleep by
thy murmuring stream. ♫

443
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:46,018
<i>♫ Flow gently, sweet Afton,
disturb not her dream. ♫

444
00:46:46,459 --> 00:46:51,014
<i>♫ Thou stock-dove whose echo
resounds tho' the glen ♫

445
00:46:51,114 --> 00:46:56,323
<i>♫ Ye wild whistling
blackbirds in yon thorny den, ♫

446
00:46:56,423 --> 00:46:58,314
<i>♫ Thou green-crested lapwing... ♫

447
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,060
Mrs. Svendsen, is that you?

448
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:20,084
Please, stop wailing, Mrs. Svendsen.

449
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:26,079
Mrs. Svendsen, I asked you to stop.
Please do!

450
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:33,597
Stop!

451
00:47:33,775 --> 00:47:36,193
Mrs. Svendsen, stop!

452
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:28,872
<i>Do you think these mules'll make it
all the way to the Missouri river?

453
00:48:30,042 --> 00:48:32,355
I doubt it, not without a good feeding of corn.

454
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:36,060
The one flickin' her ears, she knows
she's the subject of our discussion.

455
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,237
She's a thinker,
the other one's a worker.

456
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,573
They should have names,
what should we name 'em?

457
00:48:41,675 --> 00:48:45,412
Mules don't need names, they need feed,
and corn's the best there is.

458
00:48:45,834 --> 00:48:49,516
I'll name that one Grace,
and that one Redemption.

459
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:52,870
My mare, her name's Dorothy, after my sister.

460
00:48:53,084 --> 00:48:56,900
She's married to a doctor up in New York state,
that's where we're from.

461
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:01,250
Dorothy has a little 6 year
old boy and a baby on the way.

462
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,454
Our mother died when we were little girls.

463
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,344
What's your horse's name?

464
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:15,109
Brown.

465
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:58,031
You didn't give me the two damned skinny
blankets, it gets cold at night out here!

466
00:49:58,131 --> 00:49:59,495
You noticed.

467
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:03,548
We need to head south-east,
follow the river bottoms.

468
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:05,130
No.

469
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,447
We'll meet more people that way
in case we need help.

470
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:11,600
Ya know, only three kinds of people out here,

471
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:14,278
you gonna meet wagon trains that
don't want to see crazy people.

472
00:50:14,334 --> 00:50:16,517
You gonna meet freighters
who will surely rape you,

473
00:50:16,612 --> 00:50:19,885
and you gonna meet Indians
who'll kill ya... and then rape you...

474
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:23,654
after they kill me!
No, we're gonna go straight east to the river.

475
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,770
We're haulin' an odd lot of freight.

476
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:27,947
They are not freight,
they are human beings.

477
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,718
- They're crazy.
- They are precious to the Lord.

478
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,588
Precious to me, too.
Give me that skillet, about $300 worth.

479
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:38,300
Wake up! Time to get moving!

480
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:44,041
Get up and go pee!

481
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:49,341
C'mon there, girl.

482
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:58,975
Watch your head on the
hub there, baby, c'mon.

483
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,562
C'mon.

484
00:51:15,334 --> 00:51:16,503
There ya go.

485
00:51:19,084 --> 00:51:20,293
Pee.

486
00:51:21,034 --> 00:51:23,010
God damn!

487
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:31,047
Squat down.
Squat down!

488
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,464
Now pee!

489
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:33,970
God... will strike you down.

490
00:56:02,584 --> 00:56:05,853
God will strike you down.

491
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:13,304
I love trees.

492
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:19,074
I don't get to see very many trees...
I miss them.

493
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:22,562
God will strike you...

494
00:56:25,084 --> 00:56:30,794
New York... has lots of trees.

495
00:57:13,666 --> 00:57:16,881
Surely you wouldn't defile and desecrate.

496
00:57:17,207 --> 00:57:21,662
You are horrible... and morbid!

497
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:32,923
I don't wanna be cold anymore
when I'm trying to sleep.

498
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:36,274
I need this buffalo hide,
and that dead Indian don't.

499
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:53,143
I was in the Dragoons.

500
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:57,033

00:58:01,334 --> 00:58:06,245
Had us a right smart scuffle one time down
there in Kansas with them God damned Kiowas!

503
00:58:07,292 --> 00:58:11,409
- Tell me.
- We were headed out to Fort Leavenworth.

504
00:58:12,084 --> 00:58:16,717
Supply train, 6 mule wagons and a herd of 300 horses.

505
00:58:17,042 --> 00:58:20,551
And we had Kiowas like flees trailing us!

506
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:25,378
War paint, sassy,
big as life and twice as natural.

507
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:30,444
- Wanted them horses.
- I see.

508
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,879
<i>Well, we camped down on the
Arkansas</i> River one night,

509
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:38,312
and them teamsters picketed 36 mules and

510
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:41,388
they picketed 300 horses in the sand.

511
00:58:41,588 --> 00:58:46,730
Sand, hell, them picket pens wouldn't
hold a prairie dog in that sand.

512
00:58:47,542 --> 00:58:51,081
Sure enough, that night,
Kiowas come through there

513
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:54,892
and stampeded the whole
bunch and away they went.

514
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:58,767
<i>Trampled the wagons all to pieces,

515
00:58:58,792 --> 00:59:01,222
<i>got the stock all tangled up in the ropes,

516
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:03,608
and crippled-up with the flying picket fence,

517
00:59:03,693 --> 00:59:07,740
and them Kiowas just running through
there hooping and hollerin'.

518
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:11,158
My, oh, my, wasn't we riled?

519
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:16,893
We blew the bugle... boots and saddles and
away went after 'em with the sun risin'.

520
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,717
We caught Kiowas here and we caught Kiowas there,

521
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,515
and we caught 'em in bunches and
killed every one of 'em.

522
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:25,817
We rounded up our stock and
drove it right through the

523
00:59:25,824 --> 00:59:29,180
middle of the God damned
Kiowa camp... tore it all to hell.

524
00:59:33,584 --> 00:59:38,554
Pretty fair job of work...
Company C 1st U.S. Dragoon!

525
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,162
Well, how interesting.

526
00:59:46,475 --> 00:59:52,069
♫ I don't want none o' your weevily wheat,
I don't want none o' your barley. ♫

527
00:59:52,169 --> 00:59:56,984
♫ I'll take some flour and half an hour
and bake a cake for Charley. ♫

528
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:05,221
♫ The higher up the cherry tree,
The sweeter grows the cherry. ♫

529
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:10,384
♫ The more you hug and kiss a gal
The more she'll want to marry. ♫

530
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:17,072
♫ Charlie, he's a fine young boy
Charlie, he's a dandy. ♫

531
01:00:17,425 --> 01:00:23,294
♫ Every time he goes town
He'll bring the gal some candy. ♫

532
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,940
<i>- What are they?
- Pawnee, probably.

533
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,821
- What was that?
- Bugle.

534
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:49,630
Somewhere along the line they
killed themselves a U.S. cavalry bugler.

535
01:00:54,292 --> 01:00:56,620
- What do they want?
- Whatever we got.

536
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,661
The trouble is they don't know what that is...
<i>they've never seen a wagon like this.

537
01:01:00,761 --> 01:01:06,480
<i>Could be goods inside,</i> soldiers,
anything to them, hell, they don't know.

538
01:01:08,334 --> 01:01:10,324
I count four rifles amongst 'em.

539
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:20,316
If they think we're worth
the trouble, we're dead.

540
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:24,434
I'll try to buy 'em off.

541
01:01:33,917 --> 01:01:36,767
<i>Something happens to me, they</i>
come all the way down here,

542
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:38,654
don't you fool with that carbine.

543
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:40,620
You get in the wagon <i>quick as you can,

544
01:01:40,649 --> 01:01:44,120
you shoot the women in the
head, then shoot yourself.

545
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:47,330
You got four good rounds.

546
01:02:15,617 --> 01:02:17,228
C'mon, turn around here.

547
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,548
C'mon, turn around here.
Get outta here!

548
01:02:36,959 --> 01:02:41,651
- What will they do with Dorothy?
- They'll probably eat her.

549
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:34,511
No! No!

550
01:03:45,467 --> 01:03:47,072
What the hell?

551
01:04:00,584 --> 01:04:05,358
<i>She's gone, Mr. Briggs!</i> Mr. Briggs, she's gone.
She's<i> gone, we have to get her back!

552
01:04:05,484 --> 01:04:09,788
- Cuddy, it was a God dammed horse.
- Get up, you lout.

553
01:04:25,759 --> 01:04:28,840
She hasn't taken a step by herself
since we put her on the wagon.

554
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,689
<i>Hells Bells.

555
01:04:33,034 --> 01:04:35,239
That gal done run off.

556
01:04:52,459 --> 01:04:53,959
- Morning!
- Morning!

557
01:04:55,334 --> 01:04:56,880
Where you from, friend?

558
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:59,675
Freight train,
camped down south a little ways.

559
01:05:00,317 --> 01:05:03,253
- Big, eh?
- Thirty wagons, six yolk.

560
01:05:03,353 --> 01:05:05,767
Two weeks ago outta Fall City
headed for Salt Lake.

561
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:10,307
- You the driver?
- I am, out hunting' meat, you seen any?

562
01:05:10,384 --> 01:05:13,332
No not today, I'm out looking
for this young lady here.

563
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:17,903
- She's lost.
- She ain't now.

564
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:22,948
Friend, I got a frame wagon back there,

565
01:05:23,075 --> 01:05:26,436
I'm carrying three crazy
women to a church in Iowa

566
01:05:26,642 --> 01:05:29,899
so they can go home back East.

567
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,701
This young girl is one of 'em.

568
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:35,538
She's married, her name is Sours.

569
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:39,337
She had three little children,
and lost 'em all

570
01:05:39,437 --> 01:05:43,566
to the diphtheria... in short order
and she lost her mind.

571
01:05:44,584 --> 01:05:46,672
She run away from us last night.

572
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:50,663
- I'm her friend.
- So am I.

573
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:53,611
So you wouldn't wanna
her not to waste you here.

574
01:05:53,811 --> 01:05:56,149
She can spread her legs, can't she?

575
01:05:58,759 --> 01:06:02,526
I can tell you what,
why don't we leave it to her.

576
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,158
See here sweet thing,
who'd you rather go with, him or me?

577
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:12,548
Well, there you be, she caught
me stunned me already.

578
01:06:12,709 --> 01:06:16,712
- Friend, I'm taking this girl home.
- Not likely, she's mine now.

579
01:06:17,292 --> 01:06:22,072
Possession is nine points of the law,
and it's all of us out here now, ain't it?

580
01:06:22,134 --> 01:06:26,674
- Sorry, I'll just have to have her.
- God Almighty!

581
01:06:29,667 --> 01:06:30,865
Fight you for her.

582
01:06:31,065 --> 01:06:33,093
Best man takes the prize, how's that?

583
01:06:33,193 --> 01:06:35,292
- I'm agreeable.
- All right.

584
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,523
When I say "Pitch",
we pitch these guns, how's that?

585
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:41,077
Anytime.

586
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:43,750
Pitch!

587
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:48,532
God Almighty!

588
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:54,192
- Say it again and act right this time.
- Pitch!

589
01:08:13,059 --> 01:08:14,945
Goodbye.

590
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:17,567
Did you have to take an eternity?

591
01:08:19,084 --> 01:08:20,707
She's nearly froze to death.

592
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:25,184
You lost one horse, Cuddy,
here's you another one.

593
01:08:25,209 --> 01:08:28,059
- Who did you get this horse?
- Man let us have him.

594
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:31,374
- Why would he do that?
- Because he was dead, Mrs. Sours shot him.

595
01:08:57,834 --> 01:09:02,525
<i>- Who would do such a thing?</i>
- Indians... for the clothes.

596
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:25,259
Wolves.

597
01:09:38,334 --> 01:09:42,453
"Cissy Hahn, eleven years, two months, nine days."

598
01:09:42,842 --> 01:09:45,953
"God loved her and took her home onto Him."

599
01:09:46,425 --> 01:09:48,339
Let's go, Cuddy.

600
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,913
I intend to tidy up this grave.

601
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:54,267
- <i>Getting late.</i>
- I don't care.

602
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:56,458
Well, suit yourself, I'm goin' home.

603
01:09:57,417 --> 01:09:59,730
Then, I'll take a horse
and join you later.

604
01:10:00,084 --> 01:10:01,554
Not mine you won't.

605
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,864
You'll have to ride that train horse.

606
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:11,018
I want a shovel, too.

607
01:10:32,075 --> 01:10:34,899
Oh, Sweet Merciful Father,

608
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:39,044
Prince Jesus,

609
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:41,041
Good Shepherd,

610
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,495
Harvester of righteousnesses,

611
01:10:45,417 --> 01:10:48,017
take thee this token
and bury them deep,

612
01:10:49,709 --> 01:10:54,462
carry in...carry in,
in love let us sleep.

613
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:57,362
Send me summons to wed Thee one day.

614
01:10:59,167 --> 01:11:04,756
Love us, and love me, Oh, love me, I pray.

615
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,663
Amen.

616
01:14:38,334 --> 01:14:43,423
Why, why, why did you
light a fire for me?

617
01:14:58,334 --> 01:15:00,255
What about supper?

618
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:07,048
I did light a fire for you, Cuddy.

619
01:15:10,292 --> 01:15:11,857
Where's that shovel?

620
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:19,550
I lost the goddamn shovel!
Who cares about a shovel?

621
01:15:21,209 --> 01:15:25,747
- You... are... insane!
- The hell I am, Cuddy.

622
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:30,725
I'm tryin' to move a load to the river
quick as I can and draw that $300.

623
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,438
And that's all there is!

624
01:15:33,959 --> 01:15:35,925
There ain't no more.

625
01:16:15,292 --> 01:16:17,608
<i>♫ If I should prosper, ♫

626
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:20,627

- I couldn't sleep.
- I could.

633
01:17:21,584 --> 01:17:23,782
How long now 'til we get there?

634
01:17:26,367 --> 01:17:32,230
A week... thereabouts, maybe a month, hell, I don't know.

635
01:17:33,917 --> 01:17:38,267
It's almost over now. We stay in
Iowa or come back to the territory?

636
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:39,244
I don't know.

637
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:44,562
- You're not much for makin' plans.
- No, not much.

638
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:50,458
Mr. Briggs, you're an intelligent man.

639
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:55,406
<i>And if you think on it,
I'm</i> sure you will see the wisdom in it.

640
01:17:55,506 --> 01:17:57,813
After we've turned
them over to Mrs. Carter,

641
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:01,537
why don't we marry and
come back together?

642
01:18:03,042 --> 01:18:06,809
<i>I'm 31 years old, if I'm
ever to marry, it better be soon, and

643
01:18:06,834 --> 01:18:08,603
<i>you're not getting any younger.

644
01:18:09,292 --> 01:18:11,469
You've seen my house and my stock.

645
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:14,630
I've got two fine claims
and money in the bank...

646
01:18:15,167 --> 01:18:18,583
I'm in good health and
capable of child bearing...

647
01:18:19,334 --> 01:18:23,010
<i>I plan to buy shoats next spring
and</i> fatten 'em on corn...

648
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:26,982
and come summer I'll
have 60 acres into wheat.

649
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:31,545
I plan to put in pumpkins, too.

650
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:35,677
We'd make a good team you and I.

651
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:39,938
If we pull together, we're bound
to prosper, don't you agree?

652
01:18:40,542 --> 01:18:45,072
- No, I ain't no farmer.
<i>- Well you could try...</i> you could try.

653
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:48,213
<i>I tried it one time with a
widow woman up</i> north of Wamego.

654
01:18:48,492 --> 01:18:52,600
Up and down them God dammed
rows daylight 'til dark.

655
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:54,983
There's prettier things to look at
than the ass end of an Ox.

656
01:18:54,992 --> 01:18:57,402
One morning I just rode off.

657
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:00,776
You deserted her.

658
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:03,997
When I left I was sorry,
but I never did<i> look back.

659
01:19:04,142 --> 01:19:05,958
I see.

660
01:19:06,334 --> 01:19:08,443
So you won't marry me?

661
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:15,533
- No, I won't.
- I know, I'm plain as an old tin pail.

662
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:20,105
But would you think about it from here to
Hebron and talk with me about it again?

663
01:19:20,792 --> 01:19:22,493
Talk's cheap.

664
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:27,263
Mr. Briggs, perhaps you don't
realize what a grand thing

665
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:30,292
you're doing taking these
poor helpless women home.

666
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:34,377
If you don't, I assure you the
good Lord does and I do.

667
01:19:35,159 --> 01:19:38,769
This might be the finest,
most generous act of your life.

668
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:41,625
It might be $300.

669
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:48,222
- You won't marry me?
- No.

670
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:52,912
Then I am plain.

671
01:19:54,959 --> 01:19:57,110
I wish you'd say
one kind word to me.

672
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:57,889
<i>Like what?

673
01:19:57,984 --> 01:20:00,725
That I'm a good woman,
<i>that I've helped you.

674
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:04,233
Fair enough, you're a damn good woman,
Cuddy, and you've helped me.

675
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:16,230
I deserted from the Dragoons.

676
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:24,186
That's right, Company C 1st U.S.,
Fort Kearney, stoled a horse and away I run.

677
01:20:26,459 --> 01:20:28,395
I ain't attached to nothin',

678
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:31,905
Just me.

679
01:20:52,005 --> 01:20:53,175
No.

680
01:20:53,675 --> 01:20:58,015
- I want to lie with you.
<i>- No.

681
01:20:59,042 --> 01:21:03,899
-You must, I saved your life.
- No.

682
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:18,407
Please, spare me my dignity, Sir.

683
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:02,194
Raise your knees.

684
01:22:06,959 --> 01:22:08,881
Take me in your hand.

685
01:22:12,209 --> 01:22:14,704
Just you remember Cuddy,
I didn't force you.

686
01:22:15,417 --> 01:22:16,995
- I will.
- If I hurt you,

687
01:22:17,052 --> 01:22:18,919
- I can't help it.
- I know.

688
01:22:19,792 --> 01:22:22,611
- You asked me, I didn't ask you.
- I know.

689
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:27,331
- So let me in you.
- Yes.

690
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,176
Cuddy?

691
01:23:16,242 --> 01:23:17,626
Cuddy!

692
01:24:22,459 --> 01:24:26,338
My God in Heaven, Cuddy, we made a deal
to carry these women back to Iowa,

693
01:24:26,538 --> 01:24:29,726
and I kept my word and here
you done and broke yours.

694
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:55,392
See here? You see what you've done?
You killed her.

695
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:57,594
Look at her! You killed her!

696
01:24:58,242 --> 01:25:01,603
You're too damned crazy to pay attention
to anything, you God damned lunatics!

697
01:25:02,584 --> 01:25:04,829
You don't know nothing about this world.

698
01:25:06,209 --> 01:25:07,842
Can't even piss straight.

699
01:25:11,334 --> 01:25:13,579
Hadn't been for you,
Mary Bee wouldn't be dead.

700
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:18,107
She wouldn't even be out here!

701
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:24,001
If you hadn't gone crazy,
she wouldn't've made this trip.

702
01:25:24,201 --> 01:25:27,892
If you'd stayed steady and
strong, she'd be alive,

703
01:25:27,917 --> 01:25:30,241
and at home,
in her own house.

704
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:33,442
And so would you, but no,
you went crazy...

705
01:25:33,642 --> 01:25:37,277
and drove her crazy and it killed her,
what do you got to say about that?

706
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:42,364
Da.

707
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:18,249
Well, I'll be.

708
01:26:39,959 --> 01:26:41,913
I'm goin' on by myself.

709
01:26:43,792 --> 01:26:45,999
<i>You're on your own.

710
01:26:46,792 --> 01:26:50,717
Far enough along near East where
somebody'll come along and tend to you.

711
01:26:53,034 --> 01:26:57,192
There ain't a damn one of ya
can understand a word I'm saying.

712
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:40,620
Oh, my God.

713
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:07,572
How do?

714
01:30:07,834 --> 01:30:11,222
Been carryin' three women outside, hadn't
had anything to eat for three days.

715
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:14,150
They need supper now, rooms for
the night and a hot baths.

716
01:30:14,275 --> 01:30:16,125
We're fill up.

717
01:30:18,459 --> 01:30:21,645
- With what?
- People.

718
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:26,999
Mister I didn't come in here
for trouble, but I am tired.

719
01:30:27,834 --> 01:30:29,722
When I'm tired I'm easy to aggravate.

720
01:30:29,959 --> 01:30:32,583
Now this is a hotel, I've got money,

721
01:30:32,875 --> 01:30:35,698
I want supper now, then I
want a room for myself,

722
01:30:35,898 --> 01:30:37,418
<i>then I want the room for three women,

723
01:30:37,451 --> 01:30:40,466
<i>and I want four</i> baths
or the reason why not.

724
01:30:41,459 --> 01:30:43,046
Wait here a minute.

725
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:06,084
- Greetings!
- How do?

726
01:31:07,467 --> 01:31:09,331
My name is Aloysius Duffy,

727
01:31:09,353 --> 01:31:11,648
- and yours is?
- Briggs.

728
01:31:11,748 --> 01:31:15,267
I understand you're in need of a meal
and accommodations, Mr. Briggs.

729
01:31:15,292 --> 01:31:18,028
That's right, for myself
and 3 passengers, women.

730
01:31:18,137 --> 01:31:22,015
Oh, what an unusual cargo, I must say.

731
01:31:22,367 --> 01:31:26,305
In any case, Mr. Briggs,
I regret I cannot oblige you.

732
01:31:26,505 --> 01:31:30,574
- Why not, this is a hotel, ain't it?
- Have a drink on the house.

733
01:31:37,417 --> 01:31:38,557
Grant.

734
01:31:42,292 --> 01:31:43,244
There she went.

735
01:31:44,584 --> 01:31:48,746
Now then, Mr. Briggs, you couldn'ta
shown up at a more inauspicious time.

736
01:31:48,805 --> 01:31:56,036
It so happens a party of 16 potential investors
is coming from St. Louis by steamboat and coach.

737
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:59,444
I trust you recognize, we cannot
accommodate anyone else.

738
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:05,503
<i>These are gentlemen of means and the fate of
our</i> entire venture may very well depend on...

739
01:32:05,534 --> 01:32:09,755
We had a bad winter,
traveled a long way to get here.

740
01:32:09,967 --> 01:32:12,651
And they ain't had
nothin' to eat for 3 days.

741
01:32:14,417 --> 01:32:15,502
I'm sorry.

742
01:32:15,702 --> 01:32:21,453
The women are in bad shape,
they're... awful hungry.

743
01:32:24,084 --> 01:32:25,614
Let me see them.

744
01:32:46,825 --> 01:32:48,436
Good God.

745
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:52,869
- You can't turn us away.
- I can't.

746
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:08,335
Mr. Briggs, those women
are pitiful, I concede.

747
01:33:08,467 --> 01:33:13,230
But we can't have 'em here tonight,
<i>the milk of human kindness be damned.

748
01:33:13,709 --> 01:33:18,059
Now, kindly, be out the door and
take that wagon away from here.

749
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:20,060
And God speed to ya.

750
01:33:21,109 --> 01:33:24,287
<i>The shoe's on the other</i> foot now,
you put them guns down on the floor

751
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:28,858
real careful and get us our<i> supper
on the table right</i> God damned now.

752
01:33:31,742 --> 01:33:34,706
Shoe's back where it belongs, Mr. Briggs.

753
01:33:36,625 --> 01:33:38,999
Grant, well done.

754
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:41,139
Be on your way, my friend.

755
01:33:41,284 --> 01:33:44,809
And lament your neglect
at my offering a whiskey.

756
01:33:44,834 --> 01:33:46,791
Why? And I'll tell you why...

757
01:33:46,850 --> 01:33:50,883
you are the worst bunch of lyin', thievin',
pissant sons of bitches I'll ever run into.

758
01:33:52,959 --> 01:33:56,628
You turn your back on these poor women you'll
answer for it for the rest of your lives.

759
01:33:57,467 --> 01:34:01,934
You won't sleep,<i> you'll choke on
your whiskey and on your water.

760
01:34:02,417 --> 01:34:07,913
The food you eat will block up your bowels,
you'll die of your own shit.

761
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:10,459
<i>Your mothers and your sisters,

762
01:34:10,559 --> 01:34:15,834
and your wives and your daughters
will curse your broke dicks old.

763
01:34:17,667 --> 01:34:25,228
Get on! Get on! Hyah! Hyah!
Get on! Get on! Get! Go on!

764
01:34:27,241 --> 01:34:28,802
<i>Get on! Get on! Get on!

765
01:34:31,209 --> 01:34:32,829
Oh, for God's sake.
<i>Come on! Come on!

766
01:34:33,529 --> 01:34:34,542
Come on! Jaw!

767
01:34:37,656 --> 01:34:39,899
<i>Get on there, mule! Go on!

768
01:34:41,699 --> 01:34:42,941
Get on!

769
01:34:48,348 --> 01:34:49,648
<i>Get on!

770
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:15,207
I'm gonna go get us somethin' to eat.

771
01:35:15,792 --> 01:35:20,013
Now you all be good girls and go to sleep,
I'll be back directly.

772
01:36:08,459 --> 01:36:10,203
You need to get on outta here.

773
01:36:20,167 --> 01:36:21,623
Don't look back, daughter.

774
01:36:53,542 --> 01:36:54,835
Son of a bitch!

775
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:58,976
God damn that hurts!

776
01:37:03,917 --> 01:37:05,700
Ah, shite!

777
01:40:01,334 --> 01:40:03,729
She looks ridiculous, with...

778
01:40:05,334 --> 01:40:08,190
Pardon, Ma'am, I'm looking
for a woman by the name of Altha Carter,

779
01:40:08,284 --> 01:40:10,139
do you know where her house is at?

780
01:40:10,542 --> 01:40:13,705
- That would be the Minister's wife?
- Yes, Ma'am, that's right, it would be.

781
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:16,218
Go on down to the Methodist church.

782
01:40:16,318 --> 01:40:19,412
The house across the street,
<i>that's the parsonage.

783
01:40:20,459 --> 01:40:23,040
All right, Ma'am, thank you.

784
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,883
Come, Maisy, don't look at him.

785
01:41:20,625 --> 01:41:21,125
Sir?

786
01:41:23,334 --> 01:41:27,568
Afternoon, Ma'am, are you Mrs. Altha Carter,
the wife of the Methodist Minister?

787
01:41:27,668 --> 01:41:30,926
- I am.
- Well, Ma'am, my name is Briggs.

788
01:41:31,026 --> 01:41:35,601
I'm from the Territories, Loup,
and I've brought you 3 women.

789
01:41:36,442 --> 01:41:37,777
Women?

790
01:41:39,949 --> 01:41:41,394
Oh.

791
01:41:42,267 --> 01:41:45,380
Oh, for goodness sakes, yes!

792
01:41:47,034 --> 01:41:49,731
You have been a long
time coming, Mr. Briggs,

793
01:41:49,931 --> 01:41:51,648
I am relieved you're here.

794
01:41:51,748 --> 01:41:54,065
I'm... I'm sorry Reverend Carter isn't.

795
01:41:54,184 --> 01:41:57,860
He is out burying a beloved
member of our congregation.

796
01:41:59,667 --> 01:42:03,648
Just a minute, I thought a woman
named Cuddy was bringing them.

797
01:42:03,748 --> 01:42:05,562
That's what Reverend Dowd wrote.

798
01:42:05,792 --> 01:42:07,934
She was with us up to a week ago, Ma'am.

799
01:42:07,959 --> 01:42:10,943
I'm sorry to tell you
that a fever took her.

800
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:14,079
<i>I buried her and we moved on.

801
01:42:14,842 --> 01:42:18,579
Mary Bee Cuddy... was her name.

802
01:42:21,342 --> 01:42:24,560
Oh, what a... terrible loss.

803
01:42:24,759 --> 01:42:27,612
She must have been a fine,
brave<i> human being.

804
01:42:27,917 --> 01:42:29,876
She truly was.

805
01:42:32,042 --> 01:42:35,878
They've ridden all this way...
in that box?

806
01:42:37,725 --> 01:42:39,180
Oh, Mercy!

807
01:42:42,708 --> 01:42:45,739
Well...it's time to meet them.

808
01:42:48,292 --> 01:42:49,906
I'm not sure I'm ready.

809
01:42:58,406 --> 01:42:59,381
Get over there.

810
01:43:14,259 --> 01:43:18,647
- You must have had an awful winter.
- We did, Ma'am.

811
01:43:43,434 --> 01:43:46,290
Put them on the settee, Mr. Briggs.

812
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,833
- Do they speak?
- No.

813
01:44:05,125 --> 01:44:09,170
- Do they understand anything?
- Ma'am, I don't know.

814
01:44:13,625 --> 01:44:17,232
I noticed their eyes move 'round
the room, what does that mean?

815
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,728
That's hard to tell.

816
01:44:22,084 --> 01:44:27,914
Perhaps each remembers
a parlor... from her own past.

817
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:30,433
<i>Poor, poor dears.

818
01:44:31,709 --> 01:44:34,794
Have you noticed any
improvement in their condition?

819
01:44:34,894 --> 01:44:37,859
They don't scrap with each other
and try to run off anymore.

820
01:44:38,792 --> 01:44:40,166
Tell me their names.

821
01:44:40,484 --> 01:44:43,169
- This Theoline Belknap, she killed her baby.
- Oh, no, no, no!

822
01:44:43,542 --> 01:44:47,302
Please don't tell me, Mr. Briggs,
I don't care to know.

823
01:44:48,167 --> 01:44:51,167
That one there is a Norski woman
<i>by the name Gro Svendsen.

824
01:44:51,625 --> 01:44:54,767
- Very well.
- And that's Arabella Sours.

825
01:44:54,792 --> 01:44:57,588
<i>She's only a girl, why,</i>
she even have a doll.

826
01:44:57,592 --> 01:45:01,330
She had 3 little children, lost 'em
all to the diphtheria in 3 days.

827
01:45:01,842 --> 01:45:05,659
Dear Lord!
Please don't say anymore.

828
01:45:07,409 --> 01:45:12,645
There's letters on all 3 of 'em in this
bag here, about their kin folks and all.

829
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:15,371
I better move on.

830
01:45:17,292 --> 01:45:20,273
They might just jump
up and try t'follow me.

831
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:23,698
I think this room will hold them.

832
01:45:24,425 --> 01:45:26,679
Oh! I almost forgot.

833
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:34,672
This is for you, Miss Sours.

834
01:45:35,792 --> 01:45:37,446
It's lovely.

835
01:45:37,917 --> 01:45:42,930
Maybe you'll want it...
one fine day.

836
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:53,859
Well, goodbye, ladies.

837
01:45:56,742 --> 01:45:58,490
God bless you.

838
01:46:15,917 --> 01:46:19,029
They'll be all right.
I want to say goodbye to you.

839
01:46:19,417 --> 01:46:21,373
You can give this wagon and those mules

840
01:46:21,967 --> 01:46:24,771
and that plaid horse and everything
else to the Methodist Women.

841
01:46:24,971 --> 01:46:29,700
Maybe they can sell everything, use the money
to pay for railroad fare and whatever else.

842
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:36,575
Mr. Briggs! I'm delighted!
How very generous of you.

843
01:46:36,584 --> 01:46:39,645
Tell the Reverend to give
those mules a good feeding of corn.

844
01:46:39,875 --> 01:46:42,742
- Will you go back to the Territory?
- I don't know.

845
01:46:42,959 --> 01:46:46,993
If you do, please thank Reverend
Dowd for me and wish him well.

846
01:46:47,093 --> 01:46:48,962
Yes, Ma'am.

847
01:46:49,584 --> 01:46:54,379
Well then... this is our goodbye,
Mr. Briggs, give me your hand.

848
01:46:55,834 --> 01:47:00,006
God Our Father, bless this
good man, wherever he may go.

849
01:47:00,106 --> 01:47:01,558
Keep watch over him.

850
01:47:01,917 --> 01:47:04,287
Cause thy face to shine upon him,

851
01:47:04,375 --> 01:47:07,233
and bring him home to Thee one day.

852
01:47:07,875 --> 01:47:10,144
In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

853
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:15,519
I hope we meet again, Mr. Briggs, goodbye.

854
01:47:17,959 --> 01:47:19,631
You can go on now.

855
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:10,731
Oh, yes, Sir.
Looks better, Sir.

856
01:48:33,575 --> 01:48:36,659
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

857
01:48:37,209 --> 01:48:39,371
You ain't got no shoes or nothin' on your feet.

858
01:48:39,992 --> 01:48:42,397
Well, that's my business ain't it?

859
01:49:01,234 --> 01:49:03,824
I'll take them shoes, right there.

860
01:49:39,850 --> 01:49:43,243
You're playing high stakes, Sir,
can you show $50?

861
01:49:43,342 --> 01:49:46,063
There's $300... for ya.

862
01:49:46,875 --> 01:49:49,564
- Mind if I have a look?
- Suit yourself.

863
01:49:55,709 --> 01:49:57,623
Have a look at this, Mr. Carmichael.

864
01:50:07,209 --> 01:50:10,381
Bank of Loup, up near Wamego.

865
01:50:10,584 --> 01:50:12,444
How long since you've been there, Sir?

866
01:50:12,644 --> 01:50:14,141
Five... six weeks.

867
01:50:14,375 --> 01:50:15,854
Bank of Loup went bust.

868
01:50:16,054 --> 01:50:19,880
Happens all the time to
sod-buster banks in the Territory.

869
01:50:20,375 --> 01:50:23,965
I've lost more than my fair
share of this wild-cat paper.

870
01:50:24,792 --> 01:50:26,629
You have any greenbacks?

871
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:29,703
No, I spent it all.

872
01:50:30,459 --> 01:50:34,170
I'm sorry, Sir, I cannot
accept these banknotes.

873
01:50:34,370 --> 01:50:36,418
Nobody around here will.

874
01:50:37,042 --> 01:50:39,737
Sorry, but you can't sit at the
table unless you're playin'.

875
01:50:40,042 --> 01:50:42,994
- I have to ask you to leave.
- What?

876
01:50:44,625 --> 01:50:46,593
Please leave the table, Sir.

877
01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:53,328
You are not socially acceptable here, see?

878
01:51:11,167 --> 01:51:13,818
You ever know a woman by
the name Mary Bee Cuddy?

879
01:51:14,625 --> 01:51:15,789
No, Sir.

880
01:51:16,542 --> 01:51:17,766
These are for you.

881
01:51:27,167 --> 01:51:28,563
You still gotta pay your bill.

882
01:51:28,592 --> 01:51:32,376
That gravy and them biscuits you
made was pretty good.

883
01:51:32,459 --> 01:51:33,613
Thank you.

884
01:51:34,167 --> 01:51:36,442
I gotta good piece of advice for you.

885
01:51:38,417 --> 01:51:41,031
When you get grown,
don't marry some shitty old kid

886
01:51:41,131 --> 01:51:44,364
headed West to make a claim
on a farm he ain't built yet.

887
01:51:44,464 --> 01:51:47,740
Don't do that, you stay here.

888
01:51:47,790 --> 01:51:51,258
- Why?
- Because I told you to.

889
01:51:51,834 --> 01:51:55,031
- Who is Mary Bee Cuddy?
- Mary Bee Cuddy...

890
01:51:56,542 --> 01:51:59,096
was just a fine a woman as ever walked.

891
01:52:02,042 --> 01:52:05,716
- You'll never know her.
- Well, then, so what?

892
01:52:05,916 --> 01:52:07,250
So what?

893
01:52:10,084 --> 01:52:16,942
You are the living, breathing reason
she will never be lost.

894
01:52:18,875 --> 01:52:22,001
That's "what", darlin'.

895
01:52:22,542 --> 01:52:25,808
- You're a strange man.
- Well, I expect I am.

896
01:52:28,042 --> 01:52:29,866
Why don't we marry?

897
01:52:31,917 --> 01:52:34,151
Maybe.

898
01:53:07,634 --> 01:53:09,094
Haul away!

899
01:53:32,656 --> 01:53:34,458
<i>Pull up them shorelines!

900
01:53:44,698 --> 01:53:47,480
<i>- Yeah, I'm good when your are.
- Shove off!

901
01:53:53,530 --> 01:53:55,584
<i>Hang on, by the left.

902
01:53:57,065 --> 01:53:59,632
<i>- Hang on, walk it down, walk it down.
- I got it.

903
01:54:01,897 --> 01:54:04,811
<i>- All right, we're movin'.
- I see... take it down, boys, take it down.

904
01:54:05,664 --> 01:54:07,852
<i>- Let 'er catch up.
- Lead it out.

906
01:54:22,125 --> 01:54:25,301

01:54:31,965 --> 01:54:33,295

We are headed West, God damn it!

915
01:55:05,075 --> 01:55:08,306
You've been hiring them
