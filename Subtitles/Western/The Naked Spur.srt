1
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:40,440
Don't move.

2
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,741
Turn around.

3
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:52,719
Keep your
hands wide.

4
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:05,333
You want
something from me, mister?

5
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:07,602
Sure came up
quiet.

6
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:10,138
Got to give
you credit.

7
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,374
My name's tate.

8
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,843
Guess that don't
mean much to you...

9
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:15,645
or anyone else, huh?

10
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:17,413
This here's
pokey.

11
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:20,014
You fixing to
meet somebody?

12
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:22,484
Meet somebody?
Who?

13
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:25,388
Wouldn't mind
if i did.

14
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:27,423
Wouldn't care
who he was

15
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:29,493
or where
he comes from or what he does.

16
00:02:29,494 --> 00:02:32,495
A man ought to always
mind his own business, i say.

17
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:38,034
Looks like
you're the one expecting company.

18
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:40,371
How long
you been here?

19
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:42,273
Been poking around
these hills

20
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:43,842
three or four
weeks now.

21
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:45,577
Got no calendar
to know exact.

22
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:48,312
Got nothing
to show for it either.

23
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:50,750
If you're ready
to talk some,

24
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:52,852
i'd appreciate
your putting that gun down.

25
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:54,953
You might
get bee stung or something,

26
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:57,489
but i'd be
just as dead.

27
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:04,597
Got some breakfast
coffee boiling.

28
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:06,767
You want some?

29
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:06,934
No.

30
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,937
Uh, tobacco?

31
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:16,409
This party you're
asking after,

32
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:17,912
friend of yours?

33
00:03:17,913 --> 00:03:20,380
He killed
a marshal.

34
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:29,959
Kansas?

35
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,260
You've come a ways.

36
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:34,563
It ain't every
peace officer

37
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:35,531
who'd do that.

38
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:38,366
I ain't seen kansas
since before the war,

39
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:41,369
so i wouldn't know
you to look at.

40
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:44,372
My name's tate,
like i said.

41
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:46,676
Jesse tate.

42
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:47,476
Howard kemp.

43
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,412
You figure he's
back in these hills, mr. Kemp?

44
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:53,449
I lost his trail
this side of the river.

45
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:55,652
Did you see
any sign?

46
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:58,520
Hmm. Ran across
a dead fire the other day.

47
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:00,992
Where?

48
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:02,860
Back in there.

49
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:05,462
Got no map to
tell you sure.

50
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:07,798
You can tell me
better than that.

51
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,401
Maybe, if we
was going the same way,

52
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:11,469
but we ain't.

53
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,638
You got your job,
mister, and i got mine.

54
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,540
Helping you
don't put no money in my pocket.

55
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,010
I got
$20 here.

56
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:19,178
$20?

57
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:23,581
$20. it's yours
if you get me on a fresh trail.

58
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:24,150
$20, i...

59
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:25,651
10 now...

60
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,120
10 now, 10 when
we find him.

61
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:32,156
Start out by showing
me that dead fire.

62
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,128
Does this fella know
you're after him?

63
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:36,663
He knows.

64
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:38,999
Then he might be
waiting behind some rock,

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,934
waiting for us
to ride up in front of his gun.

66
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,804
Uh-huh.
He might.

67
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:05,327
It was still
warm yesterday.

68
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:06,962
Horses moved
out this way.

69
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:08,897
More than one
for sure.

70
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:10,299
This fellow
got company?

71
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,401
Could be packing
an extra horse.

72
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:15,271
But there might be
two of them waiting for us, huh?

73
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:16,940
That's why
you held a gun on me.

74
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,074
Come on.
Let's go, come on.

75
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:20,909
Trail's as plain
for you as it is for me.

76
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:39,297
Another fire.

77
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,598
They ain't making
much time.

78
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:42,300
Must be
something wrong with them.

79
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,536
Looks like
a horse fell there.

80
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:44,770
Yeah...

81
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,978
well, it's
no use guessing.

82
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:53,146
Ahh.

83
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:18,373
Look out!
Ride!

84
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:18,574
Ride!

85
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:27,448
Well, i guess that's
the end of it.

86
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,117
Yeah, if it was
a natural slide.

87
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:10,930
[Gunshot]

88
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,036
Look out!

89
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,537
Look out!

[Horse whinnies]

91
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,146
[Rocks crashing]

92
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,829
Well, you
found him.

93
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,564
Yeah. He got
to come down sometime.

94
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:46,901
Yeah,
but when?

95
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:47,969
A day, a week,
and the chance is

96
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,737
he sneaks down
some night and gets us.

97
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:51,706
We'll take
turn on watch.

98
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:54,342
Having it out
with this fellow ain't my job,

99
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:56,110
not for no $20.

100
00:07:56,111 --> 00:07:57,044
You've got him,

101
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:58,846
but he got you,
too.

102
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:01,615
Unless there's
another way up there.

103
00:08:03,186 --> 00:08:05,688
You're crazy.
You can't get up there.

104
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:07,055
Go up the trail
and get some cover,

105
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:08,957
and take a shot
at him every once in a while.

106
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,260
Make him think we're
stuck down here.

107
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:11,528
Ain't we?

108
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:16,232
[Hoofbeats]

109
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:16,500
Come on.

[Kemp]
Hold it!

111
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:29,647
What's
the trouble?

112
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:29,914
Get down.

113
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:34,785
I heard
some shooting

114
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:35,886
and came
to look.

115
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:38,188
Who are you?

116
00:08:38,357 --> 00:08:40,591
Oh, that's
the way it is.

117
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:42,660

extraordinary.

119
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:46,331
You're a long way
from an army post, lieutenant.

120
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:48,334
I quit
playing soldier last week.

121
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:51,034
Uh-huh. Let's see
your discharge.

122
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:53,605
What's wrong
with that?

123
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:56,642
Nothing. Except
the bozeman trail runs east from ellis.

124
00:08:56,643 --> 00:08:58,845
How come you're
this far off it?

125
00:08:58,846 --> 00:08:59,345
Well, you see,

126
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:01,547
there's some bad-
tempered indians along the bozeman trail.

127
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:04,150
Seems this
chief's daughter fell into some trouble

128
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:06,519
with a handsome,
young army lieutenant and...

129
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,054
well, you know
how it is.

130
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:20,434
The army never did
understand me.

131
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:20,635
Yeah.

132
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,071
Hey, uh,
how about these?

133
00:09:24,072 --> 00:09:26,774
All right,
give him back his gun.

Come on.

135
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:30,279
Oh, you never
did tell me

136
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,147
what the shooting
was about.

137

You don't say.

141
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:41,557
We got an outlaw killer
trapped up there,

142
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:44,526
starting rockslides
every time we show our heads.

143
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:47,796
An outlaw killer
throwing rocks?

144
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:50,166
That sounds
real desperate.

145
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:50,401

all the way from kansas?

149
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:09,352
He did.
I joined up with him this morning,

sort of helping out,
like a deputy.

a real interesting problem in tactics, sheriff.

you want here?

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,958
Man gets set
for trouble head-on,

183
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,961
and it sneaks up
behind him every time.

184
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,465
That's life.

185
00:14:59,466 --> 00:14:59,699
Get up.

186
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:09,941
Open your gun belt
and let it fall.

187
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:12,646
No need to fuss
there, soldier.

188
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:15,447
I been out of
cartridges since abilene.

189
00:15:17,218 --> 00:15:19,519
You can see.

190
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:22,622
Now, why don't you
just do what i say?

191
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,368
Hey, you two!

192
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:34,803
It's all over!

193
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:37,138
Get him, ben!

194
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:37,873
[Gunshot]

195
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,011
Ha ha ha
ha ha!

196
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:03,501
Oh!

197
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,647
Ha ha ha
ha ha!

198
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,001
All right, ben.
Tie him up!

199
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,437
Let me go! Let me alone!
Let me alone!

200
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:41,440
Calm down, sweetheart,
we're not going to hang you.

201
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:45,511
I ain't fightin'
you no more, howie.

202
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,414
Not the three
of you, i ain't.

203
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:49,484
Who's she?

204
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:54,220
You remember
old frank patch, don't you, howie?

205
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:56,991
This here's
his daughter, lina.

206
00:16:56,992 --> 00:16:58,493
I remember
an outlaw name of patch

207
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:00,762
lying dead
in front of a bank in abilene.

208
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:03,563
I don't remember
any talk about kinfolk.

209
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:05,100
He was
my father.

210
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:06,535
What's she
doing here with you?

211
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:09,304
I guess she don't
know nobody but me.

212
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:12,307
And i didn't figure on
seeing kansas again,

213
00:17:12,943 --> 00:17:14,911
till now i didn't.

214
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,279
All right.
Get up.

215
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,981
Come on,
get up!

216
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:18,948
Here you are,
tate.

217
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:21,718
That settles us.
I'm much obliged to you.

218
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:21,952
Thanks.

219
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:23,820
Say, mr. Kemp,

220
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:25,355
now you got
two of them to handle,

221
00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:27,691
maybe you're still
of a mind to hire up help.

222
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:29,960
This is my job.
I'll do it.

223
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,261
Make you feel
any better, sheriff,

224
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:34,063
you could make
me deputy. Official-like.

225
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,165
You ain't
letting on

226
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,069
like you was a sheriff
or something, are you, howie?

227
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,637
Why, sure he is.
Ain't he?

228
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:43,141
He told me he was
a peace officer.

229
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:44,375
I don't know why
you should do that.

230
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:47,277
No matter who gets me,
the reward still holds.

231
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:48,947
How's that?

232
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:50,749
Ain't you showed them
my picture, howie?

233
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,851
I seen a paper
saying you was wanted.

234
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:54,053
Nothing about
no reward.

235
00:17:54,054 --> 00:17:56,888
Maybe he ain't got
a good copy like i have.

236
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:05,964
Is that what he showed you?

237
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,567
How much?

238
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:07,835
Says $5,000.

239
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,736
Why, you talk
like you knowed it all along.

240
00:18:10,772 --> 00:18:12,072
Why else
would a man

241
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:14,741
tear off
the bottom of a poster?

242
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:17,578
I'm taking him back,

243
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:19,213
and i'm going
to do it alone.

244
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:20,614
You didn't
catch him alone.

245
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:23,683
You was going
round and round until you run into me.

246
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,720
You were hired to do
a job, and you were paid for it.

247
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,623
You ain't
gonna buy

248
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:30,625
my claim in this
for no $20.

249
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:31,493
What about him?

250
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:34,129
He done
the climbing, didn't he?

251
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,065
Could've gotten
killed, too.

252
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:37,966
Tell you what.

253
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,501
I'll settle
for a third.

254
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:41,871
How about you,
jesse?

255
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:43,273
Share and
share alike?

256
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:45,007
That's the way
it is,

257
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:47,776
unless you're of
a mind to kill us all.

258
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:53,048
Looks like you
got yourself a couple of partners, howie.

259
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:55,485
Aw, quit acting like
we was friends, you...

260
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:58,554
maybe we sat down
at the same card game once or twice,

261
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:02,758
but that don't mean
dirt to me now.

262
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:04,695
You shot a man in a back,

263
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:06,798
and i'm taking you in
to hang for it.

264
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,133
It
wasn't ben that killed that man.

265
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:11,436
It's him they're
paying the reward on.

266
00:19:11,437 --> 00:19:12,937
Now, where are
your horses?

267
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:13,771
Back of
the rocks.

268
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:16,874
Lina's horse got
a belly full of disease. He can't travel.

269
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,777
He can't,
eh?

270
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:20,278
All right.
Come on, let's go.

271
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:20,513
Come on.

272
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:29,288
Easy, boy.
Easy.

273
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:31,689
Easy there,
boy.

274
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:35,595
All right, watch him.

275
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:37,996
Easy, boy,
easy.

276
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,900
He's really
sick, mister.

277
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:42,769
That's why we
held up here.

278
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,305
Must of took
bad water someplace.

279
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:46,373
I rode him two days
like this

280
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:49,275
when he should've
rested and throwed it off.

281
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:52,245
Easy, boy, easy.

282
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,953
What are you
gonna do, mister?

283
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:02,055
That horse is suffering.
He can't hardly breathe.

284
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:07,163
You've seen
sicker horses than this,

285
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,497
ain't you,
mister?

286
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,498
He's pretty bad,
girlie.

287
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,700
No sense in shooting
a good horse just to hang me a day sooner.

288
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,770
You keep out
of this.

289
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:17,206
Besides, if we aimed
for the big river before the rains,

290
00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:20,176
it's another week
downstream to find a crossing.

291
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,313
Nobody's going
to touch my horse.

292
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:23,614
Nobody is.

293
00:20:24,548 --> 00:20:25,448
Come on, girlie,

294
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:26,516
you don't want
to leave him

295
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,919
for some cat
or bear to rip open.

296
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,488
No! No, i'm not
gonna go!

297
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:32,557
Let me.

298
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:36,526
There's no reward
for killing my horse!

299
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:41,332
Ben, don't let him
kill my horse!

300
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,734
Don't let him
kill my horse!

301
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:43,868
Listen to me!
Listen to me!

302
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,870
That horse
wouldn't have lasted the night anyway.

303
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,306
Forget about him,

304
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:51,142
and worry about
me swinging from a rope.

305
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:54,947
I need time.
You understand, lina?

306
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:55,148
Time.

307
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:56,949
And you got
to help me.

308
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,051
I've already scratched
open a sore spot over that reward.

309
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:02,121
The longer
we ride,

310
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:04,424
the more things
that can happen.

311
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:05,959
That's the fight.

312
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,160
Are you listening?

313
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:07,428
[Gunshot]

314
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:10,429
Listen to me!

315
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,737
I heard you,
ben.

316
00:21:16,738 --> 00:21:19,039
I heard you.

317
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:25,111
All right,
come on.

318
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,210
Move, you flop-eared
cactus-eater.

319
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,043
Quit dragging
your feet.

320
00:21:54,044 --> 00:21:56,878
Pokey don't like
it no more than you do.

321
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,519
Honey, first thing
i'm going to get you

322
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,453
out of that
reward money

323
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,355
is the biggest steak
in kansas for that cheek.

324
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,457
Aw, you're not gonna
be mad at me all the way, are you?

325
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,693
Come on, i'll
make it up to you.

326
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,363
What are you
doing tonight?

327
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:18,370
You're having quite
a time, aren't you?

328
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,639
Aw, come on,
loosen up. Spring is here.

329
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,608
It's going to be
a long, lonely ride to abilene,

330
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:25,911
and being as
jesse's too old,

331
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,346
i'll toss you
for her.

332
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,214
Right now she's
probably telling ben

333
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:31,451
how to cut
your throat.

334
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:34,453
You don't think
that pretty little thing would...

335
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,722
hey, you two!
Break it up there!

336
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:55,944
Arrgh.

337
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:16,465
Here, try it
with this.

338
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,467
Come on,
don't be stubborn.

339
00:23:18,468 --> 00:23:20,203
Press it against
your face.

340
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:21,337
Get away
from me!

341
00:23:21,338 --> 00:23:22,573
Like it better
this way?

342
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:25,107
Let me go!
Let me alone!

343
00:23:27,111 --> 00:23:29,279
If she bothers you
so much,

344
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,948
why don't you
tie her up

345
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:31,883
and be done
with it?

346
00:23:31,884 --> 00:23:34,151
No bother.
I like to wrestle with her.

347
00:23:34,152 --> 00:23:37,120
You're a big man
for beating up women, ain't you?

348
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:39,591
And you're
no better.

349
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:39,791
Lina.

350
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:52,336
That jackass started
a misery in my back.

351
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:55,273
Can you do me?

352
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:00,679
Don't get them fired up
all the time.

353
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,514
Best thing on our side
is your pretty face.

354
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:06,985
They're men, honey,
and you ain't. Remember that.

355
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:07,820
I'm not going to...

356
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,589
i ain't asking you
to marry them.

357
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,924
The more they look
at you,

358
00:24:10,925 --> 00:24:13,592
the less they'll
be seeing of me.

359
00:24:15,396 --> 00:24:15,563
Ahh!

360
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,798
You sure got her
trained, ben.

361
00:24:19,468 --> 00:24:20,668
I'll tell you,

362
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,336
if i was to have
a daughter,

363
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,305
i wouldn't want
her no different than lina here.

364
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:27,809
Except she shouldn't
have such sharp nails.

365
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,078
Maybe not so
much temper.

366
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,279
Hold still!

367
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,514
Honey,
you remember

368
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,182
those cigars
i got put away?

369
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:36,085
I could do
with one now.

370
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:36,319
Get two.

371
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:39,887
I don't smoke.

372
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:43,925
Any more at home
like her?

373
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:47,295
She got no home,
that's the trouble.

374
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:49,766
Ma died in 'paso
couple months ago.

375
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,935
And she come
up north hunting her pa.

376
00:24:51,936 --> 00:24:53,736
He was dead
and planted

377
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:54,370
when she
got here.

378
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:57,339
So of course
you felt obliged to look out for her.

379
00:24:57,542 --> 00:25:00,209
Son, her pa was
my best friend.

380
00:25:09,554 --> 00:25:10,054
Hey, jesse!

381
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:12,889
Why don't you
get a pan and do it right?

382
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:15,360
What do you
know about gold?

383
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:16,528
Just what
i heard.

384
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:17,362
Come on,
let's get riding.

385
00:25:17,363 --> 00:25:19,932
What's
the crazy hurry? We can camp here.

386
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:20,933
That's right,
howie.

387
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:23,135
A day more or less
won't change the price on me.

388
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:26,170
'Course, it might give
one of you boys time to think.

389
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:28,874
Plain arithmetic.

390
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,776
Money splits better two ways
instead of three.

391
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,425
Come on!

392
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:05,346
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!

393
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:39,584
How can you breathe
that stinking rope?

394
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:42,352
Kills the taste of
your cooking, jesse.

395
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:45,322
Nothing like
a good woman to stir a pot.

396
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:48,327
Nothing like
a good woman.

397
00:26:48,328 --> 00:26:50,629
I guess you got
the years

398
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,331
to know better than
any of us, jesse.

399
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:54,333
Did you ever marry
one of them?

400
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:57,001
Never had to
with my good looks.

401
00:26:58,438 --> 00:27:00,907
No sense in asking roy
here about women.

402
00:27:00,908 --> 00:27:02,942
He'd keep us
up all night.

403
00:27:02,943 --> 00:27:05,710
Well, right now i'm sort
of in-between.

404
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:10,515
Well, looks like we're
a herd of bachelors,

405
00:27:11,018 --> 00:27:11,285
even kemp.

406
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:14,488
Never should have
marched off to war, howie.

407
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:17,390
Should have stayed home
and married the girl.

408
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:19,160
'Course, none of
my business.

409
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:21,728
That's right.
It's none of your business.

410
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:23,497
Come on, let's
get this stuff cleaned up.

411
00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:26,199
All right, girlie.
Grab a handful.

412
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:28,169
I'll do mine
and ben's.

413
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,304
You'll do what
i tell you,

414
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:31,606
that's what
you'll do.

415
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:31,807
Women!

416
00:27:35,544 --> 00:27:38,345
I think
i'll go along to protect her.

417
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:45,788
Sure works
on me,

418
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,390
the way his eyes
hang on her.

419
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:51,426
Fancy-talking
eastern boy.

420
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:53,362
Trouble is, talk's
just the beginning

421
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:55,031
with wild kids
like that... you watch.

422
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:57,834
When he's ready,
he'll reach out and take,

423
00:27:57,835 --> 00:28:00,336
and who's
to stop him?

424
00:28:02,373 --> 00:28:02,540
Ahh.

425
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:09,012
Did you think
i was going to jump you?

426
00:28:09,281 --> 00:28:10,715
That's right.

427
00:28:10,716 --> 00:28:13,350
No, no. I was
just uncramping.

428
00:28:16,155 --> 00:28:18,657
You look almost sorry
i didn't.

429
00:28:18,658 --> 00:28:20,993
Yeah, killing me
in self-defense

430
00:28:20,994 --> 00:28:23,828
is a lot better than
killing me for money.

431
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:26,632
Well,
it's your choice, ben.

432
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:29,300
A bullet right here
on the trail

433
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,938
or a rope in abilene.

434
00:28:31,939 --> 00:28:34,840
Choosing a way to die...
what's the difference?

435
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:37,910
Choosing a way to live,

436
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:39,546
that's the hard part.

437
00:28:39,547 --> 00:28:42,381
That's what's eating you,
ain't it, howie?

438
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,051
There's nothing
eating me.

439
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:46,786
Somebody was bound
to collect on you.

440
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:47,856
Maybe.

441
00:28:48,623 --> 00:28:51,158
I calculated some
horse-thieving scum

442
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:53,826
would want
the price on my hide,

443
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:55,930
but not you, howie.

444
00:28:55,931 --> 00:28:57,598
Oh, why don't you
shut up?

445
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,534
Not a man of your leanings,
not a ranching man.

446
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:02,671
I don't deny
you got a dirty deal,

447
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:05,506
but... ah... the things a gal
can do to a man.

448
00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:11,746
Aw, shut up!

449
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,938
Hold it up here!

450
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,342
Might save a day
if we went over instead of around.

451
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,378
A day might make
the difference.

452
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,316
Better take
a look first to find some kind of trail.

453
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:46,883
Wait, i got
some glasses.

454
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:55,794
I knew you had your nuggets
hid somewhere under me.

455
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:58,030
I wouldn't be
putting up with you

456
00:29:58,031 --> 00:29:59,765
if i had nuggets
to take back.

457

Funny you ain't had
no luck in this country.

459

Fella i know struck gold
just north of here,

00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:10,877
half a mountain of it
almost.

461
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:12,879
What fella was that?

462
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,614
Fella i know.

463
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:16,317
Only thing,
he had more trouble getting it out of the ground

464
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:19,185
than he had finding it,
that's what i hear.

465
00:30:19,888 --> 00:30:21,489
He don't know much.

466
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,090
Got them from
an officer fella.

467
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:25,860
Swapped them even
for a fayute tomahawk.

468
00:30:25,861 --> 00:30:28,662
Weren't really fayute,
i made it myself.

469
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:28,930
Ha ha ha!

470
00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:32,666

for a horse trader.

and stand a while?

to look ahead?

Oh, that man could do that
with his own life.

479
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:11,241
Maybe if i'd seen
what was ahead when i was younger,

480
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:15,846
i wouldn't be in this fix.

481
00:31:15,882 --> 00:31:18,348
Ah, of course i would.

nope.

Nope. I wouldn't have done
nothing no different.

485

dragged you with me.

drag me, ben.

and think,

reach out and take.

things are,

a trail.

and finish them off when they come through.

531
00:33:39,135 --> 00:33:41,602
Why look for
trouble?

532
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,708
What's the matter,
lieutenant?

533
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:48,177
All right,
if you want to know, they're after me.

534
00:33:48,178 --> 00:33:51,180
They've been hunting me
ever since i left the fort.

535
00:33:54,786 --> 00:33:56,186
This
chief's daughter

536
00:33:56,187 --> 00:33:58,455
you was
holding hands with,

537
00:33:58,456 --> 00:33:59,456
was she willing?

538
00:33:59,457 --> 00:34:02,159
Never mind the sermon.
We've got a fight on our hands.

539
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,595
This is
# your fight, not ours.

540
00:34:04,596 --> 00:34:06,497
You expect me
to take them alone?

541
00:34:06,498 --> 00:34:08,032
They don't just
kill a man.

542
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:08,766
He's right.

543
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:10,968
Them indians are out
to revenge a squaw,

544
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:12,771
they'll make him holler
first.

545
00:34:12,772 --> 00:34:15,340
Do the same thing to us
if we're with him.

546
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:16,608
Maybe worse.

547
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:19,843
All right, you better
start riding skin off that horse of yours

548
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,646
if you want to stay out
ahead of them.

549
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:26,250
The reward cuts bigger
two ways, huh?

550
00:34:26,286 --> 00:34:28,720
You're losing time.

551
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:40,500
All right, now keep
close together.

552
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:42,869
You ride next
to ben.

553
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,138
Come on.

554
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:51,976
Oh, happy home,
where art thou now?

555
00:36:39,062 --> 00:36:41,496
Now, just sit easy.

556
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:06,959
[Gunfire]

557
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:10,996
Let's go!

558
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:12,131
Right!

559
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:30,517
Aah!

560
00:37:40,361 --> 00:37:40,661
[Yelling]

561
00:37:45,934 --> 00:37:46,134
Aah!

562
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,040
Get down!

563
00:37:53,342 --> 00:37:53,509
Aah!

564
00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:10,093
Aah!

565
00:38:11,261 --> 00:38:13,594
[Gun clicks]

566
00:38:27,812 --> 00:38:29,580
[Indian yelling]

567
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:29,847
[Gunshot]

568
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:32,884
[Gunshot]

569
00:39:32,749 --> 00:39:33,682
Anybody got
a match?

570
00:39:33,683 --> 00:39:35,350
You could have
got us all killed.

571
00:39:35,351 --> 00:39:37,852
It worked,
didn't it?

572
00:39:43,693 --> 00:39:46,328
Did you think i was going to
let those indians

573
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:47,496
ride me into the ground?

574
00:39:47,497 --> 00:39:50,431
Let them peel my hide
over a slow-burning fire?

575
00:39:51,302 --> 00:39:53,869
Oh, no.
Not me... partners.

576
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:04,815
Come on. Mount up.

577
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:07,884
You can't sit a-horse
with a slug in your leg, howie.

578
00:40:08,087 --> 00:40:10,587
You get on
that burro.

579
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:13,192
Come on.

580
00:40:25,272 --> 00:40:27,705
[Groaning quietly]

581
00:41:50,196 --> 00:41:51,797
He's done a day's work.

582
00:41:51,798 --> 00:41:54,098
Fix a fire.

583
00:42:04,845 --> 00:42:05,745
[Screaming]
Where are they?

584
00:42:05,746 --> 00:42:08,047
Where are they?
Where'd they take her?

585
00:42:08,048 --> 00:42:09,283
Where'd they take her?

586
00:42:09,284 --> 00:42:12,151
Get your hands off me!
Get your hands off me!

587
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,021
I've got to find her!
I've got to!

588
00:42:15,123 --> 00:42:17,424
I've got to find her!

589
00:42:17,425 --> 00:42:19,159
He been like
this long?

590
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,227
Not as bad.

591
00:42:20,228 --> 00:42:22,662
[Breathing heavily]

592
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:30,170
What are you trying
to do, drown him?

593
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,173
Here. Give me
that handkerchief.

594
00:42:37,814 --> 00:42:40,215
Mary. Mary. Mary!

595
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:45,723
Mary...

596
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:49,625
don't worry.

597
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,962
The war won't last
a year.

598
00:42:51,963 --> 00:42:54,497
I'll be home
before you know it.

599
00:42:54,498 --> 00:42:57,599
No sense getting married
and then having to say good-bye.

600
00:42:57,602 --> 00:43:00,035
You understand that.

601
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:02,206
Sure, i understand.

602
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:04,640
Now, get some sleep.

603
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,577
You can manage, mary.

604
00:43:06,578 --> 00:43:08,579
The boys will take care
of the stock.

605
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,181
When i get back,
it'll be just like

606
00:43:10,182 --> 00:43:12,783
we talked about
last night.

607
00:43:13,586 --> 00:43:15,119
You understand, mary?

608
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,788
You remember
what you said?

609
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:18,656
I remember.

610
00:43:18,657 --> 00:43:21,192
I said i'll wait for you.

611
00:43:29,002 --> 00:43:31,437
He got what was
coming to him.

612
00:43:31,438 --> 00:43:33,206
Half of abilene
knows about it.

613
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:35,608
I've heard of
some big suckers in my time...

614
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:38,110
this ain't
our affair!

615
00:43:38,212 --> 00:43:39,245
You know what he done?

616
00:43:39,246 --> 00:43:41,180
When he marched off
to preserve the union,

617
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:43,049
he signed over
his ranch to this gal

618
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,486
so she could
work it legal.

619
00:43:45,487 --> 00:43:46,353
Guess what.

620
00:43:46,354 --> 00:43:48,422
Come back to find out
she'd sold it...

621
00:43:48,423 --> 00:43:51,191
used the money
to run off with another fella!

622
00:43:51,192 --> 00:43:53,193
It's nothing
to laugh at!

623
00:43:53,194 --> 00:43:55,829
No? Well,
laugh at this, then!

624
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,933
What am i
supposed to do, cry?

625
00:43:58,934 --> 00:44:01,236
Feel sorry for him?

626
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:03,538
I got nothing against
these fellas.

627
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:05,173
They just happened along.

628
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:07,875
But him... i never hurt him
no ways,

629
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,913
and he starts out
to hunt me!

630
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,515
Days, weeks,
like an animal.

631
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:14,918
That's enough.

632
00:44:14,919 --> 00:44:17,353
This ain't none of
our business.

633
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,855
He wants his land back,

634
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,925
and i'll tell you
something,

635
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:24,827
his end of the reward
ain't enough to buy it.

636
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,697
That's
# your business.

637
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,803
I think i'll make
some coffee.

638
00:44:35,341 --> 00:44:38,308
Then why did he make
a deal with us to begin with?

639
00:44:39,378 --> 00:44:41,012
Howie's a practical man.

640
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:44,181
He needed you fellas' help
to get through this rough country.

641
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,852
But the closer we get
to abilene,

642
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,855
the more you've got
to worry.

643
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,641
Given my choice,
i'll take hand-panning

644
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:10,377
and running water
naturally,

645
00:45:10,378 --> 00:45:13,312
especially when
you're working alone like i do.

646
00:45:13,748 --> 00:45:14,915
Of course, when you
get a strike

647
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:17,684
in high country...
like here, for instance...

648
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:20,121
your big problem
is getting the water

649
00:45:20,122 --> 00:45:21,622
to where
you're digging.

650
00:45:21,623 --> 00:45:24,391
Yeah. That's the trouble
my friend had.

651
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:27,595
Ground full of gold
and no water to work it...

652
00:45:28,063 --> 00:45:28,230
hey.

653
00:45:28,697 --> 00:45:30,131
Now maybe
you'll shut up!

654
00:45:30,132 --> 00:45:32,200
I've been meaning
to ask...

655
00:45:32,201 --> 00:45:34,403
you talk
like you seen

656
00:45:34,404 --> 00:45:37,106
this fella's mine
with your own eyes.

657
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:39,407
Just heard.

658
00:45:39,442 --> 00:45:41,176
Never hit it,
huh, jesse?

659
00:45:41,177 --> 00:45:43,112
Nothing worth
the mention.

660
00:45:43,113 --> 00:45:45,780
Seems i been looking
all my life.

661
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,918
All my life.

662
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:49,318
That's a long time

663
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:50,453
to look
for something.

664
00:45:50,454 --> 00:45:53,288
Maybe you been looking
in the wrong places.

665
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:56,126
Fella says there's
gold in the valley,

666
00:45:56,127 --> 00:45:57,594
i go to
the valley.

667
00:45:57,595 --> 00:45:59,930
Fella says dig here,
i dig.

668
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:02,666
Fella says
there's a rush on to the north,

669
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:03,935
i go north.

670
00:46:03,936 --> 00:46:06,502
In '49,
run to california.

671
00:46:06,605 --> 00:46:09,473
Still remember...
spent good money for maps.

672
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:11,443
Even made
my own maps.

673
00:46:11,444 --> 00:46:14,046
I've seen fellas
too drunk to walk

674
00:46:14,047 --> 00:46:16,448
fall on their face
and find gold,

675
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:18,783
but never me.

676
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:22,020
Hey, jesse!

677
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:24,321
Where's roy?

678
00:46:25,024 --> 00:46:27,193
He rode off
before dawn.

679
00:46:27,194 --> 00:46:28,561
Didn't say where.

680
00:46:28,562 --> 00:46:30,229
That's enough
shaving.

681
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:32,465
Give me that.

682
00:46:32,466 --> 00:46:34,800
Drop it there.

683
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:42,808
Well, you slept
yourself out.

684
00:46:43,511 --> 00:46:46,179
Must be halfway
to noon almost.

685
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,915
Why didn't
somebody wake me?

686
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:49,684
What's everybody
lying around for?

687
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:49,851
Oh!

688
00:46:50,652 --> 00:46:53,320
That tells you
better than me.

689
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:58,026
You get him
some breakfast.

690
00:46:58,027 --> 00:47:00,761
You can change the wrapping,
girlie.

691
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:01,864
Why me?

692
00:47:02,499 --> 00:47:03,765
Because i say so!

693
00:47:03,766 --> 00:47:04,966
Don't fuss
all the time!

694
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:06,001
Hold on, jesse.

695
00:47:06,002 --> 00:47:08,004
This girl's been up
half the night

696
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:09,071
taking care of him.

697
00:47:09,072 --> 00:47:11,439
She's wore out.

698
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:14,175
Never mind, ben.

699
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:16,646
Here, i'll do it.

700
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:16,947
Lay still!

701
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:18,981
You don't have to.

702
00:47:18,982 --> 00:47:21,283
I'll do it!

703
00:47:23,855 --> 00:47:25,856
You sat up with me?

704
00:47:25,857 --> 00:47:26,057
Yeah.

705
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:27,058
Why?

706
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:28,225
Somebody had to.

707
00:47:28,226 --> 00:47:30,628
You was raving so,
no one could sleep.

708
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:31,228
Why should you care?

709
00:47:31,229 --> 00:47:34,330
I don't. I'd have
done it for a dog, if he was suffering.

710
00:47:34,466 --> 00:47:34,733
Thank you.

711
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,767
You're welcome.

712
00:47:38,103 --> 00:47:40,804
You said i was raving.
What about?

713
00:47:41,807 --> 00:47:44,175
Nothing
that made sense.

714
00:47:44,176 --> 00:47:45,843
You thought
i was your girl.

715
00:47:45,844 --> 00:47:47,646
You kept calling me mary.

716
00:47:47,647 --> 00:47:49,347
You were really
out of your head.

717
00:47:49,348 --> 00:47:51,784
We ain't nothing alike,
mary and me.

718
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,418
At least that's what
ben says.

719
00:47:53,419 --> 00:47:55,353
Ben's just like all
the rest of them.

720
00:47:55,354 --> 00:47:56,255
He never even
met her.

721
00:47:56,256 --> 00:47:57,390
Well, he knows
what she did!

722
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:58,357
What she did's
her business.

723
00:47:58,358 --> 00:48:00,260
She had no business
selling your ranch!

724
00:48:00,261 --> 00:48:01,161
All right,
you're different.

725
00:48:01,162 --> 00:48:02,728
You would have
done it different.

726
00:48:02,729 --> 00:48:04,430
Let's let it go.

727
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:07,066
How do you mean,
i'm different?

728
00:48:08,335 --> 00:48:10,803
I mean
you got a man.

729
00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:13,507
At least
you stick to him.

730
00:48:13,508 --> 00:48:14,741
He's not my man!

731
00:48:14,742 --> 00:48:16,143
Well, you're
with him, ain't you?

732
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:17,144
Not like you mean!

733
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:19,612
All right.
Forget it.

734
00:48:23,586 --> 00:48:26,320
What are you doing
with ben, anyway?

735
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:29,323
You expect to run
and hide forever?

736
00:48:30,259 --> 00:48:31,960
Ben was taking me
to california.

737
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:33,662
He was going to
start new.

738
00:48:33,663 --> 00:48:35,396
Start new at what?

739
00:48:35,397 --> 00:48:38,299
Ranching, maybe.
He knows a lot about cattle.

740
00:48:39,168 --> 00:48:40,669
Yeah.
Other people's cattle.

741
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,305
Did you ever think
for a minute

742
00:48:44,274 --> 00:48:47,175
that ben had the temper
to settle on the land,

743
00:48:47,745 --> 00:48:50,345
to clear it,
to build on it,

744
00:48:50,914 --> 00:48:52,616
to bring in the cattle

745
00:48:52,617 --> 00:48:55,284
and nurse them through
the winter

746
00:48:55,353 --> 00:48:57,786
and round up strays,

747
00:48:59,423 --> 00:49:01,158
brand calves?

748
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:02,793
Starting new?

749
00:49:02,794 --> 00:49:05,463
The only thing
ben will start is trouble.

750
00:49:05,464 --> 00:49:07,732
He's wild, sure,

751
00:49:07,733 --> 00:49:09,968
like my father
used to be.

752
00:49:09,969 --> 00:49:13,170
But they didn't do
1 of the 10 things people blamed them for!

753
00:49:13,205 --> 00:49:15,173
He's mean,
he was born mean,

754
00:49:15,174 --> 00:49:17,208
and you know he
was born mean.

755
00:49:17,209 --> 00:49:18,209
He's treated me
decent!

756
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,511
Well, that's more
than he's done for most people.

757
00:49:19,512 --> 00:49:22,181
I've never seen him
hurt no one except in a fair fight.

758
00:49:22,182 --> 00:49:23,215
Sure, i know, sure.

759
00:49:23,216 --> 00:49:23,949
And who are you
to talk?

760
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:26,051
You didn't track him
all this way just because he's mean!

761
00:49:26,052 --> 00:49:26,719
Never said i did.

762
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,789
There's a lot
of outlaws riding free, with no one after them.

763
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:30,823
Ben could have killed
a dozen men,

764
00:49:30,824 --> 00:49:32,692
and you wouldn't have
looked twice...

765
00:49:32,693 --> 00:49:35,294
if it wasn't for
the reward!

766
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:49,475
Where have you been?

767
00:49:50,012 --> 00:49:51,145
How's the leg?

768
00:49:51,146 --> 00:49:53,813
Here you are.
Breakfast in bed.

769
00:49:56,552 --> 00:49:57,585
What's this?

770
00:49:57,586 --> 00:50:00,289
You better eat it
before we tell you.

771
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,291
I made a map
of the trail ahead. Here, take a look.

772
00:50:03,993 --> 00:50:06,094
I know the way.

773
00:50:06,095 --> 00:50:06,396
Hey, look.

774
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:09,665
Here's this
pony back ridge

775
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:11,734
marked along
this stretch of trees.

776
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:14,803
You follow these
mountains right down to the big river,

777
00:50:15,206 --> 00:50:17,872
and we'll meet
on the other side.

778
00:50:18,575 --> 00:50:18,843
Meet who?

779
00:50:19,009 --> 00:50:21,177
What he means,
all of you go on ahead,

780
00:50:21,178 --> 00:50:24,079
and i use this map
to catch up with you later.

781
00:50:25,717 --> 00:50:26,450
That's right,
isn't it?

782
00:50:26,451 --> 00:50:29,552
It's the only smart way.
Riding alone, he can make up time

783
00:50:29,921 --> 00:50:31,722
it would take us
days to cover,

784
00:50:31,723 --> 00:50:34,190
and the rain's coming.

785
00:50:34,693 --> 00:50:35,927
Well, jesse,
what do you think?

786
00:50:35,928 --> 00:50:38,229
I'm thinking if
something goes wrong

787
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,597
and you don't
meet up with us,

788
00:50:39,598 --> 00:50:42,466
i stand to gain from it
as much as roy here.

789
00:50:42,935 --> 00:50:44,769
That's
a dirty idea!

790
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:47,671
I ain't much proud of it,
but it's the truth.

791
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:50,909
Won't be that way with me
is all i can promise.

792
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,845
As soon as we
get across,

793
00:50:52,846 --> 00:50:55,414
we wait for you
on the other side.

794
00:50:55,415 --> 00:50:58,149
You got jesse's word
on it, and mine.

795
00:51:11,165 --> 00:51:13,233
Here. This is yours.

796
00:51:13,234 --> 00:51:15,602
Come on, let's get
the horses ready.

797
00:51:15,603 --> 00:51:16,436
I'm riding with you.

798
00:51:16,437 --> 00:51:18,071
What are you you
trying to do,

799
00:51:18,072 --> 00:51:18,873
kill yourself?

800
00:51:18,874 --> 00:51:20,408
I ain't gonna
cheat you.

801
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:21,542
You know,
your trouble is

802
00:51:21,543 --> 00:51:23,778
you just think of
one thing at a time.

803
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:25,513
If this is his plan
to get rid of me,

804
00:51:25,514 --> 00:51:26,680
who's next?

805
00:51:26,681 --> 00:51:29,149
Just think
that over!

806
00:52:18,204 --> 00:52:19,972
You better let roy
ride drag.

807
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:22,306
You ain't fit.

808
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:42,863
You know, howie,

809
00:52:42,864 --> 00:52:44,798
i ain't been
tied up like this

810
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:47,433
since i was
knee-high to spit,

811
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:50,436
about the time pa sold
our place in missouri

812
00:52:51,272 --> 00:52:53,674
and started us out
for texas.

813
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:56,377
I didn't want to go,
so i run off.

814
00:52:57,546 --> 00:52:58,580
He caught me,

815
00:52:58,581 --> 00:53:01,382
tied me up,
and thrown me in the wagon.

816
00:53:03,853 --> 00:53:05,588
That was
a hard winter.

817
00:53:05,589 --> 00:53:08,389
Ma caught the fever
and died on the way.

818
00:53:13,964 --> 00:53:16,697
Pa didn't amount to much
after that.

819
00:53:17,267 --> 00:53:19,868
Got gunned down
in a saloon

820
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:22,405
before we ever saw texas.

821
00:53:23,508 --> 00:53:26,475
After that, i met up with
some wild young fellas.

822
00:53:29,213 --> 00:53:31,881
You might say
i come to no good.

[Horse whinnies]

824
00:53:42,762 --> 00:53:43,062
Look out!

825
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,887
Come on,
you buzzard bait!

826
00:54:40,223 --> 00:54:40,423
Move!

[Snoring]

828
00:55:37,518 --> 00:55:38,685
Is it time yet?

829
00:55:38,686 --> 00:55:41,387
Pretty near.
I can't sleep anyway.

[Horse whinnying]

831
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:45,357
Might be a cat
poking around.

832
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:47,927
I'll go and see.

833
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:53,700
[Thunder]

834
00:57:18,026 --> 00:57:19,360
I'd better see

835
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:22,028
what's at
the other end.

836
00:57:26,468 --> 00:57:28,002
Now, this ain't bad.

837
00:57:28,003 --> 00:57:31,005
We could all do with
some of jesse's coffee.

838
00:57:34,644 --> 00:57:35,011
Hey, roy.

839
00:57:36,345 --> 00:57:38,347
Wet cords
are shrinking.

840
00:57:38,348 --> 00:57:39,448
How about it?

841
00:57:39,449 --> 00:57:42,284
I'm not going out
in this weather.

842
00:57:56,467 --> 00:57:57,767
Easy there, girlie.

843
00:57:57,768 --> 00:58:00,536

down on us.

Hey, lina, honey.

849
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:18,121
This weather's
creeping into my bones.

850
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:21,392
Can you do me?

851
00:58:31,372 --> 00:58:34,172
I wonder if you
really need this

852
00:58:34,342 --> 00:58:37,176
or if you just like
to be rubbed.

853
00:58:37,778 --> 00:58:38,979
Same thing.

854
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,680

what he likes.

Poor old howie.

00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:54,094
That bad leg's
just about got him wore out.

857
00:58:55,097 --> 00:58:57,999
Might not be too sharp
on his watch tonight.

858
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,034
Shouldn't
have to stand one, the way he is.

00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,537
Better for us.

860
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:04,239
This might be
our chance.

861

He's come around
on his feeling for you.

862
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:10,044
If you was to sit up
with him tonight

863
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:13,382
and tell him the things
a man likes to know, you know?

864
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:17,352
Only be a minute
before i'd be out of that hole in back.

865
00:59:19,356 --> 00:59:20,957
But if kemp
finds out...

866
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,560
finds out what?
I'll be long gone.

He's got no feeling
for me.

out of it.

my only hope is

that he'll drop off,

at least long enough
for me to...

and smash his head in.

01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:16,516
It'll be all right.

887
01:00:16,517 --> 01:00:19,285
Now, you get
some coffee, huh?

888
01:00:50,887 --> 01:00:51,255
[Snoring]

889
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,073
What's the matter?

890
01:01:40,074 --> 01:01:42,575
Nothing. Restless.

891
01:01:42,877 --> 01:01:45,612
[Rain pattering musically
on dishes]

892
01:01:45,613 --> 01:01:48,082
Stuff's been out
long enough.

893
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:50,917
It can't hurt it.
It's all right.

894
01:02:18,448 --> 01:02:19,381
It's, uh,
making music.

895
01:02:19,382 --> 01:02:20,383
There's a sour one
someplace.

896
01:02:20,384 --> 01:02:20,685
Roy's.

897
01:02:23,053 --> 01:02:25,288
Without that,
it sounds better

898
01:02:25,289 --> 01:02:27,891
than some fiddlers
i've heard.

899
01:02:27,892 --> 01:02:29,993
Is dancing
hard to learn?

900
01:02:29,994 --> 01:02:32,696
Nope. Not the way
i do it.

901
01:02:33,364 --> 01:02:35,566
Do you like it?

902
01:02:35,567 --> 01:02:35,867
Yeah.

903
01:02:36,702 --> 01:02:37,035
Used to.

904
01:02:38,104 --> 01:02:39,770
Sometimes
i just like

905
01:02:39,771 --> 01:02:42,306
to sit outside
by a window

906
01:02:42,307 --> 01:02:44,975
and listen to
the music.

907
01:02:46,579 --> 01:02:46,946
Like now.

908
01:02:50,149 --> 01:02:52,950
Did you ever see
mexican dancing?

909
01:02:57,490 --> 01:03:00,692
What are you gonna do
when you get back to abilene?

910
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:03,296
Help ben if i can.

911
01:03:03,297 --> 01:03:06,265
Don't you
want anything for yourself?

912
01:03:08,569 --> 01:03:11,436
Used to think of
going to california.

913
01:03:12,473 --> 01:03:14,940
Why california?

914
01:03:15,009 --> 01:03:16,744
Someplace new.

915
01:03:16,745 --> 01:03:19,313
Nobody caring
who you are

916
01:03:19,314 --> 01:03:21,715
or where
you come from.

917
01:03:21,716 --> 01:03:24,450
A place you could
belong to.

918
01:03:24,586 --> 01:03:24,953
A... house.

919
01:03:26,388 --> 01:03:28,955
Maybe even neighbors.

920
01:03:29,091 --> 01:03:31,792
I had neighbors,
you know.

921
01:03:31,894 --> 01:03:33,828
Tom webster
and his missis

922
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:36,165
lived right across
the river.

923
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,166
Had four sons,

924
01:03:37,167 --> 01:03:39,735
each one of them
skinnier than the other.

925
01:03:39,736 --> 01:03:42,570
Always coming over
to lend a hand.

926
01:03:44,341 --> 01:03:46,575
Didn't give you
much chance

927
01:03:46,576 --> 01:03:48,577
to get lonesome.

928
01:03:48,578 --> 01:03:49,946
Well, the house...

929
01:03:49,947 --> 01:03:51,447
the house
ain't much,

930
01:03:51,448 --> 01:03:53,917
but it's just prime
cattle country.

931
01:03:53,918 --> 01:03:56,653
And the fella that
owns the ranch now,

932
01:03:56,654 --> 01:03:59,255
he's willing
to sell.

933
01:04:00,525 --> 01:04:01,692
Maybe you'd...

934
01:04:01,693 --> 01:04:04,360
like to take
a look at it

935
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:06,396
after i buy it back.

936
01:04:06,397 --> 01:04:09,099
With the money
you get for ben?

937
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:12,135
That's something else.
I'm talking to you now.

938
01:04:12,504 --> 01:04:15,173
Be like stepping
on a grave.

939
01:04:15,174 --> 01:04:17,942
You know what
i'm asking you?

940
01:04:19,746 --> 01:04:22,446
I... can't say
how i feel,

941
01:04:22,716 --> 01:04:25,249
the way things are.

942
01:05:32,957 --> 01:05:35,458
All right. Get up!

943
01:05:40,866 --> 01:05:43,567
Come on! Come on!
Get up!

944
01:06:00,954 --> 01:06:01,288
Come on.

945
01:06:01,888 --> 01:06:04,689
We're through
fooling with you.

946
01:06:04,926 --> 01:06:05,292
Quit that!

947
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,126
"Dead or alive"
it says!

948
01:06:07,127 --> 01:06:08,995
Stop him!
Ben won't have a chance!

949
01:06:08,996 --> 01:06:11,831
A chance at what...
to kill us all?

950
01:06:12,434 --> 01:06:15,501
If that's what you want,
i'll give him a chance.

951
01:06:16,905 --> 01:06:19,439
Now, cut him loose.

952
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:21,843
Don't let him
do it.

953
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:24,277
Cut him loose!

954
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,517
All right, ben.

955
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,855
It ain't
a fair fight, howie.

956
01:06:34,891 --> 01:06:37,424
My hands ain't fit.

957
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:43,098
You're ready now.
Anytime.

958
01:06:43,901 --> 01:06:46,334
Come on, draw.

959
01:06:59,017 --> 01:07:01,818
I ain't got a prayer
against you,

960
01:07:02,687 --> 01:07:04,655
and you know it.

961
01:07:04,656 --> 01:07:07,223
It's your first move.

962
01:07:07,393 --> 01:07:10,260
If you're going to
murder me, howie,

963
01:07:10,429 --> 01:07:12,998
don't try
to make it look

964
01:07:12,999 --> 01:07:14,666
like something else.

965
01:07:14,667 --> 01:07:17,100
Come on, draw.

966
01:07:21,408 --> 01:07:21,774
Kill him!

967
01:07:38,259 --> 01:07:38,625
All right.

968
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:40,661
Ohh!

969
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:43,329
Leave it be!
It's getting so

970
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:46,331
i don't know which way
to point this no more.

971
01:07:46,701 --> 01:07:48,536
How many chances
does he get?

972
01:07:48,537 --> 01:07:51,404
Is this part of
your deal with her?

973
01:07:52,174 --> 01:07:52,541
I didn't...

974
01:07:52,841 --> 01:07:56,009
you didn't keep me busy
while he was making his break?

975
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:00,315
Nah, it just
happened that way.

976
01:08:00,316 --> 01:08:03,016
It just happened
that way.

977
01:08:53,873 --> 01:08:56,275
This is no good.
Any more shortcuts?

978
01:08:56,276 --> 01:08:58,912
[Jesse]
There's no sense stewin' about it.

979
01:08:58,913 --> 01:09:01,513
We got here late,
and that's it.

980
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:03,883
That's the time you cost us!
If you'd listened to me...

981
01:09:03,884 --> 01:09:06,185
i'll listen to
you now if you got any ideas

982
01:09:06,186 --> 01:09:07,820
about how to
get across here.

983
01:09:07,821 --> 01:09:09,223
You can't
get across that.

984
01:09:09,224 --> 01:09:11,558
You got to go
downstream a ways.

985
01:09:11,559 --> 01:09:11,892
How far?

986
01:09:12,526 --> 01:09:14,895
Oh, four or five days,
if we make time.

987
01:09:14,896 --> 01:09:17,097
We can swim this,
so let's start now!

988
01:09:17,098 --> 01:09:19,266
I'll take the point
if you're afraid.

989
01:09:19,267 --> 01:09:21,335
Least i got the sense
to be afraid.

990
01:09:21,336 --> 01:09:22,237
Besides,
what about her?

991
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,439
She wouldn't
last two minutes in that current.

992
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,142
You want to go downstream?
Take her with you.

993
01:09:27,143 --> 01:09:29,811
What if ben gets
washed away?

994
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:31,279
Then we got nothing.

995
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,781
I bow to your
superior wisdom.

996
01:09:32,782 --> 01:09:35,217
I promise you, jesse,
he'll get across.

997
01:09:35,218 --> 01:09:36,551
One way
or the other.

998
01:09:36,552 --> 01:09:37,386
Hey! Wait a minute!

999
01:09:37,387 --> 01:09:39,388
I'll try the river,
but not like this.

1000
01:09:39,389 --> 01:09:40,722
Yes, like this!
Why not?

1001
01:09:40,723 --> 01:09:43,591
We'll go downstream
before we cross.

1002
01:09:46,129 --> 01:09:48,331
What are you
worried about? Your girl?

1003
01:09:48,332 --> 01:09:51,233
Don't tell me you're
worried about him!

1004
01:09:53,804 --> 01:09:55,839
Why? It's
no different from the rope in abilene.

1005
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,308
You knew you were
gonna bring him back to die

1006
01:09:58,309 --> 01:10:00,478
when you started
after him. You know that now.

1007
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:03,214
That hasn't changed.
He's not a man.

1008
01:10:03,215 --> 01:10:04,548
He's a sack
of money.

1009
01:10:04,549 --> 01:10:07,185
That's why
we're all here... especially you!

1010
01:10:07,186 --> 01:10:09,953
Why don't you
face up to it!

1011
01:12:05,146 --> 01:12:08,012
I don't suppose either of you object

1012
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:11,016
to stopping the night here.

1013
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:14,486
Yeah, i didn't think so.

1014
01:12:18,092 --> 01:12:18,393
L-i...

1015
01:12:23,432 --> 01:12:25,767
hey, lina, honey.

1016
01:12:25,768 --> 01:12:28,301
It's my back again.

1017
01:12:28,571 --> 01:12:30,272
Can you do me?

1018
01:12:30,273 --> 01:12:32,574
Let me do you this time.

1019
01:12:32,575 --> 01:12:35,376
Start fixing for a fire, girlie.

1020
01:12:37,747 --> 01:12:39,682
How do you
like your rubbin'?

1021
01:12:39,683 --> 01:12:42,184
Up and down
or side to side?

1022
01:12:42,185 --> 01:12:44,553
Hey! You don't
have to do that.

1023
01:12:44,554 --> 01:12:46,856
Better look
after your partners.

1024
01:12:46,857 --> 01:12:47,991
Partners, uhh.

1025
01:12:47,992 --> 01:12:50,126
If i didn't need
a grubstake,

1026
01:12:50,127 --> 01:12:53,162
i'd have walked out
on this deal long ago.

1027
01:12:53,631 --> 01:12:54,698
It's too bad.

1028
01:12:54,699 --> 01:12:56,667
If you'd been lucky
like my friend...

1029
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:58,635
and i've had about
enough of that, too.

1030
01:12:58,636 --> 01:13:00,804
You got no friend
found gold around here.

1031
01:13:00,805 --> 01:13:01,738
You're talking
about yourself!

1032
01:13:01,739 --> 01:13:05,041
I knowed i shouldn't
have shot off my mouth in front of you.

1033
01:13:06,244 --> 01:13:06,911
Quit playacting.

1034
01:13:06,912 --> 01:13:09,746
You wanted me to
know it all along,

1035
01:13:10,215 --> 01:13:12,749
so let's get at it.

1036
01:13:13,819 --> 01:13:15,487
You tell me
where to dig,

1037
01:13:15,488 --> 01:13:18,522
and i'll see
that your gal is provided for.

1038
01:13:18,692 --> 01:13:20,258
Don't try to
horse-trade me, jesse.

1039
01:13:20,259 --> 01:13:23,495
I ain't gonna tell
where my gold is, but i'll show you.

1040
01:13:24,964 --> 01:13:28,200
I knew that's what
you've been scratchin' for all along.

1041
01:13:28,635 --> 01:13:30,837
Trouble is,
i don't trust you

1042
01:13:30,838 --> 01:13:32,839
no more
than i trust them.

1043
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,173
You don't
have to trust nobody.

1044
01:13:34,174 --> 01:13:36,843
Even if you don't
fancy my gold mine,

1045
01:13:36,844 --> 01:13:39,413
you still got me
all to yourself.

1046
01:13:39,414 --> 01:13:41,048
That's sayin'
i trust you.

1047
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:43,717
Say i tell you
where my gold is,

1048
01:13:43,718 --> 01:13:45,618
you might still
turn me in.

1049
01:13:45,619 --> 01:13:48,421
If i make a deal,
i stick by it.

1050
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:53,060
Least i wouldn't
have any partners

1051
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:54,695
to worry about.

1052
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:55,064
'Cept me.

1053
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,232
What do you mean, you?

1054
01:13:57,233 --> 01:13:59,234
If i did it...
now, just if...

1055
01:13:59,235 --> 01:14:00,602
it would be
an even swap.

1056
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,804
You'd go loose,
i'd get the gold mine.

1057
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,005
That ain't fair,
jesse.

1058
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:06,840
I got a right to
some of that gold.

1059
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:09,910
Fair or no,
it's the only deal i'd make...
