1
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,449
But this is a nice car.

2
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,454
Hotel, Señor? Hotel?

3
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,542
Visit the city?
Would you like to visit the Cathedral?

4
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,594
The prison.

5
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,271
For Tepepa.

6
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,677
For Tepepa.

7
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,817
All this for your
wonderful Tepepa ...

8
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,534
He has only
to live two hours.

9
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,334
actually it comes convenient


10
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:09,928
are like ... Tepepa and affect
negative impact on our balance sheet .

11
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,286
Tepepas people ...

12
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,950
No, it was not difficult.

13
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,169
None of them carried a gun.

14
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,875
All were unarmed .
That was nice ...

15
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:49,176
It was a kind of target shooting.
Just the thing for our recruits.

16
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,279
They were in shock
paralyzed.

17
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,240
From a distance they
all lokked the same.

18
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,544
Only Tepepa ... stood out .

19
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:23,667
Like a crazed eagle
in the middle of scarecrows .

20
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,252
I gave the order ,
not to shoot him ...

21
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,836
.. because I wanted him alive.

22
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,505
But that he did not know.

23
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,395
Nevertheless, he marched ahead,
screaming,

24
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,734
Cascorro , I 'll kill you!
I 'll kill you!

25
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,236
I 'll kill you!

26
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,244
I 'll kill you!

27
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,906
Paco .

28
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,046
He's dead

29
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,947
Excuse me.
American?

30
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,528
No.

31
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,948
English.

32
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:40,124
I'm sorry , you have your lunch
ruined, Señor ...

33
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,378
Doctor.

34
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,919
Doctor Henry Price.

35
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,838
- Doctor of Medicine?
- Yes.

36
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,931
Colonel Cascorro .
Sit down .

37
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,724
Too bad ...

38
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:02,855
that ... we get to know us under such ...
unpleasant circumstances.

39
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,221
Yes, that's a shame.

40
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,823
But I would still like to
take the opportunity.

41
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,407
Huh?

42
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,985
Yes, I need to ask for a favor.

43
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,606
Ask away.

44
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,048
This ... is Tepepa.

45
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,224
Did I understand it properly, Doctor?

46
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:25,846
According to this Italian scientists
you spoke of , this Lombroso ...

47
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:30,059
..you can recognize a criminal by
the shape of his face?

48
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:34,020
Yes, Colonel .
The criminalcan be revealed by...

49
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:43,245
... the shape of the skull , jaw ,
the ear lobes and teeth fix .

50
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,165
What about the ass, Señor?

51
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,291
The trained eye determines on the basis of
a comparative test of these elements ...

52
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,383
the supposed criminal tendencies ...
of an individual.

53
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:58,087
You would greatly simplify my work,
Doctor.

54
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:04,800
Persons with appropriate characteristics
would all be arrested immediately.

55
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,100
My studies has no such applications.

56
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,314
Colonel ...

57
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,109
Would you allow me to examine 
the prisoner at a better place?

58
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,700
Is the cemetery in order?
You will find him there tonight .

59
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,659
He is to appear at six o'clock.

60
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,205
could you postpone the execution?

61
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,916
Well, Doctor, that's not up to me .
So is the law.

62
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,580
The law is made for those
who can read .

63
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,927
It is a law ...

64
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,802
... the new government.
A law of Madero.

65
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,435
No ...

66
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,896
Madero know nothing of these things!

67
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,188
Madero would never allow this to happen.

68
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:55,605
You have made the law.
Madero would never pass such law!

69
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,069
I only perform his orders.

70
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,031
Madero is not a traitor!

71
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,241
He would never do such a thing!

72
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,828
He signed your death warrant.

73
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,995
Personally.

74
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,918
That's not true!
You're a liar!

75
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,545
You son of a bitch!

76
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,082
You son of a bitch!

77
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,293
That's not true!
You son of a bitch!

78
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,485
Department halt!

79
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,068
Left to!

80
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,205
Load!

81
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,563
Aim!

82
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,746
Fire!

83
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:13,391
After him!
After him , you idiots!

84
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,650
Is that nice!

85
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,188
It's all yellow.

86
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,320
Is that nice!

87
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,033
Even the sky is yellow.

88
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,782
The doctor has a gun.

89
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,419
How come?

90
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,428
Drive!

91
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,605
Let us split up!

92
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,651
Your after them there, the rest with me!

93
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,528
You go there!

94
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,285
You ass hole!

95
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,954
You ass hole!

96
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,706
Ei, ei, ei!

97
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,342
Well done, my boy!

98
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:17,184
Drive faster now, please , for I must go
to President Madero to talk to him.

99
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,102
My gun, please.

100
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,737
Thank you .

101
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,781
Hey ...

102
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,575
Very gently.

103
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,452
- What's going on?
- I want to kill you.

104
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,043
Why did you save me then?

105
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:53,883
Because I want to kill you
with my own hands.

106
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,345
Drive!

107
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,279
Only courage.

108
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,238
- Stop!
- Stop the car!

109
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,875
Hold it!

110
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,496
Drive right through!

111
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,195
Hey Americans! If your coffee is ready...

112
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,034
... remember that I need to see President Madero.

113
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,411
I'm English.

114
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,539
..and I drink tea.

115
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:13,213
Americans, British ...
They're all blond.

116
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,385
Hey, you know what we do?

117
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,754
I pull and you push, okay?

118
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,140
Let's go.

119
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,400
Well, listen to me ...

120
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,403
I said, I steer and you push .

121
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,383
Let's go.

122
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,592
Come on, Doctor!

123
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,017
Come on, let's go!

124
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,094
Let's go, hombre,

00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,023
Come on, go, go!

126
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:16,943
Let's go! Yes, just like that.
That's it.

127
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,656
Exactly!

128
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:22,278
Exactly!
Faster, Doctor! Faster!

129
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,288
Faster! Fast ...

130
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,202
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go , faster ...

131
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,002
Yes, just as ...

132
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,257
- Hey Doctor, what do I do?
- Brake!

133
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,499
- Brake!
- Where is the brake?

134
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,759
- Brake , God damn it!
- Where? Where? Doctor!

135
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,088
- Oh, horror!
- Where is the brake?

136
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,933
For Heaven's sake!
Doctor, where is the brake?

137
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,889
For Heaven's sake !
Where is it? Where is it?

138
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,177
Was he alone?

139
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,682
Yes.

140
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,638
- Are you American?
- No .

141
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:32,515
- And do you like Mexico?
- No!

142
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:15,313
Señor ...

143
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,312
Do you like Mexico?

144
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,412
Why not?

145
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,122
Paquito ...

146
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,497
Do not bother the gentleman.

147
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,627
Excuse me,
Señor ...

148
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:50,677
The child has never seen a foreigner.

149
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,440
You always ask too many questions.

150
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:05,029
It is better if the answers are not
known to certain questions.

151
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,275
Do you agree to that, Señor?

152
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,668
Do you know what they call me, Señor?

153
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,338
"El Piojo" .

154
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:25,588
"The Louse" .
Because I can not wash myself .

155
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,631
I can not even scratch me!
Do you understand?

156
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,810
Do you like Mexico?

157
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:42,981
Sergeant!

158
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,821
Sergeant!

159
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,575
Sergeant!

160
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,336
There is no message.

161
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:05,207
The British Embassy
has not responded.

162
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,463
I can not stay here any longer .
Put me in another cell!

163
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,635
There is no other cell, Señor.

164
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,056
I can pay.

165
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,933
- It is not possible.
- How much do you want?

166
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,693
- Dollars, Señor?
- Yes, dollars.

167
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,935
It is not possible.

168
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,773
Just a moment, Señor.

169
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:34,153
The government will pay us a pittance,
and there are six in my family.

170
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:04,937
My wife is old, Señor.
She is a housewife.

171
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,651
Lie down next to her.

172
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:13,445
I have do not have too to worry?

173
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,742
Is that true, Señor?

174
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,592
Adios.

175
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,430
What was that?
Holy Madonna!

176
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,177
What was that?

177
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,513
Ei, ei, ei ...

178
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,487
Congratulations, Doctor.

179
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,323
You got married, right?

180
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,368
Sorry, Señora.

181
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,642
Urelio!

182
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,229
Francisco!

183
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:56,152
- Tepepa?
- Here.

184
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:05,158
No, no ...

185
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:08,580
You .

186
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,746
Do not you see, I'm busy, Tepepa?

187
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,295
I 'll be right there.
Just a moment.

188
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:15,582
- Francisco!
- Yes, Tepepa?

189
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,171
Take!

190
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:36,320
The dominions...
Good evening.

191
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,440
Hello Raul.
How's it going, Martinez?

192
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:45,071
It was a very good idea Tepepa,
Have you come for me?

193
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,997
No, because of Pedro.

194
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,662
Pedro!

195
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,295
Hey!

196
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:52,838
Pedro!

197
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,751
- Smuggling, what?
- Bigamy .

198
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,181
- What is it ?
- It is illegal too have a second wife.

199
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:12,935
Come on ...

200
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,445
Back.

201
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:19,941
Back!

202
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,032
All right, all right .

203
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:47,012
The dynamite speaks louder than I?

204
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,575
Out with you!

205
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:06,913
Let's go!
Everyone out here .

206
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,656
Out with you!

207
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,029
Pedro?

208
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,911
Pedro!

209
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:14,327
- Tepepa!
- Yes?

210
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:15,915
- Pedro!
- Tepepa!

211
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:18,294
- How are you?
- Tepepa!

212
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,466
- My friend.
- Comrade.

213
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,961
Tepepa does not forget his friends,
right, Pedrito?

214
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:27,635
Tepepa ...

215
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,309
Tepepa ... comrade .

216
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,195
Hello little one.
And who is this?

217
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:48,413
- Does he belong to you?
- My son .

218
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,282
Beautiful.

219
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,287
And the mother ?

220
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:58,791
Dead.

221
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,717
He seems a to be bright boy?

222
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:06,502
Well ...

223
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:08,297
Pedro ...

224
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,554
How did that happen?

225
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:14,302
The Rurales .

226
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:16,892
They robbed you?

227
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,024
Yes.

228
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:23,443
Much?

229
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:35,164
Shame , shame , shame
shame , shame , shame , shame.

230
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:43,216
I would have need for your hands Pedro.

231
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:48,591
Adios!

232
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,642
Tepepa!

233
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:53,769
Tepepa!

234
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,513
Adios, adios .

235
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,520
Let's go!

236
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:34,615
Tepepa!

237
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,455
Tepepa!

238
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,287
Hey ... Hey!

239
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:26,628
Good day, Doctor.
Did you leave your wife yet?

240
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:28,292
Huh?

241
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:33,250
The Doctor is British.

242
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:35,386
An important man.

243
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:39,227
He wants to kill me, right?

244
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:56,446
You son of a bitch.

245
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,374
That's enough.

246
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,798
I said that's enough!

247
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:23,179
What is this?

248
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:45,994
Pretty, huh?

249
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,190
Should I make him cold, Tepepa?

250
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:22,238
No.

251
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:26,917
The doctor is a much too
sentimental type.

252
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:36,667
And you?

253
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:42,006
Even so, I can be useful to you.

254
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:48,555
Do not send us away, Comrade.

255
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:55,778
So good.

256
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:05,080
We are already a few hands raised.

257
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,751
Who was that?

258
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:53,663
Who ...
Who was that?

259
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:55,712
The Rurales .

260
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,929
The Rurales .

261
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:04,931
Because he was a friend of Tepepa .

262
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:16,766
My God, my God.
What cruelty ...

263
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,821
What cruelty.

264
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:25,576
To destroy these beautiful
white and delicate hands...

265
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,707
Ei, ei, ei...

266
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,703
What is wrong with our country?

267
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:39,081
What unfortunate country.

268
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:43,751
What a sad, unhappy and poor country Mexico is.

269
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:50,178
Among all those
I know, only two could ...

270
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:53,767
Only two could write .

271
00:37:56,776 --> 00:38:00,359
One can not do more
because he has no hands.

272
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,113
And the other is dead

273
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:10,905
What a shame for Mexico,
Compañeros .

274
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:15,997
A country in which only the rich ...

275
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:20,666
the priests and the generals can write.

276
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:28,763
And we will never know what they write ,
since we are not able to read something .

277
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,558
We are a uneducated bunch.

278
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:39,354
We are a uneducated bunch, but ...

279
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:41,779
but ... ...

280
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:47,151
Let's go, muchachos!

281
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:16,477
Write.

282
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,857
Begin!

283
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:39,410
I give you the gun and you write.

284
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:41,581
Then maybe you're kill me.

285
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:52,256
Señor Madero excellence ...

286
00:39:56,771 --> 00:40:00,721
Señor Madero excellence ...
No, no, no . Give it to me , give it to me .

287
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:03,567
Señor Madero ...

288
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:07,531
No, no .

289
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:09,609
Señor Madero ...

290
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:12,241
President Madero ...

291
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:17,908
Comrade Madero ...
Comrade Madero!

292
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:21,543
Comrade Madero ...

293
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:27,251
Do you remember ...

294
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:30,217
at the 23 ... June ...

295
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:32,882
1909 ... ?

296
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:40,602
In the house in Cuzco ...

297
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:44,564
... where you hid youself ...

298
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:47,728
and ... waited for a man.

299
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:54,442
Jesus ... José ... Moran .

300
00:40:56,623 --> 00:41:00,074
Jesus Jose Moran.
That was my father.

301
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:07,375
In that house ...

302
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:12,254
in that house ... ...

303
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:15,546
... that was mine.

304
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:17,886
Comrade ...

305
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:22,770
Do you remember how my father
you brought a message of Pancho Villa?

306
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:27,393
The Rurales had the go and shot him.

307
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:32,066
My father brought you the message ...

308
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:35,777
and laid there ...
already dying.

309
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:40,449
Calm down, sir.

310
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:45,170
- For Madero.
- Yes, Father.

311
00:41:52,053 --> 00:41:53,713
Señor Madero?

312
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:57,223
Señor Madero?

313
00:42:00,228 --> 00:42:01,936
Señor Madero ...

314
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:07,358
The Rurales
my father is wounded.

315
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:37,928
- Where is Madero ?
- He's here. Stay calm.

316
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:39,593
Where is he?

317
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:42,970
He writes a letter.
Stay calm.

318
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:45,636
- Young man .
- He is calling you.

319
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:47,226
Go away.

320
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:49,151
Yes, Father.

321
00:42:57,202 --> 00:43:00,286
- Do you know where he had gone ?
- Yes, Señor .

322
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:02,744
Can you find there?

323
00:43:10,006 --> 00:43:10,920
Yes, Señor.

324
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:12,715
Then go back .

325
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:15,295
It much depends on you.

326
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:58,545
Easy, father ...

327
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:01,305
Take it easy ...

328
00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:04,267
Take it easy ...

329
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,098
Take it easy ...

330
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:12,687
Take it easy ...

331
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:16,652
Now you have to go.

332
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:42,463
Do you remember how urgent you had it, comrade?

333
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:47,936
You said :
"The revolution will not wait".

334
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:51,849
it will not wait".

335
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:58,103
And you did not let me see my father die.

336
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:29,934
Let's go ahead, Doctor.

337
00:45:31,731 --> 00:45:34,056
Do you remember Madero ...

338
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:38,357
the 30th ... September ...

339
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,028
1911 ... ?

340
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:46,075
We had won .

341
00:46:55,815 --> 00:46:57,226
Tepepa, what are you doing?

342
00:46:57,984 --> 00:46:59,728
Mr. President ...

343
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:03,605
Do you remember me?

344
00:47:04,866 --> 00:47:08,780
Jesus Maria Moran ...
aka Tepepa .

345
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:12,623
Land and Freedom .
Do you remember?

346
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:15,873
You do not remember?

347
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:21,089
Anyway, Mr. President.

348
00:47:21,174 --> 00:47:25,172
I took this gun from the army,
to fight against the army .

349
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:27,799
Now I return it to the army.

350
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:30,214
Who won ,
the revolution or the army?

351
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:32,511
The Revolution.

352
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:37,937
- And the army?
- The army serves the state .

353
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:40,562
And we have now
the control of the state .

354
00:47:42,153 --> 00:47:43,233
The state?

355
00:47:43,321 --> 00:47:46,441
The organization of all citizens.

356
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:50,325
- Rich and poor?
- Rich and poor.

357
00:47:53,998 --> 00:47:57,699
Then we have done something wrong, President .

358
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:00,083
For it has all remained the same.

359
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:06,052
No. The rich will be less rich
and the poor less poor.

360
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:07,760
And how will that work?

361
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:11,049
Thanks to the new laws,
which will be follow the army.

362
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:14,095
The same army, against which we have fought?

363
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,635
Yes.

364
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:19,514
These there?

365
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:26,609
Yes.

366
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:34,367
Look, Señor Madero ...

367
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:37,789
... I trust you,
when you say these things.

368
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:41,660
But it's hard for me
to believe what you say.

369
00:48:43,048 --> 00:48:44,127
Gentlemen ...

370
00:48:44,215 --> 00:48:48,509
I think this is a good opportunity 
if you would tell us what you think.

371
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:50,006
Or , General?

372
00:48:50,096 --> 00:48:54,924
A general does not think
Mr. President. He obeys .

373
00:48:56,227 --> 00:49:00,272
And he obeys neither the rich nor the poor.

374
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:02,100
He obeys the country.

375
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:09,986
Do you see ? You said "state" ,
and he "Fatherland" .

376
00:49:10,075 --> 00:49:13,693
Ask him if its arms is allowed
to be part of the fatherland.

377
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:19,994
Excuse me very much, Mr. President.
There are many things I do not understand.

378
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:21,709
Sorry .

379
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:26,589
It is a real shame
because this is a very nice rifle .

380
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:28,881
I want you to take it .

381
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,845
If we need it again one day ,
you give it to me again.

382
00:49:36,726 --> 00:49:39,846
Agreed, but it is all good.
You'll see.

383
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:43,057
God willing, Señor.

384
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:48,934
Long live Madero!

385
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,948
- Long live Madero!
- Long live Madero!

386
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:59,623
- Country and Liberty!
- Country and Liberty!

387
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:05,535
But it was not all good ,
Comrade Madero.

388
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:11,549
You can not imagine,
because you were not there on the day .

389
00:50:12,053 --> 00:50:14,627
And no one would have told you.

390
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,465
But I ... was there .

391
00:50:19,477 --> 00:50:26,476
I worked on the hacienda,
it belonged before the Revolution to... Don Calixto .

392
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:32,065
During the Revolution
it belonged to the peons .

393
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:39,580
And now that the revolution is over,
it belonged again to Don Calixto .

394
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:55,174
It pleases you that Don Calixto is here again.

395
00:50:55,263 --> 00:50:57,422
He has returned from Europe.

396
00:51:01,686 --> 00:51:04,604
apparently it does not please you .

397
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:09,525
I'm sorry ,
but he is nevertheless back.

398
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:12,777
Of course he reposess his house..

399
00:51:12,864 --> 00:51:14,738
His country also .

400
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,027
All land.

401
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:21,246
- Is that clear?
- No, Señor.

402
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:31,876
And who are you?

403
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:36,252
Jesus Maria Moran , aka Tepepa .
Land and Freedom.

404
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:38,841
Nice name , my boy.

405
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:44,094
What's the deal with this
" Land and Freedom " all about ?

406
00:51:44,187 --> 00:51:46,559
Rightful owners take away the land?

407
00:51:47,732 --> 00:51:49,939
Ask the President
what this is all about.

408
00:51:50,026 --> 00:51:54,772
Out of the question!
I'm not as outrageous as you

409
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:58,944
We must all obey the laws ,
don't you think?

410
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:05,121
- Do you not agree?
- No, Señor , no.

411
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:06,786
And why not?

412
00:52:07,502 --> 00:52:11,416
Well, first, because we made
a revolution.

413
00:52:11,506 --> 00:52:14,341
And second, because we have won, Señor.

414
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:19,841
Is there also a third reason,
to violate the law?

415
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:25,436
There is a new law.
The agrarian reform of President Madero.

416
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,058
That is still no law .

417
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:33,815
First, it must be prepared
and submitted to the Parliament.

418
00:52:33,903 --> 00:52:36,691
Parliament then discuss them
and possibly adopt it .

419
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:41,194
But up to that time the law still
protects private property.

420
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:43,859
And the land belongs to its owners.

421
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:50,835
- No, Señor.
- But, Señor.

422
00:52:51,546 --> 00:52:54,215
No, no, this is not possible .

423
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:57,632
Because we have made a revolution
and they won .

424
00:52:58,219 --> 00:53:00,841
Times have changed.

425
00:53:01,931 --> 00:53:04,138
I am the law, my boy.

426
00:53:04,225 --> 00:53:05,885
And you ..

427
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:08,346
are ... nothing .

428
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:11,811
You begin to to get on my nerves.

429
00:53:14,944 --> 00:53:17,815
I declare you under arrest!

430
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:37,834
And now, señor?
What am I now?

431
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:42,679
A man with a death sentence.

432
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:48,178
We prefer to leave before he does something unreasonable .

433
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:49,432
And we?

434
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:52,522
You go with him, Don Calixto.

435
00:53:53,066 --> 00:53:55,521
Do not worry, Don Calixto.

436
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:58,192
We will retreat.

437
00:53:59,197 --> 00:54:01,237
We will calmly retreat .

438
00:54:01,324 --> 00:54:02,949
Forward!

439
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:08,488
God assist them .

440
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:19,121
Take it easy ...

441
00:54:19,217 --> 00:54:21,625
They returned, in fact .

442
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,092
All these peons died.

443
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:29,851
As you know, the machete is one thing,
the machine gun another.

444
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:33,056
I remained alone,
and it seems impossible ...

445
00:54:33,148 --> 00:54:36,980
that the revolution ...
is said to have been good for nothing.

446
00:54:37,068 --> 00:54:41,113
We need to meet, comrade Madero.
We need to talk.

447
00:54:41,197 --> 00:54:44,981
If you should not call us this time ,
we'll call you .

448
00:54:45,618 --> 00:54:47,161
ok ...

449
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,870
Jesus ... Maria Moran .

450
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:54,908
Alias Tepepa .
Land and Freedom .

451
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,061
Thank you.

452
00:55:27,285 --> 00:55:29,076
Do you kill me, or not?

453
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:33,033
Hey ...

454
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:36,290
Another time . Thank you.

455
00:56:14,582 --> 00:56:16,409
Hurry up, Piojo .

456
00:56:17,002 --> 00:56:20,501
And tell all to Madero, which is not in letter.

457
00:56:22,173 --> 00:56:23,584
Pass on to Paquito.

458
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:26,047
- Piojo , God bless you.
- See you soon .

459
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:29,172
- Adios , Papi.
- Adios Piojo.

460
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:33,551
Adios, Tepepa.

461
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:53,428
But now I'm hot!

462
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:31,250
Show yourself, Señorita!

463
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:45,140
Yes, dance for me, Chica!

464
00:58:50,488 --> 00:58:52,647
Get rid of the Sombrero!

465
00:59:09,424 --> 00:59:11,463
Show yourself, Señorita!

466
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:18,567
Hey ... Doctor.

467
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,117
Not for you?

468
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,956
If you want, I call you as soon as I 'm done.

469
01:00:28,044 --> 01:00:30,120
- Hey!
- Hey ...

470
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:36,759
Francisco!

471
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:38,631
Juan!

472
01:00:39,097 --> 01:00:42,014
Let him get some air!

473
01:00:42,517 --> 01:00:44,177
Let's go.

474
01:02:05,475 --> 01:02:07,633
There is no bullets in it .

475
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:12,940
- What?
- It is not loaded.

476
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:49,303
Doctor ...

477
01:02:50,603 --> 01:02:52,062
The girl is sick.

478
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:18,998
Probably appendicitis.

479
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:24,131
Is that bad?

480
01:03:25,972 --> 01:03:28,214
You could die if the appendix is not removed.

481
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:30,099
What do you need to do it?

482
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:40,309
Huh?

483
01:03:43,156 --> 01:03:45,445
At least some light.

484
01:03:45,533 --> 01:03:47,989
And all the alcohol you can find.

485
01:04:04,344 --> 01:04:05,719
She needs to rest.

486
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:09,469
Moistens the lips from time to time,
but don't let her drink anything .

487
01:04:24,197 --> 01:04:27,732
Doctor, please help my boy.

488
01:04:44,676 --> 01:04:46,419
Have you seen?

489
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,681
Someone like you is important here .

490
01:04:52,642 --> 01:04:55,596
They have never seen a doctor their lives.
.

491
01:04:55,687 --> 01:04:57,976
Why do not you stay with us?

492
01:04:59,607 --> 01:05:02,181
Doctor ... come here .

493
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,821
I think we now know better.

494
01:05:06,906 --> 01:05:09,362
I have thought of you often .

495
01:05:10,493 --> 01:05:12,285
And I think ...

496
01:05:12,912 --> 01:05:16,862
So, for me it is clear
you are uneducated as we all are.

497
01:05:17,834 --> 01:05:19,577
And do you know why?

498
01:05:19,669 --> 01:05:28,092
Maybe you know a lot about the intestine,
the ears, the appendix , the nose ...

499
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:30,217
but ... about the soul you know nothing .

500
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:34,223
Think about it.

501
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:38,437
Is one it not stupid if he wants to kill the other,
even though he does not know him?

502
01:05:41,941 --> 01:05:45,773
Are you sure I'm the man
you are looking for?

503
01:05:49,491 --> 01:05:50,486
Well?

504
01:05:55,413 --> 01:05:57,572
Jesus Maria Moran .

505
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:00,041
Alias Tepepa .

506
01:06:00,585 --> 01:06:04,998
No, no, no . Just a moment .
These are two different things .

507
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,628
Jesus Maria Moran or Tepepa.

508
01:06:09,427 --> 01:06:11,052
Tepepa.

509
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:18,013
There we have it!
Mexico is full with Tepepas .

510
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:25,149
There are Tepepas in Santa Cruz, in Yucatán,
in Guadalajara, in Mexico City.

511
01:06:25,235 --> 01:06:28,520
Even in this village
there is still another Tepepa .

512
01:06:28,988 --> 01:06:31,526
There are louder Tepepas .
Wait a minute . Mother ...

513
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:36,152
- How many Tepepas are there in Mexico?
- Many.

514
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:40,201
A single Tepepa has made revolution
in Morelos.

515
01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:45,081
I've never been in Morelos.
Never, never, never and never again .

516
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,627
Do not believe me?

517
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:53,087
Francisco!

518
01:06:53,179 --> 01:06:55,302
- Yes , Tepepa?
- Come here!

519
01:06:59,227 --> 01:07:00,390
What is Tepepa?

520
01:07:00,895 --> 01:07:06,435
Francisco ... we made the revolution together, right?

521
01:07:06,526 --> 01:07:07,901
Sure.

522
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:11,238
We were always together, right?

523
01:07:11,322 --> 01:07:12,271
Yes.

524
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:14,783
Were we ever in Morelos?

525
01:07:17,787 --> 01:07:20,113
No, never , Tepepa .
Never.

526
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,873
You still don't believe me, right?

527
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:37,764
So good.

528
01:07:43,563 --> 01:07:47,347
I do not know how you feel about your mother,
but mine is important to me.

529
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:49,692
Got it?

530
01:07:50,362 --> 01:07:53,197
I swear to you at the head of my mother.

531
01:07:53,281 --> 01:07:55,357
- Tepepa!
- What is it?

532
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:00,621
Tepepa!

533
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:02,872
Madero is here!

534
01:08:05,835 --> 01:08:08,789
Mother!
Madero is here!

535
01:08:09,297 --> 01:08:12,168
Where is our president?
Where is he?

536
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:20,425
Where is he?

537
01:08:21,976 --> 01:08:24,847
He expects us on the road to Toluca.

538
01:08:28,733 --> 01:08:31,568
He expects us on the road to Toluca ...

539
01:08:32,153 --> 01:08:36,566
On the road to Toluca ...
Marieta! Marieta!

540
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:45,786
Paquito! Paquito! Paquito!

541
01:08:48,461 --> 01:08:50,039
Yes , Dad?

542
01:08:52,757 --> 01:08:55,129
A gift for you.

543
01:09:12,193 --> 01:09:13,985
Let's go, Piojo.

544
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:20,153
Piojo , what are you waiting for?
Let's go !

545
01:09:21,828 --> 01:09:24,153
Paquito is to know Madero.

546
01:09:24,247 --> 01:09:26,738
Madero can not wait for you!
Let's go!

547
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:30,707
No, I want to wait for my son.

548
01:10:02,118 --> 01:10:05,487
You really look as Mendoza.

549
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:11,080
Exactly like Mendoza.

550
01:10:12,462 --> 01:10:15,498
Believe me, I swear.

551
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,670
He is the image of Mendoza,
only smaller.

552
01:10:20,136 --> 01:10:22,806
- Who is this Mendoza?
- An Admiral .

553
01:10:23,932 --> 01:10:27,383
We have shot him in Morelos.
And before he died, he cried:

554
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:30,561
"Long live ...
Long live the Navy! "

555
01:10:31,856 --> 01:10:34,691
Hey Admiral !
Let's go !

556
01:10:34,776 --> 01:10:36,815
Let's go, Admiral .

557
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,619
At your service , Admiral.
Let's go !

558
01:11:07,517 --> 01:11:09,842
Piojo!

559
01:11:13,481 --> 01:11:16,399
Come calmly.
Madero has indeed nothing better to do.

560
01:11:16,484 --> 01:11:19,022
Yes , the longer he waits,
the more he enjoys it.

561
01:11:19,112 --> 01:11:23,192
- Come on, give me Paquito . I'll take him .
- No, no, it's okay.

562
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:25,275
We're almost there .

563
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:48,263
Tepepa ... There he is.
With no escort.

564
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:50,010
Only Madero.

565
01:11:53,104 --> 01:11:54,764
I see it .

566
01:11:56,107 --> 01:12:00,235
Why are you telling me,
that he has no escort Piojo ?

567
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,778
Because he has none .
Just like you wanted it, right?

568
01:12:08,912 --> 01:12:10,370
Yes ...

569
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:13,780
Exactly how I wanted it ...

570
01:12:16,252 --> 01:12:20,665
It is very difficult for a father ,
that havee no hands...

571
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:24,342
... raise his child without a mother ,
is not it Piojo ?

572
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:30,264
Right, Piojo ?

573
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:32,014
Yes.

574
01:12:32,102 --> 01:12:35,352
It is also difficult
to find a greater fool than me!

575
01:12:35,438 --> 01:12:37,764
Not true, Piojo? Huh?

576
01:12:37,857 --> 01:12:38,937
No!

577
01:13:45,258 --> 01:13:51,343
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!

578
01:14:01,858 --> 01:14:03,103
Sun ..

579
01:14:04,027 --> 01:14:05,936
So! So!

580
01:14:06,613 --> 01:14:11,773
So! To Hell with you, you damned bastards!

581
01:15:47,464 --> 01:15:50,963
Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be thy name .

582
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:53,209
Thy kingdom come .

583
01:15:53,303 --> 01:15:57,764
Thy will be done ,
as in heaven , so on earth.

584
01:15:57,849 --> 01:16:01,052
Give us our Daily Bread


585
01:16:01,144 --> 01:16:07,265
And forgive us our trespasses ,
as we forgive our Sinners .

586
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:13,148
And lead us not into temptation ,
but deliver us from evil .

587
01:16:13,239 --> 01:16:14,817
Amen .

588
01:16:27,087 --> 01:16:28,664
Quiet ...

589
01:16:38,306 --> 01:16:39,765
Come

590
01:16:43,311 --> 01:16:45,387
Brave horse.

591
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,188
Well done , good ...

592
01:16:48,858 --> 01:16:50,851
Come come

593
01:16:51,277 --> 01:16:53,982
Stay down, stay down .

594
01:18:16,946 --> 01:18:19,947
- And your father?
- He's dead

595
01:18:20,033 --> 01:18:22,987
- The Rurales?
- Tepepa .

596
01:18:25,413 --> 01:18:26,824
Why?

597
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:31,619
Juanito! Juanito!
Juanito, where are you?

598
01:18:32,379 --> 01:18:33,161
Tepepa!

599
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:35,381
Tepepa .

600
01:18:35,799 --> 01:18:39,796
I have fired all my shots .
Who betrayed us?

601
01:18:39,886 --> 01:18:42,258
- El Piojo ?
- No .

602
01:18:42,347 --> 01:18:43,758
No.

603
01:18:45,183 --> 01:18:49,228
It was not El Piojo ,
who betrayed me. He was not.

604
01:18:49,312 --> 01:18:51,886
It was someone from above.

605
01:19:18,508 --> 01:19:20,168
Compañeros ...

606
01:19:22,303 --> 01:19:27,927
The Honorable President of the Republic ,
Don Francisco Madero , has betrayed us all .

607
01:19:28,018 --> 01:19:30,722
Mexico and the Revolution .

608
01:19:30,812 --> 01:19:34,311
As long as only one peon in Mexico are ...

609
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:40,105
... without land ,
Madero is to blame.

610
01:19:40,572 --> 01:19:48,580
And as long as there in Mexico only are single
landowner..

611
01:19:48,663 --> 01:19:50,870
Madero ... so is to blame.

612
01:19:50,957 --> 01:19:55,286
As long as here in Mexico only
a single Rurale shoots around...

613
01:19:55,378 --> 01:19:58,581
Burns down ... things and killing people,
as was done here , Madero's fault .

614
01:19:58,673 --> 01:20:01,425
And if Madero knows nothing
he is still to blame!

615
01:20:01,509 --> 01:20:05,092
And the less he knows about all this,
the more he is to blame!

616
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:09,842
Do you think that when Madero
has betrayed the revolution ...

617
01:20:09,934 --> 01:20:11,642
... we should tell them too?

618
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:12,843
No!

619
01:20:12,937 --> 01:20:17,066
Do you find that when Madero sit down
we should sit down too?

620
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:17,980
No.

621
01:20:18,068 --> 01:20:21,982
And you will find that when Madero craps ,
we should also shit?

622
01:20:22,072 --> 01:20:23,067
- No!
- No!

623
01:20:23,156 --> 01:20:27,070
When Madero craps,
we shit on Madero!

624
01:21:00,026 --> 01:21:04,356
They will find us hard.
At least for a while .

625
01:21:05,115 --> 01:21:09,741
Doctor, you see the street there?
They will take you directly to Ciudad Juarez .

626
01:21:09,828 --> 01:21:11,785
You can not lose your way.

627
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:15,161
Paquito , let's go .

628
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:19,415
- Paquito comes with me.
- It comes with with you?

629
01:21:19,504 --> 01:21:20,998
Yes.

630
01:21:23,508 --> 01:21:25,465
Look at that ...

631
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:29,089
If you go away so far
you need money, Paquito .

632
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:32,715
That was your father.
Now it's yours .

633
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:36,474
Take it . Take it .
It belongs to you .

634
01:21:36,563 --> 01:21:37,843
Yes, a good thing.

635
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:43,983
What a life, is it not, Doctor?
One comes, the other goes .

636
01:21:45,113 --> 01:21:46,737
But I'm happy .

637
01:21:46,823 --> 01:21:49,279
Because you have changed your opinion
about me.

638
01:21:49,367 --> 01:21:52,238
I have not changed my opinion
about you.

639
01:21:52,912 --> 01:21:58,037
- Let's say I have a doubt , nothing more.
- Where are doubts , there is hope , Doctor.

640
01:21:58,126 --> 01:21:59,704
Go with God.
Adios Paquito.

641
01:22:18,521 --> 01:22:20,810
- Juan , the horse!
- Yes .

642
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:30,026
Miguel!

643
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:35,988
What now, Tepepa?

644
01:22:39,334 --> 01:22:45,621
Find men, raise arms
and begin the a new fight.

645
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:55,884
Dr. Price?

646
01:22:58,812 --> 01:23:02,015
The train to California
continues this afternoon at 5:30.

647
01:23:02,107 --> 01:23:04,016
Thank you. Come

648
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:07,643
- Please settle the bill.
- Immediately, Señor .

649
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:14,449
Do you have the intention of
to leave us, Doctor?

650
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:16,445
This early?

651
01:23:19,165 --> 01:23:22,332
Did you enjoy your stay
in Mexico?

652
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:26,119
It was an interesting
and educational experience.

653
01:23:27,674 --> 01:23:30,628
And then why do you no longer stay with us?

654
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,930
- Please?
- Nearly 20 years, for example?

655
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:37,969
If your criminal responsibility is assigned.

656
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:47,936
Your ...
Their studies on Tepepa ...

657
01:23:49,404 --> 01:23:54,611
Tepepas cheekbones ,
his forehead, his ears.

658
01:23:55,326 --> 01:23:59,027
The whole thing is contradictory.
Lombroso's theory is not absolute.

659
01:23:59,122 --> 01:24:02,954
Certain somatic data ca nnot always
tella criminal nature.

660
01:24:03,043 --> 01:24:07,455
You see, doctor, police logs , however,
can be tell always .

661
01:24:07,547 --> 01:24:09,623
I assure you.

662
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:11,925
Who is that?

663
01:24:14,054 --> 01:24:15,927
What is your name ?

664
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:19,050
Pereira .

665
01:24:19,726 --> 01:24:21,434
Pereira ...

666
01:24:23,855 --> 01:24:26,180
I knew your father.

667
01:24:26,274 --> 01:24:28,563
It's gone wrong .

668
01:24:29,027 --> 01:24:30,651
Too bad .

669
01:24:31,654 --> 01:24:35,106
And the money?
Has Tepepa taken it?

670
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,824
No.

671
01:24:40,163 --> 01:24:41,871
Why not?

672
01:24:42,374 --> 01:24:45,659
The father has done it for him.

673
01:24:46,961 --> 01:24:49,797
He has accepted the money
because of him.

674
01:24:51,758 --> 01:24:53,086
Paquito!

675
01:24:53,718 --> 01:24:55,343
Well, wait for me.

676
01:24:55,428 --> 01:24:58,928
- I 'll be right there .
- " I'll be right there " ?

677
01:25:00,392 --> 01:25:02,349
I do not know .

678
01:25:02,435 --> 01:25:05,804
I have a long journey behind me,
to talk with you.

679
01:25:06,523 --> 01:25:10,817
I hope not,
that I have wasted my time.

680
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:33,583
Sit down .
It is better to make yourself comfortable.

681
01:25:40,223 --> 01:25:43,390
Jesus Maria Moran,
aka Tepepa .

682
01:25:49,774 --> 01:25:52,859
Are you sure
that we are talking about the same person?

683
01:25:54,904 --> 01:25:56,315
Yes.

684
01:25:58,366 --> 01:26:03,277
15 January 1910 , Morelos.
Hacienda of Juan de Gonzalvo Coruña.

685
01:26:03,371 --> 01:26:06,823
Testimony of
Eduardo Ordonez, Peon .

686
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:09,158
It was four o'clock in the afternoon.

687
01:26:09,252 --> 01:26:12,206
On that day we refused to work.

688
01:26:12,964 --> 01:26:16,333
The employer has not even paid us a little
 , which would have been enough ...

689
01:26:16,426 --> 01:26:20,720
for some corn.
for our children to buy.

690
01:26:20,805 --> 01:26:26,808
We had gathered in the yard ,
when the Hazienderos picked us up .

691
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:36,528
Let's go!

692
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:39,817
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

693
01:26:39,908 --> 01:26:41,485
Let's go!

694
01:26:42,744 --> 01:26:44,487
Line up!

695
01:26:58,551 --> 01:26:59,168
You .

696
01:27:00,345 --> 01:27:01,839
You .

697
01:27:02,555 --> 01:27:04,098
You .

698
01:27:05,058 --> 01:27:05,674
You .

699
01:27:06,976 --> 01:27:08,934
And you. Step forward !

700
01:27:24,661 --> 01:27:28,112
Miguel , the chief Haziendero said nothing.

701
01:27:28,206 --> 01:27:31,871
He sought only five of us from
and let her undress .

702
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:35,625
They always did that when they flogged us .

703
01:27:44,764 --> 01:27:48,548
Days earlier, one of our comrades
died of the lashes.

704
01:27:48,643 --> 01:27:50,636
Etc. . , Etc., etc.

705
01:27:51,312 --> 01:27:53,934
The rest is not interesting.

706
01:27:54,941 --> 01:27:56,270
Ah, that here already.

707
01:27:56,359 --> 01:27:59,526
Testimony of
Carlos Santa Maria , Peon .

708
01:28:00,196 --> 01:28:02,522
They had already whipped
the first four .

709
01:28:02,615 --> 01:28:07,740
Now, Juan was in turn ... etc. etc.
Not interesting.

710
01:28:08,830 --> 01:28:10,158
So ...

711
01:28:10,248 --> 01:28:12,704
Ah, here we have it .

712
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:17,668
Suddenly a gang of men on horses.

713
01:28:25,221 --> 01:28:26,003
The other!

714
01:28:26,097 --> 01:28:29,597
The one they called Tepepa shot first.

715
01:29:05,303 --> 01:29:06,963
Comrade ...

716
01:29:08,181 --> 01:29:09,675
Take this

717
01:29:10,642 --> 01:29:12,681
Land and Freedom.

718
01:29:13,311 --> 01:29:17,356
Testimony of
Vicente Moreno, accountant.

719
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:22,186
I saw Miguel die 
and I saw who killed him.

720
01:29:24,322 --> 01:29:27,489
I immediately rushed far away from
the employer's house

721
01:29:27,575 --> 01:29:31,620
Don Juan, Madero's men
have killed Miguel!

722
01:29:31,705 --> 01:29:34,278
No need to yell .
How many are there?

723
01:29:46,511 --> 01:29:51,932
Testimony of
Virgen Maria Escalante, domestic workers.

724
01:29:52,434 --> 01:29:55,103
I was in the room of Señorita Consuelo .

725
01:29:55,186 --> 01:29:59,599
She had just finished bathing
and I was there ...

726
01:29:59,691 --> 01:30:03,475
during drying her ...
and to assist in dressing.

727
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,160
Good day.

728
01:30:23,256 --> 01:30:26,376
All of a sudden he stood there .

729
01:30:40,899 --> 01:30:43,105
The daughter of the employer?

730
01:30:44,819 --> 01:30:46,397
Get out of here!

731
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:48,447
Why ?

732
01:30:51,034 --> 01:30:52,908
Am I dirty?

733
01:31:00,794 --> 01:31:02,454
Allow ?

734
01:31:28,196 --> 01:31:29,738
So ..

735
01:31:31,032 --> 01:31:32,657
And now ...

736
01:31:35,036 --> 01:31:36,661
Pig!

737
01:31:45,255 --> 01:31:46,879
Francisco.

738
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:53,083
Get her away .
The Old .

739
01:31:53,179 --> 01:31:55,338
No! No! No!

740
01:32:34,637 --> 01:32:36,215
Francisco ...

741
01:32:37,182 --> 01:32:39,009
I told you ,
you shall bring away the old .

742
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,511
Go!

743
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:08,622
Testimony of
Lieutenant Luis Siqueiros ...

744
01:33:08,713 --> 01:33:12,213
Police Commander ... of Coruña.

745
01:33:12,842 --> 01:33:17,718
Sorry, we could not do anything more
for  Señorita Consuelo de Coruña.

746
01:33:17,806 --> 01:33:21,009
When we arrived ,
it was too late .

747
01:33:42,664 --> 01:33:44,740
Señorita ! Señorita !

748
01:33:47,544 --> 01:33:49,702
That's all , Doctor.

749
01:33:51,256 --> 01:33:53,083
This is Tepepa .

750
01:33:54,926 --> 01:33:59,968
If you have any interest ,
would like to meet an agreement .

751
01:34:34,799 --> 01:34:38,299
Fresh fruit! Fresh fruit!

752
01:34:38,386 --> 01:34:41,138
- Good day .
- Go with God .

753
01:34:46,061 --> 01:34:47,804
Fresh fruit !

754
01:35:27,227 --> 01:35:29,469
Paquito !
What are you doing here?

755
01:35:29,562 --> 01:35:31,222
Come on .

756
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:44,243
My wives ...
Disappears !

757
01:36:06,016 --> 01:36:07,558
Sit down .

758
01:36:12,022 --> 01:36:14,691
- And your father ?
- He's dead

759
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:19,943
Oh, I'm sorry .
I know that many were killed .

760
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:22,984
Is it true
that someone has been spying ?

761
01:36:23,867 --> 01:36:25,361
No, that's not true.

762
01:36:25,452 --> 01:36:31,704
Well, that was told in the village so ...
And Tepepa , where is he now ?

763
01:36:31,791 --> 01:36:33,369
In the mountains .

764
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:35,499
In the mountains ?
And where?

765
01:36:35,587 --> 01:36:37,164
In the Sierra .

766
01:36:38,798 --> 01:36:40,707
Listen, my boy.

767
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,383
Tepepa and the other
are greedy for weapons.

768
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:48,634
For me Tepepa was always
a good customer , but nothing more.

769
01:36:48,725 --> 01:36:52,094
But for you it should
be something more important.

770
01:36:53,605 --> 01:36:57,389
Or have you become a friend to the police?

771
01:37:11,414 --> 01:37:12,992
Hey ...

772
01:37:14,417 --> 01:37:16,077
What a great thing !

773
01:37:16,169 --> 01:37:17,912
It is like a cannon.

774
01:37:18,004 --> 01:37:20,163
What a great thing !

775
01:37:27,263 --> 01:37:28,888
Señor Chu ...

776
01:37:30,392 --> 01:37:31,720
I would take them.

777
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:38,563
But how shall I ...
pay you ?

778
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:43,395
The boy has already paid.

779
01:37:53,707 --> 01:37:55,450
Thank you, Paquito .

780
01:37:57,502 --> 01:38:00,040
So you got us weapons bought with your money?

781
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:02,288
It was government money ,
not mine.

782
01:38:09,472 --> 01:38:11,963
And who told you ,
that it was government money ?

783
01:38:12,058 --> 01:38:13,552
Cascorro said it.

784
01:38:18,773 --> 01:38:23,352
Juan, grab a couple of men
and look around in the area.

785
01:38:23,445 --> 01:38:26,232
Alright, Tepepa .
Let's go !

786
01:38:30,326 --> 01:38:31,904
Paco ...

787
01:38:33,872 --> 01:38:36,908
- Where have you seen Cascorro ?
- With the Gringo .

788
01:38:47,761 --> 01:38:49,136
Juan !

789
01:38:51,139 --> 01:38:53,215
Come back!

790
01:38:58,605 --> 01:39:00,182
Listen ...

791
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:05,982
Load everything.
We must get away from here .

792
01:39:06,571 --> 01:39:08,564
Cascorro is coming .

793
01:39:10,241 --> 01:39:11,901
Hey Señor Chu ...

794
01:39:11,993 --> 01:39:13,653
Where are you going ?

795
01:39:14,037 --> 01:39:16,954
- Where are you going ?
- After Ciudad Juárez.

796
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,119
- You stay here .
- But ...

797
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:19,666
Go !

798
01:39:21,252 --> 01:39:23,044
Stand still!

799
01:39:23,129 --> 01:39:24,754
Compañeros !

800
01:39:28,551 --> 01:39:31,505
We will need lots of water .

801
01:39:31,596 --> 01:39:37,516
Take as much as you can ,
and do not waste a single drop .

802
01:40:50,133 --> 01:40:52,706
- Marieta ...
- Yes ?

803
01:40:55,305 --> 01:41:01,842
What is the most important thing for a human being ,
who wants to cross the desert ?

804
01:41:02,729 --> 01:41:03,642
Water.

805
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:09,021
And if someone has a
large water storage with him:

806
01:41:09,110 --> 01:41:13,108
- What does this mean?
- That he would like to cross the desert .

807
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,824
All right.

808
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:20,694
If you've come out
also Cascorro will come out .

809
01:41:21,331 --> 01:41:22,410
How ?

810
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:27,536
That's all what Señor Chu
could say.

811
01:41:27,629 --> 01:41:30,036
And if Señor Chu did not tell him?

812
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,918
He told him.

813
01:44:30,979 --> 01:44:32,093
Hold it!

814
01:44:33,857 --> 01:44:36,015
Stop!

815
01:44:56,212 --> 01:44:58,170
Captain , look .

816
01:45:16,149 --> 01:45:19,767
We have seen them.
You are in the desert, two miles from here .

817
01:45:19,861 --> 01:45:21,486
Colonel .

818
01:45:22,447 --> 01:45:23,645
Forward .

819
01:45:24,616 --> 01:45:27,949
Forward!

820
01:45:33,041 --> 01:45:35,614
Do you have a match, Doctor?

821
01:45:56,356 --> 01:45:57,980
I know .

822
01:45:58,650 --> 01:46:03,442
That was not part of the deal ,
but ... I can not take any chances .

823
01:47:07,802 --> 01:47:09,594
Stop!

824
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,469
Stop the engine.

825
01:47:57,018 --> 01:48:00,719
We have again the stupidity of Men .

826
01:48:01,648 --> 01:48:05,562
As soon as they hear sounds it
makes them worried.

827
01:48:06,361 --> 01:48:10,311
You realize that it is goats
and calm down.

828
01:48:12,242 --> 01:48:15,445
Just why are these goats there ?

829
01:48:16,079 --> 01:48:18,914
Think nothing of it.

830
01:48:20,709 --> 01:48:23,745
This is exactly worrying.

831
01:48:27,215 --> 01:48:30,299
Kill those women!
Shoot !

832
01:49:06,338 --> 01:49:08,579
Take cover !

833
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:27,183
Caution!

834
01:49:30,403 --> 01:49:33,570
Get off and turn on the engine.

835
01:49:56,429 --> 01:49:58,338
Now I kill that spy.

836
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:07,223
No, he is a prisoner .
Just see .

837
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:34,213
Damn bastards !

838
01:52:39,884 --> 01:52:41,343
On you!

839
01:55:21,129 --> 01:55:24,130
What is it, Colonel?
Is it broken?

840
01:55:29,637 --> 01:55:32,259
Good ... Get out ,
we need to go.

841
01:55:34,184 --> 01:55:35,761
Go ...

842
01:55:38,355 --> 01:55:39,220
Where?

843
01:55:39,314 --> 01:55:43,146
What we need to do
we can not do alone .

844
01:55:44,194 --> 01:55:49,105
Do you remember that you had your own ideas
regarding " land and liberty "?

845
01:55:49,699 --> 01:55:55,488
I'll take you to a place where you
can spread your ideas in front of people .

846
01:56:00,877 --> 01:56:06,298
Go straight , dear Colonel .
That does your buttocks well .

847
01:56:31,074 --> 01:56:32,734
Braves horse.

848
01:56:34,202 --> 01:56:36,989
Hey, careful , dear Colonel .

849
01:56:39,249 --> 01:56:40,992
Braves horse.

850
01:57:28,923 --> 01:57:30,548
There he is, compañeros .

851
01:57:30,633 --> 01:57:34,049
I have given you Colonel Cascorro personally


852
01:57:48,777 --> 01:57:50,935
- Are you seriously injured leader?
- Ei, ei, ei.

853
01:57:51,029 --> 01:57:52,820
I'll help you .

854
01:58:47,002 --> 01:58:48,661
Doctor ...

855
01:58:52,507 --> 01:58:54,583
Tepepa want to live .

856
01:58:55,844 --> 01:58:57,587
My God ...

857
01:58:58,221 --> 01:58:59,881
My God ...

858
01:59:00,473 --> 01:59:02,051
My God ...

859
01:59:02,726 --> 01:59:04,386
My God ...

860
01:59:05,270 --> 01:59:07,013
My God ...

861
01:59:13,194 --> 01:59:19,731
Mother, Mother, Mother,
Mother, Mother .

862
01:59:21,202 --> 01:59:22,910
Mother ...

863
01:59:22,996 --> 01:59:24,490
Caution ...

864
01:59:27,083 --> 01:59:28,661
Yes ...

865
01:59:28,752 --> 01:59:30,294
Doctor ...

866
01:59:31,755 --> 01:59:35,704
We must have the Señorita
to speak in Morelos.

867
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:38,885
<i> Señorita in Morelos ... </ i>

868
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:41,722
Look ...

869
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:47,053
We did not know at that time .

870
01:59:47,145 --> 01:59:49,019
How was I to know
that that was your Señorita ?

871
01:59:49,105 --> 01:59:51,513
Your <i> was ... </ i>

872
01:59:54,778 --> 01:59:58,312
I thought
that it would please her .

873
02:00:02,160 --> 02:00:03,903
Caution , Doctor.

874
02:00:06,081 --> 02:00:09,284
I have done nothing wrong .

875
02:00:10,627 --> 02:00:16,001
I've only done that,
what men make with women.

876
02:00:16,091 --> 02:00:18,332
That what you also did

877
02:00:18,426 --> 02:00:20,419
<i> too </ i> du ..

878
02:00:23,390 --> 02:00:27,683
Look, doctor ,
I would like to say that the women ...

879
02:00:28,186 --> 02:00:30,060
... all the same.

880
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:32,140
You are ...

881
02:00:33,316 --> 02:00:36,483
Well, they are all
cut from the same wood.

882
02:00:36,569 --> 02:00:37,399
Right?

883
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:48,405
But what is a girl
compared to the revolution?

884
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:56,790
Sorry .
I did not want ...

885
02:01:01,094 --> 02:01:03,550
Listen to me a moment to ...

886
02:01:05,265 --> 02:01:08,431
A doctor must not kill ,
right?

887
02:01:08,518 --> 02:01:10,345
Of course not .

888
02:01:11,146 --> 02:01:15,143
If someone has a PhD ...
he has to save one .

889
02:01:15,233 --> 02:01:17,605
A doctor must not kill .

890
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:21,728
That's for sure ...
That's for sure .

891
02:01:22,449 --> 02:01:24,737
A doctor has to save one .

892
02:01:26,202 --> 02:01:30,070
A doctor must save a ...
He has to save one .

893
02:01:30,165 --> 02:01:34,791
<i> He must rescue a ... </ i>
<i> He must rescue a ... </ i>

894
02:02:08,328 --> 02:02:09,988
How stupid .

895
02:02:10,580 --> 02:02:12,323
How stupid .

896
02:02:16,419 --> 02:02:18,578
Imagine Doctor ...

897
02:02:19,089 --> 02:02:21,247
you had me ...
killed because of a Señorita .

898
02:02:21,341 --> 02:02:26,217
<i> Because of a Señorita ... </ i>
<i> Because of a Señorita ... </ i>

899
02:02:26,304 --> 02:02:27,763
<i> Because of a Señorita ... </ i>

900
02:02:30,058 --> 02:02:31,801
Thank you, Doctor .

901
02:02:35,438 --> 02:02:37,597
Thank you, dear God .

902
02:03:04,134 --> 02:03:05,960
Whores ...

903
02:04:42,273 --> 02:04:43,898
He's dead

904
02:06:08,610 --> 02:06:10,234
