1
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:22,215
(clap of thunder)

2
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:21,913
(man shouts at horses)

3
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,591
(stage coach driver) 'Andale caballo'

4
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:45,352
'Andale caballo'

5
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:53,193
(shouts in Spanish)

6
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:06,247
'Señor'

7
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,834
'Señor'

8
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:12,337
'Señor'

9
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:16,883
- Tighten up that girth.
- Señor I must go to San Felipe.

10
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,552
My mother is dead!

11
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:22,263
Straight down the road about 50 miles.

12
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,612
Yeah get outta here.

13
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,918
Hey. Hey amigo

14
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,382
Come here.

15
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:26,074
Perfect.

16
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:29,411
You're perfect!

17
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:34,832
I swear to God boys he's just right.

18
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:42,673
I'm gonna put you on that stage and
watch those faces when they see you come in!

19
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:07,322
(both laugh)

20
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,659
v ovo

21
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:07,128
- By God I...
- Never mind dear.

22
00:07:42,037 --> 00:07:44,290
(tuts)

23
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:46,709
Over there.

24
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:04,851
Not that door the other one there.

25
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:07,520
Pull. Pull.

26
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:18,155
There you are. Now just sit down
and be quiet like a good little boy.

27
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:23,493
You see? He does understand.

28
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:26,538
Who knows perhaps he can even talk.

29
00:08:26,663 --> 00:08:31,376
Now now even the peasants...
A bit of mustard?

30
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:35,297
Thank you.
Even the peasants are entitled to their rights.

31
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:38,717
After all they have won a revolution.

32
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:40,468
Or at least almost.

33
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:43,596
Animals that's what they are. Animals.

34
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:45,348
(burps)

35
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:48,434
Even animals can be tame and harmless.

36
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,479
Personally I consider them unfortunate brutes.

37
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:54,065
Yes brutes. Quite right.

38
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,317
Precisely my dear lady precisely.

39
00:08:56,442 --> 00:09:00,988
I hate saying it
but you should hear them in the confessional.

40
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:05,742
- You would never imagine. Did you know...?
- I can imagine Father.

41
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,577
I can imagine.

42
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:11,081
Living in such promiscuity
all of them in one room

43
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:15,460
male and female together
lying in a heap like rats in a sewer.

44
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:20,215
At night when the lights are out
all their inibitions disappear.

45
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:27,096
You never know who is next:
mother sister daughter... goat.

46
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:29,348
Every country has its own plague.

47
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:37,523
- Just like them niggers we got back home.
- Just like animals. That's what they are.

48
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:41,443
Exactly. Which is why they're half-wits.

49
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:46,448
Hey you. Do you know who your father was?

50
00:09:50,702 --> 00:09:53,329
Do you know how old you are?

51
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,793
He doesn't know.

52
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:03,214
Do you know how many kids you have? Huh?

53
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,261
Do you know how many kids your mother had?

54
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:10,471
He doesn't know anything.

55
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:14,766
It was to benefit scum like this
that the Agrarian Reform was imposed.

56
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:23,775
And that ass Madero wanted to give
the government and our land to idiots like this.

57
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:26,820
We are all pawns in the hands of Almighty God.

58
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:30,949
Fortunately Divine Providence
has disposed of that rash individual Madero.

59
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:34,328
My dear Monsignor let us be realistic.

60
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:40,583
What you call Providence I call General Huerta.
He put the peasants in their place.

61
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:44,962
Which is the best place for animals
because that's what they are.

62
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:49,717
Animals.

63
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:51,469
(voices echo) I can imagine.

64
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:57,308
- I can imagine living in such promiscuity...
...wanted to give the government and our land

65
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:59,017
to idiots like this!

66
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:02,354
- Goats.
- Animals.

67
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:05,273
- Rats!
- Just like them niggers we got back home.

68
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,150
- Half-wits!
- Animals!

69
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:10,529
Divine Providence has disposed...

70
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:13,365
Just like them niggers.

71
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,619
Animals. Because that's what they are. Animals.

72
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,412
...like them niggers.
- Brutes!

73
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:21,914
That's what they are animals.

74
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,541
- Like them niggers.
- Brutes!

75
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,209
Animals!

76
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:27,878
- I consider them unfortunate brutes.
- I can imagine...

77
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:29,713
Niggers.

78
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:32,716
- Brutes!
- Niggers!

79
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:34,843
...like them niggers.
- Idiots!

80
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:36,637
- Niggers!
- Idiots!

81
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,640
...like them niggers.
- Idiots! Half-wits!

82
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,935
(driver) 'Anda caballo anda'

83
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,111
(driver) 'Anda caballo'

84
00:11:57,615 --> 00:12:00,952
Hey you give us a hand and push.

85
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:10,460
Think they'd get off their asses to help us
the bastards? Hell no!

86
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:15,465
'Anda' 'Caballo huyo'

87
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:23,056
(driver shouts horses neigh)

88
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:33,024
Haaaahh!

89
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,166
(gasps)

90
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:08,892
(cockerel crows)

91
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:50,306
Take him away before he dirties everything.

92
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:55,687
Now ladies and gentlemen you will give
everything to my niños without any trouble.

93
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:58,523
- We kill them all OK Papá?
- (gunshot)

94
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:03,777
I've told you Chulo
no shooting unless Papá pulls the trigger.

95
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,499
Come.

96
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,710
Come come come come!

97
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:22,838
(boys chatter in Spanish in background)

98
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:38,060
You wanted to know my family? That's my sons.

99
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:40,771
Each one of them from a different mother.

100
00:14:40,897 --> 00:14:42,815
And now you kneel.

101
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,400
Kneel!

102
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:46,194
Kneel!

103
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,820
'Papá'

104
00:14:51,406 --> 00:14:53,950
This is my father. I think.

105
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:57,621
- Pleased to meet...
- Go inside before Chulo kills everyone.

106
00:14:58,663 --> 00:15:03,543
My mother had the blood of the Aztecs
which was before your people.

107
00:15:08,423 --> 00:15:11,467
And now I ask you a question.

108
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:13,677
Can you make a baby?

109
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:17,056
Can you make a baby?

110
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:21,435
That's sad. But we will fix that.

111
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:26,607
'Señora'

112
00:15:26,732 --> 00:15:29,527
(Adelita) Let me go! Let go.

113
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,333
Go on.

114
00:15:49,003 --> 00:15:50,755
Go.

115
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,475
(cow moos)

116
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:10,732
(whistles)

117
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:18,490
- Go... go... go... go... go!
- (Adelita screams)

118
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:20,700
(gasps)

119
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:58,403
(cockerel crows)

120
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:26,096
Pretty good huh?

121
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:41,543
Oh Jesus help me I'm going to faint.

122
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:49,301
No no no no no.
You faint now and you miss the best part.

123
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:51,928
(chatter and laughter)

124
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:01,229
Juanito you get everything?

125
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:06,442
You'll pay for this you bastard!

126
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:11,906
- I'm a citizen of the United States of America!
- You're an American son of a bitch.

127
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:13,949
Understand Yankee?

128
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:36,221
(chuckles)

129
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:38,264
Thank you.

130
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:12,547
Thank you. For everything.

131
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:18,302
(all gasp)

132
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,013
(laughter)

133
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,775
(horses whinny)

134
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:26,342
(all laugh)

135
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,481
Have you a light?

136
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:46,935
There is a hole in the roof.

137
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,318
Hey!

138
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,621
(gun barrels click)

139
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,423
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Why?

140
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:36,398
You pull that trigger and shoot me I fall.

141
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:53,540
And if I fall they'll have to alter all the maps.

142
00:26:15,686 --> 00:26:20,066
You see when I go
half this bloody country goes with me.

143
00:26:20,857 --> 00:26:23,318
Including yourself.

144
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:55,349
(laughs)

145
00:27:03,774 --> 00:27:08,695
- You understand now?
- Ah sí sí sí sí sí sí I understand.

146
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,738
'Sí

147
00:27:10,864 --> 00:27:15,034
It's like a miracle of God.
You you are a great magician.

148
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,914
I stop your motorcycle
you do the magic with my coach. We are even.

149
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,208
- Even?
- Sí

150
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:29,882
To fix my motorcycle would be even.

151
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:34,303
I'll be inside.

152
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:43,061
Oh! We kill him now Papá?

153
00:27:43,187 --> 00:27:46,565
No. First we fix the motorcycle. Shh!

154
00:28:00,786 --> 00:28:05,082
- It's whisky.
- Thank God for that huh?

155
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:08,419
Where are you going in this contraption?

156
00:28:08,544 --> 00:28:11,297
Well... Where are you going?

157
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:16,092
- Shaver Mines.
- Oh-ho.

158
00:28:16,218 --> 00:28:19,095
Lucanina huh? I know that place.

159
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:23,558
I know the man who owns it
that fat German son of a bitch!

160
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:28,313
That crazy tub of lard Mr Aschenbach
who wrings our people dry like slaves

161
00:28:28,438 --> 00:28:31,191
even his personal servants.
One girl had an ass:

162
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:35,654
her cheek s were hard like drums.
I got her pregnant and he...

163
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:40,699
Oh Jesus Christ!
Will you shut up and go and fix my motorcycle?

164
00:28:43,244 --> 00:28:45,246
OK.

165
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:47,957
OK.

166
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:51,836
Anything you say Firecracker.

167
00:28:55,714 --> 00:28:57,800
(all shout at once)

168
00:29:00,427 --> 00:29:03,221
(Juan) Take your hands off that. Now!

169
00:29:45,596 --> 00:29:47,764
(laughs)

170
00:29:48,514 --> 00:29:51,017
Well good for you Firecracker.

171
00:29:54,812 --> 00:30:01,152
I don't know why I named you Napoleon
when you have no imagination. This is a bank!

172
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:05,031
- Mesa Verde
- Sí Papá Mesa Verde. Mesa Verde.

173
00:30:05,156 --> 00:30:09,994
If we can get this Firecracker to come with us
we will be rich.

174
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:13,663
Where does he come in?
The dynamite's right here.

175
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:17,209
No no. You need an expert for that.

176
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:22,047
You only need matches and balls.
And I got those.

177
00:30:22,172 --> 00:30:24,257
- ¿ Sí?
- 'Sí

178
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:32,390
See that tree over there?

179
00:30:54,537 --> 00:30:56,664
(explosion)

180
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,044
Short fuse.

181
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:28,652
Now you understand
why we need the firecracker?

182
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:31,321
Huh?

183
00:33:18,215 --> 00:33:23,637
- Where the hell are we?
- What kind of work you do for the German?

184
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:29,393
Listen I asked you a question.
What do you do for the German?

185
00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:33,772
- I've been looking for silver for him.
- Silver?

186
00:33:33,897 --> 00:33:36,692
You know something? I don't understand you.

187
00:33:36,817 --> 00:33:43,656
Why do you waste your time and your holy water
looking for silver? To me that's a sin.

188
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:50,955
- Have you any better ideas?
- Sí Gold is better than silver.

189
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,583
There isn't any gold in these hills.

190
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:55,960
(laughs) Yes there is.

191
00:33:56,085 --> 00:33:58,337
In Mesa Verde.

192
00:34:05,135 --> 00:34:09,306
Of course.
Whoever heard of having a bank in the country!

193
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:14,811
Uh-huh. A bank?

194
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,025
Not a bank. The bank.

195
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:28,866
The most beautiful wonderful fantastic
gorgeous magnificent bank in the world.

196
00:34:28,991 --> 00:34:31,702
When you stand before the bank

197
00:34:31,827 --> 00:34:36,957
and you see it has the gates of gold
like it was the gates of heaven.

198
00:34:37,082 --> 00:34:42,838
And when you go inside
everything everything is gold.

199
00:34:42,963 --> 00:34:45,966
Gold spittoons gold handles. And money.

200
00:34:49,552 --> 00:34:54,974
I know 'cause I saw when I was
eight years old. I went there with my father.

201
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:59,938
He tried to rob the bank. They caught him
but they won't catch me. ¿ Eh Papá?

202
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:01,439
Right.

203
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:04,567
Listen Firecracker you listen to me.

204
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,615
Listen why don't you come with me

205
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,367
and we will work together?

206
00:35:14,618 --> 00:35:17,579
And we will become rich.

207
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,543
(laughs)

208
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,921
What the hell is your name?

209
00:35:27,131 --> 00:35:29,216
John.

210
00:35:29,341 --> 00:35:31,426
What?

211
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:35,054
John.

212
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:41,269
- What is your name?
- John.

213
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:45,273
(Juan laughs) That's fantastic. That is incredible.

214
00:35:45,398 --> 00:35:48,943
My name is Juan and yours is John.
Juan and John.

215
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:50,820
So what?

216
00:35:50,945 --> 00:35:54,782
Can't you understand that is that is the...

217
00:35:54,907 --> 00:35:56,950
Oh...

218
00:35:57,075 --> 00:35:59,077
Destiny.

219
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,297
No. And I mean it.

220
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,341
Why?

221
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:45,555
You want more money? I'll give you more
than half. I don't care about the money.

222
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,474
As long as we can work together.

223
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,601
Listen what I'm telling you.

224
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,394
We are like two brothers.

225
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:59,025
You make the holes with the holy water
and then I walk in and do the dirty work.

226
00:37:59,776 --> 00:38:03,488
Listen it takes one bandito to know another.

227
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:19,003
(laughs)

228
00:38:25,593 --> 00:38:28,345
- So you can read?
- You don't have to read.

229
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:34,185
I see a man's picture I see a price
I know that man is in trouble.

230
00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:43,610
Hey what kind of trouble are you in?

231
00:38:48,782 --> 00:38:54,412
- Oh we fought a revolution in Ireland.
- A revolution?

232
00:38:54,537 --> 00:38:58,082
Seems revolutions are all over the world
like the crops.

233
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:01,211
We had a revolution.
The brave people went in.

234
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:08,217
What it did to them was terrible. Pancho Villa
the world's best bandit chief two balls like a bull

235
00:39:08,342 --> 00:39:13,430
he went in the revolution as a great bandit
came out as what? Nothing.

236
00:39:13,555 --> 00:39:17,142
A general. That to me is the bullshit.

237
00:39:18,852 --> 00:39:21,188
(begins to kick-start motorcycle)

238
00:39:21,313 --> 00:39:26,234
Wait a minute.
You come here to join the revolution?

239
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:30,363
No no.

240
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,784
One was enough for me.

241
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:36,786
(motorcycle revs up)

242
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:43,751
Stop! You dirty...

243
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:46,754
...son of a bitch!

244
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:49,172
Gringo... bastard!

245
00:39:52,175 --> 00:39:53,593
(gunshot)

246
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:55,470
(hissing)

247
00:39:55,595 --> 00:39:57,848
(squeaking)

248
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:43,907
Hey!

249
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:51,748
Duck, you sucker!

250
00:43:02,191 --> 00:43:07,196
- Say which way is it to Lucanina?
- Fuck you! Go find it yourself!

251
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:13,118
Mexico is big
but for you it is going to be very big!

252
00:43:13,911 --> 00:43:15,661
(Juan's voice echoes)

253
00:44:05,459 --> 00:44:07,795
(distant laughter)

254
00:44:58,594 --> 00:45:02,139
(clatter of hooves horse whinnies)

255
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:08,145
(Juan) John where are you? It's us!

256
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:15,985
Come on come on you.

257
00:45:20,948 --> 00:45:23,284
Come on in there.

258
00:45:23,409 --> 00:45:26,996
Just a little further inside.

259
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:30,750
That's right heathen bastards.

260
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:35,921
What's this?
You crazy? You talk to yourself now?

261
00:45:36,046 --> 00:45:40,050
Oh my friend didn't I tell you Mexico was big?

262
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:46,056
Oh shit.

263
00:45:47,015 --> 00:45:48,892
Who are those people inside?

264
00:45:50,018 --> 00:45:53,647
You mean who were those people inside?

265
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:06,033
(explosion resounds)

266
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:22,257
Who were they? Who were those people inside?

267
00:46:22,382 --> 00:46:24,092
(Juan) Chulo!

268
00:46:28,805 --> 00:46:31,766
Who were those people for Christ's sake?

269
00:46:31,891 --> 00:46:37,397
Well one of them was Aschenbach
then there was three soldiers and one captain.

270
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:40,275
Everybody dead in there.

271
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,236
Will you keep quiet
and go get our friend's equipment together?

272
00:46:45,529 --> 00:46:51,535
Anyway when I went to Aschenbach
and I told him

273
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:55,831
I said you wanted to see him
he wouldn't believe that.

274
00:46:55,956 --> 00:46:59,293
I said "That's too bad
because he's discovered silver."

275
00:46:59,418 --> 00:47:01,462
Then he was ready to come running.

276
00:47:01,587 --> 00:47:07,008
The other one the captain... I think the captain
and Aschenbach were working together.

277
00:47:07,133 --> 00:47:10,052
The captain says "I want to see the man."

278
00:47:10,178 --> 00:47:17,560
I said "How can you see him? He's blown off
his hand with dynamite he is bleeding to death."

279
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:22,064
When they heard that
they broke their asses to get here.

280
00:47:22,982 --> 00:47:27,570
Anyway it's no problem because
there are diamonds here no questions.

281
00:47:27,695 --> 00:47:32,073
Also you have no contract so... you are free.

282
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:34,201
(Juan laughs)

283
00:47:34,326 --> 00:47:37,621
There will be one little problem with the army.

284
00:47:37,746 --> 00:47:43,001
They will have a hot ass
when it comes to the death of a captain.

285
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:47,089
But don't worry.
I am your friend Juan and I will help.

286
00:47:47,214 --> 00:47:49,591
I will do anything say anything...

287
00:47:49,716 --> 00:47:55,262
No no no. I don't need any help from you
to know I've been screwed.

288
00:47:57,014 --> 00:47:59,141
You fuckin' chicken thief.

289
00:48:07,024 --> 00:48:09,485
What do you want with me?

290
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,740
Nothing.

291
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:18,326
I just thought that maybe...

292
00:48:19,035 --> 00:48:23,164
...we could go to Mesa Verde.

293
00:48:26,334 --> 00:48:27,627
(chuckles)

294
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:32,340
The bank. Isn't there anything else
you remember about Mesa Verde?

295
00:48:32,465 --> 00:48:36,761
Yes there's a place
where you can sit down and eat.

296
00:48:36,886 --> 00:48:39,847
- When you look in front you...
- See the bank.

297
00:48:39,972 --> 00:48:42,224
That's right. How do you know?

298
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:47,438
Listen Mesa Verde that's only the beginning.

299
00:48:47,563 --> 00:48:54,486
Let me tell you it will be Juan and John
the two especialistas in bank s eh?

300
00:48:56,488 --> 00:49:00,159
We'll call it Johnny and Johnny.
That's more American.

301
00:49:00,284 --> 00:49:03,953
Amigo we go to America
there are bank s all over the place.

302
00:49:04,078 --> 00:49:07,707
In California Colorado
Kansas City Texas and Austin.

303
00:49:07,832 --> 00:49:12,837
You have to think of the big future
that we have ahead of us.

304
00:49:12,962 --> 00:49:15,923
I'm thinking of the big train behind us.

305
00:49:16,048 --> 00:49:19,177
Hey! Out of the way!

306
00:49:19,302 --> 00:49:21,387
(horn blasts)

307
00:51:11,242 --> 00:51:13,703
(horn blasts)

308
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:10,757
(train wheels screech)

309
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,579
(train chuffs)

310
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,098
Hey you.

311
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:05,727
I know that face.

312
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:09,063
Where have I seen you before?

313
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,302
(conductor) Stop right where you are!

314
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,686
Drop that knife you bastard.

315
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,608
(knife drops)

316
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,785
I have family.

317
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,967
(laughs)

318
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:27,554
I have a family too.

319
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:29,223
(conductor screams)

320
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:05,883
(train wheels screech)

321
00:55:37,413 --> 00:55:39,498
(train horn blasts)

322
00:55:44,211 --> 00:55:46,297
(hubbub of conversation)

323
00:56:23,624 --> 00:56:26,043
Beautiful eh?

324
00:56:32,216 --> 00:56:40,015
'Uno dos uno dos uno dos'
'Pelotón izquierda'

325
00:56:42,101 --> 00:56:44,894
'Uno dos uno dos uno dos'

326
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:52,902
'Uno dos uno dos uno dos'

327
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,658
(officer shouts in Spanish)

328
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,687
¿ Tienen algo qué pedir?

329
00:57:46,078 --> 00:57:48,539
¿ Y tu?

330
00:58:04,512 --> 00:58:06,347
(shouts orders in Spanish)

331
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:11,770
Listos

332
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:21,195
(orders continue)

333
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,696
'Armas'

334
00:58:29,244 --> 00:58:30,746
'Preparen'

335
00:58:30,871 --> 00:58:32,956
(gun barrels click)

336
00:58:37,419 --> 00:58:39,504
Apunten

337
00:58:44,217 --> 00:58:47,345
- 'Fuego'
- (gunshots)

338
00:58:55,603 --> 00:58:57,688
(gunshot)

339
00:58:57,814 --> 00:59:01,358
Hey God you're sure this is Mesa Verde?

340
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:48,294
Do you have your beans with chilli?

341
01:00:48,419 --> 01:00:50,880
I don't want nothing from you.

342
01:00:51,005 --> 01:00:54,884
- Aw come on have some beans.
- Listen you son of a bitch!

343
01:00:55,009 --> 01:00:59,179
You pull that trick on me again
I break your goddamn head!

344
01:01:00,847 --> 01:01:03,225
Well for Christ's sake.

345
01:01:04,476 --> 01:01:06,812
A train comes along and I take it.

346
01:01:06,937 --> 01:01:11,400
- Been waiting in your Mesa Verde ever since.
- It's not my Mesa Verde.

347
01:01:11,525 --> 01:01:16,696
- This place is covered with soldiers like flies.
- Just the way we like it.

348
01:01:17,322 --> 01:01:20,157
Just the way we like it?

349
01:01:23,202 --> 01:01:27,623
If it's a revolution... it's confusion.

350
01:01:27,748 --> 01:01:29,834
(mouths silently)

351
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:16,378
What are you talking about?
Revolution confusion?

352
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:22,551
Where there's confusion
a man who knows what he wants...

353
01:02:22,676 --> 01:02:27,306
...stands a good chance of getting it.
- I don't understand you.

354
01:02:36,105 --> 01:02:37,607
This him?

355
01:02:42,403 --> 01:02:44,489
That's him.

356
01:02:49,577 --> 01:02:51,620
Him who?

357
01:02:51,745 --> 01:02:54,039
- Do you trust me?
- No.

358
01:02:54,164 --> 01:02:57,417
- You want to get inside there?
- Sí

359
01:02:57,542 --> 01:03:02,672
Well I'm going to see to it
you have that chance. Come on.

360
01:03:14,267 --> 01:03:16,352
(man groans)

361
01:03:20,606 --> 01:03:22,483
(man shrieks)

362
01:03:22,608 --> 01:03:25,861
(doctor) Don't move goddamn it!
Hold him still.

363
01:03:32,326 --> 01:03:34,412
(man shrieks)

364
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:43,586
(man gasps and groans)

365
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:55,348
(man screams)

366
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:03,313
That does it. Relax now. Relax.

367
01:04:05,065 --> 01:04:06,734
It's all over.

368
01:04:07,818 --> 01:04:13,574
If you'd let this infection go any longer
your widow would be paying my bill.

369
01:04:15,576 --> 01:04:17,661
(old man coughs)

370
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:22,124
Mallory!

371
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:25,960
You've hardly joined us here in Mesa Verde.

372
01:04:26,836 --> 01:04:29,589
Already you're front-page news.

373
01:04:31,924 --> 01:04:34,135
"Irish dynamiter wanted for murder."

374
01:04:40,808 --> 01:04:43,811
You have a real talent for making friends.

375
01:04:43,936 --> 01:04:48,065
(chuckles) You've stirred up a hornet's nest.

376
01:04:50,275 --> 01:04:52,402
I'll grant you the captain but...

377
01:04:52,527 --> 01:04:57,366
...till now nobody dared
take a crack at foreign capitalists.

378
01:04:58,533 --> 01:05:00,827
Not even Pancho Villa.

379
01:05:01,745 --> 01:05:07,084
It seems even His Majesty's Secret Service
would like to get their hands on you.

380
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:11,796
And yet you are an asset to us.

381
01:05:12,463 --> 01:05:16,217
Even if sometimes you do drink a bit too much.

382
01:05:16,342 --> 01:05:18,594
Who says I drink too much?

383
01:05:20,054 --> 01:05:21,722
Your liver does.

384
01:05:21,847 --> 01:05:24,392
What about that one him?

385
01:05:25,476 --> 01:05:27,436
He's all right.

386
01:05:27,561 --> 01:05:30,898
Except that when operating
he cuts deeper than I do.

387
01:05:31,941 --> 01:05:36,611
What the doctor means is
one time we did a little work together.

388
01:05:37,654 --> 01:05:40,031
And now to our work friends.

389
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,285
I have good news.

390
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:50,208
In two days Villa and Zapata
will attack simultaneously from north and south.

391
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:52,502
(man coughs)

392
01:05:52,627 --> 01:05:57,631
We here like those in other cities
must begin parallel actions of harassment.

393
01:05:57,756 --> 01:06:00,843
Pereto's downfall is just a question of week s.

394
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:06,765
Whereas Miguel's is only a question of hours
if he doesn't stop smoking.

395
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:09,393
Easy to say.

396
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:17,609
We'll attack in four places at the same time.
Antonio you hit the city hall and old prisons.

397
01:06:17,735 --> 01:06:23,239
You will need to divide into two groups
one of them under the command of José.

398
01:06:23,364 --> 01:06:28,161
Jesús the railway station
and the marshalling yards as planned right?

399
01:06:28,286 --> 01:06:32,790
Get in position in good time in small groups
so you won't attract attention.

400
01:06:32,915 --> 01:06:36,335
And act like ordinary travellers
or railroad employees.

401
01:06:36,461 --> 01:06:41,841
You Manolo together with Juanito will attack
the army barrack s with our main forces agreed?

402
01:06:42,883 --> 01:06:49,514
This is their point of maximum concentration
and is the key to the success of our plan.

403
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:53,185
You must create
the impression of a massive attack.

404
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:56,980
And if necessary
be prepared to make the final sacrifice.

405
01:06:57,898 --> 01:07:01,735
The fourth and last target
Ortega the post office.

406
01:07:03,278 --> 01:07:07,156
When the enemy is busy on four fronts

407
01:07:07,281 --> 01:07:09,825
we'll move against our real objective.

408
01:07:10,785 --> 01:07:13,204
Do we still agree?

409
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:19,543
- You'll need men.
- I only need one man.

410
01:07:21,379 --> 01:07:23,464
One?

411
01:07:23,589 --> 01:07:25,633
Sí

412
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,385
Him?

413
01:07:30,136 --> 01:07:32,263
Him? Him?

414
01:07:32,389 --> 01:07:38,103
What is with this "him"? Him who? Who him?
To do what? That's what I want to know!

415
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:40,855
To attack the bank.

416
01:07:42,482 --> 01:07:45,235
The bank?

417
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,113
We will take care of the bank.

418
01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:51,699
That's why we're here
so don't worry about that.

419
01:07:53,992 --> 01:07:56,495
Well then what can I say?

420
01:07:57,204 --> 01:08:00,499
Except... I hope you make it.

421
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,877
Me too. And him.

422
01:08:05,504 --> 01:08:10,509
Well we'll meet again tonight to discuss details.
I have to go now.

423
01:08:10,634 --> 01:08:16,139
I left a woman in labour
and she can't wait till the revolution is over.

424
01:08:16,264 --> 01:08:18,057
(all laugh)

425
01:08:18,933 --> 01:08:22,687
- Tierra y libertad
- (all) 'Tierra y libertad'

426
01:08:23,312 --> 01:08:27,442
Leave one at a time and keep out of sight.

427
01:08:27,567 --> 01:08:29,694
Speaking of sight how's your cataract?

428
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:33,239
At least I have a good eye. With the other...

429
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:36,492
Shh! You don't have to say anything.

430
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:40,912
I understand everything.

431
01:08:41,621 --> 01:08:44,207
'Tierra y libertad'

432
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,502
Y libertad

433
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:10,873
(rapid gunfire)

434
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,918
(shouting)

435
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:18,256
'Capitán' 'Aviselas Capitán'

436
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:21,384
'Pronto' 'Hola muénvase'

437
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,555
(gunfire continues)

438
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:45,407
Go.

439
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,869
Psst psst! 'Oye'

440
01:10:50,787 --> 01:10:53,123
(gunfire and explosions)

441
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,542
Bravo Chulo.

442
01:11:00,212 --> 01:11:02,548
Take it take it.

443
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:06,886
(gunfire explosions shouting in Spanish)

444
01:11:14,977 --> 01:11:19,981
There must be a lot of money in the bank
look at all those soldiers.

445
01:11:25,862 --> 01:11:30,367
- You know how this work s?
- Sí It's a...

446
01:11:31,409 --> 01:11:33,495
...short fuse.

447
01:11:34,537 --> 01:11:36,623
- No.
- No?

448
01:11:37,665 --> 01:11:39,584
Normal rate.

449
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:41,586
30 seconds.

450
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:45,673
Sí 30 seconds.

451
01:12:29,339 --> 01:12:31,425
(man shrieks)

452
01:12:50,068 --> 01:12:54,155
- What did you find?
- Nothing but scrap paper.

453
01:12:57,575 --> 01:13:00,953
Wait a minute. Hey it's pointing down there.

454
01:13:01,078 --> 01:13:03,914
(gunshot)

455
01:13:17,093 --> 01:13:18,595
Psst!

456
01:14:29,579 --> 01:14:31,665
(gunshot resounds)

457
01:14:45,512 --> 01:14:47,680
(gunshot)

458
01:14:59,108 --> 01:15:00,735
(gunshot)

459
01:15:01,777 --> 01:15:03,404
(gunshot)

460
01:15:39,521 --> 01:15:41,607
There is the safe!

461
01:16:08,466 --> 01:16:10,551
Duck, you suckers

462
01:16:50,423 --> 01:16:55,928
- Where are you going for Christ's sake?
- I don't know but something's wrong.

463
01:16:56,053 --> 01:16:59,974
I went into the bank.
There's no money there nothing.

464
01:17:00,099 --> 01:17:04,353
The bank and the money were transferred
to Mexico City a month ago.

465
01:17:04,478 --> 01:17:08,523
They've been using this place
for a political prison ever since.

466
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:10,817
(laughs)

467
01:17:10,942 --> 01:17:15,071
- What? A political prison?
- I never said a thing about money.

468
01:17:15,196 --> 01:17:18,658
All I asked was if you wanted to get inside.

469
01:17:18,783 --> 01:17:22,412
But this bank is my life this is my dream.

470
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:30,502
The reality is you've just liberated 150 patriots
through sheer courage in the face of danger.

471
01:17:32,588 --> 01:17:35,007
(laughs)

472
01:17:35,132 --> 01:17:37,217
(crowds shout in distance)

473
01:17:38,177 --> 01:17:40,554
Ah yes...

474
01:17:42,931 --> 01:17:46,226
...you're a grand hero of the revolution now.

475
01:17:47,603 --> 01:17:51,773
- ¡ Vivela Juan!
- I don't want to be a hero. I want the money!

476
01:17:51,898 --> 01:17:53,608
The money!

477
01:17:54,651 --> 01:17:58,321
- You taught me one thing.
- What?

478
01:17:59,113 --> 01:18:01,616
How to get fucked!

479
01:19:09,597 --> 01:19:11,683
(man sings softly)

480
01:19:28,657 --> 01:19:32,077
- What's that?
- It's a map.

481
01:19:35,247 --> 01:19:38,083
It's your country you're lying all over.

482
01:19:39,376 --> 01:19:44,173
Not my country.
My country is me and my family.

483
01:19:44,298 --> 01:19:46,966
Well your country's also Huerta...

484
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,094
...and the Governor and landlords.

485
01:19:50,887 --> 01:19:53,431
And Gunther Ruiz and his locusts.

486
01:19:54,474 --> 01:19:57,185
- This little revolution we're having here.
- Revolution?

487
01:19:57,310 --> 01:20:02,607
Please don't try to tell me about revolution!
I know how revolutions start.

488
01:20:02,732 --> 01:20:07,028
People that read book s
go to people that don't read book s and say

489
01:20:07,153 --> 01:20:09,404
- "The time has come for change."
- Shh!

490
01:20:09,529 --> 01:20:12,282
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shit shush!

491
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:17,037
I know what I'm talking about
when I'm talking about revolutions!

492
01:20:17,162 --> 01:20:22,584
The people who read book s go to the people
who can't read and say "We need change"

493
01:20:22,709 --> 01:20:24,961
so the poor people make the change.

494
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:30,926
The people who read the book s sit around
big polished tables and talk and talk and eat.

495
01:20:31,051 --> 01:20:34,095
But what has happened to the poor people?

496
01:20:34,929 --> 01:20:37,223
They are dead!

497
01:20:39,308 --> 01:20:41,394
That's your revolution.

498
01:20:48,442 --> 01:20:50,403
Shh.

499
01:20:50,528 --> 01:20:54,824
So please don't tell me about revolutions.

500
01:21:06,001 --> 01:21:09,504
Then what happens?
The same fucking thing starts all over again!

501
01:21:51,419 --> 01:21:53,880
'Capitán'

502
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:10,771
'Vamos'

503
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:23,283
(sighs)

504
01:22:25,535 --> 01:22:27,745
I don't like it either.

505
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:33,959
Only Gunther Ruiz is less than 20 miles
from here on the road that leads to that bridge.

506
01:22:34,085 --> 01:22:37,129
They will comb the area bush by bush.

507
01:22:37,254 --> 01:22:41,592
So the order is to pull back
hide in the San Ysidro caves.

508
01:22:41,717 --> 01:22:43,803
Oh that's a brilliant order.

509
01:22:46,013 --> 01:22:48,015
Here we are facing it.

510
01:22:49,058 --> 01:22:53,812
You and the rest of you dreamers
want to piss it up against the wall!

511
01:22:53,937 --> 01:22:56,356
Not everybody can fight.

512
01:22:56,481 --> 01:22:58,900
There are those who must organise
co-ordinate.

513
01:22:59,025 --> 01:23:01,111
Yes yes of course.

514
01:23:03,738 --> 01:23:06,032
Yeah well...

515
01:23:06,157 --> 01:23:08,243
...don't pay any attention to me.

516
01:23:09,452 --> 01:23:12,163
It's personal.

517
01:23:22,756 --> 01:23:25,551
Sorry about those orders. I'm staying.

518
01:23:27,261 --> 01:23:29,930
I don't give a fuck about your revolutions.

519
01:23:30,055 --> 01:23:35,311
I'm tired of running up and down these
mountains and getting nowhere so I've stopped.

520
01:23:35,436 --> 01:23:38,730
Right here at the bridge of San Jorge.

521
01:23:41,441 --> 01:23:46,029
Maybe it's out of spite for you
and your slow dream or maybe...

522
01:23:47,947 --> 01:23:50,491
Ah maybe my feet are sore.

523
01:24:08,383 --> 01:24:14,431
'Hombres' Me and irlandés are gonna catch
ourselves a couple of fucking locusts.

524
01:24:14,556 --> 01:24:15,807
(commotion)

525
01:24:15,932 --> 01:24:19,561
'Atente' You go back and hide in the grotto.

526
01:24:19,686 --> 01:24:23,731
If things go bad here every man for himself.

527
01:24:23,856 --> 01:24:26,734
You move your asses! ¿ Comprenden?

528
01:24:28,527 --> 01:24:30,363
(men shout)

529
01:24:58,598 --> 01:25:03,895
If something happens
and your father doesn't come back

530
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:08,525
then I pray that the great God in heaven
takes care of you.

531
01:25:33,298 --> 01:25:37,135
Well... Good luck.

532
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:38,928
Thank you.

533
01:25:59,948 --> 01:26:02,159
(men shout)

534
01:26:02,284 --> 01:26:07,497
Listen when they are out of sight
we will make a run for it. ¿ SÍ?

535
01:26:15,172 --> 01:26:21,177
No? You can't mean to stay here? All those
explosions must have gone to your head!

536
01:26:25,014 --> 01:26:28,684
Remember John and Juan?

537
01:26:30,186 --> 01:26:31,979
America.

538
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:34,815
The millions.

539
01:26:37,985 --> 01:26:39,570
No.

540
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:44,658
I don't understand!
Wasn't that was a trick for us to get out?

541
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:49,746
- What can we do against those locusts?
- You'd be doing me a favour if you'd leave.

542
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:55,961
If I had a choice between a chicken thief
and ridding the world of a few uniforms

543
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:58,380
I'd not choose the chicken thief.

544
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:02,717
OK.

545
01:27:06,053 --> 01:27:07,930
OK.

546
01:27:09,223 --> 01:27:10,933
No!

547
01:27:11,058 --> 01:27:13,185
(laughs)

548
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:16,814
Oh no no. You will like that huh?

549
01:27:17,606 --> 01:27:24,530
Well you listen to me you Irish piece of shit!

550
01:27:25,197 --> 01:27:30,118
You think you're the only man
with the balls to stay? You are wrong!

551
01:27:30,243 --> 01:27:33,746
I have the balls and I stay.

552
01:27:53,015 --> 01:27:57,728
He says there's no danger
just watch the bridge from a long way.

553
01:27:58,937 --> 01:28:03,984
No matter how I look with them
I'm still too close to the bridge.

554
01:28:05,027 --> 01:28:08,280
Why am I mixed up in this revolution anyway?

555
01:28:08,405 --> 01:28:14,493
God why didn't you strike me down
instead of letting me say "I stay too"?

556
01:28:15,453 --> 01:28:19,290
Oh look at him! All because of him.

557
01:28:19,415 --> 01:28:22,293
He acts like a tourist only he's staying.

558
01:28:22,418 --> 01:28:24,920
(laughs) Look at him.

559
01:28:25,046 --> 01:28:27,757
What the hell does he care?

560
01:28:27,882 --> 01:28:30,343
He is having fun.

561
01:28:30,468 --> 01:28:35,014
I'm glad he's having fun God
because I am not having fun.

562
01:28:35,139 --> 01:28:37,265
Oh-ho no.

563
01:28:41,019 --> 01:28:42,270
Hey...

564
01:28:43,647 --> 01:28:46,024
What's this?

565
01:28:50,695 --> 01:28:52,989
Now he goes to sleep huh?

566
01:28:53,531 --> 01:28:57,160
Go ahead you sleep sleep.

567
01:28:57,953 --> 01:29:01,956
I tell you something when he's asleep I'll go.
Shh!

568
01:29:19,098 --> 01:29:21,183
(laughs)

569
01:29:54,798 --> 01:29:56,967
Stop over there Sergeant.

570
01:30:25,911 --> 01:30:27,788
Hey!

571
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:35,795
God only an idiot could sleep at a time like this!

572
01:30:40,133 --> 01:30:41,760
Hey!

573
01:30:54,356 --> 01:30:57,316
(clatter of hooves)

574
01:31:41,525 --> 01:31:43,610
(clicks)

575
01:31:46,613 --> 01:31:48,699
(gun rattles)

576
01:32:16,058 --> 01:32:20,104
Abandon the truck s!
Break rank s and take cover under the bridge!

577
01:32:20,229 --> 01:32:23,357
Artillery fire. The bridge!

578
01:32:23,482 --> 01:32:25,443
(gunfire continues)

579
01:32:43,918 --> 01:32:46,463
(gunfire persists)

580
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:23,414
(gunfire ceases)

581
01:37:44,331 --> 01:37:46,625
All of them.

582
01:37:48,919 --> 01:37:51,295
Six.

583
01:37:54,799 --> 01:37:58,302
I've never counted them before.

584
01:39:44,071 --> 01:39:46,447
No Juan no.

585
01:39:46,572 --> 01:39:50,159
No for Christ's sake.
They're waiting for you out there.

586
01:40:38,747 --> 01:40:41,125
(rapid gunfire)

587
01:41:07,108 --> 01:41:09,193
(gunfire continues)

588
01:41:38,096 --> 01:41:40,182
(lull in gunfire)

589
01:41:42,558 --> 01:41:44,977
(gunfire recommences)

590
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:48,606
(gunfire continues)

591
01:42:32,398 --> 01:42:34,483
(gunfire ceases)

592

594

(shouting in Spanish)

595
01:42:44,451 --> 01:42:48,247
(man) Hold it!
Move that bastard out of the truck.

596
01:42:48,372 --> 01:42:51,374
(man) See that he gets to the camp alive!

597
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:53,710
(truck moves away)

598
01:43:46,427 --> 01:43:48,804
(clap of thunder)

599
01:45:54,925 --> 01:45:57,636

600
01:46:01,222 --> 01:46:03,558
'Uno dos uno'

601
01:46:12,776 --> 01:46:16,780

602
01:46:21,659 --> 01:46:24,870

'Posición de tiro'

606
01:46:42,428 --> 01:46:44,013
¿ Tienen algo qué pedir?

607
01:46:49,936 --> 01:46:52,313
Pelotón

608
01:46:55,733 --> 01:46:58,027
'Preparen'

609
01:46:58,152 --> 01:47:00,363

610
01:47:01,406 --> 01:47:03,449

612
01:49:02,354 --> 01:49:04,898
(gunshots)

613
01:49:09,069 --> 01:49:11,405

614
01:49:21,665 --> 01:49:24,292
(man shouts in Spanish)

615
01:50:49,165 --> 01:50:51,251
¿ Tienes algo qué pedir?

616
01:51:35,126 --> 01:51:37,587
(officer shouts orders in Spanish)

617
01:51:42,674 --> 01:51:45,093
'Posición de tiro'

618
01:51:51,391 --> 01:51:53,727
'Preparen armas'

619
01:51:53,852 --> 01:51:55,770
(gun barrels click)

620
01:51:57,272 --> 01:51:58,607
'Apunten'

621
01:51:58,732 --> 01:52:00,817
(John) Duck you suckers!

622
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:34,515
(rapid gunfire)

623
01:52:43,024 --> 01:52:45,109
(gunfire and shouting)

624
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:32,712

(continues to shouts orders)

631
01:55:09,997 --> 01:55:12,083
(gunshots)

632
01:57:17,495 --> 01:57:20,039
But for the rich you sing.

633
01:57:34,177 --> 01:57:36,513
Oh Jesus Juan.

634
01:57:37,556 --> 01:57:39,641
(John laughs)

635
01:57:41,851 --> 01:57:47,274
Anyway if they ever get this thing under way
you might be able to...

636
01:57:47,399 --> 01:57:52,903
...might be make the border by what
some time tonight don't you think?

637
01:57:57,074 --> 01:58:01,287
America. It's America Juan!

638
01:58:02,288 --> 01:58:06,542
Oh Jesus if it's as great as they say it is

639
01:58:06,667 --> 01:58:09,086
filled bags stuffed full of dreams...

640
01:58:09,211 --> 01:58:11,171
Juan?

641
01:58:15,633 --> 01:58:18,303
Oh Jesus.

642
01:58:21,598 --> 01:58:24,142
Jesus Juan.

643
01:58:26,352 --> 01:58:29,981
What is it Juan and... John?

644
01:58:31,774 --> 01:58:34,611
Johnny and Johnny?

645
01:58:34,736 --> 01:58:39,114
I make the holes and you get in. 50-50 right?

646
01:58:39,239 --> 01:58:41,325
(clattering)

647
01:58:45,621 --> 01:58:47,706

01:59:01,469 --> 01:59:03,554
(agitated chatter)

649
01:59:05,765 --> 01:59:07,975
(siren blasts)

650
02:00:03,529 --> 02:00:05,573
What's happening?

651
02:00:06,282 --> 02:00:09,409
Oh they're just moving the train around.

652
02:00:10,118 --> 02:00:12,537
Seems we'll be leaving shortly.

653
02:00:14,038 --> 02:00:17,250
The uniforms have loaded the last of their shit.

654
02:00:17,876 --> 02:00:19,627
(whistle blows)

655
02:00:32,973 --> 02:00:35,100
(train whistle blows)

656
02:00:42,149 --> 02:00:44,234
(squawks)

657
02:01:12,220 --> 02:01:14,472
(squawking persists)

658
02:01:25,190 --> 02:01:27,275
(chicken clucks softly)

659
02:01:34,616 --> 02:01:36,701
(squawking recommences)

660
02:01:38,787 --> 02:01:41,080
(intense squawk)

661
02:01:41,205 --> 02:01:43,290
(silence)

662
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:53,425
(train whistle blows)

663
02:02:03,685 --> 02:02:05,770
(crashing)

664
02:02:17,323 --> 02:02:19,534
(rapid gunfire)

665
02:03:16,504 --> 02:03:19,257
Get out of the way.

666
02:03:28,099 --> 02:03:31,520
What do you want from me you scum?

667
02:03:31,645 --> 02:03:33,522
Let me by.

668
02:04:03,258 --> 02:04:05,385
(gunfire continues outside)

669
02:04:28,490 --> 02:04:32,327
(noise of gunfire intensifies)

670
02:05:22,667 --> 02:05:24,961
It's yours.

671
02:05:28,506 --> 02:05:31,550
There's a fortune inside.

672
02:05:36,430 --> 02:05:38,390
...pearls.

673
02:07:25,619 --> 02:07:28,204
(man shouts) 'Jóvenes a México'

674
02:07:56,231 --> 02:08:00,276
Well this will not be going to America.

675
02:08:00,401 --> 02:08:03,488
(Juan) Maybe the train won't but we will.

676
02:08:16,750 --> 02:08:18,961
Hey...

677
02:08:20,838 --> 02:08:22,965
Which way is America?

678
02:08:27,636 --> 02:08:32,474
Well it's sure as hell not that way.
That's the way.

679
02:08:36,561 --> 02:08:39,063
Well then...

680
02:08:45,194 --> 02:08:47,280
...let's go.

681
02:08:48,406 --> 02:08:50,491
(both laugh)

682
02:08:57,248 --> 02:08:59,332
(cheering)

683
02:09:05,213 --> 02:09:08,175
Even Pancho Villa's heard much about you.

684
02:09:08,300 --> 02:09:11,970
He's always saying
"I want to meet this Miranda."

685
02:09:16,057 --> 02:09:18,143
Me?

686
02:09:19,394 --> 02:09:21,687
That's right.

687
02:09:21,812 --> 02:09:25,816
The military junta commander
told us everything that you've done.

688
02:09:25,941 --> 02:09:29,570
Whatever you heard I assure you
they were only words.

689
02:09:30,613 --> 02:09:34,950
Words cannot describe
what Juan has done and suffered for the cause.

690
02:09:35,075 --> 02:09:36,952
(Juan laughs)

691
02:09:37,620 --> 02:09:40,080
Hey doctor.

692
02:09:41,749 --> 02:09:44,126
How you been eh?

693
02:09:44,876 --> 02:09:48,296
This is a man who should talk to Villa.

694
02:09:49,672 --> 02:09:52,258
Hey.

695
02:09:54,844 --> 02:09:56,930
John.

696
02:10:06,523 --> 02:10:08,941
We thought we'd lost you doctor.

697
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:14,238
(wheels screech)

698
02:10:22,746 --> 02:10:24,832
(crashing)

699
02:10:26,458 --> 02:10:28,836
Have you got a light?

700
02:10:32,922 --> 02:10:37,969
Listen Gunther Ruiz is after us
and Villa wants to talk to me.

701
02:10:38,094 --> 02:10:40,471
We should get outta here.

702
02:10:41,681 --> 02:10:48,020
Jesus Juan you can't leave now.
You're a glorious hero of the revolution.

703
02:10:48,145 --> 02:10:49,897
Can I tell you something?

704
02:10:50,022 --> 02:10:52,108
Fuck you!

705
02:10:57,362 --> 02:10:59,739
That's all.

706
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:18,757
A military train carrying over 1000 soldiers and
heavy weapons is heading straight towards us.

707
02:11:18,883 --> 02:11:21,510
What about Villa's troops?

708
02:11:21,635 --> 02:11:26,891
He met resistance in the Sierra
and ask s us to hold out for 24 hours.

709
02:11:35,983 --> 02:11:39,028
- Where the hell are we?
- Approximately here.

710
02:11:40,528 --> 02:11:43,448
Ah it's a beautiful desert there.

711
02:11:43,573 --> 02:11:46,409
Not a stream or a canyon in 100 miles.

712
02:11:46,534 --> 02:11:51,581
- How long you think it'll take them to get here?
- Three hours more or less.

713
02:11:51,706 --> 02:11:53,708
Three hours.

714
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:11,892
Well it look s as though
we'll have to stop 'em right here doesn't it?

715
02:12:13,519 --> 02:12:17,064
All that takes
is unbolting a couple of yards of track.

716
02:12:17,189 --> 02:12:20,442
But then what? They'd still slaughter us.

717
02:12:20,567 --> 02:12:21,944
Wait.

718
02:12:22,069 --> 02:12:25,197
There's more than one way to stop a train.

719
02:12:26,739 --> 02:12:30,451
- How much dynamite have we?
- Maybe 200 Ibs.

720
02:12:30,576 --> 02:12:33,037
Is that enough for you?

721
02:12:34,372 --> 02:12:37,416
Oh yes. It'll have to do all right.

722
02:12:38,125 --> 02:12:43,130
- But I also need a locomotive and a man.
- Sí sí sí OK.

723
02:12:45,216 --> 02:12:46,968
OK.

724
02:12:47,093 --> 02:12:53,223
- Someone who's brave and loyal to the cause.
- Never mind that. What do I have to do?

725
02:12:55,225 --> 02:12:57,227
Someone like Dr Villega.

726
02:13:04,067 --> 02:13:06,778
Well...

727
02:13:07,988 --> 02:13:12,658
- I... I'm honoured.
- (John) I don't doubt it doctor.

728
02:13:13,659 --> 02:13:18,164
Also because an old friend of ours
is in command of that train.

729
02:13:18,289 --> 02:13:20,416
A Colonel Gunther Ruiz.

730
02:13:28,924 --> 02:13:31,594
(train whistle blows)

731
02:14:30,274 --> 02:14:34,904
(John) Let's get shovelling man.
We'll never get up enough pressure that way.

732
02:14:49,125 --> 02:14:52,462
Come on put your back in it Villega.

733
02:15:01,179 --> 02:15:05,892
Let's stop pretending right away.
You know everything don't you?

734
02:15:06,017 --> 02:15:10,813
- You sensed it or guessed it.
- Simpler than that Villega.

735
02:15:10,938 --> 02:15:14,775
I saw you that night in the rain.

736
02:15:25,161 --> 02:15:29,498
I see.
You've already judged and condemned me.

737
02:15:39,674 --> 02:15:43,678
That's why you brought me with you. To kill me.

738
02:15:44,762 --> 02:15:48,683
It's easy to judge. Have you ever been tortured?

739
02:15:48,808 --> 02:15:53,688
Are you sure you wouldn't talk?
I was sure. And yet I talked.

740
02:15:54,980 --> 02:15:59,943
Some men died because of me.
What should I do? Kill myself? Why?

741
02:16:00,068 --> 02:16:03,155
The dead remain dead but I have not changed.

742
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:07,993
I still believe in the same things.
I can still serve the cause.

743
02:16:08,118 --> 02:16:11,246
Shut up Villega! Shut up for Christ's sake.

744
02:18:21,913 --> 02:18:28,336
When I started using dynamite
I believed in many things. All of it!

745
02:18:30,129 --> 02:18:32,590
Finally I believe only in dynamite.

746
02:18:33,633 --> 02:18:35,717
I don't judge you Villega.

747
02:18:38,428 --> 02:18:41,723
I did that only once in my life.

748
02:18:43,016 --> 02:18:45,352
Get shovelling!

749
02:20:21,652 --> 02:20:24,530
(John) The end of the line Villega.

750
02:20:27,241 --> 02:20:29,619
And I can't help you now.

751
02:20:44,591 --> 02:20:47,636
Just close your eyes and jump.

752
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:18,873
'Dios mío frena'

753
02:21:18,998 --> 02:21:21,459
(screechging)

754
02:21:22,335 --> 02:21:24,420
(whistle blows)

755
02:23:10,189 --> 02:23:12,273
(gunfire and explosions)

756
02:23:44,471 --> 02:23:46,557
(explosion)

757
02:24:32,184 --> 02:24:34,269
(gunfire continues)

758
02:25:01,754 --> 02:25:03,839
(piercing gunshot)

759
02:25:05,674 --> 02:25:07,467
(second gunshot)

760
02:25:08,218 --> 02:25:10,178
Oh shit...

761
02:25:13,681 --> 02:25:15,725
God...

762
02:25:57,140 --> 02:25:58,724
(groans)

763
02:26:35,427 --> 02:26:37,471
Hey.

764
02:26:37,596 --> 02:26:41,015
Man remember huh?

765
02:26:43,017 --> 02:26:45,769
You remember what you told me huh?

766
02:26:46,437 --> 02:26:49,231
You told me about America.

767
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:54,320
And the bank s and the gold.

768
02:26:54,445 --> 02:26:58,073
Like you told me on the train remember?

769
02:27:02,453 --> 02:27:04,704
Hey hey.

770
02:27:06,122 --> 02:27:08,500
Hey.

771
02:27:08,625 --> 02:27:09,834
(Juan laughs)

772
02:27:09,959 --> 02:27:15,799
No you son of a bitch. Come on
you son of a bitch. You know you told me that.

773
02:27:15,924 --> 02:27:20,345
You leave me now
what the fuck is gonna happen to me?

774
02:27:22,722 --> 02:27:27,726
- You'll make it General.
- Oh shit I don't want to be a general.

775
02:27:33,982 --> 02:27:36,401
Come on talk to me.

776
02:27:36,527 --> 02:27:38,320
Keep talking.

777
02:27:38,445 --> 02:27:42,533
Talk. Tell me about Villega Villega.
Remember Villega?

778
02:27:42,658 --> 02:27:45,035
- Villega?
- Sí

779
02:27:46,036 --> 02:27:48,539
He died.

780
02:27:49,956 --> 02:27:53,334
He died a great...

781
02:27:54,418 --> 02:27:58,297
...grand glorious hero of the revolution.

782
02:28:02,301 --> 02:28:04,387
(John laughs)

783
02:28:17,732 --> 02:28:19,693
OK.

784
02:28:20,527 --> 02:28:25,615
Easy easy. I'll go I'll get help huh?

785
02:28:31,997 --> 02:28:33,790
General?

786
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:42,006
- Have you a light?
- Sí

787
02:29:21,002 --> 02:29:23,462
Oh my friend...

788
02:29:24,755 --> 02:29:28,008
...I'd hate to give you a royal screwing.

789
02:29:55,785 --> 02:29:57,870
I go get help.

790
02:30:03,876 --> 02:30:05,962
(gunfire continues)

791
02:33:57,266 --> 02:33:59,935
Johnny!

792
02:34:47,605 --> 02:34:50,024
(thinks) What about me?
