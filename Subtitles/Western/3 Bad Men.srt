Gold on Indian land! The Sioux tribes
were given other reservation,

6
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,684
and President Grant set a day

7
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,492
when settlers might race for
possession of the rich lands.

13
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:24,345
In the middle of the seventies,

14
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:29,078
ship of hope bore thousands of emigrants

15
00:01:29,152 --> 00:01:34,488
to seek the reality of their dreams in America.

16
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:47,467
Some sought happiness ...
some only the horn of plently ...

17
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,306
the chalice of ... the Unholy Grail ...

18
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,743
And from crowded eastern cities,

19
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,809
civilization began pouring the overflow into

20
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,856
the trackless immensity of the West.

21
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,085
Spring, 1876 ...

22
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:14,259
Old World blood began to fuse with Colonial strains ...

23
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:18,100
and "westward the course
of empire takes its way".

24
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,631
In the Black Hills of Dakota,

25
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:52,569
the outriders of progress had
set up a trading post at Custer.

26
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:05,307
" Gold! Gold ... I'm tellin' ye ...
the mountains is just abustin' with it! "

27
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,525
" Sorry, Lucas, but we can't touch that land ...

28
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,995
it's on the Sioux Reservation. "

29
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,656
" Where'd you strike it, Lucas? "

30
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:06,004
And then came the eager thud of hoofs
and the creak of wagon wheels.

31
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,589
The start of an empire
that was to be compounded

32
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,456

" I'd like to hire you three,
but I suppose you have
business to attend to ..."

111
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:28,750
" To tell the truth, miss ...  our
business ain't what it used to be."

112
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:40,595
" Then you're free ... for the moment? "

" So are we ! "

125
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:41,204
" It's plumb low-down to do a thing

127
00:31:22,844 --> 00:31:26,780
" What our gal needs is a husband! "

128

" Leave it to us! We'll find a marryin' man ...
if we have to shoot him."

Husband hunting ...

135
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:34,498

" Come on ... you ain't safe alone."

141
00:35:28,423 --> 00:35:34,885
" If a man's heart is in the right place,
it don't matter what sex he belongs to."

142
00:36:23,511 --> 00:36:29,746
Dan sold his outfit and joined the stampede.

143
00:37:47,228 --> 00:37:53,531
" You're mine now .... Hunter wanted

00:39:28,463 --> 00:39:30,431
" I found a man ! "

148
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:19,611
" It's plumb unsafe for you to go
ridin' alone that a-way."

149
00:40:37,532 --> 00:40:39,830
" He's the new hired hand."

150
00:40:42,036 --> 00:40:46,666
" But 'bull' ... I don't think
we need any more help."

151
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:02,543
" Not so bad ..."

152
00:42:11,626 --> 00:42:12,820
" Not so good ..."

153
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:19,391
" All right ... he'll do."

154
00:42:50,097 --> 00:42:53,328
" Now let nature take its course."

155
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:20,557
" I hope he don't drink ..."

156
00:43:23,898 --> 00:43:26,958
"... we don't want no soaks around here."

157
00:43:45,486 --> 00:43:50,014
" I haven't seen your dad around
... Where is he? "

158
00:45:12,973 --> 00:45:15,942
" Sheriff some of the better element ...

159

" Listen, Rabbi ... Business is terrible! ...

161
00:45:38,399 --> 00:45:41,994
Nobody buys a new suit even to be buried in. "

162
00:45:47,274 --> 00:45:50,402
Cleanliness is next to Goldliness ...

163
00:45:50,477 --> 00:45:54,811
That's why Saturday night
comes before Sunday.

164
00:46:42,629 --> 00:46:48,363
" You don't reckon she'll be wantin'
us to take a bath, do you? "

165
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:56,037
" I'm a little nervous about it."

166
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,281
" Guard the tent."

167
00:47:45,192 --> 00:47:49,754
" How about three fingers of bug juice?"

168
00:48:38,345 --> 00:48:41,678
♫ " I'm here in Dakota I want the world to know ...♫

169
00:48:41,748 --> 00:48:45,616
♫ Goin' to get a homstead.
Cause I found my calico! " ♫

170
00:49:27,594 --> 00:49:30,825
" Do you like that tune, Miss Lee? "

171
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,389
" Having a nice time ? "

172
00:51:21,942 --> 00:51:26,470
" You're goin' to tell me
how to get that gold ! "

173
00:51:58,311 --> 00:52:04,045
" Hunter, you've been takin' in too much
territory... Now you're all through! "

174
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:36,272
" You bungling fool !"

175
00:52:51,598 --> 00:52:58,436
" Hunter sent him to be make me
tell the way to the gold land ..."

176
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:08,877
" ... my map won't do me any good now ...
but it'll take you to where there's gold ! "

177
00:53:23,797 --> 00:53:27,164
The night before the rush ....
Custer, an armed camp ...

178
00:53:27,234 --> 00:53:30,965
with "Bull" Stanley leading
the revolt against Hunter.

179
00:53:41,047 --> 00:53:43,811
... while in the little church the women pray ...

180
00:53:43,884 --> 00:53:46,648
for safety, today ...
Divine guidance tomorrow...

181
00:53:48,088 --> 00:53:54,618
"... and as He led the children of Israel into
the promised land, so He will lead us ..."

182
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:13,808
Knowing his danger, Hunter fans the flames
of lawless abandon among his followers.

183
00:54:38,305 --> 00:54:41,706
" Burn that psalm-singing preacher's shack! "

184
00:58:18,591 --> 00:58:19,853
" Brother! Brother! "

185
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,862
" Brother! Brother! "

186
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:40,941
" Brother! "

187
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:18,481
" It's gettin' stuffy in here with all
this smoke and love ... I'm leavin' !"

188
00:59:25,325 --> 00:59:29,091
" We'll sneak across the line tonight and wait. "

189
01:00:26,452 --> 01:00:27,817
" Millie! Little Sister! "

190
01:00:39,632 --> 01:00:42,863
" Millie, who is ... the man? "

191
01:04:06,439 --> 01:04:08,430
The Grand Land Rush!

192
01:04:08,508 --> 01:04:11,807
Morning broke with the clatter of wagons ...

193
01:04:11,878 --> 01:04:15,575
the roaring, sweating, cursing,
fighting mob scrambling ...

194
01:04:15,648 --> 01:04:18,583
for position in the line.

195
01:04:36,236 --> 01:04:41,572
" It's time for you to start, Missy ...
you've got a long, hard ride ahead ..."

196
01:04:44,143 --> 01:04:47,442
" I'm ready when you are, 'Bull'! "

197
01:04:51,251 --> 01:04:58,123
" Mike and 'Spade' will take care of you ...
I've got to look for someone else."

198
01:05:03,863 --> 01:05:05,831
" Please, 'Bull'... I need you. "

199
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:44,036
On the line! Ready for the dot of twelve ...
And the race for land and gold.

Carleton's thoroughbreds ... sensing
the drama of the historic trial of speed.

211
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:56,909
" Keep your plow! You'll find the real
wealth of this land in the soil ! "

212

" Remember ... The Pathfinder correspondent

Miles across the line
... watching ... waiting ...

216
01:08:26,599 --> 01:08:31,627
" We'll wait to see where the Carleton
outfit goes ... then follow."

" What time is it? "

218
01:09:18,784 --> 01:09:21,446
" One minute to twelwe, Sir."

" The Carleton crowd leading!
The Kennedys a closed second! "

220
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,759
" A little Moses ...
lost among the land rushers! "

221
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:06,010
The end of a day of furious riding ...
the Carleton far ahead.

222
01:13:33,272 --> 01:13:36,264
BUSTED BY GOD

223
01:13:57,096 --> 01:14:04,025
" The parson was right, Ned;
we'll stay right here.
This soil is as rich as gold."

224
01:14:11,477 --> 01:14:13,536
Hunter sights his prey ...

225
01:14:16,215 --> 01:14:23,383
... and the Carleton seek escape through
a narrow pass to the gold country.

226

" You and Miss Lee go on ahead
... we'll follow along. "

01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:09,450
" Shucks! One good man could
hold this pass against a whole
army of men like Hunter. "

230
01:16:18,103 --> 01:16:20,037
" I said a good man."

231
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:28,472
" Mike, your pants may be shabby,
but they cover a warm heart ..."
