1
00:00:00,264 --> 00:00:01,823
<i>Previously on</i> Californication...

2
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:04,446
I was talking to Dani
about our sexual problem.

3
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:05,864
She's totally in.

4
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:10,943
- I've got to get my camera. This is...
- Motherfucker!

5
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:15,319
Most recently, I gave man birth
to a tome called "God hates us all."

6
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:19,545
Which was turned into a movie called
"A crazy little thing called love."

7
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:23,298
You drink too much, write too little,
and only take exercise in the bedroom.

8
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:27,000
Some folks have compared
the wait for your new novel

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,389
to the decade-plus wait
for the new <i>Guns n' Roses</i> album.

10
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:34,017
- How's the new book coming?
- Now, that's a hostile question.

11
00:00:34,277 --> 00:00:35,602
I got you a ticket.

12
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:38,188
I hope that's fully refundable
because I ain't going.

13
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:40,419
You're not going to your dad's funeral?

14
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,288
He was a fucking asshole.

15
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:43,933
You're not your father.

16
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:54,025
Subtitles: swsub.com

17
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:59,388
<i>The white zone is for the immediate
loading and unloading of passengers.</i>

18
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:00,479
Holy shit!

19
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:05,292
I was just about
to call the super shuttle.

20
00:01:05,964 --> 00:01:08,308
How are you? How was it?

21
00:01:10,982 --> 00:01:12,612
Too much, right? With the pelvis?

22
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:16,518
I thought maybe I could get a little
half a grind there, but maybe not.

23
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:18,855
I'm not here to pick you up,
but Bill.

24
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:21,537
You don't think I saw
Bilbo Baggins in 1st class?

25
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:23,592
He doesn't travel very light...

26
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:27,468
Give the guy a break.
He's been away for a month.

27
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:32,121
- A lot can happen in a month. A lot <i>did.</i>
- You shut up. Don't say a word.

28
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,481
Don't hold back on my account, guys.

29
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:44,486
- I'm not.
- Really?

30
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:49,377
'cause if it was me, I would grab that
ass. I would grab it like I owned it.

31
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,562
Especially after
such a prolonged absence.

32
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,074
Would now be the appropriate time, Hank,
to say how sorry I am for your loss?

33
00:01:56,561 --> 00:02:00,830
It would have been more appropriate
3 h ago with a free drink and a sundae.

34
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,965
What were you doing
with those hot towels?

35
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:06,527
- You got a bad case of swamp ass?
- It must have been a very long flight.

36
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:08,987
I think this is where
we should part company.

37
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:12,029
- I see a cab with my name on it.
- Don't be ridiculous.

38
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:15,948
- Bill, it's just a figure of speech.
- We'll give you a ride home.

39
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:18,517
Really? That's mighty white of you.

40
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:21,667
No, he loves cabs.
It reminds him of the big apple.

41
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:25,119
There's no need to punish
the environment unnecessarily.

42
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:29,109
- That, you will put out, of course.
- This, yeah. Of course, yeah.

43
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,150
And... here.

44
00:02:33,732 --> 00:02:35,041
I got shotgun.

45
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:22,345
No way, man.

46
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:26,023
What the fuck is so great
about that $30 salad, anyway?

47
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:31,053
Yeah, shit. Okay, yeah. Fine, whatever.

48
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:32,921
That's fine. 8:00.

49
00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:35,536
You weren't cooking tonight?

50
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:38,452
I've got to go to Koi
for the 400th fucking time.

51
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:43,009
Sometimes, I'm surprised
I don't shit crispy rice with spicy tuna.

52
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,696
I bring you something home?
Maybe some baked crab roll?

53
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:51,256
We could eat it in bed while we watch
all those <i>CSI Miamis</i> I saved up.

54
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:54,755
A little late-night snack
with your snack daddy?

55
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:56,192
I'm good.

56
00:03:56,426 --> 00:03:59,585
I actually think
I might have a thing tonight.

57
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:03,099
A thing?

58
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:05,646
I'm thinking about going to book club.

59
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,794
Well, you'll be home early, then.

60
00:04:09,338 --> 00:04:11,038
Earlyish, I guess.

61
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:14,947
Why so curious all of a sudden?
You said you were going out tonight.

62
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:17,286
I'm not. I'm not curious
all of a sudden.

63
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:19,864
I happen to know
you fucking hate book club.

64
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,038
When you commit to something,
you're supposed to stick with it.

65
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,806
Sure.

66
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,475
I guess I'll leave you to it, then.
See you later.

67
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:35,336
Later.

68
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:35,103
- Dad!
- That's my name. Don't wear it out.

69
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:40,343
You guys. My God.
That was incredible.

70
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:42,565
I want you to play that song
at the wedding.

71
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:45,983
- Let's not get carried away.
- What? What do you mean?

72
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:47,623
You're very, very good.

73
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:52,461
I think if you give them some time,
they could bone up on some Supertramp.

74
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:55,213
I don't get it.
You don't want them to play that song?

75
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,260
No, I don't mean anything. I thought
we decided on the string quartet.

76
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,470
Bill, what?

77
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:02,981
Dan Fogelberg.

78
00:06:03,326 --> 00:06:05,287
And I think, perhaps...

79
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:07,143
- Hey, Bec.
- Yes, posh.

80
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:09,311
Our guests could use a beverage.

81
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:10,395
Agreed.

82
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:14,149
I don't want to get your hopes up, guys.

83
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:16,419
But you keep rolling
with the marital discord,

84
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:19,186
and I see you across from Oprah
on a big yellow couch.

85
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:20,576
Fingers crossed.

86
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:28,038
Okay, great.
Thank you. Are you coming up?

87
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:29,655
No. Why?

88
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:33,460
- For make up the sex.
- Are you fucking insane, Hank?

89
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,016
Do the seats on this recline?

90
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:39,773
Whatever sex we're gonna have,
we've had, okay?

91
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,177
It's little late to play hard to get.

92
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:44,921
We need to start acting
like we split up already.

93
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,541
Let's just forget about it.

94
00:06:46,768 --> 00:06:49,219
Who could forget
such a knee-rattling orgasm?

95
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:52,312
You were grieving.
I was co-grieving. It was a slip.

96
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:55,190
I think you knocked something
loose down there, tiger.

97
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,558
I wrote something.

98
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:01,176
That's great, Hank.

99
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:04,367
I don't think you heard me.
I wrote something.

100
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:07,786
Not that blog shit. That's why
I was in New York for so long.

101
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:10,267
I just sat down
at my mother's Old Smith Corona.

102
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:14,793
I didn't get up for two weeks.
I got pages here, honey. Many pages.

103
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:18,672
- It's rough, but it's something.
- Great. I wish you a lot of luck.

104
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:21,925
You fucked it out of me, and now
you don't want to take responsibility?

105
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:25,353
You know, fuck you.
I'm not that person anymore, okay.

106
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:28,932
I'm not your fucking
sounding-board-Cum-security blanket.

107
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:31,251
You're not in the least bit interested?

108
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,354
- Yes, of course.
- Fine, then it's settled. There it is.

109
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:36,806
I'm not taking no for an answer.

110
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,651
I'm sure it's very good.
I'm sure it's excellent.

111
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:43,296
Most likely, it's a piece of crap.
I won't know until you tell me.

112
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:46,585
'cause that's the way it goes.
I give it to you, and you tell me.

113
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:49,456
I don't see the difference between
the ridiculous and the sublime

114
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:52,075
until <i>you</i> tell <i>me.</i>
Now, be careful with that.

115
00:07:52,424 --> 00:07:54,040
You've got my life there in your hands.

116
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,460
This is just words, you know.
It's words, okay. Take it.

117
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,255
Well, words is all I have left
to play with.

118
00:08:00,526 --> 00:08:02,106
So be gentle.

119
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:05,329
Please tell Becca
to expect a gentleman caller.

120
00:08:05,603 --> 00:08:07,220
Hank, please, take this.

121
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:10,261
Honestly, thank you. Smell you later.

122
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:12,519
Fuck.

123
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,937
Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it!

124
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:47,260
- Okay, you're a good agent.
- That's right, motherfucker!

125
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,985
If it hadn't been for me putting
that little clause in your contract,

126
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,516
then you wouldn't be holding
that big, fat wad of cash.

127
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:56,074
Yeah, fucking blood money is what it is.

128
00:08:56,214 --> 00:08:58,021
Who the fuck cares what it is?

129
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:00,245
Thanks to
the aggressively mediocre taste

130
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:03,526
of the American movie going public,
you now get to reap the benefits.

131
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,081
Bonus time, baby. Treat yourself.

132
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:07,893
Treat myself?

133
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:10,825
- Get yourself a new car.
- I don't want a new car.

134
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:12,827
I like my old one. It's got character.

135
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:17,086
If by that, you mean lady juice in every
nook and cranny of the upholstery,

136
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:18,917
then, yes, you're totally right.

137
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:21,586
- That explains a lot, actually.
- Get it washed then.

138
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:23,885
Now you could probably
even get yourself

139
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:26,299
one of those little
prepaid coupon booklets.

140
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,005
You put it in the glove compartment.
That's how I roll.

141
00:09:29,262 --> 00:09:31,753
- That's how you roll?
- That's how I roll, baby.

142
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:34,321
I did purchase
what is commonly referred to

143
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:37,214
by the kids as a big-ticket item.

144
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,411
What'd be that?

145
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:45,661
OK. I'm getting a bad feeling here.

146
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:48,655
- Why is that?
- I'm thinking you intend to give that

147
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:51,241
to someone who might already be engaged.

148
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:54,524
- That's the plan, motherfucker.
- Don't do this to yourself, Hank.

149
00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:57,247
Come on, Charlie.
Don't do what to myself?

150
00:09:57,507 --> 00:09:59,541
Give up what I want?
I've done the research.

151
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:02,034
Karen and I belong together.
And I feel good.

152
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:05,619
Lately... just the past little while,
things are looking up for me.

153
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,590
I feel a change. I wrote something.

154
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:08,932
Wait.

155
00:10:09,497 --> 00:10:10,504
You what?

156
00:10:13,098 --> 00:10:14,949
You wrote something? Okay.

157
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,807
I've dreamed
about this moment, alright,

158
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:21,350
the one where you come to me,
pages in hand.

159
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:24,316
You say, "please read this."
I do, and it's fucking genius.

160
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:29,033
I sell it, we both get back on track,
and we live happily ever fucking after.

161
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,309
Fuck me. No pressure there.

162
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:33,908
What is it? A screenplay?
A short story? What?

163
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,369
No more screenplays for me.
It's a novel.

164
00:10:37,526 --> 00:10:41,328
It's a short novel. It's a modern-day
answer to "Lolita," really.

165
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,096
You know, an older man
unwittingly beds an underage girl.

166
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:48,186
It unravels his life completely.
High jinks ensue.

167
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:50,963
Broner. You gave me a broner.

168
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,209
Where is it? Let me read it!

169
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,180
Dani, cancel my lunch!

170
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,891
I gave it to Karen.
She reads all my stuff first.

171
00:10:58,151 --> 00:11:01,914
So? Slip me a copy. I promise
I won't read it till after she's done.

172
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:04,753
That's the only one.
I went old-school this time.

173
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:06,816
I hunted and pecked
like a motherfucker.

174
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:09,020
Whatever.
This is great fucking news!

175
00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:12,981
I'm not so sure, Charlie.
I mean, you know, most likely, it sucks.

176
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,352
Well, that's where I come in.
I'll sell the shit out of it.

177
00:11:16,662 --> 00:11:19,338
By the time I get through spinning,
nobody will be able to tell

178
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:22,665
if it's a piece of shit or the work
of staggering genius.

179
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:24,542
There's a difference?

180
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:55,163
Hi.

181
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:57,635
Leave me alone.

182
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:00,421
- A hostile...
- No, I'm browsing.

183
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:04,247
If I have any questions, I'll ask you.
Now, shoo, you little parasite, you.

184
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:08,251
- She's still coming...
- What do you do?

185
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,683
- I'm a writer.
- Oh, yeah? Movies? TV?

186
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,467
Books. Novels. The occasional <i>haiku</i>.

187
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,334
Alright, well, let me know
if you have any questions.

188
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,972
What the fuck was that?

189
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:24,024
- What?
- You think I can't afford

190
00:12:24,231 --> 00:12:26,811
this penile implant on wheels,
so you're done with me.

191
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:29,157
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

192
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:30,607
Guy's got feelings.

193
00:12:33,438 --> 00:12:35,487
This one. I want to drive this one.

194
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,797
- Let me get the keys.
- Please.

195
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,580
- I love L.A.
- So, what do you think?

196
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:48,506
- It's really clean.
- That's it?

197
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:51,993
This is one of the finest automobiles
the world has to offer.

198
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,421
I'm not a big car guy.

199
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:56,951
I think if I got to open it up
past, like, 7 mph,

200
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:59,117
I might really fall in love with it.

201
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:02,426
Will you get off that fucking phone
before I stuff it up your ass?

202
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:05,840
- Hey, buddy!
- What, are you kidding me?

203
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,436
I kid you not, sir. Shame on you.

204
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:10,765
Mind your own fucking business.

205
00:13:10,993 --> 00:13:12,914
You don't wanna be that guy.
Look at her!

206
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:16,277
She's perfect. She's drop-dead.
She's firecrackers on the 4th!

207
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:18,905
You'll never do better, but she can.
You see?

208
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,868
So, tell me something.

209
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:29,396
What do I have to do
to get you into this car?

210
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:33,303
Well, let's talk about the extras.

211
00:13:49,174 --> 00:13:52,397
I like the BMW, too, though.
No, I like it. It's roomy.

212
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:55,181
It's leather! Leather!

213
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:05,583
Hey, honey, your dad's here!

214
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:11,340
- What the fuck is that?
- Just ignore that.

215
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,499
It's hard. It's very shiny.

216
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,259
- What about that?
- What?

217
00:14:15,446 --> 00:14:18,715
Any thoughts? Notes?
Did the kool-aid still taste as sweet?

218
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:22,524
Shall I turn around so you can
blow smoke up my ass more easily?

219
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:26,268
- You wanna fuck me 'cause I'm a genius?
- I didn't have time, sorry.

220
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,360
- I really am.
- No, don't be sorry. I mean...

221
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:33,229
I just thought you'd be more intrigued.

222
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,306
No, I am intrigued.

223
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:37,649
- I'm also kind of...
- Horny?

224
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:44,233
No, what? Like you? Like 23 hours a day?
Like some rutting moose, no.

225
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,660
The Billdo is back in black,
and you're not warm for his form.

226
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,788
That shit tells me something.

227
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:53,131
I'll just grab the Becca.
You have things to read.

228
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,544
It's even more phallic
than the last one.

229
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:58,337
- You like?
- I liked the old one better.

230
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:02,081
It had character...
And a funky smell.

231
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,295
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

232
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:08,618
I suggest you brew
one of your special teas,

233
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,709
settle into a backbreaking piece
of modern furniture,

234
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:14,097
and curl up with your favorite author.

235
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:17,106
A Martin Amis, or a Virginia Woolf
or a Charles Bukowksi?

236
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:18,715
Imposters, all.

237
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:31,771
Whatever I want?

238
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:34,100
Whatever you want.

239
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:36,668
The possibilities are endless.

240
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:39,637
Go with something classic and timeless,

241
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,656
something that looks like Keith Richards
might have throw up on it at some point,

242
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:48,671
something that would make Jon Bon Jovi
quake in his acid-washed jeans.

243
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:50,984
Like that one?

244
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:52,886
This blue one? Yeah.

245
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:57,626
- Hey, man. Is Dave around, man?
- No, he's on vacation.

246
00:15:59,617 --> 00:16:02,619
- You need some help?
- No, he's an old friend of mine.

247
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:05,488
I just figured he could help me
with some cash.

248
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:07,740
Bummer.

249
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:12,787
Come on, pretty girl.

250
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:16,097
Father?

251
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:17,872
Offspring?

252
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:20,648
That was a nice guitar.

253
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:24,604
Yes. Sometimes, it's best not to get
involved in the affairs of others.

254
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:26,522
That's interesting,

255
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,053
coming from
the most intrusive man I know.

256
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:34,012
Hey, excuse me!

257
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:38,103
That's a beautiful fiddle
you've got there.

258
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,482
- Yeah?
- Yeah, how much you want for it?

259
00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:42,974
- It's worth a lot, man.
- Yeah, I'll bet.

260
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:45,612
I can put it on EBay
and get over 10 grand, easy.

261
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,034
Yeah, how much you want for it?

262
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,866
- I'd take a grand.
- You said it's worth 10 at least, no?

263
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:55,204
Yeah, well... you gotta do
what you gotta do, man.

264
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,831
Yeah, I hear that.

265
00:17:00,878 --> 00:17:02,128
How about 13.5?

266
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,974
- Come on, man. Don't fuck with me.
- I'm a couple hundred short.

267
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,101
If you give me your address,
I can send you a check.

268
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:17,621
Don't worry about it.
Just play it in good health.

269
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,089
Thank you.

270
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:23,453
My lady, your ax awaits.

271
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:26,284
- You're a good daughter.
- My hair.

272
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:27,883
Sorry. Come on.

273
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:38,081
I have a confession to make.

274
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,583
- Yes?
- You know what you said earlier

275
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:44,796
about not wanting Becca
to play at the wedding?

276
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,115
Bill, that really bothered me.

277
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:50,615
Sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.

278
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:53,513
I just don't want our wedding
to be some big joke.

279
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:56,983
I don't want it to be
some kind of adults-only affair,

280
00:17:57,171 --> 00:18:00,355
you know, all stuffy.
I want it to be fun and whimsical

281
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:03,275
and something
we're gonna remember forever.

282
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:07,914
Alright, I hear you.
Maybe Becca can learn some...

283
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:11,961
Van Morrison.
There's nothing that makes this man cry

284
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,075
like a little "Brown eyed girl."

285
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:16,285
That's definitely a compromise.

286
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:21,124
There's something else
I want to tell...

287
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:23,648
One second! One second...

288
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:28,960
- Hi, Bill.
- "Dad" or "daddy," please.

289
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,065
- Hey.
- Hey.

290
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:34,547
- What's this?
- It's Hank's new book.

291
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,991
Hank wrote a new book?
Well, fuck me running!

292
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,790
Sorry. Can I read it?

293
00:18:42,406 --> 00:18:44,600
I don't think that's appropriate.

294
00:18:44,903 --> 00:18:45,969
Well, is it good?

295
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,319
- I haven't read it yet.
- Why not?

296
00:18:51,122 --> 00:18:52,280
What is this?

297
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:02,415
- Oh, my god. How did you even
- Well, I remembered you saying

298
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,147
how much you liked
the view from your dorm room so...

299
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:08,395
I convinced these
lovely little N.Y.U co-eds

300
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:10,529
to let me take
a picture from their dorm room,

301
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:13,134
which, once upon a time,
was your dorm room.

302
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:15,609
You're just adorable.

303
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:17,138
Well, I try.

304
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:22,631
Now, what was it you wanted to tell me?

305
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:25,501
Oh, nothing.

306
00:19:26,056 --> 00:19:28,119
No, nothing.
Come here. Come here.

307
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:38,539
Get that sweet, little hairless
ass of yours downstairs!

308
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:43,158
- We've got some celebrating to do!
- Hey, I thought you had a dinner.

309
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:45,514
I did. I bailed at the last second.

310
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:48,022
I wanted to see <i>you.</i>

311
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:49,544
Why?

312
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:52,340
I need an excuse to see my wife
all of a sudden?

313
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:55,592
No, it's just --
What is there to celebrate?

314
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:57,749
Hank wrote something.

315
00:19:59,142 --> 00:20:01,479
Well, kudos to Hank. He's a writer.

316
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:03,168
This is a big deal, sweetie.

317
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:05,693
This is like the return of old Hank.

318
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:08,189
Or I don't know.
Maybe it's the new Hank.

319
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:11,975
But the guy,
he came into my office today

320
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,805
with a giant engagement ring
he bought for Karen.

321
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,949
What? What are you talking about?

322
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:20,518
The only thing I could think
when I saw it was, "hope".

323
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:21,762
Baby, hope.

324
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:26,501
Things have been just really fucked-up
around here. You know it, too, right?

325
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:28,709
Ever since, well, the nipple incident.

326
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,184
Or, actually, before then.

327
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,670
But the thing I realize now is

328
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:36,777
that I was
just really depressed, you know.

329
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:39,167
If Hank can get his shit together,
so can I.

330
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:42,516
- and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
- Good for you, Charlie.

331
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:46,237
And I want you to know, baby,
that I'm sorry.

332
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:48,985
For what?

333
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,911
For letting us get
to a place in our lives

334
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,486
where we thought we needed a threesome
to get ourselves back on track.

335
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:57,570
You don't have to apologize for that.

336
00:20:57,712 --> 00:20:59,857
Yes, I do, because it is just not right.

337
00:21:00,057 --> 00:21:01,626
I want you to know...

338
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,803
That you are all I need, baby.

339
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:06,620
You're right, Charlie.

340
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,271
Things have changed since nipple-gate.

341
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:12,587
Yes, and I want to go right back
where we were before.

342
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:16,315
Yeah, I don't think that's possible.

343
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,713
Good. Me, too.

344
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:20,678
Or -- wait. What?
You -- what? You don't?

345
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,200
The thing with your teat

346
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:26,246
made things very clear to me.

347
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:28,769
The morning after
our ill-fated threesome,

348
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:30,036
I woke up,

349
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:33,191
and the only thing
I wanted to do was call Dani.

350
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:36,235
Now, I don't know if that
makes me a fucking rug-muncher.

351
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:40,040
But that sweet, little Goth nutjob

352
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,263
makes this girl want to
put her finger in the dike.

353
00:21:44,747 --> 00:21:45,936
What are you saying?

354
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:52,084
What the fuck?

355
00:21:52,816 --> 00:21:55,030
Oh, we were watching <i>Bound</i> just now.

356
00:21:55,242 --> 00:21:57,131
You're right. That shit is hot.

357
00:21:57,391 --> 00:21:59,300
You do have quite a movie collection.

358
00:21:59,564 --> 00:22:00,671
And quite a wife.

359
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:05,560
You're fired, missy.

360
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:07,114
Too late, boss.

361
00:22:07,332 --> 00:22:09,612
I think it's time I moved on
to a new desk.

362
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,148
- Maybe I'll even be an agent someday.
- I know about everything.

363
00:22:14,408 --> 00:22:17,443
I know about the "s" and "m"
and the light "b" and "d".

364
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,238
And I'm not mad. I'm just kind of sad.

365
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:23,599
And sexually awakened.
I think we should go out there

366
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:25,826
and fuck all the people we never fucked.

367
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,883
Let's just rock out with our cocks out!

368
00:22:29,242 --> 00:22:32,162
Carpe motherfucking diem, baby!

369
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:37,274
What if I don't want to...

370
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,000
rock out with my cock out?

371
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:52,121
What is that?

372
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:54,939
What about the guitar Bill got you?

373
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:56,744
This one's special.

374
00:22:57,524 --> 00:22:59,313
Timeless. Classic.

375
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:03,267
It looks like Keith Richards
threw up on it back in the '70s.

376
00:23:03,454 --> 00:23:04,835
"Back in the '70s."

377
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,367
Thanks, dad.

378
00:23:06,627 --> 00:23:08,493
You're welcome. Now go practice.

379
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:11,460
Extra loud so you
annoy the neighbors and Bill.

380
00:23:11,652 --> 00:23:13,457
I've got to talk to your mom.

381
00:23:20,627 --> 00:23:22,510
A chill just ran up my sack.

382
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:25,691
Hold on a second.
I've got to prepare myself.

383
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:27,447
Yeah, me too.

384
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,695
Okay, just like old times.

385
00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:35,404
Give it to me straight. I want it all.

386
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,664
Here we go.

387
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:39,835
Lay it on me.

388
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:41,228
Brutal truth.

389
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:43,921
I can't.

390
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:45,933
You love ripping me to shreds.

391
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,947
It's not as much fun
when I give you permission?

392
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:51,657
Look at me.

393
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:57,339
You didn't read it.

394
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,129
You didn't fucking read it.

395
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,214
I can't read it, Hank.

396
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,119
Why not?

397
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,619
Because... I can't go back.

398
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,118
That part of my life is over now.

399
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:21,684
There are a number of things going
through my mind to say to you right now,

400
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,955
but only one is coming to the forefront.

401
00:24:24,106 --> 00:24:25,322
And that is...

402
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,742
- Fuck, we had the sex, Karen.
- Shut the fuck up!

403
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,306
Shutting me up is not
gonna make it any less true.

404
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,192
You know what?
That was a onetime thing, okay?

405
00:24:35,468 --> 00:24:37,764
It's done. I mean, I don't regret it.

406
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:40,669
Why would you?
You came, like, three times?

407
00:24:41,494 --> 00:24:43,275
Hank, now I regret it, okay?

408
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:45,066
Now I do regret it.

409
00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:56,527
Hank, the fact that you wrote this
is fucking incredible

410
00:24:56,678 --> 00:24:58,216
I'm so proud of you.

411
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:02,607
And I'm so glad that you have finally
opened a new chapter in your life.

412
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,675
And it's here, and it's great.
You have to do it on your own, okay?

413
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,428
What if I don't want to?

414
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:20,679
What if I want to go back
and do it all over again?

415
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:23,614
Only this time...

416
00:25:25,138 --> 00:25:27,280
Not make the same mistakes.
This time...

417
00:25:27,483 --> 00:25:28,384
do it better.

418
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:32,545
This time, do it right.

419
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:34,985
With...

420
00:25:35,624 --> 00:25:36,469
jewelry.

421
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:41,396
I don't love you anymore.

422
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,967
I love Bill.

423
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:46,560
I'm gonna marry Bill.

424
00:25:46,897 --> 00:25:49,020
And I really need you
to respect that.

425
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:55,879
I'm a fucking asshole.

426
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,750
I'm a motherfucking asshole.

427
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:26,942
Do you know how
to get to the 45 from here?

428
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:28,247
On foot?

429
00:26:30,947 --> 00:26:32,737
You could walk over to Lincoln.

430
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:36,682
Get the fuck out of the car,
motherfucker! Get out of the car!

431
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:41,482
- Get out of the car!
- Get the fuck out now!

432
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:44,863
Come on! Get in, let's go!

433
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:46,906
Shut the fuck up!
