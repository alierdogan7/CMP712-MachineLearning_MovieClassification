00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,074
Bang!

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,212
Bang!

4
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,722
Hi.

5
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:24,728
Hello.

6
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,422
Anybody around?

7
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,308
Good afternoon.

8
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,305
l l've got to get
some papers signe understand d here.

9
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:28,325
Look...

10
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,728
You speak English, because l...

11
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,625
-That's right.
-l speak English.

12
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:35,925
Good.

13
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,664
l want to go inland and
l got the papers.

14
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,341
l want to go inland and
l got papers here.

15
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:51,907
ldentification of permission,
see, to go inland.

16
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,279
You have to sign it or something.

17
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:05,231
l'm looking for a man who might
have come through this way...

18
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,900
a few months ago. A man by
the name of Kallen...

19
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,835
Bob Kallen, Robert Kallen.

20
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,767
l'm sorry.

21
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,034
l want to ride south...

22
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:30,755
to arrest a man by the
name of Kallen.

23
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,423
That's right. Has he been
through here?

24
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,126
Wait a minute.

25
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,330
You and me, we're police.

26
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,837
Police.

27
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,851
Yeah, sure.

28
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,942
Thank you very much.

29
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,542
l guess that takes care
of it. So long.

30
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,450
You go mucha distancia?

31
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,284
l'm going down to a little
place called Cerralvo.

32
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,291
l understand he's hiding out
around there somewhere.

33
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,792
-So long.
-Adiós.

34
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,097
Cerralvo.

35
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:10,780
You know where Cerralvo is?
Up that way?

36
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,261
Thanks very much.

37
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,437
Good morning.

38
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,029
ls this Cerralvo?

39
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,037
Good.

40
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,610
You speak English?

41
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,149
l'm looking for a man, Americano,
a gringo by the...

42
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,848
name of Kallen.

43
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,625
l just wondered if maybe...

44
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,119
Wait a minute!

45
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,036
Can l help you?

46
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,802
-Excuse me. L...
-Just a moment, señor.

47
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,234
My name's Hamish.

48
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,847
How do you do, señor?
l'm Father lgnatius.

49
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,980
How do you do, Father?

50
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,722
l guess the man l was talking to
didn't understand me.

51
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,654
That was Luis.

52
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,892
He does not speak English.

53
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,531
lt is very unusual to see an
American in these parts.

54
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,033
You are traveling south?

55
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,934
That depends, Father. l'm
looking for somebody.

56
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,330
Someone of this village?

57
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,566
No. An American by the
name of Kallen.

58
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,003
A friend of yours?

59
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,579
No, he isn't, Father. You see...

60
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,011
l'm a lawman. l've come to take
him back to the States.

61
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,779
l know the man.

62
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,287
He is here. What has he done?

63
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,091
-Couple of shootings.
-Murder?

64
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,121
He's accused of it. He's
going to stand trial.

65
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,680
Kallen is a very strange man.

66
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,217
-l have not been happy to see him
here.

67
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,684
-He's caused trouble?

68
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,978
He has not been trouble. My
people like him.

69
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:33,091
His father was Mexican, so
they understand him.

70
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,461
Ordinarily, l would be at peace
with him myself...

71
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,497
but there is another matter.
A woman.

72
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,368
She has left her parents'
house for him.

73
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,232
You see, this is my village.

74
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:52,372
The woman is one of my own
family. A cousin.

75
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,943
l have searched within
myself to know...

76
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,885
that it would be the same degree of
sin, were it anyone else.

77
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,325
But what Kallen is doing has
weakened me in the eyes of my ...

78
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,519
and it is not good for them.

79
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,128
Father, l wouldn't know about it.

80
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,195
Has he been wearing his
guns down here?

81
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,202
All those times l have
seen him, no.

82
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,372
lf he has not, he'll have them on
when l go for him.

83
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,733
Will there be shooting? You
will have to do this?

84
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,980
l don't want to. He's probably
better than me.

85
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,983
l hear he's better than most
people with a gun.

86
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,151
You are afraid?

87
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,584
l'd just as soon be home.

88
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,551
God is with you.

89
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,498
l never thought about that, Padre.

90
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,772
Where does he live?

91
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,508
You leave here and continue
through the village...

92
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,669
and a little way further,
it is a place...

93
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,643
in the clearing. You
cannot miss it.

94
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,312
Thank you, Father.

95
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,825
-Señor Hamish.
-Yes, Father?

96
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,754
-l am coming with you.
-No.

97
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,020
There are two lives here.

98
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:21,534
The man who is in your hands, and
the girl who is in mine.

99
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,169
We both serve the same law.

100
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,137
Seems to me a dead priest is about
as useless as a...

101
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,002
dead deputy, Father.

102
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,408
lt is not far. l will
walk with you.

103
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,239
Hold it, Father.

104
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,047
-You better stay here, Father.
-No.

105
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,050
-He might start shooting.
-l told you, not when l am with you.

106
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,781
Wait a minute.

107
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:17,954
Kallen.

108
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,518
Kallen.

109
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,362
Where has he gone?

110
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,246
You don't speak Spanish?

111
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,154
No.

112
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,992
We was out chasing a pig.

113
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,129
You looking for somebody?

114
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,493
That's right. l've come to take you
back to Scottsville for trial.

115
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:38,935
Elena...

116
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,472
Will you put on some coffee?

117
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,587
-Will you put on the coffee?
-No!

118
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,892
She ain't very hospitable.

119
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,259
You've come a long way.
You must be tired.

120
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,228
Why don't you put that thing away?

121
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,049
You here with him, Padre?

122
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,657
Roberto, Elena does not belong with
you this way. lt is wrong.

123
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,458
Why not? She's happy.

124
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,789
She's really happy.

125
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,133
We're both happy just as we are.

126
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,439
You put on the coffee!

127
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,777
l don't think anybody
wants any coffee.

128
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,777
l do.

129
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,516
l don't recollect your name.

130
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,317
Hamish.

131
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,111
l'm going to take you back now and
l don't want any trouble.

132
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,525
How you going to avoid it,
Mr. Hamish?

133
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,589
lt's a long ride back.

134
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,292
lf we get started now, we can make
some time before nightfall.

135
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,371
-l reckon l better get my gear.
-Stay where you are.

136
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,307
A man can't travel without
his stuff.

137
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,642
Does that include his guns? Seems
to me l've heard about them.

138
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,948
Likely you're going to hang
because of them.

139
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,217
How come they sent you after me?

140
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,151
Man...

141
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,189
-You don't look to me like you're
much.

142
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,087
-l'm not.

143
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,025
You go. He do nothing!

144
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,276
Get back! Get out of my way!

145
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,775
-Step aside, Father!
-Give me the gun.

146
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,783
-You're gonna get killed!
-Give it to me!

147
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,787
The people like you, but they
will not let you kill me.

148
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,388
And l will not allow you
to kill him.

149
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,358
With a priest and a
woman to protect...

150
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,127
you, you do okay.

151
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,428
Why don't you get the rest
of your things?

152
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,437
Thank you, Padre.

153
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,440
Come on!

154
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,611
Do you mind lf l say goodbye?

155
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,747
Not from right there, no.

156
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,778
You had better watch him.

157
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,791
He has given up, only, l think,
because of this.

158
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,293
-l thought it the best thing to do.
-l know, Father.

159
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,566
Will you stop worrying about that?
l told you l was coming back.

160
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,506
He's scared. Look at him.

161
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,676
A scared man makes mistakes.

162
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,073
You got a jacket? lt gets
cold at night.

163
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,851
l won't be needing it.

164
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,114
l ain't going far.

165
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,392
l'm just going for a short ride.

166
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,227
You just be waiting.

167
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:53,524
They don't want me to go. lf l say
the word, they'll kill you.

168
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,195
You going to say the word?

169
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,831
l can do my own killing.

170
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,157
Don't let the priest change you.
l like you just as you are.

171
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:38,695
Here.

172
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,430
Fill these, will you?

173
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:42,665
Sure.

174
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,538
What are you going to do
when we camp?

175
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,608
You going to stay awake all night?

176
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,478
l'll rope and shackle
you if l have to.

177
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,114
You'll need two hands for that.

178
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,151
Think you can handle
me without a gun?

179
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,085
Come on, hurry it up.

180
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,622
With all the traveling
we've got ahead,...

181
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,556
you've got some mighty
big problems, man.

182
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,223
Throw me that one.

183
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,861
Here, fill it yourself.

184
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,025
Get over there. Come on.

185
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,171
Man, you're sure nervous.

186
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,938
That's right. l am.

187
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,587
lt's gonna be a nice night.

188
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,191
Elena's going to be waiting.

189
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,997
Come on, let me go back.

190
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,937
This is Mexico. Nobody's
going to blame you.

191
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,304
You can't take me back to
Scottsville, you know it.

192
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,239
Come on, you're holding us up.

193
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,245
Just trying to make it
easy for you, man.

194
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,407
We'll make camp here.

195
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,383
You want to gather some
wood for a fire?

196
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,351
You afraid of the dark?

197
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,287
Get back!

198
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:50,962
Get back!

199
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,565
Go on, get back.

200
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:01,267
You're lucky. l almost
got you. Next time.

201
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,672
There isn't gonna be a next time.
l'm going to tell you something.

202
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,608
l don't like any part of this job.

203
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,110
l've got a wife who didn't want me
to come down here.

204
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,670
l don't like this.

205
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,781
But l've got to take you back and
l'm going to do it.

206
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:16,684
l know you're a better gun than me,
but you haven't got a gun.

207
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,657
You try and run or jump me again
and l'll kill you.

208
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,360
You hear what l'm saying?

209
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,121
You missed.

210
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,537
We've got a lot of riding and
camping to do together.

211
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,672
You can make it easy or tough
for yourself.

212
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,298
That's up to you.

213
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,446
Do you want to gather the wood?

214
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,816
l'll go see to the horses.

215
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,162
You know, it ain't easy to
sleep like this.

216
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:01,631
That's rough.

217
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,247
You should have brought something,
like l told you.

218
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,347
Here. These here nights
can be cool.

219
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,286
Good night, Mother.

220
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,024
Good night.

221
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,847
That's enough! Kallen!

222
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,950
Tell her to get over by the fire.

223
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,897
Ask her if she's got anything
else on her.

224
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,865
Tell her to drop it, if she has.

225
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:41,797
You ask her.

226
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,801
Ask her, Kallen, or l'm going to
search her. lt's a cold night.

227
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,586
-Has she got anything else on her?
-No, she's telling the truth.

228
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:04,521
Tell her to stay right where she
is. l don't want her near you.

229
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,683
lt's going to be getting
light pretty soon.

230
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,583
You make her go back then.

231
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,737
What are you talking about?

232
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,937
She's worried about me.

233
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:01,306
Thinks l'm going to let you take
me away from her.

234
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,574
Look at that face.

235
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,011
What did she say?

236
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:37,814
She wonders how anybody
could love you.

237
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,845
Tell her to shut up.

238
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,887
Here. The air is cold.

239
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,654
Kallen, wake up.

240
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,331
l bet l slept better than you did.

241
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,140
All right, put them back on.

242
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,410
Tell her to get home where she
belongs. Let's get on our way.

243
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:12,530
Kallen, you tell him. l don't want
to go through it again.

244
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,431
Tell him the papers are in order
and l'm going to take you across.

245
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,501
Ask him if he's got a jacket or
something to sell, too.

246
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,505
And if you're thinking of saying
anything else, don't.

247
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,374
All right?

248
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:44,095
Mister, he says you is Mexican.

249
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:48,833
You just had to do it, didn't you?
l've shown you this before.

250
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,302
This is his papers.

251
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,837
Kallen's his name, he's
an American.

252
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,305
A citizen of the United States.

253
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,106
What?

254
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,668
He respects you.

255
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,381
Did you ask him about the jacket?

256
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,255
-Poncho?
-Yes.

257
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,459
That'll be fine. Poncho.

258
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,301
Here.

259
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,102
-How about taking these things off?
-No.

260
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,307
We'll make better time.

261
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,746
You in a hurry to get there?

262
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,214
Right now, l'd settle
for free hands.

263
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,540
Might give you ideas.

264
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,086
l've seen your shooting, mister.

265
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,122
Man, you've got me
scared to death.

266
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,290
How about some papers?

267
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,304
What are you going to do about it?

268
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,669
You're going to have to
stop it right now.

269
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,306
Can l get off my horse?

270
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,274
Yeah.

271
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,840
He go very comfortably?

272
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,312
l guess so. How much
for the poncho?

273
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,010
He wants 10, give him 5.

274
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,819
Here, is that all right?

275
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,125
Tell him to hold the girl here.

276
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,574
Man, when l make a mistake,
l make it good.

277
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,279
l should have killed you
back in Cerralvo.

278
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:33,019
My second mistake was leaving
Elena behind.

279
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,427
You know, l miss her already.

280
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,064
-Hold it. Hold up.
-What's the matter?

281
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,402
-Apaches.
-Yeah.

282
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,176
Just keep looking at them. They'll
come out in their own time.

283
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,310
We'll wait.

284
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,414
l've got plenty of time, man.

285
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,110
-You get a whiff of that liquor?
-Yeah.

286
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,223
l wonder where they've been.

287
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,492
You're the lawman. Why
don't you ask them?

288
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,257
When you ask questions, you
gotta wait for answers.

289
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,297
My job's to take you back
to Scottsville.

290
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,404
All right, let's move out
of here, slow-like.

291
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:11,587
Wait a minute.

292
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,331
Looks like we shook them.

293
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,729
You afraid of lndians?

294
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,404
l'm respectful of any man who's
got enough liquor...

295
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,372
in him to make him kill.

296
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:32,304
Seems to me l've heard something
like that about you.

297
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,573
-l never killed a man with liquor.
-Yeah? l heard different.

298
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,713
You heard lies.

299
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:39,876
How far to Scottsville?

300
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,085
Riding easy, another three days.

301
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,754
l could sure use some fresh meat.

302
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,190
Maybe l can get some along the way.

303
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,195
You do some of that fancy
shooting of yours.

304
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,129
Man, l'd sure like to watch that.

305
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,575
How do you like your rabbit,
Kallen?

306
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:06,808
Raw.

307
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,616
l wonder what's ailing him?

308
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,741
Maybe he smells that rabbit.

309
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,362
-Hamish.
-Yeah.

310
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,725
l don't think we shook
those lndians.

311
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,211
What are you going to do about it?

312
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,281
Nothing.

313
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,425
l know what they're like.
We're in trouble.

314
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,394
You afraid of lndians?

315
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,230
No more than you're afraid of me.

316
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,935
The meat's burning. Take it off.

317
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,230
l get in the light, they
pick me off.

318
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,606
ls that what you want?

319
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,040
That's the general idea, l guess.

320
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:14,743
Not to me, it ain't.

321
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,214
The meat's burning, and l don't
like my meat burnt. Take it off.

322
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,095
All right, that's far enough.

323
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,027
Come on.

324
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,121
lt's a fine time to be suspicious.

325
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,599
Here.

326
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:42,662
Give me a knife to cut it.

327
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,207
Use your teeth.

328
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,251
lf l decide to go back
to Scottsville,...

329
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,479
what are my chances?

330
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:58,722
l'm not a jury.

331
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,657
Those two in Scottsville, that
was self-defense.

332
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,255
l'd taken them the night
before at cards.

333
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,397
They claimed l was cheating.

334
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,163
Next morning, l was getting a
shave, they came in.

335
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,504
l was faster, that's all.

336
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:18,540
You hear that?

337
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,278
l heard it.

338
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,550
You stay put.

339
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,484
l'm going to go out
and take a look.

340
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,355
You leaving me without a gun?

341
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:34,518
You just stay put, and if you get
any ideas about getting away...

342
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,360
if the lndians don't
kill you, l will.

343
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,918
-Hamish...
-Shut up!

344
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:29,277
What'd you find?

345
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,816
They're out there, all right.

346
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,488
Hamish...

347
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,216
l'd rather take my chances
with the lndians,...

348
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,651
than you in Scottsville.

349
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,362
l'm getting out.

350
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,234
All right, drop your gun. Easy.

351
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,238
l swear l'll plug you.

352
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,509
You didn't think l'd leave it
loaded, did you?

353
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,093
You're foxy, mister.

354
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,365
l'm learning about you.

355
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,677
Take your time.

356
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,585
Look at that.

357
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,618
Guess l go first.

358
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,667
There's a house down there.

359
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:31,733
Come on.

360
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,032
You mean, you ain't going down?

361
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,204
lt's out of the way.

362
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:40,065
You can shoot me if you want,
l'm going down.

363
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,611
l'm thirsty, l'm hungry
and l'm tired.

364
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,382
-You think l'm not?
-That's your worry.

365
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,808
Why don't you ask first?

366
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,644
Hello.

367
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,078
Those Apaches.

368
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,821
They killed a kid.

369
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:17,806
-Kallen!

370
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:20,532
-Kallen!
-What?

371
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,880
We'll bury them out back.

372
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,150
That's all they are to you.

373
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,383
Something dead.

374
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:36,320
You got nothing in you at all.

375
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,392
Shut up!

376
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,397
Don't tell me about the dead.

377
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,942
We'll bury them out back.

378
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,312
''Now l lay me down to sleep.

379
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,783
''l beg...

380
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,753
''the Lord my soul to keep.

381
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,088
''lf l should die before l wake...

382
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,368
''l pray the Lord my soul...''

383
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,338
''l pray the Lord my soul to take.''

384
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,206
Amen.

385
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,339
Where'd it come from?

386
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,335
Off in the trees, over
there, l think.

387
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,813
Let's head for the ditch.

388
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,826
-You all right?
-Sure.

389
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,701
-The horses.
-Stay down!

390
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,410
-l'm gonna save my horse!
-We've gotta save our skins!

391
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,638
You're yellow.

392
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,515
We're going to have to make a run
for the cabin. Go on.

393
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,577
Now what, General? You've
got us stuck.

394
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:53,323
You quit riding me.

395
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,625
l've had enough out of you.
l can't take anymore.

396
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,594
You quit riding me! Keep
your mouth shut!

397
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:58,862
You're brave with that gun.

398
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:00,796
Why didn't you shoot back when
you had the chance?

399
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:04,263
You could have saved the horses!
You know what? You're yellow!

400
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,031
You've got a streak a mile wide.

401
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:40,434
l think one of the horses is back.

402
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,504
lt's yours.

403
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,069
-Where you going?
-To get my horse.

404
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:07,595
Come on.

405
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:16,069
-What are you going to do?
-He's coming in with me.

406
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:29,784
Here.

407
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,856
You never had it so good.

408
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,834
What are you looking for?

409
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,337
For a gun to kill you with.

410
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:00,841
-Hamish.
-What?

411
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:02,548
-O quê?

412
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:15,691
Why would anybody come to a place
like this to raise a kid?

413
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:18,531
Lots of room, maybe.

414
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:20,368
There are reasons.

415
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,110
l guess a kid makes a difference
in a place.

416
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,474
You wouldn't know about that.

417
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,617
That's right.

418
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,125
l got a wife who can't have any kids,
'cause she lost her first one.

419
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,468
What's the matter, you
hear something?

420
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,168
lt's starting to rain.

421
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,308
l always did like the
sound of rain.

422
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:04,346
l wonder if it's raining
back at Cerralvo.

423
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,618
Elena's sure gonna be mad.

424
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,954
l never did fix the roof.

425
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:16,755
That's the second thing l do
when l get back.

426
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:21,563
Man, a bed's sure going
to feel good tonight.

427
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:27,568
What are you going to do?

428
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:31,875
l need sleep. l need it bad.
l know l won't get any...

429
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,810
but l don't want to worry about
you, so l'm gonna tie you up.

430
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,603
Come on, not tonight.

431
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,271
l don't trust you.

432
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:40,382
Here, put this through your feet.

433
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,837
l could save the law a bother by
throwing you to the lndians right

434
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:15,238
or killing you myself, but you're
going to stand trial.

435
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,281
lf l have to drag you back at the
end of a rope,...

436
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:20,146
you're gonna stand trial.

437
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,323
All right, lead him out.

438
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,532
Come on.

439
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,611
What's the matter?

440
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:51,478
-There's one over there, by the
woodshed. Where?

441
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,716
He ducked behind it now.

442
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,667
We're going to help you out.

443
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:27,574
Look, kid.

444
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,585
We're not going to hurt you.
We're your friends.

445
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:35,621
You know, for a minute, l...

446
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:39,461
Me, too.

447
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,498
Twins, l guess.

448
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,198
They ain't here now.

449
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:50,404
They've gone.

450
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,601
What's your name?

451
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,113
-What's your name, kid?
-Don't be scared of him.

452
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,148
What's your name?

453
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:04,051
l'm your friend.

454
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,187
Do you know my name?

455
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,857
My name's Roberto.

456
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,492
That means ''Bob.''

457
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:17,598
Come on.

458
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,868
Cat got your tongue or something?

459
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:21,335
Come on.

460
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:24,271
Can't you talk?

461
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,384
l don't know...

462
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:44,924
-You suppose she saw what
happened? -Probably.

463
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,387
lt's a bad thing for a kid to see.

464
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:52,967
l wish she'd talk or
cry or something.

465
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:56,801
What'll we do? Three of us can't
get out of here on the horse.

466
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:59,205
-You can't leave her here!
-l know that!

467
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,605
Come on, have a biscuit.

468
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,612
ls that nag of yours any good?

469
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,012
He came back, didn't he?

470
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:08,511
lf we hitched him to
the buckboard...

471
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:13,617
you put her in the back, and you
drove, do you think he'd pull it?

472
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,059
What have we got to lose
except my horse?

473
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,427
Come on.

474
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:21,530
All right, get some
things for her.

475
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,769
Here, this is for you.

476
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:40,144
Come on. You put it on.

477
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,420
l'll get you something to eat.

478
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:57,389
Come on!

479
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,364
Come on, baby. Here.

480
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,409
You're going to need this.
Gets cold at night.

481
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,243
Hey, look.

482
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:12,346
Come on.

483
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,986
-Hurry it up, Kallen.
-Coming.

484
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:25,592
All right, kid, you stay down.

485
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,204
We can't go on like this.

486
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,375
We'll have to drop this wagon.

487
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:16,010
l don't get it.

488
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,014
Why didn't they follow us when
we first left the cabin?

489
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:21,115
Why should they?

490
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,518
How far can we get, like this?

491
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:26,556
We're out in the open anyway. At
least we can see them coming.

492
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:27,614
l'm not worried.

493
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:29,251
You shoot real good.

494
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,119
l want to make some cover
before night.

495
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:32,489
Come on, let me have it.

496
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,156
-l gotta feed the kid.
-Feed her.

497
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:38,365
Look, kid.

498
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:40,596
Will you eat something?

499
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:44,639
Come on. You haven't eaten
for two days.

500
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:47,267
lt'll make you grow big.

501
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,105
Come on. Get it inside her.

502
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,781
She ain't no hog! You don't
feed a kid like a hog!

503
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,214
All right, feed her then.

504
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:55,216
Kid, please eat something.

505
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:57,376
Come on, come on.

506
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:01,356
Eat this! l don't want it wasted!
Now eat it.

507
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:04,286
You have a nice way with kids.

508
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,965
l'm taking my problems
out on her, l guess.

509
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:19,406
Come on, now.

510
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:21,409
Will you do it for me?

511
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:22,544
lt tastes real good.

512
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:25,303
Come on. That's it.

513
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,677
Come on, eat it.

514
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:30,184
That's a girl!

515
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:34,723
Come on. l'll let you
ride my horse.

516
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:36,824
That's it.

517
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,462
Tastes good?

518
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,639
All right.

519
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:53,540
Now, you lead him.

520
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,542
Go on.

521
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,904
Come on.

522
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,060
Standing still really stalled
that leg up.

523
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,994
Come on, boy.

524
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:28,476
How much longer you want to go?

525
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,712
About an hour on, there's
better country.

526
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,782
He's limping pretty bad.

527
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:37,485
That leg don't look good.

528
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,417
lt's really festered.

529
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,356
Loan me your knife.

530
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,361
Got to drain it.

531
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,032
Easy, fella.

532
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,534
Easy, bo y.

533
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:01,709
There.

534
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:05,477
That'll be better now.

535
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:08,416
Kid, you gotta give him a rest.

536
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,150
Come on.

537
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,573
lt'll be cold tonight. l wish
we had a fire.

538
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:39,214
Not with those lndians out there.

539
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,433
She has to live.

540
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,965
Somebody will take her in when we
get back to Scottsville.

541
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,471
How far, after tonight?

542
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,571
Like we've been going,
tomorrow night.

543
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,781
With the kid and all,
l almost forgot.

544
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,986
Things haven't changed. You've
still got a trial coming.

545
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:18,920
For what? A murder l didn't do?

546
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,315
How come you run?

547
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:24,525
l'm a stranger.

548
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:28,396
-They got me already hung.
-You'll get a fair trial.

549
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:30,665
l wish l could believe that.

550
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,763
-Things might be different.
-How?

551
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:38,438
l'd...

552
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,843
stop all this drifting around.

553
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,806
Go back to Cerralvo.
lt's a nice place.

554
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,348
Marry Elena.

555
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:50,681
Make the priest happy.

556
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,327
You're going to get a fair trial.

557
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:03,592
l promise you that.

558
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:07,936
We've been traveling together
four days,...

559
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:09,938
l don't even know your first name.

560
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:11,405
Chris.

561
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:14,074
Chris?

562
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:16,710
Yeah.

563
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:23,483
Go on, get over by the kid.

564
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:43,367
Here, use the key. Unlock them.

565
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,449
l'm gonna shackle you to the tree.

566
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:54,550
Get over here.

567
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:57,485
-You don't have to do that, man.
-l'm sorry. Come on.

568
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:01,522
l know how it's been
with you and me...

569
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,991
but what would you have done?

570
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,559
Probably the same thing. Now get
your arms around it.

571
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:10,531
Don't you believe in nothing?
Nobody?

572
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:11,899
No.

573
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:13,533
What's eating you?

574
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:16,395
Why're you taking me back?

575
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,240
For the $20, $30 they pay you?

576
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,505
l'll tell you why l'm taking you
back. l'm doing it for myself.

577
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:23,412
That's why.

578
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,243
lt's not the law, it's you?

579
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:27,180
That's right.

580
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:29,051
lt's me.

581
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:30,746
l'm gonna tell you something.

582
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:33,548
l've seen an awful lot of you
in the last few days.

583
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,591
l'd just as soon change shoes
with you right now.

584
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:39,488
That's right.

585
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:42,964
You want to know why? 'Cause you've
got a girl that loves you.

586
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:46,167
You've got friends who would've
killed me for you.

587
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,270
See that kid. She hates me!

588
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:50,737
And you...

589
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,213
l told you before l got a wife who
couldn't have any more kids...

590
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:58,703
who didn't want me to
come down here?

591
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:01,511
She hates me, too.

592
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:05,343
l've never been a success at
anything l've tried to do.

593
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:08,356
l've been a failure. And that's
all. A plain old failure.

594
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:11,757
But l'm not going to be, this time.

595
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,291
l'm going to make this one. l'm
going to do this right.

596
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:17,299
That's the reason you're going
back to stand trial.

597
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,233
Because of me. You understand?

598
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,867
Because of me.

599
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,505
You're better off dead.

600
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:03,645
Kid.

601
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:10,712
Kid, wake up.

602
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:13,883
Kid. Look at me.

603
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:18,220
You know that man?

604
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,351
He's a bad man.

605
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:23,293
He wants to hurt me.

606
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,198
You wouldn't want that, would you?

607
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:28,268
Now look.

608
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,719
Easy.

609
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:48,121
Easy, now.

610
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:50,323
Easy, kid.

611
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:52,927
Don't wake him up. That's it.

612
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:55,553
That's it. Slow.

613
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,227
Bring it back to me.

614
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,405
Drop the gun.

615
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:05,339
Don't listen to him, kid.
Bring it to me.

616
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:07,442
Hear what l'm telling you.
Drop it.

617
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:10,677
Bring it back.

618
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,079
Drop the gun.

619
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:15,084
lf you don't want the kid hurt,
you tell her...

620
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:16,608
to drop the gun, and l mean it.

621
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:23,523
Drop it, kid!

622
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:32,865
You're a big man, hitting a kid.

623
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:33,860
Yeah?

624
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,303
Kid, come back.

625
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,259
What's wrong with you,
running away?

626
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:59,193
You should get your
bottom smacked!

627
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,663
Don't you know you might have
been caught by the lndians?

628
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:11,004
l didn't mean to slap you,
back there. l'm sorry.

629
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,409
Will you forgive me, please?

630
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,508
Please?

631
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:28,356
All right, come on. l'll take you
back to your friend.

632
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:53,639
We'll make a fine target
if they're up there.

633
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:57,482
Why don't we go around?

634
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,989
l want to make Scottsville
by nightfall.

635
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:02,014
We can, by cutting through here.

636
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,194
Come on. Get off that horse.

637
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:11,359
Give me your hand.

638
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,258
-You hit?
-Yeah.

639
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,128
Get behind that rock!

640
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,402
They're on this wall.

641
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:53,769
You hit bad, Hamish?

642
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,339
Give me your gun.

643
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:05,777
We ain't got a chance
if you don't.

644
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,163
Here.

645
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,402
You stay with him.

646
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:27,540
Go on.

647
01:12:58,307 --> 01:12:59,239
Kid, come back!

648
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,403
They won't bother us anymore.

649
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,236
l got my hat back.

650
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:07,409
Give me the gun.

651
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:10,344
You give me the gun, because
we're going to go on.

652
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:11,974
You give me the gun.

653
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:13,582
You give me the gun.

654
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:14,844
Let me look at that.

655
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:23,155
Easy, man.

656
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,535
l got to tell you the truth.
That don't look good.

657
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,240
lf anything happens to you,
l'm through.

658
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:42,777
l ain't got a chance in Scottsville
without you.

659
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,783
l'm going back to Cerralvo.

660
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:53,486
Give me the key.

661
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:58,693
Last night, you said you've never
been a success.

662
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:01,786
That ain't true.

663
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:05,966
You done the best you
could, Chris.

664
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:12,171
That's all any man can do.

665
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,611
Kid, l'm going home.

666
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:24,343
My wife's waiting for
me, see, and...

667
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:42,065
Kid, l'm not running out on you...

668
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:46,106
but if l go back to Scottsville, l...

669
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:52,546
Everything that's happened in the
last couple of days...

670
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:54,773
All that you've seen, you forget.

671
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:59,655
Things are going to be
fine for you.

672
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:00,587
Honest.

673
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:05,559
You follow this road a few miles.
You'll come to Scottsville.

674
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:09,797
Now you go there and you bring
him some help.

675
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:14,735
You're going to find a
real nice home.

676
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:17,904
Here.

677
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:23,208
This'll bring you luck.

678
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:24,511
Go on, take it.

679
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:43,029
Here.

680
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,767
You do what l tell you.

681
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:05,846
Are you dead, too?

682
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:16,956
Mama.

683
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,428
Come on, let's get going, if
you want to make...

684
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:55,396
Scottsville by nightfall.

685
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,131
Don't get any ideas about
dying on me.

686
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:10,300
You promised me a fair
trial, remember?

687
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:12,571
Yeah, l remember.

688
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:16,517
Come on, kid.
