We discovered a suicide,

Also, there's no drag marks

on the floor.

I don't know much about

normal,

Yes, you have.

There's one more detail
about this guy

that might factor in.

208
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:06,072

for Jacob Nighthorse.

Last week, I confronted
Nighthorse about it.

213

And Nighthorse denied it.

214
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,726

You think Nighthorse told Ridges
that you were onto him,

00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:36,202
Ridges killed himself?

218
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:39,271
It occurred to me.

219
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,577
It also occurred to me that...

220
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:47,713
Nighthorse knew I was onto him,

221
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:51,083
and he killed Ridges,

222
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:52,752
and did a pretty convincing job

223
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:55,554
of making it
look like a suicide.

It's on the res,

right on the other side
of the powder river.

720
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:39,416
Might be better
than going in there.

I can't.

722
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:43,353
I have to go in.

723

Fales: I was beginning to worry
you weren't coming,

thought maybe
you were going to flee.

Fales: What's that?

732
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:14,751
Why are you working so hard
to find Miller Beck's killer...

733
00:38:14,852 --> 00:38:17,054
When your department
could hardly be bothered

was a small town,

And our Sheriff

You don't know what I'm like.

Far as you're concerned,

you're the most important person
for miles around.

And you think you can do

745

You know, I saw Sheriffs
in the South

746
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:50,654
who literally
got away with murder.

747
00:38:50,755 --> 00:38:56,326
And I saw that corruption
trickle down to the deputies.

748
00:38:56,427 --> 00:39:00,364
I grew up around
too many badges

00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:04,101
who'd arrest a man

didn't respect them,

I got my badge

I want to protect people
from guys like you.

What would you do?

759

Not ignore the one detail
about this case

760
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,851
that doesn't make any sense.

761

And what's that?

My wife's purse.

My wife...

Never carried more
than $50 in her purse.

765

Your witness said Miller Beck
took $700 off her.

766
00:39:48,446 --> 00:39:51,648
If he didn't get
that $700 from my wife,

where did he get it?

From another purse?

769
00:39:56,621 --> 00:40:00,590
No. I think someone paid
Miller Beck to stab my wife.

770
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:03,160
And I think
the same person killed him

with my evidence.
