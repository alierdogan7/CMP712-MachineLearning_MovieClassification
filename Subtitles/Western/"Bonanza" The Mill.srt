00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,472
ANNOUNCER:
<i>The following program</i>

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:09,042
<i>is brought to you</i>
<i>in living color on NBC.</i>

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,773
(fanfare plays)

4
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,043
(horse neighs)

5
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:51,676
Hey, hey, Joe,
look who's coming.

6
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,023
Now that's what I call
a real fine-looking woman.

7
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,619
Yeah. You mind your manners,
'cause she's a married woman.

8
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,433
Howdy, Mrs. Edwards.
This is a real pleasure, ma'am.

9
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,135
Hello, Hoss. Hello, Little Joe.

10
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,136
My pleasure, ma'am.

11
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,605
Uh, Little Joe, why don't you
see after Mrs. Edwards' horse

12
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:13,640
while I help her down?

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,708
Yeah, well, little brother, why
don't you see after her horse

14
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,910
while I help her down?

15
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,344
Hey.

16
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:21,576
(laughing)

17
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,351
Joyce.

18
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,352
Ben.

19
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,521
- Oh.
- Oh, Ben.

20
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:31,157
Oh, it-it's so good
to see you again.

21
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,692
It's wonderful seeing you.

22
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,861
- Uh, you'll stay for supper?
- Oh...

23
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,463
Adam, you remember Mrs. Edwards.

24
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,597
Hello, Adam.

25
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,699
I remember her.

26
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,202
I just wasn't speaking
because I was so busy looking.

27
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,737
You Cartwrights certainly know
how to please a woman.

28
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,273
Uh, Joe, run and tell Hop Sing
we'll have a guest for supper.

29
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,808
- Right, Pa.
- Oh, uh, Ben, I...

30
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,811
Adam, Adam, uh, down in the
cellar by the north wall

31
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,979
there are two cases of Lafitte.

32
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,347
- Bring up a couple of bottles.
- Yes, sir.

33
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,348
Ben, really I...

34
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,950
Now, look,
you've come all this way.

35
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,718
Surely you can stay
for a little while.

36
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,353
Now we need a lady
in this house.

37
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,021
You know, I've got these
three grown sons,

38
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,523
and somebody has
to teach them manners.

39
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,091
Now, please come in.

40
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,495
All right,
but just for a little while.

41
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,589
(hoofbeats approaching)

42
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,070
I wouldn't go in there
if I was you, Mrs. Edwards.

43
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,239
It's nothing, Ben.

44
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,174
He's just our new hired hand.

45
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,042
He must be lost.

46
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,477
Pay no attention to him.

47
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,613
Suit yourself, ma'am.

48
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,015
Only, Mr. Edwards ain't
gonna like this.

49
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:32,085
Ezekiel, you can tell
Mr. Edwards

50
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,522
anything you want to, but
Mr. Cartwright is an old friend

51
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,424
and I'm going inside.

52
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:39,915
Anything you say, ma'am.

53
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,360
But I'll be waiting for you.

54
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,662
(theme song playing)

55
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,484
Your house is
so attractive, Ben.

56
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,820
It gets nicer with the years.

57
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,456
It's been years since you've
been in this house, Joyce.

58
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,757
Yes, I know.

59
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,961
I've missed seeing it.

60
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,431
I've missed seeing you.

61
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,024
All of us have.

62
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,760
How's Tom?

63
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,164
All right.

64
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,669
Just all right?

65
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,823
How is he, really?

66
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,292
He's still bitter.

67
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,955
He's been bitter
ever since the accident.

68
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:28,101
All day long he just follows me
around in his wheelchair,

69
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,904
and every night in front of
Ezekiel he-- he calls me names.

70
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,908
He-- he says
the most awful things.

71
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:40,013
Ezekiel--that-that man outside?
The hired hand?

72
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,016
He's more than just that.

73
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,818
Tom spends half the night
drinking and gambling

74
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,487
with his hired hand.

75
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,488
Drinking and gambling?

76
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,257
I thought the accident
left him incapacitated.

77
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,852
Only from the waist down.

78
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,832
Tom drinks himself
into a stupor,

79
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,568
and Ezekiel carries him
upstairs.

80
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,671
He never knocks.

81
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,708
He just brings him
right into the room.

82
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,278
And he puts him down on the bed
next to me.

83
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:17,684
And he straightens up,
and he looks at me lying there,

84
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:22,088
and he says,
"Good night, Mrs. Edwards,"

85
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,556
and goes.

86
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,591
Every night, it's this.

87
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,060
But last night...

88
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,033
Usually, Tom can't turn over,

89
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,403
but somehow last night
he managed to.

90
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:42,542
I woke up, and I saw him
bending over me

91
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,877
with a carving knife
in his hand.

92
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,979
He didn't move.
He just...

93
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,516
he just sort of smiled at me.

94
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,220
"You're so beautiful,"
he said.

95
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,290
"I can't bear to think
of my going first."

96
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,561
Joyce, surely you must know
Tom meant no harm.

97
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,596
I don't know.

98
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,698
He's always talking about death.

99
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,997
His death, my death.

100
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,305
I, uh, I've got to go.

101
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,108
Joyce, please, stay.

102
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,077
I can't, Ben. I...

103
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:22,081
Oh, T... Tom will be all right.

104
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,218
If only he could find something
to do

105
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,720
to take his mind off himself.

106
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,956
He...

107
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,323
Oh, I-I've got to go.

108
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,103
Oh, Hoss, uh, would you get
Mrs. Edwards' horse, please?

109
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,838
Right, Pa.

110
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,541
Joyce...

111
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,510
I don't like the idea
of his following you.

112
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,178
Oh, it's all right, Ben.

113
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,612
He'll keep his distance.

114
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:58,684
I'll ride along
part way with you.

115
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,620
All right.

116
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,418
Thank you.

117
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,925
Here you are, Mrs. Edwards.

118
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,757
Oh, thank you, Hoss.

119
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,296
(Ben mutters)

120
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,628
JOYCE (whispers):
Thank you.

121
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,229
See ya, Pa.

122
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,489
Yeah, well, I heard once
it was Pa's gun that hit him.

123
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,490
Well, that's a lie.

124
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,859
Eat your supper, both of you,
and stop talking about it.

125
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,794
Now look, I didn't mean
he hit him on purpose.

126
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,229
I meant he hit him accidental.

127
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,964
Well, that's two lies.

128
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,133
Well, that's not what
they say in town.

129
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,968
Well, that's Mr. Edwards, Joe.

130
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,304
Sure, he blames Pa.
He claims he crippled him.

131
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,905
Well, did he or didn't he?

132
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,607
He did not.

133
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,442
Yeah, well, how do you know?
You weren't even there.

134
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,678
I was there an hour later.

135
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,347
They were out after
wild mountain sheep.

136
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,049
Mr. Edwards slipped and fell
to a ledge

137
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,951
and Pa risked
his life trying to save him,

138
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,185
ain't that right, Adam?

139
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,453
They were climbing
up off that ledge

140
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,921
when they fell to another ledge,

141
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,923
and that's when the gun went off
getting him in the spine.

142
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,024
Whose gun?

143
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,526
Mr. Edwards' gun.

144
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,361
All right, then why does
he blame Pa?

145
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,397
(sighs)

146
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,299
Eat your supper.
It's getting cold.

147
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,063
(door opening)

148
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:26,739
Hello, boys.

149
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,207
- HOSS: Howdy, Pa.
- LITTLE JOE: Hi, Pa.

150
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,575
I'm sorry I opened the wine, Pa.

151
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,978
I didn't know she was
leaving so soon.

152
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,448
Well, we haven't had any of this
since Christmas.

153
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,684
You know, it's a miracle.

154
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,487
This wine, imprisoned in this
bottle for 20 years,

155
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:44,323
and each year it seems
to grow better.

156
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,825
Yep. I'm sorry Mrs. Edwards

157
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,792
couldn't make it
to dinner tonight.

158
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,928
But I'm sure glad to be taking
part of this wine.

159
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,063
Me, too.

160
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,900
Boys, I need your help.

161
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,771
What do you think
Tom Edwards could do?

162
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,439
What do you mean, Pa?

163
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,843
Well, they're out of money.

164
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,312
He's squandered everything
they ever had.

165
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,014
They owe everybody.

166
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,649
And he's always gambling.

167
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,285
That Zeke feller, does...
does he live with them?

168
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,753
Hmm...

169
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,388
I'm sorry, Pa.

170
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,657
I wouldn't want you to talk
with your mouth full.

171
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,526
He not only lives with them,
but they owe him, too.

172
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,428
Well, what about Virginia City?

173
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,096
Maybe he could clerk somewhere.

174
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,665
You ever talk with him?

175
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:29,001
Every time he opens his mouth
it's like poison pouring out.

176
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,670
Hoss, this was once
a wonderful man.

177
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,072
But he was struck down--
life struck him down.

178
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,774
Pa, I didn't mean to offend you.

179
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,676
They have a pretty good flow
of water

180
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,044
on their place, haven't they?

181
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,046
Who are we to say
that if we were struck down

182
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,782
we wouldn't be pouring
out poison, too?

183
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,917
Now, what were you saying
about water?

184
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,120
Oh, well, I was thinking that
there's no mill around,

185
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,456
and they have
a pretty good stream there.

186
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,625
We could, uh,
rig up a waterwheel,

187
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,694
build a small mill house.

188
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,095
They could grind grain.

189
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,764
That's a wonderful idea.

190
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,033
A wonderful idea!

191
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,969
Adam, I want to drink
a toast to you.

192
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,604
Hey, Pa, can we drink
to him, too?

193
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,805
He's a mighty bright feller.

194
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,973
Downright bright,

195
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,175
and a real pride and joy
to the Cartwrights.

196
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,837
Well, thank you, gentlemen.

197
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,900
Take care of my horse.

198
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,563
Anything you say,
Mrs. Edwards.

199
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,046
MAN: Well, did you have
a pleasant ride?

200
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,514
Yes.

201
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,082
I hope so.

202
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:53,719
At least that will compensate
a little

203
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,883
for all that you have
to put up with.

204
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,829
Darling, I know it's dreadful
of me to make such a fuss

205
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:08,000
when you go out, but you have
no idea how awful it is

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,435
for me to sit here alone
without you.

207
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,374
Let me kiss you.

208
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,817
Your skin is so lovely.

209
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,819
Your cheeks are pink.

210
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,412
Kiss?

211
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,157
I'm awfully tired.

212
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,526
I-I think I'll go up to bed.

213
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,859
You haven't told me
where you've been.

214
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,731
I, uh, went to see
the Cartwrights.

215
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,271
Why?

216
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,440
To complain about your husband?

217
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,308
Tom, please don't start
that again.

218
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,343
I love you.
I'll never leave you.

219
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,641
You know that.

220
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,083
I expect Ben received you
very warmly, didn't he?

221
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,851
Did you get any money
out of him?

222
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,419
Tom, please.

223
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,623
He's very rich, you're very
attractive, we need money.

224
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,727
Yes, I did go about money.

225
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,961
You know that property

226
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,664
that my father left me in,
in San Francisco?

227
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,566
Well, Ben sometimes goes
to San Francisco,

228
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,868
and I thought that he might
sell it for me.

229
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,894
(door opens)

230
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,412
Darling, what about that
property your father left you

231
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,613
in San Francisco?

232
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,281
What do you mean?

233
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,916
Five acres?

234
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,519
That should be worth quite
a lot, wouldn't it, Ezekiel?

235
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,721
Now, Mr. Edwards, you don't want
to go gamblin'

236
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:36,722
your wife's good land.

237
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,291
Oh, no, I'm doing it for her.

238
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,393
How's that, Mr. Edwards?

239
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,395
Well, she hates you.

240
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,523
This way, she could get
rid of you.

241
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,268
Now, Mrs. Edwards,
you don't want to get rid of me,

242
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,936
close as I've been
to your husband.

243
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,805
How would that get rid
of him?

244
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,808
I'd bet the whole five acres
against all we owe Ezekiel.

245
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:59,142
If he loses, then we don't owe
him anything, and he clears out.

246
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,784
Go ahead...

247
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,219
bet the land.

248
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:10,756
You surprise me, Mr. Edwards.

249
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,392
You think I stay with you
just for money?

250
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,162
You think I take care of you,
you think I carry you

251
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,831
up them stairs night after night
and put you to bed

252
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,032
just for money?

253
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,134
Now believe you me, Mr. Edwards,

254
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,670
I know I ain't fit
to tie your shoe.

255
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,273
But just living with you, sir,
and Mrs. Edwards here,

256
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,843
well, I've grown to you two
like it was home almost.

257
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:34,980
No, sir, no offense meant,
but I can't take that bet.

258
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,016
All right, all right!

259
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,144
I'll play you for five dollars.

260
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,690
Will you lend me five dollars?

261
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,166
EZEKIEL: You did give me
a scare, Mr. Edwards.

262
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:58,070
I thought I was going
to lose my home.

263
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,299
Good night, Mrs. Edwards.

264
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,367
Morning, Tom.

265
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,236
What brings you around?

266
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,472
Well, I was going into town,

267
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,641
I, uh, thought I'd drop by.

268
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,577
To see me, or to see my wife?

269
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,313
To see you both, Tom.

270
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,483
Sit on the porch,
if you want to.

271
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,518
She's picking grapes.

272
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,645
Good morning, Mr. Cartwright.

273
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,360
Well, that's a...

274
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,131
that's a mighty fine stream you
have here on the property.

275
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,767
I hear my wife paid you
a little visit yesterday.

276
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,236
It was good to see her.

277
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,205
Good to see you, Tom.

278
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,706
Is it?

279
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,376
Tom, I'll be straight-out
honest with you.

280
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,712
I made a definite point of
stopping by here this morning.

281
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,114
Got a little business
proposition

282
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,116
I'd like to talk over with you.

283
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,285
How'd you like
to make some good money?

284
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,354
There ain't much
Mr. Edwards can do

285
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,856
ailin' chronic the way he is.

286
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:29,295
Tom, I want to build something
on your property--

287
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,196
a moneymaking operation--

288
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,867
and when I get my money out
plus 15%,

289
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,368
then it's yours to own.

290
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,270
Huh? Did you hear that?

291
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,272
My wife goes
to see my best friend,

292
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,742
and suddenly I'm in business,
I'm rich.

293
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,645
What's the proposition,
Mr. Cartwright?

294
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,013
A mill.

295
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,114
A grain mill.

296
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,449
Now, there's none around
for miles,

297
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,884
and people around here
need a mill.

298
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,218
Now, you have the water.

299
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,854
I have a son who knows how
to put that water to work.

300
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,557
What are you doing,
trying to get something from me?

301
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,093
Tom, I said this is
a business proposition.

302
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,561
I'll put up the money,

303
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,830
and my sons and I will build
that mill for you.

304
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,966
What do you get, Mr. Cartwright?

305
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,901
Water rights forever?

306
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,905
I've already said what I want:

307
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,508
My investment back, plus 15%.

308
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,911
If I have that, I'm satisfied.

309
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,903
You mean...?

310
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,486
Hmm.

311
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,921
That sounds pretty good.

312
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,480
Not to me, it don't.

313
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,825
Would you be good enough

314
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,928
to let Mr. Edwards make his own
deal if he so sees fit?

315
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,796
Of course, sir. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

316
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:38,964
Never mind Zeke, Ben.

317
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,399
We've been thrown together
so much,

318
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,734
we're almost like partners.

319
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,203
My only thought, sir,
is for Mr. Edwards.

320
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,538
That's enough, Zeke!
Now you keep out of this!

321
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,741
Mr. Edwards, we have all those
people coming around.

322
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,442
All that excitement...

323
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,644
He don't hardly sleep nights
as it is.

324
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:56,915
Tom, what do you say?

325
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,884
Have we an agreement
or haven't we?

326
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,553
15%, huh?

327
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,055
Fifteen.

328
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,324
Now, you shake on that, we'll
have that mill up in a week.

329
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,626
- You make it ten percent?
- No.

330
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,720
12 and a half?

331
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:11,856
12 and a half.

332
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,233
I'm mighty glad, Tom.

333
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,368
Why, that mill will be
a great thing for everybody.

334
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,870
What do you think of that,
Ezekiel?

335
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,937
Wait till I tell Joyce!

336
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,472
Well, all right, Tom.

337
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,274
I best be getting on into town.

338
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,276
Oh, say, we can start bringing
the stuff in tomorrow,

339
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,277
if that's all right.

340
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,346
Oh, do that!
You do that, Ben.

341
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,281
Ben...

342
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,552
We'll be friends again?

343
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,155
Let me tell you, Ben,
in my heart--

344
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:41,160
when I'm not in pain, I mean--
in my heart, I never blame you.

345
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,562
It was my gun, my fault.

346
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,030
Bless you for coming.

347
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,843
Be by tomorrow, Tom.

348
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,311
Fine, Ben.

349
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,648
Thought you owned me,
didn't you?

350
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,117
Thought I couldn't even get up
to bed without you, huh?

351
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,318
I'll show you!

352
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,254
I'll take you to your wife,
Mr. Edwards.

353
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,390
Would you like to go pick grapes
with your wife?

354
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,791
I'll make me so much money,

355
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,393
I'll hire me a nurse
from San Francisco.

356
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,795
It'd be a real one, too,
not just somebody like you!

357
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,464
Now, I wouldn't get excited,
Mr. Edwards.

358
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,998
You're gonna have
another bad night.

359
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,934
You hope I'll have another
bad night, isn't that it?!

360
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,902
You hope I'll have
to call for you!

361
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,437
Where are you taking me?

362
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,806
To your wife, Mr. Edwards, I'm
gonna take you to your wife.

363
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,042
You forget about my wife,
you hear me?!

364
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,375
You get her right out
of your head!

365
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,276
Take me back in the house.

366
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,875
Yes, sir.

367
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,495
Ben!

368
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,794
Joyce! Whoa.

369
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,201
Ben, oh, how wonderful
to see you!

370
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,903
Does, does Tom know you're here?

371
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,204
Yes, I just talked to him.

372
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,405
You just talked...?

373
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,508
I think I have some very good
news for you.

374
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,910
I suggested to Tom that we build
a grist mill here

375
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,079
and that he run it.

376
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,280
What did he say?

377
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,215
He's all for it.
He likes the idea.

378
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,718
Oh, Ben!

379
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,520
Oh, I'm so happy!

380
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,122
If only this could make Tom
happy, too.

381
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,182
Remember the way he used to be?

382
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,561
I'll help you pick some grapes.

383
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,934
Ben...

384
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,637
what you're doing is the most
wonderful thing

385
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,438
anyone could do for us.

386
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,740
Now, wait a minute.

387
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,375
You're forgetting I'm making
a profit, too.

388
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,072
I know what you're doing.

389
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:52,457
Ben, about... about yesterday,

390
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:56,895
I've, I've never complained
to you before, have I?

391
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,697
I've never complained to anyone.

392
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:04,970
But all these years
I've been dying, too.

393
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,338
I know, Joyce.

394
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,941
Sometimes I think it would have
been better for him

395
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,676
if I'd left him.

396
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,010
My health, my...

397
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,347
just the sight of me seems
to infuriate him at times.

398
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:20,152
Just the sheer sight of me
just...

399
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,814
Just your beauty?

400
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:27,459
Oh, Ben, I forgot about that
a long time ago.

401
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:32,264
He's a cripple and I'm
a cripple, too.

402
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,966
How are you a cripple?

403
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,935
Because I don't stand up to him.

404
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,905
Because I take every terrible
thing he says to me.

405
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:44,610
Sometimes, he, he eyes me
like a stranger would.

406
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,845
He says things he shouldn't.

407
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,513
This may all come to an end.

408
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,682
You know, he was so happy
when I left him.

409
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,985
I think the mill may change
everything.

410
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,453
Oh, I hope so.

411
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,421
It's going to be a fine mill.

412
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,490
You know, Adam's very clever
with that sort of thing.

413
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,125
He's made some
wonderful drawings.

414
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,728
You're so fortunate
in your boys.

415
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:06,498
Hmm, hmm, three fine sons...

416
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,734
they could be half your life.

417
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,202
Only half?

418
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,694
Sons can't be everything.

419
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,979
Did you notice how blue the
mountains were this morning?

420
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,151
Yes, I... I saw them.

421
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,068
Well, it's starting
to look very good.

422
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,403
ADAM:
Coming along fine, Pa.

423
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,538
LITTLE JOE: Hey, Pa, when's
Hoss gonna get here

424
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,874
- with those millstones?
- Should be real soon.

425
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,143
Well, we'll be ready
for 'em anytime now.

426
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,669
BEN:
That's fine.

427
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,417
Oh, Ezekiel, glad to see
you pitching in.

428
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:02,054
I wouldn't want to give you any
wrong notions, Mr. Cartwright.

429
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,256
I'm just doing this
to please Mr. Edwards.

430
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,292
I still don't think
any good's gonna come of it.

431
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,494
Well, why don't you give it
a chance?

432
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,697
Oh, I'll give it a chance.

433
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,833
I'm just wondering one thing:

434
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,636
What's <i>really</i> in this for you,
Mr. Cartwright?

435
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,305
LITTLE JOE:
Hey, Pa? Pa, send me up

436
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,103
some more nails, will you?

437
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,507
Yeah, coming right up.

438
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,914
But it looks so complicated.

439
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,416
How did you ever figure it out?

440
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,918
Well, it's really not original.

441
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,520
It... the design is
actually a combination.

442
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,789
Some of it comes from the old
New England mills,

443
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,425
and some comes from the wheels
that the miners built

444
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,893
here in Nevada.

445
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:45,130
As you see, we've built a flume
leading to the top of the wheel.

446
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,431
Now, at the proper time,

447
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,266
we'll divert the water back
through the flume.

448
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,502
It'll pass over the top of the
wheel, striking the blades,

449
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,305
which will turn the wheel,
which will drive the shaft,

450
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,073
which will turn
the upper millstone,

451
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,274
and presto,
you're grinding wheat.

452
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,275
It's really quite simple

453
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,311
Adam, I think you're absolutely
marvelous!

454
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,613
Well, actually, the idea is
thousands of years old.

455
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,349
But imagine what it meant to man
before the steam age.

456
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,518
Hoss should be here soon
with the millstones.

457
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,819
Uh, which reminds me,

458
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,721
I'd better see how Little Joe's
coming along.

459
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,257
Oh, and I'd better see
about Tom.

460
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,593
- Hey, Professor.
- What?

461
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,459
Come here.

462
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,632
That's a mighty pretty assistant
you've got there.

463
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,267
Meaning what?

464
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:25,470
(Ezekiel chuckles)

465
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,172
Oh, you're a sly one.

466
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,840
I was watching you
standing close,

467
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,442
bending over, sniffing her hair.

468
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,744
I know you bright boys.

469
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,946
How would you like
to shut your filthy face, huh?

470
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,682
Well, I'm just doin' you
a favor, friend.

471
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,317
Don't let her husband catch you.

472
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,353
He's still handy
with a rifle.

473
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,488
TOM:
Ezekiel!

474
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,286
Come get me!

475
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,393
Excuse me, Professor.

476
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:51,163
I was so busy watching you
and Mrs. Edwards

477
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,361
I forgot all about
her <i>husband.</i>

478
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,536
I don't know what you're up to,

479
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:00,405
but don't make
any trouble for Mrs. Edwards.

480
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,040
(laughs)

481
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,033
(hammering)

482
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,715
It's about time you got here,
Professor,

483
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,884
- did some of the heavy work.
- Don't call me that.

484
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,719
What's the matter with you?

485
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,822
Just don't call me Professor.

486
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,590
EZEKIEL:
Here.

487
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,858
Let me get that, Mrs. Edwards.

488
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,527
I'm perfectly capable
of doing this myself.

489
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,762
Anything you say, ma'am.

490
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:24,863
Wheel me down there.

491
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,165
I want to see
how things are going.

492
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,167
Yes, sir,
if you think it'd be all right.

493
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,169
All right?
Why shouldn't it be all right?

494
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,270
Come on.

495
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,372
I just mean
the ground's so rough

496
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,074
and your legs being so weak.

497
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,543
Must you always
remind him of that?

498
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,112
I didn't mean no harm, ma'am.

499
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,514
I was just thinking.

500
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,709
Come on, come on!

501
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,788
You know, Adam,
I got to hand it to you,

502
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,189
I think this thing's
going to work.

503
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,525
Thanks.

504
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,962
I, uh, I'm sorry about blowing
off all that steam a while ago.

505
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,730
Hey, well, that's all right.

506
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,899
I'm used to taking all the guff
around this family.

507
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,167
That's what I'm here for.

508
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,503
Oh, sure. You're really abused,
aren't you?

509
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,438
Here, put this plank up there.

510
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:09,431
See what I mean?

511
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,444
Got it?

512
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,714
Yeah. Why don't you
get some light wood, Pa?

513
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,717
TOM: Well, Ben,
you're really making progress.

514
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,385
Moving right along, Tom.

515
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:23,154
Any reason why I can't
be of some help?

516
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,789
Why, not at all.

517
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,392
As a matter of fact, I think
I've got the very thing for you.

518
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:31,162
Ezekiel, move his chair
in closer to the wheel.

519
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,898
Now, see these binder rods?

520
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,332
- Yeah.
- They need tightening.

521
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,467
- Uh-huh.
- Now, here's a wrench.

522
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,468
- Get to work.
- Fine.

523
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,903
(chuckles)

524
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:41,573
Oh, Adam, isn't it wonderful
to see Tom working again?

525
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,142
It sure is.

526
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,244
What's the matter?

527
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,580
I just think you have
the most wonderful father.

528
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,614
(gunfire)

529
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,550
Don't be alarmed, folks!

530
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,717
Just a signal!

531
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,885
BEN:
Signal for what?

532
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,754
The arrival.
Look to the east.

533
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,256
- (hoofbeats approaching)
- Hoss Cartwright, charioteer...

534
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,158
- HOSS: Hyah! -...charging up
with a ton of millstones.

535
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,029
Come on, Hoss, drive 'em!

536
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,697
HOSS:
Get along!

537
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,999
Get in there!

538
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,335
Hyah!

539
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,065
Come on, get in there!

540
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,974
Whoa, whoa.

541
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,842
Whew.

542
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,511
- Well, how was it, Hoss?
- Fine, Pa.

543
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,479
Have any trouble getting
this load across the river?

544
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,747
No, not a bit.

545
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,409
- Beats swimming with it.
- (chuckles)

546
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,420
BEN:
Hey, can we get that?

547
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,355
LITTLE JOE:
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

548
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,426
Well, I don't know about you,
Mr. Edwards,

549
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,629
but I always go by the rule
you ought to lock the barn

550
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,497
<i>before</i> the horse gets away.

551
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,666
What are you talking about?

552
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:45,364
Oh, just a certain party
and your wife.

553
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,908
You know what I think
I'll do with you?

554
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,943
When this mill is finished,
I'll put a rope around your neck

555
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,311
and hang you
from one of the rafters,

556
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,846
just to celebrate.

557
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:58,617
Mr. Edwards, you know I'm just
protecting your interests.

558
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,653
Listen, you filthy snake,
I trust my wife.

559
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:02,754
And I trust Ben Cartwright.

560
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,155
He's my friend.

561
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:07,192
And if you ever again put one of
your rotten, suspicious thoughts

562
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:10,295
in my mind, so help me heaven,
I'll kill you.

563
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,330
Your friend, Mr. Edwards?

564
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,832
I wasn't talking about him,

565
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,495
I was talking about
his son Adam.

566
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:22,007
HOSS: Watch your hands
down there with that, Pa.

567
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,541
- All right.
- Let me get this out of there.

568
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,144
Let's heave.

569
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,513
HOSS:
Easy, now.

570
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:29,581
(grunting)

571
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,106
- Easy.
- Easy.

572
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,488
Okay, let her slide down.

573
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,656
Easy does it.

574
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,923
Watch your hands, Pa.

575
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,551
Now let it slip.

576
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,363
Well, now, I ain't, I ain't
saying she did anything.

577
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,798
But the point is...

578
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,134
Look, just tell me if you saw
anything or you didn't

579
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,368
between her and Adam.

580
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,470
Mr. Edwards, I don't want you
getting excited.

581
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,472
Never mind about that!
Just tell me what you saw.

582
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,941
Well, Adam was...

583
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,844
Well, he was kind of...

584
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,347
brushing up against her
here and there.

585
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,182
Did he touch her?

586
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,878
No, not exactly. It's...

587
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,654
Well, it's his eyes, you know.

588
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,790
When she wasn't looking at him.

589
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,359
His eyes was--
well, you know what I mean.

590
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,421
They... were just kind of
touching her all over.

591
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,802
Course, you got to admit,
that Adam is a good-looking boy.

592
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:24,803
(grunts)

593
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,037
With a little bit of luck,

594
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,540
we'll have this mill
running by tonight.

595
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,041
Tom!

596
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,377
Tom, they think they'll have
the wheel going by tonight.

597
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,645
Isn't that wonderful?

598
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,346
Do you know what I think
we should have?

599
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,248
A party.
And let's dance,

600
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,784
and let's grind the first grain,
and have the neighbors in.

601
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,454
Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful
to have music again?

602
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,323
I'll bet you'd like to dance,
wouldn't you?

603
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:48,159
Well, just to hear the music
would be enough.

604
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,161
Bet you'd like
to dance with Adam.

605
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,664
I beg your pardon?

606
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,899
What's all this
between you and Adam?

607
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,367
Between me and Adam?

608
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:57,736
Ever since the mill started,

609
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,637
you've been
tagging each other around.

610
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,740
Tom, I don't understand you.

611
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,007
You understand me.

612
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,109
You're a woman, aren't you?

613
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,577
You're young, you're lovely.

614
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,712
Don't tell me you don't know
what I'm talking about!

615
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,414
Tom, on my word of honor,

616
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,783
no such thought for Adam
ever entered my mind.

617
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,184
Then why are you so happy?

618
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,220
Why have you been smiling
ever since this mill started?!

619
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,955
Because of you.

620
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,891
Because I thought it would start
your life again, and my life!

621
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,559
You haven't been
tagging Adam around?

622
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,727
JOYCE:
No!

623
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,462
Brushing against him,
leaning against him?

624
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,930
No.

625
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,966
Laughing with him at me?!

626
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:28,967
No.

627
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,635
You have, both of you!

628
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:31,970
You've been tagging
each other around

629
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,405
like a couple of
simpering lovebirds!

630
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,074
What's going on?

631
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,609
I don't know.

632
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,644
Looks like Ezekiel
has done his work.

633
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,379
Ezekiel, get me out of here!

634
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,981
- Excuse me, Mrs. Edwards.
- (sighs)

635
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,083
You got him so upset,
I'd better take him inside

636
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,584
and lay him down for a while.

637
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,654
Ezekiel, do I have you
to thank for this?

638
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,289
No, ma'am.

639
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,558
I didn't tattle on you,
if that's what you mean.

640
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,260
If you come near my wife again,

641
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,990
Adam Cartwright,
I'll kill you both!

642
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,835
(sobbing)

643
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,807
Pa, I give you my word.

644
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,242
It's Ezekiel; he's warped
and twisted Edwards' mind.

645
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,378
Pa, maybe we better
stop working the mill.

646
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,680
After I lugged
these-these stones in here?

647
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,048
We'll finish this mill.

648
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,643
Pa, a man as mixed-up as that's
liable to kill somebody.

649
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,576
Keep working.

650
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,083
(panting, sobbing)

651
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,499
Joyce!

652
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,534
Joyce! Joyce!

653
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,003
(sobbing)

654
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,105
Joyce.

655
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,508
Oh, Ben, please go away
and leave me alone.

656
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,877
Joyce, come on, now.

657
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,178
Let it out.

658
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,181
I've never been
so humiliated, so ashamed.

659
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,173
I don't know what to do.

660
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,357
ADAM: All right, now,
take it easy, Joe.

661
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,391
You'll ruin the whole thing.

662
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,660
Look, I told you
it wouldn't fit, Adam.

663
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,995
You made the shaft too short.

664
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,930
Come on, now, lift!
Now, lift, Hoss!

665
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,732
(straining): Dang it, Adam,
if I lift any more,

666
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,534
I'm gonna lift
the whole earth up!

667
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,002
- (wood creaking)
- Lift!

668
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,675
Ah, come on, will you, Adam?

669
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,644
Whew!

670
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,546
- Let's call it quits.
- Quit?

671
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,314
Yeah, quits.

672
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,016
We did enough work today
for ten men.

673
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,118
Ah, come on, Joe,
give me a few more minutes.

674
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:28,686
I'm hungry, Adam.

675
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,121
(panting)

676
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,557
Adam, you give me one reason
why I ought to break my back.

677
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,392
Because I want to see it work.

678
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,094
I want to see
this mill grind wheat.

679
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,229
I want to eat bread
from this mill that we built!

680
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,898
You do?

681
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,196
I do.

682
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,435
He does?

683
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:45,770
He does.

684
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,639
Why didn't you say so, brother?

685
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,665
Come on, let's get to work.

686
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,478
All right, all together now!

687
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:57,115
All right, let's go!
One, two, heave!

688
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,116
(wood creaking)

689
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,985
And in she goes!

690
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,147
- Hey! -Hey! -Now get the other
side over there.

691
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,624
Hey, wait till
I get this board up.

692
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:10,495
Let's go!
One, two, heave!

693
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,629
(wood creaking)

694
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:12,830
Heave!

695
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,098
- Hey!
- Hey!

696
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,100
- Hey, way to go, brother!
- Hey, look, it rolls!

697
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,803
Hoss, get up to
the diversion gate.

698
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,272
When I give you the signal,
let the water in the flume.

699
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,607
Right.

700
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,876
Hey, Adam, don't you think
we ought to wait for Pa?

701
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:28,713
Pa said to get it done,
and that's what we're gonna do.

702
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,847
Now get up there

703
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,016
and let up that sluice gate
when I tell you.

704
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,644
Aye, aye, sir.

705
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,297
All right, Hoss, let her go!

706
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,596
(metal creaking)

707
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,904
Hey, it's filling up
the flume, Adam.

708
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,149
You all set?

709
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,811
Let it go.

710
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,483
Here she comes!

711
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,699
- Hey!
- Hey, boys, it's working!

712
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,002
- Hey! Hey!
- It's working!

713
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,471
- Hot dog, look at that thing go!
- Oh!

714
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,674
Oh, mill stone,
oh, grind our wheat!

715
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,110
Oh, wheat, make our bread!

716
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,480
And, oh, bread, make us
as bright as our brother Adam!

717
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,281
- Amen!
- Amen! Yeah!

718
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,449
- Wheat! Wheat!
- Way to go, Adam!

719
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,650
We got to get some wheat!

720
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,651
Get it!

721
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,120
Hot dog, look at it!

722
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,991
Tom?

723
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,327
(gunshot)

724
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,727
Hey, Adam...!

725
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,232
Hey, maybe we better
get up there.

726
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,000
No. Wait.

727
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,333
TOM:
Come on in, whoever you are!

728
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,574
(Ezekiel laughing)

729
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,778
Well, Cartwright.

730
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:07,945
What do you want?

731
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,280
(sighs)

732
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,509
(uncocks gun)

733
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,751
If there's one thing
I don't want

734
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,453
it's people shooting at me
without a reason.

735
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:18,923
I got a reason, best reason
in the world: my wife.

736
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,191
Where is she?

737
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,559
That's right. Where is she?

738
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,261
Mr. Edwards here has been
worried about her.

739
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:24,962
And it ain't good
for him to worry.

740
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,365
How should I know
where his wife is?

741
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,101
You ought to know where she is.

742
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,636
She's with your father,
ain't she?

743
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:32,870
He run off after her.

744
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,372
TOM:
Didn't think I knew, did you?

745
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,807
I know.

746
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,508
Ezekiel told me.

747
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:40,278
I know all about your father,
too, from a long way back.

748
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,380
It's not the first time
he betrayed me.

749
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,881
He shot me in the spine!

750
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,884
My father didn't shoot you,
and you know it.

751
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,920
I don't know any such thing.

752
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,589
I know it was you Cartwrights
caused all my trouble.

753
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,858
Mr. Edwards, you're wrong.

754
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,126
Real wrong.

755
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,928
But I didn't come here
to argue with you.

756
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,130
I just come to tell you
that your mill is finished.

757
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,131
We got it going.

758
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,600
You think the mill
solves everything, don't you?

759
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,335
You know what I'm gonna do
with your mill?

760
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,804
I'm gonna destroy it;
I'm gonna burn it to the ground!

761
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:10,274
Does Ben Cartwright think he can
buy my wife with a mill?

762
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,677
You mark my words.

763
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,646
Before I'll let him
steal my wife, I'll kill him!

764
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:16,739
And her, too!

765
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:19,539
Ezekiel.

766
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,687
If you're really his friend,

767
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,922
you'll get these wild ideas
out of his head.

768
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,925
I am his friend, Mr. Cartwright.

769
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,328
But what's right is right.

770
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,820
A man has a simple duty
to protect his home.

771
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,908
Ben...

772
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,878
I'll always remember this time
we've had together today.

773
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,848
It was as though we had
escaped to another world.

774
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,876
It's been that way for me, too.

775
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,092
Ben, look!

776
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,127
The wheel is turning!

777
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,128
(gasps):
Oh!

778
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,963
Oh, isn't it beautiful?

779
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,499
BEN:
It certainly is.

780
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:13,604
Joyce, I just can't
let you go back.

781
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,872
Ben, please, I...

782
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:18,209
At least spend the night with us
at the Ponderosa.

783
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,845
Don't go back to that house--
not right now.

784
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,780
I'm not afraid.

785
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,217
Tom and Ezekiel will be so drunk
they won't even hear me come in.

786
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,353
Besides, with the mill and all,

787
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,879
perhaps it will be
different again.

788
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,219
I've got to give him
that chance.

789
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:42,500
Well... just to be sure
everything's all right, I'll...

790
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,901
I'll ride by first thing
in the morning.

791
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,873
Ben... thank you.

792
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,069
For everything.

793
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,199
Pa, we've been waiting for you.

794
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,801
Oh? Why?

795
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,502
I was a little worried
about you.

796
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,037
(chuckles) That's mighty
thoughtful of you, Adam,

797
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,707
but I have a feeling I'm old
enough to take care of myself.

798
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,209
I, uh, ran into some trouble
over at the Edwards' place.

799
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,978
What sort of trouble?

800
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,413
Tom took a shot at me.

801
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,616
- No, I can't believe that.
- Neither could I.

802
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:32,984
I went up to the ranch

803
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,852
to tell him that we'd finished
with the mill,

804
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,355
and he and that hired hand
of his were glassy-eyed drunk.

805
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,023
Well, what started it?
What brought it on?

806
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,658
I don't know.
Tom had some wild idea

807
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,293
about you and Joyce
being off someplace together,

808
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,061
and he was making threats
about killing you

809
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,597
if you didn't stay away
from her.

810
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,065
Where are you going?

811
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:50,568
Going right back to that house
as fast as I can make it.

812
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,403
If that man touches Joyce...

813
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,738
Hyah!

814
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,934
- Pa?
- What?

815
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,112
Want me to go with you?

816
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,580
No. You stay here.

817
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,648
I'll handle this alone.

818
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:04,749
Pa.

819
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,317
Tom's suspicion
about you and Joyce--

820
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,518
it isn't true, is it?

821
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,720
Suppose it were, Adam.

822
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,712
How would you feel about it?

823
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,893
I'd say that if there ever
was a chance,

824
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,762
she couldn't do any better.

825
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,493
I'd be happy for both of you.

826
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,733
Thank you for that, Adam.

827
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,375
(Ezekiel laughing)

828
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,956
That does it, Mr. Edwards.

829
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:49,393
It's my house now.

830
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,362
Your house.

831
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,798
Your money.

832
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:58,769
Your strength that packs me
upstairs and puts me to bed.

833
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,938
But she's my wife, Ezekiel.

834
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,841
You hear that? She's my wife!

835
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,845
That's right-- your wife.

836
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,315
You owe me quite a bit,
Mr. Edwards.

837
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,317
I've got a mill.

838
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,586
It'll grind flour.

839
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,488
I'll make money.

840
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:21,225
Ain't you forgetting something?
I won that mill.

841
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:24,061
I'll pay you some way.

842
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,130
I'll pay you.

843
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:30,167
Now that you mention it,
there is a way--an easy way.

844
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,803
You like to gamble, don't you?

845
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,373
What are you driving at?

846
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,641
I just want to make
one more bet with you--

847
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,810
just one cut of the cards.

848
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,812
If I lose,

849
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,682
you don't owe me anything,
Mr. Edwards-- not a thing.

850
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:49,553
You get the house back
and all the money you owe me.

851
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,223
If I lose--

852
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,955
what do I still own
you don't already have?

853
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:02,633
Well, just one cut of the cards
can prevent that, Mr. Edwards.

854
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,936
A gambler like you
ought to jump at the chance.

855
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:08,339
Somebody ought to kill you.

856
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,608
Somebody ought to stop you.

857
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,376
(Ezekiel laughing)

858
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:15,246
Well, maybe somebody will.

859
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:19,240
But that ain't going to be you,
is it, Mr. Edwards?

860
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,420
(Ezekiel laughing)

861
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,442
(laughing continues)

862
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,745
EZEKIEL: Looks like my king
beats your nine.

863
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,414
(laughing)

864
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,216
JOYCE:
Ezekiel.

865
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,015
Would you mind bringing
Mr. Edwards up to our room now?

866
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:59,390
I don't have to do that no more,
Mrs. Edwards.

867
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,192
That's my room now.

868
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,683
That's where I'm going to sleep.

869
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:08,399
Even drunk as you are,
you know that's not true.

870
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,000
Isn't it?

871
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,468
You ask your husband.

872
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,208
What does he mean?

873
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,376
Mrs. Edwards, there
are some things going on here

874
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,911
I think you ought to know about.

875
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,481
Tom, what is he saying?

876
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,211
He won the bet.

877
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,018
What bet?

878
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,154
What do you mean?

879
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,389
Oh, you're just as drunk
as he is.

880
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,051
You don't even know
what you're saying.

881
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,964
No, he's right, Mrs. Edwards.

882
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,298
I won the bet.

883
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:42,933
Tom, tell him
to get away from me!

884
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:43,934
Help me!

885
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,069
I can't help you, Joyce.

886
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,971
I can't help you.

887
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:50,708
You might as well get used
to the idea, Mrs. Edwards.

888
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,978
From now on, there ain't going
to be nobody but...

889
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,379
Get away from me!

890
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:56,981
You touch me, and I'll kill you!

891
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,283
I don't know how I'll do it,
but I'll kill you!

892
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,285
(sobbing)

893
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,387
(laughing)

894
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,083
(door slams)

895
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,529
Of course, she'll get over that,

896
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,198
soon as she calms down a bit.

897
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,866
Will she, Ezekiel?

898
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,535
Are you sure?

899
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,136
Yeah, I'm sure.

900
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,404
Why shouldn't I be?

901
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,172
You heard her.

902
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:25,643
She said she'd kill you first.

903
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:28,979
Maybe someone is going
to stop you, after all.

904
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,916
(laughing)

905
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,690
(gunshot blasting)

906
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,625
(clattering)

907
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:47,831
(Joyce crying)

908
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,300
Hello, Mr. Cartwright.

909
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,826
You should knock
before you come into my home.

910
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,598
(crying):
Ben.

911
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,984
Get out of here.

912
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,619
No, Mr. Cartwright.

913
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,621
Everything here belongs
to me now.

914
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,524
You see, I've taken
Mr. Edwards' place.

915
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:16,358
Even this chair belongs to me.

916
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,323
Come on, Joyce.

917
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,171
- (gun cocks) -EZEKIEL: Oh, now,
stay right where you are,

918
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,305
Mr. Cartwright.

919
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,975
I wouldn't want
to have to hurt you.

920
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:34,605
Now, you lay your pistol belt
on that table.

921
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:57,601
Why are you sitting
in that wheelchair?

922
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,136
You're not crippled.

923
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,538
That's right--I'm not.

924
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:04,041
I just want to get
the feel of it.

925
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,577
I want to know
how Mr. Edwards felt

926
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:08,746
when he sat in it.

927
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,848
I want to know
how Mr. Edwards felt

928
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,407
about everything.

929
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:20,858
Come on, Joyce.

930
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,260
- Let's get out of here.
- EZEKIEL: No!

931
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,728
Now... now, you can't,
Mr. Cartwright.

932
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,730
She belongs to me, too,
don't you understand?

933
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,433
Look. Look, I-I have it
all here.

934
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,935
I kept track of every bet
I made with Mr. Edwards.

935
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,504
He gambled away everything,

936
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,474
and tonight,
he gambled away his wife.

937
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:45,215
Well, if you won
everything from him,

938
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:46,884
why did you kill him?

939
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:50,487
Well... well, he tried
to go back on a bet.

940
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,513
You-you know a man
can't do that.

941
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,352
Ezekiel...

942
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,732
- You see...
- (gun cocks)

943
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,268
You're very tired.

944
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:08,572
Why don't you rest
and we can talk about it?

945
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,140
Go on, Joyce.

946
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,009
EZEKIEL:
No! No.

947
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,877
No. Wh-where is she going?

948
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,146
Just outside.

949
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,182
No, no. She can't, now.

950
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,250
Mr. Edwards told you
that if you tried

951
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,252
to steal his wife,
he'd kill you.

952
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:24,655
I'm the same as Mr. Edwards now,

953
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,091
so if you try to take her,

954
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,992
I'm going to have to kill you.

955
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,161
(shotgun blasts)

956
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,720
Oh!

957
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,323
(grunting)

958
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,663
(gun cocking)

959
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:07,865
(shotgun blasts)

960
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:08,966
(screaming)

961
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,300
(shotgun continues blasting)

962
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,292
(groans)

963
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,441
(screams)

964
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,476
Ben! Oh!

965
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,468
(sobbing)

966
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,940
(birds chirping)

967
00:46:55,946 --> 00:47:00,784
Joyce, this is, uh...
this is what you want to do?

968
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:04,421
I've had a lot of time
to think this past week,

969
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:06,857
and, uh... well,
I have friends in Denver.

970
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:10,988
I'd stay with them,
and then I'll move on east.

971
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,398
All right, you... you go,

972
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:18,135
and after a few weeks or...
or months,

973
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,604
well, then, you can decide
what you want to do.

974
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:23,173
Now, whatever you do,

975
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,904
don't sell the mill--
you use it.

976
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,646
Uh, Joyce, when you come back...

977
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:30,636
Ben...

978
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,411
I love you...

979
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,748
But I could never come back.

980
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:43,783
I need you.

981
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,964
Remember you told me once

982
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,099
that when
Little Joe's mother died

983
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:51,702
you had to get away--
had to meet new people?

984
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,672
Well, think of it that way.

985
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:05,148
Well, uh... I'll drive you
into Virginia City.

986
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,517
I'd rather we say good-bye here.

987
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:10,146
It isn't easy for me, either.
