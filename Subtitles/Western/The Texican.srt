00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000


1
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:13,841
Next time you let a prisoner get away,
try to keep him on your side of the river.

2
00:01:13,915 --> 00:01:15,542
This ain't legal.

3
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:19,878
You can't take me back.
We're on Mexican soil.

4
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,955
And you'll be eating a mouthful of it
if you open your face again.

5
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:26,458
How'd you happen to find him
over there, Carlin?

6
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:29,963
l didn't. He found me,
tried to steal my horse.

7
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:33,031
He's a bad one. 
Killed a woman in El Paso.

8
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:35,299
l'll be glad to get him back.. .

9
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,930
but you're taking quite a chance
handing him over to me.

10
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:39,633
l've got no use for his kind.

11
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:43,108
That's not what l meant.
There's a price on your head in the States.

12
00:01:43,177 --> 00:01:48,012
The Rio Grande is just over the rise.
Suppose l decide to take you back in, too?

13
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:53,486
You've known me for a long time.
l'd hate to see you try.

14
00:01:54,122 --> 00:01:58,388
So long as you stay on this side of the river,
Carlin, l won't be looking for you.

15
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:01,087
But if you ever try to come across.. ..

16
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:05,130
lf l ever do decide to come back,
l'll remember that.

17
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:33,074
You don't have to run.
Your testimony could hang Luke Starr.

18
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,479
Yeah, and that's just why l'm getting out.

19
00:05:02,777 --> 00:05:05,610
Starr doesn't know that you've talked to me.

20
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,143
-He doesn't even know where you are.
-Doesn't he?

21
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:18,285
This relay station
is only 1 2 miles from Rimrock.

22
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:25,558
He reached 20 times that far
to drive your brother into Mexico.

23
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:29,797
All right, then just give me
a signed statement how Luke framed him.

24
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,063
You're not asking for much, are you?

25
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,708
Look, l'll hire some men to ride with you.

26
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:41,179
They'll see you get out of the territory
before Luke even knows you're gone.

27
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:44,480
You'd do anything to get this story,
wouldn't you?

28
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,747
''Roy Carlin: the fighting editor.' '

29
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:50,018
l'd do anything
to make this place fit to live in.

30
00:05:50,258 --> 00:05:52,988
To rid the Cherokee Strip of Luke Starr.

31
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:57,290
And that goes
whether my paper prints the story or not.

32
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:12,412
Suppose l gave you
the signed statement you want.

33
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,278
Are you leather-brained enough to think.. .

34
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:18,841
Luke wouldn't send some men after me
no matter where l went?

35
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,048
-You help me nail Luke in a court of law--
-What law?

36
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,851
-Seen any around here lately?
-You give me the right evidence.. .

37
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,760
and l'll see
he's taken before a federal judge in Denver.

38
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,263
You're wasting your time, and mine.

39
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:36,498
Why can't you see it?
There's nothing to run from.

40
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,902
Once you cut the head off of a snake.. .

41
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:41,601
you don't worry about the rest of it, do you?

42
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:46,572
lf you're talking about Luke Starr,
you've got a long way to go.

43
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:50,845
Me? l'm getting out while there's still time.

44
00:07:03,197 --> 00:07:06,189
What's the matter?
You think you've seen a ghost?

45
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:09,559
l didn't expect to see you here, Luke.

46
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:12,932
There are a lot of surprises tonight.

47
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:21,279
Since when did you and Roy Carlin
become so friendly?

48
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,010
l hardly know him. Honest.

49
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:29,147
He was here when l came in.

50
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:33,484
At a relay station,
in the middle of the night?

51
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,956
What was he waiting for? A stagecoach?

52
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:39,257
lt's liable to be a long wait.

53
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,902
Don't try it. We don't want to lose you.

54
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:52,637
-You know Gil Rio, don't you?
-We've met.

55
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:56,279
Seems to me l warned you before
about digging under rocks.. .

56
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,114
so you can find something
to use against me.

57
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:02,087
l don't have to bend down to find it.

58
00:08:03,057 --> 00:08:04,115
No?

59
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:07,789
lt's written all over everything you touch.

60
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:12,630
lt's time somebody
taught you some manners.

61
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:14,795
Maybe Gil's right.

62
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:19,530
For a man that doesn't carry a gun,
you talk mighty big.

63
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:23,835
A lot of people don't need a gun
to make themselves heard.

64
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:28,439
Before long, you're liable to be running up
against a lot of them.

65
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:31,747
Maybe. But you won't be around to see it.

66
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:41,324
What's going on here?

67
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,730
-How are you, Mr. Starr?
-What about him?

68
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:51,633
l don't think we have to worry about him.
Get on your horse and ride.

69
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:59,406
You're just gonna let him go?

70
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:01,139
l am.

71
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,414
You're not.

72
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,385
Take your time, give him a chance.

73
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:17,030
-ls that far enough?
-Yeah, l think so.

74
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:31,309
There's gonna be lot of talking about this.
What am l gonna say?

75
00:09:31,378 --> 00:09:33,278
You'll think of something, Wilkins.

76
00:09:33,347 --> 00:09:35,645
Sure, and it won't be the first time.

77
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:39,482
-l just don't know.
-Why don't you tell them they had a fight?

78
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:41,953
They tried to shoot it out,
you tried to stop them.

79
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:44,456
You couldn't do anything about it.
Any objections?

80
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:47,517
-Sir, that's just fine. Only l.. ..
-Only what?

81
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:51,688
The one inside didn't have a gun.

82
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:11,809
-Now he's got a gun. ls there anything else?
-No, sir.

83
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:15,249
All right,
you've got some work to do outside.

84
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:17,784
Go drag Bernie in.

85
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:20,819
He won't bite you. Go on.

86
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:23,693
They killed each other in here.

87
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,238
<i>-Listo.</i>
-You go first.

88
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:47,177
<i>Tres!</i>

89
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:51,285
That throw. She is going to be hard to beat.

90
00:10:52,226 --> 00:10:54,956
l hope so. Took me long enough to do it.

91
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:06,765
<i>Cuatro!</i>

92
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,479
l don't understand, Miguel.
Even when l get a triple you beat me.

93
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,576
You have only been in México a year,
my friend.

94
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:22,952
l have been playing this game all my life.

95
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,621
-Did you have to pay for the lessons?
-That is the way of the world.

96
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:31,062
To be good at anything,
a man must pay the price.

97
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,030
-Do we throw again?
<i>-Sí.</i>

98
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:40,203
Pablo is entertaining an hombre.

99
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,972
<i>Gracias.</i>

100
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,535
<i>Una moneda de dos cabezas!</i>

101
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,079
-You weren't much help.
-l pick my own fights.

102
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:02,883
Yeah, but you could see.. .

103
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:06,892
that big bull was beating the fur out of me
for no reason.

104
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:13,024
He lost, that's all.

105
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,536
You didn't have much chance of losing
with that two-headed coin.

106
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:19,197
l'm kind of on a short leg.

107
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:25,108
l can't afford to pay
for too much drinking liquor.

108
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:28,071
Better get cleaned up.

109
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:38,291
Funny thing, you know.. .

110
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:41,424
l left Rimrock.. .

111
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:45,491
and came down here
to try and keep out of trouble.

112
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:51,294
Some people take their troubles with them,
like a two-headed coin.

113
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,431
l bet that was minted in Rimrock.

114
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:55,998
No, l made that myself.

115
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,906
-You ever been in Rimrock?
-Yep, l was there once.

116
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:03,943
Lawmen are afraid to tackle that town.

117
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,277
Can't say as l blame them.

118
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:11,786
The week l left,
four men were shot down in cold blood.

119
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:15,317
One of them was as nice a fellow.. .

120
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,421
as you ever want to meet.

121
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,530
He ran a little newspaper there, l think.

122
00:14:23,137 --> 00:14:26,334
-He wasn't even known to carry a gun.
-Newspaperman, you said?

123
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,342
Yeah, a fellow name of.. .

124
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:31,672
Carlin, Roy Carlin.

125
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:35,641
l think l'll try that other cantina over there.

126
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:41,248
They might not be so noticing at that one.
Like to join me?

127
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,785
Maybe you're smart.

128
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,807
You're going back.

129
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,044
Yes.

130
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,118
When you come here.. .

131
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:21,184
you said
you would never wear that gun again.

132
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:24,320
Someone killed my brother, Elena.

133
00:15:24,398 --> 00:15:27,595
l'm sorry, Jess.
Believe me, l would like to help.

134
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,993
l can find the man who killed Roy.

135
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,665
When you ride across that border,
you'll never have a moment's peace.

136
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,106
But l guess there's no road back now.

137
00:15:38,378 --> 00:15:41,108
Would your brother want this to happen?

138
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:48,652
No, he wouldn't. Roy was a good man.

139
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,951
Too good for the world as it is.
Maybe that's why they killed him.

140
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:58,654
We almost made it, Elena.
They were good days.

141
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:08,860
You looking for something special?

142
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:11,391
Yeah, l'm looking for a drink.

143
00:18:12,065 --> 00:18:15,228

00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:42,480
He's all right,
but he drinks a little too much.

170
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,517
-Do you want to sell him?
-No.

171
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:46,677
l can give you top price for this one.

172
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:49,551
There's always a market
for a good quarter horse.

173
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,920
Like l said, he's not for sale.

174
00:20:51,992 --> 00:20:55,155
l might go as high as $70.

175
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:58,631
lf you could furnish me a bill of sale.. .

176
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:01,394
l might even make it $75. How about it?

177
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:05,167
That's a real good price,
but l think l'll keep him.

178
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,707
Hello, Jess.

179
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:13,379
Hello, Mitch.

180
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:17,414
l thought you were in Arizona.

181
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,918
l was, only things didn't pan out.

182
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,555
You still making a living
as a bounty hunter?

183
00:21:23,857 --> 00:21:25,324
More or less.

184
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,454
ls that why you're here?

185
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:30,894
You're worth $500 in gold
for anyone who takes you in.

186
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:34,928
You can come along peaceful,
or we can do it the other way.

187
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:39,099
How many rocks did you turn over
before you found him?

188
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,402
He's fast. Real fast.

189
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:46,707
ln the old days you worked alone.
You must be slowing down.

190
00:21:47,147 --> 00:21:48,637
Wouldn't count on it.

191
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:52,014
l can still hold up my end against you
if l have to.

192
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,710
Never knew you to turn on a friend before.

193
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:57,757
My wife is sick. l need money badly.

194
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:02,057
You know l wouldn't be doing
a thing like this unless l had to.

195
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:05,655
-We're wasting time.
-So we waste a little.

196
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:09,163
l don't want a fight
unless there has to be one.

197
00:22:09,236 --> 00:22:11,864
Damn it, Jess, take your gun belt off.

198
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:14,402
l don't want to throw down on you.

199
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:18,773
lf you want this gun belt,
you'll have to come and get it.

200
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:21,040
Then there is no more to say.

201
00:22:21,114 --> 00:22:22,979
Watch yourself, Mitch.

202
00:22:58,818 --> 00:23:01,582
-ls he dead?
-Yeah.

203
00:23:02,222 --> 00:23:04,747
Better get a tourniquet on that leg.

204
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,483
Hold it, Mitch.

205
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:18,534
Still carrying this old toad-sticker, huh?

206
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:22,234
-Comes in handy now and then.
-But not today, huh?

207
00:23:24,177 --> 00:23:26,907
You know, the way you pulled that gun.. .

208
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,541
you must have been doing a little practicing
down in Mexico.

209
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,482
No, l haven't. Not a bit.

210
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:35,350
There are some things
a man remembers better than others.

211
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:36,650
That's good.

212
00:23:36,723 --> 00:23:40,124
'Cause l have a feeling
you're gonna be needing that gun a lot.

213
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:41,251
Wherever you go.. .

214
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:44,422
there's bound to be somebody
that'll recognize you.

215
00:23:44,497 --> 00:23:46,829
Where l'm going it won't matter.

216
00:23:51,071 --> 00:23:53,767
-So long, Mitch.
-So long, Jess.

217
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,203
l'm glad you're out practicing, Gil.
You won't get a second chance with Carlin.

218
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:34,406
l do very well when it's the real thing.
Tin cans are just for fun.

219
00:24:34,814 --> 00:24:35,906
Fun's over.

220
00:24:35,982 --> 00:24:38,507
Heard he went through Sweetwater
a couple of days ago.

221
00:24:38,585 --> 00:24:40,246
You can expect him here anytime now.

222
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,514
l remember him.

223
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:44,716
Also, l remember people
who say how fast he was.

224
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:47,954
But l didn't believe it then
any more than l do now.

225
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,191
A couple of bounty hunters
thought the same thing. He killed one.

226
00:24:51,264 --> 00:24:53,892
Don't make the mistake
of underestimating Carlin.

227
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:57,494
l ran him out of this territory once,
but not using a gun.

228
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,366
The only way to get him is from behind.

229
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:05,134
l like competition.
l think l'll enjoy meeting again with him.

230
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:07,309
You won't have long to wait.

231
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,372
lf he gets to Rimrock,
he's gonna cause a lot of trouble.

232
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,010
lf something happens to him out there.. .

233
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:15,048
nobody will ever know about it.

234
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:17,783
l leave it up to you
to see that he doesn't get to town.

235
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:19,654
lt's as good as done.

236
00:25:20,193 --> 00:25:22,218
Harve, Eb. Go along with him.

237
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:24,593
l don't need any help with this.

238
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:26,859
They'll just go along for the ride.

239
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,452
That's him all right.

240
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,330
Why didn't you wait, you fool?

241
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:52,044
Anybody home?

242
00:29:17,597 --> 00:29:18,962
Get 'em up.

243
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:22,928
l'd as soon blast a hole in you as to spit.

244
00:29:23,002 --> 00:29:25,994
There's nothing as low-down
as a saddle thief.

245
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,568
Get those hands up.

246
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:33,905
A gal has not enough work
trying to run a spread on her own.. .

247
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,949
without some sneak thief
coming in and stealing a saddle.. .

248
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:39,143
while she's out working her stock.

249
00:29:39,218 --> 00:29:41,812
l wasn't trying to steal this saddle.

250
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:44,088
Keep 'em up.

251
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,793
l guess you just wanted to take it.

252
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,090
-Admire it. ls that it?
-No, ma'am.

253
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,791
But like l said, l wasn't trying to steal it.

254
00:29:52,865 --> 00:29:55,595
l left some money for it there on that saddle.

255
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,135
l was kind of in a hurry.

256
00:29:57,203 --> 00:29:59,137
l bet you were in a hurry.

257
00:29:59,205 --> 00:30:01,503
But l wasn't trying to steal it.

258
00:30:01,574 --> 00:30:04,873
l left some money
on that black saddle there. Take a look.

259
00:30:04,944 --> 00:30:06,172
Stay back.

260
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,610
$40?

261
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:17,187
What kind of a fool would pay $40
for a $10 saddle?

262
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,348
A fool who's been riding bareback too long,
that's who.

263
00:30:21,427 --> 00:30:23,019
Can l have this?

264
00:30:25,064 --> 00:30:27,157
Yes. And take this.

265
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:30,201
Oh, no. You keep it.

266
00:30:33,606 --> 00:30:35,836
What happened to your gear, anyway?

267
00:30:35,908 --> 00:30:38,843
l had to leave in a hurry
back down the road apiece.

268
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:40,435
You're running?

269
00:30:41,781 --> 00:30:44,079
Right out from under my saddle.

270
00:30:45,785 --> 00:30:48,948
This is pretty sorry tack,
but maybe it'll get me into Rimrock.

271
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:50,079
To Rimrock?

272
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:52,852
Mister, that's the last place
you ought to be heading.

273
00:30:52,925 --> 00:30:55,587
Anybody who loses his saddle
in open country.. .

274
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:58,129
he's sure to lose his hide in Rimrock.

275
00:30:58,498 --> 00:31:00,466
Thanks for the warning, Miss.. ..

276
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:02,831
Adams. Friends call me Sandy.

277
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:05,930
Thank you, Sandy.

278
00:31:08,975 --> 00:31:10,670
l almost forgot my manners.

279
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:14,440
lf you want to stay for a few minutes,
l'll boil you up a pot of coffee.

280
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:17,347
No, ma'am. Thank you. l'd better be going.

281
00:32:14,874 --> 00:32:16,307
Good morning, sir.

282
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:20,072
lf you're looking for a room,
we have the best this side of Dodge City.

283
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,205
$3 a day and up.

284
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,280
$3 will be fine.
l don't know how long l'm staying.

285
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:29,151
Yes. We have nice ones on the second floor.

286
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:33,154
Plenty of windows,
and springs for every bed.

287
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:34,625
That's nice.

288
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:38,463
Please, sir, if you'll just sign the register.

289
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,698
Doesn't seem to me like business
has been too good lately.

290
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:47,136
Just dust from the street, sir.
We can't keep it out.

291
00:32:57,984 --> 00:32:59,315
Thank you.

292
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,579
Mr. Carlin, l have a fine corner room.

293
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,420
What's the matter?

294
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,157
l didn't recognize your name at first.

295
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:15,766
Now that we've got that settled,
how about my key?

296
00:33:15,835 --> 00:33:17,496
About that corner room.. .

297
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:21,199
l must confess you won't really like it.

298
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,409
lt's right over the street, noisy.. .

299
00:33:24,977 --> 00:33:26,842
and the windows stick.

300
00:33:27,513 --> 00:33:30,505
You'll never get any sleep there. Believe me.

301
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,815
How about one of the other rooms?

302
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,981
There's another hotel down the street,
and l think it's much better than this.

303
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:41,493
l'm sure they will be too happy
to take care of you.

304
00:33:42,528 --> 00:33:43,722
Oh, no.

305
00:33:44,297 --> 00:33:46,959
l've already tried there.
This one will have to do.

306
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:49,058
But you can't have it. l told you.

307
00:33:49,135 --> 00:33:51,968
We're going to repaint it. Mr. Starr won't.. ..

308
00:33:52,538 --> 00:33:54,403
Mr. Starr won't what?

309
00:33:58,344 --> 00:34:00,574
You see, he won't like it.

310
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:03,478
He owns this hotel.

311
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:05,916
Yes, l do see.

312
00:34:07,453 --> 00:34:11,253
Don't worry, you won't have to tell him.
l'll do that myself.

313
00:34:29,008 --> 00:34:33,411
The charges are a bit too high,
but we can look around and do something.

314
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:29,793
Looks like you've been doing all right
for yourself.

315
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:31,928
You didn't come here to tell me that.

316
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:34,700
What brought me here
is kind of a personal matter.

317
00:35:34,774 --> 00:35:36,139
You figure it involves me?

318
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:39,473
They tell me you run this town.
Be hard to figure it any other way.

319
00:35:39,545 --> 00:35:41,740
lf it's about
what happened to your brother.. ..

320
00:35:41,814 --> 00:35:44,476
And some two-bit gunslingers
who tried to bushwhack me.

321
00:35:44,784 --> 00:35:46,684
l don't know anything about that.

322
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:48,944
You're running on a streak of bad luck.

323
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,888
Why don't you get out of town
before it gets worse?

324
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:55,249
Maybe we ought to settle this right now.

325
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,762
You're taking on awful big odds.

326
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:03,800
So are you.

327
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:09,100
As close as we're standing,
l figure you'll be the first one to go.

328
00:36:12,912 --> 00:36:17,645
lf you want somebody to kill you, kid,
you better find somebody else to do it.

329
00:36:47,513 --> 00:36:49,071
Mr. Carlin?

330
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:51,677
That's right.

331
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,312
My name is Frank Brady.
l'd like to have a talk with you.

332
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,421
-lt's important to you.
-Go ahead and talk.

333
00:36:59,024 --> 00:37:00,958
Wouldn't want to be overheard.

334
00:37:01,026 --> 00:37:04,427
Couldn't we find some place
a little more secluded?

335
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:06,829
You don't provide me with much reason.

336
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:09,129
lt's about your brother.

337
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,870
Be at the hotel in half an hour.

338
00:37:32,558 --> 00:37:33,820
Come in.

339
00:37:37,596 --> 00:37:39,120
Sit over there.

340
00:37:49,108 --> 00:37:51,838
Not giving away any advantage, are you?

341
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:55,204
You mean the chair?
lt's just a habit, l guess.

342
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:00,017
l'm glad you came here.

343
00:38:00,085 --> 00:38:04,044
This town has been needing somebody
who will stand up to Luke Starr.

344
00:38:04,123 --> 00:38:07,422
l thought you said
you had something important to talk about.

345
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:11,827
l worked for Roy, your brother,
ever since he started a newspaper here.

346
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,690
You and Roy were close, then?

347
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:16,667
Best friend l ever had.

348
00:38:17,036 --> 00:38:19,334
l'd like to carry on his work here.

349
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:23,273
But it can't be done, not without your help.

350
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:27,670
Running a newspaper
is a little out of my line.

351
00:38:27,913 --> 00:38:30,279
l'd do it alone.

352
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:36,985
But somebody's
gonna have to stand off Luke Starr.

353
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,492
Roy's paper was always a thorn in his side.

354
00:38:40,626 --> 00:38:43,117
He tried every way to shut it down.

355
00:38:43,662 --> 00:38:47,325
Do you think Starr had anything to do
with what happened to Roy?

356
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,331
lt didn't happen here.
The story is that Roy was killed.. .

357
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,696
in a fight at the relay station west of town.

358
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,707
The story doesn't hold up.
Roy was no gunhand.

359
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,542
l know.
He was a man everybody looked up to.

360
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:03,446
That's why his paper was so trusted
and respected.

361
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:08,041
Roy fought every way he knew
to try and bring law and order out here.

362
00:39:09,922 --> 00:39:11,981
That paper mean a lot to you, didn't it?

363
00:39:12,057 --> 00:39:15,493
lt was my life, Mr. Carlin.
Help me start it up again.

364
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:19,129
You seem to be forgetting
there's a price on my head.

365
00:39:19,198 --> 00:39:21,996
My reputation's as bad as Roy's was good.

366
00:39:22,334 --> 00:39:24,325
The newspaper has a name.

367
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,272
l'm gonna be honest with you, Mr. Brady.

368
00:39:29,341 --> 00:39:32,970
l want to find the man that killed Roy.
And that's all l want.

369
00:39:33,045 --> 00:39:36,811
After that, l don't much give a damn
what happens to this territory.

370
00:39:36,882 --> 00:39:38,577
Or Roy's paper?

371
00:39:39,818 --> 00:39:41,581
Or even Roy's paper.

372
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:49,354
These pesky locks.

373
00:39:51,363 --> 00:39:52,955
May l help you?

374
00:39:58,304 --> 00:39:59,635
Thank you.

375
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,466
Sorry.

376
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:39,433
-Am l in your way?
-No, not at all.

377
00:40:39,678 --> 00:40:41,771
l was looking for my horse.

378
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:44,975
-ls that your horse?
-Yep, that's him.

379
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,554
l hope we meet again sometime.

380
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:54,217
lf your eyesight is so bad
you can't recognize a horse from a mule.. .

381
00:40:54,293 --> 00:40:56,124
then maybe you won't recognize me.

382
00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:57,958
l'll tell you what l'll do.

383
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,056
l'll look around and see
if l can find an old pair of glasses.

384
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,528
lt was nice bumping into you.

385
00:41:15,547 --> 00:41:18,345
-You ready?
-Hello, Luke. Of course.

386
00:41:19,051 --> 00:41:22,248
-Where do you know Carlin from?
-ls that his name?

387
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,846
He's the best-looking man l've seen
since l came to Rimrock.

388
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,459
You seem awfully friendly with him.

389
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,825
l've never seen him before in my life.

390
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,898
Before you make any more friends
in Rimrock, check with me.

391
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:38,130
Forget him for now. Come on.
They're throwing us a spread.. .

392
00:41:38,203 --> 00:41:41,138
the likes of which you've never seen.
We're going to Dominic's.

393
00:43:59,912 --> 00:44:01,504
Can you hear me?

394
00:44:03,482 --> 00:44:04,949
Who shot you?

395
00:45:19,491 --> 00:45:21,322
Give me my bag, quick.

396
00:45:26,298 --> 00:45:27,492
Carlin?

397
00:45:33,705 --> 00:45:36,299
-Say, aren't you Jess Carlin?
-That's right.

398
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,104
Thought l recognized you.

399
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,768
Name's Thompson. Boyd Thompson.

400
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:44,371
l'm that whiskey boomer you pulled out
of that mudhole a few years ago.

401
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:46,474
Near Fort Worth, remember?

402
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:48,545
Yeah, now l do.. .

403
00:45:48,754 --> 00:45:51,848
but you were in rags in those days,
not fancy duds like that.

404
00:45:51,923 --> 00:45:52,890
lt had to happen.

405
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:56,121
Good living and me
just naturally go together.

406
00:45:56,194 --> 00:45:59,652
At the rate people are buying my whiskey,
l'll be a millionaire soon.

407
00:45:59,731 --> 00:46:02,928
You don't want to hear about that.
Come on, l'll buy you a drink.. .

408
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:04,764
-at the Silver Ring.
-Silver Ring?

409
00:46:04,836 --> 00:46:07,532
Matter of fact,
l was just on my way over there.

410
00:46:07,606 --> 00:46:09,870
That's what l call a real coincidence.

411
00:46:10,075 --> 00:46:12,475
Luke Starr is one of my best customers.

412
00:46:13,245 --> 00:46:16,146
ls that right? Then you must know him well.

413
00:46:16,448 --> 00:46:17,608
Know him?

414
00:46:17,683 --> 00:46:22,120
l won $1,000 from him in a poker game
the last time l came through Rimrock.

415
00:46:22,187 --> 00:46:25,588
What l don't know about him
ain't worth knowing.

416
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:03,492
There's a table opening up. Let's grab it.

417
00:47:39,798 --> 00:47:43,461
Looks as though you've been singled out
for special treatment.

418
00:47:44,136 --> 00:47:45,660
-Do you want it?
-Not me.

419
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:50,003
The last time l went out with one
of those dance girls, it cost me $200...

420
00:47:51,176 --> 00:47:53,406
and all my best whiskey samples.

421
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,602
Sure, l knew there was a Roy Carlin
in town.. .

422
00:48:24,676 --> 00:48:27,372
but l never had any idea
he was your brother.

423
00:48:27,746 --> 00:48:31,045
-Starr ever say anything about him?
-You bet he did.

424
00:48:31,149 --> 00:48:33,174
The last time we played cards.. .

425
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:37,153
he was burning up about something
your brother had printed in his newspaper.

426
00:48:37,222 --> 00:48:38,746
You know what it was?

427
00:48:39,558 --> 00:48:41,116
Yes, l do, but Roy--

428
00:48:41,193 --> 00:48:44,128
Mr. Thompson,
the poker game has already started.

429
00:48:44,396 --> 00:48:46,660
Luke doesn't like to be kept waiting.

430
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:49,324
You know Gil Rio, don't you?

431
00:48:49,668 --> 00:48:52,501
-Not as well as l'd like.
-The feeling's mutual.

432
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:54,869
-Want me to carry your bag upstairs?
-l'll take it.

433
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,740
Jess, if you're going to be around
for a while, we can continue this later.

434
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,677
Shouldn't take me more than an hour
to clean up these fellows.

435
00:49:01,746 --> 00:49:03,976
-l'll be around.
-l'll see you later.

436
00:49:04,716 --> 00:49:06,843
Have you known Thompson for long?

437
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,044
About 30 minutes.

438
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:13,488
He's a talker, you know.
The kind that's all wind and no spit.

439
00:49:13,558 --> 00:49:15,458
You can't believe a word he says.

440
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:18,257
Maybe you haven't asked him
the right questions.

441
00:49:18,597 --> 00:49:20,030
l suppose you have?

442
00:49:20,232 --> 00:49:22,427
That's strictly between Thompson and me.

443
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,401
Get your information someplace else.

444
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:26,460
You don't like me much, do you?

445
00:49:26,605 --> 00:49:29,005
l stepped on a rattlesnake once
l liked better.

446
00:49:29,941 --> 00:49:31,806
You want to try to step on me?

447
00:49:31,877 --> 00:49:33,970
Get your hand away from that gun.

448
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:36,874
Unless you want me to use
the one l'm holding.

449
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:41,484
You can put it away.
And l'm gonna meet you sometime.. .

450
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,753
when you don't have the edge.

451
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:13,345
Still working?

452
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,247
Just like l was getting paid for it.

453
00:50:16,688 --> 00:50:19,179
l'll put you on the payroll any time,
you know that.

454
00:50:19,257 --> 00:50:21,817
That's not what l came to Rimrock for, Luke.

455
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:26,397
What about changing your plans?

456
00:50:26,464 --> 00:50:29,194
l don't know anything
about the saloon business.

457
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:32,735
Neither did your dad when l met him.
He was one of our bookkeepers.

458
00:50:32,804 --> 00:50:35,364
l gave him a piece of the place,
he made a lot of money.

459
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,907
Same thing can happen to you.

460
00:50:36,975 --> 00:50:41,139
All l want is his share of the saloon
that was left to me in his will.

461
00:50:41,212 --> 00:50:44,010
Kit, l've offered you $10,000.
lsn't that enough?

462
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:47,916
Too much. That's why
l've been going over these ledgers.

463
00:50:47,986 --> 00:50:51,444
All l want is what's rightfully mine.
No more, no less.

464
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:55,317
Look, you're the greatest woman
l've ever known with numbers.

465
00:50:55,393 --> 00:50:56,951
The greatest, really.

466
00:50:57,996 --> 00:51:00,624
And you know how l feel about you,
don't you?

467
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,127
Why don't you change your plans?

468
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,232
What is it, then?

469
00:51:09,307 --> 00:51:11,798
Maybe it's 'cause you think
l'm too old for you.

470
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:18,143
l don't know, Luke.
Maybe l'm just not ready to settle down.

471
00:51:20,218 --> 00:51:23,449
Didn't sound like that
when you were talking about Carlin.

472
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:27,023
lf l didn't know you better,
l'd think you were jealous.

473
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,651
All right, come on. l'll walk you home.

474
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,171
Luke?

475
00:51:49,914 --> 00:51:52,712
lf you'd excuse me,
l'll be with you in a minute.

476
00:51:53,284 --> 00:51:55,479
Thompson's sore because he's losing.

477
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,614
Figures we're cheating.

478
00:51:57,956 --> 00:52:00,322
Cheating him because he won last time.

479
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,649
So let him win a few hands.

480
00:52:02,727 --> 00:52:05,662
lt's not that simple.
l think he knows something.

481
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:11,896
-You run along. l'll see you in the morning.
-Good night, Luke.

482
00:52:24,716 --> 00:52:26,741
-Hello, Jess.
-How are you?

483
00:52:26,818 --> 00:52:29,116
-Won't you sit down?
-Thank you.

484
00:52:31,856 --> 00:52:35,121
-Can l order something for you?
-No, thank you.

485
00:52:35,727 --> 00:52:37,820
l was just on my way home.

486
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,360
-You don't work here, do you?
-No.

487
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,692
Then you must be a friend of Luke Starr's.

488
00:52:46,304 --> 00:52:48,829
You make it sound as though l shouldn't be.

489
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:53,234
No, l'm just trying to understand, that's all.

490
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:03,513
There's nothing to worry about, folks.

491
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:07,882
l was cleaning my pistol,
and it went off by accident.

492
00:53:08,793 --> 00:53:12,058
Now you can go back
and have a good drink.

493
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,867
Please, Jess, l'd like to leave now.

494
00:53:33,051 --> 00:53:35,519
A lot of people saw Mr. Thompson come in.

495
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:40,414
Make sure
nobody sees Mr. Thompson go out.

496
00:53:41,192 --> 00:53:44,628
lf a gun goes off every night,
it must be an awful noisy game.

497
00:53:44,696 --> 00:53:47,756
-You don't trust him very far, do you?
-Do you?

498
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,591
He's been more honest with me
than most men.

499
00:53:51,669 --> 00:53:54,399
Maybe you're just not
a very good judge of character.

500
00:53:54,472 --> 00:53:56,963
l'm sure l know him better than you do.. .

501
00:53:57,041 --> 00:54:00,909
and l've just heard you're hardly
in a position to criticize anyone.

502
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,774
Then why did you want me
to walk you home?

503
00:54:03,848 --> 00:54:06,442
l am wondering right now
about that, myself.

504
00:54:06,518 --> 00:54:10,010
As far as l'm concerned,
you're nothing but a common gunman.. .

505
00:54:10,088 --> 00:54:12,818
and l shall thank you
not to speak to me again.

506
00:54:13,758 --> 00:54:15,385
That sounds reasonable.

507
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,832
l don't believe you even told me your name.

508
00:54:33,945 --> 00:54:36,209
Kit. Kit O'Neal.

509
00:54:37,348 --> 00:54:40,442
Kit O'Neal. That sounds reasonable, too.

510
00:57:14,005 --> 00:57:15,336
Find anything?

511
00:57:20,945 --> 00:57:23,209
Yeah, an old cat. And now you.

512
00:57:25,049 --> 00:57:28,382
Why don't you wait till morning?
You might find something better.

513
00:57:28,453 --> 00:57:30,353
This place could cave in on you.

514
00:57:30,421 --> 00:57:34,118
Yeah, it could,
but l've learned one thing about this town.

515
00:57:34,392 --> 00:57:36,326
-What's that?
-Doesn't pay to wait.

516
00:57:36,394 --> 00:57:38,021
Things happen too fast.

517
00:57:38,363 --> 00:57:41,093
ln a border town life goes a little slower.

518
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:43,759
Why don't you get smart
and go back where you belong?

519
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,826
l'm not sure where l do belong.

520
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,694
But you can count on this.. .

521
00:57:47,772 --> 00:57:50,502
before l leave this town,
l'm going to find out.

522
00:57:56,814 --> 00:57:59,305
Oh, Luke. Don't forget to lock the door.

523
00:58:07,558 --> 00:58:09,287
Hey, there, saddle thief.

524
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:20,636
Not so loud. You want everybody to know?

525
00:58:21,072 --> 00:58:23,700
ln this town that'd make you a hero, mister.

526
00:58:24,142 --> 00:58:27,236
Don't get bold. l hear Jess Carlin's in town.

527
00:58:27,512 --> 00:58:30,242
You'd best walk around him
if he comes your way.

528
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:33,645
l'll try to remember that.

529
00:58:33,785 --> 00:58:36,845
l've never seen as many holsters.
You must do a lot of hunting.

530
00:58:36,921 --> 00:58:40,880
Yeah, for work.
l do the best leather carving in this territory.

531
00:58:41,592 --> 00:58:43,583
l thought you ran a cow outfit.

532
00:58:44,028 --> 00:58:46,997
About 100 head. Pretty small spread.

533
00:58:47,231 --> 00:58:50,359
Got to do a little leatherwork
to piece out a living.

534
00:58:50,435 --> 00:58:54,428
Good-looking girl like you
shouldn't have any trouble finding a man.

535
00:58:56,107 --> 00:58:57,836
l'm not looking for a man.

536
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:13,617
That Sandy sure is a pistol, ain't she?

537
00:59:13,691 --> 00:59:15,989
She drives that wagon like a Comanche.

538
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:19,587
Yeah, Roy Carlin was the only one
who ever could have tamed her.

539
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,955
What's the matter, cowboy?
Did they run you out, after all?

540
00:59:48,092 --> 00:59:51,084
-Not yet.
-Then what are you doing way out here?

541
00:59:51,762 --> 00:59:53,787
l want to talk to you about Roy.

542
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,194
Come in.

543
01:00:03,107 --> 01:00:05,905
-Nice place you got here, Sandy.
-Thanks.

544
01:00:06,344 --> 01:00:08,835
-What can l call you?
-Jess.

545
01:00:10,615 --> 01:00:12,776
Now, what about Roy?

546
01:00:14,285 --> 01:00:17,777
You see, my last name is Carlin.
Roy was my brother.

547
01:00:20,958 --> 01:00:22,220
Sit down.

548
01:00:25,363 --> 01:00:27,092
So you're Roy's brother?

549
01:00:28,366 --> 01:00:31,358
Roy was older than me, but smarter, too.

550
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,564
You are like him, at that.

551
01:00:40,044 --> 01:00:42,877
-How well did you know him?
-Pretty well.

552
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,210
We were gonna be married this month.

553
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,344
That's tough, Sandy.

554
01:00:52,957 --> 01:00:55,323
l wish there was something l could say.

555
01:00:55,826 --> 01:00:58,659
There's nothing anyone can say.

556
01:01:30,328 --> 01:01:31,352
Hi!

557
01:01:40,204 --> 01:01:41,603
Whoa, there.

558
01:01:48,145 --> 01:01:50,340
You're in quite a hurry, aren't you?

559
01:01:50,448 --> 01:01:52,177
l'm not. They were.

560
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:57,316
Yeah? They'd get you there in a hurry,
the rate that thing was moving.

561
01:01:58,356 --> 01:02:00,017
l wasn't really going anywhere.

562
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:04,118
l just wanted to take a quiet drive
in the country and do some thinking.

563
01:02:04,195 --> 01:02:05,355
About what?

564
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:08,193
l've forgotten what it was.

565
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,497
You're not exactly the best teamster
l've ever seen.

566
01:02:11,569 --> 01:02:12,729
No, l'm not.

567
01:02:12,803 --> 01:02:17,035
And l made the mistake of telling
the liveryman l wanted spirited horses.

568
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:20,233
His notion of spirited
is quite different from mine.

569
01:02:20,811 --> 01:02:23,803
l see. l'll tell you what l'll do.. .

570
01:02:24,448 --> 01:02:28,748
l'll drive you back to town,
all the way, real slow.

571
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,151
All right.

572
01:03:02,887 --> 01:03:05,185
That man seemed glad to get his team back.

573
01:03:05,256 --> 01:03:08,589
-He thought l'd run off with them.
-You almost did.

574
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,042
-You didn't lock it.
-What?

575
01:03:28,112 --> 01:03:31,172
-The door.
-Forget about the door.

576
01:03:31,415 --> 01:03:34,316
-That's what you came in here for.
-ls it?

577
01:03:43,594 --> 01:03:44,720
What's the matter?

578
01:03:44,795 --> 01:03:47,389
Looks like somebody
had too much to drink down there.

579
01:03:47,465 --> 01:03:50,901
-Are you against drinking?
-No, not at all.

580
01:03:52,636 --> 01:03:56,094
-lt's just that he could be dead drunk.
-What do you care?

581
01:03:57,241 --> 01:04:00,642
You might say l'm nosy,
but l think l know him.

582
01:04:02,413 --> 01:04:04,404
ls that so important right now?

583
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:06,175
lt could be.

584
01:04:08,285 --> 01:04:10,719
-Come on. Give me a hand.
-Put him up here, quick.

585
01:04:10,788 --> 01:04:12,187
Come on, hurry up.

586
01:04:18,462 --> 01:04:19,588
Get moving.

587
01:06:17,147 --> 01:06:19,115
Buy you a drink, Jess?

588
01:06:21,819 --> 01:06:22,945
Not now.

589
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:35,298
You're getting to be
one of our best customers, Carlin.

590
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:37,834
Must be that good whiskey you serve, Luke.

591
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:42,066
Speaking of liquor, whatever happened
to that salesman, Thompson?

592
01:06:42,506 --> 01:06:44,804
l don't know.
l haven't seen him since last night.

593
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:47,867
ls that right?
How about your bootlicker here?

594
01:06:47,945 --> 01:06:51,779
Gil doesn't know anything about him.
We've been here all evening, drinking.

595
01:06:51,849 --> 01:06:54,511
-That's right.
-Like hell you have.

596
01:06:59,456 --> 01:07:02,516
That's a real hot gun
you got working for you, Luke.

597
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:06,261
What are you doing, Carlin?
Trying to start trouble with me?

598
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:08,594
With you that'd be no trouble at all.

599
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,566
l guess Eb didn't want him
as bad as he thought he did.

600
01:09:21,865 --> 01:09:24,766
lt's good to see Luke's bullyboy
get a licking.

601
01:09:28,739 --> 01:09:30,434
He almost didn't get it.

602
01:09:30,507 --> 01:09:34,238
Too bad you didn't get a shot at Luke
while you were at it.

603
01:09:35,245 --> 01:09:36,337
Sure.

604
01:09:36,413 --> 01:09:40,543
Exactly what l wanted to talk to you about.

605
01:09:41,018 --> 01:09:43,953
There are a lot of good men in this town.

606
01:09:44,021 --> 01:09:47,115
They asked me to say
they would stand behind you.. .

607
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:49,824
if you would help drive out Luke Starr.

608
01:09:50,961 --> 01:09:52,155
That's the trouble.

609
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:55,460
A man gets good with a gun,
he's always being forced to use it.

610
01:09:55,532 --> 01:09:57,261
l hung this up once.

611
01:09:57,334 --> 01:10:00,064
And when l get Roy's killer,
l'm gonna hang it up again.

612
01:10:00,137 --> 01:10:02,469
l can see l was wrong about you.

613
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,935
l thought because you were Roy's brother.. .

614
01:10:05,008 --> 01:10:07,772
that you would be like him.

615
01:10:10,881 --> 01:10:12,872
Roy and l were alike once.

616
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:17,343
We moved into a little town in Texas.
lt was a rough little place.

617
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,252
We thought it needed changing.

618
01:10:19,323 --> 01:10:22,952
Roy opened up a newspaper,
and the town made me the sheriff.

619
01:10:23,026 --> 01:10:26,962
Between his editorials and my gun,
we turned that place upside down.

620
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:28,930
That's what we need here.

621
01:10:29,233 --> 01:10:30,325
Sure.

622
01:10:30,534 --> 01:10:34,493
Only trouble was, the people we helped
were worse than the ones we ran out.

623
01:10:34,571 --> 01:10:37,870
l didn't think
you'd give up so easy, Mr. Carlin.

624
01:10:39,309 --> 01:10:42,437
Seems to me this town gave up
before l even rode in here.

625
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,972
Good night, Mr. Brady.

626
01:11:08,372 --> 01:11:09,566
Who is it?

627
01:11:09,873 --> 01:11:12,171
l'd like to talk with you, Mr. Carlin.

628
01:11:19,016 --> 01:11:21,712
You can put your gun away.
No one came with me.

629
01:11:26,223 --> 01:11:27,884
Am l supposed to know you?

630
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:31,121
No. l'm working for Luke Starr in the saloon.

631
01:11:32,062 --> 01:11:35,828
-Did he send you here?
-No, he doesn't know anything about it.

632
01:11:36,233 --> 01:11:38,133
l'd like to keep it that way.

633
01:11:38,435 --> 01:11:40,266
My name is Maria Banta.

634
01:11:42,873 --> 01:11:45,501
-Won't you sit down?
-Thank you.

635
01:11:47,544 --> 01:11:48,943
l won't stay long.

636
01:11:50,214 --> 01:11:53,479
l heard you're trying to find out
who murdered your brother.

637
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:54,642
Yes, l am.

638
01:11:54,985 --> 01:11:57,749
My husband was killed
the same night he was.

639
01:11:58,121 --> 01:12:01,181
They're supposed to have shot each other
in a gunfight.

640
01:12:01,391 --> 01:12:04,292
So l've been told. Can you prove otherwise?

641
01:12:04,661 --> 01:12:06,993
No. But l knew your brother.

642
01:12:07,231 --> 01:12:09,131
He never even carried a gun.

643
01:12:09,266 --> 01:12:11,962
l still don't understand
why you're concerned about me.

644
01:12:12,035 --> 01:12:13,502
l loved my husband.

645
01:12:14,338 --> 01:12:16,067
Even if he wasn't much.

646
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,006
And l guess l rate even less.

647
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:23,001
But he was just trying to break away
from Luke Starr when he was killed.

648
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:27,016
And l don't want to see the same thing
happen to you.

649
01:12:28,151 --> 01:12:30,085
And it will if you stay here.

650
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:34,482
l'm staying until l finish what l came for.

651
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:37,186
Thanks for the warning.

652
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:45,133
-Mr. Carlin.
-Yes?

653
01:12:45,836 --> 01:12:46,962
Be careful.

654
01:13:20,203 --> 01:13:21,636
Where is everybody?

655
01:13:21,972 --> 01:13:25,100
Eb's still licking his wounds
from the fight last night.

656
01:13:34,918 --> 01:13:37,614
-Gil, where you been?
-Right outside, Luke.

657
01:13:37,688 --> 01:13:40,418
-Seen anything of Kit?
-Yeah, l saw her.

658
01:13:40,691 --> 01:13:45,094
She and your friend Carlin are having
a cozy breakfast together over at Dominic's.

659
01:13:45,862 --> 01:13:47,921
She kept me waiting more than an hour.

660
01:13:47,998 --> 01:13:52,059
As long as she's got Carlin,
she's likely to keep you waiting forever.

661
01:14:00,911 --> 01:14:04,574
Don't ever draw on me again, Gil.
lf you do, l'll kill you.

662
01:14:05,749 --> 01:14:07,216
Now put it away.

663
01:14:14,091 --> 01:14:15,456
Give me a drink.

664
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:38,445
l've been waiting here since 9:00.

665
01:14:38,515 --> 01:14:39,812
l'm sorry, Luke.

666
01:14:39,883 --> 01:14:43,114
l guess l was enjoying
that second cup of coffee too much.

667
01:14:43,253 --> 01:14:45,187
ls that all you were enjoying?

668
01:14:46,089 --> 01:14:47,488
What if it wasn't?

669
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,985
l don't like the company you keep.

670
01:14:52,996 --> 01:14:56,454
Let's get something straight.
l'll pick my own friends.

671
01:15:01,071 --> 01:15:04,871
Can't push her around like those
lamebrain gunfighters of yours, can you?

672
01:15:04,941 --> 01:15:09,173
You know, we've all got our weaknesses.
Mine is l'm a bad loser.

673
01:15:09,579 --> 01:15:11,672
You might have to get used to it.

674
01:15:12,082 --> 01:15:15,313
l got a better way. l fix it so l always win.

675
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:19,177
You see those doors?

676
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:23,215
lf you aren't out of town
when the sun hits them.. .

677
01:15:23,293 --> 01:15:25,454
you ain't gonna live to see it set.

678
01:15:37,874 --> 01:15:39,432
Good morning, Jess.

679
01:15:39,876 --> 01:15:41,173
Morning, Sandy.

680
01:15:42,312 --> 01:15:44,644
Luke's very unhappy about something.

681
01:15:44,714 --> 01:15:47,308
He just suggested my welcome
had about worn out.

682
01:15:47,384 --> 01:15:49,682
He's got the guns to back it up, Jess.

683
01:15:50,253 --> 01:15:53,814
l've still got a couple hours.
Maybe something will turn up.

684
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:56,552
l'll be out at the ranch if you need me.

685
01:15:56,626 --> 01:15:59,595
-Thanks, Sandy.
<i>-Adios.</i> Giddap!

686
01:16:22,752 --> 01:16:25,880
Did you lay over at that way station
west of town last night?

687
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:30,154
Yeah, always do. Not bad out there.
They fixed it up since Wilkins got killed.

688
01:16:30,227 --> 01:16:33,219
When he was alive, did he say anything
about those two shootings?

689
01:16:33,296 --> 01:16:35,321
-You mean Carlin and Banta?
-Yes.

690
01:16:35,398 --> 01:16:38,697
No, he didn't say too much,
that closed-mouth old coot.

691
01:16:38,902 --> 01:16:42,702
-Did what he did say make sense to you?
-No reason to believe different.

692
01:16:42,772 --> 01:16:45,297
l brought the bodies in.
They were both dead enough.

693
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:48,811
-Why are you so interested in it?
-l knew one of them.

694
01:16:49,112 --> 01:16:52,275
Why don't you go over
and see the coroner there, old Doc Miller?

695
01:16:52,349 --> 01:16:55,876
-Maybe he can give you an opinion on it.
-l'll do that. Thanks.

696
01:17:15,872 --> 01:17:16,998
Come in.

697
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:22,337
From the look on your face.. .

698
01:17:22,412 --> 01:17:25,108
l guess l don't have to ask you
how things are.

699
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:27,877
Come on. You better sit down.

700
01:17:28,418 --> 01:17:29,908
l don't know, Sandy.

701
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,748
Maybe l've got this whole thing
figured wrong.

702
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:35,256
l can't find out any information.. .

703
01:17:35,358 --> 01:17:38,122
and l can't go shooting up the town
until l do.

704
01:17:45,468 --> 01:17:46,833
-Sandy.
-Yes?

705
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:49,732
Did you ever see a concho like this?

706
01:17:52,275 --> 01:17:53,799
Looks familiar.

707
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:08,854
You saved me some work.

708
01:18:11,428 --> 01:18:12,952
Where'd you find it?

709
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:15,521
Never mind. Whose belt is that?

710
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,728
They're marked.

711
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,637
Luke Starr.

712
01:18:28,011 --> 01:18:31,845
You know something, Sandy?
l'll bet you make real good coffee.

713
01:19:56,232 --> 01:19:57,859
Looking for me?

714
01:19:58,301 --> 01:20:00,963
Yeah. Looking to bury you.

715
01:20:01,137 --> 01:20:02,866
What are you waiting for?

716
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:05,762
l wouldn't, if l were you.

717
01:21:13,943 --> 01:21:15,035
Easy, boys.

718
01:21:19,115 --> 01:21:20,605
Private game, Luke?

719
01:21:21,217 --> 01:21:23,048
You're pretty hard on doors.

720
01:21:24,687 --> 01:21:26,678
You could have walked right in.

721
01:21:26,823 --> 01:21:30,953
Ran into some of your boys
down on the street. They had other ideas.

722
01:21:32,295 --> 01:21:34,195
l thought l heard some shots.

723
01:21:34,998 --> 01:21:36,932
l guess Gil lost the argument.

724
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:38,698
All of them did.

725
01:21:39,235 --> 01:21:42,796
Drag the bodies out of the street.
lt might give the place a bad name.

726
01:21:42,872 --> 01:21:44,032
Sit down.

727
01:21:45,141 --> 01:21:46,267
lt'll keep.

728
01:21:48,344 --> 01:21:49,743
lt's an open game.

729
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,079
Want to sit there?

730
01:21:52,482 --> 01:21:54,279
That seat might be unlucky.

731
01:21:55,552 --> 01:21:57,019
l'll sit over here.

732
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,450
lf you don't mind.

733
01:22:07,063 --> 01:22:08,860
How much you sitting in for?

734
01:22:12,602 --> 01:22:14,229
How much will that buy?

735
01:22:19,709 --> 01:22:21,734
This won't even buy you an ante.

736
01:22:22,912 --> 01:22:24,709
l'm surprised at you, Luke.

737
01:22:25,915 --> 01:22:28,941
l thought you'd give me a good-sized stack
for that concho.

738
01:22:29,018 --> 01:22:30,815
What's so special about it?

739
01:22:31,254 --> 01:22:32,949
Take another look at it.

740
01:22:36,559 --> 01:22:37,821
All right. So?

741
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:41,122
Because it fits that empty space
in your other gun belt.

742
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,331
You might be right. lt could be mine.
Maybe l should thank you for it.

743
01:22:47,403 --> 01:22:48,870
Where'd it turn up?

744
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:50,802
Under Roy Carlin's body.

745
01:22:50,907 --> 01:22:53,467
Stage driver found it
when he brought him in.

746
01:22:54,077 --> 01:22:57,012
l know you're lying.
There's no need to talk about it.

747
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,640
Now stand up
and put your gun on the table.

748
01:23:02,118 --> 01:23:04,586
You don't think it's gonna be that easy,
do you?

749
01:23:04,654 --> 01:23:08,351
lt'd be a lot easier if there's a .45
pointed right at your back.

750
01:23:15,665 --> 01:23:17,792
This the way you took care of Roy?

751
01:23:19,068 --> 01:23:21,002
Just about the same way, yeah.

752
01:23:21,337 --> 01:23:24,431
That figures.
You're a real gambler, aren't you?

753
01:23:24,507 --> 01:23:27,032
The odds were against you
the minute you walked in.

754
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:30,944
Get the bodies out of the street
and get them over to Doc Miller.

755
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:34,778
-All right, get him out of here.
-Get going.

756
01:23:42,592 --> 01:23:45,220
Take him downstairs.
l'll be down in a minute.

757
01:23:52,435 --> 01:23:54,903
lf you feel like running, go ahead.

758
01:23:54,971 --> 01:23:57,166
Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

759
01:24:40,249 --> 01:24:42,809
The odds don't always hold up,
do they, Luke?

760
01:25:24,327 --> 01:25:27,353
l told you l'd be walking you home
sometime, remember?

761
01:25:27,964 --> 01:25:30,091
That's right. You did, didn't you?

762
01:25:30,299 --> 01:25:33,268
What you've done today
should make up for a lot of things.

763
01:25:33,336 --> 01:25:34,826
Could work out that way.. .

764
01:25:34,904 --> 01:25:37,498
but l still have some settling up to do
with the law.

765
01:25:37,573 --> 01:25:38,972
Take me with you.

766
01:25:41,077 --> 01:25:44,274
-l can't.
-Don't make me say, ''l'll wait for you.' '

767
01:25:44,881 --> 01:25:46,405
l hate waiting.

768
01:25:50,286 --> 01:25:51,514
So do l.

769
01:25:52,514 --> 01:26:02,514
paps
