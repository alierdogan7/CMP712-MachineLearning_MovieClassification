You know, I'm being real
friendly like to you women...

172
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,520
and I can't even get
a simple hello in return?

173
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,462
Hello.

174
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,364
- Excuse me?
- You said you wanted a hello. I gave you one.

175
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,235
- I wanted it from these ladies.
- Well, it seems they don't want conversation with you.

176
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,364
Well, you two ought to mind
your own business.

177
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,205
Now... Ah...
Ladies, you don't have to go nowhere.

178
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,375
Daniel, we isn’t looking for no trouble.

179
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,749
No, we're not.
But it seems like these two boys are.

180
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,583
No, we isn’t looking for trouble.

181
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,715
But if you insist, we can step outside.

182
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:11,286
Look at it this way.
Walk away now, and you don't get hurt.

183
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,298
John, Samuel, what is going' on?

184
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,732
What's it going to be? The streets...

185
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,736
or walk away?

186
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,635
- {Woman Screams}
- {All Gasp}

187
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,937
{All Grunting}

188
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,603
Stop it!

189
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,508
{Shouting}

190
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,653
{Gasps} Stop it.

191
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,189
{Millie}
You listen to me. I said stop it!

192
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,348
Stop it!

193
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,495
- {Shouting}
- {Rose} I got the flour.

194
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,689
{Screams}

195
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,699
{Grunting}

196
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,478
Get up!

197
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,378
I will shoot the man
who throws the next punch.

198
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,787
Matter of fact,
this old scattershot isn’t too choosy.

199
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,827
She might just get all of you.
Put your hands up and sit down.

200
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,828
- But, Sheriff, these two...
- I said sit.

201
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,932
{Man}
Run those boys out of town.

202
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,297
{Woman}
They need to cool their heels, Sheriff.

203
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,235
{Chattering}

204
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,305
Millicent!

205
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,374
- I'd like to know what happened here.
- Well, I was in the kitchen.

206
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,677
Ellen came to get me,
and I came out just as the fight started.

207
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,746
Well, let's get this sorted out, boys.

208
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,069
Step inside, gentlemen.

209
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,737
Uh, our horses are tied up on the street.

210
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,872
Don't go fretting about your horses.
I'll see they end up at the stables.

211
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,950
Of course, it'll cost you for board.

212
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,878
Pick a bunk.

213
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,154
{Sighs}

214
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,523
I'm not sure how this is real fair, Sheriff.
Those two boys were just as guilty as we were.

215
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,358
Witnesses say your friend here
threw the first punch.

216
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,796
- Well, they provoked me.
- Is that all you have to say?

217
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,428
What about you?
What do you got to say for yourself?

218
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,903
Never did get a chance to eat.
Little hungry.

219
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,839
I'll order you up some food from Millie's.

220
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,644
If she'll feed you after what happened.

221
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,714
I'm much obliged, Sheriff.

222
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,588
"Never did get a chance to eat"?

223
00:14:56,695 --> 00:15:00,187
That... That's all you've got to say?
We just got railroaded.

224
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,168
You caused this, again, and you know it.

225
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,743
The next big wind, and this is coming down.

226
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,281
That's why we'll have to
get the newest posts in before then.

227
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,283
You and me aren't so good
at digging postholes.

228
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,250
We'll learn. Grab the hammer and nails.

229
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,981
We'll get the plank up so we can
get the horses back in the corral.

230
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,321
{Sighs} Why did God bring
such a terrible storm on us?

231
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,329
Pa used to say the good Lord and the devil got
credit for things they had nothing to do with.

232
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:38,301
- {Sighs}
- Sometimes things just happen, natural course of events.

233
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,895
Sometimes it's all so confounding'.

234
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,531
That's why we have to have
the faith of a child.

235
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,877
Sure was exciting at Millie's today.

236
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,951
- I guess you could call it that.
- What else would you call it?

237
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,520
Crude and rude behaviour.

238
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,355
Let's get the plank up.

239
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,664
{Horse Whinnies}

240
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,908
- Hello, Rose.
- Hello, Sheriff.

241
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,810
Ma made this for the prisoners.

242
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,850
You can go on in. They're harmless.

243
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,382
Hello there, little lady. And you are?

244
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,017
I'm Rose. I'm Millie's daughter.

245
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,686
Oh. Well...

246
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,862
{Sniffs}
Oh, that smells tasty, Rose.

247
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,663
You know, Mama is mighty mad at you two
for wrecking her place...

248
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,398
but she decided to make that up
for you anyways.

249
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,269
Said it was the Christian thing to do.

250
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,933
Thank you. We're very grateful.

251
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,238
Thank you, Rose.

252
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:00,347
Well, one good thing...
We got our chicken and dumplings.

253
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,012
You boys want some water,
you can call the night deputy.

254
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,057
When you're finished with your food,
slide the plates under the door.

255
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,319
And I'll see you in the morning.

256
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,354
Hey, Sheriff.

257
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,562
What's going to happen to us?

258
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,430
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

259
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,561
If you plead guilty...

260
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,696
you pay the assessed damages plus a fine.

261
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,435
- What are the damages?
- Well, I haven't calculated that yet.

262
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,377
The window's boarded up. I have no idea how
much the new glass and repairs will cost.

263
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,040
Plus a table, chair or two.

264
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,879
Yeah, well, we're pleading not guilty.

265
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,818
Fine. When the judge hits town,
we'll hold a hearing in the jail.

266
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,116
- When the judge hits town?
- Yeah.

267
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,920
Circuit judge. Covers all the counties.
Should be back here in about 30 days.

268
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,291
I isn’t staying
in this jail for a month.

269
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:48,162
- Well, then you'd best plead guilty.
- Well, that isn’t justice.

270
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:52,601
- I-I don't know what that is, but it sure isn’t justice.
- We'll plead guilty.

271
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,729
No, we're not!

272
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,273
Well...

273
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,110
I can see you boys
need some time to talk it over.

274
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,510
Take the night.

275
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,515
This isn’t fair, Clark,
and we're not pleading guilty.

276
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,591
You did throw the first punch.

277
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,592
We got about three dollars between us.

278
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,594
The-That won't even cover a new window.

279
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,927
Well, maybe we can work it off.

280
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,695
Not me, old buddy.
I got bigger and better things to do...

281
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,997
places to go, things to see.

282
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,369
In case you hadn't noticed,
we're in a jail cell.

283
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,602
Well, there isn’t a jail built
I can't bust out of.

284
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,372
Neither one of us has ever been locked up
before. What are you talking about?

285
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,540
You got no imagination, Clark.
You never did.

286
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,310
It's part of your charm, I guess.

287
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,148
Just eat your food and go to bed.

288
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,864
{Snoring}

289
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,012
{Snoring Continues}

290
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,188
{Snoring Continues}

291
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,584
They'll shoot you.

292
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,390
It's not too late. Come with me.

293
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,225
You really think you're going to
get away with this?

294
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,800
Use your head for once,
and let's pay our debt.

295
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,772
We didn't come this far
just so we could sit behind bars.

296
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,537
If we don't get out of here now,
we're never going to make it to California.

297
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,545
- Grow up and be a man.
- Good luck, Clark.

298
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,716
Look me up when you get out west.

299
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,648
If you ever make it that far.

300
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,596
{Murmurs}

301
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,530
{Snoring}

302
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,511
{Sighs Deeply}

303
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,816
{Snoring Continues}

304
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,824
- {Horse Whinnies}
- {Moos}

305
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,897
{Chickens Clucking}

306
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,375
{Horse Knickers}

307
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:57,139
I gathered the eggs.
The hens didn't do so well laying.

308
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,183
Maybe the storm scared 'em.

309
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,979
They'll settle down.

310
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,748
- Do you want some help in the garden?
- That would be great.

311
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,360
You know, if we made the garden bigger,
we could grow more stuff to sell.

312
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,988
We could, after we fix the shingles
on the roof of the house...

313
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,032
and repair the barn door.

314
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,658
And get the new corral posts up.

315
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,896
{Both Chuckle}

316
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,099
We weren't this close
when Pa was alive, were we?

317
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,675
No.

318
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,204
Why do you think that is?

319
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,781
I suppose it's the age difference.

320
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:37,014
And I was caught up in the trifles
that tend to divert a young woman.

321
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,420
You mean Jake?

322
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,389
Yes, Jake.

323
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,765
- Do you miss him?
- I try not to think of it.

324
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,825
It's been over two years,
and you haven't heard a word from him.

325
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,236
- Do you think he's dead?
- I don't know.

326
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,740
Well, if he wasn't dead...

327
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:01,711
he would have written or sent
some kind of word from the goldfields.

328
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,077
We parted on disagreeable terms.

329
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,146
You part that way with a loved one, it...

330
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,153
tends to make any loss more grievous.

331
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,246
Was he your true love?

332
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,588
You need years with someone
to know such a thing.

333
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:19,892
True love is born of experience,
not fairy dust.

334
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,398
Do you think I'll find my true love?

335
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,064
Yes, you will.

336
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,134
But first I need your help
clearing this garden.

337
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,245
{Horse Whinnies}

338
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,354
What have you got to say for yourself?

339
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,685
When I went back to check on 'em,
the cell door was open.

340
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,089
One was gone.
The other one was just sitting' there.

341
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,627
- Excuse me?
- I don't know how it happened.

342
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,631
I'll tell you how it happened. You fell asleep,
and a prisoner escaped using a dinner fork.

343
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,964
I ought to lock you up in his place.

344
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,594
Get out of here.
I'll figure out what to do with you later.

345
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,103
Well, Mr. Clark Davis,
looks like you're on your own.

346
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,543
Appears so.

347
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,013
Mr. Whittaker skipped over to the stable,
broke in...

348
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,550
took his horse and beat it out of town.

349
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,313
Sounds about right.

350
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,048
- Don't suppose you know anything about this.
- I'm here, aren't I?

351
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,989
Yes, you are.

352
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:30,367
- I was sleeping'.
- You and my deputy both.

353
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,563
I woke up,
and Daniel was fooling with the lock.

354
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,503
I tried to talk him out of it.

355
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:39,043
- I suppose you're going after him now?
- Waste of my time.

356
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,840
He'll just end up on the wrong side
of the law someplace else...

357
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,642
if the devil don't get him first.

358
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,716
I will put his name out on the wire though.

359
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,377
We've been friends since childhood.

360
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,183
I'd be careful who I'd call friend.

361
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,985
{Sighs}
I pled guilty. Now what?

362
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,291
The fine for public nuisance is $10.

363
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,196
The repairs at Millie's
will probably be about 30.

364
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,072
I got $1.50.

365
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:21,585
That'll cover about three weeks' board
on your horse over at the stable.

366
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,086
I'll go get you some breakfast
since you'll be staying here.

367
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,054
- Sheriff, wait.
- What is it now?

368
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,955
Isn't there some way I could work it off?

369
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,434
Hyah.

370
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,744
{Chattering}

371
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,789
{Horse Whinnies}

372
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,728
{Horse Blusters}

373
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,723
Millicent, can I have a word with you?

374
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,304
I'd like to run something by you
concerning this young man.

375
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,468
I'm listening.

376
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,134
Sit.

377
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,577
So, what's this all about?
Where's the other one?

378
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:29,211
Slipped out last night
while my deputy was sleeping.

379
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:33,781
Came in this morning, and this one's
just sitting there. The door's wide open.

380
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,656
Now why do you suppose he didn't leave?

381
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:42,461
I believe he is a responsible young man who
would like to do right by you and the town.

382
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,762
In fact, that's what I came
to talk to you about.

383
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,269
I'm still listening'.

384
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,844
{Holden}
Won't be much further now.

385
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,973
{Clark}
Do you mind if I ask where we're going?

386
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,881
Nope.

387
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,315
No, you don't mind, or no, don't ask?

388
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,822
Barlow Farm.

389
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,086
Ellen Barlow lives there
with her sister Cassie.

390
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,128
They've been looking for some hired help.

391
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,790
Can't pay much, but it'll suit your needs
paying off what you owe.

392
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:19,802
- Two women living alone?
- Pa died last winter. Mom died giving birth to Cassie.

393
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,074
And you're trusting me not to run?

394
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,075
You give me your word you'll stay?

395
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,475
You have my word on it.

396
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,810
Your word's good enough for me.

397
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,440
But if you run, I will find you...

398
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,451
and I may have to shoot you.

399
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,668
{Whinnies}

400
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,240
You can make camp up there.

401
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,209
Close to work, out of the ladies' hair.

402
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,279
Plenty of game up there. You'll make do.

403
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,406
Ellen! Cassie!

404
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,087
Ellen, it's Sheriff Holden.

405
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,553
Hello, Sheriff.

406
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:16,024
- Good day to you, Sheriff.
- Ellen.

407
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:19,153
That fellow with the sheriff is the one
that was in the fight at Millie's.

408
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,164
Yes, it seems so.

409
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,734
Sheriff, what can we do for you today?

410
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,827
It's what I can do for you.

411
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,406
Ellen Barlow, Cassie Barlow,
meet Clark Davis.

412
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,407
The solution to your hired hand problem.

413
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:38,280
Sheriff Holden, why don't you step down
so we can talk in private?

414
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,475
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,117
Cassie...

416
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,212
make sure he don't run off.

417
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,086
{Cassie Sighs}

418
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,717
You and those other fellas
sure tore up Millie's place.

419
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,661
Yeah, we sure did.
I'm really sorry about that.

420
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,995
It was a grand fight.
Grandest fight I ever saw.

421
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,695
In fact, the only fight I ever saw.

422
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,828
Rose too. Rose is Millie's daughter.

423
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:04,568
Cassie, hold the horse. Stop talking.

424
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,642
Why'd you bring that criminal here?

425
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,806
- {Holden} He's not a criminal.
- Then what is he?

426
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,578
He's an able-bodied man who will work
for you to pay off Millie and the law.

427
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,745
He started a brawl. He can't be trusted.

428
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,187
First of all, he did not start the brawl.
Millie and you said so.

429
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,554
- That is beside the point.
- No, it is not beside the point.

430
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,993
And secondly, I'm a damn good judge of human
nature, and that boy has a good, solid character.

431
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,497
You have only known him for a day.

432
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,194
The other one broke out of jail and took off.
This one stayed to face the music.

433
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:32,860
That tells me a lot about his character.

434
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,533
We'll find someone else.

435
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,201
Ellen Barlow,
you are as stubborn as your old man.

436
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,939
Besides, there is no one else,
and you sorely need him.

437
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,316
Fine.

438
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,183
But only on a trial basis.
One week at a time.

439
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,452
Minus the $1.50 he already paid,
he owes 38.50.

440
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,550
A month's wages ought to cover that debt.

441
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,061
I told him he could
camp up there on the hill.

442
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,400
- Thank you, Cassie.
- You're welcome, Sheriff.

443
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,025
{Horse Whinnies}

444
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,299
- You leaving?
- Appears so.

445
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,171
Don't you worry. I'll be back
to check on you from time to time.

446
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,905
- Good-bye, Sheriff.
- Stay out of trouble, Cassie.

447
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,708
You too, Sheriff.

448
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,280
- {Clicking Tongue}
- Cassie.

449
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,920
{Horse Whinnies}

450
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,422
Miss Barlow, I just want to tell you
it's a pleasure to meet you...

451
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,424
and, uh, I really appreciate
this job opportunity.

452
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,653
Look, Mr... {Sighs}
What's your name?

453
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,593
It's Davis. Clark Davis.

454
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:36,326
Mr. Davis, I truly do not feel comfortable
having the likes of you around...

455
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:39,835
but we need some hired help,
and you're all there seems to be.

456
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,998
- The likes of me?
- I heard your friend say you were going to the goldfields.

457
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,702
- Is there something' wrong with that?
- Dreamers, chasing' rainbows...

458
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,745
looking' for gold, get rich quick.

459
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,439
Well, there is gold to be found.

460
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,278
Look. If you're going to work here,
you best get started.

461
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:57,286
Half a day's already gone. If I'm going to pay
you a daily wage, I expect a full day's work.

462
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,754
Yes, ma'am. You'll get a full day's work.
Just tell me where to start.

463
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,053
Well, there's plenty that needs attention.

464
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,287
You can start by fixing the barn door.

465
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,000
Okay.

466
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,264
She's not so ornery
once you get to know her.

467
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,398
I might not live long enough
to get to know her then.

468
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:21,308
There's tools and a ladder in the barn,
and the lumber's out back.

469
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:23,812
Come on. I'll show you, Mr. Davis.

470
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:27,146
Just call me Clark. Mr. Davis is my pa.

471
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,578
{Cow Moos}

472
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,486
You best be careful up there.

473
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,151
I will. Thanks for the advice.

474
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,765
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- Well...

475
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,563
guess we're going to find out.

476
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,068
Cassie, would you come here, please?

477
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,835
{Sighs}
Got to go see what she wants.

478
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,643
- {Sighs} Do you need me?
- Of course I need you.

479
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,881
- But I'm helping with the barn door.
- Come on inside the house.

480
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,650
{Sighs}

481
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,832
Did you want to talk about something?

482
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,812
I think it's better if we maintain a
distance from him till we get to know him.

483
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,508
How do we get to know him
if we maintain a distance?

484
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:37,213
We know nothing' about him except he started
a fight, and he got thrown in jail.

485
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,688
Now, please,
just stay away from him for now.

486
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,726
I best get back. He may need my help.

487
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,125
Cassandra Mae, did you hear a word I said?

488
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,221
Every word, Ellen Louise.

489
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,008
{Sighs} You fixed it.

490
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,381
{Exhales} Hope so.

491
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:18,657
Sometimes I have to remind Ellen
that she is my sister and not my mother.

492
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,095
- She's concerned for you.
- I can take care of myself.

493
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:24,032
Oh, yes, ma'am. I'm sure you can.

494
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,235
Heading' to California...
that sounds so very exciting'.

495
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,172
Your sister don't seem to think so.

496
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,766
- That's 'cause of Jake.
- Jake?

497
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,779
Jake Weller. He was Ellen's sweetheart.

498
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:40,817
Moved to California with gold fever
about two years ago.

499
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,910
He wanted her to pack up and go with him,
but she didn't want that.

500
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,389
- Yeah? What happened to him?
- Don't know. Haven't heard a word from him.

501
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,457
Well...

502
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,222
that could prejudice someone
against the pursuit of gold.

503
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,061
Yes, sir, it could.
She has very hard feelings against it too.

504
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:59,933
Yeah, seems so. Hey, would you grab that
two-by-four and slide it right under this door?

505
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,374
Thank you. You're a real big help.

506
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,811
- Really?
- Really.

508
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,042
- {Ellen} All fixed?
- {Grunts}

509
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,050
I believe so.

510
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,722
{Cassie} It stayed up.

511
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,458
So far.

512
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,494
It's working.

513
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,327
Well, it's staying on the hinges.

514
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,128
That's the important part.

515
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,829
Cassie, we need to
take my mending to town and deliver it.

516
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,873
- Go pack the wagon and get ready to go.
- Can't I stay here?

517
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,738
I thought we'd go by Millie's for lunch.
You can catch up with Rose.

518
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,972
- I'm going.
- I'll hitch the team.

519
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,139
Well, looks like you fixed it.

520
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,410
Seems like it.

521
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,349
Can I give you a hand with that team?

522
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,786
No, that won't be necessary.
I can manage on my own.

523
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,154
Okay. What do you have in mind next?

524
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:32,389
Corral. One of the posts has rotted out.
Other three need mending.

525
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:36,024
The new posts are behind the barn, and all
the tools you'll need are inside the barn.

526
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,003
I'll get right on it.

528
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,679
Me and Rose are going

<i>Rose and I.</i>

530
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:55,080
All right. Rose and I are
going to the dry goods store.

531
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,882
And please remember
to see if my gingham material's come in.

532
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,150
You'll be back in time for the supper rush?

533
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,419
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thanks.

534
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,392
I have to admit.
That fight was pretty exciting.

535
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,161
Oh, I don't know.

536
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:15,000
I take it you have a hired hand
working for you now?

537
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,768
Trial basis, one week at a time.

538
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,867
I don't know how I feel
about trusting a man who gets in a fight.

539
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:24,436
Well, the sheriff brought him by here.
Seemed like a pretty solid fella.

540
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,517
We'll see.

541
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,551
And he's not too disagreeable to look at.

542
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,746
{Chuckles} Millie, please.

543
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,223
I hadn't noticed.

544
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,486
Oh, of course you haven't.

Let your good and perfect will
be done in Cassie's life.

00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,296
Let no one stand in your way.

Not even me.

- Good morning.

When you're finished with that post, Mr...
Mr. Davis...

554
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,463
don't forget the other
three that are loose.

555
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,768
I won't forget.

556
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,433
Miss Barlow.

557
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:03,975
Yes?

558
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,675
You know, I never intended on being here.

559
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,048
If I could have repaid that debt,
I would have.

560
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,451
But I gave the sheriff
my word I would see this through.

561
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:14,115
- Your point is?
- Long as I'm here, I'm going to be civil to you.

562
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,125
All I ask is you do the same in return.

563
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,663

He's a real hard worker, isn’t he?

567
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,939
<i>Isn't he.</i>

568
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:41,417
He has motive to be. Once he pays
off his debt, he'll be on his way.

569
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,817
He's not like the other
gold diggers we've met.

570
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,752
{Ellen} They're all the same.

571

After fortune and adventure.

572
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,828
He hums while he works.

573
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,625
Pa was always humming while he was working'.

574
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,833
Does this fella remind you of Pa?

575
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,427
No.

576
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,373

- Oh.

00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:33,128
Ellen's the second-best cook
in the whole county, next to Millie.

581
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,364
Of course, you know
Millie's place real well.

582
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,100
Yeah, I'm afraid I do.

583
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,507
Thank you, Cassie.
This looks really good. I appreciate it.

584
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,909
If you need a drink,
there's a tin hanging from the pump.

You're doing a real dandy job.

587
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,947
Dandy as a dandelion.

588
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,824
- What?
- My pa used to say that all the time.

589
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,661
I've never heard
anyone else say that before.

590
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:07,568
Yeah, I'd heard he had passed on.
I'm really sorry to hear that.

591
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,798
No, it's all right.

592
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,841
It's good to hear it again.

593
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,276
Cassie.
When you're finished, I need you.

594
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,645
She just can't seem to get on without me.

595
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,816
It's good to be needed.

596
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:30,821

- I have to go.

{Whinnies}

598
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:46,298
- Go on inside and put this on.
I took out the hem some. - Why?

599
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,901
'Cause you're getting so tall,
the dress is looking too short.

600
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:52,005
And I always want you to look your best.
Besides, the dance is coming' up.

601
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,674
I forgot about that.

602
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,388
You know, Cassie's right.
You're a real good cook.

603
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,863
Thank you.

I can hear that. There's no law against it.

608
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:38,225
You know, this time of year,
we could get another storm.

609
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,162
If a body was camped outside,
it sure would be miserable.

610
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:45,201
Is that your way of saying we should allow
Mr. Davis to move to shelter?

611
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,793
- Oh, do you think so?
- {Chuckles}

612
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,373
Your concern for his well-being...
it's duly noted.

613
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:55,744
- Is that a no?
- Yes. Now turn around so I can see the back.

614
00:41:55,846 --> 00:42:00,215
- {Sighs} Will you think about it?
- Would you hold still?

615
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,971
You turned out to be quite the farmer.

616
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,273
{Clark Chuckles}

617
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,640
I didn't even hear you ride up.

618
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,645
My grandpa was half Osage.

619
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,682
He'd sneak up on a rabbit,
grab it by the ears with one hand.

620
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,478
- You just riding by?
- Nope.

621
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:38,678
Rode out to check on you,
like I said I would.

622
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,950
You holding up all right?

623
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,720
Uh... {Chuckles}
Yes, sir.

624
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:47,888
Ellen's a tad pushy and a bit headstrong,
but she's a good person.

625
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:51,092
She's guilty on the first two counts,
but I haven't seen the nice part yet.

626
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,793
Few do.

627
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,463
Gal's got a... heavy burden...

628
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,973
what with keeping this place going
and raising Cassie.

629
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,202
Yes, sir. Well...

630
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,279
Well, I'm still here, so you can rest easy.

631
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:07,146
I knew you were a man of your word.
But I never rest easy. You'll be seeing me again.

632
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,446
I'll count on it.

633
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,078
Got an answer back on that wire I sent out
on Daniel Whittaker.

634
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:16,125
Turns out he got himself arrested
for rustling a few counties west of here.

635
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,587
- Are they going to hang him?
- Could be.

636
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:23,690
Funny how life is. If you'd been with him,
you could be facing the noose.

637
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,792
But here you are.

638
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,871

639
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,439
Hyah! Hyah!

640
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,975
Yeah, here I am.

641
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,711
You make the best apple pie
this side of the Mississippi.

642
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,646
<i>What's wrong with my apple pie?</i>

643
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,514
Nothing'.
It just comes second to Millie's.

644
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,953
You are too kind.
So how's your hired hand doing?

645
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:49,457
He allows me to help.
And he treats me like an adult.

646
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,824
Unlike someone else I know.

647
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,988
He seems to be a hard worker.

648
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,032
Ellen's being kind of ornery with him.

649
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,034
He works for us.
We're not meant to be his friend.

650
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,900
Well, you can be kind of ornery
with a lot of folks.

651
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,133
Well, some folks deserve it.

Hello.

00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:27,029
- Morning'.
- Morning'.

657
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,666
You're almost finished with the corral.

658
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,668
Couple more planks, it'll be there.

659
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,330
I'm going to go pick
wildflowers in the meadow.

660
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,066
Maybe one day you can pick some for me.

661
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,142
Sure. Just tell me when.

662
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,270
Miss Barlow, how are you?

663
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,848
Fine.

664
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,923
- You do good work.
- Thank you.

665
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,821
My pa taught me a lot about carpentry.

666
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:57,587
Come in real handy around here.

667
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:03,361
So, you have a trade, yet you decide to
waste your life on trivial pursuits.

668
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:07,028
{Chuckles} I guess you just got me
all figured out, don't you, Miss Barlow?

669
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:11,665
Well, I don't understand how a man
can leave his family and his home...

670
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,606
and travel clear across the country...

671
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,578
in pursuit of a few little rocks,
no matter how much they're worth.

672
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,945
Well, I think some men
are just in pursuit of a better life.

673
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,779
Others want a shortcut.

674
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,445
I was in it for the adventure.

675
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,822
So, what's next?

676
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,629
After you leave here?

677
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,668
Probably keep heading west.

678
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,932
Catch a steamer out of San Francisco.
Head on over to China.

679
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,267
China?

680
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,176
New adventure. New places. New people.

681
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:51,236
Doesn't sound like you have
any plans to settle down anytime soon.

682
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,816
One day I would like to settle down.

683
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,612
Have a family.

684
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,859
## {Humming}

685
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,459
{Chickens Clucking}

686
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:16,061
Chickens have been laying real good
since you got here. Think they like ya.

687
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:19,006
Yeah? Guess that makes me
a regular ol' rooster, huh?

688
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,375
There's a dance in town this Saturday.

689
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:23,969
Never been to a dance.

690
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:28,177
There's plenty of good food,
socializing and music.

691
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,186
- Are you and your sister going'?
- Never miss it.

692
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,654
- Maybe you could go with us?
- You have to ask Ellen that.

693
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,725
{Ellen} Ask Ellen what?

694
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:40,022
Well? I'm waiting'.

695
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,961
Could he go to the dance with us?

696
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,327
Well, if he wants to, all right.

697
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,870
No, that's all right. I, uh...

698
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,735
I don't have any fancy clothes anyway.

699
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:53,537
I think we could find him a suit to wear.

700
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:01,283
## {Folk}

701
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,590
{Chattering}

702
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,926
{Man} Good to see ya again.

703
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,771
Sure hope this suit looks all right.

704
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:26,400
Looks better than all right.
Fits you better than it did Pa.

705
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,944
You look beautiful.

706
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,677
I haven't worn this dress
in over two years.

707
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:37,182
Not since Jake left.

708
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:40,222
Cassie told me about him.

709
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:43,418
She can't keep her mouth shut
to save her soul.

710
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,256
You still look very fetching.

711
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,997
I took it out of the closet just for today.

712
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,726
## {Ends}

713
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,635
Ellen.

714
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,434
Look at you all slicked up.

715
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:00,971
There'll be no trouble here, boys.

716
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:04,479
Ah, we isn’t looking' for any trouble,
Sheriff. Isn’t that right, John?

717
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,208
Nah, just commenting'
on how different he looks.

718
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:07,908
What is it that you boys want?

719
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,747
Just wanted to shake this fella's hand.

720
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:13,914
And to tell him we feel
partially responsible for his trouble.

721
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,424
- Yeah, you mean that?
- My word on it.

722
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,053
Bygones are bygones.

723
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,893
Enjoy the dance.

724
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,467
- ## {Resumes}
- You do look very spiffy.

725
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:34,910
Come on. Let's dance.

726
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,448
John, would you be a dear
and get me a punch?

727
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:39,913
My pleasure. Ellen?

728
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:42,076
No, thanks. I'm fine.

729
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,657
{Chattering}

730
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,126
So, will we be seeing Mr. Davis
at services tomorrow?

731
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:56,029
I mentioned it to him on the way here.
Seems he's not a spiritual man.

732
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:59,102
Oh, my. That's too bad.

733
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,863
Do you find him handsome?

734
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,461
You know I do.

735
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,344
I find him passable at best.

736
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,710
Okay, slightly more than passable.

737
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,514
He's a hard worker. Good craftsman.

738
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,318
Seemingly of pleasant nature.

739
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:25,555
He's got a good spirit.
Just needs a little cultivating'.

740
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,892
And he'll be leaving soon.

741
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,634
- ## {Ends}
- {Chuckles}

742
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:34,431
Thank you for the dance,
kind sir.

743
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,199
My pleasure, madam.

744
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,238
Some fine dancing' out there, Mr. Davis.

745
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,040
You should dance with him, Ellen.

746
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,013
Now, Cassie,
normally the fella asks the gal to dance.

747
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,311
Well, ask her.

748
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,215
May I have this dance?

749
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,255
You may.

750
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:55,917
## {Waltz}

751
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,823
I'm going to go find Rose.

752
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,736
- Oh, they make a fine-looking couple.
- That they do.

753
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,343
Now, Millie...

754
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,140
don't you go playing' Cupid.

755
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:19,147
That boy is set on leaving'.

756
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,213
We'll see.

757
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,016
Cassie's so eager to grow up.

758
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:29,722
I can remember wanting' to grow up.

759
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,225
Have you?

760
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,692
I think so.

761
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,566
I know what I want now.

762
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:43,571
So many of the things that I thought
were the most important in the world...

763
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:46,198
well, they turned out not to be.

764
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,743
I owe you an apology.

765
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,077
I don't think so.

766
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:57,950
When you first came into our lives,
I prejudged you.

767
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,381
But you're not the person
I believed you to be.

768
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,322
You don't have to do that. It's fine.

769
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,088
Let me finish.

770
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:08,995
I feel like... I'm getting to know you.

771
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:13,161
The real you, not my perception of you.

772
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,333
I mean, I like you.

773
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,336
I like you too.

774
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,335
{Knickers}

775
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:03,474
Cassie, you best hurry.
We don't want to be late for service.

776
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:05,054
I'm coming'!

777
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,716
Good morning'.

778
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:11,622
Morning'.

779
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:14,219
Saw the team hitched up.
Figured y'all was heading' off to church.

780
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:17,596
We don't have a church in the usual sense.

781
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,896
Services are held outside
in the common area.

782
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:21,334
I see.

783
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:25,272
Well, I invited you once before,
and... I shall do it again.

784
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,104
Would you care to join us?

785
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,407
I do appreciate the offer, but I think
I'm going to stay here and tend to the garden.

786
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:32,482
We could all use an ounce of faith.

787
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:35,881
Miss Barlow, I'm not even sure
if I know what that word means.

788
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,582
Faith means believing' in something' greater
than oneself. A higher power.

789
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,351
Well, if it's all the same...

790
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,518
I think I'll spend my day doing something
a little more constructive.

791
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:48,029
<i>Worship is constructive, Mr. Davis.</i>

792
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:50,099
It's the most important work of all.

793
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,294
Well, if it's okay with you,
we'll just agree to disagree on that one.

794
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,200
But I do appreciate the offer to the dance.

795
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,739
You're welcome.

796
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,010
Cassandra!

797
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:04,842
Morning', Clark.

798
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:07,382
Cassie, please, in the wagon.

799
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,418
I don't want to be late.

800
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,587
Let me help you up.

801
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:26,766
We always have a potluck after services.

802
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,031
- You'll have to scrounge for your lunch.
- I'll make do.

803
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,039
- {Reins Snap}
- {Whinnies}

804
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,820
## {Humming}

805
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:53,653
- Mr. Davis.
- Miss Barlow.

806
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:57,927
It's the end of the week. Your pay.

807
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:01,094
- Wasn't Miss Millie at the service?
- She was.

808
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:05,766
- You can just give it to her.
- No, it's not my place.

809
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,570
It's better if you do.

810
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,838
All right. Thank you.

811
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:19,414
The garden is looking wonderful.

812
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:21,888
Thank you.
The, uh, tomato's looking' real ripe.

813
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,926
Eggplant's just about ready to be picked.

814
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,927
We can take it into town tomorrow.

815
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,623
I sell most of my crops
at the general store.

816
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:31,565
- You can visit Millie then.
- Sure thing.

817
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,429
You know, I'm just about done here...

818
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:37,165
so I'll probably pack up my stuff
and head back up to camp.

819
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:44,507
- We're just about to sit for Sunday supper.
- Is that an invitation?

820
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:48,846
It's the proper Sunday thing to do,
Mr. Davis.

821
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,852
Well, then I'd be obliged to accept.

822
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,785
Miss Barlow.

823
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,918
Perhaps since you and I are going to share
Sunday supper together...

824
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,020
maybe we can call each other
by our given names.

825
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,259
All right.
{Chuckles}

826
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:07,063
You best wash up before you come inside.

827
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,694
Sure thing, Ellen.

828
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:15,043
{Sighs}

829
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,845
- Cassie, did you pick those flowers?
- For you. Just like you asked.

830
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:26,185
You wouldn't mind if I took 'em tomorrow
when we go into town, would ya?

831
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,086
They're yours to do as you like with them.

832
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:32,092
I find gardening
very relaxing and enjoyable.

833
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,425
Plant some seeds, add some water...

834
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:38,194
a little sunlight,
and life magically springs from the ground.

835
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:41,464
That sounds so very poetic.

836
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,596
I hear what you're saying'.
I feel the same way.

837
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:47,768
We've been wanting' to expand our garden,
grow some more vegetables.

838
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:50,539
I might be able to help with that.

839
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,444
With the boss's permission.

840
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:55,575
I suppose that would be all right.

841
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,051
Probably just need some wildflower seeds,
we'll plant around the garden.

842
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,746
It'll look real nice.

843
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:03,587
- Who wants to say grace?
- I'll say it. It's my turn anyway.

844
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:07,390
Mr. Davis... I mean, Clark,
would that be all right with you?

845
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:09,431
It's perfectly all right.

846
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,973
Lord, thank you for this food
that we are about to receive...

847
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:24,945
and thank you for our new friend Clark.

848
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,948
Please watch over him.

849
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:31,043
Even though he doesn't much believe in you,
he's still a kind and decent man.

850
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,622
Also, please keep watch over Ma and Pa.

851
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,556
Your friend, Cassie Barlow. Amen.

852
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,061
See? That wasn't so hard.

853
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,801
I really appreciate the hospitality.

854
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:52,671
I really enjoyed the meal and the company.
Especially the company.

855
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:55,404
- You're quite welcome.
- Maybe we can do it again.

856
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,241
It was special for Sunday.

857
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:59,110
Maybe again next Sunday?

858
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,445
Maybe.

859
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:05,510
Cassie was thinking' you'd be more comfortable
sleeping' in the barn instead of outside.

860
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:06,816
There's an old cot and everything.

861
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,584
You'd have a roof over your head.

862
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:10,318
Are you sure?

863
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,555
She asked you. Of course she's sure.

864
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,590
Well, I, uh... I better be up early...

865
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,930
get the squash and tomatoes picked
and packed up for town.

866
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:22,561
- I'll help you.
- After your house chores.

867
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,196
After my house chores.

868
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:27,208
- Ladies, thank y'all again.
- You're welcome.

869
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,769
## {Humming}

870
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,617
He's humming' again.

871
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:37,743
Yes, I can hear that.

872
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,689
We should put the dishes up.

873
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:48,564
Are you going to help me,
or am I your slave?

874
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,708
{Horse Whinnying}

875
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,303
{Pigs Squealing}

876
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,076
Go. Go.

877
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,651
Get off.

878
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,838
Well...

879
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,846
beats sleeping' on the ground.

880
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,448
{Clucking, Squawking}

881
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,721
{Chattering}

882
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:02,502
Well, they're a little wilted,
but I hope she likes 'em.

883
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:04,835
All women like flowers, wilted or not.

884
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,535
It's the thought behind them that counts.

885
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,475
So I'll meet y'all back here then?

886
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:12,980
We're going by the dry goods store
and then a few other places.

887
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:16,540
- Will an hour do you?
- That's plenty enough time. See y'all in an hour.

888
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:20,521
Who do you suppose those flowers are for?

889
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:24,320
I don't know.
Some gal, I guess. He said "she."

890
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:28,121
Ellen.

891
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,098
Are you just curious,
or are you a little jealous?

892
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,828
Jealous? Rue the day.

893
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:36,929
Just curious.

894
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,975
Let's go by the dry goods store
and check on that material.

895
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,873
Then we can go by Millie's.

896
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,210
{Woman}
I'm planning it for Tuesday.

897
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,543
Thank you.

898
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,344
{Bell Jingles}

899
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,786
Uh, Ma, you'd best get out here.

900
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:58,422
- {Door Closes}
- {Bell Jingles}

901
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,621
Well, you folks can get back to eaten'.

902
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,630
Rose, you mind the stove?

903
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:10,002
Uh, these are for you.
Sorry. They're a bit wilted.

904
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,367
Nothing' a little fresh water can't fix.

905
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:28,621
You know, I never truly apologized to you.
But I am now.

906
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:32,217
Well, if you feel the need,
then apology accepted.

907
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,361
These are very pretty flowers.

908
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,492
Uh, Cassie... she picked 'em.

909
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:41,695
You and Cassie getting' along all right?

910
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,999
Yes, ma'am. Just fine.

911
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:48,544
Would you like to sit down,
maybe have a piece of pie?

912
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,545
Oh, I... I probably
shouldn't stay too long.

913
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,013
The ladies are waiting' on me.
They're doing' a bit of shopping'.

914
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:55,676
Well, if they're shopping',
it's going to be a while.

915
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:57,252
Come on.

916
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,749
Rose, would you bring me
a piece of apple pie?

917
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,324
Yes, ma'am.

918
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,861
{Clears Throat}
I also brought your payment.

919
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,023
You are a young man of principle.

920
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,259
My father.

921
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:15,360
"Be a man of principle and responsibility."

922
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:17,666
In the old days,
I would've told you to forget it.

923
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,643
I lost a lot of money that way.

924
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:24,839
Now I read the good book, and it tells me
to be a cheerful giver and receiver.

925
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:28,678
So, I will cheerfully receive this money...

926
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,616
and give you a piece of pie.

927
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,814
- That's very kind of you.
- Oh, not really.

928
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:35,823
I figured this is
the only money you've got...

929
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:38,052
and you probably couldn't
afford to pay for the pie.

930
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:41,586
{Clears Throat}

931
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,190
Rosie, would you do me a favour
and go polish the silverware?

932
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,599
Oh, yes, ma'am.

933
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,870
Teenage girls.
Full of curiosity and mischief.

934
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:59,706
{Chattering}

935
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,986
{Clark}
Life can be very confounding, Miss Millie.

936
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,716
Something weighing' on you, Clark?

937
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:14,755
It is an ever-changing adventure we are on.

938
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,559
Sure is a fact.

939
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:20,397
Be diligent. Give life time.

940
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:23,131
- We never do know what's right around the corner.
- {Bell Jingles}

941
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:26,106
- {Chuckling}
- Well, looked who dropped in.

942
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,905
With Clark here, I was wondering
if you two were going to stop by.

943
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,605
Well, if I'd known he was coming here,
we would've come with him.

944
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:34,410
He brought me those flowers over there.

945
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,747
Kind of an apology gift.

946
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:39,677
Well, isn't that sweet?

947
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:41,780
Rose is in the kitchen.

948
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:44,489
Ellen, come sit.

949
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,961
- Yep, and I best be checking' on the team.
- No. Stay. They'll be all right.

950
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:52,296
Well, it's pretty hot outside, so they might
need some water. Thank you for the pie.

951
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,975
Looks like I run him off.

952
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:03,011
He's a very nice young man.

953
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:06,548
Not at all like the ones
who caught that gold fever.

954
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:11,216
- He's responsible.
- It would seem that way.

955
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:15,547
There's a big difference between...

956
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:19,617
just having a crush on somebody
and truly being in love.

957
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,462
I dried out the vegetable seeds
like you said.

958
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,835
All I have to do now is go get
some wildflower seeds from the meadow.

959
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,137
Be careful in that tall grass.
The rattlers are out this time of year.

960
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,710
I will.

961
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:43,115
- The garden is going to be great.
- {Chuckles}

962
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,527
She's very excited about the garden.

963
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:53,857
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

964
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,591
- You ready to plant soon?
- Yeah.

965
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:00,760
Just keep turning the soil for a bit, add
some of that dry manure from the milk cow...

966
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,770
water it for a couple days and plant.

967
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:05,841
- You sure know a lot about everything.
- Just basic things.

968
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,638
- You read a lot?
- Some.

969
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:10,735
Mostly I learned from my pa.

970
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,042
He tried to teach me
to be a well-rounded man.

971
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:16,607
- You close to him?
- Very. My ma too.

972
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:20,746
You know, we had some problems
when I was growing up, but...

973
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,882
nothing we couldn't get through
without him shooting' me.

974
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,619
That would've been awful.

975
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:28,561
Then you wouldn't be here, digging in
the dirt and playing in dry manure.

976
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,468
Your pa laugh a lot?

977
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:35,799
- Yeah.
- Mine too.

978
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:37,668
You miss him.

979
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:40,105
I do. Almost every day.

980
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:43,407
Sometimes I think I hear him laugh.

981
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,148
And I turn around,
expecting him to be there.

982
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,378
- Silly, huh?
- No.

983
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,716
No, it's not silly.

984
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:56,588
Those are memories.
Memories are what our lives end up being.

985
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:59,388
- Your pa teach you that?
- And he learned it from my ma.

986
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,500
We got to hang on to the good ones...

987
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,330
let the bad ones go.

988
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,131
Never let 'em haunt us.

989
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,702
- Shoot.
- King me.

990
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:21,438
Your move.

991
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,350
{Inhales Sharply}

992
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,721
I wouldn't move there if I were you.

993
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,333
I know what you're thinking'.

994
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,463
Do you?

995
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:47,133
Cassie's forming an attachment.

996
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:52,308
Cassie told Rose that Clark Davis
reminds her of her father.

997
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,249
I suspected as much.

998
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,120
He'll be leaving soon.

999
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,678
Moving on to California,
following his dream.

1000
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,782
He's not like all the rest of 'em.

1001
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,958
What? You said so yourself.

1002
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:13,035
Oh. Oh, my.
{Chuckles}

1003
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:17,037
Oh, Millie.
Now don't go jumping' to conclusions.

1004
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,073
You're sweet on him.

1005
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:21,541
No, I'm not sweet on him.

1006
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,204
I don't have the time,
nor the inclination...

1007
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,474
for such luxuries.

1008
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:33,253
He's a good man.

1009
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:35,586
Which will make it
all the more difficult when he leaves.

1010
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:38,057
You've got to think about Cassie.

1011
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,561
She never knew her mother.
She lost her father.

1012
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:44,566
How's she going to handle him leaving?

1013
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,507
Have you seen Cassie?

1014
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:02,675
She told me she was going to pick some flowers
and visit your folks.

1015
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:06,016
Oh. Talking' to them gives her peace.

1016
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,920
Guess we all could use
an ounce of that from time to time.

1017
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,686
She's become really fond of you.

1018
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,920
She's a special young lady.

1019
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,298
Your commitment here will be over soon.

1020
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,962
Reckon it will.

1021
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:25,040
You'll be heading' out west to California?

1022
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:28,871
That's been the plan for a long time.

1023
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:31,242
I don't think it'll set well with Cassie.

1024
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:33,872
I don't think it's going to set well
with me either.

1025
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:36,310
And you?

1026
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,081
What about me?

1027
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,290
My ma always told me that a person
who answers a question with a question...

1028
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:50,263
is just avoiding' the first question.

1029
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:54,097
You must be getting' hungry.
I'll go fix your lunch.

1030
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:04,575
{Grunting}

1031
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:13,016
Do you think the Lord holds a grudge
against Clark for not keeping the Sabbath?

1032
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:15,420
I don't think the Lord holds grudges.

1033
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:18,652
I think that's something
we human beings are inflicted with.

1034
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,772
- Well, how was services?
- They were wonderful.

1035
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:36,208
Millie made bread pudding for the potluck.
It was scrumptious.

1036
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:39,110
She asked about you. Rose did too.

1037
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:42,378
Cassie, go on inside and change
and put some flour on the chicken.

1038
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:44,385
I'll be right in to mash the potatoes.

{Coins Clink}

1040
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:49,552
Payday.

1041
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,726
Everything all right?

1042
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,030
Yes.

1043
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,628
Well, thank you.

- For?
- The money.

1045
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:11,910
You more than earned it.
I wish it could be more.

1046
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:13,982
No, it's fine.

1047
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:17,684
- It's Sunday.
- That it is.

1048
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:21,381
- Will you be joining us for supper?
- Is that an invitation?

1049
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:25,483
Well, remember what your mother said
about answering a question with a question.

1050
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:29,325
{Chuckles}
Yes, I'd love to join you for supper.

1051
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:32,400
Tidy up. I've got chicken to fry.

1052
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,061
- I'll unhitch the team for you.
- {Whinnies}

1053
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:46,046
{Cassie} What happened next?

1054
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:49,174
So there were Daniel and I.
We were creeping right behind these grave robbers...

1055
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:51,879
on this road so dark you couldn't even
see your own two feet.

1056
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:55,047
- Were you scared?
- Little bit.

1057
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:58,126
The old boys, they got thirsty.
So they laid that corpse down on the road...

1058
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:00,593
and they headed off to the creek
to get a quick drink.

1059
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,129
And then what happened?

1060
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,199
Daniel and I, we grabbed
that old poor dead fella...

1061
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,461
and we flung him in the ditch!

1062
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:09,970
And then Daniel gets
down, just like this...

1063
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:12,404
and he stretches out in
that corpse's place.

1064
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:15,068
- No fooling'?
- No fooling'.

1065
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:19,045
The old boys came back, they didn't realize
their corpse was a few inches shorter.

1066
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:22,049
And there was Daniel,
lying back, just like this.

1067
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:26,044
What did Daniel say?

1068
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:27,747
He said...

1069
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:31,724
{Loudly}
"Am I getting' heavy, fellas?"

1070
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:35,292
I was a bit rowdy in my younger days.

1071
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:37,695
I bet you were.

1072
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:50,441
- Hello, Clark.
- Miss Millie.

1073
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:57,611
- Is it that day already?
- Yes, ma'am.

1074
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:02,819
Time just slips by.

1075
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,788
Such a precious thing
we can never get back.

1076
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:10,296
Seems to be going' faster too.
Probably 'cause I been so busy.

1077
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,924
Being happy can cause time to fly too.

1078
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:15,903
Yes, ma'am.

1079
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:17,768
So, won't be long.

1080
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:19,898
Won't be an indentured servant anymore.

1081
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:22,500
{Chuckles} Well, I guess I never thought
about it quite like that.

1082
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:26,342
Suppose you'll be heading west,
following your dream?

1083
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,939
I reckon.

1084
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:31,451
I thought about it a lot as of late.

1085
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:33,145
It's been my plans for a long time.

1086
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:37,424
Plans can change.

1087
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:38,993
Yes, ma'am.

1088
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:52,640
{Horse Whinnies}

1089
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:56,771
Hold up there, Mr. Davis.

1090
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:58,574
Sheriff.

1091
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:02,481
I got some news for you
on, uh, Daniel Whittaker.

1092
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,882
- They hang him?
- Nope.

1093
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,682
Escaped the noose this time.

1094
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:08,484
Got six months on a chain gang.

1095
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:10,319
That's good news.

1096
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:11,757
Could be.

1097
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,351
Or maybe they just
postponed the inevitable.

1098
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:16,397
I'm obliged you told me.

1099
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:19,899
Yep. Good seeing you
at the dance the other night.

1100
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:23,768
- Ellen looked mighty pretty.
- Yes, sir.

1101
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:26,033
- Yes, she did.
- Mm-hmm.

1102
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:29,972
Elbow's acting up.

1103
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:32,411
Big storm brewing'.

1104
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:49,259
Mind that old ladder.
Wouldn't want you to break your neck.

1105
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,299
Very funny, Miss Cassie.

1106
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,208
Good morning, Clark.

1107
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:03,176
- Morning'.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?

1108
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:05,644
That it is. None better.

1109
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:07,272
You fixing' shingles?

1110
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,879
Probably take a few days
to tighten them all down.

1111
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:13,750
- Sheriff's predicting rain.
- {Chuckles} I think his elbow is wrong this time.

1112
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,086
- At least not for a few days.

was right again.

01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,723
Apparently so.

1116
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:52,487
Could've held off a few days
so I could get those shingles fixed.

1117
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,694
Looks like the old roof's
holding up just fine.

- It's your move.
- Will the stock be all right?

1119
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:03,102
Put 'em in the barn
before it even started raining'.

when I first got here.

- Everything I need to fix it is still up on the roof.

- It can wait.
- It's raining' outside.

never hurt nothing'.

01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:25,926
Fright tends to do that to a cow.

1184
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,934
That's no matter.

1185
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:31,532
You're walking' a little stiff.

1186
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,438
{Chuckles}
Feeling' a little stiff.

1187
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:35,805
And sore.

1188
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:39,543
I was so frightened
when you fell last night.

1189
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:42,776
I'm lucky I isn’t crippled. Or worse.

1190
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:46,945
But nothing' happened.
It was a miracle, plain and simple.

1191
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,957
"He is faithful who promised."

1192
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,755
Yeah, well, late last night...

1193
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:55,853
after the storm, when it got quiet...

1194
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,666
I said a prayer.

1195
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,561
I haven't done that in years.

1196
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:05,999
Clark.

1197
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:09,305
You know, I think I might've gotten back
some of that faith I used to have.

1198
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,845
When I was a kid,
Ma and Pa took me to church.

1199
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:15,408
You never told me you used to go to church.

1200
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:17,747
I don't know what happened. I...

1201
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:19,753
I just sort of fell away from church.

1202
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:24,449
Last night...

1203
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:26,823
you kissed me on the forehead.

1204
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:28,691
You called me your love.

1205
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:32,531
I thought you were sleeping'.

1206
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:34,192
Did you mean it?

1207
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:37,863
Yes. I meant it.

1208
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:39,964
And I mean it now.

1209
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:44,539
{Cow Mooing}

1210
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:48,978
Thanks for breaking the mood, Sarah.

1211
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:54,981
{Both Chuckle}

1212
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,557
All right.

1213
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:02,892
{Man}
I can't wait. I'll be right over.

1214
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,099
So you're really not going to California?

1215
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:12,367
I've been thinking on it. You know,
like Millie said, sometimes plans change.

1216
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,307
Something special changing those plans?

1217
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:20,246
Whoa. Whoa!

1218
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:22,248
- John, good to see you.
- All right.

1219
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:24,648
- Go ahead and get out, folks.
- Good to see you too.

1220
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,243
- How you doing'?
- All right.

1221
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:28,686
- Burt.
- Sir.

1222
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:31,054
How you doing', sir?

1223
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:34,427
- {Woman} Don't you think?
- Oh, I definitely agree.

1224
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,292
Oh, my gosh.

1225
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:37,865
What's wrong?

1226
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:40,491
{Man}
Just need to get your signature right here.

1227
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:42,069
That's him.

1228
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,234
Who?

1229
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:51,437
Jake Weller.

1230
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:02,218
What are you going to do?

1231
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:04,952
I guess I should go talk to him.

1232
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:08,427
- What will you say?
- I don't know.

1233
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:12,026
Clark, I...

1234
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:15,864
No, no. It's, uh... You do what you must.

1235
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:17,871
It's fine.

1236
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:32,447
Hello, Jake.

1237
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:38,091
Hello, Ellen.

1238
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:39,626
You're alive.

1239
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,591
Why would I be anything else?

1240
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:45,257
I never expected to see you again.

1241
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:48,302
Well, I told you I would come back.

1242
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:50,963
That was over two years ago.

1243
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:53,040
And not a word from you since.

1244
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:56,442
I thought you were dead.

1245
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:13,626
It's so good to see you.

1246
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:18,525
Cassie, why don't you wait on Ellen.
I'm going to ride back.

1247
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:24,471
{Man} I'll take you all the way
to St. Louis. Yes, ma'am.

1248
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:26,506
Don't you want to see what happens?

1249
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:32,938
That isn’t nothing' I need to see.

1250
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:41,882
Hey, is Millie still in business?

1251
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,389
Um...

1252
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:48,489
Yes.

1253
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:50,496
Okay. Well, let's go there,
have something to eat.

1254
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,190
We can catch up on lost time.

1255
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,063
All right.

1256
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:56,137
We can catch up on things.

1257
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:02,633
- {Man} You need some help?
- {Man #2} No, we're good.

1258
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:03,904
{Man #1} All right.

1259
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:06,242
{Jake Chuckles}

1260
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:08,748
I hit the big one.

1261
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:11,216
Enough gold to buy a small country.

1262
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:15,653
Bought a big, beautiful house
in San Francisco, up on a hill.

1263
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:19,986
You can watch the Pacific Ocean all day.

1264
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,996
I'm real happy for you, Jake.

1265
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:25,191
Oh, you're going to love it there.

1266
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:30,059
I... can't imagine living' in San Francisco.

1267
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:32,196
{Jake Chuckles}

1268
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:35,208
Well, neither could I, but...

1269
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,777
look at me.

1270
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:40,575
You seem very happy and sure of yourself.

1271
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:43,310
Yeah, well, now I'm back, Ellie.

1272
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:46,046
A rich man, just like I promised.

1273
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:49,749
And I'm sitting' across a table from you...
{Sighs}

1274
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,758
Asking you to marry me.

1275
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,021
Are you proposing'?

1276
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:55,596
{Chuckles}

1277
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,062
Yes.

1278
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,233
Yes, I am, Ellen Barlow.

1279
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,097
Will you marry me?

1280
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,567
Clark?

1281
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,974
I'm so sorry.

1282
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,737
Me too.

1283
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:45,980
I'm going to go back up to the hill camp.

1284
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,242
I'll finish my commitment up there.

1285
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:54,681
I know you must be feeling
confused and hurt.

1286
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:57,849
Could be. I'll be all right.

1287
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:06,991
Millie once told me there's a difference
between a crush and true love.

1288
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:09,936
And I understand now what she meant.

1289
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:15,138
You told me about
bad memories that can haunt.

1290
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:19,710
There's only room in my life for one man.

1291
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:23,513
And he's the man I want to marry.

1292
01:25:24,752 --> 01:25:26,652
And that man is Clark Davis.

1293
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:40,230
Are you sure?

1294
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:44,237
I've never been more sure
about anything in my entire life.

1295
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:53,744
Nothing' I thought I wanted matters anymore.

1296
01:25:57,585 --> 01:25:59,052
Only you.

1297
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,056
Will you marry me?

1298
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:17,130
<i>{Man}
I now pronounce you man and wife.</i>

1299
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,204
Son, you may kiss your bride.

1300
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:23,470
- {Woman} Aw.
- {Crowd Murmuring}

1301
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,589
<i>{Ellen Narrating} Clark Davis
never did make it to California.</i>

1302
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,683
<i>He never made his fortune in gold...</i>

1303
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:42,058
<i>nor saw the Great Wall of China.</i>

1304
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:45,860
<i>Instead he found his way
to the Barlow Farm...</i>

1305
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:48,936
<i>and into our lives and hearts.</i>

1306
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:52,939
<i>"For where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also. "</i>
