1
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:31,416
"The Catbird Seat"

2
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,725
Quiet.

3
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:13,432
I notice too, stupid, we're each of us breathing in and out.

4
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:32,530
It's Bullock, Star, Utter, and Trixie. And Harry Manning's outside on a sorrel.

5
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,410
What's the whore doing with ‘em?

6
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,814
I don't know. They ain't fuckin' her.

7
00:02:39,564 --> 00:02:44,231
What the fuck is afoot in that hardware store?

8
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:49,356
Facing the dawn united, we're even odds for disaster, let alone in fuckin' factions.

9
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:57,075
Knowing him for an arrant maniac, I'll still not believe Bullock doubts me.

10
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:03,696
“Certain dangers meet to be faced only by the decent and decorous”

11
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:09,123
—or idiocy of that fuckin' ilk—is what must have captured his thinking, this fuckin' jerk.

12
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:13,435
I'm going over there. 
I am going the fuck over.

13
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,054
Let them fucking try to exclude me, huh?

14
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:25,258
You know, saying I like you hefty don't mean you couldn't stand losing a couple of fuckin' pounds.

15
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:39,705
Whatever you'd have me scrutinize must wait until certain cocksuckers have received a piece of my mind.

16
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:41,742
Of whom do you speak? 
Why are you walking backwards?

17
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:46,547
The ink's not yet dry, and I'd have your immediate attention to the article at the top right corner. Stop fuckin' moving then.

18
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:46,875
Oh, thank you.

19
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,359
How's the fuckin' ribs? 
Very painful.

20
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:55,100
Yeah, right there.

21
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:14,545
No rooms to let.

22
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:17,358
Only taking the air.

23
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:21,893
Well, go away.  I'm at prayer.

24
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:30,718
If that's not a lie as I situate on the common, what claim has you piety on my deference?

25
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:36,882
Fuck yourself!

26
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:39,034
Fuck you, Sir!

27
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,453
Who'd prevent expedition of one's life's disarray.

28
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:52,356
Telegram from Mr. Swearengen.

29
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:55,824
A superfluous trumpeting, Mr. Blazanov, as we three are alone.

30
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:59,985
Do I accomplish my purpose, Al, as to the shooting at Mrs. Ellsworth?

31
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:06,189
Short of accusation, do I waft the odor of complicity at Hearst's direction… Give me the telegram.

32
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:12,788
To settle not only upon his clothing, but as it were, on the man himself, in the very fabric of his being.

33
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:14,269
This is bullshit!

34
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:16,535
I'm sorry.

35
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,626
“23 men hired, all on our way.”

36
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:26,876
This squaw-fuckin' idiot—proves in eight words he's incompetent and a fuckin' liar.

37
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:29,688
He can't have Adams' telegram more than four hours ago,

38
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:36,376
yet he expects me to believe that in four hourshe can prudently assess the qualities of 23 hires.

39
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,273
And you know what “on our way” means, huh?

40
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,454
No.

41
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:45,726
“On our way” means they're getting drunk and blown in some saloon in Cheyenne 

42
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:47,617
and running their mouths about this big 

43
00:05:48,249 --> 00:05:52,821
fuckin' filibustering expedition they're being commissioned for under the command of the famous Hawkeye

44
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,367
—the laziest, most shit-faced whore-mongering cocksucker to ever piss my money away!

45
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,915
Please do not strike me.

46
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:03,808
Have you finished the article, Al?

47
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:14,256
That I have not wiped his expectoration from my cheek is understandable.

48
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,948
I'm threatened with death if I do.

49
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:27,715
That I stand immobile these hours later speaks of a flaw in my will.

50
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,788
Surely this is not the culminating indignity.

51
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:42,239
There remains, for example, receiving his regurgitations or swallowing his feces!

52
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:47,916
Would I stand stoic…still?

53
00:06:52,102 --> 00:06:54,664
I am going to fuck you up.

54
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:59,193
I'm going to fuck you up.

55
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:04,647
And I'm the kind of cunt you'll let close.

56
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:12,520
Quit it, Richardson.

57
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:14,943
Is it all right then, the article?

58
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:18,286
Perfect.  Fuckin' wafts just the way you want it to.

59
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:19,769
I'll go ahead and publish then.

60
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:22,349
I gotta get to the fuckin' hardware store!

61
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:41,906
Jack. 
Young man? 

62
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:45,146
At the soul's dark hour?

63
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:47,847
Name one that fuckin' ain't.

64
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:50,813
Mr. Langrishe. 
Yes.

65
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,486
We're going in there, E.B. 
Shall I join you,

66
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:02,118
as we all seem up and about?

67
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:04,300
Excuse me…

68
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:06,746
Gentlemen.

69
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:12,712
Waiting for the Sheriff.  We campaign in Sturgis.

70
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:26,778
A meeting, I gather, of the upper fucking crust exclusively.

71
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:28,641
No hoi polloi need apply.

72
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,048
I ought to have called you.

73
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:34,426
What events in the camp would argue I be called back from Sturgis is what we are trying to decide.

74
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:36,214
It's not a meeting at all, per se.

75
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:38,546
Now I don't feel so horribly injured.

76
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:43,058
The meeting per se is what he'll not be kept from.

77
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:45,436
Jack Langrishe. He's all right.

78
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,311
You showed perfect judgment, Sir.

79
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:54,170
I'd keep from the camp that your janissaries have arrived.

80
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,935
We'll quarter at your find.

81
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,581
Will you drink? 
No, thanks you.

82
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:00,040
I will.

83
00:09:09,188 --> 00:09:11,844
Shall we leave it being generally vigilant?

84
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:15,909
Under very specific circumstances we'll wire you to make early return.

85
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:19,016
Yes. That's exactly it.

86
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,076
And those would be?

87
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:33,793
Any further shooting out of the ordinary.

88
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:35,596
Like at Mrs. Ellsworth, definitely.

89
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,862
Hearst-initiated horseshit of any sort.

90
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:39,436
Intimidation or the like.

91
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:42,700
If it looks to eventuate in immediate violence.

92
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:51,090
Otherwise why try even to make it to Sturgis for the speeches?

93
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,903
Hearst-initiated bullshit is inevitable is his point.

94
00:09:55,935 --> 00:10:04,217
Surely, Sir, you leave in the certain knowledge that you are the camp's irreplaceable man.

95
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,295
He don't need no further encouragement in that way of thinking.

96
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:12,421
Comes to sending a wire, I put that Russian ill at ease.

97
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:15,096
Oh, I do all right with him.

98
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:20,260
My meetings—I provide refreshments.

99
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,043
You were shown the tent of the man I want killed first.

100
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,373
Looked fine, how he wants to work it.

101
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:07,175
I'm leaving.

102
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:08,963
Come in.

103
00:11:09,244 --> 00:11:10,961
It's too much. He's too cruel.

104
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:12,258
Come in.

105
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:20,909
Brazenly sends the other packing, to brazenly install her replacement in the theater.

106
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,433
How was he brazen with the one who left?

107
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:27,404
No one with eyes could fail to recognize their connection.  

108
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:32,121
And now brazenly— 
Us recognizing his connection to the one who left 

109
00:11:32,681 --> 00:11:35,677
does not mean he was brazen. 
Fine.

110
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,725
Fine then. I just came to say goodbye.

111
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:48,786
Must I agree he is brazen for you to not leave the troupe?

112
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:54,057
He has no respect for art.

113
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:56,429
Claudia.

114
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:00,120
He hates me.

115
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:03,008
No.

116
00:12:06,964 --> 00:12:09,216
I was well-received in Denver.

117
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:12,051
Yeah, very well received.

118
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:17,425
I could have stayed. 
I could have let you all go on.

119
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:22,175
I think you were approached by Millerick.

120
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,541
I was.

121
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:33,507
Go to sleep, Claudia. No coaches now anyhow.

122
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:44,937
Did he suspect Millerick approached me?

123
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,044
He doesn't miss much.

124
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:51,606
He misses everything.

125
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,843
I juggled at amateur night.

126
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:15,883
And what are you doing now?

127
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:18,204
Praying for my loved ones.

128
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,404
How nice. Lucky them.

129
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:35,725
Would my conversating with her or lingering after supper have disrupted the little one's routine

130
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:39,270
on a day that had been disrupted previous?

131
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:47,099
Yes. Already she'd seen a series of people taking up watch to protect that schoolhouse,

132
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:50,120
and how many questions must have occurred to her

133
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:57,348
—because that is a bright child—“What is transpiring that we need guarding from?”

134
00:13:58,184 --> 00:14:04,122
And what memories must that have brought back of her own dear family murdered

135
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:10,222
in a sudden fake Indian depredation by shit-heel fuckin' road agents.

136
00:14:13,881 --> 00:14:19,502
Not solely how would I like to be passing the evening, the like.

137
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:29,785
When I've left, have I given the mother more calming down to do before she gets the child asleep?

138
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,438
Them's the sort of things is what you have to consider.

139
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:07,126
Fuck, must you hover, fucking Merrick?

140
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,094
I admit to wondering, Al, if you have any further impression of my article.

141
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,242
Didn't I tell you how well it wafted?

142
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:16,405
If on second reading— 
Merrick, it's a good article.

143
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:22,111
It'll no doubt irritate him, fucking Hearst, but I'm wakeful wondering who he's likely to shoot at next,

144
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,483
so with regard to that I've gave your article all the thought I need to.

145
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:28,522
Who do you think he might shoot at?

146
00:15:31,157 --> 00:15:32,771
I have no fucking idea, Merrick.

147
00:15:33,196 --> 00:15:38,291
I doubt it'll be long before we find out, and in the fucking interval until we do,

148
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:42,647
I guess I'll just have to abandon any prospect of finding respite in 

149
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:45,903
any part of your rag I could just fucking read 

150
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,527
without having to evaluate how it fucking wafts!

151
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:52,134
Oh, which leaves me the solace 

152
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,759
of contemplating the journeying hither of the intrepid fucking Hawkeye and his 23 fucking reprobates

153
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:00,540
to even the odds in the coming combat.

154
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:02,756
Didn't tell you that, did I, Adams?

155
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:05,459
Hawkeye's wire to announce he's on his way.

156
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:13,133
Does that sound likely to you or does it confirm our deepest doubts about his incompetence and veracity?

157
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,381
And mine, in turn, about you that I allowed to fucking vouch for him!

158
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,957
Couldn't let him read his fucking paper.

159
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:46,069
26…27…28.  Uh, not counting them soldiers or Yankton's commissioner.

160
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:53,618
I won't be lingering once we've finished. If you want to stay and politic, 

161
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:55,501
you'll have to ride back alone.

162
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:58,532
I hate what happened in your home.

163
00:16:58,836 --> 00:17:00,352
It's all right.

164
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:05,226
Your wife good enough to ask me in for breakfast.

165
00:17:05,478 --> 00:17:06,500
I'm working on my presentation.

166
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:11,966
That lovely woman putting her hand behind her for support when I feared she might fall to the floor.

167
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:13,165
Would you shut up about it?

168
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:19,651
And then, even if only briefly, to have failed to acknowledge it had been my wind, I'd—

169
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:36,899
What's your purpose here?

170
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:40,350
What do you mean? 
There's no Sioux around here.

171
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:43,849
Shall I go find some, ask ‘em to join us?

172
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,842
I'm saying there's no Fort and there's no Sioux.

173
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,942
Why would they have you bivouacked?

174
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,740
Seems like you got me confused for a general.

175
00:17:55,938 --> 00:18:00,676
Don't be grazing by the windows. Come in and listen or stay the fuck out of sight.

176
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:04,266
I guess you got yourself mistaken for a general.

177
00:18:04,577 --> 00:18:06,253
He wants to know what we're here for.

178
00:18:07,223 --> 00:18:10,831
We're here for the election, maybe gonna exercise the franchise.

179
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:17,594
Time for us to speak now, Sheriff.

180
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:19,678
Have they told you yet who you're voting for?

181
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,219
Not yet.

182
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:25,500
Sheriff, we— 
Shut up, Harry.

183
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,572
Mr. Utter! Mr.—

184
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:23,576
The key got stuck.

185
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:34,712
Ready for fucking Freddie? Hearst let his dogs loose.

186
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:38,038
Davey, get to the Russian.  Tell him to wire Sturgis.

187
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:40,508
Say to wire Bullock as agreed, huh?

188
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:44,444
I want my child.

189
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,651
I'll—I'll go get her now.

190
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:48,270
Mr. Ellsworth—Mr. Ellsworth's been shot.  

191
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:51,398
Mr. Ellsworth's been killed. 
I want my child!

192
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:54,833
She'll be here with you before you know it, Mrs. Ellsworth.

193
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:56,241
Oh, what did I do to him?

194
00:19:57,034 --> 00:19:58,737
We'll go upstairs, get you a drink.

195
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:01,331
What did I do to that poor man?

196
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:03,236
You didn't fucking shoot him.

197
00:20:03,646 --> 00:20:06,314
And don't be going off into fucking hysterics, huh?

198
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:15,589
Collect your child. Utter will be back with her here any minute. Come on.

199
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:22,371
I'm going to make her breakfast.

200
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,197
Pinchbeck motherfucker.

201
00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:08,072
My goodness!  Bare-breasted.  My word.

202
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:11,150
Who has commissioned such behavior?

203
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,806
Who summons you with such power to do his will?

204
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:22,951
Mr. Hearst?  Mr. Hearst?

205
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:39,709
Did someone interrupt your rendez-vous?

206
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:42,035
Did someone else attack him?  

207
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:45,327
Cover those things.

208
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:07,316
Give me your fucking poot-butt gun.

209
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:09,939
Why? 
Fucking shoot me with it if you don't.

210
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:11,235
What's going on, Trixie?

211
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:15,754
Ellsworth's murdered, and I fucking shot Hearst, and I don't think I killed him!

212
00:22:16,474 --> 00:22:18,657
Shoot me or he'll do for all of us.

213
00:22:20,704 --> 00:22:22,549
Shoot me!  Shoot me!

214
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:25,948
Don't you fucking take me anywhere! 
Shut up!

215
00:22:29,532 --> 00:22:30,824
Stand the fuck up!

216
00:22:33,555 --> 00:22:37,970
I piss hard-stole money away to gussy you fucking cunts up.

217
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:41,102
Starchy bullshit.

218
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:48,313
And fucking pretend there's a difference between fat ass snatch and fat ass snatch in a fucking petticoat!

219
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:49,447
Come on, Mr. T.

220
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,414
Where are we going, you rummy-faced piece of shit?!

221
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,184
I'm just saying—

222
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,400
Just saying what? What were you just saying?

223
00:22:57,601 --> 00:22:58,665
I don't know, Sir.

224
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:02,727
Weren't you being this fat twat's gallant?

225
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,888
Ain't Con the nuts, fatso? 

226
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:13,361
Ain't it great to have a fucking beau?

227
00:23:18,723 --> 00:23:19,531
I'm Seth Bullock. 

228
00:23:21,562 --> 00:23:25,068
In Montana, I had a hardware bidness with my partner Sol Star,

229
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:29,281
and we do the same in Deadwood, which we came to in '76.

230
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:34,998
I was Marshal and territorial delegate in Montana,

231
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:38,843
and I'm Health Commissioner and Sheriff where we are now.

232
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:45,457
With the hills now part of the new territory, I run for Sheriff of the new organized county.

233
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:52,110
If elected, my intention's to look to the good and safety of people hereabouts.

234
00:23:52,342 --> 00:23:59,969
I will venture my life that law-abiding persons will be secure in their rights and their property.

235
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,404
I have to go.

236
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:43,966
What is it, Bullock? What happened?

237
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,767
Don't you know? Have they just got you handling the votes?

238
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:51,740
The voting exclusively.

239
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:58,277
He's dead. Dead! And at my hands! Or the next thing to it.

240
00:24:58,552 --> 00:25:00,504
Who? 
Hearst!

241
00:25:00,504 --> 00:25:02,151
He's dead? 
I think.

242
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:03,194
Boss!

243
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:04,834
Excuse me.

244
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:10,676
The gimp's making breakfast for you, if you ain't ate yet.  Jewel.

245
00:25:11,488 --> 00:25:12,276
Well, where was he hit?

246
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:13,646
I don't know. Trixie shot him.

247
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:14,333
Boss!

248
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:15,863
Trixie said she killed him?

249
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:17,446
E.B. said Trixie killed Hearst!

250
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:21,197
You saw him dead?

251
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:22,020
No.

252
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,990
How bad was he hurt?

253
00:25:25,227 --> 00:25:26,128
I'm not sure.

254
00:25:26,487 --> 00:25:28,274
Well, how bad did Trixie say he was hurt?

255
00:25:28,274 --> 00:25:30,599
If he wasn't hurt, wouldn't I have seen him pursue her?

256
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,503
What you mean is she might not have fucking shot him at all!

257
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:36,977
Four steps removed no fucking closer.

258
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:43,291
Boss.

259
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:47,316
Or w-wouldn't he have?

260
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:48,864
Wouldn't he have what?

261
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:50,174
Shut up, E.B.

262
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:02,572
I'm a dead man.

263
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,783
You ain't gonna be alone.

264
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:15,936
I've made this fucking walk before.

265
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:16,996
All right.

266
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,280
Stay here till I get him.

267
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:26,643
Then you get out! Get out with your hovering and fucking clucking!

268
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:33,719
Before hell breaks fucking loose.

269
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,433
Trixie's here, in back.

270
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:46,668
Your idea, her coming here?

271
00:26:47,387 --> 00:26:50,529
My fucking idea, after she did what she did.

272
00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:52,589
Was it your idea to have her do that?

273
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,013
All right.

274
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:06,877
Loopy fucking cunt.

275
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:18,935
Mother's upstairs.

276
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:22,903
Get out of the fucking way, Jewel.

277
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,968
Here, let me take it up.

278
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:26,059
No, you fucking won't.

279
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:34,576
Oh for Christ's sake.

280
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,090
Mr. Utter's come with the child.

281
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:11,979
Getting another plate.

282
00:28:23,872 --> 00:28:27,414
Mr. Utter said only that Sofia's mother had requested her at the Gem.

283
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:29,868
Rely that something fucked has transpired…

284
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:36,135
With Mose God knows where, and me likely needed in camp.

285
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:39,383
Uh, go ahead, Jane. 
I'll stay with Mrs. Bullock.

286
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:45,121
Trouble jumps off, ring the bell. That'll bring me fucking running.

287
00:28:44,904 --> 00:28:45,702
All right.

288
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,925
Or I guess maybe I'll just stay instead.

289
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:04,466
I suppose there's some connection between his condition and yours.

290
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:08,516
That bare-breasted woman who shot me seemed to think there ought to be.

291
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:15,548
Shit! Go ahead, knowing I'd appreciate less enthusiasm.

292
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:21,340
Through the years, that fellow's path and mine crossed several times.

293
00:29:21,918 --> 00:29:28,466
I never meant him a moment's harm, but the natural operation of my holdings

294
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:34,370
and his bad luck brought me to figure in his imagination as some sort of bogey.

295
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:46,339
I expect my attacker was a bawd connected somehow to the man in back before he married so luckily.

296
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:53,089
Likely, she fell victim as he did to imagining me responsible for the change in her situation.

297
00:29:53,838 --> 00:29:55,573
God damn it!

298
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:00,494
Often, because our interests are extensive, people like me are believed the...

299
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,498
authors of events which may benefit our holdings,

300
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:11,123
when our connection in fact is incidental.

301
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:12,524
God damn it!

302
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:29,892
I have some calls to make. Will your gunmen let me pass?

303
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:31,848
Of course.

304
00:30:33,293 --> 00:30:35,730
Don't you want to dress the wound?

305
00:30:51,122 --> 00:30:58,529
My name is Joseanne. Mr. Langrishe was so generous to say he would install me today in the theater.

306
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:00,465
Sit down, dear.

307
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:04,750
Oh! We are waiting for him.

308
00:31:05,293 --> 00:31:06,895
One of our chief occupations.

309
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,217
Mr. Farnum!

310
00:31:23,387 --> 00:31:25,129
Ah, good day, Sir.

311
00:31:26,786 --> 00:31:29,670
Mr. Farnum, a little while ago 

312
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:34,218
I heard what I took for a gunshot

313
00:31:35,378 --> 00:31:38,922
—and impression, I remark, not on the grounds of its uniqueness,

314
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:44,935
but for the shot having seemed to issue from so near to my recumbent ear…

315
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:46,386
You are not mistaken, Sir.

316
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:48,709
The hallway, that is to say,

317
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:59,362
separated from where I rested only by a wall whose thinness you've no doubt had others before me deplore.

318
00:32:01,442 --> 00:32:04,289
The walls do thicken in our west wing.

319
00:32:05,648 --> 00:32:08,083
I'll have a quick look for vacancies.

320
00:32:10,377 --> 00:32:13,911
Hearst shot, the wound, alas, not mortal.

321
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,581
“No help,” as we say at the tables.

322
00:32:24,135 --> 00:32:29,925
Booth…never went you better. Anon anon, Sir.  Anon anon.

323
00:32:38,613 --> 00:32:40,752
God damn it, Richardson.

324
00:32:41,229 --> 00:32:44,142
You're too ugly to be sneaking up on fucking people.

325
00:32:44,392 --> 00:32:45,771
From Mrs. Marchbanks.

326
00:32:45,988 --> 00:32:47,985
We got all the fucking food we need.

327
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,770
Who the fuck is Mrs. Marchbanks anyway?

328
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,080
It's Aunt Lou.

329
00:32:58,094 --> 00:33:02,797
I guess I'd know her for Mrs. Marchbanks if she took time to introduce herself.

330
00:33:03,844 --> 00:33:05,891
Tell the arrogant nigger thanks.

331
00:33:06,377 --> 00:33:08,519
No hurry returning the basket.

332
00:33:09,144 --> 00:33:11,975
Tell her my fucking name's Miss Caulfield…

333
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:16,073
I think.

334
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:21,541
The terms come clear.

335
00:33:22,012 --> 00:33:26,652
If she'd keep her property here, she'll leave,

336
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:34,572
having first hired as many as Hearst has, and who can kill as well as his do and ain't disadvantaged too, to keep Hearst from...

337
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:40,759
killing her, which—by the shots yesterday and Ellsworth butchered today—

338
00:33:41,156 --> 00:33:44,968
means her to understand Hearst will not cease endeavoring to do.

339
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:56,994
But if she'd herself stay in camp, she must sell her property to him.

340
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,695
A very pithy rendering.

341
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:10,915
I want to feel his beard.

342
00:34:13,522 --> 00:34:17,788
Mr. Ellsworth's with God now, Sofia.

343
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:24,243
I want to feel his beard so I can pray that he's saying goodbye to me.

344
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:39,015
Duck duck duck duck duck. Goose!

345
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:42,479
Go, James, go! Go, James, go! Go, James, go! Go, James!

346
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:52,592
Aww! Outflanked by a boy half my size. Next time I'll get you, James.

347
00:35:07,388 --> 00:35:10,178
Ellsworth's murdered, head-shot at the Garret find.

348
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,808
Your partner's sweetheart put one in Hearst's shoulder.

349
00:35:12,808 --> 00:35:13,849
Where's Mrs. Ellsworth?

350
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:16,749
Above with the child. With the child.

351
00:35:17,456 --> 00:35:18,611
I fucking heard ya.

352
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:24,733
He once had something to do with her.

353
00:35:27,421 --> 00:35:32,200
Reason for his making the case she sell, keep her here for another swing.

354
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:35,423
Reason ain't his long suit.

355
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,452
Bullet, removed uneventfully.

356
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,916
Let's pray he avoids infection.

357
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,764
What did Hearst say of the shooting?

358
00:36:28,983 --> 00:36:34,838
That some bawd still connected to Ellsworth musta blamed him for the murder.

359
00:36:35,072 --> 00:36:37,685
Wrong-headed and fallen in the bargain.

360
00:36:40,702 --> 00:36:43,057
Would you find pretext to let the mother know I'm here?

361
00:36:42,984 --> 00:36:46,527
Bullock's with her. 
Shall I shout out and ask it of him?

362
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,604
Very much in your line, this type thing?

363
00:37:00,228 --> 00:37:01,182
Yes.

364
00:37:01,692 --> 00:37:03,253
Not to my taste at all. 

365
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,251
Time's past, one's fled.

366
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:14,894
Doc's here.  Someone fell.

367
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:24,971
Will you excuse me for a moment, Darling?

368
00:37:36,364 --> 00:37:38,533
I want to see Mr. Ellsworth.

369
00:37:42,782 --> 00:37:43,891
Excuse me.

370
00:38:09,845 --> 00:38:16,437
Are you certain that she saw her family dead?

371
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,415
Yes.  

372
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,429
I certainly assume she did.

373
00:38:25,612 --> 00:38:32,290
The man I once was, Al, was not formidable, and I am but his shadow now.

374
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:36,289
And yet I'd be put to use.

375
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:42,071
A decoy, perhaps. A weight to drop on villains from above.

376
00:38:44,762 --> 00:38:46,498
As I heard the account, 

377
00:38:47,522 --> 00:38:56,188
the child was found inside a hollowed-out tree trunk some distance from the others.

378
00:38:57,203 --> 00:39:04,860
Having crawled from the carnage and hidden herself, I'd always assumed.

379
00:39:05,528 --> 00:39:15,234
See, I suppose, rather than Sofia crawling unseen from the carnage,

380
00:39:15,575 --> 00:39:20,401
the possibility might exist that the family hid her in the tree trunk

381
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:25,886
and then fled that distance before the murderers fell upon them.

382
00:39:27,315 --> 00:39:33,011
For the child to have been found having been savaged by wolves,

383
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:50,542
those hours later by strangers, and then taken away having never seen her family again, living or dead…

384
00:40:12,073 --> 00:40:13,179
I can fix that. 

385
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:16,510
Slainte.

386
00:40:33,915 --> 00:40:38,006
Thought you was near pitching a tent and setting up housekeeping over on that first step.

387
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:43,053
You sound like a pig my cousin run off with.

388
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:48,745
Get another?

389
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:09,540
If that cocksucker hadn't shareholders, you could murder him while you adjusted his back.

390
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:15,308
Serpent's teeth—shareholders.  10,000 would rise to replace him.

391
00:41:38,647 --> 00:41:42,138
All right, darling. All right.

392
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,964
Monitor my thinking, Jack.

393
00:42:06,254 --> 00:42:08,151
Oh, no warrant as to competence.

394
00:42:08,404 --> 00:42:10,818
Had Hearst wanted this woman killed, she'd be dead already.

395
00:42:10,818 --> 00:42:14,177
Agree.  The husband's murdered to coerce her to sell.

396
00:42:14,379 --> 00:42:16,331
For the moment, the child's safe too, huh?

397
00:42:16,331 --> 00:42:18,753
Pending the mother's decision—agree.

398
00:42:18,753 --> 00:42:20,319
Safe then to let ‘em go, huh?

399
00:42:20,391 --> 00:42:22,392
I would, Sir. Yes.

400
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:26,827
Gonna take Mrs. Ellsworth home.

401
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,485
As you think  best.

402
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:34,297
I wish to thank you again, Mr. Swearengen.

403
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:38,724
We are all very grateful.

404
00:42:54,695 --> 00:42:59,345
Trixie's with Star at his place. No on knows but Shaunessey, who lives in fucking terror of me, huh?

405
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:03,460
Passages between their places only Shanessey knows.

406
00:43:04,408 --> 00:43:06,484
Heartfelt condolences, Madam.

407
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:12,563
I get to see Mr. Ellsworth tomorrow.

408
00:43:13,705 --> 00:43:16,694
Very good, young lady. God bless.

409
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,691
You take care of them, Bullock. Leave the other to me, huh?

410
00:43:21,953 --> 00:43:25,406
Oh, Bullock, you might want to stand guard outside her place.

411
00:43:25,274 --> 00:43:26,041
I'll take Charlie as backup.

412
00:43:26,463 --> 00:43:28,229
No no, Hearst ain't gonna be coming for her.

413
00:43:28,602 --> 00:43:32,500
But to bring the matter home as grave, it'd make a case for her selling her claim.

414
00:43:32,728 --> 00:43:35,682
Not to jeopardize the tranquility of your own hearth.

415
00:43:38,774 --> 00:43:40,543
Thank you for looking to them.

416
00:43:52,854 --> 00:43:56,493
Nimbleness, Lad, dexterity.

417
00:43:56,855 --> 00:43:59,260
I'd prefer Hearst's advantage at arms.

418
00:43:59,492 --> 00:44:03,491
True, true.  The world is less than perfect.

419
00:44:20,376 --> 00:44:22,645
The camp is galvanized.  

420
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:27,375
People scurry about.

421
00:44:27,204 --> 00:44:32,929
They've tasks to perform.  They feel important.

422
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:43,073
I oughtn't to work in these places. 

423
00:44:45,742 --> 00:44:49,128
I was not born to crush my own kind.

424
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:16,379
Right with you, Wu.  In there.  In there.  First door.

425
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:18,159
Yeah, in there.

426
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:31,366
When he leaves, 

427
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:38,096
them that ain't lining this fucking hallway like he's the tallest, best-looking white man ever got fucking lucky,

428
00:45:39,218 --> 00:45:41,064
better prepare for a fucking beating.

429
00:45:46,905 --> 00:45:54,903
Wu—Custer City—brings back all his Chinks the fuck back to Deadwood.

430
00:45:57,347 --> 00:46:02,220
Wu…back Deadwood?

431
00:46:04,781 --> 00:46:08,388
Brings all his Chinks back, huh?

432
00:46:09,247 --> 00:46:12,895
Wu, Custer City, back Deadwood!

433
00:46:13,497 --> 00:46:17,491
Ding n amah gai.  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday!

434
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:19,593
10 day, Swedgin!

435
00:46:19,968 --> 00:46:27,203
I am sorry, Wu.  I'm sorry I made you wait. But I want you to bring them now.

436
00:46:27,422 --> 00:46:29,109
While you're about your journey,

437
00:46:29,138 --> 00:46:33,841
I'll be trying to conceive some practical use for your countrymen's arrival

438
00:46:34,144 --> 00:46:37,205
besides seeming to swell our ranks. Oh, we'll give ‘em guns, yeah. 

439
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:39,159
We'll provide ‘em with guns,

440
00:46:39,746 --> 00:46:44,454
so any of the slant-eyed bastards know what one is, or, perish the thought, know how to use one—

441
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:46,894
we'll enhance our prospects.

442
00:46:47,784 --> 00:46:48,923
Guns. 

443
00:46:49,971 --> 00:46:51,627
Chung Kuo. 

444
00:46:52,212 --> 00:46:55,280
Wu, Custer City, back Deadwood.

445
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:59,562
150 Chunk Kuo cocksucker, Swedgin.

446
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:01,295
Shut the fuck up, Wu.

447
00:47:04,551 --> 00:47:06,157
Heng Dai.

448
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:14,749
Heng Dai. Heng Dai, fucking Wu.

449
00:47:32,145 --> 00:47:35,659
Big man. Wu—big man.

450
00:47:41,716 --> 00:47:45,841
Rouse him to spend on pussy, or rob the son of a bitch.

451
