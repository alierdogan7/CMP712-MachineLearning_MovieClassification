00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,434
(Music and chattering)

2
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,508
Hey, this thing
ain't working right.

3
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,955
It's working all right for me.

4
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,758
(Cheering)

5
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,278
(Applause )

6
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,676
(Landlord) Mary! Mary Roberts!

7
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,513
Get busy now. Here he is again.

8
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,516
What's up with you?
Why aren't you helping Lola?

9
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,795
I'm sorry, sir,
but the dishes...

10
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,668
Bother the dishes. You've got to
help her make her changes.

11
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,433
- Yes, sir.
- Now get going.

12
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,478
Come on, get going,
get going. Go on!

13
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,114
(All shout)
We want Lola! We want Lola!

14
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,393
(Silence )

15
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,074
Gentlemen, it's my aim

16
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,277
to give you the best
entertainment money can buy.

17
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,715
I've brought here
at great expense...

18
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,189
Get a piece of fat
and slide off!

19
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,793
Who said that?

20
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,592
(All scream )

21
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,993
All right, you'll get Lola.

22
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,599
(Laughter and shouting)

23
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,636
Hurry, they're getting restless.

24
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,871
- I gotta look good.
- They shot at me!

25
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,349
- Aw, quit your whining.
- Hurry!

26
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,149
If we ever get enough money,
we'll leave this one-horse tank.

27
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,468
Come on, hurry.

28
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,233
- How do I look?
- Like a million.

29
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,790
(Band plays )

30
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,075
(Applause and whistles )

31
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,031
# Say, I've been roamin'
from Frisco to Maine

32
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,759
# Been huntin' a man
that's not too tame

33
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,752
# He's gotta have somethin'
I need a lot

34
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,311
# Baby, dear,
that's what you've got

35
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,792
# Will you be my lovey-dovey,
my little honey man?

36
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,198
# We could bill and coo

37
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,113
- Baby!
- # The way all lovers do

38
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,558
# Will you be my ducky-wucky,
my little sugar pie?

39
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,157
# Never make you blue

40
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,232
# I'd be so sweet to you... #

41
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,598
Say, Finn, you're a lucky skate,
having a swell gal like Lola.

42
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,432
I certainly am.

43
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,999
What do you mean?

44
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,675
She's the lucky one,
having a swell fellow like me.

45
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,355
- # Will you be my lovey-dovey
- That's me.

46
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,557
# My little honey man?

47
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,349
# I'm a little bit lonesome... #

48
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,192
Have you seen my husband?

49
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,872
Yeah, over there.

50
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,396
# Won't you be my ownsome

51
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,916
- # My little turtle dove... #
- Will I?!

52
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,078
Waiter, I want a big bottle
of wine, right here!

53
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,470
Come on, this here's no good.

54
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,597
Sweetheart!

55
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,718
Oh!

56
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,110
(Whistling and cheering)

57
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,475
Hi, Charley. Hiya, boys.

58
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,313
Oh!

59
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,390
Watch where you're going!

60
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,116
(Whistles )

61
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,479
Hey, Ollie, look.
We're only two miles from town.

62
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,357
Well, I'll never make it.

63
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,193
I've got one foot
in the grave now.

64
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,871
Hey, stop him.
Maybe we can get a ride.

65
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,349
I'll get my clothes on.
Hurry up.

66
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,873
Whoa! Whoa!

67
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,678
(Screeching)

68
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,670
All right, mister. We're in.
Come on, Dinah. Come on.

69
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,195
Are you going
to Brushwood Gulch?

70
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,633
Uh-huh.

71
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,071
We are, too.

72
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,036
A lot of weather
we've been having lately.

73
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,073
Pretty.

74
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,789
It's only four months
to Christmas.

75
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,714
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

76
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,749
Do you mind
if I put my hand right here?

77
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,878
I saw her first. Come.

78
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,672
That's it.

79
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,637
Darling!

80
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,829
Not you! I meant my husband.

81
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,672
Have a nice trip, darling?

82
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,911
Lovely...
until these two came aboard.

83
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,754
They've done nothing
but annoy me all the way in.

84
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,273
Here, you run along home.

85
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,078
Goodbye.

86
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,435
Fiddlin', huh?

87
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,912
We don't like your kind
around these parts.

88
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,833
And there's one thing
we don't allow,

89
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,673
and that's messin'
with our women.

90
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,876
If you want to stay healthy,

91
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,394
get the next coach
out of town.

92
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,675
Yes, sir. We'll be glad to.

93
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,558
Just as soon as we've finished
our business.

94
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,029
If you miss the next coach...

95
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,556
you'll be riding out of here
in a hearse.

96
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,315
- Good day, strangers.
- Good day, sir.

97
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,118
Goodbye.

98
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,509
Let well enough alone.

99
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,113

Howdy, gents. What'll it be?

153
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,635
Do you know the whereabouts
of a lady named Mary Roberts?

154
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,349
(Bartender) Sure.
She's around here someplace.

155
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,831
I'm Miss Roberts' guardian.
What do you want to see her for?

156
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,990
We have some news for her.

157
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,752
What's it about?

158
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,674
I'm sorry, sir, but we're
not supposed to discuss that.

159
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,991
It's private. Her father died
and left her a goldmine.

160
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,674
We're not supposed
to tell anyone but her.

161
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,988
Didn't we, Ollie?

162
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,435
- A goldmine?
- It's the biggest...

163
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,717
Now that he's taken you
into our confidence,

164
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,553
you might as well know the rest.

165
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,309
(Whispers ) We've got
the deed to the property.

166
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,437
We have to give it
to her in person.

167
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,475
What?

168
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,519
I said we've got the deed
to the property and... Oh!

169
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,634
Say, you better show it to him.
Maybe he doesn't believe us.

170
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,632
It's the truth.

171
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,514
Say, did I give you the deed?

172
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,118
Oh, I know where it is.
Excuse me.

173
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,793
See? Mary Roberts.

174
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,439
Come here. Have you ever seen
Mary Roberts?

175
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,230
Good. I'll go and find her.
Don't tell a soul till I return.

176
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,278
- We won't.
- Thank you.

177
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,430
Good thing we found her.

178
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,952
Lola!

179
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,554
Lola, we've got a fortune
right in the palm of our hand.

180
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,675
What?

181
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,910
There's men downstairs
looking for Mary Roberts.

182
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,955
So?

183
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,033
They have a deed to a goldmine
left to her by her father.

184
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,156
They're here to deliver it.

185
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,276
Well, ain't that just grand?

186
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,511
It would be
if you were Mary Roberts.

187
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,068
Yeah, but I'd never
get away with it.

188
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,720
Sure you would!
They've never seen her.

189
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,358
Then it's a cinch.

190
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,636
Put that shoe on properly.

191
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,474
- What's wrong?
- I can't eat that.

192
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,676
It's as tough as shoe leather.

193
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,038
- Think you can do it?
- Can I do it(?)

194
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,588
For a goldmine,
I could be Cleopatra.

195
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,831
- That's the girl.
- Bring 'em up.

196
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,758
(Landlord) Hey!

197
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,832
- Come and meet Mary Roberts.
- Right away.

198
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,911
Did you call, Mr Finn?

199
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,670
Get back to the kitchen where
you belong. Don't bother me.

200
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,638
This way, gentlemen.
Come right this way.

201
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,878
This way, gentlemen.

202
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,278
Sit down and I'll get Lola...
I mean Mary for you.

203
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,670
I've told her the news
and she's terribly shocked.

204
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,117
- Lola, they're here.
- Swell, kiddo.

205
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,070
Put these in your arms.

206
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,199
Mary, these are the gentlemen
I was telling you about.

207
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,238
(Clop!)

208
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,672
Tell me... Tell me
about my dear, dear daddy.

209
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,069
Is it true that he's dead?

210
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,118
Well, we hope he is.
They buried him.

211
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,477
It can't be. What did he die of?

212
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,076
I think he died of a Tuesday.
Or was it Wednesday? Do you...?

213
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,991
I'll handle
this delicate situation.

214
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,196
Little lady,
you've heard the worst.

215
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,033
Now prepare yourself
for the best.

216
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,078
Now, cheer up.
Smile. That's right.

217
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,439
Remember, every cloud
has a silver lining.

218
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,796
That's right.
Any bird can build a nest,

219
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,714
but it isn't everyone that can
lay an egg, is it, Ollie?

220
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,949
That's right.

221
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,190
Do you know you own one of the
richest goldmines in the world?

222
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,872
Your father left you
the whole property.

223
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,830
And he gave me the honour
of presenting you with the deed.

224
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,310
- Isn't it wonderful, Uncle?
- Yes, my dear.

225
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,353
Who's there?

226
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,000
- Mary.
- Mary who?

227
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,036
Mary... Merry Christmas.

228
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,873
Excuse me, Mr Finn.

229
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,952
One gentleman
dropped this on the stairs.

230
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,431
Ooh, thank you, little lady.
You don't know what you've done.

231
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,239
All right. All right. All right.

232
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,916
There you are.
Signed, sealed and now...

233
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,558
delivered.

234
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,598
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.

235
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,712
Come, Stanley. We'd better go.

236
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,189
Oh, say. What about the locket?

237
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,475
- That's right...
- We've something else.

238
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,312
I almost forgot.

239
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,876
And besides that...

240
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,829
your father left you
this family heirloom.

241
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,070
Oh, yes. I remember it well.

242
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,515
Help me get it off, Stanley.

243
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,511
Am I hurting you?

244
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,909
No. Just a minute...

245
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,752
Won't be long.

246
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,549
Maybe I'd better try
opening it again.

247
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,073
I think so.

248
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,198
(Whispers ) Slipped.

249
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,912
Maybe you'd better
take your coat off.

250
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,956
Pardon me just a minute.

251
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,273
We'll find it in just a moment.

252
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,078
We got it.

253
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,354
I'll go in and change.
Pardon us.

254
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,876
- Say, Ollie?
- What?

255
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,270
Now that you're undressed,
why not take a bath?

256
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,797
Would you mind leaving the room?
Can't I have a little privacy?

257
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,429
Just trying to kill two birds
with one stone.

258
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,789
I'll take care of those bozos.

259
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,351
Don't worry, leave it to me.
I've done pretty good so far.

260
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,557
You certainly have.
I wish you were in my shoes.

261
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,269
- (Coughs ) How about a drink?
- That suits me fine.

262
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,239
- How did you dress so quick?
- None of your business.

263
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,198
Goodbye, and thanks
for the use of your boudoir.

264
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,191
- You're very welcome.
- Goodbye.

265
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,239
Now you have the mine,
you'll be a swell gold-digger.

266
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,117
Goodbye.

267
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,157
Why did you leave them?

268
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,879
You have her sign
the deeds over to us.

269
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,349
You get those guys
out of town now!

270
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,953
All right.

271
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,272
What a cinch.

272
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,080
Give the gentlemen the best
in the house.

273
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,513
Yes, sir.

274
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,556
I'll be back in a minute.

275
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,552
# On a mountain in Virginia

276
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,196
# Stands a lonesome pine

277
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,633
# Just below is the cabin home

278
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,235
# Of a little girl of mine

279
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,996
# Her name is June
and very, very soon

280
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,550
# She'll belong to me

281
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,872
# For I know
she's waiting there for me

282
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,918
# 'Neath that lone pine tree

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,153

(Snores )

302
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,232
That's fine.

303
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,515
Miss Lola, what is this for?

304
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,990
Er... Now whatever we do
on your behalf is legal.

305
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,559
Thank you very much.

306
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,394
Don't mention it. Now run right
along with your work.

307
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,511
Well, here's looking at you.

308
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,556
(Growling)

309
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,798
Shoo!

310
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,956
- Well, I've got to be going.
- So have we.

311
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,792
- Goodbye, Mr Finn.
- Goodbye.

312
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,632
- Goodbye, mister.
- Goodbye, sir.

313
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,039
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

314
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,758
Have a good time.

315
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,717
Goodbye, Miss, er...? Miss...?

316
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,995
Roberts. Mary Roberts.

317
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,230
- Goodbye, Miss Roberts.
- Goodbye.

318
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,840
Did you hear what her name was?

319
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,399
Sure - Mary Roberts.

320
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,075
How can she be if we've just
given the deed to Mary Roberts?

321
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,513
I don't know.

322
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,589
- I smell a rat.
- I smell something, too.

323
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,477
(Sizzling)

324
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,272
Come on.

325
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,552
Pardon me.

326
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,598
Did you ever have
a father called Sy Roberts?

327
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,151
Why, yes. He left me with these
people when he went prospecting.

328
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,231
Who's that woman upstairs?

329
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,709
Lola Marcel. Mr Finn's wife.

330
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,836
She's my legal guardian now.

331
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,351
Can I speak to you?

332
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,398
- Pardon us.
- We'll be right back.

333
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,554
- You know what?
- What?

334
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,712
I think we've given that deed
to the wrong woman.

335
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,713
Our first mistake since that guy
sold us the Brooklyn Bridge.

336
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,873
That was no mistake. It'll be
worth a lot of money some day.

337
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,269
Maybe you're right.
Let's get the deed.

338
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,794
Say, maybe they won't
give it back to us?

339
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,518
What do you mean?

340
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,398
We'll get that deed
or I'll eat your hat.

341
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,438
That's what
I call determination.

342
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,873
Come on.

343
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,955
Splendid! Splendid!

344
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,679
She fell for it
like you fell for me.

345
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,832
Lola, my girl,
we're sittin' pretty.

346
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,439
- Who's there?
- Me.

347
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,830
- Me who?
- Me who(!)

348
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,358
What do you want?

349
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,908
Out of my way,
you snake in the grass!

350
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,635
You toad in the hole.

351
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,909
Say, what do ya mean
bustin' in here like this?

352
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,958
We want to know
why you're not Mary Roberts.

353
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,632
I'll take care of this.

354
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,153
So, you got wise?

355
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,596
If it's this deed you're after,
you're out of luck.

356
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,477
Take it, Stan. Beat it!

357
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,918
That's it. There you are!

358
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,952
Ow! Ow! AAAH!

359
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,235
AAAH!

360
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,315
(Puffs )

361
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,118
That's it!

362
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,112
Get it, Stan! Get it!

363
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,668
Go on, get it! Go on, Stan!

364
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,149
Go on and get it, Stan!

365
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,834
Give me that deed.

366
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,719
Get away! Get away!

367
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,870
Why don't you...?

368
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,830
Give me that!

369
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,558
Go on, get it.

370
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,269
Get away from that door!
Get away from it!

371
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,831
Now, you stop.

372
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,990
Stop!

373
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,957
(Laughs )

374
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,995
Back! Steady! Get back.

375
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,956
(Squeals) Ollie,
come and get...

376
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,076
Don't you touch that!

377
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,952
Stop! Ooh, you're tickling!

378
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,751
Not yet! Not yet!

379
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,920
Stay where you are. Don't move!

380
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,194
Ah-ha!

381
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,599
Ho-ho!

382
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,432
Hee-hee!

383
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,798
(Ollie yelling)

384
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,236
Here, Stan, take it!

385
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,311
I can't stand it!

386
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,836
Now, get 'em outta here.

387
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,916
(Finn ) Get out!

388
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,758
Now! Get out!

389
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,193
(Knock on door)

390
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,236
- Who's there?
- The Sheriff.

391
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,279
Just in the nick of time.
Now we'll get justice.

392
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,919
Sheriff, you're just the man
I'm looking for.

393
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,833
And you're just the man
I'M looking for.

394
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,071
Thank you. This man... Oh.

395
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,513
(Laughs even more )

396
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,918
I thought I told you two dudes
to catch the next coach.

397
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,319
Yes, sir.

398
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,152
It left ten minutes ago.

399
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,596
It did? Maybe we'd better
try and catch it.

400
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,398
I'll say you better!

401
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,833
(Gunshots )

402
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,153
Look at them go!

403
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,913
You can't see them for dust.

404
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,990
- Say, Ollie?
- What?

405
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,914
Are we taking a chance going
back and robbing that safe?

406
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,151
Chance or no chance,
we must get that deed back.

407
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,756
As soon as my clothes are dry,
that's exactly what we'll do.

408
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,515
That's a good idea.
If that girl ever found out...

409
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,556
Give me a light.

410
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,795
Those matches are soaking wet.

411
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,798
Thank you.

412
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,110
See if my clothes are dry.

413
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,672
Your hat's dry.

414
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,270
That reminds me, you made
a statement this afternoon.

415
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,918
Did I?

416
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,630
You said if we didn't get
the deed, you'd eat my hat.

417
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,915
Now you're taking me
illiterally.

418
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,391
Nevertheless, I'm going to teach
you not to make rash promises.

419
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,232
Eat the hat.

420
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,756
That's silly. Who ever heard
of anybody eating a hat?

421
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,832
Who ever heard
of anybody doing that?

422
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,878
- Eat the hat.
- I won't do it.

423
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,313
If you don't,

424
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,155
I'll tie you to a tree
and let the buzzards get you.

425
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,992
- Would you really?
- I certainly would.

426
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,791
(Squeaks ) I never ate a hat.

427
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,233
Eat it.

428
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,593
(Boing!)

429
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,598
(Twang!)

430
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,192
(Ripping)

431
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,038
(Ripping)

432
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,152
Get my clothes.

433
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,873
Ow!

434
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,518
Shh!

435
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,958
(Whispers ) Wait a minute.
I'll help you.

436
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,314
(Alarm bell rings )

437
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,198
What did you push me
in there like that for?

438
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,396
You're the dumbest thing
I ever saw.

439
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,390
(Whispers ) Hey, hey,
I've got an idea.

440
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,995
Why don't we climb on the shed,
get on the balcony

441
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,356
and go in there
to save us going in the front?

442
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,477
Now, that deserves
consideration.

443
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:21,115
Hey! Psst! Psst!
Hey, Ollie! Psst!

444
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,191
Are you all right? Psst!

445
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,911
Wait. I'll get a ladder for you.
Won't be a minute. Shh!

446
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,990
I'm going
to get a ladder for him.

447
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,752
- Shh!
- Shh!

448
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,150
We'll follow our original plan
and go through the front.

449
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,037
Now, go ahead.

450
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,432
Do you mind
if I have another idea?

451
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,354
If it's anything like the last
one, yes. What is it?

452
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,070
How about me pulling you up
on the block and tackle?

453
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,713
What are you doing out here?

454
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,313
There's something wrong...

455
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,313
Yes, it's you. Come back to bed.
Scaring me to death...

456
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,638
Here, hold that.

457
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,755
Now, are you all ready?
Upsadaisy.

458
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,355
Now, don't get fancy.
Just get me up there.

459
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,433
(Creaking)

460
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,389
Wait till I spit on my hands.

461
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,516
All right... No!

462
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,511
Upsadaisy.

463
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,838
I'll spit on 'em
again to make sure.

464
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,318
(Creaking)

465
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,753
Uh!

466
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,068
Hand me the end of that rope.

467
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,190
Now hold out your hand.

468
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,271
Hold out your hand.

469
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,398
This one.

470
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,235
Now tie that on the mule.

471
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,796
Tie that on the mule.

472
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,632
Get on the mule.

473
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,109
Get on the mule.

474
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,358
(Clicks teeth)

475
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,713
Hey!

476
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,637
- Where are the tools?
- In the saddlebag.

477
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,472
Hand them to me.

478
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,118
OK.

479
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,552
I'll be right over.

480
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,871
(Ollie yells)

481
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,076
What are you trying to do?

482
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,718
Get the mule down.

483
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,268
Not now.
We'll attend to that later.

484
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,432
- Maybe we can get in here.
- Good idea.

485
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,714
(Hisses )

486
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,475
- Shh!
- Shh!

487
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,156
- Wait there. We'll be right up.
- Shh!

488
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,393
(Brays )

489
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,155
What's the matter?

490
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,277
- Stop laughing in your sleep.
- I'm not.

491
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,874
I'd know your laugh anywhere.
Go to sleep!

492
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,554
Keeping me awake
all night like this...

493
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,919
Psst!

494
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,152
(Whistles )

495
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,514
Shh!

496
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,839
(Screams )

497
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,478
(Ollie ) Ow!

498
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,268
What are you doing here?

499
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,557
As soon as I get out of here,
I'll explain.

500
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,596
(Finn ) Mary!
What are you doing?

501
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,511
Hide me! Hide me!

502
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,238
(Finn ) What's that noise
down there?

503
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,753
(Finn ) Answer me!

504
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,515
Mary!

505
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,914
No! You must hide.

506
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,993
(Finn ) Mary, what's going on
down there? What's that noise?

507
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,515
Why are you roaming around
this late?

508
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,431
- Mr Finn, I...
- You...

509
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,195
Get back to bed and not another
peep out of you.

510
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,430
The idea.

511
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,269
Oh! Oh! Oh!

512
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,638
Shh!

513
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,875
Please, what are you doing here?

514
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,918
Come in and I'll tell you
all about it.

515
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,757
- Ollie.
- What?

516
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,877
Wait there.
I'll be right back. Shh!

517
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,558
(Silence )

518
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,994
You put on your clothes
and we'll see you later. Shh!

519
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,793
Ooh!

520
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,269
- Where have you been?
- I told Mary what happened.

521
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,636
When you get the deed,
she'll leave with us.

522
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,438
Good. Where is she now?

523
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,114
She's getting dressed.
She'll meet us outside.

524
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,873
Fine. Now get me out of this.

525
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,473
OK.

526
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,155
Take it easy, now.

527
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,829
You can't...

528
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,196
You can't do it that way.

529
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,632
(Creaking)

530
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,435
Take it easy. Shh!

531
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,394
Maybe I can pull you up
this way.

532
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,314
Maybe I can pull you
all the way through.

533
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,277
Let go, you're choking...

534
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,918
Oh, me apple!

535
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,399
Are you all right?

536
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,673
(Rattle )

537
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,273
(Whirring)

538
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,358
(Rattle of coins )

539
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,313
Oh!

540
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,313
What did you go and do that for?

541
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,992
Well, I didn't know...

542
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,793
Shh!

543
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,751
(Yells in panic)

544
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,558
(Finn ) Mary!
What are you doing down there?

545
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,959
What's going on?

546
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,873
(Finn ) Mary! Mary!

547
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,553
(Finn ) Mary!

548
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,913
(Finn ) Mary!

549
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,391
Will you move over?

550
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,879
(Strums piano strings )

551
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,189
(Furious playing)

552
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,238
Aaah! Oh!

553
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,592
Give me that gun!

554
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,636
Put up your hands! Not you!

555
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,473
- What are you doing?
- Getting those deeds back.

556
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,518
- You can't do that!
- Go on! Go on!

557
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,396
Now get in that room. Go on!
Open the safe and get the deed.

558
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,879
Hurry up.

559
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,553
(Screams )

560
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,559
Get back in that room. Go on.
Now give us that deed.

561
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,318
Come on, take it, Stan.

562
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,960
Get in there and get to bed.

563
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,548
- I-I-I...
- Go on! Shut up!

564
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,192
You can't get away...

565
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,192
- Get in that bed.
- I'll fix you.

566
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,190
Tie him up.

567
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,716
- What are you going to do?
- Never mind.

568
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,554
- Stop that. You can't do that!
- Shut up. Shut up.

569
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,756
You can't do this.
I'll get you for this.

570
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,832
Go and get Dinah.
I'll take care of him.

571
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,390
Let me out of this.
Let me go. You can't do that.

572
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,839
Stop that. Let me down.
Let me outta here.

573
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,797
What are you going to do?

574
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:46,228
I'll get you for this. Let
me go! Let me go! Help! Lola!

575
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:50,108
Lola! Lola! Lola! Lola!

576
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,713
Help me, Lola!

577
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,193
Oh!

578
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,033
Hey, come back here! Come back!

579
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,434
Come back! Come back!

580
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,876
Let me out!
Stop! Come back here!

581
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,589
Now our troubles are over,
where do we go from here?

582
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,910
I'd like to return
to my hometown.

583
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,355
- Where's that?
- Way down south.

584
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,954
- You're from the South?
- Sure am.

585
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,952
Well, fan my brow!
I'm from the South.

586
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,393
You are?

587
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:46,199
Well, shut my mouth!
I is from the South, too.

588
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,077
South of what, sir?

589
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,798
The south of London.

590
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,476
London! Well, honey,
we'll all go down to Dixie.

591
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:58,189
Oh, for a slice
of possum and yam. Ooh!

592
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,795
Yes, sir, and some
good ol' fish and chips.

593
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,359
Fish and chips(!)

594
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,115
# We're going to go,

595
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,909
# We're going to go

597
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,917
# Scrambled eggs

598

600
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,914
# You can tell the world

601
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,718
(Mary and Ollie ) # D.I.X... #

602
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,153
I know how to spell it.

603
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,992
- # Then we're going
- # Oh, yes, we're going

604
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,718
