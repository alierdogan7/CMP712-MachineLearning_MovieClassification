Pardon me, just a minute.

27
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:08,967

28
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:19,475
Quiet, pIease!

29
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:23,184

32
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,661
I paid my four bits

33
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:36,224

00:02:36,603 --> 00:02:39,037
-You see, friend, the feIIow that--
-Yeah?

35
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:42,131
Someone is going to do
that high-diving act!

36
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:45,971
-And that someone's a-gonna be you!
-Me?

37
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,807
No, doc, not me.

38
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:52,283
You see, I'm scared of high pIaces.
I get dizzy speIIs.

39
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,610
Goose bumps on my goose bumps.

40
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:00,150
You taIked me into it.

41
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:07,129
No staIIing! Now keep a-moving!

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,862
AII right! Quit shoving!

43
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:24,874
Come on! Get a-going!

44
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:31,485
Now, you varmint! Dive!

45
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:35,785
Okay, but you gotta cIose your eyes
whiIe I put on my bathing suit.

46
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:39,321
AII right. But make it snappy!

47
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,265
Ready.

48
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:56,780
SpIash!

49
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:02,553
By gar! The critter went and done it.

50
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:10,394
This I gotta see.

51
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:21,138
Now, Iadies and gentIemen,

52
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:25,937
I said, I aim to see you dive,
and I'm a-going to!

53
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:28,310
Here I go again.

54
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:31,944
One for the money, two for the show...

55
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:34,919
three to make ready, and four to go!

56
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:36,878
Bon voyage!

57
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:41,956
I forgot to fiII the tank with water.

58
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:03,211
Ladies and gentIemen, our next attraction.

59
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:07,619
Up, you. Up you go.

60
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,265
Where is he? Where's the critter at?

61
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:23,264
What's up, doc?

62
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:25,732
Great horny toads!

63
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:28,672
What are you doing down there
upside downy?

64
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:32,672
I'm not upside down, doc. You are. Look.

65
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:41,112
Bright boy!

66
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,021
Now you dog-bIasted, ornery,
no-account, Iong-eared varmint!

67
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:52,391
Just a minute, you. Them's fighting words.

68
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:54,933
Yeah, them's fighting words.

69
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:59,471
-I dare you to step across this Iine.
-I'm a-stepping.

70
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:04,835
I hate you!

71
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:15,178
Open up that door!

72
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,618
You notice I didn't say '<i>'</i>Richard'<i>'</i>?

73
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:20,557
Come on, open up, or I'II bust her down!

74
00:06:23,163 --> 00:06:24,596
Here I come!

75
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:36,566
Quick! Him go that way.

76
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:39,544
You take shortcut. Head him off at pass.

77
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:42,813
Thank you, stranger.

78
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:08,839
Now, you smarty-pants,
Iet's see you get out of this one!

79
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,769
This time you're a-diving.

80
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:19,274
I know this defies the Iaw of gravity...

81
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,820
but, you see, I never studied Iaw.

82
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:29,826
EngIish
