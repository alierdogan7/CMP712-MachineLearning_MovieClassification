1
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:43,363
Listen to this! Listen to this,
you fellows! You fellows, listen!

2
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:47,406
General Grant chased the Rebs
out of Richmond four days ago.

3
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:51,117
And it's rumored that Lee's
already surrendered.

4
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:53,319
The war is over!

5
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:59,279
[GUNSHOTS]

6
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:48,562
- Here's the captain's papers.
- Get those Yanks out of here.

7
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:52,117
All right, you two,
get this body out of here.

8
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,642
Pardee, get
these men out of sight.

9
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:56,525
Now, come on,
let's go.

10
00:03:56,727 --> 00:03:59,116
Hurry it up, Mike.
Hurry it up.

11
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:24,400
- Captain Cagle?
- Yes.

12
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:27,923
- Brevet Major Harris.
- We've been expecting you.

13
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:30,721
Here's the warrant for the payroll.

14
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:43,926
Well, you brought a very small
guard for this much money.

15
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:48,559
- There's no Rebs within 50 miles.
- What about Randall's Raiders?

16
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:54,085
We drove them clear out of Louisiana
with their tails between their legs.

17
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:55,720
Well...

18
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:58,117
...all right. Hand it down.

19
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:01,884
Where's the station agent?

20
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:05,921
He got taken sick. One of
the boys took him back to camp.

21
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:17,718
Where you going?

22
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,325
- Back to the train.
- Go ahead.

23
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,799
Stand beside it with your mouth
shut and get on when it pulls out.

24
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,527
I'll be watching you
from this window.

25
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:05,926
Sign this receipt. Get that
money to your camp in a hurry.

26
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:34,439
Stop them, major!
They shot the station agent!

27
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:38,316
Get after them, you fools!
They stole your payroll.

28
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:49,406
- You all right?
- Yeah. Get out of here.

29
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:52,723
Fire at them, they're rebels!

30
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:13,724
Hey, lieutenant. Ain't that a federal
offense, breaking open them boxes?

31
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:18,636
Ain't that a beautiful sight?

32
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:22,436
Makes you feel like a kitten
with a whole basin of milk.

33
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:27,920
- What a pity it don't belong to us.
- How much you figure it comes to?

34
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:32,525
$ 12,250.

35
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:37,757
Lieutenant, how about making
that a neat, round sum?

36
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:41,715
Say $ 10,000, and us fellows
dividing up the difference?

37
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:44,799
You thieving rat.
The Army would shoot us.

38
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,923
Well, who would tell?

39
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:49,960
- I wouldn't, for one.
- Me neither.

40
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:54,564
Look at us. A bunch of starved
scarecrows, whipped and dead broke.

41
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:58,242
All we got from this war is
shriveled guts and saddle sores.

42
00:07:58,407 --> 00:08:02,036
You got a tempting argument.
I doubt if it's legal.

43
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:04,516
It ain't legal, Vance, or moral.

44
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:07,440
Confederacy can use
that money more than us.

45
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:12,158
You're right. Tomorrow we're taking
this money to General Randall.

46
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:16,764
Well, we tried anyway.
Let's get into this grub.

47
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:31,843
- Regiments broke camp and moved out.
- But where to?

48
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:35,044
General said they'd
wait for us right here.

49
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:37,801
Been away eight days.
Might've been attacked.

50
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:40,117
Or ordered away all of a sudden.

51
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,925
We better ride into
Claysville and find out.

52
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,599
VANCE:
What's your regiment?

53
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:08,801
Fifth Louisiana Rifles,
or what's left of them.

54
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,639
Where's Randall's outfit?

55
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:13,640
The cavalry disbanded
two or three days ago.

56
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:16,765
Scattered so as
not to give up the horses.

57
00:09:16,927 --> 00:09:21,318
You fellows should do likewise
before the Yanks confiscate them.

58
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:25,242
Wait a minute. What are you
talking about? What happened?

59
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:28,240
What's happened?
You mean you ain't heard?

60
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:31,524
General Lee surrendered
to Grant five days ago.

61
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:34,520
Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia.

62
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:40,125
- Surrendered? You're crazy.
- No, that's a fact, lieutenant.

63
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:43,643
All of us gave up our guns
in Shreveport last Monday.

64
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:46,446
So war's over.
We can all go home.

65
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:48,922
MAN:
If you've got one left to go to.

66
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:05,840
Now that the brigade's scattered,
how we gonna find the general?

67
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:09,363
- That's just it. We can't.
- We gotta try, Vance.

68
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:11,962
- Why?
- Why?

69
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:14,516
To give him
the money, of course.

70
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:17,804
I don't know.
The surrender changes everything.

71
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:20,117
We gotta talk it over.

72
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:32,996
We can't take this money.
It don't rightly belong to us.

73
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,920
Then tell us who it
does rightly belong to.

74
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:39,802
It belongs to the Confederate
government, I suppose.

75
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:43,846
There ain't no more Confederate
government. It's finished.

76
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:45,156
That's the truth.

77
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:49,240
They'll hang Jeff Davis and
throw all the others in prison.

78
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:52,922
Well, then it must still
be Federal property.

79
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:56,398
You mean we ought
to give it back to them?

80
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:59,400
A minnie ball in my leg's
got to be paid for.

81
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:03,719
Your brother nearly died
of gangrene in a Yankee prison.

82
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:08,244
We didn't steal this money.
We took it in battle, fair and square.

83
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:12,116
It's called "spoils of war,"
like capturing a horse.

84
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:15,245
We and the Federals
didn't know it was over.

85
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:17,125
So it's still prize money.

86
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:22,520
It's ours. You don't have to take
your share, if it sticks in your craw.

87
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:26,516
How do you feel about this, Ray?

88
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,719
What Vance says makes sense.

89
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:32,243
If we got a right to it,
we're fools not to take it.

90
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:34,637
It's settled.
I got it figured out.

91
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:39,324
We got $ 1750
apiece coming to us.

92
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:41,921
Wait until I get
to Georgia with this.

93
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:44,806
I'll buy a hog, a dog
and a rocking chair.

94
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:48,243
We all three just gonna
sit there and scratch.

95
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,365
We'll fix us up the best
farm in east Texas.

96
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:54,758
You bet. But first...

97
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,441
...I'm gonna get married.

98
00:11:57,607 --> 00:12:02,806
Cathy's been waiting four years.
It seems more like 40 to me.

99
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:09,721
And now, instead of going back
to her empty-handed, I got this money.

100
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,719
Yanks!

101
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,925
Look at them. All brave and
sassy now that they licked us.

102
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:48,365
Not us, Mike.
Maybe the South is licked...

103
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:50,325
...but not us.

104
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:55,322
Still, it's smarter if we
split up here and now.

105
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,997
- So long, Mike.
- So long, Vance.

106
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:03,843
Whenever you get to Texas,
you know where to find me.

107
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:07,443
I ain't ever gonna leave
that rocking chair.

108
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,645
- Goodbye, Brett. Lots of luck.
- Thank you.

109
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:12,718
- Goodbye.
- Sarge.

110
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,521
You're new here.
What happened to McComb?

111
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:49,841
Joined the Army. I'm minding the store
until he's back. If he's still alive.

112
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:52,282
You think Ma would
like this bonnet?

113
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:55,280
That's pretty. See
if there's a fancy one...

114
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:58,007
...with lace and pink
ribbons for Cathy.

115
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:02,558
That's the only one I got left.
Anyhow, who feels free nowadays?

116
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:06,038
He does! He's going
home to get married.

117
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:09,597
If we clean him up so his
sweetheart recognizes him.

118
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:13,396
Don't worry. Cathy would
know me a mile away.

119
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:20,325
Wish I could take her a real nice
present like a gold ring or bracelet.

120
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,724
Sorry. That's all
the female finery I got left.

121
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:28,159
Except this here bustle, which
I've been using for a mousetrap.

122
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:31,638
- Give us that too.
- Hey, Vance...

123
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:35,323
...now, this is fit and proper
for a bridegroom.

124
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:40,836
- It's just your size.
- This feels like real broadcloth.

125
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:44,556
Sure is. Probably the last
good suit left in the state.

126
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:45,716
How much?

127
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:48,447
With the pants,
that will cost you $ 14.

128
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:51,041
I'll throw in a pair
of galluses free.

129
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:53,960
Hard money!
No Confederate shinplasters.

130
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,721
This look hard enough for you?

131
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:02,439
A $20 Federal bill. I ain't
seen one of these since '63.

132
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:06,646
- That cover what we owe you?
- Sure, I'll go wrap them up.

133
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:11,886
Jethro! Well, I'll be
dad-burned if it ain't old Jethro!

134
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:15,238
- You're a sight for sore eyes.
- Old rascal.

135
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:17,967
How'd you stay
alive all these years?

136
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:21,642
What's the matter?
We ain't changed that much.

137
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:24,321
You look kind of
surprised to see us.

138
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:30,125
- We all heard you was dead, Mr. Vance.
- Well, he done near was.

139
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:33,160
That minnie ball misspelled
my name a little.

140
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:37,241
You mean, our folks
don't even know I'm alive?

141
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:40,997
No, sir. Nobody does.

142
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:43,840
We'll ride by Cathy's
house and tell her.

143
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:50,116
She ain't there no more. Her folks was
killed in the same raid your pa was.

144
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:55,317
- Where is she?
- Your place. Moved in with your ma.

145
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:19,516
VANCE:
Strange how things work out.

146
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:25,717
We go off and fight four years. But
they come and kill him here at home.

147
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:34,517
BRETT: The place looks mighty rundown.
RAY: Plumb wore out, like us.

148
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,719
Come on, let's go in
yelling like we used to.

149
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:42,281
[YELLING]

150
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:06,726
Ma?

151
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:18,723
My son!

152
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:24,118
They told me you were dead.

153
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,927
They were almost right.

154
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,761
But here's what's left of me, Ma.

155
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,319
Just think. All three of you.

156
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,325
Brett!

157
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,118
Ray.

158
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:43,520
All my sons. Home again.

159
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:45,605
Clint!

160
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,964
Clint!

161
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:50,959
Clint!

162
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:57,120
Clint, come running!

163
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:02,485
Cathy! Cathy!

164
00:18:17,007 --> 00:18:18,326
Vance.

165
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,320
Cathy.

166
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:33,125
Let me have a good
look at you, honey.

167
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:38,845
Yeah, that's just how I've seen you
night and day for four years...

168
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:41,123
...except for those britches.

169
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:45,527
Clint! Clint!

170
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:54,835
Vance!

171
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:56,998
Oh, no!

172
00:18:57,807 --> 00:19:02,722
This can't be the sprat!
Look at how he's grown and filled out.

173
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:07,438
- He's almost a man, ain't he, Cathy?
- They told us you were dead.

174
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:12,681
Yeah, I know. I know. Now, come on.
Come on. Tell me about you all.

175
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,644
We got a heap
of work to do.

176
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:18,846
First thing, get Cathy out
of those britches and into a dress.

177
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:23,523
I try, but she works harder than
a mule all day helping me and Ma.

178
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:26,161
Not anymore.
We got three farm hands.

179
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:30,719
Come on, I got
a bushel of things to tell you.

180
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:37,725
Vance? I don't reckon you
could have known about this...

181
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:42,523
...but me and Cathy got married
about three months ago.

182
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:55,923
Married?

183
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:03,758
Well, this is a...

184
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:06,680
This is a day of surprises all around.

185
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,683
I don't know what we'd
have done without Cathy.

186
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:13,481
Or her without us after
her folks died.

187
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,798
We had poor scratching
to keep body and soul together...

188
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,123
...waiting for the war to end.

189
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,921
Well, it must've been hard.

190
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:26,124
Well...

191
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:30,840
...congratulations, Clint.

192
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:36,764
We always did want Cathy
in the family, didn't we, Ma?

193
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:38,918
Yes, son.

194
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:41,918
Always.

195
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:49,722
Hey, Cathy.

196
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:51,923
Look at the nicks
on this saber.

197
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:54,157
How many Yankees
did you all get?

198
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:56,841
- We didn't stop to count.
- Whole bunch?

199
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,965
Most of those nicks
came from butchering pigs.

200
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:03,199
I'll bet. A blue one
with the brass buttons.

201
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,198
Wish I would've been there.

202
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:07,881
I bet you I would've gotten my share.

203
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:11,244
He ranted and raved whenever
we got news of a battle.

204
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:14,558
You did right to stay here,
Clint. You did fine.

205
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:19,517
I love my bonnet. You boys shouldn't
have spent what little you got on me.

206
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:24,085
That's a mighty poor gift,
Ma, for all you've given us.

207
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:27,724
CLINT:
Hey! Look here.

208
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:31,519
A brand new Sunday-go-to-meeting suit.

209
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:36,559
That's a present for you.
From all of us.

210
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:40,163
For me? It must've cost a fortune.

211
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:43,644
- Where'd you get money?
- We had some saved up.

212
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:47,641
- We still got a few dollars left.
- That's more than we got.

213
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,196
Sit down while everything's hot.

214
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:53,723
Come on, Clint.
You're hungry, aren't you?

215
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:11,562
Dear Lord, I thank you most kindly for
bringing my boys home safe and sound.

216
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:34,123
It's sure good
to hear him sing.

217
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:36,847
It sure is. All we're
missing now is Pa.

218
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:39,726
Remember we all used
to sit here and sing?

219
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:42,526
Indeed. Brings back
a heap of good memories.

220
00:24:42,687 --> 00:24:44,723
Vance used to sing the loudest.

221
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:47,117
This one was his favorite.

222
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:30,842
If we wanna get to work before
sunup, we better turn in.

223
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:33,601
A lot of things around
here need fixing.

224
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:44,759
What's troubling you, Vance?
You ain't your old self tonight.

225
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:46,918
Oh, I'm all right.

226
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:50,921
A little tired, I reckon.

227
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:53,319
Vance...

228
00:27:55,127 --> 00:28:00,565
...I know you and Cathy used to be
kind of fond of each other, but...

229
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:04,606
You ain't got no hard feelings
against either of us, have you?

230
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:08,726
Hard feelings? Me?
Why, of course not.

231
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:11,561
You really mean that?
Down deep?

232
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:14,162
- Listen, did I ever lie to you?
- No.

233
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:19,959
All right. Oh, I liked Cathy,
sure. But we all did.

234
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:24,041
But I was never
in love with her.

235
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:28,644
We were just real good friends.

236
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:31,526
And that's how it still is.

237
00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:34,765
So don't you ever
think nothing else.

238
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:36,520
Why...

239
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:40,326
...I'm just happy for both of you.

240
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:44,041
I hoped it'd be that way, Vance.

241
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:52,522
We're so much in love.
I could never tell you.

242
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,359
You don't have to.

243
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:59,635
It's written all over your
face. And hers too.

244
00:29:09,527 --> 00:29:12,485
You go on to bed.
I'm gonna lock the barn.

245
00:29:12,647 --> 00:29:16,526
There's a lot of stragglers.
They might steal our horses.

246
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:21,522
You can't even trust a Reb nowadays.
I'll see you in the morning.

247
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:47,963
Vance, you've gotta
let me talk to you.

248
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:50,960
You never said
one word to me tonight.

249
00:29:51,127 --> 00:29:53,960
- Please let me explain.
- Nothing to explain.

250
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:57,119
Oh, but there is.
Please let me...

251
00:29:57,367 --> 00:30:00,325
Give me a chance to tell you...

252
00:30:01,487 --> 00:30:03,523
Coming to bed, Vance?

253
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,883
Vance?

254
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:49,562
How soon you figure we can tell folks
about the money?

255
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:54,198
A couple months. We'll spend a little
at a time so as not to start talk.

256
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:55,880
You're the boss, Vance.

257
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:59,926
We gotta buy seed if we hope
to get a good crop this summer.

258
00:31:00,087 --> 00:31:01,759
The crop'll have to wait.

259
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:05,840
The money we got hidden in here
is a lot better than seed.

260
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:37,446
Vance.

261
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:43,040
Your mare worked her shoe loose.

262
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:45,163
It's all right now.

263
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:49,957
Please, I've been trying to see you
alone for over a week now.

264
00:31:51,447 --> 00:31:54,598
Won't you even try and understand?

265
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:57,202
No one asks why a woman
gets married.

266
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:59,642
You do. You ask me with every look.

267
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:02,446
You've no right to think
I was faithless.

268
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:06,122
I waited for you,
just like I promised.

269
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:11,361
I thought about you all day long,
and prayed for you every night.

270
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,725
Then that letter came
saying you were dead.

271
00:32:14,887 --> 00:32:17,845
I didn't want to live myself anymore.

272
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:21,795
I loved you, Vance.

273
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:24,083
With all my heart and soul.

274
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:27,922
You know I did.
How can you doubt it?

275
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:30,841
That's what hurts the most, Cathy.

276
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:34,966
I know. And I can't forget it.

277
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:40,360
We got to, both of us,
or we can't live under the same roof.

278
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:42,643
I know that too.

279
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:46,558
Maybe time will take care of it.

280
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:50,403
I want you to be happy.

281
00:32:51,087 --> 00:32:54,477
I never will be unless you are, Vance.

282
00:32:55,247 --> 00:32:59,479
I hear you lying awake at night.
I know what you're thinking about.

283
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:03,037
Me and Clint, side by side.

284
00:33:03,687 --> 00:33:07,282
Why'd you tell him there was
never anything between us?

285
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:14,483
- You want me to tell him the truth?
- He already knows it. I told him.

286
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,396
Why?

287
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:19,877
Because I don't like
living with a lie.

288
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:23,244
He believed you when you said
you never loved me.

289
00:33:23,407 --> 00:33:28,037
He'll believe you because he loves you
just as much as he loves me.

290
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:33,645
So if he's big enough to forget
what's past, then you can too.

291
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:38,080
Please, Vance.
Please try for my sake.

292
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:20,679
Cathy?

293
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,563
What you doing?

294
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:29,725
- Something wrong?
- No, Clint. Nothing. I was...

295
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:34,563
Cathy, you're crying.
What are you crying about?

296
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:36,319
I don't know, Clint.

297
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:40,366
I had a bad dream, I guess.
The war and everything.

298
00:34:40,527 --> 00:34:44,486
Don't cry. We're all safe again.

299
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:47,081
There's nothing to worry about.

300
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:49,044
I hope not.

301
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:23,076
But to have to lose you again so soon.

302
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:28,397
I knew this was gonna happen, son.

303
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:32,243
I could see the heartbreak
growing in you.

304
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:36,558
I reckon what you're doing is right.

305
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:39,241
There's no other way, Ma.

306
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:42,763
I tried to hide it,
but I can't stay on.

307
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:45,395
Sooner or later Clint would see.

308
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:48,843
- He might guess now anyway.
- No, he won't.

309
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:52,966
I'll tell him I'm going out
to California for a few months.

310
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:55,118
He'll believe it.

311
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:58,359
And the rest of you'll never tell him.

312
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:01,246
When you planning to go?

313
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:03,325
Tomorrow.

314
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:07,641
No, Ma. The quicker the better.

315
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:11,522
Tomorrow we'll go to the raising
of the new schoolhouse.

316
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:16,283
I'll tell Clint and Cathy there,
and leave before they can stop me.

317
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:18,915
They'll both be mighty upset, Vance.

318
00:36:19,087 --> 00:36:24,241
Maybe so, but they won't make a scene
in front of all of our friends.

319
00:36:24,407 --> 00:36:27,126
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

320
00:36:28,807 --> 00:36:32,595
Clint thinks the sun rises
and sets in you.

321
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,883
I know, Ma.

322
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:39,086
That's just why I'm going.

323
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:56,956
What's wrong?

324
00:36:57,127 --> 00:37:00,756
My, you girls look pretty.
I have to keep an eye on you.

325
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,519
Go on, Clint.

326
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:07,602
Ray, tell the fellas to hurry it up.
We don't want to miss any of the fun.

327
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:12,085
Ninety, ninety-five, two.

328
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:14,681
How come you're only taking 200?

329
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:17,315
You all need it more than I do.

330
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:21,076
Give Ma the rest of my share.

331
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:24,523
Tell her how we got it
and that it's rightfully ours.

332
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:29,158
- It isn't fair, giving up everything.
- Come on, take more than $200.

333
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:31,636
You gotta have a stake out West.

334
00:37:31,807 --> 00:37:34,560
I'll get a job somewhere.
Don't worry.

335
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:37,719
Now, come on. Act natural.

336
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:41,402
I don't want Clint and Cathy
to suspect anything.

337
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:47,043
CLINT:
Come on, fellas!

338
00:37:56,127 --> 00:37:57,560
What kept you so long?

339
00:37:57,727 --> 00:38:01,003
Greasing your hair
for them girls at the picnic?

340
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:09,682
Hey, you missed!
One more!

341
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:12,236
Missed again!
Right this way, folks!

342
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:14,602
Give some money
to build our school!

343
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:16,246
Right this way!

344
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:19,205
MAN:
Pull out those hundred dollar bills!

345
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:23,406
We want the money to build
that schoolhouse over there!

346
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:26,479
There's one of the best roofers
in the county!

347
00:38:47,447 --> 00:38:50,723
We want the money
to build that schoolhouse!

348
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:26,477
GIRL 1: Sing another one!
GIRL 2: Yeah, one more!

349
00:40:26,687 --> 00:40:30,839
She's not a day over 20 years old.
She'll last.

350
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,964
What do you mean, going away?
Where?

351
00:42:20,127 --> 00:42:23,597
An old army friend
has a ranch out in California.

352
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:27,521
He needs a partner.
I've been getting restless anyway...

353
00:42:27,687 --> 00:42:30,360
That's not your reason, Vance.

354
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,485
You're leaving because
of me and Clint.

355
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,679
Maybe so.

356
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:41,121
I can't meet his eyes
after what you told me.

357
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:45,237
We don't want you to go.
This is your home. We love you.

358
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:48,639
A home can be full of too much love.

359
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:52,925
Then one night it burns up,
and everybody in it.

360
00:42:54,007 --> 00:42:57,522
I can't face the others,
knowing you left because of me...

361
00:42:57,687 --> 00:42:59,643
...and they knowing it too.

362
00:42:59,887 --> 00:43:02,276
I guess you'll have to learn.

363
00:43:03,207 --> 00:43:05,437
You can't go. You know how I feel.

364
00:43:05,647 --> 00:43:07,877
- Don't say it.
- You know that...

365
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:10,402
Even if it's true, don't say it.

366
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:12,444
Not now.

367
00:43:12,647 --> 00:43:15,036
Not ever.

368
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:38,836
Cathy? What's the matter?

369
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:40,759
What's wrong?

370
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:52,764
- What's wrong?
- I told her I was going away.

371
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:55,077
And I was coming to tell you.

372
00:43:55,247 --> 00:44:00,241
- Away? What do you mean?
- Vance! Ray! Brett!

373
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:03,720
These fellows want to talk to you.

374
00:44:12,287 --> 00:44:16,803
Vance? That's Major Kincaid,
and this gentleman's Mr. Siringo.

375
00:44:17,007 --> 00:44:19,567
Howdy. Won't you light and join us?

376
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:24,158
- No, thanks. This won't take long.
- We hope.

377
00:44:24,807 --> 00:44:29,927
I've been engaged to recover property
lost or stolen during the war.

378
00:44:30,127 --> 00:44:31,719
Well, that's good news.

379
00:44:31,887 --> 00:44:35,197
We lost a lot of things around here.
Want our list?

380
00:44:35,367 --> 00:44:37,278
No, we've got our own.

381
00:44:39,127 --> 00:44:42,881
Three of you brothers were
members of Randall's cavalry...

382
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:46,198
...a unit of which attacked
a railroad station...

383
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:49,723
...on the morning of April 10, 1865.

384
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:51,686
Eight weeks ago.

385
00:44:51,847 --> 00:44:55,442
By impersonating soldiers,
you took an Army payroll...

386
00:44:55,607 --> 00:45:00,886
...amounting to $ 12,250 from
an officer who was on the train.

387
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:03,766
Those may have been your orders...

388
00:45:03,927 --> 00:45:06,282
...but the war was already over...

389
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:09,923
...and had been since noon
of the preceding day.

390
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:13,801
- Any idea what he's talking about?
- No.

391
00:45:13,967 --> 00:45:15,798
He's got us mixed up.

392
00:45:15,967 --> 00:45:19,039
We found one of the men
who got away with you...

393
00:45:19,207 --> 00:45:22,199
...and we recovered his share
of the money.

394
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:25,325
- He told us who stole the rest.
- He's lying.

395
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:29,361
Don't be foolish. I've known you
since you was knee-high.

396
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:35,204
I'd hate to see you get into trouble.
If you got the money, give it back.

397
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:37,756
We didn't steal any money, Ed.

398
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:42,206
Well, that's possible,
but we mean to make sure.

399
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:45,882
The paymaster can identify the men
who took the money.

400
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:47,799
We're taking you to him.

401
00:45:47,967 --> 00:45:51,118
Someone wants to see us,
you bring him here.

402
00:45:51,287 --> 00:45:52,845
We're not leaving.

403
00:45:53,007 --> 00:45:58,161
We hoped you'd make no trouble,
but you're all three under arrest.

404
00:45:58,327 --> 00:46:01,319
We're taking you into Tyler.
Get your horses.

405
00:46:01,487 --> 00:46:06,197
You got no right to do this!
They never lied or stole from nobody.

406
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:08,756
Stay out of this, Clint.

407
00:46:13,647 --> 00:46:16,400
Go on. Get the horses.

408
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:20,966

409
00:46:21,127 --> 00:46:25,439
Now, don't worry, Ma.
Everything's gonna be all right.

410
00:46:25,607 --> 00:46:27,996
Don't you worry.

411
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:41,442
Don't worry, Martha.
I'll go with them.

412
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:45,040
If that man recognizes you,
we're done for.

413
00:46:45,207 --> 00:46:47,402
How can he?
We were bearded then.

414
00:46:47,567 --> 00:46:50,445
He can't tell us now from Adam.

415
00:46:56,127 --> 00:46:59,756
What happened, Mr. Vance?
You boys in some trouble?

416
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:02,043
Nothing serious, Jethro.

417
00:47:02,207 --> 00:47:04,926
Just a little misunderstanding.

418
00:47:05,087 --> 00:47:07,999
We'll get it cleared up right shortly.

419
00:47:23,327 --> 00:47:26,876
- It's a frame-up.
- There must be something behind it.

420
00:47:27,047 --> 00:47:30,244
- Sure there is.
- Go on, get me some hot water.

421
00:47:30,407 --> 00:47:35,197
They want revenge on Randall's men
for driving them crazy during the war.

422
00:47:35,367 --> 00:47:39,599
Start making up charges,
like stealing money or something.

423
00:47:39,767 --> 00:47:44,966
- What'll they do with Vance?
- They'll put him in a stinking prison.

424
00:47:46,527 --> 00:47:48,165
What's the matter, Clint?

425
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:53,003
Well, why did you say just Vance?
We're worried about all three of them.

426
00:47:54,487 --> 00:47:57,604
Well, of course we are.
That's what I meant.

We're friends of your brothers.

435
00:48:37,687 --> 00:48:41,077
Is there any of them around?
Vance, Brett or Ray?

436
00:48:41,247 --> 00:48:43,078
No, why?

437
00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:47,038
We come to warn him.
Some men are looking for him.

438
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:51,280
Too late. They arrested them
this morning on some lying charge.

439
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:54,479
It was a lie, wasn't it?

440
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:56,638
- Sure.
- Where'd they take them?

441
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:00,323
To town. They're taking a train
to Tyler to stand trial.

442
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:02,717

We've got to stop him.

Who are you, men? How do we know
you're friends of Vance?

Don't worry, miss.
We know you well enough.

You're Cathy.

448
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:26,681
Vance must've showed us your picture
a thousand times.

449
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:31,086
Ain't it natural that his brother
wants to help get him free?

00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,319

I understand how you might feel
about this money.

454
00:50:57,367 --> 00:51:01,519
Even if they don't identify you,
they can send you to prison.

The three of you.

456

I don't want to send you to prison.
All I want is to recover the money.

457
00:51:12,887 --> 00:51:15,526
I'll make you a fair proposition.

458
00:51:15,687 --> 00:51:18,121
Tell me you'll give me the money.

459
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:22,803
I give you my word we'll drop
the charges. Forget the whole thing.

If the war had gone the other way...

468

him instead of me.

00:52:07,247 --> 00:52:10,637

can't give you more than we've got.

I can agree with you.

00:54:58,567 --> 00:55:02,276
Now, I'm gonna get him my way.
And the money.

501
00:55:09,367 --> 00:55:13,201
- All right, Clint. Get on back home.
- Why?

502
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:15,562
Go on before somebody sees you.

503
00:55:15,727 --> 00:55:20,960
- A lot of thanks for helping you.
- I didn't want your help. None of you.

504
00:55:21,127 --> 00:55:25,882
- You was being took to prison!
- I could've made a deal with Siringo.

505
00:55:26,047 --> 00:55:29,562
We'll be halfway to the Mississippi
by morning.

506
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:33,356
- Head down river, he can't catch us.
- Hold on, hold on.

507
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:37,642
We're gonna get off the road
and settle this now.

Ed, Pardee, Mike.

509
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:55,846
I led you through four years of war,
and I never steered you wrong, did I?

510
00:55:56,367 --> 00:56:00,519
So you ought to know that nobody
hates giving up more than I do.

511
00:56:00,687 --> 00:56:04,805
But these men will hound us
until we're dead or behind bars.

512
00:56:04,967 --> 00:56:09,836
So you did take the payroll.
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

513
00:56:10,007 --> 00:56:12,521
We felt we had
a right to it, Clint.

514
00:56:12,687 --> 00:56:16,236
We did have a right to it.
You told us that yourself.

515
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:18,477
What changed your mind?

516
00:56:18,847 --> 00:56:20,803
Siringo and common sense.

517
00:56:20,967 --> 00:56:24,482
He said he'd forget everything
if we return the money.

518
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:29,721
I bet he'll still do it, in spite of
that holdup. Nobody was hurt.

519
00:56:29,927 --> 00:56:33,840
I vote we give it back.
The money isn't worth that risk.

520
00:56:34,007 --> 00:56:37,920
I agree. We've been shot at
enough for one lifetime.

521
00:56:38,087 --> 00:56:39,725
What about you?

522
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:45,283
You two boys can do as you please.
I'm keeping my share.

523
00:56:46,047 --> 00:56:48,800
- Me too.
- And me.

524
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:53,085
You'll never get away with it.
They'll scour the country.

525
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:56,239
- They'll shoot on sight.
- We'll take our chances.

526
00:56:56,407 --> 00:56:59,922
Don't be stupid.
There's nothing in this but trouble.

527

Your trouble is, you lost your guts.
Come on, boys.

Hold it.

529
00:57:06,807 --> 00:57:10,641
This deal is only good
if we turn in all the money.

530
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:14,641
So if I gotta save your necks too,
that's the way it is.

531
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:17,401
Get it. And their guns.

532
00:57:20,487 --> 00:57:22,921
Now I'm going back to get our shares.

533
00:57:23,087 --> 00:57:26,636
I'll meet you right after daybreak
at Hanna's mill.

534
00:57:30,607 --> 00:57:32,916
Brett, that means you and Ray too.

How do we know you aren't lying?

536
00:57:35,287 --> 00:57:38,916
Maybe this here Siringo
didn't make you any deal at all.

537
00:57:39,087 --> 00:57:42,284
Yeah, and even if he did,
how good is his word?

538
00:57:42,447 --> 00:57:44,324
I trust it.

Nobody knows you're in on this.

541
00:57:51,207 --> 00:57:55,962
Go into town and tell Siringo
I'll bring the money tomorrow morning.

You come to the mill
and give us his answer.

That satisfy you?

00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:04,556
What choice have we got?

545
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:07,277
Go on, Clint. Get going.

00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:44,319
If the money's here,
they must have buried it.

Martha, if you know where
it is or where the boys are...

But I don't know.
They had no money.

We haven't seen them since
you took them off yesterday.

555
00:59:56,487 --> 01:00:01,436
It's the truth. Can't you believe us?
We don't know more than what you said.

came to his place after daylight.

Jethro fetched the money...

to meet Vance.

- That's right. She's my wife.

of knowing what Siringo told Clint.

If it's no, they'll kill you.

638
01:10:36,127 --> 01:10:40,166
It's a chance I gotta take.
Clint will be waiting at the mill.

639
01:10:40,327 --> 01:10:44,286
- What if he isn't?
- Go to town, give him back the money.

01:10:44,487 --> 01:10:50,483
So you stay here and I'll send
someone for you by nightfall.

642
01:11:25,687 --> 01:11:28,247
What makes you sure
they're headed west?

643
01:11:28,407 --> 01:11:31,797
You ain't in cahoots on this,
by any chance?

644
01:11:31,967 --> 01:11:36,404
Then you lose us and join them.
That could be the plan.

645
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:39,479
You think I'd send my
wife out to get shot?

646
01:11:39,647 --> 01:11:44,243
Maybe not. If her and Vance is
put on, you've got us to settle with.

647
01:11:44,447 --> 01:11:48,281
Ain't nothing put on with them.
They put one over on us.

648
01:11:48,447 --> 01:11:50,722
Shut up. I don't
wanna hear no more.

649
01:11:50,887 --> 01:11:55,677
- Then find them. And fast.
- Don't worry, I've got more reason.

650
01:11:55,887 --> 01:11:59,402
If he finds them, he won't
listen. He's half crazy.

651

He's probably hiding out until...

652
01:12:03,967 --> 01:12:08,085
Hey, hold on. I know where
he might be. Let them ride on.

653
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:36,281
I was right.
That's Cathy's mare.

654
01:12:46,687 --> 01:12:50,521
Then he went to the mill,
taking the money with him.

655
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:54,043
When he doesn't find you,
he'll go into town alone.

01:12:54,207 --> 01:12:56,084
We figured that's how it was.

657
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:58,715

01:12:58,927 --> 01:13:01,885
- Clint thinks you run off with Vance.
- I did...

659
01:13:02,047 --> 01:13:06,677
No, I don't mean like that.
He thinks you left him for good.

660
01:13:07,887 --> 01:13:11,323
That's not true.
Whoever put that idea in his head?

01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:15,116
Gavin's bunch. They think
Vance took the money and you.

662
01:13:15,287 --> 01:13:19,439
I tried to reason with him.
He wouldn't listen. He's jealous.

663
01:13:19,607 --> 01:13:22,963
If he finds Vance,
there's no telling what he'll do.

664
01:13:23,127 --> 01:13:26,961
- Let me talk to him. Where is he?
- Come on, we'll find him.

665
01:13:28,607 --> 01:13:32,600
What proof do you want?
Your brothers cut loose to join them.

666
01:13:32,767 --> 01:13:36,396
They was all in this together.
This one's leading us on.

667
01:13:36,567 --> 01:13:38,319
You'll see if I am.

668
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:42,276
All I want is to find them if it
takes the rest of my life.

669
01:14:16,087 --> 01:14:17,679
Clint...

670
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:22,443
- Where is he?
- Better listen careful to her, Clint.

671
01:14:22,607 --> 01:14:24,723
You believe what they told you?

672
01:14:24,887 --> 01:14:28,323
I reckon I've always known.
This just plain showed me.

673
01:14:28,567 --> 01:14:31,479
- Let me tell you. Listen...
- Quit lying to me!

674
01:14:31,647 --> 01:14:34,036
I believed your lies
like you wanted.

675
01:14:34,207 --> 01:14:37,165
Like the night you stood
at our window crying.

676
01:14:37,687 --> 01:14:40,759
When you ran from me
because of what Vance said.

677
01:14:40,927 --> 01:14:42,599
No, listen, and let me...

678
01:14:42,847 --> 01:14:46,522
- Give her the chance!
- For what, to deny it? She can't!

679
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:49,804
Go on, say I'm lying!
Say he weren't your lover!

680
01:14:49,967 --> 01:14:52,640
Say you ain't laid
awake thinking of him!

681
01:14:52,807 --> 01:14:56,163
Wishing I was Vance!
Wishing you'd never married me!

682
01:14:56,327 --> 01:14:57,999
Shut up! None of it's so.

683
01:14:58,167 --> 01:15:00,806
Tell me he hasn't held
you or kissed you.

684
01:15:00,967 --> 01:15:04,596
- You're hurting me!
- You can't say it because it's true.

685
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:08,686
- You're lying! You love him!
- No! Stop it!

686
01:15:08,847 --> 01:15:11,122
- You're lying! You love him!
- Stop!

687
01:15:11,327 --> 01:15:15,798
- I know you do! I ought to kill you.
- You're crazier than a mad duck!

688
01:15:15,967 --> 01:15:18,322
You would've killed her!

689
01:15:18,487 --> 01:15:21,081
You know what you meant to each other
as well as I do!

690
01:15:21,247 --> 01:15:23,556
You're just trying to protect her.

691
01:15:28,247 --> 01:15:29,885
Hold it, Ray.

692
01:15:31,087 --> 01:15:32,884
Come on.

693
01:15:33,967 --> 01:15:35,685
You're going home.

694
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:42,283
Go back where we found you.

695
01:15:42,447 --> 01:15:47,077
Wait for Vance in case he returns.
Warn him. Tell him to stay there.

696
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,887
Now, get out of here.
Go on.

697
01:15:52,687 --> 01:15:57,158
I sent her home. Now, you're going
into town with us. Get mounted.

698
01:15:57,327 --> 01:15:58,885
Hold it, Brett.

699
01:15:59,927 --> 01:16:02,157
They're lying about her going home.

700
01:16:02,327 --> 01:16:05,399
She's heading back to him.
We gotta follow her.

701
01:16:05,567 --> 01:16:08,798
That's a lie!
Vance is on his way to find us.

702
01:16:09,047 --> 01:16:11,277
With the money to meet Siringo.

703
01:16:11,487 --> 01:16:13,717
You think we're
gonna swallow that?

704
01:16:13,887 --> 01:16:15,684
Pardee, get their guns.

705
01:16:21,367 --> 01:16:23,483
Give Clint back his gun.

706
01:16:23,927 --> 01:16:27,078
You can do what you want.
We're trailing her.

707
01:16:27,287 --> 01:16:30,882
You're right.
They're still trying to throw us off.

708
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:37,886
Now, you two can go back
to the mill or to Hades...

709
01:16:38,087 --> 01:16:41,875
...but don't follow us.
Let's go, boys.

710
01:16:47,407 --> 01:16:49,363
We gotta find Vance, but where?

711
01:16:49,527 --> 01:16:54,157
If he's not at the mill, we'll try
to catch him before he gets to town.

712
01:17:29,887 --> 01:17:33,004
GAVIN: What'd I tell you?
She led us straight to him.

713
01:17:45,687 --> 01:17:49,282
- Where is he?
- Don't know. Brett told you the truth.

714
01:17:49,447 --> 01:17:53,486
- You're protecting him!
- Leave her alone. That ain't helping.

715
01:17:53,647 --> 01:17:57,003
He wouldn't have left her
unless he was coming back.

716
01:17:57,167 --> 01:18:00,477
So we'll just sit here
until he walks in.

717
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:26,885
VANCE:
Ray! Brett!

718
01:18:31,367 --> 01:18:34,439
So now they're gunning
for you. Clint with them.

719
01:18:34,607 --> 01:18:36,837
They think you
double-crossed them.

720
01:18:37,007 --> 01:18:41,683
Maybe we can knock some sense into
their heads before anybody gets hurt.

721
01:18:42,767 --> 01:18:44,883
First we gotta get rid of this.

722
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:50,204
Ray, ride into town. Give it
to Siringo, tell him what's happened.

723
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,482
Where are you going?

724
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,683
We'll get to the cave and wait.

725
01:18:53,927 --> 01:18:57,283
You bring what help you can.
Now, get going.

726
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:03,724
Vance? He'll never give you
the chance to explain now.

727
01:19:03,967 --> 01:19:08,404
We tried. So did Cathy.
Clint came near to killing her for it.

728
01:19:08,647 --> 01:19:09,966
He'll listen to me.

729
01:19:10,127 --> 01:19:13,881
I'm warning you.
He's more dangerous than any of them.

730
01:19:22,567 --> 01:19:25,081
That's him. With Brett.

731
01:19:26,927 --> 01:19:29,122
Get out of sight. Watch her.

732
01:19:29,367 --> 01:19:31,278
Wait until they get up close.

733
01:19:34,407 --> 01:19:38,082
- They got here ahead of us.
- They're up there with her.

734
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:40,482
They must've seen us coming.

735
01:19:46,647 --> 01:19:49,286
You stay here.
This is my job.

736
01:19:49,687 --> 01:19:52,724
Any one of them
is liable to shoot you.

737
01:19:52,967 --> 01:19:57,518
Not Clint. He couldn't.
And he'd stop the man who tried.

738
01:19:57,767 --> 01:20:00,281
You haven't seen his face.

739
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:02,680
Clint!

740
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:07,683
Can you hear me, Clint?

741
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:23,677
I know what you're thinking, Clint!
But you got it all wrong! Dead wrong!

742
01:20:28,567 --> 01:20:31,718
All Cathy did was
to bring me the money!

743
01:20:31,967 --> 01:20:36,085
There's nothing else between us!
I swear it! Nothing at all!

744
01:20:37,327 --> 01:20:39,477
Well, I know different, don't I?

745
01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:46,599
I was going away, Clint!
And I'm still going, for good!

746
01:20:46,767 --> 01:20:50,396
I had to square things
with Siringo first. I've done it!

747
01:20:50,567 --> 01:20:55,482
He couldn't have. He ain't had
time to get to town and back.

748
01:20:56,287 --> 01:20:59,040
It's a scheme.
He's trying to draw us out.

749
01:20:59,207 --> 01:21:03,883
Listen to me, Clint! Ray's going
in to take Siringo the money!

750
01:21:04,127 --> 01:21:07,278
That'll give us clean hands,
all of us!

751
01:21:09,367 --> 01:21:13,804
Unless one of you loses his
head now and adds killing to it!

752
01:21:14,047 --> 01:21:19,679
He's lying to you about the money.
He's still got it on him.

753
01:21:19,927 --> 01:21:24,557
He only came back for her.
And she knows it.

754
01:21:31,647 --> 01:21:34,207
Why don't you answer me, Clint?

755
01:21:34,447 --> 01:21:38,281
What's stopping you?
Can't you see he's just stalling?

756
01:21:38,487 --> 01:21:41,081
Working closer until he can jump us?

757
01:21:41,847 --> 01:21:44,725
Probably got Ray and Brett
working behind us.

VANCE:
What's troubling you?

759
01:21:46,887 --> 01:21:49,606
Well, go on.
You asked for him. Take him.

760
01:21:49,767 --> 01:21:55,125
I got no reason to lie to you. I only
came to tell you our trouble's over.

761
01:21:55,367 --> 01:21:57,722
We can go home with nothing to fear!

762
01:21:57,967 --> 01:22:02,882
Go home.
Go home to what?

763
01:22:05,447 --> 01:22:09,486
Well, go on. Take him.
Now! Or I'll take him myself.

Come on! Let's get
the money and get out of here!

767
01:22:42,967 --> 01:22:46,880
Get away from him!
Leave him alone!

Hey, don't move.
Just lie still.

771
01:23:30,727 --> 01:23:37,075
Cathy, where's Vance?
I got to talk to him.

772
01:23:37,287 --> 01:23:41,326
- Right here, Clint.
- Vance, I didn't mean it.

773
01:23:41,487 --> 01:23:44,399
I know you didn't.
You don't have to tell me.
